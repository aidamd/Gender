hey, soos, look. a glowing dot.  oh, man, i am so glad i turned my head.  that dot does not disappoint.  right. like i'm gonna fall for that.  aaah. gimme that money, sonny.   there's your cue.  it's the perfect moment to ask wendy to dance.  good luck, me.  i don't need luck.i have a plan.  aaah.  wwhat are you doing here.  i mean, wouldn't you rather be out on the dance floor, uh, in, like, exactly 42 seconds.  i'm just waiting for the bathroom.  um, um, okay.  ..  so, hey, let's say everyone at this party gets stuck on a desert island.  who do you think the leader would be.  ..uhi think i'd go with this lunatic.    i'd probably go for stretch over there.  uh, because tall people can reach coconuts.   speaking of tall, want to see something.  ..  boop.  ha. you were a freak.  yep.  you know, kids used to make fun of my birthmark before i started hiding it all the time.  birthmark. uh, no, it's nothing.  .  no way, dude. now you have to show me.  show me, show me.  the big dipper.  that's how you got your nickname.  i thought your parents just hated you or something.  hey, i guess we're both freaks.   wait here. of course.   hey.  .  number ten had been distracting soos for 15 minutes.  he's gonna get tired of that dot eventually.  soos: never.  i bumped into wendy accidentally and things are actually going great.  do we have to remind you.   oh, man, you guys sound crazy.  look, maybe we don't need the plan anymore, ya know.  maybe i could just go talk to her like a normal person.   you bite your tongue.  if you're not gonna stick to the plan, maybe you shouldn't be the dipper to dance with wendy.  if you think about it...  we said we weren't gonna turn on each other.  i think we all knew we were lying.  no. no. hey.   pacs.  you'd be surprisedhow few loads you actually get from abottle of detergent.  because a lot of peoplepour in a little extra.  and that reducestheir total loads.  but with tide pods, one pac equals one load.  so try tide pods, and pop in value.  uhh.  no, wait.  aaah. i can't breathe in here. clone: yeah, you can.  plus there's snacks and a coloring book in there for you.  ohh.  okay, so now that original dipperor "dipper classic"is no longer fit for it, i nominate myself to dance with wendy instead.  i've been around the longest, so it should be me.  right. i mean, logically. logically, guys.  fair point, fair point.  maybe i should get to dance with wendy because i've been around for the least.  that makes, like, zero sense.  you make zero sense.  watch it. don't shove people.  nyinyinyinyi.  aaaah.  hey, you want some cheese and crackers, buddy.   huh. huh.  yikes.  hey, guys.  what would you do if you were trapped in a closet.  all: break out.  wend) ) come on, man, give it up. you're overpowered.

pacifica, but we have each other, and that is pretty good, i think.  soos. play another song.  .   some night, huh.  you think we really even have a chance with wendy.  i mean, she's 15, we're 12.  i don't know, man. i hope so.  but we're making zero progress the way we're doing it.  the only good conversation you had with hery of that list stuff.  mabel was right, i do get in my own way.  literally. literally.  whoa...  oh, boy, don't look now.  tyrone. it's okay, dude, i had a good run.  remember what we talked about.  uh, of course.  hey, and quit being such a wimp around wendy,
