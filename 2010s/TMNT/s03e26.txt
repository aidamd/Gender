previously on teenage mutant ninja turtles   you fool. i'm sorry i lied to you zog, but i can't let you invade our world. i'll squash you.  zog. zog. take my hand. long live the triceraton empire. no. no.  whoa, that triceraton sounds so cool. i wish i could have fought a real, live dinodude. yeah, right. that dinodude would have stomped you into a casey puddle in about five seconds flat. whatever, raph. casey jones eats dinosaur meat for breakfast. ugh. i'm just amazed there are more aliens out there in the universe other than the kraang. i hate to break up the conversation guys, but someone's been following us for the last five blocks or so. weird. i don't sense anyone at all. see for yourself.  it's a kraang. stay on him leo. he's gone. check it out what's that supposed to be his logo. it's a chess piece. a bishop. teenage mutant ninja turtles teenage mutant ninja turtles teenage mutant ninja turtles heroes in a half shell, turtle power here we go, it's a lean, green ninja team on the scene, cool teens doing ninja things so extreme, out the sewer like laser beams get rocked with the shellshocked pizza kings can't stop these radical dudes the secret of the ooze made the chosen few emerge from the shadows to make their move the good guys win, and the bad guys lose leonardo's the leader in blue does anything it takes to get his ninjas through donatello is the fellow who has a way with machines raphael's got the most attitude on the team michelangelo, he's one of a kind and you know just where to find him when it's party time master splinter taught 'em every single skill they need to be one lean, mean, green, incredible team teenage mutant ninja turtles teenage mutant ninja turtles teenage mutant ninja turtles heroes in a half shell, turtle power for the record, i still think this is a terrible idea, leo. it's got to be a trap. something's up. and i'm gonna find out what. dudes, this is the same meat warehouse where we fought tiger claw. come on, i know a back entrance.  shh.  casey, stop. goongala.  do not do this. all: hyah. mikey. i am not here to fight you. too late for that.   that's impossible.  turtles, refrain from attacking. believe me when i say, i am not your enemy. you can call me by my earth name bishop. but you look just like a kraang. i was the one who created this body. the other kraang copied me. i am a member of the utrom tribe a small group of kraang defectors. we broke away from the kraang hive mind many centuries ago. fascinating. it makes sense the kraang share a hive mind a really stupid hive mind. i have broken my utrom vow not to intervene in earthly matters, but i must warn you, the triceratons are coming. the triceratons. as in plural. but we stopped the beacon. no. they are coming, and they are carrying enough firepower to destroy the entire solar system.  can you repeat that last part. the news gets worse. the kraang have finally fixed the technodrome and are about to invade once more. you have any more terrible news, bishop, or is that it. if the triceratons arrive when the technodrome rises, they will hone in on this planet and vaporize it. sorry i asked. bishop, why do the triceratons hate the kraang. for millennia, the two species have fought over dimension x. the kraang use their intelligence to battle their foe, while the triceratons relied on brute strength and cunning. it seemed the triceratons would win, but the kraang used the most powerful weapon in the universe a blackhole generator that wiped out the triceraton's entire planet. only a single triceraton fleet survived. they vowed vengeance. the battle may have ended, but the war has not. it still rages across dimension x. now, shall we begin.  they are still asleep. do not worry, leatherhead. they will heal in time, but they need rest. thank you, great splinter, for caring for my friends. we're back, everyone, and we brought a new pal. kra kra kraang.  no, wait. i do not want to fight you, creature.  leatherhead, calm down, dude. it's okay. this is bishop. he's a good kraang an oolong.  utrom. he's not like the others.  i do not trust him. well, you got to trust him for now, lh. he's totally cool. he's gonna help us fight the kraang. all right, here's the plan raph, donnie, mikey, and leatherhead, you take the sub. infiltrate and stop the technodrome before it launches, and if it does launch, the rest of us will take it out in the turtle blimp. the technodrome. leonardo, what is going on here. you just have to trust me when i say the whole world is at stake, and only we can save it. go, then. i will help slash and rockwell. if you need me, i will stay close to the cheese phone. finally. after two earth years of repairs, miscalculations, and general messups, the technodrome's ready to fly again. voil.   what is that which is known as the problem, kraang subprime. oh, uh, just a sec, oh, bloated one. just got to give her some more juice.  all right, let's hope raph's team can take down the 'drome. and if they cannot, we must destroy it at any cost.  kraang subprime will get this baby started in two shakes of a tentacle.   yes. i did it. i rule. both: the technodrome rises.  oh, no. that is so awesome and terrifying. raph, you guys have two minutes to blow that thing before we do. back off, man. we're headed to the core now. heads up, guys.  uh        finally, i can hear myself think. where to, leatherhead. this way. wah.  this way. this way. aah. okay, that way. that way. turtle and alligator mutants, you will raise that which is known as forelimbs.  no retreat, no surrender.   now, this is definitely bad. kraang subprime, that which is known as a balloon is heading for that which is knows as oh, just spit it out already. okay. look. you got to be kraanging me. i told you it wouldn't be big enough to bring down the ship. casey jones knows explosives. wasn't the point, casey. we just need a way in.   where to, bishop. this way.   well, if it isn't the turtles and that stupid alligator thing that shouts "kraang" all the time. welcome, earth creatures. you are about to enjoy that which is known as the invasion of earth.   both: huh. what now. seriously.  the the triceratons. not the triceratons. not here. not now. greetings, sublifeforms of earth. i am captain mozar of the triceraton empire. let it be known, your planet is infested with kraang an insidious alien bent on mutating earth into their own home world. we triceratons will eliminate these hideous aliens, freeing you of their vile plans. unfortunately, your earth will be annihilated as well. that is all. and, please, have a nice day. holy chalupa. it's actually happening. double invasion. goongala.    get off my roboback. bishop. you filthy, swindling kraang. i am an utrom, just as you once were, brother. or shall i call you subsubprime. don't call me that. you know i hate that. hurry, my friends, get to the hangar. thanks, bishop. let's go. move it, guys. it's too late to blow this thing. pair up and grab a ship. dibs. i'm driving. i want to drive. mmmmmm.  they're not just targeting the technodrome. they're heading for the city. then push this thing faster, leo.  ah, look out. whoa.  over there. that way. now 9:00. we make a pretty good team, even though the odds of us surviving this are 967to1. whoohoo.  yeah, dog. and sensei says video games are useless. how else could i learn to do this. whoo. this is the coolest thing ever.  they made it, but the technodrome's still flying. not for long it's not. look.  whoa.  we've been hit. we're going down. grab on to something.     my friends, are you okay. i've always hated roller coasters.   captain mozar, we have the technodrome on target. excellent. destroy it. and unleash the heart of darkness upon the city. we will make sure the kraang never take this world again by annihilating it. mikey, look. they're leaving. yes.  uhoh. the triceratons are powering up. we're toast. toast.   both: whoa.  did we make it. i think so. at least the technodrome's down. maybe the battle's finally over.  dude. dude. there's a ship holding some kind of energy string. it's carrying some kind of giant thingy. you're not making any sense, mikey.  it looks like a weapon. ah, crud, guys, i think they're heading for washington square. i got this, chief. oh, yeah. turtle spaceship power. they have force field awesomeness. mayday. mayday. we're going down, dog.  april. i need you and leatherhead to get splinter and the rest of the mutanimals. gather as many of our friends as you can. i'll text everyone a place to meet up, cool. what's the deal, leo. the deal is, we're gonna need all the help we can get.  those triceratons are scientists. their job is to program the blackhole generator. oh, right. those are the soldiers. okay, we're gonna need the rest of the guys here fast. are we enough for ya. oh, no, look. for the triceraton empire. they're draining the city's energy supply to power up the weapon. you mean no tv. that ain't right. all right, team, this could be our last battle. are you ready.   earth creatures. attack. aah. hey.  take out their weapons.   bishop. no. bishop. no.  we heard you might need some assistance. splinter. and reinforcements. yes.    casey. red. guys, um, you do realize we're still in extraordinarily horrendous trouble, right. so what do we do. kick their jurassic. cowabunga.  waah.   mikey. hyah.   goongala.  maybe i need an upgrade. casey.   awesome save, red. thanks. cowabunga. it's time for mondo gecko to open a can of ugh.  oh big feet. ugh. mondo. stay away from my pal, you alien freak.    we must stop the blackhole weapon from being triggered. slash, leatherhead, take that machine down now.  you destroy the weapon.   not even a scratch.     great scott. more are about to beam down.  no. you vile, extinct  oh, drat.    no. dinofreaks. this battle is over. you have all lost.  leatherhead.  foolish little one. you are coming with me.  mikey. michelangelo.   casey. no. i'll come back for you. we got to go, sensei. retreat. everyone retreat.  huh. this little baby might come in hand ow.    captain mozar, sir, you have captured an earth creature. a mutant species of some kind, rare to the planet.  i used to think dinosaurs were cool, but not you guys. why are you doing this, dinodude. why can't you just leave earth alone. why. because of the kraang. we will not let them take this planet. they want it as a hiding place from dimension x, a back door where we triceratons cannot detect them. so we will simply destroy your planet and all of the kraang hiding there. but we don't want the kraang here either. can't we all just get along. no. the decision has been made by the triceraton emperor. it cannot be changed. aah. aah. get off of me dorkasaurus.  should i take him to the brig, sir. no, ready the psionic extractor.  the psionic extractor. but, sir we only use it on our greatest war criminals. it is too horrible and cruel even for the likes of silence. do as i command.   wow.  that looks like it's really gonna hurt. more than you can possibly imagine, creature.      we got to go back for them, sensei. we can't just leave them there.  and what about mikey. what are they gonna do to him up there in that freaky ship probe him. first we must destroy the blackhole machine. that is the priority. if we cannot stop this weapon, the entire world is doomed.  sensei, i think it's gonna take some time for the triceratons to fix all the damage slash caused. we got to go after mikey. even if we stop the generator, we still have to get him back. go, then. save your brother. april and i will stop the triceratons and rescue our friends. uh, by ourselves. uh, you're, uh, kidding, right, sensei. we will ally ourselves with someone even more powerful than the mighty mutanimals. who, sensei. the shredder.   is the terran ready for psionic extraction.  hold up, dinodudes. let's talk about this. for reals, though. this machine will drain all of your knowledge of earth and the kraang. and in the process, your psyche will be sliced, diced, chopped, and removed from your puny brain. i don't have the biggest psycho, but i like what i got.  activate the extractor.       wow, yeah, so cool. look at that. it's like a triple rainbow, brah. whoo, yeah. my teeth feel like batteries.  i'm faster than light.  turn it off. turn it off now.   dude, why did you stop. that was better than, like, 100 million rollercoaster rides in outer space. can i do it again. can i. please. shut up. shut up. shut up. what knowledge did you extract. very little useful information, captain. the only thought the creature seems to have is for a substance called pizza.  destroy the pathetic alien.  whoa, whoa, whoa. hold up. i know stuff. you know nothing. i know all the secret bases where the kraang hide in dimension x. hmm.        hey, girl, who do you think opened that door for you.   bad move, rat. breaking in here, are you desperate or just fools. we're not here to whoa. ha. is rocksteady late for party time.   we have not come to fight you. foolish move, bringing a cub here.     help. april. stop. i wish to know why hamato yoshi has come here. perhaps to end his miserable existence. our feud is meaningless in the face of this invasion, saki. the world will soon be destroyed. will you sit by and watch. or will you help us save it. what have you done with karai. we searched for her, but she is gone. alive, but vanished from the city. you lie. he's telling the truth, shredder. karai's still out there somewhere. and if the earth blows up, guess what. you'll never see her again. so maybe you can do the right thing for once in your evil life, even be a hero for a change, that is, if you still love karai. mm. there's mikey's ship. told you i saw it come down this way. wow. not a bad park job either.  more aliens. run. ugh, humans are so annoying sometimes. the mothership is approximately roughly half the distance from the earth to the moon. all right, i think i'm getting the hang of this.    blech. turtles were definitely not meant to go to space.   hold on. let me turn on the artificial gravity.    guys, i see it.  the mothership. okay, but where's mikey. i'm detecting a unique life signature coming from the closest craft. it's got to be him. and check it out i think i finally figured out the cloak on this baby.  they'll never find us now. idiots. they think they can hide from us. tragic mistake. ha. my brothers are gonna come rescue me and kick your dinobutt back to the stone age. that's right straight back to the 1960s. we shall see. commander zorin, deploy a squadron of fighters. sergeant zark, activate the plasma cannon.  okay. um, this is disturbing. ugh, don't make me throw up again. i think the triceratons are locking on to us with their weapons. floor it, leo. go, go, go, go. how can they see us, donnie. let me text them and find out. i have no idea.  raph, man the defenses. i'm on it.  ugh. aah. yes. yeah. ugh. look out, leo. left, left. ugh. would you let me drive. we're not gonna make it. there's just too many of 'em, captain.   all: uh  all: aah.  all: aah.  aah. we're alive. you snagged a teleporter. you mean we could've just beamed here. there's only one charge, and i  oh, man, we're in trouble.  guys, that was awesome. thanks for the sweet rescue. so who's gonna rescue us next april, casey.   heh, heh. halt. yoohoo   oh. ugh. huh. ha.  we must remain stealthy.   um, whatever we do, we better do it fast.  the timer is repaired. this planet has mere nextons to live. we must not waste time, master. we must oh, no.  captain mozar, please. don't destroy the earth. our world has so much potential. the humans of your world are as thoughtless as the kraang. they pollute the planet, erode its ozone willingly, and they don't even need mutagen to do it. escort them to the airlock and be done with them.  you can destroy us, mozar. that's okay. it is. but i'm asking you one last time before i take this whole ship down let the earth survive or be destroyed. empty threats. what's this. no, stop. huh.    mikey.  guys, check it out. booyaka      i said let me go. i'm okay. april. red. i knew you wouldn't leave us behind. i'll get you guys out in no time.  come on. yes. thanks, april, you rule. i'm getting the rest of you out. no, there's no time. just go, april.  quickly, run.   hyah.    hurry, saki. we have no time.      all: no.       hold me close, comrade.  shredder, what have you done. hamato yoshi is finished. the earth can be destroyed, for all i care. i have finally won.          hurry. we haven't much time. can we trust him. do we have a choice. long live the triceraton empire. all: long live the triceraton empire. everyone, hold on.   did that just happen. the earth, splinter, everyone, everything gone lost forever in an infinite gravitational singularity. holy pepperoni. watching your entire world vanish into the quantum singularity of a black hole is rather distressing. bloop, bleep. can i offer you some hot cocoa. dude, who are you. my name is professor zayton honeycutt, and you, my friends, are about to embark on a wondrous adventure.  this is awesome. )
