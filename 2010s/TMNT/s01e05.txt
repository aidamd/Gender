" you guys again. all right, stockman. nobody wants to hurt you. we don't. did i miss a meeting. we just want the tpod. give up my source of power. why. so you can laugh at me again. throw me in a dumpster. sounds good to me. what the get it off. get it off. lasers. run. hey stockman. incoming. what now, genius. thanks. hey. haha. oh, yeah. foolish turtles. did you really think you could defeat me. well, yeah. all my life, people have laughed at me. the other kids in school, my coworkers, the woman who fixes the copy machine. how was i supposed to know you don't pour toner in the top. but when they behold the power of this suit, they won't be laughing anymore. they'll tremble in terror. what's happening. stockman and the tpod. they're merging. they're becoming one single entity. the stockmanpod. woowoowoo. the stockmanpod's right on top of us. stop calling him that. that's a stupid name. split up. he can't follow us all. no way. he's gonna follow me. why would he follow you. they always follow me. stop being paranoid and just do it. aah. i told you he was gonna follow me. whoo. haha. pizza. all right. i've got you now. oh yeah. well, i've got hot cheese. is that the best you've shh, guys, quiet. you're gonna wake him up. i'm not making noise. shh. don't tell me to be quiet. shh. sensei. and where have you been. nowhere. how did you get so hurt. oh. that. um, well, we were um hit by a bus. hit by a bus. well, what was i supposed to say. meteor. cow. flying building. enough. tell me what happened. and then i threw hot cheese in his face and ran away. very resourceful, michelangelo. but i'm still highly disappointed in you all. the first rule of being a ninja is "do no harm. " unless you mean to do harm. then do lots of harm. you're right, sensei. i guess we did make a mess of things. so what do you think would be a fitting punishment. we need to clean up our mess. yes. you must stop this stockmanpod. but, sensei, that guy's already kicked our shells. and now he's even more powerful. how are we supposed to stop him. i know. i'll hit him really hard. brute force is not the answer. you will need to rely on your ninja training. excuse me, sensei, but ninjas never had to go up against guys in armor. i mean ninjas always had to go up against guys in armor. nice save. sensei, what was their secret. they understood that you do not fight the armor. you fight the man inside. why are we all looking at each other. are you sure this is gonna work. like sensei said. don't fight the armor. fight the guy inside. and one thing we know about bad guys, they love chasing mikey. guys. stockmanpod's got missiles. now who's trembling in terror. whoa. whoaohoh. mikey. that's it. you're going down. raph. gotcha. any last words. just one. bees. bees. beeees. the tpod. so we'll call it a tie. wanna call it a tie, raph. not yet. no. nooo. now it's a tie. yeah. yeah, boy. you all showed wisdom and great skill in defeating the stockmanpod. i am proud of you all. does this mean we're not grounded anymore. yes. but first randori. )
