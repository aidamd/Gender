"foible" means a weakness of character, shellbrain. master, you've made it through the worst of the worst, and we're gonna make sure that nothing can everything is impermanent, leonardo. you cannot expect anything to last forever, even family. greetings, turtles. leatherhead. good to see you, michelangelo. dude, mondo gecko. when did you join the team, bro. a little while back. they totally love my fighting style. hiyah. hey, where's pigeon pete. we don't talk about pigeon pete. so what brings the mighty mutanimals. we need your help, turtles. we've uncovered plans to develop mutanthunting weapons. i telepathically discovered that don vizioso wants to take control of the city now that shredder has vanished, and the don knows the only thing that stands between him and his vile goals is us. we need to take down the don and his goons before he takes us down. donnie, can you track raph down in the party wagon. if he's out there alone sure, i probably owe him an apology, anyway.    eccellente. vic, vincenzo, welcome. i see you've brought some pest control. best money can buy, don vizioso. it fires miniature rockets that sniff out mutant dna, like a heatseeking missile.  boom, splat. so what are you waiting for, fellas.   once the muties are gone, taking over this town will be a piece of cake, which reminds me. get me a piece of cake.  now go clean the vermin out of the streets, but keep one alive. we'll give 'em to dr. farrell, see what makes the little bugs tick. we should be able to find raph with his tphone signal. i just need to  mondo. please stop touching everything. chill out, bro. once i get this radio working, we can partay.  that's not a        sick of them making me the bad guy all the time. better off living by my own rules.  not having to worry about going too hard on those softshells.  well, look who showed up to help me blow off some steam.  don't need 'em. come on, fellas. let's wrap it up. that's the last bag of cash.  bank robbery.  come on, guys. that's pretty unoriginal.       you got to step up your game if you're gonna commit crimes in my city. raph, what are you doing. getting along fine without you, obviously. raphael. what are you even doing here, geeko. i sometimes throw tantrums too, bro, but friends don't turn their back on their friends.  save it, guys. i am done with you for good. oh, man. he wasn't like this the 26 other times he quit. it's been a long time coming, i can tell you that.  what.     donnie.   the robbery was a setup. they lured us here.      donnie, are you   raph.   raph, they're loaded with mutanthunter rockets. what.     i can't see.           we're not leaving him. come on. hero time with mondo.  get him.    stomp the mutie.  hey, you. all: huh. uh.    raph, no.      boss says to take one for the road. grab the purple one. this one's pretty much finished.    i'm making a snow angel. better take him too, for variety.   aw, man, you messed up big time, raph. muties. here.  hey.   don vizioso, we need to talk.  i get to watch these freaks get whacked from the comfort of my own restaurant. this is truly a gift.  we're not here for a fight, gangster dude. we're here for a truce. but if you don't leave the city peacefully, don vizioso, we are prepared to make you.  get a load of that. it knows my name. know any other tricks.   there are more mutants in this town than you can handle, even with your mutanthunter weapons.  that's exactly why we're not leaving. this city's got a real mutant problem.  we're not going anywhere, 'cause we're human. it's you monsters who don't belong.  chill, dude. leo's got this.  excuse me, mutants.  hello. ah, you don't say. thank you very much. one of your turtle brothers is down. both: no. and the other belongs to us now, as does that little lizard pal of yours. my friend. so it's your move, freaks.             huh.  so long, muties. see you in the funny papers. grab him.   aah.   come on. wastin' mutants: first respectable thing we done for the city.        the don's got a stronghold at the hignight hotel in the bowery. no one gets in, and no one gets out. if he's holding anything valuable, that's where it will be. including captives.  both: huh.  both: raph. whoa. you okay, bro.  i blew it. i led 'em right into a trap. hey, we're a team, and we cover each other's mistakes. we'll get them back. then we better move. whatever he wants donnie and gecko for, it's not good. hey. why don't you make like a tree and scram.   i don't wanna wait for doc farrell. do it now.  do what now. seriously, dudes, i got a cramp in my foot, and i gotta pee real bad. i'll tell ya what we're gonna do. we're gonna see what makes ya tick.   no. um, can we discuss this like rational dudes. i have, like, really sensitive skin when it comes to knives and blades.  if you hold on a sec, i can give you an aplus presentation that explains how mutants work, so you can skip the whole dissection thing.  cool.   hey. what are ya doin'. don't leave your post. whoa.  mutant.  go, go, go, go.   take that, ya filthy mutant.     sorry we can't hang out anymore, fellows.  they found us. no kiddin'. but i got a special surprise to get rid of these creeps, once and for all.  hmm. that wasn't as hard as i thought it would be.   it ain't over yet, big guy.      hey, yo, you mutants are about to go extinct.  bring it.     what.  booyakasha. yes. finally. dudes, get me outta here. i gotta pee so bad. let our friends go.  you turtles don't stand a chance. take a look. your biggest muscle is gettin' pulverized by the hammer. he's my best guy. no one can take him down. then i guess he'll be too busy to protect you. why you destroy 'em. with pleasure.       take care of the don and his goons. i'm gonna help the mutanimals. thanks, raph.    nuts to you for shoplifting me, ya goons. hooha.  look at me now, look at me now.    hey, yo. you're all about to get crushed by the hammer.   hey, hammer. come and get me. i'll carve ya right outta that tin can. what, with those little canopeners. it's your move, creep.   hey, yo, hold still so i can shoot ya.    leatherhead, attack sequence g.     yo.  nice. ha. hey, yo. gonna turn these mutants into street meat.        hey, yo.  aww, nuts.  step back, mutie. i mean it.  hiya. no.    muties. whoa. wow.  that turned out so much better than expected. cowabunga.   i'm glad you're okay, brother. sorry i got so intense when we were sparring. sorry i pushed your buttons, dude. okay, okay, let's stop apologizing. it's makin' me feel weird. it goes to show that you can never let anger separate you. for our time in this world is limited, and how terrible it would be to have unresolved anger for one another. life is short and precious. taco pizza marshmallow surprise. indeed. i'm quite famished.  get it while it's hot and sticky. booyakasha. too slow, bro.   )
