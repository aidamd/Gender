ticked if we watch the "crognard" finale without him. oh, yeah. well the "crognard" finale's gonna be super ticked raph didn't show up on time to watch it.  crognard, to do battle with the dread dragon wigglepuss of the gray northern middle mountains of moorerless is to court destruction. fret not, friend spooch and wise wizardess, for i, crognard the barbarian, will cleave the dread dragon

what's what's going down. you jerks didn't watch the "crognard" finale while i'm stuck on shredder patrol, right. who, us. no, of course not. but i bet if we did watch it, we'd have found it incredibly anticlimate climactic. yeah, well, you better wait until raphael.   we need your help.  rockwell.   docwhere are they. where is "he," or should i say "it," is the better question. and the answer is "gone," for now. what kind of "it" can knock slash out cold. a being not of this world. something beyond monstrous. something i fear will dinoman. ugh. wait, dinoman. some kind of mutant. no, perhaps it's a dinosaur offshoot, evolved in secret over hundreds of millions of years. he's an alien. where you going, brother. if some dinoalien is living in my sewers and beating up my friends, then i'm gonna return the favor. do be careful. he's confused, unpredictable, frantic and hits like a runaway bus.  noted. now get back to the lair so splinter can patch you up. dinoman's got a head start. i aim to catch up. be warned, raphael. he is possibly the most powerful creature we've ever encountered.  raph's not picking up. maybe he's in trouble. any luck on your end, mikey. nada. the "crognard" fan sites all say that really was the last episode. what a bust. i meant have you found raph. really, though. there wasn't, like, a movie or something after. raphael is searching the sewers for the dinoman. thank you, narrator. whoa. how long can a giant dinosaur stay hidden in a little sewer.    rockwell, what happened. did you say, "dinoman". as in urban legend dinoman from the news. he's no legend. he's real. and he's more powerful than you could ever imagine. alas, we tried to stop raphael from going alone, but that hothead's about to get himself into some hot water.   huh.  what the heck. zog's ready.  the beacon orders must triangulate now. back off, dinoman.  whoa, whoa.  easy, big guy. look, man, i don't want to hurt you, and i'm not sure i can.  mutaters are close.  command.   faster than he looks.   whoa.     aah.  all explosions zero on mission status.  command. orders. i got your orders right here. power to the triceraton empire. destroy the kraang.   you're after the kraang.  well, i got good news for you. we kicked their butts back to dimension x. ah.  captain mozar, orders, now. ah.  orders for the beacon.  orders are stop. on whose authority. uh, me. commander, uh, zoraph in charge. here, now, of you. please don't crush me.    zog reporting for duty, sir.  alert tritroops to kraang. smash them to bits.  uh. . so that actually worked. orders, sir. oh, uh, right. so you think they're out there, soldier. then i order you to find the kraang. zog has the trail as zoraph commands. head down, horns up.  well, this day is getting awesome.     aw, yeah. fixed it. see. now he wins.  it's raph. dude, where are you. we've been calling.   about time. all right, we're here. what's this all about.    aah. yo, hold up. false alarm, zog. holy chalupa. the dinoman's real. and you tamed him. sorta. he likes smashing stuff. isn't that right, soldier.  hold up, raph. did you forget the part where he beat down half the mighty mutanimals. just trust me. i'll explain on the way. go get 'em, soldier. on the way where. the kraang. dude, the kraang are gone. we kicked them back to dimension x, remember. and then we ate pizza and break danced, and i threw up, 'cause no, man. zog says they're still here and he can sniff them out. huh, zog. zog.  zog will lead to kraang. beacon needed.  destruction to the mutaters. you tell them, soldier. old zog's spaceship crashlanded a few months back. he's been taking out the kraang's secret bases ever since. he's on our side. and you trust him. well, we bonded over a mutual love of destruction. what's up, zog. you find something.  what's wrong with him. is he sick. i'm starting to understand his backwards talk. his people, the triceratons, need nitrogen to breathe. and the part where he calls you commander zoraph and does everything you say. hey, i saw a chance to have an attack dino, and i took it. what's the big deal. he needs a leader, and i'm leading.  i don't know about this. well, he's a mostly rational guy. aren't you, zog. stomp the mutaters.  man your battle stations.  the invasion begins. you were saying. you were saying. it is the one called the turtles. whoa, zog was right. the kraang are back. and the one called tritritritritriceraton.  kraang, destroy for kraang. mikey destroys for mikey. hiya. i don't miss these guys but i do miss doing that. biotroids, engage.  me and zog will take these goons. head down, horns up. mutaters.         zoraph will  make your invasion defeat.  to the end.  you tell 'em, zog.    whoa. hey, thanks, big guy. alert the beacon. send the troops. the kraang  have the back door to space. uh, can we come back to that. i'm about to pinpoint kraang's secret hideout. kraang. whoa.  or we could just smash it to pieces and never find out where it is.  ah. and that's for crognard. are your really still mad about the finale. aha. i knew you watched it. watched it. whoa. space hole, dudes. wow, a portal. i wonder where it leads. you know, we should do a test first, just in case it's get in that foxhole, soldier. sir. what. that's what i got him for. good job, zog. he's not an attack dog, raph. he's a deranged alien we know nothing about. what's to know. we hate kraang. zog hates kraang. sweet deal. what do you got, zog.  mutaters are close. there. the statue of liberty is a kraang base. oh no. the kraang are using the statue of liberty as a base. that's just evil. the beacon must  the beacon must go. no choice, rally them. awesome job, sergeant zog. you ready to do this.  whoa, what are they doing.  looks like they're trying to open a portal. and if they bring all those technodromes through, we're all basically doomed. not on our watch. i've got a plan. listen close because we've gotta be precise about it. filthy kraang. horns up.   freeforall it is.  triacera no, no.    kraang. uh  empire to victory. got to admit, he's good with his hands.   zog. we gotta help him. i'm coming, zog. i got a bad feeling whoa.  almost cracked the encryption, and then the kraang can kiss their portal goodbye. hiya. i'll get you out of there, pal. whoa, nice. portable dinosaur. raph, what are you doing. me and zog are gonna take the crown. you guys try and shut the portal down from here. up for the beacon.  the empire will  not be contained.  portal is down. no way they're opening that baby up. i still can't believe dinodude was right about the kraang. and what's this beacon he keeps talking about.  meet us in the crown. zog found his old gear.   at last. i can breathe again. good, 'cause it's time to bounce. all right, fine commander zoraph orders you to bounce.   no signal. need higher ground. raph. what happened. did you get kraanged up. zog found his old equipment and then he turned on me. you were right, leo. it happens to the best of us.  hey, zog. you're not sore about the whole, you know, commander zoraph thing, are you. no. phew. i expect such treachery from the likes of earth. we triceratons pride ourselves on loyalty and honor. you earthdwellers are full of lies and deceit. hey, who you calling "earthdweller". look, man, i'm sorry, but you were kinda being a jerk, and i had to chill you out somehow, and what exactly are you doing with that bomblooking thing. it's not a bomb, it's a signal beacon. phew. to signal the triceraton empire's armada, to come and wipe out this kraanginfested planet.  what.   you can stop the kraang without destroying the planet, you madman.  oh.  zog, think of what our species could learn from each other.  i know all i need to know about your planet. you let the kraang run rampant, jeopardizing the safety of the galaxy. i see no reason to spare you. 'cause we're friends, zog. friends.  we made a good team. we stopped the kraang together. don't do this, man. don't do this to our world. enough.      you fool. i'm sorry i lied to you, zog. but i can't let you invade our world. i'll squash you.  zog. zog, take my hand. long live the triceraton empire. no. no. sorry, raph. but at least we stopped the kraang. and zog's signal, thank goodness. yeah, and on the bright side, we don't have to worry about an invasion of space dinosaurs. i hope not.  sir, we have received the signal beacon. it is deep in subsector 919837 on an unevolved third world planet called earth.  take us to this world, commander.  )
