1  "holy golly willikers, wingnut." "i see him, screwloose." "skullface is a giant." run, old chum, run. haha yeah.  "the adventures of wingnut and screwloose. " these old vintage comics are the best.  wingnut and screwloose aren't bad, but you can't tell me they're better than arachnidman or superb man or even the indelible bulge. eh, none of those even come close to the best comic ever "the fantastic four food groups. " you're kidding me. the "fffg". ooh, talking food. so dark and brooding. hey, that food has real depth and emotion, man.  get on the bus. whoa. hmm i've been having headaches and weird nightmares about space and other galaxies. i don't see anything physically wrong with you, april. you're probably just adjusting to life back on earth. i don't know, donnie. my seventh sense tells me it's not that. it's that freaky crystal she never takes off. hmm. i don't think a crystal could give you headaches, but let me take a look at it. both: aah. no. get away from it. whoa, you're acting like it's your "precious.

"monoculus, let screwloose go, or i'll have no choice but to use my wingnutarang." see. that's monoculus of the planet zoltagg. he's space emperor supreme of all floating eyeballs in the galaxy.   mikey. sensei wants to see us.  looks like comic book fun will have to wait. come on, ice cream kitty.     ugh. maybe the turtles are doing something fun. 'cause the surface is feeling a little boring.   huh.  run.     whoa. what.  giant alien eyeball. from the "wingnut" comics. ha. my day just got wicked awesome. wait till raph sees this.   what the heck is this.  no way.  it can't be. monoculus. hey, eyeball, eat photon puck. aah. great googly oogly.  man, that is one huge eyeball. monoculus. it's so real. just like from the comics. snap out of

weird. huh. is everyone all right. okay, i give up. anyone want to tell me what's going on. i'll tell you what's going on. my comic book came to life. okay. any other theories. it's the emperor supreme of space eyeballs.  it used to be in my comic, but now it's vanished. right. that's why there's no eyeball monster in your comic at all. come on, team. let's head back to the lair. and i want to take a closer look at that crystal, april. i have this comic. they kind of look the same but that's impossible. unless the crystal. the thing the alien dudes gave april. it must have magical powers, yo. it did the scany thing. and then i was all tingly. and then it brought a character from my comic book to life.  whoa. it all makes sense. yeah, sure if you're crazy.    mmm sodium phosphate mm  dimethyl tryptamine april's crystal. it can bring stuff to life. okay, then. make it work, merlin. all right. make wingnut and screwloose come to life, crystal. go for it. do it. umm come on, crystal. stop messing with me. i told you it doesn't work, bromix. no, wait. we got to poke it somehow, give it a zap. like this. aah.  aah.   both: whoa.  whoa, you were right, mikey. holy chalupa. we're back on earth. great galaxies. golly gee willikers, wingnut. whoa. aah. wingnut and screwloose. you guys are my favorite comic book characters ever. huh. well, if it isn't our old foe tortoiseman. escaped from prison again, have we. holy terrifying terrapin. but he's like three feet shorter than tortoiseman, wingnut. obviously another one of tortoiseman's cunning tricks.  wait, wait, wait. i'm not tortoiseman. and i'm not with him. way to have my back, bro.  both: ugh. whoa, these are real wingnutarangs. the second coolest wingnut weapon, behind the wingzooka.   all right, tortoiseman, time to unmask you. mask refuses to come off. aah. holy anthropomorphic amphibians, wingnut. i told you they weren't bad guys. my apologies, citizen. i am wingnut. this is my sidekick, the bug wonder, screwloose. my favorite comic book heroes in real life. and you decided not to peel off my face. wow. oh, i got to get you guys to sign my comic. aw, man. they're gone. this is totally gonna ruin its collectability. name's casey. he's mikey. we're about to go on patrol. any chance you guys want to go look for crime. indeed, young casey. on super hero patrol with wingnut and screwloose. time to look the part. turflytle in the house. buzz, buzz. holy ripoff, wingnut. yes, i know, old chum. but we have more important matters at hand. matters of justice.      huh. what's wrong. ugh. where is my crystal. i gave it back to you. now you've lost it. well, we'll find it, okay. just relax. i don't want to relax. i want my crystal.   april. just leave me alone.   you are not thinking clearly, april. but master splinter, my crystal you are too attached to that object. the crystal is a crutch. i recommend against using it. it's not a crutch. it's just very important to me, and now it's missing. none of us took it, and we're all here except mikey. coast looks clear. buzz, buzz. no sign of any crime. alas, i think i've found some.  skullface mcgillin. criminal mastermind extraordinaire. skullface. dude, he's straight out of the comics. look out. he's aiming his skeletonizer. that's right, see.  booyakasha.  aah.  haha. that's right, see. and you're gonna get zapped by me, see. oh, no, see. aw, yeah. no skeletonizer. what you gonna do now, skully. aah. see. ugh. ugh. ow. ugh, see.  let's share the last punch, together. hahahaa.   ugh see. yo, dog, i get how wingnut and screwloose came out of that comic, but how did skullface escape. no clue, brah. but at least there's no villains left in this issue. let's get something perfectly straight, citizens. we did not come out of any comic book. no. it's true, super dudes. you're just madeup characters. you're from the planet dexion v of the huanu system. wingnut lost his family at the intergalactic movies, and later adopted screwloose after a tragedy at the space circus.  how how do you know so much about us. are you working for captain confusion. it was the power of the crystal, yo. see. an you feel it, old chum. it's the source the source of life and power itself. whoa. are you guys feeling okay. give us the crystal. huh. life and power and it's ours.   no.  i swear, if mikey lost my crystal  mikey. where the heck are you. dude. me and casey need help.  wingnut and screwloose have gone all evil. we're tracking them across the city right now. did i mention they're evil. you're tracking comic book characters across the city. and it's finally happened. mikey's lost his mind. wingnut and screwloose are real, dude. they came from april's crystal. but don't tell april i took her crystal. or that i lost her crystal. or that the bad guys have her crystal. cool. mikey. my crystal. my bad. raph, get everybody to the old cathedral. fast. they're in their bell tower lair straight out of the comics.  dude, check it out, brah.  whoa. whoa, this is from "wingnut and screwloose" no. 30. and this is the squirrel from issue 35. cool. look, it's all their costumes.  the crystal is a conduit of energy. it created us, old chum. i get it now, wingnut. we don't really exist in this world. we're just images brought to life. it's a big bummer. what can we do. the crystal can sustain us. we can survive with its power. we can become more real than the beings in this world. i just have to discover how to tap its mystical energy. do we make our move. not yet. wait till the time is aah.  intruders. they're after the crystal.   come on, wingnut. we don't want to hurt you. you're not bad guys. you're heroes. lies. you'll say anything to get the crystal. aah. whoa. got you, casey.    whoa, mikey was right. we got to start listening to him more often. i'll destroy you, vile turtle.  ugh.   aah. aah.   aah. hold on, raph. i got your back.  this kind of thing would never happen with the "fantastic four food groups. "  what's wrong with you, wingnut. in the comics, you're a hero. i still am. he's got my crystal. it's mine.    huh. casey, i've got an idea. it's not great, but it's an idea. just do it already.   this is as close as i can get. now, april, focus your powers.  ugh. no.  now reabsorb the energy that brought them to life. finally back where she belongs. golly. did you hear that, wingnut. they're gonna send us back to being pictures on a page. no, old chum, they're going to send us back to where we're supposed to be. i'm sorry for the all the trouble we've caused here, tortoise allies. we don't belong here.  sorry everything got so messed up, wingnut. thanks for coming on patrol with us. anytime, old chum.   holy goodbyes, everyone.   don't be sad, mikey. they were never real to begin with.  i know. it's cool, bro.  april, when we get back to the lair, i think i'd better run some more tests on that crystal. no, donnie. april, are you all right. it's my crystal. i'm never gonna take it off again for anyone or anything ever again. )
