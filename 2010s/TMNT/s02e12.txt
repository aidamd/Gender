really use your help, sensei. last time you took that creep down with one punch. last time was different, leonardo. the rat king has grown too powerful. i do not fear for myself, but for what he could force me to do.  the human species is coming to an end. it is time to advance the next phase of evolution. rodents shall rule.  what.  why do i have to wear the cheese. we have to lead them away, and you're awesome at being bait. ah. this is the worst thing ever.  waaah. faster, faster, faster. sorry i'm late. aah. revel in the madness, my brother. there is room for you in my new world. no. get

welcome, esteemed guests. there's no need to fear. i will not hurt you. that i promise. let us out of here, you freak. all in good time. these were simple, ordinary rats. until i transformed them. with my special mutagenic growth serum. but these were not the soldiers i was looking for. i have just unlocked. the secrets of the ultimate army. rat people. and you, my friends, will become that army.   oh.  the rat king peered into my mind. to see what makes me unique. with that knowledge, he will create. an army of rat people. we got to stop him, sensei. i told you, he is too powerful even for me. but, master splinter, if there's one time we could use your help, it's now. enough. i will not put you in danger again. we believe in you, sensei. we need your help and so does casey.  are you ready for the most dangerous, crucial mission of your life.  aw, kitty. then let's do this.  that's right, aristotle. every time one of my rat people bites a human, they will infect them, causing the mutation to spread. and spread until every human being. in this wretched world transforms into one of us.  what's that you say. the serum's not perfected. what do you mean.  cheese. give me cheese. well, not every experiment can be a success. but this new serum will work. perhaps we should test it.  you're right, aristotle. she is the perfect test subject.    there's casey. he's alive. and irma. we can't let the humans see us, april. you have to free 'em. sensei. it is time the rat king is dethroned. i knew you wouldn't let us down. if i should lose control, you do what you have to do. nothing's gonna happen 'cause i got my supersecret weapon. yeah. let's go.  huh.  no. get out. you're mine now, splinter. destroy your sons ah. one by one.  forget that, rat king. oh, yeah. ice cream

the rats.  but what about sensei.    hiyah.  that's right. bow before your master, rat. there's nothing you can do that i can't see coming. so you still think you are in control of the situation.  aristotle.  you'll pay for that. i can still see through your eyes. what. how about now.  control is an illusion.  where  are you. ah. aah. it can be even more blinding than the inability to see. it can ah.  send you over the edge. goodbye, my king. )
