crystal. no. i'm not taking it off. don't even ask again, donnie. it's safe, as long as i have it. hmm. if i can replicate how this crystal increases your powers, that could provide a frame of reference increase her powers. don't worry. only slightly. by maybe . 3%.    april, let me know if you feel anything. okay. tingling, headache  i told you, i'm fine. just leave the crystal  ahh.  gah.

are you going.   sensei.  i will be fine. april. i should never have tried testing that crystal. she possesses a power i have never seen before, but it is not your doing. i fear she can no longer control it. i have to get that necklace away from her and destroy it. somehow. please, be careful, my son. that being was not april. i can get through to her, sensei. i know i can.    aw, nuts. still beat me.  mm. what's happening to you. i thought donnie and splinter were looking after you. i guess. i don't remember. ah.  it's that crystal. it has some seriously bad juju, dudes. it's changing you, april.  there is no april only zanaron.    what do you mean, you're not april. who is zanaron. i am the soul of an elder aeon, one of the first seven. after 100 millennia our physical forms had disintegrated, so our spirits were each placed into the soul star, to exist forever. i have been transplanting my mind into her consciousness slowly. but the aeons did not know how corrupt this planet could be. i intend to save it. wha. ahh.   donnie. april. foolish mortal.  stay out of my way.  april, it's me, donatello. donnie. ahh.  listen to me. give me the crystal. just give me the crystal and everything will be okay. no. ah. donnie. donnie. donnie.   this isn't you, april. that crystal is changing you. you need to break free. ah. it's too much power. ii can't control it anymore.  you can do it. i know you can. i'm not strong enough. donnie, i'm sorry. april. please.   april. please.   donnie. donnie. oh, my gosh. no.          she's gone. what do we do, leo. what just happened. is donnie gone.  poor donnie.     ah. no. donnie. i can't believe it. how could i. you made your choice, and you chose the crystal. let go of your connection to these sublife forms who pollute this planet. i must cleanse it, starting with this city.  this is dragon territory, grandma. if you wish our protection      come to play, girl.   impressive tricks. ever think of joining the purple dragons.  no. wha.   you can't do this, april. or zanaron, or whoever you are. do not stand in my way, or you will be cleansed just as donatello was.  we have to stop her. well, what if april is still in there. are you kidding. i don't like it, but april o'neil is gone. we have no choice. we take her down.   do it. hurry. i can't hurt her, dude. ahh.       we know you're in there, red. we're your friends. your family. remember who you are. you are april o'neil. remember everything we've been through together. yeah, like the time we fought a giant mutagen man. and our dope missions in space. and master splinter. and pizza parties. and ice cream kitty.   no. ahh.   wha.  ahh. remember donnie.  we don't the power to destroy the crystal. only you do, april.     ahh.  foolish creature.  you could have had all the power of the universe.   no.  red, is that really you. i think so. but but donnie. what have i done. it's not your fault, april. but it is. it was all me in a way. if only  donnie's not gone. he wasn't really destroyed, just molecularly scattered.  yeah. bro. donnie. thank goodness.  april. april. april.   i'm so sorry. i guess i should have listened to you about the crystal. especially you, donnie. i'm sorry for for what. reducing me to a quantum smear. yeah, still feel kind of whacked out of my head, but i'll be fine. i am impressed, april. you literally destroyed your demons. she almost destroyed all of us. what about your powers. they were always part of me. i can't harness the power of the aeons anymore, but i think i know how to control my powers better. whoa. ah. so at least some good came out of this. )
