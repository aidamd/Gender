oh. ah. i give you the new and improved metalhead. whoa. i've been upgrading his artificial intelligence. so he'll be the perfect training tool. you sure. training with metalhead. usually ends in him breaking something. waaah. i've programmed him to simulate dozens. of fighting styles, including the foot and the kraang. pssh, can't simulate my fighting style. let's just go already. wah. ooh. get it off. ya me. can i get off the ride now. donatello. metalhead stop training program. oh. i think he put my chin on my nose. i'm sorry, sensei, but overall, i'd say that was a pretty successful test. successful. metalhead almost ripped mikey's face off. please. i had it all under control. and when you don't. donatello has created a powerful tool. it is to our advantage to study an enemy's techniques. but you must use that tool wisely. what's wrong with him now. something tripped the security wires. it's approaching the lair fast. do you think it's footbots again. ow. was that nah, couldn't be. spider bytez. teenage mutant ninja turtles teenage mutant ninja turtles teenage mutant ninja turtles heroes in a half shell, turtle power here we go, it's a lean, green, ninja team on the scene, cool teens doing ninja things so extreme, out the sewer like laser beams get rocked with the shellshocked pizza kings can't stop these radical dudes the secret of the ooze made the chosen few emerge from the shadows to make their move the good guys win, and the bad guys lose leonardo's the leader in blue does anything it takes to get his ninjas through donatello is the fella who has a way with machines raphael's got the most attitude on the team michelangelo he's one of a kind, and you know just where to find him when it's party time master splinter taught 'em every single skill they need to be one lean, mean, green incredible team teenage mutant ninja turtles teenage mutant ninja turtles teenage mutant ninja turtles heroes in a half shell, turtle power you frogs got to help. those foreign triplets are after me. we are not frogs. wait. what. they're heading for the surface. help. you can't do this to me. i want my phone call. i got rights as a spider. help. help. they're getting away. why is that our problem. that slobbering bug gives us nothing but trouble. he asked for our help. the kraang want him, and i want to find out why. fine. so how are we supposed to catch up i called for backup. nice, donnie. when did you teach him how to drive. ah. you did teach him how to drive, didn't you. huh. that's new. evasive maneuvers. deploy garbage cannon. what are you ow. hey. yeah. garbage beats kraang rocket. pull up alongside. now we're talking. this bug better be worth it. a little help. whoa. gotcha. get me out of here. oh. watch out. there's no way out of there. metalhead, stay with the shellraiser. before you blow anything else up. he stopped the truck, didn't he. the kraang know we're coming. he can help. ugh. whatever. aah. what. huh. they just disappeared. that's impossible. there must be a secret door. or a hidden passage somewhere. fan out. hmm. hmm. mm. ha. oh, yeah. well, how about now. well, okay, then. you win this round. metalhead, use your scanners to check the structure. for any hidden rooms or passageways. it tickles. tickle ray. real useful upgrade, donnie. it happens to be. a threedimensional volumetric scan. but that doesn't make sense. there should be tire marks or a seam in the floor, but the kraang left no trace at all, just some junk and super macho burrito. whoo, yes. it's the ultimate combination of pizza and burrito pizzarito. it's super and macho. i'm going in. do you have any idea how long that's been in there. who cares. super and macho. lengua y queso. your arm's stuck, isn't it. possibly. maybe on purpose. whoa. it's like a vending machine from the future. a kraang computer. mikey, you're a genius. that's how i roll. can that computer tell us where the kraang went. metalhead, see if you can access its database. it should tell us where they disappeared to. uh, are you sure plugging metalhead. into unknown kraang tech is a good idea. trust me, leo, the kraang processor in metalhead. makes him perfectly compatible with their computers. what could go wrong. great, donnie. great. not only did we lose the kraang, but metalhead blew up our only clue to where they went. even worse, he blew up my super macho burrito. it must've been some kind of energy surge. you okay, little buddy. oh, no. oh. seems fine to me. oh. gah. can we go home now, please. what about the kraang. what about 'em. spider bytez is their problem now. but what did they want with him. metalhead's memory core isn't too badly damaged. stop it, mikey. it seems that the kraang security algorithms. were too complex to decrypt. less sciencey, more englishy. i should be able to retrieve. what he downloaded from the kraang computer. mikey. ow. he might take a little time to fix, though. how long. well, in technical terms a while. duck. whoa. we know the kraang rebuilt tcri. what if they got the portal working again. that's what we need to find out. ah. how's it going, donnie. not bad. okay, donnie. it's late. give it a rest. i've almost got it. just working out the bugs. whoa. donnie. you got to shut down his a. i. shut down his a. i. . but that would be like turning off his brain. he's just too dangerous. we need him, leo. the kraang and the foot are armed up more than ever. it's not worth the risk. metalhead was glitchy before he plugged. into that kraang computer. he was taken over by the kraang once already. are you sure you can trust him. maybe you're right. i'll take care of it. sorry, donnie. whoa. okay, buddy, let's fix you up. just a little reboot, wipe your memory, and you'll be all better. this won't hurt a bit. donnie, what are you doing. yeah, dude, you know better. than to go algae diving without a spotter. ah. locked. open this door, you oversized toaster. what about the garage door. no good. he welded it shut. donnie, i told you he was dangerous. now he's probably out there trashing the city. well, i'll fix it. we just got to get out of here. help. help. somebody. killer robot on the loose. what are you doing. you don't want splinter to do you boys have any idea what time it is. uh, pizza time. why was the door locked. ah, you know just messing around. no reason. metalhead tried to kill us. leonardo. the truth is, sensei, we got to meet april at murakami's big mutant sushi problem. we'll be back before dawn. don't wait up for us. teenagers. should we just follow the cries of terror or metalhead couldn't have gotten far. if his tracking device is still active let's see, hmm. oh, there. make a left at the next block. there he is. over here. going into a portapotty. maybe he has to change his oil. wait. i saw this on a magic show. there's a secret door down here. hello. definitely not a secret door. i think i'm gonna hurl. what was that. i don't understand. it it was just um, tada. what. how did you do that. i just got the touch. l. t. d. like a turtle do. it's some kind of dimensional gateway, like like the kraang portal. this must be how they disappeared. hmm. i wonder if whoa. guys. donnie. guys. booyakasha. the portal it's closing. no turning back now. so is this dimension "x". if it was, we probably wouldn't be able to breathe. my guess is not dimension "x. " got it. guys. i found where they took spider bytez. hey, fellas. can we talk about this. i know bugs in high places. i could wait till i get out of here. spike. i'm gonna break every tentacle on your pink aah. it looks like a prison. snakeweed. dr. rockwell. oh, no. mr. o'neil we got to get him out of here. uh, guys. metalhead. is he working for the kraang. dude, i knew something didn't feel right. when he grabbed my face. he came here to free the mutants. all along, we thought he was going crazy, but he's here just to save 'em. guys. we got company. we got to help him. donnie, wait. kraang, release the mutant captives. that are controlled by kraang. the ones that are turtles that i call frogs. must be destroyed. is it me, or is spider bytez. a lot less spider bytez and a lot more kraangy. ah. whoa. waaah. aah. exterminate all mutants. so what do we do, fearless leader. i'm open to suggestions. the device that is the control device. is no longer controlling. frogs, are you getting me out of here, or do i got to do it myself. metalhead, see if you can open a portal. we're getting out of here. right. all of us mutants too. metalhead did it. he opened the portal. my turn. keep me prisoner. huh. hmm. every spider for himself. the machine that opened the portal. must close the portal. metalhead, you got to keep the portal open. let's get out of here. mr. o'neil. fly out of here, please. for april. go. now. metalhead, we're leaving. come on, you tin can. move. he has to keep it open for us. but what about him. we don't have a choice. metalhead. metalhead. oh, no. dude, he saved us. he saved all of us. you're right, donnie. i should've trusted you. i programmed him to be intelligent, but i didn't realize how much he had evolved. donnie, i'm sorry about metalhead, bro. i didn't really mind it when he grabbed my face. his hands were soft for a robot. thanks, mikey. do you think you'll try building another metalhead. maybe i will one day. )
