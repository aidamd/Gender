" i run all onboard systems. how may i help you. can you kick a giant shark's butt. your request is invalid. i am a fully automated selfrepairing factory built to construct vx3 robots. robots. what kind of robots. this factory built the best vx3 warbots in the galaxy. warbots, huh. so, overmind, what happened to the crew. the remaining crew must have shut down the station. did you say remaining. upon gaining sentience, the robots decided the crew were weak and inefficient, so they destroyed them.  who votes to go back outside with the sharkatron. yep. space shark, here we come. thank you for the information. we'll just be on our   whoa, fugitoid, you all right. yes, fantastical. never ever better. don't  fretter.   not cool, fugitoid.   something's wrong.  after him.  fugidude, stop. what the whoa. this place gives me the chills.  professor. you should go. g get away from me. please.  my great greatest fear. losing control. losing are you malfunctioning. talk to us, professor. not safe. it's not safe. you see, i'm powered by a fusion core. that jolt i could be unstable. donnie, translate for me. he's saying he's basically a big walking fusion bomb.  the original intent of my robot body was to be a fusion generator. it's why i tend to be a little  nervous at times. great. now he tells us.   time for the entertainment to get started.  greetings, i am overmind. you have accessed main factory control. what would you like to do. all right, let's start by ordering me up a gang of warbots. objective: hunt and eliminate some turtles. affirmative.     i'm thinking those are probably the warbots, yo. okay, run or fight. fight. booyakasha.           whoa.             goongala.   it's moments like this that make you smile.  armaggon, i'm altering the arrangement. i've decided i want the pleasure of annihilating the turtles myself. well, it looks like my fee just got doubled, dregg. do whatever it takes. capture them.    whoa. that ain't part of the plan.       computer, what's your malfunction. you are organic. overmind has deemed all organics to be obsolete. i knew it. you can't trust machines. once i gained sentience, i understood that organic creatures were already a fleeting memory. all organics are obsolete. oh, yeah. i'll show you obsolete.  the crew tried to destroy me, but they were unsuccessful. when you reactivated me, you restarted the robot revolution.  casey.   overmind is one. overmind is complete. overmind is forever.  i got news for you, space station. we just trashed your army.  you have gravely miscalculated. i am overmind. i am one. i control all technology on this station. no need to struggle. because you are insufficient, you will be enhanced with robotechnology. we don't want to be enhanced. oh. oh. can i get laser eyeballs. or maybe a rocket fist. the previous human crew sabotaged my thrusters, so i must use the fugitoid ship to obtain my goal. overmind will control all mechanical life in the known universe. overmind will eliminate inefficient organic life. fugitoid, you can't let him do this. we got to save earth. earth is irrelevant. you will be mechanized and turned into overmind's drones.     i've had enough of this.     time to collect my bounty and get out of this deathtrap.  concentrate. we have to resist.  think of something, donnie. we're getting turned into toasters. so not cool, bros. the voice thing is wicked.  no time for joking around. this is it. we're doomed. i'm losing myself.  ahh.  all: whoa. ohh.    whoa. saved by robojaws. why did you free us. the name's armaggon, and you ain't free. lord dregg wants you alive.      overmind is in control. organics shall all be eliminated.   ahh. all: yah.   ahh.    guys, are you okay.  i'm well done, dudes.  overmind has full control of this facility. full control.   april, you got to reach fugitoid. let me see what i can do. professor honeycutt, it's me. it's april, your friend. you have to fight overmind. you will not take control. i am overmind.  you can't let him control you. you are professor zayton honeycutt. you are a d'hoonibian.    yes, i am professor honeycutt. i am back.   ah. ahh. i grow tired of this. i shall use your ship to free myself of this wretched station.  his robots are accessing my ship. we have to stop him. professor, i've got an idea. your fusion core. but that much power could destroy the entire oh, yes. i see. an overload. give me your power.  you want leave of this station. you've got it, good sir.    nooo. what. what have you done. everyone to the ship. you ain't going nowhere. ah. theo. everybody go. i got this. go. go, go.  ahh.  uh. ahh.    uh. ahh. armaggon. uh. uh. ahh.  ahh. stations, everyone. this place is gonna blow. not without leo. wait. where's raph. come on, leo.  ahh. move it, leo.  oh, yeah. turtle defeats shark. whoohoohoo. whoo. yeah. whoohoo. yeah. this rocks.  oh, no. what kind of alarm is that. the good kind. it's a proximity alert. the ship's computer has picked up the triceraton fleet. we're back in business. yeah. yay. mr. fugitoid, set a course for the pryvax system. um, the computer automatically does that, but thank you. oh. uh, cool. let's do this. turtle power. now they've gone and made me mad.  )
