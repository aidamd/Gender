yeah, shellax, dude. is that any way to talk to the guy you begged to be leader. ha. is that what he told you. he's so clumsy he nearly destroyed our sacred tree. we demanded punishment, but he ran off like an itty witty wittle baby. get that turtle out of here. ugh, that's rasputin, the mad frog. turtles are not to be trusted. why have a shell except to hide things, yes. secrets, yes. his shell is obviously protection from samurai attacks. duh. and look. he wears a mask to hide his true identity. my identity is: i'm michelangelo, the cute one. i'm 15, love pizza, ice cream, kittens made of ice cream, ninjitsu tell me, michelangelo. why do you have no home. i was stuck living in that farmhouse on the edge of the woods with my brothers and some humans. ah. with humans. humans. ick. yuck. yeah. but i can't go back because of course you can't go back. you're free now. free from the tyranny of your masters. stay among us, my mutant brother. yes. in your face, rasputin.  humans again. they still have the turtle's poor brothers in their terrible clutches. you know what to do, genghis. sir, yes, sir. operation liberate reptiles. frogs. hop. hop. hop. mikey's nowhere. i don't get it. aw, no. what happened. somebody trashed the place. it couldn't have been mikey. no. not even on his worst day. and why would he write "humans beware." look. footprints. weird footprints. yeah. and more over here pretty far apart. like they jumped. there's more over here. ah, guys, i got a bad feeling about this. now is the time, my brothers. frogs. attack.  take shelter. fall back to the farmhouse. guys, what is going on. repulsive humans. hear me. is he talking to us. obviously not me. free our brothers. the human reign of terror in these woods ends tonight. uh, these humans didn't kidnap us. what. are they forcing you to say that. um, no. we're actually pretty good friends with these humans. friends. with humans. then you are traitors. frogs. show the humans and turtles no mercy. great. i was tired of that conversation anyway. wah. oh man. frogapults. launch. look out. they're everywhere. there's too many of them. ow. hey hey hey. get off of him, jerk. let me go, punk. let me go.  they took april and casey. come on. we can follow their tracks. okay, okay just gimme a minute. so, in this new york place, you guys beat whole legions of feet soldiers. foot soldiers, yeah. raph, that's my brother, raphael, he's all, "rah." with his sai. and my other brother donny hacks the bad guys' computers he's smart like that. and leo he's our fearless leader. heh, not me dude. your brothers sound awesome. yeah, they are. even after i trash the house. my brothers just pick on me. sorry i wasn't entirely, totally true back there.  it's all good, napoleon. let go of me, creep. silence, human. that sounded like april. ah. gah. help. hey. what is this. what are you doing to my friends. friends. you said these humans were terrible to you. you escaped. oh. ha. that's not exactly what i meant. see this human lover lied to become accepted by us. live with humans, suffer with humans. ah. hey. let me go. no. he's my friend, you can't. i told you never to trust a turtle. that turtle is a traitor. your mom is a traitor. science teaches us that humans are inferior. to disagree is heresy, napoleon. idiots. ah. why can't we all just get along. why. you dare to ask why. there was once a time when we, the amphibians, ruled these lands. we frolicked in the woods and the trees and the swamplands. until they, the humans, arrived, with their metal monsters. they needed more strip malls. more gas stations. more coffee shops. and one day these woods will disappear as well. there will be nothing. fortunately, rasputin discovered a gift in a puddle below this tree. the sacred ooze.  mutagen. the time for revolution is now. we shall invade their cities. with this "mutagen" we will create a bigger family. the age of humans is at an end. we shall rise.  you gotta listen. you can't do that. frog soldiers. assemble. all: frogs rule. frogs rule. frogs rule. frogs rule. frogs rule. frog soldiers. these lives will once again be ours. here's the plan. we wait for the army to leave, free the guys, then stop the invasion. perfect. not so perfect. wahow. heh. awkward. genghis. destroy him. eat it, froggy. guys. yes. go ninjas. little help, guys. wah. ah. get us outta here, napoleon. i gotta totally go ninja on their butts. sometimes, a frog's gotta do what a frog's gotta do. whoa. ugh. where do you think you're going, napoleon. i think i'm going ninja on your butt. sweet ninja moves, napoleon. i learned them from the second best warrior i know.  get off of me, punks. rah. goodbye, traitor. hiya. mikey. what are you doing, dude. hugging, i think. it's weird. yeah. let's never do that again. wah.  oh no. fire. fire. the tree is on fire. we must totally flee. wah. ooh. napoleon's right. run. come on, everyone. this way. do not flee, my frogs. stand and fight against the humans and their allies don't take this the wrong way, attila buddy.  come on, red. let's blow this flaming tree house. everyone hurry. flee. our home. what. humans. saving me. not all humans are bad. and i'd like to believe not all mutated frogs are bad, attila.  the horror. the horror. my frogs. to me. attila the frog has never been wrong about anything in his life. but perhaps i have been a bit hasty about these humans. frogs, line up behind your general. huh. what the heck is going on here. you, napoleon, were the only frog to show wisdom regarding these turtles and humans. you are brave, stalwart, and have a good heart. and so i promote you to general. this is pretty much the best position ever. stupid bugeyed kid is general. what was that, genghis. uh, nothing, sir. perhaps there is a future where frogs, turtles, and revolting humans can live together in harmony. what about your home. where you gonna go. down south. we have like i got you some delicious flies. aw. ew. let me see if i have something for you. ooh. nice and warm. mm. mm, thanks. frogs, march. hoptwothreefour goodbye, michelangelo. see ya. goodbye, napoleon. there goes one brave frog. you know what. it's good to have you back, bro. it's good to be back, bros. let's go home. we have a lot of cleaning up to do. )
