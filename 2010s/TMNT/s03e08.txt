" all true ninjas must master it. hey, who says i'm not spiritually refine  ed. whoa. heh. must have been  okay, you win.  let's get refined.   aah.      aah. it's happening. aah. oh.  whoa. guys, look. it was the same deer. i think it's been following us. it's probably laughing at the four dumb turtles lost in the woods. actually, in the shinto religion, deer are considered messengers of the divine.  maybe it means we're on the right path. all: mutant. no, wait. it's not a mutant.  oh. ooh. yah. whooah. ooh. guys, stop. whaah. huh. ohh. huh. ooh.    stop.  i said stop. oh.  whoa, dudes.

us help you. you cannot yet. there is much you must overcome. if you cannot find your inner, spiritual strength, you will not stand a chance against the shredder. but master splinter, my leg injury, itit's physical. until i heal we choose what holds us back and what moves us forward. you will all learn this. each of you must journey out alone to face your spiritual adversary. raphael, your temper is like a fire that you must learn to focus for power. michelangelo, your mind is overrun with distractions. learn to be strong and calm, like the forest. donatello, you rely too much on your mind, and not on your body. be strong, like the mountain. leonardo. you must be the leader in body and spirit. be like the wind. let nothing weigh you down. sleep now, my sons. for your greatest trail awaits on the spiritual plane. for the challenges you face there will be just as deadly as those you face in the real world.  be warned.  whoa, that was deep. master splinter made our quest clear. it's time we begin, ninjas.  each of us will forge new armor and weapons, then journey on alone, where we'll be challenged in the spirit realm, the place where the unreal become real, and we meet our ultimate fate.   mikey, stay focused. remember what master splinter said. the things we're gonna fight are just as dangerous as shredder.  hope you like pizza, you lucky magic deer. hm. it's time. good luck, everyone. kentou o. all: kentou o.   oh. wait.  wait.   oh.  a foot soldier. was it real.    okay, not cool. definitely not cool. so much for finding a hidden pirate ship. waste of time.

that temper fizzles fast under water, doesn't it. aah. wah.  you want to bring half the mountain down.  fine with me. ha. hey, this seishin syuyou is way easier than i thought.  all it takes is a little quick thinking and. . oh. we're just getting started. let's see how quick your thinking is when i smash your head into the rocks. tiger claw. no, you're just a spirit, too.  you can't be real.  does that feel real to you. absolutely. what is it. what is your lesson.  lesson. you've already failed. the shredder. you are too weak to stand without your master. heyah.   you can hardly stand at all.  aah. aahhaho. oh. hey. pause, pause. oh. give me a second, spirit dude. heeyah. hoh. aah.      heeyah.  oh.     okay, mikey. what did master splinter say. be still and calm like the forest.  not

twice your size and three times your strength. you will fall.  be strong, like the mountain.  aah. aah.  breathe, raph. splinter is right. i need to concentrate and focus my anger. sharpen it. give it form.  ready for another swim. i bet your toys don't work so well under water. aah. eh. ha. eat it.  your wounded leg is like a balland chain, dragging you toward defeat.    shredder is right. my injury is always gonna hold me back. i can't win.    unless the pain is just in my mind. it's just an excuse. it's not real.     it is time we end this, turtle. i agree. aah. hey.   i beat you on the spirit plane, and one day, i'll beat you in the real world. i'm ready. if you knock me into the mud one more time, red oh. what are you gonna do about it.  hiyah. finally. yes.  whoo.  what. nothing
