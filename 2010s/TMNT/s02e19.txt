will set her free. just give her the time she needs to accept who she is. right. look, leo, she'll come around. yeah, well, personally, i hope she doesn't. i don't trust her, not for one second. you're right, raph. you shouldn't trust anyone. ah. huh. mmm. ohh. oh. having a hard time keeping up, girl. i was taking it easy on you since you're working with only one eye and no tail. you think you're clever. you're a fool. i'm the fool. you've faced the turtles in battle before and lost. what exactly is your grand plan for revenge here. to destroy warriors such as these, you don't strike at their limbs, you go for their heart. and what does an overgrown cat know of the heart. why do you think the shredder sent you with me. because i know them. i know the places they go. i know their weakness. their friends april o'neil and casey jones. the riders of the worm. they will all pay for what they did to me. hello. is somebody there. leonardo. not quite. the turtles. i don't know what you're talking about. lying will only make this worse. leonardo, raphael, michelangelo, and donatello. where do they live. i don't know. please, please. there is no honor in this. i didn't come here for honor. guys, stop. what is it, mikey. i feel like we're forgetting something. something important. something something the fate of the world could depend on. it's right on the tip of my tongue. the kraang. no. the foot clan. no. the rat king. no. wait. i remember. my doggy bag. the leftover gyoza are back at mr. murakami's. we have to go back. fate of the world. what happened. mr. murakami. mr. murakami, it's me, mikey. are you okay. they came looking for you. they wanted to know where you lived. but i didn't know. they asked about your friends. to my shame, i told them everything i knew. who did this. the girl and the growling man. tiger claw is back. and he's going after april and casey. we have to get to april and casey, you know, time permitting. the girl has got to be karai, leo. i told you not now, raph. april's not answering her tphone. she always answers. we'll split up. me and donny will go to april's place, you and mikey get to the ice rink and warn casey. why wouldn't she answer her phone. best movie ever. the part where the captain is cornered by the monster, and it's all slobber and fangs and goo, and then boom, that explosion knocked them out of orbit and and they're falling into the star and and and i just don't get why our date had a third wheel attached to it. hello. i'm right here. that's the problem. who said anything about this being a what is it. we're being followed. what. all right, whatever it is, we split up and lead it away from the third wheel here. plan. plan. guys, am i missing something. well, that's just great. yes. coast is clear. casey jones can't be caught. aww, nuts. come on, tiger dude. let's see what you got. you know what. on second thought, i don't need to see what you've got. she's not answering. she always answers. that's what i said. kirby, you said she went to the movies. that's where we start. o'neil. you want to do this, karai. fine. but i'm warning you, i've been training with master splinter big time, and i'm ready to kick your butt. i didn't come to fight. i came to talk. oh, well i've been trained in that too. whoa. you know, part of me always wanted to fight a maneating tiger. know any real ones. do you think this is a game. whoa. yeah, keep away from oneeyed freaks. or we could play a game of crush the cat. later. yeah. woo. if it wasn't for the fact that i'm gonna die, this would be so cool. all my life, i was raised to believe that the shredder was my father. that splinter was the enemy. so when leo told me that splinter was my true father, i couldn't accept it. but then i began to have doubts about shredder's honor. doubts about the evil leader of the evil ninja clan. really. yes, even now, the shredder has sent tiger claw to destroy the turtles. he's trying to use me to set a trap for them. but i can't even if it means betraying shredder. taste exploding puck. okay, catmandude, you wanna do this. let's do this. ah. whoa. you will pay for what you did to me, the suffering you caused, the pain i endured. you're not still mad about the whole worm thing, are you. casey. casey. casey, answer me. something's wrong, mikey. what are we gonna do. i know exactly what to do. we can use our phones to triangulate the position of casey's tphone by bouncing the locator signal off the satellite. that's actually a good idea. it's like we're in some kind of alternate universe or something. you can also track pizza delivery guys that way. booyakasha. there's april. come on. get away from her. leo, donny, wait. you have to listen to what she has to say. i believe you, leonardo. i believe that splinter is my true father. i believe that she believes you. i believe april. this this is great. i knew you'd come around. we'll take you to the lair to see master splinter. whew. raph's not gonna believe this. i don't believe this. what have you guys done. casey. what world do you live in that it's okay to bring the princess of the foot clan to out secret lair. what happened to casey. tiger claw threw him off a building. and you just brought his partner in crime home for dinner. shredder lied to me. i didn't know. did you know that i'm about to stick this sai right up your raph, no. she understands now. she gets it. she knows the truth, raph. everything's gonna be fine. will you just listen. i've heard enough from you and your girlfriend. she's probably leading the shredder here right now. enough. miwa. splinter. come with me. i retain very little from my old life, but this i will never let go my daughter. ii can't believe it. you're telling the truth. all these years, the shredder has been lying to me. wait, you can't believe it. i thought you did believe it. if you didn't believe it, why did you come down here. father what have i done. reptiles where are you. underground, in the sewers. you had to see with your own eyes. you had to learn the truth for yourself. you knew. you knew i was lying. no doubt the shredder's forces are on their way. what was that last part. tiger claw is tracking me. i told you. karai. there's no time to argue. i have to get out of here. i can i can lead tiger claw away. go, take karai and watch over her. i will stay with april and attend to casey. you are who you choose to be, not what others make you. some of us choose to be right all the time. will you just go. do you think he's gonna be okay. april why did you have to bring irma again. she's so nasty. well, princess. you got us into this. where to. i i don't know. everyone, stop. i know exactly where to go. i feel scared. i can't smell you, but i can hear you. show yourselves. they're stalking me. oof. are you afraid to face me. ah. are you afraid to fight me. let us finish this. ha. wah. ah. ungh. whoa. ugh. ha. karai, would you like the honor of finishing him. i have no honor. but that's about to change. if you value her life, do not take another step. just as i thought. no. come on, we have to wow, i think his shell was knocked loose. we have to get him back to master splinter. karai. i still don't trust her. are you kidding. she saved us. the shredder raised her. daddy's probably welcoming her home right now. she has betrayed you, master shredder. she fought alongside the turtles. tell me the truth. splinter is my father, isn't he. yes. hamato yoshi is your true father. what. tiger claw, take her away. no. no. no. what are you doing. nooo. )
