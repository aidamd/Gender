2x17 newtralized kraang must evade those that pursue kraang. move it, casey. you think i'm on a midnight stroll. ah. hang on. they're getting away with the plutonium. can't lose 'em. aw, crud. are you pulling my sai. let's go. i think i lost another tooth. what the. who could've done this. and it keeps getting worse. they took the plutonium. what do you think they need it for. no idea. but whoever it was, packed some serious firepower. let's just hope they're on our side. teenage mutant ninja turtles teenage mutant ninja turtles teenage mutant ninja turtles heroes in a half shell, turtle power here we go it's a lean, green, ninja team on the scene cool teens doing ninja things so extreme, out the sewer like laser beams get rocked with the shellshocked pizza kings can't stop these radical dudes the secret of the ooze made the chosen few emerge from the shadows to make their move the good guys win, and the bad guys lose leonardo's the leader in blue does anything it takes to get his ninjas through donatello is the fellow who has a way with machines raphael's got the most attitude on the team michelangelo, he's one of a kind, and you know just where to find him when it's party time master splinter taught 'em every single skill they need to be one lean, mean, green, incredible team teenage mutant ninja turtles teenage mutant ninja turtles teenage mutant ninja turtles heroes in a half shell, turtle power uhhuh. that's where i want it. that's where i want it. mm. aw, yeah. about to hit the high score. oh, yeah, we're gonna do this. great use of your time. aw. while somebody else is out there busting the kraang's brains in. and that somebody wasn't us. we got other vigilantes out there going after those alien blobs. sounds good to me. less work for us. it's not good. the kraang stole plutonium. and whoever took 'em down stole it from them. interesting. maybe shredder's going after the kraang again. i don't think these were shredder's guys. ha. i know exactly who's behind this. you better not say squirrels with lasers again. so what do we do, leo. hunt down whoever's hunting the kraang. i think we better blanket the area, keep an eye out. raph and casey, stick to the alleyways. donnie and mikey, you take the rooftops. i'll cover the sewers. we'll meet back at the lair at midnight. you think you can keep up this time, jones. what is your problem, raph. the whole fire escape thing. face it, casey, street thugs and roboninjas are one thing. but alien threats from other dimensions are a whole different ball game. i took on a giant space worm singlehandedly. yeah, you were singlehandedly eaten by it. have you ever fought living intestines. i don't think so. bottom line, you're in over your head on this one, casey. trust me. i might not have ninja training, but i've achieved a level of awesome, attainable only by casey jones. it's mystical. whoa, dude. check it out, don. you see this carbon scorching. they were taken out by plasma weapons of some sort, tech that's just as advanced as the kraangs. we got to warn the others. the kraang is getting their kraangs handed to them, by those who are not kraang. ah. wow. whoever did this not only destroyed them, they obliterated them. oh, no. it's the kraang. piece of cake. hold on, hothead. ninjas use stealth. ever heard of it. spike. whoa. is that your old pet turtle. the one who got mutated. yeah. his name was spike. it's slash now, remember. good to see you again, raphael. miss me. what are you doing here, slash. we're taking care of the kraang. i got a new partner now. destruction to the kraang. so awesome. who is that. an alien psycho called the newtralizer. what are you guys doing, slash. what you turtles couldn't: wiping out the kraang. keep out of the way. all right, i'll take slash and newtralizer. while you hang back and get aw, casey. goongala. look out. just what i was looking for. and now the plutonium. slash, we have what we came for. see you got a new partner too, raphael. a human. you gonna betray him the way you betrayed me. still holding on to the past, huh, spike. i told you, it's slash now. ooh. i think we're in deep trouble. my head. raph, ice me. you should have never got involved, casey. slash and newtralizer are way too powerful. those two goons are nothing. they lucked out. won't happen again. let's focus, people. we got two crazy mutants running around. blowing up the streets. i think we should shadow the kraang until they show up. easy. since slash and the newtralizer are using plutonium to power their teleportation, we can look for traces of residual radiation. mikey, would you stop eating the kraang locations. hold on, d i'm about to get the high score. and ah. aww. intruders. kraang must warn. let's do this. first we find kraang communications. then we blow this place to raka raka roka raka. blow this place. too dangerous. what about the humans out on the street. remember the day we met. the vow. ah. i owe you one. the name's slash. i can't understand you. i had to help you. these are the most insidious aliens in the ten dimensions. they imprisoned me. they tortured me. i have made a vow never to rest. until i annihilate all of them. i'm with you, brother. destroy the kraang at any cost. "at any cost," right, brother. you think this is the place. either that, or there's one bangin' party going on in there. come on, guys. let's do this. whoa, whoa, hold up. who invited you on this stakeout, anyway. casey jones invited himself. a kraang communication orb. exactly what i was looking for. want to let me in on the plan. in due time. whoa. it's the newtralizer. i totally named that guy. actually, i named him.
