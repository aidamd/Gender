1  oh, look at it. the milky way in all of her ineffable glory. yes. we're heading back to earth. master splinter, new york city, pizza, ice cream kitty. whoohoohoo. yeah. i'll finally get to see dad again. feels like it's been a lifetime. both: ha. uh.  guys, this isn't a celebration. we've got one last shot to stop the triceratons, or we're not gonna have a home to go back to. leonardo is correct. this is our final chance to capture the black hole generator. we cannot travel back in time again. if we fail, earth is doomed. we'll do whatever it takes to stop them, even if it means sacrificing our lives.  ah, don't worry, little guy. i'm not going anywhere. we're gonna go mad crazy on these alien freaks, right. for earth. say it, brother. let's do this. yeah, boy.  warp complete, captain mozar. we have arrived in the orioncygnus arm of the milky way, in earth's solar system. excellent. sergeant zog has located the last kraang outpost. all hail mozar. all: mozar. mozar. mozar. mozar. within mere nextons, earth, home to the vile turtles, will be destroyed.  teenage mutant ninja  the evil triceratons have invaded earth. they brought with them the invincible black hole generator that swallowed the entire planet. my brothers and i escaped, saved by a mysterious robot called the fugitoid. now we're trying to stop the triceratons any way we can. teenage mutant ninja turtles teenage mutant ninja turtles teenage mutant ninja turtles heroes in a half shell, turtle power leonardo's the leader in blue does anything it takes to get his ninjas through donatello is the fellow who has a way with machines raphael's got the most attitude on the team michelangelo, he's one of a kind and you know just where to find him when it's party time master splinter taught 'em every single skill they need to be one lean, mean, green, incredible team teenage mutant ninja turtles teenage mutant ninja turtles teenage mutant ninja turtles heroes in a half shell, turtle power  so how are we gonna take down the black hole generator if it's invulnerable to everything. there is a way. but the entire heart of darkness must be destroyed. not a single piece must remain. what's wrong, professor. i can sense you want to tell us something. my friends, i must confess something to you, something i couldn't reveal until you got to know me better as a humanoid err android. what are you talking about, fugidude. you see, it was not the kraang who invented the black hole generator. it was i who created it. all: what. it can't be. no way. it doesn't make sense. i originally developed the black hole generator as an energy source. but when kraang subprime offered me a huge price to buy it, i gave in. i was greedy. i didn't care what they wanted to use it for. it was all about money, all about financing my research. and then i realized what a terrible decision i had made. i mean, seriously, come on. they're the kraang.  that is messed up, yo. fugitoid, how could you. you you lied to us. everything was a lie. whoa, hold up, leo. the professor's saved our lives over and over he gave us another chance. his heart's in the right place. he doesn't have a heart. he's a robot. earth wouldn't have been destroyed, this insane space chase wouldn't be happening if you didn't build that thing in the first place. ii was a different humanoid all those centuries ago. i've changed. i'm trying to make up for my mistakes. mistakes. calm down, bro. give fugitoid a chance. isn't that something we've all learned by now. to give someone a second chance. i don't want to be a part of fugitoid's plans anymore. i'll come up with my own plan to take down the triceratons.   faster. we must get to the earth. captain mozar, the turtles approach. are they cloaked. no, sir. they are coming in fast. your orders. hold your fire until we round mars. and then we will unleash our entire fleet. let us be done with these pests. don't you understand. a direct assault is futile. and odds are we'll be the ones assaulted. we got no choice, fugitoid. yeah. thanks to you. i understand.        leo. he never came back. leo, come in. answer your comm. oh, no, he's about to do something really stupid.   dude, leo, don't do this, bro. we need you up here. don't you guys get it. fugitoid's just using us to get his black hole machine. i know what needs to be done.   leo, think rationally. you can't bring down their mother ship with the scout ship.        oh, yeah. eat it.        uhoh.        ah.  ah. leo. no. after him. quick. rock rockets coming in fast. full power to shields. brace for impact. oh.     ah, come on. work. we got to save leo. professor, do something. don't you think i'm trying. or do you think i enjoy plummeting straight for the surface of mars.  excellent. engineers, full speed ahead. we have a planet to destroy.    oh, no. controls are frozen.  dark matter convertors failing. power depleting. brain spinning. leo was right. he's useless.  activating secondary systems. overriding controls. sending dark matter to the thrusters.    yes. you did it, professor. now come on. we got to save leo.  i've got him on scanner. he's right up ahead.    do something, donnie. his heart stand back.  ahh.   ugh. leo. you're back. i thought you were a goner, dude. you got to chill out, man. enough with the crazy oneman missions. leaders are called leaders because they're supposed to lead a team. sorry ugh guys. just don't do that again. i'm just glad you're alive, bro. come on. no time. help me get to the bridge. still got to stop mozar. the triceratons have probably made it to earth as we speak.      ah. earth creatures. attack.    bishop. no.   we heard you might need some assistance.   splinter. and reinforcements. yes. guys, um, you do realize we're still in extraordinarily horrendous trouble, right. so what do we do. we kick their jurassic. cowabunga. impossible. how did the turtles get back to earth before us. i want answers.  great scott, more are about to beam down.     foolish little one. you are coming with me.  mikey. michelangelo. ahh.   there's still a chance we can stop the triceratons, right. well, we will arrive on earth approximately five minutes sooner than the last time i arrived bloop. mm, five minutes ain't bad. are you crazy. that's not enough time. i don't get it. we had those black hole generator fragments. why didn't we just drop them into a star when we had the chance. i designed the generator so it is only vulnerable to a combination of fusion and dark matter. so if you will calm down and allow me to um, guys. look. i'm tapping into earth's satellite footage.  the triceratons are ready to set off the black hole generator again.  dudes, look at this. i'm zooming in. that's you guys, right. in the stealth ship, coming to rescue me. you remember that.   you guys blowed up. ahh. mikey, calm down. we had a teleporter.  we're alive. you snagged a teleporter. you mean we could've just beamed here. there's only one charge, and i  oh, man, we're in trouble.    guys, that was awesome. thanks for the sweet rescue. so who's gonna rescue us next. april. casey. the little one does not seem to recognize me. let me ask you a question. do you turtles know me. actually, no. never seen you before. nuhuh. nope. fascinating. it looks like i must eliminate all of the turtles to be done with you.  here is my plan. while you six aid your past selves in stopping the triceraton guards, i will capture the black hole generator with my tractor beam. so you drop us off on earth and fly off with the generator alone. forget it.  i can sense you're hiding something from us, professor. you're lying to us. cough it up, fuge. what's the deal, yo. there is no deal. it is imperative that you all follow my exact plan without question. we can't make that promise, professor. we're going to earth, all right, and you're coming with us.  no, i am not. and if you will not implement my plan, then you are no longer wanted on this ship.        whoa. tractor beam, dudes.  fugitoid saved us. no. he just felt guilty. you just wait. he's gonna steal the black hole weapon before the day is done. let's move, guys. washington square is right around the corner.    man, that mozar was one crazy weirdo. come on. we got a world to save.          guacamole.  those guys are us.        master splinter, no.   what's this.  i knew you were a snake, but stopping me from saving the world. it is because of you karai is gone. agh.    yes. the timer is down. we're gonna win.   uhoh.  so you timetraveled back to save your world, which means i destroyed it the first time around, did i not. now mozar will win the second round.  dudes, i get it. those guys are us from the future. no, dudes. you're us in the past.    hooah. foolish reptiles.    no matter. i only need these.   huh. ah.        i will rid the world of a vile monster.   the only monster here is you, saki.    aagh.  ugh. master shredder.   you have won this time, but don't count the foot out for long.     hey, you're not too bad for a time clone. goongala.    this is not over.    take us back to the mother ship. triceratons, we shall power up the mother ship to destroy their city. then we shall retrieve the heart of darkness from its ashes and wipe out the entire earth.  sensei. father.   oh, no. fugitoid's got the generator.  it's what he wanted all along.   i i get it now. he said the only way to destroy the black hole generator is a combination of fusion and dark matter. which means. the ship uses dark matter, and the fugitoid is powered by a fusion core. that's that's why he wanted us off the ship. he didn't want to steal it. he's sacrificing himself. no. fugitoid, don't do it. it has to be this way, my friends. if you knew my intent, you would have surely tried to stop me, and for that, i thank you. sir, we are ready and awaiting your command. power up the devastator.  destroy the city now.   let it be known that you are my friends, and i love you all.  oh, no.   no.    i do not fully understand what transpired here this evening, but i thank my sons, both present and future. so, uh, what are we gonna do about this. the earth isn't big enough for two casey joneses. hey, back off, punk. i don't know. i always kind of wanted a twin sister. wow. me too. this is actually kind of cool.  what. fugitoid. he's back. wait. if there are two sets of us in this universe, then there would be two fugitoids as well.  hello, my dear friends. my name is professor zayton honeycutt. how would you like to go on a wondrous adventure. wow, space. really. that sounds incredible. dudes, that is so sweet. space is awesome, guys, and if there's one guy in the universe you can trust, it's the professor. thank you, leonardo. perhaps we'll all meet again in the future. we'll miss you. goodbye, sensei.  hold up. wait for us. i think we must talk about this. later. don't eat the vanarian muffins.  got to say, i've seen a lot of weird days, but this has got to be one of the weirdest. have i got some stories for you, pal. i would like to hear some stories as well, my sons. how about first thing tomorrow, sensei. tonight, i need some sleep.    )
