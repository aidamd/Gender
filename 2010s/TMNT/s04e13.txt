couldn't we just once go to the planet of comfy pillows and endless free pizza. it's also the home of tokka, one of the six great cosmic monsters of the universe. it is an ancient vorkathian fire beast protecting the final fragment of the black hole generator with its life. if we could keep from losing it this time, we might pull this off. now approaching magdomar. the triceraton fleet must be near. we must avoid them at all cost. bloop. i see them. on the other side of the planet. closing in. they're launching raptors. they're gonna find the black hole thingy before us. it's not a thingy.

dregg's heading for mozar's destroyer. mozar. i've got your precious weapon fragment, but you must destroy tokka. give me sanctuary and 100 million zemulaks, or i drop it into a star. you vile pirate. but i suppose we have a deal.   fire.  um, guys. the triceratons are firing rockets straight into that dwarf star. surely they would not be so foolish as to trigger the destruction of that dying star  what am i saying. of course they would.  ahh.  chompy was with her. and now now he's gone. then who's this hitching a ride on your shell. aw. chompy. aw, little guy. you're okay. but but what about tokka. she was just trying to protect the fragment and chompy. what about earth. thank you for the final fragment. your 100 million zemulaks are right in there. where. i don't see anything. where is
