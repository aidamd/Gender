okay down there. we're cool. hot tub time. all right. not all right. that water's boiling at around 200 degrees fahrenheit. it's under intense pressure. i think we're stuck in some sort of geyser. it must erupt all the time. that's why the walls are so smooth. how long do we got. an hour. less. then we're turtle soup. so how do we get out. no problem. we'll tie all our grappling hooks together. ugh. okay, one problem. i forgot my grappling hook. yeah, me too. some ninjas. oh. whatwhat were the odds we'd be kidnapped by a giant mutant. have you met us. what are the odds we wouldn't be

bro. it's good to be back. yeah, i mean, if you're not leading, who am i supposed to complain about. april. ii'm really sorry i tested that neurotransmitter on you. i'm not. without that psychic link, we'd have lost you guys. plus it was cool to see through someone else's eyes for a change. even if it was a giant mutant beast. but the link's broken now. the chimera's finally gone. )
