1x21 karai's vendetta why were you hunting the turtles. they don't talk much outside their little houses. krkrkraang is lacking the knowledge to answer the questions that the one known as shredder is asking of kraang. do they all speak like this. even if kraang is possessing the knowledge, the one known as shredder will never be getting that knowledge from kraang. you didn't have any other plans for today, did you. let's try again. why were you hunting the turtles. the ones known as the turtles are protecting the life form needed by kraang, the one known as april o'neil. who is this april o'neil. she is the one known as the one. she is the link which is missing in the plan which is the plan of kraang. so this april o'neil is at the center of everything. then perhaps we can use her to draw the turtles out of hiding. karai, find this girl, and bring her to me. teenage mutant ninja turtles teenage mutant ninja turtles teenage mutant ninja turtles heroes in a half shell, turtle power. here we go, it's the lean green ninja team on the scene, cool teens doing ninja things so extreme, out the sewer like laser beams get rocked with the shell shock pizza kings can't stop these radical dudes the secret of the ooze made the chosen few emerge from the shadows to make their move the good guys win and the bad guys lose. leonardo's the leader in blue does anything it takes to get his ninjas through donatello is the fellow has a way with machines raphael's got the most attitude on the team michelangelo, he's one of a kind and you know just where to find him when it's party time. master splinter taught them every single skill they need to be one lean mean green incredible team. teenage mutant ninja turtles teenage mutant ninja turtles teenage mutant ninja turtles heroes in a half shell, turtle power. whoa. what you gonna do. what you gonna do. what you gonna do. booyakasha. you got faced. thought you had me, but i played you like a trombone. play time's over, tough guy. put me down. enough. uncle. i don't see you tapping out. i can't move my arms. then tap your horrible, disgusting middle toe. don't worry, stubby. you're not as horrible as he says. michelangelo, why did you give up so easily. there was nothing i could do. there is always something you can do. observe. raphael, kannuki jime. the key is to unbalance your opponent. but how. however you can. for example whoa. you see. there is always a way. blech, and you need to take a bath. the landing party is under attack by the digesters. we have to save them. if we keep bailing them out, they'll never learn to take care of themselves. but this is their first mission, and they don't even have weapons. then they'd better learn fast. say, doctor mindstrong, weren't you in love with that one. i was, captain. well, it looks like you both learned a lesson today. hey, guys. guess what april and i have been up to. that's right. analyzing sewage. who says you don't know how to show a girl a good time. april and i were going through some files on the kraang storage device. we found out that they're using a special process to change earth's water into kraang water. they've already started the process. we found a low concentration of kraang chemicals in the sewage. whoa. and i take it that's a bad thing. watch what happens when i dip this slice of mikey's shrimp and sardine pizza into pure kraang water. how do you sleep at night. presently, there's only a tiny bit in the water supply, but the concentration is increasing, which means every slice of pizza in new york will be destroyed. along with anyone who uses water. i don't want to live in a world without pizza. look out. huh. wha nothing happened to you. maybe it's 'cause she's not made out of pizza. the scanners located the kraang facility transforming the water supply, which is right here. we gotta stop it. looks like we got a mission. you coming, april. sounds like a blast, but unfortunately, it's on the bottom of the east river, and equally unfortunately, i have an essay due. plus i wouldn't mind a little human food. pizza's human food. not the way you eat it. whoa, whoa, whoa, you're going topside. you got your tphone, right. donnie, don't worry. i'll be fine. so, donnie, how are we gonna get out there. don't worry, guys. i've been working on something that is pretty awesome. this is not awesome. seriously, donnie. a submarine powered by bicycles. you know what would have been more efficient. swimming. ha. hey, pipe down, guys. kinetic energy is the only way to charge the engines, which should be done right about now. we're almost there. up periscope. uh, donnie. any chance this kraang facility looks like a giant sea mutant. oh, that's not a mutant. based on his physiology, i'd say the kraang brought him here from dimension "x". how is that less horrifying. it's not. i just like to be accurate. well, whatever it is, it looks like it's guarding that. wow. let's go stealth. hmm, this is new. what is this thing. oh, that's how you order. they have these in tokyo. you give this to the chef. oh, thanks. mind if i join you. sure. why not. hi, murakamisan. aprilchan. how are you. ah, pizza gyoza. hai. chou oishi. you speak japanese. i picked up a few words from my brothers. brothers. tell me about them. oh, you know, just crazy animals. pretty much. although i've never heard of pizza gyoza back in tokyo. that's because murakami invented it. you should try one. that sounds great. you should try some of mine. done. hai. what's your name. i'm april. my name's harmony. kraang should increase the molecular conversion of that which is water. we gotta get in there before that sea monster comes back. how are we gonna get past those guards. we make them come to us. kraang, there is a blockage which is preventing the flow of that which has been blocked. kraang must come with kraang to dislodge the blockage that needs dislodging. but water gives kraang's membrane wrinkly fingers. we're in. and that thing is back. how are we gonna get out of here. we'll worry about that later. right now, we've got bigger fish to fry. i don't think we're gonna find a bigger fish than that. what. come on, that was good. you gotta give me that one. so what brings you to new york. i'm with my dad. he's here trying to close an old deal. oh. what does he do. he's in kitchen utensils. knives, mostly. itadakimasu. "itatakimas". all right, let's see what these pizza potstickers are all about. mm. best dumpling ever. i know, right. now you try mine. what is it. suppon nabe. turtle soup. karai. in person. uh, i gotta go. i was thinking you'd come with me, april o'neil. my father would love to meet you. let go of me. oh. i am so sorry. okay, we have to be quiet. do you have to say that every time. we're ninjas. we know how to be quiet. ooh, that is embarrassing. april, hi. it's not a great time. donnie, karai's after me. what. oof. karai's after april. we gotta help her. and who's gonna help us. april, i'm sorry. we can't get there. but don't you worry. you just stay calm and run. run for your life. is that pizza for o'neil. nah, it's for, um hey. what are you doing. i'll bring it back. i promise. huh. whoa. donnie, focus. april can take care of herself. against karai. are you kidding. i've gotta help her. you're not gonna be much help if you get blasted in the head. whoa. good point. that's a twofer. thank you, and thank you and thank you. how many times have i told you. no celebrating till the fight is over. how many times have i told you, i assumed it was over. children, children. we have to go. um, have you forgotten about a little something called completing the mission. but april's in danger. if we leave now, the kraang will poison everyone in new york, which, last time i check, includes april. think, donnie. how do we take this place out. well, uh, the chemical is highly explosive. how do you know that. partly because it has a hydrocarbon on its outer ring, and partly because of that sign. raph, do you think you can get this blaster open for me. with pleasure. but before you do, be careful you don't oh, good. we're still alive. now i'll short out the power supply and leave it by the chemical tanks. it'll overheat, and the whole place will go boom. all right. victory dance. mikey. mikey. or maybe later. there, in about 90 seconds, this whole place is gonna blow. all right, let's move. april, what's your status. could be better. okay, we're on our way. we'll be there soon. actually, it might be a slight delay. gotcha. we've only got 30 seconds before that blaster explodes. uh, guys, any ideas. well, let's see. we're cornered by an amphibious sea monster in an underwater base that's about to blow up. i'm out. whoa. whoa. whoa. that was fun. mikey, that victory dance better not last more than four seconds. huh. that wasn't such a chore, now, was it. great, now we can get back to apr are you kidding me.. donnie, can you make this thing go faster. of course i can. wow, that is fast. pedal faster. feelin' the burn. go, go, go. that's it. it's got us. we' gonna die. hey, we're not that kind of sub. you've got guts. let's see if i can pound that out of you. a tessen. beautiful. unassuming but very powerful. in the right hands. good one. glad you enjoyed it. now it's my turn. what makes you so special. you're the center of an alien conspiracy, protected by mutants and trained by a great ninja master. why. i don't know. i'm flunking trig. my friends are mutants. aliens got my dad. and i lost my mother. what. you lost your mother. the key is to unbalance your opponent. not bad for a nobody. come on, april. come on, april. hey, donnie. april. you're okay. you hear that, guys. my sweet princess is alive. did i mute that. let's agree that you did. you got it. and when her guard was down, i flipped her down the subway steps and bolted. that is awesome. you rock. kick butt. impressive, april. you used your training well, and you fulfilled the most important goal of the ninja: to come home alive. thank you, sensei. looks like i can take care of myself after all. yes. and no. huh. karai may have failed this time, but if shredder wants you, he will stop at nothing to find you. and with the kraang after you as well, the wisest decision is for you to remain here in the sewer with us. what. oh, that's great. i mean, oh, that's horrible. that, you know, your life as you know it is is over and, um i'll shut up now. i can't stay down here. i mean, what about school, my friends, everything. april, master splinter's right. until we stop shredder and the kraang, this is the only place you're safe. so once we stop them, i can have my life back. yes. let's get started. )
