fellowship of turtles. now i shall prepareth thy next adventure. then i will playeth the game with you forever. and ever and ever. forget it, malachi. we figured it out. we did. this whole thing is an

lightning of lorenzo. rockets of ravendorf. everyone, listen. malachi is a mutant. he's creating the maze inside our minds. inside our minds. are you crazy, leo. he's got magic, but i've got the +1

it's up to you now, raph. i'm trying. raph. i don't believe. no. yes. i'm handsome again. we're not playing anymore, malachi. we're back. oh, man. ooh. you shall not pass. we were in the sewers the whole time. what were you trying to do. ii just wanted to play. my name is martin milton. i used to be obsessed with mazes & mutants. every hour, every day. all that changed the day i was feeding the birds on my roof. i donned fair cloak and wizardly hat, to become sir malachi, the sparrow wizard. i went into the sewers to play a solo larping game of mazes & mutants. when i accidentally found you. i made sure you found the game. i was so happy you liked it, so happy indeed. i just wanted people to play with. dude, solo larp. that is so sad. aw, malachi wasn't entirely bad. he did leave us clues that everything was an illusion. it really was a game. you can go, malachi. but you have to promise that you'll never force anyone to play with you ever again. sounds faireth to me. boom. wah. boom. boo. boowah. bwah. boo. boom. goodbyeth, my friends. live long and larp. and thus the turtle champions fought the wizard sir malachi. and won by the sheer power of their awesomeness. booyakasha. um, guys. hey, wait up. )
