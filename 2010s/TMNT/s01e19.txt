1x19 baxter's gambit whoa. that's a subspatial endoparticle disrupter. gonna have to explain if that's "oh, no" or "yay. " in the hands of the kraang, it's a definite "oh, no. " why. what does it do. the disrupter can desynchronize subatomic resonances, which invert polymolecular structures, causing them to implode. it makes things go "boom. " technically, it makes things go zweechooooo. pop. it's important to be accurate. with that endoparticle disrupter in our arsenal, we'll be unstoppable. all right, men, we move on my signal. your signal. please, don't hurt me. you do what we say, and then you thank us for letting you live. got it, stinkman. whoa stockman. it's stockman. what was that. nothing. thank you for letting me live. screw this up, i'll finish you myself. remember that. just you wait, freaks. okay, guys. get in position. on my mark. ready set let's just do this. enough talk. kraang and fishface and dogpound. i

taught them every single skill they need to be one lean mean green incredible team. teenage mutant ninja turtles teenage mutant ninja turtles teenage mutant ninja turtles heroes in a half shell, turtle power. aw, man. just so we're clear, sensei, you are planning on swinging, ri yes. what is the point of this, anyway. evading a sword you cannot see demonstrates an ability to sense your enemy's intention. i already know my enemy's intention, sensei to take me down. knowing that your enemy will strike is a given. but sensing when he will strike can mean the difference between victory and defeat. hai, sensei. we had the alien technology in our grasp, master. unfortunately, stockman's plan was flawed. is this true. well, um, yes. they're right. it was my fault. i'm sorry. and i'd like to make amends. that is, if you'd allow me. you see, i've designed a trap for the turtles a foolproof trap. but i'd need the help of my good friends here to lure them into it. very well. consider those two at your disposal. hup, hup, hup. i got eyes on one giant dog and fish. 6:00. where. aw, man. it's just fishface and dogpound. what are they doing out in the open like this. i think we should proceed with caution, guys. guys. oh, man. where were we. oh, yeah. i was turning you into fish sticks. actually, i believe i was turning you into turtle soup. stay. good dog. look. we got 'em on the run. oh, they aren't getting off that easy. raph, wait. something's not right. yeah, you talking while they're getting away. very good. again. sensei, not that i don't enjoy running ukes six thousand times, but when do i get a weapon. ah, but april, you already possess the kunoichi's most powerful weapon the mind. when was the last time you saw someone hit a guy over the head with their mind. true. let's find you a weapon. this way. all right. you got us. this is way too easy. why are you always worrying. oh, i see. careful, guys. this may be a trap. welcome, contestants. i'm so glad you could join us tonight. blister stockboy. it's baxter stockman. i'm your archnemesis. i can totally think of five nemesises way archer than him. you'll be playing for the ultimate prize your lives in the all new, familyfriendly, incredibly deadly maze of doom. you fool. what are you doing. i'm sick of you freaks. you treat me like dirt, threaten me well, baxter stockman doesn't make threats. have you gone mad. mad. i'm full on mega crazy. you traitor. and even if you make it through my maze alive, you'll still have to face my monster of doom. is it a monster of doom. no. uh, monster of, uh uh oh, the heck with it. where in the where were we. total turtle takedown. what is uhoh. this can't be good. watch out. i saved you why, calamari boy. everyone, i suggest a fight rain check. never. we do this now. huh. if we keep fighting, we are never going to get out of here alive. the exit. there. follow me. leo, you don't think we can trust them, do you. it's our only option. well, what do we do when they turn on us. because they will turn on us. we'll just have to trust that we'll see it coming first. remember, april, your weapon chooses you as much as you choose it. i think it chose the tree. almost got it. whoa. wha perhaps we should keep looking. i have my eye on you, turtles. fresh air. coming from that direction. uh, please, after you. no, no, you go ahead. i insist. what's the matter. you don't trust me. if you think we're going to turn our backs to you, you're nuts. i know. we go like this turtle, turtle, jerk, turtle, turtle, jerk. wait, no. jerk, turtle, jerk, jerk no, too many jerks. balls. of doom. what are those. not good. let's move it. me first. doom balls. run. whew. wait. we've been here before. he's right. we've been going in circles. donnie, are you sure hey. time to split you boys up. looks like it's just you and me. you're wasting your time, leonardo. those walls are magnetically sealed. i tried that already, donnie. there's no signal. i know. i'm reconfiguring the tphone's internal magnet so that it can detect ambient a/c current. we can use it to trace our way back to baxter. you two, keep stinkman talking. no problemo. hey, boxton. it's baxter. so i was wondering, what made you interested in a career in supervillainy. well, since you won't be around to read my autobiography, i'll tell you. i was a frail and delicately sensitive young child well, there's a surprise. that's when i decided to develop my greatest power my technological genius. oh, good grief. remember, keep your movement fluid. oh, master splinter, i am so sorry. who are they. that is me, my wife, and daughter, before shredder the baby she was beautiful. yes. miwa would have been about your age now. i would like to think she would have turned out as well as you have, my child. which reminds me wait here. the world's longest tunnel of doom. what. we're trapped. well, that makes us even, huh, fish sticks. you think i'd let baxter do away with you. ha. that is a pleasure i am reserving for myself. and i built a science fair volcano, but with actual molten lava. burnt down the whole gymnasium. i was expelled. and i vowed revenge on those who wronged me. you poor, poor man. tell me, xever. what's a nice fish like you doing with a guy like shredder. in many ways, it's all i've ever known. at a young age, i learned a very simple rule you want something, you take it. i was the best thief, until one day, my luck ran out. they would have left me to rot there. fortunately, the owner of that briefcase found my skills useful. shredder. yes. and he employed me for many of the foot's dirtier jobs. most recently, the destruction of you, your brothers, and your sensei. so you do all this because you owe shredder. eh, mostly i like having a job where i get to crack skulls every day. okay, i can relate to that. yes. we are of a kind, you and i. well, maybe. but i'm still going to whip your butt when this is over. whoa. skunkman. i know you're in here somewhere. hey, it's coming from the next room. you enjoy your play date. ha. very funny. a strong ambient a/c current is coming from underneath this cannon. no. you were supposed to destroy each other, not work together. no matter. you may have made it to the end of my maze, but now it's time for the bonus round. yes, the bonus round of doom. kneel before the awesome power of my monster of doom. of doom. you all think you're so clever. let's see how clever you are when you're hit by my missiles of d when you're hit by my missiles. how do we stop this thing. mikey, dogpound. draw it under baxter. ha. nice try. but you'll have to be faster than that. yoohoo, monster of doom. we're over here. raph, fishface. there. ready. three, two, one no. stop helping each other. where's dexter. fools. you haven't seen the last of dexter baxter stockman. i had intended to one day pass this on to my daughter, but i would like you to have it. it's beautiful. yes, and i think we found my weapon. the truce is over. let's finish this. booyaka ah, forget it. next time. you know, raph, you and fishface actually made a pretty good team back there. he's still our enemy, mikey, and he'll take us out the first chance he gets. trust your senses. you'll see 'em coming. )
