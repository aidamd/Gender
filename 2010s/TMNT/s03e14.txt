  new york city this is what it looks like after alien invasion. we returned to a broken, almost deserted city, courtesy of the kraang. the turtles invaded dimension x to stop those alien freaks and undo the mutation of millions of people. meanwhile, i was sidelined like a chump, salvaging food and medical supplies like it was the zombie apocalypse or something.  i totally got ripped.  casey jones should've been in that fight.  got to say, though, it's kind of cool how almost getting annihilated can bring the city together. well, most of the city. then there's the others: thieves, lowlifes and thugs, and worse, purple dragons.   who knew withdrawing money from a bank could be so easy.  nobody steals in my town. it's that vigilante nut. let's crack him open then.   ho, ho. a new recruit. ready to taste some asphalt, scum. not a recruit. i'm the new leader. . hun.  eh, i think i prefer scum.   goongala. hiyah.             teenage mutant ninja turtles teenage mutant ninja

turtles teenage mutant ninja turtles teenage mutant ninja turtles heroes in a half shell, turtle power  what a disaster. the kraang really trashed this place. indeed, but this is our home. we will clean and set things right once more. oh, i hate cleaning.  i call the kitchen.     hey, raph, a little help.  oh. oh, no. my experiments. my lab. miwa what has become of you.  there you go, ice cream kitty. nice and chilly. now to see what's for din  what reeks. our food ruined.  hmm, roaches, rotten pepperoni, furry stuff. i may regret that tomorrow, but worth it today.    well, look what the cat dragged in. where you been, jones. doing what you should be helping the city, stopping crime. whoa, hold up. in case you hadn't noticed, we just got back here. yeah, we just happened to stop a little thing called a massive alien invasion. yeah, dude, we deserve a little downtime. evil never takes downtime. i just took on the purple dragons.  ooh.  so how bad you beat 'em. well, at least i stopped 'em from getting away with the cash.  wait, you didn't beat the purple dragons.  you don't want to help. fine. i don't need you guys. casey jones can protect the city alone.  good luck with that.   those jerks. whatever, i can do this myself. first up, track down the stupid dragons and pound their new leader in his lame head.  the foot. guess the dragons will have to wait.   #  shredder. things just got interesting.   #     crazy thing, that alien invasion. but such moments in history can prove fortuitous for businessmen like us, huh. us. you are just a gangster, don vizioso.  you seem unaware that the power in this city has shifted. . to me. what are you trying to say, shredder. must i spell it out. yeah, i don't read so good. i already control the russian mob through steranko, the asian gangs via hun, and the south americans through xever, so either declare your allegiance to me, or  so how might i be of service. access to certain chemicals for a project i'm working on. well, i already told you about the shipment at the docks. what more do you  who sent you, spy. i'm i'm just a busboy.  very well, but do not let me see your face ever again. that was close. too close. oh, man, my heart's pounding so fast. that was so cool. wait till raph hears about this. oh, man. need a break. no doubt. cleaning up is way harder than training. wait, no. no, no. no, no, no, no.   what are you looking for, mikey.  the tv remote, duh. where are you.  got a text from casey. oh, no, he's on some kind of crazy mission. i got to go handle this. want some help.  i'm sure it's nothing to worry about. no. it's gone forever. farewell, sweet tvcontrolling device. you made our lives so much better. you were a true friend in times of wait, here it is.   that's it, gorrick army. you are angering crognard's enormous pecs. um, crognard, the gorricks outnumber us 1,000 to 1. you realize we're doomed, right. never tell crognard the odds.   oh, snap.  xever, let's get those robot legs moving. back off, man. we talked about this. we are not the boss of me. technically i'm field commander when tiger claw's not around, which means i am your boss.  yeah, yeah, whatever. just wait till those turtles hear about this.  goongala.   the class is pain 101. your instructor is casey jones. did you really just say that, kid.  doggie, fetch.  hmm.      i grow tired of you i'm gonna enjoy taking this kid apart piece by piece.  bring it on, freaks. i ain't going down without busting a few fangs. only way i bust a fang is if i'm chewing on your mask.  huh.   come on. hold up.  a little help.   have you taken too many pucks to the head. no way can you beat those two alone.   well, i stopped them from stealing this case, didn't i. what's so important you'd risk your stupid life for. i don't know. let's find out.  dangerous chemicals. good things we were flinging this case around. we'll take it back to donnie. he'll know what they are. come on. no way. you take it to donnie. i'm going after shredder. are you crazy. shredder is a dangerous assassin. you don't stand a chance. i mean, not even the slightest chance, the tiniest, tiniest, ittiest, bittiest i get it. go take your little case to donnie. casey jones works better alone. alone are you serious. casey, wait. casey.    fear not, karai. soon you will be cured of this vile mutation. isn't that right, stockman.  of course, sir.  you had better arrive at a solution soon. master shredder, the purple dragons have arrived. lord shredder.  we have found more of the chemical components you've been seeking. excellent. i am impressed, hun.   master, given your karai issue, we have no equipment for such work. then find me the equipment, you imbecile. yes, master shredder. you could take over the factory where we found the chemicals. it is on our turf. it would be my honor to show it to you personally, master shredder. very well. proceed.   are you crazy. you just let casey go off on his own. let him. what was i supposed to do, chain him to a wall. i told him not to go.  for real. my bad. sorry, donnie. well, i'm stumped. i have no idea what this chemical is. it's not mutagenbased. maybe it is an explosive. the thing is, we've seen stockman's lab, and he doesn't have the equipment to synthesize these chemicals. only mutagen.  mm, what kind of place would have equipment like that. don't talk with your mouth full. and eating cheesy balls. do you even know what's in that. it's allnatural, brah. deenriched corn husks, hydrogenated styrodextrin, red dye 42 mmm. trinucleonized whaaa.  it's not allnatural, mikey. in fact, it's probably slightly radioactive.   manufactured by auman chemicals, new york. wait a sec, that place is in chinatown, right.  it is. it's the biggest chemical manufacturing plant in the city. and if it's in chinatown, that means it's controlled by the purple dragons, right. cheesy balls for the win.   everything you need, master shredder, from mixing vats, extrusion machines, kilns, bottling facilities you name it. you've done well to bring this factory to my attention, hun. it will be adequate for my plans. i have one request. since this factory is on dragon territory, perhaps i should be in charge. so be it. success is to be rewarded, as failure is to be punished.     looking for me.   i will make your end swift, boy.  i ain't afraid of you.  okay. i might be a little afraid of you. you. now i will end this game and your insignificant   you have spirit, boy, but i tire of this game.    hiyah. what. aw, yeah.  destroy them. do not let them near that vat. i don't need you guys. i had this. and i have you.      whoa.  yes, run, you little fool. run. who's running, rahzar. booyakasha.    this is it, shredder. you're not gonna walk away from this. i have no time for idle threats, turtle.  hiyah.   hockey boy, i will end you.  let's go.   #  my opportunity to impress shredder, to carve a position for myself, and you ruined it.  i'm crying on the inside for you.     wait, chemicals. this must be where they keep all the additives for mikey's cheesy snacks. if i can contaminate shredder's chemicals oh, donatello, i love your mind.  what are you doing, turtle. talking to yourself like a weirdo.  no. you need to control your anger. control this, cat.   oh. no. huh. whew. no.    casey, get that container into the mixing vat.   goongala.  later, scum. i mean, hun.  stop him.    where do you think you're going.  later, fishface.    he shoots. he scores. no. you fools. what is that gunk, donnie. it's the secret ingredient in mikey's cheesy balls. yeah. wait, what. let's get out of here.     the turtles think they've won this fight, but all they've done is delay my plans. get this place cleaned up and start again. hmm. actually quite delicious. got to hand it to you, casey. you kind of saved the day. not to mention you took on shredder, and you're still in one piece.  aw, yeah, casey. high three.  you guys are the best. i couldn't have done it without you, but don't think i'm 100% a team player, 'cause casey jones is still a solo vigilante of the night, a mysterious lone hero in a world of evil. whatever.  oh, no. guys, this is even worse than i thought. shredder's mixture it's not an explosive. so what is it. i think he's working on a mindcontrol formula. if it works, he could use it on karai or us or every single person in new york city.  )
