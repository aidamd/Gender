aren't we all. sensei, can we rest for a sec. rest. hmm, the shredder will not rest until you are all dead. sensei, we've been training nonstop for weeks with hardly any sleep. they need a break. oh, like you don't. that's right, raph. i don't. ah, well, then, i'll give you a break. if i were the shredder, none of you would be breathing right now. understand. perhaps a brief rest is in order. we will resume later. ahh. the panicons hit me with an anxiety ray. ahh. ohh. we're all gonna die. and i think i left the food replicator on. the ship might burn down. get it together, captain. you're our leader, so act like one. i'm sorry, grundch. that was the anxiety ray talking. i've got it. i'll use the thermal charge. what. hey, what are you doing. oh, sorry. it was spike's idea. he said space heroes is too stupid for him. that's saying something, considering he hangs out with you all day. nice going, leo. you made him angry, so i'm gonna mop the floor with your face. all right, raph. cool off. i can help with that. doctor prankenstein strikes again. dude, you should see your face right now. you look so mad. okay, spike. you'll like this show. it's called "does mikey bend that way." come here, you. you're still working on that gokart. it's not a gokart. it's an allterrain patrol buggy with detachable sidecars. dude, hasn't splinter been riding us hard enough. you gotta find a way to relax. we all deal with stress in different ways, mikey. yeah, and this is how i deal. and this is how i deal. you're next, leo. doctor prankenstein makes house calls. hey. did, uh, somebody here order a totally delicious pizza. no. beat it. you sure. i mean, the guy who paid on the phone gave me this address, or was it a block over. i'm so confused. oh, that pizza. yeah, that's us. check it out. free pizza. gotcha. hoko no kamae. raph, hoko no kamae. hoko no way. it's bad enough splinter's driving us into the ground. now you too. we have to keep training, because, right now, we don't stand a chance against shredder. yeah, and he's up there somewhere waiting for us. i just freaked myself out. i hate to say it, but the fact that we've been laying low might be the only reason we're still alive. exactly, so until we're ready, we stay down here. unfortunately, that's not an option. we're meeting shredder tonight. he's got a plan to destroy the turtles. how. he doesn't even know where they are. he says they're in the sewers somewhere, and that's all he needs to know to wipe them out. our home is no longer safe. the shredder must be stopped. how can we stop a plan we don't even know. we have to go topside, and find out what they're planning. raph's right. there's no other way. this is the place. donnie, you're crowding me. sorry. sorry. all that splinter talk about how we're not ready has me thinking maybe we're in over our heads. you're always in over your head. i'm saying now we all are. and that scares me. it's okay to be scared, mikey. raph is scared, too. i am not scared. you should be. bradford. radbrad. look what i found, four soontobeexturtles. i'm sure glad it's okay to be scared. you and me both. this is no time to panic. okay, maybe a little. he keeps getting taller. then i'll cut him down to size. uh, let's stick together on this one. this is hopeless. keep your head in the game. i just want to keep my head on my body. come on, what are we retreating for. that's a good reason. mikey, smoke. what was that. i'm stressed. excuse me if my aim's a little off. how hard is it to hit the ground. not so easy, is it. oh, will you guys just we couldn't take him. dogpound was just too powerful. dogpound. what. 'cause he's a dog, and he pounded us into the we get it. i don't see how we're gonna get close to that meeting now. well, maybe we just need to find a new place to hide. i hear the sewers in florida are nice this time of year. no, i'm not letting you guys give up. i'll spy on the meeting. no way. nuhuh. you can't. forget it. absolutely not. i can do this. you've been training me to be a kunoichi. for a few weeks. what choice do we have. shredder's gonna attack your home, and we need to find out how, and i'm the only one who can do it. i don't like this. me neither. giving the enemy a free pizza. pssh, never a good idea. hey, did somebody here order a totally delicious pizza. looks like the foot clan are smarter than the purple dragons. they'd almost have to be, wouldn't they. thanks, april. you did your best. at least we've still got the pizza. oh, i'm not done yet. wait, what is she doing. not the pizza. she's gone rogue. may i help you. sir, i'm with the firefighters association, local 94. we've received reports of some faulty wiring in this building, so mind if i have a looksee. well, i don't think thanks. she's so cool. listen carefully. five of you will hijack a tanker truck on houston in approximately 15 minutes. the chemical is extremely rare, so you will not have another chance. chemical. what chemical. how about we listen and find out. how about i break your shell on my knee. how about you two shut it for a minute while we try to hear shredder's evil plan. which will destroy them once and for all. now go. we missed it. oh, great. nice going, guys. we've gotta get april out. no, if we rush in there, we put her at risk. we wait. i'm gonna hitch a ride, see where they go. no, you've done enough. now get out of there. bradford heard you. april. run. buckle up. no. we're too late. april. april. are you there. she's not gonna answer, leo. what do we do. we gotta get april out of that van, but but dogpound's in there, and we're not ready to fight that guy. aw, splinter was right. we should've stayed below. can't believe i'm gonna say this. "get it together, captain. you're our leader. so act like one. " you're right, raph. that was the anxiety ray talking. what, that's it. you're not gonna slap yourself. psst, let's save april. and our home. but we'll never catch him on foot. we're not going on foot. yeah, this is rad. it's not ready. this thing is awesome. does it have a radio. no, it doesn't have a radio. i'm telling you it's not ready. seems ready to me. whoa. eh, okay, don't pull on that, and we'll be fine. the tanker. catch it. get. out. call shredder. tell him we've acquired the tanker, and we're on our way, no problems encountered. hold that call. run them down. raph, get ready. for what. this. whoa. leo. you could've been a little more specific. where's the fun in that. get ready. chlorosulfonic acid. leo, i think i figured out shredder's plan. that acid reacts violently with water. so if he dumps it in the sewer it'll all be incinerated in seconds, including the lair. and splinter. we gotta stop them. donnie. you and raph stay with the van and save april. mikey, you're coming with me. we have to stop that tanker. uh, if you haven't noticed, i'm stuck with raph. no problem. well, that was fun. told ya. mikey, let's slow this thing down. fire grappling hooks. got it. donnie did say they weren't ready. i know. hold your breath, april. come on. let's club these feet. i think they're called foots. just hit 'em. nice shot. nice wheels. oh, well, i built them, you know. uhthey're not ready yet. whoa. is that all you got. i'd say that's a no. don't let him dump that acid. what'd donnie say about this stuff. mikey. throw the water balloon. uh, what water balloon. the one you were gonna hit me with. dude, you are good. nice shot, mioh. doctor prankenstein for the win. you had two. where do you keep them. eh, looks like we missed the fireworks. donnie, the gokart worked great. nice job. thanks, leo. and it's a patrol buggy. they defeated you with gokarts and a water balloon. i know it sounds absurd, but uh, it won't happen again, master, i promise you. if you break that promise i understand, master. nothing says victory like the sweet taste of pizza. this pizza smells kind of funky. where'd you get it. it's the one april threw out. what. we live in a sewer. now you're clean freaks. more for me. my sons. i owe you my gratitude and an apology. an apology. fear clouded your minds. however, it was not the shredder who fueled that fear, but me. you overcame that fear, and performed admirably. no training today yes. yeah. yes. yeah. unless michelangelo throws that balloon. you are so gonna get it. )
