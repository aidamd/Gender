1  it's been weeks since we saved earth and stopped the black hole generator. things have finally been cooling down. no more triceratons. no more kraang. and best of all, no more shredder and his goons. they've completely disappeared from the city. so tonight, the night of the full moon, master splinter is performing a very special initiation.  april o'neil  this tanto represents the dragon: strong, fierce, intelligent. a dragon not only relies on its physical strength, but its keen intellect as well.  be at one in spirit and body. be like the dragon.  april o'neil, you are now a kunoichi of the hamato clan. all right. yeah.  all right. oh, yeah, celebration time. congrats, april. you deserve it. you did great. thanks, guys. you're the best.   cowabunga.  teenage mutant ninja turtles

teenage mutant ninja turtles teenage mutant ninja turtles teenage mutant ninja turtles heroes in a half shell, turtle power  oh, man, remember when i had a hard time keeping up with you guys.  can't believe i'm finally a fullfledged ninja. sure, you made it to the third dan, but there's still seven more grades, each with different levels, so don't rain on her ninja parade, raph. it's amazing you made it to kunoichi, april. ignore everything raph just said. yeah, i always do. makes life way simpler.   come on, ninjas. let's call it a night. let go.   it hurts.  bro.   city's quiet. for now. i'm sure that'll change soon. with shredder gone, there's gonna be a ton of gangsters and super villains moving in on his turf. you okay, april. what's wrong. i'm pretty certain someone is following us.    what.  aww, look at you. coochie woochie woochie.  okay, this is weird.  um, hello. whoa. let's play a game. give me one of your weapons or i'll take something precious your shells. all right, sister, play time's over.     my name is shinigami. do you know what my name means.    i can't believe you'd hit a lady.    so you really are real, living, breathing kappa. so cute.  you ain't so bad yourself.      my sensei doesn't need a turtle weapon. your tessen will do just fine. you're gonna have to get it from me, witch.     a dragon tanto. you must have just become a kunoichi. this will do nicely.  i can't believe that crazy girl took us to school on a sunday. she just threw us off. now we know her tricks. i don't know, she was pretty awesome. yeah, awesome.  i mean, getting my butt kicked the night i become a kunoichi. it's like the whole universe is saying it's not meant to be. that is not the universe speaking. that is the selfdoubt of april o'neil speaking. i've been there, april. doubting everything, it's poison. believe in yourself. i just feel like a failure. there is no such thing as failure until you give up. that is when you fail. thank you, both.  you must uncover the identity and allegiance of this new assassin. claiming your weapon as a prize, that is an initiation into a ninja clan. be warned. it seems this new assassin may be working for the shredder.    hmm, i'm not coming up with anyone called shinigami in any of the international crime databases. you got anything at all, donnie. well, the shinigami are powerful gods in japanese myth that bring death and destruction. so we got something in common. this girl is super cute, guys. maybe we could turn her to the light side. we gotta find her first. let's split up and see if we can track her. maybe we can draw her out.   no sign of any activity. got anything, donnie. still searching. nothing so far. got anything, raph. i got nada. streets are clean. what do you got, mikey. mmm. i got pizza. mmm, mmm. what about you, april. april.  leo, i just spotted shinigami. i had a weird vibe that something was happening at shredder's old lair. shredder's back. but the lair was abandoned. not anymore. call the rest of the guys. don't do anything until we get there. thanks for the vote of confidence.      is that shredder. karai. karai, i bring you the redhaired girl's tanto blade. so splinter finally made april a kunoichi. kind of a shock. wha   yes, she seems so frail and clumsy when you first look at her. like a silly red bird.  well, this kunoichi tracked your butt down, karai. what're you doing, anyway. none of your business. just go. we'd like to know what's going on here too. leo, calm down. the brain worm that was controlling me is gone. i'm not your enemy. oh. so then why did your crazy friend attack us. it was only a test to see her skills. shinigami's an old friend from japan. she was never gonna hurt you. at least not permanently.  she's telling the truth. that brain worm thing is gone. they're not after us. they're after shredder. so what's up with the headgear, princess. daddy issues. i wanna rebuild the foot. bring back honor to a clan that shredder poisoned for almost two decades. and when i finish, i'll destroy oroku saki and his empire once and for all. life isn't about revenge, sis. come back to the lair with us. master splinter would love to see you. no. i have to carve out my own destiny. fine, we're leaving. first, i want my tanto back. now. hmm, if you want it back, take it from her. i mean, shouldn't be hard for a kunoichi, right. fine by me. i wanted a rematch anyway.      why you little         i'm stopping this ri let her fight her own battles.        little red bird.  all right, that's enough, shini. give her the tanto back.  easy, april. don't let that weirdo get to you. calm down. come on, this place is lame anyway. we're going to an awesome place. the sewers. booyakasha. neh. not only that, she's taken over shredder's old lair. she's even wearing a version of his helmet. this is most disconcerting, but her choices are her own.  april. what troubles you. i think i'm pretty much ready to revoke the kunoichi title, sensei. maybe i need more training. come. perhaps it is time i taught you an advanced move called "the dragon's tail. " i'll try anything.  dudes, you know what time it is, right. time for some chris bradford. boy.  i'm coming for you, destroyo, and nothing's gonna stop me. ha, accept my killer dolphins trained to eat human flesh. goodbye, chris bradford.  killer flesh.  killer dolphins. time to power up with chris bradford's roundhouse kick hyper drink.     killer flesh.    chris bradford's roundhouse kick hyper drink drink it.   is she still one of us, tiger claw.  no. the brain worm is gone. a martial arts store. what is she, shopping for nunchucks. it's a front. we store tons of illegal weapons in the back. she is here to raid us. the little cub has claws. foolish child, i can still see in the dark. so can i. i cannot, so this is kind of upsetting. tell your master i'm taking the city back, tiger claw. piece by piece.  where'd she go.  eh.     here kitty, kitty, kitty. what's this.             what.   i have claws too.  aah.    i like you, karai. let me finish you quick. tiger claw won't make things so easy for you. whatever, bradford. i plan on taking you all down.  karai. no, shini. surrender. now.   you win, tiger claw.   it's a text from karai. and it's just one word: "help. "    so now that we have them, what should we do with them. i vote eat them. you can never go wrong with eating them. no. we wait for their friends. karai called the turtles minutes ago.  you knew all along. do you take me for a fool.  there is no help for you.  where is shredder. where is that coward hiding. you do not get to make demands, girl. oh, no.   ay caramba.    clever girl. but cleverness only gets you so far.   take that brat down, tiger claw.    i always thought you were a spoiled, petulant child. this world will not mourn you when you are gone.  tiger claw.   always have to wait till the last minute, guys. tiger claw, i thought you and shredder left town. you know, after we defeated you and all. we will never leave until you and splinter are put to rest. team, take 'em down.          got you, rahzar. let's play "walk the dog". whoa, that's exactly what i was gonna say. we're, like, so similar, shinigami.   wha.   back off, fishface. ah, yes.  call me what you will. i am the most interesting fish in the world.   you're running low on nine lives, tiger claw.          you are beaten. your shell will hang in our new lair as a trophy. i don't think so.      wow, the dragon tail. right in the fur patch. booyakasha. i hate it when they do that.  eh. um, we are in trouble. run.  oh, no.   april. shini and i want to apologize. sorry about earlier. miwa. father. do not take on this burden of fighting the shredder alone. ally yourself with your family. let us help you. i've grown up, father. i need to rectify all the wrong deeds shredder has done my own way. you are just seeking vengeance. this anger you carry was inherited from oroku saki, not from me. i know. don't worry, father. i'll make you proud of me. soon. i am already proud of you, my daughter. april. you have proven yourself a true kunoichi. i always knew you had the dragon spirit, and apparently the dragon's tail as well. it's all thanks to you, sensei. so what now. we know shredder's still out there. i have a bad feeling things are about to take a turn for the worse.   i don't know if you can hear me, master, but karai she is trying to take control of the city, undo everything we have accomplished. she just destroyed our weapons cache, and i believe she's not going to stop there.   if it is a war she wants it is a war she will get.  )
