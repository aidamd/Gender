1    how are you feeling on this fine evening, master shredder.  i want my strength back, stockman. give me the rest of the mutagen. as your doctor and chief caregiver, i refuse.  this new mutagen formula is too unstable. the effects could be disastrous. you could mutate into a monster.  do it. or i will pluck off your limbs until you are nothing left but a buzzing head. oh, uh,  you're right, sir.  mutagen it is. who needs the slow, safe approach, anyway, right.    it it's working. it's  master.        i'll help you, sir. oh. aah.     teenage mutant ninja turtles teenage mutant ninja

he's one of a kind and you know just where to find him when it's party time master splinter taught them every single skill they need to be one lean mean green incredible team teenage mutant ninja turtles teenage mutant ninja turtles teenage mutant ninja turtles heroes in a half shell turtle power  focus. do not let your attention flitter away from you. all random thoughts are transitory, like dreams.  let them disappear. bask in the emptiness of the void.   that is enough for today.  really, sensei. cause we only meditated for, like, ten minutes.  yes. i am not feeling very well. are you okay, master splinter. you seem worried about something. my dream last night, it was very powerful. i fell into a vast pit, where i fought the shredder. my memory is hazy, but i did not survive. but it was nothing. just a dream. right, sensei. do not fret, my family. dreams are often symbolic, not literal. i am not going anywhere.  master shredder.  what have you done to him, you fool. this is what i desired. with this new body, splinter and his wretched turtles won't   i told you, sir. the mutagen formula is unstable. i need to finish the dosage. no. i am better. better than i've ever been. fetch bradford. it is time to bait a rat.  oh, man. i remember recording this. one of the top five episodes of all time, according to the fan sites. master shredder summons you, bradford.  oh, right at the good part. empire. stop, ninja commander. chris bradford is finally going to take down your cruel socialist empire. for truth, justice, and boatloads of cash money. you're so high and mighty, bradford. how about i chop you down with my buzzsaw blaster.  i'm going to kick your communist butt so hard it'll fly up and land on your head like a giant butt beret. that's right. actionkick. hiya.  aw, sensei. you're ruining our cartoonathon. we're missing the best part. no, the best part is when you get your lazy shells off the floor and do something. too much television is a poison that ruins both body and mind. we already cleaned our rooms and took out the trash. what do you  oh, great. now what. it's like the whole universe hates tv. i bet it's donnie messing with some kind of experiment. come on. i didn't do it. i'm checking the grid now.  there's a pretty big power outage over ten square blocks, all the way up to shredder's old lair.  karai. go. see if she is all right. hai, sensei. we're on it. meh, probably just a waste of time. goodbye, "bradford" marathon. shini. any word on the power outage. no, but it appears to be the entire neighborhood. suspicious. double the guards. send them out to cover both ends of the street. yes, karai. but i'm sure it's cool. it's just a power outage.   greetings, old friends. tiger claw and bradford. foolish move coming in here, freaks. oh, we thought this would be the perfect time for a family reunion.     you you've become everything you loathe. everything you hate. a mutant. my daughter, please. i did this for you. to destroy our enemy, the monster who took your mother's life. hamato yoshi. you're insane. you are the monster. you lie to yourself so much, you come to believe an entire dream. silence. i was there. i saw what happened. the night he took your mother's life. i saw it. i let's take this crazy akuma down. no. they are mine. foot clan, attack.       i'll destroy you, monster. for everything you have done to karai.     ah.      oh.  i will let your friend go as a gesture of my love. but if you struggle, i will hunt her down and crush her into pulp. understood.  move it, girl.     holy cheesy balls. is that some kind of shredder clone monster. no, mikey, i  i think it's the shredder himself. what do we do, leo. we ram him, obviously.    tell your master i have my daughter back. if he desires to see her one last time, come to where i last defeated him.      ah.  aah.    are you okay, april. ow. what happened. shredder, he used mutagen. he's turned into some kind of super shredder. he's got huge muscles and blades everywhere, like a buff cheese grater. he has her, sensei. miwa. he said he wants to meet you in the last place that he beat you. the sewers. then let us make haste.  xever. stockman. report. all is in readiness, master. good. keep an eye on them. make sure they follow the plan.  of course, master shredder. up ahead. it's not far. stay diligent. the shredder is clearly baiting us into a trap. i get the feeling we're being watched.  no one's inside. even so, be ready, ninja. what the heck is this. okay, this is weird. psycho is more like it.  gaze upon these images, rat. first you take tang shen away from me, and then you steal my daughter.   show yourself, saki.  oh, no. everyone look out. huh.    this way. hurry.   look. more freaky photos. huh. this is the same station. karai held us captive. remember. when she poisoned us. oh, man, this is totally horror movie style right here. what's next, a photo of splinter with his eyes xed out.  oh, snap. that's crazy, yo. you turned her against me. hm. you brainwashed her. karai is my daughter. how many lies can you tell yourself, saki. aah. just wait until i get free, shredder. karai. miwa.  sensei. sensei, hold up. splinter.  you guys hear something.  oh, no.      oh, no. mikey.      father.  it's a trap. i will not leave you. behind you.     saki. what have you done. i have molded myself into perfection, rat man. look upon me, and know fear. you must be proud. you are finally a monster, both inside and out. i want her to see you fall. then, finally, your brainwashing will disappear, and she will remember that it was i who raised her, it was i who made her who she is. i sacrificed everything for her. out of absolute love. father is right. your transformation into a monster is complete.    ha. hm.         i've always wanted to see a turtle without its shell. you wanna see me naked. weirdo. down, boy.   sorry, no ticket.    ah, ah.     stupid cat.    aah.     good riddance, brat. raph. huh.  huh.        dead end.       leo. thanks, raph. come on. we gotta move.   you are deranged, saki.  but i can help you. we can end this fight.  now that i am your master, you'll do anything to stop this.     it is time my revenge comes to fruition.    coward. face me.     i'm on my way.  karai. guys, the shredder, he's just too powerful. splinter couldn't even fight him. we saw what shredder's become. what if we can't stop him. it's gonna be, like, weeks before my latest batch of retromutagen is ready. i can sense him, somewhere, deep underground. i think i can track him. great. then let's head down and kick some bladed freak butt.  whoa. well, that's not terrifying or anything.  um, leo, you have a plan.    splinter. splinter, i know you're here.  it's not just muscle and blades the mutagen gave me. i can hear you. i can smell you. can you smell a rock.    come out. face me like a man.   so you do not fear me. you were leading me into your own kind of trap.   fight me.   a pity miwa is not here to see  how evil you truly have become.    these guys are tough.  back off of me, chrome domes.  hah.      i've got a fix on splinter. he's in the undercity. that's where he fought the rat king. come on, i know a shortcut.    now, finally, my nightmares of your proud, leering, loathsome face will finally end. finish me, yes. but miwa will live on. my daughter. mine.   what. what is happening to me.   saki. the mutagen. it is unstable. out of control. be silent, rat. super shredder's kicking sensei's tail in. come on. father.  you must listen, saki.  i need nothing from you.    oh, no.      you will die. and then all of your loved ones.   sensei.  saki, we die together. father. no.  everybody move.  he has to be alive, right. that drop is at least 1,000 feet down. even he couldn't survive a fall like that. we have to keep going. for splinter. aah. oh, sewer apples.  )
