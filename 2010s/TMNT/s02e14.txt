"he who runs his mouth gets a face full of nunchaku. " they say that in japan. they would if you were there. still, your heart is in the right place. perhaps it is time she knew the truth. maybe you should tell the other guys, sensei. this is difficult, but it is time you all knew the truth. the child i thought i had lost in the fire, miwa, is karai, my daughter.  fury became flame, and flame darkened the world with smoke.  and in that darkness, shredder stole miwa away.  i thought she had perished, but she was raised by shredder as his daughter and trained as a deadly foot assassin. wait. tthis can't be. it's some kind of joke, right, sensei. karai's our sister. sensei, she's still our enemy. she was raised by shredder. yeah. how can we ever trust her. there is good in her. i know this. the truth must be told, and it too will be an earthquake.  father should've been back hours ago with his new little secret weapon. i've heard rumors it's a new mutant part woman, part tuna all lover. i hope not. i'm allergic to fish. nothing personal, xever. all i know is that he's a deadly assassin. the crying turned him into a mutant when he was a kid decades ago. father. master shredder. you look terrible, bradford. i have returned, and i bring with me the most feared assassin in all of asia.   tiger claw.  this is your secret weapon, father another freak.  this is the foot clan you promised me. i must say, master shredder, i am disappointed.   i honor you, great tiger claw. can i offer you some refreshments. milk, skim. sensitive subject maybe but shouldn't tigers have tails. don't mock me, child. it was a rival who sliced off my tail. one day i will find it, and he will pay the price.  if you can't keep your own tail silence, karai. you will treat tiger claw with utmost respect. he is my new second in command. what. i've earned that job, not some oversized cat in a scarf. enough. tiger claw, take my daughter with you to capture splinter and his turtles. karai, do not disobey him.  so, april, vigilanteing is cool and all, but how about a real date. what do you call this. i was thinking, you know, maybe something a little cozier. you, me  the kraang. nah, aliens would just mess up my mix. there's so many of them. so these are the robots you told me about. with the little brains inside, yeah. what are they doing. that's a new trick. i got this, red. stay here.  ugh.    when you play cricket, you got to have some crumpets.  wow. let's take this to donnie, let him check it out. why not take it to a real laboratory. trust me, donnie's way ahead of most scientists. come on. and then you press this button and portable portal. wow. the kraang are always one step ahead. i wonder if this is what's behind the earthquakes. we're gonna have to test it. i don't know, donnie. you think that's a good idea. if you turtles are gonna be slow about it, i'm going. you're crazy. nuts. out of your gourd. i'm going first.  raph. come on, red. aah. april, wait for me. can't let them go alone, dude.   mikey. ah.   okay. this is weird. wow. it's like the grand central station of dimensional travel. the kraang must use it as a gateway between realities. guys, the door's gone. we're trapped. there's thousands of doors. everyone, start searching for a way home. whoa. look at this, april. amazing. it's so beautiful. check this out, red.  it's us. why do we look like dorks. is that supposed to be april. nice jumpsuit. guys, look. i think it's dimension "x. " home of the kraang. this place is making my brain melt. shh. ii sense something coming. oh, no. how do you close the door. where's the the knob. where's the knob. they're onto us. get ready, team.  biotroids, destroy.    april. thanks, d.  it was nothing. look out. whoa.    ugh. casey jones shoots  he scores. ugh.    here it comes. look out.  guys, let's follow 'em. they're gone. we got to get that remote.   butt cannons. run.    guys, what dimension are we in. aah. the others are trapped over there. yeah, and the smart member of the team is trapped with them. this is your fault, leo. if you hadn't gotten us  all: whoa. we got to find the source of these quakes. karai, you have your instructions.  who the heck is that. you may call me tiger claw. i knew it. i was totally gonna name him tiger claw. i ask only once. summon your rat master. sorry, pal. i'm not a cat person.  raph.  ooh.  you are nothing but cubs.  ha ha. nice kitty. uh, let me see if i have some catnip on me. ha ha.  come on, bros, we got to get to high ground.  out of my way, don. i got this.   that was too close. all right, donnie. how do we get out of here. you're the expert, gaptooth. gaptooth. look in the mirror lately, cavemouth. guys, stop. check this out. wow. it looks like another part of dimension "x. " ugh. what is that. kraang is aware of spies in that doorway where kraang is not but soon will be. i think we're in serious trouble.  don't tell me oh, great. surrender is optimum. nonsurrender means disintegration, which is less optimum.  for now. play along. for the record, i don't count this as a surrender.      mikey.     you are defeated. summon your master, or the little one goes into the furnace. don't do it, leo.  it's a trap for splinter. of course it's a trap. tell me the part where i have a choice.  the cheese phone. truly an emergency. moshi moshi.  leonardo. what is the problem. do not fear, my son. i am on my way. i can't believe you called him. if anything happens, to splinter what else could i do, raph. the rat. where is he. one push and you all go into the furnace. just wait, tiger claw. splinter's gonna kick that little stub of a tail so deep in your striped silence. i am tired of waiting. your lives end now.  this is it. i love you guys. raph, it was me who ate your last piece of chocolate pepperoni pizza. i'm sorry, man. i was so hungry.  release my sons.  now.  hmm.     i prefer to slice you into bitesized pieces.   you will continue marching from the place you are to the place you are not yet. at least we're back in new york. didn't they mention feeding us something. i'm hungry. no, they said they'd feed us to something, something called a kraathatrogon which is actually, i have no clue what it is. we can wait around to be eaten or we can make a move.   let's go. this way. go. move.  wow. the old pneumatic subway. built in the 1800s nobody uses 'em now.  what's gross slobbering sound. it sounds worse than mikey eating pizza.  ooh, those must be the kraathatrogons. the kraathatr trogo the tro "space worms" is easier to pronounce.   it's the worms. that's what's causing the earthquakes. wwhy. why bring 'em here. look. they're milking them for mutagen. by darwin's beard. this is where the mutagen comes from. fascinating and disgusting.  stop that. stop what.  i'm serious, casey. i said stop.  huh.     kraang, we have been discovered in the place that was meant to be undiscovered. unleash the kraathatrogon.    i don't think i have a big enough hockey stick for that thing.    you'll pay for that, rodent.   now you are defenseless. a ninja is never defenseless.  you got him, sensei. slap the stripes off that cat.  you will not trip me up so easily.    and now we shall see if a cat always lands on its feet. no. hmm.  ha. you lose, rat. miwa.  karai. karai, don't do this. splinter he's your father, your true father. liar. you'd say anything to save him. no, i swear it. he's your father hamato yoshi. if you won't be silent i'll silence you. if you won't be silent i'll silence you.  what.  master shredder desires them alive. he wants the pleasure of finishing the turtles himself. fine. let's deal with the rat first. leave him alone, karai. or you're gonna answer to me. my sons, go. now.  ah. run.  splinter. we got to come back for him, leo.  move. don't let them escape.   at least we still have the rat.    run. faster.       we got to slow it down. i'm on it. casey, no. eat this.   yes.  no. casey, hurry.  april. grab on.  jones. the staff.    aah. no. casey. he's gone. he's gone. i'm so sorry, april. i truly am. ow. ow, ow. ow. this your fault, leo. if you hadn't called splinter, we wouldn't be in this mess. i didn't have a choice, raph. it was him or mikey. i thought i thought sensei would take care of him. well, you thought wrong. we know where they took him shredder's lair. we do this for splinter. there comes a time, brothers, when history is forged like melted cheese. it sticks together as one. but is still soft and squishy in the middle. mm. are you with me. lamest speech ever. but i'm with you. let's do this.   okay. coast is clear. this is so terrible. poor casey. we have to find a way to stop those kraang worms once and for  you're right about that. and we know one man who knows more about the kraang than anyone. great caesar's ghost. quick. get in before you're spotted. this is about the earthquake situation, isn't it. you're never gonna guess what's causing it, mr. kurtzman. call me jack. i named the kraang's little scheme  the manhattan project.  wake up, little rat. nice work, tiger claw. you finally captured the great splinter. so is the poison going to finish him or what. most men would have expired by now, but it's only weakened him. he may be small, but he's tough as iron.  bradford, xever, leave us. hamato yoshi, so you have come to this a wretched rat man waiting to be put out of his misery. at least i do not wear a mask, hiding what little humanity i have left. it is because of you that i wear this mask. all these years you continue to deceive yourself and everyone around you. you dare. now it ends.  no, father. you would stop me. you'd kill your greatest enemy while he's poisoned and chained. what about honor. everything you've taught me. the girl is right, master shredder. hmm. very well. gather the foot. i will offer hamato yoshi one last fight. why did you help me. i don't know. maybe because you look so pathetic.  you have your mother's spirit so fierce, and yet so scared. never speak of my mother again. you ruined my family. you ruined all of our lives. no, it was oroku saki. oroku saki. so these worms are only children. how big are the adults. huge. some are hundreds of feet long. the kraang had been importing the worms from dimension "x" to suck out their mutagen. it's kind of like milking a giant cow. okay, okay. we get it. thanks. so how do we stop them. no clue how to stop 'em. but i know the kraang ride these puppies. you see these antennae on its head. they pull 'em like the reins on a horse. gross. why didn't i think of it before. salt. salt. what do you  hold on a sec. it it's casey. casey. uh, hey, april. uh, so i'm kind of, uh, trapped inside this giant worm thing. it's cool. i'm alive and stuff. you're inside the worm. you get a signal in there. yeah, it's, uh, trying to digest me, ii think. could use, uh, a little help. aghh. sit tight, casey. i mean, um, don't go anywhere. he's alive. he's alive.  sensei. sensei. leonardo, go now. huh.  hello, again, my friend.    let me go. i knew you'd come to us, leo. where are the other turtles.  it's just him, master shredder. he's alone. i sense no one else. watch, turtle, for it will be the last fight you ever see.  the destruction of your master, hamato yoshi.   you can do it, sensei.  sensei.  fight me.   pathetic. i will put you out of your misery.    no. oh, yeah. rescue time.  come on, master splinter. get them. rahhh. no. master shredder. ugh. do not let them escape, fools. go.  faster, guys. you were foolish to come for me. we'd never leave you, sensei. this is it. this is the tunnel. great. now what. i'm creating a vibration that'll attract the worm.  you really think a stick is gonna attract    the satchel. salt. salt's ionic strength can burn through a worm's neurosectory cells. it's like acid. yeah, but salt.  yah.  yah.  uh, donnie. we're out. no, wait.   huh.   ugh. anybody have any hand sanitizer. april. casey. ugh.  i hate to break up the reunion, but we have big, huge, giant problems.   now, that's a big worm.  i smell the reptiles. if they escape, shredder will have all your hides.  and what about yours, karai.  i need to rest. must get the poison out of my system. just drink some water, sensei. must meditate.  let him rest. we'll keep a lookout for those goons.     found 'em. attack.  fancy new weapon, fishface. let's see you use it. i'm going to chop you into tiny chunks and feed you to my piranha.  too slow, rahzar. ah. hyah.  your skills are nothing compared to mine.  you are still just a cub.     okay, here's the plan. i reverse the polarity of the portal and keep that thing from getting in. you guys create a diversion. what kind of diversion. leave that to casey jones.  yo. alien freakjob. it is humans known as humans.  i hope you have a plan other than getting shot at, jones.     now it is time to end this. sensei.  are you ready, my sons. all: yeah. eat it, alien scum. this is so cool. whoo. kraang detects inferior weaponry.      what the. oh, yeah. you like that, son. kraang, unleash another kraathatrogon.     karai, i don't want to fight you anymore. i'm not your enemy.     karai.  no.  you're not going anywhere. look out.  i've got an idea, something that kurtzman said.     come on, jones. ugh. hiyah. move it, girl.  go, worm, go. we'll distract the kraang. do your thing, donnie. i don't believe it. whoa. to the surface, wormie. you are mine now, yoshisan. aah. who dares.    not too shabby.  whoohoo. yes.      i got to reverse the polarity.   work. why won't you work.  ha. i did it. i rule.           you did it, donnie. you saved the city.  i'm gonna take back everything i said about you, donnie. you rule. so the earthquakes were caused by giant worms that lived under the sewers. that sounds worse than giant cockroaches. well, i'm stoked you guys are back. come here.  we're glad to be back, trust me. you did it, sensei. with the help of my brave sons, yes, we all did it. but what about karai. i still can't believe that evil witch is your daughter. um, sorry to be so honest. perhaps one day she will believe the truth. but that is her decision. for now, we celebrate. yeah. time for some antonio's. so where do you think that kraang worm went anyway.    hey, do you guys see that. whoa, dudes. a giant freaky worm. totally mondo bizarro.  i bet that pesky shredder and kraang are behind this. you know what that means, right, leonardo. we take down the creepy crawler, and then we order pizza. yes. turtle power. cowabunga. )
