turtles heroes in a half shell, turtle power where the heck did it come from. talking food. what are you talking about. huh. my dues, my bros, my turts. it's that time again. our series is winding down. the end of a season, the final episode of "chris bradford and his 2ruff krew".    evil ninja commander is on the roof. come on, 2ruff krew. ugh. heavens to murgatroyd. i can't make it, don'tcha know. i'm just too exhaustipated. even me, master p, is too tired. go on without us, chris. oh, i can't make it either. hop on my back, lil' rineo. we've got a villain to stop.  lil' rineo is gone. ahha. evil ninja commander.  foolish bradford. it was i all along. i am lil' rineo. oh.    why, you evil, senseless beast. hiya.   that's right, kids. evil never wins, but chris bradford's new crunchy chris bradford bran flakes always wins. buy 'em. hiya. ugh. huh. huh. master splinter. hmm. you've been kind of distant the past few days. you've been meditating nonstop and you're barely sleeping. are you okay. leonardo, my son, please. let us not talk about me. let's talk about you. do you know why you are leader of this team. um, yeah, because i asked to be. you said it wasn't because of my skills. i said that only to temper your ego at the time. i knew even when you were a small boy that you would one day grow up to be the leader of this team, and when i pass on to be like a father as well. pass on. what are you talking about, sensei. leonardo, if i can only impart one piece of wisdom that will remain with you forever, remember, giving guidance to your brothers and friends does not come from here. it comes from here. i don't get it. you you're fine, father. is there something you're not telling me. hey leo, want to go visit karai. party at the mutanimals' crib, yo. and you can come too, sensei. hmm, perhaps i do need to get out of the sewers for a time.  yeah. yeah.  yeah. check out my new sweet fighting style, shini. whew. now attack doctor rockwell. oh, indeed, an incredibly dangerous adversary. egad, i can barely defend myself.  hold on there, monkey brains.  shini placed trackers on two footbots. we found that they both went to this spot, 20 miles north of new york city, here. we should summon our turtle allies and form a plan of attack. my thoughts exactly. in the meantime, we'll be safe here. we've got this place on lockdown. thanks for letting us stay, slash.   um, is anyone actually watching the monitors. mutanimals, prepare for battle. leatherhead, man the defenses. rockwell, ready the weapons.    karai. you ain't touching her. shredder.  that's superheated plasma. impossible. you don't know what kind of simian you're dealing with.  uh, maybe i'll wait this one out. leave my friends alone. aaah.  i am here to destroy you all.  hyah. aah.  stop this madness, shredder. we'll all die here. it is fitting that you perish just as your mother perished. ugh. yah. hyah. ah. aaah.   hurry, leo.  miwa. miwa. oh, no.  splinter, is she.    karai. you saved her, leonardo. shredder doesn't care about using karai as bait anymore. he wants us all dead.  the ambulances are coming. can you wait with her, shinigami.  i see two clear trails leading off in opposite directions. raphael, april, casey, and slash will come with me. leonardo, you will lead donatello, michelangelo, and leatherhead in that direction. take the shellraiser. the rest of us will travel on foot. sensei, that's not a good idea. we should all stick together if we're going to take shredder down. leonardo, remember what i said earlier in the dojo. from your heart.  leo, we got to hurry before the trail runs cold. guys, zooming in. i got bebop and rocksteady's van on camera two blocks ahead.  oh, feels good to stretch.     turtles, come out and play. remember when i said that. because it's throwback thursday, fools. da, we be throwing you all the way back to last thursdays.  shut up, rock, i'm trying to intimidate them. you're going down, turtle fools. it's a misslegoround. coward. attack me from behind, will you. ah. ha. whoo hoo. this is your swan song, tartarugas. tonight, you all fall. the shredder. he is atop that building. that's where we fought for the first time. and that's where we take him down once and for all.  so why couldn't we take the elevator. at least me and april. feels like my legs are disconnected from my body. quiet, shredder is near.  oh, man, i sense it. he's close. hamato yoshi. at last, my nightmares will end, for tonight, you will finally perish. indeed, i will end your nightmares, saki. permanently. aah. ah. uh. aah. aaahhh. goongala. aah. casey. aaah.   aah.   your weakness is that you care about others. i have torn all weaknesses away and become allpowerful. hm. aah. whoa. you want to get funky fresh with me. whoohoo.  wha. stay down, leonardo. aah.  leatherhead. guys, we did it. we beat 'em. whoo hoo.  oh, no, we didn't beat them. this was all a distraction to split us up.  donnie, we need backup. raph is hurt. super shredder's too strong. where are you. the wolf building rooftop. please, we need you. super shredder is  april. there's no time. let's go.    aah.    there's the building. hope we're not too late. splinter. aaah. is this how you choose to die, brother. lying on your belly like an animal.  come, saki. end this madness. ah.   yes. you did it, sensei. my family. aaah. oh, no. splinter.  father. splinter.  and now, hamato yoshi dies. no. father. father. i have claimed my victory. no more will you haunt me, rat.  aaah.  oops. no, please.   papa.   )
