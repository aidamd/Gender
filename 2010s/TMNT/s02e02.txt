2x02 invasion of the squirrelanoids   take a right no, left. left.  um, donnie, maybe you can tell me before we pass the street. i'm sorry, leo. there's still so many mutagen canisters out there, my tracker is having trouble zeroing in on a single reading. oh, turn right.  whoa, i think i just got shelllash.  hey, mikey. you want to stop reading your comics and pay attention to the mission.  hey. that comic's in mint ah. near mint condition. don't mess it up. great. another horror story. guess who's gonna be up all night again. what. no. i was up all night 'cause i was polishing my grappling hook. right. seriously, mikey, what are those horror comics good for other than freaking you out and  got one. stop here.    my ooze specs are picking up a mutagen trail. come on.  remember, this might be another trap, so we need to be careful.  ehhehheh. some ninja. guys, over here. it's half empty, but one more mutagen canister recovered.  it wasn't me.    why's that dude afraid of a cute, tiny little squirrel.  all:    now can i scream in horror. dudes, this is a terrible idea. this is exactly how the alien got onto the ship in my comic book. maybe mikey's right. both: what. i mean, the comic book thing is totally crazy, but i can think of a million other reasons it's a bad idea to take this guy back to the lair, starting with splinter. raph, that squirrel was clearly a mutant creature, which means this is our fault. and our responsibility to fix it. i'll deal with master splinter, let me explain. indeed. please explain the reason you have brought a complete stranger into our secret, hidden lair. oh, you'll laugh your whiskers off when you hear this one.  it's pretty good.  careful with the specimen. i want to run some tests on him. take it easy, boys. easy d'oh.  so want to guess the first thing the crew did when they brought the guy back on the spaceship in my comic. enough with the comic already. you're makin' me loopy. great. now it went from "near mint" to "totally messed up. " okay, we're cool, but let's try to get this guy out of here before master splinter is done meditating. where are we at, donnie. running an internal scan right now to see if yep, still in there. whoa. wait. does it have two heads. all right, guys. if you need me, i'll be beating leo's high score in pinball. pink eye, red eye. the ham went flying. wootwoot. i think that freaky squirrel made him a little nutty. dudes, i got this. i can totally translate crazy. gimme a hootenanny he's saying, "the squirrel licked some ooze and transformed into a mutant. it's been chasing me for days now, but i'm totally okay. " if by "okay", you mean "totally insane. " well, at least no one will believe a crazy guy if he talks about giant ninja turtles living in a sewer.     this this is unprecedented. the squirrels replicate inside a host. they divided like a singlecelled organism. that's exactly what happened in my comic. well, not exactly. they exploded out of the dude's butt. agh. leprechauns. i'll show our friend to the door.   we need to catch them. they're emitting dangerous amounts of energy. move very slowly. we don't want to startle 'em. steady steady  ahhhh. get 'em.  hey. get back here.  hey. whoa. watch my stuff. i got you, little freak. well, our friend's gone, but we still have plenty of crazy. there they go.   quick. help me seal off the lair. we can't let 'em escape. well, i don't exactly want 'em in here with us. get back here, you little nutlover.    wahha. huh. yeh. wah.   huh.  get off. not my room. the dojo.    sensei's in a deep trance. shh. full ninja mode.   jeez, mikey. when's the last time you cleaned. and since when did you start wearing tightywhities. that, my friend, is a story for another day. let's just focus on the squirrels, comprende. oh, sweet. awesome idea. i just impressed myself. here, squirrely, squirrely squirrel. come get it.  here you go, squirrel.  have a tiny bite.  where is that little sucker. oh.  what is going on in here. i was in a deep meditative trance, trying to block out your constant noise, and is that a chipmunk. uh, it's, um, a squirrel, sensei. a dangerous mutant squirrel that reproduces inside stomachs. i should have been in a deeper trance. you will be safe here for a short time, my distant cousin, until we can find out more about you. this pizza is the best. ha. fourdayold pepperoni, jelly bean, and maple syrup. wait. what were we supposed to be doing again.   the squirrel. there you are.  raph. that was my limited edition actionkick unicorn man. there's the little creepster.  huh.  it's in my guts. i can feel it in there, munching on that popcorn i ate. it's freakin' me out, man. okay, you got to stop with the this, because i can't hear what's going on inside your intestines. oh, i'll tell you what's going on in there. let me see. oh, yeah. right now the mutant squirrel is probably secreting a mucus into your stomach lining so that when it multiplies ugh. mikey, not helping. though probably 98% accurate. get 'em out, get 'em out, get em out. just as i thought. we need to perform surgery, stat. nurse.  let me out of here.  fooled you. why you, you, you  raph, are you bros, brace for grossness.    donnie. donnie. some sciencey stuff would be a big help right now.  glowing. glowing's bad. glowing is real bad. i see it's happening here as well. these things are putting out a crazy energy signature. it's messing with my analyzer. we're doomed. doomed, i tell you.   split up and search each room. split up. clearly you don't read comics either, sensei, 'cause splitting up is the silence. you are trained warriors. we will find these creatures. now. split up to search in the dark for multiplying mutants. could we pick a more clich way to get eaten. one of us could twist our ankle, or our tphones could die or okay, move.   what are you doing. i told you i'd check the bedrooms. i thought you'd need back up.   there was a sound just like that in my comic when the baby aliens transformed into giant alienoids. wait, you read it in a comic. how can it sound the same. sweet mother of mutations. they've turned into into squirrelanoids.   oh, no. leo, they're here.   whoa. they're gonna brainsuck us. gah.   thump.   the sewers lead to the surface. if those things get out go then, quickly. i will stay to defend the lair, in case the beasts double back. which means we have to go after them alone. in the dark sewer. without you. who among you wants to prove you are the bravest. the strongest of will. the worthiest of ninjas.  master splinter, i'd say there's some kind of lesson here like, i don't know, "brains over bravery" or something. i'd say the "something" part is most accurate. uh, hmm hmm i'm not gonna say this happened in my comic, but this happened in my comic.  what was that.  there's one.   metalhead.  page 33. oh, man. don't worry, little pal. i'll make you all better. i do not want to say i was right, but i was right.   just throwing this out there. what are we supposed to do when we find these squirrelanoid monsters. don't worry. they'll find us. you always know just the right thing to say. i'm picking up strong readings from both tunnels. then we split up. again. didn't you guys get but this time in teams, okay. it's still splitting up. we're toast. game over, man. game over. this way, donnie. sure, you take the guy with the tracking device. come on, mikey. so, uh, how did they defeat the aliens in your comic book. oh, so now you want to know. well, first the aliens picked off the crew in the dark, onebyone, sucking their faces off until there was only one remaining survivor. sorry i asked.  wait. did you hear that.  yeah. yeah, i heard it. over there.      i don't see anything.  ahhh. donnie.   heads or tails. heads.   oh, no. donnie, move.  move.  aghhhh. whoa.    they'll crack our shells like nuts. then we might as well go down in a blaze of glory. all: hyaaaa.      zing. zing.   hyah.   d'oh.  all right, mikey, i'm in. how does the sole survivor beat the aliens. it was so awesome. he baited the alien into an air lock, and then he ooh. hyah. hoo. did he just bail on us. i think he's got a plan.  hyah.          yoohoo, glow heads.  mm want some.  mikey has a plan.     uh, come and get it.     booyakasha.  aaaah. aaah.   i gotcha. we all do.      phew. the septic tanks down below should hold those creeps. at least until i can figure out a retromutagen to turn 'em back. i'm glad you didn't get flushed, little brother. you and me both, bro. i hate to admit it, but it looks like all of mikey's comic book reading paid off. and that was pretty clever to realize that squirrelanoids were attracted to the scent of food. actually, that was pretty obvious. i can't believe i didn't think of it. not everyone can be the brains of the outfit.  and have any of you considered, what if one of those creatures manages to escape. no worries, sensei. those giant nutloving freaks are gone for good. um, actually a bunch of sequel comics came out. the aliens come back.  hmm. popcorn.  not bad. little chewie.  )
