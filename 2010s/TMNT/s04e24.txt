1 we must continue the search for karai. she is out there somewhere. i do not think she is with the turtles. she and shinigami have often been spotted alone. we must not waste any more time. now is the ah. ah. master. stockman is on the verge of stabilizing me. he has been saying that for months. i will soon be ready to face splinter again. but for now, i want the turtles.     heehee. what are

ninja turtles teenage mutant ninja turtles teenage mutant ninja turtles heroes in a half shell, turtle power here we go, it's the lean, green ninja team on the scene, cool teens doing ninja things so extreme, out the sewer like laser beams get rocked with the shellshocked pizza kings can't stop these radical dudes the secret of the ooze made the chosen few emerge from the shadows to make their move the good guys win, and the bad guys lose  leonardo's the leader in blue does anything it takes to get his ninjas through donatello is the fellow, has a way with machines raphael's got the most attitude on the team michelangelo, he's one of a kind and you know just where to find him when it's party time master splinter taught 'em every single skill they need to be one lean, mean, green, incredible team teenage mutant ninja turtles teenage mutant ninja turtles teenage mutant ninja turtles heroes in a half shell, turtle power master, i think you forgot your sword. perhaps i don't need a sword.    oh.  goongala.  both: ah. hm. ah. ah.  whoa uh. yah. wha.  hm. mm   ew. ah. hoo. hoohoo. wha.  aha. huh.  oh.  huh. ah. ah.  huh. oh. ah.  hmm.  ah. whoa.  yah. ah.  ah.  ah. oh. yeah.  ah  unorthodox methods may sometimes be necessary in order to defeat the enemy. yet you should also be prepared for your enemy to do the same. therefore, you all must learn to hone your intuition.  leonardo and michelangelo have the strongest ability to sharpen their intuition. anger clouds too much of raphael's foresight. donatello's too grounded in his rational mind. only april's is near perfection. casey, your intuition is basically 0. 0. casey jones is a born warrior. i got tons of intuition, yo. ah. did you intuit that.  now you have graduated to the next dan. there is nothing to give you, only wisdom: listen to the silent part of yourself, which was never born into the world. whoa. that is deep, yo. see, raph, i got insight into that knowledge splinter just dropped 'cause i'm more spiritual than you.  april.   april.  what happened. i i had a premonition of some kind. there were these twin blades. casey, you need to be careful. very careful. casey jones doesn't do careful.   your power levels are augmented, but definitely not as powerful as they were when you had the crystal. you up for patrol, april. we're searching for any new leads to help find super shredder's secret lair. i'm good to go. all right. raph, you're with casey. mikey, with me. april, with donnie. aww.  we should swing by the mighty mutanimals and check in with karai. i still don't get why karai doesn't stay with us in the sewers. karai's not a kid anymore. she wants her independence. i get that. or it could be the smell. you're either born into the sewer life, or you're not.  picking up something up ahead moving fast oh, no missile.  whoa. holy chipotle. raph, casey, unknown fastmoving object heading your way. whoa. ah. donnie, april, lock on my tphone signal and get over here now. turtle hunt's not happening, t. c. how 'bout some tunes. i just made a dope mixtape. ooh, da. is funky fresh beats. listen to this.  rhino rocksteady. rrrepresent.   will you two morons be quiet.   you all good in the mutant hood, tiger claw. just drive. and shut up.   drop the blades, sweetheart. my name is alopex, turtle boy. ha ha. turtle boy. it's raphael. now put 'em down. well, raphael, allow me to give you a history lesson on the blades of vengeance. centuries ago, they were owned by twin sisters. they used them against an evil warlord who had slain their family. the blades cursed any man who was even scratched by their steel.  put 'em back or face justice.  lame. goongala.  what the heck. looking for this. whoa.   what is all of this junk. that's it.  ah. ha ha. filthy normal.  whoa.  ah ha. ah.  huh. ah.  ah.  he's here.  oh, man. that smarts. tiger claw. alopex. you hang my tail like a trophy. i'm going to remove your head next.     ah. ah.   peekaboo, i see you. heehee.  ooh, yeah. heehee. whoa.  ah  hold still, foxy. ooh. oh. ah. ah. heehee.   ah. ah i'll be back for you, tiger claw. and i will be waiting, alopex.   both: huh. hang on.  ah. oh.  what the heck was that. mutant fox, dude. her name is alopex. casey, what happened. i got cut by one of those blades she stole, but it's nothing, yo. barely a scratch. you've got to be more careful. ha, i didn't know you cared, red. casey. whew. thanks, raph. that was close. yeah. too close. this is gonna take a while. alopex literally blew us off the road.  that alopex is really something, chompy. but she's no mona lisa. so check it out: the twin blades alopex stole really are said to be cursed. but it doesn't say what the curse is. because they are only known to ninja. these are the cursed blades of vengeance. a person wounded by them, even the smallest cut, will be cursed to fatal misfortune. death curse. for real. that's redonkulous. i don't think so. casey, this may sound weird, but your aura. it's just all kinds of wrong. huh. ah. whoa. it's the curse, dude. i don't i don't believe in curses. sure, ancient chinese spirits, dream beavers, interdimensional aliens but curses. puhlease.   whoa.  now do you believe. okay. i believe. i believe. i don't want to be cursed. being cursed sucks worse than being poisoned by karai.  actually, the getting poisoned part was pretty sweet. ow. according to lore, the only way to reverse the curse is to use the blades on the one who inflicted the curse, passing it back to them. then let's go fox hunting. so who is the alopex, comrade claw. yeah, and why are you so afraid of her, dude. i am not afraid of her. it is much more complex than that. listen well  we were children. a portal opened in our small village, and thinking it was a magic door, we entered.  the kraang mutated and experimented on us.  but after many months of hardships, we escaped through a portal back to earth.  but we were monsters now. we could not return home. and so we fled.  we found refuge in a circus sideshow.  but our skills were much too valuable. so we became toplevel assassins in the criminal underworld. we were notorious and feared. but then  she turned on me. and tried to kill me, but only ended up cutting off my tail. although she escaped, i was certain the wounds i inflicted upon her were far too grave for her to survive. i was wrong. she believes that i destroyed her life. she must have spent years searching for me. but now, it is i that will have vengeance.  alopex should be just up ahead.  hey. hey. are you all right in there. it's all good, brah. we're cool.  you're gonna get us all killed. you should have stayed home, casey. or should i call you "cursey". dude, i got to be the one to use the blades and cut alopex to pass the curse. so back off me, brah.  where are you, takeshi. you are close. i can feel it.  alopex. give us the blades. now. we don't want to hurt you. believe me, you won't.  yah. ah.  whoa. ah. ah.  what is going on. that's what we want to know. talk. i'm on a mission to destroy the one mutant who ruined my life. tiger claw. my brother.  oh, snap. brother. it's his fault we were mutated. and then he turned us to a life of crime. he made me do terrible things to people. alopex, our sensei once told us revenge just leads to more pain.  i want my brother to feel that pain. with these blades, i'll take more than his tail. we're not your enemy, alopex. please, help me lift the curse. the only way is to use the blades against me or destroy the steel. and until i have my revenge against my brother, that will not happen. deep.  this curse is the worst. my bad. come on, guys, every second we waste, casey could end up street pizza. mmm, mmm, mmm, one of my favorite kinds of pizza.  hee. here she comes, catmandu. get ready to pounce. takeshi. sister, before you attack, let us talk. no, takeshi. the twin swords work. a worthy curse for a monster such as you.  i know how you fight, alopex. i taught you how, remember. i know the truth about our parents. you were responsible. you took everyone away from me.    no. let me go. sister, all i ever tried to do was protect you from a world that would never accept us. you leave me no choice except to destroy you. ah. what. back off, tony. ah. get these chains off of me, turtle scum. thank you. we helped save you. now we need your help to save one of us. dope. ah. ah, now you will all be destructions. i'll handle the laser.  hey. give me that sword. get back here. oh.  you can't touch what you can't see. heehee. ah.  where am i. hoohoo.  ah. oh, no you don't.  whoa.  ah.   no.   ah.  i got it.  goongala. yes. i did it. your aura's looking good, jones. check me out, yo. casey jones is cursed no more. what, what.    ah.   you're the only family i have left. walk away from your wicked path, or next time, there is no mercy. you've been warned. ah. holy chalupa.  never forget, i could have taken your life.   hurry, t. c. we'll get you all fixed up. oh, man. that's nasty, yo. dudes, they're getting away. let 'em go. tiger claw will never forget this lesson. yeah, and he'll never be able to clap again. come on, team. let's go home. )
