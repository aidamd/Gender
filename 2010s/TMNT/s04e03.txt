"chris bradford and his 2ruff krew. " evil ninja has enlisted fake master, a trickster and master of disguise, to destroy us. we've got to find him before he finds us. we've run out of enemies to destroy, and none of them were fake master. what should we do, felicia. you've got man breath. oh, chris. you're so tough. and kind of stupid. it was me all along. fake master. felicia. for three years i've loved a rubber suit. no. i can't believe chris bradford had his own show back in the '80s. it's so lame it's awesome. i can't believe you used to worship that guy. what do you think, casey. casey. you'll be safe in here for now. stupid robot. it's mine. i found it. i'm supposed to open it. open. must open. oh. uh. ah. uh. ah. huh. ha. whoa. whoa. whoa, yeah. casey. what are you doing with that thing. huh. the professor said it was extremely dangerous. it's all right, as long as he hasn't opened it. uh oh. it is extremely open. hmm. eh. what. oh. huh. hello, hello, my friends. good to see ya. nice to meet ya. let me greet you. you can call me wyrm. here to make pals happy, help you out. ah. give you some love. i'm the most powerful wyrm in ten dimensions, and all i want to do is grant you three little wishes. well, technically two, since casey already made the first wish. like, this is totally boring. i wish something not boring would happen. it's why the spacezombies attacked. okay, so here are the rules. you got two more wishes, and you got to share them. we're living in hard economic times. ooh. ooh. ooh. you can never make a wish to get more wishes. against the rules. last rule: you can never ever wish to hurt a wyrm. so, otherwise, we can wish for anything at all. wow. that's right. so what's it gonna be. so, obviously we'll wish for an endless supply of comic books. or, oh, a space surfboard. yes. mikey. we got to think about this seriously. the first wish has got to be "save earth," right. stop the triceratons. does that count as two wishes. we could wish for universal peace throughout the galaxy. that would cover just about everything, right. how about something important, like casey jones becomes the ultimate super hero in the universe. casey. you already wasted a wish on those dumb astrozombies. oh, man, i wish you weren't such a big dummy. oops. donnie. whoa. i can see everything. every molecule. every electron. i've just counted the total amount of quadratic number fields with unique factorization. i am the dopest being in all of reality. what have i done. it's okay. we still have the third wish. we can fix everything. course you can. you just need to wish. so what's it gonna be. what's wrong. you scared of a teeny tiny wish. hold up. before we make any more wishes, we're gonna discuss this carefully. you can have all the power in the universe, but you want to discuss it. uh. we've hit something. the stars. they're gone. our spaceship. ahh. giant eyeball. we're somehow trapped both inside and outside the hypercube simultaneously in a fifthdimensional prison. i find that being inside a fifthdimensional prison really focuses the mind. now make a wish. one moment, please. our friend wyrm here is one of the three realitybending creators of chaos. they were put into fifthdimensional prisons millennia ago and scattered throughout the cosmos. ahh. fugitoid. granting all three wishes frees the wyrm of his prison forever. forget it, wyrm. you'll never get a third wish out of us. ahh. maybe this'll knock some sense into yez. uh. wyrm feels like causing a little chaos. know what i'm saying. wahh. ow. casey. you're super smart now. what do we do. arr, cap'n wyrm knows how to deal with a mutiny. why even bother fighting me, you dweebs. i'm too tough for ya. ah. ahh. ahh. get it off of me. ahh. ahh. wish i had an antiwyrm laser cannon. huh. huh. ha. oh, no. please. don't blast me. i know i was a little rude. a little wacky. a little off the wall. i'm so sorry. not buying it, wyrm. get a faceful of this. what. that's not fair. i made a wish. of course it's fair. remember. last rule. you can never ever make a wish to hurt a wyrm. and now wyrm is free to rule the cosmos. yeah, that's the fun part. come on. i'll show you. space is much too crowded. we're gonna do some space cleaning. ahh. why did i make that last wish. we got to do something, casey. there's nothing we can do, april. i've calculated 980,000 different scenarios, and they all end with wyrm ruling the cosmos. wyrm is the most powerful being in reality, so it makes perfect sense for me, the most intelligent being in the universe, to join him. ha. what are you doing, casey. the only smart thing, raphael. teaming up with wyrm. ah. time to play, fellas. uh. oh. uh. ow. oh. ahh. oh. ahh. ahh. uh. uh. huh. ah. ahh. uh. whoa. huh. see. my wishes work great. look what you could have had. i'll tell you what, smart guy. you and i will rule the universe together. swwweet. casey, you jerk. first i need a little proof of your loyalty. destroy the turtles. i agree, wyrmy. let's squash 'em. casey. how could you. but if i'm gonna take 'em out once and for all, i'm gonna need a wish. hmm. fine. you get a wish bonus. casey, i can't believe it. who are you. i wish we never found that stupid hypercube in the first place. what. you you can't wish that. oh, wow. not so dumb after all. casey, you're a genius. but but but if you never found the cube, then none of this ever happened. and you granted me a wish, and now you got to make it. no, no, no, no. your your wish is mmy command. no. so eerie. it's like a horror movie waiting to happen. i don't even have to be psychic to get a bad feeling about this place. i have a bad feeling too. like this is totally boring. i wish some no. don't wish anything. i don't know why, but just don't say a word. okay, red. what's the big deal. man. my sensors detect nothing left alive on that ship. you should all return immediately. i believe i have a lead on the triceraton mother ship. hey, did you guys hear a voice. ah, never mind. i just had a weird sense of dj vu. it's not fair. come back and make a wish. you hear me. let me out of here. )
