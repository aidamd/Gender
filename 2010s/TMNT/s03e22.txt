extreme, out the sewer like laser beams get rocked with the shellshocked pizza kings can't stop these radical dudes the secret of the ooze made the chosen few emerge from the shadows to make their move the good guys win, and the bad guys lose leonardo's the leader in blue does anything it takes to get his ninjas through donatello is the fellow who has a way with machines raphael's got the most attitude on the team michelangelo, he's one of a kind and you know just where to find him when it's party time master splinter taught 'em every single skill they need to be one lean, mean, green, incredible team teenage mutant ninja turtles teenage mutant ninja turtles teenage mutant ninja turtles heroes in a half shell, turtle power  your skills are much improved, april. now, see if you can defend yourself against leonardo. hmm. don't think i'm going easy on you this time, april. fine by me. bring it on. hajime.   two against one, huh. i can take you with my head in my shell.      huh.  okay, raph, mercy. white flag. i surrender. wow, donnie, i thought you had me there for a second, but that was just embarrassing. you hesitated, donatello. why. i know i should have countered, but ii guess i just drew a blank. you okay, donnie. i thought a little training would clear my head. i can't figure out this brain worm solution for karai. anything i can do. yeah, maybe. i could use a fresh sample of your dna.  but how did mikey. it jumped off the shelf on its own. what the whoa. okay, i totally didn't do this. at least i don't think i did this. mikey. aah. uh uh, i can help you clean it up. i won't break anything, promise. the stuff that is the stuff must be picked up, or that which is known as donatello's head will explode.  real funny. just don't break anything else, raph. or spill anything or drop anything or you just called me raph, dude. i'm mikey. i did. i whatever. just just keep cleaning, mikey. you okay, d.  i'm fine. why.  because you're holding the broom upside down. huh. yeah. ii meant to do that. it's just i have a bad headache.  let me get you some ice. just sit right back.   thanks, ice cream kitty.  is everything all right, april. i'm not sure, sensei. i sense something's wrong with donnie, but i can't figure it out. maybe he's just distracted. mm. donatello often puts too much burden on himself. sometimes the best solution only arrives when you take a step back from the problem. thanks, master splinter.  please close the freezer. ice cream kitty is beginning to melt.    aah.  the creep.  aah.  guys. aah.   you. the creep is back. aah. how is that freak back. all right, creep, you want some of our mutagen. then how about  what's it doing. i don't know, but it's freaking me out, dudes.   aah. whoa.  is everyone okay.  hai, sensei. that creep must be what trashed the lab. how'd it get out. mikey. mikey. it wasn't my fault. are you guys all right. i think so. but the creep's gone.  yeah, and i think it took something from the toy shelf. that snakeweed claw is gone. what would it want that for. i got a bad feeling i know why. yeah.  wait. what were we talking about again. hmm. mm.  okay, donnie, focus. we need to find the creep. the creep is back. oh, man, my experiment. are you all right. you're acting more spaced out than mikey. hey. isn't that the brain worm serum you were working on. it was until mikey ruined it and spilled some on me. we don't have time for this. we got to find that thing. the trail is starting to run cold. what do you got, donnie. is that a video game. what the heck are you doing, man. just use your ooze scanner. oh, right. i don't i'm not getting a signal. why won't this thing work. wait. donnie said mikey spilled that brain stuff on him, right. it affected the creep somehow. did you see that weird look it gave us. yeah, he didn't look like his usual mindless sack of grass self. but if it made the creep smarter, why is donnie getting i got it.   donnie, have you lost your mind. what do you mean. guys, the creep's going north on bleecker, just a block away. raph, mikey, you're with me. april, keep an eye on donnie.  we got to get this thing moving. can you remember what you did. uh, no idea. how hard could it be.  huh. that wasn't donnie.  fantastic. remember, team, don't let the creep touch you. no kidding.   the snakeweed claw. hey, guys. what up  shh.  this looks bad. whoa. the creep made a son of snakeweed. that's what i was gonna name it.  where do these guys aah. come from.  they're working together. just like in swamp creatures      aah.   all right. give me your best shot.   everyone, back to the shellraiser.  ii don't understand. i can't think of anything.  if the creep is after mutagen, maybe we can bait it into a trap. that's actually a good idea, mikey. yeah, but we got to use ourselves as bait.   leo, thank goodness. donnie's gone. we got him. we're on our way. you got the shellraiser working. mikey, what's going on. shellax. just stay put here, bro. i'll be right back. come on, creepy creep.    squirrel. the alley. draw them into the alley. come on, salad face. this way. come on. come get some.  over here, swamp creatures. april, now.  i like french fries. donnie.  yeah. whoohoo. you got stirfried, sons. guess i better get that learner's permit soon. no worries, april. the shellraiser's seen worse. it's not the shellraiser i'm worried about. wow, look at that fire. hey, you guys want to toast some marshmallows. oh, man. let's get donnie back home, asap.    donnie. he's getting worse every minute.  when did we get a tire swing. donnie.  yeah, and the only one of us that can figure out what's wrong with donnie is donnie.    if we knew what was in that brain worm solution, maybe we could figure out how to reverse it.  hmm. it's my fault donnie got splashed with that brain juice. i'm not kidding. got to make it right. donnie. okay, what did he do.   aah.  what do you think, master splinter. it is possible whatever caused it could be the solution to curing it. perhaps meditation could help him. aah. the snow cats are stealing the power of my brain. we're doomed. i'm melting. melting. a lot of meditation.  even mikey's a genius compared to him. wait. where is mikey. and one pepperoni for flavor. check it out, guys. brain juice for donnie. mmm, delicious. are you crazy. you have no idea what that could do to him. i know you guys think donnie's the only one that knows sciencey stuff, but i pay attention. remember that freaky mutant wasp. this is a whole other thing, mikey. mmm, pizza shake. no, wait. donnie. whoohoo.  donnie. say something.   mikey.    earthquake. what's going on.   guys, i think we made it worse.   i want to see. i want to see.  whoa. the creep and snakeweed have combined into creepweed.  this is bad. we need donnie for something like this. unfortunately someone made him dumber than himself.  it's like creepweed is making the city its own giant plant food buffet. just like in swamp creatures are we gardeners or ninjas. how are we gonna stop that thing. the party wagon is still fully loaded. let's do this.  i'll stay here with donnie. maybe i can get through to him somehow. good luck. sensei, do you think your healing mantra can work on donnie. highly doubtful.  look at the people. creepweed put them all to sleep. quick. breathing units. you got a plan yet. first we got to free those people before creepweed turns them into plant food. mikey, you said you wanted to fix this. you ready. oh, yeah. you know it.  booyakasha.  meet the grass kicker.   it's still growing back. torch that creep.    i think we made it mad.     guys.  oh, no.   oh, no. leo.  aah. get away from my brothers.  mikey. are you okay. i'm good, bro. maybe not so good.     oh, no.    all right, creepweed. yeah, that's right. i named you creepweed. you like that. no, huh. well, too bad.  you want me. come and get me.      aah.     get away from him, you extinct digitaria sanguinalis. donnie. you know what this is. retromutagen based weed killer.  come get some.    donnie. you're back.  your antidote actually worked. it did. i mean, of course it did. come on. let's get the guys out of here before all the people wake up.  well, this should keep what's left of creepweed secure. it's good to have you back, donnie. it's good to be back. and thanks for your help, april. the shellraiser thing was kind of embarrassing, like mikeylevel embarrassing. aw, yeah. hey. i can't believe mikey actually came up with the right antidote. i guess he really does have a photographic memory. even the nitrates in the pepperoni acted as the perfect reversing agent. i owe you bigtime, mikey. you know, i got to admit, sometimes i can be hard on you and act like you're not as smart as me. no worries, brah. but now i finally understand how you feel all the time. thanks, donnie. wait a sec. donnie. )
