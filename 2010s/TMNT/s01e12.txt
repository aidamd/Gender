wants to try my latest creation. we all love pizza. we all love milkshakes. so i combined them. okay, that could not be less appetizing. i call it a pshake.  i stand corrected. you guys just have no sense of adventure. blech. ugh. ugh. where did i go wrong. ahh. ugh.  in all my travels, i've never seen anything as cute as these trumpets.  but i'll be darned if they're not the most annoying species in the cosmos.  captain, we've got to find a humane way to get rid of them. if there's one thing i'm known for, it's my humanity. open the airlock.  you have to be the only person in the world who likes this show. no way. there are millions of spaceniks out there. i'm joan grody, with a sewer shocker. city workers attacked by mutants. all: huh. it was like part man, part reptile, and all monster. it came out of nowhere and attacked me. wasn't me. take a look at this terrifying footage. so some people think the sewers are dark and scary, but actually, it's a lot of    somebody help me. are malicious mutants menacing manhattan. find out next on grody  to the max. i got a bad feeling about this. the last thing we want is some mutant causing trouble in the sewers. or some news crew down here looking for him. we've got to track this guy down and stop him ourselves. wait, let's rewind this. think i saw a tunnel number. there, tunnel 281. let's go. whoa, check this out. what the heck made these footprints.    wha. whoa.   oh. oh, whoa. i never thought i'd feel sorry for the kraang.      tell kraang in what place can be found the power cell that kraang wishes to find the place of.  never.   come on, we gotta help him. i think "gotta" is a strong word. mikey, we don't know anything about that guy. he could be way more dangerous than the kraang. that gator dude needs our help. i can't wait around for you cowards. do you know what you're getting into. booyakashaaa.   well, i guess that settles it. let's go whack some pinatas.    waaah.  hyah.  hmm. huh. hyah. whoa.  so what do we do now. we get out of here before more kraangdroids show up. we can't just leave him here. what if the kraang find him. well, what do you want to do. take him back to the lair.  oh, no. oh, no. did did you see what he did to those kraangdroids. we are not bringing that monster home with us. he's not a monster. he's a giant, kraangcrushing mutant alligator monster. i said monster, didn't i. yep. sure did. well, you know what i meant. i thought you meant monster. me too. yep. fine. i'll bring him back myself.  um, donnie, you don't happen to have a forklift, do you. no. okay.   all:  i can't believe we let him talk us into this. aww, look at him. he's so peaceful.  that's because he's out cold.  whoa, what are those for. we can't keep him here unless he's chained to something really big. that is so wrong. he's not going to hurt us. we're the ones who saved him. see. he's perfectly calm. i bet the first thing he's gonna do is thank  uhoh.  or maybe the second thing.  wahoo. get him off me. get him off me. i'll help you, donnie. not like that. not like that. all:  ugh.  whoa. ugh. help me.  yah.  what is all this commotion. sensei, mikey made us bring a mutant back to the lair, and it attacked us. it needs our help. it's a dangerous monster. raphael. there is no monster more dangerous than a lack of compassion.  my mistake. we're doing to him what everyone else does to us judging him by his looks. and the fact that he had me  by the face, mikey. but he was fighting the kraang, master splinter. it's like you always say: the enemy of my enemy is my bro. that is not exactly what i said. but what's this about the kraang. they were trying to force him to tell them where they could find some power cell. and he refused to tell. yeah. they were all like, "zap, zap, zap," and he was all like, "rawr, never." hmm. i see. you made a wise decision, michelangelo. others: huh. yes, i never thought i'd hear myself say that either. hmm. his scars run deep, but they protect a genuine heart. when he awakens, michelangelo, you must find a way to befriend him. no problemo. we need to learn what he knows about the kraang. in the meantime, you three try to find this power cell before the kraang can. but we're still chaining him up, right. of course. i am compassionate, not insane.  i don't suppose this is a power cell. huh.  oh. quit goofing around, raph. hold on a second.  if an alligator wanted to hide something, where would he put it. i'm thinking underwater. alligators love to drag their prey to the bottom of swam agh. thanks. don't mention it. hey, this pool is deeper than it looks. it keeps going. well, sounds like we should agh. way ahead of you. where am i.    well, look who's awake. you. set me free.  oh, yeah, sorry about the chains. the guys said i had to keep you locked up or you might attack me. who are you. what am i doing here. i'm michelangelo. my brothers and i saved you from the kraang.   kraang. whoa, whoa.  it's okay. you're safe. we brought you here so you could get better. and nothing will heal you faster than my world famous pizza noodle soup.    this is the best thing i have ever tasted. really. all right. somebody finally likes my cooking.  oh. gah. sometimes it's good to be a turtle.   both:  and sometimes it's good to be a short turtle.  the place is boobytrapped. run. all:  so, what's your name, anyway. i do not have one. you don't have a name. ha. well, today's your lucky day, 'cause i'm a genius at naming stuff. let's see. mmhmm. mm mm. mmmm. mm your head is kind of leathery. how about headleather. heather. no, wait. leatherhead. even better. leatherhead. leatherhead it is. thank you. no problemo. it's what i do. so i've been wanting to ask you, why did you go all crazyeyes on my brother donnie. your brother. yeah. instead of shaking his hand, you shook his face and most of his body.   there are times when i lose control. when i awaken, i am horrified by what i have done. a monster like me deserves to be chained. or maybe you just think you're a monster because everyone treats you that way. hmm. you are wise beyond your years. yeah, i get that a lot. all:   this thing's putting out some power. whoa.  why am i the one that always has to touch the weird kraang stuff. any idea what they would use it for. with the right components, it could power almost anything flashlight, blaster cannon, city on the moon. why would the gator even want this thing. let's bring it back home and ask him. great, but who's gonna carry it through the water. aw, man. i'm sure it'll be fine. but you go first, okay.   zzzt. oh.  not funny. whoa. hey, guys. leatherhead is totally off the chain. you mean you set him free. what. no. "off the chain" means he's cool.  and that's why i set him free.    you let that maniac loose. maybe you forgot that he grabbed me by the face. so i'll remind you. he grabbed me by the face. relax. you've been hurt worse since. mikey, you shouldn't have unchained him. what if he goes berserk. he's not going to go berserk. he's totally mellow. okay. so, leatherhead  about the kraang.   kraang.  dude, chill. chill.  what were you thinking. you said he was mellow. i didn't know you were going to ask him about the youknowwho. okay, what should i do. i don't know, maybe start with an icebreaker, like, "how was your day." fine.  um leatherhead. how was your day. it started out awful. yeah, you were attacked by the kraang.  kraang. my bad. yahh. whoa, buddy. cleansing breaths. cleansing breaths. cleansing breaths. you know you're in a safe place now, right.  yes. my brothers just want to ask you a few questions. do you think you can handle that.  yes. okay. now, what is it that you guys wanted to ask. okay. wwwe just want to know what this is.  thief. oh, come on.  this is not my day. all:       whoa, whoa. aah.  leatherhead, relax. it's okay.  no. put that down.  whoa. whoa.  stop. get away from my sons.   leave this place. out.   boys, are you all right. yeah. yeah, we're okay. where is michelangelo. you don't think he went after leatherhead, do you.  no. only an idiot would oh, boy. leatherhead. leatherhead.  huh.     dude. leatherhead, what's the big idea, man. you should not be here. i trusted you. then you freak out and attack my entire family. i thought we were friends. i warned you that there is a dangerous force inside me that i cannot control. and that is why i must be alone. leatherhead get away from mikey, or we'll turn you into the world's ugliest suitcase. please. i mean him no harm. it was the kraang that made me this way. i was raised by a kind human boy, until his parents discovered me and dumped me in the sewer. the kraang found me and took me to their dimension. they mutated me and subjected me to horrible experiments. but they could not break my spirit.   six months ago, i escaped through the portal that they used to travel to earth, and i stole this. what did they use it for. it powers the portal. without it, no kraang can enter  or leave this dimension. i swore to keep it from them and spare this world from their evil, even at the cost of my own life.    give to kraang the power cell that kraang has come to demand that you give to kraang. it's the kraang. quick, barricade the doors. all:     both:    oh, nno, no. ow.   ugh. kraang. aah. ugh.   we're surrounded. we'll never hold them off. we gotta get out of here. donnie, can you get this subway car running. this track is dead. there's no electricity. what about the power cell. can you use that. i might be able to hook it up to the motor, but i'll need time. i will buy you time. my friend, you have trusted me. now i am trusting you. i will deal with the kraang.    donnie, we're running out of time. i'm working as fast as i can.  donnie will you hurry up. i got it.  all:    where the heck are we.  according to my calculations  sewage plant. wow. it's as beautiful as they say.   we must notify kraang, that the ones called the turtles have taken kraang's power cell from kraang.   you won't be telling anyone anything.  )
