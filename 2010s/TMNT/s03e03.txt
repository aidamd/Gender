"mom". take it easy, ma'am. hold on. aah. mutants. oh, uh, don't worry, mrs. o'neil. these are good mutants. except for donnie. he's kind of a jerk. yeah hey. where am i. and how do you know my aapril. but but how. just a few days ago, you were only six years old. mom. snap. here you go, mom. just relax. thank you, april. i'm still a little shaky. i know this is hard to believe, but the kraang ship has been here for years. it was your greatgrandfather who discovered it. he made the mistake of awakening the kraang. they paid him back by experimenting on him and his entire bloodline. they knew we were the key to unlocking their precious mutagen. we were their guinea pigs. aww. guinea pigs are so cute. i told you not to be stupid, you moron. ow. after you were born, it was clear you were very special. we knew it was only a matter of time before the kraang came for you. we escaped. kirby fled with you to the city. i was recaptured and put into stasis. all these years, i never knew what happened to you. i never knew what to think. dad would never tell me. now you know, and now we never have to be apart again. where is kirby, anyway. kirby. oh, he got turned into a wicked kraangheaded mutant. you had to pull a mikey, didn't you. ha ha. you pulled a mikey. he's just kidding, mrs. o'neill. kirby's, uh, on a safari in puerto rico. he won't be back for a while. i'm just so glad to have my april back. is it me or does april's mom seem a little bit off. ha. like you're one to talk. i'm serious, dude. i got those ninja vibes, yo. i don't trust her. remember how we used to sit out here in the summertime and look up at the stars. like it was yesterday. but so much has happened. so much time has passed. and that's exactly what it is. the past. we're together again. oh, mom. something's not right here. we can start over. we can be a family again. if only dad were here. booyakasha. mikey. what are you doing. get away from april. i'm warning you. ah. what the heck is wrong with you. have you lost your mind. don't bother answering that. april, wait. i can explain. mom. april, hold on. michelangelo you attacked april's mother. mikey, have you completely cracked your shell. i don't trust her. she's all kinds of wrong. you guys got to believe me. oh, just like the time tiny elves stole your nunchucks and replaced 'em with mozzarella sticks. yes. or the time you and ice cream kitty entered a break dancing contest. exactly. stop it, mikey. do you have any idea how much this means to april. if you ruin this for her fine. if you don't believe me, i'll prove it. mom are you okay. i was just thinking about when we'd picnic in the woods by the stream. those are some of my favorite memories. we should go somewhere, just the two of us. just drive off, leave these creatures behind. i don't trust them. ii can't do that. why not. they're like family. they've always been there for me. i'm your mother, your family, not them. they're just a bunch of freaks. no one gets me. no one but you. aww. see. you're just so cute, i could eat you up. om nom nom nom nom. what do you think, kitty. go after her. my thoughts exactly. sweet mother of mutagen. you foolish whelp. don't try flattering me. you shouldn't have done that, michelangelo. now you've made mother very angry. i knew there was something wrong with you. you're with the kraang. yes. i will capture april o'neil and take her to my masters. well, mom, things are about to get a lot worse. hyah. what the waah. ha. ah. aah. oh. ugh. mom's a lot tougher than i thought. aah. what are you, really. help. hmm. what up, d. whoa. you scared me, mikey. i'm just looking over data from the cryotube's computers. some of these readouts don't make sense. donnie, have you seen mom. no. what's up. we sort of had a little argument earlier, and now she's gone probably because mikey freaked her out. don't worry, april. i'm sure she's around. i'll be up in one minute to help look for her. no, thanks, mikey. i don't need your help. now let's see exactly what the kraang did to april's mom. no, it it can't be. she's she's not i got to tell the others. hello, donatello. aah. whwhat happened to mikey. i got to warn the others. whoa. let me go. mrs. o'neil. uh, mom. hey, donnie, uh, where's mom. no one's here but me. i could've sworn i saw her come in here. mm, sorry, leo. haven't seen her. okay, then. i guess i was mistaken. gotta move. what the heck. leo. bro, you okay. i think so. what happened. mikey was right. april's mom really is a creature. what. where is it. here. whoa. now you see me so that's it. she's leaving tonight. and if i don't go with her, she's going anyway. she's too scared of the turtles. that's rough, red, but i understand if you want to go with her. she's your mom. it's just april. casey. raph, what is it. it's your mother. she's not mikey was right. she really is some kind of creature, and she's done something to the others. no. no, you're wrong. aw, come on, raph. not you too. she's not what you think she is. april. april, i told you to pack your bags. stay back. what did you do to my brothers. april, now. i said stay back, momthing. stop it, raph. stop it right now. ow. that's it. mom. we're leaving now. what's going on. i'm your mother. what the heck. let her go. ha. oh, my gosh. i think i'm gonna puke. move. hurry. hurry. casey, come on. there's no way to stop this thing. she was frozen when we found her. maybe we can freeze it again. no, we fry it. time for casey jones to play some offense. goongala. okay, that didn't work. we just got to hack it to pieces. get your slimy suckers off of me. casey, raph, no. no. this is not happening. it's not. it's not. april, we can be together. no more pain. no more sorrow. join us. become one. one of us. one of us. you are not my mother. no. no. we will be a family again. it's all we ever wanted. are you guys okay. let me put it to you this way. i'm pretty sure i swallowed about 15 pounds of slime. i feel like if puke could puke, it would be us. thanks, april. so when i downloaded the data from the kraang ship, i discovered the creature wasn't really april's mom. it just had her memories. so what was it. some sort of early infiltration experiment that utilized a combination of mrs. o'neil's dna and kraang dna, but it was too dangerous. so the kraang put it in a deep freeze. it all makes sense. guys, do we have to talk about this right now. april, you okay. yeah, it just feels like i've lost my family all over again, even if it really wasn't my mom. maybe she really is gone forever, but maybe maybe she's still out there somewhere. you can't give up hope. trust me on that. and you haven't lost your family 'cause we are your family. and i want to say to my bros, i was right. in your face. in your face. whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. hold up. didn't you mention something about mutagen being spilled in the woods. uh yeah. well, do you remember where it was. mm nope. oh, no. you know what this means, right. )
