the weirdest dream. you can't be dreaming. i'm here. 'cause i'm dreaming you. maybe i'm dreaming you. but you're not dreaming me. aw, man. where'd all the candy go. hang on. guys i think we're all in the same dream. that's impossible. nothing's impossible for the dream beavers. i'm sorry, did you just say dream beavers. ollyollyoxenfree. you think you are alone in your dreams. but no. for years, we have lurked in this dream dimension, stealing the life force of humans. draining them dry and but dudes. we're not human. that is precisely what makes your life force so delicious. seriously. human life force, every meal, for thousands of years. then one day, turtles. i like chocolate chip cookies. shut up, dave. we're gonna drain you dry and spit out the shells. aah. aah. would you knock it off. i'm just trying to help my aah. friends. what. i can't hear you over the chainsaw. give me a minute, here. ow. what is wrong with you. ah, i'm sorry. i'm a little highstrung. i haven't slept in 40 years. because of the dream beavers. what are dream beavers. they're beings of pure evil from another dimension. you see, it all began 40 years ago. nobody asked, dude. i was a physicist trying to prove my theory that our dreams take place in a dimension of their own when a defective portal projector short circuited and i lost consciousness. the dream beavers had been about to break through into our reality, but instead, they materialized in the dream dimension in my dream. when i awoke, they remained trapped in the world of dreams, unable to return as long as this device remains operating. device. it's a book, bernie. obturaculum somniorum means "dream plug. " for 40 years, i have protected the plug to ensure that the dream beavers remain trapped. for 40 years, i have remained awake so that they cannot drain my life force. but they are always near. they attack anyone close to me and drain the life from them when they sleep. that's why i came out here, far away from everyone. not far enough. they're draining my friends right now. and you're gonna do something about it. destroy them. now you see me. now you don't. uhh. this isn't working. aah. hold still, dave. i gotta chuck ya. ooh. uh aah. wah. hee hee hee hee. ah hee hee hee hee hee. aah. aah. you said that wouldn't work. i don't know what else to do. i can barely find their pulses anymore. if we can't wake them up, they won't make it. ah. oh, my gosh. is that tv set an astroview. really. not, "oh my gosh, giant turtles." you see them too. bernie. the dream beavers are sucking out their life force. how can we wake them up. you can't. the obturaculum keeps the beavers trapped in the dream realm, and as long as they're there their dream powers are unbeatable. that's why i don't sleep. got any coffee, by the way. he's not breathing. donnie's not breathing. so this is what keeps them in the dream realm. yeah. wait, what are you no. what's this. the barrier is broken. we are free. free. you're okay. muah. the obturaculum is broken. the beavers are free. free to destroy our world. all is lost. all is aah. wait a second aw, dang. hi, dave. hi, mikey. shut up, dave. this is it. this is what i've been protecting the earth from for 40 years. plush toys. if i were you guys, i'd be leaving. my thoughts exactly. come, beavers. let us leave this world for one that is all right, we're going. big bully. april, casey, giant talking turtles, i've been awake for 40 years for no good reason. so if you'll excuse me well, who wants to help me carry him back home. i know that was terrifying and we nearly bought it and everything, but my leg really feels a lot better. see. i told you some rest would help. wait a second. did did april kiss me a while back. dream on, donnie. dream on. )
