captain's log, star date no idea. the evil triceratons, a race of aliens from across the galaxy, invaded earth. they wanted to wipe out their ancient enemy, the kraang, so they unleashed a black hole weapon that destroyed both the kraang and their secret hiding place, earth. we lost our friends, our allies, even master splinter. we were only saved at the last second by a mysterious robot called the fugitoid.     all right, fugitoid, or whatever your name is, what just happened. this has got to be some kind of sick joke, right. right. ah. calm down, raphael. first things first. i have a job to do. now, please, i've got a ship to fly while you all stand about gawking. that's not good enough. where are you taking us. all questions will be answered in time.  hold on to something.  oh, oh, too late for that. apologies. not cool bro. teenage mutant ninja the evil triceratons have invaded earth. they brought with them the invincible black hole generator that swallowed the entire planet. my brothers and i escaped, saved by a mysterious robot called the "fugitoid.
