2x06 target: april o'neil so, daughter, not only do you disobey my orders in my absence your petty scheme failed miserably. it was those stupid footbots. they couldn't keep up with the turtles. but one good thing the kraang have been upgrading them, so hear me, karai. you will have no more dealings with the kraang until i return. understood, father. wait for my command, and do not defy me again. the consequences would be unfortunate. not bad. how soon until it's online. by kraang's calculations, nine earth hour units before nine hours. i want to test it on someone now. and i've got the perfect target, too april o'neil. is there a problem with that. kraang sees no foreseeable problem, one called karai. good. now, let's speed up the process. you don't want to keep the shredder waiting, now, do you. teenage mutant ninja turtles here we go, it's the lean green ninja team on the scene, cool teens doing ninja things so extreme, out the sewer like laser beams get rocked with the
