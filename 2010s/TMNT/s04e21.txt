deep, yo. i've definitely lost my mental connection with splinter. but that doesn't mean he's gone. we can't give up hope. that's right. splinter is still alive. he he has to be. right, guys. right. we're going back. we'll search every inch of that hole if we have to. we'll find master splinter. and we'll stop anything that gets in our way.   master shredder. you survived. is splinter gone. perhaps. but he is a resilient old rat.  help me. huh. must get more mutagen. your hand. tread carefully, master. we warned you the mutagen was unstable. if we give you more of the serum do not lecture me, old friend. send zeck and steranko to search every inch of the chasm. we must be sure splinter is gone.  wait, dudes. how come the b team has to do this mission. because we're gonna guard you from the super shredder. unless you'd like to switch jobs. spelunking, it is. so if shredder is still alive, and his goons show up we'll be ready. for sensei. all: for sensei.     my leg.       wake up, splinter. you must not slip back into sleep. rats must be alert at all times. i can help you, old friend. who are you. show yourself. you sent me here. and now, you join me in the darkness. two similar, misbegotten creatures. hamato yoshi, splinter. and i, your lord. your master. your rat king.   you. but i sent you plunging into darkness. how could you have survived. you survived, did you not. then why are you still here. why did you not escape. there is no escape. we are both trapped like rats. but here, in the darkness, you belong to me. never.  you only weaken yourself trying to fight me. you can never leave this place. look at you. how can you climb with such a broken and feverish body.      i'll stay here on lookout. the rest of you, hurry up. master splinter needs you. we'll stay with you, leo. you need us. if shredder survived, you can't take him alone. well, thanks for your vote of confidence. no way, dog, i'm not climbing down there, either. come on, we're doin' rock, paper, scissors. one, two, three. ha. paper beats rock, son.  but paper no good against rock. rock destroy paper. dummy, paper wraps around a rock like this. do i got to keep explaining it to you. so where did splinter jump. this way. what you do that for. the turtles are looking for splinter. so we wait here, let them do all the work for us, and haul up splinter's body. tight. very tight.  sweet. grapple harness time. we have to take it slow, mikey. the walls are crumbling, so be careful. you got me. be careful. i always am, d. booyakasha. whoohoo. mikey. whoa, dude. this cave goes on for, like, ever. take it slow, mikey. master splinter's down there. somewhere.  my head. must have fever. you are weak. you need water. and food. your body craves sustenance. where could it be.  no. i will not. so noble. you think that makes you more than a beast. spend enough time with me here, and you will see you are nothing but an animal. an animal who must do whatever he can to survive. i hope they're okay. it's awfully quiet down there. and awfully boring. i wish something crazy would happen.  ow. whoa. raph, someone's out there.  aah.  you jerks, you hit me in my piggy snout. bebop and rocksteady.  now, you will bring us furry rat man ninja or we will break you like dancer. no, no, breakdancing ain't got nothing to do with aw, forget it. take 'em down, g.  look out. heehee.  master splinter. hello. quiet, mikey. if super shredder survived that fall sorry, d, but how else are we gonna find him. there are tons of caves down here. he could be anywhere.   they're coming. they'll be here any minute. there's no way we'll be able to keep them from the undercity. we bait them to the surface. no, we take them down on the surface. we finish them both.  here they come. master shredder.

were a man. and then you became a beast. now, you are nothing. a void. a shadow. embrace the darkness, hamato yoshi. to embrace it is to become a monster such as you. leave me. if you will not join me, then you will be devoured.       no.  did we lose 'em. um, i don't think so.  look out.   no.   hah.   you're coming with me, girl.      this is gonna hurt.     goodbye, turtle.      splinter, it would be easier to accept my dominion.   become one with me, hamato yoshi. it will only cost you your soul.     yes. this is what you are. a monster. a freak. an animal.    shredder. let him go,
