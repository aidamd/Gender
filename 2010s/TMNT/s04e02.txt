      you sluggish fools. stay alert. the salamandrians slipped past you like slitherfish. captain mozar, sir. scanners are picking up an incoming ship.  i know that vessel. it's the fugitoid ship. squadron three, blast them out of the sky.    those ships. they're triceraton. no kidding. and there's, like, a gajillion of them. professor, what do we do. we take evasive action. what are you waiting for, gunner zork. blast the fugitoid to pieces.  i think we're almost out of this.   or not. i recommend we take plunging into the lethal, crushing gravity of that gas giant philosophically. what is that supposed to mean. it means we're all gonna die. teenage mutant ninja the evil triceratons have invaded earth. they brought with them the invincible black hole generator that swallowed the entire planet. my brothers and i escaped, saved by a mysterious robot called the fugitoid. now we're trying to stop the triceratons any way we can. teenage mutant ninja turtles teenage mutant ninja turtles teenage mutant ninja turtles heroes in a half shell, turtle power leonardo's the leader in blue does anything it takes to get his ninjas through donatello is the fellow who has a way with machines raphael's got the most attitude on the team michelangelo, he's one of a kind and you know just where to find him when it's party time master splinter taught 'em every single skill they need to be one lean, mean, green, incredible team teenage mutant ninja turtles teenage mutant ninja turtles teenage mutant ninja turtles heroes in a half shell, turtle power   april, look out. thanks, d. whoa. whoa.  i hate space. i hate it. i really do.    collision course red.  we're going down. brace yourself, lieutenant.     my head. where are we. whoa. temperatures on this moon are negative180 degrees celsius.  so cold, even in this suit. aren't the turtles gonna freeze. no, their suits permeate a warm, invisible force field, like a second skin. cozy, right. i'm pretty sure my shell froze to my butt.  what's it looking like, fugitoid. if i had to categorize our situation, it would fall somewhere between "probably doomed" and "unequivocally doomed. " wait. so no power. we won't be able to charge our suits. and worse, we've only got a couple hours of oxygen and heat left. oh, man. i was supposed to go out in a blaze of glory, with, like, giant transforming robots frying me with lasers. not like this.   wow. you're a strange, little snow creature, aren't you. there's life on this planet, guys. nonsense. this moon is made of methane ice. no life can survive here. beep. now, let's see  yes. irrilium metal. lots of it. about ten klicks away. ooh, looks like it's refined too. excellent work, donatello. we could use that metal to patch up the ship. there they are, the ones who rammed our vessel. yes, and they're heading towards the irrilium.  we must capture it before they do. let us destroy the interlopers and take the irrilium for ourselves. they robbed us of glorious battle. still, when i gaze upon them, i see their courage. others would have despaired, but they go onward as comrades. i can respect them. no. you know that is not the salamandrian way, commander. they must be destroyed.    there: the irrilium is somewhere up on that ice peak. oh, yeah. check me out. michelangelo on ice. you're using up oxygen too fast, mikey. what's more important, bro. breathing or my art. guys. something's not right. weird vibe alert. my sensors suggest we're about to be visited by  whoa. what the heck. newtralizers. you downed our ship, dishonored us. now you will fight us. wait. wait, wait, wait. we are all honorable beings here. we did not intend to damage your ship. please, we can help one another in this desperate plight. it is true we are all trapped. cooperation is survival here. but you are outworlders.  everyone is an outworlder on a world not their own. listen, sister. we don't want to fight ya. you're clearly outnumbered. numbers mean nothing. i do not fear you or your friends. look, man. it's all good. we're all cool here. i'm offering my hand. put her there, bro. what. i consider conciliation, and you offer the hand of combat. combat. no. you don't understand. ah, yes. i should have warned you. to salamandrians, the hand extended gesture means attack.  all of you should stop fighting and rationally consider the damage to your faceplates. one crack, and death is imminent.  those who dishonor us shall be destroyed. you got some imagination, sweetheart. please, everyone booyaka. yo, lizard lips.    hold still, you stupid well, i suppose i'll have to intervene. oh, dear. you okay, april.  that's it. you're going down.   aah. raph.  never been hit like that before  it was kinda nice. discussion follows dishonor.  i am a pacifist. but even pacifists have to stand their ground once in awhile.  rokka rokka.     we must dig the creatures out and resume the battle. it is as dishonorable death. no. let them freeze. we must hurry to the irrilium.   no need to worry. only a minor inconvenience.  we keep getting our shells handed to us. we got to keep going. not much heat left. come on.  i've been thinking. i bet those salamandrians are after the irrilium too. another reason to hurry, people. hey, casey. do you think a turtle can, like, date a newt. dude. what.  i mean, you know, maybe, um, these salamandrians aren't so bad. like, the lizard girl is cool. you really are running low on oxygen, raph. what are you gonna do, ask that giant newt out on a date. well, i mean i don't know. wow, you really got a crush on that salamander hottie. she's, like, bigger, stronger, and probably a better fighter than you. exactly. what a woman. ooh. the irrilium's not far ahead. and i was right. the metal's completely refined. so they survived. the robot stated our collision was an accident. perhaps we need not be enemies. commander g'throkka, do not be foolish. they are clearly working with the triceratons. we do not know that.  they fought you four against one. they are cowardly, dishonorable fools. rokka, rokka. come. we will reach the irrilium far faster than they will. so what happens if those aliens make it to the irrilium first. i've got the answer. we take them down, goongalastyle. whoa, hold up. let's cut the salamanders a break. they think we're the bad guys, right. what if we could convince them to work with us, to find that metal stuff together. worst idea you've had, and that's saying something. forget it, raph. let's just get that irelium.  got to try this.  might be our only chance. guys, hold up. where's raph. oh, no i bet he went off to talk to his girlfriend. i've got a bad feeling about this. yeah. we're in trouble.  serious trouble. donnie. no. lieutenant y'gythgba, we are getting close to the irrilium. rokka rokka. and by now, those lowgrade life forms are surely frozen. tada. impressed, right. no, but i respect your tenacity. wait. before you blast me, hold up. look, we could we could all work together as a team, a unit. your bravery speaks of a heroic heart, stranger. but you are in our way.  that's not good teamwor  interesting that you chose to shoot the ice, and not the stranger. there is no significance to my look.  ice dragons.  aah.             g'throkka. commander.        stranger. oh, space apples. stranger. don't shoot. don't shoot.   huh.  you truly are a noble creature. my name's, uh, raphael. i am called y'gythgba. you are called i  i got an idea. back on earth, there's this painting of, like, the most beautiful woman in art and stuff. um, so how about if i call you mona lisa. as you please, raphael. someday our noses will meet in the flesh. my nose will be ready. so, mona lisa, what are we gonna do about your pal. perhaps if i use a low output yes, i believe he'll be fine in no time at all. how's it going, fugitoid. donatello is almost fully thawed out, although i think his face seems to have melted as well.   oh, no. oh, man. i think we're in trouble.     whoa, raph's with the bad guys.  we're friends now, mikey. i am commander g'throkka. that name's cool and all, but i got something better. how about laser lizard. no, no, no. g. i. newt. nah, i got it. sal commander.   is that all of them. i won't offer my hand, but i will offer my friendship.   okay, that was weird. now let's go get that irebilililium. okay, closer, closer. there, that satellite. it's made of irrilium. that's no satellite. it's a triceraton space mine.  if we could deactivate it, we could use the irrilium to fix our ships, right. hm, let me see yes. the irrilium is perfect. it even contains a dark matter regulator. we got to hurry. i'm getting short on power and oh, no. there are too many to fight. i got a plan. come on.   fugitoid. hustle.      booyakasha.  the ship's up ahead. hurry. ah. aah.    oh, yeah. hover skates in full effect, yo.  casey, give me all your photon pucks. awesome idea, donatello. now run, you moron. goongala. aah.   quickly, now. almost there. we may be too late leo. oh, no.   excellent. the dark matter regulator. oh, no, this is it the big freeze. we won't make it through this, red. we're not mutants. warmblooded or not, we're in trouble, professor. please, don't pressure me rokka rokka. g'throkka. faster, honeycutt. no time, no time.    oh, dear. oh, dear. hurrying as fast as i can. this is it  raphael.  mona, i wish i could tell you how i feel. raphael believe me. i know raphael raphael mona. what happened. you guys okay. we are grateful. hopefully one day, we can replay your kindness. yes. one day.  no time for dawdling. i've already repaired your craft. not to be rude, but we have triceratons to catch up with. mona, uh, look. what i'm trying to say is let me say if for you, raphael, in my own language:    ugh.   goodbye, mona lisa.  you'll see her again one day, raphael. i sure hope so. the triceratons are, like, million of astromiles ahead. but with a little luck, we'll catch up.  let's do this. )
