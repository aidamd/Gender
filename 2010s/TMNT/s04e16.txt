1   seriously. a temple. it's a front for a moneylaundering operation. taking it down will badly hurt the shredder. your dadwas one messedup freak.  psst. psst. wow.  well, well, well. i see we have an uninvited guest. hun. whoo. ya.      ya. you think you can take the shredder's place, but you are just a spoiled little girl.  aah.  miss me. you always have to make a dramatic entrance.  look at it all. there's millions here. shredder should've kept it somewhere a little more safe. so what are we going to do with it. do you know how much cool stuff we can buy.   teenage mutant ninja turtles teenage mutant ninja turtles teenage mutant ninja turtles heroes in a half shell, turtle power here we go, it's a lean, green ninja team on the scene, cool teens doing ninja things so extreme, out the sewer like laser beams get rocked with the shellshocked pizza kings can't stop these radical dudes the secret of the ooze made the chosen few emerge from the shadows to make their move the good guys win, and the bad guys lose   leonardo's the leader in blue does anything it takes to get his ninjas through donatello is the fellow who has a way with machines raphael's got the most attitude on the team michelangelo, he's one of a kind and you know just where to find him when it's party time master splinter taught 'em every single skill they need to be one lean, mean, green, incredible team teenage mutant ninja turtles teenage mutant ninja turtles teenage mutant ninja turtles heroes in a half shell, turtle power you enter the treasure vault when three pus trolls attack. it's a trap. ice cream kitty.  ooh, 16. the pus trolls are frozen by your ice spell. but the slime king approaches. raph. chompy is making ice cream kitty melt. that's because she's cheating. ugh, and the ice cream is getting the dice all sticky. i don't know how you talked me into playing this stupid game again. just roll, dude. okay, i attack with my fire axe. 19. your attack defeats the slime king, and you win his plustwo amulet of audacity. yes. in your face, kitty.  hey, leo, aren't you gonna play. what. oh, no, you guys go ahead. breaking news from chinatown, where a fire has burned down a mob warehouse, destroying millions in cash. some facepainted gang members arrested at the scene failed to comment.  bet you anything that place was shredder's.  dudes, look at their faces. that definitely looks like the handiwork of that crazy girl karai's running around with. should we do something. leo. not gonna defend your girlfriend, eh. whatever, raph. i'm out of here.  i don't know, donnie. i got a weird feeling leo's hiding something. like what. i'm not sure. i think he's up to something with karai.    ah, look who finally showed up. having trouble sneaking out so splinter doesn't see you. we need to be more careful, karai. you can't just go charging in like that. if i wasn't there as backup, you and shinigami might have been taken down by hun.  don't flatter yourself, leo. i had hun right where i wanted him. the purple dragons are one thing, but just us three against all of shredder's army. we should get the others. your brothers aren't interested in going after shredder's empire because splinter won't allow it. we're outnumbered. we need help. on that, we agree. omaetachi, mae e.  huh. shinigami recruited these new foot ninja from japan. but these guys are mercenaries. they're perfect for our cause and for our next target.  shredder's chemical factory. if we can destroy it, we'll cripple his organization bigtime.  so hungry. haven't eaten in an hour.   excuse me, kitty kitty mama.  what's wrong, girl. something wrong with the pizza. that sneaky dr. squirrelenstein. no. robovampires. no. the guys. leo.  i should wake him up. he'll know what to do. thanks, kitty. aah. leo. you awake. leo. oh, no. guys. guys, wake up. what is it, mikey. this better not be dr. squirrelenstein again. worse there's no sign of leo, and he's not picking up his tphone. one guess where he is. we should head to karai's. i'll run a trace on his phone. let's go.  we plant explosives, get out fast, and blow the place. shredder will never know we're here. uh, somebody will know we're here.  this isn't gonna be as easy as we heehee. gotcha, son. i sniffed you a mile away. whoohoo. oh, snap. you gooed me with my own goo. that's sick, yo.  i was hoping you would show up here, girl. let us make with the crushing already.  so the cubs recruited foot soldiers of their own. let's see if they are worthy of the name.  i didn't want it to be too easy. i think i found him. i tracked leo's tphone to auman chemicals. they must be trying to take down shredder's operation on their own. is he crazy. yeah, this sounds like something you would do, raph. whoa. hyah. heehee. don't worry about my footbots. i will finish you myself.   come get me, dinosaur. dinosaur. i am rhinoceros. whoa.  ah, bebop.  missed me. both:   we got to get out of here.  this is it. let's do this. booyaka aw, man, we missed the battle. lame, dude. they got to be here somewhere. huh. hmm.  guys, out. quick.      all: aah. raph, you okay. i think so. thanks for the save.  donnie. he's not moving.  huh. oh, no. what are they doing here. come on, leonardo. just go. i have to help donnie. what. donatello. senpai, we must go. there is no escape, young ones.   argh. footbots, after them. what are you guys doing here. what are we doing here. we were looking for you when donnie got blown up. i know how much you like to fight, but the bad guys are still out there.   hahaha. think you can run, turtles. boom, baby. hey. i want to fire lasers. they is my thing. don't mess with the party wagon. cowabunga.  dang, man. that is straightup nasty. i handle this, comrade. did no one tell turtles they is too slow.   turtles: whoa. now, to shell some turtles.  all: sensei. my sons. the factory. explosion. take him to the dojo. i will prepare the healing mantras.  sensei, wait. it's my fault. karai and i we've been taking down shredder's operations. i thought we could end this. i'm i'm sorry. i have always warned you of vengeance. i am disappointed in you, leonardo. but i am proud you had the courage to admit your wrongdoing. if i had told the others what i was up to, they never would have gone into that building. it is right that you should feel pain for your mistakes. but it is one thing to regret bad decisions after they are made. a leader must foresee how bad decisions lead to bad results.  leo, what were you thinking. i could've told you teaming up with those two was a bad idea. i don't know. i guess i thought i could control the situation. karai's gonna do what she wants to do. you're supposed to be our leader.   guys, i'm sorry. i should have told you what i was up to. i know i probably don't even deserve to lead this team after what i did. humph. karai's gonna keep going after shredder. i need your help.  leo. i didn't think you'd make it. so you're actually going against splinter's wishes. how's donatello. he'll be fine. he's a tough turtle. hey, shinigami, remember me. you're the silly one. i like you. we underestimated tiger claw's army. there's no telling how many footbots he has. we need to go after the source. a footbot factory. are you crazy. it'll be worth it. without soldiers, infiltrating shredder's secret lair will be that much easier. we don't even know where his secret lair is. i thought you liked a challenge, raphael. raph's right. i can't let you take this kind of risk. i need your help on this one, leo. for old time's sake.  sorry, karai. your charms won't work this time. we'll stop you if we have to. have it your way.  ya.  rah. well, that was a good plan.    karai is sure to attempt another attack. scan for explosives. we must protect this factory at any cost. no worries, g. we got it covered. like mayonnaise on a hot dog. even cockroach wearing the sneakers could not sneaks in. a few footbots should be no problem. we take this place down quickly before the rest are oh, no.  these don't look like footbots.  this is it. i still can't believe you were working with karai behind splinter's back. you don't have to rub it in. just saying. that sounds more like me. remember when i wanted to dress up as the nightwatcher vigilante, and you talked me out of it. you can always be turflytle's faithful sidekick maggot boy.    ya. ha.  ya. you are no match for our elite footbots, girl. do you think your thugs are true ninja.  footbots, keep them close. if the turtles arrive let them go, tiger claw.  i can always count on the hero.  i feel like i'm making a habit of saving you lately. well, maybe if you could arrive five minutes earlier look out. i like your style, witch girl. then try to keep up. i can't believe we're helping foot soldiers fight footbots.   we got to shut down these robots, or we won't stand a chance.  can't they just label the off switch. i can't believe i'm gonna say this i wish donnie were here. you are gonna pay for gooin' me, girl. you know how long it took to unstick me.  uh, over here, hornsforbrains. yo mama wears combat boots. hey. mama does wear the combat boots. heehee. stop mashing buttons. wait, i almost got it. maybe i don't got it.  there is no escape for you.   wrong move. what do you think you're doing. this. what. no. roar.  ninjas, move. stop them, you fools. karai. thanks, leo.  let me look at it. i'm fine.  whoa. i told you it was dangerous. i told you i was fine.  you okay, d. is that ringing coming from my ears or my brain.  donnie. i'm okay. wait, wait, don't touch me. no. ooh. aah. i'm hurting.  i'm sorry, father. i'm glad donatello is all right. now you see the kind of pain and suffering revenge causes. i know. i thought i could make this about taking down shredder's organization, but it's too much of a risk going after petty targets just to spite him. i promise i will no longer go after shredder's possessions. i'll go after shredder himself. )
