1x11 mousers attack. what. are you fighting a guy in slow motion. i suppose i could do it faster if i ignored my form, like you. ignore this form. competition is an excellent motivator but not when it turns you against each other. so now, you will spar two on two. okay, i'll take don you will take raphael. you two must focus on working together, not competing with each other. okay, so me and raph against mikey and donnie. uh, isn't that a little unfair. wait, what are you trying to say. um, how can i put this gently. we're way better than you guys. at fighting, maybe. uh, that's what i meant. oh. fine. hajime. ya me. you were right, sensei. working together is fun. teenage mutant ninja turtles teenage mutant ninja turtles teenage mutant ninja turtles heroes in a half shell, turtle power. here we go, it's the lean green ninja team on the scene, cool teens doing ninja things so extreme, out the sewer like laser beams get rocked with the shell shock pizza kings can't stop these radical dudes the secret of the ooze made the chosen few emerge from the shadows to make their move the good guys win and the bad guys lose. leonardo's the leader in blue does anything it takes to get his ninjas through donatello is the fellow has a way with machines raphael's got the most attitude on the team michelangelo, he's one of a kind and you know just where to find him when it's party time. master splinter taught them every single skill they need to be one lean mean green incredible team. teenage mutant ninja turtles teenage mutant ninja turtles teenage mutant ninja turtles heroes in a half shell, turtle power. the purple dragon gang agreed to raise our cut to 80%. no complaints. it seems your mutated form has its advantages. but do not forget our primary goal: locating splinter and the turtles. if i weren't stuck in here, i would have caught splinter by now. but you are stuck in there. no, no, no, no. stop that. stop that. ow. ow. stop it. stop it. i'm sure you'll have your chance to shine one of these days. master shredder might get hungry for sushi. why don't you get in the water and say that. enough, xever. bradford is right. you are useless to me this way. i'm counting on you. find me information i can use, or xever won't be the only one missing his legs. look, guys. raph and i may be better fighters, but you're still an important part of this team. hmm. as important as you two. uh, very important. we shouldn't compare ourselves. it it's like apples and oranges. yeah, if apples were way better, which they are. so the truth comes out. you guys think of us as some kind of bteam. good one, dr. nameenstein. we'll call you the bteam. thanks. i mean, hey. there's no shame in it. look, they've got a bteam too. we'll need backup. you two in the shirts you're coming with us. rodriguez and that other guy they're gone. well, that's why we bring them along. thanks a lot. the point is, they had an important function. april, what's wrong. are you okay. i just got mugged by some purple dragons. they stole my phone. don't worry. we'll kick their butts for you. yeah, we'll teach those punks to mess with april o'neil. guys, it's just a phone. i'll get another one. come on. what's the point of being a ninja if you can't help your friends when they get robbed. april is right. it is best to let this go. what do you mean. why shouldn't we get her phone back. one cannot predict the consequences of battle. every fight has the potential to stir a hornet's nest. a simple cell phone does not justify this risk. what risk. it's the purple dragons. even mikey and donnie could beat 'em. hey. hey. don't worry, sensei. we'll be careful. eh. what ya gonna do. hope my next pupil is more obedient. right in the shell. let's see you beat that. watch and learn. oh, that's it. no more bets. come on, your luck'll turn around. the turtles. 'sup. waaaa. get 'em. hiyah. bring it. comin' through. i got it. hiyah. let's get out of here. what. you punks stole a phone from a friend of ours. we want it back. whatever. we steal a lot of phones. well, let's see 'em. now. hey, that looks like it. does anyone else feel that. what's going on. what the heck. hey, those things are stealing the stuff we stole. wait, where's he's got the phone. bteam, get him. we'll handle the metal. hey, we are just go. if you guys can't handle it, don't be ashamed to call for help. oh, yeah. well, maybe you should call us for help. or don't call us. we'll call you. wait, i mean i think they got it. come on. let's see where these things are coming from. what is it. one of our guys jacked this earlier tonight. then those turtles came looking for it, said it belongs to a friend of theirs. really. aww, man. we can't take dogpound on our own. maybe we should wait for leo and raph. and tell them we chickened out. then they'll never stop calling us the bteam. we'll use stealth. with the right plan, we can grab the phone without dogpound ever seeing us. okay. well done, my pretties. dexter spackman. it's baxter stockman. i was close. so you're here to stop me again. well, you don't stand a chance against my m. o. u. s. e. r. s. mousers. mobile offensive underground search, excavation, and retrieval sentries. seems a little forced. since my test robbery was successful, it's time to move on to bigger targets. these are about to make me very, very rich. and we're gonna make you very, very hurt. acid. protect your eyes. wait. we're fine. you're right. get him. get me. no, you will be the ones who will be getting got. gotten. get them. ha. all gone. good thing i made extra. i'm calling it. time to go. i'll allow it. you can't run forever. soon, the mousers will crush your bones in their jaws. such is the fate of anyone foolish enough to trifle with baxter stock we need a diversion, so we can grab the phone. how about this. we'll make them think the police are here. we'll need a bullhorn, some flashing lights, and a siren. operation: cop out. or we can make them think the place is on fire. we'll need a smoke machine, an orange light, and some firefighter jackets. operation: burn out. or we could find the breaker box and shut off the power. we'll need um, nothing. operation: blackout. no, lights out. no, power out. this one's too good, i can't handle it. you think we lost them yet. i'd say no. how are those things tracking us. it's gotta be that stuff he sprayed us with. all right, we better call donnie. you want to get bailed out by the bteam. forget that. maybe we won't have to. whatever this stuff is, we'll just wash it off. cold. that ought to do it. of course, we could call donnie just to say hi. i've got it. i'll use my tphone to hack the cia computer system, then reroute a satellite over the building and focus its beams to give them all splitting headaches. operation: spaced out. that's when you go in, wearing a tinfoil hat to protect yourself i'm kind of in the middle of something. is that leo. tell him my operation names. what's the matter. oh, don't tell me the ateam needs our help. uh, no. no, of course not. no, we're we're great. ii'm just, you know, checking to see if you guys need any help. we got this. we followed fong to the defunct futon factory on fifth. say that five times fast. anyway, we've got an awesome plan to get the phone back. how are you guys doing. uh, you know. good ish. whoops, call waiting. gotta go. you were right. we've got to beat these things on our own if it kills us. uh okay, bad choice of words. can't you unlock it. it's encrypted or something. uh, nice doggy. this guy used his little robots to steal from us, which means he's stealing from you. i don't have time for this. get rid of him. i've got turtles to find. wait. turtles. i hate those guys. i can help. in fact, i'm already helping. explain. my mousers are destroying the turtles as we speak. uh, two of them, at least. so you make robots. you must be good with electronics. the best. there's nothing i can't build, hack, or fix. could you hack into this phone. you insult me, sir. something so easy would be a waste of my talents. well, then, start wasting your talents before i waste you. okay, let's do this. bteam is go. don't call us that. oh, right. look, raph, mouserkebabs. these things are a cakewalk. now. i could do this all day. same here. raph. that was so fun. it's almost too much fun. there. my decryption program is ready. what's going on. the phone. well, that plan didn't work. worked great for me. get the chains. we'll have access to the phone in about ten minutes. you're wasting your time. there's nothing on it. it's got a gps log, doesn't it. once i unlock this phone, we'll see every place it's ever been. the museum of natural history. or the lair. even worse. if that phone tells me where splinter is, i'll have no reason to keep you alive. and if it doesn't tell me, i'll get the answers out of you. that's what i call a winwin. okay, this is crazy. maybe we should call we can do this. i got an idea. up here, metal mouth. told you we didn't need those guys. oh, come on. okay, i admit it. i wish donnie were here. i bet he could find a way to get these things off our tail. make the call. no. ooh. we'll check these next. tphones, selfdestruct. mikey's not answering either. something's wrong. i should've known they'd need us to bail them almost done. and processing, processing. come on. and finished. the turtles. not so fast, dogpound. and dexter spackman. baxter stockman. how did you escape my mousers. we didn't. we're here to save the day, as usual. oh, yeah. looks like you guys were doing great. you try fighting off 2,000 robots. let's beat it. mikey. keep away. whoa. a gamma camera. it detects radioisotopes. that must be what he's tagged you with. oh. how do we get it off. you can't. it wears off gradually. but if someone else got sprayed, they'd give off a stronger signal. we gotta get stockman's spray. it controls the mousers. you mean that thing. i'll handle this, dog man. one spritz and they're mouser chow. hang it up, dogpound. your call just got dropped. oh, yeah. nice job, guys. yeah, from here on out, you're the "a" team. that's probably the best we're gonna get out of him. hey. guys. i hope you all see that by choosing your own battles poorly, you created your own crisis. yeah, there's definitely some irony there. okay, it got a little out of control, but we learned our lesson. and at least we got april's phone back. you did. sweet. uh, the important thing is it didn't end up in the wrong hands. gee. thanks, guys. uh, don't worry, april. you can have one of my custombuilt tphones. ooh, cool. just don't say, "tphone, selfdestruct. " or else that happens. ow. hey, let go. here he is, master. baxter stockman. your interference has cost me the turtles and splinter. you should pay with your life. fortunately for you, i may have use for your skills. )
