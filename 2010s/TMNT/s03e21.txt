last time. we couldn't even get through the front door. all we need is better stealth. which leads me to present my latest invention. what's with the mess. that's my latest invention. the mark x1 experimental allterrain urban stealth vehicle. you invented a dumpster. that's the point, raph. it's supposed to blend in perfectly with um the other trash littering new york city. come on, let's test it out. i thought you were fixing the turtle mech. how's this thing gonna help us. look, if you wanna break into shredder's lair, this baby's the thing to use, not a giant lumbering robot they can see coming from a mile away. the foot will never see us dude. it's got full flushing action. nice. worst. invention. ever. ugh, and i thought this thing smelled bad on the outside. okay, guys. let's do this. remember the plan. we break into shredder's lair, steal one of those brain worms. donnie reverseengineers it, and we save karai. doesn't sound too hard. any slower and this thing would be going in reverse. is it me, or is this thing getting heavier the more we peddle. mikey, check the periscope. aye, aye, captain. uh, we got a stowaway, cap'n. he's eating a chocolog. i love chocologs. what. give me that. whazzafrazza. firing sausage cannon. here they come, dude. here comes number two. i got this one. you see. no fuss, no muss. the perfect city stealth vehicle. now let's head for stockman's lab and capture a brain worm. stealth only, ninjas. whoa. sorry, sorry. i'm sorry. almost to the lab. we're gonna make it this time. ugh. oh, dang. we got some tresspassin' turtles up in here. surprise, turtle freaks. this time we squashes you heads like blueberries. four turtles versus two complete morons. we got this. well, well, well. i see the gathering has just begun. leonardo, i am going to savor tearing the shell off of your body. you can try, catman. you wanna take on my sweet moves, bebop. bring it on. ninja, please. oooohooooo. anyone ever tell you rhinos have terrible aim. you just had to tick him off. ah. oh, not these freaks again. guys, there's too many of them. get out of here. retreat. tactical retreat. block the doors. do not let them escape. ah. raph. raph. booyakashaaa. you two idiots couldn't even perform one simple task. what happened. turtle scum, trying to sneak into lairs again. we drove them away, master shredder. i assure you we can handle them. if the turtles break in here again, i assure you i will handle all of you. hold still, raph. i think it's sprained. you're gonna have to stay off your feet for awhile and heal up. i'll heal later. right now, i'm down for a little sweet revenge. you proved your foolishness once, there is no need to prove it again. sensei, we have to get one of those brain control worms. it's the only way donnie can create a cure for karai. i appreciate the effort. but you must remember your lives are just as important to me, my sons. and because of that, no missions until raphael's leg heals. what. not again. don't sideline the rest of the team cause i'm down, sensei. i have made my decision. rest and get well, my son. sorry, guys. don't worry about it, raph. we can't rely on technology to get us in there. so what are you proposing then. there were too many of us. i need to go alone without tech. solo. solo. leo. phew. mikey, what are you doing here. backing you up, brah. it's too dangerous. it's better if i go alone. dude, i just straight ninja'd you, son. you had no idea i was up here. i don't care what you say. i'm going. i'm here for you, dude. all right then. let's capture a brain worm. yes. ah. there they are. caught ya, suckers. i've been losing a lot of beauty sleep cause of you turtles. da. shredder making us keep the eye out 24/7. is no fun. is boring. easy, fellas. look, we're putting our hands up. i say we make the turtle borscht. best idea i heard all day. do your dealio, steranko. wait. i thinking maybe mutagen soup instead. i love that idea, g. everyone can relax. casey jones is finally here. leo and mikey are gone, and they're not picking up their tphones. we better check it out. i'll lead the team we know where they went. shredder's lair. you are going nowhere, raphael. where are your brothers. that's a good questions, sensei. you're gonna make one freaky twoheaded mutant turtle. i can't wait to see this. what, you just wanna make a turtle mutant. that's boring. why not throw more stuff in the mutagen. create a super mutant. hmm, i like that idea. let's add something to spice up the mix. like shrimpy over there. why not add more. leo, what are you doing. stalling for time. maybe up ante. we make turtle, shrimp, crab, and lobster mutant. come here, little buddies. it's dinner time, freaks. oh, we creates the fivestar megamutant, da. you messed up big time, steranko. i blame you. it was a stupid idea. let's go. ah. run. run. it's some kind of megashredder. ah. is it a blob thing from outer space or a product of science gone awry. nobody knows, but one thing is certain, stay indoors, and stay tuned for more on this edition of grody to the max. is it just me, or does something about that monster look kind of familiar. a little. we got to do something, now. go. find your brothers. save the city. ah. raph, with your leg, are you up for this. if i got to walk on my hands, we are taking that thing down. hm. maybe we can use something else to help you walk. we got to distract it away from the people. you're going down, mega shredder. yeah, boy. aw, man look at that thing, steranko. we are in some deep bacon fat. i blames you, comrade bebop. is 'nother fine mess you has gotten us into. ugh. booyakabooyakasha. ugh. ah. mikey. ah. ah. d yes. way more awesome than video games. readying more explosives. fire. arming missile launchers. whoa. ah. i need something to hold onto. not what i meant. incoming. donnie, how do we stop that thing. what do we do. i don't know. press more buttons. ah. get this thing moving. now. let's see how he likes a hot mouth. ah. whoa. it's the tongue, leo. the brain is the tongue. i'm on it. now it's worse. how do we stop this thing. how am i supposed to know. mikey's the kaiju fan. where is he. hmm. huh. cowabunga. mikey, i can't believe it. booyakasha. now's our chance to finish this thing. fire. pretty awesome, guys. and we even captured a brain worm. not a bad day after all. but boss. it was turtles' faults. they sabotaged mutagen. we tried to stop them, mr. shredder. pig's honor. i tire of this. tiger claw, further their education in pain. as you command, master. just watch the goggles, cool. it's kind of my thing. )
