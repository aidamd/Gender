if you are in the mood for a story. very well. when i was a young man, i fell in love with a woman. oh, hey, is it that late. sit. her name was tang shen. and i was not the only one who loved her. there was another man competing for her attention oroku saki. shredder. one day, he insulted me in front of her. he called me many things. i felt i could not let those insults go unanswered. i lost my temper. and over time, our rivalry festered into hatred until shredder sought to finish me and i lost my beloved tang shen. butbut it wasn't your fault. shredder insulted you. you had no choice. no choice. i could have chosen to ignore him. i could have chosen to let his words wash over me like a river over stone. but i let him anger me. it was i who made his words into weapons. that's the choice i made. what choice will you make. we're here. are we really gonna do this without raph. we can handle it. i don't know. it just feels like something's missing. ow. thanks. happy to help. let's go. spiders. ow. you don't have to keep doing that. there was a spider on you. well, there's a spider on you too. no, there isn't. come here, you punk. knock it off. ow. hey. shh. the image that is

i'll drop it down to $500,000. and you can keep the phone. okay, $400,000. this is our fight with the creatures called the turtles. the usefulness of this will be proven usefully with the more watching of this. also this is being a good image of kraang. we should be showing the image of kraang to kraang. we're gonna get you out of here. what about my phone. shh. don't shush me. i ain't leaving here without my phone. stop the one that needs to be stopped. stop. remind me why we have to rescue this guy. whoo. hyah. huh. got it. kraang, go look at the place where the thing that makes the noise is, and tell us what thing makes that noise in that place. i don't like the sound of that. i don't like the look of it either. what did you do to me. i'm hideous. don't worry. the four of us can handle him. okay, this might be a bad time to point this out, but you sent one of the four of us home. and right now, i wish it was me. this is your fault. i'm gonna rip your heads off. all right, guys, prepare to dish out the mighty wrath of justice. seriously, just yell, "get him." get ooh. is that all you've got. the answer i was looking for was "yes.
