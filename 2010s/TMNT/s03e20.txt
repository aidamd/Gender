splinter taught 'em every single skill they need to be one lean, mean, green, incredible team teenage mutant ninja turtles teenage mutant ninja turtles teenage mutant ninja turtles heroes in a half shell, turtle power yokai. shredder. this cannot be.     sakisan, what were they. i do not know, but i will find out.  phew. close call, dudes. awesome save by mikey, thank you very much. oroku saki was part of the hamato clan before he became the shredder. so we're at least 16 years in the past. but why here. why now. who knows. all renet's fault. she doesn't know the first thing about time travel. yo, guys, check it.  that's splinter's old dojo, right. come on, ninjas, maybe splinter's in there.  i saw it with my own eyes. they were small green men in strange costumes. clearly the yokai of legend.  yokai. your imagination has run wild, saki.  whoa. human splinter. he looks so weird without fur.  small green men. spirits. monsters. your head has always been in the clouds, brother.  do not be too dismissive of the supernatural world, yoshi. there are many dimensions, many beings that permeate what we call reality. my apologies, father. please continue, saki. let us hear more of this interesting tale. do not mock me, yoshi. i know what i saw.  some legends say when the yokai arrives, tragedy is sure to follow. dudes, these yokai sound like trouble. he's talking about us, genius. yokai are mythical japanese monsters.  i tell you, yoshi, we all saw them. it reminds me of the yokai friends we invented as children. remember, saki.  you never listen to me. just like tang shen. yet again you speak of shen. you care nothing for her. only for the clan, only for yourself.   that is not true, brother. i have always been there for you.  what.  ugh. we haven't had any real food in days.  a turtle can't live on berries alone, bros. i'm feeling weak.  is renet ever gonna find us and bring us home. seriously. i hate time travel. i've been giving it some thought. kinda seems like more than just coincidence we're here, right. well, the odds we're in this exact time and place by sheer accident is like 879 quintillion to 1. but if we're here for a reason, what is it. mm. beautiful night, isn't it. it is nights like this that i realize how lucky i am to have you and little miwa.  yoshi, let's leave this place. move away from here. i've always wanted to visit america. new york city. shen i have many responsibilities. you know this. with father being ill, the dojo the dojo when are you going to leave that life behind. this is the last clan of its kind. and that is why it must endure. must i explain this again. ninjas have no more place in this world. you must decide. this is no life for miwa. if she ever followed your path shen. let me walk you home. i can take care of myself. i always have.   so hungry.   what the heck are you doing. baking a pizza. berries, spider eggs, and worms on a thin slice of bark, covered in mud sauce. mmm, mmm, mmm. here, raph, try a bite.     yokai. hmm.  it's okay, it's okay, we're not gonna hurt you. yeah, we're friendly yokai. check out the cute eyes.  hyah. mikey, we need an exit. i'm out of smoke bombs, dude.    fear not, shen. i will destroy these wretched monsters. hyah. hyah.   now's our chance. we can change the future. we can take shredder down. no. we can't mess with time. worse stuff could happen.   are you all right, shen. yes, thanks to you. i would never let anything hurt you. i overheard your conversation with yoshi. it is futile, you know. he will never leave the clan. perhaps you speak the truth. shen, take me back. i will help you take care of miwa. we will go to new york together, the three of us. i'm a different man than the one you once knew. believe me.   whoa. young oroku saki is kind of a good guy, right. are you crazy. he's a total creep. maybe we should take shredder down. if we interfere with history, splinter will never move to new york and buy four baby turtles. and then who's gonna stop the kraang invasion, and save all of new york. huh. but we've already interfered with history. shredder just saved tang shen from four monsters. us. wait a second.  casey's picture is fading away like we never knew him. time is already being altered. it's just like that movie. we're doomed, dudes. doooomed. calm down, man. we just gotta make sure that tang shen doesn't like oroku saki. we have to convince her he's the evil jerk we all know and hate, so history stays on course. hajime.  i saw you with her last night in the woods, brother. what did you say to shen. what concern is it of yours, yoshi. shen is my concern, saki.   enough. end this now. you are brothers. act like brothers. here she comes. tang shen. tang shen. hold on. we come in peace.  lala lala dodo dodo do dodo do dadada dada da tada.  oh it's okay, tang shen. we promise we won't hurt you. are you aliens or yokai. we're, um, friendly yokai, shen. we need to talk to you.  i was raised in fukuoka but my grandfather is chinese. i moved here to be closer to yoshi. i've heard yokai are always hungry. that's why i made a meal all kappas love. kappa. what's a kappa. turtle yokai. and your favorite food is cucumber. at least that's what the legends say. cucumber. little known fact our favorite food is pizza. thick crust, thin crust, no crust hook a turtle up. my grandmother told me the story of a kappa that came out of the river as a young girl was fetching water. the kappa terrified her. but the girl always carried cucumbers with her to ward off yokai. the kappa was so thankful, it told her of a great hurricane that would devastate her village. it saved her people. that's right, and we want to save you, tang shen. which is why we, um, kappa have come to talk. we also bring you, um, dire news.  you can't leave hamato yoshi. he's a good man. oroku saki is evil. no. saki is a good man. if you choose oroku saki, the world itself could be at risk. take it from us, the kappa brothers. yoshi is too dedicated to ninjitsu to raise a family. that's not true. splinter loves little miwa.  she's so cute. i don't know who i will choose. i must do what's right for my daughter.  follow your heart, shen. you know who the better man is. please, let me get you more cucumbers.  um, leo.  what's the plan now. the only noble thing we can do is finish shredder once and for all.  the hamato clan has gotten weak. it is rotting from the inside. the foot was the oldest of all ninja clans. but it was wiped out by hamato yuuta when he slain its master, oroku keiji my father.  i was adopted by the hamato clan as an infant. raised by my enemy in ignorance. i will have my revenge on them all. huh. yokai. finish them, quickly. i have business to attend to.   i am sorry, shen. you and miwa are my life. without you, i am a shadow. yoshi, i understand your loyalty to the clan. father is growing worse. the dojo is all we have left. you have so much more than that, yoshi. my love for you and miwa burns inside my heart brighter than all the stars in the universe.  pathetic. i will not abide by this dishonor. saki. shen, i ask you one last time. make the right choice. i have already made it.  take miwa and go, shen. but, yoshi, saki, please. you are brothers. no, we were never blood. shen, go now. how can one love and hate someone so fiercely. if your desire is to fall by my hand, brother so be it.    ah.  booyakasha.   mmm, mmm. mmm, i'm starting to get a taste for these things. that's right, ninja. we yokai will steal all of your souls through your butt.  hyah.  whoo.    through your butt. what. that comes from real japanese legend. come on, let's head for the dojo.  we were raised together, saki. do not make me fight you. how could i not after so many lies. after so much dishonor.  you only dishonor yourself. you were always jealous. always scheming. always filled with hate.    guys, you see that.   fire.  please, brother, do not make me do this.  saki, this whole place is coming down. then we shall both perish here.   tang shen.  shen, wait. whoa. we have to get in there.    please, stop.  shen.   you will be mine to care for now, little one. i will call you karai.  splinter.     shen.   everything's back to normal finally. except for the part where we're stuck thousands of miles from home and 16 years in the past.  we might as well get used to it, guys. maybe being a yokai won't be so bad.   ah.  yes. finally, i found you. renet. heh, it's good to see you too, mikey.  where have you been. we've been stuck here for days. it's not my fault, seriously. i've spent, like, the last six months trying to hunt you guys down. why. why did we have to come here. of all times. of all places. it was the scepter. it brought you here to make sure splinter survived. wait. so it's always been this way. we were always destined to come here in time and save splinter's life. ugh, can you just take us home now. my head is starting to hurt. no problem. future new york, here we come. will we ever see you again, renet. let's hope not.  maybe some day, michelangelo. uh goodbye, turtle warriors. see you in history. let's go home, guys. it'll be good to see master splinter. )
