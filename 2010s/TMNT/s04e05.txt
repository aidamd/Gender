blanketing the planet, sir. but i believe the fragment is located somewhere on this continent. assemble an away team. do not alert central command to our location. it will be mozar who finds the fragment. they can't see us on radar, right, fugitoid. you sure this is gonna work. the triceratons are convinced the first piece of the black hole generator is on that planet. we just need to reach it first. i'm just gonna say it now. something's not right about this mission. activating cloak. better work this time, donnie. finally, a little excitement. it's been like a whole week since

paradise planet in the universe. it is gorgeous down there. ah, fugidude. well, i am, you know, occasionally wrong. teenage mutant ninja the evil triceratons have invaded earth. they brought with them

understand these readings at all. whoa. aww. little space monkey, catrat thing. aren't you, uh, cute. ah. nice one, genius. now you probably have space rabies. space rabies. this world, it was once a vast, beautiful garden. it held ancient repositories of all the sacred knowledge in the cosmos. not a single piece of technology was ever built here. the aeons must've fled. without their divine power, look at this world. what are aeons. powerful, ancient aliens. the first beings to evolve in the universe. now they've all gone away. this energy is really screwing up my readings. ah. so fix it, genius. i thought you were supposed to be the smart one. that's right, i am. which clearly makes you the stupid one. ha. that definitely makes raph the angry one. i'm clearly the handsome one. here, check it out. i got something for you. ah. ha. you're the gullible one. i'm tired of you picking on me. ever since we were little, you've been giving me shell wedgies, wet willies, and reptile rug burns, and mikey, raph, enough. we're on a serious mission here. so stop it. huh. everyone take cover. hey. ah. phew. very strange. these creatures are definitely not native to this planet. yah. let's just move. now we got demon bats and triceratons to deal with. i hate outer space so, so much. we should have just beamed down. the planet's energy blocks off the outside world. no matter. find the fragment, or i will leave you behind on this nightmarish world. i have a reading. this way, sir. well, this isn't good. we're going around in circles. ah. we've been walking for miles, donnie.

you two cut it out. you're more annoying than raph. that's it. ah. oh. get off of him, man. whoa, what are you doing. professor, a little help. ah. ugh. you must all stop. don't make me smack you. you see this. this is my smacking hand. i'll use it. he's right, guys. what the heck is wrong with us. we have more important stuff to deal with. like this. must be from some sort of ancient civilization. duh. a mountain with a sun at its peak carved in the shape of a gemstone. what could it mean. those guys are like the pinnacle of extreme metal. phew. too close. thank goodness they're they're not gone, are they. ah. ugh. ah. ah. mikey. you're in my anger zone. ah. ah. ah, whoa. you're blocking my shot, donnie. ugh. whoa. leo, hold on. booyakasha. i could've handled it. mikey. ah. ugh. my my

the rage. it's so hard to control. then focus it on the demon dudes. there's too many. run for your very lives. they're closing in, dudes. ah. whoa, what just happened. that statue. yes. thank you, statue. you are awesome. what is it, professor. some kind of mystical guardian. it's a depiction of the aeons. the beings that fled this world. guess the demons drove them off a long time ago. well, that's a total bummer. bummer. look what happened to their world. you have about as much sensitivity as a rabid dog. look, just because you're leader doesn't mean you have to get into everyone's face. don't start on that leader thing again, raph. you've always been jealous of me. jealous. maybe that's because you were always splinter's favorite. ah. raph, i love you, bro. leo, ii'm sorry. i don't understand what's going on. the planet. it keeps messing with our heads. we gotta remember that. we have to focus. guys, did you notice something. the statue. it's pointing. well, let's see where it takes us. fools. i should throw you all into the triarena for such incompetence. where is my fragment. gah. bah. your technology is worthless here. captain mozar, sir, it is the planet that is infuriating you, not our technolo ah. next time it will be you, zarus. i'm getting a signal, sir. it appears to be a cyborg. the fugitoid. he must be after the fragment as well. track him, lieutenant zovox, and pray you do not lose him. that is one dope alien temple, yo. i bet you this place is loaded with booby traps. eh, what's the worst that could happen. wow, amazing. it's definitely alien. what does it say, professor. it's in ancient aeoneon. "when the soul star, uh, reaches the mountain's peak, uh, the light of the aeons shall illuminate all. " what the heck does that mean. yo, check it out. what do you think this does. casey, no. oh, dear. it does that, you big dummy. ah. ah. mikey. ah. whoa. whoa. whoa. phew. casey. stop touching stuff. that was completely my bad. there it is. the first piece of the black hole generator. yes, we did it. wait, wait, hold up. what's it doing on an altar, anyway. has anyone thought of that. who cares. we found it first. we rule. whoohoo. awesome. oh, yeah. by the luck of the great zanmoran. not only does mozar find the fugitive android, he collects the first fragment of his prize. obliterate them. booyakasha. ah. wretched alien. oh, my cog. ah. at last. hmm. what. ah. the first fragment belongs to mozar. it has been set in stone. no. and now it is sealed in stone. triceratons, back to the ships. ugh low on power. we must find another way out. when i get my hands on those hornheaded freaks come on, there's gotta be a back door or something. it is mine to possess. the emperor will make me an admiral for this. captain mozar, look. come on, give me something. trap door, secret passage. we're losing time. they're getting away. ugh. april. i'm okay. what is it, professor. it's the soul star. the symbol of the aeons, containing the power of life itself. so it was hidden away and the world turned evil. i get it now. when the soul star reaches the mountain's peak, the light of the aeons shall illuminate all. so what does it mean. it means we put it where it belongs. huh. back on top of the temple. back to the ship. we have the fragment. if we can reach the top, i think it'll drive off the demons. at least, i hope. you hope. you could be totally wrong. give her a chance, raph. we have to oh, no. here they come, dudes. move. no. the triceratons are getting away. we have to do this. it's not just about saving earth. it's about saving all worlds. toss me the crystal. hurry, raphael. whoo. almost there. ah. raph. whoa. donnie, catch. no. ugh. go, april, go. ah. ugh. it's working. oh, it feels like a huge weight off my brain. whoa. the the aeons. whoa, look at that. thank you. you saved us from ourselves. yourselves. the demons were the aeons all along. the utrom gave us the fragment to protect, but its immense power entranced us. we aeons had never allowed technology on our world before. we desired to know its secrets. we began to worship its technological power, and hid away our beloved soul, thus, corrupting our world, and us with it. we became monstrous, horrible things, and when we hid away our star, the evil was complete. thank you, friends, for saving our world. take this gift. it is a tiny fragment of our soul star. it will bring you both luck and power. wow, it's beautiful. goodbye, glowy dudes. floor it, fugitoid. there's still time to catch up to the triceratons. whoa, bros, what an adventure. the utrom made a big mistake when they trusted the fragment with those guys. yeah, if ancient, cosmic beings can be transformed like that, i guess that goes to show anyone can be corrupted by power. )
