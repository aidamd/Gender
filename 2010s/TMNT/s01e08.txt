" i'm guessing that guy lost a lot of wars.  you see. mercy. ow. okay, look. compassion is great. but the purple dragons are not going to leave murakami alone. so we'll track down the dragons and make sure they got the message. and if they didn't, we'll send them one. special delivery. was that meant to sound tough or stupid. how are we gonna track someone down when we can't talk to anybody. i'm looking for the purple dragons. i don't know what you're talking about. don't worry, i can protect you. i'm an undercover cop. you look like you're 16. i know. i'm really good at this. whoa.  let me see a badge. are you crazy. i can't carry a badge. that would blow my cover. i suppose that makes sense. april said this was the place. cool. can we get tattoos. i want to get one of my face on my face. it'll be like i'm wearing a mask and the mask is me. i just blew your minds, right. you know they use needles for that. can it, dorks. there he is. we saw that gang of turtles you were looking for. and we'll tell you where, for a price. freeze, dirt bags. uhoh. i think we can find them ourselves. oh, man. this is awkward. it's chris bradford, my exfriend. and that other guy. the name is xever. so you don't forget, i'll write it on your shells with these.   ugh. you're making me sorry i let you go. ah.  turtles, fall back. we're giving up. again. you kidding me. yes, it's all part of my hilarious "let's all live" routine. hey. stay and fight, you coldblooded cowards. man, could that fight have been any more embarrassing. sure. we could have been hit in the face with pies.  it's called fighting smart, raph. the purple dragons have bradford and xever on their side now. last time, we barely beat those guys. yeah, because they're willing to fight to the finish. the only way to beat them is to be just as ruthless as they are. raphael, this xever can cross lines that you won't. this may make him dangerous, but it does not make him strong. but xever wins fights. isn't that what matters. and he never shows anyone mercy. please, please. i helped you find the turtles, didn't i. idiota. you led them to our hideout.  so much for your street connections. you really think these common hoodlums can tell us anything useful. they'd better. where'd you see those turtles. the east village. some old man's noodle shop. murakami's. we were roughing him up and they jumped in to protect him. oh, did they. big deal. how are you going to make sure the turtles don't get away again. easy. i'll give them a reason to stay. april, what's wrong. it's murakami. someone took him and left this. sweet. free knife. the note, dummy. "no more running. if you want the old man, meet us on the roof of the fortune cookie factory. " well, what are we waiting for. let's bust in there and save murakami. not so fast. think, raphael. there's two words that don't usually go together. this is obviously a trap. well, what choice do we have. maybe we do need to think more like xever. but master splinter said i know. but xever crossed the line dragging murakami into this. he's got to learn that we can cross the line too. no more mr. nice turtle. yes. i never liked mr. nice turtle. okay, he's strong, so speed and stealth are essential. okay, everybody know the plan. mikey. yes. are you sure. yes. tell me what it is. um maybe we should go over it one more time. gentlemen, welcome to the other side of the line. now i'm definitely going to need a tat. ow. dang, this sucker's heavy.  sorry. don't apologize to him. i mean, sorry i didn't drop you harder. there you go. cozy in there.  good. uhoh, you guys. look. dude, xever's a jerk. we're here, xever. now let the noodle man go. sorry, there's been a change of plans. actually, there's been another change of plans. i love it when a change of plans comes together. you let our friend go and we'll let your friend go.  he's not my friend. uh, we're not kidding. okay, sstop or we'll toss him. go ahead. it'll save me the trouble.  uh, raph. aw, crud. that's what i thought. attack.   huh.  how could you be so sure they were bluffing. i wasn't. way. all right. let's settle the score, pond scum. we're the ones who didn't want to throw you off the roof.  raph.   see, bradford. that is how you catch turtles. and next, i'll show you how to filet them. you'd never have caught them without me and you know it. oh, yes. what would we have done without your brave leadership from inside the trash can. now, if you'll excuse me, it's time to cut these turtles into little pieces. i don't think so. aah. i got him. nice save, mikey. don't look down, murakamisan. or, um, listen down. accept this token of my gratitude. pizza gyoza. awesome. thanks, murakamisan. you're welcome, turtlesan. wait, how did you i do have other senses. touch, smell. you don't think we're weird and scary. you saved my life. who am i to complain. just try one. sometimes things that don't seem like they go together actually make a great couple. i mean, food.  fine. whoa. these are amazing. huh. you boys showed your strength today. yeah, but we almost got beaten. your strength was mercy. that is why the purple dragon helped you. well. say it. okay, okay. you were right. ahh, see. that wasn't so your wimpiness might not be totally useless. ohho. i'll show you who's wimpy. no mercy. this is unacceptable. humble apologies, master shredder. i swear, next time, we will enough. i shall deal with hamato yoshi's disciples myself. )
