before some random joe ends up mutated. this way. found it. how many does that bring us up to. but look at the bright side: only 63 more to go. so the turtles are hunting for the missing mutagen supply. this makes the game so much easier. teenage mutant ninja turtles teenage mutant ninja turtles teenage mutant ninja turtles heroes in a half shell, turtle power. here we go, it's the lean green

fight exactly like you fight, but the whole point is to make it to the dragon gate any way we can, right. i don't know, sensei. maybe i'm not cut out for all this. i don't really think the guys respect me. i just i just want to be a good leader, you know. leonardo, a true leader doesn't always impose his will but helps his followers flourish, grow. maybe i shouldn't be leading the team. my son, how can your brothers believe in you as leader if you do not believe in yourself. enough. the kraang swore that these new foot soldiers would be deadly. they were true to their word. i thought they'd finish me off, but you wouldn't let them do that, right, father. i am leaving for japan to take care of urgent business. you are not to make any moves against the turtles until i return. but i told you disobedience comes with a stiff penalty, child. even for your daughter. especially for my daughter. you're not mad at us, are you, leo. i'll give you mutant pus monsters 23 if you're not mad. i'm not mad. i just think you guys need to be a little better at following my orders. aw, it's too bad i can't play my violin while i drive. what's your problem lately, raph. you still jealous you're not leading the team. stop the shellraiser. scanner's picked up another mutagen canister. we're close, guys. signal's coming from the basement. okay, let's not make any sudden moves before i give the orders. hmm. oh, yeah. found it. go, ninja. go, ninja, go. don't. see. if you would listen to me easier than i thought. karai. long time, eh, leo. your lady friend's getting really good at setting ambushes. ha, they're just foot soldiers. won't even break a sweat. they armored up or something. everybody, fall back. what. we're running away. it's not running. it's a tactical retreat. move. i don't care what leo says. i don't run from the foot. this way. go, go, go. off of me, you bugeyed creep. those guys are robots. move your shell, donnie. go. hurry, leo. leo. he's gone, and it's all my fault. we didn't follow his lead. how are we gonna explain this to master splinter. explain what to me, michelangelo. it's leo, sensei. karai captured him. hmm. i knew it would come to this eventually. come to what, sensei. karai wants to take revenge. she believes that i took one of her loved ones away from her. but it's not true, right. it is very much the opposite of what she thinks. find leonardo. that is what is important right now. rescue your brother. you know i bet i'd make a small fortune if i sold you to a science lab. could you imagine the press. "talking ninja turtle found in sewer. " sweet. captured and now totally humiliated. awesome day, leo. awesome day. you deserve everything you're getting, leo, after you betrayed me last time. don't you love it. my new robotic foot bots follow my orders to a "t. " no arguing, no prodding. they do whatever i want. cool, right. yeah, convenient. nice. i've been teaching the foot bots new skills, but now i'm turning the training over to someone new. foot bots deshell him. you spend years learning a fighting style, and my robots learn it in seconds from you. fighting just improves their skills. karai. i never got to know my mother because your rodent master took her away from me. splinter. that's a lie. get him out of my sight. karai, listen to me. splinter would never hurt your mother. okay, so i hacked into some security footage. there, it's karai's van. they took leo to the bradford dojo. let's do this. wait, so you're leader now. whoa, whoa, whoa, hold up. i'm the smartest, so look, let's not argue about this. leo needs us, and listen, this time, we fight how leo wanted us to fight, the way he fights. can't sneak in. security camera. no sweat. i got this. it's not just one. the entire roof is bracketed by surveillance. we can't understand what you're trying to say, leo. it's a trap. nice, leo. you could've said something. you got two choices, sweetheart: let us go, or walk away from this inside a sandwich bag. sorry, raphael. can't let you go. it's not really that personal with the rest of you turtles. i just need you for bait. she wants splinter. your sensei will eventually track you here, and when he shows up, splinter will know what it's like to truly suffer. restrain them. let's smash some robots. they're only 1000 time better at fighting than regular foot. hmm. my foot bots know every move every skill every attack. we're out of real estate. if i order you to run away, will you guys listen this time. heck yeah. and we can still call it a tactical retreat if you want. foot bots, don't let them escape. all our moves are useless. they know every move i can make, every fighting style, skill, every wait a sec. remember king of the mountain. yeah, sure. what about it. oh, i get what you're saying: be unpredictable do our thing. didn't see that coming, did you. yeah, boy. i never had so much fun following your orders. we're even. i've never had so much fun giving them. you might as well give up now. the more you fight those foot bots, the more they adapt. your robots may know my moves, but you don't. fool. a ninja never throws away their weapon. that's the point. think you've won. whoa. whoa. fall. shredder is lying to you. splinter would never hurt an innocent. your grudge is with me. stay away from my brothers and my sensei. understood. believe me, karai. um, leo, the robots have learned our moves. our crazy has become normal. i hate that. whoo. watch me now. flip, flip. bing, bing, zat. yeah. you see that. new high score, dudes. uh. leo, you want to play next. nah, go ahead, guys. i'm cool. it's good to have you back, leo. i mean it, brother. thanks, raph. i'm sorry to bother you, master splinter. i need to ask you some questions about karai. it is late, leonardo. these questions will have to wait for another time. she said you took her mother away from her. i know it's not true, right. no, it is not true, but the truth is almost as difficult. please, sensei. tell me. trust me. karai is my daughter. )
