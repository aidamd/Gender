yeah, um, i'm training chompy to be the ultimate warrior. cool. well, we want to "train" too.  please.  i'm chris bradford, my beard will defeat your horn every time, unicorn man.    chompy, what did we talk about. keep your flamefarts to yourself. gross dude, you ever think about how big chompy will get one day. his mom was like, huge.  yeah, but that will probably take, like, hundreds of space years or something. i feel bad about chompy's mom. me too. donnie said there's probably no way anything could survive a supernova. not even a giant cosmic monster like tokka.  but at least the little chompster has us for a family now. isn't that right, little guy. yeah.   sir, some kind of large ufo is making its way past neptune at approximately 70 million miles an hour. that's more than half the speed of light. well. is it the kraang or a triceraton battleship. neither, sir. long range scans indicate it's a giant, living organism. and the trajectory is earth.  teenage mutant ninja turtles

teenage mutant ninja turtles teenage mutant ninja turtles teenage mutant ninja turtles heroes in a half shell, turtle power  chris bradford granola bars. more macho in every bite. yo d, so how is april doing. i've been worried about her she's better, still resting. that crystal really messed her up. i'm worried there could be permanent damage. so, ya, think she lost most of her psychic powers, or what. her powers have been greatly reduced, but she's still far more powerful than she was before acquiring the crystal. it's hard to say until i test her again. turn the television to channel 6, right now.  that's right, folks, nasa and the earth protection force have reported that a giant alien turtle is flying through our solar system. its destination earth. i'd say pack your bags and head for the mountains, but who knows where this terrifying terrapin is going to make its horrifying home. the creature is coming for only one reason stay classy new york. chompy, your momma's alive and she's coming to find you.  yeah, and she could tear through the entire planet searching for him, even if she means well. well that's easy, we just give chompy back to her, and she leaves. what if tokka is so ticked off she destroys earth anyway. i mean, we put that turtlezilla through a lot, ya know what i'm sayin'. casey is right. i am. yes, you were due. i think this creature will not be pleased, even if we relinquish young chompy without a fight. and there will be a fight. even if tokka is peaceful, the militaries of the world are gonna try and stop her any way they can. that might mean allout kaiju war.  status report on the alien tortoise. and where is agent bishop. here, general griffen. that monster is only a few hours away. can't you ask your utrom pals to loan us some weapons. no, we have already allowed you access to our technology. earth must be able to stand on its own. however, it is imperative you do not attack the creature. what.. why..  she is one of the six great monsters of the known universe. attacking her will only enrage her. does it want to destroy us. tokka does not travel across multiple galaxies simply to destroy a world. she is coming here for a reason. and i intend to find out what that reason is.  i'm sorry, little guy. we have to take you back to your mom.  you belong with her. it's not that i don't care about you. i mean, i like you a lot. you're my little partner, but, you know, as a ninja sometimes you have to flow like water, sometimes you have to make your heart a stone. hey, um, raph, dude. sorry to interrupt. leo wants to talk plans.  so the question is, how can we return chompy to his mom before she gets to earth. if we could get our hands on a kraang stealth ship but the military seized them all. what about tcri, dude. i saw tons of soldiers going in there, they've totally taken over the entire building. and if there's one place we're good at breaking into, it's tcri  casey that's a great idea. it is. wow, casey had two good ideas in one day. it really is the end of the world. make haste my sons, but be wary. you are not dealing with kraang anymore, but dangerous human soldiers who are far more organized. and not semiidiotic.          that takes care of security.  mikey and casey, stay here, cover the hallway. we'll go for the hangar. i'll radio as soon as we hijack a stealth ship, ya got it. why do we gotta hang back. casey jones is a man of action. a vigilante on the front lines. a superhero bent on dude, they're like long gone already. what.. i bet ya they're worried we're gonna mess up the mission. nah, brah, they just want their dopest fighters on lookout. it's a hideous martian.  capture and contain. what. no way. for the record dudes, i'm a handsome mutant, not a hideous martian. deploy stun grenades.    great. would it kill these "scientists" to leave at least one stealth ship intact. which ship do we steal. oh yeah.  eenie meenie miney mo, catch a tiger claw by the toe that one. nice. real scientific.  i hope we picked the right one. i'm a little rusty. let's see, first i engage the gravequalizer.   missed it by that much. you think they noticed.   it's a possibility.     we gotta get to that other ship.   an alien infestation. destroy them. oh, that's right, destroy what you don't understand, real clever. sir, the martians have learned our language. great scott, they're adapting. wipe them out before they transform. wait. hold your fire. these are mutants, not aliens. some of the finest mutants this city has protecting it. bishop. whoa. what are the utrom doing here. i have become ambassador to earth, and am instructing the epf on alien matters, helping your planet advance their defenses. so, um, guess you know all about tokka. indeed. you visited tokka's home world of magdomar. do you have any idea why she would be coming here. umm maybe for this little guy.  what have you done. do you know the catastrophe you've brought upon this planet.. look, we thought chompy's mom was destroyed by a supernova, pal. that's why we brought him home with us. clearly you're too juvenile to be trusted. just give us a stealth ship so we can return him before she gets here. no. the epf and i will handle it. now, give me the vorkathian fire tortoise before i get angry. you are not touching him.    i'm telling you, this guy's no alien. he's a mutant, old dude. what is your relationship to this mutant. i'm his friend. and he's my sidekick  in my mission to cleanse the city of evil. hey casey, no offense, but you're more like our sidekick, dude. i'm getting nowhere with this kid. maybe we can learn something from the mutant alien.  um can we talk about this, scientist dudes.    you are in completely over your heads. tokka cannot be destroyed. let me take care of this. relinquish the baby.  keep an eye on chompy for me. raph. i'm teaching bishop some manners.    bishop, we don't have time for this. we have to return chompy to tokka now.  sir, we just got word. the president has ordered an attack squadron of vt9 fighters to intercept the alien monster. what.. this cannot be. this has greatly complicated matters.   i warned them. have they not listened to a single word the utrom have said. physical force will not stop tokka. bishop, listen to us. this is our fault. let us fix it. um, we do have more experience with a vorkathian fire turtle than anyone else on earth. you make a good point, donatello. it is imperative to appeal to tokka without confrontation. it may be earth's only chance. go quickly.  sir, general griffen considers these creatures hostile. we have orders to subdue. belay those orders, commander. i'm sorry, sir, we can't do that. get that baby back to its mother. i'll take care of the epf.       whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. wouldn't you rather use that to slice up some nice anchovy chocolate pizza.. i'll order.   phew.   aah.  who wants some. who's next.  let me go. get off of me. you've got grit kid, but that little stunt only delayed the examination.   we're free and clear. let's get out there and find tokka before  huh.  whoa.          tokka probably has no idea chompy is with us. how do you know for sure. probably the wall of fire she's breathing at us.. look out, donnie. she's all over us.  team 2, move out. formation delta.  has the area been evacuated. yes, sir. all clear. good. open fire.  prepare to fire.        i warned them not to engage her. order your units to fall back. give tokka some space. sorry sir, that's a negative. orders are from general griffen himself. fight to the finish.   i can restart the ship.  just give me a minute.  how do we even get near tokka with all that cannon fire. i'll handle the cannons. you guys get chompy back to tokka. let's do this. you ready, little guy.  general griffen. yes, bishop. have your men stand down or i'll take them down. troops, show no mercy.       hang on, chompy. just gotta get closer to your mom.  aah. aah.    tokka. it's chompy.  he's your baby. i was just trying to take care of him. i i didn't know holy chalupa. please don't eat us. please don't eat us.  we thought you were gone. i thought chompy was an orphan.   come on, raph. hurry. it's time to go back to your mom, chompy. i love you little guy. i couldn't say it before, but you know you're my little buddy.   goodbye, chompy picasso.     troops, stand ready.      really. you want chompy to stay here with me..  thank you, tokka. i swear, i'll take really good care of him.  chompy.   after this treachery the treaty with dimension x is over. the epf is meant to protect mankind from danger. not terrorize them. alien scum.  aah.  high three. both: huh. cowabunga.  oh. uhoh. hold on, raph. family reunion's over.   oh, boy.  let's get the heck outta here. yes. you did it, raph. awesome.   aww. ha. dadda raph. hey, good job, dadda raph. you stared down one big space monster, dude. don't call chompy's mom a space monster. hey, i'm just glad she's back in space. no doubt. one wrong sneeze and she could've wiped out all of humanity. raphael, have you thought about what will happen when chompy grows to full size. the earth may not be big enough to contain him. i think chompy is destined to go back to the stars one day. but it's gonna be a long time before that happens. right, little fella.  ow.  )
