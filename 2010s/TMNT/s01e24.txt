'cause last night, i dreamt donnie and me were rodeo detectives, and there w can it, mikey. i'm serious. okay. but you'll never find out who stole the buckaroo diamond. you through. yeah. it was the clown.  donnie.. guys, i think i know where donnie went. where.  oh, there. that's the secret message. obviously, he followed it. after he figured out what it was. what would donnie do. what would donnie do. gimme that thing.  or what would donnie do if he was doing an impression of raph. kirby's voice: april, it's dad. i pray you get this message. i've been moved to a secret kraang facility. april: dad.  huh. doesn't seem very kraangy.   it is one of the ones called the turtles. looks like you could use a tuneup, huh. yeah. right. am i right. who's the hero now. holy cow.  no response necessary.  why would donnie try to rescue april's dad by himself. uh, maybe because i told him he has no shot with april. what. why would you say that. because he has no shot with april. well, yeah but you don't tell him that. the heart's a soft muscle, man. a soft muscle. squish.  ooh. wah.  whoa, whoa.  noooo. april, today, i will train your mind. close your eyes. listen to the silence. hmm. i know what you are thinking, april, but it is best for you to remain here. sensei, that message was from my father. i should be up there. the best way to be reunited with your father is to wait here. now, again, close your eyes and listen for my movement. listen for the silence.  how can i listen for the silence. you weren't listening. listen deeply. again.  okay. listen deeply.  well, i heard you that time. heard what. i did not move. then what's that sound. you hear that, right. it it's coming from it's coming from down there.  let's follow it. i hear nothing. really. hmm.  most curious, april, that you are hearing something i cannot. well done. april. april.      it's for me.  yah. and that's for you. mr. o'neil.     that which is the criminal has escaped. he wishes to retrieve the weapons which are of his.    are you sure this is the right place. either donnie's here, or the garage mechanic stole his lock pick. so the mechanic could break into his own place. come on, leo, think this stuff through, dude. let's move.  uh, you knew that. hmm. all right. you say it. let's move. yeah. unh. punk.  hello. mr. o'neil. it's me. donatello. the turtle which is the one who has gained entry has found the captive. exactly as kraang had planned the plan. yes, the plan is going according to plan. thank goodness you've come. right. um shall we go. immediately. i thought that you might be able to decipher my message. well, it wasn't so bad. you used a basic dvb scramble algorithm, so i just both: flopped the ecm datastream. donatello why are all the other cells open. i must have opened them when i let you out but they were all empty.  i'm not so sure about that. okay, don't worry. whatever this is, i'm sure i can handle   on second thought, sir, you might want to worry just a little.  what is that thing. you must've accidentally released one of the kraang's alien experiments. it looks like some family of salamandridae, if i'm not mistaken. with that proboscis. it's clearly a pleurodelinae a newt.  "newtralizer" is more like it. by the way, prefer if you don't tell mikey i named something without him. he's kind of protective about that. pretty sure donnie took this guy out. how can you tell. he looks bored to death.  hey, guys. check out my ride. whoo. wah.   nice, mikey. oh, yeah.  do not say "i meant to do that. " let's move.  huh.  he must've gone through this door.   again, what would donnie have done. hmm. oh. i got it.   boy, donnie's idea was terrible. why is that which is called alarm sounding that which is called the alarm. something which is not the plan is occurring. we got company.     other way. ahh.  okay. maybe the solo mission wasn't such a good idea.  come on. ahh. phew. you are aware this is a detention facility. huh. you just locked us in a cell. a affirmative. um i think i can get us out. aaahhhh. eventually. unh.  listen to the silence. listen deeply.  that way.  the kraang communication device kraang searches for is activated in this vicinity. kraang is that which they call idiotic.  phew.  i don't like the sound of that. maybe if we ignore it it'll go away. someone's not ignoring it.  move. okay, if i jump the resistors   the door should open. donnie. mr. o'neil. big, beadyeyed, lizardy thing with weapons.  donatello calls it the neutralizer. you named something without me. ahh. look out. whoa.  you named something without me.  we gotta get out of this prison. technically, this is a detention center. the difference being that not now, donnie. oh sorry, mr. o'neil. great. now there's two of them.  little help. how about some big help. not really the time to check your email. i'm guessing if they had the newtralizer locked up, it wasn't because he was their friend.  apparently, he likes trashing kraang. who doesn't.  all: yeah. all: no.  we've gotta access the control panel. got it. raph i got it. oh, really. really.   ow. ah. close one, huh.  let's split up. donnie, you get mr. o'neil out of here.  no.  huh. wah. phbbt.  hyah.   booyakasha. both: mikey. don't worry. i wore my seatbelt.  come on.  hmm. interesting. but i'm curious how you hear the sound but i do not. maybe it's why the kraang are after me. april. dad. dad. oh, dad, i can't believe it. you guys saved my dad. thank you so much. the guy you really should be thanking is donnie. well, i seriously. you should've seen him. he was   raph, i think that's a little we kept saying, "careful, donnie, it's too dangerous. " and donnie was like, "danger. ha. nothing'll stop me. " thank you. thank you, raphael.  those weren't my exact words, but ah, thank you, donnie.  eh. well, i tried. dude, i'd say you succeeded.  the plan which has been set into motion has taken the motion in which the plan has been set. that alien creature of yours nearly thwarted our objective. kraang did not expect the turtle known as donatello to release him. fortunately for kraang, this error did not prevent the planned escape of the human who is called kirby o'neil. the turtles have undoubtedly brought o'neil back to their lair. soon, vengeance will be ours.  it's good to have you back. it's good to be back. )
