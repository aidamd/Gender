hands. would you like to know its secrets. together with me. rin. pyo. toh. sha.  rin. pyo. toh.  i thought a night out would be good for me. but i still can't shake everything that's happened. at least dad's back. i just want a little normalcy in my life. ha.  casey. the six deadly poisons was cool, but i would have smashed that scorpion dude in one hit.  and then yesterday, my head fell off my neck. and now i can't find my head, so i have to walk around with no head.  not listening to a single word.  you wanna know what my favorite part of the movie was. i don't know, casey. the nonstop violence. it was the way the hero never gave up. even against all odds. good luck finding your missing head. i'm sure it'll turn up.   hello. where am i.  who's there. show yourself. aah.     aah.    it was just a nightmare. what.    april.     help. turtles. kirby. snakebite. please. help me. guys, quick. give her some space.  she's gonna be okay, right, donnie. oh no.  and forever casey jones  whoa. what the what. footbots.   better warn the guys.  what.       goongalaaaaa.    aw, yeah, you better robocheck yourselves before you wreck yourselves, sons.   casey jones  ugh.   huh. karai right. we never really met. i like what i'm seeing though. you got a sweet style. oh. do you like this.  i thought you were one of the good guys. i don't wanna hurt you. but i want to hurt you. slowly. painfully.  oh. i'm not sure if i want to fight you or ask you out. not bad, jones. i got more surprises for ya, sweetheart. so do i.   it's over, karai. it's not over until i say it is. aah.    mm. whoa, that was crazy. i mean, don't get me wrong, it was nice and all. but why are my lips numb.  the numbness is one of the effects of my venom. some go faster than others. first: weakness.  then, paralysis.  then, blackout.  you're the second. now i'm going to poison the turtles. onebyone.  her condition's getting worse. the poison's not showing any signs of stopping. bitten by a poisonous snake in her bedroom. doesn't make any sense. guys, we got an s. o. s. from casey's bike. i'm gonna check it out. take mikey with you. why. because you might need backup, and i'm busy helping donnie. fine. but no turflytle. mikey and raph: the new ateam. let's do this, boy.   maybe i should have taken her to a hospital. no, no, you did the right thing, kirby. uhh. what is it, donnie. none of the antivenoms are working.  if i can't come up with an antidote soon  this is the place casey's bike was sending out the signal. maybe we should split up.  dude, listen. you hear that.   casey. what happened. a. . a. . attack foot kiss he's not making any sense. i think he's asking you to kiss his foot. you better do what he says. make yourself useful and grab his legs.   hopefully donnie will know what to do. oh, no. oh, no, oh, no, oh, no. i think he's been bit. you're gonna have to suck the poison out, brah. i'm not sucking the poison out. i'm driving. you suck it. but i think the bite's on his butt. that's gross, dude. you do it.  just do it already.    now what.     any luck, donatello. anything. sensei, what are you doing. you should still be resting. not when april is in danger. not when i have this. an ancient poisondraining mantra.  raph. where are you guys. raph.  hello, leonardo. your brothers are right here with me. karai. is that you. though they don't appear to be in the best of health. i'm afraid that if you and donatello don't come soon, then raphael, michelangelo, and casey jones will all expire.  come to the old abandoned greenwich street station. and bring donatello with you. i'll be waiting. karai. karai.  she's not getting any better. i brought her here because i thought you could save her. calm down, you two. we have another problem. there is no other problem. april is the only thing you two should be worried about. i'm doing my best, mr. o'neil.  silence. all of you. if i can focus, i may be able to get the poison out of her system.  kirby, stay here. help master splinter with whatever he needs. come on, donnie. you're with me.   mu. ryo. ju. son. mu. ryo ju. son. mu. ryo. ju. son. e. sai. nyu. rai.     april. no. mu.

this is the way. ugh. ii don't feel so good. me neither.   leonardo and donatello. sneaky, coming from the sewers. how are you feeling, turtles. nauseous. dizzy. my brain is melting. dude why do you have a pineapple for a head. we've been poisoned. oh, we have to act fast.   my venom is highly toxic in any form. even in water. it seeps through the skin in seconds.   it's over, leo.  you and your friends are finished. finally, after all this time. put them with the others. i want to admire my trophies.  rin pyo toh sha the poison is slow. within the hour you will all perish.  i don't even care about any of you. you're nothing more than a means to get to splinter. rin. pyo. toh. sha. the rat will eventually come for you, and then i will have my revenge.   beating the poison impressive. shredder used some kinda brain worm on you. lies won't help you, leo. i'll just have to finish you myself.     karai, you have to fight it. ya.      april, the poison is still inside you. i can slow it down, but only you can defeat it. what was i thinking. i'm calling the hospital. no. this venom has no cure. only the mantras can save her now.   whoa. oh.  still feeling the effects.  you're weak, leo. and you're done for.  rin. pyo.  toh. sha. mu. ryo. ju. son. kai, jin, retsu, zai, zen. e, zai, nyu, rai, kak. rin. pyo. mu. ryo. toh. sha. ju. son. rin. mu. pyo. ryo. toh. son.  kai. jin. retsu. zai. zen. what are you doing. what is this.  aah.  rin. ugh. ya. pyo. ya. toh. sha.    mm. april. you did it, splinter. oh, thank you. oh, my sweet baby girl.  you're coming with us, karai. oh, karai  rin. pyo. toh.   man snakebite is worse than the worst. snakebite's not that bad. i've been bit by giant wasps, mutant dogs, dream beavers, squirrels, squirrelanoids are you still talking. it wasn't really snakes that almost took us out. it was karai. she's back under shredder's control. he's the one responsible not karai. you should be enjoying your victory. you did a great thing tonight, leonardo. you saved everyone. not everyone. i tried to get karai out of shredder's control. i failed, sensei. i'm sorry. we saved her once, leonardo. perhaps we can save her again. and now you show great gifts as a healer. being at the edge of your life gave you a power that few martial artists can tap. i am proud of you, my son.  um, leo. we just wanted to thank you for saving us. yeah. you kicked footbot butt, stopped the poison, got us out of there. and you did it solo. none of us could've done that. maybe you're right. maybe tonight was a win. )
