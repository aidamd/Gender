"oh, sister, when you were..." i'm gonna stop you right there.  your butt looks fantastic in that skirt.  argh.  i have no idea how starfire could still love you after all you put her through.  she loves me.  probably the only person in the universe who does.  wait.  i wanna be a better sister.   sister fun time.   looks good.  i'm so glad you like it.  uh, you think you could give me a makeover.  i hate my look.  i hear somebody who's not happy with himself.  but who should be, because he is great.  aww. thanks.  so robin...  please, call me mr. butt, you've earned it.  i wish you

know.  raven.  who's the toughest man person you know.  you're the toughest man person i know.  booyah.  and do you think i started out that way.  nope.  i used to be an average normal looking joe, minding my own business when suddenly...  ahhh.  fire. brimstone.  why.  my body got all messed up in some crazy accident.  then my papa hooked me up with these awesome robot parts and that's what makes me tough.  the scars man.  the scars.  for reals.  yes, for the reals, beast boy.  hey, what's up with that ostrich.  why's he so manly, huh.  oh, it's just the rad scar on his face.  uhoh. i

beast boy, look out.  ahhh.   bandages. we need more bandages.  don't worry. i got you, beastie.  you're lucky your animal super powers are keeping your arm alive.  so gross.  while we figure out how to reattach it this should help you.  hey, it's gonna be okay, beast boy.  i know.  don't let this bum you out.  it won't.  are you not upset with the loss of your appendage.  nope, now i have this sweet robot arm to go with my manly scar.   okay that is the coolest thing i've ever seen. amazing.  so hot.  what was that, ray ray.  nothing.   robot arms are tough and all but losing body parts is not a good thing.  worked out for you.  maybe cyborg's right.  we'll work to reattach...   ah, ow.  beast boy, you are not laughing.  beast boy might have thought that was funny.  but i'm a man now. scar man.   whoa.   uh.  argh.  what is it with beast boy getting his arm blown off on purpose.  you mean scar man.  his name is beast boy.   that is no boy.  i was just trying to cheer him up by telling him scars were cool, but now he has taken it too far.  beast boy: hey, my man, keep these on ice for me. thanks.  what's in here.  oh, you know, just some lame body parts i'm not using anymore.  ahhh.  what did you do, beast boy.  just made myself a little tougher.  and it's scar man.    you can say that again.  scar man.  whoa.  you do not get it.  oh, i get it.  i used to have a little kid arm, and a little kid leg, and now i'm bigger and manlier than ever.  this is not an improvement.  did you say something.  couldn't hear you over my manliness.  darn. darn.  we gotta get those body parts back.  ahhh.  uh.      good news bro.  i figured out how to reattach all your body parts.  can't hear you.  it's a simple procedure and you'll be back to your old self.  i prefer to remain awesome, thanks.  one sec. blast power.  excuse me, i'm taking this party sky high.  woman's voice: sky high.  there has to be a way to make him realize what he's done to his body is terrible.   hey, beast boy, look at me.  look at how tough i've made myself.  ooh.  crab claws. clickety clickety click.  so tough.  and check out these horse haunches.   manly enough for you.  what'd you do to yourself, cyborg.  i'm teaching you a lesson.  that cutting off body parts and replacing them with other parts just ain't cool.   whatevs.  taking care of yourself is more important than looking tough, man.  uhhuh, sure. you done yet.  yeah, i'm done.  uh, i'm sorry. maybe you're right, bro.  i guess i got kinda carried away in my pursuit of toughness.  i think we both got a little carried away.   you do look pretty tough though dude.  this looks tough.  you just upped your man factor five times.   hey, what else can we do to up our man factors.  only one way to find out.         beasty
