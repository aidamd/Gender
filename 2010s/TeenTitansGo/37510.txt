 it just mod. i saw it move.  everyone stand back.  this is a level nine biohazard.  i assure you, parry is perfectly harmless.  if we don't act now, starfire, this whole thing is going to spiral out of control, and we'll end up on the other side of the galaxy fighting a giant spider alien.  or something.   parry says you are being quite rude, robin.  uh, don't think parry can say anything...  we are communicating through my brain.  uh, star. this is not normal.  not normal.  it seems that is something i am often accused of being by my fellow titans.  she is out of her mind, silkie.   out of her mind.  i mean, she's talking to a parasite. a parasite.   crazy.  oh, come on. don't tell me you buy her story.  here. let me show you something.   no one must know about that.  according to my research, parry has no ability to communicate with its host.  and is most definitely not friendly.  i think star was so sad that no one wanted to celebrate feast day that she created a personality for this disgusting mass as a coping mechanism.  we better tell the others.  guys. guys. we have to talk.  it's about... hey. hey.  hold up, robin.  parry was just finishing up a story.  go on, parry.    what does throboozepussglowglow mean, star.  hopefully i can relay it correctly.  and then she was all like, "i have no idea where the eggs are."  oh. eggs. love it.  uh, did i miss something or did you all just become best buds with an open sore.  as you can see, robin, you have misjudged parry.  yeah, robin, he's great. even raven likes him.  whatever, he's fine.   i am sorry, parry. but i already asked them and they declined.  wait. what'd he say. what'd he say.  he asked if you all would join us for feast day.  i told him... all: i'm in.  what about you, robin.  oh, i'll be there.  to keep an eye on that filthy parasite.  wonderful.  now, i promised to show parry around the city.  we will be back in time for tonight's feast.  i don't like this, titans. i better follow them to make sure nothing happens.  oh, i wish my tapeworm was more like parry.  i followed them all day.  just waiting for that thing to mutate into the giant spider we'll end up fighting on the other side of the galaxy, but no dice.  he's a more fiendish opponent than i thought.  or, parry's just a friendly parasite.  and you're a creepy guy in the bushes with a camera.  hmm. creepy camera guy.  no.  i am certain this will be the best feast day ever.   parry would like to make a toast.   he says he would like to thank you for welcoming him into your home.  uh, i'd like to make a toast, too.  we've gotta separate that thing from you before it kills you.  take it easy.  parry doesn't exist.  don't you see. he's a figment of starfire's imagination.  it has got to go.  he is never leaving, robin. we are the best friends.  well, if parasites are so great, then everyone should have one.  good thing i brought some for the occasion.   uh, what are you doing.  apparently, i'm making friends.   this is so great.  yeah.  i love sharing my nutrients.  ah, i love how weak they make me feel.  ugh. why didn't i get a parasite years ago.  stop it. just stop.  parry is the only thing that makes me feel normal.  nice going, dude.   someone call a doctor.  don't worry, star. this won't hurt a bit.    robin. what are you doing to parry.  it's for your own good.   hey, robin. you can talk.  yep. i communicate through brainwaves, just like starfire said.  who feels like a jerk now.  guess i should have made an effort to understand you.  it's not me you need to do a better job of understanding.  oh, starfire.  wow, you really are the greatest.  here, to show you there's no hard feelings i made you a cape.  but we're inside my brain.  it's a cape for your brain, dumdum.  oh. cool.  you talked to him.  sorry, starfire. your traditions may be strange, but...  sometimes i guess i'm not the normal one.  more than sometimes, robin.   what's wrong, parry.  do you have to leave.   goodbye, parry.   don't leave, man. i'm gonna miss you so much.  this is awkward... i'll always cherish my brain cape.   i love you.    ha. yes. what did i say.  i knew it. i knew it. i knew it all along.  you fools just wouldn't listen, i was right and you were wrong.  sad isn't it.  how some places treat their bacon.  cook it in another zip code and reheat it on this hypnotizing carousel of shame.  time for a wake up call.  time for wendy's baconator.  piled high with onlyfreshly cooked bacon.  does this look likemicrowaved bacon. please.  this is where six strips ofapplewoodsmoked goodness meets half a poundof pure, fresh beef.  don't keep thebaconator waiting.  yeah.  only a couple more hourstill the biggest, craziest, booyahiestparty of the year.  the titans eastannual dance party.  i can't wait.yep. looking forward to it.  okay, guys, let's bring it in.  tonight is our time to shine.  we have been working all year for this.  so, i've only got one thing to say.  titans. break it down.    we are undeniable.  so, what time does this party start anyway.  i bet it says on the invite.  invite. i never got an invite.  hey. me neither.  come to think of it... wait a second.   robin: i just wanna dance.  we're disgusting people.  why wouldn't they invite us.  last year we were the life of the party.   ah, yeah.  robin: it's on, players.        yep. life of the party.   oh, you must be starving, my little bumgorf.  do not worry, lunch is here.  hey, starfire.  got some bad news.  none of us were invited to the titans east party.  can you believe that.  no, in fact, i cannot. for i have been invited.  what. you got an invite.  guess you were the only one who got invited.  i see. in that case i shall inform the others that i am more wellliked than they are.  don't do that. you'll hurt their feelings.  don't even tell them you were invited.  but, if i do not tell them the truth, what other option is there.  um, it's called lying.  you know, saying something that's not true.  just lie about where you're going tonight.  but, is lying not wrong.  not if you wink it's not.  a wink is like saying, "just kidding, pal." you know so much about the lying.  i'll teach you everything.  and in exchange you can take me to the party as your guest.  it is a deal.  the best way to learn how to lie is by starting off small.  go ahead.  hello, cyborg.  it is currently 76 degrees outside.  uh, okay.  actually, it is only 74 degrees.     okay, star. you're ready.  titans.  i have something to tell you that is true.  tonight, beast boy and i will not be at the tower because we are going to...  the movies.  cool. we'll come with.  yeah. we got nothing better to do now that we're not going to the party.  sounds good.  wonderful.   ah, looks like we just lied ourselves into a corner.  and there is only one way out of the lie corner.  more lies.  oh, hey, star. which movie are we gonna go see tonight.  regarding the movies, raven would prefer you not to come with us.  what. why.  she said you chew your popped corn too loudly.  oh, she did, did she.  raven. what.  so i chew too loudly, do i.  i never said that.  well, starfire said you did, and starfire never lies.  you know what. just forget it. i'm not going to the movies.  you told him i said he chews too loudly.  of course i did not.  also, robin wants you to stay home tonight, to clean out the gunk in the freezer.  he thinks you are the slob.     raven: azarath metrion zinthos.  whoa. why did you do that.  oh, you know why.  and i won't be going to the movies tonight.  okay, you need to stop lying.  but why. it is working.  but we're just making everyone mad at each other.  i understand.  i promise i will stop the lying.  thank you.  now, if you'll excuse me, my head is engulfed in flames and i must extinguish it.        hey. really looking forward to the movie.  actually, robin, i believe you should reconsider going.  what do you mean.  cyborg thinks you have an unpleasant smell.  he does not wish to sit next to you.  unpleasant smell.  maybe i won't go, then.  i'd hate to inflame his precious nostrils.  we did it. no one wants to go to the movies.  we are free to go to the party in secret.  hurray.  yeah. hurray.    i'm sorry, am i bothering you.   ahem. question, cy.  does this smell funny to you.   uhoh, look what a slob i am.  oh, man, my nose touched garbage.  you've got some nerve.  now i really smell.   we have two options.  we can go to the biggest party of the year.  or we can stay here and set everything straight.   yeah. you think everything's okay back at the tower.  i am sure they are solving their problems like any rational human adolescent.  come out, come out, wherever you are.   raven: hey, chrome dome.  chew on this.  oh, no. our beloved tower.  our friends. the silkie.     everyone, stop.   this has gone too far.  raven never said you chew too loudly.  robin never said you had to clean the freezer.  and cyborg never said you smelled.  i don't understand.  i lied.  i was invited to the titans east party.  i did not want to tell you the truth, because i thought it might hurt your feelings.  instead i caused even more pain.  seriously.  i am ashamed.  i got so caught up in the lying, i turned my friends against each other and forgot to care for my precious little bumgorf.  i do not deserve to be called a teen titan.  which is why i must quit the team.  i will miss all of you.  star. star, star.  it's okay. we forgive you.  you do. yeah.  you're being harder on yourself than we could ever be.  come on, let's clean this place up.  i'm such a slob.  wow, star. that was a really heartfelt apology.  and i meant every single word of it.  wait. did you just wink.  no. that was a blink.  beast boy: you just did it again.  starfire: i have something in my eye.   beast boy: i can't tell if you're lying or not.  starfire: it must be the season of allergies.  go...  whoa  you can go bananas...  with a talking toy from the new movie "minions" rated pg.  and the goodness of new gogurt strawberrybanana yogurt.  the newest flavor in yourmcdonald's happy meal.   meatball party.  who wants meatballs.i want meatballs.  then you get meatballs.  i want meatballs.  but i'm a vegetarian.  then you get tofu meatballs.  ooh. what are the meatballs.  you're about to find out.  keep it down. i'm trying to read.  coming at you, girl.meatball party.  do you know what time it is.  all: mystery meatball time.  ah, who's gonna get it.  and the mystery meatball goes to  raven.  why do you always have to force everyone to do what you think is fun.  because everybody loves meatballs.  eat, eat, eat the meatball. eat, eat, eat the meatball.  eh...  shh...  eat the meatball. )
