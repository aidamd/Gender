cloak.  awesome. thanks. let's see if it fits.  mmm.  fresh.  look at me, i'm raven.   darkness... death... skulls and bones...   don't say anything if i can use your spell book to turn the couch into a burrito.  hmm.  awesome.    oops. i got this.    almost had it.   don't say anything if...  i'm not talking 'cause that stupid meatball cracked my tooth.   ah.    ow.  uh... er... raven.  you, uh, said something about a cracked tooth.  and this crack is like a portal from which terrible things escape every time you open your mouth.  i'm guessing this has something to do with you being part demon.  you have an octopus living in your mouth.  are you that...   robin: close your mouth. close your mouth.  ah.  we have to get you to a dentist. no way.  i hate dentists. ow.  oh...  argh.  ow.  ugh.  why does it keep going for me.   oh.  sorry, rave. we draw the line at devouring teammates.  we're taking you to the dentist.   whoa, guys.  if they seal that tooth, beast boy will be stuck in there forever.  well, nothing we can do about it now.  i believe there is still time to stop...   can't you see i'm reading an important periodical.  found the pork chop hiding in the tree.  now, where are you, you tricky spool of thread.  dentist: open wide.   you know, goofus reminds me of beast boy so much.  too bad we'll never see him again.  argh.  so, we all good now. what do you think.  no.  we have lost half our team and raven still cannot open her mouth.  what are we going to do.  there's only one thing we can do.  meatball party. who wants meatballs.  perhaps, there is a better option.  yes.  perhaps.  argh.  can't you see this is all your fault, cyborg...   ah.  clearly, that was your fault.  you're going to communicate by drawing pictures.   i love this game.  forest... angel... no good.  is that a clock or time. hmm...  i always force you to have a good time.  booyah. i am so good.  but i thought that was our thing.  you pretend to hate having fun and i force you to have it.  sometimes you just want to do your own thing.  genius. how did i put that together with just a drawing of a snake and an upside down happy face, i have no idea.  i didn't realize i made you feel this way.  when i act this way, you find me super, super irritating.  oh, yeah. i'm on a roll.  don't you worry, raven, i'm gonna make this right.  open wide.  ah...    uh... ah.    tentacle, whack. another tentacle. whack.  poke, poke.  oh.   there's no way out, bro.  we've tried everything.  quit it. we're all gonna die.  the only way out is to seal that crack.  and i got just the thing to do it.     argh.  gah. my mouth tastes like meatballs.  i know. we're all super jealous.  look, raven, i'm sorry.  just 'cause i enjoy something doesn't mean i need to force it on everyone else.  i

magic eraser titans, i've assembled you all here for a staff meeting.  staff meeting. staff meeting. staff meeting.  staff meeting.  what was that for.  i've been going over the performance reviews and vigilance is down 4%.justice, 5%.  yet, somehow, horseplay is up 95%.   what.  now, if you guys were just more like my staff here...  ugh... here we go again.  what. you treating that staff like it's a person.  they got a great tuna melt there, too...  uh, i'm sorry, what, cyborg.  i missed that. we were discussing lunch plans.  yeah. it's super weird, robin.  oh, yeah. well, we thinkyou're super weird.  so, ha.  on tamaran, many people communicate with lumps of wood.  thank you, starfire.  those people are banished from our city and fed to the dorpnug.  you do knowit's just a stick, right.  uhoh. he hates being called that.  a stick.  you better stop calling him that.  well, that's what it is. mr. sticky stickerton.  a stick, stick, stickitty stick.   whoa, whoa. calm down, buddy. trust me, they're not worth it.  look into my eyes. go to your happy place.    stick.  i warned you.  what you call a stick... ow.  ...is the most refined fighting instrument on the planet.  perfectly balanced. ooh... ooh... ow.   multipurpose.  and the best friend a guy could ask for.  but i thought i was your best friend.  no. oh. ow.  bottom line, this staff is the best sidekick any hero could ever have.  oh, what's that.  oh, yeah, burger sounds great, buddy.  they got that cool kaiser bun that... you driving.    uh, anyone seen the plunger.  why not use robin's staff.  yeah, he seems to think it can do any job.     wow, this stick is awesome.    i love this stick.   whoa, whoa, whoa, dudes, i got a solution.   there.  ooh... i think you broke it.  aw, snap. literally.  robin will be greatly upset.  then no one better tell him.  maybe i can put this together with a little magic.      morning, guys. anybody seen my staff.  uhuh.  nope.  sorry.  we broke it.  what.  yeah, your stick got broke.  but, we taped it together.  good as new. here you go, bro.  yeah, i can still use this.  sure you can, bud.  i have a feeling everything's gonna be aok.  aok, yeah.    everything is not aok.    it's not fair. it worked so well before.     argh.   sad punch... sad punch.  frowny kick.     oh, how i hate when robin glorbnaks with the sadness.  yeah, bro needs a new stick.  but you heard him, that staff was irreplaceable.  if a spell won't work, there is one place he could get a new one.   robin...   what.  ugh... i know a place where you can find a new staff.  one that's even better than the last one.  there can never be another staff. never.   never.   look, i don't want a new staff.  what if it was magic.  i like magic.  then you have to journey to the ancient universe tree.  the tree that will heal your pain and give you a new staff.  the universe tree.  how do i find it. make no mistake.  the quest is long and dangerous.  you will have to scale the mountain of doubt, pass over the infinite cha, and only when you see the falcon of truth will you be halfway there.  and finally, you will arrive at the universe tree.  is there somewhere i can drive to instead.  no.    whoa... this must be the universe tree.   ah...  i am, indeed. i have been waiting for you, robin.  you can talk.  of course i can talk. i am the magic tree of elderioth.  in fact, i speak many languages, some only known to demons and fairyfolk.  i've come to find a new staff.  it would appear you have already found one.   this. you see, robin, your journey was not about finding...  yeah, this is a root. i ripped it out of the side of a filthy mountain.  it's got bird dookie on it.  wait. don't do...  i want a magic staff.  i'm afraid you do not understand.  the staff is merely... ow. ow.  hey. what are you doing there.   came here for a staff, gonna get a staff.  you're missing the point. ow... ow. ow.  okay, that's starting to hurt.    please, if you stop now i may yet survive.   timber.   not bad.   how could you cut me down. i have been here providing wisdom to travelers since the beginning of time.   sounds boring. a little bit, yes.  well, now you're going to get to see the world and hit people in the face.  that could be a nice change of pace.  you know, my other staff talked, but never really out loud.  it was only kind of in my head. this might actually work out.  both: we are the magical tree custodians, guardians of the forest.  prepare to be punished.  knee smack.  custodian poke. custodian poke.  ear bite.  huh... my old staff didn't bite.  do i look like your old staff.  i've assembled you all here for a staff meeting.  staff meeting. staff meeting. cyborg and raven: ow.  staff meeting. staff meeting. beast boy and starfire: ow.  beast boy: ouch...  check it out. i have a new staff, even better than the one before.   it appears you are in much better spirits.  thanks to raven. this guy is great.  then i guess you don't want your old one back.  my staff. oh...   you're alive.  yeah, what's that.  oh, yeah, buddy. i missed you too.  i finally figured out a spell to put it back together.  we've got a lot of catching up to do. what.  oh, yeah, a movie sounds great.  what are you going to do with me.  oh, i know exactly what to do with you.  for 3,000 lives of men, i have bestowed wisdom and knowledge.  i was not made for this.  man, you talk too much.   .  .  .    haahaaaaaaa.  it's time to join the action and soak up the fun.  with a nerf or nerfrebelle brand toy and the goodness ofgogurt strawberry yogurt in

isn't an unidentified female intruder.  this is terra.  and you can identify her as my girlfriend.   "girlfriend" isn't the word i'd use.   we prefer "soul mate" huh.  how did she get in without setting off the alarm.  i gave her the tower security codes.  aw. trading security codes already.  this sounds serious.  oh, please be regale us with your tale of love at first visual contact.  okay, it's a pretty typical story, though.  boy meets girl.  girl asks if boywill get her access to the titans tower.  boy falls for girl.  girl insists on gettinga schematic of the titans' defense capabilities.   i told myself i wouldn't cry.  so what's an attractive,  decent smelling girl doing with beast boy.  i guess i like how trusting he is.  i mean he is really, really trusting.  you know, she has superpowers, too.  so, if this works out, which it will, she'll make a great addition to the team.  a new titan.  let's see what you've got.     rock manipulations. sweet.  i like what i see.  but if terra wants to be a part of the team, she'll have to pass a series of carefully designed tests.  be prepared.  for anything.   oh.  come on, sugar, i'll show you around the rest of the tower.  no touching, remember.   titan test.  yeah.     well played, terra.   but that's only the...  ...first test.  there is something i don't like about her.  i think i know what you don't like.  that she's all up in your man's grill.  and you're all, "uhuh, boo bear is mine." what.  we watch a lot of daytime talk shows together.  i have something special to show you.  you know how you're telling me how you love secret compartments.  it's my favorite thing in the world.  well...    )
