  titans.  okay, titans. to take down dr. light, i'm going to need your best.  your best oneliners. titans go.   it's lights out for you, dr. light.    light's about to have hispunched out.   the dr. light shall need a doctor when i am through with him.   great job, raven, but where's the oneliner.  this is stupid. how's that.  eh. really should have the word "light" or "doctor" in it.  now that dr. light is back in prison and the museum is destroyed, i wonder what we should do with this.  well, if i were you, i probably wouldn't be messing with it.  easy there, raven.  yeah. what's got you all worked up.  i'm not worked up.  oh, well, sorry.  it's hard to tell how you really feel with your delivery sometimes.  but you should really stop passing that thing around like a ball.  you need to calm down.  you are out of control.  oh, yeah. you're not mad.  you are at least excited about the buttkicking of the dr. light, yes.   was that excitement or your trademark use of the sarcasm.  uh, guys, i think this thing just turned on, or something. you take it.  i don't want it. uhuh.  whee. i love this game.  uhoh.   oh, no.  we just split raven into four versions of herself.  actually, there are five ravens now.  are you sure. because...  go ahead, beast boy. we'll wait.  zero, one, two...   you don't start at zero when you count.  really. huh. then five it is.  oh, no.  we just split raven into five versions of herself.  you okay, raven...s.  i told you not to mess around with that thing.  ow.  free. free. i'm free.  i don't like it here.  what's not to like.    seems the prism has divided raven into the five core parts of her personality.  purple is her passion. cyborg: red is her rage.  starfire: pink, her happiness.  beast boy: orange, her laziness.  robin: and gray is her timidity.  well, at least now we know what the ravens are thinking.  this is going to be awesome. just think.  five ravens in battle.  ah, maybe having five different ravens around won't be such a bad thing after all. ow.  time to watch everybody's favorite action movie.  ow.  it's not everybody's favorite movie. just yours, jerk.  now the old raven would have just said, "whatever," but you, you say what's on your mind.  i love it.  oh, and i hate it that you scream all the time.  ow. good to know.  well, everyone likes horror movies, right.  just thinking about them gives me a nervous stomach.   oh, no.  message delivered.  you're not going to have to tell me twice.  perhaps a comedy.  comedies make me laugh.  ow. what was that for.  because i love comedies.  this might be the fastest we've ever come to a consensus.  i'm really liking these different ravens.  ow.   nothing's better than pancakes in the morning.   how about this.   i see a giraffe.  is that a llama doing the tango.  can't a person get a decent nondancing breakfast around here.  hey, gang, what's for brea...     titans, go.   ravens, go.  as great as finally knowing how the ravens actually feel is, they're really messing up our battle game.  since the prism split them up, we should be able to use the crystals to trap the ravens and put them back together.  oh. do we have to.  i kind of like this one.  should we be discussing our plan in front of her.  don't worry about me. i don't really care.   but i do.  ow. ow.  you're not going to use that on us.  i don't want to be combined with these losers.  that looks too scary to me.  i'll go if you come with.  i'm good with whatever.  let's get out of here.  robin: looks like they're spreading through the city.  we're going to have to split up to capture all the ravens.  i'm going after purple. no.  oh, come on, please. no.  then beast boy and i will take the most dangerous one.  pink.  oh, yeah, pink.  we may not come back alive.  isn't she the happy one.  when she makes those marshmallow clouds, the cholesterol alone could kill you.  not looking forward to this.  both: see you.   ah. i guess we'll go after the rest.  titans, go.  just go away.   there she is.  gumballs. wink.  yay.  hug.  aww.  both: pink. huh.  both: we missed you.  i missed you, too.  let's have fun.  oh, my gosh. yes.     all: whoa.   bees: go, go, go.  i hope this never ends.  what are you going to do.  the only thing i can do.   robin, be careful.       beast boy. this hamburger is fantastic.  i know, dude. i know.   whoo.  shiny.  both: no.   we've captured all the ravens except for orange.  and we've already searched the whole city for her.  oh, hey.  she has been here the whole time.  and she ate everything in the fridge. how could you.  let's get our raven back.  thanks for making me whole again.  uh, you're being mean, aren't you.  no, really. thanks.  i believe this is the sarcasm.  not being sarcastic at all.  oh, the confusion.  i can't tell what she's trying to say.  just great job, guys.  make it stop. make it stop.  who knew that under that dark cape and darker scowl that a mix of happy, scared, loving, angry, lazy emotions exist.  as much as we love your mechanical creations, we should be using the time to work on training drills.  dude, trust me. this is good.  well, show us, bro. come on.     impressive, but what is it.  it's a... a multiple weapon, nuclear powered, giant robot.  what he said.  cyborg: each of uscontrols a different pieceof the robot.  five titans coming togetherto form a giant force for good.  i've always dreamedabout this.  we have got to take it out,right now.  the robot is designedonly to be used on special occasions.  please.  sorry, bro. when there is a worldthreatening danger, then we can us it.   a waste of perfectly good machinery and awesomeness.    titans, crime alert.  this is the fight we've been preparing for our whole lives.  blorg. what is the crime.  oh, no. is it an attack of giant space cannibals.   i wish that's was all we were dealing with.  zombie demons vaporizing entire cities.  if only.  well, what is it.  bank robbery.   that's right. bank robbery in progress.   and that's a huge threat why.    don't you care about money, and change.   and pennies.  perhaps, it is the villain who is making this crime so dangerous.  yes. a fiendish villain we've tangled with before.  kitten.  kitten, fiendish.  pretty... pretty fiendish, i'd say.  i don't know how we're going to handle this.  uh, the same way, we handle much bigger threats.  wait, there's one thing that might save the world.  we have to take the robot.  so, that's what this is about.  i already said that the robot is supposed to be used for big stuff only.  this is big stuff.  it's a bank robbery.  by kitten. that's right. robot, now, please.  you going to pay for gas. uhhuh, uhhuh.  fine, we'll take the robot. yes.  cyborg: titan robot, assemble.  right leg, power on.  right arm, power on.  left arm, power on.  head, power...  oh, no, you don't. i form the head.  but i'm the leader. the leader is the head.  this is my robot and i drive then, what am i. you're the left leg.   left leg. i don't want be the left leg, legs are lame.  would you two hurry up. smells like celery in here.   fine.   left leg, power on.  head, power on.  all: titan robot, go.     kitten: it's not fair.  those mean bank people made me carry my own stolen money.   so, maybe this was a bad idea.  okay, guys, make sure to follow my lead.  "sure to follow my lead. look at me, i'm the head, i'm so important." i heard that, left leg. right arm, left arm, show her what you've got.  uh, hmm, how about this one.  that was my car. now how am i supposed to get home.  whoa. mrn. yeah. oh.  hey, i've got an idea. why don't i just take the money back.  legs, walk forward.  aye, aye. walk forward. lame.  might i suggest, a power kick. yeah.  whoa, whoa. whoa.  whoa. whoa.  cyborg: robin, cut it out.  hiya. power kick. yeah.  super power kick, left leg style.  yeah.   gyroscopic system redline.  mayday, mayday.  uh, i'll just take the bus.    did we get her.  this is all because you didn't play your part, robin.  you are the left leg. anything your left leg can do, you can do in that robot.  no more, no less. got it.  so, basically, i get to do nothing.  only when you embrace your limitations can you master your capabilities.  you know who said that. leg.  oh, wait. legs can't talk.  stupid left leg.  look at you, just dangling there. "ooh, i'm a left leg." you're nothing but a foot carrier.  you can't even tie your own shoe.   you're right, i am lame.  still insulting your leg.   that's all it's good for.   come on, cheer up, dude.   yeah, it's easy for you to say, you're an arm.  you're awesome. you can grab stuff and punch things.   true, true, but just think about all the things legs can do.   uh, i have and legs are useless.   you need to embrace your legness, and be the best left leg you can be.   you're right.  my name is robin and i am a left leg.     beast boy: mmm.  hey, guys.   dude, that is one gnarly leg.  yup.  nice, huh. )
