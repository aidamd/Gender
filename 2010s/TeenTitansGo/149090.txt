 meful.  what do you have to say for yourself.  well, i for one... not you. your belly.  oh.   i want to learn how to eat the right way.  what about you, sixpack.  i'm up for the challenge, sir.  you ready to get juicy, tangerine.  the belly still cannot speak.    we have a lot of work ahead of us.  well, first things first.  turn in your smile bones, please.  just put them in the bucket.  seriously. you want to learn how to eat or not.   will those be stored in a sanitary manner.  yeah, i put them in the bucket.  now, let's eat.      those bellies are looking ripe.  here's your smile bones back, y'all. you earned it.  oh, that's not right.  this belongs to... this isn't mine.  and that goes to you. thank you.  robin, have you considered eating less of the fish.   noted.  so what do you bellies have to say now.  fill me with food.   it's tummy time.  oh, your belly's still not speaking, huh.   no, the belly can speak.  i'm loving this belly talk.  now get me more food.  why do we have to get you more food.  in the world of the belly, biggest belly is in charge.  and that is us.   fat chance, belly boys, i'm the biggest, i should be in charge.   it should be the majority rule and we are the many.  robin: i'm the biggest belly.  enough, bellies.  there's only one way to settle this thing.  that's right. time to belly up.  oh, i cannot do the inhaling anymore.  our bellies weren't meant to hold this much food.   ugh.   i am an abomination.   ah. thanks for the belly laugh.  your tiny bellies are amusing to me.  yes, brother, their pathetic bellies only exist to serve us now.  whatever.  um... i didn't say that. my belly did.  oh, right we get it, your "belly" said it.  no, really, my belly said that.  that's enough malarkey out of you nonbellies.   mine, too.  it's happening.  what's happening.  i warned you about this.  you've given your bellies too much power and now they've taken control.  cyborg's belly: indeed, we have.  yes, brother, now let us seek out more food.    while they were consuming the food, their obsession with eating was consuming them.  so profound.  there's only one way to fix this.  they have to learn how to enjoy their food.  but before we can take care of those bellies...   we have to take care of these.             so much delicious food, brother.  yes, this world will be very easy to conquer.  bro, this is out of control.  if only we savored our meals we wouldn't be in this situation.  it's time to teach those bellies how to eat.  starfire, raven.  you know what to do.  nice try, but how will they savor these delicious treats without their smile bones.    oh. they took our smile bones, bro.  how are we going to savor our food now.  take ours.  oh, man.  do you eat anything other than fish.  quick, raven, give beast boy your smile bones.  ew, no way. you do it, star.   very well.  hmm. mmm.  that is so good.  what are they doing.  they're enjoying their food.  no.   no, don't do it.  oh, what a world.  well, i sincerely hope we all learned a little bit about the importance of savoring your food.  we sure did.  thanks, robin.  there's just one more thing.  biggest belly is in charge.  funk mancave.  yup, he's gone noseblind.  he thinks it smells fine, but his wife smells this...  luckily for all your hardtowash fabrics there's febreze fabric refresher febreze doesn't just mask, it eliminates odors you've gone noseblind to break out the febreze, and breathe happy flo: hey, big guy.  i heard you lost a close one today.  look, jamie, maybe we weren't the lowest rate this time.  but when you show peopletheir progressive direct rate and our competitors' rates, you can't win them all.  the important part is,you helped them save.  thanks, flo.  okay, let's go get youan ice cream cone, champ.  with sprinkles.  sprinkles arefor winners.  i understand.  aha.  cinnamon. milk. cinnamilk.  cinnamon toast crunch.  part of this good breakfast crunch.  crave those crazy squares.  cinnamilk.     titans. exciting news.  i've just installed a heated hydrotherapy chamber.  not exciting, bro.  would you be more excited, if i told you it was a...  all: hot tub.  now, the hydrotherapy chamber is only for post training soreness.  let us do the time of the party in a large container of warm water.  the jets feel like tiny florthogs nibbling at your norbobs.   bubbles.  everyone out. the tub is for... hot tub.   at least you respect my orders.  oh, it's not that. it's not that at all.  it's because i...  ...can't enjoy hot tubs.   a robot body is great for a lot of things.  looking real shiny.  hacking robin'svery personal data files.  i'm sorry.  and being real,real, real tough.  but enjoying the warm bubbly embrace of a hot tub just isn't one of 'em.  sometimes, i wish i was a real boy again.  but i've searched the world and there's simply nobody who can...  pfft. i can do that. excuse me.  i can make you human again, 'cause, you know, magic.  why didn't you ever say anything before.  come on, it would take way too long to list everything i can do with magic.  we want to hear the list.  fine.  teleportation, telekinesis, fly, read the minds of animals, see in the dark, turn water into any other liquid except for ginger ale...  ...summon meteors, devour the souls of the wicked and perfectly crack open walnuts.  all: wow. walnuts are hard to open.  okay, enough yammering.  i got some hot tubbing to do.  is this going to hurt.  nope, i won't feel a thing. ha.  and you guys say i'm not funny.  but seriously, this will be extremely painful.  azarath metrion zinthos.   cyborg: the agony. the agonizing...  the agonizing agony.      raven, you did it. i'm human again.  now, i have to warn you, your human nervous system is very sensitive compared to your robot body.  all i'm hearing is hot tub. hot, hot, hot, hot tub.   i'm being cooked alive.   why was the hot tub so hot.  because you're human and humans feel way more pain than robots.  yeah, sorry, cyborg, but it's... hang on.  wow.  we can't even call you cyborg anymore, can we.  you can't. yeah, bro.  you're just a fleshy guy now.  fleshy guy.  that can be your new name.  man, i'm so great at naming things.  i'm not sure i want to be...  fleshy guy. the flesh guy.  you don't want to be a cyborg again, do you.  no, i just have a lot to learn about being a real boy, that's all.  that's the spirit, fleshy guy.   i'll be your guide to being a human.  just follow me.   you still like food.  well, you're going to love it even more, fleshy guy.     these snacks taste so much better in my human belly.  that's what i'm saying, fleshy guy.   this is so good.   if you think that's good, wait till you try this.  once every 300 years, all major food groups align in the cosmos.  taco, burger, hot dog, pizza, all coming together as one to form el burdigato supreme.   oh...  my human belly.  huh, maybe we overdid it just a little.   what was that. that's the burdigato.       cyborg: hey, beasty,can you comein here for a second.   why. you need help.   what are you doing with your feet in there.  it's been a while since i've used one of these, okay.   great first day, fleshy guy.  isn't being a human awesome.  why is it so hard to move my body.  'cause you're tired, dude. happens to all of us.  you just need to recharge your batteries.  that i can do.     i can see where you might have misunderstood me there.   good morning, the flesh guy.  ah, you decided to sleep in, huh.  sleep in. i barely slept at all.  this human body just keeps sloshing around and making weird noises.  today, i just want to relax and read comic books.  ow, what happened.  that is a cut of the paper.  it happens to those of us without metal hands.  well, i don't like it.  ow.    beast boy: got to watch those toes, bro.  what is wrong with your weird soft bodies.  i can't take this anymore.  i... i can'ti can't...   poor, the fleshy guy.  i feel sad about his sad.  maybe i should go check on him.  no, this is a real boy problem.  it should be handled by...  a real boy.    i just want...    i want my face back...   hey, is there a real boy in here that needs cheering up.   hey, hey, fleshy guy, being a human boy isn't that bad, you know.  are you kidding. it's horrible.  i can't imagine anybody living a single day like this.  oh, right, sorry.  sure, we humans can't fly or lift cars or reach the top shelf without a step ladder.  i can reach it just fine. you're short.  hmm. there are plenty of really awesome things about being human.  so go back to being a robot if you want, but first, let me take you on a real boy adventure.  man: real boy

all the highlights of the last yearin the form of pictures, in the form of a book.  absolutely not.  yearbooks are only popularity contests that leave people with hurt feelings.  tell them this is a bad idea, robin.  popularity contest.  popularity contest.  may i sign the yearbook.  sure, i still have some space in the corner of this page.  i want to sign it too, your majesty.  keep in touch with me, bro.  i want you to have a good summer.  whoa. whoa. one at a time.  one at a time.  a yearbook is a great idea.  my notable achievements will finally be recognized in print.  like "best hair" and "class clown".  class clown. you're not funny.  only the yearbook can say for sure.  finally, i can prove i'm socially superior to all of you.  indeed.  what is the first step in the making of the yearbook.  picture day, girl.  ah. ooh.  so good. silkie, you are working it, buddy.  the camera is in love with you.  next.  cyborg: next.  smile, tiger.   next. let's get this over with.  how

world how beautiful you...    next.  handsome devil.  next.   i have to nail this photo.  ha. whoo.  chacha. hiyaw. ha.  dude, how about a smile.   sorry.  cool dudes don't smile.  oh, come on, rob, give us a little smile for the birdie.   oh, you...  you think a dog toy is going to make me smile.  cyborg: we're two birds of a feather, aren't we, robin.  i want to be your friend.   he's my friend.  got it.  no.  well, picture day was a disaster. )
