  but she can't.  why would we wish to be the boys.  because of one simple fact.  boys are better than girls.   how can one say one gender is superior to the other.  well, starfire,  if you ever took the knowledge train down town to the corner of science and fact, you'd know girlscan never compete with boys, about howthey look and being emotional.   uh, lying around.  you're the ones who are lazy.  and you spend much more time on your hair appearance than do we.  and if you're going to bring up emotional...  stop yelling at us.   oh, my selfesteem.  still think boys are better.  of course they are. in fact, i could go on and on about all the reasons girls are worse than boys, but i'm going to sum it up in just one word...  cooties.   you're crawling with them.  we don't want your cooties.  as you can see from this chart, created by a boy, science tells us that there is no evidence in girls of sugar, spice or anything nice.  what there is, is cooties.  oh, gross.  gross indeed, beast boy.  i rest my case.   i have the cooties.  no, you don't. cooties aren't real.  if boys are so much better, then prove it.  we challenge you to a contest, boys vs. girls.   very well.  okay, 10 laps around the island.  i wish you the luck that is good, beast boy.  you're going down, girl. it's cheetah time.  on your mark, get set...   what took you so long.  first one to solve this complex math equation wins.  you're going down.   don't forget the factor...  raven: done.   dig deep.  be the future. be the future.    the pull.  come on, star, we got this.    well, girls win.  dude, you lied to us. girls are better than boys.  yeah, boys are terrible.  from now on, we're girls.  yeah.  whoa. but what about the cooties.  don't worry, girls, he lied about that too.  you look cootie free to me.  so, girls, you see that sporting event...  uh, i mean, um, did you guys... argh... what...  what exactly do you two do anyway.  yeah, come to think of it, what do you girls do.  well, you know, i read from my spell book...  while fighting an evil demon.   you get 'em, girl.  oh, man. epic. get 'em, that's my girl.  what about you, star.  well, i make glordnorb pudding, with the salivaof a giant klatar.  ohhoho.  i love giant klatars.  raven: that's how we roll.  cootie free. we'll see about that.  all right, you dirty cooties, do your thing.   cyborg: hey. i'm trying to sleep.  sorry.   cyborg: i can still hear you.  still. yes.  ugh, a boy.  ew. he smells.  so, you boys enjoying being girls.  it's the best. girls rule.  girls. girls. girls. girls.  are you done.   g...g...g...g... girls.  girls. girls.  g...g...g...g... girls. g...g...g...g...  girls.  something wrong.  i do not feel alone in my clothes.  yeah, my skin is crawling.  ooh, tsktsktsk. hmm, you know what that sounds like.   cooties.  they're real. they're real.  we do not have the cooties.  oh. it's true, girls have cooties.  we want to be boys again.  you did this to us.  yes. and i can undo it, with this.  it's a cootie catcher.  oh, please, give us the catcher of the cooties.  i'll be happy to, if you admit that boys are better than girls.  never.  then you're stuck with cooties.  you know, all we have to do is touch you and you'll have cooties too.  ahhh, cooties.  but, starfire touching me...  ahhh, cooties.  or the start of a beautiful relationship.  ahhh, cooties. run.   think we lost them.  impossible.  we have more of the endurance.  psst...   follow me, i know a place they'll never find us.  beast boy: shh. we'll be safe in here.  cyborg: ugh, safe, you know, 'cause we're in one.  raven: we're smarter too.   and we are the stronger.   now everyone is having the cootie.  so, you've got no choice but to use the cootie catcher.  you win. again.  and now the cooties are caught.    i am alone in my clothes once more.  let's face it guys, the girls are better than us.  they're stronger, faster, smarter.  they're our superiors in every way.  we shouldn't let a day go by without thanking them for even noticing that we're alive.  on behalf of all boys, i want to apologize for our actions.  thank you, robin. it's cool.  but you know what, robin.  only a boy can make such an amazing speech.  boys rule.  b...b...b... boys.  please stop.  man trust dial for men power scrub to give us a clean we can be proud of.  over engineered with unstoppable orange oil and micro

i've seen this before.  a virus has invaded your body. and it's destroying you from the inside out.  you are dying.  this is awesome.  yeah, why.body adventure.  that's why.  it's every superhero's dream to shrink down to the size of a germ and to explore the miracle of the body.  that ain't my dream.  yeah, gross. think about it.  robin: surfing on blood cells,climbing a rib cage, swimming in the stomach,i'll take down thoseviruses, manoagermo.   hyah. you know...  dy adventure.  sorry, you aren't crawling all up in this.  it's just a cold.  and it's going to kill you, cyborg. maybe.   panic.  you can't go inside him, robin. it's not like we have a...  "brand new shrink ray i just bought".   uh, dude, are you sure it's new.  yeah, they don't sell junk at the swap meet.  now, stand aside.  body adventure. body adventure. body adventure.  robin, are you not supposed to be much smaller.  i think that's as far as it goes.  huh, no problem.  this can still work.   cyborg, open wide.   robin: body adventure.   do not worry, cyborg, i shall maneuver your heimlich.    oh, no, is the ray of shrinking broken.  looks like it.  then robin's stuck as a baby.  oh, it's okay, my babywaby.  our li'l cocomocochucka... ow.  bad baby. bad.  okay, titans, change of plans.  body adventure is canceled, but operation big world is a go.  whoohoo. everything's huge.  this is awesome.  i am so hungry, one pizza won't be enough.  and while you starve, i'll live for an entire week on this single topping.   how am i going to finish this all.  the food just keeps coming.  i am stuffed.    whoohoo. silky horse.    robin.  oh, i did not see you enter.  exactly.  being tiny really increases my ninja stealth skills.  what's that behind your ear.   it's me. i can be anywhere at any time and you would never know.  anyway, just pretend i'm not here.  can't seem to shake this cold.  i stepped on tiny robin.  no, you stepped on my cherry tomato.  now what am i going to use as a bowling ball.  dude, we need to talk.    sounds like your cold is getting worse.  just say the word and i'll write you a prescription for a...  body adventure.  stop with the body adventure.  my body is not an adventure to be had.  we think you should unshrink yourself, robin.  indeed, i feel like i am being watched wherever i go.  and i'm just not ready to be a father yet.  no way.  being tiny is awesome.  check this out.  i made a mountain out of flour and these carrot sticks are my skis.  whoohoo.  and, if you think that's cool, check out my new boomerang.  i made it out of a toenail.   all: ugh.  that's it.  if you're going to stay small, you cannot be our leader.  robin: what. we're big people dealing with big problems.  we need you up here. now what do you say.   never. i love my tiny life.   silky horse.  what are you doing.  i've decided to shrink the entire team.  but the ray is broken. not anymore.  i was able to fix and improve it with my tiny hands.  let's do it. tiny titans, go.  now enough of this  shrinking nonsense.   it's time to...     what happened to my body.  the virus has gotten so bad that it's shut down all your systems.  exactly like i told you it would.  we're going to need more soup.  or, you know, real medicine.  no, it's already too late.  we only have one option.  oh, no, no, no, no, no.  body adventure.  where are we.  looks like we're lost in the carpet.  not for long.  let's climb something tall to get our bearings.   ooh, that looks kinda far.  perhaps we should have gotten closer to my body first.     oh, hey, it's jerry, my favorite flea.  flea you later, jerry.  starfire: we have not moved but a few inches closer.  we're never going to make it. i'm going to die here, sick, tiny and alone.  not on my tiny watch. i have an ace up my sleeve.   silky horse.   we finally made it. body adventure.  ah.  beast boy: oh.  wow.  where are we.  ugh, i think it's the stomach.   whoa, this is most unpleasant.  come on, this is great.  who wants to surf this hot dog.  easy. ugh.  this is... this is fun...   like a big old swimming pool.   body adventure.  yuck.  oh, well... aah, that tastes gross.   there's more fun to be had in the body.  follow me.   body adventure.  hmm... where to next.  i know, let's hit the rib cage for some awesome climbing.  would not the virus most likely inhabit his air sacks.  yeah, probably.  fine.  beast boy: ugh. it's so slimy.  ugh, it's like you were inhaling jelly, cyborg.   so fun.  mucus vines.  don't do that. it tickles.    oh, gross.   i need a shower.  okay, robin, maybe we should just take cyborg to a doctor.  no, we came in here to fight some viruses in an awesome showdown and that's what we're going to do.  look, there's one now. what's up, guys.   titans, go.  i would rather the not. i am not touching that thing.  gross, dude. uh, no thanks.     everything in this body is sticky and smelly and weird.  i thought a body adventure would be awesome but it's just gross.  come on, let's get out of here.  i'll just be over here, inflaming some membranes and spreading mucus and what have you.  how do we save poor cyborg now.  starfire: oh. raven: ugh.  maybe try calling a doctor.  fine. azarath metrion zinthos.    woman: 911, what's your emergency.  raven: you got to help us.  what.   sorry, i can't understand you.  is this some kind of joke.  raven: no, no, no, no, no, don't hang up.   day and sometimes, an even longer night.  helping with homework before doing your own.  and you may think no one notices...  but she does.  she sees more than "mom," she sees determination.  we do too.  for nearly 40 years, we've
