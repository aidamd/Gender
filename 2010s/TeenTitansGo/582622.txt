sign for silkie.  like we would ever returnour beloved house pet to that villainous lunatic.  yeah, that would justcrush starfire.  wait, i'm not surekiller moth made this sign.  i think a snake wrote it. see.   those are dollar signs, beast boy.  he's offering a cash reward for the return of silkie.  cash. dinero.  moola. buckaroos.  you know, i bet killer moth really misses silkie.  if i lost a pet, i'd probably want him back, too.  perhaps, our selfishness has blinded us and we should return him.  it is the right thing to do.  al "and that is howthe beautiful princess "mercilessly killedall her enemies and became queen.  "the end."  now, it is the bath time.   ew.  do you not think the daily ritual of bathing is necessary.  not when you do it on the couch, with your tongue.  i have found it is the best way to evacuate the most stubborn gunk.  for being such a good silkie, i shall now share my zorkaberries.    ew, ew, ew.  we are merely sharing our mutual affection.  silkie's only affection is for that bowl of food.   do not listen to her, silkie.  her insights are dark.     you, mdarlings, will rise up and take over the world.    killer moth.  the teen titans, you shall not defeat me.  i have been...   save it. we here about the flyer.  larva m319.  i missed you so much.  my special little guy is back.  this is embarrassing. you guys seeing me like this. just look away.  thank you so much for returning him.  all: it was the right thing to do.  well then, good bye.  okeydokey. see you the next time i try to destroy the world.  you're waiting for the reward, aren't you.   oh, my gosh, there was a reward.  oh, you didn't have to.  we were just trying to do the right thing.   oh, silkie.   really.  the silkie has gone missing.  i found this at the location of the criminal action.  it indicates that a snake has stolen the silkie.  see.  uh, no. i think someone just returned him to killer moth for a reward.  but, who would do such a thing.  the killer moth is a bad man.  what's there to worry about. he's a bug.  the killer moth will not lick behind his ears.  and he most definitely has horrible plans for the silkie.  i'll tell you something, and it's... this may sound harsh, but...  silkie is incapable of loving you the way you love him.   no. you are wrong, raven.  i know the silkie loved me more than any  raven...  oh, silkie.   whoa. i've never seen so many zeros in a row.  i don't know how to spend this much money.  you're right. what are we going to do.  wait, who's the richest person you know.  scrooge mcduck.  that's right. so, how would he spend his money, yo.  . we're rich, oooooo.  . this whole placeis filled with money )
