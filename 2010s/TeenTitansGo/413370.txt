 all: sorry.  why don't you try reading a book.  ind whistling) what is so special about the books.  well, starfire, books are a world of imagination.  they cate pictures in your mind.  come on. you're just sitting there looking at words.  words can take you on an imagination adventure.   you know, i've heard tell of this but, you know, i've never seen it in action.  uh...  i'd like to go on an imagination adventure.  can we, uh, see one.  sure.  beast boy: the return ofthe invisible man.    my imagination is going into overdrive.  robin: biographyof benjamin franklin.  this is so amazing.  cyborg:the adventures of pinocchio.  this is so magical.  starfire: the birdwatcher'sguide to pelicans.   my brain has never been so alive.  reading is fundamental, yo.  "geppetto held pinocchio's hand "and showed him how to put one foot after the other."  oh... huh.  oh, how interesting.     invisible man, you are the coolest.   books are the best thing ever.  why did i not try the reading before.  the world of imagination is awesome.   if only we could take our love of reading to a new level.  well, i've always wanted to start a book club.  they have clubs...for books.  i want to be a member. me, too.  me number after two.     so, uh, how is this supposed to work, raven.  well, book clubs share comments about the books they've read.  i loved my book.  the pelicans are funny. they give me the splinknards...   my book was crazy fun.  it was filled with so much adventure.  my book had science, and science is cool.  guys, it's more than just sharing feelings, it's about sharing thoughts.  what's a thought.   uh. let me show you.   i found my book's premise to be unconvincing.  the plot twists trite and the philosophical underpinning a strained attempt at significance.   what did you just do, rave.  i think she just took the fun out of reading.  quick, beast boy, tell us about your book.  i love my book so much i wrote a song about it.  beast boy:. my book has a front and a back . with paper in the middle . got a lot of words in itsome are big, some are little . with numbers on each pageyou can't get lost . so when i crack my book openman, i read like a boss . i love the feel of the paperthe smell of the ink . it challengesmy brain muscles . man, it's making me think . it's my book, babythere ain't no other like it . it's my book, baby what... .    wait, rave.  what.  we, uh...  we finished reading all of our books.  and.  we needs new books to read.  why don't you just read each other's books.  you are a nasty girl, that is just gross.  i don't know what to tell you.  our eyes are hungry for the letters arranged in punctuated patterns that convey meaning.  don't you understand, girl.  we got the need, the need to read.  you gotta get us more books, man.  you can't start us reading and then cut us off.  reading is fundamental.   get it together.  oh, this is bad. this is real bad.   i can feel my imagination dying.  it hurts.  there must be more books around here somewhere.  let's split up.  titans, go.    no books in here.   no books under the couch.    what's up, fellas.  listen, listen, i have found one.  robin: wait. that's a comic book.  starfire: is not a comic book a type of book.  cyborg: it doesn't count if it has pictures.  beast boy: ahh. this could never feed our imagination.   i think i hear a book in here.   man, i am having some serious deja vu right now.  nothing.    i smell a book.   bingo.  oh, who is the good boy. who is the good boy.  robin: you sure there's a book in there.  only one way to find out.   cyborg: look, it's got a face.  ooh, i love faces.  oh, joy. it is smiling at me.  let's read it.  you guys found another book.  uhhuh, uhhuh. and it has a face.   not that book. you can't read that one.  we have to. it's gonna fuel our imaginations.  but not in a good way. that book's evil, that's why i buried it.  too late. all: ooh. aah.    i told you not to open it.  it's unleashing all the things you've imagined.  well, how do we stop it.  you have to turn off your imaginations.    i can't do it.   why did the biography of benjamin franklin...  ...have to be so...  ...compelling.  you made reading too much fun, raven.     there has to be a way of making books boring.  what might turn our imaginations off again.   that's it. we have to take the fun out of reading.   who's going first.   um, the premise that a man might become invisible is, like, totally farfetched and resists even the most strenuous suspensions of disbelief, bro.  while the biography goes over some welltrodden ground, ultimately it reminds us why franklin is one of our most fascinating founding fathers.  we're doing it. we're making reading boring.  keep it up, guys.   the author's understanding of the ancient egyptian's associations of pelicans with death and the afterlife seem tenuous, to say the least.   the climactic appearance...  ...of the blue fairy and her subsequent humanization of the little wooden boy serve to symbolically demonstrate...  ...the overcoming of lesser impulses in order to discover one's real self.  it's over.  i'm gonna destroy this book so it can never hurt anyone again.   you should have warned us.  reading isn't just fundamental, it's dangerous.  we almost died because of books, rave.  i hope this doesn't do anything to diminish your love of reading.    awkiquawkiquawkiquawkiquawkiqu ho.   oh.  .     ah.   you can discover the happy meals freaky fab side when you choose a monster high accessory and the goodness of
