  ooh, cool. can i play.  sorry, bro. we only have two controllers.  yeah. sorry, bro.  that's okay.  i didn't feel like playing my favorite video game in the whole wide world anyway.   what is it.  oh, it's just...  beast boy and my double are, like, best friends now.  and you want sympathy from me.  you are the one who cast the spell.  you tricked me into casting it.  it's your fault you lost your best friend.   what.  well, since i need a new best friend, i thought maybe you could make a magical double of beast boy.  you're unbelievable. okay.  then could you at least duplicate this controller so i can play video games with them.  fine.  azarath metrion zinthos.  psyche.     hey, what's up.   you're me.  correction. i'm you.     both: awesome.   you've got to be kidding me.  this is great. now, i have a new best friend.  right, beast boy.  whoa. you're a magical double. just like me.  wanna be best friends. okay.  no. wait. we're supposed to be best friends.  sorry, cyborg. i just have more in common with cyborg.  later.  but... ohh.  good going, cy. now, neither one of us has a best friend.  perhaps the two of you could just be best friends again.   this guy.  as if. not.  wanna get something to eat.  sure.  so, there are four of them now, huh.  i don't wanna talk about it.  i'm starving.  i left a big bag of tofu chipsright here on the...table.  looks like someonebeat us to it.  don't worry. we've still got a tub of ice...  crud.  duplicate cyborg: thanks for the snacks.    duplicate beast boy: you're the best.  the worst part is, they put the tub back in the freezer even though it's empty.  i mean, who does that.  us, apparently.  forget the snacks. we'll just play some video games.    all yours.  aw, man. you busted the controller.  and this one's covered in icecream. ew.  i mean, mmm.   are we really that annoying.  in a word, yes.  now you know how we feel.  now, then...  all in favor of kicking the magical doubles out of titans tower and letting them fend for themselves on the mean streets of jump city, raise your hand.  all opposed.  looks like you lose.  look again, bro.  no way.  i didn't do it.  we found raven's spell book and figured out how to cast the spell ourselves.  all in favor of kicking out every nonmagical double.  i'll actually kind of miss that place.  we shared lots of good memories there.  we sure...  wait. i don't really have any memories in the tower.  me neither.  come to think of it, i don't remember a single thing before a couple of months ago.  how could that be. unless...  cyborg: so you're saying you think beast boy and me are magical doubles, too.  yup. i checked cyborg's credit card statement and tracked his pizza deliveries to this apartment.  then the real deal should be in there.   man: help me. help me. i'm dying.  titans, go.   help me. help me. i'm dying.  you've got five lives left, man. no big deal.  do you mind explaining yourselves.  sure, just let us clear this level.  now.  okay. sheesh.  we found raven's spell book and figured out how to duplicate ourselves.   so, yeah, we decided to take a little vaycay, and let our doubles take our place, man.  all of this time we have been living with magical doubles.   yup.  well, thanks to you two clowns, the tower is now overrun with doubles.  we thought that might happen.  which is why we have a contingency plan.        so, what is to become of these two magical doubles.  don't worry about us, we've seen the error of our ways, and we're committed to becoming better people.  we're gonna be hobos.  "ride the rails," that sort of thing.  so long, titans.   wait. can't you take these two with you.  dude...  i ain't getting up.  i don't think i can get up.  well, i guess that is all wrapped up.  so, where did you send all of those doubles to.  i hate this game.    ro f yes.   two, three, four, five.   yes. knew it.  ooh, what you got.  uh, nothing.  what you got. nothing.  what you got. nothing.    what you got.   yoink.  come on, guys. that's mine.  so, what is it.    it's one of thosefortuneteller games that the little kids play.  ha, ha. robin playsbaby games.  okay, yup. i'm a big baby.can i have it back now.  no way.not till we know our fortune.  you first, beasty. pick a color.  you know my color, bro.  greeeen.    what's my fortune. what's my fortune.  please be "millionaire." "you will...  "...marry starfire." well, it doesn't mean i won't be a millionaire.  now can i get it back.  nope. my turn.  blue. and my fortune is...  "you and starfire will have seven kids." what.  that's gonna be awkward since i'm already marrying her.  cyborg: these are strangely starfirespecific fortunes.  it's because the fortunes are for me.  oh. ooh.  starfire does make you act a little nuts, doesn't she.  male voice:there was something aboutstarfire that made him nuts.  not the kind of nuts thatput a knot in your stomach or made you wantto climb a mountaintopto shout out your feelings.  your head,voices like mine.  there's this new restaurant opening tonight that she wants to try, but i don't know how to ask.   we can help you.  really.  me and cyborg have asked out tons of girls.  and they went out with you.  no. of course not.  but we asked.  so, sit right there and learn from the masters.   please. just go out with me.  if you say no, i don't know if i could take it anymore.  please. please. please.  think this is the wrong approach.  oh, please don't say no.  i already love you though.  just be yourself.  beast boy: just go out with me.    hi, starfire.  hey, starfire.   hey, starfire.  hola, starfire.  no.  starfire: enter.  yes, robin.     uh...   is this a game.      thank you, robin. your game was most enjoyable.  uh, yes. good times, huh.  wait. star, there...   there was something else.  you know, that new restaurant is opening tonight, uh, i thought maybe you'd like to go.   i would love to.  you would. indeed.  but i cannot. speedy has already asked me to go with him.  speedy. how's it going, robin.  speedy.  male voice: speedy had alwaysbeen the chief rival of robin.  first as a sidekick, then a hero, endearingalien princess.  at that moment,robin knew he would doanything in his power to stop speedyfrom winning over starfire.  even though reason saidhe should be more concerned with the voicehe kept hearing in his head.  this guy. are you kidding.  how can you stand to look at that face.  i'm standing right here.  ugh. not to mention that voice.  i have always felt you two share many visual and auditory similarities.  don't you get it, star. he's all wrong for you.  is that not the purpose of the date.  to find out if one is compatible.    whoa. what's wrong.  speedy already asked her.  oh, bummer, dude.  it's okay.  are you sure you're okay. you have that look again.  i have a plan.  why is speedy tied to a chair.  and in his underwear.  speedy has a date with starfire tonight, and i'm going to keep it.  something tells me he's about to blow any chance he has with starfire forever.  just keep an eye on him for me, okay.  sorry, dude. we would never do something like this.  would you do it for a scooby snack.  done and done. oh, yeah.   what am i doing. tying speedy up, taking his place.  i can't go through with this.  male voice: finally,robin had come to his senses.  compromisehis conscience.  hello, speedy.  yup. that's me. i'm speedy.  have a seat. why, thank you, speedy.  i find your being a gentleman compatible with several traits i possess.   ha. never gets old.  okay, very funny, guys.  come on, let me go. both: no.  let me go. both: no.  let me go. both: no.  let me go. sorry, dude. not till after the date.   okay.  thank you.  let me go. both: no.  let me go. both: no.  let me go. both: no.  let me go. both: no.   let me go. both: no.  let me go. both: no.  let me go.  oh. kidnapping is so boring.  you wanna get something to eat. what about him.  let me go. both: no.  hey, rave.  will you watch speedy for us.  like a hawk.  you're the best.  exit's the other way.  starfire: is this really necessary, speedy.  totally. this is what i do on all of my dates.   oh. score.  i am beginning to wish i declined your invitation tonight in favor of robin's.  wait, but i thought you said robin and i were basically the same.  i was factually incorrect.  you have nothing in common with robin.  goodbye, speedy.  yes.   no.  robin, what are you doing here.  that's what i wanted to talk to you about.  it's time you learned the...  excuse me.     i used to think your staff was lame, but this is kinda fun.   i'll take these.   are you okay, robin.  speedy has been acting quite strangely.  yeah. i think he's a little... you know.  male voice: he's not the onewho's hearing voices.  don't make me come in there.  i learned something important today, robin.  perhaps i have taken you for granted.  you are the kindest, most honest...  male voice: robin had finallywon starfire over,but at what cost, he wondered.  yes, robin was ashamedof the way he acted, but deep down,there was still a good person.  he knew if he were to livewith himself tomorrowhe'd have to come clean today.  so he did.he told her everything.  and hearing his actionsout of his own mouthonly made him feel worse.  his actionswere just terrible.  terrible.  you probably hate me, don't you.  robin, you did all that for me.  i did. does that mean you're...  you are out of your gourd.  male voice: that's whati've been trying to tell him.  huh.i don't believe we've met.  i'm the voice in robin's head.  and i am...  absolutely stunning.   it is nice to meet you, disembodied voice.  what do you sayyou and me get out of here.  i would like that.  after you, my dear.   and what startedas a chance encounterbetween a voice and a girl, would soon blossominto the most wonderful...  are you coming.uh, sorry. be right there.  and now for our last creditscore challenge, let's see who can sign up morequickly.  good luck.  it won't give me my credit score until i put in a credit card.  yes.  credit karma dot com is free andyou don't need a credit card.  credit karma dot com, where freeis really free.  titans go.  as soon as we get an alert on my communicator.  hopefully, at any moment now.    crime.  more like microwave popcorn.  want some. make me a bag.  but remain vigilant.  it must not burn.  ayeaye. weirdo.   we've gone a whole weekwithout a crime alert.  i think it's startingto get to him.  yeah, robin isdefinitely going through mission withdrawal.  that would explainthe involuntary eye movement.  titans. all:  what.  still nothing to report.  come on, dude.  chill out.  yes, robin.  perhaps you should take advantage of the lull in criminal activities in order to do "the relax." relax.   uh, you do know how to relax, don't you.   i can relax circles around you fools.  says the guy who tried to turn sleeping into a competitive sport.  on your mark, get set, sleep.   well, it's just as leader, i'm not used to going this long without doing something productive.  but, i can totally take it easy until there's an alert.  good, 'cause that's what we're gonna do.  ah, something happen, please.   you are just the prettiest, high performance, lowemission muffler i've ever seen.  yes, you are.  hey, cyborg. you relaxing.   i was.  mind if i join you. yes.  looks like we've got a lot of work ahead of us if we want this to be ready for the next mission.  i'm just tinkering, robin. not trying to save the world.  i bet we could rebuild this whole engine pretty quick.  knock it out in 15, 16 hours tops.    ooh. you mind relaxing somewhere else.   enter.  care to join me in the earth relaxation ritual of a spa mask.  i've made mine of gorka berries, pickles )
