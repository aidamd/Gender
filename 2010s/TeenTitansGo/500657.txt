 time to watch everybody's favorite action movie.  ow.  it's not everybody's favorite movie. just yours, jerk.  now the old raven would have just said, "whatever," but you, you say what's on your mind.  i love it.  oh, and i hate it that you scream all the time.  ow. good to know.  just thinking about them gives me a nervous stomach.   oh, no.  you're not going to have to tell me twice.  perhaps a comedy.  comedies make me laugh.  ow. what was that for.  because i love comedies.  this might be the fastest we've ever come to a consensus.  i'm really liking these different ravens.  ow.   nothing's better than pancakes in the morning.   how about this.   i see a giraffe.  is that a llama doing the tango.  can't a person get a decent nondancing breakfast around here.  hey, gang, what's for brea...     titans, go.   ravens, go.  as great as finally knowing how the ravens actually feel is, they're really messing up our battle game.  since the prism split them up, we should be able to use the crystals to trap the ravens and put them back together.  oh. do we have to.  i kind of like this one.  should we be discussing our plan in front of her.  don't worry about me. i don't really care.   but i do.  ow. ow.  you're not going to use that on us.  i don't want to be combined with these losers.  that looks too scary to me.  i'll go if you come with.  i'm good with whatever.  let's get out of here.  robin: looks like they're spreading through the city.  we're going to have to split up to capture all the ravens.  i'm going after purple. no.  oh, come on, please. no.  then beast boy and i will take the most dangerous one.  pink.  oh, yeah, pink.  we may not come back alive.  isn't she the happy one.  when she makes those marshmallow clouds, the cholesterol alone could kill you.  not looking forward to this.  both: see you.   ah. i guess we'll go after the rest.  titans, go.  just go away.   there she is.  gumballs. wink.  yay.  hug.  aww.  both: pink. huh.  both: we missed you.  i missed you, too.  let's have fun.  oh, my gosh. yes.     all: whoa.   bees: go, go, go.  i hope this never ends.  what are you going to do.  the only thing i can do.   robin, be careful.       beast boy. this hamburger is fantastic.  i know, dude. i know.   whoo.  shiny.  both: no.   we've captured all the ravens except for orange.  and we've already searched the whole city for her.  oh, hey.  she has been here the whole time.  and she ate everything in the fridge. how could you.  let's get our raven back.  thanks for making me whole again.  uh, you're being mean, aren't you.  no, really. thanks.  i believe this is the sarcasm.  not being sarcastic at all.  oh, the confusion.  i can't tell what she's trying to say.  just great job, guys.  make it stop. make it stop.  who knew that under that dark cape and darker scowl that a mix of happy, scared, loving, angry, lazy emotions exist.  as much as we love your mechanical creations, we should be using the time to work on training drills.  dude, trust me. this is good.  well, show us, bro. come on.     impressive, but what is it.  it's a... a multiple weapon, nuclear powered, giant robot.  what he said.  cyborg: each of uscontrols a different pieceof the robot.  five titans coming togetherto form a giant force for good.  i've always dreamedabout this.  we have got to take it out,right now.  the robot is designedonly to be used on special occasions.  please.  sorry, bro. when there is a worldthreatening danger, then we can us it.   a waste of perfectly good machinery and awesomeness.    titans, crime alert.  this is the fight we've been preparing for our whole lives.  blorg. what is the crime.  oh, no. is it an attack of giant space cannibals.   i wish that's was all we were dealing with.  zombie demons vaporizing entire cities.  if only.  well, what is it.  bank robbery.   that's right. bank robbery in progress.   and that's a huge threat why.    don't you care about money, and change.   and pennies.  perhaps, it is the villain who is making this crime so dangerous.  yes. a fiendish villain we've tangled with before.  kitten.  kitten, fiendish.  pretty... pretty fiendish, i'd say.  i don't know how we're going to handle this.  uh, the same way, we handle much bigger threats.  wait, there's one thing that might save the world.  we have to take the robot.  so, that's what this is about.  i already said that the robot is supposed to be used for big stuff only.  this is big stuff.  it's a bank robbery.  by kitten. that's right. robot, now, please.  you going to pay for gas. uhhuh, uhhuh.  fine, we'll take the robot. yes.  cyborg: titan robot, assemble.  right leg, power on.  right arm, power on.  left arm, power on.  head, power...  oh, no, you don't. i form the head.  but i'm the leader. the leader is the head.  this is my robot and i drive.  then, what am i. you're the left leg.   left leg. i don't want be the left leg, legs are lame.  would you two hurry up. smells like celery in here.   fine.   left leg, power on.  head, power on.  all: titan robot, go.     kitten: it's not fair.  those mean bank people made me carry my own stolen money.   so, maybe this was a bad idea.  okay, guys, make sure to follow my lead.  "sure to follow my lead. look at me, i'm the head, i'm so important." i heard that, left leg. right arm, left arm, show her what you've got.  uh, hmm, how about this one.  that was my car. now how am i supposed to get home.  whoa. my turn. yeah. oh.  hey, i've got an idea. why don't i just take the money back.  legs, walk forward.  aye, aye. walk forward. lame.  might i suggest, a power kick. yeah.  whoa, whoa. whoa.  whoa. whoa.  cyborg: robin, cut it out.  hiya. power kick. yeah.  super power kick, left leg style.  yeah.   gyroscopic system redline.  mayday, mayday.  uh, i'll just take the bus.    did we get her.  this is all because you didn't play your part, robin.  you are the left leg. anything your left leg can do, you can do in that robot.  no more, no less. got it.  so, basically, i get to do nothing.  only when you embrace your limitations can you master your capabilities.  you know who said that.  did a leg say it. was it a leg.  oh, wait. legs can't talk.  stupid left leg.  look at you, just dangling there. "ooh, i'm a left leg." you're nothing but a foot carrier.  you can't even tie your own shoe.   you're right, i am lame.  still insulting your leg.   that's all it's good for.   come on, cheer up, dude.   yeah, it's easy for you to say, you're an arm.  you're awesome. you can grab stuff and punch things.   true, true, but just think about all the things legs can do.   uh, i have and legs are useless.   you need to embrace your legness, and be the best left leg you can be.   you're right.  my name is robin and i am a left leg.     beast boy: mmm.  hey, guys.   dude, that is one gnarly leg.  yup.  nice, huh.  get that away from me.   gizmo and his robot army are trashing jump city.  we might actually need the robot for this.  you ready to accept being the left leg.  you mean the best part of the body.  uh, yeah. then let's do it.  right arm, power on.  left arm, power on.  right leg, power on.  left leg, power on.  head, power on.  all: titan robot, go.     with my robot army, soon all of jump city will be under my control.   nice tin can. did your mommy make it.  oh, you just made titan robot mad now.  okay, titan robot, let's blast them.  sounds like a job for... the leg.  yes. take that. and this.  since when does the leg fire the blasters.  since i made some improvements to better reflect the left leg's true capabilities.  feet can't hold swords, bro.  mine can.  robin, the robot can't handle this.  you wanted the leg, you're getting the leg.  okay, leg, we're shutting you down.  i don't think so.  ha. how's that taste.  like a sandwich with a whole lot of whooping in it. get him.    this is just too easy.    mayday, mayday, we're going down.    this is why we said everyone has a part to play, robin.  i just wanted to play mine the best i could, but i've learned my lesson.  the only part that counts...  is the left leg.   okay, it's just you and me now.  face to foot.  impossible.   left legs rule.     all: bababababored.  there's nothing to doaround here.  uh, i know, it's so boring.  the dreary time is here for meas well.  titans, i know you're bored.so am i.  but, if we band togetherin defiance of the tyranny of boredom...  ahh. your inspirationalspeech is super boring.  do you mind. i'm trying to read.  all: sorry.  why don't you try reading a book.   what is so special about the books.  well, starfire, books are a world of imagination.  they create pictures in your mind.  come on. you're just sitting there looking at words.  words can take you on an imagination adventure.   you know, i've heard tell of this but, you know, i've never seen it in action.  uh...  i'd like to go on an imagination adventure.  can we, uh, see one.  sure.  beast boy: the return ofthe invisible man.    my imagination is going into overdrive.  robin: biographyof benjamin franklin.  this is so amazing.  cyborg:the adventures of pinocchio.  this is so magical.  starfire: the birdwatcher'sguide to pelicans.   my brain has never been so alive.  reading is fundamental, yo.  "geppetto held pinocchio's hand "and showed him how to put one foot after the other."  oh... huh.  oh, how interesting.     invisible man, you are the coolest.   books are the best thing ever.  why did i not try the reading before.  the world of imagination is awesome.   if only we could take our love of reading to a new level.  well, i've always wanted to start a book club.  they have clubs...for books.  i want to be a member. me, too.  me number after two.     so, uh, how is this supposed to work, raven.  well, book clubs share comments about the books they've read.  i loved my book.  the pelicans are funny. they give me the splinknards...   my book was crazy fun.  it was filled with so much adventure.  my book had science, and science is cool.  guys, it's more than just sharing feelings, it's about sharing thoughts.  what's a thought.   uh. let me show you.   i found my book's premise to be unconvincing.  the plot twists trite and the philosophical underpinning a strained attempt at significance.   what did you just do, rave.  i think she just took the fun out of reading.  quick, beast boy, tell us about your book.  i love my book so much i wrote a song about )
