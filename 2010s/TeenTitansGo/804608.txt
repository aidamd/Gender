 i did not. i was doing the handstands.  and before that i had the toasts from france for breakfast.  and before that i was asleep and before that i read the book.  and before that i brushed each of my tooths.   yeah, okay, okay. i've heard enough.  one last question.  do you love me.  yes.  did you just lie to me.  yes.  i did not wish to hurt the feelings.   i see.  could you learn to love me.  no. very well.  is there any circumstance where... no.  thank you for your time.  are you sure.  do not eat that taco.  you'll contaminate a possible crime scene.  crime scene. what are you talking about, dude.  inside you're tummy.  i didn't eat your sandwich, dude.  i'm a vegetarian.  or are you.  raven, transport me into beast boy's stomach.  okay.   aw, maybe i should have shrunk him firs    no sign of the sandwich in there.  dude, come on.  going inside beast boy, injecting starfire, hacking my very sensitive files.  i don't even know what you did to raven.  he asked, i said no. really, that's all.  you must release yourself of this sandwich obsession, robin.  let it go, dude.  no way. never letting things go is what makes me a good crime fighter.  oh, come on, man.  you gotta let some things go.  like what are you going to do when starfire marries some dude.  plans have been made. now, let's see.   the thief was smart, agile, welltrained.  so that eliminates all of you.  i got it.  it's so obvious.  there's only one person that could have gotten past my defenses.  me.  you ate of the sandwich.  not me now, future me.  it's so clear.  i never got over the taste of that perfect sandwich.  i was so haunted by it that i traveled back in time to eat it again before i ever ate it in the first place.  robin has left the tower.  seriously, man, let it go.  never. to the time machine.  beast boy: where'd you get a time machine.   robin: there i am.  let's get me.  you guys coming. nah, we're just gonna hang here.   honey, i'm home.   i'm just kidding. i live alone.   where is it.  whoa, young me.  how's it going. don't plalay dumb.  just remember. anything i do to my body now affects yours in the future.  now talk.  huh.  okay, then we'll do it the hard way.  aw. ugh.  you feel that, future self.  uh, i guess i remember it hurting.  oh yeah. how about this.   how about that.  oh, yeah.  that totally stung.  robin, stop.  you are injuring yourself over the sandwich.  oh, the perfect sandwich.   that's what this is all about.  yeah, i was super bummed when that vanished.  but you learn to let things go.  now, i know you're lying.  i would never let anything go.  besides, i don't need your confession.  you're me and i know me.  there's only one place i'd put it.  the sandwich is in your refrigerator.  whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on. let's not go crazy here.  see, no sandwich.  just sadness.  no. that's impossible.  so long, weirdo.  ah. it is nice to have visitors.   man, i'm bored.  argh, i know.  oh, lets prank call our future selves.  yeah.    hello, is this cyborg.  i was wondering if your refrigerator is running.  then you better catch it. booyah.   my turn, my turn, my turn.     hi.   is beast boy there.   he did.  how.  really.  well, um, i'm sorry to hear that.   dude, are you okay.    that was a bad idea.  we still on the sandwich thing.  yeah. i got it.  old me did steal the sandwich, but then the sandwich...  grew legs and walked away.  legs. no, stay with me, cyborg that's ridiculous.  it floated away.  of course it did, robin.   we should call the doctor.  to the teleporter.  we don't have a teleporter.  oh, where are we now.  i made that sandwich, uh, a little too perfect.  so perfect that when old me didn't eat it immediately, it evolved intoa superintelligence natureof the universe.  robin, perhaps it is time to simply let it go.   let it go.  never.  robin: sandwich, where are you.  i am sorry your sandwich went missing, but it's definitely not here on some alien planet...   welcome, travelers.  it is i, the perfect sandwich.  after future robin stole me, i escaped from his onebedroom apartment and came here to ponder the universe.  huh, i told you.  and through meditation, i have realized life's greatest secret.  oh, tell us please.  that the sandwich is the supreme form of life and all others must be destroyed.  goodbye.   titans, go.    oh.  ahhh. ahhh.   ahhh.   nothing can destroy the perfect sandwich.  nothing except the mouth of its creator.  what are you waiting for. for you to say it.  say what.  that i was right. you should never let things go.  fine, in some situations... nope, never.  you were right, robin, and you should never let the things go.  thank you.     perfect.   no, i did not know that.  just look at whatthe security camerascaught him saying about his best friend beast boy.  dude, i think beast boy'ssuper lame and so annoying.  ah.  cyborg, how could you.  what. i never said...  that was taken out of context.  wecaught beast boy saying.  yeah, bro. cyborg is grossand stupid and super weird.  what.  you really think i'm super weird.  guys, obviously he just edited those clips together to make you look bad.  you're the one who's annoying.  i'm not the one who's gross, not me.   okay, okay, you're gonna miss the best part.  afraidto tell you the hard truth.  vote for robin.  this message was paidfor by the teen titansand endorsed by robin.  the views expressedmay or may not be accurate.  any resemblancesto real personsis purely coincidental.   oh, that was very well made, robin.  what was all that about.  the election for team leader is coming up.  and i'm ready to do whatever it takes to win.  but i'm not even running against you. no one is.  exactly. i crush my opponents even before they start.  how do you think george washington became the first president.  by inspiring a country with is military leadership and humility.   that's lame.  i would have been a better president than that doofus.  do we even vote for team leader.  don't you remember last year.  one vote for robin.  oh, and no one else voted.  that makes it official. robin is reelected as team leader.  congratulations, robin.   thank you, thank you. it is an honor.  you're going to do great, you handsome little man.   i'm expecting another landslide victory.  so, you losers better not even think about running against me.  can i count on your vote.  whoo. whoo.   titans, go.       friends, look. the television is speaking of us.  breaking news.the teen titans save the day again and it's all caught on video.  oh, this must be from my epic victory against the h.i.v.e. yesterday.  your victory. we were all there.  funny. that's not how i remember it.  let's just watch the video i provided the local news station.   really, bro. how could you.  yes, robin, how could you keep your four amazing quadruplet brothers a secret for all of these years.  i wish to meet the one with the physique similar to mine.  no. how could you take credit for our work.  i have no idea what you're talking about.  but i think we can all agree the video proves i would make the best leader.    he has finally gone too far.  someone needs to talk some sense into him.  and i know exactly who.   hey, what's up guys.  robin, we feel you have lost the vision of what is most important in a leader.  so, i used a time machine to bring one of history's greatest leaders here to remind you what leadership is all about.     it is a pleasure to make your acquaintance.  whoa, george washington.  the one and only.  dude, who's that old lady.  show some respect.  i think it's the grandma who's on the back of the dollar bill.  oh, money grandma.  she's rad.  being a true leader, robin, is like being a gardener.  you must tend to your friends like you might a small sapling.  for only by working togethertowards a common goal can a true teamwith the strengthof a mighty oak be formed.  i think i understand.  you want to run for team leader against me.  i will ruin you, washington.  robin, you misunderstand.  he merely... such insolence.  alright, you little red coat. if you want to test my mettle, you shall find me ready to deliver a quality trashing indeed.  bring it on.  i will bring it on.  take that, georgie porgie. stop it.  stop it. stop it now. oh, you're still with the old school.   beast boy & cyborg: fight. fight, fight.  fight. fight.  was this your plan, raven.  more or less.   you get him, money grandma.             my brave friends, together we can form a more perfect team.  a group brought together by discipline to stop evil in its tracks and truly earn the name titan.   preach to us, money grandma. you've got this, money grandma.     it has been said of my opponent that he cannot tell a lie.   guilty as charged.  earlier today, did you not ask, "do you smell that." in regards to a noxious odor.   i recall that, yes.  yes, okay. then i ask you, good sir, where you not in fact responsible for that odor.   i... well, you see, here's the thing.  you are evading.  no. no. it's just that...  answer the question, president washington.  yes.  yes, it's true. i farted.  i smelt it and it was i who dealt it.   i rest my case.  one vote for washington. one vote for robin.  it's a tie. what.  you guys didn't vote.  no. of course not. i'm not into politics.  then how shall we break the tie.  there's only one way to settle this, washington.  both: fisticuffs.  and the winner will lead the titans.  robin, you can't fight george washington.  yeah, you leave that sweet, old woman alone.  not a chance.    i've cut down more than cherry trees with this ax, child.  by the power of america.   i have the power.     freedom shield.  money grandma ain't messing around, yo.  liberty punch.      monument bash.   do you yield.   i yield.  good lad.  are you the okay, robin.  i see now i was wrong.  i wanted to win this election so badly i forgot what being a true leader really means.  so, effective immediately, george washington is the leader of the teen titans.  robin: sorry, guys.  i'm sorry you won't be around to see me become the greatest leader ever.  robin, what are you doing.  you can read about it in the history books.   guys, look.  he didn't. he did.  man: after defeatingthe british with hissweet kung fu moves, robin becamethe first presidentof the united states.  was this also a part of the plan, raven.  more or less.  wow.  that's from the frootozoic era.  awesome.  a fantastic froot loopy find.  mmm...those are my froot loops,ya dig.  let's ditch this dino, boys.  this way.  oh my.
