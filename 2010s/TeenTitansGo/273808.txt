  hey. what's going on here.  we heard some cool music playing so we came outside and found these cool guys.  and they are the coolest.  super cool.  this is our leader, robin.  you don't look like no robin to me, mate.   wait... what.  are you mocking me.  oh. you're the mockingbirds i kicked out of the chimney.  that's right.  why would you kick 'em out. they're really cool.  when i kicked them out they weren't this cool.  the chemicals i used must have mutated them.  i noticed you have laser eyes.  just so happens i do too.     oh, what's wrong, mr. redbreast.  can't you fly.    the hawk.    the canadian goose.   you bird call like a pro, mate.  how about a robin.  oi, everybody, i'm the leader.  me name's robin but me ain't got no feathers.   why are you encouraging these guys.  they're just filthy birds.  i think they are sweet.   . oh, yeah .  mockingbirds are nothing but trouble.  these guys. yeah, right.   . yeah .   ah. my room.  what have you done.  you thought you was oh, so clever.  chucking us out of the chimney.  well, mate, we're taking over your nest now.  but it's my room.  oi, he's disrespecting us, brother.  can't have that. too right.  stamping time.  stop. my eye. ahh.  ahh. ooh. me eye.       well, have fun with your birdy friends.  i'm leaving.  did he say something. oh.  forget about him. now we can have some real fun.  excellent notion, brother.  i think it's time for a...  bird party.   . i'm free as a bird .  so i said, "let's shake a tail feather, baby." she's all like, "yeah." and i'm like, "what." . i'm free as a bird .  hey, baby, what's shaking. how you doing.  nice beak.   man, these bird girls are cold.  i told you to back off.  my name is raven. i am not "a" raven.   come on, guys. gimme a break.   look, everybody. garbage.  . i'm free as a bird . the bird, the bird, the bird .    ahh.  eew.  bird dookie.    the feathers are everywhere.  oi, can we help it if we're molting.   is that an egg sandwich.  yeah.  maybe.   what happened.   he used to be cool.   another nature documentary.  you shut your scone hole.    raven: chimney's blocked again.  who shall remove the blockage this time.  i no longer like these birds who mock.  they are bossy and mean.  robin was right about them.  okay, let's see what kind of trash is blocking this thing.   robin.   who are you. robin, it's us.  you.  you were right, dude.  those birds are the worst.  you have to help us get rid of them.  help you, help you, help you. why. why should i help you.  not help us, man.  you gotta lead us.  titans, go.  oh, i thought we got rid of you.  you got it backwards, friend.  oh, you're getting rid of us.  oh, you're getting rid of us.  are you mocking us.  get 'em.       birds of a feather, fight together.  sonic...  these guys just won't go.  how did you ever remove them from the chimney the first time.  birdy cide.     uhoh. they mutated again.  we have not mutated.  rather, we have evolved into the birds of the future.  with our newly advanced intellects has come an understanding of the futility of conflict.  you have nothing to fear from us, titans.  we have foresworn acts of disgusting violence.  and desire only to live in peace.  uh...  okay.  in that case...   filthy mockingbirds.   not on the brain, not on the brain.  uncivilized.  ai. that was me bum.  filthy mockingbirds.    what did you do to her, raven.  banished her to another dimension.  you're welcome.   let me out of here.  you can't do this to me.   where is that trashcoming from.   i hate this place.  sooner or later, i'll get out of here.  and when i do,i'm coming to have my revenge, titans.  and i'm saving you for last, beast boy.  chili. really.  stop droppingfood on me.  hey, rave,why is your trash hole always yelling.  you remember

been waiting for this moment.  me too.  hey, will you be my valentine.  you really think...  i mean, i have something for you too.  something very special.  but you'll have to wait for it, valentine.  if it's what i think it is, i don't mind waiting.   wow.   ooh.  look who is paying us the valentine's day visit.  oh, how cute, star.  you're really getting into...  ow. it's shooting me.  ah, it's shooting me.  whose baby is that.  it is not a baby.  it is the cupid.   guys, guys, guess what.  terra's back in town and she says she'll be my valentine.  oh, that's what i'm talking about, son.  that's what's up.  get on with your bad self.  just so you know, i didn't tell him terra was in the trash hole.  this is terrible.  yeah, terrible for you, rave.  yeah, your man's off the market, girl.  you snooze, you lose.   i better keep an eye on her.   hey, terra.  how did you find me.  i'd go to the ends of the earth to find my true love.   so we're having a dance tonight where we tell our valentines how we feel.  everybody's gonna be there.  all the titans in one place.  sounds perfect.  i'll be there. you're perfect.  and cool.  uh, are you trying to break into this place.  you know that thing i'm making for you.  something i need for it is in there.  why didn't you say so.   come on in.  there you are, valentine.  argh, no more arrows.  no, no.  i merely wish to exchange the heart's proclaiming messages of love.  candy hearts. oh, okay. that sounds harmless.   where did you get this heart.  that is of no importance, robin.  did it just move.  i am sorry, but i could not carve a message into it.  yo, rave, guess what.  terra's making me a special valentine's surprise and from the looks of it, it's gonna be big, shiny or probably radioactive.  she doesn't like you, beast boy.  she's planning on destroying us all.  hmm. sounds like someone's bummed she's not gonna get to slow dance with me tonight.  argh, here, look.  i've been using my magic to watch her every move.  my little gift to beast boy.  the power amplifier is finally complete.  man, you just ruined my surprise.  shh.  now, he'll learn just how much i care for him.  see. terra: care to crush him.  she doesn't really mean that.  terra: i hate beast boy.   what a jokester she is.  terra: hate. she gets grumpy when she hasn't eaten.  terra: hate, hate, hate, hate, hate.   i tried to warn you.  you okay.  what's wrong with me.  there is nothing wrong with you.  it's her. she's an awful person.  no, there's a good side to her, rave.  i know it. i'm just not good enough for her.  you know, there's another girl out there who i bet likes you.  if she's out there, why hasn't she told me.   may i have this dance.  what's the matter with you. step away from the prisoner.  i have one last valentine's gift for you, robin.  oh, no, please don't. i can't...  now is the time we share how we feel about our valentines.  robin, you are like the brother to me.  and, jinx, i just wanted to...  ow. ow. she's all tied up.  why.  step away from the prisoner.   i don't have a valentine to share my feelings with.  i have something to share.  beast boy...  sorry, raven, but i'd like to share my feelings
