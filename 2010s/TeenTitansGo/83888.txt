   the iles too.  meow, meow, meow.  meow, meow. meow, meow, meow.  meow, meow, meow.  meow, meow. meow, meow, meow.  meow, meow, meow. okay, stop.  it's not happening.  i hate being the only titan who cannot do the joke.  aw, don't feel bad, star.  ot.  you tell uncle jokes.  robin has never told a joke about his uncle.   uncle jokes aren't about uncles.  they're just lame jokes that someone like an uncle would tell.  and they're never ever funny.  i don't tell uncle jokes.  really.  how do you want your steak cooked.  on a stove.  boom.  man, i'm hungry.  oh, nice to meet you hungry.  i'm robin.  boom.  hey beast boy, why can't you hear a pterodactyl going to the bathroom.  because the 'p' is silent.  boom.  boom. boom. boom.  please stop. i assure you i understand the concept now.   the 'p' is silent.  i just got it.  raven likes my jokes.  dude, your jokes are so uncley, we ought to call you uncle.  yeah, that's right, uncle.  both: uncle, uncle, uncle.  blah.   your humor is quite masterful.  perhaps if i joined your company, i could learn from you.  no way.  this here. this is a twosome.  not one. not three.  dos. two.  got it.  our broship is like a horst and graben structure.  or a noble gas, whose outer atomic shell can neither take in or release anymore electrons.  so it is final. i cannot learn the jokes from you.  under no circumstances, lady.  never ever.  you have made yourselves clear.  i will remain unfunny.  whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. wait.  this is where you're supposed to say something like, "you'll make cookies." and then we say, "okay." it's called a comedy turn.  now let's try it again.    you never gonna be part of our group, starfire.  never ever.  but what if i could make of the cookies.   both: you're in.       there are so many possibilities for my comedic catchphrase.  i was thinking something like, "boo, ha, ha." uh, we're digging the transformation, star, but you really shouldn't try to talk like us.  yeah, "booyah" is well, how about this.  i am the cool shamma lamma mumu.   needs work.  so, i was just wondering, what do you call a cow with no legs.  ground beef.  boom.   boom. not bad, uncle.  stop calling me that.  stop not being funny.   you guys are a terrible influence on her.  so what.  so, we all have very specific roles in the titans.  i'm the lone wolf leader.  you two are the goodnatured slackers.  raven's the sarcastic older sister.  and you're my unrequited love.  when you hang out with them, our whole universe is thrown out of balance.  you have to go back to normal.  you are absolutely right, uncle.   i can't take it. ah, she just uncled you. you got took to uncle school.    . she called you uncle 'causeyour jokes are lame . and you're far from funny,it's a crying shame . when you hear them crickets,you're the one to blame .   . ha ha ha how . it is not the cool if you ask me . you're acting likea glibnort, do you see.  . it's the 'u' to the 'n',the cle . uncle jokes are badfor you and me . you know them uncle jokesare just not fun . them uncle jokesare just not fun . them uncle jokesare just not fun . don't tell themuncle jokes no more .  you heard that one he told yesterday. oh, man. that was horrible.  . don't . don't tell themuncle jokes no more .  man, those uncle jokes are crunchy.  do you know what just happened there, star.  what.  we just became a comedy trio.  i thought nothing could be more perfect than a twosome, but i was wrong.  we are the three legs of an equilateral triangle.  we're tofu, lettuce, and tomato.  we are the three stomachs of a glorg that allow it to digest a zardic without chewing.  aw, yeah. that's what i'm talking 'bout.  balance.  you okay.  balance will be restored. it has to be restored.  dude, you should just chillax. booyah.  yeah, bro. have a sandwich.  tofu rules.  i have never kissed a lone wolf leader before.  and i regret it.  shut up, everybody. i'm trying to read.  uh, what's going on.  robin can't function with the team's balance out of whack.  so his body is genetically mutating in order to restore it.  or something like that.  oh, and shut up, everybody. i'm trying to read.   is that the crime alarm.      oh no, the garden's under attack.  titans go.  man, just once i'd like to say, "titan's go." come on, hurry up.  can we pick up some pizza on the way.  no time for pizza.  we've got to focus on the mission.  this elevator is so crowded, might i stand a little closer.  robin.   aw, shucks, starfire.  we're surrounded.  cyborg, take out the left flank.  yes, sir.  starfire, provide covering fire.  okay, handsome lone wolf leader.  go. go. go.  booyah.  zap. bzzzap.  azarath metrion zinthos.  oh, man. he's attacking the garden g ur comedy trio.  we have no choice.  we're gonna have to kick starfire out of our comedy trio, and become whatever you'd call a duo of comedians.  a comedy duo.  bingo.  beast boy, turn into some animals.     ha, ha.  look at robin, he's so cracra for the realreal.  not for the playplay.  shamma lamma mumu.   shamma lamma mumu.   nice one, uncle.  excuse me.  yeah, nice one, uncle.  are you uncleing me.   make an uncle joke and suffer the consequences, uncle.  but... don't you get it. we all have our roles.  we're the goodnatured slackers.  not you.  i believe i get it.  but i will need the comforting from the lone wolf leader.  did someone say, "lone wolf." oh, please, give me the comforting, lone wolf.   there, there. you're home now, star. you're home.  so brutal, bro. so brutal.  we had to do it.  we had to let her go.  i know.  hopefully it's enough to make robin normal again.  hey, beast boy, is your face hurting you.
