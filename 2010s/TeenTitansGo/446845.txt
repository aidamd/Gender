i say no.  he's a onetrick pony.   and there's no place on the titans for onetrick ponies.  you're right, robin. speed is my only power.  hat from russia.  but it's a pretty cool power.  anybody can run that fast.  uh, you couldn't. yeah.  if i'm a onetrick pony, then that makes you a notrick pony.  i am a multipletrick pony.  a master of sweet ninja moves.   a natural born leader.  titans, follow my train of thought here.  and after that...   a detective. hmm.  mmm. hmm.  i possess... the tightest butt cheeks of any titan.  ooh.  and, i'm a master beat boxer.   look, you may be good at a lot of things, but you still couldn't beat me in a race.  i believe i could.  and if i win, you have to stop running. forever.  and if you win, you get to lead the titans.   well then, let's do it. fine.  give me one week.  i'm going to need to train.  robin: yeah. come on. you can do it. you can do anything.  i believe in you.  this is the training.  yes. training so hard now.  i believe. this is the face of the fastest man alive.  that's not gonna make you faster.  oh, yeah. check this out.   whoa. i didn't even see my hand go by.  shouldn't you actually, like, be running or something.  kid flash has the power of super speed, bruh.  but, but, but. i have the ultimate power.  i believe in myself.  believing in yourself isn't a power.  of course it is, my underdeveloped underlings.  robin: you see,by believing in what we want, we send mindwavesinto outer space, where it comes trueand is sent back to us.  it's simple science.  beast boy. how many burritos can you eat in one day.  hmm. my tummy gets angry at about 20.  believe in yourself, anyou can triple that.   raven, if you would just believe in yourself, you could fly. i can fly.  now you're getting it.  cyborg. you don't think you can pull off a fedora, do you.  of course not. my head's the wrong shape.   believe.  whoa.  lookin' good, brah.  i believe i am.  star. believe in yourself.  and you too can achieve your dreams.  ooh.   is the believing in oneself truly a superpower.  if you... believe.  you don't stand a chance, kid flash.   yeah. you may be fast, but robin believes in himself.  hope you brought an appetite, 'cos you're about to eat some dust.   on your mark.  may the fastest man win.  i plan to.  get set.    believe, believe. believe, believe, believe.   believe. what.  i believe i won.  yeah, but my cape was slowing me down. rematch.  sure.  believe.  three out of five.   ha. it's a tie. i won.  actually, according to the photo finish, kid flash won.  kid flash. won.  several times.  don't worry. i still believe.  in our new leader.   starfire:.. raven: i knew you could do it...  beast boy: gosh, you're gonna be... i guess i'll, uh...  see you guys around.    ah, what's the point in moving.  i'll just be slower than kid flash anyway.  heyya, handsome, why so down.  if believing in myself isn't a real power, then i'm the worst of all ponies.  i'm a notrick pony.  what are you talking about.  you're the trickiest pony out there.  stop trying to cheer me up.  i'm just a slow, notrick pony with flabby butt cheeks.  so, some guy is faster than you, you're better than him at so many other things.  and it wasn't because you believed in yourself, it was because you worked hard.  so... my ninja moves are still sweet.  super sweet.  and i'm a master beatboxer.  yeah, you're not bad.  and my butt cheeks.  the tightest. mmmhmm.  it would take years for kid flash to master all your tricks.  i reckon you got the juice, kid.  you're right. i may have lost, but i am still a multipletrick pony.    hey, robin. what are you doing here.  i've come to take back the titans.  actually, we kinda like kid flash as our leader.  but he's a onetrick pony.  he can't do half the stuff i can do.  oh, excuse me.  had to save a norwegian family from drowning.   whoops. sorry, one sec.  disarmed a doomsday device.  cyborg: you are so cool.  beast boy: marry me.   all right, onetrick, you may be fast, and cool, and allaround amazing, but can you... beatbox like this.   back to you.   starting again.  both fingers your way.  but... that's impossible.  what you're doing takes years of training.  usually, usually.  but thanks to believing in myself, and super speed, it only took three minutes.  now, not only can i beatbox, but check out my sweet ninja moves.   and these butt cheeks.  'cause they're tight.   all right.  you win. the titans are yours.  on one condition.  a condition.  i'm better than you at everything now.  not everything.  you can lead the titans if you beat me in a...  foot race.  what.  isn't you losing a race to this guy how this all started.  this time is going to be different.  this time i'm believing in myself more than i ever have before.  okay. i thought we established that didn't work.  cyborg: on your mark.  get set.  yeah, kid flash.  he is so dreamy.   believe.  ow. ow. ow.  oh, did i hear something rip.  look at him go.   he's doing it.  he's... he's really doing it.   believe.   i believe.  ow. ow. ow.  i need ice. it's swelling.  some people are married to the idea that fresh salads can only come from salad places with fancy bowls.  so, do i believe wendy's can make a summer salad this fresh.  i do.  this summer,try the strawberry fields salad.  from wendy's.  battle, you need powerful protection.  new right guard xtreme heat shield.  .  ...tested to the extreme.  proven to perform.  right guard. for the win.  serious consideration i'd like to put in my 15year notice.  you're quitting..  technically retiring, sir.  with a little help from my state farm agent, i plan to retire in 15 years.  wow. you're totally blindsiding me here.  who's gonna manage your accounts.  this is a devastating blow i was not prepared for.  well, i'm gonna finish packing my things.  15 years will really sneak up on you.  jennifer with do your exit interview and adam made you a cake.  red velvet.  oh, thank you.  i made this.  take charge of your retirement.  talk to a state farm agenttoday.  go.    . teen titans, let's go .  .  tteen, tteeteen .  .  titans, do you knowwhat day it is.  all: wednesday.  hump day, baby.  oh, yeah. nothing betterthan the middle of the week.  hoohoohoo.hoohoohoo. humphump.   wednesday.  uh, first of all, it's friday.  all: friday.  enough. yes, it's friday.  but more importantly,it's payday.  why can it not be the wednesday.  woohoohoo. loopoopoo.  humphump.  so, what are you going to spend this money on.  i could really use a new robot badonkadonk.  ooh, i also wish to purchase the new robot badonkadonk.  books, books, books and some books and books.  books.   wrong.  wrong.  wrong, wrong, wrong and some wrong.  wrong.  money is not to be wasted on things that bring you happiness and joy.  money is to be hoarded, until your have enough money that your money makes more money.  and then you spend that money.  no. you hoard that money, too.  ew. this is why they say money is the root of all evil.  money. evil.  i know someone who might change your mind about that.  oh, well hi there. i am money.   hi, money. nice to meet you.  now, did someone here think i am evil.  it is him. the green one.  you are evil, bro. i know your heart.  money doesn't have a heart, beast boy.  exactly. he's evil.  watch your mouth or i'll break your bones.   what i mean is, how can i be evil when i'm just a little old piece of paper.   you're not paper, you're money.  silly, money.  i am paper, but i am also money.  all i am is an agreed uponrepresentative of credit.  something you tradefor goods and services. )
