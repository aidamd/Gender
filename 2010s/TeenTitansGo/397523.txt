 ouble. we need to go.  please proceed. i will join you shortly.      when a hungry tummyshakes your world ..  a lunchablesturkey and cheddar sub.  bread made with whole grain.  now with applesauceand spring water.  lunchables.  lunch your tummy right.   charms, mmm...   did you see that.  whoa wait.  over there.  what.  whoa, ahh where'd he go, what's happening.  wahoo, wow, whoa with these new swirled charms, i can teleport get him.  whoa, where'd he go.  new swirledlucky charms, part of a completebreakfast.  discover the magicallydelicious power...  of telaporting.   is that a sewer pipe.  ew.  i don't know what's more disgusting, plasmusthe way you look or the stuff you eat.  titans, go.  come on, booger man. give me what you got.  i'm gonna be smelling that for a week.   azarath metrion.  ..  yuck.  cyborg, time for the beast boy blitz.  aah. oh.  oh.  orangeflavored bad guy.  .. yet strangely refreshing.  booyah. awesome.  ..fire.  interesting fashion statement.  yeah. er, uh, nice slicker.  starfire, you've been acting kind of strange lately.  is everything ok.  ..   ew.  just when you thought he couldn't get uglier.  that is sick, and not in the good way.  no matter how nasty he gets, he's just a monster, and like every other monster, he's got to go.  oh.  duck.   starfire.  ew.    starfire, what's goingi am sorry. i have got to go.  starfire. wait.   i truly am a monster.  and so the sad, strange girl flew far away into the cold, dark loneliness of outer space.  "surely," thought the odd little alien, "a horrible, ugly monster like me does not belong on earth with such good and handsome friends," but where was she to go.  not even her home planet would take her in looking as strange as she did.  "i must find a new world," she decided, "one with monsters as horrible and ugly as " hello, fellow ugly monsters.    aaaah.   gonk. gonk.   but with each new world she visited, the strange alien girl felt uglier and uglier, and with nowhere else to go, she wandered alone ..  but she was not really alone.  cyborg, how long until we can launch.  oh, about 5 minutes after you quit asking me that.   are we sure this thing is ready to fly.  the tsub was built for deep sea, not deep space.  it's going into space.  main power on line.  defensive systems active.  oxygen tanks at maximum.  fusion thrusters ready to fire.  titans, launch.  told you she was ready to fly.  hmm.   hello. someone is there.  your planet is most inhospitable.  i would perhaps be welcomed here.   oh.  aah.  aah.  let go now, please.  uh. uh. no.   oh, what is happening to me.  something wonderful.   please, i am too repellent to be seen by one so glorious.  there is nothing wrong with you.  nothing wrong.  come. all will be made clear shortly.  and with hope in her heart, the strange little alien followed the mysterious woman to the strangest place she had ever seen.  you are changing. do you know why.  it is because i have a zit.  heh. not quite, my dear.  you're experiencing the transformation, a perfectly normal part of the tamaranian life cycle.  but i do not understand.  when my sister had transformation, she merely turned purple for two days.  why have itransformation is different for each tamaranian, and you, sweet child, are one of the special few who will transform into a chrysalis.   uh. uh.  relax, dear. it will all be over soon.  uh. ugh.  how do you know these things.  ..  am a cyramillian chrysalis eater.    aaaaaah.  ok. so we know she's not there.  phew.  wherever starfire is, i just hope she's all right.  uh. ooh. uh. uh. uh.  aaah.   wonderful.  aah.  soon, your cocoon will be complete, and you, my dear, will be at the peak of flavor.  in the meantime, please scream all you wish.  it whets my appetite.  i have no reason to scream.  i can no longer have a home or friends.  i am far too ugly for such things.  oh, i don't think you're ugly at all, my dear.   aah. aaaah.  in fact, you look good enough to eat.  haaaargh.  starfire.  get starfire out of here.  where'sum, in here.  ahh.  whoa.  your friend belongs to me now.  you can have her back once i finish digesting her.  i think it's time we wrapped this up.  starfire, are you ok.  starfire, can you hear me.   hang on. i'm going to get you out.   no. please go.  you will not wish to see me this way.  i don't care how you look.  besides, you look fine to me.   ..normal...  mostly.  since you have stolen my meal, i shall devour you instead.  devour this.  aaah.    dude. since when can your eyes do that.  since just now.  please do not reject me. i am almost normal.  you're exactly as you should be.  no matter how you change on the outside, you'll always be starfire on the inside.  so the happy young girl returned home with her friends, and they all lived happily ever after.  that is, until beast boy got the chicken pox.   roup captioned by the nationalcaptioning institute www.ncicap.org..

to a guy: jump on him, stick him with a pin.  the only limit is your imagination.  don't they have any girl wrestlers in this game.  no, but some of the older ones have breasts.  that was your mother on the phone.  she's making sure you were doing homework.  am i in trouble.  i don't think so.  i told her you were busy wrestling with some word problems.   ..  thanks, mrs. hill.  i guess i better

well, that's a fumble, isn't it.  ..  no bouncing at all.  ..  that's a mandatory drug test right there.  so, join the basketball team.  thank you.  cool.  a little staged, but it's still pretty good.  gentlemen, i'm not going to try to win you over with a lot of fancy talk about bouncing.  i just want you to know one thing: every kid who shows up to wrestle will earn a place on the team and the right to wear this.  wow. silver piping.  good morning, class.  peggy hill or "coach" hill.  now, we are offering you girls a special program which combines the thrills of wrestling with the skills of basketball in something we call, " all right, listen up.  go on.  i want to start by showing you a basic move and i need a volunteer.  you there just come at me.   that's called a "centerstep, " now what are you going to do, huh.  .  you gonna dump me.  you going to pin me.  this'll teach you to pull a knife on me.  hard to stab a guy when you're hopping around, huh, hoppy.  ...  all right. good job.  .. )
