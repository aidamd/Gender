real, right.  not real. the woman almost ate my soul.  why is this so hard to believe. raven's father is a demon.  yeah, but he doesn't waste his time hanging out at little kids' sleepovers.  unless he's, you know, super bored.  maybe we can help you get over your stupid, shameful and completely unjustified fear.  how. what if we held the party of slumber tonight.  all: slumber party.   you wear that to bed.   just part of my never ending war on crooked teeth.  i shall never surrender.  so now we just go to sleep.  no way, dude. sleepovers aren't about sleeping.  they're about all the awesome stuff you do instead of sleeping.   first up, building the world's best blanket fort according to these very detailed blueprints i made.  we'll start with laying the foundation.  then, in two hours, when that's done, we can...   raven: really.  oh, come on. it's not that complicated.  once the primary support column is up...  i'll do it myself.  hey, cyborg, know the best part about slumber parties.  pillow fight. yah.      raven, help. i'm under attack.  no, thanks. raven, come on.  i'm not playing.  aw, please, mama.  it won't be fun if you don't play.  fight of the pillow.  all:  fight of the pillow. fight of the pillow.  fine.    there, happy.  ooh, ooh, titans, i know an activity to take cyborg's mind off of his fear.  the game of candor or audacious undertaking.  you mean truth or dare.  all: oh.   who knows what crazy things i might do if given the dare.  i dare you to kiss... no, i dare you to date me for a few years.  and then move in with me, and then, one night, when the moon is full, to watch me bend down on one knee...  and to name our third child cecilia, after my favorite aunt.  and then hold my hand as the sun goes down over the mountains and whisper in my ear, "it has been the good life." that is your dare. i was going to pick the truth.  oh. would you do all that stuff.  no.  i see.  i'll be in the blanket fort.    why, robin. why.  you had to put it all out there. stupid.  stupid.  she thinks you're a jerk. why doesn't she love me.  my teeth are straight. they're so straight.   not to mention my awesome hair and i've shown loving father skills to silkie.  okey dokey...  oh, i got a good dare.    whoo. that was awesome.   that's what i'm talking about, brah.  are you feeling better about the nighttime.  you know what. i think i am.  i'm glad you decided to stop acting like a big dumb baby.  well, good night.  is everybody okay. i'm pretty sure i heard scary teri.  okay, i think there's only one way to fix this.  wait, what are you...
