 greetings, jinx.  my least favorite titans.  here to gloat again about putting me in prison.  again.  yeah, i do that when i'm bored sometimes.   look at you. you're in prison.  i hate you.  we're here to invite you out on a crazy night on the town.  i hope i said crazy with enough of the crazy.  excuse me.  as an expert of the criminal brand of crazy and also a female, you can be a great resource for us.  hold on, crazy. we're not here to break her out of jail, are we.  of course not.  we're merely borrowing her.  just imagine all the fun you will have.  oh, please, oh, please. say you will join us.  not like i have better plans.  oh, i have the joy.  no.   of course, if you try to escape, i will obliterate you into microscopic particles.  sounds like a blast. yes.  eye blast. that is how i will obliterate you.  according to the commercial advertisements, this will be the perfect place for our girls night to commence.  oh. wacka. wacka. wacka. welcome to wacka doodles.   the funnest place in the galaxy.   oh, this is indeed the crazy.  you really do need my help, don't you.   oh. oh.  i just wanted to watch a movie by myself.  wait. are you thinking what i'm thinking.  i know i'm thinking what you're thinking.  whoa, whoa, whoa. there is no way you could be thinking what i am thinking.  it's just too crazy.  all: hat party.  woman: hats.  oh, no. the long lines will prevent any of the fun.  well, we could just go home.  you are such a drip.  there's free kittens in the parking lot.   both: free kittens.   look. no more lines.  wow. you really know how to bring the fun.  she does indeed.  i wish to ride the cars that bump into each other.  the boys were correct about me lacking enough of the crazy.  you just need a little guidance.  if you let me out, i might be able to help.  yeah, right. there is no way in a million years we're letting you out of that...  there you go.  just remember what i said about obliterating you.  yeah. eye beams. got it.  now let's get crazy.  follow me.    and we're all going to jail.  will you try to have fun.     can we please pull over.  no way, mom.  yeah. no way, mom.  wee.   wee.  oh. first time i ever rode a building.   all: crazy fries. crazy fries.  crazy fries. crazy fries.  crazy fries. crazy fries.  those fries are absolutely insane.    guys. crazy idea.  what if we eat the crazy fries in crazy ways.  narrator:crazy fry chowdown. go.  crazy.  fry fist.  crazy catch.  potato slam.  mega fry.    yep.  these were some crazy fries.  crazy, man. crazy.   what.  i was just thinking about the look on your face when the cops started chasing us.  yeah. that was pretty...  crazy.  yeah. it was.   and then remember when we rode that building we demolished, as if it were a surf board.  you've got more of the crazy than even me, starfire.  tonight was fun.  definitely the most i've had since being locked up.  then who says the fun cannot continue.   best boys night ever.   i bet the girls stayed home and watched movies with vampires that kiss all the time.    oh, hello, boys.  police officer: we have you surrounded.  we must go.  bye.  nice try, ladies, but...  ...lame.     this is mixed up.  mix up your favoritefoods with lunchables with 100% juice kabobbles.          incoming.  yea..      capri sun. push play.  .  .  .    haahaaaaaaa.  it's time to join the action and soak up the fun.  with a nerf or nerfrebelle brand toy and the goodness ofgogurt strawberry yogurt in your mcdonald's happy meal.  we've got to stop plasmus before he destroys this planet.  titans, go.  hmm. what to turn into. what to turn into.  this is not the time for style, beast boy.  hold your horses.  hmm. a horse.  nah. too obvious now.   what about a pterodactyl.  a pterodactyl would be great right now.  i was a pterodactyl last week.   come on, beasty.  turn into something. ah.  i know. i'm gonna save the day as a...  huh. huh. i'm a llama.  pretty fresh, right.    beast boy.  yes.  what's going on. who's the lady.  this is gayle, from human resources.  we have human resources.  there's no easy way to say this, but your employment with the teen titans is officially terminated.  what. you're joking.  tell me you're joking.  right, guys.  gayle.  whoa, whoa, whoa. is this about that planet blowing up.  okay. i messed up.  but everyone messes up from time to time.  to time, to time. to time. to time.  to time. to time.  and lately, you've seemed to have forgotten what being a hero is all about.  no fair. i never knew what it was about in the first place.   okay, then. i guess this is goodbye.  yep. sure.  goodbye.  adios, champ.  okay. guess we need a new titan.  one that has animal super powers.  and preferably doesn't drink straight from the milk carton.  ew.  vixon.  that's a nice name.  uh, says here, you can mimic the abilities of nearby animals.  so what. you makebird sounds or something.  tweet, tweet.next.  cyborg, be cool.  excuse him, vixon.  he's not happywith our recent personnel changes.    let's see what you got, vixon.    cyborg:  lame.  so lame.    that was so lame.  lamey, lamey, lamey.   boo.  boo.  sorry, cyborg, but it looks like we've found our newest titan.    i'm not living with her.  robin: next.  nice to meet you, b'wana beast.  cyborg: b'wana beast.   i bet you b'wanna new name.  cyborg. if you b'wanna some pants i could get you some.  enough. but i b'wanna...  cyborg.  okay.  why don't you demonstrate your powers for us.  must you use the silky for the demonstration.  i'm sure it's perfectly safe, star.    oh. that's not right.  robin: next.  yes. my name is detective chimp.  both: next.  my name is beast babe.  next.  worth a try.  jayna: excuse us.  we're the wonder twins.  we heard you're holding auditions today.  we are like such huge fans. you have no idea.  great. show us what you got.  both: wonder twin powers, activate.  shape of tiger.   that tiger is awesome.  form of water.  that tiger is awesome.  i also transform into ice and gas.   good news. jayna, you're hired. yes.  zan, we decided to go another way.   wait. we need each other to activate our powers.  so, it's either all or nothing with us.  that could be a problem.   good news. a position just opened up.  as our receptionist.   titans tower. zan speaking.  no. he doesn't work here.  you want the bat cave.  i'm sorry. i'm not at liberty to give that number out.    hey, jayna. how's the new job.  no time to talk. we're in the middle of a battle.  just need to activate my powers.  oh, right.  both: wonder twin powers, activate.  shape of kangaroo.  form of receptionist.   titans tower. zan speaking.  no. you want the bat cave.  bat cave.  thanks for coming, cyborg.  means a lot to me.  hey, even though you're no longer a titan, we can still have lunch, right.  and of course, by "have lunch" you mean plot to get my old job back.  no. i mean have lunch.   so, she's terrible, right. jayna.  no way. she's funny, knows how to cook, great in the garage.  plus, i never knew how much i loved a woman with some pointy ears.  ugh. what a real nightmare.  i bet she's a terrible hero, too. huh.  when she turns into animals she's not green so we can use her powers in a lot more ways than we ever could with you.  to be frank, i never realized what a drag on the team you were until now.  so, if i'm reading between the lines correctly, you're saying, the best way to get my job back is to sabotage her.  i love it.  i think you're misunderstanding me. can you pass the fries.  i said fries.  exactly.  zan, my man.  beast boy. what are you doing here.  i'm here to help.  we gonna get your sister fired.   i do hate this job.  but i could never do that.  well, if that's how you want things to be.  my soda could use some ice.  do you mind.  let's do it.  zan, emergency. need to activate our powers.  zan.  never mind.  from now on you are not leaving my side.  titans, quick. there's trouble on the other side of town.  we'll need to act fast.  both: wonder twin powers, activate.  shape of...  sloth.  sloth.  wait... for... me.   never mind.   both: wonder twin powers, activate.  shape of rhino.   form of ice.   all: never mind.   hey, everyone.  the beast is back.  what are you doing here.  figured you guys might be in the need of my heroic services.  nah, we're good.  but what about her messing up all the time.  the useless wonder twin confessed you were behind it all.  hey. who says zan has no use. not my dogs.  that's it. i quit.  hey. what about my dogs.  where are you going, zan. zan.   i can't be a receptionist any longer.  i'm great at one thing and that's being water.  that's why i've decided to join the ocean.   deep.  this is terrible.  yeah, he left the seat up.  we have to stop him before he floats to sea or we'll never find him.  how. without zan, i can't transform into a fish to swim after him.  but i can.  yep.  well, what are you waiting for.  got to figure out what to turn into.  octopus.  hmm. alligator.  have you learned nothing, man.  nope. but it doesn't make me any less of a hero.  flush me.  and a lifelong dream finally comes true.  you can't stop me.  there's nothing to grab.  oh, yeah.   got you.  hey.  you tickle in there. ah.   stop it. ah.  you know, beast boy, you're not perfect but today you reminded us you truly are a hero.  farewell, wondrous twins.  both: wonder twin powers, activate.  shape of octopus.  form of iceunicycle.    since i'm a hero again, does that mean i can have my old job back.  we have something else in mind for you, big guy.   yes.
