like nonmeat.  of course we don't. we're just being nice to beast boy.  so you're lying to him.  that's not nice.  oh, but i do love the vegetarian chili.  ugh. if you love it so much, why don't you marry it.  marry the chili.  i do love it the so much.  and i could see us building the life and growing old together.  what a happy, happy life we will have together, dear chili...  oh, great. now i have to be the mean one and explain to her why she can't marry a pot of chili.  man, i am superexcited about star's wedding.  it's just so nice when a beautiful woman and a dashing pot of chili find true love.  there's not gonna be a wedding.   did they break up.  no. raven's just being mean again.  phew. so, mama, you wanna be my date.  i am not going to a chili wedding.  would you come if starfire was marrying a chickenparmesana sandwich.  no.  what if starfire married some soup. no.  rice and beans. you guys are starting to annoy me.  hot dogs. last warning.  corn on la cob.    hello, hello, hello.  ugh. my day just keeps getting better.  what do you want, dad.  i sensed you causing great pain and suffering to your friends and thought, "hey, maybe you're finally ready to devour their souls, "and join me in the destruction of this pitiful world." nope.  why don't you want to destroy anything with your father anymore.  because i'm a nice person.  you. nice.   wait, wait, wait...  i'm sorry, raven, but you are mean.  it's the half demon in you.  maybe i'm not nice, but i'm not mean either.  i'm "nean." "nean".   are we just making up words now.  i can do that too.  look, i'm a real bluzo kind of guy.  "nean" is being nice by being mean.  i tell it like it is when people are acting ridiculous.  that's dumb. stop it.  everybody needs a "nean" person in their life.  and i'm the neanest.  you're being such a norblem right now.  oh, i'm sorry. i thought we were still making up fake words.  see, now you're being mean.  exactly.  and you should be too.  but if you don't want to, so be it.  something tells me you're about to have a nice day, raven.   what's so funny.  i made a pun that will make sense to you later.  maybe we'll share a "nice" laugh about it.   hey, what time is it.   i cannot. i'm in a committed nonmeat relationship.  nonmeat will upset my belly.  i really just want to know what time it is.   and i know, raven doesn't want any.  i want nonmeat.  you do. i do.  if you say so, mama.  mmm... keep that nonmeat comin'.  participating in one of beast boy's inane activities.  why are you being so nice, raven.  i don't know.  whatever the reason, it means the world to me, mama.  tofu in your face.  uhoh. i know that look, beasty. run.    don't leave me hangin'.  yeah.  beast boy, you so crazy.  what is happening to me.   mmm...   oh. hope i'm not interrupting.  i just wanted to congratulate the chili on his upcoming nuptials.   then i shall give you a moment to do the "broout." well, you won her heart fair and square, my good man.  so you think you can steal starfire from me just by being delicious. do you. huh. huh.  you think you're so hot.  well, let's see how hot you can get.   looks like you're starting to sweat.  what'd you say. come on bro, say it again.  say it to my face.   chili.   oh, it burns.  something strange is happening to me.  when did i start being so nice.   friend raven, do you have a moment.  uh, of course, i do. ugh.  i realize you have the doubts about my engagement, but the chili and i hope you will join us for the wedding.  of course, i won't. it's your wedding, star.  really.  i was having the second thoughts, but if you are so supportive it must be the right thing to do.  as long as you're happy, i'm happy.  wonderful.  oh, the chili will be so happy to hear we have your blessings.  starfire: chili.    so you get my little pun now.  remember. "have a nice day".  i cursed you so you could only be nice.  why.  to force you to make a decision.  be nice or be mean.  no more this "nean" stuff. it's not a word.  thank you for taking an interest in me, but i'll have to get back to you.  very well. before i go, can i get a hug.   oh.  oh. that's a good one.  now, who's the best daddy in the world.  you are. ugh.   i kind of like you this way.   ugh.  what's wrong, robin.   starfire.  i've lost her forever.  that chili is just too awesome.  it's not too late, you know.  you'll help me sabotage the wedding.  you don't need to sabotage anything.  you just need to be yourself.  but that chili is so cool. so are you.  you have so much to offer.  you're right.  i am pretty great.  thanks, raven.  wow. i feel good because i made him feel good.  maybe being nice isn't so bad.  hey, nice face.  thanks.    great magic trick.   aw. cute baby.    thanks for the delicious hot dog.   raven. flowers.  are you actually enjoying yourself.  being nice is nice.  this was the best thing you've ever done for me.  oh, please.  you're only saying that because of a stupid curse i put on you.  no, dad. i don't need your curse to be nice anymore.   this is not what i intended. i must remove the curse.  you'll have to catch me first.     give me that curse.  well, if it's the nice thing to do.    oh, no. a reverse curse.  and i'm back to normal.  now, if you don't mind, i'd appreciate if you'd never bother me again.  of course, honey. you need your space.   i understand completely, booboo kitty.   now, i'm being nice.  how could my plan backfire so badly.  yeah, i would have told you your plan was dumb, but i couldn't because it wouldn't have been nice.  that's why the world needs "nean" people, dad, to keep dumb people from doing dumb things all the time, speaking of which, i need to go.  oh, and dad, have a nice day.      everyone, may i have your attention, please.  i'd like to say a few words.  this chili wedding is super dumb.  there. someone had to say it.   i knew this chili wasn't good enough for you. ha.  i was kind of thinkin' that, but i didn't want to be mean.  me too, brah. me too.  you have ruined the chili wedding, raven.   thank you.  i did not really love the chili.  well, someone had to be the "nean" one.   there, there, chili.  i know it hurts now, but the right girl for you is still out

i did not know that.i didn't know either, brah.  you guys knowit's sports day, right.  no.what are you talking about.  i see.  allow me to bring you allup to speed.  today is sports day.   sports day.  why do i even botherprinting up flyers.  today, we will be playing the world's most popular sport...  futbol.  football. i love football.   i didn't say we're playing"football." uh, pretty sure you did, bro.  uh, no, bro, i said we're playing "futbol." football. i love football.  and he's going to the 50... and he's going to the 40...  no, we are not playing football.  uh, i'm so confused, bro.  we are playing futbol.  also known as soccer.  boooo.  don't nobody care about soccer.  it is the most tedious of athletic events.  it's just people kicking a ball and then pretending to be hurt.  i don't like "sockher" either.  i prefer "sockhim." ow.   you get it. ha. i do get it. that's good.  around the world,futbol ignites the passions of the soul.  it can bring a nation togetheror tear it apart.  most importantly, it is a metaphor for the miracle of life.  are we still talking about soccer.  stop calling it soccer. it's futbol.  you know, i've always thought there was something sinister about the sport.  how can people get so worked up over a ball.  it does seem unlikely a dull game could inspire such intense emotions, robin.  what about that time when cyborg played duck, duck, goose.  the duck, the duck...  the goose.  i am the goose.  the goose.  i'm coming for ya.  no one escapes the goose.  futbol is a beautiful game.  now, say it, and let it live in your hearts.   futbol.  football. no, "futbol." futbol. with passion.  futbol.  that's starting to sound international.  sockhim. beast boy: ow.   i'm hilarious.  great energy. now let's take the field.   we look like the athletics professionals.  uhhuh. oh, yeah. i gots me some shin pads, yo.  kick me as hard as you can. seems like a bad idea.  come on, i won't feel a thing. it's shin armor, brah.  okay.    ow, my shin.  you broke my shin.  i too wish to test the shin armor.    they're not guarding anything.  not a thing.  oh, you guys playing sockhim, too.  cool.     all right, enough horseplay, guys. let's get to the basics.  because no one plays soccer in our country, i've had this ball shipped to us from halfway around the world.  all: ooh.  what a goodlooking ball.  ooh, a collection of pentagons and hexagons forming a sphere.  it's made out of science, yo.  stylish.  it is true. the futbol is the most stylish piece of equipment in all of sports. )
