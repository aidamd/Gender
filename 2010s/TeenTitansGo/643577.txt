 , pizza is of great importance.  yeah, and pizza is the coolest food.  look how cool it makes me.    we can't give up pizza. it's our thing.  it's just bread and cheese in the shape of a circle.  i have no choicebut to institute...  a pizza ban.   pizza van. yeah.  driving in the van,eating pizza is so good.  no, beast boy. he said "pizza ban." oh. like pizza guitars, pizza drums, even cooler.  no.   ban.  oh.  uh, i don't know what that means, actually.  it means no more pizzafrom now on.  all: no.  good pizzafree morning, titans.   what is going on.  do not worry, robin, it is just the mask, you see.  look, we don't mind truth and justice, robin, but we all joined this team for the pizza.  and if we can't eat pizza here then we'll eat with those cool skateboarding turtle dudes.  but you're not turtles, or mutated.  already thought about that, bro.  toxic ooze.     sweet.   awesome.   cool.   now, if you will excuse us, robin, we have the new friends to eat the pizza wit   i was hoping this team was held together by a bond stronger than pizza.  cheese is the strongest bond, bro.  i see that now.  if the titans are going to continue to stay together, i must lift the pizza ban.  whoa. you can lift the pizza van. they're so heavy.  no, we can eat pizza again.   let's make it official. what toppings do you want.  mushroom. pineapple.   plain cheese it is.   hi, i'd like to make an order for a delivery.  uh, what do you mean.  oh, i see.  they're out of pizza.  so. call somewhere else.  you don't get it. everyone's out of pizza.  everyone in the world.   how can that be.  there's only one possible explanation.  turtle dudes.  gah, this is so gross.  well, this is where the cool pizzaeating mutants live.  how can you eat pizza when you're surrounded by all that is filth.   the filth.  let's get this over with.  turtle: what's the password, dude.  just let us in.  password.  totally tubular.  come on in.   what up, titan bros.   so, this is what happened to the world's pizza supply.  but why.  when we told robin about the power of pizza, we were just trying to be cool, youngish, mutated, karate turtle dudes.  but then you guys blew up. you wouldn't stop ordering pizza and there wasn't any left for us.  you know what we had to eat instead.  filth.  no. gross.  we had to eat sandwiches, and sandwiches are not cool.  hey, whoa. sandwiches are super cool.  bottom line, broseph, you took pizza from us, and now, we're taking it back.   sorry.  then that leaves usone option.  titans, go.  guess there's only room for one, goofy, pizzaeating, randomhumor, superhero team, huh.  we may be goofy with goofy random humor, but you're forgetting one thing.  we run around silly and everything.    pow, pow, pow. pow, pow, pow.   dude, their humor is too goofy and random.   they won't stop running around silly and everything.   i was wrong, guys.  i now know truth and justice mean nothing without pizza.  what shall we do with the cool turtle dudes.  i've got a radical idea.  all: cowabunga.  . .  . .  hey there.  hi ronald.  bad day, huh.  i'll say.  well, it could be worse. ooh.  awesome.  . make the gray skies go away .   brighten your day with the goodness of apples and milk.  part of your mcdonald'shappy meal.  . .  death toilet 3 is going to be so good.  so much deathand so many toilets.  remember in death toilet 2,when death toilet rode that flaming motorcycle.   all: so cool.  i have seen noneof the previous toilets of death.  will i even be allowed in.  actually, i don't thinkany of us will be allowed in.  all:  no.  let's just go home.  argh, it's not fair.  who decided we can't see a movie without an adult.  an adult. exactly.  adults think just because they have jobs and a height advantage that they can do whatever they want.  when i'm an adult, i'm not going to be an adult.  oh, you think it's a choice.  when people become adultssomething changes.  they stop being fun,they start worryingabout rules, and they all get boring jobsworking for...  the man.  who is this "the man." no one's ever seen him, but trust me, one day he's coming for all of us.  wow, thanks for bumming us out, raven.  hey, we're not adults, yet.  let's play something stupid.  ooh. ooh. ooh. how about, uh, random animal rally.  ooh, ooh, quick, quick, name an animal.   uh. donkey.  no, no, miniature donkey. yeah.   oh. oh, do, uh, a cuttlefish.  pangolin.  give me something harder, mama.  lemur.  goodness.  i'd like to request a tiny donkey again.  one more donk in your face.  horseshoe crab. easy.  ooh, ooh, that one type of monkey with the bright red bottom whose name i cannot remember right now.  they're calledred butt monkeys, star.  can i get even tinier donkeys one more time.  this donk tiny enough for ya.  oh, oh, um, ah...  come on, name something.   give me a second, man.  man.   beast boy, you... what.  whoa.  i'm like a normal dude. i didn't even know i could do that.  i suppose a man is a type of animal.   you look like somebody's lame dad.  you have the hair everywhere but on your head.  is this common for those who chose the path of the dad.  you better turn back, beast boy, before you end up with a car payment and a loveless marriage.   but seriously...  wait.  as long as beast boy looks like an adult, he can take us to the movie.   meh, why not.     ah, yes. hello, fellow adult.  lovely weather we're having, eh.  also, gas prices, am i right. it's so crazy.  anyway, i'd like tickets to your next showing of the very mature death toilet 3.  one adult and four kids.   shhshh.  uh, what a handful, right.   it worked. come on. all: yeah.       that was awesome.  it was the best part. awesome.  i am glad the death toilet was able to save his wife from the terrorists.  and we would have missed it all if i wasn't an adult.  maybe being an adult isn't so bad.  i wonder what sort of other stuff we could get away with, having an adult around.      today was amazing.   i'm going to be an adult forever.  we all had fun.but you should turn back before the man, whoever he is,finds you and forces you to get a job.  yeah, well, maybe a job wouldn't be so bad.  the other parts of being an adult seem awesome.   indeed.  but for now, i believe it is time for the hitting of the hay.  tasty dreams, everyone.  not for me.  i'm staying up all night to do cool grown up stuff.  see you babies in the "a.m."  adults are the coolest.  the good morning.  would you care to join me in a bowl of extra sugary marshmallow crumbles.   uh, no.  too many calories. got to watch my weight.   beast boy, why are you still an adult.  ugh. because someone around here has to make a living.  oh, would you look at the time, i'm late for work.  the man is going to come down on me.  hey, listen, why don't you just transform back and we'll...  no. you listen, young man.  if you kids don't have all your chores done by the time i get home from work, consider your butts grounded.  you hear me.  it's just as i thought.  beast boy has gone over to the dad side.  the man must have gotten to him while he was out.  then we'd better follow him.   cyborg: look. there goes beast boy.  why would the beast boy find employment here.  it is the bland and the boring.  raven: like moths to a flame, adults are drawn to soul crushing office buildings.  it is the will of the man.  quick, before we lose him.     cyborg: what are you doing.  cyborg: move forward.     robin: it's like beast boy is being mindcontrolled.  raven: oh, he is, by the man.  yes, feed me.market reports,actionable items.  push the envelope.grow the business.   we got to bust him out of here.  as long as he's under the man's control, he won't come willingly.  perhaps if he were to be engulfed in the flames.  burn him to death. i like it.  okay, she means get him fired.  also a good plan.   ugh. blech.   unit 052, this workis unacceptable.  i'm afraid, i'm goingto have to fire you...  yes, it worked.  with real fire.  i understand. thank you for the opportunity.  not so fast, the man.  hey. what are youkids doing here.  i'm in the middle of a veryimportant meeting.  well, it's about to be rescheduled.  titans, go.  this is a place of business, not some cool internetskateboard cafe.  i summon the guardiansof the status quo.   ugh.  how can a few teenagers fight such a mature and fiscally responsible foe.  by doing what teens do best.   hey, you there.what are you doing.   are you loitering.  man.  oh, my god. she was all like, "what." and i'm all like, "duh" and she was like, "duh." and i was like, "shuh." you two.stop with the inaneconversation of words.  you.  stop reading that gookand listen to me.  don't you want todo something with your life.  whatever.   ugh. what is this stuff.     who's that. who's not...    i'm free.   and i have my hair again.  we thought we lost you for good, buddy.  man, being an adult is terrible. i'm never going to be one again.  speaking of the adults, what are we supposed to do with all of them.  we inspire their hearts and change their lives.  attention, hardworking citizens.  the man has been defeated.  you're all free to return to your homes and families.  the time of leading terrible, unfulfilling lives is over.  now, go and enjoy the gift of life.  but, robin, how will they provide for their families.  mmmmmmmm. i'm just a kid, not my problem.  go.    . teen titans, let's go .  .  tteen, tteeteen .  .  titans, do you knowwhat day it is.  all: wednesday.  hump day, baby.  oh, yeah. nothing betterthan the middle of the week.  hoohoohoo.hoohoohoo. humphump.   wednesday.  uh, first of all, it's friday.  all: friday.  enough. yes, it's friday.  but more importantly,it's payday.  why can it not be the wednesday.  woohoohoo. loopoopoo.  humphump.  so, what are you going to spend this money on.  i could really use a new robot badonkadonk.  ooh, i also wish to purchase the new robot badonkadonk.  books, books, books and some books and books.  books.   wrong.  wrong.  wrong, wrong, wrong and some wrong.  wrong.  money is not to be wasted on things that bring you happiness and joy.  money is to be hoarded, until your have enough money that your money makes more money.  and then you spend that money.  no. you hoard that money, too.  ew. this is why they say money is the root of all evil.  money. evil.  i know someone who might change your mind about that.  oh, well hi there. i am money.   hi, money. nice to meet you.  now, did someone here think i am evil.  it is him. the green one.  you are evil, bro. i know your heart.  money doesn't have a heart, beast boy.  exactly. he's evil.  watch your mouth or i'll break your bones.   what i mean is, how can i be evil when i'm just a little old piece of paper.   you're not paper, you're money.  silly, money.  i am paper, but i am also money.  all i am is an agreed uponrepresentative of credit.  something you tradefor goods and services.  so i can be anything.  even paper.  can money be a pineapple.  if everyone agrees on it, sure.  can money be rocks.  absolutely.  can money be the blurp blops.   now you're talking.  can money be robin's stupid face.  you show some respect. call me sir or dr.  money.  now, kneel before me or i will destroy you all.  my apologies, dr. money.  money's kind of creeping me out.  yeah, he's making me wanna be poor.  see. evil.  and you know what i do to evil.  no. stop it.   no.  oh, you're gonna make it, buddy.  hang in there.  no, no. it's too late for me, pal.    goodbye, cruel world.    that's it.   none of you are getting paid until you learn to respect money.  fine with , bro. we don't need your money.  but i wanna buy things so bad.  i also wish to trade the currency for goods and, or services.  yeah, people need money, beast boy.  animals don't use money.  and have you seen an unhappy dog.  of course. all the time.  look at that one.   my friends, we have no choice but to respect money, like robin has asked of us.  i'll never respect money, star.  not as long as it's evil.  but i have an idea.  ah. looks like someone bought some pizza.  well, in the spirit of commerce, may i buy a slice.  sure, dude, that'll be five bees.  what.  five bees for the slice of pizza.  bees.  how about i give you a dollar.   we only take real money here.  bees, brah.  bees aren't money, "brah".  you said it yourself, robin.  money represents credit, so money could be anything.  i choose bees.  but bees are not an agreed upon currency.  no one is gonna pay you in bees.  ooh, may i have a triangle of the pizza.  sure thing. five bees, please.  ow.  look, i don't have any bees.  how about flies.  will you take three flies for a slice.   three flies won't buy you anything.   i'd like a slice, but all i've got is a queen bee.  here's your pizza, and here's your )
