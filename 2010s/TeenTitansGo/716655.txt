medicine.  no, it's already too late.  we only have one option.  oh, no, no, no, no, no.  body adventure.  where are we.  looks like we're lost in the carpet.  not for long.  let's climb something tall to get our bearings.   ooh, that looks kinda far.  perhaps we should have gotten closer to my body first.     oh, hey, it's jerry, my favorite flea.  flea you later, jerry.  starfire: we have not moved but a few inches closer.  we're never going to make it. i'm going to die here, sick, tiny and alone.  not on my tiny watch. i have an ace up my sleeve.   silky horse.   we finally made it. body

were inhaling jelly, cyborg.   so fun.  mucus vines.  don't do that. it tickles.    oh, gross.   i need a shower.  okay, robin, maybe we should just take cyborg to a doctor.  no, we came in here to fight some viruses in an awesome showdown and that's what we're going to do.  look, there's one now. what's up, guys.   titans, go.  i would rather the not. i am not touching that thing.  gross, dude. uh, no thanks.     everything in this body is sticky and smelly and weird.  i thought a body adventure would be awesome but it's just gross.  come on, let's get out of here.  i'll just be over here, inflaming some membranes and spreading mucus and what have you.  how do we save poor cyborg now.  starfire: oh. raven: ugh.  maybe try calling a doctor.  fine. azarath metrion zinthos.    woman: 911,

here in searchof the smell of the gods.  you must be talking about the new, new car smell.  you like that, huh. bladow.  yeah, i've been tinkering, tweaking and straight up improverating everything on the tcar.  the engine's purring like a kitten. meow.  the suspension is springy like fresh baked bread. delicious.  the steering now handles like a car. honk, honk.  there's only so much you can do with steering.  this is why you are my best friend and only true confidant.  you act as if you hold more affection for the vehicle than for us, cyborg.  i do. you guys are garbage compared to my baby.  and i love you guys.  aw, he said he loved us.  he also called us garbage.  you have to understand, i found this carwhen it was just a baby.  couldn't fendfor himself, so i took him in, taught him karate,spanish and most importantly, how to be a man.  hola, coche.  none of that was true, starfire.  but it feels true, which makes it true.  i wish you guys could love this car the way i love him.  oh, i know what we're doing... road trip.   come on. a road trip is the most fun thing in the world.  we'll bring snacks...  snacks.  road trip.  we'll bond as team mates and learn life lessons we'll
