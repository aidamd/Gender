jail.  i know for a fact this is not jail.  raven. tell her.  tell her what. she's in jail.  can i just serve out my sentence in peace.  saying you're in jail does not prove you're in jail.  and saying i'm not in jail doesn't prove i'm not in jail.  she's got a point.  uh, but it's not... bars, no jail...  i'm sorry but visiting hours are over. the guards are strict.  but... rules are rules.

jail.  oh, yeah.  that's right. how can you be in jail if you're out in the open.  huh. huh. huh.  uh, this is the prison yard.  then where are the walls.  huh. huh. huh.  well, you just can't see them because it's a really big prison.  yeah. you've never seen a big prison before.  of course i have. but this is not a prison.  this is a city, and i am going to prove it.  shh. keep it down.

concluded listening to the cool music, you can take a cool ride on my cool cycle motor.  vroomvroom.  i am bad to the skeleton parts.  check me out. sunglasses inside. at night.  i'm so cool, i can't see nothing.   cool.   wanna see something cool.  always. check this out.  howdy.  whoa. you almost hit sticky joe.  okay. i'll do this one with my eyes closed.  wait. what if you hit him.  who cares. i do.  oh, okay, i'm doing it anyway.  howdy.  i am not gonna let you throw knives at sticky joe.  you telling me what to do.  someone has to.    oof.    that's too bad.  i was hoping we could be friends.  but you know... whatever.  rose wilson.  you're either going back to jail or if this is jail, you're staying here.  what's with the clothes.  can't you tell. we went to cool school.  cool school is not cool.  but don't worry, you'll be dead soon and dead people are cool.      any uncool last words.  raven.  we may not be the cool, but we are the true friends.  and that is more important.   that is so corny.  that's it.  rose is so cool her only weakness is earnest emotions.  we can take her down with feelings.  titans, share.   i should say this more often.  you've always been like a sister to me.   ugh, you're making a scene.  oh, come on, guys, this is embarrassing.  no. no, mama, let us finish, please.  we thinks you're the bees knees.   your lack of irony is making me sick.  raven, all we're trying to say is...  we love you.  i love you guys, too. group hug.  rose: you're a real disappointment, raven.  well, guess i'm not cool.  rose wilson is finally back in jail.  actually, you're in jail.   that's, uh, not gonna work this time, rose.  really. because to me it looks like you're behind bars.  yeah, well, yes, technically, from your angle it would appear that way.  mmm. that's something someone in jail would say.  argh. raven, tell her. tell her.  yeah. she's in jail.  at workshop.  come celebrate the minions movie with stuart, kevin and bob.  and
