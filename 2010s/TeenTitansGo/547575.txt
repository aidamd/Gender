   titans.   time to teach h.i.v.e. how to play nice, titans.  oh, and since mammoth is the biggest and baddest, he's all mine.  titans, go.   robin, could i assist you with an eye blast.   no way, star.  mammoth is all mine.   are you sure you don'tneed a hand, bro.  i've got twovery small ones to lend.  no.   i want to make this last.  you know...  to teach him a lesson.   let me guess, we're waiting on robin again.   yes.  so, who's carrying him home this time.   great job, titans.  bet you're all as exhausted as i am.  uh, not particularly.  all i really did was stare in the enemy's general direction.  love the attitude.  but i know your every muscle is screaming in excruciating pain.  nope, don't have muscles.  and mine are all like, "it's all good, dude.  "peace and love." so, basically, thanks to your superpowers, taking down one of the deadliest threats to the planet is no big deal.  uhhuh. yep.  pretty much. exactly.  huh, that's cool.   problem, robin.  it's not fair, i do just as much as all of you, but because you have superpowers, you get to be super lazy.  super lazy. you're crazy.  it was so far away.  sure, robin, powers make some things easier, but mostly they're a curse.  curse. please.  well, look at me.  who wants to be your friend when you're basically the spawn of an intergalactic demon.  she's right, robin.  all my life everyone has always looked at me like a freak.  and it's been so long since i felt the sweet sensation of knee skin.  i am going to make the meatloaf for dinner.  the only curse would be how bad i'd make you look.  guess we'll never know.  since the only way guys like you get superpowers is through super horrible freak accidents.  super horrible freak accidents.  that's it.  all right. ready, buddy.  just going to merge our dna.  no big deal.   what are the superpowers of a robin.  well, uh, good question.  flight, picking things up off the ground with your mouth.  your crazy old bird feet. stuff like that.  nothing like a little lab disaster to give you superpowers.     bad idea. bad idea. bad idea.    i can't believe my luck.  i just washed my car and it's already covered in bird dookie.  sorry, my bad.   oh.  what happened to you.  and what are you doing, pooping on my car.  ugh.  i tried to give myself superpowers.  by turning yourself into "the chicken".   guess it didn't really work out like i was hoping.  does this mean you finally realized superpowers are a curse.  no way. this doesn't count...   wait... one sec.   this doesn't count since i didn't get any powers.  i almost want to give you superpowers.  just to teach you a lesson.  you can give me powers.  of course i can, but you have to be sure this is something you really want.    that was a yes.  okay, but before i can there's something you need to do.  what.  don't play dumb, you know exactly what.  i'm not doing the chicken dance for you.  chicken dance. no.  chicken dance. nope.  dance of the chicken. dance of the chicken.    happy.  you almost made me smile.  almost.  now, don't say we didn't warn you.  azarath metrion zinthos.   heat vision.  stop it.  freeze breath. come on.  super speed. hey.  telekinesis. tele...  move things withyour mind powers.  really.  this is awesome.  just remember, with great power comes greater responsibility.  the burden you'll be asked to carry will be even bigger.  you'll definitely be different than all of your friends, dude.  did i mention we are having the meatloaf for dinner.  yes, robin, you will be forever a stranger in a world that can never truly understand you.  a curse. a curse.  a curse. meatloaf.  wrong. this is going to be great.  wait till he sees what it's really like.  he won't be smiling then.  i almost feel sorry for the guy.  i'm back.  you were gone for less than a blurtbot.  super speed. thanks, raven.   so you know the pain of having super powers, the agony.  nope. it was great.  i rounded up every super villain and put them in jail.  in three seconds.  i also used my powers to grow crops and solve world hunger.  i ended all wars too.  oh, is that all.  and i made meatloaf for dinner.  joy.  so you're saying you solved all the world's problems.  uhhuh.  and there arno more super villains to battle.  you know it.  then i guess we don't have to be teen titans anymore.  that's right... wait. what.  nice going, robin. you just put us all out of a job.  guess this is goodbye.  see ya. raven: later.  i will miss you all.  wait. what am i gonna do.  get a new jouess.  let's see. it says here, you worked for the teen titans.  yes, sir. uh, we were a team of superheroes.  were. you were fired.  well, no. not fired. just disbanded.  i kind of solved all the world's problems.  right. and under special skills you listed xray vision.  yup.  you start monday.       what happened.  where did it go wrong.  where did i lose my purpose.  ah. it was when i got my powers.   they were right.  these powers were a curse.  in your face, robin.   vindication.  uhhuh. that's right.  super powers are a curse, curse, curse, cursity, curse, curse, curse.  see, told you so.  curse.   liftoff.   you are now approaching the milky way. alien craft incoming.  pew pew pew.  it's a black hole, look out.  goldfish grahams. come in, goldfish graham.  cool party.  smoothies.  ...  they've been burstified. huh.

orange scream danimals smoothie.  terrifyingly tasty.   only two more hours till the 3 am zompire movie marathon.   are you guys as excited as me.   oh, yeah.zombies and vampires.   come on, beast boy.wake up.   we've been waitingall week for this. wake up.  wake up.  wake up.   wake up.     i'm up.  why do they get to sleep.  starfire is not sleeping. see.   i am up.  and raven was just resting her eyes.  i'm up.  last warning, guys.  fall asleep and i start drawing mustaches again.     hey, what's the pen for, cyborg.  why is it so easy for me to stay awake.  you are half robot.   there is less of you to get tired.   you know, this isn't the first time you guys have ruined things with your flesh and blood, and more flesh.  as soon as i get this baby humming it's vaca time.  hold this a sec.    why can't you guys be awesome like me.  super strength.  fireproof armor.  high jump moves, and power.  maybe one day we'll all benefit from an accident that requires us to replace several body parts. but until then...     this is just great.  you know how hard it is to clean between my sensitive robot parts.  no big deal, cyborg.  we'll just dismantle you, clean your parts, and put you back together.  dismantle me. you guys can't even program a vcr.  vcr.  vcr, 1980s device that allowed you to tape television shows even if you weren't at home.  they mostly used vhs tapes, even though betamax was clearly the superior format.  and nobody knew how to program that clock on.  i mean, you had to be like a rocket scientist to figure that one out.  so they always flashed 12:00.  vcrs revolutionized home entertainment.  we can handle this, cyborg.  looks like i don't have a choice.     there. clean as the baby's behind.  it's soft as a baby's behind, star.  those things aren't usually so clean.  yes, i am saying we did an awful job.  can you just put me back together.  that doesn't go with the...  be careful with the...  watch out for my...  okay, this is not how i go back together.   i don't know. i'm pretty sure that's how i remember you.  yup. agreed.  then what about all those extra parts.  yes. extra parts, cyborg.  as in, you do not need them.  that's my leg you're sitting on.  sorry, cyborg. but we've done everything we can.  you can't leave me like this. it's undignified.  i feel like webster.  webster.  webster. 1980s tv show, with that tiny kid who was like 40 in real life.  you know, his parents die, so the dad's ol' football buddy adopts him.  george papadapolis with his wife katherine.  but webster calls her "ma'am".  there's an episode where he uses a science kit, even though ma'am warned him not to.  and he accidently burns down the whole apartment building.  the whole building. oh, it was crazy.  i have all six seasons on vhs.  if we can't put your body back together maybe we can upload you into the tower computer.  yeah. and then you'd be completely electronic.  none of that gross flesh and blood stuff going on.  you make ag case.  let's give it a whirl.  okay, that's good. ow.  i'm on... ow.  thank you. ow.  getting a little tight in here. ow.  i'm connected toall the tower's systems.   airconditioning,doors,
