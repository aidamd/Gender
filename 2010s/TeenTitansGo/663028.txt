 this was my evil plan of course.  for eons i've been trying to rid the world of sound so i could finally be heard.  all i needed was a halfdemon to tickle my tummy tumtums, and that was you, raven.   now listen to how loud i am.  you may want to cover your ears.  okay, i'm going to scream now.    oh, i can't hear you.   i don't understand.  are you hungry. you want to go outside.  what.   okay, just write it down or something.  "azarath metrion zinthos".  the rest of the world may still be silent, but at least we have our voices back.  oh, yeah.    yeah.  yes.   and i immediately regret it.  you should.  silence is a gift and you pooped on it.  great job, raven.  why don't you just tickle every tummy you come across.  well, it seemed like a good deal at the time.  how is a world without sound a good deal.  yeah. how am i going to know if i've got a squeaky hinge. how.  will i never again hear the meows of the sweet, sweet kitties.  well, maybe if you all weren't so loud all the time, i wouldn't have made this deal.  oh, it's okay, mama, there's at least one good thing that came out of this.  what.   silent but deadly has a new meaning, yo.   ow.  guys, check this out.  boing.  you were just making that noise.  no. i'm not. look.  boing.  that's so trippy, yo.  how is the cyborg mouth sound coming from that spring.  well, i was just hanging out in my room, missing sound and all, so i started creating my own sound effects.  whoa.  that is so good. i know, right.  so, i started to flick this spring while saying, "boing." boing.  and after a while, it made the sound on its own.  that's amazing.  it sure is.  can you do a water sprinkler, cyborg.  please.   ooh. do the bull frog.   no, i meant it's amazing the sound he made printed onto the object.  it seems the whisperer has created a sound vacuum to which we can assign our own sounds.  you mean we can replace the missing sounds in the world.  then, titans, let's make sounds.     crack.  whack.  smack.  crackalackasmacksmack.     hey, hey, hey.  hey, hey, hey.  it's working.     bam. bam. bam.          ha. we did it, titans.    ew.  really, beast boy. you had to make punches sound like farts.   so much better than how it used to sound, bro.   ow.   hilarious.  if punches sound like farts, what do farts sound like.    titans, just listen to the world of sound we've created.  blah.  booyah. booyah. booyah.   i don't like this. yes, it is the bad.  then there's only one option.   we must makethe dangerous journey to the whisperer and force her to releasethe world's sounds.  rawr. rawr.  hoothoot. hoothoot.  cheese.    we're being watched.   aw, dude, there's a little kittykittykitty over there.  i'm gonna go say hi.   ahh. it's a monster.  why did you make it sound like a sweet kitty.    why.  it was the judgment call. i am sorry.  help me. punch it or something.   titans, go.  ahh.   oh, man, it's so funny.  ow. get it off of me.       tiptoe, tiptoe, tiptoe.  spwa. shwa.  the whisperer:nice try, but i heard youcoming a mile away.   whisperer.  we've filled the world up with our own sounds, so there's no point in holding the real ones hostage.  i actually like what you've done.  it's so bad, it'll encourage people to stay quiet.  i guess the one thing you don't know about the titans is that we're loud and proud.  hit it.   from the tiggitytop.  one, two, three, four.     titans:. bring on the night. .   no. no. so terrible.  even worse than before.  oh, here, take your sounds.  shwa.  spling.   blah.   booyah. booyah. booyah.   hey, hey, hey.  hey, hey, hey...  sorry, guys, i was wrong when i thought i wanted silence.  but hey, looks like all the sounds made it back to their proper places.  not all of 'em.    cyborg: come on.  warn somebody.   go...  whoa  you can go bananas...  with a talking toy from the new movie "minions" rated pg.  and the goodness of new gogurt strawberrybanana yogurt.  the newest flavor in yourmcdonald's happy meal.          incoming.  yea..      capri sun. push play.     ah.  the great outdoors.  what's so great about it.we're sleeping on rocks.  rocks.  and all there is to eatis beef jerky. blah.  and there are no toilets.  i am still the confusedas to why we are sleeping out of the doors.  is the tower broken.  no. we're out here because camping is fun.  hiking, making s'mores, campfires...  beast boy: wild animal attacks.  starfire: the body odors.  can we go home.  no. you are having too much fun.  fine. let's just watch some tv.  where are you going to plug in a tv.  he's right. i don't see any outlets.  you mean... no tv.   we don't need tv to entertain us.  that's what scary campfire stories are for.  huh. that could be fun.  you think my idea could be fun.  sure. why not.  and you're going to do it, and i don't have to scream at anyone.  it sounds the delightful.   keep it together, robin. don't blow this. for once they're all excited.  hmm, not me. i still want to go home.  three out of four. i'll take it.  who wants to go first.  i do. i gots a super scary story.  i just hope you all brought a change of underpants.  beast boy: so, there was this lumberjack dude who was lost in the woods and all walking aroundin circles like a fool.  aroundin

abooger on his finger saying, "i got you where i want you.now i'm gonna eat you."   cyborg: that was the disgusting.   oh, i got you so good.  you should see your faces.  beast boy: oh.  that's for telling a story about a booger.  seriously, can we go home now.  first, i wish to attempt the telling of the spooky story.  on a scary day, the friends were having the )
