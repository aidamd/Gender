to listen to you.   snug as a bug in a rug, dude.  and then you're all, "oh, i'm powering down."  booyah.  and no one's worse than you, star.    okay. so, maybe the sleep fighting's a problem.  i believe this calls for the use of the demon sorcery, raven.  dark magic isn't supposed to be used for stupid things.  but what's the point of having powers if you don't use them for stupid things.  dark magic tends to get out of hand when not treated with respect.  there could be unintended consequences.   unintended consequences.  you just say that so we don't always ask you for stuff.  fine. just don't say i didn't warn you.   azarath metrion zinthos.  guess we'll know if it worked in the morning.     looks like rave's spell worked.  yes. we have all slept like the small child.  i did have a pretty great dream.  how'd you sleep, robin.   need some sleep. no, no sleep.  i can't sleep. don't sleep.  what's wrong with you, dude.    i'm up.  oh. so that's how rave's spell works.  so very, very cruel.  but there weren't any of her "unintended consequences." you know what that means.  don't. oh, yeah.  time for the, "you were wrong" dance.   . pick an appleput it in the basket . pick an appleput it in the basket . row that boat dig a hole . shake it like a quikshake it like a quik . so wrong, so wrongraven was so wrong . wrong, so wrongraven was so wrong .  now perhaps we can use your powers to fix anything that annoys us.   you guys are the only things that keep me sane in this house.  what's that, butterbean.  princess silkie soft needs us for an important mission.  cyborg:. booboobooyahyahyahboo .  that is right, my pretty, pretty pegasus.  i, princess silkie soft...  silkie.  yes, i, princess silkie soft...  cyborg:. booboobooyahyahyahboo .  ...needs you to

to fix that problem.  uh, why are your eyes glowing all scary like that.  booyah.  azarath metrion zinthos.    what's wrong, bro.   what happened to your mouth.   i can't understand a thing you're

lunch time.   what is wrong with you, mama.  i was just wondering the same thing about you.  azarath metrion zinthos.  you turned me into a balloon.  how's that fixing me.  oh, you can still change into animals.  any animal i want.    ooh, look, a poodle.  but i don't want to be a poodle.   there's so much more to fix.   that's the worst argument ever.  guys, guys, guys.   you okay, dude. yeah.  all we have to do...   what. what are you laughing at.  i will wipe that smile off your face, cyborg.   hey.  cyborg. whoa.  you learned to talk out of your nose.  every time raven uses her dark magic for stupid reasons it makes her more and more evil.  this is the unintended consequence she was talking about.  wait. she's going to fix starfire next.    how could you. how could you.  she has given me...  the big hair.  i look like a ripe banana.  i think it looks kind of cute.  that woman has lost her humanity.   we are going to have to talk to raven. starfire:  why. why.  just not with your nose full, it's rude and it's gross.     yes, sparkleface, princess silkie soft is going to be married to the gum drop king.  isn't that right, princess.   silkie.  beast boy: hey, mama.  ah, we're just thinking that maybe you're taking this changing stuff thing a little too far.     you were saying.  that's it. we've had enough, raven.  titans.  ow.   you know, maybe there's just no fixing you guys.   there's only one way to reach her in this state.  through the only things that keep her sane.   we just wanted to talk.  isn't that right, sparkleface.  oh, that is correct, the bean of butter.   sparkleface. butterbean.  but most of all, we really miss the old raven and hope she'll come back to play with us, the horses.   okay. cut it out. cut it out.  if only we could all be like sparkleface and butterbean.  you're absolutely right, butterbean.  sorry, guys. i guess i got a little carried away with the changes.  cyborg: it's cool, rave.   who wants to race.   ugh.  azarath
