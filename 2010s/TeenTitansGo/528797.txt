definitely making fun of us.  i mean it sincerely when i say you're a welloiled crime fighting machine.  he does have a point, we could work together better.  this is exactly why we need those mandatory meetings.  i'm trying to say your teamwork is your greatest strength, which is how i came up with my latest plan.  this device will amplify my mind control powers, allowing me to erase every memory you have ever had together as the teen titans.  no team, no one to stop me.  jump city will be mine.   we'll never let you, blood.    who are you. where am i.  have i eaten today.  i didn't say now.  now.  uh, what's going on, bro.  how did i get into this large letter shaped building.  i don't like this.   don't panic, you're just a little confused because all of your memories were erased.  my name is robin and i am your leader.  all i ask is for your unconditional respect and admiration and we will get through this.  okay, first order of business.  what do you guys think of my hands.  they're fine. they look good to me.  seem normal.  excellent. the ray might have affected your memory, but your minds are as sharp as ever.   why is the orange girl talking all funny.  she has forgotten our language and reverted back to her native tongue.   well, what's she saying then.   she's a... she's just flirting with me.   where to start.  wait a minute.  why are you the leader.  because i'm the strongest.  i've got all sorts of powers.  in fact, i single handedly formed the teen titans. yes.  really. i don't remember that.  that's because your memory was erased, beast boy.  hmm. i don't remember that either.  listen up, once upon a time, in a land far away, but also right here.  i built this great bigtshaped tower with my superpowerful robot suit.  but then,i came across poor cyborg who was destituteand just a head.  i let him borrow my suit so he could beawesome like me.  oh, thanks.  and you, beast boy.  i found you abandoned onthe top of mount everest.  and i fed you like a baby bird, until you grew up bigand strong.  wow.  so that's how i got so big and strong.  what about me.  ah, yes, raven.  back then you were just a little purple blanket.  i used my magical powersto bring you to life.  wow, i used to be a blanket and now i'm a real girl.  thanks, robin.  and finally, starfire.  she's my girlfriend, so, you know, kinda had to let her be on the team. oh.  i get it. been there.    that's... that's so sweet.  uh, she was telling me how handsome i look.  uh, yes, raven.  i want to say how much i'm enjoying this mandatory meeting.  teach us more, leader. yeah, this rocks.   ah, you flatter me.  uh, what else.  ah, starfire, did you know that tamaraneans can learn any language through lip contact.  . remember the days whenwe used to kiss . now somewhatoutta rhythm... .    i love you too, baby.  king robin. no, raven. you used to just call me king to save time.  oh, yeah, yeah. that sounds right.  king, i was hoping you could regale us with some more tales of your awesomeness.  more.  i've been telling you about my awesomeness all day.  please. you're just so cool.  and then, we can have a mandatory meeting afterwards.   okay, okay, since you asked so nicely.  one dark day, in the not so distant past, an evil super villainnamed brother blood captured you guys and lockedyou in an inescapable cage, hanging over a volcano,on the moon.  whoa. the moon.  that's incredible.  yes.  i had to use my ability of flight to soar all the wayup to the moon.   then i blasted brother bloodinto oblivion with my heat vision eyes.   i used my magical telepathicthought waves  to float you to safety.  ooh. that was intense. whoa. thought waves.  could we have that mandatory meeting now.   uhoh.  the mandatory meeting is going to have to wait.   brother blood is robbing the jump city weapons depot.  robin: hello, brother blood.  this time you're going down for good.  titans, go.  no way. we want to see you fight, great leader.  yeah, go get him.  use your awesome heat vision to obliterate him.  uh, right. about that heat vision...   ooh.  what are you waiting for, king.  do some magic or something. aah.   ah, it's just you and me now, star.   you want to hug me now, robin.  ow.  oh, this is my fault.  you. you're a great leader.   the, uh...  the stories i told you, i made them up.   i just wanted you to respect me.  here's the truth.  cyborg, i never gave you your awesome robot body.  no. robin: and, beast boy, i never raised you from a wee chick.  it can't be true.  robin: raven, you were never a blanket.  i don't believe it.  robin: and sadly, starfire's never been my girlfriend.  but there's one thing that might trigger your memories.  take a cold, hard look at my hands.    that dude's got baby hands. look at them.  say what. they're so small and chubby.   yes, i am your leader and i have baby hands.   baby hands.   raven. starfire.  cyborg. beast boy.  your memories have been restored.  titans, go.   oh yeah.  the teen titans are back and better than ever.  so, i guess that means you're going to stop listening to me again.  hey, we may not listen to you sometimes.  or respect you.  and, sure, we like
