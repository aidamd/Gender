homeless and filthy.   there's not enough food or seats.  they need to leave, right now.  aw, they won't eat much.  just enough to fill their little disgusting rat bellies.     they can stay. but no more rats.  and don't let them gnaw on the decorations.  i spent a lot of time on them.    behold.  the thanksgiving rite of the foot and the ball.  scoredown. ahhh.  cheerleaders: be aggressive.  be aggressive.   starfire, what are you doing.  i am contributing a traditional thanksgiving game.   puntoff.     dad, what are you doing.  ah, honey, you're here.  be a dear and help me chop off your friend's skinny bird head, okay.    this always happens.  you show up acting all nice, but then you commit some unspeakable evil.  aw, i just wanted my daughter's turkey day to actually have a turkey.  oh, so that makes it okay to eat one of my friends.  i chose the one you like least.  i like robin the least. we can eat him, too.     dad.  robin: any minute now.  decorations in place, food... whoa.  what.   beast boy.  i told you not to invite more rats.  i didn't, dude. then why are there more rats.   miracle of life, bro.  mama rats plus papa rats make baby rats.  batman is going to be here at any moment.  what is he going to think.  don't you know he likes bats, not rats.  bats, not rats.  bats. not rats.       trigon:  slippery rascal.  i've got him, i've got him, i've got him now.  get away from my friend.   thanksgiving needs a turkey.     fine.  just eat cyborg.  you never listen to me anyway.     all i wanted was for today to be perfect.  perfect for who, dad.  well, if your "perfect" thanksgiving doesn't include eating one of your friends, then so be it.  thanks, dad.  now, change cyborg back and let's go get ready for dinner.  oh, uh... i can't.  he's stuck as a turkey until at least christmas.  magic.  pretty crazy, huh.  the decorations are up, the table is set.  perfect.  but, robin, where will you sit.   i forgot a seat for me.  don't worry, brah, we saved you one at the kids' table.  the kids' table. not the kids' table.  i got to sit here every year. rickety table legs that don't even match my...   oh.  let us commence the feast.  no. i said nobody eats until batman arrives.  where is he going to sit.  he's batman. he sits where he likes.  now, while we wait, everybody just...  just say what you're thankful for.  i'll start.  i'm thankful that i was able to put together a perfect thanksgiving.  even though some people tried to ruin it.   oh, yeah. well, i'm thankful for my cool new rat friends who understand the point of a holiday actually...   robin.  i'm thankful my dad turned my friend into a turkey.  i'm thankful to be here with my daughter, even if she doesn't appreciate my gifts to her.   well said, my juicy, meaty, delicious friend.   i can't help myself.  i need to eat that robot turkey.   food fight.     scoredown.  take that.  you're all off the seating chart.         yeah.  i guess i ruined thanksgiving for everyone.  yes, you did.  but everyone's terrible actions have helped me understand the true meaning of this celebration.  and that is why i am thankful that you are our leader, robin, and my friend.   i'm thankful you always make me feel better about myself.  want to help me clean up my mess.  what. how.  it is the christmas miracle of the thanksgiving.  who did this.  it was the rats.   they say that usually they don't have a place to go or food, or even a chance to see their family.   tonight, though, they had all that and more.   they think this was the best thanksgiving ever.  and to say thanks, they wanted to give something back.  a thanksgiving feast.   amazing. but what about the turkey.  oh, dad and i took care of that.     hurt.  mine hurt more.  mine stopped hurting faster.

no, bro, it was like...   oh, man.  guys, hold up. shh.   oh man, that one stunk. speak too, cyborg.  this is so annoying.   ooh. they are giving me the aches of the head.  we're being such boys rightnow and i love it.  boys. boys. boys. boys.   b...b...b... boys.  b...b...b... boys.  boys.  b...b...b... boys.  b...b...b... boys, in your face.  quiet.  uh, what's her problem.  i'll tell you her problem. she's a "her", you know, a girl.  that's right. she wishes she could be a boy...   but she can't.  why would we wish to be the boys.  because of one simple fact.  boys are better than girls.   how can one say one gender is superior to the other.  well, starfire,  if you ever took the knowledge train down town to the corner of science and fact, you'd know girlscan never compete with boys, about howthey look and being emotional.   uh, lying around.  you're the ones who are lazy.  and you spend much more time on your hair appearance than do we.  and if you're going to bring up emotional...  stop yelling at us.   oh, my selfesteem.  still think boys are better.  of course they are. in fact, i could go on and on about all the reasons girls are worse than boys, but i'm going to sum it up in just one word...  cooties.   you're crawling with them.  we don't want your cooties.  as you can see from this chart, created by a boy, science tells us that there is no evidence in girls of sugar, spice or anything nice.  what there is, is cooties.  oh, gross.  gross indeed, beast boy.  i rest my case.   i have the cooties.  no, you don't. cooties aren't real.  if boys are so much better, then prove it.  we challenge you to a contest, boys vs. girls.   )
