jakers, the adventures of piggley wings. 	but this is still good because now we will travel to the world with the most equipped detective, this starts now in a favorite place, planet u, your planet, your life, your world. 	 here the gadget inspector this case is history, mystery and fun. 	now a breakthrough of the research of demos a look at some of the places that we will visit. 	 i wonder what the airline would have done with my luggage. 	where is london i will need my gadget wit to find the location. 	go ahead, globe gadget just like what london is and according to my brain bionic britain actually is formed from four countries under the same england, northern ireland, scotland, to check if they are attentive i will tell you that britain also will can 000 years the cavemen lived 000 years later people lived kings and queens still live in castles and look at the hats of those wait, they are not cavemen but guards who protect the kings of the united kingdom. 	it is not correct to call it wait, according to my gadget dictionary a kingdom is a territory or state subject to a kingdom is also called for centuries kings and queens were the ultimate authority of which we will later find out who the great ruler is now. 	the tower of london is one of the most famous castles was a royal palace and a prison. 	some say that the tower the phrase "headless" sounds better than up, up just as i suspected, actually the tower of london consists of 16 38 guards also called alabarteros, its nickname is carnivorous. why do they believe. 	some say it was because kings used to feed them chicken. 	this tower used to be a royal palace two of the kings lived and ruled. 	it was also where they imprisoned and executed for the last 600 years the royal family has preserved the crown jewels in the tower except when they are worn at times surprising, the imperial crown has so many diamonds, sapphires and rubies and look, a bat baseball. 	it is actually the scepter an ornament that is always worn in the hand has the world's largest diamond called africa star. 	would you believe that it is 530, i mean, speaking of greatness, the ax was widely used in the tower during the sixteenth century when enrique viii was king and was famous for his great appetite, his great waist and his armor also had six when was married to ana bolena believed he had been unfaithful, brought the tower and made the i thought the worst thing was to be punished in the corner. 	the prisoners were brought to the tower by the entrance of some were imprisoned here in the and were later executed. 	for more than 900 years the crows have also eight legend says that if they one day fly away the tower of london will collapse and the king will not be so etetetetetetetet not some crows live until these have names like larry, charly, cedrick and jackie 	their diet consists of six ounces of raw meat all then the crows are also amazing, over there is the world famous tower many people think it is the london bridge, then where is the bridge and we will cross that bridge when it arrives the one did not want to be grown up to be king of some of the younger leaders were enrique iii, nineyearold eduard v, 12 and lady jane she was beheaded after being queen for only nine days. 	 you can meet london from ... 	i want to be driven here by the side you can walk by taxi, by double decker bus or by the london subway called the tube. 	there is something not seen every day unless you live the largest store in the world is as big as 15 football fields with 300 departments. 	what is that by the river. 	no, it's the big ben and the building's going on, auto gadget. 	my infallible instinct tells me that contrary to popular belief big ben is not the name of the huge clock tower. 	big ben is actually on behalf of the thirteen and a half tonne bell that if you weigh 13 and a half tons you can make yourself call as you like. 	big ben and the four small bells can be heard 20 miles away in a day with its real name is the big clock is the largest, most powerful and most accurate popular watch in the world. 	before most of the people and it is very large for the minute timers to be 14 feet long, that is longer than there is a separation e between every minute that functions like a huge cuckoo clock. 	a 13foot pendulum swings every two seconds. 	its movement is regulated by the weight of a heap of cents, if a penny falls the accuracy of the watch will be incorrect. 	the world clocks depend on the precision of the 334 steps from the top of the big ben downwards lead you to the house of parliament which has 1100 rooms, 100 stairs and two miles of this is the center of government of great britain. 	these corridors may seem long if you look here are the members of parliament talking civilly. 	there are two cameras in the one is the camera of the commons, its members are chosen by british citizens and sit in green room. 	the other chamber is the chamber of lords, some lords are chosen by the queen and others inherit their position. 	susu camera is real red. 	the leader of the entire cabinet today the queen does not have could be said to be a symbol of the british royal past. 	 we're back with the gadget inspector's trips here on your planet u. 	now we continue with the trips of the gadget inspector here on your u raises. 	 and now an official figure, what height has the tallest man of eight feet and 11 this is a replica of robert pershing wadlow in the guinness museum where you can experience it as you stand next to the smallest man, the heaviest , and even the woman with the neck one more moment, that is the second longest neck. 	well, i guess bionic does not count. 	here the gadget inspector in front of buckingham palace, the house of a grand ceremony called "changing the guard" takes place but it is impossible to see with all this go, we gadget video cameras. 	better. surprising. 	look how they go, those tall hats used to be made with bear skin. 	at present they are made of synthetic material and the bears are much happier for that reason. 	 let's forget the guards and see something new. 	let's investigate what's behind those doors. 	 buckingham palace for royalty has it all, with 661 rooms and thrones, glass chandeliers and even a hidden door behind which an avenue called paulmall connects the trafalgar palace with the trafalgar square, downtown. 	thousands of pigeons come here that's what they do best. 	i wonder if there will be a dove at the tip of this cranny, that's not one he made his first trip with the english navy when he had and then drove england to victory fighting napoleon at the battle of the river thames is one of the most important rivers of europe. 	runs right in the heart to the river bank there is a palace called hampdon court many people of royalty have lived here through the years. 	including the huge king by the size of the kitchen you can see that enrique was eating very well. 	the walls of the palace are decorated with old, these must be the old royal rooms. 	surprising, that yes that is a big bed, there could stretch my gadget legs. 	the actual toilet is even covered with red velvet "toilet" is the british term for, well, you imagine. 	enrique viii built one of the world's largest labyrinths on the banks of hampdon court, it was a good way to get rid of the visitors, it was fun to see, can you find the way out. 	 if you manage to get out of this labyrinth you can reach the se is good, just a couple the port of london is right next to the tower bridge. 	a version of the bridge was disarmed and taken to the united states to lake havasu, arizona where the bridge was reassembled stone by stone and is still there. 	picadilly circus is where you will find the action throughout the night and picadilly circus is amazing. 	in the 1600s men were out there in sunny shirts called picadils. 	circus is an old word entered to determine a great and hence they got the amazing name of picadilly circus. 	surprising, it was dark there. 	here the gadget inspector in front of the imperial museum of a very in fact the museums of london are very curious places for curious. 	up, up, gadgetcopter. 	great britain participated in several wars. 	you can see planes, tanks, and even individual submarines in which you can enter a submarine and go down to the trenches with figures of and talking about figures, i want you to observe these that are found no less than in the famous wax museum of madame tusseau . 	how many can you recognize. 	come on, come on, madame. 	 makes 200 madame tusseau sculpted figures in size and up head by head, eye for eye, hand by hand and pelopor maybe some day the old gadget inspector is it's time to investigate more about the treasures of london. 	 we're back with the gadget inspector's trips here on your planet u. 	'' force  nature fusion shampoo helps repair your hair and gives you 10 times more strength against damage, thanks to the fusion of its provitaminica formula with casia. 	i know how to look amazing hair without going to the living room. 	when it comes to your hair, be the expert. 	yo, pantene.s travel gadget inspector here on your u raises. 	the british museum has an incredible display of all kinds of mummies up to 3000 years of antiguard. develops painted with gold, mummies of young people and even mummies of cats. 	and where are the dads. 	this colossal statue of egyptian king ramses ii granite dating back to the year 1250, at that time, the kings were called pharaohs. 	this man has been preserved in this position since 3250 years before and for sure is a we are out of my favorite museum in the direction that sir john conan doyle gave this fictional character the famous detective and my hero sherlock homes. 	this is the imaginary house here is his imaginary pipe, his hat, and his famous magnifying glass. 	these seem to be the tools you used to solve hundreds of as well as i use my artifacts. 	looks like it's time for the detective to sleep. 	sharlock homes was a fictional character, but the real detectives of london began in 1829 years later they moved to a new scotland yard and today this is the new scotland yard. 	sir robert pilk, called bobby, created this force and that's why british police officers are called will need some basic qualities to become a bobby come on, let's plaque gadget. 	one should have good vision, good sense of citizenship, good character and be able to swim 100 or 110 yards preferably in the water. 	 i think with this we concluded our first i had a lot of fun on our trip visiting the big ben, the tower of london and the amazing palace, wish you had fun and we will see you on our next trip. bye. 	behave well and do not forget to turn your globe up, up, gadgetcopter. 	   chile is a land of spectacular and great is a country that have the andes mountain range, the driest desert in the world, the atacama, the cold of the arctic and the warmest almost half of the population lives near the capital, which is santiago. 	the folk music of chile is characterized by the mix of traditional, aboriginal sounds with those brought from one of lol most tourist places in chile is the easter island which is in the middle of the ocean here tourists come to see the statues meaning of moais is uncertain, but they think that these volcanic stones were carved by the polynesian inhabitants of the islands between the seventeenth centuries as a representation of deceased ancestors. 	interesting. this begins now in your favorite place, your planet u, your planet, your life, your world. 	  i am the gadget inspector in the middle of the sherwood forest. 	robin hood could appear at any time, but it does not appear because we are in the capital of our nation, in this case the results of politicians could be announced at any time, even so this is a jungle. 	 dc washington is home to the nation's treasures, and they are duly stored in dc means district is located between the states of virginia and right in downtown washington there is a castle but because we do not have one here we have the smithsonian institution, but it is called the castle in case an unemployed king comes in. there are more than 141 million objects, including james's body go, he would be surprised if he found out. 	if you want to see everything in the museum, put the batteries, it has to be fast. 	go ahead gadget turbo eyes. 	do not blink. 	it is easy to deduce why the smithsonian is also known as "the attic of north america," even though it is not crowded and the roof is not. did you know that the smithsonian is made up of 16 museums. 	would you believe there are three closets. 	this e museum of natural history, also known as and here is a very clean man, is called the soap man. 	this is a mummy of the years his body became soap after dying because he was buried in the ground is a phenomena will that be or is it that he had time to rinse when he bathed. 	this could be the world's largest pocket watch, the foucault pendulum. 	watch this to witness the tide's rotation, blame jean foucault because it was because of him and that brass ball suspended from the roof always swings through the same point in the middle, why hit and throw the wheel of dominoes. 	my computer gadget tells me that this is because the serum under the pendulum does not feel like it moving. 	i know, the ground does not move. 	the earth moves. 	imagine, these butterflies flew thousands of miles just to rest in the cute cabinets of the smithsonian's collection of insects. 	wait, that's not my tie. there's also a bone room where there are fossils including the bones of a nebraska camel from 20 years ago. i do not see the humps. 	now we are in the american history museum. 	look, it's the president teddy bear actually, this teddy bear is not a teddy by president teddy that's because one day roosvelt was out hunting and saved his life this is a sample of thomas edison is part of history he changed the whole world with their attempts, the dressers are also very edison also invented the phonograph, which is like a toilet but old disks. 	the national museum of aircraft and spacecraft is where you can learn about everything that flies, in the year 1927 charles limpbert made the first nonstop flight across the ocean to europe the spirit of take off from long island, new york, but the spirit of new york was not a good man for an airplane. 	especially if the donors who had paid the plane were had some problems, the fuel tank had to be installed in the place of the window to keep it limbert had to use a periscope by drawing the head out the side window to see. 	he probably kept his head out so he would not fall asleep. 	the flight lasted 33 hours and 30 minutes, more or less the same time it takes to get to the airport without traffic. 	this device resembles the kite of my greatuncle, he was flying in 1899, two brothers named orville and wilbur wright asked the smithsonian to give them all the information they had, which was very useful, because four years later they decided to fly this they cast lots to see who was flying it. 	wilber won and crashed in after fixing it, orville accepted his turn, and flew the ship until the book of this was the first manned airship to rise with its own force the ship rose 120 feet and lasted 12 seconds. 	the flight lasted less than that but so began the era of aviation. 	 how was the good named, fred was but james smith, was an englishman dedicated to learning. 	he died in 1829 and left a thousand dollars to the american government to be used for spreading knowledge. 	here i am, i am there are things that are not seen every day, unless this green area that divides the museums is called "but here i do not know if they think that all these places the tide, try to get on this one and look at those horses . 	if an irritated goat kicks them for being wrong they could land in the hirshorn museum, also belong here they have famous sculptures cast by famous artists like rodin, and many not very famous sculptures of not very famous artists of which we do not even know their hear, maybe i should say that some of these sculptures are my work. 	in hon to the african american heritage there is a whole museum dedicated to collecting the beautiful authentic art of is called the national museum and is another experience of this beautiful walk. 	the smithsonian could be the largest museum in the city, this is the national health museum we can appreciate the famous mask already know it, it is the one that appears on the five dollar bills. 	guess why this replica of lincoln's right hand is bigger than the one at that time lincoln's right hand swelled because of all the greetings he gave during his campaign. luckily his lips would have finished like everyone in washington, including the daughters of the revolution in the attic there are all sorts of old games for children, i go, this is a she is a 500 year old peruvian mummy that was discovered on an ice floe near a volcano. 	because it was on ice is perfectly preserved from the hair but from what is seen that day did not make up. 	juanita was part of an exhibition in the hall of the society of explorers and from personal experience i can tell you that it is easier to come to see the museum than to go to the cold volcano of peru. 	this is a cute little house, and i say small because it is a little doll house, in the museum of doll houses and everything is miniature, even this elevator which works. 	 have you ever been a why the heroic ships were the naval corral of washington, and the naval museum of retreat place for some venerable and victorious ships. where i am not even you can see my uncle had a periscope in a huge tub before he was attacked by a harmless rubber duck. 	 and now a trip data these are the pedal boats that everyone can enjoy in pedaling a pedal boat, or snacks a pedalea the faster they pedal, faster unless they forget to raise the anchor, in that case it would only be a kind of aerobics. 	do not retreat, buddies because there is still more fun with a completely different experience on our next trip from the gadget inspector. 	 we're back with the gadget inspector's trips, here on your planet u. 	] ehhh ... another one. 	pive, here i am the most "sponge." let me explain. 	it's not going to be any day ... 	it's going to get sticky, huh. 	that is all. 	 dawn ultra cleans more frets without the water feeling greasy. 	 that trickle ... 	tell me who's sending the message. 	 unlike other larger bottles with more water. 	dawn ultra has 30% more cleaning ingredients. 	thus you pay for its greaseremoving power and not for more water. 	 welcome che ... 	together we will be defaced. 	 dawn. more than you can imagine for your kitchen. 	time to run. 	hello. i am luis de sesame street. 	you are the first teachers of your children. 	make physical activity and eating healthy a part of your routine. 	they will feel better, and help their children stay healthy when they grow up. 	time to dance. 	they are the small steps we take each day that make the big difference. 	luis, you know what time it is now. 	what time is it. 	sssssss time '' now we continue with the trips of the gadget inspector, here on your planet u. 	 i'm the gadget inspector swimming in the sea of skyscrapers, and i'm not swimming to look at that, look at how much traffic. 	you do not have to be a detective to detect that we are in the famous big city of new york. 	let's go, go gadgetviajes. 	 located at the edge of the atlantic city of new york is formed of five bronx, brooklyn, ellys island, queens, and maniatan island. 	there are a large number of magnificent monuments and wonders in new york. 	from the top cubes in the chrysler building, the bulls on
