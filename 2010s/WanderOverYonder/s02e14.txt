"can you take my rabbit for a walk on tuesday."  "no way, bro. his leash is made of beefsteak, and that's not sanitary. i could make him a congressman instead, bro. " whew. nothing to worry about. they're only talking about weird stuff that doesn't make any sense.  what. what is it. no. oh, he's so smooth. well, i can dance, too.  he's not trying to woo her. he's demonstrating how he destroys planets with his planetdestroying parties.  no, he's doing a smooth dance, and dominator's gonna be super impressed, and they're totally gonna smooch.   where'd they go. probably to the smooching room. the smooching room.. i've mapped out her whole ship with a super scientific algorithm based on what i've seen of it so far. here's her inner sanctum, here's the war room, the arsenal, the smooching room, the bedroom, this part is mostly shoes and purses and stuff. the backup smooching room. sir, i seriously doubt an evil villain has a smooching room, let alone two. we've got six. sir, we've gotta get a closer look. one of us will have to sneak onboard her terrifying ship. watchdog: lord hater, it's an honor to be chosen for this mission. i won't let you down, i swear. all right, soldier, you're looking for a big, scary but beautiful lady lava villain. don't let her see you or you're doomed. and also a totally lame but thinks he's cool shark guy. yeah, watch out for him, too. if he sees you, you're also doomed. the bots. don't forget the bots. right, the bots. watch out for her army of literally thousands of killer bots. if they catch you, you're super doomed. got it.  uhhuh. on second thought good luck, soldier.   both: yes..  uh, jerry, stop shaking the camera and find the smooching room. it's down the passage on your left. there is no smooching room. look for the war room. see if you can find awesome's secret weapon. jerry, bots coming from up ahead. go back the way you came.  no, they're coming from behind you. rush forward in a blind panic.  zigzag, zigzag. run in a zigzag pattern. you'll be harder to shoot. run right at 'em. it'll totally confuse 'em.  jerry, get outta there. we didn't send you to spy on the inside of a closet. sh. listen. awesome: i'm tellin' ya, d, you're gonna go crazy for my secret weapon. it's gonna sweep you off your feet. i'm interested. tell me more about this secret weapon. both: this confirms my worst fears. wait, what.  jerry, stop crying. we can't hear anything.  no. what happened. come back. oh, his tears must've shorted out the camera. there's only one thing to do, sir. if we wanna know what's going on, we'll have to go see for ourselves. but how. okay, it looks like a left ahead. on my signal, and now. turn left. i said left, sir. left. my left or your left. we have the same left. do you know which way left is. what's that. it must be awesome's secret weapon. we can't let it reach dominator. gotta play this cool so as not to rouse suspicion. hater: hello, fellow fist fighter. what a lovely i'm taking this out.  left. no.. what. whoa, whoa, whoa.  there you are. finally. peepers: eep. o mighty lord dominator, we present to you emperor awesome's totally awesome top secret weapon, guaranteed to conquer the galaxy and your heart. peepers: oh, no, we were both right. they are taking over the galaxy together. and they are dating. peepers, what do we do. hey, babe, heard you were looking for a secret weapon. well, check out these guns. whoa. no. that's so cool. karate. let's get awesome. as you can see, i've set them to stun. huh. huh. oh, wow. oh, and i thought you were all talk. i didn't think you'd actually try anything. i'm impressed. oh, thank grop, you were right. they're just dating. there's no secret weapon. what a relief. now they're gonna smooch, get married, and have babies, and i'm gonna be alone forever. oh, you're not alone, sir. you have me and the watchdogs. who needs dominator anyway. why, if she can't see that you're really the greatest in the galaxy, then she doesn't deserve you. really. you think. of course. besides, i don't think there's gonna be any smooching. look. you know, when you showed up, i was, like, right, like i'm letting that scrub on my ship. but it was a slow day, no big planets to dominate, nothing but reruns on, so i figured, maybe he does have some kind of secret super weapon. at least it would be entertaining. but you know what. i never guessed what a pathetic waste of time you'd be. do you really think i'd let you ride my coattails to the top. ha. get real, buster. not even that idiot hater is as delusional as you. she knows my name. she called you an idiot. an idiot whose name she knows. don't be like that, babe. ccome on, what about all the good times. hey, take it easy, d. that's lord dominator, if you're nasty. baby, wait.. bots. she hates awesome and loves me. sir. hater's gonna date her, hater's gonna date her. oh, yeah, oh, yeah. sir.. yeah. she likes me.  sir, she's cold and heartless. i really don't think she wants to date anyone.  cold and heartless. you're just jealous. she's not so bad.  sir. come in, sir. you left me on dominator's ship.  oh, what's wrong with these guys. )
