lasers. our brains. doh. i have recently been experimenting with the extremely rare, extremely unstable isotope, frostonium 17. if we expose dominator to a blast of frostonium at close range, the subsequent exothermic process will boring. boring.. sir, this weapon will neutralize not only dominator, but her ship and entire army. yeah, but will it impress her. rock her world. get her lava flowing. no. the exact opposite. what.. just watch. oh, no. the powerful and beautiful dominator has conquered another planet. nobody in the galaxy is strong or hunky enough to stop me. ha ha ha.
