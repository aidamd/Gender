thing that guy was inspired by was us. i mean, green hat, orange fuzz. but where's the flapdrassin' heart and sincerity. but he actually took out a giant dom bot. and noooobody's been able to do that. even you. well, maybe this guy is too good to be true. we need to track this wandering dogooder. wander: huh. i thought i saw him take off towards flendar. there's the flendarians. there's another giant dom bot coming to destroy them and all they hold dear. but no hotshot.  no hotshot. oh, no. who will save them..  you know what. tromp that guy. if he can take down a dom bot, i can take down a

before that hotshot does. sylvia, are you jealous. of him. please. there's something phony in his bologna, and i'm gonna prove it. yeah.  he rides a hover speeder across the galaxy when dom bots come

heeyah. ahem. and also sylvia is also the best as well. there can be two bests. okay, i've triangulated the bot attacks, and if my calculations are correct, this planet is most likely the next target. finally, we'll be able to stop the hotshot i mean bots. stop the bots once and for all. okay, wander. wander.  once. sylvia, i'm the strong, silent type. pretend i'm not talking right now.  i don't know what you see in that guy. sure, he may be a little "grrr" for my taste, but he's stoppin' bots, helpin' folks, and makin' people happy. maybe we can learn a thing or two from him. now ssh.   oh, no, you don't. that bot is mine. hello, mr. hotshot. longtime follower. literally. i've been following you around all over the place. i've been trying to ask if you might like to team up and help us out. your hover speeder's really loud, and i don't think you can hear me. ow. ha. not so hot now, are ya.  okay, bot, prepare to   meet your doom.   bot: ah stop. get off. you're gonna damage the hardware. what.  you should see your face right now. it's all, like, "waaah, i'm so confused." enlighten me. uh, well, so, like, my cousin and i, we found this busted dom bot, and he sorta thought, why don't we fix it up. and i pretend to attack towns, and then he can rush in and save the day, and get the reward and smooch all the pretty ladies. smooch all the pretty ladies.  oh, no. wander: what's your favorite way to help. mine is every way. where you from. hey, who are you under this hat. get off me, wander. yeah, yeah, i know. gasp. brad starlight. you.. but why. because i am strong. i am a man. i have a big chin. i am the hero. me, me, me. this should be my thunder, and you and your dumb steed aren't gonna take it from me. brad, there's plenty of thunder. maybe there's a way you can still help us stop dominator. stop dominator.  simple jester. i can't very well help planets and smooch princesses if i'm dead, can i. but you're not actually helping. aha, quiet, girl. it never hurts to help yourself. chad. okay, take two. i'll go back to point a, you dispose of them, attack the town, i'll ride in, do the thing with the thing, and the money and the smooching, and the fame and the glory. good. go. who's the wandering hero now. ow. oh, my knee. my knee. shut up.  yeah, so, sorry about this, but, prepare to meet your doom, i guess. sylvia: oh, no. that's a real dom bot. wait, what. oh, i forgot. i have, like, a thing somewhere where there's not a real killer robot. later.  oh, poor bradley. he's so misguided and bad at things. that bot's gonna kill him. yep. sylvia.

shh. we're trying to do the strong, silent type thing. oh, yeah, sorry. brad: help. not the chin.  thank you. thank you. this was a hardwon victory, but under my guidance, even dumb animals and silly sidekicks can be taught to fight the forces of fright. yeah, thanks for the help. well, to the victor go the spoils, huh, hotshot. have you met the princess. brad: why, no, but who am i to deny a comely lass the honor of repaying my bravery with copious amounts of smoooo oh, no.  wander: aw. i think she likes him. yeah.  system updating. integrating frostonium capabilities. twentyeight percent
