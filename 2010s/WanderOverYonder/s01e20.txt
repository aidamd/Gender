don't worry, mr. and mrs. brittle. we'll have you and your family moved in no time. yeah. for such tiny little folks, you sure do have a ton of stuff. well, hope you love the new place, folks. remember, it's not just a house, it's a home. sylvia. we're not done yet. so mr. brittle's reading chair. i'm thinking third floor study. you're right. the east bedroom would get some good sun during the wintry months. wander, is it just me, or have our latest adventures lacked a certain element of, ya know adventure. i know just what you need, sylvia. we'll bust into hater's ship yeah. and give barry a birthday cake. barry. one of the watchdogs. turning 30. hasn't told anybody but hopes they remember anyway. poor barry. look, i'm all for helping. i could just use a little more i don't know, action. you. you. you. surrender now, thief, and your death will be slightly less painful. wait. you.. drat. these window treatments are just all askew. fortytwo. huh. huh. hm. huh.. oh, man. well, you ain't any lighter. and that saddle of yours sure ain't any softer. good thing i was around to save that ugly mug of yours. like i've ever needed help from your craggy old hide. oh, i can't believe it. i thought you were gone forever. takes way more than some flab drassit black hole to take me down. why didn't you let me know you were still alive, you narfin' frood. i tried, but for a tenfoot tall flarf narbler, you're mighty hard to track down. it is so great to see you again. it is great to see you, too. oh, grop. wander, i'm so sorry. i i gotcha, little guy. wander, this sorry son of a star chaser is my old partner. goes by the name of ryder. used to ride her. so you replaced me with a hairy chicken leg. oh, come on, he's not that bad. look, he likes you. any old friend of sylvia's is a new friend of mine. so why was hater trying to blast you into atoms. probably just because i stole the key to his hidden galactic storage station. the place he keeps all the loot he's stolen throughout the galaxy. i thought that place was a myth. oh. it's real, all right. now that i got the key, i just gotta find the location of the darn thing. oh, man, sounds like a real adventure. say, sylvia, you're the roughest, toughest, punchiest partner i ever had. you may just come in handy. you up for a riproaring, actionpacked, transgalactic adventure to break into hater's hidden storage station to steal the most priceless treasures in the entire universe. riproaring. top secret. actionpacked. count me in. right, wander. i don't know. break into. steal. sounds a bit dishonest, don't you think. oh, yeah. sorry, ryder. since you and i split, wander and i have been focused on helping others and doing good. not sure this is a job for us. uhuh, you didn't let me finish. how would you like to join me on a riproaring, actionpacked, transgalactic adventure to politely check in on hater's hidden storage facility and help return the universe's most priceless treasures to their rightful owners, thus making them happy. politely. helping. make people happy. whoohoo. oh, sorry. will you ii'll just see. room for both of us. don't worry about me. i can use the exercise. weasel's watering hole. i haven't been here in years. ah. brings back memories, don't it. word is, weasel knows how to find hater's hidden station. ready to ask him real nicelike if he wants to hand him over. asking real nicelike is my specialty. might i recommend starting with a small gift or cookie bouquet. well, well. together again. it's ryder and sylvia. howdy do. and, uh, weird little furry guy. i hear you're looking for hater's hidden station. information like that sure would fetch a pretty price. figured you might give us a discount, for old time's sake. excuse me, sir, but what if i told you you'd be helping a charitable endeavor. it might be taxdeductible. wander, why don't you go outside see if some folks need your help out there. oh, okay. sure. now, about those coordinates. ryder, i found some folks to help. that's great, buddy. in fact, they say they're friends of yours. they've been waiting for you to show up with that key to hater's station that you promised to get for them. so, now that you're all back together, you can give 'em the key, just like you promised. yeah, ryder. just like you promised. ryder, you doublecrossed the scuzz buckets for that thing. ninetyeight. you flab drassit glorf. that sure is a funny way to greet old friends. wah ain't forgot how to hotwire a cruiser, have you. it's for a good cause, remember. besides, we'll bring it back. i promise. spread out. ah. cover me. with a blaster, flab drassit. you know how to use one of these, right. zap, zap. zap, zap, zap. zapzap, zap. i'm sorry. is it more of a "pewpew" or a "bzz". ahh. on three, we pop up and return fire real fire, okay. one, two excuse me, opponents. we will soon be returning fire. i suggest ducking to avoid serious injury. thank you for your time. are you we're trying to injure them. why would we wanna do that. you stinkin' grofflezop. and we will return your ship undamaged, along with a fresh fruit basket. do you prefer honeydew or bingleberries. got the key, got the coordinates. not half bad for our first round back in the game. yeayeah. wander, i'm glad you wanna help, but ryder and i used to do this kind of thing all the time, so so maybe you should just leave this to the professionals. uhoh. we got company. grab the wheel so i can blast these bozos. you can count on me. i was, uh i was actually talking to ryder. i thought that was pretty obvious. is there anything i can do to help. yes, totally. just, um don't touch anything. sure hope your aim's improved since the shadow moon of landau. just try and keep up. quick update: have not put my hands on anything. the entire ship remains remarkably untouched. uh, ryder, we're heading toward a whole mess of stuff. i know. we're gonna crash right through it. and use the distraction to blast the last of these losers. nice. also, it'll look really cool. but what about not our problem, buddy. i have you now. sorry. pardon. excuse me. humblest apologies. fresh fruit. fresh fruit for sale. why aren't we moving. there you go. one crate of bingleberries, good as new. wander, what are you doing.. i was just thought i could help. we're in the middle of a highspeed chase here. why can't you be more like ryder. how we lookin'. not good. weapons are gone, so's the engine. only shelter nearby is that moon. that's no moon. that's hater's galactic storage facility. we made it. what do you think. number nine thousand, six hundred ninetynine. never tried one of those before. to time like the present. okay, i'm on it. tiny question. what does 9,699 mean. got it, chief. can i adjust the vector. you don't even know what that means. i can check the oil. just sit down. huh. that was awesome.. nothin' better than a riproarin' adventure, eh, sylvia, old girl. nope. nothin'. wow, guys, that was amazing. you two really do make a pretty good team. nice wait, where's wander. hm, i don't know. i lost track of him after that awesome space chase. am i right, partner. we should probably go find him. that little freaky furball. all he's done is get in our way. all right, all right. but let's finish the mission first. hater's main treasure room is just ahead. good grop. whoohoo. i'm rich. i'm so rich. i'm gonna buy a big galactic cruiser, and a little one to go inside the big one. ha ha. wait. you're rich. what happened to giving this stuff back to the people hater stole it from. please. you didn't really believe that, did you. you did. that little weirdo is turning you all kinds of soft. thank grop i came along. hey, just 'cause wander likes helping out doesn't make him soft. sure, it does. while he's out there givin' out free hugs or something, we're in here with all the treasure. we win. intruder alert. intruder alert. not good. what'll it be. number 19. number 46. i'm thinkin' number one. as in, lookin' out for. so long, syl. told you you'd come in handy. whoohoo. not good at all. now, wander, don't be selfish. if sylvia wants to have hardcore, violent, inconsiderate space adventures with a guy like ryder, you gotta let her. you'll just have to find another partner someone strong, and smart. and brave. someone who, though they act all tough, has a creamy center of gooey goodness. and when you inevitably get yourself into trouble in situations, they'll always find a way to get you out, no matter how bad things seem. look, fella, her and the little furry guy are who hater really want. let me go and i'll make a deal with ah. oh, i always forget what a jerk ryder was, and what a jerk he makes me. i let the only partner who's seen the good in me just wander away. flab drassit. i'm sure gonna miss the goofy little guy. the way he'd mess up a plan just to do something nice. and he'd always find some crazy way to get out of it. it's like he's magic. lady, i'm sorry you lost your dog or whatever, but nobody cares. sylvia. wander. what, how, who. remember that time on keeton 6 . when we helped the immensapede find his missing contact lens. turns out, this is his cousin. oh, sylvia, i know you and ryder are all tough and cool, and i'm often not, but are you kidding. you remember the time you busted into hater's secret storage unit on a giant space worm just to help your best friend. that was pretty cool. would you say us being friends is the greatest adventure of all. no, because that would be way too sappy. but i'm kinda thinkin' it. frederick, thanks so much for the advice. it totally worked. why, that's spectacular, wander. remember, acknowledging your differences can often make a relationship even richer. you know, he was gonna eat me. what is going on here.. oh, wander. why am i not surprised.. sorry about the mess. but i was asking a space worm about friendship and i don't care. seize them. what do ya think. number 9,042. number eleventyseven. just do your thing. barry. happy birthday, barry. dude, it's your birthday. you oughta celebrate you, barry. you're the man. can't keep stuff secret, man. barry was born. stop them. you're embarrassing both me and yourselves. dreadfully sorry, but i think i knocked over something rather important during my rampage. it seems the station will soon be, uh, well exploded. cheerio. back to the ship. runaway. stop her. well, time to go. just one more thing. curse you, wander. sylvia, i knew you'd come back, old buddy, old pal. you're just lucky my partner makes me a better person. no. my treasure. "and we will return your ship undamaged. " that old ship was all i had. whoohoo. i could've been so rich. aw, frood it. you win some, you lose some, righty, syl. so what's next. a grift, a scam, grand theft spaceship. i asked wander to come, too. i have a hustle that can use the little nert muncher. she'll be back. hello there. let's talk about your honesty issues. noooo. so, partner, what is next. help a multiarmed vetruvian with a pesky hangnail. find the missing corner of the rubikian puzzle planet. you destroyed all my stuff. for that, you will pay. possibly with money, but definitely with suffering. how's about a little adventure. hidy ho, sylvia. away. i hate you so much, wander. i love you, too. i hate you so much, wander. i love you, too. )
