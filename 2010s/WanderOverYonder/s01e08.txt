say congratulations, you finally caught us, commander peepers. most of your attempts to try and catch us are, please excuse my language, kinda stinky, but this plant thing is just amazing. it totally took us by surprise, we had no idea you were after us. and even though we're sad to be caught i am just so happy thinking about how proud lord hater will be of you. well, even though i am a miserable failure and that bounty hunter got all the glory, lord hater finally conquered the entire universe, and that that's good enough for me. commander peepers forget that. ah. they're mine. mine. all mine. i win. i win. and the bounty hunters lose. thanks for saving us from the bounty hunter, commander peepers. byedeebye. watch closely now. see what happens here. this is them, escaping and this is you, letting them escape. i know, sir, but ahah. pay attention. this is them. and this is you. them. you. getting away. letting them get away. you see where i'm going with this. i get it, sir. even so, i guess you learned your lesson about using bounty hunters, right. that i did, peepers, that i did. i didn't hire enough of them. agh. no. please, sir. no. no. no. ooh that's good, that's the perfect high end my torture mix was missing. agh, no. aw, yeah. agh, no. stop. stop. please. agh, no. ouch. ouch. 1x08b "the ball" i hope everything at our relaxatorium is to your liking. i'm so pleased you've enjoyed your stay on balzaria 9. we're quite fond of our peaceful home. well, time to flee and abandon it forever. huh. huh. beeza, what the heck is going on. oh, a thousand pardons, it's just that our entire planet is about to be destroyed. again. what.. on eight different planets, we've built our perfect civilization. and eight different times, we've heard the armageddon chimes, letting us know that he's come to destroy all we've worked so hard to build. it's pretty routine by this point. wait, what. who's he. we use to call him the worldbuster, but now most of us just call him buster. ah. the winds already. this doomsday is moving along quite briskly. huh. huh. you folks are abandoning your beautiful home for a new one. just like that. what. of course not. phew. there aren't any planets left in our system. we have absolutely no idea where we're going. we'll just fly through space until we run out of fuel. or food, whichever comes first. how does one fight off cannibals. some kind of pointy stick, i assume. everyone just hold up. y'all have put so much work into this pretty little planet. don't you want to try and save it. i know you're scared of buster. but if you keep running, that's all you're ever gonna be doing. you have a chance to change that. you just have to turn and face your problems head on. what do you say. eh, sure. whatever. that's good enough for me. now gather round. i have a plan. we got his attention. time for phase two. we did it. here's to facing your problems head on. huh. hey, not bad. what do you know. i did not think i was gonna win. uh folks what happened.. i thought it worked. flarf nabbit, it did work. we threw a dog a bone and he fetched it. oh, darn. the sticky rains of terror. we've lingered far too long. come on. time to flee. wander, buddy, we tried, but these folks seem okay with just getting out of here. maybe we should be too. nawuh. no way. i have one more plan. everybody. one more plan. one more plan. one more plan. one more plan. all right, soldiers. on my mark present weapons. wet whistle. deep breaths. and blow... it's working. don't stop now. hey, bad dog. ahahah. wait. new plan. everybody. wait. new plan. new plan. new much better plan. everyone. all new and improved plan. trash. everybody. hit that tongue with the grossest, nastiest, worsttasting garbage you can find. wha why didn't it work. wander, don't you get it. dogs love trash. but, but sorry buddy, it's time to go. but, but oh. hey, you guys made it. that's great. go, go, go, go, go. so we didn't get a win this time. but wander, sometimes a problem is so big, you just have to flee. no. there's only one way to stop this once and for all. come on, what are you what's going on. where's wander. that little kamikaze's heading straight for that monster. wander. i know you're upset that buster ate the planet. heck, so are the rest of these folks. eh, we'll get over it. but destroying him and us is not the answer. we have to flee. that's what i'm doing. i'm facing this problem head on... head on. yeah. have you lost your nut. do you realize what you just did. without that ship, these folks have nowhere to live. they needed some place safe from buster with trees and fresh air and places for really great spas. and and huh. oh, wander. thanks to you, we finally have a permanent home. yeah. see, y'all always wanted to flee. but it turns out, all you really needed to do was flea. flea. flea. you know, bzzt like the bug. 'cause they're living on the dog. look, if you have to explain the joke mewmewmewmew, mewmewmeow )
