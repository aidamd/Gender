over yonder don't, don't. don't you do it, binglebop. don't you dare fall to dominator. no. no.  noooo.. ohou. she did it. dominator destroyed every single planet in the flarpin' galaxy. there's nothing left to conquer. what are we gonna do now, sir. sir. sir. we're finished.  they lost. i did it. i played this stupid galaxy like a fiddle, and then smashed that fiddle across their dumb little faces. ha. come on, is this a party or a funeral. well, i guess it's kind of a funeral for them. still, show a little excitement.  activate celebration protocol omega. we'll work on that. but i'm not gonna let you sadsack robozos rain on my parade, because i came, i saw, and i dominated. there's nothing left of this stupid galaxy. there's nothing left. no more dopey little planets to destroy. no more annoying adorable idiots to antagonize. it's over. activate sympathy protocol sigma. there, there. it will all be all right. look, a shooting star. ha. aw, it's not the same. what i wouldn't give for one more planet to destroy. king bingleborp. i'm so glad you made it. welcome to our little secret hideaway. can we get you anything. vengeance. dominator destroyed my planet. my people have fled the galaxy. i want to know exactly what you heroes intend to do about it. cheer up, your bingleness. we've got some of the smartest, bravest, and overall bestest folks in the galaxy here to figure out how to stop her. sylvia: everybody, hello. ooh, we're starting. better find our seats. ugh. hello, everyone. i'm sylvia. whoo. sylvia. all right. we've invited you here because, well, there's no place else. dominator has driven us from our homes and kept us on the run for an entire season of our lives. well, i'm done running. i'm making a stand on this tiny rock so small and far away that even dominator can't find it, here at i feel like that was a poor choice of words. this is our galaxy. and no hotheaded, coldhearted psycho is gonna take it from us.  um, yeah. what's your plan exactly. ii am open to suggestions. we should consult the mighty wizard neckbeard the allknowing naysayer. yeah, tried that. didn't work. could've told 'em it wouldn't. legend tells of an ancient battle mech known as robomechabotatron. yeah, we kinda sorta blew that up.  whoa. that is that is dark. yeah, we're not doin' that. why don't we just cozy up down here until this dominator bird gets bored and hits the bricks. and let her do the same thing to another galaxy. no way. this stops now. major threat, you used to be one of the worst villains around. a true galactic terror. what should we do. i don't know, man. all this heavy stuff is really bumming me out. hey, who's up for pizza. i want anchovies. half pineapple. no pineapple.  no wonder dominator was able to take over this galaxy. lord hater. barry. andy. anybody. listen up, watchdogs. to the untrained eyeball, it may seem as though dominator has won. wrong. i have done careful research, and using my extensive knowledge of gravity wells and thermodynamics his what now. i have uncovered this a class d planetoid emitting a minimal gravitational pull, allowing it to go undetected by dominator, which means there's one planet left. there is. and guess who's on it.  oh, great. we will use wander as a distraction in order to conquer the planet, turning our greatest weakness into our greatest strength. we will. dominator may have destroyed every other planet, but as long as there is hate in my bones, she will never get this one. this is where we make our stand, and let her know that she failed because this planet, nay, this galaxy, belongs to the duke of destruction, the monarch of mayhem, the greatest in the galaxy, lord hater. hate's great. best villain. hate's great. best villain. watchdogs, eyes up. we've got a galaxy to save. so we can conquer it later. where has this guy been all season of our lives. hate's great. best villain. hate's great. best villain.  hello. ahem. yoohoo, hey. over here. hi.  hi, everybody. i know you're all upset, but taking it out on each other won't help anything. sure, dominator's cut a brutal swath of chaos and destruction throughout our galaxy, but if she gets us to turn on our friends, then we've really lost. a planet's just a place you hang your hat. as long as we've got each other, we've still got a shot.  together, there's nothing in the galaxy we can't do. all: yeah. so, what are we gonna do. all: destroy dominator. yeah wait, what now. destroy dominator. whoa, whoa, whoa. resheath that sword. undraw those guns. deflex those pecs. i don't wanna destroy anybody. sylvia, help me out here. sylvia. i i'm sorry, buddy. but i thought we were gonna figure out how to stop her from being so evil. there's gotta be a reason she's so mean. if we could just figure that out. an enemy's just a friend you haven't made yet. right. sometimes an enemy is just an enemy. thanks, but we'll handle it from here. okay, starbella, ripov, major threat, you've all got ships. the baa'haalans have an army. neckbeard's got tons of magical weapons and stuff. it's a bold move, but someone's gotta do it.  dumb. stupid. sigh. boring. suggested course of action: dominate another galaxy.  but that means starting from scratch. meeting a bunch of new people, figuring out the right way to crush their spirits.  demolishing this galaxy was my masterpiece. it was so full of dorks ripe for the dominating. where am i gonna find anyone as dumb and hopeful and pathetic and  perfect.  wander: um. hello. dominator. i wanted to stop by, have a chat, is this a bad time. dominator: bots, stand down. you're not gonna have them destroy me. no. ah, see. i knew you weren't all bad. i'm going to destroy you. run. what the what now.   pete, man the torpedo tubes. ted, prepare eye fighters for launch. captain tim, heel, sit. good boy. sir, you're on point, you're formulating strategies. you actually know the watchdogs' names. this is incredible. no, peepers. this is incredible. activate skull crusher mode. here comes the skull crusher whoa. peepers, no time for distraction. we need to focus on getting our galaxy back. are you crying.  no, sir. barry, jerry, punch it.  hey, get back here. what fun is you running in terror if i don't get to watch you run in terror. i just wanna get to the root of your pain. maybe hug it out. ow.  sylvia, oh, thank grop. we gotta get outta here before sylvia. noooo.  the look  on your face. "sylvia, no." thought your friend dead.  why are you like this. ha ha. just lucky, i guess. i'm serious. everyone else is out there trying to destroy you. but i figure there's good way deep down in everyone. there's gotta be some reason you're so grop darned evil all the time. if you just tell me what's ailin' ya, maybe i can help you out. what do ya say. really. you mean it. of course i do, because i believe an enemy is just a friend you haven't made yet. wow. i gotta thank you for letting me know there's more of you idiots out there to destroy. what. no. you said everyone else was trying to destroy me. that means they're still out there. where are they. they're nowhere. i mean, there's no one anywhere. even if there was, it's not like they're secretly hiding out and plotting your demise. it's just little old me, so you better hurry up and destroy me now please. thank you. bots, scan him. shut up. there's another planet to dominate. and it's full of your weird little pals. oh, this is just the cherry on top i was looking for. but i just wanted to help you. oh, you were a big help. "friend. " okay, rebels, what are we gonna do. all: destroy dominator. how are we gonna do it. destroy dominator. sorry. yeah. yeah, no, i get that. love the enthusiasm. but how.. we need a plan. we can't waltz up and punch her ship, you know. wander, you've snuck onto her ship more than anyone. do you have any bright ideas. wander. wander.  where could he have gone. there's no place left in the galaxy except  oh, no. hey, guys, how's it going. guess who i found. wanna say hi. hi. wander. oh, thank grop you're still okay. i was so worried about you. i was worried you'd be worried. well, i was worried that my worry would worry you. i was worried enough. you should all be worried.  hater: no. it is you who should be worried, lord dominator. huh. hatey. you can steal my planets, you can capture my enemy, you can even break up with me. you realize we were never dating. you wanna destroy my galaxy. you gotta get through me first. well, that was weird. where was i. oh, yeah.  all: phew.  phew. phew. phew. phew. please stop this. it's terrible, and emotionally exhausting. okay, let's get down to business. and i know just where to start. grab the zbornak. no. flabdrassin' tin cans. i destroy your best friend, then i watch you cry.  who is the universe's ultimate evil doer. hater. hater. all: hater. an enemy is just a friend you haven't made yet. you guys saved my life. don't get used to it. this is a onetime stop the badder bad guy thing. all right. how is this idiot doing this. he's a terrible bad guy. but he makes a pretty good good guy. i think i see a crack in your armor. that's it. this ends now. i'm doing it. i'm actually winning. we're all very impressed. what exactly do you think is gonna happen here. um, i'm gonna stop you. ha. please. even if you could, you'd still be a joke. the lamest in the galaxy. just a dopey, softcentered jerk that nobody has ever, or will ever, respect. face it. you are literally the worst villain ever. hate's great. best villain. hate's great. best villain. all: hate's great. best villain. hate's great. best villain. hate's great. best villain. hate's great. best villain. hate's great. best villain. hate's great. best villain. hate's great. best villain. raaaah.  whoa. how is this happening. they're just a bunch of goofy idiots. bots, help me. fine. i don't need you. i don't need anybody. that's silly. everybody needs somebody.  that's it. you need us. i have sylvia, lord hater has peepers and the watchdogs. but you're all alone up here. shut up. i got lots of friends. bot 79, bot 108, bot 13.  no, wait, i blew up bot 13. shut up. i've got lots of friends. you could've destroyed us when you first showed up. when we put on that concert for you, heck, you spent a whole night out with syl. but you didn't because you like hanging around us. even if it is in a "rrrr, grr, i'm gonna kill you" way. stop it. just stop talking. that's why you're such a bully. you're lonely.  i'll destroy you.   wander.  wh what. why did you save me. ii tried to kill you, like, a lot. because an enemy's just a friend you haven't made yet. and there's a whole bunch of potential friends down there. sure, you sorta tried to destroy 'em, so there'll be a few awkward dinner parties, but if they can cheer for him, they can accept anybody. you realize i, like, demolished your entire galaxy. you'd be surprised what you can grow from a little bit of kindness. it's never too late for a fresh start. so, let's try this again. hello to you. folks call me wander. that's my pal sylvia. welcome to the galaxy. we hope you'll accept our humble gift of friendship. shut up. ugh. you guys are so weird. i'm leaving. didn't wanna destroy your goofy little galaxy anyway. you're all a bunch of dorks. i'm taking this 'cause i'm hungry, not 'cause we're friends. buddy, i am so sorry i doubted you. you were totally right. well, i don't know about that. i really thought i could make a new friend. i think you may just yet. peepers: you did it, sir. you saved the galaxy. a galaxy of new planets. for me. to conquer. starting with this one.  or it's a whole new galaxy for us to explore. come on, buddies.  we're not your buddies. peepers and sylvia: nothing ever changes. duh. come on. stupid friendship orange. ugh. dumb peel. bunch of dorks. they'll get what's coming to them.  )
