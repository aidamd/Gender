  act 1 <2:49>  yuma: astral. where are you..  yuma: hang on, astral.  yuma : i'm on the way. orbital: ohh, i've got to stop yuma before this spins outta control.  <3:00> orbital: better call for backup. calling orbitals five and sixbash those brats..   yuma: guess we can't go *this* way.  kazwell: or *that* way.  tori: this welcoming party doesn't look too friendly.  bronk: get outta here, yuma. yuma: huh. bronk: we'll keep these bots busy so you can go rescue astral.  yuma: but, bronkahh.  kazwell: hey. blockhead.  cathy: you sure gave that bot the boot, kazwell.  kazwell: hm. go ahead, yuma. we'll handle 'em. <4:00> tori: now, go get your key. yuma: thanks, you guys.  kazwell: take *that*, ya big bug. when we run outta shoes, we'll *sock* ya.    kite: those lifepoints are running out quickly, my foolish friend. your time is almost up. astral: ugh.... kite: i place a card facedown, and end my turn.  kite: hesitating. why botheryou'll lose no matter *what* you do. astral: ah...  we shall see. *i* draw.  astral : none of my defensive moves have *worked* against kite. i wonder what *yuma* would do now.  yuma: no.  letme..   cathy: quick..  <5:00>   orbital: they're *still loose*.. okkayno more mister nice bot.  orbital: heh heh heh heh heh... kite: i'm waiting. are you *going to make a move*, or *not*. astral : i know *exactly* what yuma would do in this duel. i must *feel the flow*.  i summon zubaba knight.  zubaba knight: zubabaaaa *knight*.. astral: next i send this card to the graveyard , to summon acorno.  acorno: goodie. astral: and then i'll activate the spell card "drop exchange". now if i send two or more monsters to my graveyard, i can summon a monster from my hand, whose level is equal to their total. so by sending levelthree zubaba knight and levelone acorno to my graveyard, i can bring out, kagetokage.  <6:00> astral: as you see, i now have two levelfour monsters on my field. kite : i hope you're about to do what i think you are.  astral: i overlay levelfour gogogo golem and kagetokage, in order to build the overlay network, and xyzsummon, number thirtynineutopia.    yuma: ugh. not more *firewalls*. i can't hack this security system..  yuma: huh. that looks like *kite*... except he seems a lot happier... who's that *other kid*.   yuma: huh.  deep voice: yuma tsukumo, have you the courage. light voice: courage... yuma: courage for what. deep voice: enter the door <7:00> and you shall gain new power beyond anything you imagine. light voice: enter the door... deep voice: but to balance this power, you must sacrifice that which is most important to you. light voice: sacrifice... deep voice: there is one who stands in your way, however. light voice: one who stands.... deep voice: use your skill to defeat this threat. light voice: defeat.... deep voice: now, if you dare, enter this door. light voice: now... dare... enter... deep voice: enter and obtain the power of zexal. light voice: power of zexal....  yuma: the power of zexal.... act 2 <7:30>  kite: your utopia will soon be mine.  astral: you are gravely mistaken.  utopia. attack photon leo, with rising sun slash.  kite: nice trybut your plan won't work, because i have the trap card "armored back". <8:00> know what it does. it lets me bring back the monster you just destroyed. so welcome back to the duel photon leo.   astral : he needs two monsters with at least two thousand attack points...  astral : ...so that he can tribute them and summon galaxyeyes photon dragon.  astral : *i must be ready*.  ha.  astral: i end my turn. yuma: zexal....  yuma: huh..  orbital: *hold it right there*, ppipsqueak.  orbital: surrender now. oror *feel my fury*.  yuma: you're that *minimech*.  orbital: i*i* am orbital *seven*.  orbital: aand when i get angry, i have a *huge temper*.  yuma: uuuih. daaaaaaaahhhh.. orbital: who's 'mini' *now*. <9:00>  orbital: little ppest. this is how we deal with ttrespassers.  orbital: i got carried away... i ccan't get unstuck. help me out here, pal. wwe'll call a truce.  orbital: heystop. kite: *my* draw.  kite: i play photon circle.   astral: that monster only has one thousand attack points. there are *not enough points* to summon galaxyeyes. kite: that's what *you* think. i activate the effect of my equip spell, "photon spear".  kite: now when a monster equipped with photon spear is tributed to summon another monster, it counts as *two*. astral: as *two*.. kite: know what that meansit means *trouble*. ahahahahahahahaha.  kite: i summon galaxyeyes photon dragon. <10:00>  kite: go, galaxyeyes. blast utopia with photon stream of destruction. and now i activate its special ability. *say so long*, 'cause that means *both* monsters are now *banished*.  astral: ugnph. kite: and that leaves you *totally vulnerable*. okay, photon circle, you're up. attack him directly..  kite: now that i'm done attacking, galaxyeyes and utopia return to the field.  kite: but your nightmare isn't over. because thanks to galaxyeyes' special ability, it absorbs utopia's overlay units, *and*, it gains five hundred attack points *for each one*.  astral: four thousand attack points. kite: and next i'm activating the spell "galaxy storm". <11:00>  kite: this card lets me obliterate one xyz monster that has *no overlay units*.  kite: utopia's*gone*. astral: i activate, "xyz reflect". when an xyz monster is threatened by an effect, this trap card *negates* that effect, and strikes at you with eight hundred points of damage.  kite: hunh....  kite: impressive, but not *impressive enough*. you forgot something. your utopia's powerless against my galaxyeyes. astral: perhaps so. but you may be in for an unpleasant surprise. once again, *i draw*. now you will see, utopia's true form.  astral: since i have less than one thousand lifepoints, i can draw on utopia, and call forth chaos number thirtynine. utopia ray.  astral: go, chaos xyz evolution.    kite: no *way*... a *chaos* number. i had *no idea* numbers have this power. ugh... but it's too bad for you it has less attack points than my galaxyeyes. astral: that does not matter. it has yet *another* target. utopia ray, wield your special ability. watch as it gains five hundred attack points by using one overlay unit.  astral: go. overlay charge.  astral: and now, your photon circle loses one thousand attack points.  astral: it is time. utopia ray, destroy photon circle. <13:00> with rising sun chaos slash.  astral: it is over.  astral: but i thought. kite: that you had *beaten* me. when you attacked my photon circle, i only took half the damage i was supposed to take because of its special ability.  astral : he seems nearly indestructible....  i am placing one card facedown, and ending my turn.  kite: looks like you're in trouble *now*. watch out. i *draw*..  kite: prepare to suffer the rage of galaxyeyes, and its photon stream of destruction.  astral: i activate the trap card "clean barrier clear force". this card *clears* your attacking monster of its powers, and restores galaxyeyes to its original attack points, reducing the damage i take. <14:00>  astral: this is one duel you *will not win*, number hunter. no matter what attack you throw, i *will* block you. aagh.  kite: you're still in this duelbut *not for long* with only four hundred lifepoints. one more attack and you'll be *finished*, and your numbers will finally be mine.  astral: mmh... yuma.... act 3 <14:29>  yuma: aah. my golden key.  yuma: i hope astral's okay.  astral : i'm almost out of lifepoints....  astral : *and* out of time. farewell, yuma....  astral : i am glad to have known you... huh..  astral : what is happening to me..  yuma: somethin' must be goin' on inside the key. <15:00> listen, astral. i'm here to help. astral..  yuma: you there, astral. gimme a signwaahhh.   yuma: here.... *again*. deep voice: it has come. light voice : it has come...  deep voice: the time for you to decide. light voice: to decide.  deep voice: enter the door and gain the new power that is your destiny. light voice: enter the door, gain the new power...  yuma: rrgh. deep voice: but remember. the power will only be granted *if you sacrifice* that which you hold most dear.  light voice: most dear... sacrifice... deep voice: are you ready for the challenge. light voice: ready for the challenge... yuma : aaaaaaastral...  astral : *yuma*. yuma, is that you.. yuma: that's right. i sensed that you might need help. you're dueling against kite, aren't you. astral : yes, yuma. but i fear it is too late for help. my lifepoints are running out. yuma: no. just hang on. <16:00> i'm comin' to help you, astral. astral : *stay there*, yuma. yuma: huh.  astral : this world is very different from yours. i am not sure it is safe for you here. in any case, this fight is mine alone. yuma: that's not true. you *can't* go it alone. astral*listen*.. don'tcha see, we both need each other.   yuma: it's zexal.  astral: huh..  yuma: zexal is the power i need. once i've got that power i can help *you*. astral : ... what do *you* know about zexal. yuma: nothing, reallyjust what the *door* told me... astral : zexal is a miraculous power that will save my world. yuma: i *will* get the power. i promise. i'll do whatever it takes to save you, because we're a team..  yuma: together we're gonna highfive the sky...   <17:00>  astral: it is my turn. i will now build the overlay network with my friend yuma..  astral: two mighty forces will fuse into one, revealing the power of zexal. now, yuma.. yuma: let's feel the flow..  astral: zexalmorph.  kite: what's going on. what *is* that..  act 4 <17:56>  yuma: aaahh. what the *huh*. ah. yah. what's with the *getup*.  astral : when two distant souls become onethe power of zexal is revealed.  kite: wait a minutethat's yuma. somehow he got jumbled up with the other one.  kite: *but*even *combined* you only have four hundred lifepoints.  yuma: are ya sure it's *that few*. astral : we *can win this*, yuma.  astral : it all depends on this next card. astral: you must tap into your *heart* during this draw. believe in your cards. it is the only way you can pick the one we need right now. astral : focus, yuma. yuma : all right. ready, astral..  yuma: by the power of zexal, give me the wisdom and skill to draw the perfect card and defeat my opponent.  go, shining draw.  <19:00> yuma: appear, zexal weapon unicorn spear.    yuma: and now that utopia ray's equipped with unicorn spear, we're gonna gallop to *victory*.  yuma: with an extra nineteen hundred attack points, utopia ray is more powerful than your galaxyeyes photon dragon. kite: huh. you still can't defeat me.  astral: when utopia ray is in possession of a unicorn spear, it negates your monster's ability to flee the field. there will be *no escape* for your galaxyeyes.  yuma: go... hah. unicorn strike.  kite: i play "photon shock".. <20:00> the power of *this* trap activates when you attack my photon monster.  kite: as a result we both take the same amount of damage. yuma: huh.  yuma: a draw. that means you *can't* take my numbers, *or* my soul, kite. *all this trouble*, for nothing. why d'you even *hunt* numbers, anyway. well.. answer me.  kite: i do it, because it's the only way i can save my little brother. yuma : brother.  yuma: the kid i saw before.... but why d'you need *numbers* to help your brother.  kite: shark can have this back. yuma: his soul.. you're really returning it.  <21:00>  shark: ugh... mr. kay: finally awake, huh.  shark: what's going on. mr. kay: you've been asleep a long time, shark. but i think yuma just woke you up.  shark: *yuma*....  show tori and bronk running down one hall, cathy and kazwell down another, and orbitals 5 and 6 still elsewhere in the
