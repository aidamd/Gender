the right one this mornin'. and *this here is why*.  bronk: it's starting. the *world duel carnival*. tori: *that* explains it. bronk: yeah, you bet it does, tori, this is gonna be the best duel tournament ever thrown. kazwell: due in *no small part* to what the duelists could win.  kazwell: not only will the winner be immortalized as a champion for all of time, but they get a free lifetime pass to heart land.  flip: and you'll *really* flip when you hear the next part. mister heartland *himself* has promised to grant the tournament winner *one wish*, and make it come true no matter *what* it takes. tori: *really*.. flip: i already *know* my wish. it's gonna be to wish for a *hundred more wishes*. how smart is *that*.  kazwell: maybe you should just wish for a less goofy hat. cathy: *i* know what *i'd* wish fora date with *yuma*.  tori: so, who here's competing. flip: better believe *i* am, *see*. <3:00> tori: what's *that* thing.  flip: it's a heart piece. it's whatcha need to gain entry into the duel carnival. i got mine in the mail just this week.  kazwell: me, too.  bronk: me, three.  tori: so, *everyone's* in this. yuma: not everyone...  kazwell: huh. whaddayou mean. surely *you're* competing. yuma : who, me. i'm passing. tori: since when do *you* pass on dueling. yuma : sincetoday.  yuma: when the postman rode right past my house *without giving me that heart piece*... now the only flow i feel is the flow of *tears*.. astral: yuma... please, you are embarrassing me. and i am invisible. yuma: that's how *i* feel. invisible to the *world*. tori: i don't get it. why would you be the only one left out. bronk: yeah...  tori: does *astral* have any idea what might've happened. astral: they probably require all entrants to have some *skill*. yuma: kick a guy while he's down, why don'tcha. will someone please give me a huuuuuuug.  kazwell: yuma, you *did* apply for the event, right.  yuma : apply. <4:00> kazwell: yeah. you know. fill out the online app for entry. yuma : online app. kazwell : like *this one here on the website*.  kazwell: don'tcha see the *giant icon to apply*. yuma : is that what that's for. i kinda thought it was just a *cool little picture*... heheh... bronk: *it is*... a *picture* showin' you *how to apply for the tournament*. yuma: oh. tori : it could've happened to anyone...  tori: ...actually, *no*. this would only happen to *you*, yuma.  astral: at least now you will not have to embarrass yourself.  tori: *yuma*... yuma: huh. tori: *quit moping*. just apply *right now*. yuma: oh. good thinking.  yuma: it just wants my *name*, then my *address*, andvoila.  yuma: i'm all set. mr. heartland : thank you for applying. but registration is closed. yuma: what.... mr. heartland : snooze you lose. try again *next year*.  yuma: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh.  tori: yuma. what're you doing..  yuma: running from my problems. waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh.  yuma: uuuaaauuaaaauuuuuggghhhhhuh. shark: yuma. what in the world're you *doing*. yuma: what's it look like i'm doingi'm *totally freaking out*. shark: lemme guess. this has to do with the tournament. yuma: yeah. you wouldn't happen to have an extra one of those *heart pieces*, wouldja. shark : 'fraid not. in fact i don't even have one for *me*. yuma: what.  shark: the only person *i* duel for now, yuma, is myself.  yuma: *cool*. shark: later.  yuma: later, shark.  tori: yuma.  tori: ...shark. yuma: that's right.   quatro: long time, no see, reginald.  quatro: i'm sorry. everyone calls you 'shark' now, don't they. hmhmhm. shark: that's right.  shark: what's the *duel card* supposeta mean. quatro: i simply thought it might come in *handy* in the duel carnival.  shark: i'm not *entering* the tournament. quatro: oh, *my*.  quatro: you're still holding onto that old *burden*, aren't you. shark: what *burden*. quatro: perhaps a story will *jog your memory*.  quatro : it takes place during the finals of a duel tournament...  quatro : where you spied on your opponent's deck, and were then disqualified.  quatro : you *do* remember your *opponent*, don't you.  quatro : it was me.  shark: *so*. quatro: so there was more to your spying than just *wanting to win*, correct.   reginald.... at the finals... promise me... that you'll win. win for me. you need to.  quatro: i don't blame you. <7:00> you wanted to win *so badly* for her.  quatro : how could you resist my *conveniently* placed duel deck.  quatro: why, it's *almost as though that deck was left out on purpose*. shark: huh. you mean..  shark: you set me up.  shark: why, you...  quatro: what's done is done. heheheheh. and that includes your *duel career*.  quatro: because ever since that day you've been a *noname nobody*. whereas *i* have been winning trophy after trophy on the duel circuit. that must make you feel like... a *loser*. shark: no. i'm *not*.. quatro: so then *prove it*, *reginald*.  quatro: face me in the world duel carnival. ... if you dare. hehehahahahaha...  shark: oh*i dare* all right.. act 2 <7:56>  <8:00>  quatro: reginald will be participating in the world duel carnival just as you wished.  vetrix: excellent. i *knew* you wouldn't let me down.  quatro: of course. but still, i *must ask*. does he *really matter*. he's but an empty shell now.  vetrix: perhaps. but he still has a part to plaay. all will become clear once i've gathered the numbers.  vetrix: you'll see. quatro: very well. until theni'll just enjoy putting shark through the wringer again. heheheh.  yuma: pleeeeease, i'm begging you. you have no idea what this means to me.  yuma: you have to let me in the tournament. receptionist : i'm afraid there's nothing i can do, young man. but thank you for stopping by.  yuma: no, you don't understand.. this is a matter of life andandand me being so heartbroken i can't go on. <9:00>  yuma: ohh, yup, uhoh, here it comes.  my vitals are slowing... my body can't take it.  receptionist : all right, then. have a very nice day.  yuma: nice day..  yuma: how can i have a nice day if i'm *not in the duel carnival*.. come on, gimme a heart piece. pleeease. kazwell : you certainly have to give him points for perseverance.  airport loudspeaker: welcome to all duel carnival travelers. baggage claim is on the lower level and all ground transportation can be found in terminal a.  airport loudspeaker: please enjoy your stay here in our fair city, and good luck in the tournament.    <10:00>  computer voice: heart land city population has increased by one hundred and fiftyeight percent, and continues to increase every hour. nistro: did you hear that. duelists are coming in by the *droves*.  nistro: this is better than we *hoped*. ohoho. heheh. dextra : are all city systems online.  robots: security systems are online and operational.  robots: network transmissions are online and operational.  robots: all service bots are online and operational.  nistro : you hear that.. we're *all good*. dextra: all of us except for *you*, nistro. nistro: what..  dextra: just because things are running smoothly *now* doesn't mean they'll stay that way. we *must stay sharp*. nistro: hmph. i'm as sharp as they come. but *you*you're the dullest knife in the drawer. you're lucky i'm here to pick up your *slack*, dextra. dextra: oh, please.  mr. heartland: that's *enough*, the both of you.  if this is going to work, we need to work *together*. hm.  mr. heartland: ahhh, *kite*. <11:00> i've been *waiting* for you.  kite: why'd you call me here, heartland. i have *things to do*. mr. heartland: yes, i know you're busy. but not so busy that you can't behold the spectacle, the glory that is the world duel carnival.  mr. heartland: look at them all. so happy. so excited, so completely and utterly *clueless*. they have no idea, the only reason we've assembled them here, is to snatch their number cards. and when i say *we*, i mean *you*. after all, you're the one that doctor faker is counting on most, you know... *don't* let him down. after all, there are many powerful duelists competing.  nistro: well ya know what *i* say. bring 'em on. whatever numbers *kite here* can't take, i'll be *more* than happy to nab.  kite: appreciate the offer, but i've got this. nistro: see. *he's* full a' confidence. just like *me*. dextra: 'cause *he's* *earned it*.  nistro: ugh... mister heartland.  there's a young duelist without a heart piece who wants to compete. mr. heartland: and i should care *why*. <12:00> becausehe's been at the city gate since quite early this morning, and i don't think he's going *anywhere* anytime soon.  yuma : pleeease. i'll give you my entire life savings for a heart piece, that's almost seventyfive cents.  kite : it's him. mr. heartland: send in more security. take him *away*. right.  kite: hold it. let's let the little rat participate. mr. heartland: you *know him*. kite: no... but you never know who might have a number card these days.  mr. heartland: i sayare you sure you're not *hiding* something, kite.  mr. heartland: the other day, there was a mysterious explosion at a heart land facility. kite: i dunno anything *about that*. all i care about, is gathering numbers. now, please excuse me. i have to go and prepare for the tournament. mr. heartland: *you're excused*.  orbital: master kikite, why didn't you report that *yuma* was involved with that blblast. kite: *quiet*, or i'll power you down permanently. orbital : sir. quieting down. kite : the only one i'm focused on... <13:00>  kite : is *astral*.  kite: and i *will* have my revenge on him. orbital: uhh, you're not still talking about *me*, are you. kite: as for *yuma*, he is *harmless*...  orbital: really. harmless. kite: ...except to himself.  yuma: i am not leaving here until somebody gives me a heart piece. i'm not kidding. i'm a kid tori: wow, several hours and yuma's *still going strong*. bronk: yeah...  yuma: whoa, what's this..  tori: whoa, no *way*.... kazwell: is that mister heartland. flip: it just *can't* be.  yuma: hey, dude.  mr. heartland: 'hey, *dude*'..  tori: not a good start. <14:00>  *mister*. it's *mister* heartland. yuma : 'mister'. then what do they call his *dad*.  *say it*.  yuma: fine. hey, missus heartland. *mister*..  yuma: oh, right, sorry. mister. it's just, when i look at the color of that suit, i think, missus, no offense. heheh.  yuma: anywaynow that i gotcha here, i was wondering if *maybe* you could hook me up with a heart piece, pretty please. kazwell: yuma should really pick his words more carefully. bronk: i agree. it's just that he doesn't have that many to *choose* from. mr. heartland : my *dear boy*. i have heard your plight. which is why i've decided to come here *personally* and give you mr. heartland: *this* small giftheads up.  yuma: ah. a heart piece. i've finally got one. now i get to compete. thankyou thankyou *thank you*...  mr. heartland: *what* is that *pendant* there. yuma: whatthis. mr. heartland: it has a unique shape. yuma: i guess. it was a gift from my mom and dad. <15:00>  mr. heartland: *was* it.  there *is* something special about this boy after all.  act 3 <15:09>  tori: you *must* be excited, yuma. this is what you've always dreamt of. a chance to finally become a reallife duel champion. yuma: yeah... astral: yuma.  astral: there is more to it than just *that*. this is a very big tournament you are in, and a big tournament means there will be a *lot* of duelists. which means there *could be* a lot of number cards. yuma: right. and with each one we get, you get back a memory. and to tell ya the truththat's the *real* reason that i wanted this heart piece so bad. astral: what do you mean, yuma. i thought this was all about you wanting to become a duel champion for your father. yuma: yeahand it still kind of is.  yuma: but when i think about my dad, and all the things he said, i think it would mean more to him if i dueled for something *else*. for an even *bigger* cause. <16:00> if i dueled for something meaningful, like a bond. astral: a bond. yuma: yeahlike the bond *we* have, astral. like the bond i've felt with every duelist i've ever faced. seeit's not about whether you *win or lose*. dueling's about something more precious than that. something on a whole other level. astral : that is not true for all. yuma: what'cha mean. astral: i mean *kite*. losing is not an option, for him. and he does not *give* second chances. yuma: yeah. he wins, i lose, and instead if *dueling* i end up *drooling* like a mindless zombie. but *don't you worry*, astral. i'm not afraid of going headtohead with *him*, 'cause i can alwaysastral: yuma...  yuma: what's up.  tori: yuma... if anything bad happens to you, i'll... i'll...  yuma: hey, don't cry. i'm gonna be just fine. like i'd be scared of someone named *kite*. pleasei'll make him beg like a dog. aroooo.  tori: okay, *relax*. i don't care *what* his name is, or if you make 'im beg. i really just care about *one thing*. <17:00>  tori: that *you beat him*, and get outta this tournament in *one piece*. understand. otherwiseyou'll have *me* to deal with.   astral : interesting. dueling is about something more precious than winning or losing. something on a *whole other level*... but *what*, yuma. what.  yuma: choices, choices...  yuma: manit's hard to build a deck. and i got a hunch not just for *me*...   flip: heheheheh...     kite : little brother, i promise you...  kite: ... things *will be* as they were. <18:00>  act 4 <18:05>  check it out. oh, that's pretty cool. they must be going *lightspeed*.  tori: i can't believe it's finally here. yuma: yeah.  mr. heartland : welcome, duelists, to heart land city. welcome to the world duel carnival. now then, here are the rules.  mr. heartland : the field of play is the *entire city*. and the first phase of this tournament will last *three days*. during these three days...  mr. heartland : if you are challenged to a duel, you must *accept* that challenge.   mr. heartland : *how* do you accept a challenge.  mr. heartland : simple.  mr. heartland : you will *wager your heart piece*. lose your heart pieceand you lose your spot here. but if you *win*you win a heart piece.  mr. heartland : assemble all *five* pieces and you'll have won a spot in the tournament finals. if you have further questions about the rules, well, that's just *too bad*. because i'm sure, like our viewers at homei can't wait another second to get started. so let the duels begin..  bronk: hoho, *yeah*. it's every duelist for *'imself*, now.  flip: see ya in the finals. heheheheheh. tori: wonder who'll make the first move. yuma: yeahand who that person's gonna challenge.  striker: outta my way. *move it*.  striker : since winning this tournament is my goal, i'll let my soccer ball pick my opponent.  tori: that looks like it *hurt*.  tori: what's your *problem*. this is a *duel tournament*, not a soccer match. striker: for me they're one in the same. now, thenget up, *ball boy*, 'cause we're dueling. yuma: uah....  so i'm first.. end <20:45> * special thanks to animeratio.com for the copy of this episode transcribed
