 mr. heartland: we're down to our *final* four duelists as the world duel carnival nears its *thrilling* conclusion. but first, we'll reveal the stadium's *latest upgrade*.. now, elevate the *duel tower*..  mr. heartland: hope you're not scared a' *heights*'cause you're about to witness some of the *dizziest dueling action ever*, as shark battles yuma, and kite confronts vetrix.  bronk : yuma's gonna take on shark.. kazwell: he's dueled against shark before, so it *could* give 'im a *big advantage* in this round. yuma knows all about shark's cards and moves. now he can use that knowledge to plan out his strategy. flip: but shark knows the same things about yuma, too.  flip: *besides*, we all know yuma never plans his strategy, 'cause *then* he'd have to use his *brain*.  tori : it's true that yuma's dueled shark many times in the past, but he never had to battle a monster like the one shark used against quatro.  fb shark: appear, chaos number thirtytwo. shark drake vice.  tori: i hope yuma...  will be okay.... mr. heartland: the opening duel of the semifinal round will beginnow.  mr. heartland : our first duelist was *unknown* when he took the world duel carnival by storm in a series of *spectacular* victories.   yuma: yeah.. mr. heartland: he may look like a *pintsized pipsqueak*, but this kid has the heart of a giant.  yuma: i won't let you guys down..  yuma: hahaha. whoooa.   mr. heartland : the *last* time we saw yuma's challenger in the spotlight, he was banished from the dueling world in *disgrace*. mr. heartland: but now he's back, with a vengeance.  mr. heartland: no opponent is safe when *this* shark zeroes in on his prey.  mr. heartland: it's reginald *kastle*.. yuma: what's up with shark.... he looks strange.  hey shark. is everything okay.  he didn't react. something's gotta be *wrong*. mr. heartland: before you start dueling, let's add a little *altituuude*.  yuma: ah.  mr. heartland: only *one* of these rivals will advance. will the winner be *yuma*, the dueling wonderkid. or will *shark* complete his comeback.  mr. heartland: our two duelists know they have to lay it *all* on the line. are you ready to see the most epic duel ever *waged*..  yeah. then *let's go*..  act 1 <<3:49  yuma : shark looks *totally spaced out*. kinda like *i* get in math class... astral: it is possible shark has become possessed. yuma: huh.  astral : as you surely remember, shark summoned out a chaos number during his battle with quatro.  astral: the darkness within that number was too much for shark to control. i believe it has *overpowered him completely* now. yuma: you mean it's like it's *zombified* 'im. poor shark.  vetrix: shark versus yumawhat an entertaining matchup. it should be a *nailbiter* with these two. yeseven if i *already know* who the winner's going to be. hmhmhmhmhmhmhmhm.  vetrix: hmhmhmhmhmhmhmhm. yuma: snap *out* of it, shark. fight that number. don't let it take over.  astral: yuma, this duel will be challenging.  astral: if that number *does* control shark, then his dueling abilities will be *even sharper than they normally are*.  astral: you *must stay alert*.  yuma: don't worry. i'll help shark and *rule this duel*. let's go..  yuma: yeah. duel disk, go..  yuma: duel gazerlet's *roll*.  yuma: get set to get decked. computer: augmented reality vision link established.  yuma: let's duel.  yuma: i guess i'll get things rolling. i draw. first i'll place a monster in defense mode. and next, i'll play a second card facedown, ending my turn. astral : perfect. the first card yuma put down is dododo bot. it has nineteen hundred defense points. the other card is the trap impenetrable attack. he's put himself in a strong position to *survive* an attack. yuma: take it away. you're up. shark: it's my turn.  to start, i summon my spear shark.  yuma: only sixteen hundred attack points. it's harmless. astral: are you sure. do not underestimate shark's tactics. shark: spear sharkattack yuma's facedown monster.  astral: why would he make such a *reckless attack* on a facedown card. it could be much stronger than his own monster.  yuma: shark.  astral: i do not understand. to attack without knowing the opposing card's strength is foolish.  mr. heartland: whoa, that move is costing reginald bigtime.  *he got careless*, and now he's *down for the count*  instead of yuma.  bronk: shark made a rookie mistake. flip: i only expected something *that* pathetic to be done by *yuma*. kazwell: maybe this is all part of shark's game plan. think about it... yuma knows shark's usual strategies inside and out, right. so what if shark decided to *change things up* because he figured that would confuse yuma. bronk: you're sayin' shark took that damage on *purpose*.  shark : now, yuma, i will place one card facedown, and end my turn.  yuma: man. shark's *totally* not acting like himself this duel. astral: you have *no way of knowing* what is going through his mind. i believe the wisest course is to keep your guard up and stay prepared for surprises. and you *must not grow overconfident*. yuma: i'm too good to let that happen.  watch out. it's my turn to draw.. i summon gogogo golem.   yuma: now i switch dododo bot to attack mode. okay, get moving, gogogo golem. blast spear shark..  yuma: *shark*...  yuma: ...he's still under the control of that number. i'll have to shock 'im back to his senses. get set, dododo bot. give shark your lightning blade.  shark: aaaaaggghhhh.   mr. heartland: whoa. talk about electrifying.  mr. heartland: that jolt just cost shark *eighteen hundred lifepoints*.  mr. heartland: if he doesn't rise soon, he'll have to *forfeit the duel completely*. yuma: get up, shark. you've gotta gut this duel out to the end.  act 2 <<8:49  bronk: what's *wrong*. i know shark isn't a *quitter*. yuma: don't give up *now*, shark. keep on battling. you're the fiercest duelist i ever met*nobody's* tougher than you. you're supposeta duel like a *shark*. i've seen *guppies* with more fight.  yuma: ...i won't attack 'im when he's down. i'm putting a card facedown, and ending my turn.  yuma: aren'tcha at least gonna *try*..  yuma: yeah, that's right. come on, shark. get up and duel. shark : yes... i *must duel*.... that's why i'm *here*...  shark : but... what'm i *fighting* for. i *know* there's a reason.  shark : but i can't remember what it is.  *try to remember*. *what's my reason for dueling*..  vetrix: have you *really* forgotten.  shark : *vetrix*..  vetrix: you know who i am. that's very *good*, shark. i'm relieved that your memory has not been *completely* wiped out. together we can *rebuild* what has been lost. if you trust me, i can help you remember *everything*. listen*i* know the reason that you duel. it is simple. you duel for *me*. shark: for *you*. vetrix: exactly. that is your whole purpose. you are my puppet and you obey my commands. and now, i *command* you to *completely destroy your enemy*.  shark: my enemy... must be destroyed... completely.   shark: gahughaaagghhh.... aaaggghhhh.... yuma: shark.. shark: aaaaaaaghh....  vetrix: heheheheheheheh. shark: aaghughagh. uugghh.... yuma: shark, what's wrong.. mr. heartland: uhohshark's having a *massive meltdown*. the pressure of competing on the *big stage* must be  *getting to him*.  vetrix: what's the *problem*, shark. i *told* you what you have to do. so *why are you resisting my commands*.  vetrix : i told you beforei planted a dark seed in your heart. use it to destroy your enemies.  vetrix: let me *remind* you who your enemies are and why you detest them.   vetrix : think back on your own sister and what they did to her.  vetrix : you *must* get revenge on those responsible.    shark : rio..  shark : i know him. that's... *quatro*..  shark: vetrix, too..  shark: could they be my *enemies*.  shark: who is *that*.  vetrix: it's doctor faker.  vision dr. faker: heheheheheh.  shark: feel like i've *heard* that name before...  shark: aaaahhhhh...  vetrix: doctor faker. his name should fill your heart with *rage*, of course. you see, he's the one who injured your *little sister*. you vowed that you would make him pay for his terrible crime, and that you wouldn't let *anyone* stand in your way. shark : yes, of course... doctor faker... *he's* the one who hurt my little sister.... doctor faker is my enemy. i'll do whatever it takes to *destroy* him.  vetrix: it's true. you must destroy doctor faker. but that's not *possible*, shark. because there's someone else standing in your way. shark: but who do you mean.  vetrix: you've forgotten *his* identity, *too*. let me jog your memory.  vision yuma: hehahahahaha, hahahahaha. shark: yuma tsukumo. vetrix: yes. surely you remember how ruthless yuma can be. he's always *meddling in your plans* and sabotaging them. shark: rrrgghhh....    vetrix: even now, yuma is *standing in your way*.  vetrix : he's trying to defeat you for doctor faker. vetrix: just as he teamed up with faker before vetrix : to strike down your sister rio.  yuma: shark.  shark: rrrgghhhh, i'll *never forgive you*.... yuma: uah.... act 3 <<13:29 shark: let's settle this*once and for all*, yuma.  astral : that crest on his hand. yuma : we've seen it before. astral: you are correct. it is the same crest that belongs to vetrix. yuma: then shark, *isn't* possessed by a number, he's possessed by vetrix.  vetrix: you *almost* have it right. to be precise, shark's soul has been *taken over by a number*. but it is controlled by yours truly.  vetrix : because of this, i *also control shark* now.  vetrix : he is *my puppet*, and i will *use* this puppet vetrix: to destroy you, yuma. shark: get ready.  here it comes, yumaaa... i summon my double shark.   shark: next i'll give my shark some extra bite by using my "aqua jet" spell card. it gains a thousand attack points 'til the end of the turn.  shark: okay, double shark, it's chow time. polish off gogogo golem now.. astral: yuma. launch a defense. yuma: i'll use a trap"impenetrable attack". it protects gogogo golem from destruction. shark: it's no use. 'cause i can neutralize your trap card with my spell card "shark spark". so your gogogo golem is a goner.  yuma: no way..  shark: good work, double shark. now, finish your attack.  yuma: rrrrgghhh. tori: yuma. shark: you're not out of danger. double shark can double up its attack get dododo bot.  yuma: aaaaahhhh.  mr. heartland: for a *second* there, it really looked like shark was throwing in the towelbut *now* he's going on the *attack*. that's what i call *really showing heart*, way to go...   bronk: it's a total *turnaround*. kazwell: i wonder what woke 'im up. flip: maybe he was fakin' it before. shark: i'm not finished *yet*, yuma. it's *payback day*..  shark: i'll start by activating my spell, "upswell". since i just destroyed one of your monsters in battle, i can use this spell to summon spear shark back from my graveyard. i just have to lower its attack points by one thousand.  shark: spear shark. prepare to attack.  shark: i'm gonna get revenge for my sister, rio.  yuma: huh. shark: spear shark. attack yuma directly..  tori: ohh, yuma.  yuma: well, at least he's dueling like his *normal self* again... astral: shark is *far* from normal. it is clear that vetrix has intensified his control of shark's mind.  astral: the rage that's growing inside shark makes him a much more *dangerous* opponent.  yuma: he's angrybut why's he angry at *me*.  fb shark: rrgh, i'll *never forgive you*... i'm gonna get revenge for my sister rio..  yuma: he thinks *i* hurt her. it's vetrix. he changed shark's memories. astral: he has. by making shark believe *you* harmed his sister, vetrix has unleashed shark's anger. shark: i'll finish you off on my next turn, yuma.  shark: since i'm done for now, double shark goes back down to twelve hundred attack points.  vetrix: magnificent.. two monsters destroyed, plus a direct attack on yuma.  vetrix: and he did it all in a single turn. shark has become a *ruthless dueling machine*.. after this duel i can unleash 'im on my archenemy,  *doctor faker*... ahahahahahahahaha. act 4 <<17:15 yuma: i've gotta find a way to help shark. how can i stop vetrix from controlling him. astral: the problem is not just vetrix. a number is possessing shark, too.  astral : and that number can evolve into a chaos number, shark drake vice. if shark summons the number *before* you break vetrix's grip on his mind...  astral: then it will be *almost impossible* to save shark. yuma: it's *not gonna happen*. i'll do whatever it takes to win this duel. hopefully that will restore shark back to his normal self.  bronk, flip, kazwell, tori, tori's two friends: yuma. yuma. yuma. tori: yuma. yuma: it's *my turn*. i draw. i'm gonna scare up, gogogo ghost in attack mode.   yuma: all right, gogogo ghost. slam spear shark with spear strength. shark: i don't think so. i'm activating a trap. "zeus's breath".  shark: you can't overpower the mighty zeus. it easily blocks your attack, and since i have a waterattribute monster on my field, this trap blasts you with eight hundred points of damage.  yuma: whaaaaa.. tori: yuma got hit again. bronk: if this keeps uphe'll be a *goner*. kazwell: i thought yuma had this won, but now it's all shark. cathy : yeah, but yuma still has more lifepoints... flip: an' i bet he's gonna need every last *one* of 'em.  yuma: my move. i'm placing one card facedown, and *ending my turn*. you're up. shark: and you're goin' *down*, yuma. yuma: ugh.... shark: i have a card that's gonna *finish you off* forever. i'll get revenge, for what you did to rio. yuma: you've got it wrong. vetrix is tricking you. what happened to your sister is *his fault*. shark: rrrrgghhh. i don't believe you. we both know you'd say *anything* to save yourself. but it's *too late*, yuma. it's ending now. you're guilty and this is your judgment day. i'll finish you off when i use my number. yuma: number.. astral: of course.... shark only needs one more monster to build the overlay network. shark: at last. hah..  shark: i summon shocktopus to my field in attack mode.   shark: now everything is set. i'll overlay my levelfour shocktopus, along with my double shark and spear shark. with these three monsters, i build the overlay network..  shark: i xyz summon, number thirtytwo, shark drake.    astral: this is bad, yuma.   vetrix: perfect. i'm *very pleased* with you, shark. now unleash your number, and stomp out that pest once and for all.. ahahahahahahahahaha.  end <<20:26 * special thanks to animeratio.com for the copy of this episode transcribed online. * special thanks to yugioh wikia as a source for checking cards. * special thanks to kazuki takahashi, 4kids, et al. for yugioh. zexal. last updated: may 20, 2013 i don't own yugioh zexal, at all, and this transcript is unofficial and without any permission whatsoever. please link back to me if you use my work. for more information about my transcript format, please click here. read my blog post on this episode here  )
