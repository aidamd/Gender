  act 1 <<2:04   nurse: may.  nurse: it's almost time for your surgery.  nurse: don't worryyou're just gonna take a *nap*, and when you wake up, it'll be done. may: mm. but, uh...  may: my uncle should be here.  tori: yuma.  tori: please be careful.  charlie: all right, yumait's time to let the *games* begin. yuma: first move's mine. here goesi draw. i place a monster facedown in defense mode. then i end my turn with a facedown card.  astral : is charlie going to *once again* rely on luck. charlie: my turni draw. i activate the "take a chance" spell card. pass me the dice'cause take a chance allows me to roll a die once per turn.  charlie: and if it comes up a *six*, my current lifepoints are multiplied by five. any *other* number, and my lifepoints return to where they were before i *activated* the spell. yuma: hah. well it's not like it's easy to roll a six or anythin'. astral: and do not forget, he rolled a six *five times in a row* during his last duel. the odds of rolling six sixes in a row are fortysix thousand six hundred fiftysix *to one*.  charlie: watch closely. yuma: no *way* you'll get it.  yuma: *another six*. how is that *possible*.. charlie: suddenly i've got twenty thousand lifepoints.  yuma: rrrgghhh... charlie: 's long as the sun that shines stays complete, i never have to fear defeat. yuma: do *what*.. the sun already went *down*, hours ago. charlie: and yet my incredible lucky streak continues. i now summon, majestic jester.  charlie: majestic jester, take out 'is facedown monster. yuma: but majestic jester doesn't have any attack points. charlie: go, dark pantomime.   yuma: gogogo golem's got fifteen hundred defense points. so *you're* the one who's taking damage. charlie: not necessarily. majestic jester's ability activates.  yuma: you gotta be kidding.. charlie: luck's gonna decide if i take damage or not. if i roll a six while majestic jester is attacking, your monster is instantly destroyed.  charlie: any other number comes up, and this clown is goin' down.  astral: the odds of *this* happening are two hundred seventynine thousand nine hundred thirtysix to one. yuma: *enough* with the statistics. charlie: let's roll.  ha.  astral: implausible. yuma: gah, *come on*. charlie: all right. gogogo golem is *donefor*.  charlie: i toss one card facedown, and end my turn.  tori: ugh... yuma, hurry. this train is out of control..  charlie: don't worry about *that*, worry about the fact that you have no chance of winning. hnhnhnhn... act 2 <<<5:31>  kari : charlieyou vanished without a *word*.  kari : and now you pop back into my life acting like you did *nothing wrong*.  kari : expecting things to be the same. wellthey're *not*.   yuma: my turn. i draw. i summon, gagaga magician.  yuma: rrrghh. this is the part where i try *my* luck. i activate the "monster slots" spell card.  yuma: with this card, i banish a monster in my graveyard that's the same level as gagaga magician.  yuma: and then i can draw a new card from my deck. if it's a monster that has the same level as the other two monsters, i can summon it to my field. astral: but if it is *not*, yuma, then the card you draw *and* your levelfour gagaga magician will be banished. this is foolish. yuma: nnngghh, who asked you.. if this works, i'll have an xyz monster out in notime. charlie: but it's *not* gonna work. fortune is favoring *me* right now, which means *you* are outta luck. yuma: we'll see about that. okay, here we go. i draw..  yuma: agh... *seriously*.  yuma. so much for *those* cards... charlie: sorry, yumai'm afraid lady luck is on *my* side.  yuma: welli end my turn. astral: it occurs to me that the odds of us defeating him might be*fifteen million to one*. yuma: come on. have a little *faith*, astral. charlie: don't you *get* it, yuma. yuma: huh. charlie: if luck isn't on your side, everything *else* goes out the window. i *always* admired your old man. i thought he had *everything*.  charlie : courage... intelligence... charisma... passion...  charlie: but you know what he *didn't* have. he didn't have *luck* on his side. yuma: and. charlie: if he'd just had a *little bit* a' luck, then he... yuma: what're you talking about..  charlie: sometimes you come to a point where it all comes down to one thinggood luck. and if luck isn't on your side, there's *nothing you can do*.  charlie: and nowit's *my turn*. i draw. time to play take a chance again. if i roll a six, my lifepoints get multiplied by five.  yuma: ggghhh, come on, two.  yuma: six *again*.. tori: how's that *possible.. charlie: fortune favors the bold. now i'm sittin' on a hundred thousand points.  yuma: this is crazy. there's *nothing i can do* to defeat this guy.. charlie: and now, by activating the "release change" spell, i can toss a monster off my field, then summon a monster with the same level to take its place. say goodbye to majestic jester. and then say *hello* to dice leveler.  charlie: next, i activate the "monster slots" spell card. yuma: hey, that's the same card i just played... charlie: that's right. but somehow i think things are gonna end differently for me. first, i select levelone dice leveler.  charlie: and then i banish levelone majestic jester from my graveyard. nowif the card i draw is a levelone monster, then i can place that monster on my field.  charlie: yes. there we go. it's dice leveler.  yuma: *two* of 'em. charlie: actually charlie: i'm gonna make this a *perfect triple jackpot*. i summon a *third* dice leveler.  astral: this is bad, yuma. yuma: huh. charlie: and now i roll the dice, and dice leveler's level increases by the number i roll.  charlie: come onall sixes..  astral: the odds of him rolling three *more* sixes, are three hundred sixtytwo million, seven hundredyuma: rrrrggghhh. i don't wanna hear it anymore.. charlie: what've we got.  charlie: yeah.  yuma: *come on*. this isn't happening. i don't believe it. charlie: *believe* itall three a' my monsters become levelsevens. and now i'm just gonna *overlay* my dice levelers, and build myself a little *overlay network*.  charlie: i xyz summon, number seven, luckyyy straight.   yuma: there he is.. astral: the number card.  charlie: what can i say, yuma*life is a carnival*. yuma: now what. charlie: whaddaya mean, 'now what'. now ya lose. as long as the sun stays complete, heheheheheheheh... i never have to fear defeat.  act 3 <<10:41  tori: aaahh.  kari : tori. tori : *kari*.. kari: stay calm and listen. that monorail you guys are on is gonna reach the final station in about *five minutes*.  tori: what. that doesn't leave much time. kari : don't worry. kari: i'll think of something, just *hang tight*.  tori: yuma.. the end of the line is coming up. yuma: what.. charlie: don't worrymy good luck will make sure we stop *safe and sound*. i'd be *more* worried by the fact that i can cash in an overlay unit, and multiply lucky straight's attack points by whatever number i roll.  charlie: come on, be good to me.  yuma: ah....  yuma, astral, tori: ahh. charlie: all right. normally lucky straight's got seven hundred attack points. but when multiplied by sixwe're talkin' *fortytwo hundred*. yuma: how can i stop *that*.. charlie: lucky straight, attack yuma directly. go, handslam. astral: yuma. your trap. yuma: i'm on it. i activate the "nitwit outwit" trap card. this trap allows me to send one monster in my hand to the graveyard, in order to lower the damage i take by that monster's attack points. you're up, zubaba knight. time to take one for the team.   yuma: aaaaaugh. tori: yuma.  charlie: a welltimed trap card. not bad. you bought yourself another turn. yuma: ugh, this isn't good... ya got any suggestions for me, astral. astral: if his luck is perfect, then... there is nothing you can do. yuma: well, but...  kari : hey.  kari : you guys need to wrap this up soon. yuma: kari. charlie: kari.  kari : don't try to run off and hide again, charlie. you and i are gonna have a *little talk*. charlie : and what're we gonna *talk about*.  how you *miss me* and think about me all the time.  kari : yuma. yuma: ah. kari : you're losing against the lucky straight card he took from the museum. aren't you. yuma: uh.. maybe. kari : there's a saying that goes with that card. 'as long as the sun that shines stays complete, i never have to fear defeat'. yuma. okaywhat does that mean. kari : i searched the datanet, but i couldn't find any answers. yuma: but you know everything. charlie: it's just a little *saying*. ya know. for *good luck*. as long as the sun that shines stays complete, i never have to fear defeat. astral: 'the sun that shines'... charlie: it doesn't *mean* anything, it's just a *figure of speech*.  kari: we're running out of time here. ... hm.  charlie: you can go ahead and *give up* now, if you want. don't think anyone'd *blame* ya. yuma: that's nice of you to *say*. thing isthere's no *way* i'm giving up. it's my turn. i draw. i'm summoning ganbara knight. ganbara knight: ganbara.  yuma: and when i successfully bring a levelfour monster to the field, i can then summon kagetokage from my hand.  yuma: and now, i'm gonna overlay ganbara knight and kagetokage.  yuma: with these two monsters, i build the overlay network. i xyz summon, number thirtynine, utopia.  yuma: and now, utopia, attack lucky straight. charlie: i activate a trap. "dice crisis". if i roll a *six*, one a' your monsters loses all its attack points, and i take control of it. yuma: rrrgghhh.  yuma: let's see a *three*... tori: *anything* but six...  yuma, tori, astral: ah.. charlie: wouldja *look at that*. another six.  charlie: utopia is *mine*. yuma: this is bad. rrrghh. i place one card facedownand end my turn.  charlie: last stopcomin' up. let's end this duel. ya can't *win*, yuma. sometimes ya just have to know when to *walk away*. yuma: that's not gonna happen. 'cause here's the thing, charliei'd rather lose relying on my skills as a duelist, than win relying on luck. you remember my dad. don'tcha. charlie: that's right. yuma: then you know he taught me to believe in myself and to never back down and never walk away. so i *won't*. i won't give up. astral: yuma..... yuma: win or lose, i'll see this through to the end.. and the end is gonna be *me*, *winning*. charlie: i *get it*. ya got *spirit*, i'll *give ya* that. but it's *my turn* now. astral: *yuma*.. yuma: on it. no so fast. first, i activate a trap. "commander of swords". i can use this when there's a lightattribute warriortype monster on the field, and it doesn't matter if it's on my side or yours. now *draw your card*.  yuma: if it's a spell or a trap card, then i get to destroy *it*, *or* a spell or trap card on your field instead. charlie: i seeyou're hopin' to get rid of dice crisis. you want utopia back. yuma: *draw the card*, charlie.  charlie: hm. i drew a little beauty known as "sun scale".  charlie: with *this* card in play, once a turn if i roll a six, i can obliterate every monster on your field. and i meanlet's face it, yuma. with the way things've been going, we *both know* that i'm gonna roll a six. astral: the *sun*.... yuma: hnnnngghhh. i'm destroying dice crisis andastral: wait. do not do that. yuma: why not. astral: *sever the sun*. yuma: the sun... charlie: huh.  charlie: no *way*. yuma: oh, right. it's a *sun*. charlie: that's just an *expression*, thoughit won't *do* anything... yuma: you sound like you're *not too sure* about that. let's find out what happens. with the power of the commander of swords trap, i'm destroying sun scale. charlie: there's no *way*....  yuma: go, utopia. rising sun slash..  tori: he did it.... yuma managed to cut the sun in half.  charlie: waitno. don't leave me *now*. yuma: what's that light. charlie : *did that just break my lucky streak*.  hmph. you're *finished*, yuma. since sun scale was destroyed, you take five hundred points of damage.  yuma: aaah.  charlie: and now, to follow that up, i'm using take a chance's effect.  charlie: you know what happens if i roll a six. my lifepoints are once again multiplied by five. ha.  charlie: one.. noooooooo..  charlie: unbelievable. i guess my luck seems to've *run out*. i end my turn. astral: now. this is it, yuma. yuma: yeah. let's do this thing. i draw. ha.. i activate the "comeback." spell card. this allows me to get my monster back from your field. all right, utopia, time to come home.  yuma: i'm feelin' the flow.. go, chaos xyz evolution.  yuma: get ready for chaos number thirtynineutopia ray.   charlie: oh, man... just my luck.... yuma: utopia ray's ability activates.  yuma: for every overlay unit it uses, it gains five hundred attack points.  yuma: go, overlay charge.  yuma: and that's not all. also, for every overlay unit, your monster *loses* one thousand attack points.  yuma: now do it, utopia ray. attack lucky straight. rising sun chaos slash.  charlie: ahhhhhh.    yuma: all right. i won.  tori: yuma. yuma: huh. tori: the station..  yuma: we're not gonna stop in time.  yuma: kari.. what're you doing, it's too dangerous.. kari: *i told you* i'd think a' something.  yuma: kari, get outta the way...  act 4 <<<20:50> yuma: kari, get outta the way...  yuma: kari.  kari: you guys okay. yuma: we're good. tori: thanks. kari: that, was close. ah. wait, what about charlie..  charlie: i've *jinxed* it.... i am *so sorry*, may. our luckit's gone. kari: what're you talking about.. charlie: kari.  kari: who's this *may* girl, charlie..  charlie: may.  may: huh. uncle charlie.  charlie: *really sorry* that i'm late, kiddo. may: it's okay. charlie: you're gonna do *great* in there. ya got nothin' to worry about. may: yeahi know. charlie: you, are *brave*. may: thanks.  charlie: huh. oh, and one more thing.  charlie: take this card... for good luck. not that 'cha *need* it.  may: thank you. you're the best, uncle charlie. : ...see that. kari : maybe the good luck came *back* to the card now that it changed hands.  charlie : may's operation was a risky one. but they told us it had to be done.  charlie: *that's* why i wanted lucky straight. i wanted luck to be on *her side*. wanted to make sure that *nothin' could go wrong*.  kari: yeah, well...  kari: what you did was *stupid*, it was.. charlie: kari.  charlie: yuma's a great duelist. he's *definitely* got your old man's spirit. you be sure an' tell 'im that for me, wouldja. and, uh...  charlie: it was good to see you again.  charlie: later, kari. off for another *globetrotting adventure*.  charlie: wish me luck. heheh.  yuma: hey, toriwanna go grab a bite or somethin'. tori: yeah. i'm really hungry. astral: charlie *is* going to give us that number card, right, yuma. yuma: yeah, it's gonna be *fine*. astral: i think we *really* should've stayed with them. yuma: ya feel like tacos or burgers. astral: yumatori: i say, tacos. astral: yuma. yuma: good call. end <<22:19 * special thanks to animeratio.com for the copy of this episode transcribed online. * special thanks to yugioh wikia as a source for checking cards. * special thanks to kazuki takahashi, 4kids, et al. for yugioh. zexal. last updated: february 4, 2013 i don't own yugioh zexal, at all, and this transcript is unofficial and without any permission whatsoever. please link back to me if you use my work. for more information about my transcript format, please click here. read my blog post on this episode here  )
