 i overlay three leveltwo giant germs.  and these germs are gonna make you feel *sick*, 'cause now i can build the overlay network. bronk: he's gonna xyzsummon with 'em.  now appear. number ninetysix, dark mist.   bronk: it only has a hundred attack points. tori: is that right. he's so big. yuma: yepand the bigger they are, the harder they fall. bronk: wait, yuma. maybe it's *you* who's fallin', for a trap. astral: bronk is right, we must be careful. yuma: careful, shmareful. attack, utopia. bronk: no, wait.. yuma: cut right through that mist. bronk: oh, no. yuma: go, rising sun slash.  yuma: i did it. i won.  yuma: and to the victor go the *spoils*or in this case, the number ninetysix.    tori: way to duel, yuma.. yuma: yeah, i got the skills that give the chills.  yuma: i'm tellin' you guys, these days, *no one* can beat me. i'm not just *feelin'* the flow, i *am* the flow. tori: wow, you sure are confident. bronk: *too* confident if ya ask *me*. don't forget your *roots*, yuma. yuma: my roots. come on, be serious.  bronk: i *am* being serious, you got to where you are with *my help*, we used to be a *team*.. yuma : well now i'm a solo act.. and i never needed you *anyhow*. bronk: mmmgh.  you know, you've got a real big mouth..  yuma: no, *you* do.  bronk: i meant *figuratively*. yuma: well *i* mean *literally*. tori : *would you knock it off*... yuma: no, but i'll knock bronk's *block* off. <2:00> bronk: bring it on..   act 1 <3:03>  yuma and bronk: hmph.   yuma and bronk: hmph.  yuma: duel period. now, who to throw down with.  yuma and bronk: hmph.  tori : boys will be boys... or in this case, *babies*...  astral: with every new number card, a new memory reveals itself.  astral: but this *particular* memory...  astral: ... has left me with more questions than answers.   yuma: it's been three days since bronk and i talked. that's the longest we've gone since... well, since we first *met*. astral: and how *did* you two meet.   fb young yuma: hi. i'm yuma tsukumo. and it's my dream to be a duel champion. fb young bronk: a *duel champion*.  <4:00> fb young bronk: so how many wins d'ya got so *far*. fb young yuma: aaiih... actually i haven't won once yet. fb young bronk: huh..  fb young bronk: an' he wants to be *champ*.   bronk : i'll never forget it. we were all laughin', then he goes an' challenges me.  fb young yuma: i *will* be a duel champion, you'll see. fb young bronk: only thing *i'm* seein' is me with a 'w'. fb both: let's duel.  yuma: he totally *kicked my butt* that day...  yuma : ... but when i asked for a rematch, he let me have one.   fb young yuma and young bronk: let's duel..   fb young yuma: i *won't give up*, never, *ever*..  bronk : before i knew it... i *liked* the kid. before i knew it, we were *friends*.     yuma: whaddaya *mean*, 'apologize'. tori: well, *one of you* has to be the bigger man. <5:00> yuma: yeah, and bronk's *way* bigger than me, so it'll have to be *him*. tori: but...  astral: yuma, listen to your friend tori, she has a point.  astral: bronk is your best friend, so why not simply swallow your pride and go *talk* to him. yuma: i'll *tell ya* why 'cause i had a big lunch and i'm not hungry.  bronk: yeah.  yuma: deeiii...diiaaahhh...  yuma: huh. hey, hold up bronk: well that's what you get for *grabbin'* at me.  yuma: aah.  astral: ahhh.... what is happening.  astral: ugh. uuugghh..  yuma: astral.  bronk: don't see *that* every day... uhwait. <6:00>  astral: number ninetysix. it is trying to take control of me..... yuma: whaddaya *mean*, 'trying to take control of you'.. astral: ugh...  dark mist: he means that when you dropped your key, you allowed *me* to escape. and now that i'm free, i can take control of your *dear friend*, astral.  astral: aaaaahhhh.  yuma: aah. heeey. let go a' me.. bronk and tori: put him down. yuma: aahhyif this is a bad dream, someone wake me up.  dark mist astral: oh, this is no simple *nightmare*.  astral: yuma.. listen carefullyyou must give your utopia to bronk. yuma: butwhy. astral: justdo it..  yuma: bronk*catch*.  bronk: no way. <7:00>  yuma: astral, no. dark mist astral: heh. on to step twoacquiring number thirtynine, utopia. act 2 <7:10>  yuma: aah. lemme go. and tell me what you did with astral. dark mist astral: *i* will be the one making the demands here. not you. and right now, i am demanding that number card..  bronk: hhggyaaahh.  tori: bronk, what's going on..  bronk: i dunno. but i got a hunch it has som'n to do wit' this key...  bronk : if i could just get it back to yumamaybe things'll be okay. but that means i gotta *free* yuma first.  bronk: heytall, dark, and creepy. if you want this number so bad, beat me in a duel. dark mist astral: a *duel*. yuma: no, bronk. just run. forget meand save yourself. bronk: no way, *no how*, yuma. yuma: huh. <8:00> bronk: i never leave a friend behindand like it or not, you're still my friend. yuma: i am. dark mist astral: hmhm. how touching.  yuma: ah. dark mist astral: very well, let us duel.  bronk: duel disk, go. *and*, duel gazer, let's roll. computer voice: augmented reality vision link established.  dark mist astral: oh, and by the way... yuma will be dueling for me. not his *mind*, but his body. so be careful. hmhmhmhmhmhm. bronk: i'm gonna go first. so get ready.  my draw.  bronk: *first*, i'm summonin' out ayeiron.   ayeiron: aye. aye. ayyye. bronk: next i'll deck ayeiron out, with the equip spell "spring punch".  bronk: then i activate ayeiron's special ability. so now my ayeiron packs on four hundred pounding attack points.  <9:00> bronk: and *that* activates spring punch's effect. when my monster gains attack points, you take half its attack points as damage. that equals a thousand.  ayeiron: aye. aye. ayyyyyyee.  tori: yuma..  yuma: don't worry about me, bronk. just, keep dueling.  bronk: next, i activate the trap card "gearspring catapult". and theni end my turn.  bronk : hold on, pali'm gonna save you. dark mist astral: hmhmhm. *my* turn now. so *draw*.  dark mist astral: first up, i am summoning acorno. i can summon this card by sending one card in my hand to the graveyard.  dark mist astral: and you see. since the card i sent to the grave is *pinecono*, it now sprouts upright back on the field.  dark mist astral: next i summon forth, darklon.  dark mist astral: and now, you're in a very hairy situation. you see, when darklon is summoned, <10:00> all my monsters *increase* their level by one.  dark mist astral: but i am not done yet. next i'm overlaying these three leveltwos in order to build the overlay network, and xyzsummon.  dark mist astral: a copy of myselfnumber ninetysix, dark mist.   bronk: oh, man. that thing *already* summoned a number card. ahh... tori: waithow is that thing dark mist.. yuma: i knowit's completely different from before. dark mist astral: that is because this is dark mist's *true* appearance. and now, dark mist, attack ayeiron. bronk: he's attacking me with just one hundred points.. dark mist astral: not exactly. i activate dark mist's special ability. shadow gain.  dark mist astral: by using one overlay unit, dark mist can steal half of your monster's attack points in order to power itself up.  <11:00> bronk: then that means dark mist will always have more attack points than whatever monster *i* got. dark mist: you catch on quickly. nowlet him have it. whiplash whirlwind.  dark mist astral: next i place two cards facedown and end my turn.  bronk: i guess now i know what i'm up against...  bronk: and i'm not scared at *all*..  'cause i got the spell card "gearspring catapult" backin' me up. now every time it's my turn, i crank one gearspring counter.  tori: 'counter'.... bronk: that's right. if i'm gonna max out my card's effect, i gotta increase my counters. dark mist astral: oh, please. this duel will not last long enough for that strategy to work out. bronk: next i summon tin goldfish.   bronk: but i'm not done yet. now i'm playin' "iron call". and it's gonna be a *call to arms*. since there's a machinetype monster on my field, i can summon a levelfourorbelow machine, <12:00> right from my graveyard.  bronk: so *jump back in this*, ayeiron.  bronk: then i activate the spell card "iron draw" from my hand.  bronk: seesince there are two machinetype monsters on my field, "iron draw" lets me draw two *more* cards.  don't worry, yumayou're gonna be safe, soon.  now, i'll be overlayin' levelfour tin goldfish and ayeiron, and creating the overlay network. and you know what that meanshere comes an xyzsummon. appear, number thirtynine. utopia.   yuma: utopia....  dark mist astral: i have been waiting for you, number thirtynine.  bronk: yuma.... wwhat's happening..  bronk: it's like... i can *feel its power*....  bronk: all right. <13:00> next i play gearspring catapult's effect. by using one gearspring counter, i can increase utopia's attack points by five hundred this turn. tori: *three thousand* attack points. bronk: that's right. now attack, utopia. dark mist astral: yes, by all means. please, go right on ahead and attack. so that i can play dark mist's ability. shadow gain.  bronk: oh *man*. you can even use that ability during *my* turn..  tori: dark mist stole utopia's attack points.... dark mist astral: and it is going to *use* them, too. yuma: look out, bronk.. dark mist astral: go, whiplash whirlwind. bronk: i activate utopia's special ability. it stops utopia from attacking.  yuma: way to play d, bronk.  dark mist astral: way to play *right into my hands*. i now play the trap, "counterforce". <14:00> since you stopped your utopia's attack, you take damage equal to the difference in our two monsters' attack points.  tori: wait, so bronk gets hit with elevenhundred points of damage..  bronk: aaaggghhh. yuma: oh no, bronk. dark mist astral: perhaps now you see, for every move you make, i can make one *better*.  yuma: we're in trouble.... act 3 <14:31>  bronk : how'm i gonna *beat* this thing. it gets stronger whenever *it* attacks, or *i* attack *it*. bronk: ugh...  yuma: stay tough, ya hear me..  astral: yuma.... yuma.. yuma: huh..  astralis that you..  astral: yuma, listen carefully. *i have a plan*. bronk: from my hand i activate the spell "automatic gearspring machine". <15:00> 'automatic' 'cause from the second it hits the field, it's got *two gear spring counters*. then every time my turn comes, it gets *one more*. but the best part, is by sending this card to the graveyard, i can move its gear spring counters, to a completely *different* card.  dark mist astral: and just *what are you planning* with all those counters. bronk: you'll find out, *trust* me. next, i'll throw a facedownand end my turn. which means catapult's effect vanishes, and utopia loses five hundred points.  bronk: what's goin' on.. tori: yuma..  dark mist astral: hmhmhmhm. do not fret about yuma. he is just getting into his role as my pawn. and now it ismy draw.  firstdark mist will attack utopia. but not before mist gains some powerfrom the shadows.  bronk: i play utopia's special ability. <16:00> lightwing shield.. dark mist astral: *nothing* can protect him now. not once i play"overlay banish". it negates your monster's special ability. but you know what is *not* negated. whiplash whirlwind..  bronk: yaaaahhhh.  tori: get up, bronk.  dark mist astral: yes, please, do. so you can now see me destroy your gearspring catapult.  bronk: no way. dark mist astral: did you really think that i was going to let you keep your spell card. it is *obvious* you're planning to use it to power up the next monster you summon.  yuma : you're wrong... what bronk is planning to do is take you down with a *single finishing blow*.  dark mist astral: a single blow. yuma: yes, his facedown card is "gearspring exploder".  tori: don't give away his strategy, yuma. dark mist astral: no, *do*. <17:00> i find this all quite enlightening.  yuma: you see, with gearspring exploder, when it becomes bronk's turn and he gains counters, he'll deal eight hundred points of damage for every counter that he has. dark mist astral: eight hundred points. yuma: so next turn, gearspring catapult and automatic gearspring machine will each gain one counter for a total of four. and *that* will mean a total of thirtytwohundred points of damage.  yuma: if gearspring exploder activates, we will be defeated.  dark mist astral: thanks for the info.  bronk: yuma.... dark mist astral: in that casei will just *destroy* that facedown card. i am now activating the spell "xyz cyclone" from my hand.  dark mist astral: with this card, if an xyz monster was destroyed, one trap card is destroyed as well.  bronk : so much for gearspring exploder. dark mist astral: and with that, i will end my turn.  thank you, yuma. always nice to get the inside scoop.  bronk : i can't believe it. *yuma sold me out*.... act 4 <18:00> dark mist astral: your friend yuma has shown me how to beat you. his loyalty to me has sealed your doom.  dark mist astral: give up now, and i will show you mercy.  fb young yuma: i *won't give up*, never, *ever*..   bronk: *same with me*..  i *won't give up*, just like yuma never has. huh. *wait a sec.*  bronk : an' maybe he *still* hasn't. of *course*.  bronk: here goesmy draw.  bronk: *perfect*. first things first. i put one counter on both gearspring catapult and automatic gearspring machine.  dark mist astral: hmhm. it is pointless to keep fighting. bronk: next, i remove three counters from automatic gearspring machine, to summon*this*.. gearspring spirit.  bronk: with the power of gearspring spirit, <19:00> i can change one a' your monsters' attack points to *zero*, until the end a' this turn. dark mist astral: it *what*..  bronk: next i activate the spell card "monster reborn". so *come on back*, utopia.  tori: yeah, way to go, bronk.. dark mist astral: waitwhat is going on here.  dark mist astral: huh. yuma: hmhmhmhmhmhmheh, *way to duel*, bronk. dark mist astral: hold onyou are my servant. yuma: ha. bronk: yeah, his *body*, but not his mind, you said it yourself. dark mist astral: rrgh. bronk: see, it's gearspring catapult that's the key to winning this match. if you'd destroyed it, i wouldn't've had a *chance*. that's why yuma pretended to be your mindless servantto trick you into forgetting about my catapult. dark mist astral: i do not believe it.. yuma : you *better* believe it. the only people i serve are my buddies. bronk: i now activate gearspring catapult's effect. by removing one gearspring counter, <20:00> utopia gains five hundred attack points.  dark mist astral: ugh... *i do not like this*. yuma: well then, you're gonna positively *hate* what's coming up next. d'ya feel it, bronk. i sure do. bronk: you bet. i'm *feelin' the flow*..  dark mist astral: this cannot be.. bronk: go, rising sun slash..  dark mist astral: no way. ii lost.... impossible..  bronk: heyyuma, heads up..  yuma: thanks.  astral: ohh.   yuma: you did it, bronk. bronk: thanks, pal.  bronk: an' thanks for setting me up for that *way awesome combo move*.  yuma: uhhh...  yuma: yeah, it's uh, my pleasure.  bronk: *oh*, it was *astral's* idea, *huh*. yuma: no way. of course not. astral had nothing to do with it. you know, for the most part... bronk: i knew iti *figured* it was too smart a plan for *you*.  yuma: what.. *how dare you*. i bet you wish you were *half* as smart as me.  bronk: well, yuma, i'm smart enough to take *that* bet. yuma: why i oughta... astral: only friends so close, fight so much. yuma: ... you gotta lotta nerve.... bronk: i demand an apology.  astral: if only *all* fighting could be so harmless. number ninetysix... are there more memories like you. end <21:50> * special thanks to animeratio.com for the copy of this episode transcribed online. * special thanks to yugioh wikia as a source for checking cards. * special thanks to
