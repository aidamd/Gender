they had things to do. i really didn't feel like bothering them. astral: are they not supposed to go.  yuma: nahit's really no big deal, they went *last* year.  yuma: all right. i can still make it in time. i am *feelin' the*  yuma: oh no. no.  yuma: no. no. no. astral: what is wrong. yuma: it's gone.. my key is gone. aaaaaaaaaaaahhh.... astral: what.. where is it. act 2 <5:31>  astral: do you really believe it simply *fell from your neck*. we are going to have to retrace your steps *exactly*. yuma, this is very important to me. yuma: it's pretty important to me too, ya know. i didn't just find that thing lyin' around. my *dad* gave it to me. astral : his *father* gave him the key.  astral : what could this mean. could yuma's *father* have some connection to me and my purpose here. <6:00>  astral : this is most intriguing.  yuma.  yuma: huh. astral: can you tell me about your father. yuma: whaddaya wanna know. astral: what kind of person is he.  yuma: mm.. he's the *fun* kinda person. he hates sittin' around, he loves adventure... in fact, this one time he took me along with him on one of his expeditions.  fb young yuma: ahh...  fb kazuma: what's wrong, yuma.  fb kazuma: you didn't look *down*, now, didja. fb young yuma: i can't do it. i can't *go* any further. fb kazuma : what're you sayin', we're almost *there*. fb young yuma: but i'm, i'm scared.  fb young kari: aaaggh. this is *totally unfair*.  fb young kari: how come yuma got to go climbing with dad and i didn't.. fb grandma: are you saying you don't *want* to help me prune my awardwinning chrysanthemums today. fb young kari: yeah, grandma... <7:00>  fb young kari: ugh, it's *just not fair*.  oh, well... it must be *really nice* being the favorite... fb mira: don't be so dramatic. your father just wanted to spend some time with yuma.  fb mira: i have an idea. why don't we go and treat ourselves to a big, fancy dinner. fb young kari: okay. now we're talkin'.  fb young kari: ohh, let's get italian. breadsticks, or, ohohoh, maybe a *movie* afterwards. either way, *let's go*.  fb mira: well, you might want to put your shoes on first.  fb kazuma: hey, pal. i got a question for ya.  fb young yuma: hmm. what is it. fb kazuma: everything okay. your mom tells me something happened at school last week.    heheh. you lose.   just give up dueling. you'll *never* be any *good*.  sfb young yuma: no way. 'cause one day, i'm gonna be an *awesome duelist*.  yeah, of course you are*not*. <8:00>  sfb young yuma: i'm gonna be *great*.. *just wait and see*...   fb young yuma: ... it was nothing. no biggie. fb kazuma : uh*huh*... fb young yuma: but, like... dad. fb kazuma: what, yuma. fb young yuma: i, just, don't wanna go to school anymore. fb kazuma: why not. fb young yuma: because it's just fb young yuma: ... too hard. fb kazuma: yuma, we live in a *complicated world.* fb young yuma: what're you talking about.  fb kazuma: well, for starters, the world we know isn't the *only* world. there are actually *multiple* worlds, all connected. fb young yuma: uh. fb kazuma: let me show you.  fb kazuma: so, over here, we have a world full of adventure and possibility.  fb kazuma: but then, over here, we have a world of negativity, with people saying 'no' all the time.  fb kazuma: what's crazy is these worlds exist in the *same place*.  fb young yuma: huh. seriously. fb kazuma: you bet.  the people who live in *this* world inhabit the same time and space <9:00> as the people who live in *this* world over here. fb young yuma: ah....  fb kazuma: take those kids at school for instance. sounds like *they* live in the *negative* world.  *you*, on the other hand, you live in the world of possibility, where people dare to dream. fb young yuma : i do. so how can i stay in this world forever.  fb kazuma: that's an easy one, little rascal. you keep looking to the future, and dreaming big and setting goals for yourself. fb young yuma: what kind of goals. fb kazuma: *any* kind.  fb kazuma: you just have to listen to your heart, and *feel the flow* of everything surrounding you. you decide *who you want to be*, and then you go out and you *be* that person. don't you have any *dreams*, yuma. fb young yuma: huh. who, me. well, yeah, i wanna... my dream is to one day become a *world champion duelist*. but, like, when i *tell* people that, they laugh and make fun of me. fb kazuma: ahh, because *those* people don't live in *our* world. fb young yuma: they don't. fb kazuma: they're trapped in the other world. the world full of doubt and negativity. fb young yuma: oh... <10:00> fb kazuma: it's nearly *impossible* for people stuck in that world to dream, to imagine the *endless possibilities*. *those* people can only see what *is*.  fb kazuma: but what they cannot see, is what could *be*. they're not *adventurers* like you and me.  fb kazuma: yumaalways challenge yourself. don't be afraid to do what others tell you you *can't* do. all right, whaddaya sayare you up for a little duel. fb young yuma: here. *right now*. fb kazuma: sure. it's gonna be great. and then tomorrow...  fb kazuma: you and i'll climb even higher. act 3 <10:34>  yuma: my dad's the *best*. when i told him i wanted to be a duel champion, he was like 'go for it'. that's one of the reasons i *never* give up. i mean he taught me *so much* that calling it quits would be like *betraying* him.  yuma : we used to have the best duels.  fb kazuma: attack..  fb zubaba knight: zubabaaa.  fb kazuma: all right, here goes. i overlay my levelfour gogogo golem and ganbara knight.  fb kazuma: with these two monsters, i build the overlay network.. fb young yuma : ahh... fb kazuma: i xyzsummon. ohh, i forgoti don't have any xyz monsters in this deck.  fb young yuma: aahh. you *forgot*. fb kazuma: hahahahahahahaha.  fb young yuma: hey, dad. fb kazuma: yeah. fb young yuma: what's *your* dream. fb kazuma: oh. well, um, mine is a simple one.  fb kazuma: to journey. to discover the edge of the world.  fb kazuma: what're you laughing at. fb young yuma: hehee, you wanna go to the *edge of the world*. that's just *goofy*, dad. everyone knows the world is *round*. it doesn't have any *edges*.  fb kazuma: well, i guess you *do* have a point there... fb young yuma: you would just *fall right off*. hahahaha.  yuma : we were cracking up, but, <12:00> maybe i had it all wrong.  astral: what do you mean, 'had it all wrong'.  yuma: a little while later, he and mom were on an expedition.  yuma : they had gotten lost in a snowstorm, separated from their team.    fb kazuma: what was that, mira. the ground's shaking.  fb mira: kazuma..  fb mira: i've got you.. hang on. <13:00> i canpull you up. kazuma.  fb kazuma: mira....  fb mira: kazuma. don't do it.. fb kazuma: you can't pull me up. you'll fall in *with* me. don't worry, mira. i'm gonna be fine. trust me. i'm in *really good hands.*  fb mira: ohh, *noooo*. kazuma. no...   yuma : it's like he *experienced* something in that light, and, like, he *knew* that he was gonna be okay. fb kazuma: what *is* this place. that *light*... is this... *the edge of the world*.  fb kazuma: whoa....   yuma : a search team found my dad a couple days later. he was holding the key.  fb young yuma: daddy. fb kari: you okay.  fb kazuma: hhey, there, yuma. you been a good boy. fb young yuma: mmmhmm.  fb kari: we've been so worried, dad. you've been missing for days.   yuma: he said he'd traveled to the *edge of the world*. astral: how is that possible. yuma: i have no idea. astral: did he say anything else. yuma: nothing that made much sense. he was going on about *lights*, and different worlds. the doctors said it was just dehydration and exhaustion talking. i have no idea.   astral : yuma's father found the key on that journey. perhaps it unlocks a *door* of some sort, a door connecting *this* world to *another* one...  <15:00> yuma: ah... oh yeah*i remember when he gave it to me*.  fb young yuma: ha.   next, i activate my "soul of fire" spell card. fb young yuma: whaaaaa.   hahahaha. that *pretty much does it*.  maybe take some *piano lessons* or somethin'.  fb young yuma: this duel isn't over yet, ya got that.. ah.   so then *beat* mesince you're such a *great duelist*.   show us your *greatness*.  you can't defeat him and you know it.  you couldn't defeat a *donkey*.  fb young yuma: you're right... i can't win. fb kazuma: don't give up, yuma.  fb young yuma: dad. fb kazuma: remember what *world* you're in. fb young yuma: whwhadda you mean. fb kazuma: you live in the world where *anything is possible*. just feel the flow. it's all around you.  fb kazuma: yuma... let that key always remind you that you have the power to unlock your potential, and be who you wanna be.  fb young yuma: i *can* do this.  fb young yuma: thanks, dad. i'm *never* gonna give up.  fb young yuma: i am *feelin' the flow*..   yuma: mom and dad went missing after that, and... no one's heard from them since. act 4 <16:32>  flip: ohh... kazwell: look at tori's mom. flip: she's like an *angel*.  bronk's mom: why was six afraid a' seven. bronk : because *seven ate nine*.   tori's mom: hey, how come your friend yuma isn't here, tori. tori: i dunno...   yuma: okay, uh, *now* i feel dumb. astral : so, then, <17:00> it has been hanging here the whole time.  yuma: it must've fallen off in my sleep, and when i woke up late i didn't notice.  yuma: at least mom and dad were watching over it.  grandma: how is your *garden*, meredith. meredith: my chrysanthemums are blooming wonderfully.  grandma: oh, how nice.  meredith: and i've registered my primrose bushes to be judged in the annual gardenfest.  grandma: now, didn't your lovely *begonias* take home the blue ribbon last year.  meredith: it was my gladioli, actually. old
