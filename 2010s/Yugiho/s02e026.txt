  act 1 <<2:51  astral: noooooooo..  trey: now. let's see if you've got the guts to defeat me. *come on*. yuma: i... i can't.... i'm too scared.  trey: stand up and *fight me*, yuma. it's your turn. i told you to *stand up*.. you coward. yuma: no.  i won't. i'm not strong enough to take on monsters as terrifying as yours. cathy: come on, yuma. flip: what's he *up* to.. kazwell: what's wrong. bronk: rrrgghh, *hey yuma*.. will ya quit goofin' around.. get it in gear.. ya gotta draw a new card, like, *now*.  yuma: oh, yeah. it's my turn yuma: i hope i don't mess this up....  yuma: here i go.  yuma: i summon... i don't... ugh, i don't know which card to pick. ... guess i'll just forfeit the duel.  act 2 <<4:02  trey: hahahaha. without the sense of adventure you got from your father, you can't feel the flow.  bronk: i don't *get* it... cathy: what's wrong, yuma. trey: i not only took your friend's *confidence*, but his most important *ally*, too.  trey: see for yourself.   tori: it's astral.... flip: what's *he* doin' up there.  trey: i used my new powers to immobilize him. and i also turned yuma into a *quivering coward*. bronk: what a lowdown move. kazwell: that guy's a real snake.   flip: yuma, ya gotta fight to free astral. trey: he's too *cowardly* to fight. yuma's turned into a quitter. but if you think i'm gonna let you off the hook that easy, you're *wrong*. 'cause i'd rather break you and take *everything* from you.  yuma: but... trey... trey: this is the *end*, yuma. of your *last duel ever*.. you're *through*...  kazwell: look out. bronk: yuma can still pull through 'cause he's got gogogo golem. trey: i don't *think* so 'cause i'm playing *this*chronomaly mud golem..   trey: since yuma's monster can't be destroyed in battle when it's in defense mode, you guys thought he was safe. but yuma's *anything* but safe. all right, mud golemattack with lectro laser.  trey: check *this* out, yuma. due to mud golem's special ability, if it has more attack points than your monster's defense points, you take the difference as damage.  yuma: whaaaaaa. trey: next up, i'm using my "heart of stone" spell card. it lets my monster do even *more* damage. with this spell, if mud golem failed to destroy your monster in battle, it can attack again.  trey: okay, mud golem. take out gogogo golem with another laser blast.  yuma: whaaaaaaa.  bronk: yuma. trey: now to *complete* my victory.  trey: it's time, machu mech. attack with meteor meltdown.  astral: yuma. ugghh.  astral: i'll use the last of my strength, to remind youyou *must feel the flow*..   astral : you must remember who you truly are, yuma.   yuma : what *is* all this *stuff* i'm seeing.....  yuma : can i *really be* this strong..   yuma : huh. i wonder if.... ah.  yuma: yes. i summon gagaga gardna. block that attack.  trey: *block* it. kazwell: that was an incredible move.. yuma was able to call up gagaga gardna 'cause he's being attacked directly.  astral: oh no. yuma.  trey: how did he think to use that card.... of course..  trey: *astral* helped him. i have *had it*, with your interfering..   astral: uugghhuuuggghhhh..... flip: hhhuh. he can't take it. the energy's too intense.  trey: *be gone*..   astral: aaaaaaaaaauuugghh... *do not give up*, yuma....    tori: no...  trey: now you'll have to survive this duel on your *own*, yuma.   bronk: hang on.. kazwell: it's okay, bronk. don't forget. this is all *virtual*.  kazwell : even if yuma falls, he won't *really* get hurt. bronk: wrong, kazwell. if yuma lets go a' the edge, he's fallin' for *real*. kazwell : oh yeah, that's right. oh no.   kazwell : how could i forget.. this place is actually a superhighway that's under construction over the ocean.  kazwell: yuma, hang on..  bronk: *gotcha*. let's reel 'im in, you guys. yuma: why are you guys helping me.... bronk: 'cause we're your pals. don'tcha remember, yuma.. yuma: ah. but i thought none of you *liked* me. tori: sure we do. cathy: a lot.  kazwell: that's why we're friends. flip: and always will be.  bronk: man, you're a lot heavier than ya look.  bronk: it looks like trey's been messin' with your memory bank. he's tryin' to make you believe you're nothin' but a loser.  bronk: but the *real* yuma doesn't let anything stand in his way. you're the bravest guy that i know and you *never* give up..  yuma: i'm trying to remember... but i can't seem to... rrgghhh. trey: i hate to interrupt your *powwow*...  trey: but i need to do some *crowd control*. hahahaha.  yuma: aaaaahhhh.  trey: and nowwe can finally settle this, yuma.  trey: sorrybut as long as you're trapped in that prison yuma can't hear you.  bronk: you *scum*.. let us out...  tori: yuma...   kazuma: it appears that yuma's in grave jeopardy.  kazuma: his opponent has devised a devious plan. power alone won't be enough to overcome it.  kazuma: yuma...  kazuma: you must remember the most important thing of all..   tori: ah....  trey: what..  kazuma : and now, yumaremember. remember all that you have learned from me.   yuma : wait... that *can't* be me.  yuma : i'm not brave or bold like the yuma i'm seeing here.  yuma : or, *am i*....  did i do those things.  tori: yuma.  tori: catch.   vision kazuma : yuma, remember everything i passed on to you. remember who you truly *are*.  yuma: that's right. i'm not scared of *any* challenge. i just have to *go for it*.  yuma: i am feelin' the flow... hah. act 3 <<12:27  yuma: hah. cathy: he's back to normal.  tori: it's true.  trey: i don't believe it. *you broke the power of the crest*.. yuma: that's right.  yuma: you can't erase the things my father taught me. trey: i *can*by erasing *you* just like i did *astral*. yuma: whaddaya mean.  yuma: ah. astral.  you tell me where astral is. trey: i already told you. astral's *been erased*. yuma: what does that mean. trey: it means he's goneand you'll *never see him again*. yuma: no way..  yuma : i don't believe you, trey. trey: then you don't believe your *own eyes*. you saw him vanish yourself.  trey : he never had a chance.  trey : *unfortunately*, my powers were *too much* for astral.   yuma: you'relying. that's not truuuuue... it's just like all the other *lies* you put inside my head.. i'm right, guysaren't i.  yuma: i'm telling you, he *can't* be gone. trey: there's no use denying it, yuma. you're never going to see your friend astral again.  yuma: astral... trey: there was *no other choice*, yuma. i *must* win this for my family. now, let's finish our duel. we'll play out these last moves with the help of my "chronomaly city babylon" field. it lets me banish my chronomaly aztec mask golem from my graveyard, so that i can summon cabrera catapult in defense mode.  trey: and now i hand things over to you.  trey: too bad you only have *four hundred lifepoints* left, and i have cabrera catapult, and number thirtythree machu mech on my field. you have *no chance* of making a comeback now. especially since you don't have your friend *astral* to help you. hahaha.  yuma: i*am* gonna win this duel. i'll do it, for astral.  yuma: i *promise*.. i'm gonna highfive the sky...  hyah.  vision astral: no matter what happens to me, your future is *truly limitless*.   yuma : that's right. astral is still with me. in my memory. and he always will be... as long as i remember all the things he taught me.  fb astral: first, you must understand your opponent's strategy. even the most powerful deck will be useless, if you allow your *opponent* to control how the duel plays out.  yuma : trey's plan is to use cabrera catapult and machu mech as a combo. if he pulls it off, it's *game over*.  fb astral: once you know your opponent's strategy, *shut it down*.   yuma : that means i have to destroy trey's cabrera catapult *or* his machu mech.  yuma: what's that.. i seeastral must've left it for me.  fb astral: the rest is up to you.  fb astral: *feel the flow*, yuma.   yuma : i will.  yuma: i promise, astral. i'll fight this duel like you're *still with me*.  yuma: we'll win this thingand we'll do it together.. i activate, the equip spell "gagagarevenge". by doing that, i'm able to return a gagaga monster from my graveyard.  yuma: come on back, gagaga magician.   yuma: and i'm not done yet. i summon flelf. it's as mighty as a cyclone. once a turn, i can send a monster in my hand to the graveyard yuma: and then flelf's boosted by that monster's level.  yuma: overlay eater is level two, so when i send it to the graveyard, that pumps up flelf to level four.  trey: this... isn't good.  yuma: and it's gonna get even *worse*, 'cause i'm gonna overlay flelf to gagaga magician in order to xyz summon, number thirtynineutopia..   trey: *that* again. yuma: astral left me this number to help me stop you and to give me hope. trey: *what* hope.. you only have four hundred lifepoints left. yuma: that doesn't matter. if i had *one* point lefti'd *still* keep trying to win this duel.  yuma: i'll *never* give up, trey, 'cause i am *so* feelin' the flow. now i activate the effect of my equip spell, gagagarevenge. since i used gagaga magician to xyz summon, my xyz monster gains three hundred attack points, buffing up utopia's strength.  yuma: you're all set, utopia. take it to machu mech.  yuma: rising sun twinblade blast..  yuma: way to go, utopia.  trey: what..  trey: aaaaahhh.  trey: how can you duel like this, without astral. yuma: you don't understand, trey. astral will always be a part of me no matter what. nothin' you can do to me will change that. trey : it *doesn't matter*. your luck is *all used up*.. yuma: *you're* the one out of luck. trey: i still have plenty of surprises up my sleeve.  trey: you'll see..  hah. here's how a *great* duelist gets it done. i tribute my cabrera catapult so i can summon chronomaly sol monolith.   trey: by *summoning* my monolith, i can pick another monster on my field and change it to level six. and that's what i'm gonna do to *mud golem*..  trey: then i'll *overlay* my levelsix mud golem with my sol monolith.  trey: with these two monsters, i build the overlay network and xyz summon. it's hopeless, yumayou and your puny monsters are about to get squashed like *ants*. reveal yourself, number sixchronomaly atlandis..   yuma: whoa. i'm in bigtime trouble now. act 4 <<19:47  yuma: that's an *allnew number*.... trey: now, atlandisit is time..  trey: atlandis can equip itself with a number from my graveyard and gain its attack points.  yuma: you're equipping it with machu mech..  bronk: *five thousand* attack points..... kazwell: how's yuma going to survive an attack by *that*. yuma: rrrggghhh... trey: atlandis, take out utopia...  trey: eternal devastation...  yuma: utopianow. use an overlay unit to stop that attack.  yuma: go, lightwing shield.  yuma: oh, yeah. trey: hold it. yuma: huh. trey: atlandis has more power than you realize. it's gonna use its *other* ability..  trey: and you're taking a *direct hit*. by using one overlay unit, atlandis wipes out half your lifepoints. orichalcum .  tori: yumaaaaa..  trey: i *knew* you'd never survive without astral.  trey: this duel is *over*..  end <<21:24 * special thanks to
