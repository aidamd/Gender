astral: are you sure this is a good idea.  astral: trey believes that you stand in the way of his family's plans. that belief will make him *quite difficult* to defeat. yuma: i *know that*. but i also know that he's *better* than he pretends to be. that's why i *have* to duel him. the only way i can *really* learn what's in trey's heart, is to accept his challenge. that's a *fact*. astral: ...indeed. i concede your point. on the other hand, you have only collected *four* heart pieces so far. you will not advance in the tournament unless you win this duel. tori: yuma.  yuma: hey, guys. you came for the duel. bronk: we wouldn' *miss* it. cathy : that's right. there's a lot riding on this matchup. flip: yeah, we'll have to cheer you on to victory. kazwell : *or* offer our friendly support when you go down in flames. yuma: gggnnaaahhh. you guys really think i could *lose* tonight, don'tchaaa. flip: it was a *joke*. we *all* have *confidence* in you. kazwell: we *know* you'll winfor sure.  bronk: trey may have lotsa cool *cards*, and some tricky moves but in *our* book you're *numero uno*. tori: i agree. cathy : and that goes for *me*, too. yuma: thanks, guys.  yuma: i *will* win this thing.. bronk, tori, cathy, kazwell, flip: hooray.. yuma: let's go. bronk: last one there's a *broken litterbot*.   vetrix: what's *wrong*, quentin. you seem *worried*. quentin: that envoy from astralworld may be more powerful than you realize. vetrix: don't trouble yourself. trey's triumph is assured.   vetrix: the procedure was grueling, but trey's power has increased significantly. quentin: but will it be enough to defeat yuma. vetrix: hmhmhmhmhm, hmhmhmhmhm, ahahahahahahahahahahaha.  act 1 <<3:20  yuma: hope i didn't keep ya waiting *too* long. trey: you'll wish you never came here at *all* once you see the new power that *i've acquired.  yuma: you... worked out at the gym. astral : he means new abilities. yuma: uugghh... trey: meeting your family and seeing you together made me think, about my *own* family. i wanna see them *all happy*, like they used to be.  trey : but i can't help them as long as *you're* standing in my way.  yuma: can't you see that all i wanna do is just *help* you.. that's why i'm duelingto help us become real friends, who respect and trust each other. i *know* that can happen.  yuma: if it weren't for dueling, i wouldn't have made friends with *all of these guys*. and trey, i'm sure the same thing is gonna happen after we have *our* duel. you ready.. trey: yes.. but i promise you trey: we'll *never* be friends..  yuma: duel disk go..  yuma: duel gazerlet's roll.  computer: augmented reality vision link established.  yuma and trey: let's duel.. act 2 <<4:35  yuma and trey: let's duel..  trey : i'm drawing *first*, yuma.  and i won't show any *mercy*..  trey : first i'll see if the powers i received from vetrix paid off.  trey : that's *incredible*. i can see astral clearly. he must be helping yuma during his duels. but that won't be enough to keep yuma from *losing*, *this* time.  trey: i activate a field spell"chronomaly city babylon".  bronk: ugh, where *are* we.  yuma: amazing.... trey: yes it is. and what's even *more* amazing, is that now i get to summon *this*. chronomaly tula guardian.  trey: i can summon this card when my babylon field is active. it gives me a gigantic advantage. and to *add* to all your troubles, i'm summoning chronomaly golden jet.  trey: i'm activating golden jet's special ability. once per turn, i can increase its level.  astral: yuma, get ready. trey: i overlay my levelfive golden jet and tula guardian.  trey: with these two monsters i build the overlay network, and xyz summon number thirtythreechronomaly machu mech.   yuma: whoa. didn't take 'im long to bring a number out. trey: i place one card facedown and end my turn. your skills are no match for my new power, yuma. *i will outduel you*. yuma: if you think this duel is just about winningthen you don't understand *anything*. dueling is *more* than that. it's about trying your best and highfiving the sky. trey: sorry, yuma but you've highfived the sky for the last time. yuma: i don't think so.  i'm just gettin' *started*, trey. all right. my move. astral: *hold back*, yuma. yuma: huh. astral: remember that trey has machu mech on his field. you *must focus on defense*.  astral : i sense that he is determined to prevail in this duel, no matter *what* the cost.  be careful. attacking trey recklessly, may cost you the duel.  yuma: fine. then i'll play it safe. uh... i guess this monster will do the trick.  yuma: i also play a facedown, and end my turn. trey: my draw.  aah. and i'll kick things off my activating my "palenque sarcophagus" spell.  trey: i can use this whenever i have a chronomaly card on my field. it permits me to take two more cards from my deck.  trey: in fact, there's a certain monster i can summon from my hand whenever i activate a spell. meet the mighty ancient warriorchronomaly aztec mask golem.   yuma: i saw that before....  fb trey: sorry for geeking outbut this collection is *incredible*. it's just like the stuff in my favorite cards. look.  fb yuma: isn't that an *aztec mask golem*.   trey: aztec mask golem. attack. show me what yuma's hiding. palenque power pummel.    trey: i *knew it*. it's gogogo golem. astral: with only fifteen hundred attack points, trey's attack has failed. yuma: gogogo won't get a scratch.  astral: good work. because your golem was in defense mode, it is indestructible once every turn. yuma: which means gogogo is safe even if trey attacks with machu mech. trey: but i'm not out to *get* your monster. i've got something very special planned with my chronomaly cabrera catapult.   yuma: he summoned a monster with zero attack points. trey: but it has quite the powerful *special ability*.  trey: by getting rid of one monster on my field, cabrera can then chain up one of *your* monsters.  yuma: not cool. trey: wrap up gogogo golem..  yuma: gogogo's helpless. astral: it also leaves *you* vulnerable. trey: now i'll activate *machu mech's* special ability. when a monster's attack points are changed, machu mech can use an overlay unit once per turn to deal damage to *you*, and that's gonna be a *big deal*, 'cause the damage equals the total change in attack points. *say goodbye* to eighteen hundred of your lifepoints, yuma. machu mech, take aim and fire. go, infinity cannon..  yuma: yaaaaahhhh. act 3 <<10:12 trey: go, infinity cannon..  yuma: yaaaaahhhh. ugh, unnghh....  trey: now that cabrera catapult has done its work, it switches to defense mode.  trey: i'm gonna *keep this up* 'til you're beaten. tori: ahh... flip: yuma is in *big trouble*.  yuma: i'll come backjust *watch me*.  yuma : trey *has* changed. he's dueling differently than he did in our last duel. but *how*. astral: remember. there are ways of defeating *any* strategy. even trey's. yuma: look, i don't *want* any advice. this timei've gotta win the duel on my *own*. astral: but yuma... yuma: it's my turn.  here i go.. i summon gagaga magician.  astral: arm it with an equip spell, now. yuma: astral, keep your lips zipped. i activate my "bound wand" spell.  astral: yumaremember that once each turn, you can modify gagaga magician's level. yuma : i *knoooow*.. it's not like i studied dueling *yesterday*. i'm changing gagaga magician's level to *eight*. excelleeent. now i'll activate bound wand's effect. time to make some magic.  yuma: since gagaga's a spellcaster, it increases its attack points by its level times a hundred.  yuma: hold on. what happens if he uses machu mech's special ability. astral : *not that you need my advice*, but trey would avoid using his monster's last overlay unit. the effect would do little damage. yuma: good news. gagaga, smash up that cabrera catapult. trey: i *saw* this attack coming. too bad for you, i had a card ready to block it. yuma: a trap. trey: "stone bola" not only negates *this* attack, but it'll keep your magician from attacking on your *next* turn, too.  yuma: i can't believe it. uugghh. trey : you can't stop me, astral. astral: yuma, put a card facedown. yuma : *be quieeeeeet*.. i'm doing this my way. and my way is to put a card facedown and end my turn. trey: what a waste of time. now your monster's level returns to normal, and it loses the extra attack points from your wand's effect.  trey: *all that work for nothing*. it's my movei draw. and now i activate, the effect of my chronomaly city babylon field spell. once per turn, i can banish *one* chronomaly monster from my graveyard, and that lets me summon *another* chronomaly monster from my graveyard that's the *same level*. so by banishing golden jet, nowi can bring my aztec mask golem *back*.   trey: next i'll switch cabrera catapult into attack mode again, so i can arm it with aztec mask golem.  yuma: that's sick.... trey. i can't *believe* you're treating your monsters that way. trey: well, *believe* it. these monsters of mine are nothing more than a *means to an end*. yuma: you told me once that you *liked* chronomaly cards. what happened. trey: *you* happened, yuma. because of you my monsters now have to suffer.. yuma : but trey... trey: i'm using my cabrera catapult's ability. bronk: *again*. flip: if he does another combo with *machu mech's* special ability, yuma will be in *bigtime* trouble.  cathy: when it's over, he'll only have three hundred lifepoints left. kazwell: then trey just has to attack with machu mech to finish yuma off. he doesn't stand a chance...  astral: at lastthe moment i have been waiting for.  astral: use "gagagarush". do it now. yuma: huh. okay. i play the trap, "gagagarush". since you targeted my gagaga magician, this trap negates your monster's special ability, and destroys it.  yuma: next, the trap checks the attack and defense points of your monster, and whichever one of them is *higher*, that amount comes right back atcha as damage. trey: as *damage*..  yuma: since your catapult has eighteen hundred defense points, you'll get hit with the exact same amount.   tori and cathy: way to go.. cathy: i *knew* you'd do it 'cause i'm your biggest fan. tori: huh.  yuma: that was *perfect*. heyhow'd you *know* we should be ready to spring that trap. astral: trey is so obsessed with winning, it has blinded his judgment. he *cannot fool me*. he is predictableunlike you, who can *never follow a strategy*...  yuma: is that *supposed* to be a compliment. astral: *we can win this*. right now. yuma: huh. okay.  but i want *more* than that.  yuma : astral, i wanna help trey so he can duel like his *true self* again.  trey : the combination of yuma's dueling skills and astral's strategic abilities... is too great even for my new power to overcome. yuma: listen, treywhy d'you keep sacrificing your monsters. it isn't your style of dueling. am i right. trey: hngh. yuma: i dunno anything about the new *power* that you've got. but you should duel your *own* way.  trey: you'll never understand. when my family was torn apart, i was completely alone. without my father and brothers, i felt *lost*... but when i *did* get them back, everything had changed for the worse. yuma : what happened to them.  trey: why should *you* care.. anyway, my family is all that i've *got*.. i *won't let them down*..  yuma: what's wrong. trey: *nothing*.  trey: i'm just trying my new power on for size, so i can *destroy you*..  astral: yuma.  yuma: my golden key.... what's going on.  yuma: ah..  yuma: waaaaaaaahhhhhh.. act 4 <<16:33  vetrix: having a deck full of powerful number cards won't be enough to defeat this *tsukumo* kid.  vetrix : yuma's father was the great adventurer *kazuma* tsukumo.  vetrix : and it would be *unwise* to underestimate his son. vetrix: but the crest given to trey will rob yuma of *everything* he inherited from his father. yuma will sink into despair and never recover.  vetrix : then he'll no longer threaten our plans.  yuma : i'm feelin' the flow...  yuma : i'm feelin'...  yuma : i'm feelin... i...  yuma : wait...  yuma : what was i saying. ... i can't... remember.... it feels like i'm forgetting... something *really important*...  yuma : butwhat is it.   fb young yuma: ahh...  fb kazuma: what's wrong, yuma.  fb kazuma: you didn't look *down*, now, didja. fb young yuma: i can't do it. i can't *go* any further. fb kazuma : what're you sayin', we're almost *there*. fb young yuma: but i'm, i'm scared. fb kazuma: come on, yuma.  fb young yuma: huh. what did you say to me, dad.

fb tori: don't *you* wanna try a highdive, too.  fb yuma: i can't. i'm too scared.  fb yuma: it's just i have this thing about heights... fb tori: if you give it a try, maybe you'll see it's not as scary as you think.  fb yuma: i *won't dive*. i'm not gonna do it. it's *impossible*, tori. *impossible*.  fb bronk: the *perfect sweep*, that was *easy*. fb flip: haha, *yeah*. fb kazwell: nice goin'. it wasn't even *close*.  fb bronk: hey, i don't *get* it, yuma. why didja get freaked out by this *harmless little equip spell card*. fb flip: that was the *sorriest* excuse for a duel *ever*. fb kazwell: in the end, yumathat was just *embarrassing*.  fb bronk: *some* duelists never know when to *quit*. but *you* never even *started*.. let's go find a *real* duelistwho *tries*.  fb yuma: i can't... i *can't duel*.  huh. sorry.  yuma : my fault. i apologize.  fb yuma: everyone who looks at me... thinks i'm a *loser*. fb kazwell : yuma's a *reject*.  don't go *near 'im*or *you* could turn into a chicken.  he's so *pathetic*. group of students : loser. loser. loser.  fb yuma: why'm i so *scared*. i feel like i'm missing something.  fb yuma: huh....  fb yuma: whatever it was is gone for good. i... lost it forever.   astral: yuma, what is wrong. tell me.  yuma: i'm scared. what if... i lose. maybe i should just give up. astral: what has happened to you. yuma: i can't win this.  yuma: it's *totally impossible*. astral : *trey* used that crest to *change* yuma. trey: his unstoppable spirit no longer exists. and what's moreyuma cannot see you. astral: oh, no. yuma, you must not give in to fear or doubt. *listen*.  astral: ah.  *ugh*. trey: it's *too late*. you can't help him anymore.  astral: what now..  trey: i'm removing you from the equation, *astral*.  trey: this crest gives me the ability to immobilize you. you're *through*..  astral: ah.  trey: all that yuma learned from his father has been wiped from his memory. you're no longer able to feel the flow, *and* you can no longer see astral *or* the golden key. in other words, you're *harmless* to me. now, machu mech. destroy gagaga magician...  yuma: aaaaaaaaahhhhugnnnhhh...  astral: oh no*yuma*..  astral: aaaaaggghhhhnnnnggghhhaaaaaahhhh.. yumaplease hear me. trey: it's done. i've separated yuma and astral for good.  trey: hahahahahahahahahaha.  end <<21:29 * special thanks to animeratio.com for the
