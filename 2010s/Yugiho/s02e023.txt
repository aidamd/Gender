your brother, kite, but... you can't help him now.  nistro: *tell* mewhy didn't you inform the *rest of us* when you discovered that the original number had aligned with yuma tsukumo. kite: you *know* about that. nistro: we do. kite: well, *don't you worry*. i plan on dealing with him. nistro: *dealing* with him. you two just had a tagduel like a coupla *chums*. i hear you did well together. *i* will deal with him, kite. leave him to me. kite: you do *not* want to get in my way, nistro. *bad things* will happen.   dr. faker : oh, *hart*... i can't help but feel that this state you're in is *all my fault*. *dear boy*. mr. heartland: rest assured, doctor faker. my people are doing everything they can.  dr. faker: who did this to him, mister heartland. tell mewho took his power.. mr. heartland: according to kite's report, it was the group of individuals bearing a *powerful crest*. dr. faker: ... a *crest*. mr. heartland: *whoever* they are, they will no doubt show themselves in the duel carnival finals. dr. faker: and when they do, i want you to make them *pay* for this.. i don't care how you *do* it, heartland, but you *must recover hart's power*.. mr. heartland: yes, sir.  astral: you do not know how to *get* to astralworld.  yuma: that occurred to me.  yuma: but, when he disappeared...  yuma: my dad was looking for the *edge of the world*. so, that's what *i'm* gonna do.  astral: and what about the numbers. yuma: mm. astral: what about helping me recover my memories. yuma : come on, don't try to guilt me.  yuma: it's just... he's my dad. i've gotta bring him back.   yuma: all right, let's *do this*.  kari: so what's in the *bag*, yuma. are you *finally doing your laundry*. yuma: you're prob'ly not gonna believe me. but there's *something you need to know*. kari: is this about dad being in some *alternate universe* or something. yeah, tori told me everything. so what, you're gonna *go* to this other world. *false*. now just go back inside. yuma: lookas much as i'd love to sit an' *explain* all this, i *can't*. and now, if you'll excuse me yuma: later. kari: yuma, wait a sec.  yuma: don't worry dad, i'm gonna find you, no matter what it takes. roku: *so*, does this mean you're giving up on the duel carnival.  yuma: who's there. roku: up here.  roku: *long time no see*, yuma.  yuma: ah, haha.  yuma : master roku. it's been, like, forever since you kicked my butt in the sanctuary.  yuma: how've ya *been*, oldtimer.  roku: you have the look of someone who's running away from something.  *what are you running from*, yuma. yuma: ghah... well... act 3 <<12:44  roku: i wanted to see what my promising young pupil was up to. so i came down from the mountain, *expecting* to find you giving the duel carnival all you've got.  little did i know that you were facing *such a difficult situation*. yuma: oh, great, so it sounds like you understand. i'll be going now roku: not so fast.  roku: i hereby challenge you to a duel. yuma: eheh... thing is, i'm really not in a dueling *mood* right now, so ah... roku: *what*.. i am your dueling master.. and my request will *not be denied*... if you think you're ready to do what you're about to do, then *prove it*.  yuma: all rightlet's do this thing.  astral: *i* cannot lend you any assistance. i think you need to do this *alone*. yuma: i don't *need* and help proving myself. roku: bring it.. yuma: you asked for it, gramps. yah.  yuma: duel disk, go.. duel gazerlet's roll.  computer: authentic reality vision link established.  vetrix: i can feel hart's power beginning to awaken inside me.  yuma : it's my turn. i *draw*.  yuma: nice. that's what i was lookin' for. i'm summoninggagaga girl..  gagaga girl: gagaga.   yuma: how d'ya like *them* apples, oldtimer. my field is loaded with monsters ready to attack.  yuma: i can end this *right now*. gagaga girl is leading the attack. gagaga charge.. now, everybody. attack. roku: i reveal my trap card. "mirror force".  yuma: you destroyed 'em. *all* of 'em. roku: you were *so* impatient to end this that you didn't stop to strategize. yuma: yeah, welli've still got the advantage, oldtimer.  yuma: i end my turn. roku : hm. let's *look into* that advantage.  interesting. seems i'll be summoning queen's knight in attack mode.   roku: and now i'll summon the king's knight to *join* his queen.  roku: now, the virtuous couple is united. but the royal court is not yet complete.. when king's knight and queen's knight are both on the field, i can summon another card directly from my deck. time to make way for jack's knight...  astral: not good. roku: i activate "polymerization".  roku: with this spell, their powers fuse together to give rise to the defender of the imperial throne.. arcana knight joker..   yuma: it's got thirtyeight hundred attack points. *seriously*.. roku: you thought you had the advantage, but you were blinded by your impatience.  act 4 <<16:37  roku: this duel is over. arcana knight joker, attack yuma directly.. yuma: aaaaaaaahhh.  tori: yuma. yuma: dyrrrrggghhh. come on. *let's duel again*. roku: no. yuma: huh. roku: what are you so *impatient* for, yuma. in your current state you could *never* defeat me. right now, you're a *fool*all impulse and no thought. yuma: ah. it's just that...  i don't know what i'm s'posed to do.  yuma: if i help astral, hart gets hurt. but if hart's trying to destroy astralworld, and my dad's there, then... roku: so you decided, you would run *away* from your problem. yuma: it's not that. roku: running off to find your father is certainly brave in theory, but with you not knowing where to even start *looking*, really, it seems you're just *running off*. and look at all you'd be abandoning. your dueling, the carnival, your friend astralall that you've been fighting for and training for. i think you're scared to *face* your problem. but yumai want you to look at your feet. those feet are firmly rooted in dueling. you *can't just walk away from it*, no more than you can outrun yourself. dueling is the bond  roku : between you and your father. you must trust that the path of a duelist roku: will lead you to the answers you seek. yuma: okay... yeah. you're right.  i can *totally* do this. i just gotta take it *one duel at a time*.   vetrix: this power.. it's like nothing i've ever felt before.. even with the crest, i'm having a hard time controlling it.  vetrix: hope you're ready, doctor faker.  vetrix : soon, i will ruin you with the very power you so desire..  vetrix : your end is coming. hahahahaha. hahahahahahaha.  yuma: so, the guy who's put this whole duel carnival together. d'ya know anything about 'im. roku: every light casts a shadow. every puppet has a puppeteer. *that* is what i know.  yuma: huh. roku: mister heartland is just a face. he's a *smile* and a *voice*, but he is not the words.  yuma: are you saying there's some *secret mastermind* who *really* calls the shots. roku: the man who is said to have built heart land city was a *brilliant scientist*, named *doctor faker*. yuma: and what's *his* story. roku: his *story* is pretty much a mystery.  roku : is he still here. has he moved on.  roku : nobody knows much about him. that is most likely how doctor faker wants it to be.  grandma: he *did* leave one time. your father led him on an expedition.  grandma: in fact, it was your father's *last expedition before disappearing*.  astral: your father, doctor faker, and mister heartland are all connected. this cannot be written off as mere coincidence, yuma.  yuma : astral's right. i *have to keep going*.  yuma : i have to win the duel carnival. vetrix: what.. that boy, just now. quentin: yes. yuma tsukumo has teamed up with the original number. vetrix: did you say*tsukumo*. as in kazuma tsukumo's *son*..  quentin: yes.  vetrix: it can't *be*.. that's *impossible*..  trey : that figure i saw at the end of our duel...  trey : i'm certain it was him. the envoy from astralworld.  trey : but what's *yuma's* connection to him.  trey: ...yuma tsukumo...  trey: it's time to find out more about you.  astral: that card makes choosing the one *before* unnecessary. yuma : *you mentioned that*. but i want both cards in my deck so *both cards it is*.  astral : well, then at least protect it with that *trap card*. yuma: ... *which* trap card. astral: *that* one. right *there*.  yuma: let's *win this thing*, astral. astral: that is the plan.  yuma: *speaking* of plansya got one for roku's snoring. end <<21:26 * special thanks to animeratio.com for the copy of
