 fortuno: your fate has been sealed. it is useless to try to write what was already written in the stars many years ago.  fortuno: you believed that you would achieve greatness, but you're nothing more than a pawn in a game beyond your comprehension.  fortuno: and now, you will give me that which i seek.  this... isn't over. number sixteen, shock master, attack.  fortuno: hahahahahahaha. ah.   hey... who *are* you. tell me.  fortuno: you need not worry your hapless self about who *i* am, but who i have sworn allegiance to. and who's that.. fortuno: i serve at the pleasure of my great master kite. it is for *him* that i take not only your number card but your very *being.*  <1:00> ah.  fortuno: your bidding has been done, my master. another number card has been obtained.   act 1 <2:18>  yuma: look out, world, 'cause here comes *yuma*. that's right*someone* powered up his deck.  boom. how d'ya feel today, my *awesome* little darlings. feel like gettin' out there and takin' some *fools down*.. huh.  yuma: why d' *you* look so blue. astral: huh. ...i suppose it is just my pigmentation. or... perhaps something to do with light refraction. yuma: uhh, whaddaya *talkin'* about. i mean, why d'you look so *sad*. tori: hey. yuma. yuma: what's up, guys.  tori: something is going *down**that's* what's up.  tori: come on. we need to have a serious *chat*. yuma: *this* doesn't sound good... <3:00>  yuma: wha. what *happened* to these people..  bronk: nobody *knows* much. kazwell: they all went *missing* at one point, and ever since they were found, they seemed to have *aged* or something. and they just stare off into space, andbronk: drool. they're like *zombies*. kazwell: yuma, these people only have one thing in commonthey're duelists. bronk: and before they went missing, every single one of 'em had found a number card. yuma: uuaahh... seriously.  kazwell: in the end, yuma, since *you* possess a number card, it stands to reason that *you* are in danger. yuma: naaahh.  yuma: i'm sure it's just a biiig coinkidink. ah, anyone do the math homework. tori: you're hiding something. yuma: aahh. tori: *what do you know*, yuma. are number cards, likeyou know*dangerous*. yuma: ah*i* dunno, why would they be. tori: don't play dumb. yuma: aahh, i, uh, ii gotta go to the bathroom.  tori: what's he *hiding*.  astral: yuma... why are you keeping the truth from your friends. <4:00> yuma: i don' know. i guess...  yuma : i guess i don't want them to get involved with all the 'kite' stuff. the less they know, the better.  astral: i see. perhaps you are right. yuma: i guess all those people in the news were people that kite hunted down.  wellmaybe we should hunt *him* down so that we can go ahead and put 'im in his place.  astral : and how do you propose we... put him... in his place. yuma: hmph. are you telling me that you're still scared a' that jerk..  yuma: astral. if you wanna get your memories back, then sooner or later were gonna hafta defeat kite and *get those number cards*.  astral: and what happens if we lose.. kite gets to add your soul to his growing collection, and i vanish away to who *knows* where. yuma: that's why we won't *lose*, astral. ...ah.  cathy: uh... hello, yuma.  yuma: ah, man. you scared me. what're you doing up here, cat.  cathy: you remembered my name. um... who're you talking to.  yuma: aaaah. y'know what, ii've got to go to the bathroom. <5:00> see ya later. buhbye, cat.  cathy: okay... well, *that* was weird.  fortuno: master kite.  fortuno: i present to you my latest conquest. number sixteen, shock master. now let us find out what *fate* holds next.  fortuno: i bring forth my fortuneteller's deck.  fortuno: the deck is showing me the signs. stray lambs in the dark. their shepherd will come looking for them. he will bring us another number.   yuma: see ya later. tori: hang *on*, yuma.  yuma: i, i, i gotta do some shopping for grandma. bye.  tori: *ugh.* escaped *again*.  <6:00> kazwell and bronk: mmmhmm. bronk: me 'n' kazwell got a little idea, tori.  tori: 'the super secret number card investigation club'. bronk: that's right. although, now that i hear *you* say it, i guess it *is* kind of a mouthful... kazwell: the point remains. if *yuma* isn't going to talk about number cards, then *we'll* have to uncover the mystery.  flip: diiid someone say *mystery*. tori: huh..  flip: i *looove* a good mystery. i am requesting membership in your club. bronk: *sure*, flip.  bronk : *hey*, in fact *you* had a number card at one point, right.  flip: i did. and i would be *more* than happy to tell you what i *remember* about my experience... tori: so, *tell* us. flip: what i remember is *absolutely nothing*.  bronk: that's a big help. cathy: um, hello.  cathy: i would like to join your investigation club as well. bronk, tori, flip, kazwell: uhhh... okay.  cathy: earlier today, i saw yuma having a conversation with himself. tori: ohh, yeah. he does that. <7:00> bronk: what was 'e talkin' about. cathy: numbers, and... flying kites. bronk: flying kites. what *'sat* about. tori: maybe number card people use kites to signal each other. all: hmmm... bronk: whatever. let's split up and track down some leads. tori: sounds good. we can *do* this. we're the super secret number card investigation club. all: all right. let's go. act 2 <7:25>  cathy: they say *dogs* are the best animals for tracking things down...  cathy: let's prove them wrong.   kazwell : there's certainly a lot of mystery surrounding these number cards. but *in the end*, everything has a logical explanation.   flip : a *mystery* is just a *puzzle*...  flip : a *puzzle* has *pieces*. *pieces* *fit together*. but *how*..  flip : and what if you don't *have* all the pieces. <8:00>  flip : or, the box that tells you what the puzzle's even supposeta *look like*.. *very curious*... tori: 'scuse me, um...  shark: why're you running around and asking people about number cards.  tori: oh. hey, shark. *d'you* know anything about number cards. shark: i know that they're *bad news*. and that you shouldn't go around asking *random strangers* about them. tori: whaddayou mean. why not. shark: this isn't a game that you wanna be *playing*, tori. leave it alone. go home.  tori: shark...   bronk: anyone *else* have any luck. cathy: not me... kazwell: not *me*, either. bronk: yeah, i got nut'n. kazwell: in the end, this mystery may *remain* a mystery.  flip: have no fear, *flip* is here.  flip: *sometimes* you've just got to look in unlikely *places*. which is *exactly* what *i* did.  <9:00> tori: uhhhh, what *is* this place, flip. flip: i was *told* that this mansion belongs to a *worldrenowned fortuneteller*. bronk: a *what*. flip: uh, a fortuneteller is someone who is *magical and allknowing*....  fortuno: and what have we here. stray little lambs looking for answers and guidance. i have been expecting you. follow me and i will lead you towards the *enlightenment* you are all seeking.  bronk: i got a *bad feelin'* about this. flip: *probably* the burrito you had for lunch... kazwell: sssshhhh.  tori: this place is like a museum. bronk: yeah, *haunted* museum. flip: ssshhh.  kazwell : where's he *taking* us.  bronk : uh... nice place. fortuno: i know why you're here.  you seek to gain knowledge about something that is *troubling you*. tori: how did you know.  fortuno: i see everything. what you're looking for, is... let's see...  fortuno: i'm seeing... a rectangle. something thin. i'm seeinga card. tori : huh.. flip and kazwell: ohh...  fortuno: and not just a *normal* card, a *powerful* card. it'sno. not one *specific* card, a *type* of card. bronk: yeah. we're lookin' forfortuno: ssshh. i'm seeing visions of fortuno: numbers.. bronk: how does 'e know *that*.. we never mentioned *anything* about no *numbers*. kazwell : it's gotta be some kinda trickery. flip: show some respect. there's no trickery in fortunetelling.  tori: sowhat else d'you see, do you see anything *more* about these numbers. fortuno: these numbers contain a great *evil*. tori : eeevil. fortuno: they seek to possess those who hold them. <11:00> they invade their hearts and corrupt their spirits. tori: so yuma, he.. he could end up like those people we saw...   fortuno: tell me... who is this *yuma*.  tori: our friend, hehe's got one of the number cards. we've been worried... because he won't tell us what he knows about it even though... we can tell... he knows something that he's not telling us. fortuno: unfortunately fortuno: my vision ends here. tori: your vision ends here...  fortuno: you have given me what the stars said you would, my dear little *lamb*. my master is going to be most grateful.  bronk: hey, tori. let's go. fortuno: actually, i was hoping that you could *stick around* a little...  bronk, tori, flip, kazwell: cat, go get help.. <12:00> fortuno : yes, go get help. act 3 <12:03>  yuma: stop all the *sighing*. it's really bumming me out.  yuma: that does it. we're totally starting up a *quarter jar policy*. cathy: yuma.. yuma: huh.  cathy: yuma. ohh, you have to *do* something. yuma: what exactly d'you need me to *do*. cathy: it's tori and the others, theyahh.  yuma: they what. spit it out. *cat*... cathy/fortuno: *cat* cannot hear you right now. yuma: wha.. what's going on with your voice.. cathy/fortuno: my name is fortuno. i am a seer of all things and i bring to you a message on behalf of my master, kite.  yuma: *kite*..  astral: oh, dear.... cathy/fortuno: we have your friends, yuma. if you want to see them again, you must come to my mansion and duel me. if you refuse my request, then your friends will be...  <13:00> cathy: aahh. yuma: will be *what*..  cathy: they'll be... aah.  cathy: what happened.. i must've blacked out or something. yuma: where is this *mansion*. you have to take me. cathy: yeah. follow me. astral: wait. yuma: huh. astral: *i do not like this*. we can't simply go running headfirst into what is clearly some sort of ambush. yuma: oh, well, whaddaya wanna *do then*, smart guy..  yuma: *stay here and do nothing*.. astral, my friends are in trouble. astral: you cannot save them if you cannot defeat kite.  yuma: huh.  astral : kite is skilled beyond anyone i have ever encountered. he is cunning and clever in ways that elude me.  astral: there is no guarantee that we can defeat him, yuma. yuma: so you think i should only duel people when i've a hundredpercent chance of victory.. astral: that is correct. yuma: huh. astral: my *very existence* is on the line when you duel, yuma. why would i encourage you to duel someone when i know you will lose to them. yuma: because we've. astral: if you run into kite's ambush right now, you will lose, and you will have failed to save your friends, and then i will<14:00> yuma: you don't know that i'll lose...  astral: yuma.  yuma: forget itit's obvious that you *don't wanna help me*.  whatever. i don't need *you*..   kazwell: nobody breathe. nobody sneeze. nobody panic. nobody move.. flip: somebody save me.. heeeeelp... tori: calm *down*, flip. yuma : tori. bronk.  bronk: yuma.  yuma: ah.... whoacheck it out. hey, guysyou okay..  cathy: why can't we *hear* them.  fortuno: *welcome*, yuma. so *glad* that you could make it. yuma : are you fortuno. you need to let my friends go, *right now*. fortuno: hmhmhmhmhmhmhmhm. i will *gladly* release them if you can defeat me in a duel.  fortuno: and i hope you don't mind, but my master kite will be spectating. <15:00> yuma: huh... astral: kite..  yuma: astral. i thought you weren't coming.  yuma: ...hey, astral. fortuno: master kitei, your humble servant, will defeat this boy and seize his number. yuma: you *think so*. fortuno: soon *your soul* will belong to my master. yuma: i don't think so, *pal*. soon you're gonna be lying on the floor without any lifepoints, and i'll be leaving with my friends.  yuma: duel disk, go. duel gazerlet's roll.  computer: augmented reality vision link established.  yuma and fortuno: let's duel. act 4 <15:49>  fortuno: *i'll* take the first move. prepare yourselfi draw. <16:00>  fortuno: i summon orange shaman in attack mode. ha.   astral : a monster with *no attack points*.... fortuno: with that i place one card facedown and *end* my turn.  yuma : get set to get decked, pal. i *draw*. i summon, gogogo golem.  yuma: aww, yeah. right now he can deal a lotta damage in a single strike. fortuno: hm. i activate orange shaman's special ability.  fortuno: since you summoned gogogo golem, orange shaman can usher *another* shaman to my field. appear before me, *red* shaman.   astral: zero attack points *again*. <17:00> you must *not attack* him. yuma: what are you, *nuts*. this is my *moment*, openings don't *get* any better than this. gogogo golem, attack. fortuno: hmhm. i reveal the trap, "dance of the guardian". this allows me to choose one card in your hand. and if it just *happens* to be a monster card, then your attack will be nullified.  fortuno: and i already know what you're holding. yuma: no you don't. it's not like you're some kinda *psychic* or something. cathy: yumahe *is*.  fortuno: you have five cards in your hand.  fortuno: there's only *one* monster card among them. that would be the *second card from the right*.  yuma: whoa. how did you..  fortuno: at this moment, dance of the guardian sends the card i selected to your graveyard, and i'm able to draw from my deck. yuma: no. gagaga magician. okay.... <18:00> i guess you *are* a psychic. astral: nothing that i have learned about the human mind would lead me to believe that a man is capable of this power....  does kite *also* have this ability. if so astral : stopping him *may be impossible*.  yuma: i mean, *seriously*how is that *fair*. astral: now, yuma, defend. you *must fortify* with that trap in your hand. yuma: mm. that's all i *can* do for now. i place one card facedown and end my turn. fortuno : it's *my turn*, then. i activate the spell "shaman call". when i have two spellcasters with zero attack points, shaman call grants me the power to summon *another* shaman from my deck. i summon *green* shaman to the field.   yuma: uhoh. astral: this is why he consecutively summoned two monsters that have no attack points. <19:00> fortuno: witness the power of those who see beyond time. watch in wonder as i overlay orange shaman, red shaman, *and* green shaman.  fortuno: with these three monsters i build the overlay network.  fortuno: i xyz summon, number sixteenshock master.   yuma: that thing is freakylooking. fortuno: behold, shock master's special ability. once a turn, i can use one overlay unit to negate the effect of a card type of my choosing. yuma: *any* type. fortuno: hmhmhmhmhm. that's correct, my boy, and the card type i choose can't be used for two turns. i can see it right now. the exact type of your facedown card. <20:00> astral: he knows.. fortuno: my vision grows clear. your facedown card is a trap. yuma: no way..  fortuno: i declare that trap cards *cannot be activated*.  fortuno: i *do hope* that you weren't planning on *using* that card to stop my attacks. yuma: uggghhh. fortuno: hahahahaha. shock master, take out gogogo golem.  yuma: uuuuaaaaahhh.   yuma: huh.  fortuno: oh, did i forget to mention. your friends' safety depends on you.  fortuno: the more lifepoints you lose, the more the rock on which they stand will *crumble*. yuma: not cool.... fortuno: are you prepared to bow before my power and before my master kite.. <21:00>   fb kite: and now your soul and number cards*will be mine*. galaxyeyes photon dragon, prepare to attack..  fb yuma: ahhh....  is this *it*. fb astral: i am afraid so. farewell.   astral : this feeling i have... this trembling in my spirit...  astral : i think i now understand what it means to... be *afraid*.  end <21:36> * special thanks to animeratio.com and toonzaki.com for the copies of this
