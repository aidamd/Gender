  act 1 <2:05>  scorch : you shouldntve messed with *us*, you two. you shouldve stayed at home in your *pajamas*. chills : i think my partner *meant* to say, you shouldve stayed in your crib, in your *diapers*.   tori: oh, no....  yuma: theyre *laughing* at us. shark: yeah, youre right. but dont worry, cause we have the advantage *now*, yuma. volcasaurus used up all its overlay units already. yuma: oh, right. so that means *no more special ability*. scorch: hm. that may be *true*, pipsqueak, but i didnt need it to take out shark *anyway*.  scorch: 'cause ya see, my volcasaurus can attack him *directly*.  yuma: look out.. shark: i activate my trap. "zeus breath". this card can blow off your monsters attack.  <3:00> scorch: it looks like you lucked out *this* time.  yuma: *that* was a close one.  chills: you think youre safe now. scorch: theres only *one way* this is endingyoure going to lose, and utopias gonna be ours. i place two cards facedown and end my turn. yuma: rrgh, *my* go, then. i draw. goblindbergh, take to the skies.   yuma: when goblindbergh flies to the front line, he can pick up a levelfourorbelow monster from my hand, and transport it to my field. so please welcomegagaga magician.  shark: i hope you know how to pull this off. astral: yuma. please wait. yuma: suddenly i am feelin the flow..  yuma: time for a little overlay action, with gagaga magician and goblindbergh. with these two monsters, i build the overlay network. i xyzsummonnumber thirtynine, utopia. <4:00>  tori: all right. now were talkin. bronk: ugh. i cant watch. its too lame. all he does is rely on *utopia*.  scorch: oooh... *look*, chills, a *number* card. chills: whatever will we *do*, scorch. oh waiti know. ill activate the "avalanche" trap card, and freeze your utopia in its tracks, preventing him from *ever* being able to attack.  yuma: ahhh. utopia.. chills: hahaha. how dya like *that*, kid. your big, bad monsters been *iced*. scorch: an guess what, if youre thinkin a using its special ability, dont *bother*, cause if you do, youll be takin five hundred points a damage. yuma: seriously.. but wait a minute, maybe i can still find a way ashark: *forget* it, yumathey shut utopia down. astral: you know, i tried to warn you. yuma: i place two cards facedown and end my turn. <5:00> scorch: of *course* youre ending your turn, pipsqueak. theres nothing else that you can *do*. chills: heh.  but theres a *lot more* that *we* can do. for instance, i can shift icebergdon into attack mode.  chills: and know what *else* i can do.. i can have icebergdon attack shark directly. bye bye, *traitor*.  yuma: the only thing going bye bye is your monsters attack. i activate utopias special ability. shark: yuma. dont. if you use that, youre gonna get slammed by that avalanche trap.  yuma: im not afraid to take a little damage.  yuma: go, lightwing shield.  chills: if a hurting is what you want, then a hurting is whatcha gonna get.  yuma: aaaaaaaahhhhh.  <6:00> bronk: if i didnt know any better, id be wondering if yuma summoned utopia, *just to protect shark*. shark: yumayou shouldna *done* that. chills: aww, *what* friendship. im so moved by this touching displayso moved that i think ill attack you again. pompadour blizzardon, attack shark directly.  yuma: i activate utopias ability.  yuma: go lightwing shield.  bronk: yuma. y all right..  yuma: *ugh*, that kinda smarts... shark: yuma. yuma: hm.  shark: are you just gonna *sit there*. or are you gonna stand up and *battle*.  yuma: mm. all right, *chumps*. i hope thats not the *best youve got*.  yuma: my *grandma* duels way better than you guys, and like, shes old. chills: i think pipsqueaks tryin to *trashtalk*. scorch: well *this* should shut im up. <7:00> i activate the "volcanic ash" trap card. using this card's power, i can put chills pompadour blizzardon in defense mode. yuma: uh... anyone know *why* he put his teammates monster in defense mode. chills: thanks for the hookup. haha. nowi activatethe power of the "frozen ice cave" spell card. it can increase the level of a monster on my field in defense mode. yuma: oh*thats* why.  chills: so pompadour blizzardon becomes *levelfive*. shark: thats *two* levelfives now. not good.  chills: i think you both know whats about to happen next. i overlay icebergdon and pompadour blizzardon.  chills: i hope you fellas brought your *jackets*, cause the weather outsides about to get *nasty*. i xyzsummon, number nineteen. freezerdon.   act 2 <8:09> yuma: shark. they got *two* number monsters. chills: and i think it's time i help out my partner's by activating freezerdon's special ability. so by using one overlay unit, i can restore all of *volcasaurus's* overlay units. yuma: no way. astral: that is quite an interesting tactic....  yuma: now that it's got its *overlay units* back, it can knock us around some more. shark: that's *convenient*. chills: i place two cards facedown, and end my turn.  chills: *no one* can stand up to the onetwo punch of fire and ice. astral: this is not right. something is strange... shark: ...they're *cheating*, yuma. yuma: they *are*.  chills: *cheating*. <9:00> what a sore loser. scorch: heh. shark: don't play dumbi know a cheater when i see one. and i'm lookin' at *two*.  astral: a 'cheetah'. does he mean a large cat. yuma: ugh. *cheater*, not cheetah. it's someone who breaks the rules. astral: you mean i see. they are being dishonest.  shark: *figures* you losers wouldn't play it straight. i'm gonna guess you worked out a tagteam strategy in advance. you figured out the cards you needed, then rigged your duel disks' shuffle system  to *give* 'em to you. yuma: no *way*.  yuma : that's why they both just *happened* to have levelfives in their hands when they activated those egg traps.  astral: so when scorch used volcanic ash to put chills's monster in defense mode...  astral : he did so knowing perfectly well that chills would *then* be able to increase blizzardon's level, by activating frozen ice cave. they *always* know what the other is holding, and what they will draw next.  astral: if that is truly the case, then these two are *not* true duelists. shark: i can't believe you guys call yourselves *duelists*. you're just a coupla cheating *nobodies*. chills: tread lightly, little *shark*. <10:00> cheating's not a word you wanna be *tossing around*. scorch: meaning the pot shouldn't call the kettle black. everyone knows *you* cheated during the nationals. shark: ah....  scorch: you *talk* like a champion, but a *true* champion  scorch : wouldn't peek at his opponent's deck in the waiting room during the finals..  fb male announcer: weeks of watching duelists *crush* each other's dreams have led *to this*. fb female announcer: that's right, ron  fb female announcer: the national duel tournament finals are here, and the excitement is fb young shark : this is it. *this* is my moment, i *have* to win this thing. fb male announcer: that's *right*, megan.  fb female announcer: i *know* it's right, ron.  fb male announcer: newcomer reginald *kastle* has managed to climb a *mountain* of obstacles to become the oddson favorite. fb female announcer: will he rise to this final challengefb young shark : is that his *deck*.  fb female announcer: or will he buckle under the weight of expectation and pressure.  fb female announcer: we'll find out, after a word from our sponsor.  fb young shark : i got this. just one more turn. <11:00> fb opponent: i place one card facedown and end my turn. fb young shark : a facedown card. it's gotta be  fb young shark : the card i saw before"mirror force".  fb young shark : this match is *mine*.  my turn. ihuh..  fb male announcer: whoa, ladies and gentlemen, *hold up*. can it be. *kastle has been disqualified*.  fb male announcer: security caught some footage of the hopeful finalist looking at his opponent's deck *minutes* before the duel started.   scorch: what happened after *that*. oh, rightthe league banished you for life, and now you'll never duel in a tournament again. *bummer*.  shark: i looked for five seconds, i... i was so scared of defeat. chills: hahahaha.  was the widdle bitty baby afraid to lose the big duel.  scorch: hm. chills: talk about *pathetic*.  scorch: hahaha.  chills: mommywoozing makes me *cwy*. waaaah. hahahahahayuma: *stop it*..  yuma: why're you jerks *laughing*. there's nothing funny about letting your *fear* get the best of you.  yuma: i should know 'cause i've *been there*. when i was dueling shark, <12:00> i thought it was all over.  yuma : so i busted out a number card even though i said i wouldn't.  yuma: i told myself i *had to*, for shark. but i realize that's not really why i did it. i just couldn't stand to lose. tori: poor guy... yuma: i betrayed myself out of fear. i lost the duel, *and* i lost a piece of what makes me *me*. i never wanna make that mistake againand shark feels the same way. so even if our backs are to the wall, and all hope seems lost, we're gonna fight from the heart *fair and square*.  yuma: that's the difference between us, and *you*. chills: ha. what a sweet little speech. scorch: *speaking* of 'backs to the wall' scorch: all you've got on *your* field is a *monster on ice*. you're *done*. yuma: huh.... shark: yuma. yuma: huh. shark: let's take these clowns out.  yuma: yeah. shark: it's *my turn*. i draw. first i'm activating a spell card, "xyz gift". when there's at least two xyz monsters on the field, i can use xyz gift to draw *two more cards*. <13:00> next i summon needle sunfish.  shark: now i activate the "surface" spell card from my hand. this allows me to summon one water monster from my graveyard. so watch out, 'cause big jaws is comin' back for more.  yuma: do it, shark.. shark: and now i overlay levelthree needle sunfish and big jaws. with these two monsters i build the overlay network and xyzsummon black ray lancer.  yuma: what's up, big guy. shark: next i activate black ray lancer's special ability. by using one overlay unit, i can stop volcasaurus from using its special abilities. scorch: you *what*.. yuma: now it can destroy that number card. scorch: except that volcasaurus has more attack points. shark: oh yeah, *about* that. i activate needle sunfish's special ability. since this guy was sent to the graveyard, <14:00> volcasaurus loses five hundred attack points.  yuma: aww, *yeah*.. now black ray lancer is stronger. astral: shark really turned this situation around. shark: what're you waiting for, black ray lancer. attack volcasaurus. go, shimmering spear slash. chills: huh. i activate "compensation exchange". this trap card stops black ray lancer's attack, but now, my lifepoints get hit with all of *volcasaurus's* attack points. yuma: thanks a lot. you just *had to get in the way*. scorch: he takes the hits an' i dish 'em out. chills: that's how the leaders a' the pack roll. scorch: and now i activate, "volcanic abyss". with this card, i can check out one of your hands, and if there's a monster card it gets sent back to your deck. let's see you holdin' any monster cards, pipsqueak. yuma : he's talkin' to *me*, isn't he. astral: yes, he is. and he is trying to stop you from summoning a monster on your next turn.  yuma: awww, are you *serious*.. mmmph.  shark : gogogo golem and monster reborn. <15:00> scorch : *monster reborn*. there's no *way* that pipsqueak knows how to use *that*.  you got a monster. now you have to send it back to your deck. yuma: sorry, gogogo golem... scorch: heheheheh...  shark: i place one card facedown and end my turn. scorch: and now *i'll* end *you*. my move. i draw. get ready to feel the heat, shark. 'cause i'm activating volcasaurus' special ability. megamax. first, volcasaurus destroys black ray lancer. then *you* take damage equal to black ray lancer's attack points.  scorch: hahahaha. *nighty night*, shark.  yuma: look out.. scorch: you're *finished*.  act 3 <15:46> scorch: volcasaurus, take out shark's black ray lancer.  scorch: and now, shark*say goodbye*.  yuma: not so fast. shark: huh. <16:00> yuma: i activate "damage diet". this trap cuts shark's damage in half this turn.  shark: ugh... and now, i activate "icy crevasse".  shark: so now i can destroy one of your monsters, and then strike *you* with damage equal to your monster's attack points.  chills: so you're tryin' to take out my partner and his monster, *are ya*. well, by activating "forced change", i can make freezerdon and *me* take the fall instead.  chills: aaaaaaahhhh.  yuma: all right. one down, one to go.  scorch: why, you little *pipsqueak*.. nobody messes with the chills.. i use volcasaurus's ability to destroy utopia.  yuma: oh, man yuma: uuuugghhh... damage diet, activate.  scorch: i'll finish you in a *sec*. but now, volcasaurus, attack shark directly.. shark: i play the "final offering" trap card.  shark: with this trap card's power, i can force a battle to stop by pulling one card from *my* hand and giving it to another playerlike *yuma*.  yuma: wha. you mean you'reare you sure you can trust me with it. shark: yup.  astral: that card is.... scorch: lucky break for *you*. butnow i activate the "twin volcano" spell. this card explodes for five hundred points of damage during each of my turns. *and* it erupts with five hundred points of damage, when i send it to the graveyard.  yuma: ah. oh wait, that means.... astral: as soon as it becomes his turn again, he will be able to defeat the both of you. yuma: oh.  chills: you little runts are *donefor*. scorch: hahahahahahahaha. not that you ever had a *chance*. <18:00> shark: that's where you're wrong. *you* guys're the ones who're *donefor*. yuma: ...hope you're right. i draw.  yuma: okay, now, um...  yuma: if, uh...  shark : the answer's right in front of you. astral : focus. you *have to play this right*, yuma.  yuma : okay... if i use monster reborn on utopia, thenoh, wait. *armored xyz*.  yuma : this was *shark's card*. that's it..  fb astral: what you failed to recognize is that monster reborn can also bring back a monster from *another* player's graveyard.  yuma: i play the spell card, "monster reborn". bronk: is he *really* gonna bring back utopia.. yuma: no, bronki'm reviving black ray lancer from shark's graveyard.  scorch: hahahahahaha. you could've brought out a gamechanger like utopia, but instead, you just brought out a game*ender*. act 4 <19:00> scorch: you couldve brought out a gamechanger like utopia, but instead, you just brought out a game*ender*. shark: i dont *think so*. scorch: you dont. yuma: from my hand, i activate the spell card, "armored xyz".  scorch: that doesnt sound too good. shark: all of a sudden, you two losers arent lookin so confident. yuma: the power of this card allows me to equip one monster on my field, with one xyz monster in my graveyard. utopia, rise. and now i equip black ray lancer with utopia.  scorch: thats nice that you made your *lancer* stronger, but did you forget that only a number can destroy a number. shark: we got *that* covered. scorch and chills: what.. shark: as far as technicalities are concerned, black ray lancer now has *utopias* powers. <20:00> yuma: so basically, black ray lancer *is* a number now. scorch: do you realize what this means.. chills: volcasaurus is going extinct.. yuma: black ray lancer, attack volcasaurus.  shark: your partners outta the picture, and you've got no monsters to hide behind. yuma: i think its safe to say that youre about to get officially *yumad*. cause by sending utopia to the graveyard...  yuma: black ray lancer can charge in again and attack you directly. scorch: whaa.. no way.  yuma: go, shimmering spear slaaaash...  tori: whoo, they won. bronk: hahah, you did it, yuma, haha.  astral : observation number twelve...  astral : not every duelist in this world duels with honor. <21:00> some are willing to compromise their spirits, as long as it means winning.    scorch: what *happened* to us, chills. chills: i *dunno*. i dont remember *nothin*...  scorch and chills: huh. chills: llook... its *shark*. scorch: run away.  bronk: thats what i *thought*. tori: *dont you mess with us again*..  yuma: ...hey, bronk.  ugghh, *im sorry i used a number card against shark when i said i
