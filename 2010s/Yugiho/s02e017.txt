  act 1 <<2:44  nistro: *slam 'em*, hammer bounzer. take that duelist down..  nistro: *get up*. i'm not finished with you yet.  i'll never cheat in a duel again, nistro. i learned my lesson. please. lemme go. nistro: not 'till you *pay*, punk, in full. dextra: that's enough, nistro, back off. nistro: huh. dextra: don't forget about our real mission, which is to track down number cards.  nistro: you're getting off easy *this* timebut don't let me see your face in heart land city.  nistro: pathetic slime.  flip: wah.. ohh... ugghh... hey, the tournament.  flip : oh, man.  flip : the last thing i remember was checking out the opening ceremonies at the duel carnival with yuma and the gang. fb flip: see ya in the finals. heheheheheheh.  gertrude, will you flip : i wanted to find a spot where i could *hide*...  flip : then i could *spy* on the other duelists to get an edge in my matches.   flip: but instead a' dueling i've just been *dozing*. i'll need to bust a *move* if i wanna win all the heart pieces i'll need for the finals.  flip: then *again*, i'm starting *really late*. a lot a' the *weaker* duelists've probably dropped out.  flip: which means there's more chance of me *losing*. it's gonna be *much* harder to collect pieces *now*. i'll *never* win this thing...  flip: *unless* i can pull a flipflop.  act 1 <<2:44  yuma: ah. oh yeah, haha. i have *four* heart pieces so far. tori: win one more and you'll advance to the finals. yuma: astral, look.  tori: what's wrong. yuma: astral isn't around. tori: but isn't he *always* nearby. yuma: oh well. it might be a nice change to have a duel without his commentary track.  astral: these numbers are fragments of my memories, and with the help of yuma, i have been fortunate to regain many of them.  astral: yet i still am uncertain of so much.  spencer: where is that snake. he's gotta be hiding *someplace*. yuma: spencer. what're you up to. spencer: huh. i'm lookin' for someone. have you guys seen flip. yuma: nope. spencer : he *ripped me off*.  fb flip: hehehehehey, spencer. i know you're gonna *rule* this duel carnival. fb spencer: yeah, those other duelists better *watch out*. fb flip: betcha collected *loads* a' those shiny *heart pieces* already, huh.  fb spencer: twobut i can't fit them together yet. fb flip: heheheheh.  fb flip: step this way. fb spencer: huh. whaddayou want.  fb flip: feast your eyes. fb spencer: you *won* all of those. fb flip: lemme see *your* piece.  fb spencer: hey wait. hey that's mine. give it back, flip.  fb flip: heheheheheh.  fb flip: a perfect fit. how would you like to make a deal, spencer my friend. fb spencer: uh... fb flip: i get to keep *your* piece, and in exchange you can have all the pieces you want from this bag. fb spencer: huh..  yuma and tori: huh.. yuma: you switched pieces with flip.. spencer: uhhuh.  spencer: it would've taken forever to collect all the heart pieces i needed if i had to *duel* for 'em all. but later i found out that the pieces i got from him were all phony.  spencer: they're made of *candy*. yuma and tori: candy.. spencer: i thought it was weird that the pieces were so *sticky*...  they melted in my pocket. tori: serves you right for trying to cheat your way into the finals. spencer: i *did* deserve it. but will you *please* help me get my pieces back from flip. yuma: ugh... sure, spencer.  disgusting.  he tricked me.  they're *fake*..  wait 'til i get my hands on that *flip*.  nistro: stop. huh.  nistro: *what happened*.  flip: hahahahaha, this *candy piece* scam is workin' out *sweet* for me. i already collected four heart pieces that fit and i only need one more to make the finals. hmhm.  flip: i *guess* using *one* piece of candy to complete my heart piece couldn't hurt. i'm *sure* no one will find out. heheheheh.  yuma: we better find flip before he scams *more* kids. tori: yeah, if he gets enough real pieces yuma and tori: he'll get into the finals..  flip: i got my pieces, all five of them. look. nistro: *bingo*.  flip: my heart piece is complete. nistro: my. that's impressive. it didn't take you very long.  flip: am *i* the first duelist to make the finals then. amazing..  flip: hahaha. i'm number one. whoohooo. yaaahaa. nistro: *unless* that's made out of candy..  flip: wahahahahahawhat.  i don't understand. are you suggesting that this heart piece could be a fake. i would *never* pull a trick like that, sir. nistro: *prove* it isn't candy by *tasting* it, then. flip: uhh, okay. i'll show you it's real.  flip: this tastes good.  flip: andit'smelting.. no.. it'scandy.. nistro: knock it off, kid. *i caughtcha*..  flip: ohh. i'm innocent.  act 2 <<6:53 flip: ohhhhhh... nistro: now, *what do we have here*. flip: i've been framed. i swear, sir. someone *planted* those pieces in my hat.  nistro: settle *down*. yuma: flip. flip: yuma. help. yuma: hold on. what're you planning to do with flip..  nistro: *what's it to you*.  dextra: hey. nistro.  dextra : i recognize him. that pest has gotten in our way before.  nistro: oh, yeah. yuma: *i wanna know what you two're gonna do with flip.* nistro: this *cheat* made fake heart pieces. he's gonna pay with his *deck*. *and* he'll be banned from competing in this and all future duel carnivals. plus i'm kicking 'im out of heart land city, and he can *never duel here again*..  yuma: flip was wrong, but isn't this a little extreme. nistro: i'll tell you what's extremehe violated our sacred rules of conduct.. now he'll suffer the consequences.. yuma: rrrgghhh....  flip : nooohohoho. i'm sorry, honest. i'll never break rules again. yuma: hey. wait a minute.  yuma: i can't deny that flip made a *huge mistake* and deserves to be punished, but you can't just ban him forever. how about we settle this honorably, with a duel. if i beat you, then you'll agree, to give him a second chance.  nistro: you, duel me. get real. i'm *way* better than you. yuma: that's what *you* think. i could beat you *and her*, together. dextra: *fine*, then. yuma: huh. dextra: a twoonone duel. you'll duel nistro and me together, and if you beat either one of us, then you win the match. and your friend gets his second chance. but if you *lose*, then you get the exact same punishment as him. yuma: ugh.... tori: don't do it, yuma. nistro: well, kid. ya still wanna duel..  nistro: i knew you'd back down once the stakes were high enough. you're all *talk*. yuma: stop right there.. i'll duel. both of you. nistro: *what.* flip: you *will*. dextra: hmph. tori: you could lose your *deck*, and be banned from competing in this or future duel carnivals. besides, astral isn't even around. how can you even *think* of taking those two on by yourself.. it's too tough. yuma: look, flip needs my help. i can't just *turn my back on 'im*. nistro: let's start. you have *no chance*, but this could be amusing. yuma: it *will be*, especially after i beat *both of you*..  yuma: get set to get decked. duel disk, go. duel gazer, let's roll.  nistro: get readyto *feel the heat*..  dextra: let's get down to business.  nistro: heheheheheheheheh.  computer: authentic reality vision link established.  yuma, nistro, dextra: let's duel.. act 3 <<10:05  astral: let me see if the memories i *do* have trigger anything new.  fb voice: your name... is *astral*.  fb voice: and you are being entrusted with the future of our world.  astral: no use. i cannot piece together more memories.  astral : i *need answers*. it seems clear my purpose is connected with yuma in ways i still fully grasp. there is a bond between us so strong it can generate a great transformation.  astral : but it will also bring destruction.   astral: yumahe has begun a duel. i *must go*. dark mist astral: leaving so soon, astral.  astral: you again. ...number ninetysix.  astral: how is it you are here. did you break your seal again. dark mist astral: correct. we all decided it was *time to act*. astral: you *all*.   dextra: we should end this duel quickly, nistro. nistro: no problem. flip: astral isn't *here*.. well then *this* match is *over*. ca'monn, yuma can't beat those guys by *himself*. tori: you better start cheering for yuma, or you'll have to deal with *me*. flip: you can beat 'em both, yuma.. yuma: don't worry, flip. i have the perfect *cards*, and strategy. you'll see. it's my move. ha. first i'm playin' a monster facedown in defense mode. then i'll play *another* facedown, and end my turn. nistro: ha. for someone who *talks* big it *sure* looks like you don't have the cards to back it up. yuma: you wish. i'm just gettin' ready to pounce when the time is right. astral: does this mean that the other numbers are giving you their power.  dark mist astral: naturally. we all agree that our time has come. it is time to act, and to destroy..  astral: destroy. are you saying that we exist in order to bring *destruction* to the world.. dark mist astral: what *other* purpose could you and i have.  dextra: *i'll* go next. i draw.  dextra: and summon morpho butterspy.   dextra: and with this, i'll end my turn.  dextra: you're up, nistro. yuma: that's *one strong butterfly*. nistro: if you think *that's* strong, just wait until you see what *i* have in store for you. you ready. i *draw*.. i summon hammer bounzer.  nistro: i can summon this card when you have cards on your field but i don't.  nistro: my bounzer is a real *beast*. tori: look at all those attack points.... flip: he's not foolin' around. that monster's level *six*. nistro: i'll turn it over to *you*, yuma. let's see if you have the guts to strike.  yuma : i have to think this through carefully, before i decide which monster to go after first.  yuma : *and*, which of my cards to use.  that's it. i know my next move. i draw. aaandi'm gonna change my facedown monster from defense mode, to attack mode. rev it up, rai rider.  nistro: hmph. *twelve hundred attack points*. if that's your best monster, this duel will be over quick. yuma: don't be too sure. next i'm gonna summon tasuke knight.   yuma: first i'll knock out that morpho butterspy with tasuke knight, then rai rider can attack to score some major damage. okay, tasuke knight, attack with power push.. dextra: i activate the trap "butterflyoke".  dextra: and with it i'm putting the brakes on your tasuke knight's attack. because when butterflyoke is equipped onto your monster, it switches it from attack to defense mode. yuma: aah.  tori: she foiled his attack before it even *hit*. yuma: rrrgghh... nistro: it seems you're right back where you were before your turn *began*, genius. yuma: just wait until my next turn.  flip: yuma's a total *mess* without astral around to help 'im battle. where *is* he.. *send out an astral alarm*..  dark mist astral: your destiny lies with us. remember your mission.  dark mist astral: ahahahahaha. the time has come at last. come and join usastral..  dark mist astral: *what*..  astral: utopia. dark mist astral: number thirtynine, you refuse to join us on our mission of destruction. well theni will have to have you join us by force.  dark mist astral: subdue utopia, dark mist.  dextra: i summon swallowtail butterspy in attack mode.   dextra: then i'll use my butterflyoke trap card again and spring its second effect. once each turn this trap card lets me change the battle mode of the equipped monster. so i'm switching your tasuke knight to attack mode. yuma: it's obvious that you're planning to attack tasuke knight with your swallowtail. but there's hardly any difference in attack points, so i'll just take a *little* damage. dextra: you're right. so i'll have to activate morpho's special ability. if your monster changes battle mode, once a turn morpho wipes out a thousand of its attack points. yuma: oh man. tori: your knight's *totally vulnerable* now. dextra: morpho butterspy, take out tasuke knight with blue scale stream.  yuma: auugh, aaaahhh. dextra: and i'm also triggering *swallowtail's* special ability. now one of your monsters loses attack points equal to the amount of damage you just took.  flip: call a mechanic, 'cause that biker is *breakin' down*. dextra: get set, swallowtailattack rai rider. vivid scale stream.  act 4 <<16:54  tori: yuma. flip: we're gonna get *tossed* if he loses.  guess i better start packing my suitcase.. nistro: you're running out of lifepoints fast, yuma, and you still haven't scored a single hit against my partner and me. *give it up*. yuma: no way. i was just warming up, and the real duel is *just beginning now*. and i've got some surprises for ya. nistro: hmph, *really*. yuma: i'm gonna use rai rider's special ability. since your monster *attacked* this card, it can't battle on your next turn. nistro: hunh. what *difference* does it make. your field is empty anyway. that special ability is *useless* right now. dextra: he can't last much longer, nistro. *finish him*.  dark mist astral: *take hold* of utopia..  nistro: it's *my turn*..  huah.. i summon blade bounzer.  nistro: then hammer bounzer's gonna attack you directly. and don't think you can protect yourself either. when there are no spell or trap cards on my field and this card attacks, you can't activate *any* spells or traps. you're *totally* at my mercy now, yuma, and i'm not in a forgiving mood. attack him, hammer bounzer. knuckle knockdown. yuma: rrrrrghhh...  tori: yuma. flip: he's almost donefor. nistro: hah. that loser is out of his league. one last attack from blade bounzer, and this duel is over.  nistro: huh.. he should've taken more damage.  tori: yuma's monster protected him..  yuma: that's right, because when i'm attacked directly, i can summon gagaga gardna from my hand to help shield me. and by discarding one card, it won't be destroyed.  nistro: hmph. but you *still* take damage if my monster is *stronger*. your gardna has fifteen hundred attack points. my blade bounzer has eighteen hundred. blade bounzer, strike. use your straight slash. yuma: i'm discarding one card, and activating gagaga gardna's special ability again.  tori: yuma.. flip: he lost another three hundred lifepoints. yuma: yeah. but i can keep fighting on. and so can my gagaga gardna. nistro: *oh no it can't.* check out my blade bounzer's special ability.  nistro: by discarding a card from my hand, blade bounzer can clobber your monster all over again. yuma: not cool. flip: gardna is a goner. nistro has four more cards left after this, so he can keep on attacking. nistro: once again, blade bounzer, attack gagaga gardna. straight slash.. yuma: don't worry, gardna. i'm discarding a card, so that bounzer of his can't hurt you in any way.  tori: yuma. nistro: you just played your last card, kid. now gagaga gardna can't use its special ability again.  nistro: it was a total rout. you choked, and now you're out of the carnival.  nistro: strike again, bounzer. let's end this duel now.. straight slash attack.  yuma: gagaga gardna.. noooooooooo..  end <<20:47 * special thanks to animeratio.com for the copy of this episode transcribed online. * special thanks to yugioh wikia as a source for checking cards. *
