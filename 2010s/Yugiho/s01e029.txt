  act 1 <2:58>  yuma: shark. come on, wake up. <3:00> can you hear me. please, ya gotta snap out of it.  bronk: oh, *man*, this looks bad.  kite: are you *finished* yet. orbital: aalmost. the analysis is *still running*. ii just have to complete this photon stream probe.  orbital: iif this works, it could help us figure out if this pendant *really does* come from another world. aand, just maybe what its *real ppurpose* is. kite: find out everything you can.  kite: doctor faker is keeping something from me. but i'm going to uncover the truth.  orbital: iif doctor faker hears about this investigation, hehe'll go ballistic. kite: *so will i* if you don't get results.  orbital: yyou can count on me.   bronk: is shark gonna be okay. kazwell: the doctor says there's nothing wrong with him *physically*. cathy: why doesn't he wake up then. <4:00> yuma: because... shark's soul has been stolen.  tori: ah. bronk: please, this is no time for jokes. kazwell: i think he means it. don'tcha, yuma. yuma: unfortunately, yeah, kazwell.  yuma : when that number hunter kite wins a duel, he takes the loser's number *and* their soul.  yuma: he stole something *else* this time, too. my golden key.  yuma : and *astral was inside it* when kite took it and flew off.  yuma: i have to get it back. bronk: he *lives* in there. yuma: yeah. i can't explain how it works, but it's true. as long as that key is with me, astral is with me, too. kazwell: in the end, i'm afraid your key won't be easy to recover, especially if you don't know where kite has gone. cathy: *we'll* help you find it, yuma. bronk: sure, but, *how*. kazwell: if that key really is special, kite will want to examine it. he'll most likely wanna run some kind of *computer analysis*<5:00> ah.  kazwell: *yuma*. i think i've just figured out a way to track down your key. orbital: wewell, *i'll be rebooted*. kite: what is it. orbital: the pendant has its own gragravitational field, *iinside*. kite: its own field... is that *possible*. orbital: look. the field is generating an interdimensional link between *this* world...  orbital: *and*... somewhere else. kite: it must be astralworld. open that link now, orbital.  orbital: ookeydoke.  mr. kay: you want me to track down a *crook*. kazwell: we're counting on you, mister kay.  kazwell: all you have to do is upload a virus into the datanet, and find the computer he's using. mr. kay: i dunno... after all, i'm a *teacher*, not a detective. kazwell: there's no *way* we can fail, with your programming skills. mr. kay: but, even so... yuma: *but nothin'*, mister kay.  yuma: the only way to save shark and astral, is if you help us.  kazwell: may i have a word in private.  mr. kay: wha. kazwell : listen. <6:00> i *know* you wanna help. especially after all the trouble you caused with your crashbug virus.  mr. kay: ggh. crashbug..  kazwell : i bet you feel *pretty bad* about all the *chaos* you caused around the city.   mr. kay : *not so loud*, huh.  kazwell: but now's your chance to make up for it by helping us out.  mr. kay: ugh... all right. kazwell : he's going to help.. yuma: excellent.  bronk: you sure we should be hackin' into the datanet with a *virus*. sounds kinda risky. kazwell: relax, bronk. i promise this virus is totally harmless. it will simply track all datanet searches relating to yuma's key, and then, pinpoint where they came from.  kazwell: which should lead us directly to kite's computer, and to yuma's key.  crashbug x: crashbug. kazwell: all thanks to mister kay's expertise.  cathy: hey, am i wrong, or does mister kay's expertise look an awful lot like the crashbug virus. mr. kay: ahh...  bronk: you mean that virus that made the city grid go haywire.  kazwell: i'm sure mister kay had *nothing* to do with that. uh, *did* you. mr. kay : eheheheh. you kids and your wild imaginations...  <7:00> mr. kay: yes. the virus has been uploaded successfully. *fingers crossed*, everyone.  crashbug x: crashbug. crashbugabugabug. crashbug.  yuma: now, go find my key. act 2 <7:19>  orbital: carbonic laser... negative. hydrophonic beam, thumbs ddown, nothing is *working*, master kkite. i've tried every energy source on this plplanet, and there's *no response*. kite: then use a baria crystal.  orbital: really. kite: yes, you heard me.  kite : it comes from the barian world, not from this planet. its energy may activate the pendant.  orbital: grgreat idea, but baria crystals are *rare*. ii'm afraid *finding* one *won't be easy*. kite: use *your* crystal. orbital: whaaaat.. bbut that's *my* energy source. i, i can't function without it. kite: losing *one small shard* shouldn't be a problem. orbital: i *gguess* not... here goes nothing.  <8:00> orbital : except my *power supply*, that is...  orbital: thithis baria crystal lights up my life. i hate to give up *aany* of it. but i *suppose* losing a little bit won't *hurt*...  orbital: ... *much*.  orbital: ookay. now i'll move the baria crystal so its eenergy field converges with the pendant.  orbital: mamaster kite, iit's working. the pendant is reacting to the crystal's energy field.  orbital: i can't be sure, but it appears that the pendant's internal gravity is *warping*. the readings are quiquite unusual. sirllook.  kite: d'you realize what this *is*, orbital. yuma's pendant has opened up a portaland i *bet* it's a portal to astralworld.  orbital: master.  orbital: i wish he'd learn to *look* bbefore he *leaps*. <9:00>   kite: could this be *astralworld*....  kite: hm. what is *that*.  mr. kay: the virus is still searching for kite's computer. come on, *find* it...  crashbug x: bug.  crashbug x: crashbug. crashbugabugabugabug.  mr. kay: the virus has detected something.  mr. kay: we're in luck. the data stream leads to a warehouse that's owned by *mister heartland*. yuma: that's where my golden key is.  tori: yuma. kite: we meet at last.  kite: *you* must be the visitor from astralworld. astral: i should've *guessed* it was *you*, kite. kite: how d'you know my name. astral: we were opponents in a duel once. kite: oh, *really*.  <10:00> kite: that number card....  kite: it's hard for me to imagine why you'd wanna team up with a *twerp* like yuma tsukumo. astral: at least *he* is no thief. are you not the one who stole the golden key. kite: so *that's* what the pendant is called. astral: *you also* hunt numbers. why. kite: why do *you*. astral: because. numbers are fragments of my memories. kite: so... you need them to *remember*. astral: that is right. now please. tell me why *you* want numbers. i *demand* you answer me. kite: i wanna learn the numbers' *secrets*, *and* the secrets of astralworld and barianworld. astral: *barian*.... kite: the only way to make sure i get the answers i need, is to seize *all* the numbers. so i'm going to need you to hand over the numbers you've collected with yuma.  astral: if i did *that*, i would never regain my memories.  kite: then i'll have to get them another wayhow 'bout a duel.  yuma : i've gotta get to that warehouse, <11:00> before it's too late. kite: photon transformationgo.  kite: hope you're good at subtraction... heheheheh... 'cause you're about to lose your numbers. astral : if i lose this duel, i will lose *more* than just my numbers.  astral : but i *cannot avoid* this challenge.  astral: ready.. astral and kite: let's duel..  act 3 <11:38>  tori: yuma. why're your cards getting all... glowy. yuma: i think *astral's* using them. astral: since *you* challenged *me*, *i* will draw first. i play a monster facedown in defense mode. then i'll place another card facedown, <12:00> and end my turn.  by placing gogogo golem in defense mode, it can avoid being destroyed by an attack once per turn. and then, by placing my "battle break" trap card, i have further fortified my defenses. now, when kite attacks...  astral : this trap will activate, destroying his monster and ending the battle immediately.   astral : go aheadand make your move, kite. i am ready for you. kite: brace yourself... here i go.. i'll start by pinning your facedown card in place.  kite: lock it down, reverse buster. hyeah.   kite: when reverse buster attacks, you can't activate your spell or trap cards.  kite: now, reverse buster, take out his facedown monster.   <13:00> kite: your *gogogo golem* is a goner. 'cause i'm activating reverse buster's special ability. astral: what. kite: when reverse buster attacks a facedown monster in defense mode, your monster is *automatically destroyed*. astral: ugh... kite: and *since* reverse buster's special ability destroyed your monster, you might wanna say your last goodbyes, because your *gogogo golem* can't be saved.  kite: and it gets better, because when reverse buster destroys a monster *that* way, *it gets stronger*.  astral : two thousand attack points.  astral : if kite uses another monster...  astral : with at least two thousand astral : attack points...  astral : he can tribute them to summon galaxyeyes photon dragon.   astral : is that his strategy. or does he have another plan for his monster. kite is a clever duelist. i must be careful, or i will lose *everything*. kite: i end my turn, with a facedown. <14:00> astral: i must commend you. it seems your dueling skills are even more masterful than i remember, kite. kite: how *flattering*. but if you're trying to trick me into lowering my guard, forget it.  astral: i meant what i said. it is clear that you are the best duelist i have *ever* met. yet i cannot shake this feeling that you are not doing this for yourself. *why is that*, kite.  kite: waitis this a duel, or are we playing *twenty questions* now. i understand why you're trying to stall as long as possible, thoughsince you're losing. astral: i sense you are hiding something. something that *troubles you deeply*.  kite: enough talking. let's get this duel over with. astral: of course. i do wish we were not meeting as opponents, however. i find you fascinating. i think you are very much like yuma. kite: like *yuma*.. astral: although i was unable to become one with him, my time with yuma has helped me understand and appreciate his spirit.  astral : he misses his parents very much. this longing in yuma's heart drives him to follow their example. <15:00>  astral : that is why he is always trying to 'highfive the sky'. yuma never gives up. kite: and you... think that i'm like him. astral: correct. kite: you're wrong. *just one* person matters to me. i only care about *hart*.. astral: who is hart. kite: never mind. let's get back to what's importantdueling.  kite: get on with your turn. astral: all right. i draw. i now play gogogo giant.  astral: this monster can bring back gogogo golem from my graveyard in defense mode.  astral: and since it used its special ability, gogogo giant now has to switch to defense mode as well.  kite : two level*four* monsters on the field. interesting. he must be getting ready to summon a number. <16:00> astral : without knowing the identity of kite's facedown card, i am not sure if i should risk summoning my number, or strengthen my defenses.  astral: since i now have two monsters in defense mode, i can activate the spell "double defender". now, once per turn, i can negate an attack from *your* monster. kite: heh. astral: finally, i will end my turn by placing one card facedown. kite: hmhmhm. i must admit, i'm *surprised*. i thought you'd summon utopia.  kite: but then you'd be taking a *big risk*, wouldn't you, because you'd lose the two monsters that are defending you. and doing *that* would leave you *quite vulnerable*. those two facedown cards you played. they're there to *protect* you, aren't they.  kite: you seem very *worried* about something. are you scared that i'll summon galaxyeyes photon dragon.   kite: you *are* scared.  as you *should be*.. i now play the spell card, "photon hurricane".  kite: brace yourself. <17:00> because all the trap and spell cards on your field, are about to be *blown away*. hope you weren't counting on those facedown cards to save you.  astral: this cannot be. kite: yes, the facedown card that made you *panic* so much... astral: ...was nothing i should have feared....  kite: if only you'd had the guts to be more aggressive on your last turn. i would've been in *real* trouble. you're going to pay a price for being so cautious. now i'm tributing reverse buster, in order to summon photon leo.   kite: i activate its special ability. howling blow..  act 4 <17:45>  kite: the end is near. because my photon leo's ability blows *all the cards in your hand* *back into your deck*, and forces you to draw the same number of cards again. <18:00>  astral: ah. kite: why don't you stop your stalling and get drawing.  kite: i'm afraid you'll have to *totally* rethink your strategy *now*. hmhmhm. *or* you can just give up. it's *clear* you don't have what it takes to win this duel. *you're too scared* of losing.   yuma: move it, you guys.  yuma : hello. open up. c'mon.  yuma: i know you're in there, kite. tori: yumalook at your deck.  yuma: astral's still dueling. i have to get in and help him. tori: what're you so worried about. yuma: i'm worried 'cause he's dueling against kiteand he can't win alone. bronk: so who's this dude *kite* again. kazwell: he's a number hunter, bronk. yuma: gotta hurry.  yuma: hey.. hey, kite.. lemme in.. <19:00>  kite: now i'll make photon leo even stronger with the equip spellphoton... spear.  kite: now when photon leo attacks your monster in defense mode, if my monster is stronger than yours, the point difference is dealt to you as damage. photon leo, stick it to gogogo giant.. silver spear strike.  astral : kite was correct. i have been so anxious about losing this duel, that i focused *all* my attention on *not* losing. i never gave serious thought to how to *win*.   yuma: ugh. come on, *open*. uuuuggghhhh. it won't budge.  tori: give us a hand, you guys. <20:00>  yuma: all together.  yuma: wow. i guess we're stronger than i thought.  mr. kay : i uploaded a new virus to crash the warehouse security system. you should be all clear now. yuma: thanks, mister kay. you rock. now, let's move in.  orbital: hello. master kkite. can ya hear me.  orbital: i hope he's okkay. 'cause ththere's no *way* i'm leaping into that thithing to *rescue* him... crashbug x: crashbug.  crashbug x: crash. crashbug x: bug. crashbug x: crashbug. crashbug x: crashbugabugabugabug.. crashbug x: crashbug. orbital: what's ththis. uhoh, we're being *hacked*. better update my antivirus software.  orbital: ohh..  orbital: iit's too late. the whole system is cracrashing.. mmaster kite will *not be pleased*....  pa: security breach in sector three. <21:00> security breach in sector three.  orbital: it's *yuma*. how'd *they* get in here. ohhh... i'm gonna need a lotta *new parts* after kite hears around *this*.... kite: you *know* you're going to lose. why don't you accept the inevitable. call it quits, and give me all your numbers. astral: no. i will *not* quit. while you were sounding off, i remembered...  astral : ...some very wise advice i once heard from a friend of mine.  kite: mm. astral: prepare yourself, number hunterbecause *i am feeling the flow*.  end <21:32> * special thanks to animeratio.com for the copy of this episode transcribed online. * special thanks to yugioh wikia as a source for checking cards. * special thanks to kazuki takahashi, 4kids, et al. for yugioh. zexal. last updated: may 23, 2013 i don't own yugioh zexal, at all, and this transcript is unofficial and without any permission whatsoever. please link back to me if you use my work. for more information about my transcript format, please click here. read my commentary on this episode here )
