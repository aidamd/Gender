  act 1 <<2:42  yuma: whoa. that's no *monster*, it's a *megamonster*.  quinton: my dyson sphere is more magnificent than all your monsters *combined*. *and*, it's practically *invincible*. your pitiful attacks can't damage it, kite. kite: that *can't* be. there must be a way to destroy it.  quinton: you're *wrong*. as long as it has its overlay units, dyson sphere will be shielded from *any* attack. kite: so *that's* why my attack wasn't successful before... but now i know its weakness. quinton : *if you say so*, kite.  quinton: i know every move you'll make before *you* even do. you can't surprise *me*. after alli taught you everything you know.  yuma: he was kite's dueling instructor.. quinton: it's true. vetrixi mean, my fathervanished, and my family was torn apart.  fb young trey: don't let them take us.. quinton : my kid brothers were taken away from me... it was hard to watch them go...  quinton : ... but i stayed behind with doctor faker, to try and solve the mystery of my father's disappearance.  quinton : that's when i met doctor faker's sons quinton: : kite, and hart. i suppose when i saw them, they reminded me of my *own* brothers.  quinton : i liked them right away, and my brotherly instincts started taking over.  quinton : that's why i began teaching kite how to duel. more than anything, he wanted to protect his younger brother. but he knew, he would have to become *much stronger*.  quinton : we had many practice duels as i tried to teach him everything i could.  quinton: but we're no longer master and pupil, and this duel is for real. i won't let you stand in my way, kite. your dueling days will *soon be over*.  act 2 <<4:36  kite: i'm ending my turn. throw your worst at me, quinton. quinton: with pleasure, i draw. you're *so predictable*. it's almost as if i can read your mind. you've noticed that dyson sphere has twentyeight hundred attack points, but your galaxyeyes has three thousand. so you feel confident that i can't attack.  quinton: but there's *one* factor you *didn't* count on. dyson sphere has *another* ability. and i'm going to activate it *right now*.. by using one overlay unit, my dyson sphere can attack you directly.   kite: no way.. astral: this move will leave quinton with a serious advantage. yuma: kite won't have many lifepoints left..  orbital: ssystems are cccrashing.. quinton: go, brilliant bombardment.  kite: i activate a trap"lumenize".  kite: this card not only stops your attack, but my galaxyeyes gets a powerup equal to dyson sphere's attack points.  astral: it appears that *kite* now has the advantage over *quinton*. quinton: impressive... but totally *expected*.  quinton: i activate my *own* trap"space gate". space gate destroys your trap, so say goodbye to lumenize. that means your galaxyeyes doesn't power up, and dyson sphere still gets to attack you directly.  quinton: this one's for my family. doctor faker's treachery *tore us apart*.. defeating you will be *just the start* of our revenge.   orbital: master kkkite... yuma: i can't believe ithe's makin' kite look like an amateur.   astral: it is quite remarkable. i can detect *no weakness* in quinton's play.  quinton: what's the point in continuing. it's *hopeless*. you only have *two hundred lifepoints left*, kite.  quinton: why not admit the truththat you will *never* outduel me.  yuma: come on, kite. you can't quit now.  yuma: think about your little brother. what will happen to *hart* if you lose.. kite: my brother....   yuma: stand up. kite: be quiet. let me do the dueling and *butt out*.  yuma: ugh...  orbital: *yeah*. stop with the annoying ccomments, ya got that.. tori: back off, bot. you can be just as annoying as *yuma*. orbital: ohh...  yuma: thanks a lot. quinton: don't be naive, yuma. you should be on *my* side, not on kite's. yuma and tori: huh. quinton: kite's the eldest son of doctor faker. the man who betrayed your father. he's also a number hunter, so you can be *sure* he'll come after your cards, if he hasn't already. can't you see that he's our mutual enemy. it's *obvious*.  yuma: *no*. kite and i dueled. and that means we'll always be friends.  yuma: sure, he doesn't *realize* he's my friend yet, but he will someday. and because he is a friend, i'll always be on his side. quinton: very touching, yuma. your father spoke about friendship that way, too. of course... that was before faker doublecrossed him and my father. they *trusted* him, yuma. and they *both* paid the price.. yuma: ugh... quinton: maybe *you* can forget that and be friends with faker's son, but i *can't*.  quinton : not since i learned the truth, and made up my mind to leave.  fb kite: hey. wait up.  fb kite: what's wrong, why're you leaving.  fb kite: *talk* to me.  fb kite: quinton...  kite: the past doesn't matter. all i care about is winning this duel and taking your number. quinton: you *won't*. my rage makes me want this win more than you do. kite: enough talk.. let's get back to duelingi draw..  kite: this is it. time to beat the unbeatable. i play the spell card, "overlay break". this card not only gets rid of dyson sphere's overlay units, but now a monster can destroy it in battle *even if it's not a number*. astral: impressive move.  kite: and now i can blast dyson sphere into space debris. destroy it, galaxyeyes photon dragon. photon stream of destruction.. quinton: yet another move i *totally expected*. i activate *another* one of dyson sphere's special abilities. kite: say *what*.... quinton: if dyson sphere has no overlay units when it's attacked, then it can *retrieve* the units it needs from the graveyard. now that it has its overlay units back, i activate dyson sphere's *first* abilitywhich means that your dragon's paltry attack will be repelled.  quinton: i *did* warn you. *nobody* can destroy dyson sphere. your defeat is *unavoidable*. yuma: quinton's got kite's back against the wall. one more attack and it's over.  act 3 <<10:07  kite : that number seems indestructible. i gotta *think*.  i place one card facedown... *your* turn. quinton: it's time. i draw. yuma: whoa. here it comes. astral: a direct attack. quinton: now i'll activate, the spell "gravity blaster". kite: a spell....  quinton: this equip spell raises dyson sphere's attack points by four hundred. and it gets worse, much worse. when dyson sphere battles your monster, my spell negates your monster's special abilities. yuma: why doesn't quinton attack him directly. astral: that would end the duel right now. quinton: you understand what i'm doing, don't you, kite. defeating you *isn't enough*. i want the satisfaction of destroying the card you treasure mostgalaxyeyes.  quinton: take aim, dyson sphere. attack.  kite: i activate a trap"mirror shade". by giving up half my lifepoints, i don't take any damage from your attack.  orbital: flaming floppies..  quinton: you may not realize it... but i'm really doing you a favor, kite. you've been forced to carry many burdens these past years. now you'll be free from them *all*. i envy you. you won't have to hunt numbers anymore. or take care of your little brother hart.  kite: no. you're wrong about hart. uugghhh... i never thought of 'im as a burden, and i never will. my brother hart means *everything* to mehe's the reason i keep fighting on.  kite: hart needs me, and i need him. so i'm *never* gonna give up. now let's go.  quinton: if you want to extend this *farce*, be my guest. kite: my turn. i draw..  i can't believe it. out of all the cards in my deck...  kite : i drew the one that gives me a chance. hart, there's still hope.  kite: i was *meant* to draw this card. i activate the spell card "message in a bottle". quinton: what..  quinton: how did *kite* ever get his hands on *that* card. kite: heheh. even though you trained me, there are some things you don't know about my dueling *or* my deck. i never told you about this card. ya see, it's very special. it's the only card my father ever gave me.  yuma: it came from his father.... doctor faker. kite: i never used this card 'til now... so you couldn't know about it. quinton: how could you include your father's card in your deck.. you know all the terrible things he's done. yuma: you shouldn't judge kite. he's only been trying to help his brother. the same way *you've* been trying to help your *own* family. you've *both* done things i don't like, but i respect *one thing*kite has hope for his family, the same as you do. quinton: hope for his family.... yuma: don'tcha see that kitekite: *enough*.  kite: this feud is none of your business. so *stay out of it*, yuma. now with the power of message in a bottle, i can summon *three* monsters from my graveyard, as long as they each have a different level. first i'm gonna bring back galaxyeyes photon dragon. welcome *back*, galaxyeyes. and next i'm bringing back photon thrasher, and photon pirate. and when i summon monsters using this spell, they have *zero* attack points.     quinton: so that's your big play.. i'm not impressed. they're powerless if you can't overlay them because they're different levels. kite: i haven't finished yet. quinton: there's more. kite: yeah, i'm activating another spell card. it's "upshift". this card raises the levels of my monsters on my field, so that they all equal the *highest* level monster. so now all my monsters increase their level *to eight*.  quinton: oh no.. kite: oh yes. and now i'll overlay my galaxyeyes photon dragon, photon thrasher, and photon pirate in order to xyz summon.  kite: your fate is sealed. there's no escapefrom neo galaxyeyes photon dragon.    kite: as you know, since my xyz summon succeeded, this space field's effect activates, allowing me to draw one card.  kite: *perfect*. neo galaxyeyes' special ability activatesphoton howling.  kite: once i xyz summon neo galaxyeyes, all other monsters *immediately* lose their special abilities. that's *bad news* for your dyson sphere.  quinton: it's losing power.  kite: i'm also activating the spell card "big bang panic". it transforms your spell card into an overlay unit.  kite: oh, by the way... did i mention that my monster gets eight hundred attack points for each overlay unit.  kite: now neo galaxyeyes uses one of *its* overlay units to activate its special ability.. which lets it absorb all of *dyson sphere's* overlay units.  kite: and that seals it, because neo galaxyeyes gains five hundred attack points for each absorbed unit. quinton: i can't believe it gained so much power. kite: that's right. more than you know. my dragon can now attack once for each overlay unit it absorbed.  kite: go, neo galaxyeyes photon dragon. attack with ultimate photon stream of destruction..  act 4 <<16:43  kite: go, neo galaxyeyes photon dragon. attack with ultimate photon stream of destruction..  quinton: aaahhh.   fb dr. faker: this is for you, kite.  fb young kite: ahhh.... thank you, father.    quinton: i can see now that there are things more powerful than revenge. deep down... i always knew that was true... but today you helped me *remember* it, kite. kite: quinton... i mean, christopher arklight. quinton: it's been a long time since anybody called me by that name. yuma: i don't understand why you ever changed it. quinton: like our father... we decided to give up our true names.  at first, i was hoping that i could *save* my father. but byron arklight *really had* become someone else. vetrix was obsessed with his desire to get revenge against doctor faker.  quinton: i got caught up in his plans for vengeance... i felt... it was my duty as his son. kite: it *isn't*.  kite: once i save hart, i'm going to confront *my* father. and not only that, i'll do what you couldn't do. i'll stop vetrix's quest for revenge just like you wanted. quinton: ... you've grown strong, kite. i am proud to have been your teacher. it was an honor.  quinton : the bond we forged can never be broken.  quinton: you and hart will always be like little brothers to me. goodbye, kite.  kite : goodbye, chris.  yuma: hey, kite. kite: yes, yuma. yuma: i'll look for ya in the next round. we're both definitely gonna make it there.  kite: let's go. *right now*, orbital. orbital: riright, er, mind if i drop by a mechanic on the way home. i'm way past dududue for my annual checkup.  orbital: ... guess i should interpret that surly glaglare as a *no*... heheh.  orbital: i'll have to maintain *myself*, then. let's just hope the robo unit doesn't catch wind of thithis. okayall systems gggo.   quinton: i'm so *tired*... i need rest.  yuma: vetrix and doctor faker both have to be stopped. astral: perhaps that is my true purpose here. we know that your father is in astralworld. what if... he sent *me* here in order to *intervene* somehow. yuma: yeah, that's it. dad wanted us to team up to stop doctor faker and vetrix. astral : mm. tori: you think you can do it. yuma: yeah. i promisewe'll stand up to them, and end their mischief for good. my father is counting on us. end <<20:44 * special thanks to animeratio.com for the copy of this episode transcribed online. * special thanks to yugioh wikia as a source for checking cards. *
