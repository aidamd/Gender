 act 1 <<2:30  trey: i knew you would never survive without astral.  yuma: don't... count me out... yet.  yuma: i'm still in thisand i've got *lots* of fight left. that was just the warmup. the real duel's starting *now*.  trey: you're down to two hundred  points. one more attack and it's all over.  trey: it's your turn, but you may as well *give up*. yuma: quitting isn't my style.  yuma: i still have a chance to pull this off 'cause astral's memory is always with me..  you have my promise, astral. i may be down, but i've still got plenty of fight left.  yuma : i'm gonna unleash the power of the card you left for me to pull off a *win*.  yuma: come on, utopia. it's time to feel the flow..  yuma: when my lifepoints are less than a thousand, i can use utopia to xyz summon, chaos number thirtynine, utopia ray.. go, chaos xyz evolution.   bronk: lookin' *good*, utopia ray. cathy: that's it, yuma. great move. trey : at last he's summoned it. yuma : this better work. if utopia ray can't bring trey back to his senses, then *nothing* will.  i activate overlay eater's special ability from my graveyard. by banishing this card, my utopia ray takes an overlay unit from your xyz monster.  yuma: perfect. atlandis can't use its special ability anymore. trey: rrgghh. yuma: and *now*, utopia ray will use *its* special ability. utopia ray gains five hundred attack points from every overlay unit that it uses. and i'm gonna use *all three* of its overlay units to supercharge its power.  yuma: overlay charge.. its ability also cuts atlandis's points down by three thousand.  trey: how can you duel this way with *astral* gone. yuma: because astral never *left*.  yuma: because he's always with mehere in my heart. you tried to take astral away from me, but you've *failed*.  yuma : and now we're gonna win this duel *together*. just watch.  yuma: okay, utopia ray. time to *strike*. trey: sorry, but utopia ray just *struck out*. i activate my "thunder pot" trap card.  trey: not only does it stop utopia ray's attack against my atlandis, but it also *ends this battle*. yuma: that wasn't exactly what i had in mind... cathy: oh, i thought yuma *had* 'im. bronk: that trey sure is *tricky*. trey: you *gave it your best try*. but even *utopia ray* can't stop me. yuma: rrggh, doesn't matter. i managed to hang on *this* longand i will find a way to win this thing. so *take your turn*.  trey: you *do know* how to talk a good game, yuma. but the fact is, both our monsters' attack points return to normal now, so you can't possibly survive another blow. now, i draw.  trey : ohh. not *now*. vetrix *warned* me this might happen.  fb trey: aauugghhh...ughh.... fb vetrix: you *must understand*. by acquiring the crest you *will* gain the incredible power to utilize and control number six, chronomaly atlandis.  however, there *is a price to be paid* for this power. the crest can be dangerous. it will drain away all of your physical and mental energy. fb trey: uugghhh, i don't care about that. ugh...  fb trey: i... just wanna beat yuma... ugh... and make you proud of me. fb vetrix: i'm *confident* you won't let me down.  fb vetrix: you're stronger than you know, trey.   trey : this weakness is the price i have to pay. ugh... vetrix believes in me and i'm not gonna let him down now.  i *will not fail*. you're finished, yuma. hah.  act 2 <<7:03  trey: rrgh... since atlandis has no overlay units left, you lose half your lifepoints, yuma.  trey: and so do iaaaaahhh.   tori: nooo.   bronk: unbelievable. he gave up lifepoints just to get yuma. flip: please, get up.  yuma: i still have a hundred lifepoints, trey... that's enough to keep dueling.  trey: ugh. yuma: the crest. it's taken over.  trey: ugh. uuuuuaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh... yuma: that crest's gonna destroy him. trey.  trey: uuugghhhno. stay back.  trey: i don't want your help, yuma. i *chose* to take this path, understand. it's the only way i can get the power that i need. what happens to me, it doesn't matter at all. as long asi can serve my family.. yuma: but, trey... trey: this last attack'll wipe out your lifepoints. erupt, chronomaly atlandis.. destroy utopia ray, with celestial strike.   kazwell: oh, no.  kazwell : if yuma takes this hit, this duel's over. yuma: i activate my "battle break" trap card.  yuma: when your monster attacks, your monster is destroyed and the battle is over.  trey: huh.  trey: i'll use  fb vetrix: the ritual was a success, trey. now, as promisedhere's the number. along with a most *sinister* card.  fb trey: "final prophecy". but vetrix, isn't this the trap card that... fb vetrix: think of it as a *last resort*, in case things don't go as well as you've hoped. if you *do* use the card you will both suffer the consequences. ...of course, i sincerely hope that you won't be forced to use it. fb trey: but... what if...   fb vetrix : you *did say* you'd do whatever it takes to beat yuma, *didn't* you.  fb vetrix : you may have a chance to prove it.  trey: i activate the trap card "final prophecy". i'll have to destroy my equip card, reducing my monster's attack points trey: but it also stops and destroys your trap card. yuma: no way. you were willing to make atlandis weaker just to destroy my trap card. trey: yes, but it's still strong enough to beat *you*. especially since you only have one hundred lifepoints. keep up your attack, atlandis.  trey: blast utopia ray *and* yuma. yuma: i activate *another* trap card"half unbreak".  yuma: not only does it shield utopia ray from being destroyed, but it also cuts the damage in haaaaalf.  trey: ugh.... yuma... you cannot win.  trey: aagghh. aaaaaggghhh.  yuma: huh. trey.  yuma: you have to stop before this duel destroys you.  trey: i don't *care*. you're in my family's way and i'll beat you no matter *what*.. yuma: you've got it wrong. i'm not your enemy, i just wanna be *friends* with you. trey: that will *never* happen, yuma. i don't need friends. yuma: we all need friends, trey. maybe if we talk this through, i can find some way to *help* you and your family. trey: thank you, yuma...  trey: but it's too late for both of us. yuma: too late for what, trey. trey: unfortunately for us, the final prophecy trap that i used will lead to our destruction.  trey: on my next turn, we'll both take damage equal to machu mech's attack points. and we'll both be destroyed.  tori: *now* what do we do.. bronk: uh, i'm not sure.  bronk : but it looks like this place is gonna lose a *lotta real estate*.  trey: soon you and i will each be down to zero lifepoints. and that, finally, will be the end of it.  trey: this is going to be the last duel *either* of us *ever* has. i feel at peace, because i know there really was no other way to save my family, and i'm sure vetrix will be proud of me.  someday soon, my family will return to normal. yuma: but trey, this isn't the answer.  bronk: the effect from this final prophecy trap's still goin' strong. it's gonna destroy *everything* here. kazwell: the trap can't destroy *us*, thoughit's part of this virtual world. in the end, it *really* isn't there.  kazwell: aahh.  kazwell: no way. even without my duel gazer, i can see that final prophecy trap zapping everything in sight.  kazwell: this is *real*.  act 3 <<12:22  kazwell: that final prophecy trap is gonna zap us. for *real*.  kazwell: we don't have much time.. flip: what're we gonna do.. yuma: ah.... hey, trey. tell mewhat *is* that thing..  trey: i'm not really... sure....  trey: it's from another dimension, i think. huh. mmgh.  yuma: trey..  trey: it's no use.  fb vetrix: the final prophecy card cannot be stopped.  trey: not even my crest is powerful enough to hold it back.  trey: vetrixyour card doesn't just eliminate the *duelists*, it destroys the *whole world*..   vetrix: it appears that trey used the trap card i gave him. quentin: ah. vetrixdon't tell me you gave trey the final prophecy card. vetrix: it has created a portal to barianworld just as i foresaw.  vetrix : once the portal fully opens, it cannot be closed again.. yuma: hey, trey. i need answers, what's going on.. trey: our duel is opening a portal in this world to another dimension, and in a short time, everything around us is going to be swallowed up by it. yuma: *everything*.  tori: us, too.. flip: please, don't swallow meeeee...  flip: i swear i don't taste very good.. trey: trust me... when i activated that card, i didn't realize it would devour the whole world. please... forgive me, yuma. yuma: time to feel the flow...  yuma: you just told me that this interdimensional portal is opening up because of our duel. so all i have to do is defeat you, and that could keep the portal from opening any more. trey: you can't win. since i have less than a thousand lifepoints right now, you can't destroy atlandis. or deal any battle damage to me.  trey: the situation we're in is *utterly hopeless*. yuma: it's *not* hopeless. as long as i don't give up, we all still have a chance.. if astral were here, he would agree with me.   yuma: zexal.... trey: what's that. yuma: it's a mysterious power that astral and i brought about. but now... he's gone. trey: because of me....  trey: yumawhat if you could bring astral *back*. yuma: how could i do that. trey: i used the power of the crest to make astral disappear from here. if i can transfer the crest over to you, then perhaps... yuma: wait. you really think i could bring astral back. trey: yes. but if you fail to gain control of the crest's power, then it will gain control of *you*. yuma: i'll risk it. it's worth it to bring astral back.  yuma: all right. give me the power of the crest, trey.  yuma: aaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh.. astral, come back.. act 4 <<15:50   yuma : astral..  kazuma: astral. astral: huh.  astral: it'syou.  kazuma: hello, astral. my son is calling you. please, you must go and help yuma.  astral: yuma....  astral : yuma. yuma: i can't believeyou're back. astral: i heard you were calling for me... so i came.  yuma: i'm glad... you're here.  yuma : uagh, gh, not thati need your *help* or anything.  tori: everything's gonna be okay, 'cause astral's back.  trey: great.  trey: aaaaaaahhhh.. yuma: huh.  trey: forget me. destroy atlandis before it's too late..  astral: it is time for zexal. yuma: right. so let's *do* this.  yuma : now, you and i will build the overlay network.  bronk: what're they *doin'*.  astral : when two distant souls become one, the power of zexal is revealed. yuma and astral : go, zexalmorph.  tori: yuma and astral just merged together. yuma : let's get this done. haha.  astral : a truly powerful duelist can shape the outcome of a duel. he can even generate the very card that he needs to draw.  yuma and astral : go, shining draw.. appear, zexal weapoooooon. phoenix bow.   yuma and astral : i equip it onto utopia ray. now when utopia ray attacks, your monster is automatically destroyed, and you take one thousand points of damage.  yuma: get ready, utopia ray. attack atlandis now..  yuma and astral : phoenix finish.  trey : the bond between yuma and astral is stronger than i realized.   vetrix: it's trey. he was*defeated*.  quentin: what will happen to him *now*.  flip: hey, *look*. it's the *real* world.  flip: and there's *no sign* of that freaky trap. kazwell: then it can't devour us. in the end we're all okay.  yuma: i won the duel.... astral: yuma. yuma: hmm. astral: we have saved your world. yuma: yeahthat was great teamwork. but... what about trey.  yuma: hey, treyyou okay..  trey: ugh... yuma: are you hurt.  trey: i finally understand, yuma. you accept me as i really am. i can see clearly, now, that you're the *only true friend i have*. yuma: look, trey, i'm sorry if i trey: yuma, i have a favor to ask you. will you do what you can to help save my family. yuma: huh. trey: if you just keep feelin' the flow, i'm sure you'll find a way to make things right.  yuma: trey....  yuma: ...goodbye.  bronk: all right, you and your last heart piece, just in time. tori: you made it to the finals.  tori: yuma. yuma: i promise... i'm not gonna let my friend trey down. i *will* find a way to help his family.  there's no stopping me now..  trey : i failed you, vetrix. forgive me. vetrix: everything will be all right, trey, i promise you. trey: vetrix, will you, hold my hand.  trey: that's *much* better. i think i'll try to get some sleep, now. vetrix: don't let your mind me troubled. rest well, trey. restuntil i settle things with the son of kazuma tsukumo. end <<21:11 * special thanks to animeratio.com for the
