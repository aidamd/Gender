 hey.  cameron: some say photos bring back memories of the past. but mine do the opposite.  cameron: they bring forth the future. and the future shows that you'll be losing this duel.  whadda you know about the *future*, that camera a' yours, ain't even *digital*.  cameron: i can sense the *fear* behind your voice.  cameron: and you're right to be afraid, for you see the future has *now arrived*. aaaaaaahhhh.  cameron: i hope you remember what you *learned* here today. but if, when you wake up, it's at all fuzzy...  cameron: take a trip down memory lane on *me*.  act 1 <<1:50  yuma: ya know... things sure are *crazy* right now. especially with shark. uugghhh....  fb yuma: you're competing in the world duel carnival. fb shark : only for as long as i need to. fb yuma: whaddaya mean. fb shark: as soon as i do what i gotta doi'm out. fb yuma: what're you *talking* about. fb shark: the duelist i lost to in the nationals is in the carnival.  fb shark: i'm gonna settle the score.  yuma: but it's not just him. there's *quatro*, too.  fb quatro: i won't be happy until all my fans get *exactly* what they deserve..  fb quatro: hehehehehnhn. you two twerpsare going down with a *big bang*.  fb yuma: you *maniac*.. they looked up to you. why did you do this to them.. fb quatro: hahahaheheheh, let's just saythat i find it *highly entertaining*.  yuma: it's like no one duels for the right reasons anymore.. tori: huh. yuma: everyone wants *revenge*, or to hurt someone. don't these people *get it*.  yuma: we're all cut from the same cloth. we're a *family*. tori: mmm...  tori: whoa, check it out, yuma, it's an airship. that ship's flyin' high to commemorate the world duel carnival. how 'bout i get tickets for us. it could *really* help you take your mind off things. yuma: nahh, sounds lame. tori: ah, *come on*. yuma : no, tori, *you* come on.. tori: huh. yuma: my problems can't be solved by some *ride in the sky*. tori: you know what. for someone who wants everyone to get along you sure are *rude* sometimes. yuma: no, *you* are.  yuma: ohh, sorry. tori: well yeah, you *should* be sorry, i was just trying to cheer up my friend.  tori: but *forget* it. astral: i am curious, yuma. do you plan to tick off anyone *else* today. yuma: *astral*. mind your business, wouldja. astral: guess so.  yuma: ohh, could this day get any *worse*. act 2 <<4:02  kari: *what's* his name again.  editor: it's cameron clicks, he was some kid that was always coming in my office tryin' to get me to run his *boring photos*.  editor : well he's not just some *kid* anymore, he's the most soughtafter photojournalist there *is*.  editor : every shot 'e takes is *frontpage material*.  editor : i dunno *how he does it*.  editor : but i *do* know i want 'im for *our paper*. kari: so, just *hire him* then.  editor : i *would*. *if* i could find 'im. that's where *you're* gonna come in, kari.  kari: what's that supposed to mean..  editor : the word on the street is, this cameron kid is big into dueling. so it stands to reason that he'd be at the duel carnival. i want you to *find him*, and get 'im to sign an exclusive with our paper.  kari : this kid *better* be as good as they say...  quit it with the *photos* an' *duel* already.  kari: huh. is that....  cameron: these aren't *just* photos. these show your future.  cameron: care to see. kari: huh.  cameron: then again, you'll be seeing firsthand soon enough.  kari: huh.  huh. gah..  cameron: i *warned* you, didn't i. hmhmhmhmhmhm...  cameron: all i have to do is *think and snap*, then whatever i've envisioned happens. no wonder i've *never lost a duel*. kari: never lost.... cameron: and now, my *friend*, here's something for your *scrapbook*.  ugh...  cameron : too bad no number card, though.  kari: wait.  kari: are you okay. i... should've worn my... hard hat...  kari: *these* are the photos cameron took... but... he took 'em *before* any of this actually *happened*. could that mean...  that cameron... can think of a future and make it come true.   kari : lookfor the last time, yuma, do you know him or not..  kari : his name's cameron clicks, *ring any bells*. yuma : no. no bells. kari : are you sure. he's a duelist, just like you. yuma: sorry.  kari: oh, and he's big into taking pictures. i just *know* he's competing in the duel carnival. yuma : look, maybe his *is* and maybe he *isn't*, why d'you even *care*. kari: because he's dangerous, yuma, and someone needs to stop him.  yuma: dangerous. whaddaya mean.  kari : i mean he has the power to *create the future*, and it's a future that's usually not so bright. yuma: create the future. kari: yeah, i know, i wouldn't have believed it myself, yuma, but... i *saw* it, with my very own two eyes. yuma: okay, then. i'll be sure to look out for 'im.  kari : thanks, bro. just be careful, this cameron kid said he's *never lost a duel*. and after seeing this power of his, i totally *believe him*.  kari : contact me the minute you see or hear anything, and i mean *anything*. kari out.  yuma: wow, that's *some trick*. creating the future. i wonder how he *does it*. astral: if what kari is saying is *true*, i suspect... this young man has been possessed by a number. yuma: ya think so. astral: how *else* could he have such power. yuma, let us go. we must find this cameron at once. yuma: man. what is it, 'boss yuma around day'. some manners, huh, tor. ...tor.  yuma: tori. where did she go. astral: you were being mean and thoughtless. so she *left*. yuma: huh. astral: do you not *recall*. yuma: mean and thoughtless. i'm never like that. tori. huh.  astral: observation number seventeen. sometimes individuals speak without listening to what they are saying. this is *dangerous* because words are extremely powerful.  they can hurt... dear friends...  come one, come all.. come onboard the duel carnival airship, and experience the majesty of this great event at a *whole other level*.  tori: ya know what. yuma didn't *wanna* go for a ride. but that doesn't mean that *i* can't go for one. cameron: okay, everybody... tori: huh.  cameron: say 'cheese'.  boys: cheese.  cameron: that's a keeper.  send me a copy. see you later. tori : cameron. cameron.. is that *you*.  cameron: huh.  cameron: *tori*.   cameron: it's been *so long*, tori. i think the last time i saw *you* wasoh, i knowwhen you let me take those portrait shots.  tori : right. and you did such a good job with them, too.  tori : i still can't believe you exhibited them at that *art gallery festival*...  tori : i was so *embarrassed*. cameron: well you *shouldn't* be, you're a *natural* in front a' the camera. so um, d'you wanna go take some *more* shots. maybe over there by the airship... whaddaya say. tori: sure.  tori: are you certain you wanna do this, cameron. i'm not dressed up or anything. maybe i should freshen up my makeup, or brush my hair, or...  cameron: no *way*you look just great. *trust* me on this. tori: wellokay then.  tori: see ya.  act 3 <<10:10  yuma: we've looked *everywhere* for this kid cameron. and still *nothing*. 'course we might have better luck if we knew what he looked like... probably should've asked...  yuma: dah. astral: it sounds as though a duel is in progress. we should check it out.  yuma: ah. wait up.  astral: my word....  astral: a number.  no *way*. the images in those photos you tookthey're now*coming true*.  cameron: go, projection of pain.  yuma: aah.  cameron: i *tried* to warn you, but you wouldn't listen. no matter. after all, a picture's worth a *thousand words*especially when it's a picture *of the future*.  yuma: ohh... cameron: here ya goon the bright side, no redeye.  yuma: it's *really true*. this... kid... he *can* somehow create the future.  oh no. don't worry. you're gonna be okay, pal. astral: the power of this number card is most concerning. yuma: then we better go and *get it*, astral.  yuma: hey, wait up.  yuma: are you cameron..  yuma: fine. *don't* answer me. but i'll *tell you what*you *will* have to answer for what you've done. you've hurt a lot of people, cameroni wanna know *why*. cameron: why.  it's *quite simple*. i do it to acquire number cards. yuma: hah.... cameron: but, numbers are rare. not all of my opponents have them, so, some end up the worse for wear. but that's not *my* problem.  cameron: i'll do whatever i must to accomplish my goalto collect all the world's number cards. and then, the power of my future photos will be even greater. and there'll be *no stopping me*. huhahahahahahaha. yuma: he's definitely possessed by the power of a number card, astral. cameron: oh, i see. you know about number cards, do you. does that mean you *have one*. yuma: that's right. whatcha gonna do about it. huh.  kari: i *told you* to contact me when you found cameron.. yuma: eh, kari. meet cameron.  kari : *nice to meet you*, cameron. i've been looking for you. actually, it's really my *editor* who's been trying to track you down. you may remember him. you used to try and get 'im to run your photographs in the local paper, but, sadly, he always turned ya down.  cameron: hmph, oh yeah. i remember. he always told me that my photos were too *boring*. but my style has *changed* since then. kari: i *know it has*, which is why he wanted me to offer you a job, cameron. but hey, ya know what. i am going to personally see to it that you never get *that* job or *any* job, for any *paper* any*where*.  cameron: let me guess why. might it be, because you think my methods are a *tiny bit reckless*. kari: i don't *know* how you do it. maybe you create the future or maybe you just twist it. but i *do* know one thing kari: enough people have been hurt by your dark ways. it ends, *now*. cameron: no, it doesn't. you see it's *never* going to end.  cameron: because i *make* the future. kari: huh.... astral: seems our worst fears were correct, yuma. now the only question remaining is how do we put a stop to it all. yuma: 'how', is right. cameron: tell you what, kari, why don't i just go ahead and give you one of my photographs. then you can leave me alone and go make your *editor* happy. kari: not a chance. cameron: you're stating to get on my nerves. can't you see i'm *busy*. can't you see that i'm *about to duel someone*. kari: yumathere's *no way* you're dueling this guy, it's too dangerous. cameron: come onthink about this like a journalist. after all, it *could* make for a *pretty good scoop*. but thenthere are scoops *wherever* *i* go. take this snapshot i took earlier. it's *real headline news*.  cameron: go on, don't be scared. have a looksee.  yuma: tori. cameron : oh, d'you *know* her. *such a shame* what happenedor what's *about to*.  cameron: i know *statistically* they say flying is the safest way to travel, but that's not true today.  cameron: and for *tori*, i'm afraid that's some *seriously bad news* indeed. but that's just the start. it only gets *worse* from there. after the crash... *chaos*. heart land city will be an utter shambles. kari: you're a monster. cameron: oh please, you just *report* the news, i happen to *make it*. my offer still stands. if you take the photo now, i'm *sure* you can make the late edition. kari: for the last timei want nothing to do with your photographs. cameron: then you're a fool. yuma: tori. are you there.  yuma: answer me. tori : you better be calling to *apologize*, yuma. yuma: *where are you* right now. tori: i'm on the *airship*. remember when i tried to *invite* you.  yuma : uh, no.  yuma : you have to get off. you have to get off *now*. tori: you're acting *weird*. what's wrong. yuma : you tell *me*.  tori: uh, things are *fine* up here. the view of the city is *totally* amazing. yuma: are you sure about that. there are no problems. tori : *no*, none whatsoever.  tori : aaahhh. yuma: tori..  tori: that's the left engine. yuma: toriwhat's happening..  tori : aaaaaaaaahhhh. yuma: hang on, tor.  kari: that's enough. you put a *stop* to this, *right now*, cameron. cameron: sorry. what's *done is done*, i'm afraid. kari: no way. you control the future, you can change this. cameron: but don't you see. this isn't the future anymore, it's now the *present*. and i never said i had any control over the *present*, now, *did* i. kari: you little *twerp*.. cameron: if you lay *one finger* on me you'll only make things worse. now if i were you i'd quit wasting time and try to help those *people*.  kari: heyyuma. yuma: huh. kari: i'll figure out how to save the airship, *you* keep an eye on cameron.  cameron: ah, at last she's *gone*, which means *finally*, *we* can *duel*. yuma: astral... when a person possessed by a number loses in a duel *and* loses their number, they return to *normal*, right. astral: right. yuma: so then there's a chance... that *everything around us*... will go back to normal, too. astral : it is hard to say. maybe. yuma: then let's go'cause i'm feelin'the flow...  yuma: duel disk, go..  yuma: duel gazerlet's roll..  computer: authentic reality vision link established. yuma: all right, then, let's *do* this, cameron.  yuma: hey, whaddaya doin'..  cameron: the same thing i do to *all* my opponents. i'm *taking your photo*.  cameron: herethis is what you have to look *forward* to, yuma. i will *warn* you, though, it's a bit of a *spoiler*.  cameron: as you can see, victory is mineand so is your number card. act 4 <<18:08  cameron: as you can see, my victory is assuredand your number card is as good as mine. in fact, you might as well hand it over to me *right now*. yuma: rrgghh*no way*.  yuma: i'm not buying into your camera tricks. yuma and cameron: let's duel. yuma: i'll take the first move. here goes*my* draw. first i place a monster facedown in defense mode. then i'm just gonna place a card facedown and end my turn. cameron : very wellmy turn. and i'm summoning out cameraclops.   astral : yuma placed gogogo golem facedown in defense mode. it has fifteen hundred defense points. the monster *cameron* played, cameraclops, has just fourteen hundred attack points. that is *good news*. it means yuma is safe for at least this *one* round. cameron: i now activate the equip spell "telescopic lens" from my hand. and what better place to attach a lens, than a camera.  cameron: but this doesn't *just* mean a better *picture*. it means cameraclops gains four hundred attack points for every card in my hand. i have four. so that's an additional sixteen hundred attack points.  yuma : that's still not enough to take down golem. when it's in defense mode, its special ability prevents it from being destroyed in battle once per turn. cameron: next from my hand, i activate the spell card "negative image inversion".  cameron: and it's *especially* negative for *you*, because now i can switch one of your facedown defense monsters, into a *faceup attack monster*.  cameron: and there's *another* development. your attack points now swap out with your defense points.  yuma: what.. cameron: since i used image inversion, i now have one less card in my hand. so cameraclops loses four hundred attack points.  cameron: but in the *big* picture, i think we *all* know that *you're* the one who's *really* losing. now. go, cameraclops. attack gogogo golem.  yuma: waaaaaaaaahhhugh.  cameron: hnhnhnhnhnhnhnhn... reporter : this is a special news bulletin.  reporter : an airship above heart land city is in grave danger.  someone help us..  tori: just relax, little girl, everything's going to be just fine i hope. yuma: don't you worry, tori. i'm gonna make *sure* it's all okay. cameron: but it's *not*. like i told you beforethere's no changing what's already happened. and you'd better believe there's no changing your fate, either, yuma. it's already been decidedyou'll summon number thirty nine utopia on turn five, then, on the following turn, you'll be defeated by my number card. yuma: huh.... cameron: you know, yumasome say when a person snaps a *photo* of someone, their soul is doomed. well, it turns out, they were *right*..  end <<21:29 * special thanks to animeratio.com and hulu.com for the copy of this episode transcribed online. * special thanks to yugioh wikia as a source for checking cards. * special
