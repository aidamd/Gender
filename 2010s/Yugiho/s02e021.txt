  act 1 <<2:27  yuma, kite, quatro, trey: let's do this. quatro: hehehehehehyou'll soon be *humiliated* like my *other* fans. kite: i'm no *fan*i just wanna win this duel and get my little brother *out of* here. quatro: keep dreaming, kite. heheheheheh. i could best you guys even if i kept this *hand* behind my back.  yuma: mmgh. why don't you give your *mouth* a rest, too. let's duel. astral: do not allow him to provoke you. that is quatro's strategy. yuma: yeah, i know. if we lose our cool, then *he's gonna win*. orbital: you wanna *win*. then lay low, you meddling pest, and *stay out of master kite's way*.. tori: *what* was that.. orbital: yuma doesn't have *half* the skills of kkite. tori: is that *so*. orbital: well... he *ddoesn't*... tori: don't insult my friend or i'll cut off your power supplyya *got that*.. orbital: er, yyes, ma'am.  hmph, this girl's a real *pain in the pprocessor*... quatro: it's on. i'm up first. hyah.  i summon gimmick puppet egghead.   quatro: i activate its special ability. once per turn, egghead lets me send one card in my hand to the graveyard, so i can deal eight hundred points of damage. yuma: he's not allowed to do that. astral: true, he cannot attack on the first turn of a tag duel, but this is *not an attack*. yuma: rrrgghhh. quatro: i send my gimmick puppet dreary doll to the graveyard. do your damage, and *clobber kite*.  yuma: you okay. kite: worry about yourself. yuma: not a chancewe're on the same team. quatro: i end my turn with a facedown. nowit's *your move*, kite. but don't mess this up, or who *knows* what may happen to your brother. kite: that's *it* you're goin' *down*, quatro. i'm activating the field spell "photon world".  yuma: hold onwe're dueling in *outer space*.. but that means aaaaaaaaahhhhh. *no oxygen*. astral: take a deep breath, would you. yuma: huh. eheheh... kite: next up i'll summon photon crusher.  kite: now due to my photon world, if i summon a photon monster, anyone who doesn't have one on their field gets hit with damage equal to my monster's level multiplied by a hundred.  astral: what.... yuma: hang on a second... i don't *have* a photon monster out.  i'll be taking damage just like them.. kite: it doesn't matter, since i don't *need* you. i can rescue hart *all by myself*. dueling in space can be *risky*especially during a *meteor storm*.  tori: ah.  tori: kitehowdareyouinjureyour ownteammate.. quatro: no sense of loyaltyhnh. i *admire* that. kite: i'll put one card facedown and end my turn. yuma : you just sold me out.  kite: ...hmph. yuma: all rightthen i'm not gonna worry about *you either*. astral: yes you will. in order to win this duel, you *must work together*. yuma: tell that to *kite*. he *started* it, ya know. astral: *think*, yuma. there is much more at stake here than your pride. remember, you are dueling for *hart*.   yuma: you're right. i promised to help him, and i can't let him down.  yuma: i forgot. quatro: it's *hopeless*, yuma. yuma: huh. quatro: *neither* of you will save hart because you're *both fools*. yuma: huh.... quatro: you're a *twerp*, and kite's a reluctant warrior who was pressured into fighting to save his little brother. *isn't it true*, kite. that doctor faker and mister heartland promised you they would cure hart's illness if you served them by collecting numbers.  yuma : i was right. you *do* hunt numbers to help cure hart.  quatro: it's true. kite may seem *tough and ruthless* but the truth is he's really just *desperate*. he'd do *anything* to save his *precious brother*. the story's so tragic, *i could cry*. heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh... yuma: you should've told us, kite. why did you keep it a secret. kite: i don't want your *sympathy*, yuma. all that matters to me is collecting the number cards i need. then i'll take *yours* when i get the chance. yuma: he's hunting numbers... to cure hart... but he can't if *we* gather all the numbers instead.... astral: yuma, keep your focus on *this duel*. if you lose now, there will be no hope for hart under *any* circumstance. yuma: yeah, you're right. *stay focused*. trey: i'm next. i draw.  quatroi'm gonna set up the combo.  trey: first i'm playing chronomaly golden jet.  trey: next up, i activate my "chronomaly resonance" spell card. using this spell, i can summon *another* chronomaly monster, whose level is one greater than my chronomaly jet. huh. rise up, chronomaly moai.  trey: now i'll activate, golden jet's special ability. with it, golden jet gains one level. astral: so he has *two* levelfive monsters now.... trey: i overlay my levelfive moai, and my golden jet.  trey: and with that, i can now build the overlay network, and xyz summon number thirtythreechronomaly machu mech.  yuma: i never saw a monster that needed its own *zip code* before...  trey: my machu mech is gonna *wreck* your lifepoints. act 2 <<8:54  trey: with my machu mech in play, i'll end my turn with two facedowns. your move. yuma: that thing's gianormous.. astral: remember that trey and quatro possess other numbers as well, yuma. you *must keep your guard up*. yuma: don't worry. i will. get readyi draw. i summon, ganbara knight.  yuma: and since i summoned a level four monster, i can also summon out this guycome on out kagetokage.   yuma: i'm *really* feelin' the flow.. i overlay level four ganbara knight and kagetokage.  yuma: and now that i have, i can build the overlay network and xyz summon. quatro: *please*. without a number you're *wasting your time*. yuma: well, then, quatro, since time is of the essence, say hello to number thirtynine, utopia..   trey: he has.... quatro: a number..  quentin: how interesting... quatro: this can't be. how could that *twerp* get a number card. trey: i wish i'd known that *before*. hey quatroi'm worried this kid may be able to see through our strategy. he *did* watch my duel against shark after all. maybe we should change our game plan.  trey: *quatro*. quatro: huhuhuhuhuhuh, hahahahahaha. that's *quite the surprise*. but know that an even *bigger* surprise is in store for *you*, yuma. yuma: rrrgghhh.... astral: yuma, place a card facedown. quatro and trey are *very skilled*, and you must fortify your defenses. *stay alert*. you must be ready for any scenario they throw at you. yuma: you *got it*. i end my turn with two facedown cards. quatro: it's *my move*, *now*. hyah. better hold on to your decks. because i'm activating my "level doubler" spell card. now by sending one card in my hand to the graveyard, i can double the level of my monster. i think i'll send another gimmick puppet dreary doll to the graveyard, to give egghead an eggstra boost.  quatro: and since i have *two* dreary dolls in my graveyard, i can banish one, and bring the other one back to my field.  astral: quatro is clearly setting the stage... so a number card can be unleashed. quatro: i overlay leveleight gimmick puppet egghead and dreary doll.  quatro: i xyz summon number 15. gimmick puppet giant grinder.  act 3 <<12:11   yuma: number fifteen. kite: that thing is *powerful*. astral: yuma, this situation is *most* alarming.  tori: i've *seen* that number....  tori : quatro used it before to destroy bronk and kazwell's monsters.  tori: unh.... trey: time for *me* to step in and activate my "number wall" trap card. my number is now protected, so there's no way you can destroy it with any spells, traps, or special abilities. astral: a trap that shields his number.... yuma: it's *totally invincible*. astral: yuma, this is bad.  quatro: your number is *up*, kid. yuma: ugh. quatro: i activate giant grinder's ability. now by using one overlay unit giant grinder can destroy every other xyz monster. say 'byebye' to utopia.  yuma: hold up. using that ability will destroy your *teammate's* number also. quatro: hmhmhm. *wrong*, kid. trey: number wall will shield my monster, so it won't get destroyed. your *utopia* won't get so lucky, though.  astral: trey and quatro played this perfectly. i am afraid there is nothing we can do to save utopia. yuma: are ya sure.  astral: number fifteen is simply too powerful. utopia's destruction is unavoidable. yuma: uh, what about its special ability. astral: no good.  astral: it is hopeless. yuma: nooooooo.  quatro: it gets a *whole lot worse*. gimmick puppet giant grinder's gonna deal a whole lot *more* damageto *you*.  quatro: you're taking damage equal to utopia's attack points.  tori: yuma. are you okay..  astral: watch out. giant grinder has fifteen hundred attack points. if quatro attacks you with it, then you will lose, and, kite will be alone. yuma: rrgghh. astral: yumayou *must summon damage mage*. yuma: yeahgood idea. i'm playing damage mage in defense mode.   yuma: whenever a special ability harms me, i can summon damage mage. it restores my lifepoints back to where they were *before you used your ability*.  quatro: ugh. you *spoiled my plan*. *you little twerp*. but don't think you've stopped me. go, "attack gimmick". thanks to this, giant grinder gets five hundred more attack points until the end of the turn, so it can *really* lash out at its enemies.  quatro: and then, if my powered up gimmick puppet giant grinder destroys your monster in battle, you take damage equal to the destroyed monster's attack points. which is *bad news*, and that bad news is comin' *your way*, kite.  quatro: giant grinder. eliminate kite's photon crusher.  yuma: but since they have the same attack points, they'll *both* be destroyed. astral: no, that giant grinder is a number, and only *another* number can destroy it. yuma: aah. quatro: giant grinder, attack.  quatro: kitei'm gonna *crush* your photon crusher. then i'll crush *you*.  act 4 <<15:42  quatro: say goodbye to your photon crusher.  yuma: no..  orbital: master kite..  quatro: ha ha ha ha ha ha. ah huh ha ha ha ha. feel like giving up *yet*, kite.  yuma: no one's giving up, 'cause i activated "impenetrable attack" to protect my partner.  quatro: a trap card. yuma: that's right. see, since i activated this trap, i was able to keep kite's monster from being destroyed. astral: and since *photon crusher* survived, *kite* did not take any damage, either. quatro: rrgh. you're starting to get on my *nerves*, kid. i end my turn.  kite: yuma. d'you think i need your help to survive. yuma: i'm just trying to be a good teammate. tori: what an ingrate. and yuma *just saved his monster*.  orbital: sorry, but saying 'thank you' isn't master kikite's *style*... kite: *don't help me*, we'll always be *enemies*, yuma. anyone with a number card will be taken down *by me*. hold onyou're doing this for *astral*. yuma: you're wrong. that's not true. i know you plan to carry out your mission no matter *what* i do. kite: huh. yuma: i told youi made a promise to hart. hart wanted to see his big brother again. and i swore that i'd bring both of you back together.  quatro: will you two *stop*. you're supposed to be fighting *me*not *each other*. i do *not appreciate* being ignored.. what's the matter with you guys, don't you find me *threatening enough*.. tori: i just find him *obnoxious*. quatro: *i* have an idea. *this'll* get your focus on me. i'll give you both an *inside look*at poor, helpless hart. feast your eyes on *this*..  hart : brother....  orbital: oh, nooo....  kite: let my brother go *now*.. quatro: that's not gonna happen. by the time we're finished it'll be too late to help hart.  he may not even *recognize* you once we're through with him. kite: you *animal*..... trey : don't push it. quatro: what's the *matter*. oh waityou must be feeling *guilty*. you *know* you don't have what it takes to win this duel and save your little brother. heheheheheheh, ahahahahahahahaha. kite: quatroaaaaaaaaaaaaaauuuuugggghhhhh.... quatro : *do it*, kite. use the card i've been waiting for. then your brother's fate will be sealed and so will yours. kite: you're *through*, quatro..  guah. yuma: *think* about what you're doing, kite. kite: first i'll summon photon thrasher.   kite: by summoning photon thrasher, photon world's effect is activated. you should've turned hart over when you had the *chance*, quatro.  kite: i'll keep hammering away 'til you're *forced* to release him..  kite: nothing's gonna stop me from freeing my brother...  kite: i'll destroy *anybody* who stands in my way.. yuma: chill *out*. astral: with two powerful monsters on his field, kite is now prepared to make his move. kite: i tribute my photon crusher and photon thrasher. so that i can bring out one of my most destructive monsters.  kite: be afraid, quatroooooo... come, my mighty monsterwith the savagery of a supernova.. bring on a cosmic cataclysm that vaporizes everything in your path...  kite: come forth, galaxyeyes photon dragon.  quatro: stupendous.. trey: are you sure this was a good idea, quatro. quatro: kite doesn't have a *clue* what's coming. *trust me*. trey: i hope this works, for *our* sake...  astral: oh, no. since kite summoned another photon monster, photon world's effect activates. yuma: waaauuugghh.  kite: galaxyeyes, take aim.. attack giant grinder. go, photon stream of destruction..  quatro: kite *fell for it*..  trey: i activate the trap, "stonehenge shield". if you attack with a monster with three thousand or more attack points, this card not only *deflects* your attack, but your monster's attack points get zapped down to zero.  kite: *zero*.. trey: yes, and it loses all of its special abilities.  trey: your galaxyeyes is now *completely powerless*. it's too weak to put up any kind of fight. astral: those two *wanted* kite to summon galaxyeyes.... they set him up. trey: machu mechuse your special ability... by using one overlay unit, you take damage equal to the difference in your monster's previous and current attack points. go, infinity cannon..  trey: readyaim*fire*...  quatro: thanks for the *duel*, kite, it was fun while it lasted. now say goodbye to your dragon's attack pointsand get readyto say goodbye to your lifepoints..  yuma: kite.. no..  end <<21:22 * special thanks to
