just reach out and *take it*.. yuma: well, if you insist, all right.  tori: *yuma*, we're gonna be late for class *come on*, let's *go*.  bronk : if ya moved your legs, it might help a little. yuma:

time, yuma, but just like a *coin*, fate won't always land in your favor. very soon i'm taking you down. act 2 <5:24> mr. kay: so as you can plainly see...  mr. kay: finding the percentage of air in this vial of sand is the easiest way to...   astral: this is a complex structure. what is its *purpose*. but more importantly... what role does *yuma* play.  astral: oh *my*....  astral: could this

i tell you to do *more homework* and to stop with all the *dueling*.. yuma : yeah. ya did. and i am. kari: then what is *this*.  yuma: 'to my dueling hero yuma, from your biggest admirer.'  yuma: aw, cool. it's *fan mail*.  yuma: i meannot cool, bye. kari: *yuma*. when is he gonna learn that *no dueling* means *no dueling*..  kari: can *you* talk to him.  kari: i'm just worried, grandma, because we *both know* what dueling can lead to.  yuma: hey, where've *you* been *hiding out*. anyway, look whatcha *missed*. my *first fanmail*. i'm so excited, i can't wait to see it.  yuma: hello. don'tcha think maybe a 'congratulations' is in order here..  *someone out there likes me*. wish i could meet 'em and give 'em a big hug. *and* an autograph.<8:00> astral: so. tell me why your sister does not want you dueling. yuma: huh.  don't worry about my sister.  now, let's rip this baby open. astral : observation number eight. humans have ears, but that does not mean they listen. yuma: haha.  yuma: heythis is a baby tiragon card just like the one flip tried to give me....  yuma: ah.... hi, yuma. i saved up for a *year* to get you this. i hope you like it.  yuma: wow. i'm the luckiest guy around. ha.  yuma : i can't believe i've got an xyz monster..  flip : yes, indeed you do, yuma.  and i've got you *right where i wantcha.*  flip: but that card's just the start. next, the plan is to get you *all alone and friendless*. then you will be at my mercy.. act 3 <8:58>  <9:00> yuma: good morning. kazwell: yuma.  kazwell: you have got a lot of nerve showing your face around here after everything that you've done.  yuma: umm, what, what exactly did *i* do. kazwell: i know it's hard, but don't play dumb. you know the *least* you could do is *admit* it. we've *all* seen the photos.  kazwell: they were sent out to the whole school. and all i have to say is you should be ashamed of yourself. stomping on flowerbeds.  kazwell: pulling pranks on teachers.  kazwell: cheating during exams.  kazwell: but the worst thing you did was eat spencer's lunchand replace itwith a *toad*..  kazwell: *check out the look on your face*. yuma: whoa.... i didn't do that.. heywhere's spencer.. i gotta clear my name. tori: we can't *find* spencer.  tori: he must be home *sick* or something. bronk: still, we're with yuma. there's no *way* he'd do those things. kazwell: i used to feel the *same way*, bronk. *we all* did. that is, right up until we saw these *awful pictures*.. sorry, yuma, but we're not friends anymore. <10:00> come on, everybody, let's go.  yuma: wait. please. no. seriously... kazwell: i guess in the end there's *another side* to yuma... a side we *never knew*. let's go. yuma: but i swear, i'm innocent.  flip : time for step *two*.  yuma: man. it sure stinks, having everyone upset at you.  yuma: i guess bronk and tori aren't. but the rest of the school sure is.  flip: yuma. hehehehey, how's it goin' pal. yuma: hey, flip.  flip: hmhmhmhm.   flip: wow, it sounds like you got a bum rap. yuma: *tell* me about it. now i'm the school outcast. flip: *that is not true*, yuma. you're no outcast. yuma: huh.  flip: like i said beforei've liked you ever since i heard you beat shark. that was one of the best duels *ever*. yuma: wow, really. <11:00> ...thanks. flip: by the way, what *was* that card that you used to take down shark. *you know*, uh... yuma: you mean utopia. flip: huh. oh, right.. *that* was it.  flip : so *that's* his secret weapon.  astral : strange. that *dark aura* is getting stronger. this is quite troubling.  flip: well, yuma, no matter what anyone says about you, remember that flip has always got your *back*.  astral : what was that. yuma: in that case, you know what would *really* cheer me up. a friendly duel. flip: ha. i was hoping you'd ask, yuma. i'd love to. yuma: ah, really. flip: oh, absolutely. in fact, old pal, *i insist on it*. yuma: ha. yeah, let's do this, then. flip : yes, let'sand once we're finished, utopia will be *mine*.... astral: i have a bad feeling about this duel. i think you should pass. yuma: what for. ...wait, lemme guess*you* think that flip is up to no good, too.  flip: huh. yuma: well then, <12:00> why would he stand by me in my time of need. flip: hmm. yuma : wait a secondyou're not *jealous*, areya. flip: uhh, are you talkin' to *me*, yuma. yuma: nope, just to myself. anywaylet's get on with this duel. because i am *feelin' the flow*..  yuma: duel gazer, let's roll. duel interface, set.  computer: augmented reality vision link established.  yuma and flip: let's duel..  flip: i'll go first, if it's okay. here goesdraw.. i place a monster facedown in defense mode. that's it for this turn. yuma: playing it safe by shoring up your defenses, huh. flip: i *better* play it safe when i'm facing a duelist as good as *you* are, yuma. both: hmm. astral: i believe your opponent's praise is masking his true motives. yuma: no, he just thinks i'm a great duelist. flip: huh.... yuma: is that so hard to believe.. ahh, wait a secdon't answer that... <13:00> let's get back to the duel.  since flip summoned a monster in defense mode, it's played *facedown*. now i can't see how strong a defense it has, unless i attack it. *but*, if i *do* attack, and his monster's stronger than *my* monster, i 'm gonna take damage.  get set to get decked. *i draw*..  i gotta summon a monster with high attack points.  i summon gagaga magician.  yuma: now, gagaga magician, attack that facedown monster. flip : i was *hoping* yuma would side with this aggressive approach.  porcupine fish, appear.  yuma: four hundred defense points.... all *right*, gagaga magician wins. flip: flip effect, activate. yuma: what's a flip effect.. flip: you musta missed that day of school, yuma. it's a special ability that activates when a monster that's facedown is flipped face*up*. <14:00> wanna know what its flip effect is.. you now take four hundred points of damage..  yuma: pretty cool movebut gagaga magician *still* has higher attack points.  flip: my monster. yuma: better luck next time. i end my turn.  flip : well played, but i expected no less.  stilli took away lifepoints from the mighty yuma tsukumo, yaahaa. the duelist that took down the infamous shark.  yuma: he sure seems happy. astral: interesting. so he is a flip effect monster user.  tori: okay, thank you.  tori: huh. i don't *get* it. spencer's mom said that he went to school today like he always does. bronk: yeah... but he's *nowhere to be found*. tori: heymaybe there's a hint as to what's going on in those photos. bronk: ya think. tori: it's worth checking. anything that will prove yuma's innocence.  <15:00> flip: my turn.. here we go. i play a monster in defense mode. yuma : facedown again. he must be planning to use another flip effect. flip: then i'll end my turn with two facedowns.  astral : yuma had better be careful. flip's field is stacked. yuma: all right, *my turn*. i draw. first, i summon flelf.   yuma: now i'll use it to attack your facedown monster. astral : but yuma.. do you not recall what happened last time.. yuma: of course. but who cares if i take flipeffect damage. if flelf destroys that facedown monster, i can attack flip directly with my magician. now, go. flelf, attack that facedown monster. flip : yeees, please do.. act 4 <15:53> yuma: flelf, attack flip's facedown monster. <16:00> flip: chewbone, appear.   yuma: three hundred defense points. that'll be a piece a' *cake* to beat. flip: and now for, chewbone's flip effect.  flip: with it, i can summon up to three chewbone juniors from my deck, onto *your field* in defense mode.   yuma: huh..... you summoned 'em to *my* field..  flip: *i am so cool*. didja see how i pulled that sweet summoning off. yuma: yeah, i sure did, flip. but they won't do you a whole lotta good *way over here* on *my* field. flip: what. *your* field. ohh, nuts, i misunderstood the effect. astral : so you say... yuma: ahh, don't beat yourself up over it. happens to us all. but, a duel's a duelcan't letcha off the hook.  yuma: i now attack you directly with gagaga magician. <17:00>  flip: aaaaahhh.... yuma: yes. i'm winning. thirtysix hundred lifepoints to twentyfive hundred.  yuma: and with that, i end my t. flip: oh. wait. *hold up* there. yuma: huh. flip: aren'tcha gonna summon your *xyz monster*. yuma: my xyz.... flip : the guy doesn't even *realize*.....  you know, because of the *summoning mistake* i just made.... yuma: huh.  flip: the mistake i made that brought out the *three levelone chewbone juniors*....  yuma: right. i've got three levelone monsters out, which means i can do an xyz summon. flip : then *do it* already. astral : there is *no doubt* yuma is being set up. but why.  astral : wait a moment..... *of course.* yuma: i overlay these three levelone chewbone juniors. next astral: no. flip: heheheheheh.  yuma: i will use this overlay network to summon forth, an xyz monster. appear, baby tiragon.   yuma: all right, i did it.. i summoned an xyz monster.. flip: hahaha. aahhahahahahahahahahaha. yuma: huh. flip: you sap. you *bought it*. yuma: i... bought what. flip: my right facedown is the trap "ultra c". astral: "ultra c"..... flip: thanks to "ultra c", when baby tiragon is summoned out to your field, *i* can summon one xyz monster to *my* field oh, and there's one more thing. i have to summon it *straight from your deck*. yuma: my deck..... flip: yup*which means*, utopiais *all mine*..  flip: you summoning baby tiragon was the worst thing that could've happened to you. yuma: uh..ahh.. <19:00> astral: flip planned this from the very start.  astral : in order to get you to get you to summon baby tiragon, he *purposefully* summoned those chewbone juniors to your field.  yuma: no, that's impossible... i mean, think about it. flip didn't even know that i *owned* a baby tiragon.  flip : i saved up for a *year* to get you this.  hahahahaha. yuma: ahhh.....  ...i hope you like it.  yuma: so then, that card was sent by *you*..  flip: that's right. and i was *also* the one who sent around all those fake photos of you to the *entire school*. i *knew* it would make everyone hate you. yuma: but why.. flip: because i *needed to get you alone*, yuma. and besidesi knew if you were down about everyone disowning you as their friend you'd finally let *me* be your friend. and *friends duel*. and that *note on your back* tells you what we're dueling *for*. yuma: what in the world.  yuma: bet this doesn't say 'kick me'...  yuma: 'if i lose this duel, i agree to give flip a card from my deck.' astral: this is *not good*. <20:00> yuma: that's no fair.. flip: that note was on you , so *you must honor it*.. ha. astral: what a snake. yuma: my friends warned me that you were always up to no good. flip: hmhm. yuma : i guess this is what i get for not listening to them. so *fine*, which card of mine is it that we're playing for.. flip: why the card you beat shark with, of courseyour utopia card.. astral: utopia's a number card. if yuma loses *that*, then i, too, shall be lost.... flip: now that we know the stakeslet's get on with the duel.. shall we.. now "ultra c", activate.. and with your power i summon utopia from yuma's deck..  flip: rise uputopia...   yuma: so now i gotta take on my *best monster*.... <21:00> this isn't gonna be easy.  end
