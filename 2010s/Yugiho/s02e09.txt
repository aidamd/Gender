tori: this is a dangerous shortcut.  yuma: if we go around we'll miss the *previews*, tori. tori: you're dragging me through a construction site for *previews*..  yuma: i don't even care about the movie, but they're gonna have the trailer for the next bruno battalion sequel. i *gotta see it*. astral: why is she nervous. what exactly *happens* at this place known as a 'construction site'.  yuma: *construction* happens, what else. they're building some kinda *giant, new mall*. it's gonna be the biggest in the *world*, i heard.  tori: *come on*, yuma. i don't like this. yuma: it's totally safe.  yuma: aah. tori..   act 1 <1:37>  yuma: tori.. tori: aaaaaahh.  tori: iis this your idea of *totally safe*..  yuma: ahh.... jump.  <2:00> yuma: you okay, tori. tori: i'm good. unh... yuma: what was *that* all about.  yuma: wha.. no one's driving.  cody: you numbskulls aren't wearin' *helmets*. don't you guys know that construction sites're *dangerous places*..  cody: sorry for almost turning you into pancakes. i saw the beams falling and tried to hit 'em outta the way, and then accidentally put the excavator into *gear*, and then i couldn't reach the *dumb brakes* to stop it. yuma: how does a *kindergartner* even get onto a construction site and accidentally *do anything*. cody : a *what*. a *kindergartner*.. i'll have you know that cody callus is in *middle school*. i'm just*vertically challenged*.  yuma: oh. we're in middle school, too, cody. tori: i'm tori, and this is yuma. thank you for trying to save us. that was *so brave*.  yuma: you *okay*, pal. cody: what's everyone lookin' at..   yuma: what a huge truck. <3:00> cody: ahh, that's *gracie*. she can haul, like, three hundred hogs. yuma: that's, maybe, the most amazing thing i've ever heard. all those *pigs*.  cody : not *real hogs*.  cody: my old man and his crew refer to *tons* as *hogs*. tori: your dad works construction. cody: yeah. he's the foreman on this site. yuma: no *wonder* you know so much about this stuff. astral: this concerns me.  astral: those enormous beams over there appear to be held together by *nothing more than a few metallic pieces*. that strikes me as a precarious arrangement. yuma: what's that *big machine* up there. cody: *that* is burnaby. that thing could lift a *mountain*.  tori: something tells me we're not gonna catch that movie *or preview*... yuma: it'd be *so cool* to drive that thing... cody: because it'd make ya feel all *superstrong*, right. yeah... that's pretty much why i decided to step up and compete in the world duel carnival. yuma and tori: huh. cody: i may be a little guy, but when i'm dueling, and i'm controlling these powerful monsters, i feel bigger than i am. makes me feel like there's *nothing* i can't do. <4:00> yuma: i know *exactly* what you mean. cody: so, uhdoes that mean *you're* in the duel carnival. yuma: yup. cody: *really*. well, i hate to break it to ya, but no one stands a chance against my heavy machinery deck. yuma: you only say that because, you haven't seen *my* deck. cody: *oh*. sounds like a challenge. yuma: it is. let's do this.  yuma: hope you're ready.  yuma: duel disk, go.. duel gazerlet's roll.  computer: augmented reality vision link established. yuma: get set to get decked.  yuma and cody: now let's duel. act 2 <4:38> cody: you ready to rumble.. i'm going first. i draw. and i'm kickin' things off by summoning a *monster*. here comes, jumbo drill.   <5:00> cody: next i activate the "charging construction" spell card. since i summoned jumbo drill, charging construction lets me bust out another heavyhitter in defense mode. get ready to tremble before the sheer awesomeness of my mighty *road roller*.   cody: and now i activate jumbo drill's special ability. since road roller is on site, jumbo drill gains three hundred attack points. yuma: ahh, *man*. those machines a' yours are *pretty sweet*. astral: not the response i was expecting. your opponent just summoned *two monsters*. yuma: d'oh. cody: i end my turn by throwin' one card facedown. bam. now you're gettin' to see what my mighty machines're all about. yuma: and now you get to see what *i'm* all about. first upi'm summoning gagaga magician.  <6:00> astral: yuma, look at the attack and defense points of your opponent's monsters. i'm sorry to say it, but gagaga magician cannot put a dent into either one of them. yuma: oh *man*, what was i thinking..  this isn't good... astral: perhaps an *equip spell* would help. yuma : i, was just about to say that. from my hand, i activate the "bound wand" equip spell. astral: when a monster is equipped with bound wand, it gains one hundred attack points for each of its levels.  cody: eh, that's a pretty neat *stick* an' all, but even with that powerup, your magician isn't strong enough to put a *dent* into my machines. yuma: rrrggghh... astral: yuma. need i *gently remind you* that gagaga magician's special ability allows him to change levels, once per turn. yuma: oh yeah, that's right. by activating gagaga magician's special ability, i can change him from a levelfour, to a leveleight.  astral: which means bound wand can grant him another *four* hundred attack points. yuma: and now, gagaga magician, attack jumbo drill. <7:00> cody: bring it on. 'cause i'm playing, the trap card "foreman's fury". so now, a thousand a' your magician's attack points are about to disappear into *thin air*.  yuma: no way. cody: oh, yes way.  yuma: whoaaaaa. tori: yuma.  astral: use bound wand's effectnow, yuma.  yuma: yeah. i was *gonna*. when the monster equipped with bound wand is destroyed in battle, that monster can *return* to the field when the battle ends. astral: that will help. but the situation is *still dire*. yuma: mmmhh. astral: you should focus on defending. that way you will not take battle damage if your magician is destroyed again. yuma: good call, astral. i return gagaga magician in defense mode. <8:00>   yuma: then i place one card facedown and end my turn. cody: do you seriously think you can defend against the power of *my heavyhitters*. let's *find out*. i draw. i'm summoning strong shovel excavator to join me on the job site.  cody: now that strong shovel is dug in, jumbo drill gains another three hundred attack points.  cody: and now, strong shovel's gonna dig into your gagaga magician. astral: yuma..... yuma: i'm activating the "half unbreak" trap card.  yuma: with this trap card in play, my monster isn't destroyed, and the damage i would've taken is cut in half. cody: not too bad, there. you and your monster got through that without so much as a *scratch*. <9:00> heheh. well then, i guess i'm gonna have to find some *other* way to hammer you into the ground. yuma: you can *try*, but half unbreak's effect remains in play. cody: huh. too bad that's not gonna stop jumbo drill from attacking.  cody: and jumbo drill's got a *special ability*.  cody: when your magician's in defense mode, and jumbo's attack points're greater than your magician's defense points, the difference is dealt to you as damage.  cody: mmhmhmhahaha.  ya see that. that's what my machines're all aboutjust tearin' down absolutely anything that's dense enough to stand in their way.  yuma: hey, how come it's in defense mode now. cody : oh. yeah, uh, well, uh, thing about jumbo drill is after it attacks it's gotta go on defense until the end a' my next turn. mandated union break, i guess. eheheh, it's construction humor. <10:00> yuma: that sounds like it would be kind of a pain to have to deal with. cody: heyif you want heavy machinery to do what heavy machinery does best, maintenance is a *must*.  cody: 's like my dad always says, heart land city wasn't built in a day. astral: this is your chance, do not waste it. yuma: i'm on it. it's my turn now. i draw. let's make this *happen*. first i'm switching gagaga magician to attack mode. next i'm summoning, mystical donator.   yuma: mystical donator is *all about giving*. once a turn he's willing to give up his attack points yuma: and either give 'em to another monster on my field, or give 'em to *me* so i can increase my lifepoints.  yuma: this time, mystical donator is going to give his attack points to gagaga magician. cody: gah. nuts and bolts. yuma: yah. and with that, gagaga magician attacks strong shovel excavator.  yuma: dig *that*.  <11:00> yuma: i place one card facedown, and end my turn. and now, gagaga magician and mystical donator return back to normal.  yuma: those superbig machines a' yours pack a lotta power, but dueling isn't *just* about power, cody. astral: interesting. what *else is there* other than power. yuma: aiughh... ya know, like uh, *tactiles*. astral: you mean *tactics*. yuma : i'm just sayin' it's not about bein' big and powerful.. cody: of *course* it is.. two guys suddenly get into a fightthen the bigger one *wins*, the bigger one *always wins*.. yuma: ah... what're you talking about. cody: 'half pint', 'short stack', 'small fry'ohh, i've been called all *sorts* a' names.  cody : back in elementary school the big kids made fun a' me. pushed me around, took my lunch money... one day, i was workin' at a job site my dad was workin' at, watchin' the machines do their thing.  cody : and that's when it hit meya know who stands up to a *bulldozer*.  cody : *no one*, that's who.  cody : 'cause ya don't mess with power. <12:00>  cody : people *respect* power when they see it. they get scared by it.  cody: me an' my machines. we're gonna show the duel carnival what power's all about. then we'll see how many people are calling me 'little stuff' or 'bitesize' or whatever. yuma: but, cody... cody: i'll show you what i mean.  hah.. to kick things off, i'm activating the "scrap and build" spell card. scrap and build gives me the goahead to summon a lowlevel machinetype monster straight from my graveyard. strong shovel's gonna pull a double shift.   cody: ohand uh, when this card is summoned from the graveyard, it *gains* a level.  cody: next up, i'm activating another spell card. "overhaul". this doozy improves work efficiency across the board, by granting every machinetype monster on my field an *additional* level.  yuma: ugghh.... cody: i hope you're ready<13:00> 'cause you're about to see *real* power. astral: yuma, this is bad. cody: i overlay jumbo drill, road roller, and strong shovel excavator.  cody: with these three monsters, i build the overlay network. here comes the aweinspiring, pulverizingthe ultimate machine in my crew. i xyz summon, digvorzhak, king of heavy industry.   yuma: thirtytwo hundred attack points.... cody: yep.  cody: and digvorzhak is gonna use them to finish you. act 3 <13:38> cody: i xyz summon, digvorzhak, king of heavy industry.   yuma: thirtytwo hundred attack points.... cody: yep.  cody: and digvorzhak is gonna use 'em to finish you. when you absolutely have to demolish something, accept no substitutes. astral: yumathat monster is strong. <14:00> yuma: yeah. cody: first, i activate digvorzhak's special ability. by using one overlay unit, digvorzhak can knock three cards outta your deck, and haul 'em off to the graveyard.  yuma: you gotta be kidding me.... cody: now, for every monster that was tossed into the graveyard, a monster on your field is destroyed. yuma: for real..  yuma: you managed to yank *two* monsters, so that meanscody: your field is about to become a demolition site. go. molten mover.  mystical donator: waaahh. tori: yuma's totally *vulnerable* now.... yuma: if he comes at me with a direct attack, i am *donefor*. astral: try to stay focused, yuma. cody: all right, digvorzhak. it's fullthrottle time.  yuma: gah. so loud. it's like an earthquake. astral: yuma. play your trap card. yuma: huh. hey<15:00> what did you say. 'try to clap hard'. cody: more power.. rev that engine and give it everything you got, digvorzhak. i'm talkin' *maximum overdrive*, baby.. astral: yuma, listen.. *you need to activate your trap*.. yuma: i can't hear you. 'captivating a crab'. cody: let's end this. go, wheel of wrath.  astral: use your trap. activate it.  yuma: oh*activate the trap*.  yuma: i'm activating a trap, "small resistance". when one of your monsters is attacking, i can choose a levelfour or below monster with one thousand or fewer attack points, and *your* attacking monster loses the same amount of attack points as the monster i chose. i'm going with, mystical donator.  yuma: uuaggghhhh...  tori: yuma.. cody: you keep somehow managing to survive my attacks. <16:00> you won't be so lucky *next* turn. yuma : ugh... my field is empty, and i'm hanging on by a lousy one hundred lifepoints. how'm i supposed to take down a monster *that huge*. astral: what is that monster *made of*. yuma: huh.  astral: think about what is holding it *together*, yuma. after all... yuma: speak up, astral.  sometimes he can be so *frustrating*. astral : and sometimes *you* can be stubborn.  yuma: oh yeah. well... hey, how come i could *hear you* that time. astral : because i went with telepathy. we *can* communicate that way, remember. yuma : ohh, yeeeeah. astral : and now that i have got you, i have made the following observation about this place known as a 'construction site'. these gigantic structures that you humans create, are comprised of *many individual parts*. yuma : okay. and. astral : take for instance that hexagonal piece by your foot. yuma: huh.  yuma : this thing. <17:00> it's just a nut. astral : consider how tiny that piece is. and yet, it will contribute to the support of this colossal structure.  astral : every piece plays an important role. without even the smallest of components in the right places, the entire foundation could collapse.  yuma: i think you're talking about *dueling* now.  cody: whatsa matter, yuma. have you been frozen in place by awesomeness. don't be hard on yourself. it happens to *lotsa* people. yuma: i draw.  yuma: all right. kurivolt. haha.   cody: look at that dinky little pipsqueak. what could *that* runt do to my machine. it's just gonna scratch its paint job. yuma: it's gonna do a lot more than *that*, once i activate its special ability.  cody: wwhat's happening to digvorzhak's overlay units.. <18:00> yuma: kurivolt can seize overlay units, and change 'em into kurivolt tokens.  cody: are you serious. iit can turn overlay units into *monsters*. well ain't that somethin'. stillhow're those *three little monsters* supposed to take down a machine like digvorzhak. yuma: with the help of a spell card, called "miniguts". go, kurivolt tokens. do your thing.  cody: hehehehehehaha. nice try, pal. but *nobody* can stop my ultimate machinenot even you.  act 4 <18:44>  yuma: go, kurivolt tokens. take out digvorzhak.  cody: hehehehehehaha. don't you see, *nothing* can stop my ultimate machine*'specially* nothuh.  cody: what.. what's happening to digvorzhak..  astral: excellent work, yuma. using the miniguts spell, you were able to tribute two levelone monsters to strip his machine of attack points.  tori: this seems promising.... cody: butthis ain't rightthose little monsters're so *pathetic*. astral: you can finish this right now. yuma: heh. digvorzhak's outta gas. and nowkurivolt's gonna race in and shut that machine down for *good*.  <20:00> yuma: ha.  cody: waaaahhh. yuma: then, due to miniguts's effect, you take damage equal to digvorzhak's original attack points. i am shuttin' your machines down.  yuma: aw, *yeah*..  cody: agh, nuts 'n' bolts.  something *that small* isn't supposed to be able to take down something that big. yuma : you shouldn't sell little guys so short, cody. cody: whaddayou mean. yuma: well, look at this *humongous building*. think about how many tiny pieces are combining to hold it all together. <21:00> i'm just sayin'little guys are capable of big things.  cody: here ya go, yuma. yuma: huh.  cody: ya beat me. so, my heart piece is *yours* now. don' waste it.  yuma: don't worryi'll take it all the way. tori: you've got *three* now, yuma.  cody: ya know, i think i lost because i underestimated what little monsters are capable of. which really means, i underestimated what *i'm* capable of. tori: hey, codywe were on our way to a movie. yuma: iiihhh.  tori: you wanna come with us. cody: uh, eh, deh, well, see, ihehehaha, hahahahaha...  astral: 'little guys are capable of big things'...
