  act 1 <3:00>  bronk: you ready, yuma.. i summon ufo turtle in attack mode.  yuma: shoulda stayed in your *shell*, turtle. 'cause gagaga magician's comin' for ya.  kazwell: i must admit. sometimes yuma confounds me. if *i* suffered the epic fail that he just experienced against shark, i'd seriously consider hanging up my duel disk for good.  bronk: i play "rush recklessly".  yuma: oh no. it's getting *more* power.. kazwell: perhaps, in the end, yuma simply doesn't have any pride.  bronk: ufo turtle. attack gagaga magician.  yuma: uuuaaagh. kazwell: that's *twenty losses in a row*.  yuma: nice baitn'switch, bronk. i did *not* see that spell card coming.  yuma: come onone more time. kazwell: you *still* feel like dueling. yuma: of coursewhat future duel champion *doesn't* feel like dueling  yuma: come on, big guy. bring it on. bronk: meatloaf's gettin' cold. tori and kazwell: huh. <4:00> bronk: i'm goin' home. yuma: hmm. ... oh well. looks like you're up, kazwell. bust out your deck an' let's *do this*. kazwell: huh.. tori: bronk. hey, wait up.  tori: what's wrong. bronk: i *just don't think i like* who yuma's turning into. that duel...  bronk : with shark... yuma said he wouldn't use a numberbut thenhe *did*.  bronk: he *went back on his word*. and that's not right.  tori: you know how he is, he just gets *carried away*, andbronk: there's a *big difference* between *getting carried away* and what he did.. you don't break a promise just 'cause you're losin'..  tori: wait a sec.  tori: ...bronk's right.  haha. *denied.* nice move. heheh. gotcha. weasel: hey, shark.  weasel: ya want next game. shark: ... no thanks.  weasel: hmph. <5:00>  shark: i'm outta here.   weasel: that new fish is getting on my last nerve.  weasel: he acts like he's so much better than me an' the rest a' the boys. scorch: just deal with it, weasel. 'cause that new fish is worth a lot more to us than you're *ever* gonna be. weasel: uhh. scorch: we didn't let shark start runnin' with the pack because we like his winning *personality*. we let 'im start runnin' with us because we like his *winning*. and if he wins for *us*, we can take down whoever we want.  yuma: hey, bronk. hold up.  yuma: let's have a duel. bronk: i'm *done* dueling *you*, yuma.  yuma: ... *fine* then. i don't need to duel *you*i know better people i wanna duel *anyway*.  astral: i would not bother. yuma: hmm. <6:00> astral: in your current state of mind, you could duel a *tree* and still lose. yuma: mm. astral: your strategies are *always* sloppy and illconceivedbut right now, you do not even have *those* at your disposal. you just keep attacking, and attacking, without any thought. yuma: you don't know what you're talkin' about..  astral: your recent defeat against shark has rattled you. yuma: huh. astral: but, yuma, while it *is* true he is a fabulous duelist, i strongly suspect that it is not the only reason he won. yuma: whaddaya mean by that.. astral: he seemed to have taken the time and analyzed *your* deck and figured out *your* strategies. how much do *you* know about *his*. yuma: well, uh...   weasel: so, are we, just *talkin'* about doing this, or, ya know, are we *talkin' about doin' this*.  chills: ohh, we're *talkin' about doin' this*.  reporter : ...the exhibition centerpiece is an extremely rare and powerful duel deck, which was donated to the museum by an anonymous benefactor.  reporter : a panel of leading experts has yet to confirm *just who* the deck originally belonged to. <7:00> chills: heh. well after tonight, that deck's gonna belong to *us*. weasel: this seems really dangerous. what about museum security.  weasel: what if we get busted.. they'll catch us and my parents'll send me to boarding school, and. chills: *look*, ya little worm. if you wanna run with the pack, you need to start acting like a *wolf*.  weasel: ii know, i'm just sayin', maybe we. scorch: we're gonna be *fine*. don't forget, weasel, we've got *these*.  shark : a number card....  chills: these are our tickets in.  chills: as long as we got *these* bad boys, we can do whatever we wantand *no one* can stop us. scorch: all right, then. we'll meet by pier fourteen at midnight tonight. weasel: well, but, what about. chills: come onwhatsa matter, little *weasel*. ya chicken.. weasel: *no*, just....  chills: why, what are *you* doing out here. i hope you weren't listening in on our *private conversation*. <8:00>  scorch: 'cause if you *were*, we might have a *problem*.  shark: hm. well, i *was*and i want in. weasel: huh..  scorch: then you *got* in. just don't *get in* the way. 'cause if ya doyou'll have to deal with *me*.  act 2 <8:15>  weasel: this is not good. i'm gonna spend my life eating cold cafeteria slop and armwrestling for respect. i can't armwrestle. i have, like, zero upperbody strength, my family is *all legs*, we're not built forshark: listen, there's a fivefifteen train outta town. *you* should be on that.  weasel: eh. but what about all my friends and my stuff, and... how much is a ticket, 'cause i don't shark : *just go*..   yuma: ugh... *why* is finding info on shark so hard. what does 'invalid path' mean. tori: you don't come to the library much, do you.  tori: you're in the wrong browser.  tori: you wanna click *here*.  tori: last year's national duel tournament. <9:00> yuma : just, checkin' something out.  tori: 'disgraced contender reginald kastle was disqualified when...' shark's real name is *reginald*.  yuma: ...i didn't know that.  tori: 'duelist reginald kastle was disqualified in the finals, when it was revealed that he had secretly looked at his opponent's deck in violation of tournament rules'.  weasel: i hope nobody sees me leavin'. train, here i weasel: wwaiti can't just leave shark to those guys.  tori: *unbelievable.* shark was *kicked out* of the tournament. yuma: it's gotta be a lie. tori: but the *article said*. yuma: i know, but... i've *dueled* shark, tori. i can tell he's got the heart of a true duelist. he's *not a cheater*. tori: *yuma*... weasel: hey..  yuma: you're one a' those guys that shark hangs out withright. whadda you want. weasel: shark'sintrouble. <10:00> yuma: whaddaya mean, what kinda trouble.. weasel: he an' the other guys, are gonna break into the museum and steal that rare deck. it's all 'cause a' those *cards* they got.  weasel: ever since they got 'em they've been doing crazier and crazier things. astral: yuma, are you thinking what i am thinking. weasel: i know how these guys roll. they're probably gonna make shark take all the blame. he's gonna go *down*, he's.  weasel: huh.. tori: yuma, hang on a second.  tori: shark's trouble. mmaybe it's best to forget 'im.  yuma: i can't, tori. i *have* to help him. tori: but, why. it's not like he'd do the same thing for *you*. yuma: you don't get it.. i'm not just doing this for shark i'm also doing this for *me*. i *lied* to myself, tori.  yuma: i wanted so much to cream shark the other day, so much that i broke my promise and used a number... and lost. now... shark's in dangerall because beating him mattered more to me than helping him.  <11:00>  chills: *why hasn't weasel shown up here yet*.. scorch: forget about 'im.  chills: but he was gonna be ourscorch: *i said forget 'im*, chills. we don't need 'im anymore, now that we've got shark.  scorch: let's roll.   scorch: who are you. shark: huh.  yuma: i'm the kid that's gonna stop you from doing what you're about to do.  scorch: really.  chills: this isn't a sandbox you wanna *play* in.  astral: they both have number cards. <12:00> yuma: if you guys wanna take another step forward, you're both gonna have to duel me. chills: is that so. what's the wager. yuma: if you manage to defeat me yuma: then *my* number card is yours.  shark : he's out of his mind.  yuma: but if i win, then you walk away from this museum. chills: his card's just like *ours*, scorch.  scorch: i get it. so this is called a number card. imagine how strong we'd be if we had *another* one. are you sure that you wanna do this, pipsqueak. yuma: i'm sure. i can take both you guys. shark: yuma, don't be crazy. two on one.. yuma: i won't back down. i'm not gonna step aside and let you throw your life away, shark. shark: save it, yuma. i don't need you lookin' out for me.  yuma: sorry, but i can't just turn away. these thugs don't care about you, shark, they're just *using you*.  shark: hm. how d'you know i'm not using *them*. either wayi'm right where i belong, yuma. yuma: you're wrong. you're *better than this*, reginald, <13:00> and you *know it*..  shark: huh. yuma: i'm gonna get you to cut your ties with these lowlifes, if it's the last thing i do. shark: why d'you care so much about what happens to me.. yuma: i care because i'm your friend, shark.   bronk: *forget it*. i am *not* *goin'*. tori: he *knows* he made a mistake, bronk. and to make up for ithe's about to duel so he can save shark's skin. yuma needs his friends.  tori: aren't you his *friend*. ... *well*, bronk. scorch: we need to clear somethin' up. chills: when you challenge *one* of us, you challenge *all* of us. scorch: this isn't *two* on one. this is gonna be a *three*onone battle. chills: you ready, shark.  yuma: whatever you say. i don't care if it's two or three or *five*, 'cause i'm fighting for my friend.  shark: actually it's gonna be *twoontwo*. scorch: it's *what*.. chills: you really think that you can *betray us*.. <14:00>  yuma: are you sure. shark: don't get the wrong idea. i'm just not really a big fan a' these guys. chills: well, guess whatwe ain't big fans of *you* either. scorch: 'cause you see, sharkchills: heh. scorch: if we got *caught*chills an' i were gonna see to it that *you* took the fall. hahahaha.  yuma: well the only people who're gonna fall *tonight*are *you two*. duel disk, go..  yuma: duel gazerlet's roll.  computer: augmented reality vision link established. yuma, shark, scorch, chills: let's duel..  act 3 <14:41>  scorch:  whaddaya say we get this duel started. it's *my turn*. i draw. i place a monster facedown in defense mode.  <15:00> scorch: next, i end my turn by placin' two cards facedown. astral: it is apparent from the way they are interacting, that these two are used to dueling as a team. yuma: i'm not worried. here i *go*. haha. i summon, zubaba knight.  zubaba knight: zubaba *knight*. yuma: that facedown monster is looking like an easy target right now. go, zubaba knight. jump inshark: not so fast, yuma. yuma: why not. shark: 'cause in a tag duel, you can't attack until all players have taken at least one turn, smart guy. yuma: oh. really. in that case, i *end my turn*. scorch: what a rookie. this is gonna be a *piece of cake*. chills: it's my turn. i *draw*.. i summon pompadour blizzardon.  chills: then i place two cards facedown, and end my turn. once this train gets goin', it doesn't *stop*. scorch: you are gonna wish you stayed in *bed* tonight, kid.  shark : well *you're* gonna wish you stayed outta the water. <16:00> 'cause i'm summoning, big jaws.  shark: and that lets me also summon shark stickers.  shark: see, i can bust out *this* monster whenever i summon a fishtype monster to the field. yuma: that's two levelthrees backtoback. do it. shark: i overlay big jaws and shark stickers.  shark: with these two monsters, i can build the overlay network, and xyz summon, submersible carrier aero shark.  yuma: he xyz summoned on his first turn. that is *all kinds of awesome*. shark: and now i activate its special ability. once a turn by using an overlay unit, aero shark can dish out four hundred points of damage for every card in my hand.  astral: an excellent move.  astral: he is skirting around the rules by using a special ability to deal damage. shark: since i've got *four* cards in my hand, <17:00> i'm serving up sixteen hundred points of damage to scorch.  yuma: that's what i'm talkin' about. scorch: ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. yuma: huh. scorch: ...we were hopin' you'd do that.  chills: i activate my trapblizzard egg level five.  chills: when a special ability deals damage...  chills: blizzard egg enables the duelist who *took* damage to summon one levelfive monster from his hand. but if he has no monster to summon, then that duelist gets slammed for five hundred points of damage himself. yuma: so *that* means... astral: he is gambling on scorch having a levelfive monster in his hand, which is quite a reckless risk to take. scorch: let's see... heheh... i summon levelfive baggy pants lavasaurus.  scorch: and now, to *really* heat things up. <18:00> i activate my trapflame egg level five.  scorch: when i take damage from a special ability, flame egg grants my teammate the power to summon one levelfive monster from his hand. but if he's *not* holding one to summon, then he takes five hundred points of damage. yuma: this can't be good. chills: you're about to learn why *nobody* messes with *us*.  act 4 <18:33>   astral: something is not right here. *both* of them have levelfive monsters waiting in their hands. yuma: aw, man. they summoned two powerful big guys in *one move*. and it wasn't even their turn. chills: that's because we've mastered the art of the *extended* combo. scorch: did we forget to mention that no one has *ever* defeated us in a tag duel. astral: there is something *not quite right* about this scenario. <19:00> why are these two so confident. shark : i think i smell a *rat*. scorch: and now, our combo's big finale. glare level five.  thanks to the power a' *this* trap, you take five hundred points of damage for every levelfive monster on our field. we've got *two* levelfives out, so we're talkin' a *thousand* points of damage. and it's *all for you*, shark.  yuma: are you okay..  scorch: huh. that'll teach you, traitor. shark : i place two cards facedown and end my turn. yuma: i just had to step up and act all tough. what was i thinking. ...what if i'm still too rattled. shark: stay focused, yuma. yuma: huh. shark: we're not gonna win this thing if ya start feelin' *sorry for yourself*. yuma: uh...  he's right. it's like astral said. i let my defeat rattle me. <20:00> i can't do that. i gotta stay strong.  scorch : and now the fun *really* begins. first i switch my facedown monster to attack mode. here comes flamesaurus.  bronk: a tagduel.. why're yuma an' shark on the same team. scorch: flamesaurus's special ability activates. and that means *it* becomes level five. now i can overlay flamesaurus *and* baggy pants lavasaurus.  scorch: with these two monsters, i build the overlay network. i summon number sixtyonevolcasaurus.   yuma: okay, wow. that's, like, humongous. bronk: *look* at that thing..  chills: nice goin', scorch. scorch: i'm not *done yet*. i'm gonna make it known what *happens* to little chumps. i activate volcasaurus's special ability.  scorch: by using *one overlay unit*, one of your monsters is destroyed, and you take damage equal to its attack points. say byebye to aero sharkand say hello to a world of *hurt*..  scorch: *don't you know* who we are, ya little *runt*. nobody gets to betray the pack an' then just *walk away*.  shark: aaaahh. yuma: no. shark.  chills: i wouldn't be worried about *him*... scorch: 'cause *next*, i'm destroying your little *zubaba knight*. <22:00>  yuma: yaahaaahaaaaahhh. tori: yuma.  yuma: ughh...  my *grandma* punches harder than *that*. scorch : huh. big words comin' from a bug who's about to be squashed. chills : your number card's as good as *ours*.  end <22:33> * special thanks to animeratio.com for the copy of this episode transcribed online. * special thanks to yugioh wikia as a source for checking cards. * special thanks to kazuki
