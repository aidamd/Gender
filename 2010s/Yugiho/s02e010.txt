 yuma: aw, man, this is *just* my luck. i get my *third heart piece*, and *then*, *it won't fit*..  yuma: why me.. it's not like i *swiped* the thing, i *won it*, fair and square.. tori: i dunno what to *say*, yuma, hearts have a funny shape.  tori: maybe the piece you have isn't the one you need to complete the puzzle. see, there could be *tons* of combinations. yuma: *tons*.. so what're you saying, i might have to win a *thousand pieces*.. astral: not to pile it on, but... heart pieces are not the only thing we're here to win, if you recall. yuma: eheheh... astral: as you said, our main goal entering the duel carnival is to retrieve number cards. yuma: when did i say that.. i never said *that*.  yuma: i want heart pieces. i *love* heart pieces. i anna: target acquired. goodbye, yuma.   act 1 <<1:50  yuma: look out.. tori: ah.  anna: ugh. just missed 'im.  yuma: rrrgghh. this *augmented reality* is getting a little *too* real if ya ask me. tori: augmented reality.. this is *real*, yuma. yuma: euh.  anna: one more time.   yuma: this way. come on. anna: stay still, wouldja..  yuma: astral. whaddaya see, whaddaya see..  astral: from what i can tell, you're under attack. yuma: no joke, genius.  yuma: quick, tori, this way. tori: right.  anna: you can run anna: but you can't hide, not from my hovercraft.  anna: and we have, liftoff.  anna: there is no escape. tori: aaah. she's right behind us, yuma, what're we gonna do..  astral: i suggest running faster. anna: ha. and now i've *gotcha*. yuma: look out.        yuma: there. we made it.  yuma: there's no chance that she'll find us wayuphere...  anna: i wouldn't be so sure..  anna: any last words. 'cause now's the time anna: uuuugghhh... act 2 <<4:07  yuma: uh... you okay.  anna: quiet. i'm taking you out. you *know* you have it coming. yuma: hold on. why do i have it coming. i don't even *know* you. you sure i'm the one you wanna blast. anna: ha. i'm *absolutely* sure, i'd never forget *you*yuma tsukumo.  tori: huh.. hold on, is that *you*, anna. yuma: aanna. tori: yeah, anna kaboom from school, don't you *remember*. she transferred out two years ago. yuma: doesn't ring a bell...  anna: so i'm easy to forget.. is that what you're suggesting, yuma....  yuma: no, no, i remember now. it's crystal clear. i could never forget someone so *charming* as you. tori: wait, so why *exactly* are you after yuma, anna. anna: i'm after him because i want to get my revenge. yuma and tori: get your revenge.. anna: got that right.  for what he *did to me* back then. or *didn't do*... yuma: huh.. anna: ya see.. right there. that's the problem.. you're completely and totally oblivious. oh, just *shush*..  tori : i *think i know what's going on here*... anna: you... you never noticed me. yuma: whaddayou mean.. why should i have *noticed* you..  anna : because i put glue on the bottom of your shoes.  anna : i scribbled notes all over your duel disk...  anna : i cut little holes in your gym shorts.  anna : i hid rocks in your duel fuel.  yuma: really. *you* did all those things to *me*. wow. y'know, you'd really think i'd *remember* all that. anna: you're telling *me*. how could you not know i was headoverheels in *love* with you. that's why i was trying to get your attention... but nothing i did *worked*. *then*, i had to transfer to another *school*.. tori: ohh... anna: i asked you to meet me after class... i waited, and waited, but you never showed up.  anna : *that's* when i made a solemn vow.  anna: i'll get you for this, yumaaaaa...  anna: and now it's time for payback. so get ready, *yuma tsukumo*'cause i'm here to collect.  yuma: uhaaaaahhhh. wait. just hold on a sec. before you start collecting anything, maybe there's *another* way to teach me a lesson. ya knowby doing something that'll *really* make me suffer.  yuma: like *beating me in a duel*. tori: huh.. anna: a duel, huh. tori: yuma, anna wants to *blast* you, not *duel* you. she'll never *go* for it. anna: works for *me*. tori: whaa.. anna: let's *do this*.  anna: it just so happens, i've *always known* how much you like dueling. so i *thought* you might suggest this.  tori: at least he's *safe* for now... anna: *however*, if i win our match, then you have to become my boyfriend. tori: aaahhh.. anna: cool. yuma: no way you'll be *winning* so that's *fine with me*. tori: *yuma*. anna: all right, then let's get started. yuma and anna: duel disk, extend and set. duel gazer, activate.  computer: authentic reality vision link established.  yuma and anna: now, let's duel. astral: human love is such a peculiar thing... *and* packs such serious firepower...  anna: ladies first, in *this* matchso here i go. it's mydraw. for my first move, i'm summoning rocket arrow express.   yuma: aaah. it's got five thousand attack points.. that train's gonna derail my duel. astral: how is anna able to summon such a strong monster on her first turn. anna: this card can only be summoned when i have no other cards on my field. so since my field was *empty*, voila. however, to keep this card *out there*, i'll have to send five cards from my hand to the graveyard every turn. yuma: five cards every turn.. yaah, i dunno what you're up to, but i don't like it *one bit*.  anna: *however*, i can't attack on the turn rocket arrow express is summoned, and when it's on the field, i can't place any other card facedown, *so*... i end my turn. which means you're up, yuma, so *bring it on*. yuma: right. here i go. i draw. astral: yuma. rocket arrow is too powerful to take down this turn. yuma: *right*. so i'll just set the stage for *next turn*, then. first up, i'm placing one monster facedown in defense mode. then i'll place another card facedown and end my turn.  anna: playing hardtoget, areya. *i'll* fix that. i draw. i choose to discard *zero cards*, which means rocket arrow's wrecked.  astral: oh, my.... anna: next, i'll place five cards facedown, and then, *end* my turn. yuma: what.. why'd'ja get rid a' that *super powerful monster*.. now you left yourself totally *defenseless*.. astral: i guess love *does* work in mysterious ways. anna: now, *come on*, yuma, and give me your very best shot. yuma: all rightyou want it, you *got it*. my turn. i draw. first upi summon gogogo giant.  yuma: now gogogo giant attacks you directly.. astral: ah. yuma: and if it hits, you'll be taking two thousand *giant* points of damage. now, *go*. astral: wait, yuma, what about the five facedown cards she has out.. anna: i destroy all five facedown cards on my field. go onget lost.  astral: what.. anna: and now, i'm gonna summon to the field snowplow hustle rustle.  anna: i'm allowed to summon it when you attack me directly, simply by destroying *all the spell and trap cards* that i have out on the field. but enough *talk*let's just *plow ahead*.  yuma: whoa, twentyfive hundred attack points. gogogo giant, quickcall off the attack.  anna: oh, you're not getting off *that* easy, yuma. snowplow hustle rustle, i'm activating your special ability.  anna: *now*, you take two hundred points of damage for every spell and trap card i destroyed to summon it. yuma: so with five cards destroyed, that's a *thousand points*.  yuma: uuuuaaaggghhhh..... tori: yuma. anna: a thousand down, and three thousand points to go.. yuma: so anna *planned* this move from the very beginning. astral: that *does* seem to be the case... anna: yes.. i'm *so* gonna win this and then you'll be mine.. so let's hurry up and finish this. astral: you must be careful, yuma. i have a hunch anna is setting up something big. yuma: uhhuh, i know. i just hope we can stop whatever it is. oh, wha' do i *do*.. tori: i dunno, but i hope you figure it out. anna: moving on. my draw. and hmm. it's *just the card i wanted*. go, "special schedule". thanks to this spell card, i have the *green light*, to summon one machinetype monster with three thousand or more attack points from my graveyard in defense mode.  anna: so *all aboard*'cause rocket arrow express is now *back*.  yuma: and it's like i'm *tied to the tracks*. astral: two levelten monsters, this is not good. anna: i know in years past, i could never get your *attention*. but i have a hunchthat this next move *will*. i now overlay levelten rocket arrow and hustle rustle.  anna: and with this overlay network, i can now summon, an xyz monster.. appear.. superdreadnought rail cannon.   yuma: three thousand attack points.. astral: so *this* is what she has been angling for. anna: but the best part of this *choochoo* is the change it undergoes when i activate its ability.  anna: but don't take *my* word for it, see for yourself.  anna: once per turn, by using one overlay unit, you now take two thousand points of damage..  yuma: gotta say, that thing's pretty coolbut it'd be a lot cooler if it weren't pointing at me.. anna: now, superdreadnought, unload on yuma. goo, cataclysmic cannon kablooie..  yuma: waaaaaaaaaahhh...  tori: ahh.....  anna: yeah, yippee.. i'm winning, i'm winning, i'm winning.  anna: there's just one thousand lifepoints left before you lose, yuma. yuma: rrrrgghhh... anna: and once you've lost, you know what that means. for the rest of your life, you're all mine.  anna: so *whaddaya say*, handsome. let's make that dream come true. go, superdreadnought. attack gogogo giant and *win this duel* for me.  tori: oh no.  act 3 <<13:30  anna. go, superdreadnought. attack gogogo giant and win this duel for me. tori: watch out.. yuma: it's cool. 'cause i play, the trap card "overlay buster". now my monster gains five hundred attack points until the end of battle.  anna: clever move, yuma. so you survive *this* turn. but i promise, you won't survive the next one. yuma: ya know, i hate to admit itbut with superdreadnought's special ability, anna may just be *right*. i have to take that train off the tracks. but with it hauling three thousand attack points, it won't be easy.  astral: it will not, but it *is possible*.  yuma. then what're you *waiting for*, tell me how. astral: i cannot just *blurt it out*...  astral: ...at least not without a proper *drum roll*...  yuma: a *drum roll*. ... i *got it*.  yuma: it's time to highfive the sky.  here we go.. draw. first i summon zubaba knight.  zubaba knight: zubaba *knight*. yuma: next i summonrai rider.  yuma: hehehthen i overlay levelthree zubaba knight and rai rider.  yuma: and now that i have, i can build the overlay network and xyz summon.  yuma: nowhere's the *drum roll* you asked for, astral.  yuma: i summon, temtempo the percussion djinn.  anna: ha. he's only got one thousand defense points. yuma: yeah, that's truebut it's his special ability that you should *really* be worried about, anna.  yuma: ya see, when temtempo uses one overlay unit, your xyz monster *loses* all of its overlay units. anna: it does *what*.. yuma: and then for every overlay unit that was sent to the graveyard, temtempo gains five hundred attack points.  yuma: toldja he could *jam*. and jam *up* superdreadnought, 'cause now you can't use its ability. astral: correct. and since temtempo is in defense mode, we will not take battle damage either. yuma: i now place two cards facedown and end my turn.  anna: but don't think you're ending this duel. make all the moves you want, yuma, but i'm going to win you yet.. act 4 <<16:05 anna: you're *not gonna beat me*, yuma. you can make all the moves you want, but i'm still going to win you yet..  it's *my turn*. i draw. and first, i'm activating the equip spell known as "train connection". now, by banishing two leveleightorabove machinetype monsters in my graveyard, i can equip train connection on a machinetype monster, and double its attack points so i can *really* stay on track. yuma: yeah, *i'll* say.  yuma: six thousand attack points.. anna's *really* outdone herself *this* time, astral. astral: and i do not even think she is done yet. anna: and i've got *more* news. due to train connection's effect, when the equipped monster attacks a monster in defense mode, if its attack points are greater than *your* monster's defense points, the difference is dealt to *you* as damage. yuma : carry the one, subtract the remainder, divide the square rootah. i'll take five thousand points of damage if your attack gets through.. anna: that's right, which would mean thatthe duel's over and you're mine, sweetums.  yuma: igghhh... anna: aww, don't tell me that you're going to *cry* like that time before. yuma: *what* time before. anna: oh, you remember. when i took your card.  fb young anna: if you want your card back, yuma, you'll just have to come up here with me.  fb young yuma: but i'm afraid of heights. come on, give it back. anna : i was just playing *around* with you, but then you started *tearing up*. fb young yuma: come on, give it back to me, wouldja.  tori: wait a sec... yuma: but i'm not *afraid* of heights. anna: well you were back then. yuma. was *not*. i was only afraid of spiders and the dark and toes. anna: guess i'll just have to jog your memoryby knocking some sense into you. you're going down.. yuma: ugh... astral: that is not a good thing to hear. not when you only have a mere five hundred lifepoints remaining. yuma: you are *not helping*, astral. astral: then again, if you had the right *facedown cards*, that could be *great* news. yuma: huh. anna: this is it, yuma. you're all mine. yuma: ha. of course. anna: go, superdreadnought rail cannon. attack temtempo. tori: oh no.. anna: *bash* that little drummer boy. yuma: i don't think so. i'm playing the trap, "gamushara".  yuma: with this card, my monster switches from defense mode, to attack mode. anna: only twentytwo hundred attack points.. come on. you know that's not enough to beat superdreadnought. yuma: i know that it's not, anna. that's why i'm playing this next card, too. i activate the trap, "mirror mail". now my monster's attack points become the same as *your* monster's attack points.  tori: all right yuma, way to feel the flow..  anna: uugghh.  anna: no way.... yuma: oh, and another thingthanks to the trap card gamushara, since your monster was destroyed, you take damage equal to its attack points, which is *six thousand*.  anna: uhoh. yuma: nowdo your thing, gamushara. and let anna know what it's like to be on the *other* end of a cannon blaster. anna: ohhh....  anna: aaaaaaahhhh....  yuma: i did it.  anna: no way.... i lost. but *hooooooow*......  yuma: i'll *tell* ya how, anna. 'cause ya brought a *giant cannon* to do a job that a lesser monster could've done. anna: rrrgghhh.. yuma: kinda like how you went *way overboard* trying to blast me earlier, when all you needed to do was ask me to talk.  anna: nooooo... tori: umm, i dunno if it's the right time to say this, but...  anna: rrrrggghhh..  tori: wasn't the person you liked name *kumo tsuyuma*, rather than *yuma tsukumo*.  anna: uh yuma: kumo tsuyuma.  yuma: oh yeah, i totally remember him. he was that kid who cried a lot and was really afraid of heights, right.    anna: ah. well it's *your fault* for having a similar name. *i hope* that you've learned your lesson.  yuma: hey. *wait a second*. what about my heart piece.. anna: heart piece. what's that. yuma: it's what you give me when you lose a duel. anna: well, *tough*. i don't have one. yuma: ah. hold on, are you telling me that you're not even *competing* in the duel carnival.. anna: *please*, i've never even *heard* of it.  yuma: well ya shoulda told me that from the getgo.. aw, man, what a complete waste a' time. tori: i had a hunch something was fishy from the very start. yuma: hmm. tori: i mean why would a girl ever like *you*. yuma: *hey*, i'm *likeable*. astral: it is a shame to see her go, though. yuma: huh..  astral: after all, those who duel for love duel with great passion. yuma: oh *yeah*. well i'd love if you'd keep your theories to yourself.  anna: yuma tsukumo... cute. mmmhmhmhmhmhm.  anna: ugghh. i blame *you* for that, yuma tsukumo.. and i'll get my revenge.. end <<21:47 * special thanks to animeratio.com for the copy of this episode transcribed online. * special thanks to yugioh wikia as a source for checking cards. * special thanks to kazuki takahashi, 4kids, et al. for yugioh. zexal. last updated: january 28, 2013 i don't own yugioh zexal, at all, and this transcript is unofficial and without any permission whatsoever. please link back to me if you use my work. for more information about my transcript format, please click here. read my blog post on this episode here  )
