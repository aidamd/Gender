  kite: hey, hart. you there.  kite: why aren't you answering me. he's *gone*...  kite: where's hart.. tell me *right now*..  guh. we're conducting a search. dextra and nistro are trying to retrieve  kite : have you two found hart yet. well. *have* you.  nistro : i told the control team to keep this mission *quiet*. so how did kite find out. kite : do you read me. nistro, come in.  dextra, nistro, come in. *do you read me*. why aren't you answering.  nistro: because you're annoying, *that's* why.  dextra: don't cut him off yet.  *calm down*, kite. we can confirm that your brother is safe. nistro: but dextra  dextra : listen. we're supposed to bring hart back. and it *won't* be easy. we'll need your help, kite. your brother was detected on the roof of the windmill tower located in the bay area. dextra: he's with a boy named yuma tsukumo. kite : hm.  nistro: ugh. are you *kidding*.. *we're* supposed to handle this. *why bring in kite*.. dextra: because we can't *do* this *without* him.   dextra : hart is too powerful in his current state.  dextra : last time we tried to nab him, the results were *explosive*.  dextra: kite is the *only person i know* who that boy will trust right now. i believe hart will listen to kite and obey what he says.   kite : *why is hart at that tower*..   fb kite: here.  fb kite: it's caramel. it's a tasty, magical powerup. it can give you strength.  fb hart: it's sweet. it's *really* sweet. i feel energetic. fb kite: that's good. ... i will *always* protect you.  fb kite: rrrrgghh. stop it.. let me go, you.. *hart*...  fb kite: let 'im go..   kite : he must've been drawn to that place. but *why go with yuma*.  kite : i want answers, and i'll stop at *nothing* to get them.  act 1 <<3:21  yuma: well that was certainly a *weird goodbye*.  fb quentin: i'm hart's friend. i'm here to help. *isn't that right, hart.*  yuma: but hart did seem to *know* the guy, so i guess it'll be okay. tori: hmm. he'll be *fine*. i guess kite was too busy to pick hart up, so he sent a friend. yuma: *maybe*...  but i feel like i don't *understand* anything about hart. kite once told me he hunts for numbers to help his little brother, but why.   fb hart : my mission is to destroy astralworld.  astral : could it be true....  yuma: yaah. who is it *now*..  act 2 <<4:19  tori: isn't that the chopper that took hart away..  yuma: it's *you again*.  nistro: okay, kidyuma: yyaaahh. nistro: *where is hart*.. yuma: whaddaya mean. your guys took him away a few minutes ago. nistro: *who* took him.. yuma: somebody with a chopper just like yours.  yuma: aren't you guys all working for the same team..  yuma: the chopper that picked up hart had a symbol like that, too.  nistro: didja hear that, dextra..  tori: yuma. dextra: yeah. i don't believe a *word that he says*. we're the only ones looking for hart. nistro : *stop lying to us* or else. *what have you done with hart*.. rrrgghh.  tori: leave him alone.  yuma: ugh. *put me down*, nistro. dextra: *can it*, kid. don't forget, we're on the duel carnival's organizing committee. all it takes is *one word from us*, and you'll be booted out of the competition.  yuma: *i know*.  nistro: then we want a straight answer from you. *what have you done with hart*. tori: hey. what's that.  orbital: ninice landing, sir.  kite: all right. tell me where hart is. is my brother okay. well.. yuma: kite. i tried to tell them. but they think i'm hiding hart so they won't listen to *anything i say*. kite: *are* you hiding him, yuma. yuma: no way. the guy you sent came in a chopper to pick up your brother.  kite: i didn't send *anyone* to pick him up.  yuma: then he wasn't... *your* friend.   hart: brother....   yuma: if kite *didn't* send that guy to pick up hart... then... where did he come from. orbital: stop ttrying to fool us, we weren't *manufactured yesterday*, ya know. kite: *be quiet*.  orbital: i'm just saying, master kite. kite: describe the person who picked up hart. tell me *everything*. you said *guy*. i assume the person was male. yuma: yeah, of course.  nistro: what'd he look like.. tori: well, he seemed pretty young. i think about twenty years old. he was tall... astral: approximate height six feet  astral: one inch. weight astral: one hundred fifty pounds.  yuma: yeah. right. uh, he guy was about sixone, and, and weighed one fifty. astral: he had long hair, and his eyes were the color blue. yuma: he had long hair, and his eyeswwhat color didja say they were again.  nistro: rrgh, you're askin' for it, twerp. kite: *stop it*, nistro. nistro: or what.. i don't take orders from you. and adextra: *nistro*. nistro: but dextrathis kid's makin' up enough junk to fill a *garbage dump*. dextra: it *is* hard to believe. but it seems clear that someone outside of our team came here and took hart away.  dextra: let's go, nistro. there's nothing more we can do for now. nistro: mmgghhall right, then.  yuma: yaaahh.. ugh. tori: you okay..  nistro : this whole mission was a *big waste a' time*...  yuma: it's *my* fault. i shouldn't have let hart go. i'm sorry.  kite: hart isn't well. i hope i find him soon.  tori : hart's sick.  yuma: kite. hold on. it's *my* fault that hart is missing. i'll help you find him.  kite: this is my problem, not yours. yuma: *no*, kitei made a *promise* to hart. that i'd bring you both back together.  kite: give 'im the contact code. orbital: aaffirmative. if you *airheads* find him, *this* is how to reach us.  yuma: good luck, kite.  tori: how *awful*. hart's sick and we turned him over to a stranger. yuma : it's all so confusing.  fb yuma: why d'you even *hunt* numbers anyway.. well.. answer me.  fb kite: i do it, because it's the only way i can save my little brother.  yuma: kite is hunting numbers to save hart. is he hoping to *cure* him, somehow.  yuma: maybesomeone *else* has promised to cure him. agh, i wish we knew the truth. astral: perhaps we have a clue. i am curious why *dextra and nistro* were searching for hart. yuma: huh. astral: they were very anxious to recover the boy, as if they wanted to avoid getting into trouble.  astral : perhaps they *lost* hart, and they were trying to retrieve him before their *superior* found out.  astral : once they got the boy from *you*, they planned to take him back.  yuma: back *where*. astral: they not only sit on the carnival's organizing committee, but they are enforcers for the carnival's chief, mister heartland. yuma: but, if they're working for mister heartland... astral: then the most likely explanation is that they were trying to return *hart* to mister heartland. hart must've been under heartland's custody when he escaped. yuma: and if that's true... then it's possible... that in order to cure his little brother, kite is being forced to collect *numbers* for mister heartland. and so the person *behind it all*astral: ...must be mister heartland.  yuma: dah... aaahh.  yuma: rrrggghhh..  yuma: wait, the person who took hart away *wasn't* working for mister heartland. astral: correct. there must be*another* powerful figure who wants to have control of hart. yuma: someone else. who *is* it.  vetrix: good. we can start the ritual now. act 3 <<10:50  kite : hart, can you hear me. where *are* you. answer me.   kite : please, little brother...   kite : *hart*.  fb kite: hart. come out, come out, wherever you are.  fb kite : found you.  fb hart: you win, kite. like you always do.  fb hart: you're really good at hideandseek. it doesn't matter where i try to hide, you can *always find me*.   kite : i *always* find you, hart.  i'll find you *this time*, too. just *call out*.  call out to me..  vetrix : finally, the moment has come. i will drain hart's power from him and make it mine.  vetrix : my plan for revenge can at long last be fulfilled. with my new power doctor faker will have *no chance*.   vetrix : heheheheh, yes, i can *sense it*.  vetrix : it's *so beautiful*. *this must be astralworld*..  vetrix : hart's power truly is great..  hart: bigugh....  hart: stop. please. uuuaaaggghhh.....  hart: no, youyou *can't*. ugh. *please*.. uuugghh...   vetrix : hahahahaha. the potential is truly awesome.. i'll be even stronger than i dared dream.  vetrix : i will be *allpowerful*..  hart: ugh. help me...  hart : brother.. kite: he's calling me. that's hart.  yuma: what's going on, astral. why'd'ja stop. astral: hart is... in trouble... yuma: what *kind* of trouble. tori: d'ya think he's in some kind of *danger*.  hart : ugh. save me, big brother.  hart : kite. hurry. *please*.....   astral: hart needs help, right away. he is quite desperate.  hart: aaaaggggghhhhh.... vetrix: your power is truly incredible. it's a shame i can't let you *keep* some of it, but unfortunately i must have *all of it* for myself.  hart: brotheri need you. gghh. hurry, kiiiiiiiite...  kite: i'm here, hart.  hart: brother....  kite: how can i find you.. tell me..  hart: kite....  kite: hart, where *are you*..  hart: look... for... the moon in the water... and... the white... castle....  kite: moon in water. a white castle....  kite: i'm on my way, hart.. yuma: so hart doesn't know the name of the place. astral: no. but he *described* it. it must be near water... and looks like a *white castle*. yuma: there's a lotta *water* around here, but no castles. where could this place *be*.  tori: hmmm...  tori: hey, it might be, that abandoned museum just outside of the city. yuma: yeah, it *could* be.  tori: look here.  tori: it *does* look sorta like a castle. yuma: yeah, you're right, tori. tori: *and* there's a pond on the property. so that could be where hart saw the reflection of the moon.  yuma: that must be the place. let's move it. there's no time to lose.  yuma: kite, come in. kite.   yuma: that's where they're holding hart. tori: i hope he's all right.  yuma: kite. hart's locked away in that old museum. kite: how can you be sure of that, yuma. yuma: ah, i just *know*, okay. kite: it's *not okay*. there's no room for error. my brother's not well.  hart: i need help, kite, please hurry...  astral: our time is running out. yuma: ugh. listen, kitewe have to come up with a rescue plan, quickly.  quentin: how did they find us *so fast*.  quatro: who knows. maybe someone *tipped them off*, or maybe kite *followed* you here, quentin. quentin: impossible. quatro: well. since they're here, it would be *rude* not to say hello. and then *bid them goodbye*. i'll be back.  quentin: don't push your luck, quatro.  quatro: d'you think those *losers* are too tough for me to handle. quentin: don't underestimate kite. he is a powerful duelist.  quentin: it's only necessary for you to *delay* them, until vetrix has completed the ritual.  quatro: mmph. once i start dueling there's *no guarantee*. i may not be *able* to hold back.  quentin: trey.  keep him *reined in*. trey : i will. you can count on me.  astral: it seems that hart's captors are inviting us in. yuma: then let's accept their invitation, and go at 'em deck to deck.  yuma: huh. kite: i'm going in alone. yuma: bad idea. you don't even know who's waiting in there. besides, i got hart into this mess, and i wanna help get 'im out. no matter what you say, i'm gonna be part a' this rescue, too. so what're we waitin' for, come on.  act 4 <<17:31  yuma: the place looks empty, guys. where could hart *be*. kite: he's *gotta be here somewhere*.  tori: huh..  quatro: heh.  quatro: if it isn't the *infamous kite*. what an *honor*.  yuma: hey, it's *quatro*. kite: you've *met before*. yuma: we have.   tori: quatro.... ah.... quatro: i'll be happy to duel you, *too*, twerp. you'll suffer the same fate as your friends. yuma: rrrgghhh.  astral: do not give in to your anger, yuma. if you duel for revenge, you will *never* defeat him. yuma: don't worry. i understand there's something a *lot bigger* at stake. kite: are *you* the ones who took my brother. where *is he*.. quatro: relax. no harm has come to him. at least not *yet*. kite: what's that mean.. quatro: when we're finished we'll turn hart back over to *you*. well, what's *left* of him.  quatro: heheheheh, if you wanna *save the kid*, then you don't have *any choice*.  quatro: you'll have to get past *us*, first. astral: this will be...  astral: a tagteam duel. yuma: excellent. bring it on. hyah.  kite: i'll crush you creeps and get my brother *out of here*..  quatro: hart isn't going *anywhere* yet. huah..  quatro: huhuhuhahaha.  yuma: duel gazer, let's roll.  kite: it's *on*. your souls will be mine.  computer:
