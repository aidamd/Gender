'cause that's what this is about. someone's been ripping off jewelry stores. i got some security footage from a source. but it's *so blurry*. can you make anything out of it.  yuma: huh....  yuma: no way.  yuma : is that... *lillybot*.. kari: i'm *tellin'* you, whoever's behind this is *good*. there's not a duel security system *out there* that this mystery person *can't* take down. astral: that is because it is *not* a person. perhaps this is why lillybot is so good at duelingshe was *programmed* to be.  astral: the question is, programmed by whom. and i think *that* is a question we might be able to answer using *simple logic*. <10:00> since the thief seems to disappear after each heist, that meansyuma: that means *what*. astral: that means he needs someplace to disappear *to*. someplace *close*.  astral: close to all of the jewelry stores he has robbed so far... like *this* little hideaway right here.  yuma: so let's roll.  kari: *hey*. thanks a lot for the *help*.  robber: tonight's been the best hall yet. heheheheh.  robber: but since no one's smart enough to figure out my scheme, i'm sure it'll only get betteryuma: hold it right there.  robber : aheheh, hey, who're you. yuma: *me*.. i'm lillybot's bff, that's who *i* am. robber: who's lillybot.  robber: you talkin' about *her*.  robber: sorry, but these bots're mine, so get lost. yuma: no way. litterbots aren't something you *own*. so, *let her go*, right now.. <11:00>  robber: heh, *okayyy*,  *get 'im*.  yuma: hey, lillybot...  yuma: don't you remember me. it's yuma.  yuma: lillybot.  yuma: lillybot. aaahhh.  yuma: what's with you.. bronk: no kidding. so much for the whole 'best friends forever' thing. tori: what *now*. yuma: rrggh. now we duel. let's go. lillybot:  duel accepted. target confirmed. prepare to be eradicated. astral: and, *why exactly* did you challenge lilly to a duel. yuma: *this* is why.  yuma: she left this card behind... and *with it*, i'll bring her back. or if that doesn't work, go down trying. act 3 <11:49>  computer: augmented reality vision link established. yuma and lillybot: let's duel. bronk: game time. <12:00> yuma : hope you're ready, lilly, 'cause i'm drawin'. first i summon gagaga magician.   yuma: next i'll place one card facedown and end my turn. lillybot: initiating protocol threez. draw. first i activate "eco spell reduce waste".  lillybot: with this card, by banishing two junk robot monsters in my deck, i can add junk robot camelcycle to my hand. i now summon camelcycle.  lillybot: i then activate "eco spell recycle". with this card, i can summon the two junk robot monsters that were banished earlier. i now summon junk robot cleanaga.   lillybot: and junk robot computerkong.   yuma: it's goin' ape. lillybot: i now overlay these three levelfour junk robots, and by way of this overlay, an overlay network has been created.  lillybot: and with it, i will now xyz summon recycle rhinobot. <13:00>   yuma: rrrgghh... lillybot: initiating protocol thirtythree f. rhinobot attacks gagaga magician. astral: yuma. yuma: *i know*. i play the trap, "half unbreak". now my monster is spared, and i only take half the damage.  yuma: ggghh.  tori: keep fighting, yuma. you're lilly's one and only chance.  yuma: yeahi wish someone would tell *her* that. here goes. draw. and nowi'll *play* my draw. rise up, gagaga girl.   yuma: next up, is "wonder wand", so gagaga girl gains five hundred extra attack points.  astral: nice move. now it is time to take it to the *next* level. yuma: no doubt. now i play my magician's ability. <14:00> its level changes from four to eight, until the end of my turn. astral: really, yuma. butyuma: then i activate the spell card, "gagagathunder".  yuma: but don't look to the *sky* when ya hear the boomlook to your lifepoints, 'cause you take damage equal to the difference between my monsters' levels times three hundred.  yuma: and in case your *software* isn't up to date, i'll do the math for yathe difference is *five*, so you take fifteen hundred points of damage.  yuma: i then place one card facedown and end my turn.  yuma: now that my turn's over, gagaga magician's level changes back from eight, to four. astral: yumai tried to tell you. gagaga girl has an ability that would've changed lilly's xyz monster's attack points to zero.  astral: if you'd changed your magician's level to gagaga girl's, and xyz summoned leviathan dragon, you could've attacked rhinobot, and *you would've won*. <15:00> yuma: ... not until i play lilly's card.  yuma: your turn, lilly. lillybot: initiating protocol two xdraw. first i summon, junk robot teapot kangaroo.  lillybot: i now activate rhinobot's ability. for every overlay unit i use, a different monster on my field other than rhinobot gains five hundred additional attack points. yuma: not good. lillybot: i use three overlay units. so teapot kangaroo now gains fifteen hundred attack points.  bronk: that is *one mean marsupial*. lillybot: first, i will have rhinobot attack gagaga girl. yuma: i activate the trap card "gagagaguard". now since there are two gagaga monsters on the field, gagaga girl can't be destroyed this battle.  lillybot: protocol fortyone a. teapot kangaroo attacks gagaga magician. yuma: *no good*, lilly. gagagaguard protects *him* too.  <16:00> lillybot: perhaps, but not you.  yuma: aaaaaaaahhhh. tori: oh no.  astral: yuma, your lifepoints cannot take too much more of this.  yuma: uuugghhh... i know it. but i have to hold on 'til i can play lilly's card. it's our only chance, astral. ya see, if lilly sees that old card, maybe she'll go back to her old self, too. lillybot: *old... ssself...* yuma: that's right, lilly. just think back. lillybot: iiii... iiiii... i activate rhinobot's ability. when rhinobot does not have any overlay units, my monster with the least amount of attack points is destroyed.  lillybot: as a result, we both take damage equal to the destroyed monster's original attack points.  yuma: errgghhh. astral: yuma, when that special ability activates again next turn, both you *and lilly* will run out of lifepoints. <17:00> yuma: well, in *that* casei'd better hope for the perfect draw.  robber: heheheheh... well done, there, bot. now to make sure those *meddling kids* meddle no more.  yuma: what... was that. lillybot: selfdestruct program initiated. countdown set at one minute.  lillybot: selfdestruct program initiated. selfdestruct program initiated.  act 4 <17:30> lillybot: selfdestruct program initiated. countdown set at one minute.  lillybot: selfdestruct program initiated. selfdestruct program initiated.  yuma: what's that supposeta mean. lillybot's gonna *explode*. astral: that is correct, yuma. you need to *stop that countdown* before it reaches zero. yuma: but how. astral: how else. just stick with your plan and duel lilly's memory back. yuma: then it all comes down to this.  <18:00> yuma: time to feel the flow.. draw.  yuma: it's here. i activate the spell card "star light, star bright" from my hand. lillybot: what is this.. yuma: it's a spell card that lets me match gagaga girl's level to gagaga magician.   lillybot: memory banks overriding operational protocol.  lillybot: override. override. override.   lillybot: yuma stinks. yuuma stinks. yuma stinks. yuuma stinks. yuma: look. it's working. she's coming back. tori: she *really is*. bronk: don't stop. keep on yellin' that 'yuma stinks', lillybot, just like ya did in the good ol' days, remember. lillybot: yuma stinks. yuma stinks.  lillybot: yuma stinks. operational protocol has been successfully overridden...  yuma: she's*back*.. lillybot: ...therefore failsafe systems are now enacted..  <19:00> tori: no she's not. yuma: rrrgghh... astral: there are just *twenty seconds remaining*, yuma. yuma: yeah. then i better put 'em to good use. i now overlay level four gagaga magician and gagaga girl.  yuma: with these two monsters, i build the overlay network and xyz summonnumber thirtynine, utopia.    bronk: the time.. tori: hurry, yuma. yuma: next i play gagaga girl's ability. since i used gagaga girl *and* gagaga magician to xyz summon, your monster's attack points become *zero*.  yuma: jogging your memory didn't *work*, lilly, so nowlet's try *knocking* some sense back into you.  <20:00> yuma: go, rising sun slash.  yuma: lillybot.  lillybot: ... yuma, you stink. yuma, you stink.  bronk : *that's* my girl. she's back. tori : yay. you did it.  robber: blast. that *disobedient bot*...  bot: do not fret. robber: hah.  bot: we will carry out lilly's mission. robber: uhh... uaaagghh. bot: five... four... three... two...  robber: get *lost*, ya chrome buckets. bot: one...   reporter : last night when police responded to an explosion, a man was arrested after discovery kari: that was *my* story..  kari: if i find out who scooped me they're *toast*.. ugh...  yuma: see ya later, you two.  lillybot: yuma, do not forget your duel fuel, catch.  yuma: ah. thanks, lilly. anything else i forgot. lillybot: just one thingyou stink. you stink. you stink. yuma: whoa.  lillybot: you stink. you stink. you stink. yuma: *hey*.. i don't *stink*. i just took a shower. lillybot: you stink. you stink. you stink. yuma: okay, maybe i didn't use soap, but *still*. end <21:20> * special thanks to animeratio.com for the
