 kite : little brother, there's been a complication.  kite : a kid named *yuma* has partnered up with the envoy from astralworld.  kite : like me, they've been gathering numbers. but i promise you, i *will* take care of them.  act 1 <1:19>  yuma: gaaah.. late.  kari: *hang on* a second, yuma.  yuma: i don't *have* a second. i'm gonna be *way late*. kari: the clothes you dumped on the floor when you came home last night smelled like *smoked fish*. and *this morning*, i read,  there was an explosion at a warehouse down in the pier district.  kari: you weren't *down there* last nightwere you.. yuma: of course i wasn't. can i please go to school now. i don't wanna be late. kari: *they're* saying it was an electrical fire. but this has 'coverup' written *all over it*. heart land enterprises owns that building *and* big media, soyuma : yeah, well, that's really cool. gotta go, catchya later. kari: *yuma*.....  litterbots: trash identified. trash identified. <2:00>  astral: your sister is quite intuitive.  yuma: gaah. astral: she will eventually find out what you are involved in.  yuma: what matters to me is that my key is safe, and we got shark's soul back. oh, and i'm glad *you're okay, too. astral: hmph. i must admit, i am still feeling a bit shaken.  astral : the fact that kite has the power to enter your key is *most concerning*...  yuma: yeah. he's full a' surprises.  yuma : it's like every time i think i'm starting to figure 'im out, he throws a *curveball*. who *is* he..   yuma: race ya.  yuma: we're clearly still in the dark when it comes to *who kite is*. astral: but we *did* learn something new during that last duel. he cannot be controlled by the power of the number cards.  astral : up until now, the duelists we have faced who were using number cards were being *controlled* by the cards.  astral : the numbers had taken them over, and were making them *act strangely*, <3:00> or against their wills. but that does not seem to be the case with kite. he seems to be *perfectly in control*. it is very possible...  astral: ...that kite is in possession of a power that is *not of this world*.  yuma: whoa. what *kinda* power.. astral: i do not know.  astral : but the galaxyeyes photon dragon that he uses... the light that lives inside that monster triggers a strange feeling inside me.  astral : it makes me wonder if that dragon comes from a different world.  yuma: it might help if we knew *how* collecting number cards helps him. how're *your memories* supposed to save his little brother. astral: perhaps they *cannot* save him... perhaps this is just about stopping *me*. yuma: stopping *you*. astral: suppose that upon regaining my memories, i will discover something that threatens his plans. we do not know what situation his brother is in.  astral : what if me regaining my memories... is what puts his little brother in danger.  yuma: so *you're* saying, <4:00> kite gathering the numbers might be not be about making something *happen*, it might be about making sure that something *doesn't* happen. dyaaaahh.. ah, what'm i doing, i'm *late*...   yuma: what's up, tori. tori : we're *late*. that's what's up.  yuma: man. they make these classes *too early*.  tori: ya know, this is *your* fault, yuma. with everything that happened last night at the warehouse, the duel, the explosioni was up half the night *worrying* about you. yuma: uh... tori: because of that, i slept through my alarm. and by *you*, i mean *both* of you. i was really worried about astral, too.  tori: hey. you *hear that*, astral..  ohh... because of *you two*, i'm gonna get detention.  yuma: it's gonna be okay, i promise. tori : welli'm just glad *you're* okay now, astral. yuma: he's over *here*, actually...  tori: whatever. he can *hear me*, *right*. bronk: yuma. tori. <5:00>  yuma: hey, guys. welcome to the *tardiness club*. bronk: aw, man, that *warehouse* last night *sure was dangerous*. i was shakin' so much when i got home i couldn't sleep. kazwell: neither could i. but in the end, i'm glad we were able to be there for you.  yuma: thanks for yesterday, you guys.  cathy: you're welcome. yuma: whoa. hey, didn't see ya there. cathy: 's okay. no one *ever* does. yuma: oh. sorry, cat. flip: heard ya had an *adventure* yesterday. everybody else: flip. flip: and why wasn't *i* invited. yuma: iit's not like we *planned it* or anything...  everyone: huh.  yuma: that's the second bell. we've gotta go.. flip: i can't miss history again..   yuma: what's this.  yuma: uh... guys. whawhat's goin' on. <6:00>  yuma: uh... why aren't they moving. astral: because. time seems to have stopped. yuma: is this *kite's* doing. astral: no... this is something else. act 2 <6:13>  mr. heartland : doctor faker. what's going on..  dr. faker : two electromagnetic surgesone from astralworld, one from another world*collided* right on top of earth. because of the energy generated in that collision, time has temporarily stopped. mr. heartland : how can time just *stop*. dr. faker : these things happen, heartland. in a matter of hours, the collisional aftershocks will ripple away, and everything will return to normal. but there could be no mistakethat the *two worlds* are drawing closer to one another.  dr. faker : we're running out of time. we *must deal with astralworld*.. astral: yumalook. yuma: this can't be happening.  yuma: *why are there three suns in the sky..* <7:00> ugh, this day is getting *freakier and freakier*... astral: i *know* one of those suns. i believe it shines on *my* world.  astral: ahh....  kite : i hope you're right about this, orbital seven. this could prove *most useful*...  kite: now you're *sure* this is where they met. orbital: i am. every action they've tataken leaves a *footprint* on the fabric of titime and space. with this unexpected phenomenon occurring, we cacan now *see* those footprints.  orbital: their journey ttogether started right here.  orbital : yuma was dueling the young human male named shark.  fb shark: didja really think you could *beat* me, the best a' the best, and win bronk's deck back.. fb yuma : yeah. i kinda *did*. i guess i was wrong.  fb shark: face it, yumai stomped your little key to pieces, and now, i'm gonna stomp *you*.. fb yuma: that's where you're wrong, shark.

esper star sparrow: aaaaaggghhh.   astral: yuma, do you recall the duel we lost with shark. yuma: yeah. i was trying to get 'im to stop hanging out with scorch and chills. astral: that is right. after

volcasaurus.  fb shark: your partners outta the picture, and you got no monsters to hide behind. fb yuma: i think its safe to say that youre about to get officially *yumad*. cause by sending utopia to the graveyard...  fb yuma: black ray lancer can charge in again and attack you directly. fb scorch: whaa.. no way.  fb yuma: go, shimmering spear slaaaash...  yuma : and then after *that* duel... yuma: a few days later, that's when we first dueled kite right here.  astral: yes... <15:00> and we were *far from prepared*.  yuma : that's *one* way to put it. he wiped the *floor* with us. fb kite:
