  act 1 <2:14>  fortuno: ha ha ha.  fortuno: i see the end. you're *kneeling* before me. hahahaha.  fortuno: you're admitting defeat, and you're *begging me* to release your *little friends*.  yuma: rrgghh...  yuma: bronk... tori...  tori: yuma...  yuma: don't worry, guys. i can do this.  cathy: come on... you gotta win.  astral: this feeling i have... like i *cannot move*... i felt it for the first time during our duel with kite. i now understand that i am...  astral : *afraid*.   astral : this is *fear* i am feeling. so if this is being *afraid*, how do i make it *stop*. <3:00> yuma : astral. hey*astral*..  yuma: quit your *daydreamin'*. in case ya haven't noticed, we're *dueling*. astral: i knowbut you have no monster cards in your hand.  astral: and due to shock master's special ability, you cannot use traps. if you do not pull a monster card on this *next draw*it is over. yuma: so, then.. all i gotta do is draw a monster.. here we goi draw.  yuma: all right. but... ahh. it's *kurivolt*, and it's only got three hundred attack points. astral : we can use it.... listenyou *must summon that monster*. yuma: buthe can't really *do anything*. astral : get it on the field, you *must trust me*.  yuma: all right... i summon kurivolt.   astral: good work. now your kurivolt can use any overlay units in play <4:00> so that it can summon *more* kurivolt tokens to join it on your field. right now the only monster with overlay units, is shock master. yuma: i see what you're saying. with kurivolt's special abilityi can steal shock master's two overlay units, to summon two kurivolt tokens on my field.  yuma: gotcha.  yuma: awww, yeah. i got *three* on my field now for the price of one. fortuno: ah. but why rely on such *miserable creatures*. why not summon something... *stronger*. *i* see... you hold no other monsters in your hand..  fortuno: you had no *choice* but to rely on those pitiful creatures, *did* you.  yuma: ugghhh.... astral: do not panic, yuma. use voltage summon. yuma: okay. i'm activating the "voltage summon" spell card. <5:00>  yuma: so *why* did i do that. astral: because it allows you to exchange each one of your kurivolt tokens with any monster from your deck that's levelfour or below. yuma: oh yeah. i tribute two kurivolt tokens and in their place, i summon ganbara knight and kagetokage from my deck.. the downside is that voltage summon leaves these two with no attack points and no defense points.   yuma: *but*that's no biggie because it's *overlay time*..  yuma: with these two monsters, i build the overlay network and xyz summonnumber thirtynine, utopia.  astral : he was presented with an overwhelming situation, and yet, he was able to shake his fear and move forward... i must ask him to teach me how to do that. fortuno: hmhmhmhmhmhm. <6:00> so *that's* the number card i'll be taking. yuma: you *wish*. go, utopiaattack shock master. rising sun slash.  yuma: not only did i just *mop the floor* with your numberi've still got an attack left. and since your field is wideopen, kurivolt can attack you directly.   yuma: just hang on, you guys. i'm gonna get you outta there. it's *your move*, sideshow. astral: yuma, waitplace the traps in your hand. yuma: uh. astral: you cannot activate them yet, but, *have them ready*. yuma: oh, yeahexcellent point. i place two cards facedown and end my turn.  astral : all is not lost. we *may have a chance*. <7:00>  fortuno: hmhmhmhmhmhmhmhmhmhm, hahahahahahahahaha. yuma: what. what're you laughing at, freak show. fortuno: i'm laughing at *you*, and the fact that you *still* believe you have a chance. it's *my turn*. i draw. first things first... from my hand i summon rainbow shaman.  fortuno: i should *thank you*, boy. by summoning an xyz monster and using it to clear my field, *you* enabled me to call this monster forth.  yuma : yeah, well*you're welcome*. astral: *zero attack points*. fortuno: i activate the "xyz plant" spell card. and with it, i can choose a monster and then my plant transforms into a monster with the same level. so now i have *two* rainbow shaman on my field. hahahaha.  yuma: you turned a spell card into a monster.. astral: no.... fortuno: and with that done i now *overlay* xyz plant and rainbow shaman. <8:00>  fortuno: with these two monsters i build the overlay network. i xyz summon, number eleven, big eye..   yuma: another number.. you have *got* to be kidding me... astral: *and* it is powerful. fortuno: ha hahahahahahaha.  fortuno: did you really think that i only had *one number card* at my disposal. naive fool. i have collected *dozens* of number cards for my master kite.  fortuno: hahahahahahaha. act 2 <8:42> flip: can yumareally *defeat* this guy. kazwell: i *really don't think so*... fortuno: hmhmhmhmhmhm, hahahahaha. yuma: ugh... astral: try to stay focused. you still have utopia. yuma: right. so we're all good. <9:00> utopia can negate an attack by using an overlay unit. so no matter how powerful the monster, the attack won't get through.. fortuno: hmhmhmhmhmhm. *except*, that i'm about to activate big eye's special ability. by using one overlay unit, big eye can seize control of one of *your* monsters. i'm afraid your *precious utopia* will now become *my little puppet*. yuma: ahh, *no*. fortuno: big eye, seize his monster. go, temptation glance.  yuma: utopia.. astral: this changes the situation. without our number... fortuno: utopia, you will do my bidding. attack kurivolt now.  yuma: waah. astral: ugh...   tori: ohhh..... kazwell: we're all gonna fall.. flip: save us yumaaa... fortuno: your fate will be delayed a bit more. for big eye cannot attack on the turn it uses an xyz special ability.  fortuno : so for now... fortuno: i place a facedown and end my turn. yuma: ugghhh....  yuma: ugh. my turn. i draw.  yuma : sweet. now i can summon a monster. fortuno: hmhmhmhmhmhmhmhm. dear boy, you haven't gone and forgotten that i can see all your cards, now, have you. yuma: what.. fortuno: you just drewa *monster card*. so it's the perfect time for me to activate my "freezing dance" trap card.  fortuno: heheheheh, beginning now...  fortuno : for the next two turns *neither* of us can summon a monster. flip: without a monster, yuma's just *big eye bait* waiting to be obliterated. <11:00> tori: maybe... yuma: ugh... i guess i have to *end my turn*. fortuno: how unfortunate...  *truly*.  fortuno: hmhmhmhm. the end is near, *boy*. tumble into the depths of oblivion, along with your little friends.. big eye, attack him directly. astral: yuma, the trap card. yuma: oh, yeah, right. i can use traps again *starting this turn*. i'm still in this. i activate, "nitwit outwit". by sending a monster card in my hand to my graveyard,  it reduces the damage that i take, equal to my monster's attack points.  yuma: dododo warrior. i need your help.  yuma: aaauugghh.  fortuno: heheheheheheh, if you think you've managed to somehow avoid defeat, *think again*.. utopia, attack. astral: now would be a good time to play the *other* trap. yuma: right. i activate the "xyz weight" trap card. now an xyz monster loses eight hundred attack points for *every one of its overlay units.  yuma: aaaahhh. cathy: ahh.. tori: oh, no....  astral: ah....  bronk: gotcha. tori: ohh.... aaahhhh....  fortuno: it's impressive that you were able to survive *two* direct attacks. but now i've got a *surprise* for you. the "twilight dance" spell card. this spell prevents both of us from summoning monsters from our graveyards.  fortuno: eheheheheheheheh... you're all out of options *now*, boy. tori: come on....  <13:00> fortuno: *your* field is empty, and i have two powerful monsters ready to do my bidding. you cannot resist anymore. you don't need a *fortuneteller* to tell you that you have *no chance*.. hahahahahahaha. *your move*.  astral: this is... *the end*.  yuma: ugh... i'm sorry.  fortuno: there *is* a way for you to save them. it's the *only* way. yuma: hunh. fortuno: surrender this duel, yuma. accept defeat. and relinquish your number card to me and my master kite. if you do so, then i will let your little friends *go*. yuma: seriously. fortuno: it's a *good deal* you're being offered here. if you give up *one* little lamb, you'll be able to save the *entire flock*. <14:00> hmhmhmhm.  flip: mmmggh, i *can't look*... bronk: *yuma*... tori: don't do it. *don't do it*, yuma..  cathy: no.... fortuno: hmhmhmhmhahahahaha. why would you even *hesitate*. *clearly* it's the best choice.  astral: i *told* you that we should not have come here... we have no chance of defeating him. to keep dueling would be to doom your friends.  astral: there is only one thing we can do now, yuma... we have lost. hand over the number card. yuma: butif i surrender the duel, then you'll*vanish*. act 3 <14:54> astral: you have to surrender your number card, yuma. in order to save your friends. <15:00> you *have to*.  yuma: ugh. there's *gotta be another way*, astral.. astral: there is not. yuma: my friends have always been there when i needed them.  yuma : good times and bad times... yuma: ups and downs... through thick and thin. i'm not just gonna *ditch my friends*.  astral: i know. that is why i am saying, youyuma: still don't *get it*, do you. i said i *won't abandon any of my friends*, astral. and*you're* my friend..   yuma : if i surrender this duel, then it's *lightsout* for you. tori: can that be true. astral: yuma... fortuno: welllll.. stop *muttering to yourself* over there and tell me your decision.. yuma: you really think i'm just gonna call it quits and give you my number card.. guess you can't see the future after all. fortuno: ah. in *that* case, master kite is looking forward to watching *me win* and adding *your soul* to his collection. <16:00> ahahahahahahaha. yuma: rrrgghh...  yuma: what's *with* that, kite.. you're making peons do your *dirty work* now..  yuma: what's wrong. *too chicken* to duel me yourself.. uhhh... hey. how do i know it's really *kite* sitting up there..  fortuno: itwhat're you saying.. of *course* it's kite. cathy: oh yeah. let's *see*.  cathy: *cat's*about to *pounce*..  yuma: a fake..  astral: so then... that was *not kite*. fortuno: what have you.. do you realize what you've done.. yuma: ahaha. i *knew* something didn't seem right.  yuma : i dueled kite once. he seemed like more of the 'lone wolf' type, not the type who relies on *minions and underlings* to get things done.  <17:00> yuma: you don't even *know him*, *do you*.. you *phony*..  fortuno: mmmmm.  astral: i was afraid of something that was not even there. yuma: heh. i was kinda freakin' out, too. but then sometimes you just gotta step up and *feel the flow*. know what i mean, buddy. astral: yes, i do...  astral : i realize now, fear is not the only emotion i've grown to understand.  astral : watching yuma confront obstacles and rise up to meet challenges...  astral : i think i also have learned what it means to... *hope*.    yuma: huh. aaaaaahhhh.  yuma: whoa.. fortuno: what*is that*.   flip and kazwell: ahhhh... tori: look, guys. is that... astral.  act 4 <18:00>  bronk: whoais that *astral*.  astral: yumawin this. yuma: you got it, pal. get readyit's my turn. i draw.  yuma : the "comeback." spell card. astral: use it, yuma. and get utopia back. yuma: on it. first up, i'm activating the spell card, "comeback." with *this* bad boy, i can regain control of a monster on your field.  yuma: utopia, come back. fortuno: no....  astral: and now we can achieve victory.  astral: the path has been made. yuma: path.. for what.  astral: for thischaos number thirtynine. yuma: *chaos* number..  astral: by combining utopia with its overlay units, utopia can further evolve itself. the time is now, yuma. yuma and astral : go. chaos xyz evolution..  yuma and astral : get ready for chaos number thirtynine. i give youutopia ray.  bronk: where did all *this* awesomeness come from.. tori: yeah. fortuno : i did not see this transpiring. neverthelessmy big eye is more powerful. yuma and astral : not when utopia ray's special ability activates. by using an overlay unit, it gains five hundred attack points.  yuma and astral : right now utopia ray has *three* overlay units, which are *all* about to be used.  yuma and astral : go, overlay charge. fortuno: no, no. yuma and astral : and, for every overlay unit, your monster loses one thousand attack points.  fortuno: that means.. yuma: it sure does. do ityuma and astral : utopia ray. attack big eye.  yuma and astral : rising sun chaos slash..    yuma: hey, you guys. tori: he sure is *amazing*.  bronk, cat, flip, kazwell: yeah, he's incredible. bronk: he saved us. kazwell: stupendous. flip: that was maybe the coolest thing *ever*.  yuma: hey, why are you guys all about *astral* right now. *what about me*..  yuma: ungh. forget iti'm going *home*.  tori: yuma. bronk: i never doubted you for a second astral : observation number thirteen. as long as you have friends... you have hope. subobservation thirteena... *yuma* is my friend.   fortuno: heheheh. that *muttonheaded child* thinks he took *all of my number cards*.  fortuno: *fortunately*, i was wise enough to keep my most *precious* number card here.  fortuno: wha.. itit's *you*..  fortuno: kite.. it's *really you*. masteri've been *watching you*. i think that you're *incredible*. i would give you anything, and everything. kite: good to know. in that case i'll take that *number*. and while we're at it, i'll take your *soul*.    kite: i thank you for your
