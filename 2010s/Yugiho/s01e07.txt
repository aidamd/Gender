yuma: what's *that* supposed to mean. i mean, yeah, sure, i've lost twenty straightso what.. tori : yumalook.  yuma: it's bronk.  tori: oh no. and look who he's dueling. yuma: huh.  yuma: it's *shark*.... shark: i've got you *now* bronk. see, since i've got two monsters on the field and they both have the same level, i can use them to summon an xyz monster.  shark: so watch as i overlay my skull kraken and big jaws to do *just that*.  shark: watch as i unleash a terror of both land *and* sea. watchas i summonaero shark.   bronk: aaahhh.  tori: now *that's* a maneater. yuma: wow. you know why an xyz summon is so cool, tori. <7:00> 'cause the monsters used stick around as overlay units and help activate their new buddy's special powers. it's all about *teamwork*.  yuma: i betcha those litterbots wouldn't call my cards trash... if i had an *xyz* monster.... shark: now, aero shark, dig in on that *chump*.  yuma : oh man, bronk.  bronk: ugghhuughhh... hgghh... shark: thanks for the duel. and for *this*.  yuma: bronk's deck....  not so fast..  shark: who're *you*. yuma: my name is yuma. and i'm bronk's good friend.  buzz off. or don'tcha know who you're messin' with. yuma: sure. i know him. everyone knows the *school bully*.  shark: hmhmhm. i'm no bully. you see, bronk and iwe had an *arrangement*.  shark: it went like this. whoever won, got the other's duel deck. yuma : is that *true*. <8:00>  bronk: it is... but i *had* to do it. he *challenged* me. he called me a *big chicken*.  yuma: fine, thenif you're gonna challenge my friend, then i'm gonna challenge *you*.  *what*. you're outta your mind, you're not even *close* to being in the same league as shark. nah, you're not even in the same *sport*. yuma: so is that a *no*. i guess that means *you're* just a big chicken.  shark: *chicken*.  shark: you know what happened to the last person that called me chicken. yuma: something... uh... *bad*. shark : i don't know, because it's never, *ever* happened before.. yuma: oh... well, then, let *this be the first*.  shark: big *talk*.  shark: all right, yuma, say that we *did* duel. you want bronk's deck back, but what's in it for *me*.  yuma: mph... good question... hadn't thought of that...  shark: mmm.  yuma: hey. that's *mine*. shark: *my*. this *certainly* seems important to you, now *doesn't* it. yuma: *give it*.. shark: settle down. <9:00> since it means *that* much to you, i'll give it *back*.  shark: and duel ya for itwhoooops.  shark: i *dropped* it. hope nothin' *bad* happens to it down there. say, like *this*...  yuma: why did you do that.. shark: th' same reason i'm doin' *this*. guess you're right after all shark: i *am* a bully.  shark: and since we can't duel for *that* anymore, you don't get *this*.  yuma: that's it, you're *toast*. bronk: stop it. shark: you don't give up, do ya.  shark: all right, if you still wanna duel me, guess we could figure *some* sort of arrangement out. if you *beat me*, i'll give back this deck. but if *i* win, yumai get *your* deck.  shark: this sunday. at the station courtyard. if you want bronk's cards back, *be there*.  deep voice: whoever can open this door, <10:00> will gain a great new power. but know, that with such a reward, comes great risk.  deep voice: have you the courage to unlock this power.  echo voice : ...have you the courage...  yuma: i don't even know if i have the *key* to unlock it anymore....  tori: hey, yumayou gonna try and leap those *twenty blocks* again.  yuma: not today.  tori: oh...  yuma. wanna try that underwater lap again. yuma: not really...  tori: heywhat's *wrong* with you today. yuma: i dunno, tori. i... i guess that i'm just not feeling the flow.  yuma: ever since shark broke my key...  yuma: ...things just haven't been the same. tori: yeah...   bronk: yuma. <11:00> tori: huh.  yuma: what's up. bronk: yumathis duel with shark. are you *doin'* it. yuma: well... uh... bronk: *don't go*. yuma: huh. bronk: you can't win, yuma. yuma: whadda you mean by that.. bronk: i *mean*, shark made it all the way to the duel nationals last year. ...look. thanks for tryin' and all... but i'm over this. really.  yuma: but it's not just about you now. bronk: huh. yuma: it's about doing what's *right*. shark's gotta learn, he can't push people around like this. and i'm gonna be the one to *teach 'im*. *so what* if he made it to the nationalsone day *i'm* gonna make it there, too..  bronk: uh... *whatever*. here.  yuma: huh. whoahow did you *find* this. bronk: *duh* bronk: i went *lookin'* for it. later.   <12:00> yuma : maybe those litterbots were right, and my cards *are* trash.  yuma: nothis was my *dad's* deck. and i know he gave it to me for a reason.  yuma: 'bye, grandma.  grandma: wait...  yuma: oh, right, your kiss... grandma: no...  yuma: what's this. grandma: duel fuel. now go take down that bully.  shark: i can't *believe* it. you actually *showed*.  shark: hope you said your goodbyes, 'cause all your cards are about to be *mine*.  yuma: sorry, but the only think *you're* gonna be getting, is a good oldfashioned buttkicking. shark: and why's that. yuma: 'cause i'm feelin'... the flow.  yuma: duel disk, go..  yuma: duel gazer, let's roll. <13:00>  computer: augmented reality vision link established.  yuma and shark: let's duel..  tori: yeah, yuma. win this. yuma : get set to get decked. yah.  yuma: i summon zubaba knight.  yuma: you're goin' down, shark.   zubaba knight: zubaba *knight*. act 3 <13:36> yuma: i summon zubaba knight.   zubaba knight: zubaba *knight*. yuma: 'course since i went first, i'm not allowed to attack *this* turn. so go aheadyour move. shark: hmhm. got *that* right. and *with* it, i intend to *crown* that knight. it's my draw. hah. <14:00>  shark: i summon forth big jaws.  yuma: man. eighteen hundred attack points. shark: that's right. and since zubaba knight is just sixteen hundred, you're in *deep water*. after all, when two monsters fight, the one with the least attack points is destroyed, and its owner takes the difference as damage.  yuma : aw, great, so that means i'm losing two hundred lifepoints. shark : next time, play your weak monster in *defense* mode.  althoughit really wouldn't've mattered this time. 'cause a' *this*. the spell card, "aqua jet". now until the end of this turn, my big jaws gains one thousand attack points.   there it is. yep, shark's super spell combo. shark: now, big jaws, it'sfeeding time. attack.  zubaba knight: zubaba power....  yuma: hah. my lifepoints. shark: next i'll place a facedown card, and end my turn.  yuma: nuts.... we just started, and i'm already down in a big way. i gotta even the score. i summon out, gagaga magician.   shark: you're summoning him in attack mode, with just fifteen hundred attack points..  you just don't listen, do ya. yuma: oh, i sure *do*.  yuma: hyah. that's why i'm equipping gagaga with *this*"wonder wand".  yuma: now my magician gains five *hundred* attack points. you said play weak monsters in defense modewell, he's no *weak monster*. tori: hey, all right. now gagaga's stronger than big jaws. yuma: now go, mighty magician. <16:00> reel in that *fish*. shark: how 'bout *you* try an' *get* real. i play my *facedown*.  yuma: your facedown.... shark: that's right"zeus' breath".  shark: and i have a feeling it's gonna *sting* for you because with this trap, i can put a stop to your monster's attack.  yuma: wha. whaaaaa. shark: *and* there's more. if i have a water monster on my field, you also take eight hundred points of damage. and there *is* a water monster on my field. soprepare to be soaked, with a serious splash of *damage*. yuma: aaaaaaahhh....  yuma: ohh, boy...  yuma: wait*i* got it.  yeah. if *you* can play trap cards, so can i. so that's what i'll do. bronk: *yuma.* you can play two types of facedowns, spells *and* traps<17:00> never say which it *is*. tori: ohh. get it together..  shark: trap card, huh. big *deal*it's my draw. and first i summon skull kraken.   yuma: six hundred attack points. all rightno prob. gagaga magician is still the strongest monster on the field.  shark: not for *long*, he's not. i activate skull kraken's special ability. with it, i can destroy one faceup spell or trap card on your field.  shark: such as that *wonder wand*, for example.  yuma: oh no. shark: oh, *yes*. now gagaga magician is back at the *bottom of the food chain*. bronk: not good. tori: why.  bronk : shark's got *two* monsters out *now*the same ones he had right before he beat *me*.  bronk: he must be plannin' an xyz summon. and if he gets it offthere's no *way* yuma will win this. <18:00>  tori: yuma... shark: you fool. did you really think you could *beat* me, the best a' the best, and win bronk's deck back.. yuma : yeah. i kinda *did*. guess i was wrong. i *thought* i was feelin' the flow, but maybe *not*.  shark: face it, yumai stomped your little key to pieces, and now, i'm gonna stomp *you*.. act 4 <18:20> shark: that's right, yumathis duel is over.. and when i win your *duel deck*, i'm gonna trash it just like i trashed your key.  shark: *then* maybe you'll learn your lessondon't pick fights ya can't win.  yuma: that's where you're wrong, shark. i'll *never* learn that lesson.  yuma : no matter how many times i fall...  yuma : no matter how many times i get laughed at...  yuma : i'll keep trying to highfive the sky...  yuma: 'cause when you're feelin' the flow, there's *no* goin' back. and *speaking* of feeling the flow, i so*am*..  yuma: huh..  <19:00>  yuma: whoa.... it's my dream. deep voice: this is no dream. have you the courage to unlock this power.  echo voice: ...new power... deep voice: it is time to decide, yuma. echo voice: have you the courage.... deep voice: what will it be.  echo voice: he *has* the courage...  yuma: yaaaaaaahhh.  yuma: all right.. let's *flow*..   yuma : what was *that*.... huh. and what's all *this*.   yuma: whoathat was weird. ah.... *hey*... <20:00>  yuma: my key... it's totally fixed. shark: ugh....  shark: yes, and *you*are *in* a fix. ahaaaaaaahhhhh...  voice: yes, shark... let the number take hold.... shark: yaaaaahhhhh..  shark: i overlay level threebig jaws and kraken.  shark: now i can build the overlay network.  shark: nownumber seventeen, leviathan dragon..  shark: be born..   yuma: what is that.. bronk: i've never seen this monster before in my life. tori: yeah. <21:00> same here.  bronk : and what's with the whole 'number' thing. shark: now by removing one a' my overlay units like my skull kraken, i can power up leviathan dragon by five hundred attack points. yuma: what.  shark: leviathan dragon, attack with *shock stream blast*...  tori: yuma. shark: this duel's *just about done*. one more attack and you're through.  yuma: ugh... that's... *some* dragon. so much for a comeback.  astral: rise.  yuma: huh. ohh.  astral: rise up.  yuma: ohh.... whowho're *you*.  end <21:56> * special thanks to youtube.com and user kyuzagura for the copy of this episode transcribed
