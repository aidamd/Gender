'first', *what*.. who d'you think you are.. shark: it's my turn now, isn't it. i draw.  shark: hunh... i summon, drill barnacle.  astral: three hundred attack points. you are lucky. yuma: waitwhaddaya *mean* i'm lucky. shark: i activate my dragon's ability. so by using an overlay unit, i can power up leviathan dragon's strength.  yuma: *three* thousand points now.... whoa. astral: since shark's leviathan dragon had one last overlay unit remaining... it was *obvious* what he would do. just as it is obvious what he will do *now*. yuma : what.. shark: it's time, leviathan dragon. attack gogogo golem.  yuma : just eight hundred points left. ohh... <9:00>  yuma : guess this guy was *right* about me being lucky. shark: i'm not finished *yet*, yuma. drill barnacle*dig in*.  yuma: ugh, *ow*. tori: *yuma*...   astral: for your information, when in defense mode, that golem has an effect that prevents him from being destroyed in battle. *now* do you understand, why i suggested you bring him out in defense mode. you're not very good at this.  yuma: be *quiet*.  astral: oh mywhat's this.  astral: my life force seems to be draining away...    astral: numbers.... yuma: huh.  astral: they're the key....  astral: the key to unlocking my sealed memory.... you seenumbers are special cards. even among xyz monsters... they cannot be defeated like regular cards. <10:00>  astral: and in a duel, when number cards are used, the winner *absorbs* the loser's number cards. yuma: where ya going with this.  astral: i don't know, for sure. all i do know is that you *must win*. yuma: uh... astral: otherwise, i will meet a *very* bad end. yuma: thanks a *lot*, no *pressure* or anything.  yuma : okay, let's see here. i don't have the cards for a counterattack. which means i'll just have to cross my fingers and hope that i can survive attacks from both leviathan dragon and drill barnacle until i do. shark: while ya think things overi activate drill barnacle's effect. because it was able to deal damage to you, it now gains one thousand attack points.  shark: *but just wait*, yuma. there's more. drill barnacle's a monster that can attack you directly. which means on the next turn, if that attack connects, you're *through*. yuma: nuts....  i wasn't planning on a direct attack.  what do i do. what do i do. what do i huh.. hey. <11:00> i'll play my *facedown*, that's what. hmmnow what did i throw down again.  astral: you played "bye bye damage". and had you activated it *earlier*, you would've dealt damage to shark. *and* gogogo golem would not have been destroyed. yuma : well *maybe i was distracted* because of all your *blabbing*. shark: speakin' of, how 'bout you zip it and *duel*. yuma: you stay outta this. shark: stay outta *what*, exactly. yuma : my talk with my invisible friend. shark: you know what's gonna be *invisible*. as in *vanished*. your *lifepoints*.  yuma: nope, still there. astral: but not for long, unless...  astral: *you start listening to me for some dueling advice*, yuma. *not later**now*. yuma: can i at least get a *please*. astral : *stop making dumb mistakes*... *please*. yuma: that's not what i meant.. just *go away*.. astral: on your next draw, we need a card that allows you to summon more than once this turn. yuma: a card that lets me do what.  astral: specialsummon a monster. yuma: *fine*. i'll *try*. <12:00> all right, for the sake of both my and bronk's decks, here goesi draw.  astral: "monster reborn". it seems that fate has come through for me this time. yuma: but *i'm* the one who drew it.. i summon ganbara knight in attack mode.  bronk: *yuma*. why'd'ja go with *attack* mode.. ganbara knight has zero attack points. yuma: *huh*.. aww. shark: just give up, yuma. you *can't win*. yuma: sorry, shark, but i *never* give up. feeling the flow means fighting 'til the very end. astral: 'feeling the flow'. yuma: that's right, *feeling the flow*, it's kinda my motto. it's about doing what can't be done. like right now. i'm gonna find a way to win this.  shark: *you're wrong*. the only thing *you're* gonna find, yuma, is the *bitter taste of disappointment*. and d'you know why. 'cause i have two monsters on the field and you have *one*with *zero attack points*. yuma : aahh... astral: it's fine. yuma: huh. <13:00> astral: it's good that ganbara knight's on offense. it gives us a chance to turn things around... *perhaps*. yuma: *perhaps*.. astral: quickbring back gagaga magician with monster reborn. yuma: what.  astral: there's no time to argue. you *must trust me*, please.  yuma: yeah, well, i was gonna do that *anyhow*. from my hand, i activate the spell card, "monster reborn". and with it, i bring back gagaga magician.  shark: so what. his fifteen hundred attack points are no threat to *me*. yuma: rrrghh... astral: at last, the stage is set. yuma: for what. astral: teamwork. overlay levelfour gagaga magician and ganbara knight. yuma: hang on a sec... is this what i think. astral: look at your deck, yuma.  yuma: ohh.... it looks like an xyz monster.  yuma: but i... ii can't quite make out which one. astral: *i* can. it's number thirtynine, utopia.  <14:00> yuma: hey, is thisa *number card*. astral: it is. and now it belongs to you, yuma. yuma: then let's see what this baby's got, 'cause i'm feelin' the flow *bigtime*. i overlay levelfour gagaga magician and ganbara knight.  yuma: and now that i have, i can do a little xyz summoning. so *here goes*. yuma and astral : rise on upnumber thirtynine, utopia.   yuma and astral : time to take out shark's monster, utopia. attack drill barnacle.  <15:00> yuma and astral: go, rising sun slash.  shark: aggghhh... yuma: yeah. you got numbercrunched. shark: how *dare* you.... astral: our job isn't finished yet. now to introduce utopia to leviathan dragon. act 3 <15:23> bronk: *another* number monster..... tori: where'd *it* come from. i don't remember yuma having *that* card before. bronk: same here. too weird. yuma: all righty, sharki end my turn.  yuma: heheh... how cool am i. i just made an xyz summon..  yuma: bronk. tori. tell me you saw that. tori: yeah, we *saw* it. yuma: wasn't it cool..  i am *so feelin' the flow right now*. <16:00> bronk: that's great, bututopia has twentyfive hundred attack points. leviathan dragon has three thousand. if shark attacks, it's *over*. yuma: oh yeahthat's bad. shark: *very* bad. 'specially since now, it's my turn. i draw. huah. from my hand, i activate the spell card "surface". and since i *did*, a water monster now surfaces from my graveyard. welcome back, big jaws.  shark: but he won't be back for long. i release him and tributesummon jawsman.  tori: tributesummon. bronk: yeah, it's when you forfeit a monster on the field to bring out a higherlevel monster.   shark: heh ha ha ha ha. now jawsman gains three hundred attack points for every other water monster on my fieldi have one. leviathan dragon. so jawsman powers up <17:00> to twentynine hundred attack points. now to put them to use. leviathan dragon, attack utopia.  yuma: oh well, it was nice while it lasted, utopia.  yuma: yaah. astral: if you use utopia's overlay unit, utopia will put a stop to leviathan dragon's attack. yuma: *now* ya tell me.. i activate utopia's special abilityby using an overlay unit to negate leviathan dragon's attack.  yuma and astral: go, lightwinged shield.  shark: so, you bought yourself some time. but that time'll eventually run outyour monster's not strong enough to beat mine. yuma: yeah, i guess shark kinda has a point. shark: *and* you only have one overlay unit left to protect yourself with. so when it's *gone*, your lifepoints will be gone too.  shark: and it looks like this is gonna happen sooner than later, <18:00> 'cause you're gonna have to use it up right now to protect yourself from jawsman. or utopia's fish food.  astral: what're you waiting for, yuma.. use utopia's special ability. yuma: yeah, i *could* do that... or i *could*....  haha. do *this*. i play the trap "bye bye damage". which means my monster can say 'byebye' to being destroyed this turn.  astral: i *told you* to use utopia's ability.. yuma: i don't always *do* as i'm told.  yuma: 'course... my lifepoints still take a hit from jawsman's attack. but *you* take the same damage, only *double*. shark: what..  yuma: ughh. tori: yuma only has one hundred lifepoints left.... shark: huhuhuhahaha. thanks for playin' that *trap*, yuma. because now *i* can play *my* trap. booming urchin.  shark: and it really *does* pack a punch, because come my turn, you'll be blasted with one thousand points of damage, <19:00> and i'll win this.  bronk: ohh... that's a major bummer. tori: oh, no... yuma.... shark: your deck is mine. act 4 <19:14>  shark: face it, yumayou have lost. yuma: not yet. i'm *not* givin' up.  yuma: farfrom it.
