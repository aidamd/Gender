'cause it's your fault that i'm even in this great big *mess*, astral. astral: my fault. how.  yuma: 'cause you're always *hovering around*, interfering. astral: untrue. when you sleep i no longer hover above you... more for *my* benefit, snorer. yuma: yeah, well, you don't exactly stay clear during my *duels*, now do ya. *until now*. this time, astral, i don't want you helping.  bronk: wait up.  tori: *yuma*, where on earth are you going. yuma: to go duel shark. this is where i heard he's been hanging.  <5:00> bronk: way creepy. whaddaya say we just grab some corn dogs instead. seriously. it's my treat...  bronk: wait. *yuma*...  yuma: what *is* this place.  astral: i am getting strange vibes. tori: we're coming too. bronk : tori, no...  tori: this place is *creepy*. heyya hear that.  yuma: what in the world.. bronk: hey, get offa me. llet go. scorch: whadda you little *pipsqueaks* doin' here. don'tcha know this is *our territory*.  yuma: hey. let bronk go.  yuma: aahh. tori: yuma....  yuma: lemme go. you're gonna be sorry. chills: i wouldn't bet on *that*.  weasel: well, whad' do we got *here*. if you're lookin' for trouble, it's *found*. heheh.  yuma: hey. just leave us alone.. or else, you're gonna have to deal with *me* when i get down.  <6:00> astral: that strategy is not sound. these thugs do not look like they will be putting *anyone* down, anytime soon. yuma: stay outta this, astral.  chills: hey scorch, what's the next move. scorch: teach 'em a *lesson*. heheh...  shark: stop.  shark: let go a' the little brats. yuma: shark.  scorch: whatyou *know* 'em or somethin'. shark: sure do.  chills: guess it's your lucky day.  all three: huh. shark: you shouldn't have come here.  yuma: i *came here*, 'cause i have business with you, shark.  shark: what *business*. yuma: the business of *dueling*, that's what. shark: huh..  shark: heheheh. i can't *duel you*. yuma: huh. how come. shark: because i *quit* dueling. yuma, tori, bronk: huh..  shark: i've moved on, *yuma*. and now i'm movin' on from *you*.  <7:00>  bronk: what d' they say about sharks. that they can't change their stripes. tori: no, bronk, that's *zebras*. bronk: whatever. point is, seems like shark sure changed *his*. so, yuma, what's *your* take on all this.  astral: after observing you, i think i know what you are going to say. 'good riddance to that bullying pest'. am i correct, yuma.  yuma: maybe... i don't know... but then again, maybe *not*. bronk: what exactly are you *talkin'* about, yuma. yuma: it's just always a shame when *any duelist* quits. bronk: yeah, guess you're kinda right about *that*... yuma: you're supposed to duel for *life*... not just give it up.   yuma: this 'shark' stuff's got me down, astral.  yuma: i gotta help 'im feel the flow again... 'cause if i don't, he might call it quits *forever*.  <8:00> bronk: hey, tori. uh, where's yuma. tori: uh, i dunno. he's not here, though. bronk: ugh, i was afraid a' this... shark: whadda you *want*.  yuma: you know what i want. a *duel*. question is, why don't *you* want one. what *happened* to you. shark: you wouldn't understand. yuma: yeah, i *would*. i get frustrated with dueling all the time*trust me*.  yuma: come on, shark. let's just *duel*. shark: for the last time, yuma*i have quit*.  yuma: shark... *wait*.   yuma: okay, time to highfive the skygaaahh.   yuma: you can't lose *me*.  yuma: yaaaahhh.   shark: i finally lost 'im. yuma: shark.  shark: huh..  yuma: you're not losing *anything*except the *duel* we're about to have. <9:00> whaddaya say.  yuma: aw, come on. i thought we were friends.  shark: rrrgghhhwe are *not friends*.. you got that.. why would you even think that *anyway*.. yuma: why would i think we're friends. because we dueled.  yuma: and as your friend, i'm gonna be the one to tell yathat it's time you dump those *thugs* you've been hanging out with.  shark: it's none a' your business *who* i hang out with, yuma. yuma: *oh yeah*. i'll *make it* my business. i beat you, and you ditch them. shark: yeah. and what do i get if i beat *you*. yuma: well, then you...  yuma: yyou get to have *this*. astral: no, yuma. wait. yuma: you keep quiet. shark: huh. okayy' got yourself a deal. and once this is all over, i'm gonna get that *necklace* a' yours.   astral: yuma, <10:00> are you sure about this. yuma: i told you, astral, i *don't* want your help during this duel. and that goes for all a' those number cards as well. astral: what do you mean.  yuma: i *mean* it's time i proved the duelist makes the cards, not the other way around. tori: oh, yuma... yuma: besidesit's not fair to use number cards against shark. *he* doesn't have any.  yuma: and heynow i've even got a *noble cause* that i'm dueling for. shark shouldn't be hanging with those jerks, and soon he *won't* be. astral: all right, then. consider me a spectator.  shark : i haven't forgotten our last duel, yuma.  shark : if i'm gonna come out of retirement, i can think of no better reason than to do it to beat *you*.  yuma: *game time*. duel diskgo.  yuma: duel gazerlet's roll.  computer voice: augmented reality vision link established. <11:00>  yuma and shark: let's do this. act 3 <11:08>  yuma and shark: let's duel.  yuma: all right i am feelin' the flow. i summon, gogogo golem.  astral: be careful, yuma. shark has a trove of powerful beasts. that golem is tough, butyuma: ah, zip it, astral. next i place one card facedown. and since i can't attack on the first move of the game, i end my turn.  the card i placed facedown is "battle break". nowif shark attacks, my trap card will destroy his attacking monster and end the battle. that'll show everyone my dueling skills. shark : my turn. i draw.. i summon, friller shark.   <12:00> astral: but it only has seven hundred attack points. what could shark be planning. shark: now i summon shark stickers.  shark: you see, yuma, when friller shark is on the field, shark stickers can be summoned *right from my hand*. astral: and i think i know what's coming next. yuma: uhoh... shark: now i overlay levelthree friller shark and shark stickers.  shark: with these two monsters i can build an overlay network and xyz summon.  shark: ha. now, say hello to aero shark.   yuma: nineteenhundred attack points. that's a hundred more than my golem. but stillnot more than my trap card can handle. shark: now i'll play aero shark's ability. by using up one overlay unit, you take four hundred points of damage for every card in my hand.  <13:00> shark: and since i have four cards in my hand, that adds up to sixteen hundred points a' damage, yuma. yuma: oh no.  shark: next i activate the spell "mystical space typhoon" from my hand. thanks to typhoon, i can blow off one spell or trap card on the field.  yuma: oh no. not my trap card...  shark: now go, aero shark. attack gogogo golem with devouring dive.  yuma: aaaaaaaahhhh. shark: i place one card facedown and end my move.  kazwell : unbelievable. yuma's down to twentythree hundred lifepoints after just one turn. bronk: shark duels pretty well for a retiree... tori: no joke. shark: well, yuma. i hope that you're happy with yourself. <14:00> you wanted a duel with me and you got one*and* all the hurt that comes with it. yuma: get real.  i'm not feelin' hurt at *all*.  well, maybe i'm feeling a *little*. but no point in sharin' that. i gotta do somethin'and fast.  my draw.  time to make a move.... now..  yuma: all right. i summon, gagaga magician.  yuma: and the magic of gagaga, is that once per turn, it can change its level to a number between one and eight.  yuma : that's *nothing* compared to what i have up my sleeve, or in my hand rather*monster reborn*.  yuma : if i use this to resurrect gogogo golem, i can bring utopia to the field. hold up. utopia is a number card. i said i wasn't using those this duel. ah, nuts. shark: go *on**play* that number. i *want* ya to. yuma: huh.. kazwell: has shark lost his mind. bronk: yeahonly a *number* can destroy a number, an' shark doesn't have one. <15:00> so why would 'e *want* yuma to play it. shark: *well*. we're *waiting*, yuma. you know playing it is the *only way you'll be able to beat me*.  then again maybe your number's not enough. maybe the only reason i agreed to duel you was to prove i could take *it* down. yuma : okay, now i'm really confused. i wanted to duel shark to prove i could beat him *without* using a number card. but he wants to duel *me* to prove he can beat me *with* a number card. astral: yuma. yuma: huh. astral: if the duelist really makes the card... yuma: yeah. astral: then it should not matter if that card in question happens to be weak, *or* to be strong. and besides all of that, what you've really set out to accomplish here is not to help out your ego as a duelistbut to help your friend shark. yuma: oh, yeah. i almost forgot. i gotta get 'im to lose those loser friends a' his. and to make that happen, i'll do whatever it takes. i activate the spell card, <16:00> "monster reborn". and now bring back gogogo golem from my graveyard.  yuma: next i overlay levelfour gagaga magician and gogogo golem.  yuma: all right. with these two monsters, an overlay network has been built. and that meansi can xyzsummon. so appear, number thirtynine, utopia..   tori: yuma just played a number card. bronk: yeah, what *gives*. i thought he was *done* with those digits. kazwell : it's like i saidyuma needs number cards to win. i knew i was right. shark: yes, yumado it.  shark: *attack me*. act 4 <16:50>  shark: yes, yumado it.  shark: attack me with your number monster. <17:00> yuma: all rightgo, utopia. take out aero shark. shark: i'm not afraid. i play friller shark's ability.. by banishing the friller shark in my graveyard from play, your utopia's attack is stopped. *and* it loses five hundred attack points.  yuma: no. shark: next i play, "fish rain". thanks to *this* trap card, when a fishtype monster is banished from play, i can summon a levelthreeor below fish monster from my hand. and this one, has some *bite*.  shark: come outbig jaws. yuma: not good. now i'm in an even bigger fix than before. astral: yes. you are, yuma. i was afraid this would happen. yuma: huh.. astral: what you failed to recognize is that monster reborn can also bring back a monster from *another* player's graveyard. you could've brought back *friller shark*, <18:00> and used gagaga magician's levelchanging ability, and then xyzsummoned leviathan dragon.  astral: and then you could've used leviathan dragon to *destroy* aero shark. yuma: ugh. oh, well. i'll get 'im next time. after all, utopia has two thousand attack points. shark doesn't have a monster on his field stronger than that.  yuma: all right, shark, make your move. shark : never mind about *me*it's aero shark and its abilitythat *you* should be worried about.  shark: because now, just like before, by using one overlay unit, you take four 'undred points a' damage for every card in my hand. i have *two*.  shark: so that's a walloping worth *eight hundred*.  shark: next i summon skull kraken..  yuma: *two* levelthree monsters..... astral: it is all right. he still does not have a card that can destroy a number like utopia. <19:00> shark: i now overlay skull kraken and big jaws. and because i have, i can now xyz summon. welcome to the duel, the mighty black ray lancer..   shark: and now for the best part. i activate, lancer's ability. by using one overlay unit, your utopia's ability is negated this turn. yuma: what..  yuma: nooooo. shark: that's right, yumathe ability where only a number can destroy another number is *gone*. so now your utopia can be taken down like *any other card*. yuma: he's *right*. which meansmy number's about to be seriously *crunched*. shark: go, black ray lancer. attack with *shimmering spear slash*.  <20:00> yuma: utopia..  yuma: and i can't believe it's *gone*... astral: *i* cannot believe shark knows a number's weakness.... shark: aero shark.. attack yuma. devouring dive.  kazwell: so even with a number, yuma *lost*. tori: he got *trounced*poor guy.  yuma: not just trounced*completely annihilated*.  shark: i suppose now i can tell ya. the reason that i stopped dueling, yumawas because i was *crushed* when you beat me.  shark: but i feel all *better* now.  shark: and this here is just the *cherry on top*.  shark: then again, *keep it*. as a reminder of what i *did to you*.  yuma: shark, nodon't go.  shark: yuma, you an' i're *finished*so don't you ever come botherin' me again.  shark: you may think those friends a' mine are *thugs*but they're all that i have. and that's just *fine with me*.  yuma: shark...  tori: shark...  yuma: i failed, astral.  yuma: i failed.  end <21:50> * special thanks to
