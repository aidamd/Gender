  act 1 <2:14>  flip: heheheheh. *sorry*, yuma, but utopia, your *best monster* is now under *my control*.  and utopia *stays* with me as long as it's equipped with  "ultra c". there's no *way* you can stop me. victory will be mine, and so will your precious utopia card. yuma: ugghh. i can't believe flip tricked me into this jam.  yuma: whoa. you okay.  flip: *no*, yuma, i'm *not* okay... i feel much, *much* better than okay..  yuma: what on *earth* is going on.  flip: something... taking... over.... deep voice: yes, let the number take hold.... <3:00>  flip: gaaaaaahhh... aaaahhh..  yuma: huh. astral: it seems flip has been infected by a number. yuma: by a *number*.  yuma: whoathirtynine. that's *utopia's* number.  yuma: this isn't good....  yuma: astral.  astral: mmm... mymy body.... yuma: what's going on. what's happening to you.   fb astral: in a duel where number cards are used, the winner *absorbs* the loser's number cards.  yuma: and if i recall correctly, if that happens, it means bad news for astral. flip: *quit talking to yourself*. yuma: huh.  flip: after all, we have a *duel* to finish. yuma : yeahand the stakes have never been higher. if i'm gonna stand a chance, i'm gonna need to take down *utopia*. but to *beat* a number monster, i *need* a number monstergood thing i have *two*, leviathan dragon and terrorbyte. problem is, right now levelfour gagaga and levelthree flelf  won't help me in summoning either of them. <4:00> so that meansi've got no other choice...  i end my turn. flip: given up *already*, yuma. lemme show ya how a *winner* duels. watch and*learn*.  i think i'll start things off with a bang. actually, make that a *slash*utopia, attack flelf.  yuma: ugh... flip: looks like *i've* just taken the lead in lifepoints.  flip: *and*, i aim to *keep it*. i now place a monster facedown in defense mode. there. *that's* how ya take a turn with some *talent*. why don't you *try it again*. yuma: careful whatcha *wish* for, flip. here goes..  yuma: perfect. this card should get my *duel motor runnin'*. i summon levelthree rai rider.   yuma: next i activate gagaga's ability. which means this card's level can change to a number between one and eight, until the end of the turn. so i'll be changing gagaga magician to level *three*, just like rai rider. and you know what *that* means... i get to *overlay* gagaga magician and rai rider.  yuma: now i'll use this overlay network to summon out yuma: a mighty xyz. so say hello to number seventeen, leviathan dragon..   flip: ah.... number *seventeen*. so then i guess there are a *buncha* numbers.  <6:00> all the more for *me* to snatch up. ah. i activate the trap card, "traitor fog".  yuma: whoa. what's going on *now*. ah.  flip: a *fog* is rolling in. and it's about to *roll back* your lifepoints, yuma. because now, i gain control of the monster *you just summoned*.  yuma: leviathan dragon. no.  flip: heheheheh, *oh yeah*..  yuma: oh, man. now things are *twice* as bad for me.  yuma: and for *astral*, too. act 2 <6:47>  tori: i *knew it*. this photo has been doctored. bronk: you're totally right, it's a pure cut'n'paste job.  tori: yeahand not just on *one* photo, on them *all*. i *knew* yuma was innocent, and now we can *prove* it. bronk: yeah, but who's *behind* all this. tori: hmm...  tori: i don't know, but maybe *spencer* does. we've *gotta* find 'im. lemme try his cell again.  tori: spencerit's tori and bronk. spencer : huh. oh. hey there. tori: where *are* you. we've been *looking* for youspencer : yeah, i've been busy.  tori: whwith *what*. spencer : gotta gobye.  tori: wha. bronk: nnnnghh, he hung up. tori: yeah, but the chimes we heard gave away his location.  yuma: astral. you okay.. say something.. flip: there he goes talkin' to himself again.  yuma. it's clear you've already lost your *mind*<8:00> now let's get back to the match so you can *lose this duel*, too.. yuma: what is it with you.. why d'ya gotta be so mean all the time, flip.. flip: i'm not mean, the *world* is. yuma: huh. flip: and i learned it the *hard way*, yuma.  flip: ya see i wasn't *always* like this. i was once a *sap like you*. yuma: huh. flip: it was way back when i first entered the duel monsters world.  *hey, flip.* we heard you've started dueling. would you mind teaching *us*.  fb young flip: i'd be *glad* to. so what're you *putting up*. fb young flip: hmm. whadda you mean, put up.  he means, which *card*. the winner of the duel gets a card from the loser. fb young flip: uhi dunno.  but'cha *do* know way more about dueling than *us*, so there's no *way* you're gonna lose.  *totally*, flip. you've really got *nothing to worry about*. fb young flip: uhh...  flip : but they were *lying*. i had *plenty* to worry about. *they knew how to duel*..  flip : still i fell for it over and over again. soon i had lost almost all of my cards.  <9:00>  you know what they say guys, 'there's a sucker born every minute'.  funny, a minute's about as long as it takes to beat lil' flip in a duel, too. huhuhuh.  flip : they were nice to my face but *mean* behind my back. flip : that's when i realized that there was *always* something going on, on the flip side..  fb young flip: aaaaaaggghhhhh..  fb young flip: oof.  flip: and *that's when i decided*, i would learn to become the *master* of the flip side. yuma: sad story...  tori: spencer. bronk: ohh, he's *not here*.  tori: well, he's gotta be *somewhere*, let's keep looking.   tori: spencer.  bronk: spencer.. flip: and so it began. the more i *studied* the way of the flip side, the more i learned.  flip : it applied to *everything*. and *i* took advantage. if my enemies were pretending to be nice but were truly mean, i would pretend to be fair but would truly *cheat*.   aaaaaaahhhh. flip : and it *worked*. i got *all* my cards backand something i didn't see coming.  flip : *respect*. soon, i developed all *sorts* of different strategies to get what i wanted with my 'flip side' method.  flip: and without fail, it always *worked*. i won at everything. including duels, where winning matters the most. yuma: but that's where you're wrong, flip. dueling's not just about winning. it's about having fun, and doing the best you can do. flip: you know who says things like that, yuma. *total losers like you who never win.* yuma: rrrggghhh...  tori: any luck, bronk. bronk: i got nothin'. tori: ohh, and we've looked *everywhere*. waitdid you go to the old gym. bronk: i thought *you* did.  let's move out.  tori: spencer.  spencer: ah.  spencer: ohh. whaddaya want.. i was so close to being finished.  tori: sorry, spencer, we didn't mean to interrupt your, uhyour... uh, actually, what exactly *are* you doing. spencer : i'm setting up dominoes. flip said he'd give me an xyz monster if i spent all day in here making this lineup for 'im. tori and bronk: *flip* said that.. tori: of *course*. bronk: flip sent those photos out and tricked spence' into hiding out here, so that spencer wouldn't be able to tell anyone the toad photos are fake. tori: but the question is, *why*.  tori and bronk: a duel..  yuma : the only number monster i have left is terrorbyte. and i can't waste any time in summoning it<12:00> so it's a good thing i have the spell "release lease". hopefully, it'll give me a new *lease* on this duel.  yuma : 'cause *with it*, i can get rid of a monster on my field, to add a levelthree monster to my hand. now let's get to it, and release baby tiragon.  astral: yuma. you must protect baby tiragon... yuma: huh. astral: it is our *only hope*... yuma: astralare you okay.. astral: protect... baby tiragon.... yuma: but, baby tiragon can't defeat a *number* monster. astral: protect tiragon.  yuma: all right... i'm switching baby tiragon into defense mode.  yuma: then i'll place one card facedown and end my turn.  flip: and it will be the *last* card that you play. heheheheheh. 'cause now it's *my turn*. and that means *you're* through.. act 3 <13:00>  bronk: ohh, where could yuma *be*.. tori: the only place we haven't checked is the mall. bronk : hm. flip: i play leviathan dragon's ability. yahahahaha.. and *now*, yuma, by using up one of its overlay units, leviathan gains five hundred attack points.  flip: next i'm going to do a flip summon. yuma: what's a flip summon.  flip: i thought we'd been *over* this, yuma. i can turn a monster that's facedown and in defense mode face *up*oh, and i can make it change into attack mode as well.  flip: see for yourself. rise, flipangatan.   flip: now, to use flipangatan's flip effect. it switches *your* monster from defense mode to attack mode.  <14:00> yuma: oh no. so much for protecting baby tiragon. flip: now go. make that baby go *boom*, leviathan dragon. sonic shredding stream. yuma: i activate the trap, "half unbreak". but it gives me a *big* break, cause now one monster on my field cant be destroyed this turn. also, the damage from your attack is cut in half.  flip: so your trap protects you from full damage. but if you *recall*, utopia has twentyfive hundred pounding attack points. so this attack is still gonna pack a heavy punch. yuma: rrgh. flip: so let im have it, utopia.  yuma: aaaahhhh..  flip: but im not done yet. im now activating the spell card book of flip. <15:00> with this card, i can now flip flipangatan facedown.  flip: which means i can use its special ability again.  yuma: so if i switch baby tiragon to defense mode, if flip attacks, flipangatans special ability will change it back to attack mode.  yuma: ill be in big trouble. flip: *bingo*. *also, you only have three hundred lifepoints left. which means, as soon as it becomes my turn again, ill be able to take you out for *good*. *and* take your utopia. yuma: this is bad. tori: yuma.  yuma: tori. bronk. tori: yuma, whats happening. flip: *ill* tell you whats happening.  im about to *beat your buddy*.  act 4 <15:48>  tori: whoa, flip's winning by a *ton*. bronk: yeah, and why're utopia an' leviathan on *his* field, those're *yuma's* monsters.  flip: they *were* his. 'til i snatched 'em from 'im. <16:00> yuma: it's my turn, but i only have three hundred lifepoints left. i've *gotta protect 'em*.  here goes. i draw.  yuma : stinging swordsman. that's not the kinda defense i was hoping for. flip: huhahahahaha. yuma: huh. flip: by your expression, i'd say you didn't get the card you wanted. yuma : ugh. guess i don't have much of a *poker face*. tori : yuma... flip: well, don't blame your *duel deck* too much. after all, i doubt you could do much with *any card* at this pointwhat with the *useless xyz monster* you have out on your field, its points are a *joke*.  yuma: points don't make the monster. ... ah.  fb astral: *protect tiragon*.   yuma: waiti wonder if astral meantoh. of course. he wanted me to protect tiragon for its *ability*, not its defense points.  yuma: a great ability is the flip side of *lots* a' weak monsters. and nowget ready, tiragon.  yuma: i summon, stinging swordsman. <17:00>  stinging swordsman: huahhuh.  flip: only three hundred attack points. that monster can't *possibly* hurt me. yuma: i wouldn't be so sure. an' would you like to know *why*, flip. 'cause baby tiragon's *not* so useless.  yuma: and 'cause i'm feelin'the flow. baby tiragon, by using your overlay unit, my levelone monster, stinging swordsman, can attack flip directly.  yuma: so nowlet's do it..  flip: *excuse me* if i don't go running for the hills, but three hundred points of damage isn't exactly *flinchworthy*.  yuma: oh, yeah. try *this*i play stinging swordsman's ability.  stinging swordsman: slash hurricane. <18:00>  flip: slash hurricane.. yuma: ya see, flip, when stinging swordsman successfully deals you damage, then all spells and trap cards on your field return to your hand. flip: *all* of them.. yuma: bingo. and if the cards that *snatched* utopia and leviathan dragon return to your hand, then utopia and leviathan dragon return to *me*.  flip: oh, please, you can't do this to me.  flip: aaaugh...  yuma: yeah. welcome home, you two.  yuma: astral. <19:00> yyou okay. astral : not yet. yuma: huh.. astral: go, leviathan. attack that facedown card. yuma: rrrggghhh. no, it's *my* duel, don't go.  yuma: then again, that's a *pretty good call*. leviathanattack flip's facedown card.   flip: whaaaa. yuma: go, sonic shredding stream..  tori: all right.. bronk: flip doesn't have any monsters left on the field now.  flip: huh. whwha.... yuma: utopia. go, and take him down.. rising sun slash.  flip: aaaaaahhh. mommyyyy. aaaaahhh. uh. agh. uhh...  yuma: yeeaahh. that's how ya *flow*. tori: yuma.. <20:00> bronk: way to go, buddy.  ...there are twoforone pretzels in the food court today. get *your* coupons at the mall kiosk.  astral : nicely done. you saved me from a very bad fate. yuma: aww, i didn't do it for *you*, i just wanted to win. tori: yuma. yuma: huh. heeheehee.  bronk: that was an *amazing comeback*, bud. yuma: yeah, i guess it *was* pretty great...  flip: all my tricks... ugh... and still ilost.  yuma: hey, flip. flip: huh.  yuma: i believe this belongs to *you*. flip: it *did*. yuma: it *does*. take it. you earned it, flip. just like you earned my respect the right way, by *not* cheating. flip: uh. yuma: that's gotta feel good inside, doesn't it. flip: ...yeah, i guess it sorta *does*. yuma: *sorta*. listen, all the respect you *think* you got by cheating, wasn't real at all. you were just tricking yourself. flip: maybe...  flip: ... or maybe this is all just a *trick*, and the flip side is <21:00> you're gonna make me look like a *big fool*.  yuma: come on. that's impossible. i mean, there's no *way* could make *you* look foolishnot with those *dope specs* you're always sportin'. they're pretty hip. flip: ... you think my glasses are... *hip*. yuma: yeah, totally.  flip: *yuma*.  flip: that's the nicest thinganyone's ever said to me..  flip: forget the flip side. life can be pretty great when you just take something at face value.  flip: so i'm turning over a new leaf, right now. you keep the card, yuma. yuma: huh. are you sure.  flip: yeah.  yuma: ahahahaha, *thanks*. i *did* kinda form a little bit of a bond with it.  yuma: heylike you said before, flip, this card can be a symbol of our friendship. flip: sounds good. <22:00>  bronk: maybe there's no *flip side* to this, but there *is* an annoying side. astral : observation number nine... glasses are 'hip'.  tori: okay. you guys can stop laughing now... *really*.  spencer: the last domino.  spencer: wait... no. *no*.  spencer: nooooooooo... ... i am *so* gonna *flip out*... end <22:35> * special thanks to animeratio.com for the copy of this episode transcribed online. * special thanks to yugioh wikia as a source for checking cards. * special thanks to kazuki takahashi, 4kids, et al. for yugioh. zexal. last updated: may 22, 2013 i don't own yugioh zexal, at all, and this transcript is unofficial and without any permission whatsoever. please link back to me if you use my work. for more information about my transcript format, please click here. read my commentary on this episode here )
