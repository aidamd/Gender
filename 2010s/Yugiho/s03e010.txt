 yuma: whaa. this is bad. i've gotta score some more lifepoints before i reach a fieldor i'm toast.. tori: come on. *keep it together*, yuma.. astral: unfortunately, i do not see any traps or spell cards that will allow you to regain lifepoints. yuma: rrgh... and i've gotta *battle someone*.  yuma: whoa. whoooa. tori: *i said keep it together*.. yuma: whaddaya think i'm tryin' to do, tori.. both: whaaaaaa.   act 1 <<1:33  vetrix: heheheheheheheheh... dextra: i don't know what your goal in this tournament is, vetrix, but there's no way i'm letting you duel kite.  vetrix: awwwwwhy do *you* care so much about what happens to *him*. dextra : because i care about him. that's why. vetrix: hmhmhmhm. well, *isn't that precious*.  mr. heartland: looks like we've got a faceoff in the *jungle field*.. it's dextraa former member of our own tournament organizing committeeand the mysterious young duelist known as vetrix. remember, each feeling in the dragon's den has a unique active field spell. let's find out what the jungle field has to off mr. heartland: what happened to the video feed.. what is the meaning of this.  mr. heartland: it seems we're having *technical difficulties*. sincerest apologies. someone get on this and fix this *immediately*.  mr. heartland : hmhmhm. not that you'll be *able* to. i've made sure that *no one* will see this duel.  dextra and vetrix: let's duel. vetrix: ah. ngh, you saved up *eight thousand lifepoints*. looks like *someone* was a busy bee. what are ya, scared a' me or something. dextra: i'm not scared at *all*, vetrix. but *you* should be. in the jungle field, if you don't summon or place a monster facedown during your turn, you take one thousand points of damage. this jungle will be your *end*.  now let's go. i draw..  dextra: first i activate the spell "dance of the butterspy". this card grants me the power to summon both morpho butterspy and swallowtail butterspy directly from my hand.   dextra: now i *overlay* morpho butterspy and swallowtail butterspy.  dextra: with these two monsters, i build the overlay network. i xyz summon, photon papilloperative.  vetrix: an xyz already.. dextra: and there's a *lot more* where that came from. *three spell cards*, to be exact. i hope you didn't forget how *dangerous* this jungle field can be, vetrix. with it in play, if you don't summon a monster or place one facedown every turn, you take damage. vetrix: yeah. you kinda mentioned that. dextra: heheh. but what i *haven't* mentioned yet is that if you don't attack with your monster, "butterfly charm" destroys it. vetrix: so then i'll *always* attack. dextra: be my guest'cause the *second* spell is "elimigate". when a monster other than photon papilloperative tries to pass through this gate to attack, that monster is instantly destroyed. vetrix: ugh... so then there's nothing i can do. dextra: that's right, vetrixevery path in this jungle leads to damage and destruction. vetrix: this isn't faaaair. dextra: i'm not done. vetrix: huh.. dextra: i've still got one more spell on my field to play. "butterfly swarm". i have to pay two thousand lifepoints in order to activate it...  dextra: but *once* it's activated, when a monster on the field is destroyed, the player controlling that monster gets slammed for fifteen hundred points of damage. vetrix: so if i don't summon a monster in my turn, i'll take some serious damage. but if i *do* summon a monster in my turn, that monster gets destroyed and i *still* take damage.  dextra: with the power of this combo, you'll be swallowed up by the jungle in three turns..  dextra : i promised i would protect you, kite, and that's *just what i'm going to do*. act 2 <<5:12 dextra : kite, i *will* protect you, just as i swore so many years ago...  fb mr. heartland: *stay strong*, young duelists.  fb mr. heartland: i know you're battling *pain and fatigue*, but remember. if you can survive these exercises, you will become one of a select group of elite duelists who will *lead the next generation*.  fb dextra: i activate a trap..  fb kite: i draw..  uh, sir, that'sfb mr. heartland: quiet. but, the aggression settings have never been tested at this intensity. fb mr. heartland: *i said quiet*..  fb nistro: aaaaaaaagggghhhhh. fb dextra: nnnnnngggggghhhhhh.  fb mr. heartland: it seems our dueling bot has *lost all control*. you're not walking out of that test chamber unless one of you wins the duel.  fb nistro: aagghh. rrggh... dextra..  fb dextra: aaah. no.. fb kite: i got thiiis.  fb dextra: kite.... fb kite: i draw.. i summon, daybreaker.   fb kite: go, daybreaker. put an end to this now.  fb mr. heartland: *excellent* dueling, kite. we'll definitely be keeping an eye on *you*. the rest of you take note*that's* what a duelist looks like.  fb mr. heartland: now, back to your dorms.  fb kite: you were lucky *this* time that i was around to save your neck. but i won't be around forever. never forget that the only person you can count on, is yourself.   fb dextra : it's *kite*....  fb dextra : and i think i heard someone say that kid is kite's little brother.  fb kite: hart, look. a *butterfly* came here to see ya.  fb dextra : the other kids say there's something... *different*, with that kid... and that everything kite does, he does for hart.  fb dextra : he seems *lonely*. i meanif he's busy looking out for *hart*, who's looking out for *kite*.  dextra: just as kite protects his little brother, *i swore* that i would protect kite. this is something i do alone, *for him*. vetrix: so you've got it in for me 'cause of a *schoolgirl crush*. dextra, that is the lamest thing i've ever heard in my life. ahahahahahaha.  tori: where are we.  astral: the jungle... interesting.  yuma: dextra.... is dueling * vetrix*. *this* i gotta see. act 3 <<8:46  yuma: dextra....  yuma: huh. vetrix: hey. yuma..  vetrix: look at how much my life stiinks. i've been caught in a deadly combo from which there's *no escape*. yuma: a *combo*....  yuma: is he talking about the spell cards on dextra's field. astral: that is correct. yuma: huh. astral: you see, dextra has caught vetrix in an extremely powerful combo that not only destroys all his monsters, but also deals damage to *him* every turn. yuma : pretty solid strategy. astral: but, there *is* a way to escape it... vetrix: of *course* there is. astral : huh. vetrix: my turn. i draw.  because of the jungle field, i *have* to summon a monster. but if i summon it in attack mode, her combo activates. *so*, in *that case*.  i summon a monster facedown in defense mode. then i place one card facedown and end my turn. whoo. lucky i was able to tiptoe around your scary combo this turn. dextra: that was *pretty clever*. but i've got news for you. it's going to take a lot more than 'clever' to beat me. it's *my turn*. i draw.. first, i pay two thousand lifepoints to keep butterfly swarm on my field.  dextra: next i activate papilloperative's special ability. by using one overlay unit, one monster is forced to switch to attack mode.  dextra: then that monster loses six hundred attack points.   vetrix: now heraldic beast aberconway's in attack mode. dextra: photon papilloperative, attack vetrix's monster with vivid swarm.  dextra: and now, butterfly swarm descends on you for fifteen hundred points of damage.  dextra: your tournament will end here, in *this jungle*. yuma: wow, that was *awesome*, dextra. dextra: i place a monster facedown in defense mode. your move.  vetrix: *keep talking*, dextra... keep on thinking you're winning... dextra : ...i *will not* allow you to harm kite.  yuma: uh. vetrix: this isn't just some schoolgirl crush. you seem like you're willing to sacrifice *everything* for him.  vetrix: he's really got a *special place in your heart*, doesn't he. yuma: wait, *what*. whad' i miss. someone's in someone's *heart*.  tori: yuma, you're *so thickheaded*. dextra: you're right. i *would* sacrifice everything for him. but that doesn't matter right now'cause you can't escape my combo. vetrix: we'll see about that. i draw. i summon heraldic beast berners falcon.  dextra: guess you've accepted your fate. since you summoned a monster in attack mode, the butterfly charm spell activates.  dextra: due to the power of *this* card, heraldic beast berners falcon is forced to attack. next, elimigate's effect activates. your monster is *automatically destroyed*.  dextra: and now, because of butterfly swarm. you take another fifteen hundred points of damage.  yuma: that was amazing. looks like dextra really might be able to take down vetrix.  dextra: i did it.... just *one more turn*, and kite will be safevetrix: hahahaha.   vetrix: ahahahahahahaha, haha, that'sthat's a good one. 'kite will be safe'. you're probably clinging to all these dumb little memories of your *precious kite*, aren't you. i look forward to seeing them. hehehahaha.  vetrix: here i go. i activate the "advanced heraldry art" spell card. this allows me to use heraldic beasts in my graveyard to xyz summon. *so glad* you put them there. yuma: you can xyz summon with monsters in your graveyard..  dextra: rrrgghh.... vetrix: i overlay aberconway and berners falcon.  vetrix: with these two monsters, i build the overlay network, and xyz summonnumber eight, heraldic king genomheritage.  vetrix: someone's tournament will end herebut it *won't be mine*. hahahahahahahahaha..   vetrix: welcome to the beginning of the end.. act 4 <<13:55  yuma: look at that. astral: vetrix possesses... a number. vetrix: heheheheh. well, now that i have *that* out on my field, *i end my turn*. dextra: rgh. you think i'm scared of a *number card*. better think again. i *draw*..  dextra: ugh. this is gonna end, *now*. vetrix. i activate photon papilloperative's special ability..  dextra: by using one overlay unit, it forces your monster into attack mode.  dextra: and that monster loses six hundred attack points. mystifying menace.  dextra: and now, photon papilloperative, attack heraldic beast genomheritage . you're *finished*. go, vivid swarm..  yuma: all right. if this attack succeeds, it's *lightsout* for vetrix.  vetrix: not so *fast*, little hero. by using one overlay unit, i can choose one of genomheritage's three special abilities.  vetrix: and the one *i* choose lets me steal your monster's name.  dextra: what is this.. vetrix: my monster has a new identity. whaddaya think.  vetrix: from now on, my genomheritage shall be known as photon papilloperative.  vetrix: and *your little butterfly* loses its name *completely*. which means, it's *no longer a papilloperative*.  vetrix: and you *know* what *that* means. dextra: this *can't* be happening. vetrix: now, isn't this the part where your elimigate activates.. yes, it is.  vetrix: since your papilloperative is now nameless, it *can't* attack, and even betterit's *destroyed*.. dextra: no. he's broken up my combo. vetrix: and *now*, 'cause of your *own* butterfly swarm spell, you take fifteen hundred points of damage.  dextra: how.... how could i have allowed him to get through my defenses.   vetrix: oh, wait. i *almost forgot*.  vetrix: your memories. i'm going to *take* them. *all* of them.. just like i took hart's.   yuma: oh no.... without her memories...  yuma : dextra, you can't give up. remember why you're fighting.  yuma: you're fighting for *kite*..  dextra: kite...  dextra: yes. i remember. i have to keep fighting.. i summon moonlit papillon.  dextra: and for my next move, i'm flipping over my facedown card, blue mountain butterspy.  dextra: and now, i overlay blue mountain butterspy and moonlit papillon.  dextra: with these two monsters, i build the overlay network. i xyz summon, photon alexandra queen.   yuma: all *right*. she's not giving up. dextra: photon alexandra queen uses all of its overlay units to return every monster on the field *back to our hands*.  dextra: and for every monster that we get back, we take *five hundred points of damage*.  yuma: what. astral: she's hoping to *tie*. dextra: go, butterfly breakdown.  dextra: this will finish us both. but surviving this duel doesn't matter to me... the only thing i care about is *stopping you*.. vetrix: well that's *too bad*, dextra. because i'm afraid there's *nothing you can do to stop me*. eheheheheheh. i activate, "heraldry record". this trap can negate any special ability that uses overlay units.  tori: ahh... yuma: no. no way.  vetrix: ehehehehanything *else*.  dextra : i end... my turn. yuma: dextra. you can't give up..   dextra : i'm sorry, kite... i... i failed you.  vetrix : that's right, you *failed him*. *poor little you*.  vetrix: it's *over*. you've lost. eheheheheh. it's my turni draw. time for you to go to sleep, *night night*. photon papilloperative will sing you a lullaby, attack photon alexandra queen.  yuma: nooooooooooooo... vetrix: vivid swarm..  vetrix: and now, thanks to butterfly swarm's effectthis duel is *mine*..   dextra : kite... don't forget me.   yuma: vetrix..  vetrix: you're next, yuma. get readyyy.  yuma: hey. dextra.  dextra: ... i was just thinking about someone. but, who. suddenly i can't *remember*...  tori: ohh, no.... astral: her memories have been taken. yuma: vetrix.. you're gonna *pay for this*..  end <<20:26 * special thanks to
