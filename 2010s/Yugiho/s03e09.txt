  act 1 <<2:38  mr. heartland : oh my. things are not looking good for young yuma tsukumo.  he's become the target of those duel desperadoes, those cunning cardsharks, those masters of malicethe triad of terror. and their *terrible* triple threat offensive.   mr. heartland: this is shaping up to bethe *mustsee*duel of the year.   bronk: ya got *that* right, heartland.. cathy: just feel the flow.  vetrix: ahahahaha, i can hardly *wait*, for the triad of terror to meet yuma, and show me what this kid can *do*.  fb wolfsbane: so you want us to take on this yuma tsukumo kid.  fb quinton: correct. just name your price, gentlemen. fb jackal: i like the sound a' *that*. fb coyote: oh yeah, works for *me*. fb wolfsbane: then we're *all* in agreement. we'll *crush* this yuma in the blink of an eye. fb vetrix: oh, no.   fb vetrix : simply *toy* with him, wolfsbane. i need to see what this boy can do with a deck.  vetrix: and then i will learn what i need to know. i will at last fully witness the true nature of yuma's powers.  yuma: watch it, you. we're not playin' *bumper cars*. but since you wanted my *attention* so bad, i'd be more than happy to *give it to ya*. i summon gagaga caesar.  yuma: gagaga caesar, attack magnet saucer.  yuma: *i'm* in the driver's seat *now*. astral: yuma, your confidence may be premature... look at the remaining monsters they possess.  yuma: their attack points went up.. hey, what gives.. wolfsbane: *what gives* is our trademark magnet monsters' special abilities, yuma. allow me to break it down. see, if any of our magnet monsters are destroyed, each of the remaining magnet monsters gains four hundred attack points. pretty cunning, don't you think. coyote: hahahahahaha.  coyote: allow me to demonstrate for ya. magnet saucer, attack his gagaga caesar.  yuma: they were both destroyed. astral: which is what they *want*. wolfsbane: now my magnet eagle's attack points soar to two thousand *because* my magnet saucer was destroyed. attack him directly..  wolfsbane: what's the *matter*, yuma, getting a little *hot under the collar*. well, you'll *cool off* now that my attack points return to normal.   vetrix: oh, come now, yuma, i know you can do better than this. i wanna see *everything that you can do*, my boy. hehehehehehehaha.  act 2 <<5:40  mr. heartland: if you're just joining us, duel fans, you won't wanna miss another *second* of the action. it's yuma tsukumo taking on the triplethreat offensive of the triad of terror.  mr. heartland: the *poor guy*.  mr. heartland: it's not fair. how long can this plucky, outmatched kid hold on.. there's only one way to find out, *keep it right here*, duel fans. *do not*missthis duel..  jackal: do your thing, magnet ape epsilon. coyote: you too, magnet crocodile zeta. jackal and coyote: come on out..    tori: oh, great, two *more* monsters to deal with. yuma: even if i can destroy them somehowastral: the other magnet monsters these three possess will gain attack points.  yuma: so... i'm in *trouble*. astral: no, yuma. not if you play gogogo golem. yuma: huh. astral: remember, if you play it in defense mode, then your golem cannot be destroyed once per turn. yuma: that's right. if i do that, then i'll give myself a chance to *change lanes* and get away from these three goons.  yuma: so now i summon gogogo golem.  wolfsbane: coyote, take care of that thing for *us*, would you. coyote: crocodile zeta, attack gogogo golem. full bite.  yuma: hang in there, gogogo golem. jackal: now, ape epsilon, attack gogogo golem as well. ape punch.  astral: seize the moment. change lanes now before you take another attack. yuma: oh, yeah.  coyote: ha, the kid's tryin' to *change lanes*. guess he's as dumb as he looks. jackal: are ya ready, coyote.  jackal: hit it..  yuma: oh, no. ahh. i can't lose 'em. astral: more of the triad of terror's tricky teamwork. wolfsbane: that yuma kid has only one thousand lifepoints left and my magnet eagle has twelve hundred attack points. if my direct attack on him succeeds, thenjackal: we stand to make *serious bank*. coyote: aw yeah, that's what i'm talkin' about. tori: *yuma*... yuma: what do i do.. gaaaahhh. vetrix: heheheheheheheheheheheheh. wolfsbane: this ends, now. go, magnet eagle. attack yuma directly.   wolfsbane: what's that..  wolfsbane: what's this all about. yuma: ah. hey, who're you. anna: someone who's gonna help you even the odds up. aahhh.  anna: long time no see, yuma. yuma: no way, it can't be. tori: it's *anna*.  yuma : first she wanted to blow me up and now she wants to *team* up..  yuma: don't tell me *you're* in the duel carnival *too*.. anna: i'll explain later, we're kind of in the middle of a *duel here*, yuma. go, rocket arrow. wolfsbane: five thousand attack points.....  coyote: no sweat, i got this.  yuma: you saved me, anna. but, how did you do it. i thought you weren't *dueling* in the carnival. anna: it's an *interesting* story.  i'll explain later. yuma: oh, *this* i gotta hear.  yuma: what was that.. tori: no one attacked. how'd that happen. astral: after a battle, rocket arrow express will *always* selfdestruct, unless of course its owner sends five cards in their hand to the graveyard. yuma: oh great. looks like anna forgot what her card can do. anna : heheheheheh... 'kay, my bad, but we'll win, don't sweat it. coyote: i think *you're* the one who's gonna be *sweating*. sweating *bullets* that is, when i activate the spell "magnet reborn". and soon you'll be *crying*, too, because now by paying five hundred lifepoints, i can call out crocodile zeta from my graveyard.   coyote: put the bite on 'em, crocodile zeta. yuma and tori: ahh. yuma: whoa, anna look out for that croc. anna: ahh.  anna: huh..  wolfsbane: we'll put you in a world of hurt for sticking your neck out for yuma.  yuma : anna. you've reached the draw lane. you've gotta pick a card now. anna : here goes. i summon out lionhearted locomotive in attack mode.  wolfsbane: your *choochoo train* doesn't scare me. especially since i'm activating the spell card "magnet fusion" from my hand. i tribute magnet eaglecrocodile zetaand ape epsilonto summon electromagnetic magnedragon.  anna: whoa. that's all types of bad news. tori: anna's in trouble. yuma: that's rightand this time it's my turn to save *her*. so *i draw*. and now, i summon bull blader.  yuma: uhoh, here comes trouble.  yuma: jackal. jackal: betcha guys *missed me*, huh. it's my turn, kid. i draw. and i summon magnet mannequin.  coyote : *my* turn now. and i summon magnet jammer.  wolfsbane: i've been waiting for this. magnedragon, attack lionhearted locomotive. magnainferno..  wolfsbane: when magnedragon destroys a monster, you take damage equal to the destroyed monster's attack points..  anna: aaaaaahhhh. yuma: annaaaaaaaaaaa.. act 3 <<11:32 tori: oh no. anna needs your help, yuma.  astral: yuma, please*be careful*. you are surrounded.  yuma: but not for long. watch this. all right, bull blader, do your thing. attack magnet mannequin.  jackal: thanks, you just activated mannequin's special ability. when it's destroyed, you take two hundred points' worth of damage. yuma: wuaaaahhhh.  jackal: and to show you ya can't keep a good monster down, i'll activate the spell card "magnet reborn", from my hand. by paying five hundred lifepoints i can bring back magnet mannequin from the graveyard.  jackal: *now* we'll just keep on attacking 'til we hack away all your lifepoints. yuma: aah, you wouldn't dare do it. you'll use all *your* lifepoints. jackal: *i don't need 'em*. yuma: huh.. coyote: we're a *team*, remember. even if *our* lifepoints run out, wolfsbane's will remain solid. wolfsbane: and crushing you means a big payday for *all of us*. yuma: *what* big payday.. astral: a *payday*. what could he mean, yuma. wolfsbane: we don't care about the world duel carnival, yuma. think of us as duel bounty hunters. we take punks like you on for cash. tori: someone's paying them.. yuma: who's got it out for me.. come on, ya gotta tell me. wolfsbane, jackal, coyote : wouldn't *you* like to know.  anna: i draw..  this is the only card i can summon right now. *please* let this do the trick.  i play express train trolley olley, in defense mode.   wolfsbane: one thousand defense points. ha. get real, that can't defend against my magnedragon. yuma: go. bull blader. attack magnet mannequin.  jackal: don'tcha remember.. ya lose two hundred lifepoints if ya take out magnet mannequin.  jackal: face it. you've lost, you can't take down the triad of terror. coyote: he's right, it's just a matter of time before we take *you* down. yuma: gah. i really hate to admit it... but *goggles* back there may have a point. astral: agreed. we are in dire straits. wolfsbane: *say goodbye*..  yuma: this is bad. nistro: hey, what's up, yuma. need a hand.. yuma and tori: huh. nistro: heroic challenger spartan, attack magnet jammer..  yuma: nistro.... wolfsbane: who's *this*. coyote: it's a new guest. so this calls for a *quick change of plans*. magnet jammer's ability returns our monsters to our hands. yuma: thanks, nistroyou're *just in time*.  yuma: now with nistro, the odds are finally fair.  anna: you're up. yuma: i know. nowbull blader, attack. wolfsbane: why bother. how do you plan to beat magnedragon's thirtyfive hundred attack points, with bull blader's *sixteen* hundred attack points. yuma: well why don'tcha *watch and learn*, wolflame. ya see, bull blader can stop magnedragon's battle damage and destroy it. wolfsbane: why, you dirty. ugh.  wolfsbane: i don't know about *you* gents, buti am getting a little sick and tired of this yuma kid. whaddaya say we finish him off once and for all. jackal and coyote : roger. i draw.  jackal and coyote : i summon magnet chameleon.    wolfsbane: funny thing about having *two* magnet chameleons. they negate your monster's special ability. so bull blader's *useless* to you now. yuma: uhoh. nistro: we'll see how useless it is. i draw. i summon heroic challenger extra sword.  nistro: try *this* on for size, chump.  coyote: aaaahhhh. wolfsbane: coyote.. this is bad.  astral: yuma, i may know why nistro stepped in to save you from that attack. yuma: yeah. astral: your bull blader, anna's trolley olley, and nistro's extra sword are all level four. if there are three levelfour monsters on the field, you can xyz summon. yuma: all right. i overlay levelfour bull blader, anna's trolley olley, and nistro's extra sword.  yuma: with these three monsters, i build the overlay network, and xyz summonthe mightyoneeyed skill gainer.   wolfsbane: twentyfive hundred attack points. and with magnedragon at *thirtyfive* hundred, what *ever* will i do. nistro: you'll freak out. since yuma used extra sword to xyz summon, oneeyed skill gainer gains one thousand attack points. anna: and my trolley olley's special ability adds an extra eight hundred attack points.  wolfsbane: i don't believe it. that makes fortythree hundred attack points. astral : *yuma*, you are forgetting something... yuma: oh, yeah. i also activate skill gainer's special ability. by using one overlay unit, it'll gain your magnedragon's powers. so thanks for bringing magnedragon to the party.  wolfsbane: this cannot be happening. magnedragon's special ability deals damage equal to the attack points of the monster it destroys. if i take eight hundred points of damage from battle, and then take thirtyfive hundred points of damage from the special ability.  wolfsbane: i'll be completely wiped out in a *single turn*. yuma: so how does it feel to know that your *trio* is gonna lose the duel, wolfsbane. jackal: we *ain't* losin'.  yuma: oh, no. jackal: if wolfsbane survives, we can still win.  jackal: ohhhhh....  jackal: whoaaaaaa. wolfsbane: no. jackal.  wolfsbane: i'm *out of here*.  anna: that's right, run away. you chicken. nistro: ha. he took off. we won't be seeing any more a' *that* creep. yuma: aw, yeah, wellwe woulda won it anyway.   mr. heartland: *no* one saw *this* coming. yuma tsukumojoined by two lastminute teammatesbeat the *terrifying* triad of terror..  flip: yahoo, yuma did it. kazwell: thatta boy, yuma. cathy: you guys were *amazing*. wolfsbane : thisis *not*over.. i *still* aim to finish the job, yuma.  nistro: so if i got this right, you're not even *in* the world duel carnival, anna. anna: not *exactly*... yuma: but'cha found someone who *was*, tied 'em up so they couldn't escape, and then *pretended to be 'em*. tori: gee, anna, that's kind of *extreme*. anna: yeah, well so what..  i guess, i, just... wanted to see you again. nistro: ahh. heads up, he's back, you guys..  yuma: it's magnedragon.... i was hoping we'd seen the last of it.  act 4 <<18:53 yuma: it's magnedragon.... i was hoping we'd seen the last of it. wolfsbane: you didn't think i'd take off without finishing the job, did you.. nistro: oh, no, brace yourselves. wolfsbane: i activate the spell "direct magnet" from my hand. by paying half my lifepoints, and cutting magnedragon's attack points in half, it can now attack you directly. take *this*.  anna: i summon construction train signal red.  anna: now magnedragon is forced to attack construction train instead of my *sweetiepie*, yuma.  yuma: anna..  yuma: anna...  wolfsbane: if my attack didn't damage you*ramming my coaster car into you will*... yuma: now, skill gainerattack..  wolfsbane: ahhaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh.  tori: oh, yeah. yuma: haha. anna: we beat 'em again.  yuma: that's right. and we couldn't've done it without you, anna. anna: mmhmhmhm.  *i believe in you*, yuma. you can win the whole carnival.  anna: don't prove me wrong.  anna: uh. ahah. uh. uh. ahh. nistro : i think she *likes you*, yuma. vetrix: yuma is powerful, indeed. but his reliance on the power of friendship will be his undoing.  mr. heartland: and now we go from the sunny skies of the skyscape section, to deep underground  mr. heartland : into the *dragon's den*. stay with us, duel fans. you won't want to miss a *second*.   yuma: i am sofeelin'the flow...  end
