and your number *will be hunted down*. act 4 <18:22>  kite and yuma: now let's duel.. kite: allow me to go first, *won't* you. i *draw*.  kite: first i activate the spell card "photon veil" from my hand. with this card, by returning three lightattribute monsters from my hand to my deck i can then *add* three lightattribute monsters from my deck to my hand.  yuma: so he gets to pick the monsters he wants. kite: next i'm gonna activate the power of the spell card "photon lead", which lets me summon one a' the monsters i just added to my hand in attack mode. <19:00>and the monster i summon, is daybreaker.  kite: but there's *more*. when this card is successfully summoned, i can summon *another* one from my hand.  kite: so that's *two* daybreakers. and now the *second* one's ability activates.  kite: so welcome to the field, *daybreaker number three*. yuma: three monsters, just like *that*. astral: oh, no.... and each one of them share the same level of four. yuma: oh, *just great*.  kite: i overlay my three levelfour daybreakers, to build the overlay network.  kite: i xyzsummonnumber ten, illumiknight.  <20:00>  astral: oh, my. yuma: no way. he brought out a number on his very first turn. kite: that's rightand guess whati'm *still* not done. because nowi play illumiknight's ability.  kite: with it, once per turn, i can use an overlay unit to discard one card from my hand, to draw one *new* card from my deck. then lightserpent's special ability activates. you see, when lightserpent is sent to the graveyard from my hand, it's then summoned to the field.   kite: next i'll bring out the monster plasma ball.   yuma: you kiddin' me. three monsters *again*.. this guy really oughta *pace himself out*. gonna be a long duel. astral: i fear astral: ...not at this rate. kite: i now overlay lightserpent and plasma ball.  <21:00> kite: and with that, i can once again build the overlay network. i xyzsummon, number twenty, gigabrilliant.   yuma: oh, boy. astral: he
