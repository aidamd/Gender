  act 1 <2:43>    yuma: i can't believe it*two* number monsters.. and this *number hunter* guy summoned 'em both in just *one turn*. man, that was quick. astral : whoever this fellow is, he is certainly a force to be reckoned with. *especially* since it seems <3:00> that even though he craves these number cards, he is not under their dark influence. kite: and now i *end my turn*. orbital : what a move. ending your turn. right on. kite : that's not a *move*, gearhead. orbital: oh. sosorry. my bad. yuma: well, here goesmy turn. i draw.  gogogo golem. all right. golem can't just take a *punch*, he can take *two*. ready. astral: mm. yuma: here's my moveone monster, facedown, in defense mode. kite: really. that's it. *fine*. it's my turn again, and first i'm going to do, *this*use illumiknight's ability.  kite: now, by using an overlay unit and discarding a card, *i*, can draw a card.  kite: all right thennow i play gigabrilliant's ability. by using one overlay unit, gigabrilliant gains three hundred attack points.  kite: and *now*, gigabrilliant attack. <4:00> take out yuma's facedown monster.    yuma: sorry, *hunter*. sure gigabrilliant has more attack points than golem, but golem has an ability that lets it survive an attack *once per turn*. kite: well, i guess, then, it's a very *good* thing that... *i have plenty more attacks where that one came from*. go, illumiknight. attack with shimmering sword slash.  yuma: ugh. not good. he was my *only monster*. now what. astral: now, you relax. there are no other monsters on his field he can attack you with. yuma: oh, yeah. i'm safe for now. kite: is *that* what you think. hm. you're a *very* long way away from being *safe*. yuma: ugh.... and lemme guess. now you're gonna show me why. kite: i tribute gigabrilliant and illumiknight. *goodbye*, you two. <5:00> and*hello*.  astral: hello. yuma: and just who exactly are we saying 'hello' to, may i ask. kite: herewhy don't you simply see for yourself.  yuma: ah. what's that..  yuma: ugh... i don't like the looks a' this. kite: say hello to, galaxyeyes photon dragon.   act 2 <5:47>  kite: get ready to meet defeat. 'cause my galaxyeyes photon dragon is ready to *seek and destroy*. yuma: whoa. 'seek and destroy'. <6:00> then *we* better be ready to *duck and cover*. astral: i *know* this creature.... kite: i end my turn. make your move. yuma: is there a move to *make*. utopia is the only card in my deck that stands a *chance* against that thing. but to summon utopia out, i need *two* monsters. so i guess i'd better gut busy.  all right, hunterhere i go. first i summongagaga magician.  yuma: and the magic's just startin'. next i play a spell carddo your thing, "monster slots".  yuma: ya see, with this card, by banishing a monster in my graveyard that's the same level as gagaga magician, i'm allowed to draw a card from my deck.  yuma: and if that card's the same *level* as gagaga, i'm allowed to summon it.  yuma: alrighty, here goesif i can draw a levelfour monster, i'm still in this. i'm feelin' the flow.. <7:00>  *draw*..  yuma: all right, i did it.. i got just what i needed. the levelfour... *ganbara knight*.  yuma: welcome to the game, ganbara.   yuma: and now that i have two levelfour monsters outandabout on my field, i'm gonna go ahead and *overlay* them. so whenever you're ready, guys yuma: all right. the overlay network *has been built*. now, i xyz summon yuma: number thirtynine, utopia..   yuma: i'm *countin'* on ya, utopia. kite: ah, the number has finally appeared.  mr. heartland: so, doctor faker, what do you think of my plan. dr. faker : a world duel carnival is *perfect*. <8:00> mr. heartland: i'm so pleased you approve. i'll get to work arranging for the tournament *at once*.  mr. heartland : i'll see to it all the *finest duelists* in heart land are there. and of *course*, more duelists from *all over the world*. duelists with *numbers*. dr. faker : *quite right*. mr. heartland: naturally, kite will participate. and then when he *wins the tournament*, all of those wonderful number cards will belong to *us*. dr. faker : yes, butwhat if kite should *lose*. what happens *then*, mister heartland. we should leave *nothing to chance*, for these number cards are of the *utmost importance*. mr. heartland: there's no need to *worry*, sir. *kite won't lose*. after all, his deck is *simply unbeatable*. our knowledge of the other world has seen to that. dr. faker: yes. a valid point. very well, thenit's settled. schedule this socalled *carnival* as soon as possible.  dr. faker: hahahaha. and the sooner the better, for i have a great many sphere field experiments to run. <9:00>  dr. faker: and this carnival of duels will be the perfect place to run them, because with this sphere i can draw out a number's power, and then by *using* that power...  dr. faker : hahahahahaha... nehahahahahaha... ahahahahahahaha.    hart: eheheheheh. yes, it's all working. *it's working*.. the energyis flowing, hahahahahahahaha.   dr. faker: well done, hart.. make astralworld *pay*. make them *pay* with your power..  <10:00> yuma: galaxyeyes has three thousand attack points. and utopia only has twentyfive hundred. but even so, i'm gonna attack. astral: are you mad.. yuma: maybe so, astral, but i'm hoping there's a method to my madness. guess we're about to find out, right here, right now. time to feel the flow. i activate the spell card, "blustering winds". thanks to this card, my utopia gains one thousand attack and defense points until my next turn.  yuma: all right, now utopia's the strongest monster on the field. kite: perhaps. well, why don't we go ahead and *battle* and find out. yuma: battle. that sounds good to me. let 'im have it, utopia.. kite: this is not going to be a very *pleasant sight*. yuma: got that right. you can close your eyes if you're *scared*. kite: not a pleasant sight*for you*.. yuma: say wha.. kite: you underestimated my dragon's power.. and now you'll pay the price. you see<11:00> when galaxyeyes battles your monster, *both* our monsters are banished.  yuma: no..... kite: your attempt to attack me failed *miserably*. what's your next move. yuma: ugh... i guess i'll just *end my turn* then. kite: i was hoping you'd say that, because now, you seegalaxyeyes' ability continues. and the monsters that were *banished* from play, *return to the field*.  yuma: utopia. you *weren't* destroyed. all right. with my utopia back, i am *still in this duel*. kite: little fool. still, you simply do not understand. if the monster that galaxyeyes banished from play was an xyz monster, galaxy *absorbs* that monster's overlay units, *and* gains five hundred attack points for each one.  astral: oh no.... yuma: utopia's overlay units are *gone*.. kite: indeed they are, <12:00> *both* of them, so if you do the mathgalaxyeyes gains one thousand attack points.  astral: four thousand attack points.... yuma: that's not good. that's enough to take out *all* my lifepoints. orbital: thathat's *right*. at then your number cacard and your soul go *byebye*. yuma: my *soul*. wait a minute...  yuma : is that what happened back at the mall.  yuma: he looked like that because he lost his *soul*.  kite: you tin twit. i've already got this kid on the ropes, and you bring *that up*.. what is *wrong* with you...  orbital: sorsorry. won't happen aggain. yuma: what's all this about souls.. tell me. kite: i suppose there's no point keeping it a secret *now*. so okay.  kite : my method for taking a number is somewhat *forceful*.  kite : *so* forceful, in fact, that when i *take it*...  kite: that individual's *soul*is taken as well.  <13:00> yuma: whaddayou mean, 'taken'. where does it *go*. kite: don't know. and come to think of it, i really don't care.  yuma: don't *care*. astral: but *you* had better care, yuma. otherwise we are *both* donefor. act 3 <13:12> yuma: ugh. that guy's got the upper hand, so i think i'd better just place one card facedown and end my turn. kite: all right, thenit's *my move*. now, galaxyeyes, let 'im have it. photon stream of destruction..  kite: even though only a number can destroy a number, you're *still gonna take damage*.  kite: next i'm gonna play *this*the spell card "photon wind". and it'll be *knocking* the wind *out of you*. because when i deal damage without destroying your monsteryou take an additional one thousand points of damage.  yuma: aaaagghhh. astral: so.... he was *planning* on not destroying yuma's number card. <14:00>  kite: and that's not *all* my photon wind lets me do. now, i get to draw a card. and then i'll place onefacedown.  kite: and with that, i'll end my turn.  yuma: astral. astral: as your lifepoints diminish, my life *force* does with it. kite: i have you right in the palm of my hand. can you *feel* the crush of defeat closing in.  yuma: it's my move.  astral: yuma.....  yuma : come on. what're you waiting for.  aahh....  *do it*..  here goes. i *draw*.  yuma : but even if the luck of the draw is with me, that may *not be enough*. after alli was able to bring out my very best card utopia, and it didn't help me at all. but wait. *only a number can destroy a number*. <15:00> and his monster isn't a number. so maybe i *wasn't* having utopia help me in the right *way*. maybe i need to put him in defense mode. astral: a risky move. yuma: huh. astral: he went so far as to get rid of his *number cards* so he could summon galaxyeyes. he is *sure* to have a plan in place for you playing a number in defense. yuma: so what do i do.. astral: the only thing you *can* do in a moment like thisyou *hunt the hunter*. yuma: you mean *keep attacking*, hoping that something will *work*.. but if it doesn't we're *both donefor*. astral: that is true. but i would rather go out with a bang than a whimper. yuma: rgh... astral: do you feel the same. yuma: of course. so let's get to it. astral: well all right, then. now the only question *is*, what is our next move going to be. yuma: i don't know. with so much on the line, my *head is swirling*. i can hardly think straight. astral: then think back to a time *like* this. a time with a lot on the line. how did you get through it.  <16:00>  fb kazuma: feel the flow, sonand climb.  yuma: astral, my head's clear. i know exactly what i need to do to turn things around. astral : hm.  yuma: i need to feel the flow... i now summon out zubaba knight..  zubaba knight: zubaba *knight*. yuma: next i activate "copy knight".  yuma: this trap copies my monster, so now i have *two* zubaba knights.  duplicate zubaba knight: zubaba *knight*. yuma: next i'll *overlay* them both, so that i can create *this*an overlay network.  yuma: and with it, i can now xyzsummon. <17:00> so come on out, number seventeen, leviathan dragon.   orbital: didid he say *number*.  orbital: yep. it's confirmed. master kite.. iit's *another number monster*.  kite: so then you have *two*, eh. i wonder, does that mean that *you're* a number hunter as well. i sure hope so, and do you know why. because then you'll have all the more for me to snatch. yuma: yeah, we'll see about *that*. i play leviathan's ability.  yuma: by using an overlay unit, leviathan dragon gains five hundred attack points. kite: so what. even *with* that boost, galaxyeyes remains the stronger beast. yuma: oh, i don't *care* about who's strongest. and *here's why*. the spell card, "cross attack". when i have two monsters with the same attack points, one of them can't attack<18:00> *but*, the other one can attack you directly. and thanks to that boost, utopia *and leviathan* now have the same attack points.  yuma: so *let loose*, utopia. attack him directly. kite: *so* predictable. yuma: go, rising sun slash. kite: you didn't think i'd let a simple *spell card* defeat me. because it *won't be*.  kite: and now allow me to show you *why*.  kite: allow me to play the trap, "lumenize". now your utopia's attack is negated, and galaxyeyes photon dragon *gains* its attack points.  yuma: so galaxyeyes is even *stronger* now.. kite: heheheheh, that's rightto the tune of sixtyfive hundred. astral: just stay calm. yuma: but we're donefor. astral: no, we are not. yuma: so, what now. <19:00> astral: i will tell you what. we make the only move left *to* make. yuma: yeah, okay*what is it*. astral: place the trap in your hand facedown. yuma: what, ya mean *this*. "mirror mail".... but how will *that* help. *unless*... astral: that is right. with mirror mail, when your opponent wages battle, mirror mail will change utopia's attack points, so that it *equals* those of galaxyeyes.  yuma: oh, *wow*.  yuma : and even though our monsters' attack points would be the same, a number can only be destroyed by a number.  yuma : which means galaxyeyes would be destroyed, but *not utopia*.  yuma: that's it, astral. that's how we'll win. astral: then let us get to it. yuma: don't have to tell *me* twice. i play a facedownand end my turn.  dr. faker: you're doing great, hart.. *use* your power. use all you can.    kite: my turn. i draw. yuma : bring it.  astral : do it. attack.  kite: i summon forth, photon cerberus.  kite: and when cerberus is let off its leash, your trap cards are put *on it*.  astral: oh no. yuma: so then mirror mail won't be able to activate.. kite: that's rightwhich means your lastditch effort to beat me, has failed, and you're now *all out of moves*.  astral: *he knew*. somehow, he *knew*. he has outdueled us both. kite: and now your soul and number cards*will be mine*. galaxyeyes photon dragon. prepare to attack.  yuma: aahh...  *is this it*..  astral: ... i'm afraid so. farewell. yuma: ohh.... <21:00> ah...  act 4 <21:04>  kite: galaxyeyes photon dragon.  kite: prepare to attack.  hart: big brother... kite: go, photon stream of huh.. orbital: iincoming message. master kikite.  kite: *hart*..  we'll finish this later. but now kite: i must leave.  come on. we must hurry. orbital: then llet's roll.   tori: did i just *miss something*. yuma: ... yeah, me getting schooled. tori: hm.  yuma: now i know, when the stakes are high and everything's on the line... i *don't* have what it takes, even when i feel the flow.  yuma: it's on me, astral. not you. *i* let us down. *me*..  end <22:37> * special thanks to hulu.com and toonzaki.com for making this episode accessible online. * special thanks to yugioh wikia as a source for checking cards. * special thanks to kazuki takahashi, 4kids, et al. for yugioh. zexal. last updated: may 22, 2013 i don't own yugioh zexal, at all, and this transcript is unofficial and without any permission whatsoever. please link back to me if you use my work. for more information about my transcript format, please click here. read my commentary on this episode here )
