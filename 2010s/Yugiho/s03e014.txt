 cathy: cheers, yuma. you're the cat's meow.  flip: he's a great duelist, too. bronk: and *semifinalist*. kazwell: we're sure, you're gonna be the carnival champion.  tori: *i'm* not sure. all: yeah, yuma.  bronk: you're aokay with us. yuma: thanks. you guys are my favorite fans.  flip: he's a *dueling dynamo*. cathy: and the *cutest* competitor, too.  yuma: what's the matter, tori. don't feel like celebrating.  cathy: i bet tori's still *ticked off* at *you*.  cathy : she'll *never forgive you* for deserting her in that desert,  even though she *probably deserved it*.  tori: *cathy*.. cathy : *meow*.  yuma: i'm sorry i forgotcha, but i was focused on important stu tori: so i'm *not important*, huh..  lillybot: eat this, yuma. it will keep you quiet and out of trouble.  grandma: of course, if you kids aren't hungry, you can always eat later.  yuma: no, we'll eat now, grandma.  bronk: this looks *scrumalicious*. kazwell: as usual. grandma: dig in. i don't want *any leftovers*. yuma: yes, ma'am. flip: oh boy.  tori: heywaitgrandma: *aaaaaaaaggghhhh...*  yuma: butyou *told* us to dig in. grandma : after we give thanks for our food, of course.  yuma: let's hear it for grandma. everyone else: thanks for this fabulous feast.  bronk: *eat up*, yuma. you'll need all the energy you can *get* for your next duel.  kazwell: you'll be facing shark or kite or vetrix. yuma: ha. they'll have as much chance against me as this *meatball*.  cathy: yuma's really feelin' the flow..  tori: yeah, but he *barely* won some of his duels before... yuma: i didn't wanna make it look *too easy*.  astral : whoever yuma's opponent is, this next duel will surely be his most challenging ever.  astral : whether he faces vetrix, with his crest and numbers...  astral : ...or kite, and his powerful neo galaxyeyes.  astral: but perhaps *shark*...  astral : ...who, in the end, may prove to be the most dangerous of them all, because of his chaos number.  astral : i wonder how he acquired it.   yuma: i'll polish off *anybody* who stands in my way.  yuma: i can't wait to pull out my deck, and start dueling again.  astral : no matter *who* he faces, yuma will need to keep his cool... yuma: *hey*. where's my deck..  bronk: huh..  yuma: i *know* i had it on me but *now it's gone*. ah. *i've lost my deeeeeeck..* act <<2:14  tori: mmmrgh, how could you lose your *deck*. you're so irresponsible. yuma: it's not my fault. some card thief must've picked my pocket.  tori: well you think *you* can track it down.  kazwell: yup. fortunately, the locator chip in yuma's deck case is functioning properly. according to the tracking app on my dueltab, yuma's deck is in the middle of heart land city.  bronk: only one small problem. eh, make that *not* so small. yuma: since i'm a finalist, i have v.i.p. access.  yuma: hey, open up, it's me. *yuma tsukumo*.  come on, guys, i'm really desperate..  don't embarrass me in front of my entourage..  all right, that's it.  yuma: gimme a breeeeeak.. there must be a secret password they forgot to tell me. i'll get past this entrance somehoweven if i have to *jump* over. tori: unless he's got a *jet pack*, *forget* it. yuma: oh yeah. well i've got something *better* than a jet pack. it's called *superhuman athletic ability*. hah.  astral: *yuma*...   yuma: it *worked*.  yuma: don't worry. i've got an even better plan.  tori : we've had enough of your plans for one day, thank you.  can't you see it's *impossible* to get into heart land.  tori: ...impossible unless you're driving a *truck*, that is. kazwell: oh yeah. those garbage trucks take the litterbots and the trash they collected to the recycle center each night. flip : *i* got an ideaand it *totally stinks*.   tori: ugh. there's no *way* i'm getting inside one of those. flip: but, it's the only chance. these garbage cans will get trucked into heart land *tonight*. all ya gotta *do* is *hitch a ride*. yuma: flip, you're a genius. flip: thanks, and *good luck*. ciao. bronk: where ya goin' flip. flip: i gotta go feed my alligator.  bronk: hey, get back here. ya little sneak. yuma: aah, well.  let's get hiding.  tori: butyumakazwell: wow. he's really going through with it.  tori: we can't let 'im go *alone*. you go, too, bronk. bronk: *me*.. jump in a stinky *trashcan*.. tori: it's gross, but no worse than your *gym locker*. bronk : gee, *thanks*... cathy: now *hold on*. there's *still* one free can.  and *you can't call it*, tori. tori: huh.  trust me, i have no intention of climbing into that can, cathy. cathy : oh sure, you *say* you're not going with yuma. but you always end *up* with him. even though *i'd* be much more *helpful*. tori: mmmgghhh.  bronk: now, girls. i would be *more* than happy to give up *my* place.  tori: i knowlet's play rockpaperscissors. cathy: finethe winner goes with yuma... and, what'shisname. bronk: hey. cathy and tori: rock, paper, scissors, *go*.  cathy and tori: again.  cathy and tori: again.  cathy and tori: again.  astral : i have seen many strange human rituals... cathy and tori : again.  again.  again.  cathy and tori : again. *again.* astral  ...but this is the most *bewildering* of all. cathy and tori: *again.*  tori: yeah.. paper covers rock. cathy: rrrgghhh. tori : i'm going in the trash c.  tori : oh, *yuck*...  yuma: quickbefore the *bots* come. bronk: ohh, epic fail...   litterbot: extract all waste products from receptacles. extract all waste products from receptacles.  yuma: yah. tori: yee. bronk: ugh. litterbot: toxic waste detected.  yuma: ugh...  hey. wait up. ya can't leave litter lyin' around like that. i'm just as good as the *rest* a' the garbage.  act <<6:09  vetrix: excellent. everything is unfolding like i planned. by tomorrow, i can begin the final phase.  vetrix: and *all the numbers* will *soon belong to me*. it's true. i *was* forced to use trey, quatro, and quinton to reach my goal...  vetrix : but i had no other *choice*.  vetrix : my sons gave up *everything* to serve my plans, but now that they're out of commission, i'm turning *elsewhere* for help.  vetrix: heheheheheheheh.  shark : i'm comin' for you, vetrix.  vetrix: i've been *expecting* you. welcome.  shark: *you*..  shark: enough games. come on out.  vetrix: that was *too easy*. i'm *disappointed* in you, shark.  vetrix: but that will be the last time *that* happens. as you know, a seed of darkness was placed in your heart during your duel with trey.  vetrix: you thought you had *overcome* this darkness, but you were wrong. the seed will grow 'till it seizes control of you. then you'll use its darkness to destroy your next opponentyuma.   shark: uugghh...uuuaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh.   litterbots: trash identified, trash identified, trash identified...   dr. faker: at long lastthe son of kazuma tsukumo. tori: uuuugghhh. thanks, i feel *totally grungy* now. yuma: at least the worst part is *over*, right. uh.  yuma: aah.  yuma: ohh. get movin'.  yuma: go fasterrrr. wah.  astral: yuma..  tori: uh... wait, we're okay. huh. hey tori: there's an exit. let's get out of here before this belt starts up again.  bronk: next time i think i'll *skip* *that* ride. yep. yuma: look at all that *junk*.  yuma: who knew this city produced so much trash. bronk: yeah... and it all gets dumped in a big *pit*. tori: incredible... yuma: there's *tons a' garbage* spillin' out every secondthat pit must be almost *bottomless*.   astral : that *vision*it's of astralworld. i sense something strange about this place.    astral: yuma... yuma: huh. astral: hart is right above us. yuma: huh. ah.... we *have to go find him*..  act <<9:59  tori : goodthe coast is clear. bronk : you sure you wanna go through with this. yuma : i am. come on.  yuma : gotta find hart. i need to tell 'im something.  yuma: what's that.  tori: some kind of fancy *elevator*, i think. maybe it will lead us up to hart.  yuma: only one way to find out.  yuma: huh. robot: intruder alert. intruder alert. intruder alert.  robot: eliminate the intruders. switch over to duel mode. tori: wait... it wants to duel us. yuma: okay, let's *take it* to this mechanical creep.  computer: augmented reality vision link established. yuma, bronk, tori: let's duel.  yuma: uhoh. is this gonna be a *math* duel. bronk: let's *hope* not... tori:  hey, guys...  tori: are these the cards we're expected to use.  yuma: if they *are*, i'm not sure how we can even *summon* them. bronk: yeah, especially since they're all *xyz* monsters. robot: initiate summoning software. summon scrap recycler.  yuma: another robot. how're we s'posed to *battle* it.. bronk: heyi got an idea. let's try an' xyz summon by usin' the number pads.  bronk: hey, tori. hop onto that 'three' key in front a' ya. tori: i don't see how playing hopscotch will *help*but bronk: now, since we lit up two levelthree keys, all try an xyz summon. don't let me down, windup zenmaines.  yuma: that's an xyz monster, all right. tori: yaaaaayyy.. bronk: all right, zenmaines, it's time to *zap away*. get rid a' that recycler.  bronk: *excellent*. robot: summoning scrap searcher.  bronk: man. this duel just got *real ugly*. yuma, scramwhile we give 'im a *makeover*. yuma: huh. bronk: don't argue. *go*. yuma: but bronk, itori: listen, hart needs your help more than we do. we'll distract these bots while *you* find 'im. yuma: all rightgood luck, guys.  astral: faster.  yuma: aaaahhh. bronk: hey. colossocop, turn around.  bronk: we aren't done pulverizin' ya. toripress two more levelone keys.  tori: two levelones... there, and *there*.  bronk: i'll use all three level ones to summon mira the starbearer.  bronk: mira. scrap that scrap searcher.  yuma: yeah. way to go, bronk. robot: summoning monster, scrap hunter.  bronk: lunge for a number two, tori. tori: sure thing..  bronk: *light it up*, shining elf.   yuma: i'll be back, guysafter i track down hart.  robot: summoning, scrap shark.   tori: we're all set. bronk: come on out, evigishki merrowgeist.  robot: summoning out scrap golem. bronk and tori: aaahh.  bronk: gghno *way*..  yuma: hart. he's asleep... just like he was before, with quinton...  fb kite: don't hurt him...  fb kite: hart....   astral: i do not believe he is simply sleeping. it would appear that hart has remained unconscious this entire time.  yuma: hartit's me, yuma. i survived, and i'm still competing in the duel carnival.  yuma: i wanted to see you, so i could give you my promise that i'll defeat vetrix and win the carnival. i'm hoping to face your brother kite in the *final* duel. and if i do, i'm sure it's gonna be the most awesome battle ever. ... and... and there's *one more thing* i wanted to tell you. hart...  yuma: i'm sorry. i should never have let quinton take you away. what happened to you is *my* fault.  hart: yuma.... can you hear me. yuma.  astral: fascinating. hart: yuma. astral.  hart: hi, yuma. i felt in my heart that you could come here to visit me, and i was right. yuma: i can't believe it.  i'm glad to see you, hart. hart: i have a favor to ask. will you please save my big brother, kite. yuma: huh.  hart: my brother is growing weaker all the *time*. i want to save him, but it's *impossible*. i don't have the power. i... can't *leave* this place, yuma. that's why... i need *you* to save 'im for me.  yuma: wait, don't go.   yuma: where *were* we.... astral: inside hart's mind. yuma: but how could *that* be. astral: simply putalthough hart seems unconscious, his mind is *actually* quite active. if we could free hart from his present state, there is a chance he could return to normal. yuma: what do we have to do to free him.. astral: i am not sure. but remember that kite has claimed that he collects numbers to save his younger brother.  yuma: that's right... what'm i gonna do. agh. if i collect all the numbers, hart may never be saved. but if he *is* saved, hart will *destroy astralworld*. aagghh. what'm i supposed to *do*, astral.. astral: ... *you* are the one who must battle. the decision is yours alone. yuma: hm. you really believe i can decide something *so important*. astral: yes, i do.  astral : it's been an honor for me to duel alongside you, yuma.  astral : to my great surprise, *i* have learned much from *you* during our time together...  astral : and the most important thing of all is that *i can trust your judgment*.  astral: whichever path you decide on, i will accept it... i know you will do what you believe is best. yuma: thanks, astral... that means a lot to me. but that *really didn't help me at all*.. it would be a lot better if ya *told me what to do*. just tell me that i should get the numbers for you and your missionif you do that, then i won't be forced to choose at all. i don't understand why you're leaving all this up to *me*.  dr. faker: hahahaha. welcome to my domain, yuma tsukumo. i am the notorious genius, doctor faker. act 4 <<17:34 dr. faker: i am the notorious genius, doctor faker. yuma: *you're* doctor faker. i've heard of you. you're kite and hart's father.  dr. faker: that's right. what a pleasure to meet the son of kazuma tsukumo.  dr. faker: and your associatethe original number.  yuma: astralif he knows you're hereastral: then, clearly, he can see me. so tell me, doctor. why are you trying to collect numbers. i need them to *restore my memory*. dr. faker: it was all part of the agreement that i made with barianworld. astral: what do *you* know of barian.  dr. faker : i know that it is a distant world that is *quite* hostile to your own astralworld. dr. faker: i agreed to destroy astralworld for the barians. in exchange, i will receive unimaginable power. then i can conquer the earth and rule over it. yuma: that's sick. you forced kite to become a number hunter just so you could get power.. kite and hart are both *suffering* because of you. how could you treat your own kids this way. dr. faker: their fate was necessary. yuma: necessary. dr. faker: my sons wellbeing means *nothing* when compared to the power within my grasp. i'll willingly sell out *anyone* to gain such powerlike i did with your own father, kazuma..  dr. faker: a *true genius* like me cannot allow lesser creatures to stand in my way. yuma: you're still gonna have to get past *me*. dr. faker: that will be easy. you're destined for destruction, yuma. the same way astralworld is doomed.  dr. faker: thanks for dropping innow drop *out*.  yuma: whaaa.   yuma : at least we *sorta* made a soft landing....  yuma: whoa, my deck. bronk : shoulda worn a helmet... tori: yuma, next time you lose your deck, go find it on your own..  yuma: doctor faker....  mr. heartland: it's gonna be a dynamic day, duel devotees, as we prepare to launch the thrilling world duel carnival semifinal.  mr. heartland: we're down to our final four. the survivors of the duel coaster will now face off to see who becomes the first world duel carnival champ.  mr. heartland: this stadium is about to get hotter than a *barbecue grill*, as vetrix goes toetotoe against kite, and shark aims his sights on yuma.   yuma: i can do this, astral. i'll find a way to take the top prize *and* at the same time help you and all my friends who're counting on me. astral: yes.  yuma: come on. let's highfive the sky.. end <<20:19 * special thanks to animeratio.com for the copy of
