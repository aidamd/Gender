 kite : hey, hartlook. i brought your favorite, little brother, hot chocolate.  kite: go on, take a sip.  hart: but where... are we. kite: don't you recognize this cottage.  kite: think backwe lived here when we were growing up. hart: we did. ugh... i can't remember. kite: well, *i* remember how much happier you were back then.  kite: *nothing* could get you down. you were always laughing, and telling jokes...  kite: but something *happened*, kid. you changed.  kite: and i know *who* did this to you.   mr. heartland: *oh*. so sorry to interrupt this *brotherly reunion*. but i'm afraid it's time for *hart* to get back to work. <1:00> kite : he needs to *rest*. you're pushing hart *way too far*. don't you see, you have to take it *easy* on him.  mr. heartland: that *may be*. all the same, doctor faker *insists* that hart keep working. kite: he *won't*.. hart: stay *out of this*, kite.  hart: this mission is way too important for me to give up *now*. kite: but hart... hart: don't *worry* about me.  hart: i'm the *only one* with the power to save our world, kite.  i wanna do whatever i can to help.  kite : i know.  mr. heartland: it's settled, then. doctor faker will be *thrilled* to know you're back on the job, hart.  mr. heartland: and i'm sure *kite* will get back to work tracking down the numbers we need. isn't that right. you *do* want your brother to get *better*, don't you.   act 1 <2:54>  yuma: whoa, too cool..  yuma: ow, *that* wasn't too cool.  <3:00> yuma: uagh. you're sayin' there's a *fullsize airship* parked inside my key.. astral: correct. yuma: oh...  yuma: that must be *one tight squeeze*. astral: clearly that key comes from a place far different from *this* world.  astral: when your parents gave it to you, they may've realized it contained many mysteries. yuma: cool. so how do we get the ship *outta* the key. astral: i do not know...  astral : you see the airship has been constructed like a gigantic puzzle. i am convinced that the numbers we've been gathering are the secret to *solving* this puzzle.  astral: if we succeed in gathering up *all of them*... then *we shall see*.  yuma: numbers, huh....   kite: get it in gear, orbital sevenwe're goin' numberhunting again.  kite: hey, you lazy hunk a' junk, wake up. <4:00>  kite: i said *wake up*..  orbital: aaaaaahh. i, i wasn't sleeping.  orbital: just resting my ssensors. kite: yeah, *right*. have you finished up that report yet, listing all the duelists who have number cards.  orbital: aaaahh... i kinda forgot. kite : your memory circuits must be failing. maybe it's time i traded you in for a *newer model*.  orbital: pplease don't do that.. i'll whip up that report in a flash, you'll ssee. i, i promisekite: while you're at it, find me the *original* number. orbital: ththe *original*. kite: yes. doctor faker says there was an *original* visitor who brought the numbers to this planet. i suspect... this mysterious visitor may've found a host in heart land city. orbital: a hhhhhost. aaaaaahh. i think i have it.. remember that bboy *yuma* you challenged. i, i noticed something during your duel.  orbital: he was wearing a *strange ppendant*. i'm running a computer analysis nownow.  kite: what does it say. orbital: it conconfirms that the pendant did *not come* from this plaplanet. kite: really. <5:00>  kite : orbital, locate yuma and gather as much information on him as you can.  kite: and *please* do not make me ask you twice.  orbital: i'm on it, boboss. kite : our next duel will be yuma's *last*. act 2 <5:15>  yuma: outta my way.. comin' through.  yuma: i'm gonna be late for swimming class *again*.  shark: that yuma. always runnin' behind... mr. kay: hi there, shark. shark: huh.  mr. kay: i'm glad to see that you decided to come back to *school*...  mr. kay: so was yuma the one who helped to change your mind.  mr. kay: he certainly does seem to have a talent for influencing others.  mr. kay : i can't explain why. maybe it's his positive attitude.  mr. kay : but, something about yuma brings out the best in people...  mr. kay: wouldn't you agree with that, shark.  shark: whatever.  you think yuma will bellyflop off the high dive again. tori: who knows. he never *learns*.  tori: *tell* me about it. kazwell: *back off* from the pool, yuma. <6:00> yuma: but, i wanna dive.  kazwell: not while you're endangering the *rest* of us..  kazwell: *take that thing off*..  yuma: why should i..  kazwell: *it* is a safety hazard. *lose it or move it..* yuma: you're bein' ridiculous.  cathy: i agree with *yuma*...  tori: i hate to side with kazwell here, but, remember your *highdive* last week. you really *stuck that landing*....  *get me*.  yuma: huh. stuck it. i totally bellyflopped.  kazwell: ya stuck that thing *right here*..  yuma: *man*. like it's *my* fault kazwell's *head* got in the way... i *should* be more careful with this key, though. not only is it incredibly valuable and mysterious yuma: but it's sort of like astral's *home*, too.   shark: maybe i *can* learn something from yuma... huh.   orbital: i feel so *trashy* in this disguise.  orbital: thathat locker room should be around here *somewhere*...  astral: numbers hold the secret, to this ship and also...  astral: ...to my memories. we have ten number cards so far.  astral : some have left me with more *questions* than answers.  astral: and that truly concerns me. my memory is weak...  astral: i will need even more number cards if i am going to solve the mysteries that surround me.  orbital: this *must* bbe the locker room. i can ttell by the *odor*... now, which locker is yuyuma's.  orbital: ttarget identified.  orbital: sosorry, but, *finders keepers*.  orbital: that, that was *too easy*.  orbital: daaaahh.  shark: this doesn't belong to you. orbital: i, i was just, uh, borrowing it, from my <8:00> *ggood buddy yuma*. give it back or he'll be mad..  shark: i think you're a lying *thief*.  orbital: ugh.  orbital: that was a big mistake. i look puny outside, bbut inside i pack a lot of dangerous surprises.  orbital: now hand it over, shorty. or i'll start *drilling* for it. shark: what kinda robot *are* you..  orbital: the *nasty* kind..   orbital: come back here, coward..  astral: how odd. why is it stopping.  astral: the numbers are disengaging... ah...  astral: why is this occurring. i sense something is wrong.  <9:00>  orbital: *i want that pendant*....  kite: that's *enough*, orbital.  kite: i didn't authorize an attack.  orbital : i *never* have fun... kite: why don't you do yourself a favor and hand that pendant over to me *right now*.  shark: not a chance. this thing isn't yours, pal.  kite: i know. it belongs to yuma tsukumo. shark: and how *d'you* know yuma. kite: well. let's just say his number cards drew my interest. shark: ohi get it. you must be that *number hunter* i've been hearin' about. kite: so, tell me. are you a *duelist*. do *you* have any number cards in your possession.  shark: there's *one* way to find out. kite: exactly what *i* was thinking. i'll take your number *and* that pendant. this match'll be for doubleor nothing.  shark : i was totally headin' for trouble...  shark : ...'til yuma pulled me back from the brink. i owe 'im *bigtime*. and today, i'm payin' 'im back.   shark: okay, hunterbring it.  kite: photon transformation, *go*. hah.  shark: duel disk locked, and ready for action. hnhnh. yeah.  shark: duel gazer, go.  kite: huhuh. prepare to meet defeat.  computer: augmented reality vision link established.  shark and kite: let's duel.. act 3 <10:48>  security, report to the field house.  tori: freaky. cathy: yeah, *super* freaky.  bronk: looks like a war zone. kazwell: whoever pulled this prank is in for some *serious* detention time. <11:00>  yuma: i can't find it. it's not here.  yuma: my key is gone.  shark: ready. i'll go first. let's do this. i draw.   shark : since this guy hunts numbers, i bet he's gonna build his *whole strategy* around 'em. but i've got a plan that should zero *out* his numbers.  shark: to starti'll send big jaws to the graveyard, and activate the "shark lair" spell card.  shark: with this in play, your monsters that have equal or less attack points than the monster i sent to the graveyard can no longer attack. and big jaws has a whopping eighteen*hundred* attack points. good luck summoning a monster with more attack points than *that*. next upi summon shocktopus.   shark: then i'll end my turn with a facedown.  shark : c'mon, hunter. use a number.  kite: watch and learn from a *real* duelist.  <12:00> kite: i *draw*. first i activate, "polymerization". shark: a spell card.. kite: yes, that's right. and next i'm gonna use its power to fuse these two photon lizards.  kite: so that i can summon *twin* photon lizard to my field.   kite: as you can see, my monster is way more powerful than your big jaws. shark : i *didn't* count on 'im not going straight for an xyz summon. looks like i'll have to play at the top a' my game to outduel *this* guy. kite: with twin photon lizard out, your shark lair spell card can't protect you anymore.  kite: your pathetic *strategy* failed miserably. now. twin photon lizard, attack. go, photon force..  shark: i didn't fail *anything*. i activate shocktopus's special ability. now shocktopus equips onto twin photon lizard, <13:00> and sucks out its strength. your lizard not only loses all its attack points, but it can't change *battle mode* anymore either.  shark: ya see that. it doesn't matter *what* you try to throw my way, i'm always one step ahead. you played me, but i played you *right back*. next turn, i'm gonna take a *serious bite* outta your lifepoints.  orbital: well, *what *. that twerp's knocked you *ddown*. kite: i can counter that move *easily*. shark: oh, yeah. kite: i activate twin photon lizard's special ability. now *twin photon lizard* splits back into *two* photon lizards.   shark : his levelthree monsters're back. this can only mean one thing. kite: i overlay my levelthree photon lizards, in order to build the overlay network.  kite: i xyz summon, number thirty. acid golem of destruction.   shark : i was *hoping* he'd use a number. and *this* one has three thousand attack points.  shark : it's the perfect moment to spring my trap.  i activate, "splash capture". since you xyz summoned, if i take two fishtype monsters from my graveyard and banish 'em from play, *i* get control of your xyz monster. so now i banish both big jaws and shocktopus. you are *so predictable*. i was *positive* you'd summon one a' your numbers, and i was right. my trap worked like a charm.  shark: you thought acid golem would devastate my deck, but i just turned it *against* you. act 4 <15:00> number hunter, i now control your acid golem, *and* all of its power. once it strikes, you're *through*. orbital : master kite. you should've let me take care of 'im *before*.  kite : stay out of this, orbital.  orbital: ... if you insist... kite: it's my move. i activate the spell, "forced release". now acid golem loses all of its overlay units.  kite: then i place one card facedown, and end my turn. shark: hunh. that spell of yours didn't get you out of danger. acid golem still has three thousand attack points.  and *i can't wait to use 'em*. kite: you fool. don't you realize acid golem is still going to help me win this.. shark: help *you*.  kite: even though you control it *now*, acid golem is *still* doing my dirtywork. <16:00> it might have three thousand attack points, but its huge strength is balanced out by great *weaknesses*.  shark: yeah. like *what*. kite: here's *one* thing. it must use an overlay unit each one of your turns, or you take damage. *two thousand lifepoints*, to be exact.  shark: hold on. you're forgetting *one thing*, number hunter. *it can still attack*, now *go*, acid golem.. start blasting away. kite: it *can't*. shark: why not.. kite: because acid golem needs *overlay units* in order to attack. shark: so it's *powerless* now.... kite: you were doomed from the *start*. since i was *expecting* you to try and take control of my number, i set you up. shark: guess *i'm* the one who fell into a trap, then.  that number hunter knows his stuff. underestimating him was careless. this duel's *done* if i don't think a' somethin' *fast*.  shark : but, *what*.. it seems *hopeless*... huh.  shark : wait<17:00> *yuma* wouldn't give up. and neither will i.  shark: i play a facedown and end my turn. you're up. kite: and you're goin' *down'*. i draw.   shark : i *still have a chance*. with my facedown card "life regeneration", i won't take damage from acid golem's special ability on my next turn. that should buy me some time 'til i can figure out how to *beat this guy*. kite: i'm activating, the spell "photon sublimation". so by banishing two photon monsters, i can draw two more cards. and that is bad news for you and your lifepoints. and now i *draw*..  heh. i specialsummon, photon thrasher.   kite: and next i summon, photon crusher.   kite: butneither one is hanging around, because i have something bigger and badder in mind. prepare yourself. <18:00>  shark: waitwhat're you *doing*.. kite: *just watch*.. this next monster can only be summoned by tributing *two* monsters with two thousand or more attack points.  kite: it's quite *large*. you might even sayastronomical...  kite: once *this* monster attacks, yuma's pendant and your number will both be mine.  shark: oh... oh no.  kite: say hello togalaxyeyes photon dragon..    yuma: come on, astral, where are you..  yuma: huh.. oh, man.  yuma: *that* wasn't in today's weather forecast.  kazwell : i've never seen a storm like it before... yuma: i wonder if it's....  tori: hey.  astral: something is happening, in the world outside this key... what... *is* this.  deep voice: the hour for action is approaching. <19:00> light voice: approaching, approaching... deep voice: you need the power of zexal. light voice: zexal, power...  deep voice: the power that changes all darkness into light. the power of zexal.  light voice : zexal...  shark: there *must* be some way out. c'mon. think. kite: it's *all over*. go, photon stream of destruction..  shark: hold up. why're you attacking with *that* monster..  shark: it's impossiblegalaxyeyes *isn't a number card*. only a number can destroy a number.  kite: wrong again. once acid golem loses its overlay units, that rule *no longer applies*. that's why galaxyeyes was free to destroy it. shark: rrrgghh.... in that case, you just made a giant tactical blunder, didn't you.. with acid golem on the field, i would've taken massive damage. by destroying it, you saved me from 'is curse and kept me in the duel. <20:00> kite: you've already lost. shark: how's that. kite: because you're still under acid golem's curse. when it's destroyed, the duelist controlling it takes two thousand points of damage, which means your number card belongs to *me* now, along with yuma's pendant.  shark: that can't be.  shark: please, forgive me, yuma...  kite: i'll take that number, now... along with your *soul*, as well.  kite: i don't understand this.... <21:00> there *is* no number. yuma: shark..  kite: hello, yuma. yuma: long time no see, kite.  yuma: shark.  yuma: he's really hurt. what've you done.. orbital : master kikite, the photon mode is eightyfive ppercent. nno more dueling, *please*, it's titime to move out.  kite: relax, we're leaving.  yuma: hey, leave that aloneit's mine.  yuma: oh, nohe's got astral.... *kite, come back here..*  end <21:44> * special thanks to animeratio.com for the copy of this episode transcribed online. * special thanks to yugioh wikia as a source for checking cards. * special thanks to
