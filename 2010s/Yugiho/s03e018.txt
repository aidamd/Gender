this ends *now*, vetrix.. act 3 <<11:06  kite: this ends *now*, vetrix..  orbital: we're all rootin' for ya, master kikite. yuma: yeah, that's right. show vetrix what dueling's all about. kite: oh, i intend to. it's my turn, i *draw*.. i activate the spell card "galaxy expedition". when galaxyeyes is on my field, i can summon one galaxy knight from my deck.  kite: galaxy knight doesn't like fighting alone, so its special ability lets me summon *another* one.  kite: now i overlay leveleight galaxyeyes, and my two galaxy knights. with these three monsters, i build the overlay network, and xyz summon, neo galaxyeyes photon dragon..  kite: prepare to witness the mightiest of monsters. with the power of this beast, this battle is *over*..   vetrix: agh, not this. his monster is now *neo* galaxyeyesan *unexpected nuisance*. kite: when galaxyeyes is used as an overlay unit to summon neo galaxyeyes, every other monster *loses* its special ability. vetrix: rrgghh.  kite: go. photon howling.  vetrix: that means genomheritage's special ability is canceled.. kite: that's right. so get ready, because your number is *up*.  yuma: all right. kite can destroy genomheritage. astral: furthermore, if kite is successful then he will win the duel. kite: vetrix. there is no stopping me now, i knew i would beat you in this duel. and now i see the moment is *finally at hand*.. prepare as i strike the final blow.. neo galaxyeyes, attack genomheritage. ultimate photon stream of destruction..  vetrix: waaaaaaaaahhhhhh.. yuma: yes. haha. orbital: master kite ddid it. wonderful..  dr. faker: ah, that's my boy. magnificent. vetrix : hahahahahaha. ahahahahahahahaha, ahahahaha.   vetrix: hehehahahahahahaha. kite: no way. yuma: wah. vetrix : ahahahahahahahaha. tori: this can't be.  vetrix: hahahahahahahahahahaah.... ever so sorry to disappoint, but i'm still here. *how*, you ask. just before your attack, i activated the trap "heraldry protection". kite: trap card.  vetrix: ah. *yes indeed*, kite. due to heraldry protection, i lower neo galaxyeyes's attack points by *eight hundred*.  vetrix: hahahahaha. soit's *still your move*.  kite: i end my turn.  vetrix: ...such *anger*. keep it coming. kite: what.. vetrix: your rage is so *abundant*. i should *thank* you. at this rate, i'll have all i need in *no time*.  vetrix: ahahahahahahahahaha.  kite: all of *what*. vetrix: why*anger*, of course...  vetrix: i draw. and now i summon, heraldic beast berners falcon.  vetrix: then i activate the spell card "heraldry reborn".  vetrix: this card lets me summon a levelfour or below heraldic monster from my graveyard.  vetrix: so i summon, heraldic beast basilisk.  vetrix: but wait, i'm not through. since i have two heraldic monsters on my field, i can summon heraldic beast eale from my hand.   vetrix: and now, for the move i've been building towards. i overlay levelfour berners falcon, basilisk, and eale..  vetrix: with these three monsters, i build the overlay network, and xyz summonnumber sixtynine, heraldry crest...   act 4 <<15:59  vetrix: *this duel ends* with number sixtynineheraldry crest. this is an *extremely difficult* monster to control. to do so, you must wield enormous amounts of*anger*. kite: *anger*. vetrix: that's right. i've been collecting it from *everyone*. they've all been *unknowingly contributing*.  vetrix : i harnessed *dextra's* anger, and of course *trey's*.  vetrix : and let's not forget *quatro* vetrix : and *quinton*. why, shark's anger nearly put me over the top..  kite: you're mad. vetrix: oh, no, i'd say *you* are, kite. heheheheheheheheh. it was *your* boundless rage that topped off my *stockpile of anger*.. it's thanks to your fury over little hart that i was able to summon heraldry crest, and *before too long*, you'll be wishing you'd never laid *eyes* on this monster.. heraldry crest steals your monster's special ability. ahahahahahahaha.  kite: no way. yuma: whaa..  vetrix: now, *go*, heraldry crest.. steal neo galaxyeyes's special ability. whipping lash..  kite: aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh..  vetrix: your monster *will* remain on your field. though i can't *imagine* neo galaxyeyes will be much use without its special abilities.  kite: you'll see how wrong you are. yuma: kite. orbital: wait. yyou need *me*..  yuma: waaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh.  yuma: whoa. vetrix: now to try out my *freshlystolen powers*.  vetrix: i activate neo galaxyeyes's special ability.  vetrix: and i'll also use one overlay unit to get rid of *your* monster's overlay units.  vetrix: heraldry crest gains five hundred attack points for every overlay unit that your monster neo galaxyeyes lost. so heraldry crest gains *fifteen hundred attack points.  vetrix: but hold onthere's a bit more. since your monster lost three overlay units, heraldry crest can attack you *three times in a row*, kite. noware you prepared to handle a triplestrike.  vetrix: oh, now *don't be upset*. it's not *all* bad. due to the effect of the trap heraldry protection, neo galaxyeyes won't be destroyed. no*you* will take all the damage. oh, and fakercrushing your son... fills me with *unparalleled joy*..  vetrix : hahahahahahaha. dr. faker: vetrix.. vetrix: now, heraldry crest, attack neo galaxyeyes photon dragon..  vetrix: dark matter demolition..  vetrix: finish him, heraldry crest. and make sure he *never forgets this defeat*..     yuma: kite, no..  kite: brother... vetrix: *you are beaten*.. but since my monster and i are having such a *good time* attacking you, i'll do it again. why stop the fun now.  vetrix: dark matter demolition.. yuma: hang in there, kite...  tori: ahh.  vetrix: whatishappening....  vetrix: no.. it *can't be*. it's *hart*..  kite : thank you, hart.  hart: oh, no. thank *you*, brother.  vetrix: aww. how touching. hart showed up just in time to soften his brother's final blow. i'd be moved to *tears* if i were *capable* of it. but i'm not.  vetrix: this duel is mineas are your soul and number cards.  vetrix: hmhmhmhmhmhmhmhmhm.  yuma: kite. speak to me, come on. wake up.  yuma: kite.. no..  end <<21:09 * special thanks to animeratio.com for the copy of this episode
