  act 1 <2:29>   mr. kay: your defeat is coming, yumai can assure you.  mr. kay: but for now, i place one card facedown and end my turn.  yuma: ahhh.... okay. um. lemme think. lemme think.  computer: attention. viral release will occur in exactly twenty minutes.  astral: it is my turn. yuma: i can *do this by myself*, astral.. kazwell: yuma keeps yelling and screaming at someone who *clearly isn't there*. in the end, should we be concerned about him. tori: no no, he's fine, <3:00> don't *worry*, kazwell. this is just what yuma's like when he's really *feelin' the flow*. yuma:  it's my turn. i draw. astral: i suggest that you summon ganbara knight. yuma: go away and duel your *own* duel. astral: a number card is on the line here, yuma. if we don't get that number... i may fade away. yuma: oh yeah. well maybe i should let 'im *win* then. astral: you need me, yuma. you cannot duel without me. you are *not good enough*. yuma: rrrghh, stop talking to me and just go away.. i'm not gonna do *anything* you tell me to do in this duel. astral: why would you disregard my valuable advice. yuma: if you tell me that i should go to the right, then i'm gonna break to the *left*. you say i should bust out ganbara knight. so i'll summon achacha archer.   astral: *bad* move. yuma: fire away. achacha archer: achacha.  yuma: whoohooo. <4:00> see what i did.. i managed to damage his lifepoints. astral: perhaps, but you missed out. yuma: huh. astral: if you had summoned ganbara knight as i advised you to, you would have been able to combine it with your golem, and then xyz summon utopia. yuma: oh. i hadn't thought about that.  yuma: rrgh. i mean, *it's all part of my master plan.*  mr. kay: *you're messing with my perfection*. but fortunately, i've got a trapdamage vaccine omega max.  mr. kay: and since i just took damage, i can use this card to regain all the lifepoints i just lost. yuma: uh.... are you telling me my attack was pointless.. mr. kay: in a way, this entire *duel* is pointless, my dear boy. someone like you *can't* defeat someone like me.   kazwell: aaah. i can see my future now.. they're gonna think i was part of this and they're gonna throw me in jail for life.. i'm never gonna be valedictorian, and i'll never get a job, and yuma's running outta time, and that means*i'm* running out of time.  act 2 <5:00>   kari: the deactivation code should be somewhere in the vpn tunnels ahead. i'm onto you, virus. yuma: uhh... i end my turn. mr. kay: you accomplished *nothing*. huh.  just as i did on my last turn, i can use my number card's overlay unit, to seize control of your monster. yuma: wait, wait, *what*. no, no, hang on, don't, heynononot, gaaaaaahh.  yuma: ohh, he got my gogogo golem *again*. astral: if you had summoned utopia, then he would not have been able to take control of your golem. yuma: really. astral: terrorbyte's ability allows it to take control of a monster with a certain level. but xyz monsters, like utopia, have *ranks*not levels. understand.  astral: you are clearly inexperienced. you should listen to me. yuma: forget *that*. so i take a little damagebig deal. <6:00> gogogo golem's gonna return to my field. and when *that happens*... mr. kay: heheheh. yuma: huh. mr. kay: d'you seriously expect me to use the same exact strategy two turns in a row. this time around i'm activating two continuous spells.  tori: do you know what a continuous spell is. kazwell: it's just like a normal spell, only its effect stays active for as long as the card remains on the field. now please let me go back to freaking out. mr. kay: heh. with "infected mail", once a turn, any levelfourorbelow monster on my field can attack you directly. but after it attacksit's destroyed. astral: oh, no. mr. kay: and since it's on my field, i'm going to attack you with your very own gogogo golem.  mr. kay: *so sorry*, yuma. but now it's time to say goodbye to your precious golem.  yuma: aw, man, this is *not good*. mr. kay: i'm afraid it gets *worse*. for it's at this moment that my second continuous spell activates. <7:00> since "infected mail" destroyed your golem, "cracking" slams you with an additional eight hundred points of damage.  mr. kay: heheheh, so what do you think of my special patented terrorbyte combo. yuma: uhh... well, i think your special patented terrorbyte combo... *stinks.* huh.  yuma: that's weird....  yuma: uh, why are you *more* seethrough than before.  astral: every time you lose lifepoints, i can feel my life force fading. yuma: fading.... like... that must mean...  yuma : you weren't kidding. fb astral: failure is not an option for *me*.   tori: yuma seems like he's lost some of his enthusiasm. kazwell : of course he's lost his enthusiasm. he's losing this duel. he's gonna totally get meah. *i* know. kazwell: hey, yuma.  kazwell: be like the, the phoenix. and riiiiise from the ashes. cacawww.  yuma: why are youwhat are you. kazwell: ahh, forget the phoenix. <8:00> yeah.  kazwell : there's a *dragon* in your heart, yuma. aaa giant sleeping dragon, bird, monster. kazwell: iin the end, what i'm saying is that you've got *tremendous potential* inside of you. yuma: uhh, i do... kazwell: all you have to do is wake that potential up, and this duel is *yours*.  yuma: uh, thanks, ah, that's a really cool thing for you to say.  yuma: let's go. let's wake up the *dragon*. astral : observation number six. praise motivates humans....  yuma, i, also, have something that i have been meaning to say to you. yuma: what, astral.  astral : you are illogical, and you anger too easily. you are clumsy and lacking athletic ability...  astral : you are stubborn, too. and odd.  astral : but these are all excellent traits.  astral: so earlier, when i said you were *inexperienced*, i meant to say, 'incredible.'  yuma: yeah, right, now you're just makin' fun a' me.  yuma: huh. what. what's that. what's going on, why is the room moving. <9:00>  kazwell: ohwhoa. the ceiling's opening. we'rewe're going up. we're, we're *outside*.  tori: are we going all the way to the top..  kari: bingo. the viral code should be *just beyond that door*.  crashbug..  kari: you want a *piece* a' me, do ya. bring it on. you're about to learn a valuable lesson kari: *never* underestimate a black belt in *codebreaking*.  kari: haaahhh.  mr. kay: from up here, we'll have the best view in the city to witness the results of the viral bug.  mr. kay: i'm placing one card facedown and ending my turn. astral : if yuma loses this duel, i will fade away. how can i get him to listen to me.  fb yuma: i'm not gonna do *anything* you tell me to do in this duel. <10:00> if you tell me that i should go to the right, then i'm gonna break to the *left*.  astral : that gives me an idea. yuma: here i go. it's my turn. i draw.   yuma: ha, sweet. i drew a great card. goblindbergh, take to the skies.  kazwell: this is what i call a very promising development. because when goblindbergh comes to the field, he can bring *another* monster *with* it.  astral: yuma, use this opportunity to summon zubaba knight. yuma: thanks for the suggestion. since you think i should go with zubaba knighti think i'll go with *ganbara* knight.   yuma: whoa.... i just realizedthey're both level four. that means, i can xyzsummon utopia.  yuma: i am feelin' the flow like you would not believe.  yuma: i'm highfiving the sky, baby. i'm not just in the zone, there's like, *another* zone *inside* the zone and *that's* the zone i'm in. <11:00>  yuma: now *check me out* as i xyzsummonnumber thirtynine, utopia.  act 3 <11:24>  mr. kay: whoa.... utopia... astral: yuma, listen. *do not* lay down a trap card. yuma: rrrghh.... astral: you're not skilled enough to use one. yuma: rrrghhh, *not skilled enough*.. i'm all *about* skill, ya floating bag a' wind, i'll show you. i'm placing one card facedown. it's all you, teach.  kari: delete my entire hard drive and erase my scoop, didja..  bug. kari: i did it. uh...  bug.... bug. bug. <12:00> mr. kay: it's my turn, now. huh. and once again, i activate terrorbyte's special ability. this time i'll be taking control of achacha archer.  yuma: rrrgh... use your own monsters for once. mr. kay: why should i. thanks to my terrorbyte combo, i get *so much more* out of turning *your* monsters against *you*.  kazwell: because of mr. kay's combo, archer will go downand then take *yuma* down *with* 'im.  yuma: aaahhh.... you mean if this succeeds, my goose is cooked..  astral: too bad utopia is so useless. if only it had some *ability*. yuma: wait a second.... utopia has the *perfect* ability. i got an *overlay unit* for ya, mr. kay.  achacha archer: achacha.... yuma: go ahead and hit me with your best shot, 'cause thanks to utopia, i can put a stop to one monster's attack. astral: infected mail's effect only activates when the monster's direct attack succeeds. since utopia has stopped the attack, not only is archer safe... <13:00> but "cracking" will not be able to activate, either. yuma: hah, *yeah*... i can stop you from pulling off your combo. mr. kay: *well*. it seems i may've underestimated you. kazwell: yuma's been displaying some rare bursts of intelligence. tori: it's, probably the invisible duelist telling him what to do. kazwell: you were serious about that. astral: now your teacher has used up all of his overlay units. yuma: nice. you can't do your combo anymore. mr. kay: you don't *honestly think* that i failed to gauge your strategy just now, do you, yuma. yuma: maybe. mr. kay: you've managed to pave a new road leading straight towards my victory. i now activatethe "bug switch" trap card. when crashbug x, y, and z are in my graveyard, i switch one of my monsters to summon *super crashbug* in defense mode.  super crashbug: super crash....  yuma: oh boy, that's a relief. for a second there, i thought you were busting out some *huge monster* in attack mode. <14:00> mr. kay: now, why on earth would i go and do something as *ineffective* as that... when i can activate super crashbug's special ability. now, all monsters in attack mode swap their attack and defense points.  mr. kay: terrorbyte had twentynine hundred defense points. but *now* it's got twentynine hundred *attack* points. yuma: aahh. are you serious.. it was strong *before*, but.... aw, manand now *my* monsters are *weaker*.  mr. kay: and that means it's the perfect time to attack. go, terrorbyte. attack utopia.. astral: don't dodge this. yuma: i'm absolutely dodging it. i'm activating utopia's ability. by using up its last overlay unit, i can stop your attack. tori: nice. kazwell: no*not* nice. now utopia's completely out of overlay units. without those, yuma can't prevent future attacks. tori: aah.... mr. kay: i place one card facedown and end my turn.  astral : i think i *know* what that facedown card is.... <15:00> mr. kay: this will all be over on my next turn. yuma: aahh...  computer: viral release will occur in approximately five minutes. yuma: terrorbyte is so much *stronger* than my monsters now.... mr. kay is right. if i don't beat him *this* turn, then i'm donefor. astral: yuma, listen to me. yuma: huh. astral: whatever you do, *do not* use zubaba knight and achacha archer to xyzsummon leviathan dragon. *that* is a bad idea.  yuma: oh, yeahthat's right, i've got another number card. and since you think this is a *bad* idea, then *i* think it's the *perfect* idea.  zubaba knight: zubabaaa knight.  yuma: now that my knight is out and about, i'm gonna overlay it with achacha archer to form the overlay network.  yuma: mister kay, i'd like to introduce you to number seventeen, leviathan dragon.  <16:00>  mr. kay: interesting. but you seem to have forgotten about the effect super crashbug will have. remember, the attack and defense points of a monster in attack mode *are swapped*which means your leviathan dragon now has *zero attack points*. yuma: dah... all that effort and excitement, right down the drain.  see, i *told you* that was a bad idea. it's like when you told me *not to dodge*if i had just *stood there*, thenohh...  fb astral: don't dodge this.  yuma : *that* was bad advice, even for *him*.  fb yuma: if you tell me that i should go to the right, then i'm gonna break to the *left*.   yuma: you were playing the opposite game with me. astral: you should activate "thunder short" from your hand, yuma.  astral: with that, your victory will be assured.  astral: no games this time. if you don't do this, i will vanish from this world.  yuma: from my hand, i'm activating the "thunder short" spell card. <17:00> thunder short dishes out five hundred points of damage for every monster you haveyou can multiply big numbers, right, mister kay..  mr. kay: uggghh. this isn't funny anymore. once again, i activate damage vaccine omega max. and once again, just as i did before, i regain lifepoints equal to the damage i took.  yuma: i just can't make a dent in this guy. astral: i think you are forgetting about your trap card. yuma: huh. a trap card. oh yeah. i activate the overconfidence trap.  mr. kay: the... the *what*.. yuma: since you've regained lifepoints, i can destroy your monster. or to put it in a way a *math teacher* would understand, 'whaddaya get when you subtract super crashbug from your field.'.  kazwell: with super crashbug gone, all the monsters on the field revert back to their normal attack and defense points.  mr. kay: uh. <18:00> this can't be. now terrorbyte has no attack points. yuma: do your stuff, leviathan dragon.. attack with shock stream blast.  yuma: and now utopia's gonna bring it home.. direct attaaaaack. rising sun slash. mr. kay: aaaaaahhhhh.  tori: hurray. you did it, yuma. kazwell: a miraculous, comefrombehind victory..  yuma: i totally did it.. i beat my math teacher. astral: i'm somewhat amazed that we pulled that off. yuma: huh. hey, how didja know that mister kay was gonna *restore his lifepoints* like that. astral: your math teacher was aiming for perfection.  astral : it became clear to me that your teacher did not want to lose *any* lifepoints. <19:00> that he would put his desire to be perfect above everything else.  astral : so i reasoned he was going to try to regain his lifepoints, even if he did not need to at the time.   astral : this card contains a memory that was once a part of me.... number thirtyfour....  astral: i remember the place where i came from. a different galaxy....  astral: ...astralworld.... that is where i am from.   astral : ... that is all i remember.  tori: mister kay. mister kay. wake up.  mr. kay: what're... all you guys doing here. yuma: hurry. you said you'd stop the viral countdown thing. mr. kay: the viral countdown.... i can't. <20:00> the viral release doesn't have a cancellation code. yuma: are you serious.. you mean the city is doomed.  kari: ugh. haven't you *had enough*....  craaash....  kari: i did it.  kari: why is the clock still ticking.  computer: three...  computer: two...  computer: one.  act 4 <20:24>  kazwell: aah. we're doomed.. it's all over. mr. kay: what're you guys shouting about over here. yuma: *your virus*. weren't you trying to crash the city's systems and cause panic and chaos..  mr. kay: why would you think i'd *do* something like that.. tori: uh, everything *does* seem normal... mr. kay: i'll admit that during my preparations i accidentally caused *some* trouble, but... yuma: but what. what did that program *do* just now.  mr. kay: ah.... *there* we are. you wanna know what i did. just put on your duel gazers and look up at the sky. <21:00>  yuma: this is getting *weirder and weirder*.  yuma: whoa. what isis thatall: there's a *giant crashbug in the sky*. mr. kay: i was looking at the patterns in the city's night lights, and i noticed that they seemed to be forming an incredibly complex matrix code. with my duel gazer, i scanned the pattern, and realized it was just one optical fragment away from being and *exact replica* of the crashbug qcode. and i realized, the museum's dome isn't normally lit up at night.  yuma: so then all of this was just you trying to turn on those lights and make a giant crashbug appear in the sky.. mr. kay: yeah, you got it.  yuma: well that's *weird*. kazwell: yumalook.  yuma: your crashbug card. you rubbing it in that you beat me yesterday. kazwell: read the description.  little kid: whoa. it's crashbug.  little girl: crashbug is the best.  yeah, crashbug. whoahohoho, all right.  kari: guess maybe i just wasn't meant to have a big scoop this week.  <22:00>  yuma : 'crashbug is an electric spirit that eats the bugs in our lives. sadness, doubt, frustrationno bug is too big for crashbug.'  yuma: 'if you see crashbug on the night of a full moon, it brings you good luck'. kazwell: don't you get it, yet. in the end, mister kay just wanted *everyone* to have good luck.  astral: observation number seven. number cards affect people. they change them.  astral: they seem to amplify their individual wants and desires, almost to the point they *take over*... i need to remember that. end <22:35> * special thanks to animeratio.com for
