 quatro: which of my *fabulous fans* should i take on today. so many potential targets to choose from. heheheheheheheh. quentin: your attitude *seriously* concerns me, quatro.  quentin: watching your fans squirm really *does* give you a *charge*, does it.  quatro: i believe you're *jealous*, quentin. hey, it isn't *my* fault i'm popular. besides, those chumps get what they deserve.  quatro: and i have to make my work interesting *somehow*, since there's never a chance i'll *lose*.  quentin: don't be so sure of that, quatro. your arrogance will be your downfall. quatro: if you don't like how i operate, then maybe *you* should start collecting numbers.  quentin: i *will*, once the opponents get *tougher*. quatro: uh.... *really*. so you think you're a better *duelist* than me, huh. grab your deck and let's find out. trey: all right, that's *enough*, quatro.  trey: we're *brothers*. we shouldn't be fighting amongst ourselves. quatro: mind your own business, pipsqueak. vetrix: no. trey *happens* to be right.  vetrix: i approve of your selfconfidence, quatro. but you must learn to better exercise selfcontrol like the *others*. quatro: 'scuse me.. why does it matter what *you* actually think.  quentin: *watch it*, quatro. quatro: huh. *what's* that.  quentin: you *will* show vetrix some respect. you won't talk to him that way.  quatro: ngh, *fine*, quentin.  quentin: i take it you understand what your mission is today, don't you, trey. trey : yes, brother.  quentin: the duelist they call shark is still trying to track down quatro.  quentin: better hold onto this number card. i have a feeling that you'll be running into each other very soon. trey: right. i understand.  quentin: doctor faker... someday i'll take *everything* from you, just like you took everything from *us*. vetrix: quentin.  vetrix: just make sure doctor faker doesn't find out about me. he thinks i'm gone. i want to *leave it* that way... 'til the day *i reveal myself*.  act 1 <<3:19  mr. heartland : greetings from heart land city. welcome all. it's day two of the world duel carnival. today, you can make your dreams come true. just make sure you all duel with mr. heartland: *lots and lots of heart*. good luck..   yuma: yess. i'm gonna sweep this tournament.  lillybot: dream on, yuma. sweeping is my job. yuma: teh. well, i'm doing *pretty awesome* so far. see this.  lillybot: is that garbage. it looks broken. yuma: no, it's for the *tournament*, and i have three heart pieces already. if i keep winning, i'm a *shooin* for the finals. i am *so* feelin' the flow. tori: *first*, make sure you win your *next* duel. bronk: *pick up the pace*, kazwell.. tori: huh.  kazwell: wait up, bronk. tori: *they're* in a rush. wonder what's up. yuma: pizza shop must be givin' out free slices. yess.  bronk: *c'mon*, flatfoot. kazwell: slow down. whoa, whaaaa.  kazwell : i meant to do that... bronk: quit goofin' *around*. we don't wanna be late. yuma: yo.  yuma: where ya speedin' off to. bronk: hey, guys. kazwell: haven't you heard. yuma: huh.  kazwell: quatro's gonna be here.  yuma: who's quatro. bronk: he's, like, one a' the *best duelists in the world*.  yuma: oh. bronk: he *rules*. quatro faced off against shark in the finals a' the nationals. yuma: that was *him*.  astral: we must be cautious when dealing with this individual, yuma. kazwell: quatro just challenged bronk and me to duel. isn't that *awesome*. yuma: ugh. you guys should turn 'im down.  kazwell: uh, you kidding.  yuma: uh... somebody told me that quatro doesn't play by the rulebook. bronk: he is one of the most *honest duelists* that you'll ever meet. kazwell: this duel is a dream come true.  kazwell: he's our hero. losing to him will be a tremendous honor.  bronk: hey, we're gonna be late. kazwell: oh yeah, i almost forgot. bronk: move it or lose it, second place. kazwell: *hey*. yuma: waitwe're comin' too.  yuma: this is a strange place to have a duel. kazwell: *quatro* picked the spot. probably wanted someplace quiet to avoid his fans. bronk: yeah, that makes a lotta sense. yuma: uh... i guess.  bronk and kazwell: quatro..  kazwell: i can't believe it's really you.. quatro: you must be kazwell and bronk. my apologies for being late. shall we get started, my friends. kazwell: yeah. but before we docan i have your autograph..  bronk: oh, me too me too. quatro: with pleasure. i get a thrill out of spoiling my fans.  quatro: is this okay. kazwell: ohh. quatro, i can't thank you enough. bronk: don't forget me..  quatro: herehappy. bronk: very.  quatro: now let's get dueling.  kazwell: hey, bronkwho d'you think should go first. bronk: i dunno... quatro: i supposeall three of us could duel at once.  quatro: we can have a battle royale, and put all our heart pieces on the line.  yuma: a battle royale. astral: *interesting*. yuma: huh. astral: under battle royale rules, all three duelists will compete against each other. but quatro *must think* that bronk and kazwell will both try to defeat him. so in effect, this will really be a *twoonone* duel. even though quatro is more experienced, the odds will be against him.) quatro: i just *love spoiling my fans*. i want this duel to be special for you. there's even a chance that together you could beat me. it should be a memorable matchup. yuma: guess they were rightquatro *is* cool.  bronk: all set.. kazwell: yeah. bronk and kazwell: duel disk go. get ready.  quatro: heheheheheheheheheheheh.  bronk and kazwell: duel gazer, let's roll.  bronk, kazwell, quatro: let's duel.. act 2 <<7:38  bronk, kazwell, quatro: let's duel..  quatro: i'll let you two go first. bronk: huh. but wait, the duelist who goes last is at a *big disadvantage* in a battle royale. kazwell: i guess he's giving us another *break*. bronk: i'll make the first move. here goesi draw.  an' i'm summonin' the monster ayeiron.   ayeiron: aye. aye. aiiiieee. bronk: but under the rules of a battle royale, nobody can attack until all the duelists take one turn. so i'm done.  bronk: 's your move, kazwell. kazwell: okeydokey. i draw. and first i'm summoning debugger x.  kazwell: and now it's *your turn*, quatro. quatro: well, *well*. you've chosen very *unusual* monsters. nice work, you guysi can see you're both shrewd *and creative*. kazwell: didja hear that. he just praised us, bronk. bronk: i know, but we should keep our guards up. quatro: now, gentlemen*i* draw. i place a monster facedown in defense mode. but *i'm not done yet*. next i'll place two *more* cards facedown. and finally, i activate the field spell "xyz colosseum". this spell boosts the attack points of all xyz monsters in the colosseum by two hundred points, but if your monster *isn't* an xyz monster, you're out of luck because it *can't attack*.  quatro: and now i end my turn. tori: uh...  tori: this field looks old, and *creepy*. astral : why did quatro choose *this* field for a confrontation. it is true that his xyz monsters will have more power, but so will the xyz monsters of his opponents.  bronk: i see what he's up to. ya can't summon an xyz monster 'til you have at least two monsters of the same level. kazwell: *that's* why quatro did it. he played his field spell to stop our attacks 'til he draws the cards he needs. bronk: *unless*, we outsmart 'im. hey, quatro check this. i'm summonin' tin goldfish.  bronk: and now i can summon a *twin* of my tin, 'cause once i summon *one* tin goldfish, i can play another one *right away*. here's tin goldfish number two.   astral: bronk is trying to use quatro's strategy against him. yuma: go for it.. bronk: now i'll take my tin goldfish an' ayeiron, and overlay them.  bronk: now i can build the overlay network.  bronk: an' that means i can xyz summon. so say helloto tin archduke.   quatro: *excellent*. you're a lot quicker on the draw than i expected, bronk. bronk: that was just a *warmup act*, quatro.. since tin archduke is an xyz monster, colosseum's effect makes it stronger by two hundred attack points.  bronk: and that's not all. i activate its *special ability*. now i can use one overlay unit and pull a *switcharoo* on your monster's battle mode. quatro: oh my. it looks like you've outmaneuvered me *again*, bronk. you certainly are a *talented* duelist. bronk: wow. thanks, quatro. kazwell: nice goin'. the duel just got started and quatro has praised you twice already. bronk: i'm changin' quatro's facedown monster in defense mode, to attack mode.  quatro: gentlemen, say hello to my *gimmick puppet princess*.  astral: that monster has *zero attack points*. kazwell: this is gonna be a breeze. bronk: i can't miss. okay, archdukeattack that gimmick puppet princess. lead bop.  quatro: rrrgghh, ugh, i activate, the "puppet repair" trap card. this card comes in handy when a puppet monster that's level four or lower gets destroyed. it lets me summon the same monster from my deck.  quatro: so here's another gimmick puppet princess.  bronk: okaythen i'll just pull the old reversalroundin' trick *again*. use your special ability, tin archduke. by using an overlay unit, i'll change your monster's battle mode. so now, your puppet's in attack mode.  quatro: *amazing*. your monster can actually use its special ability more than once a turn. *this isn't looking good for me.* tori: oh, wow. i can hardly believe it. yuma: i know. if bronk and kazwell keep up the pressure, they could pull off an upset. kazwell: my turn nowi draw. quatro really messed upthis is *too easy*. with no attack points, his monster's a sitting duck.  kazwell: in the end, any attack at all will pulverize his puppet, and by using an attack that's at least sixteenhundred points, we'll win the duel. i summon debugger z in attack mode.  kazwell: here's where the *real* fun begins. 'cause if there's a debugger x on the field when i summon my debugger z, then i can also summon my debugger y.  quatro: yikes. that makes *three* levelthree monsters. kazwell: guess ya know what's coming next, quatro. i'm overlaying all *three* debuggers.  kazwell: and now i build the overlay network, and xyz summon. here comesantidote nurse.  kazwell: and now, thanks to the colosseum field spell, antidote nurse gets a boost for two hundred attack points.  yuma: just what the *doctor ordered*. kazwell: get that princess, antidote nurse.  quatro: oh no. what'm i going to do..  bronk and kazwell: oh yeah.. yuma: they won.  act 3 <<13:12  bronk: great teamwork, kazwell. kazwell: all right. we beat quatro.. quatro: my *congratulations*.  quatro: your attacks *have been* *truly* amusing. but they were hardly enough to defeat me.  yuma: hold on. kazwell destroyed his monster. astral : interesting. kazwell: yeahhow did you survive. quatro: i simply activated my "gimmick box" trap as soon as you attacked. not only don't i take *any damage* from your attack, but this trap card then transforms into a monster card.  quatro: and that's not the only surprise i have in store. you remember the amount of damage i *would've* taken. that becomes my monster's attack points instead.  trey: you should forget about this duel, brother. it's clear they don't have any number cards. or else they would've *used* them already. yuma: number cards.. astral: i see. quatro and his brother must be number hunters.  quatro: now, my friends, since i can't take any numbers from you... i'll enjoy watching you *squirm*, instead. kazwell: say *what*. bronk: wwha' does *that* mean.  quatro: how many times do i have to tell you, i love *spoiling my fans*.  when i say spoiled i mean *really* spoiled..  quatro: you're *finished*..  i have to admit you two were *pretty good*. better than *most* of the chumps i've faced.  quatro: unfortunately your dueling skills are still *far below mine*. even working together you're not good enough to beat me. gimmick puppet scarecrow. come out. (] quatro: next i activate the spell card, "level doubler". now i can send one of the cards in my hand to the graveyard , to double my puppet scarecrow's level from four to *eight*.  quatro: you feelin' the thrill yet.  quatro: hmhmhmhaha, now it's time to end this duel. i overlay leveleight gimmick box and gimmick puppet scarecrow, in order to build the overlay network.  quatro: i xyz summon number fifteen, gimmick puppet giant grinder.   bronk: ohhhhhhhhhh. yuma: agh.... he *really is* a number hunter. quatro: there's more. don't forget xyz colosseum gives my giant two hundred more attack points.  quatro: and then my giant can activate its special ability. by using an overlay unit it can target the xyz monsters you activated, *and destroy them*.    quatro: your nightmare is just *beginning*, though, because the attack points of the destroyed monster are then dealt to you as damage. bronk and kazwell: damage.  quatro: that's twentyfour hundred attack points *coming your way*. this duel's been fun, you fools. *fire away*.. act 4 <<16:27  quatro: this duel's been fun, you fools. *fire away*..  kazwell: oh, no... bronk....  quatro: you're next, *small fry*.  quatro: sorry i have to destroy your *antidote nurse*.  quatro: but *don't worry*. all her power will be coming *right back at you*.  quatro: blast away..  quatro: i won't be happy until all my fans get *exactly* what they deserve..  quatro: hehehehehnhn. you two twerpsare going down with a *big bang*. i activate my two gimmick puppet princesses' special abilities from my graveyard.  quatro: i banish them to summon two monsters from your graveyards back to your fields.  quatro: first up, tin archduke.  yuma: he's going after their monsters *again*.  quatro: and because my colosseum's effect will increase tin archduke's attack points, there's even *more* power i can turn against you.  astral: of course.. quatro has set up a perfect attack loop. yuma: whaddaya mean. he can use their monsters against them *again*.. astral: correct. your friends are helpless... quatro: my fans are no different from the puppet monsters contained in my deck.  quatro: they're helpless to resist my will, and i'm pulling *all the strings*. huhehuhahahahaha.  quatro: once again my giant will *destroy* your feeble monsters, and *end this duel*..   astral: quatro set this trap up from the beginning of the match. he tricked bronk and kazwell into using monsters that he could use against them.  astral : his strategy is devious, but quite effective.  tori: they've lost. quatro: it's *not over yet*.  quatro: i still have a *lot more spoiling* to do. *go, giant grinder*.. yuma: hold on. your duel is *over*..  quatro: sorrybut this duel isn't finished until *i* decide it is. now, giant grinder. *final dance*..  kazwell: uuaaaaaaaaaaagghhh.. bronk: aaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh.  tori : this is *horrible*.  yuma: come on, you guyswake up. wake up. astral : this is not good... ugh...   yuma: everything's gonna be okay, bronk. bronk: but what about... kazwell.  yuma: please, hang on....  you *maniac*.. they looked up to you. why did you do this to them.. quatro: hahahaheheheh, let's just saythat i find it *tremendously entertaining*.  yuma: that does it... quatro, *i'm* challenging you *now*. get ready to duel..  quatro: does this mean *you've* become a fan, too.  shark: hello, quatro.  yuma: what's *shark* doing here.  shark: you were hard to find, but now that i've hunted you down, quatro*let's duel*... end <<20:00 * special thanks to animeratio.com for the copy of this episode transcribed online. * special thanks to yugioh wikia as a source for checking cards. * special thanks to kazuki takahashi, 4kids, et al. for yugioh. zexal. last updated: february 4, 2013 i don't own yugioh zexal, at all, and this transcript is unofficial and without any permission whatsoever. please link back to me if you use my work. for more information about my transcript format, please click here. read my blog post on this episode here  )
