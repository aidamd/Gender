  act 1 <<2:35  quatro: this is the *end of the line for you*, kite.. yuma: i play the trap "courageous heart".  yuma: : by giving up half my lifepointsi'll stopmachu mech's special ability this turn and save kite..  yuma and astral: ooaaaaaahhhh...... tori: oh no.  quatro: rgh, sooner we get rid a' that *kid* the better. trey : that was *completely* unselfish.  yuma: astralare you okay. astral: ugh... it is nothing. focus on *winning the duel*, and saving hart.  kite: why did you*save* me. yuma: it's like i said. i'm keeping the promise i made to your brother. kite: rescuing hart is *my* job.  kite: i place one card facedown and end my turn. tori: *hey*.. it wouldn't hurt to say *thank you* once in a while.. orbital: *please* ccut 'im some slack. he's superstressed about his brother.  hart: kite.... kite, where are you..   fb kite: here ya go. fb hart: thanks, kite. that's the most amazing butterfly you've ever *caught*.  vetrix : yes. i've tapped into hart's memories.  fb hart: ohh, it looks more like a *jewel* than a bug, doesn't it.  fb hart: hey, kite. since *you* caught this butterfly for me... is it okay if i free it. fb kite : but why. fb hart: it's just that this butterfly was *made* to be free. and i don't think that it could ever be happy locked in a *cage*. fb orbital: that is logical. fb kite: you're right, hart. let it go.   vetrix: *thank* you, hart. soon *all* your memories will be mine.  act 2 <<4:48  kite: hart....  come on*make your move* already. quatro: heh heh heh. why the *rush*. heheheh. not like hart's in too much *danger*...  yuma: quit stalling, quatro. trey : don't push them *too* far. quatro : *too far*, trey. if you're too *soft* for this job, maybe you should *leave*.  trey: *quatro*... quatro: well.. you *dueling* or *not*.  trey: let's continue.  hah.. i activate the spell "chronomaly pyramid eye tablet".  trey: with this card's effect, i can increase the attack points of all my chronomaly monsters by *eight hundred*. and now i'll use machu mech's special ability.  trey: since its attack points changed, i can use one overlay unit to deal eight hundred points of damage.  trey: get set, machu mech. go, infinity cannon.  quatro: hahahahaha, *excellent* work, trey.. now target *kite*.. attack..  trey: go, machu mech. destroy galaxyeyes. torch him, with meteor meltdown..  quatro: with your photon dragon's attack points *already down to zero*, your lifepoints are *history*. it's over, kite. so long.  yuma: watch out. kite: i activate, "battle simulation". with this trap, our monsters lose half their attack points, and can't be destroyed in battle.  quatro: your monster might be safe, but your lifepoints aren't..  kite: auugghh..... orbital: iimpact alert..  yuma: kite. are you okay.  kite: *yes*.  yuma: you're hurt. kite: i'm *fine*. i can *still duel*and beat *them*..  quatro: please, it's hopeless. you can't save your brother, but there's still time to *chicken out*, and save *yourself*. ahahahahahahahahaha. kite: rrrggghhh... that *does it*. yuma: wait, kite. just *cool off*. kite: my brother's in danger. you don't know me or what i'm going through.  yuma: you're wrong. i *do* knowand here's why. i know you because i've dueled against you *before*. and kite, i *know* you're a great duelist.  yuma: i saw then how brave and skilled you are.  yuma: but i also saw you have a great spirit. we *can* save hart. by dueling as a team. not for revengebut as friends who won't give up.  yuma: we just have to believe that we can highfive the sky. together, we'll feel the flow, and win. astral: it is your turn, yuma. this draw is crucial. make it count, my friend. yuma: you *got it*, astral. i *draw*.  yuma: perfect. i now activate, the spell "monster reborn".  yuma: now i can bring back utopia.  trey: we didn't plan for *this*, quatro.  yuma: it's time to take this duel to the *next level*.. let's show 'em how, utopia. yuma and astral : go, chaos xyz evolution..  yuma and astral : make way for chaos number thirtynine, utopia ray..   trey: no way.... quatro: what's a *chaos number*..  quentin: that boy... can *change his number*.... *interesting*. who *is* this yuma tsukumo. ... could it *be*.... yuma: *you*are *goin' down*. quatro: where'd a twerp like yuma learn how to do *that*.. yuma: i activate utopia ray's special ability. by using one overlay unit, it gets a five hundred attack point powerup.  yuma: go, overlay charge.  astral: yumamachu mech does not have any overlay units left to use. but giant grinder has one overlay unit and can still use its special ability. if so, we will lose the battle. let us attack, right away. yuma: okay. since utopia ray's special ability *also* gives it the power to erase one thousand attack points from another monster, we can weaken giant grinder. utopia ray, attack. go, rising sun chaos slash.  astral: quatro should be out of lifepoints, with this last attack. yuma: we knocked 'im outta the duel.  tori : all right. you did it.. orbital : yeah.  quatro: hahahahahaha...  quatro: hahahahahahahahahaha... sorry, but i survived, thanks to my "gimmick box" trap card. yuma: say *what*. quatro: not only don't i take any damage, but gimmick box transforms into a monster, whose attack points are equal to the damage i *would've* taken.  yuma: i thought for sure we could beat 'im with utopia ray. astral: but he seems to be prepared for every move we make. yuma: well, maybe *this* facedown will make things more difficult.  quatro: your utopia ray's attack points are returning to normal. no monster of yours will ever be a threat to me. i'm *too good*.  quatro: and now i'm going to *prove it*. i draw. hyah. i play the spell card, "junk puppet". with this, i can summon a gimmick puppet from my graveyard if it has a thousand attack points or less.  quatro: gimmick puppet dreary doll. welcome back to the duel..  quatro: heheheheheheheh...  quatro: now i can overlay my leveleight gimmick box and dreary doll, in order to build the overlay network.  quatro: i xyz summon, number forty. gimmick puppet of strings..   astral: yuma. yuma: aw, *great*. how're we gonna beat a number with three thousand attack points.. quatro: *obviously* the answer is that you *can't*. first up, i think i'll unleash number forty's fury on kite.  quatro: do it, puppet of strings. cut galaxyeyes down to size. celestial slash..  yuma : kite's lifepoints will be wiped out.  kite : hart. i've failed you. act 3 <<12:09  quatro: it's been nice dueling you*loser*. ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. yuma: i play "trap reborn". using this card, i'll sacrifice half my lifepoints.  yuma: and now, by banishing the trap in one of your graveyards, my card gains its effect. i choose kite's "battle simulation".  yuma: ugh... now both monsters lose half their attack points, and neither monster is destroyed in battle. that means kite's *still in this duel*.  quatro: that *may be*, but kite still loses lifepoints.  orbital: he's almost out of points....  quatro: yuma. that attack was perfect 'til you *botched it up*. this was supposed to be my moment of glory. you're makin' me look *bad*, kid.  trey : it takes *so much courage* to keep giving up your lifepoints the way yuma has. quatro: rrgh. you're having a lot of fun making a *pest* of yourself, yuma. but i'm about to becomea *pest exterminator*.. i activate puppet of strings' special ability. prepare to face the music.  quatro: by using one overlay unit, puppet of strings plays a *melody of mayhem*. at the end of your next turn, all monsters on the field are destroyed, and each duelist takes damage equal to the attack points of the monsters that they control.  yuma: what's the plan. quatro: the *plan* is for *you to lose*. your fate is sealed..  quatro: both you and kite are facing utter destruction. all hope for hart is truly lost. hahahahaha, ahahahahaha, hahahahahahahahahaha..  quatro: i'm pulling *all* the strings now.. there's no way you can save yourselves. so. are you two going to *give up*. astral : they must both be defeated during this next turn. or we will lose. *everything* depends on kite. he *must duel*.  yuma: but, *how*. he's too weak...  quatro: what's *wrong*, kitelost the will to fight. if you don't get up, then trey and i will be the winners. hmhmhm, ahahahahahahahaha. yuma: please, kite... ugh....  yuma: *get up*. come on.  yuma: we can't let quatro win. think of what'll happen to your brother.  kite : oh no... *hart*.... hart needs me....  fb hart: kite, please, help me.. help me, kite.  fb kite: no.  fb kite: come baaack..  fb kite: hart....  fb mr. heartland: hello, kite.  fb mr. heartland: i assume you'd like to see your brother again. that will only be possible if you show us you're a *team player*. you *will* help doctor faker... *won't* you.  fb kite: let hart go *now*...   fb hart : kite, please, help me.. help me, kite.  kite: don't worry, hart... i'll get you out of here no matter *what it takes*.  kite : just *hang on*, hart. i *will* save you..   vetrix : i'll take the memories of *both* brothers. they will prove *useful* to me. hart : no, vetrix. vetrix : mm. hart : those memories belong to *us*. i won't let you take them.  vetrix : hart. how did *you* get here.  quentin: this is . the energy matrix is destabilizing. vetrix, are you all right..  hart : my brother has always taken care of me, no matter *what* the cost.  hart : he's been my protector. this time, i'm going to protect *him*..  here, kite. you can use *my* power..  quatro: huh.. what's this.. orbital: master kikite..  yuma: ugghhh.... ...huh.  quatro: he's *up*..  yuma: wwhat happened to *kite*. astral: could *hart* do this....  quentin: i don't understand. the matrix was created from hart's energy. where did it *go*. kite : thanks, hart. i know the strength i feel, came from *you*.  astral: it appears the energy source that transformed kite will also give new power to his *deck*.  yuma: where'd it come from. astral: it was created from the bond between hart and his brother kite.  orbital: lookin' *goooooood*, master kite.  kite: look out, quatroooooo... here i go..  quatro: galaxyeyes doesn't have *any attack points*, and you've got a measly one hundred lifepoints. *how can you hurt me*.. you're as harmless as a *fly*... kite: i'm strong enough to outduel *you*.  kite: i've got my brother's strength. that's all i need. i'm gonna start my turn with a spell card. "overlay regen". now each xyz monster on the field gains an overlay unit.  kite: listen, astrali'll need your help.  kite: so let's try to work together. it's the only way to beat those two. astral: yumawhat if we give a *card* to kite, to help him out. yuma : awesome. in fact, let's give 'im *two*. kitehope *these* can help.  kite: i tribute utopia ray and damage mage, in order to summon photon caesar. when i use photon caesar to xyz summon, it counts as *two* monsters.  kite: i'm going to overlay galaxyeyeswith my two photon caesars..  kite: this monster trio is just what i need to build the overlay network. i xyz summon neo galaxyeyes photon dragon.   act 4 <<19:44  kite: i xyz summon, neo galaxyeyes photon dragon. yuma: that dragon got a *major makeover*.  kite: i activate neo galaxyeyes' special ability. photon howling.  kite: whenever galaxyeyes is used to summon *neo* galaxyeyes, the special abilities of *all* the other monsters get negated.  trey: *that* means, it'll be harder to destroy. he didn't even need to use an overlay unit for that move. kite: but it *will* use one for its *second* special ability.  kite: by *using* one overlay unit, neo galaxyeyes absorbs all the other overlay units on the field. for every unit absorbed, neo gains five hundred attack points this turn.  kite: plus it gets an *extra* attack for each absorbed overlay unit. trey: that's *six thousand points*. quatro: and it can keep attacking us, too. kite: neo galaxyeyes photon dragon, prepare to attack. *blast* machu mech, with ultimate photon stream of destruction..  trey: whoooooooooaaaaaa. quatro: trey*no*...  kite: nowi'm gonna take *you* down, quatro.  kite: neo galaxyeyes, attack..  end <<21:28 * special thanks to animeratio.com for the copy of this episode transcribed online. * special thanks to yugioh wikia as a source for checking cards. * special thanks to kazuki takahashi, 4kids, et al. for yugioh. zexal. last updated: january 28, 2013 i don't own yugioh zexal, at all, and this transcript is unofficial and without any permission whatsoever. please link back to me if you use my work. for more information about my transcript format, please click here. read my blog post on this episode here  )
