  act 1 <2:11>  striker: *let's duel.* after all, this soccer ball picked*you*.  striker: now there's *no going back*. yuma: huh. is this guy for *real*.  striker: yeah, i'm for *real*. and you're in *real trouble*, 'cause if you think i have skills when it comes to kicking it, just wait 'til you see the moves that i make out on the *duel field*. yuma: are those *cards* on there. striker: now.. put up your heart piece and let's go.. yuma: aw, yeah.. i like your style.  straight to business. ohheyi'm yuma tsukumo. who're *you*. striker: the name is *striker*. kazwell: did he say *striker*. tori: you know him. kazwell: *maybe*. that name sure sounds familiar.  all right, here we *go*. this is so exciting. striker: time to kick this carnival off.. <3:00> yuma: then let's do this. 'cause i'm feelin' the flow..  yuma: duel diskgo.  yuma: now, time to set my sights on *winning*. duel gazerlet's roll.  computer: augmented reality vision link established.  yuma and striker: now let's duel. yuma: since *you* challenged, i'll make the first move. i draw.  yuma: and it'll be a quick one. i'll just play one monster facedown in defense mode. astral: gogogo golem, played in defense mode. smart move. with all the trashtalk our fancyfootworking friend was kicking up, *i* figured you would foolishly go on the attack. clearly, i am rubbing off on you. yuma: rrrrggghhh, ya know.. if ya keep taking the credit, i'll attack *you*. striker: i dunno who you're *talking to* over there, but i know that after my first moveyou won't be talking to *anyone*, 'cause you're gonna be *speechless*. here we go.  i draw.. <4:00> just what i was hoping, it's the field spell card known as, "stadium of dreams".  yuma: you're *kiddin'* me.  tori: this is *not* my look.  cathy: so. cool. it's like we're at a soccer game. kazwell : indeed it is. and it looks like we're gonna be the ones calling it in front of *all these fine people*. and if their cheers are any sign, i'd say this *stadium of dreams* is their *dream come true*..  yuma: whoa. ththis can't be. striker: it can and it is. and there's more, too, 'cause now stadium of dreams switches all facedowns in defense mode to faceup. yuma: what....   striker: but *i'm not finished*. <5:00> next i summon wing captain.   striker: now. captain, attack.. yuma: just eleven hundred attack points. sorry, but cappy's totally outranked by gogogo. striker: not once i activate the spell card "perfect pass". *take it*, wing captain.  striker: and take it *to* gogogo golem. 'cause now, since golem's defense points are greater than wing captain's attack points, my captain's attack points *double*.  yuma: you can doubleteam golem all you want, but it won' t matter. its special ability keeps it from being destroyed in battle once per turn. striker: oh, didn't i mention. perfect pass negates your monster's special ability. yuma: what.. striker: can you saygogogo*goooooooaaaaaal*...  <6:00> yuma: no fair. when you destroy a monster in defense mode, it's not supposed to take away any lifepoints. striker: it does when cappy's attack points are greater than your monster's defense points.  striker: don'tcha just *love* captain's special ability. yuma: ya know what *i'd* love. to last one more round with this guy. act 2 <6:16>  striker: i'm ending my turn with a facedown. your draw, yuma, if you dare. tori: fight on, yuma. after all, you have us to cheer you on.  tori and cheerleaders: rah, rah. kazwell: this broadcaster's with you too. cathy: hear that, yuma. we *all* believe in you. yuma: if *they* do... then i believe, too. all righti draw.   yuma: nice. i summon gagaga magician.  yuma: now, let's *kick it*, gagaga. attack wing captain. kazwell: great coaching. gagaga magician has fifteen hundred attack points, and wing captain's attack points are back to normal. so this is a mismatch.   cathy: all right, yuma. cathy and kazwell: goal... tori: nice play, yuma..  striker: that last goal is *negated*. kazwell: negated.. cathy: how come. astral: i smell a trap card... yuma: and it *stinks*. striker: tough luck, yuma, but as you can see, i've activated my facedown card, "offside trap". yuma: i see *now*... striker: and you're about to see wing captain come back, too, because with this card, my monster *isn't* destroyed and i also take *no damage*, plus your turn comes to an end. yuma: what.. so my turn's over now.. tori: no *way*. astral: observation number fifteen. soccer is a thinking man's game. you should stick to sleeping. yuma: hey. i'm doing the best i can here, okay.. striker: your best. is that what you call those weak moves. yuma: grr.. striker: it's my turni draw. first up, i'm summoning out top scorer.  astral: how did he summon a levelfive monster without a tribute. <8:00> yuma: yeah, you're *so* not allowed to do that. striker: ha. i am when the field spell "stadium of dreams" is out. it lets me summon top scorer without tributing another monster. yuma: no fair.. striker: now go ahead and strike away, top scorer. attack gagaga magician.  striker: and with your defense now in disarray, i'll take shot number two. wing captain, attack.  yuma: aaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh.  tori: yuma. cathy: i can't watch any more. striker: *guess what*. i'm not done. next i activate a spell card, and it's an *eyeful*, too. "eye contact". don't blink'cause now offside trap returns to my hand. next i place one card facedown, and end my turn. yuma: this is *some game plan* striker's come up with.  yuma : if that facedown he just threw was another offside trap, that means he'll stop *any attack i make* <9:00> yuma: and then my turn'll be over.  yuma: heyare you even *listening*. astral: of course i am listening, yuma. yuma: so whaddaya *think*. astral: i think you've summed it up well. things seem quite hopeless. yuma: that's your advice, 'things are hopeless'.. thanks a *ton*, coach, way to build up my confidence, here.. striker: oh yes, you *know* it's over. my sick skills have you *completely covered*. and there's not a *thing you can do about it*, yuma.  donavon. oh. and dempsey. amazing. kazwell: oh, my. kazwell : it's dempsey and donavon, the quickkicking brothers who play for heart land united.  cathy : but why are *they* here.  kazwell : wait just a minute. *now* i know why striker's name was so familiar. it's because he's *related* to dempsey and donavon. he's their kid brotherand third son  kazwell : to worldclass coach keller crosshit.  kazwell : talk about a family with some serious soccer skills. together they've won more championships than *anyone out there*.  yuma: so if you're such a *soccer stud*, why are you here in a *duel tournament*. striker: i'll *tell you* why. <10:00> 'cause i'm nothing like my two brothers *or* my father.  striker: d'you two hear that.. i'm a *duelist*, not a soccer player, because in a duel, there's no passing *or* assists. it's all about getting the job done *yourself*. somewhere somebody once said there's no 'i' in the word 'team'. well, in dueling, the word 'team' *doesn't exist*. and i *like* it that way. yuma: what're you talking about. striker: nnngghh. yuma: dueling is *all* about teamwork. astral: what are you *doing*, yuma. yuma: i'm setting striker straight, that's what. dueling's all about working *together*. striker: aw, gimme a break. yuma: think about it. wing captain and top scorer, they're not just *monsters*they're your *teammates*. striker: huh..... yuma: at least that's always been the way *i* look at the monsters i summon out. for that matter, how i look at *every card in my deck*. striker: *all your cards*.... teammates. astral: focus, yuma. it is *our* turn to draw now. yuma: oh yeah. hold on, why're you suddenly so anxious to draw. astral: because of you, yuma. that speech you gave has given me an idea<11:00> to *win*. act 3 <11:03>  astral: time to put on your rally cap, yuma, because it is comeback time. yuma: i don't have a capbut i'm all for the rally. my turn... draw.. and nowastral: i summon zubaba buster.  yuma: would you please not interrupt meeee.. i summon zubaba buster.   astral: and i will use the spell card "monster reborn" to summon back to the field gogogo golem. yuma: hey. you're *stealing all my lines*. astral: now, now, just consider this part of the whole 'teamwork' thing. yuma: yeahbut you forget, astral, *no one can see or hear you*. next up i'm activating the spell card "monster reborn". and i'll use it to bring back gogogo golem, in defense mode. striker: nngh. fine with *me*, because nothing you bring out can possibly beat my offside trap. <12:00> yuma: rrgh. hate to say it, but he's got a point there. astral: maybe, but you have got something better. activate the spell card cross attack from your hand. do it now.  yuma: of course. i activate the spell card, "cross attack". astral: now since we have two monsters on the field with the same number of attack points, one of them can attack striker directly.  striker: yaaaaaahhhh.  goooooooal.. striker: he scored a *goal* on me.... tori and cheerleaders: go, yuma, go. go, yuma, go. yeah. kazwell: what a dazzling display. cathy: you can say that again. in fact, *i'll* say it for youwhat a dazzling display. striker: all right. so you found out offside trap can't activate against direct attacksbig deal. astral: it *is* a big deal. after all, yuma, not only does striker now take damage from zubaba buster's attack, but the monster with the fewest attack points on his field is also destroyed. <13:00>  striker: wha. astral: true, zubaba buster pays a penalty of eight hundred attack points when it uses this ability astral: but that is a small price to pay, to destroy a monster. yuma: wait just a minutehere's *another* card i can useand i'll use it now. i play the spell, "extra blast". since a special ability destroyed your monster, you take five hundred points of damage.  gooooooooooal. cathy: it's all tied up now. kazwell: yuma's right back in this thing.  tori: way to go, yuma. yuma: ya see. that's what teamwork can *do* for ya. now to end my turni'll throw *this*.  striker: and i'll throw *up* if ya keep talking *teamwork*.  striker : i've *never* believed in it. fb striker: here. come on, i'm open. *pass it*.  fb striker: *now* look what you did..  fb striker: you shoulda kicked it to *me*. we might *lose* 'cause of you.. 'cause of you *all*... fb dempsey : what's with *him*.  fb striker : i'll just have to win *all by myself*.  i'm open.  striker, come on. pass it here. <14:00> fb striker : whyso you can *mess it up*. no way. i got this.  *he's* dempsey and donavon's younger bro. you wouldn't know it from his soccer skills. fb striker: rrrggghh... i guess we all know who was born with two left feet in *that* family, now, don't we, guys.  hey, are you okay, striker.  fb striker: i'm fine. it's all *you* guys that're the *problem*. this was all *your* fault. fb donavon: that's *enough*, striker.  fb donavon: the *truth is* that *you're* the one to blame. fb dempsey: and if you don't see why, then you don't have any business *being* here.  striker : it was on that day that i turned my back on soccer... and vowed to show my brothers that i was right. that i could be a champion without *anyone's* help.  striker: so *here i am*, yuma, doing exactly that, and *nobody's* going to stop me. especially not *you*. yuma: well ya know what. you're wrong. <15:00> striker: huh.. yuma: maybe i will stop you, maybe i won't. but just take a look at your deck. you haven't turned your back on soccer. it's *still your passion*. i meanevery card you have just flatout *screams* it. striker: rrrggh. that's *not true*. i'm over soccer now.. yuma: yet here we are, *dueling on a soccer field*that was formed with your card. c'mon, it's okay to admit ityou *still* love the game, don'tcha. striker: ... *do* i.... uh... guess i do have *some* soccer cards... mm.. it... it's *my turn*. here goes.  striker: *perfect*. yuma: uhoh... striker: straight from my hand, i'm summoning defending sweeper.   striker: and when stadium of dreams is on the field, it gains one full level.  striker: but i'm not done yet. i may not believe in teamwork, but i believe in this card. the spell "all for one". yuma: and there's another. these're *all* soccerthemed duel cards. <16:00> astral: and they could mean the end of us. since there are two monsters on the field with the same type and level, all for one allows striker to summon an additional monster from his graveyard, so long as it is the same type as the other two. yuma: aaaahhh. striker: suit up, wing captain, you're back in play..   striker: but not only does all for one bring the captain back, it also lets me give him *one extra level*. yuma: so now he has *three* levelfive monsters. but that meansstriker: that means i can now overlay levelfive top scorer, defending sweeper, and wing captain.  striker: and now that the overlay network has been createdi can xyz summon. come on out, playmaker.   cathy: twentysixhundred attack points.. kazwell: oh no, that's enough to eliminate yuma from the duel carnival. yuma: rrrggghhh.... act 4 <17:00> striker: come on out, playmaker.   cathy: twentysixhundred attack points.. kazwell: oh no, that's enough to eliminate yuma from the duel carnival. striker: now, playmakerattack zubaba buster. astral: yumayou have a trap to play. yuma: you bet i do, astral, and i'm gonna play it *right now*. i activate "half unbreak". gooo.  yuma: now zubaba buster won't get bustedso go ahead and *do your worst*.  yuma: and ya know the *best* part of half unbreak. it cuts the damage i take in half. striker: well *more* damage is coming your way. i activate playmaker's ability. now by using one overlay unit, playmaker's allowed to attack again.  striker: and this time it's gonna take on your *strongest monster*.  <18:00> yuma: go ahead'cause my strongest monster is gogogo golem, and like i toldja before, it can withstand one attack per turn.  striker: i'll just *attack it again*, then.  yuma: rrrrggghhh. striker: and i think i'll use my final overlay unit, for one *more* attack. zubaba buster's the only one left, so attack it, playmaker.  yuma: i don't think so, striker, 'cause half unbreak is still in play.  yuma: dyaaaaahhhhh. gooooooooaaaal...  tori: yuma, no.. yuma: it's cool, tori. i'm fine. actually, i'm not just *fine*, i'm *great*. and you know *why*, striker.
