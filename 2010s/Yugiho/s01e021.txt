into making these wooden statues. every time one of my little birdies flies from the nest, i carve a new one in his or her honor. yuma: 'little birdies'. roku: yes. my students, my protgs. this historical duel sanctuary's a training house, a place of *knowledge*. many incredible duelists have mastered their art in this very room. tori: wow, that is *so cool*. and so're these *statues*. they look like they're about to *move*.  roku: but they *do* move. yuma: no, they *don't*. are you serious. <8:00> roku: i *am*. during a duel, these statues come to life.  roku: do you want to *see*. mmm.  yuma: get set to get decked, oldtimer.  computer: augmented reality vision link established.  yuma and roku: let's duel..  roku: in this duel training scenario, two legends have already been summoned to each of our fields. over here, i've got blueeyes statue dragon, and redeyes statue dragon. *you* have statue dark magician, and statue dark magician girl. the decks we're using are wooden training decks, made by *yours truly*.  roku: now. the four legendary monsters on our fields *remain* as wooden statues.   roku: their powers are *sealed away*. they have zero attack points. they cannot engage in battle.   yuma: they *what*.. so you were *kidding* when you said they could move.. <9:00> roku: you could *say* they can move. you can believe that they cannot. that choice is yours to make.  yuma: uuhhaaah. astral : i see. the potential of these monsters depends on the decisions yuma makes.  astral: yuma*you have the power* to bring them to life. yuma: huh. but he justastral: one of the cards in your deck must be the key to unlocking their powers.  yuma: so you mean... *oh*.. *i* get it.  roku : should i get comfy. maybe make myself some tea. yuma: back on your feet, gramps, 'cause here i go. i draw..  yuma: whoasweet. i'm activating, the "statue zone" field spell.  roku: oh. yuma: this field spell removes the seal placed on all statue monsters.  <10:00> yuma: come on, everyonelet's *feel the flow*..  dark magician: hm.  yuma: *this is so amazing*...  yuma: hoohooooo. legendary monsters are officially *in the house*. bronk : this is like, the greatest thing i've ever seen, ever.  yuma: all right, dark magicianlet's do this. attack his redeyes. dark magic attack.  roku: haha. not too shabby, little scrapper. yuma: aw, *yeah*. this is so great. roku: question.  <11:00> roku: you may've made a monster *move*, but can you truly *move* a monster.  yuma: whadda you talkin' about. i just destroyed redeyes with dark magician. roku: hmm. perhaps you need a *new perspective*. yuma: huh.  yuma: ohhhhhh....  yuma : what's....  yuma : what's goin' on..  yuma : what'm i *holding*. this looks like....  yuma : *i'm dark magician*. act 3 <11:37>  yuma : *i'm dark magician*. easy, now*good* dragon...  yuma : whoa. that'sthat's *me*.  yuma : no *way*. astral: this is quite an interesting scenario. yuma : this is *really freaking me out*. <12:00> roku: *look alive*, sonny, 'cause it's *my turn* now. i activate a spell"polymerization".  roku: and now i fuse three blueeyes white dragons from my graveyard  and hand to fusion summonblueeyes ultimate statue dragon..   roku: haha. now, my ultimate dragon, attack dark magician girl. neutron blast attack.  dark magician girl: aaaaaaaahhhhh.  yuma: dark magician girl...  roku: haha. next i activate the "defusion" spell card from my hand. so by sending my blueeyes ultimate dragon to my extra deck, it splits apart, and now i have three blueeyes white dragons again. <13:00>  yuma: uuaaahhh. wait. don't do it.  yuma: don't attack. uunnhhh....  roku: *yes*... when staring into the eyes of a powerful foe, you *tremble in fear*. it's only natural.  roku: our monsters are *no different*.  roku: they are forced to confront their fears every time *we duel*.  roku: feel the terror. buckle under the *weight* of your fear. tremble, as my blueeyes attack you directly.  roku: go, white lightning..  tori: he lost. roku: i may've pushed you a *little too hard*...  roku: but you *felt* it, didn't you. yuma: huh. <14:00> roku: you felt the fear a monster must wrestle with every time you summon it to battle in *your name*. when you learn to make that fear your own, and when you master how to tame it, *only then* will you truly be able to move a monster. yuma: ah, i can't believe it. i never really knew.... i always figured monsters weren't afraid of *anything*. but that's not true.  yuma: they're just like me.  bronk: this is *boring*.  bronk: *yuma*, weren't we gonna go catch a *movie* today. yuma: if you guys wanna take off, go ahead. i think i'm gonna stick around a little longer.  yuma: these statues won't clean themselves. tori: in that case, i'll whip up some breakfast. bronk: waitbut.  we were *s'posed* to go to a *movie*...  tori: 'morning.  yuma: heyhow did *this* happen. roku: ah.  yuma: this statue's all messed up right here. it's... it's almost like it was *cut in half* and put back together. did someone *break this* once. why would anyone *do* that.   roku : that boy has a good spirit. he's a diamond just *waiting to shine*.  roku: he's the opposite of *him*.   roku: it's... it's *you*. kaze: yes it is... *master*.  kaze: i'm back. act 4 <15:54>  kaze: didn't think you'd see me again, did you. <16:00> roku: i did notafter all, i said you were never to come back here. kaze: you told me a *lot of things*, old man.  kaze: but *words are cheap*.  roku and kaze: let's duel..   yuma: hey, uh, can i help you.  kaze: and who are you. yuma: uhhhh, aaaahhhh... roku: yuma..  yuma: what happened.. roku: *get away*, my boy. yuma: uh, away from what.  yuma: you mean *this guy*. who is he. roku: kazea former pupil of mine.   fb kaze: ugh....  fb roku: you lose again.  fb roku: and you will *keep* losing if you let your anger blind you. i *told* you not to play that card, *why* did you not *listen*.. <17:00> you will never control the darkness inside you unless you fb roku: kaze. don't listen to your rage.  fb roku: kaze..  fb roku: ah.... leave this place. *now*.  fb kaze: one day i will defeat you, and the legendary deck will be mine..  kaze: that day has finally arrived, roku. *i'm* the master now. *where's the deck*. roku: i think i *accidentally* threw it away. kaze: you think i'm *joking*.. roku: your spirit's been corroded by darkness. you don't deserve to *even look* at the legendary deck.. kaze: yaaaaaggghhh...  kaze: i'll destroy everything here if i have to. yuma: oh no you won't*..  roku: yuma, no..  kaze: *walk away*, you runt. <18:00> this does not concern you. yuma : yeah it does'cause roku... *roku is my master*..  roku: use what i have taught, and victory will be yours. kaze: ha. i guess that senile old fool will take *anyone* in. yuma: whatever you're after, you're gonna have to go through *me* to get it. kaze: is that so. that *won't* be a problem. yuma: duel diskgo.  yuma: duel gazer, let's roll.  computer: augmented reality vision link established. yuma and kaze: let's duel.. tori: i have a bad feeling about this. astral: i am right by your side, yuma. yuma: guh*astral*. i thought i was on my *own* for this one. astral: i believe that i have a lot to learn from this old man. that makes *me* his student, too. yuma: then let's *school* this fool. it's my turn. i *draw*. i summon, gagaga magician.  <19:00> yuma: next, i place one card facedown and end my turn. kaze: what a joke. *i* draw.  kaze: i summon, flame armor ninja.   kaze: then from my hand, i activate the spell card "armor ninjitsu art of teleportation". the power of this card allows me to summon a ninja monster from my hand. behold. air armor ninja.   kaze: due to teleportation's effect, my ninjas can't attack. *however*... yuma: i don't think i like where *this* is going. kaze: i *can* overlay flame armor ninja and air armor ninja.  kaze: with these two monsters, i build the overlay network and xyz summon, blade armor ninja.  <20:00>  yuma: yikes. *that* didn't take long, did it, astral. astral: no it did *not*. and that is worrisome. kaze: and now, blade armor ninja, attack gagaga magician.  yuma: that's not happenin' on *my* watch. i play the trap "gagagashield". now my magician can use this shield to protect itself.  yuma: nice try, ninjapants. but my gagaga isn't gogogoing *anywhere*. kaze: perhaps, but you will still feel its sting.  kaze: and now, by using an overlay unit, blade armor ninja can attack again.  kaze: and once again, *you* take damage.  yuma: whoa.  tori: yuma..  <21:00> kaze : poor fool. if you hadn't tried to protect your monster, *you* wouldn't've taken any damage at all.  yuma: uuuaagh. my monsters are my friends. they're not just things who *battle for me*. they're a *part of me*.  yuma: they've got my back and i've got theirs. roku: aahh.... kaze: your *friends*. if you wanna believe something so pathetic go ahead, but that kind of thinking will lead you to your undoing. yuma: ya *think so*.. well then give me all you've got and let's *find out*..  end <21:32> * special thanks to animeratio.com and toonzaki.com for the copies of this episode transcribed online. * special
