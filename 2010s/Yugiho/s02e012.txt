'cause i'm activating lucky straight's special ability. when lucky straight battles, i can use one overlay unit to roll the dice.  charlie: and then, lucky straight's attack points get multiplied by the number that comes up. so if luck is on my side, this could be the end, my friend.  charlie: whoohoo.  charlie: now we just multiply lucky straight's seven hundred attack points by six.  charlie: and then, this one's in the books. it can't be..  daaahh.  charlie : the rumors about this card were true... it's *incredible*.  charlie : just hope the luck it brings holds out until tomorrow... when i *really* need it.  yuma: that was *amazing*. a *huge comeback* in *one turn*.   astral : but *so much* of that comeback depended on chance. interesting.  astral: seven thousand seven hundred seventysix to one. those are the odds that he was facing.  you cheated. i know it. *nobody* rolls that many sixes in a row.  tori: what's *this* all about.  charlie mckay. you are completely surrounded. there's no getting away *this* time. charlie: that's pretty much what they said *last* time i got away. put your hands on the back of your head.  charlie: whatever you say...  charlie: here's the *problem* though, fellas. there's somethin' i gotta do. i don't really have time to *hang out*.  charlie: it's showtime.  charlie: all right, people. who's up for a *game of chance*.  yuma: ahh. astral: yuma.  astral: your number card.  astral: yuma. look up. yuma: huh. iiiigh. astral: you mightwant to run.  act 3 <<15:30  astral: yuma. look up. yuma: huh. iiiigh. astral: you mightwant to run.  yuma: whawhat's he doing..  yuma: ah.  everybody okay.  'm fine, officer. yeah. thank you so much.  huh.. tori: what's happening.  how is he *doing* that.. he should put those back. that's against the law.  charlie: good thing i was standing *here*.  charlie: this *donut* coulda *hurt* me.  charlie: *seriously*. i mean, talk about *close calls*, right. but heyclose calls make life more fun.  charlie: and since life is a carnival, the more fun i have, the better. and hey, yumawhen your sister gets here, tell 'er i'm sorry i had to bolt.  yuma. hey. i'm not just gonna let you *run off with my card*, come back.. tori: yuma, wait.  yuma: ahh. huh.  kari: *please* tell me the donut wasn't your fault. yuma: it *wasn't*. kari: *where is he*.  yuma: he's, uh... gone.  kari: so he stole everyone's cards and then took *off*. i don't *believe* that guy. and to *think* i actually took some time to make him food...  yuma: so d'you think that crazy *card* he dueled with is what he stole from the museum. kari: sounds like it. i heard them talking about the card on the heart land frequencies, and so i did some quick *research*. everyone who's ever had that card has been blessed with a sudden streak of crazy luck. in the past few months, that card has turned people into overnight celebrities and millionaires. tori: that's nuts. yuma: he totally acted like he *knew who i was*. who *is* this guy, sis. kari: charlie mckay was dad's assistant.  kari : he helped him with his research and went on a few excavations with him. and then, basically decided to become a big *blockheaded buffoon* who flies all over the world looking for *ancient shiny things*.   kari: every time i think i'm never gonna *see* him again... he has this way of showing up.  kari: wellall right, you two, you guys up for a little *recon*. yuma: yeah. we'll find this guy. we'll turn this whole city upsidedown if that's what it takes.  yuma and kari: let's do this.  yuma: all right, tori, let's start looking. astral: do you have any leads. yuma: huh. astral: if you search randomly, you will *never* find him. yuma: whadda *you* suggest, knowitall.. astral: at first, i was not sure why i recognized those words. and then, i realized... astral : eightysixth district, seventh area.  astral : i have seen those words while riding the d line monorail with you.  astral : they spin around at the top of a building. i admit that this might be what you would call, 'kind of a stretch'...  astral : but it might be worth looking along that rail line. perhaps if we explore the surrounding areas, we will find this *charlie mckay*, and retrieve your number card.  yuma: what's goin' on..  tori: looks like the police are heading toward the bay area. the d line goes through there. it's him. it's *gotta* be.  act 4 <<18:51  lieutenant. we've stopped the monorail and evacuated all passengers and personnel. the suspect is surrounded.  get down on your knees, mckay. charlie: man, you guys just *do not give up*, do ya.  charlie: did your bosses not give you the *memo* about what this card can do.  hey. the monorail's closed.  charlie: no hard feelings, boys, but, i've really got somewhere i need to *be*.  something's wrong. our controls're *jammed*.  suspect is on the westbound d rail, moving through the bay area.  yuma: kari, i've got 'im.  yuma: we're on the d line monorail.  kari: i'm on my way. charlie: so ya found me. little quicker than i thought you would. yuma: you took my card. i'd like to have it back. charlie: eheheh. direct and to the point. well, as it happens, i've jammed this monorail so it can't be stopped by the control center, and i'm afraid our destination is all the way on the other side of the city. so, uh... whaddayou say we pass the time with a little *duel*. yuma: a duel. charlie: an' if you manage to win, then i'll give you your card back.  astral: yuma... you have to retrieve that number card. yuma: all rightlet's do it. duel disk, go.  yuma: duel gazerlet's roll.  computer: duel interface set. authentic reality vision link established.  tori: be careful, yuma.  yuma and charlie: let's duel.  kari: what's yuma doing on top of that monorail.. tori: is this the best time to be doing this.. yuma: this guy took my number card, and i'm getting it back, tori. tori: that's nice and all, but if this monorail can't be stopped, then who's supposed to hit the brake.. yuma: who's supposed to hit the.... *brake*.. daaahh. someone help me.. charlie : don't be *scared*, yuma. nothing *bad* will happen. luck is gonna protect us. so let's get this duel started.  end <<22:05 * special thanks
