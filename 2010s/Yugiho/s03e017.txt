  kite : the time has come, hart.  kite: i made it through to the semifinals. it won't be long now 'till i collectugh.  kite: ahuhugh.  orbital: master kkite. please. you can't cccontinue hunting numbers, if you ddo i'm afraid of what might hapkite: i'm not gonna stop until i've made vetrix *pay* for what he's done, got that..  act 1 <<0:31  mr. heartland: in our first semifinals duel, the winner was an *unexpected* onethe *underdog duelist* yuma tsukumo.. bronk: keep it up, yuma. cathy: yay. tori: all right. mr. heartland: yuma will take on the winner of the *upcoming* semifinals duel. now let's meet the two who'll fight in our next faceoff.  mr. heartland : with a past shrouded in mystery, not much is known about him... mr. heartland: except that his *dueling skills* leave the competition speechless. give it up for the *masked dueling marvel*, *vetrix*..  mr. heartland: and, ready to face 'ima *remarkable* young man said to have *never lost a match* in his life. put your hands together mr. heartland: for *kite tenjo*...  mr. heartland : hart and i are counting on you.  *don't* let us down, kite. you *do* want to help your little brother hart, *don't you*.  yuma: kite.  yuma: i'm totally rootin' for ya to win. 'cause *a*, i wanna take you on one more time. and *b*, vetrix is a *real creep*. so duel the *pants* off 'im, will ya.  kite: hello, *astral*.  yuma: did he say *astral*.. astral: i'm listening.  kite: i'll see you and yuma in the finals.  yuma : he didn't mention me, right.  uh, good catchin' up.  mr. heartland: now that both duelists have arrived, we'll *elevate* the stakes and take this duel to the next level, in our stateoftheart *sky field*..   yuma: haha. *this* i gotta see. astral: yuma, where are you going. yuma: hnhn. to get a good *view*.  yuma: nngghh. help. get me up.. uaaaaaaaaaaaahhh, nnnnnn...  orbital: uaaaahhhh.. yuma, geget lost..  orbital: yyymmrrryyymmmmrrrmmm... kite : help 'im up, orbital. let 'im see how a *real* champion duels. act 2 <<2:43 mr. heartland: the duel of the century is about to commence, but who will go home the winner.  mr. heartland: will it be vetrix. or will it be kite. if i had a seat, i'd be on its *edge*.  yuma: go, kite. let 'im have it. haha. orbital : yes, let 'im have it. as ccautiously and carefully as you can... yuma: huh. orbital : oh dear.  vetrix: eheheheh... heheheheh... kite: what's so *funny*. vetrix: i just find it so *very amusing*that my nemesis is *spying* on me right now. but *try as he might*, he *can't manage to cloak his presence*.   vetrix : i know you're watching, faker. i *do hope* you're enjoying the show. faker: vetrix. or rather, byron. it's hard to believe you returned. even more curious is that your body took on such a *peculiar* form.  dr. faker: but your childlike shape and size are unimportant to me. what *is* important, however, is seeing you *crushed*. kite: vetrix, this moment is long overdue.  kite : i'm here to avenge what you've done to my brother hart.  kite: this i *promise*so get ready for some *payback*. vetrix: now, nowtemper, temper. what if i told you that i have a special surprise *just for you*. would that cheer you up a bit. kite: enough of your nonsense. go. photon transformation.  computer: augmented reality vision link established. kite and vetrix: let's duel..  kite: i think *i'll* start things off, vetrix.  here goes. i summon, photon crusher..  kite: then i'll equip photon crusher with this, the spell "photon spear". prepare for punishment, because the monster equipped with photon spear counts as *two* monsters instead of one.  yuma: photon crusher just became *double* the trouble. kite: now i tribute my two photon crushers.  kite: i summon the mighty galaxyeyes photon dragon.    yuma: what's with him. orbital: mmmmmaster kkkite.. vetrix: eheheheh.  kite: ugh. i place one card facedown and end my turn. it's your move.  vetrix: ehehahahaha. my, it seems your little 'photon transformation' nonsense is *quite taxing*. you're not in very good *shape*, *are* you.  vetrix: *actually*, that's putting it lightlyi'm surprised you're still standing.  vetrix: eheheheheheh. yuma : what's going on.  kite's *okay*, right.  orbital: mmph. no comment. vetrix: it's *my turn*. i draw. i summon, heraldic beast basilisk.  vetrix: next, i'll equip the spell "heraldry blast"onto *your* galaxyeyes photon dragon. kite: huh. what.. yuma: why'd he equip kite's monster with his own spell.  vetrix: heraldic beast basilisk. attack kite's galaxyeyes.  yuma: wait, hold on. basilisk has only one thousand attack points. it's no match for galaxyeyes and its *three* thousand attack points.  vetrix: heheheheheh. good math. but due to basilisk's special ability, if basilisk is destroyed, so is the monster that's battling it.  vetrix: now, when kite's galaxyeyes photon dragon is destroyed, kite here takes half its attack points as damage. yuma: i hate to admit it, but even *kite* may not be strong enough to take down vetrix. vetrix: now, kite. prepare for the beginning of your *end*.  act 3 <<7:19  vetrix: and now, kite, prepare for the beginning of your *end*. kite: i don't think so. because i'm *stopping* that attack. i activate galaxyeyes's special ability. both of our monsters are now *banished*.  astral: by banishing galaxyeyes, he removed heraldry blast from his monster. quite incredible, i must admit. yuma: aw, yeah, you go, kite. kite: now that the battle is over, *both* our monsters return to the field.  vetrix: i place one card facedown. and endmy turn.  vetrix: well done, kite. i admit your dueling is *quite impressive*.  vetrix: *amazing*, in fact, considering the sorry state your body is in at the moment. putting your own health at risk and hunting numbers to save your brotherhow *valiant* of you, kite. yours is such a *noble* goal. i *also* have a *little goal of my own*. i've sworn to have my vengeance on your fatherdoctor faker.. i'm not sure you *know this*, but it was *faker* who *betrayed* me.  vetrix : leaving me adrift in the limbo between two worlds. as a result, my body took the form you see here today.   vetrix: byron ceased to be and vetrix was born. it was at that moment that i was consumed  vetrix : by a singleminded objective. to take my revenge on your father.. vetrix: revenge is my reason for being and i'll sacrifice anything at my disposal to obtain it. kite: you mean anything or any*one*. even your son, quinton.. vetrix : ohdon't be so *selfrighteous*. in your pursuit of numbers you've sacrificed *countless* human souls.  vetrix: of course you did it all for your *dear little brother hart*. but nevertheless, my point is cleareven though our motives are different, you and i are *alike*.  yuma: whoa, d'ja hear *that*. kite : i'm *nothing like you*. vetrix: huh. kite: being compared to you and even *looking* at you make me sick.. so i'm gonna skip straight to *beating* you. now it's my turni draw. i summon, photon satellite.  kite: this card gains the level of any photon monster on my fieldlike galaxyeyes. its leveleight, so now *photon satellite*, becomes level *nine*. and when i use photon satellite to xyz summon, it counts as *two* monsters. so i overlay my two levelnine photon satellites.  kite: with these two monsters, i build the overlay network, and xyz summonnumber nine, dyson sphere.   bronk: what *is* that thing.... cathy: ah....     vetrix: how did kite come to have *this* card. kite: i got it from *quinton*. your own son will help lead to your downfall. i equip galaxyeyes with photon wing, to further strengthen my dyson sphere strategy.  kite: now, once per turn, i can select an xyz monster on my field. i choose dyson sphereso now my galaxyeyes absorbs all of dyson sphere's overlay units.  kite: *and* if gains attack points equal to dyson sphere's rankmultiplied by two hundred points. dyson sphere is rank nine. so galaxyeyes gains eighteen hundred attack points.  kite: to make things *worse* for you, photon wing allows galaxyeyes to attack you directly.. yuma: so that'll mean a direct attack with fortyeight hundred attack points. awesome. he'll win the duel for sure. orbital: *and* master kikite will be able to *rest* 'till the next duduel. kite: now, this is it, galaxyeyes. attack vetrix with photon stream of destruction..   yuma: *unbelievable*...  kite: ah, it's over... vetrix: hahahahahahahahahahaha.  kite: what.. this can't be. how can you have *any lifepoints* left. yuma: yeah, what's goin' on here, huh. how is it that vetrix is still standing. vetrix: hmhmhmhmhmhmhmhm...  astral: *there* is the reason. he activated the trap "heraldry change".  vetrix: heraldry change allows me to summon a heraldic beast, and then i take one thousand points less damage for every level that monster has. i summoned heraldic beast aberconway, which is *levelfour*.  kite : so you decreased the damage you would take by four thousand points. vetrix: yes. are you shocked. because i assure you, you haven't seen *anything* yet. because, kite... i've been saving a *little surprise* for you all this time.  vetrix: and it'll take this duel to a *whole new level*..  act 4 <<13:04  vetrix: ready for your surprise, kite.  vetrix/hart : why do you keep attacking me.  vetrix/hart : it hurts, kite.  vetrix/hart : this is all *your* fault, big brother.   vetrix/hart : you promised you'd help me get better, kite.  vetrix/hart : but i've gotten a lot worse, just look at me. yuma: this is all *kinds* or weird. astral: yes... you are correct.  dr. faker: rrgghh. what madness is this..  kite: vetrixi knew you were low, but i didn't know how much lower you could sink. but by hiding behind my kid brother you've hit *rock bottom*. so that's it*i won't stand for this anymore*..  vetrix/hart : are you angry. kite: vetrix, stop playing games.. vetrix/hart : i'm not vetrix, it's me, your brother hart. kite: stop pretending to be hart... vetrix/hart : oh no, you've got it wrong, i'm not playing makebelieve.  vetrix/hart : i'm really hart, and hart is me. kite: uuugghhh...  vetrix/hart : remember when i *kidnapped hart*. how silly of meof course you do.  vetrix/hart : well, when that happened, i absorbed all of hart's power and memories. fb hart: aaaaahhhh.....  kite: impossible.  vetrix/hart : no, it's true. our minds joined together  and we became one. i'll prove it, look up here.  kite: hart, it's me.. vetrix/hart : save your breath, he can't hear you. now say, for instance, i give myself a little pinch. hart can feel it too.  kite: stop, vetrix... dr. faker: my *dear boy*.... someone get to hart's room and check on him *now*..  we're locked out. we can't access hart's room.  the door is *jammed*. dr. faker: he's gone too far. vetrix must be stopped.  vetrix/hart : it *hurts*, kite. can't you make it stop, *pleeease*. kite: listen up, vetrix. i'm *done* playing this silly game of yours. this duel's *over*. vetrix/hart : i don't think so.  this battle's just getting started, kite.  vetrix/hart : ha. yeah.  vetrix/hart : didn't you *hear* me. i *wish* i didn't have to force you to duel, but you've simply left me no other choice. yuma: hey, kite. i'll find hart and free 'im from vetrix. you just stay here and work on making sure you win this duel, okay. kite : i *plan* on it. yuma: let's go, orbital. orbital: ayeaye, cacacaptain.  yuma: hang on, harthere we come..  yuma: whaaaaaaa.  vetrix/hart : yuma is *such* a pest.  now, *where were we*.  oh, yes vetrix/hart : it's my turn, i draw. i overlay levelfour aberconway and basilisk.  vetrix/hart : with these two monsters, i build the overlay network. and xyz summon, number eightheraldic king genomheritage.   kite: so vetrix... is dueling with a number card.... vetrix/hart : now i activate heraldic king genomheritage's special ability. by using one overlay unit, i can select one of its *three* special abilities.  vetrix/hart : when genomheritage battles your monster, your monster's attack points drop to *zero* until the end of the turn. ohand where do those attack points *go*. they become *genomheritage's* attack points. kite: your monster will be unstoppable. vetrix/hart : yes, that's rightand now i'll attack *dyson sphere*.  vetrix/hart : dyson sphere's attack points have dropped to *zero*. and my genomheritage's attack points soar to twentyeight hundred.. kite: that move may not work out the way you'd hoped. because if you attack dyson sphere when it has no overlay units, it gets back *all* the overlay units it lost, and then *stops* any attack you may have started. vetrix/hart : oh, what a pity. i'll just have to use my *second* overlay unit to select its *next* special ability. remember how genomheritage stole your monster's attack points. well, genomheritage steals your monster's *special abilities*. haha. kite: you've taken away all of my monster's powers.... vetrix/hart : that's right. and now i'm taking away your *lifepoints*.  hahahahahahahahahaha.  go, genomheritage. attack his dyson sphere.. flash impact..  vetrix/hart : i place one card facedown and end my turn.  that was *fun*.  vetrix/hart : but the fun won't stop *there*, wait 'til you see what i have in store *next*.  vetrix/hart : you see, now we'll begin to *feel* each attack. so the stakes have just gotten more interesting. so when you strike at *me*...  vetrix/hart : you attack your *poor, defenseless little hart*.  kite: *now* what will i do.  vetrix/hart : the *real* question you need to ask yourself is, are you willing to harm hart to beat *me*. kite: i won't do it. i will *never* hurt hart. vetrix/hart : well, looks like you'll *have to*.  just go easy on me, okay, kite. hahahahahahahahaha.   yuma: i'm comin'. hang in there. i *will* rescue you, hart. dr. faker: vetrix..  vetrix/hart : enjoying the show, faker. ingenious, isn't it. you're about to watch both your sons get crushed in the same duel. vetrix/hart : hmhmhm... and i won't go *easy* on 'em, *either*.  vetrix/hart : hahahahahahahahahahahaha.. end <<19:23 * special thanks to animeratio.com for the copy of this episode transcribed online. * special thanks to yugioh wikia as a source for
