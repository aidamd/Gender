 crashbug x: bug. crashbug. crashbug.  heheheheheh, time to go *viral*...  crashbug x: crashbug. crash. bug. crashbug.   crashbug x: crash. bug. crashbug. buggy buggy buggy bug.  crashbugs: crashbug. bbug. crashbug. bbug. crashbug. litterbot: reinitializing. trash identified.  grandma: what a niceaahh. aaahh.  litterbots: trash identified... grandma: what is the meaning of this.. put me down at once.  yuma: didn't i tell you to get lost already, astral.. astral: you did. <1:00> but, i do not understand what you mean by that.  astral: how can one *consciously* get lost. if i go somewhere, i will know where i am. yuma: it's a *figure of speech*, it means 'beat it', 'leave', 'go away'. astral: i *can't* until you gather the numbers.  yuma: what about *you*.. yuma: what do *i* have to do with anything.. why do *i* have to gather your *dumb numbers*..  bronk: there goes yuma, having another argument wit' himself. tori: maybe there really *is* an invisible duelist following him around. yuma : ...following me around like a *lost puppy*..  yuma: i *know* you're not a dog, it's just an expression..  yuma: ah, never mind. forget this. tori: or maybe *not*. yuma : it means i'm not gonna talk to you anymore. tori: maybe he just fell on his head.  astral: observation number two. when asked to do something, humans behave erratically. yuma: rrrgghh, *stop using big words*. kari: aaaaauuuuaaagghhhh...  yuma: it sounded like my sister.  yuma: what's wrong, kari. kari: my research.... my *transcripts*.... my big scoop.  kari: some kind of bug just wiped out my computer. yuma: okay, let's *try to stay calm*...  kari: my deadline is tomorrow.... <2:00> yuma : mount kari's about to blow.... tori : we *might* wanna get outta here.  kari: *hey yuma*.. go find me a new scoop, *or else*...  act 1 <3:08>  yuma: ugh, how does kari expect *me* to find her a scoop. why hasn't traffic moved in, like, *ten minutes*. bronk: uh, *nothing* is moving. look at the monorail. tori: something's going on.  yuma: you guys hear that. hey, check it outthe vending machine's tossing out juices all by itself.. tori: wait a second, yuma tori: you can't take those, you didn't pay for them. litterbot: trash identified. trash identified. trash identified.  yuma: whaaaa. get me outta here. ugh, *what is that smell*.  litterbot: trash contained. trash contained.  newscaster : alyssa brianna filed this report regarding the sweeping kari: i don't wanna hear about anyone *filing reports*.  yuma: thanks for the grub, grandma.  kari: why did my computer *trash my report*. yuma: speaking of trash, one of those litterbots scooped me up today. grandma: the same thing happened to *me*. kari: wait, wait, *what*.  yuma: downtown was *crazy* today.  yuma : traffic lights were wonky, the monorail got stuck, <4:00> vending machines were just *spitting out juices*. grandma: the radio said everything's back to normal, now. kari: so, wait. i'm not the *only one* whose computer got *wiped out*. yuma: guess not. kari: something stinks.  kari: not *you two*. i smell a good story brewing. i've gotta replenish my energy and get cracking.  yuma: huh. hey, that's mine.  yuma: sis. sis.  kari: gotta go. yuma: huh.  astral: so this is how these humans *replenish their energy*...  astral: ...and you park your vehicles on something called a 'driveway'...   yuma: mmmgghh... astral: ...yet you drive them on something called a 'parkway'. yuma : would you *stop talking to me*.. just *go away*. astral: i am only seeking to better understand your behavior. yuma: i'm in a magical room right now. if you bother me while i'm in here, there's a chance i may*turn into a guinea pig*. astral: interesting.  astral : observation number three. <5:00> after replenishing their energy, humans retire to a private magical room, and if they are bothered while *inside* their magic room, they will transform into a rodent. yuma: *stop observing*.. astral: one more thing. you seem to be such a *complex and functional being*...  astral : so then, why do you always *malfunction* when it comes time to *duel*.  yuma: what is *that* supposed to mean. astral: your dueling is broken, and erroneous.  yuma: *go away*... nobody's perfect. don't you *get* that.. people are interesting *because* they can fail. astral: i do not understand that. failure is not an option for *me*.  yuma: ugh, but you won't be able to *achieve* anything of you're *afraid* to fail. my *dad says that*, and my dad is *awesome*so there.  yuma: and leave me *alone*, you floating flashlight..  astral: i cannot shake the thought, that i was sent to this world on an important mission. perhaps, in order to *fulfill* that mission, <6:00> i was supposed to take over yuma's body.  astral : but something went wrong.  astral : and my essence was shattered, into ninetynine *pieces*, ninetynine... *number* cards....  astral : if i have the power to take control of these humans, it stands to reason that each card containing a *piece* of me would have that power as well. the number seventeen certainly seemed to be controlling that boy they called 'shark'.  astral : but why was taking over *yuma* part of my mission.  astral : more importantly... what went *wrong*.  astral: what's happened..  astral: where... *am i*.... act 2 <6:45>  crashbug x: crashbug.  scary voice: yes, let the number take hold....  crashbug xs: crash. bugabugabug. crashbug. crashbug. crashbug. <7:00>  yuma: ugh... huh. huh. huh. huh. looks like that astral finally took the hint.  yuma: oh noi'm late. again.   yuma: made it.  mr. kay: so i know we were going to spend today's class discussing the quadratic equation, and i know you were all looking forward to that, but unfortunately, due to yesterday's system hiccup, our systems are offline. extra credit for anyone who can find the source of this thing kazwell: excuse me, mister kay. but i can take this one. mr. kay: you... *know* i was being sarcastic, right, kazwell. kazwell: ahem. okay. pay attention, *simpletons*, because *some of this* might go over your heads. yesterday's incident was the result of a virus planted in the city's grid system by a hacker. *but*in the end, by pinging severalyuma : hey, since we can't talk about mathy stuff, let's have a *duel tournament*. mr. kay: well, that's not on the curriculum... but sure, why not. yuma: haha. <8:00> all right, mister kay.. i am totally feelin' the flow.  kazwell : that *uppity upstart* stole my spotlight. that does it..  kazwell: yuma.. i challenge you to a duel *here and now*. yuma: all right, get set to get decked. duel disk, go.  yuma: duel gazerlet's roll.  yuma and kazwell: duel interface set.  computer: augmented reality vision link established.  yuma and kazwell: let's do this. tori: show 'im what you're made of, yuma. kazwell : what *are* you made of, yuma. *i* heard you beat shark the other day. yuma: well, then you heard the truth. kazwell: i don't *believe* you. everyone knows shark is the best duelist around. bronk: believe it, kazwell, 'cause it's true. tori: we were right there, we saw it happen. kazwell: then according to the laws of transitive property... yuma: transawhaty. kazwell: beating you would mean that, in the end, *i* am the best duelist in school. yuma: i'm not sure i *buy* that logic, kazwell. <9:00> either way that's not gonna happen, 'cause i've got an *awesome number ca*huh.  yuma: where'd my number card go.. i had it this morning.. kazwell: what's the matter are you feeling the pressure already. yuma: waitasecond, just hang on, i'm not readyyyy..   kazwell: i summon crashbug x. crashbug x: crashbug.  crashbug x: bug. yuma: oh... kazwell: now zap his lifepoints.  yuma: what happened.  bronk: *that* was embarrassing... tori: you can say *that* again.  kazwell: ha. i bested you in one move. you never had a chance.  kazwell: in the end, there was no way an intellectuallychallenged amateur like you could defeat a *brilliant strategist* such as myself. yuma: what did you call me.. mr. kay: there's no need to boast, kazwell. kazwell and yuma: huh.  mr. kay: dueling is actually a *lot like life.* sometimes things go as we planned, other times we make mistakes and we get frustrated.  mr. kay: when that happens, you just have to feed your frustrations to crashbug. <10:00>  mr. kay: you guys know the legend behind crashbug, right. crashbug's this *little electrical spirit*, and he likes to zap what he calls 'bugs'. bugs are those feelings that get in our wayfrustration, doubtgive those bugs to crashbug and you can move past them and succeed. kazwell: that's *ridiculous*, mister kay. crashbug doesn't *actually exist*. mr. kay: of *course* it exists. i've seen it. kazwell: ah.  mr. kay: so what if you lost, yuma. the trick is to not let the frustration get to you. learn from your mistakes and keep moving forward. keep challenging yourself.  yuma: you got it, mister kay. i'm gonna keep at itthat's what feelin' the flow is all about.  yuma : isn't mister kay the coolest.  yuma: not only is he the awesomest, smartest math whiz i've ever met, but he's *super nice*, too. i wanna be *just like him* when i grow up.  yuma: huh. tori: huh.  kari: hey, doofus. what's up. yuma: whaddayou want, *sis*.  kari: hop in the car. let's go for a drive. <11:00>  kari: it's a good thing yesterday's virus attack only spread to a few remote servers.  yuma: why. what woulda happened if it had spread to *more*... remotecontrol... serving... thingies. kari : the entire city would've been *thrown into chaos*. yuma: whoathat sounds really serious. kari: forget about *traffic lights and litterbots*  kari : bank data would've vanished. people would've *lost their money*. vision crashbug x: crashbug.  kari : hospitals would've lost medical records and the ability to help people. it would've been a disaster. yuma: wow. are you serious.. tori: who would do such a terrible thing. kari: i have no idea. but i *do know* that the virus was transmitted from *your school library*. yuma and tori: what..  kari: so here's what we're gonna do. *i'm* gonna chase a few more leads. meanwhile *you two* are gonna stake out the library. tori: a stakeout sounds so exciting. yuma: why did i get *hungry* when you said that. kari: you're *always* hungry. but *don't let your appetite distract you*. i wanna track this hacker down and make him *pay* for deleting my big scoop. <12:00>  tori : so what was your sister's big scoop. yuma : ice cream.  tori: i'm *serious*. yuma: so am *i*. she discovered that the local ice cream parlor was a front for a criminal organization.  tori: *yuma*, we're supposed to keep our eyes open. yuma : there's nothin' to *see*.  tori: it's almost time for the library to close. yuma: maybe the sinister bad guy took the day off. or maybe it's a...  yuma: ...hacker holiday or something. tori: yuma. shh. *look*. isn't that....  yuma: kazwell. tori: yeahand he's acting suspicious.  tori: heywhat're you doing.  tori: that looks likesome kinda flash drive.  kazwell: ahh. but. i didn't mean to launch anything..  yuma: caught redhanded. now tell us why ya did it, ya criminal lowlife.  kazwell: unhand me. i'm not *behind* thisi'm *being used*.  yuma: don't try to lie.. i saw you upload the virus, and<13:00> um, what're you doing.  kazwell: i'm tracking the source of the rootkit. if i can pinpoint the location this machine was just accessed from, then we'll know where the criminal is andohh..  kazwell: this is not good. look, in the end i found an encrypted data packet that led me to believe i could access a file on this computer to learn who the criminal is, but it turns out the file was a detonator for some sort of computer virus and now it's kazwell: waiti'm onto something.  kazwell: there's our location..   kari: your friend triggered a countdown.. yuma: we sent you the access stuff. try to stop it. we're on our way to the bad guy's secret lair.  kari: but it could be dangerous. yuma: don't worry, sisi'll be fine. ... i think. act 3 <13:40>  kazwell: that tower under construction. the hacker should be in *there*.  yuma: maybe you were wrong about this place, kazwell.  kazwell: in the end, have i *ever* been wrong.  yuma: huh. mr. kay: you've *finally put the pieces together*. <14:00> took you a lot longer than i thought it would.  yuma: mister kay.. what're you doin' hangin' out *here*.  mr. kay: hmhmhmhmhm.... kazwell: don't you *get* it. in the end, *mister kay* is the criminal mastermind behind the malicious virus.  mr. kay: that's *one way* of putting it. yuma: butbut i was saying earlier how *awesome* you are, mister kay. i think i even said i wanted to be like you when i grow up. mr. kay: hmph. someone like you could *never* be like me. kazwell: i have to say, sirthis is disappointing. mr. kay: well, i'm sorry to disappoint you, kazwell. especially since i'm so proud of you for following my clues.  mr. kay: i wanted you all to be here when the virus went... well... *viral*. kazwell: are you saying you led us here *on purpose*..  yuma: a *number*.  astral: observation number four. this worldlike yumais a complex machine.  astral: ...but not as annoying. it is... complicated in design... like a *puzzle*.  astral: what is that.. it feels like a *number*.... <15:00>  mr. kay: hahahahaha. you cannot stop me.  yuma: i can't *believe* it.  astral: that human bears the mark of a number.  yuma: aah. i thought you went back to *saturn* or something. astral: you were incorrect.  yuma: so then where've you *been*.. where did you come from just now.. what are you.. kazwell : why is he talking to himself like that. yuma : whatever you are, don'ttori: all right. yuma's invisible duelist friend must've appeared to help 'im out. yuma: never mind, forget it. i'm gonna *ignore* you.  what's goin' on, mister kay.. why're you doing this..  mr. kay: this is my personal challenge to myself. like you, always trying to *feel the flow*. yuma: that's not the same thing.. feeling the flow isn't about causing trouble and hurting people.. astral: yuma, you must duel this man. yuma: huh. astral: one of the numbers has consumed his spirit. the only way to *reason* with him, is to break the number's hold. yuma : i challenge you to a dueland if you lose, then you have to stop the virus from going off.  mr. kay: you want to duel me..  <16:00> mr. kay: well, i am more than happy to agree to your conditions, *yuma*but why *d'you* think you can defeat me. well.. yuma: because now i'm feelin' the flow. let's do this. duel disk, go. duel gazer, let's roll.  computer: duel interface set.  computer: augmented reality vision link established. yuma and mr. kay: let's duel.  tori: i know you can win, yuma, haha.  kazwell: yuma *has* to winor else everyone'll think i'm some kinda *criminal*. mr. kay: i believe the first move is mine. i draw.  mr. kay: i place a monster facedown in defense mode. yuma: aw, great, a facedown. now i don't even know what i'm up against. mr. kay: so then try to attack me, and find out. yuma: i think i *will*. hah.  i summon, gagaga magician.  <17:00> yuma: hgh... wait, since i don't know what that *is*, maybe i shouldn't attack. hnnh... ahh, whatever, there's no point in thinking....  yuma: gagaga magician. attack mister kay. mr. kay: not a chance. crashbug x. show yourself.   crashbug x: crashbug.  yuma: agggh, ah man, i just got schooled.... tori: how come yuma lost lifepoints if his monster is just fine. kazwell: if you attack a monster in defense mode, the attacking monster isn't destroyed, even if the defending monster has higher defense points. thus, in the end, if you subtract the attack points from the defense points, yuma takes five hundred points of damage.  mr. kay: it's my turn now. i draw. first i summon crashbug y.   crashbug y: *crashbug*. mr. kay: and with that done, i activate the "crashbug road" spell card from my hand. nowwe each choose a levelfourorbelow monster on our fields. then we each summon a monster from our hands, <18:00> that has the same level as the monster we chose. i choose, crashbug z.   crashbug z: bug. yuma: 'kay. the only monster on my field is, gagaga magician. so that means... sweet.  yuma: i can summon gogogo golem. astral: i would highly advise summoning that golem in *defense* mode, since it has an ability that prevents it from being destroyed in battle. yuma: if i *wanted* advice from an annoying ghost, i'd go to a *haunted house*. i summon gogogo golem in attack mode.  yuma: how d'ya like *that*with eighteen hundred attack points, this golem won't be goin' down easy. mr. kay: i'm afraid this is what we call a *teachable moment*, yuma. yuma: huh. mr. kay: you've set me up for a *perfect victory*. act 4 <18:47> mr. kay: it's *over*, yuma. i overlay crashbug x, y, and zheheheheh. with these three monsters i build the overlay network.  <19:00> astral : here comes the number. yuma: ohh, an xyz summoning with *three* monsters.  mr. kay: that's right. prepare to meet your defeathere comes number thirtyfourterrorbyte..   kazwell: it appears to be some sort of data chip, capable of taking the form of a member of the rhinoceratidae family. but, what's the significance of the number.. yuma: i dunno, it, itah.  yuma: hahall right. both of my number cards are suddenly back in my deck.  yuma : weird. is it because astral came back. mr. kay: hahahaha. i'm activating terrorbyte's *special* ability. like a denominator absorbs a numerator in a perfect fractional ratio, by using one overlay unit, <20:00> i can take control of one of *your* monsters. your gogogo golem is *mine*.  yuma: ahh. *not cool*, mister kay.  mr. kay: and now, gogogo golem, attack yuma.. yuma: whaaaa. no. gagaga.   kari: sweet. i've broken through the viral program's firewall. now *where's the deactivation code*.  kari: so i've gotta make my way through this *dungeon maze*.... and the clock is still ticking.  mr. kay : you'll *never* defeat me, yuma. your dueling is too imperfect.  yuma: my dad used to say that imperfection is what makes us awesome. mr. kay: perfection is *everything*. i teach math because it is the pursuit of *absolute* perfection. the only reason your father said that <21:00> is so *you* wouldn't feel bad about being a failure. yuma: aw, man, mr. kay is *really layin' it out there*. kinda stings. astral: tell me *where* it stings. yuma : it stings in my heart. astral: observation number five. words can hurt a human's heart... i will *remember* that.  yuma: i can't let what he's saying get to me.... i gotta try to be strong. kazwell: um, yuma. yuma: huh.  kazwell: you know how i'm always saying 'in the end'. kazwell: well, it's interesting, becausethe phrase 'in the end' is *actually* about starting conditions. something that is so *in the end*, was that way from the beginning.  kazwell: it was inevitable. tori: sheesh... kazwell: and so it *actually*... yuma: i'm kinda *busy* at the moment, kazwellwhy're you bringin' this up *now*.. mr. kay: kazwell is simply trying to explain that, *in the end*, you're going to lose this duel, and i'm going to infect the entire city's control systemand that's been the case since the very beginning...  end <21:52> * special thanks to animeratio.com for the copy of this episode transcribed online. *
