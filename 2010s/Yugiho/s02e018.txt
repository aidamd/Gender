 act 1 <<2:26  nistro: you can't protect your monster anymore since you have no cards left in your hand. yuma: huh....  no cards in my handthat's right.  i activate my tasuke knight's special ability.  yuma: i almost forgotwhen tasuke knight is in my graveyard, and i get attacked with no cards in my hand, i can not only summon it, but it also ends the battle.    nistro: he *blocked me*.. tori: way to think on your feet, yuma. yuma: it's gonna take more than that to beat *me*. nistro: ugh... ya *got lucky*, kid. yuma: okay. let's see now... i have two levelfour monsters on my field.  i should summon utopia.  yuma: aahhh....  yo, astral.. where are you.. nistro: hey.. quit stallin', yuma. yuma : it's gonna be impossible to summon utopia without astral around.  astral: yuma. dark mist astral: seize astral, dark mist.  dark mist astral: give up. we will absorb you.  astral: yuma. quicklyutopia, you *must leave me* and go help yuma.  dark mist astral: *do not* let it escape..  astral: oh no..  yuma: ugh... i'll just have to win this *without* utopia. i*draw*.  yuma: ugghh.  this card can't put a stop to *any* of their monsters.  ugghh, tasuke knight, take out morpho butterspy. power push.  nistro: hah. that's the best you've got for us.. a *mosquito* could do more damage than you.   astral: utopia.. dark mist astral: dark mist, *destroy* number thirtynine.  dark mist astral: no.. it is getting away.  astral : good luck, yuma... nistro: *stop stalling*.. end your turn so i can crush ya. yuma: hhgghhh... nistro: either that or *forfeit the duel*.  yuma: okay. i'll place a card facedown and end my yuma: whoa.. my key.  yuma: utopia..... but since the card appeared, shouldn't astral be around, too.  astral, are you there.. astral.. where are you.. if utopia came without astral, then something must be *seriously wrong*.  dark mist astral: *utopia* got away, but *you* will pay the price.  dark mist astral: lacking utopia's protection, you will be helpless to resist us. your *concern for humans* must have weakened your mind.  dark mist astral: now, numbers, join with me. absorb astral so that we can complete our mission of destruction.  astral: what are you doing..  dark mist astral: all these numbers are under my control now. but i *need more power*. *you* will be assimilated next.. nistro: if the *light show is over*, kid, let's get back to dueling. dextra: there's something *weird* going on. be careful, nistro. flip: i hope yuma finds a way to flip this duel around... yuma: could it be... that astral's *also* battling, somewhere far from here. he must've made a *huge sacrifice* to send this to me. so i *can't waste this chance*. now let'sgo.. 'cause right now i'm feelin' the flow. first i'm gonna overlay my levelfour gagaga gardna and tasuke knight.  yuma: then i'll use them to build the overlay network. i xyz summon, number thirtynine, utopia.   yuma: all right.. nistro: it's*a number*.. *he has a number*.. and it's one of the most amazing i've ever seen.  dextra: it *is* spectacular....  yuma: okay, then. we're set to take 'em on, utopia.  yuma: there's no way they can defeat us now. nistro: i'm gonna *subtract* that number from 'is deck. dextra: *not yet*, nistro. nistro: huh. dextra : you have to wait for *me*. i'm summoning moonlit papillon.   nistro: don't, dextra. i told you, *i'm* goin' after that number. dextra: you'll wait your turn. now that we know he has a number card, this isn't a *game* anymore. we're doing this by the book. *understand*. nistro: unh..... ahhh, i hate *by the book*... dextra: i overlay my levelfour swallowtail butterspy and moonlit papillon.  dextra: and *with them*, i'll build the overlay network and then xyz summon photon papilloperative.   flip: that's one meanlooking butterfly. yuma: hey wait.  yuma : you're using photon monsters.  yuma: just like the ones kite used before.. act 2 <<8:13 yuma: how come you use photon monsters just like kite.. nistro: wha'd you say.. dextra: ...so. you know this 'kite' *well*, do you.  dark mist astral: there is no escape, astral. you *are* going to fulfill your missionwhether you like it or not. there is *much we have to destroy*...  yuma: i know kite. we dueled each other a while ago. but we finished in a draw. nistro: a draw.. but kite is one of the strongest duelists i know. you'd have to be *incredibly skilled*. dextra: either *that*... or... mister heartland told us, remember.  dextra : *he* said the original number, the envoy from astralworld, came to this planet.  dextra : well i think we just found it.  nistro: are you suggestin' that this kid's playin' host to the visitor from astralworld.. dextra: a twerp like him couldn't go toetotoe against kite unless he had a *major advantage*. nistro: i see what you're sayin'. if he *has* the original numberhahahah. it'll make *my* victory all the sweeter. dextra: *i'm* going hunting *first*, nistro.. yuma: rrghh.... dextra: and i'll use photon papilloperative's special ability.  dextra: by using one overlay unit, your utopia switches from defense mode to attack mode, and loses six hundred attack points.  dextra: then i'll *add* to your troubles by using my spell card "berserk scales". it gives my photon papilloperative a one thousand point attack boost.  yuma: that monster's *way* stronger than mine now. dextra: twelve hundred attack points to be exact, yuma. your number is safe but not your lifepoints. yuma: oh man. i don't have that many more to *lose*.  dextra: ready.. photon papilloperative, attack utopia with vivid swarm.  tori: no. yuma: i activate utopia's special ability. if i use an overlay unit, i can negate your attack. go, lightwinged shield.    yuma: i didn't take any damage. dextra: that's right. and unfortunately for *me*, due to berserk scales' effect, my monster photon papilloperative now loses two thousand attack points at the end of the turn. but at least we now know utopia's special ability. nistro. nistro: huh. dextra: i'll let you take over from here.  nistro: i'm fired up to win this thing. i *draw*.. i tribute my levelfour blade bounzer, to summon levelsix phantom bounzer.  yuma: i hope he's not gonna do what i *think*. nistro: *i am*. i overlay my levelsix phantom bounzer and hammer bounzer.  nistro: and just as you feared, i'll use them to build the overlay network. i xyz summon photon strike bounzer..   yuma: oh man. twenty seven hundred attack points. nistro: yeah. it's *really strong*. photon strike bounzer.. don't show any mercy.  nistro: go, strike streak. yuma: utopia. use your special ability. lightwinged shield.  nistro: ha. trickedcha.. yuma: tricked me.. nistro: photon strike bounzer has a special ability too. it can use an overlay to counteract your xyz monster's special ability.  nistro: and you get hit with one thousand points a' damage.. yuma: no way. if i take that big a hit, it's *over*.  act 3 <<12:00  astral : yuma....  astral: guh.  dark mist astral: there *is no escaping your fate*, astral. you will join with me and become me.  nistro: go.. photon strike bounzer. attack with strike streak.  yuma: i'm playing the trap, "damage diet". i only take half the damage from your special ability.  flip: ahh.... tori: yuma.... nistro: whatever. without your lightwinged shield, my monster can still attack. go on and strike it, strike bounzer.   flip: he can't survive another attack.  nistro: say 'sayonara' to the rest of your lifepoints. yuma: rgh... no chance. i'm activating the trap "half unbreak". this card can keep my utopia from being destroyed.  yuma: and i'll only take half the damage from your attackyaaaaaahhhh. ugh.  nistro: rrrgghhh... he's *still in this thing*.  nistro: but *just barely*. dextra: the kid is *finished*. his utopia is out of overlay units. plus he has *no more facedown cards*.  dextra: *stay down*. yuma: huh. dextra: take it easy on yourself, and *hand your number card over to us*. why put yourself through any more misery.  yuma: i won't *ever* give up.  yuma: now let's get on with the duel. nistro: *fine*if you wanna drag out this *farce*, *go ahead*.  yuma: it's my move. i *draw*. i'm summoning my cardcar d.   yuma: now i can *drive* this card away, and two new cards will race from my deck to replace it. floor it, cardcar. yeah.  yuma: to draw the card that i need, i've gotta *feel the flow*..  yuma : double or nothing, and double tension.  *they* won't help me....   yuma : no. i gotta think... there's *always a way*. i can still pull this off. i just have to figure out *how*. if only astral were here to help me. but he's *not*.  flip: ahh... tori: hey, what's wrong.  nistro: *finally*... i didn't think that twerp would *ever* give up.  astral: yuma.... dark mist astral: he failed *badly*. just as *you* failed, astral.    yuma : i'm *sorry*, astral... i couldn't do it.... flip: don't give up, yuma..  flip: come on, you *never* quit, remember.. tori: it's true.  tori : every time you're down or get your deck handed to you, you're so hotheaded and stubborn that you always get back up again and keep fighting.  tori: even when it seems hopeless'cause that's just *you*. yuma: tori's right... astral is depending on me.... i'll *keep* dueling, and i'm gonna win, too. because i'm *so feelin' the flow*.   astral: yuma. i sense you. we are connecting.  yuma: ahhh...  nistro: rrrgghhh. dextra: what is that kid *doing*..  dark mist astral: rrrrgghhh. uugghh. it feels like i am losing my hold on you. astral: that is due to the bond between yuma and me. we outpower you.  dark mist astral: *impossible*..  dark mist astral: ugh... rgh... rgh... aaaauugghhhh.   astral: yuma. yuma: huh. ohh....  yuma : it's about *time*. what's been keeping you.  astral: nice to see *you* as well.  nistro: huh. what is *that*.. act 4 <<17:03  nistro: what is *that*.. tori: astral's back. flip: just when we needed ya.  dextra: that must be the envoy who came here from astralworld. yuma : i suppose you came because you think i'm desperate for your *help*.  yuma: i don't need you making a *dramatic entrance* at the last minute to tell *me* what to do.  yuma: so you can go back to *goofin' off*, *wherever you came from*, and let me handle these guys. astral: so, this is a twoonone duel. you have done well, yuma. i sense all the pieces are in place for victory.  yuma: they are. really. astral : we can win this, *together*.  yuma: hah. yeah. astral: all right. first from your graveyard, activate overlay eater's special ability. yuma: you heard 'im, overlay eater. use your special ability now. flip: ah.  flip : that's the monster yuma sent to the graveyard so he could activate gagaga gardna's special ability. yuma : by banishing overlay eater...  yuma: i can snatch one of your xyz monster's overlay units and give it to utopia.  flip: and *now*, photon strike bounzer can't use its special ability. nistro: although that move *was clever*, it won't save you.. yuma and astral : utopia, attack photon papilloperative.  dextra: it's not enough damage to defeat *me*. yuma and astral : that's why i'm using utopia's special ability, and stopping its attack.  dextra: wait, did you just say *stop its attack*.. nistro: oh. yuma and astral : yes, and next i activate the spell "double or nothing." from my hand. since i stopped utopia's attack, this spell allows it to attack again, only this time utopia's attack points are *doubled*.  tori: they've *really* pumped up utopia. flip: but not by *enough*, tori. yuma and astral : don't worry about that. i activate the "double tension" spell card. it doubles the attack points of my monster when it's attacking for a *second* time.  dextra: i think we can start panicking now.. nistro: that's for sure.. astral: ready, yuma. yuma: yeah. yuma and astral : attack. go, rising sun supreme slash.  dextra: ah. ugh. nistro: i activate my trap. "bounzer guard". now i can redirect your attack, so it attacks photon strike bounzer.  yuma: ah....   tori: you did it. see. i told you not to give up. flip: wahaa. wow, for a minute there i thought we were *doomed*.  flip: but then astral showed up, to save the day..  yuma: oh, *please*...  dextra: why did you take that hit for me.. nistro: i dunno.  nistro: it just felt... right.  tori: ...well, if *this* doesn't prove that astral and you are a team, nothingnistro: yo, *kid*. yuma: huh. nistro: we're gonna give your friend here a second chance like we agreed. but i can promise you thisif flip cheats again, we're not gonna be as forgiving. and one more thing. next time we duel, i'm taking you and the original number *down*. yuma: huh.  nistro: heheheheh.  yuma: you're on. i'll duel ya any time, anywhere.  nistro: and now, we've gotta go the the jump on some more cheaters.  flip: i could've easily beaten those bullies by *myself*, of course, but it *all worked out anyway*. ahahahahahahaha.  there's that little fiend flip..  yuma and tori: huh.  we want our heart pieces. *now*.. flip: waaaaahhhh..  get back here.. flip: don't touch my hat  nistro: dextra, i think we should keep our runin with yuma a secret from mister heartland. dextra: but, *why*. nistro: 'cause i'm gonna defeat the original number. i don't want kite interfering.  dextra: you got it.  *take it easy*, flip. bye. see ya *never*. yeah. flip: well, i have *one* piece, anyway... huh....  flip: hey. it's gone..  flip: wahhahahah. i'm *heartbrokeeen*. end <<21:30 * special thanks to animeratio.com for the copy of this episode transcribed online. * special thanks to yugioh wikia as a source for checking cards. * special thanks to kazuki takahashi, 4kids, et al. for yugioh. zexal. last updated: february 8, 2013 i don't own yugioh zexal, at all, and this transcript is unofficial and without any permission whatsoever. please link back to me if you use my work. for more information about my transcript format, please click here. read my blog post on this episode here  )
