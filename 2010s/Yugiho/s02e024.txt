 vetrix: *too funny*.  so treyyou wanna meet with yuma tsukumo. trey: yes, i do. i have questions. *he* was the reason we lost our last duel. yuma's power was too strong to overcome.  trey : i wanna know *how* he learned to duel with such intensity. what's the source of his power.  trey: *i won't rest* until i discover the truth for myself.  vetrix: all right, trey.  trey: i can *go*. vetrix: since you find yuma so *intriguing*, i *encourage* it.   act 1 <<1:58  yuma: aaah, come on. gotta be *someone* around here who's willing to duel me. how 'bout *you*, sir. huh.  old man: nope. yuma: you *won't*.. fine then.  yuma: hey, kidwanna duel.  yuma: ohh. ah.  yuma: how 'bout *you*. *please* duel me.  yuma: noi meant with *cards*. daaaahhh.  tori: *will you get a grip*. you're embarrassing me. yuma: i'm in big trouble, tori. if i don't win my last heart piece, i'm outta the tournament. it's the last day a' the preliminaries. i need an opponentand quiiiiiick..  tori: wait for *me*, at least.  tori: wait up. wait.  yuma: i can't. the clock is ticking..  astral: at pace, yuma. you'll find the duelist that you are *meant* to battle with. yuma: you sound like a *fortune cookie*.  yuma: heyare you okay. buddy. *tell me what happened to you*. i... was... dueling shark...  yuma: whoa...  tori: it looks like a *tornado* hit this place. yuma: *shark* did this.  stop. that's enough.. i give up... *i give up*...   yuma: shark.... whoa. shark... why did you *do* this.  yuma: hold onaren't you even gonna *try* to explain. shark: explain *what*. there's a tournament going on and i'm dueling in it. yuma: come on. you know what i mean. shark: some duelists like to *talk* trash, but i've decided to start trashing my opponents *directly*.  yuma: shark, *listen to me*. shark: if you try to interfere, i'll make sure you *regret it*.  *stay outta my way*.  yuma: you *can't leave*, shark. shark: why not. yuma: 'cause i won't *let* you.  shark: think you can *stop me*, yuma. yuma: yeah, i'm challenging you, shark. we are gonna duel.  shark: right here and now. yuma: that's right, you heard me. i won't take no for an answer.  shark: you're on, theni'd *never* turn down the chance to make this the *worst day of your life*. yuma: great. we're *set*.  astral: yumait is unwise to duel while angry. yuma: you save it. i know what i'm doing.   yuma: hah. duel disk, go. this duel's gonna be *epic*.  shark: an epic *fail* for *you*.  yuma: duel gazerlet's roll.  computer: augmented reality vision link established.  yuma and shark: let's duel.  trey: yuma's dueling against shark.  trey : the last time shark dueled, a number fragment entered his body, filling him with hate.  trey: perfect. i can learn a *lot* from watching this duel. yumasoon all of your dueling secrets, will be revealed. act 2 <<5:43  shark: now. big jawspolish off gagaga magician. gulp grind attack.  yuma: uugghhh... gagaga, no. shark: next i'm comin' at you *directly*. hammer sharkattack. yuma: i play, the trap card "small resistance". since gagaga girl was in my graveyard, hammer shark *loses* attack points equal to *her* attack points.  yuma: rrrgghh, that was *nothing*. can'tcha do any *better*.. shark: no problem. i'll just have to stop takin' it *easy* on ya. but *first* i'll need a *bigger fish*. i overlay my levelthree hammer shark and big jaws.  shark: with these two monsters i build the overlay network and xyz summonsubmersible carrier aero shark.  shark: i activate aero shark's special ability, so now you're gonna get hit with four hundred points a' damage for every card in my hand. and i've got *three of 'em*. torpedo takedown.  tori: ah... yuma. shark: ready to call it *quits*. it's only gonna get *worse*. huh.  yuma: is that all ya got.  yuma: *honestly*i think you're losin' your edge.  *try harder next time*..  shark: *you* go. yuma: good, then watch me carefully. maybe you'll *learn* something.  huah. i summon gogogo giant in attack mode.   yuma: i end my turn, you're up, shark. shark: what's that..  tori: why, yuma.. astral : is this wise. if you attack with your giant *now*, it can destroy shark's monster.  astral: do you have some *other plan* in mind.  yuma: not really. i'm just *goin' with the flow*. shark: all right, then*i'll* go.  trey: what is yuma *up* to. it's like our *last* duel...  trey : he was unpredictable and never gave up. yuma wasn't just dueling to win a single victory, and he wasn't trying to get even with his enemies, either.   trey: yuma...*what is it that motivates you*.  quentin: are you sure it was a good idea to let trey go. i am worried, vetrix. yuma's powers are far greater than you may realize. what if trey falls under his influence and *doesn't come back*. vetrix: don't be concerned. your brother is going to return. quentin: and you're *sure* of that. vetrix: yes... trey is too trusting and loyal to ever leave us.  vetrix : that's just the way he is.  shark: i summon out, black ray lancer.    astral: this is serious. yuma: rrrgghh. shark: lancer. take down that giant. go, shimmering spear slash.  yuma: i'm sorry, gogogo giant. shark: submersible carrier aero shark, attack yuma directly with devouring dive.  tori: are you okay..  astral: why are you dueling so recklessly, yuma. yuma: i'm... still in this... ya haven't broken me *yet*, shark.. come onif ya want me to end up like those *other* duelists you pushed around, you'll have to *try harder*.  astral: careful. you are *losing this duel*. yuma: i don't *care*. astral: huh. yuma: it doesn't matter if i win or losei'm gonna *let shark beat me* if that's what it takes.  astral: wait, *yuma*...  yuma: heylisten. if i'm your *enemy*, then why don't you use all that anger building up inside you against *me*.  yuma: strike at me as hard as ya can. yuma: if that's what it's gonna take to get rid of all your anger, *do it*. shark: agh. be quiet. yuma: tell meare you *proud of yourself* for dueling this way.. well *are* ya, shark..  yuma: you used to love dueling. but if you keep this up you're gonna grow to *hate it*, and you'll hate *yourself*, too.  yuma: you're my *friend*, shark. and i don't wanna see you destroy yourself with hate. i won't *let you*..  tori: uh... yuma.  yuma: oopsheheheheheh... tori: nice job*that* sure spoiled the mood... yuma: rgh, *i* can't help it if my food tank's runnin' on empty. astral : i must say, your sense of timing is as bad as your *dueling*. yuma: gimme a break. how can *i* control my stomach.. it's got a mind of its own.  tori: you didn't even say 'excuse me'. yuma: *excuuuse* me. there, happy now.  tori: ugh... trey : *wait*... trey: shark's heart freed itself by getting rid of the anger from that number.  tori: true champions don't take *snack breaks*. yuma: rrrggghhh... shark: that's it. tori: huh.  shark: i'm outta here. see ya, yuma. yuma: you're quitting. but why.. ya *can't*. shark: i guess you could say... i lost my *appetite* for crushing you. heh. yuma: ha, ha. you can't chicken out. shark: you can get your revenge in the *finals*.  tori: wipe off that goofy *grin*, yuma. yuma: what've i done wrong *now*.. tori: it's what you *didn't* do. you didn't get to the *finals yet*, or have you *forgotten* that. yuma: oh... yaaaahhhh.. i forgot, i still need to win one more heart piece by the end of *today*.. astral: in your urge to help your friend, you also forgot about *another* fact. had you lost to shark, i would've faded from existence along with all the numbers that we have gathered.  yuma: ssorry. guess i was feelin' *too* much flow, and i blanked about the tournament and the numbers. tori: don't forget what you promised your father. you swore you'd become a *champion duelist* someday. yuma: yeahand i'm gonna *keep* that promise. but i *still* think i did the right thing. i bet *dad* would've risked losing to help shark. so he prob'ly woulda been *proud* a' what i did.  trey: maybe yuma's *father* is the key. act 3 <<12:56  trey: this must be yuma's mother and father.    trey: huh.  trey: that's *amazing*. ah.... grandma: who're *you*.. trey: ahh.  trey: uhhh, i'm a friend of yuma's.  yuma: will someone *please* duel me. help me out here.  yuma: i mean, come yuma: huh. who's *calling* me.  yuma: hey, grandma. what's goin' on. grandma: your friend is here.  yuma: hey. whadda you think you're doing.. huh. yaah.  yuma: waaaaaahhhhh. trey : yuma. it is fate.  trey: fate that brought me here to your house today. otherwise i wouldn't've seen all these *awesome artifacts*. you have aztec masks, paleolithic tools, and*no way*. a royal incan necklace. sorry for geeking out, but this collection is *incredible*. it's just like the stuff in my favorite cards.  trey: look.  yuma: isn't that an *aztec mask golem*. trey: yeah. cool, huh. this was one of the first cards i collected for my chronomaly deck. chronomalies are mysterious artifacts, that could link this world to *other dimensions*. this world is part of a multidimensional matrix. and chronomalies may've come here *from* another dimension. my father was a researcher and taught me about it. yuma: whoa. *my* dad was into that kinda stuff, too. he'd go on expeditions and always bring things back. trey: wow, that's cool. it sounds like he was somebody who loved adventure. yuma: hehehyep. just like me.  yuma: ugh. we have *way more important* things to discuss. like what you guys did to *hart*.  trey: i know. yuma: huh. trey: i feel truly sorry for what happened to him. yuma: really.  trey: i did, but, i had to... i guess... i figured the best way to duel... was to tap into the anger in my heart. but then, i saw how *you* duel, and i realized there might be a better way. yuma: huh. trey: what's your secret. i've seen how unselfish you can be when you're dueling. is that the source of the power you have. yuma: whaddaya mean, power. trey: the way you duel... is unlike anything i've seen. like you're dueling with *all your heart* and nothing can stop you. yuma: i duel that way because... because uh... it's the only way i *know* how to duel. trey: huh. yuma: i just always try, to *highfive the sky*. trey: highfive the sky. yuma: right. when i was small, my father told me to never give up or stop trying. feel the flow and *go for it*.  trey: that's *awesome advice*.  kari: hey yuma, lunch is ready. come on. and you're *all* welcome to join us.  yuma: oh yeah. duel fuel. let's *dig in*. grandma: yuma.  grandma: not so fast. wait for everyone to sit. yuma: uh... sorry, grandma. grandma : good boy.  kari: *please*, yuma. try to eat like a *human* today. yuma : i'll try. tori: wow. that looks *delish*.  kari: there's *plenty*. have a seat. trey: uh... thank you.  yuma : not bad, but kinda small though.  lillybot: tea is ready. tea is ready. be careful. tea is hot.  lillybot: *sip it slowly*, this time, yuma. yuma: hey, i *know* how to drink tea. lillybot: no you don't. no you don't.  yuma: aaaaaaaaaaaahhhh. why didn't you *warn* me it was hot.. lillybot: yuma stinks at drinking tea.  yuma: i don't see what's so *funny*, trey. kari : you're right, yuma. the way you eat isn't *funny*it's *disgusting*. yuma: i can't help it if i'm in a rush.  yuma: it's an emergency.  yuma: honest. i gotta duel.  kari: no cards at the kitchen table. got it. yuma: i was just *showin'* ya. give 'em back, sis. you don't want me to get eliminated from the *tournament*, do ya.  kari: you'll get 'em back, *when we're all done*. yuma: that could take *forever*. can'tcha see i'm in a hurry.   fb young trey: oh quatro. i almost forgot to show you.  fb young trey: it's an aztec mask golem. father gave it to me today. fb quatro: how come *i* didn't get one *too*.. i *want it*..  fb young trey: hey. give it back to me. that's *my* card.  fb young quatro: oh, *yeah*.. fb young trey: ugh. come on. lemme have it back.  fb young quatro: ya gotta *take* it from me. hahahahahaha.  fb young trey: get your *own* mask golfb young quentin: all right, that's *enough*, you two. father should be home *any minute*, so you'd better behave. fb young quatro: ergh. he *started* it. fb young trey: *me*..  fb young trey: can i *please* have it back. fb young quatro: okay.  fb young quentin: you guys be on your best behavior, and i'll teach you how to *duel* later.  fb young quatro: that a *promise*. fb young quentin: sure. fb young trey: thanks, quentin.   yuma: *just watch me*. i'll be the tournament champion. tori: you haven't even *advanced* yet. you're *one win short* still.  trey : *my* family used to be like this... but that was *so long ago*.  yuma: what's wrong. grandma: not feeling well.  yuma: ...are you okay.  trey: please excuse mebut i have to leave.  yuma: trey, hold up.  trey : sorry, yumabut i know what i have to do now. act 4 <<19:10  yuma: trey, what's goin' on.  trey: after spending time with you, i think i understand now, yuma. it's your *family*... *they* give you power. it's not the same with me. my family is different than yours. it wasn't *always* that way. we used to be as happy as your family is.  trey : the day we swore we'd get revenge on our enemies, everything changed. it was like we became *different people*.  trey: maybe... once we *do* get our revenge... we'll go back to the way we *were*.  trey: *you're in our way*. we can't get vengeance because you *keep* getting in our way. i *will* find a way to defeat you. for the sake of my family, i must. yuma: you're wrong, trey. revenge isn't the answer. it'll just *destroy* you. trey: i have to be loyal to my family. yuma: but treytrey: i'll do whatever i have to, yuma. yuma: oh, *yeah*. trey: you'll see.  trey: here. we'll settle this tonight, once and for all.  astral: he wants to meet you at *these* coordinates. yuma: i guess. trey: we're gonna have a duel, yuma.  trey: and *you will lose*. yuma: treydon't go.   quentin: you're *back*.  vetrix: welcome home, trey. was your trip a success. trey: yes. i guess. vetrix: you don't have to tell *me* a thing. i already understand. you're hungry for powerthe power that can help you crush yuma tsukumo. trey: yes.  astral: yuma... i do not trust that boy. i advise you not to meet with trey. yuma: i *have* to go, to talk to him. trey's better than he pretends. there's a chance i can *help* him. i have to try.  yuma: i *will* meet trey. tonight we're gonna duel. end
