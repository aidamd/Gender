tombo: pepper pounder.. aaaaaaaahhhh...  tombo: carrot crunch..  tombo: extreme eggplant.  tombo: cuclobber.   nistro: looks like *someone* had a runin with a produce stand.  better call it in.  dextra: we found another downed duelist. send a unit here right away to help him out.  nistro: whoever did *this* is playing by their own rules. check *this* out.  dextra: ah, just as i thought.  that stain is *tomato juice*.  nistro: what kinda crazy duel *was* this, kid..   act 1 <<1:52  yuma: i plan to do a lot of dueling today, so i've gotta fill up on some *duel fuel*.  tori: *yuma*, please try to eat like a human being.  yuma: sorry, but i'm hungry as an elephant. tori: ohh...  yuma: no way. stop. you. come back, you snacknapper. that's mine.  yuma: ohhh... um. i can't duel on an empty stomach.  tombo: you look like you need some energizin', my friend. yuma : huh.  tombo: here, chow down on some cucumbers. they are deelicious.  yuma: i *love these*.  i wonder if they come in any other flavors.  tori: mm... hey, you're right. they're *great*. so did you grow all these vegetables yourself.  tombo: yes, ma'am.  yuma: wow. i'm not hungry anymore. *and* i'm ready to duel. thanks.  yuma: duhuh... *what's* your name.  tombo: well, sir, i'm tombo tillbiddyand i love tomatoes, more than practically *anything*. my dream is to build a huge entertainment park dedicated to tomatoes, right here in the big city. yuma: a *tomato amusement park*.  tombo : yes siree. 'cause tomatoes are the finest and funnest vegetables on this whole planet.  tombo : i wanna win the duel carnival so i'll be set on the road to fame an' fortune and i can make tomatotopia a reality.  tombo: 'course, i'll need a greeter to meet the guests when they enter the park... and... i think... tori: huh. tombo: that you would make the absolute perfect person for the job, ma'am. tori: huh..  tori: hi.. welcome to tomatotopia.   yuma: that's not gonna happen. tori: huh. yuma : there won't be a tomatotopia.. tori: uh, *yuma*... yuma: tombo, thanks for givin' me that *cucumber*, but you're not gonna win the duel carnival 'cause *i'm* a better duelist. tombo: oh, *really*. prove it. yuma: i plan to. let's duel.  tombo: that suits me fine. i've already won a whole crop a' victories to make my dream come trueand you'll be the next loser. bring it on, son. yuma: i *will*. duel disk, go.  yuma and tombo: let's do this.  tombo: but before we start, i'd like to propose we add a special rule, just for fun. yuma: hold up, what special rule. tombo: the *basket rule*.  tombo: before you attack you gotta pull a vegetable outta the basket and gobble it down. yuma: hm.  tombo: you can't start your attack until it's *all eaten up*. you fired up for the challenge, son.. yuma: dah. but it's not fair. you can't just make up some *crazy rule* and expect me to go along with it. nistro: sounds like you're *chicken*.  nistro: listen, kid. i'm a member of the committee that approves all of the duel carnival regulations.  nistro: *this* yokel's already caused all *kinds* a' chaos with his *special veggie rules*, and that's okay by me. haha.  dextra: hold on, nistro*i* have to approve, too. nistro: aww, loosen up, dextra. our farmer friend here just wants to make things interesting, for his cityslicker rivals.  tombo: i'm glad you understand. yuma: wait. his rules are bogus. he's gonna have a *huge advantage*. the dude's a, a *vegetable fanatic*. nistro: so what's wrong with that. betcha *this* kid's a major *junk food* fanatic. yuma: huh. dextra: they say you *are what you eat*. yuma: i eat healthy food sometimes.  dextra: then you shouldn't have a *problem*, should you. i *also* approve the basket rule.  yuma: but *lady*. nistro: bon apptit.  yuma: hey, wait a secondtombo: since i'm a visitor to these parts, why don'tcha let *me* go first. an' nowi draw. first up i use the field spell tomata' paradise.  tombo: this lets me muster a tomato token whenever i summon a planttype monster, and tomato paradise is *beautiful* to boot. yuma: it looks like a tomato nightmare. tombo: next up, i summon tomatoknight.   tombo: my tomata' knight's a *planttype monster*, so i can summon a tomato token, too.   yuma: yggh. what is *up* with this guy. why don't you summon something *original*, like, uh, broccoli. tombo: ta' give a little *zing*, i'm activatin' the spell "tomatopult".  tombo: not only does it let me hurl a plant monster and hit 'cha for *four hun'r'd points a' damage*, but it's *mighty entertainin' too*. ready 'r not, here comes a tomato token.  act 2 <<6:32  tombo: get ready to get splattered.  tombo: hahahahahahahaha. you're gonna need a good *scrubdown* after *this* duel is done. now *you're* up.  yuma: ihbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr. that does it, tombo. i'll smash your tomatoes into *pulp*. tori: don't hold back, yuma. yuma: i won't. i draw. and summonmy achacha archer.  astral: it will deal five hundred points of damage, and that should most likely get this duel back on track. yuma: yeah. let it *fly*, achacha. tombo: awaaahhhh.  astral: perfect. now you should attack a monster. target his tomatoknight. yuma: right.  i forgot, i can't attack.  yuma: according to the rules i have to pull a vegetable out of this basket first and then *eat* it. tombo: so *do it*, yuma. yuma: i was *about to*.  yuma: just be careful, whatcha pick... ahh... *this* seems okay. feels like a vegetable i *know*. kind of like... an *eggplant*.  yuma: yaahwhat *is* this thing.. tombo: it's a hybrid i grew crossin' an eggplant and a tomato. it's tasty to a tee. i call it an *eggmato*.  yuma: ugghhh... no way. i'll put a card facedown and call it quits for this turn. tori: yuma, this is no time to get *picky*. astral: it makes no sense to avoid attacking. tombo: ya should've struck while ya had a chance.  *you'll regret not eating your vegetables, my fussy little friend..* yuma: ggghhh.... tombo: my turn todraw. feast your eyes on tomato in tomato.  tombo: this card's *doubly* dangerous. that's 'cause, its ability lets me summon *another* one straight to my field. and when you figure in the effect of tomato paradise, i can add to my own tomato team by summonin' up *two tomato tokens*.  yuma: ahh. how many *tomato* cards have you *got*.. tombo: heh, i got *bushels* full of 'em. an' here's one a' my *faves*the "tough tomato" spell card. now my planttype monster gains five hundred attack points until the end a' the turn.  tombo: an' that gives 'em *plenty more juice*. i've turned these *cuddly little critters* into the *ultimate power plants*. but before i attack i gotta eat a veggienow which one will it be.  tombo: a zesty pepper.  tombo: i'm pepped up.  astral: prepare yourself, yuma. tombo: tomatoknight, go after achacha archer with bullseye blast.  tombo: now tomato in tomato is takin' aim *directly at you*. brace yourself. go, tomato torrent.  yuma: aaaaahhh.... tombo: hooee. i could keep peltin' ya with tomato monsters 'til yer knocked out. tori: no.. fight back, yuma. astral: now. use a trap card.  yuma: oh, yeah. i'll use the "heartfelt appeal" trap to turn the tables on 'im. tombo: ugh... yuma: now when you hit me with a direct attack, i can control whichever one of your monsters has the most defense points, which means your tomato in tomato is now working as a bodyguard for *me*.  tombo: nice. it's been quite a while since i saw the old 'tomato shield' ploy. but i got some tomato tricks a' my own. don't forget my tomatopult is still in effect, and that monster ya took won't save ya.  tombo: go get 'im guys.  yuma: aaaaahhhhh. tombo: that's what i call tomato teamwork.  tombo: you're up, yuma. yuma: ugh... i can't take any more... astral: *try* to feel the flow...  yuma: all right, now *i* draw. i tribute tomato in tomato, and summon chachaka archer.   astral: quite a wise choice. no doubt you chose it because it can destroy a spell or trap card once per turn. yuma: it *can*. chachaka, use your special ability to trash that tomatopult.  yuma: now to power up. ha. this card should do the trickmy "blustering winds" spell will give chachaka archer another one thousand attack points. astral: very good work. and now you can attack.  yuma: that's right. i, uhh...  yuma: completely forgot about *dumb basket rule..* yyaauugghhh...  yuma: take your time... this one feels, uh, *familiar*... like a... cucumber.  astral: look at that. i see that it is the same color as a tomato. yuma: ahh. how can *that* be.. tombo: ha hahahahahaha. that there's the tastiest tomato creation i ever grew. have a bite and i guarantee you'll agree, yuma. yuma: yggghh, *quit playin' games with me*.. tombo: take it easy. see. i'm just expandin' the world of tomatoes to show how great they are.  yuma: *i* think... that you're actually trying to force me into *forfeiting our duel*.. mmmgghh...  astral: what is wrong. tori: pull yourself together, yuma. that basket has turned you into a basket *case*.  yuma: gggghh, noooooooo.  yuma: i won't do it, sorry. astral: you *won't*. tombo: wait a minute. you don't like tomatoes, *do ya*. yuma : that's right, it's true.. i think that tomatoes are *disgusting*...  act 3 <<12:16 tori: you hate tomatoes, yuma. yuma: i admit it. i've hated them since i was a baby. *they're horrible*. astral: you would rather lose, than eat one of them. tori: yuma, you've got to eat one of those vegetables.. yuma : *you can't make me*. right now, i'll put a card down, and end my turn. tombo : so you're a *tomatohater*, huh.. when you 'n' me started this, it was just a duelbut now it's a grudge match... yuma: ahh. uhoh. tombo: i won't let you *insult* the greatest vegetable on earth.. it's odious ignoramuses like yourself who stand in the way of my buildin' tomatotopia... yuma: rrrgh, fyi, tomatoes are technically *fruit*, so they'll *never* be the greatest vegetable on earth.. tombo: that's iti'm gonna serve you up a *heap a' hurtin' with a side a' grief*. here it comes.  yaahh. i summon tomato in tomato.  tombo: and tomato *token*, too. yuma: uhoh. astral: i sense he is up to something big. tombo: i'm overlayin' both my tomato in tomatoes, plus my tomatoknight. then i use them to build the overlay network, so i can xyz summon. make way for the king a' the crop, the toughest tomato of 'em all, all hail the mighty tomato king.   yuma: yaaahhh.... tori: that looks *tasty*. tombo: then i'll take advantage of tomato paradise's effect to summon a tomato token. and what's more, i'll activate tomato king's special ability. by usin' an overlay unit, this monster's attack points double until my next turn. *nothin'* can stop this tomata' now.  yuma: uuuggghhh. oh man, imagine running into *that* freak in a grocery store. look at those attack pointsthirtytwo hundred.  tombo: okay, get set, king. fix yer aim on chachaka archer. pour on the heat with tomato terror.  yuma: ahhh. tori: yuma. tombo: that's the way. you finished yuma off. wha.  yuma: heheheheheheheh. tombo: how come you still have lifepoints left.. yuma: when you attacked, i activated my "transaction summon" trap card. this card lowers the damage i take by five hundred, and then i can summon a monster with one thousand or fewer attack points. tombo: rrrgghh... yuma: so not only did your king's attack get totally *squashed*, but now i can also bring out a supersweet monsterlike *this*. say hello to gagaga girl.  yuma: thing *is*, i can't destroy your monster in battle for a couple of your turns. it's the price i have to pay for using the trap.  tombo: heeheeheehee, allrighty. since you only *have* four 'un'r'd lifepoints, i can afford to wait another turn before my tomatoes take you down. go for it. yuma: rrrgghh. okay, tombo, i'll draw.  come on out, gagaga magician.  astral: i suggest you change the card's level, yuma. yuma: yeah. i change gagaga magician to level three. astral: next step up is the key to your victory. yuma: huh. astral: if you choose to xyz summon now, you will have a fighting chance to win this duel. but first you have to reach into that basket and eat what you pull out. yuma: uhh, i dunno, astral. what if i pull out another *tomato*.  yuma: ugh, i'll have to focus on all of my powers for this move.  act 4 <<15:59 tombo: *you're up*, yuma. astral: the next step holds the key to your victory. yuma: huh. astral: if you choose to xyz summon now, you will have a fighting chance to win this duel. but first you have to reach into that basket and eat what you pull out. yuma: i dunno, astral. what if i pull out another *tomato*. hmph. i'll have to focus on all of my power for this move. rrrgghh.  yuma : hmm, here's a vegetable i'm *sure* about.  yuma: hello*carrot*.  tombo: hehehehehhehahaha.. that's a carrotlike tomato i dreamt up which i call *tomarrot.* yuma: yaaahhh. ohh noooooo.  tori: don't be a wimp. *eat that tomarrot*. astral: you have no choice. that is, unless you wish to lose. yuma: i know that..  but tomatoes are yucky and i won't eat 'em, i won't, i won't, i won't. tori: okaytombo will win, and *then* d'you know what will happen. he's gonna turn this whole city into *tomatotopia*.  yuma: igh. tori: imagine what meals will be like around here after *that* happens.  tori : tomato salad for lunch...  tori : tomato pizza for dinner. and tomato *duel fuel* for dessert.  tori : and *i'll* force you to swallow *every bite*.  yuma: what.. astral: she *sounds serious*, yuma. yuma: rrgghhh.... astral: all right. yuma: you guys win, are you happy now.. i'll try eating the tomarrot.  yuma: ready or not, taste buds, here i go..  yuma: ...hey. hey, i *really like it*.  tombo: hahahahahaha. tori: ohh, yeah.  yuma: it's even better than chocolatecovered pork rinds. tombo : that's music to my ears, you make me so proud. i'm happy as a crow in a cornfield.. yuma: yeah.. astral: this is your chance, yuma. quicklyxyz summon now. yuma: gotcha. i overlay my levelthree gagaga magician and gagaga girl, in order to build the overlay network. i xyz summon melomelody the brass djinn.   astral: whenever you use gagaga girl and another gagaga monster to xyz summon, then the attack points of your opponent's xyz monster can be zeroed out.  yuma: go, cell phone subtraction.  tombo: he's not the top tomato anymore. yuma: watch out, 'cause melomelody the brass djinn's gettin' ready to play. hit it, melomelody the brass djinn. blast tomato king with melody wave.  yuma: as of right now, tomato king won't be destroyed because of transaction summon's effect. but you'll still take some *heavyduty damage*. tombo: rgh. aaaaaaaaahhh....  astral: and now you can activate melomelody the brass djinn's special ability. yuma: cool. i almost forgot that if you have an xyz monster on your field, melomelody can use an overlay unit and attack again.  yuma: tombo*your tomatoes are fantastic*.  yuma: i wanna dedicate these last attacks to them. here's to you, tomato king.  yuma: that was *awesome*, melomelody, and now you can go for an *encore*.  yuma: ready. go ahead and attack it. melody wave.  tombo: oh, now i know what it feels like to be a tomato when it's just been *canned*.  yuma: yes. haha.  yuma: tombo. are you okay, buddy. wake up. tombo: yuma.  tombo: thanks.  yuma: sorry, tombo. i know how much winning this duel meant to you. but at least you *did* win over my stomach.  just thinkif we hadn't dueled, i never woulda realized how amazing tomatoes are. tombo : that's all that matters. you an' me may be opponents on the duelin' field, but from now on we'll always be brothers on the *tomato* field.  yuma: that's right.  tombo: so long. i'm gonna miss ya, buddy.  tombo: here's your heart piece.  tombo: huhuhaha. take it easy. yuma: huh.  yuma: that was the weirdest duel i ever fought, *and* the most tasty. tori: it's true. astral: observation number sixteen. the human stomach is as complicated as the human brain... yuma: oh yeah.. i'm gettin' to the finals even if i have to *eat* my way there.. end <<20:56 * special
