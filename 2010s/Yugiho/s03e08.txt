off.  tori : i guess you're stuck with me. yuma: i'm glad you're taggin' along, tori. you'll be there in person when i win it all.  astral: correction when *we* win it all. act 3 <<12:55  mr. heartland: the duel carnival finals have begun with a huge surprise. yuma tsukumo's coaster got left in the dust, but now he's back in action and he has a *copilot*.   mr. heartland : that may be stretching the *rules* a bit, but since *i'm* running this competition, i'm gonna make an exceptionand allow yuma's friend to tag along.  yuma: we're pickin' up a lotta speedand i'm feelin' the flow. tori: i think you should *slow it down* a bit. yuma: why would i do that. i've already fallen *behind* the other finalists. i have to catch up with 'em. ...but, when i do, i'm not sure how the rules work. i have no idea when i can *challenge* an opponent or where we're supposed to *have* our duel. astral: yuma, look up ahead.  astral: there is a duel in progress. astral : and the opponents are battling while in the *same lane*.  nistro: what's the deal with this clown. i better teach 'im a lesson for trying to take me down.  i *draw*. i summon heroic challenger spartan.     nistro: sothis guy thinks he can take me down with battlestorm. well that's *not gonna happen*. i play the spell card "riryoku".  nistro: with this, i can take away half of battlestorm's attack points, and then give them to my spartan. hahahahaha.  nistro: now, my spartan. attack.. strike javelin.  cowboy duelist: that's no way to treat the law.    cowboy duelist: get me down from here. tori : *that* was scary.  astral : it would appear the price of losing in these finals is rather extreme. yuma: yeah.  nistro: these finals just got startedand i already downed my first duelist. astral: i see... you can challenge an opponent to a duel if you share the same track. yuma: rightand if i spot a duelist on a *different* track... then i'll change tracks and take 'em on.     shark: jawsman. attack. shark stream.  russian duelist: do svidaniya. waahh.   bronk: whoa. shark isn't messin' *around*. cathy: i wonder what's keeping yuma.   quatro: ha. so *shark's on the hunt*, huh. well *so am i*..  shark : i'll *crush you*, quatro.. you're not gonna escape from *me*not without a *fight*. quatro: i've got other fish to fry before *you*, shark. it's time to *mix it up* with gimmick puppet egg head..  quatro: attack 'im directly. go..  italian duelist: mamma mia.  quatro: ha ha ha ha. too bad he had a 'chute.  quinton: my brother... always eager to strike first. at this rate, he'll be taking a *parachute ride* just like all the *other* losers today. instead of attacking, he should take time to *learn* some things, that might save his skin down the road.  german duelist: achtung. i will duel you.. pulverize that guy, vylon disigma.  german duelist: attack him directly... huh. hah.  quinton: challenging me was a mistake, and it's going to burn you in the end. nowi activate the trap card "infernal sun". i can use it when a monster that has two thousand or more attack points strikes at me directly. this trap deals you eight hundred points of damage for *every card in your hand*.  german duelist: huh. oh, nein.  german duelist: muttiiiiiiii...  quinton: just as i thought. there *is* a spell marker here. the card that was facedown is "dian keto the cure master".  quinton: its effect will make me stronger, increasing my lifepoints by one thousand.   vetrix: very *clever*, quinton. quatro and shark are eager to win right away. but quinton uses his brains, *just like me*.  vetrix : and now it's time to see how clever yuma tsukumo is. yuma: this is a dueltopia. haha. we gotta get in on the action, tori.  astral: i predict you will soon see *plenty* of action. right over there...  yuma: huh. why'd they let me pass by.  wolfsbane: it was thoughtful of him to leave late. we didn't have to lure him away from the other duelists before we pounce.  jackal: demolishing that *kid* should be a piece a' cake. coyote: and the cash we get will be the icing.  vetrix: it's *perfect*. those mercenaries won't let up on yuma. he'll be *pushed to the limit*, and then i'll be able to find out how good he *really* is. wolfsbane: okay. it's time to make our move. fang formation. coyote and jackal: let's go..  tori: huh. they're moving up.  yuma: what're they up to..  astral: they are staging a joint attack. it appears you have been ambushed. yuma: uuuuuuhh. astral: they have sandwiched your car so you cannot escape to another lane.  yuma: 'ey. these aren't bumper cars. i won't play *your* game.  wolfsbane: hahahahahaha. act 4 <<19:32  tori: aaah. aaah. aaaaahhhh.  astral: what is that 't' mark up ahead.  yuma: it's a trap card....  astral: that was the trap "secret barrel". for each card in your hand *and* on your field, you take two hundred points of damage. yuma: uwaaahhh. thanks for tellin' me somethin' i already *know*. this is just *wonderful*... i have to duel *three lowlifes* and avoid trippin' traps.  jackal: he blundered right into that trap, and now he's weaker. coyote: i wonder how this *clown* made it into the finals in the first place. wolfsbane: it should be a cinch to take care of business quickly and get the money we were promised.  yuma: ahh. wolfsbane : you can't run, kid. we're *all* going to duel you. yuma: at *once*.. wolfsbane: form up. assault formation. coyote and jackal: let's go.  tori: aahh.... yuma: three on one.. wolfsbane: yes, you'll face a whole *trio* of monsters led by magnet eagle delta. jackal: an' my magnet saucer will be his wingman. coyote: with *another* magnet saucer to *complete* the threesome.     yuma: we've got a whole air force against us. tori: and we're sitting ducks down here. astral: you are badly outnumbered, yuma. you *must fight wisely*. or elseyour first battle in the world duel carnival finals will be your last.  vetrix: hahahahahahahaha. this should be entertaining. now we'll seeif yuma has what it takes to beat a *triple* threat.  vetrix: ahhahahahahahahaha.. end <<21:25 * special thanks to animeratio.com for the copy of this episode transcribed online. * special thanks to yugioh
