 yuma: ugh, i'm gettin' sick of these traps... tori: *pull yourself together*, yuma... astral: up aheadthere is *another* trap. yuma and tori: uh. aaaauughh.  tori: turn left, please turn left..  yuma: whoaa.  tori: that was too close.. *yuma*. you *need to stay more alert*.. we almost got.  tori: yuma....  yuma : dextra...  yuma : kite...  yuma : quatro...  yuma : quinton...  yuma : and shark.   yuma: it's *too much*. tori: hang on..  yuma: look. tori: *can't* look. too bright. astral: this must be the *desert* field.  nistro: bout *time* you showed up.  yuma: nistro.... what're *you* doing here. nistro: well. seems it's down to *you and me* this round. this is where we're gonna *duel*.  nistro: and just so ya knowi don't plan on *losing*.  act 1 <<2:28  mr. heartland: ladiiiiies and gentlemen. there's only *one spot left* in the semifinals. who will advance. yuma tsukumo. or nistroooooo.  mr. heartland: we're about to find out as we watch them coast through the *desert field of danger*..  nistro: you *ready*. yuma: you *know it*.  nistro and yuma: let's duel.  nistro: i'm lookin' forward to *this*. my turn. i draw. to start things off, i'm calling forth heroic challenger double lance.  yuma and tori: whaa....   mr. heartland: whoa. looks like things are already getting a little *rocky*, 'cause in this field duelists take two hundred points of damage every time they attack or summon a monster in attack mode.  tori: after running into all of those traps, can you even *spare* two hundred lifepoints. yuma: ahh...  yuma: does it *look* like it. i've only got a hundred lifepoints left to my *name*. nistro: i activate double lance's ability. when i summon an xyz monster, heroic challenger double lance counts as *two* monsters. so now i overlay my *two* levelfour double lances.  nistro: with that, i build the overlay network and xyz summon, heroic champion gandiva.    nistro: rrgghh... astral: he does not seem to be concerned about the field spell damage. nistro: i place two cards facedownand end my turn. *all right*, yumayou're up. give me everything you've *got*. 'cause *this* time, i'm readyand i'm gonna take you down.. act 2 <<4:21  nistro: come on, yumagive me everything you've got.. yuma : considering how low my lifepoints are, i really don't have much to give. astral: yuma... you cannot waver. he is clearly feeling *energized*. you should become energized as well. yuma: tell me something i don't already *know*. it's my turn. i draw.. nistro: i got a little *trap action* for ya..  yuma: wha. uhoh. nistro: heheheheh. this is *crazy*. i can't believe i'm about to *do* this.  nistro : but yuma's dueling has really fired me up. he's the reason i'm *in* this tournament in the first place. i don't want this to be *handed* to me. i wanna *earn it*.  nistro: i've been looking forward to this duel for a *long time*..  nistro: i activate the trap, "heroic gift". if you've got less than two thousand lifepoints, this trap brings you back to *four* thousand points.  yuma: ughwait... you're giving *me* lifepoints. nistro: in exchange, i get to draw two more cards from my deck. yuma : you're giving me *pity points*.. nistro: don't think of it like *that*. i'm not exactly the type to have *pity* on someonei just wanna know that *when i win*, it's not 'cause i had an advantage. astral : if nistro was willing to so dramatically boost yuma's lifepoints, he must be feeling confident about this duel. yuma: i play a monster facedown in defense mode, nistro. astral: yumayou will not win this duel through defense alone.  yuma: next i place one card facedown, and with that, i end my turn.  nistro: hah. i was hopin' for a little more than *that*. you need a *push*. i draw. and now i summon, heroic challenger night watchman.  nistro: aagghh.  yuma: hey, nistrohow'd those two hundred points of *damage* taste.  nistro: very funny. but that was *nothin'*. at least not compared to what night watchman's about to do.   nistro: when night watchman attacks your facedown monster, it automatically destroys it.  nistro: and now your field is *wideopen*, yuma. which means gandiva can attack you directly. yuma: i was hoping you would do that. nistro: say *what*.. yuma: 'cause when mogmole is destroyed, it can dig down and then resurface in defense mode. i bet now you're wishing you hadn't given up those *four hundred lifepoints*, huh..  nistro: you think so. but you couldn't be more wrong, yuma. 'cause now, i can activate gandiva's special ability.  nistro: by using one overlay unit, my gandiva can destroy your mogmole.  yuma: this isn't good.  nistro: you can't just hide in defense mode, yumaunless of course you're a *coward*. all right, gandiva. attack yuma directly. yuma: we'll see about that, nistro. i play the trap, "battle break". it destroys your heroic champion gandiva and ends the battle. nistro: you think moves like *that* can save ya.. think *again*, kid. my "battler's pride" trap destroys your battle break, so gandiva is *still alive*.  nistro: now, gandivafire.  yuma: ugh.  nistro: i'll place one card facedown and end my turn.  nistro: aah. hah. don't you *get it*. you have to duel like i *know* you can if you wanna beat *me*. yuma: uuugghhh.  thing is, i know he's right, buti can't afford to make a mistake. astral: if that thought is what drives you, you should give up now. yuma: what.. astral: right now, your dueling is... hesitant. and a hesitant duelist *cannot* truly duel. yuma : ah.  astral : i suppose it is natural that you are feeling this way. after witnessing the intensity of the last several duels, it is logical that you would develop a cautionary approach toward your dueling.  yuma: *hold* *up*.. it sounds like you're saying i'm *scared*. well ii'm *not*. i draw.  astral: are you *certain*.  yuma: i summon, i summon gagaga magician.  nistro: watch your head, yuma.  yuma: aah. ugh. tori: ahh. yuma: hm. now i'm going to activate the spell card, "oneshot wand". this card grants my magician an additional eight hundred attack points.  yuma: which *means* it can take gandiva *down*. go, gagaga magician.. attack gandiva.  yuma: ugh. nistro: you're gonna have to try harder than *that*, yuma.. i activate my trap "heroic advance". it not only doubles night watchman's attack points, but gagaga magician now has to attack it instead of gandiva.  nistro: though neither monster will be destroyed, *you* still take damage.  yuma: ugghh. man. all righti activate oneshot wand's effect. i can destroy this card, and in exchange, i can draw a *new* one from my deck.  yuma: get ready for grandram. when you've got an xyz monster on your field, i can summon this *big bruiser* in attack mode.   yuma: sure, i'll lose another two hundred lifepoints yuma: but now i can overlay grandram and gagaga magician.  yuma: i build the overlay network and xyz summon, gagaga cowboy.    nistro: in *defense* mode.. *are you kidding me*.. yuma: nope. 'cause when gagaga cowboy's in defense mode, it not only protects me from when you attack, but it can use one overlay unit to blast you with eight hundred points of damage.  yuma: how d'ya like *that*. you're goin' *down*, nistro. i place two cards facedown and end my turn. nistro: i can't *believe* this. are you gonna hide behind your cards the *whole time*.. it's *totally pathetic*.. i wanted to duel *yuma*, not some *coward*.. yuma: huh. nistro : guess i need to force you to *step it up*. by equipping "xyz crown" on my gandiva, i'm allowed to use it to xyz summon.  nistro: and not only thatgandiva counts as *two* monsters. yuma: you mean, you're going to use an *xyz monster* to *xyz summon*.. nistro: i overlay *two* heroic champion gandivas, with my level four night watchman.  nistro: i build the overlay network, and xyz summon heroic champion kusanagi.  yuma: ahh. how'm i supposed to beat *this*. unhh.... act 3 <<11:49  nistro: come on. if you wanna defeat *me*, then let the *real* yuma start dueling. yuma: whaddaya mean, the *real yuma*. nistro: stop playing it safe and duel me like there's *no tomorrow*.  tori: yuma....  nistro : isn't that what it's *all about*, yuma.  tori: what's going on. why did we stop. yuma: ...i need you to stay here, tori. tori: huh. you want meyuma: yeah. i mean it. i've gotta risk everything if i'm gonna win this. and i don't wanna put you in *any kind of danger*.  tori: yuma...  tori: just one thingdon't forget to come back and *get me* when you win. yuma: i won't.   tori: you can do it, yuma..  yuma : hey, nistro..  yuma: if it's a real duel you want, then it's a real duel you'll *get*. nistro: now *that's* the yuma i wanted to duel. let's *do this*.  nistro: firsti activate the spell card "fighter's charm". this forces your cowboy into attack mode. *but*, its attack points stay the same as its defense points for the *rest of this turn*.  nistro: but that won't stop kusanagi from wiping the floor with gagaga cowboy.  yuma: i activate the trap card "overlay buster". thanks to *this* bad boy, my gagaga cowboy gains five hundred attack points.  yuma: i got this one. nistro: i don't *think* so, yuma. kusanagi stops your trap card *and* gains five hundred attack points for the rest of this turn.  yuma: three thousand.. no way. nistro: do it, kusanagi..  astral: now his monster is more powerful. nistro: let's go, kusanagi. destroy his gagaga cowboy. yuma: not gonna happen. i activate the spell card "fighting fund". this card protects my monster from being destroyed.  nistro: not badbut you're still takin' some damage. yuma: ahhaaaaaaahhhhhh.  yuma: that was close. nistro: i place two cards facedown, and end my turn. hmph. you've got *six hundred lifepoints* left. you're not doin' so good, are ya.  yuma: i started with a hundredso the way *i* see iti'm rockin' this thing. nistro: hmhahahahahahaha. *that's* the yuma i know. you showed up *just in time to lose*. huhahahahahahahahahahahah.  nistro: whuhaaaahhhh..  yuma: whoaoaoaoaoa..   nistro: what's this..  yuma: what the huh.. astral: we are on a *new* field. it is now "sunset showdown". each duelist can battle with *one monster only*, and when that monster is destroyed, its owner takes three hundred points of damage.  nistro: all right, yumayou ready.. yuma: i'm feelin' the flow... i draw. gagaga cowboy, take out nistro's kusanagi. nistro: kusanagi's not scared a' your cowboyconsidering it's packin' more attack points. yuma: for *now*but my cowboy can use one overlay unit to gain a thousand attack points and rob kusanagi of five hundred. nistro: huh. *nicely done*, kid. yuma: gagaga cowboy, attack.. nistro: i activate the trap, "heroic change". then i use kusanagi's special ability, to stop this trap, so that kusanagi can gain five hundred attack points.  yuma: ahh. nistro: ugh... now that was *awesome*.  nistro: you're an *amazing duelist*.  yuma: rright back atcha. uugghh... nistro: *but*... it's time to go *allin*. i activate the trap "xyz xtreme ..". since an xyz monster was *destroyed*, by paying one thousand lifepoints, we *both* summon new xyz monsters, and *then* they have to battle each *other*. hope you're ready'cause i'm bringin' out the best my deck has to offer. yuma: are you serious.. nistro: i summon heroic champion excalibur.  nistro: time to slice your lifepoints down to *nothing*..  yuma: whoa.... act 4 <<16:46  nistro: i summon heroic champion excalibur. but after our xyz monsters battle, they're both automatically destroyed because of the trap "xyz xtreme ..". so *bring it*, yuma. make this the ultimate showdown. go ahead and summon utopia.. yuma: utopia..... nistro: anything *less* would be *disappointing*. let's make this a *true* clash of the titans.  yuma: you're on. you are goin' *down*, nistro. nistro: *nice*.. yuma: i summon number thirtynine, utopia..   nistro: now. come at me, yuma.. yuma: you asked for it. utopia, attack. nistro: i activate excalibur's special ability. by using all its overlay units, its attack points *double*.  astral: four thousand attack points. yuma: utopia's got a special ability *too*, ya know. lightwing shield.  yuma: by using an overlay unit, i can stop excalibur's attack.  yuma: ya *can't touch me*. nistro: perhapsbut when the dust settles, both of our monsters will be destroyed by my xyz battle trap. and *then*, sunset showdown deals you three hundred points of damagewhich means you're finished. yuma: that *would* be the case, if i didn't have *this* card.  nistro: *what*.. yuma: i am feelin' the flow... i activate the spell "double or nothing." this spell doubles utopia's attack points, and lets it attack again.  nistro: ugghh. what.. it's got five thousand attack points. yuma: go, utopia. rising sun slash..  nistro: daaaahhhhhh...  mr. heartland: iiit's *over*. the duelist advancing to the semifinals isthe *one and only yuma*..   nistro: anyone get the license plate... on that rhino. heheheheh... yuma: nistro.  nistro: been a long time since a duel got me *that amped up*. that was *awesome*. yuma: yeeeah. nistro: heheh...  nistro: yuma, i want you to have this. yuma: huh. nistro: but in exchange, you gotta promise me that you'll give every duel everything you've got.  yuma: this is*excalibur*. but this is, like, your *best card* andastral : just, say 'thank you'. yuma: seriously. nistro, thanks so much. i'll do everything i can to make you proud. nistro: good. i'm countin' on ya, kid.  nistro: *win this thing*.  tori: come on, yuma, it's been *forever*... end <<<20:00> * special
