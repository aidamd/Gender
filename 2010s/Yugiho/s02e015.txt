  act 1 <<2:27  shark: this is *payback day*quatro. quatro: hello, shark... how are things. you still *upset* about our duel at the nationals. when you got *kicked out*. shark: that never would've happened if you didn't *set me up*.  quatro: ya got me *there*. hmhmhm. by the way, how *is* that precious *sister* of yours doing. yuma: shark's got a *sister*.   shark : what happened to her...  shark : is all *your* fault. i'll *never* forgive you.  shark : you made me lose sight of who i am as a person *and* as a duelist.  shark : i know i'll never get to change what i did back *then* shark: but todayi get my revenge.. quatro: heheh. well then let's duel. just make sure ya don't *peek at my deck*.  shark: huh.. what's this..  trey: a duel anchor.  trey: now you and i can't separate until we finish *our* duel. quatro: *trey*. this is between *shark and me*. you stay outta this. trey: ah, i'm *sorry*. but shark has no *numbers*, brother. so there isn't any need for you to duel against him, now is there. *vetrix always says* our mission comes first. quatro: rrrgghh.  i'll have to crush you *later*.  shark: you can't *leave*. come on. i *challenged* you.  quatro: well, if you want memake it to the finals.  quatro: i've already *got* my five heart pieces.  quatro: good luck, shark. huhuhahahahahaha.  shark: rrgghh. *quatro*... trey: calm down. you'll still get to duel, shark. you just get to duel *me* instead.  shark: rrrgghh.. astral : i have seen a *duel anchor* before. kite used one *just like it* against yuma.  astral : once it was attached, there was no escaping.  astral: it would seem that quatro and his brother are indeed number hunters. but *what purpose* do they need numbers *for*.  tori: let's get kazwell some help. bronk: right. yuma: hey, i'd better come with you guys. bronk: no. you stay here and support shark. we can take care a' kazwell, don' worry. astral: yuma... yuma: huh. astral: i agree that you should remain here. yuma: all right. i'll stay, then.  shark: guess i'll have to deal with your brother after i beat *you*. it's *crunch time*, huah..  trey: i'm prepped and primed. heheh.  shark: then let's *settle this*.  shark: ready when *you are*.  computer: authentic reality vision link established. shark and trey: let's duel.  trey: i'll go firstokay, shark. ready or not, i draw.. to start, i'll activate the field spell "sunken kingdom".  trey: now any waterattribute monsters that get played gain three hundred attack points.   yuma: yaahh. they shoulda warned us we'd be underwater.. give me an oxygen tank, quick.. astral: yuma, this ocean is *virtual*, remember. yuma: eh. aaaahhhhh.  trey: next i summon my chronomaly mayan machine.  trey: and now i'll *end* things with a facedown and turn it over to you, shark.  yuma: uh, what's that chronomanathingy. astral: you mean *chronomaly*. they are artifacts that are too advanced to have been built by your primitive ancestors. *who* made them, or where they came from, is a mystery. shark: nowi draw.. i'm summoning, hammer shark.  shark: thanks for playin' this sunken kingdom field spell. since my hammer shark is a water monster, it gets three hundred attack points stronger.  trey: unfortunately for *you*, monsters that are levelfour or below can't attack chronomaly monsters in the sunken kingdom. hammer shark is *useless* here. shark: you think this field can shield your monster. *but*i have a "falling current" spell card. this spell lets me pick a level for my monster between one and three, so i'm gonna lower my hammer shark by *one level*. trey: i see your deck is full of surprises, shark. but lowering your monster's level won't help you very much. shark: heheh. tell that to *big jaws*..  shark: since i activated a spell card this turn, i can let big jaws loose to help me take a bite outta your strategy. but before i do *anything*, big jaws powers up by three hundred points.  shark: and now i'll overlay my levelthree hammer shark and big jaws, in order to build the overlay network.  shark: nowi xyz summon, black ray lancer..   shark: since xyz monsters don't have levels, sunken kingdom can't stop them from attacking your mayan machines. yuma: all right. great move. shark: black ray lancer, go.. attack with shimmering spear slash.  act 2 <<7:52 shark: black ray lancer, go.. attack with shimmering spear slash.  trey: ahh. ...rrgghh. i activate, "stonehenge methods". when my chronomaly monster is destroyed, i can summon *any* rocktype chronomaly monster that's levelfour or below in defense mode.  trey: so i summon my chronomaly colossal head.   shark: hm. guess i've done *enough* damage for *one* turn.  shark: you're up. trey: if you insist. i draw. and i summon chronomaly golden jet.   trey: and now i'm gonna activate the spell card "orichalcum chain". this chain gives me a *missing link* when i need it. so when i want to xyz summon, i can do it using one fewer monster. shark: *really*. trey: but, using the spell *can* be quite risky. if my chain is destroyed... you gain control of the xyz monster that i summon *with* it. but there's no way i'm gonna let *that* happen, so do yourself a favor and don't even bother trying. it's time to put my spell card into action.  trey: so i'll overlay levelfour colossal head and golden jet. then, with the help of my orichalcum chain, i can build the overlay network.  trey: i xyz summon, number thirtytwo shark drake.   shark: very impressive. trey: it gets *better*. remember, sunken kingdom will add three hundred attack points to shark drake's total.  trey: okay, shark drake, strike down black ray lancer. go, deep sea destruction..  trey: i activate shark drake's special ability. after it destroys a monster in battle, i can use an overlay unit to summon the monster it just destroyed back onto your field. only *now* it's a thousand attack points weaker. then shark drake can battle that monster all over again.  trey: that's double the attacks for *me*, and double the *pain* for *you*. yuma: that sounds totally unfair. he can attack shark's monster *again*. astral: indeed... the ability is quite rare. it is also *quite effective*. trey: shark drake is the most relentless attacker you've ever seen. it's gonna destroy your monster *all over again*. go. deep sea destruction..  yuma: shark..  yuma: shark. ya gonna be okay..  shark: i'm gonna be *fine*. one or two attacks aren't enough to beat *me*. trey: hehehwell, just to be sure, i'll give you a break and *end my turn*.  trey: *but*, if you don't find a way to stop shark drake, this duel is *over*. yuma: what can shark *do*. he's *donefor*.... astral: there is still one way for him to prevail in this duel.  yuma: huh. shark : i *must* take his number. act 3 <<11:26  shark: your number's gonna be mine.  and i'll stop at *nothing* to *get* it.. i summon, skull kraken.  shark: and now i'm activating skull kraken's special ability.  shark: once i summon *this* monster, i can destroy a faceup spell or trap card that's on your field.  shark: so i'm destroying your orichalcum chain.  shark: i *did it*. shark drake is under *my control* now.  trey : *perfect*. now that you've done exactly what i *wanted* you to do, i can complete my mission. thanks for the *help*, shark.  shark: rrrrrrrrrgggghhhhhhhaaaaaaaaaagggghhhh. yuma: what's wrong.. shark: aaaagghhaaagghhaaaaaahhhh.   vision shark drake: shaaaaaark... you will let me enter your mind and soul.  vision shark drake: with me as your ally, you will no longer need the help of your socalled 'friends'.   fb shark: you're a good duelist. i'll see ya 'round. fb yuma: thanks. and heymaybe we can do this again sometime.  fb yuma: aw come on. i thought we were *friends*.  fb shark: rrrrggghhhh, we are *not friends*.. you got that.. why would you even think that *anyway*.. fb yuma: why would i think we're friends. because we *dueled*.   vision shark drake: i am all that you need in this world. let me take hold.  vision shark: i don't need you.  vision shark: *i won't let you control me*...  shark i'm in control, and you will obey *me*..   shark: okay... *let's go*.. trey : he should've been possessed by the number. astral: shark has mastered number thirtytwo's power. yuma: no *way*.  shark: your plan *backfired*, trey. go get 'em, shark drake. deep sea destruction.. yuma: do it. if this works trey will get damaged *bigtime*. trey: no i won't. i activate the trap, "antikythera gear". i can use this if you attack me directly when you have two or more monsters on your field.  trey: it lets me take control of your nonattacking monster and put it in defense mode. shark: not so fast. i activate, my own trap card.  shark: "extreme pressure power" lets me destroy one a' my monsters, and then draw a card from my deck. looks like i just outtrapped your trap. trey: ugh. shark: keep up with your attack.. come on, shark drake.  shark: i'll put two cards facedown an' end my turn.  trey : he's tougher than we thought...  my mission was *simple*to give shark a number.  trey : once i finished my assignment, vetrix told me i should just let shark win the duel.  trey : but he never said that i had to make it *easy* for 'im.  *now*, sharki draw.. and i play the spell, "chronomaly technology". now if i banish a chronomaly monster from my graveyard, i get to draw two new cards from my deck. then i send one to the graveyard.  i summon chronomaly crystal bones in attack mode.   trey: i can summon *this* card when you're the only one who has monsters on the field.  trey: and crystal bones's special ability lets me bring back chronomaly crystal skull from the graveyard. rise up, crystal skull..   trey: *now* i overlay my levelthree crystal skull and crystal bones.  trey: with these two monsters, i build the overlay network, and xyz summonchronomaly crystal chrononaut.   trey: if i use an overlay unit, it can't be destroyed in battle this turn. and not only that, *you* would take the damage that *i* would've taken.  shark: say *what*.. trey: to put it simply, your shark drake has a lot more attack points than my chronomaly crystal chrononaut. *a thousand more*.  trey: and those extra points are gonna come *right at you*. crystal chrononaut, attack shark drake. go, reflect flash.  act 4 <<<16:21>  trey: attack shark drake. yuma. not good. if this attack works, then. trey: face it, shark, you are *sunk*. shark: then i'll get *unsunk*. with the spell "plate salvage".  shark: it's *time for a change of scenery*.  shark: now your field spell sunken kingdom can't work for two turns..   yuma: whoawho drained the *bathtub*.... shark: that means sunken kingdom's effect is history. so now shark drake loses three hundred attack points.  astral: brilliant. by eliminating the field spell's effect, shark lowered his monster's attack points on purpose to limit its damage and save himself. yuma: only they're both down to just three hundred lifepoints. astral: this next attack should determine the winner. trey : i can't *believe* it. shark is great at thinking on his feet. so i'm *sure* he'll try to use shark drake's special ability. i *should* just let 'im win this duelbut where's the fun in *that*.  trey: i'm ending my turn. throw your best at me, shark. shark: rrrghh, i*draw*.. okay, shark drake, shatter that crystal chrononaut.  trey: not so fast. i'll use colossal head's special ability to put the brakes on shark drake. when i banish this chronomaly monster from my graveyard, i can switch the monster on my field from attack to defense mode.  trey: uuugghhh. yuma: i don't like this. trey can't take damage when a monster is in *defense mode*. astral: *perhaps*... yuma: huh. shark: i activate shark drake's special ability. by using an overlay unit, when shark drake destroys a monster in battle, it can bring it back onto *your field*. but *don't forget*the revived monster now has one thousand less attack points, and that's gonna make *you* a *prime target*.  shark: if you were hoping i'd forget shark drake's special ability, you were wrong. so nowattack, shark drake.  trey: actually, i was *right*. you see, i *knew* you'd master that number's special ability. so i'm ready with my trap, "chronomaly ley line power". shark: a trap.. trey: exactly. it's a trap that can exchange the attack points of the two monsters that're battling.  trey: so now my crystal chrononaut is stronger than shark drake. hahahahaha.  trey: sorry, shark, but it's *over*.  shark: *yes it is*. trey: whoa. shark: ya see i *expected* you to pull a move like *that*. so i had the *ultimate counter card* up my sleeve to finally put an end to this duel.  trey: uuuuuuugh. shark: it's the trap card, "sea king's verdict". if your trap card activated during a battle, this one *cancels it out*. trey: *cancels it out*..  shark: shark drake, let's finish this duel, and finish them off.  trey: ohhh *noooooo.*   yuma: *amazing*. shark totally reeled that guy in. astral: this was a most impressive victory...  trey: not bad, shark. you get *this* win. but next time will be *different*.  trey: i made it to the finalsand i look forward to facing you there. yuma: how did he win so many duels already. trey: you can hold onto that number card if you want. think of it as a souvenir of our duel.  yuma: ah. where'd he go.  yuma: huh. oh.  tori : yuma. yuma: how's kazwell, tori. tori : he'll be okay. the med team told us he just needs *lots of rest*. yuma: that's great. i'll be over as soon as i canhuh.  yuma: shark, wait. shark: listen, yuma. i wantcha to keep your *distance*.  shark: i still have a score to settle with quatro.. yuma: but shark. *why isn't he letting us help him*.  come baaack.. astral : now that shark has another number, we will certainly have to duel him again someday.  vetrix: that's *excellent work*, trey. shark won't suspect a thing because of the way you let him win.  trey: to be honest, i think shark would've won no matter *how* hard i tried. vetrix: you're just being *modest as usual*. trey: but, sir. shark wasn't possessed by the number. so i failed. vetrix: not at *all*.  vetrix : your mission was a success. there is now a seed of darkness inside shark's soul that will grow over time.   vetrix : *consuming him completely*. ahahahahahahahahaha.. end <<21:30 *
