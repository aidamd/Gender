 quinton: you're *eager*, kite. *too* eager.  kite: i promisethis ends *today*.  kite : you won't escape from me, chris. or quinton. or whatever you call yourself now.  kite : payback day is finally here.   act 1 <<1:24  bronk: what a bummer. i can't believe we *still* can't watch any of the duels that are happenin'. there must be trouble with the video feed. kazwell: i hope they fix it quick.  orbital: aaahhh, i'm so *worried*. my processors *won't rest* 'til i find out if master kikite is safe or not.  orbital: tto catch up with him, i have to .  yuma: i wonder where this crazy coaster's taking us. tori: who knows. at *this* speed everything is just a blur. yuma: i can't slow down 'til i get to a field for my oneonone duel. astral: but if you crash, you may not be able to have *any* duels. tori: what will happen if you run into another trap, yuma..  yuma: i dunno, but maybe something like that.  orbital: waaaahhhhh..  orbital: thisthis is not my ddday... yuma: orbital. orbital : yumamamamamamamama. d'you know where master kkkite is.. tori: you sound funny. are you okay.  orbital:  that *grouchy girl* is tagging along ttoo.  tori: *watch it*, or i'll rearrange your wiring. orbital: *pplease*, ddon't do that.  i have to go and fiiind master kkite. yuma: so *that's* why you're here.  yuma : there's something important that i have to talk to kite about, too.   yuma: all right... we can track down kite together, then. help me to locate 'im, okay, orbital. orbital: right. scanning now...  quinton: at last. i knew you and i would face each other in battle someday, kite.  quinton : ever since i learned the truth about your family and mine, i've been filled with a desire to get revenge.  quinton : i swore that *nothing* would stop me from settling the score.  quinton: *nothing*, kite.  kite: you're gonna regret what you did to hart. i'll make *sure* of that. quinton and kite: now let's duel..  quinton: *i'll* go first. get seti draw. i summon planet pathfinder.   quinton: next up, i summon solar wind jammer in attack mode. i'm allowed to summon this monster by cutting its attack points in half.   quinton: nexti'll give both monsters an upgrade by activating my "tannhauser gate" spell. now my monsters combine their levels. my monsters are level four and five, kite. that means they'll both become level *nine* monsters. kite: i can *guess* what's coming *next*. quinton: hmhmhmhm. i *doubt it*. i overlay my level nine pathfinder and wind jammer in order to build the overlay network.  quinton: i xyz summon number nine, dyson sphere. kite: a number....  kite: where is your number, quinton.  quinton: you will discover that soon enough, i promise. in the meantime, since i xyz summoned, this space field's effect kicks in. it allows me to draw *one card*.  heheheh. i'll place a card facedown, and end my turn.  kite: ugh... that number. must be somewhere. quinton: it's *your turn*. you're looking a little *worried*, kite. what's wrong. kite: *nothing*. i *draw*.  kite : i know that number is out there somewhere. but even if i *can't* see it, i have to try to take it down.  here goes. i summon, photon delta wing.   kite: photon delta wing, attack dyson sphere. photon fury.  quinton: that was useless. your attack couldn't possibly do any damage. kite: how...could that be..... quinton: wouldn't *you* like to know. too bad this'll be over before you have answers. i draw.. now i'll attack your photon delta wing with my dyson sphere. kite: what..  kite: aahhhhhhhhh.  kite: how in the world did you *do* that, quinton. quinton: you wouldn't understand. just accept it, i have you hopelessly outmatched and you're going to lose.  act 2 <<6:40  tori: oh, wow. our duel coaster is now a *space* coaster. astral: this field *is* virtual, of course, but *quite* realistic. orbital: i'm ppicking up a dueltab iddentification signal. it's definitely master kikite. yuma: he must be aboard that ship. tori: you better slow down or we're gonna make a *crash landing*.  yuma: there's something wrong with the controls, they're not responding.  orbital: ohh... tori: ugh... next time, *i'll* do the driving. orbital: master kite. what a relief to see you're safe. yuma: huh.  yuma: listen, kite...  i have something important to tell you. kite: *really*. yuma: yeah. it's about dextra. she was in a duel.  yuma: against vetrix. she was defeated.  yuma: i saw it. dextra was trying to stand up for you.  yuma : but vetrix was too strong.  yuma: it's clear that she *really cares* about you.  kite: *i* couldn't care *less*. yuma: ah... you can't mean that. tori: that's cold. orbital: ohh, master kikite...  yuma: rrgh, she did everything to try and protect you. quinton: so, it's yuma tsukumo.  yuma: huh. quinton: the son of *kazuma* tsukumo. yuma: it's *you*. quinton: it's fitting that the three of us should meet now. destiny has clearly brought us together. yuma: ugh, i want some answers from you. listentell me where my father is. quinton: all right. before kite and i *resume*, i'll tell you *everything i know* about your father.  kite: i wanna *duel* now. you can share your story some other time. are we gonna continue to battle, or *not*. quinton: it can *wait*. the story that i'm about to tell concerns *you* as well. perhaps it will help *all of you* understand my family's actions. why we came here to compete in the duel carnival.  quinton: and why we targeted kite... and his brother hart. the answer is that they are linked to our *real* enemy. *we* seek revenge against their *father*doctor faker.  yuma: doctor faker is their father..  yuma : the same guy who built up heart land..  quinton: it began five years ago.  quinton : back then, doctor faker and my father, byron arklight, were working together on experiments, in search of a door that could lead to other worlds.  fb dr. faker: egh... the twentyone anomalies i detected should lead me to the location. but it isn't *working*. it seems there's something *missing* in my calculations.  fb dr. faker: it's *driving me mad*.. fb arklight: doctor faker, please. have a cup of tea and try to relax.  fb dr. faker: there isn't any *time* to relax. arklighti have to open that portal before it's too late..  fb arklight: doctor... don't forget, there is someone else looking for the portal who might be able to help us. hey, chris fb arklight: bring up the file we discussed. fb chris: yes. sure, father. one second. fb arklight: if anyone can help us, it's *this man*. one of the world's most daring adventurers...  fb arklight: kazuma tsukumo.  fb kazuma: what an *incredible* view... and i have it all to myself. there's no one else around for at least a *hundred miles*.  fb kazuma : of course, i... *could be wrong*... act 3 <<10:12  fb kazuma: whoa. quite the impressive layout you've got here. fb arklight: welcome.  fb arklight: i'm sorry to have interrupted your trip so suddenly, kazuma tsukumo. but i'm glad you came.  fb arklight: i'm byron arklight, and it is an *honor* to meet you.  fb kazuma: these are the most advanced gravitational wave scans i've ever seen. fb dr. faker: but they're not advanced *enough*..  fb dr. faker: i've tried every possible technology, but still can't find the interdimensional portal. it *must* exist.. i'm *sure* of it. but there's something we're *missing*.. fb arklight: kazumayou've been looking for the portal, too. would you be willing to share your research with us.  fb kazuma: if we succeed, it will change the course of human history. you will become famous, and rich beyond your wildest dreams.  fb dr. faker: money and fame. they're of no interest to me. all i care about is locating that interdimensional portal.  fb kazuma: hm. in *that* case, we *can* work together. fb arklight: that was a test... wasn't it. fb kazuma: the living for adventure and the thrill of discovery are all *i* care about. fb arklight: i'd say we've found the right partner. fb dr. faker: take a look at *this*.  fb dr. faker: arklight and i have detected abnormal gravity readings at twentyone different locations around the globe. we believe these readings indicate where the interdimensional portal has emerged in the past.  fb dr. faker: by analyzing this data, we were hoping to predict where the portal will next appear. fb kazuma: so you based your prediction on this data. fb dr. faker: yes, the calculation is quite complicated.  *i almost have it solved*.. but there's *one piece missing*. fb kazuma: ...no. you're missing *two* pieces. your observations are incomplete, doctor.  fb kazuma: some observations can only be made *outside* a laboratory. i found two more locations on my expeditions. there are twenty*three* data points. fb dr. faker: huh.... then that's why my calculations have been off. fb kazuma: right. do your math over and you should have no trouble locating the portal.  quinton : kazuma was right. with the additional data he supplied, doctor faker reworked his calculations. he soon identified the location where the portal would appear next. we raced there as quickly as we could.  fb kazuma: reaching that portal won't be easy. we have a challenging trek before us, my friends. fb arklight: you'd better stay here, chris. i'll go on with doctor faker and kazuma. fb chris: good luck.  quinton: that was the last time i saw all of them together. but i know what happened after they left me. when i finally saw my father again, he told me everything.  quinton : following doctor faker's calculations, and with kazuma guiding the group, they pressed onward.  fb arklight: kazuma... what if after all this effort, we arrive at the location and there is no portal. fb kazuma: even if we fail in our quest, it will be worth the effort. anyway... the most important thing is that we never give up, and keep feeling the flow. fb arklight: 'feeling the flow'.  fb kazuma: it's something i tell my son... so that he never gives up. fb arklight: that's your family, kazuma. fb kazuma: yes.  my son yuma is really into dueling. fb arklight: mine, too. i have *three* sons, myself, and dueling means everything to them.  fb arklight: doctor faker also has sons. two of them. fb kazuma: do you know why he's so *obsessed* with finding that interdimensional portal. fb arklight: i'm not sure. but if anyone can locate it, *he* can. doctor faker is a true genius.  fb dr. faker: the runes i found were very clear. 'deliver two souls for mysteries untold'.  fb dr. faker: souls, huh. hnh...  quinton : three days later, the group finally arrived at the location...  fb arklight: gentlemen, i think we've found what we're seeking. fb dr. faker: arklightlook here.  fb dr. faker: i saw this rune in my research. it's true. we've *found the portal*.. success at last. and now we just have to open it. let's hurry.  fb kazuma: ahwatch out..  act 4 <<14:47  fb kazuma: watch out.. fb arklight: doctor faker. kazuma.  fb kazuma: *don't move*.  fb kazuma: listen, byron. we have to proceed carefully. this whole location must be filled with traps.  fb kazuma: whoever built this place *didn't* want trespassers. if you want to leave here in one piece, i suggest you watch your step.  fb arklight: looks like we've reached a dead end. fb kazuma: *that's* strange. maybe we took a wrong turn. fb arklight: should we go back.  fb kazuma: what's this..  fb dr. faker: gentlemen, the time has finally come. fb kazuma: doctor faker.....  fb dr. faker: believe mei regret that there is no other way. fb arklight: doctorwhat's going on here.. fb dr. faker: the writing beneath your feet explains everything. the ancient inscription reads, 'deliver two souls for mysteries untold'. fb arklight: you planned to betray us all along. didn't you. fb dr. faker: i have sworn to open a passage to other worlds, and *nothing will stop me*.. fb kazuma: you've lost your mind. how can you do this, doctor, how can you betray your friend.. fb dr. faker: a *friend*. so what.  fb dr. faker: all that ever mattered to me was reaching my goal. byron was useful for a *time*, but now he's expendable.  fb arklight: whoaaaaaaa. fb kazuma: hah. i've got you, byron, just *hang on*.. fb arklight: kazumasave yourself. let go of my hand. fb kazuma: my son always tells me, when he duels with someone, then they become friends forever. it's the same for me. anyone who goes exploring with me will always be my friend. we're in this together. fb arklight: all right. fb dr. faker: enough.. the portal is open. and you're *both finished*.  fb kazuma: waaaahhhhhh.... fb arklight: you'll pay for this, fakerrrrrrr.....  quinton: my father couldn't believe how faker betrayed them. yuma: and that was the last anyone saw of my father. astral : 'deliver two souls for mysteries untold'.... that sounds like an xyz summon. quinton: yuma, one day my father *did return*.  quinton : he found a way to travel through interdimensional gaps between worlds, until he reached this world again. however, there was a price. his appearance became *warped* until he was no longer recognizable.  quinton : my father now calls himself *vetrix*.   orbital: iiiiii.... yuma: i thought he was a *kid*. quinton: it's all faker's fault. he betrayed my father, and i've sworn to one day get revenge. kite: this doesn't change *anything*. doctor faker means nothing to me. i only care about hart. and getting even for what you did.. *move away*, yuma. it's my turni draw.. to start, i summon photon thrasher.  kite: i can bring out thrasher when i don't have any other monsters on my field. and i'll follow that up by summoning photon pirate.  kite: when i banish a photon monster from my graveyard , photon pirate gets a thousand attack points stronger.  kite: i tribute my photon thrasher, and my photon pirate.  kite: here comes a monster more savage than a *supernova*.. with the cataclysmic force of *ten* black holes put together, a cosmic scourge that vaporizes *anything* in its path..  kite: galaxyeyes photon dragon..  quinton : you're playing into my hands *perfectly*, kite. kite : let's see, my delta wing had eighteen hundred attack points...  kite : it was destroyed on my *last* turn and i got hit with one thousand points of damage.  kite : so then quinton's invisible number must have twentyeight hundred attack points.  galaxyeyes.. use your three thousand attack points to pummel number nine. quinton: big mistake. kite: we'll see. go, photon stream of destruction..  kite: it failed. quinton: of course it did. to understand *why*, take a look at my number.   yuma : no way. tori: a monster bigger than the sun.  kite:  that's *so huge*. how could any monster ever destroy it. it seems *impossible*.  quinton: that's because it *is* impossible. no one has *ever* defeated dyson sphere in battle, and no one *ever will*..   end <<20:09 * special thanks to animeratio.com for the copy of this episode transcribed online. * special thanks to yugioh wikia as a source for checking cards. * special thanks to kazuki takahashi, 4kids, et al. for yugioh. zexal. last updated: may 17, 2013 i don't own yugioh zexal, at all, and this transcript is unofficial and without any permission whatsoever. please link back to me if you use my work. for more information about my transcript format, please click here. read my blog post on this episode here  )
