  act 1 <2:08>   nelson : you can't defeatthe sparrow. yuma: ugh.... oh, man. he really thinks he's a superhero.  fb nelson's mom: think about how many people *depend* on you being the sparrow.  fb nelson: nelson andrews doesn't matter.  yuma: *she's* what this is all about.  yuma: the number card wouldn't be messing with him like this if it wasn't for his mom. ... i got it.  tori: huh. you have *any idea* how late it is.  yuma: tori. ya gotta listen to me. it's important. *i need you and bronk to find nelson's mom*. tori: huh. tori : who's *nelson*. yuma: oh, um, right, umokay, looki'm dueling nelson andrews, aka *the sparrow* right now. you know that *scary lady* who produces the show. *that's his mom*. i need you to find her, and bring her here to the sound stageshe needs to see this.  tori: okay, yuma... <3:00>  i'll find her.  tori : i'll see ya soon.  yuma: okay. i *know* that you're still in there, nelson. but don't worryi'm gonna do whatever it takes to *get you back*. astral: yuma... star sparrow can deal damage even if your monster is in defense mode this turn. if you want to survive that attack, you need utopia. yuma: d'you think i don't *know that*, astral. problem is, i've got only one levelfour monster in my hand.  yuma: so unless i manage to get another one on my next draw, busting out utopia's a nogo.  no sense in waiting. i draw.  yuma: all right. i summon gagaga magician to the field.  yuma: and that lets me summon kagetokage as well.   yuma: now, since *both* of 'em are levelfour, i can build the overlay network, and xyzsummon number thirtynineutopia. <4:00>   astral: i would advise you to use this moment to defeat at least one monster. yuma: well *yeah*, *duh*. i wanna take out *galaxy queen*, but i can't 'cause of furious max's curse. astral: interesting. yuma: what. what's interesting. astral: you are not *arguing* with me tonight. yuma: well, *yeah*. believe it or not, not everything is *about you*. this duel is about *saving nelson*. astral: ...*i* want to save him, as well. yuma: you're acting different *too*, ya know. it's not like *you* to fixate so much on someone else. astral: nelson... is lonely. yuma: huh.  fb nelson: nelson andrews doesn't matter.  astral: i think i *understand* that feeling... and so i want to help. yuma: *you're* lonely.... astral: it would seem that you and i can work well together when our goals are one in the same. <5:00> yuma: rrrgghh, stop trying to get buddybuddy on me. are we gonna do this thing or not. astral: let us do it. yuma: nice. all right, big guy, it's all you. attack beast warrior puma. nelson : not good enough. 'cause i play the "wings of unity" trap. and since i played it with esper star sparrow on my field, i can put a *stop* to your attack.  nelson : and *furthermore*it *also* lets me summon phoenix beast gairuda.   yuma: if he keeps bringing monsters out like this, we're donefor. act 2 <5:40>  yuma: that gairuda looks like trouble.  gairuda: did someone say my name. esper star sparrow: glad you could swing by. puma: what took ya so long, gairuda. gairuda: ludwig captured the syndarian princess again. yuma: is it just *me*, or are these guys totally acting like they do on the tv show. <6:00> astral: ah... how wonderful to see it play out before my very eyes.... puma: you didn't abandon the *princess*, did you. gairuda: *no*. i defeated the troll, saved the girl, and now i'm here. esper star sparrow: i'm glad you are. you, too, puma. puma and gairuda: of course.  yuma: that's nice. those guys seem to really have a *thing*. astral: i don't know why, but there is a strange *warmth* filling my heart. yuma : huh. we can't be *admiring* them. we're supposed to be *worried and freaked out* that he has *four monsters* on his field.  nelson : now, due to phoenix beast gairuda's ability, i'm able to draw one card from my deck. yuma: this is *not good*. i have no idea what to do. astral: you have to get defensive. go with the card on the right.  yuma: you sure. astral: positive.  yuma: well you *better be right*, astral. i play one card facedown and end my turn. nelson : it's my turn. i draw. i'm summoning another ally to join me. hnh. <7:00> yuma: ahh, *'nother* one.. nelson : when esper star sparrow, beast warrior puma, and phoenix beast gairuda are united on my field, i can summon their *friend* from my handforged in a factory on the dsix asteroidthe hero of kaylos.ironhammer the giant..  yuma: ohh. yaahh.   yuma: ugh.... esper star sparrow: ironhammerya made it.  astral: ironhammer was built by doctor implausible. the doctor almost tossed him into the lava pits of kelsidor, because he did not have enough screws in his head. but the sparrow swooped in and saved him.  ironhammer: duuhh, whaddaya need me to do, boss. yuma: that looks like a toy robot i used to play with, but *real*.  and *really* huge.. tori: yuma.  bronk: we got the lady. tori: quick warning, she's not happy.  nelson's mom: what is going *on*. what is the meaning of nelson's mom: *nelson*. is that *you*.  what are you doing here, it's past your bedtime. <8:00> *how* did you get past the guards. *explain yourself*, young man. *right now*..  nelson : are you speaking to *me*.. nelson's mom: i *hardly* think that's an appropriate tone to take with *your mother*. nelson : my *mother*. i think you might be confused. my mother is right here.   nelson's mom: ah.... *nelson*...  nelson : my name isn't nelsoni am known as the one and only *sparrow*. nelson's mom: i'm *not* playing around, nelson. yuma: hey, nelson's mom. tori, bronk, and mom: huh. yuma: you know how someone was running around and attacking people dressed as the sparrow.. nelson's mom: yes... yuma: it's him. it was nelson. nelson's mom: that is *preposterous*.  it can't be true. yuma: you pressured him so much to be the sparrow that now he thinks he *is*. nelson's mom: ah.... yuma: he doesn't know how to be himself anymore, he's stuck in the *friction world*. tori: *friction*.... bronk : ...think he meant to say, 'stuck in the *fiction* world.' tori: oh. nelson's mom: this can't be.... nelson. galaxy queen: the sparrow lives only to serve *me.* <9:00> ahahahahahaha. nelson's mom: i do *not* cackle like that, i nelson's mom: uugghh. you're in *big trouble*, young man. when we get back to the yuma: will you knock it off.. i think you should just watch this duel, nelson's mom. this duel will show you how he sees you, and what you've done to him.  nelson : let us continue. i'm using an overlay unit to once again activate galaxy queen's ability. just as before, the galaxy queen grants all my monsters immortalityand the ability to deal damage even if your monster is in defense mode this turn.  galaxy queen: feel the power of darkness flowing through you.  galaxy queen: embrace this power. defeat those who would defy me. nelson : yes, my queen. i activate gairuda's ability. so now it gains three hundred attack points.  nelson : go, gairuda. attack utopia. astral: yumayuma: i *know*, i'm on it. i use one overlay unit <10:00> to activate utopia's ability. and with *that*, gairuda's attack is *shut down*.  nelson : perhapsbut there's *still* plenty more where that came from. i am just getting started. esper star sparrow, take out utopia with megapunch surprise. yuma: *bring it on*'cause i can activate utopia's ability again, and block your attack. nelson : but *now* utopia has no overlay units. *meanwhile*, i've still got some tricks up my sleeve. yuma: rrgghh... nelson : allow me to show you what i mean, by activating ironhammer's special ability. since ironhammer is on my field, one of my monsters can attack *directly*.  yuma: oh, no. nelson : go, puma. this is your moment. go, dark slash.  bronk: uh.... tori: you okay.. yuma: yeahi'm fine.  <11:00> astral: *i'm* not. i'm fading away.... act 3 <11:06>  yuma: this is *not good*. astral: yuma, quickly. activate your trap card. yuma: ahare you *sure*. astral: you *have to trust me*. yuma: ...all right. i activate my trap. astral: the trap is "heartfelt appeal", and we can activate it because we took damage from his direct attack. yuma: great, but, what will the trap do. astral: it gives us control of his monster with the highest defense points, until the end of our next turn. yuma: whoa.  ironhammer: that's better. nelson : ironhammer. what is this.. you're *turning against us*.. ironhammer: duhh, i can't help it, boss, i just suddenly had the urge to protect this weakling behind me. yuma : you mean *me*, don't you. nelson : you'll pay for this. but for now, i'm ending my turn with a facedown card.  yuma: so, um, why did we snag ironhammer. i mean, if he's gonna go back to sparrow's side on this next *turn*, <12:00> thenastral: it was the right move. taking the giant was a necessary step toward defeating them. yuma: if you say so, then you say so, butlook, if you've got a plan then fill me in, okay. *or be like that*. astral: i know how things will unfold. yuma: huh.. how d' *you* know. astral: because i saw the ending of the tv show.  yuma: ahh. *i can't believe you based our strategy on a science friction show*.. rgh. forget itmoving on.   yuma: ah, man, i'm just not sure what to do. but i can't give up.  yuma : okaythis oughta buy me some *time*...  i now activate the "attraffic control" spell card. so as long as you've got three or more monsters on your field, this spell will prevent you from being able to attack.  astral: yumathat is it. yuma: hang *on* a sec. astral: you did it. the pieces are all in place. we are going to win this. yuma: are you sure we're dueling the same duel.. <13:00> 'cause in the duel *i'm* dueling, the galaxy queen can't be destroyed thanks to furious max's curse, and all the *other* monsters can't be destroyed thanks to the *galaxy queen**everyone's* invincible. astral: it is just like the show. yuma: ugh, here we go... astral: i *saw* this episode. ... trust me. sparrow gathered his allies together  astral : and transformed ironhammer into the dimensional iron jet.   astral: and together, they defeated the taurian prince. yuma: just join the *fan club* already. astral: listen. play those two cards in your hand.  yuma: huh.... play *both* of 'em.  yuma: i really hope i don't regret this... i'm playing *two cards facedown*, and ending my turn.  nelson : you're trying to stall. but this ends now..  i draw. firstyour trap card's effect wears off. so ironhammer returns to *my* field.  ironhammer: uhh, what was i doing just now. galaxy queen: you must put a stop to this threat. <14:00>  nelson  and esper star sparrow: i will do as you say, mother.  nelson's mom: i don't like this. nelson, listen to mewe're going back to the hotel, we'll get some... ice cream.  nelson's mom: you don'thave to be the sparrow right now, you can just be yournelson : that's enough.. i have to be the sparrow. *do you have any idea* how many people are depending on me..  nelson's mom: ... nelson... nelson : you think you managed to cage me in with attraffic controlbut i'm activating the "change to jet iron" trap card. when sparrow and his allies are all gathered on the field together...  nelson : they can unite to form the dimensional iron jet.  yuma: whoa.... nelson : with twin titanium engines, and dual sonic thrusters nelson : dimensional iron jet packs enough attack power to defeat you, and win this duel.    act 4 <14:56> yuma: ah, man, that thing has enough attack power <15:00> to end this duel right now.. astral: deep breath. just play a trap card. yuma: ah. trap card. play a *trap card*.. daah. which one should i activate.... oh, wait. i need some *duel fuel*.  yuma: ah, there we go. tori: he must really be unsure...  yuma: i am totally feelin' the flow. now *about that trap card*i give you "fiery fervor".  tori: all *right*. that trap doubled utopia's attack points. bronk: maybe so, but iron jet is *still* more powerful. yuma: aah. can i take that move back. nelson : not a chance, yuma. and as much as i hate to kick you when you're down, i'd like to point out that my four monsters have become onewhich means your attraffic control spell is no longer effective. yuma: wah. astral: activate a trap. yuma: huh. guess we got nothing better to do. i'm activating the "reserve cyclone" trap. <16:00> astral: this trap card activates because he took ironhammer the giant back from you, and that is precisely why i had wanted you to take control of it in the first place. yuma: ha, sweet, that means we can get rid of furious max's curse. say goodbye to your *trump card*, *chump*.  nelson : what's this.. galaxy queen: no.. nelson : aah.  astral: now, there are *no cards protecting the galaxy queen*. nelson : rrgh. you may've broken max's cursebut, now, i'm going to break *you*. jet iron. attack number thirtynine, utopia. go, iron phoenix.  yuma: aaah. here comes defeat from above. astral: it is going to be fine. remember, there is still *one trap card* on our field. yuma: oh, right.  fb astral : the pieces are *almost in place*...  yuma: oh, *wow*, <17:00> you *did* know it would go down like this. *well, then*i activate my trap card. "vector change".. this trap lets me force your jet iron into defense mode.  esper star sparrow: this is not good. yuma: *and* it forces your monster playing defense to get its *attack mode* on.  nelson : ahh.... impossible.  nelson : now i can't attack....  nelson : mother. i havelet you down... no. this isn't over yet. you're going to *lose*, yuma.  nelson : i end my turn.  yuma: i draw. bronk: nice. all he has to do is attack galaxy queen. tori: you've got this, yuma.  astral: actually, there is *still* a risk factor. if that facedown card is a trap card that counterattacks... he might win. and *i* might... <18:00> yuma: but... this is our *only chance* to save nelson.  astral: i know. yuma : so, are you with me. astral: ...let us do it. yuma: get ready, sparrow.. 'cause i am *so* feelin' the flow.. utopia. attack galaxy queen.  yuma: go, rising sun slash.. nelson : not so fast, yuma. i activate the trap card "star sparrow forever." yuma: what is it.. is it a counter card.. nelson: this card allows me to bring star sparrow out of my graveyard with *zero attack points*. and like he always does, sparrow jumps in to protect those being attacked.  esper star sparrow: aaaaaggghhh.  <19:00> nelson's mom: nelson. no.  tori: you did it, yuma. yeah, you did it.  yuma: it wasn't a trap that could *hurt* me.... astral: so what was the point. bringing star sparrow to the field with no attack points had no strategic merit.  astral: why would he do something that was *pointless*. yuma: it *wasn't* pointless... astral: mm. yuma: he wanted to *protect her*.  yuma: he was *protecting his mom*.    astral: this memory is.... yuma: there she goes.  <20:00> nelson's mom: nelson.... oh.  nelson: mom.  nelson: i don't know what happened to me. nelson's mom: don't worry, ititit's over now.  nelson's mom: nelson, i'm sorry i've been pushing you so hard.  nelson: it's okay... nelson's mom: i... *want* you to be you. i *really do*. nelson : thanks, mom.   fb young yuma: mom.   yuma: oh. i'm gettin' all tearyeyed...  yuma: maybe now he won't feel so lonely.  yuma: so. i'm hungry. who's up for a little *spicy pizza cheeseburger* action. tori: if you knew the truth about those attacks, why didn't you tell me while we were out running around. yuma: i figured if you found out that the sparrow was *behind* all those attacks, <21:00> you woulda gotten all *sad*.  tori: uh... *awww*, you care about my feelings, don't you.  yuma: no, that's gross, i don't *care*, you're just *annoying* when you're sad, that's all. tori: *i'm* annoying, you should try talking to *you* one day, *yuma*.  tori: besides, when have you *ever* seen me sad.  yuma: are you serious.. how'bout the time you gave ashton williams that *valentine card* and he said 'no thanks'.  tori: ugh. let's just *go.*   galaxy queen: how are you able to resist my scepter's power.. sparrow: rrrggghhh... aaaaaahhh.  galaxy queen: sparrow.  galaxy queen: you did it. sparrow: mother.  yuma: oh, what a wonderful story.  yuma *right*. <22:00> astral: observation number ten. the bond between a human parent and a human child is strong... *very* strong.  yuma: huh. astral: that memory... i was remembering the moment i was *born*.  voice: your name... is *astral*.  voice: and you are being entrusted with the future of our world.  end <22:34> * special thanks to animeratio.com for the copy of this episode transcribed online. * special thanks to yugioh wikia as a source for checking cards. * special thanks to kazuki takahashi, 4kids, et al. for yugioh. zexal. last updated: may 22, 2013 i don't own yugioh zexal, at all, and this transcript is unofficial and without any permission whatsoever. please link back to me if you use my work. for more information about my transcript format, please click here. read my commentary on this episode here )
