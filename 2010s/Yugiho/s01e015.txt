'we have your friend. follow us to get her back.'  astral: yuma. wait.  <7:00>  yuma: toriiiii...  yuma: are you in here.. whoa....  yuma: it's like a *cat mansion*....  yuma: everywhere you turn, it's *cats, cats, cats*. huh.  cathy: thank you for coming, yuma.  cathy: i'm cathy catharine. yuma: *cathy catharine*. cathy: yup...  cathy: but you can just call me 'cat'. yuma: wwhatever you say... astral: i believe that i recognize this girl.  astral : she attends your school.  astral : she is often *alone*.  astral : standing off to the side.  yuma: oh yeah, you're... cathy : that's right, i'm... yuma: never seen ya before.  cathy : it's finei'm used to it. yuma: look, let's just get to the point here. what've you done with tori. cathy: 'tori, tori, tori'. is she *all* you think about.  yuma: no, i think about *lotsa* stuff, but... aaah.  whatever. just let her go. cathy : only if you defeat me in a duel. yuma: uunngghh. a *duel*..  cathy: you're not a *scaredycat*, are you.  yuma: astralya think she's got a number card. astral: if she *does* have a number, then you have to win this duel. yuma: i was planning on winning either way. let's do this.  yuma: duel disk, go. duel gazer, let's roll.  yuma: duel interface, set. computer: augmented reality vision link established.  yuma and cathy: let's duel.  cathy: my claws are sharp, and i've got *all my lives*. so *get ready*. i draw.. *first*, i'll activate the "inviting cat" card from my hand. yuma: so she's kicking things off with a *spell*. cathy: thanks to inviting cat, <9:00> i can add a stray cat to my hand. but *that's not all*. next i'm activating the continuous spell "cat meeting". yuma: a continuous spell..... astral: as long as she meets the conditions, she can activate that spell over and over. cathy: here, kitty, kitty. first i summon stray cat in attack mode.   cathy: and when i *summon* a cat monster, cat meeting activates, allowing me to summon *another* stray. after allno kitty likes to be alone.   yuma: maybe notbut those mangy alleycats only have a hundred attack points, they're totally harmless. cathy: ya *think so*. yuma: huh. cathy : you're probably right, i'm not *sure* what i was thinking, silly me. i'll just place a card facedown and *end* my turn.  cathy: well. it's *your move*, yuma. yuma : all right, thenget set to get decked. i'm summoning, achacha archer.  <10:00> yuma: and when achacha archer is successfully summoned, he can instantly dish out five hundred points of damage. achacha archer: achacha.  yuma: and there's more where that came from. astral: yuma, wait. let us talk this through. yuma: what's there to talk about. achacha archer, attack.  yuma: well, what's the holdup, big guy. just take out one a' the stray cats. that, *white one* over there. no, maybe the grey one. daaahh, i can't decide. cathy: my, my, my. i've just remembered, that when stray cat is in attack mode, you can't target *any other monster*.  yuma: so wait, buti mean, if... astral: interesting tactic. this poses a bit of a dilemma. yuma: huh. astral: *both* of her monsters are stray cats. yuma: wellyeah. *and*. astral: if you target one, then the other one will leap in and become the target of your attack. this cycle will go on and on and on. <11:00> yuma: so basically i can't attack. rrgghhthis isn't good... act 3 <11:06>  yuma: ugh, i don't know what to *do* here....  astral: yuma. i think i know a method that will get us out of this situation. yuma: stop talking.. i'm trying to concentrate.  yuma: i *know* i can do this. i know i've got what it takes to save tori.  yuma: maybe if... oh no'cause *then*... cathy : i bet you're thinking about *her*..  yuma: yeeaahh.. all right. i think i *got it*.  yuma: i've got a little flip flop  spell card action for you *and* your strays. with this card, i can now change the battle mode of one monster on the field. cathy: aaaahh.  yuma: let's go with the *white one*. all right, archeryou're up. target that *grey one*. <12:00>  achacha archer: achacha. cathy: my kitty.  astral : the stray cat's ability was *dependent* on it being in attack mode. so by forcing one of them into defense mode, yuma made the other one vulnerable. that was the suggestion *i* was going to make... perhaps it is better that he came up with that move on his own. yuma: catyou're gonna wish you hadn't messed with my friend tori. *just you wait*.. cathy: it's not *fair*. i'm standing here *right in front of you*,  and all you care about is *tori*. just forget about *her*you're supposed to be focusing on *me*.. yuma:  ahh. what is *with* you.. cathy: before you even *think* of making another move, i'm activating a spell card. *since* you destroyed my cute little stray cat, i can use the "mysterious cat transformation" spell card and summon monster cat.   yuma: whoa. that thing is *freaky*. cathy: when monster cat comes to the field, <13:00> it comes raring to destroy all your *weak* monsters.  cathy: and what makes this such a purrfect combo, is that for every monster that monster cat destroys, you get hit for eight hundred points of damage. yuma: ohhhaaaaaaaahhh.  cathy : that's what'cha get for thinking about *tori* while we're *dueling*.  yuma : yeah, sure, *lesson learned*you've got my *undivided attention*.  i end my turn. cathy : i hope ya like my kitties' tricks. 'cause monster cat's got another one. once every turn, it can rescue one stray cat from my deck or my graveyard and place it in my hand.  cathy: and *once* it's in my hand, i can summon it out to play.   astral: she has three levelone monsters on her field. are you thinking what i'm thinking. yuma: she's busting out her number card. cathy: i overlay my two stray cats and my monster cat, to build the overlay network.. <14:00>  cathy: i xyz summon, twintail cat lady.   cathy: carefulshe's a little testy.  astral: why did she not use the number card. cathy: i now activate twintail cat's special ability. once a turn, by using an overlay unit, she can increase her attack power by eight hundred points. yuma: whoa. are you serious.. you've got *two more overlay units* left, so, uh if you use both a' those, we're talkin', uh... astral: sixteenhundred more gives her thirtyfour hundred. yuma: rrggh. i woulda gotten it. cathy: it's been *fun*, dueling with you.  astral : perhaps she does *not* have a number...  yuma: i don't know who you arebut you're a great duelist. cathy : you think i'm...  you haven't seen *anything* yet. watch this.  cathy: stray cats shouldn't have to live in dirty alleys.  *meow*.. <15:00> i'm gonna activate the "cat world" field spell.  yuma: whoa. did we just *teleport*..  cathy: welcome to cat world, a world where cats can play in the grass and lie in the sun.  cathy: for them, it's a paradise. for *you*, it's a *nightmare*. act 4 <15:18> cathy: here in *cat world*, all cats gain attack points equal to their original attack points.  yuma: that cat lady just keeps getting more powerful. cathy: i've got your attention *now*, don't i. ha. go, twintail cat lady. attack yuma directly.  yuma: yaaah. i was hoping you would do that, so i could do *this*. i can activate "pixie gong" when i take a direct attack, and its sound wakes up a pixie in my deck, and summons it in attack mode. <16:00> joe the pixie, report to the front line.  cathy: awwhe's *precious*. let's see what he can *do*. your move. yuma: man. this is a great duel. you're *awesome*. cathy : yeah. ya think so. yuma: you bet. cathy : it's just... it's just so nice to hear you say that, because well... in the real world, there's this *boy*... he doesn't even know i *exist*. we see each other all the time, but, he just *looks right through me*. yuma: this guy sounds like kind of a jerk. cathy: i *tried* playing all sorts of little tricks on him, just to get 'im to *say* something to me, but it didn't work. i'm just so shy. i wish i could walk right up to him and tell him that i like him. yuma: you should. cathy: huh. yuma: he'll never know how you feel if you keep it to yourself. just *go for it*. put it out there for the world to see. cathy : you're right, yuma.  cathy: i'm *gonna* do it. i'm gonna go for it. <17:00> okay, here goes. yuma, i think you're reallyyuma : okay, it's my turn. i draw. cathy : ooh. yuma: it's time to bring out acorno. see, by sending pinecono to my graveyard, i can bring this little guy to the field.  yuma: and now, pinecono's special ability can activate. when he gets sent to the graveyard, i can summon him *straight out*.  cathy: hang on a second, don'tyuma: all righty. here we go. now *i* can xyzsummon *too*. i overlay my three levelone monsters in order to build the overlay network.  yuma: say hello to baby tiragon.  yuma: for my next move, i'll be summoninggagaga magician.  yuma: i activate gagaga magician's special ability, so now he's a levelone. <18:00>and next, i activate baby tiragon's abilityby using one overlay unit, baby tiragon empowers a levelone monster to attack you directly.  cathy: yuma, wait, i wanted to say thatyuma: gagaga magician, attack. go, gagaga magic.  cathy: aaaaaaahhhh. yuma: i'm on a *roll*. baby tiragon, attack twintailed cat lady.  astral: do *what*. it does not have enough attack points. yuma: i got that covereddon't you worry.
