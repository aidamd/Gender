  act 1 <2:41>  kaze: roku. once i defeat this pathetic student of yours...  kaze: i will *truly* be the master of this duel sanctuary, and the legendary deck you hold so dear will be mine. and then i will be unstoppable..  yuma: uggghhh. <3:00> *look*, samuraiguy, i don't even know what this legendary deck *is*. all i know is that master roku doesn't want you to have itso you're not gonna *get* it.  kaze: hmph. you would be wise to rethink this duel and quit *now*. trust me. do not stand in my way. for if you doi will show no mercy. and you will feel my wrath..  bronk: show 'im what you're made of, yuma. tori : this guy was your student. was he, like, any *good*. roku: he was the best student i've ever had, until the darkness filled his heart and corrupted his spirit. yuma: bring it on, ya big *windbag*. i draw.. now if i lower dododo warrior's attack points by five hundred, i can summon it to the field.   kaze: you have no idea what you're doing, do you. if you had tributed gagaga magician to summon dododo warrior, <4:00> it would've come to the field with more attack points than my blade armor ninja. bronk: why would yuma keep 'is magician if it means making dododo warrior weaker. astral: yuma... did you do that *just to protect your magician*. yuma: you got a problem with that..  astral: i do not.  yuma: all rightnext up, i activate the "fullforce strike" spell card from my hand. when our monsters battle, neither one of us takes damage, but your monster will be destroyed.  yuma: now i'm gonna attack your blade armor ninja with dododo warrior. go, dododo axe.  kaze: i activate my trap"armor ninjitsu art of freezing".  kaze: when there's a ninja on my field, this trap not only stops your monster's attack, but it binds your socalled *friend* so that it can't change battle mode.  yuma: rrrgghhh... astral: that is not good. <5:00> kaze: your efforts to stop me are in vain. you're going to fall and roku's legendary deck will be mine.  act 2 <5:08>  yuma: you might have my back against the wall, but you're not gonna beat me *or* get master roku's legendary deck. i place one card facedown and *end my turn*. kaze: in that casei draw. i activate the spell, "spy attack". by sending one monster from my hand to the graveyard, i gain the ability to look at a facedown card on your field. aqua armor ninja, sneak into the enemy's domain and reveal his tactics.   yuma: aaaarrrggghhh. astral: unlike you, kaze seems to have *no problem* sacrificing his monsters. kaze: now *show me your card*.  kaze: interesting. roku: careful, boy. grandma: did you get yuma to do all this *cleaning*, roku. i'm impressed. <6:00> i can't even get him to straighten up his room.  roku: *haru*. kari: huh. roku: hahaha. long time, no see.  tori: hey there, kari. kari: i can't believe i'm seeing what i'm seeing. *yuma*.. yuma: ahh. *kari*. kari: didn't we have a little talk about you *dueling*..  what did i say.. roku: put your knuckles away. kari: huh. roku: you cannot stop yuma from being who he *is*, any more than you can stop the wind from blowing.  roku: and as a growing duelist, your brother *needs* your support. yuma: uhyeah. what he said. astral: you must remain focused, yuma. yuma: on what. kaze: how nice of your family to gather like this. they're just in time to watch you suffera bitter defeat. blade armor ninja, attack gagaga magician. go, electromagnetic sword slice.  yuma: aaaaahh. nnngghh...  kaze: swift like a hummingbird, blade armor ninja whirls around as i use its overlay unit to attack *again*. <7:00> bid farewell to your friend dododo warrior.  kaze: thanks to my spy attack, i know that your facedown card is "gagagaback", which can resurrect your monsters in exchange for six hundred lifepoints each. *use it*, little gnat. save your precious friends. bronk: don't do it, yuma. those monsters aren't worth six hundred lifepoints, not when you're already down so low. tori : ...bronk's right... kaze: now let's *really* test the limits of your foolish devotion. i reveal the "armor ninjitsu art of rust mist" trap card. as long as i have a ninja in play, the attack points of every monster you summon is  sliced in half. yuma: ugh. kaze: heheheh, are you still willing to do whatever it takes to honor your little friends, even when they're rendered weak and useless. yuma: rrrrgghhh. astral: do not let this development stop you from following through, yuma. trust your instincts, and listen to your heart. yuma: huh... astral: he is hoping to shatter your resolve, <8:00> by proving that everyone is willing to abandon their friends to save themselves. *i* think he is wrong. yuma: he *is* wrong. i'm activating the "gagagaback" spell card. when gagaga magician is destroyed in battle, this card can bring it back along with its friends. both it *and dododo warrior* return to the field.   yuma: and now the bummer parti take six hundred points of damage for each one of 'em. ggggghhhh...aaaaaahhh.  kari: oh no. bronk: he's down to three hundred lifepoints. tori: *now* what.  kaze: you may have revived your fallen monsters, but now the power of my trap rust mist slices their attack points in half.  kaze: *your move*, little gnat. yuma: rrrrgghh... kaze: are you feeling foolish yet. your monsters have been weakened <9:00> and you're hanging on by a *very thin thread*. hmhmhmthe bond you have with your monsters has made you weak. yuma: i think i've got you figured out.  yuma: the reason you keep saying that friendship makes you weakis simple. you don't *have* any friends, *do ya*. kaze: why would i bother relying on anyone other than myselfi'm strong enough to stand on my own. i'm certainly not befriending any of my *monsters*.  kaze: the old man's teachings are *nonsense*.  kaze: dueling is about controlling your monsters and bending them to do your will. yuma: you're wrong. that is *not* what dueling is about. kaze: you talk a big talk, like you're full of fire... but you're nothing more than a candle in the wind, desperately trying to hold on. soon you will be extinguished.  yuma: *bring it on.*  it's my turn. i draw.  ha. all rightget ready. <10:00> 'cause i'm activating the "gagagabolt" spell card. with gagaga magician on my field, it destroys one of your cards. it's been nice knowin' ya, blade armor ninja. buhbye.  kaze: why you little.. yuma: and now gagaga magician can attack you directly.  yuma: and *while* we're at it, dododo warrior can attack you directly too.  kaze: aghi don't think so. i activate aqua armor's ability from the graveyard. by banishing this card it stops your monster's attack. yuma: that's what *you* think. see, when dododo warrior attacks, it cancels out all your spells, traps, and monster effects. kaze: what.. yuma: with rust mist and aqua's effects outta the picture, there's *nothing* standing in dododo warrior's way.  <11:00> yuma: now, attack. dododo warrior: dododo axe.  yuma: yahahaaa.. suddenly, everything's comin' up *yuma*.  yuma: ahh. nice one, huh. astral : mm. yuma : you talk a lotta trash and act like friendship is for losers. but i *believed* in my friends and they came through for me. i didn't toss them aside just to gain a slight advantage. *roku is right*you have to respect your monsters.  kaze: whateverso you lucked out this time. you think that proves something. mark my words, little gnatone day you'll look around, and your friends're gonna be *gone*. it's just gonna be *you all alone*, with no one to rely on, and you're gonna be scared. and you're gonna wish you hadn't been so foolish as to depend on someone else.  kaze: and now, *i* draw. i activate a spell card. <12:00>  kaze: the power of this spell destroys every ninjitsu art on my field. yuma: why would you go and get rid of your own traps like that. kaze: because doing so allows me to draw two new cards from my deck.  yuma: just what are you up to. kaze: when you have monsters on the field but i don't, i can summon earth armor ninja to mine.   yuma: ugh.... astral: his strategy worries me. kaze: next, i activate the "armor ninjitsu art of revival" spell card. this allows me to summon one ninja from my graveyard. so say hello to flame armor ninja.  kaze: and when it is successfully summoned, its level increases by one. hahaha.  astral: lookhis handhe must have a number card. yuma: no way. <13:00> kaze: you tried hard, boy, but now, you are finished.. i'm going to crush you. i overlay earth armor ninja, and flame armor ninja.  kaze: with these two monsters i build the overlay network.  kaze: i xyz summonnumber twelve. crimson shadow armor ninja.   yuma: uhhh... *gulp*. act 3 <13:38>  kaze: the crimson shadow has shown me that true power's about *rage and might*. strength above *everything*. yuma: ohh, *man*. ugh.... i don't know if i have enough left *in* me to take on a number... roku : so *this* is the monster that's been feeding off of kaze's anger. <14:00> kari: now what.  kaze: prepare to crumble in the wake of true power. crimson shadow, attack gagaga magician. yuma: i'm *toast*... astral: not if you play your trap card. yuma: oh yeahright. my "guts guard" trap card can force crimson shadow to attack dododo warrior, instead of gagaga magician. and it also protects dododo warrior from being destroyed in battle.  kaze: heheh, now you finally know what true power looks like.  yuma: ugh. saved by the trap. but, next turn, if i don't manage to take 'im out... bronk: pull yaself togetha', yuma. grandma: what that boy needs right now is a hearty bit of duel fuel. tori: huh. grandma: nobody can win on an empty stomachright, tori.  tori: i'm on it.  bronk: *tori*. kaze: what's wrong<15:00> no peppy line about *hugs and sunshine*.. no rousing speech about chumming it up with your monsters..  astral: yuma, do not let your doubt overtake you. remember that you are *not alone*. you have got your friends with you. yuma: hah....  fb roku: when you learn to make that fear your own, and when you master how to tame it, *only then* will you truly be able to move a monster.  yuma: 'to move a monster'....  astral: i understand that when your back is to the wall, you may feel outnumbered. but you are not. when you have friends you are *never* alone.  astral: you can do it. yuma: you guys up for this.  yuma: you're right, astral. no matter *what* we're up against, we're *all in it together*. it's time to take a stand with my friends, and kick some ninja *butt*.  <16:00>  tori: yuma, *catch*. yuma: huh.  tori: *duel fuel*.  yuma: yeah. you *rock*, tori.  yuma: nowi'm totally feelin' the flow. it's my turni draw.  yeah.. that's what i'm talkin' about. get ready, 'cause you're about to get *yuma'd*. my "decrease" spell card lowers my monster's level by two. which means i can change dododo warrior from a levelsix to a levelfour. which means i can overlay gagaga magician *and* dododo warrior.  yuma: which means i can build the overlay network.  yuma: which *means*, i can xyz summon.  yuma: here comes number thirtynine, utopia..  yuma: yes. astral: everything is set up. <17:00> you can *do this*, yuma. yuma: yep. utopia, take out crimson shadow armor ninja. go, rising sun slash..  yuma: how d'ya like *that*.  kaze: you *worm*. you're nothing. you will not defeat me like this. by using one overlay unit, crimson shadow returns to the field.  yuma: hm. good, 'cause now i get to throw down the "revenge attack" spell. astral: so when your monster attacks but fails to destroy its opponent in battle, revenge attack activates and increases its power. yuma: so utopia gains a thousand attack points *and* the ability to attack again. kaze: it *what*.. <18:00>    tori: huh. bronk: where's this *light* comin' from.  roku: i'd always wanted a skylight, but this is....  astral: this is where we win the duel. yuma: utopia. astral and yuma : attack. with rising sun slash.  kaze: this can't be.. aaaaaaaaagggghhhhh...  act 4 <18:42>  kaze: this can't be.. aaaaaaaaagggghhhhh...  tori and bronk: yuma. yuma: not bad, huh, guys.  grandma: well i dare say something seems to have lifted yuma's dueling spirits.  he's got that *bounce* in his voice again.  *i can't help but wonder* who we have to thank for that.  roku: i simply showed yuma the path. he's the one who actually took the steps. bronk : c'mon, it was *close*.  yuma: well, i mean, yeah, it was *close*... bronk: any closer, and *you'd* be the one on the floor.  yuma: not funny. kaze: rrrggghh.  yuma: wah.  kaze: aaaaaaahhhh... tori: stop, yuma.. bronk: what're you doing.. roku: ah.... <20:00> tori: you could get hurt..  kaze: *get outta the way*. yuma: i dunno *what* you're so angry at, but whatever it is, slicing this statue in two isn't gonna make it better.  yuma: master roku poured his heart and soul into making this statue. you don't get to destroy it just 'cause you're having a bad day.   kaze : i was betrayed once by my friends. i had nowhere to turn.  kaze : so i came to roku, seeking a new direction.  kaze : he spoke about respecting my monsters, and trusting them. but...   kaze: i lashed out in anger....  kaze: i just... i *can't do it*. after what i went through... i just can't. i don't know how to trust... anyone.  <21:00> roku: you can *still learn how*, my boy. it is never too late for that.  kaze: master.   roku: kaze is going to stay here and continue his training. yuma: ha. maybe i'll swing by sometime and we can duel, and then you can teach me how to wield that *sword* like a true master.  kaze: we'll see. yuma: hahahahahahauuh.  kari: so you were dueling behind my back. yuma: eheh, haha...  kari: i'm just kiddingya little dweeb..  kari: for real. *you can duel whenever you want to*, yuma. yuma: aaaahhhuh. ... yeah... didja hear that, bronk. i'm a free man.  roku: i want you to have this deck, yuma. this is the sanctuary's legendary deck. i think you and the monsters in here will get along splendidly. yuma: ...really. roku: *really*.  yuma: haha. <22:00>  bronk: that's *so awesome*, buddy. you can use those to strengthen up your deck for the world duel carnival. yuma: aw, yeah.. roku: ooh. are you planning on entering a *duel tournament*. yuma: uhhuh. me and my monsters are gonna *rock it*. isn't that right, astral.  yuma: uhastral.  astral: it seems yuma has gotten his confidence back. that is a good thing. if we are to defeat kite, we must *both* believe we can win... i must work on that. end <22:37> * special thanks to animeratio.com and toonzaki.com for the copies of this episode transcribed online. *
