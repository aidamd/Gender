  act 1 <<1:25   yuma: we have to stop that number.  astral: it will be difficult.  shark : *yuma*...  bronk: i wouldn't wanna bump into *that* thing at night. flip: *or* in the *day*. mr. heartland: oh, wow..  that monster has *me* written *all over it*.  dr. faker: hahahahaha. it's *magnificent*.. i *must have it*..  vetrix: i *know you*, faker. you're planning to seize control of shark drake and its power. but you don't realize *i* have plans, *too*. shark: show no mercy, shark drake. destroy gogogo ghost with deep sea destruction.  yuma: aaaaaahhhhh..  astral: he will keep attacking.  yuma: i know.  shark: i activate shark drake's special ability.. by using an overlay unit, when it destroys a monster, shark drake has the power to summon it right back again, with one thousand less attack points. so gogogo ghost is *comin' back*, and i'm gonna take it out.  bronk: looks like shark's doubledippin' on his attack.  tori: mmh. yuma better find a way to stop 'im, quick. shark: you only have nine hundred lifepoints left. yuma: mmgh. shark: once i finish off your gogogo ghost, *you're* finished, too. *get it done*, shark drake. finish off yuma *and* his monster.   flip : that finished 'im off for *sure*. tori: i... can't believe it....  shark: hmhmhmhm... what's this..  bronk: yuma took his monsters and made a switcharoo. tori: great move. he still has a chance to pull this out. shark: how were you able to bring out gogogo golem.. yuma: i had to play my cards *just right*.  yuma : ya see, gogogo ghost's special ability let me summon gogogo golem from my graveyard. when that happened, gogogo ghost got moved into defense mode. even though it was destroyed by shark drake, i was protected and didn't take any damage.  shark: hmph. so *that's* how you survived. but i'll defeat you on my *next* turn. bronk: most impressive, yuma. kazwell: that was *genius*. flip : of course, it was probably astral's idea. tori: please, yuma*hang in there*. vetrix: not bad. but *still not good enough*. dr. faker: reginald has completely reversed the course of this duel. yuma will need to summon his most powerful number to survivewhich meansi'll be able to see utopia's powers.. astral: listen, yuma. you *must find a way to summon utopia*. it is our *only hope* now. yuma: i was thinkin' the same thing. but i only have *golem* on my field. i need to draw another levelfour monster in order to summon utopia. okay, here goesi draw.  yuma: aw. no luck. it's not a monster card. astral: *patience*, yuma... yuma: *patience*.. i don't have the patience to be patient.. i've gotta save shark before it's too late.  come on, shark. snap out of it. vetrix is controlling your mind, but i know you can break free if you just think back to all the duels you and i fought together. shark: what're you *talking* about..  yuma : don'tcha remember our first duel. we battled for both bronk's deck and mineit was intense.  yuma : and then there was the time we *teamed up* to duel, and you gave me a card after we won.  fb shark: i'm outta here.  fb yuma: wait up. your "armored xyz"don't you want it back. fb shark: nah. keep it. fb yuma: you sure. fb shark: yeah...  you can use all the help you can *get*. fb yuma : *i'm* the one who helped *you*.  fb shark: later.  yuma: it meant a lot to me when you gave me that card. 'cause i felt like we were *really starting to connect*.  yuma: and when kite tried to take my golden key...  yuma : you dueled him to protect it. think back, shark. try to remember.   yuma: all those duels helped me see who the *true you* is, sharkand that person is my friend.  shark: *no*. i'm *not*. yuma: huh..  shark: i don't wanna be friends with *anyone*, yuma. especially not with someone like *you*.  shark: the one thing i care about is getting revenge. you're gonna pay for hurting my sister..  shark: but i've had *enough* chitchat for one day. we're wasting time here. i came here to duel, not to have a *conversation*. hurry up, and make your move.. yuma: rrrghh. all right then. i'll have to let my *dueling* speak for me. first i'm changing gogogo golem from defense to attack mode. and then, i'll pump up its power with the spell "golden form".  yuma: when my gogogo golem switches from defense to attack mode, this spell *doubles* its attack points until my next turn. mr. heartland: whoa. break out those *sunglasses*, folks. that is the *glitziest* golem i've ever seen. bronk: but even if its powered up, it's still not a number, so it can't take out shark drake. kazwell: yeah, so why did yuma *use* the spell. astral: yuma... yuma: i know what i'm doing. even though i can't destroy shark's number, my attack will *still pack a punch*. maybe the impact will be enough to bring shark back to his senses. now, gogogo golem. attack shark drake. gogogo gust..  shark: uuuaaaggghhhhuugh.  yuma: shark. snap out of it. come on, shark.  shark: gghh... mr. heartland: *very* clever. yuma just threw shark a *curve* and got a solid *strike*. he didn't even *scratch* shark's numberbut suddenly both duelists are down to nine hundred lifepoints.  shark: you can't take down my number. so you're trying to drain my *lifepoints instead*.  only it's *too late*. yuma: rrggh.  yuma: wellwe'll *see about that*, shark. take your turn. shark : if you insist. i draw. ...it's time. i just wish my sister were here to see this moment.  shark: but she *can't be*thanks to *you*.. aaaaaagggghhhhhhh....  shark: aaaaaaaagggghhhhhh....  that's cool. whoa. ...something *wrong* with him. shark: nowgo.. by combining shark drake with its own overlay units, it can further evolve itself. go, chaos xyz evolution.  shark: behold the dreaded chaos number thirtytwo. shark drake veiss.    mr. heartland: oh. what *is* that.... bronk: that thing doesn't look friendly. tori: oh no. vetrix: hmhmhmhmhmhmhmhm... yuma: how can we stop that thing.. astral: i am not sure if we can.  vetrix: hahahahahahahaha. act 2 <<8:56  yuma: shark summoned his *chaos number*... astral: the chances of us winning this duel do not appear to be promising. shark: at last. now, shark drake veiss. use your special ability. it uses an overlay unit to banish a shark monster from my graveyard. g'bye, spear shark. now its sixteen hundred attack points get subtracted from gogogo golem.  astral: you *must* stop this. yuma: i will. by activating my "power change barrier" trap.  yuma: now gogogo's attack points get reduced by six hundred. it's a small price to pay'cause the trap *cancels out* shark drake veiss's special ability. cathy : nice defense. kazwell: but shark drake veiss has *four* overlay units, so yuma's *still* in trouble. shark: i'll *do it all over again*, yuma. i use an overlay unit to banish double shark so i can weaken *your* monster. double shark, *get that golem*. yuma: that's not gonna happen as long as i keep activating my power change barrier.  yuma: shark drake veiss's special ability is *negated again*.  shark: i still have one overlay unit left, so i can strike again. this time, i banish *shark drake* from my graveyard.  shark: this means *your* gogogo golem will lose twentyeight *hundred* attack points.  yuma: not yet. i still have my trap.  shark: so what. my shark drake veiss has one thousand more attack points than your *feeble golem*. this next strike will end the duel. attack.. shark drake veiss..  yuma: rrgghh. shark: chaos stream..  yuma: i activate my trap, "half unbreak". it saves gogogo golem from destruction.  yuma: and the damage i take is cut in half. rrrrgghhh...   tori: oh no.. shark: you've survived everything i've thrown at you... but i saved the best for last.  shark: on my next turn you're gonna lose. i'm putting one card facedownyour move.  vetrix : if yuma was wise, he'd *stay down*. he doesn't have a *chance*. vetrix: it's over. the card that i gave shark...  vetrix : as a present is *too powerful*.  vetrix : yuma will be finished *once and for all*.  vetrix: ahahahahahahahahaha.  astral: we are down to four hundred lifepoints. this is our last chance. yuma: i know. i'm counting on my deck to help me *win* this turn. i gotta drawthe *perfect card*. i'm feelin' the flow... hah..  yuma: i did it. i summon gagaga magician.  yuma: i overlay my levelfour gagaga magician and gogogo golem.  yuma: with these two monsters, i build the overlay network, and xyz summon number thirtynine, utopia.   shark: nice work. except your utopia only has twentyfive hundred attack points, so it isn't strong enough to overpower my chaos number.  shark: if utopia tries to attack, it's the one that's gonna get destroyed. hmhmhmhm, hahaha, hahahahahayuma: that's not true.  yuma: utopia *will* survive... and so will your chaos number. shark: what.. yuma: i'm fighting this duel to save you. but that doesn't mean i don't want to win. it's important that i become the world duel carnival champion, so i can stop doctor faker *and* vetrix. but it's also important to free you from the control vetrix has on your mind. i'll do whatever it takes to help my friends. especially one of my best friends*you*..  shark: huh.. yuma: this will work. okay utopia, attack shark drake veiss.. rising sun slash.  shark: unh.  instead of trying the *same old strategy*, you should use a little imagination. *that's why you're always a failure*.. go, chaos stream..  yuma: i'll use an overlay unit to activateutopia's special ability. it can stop its own attack.  shark: hang onutopia stopped its own attack. astral: are you ready. yuma: i am.  yuma: i'm activating my trap "rivals unite" right now. since utopia stopped its attack, this card equips onto your monsterand i get to take control of it.  shark: no. you can't. yuma: leave shark at once.. hear that, shark drake veiss.. i order you to enter *my soul instead*..  act 3 <<14:15  yuma: shark drake veiss. leave shark and enter *my* soul..  yuma: aaagghhnnnnnnnnaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh...  shark: ughaaaaaaaaggghhhhh..  yuma: you're free from the number. now try to remember the truth about the past.  shark: ughaaaaaaagggghhhhhh  fb shark: you're a good duelist... i'll see ya 'round.  fb yuma: ah, come on. i thought we were *friends*.  fb yuma: don't go. fb shark: yuma, you an' i're *finished*, so don't you ever come botherin' me again.  fb yuma: i'm not gonna step aside and let you *throw your life away*, shark.  fb yuma: you're my *friend*, shark. and i don't wanna see you destroy yourself with hate.   shark : i finally remember, yuma.  shark : you're not the one responsible for what happened to my sister.   shark : *vetrix* was behind everything.  shark : *he's* the one who's guilty..   shark: it was him. *he* planted that number in my soul and made me forget.  yuma: aaaggghhh.  shark: yuma.  yuma: uuuuuaaaggghhhhh. shark: no. yuma. vetrix: ahahahahaha.  vetrix: it's too late for yuma. soon his *soul* will be *completely consumed* by shark drake veiss.  yuma: ggggghhhhhhh.. shark: yuma.. vetrix: if he *truly is* your friend... you'll want to help him, of course. yuma: uuuuaaaaaahhhhhhhhh...  shark: what can i do..  vetrix: ah. so you *remember*. you just have to use the trap card i gave you... "heraldry catastrophe".  vetrix : don't worry, yuma. shark will save you. yuma: vetrix. vetrix: since you took control of shark drake veiss, shark can now activate his facedown card. it is a trap called heraldry catastrophe.  vetrix: since you now *control* shark's monster, this trap *destroys it*, along with all your monsters that have equal or fewer attack points. so that means that shark drake veiss and your utopia will both be wiped out. eheheheheh. astral: wiped out. yuma: no way. vetrix: oh, and you'll also take damage equal to those monsters' attack points. that's a total of *fiftythree hundred* points. so sharkit's a winwin for you. you free yuma from shark drake veiss's control, and you win the duel.  vetrix: hmhmhm. am i *brilliant*, or what. i expected yuma to take over your monster, and that's why i *gave you* the trap. your victory is guaranteed. hahahahahahahaha.  yuma: if utopia gets destroyed, astral's a goner too. ugh, i have to *think*. there must be *something* i can do...  yuma: huh.. of course, traplin. all i have to do is *destroy a trap card on my field* to summon it. that means i can get rid of rivals unite. astral: indeed. shark drake veiss will return to shark, plus utopia and i will be saved. shark will once again be controlled by that number...  and ultimately by *vetrix*. yuma: ...so then i have to *choose*, between saving you or saving shark.. i can't.  yuma: ugh. uuuuaaaaggghhhh.  yuma: aaaaaaaaggghhhhh.... shark: yuma..  vetrix: quickuse that trap card. it's the only way you can help yuma. *every second you hesitate*, that chaos number tightens its grip on yuma's soul. you must activate heraldry catastrophe before it's too late. it will save your friend and assure your victory.  yuma: uuuhuughhh, uuuuhhuggghhhh... astral : yuma. yuma: i can't do it.... i can't choose between you. you and shark are my friendsi care about what happens to both of you, and i don't wanna see either of you hurt. shark: yuma.....  shark : waitthere's that card i put facedown at the start a' the duel... that's *it*..  i activate a spell"underwater snow prison". i'll use it to put shark drake veiss on iceand *banish 'im*.  act 4 <<18:30 shark: i activate a spell"underwater snow prison". i'll use it to put shark drake veiss on iceand *banish 'im*.  shark: using this spell has a price. i take one thousand points of damage.  shark: aaahhh. yuma: shark. no..   mr. heartland: i... can't believe it. yuma tsukumo wins the duel.  yuma: shark, are you okay.. shark. please answer. tell me you're okay.  shark: i'm fine. you saved me. my soul could've been lost *forever*... but you never gave up on our friendship. vetrix tried to use me to hurt you and astral... but in the end... i never gave up on our friendship, either. just promise me this. you'll defeat vetrix for good.  vetrix: defeat *me*.. for good.. i'll teach that twerp yuma not to meddle with my plans...  vetrix: shark failed his mission. but that won't make *any difference*. after i defeat kite, i'll eliminate yuma tsukumo once and for all..  astral: shark lost the duel to *save us*. yuma: i know... when it was all on the line... shark proved that he's a true friend. astral : he asked one thing in return, though. yuma: yeah. and if i *do* face vetrix in the finals, i won't let shark down. i'll win it all and highfive the sky..  end <<20:14 * special thanks to animeratio.com for the copy of this episode transcribed online. * special thanks to yugioh wikia as a source for checking cards. * special thanks to kazuki takahashi, 4kids, et al. for yugioh. zexal. last updated: june 20, 2013 i don't own yugioh zexal, at all, and this transcript is unofficial and without any permission whatsoever. please link back to me if you use my work. for more information about my transcript format, please click here. read my blog post on this episode here  )
