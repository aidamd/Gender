books, and *pizza*...  nelson : i'm not some monsterbusting freedomfighter.  nelson : i mean, i can't even talk to *girls* without getting nervous....  nelson : but it's all about keeping the *fans*

*know* that, mom. but uh... mom: but *nothing*.  mom: if people found out what kind of a kid you really are, the illusion of the sparrow would be *shattered*. and *it's not* just about you..  mom:

...i can't. the sparrow is more important than i am. nelson andrews doesn't matter. yuma: huh.  yuma: nelson. aw...  yuma: i never knew being a tv star was so hard. astral: i am not following this. why was the sparrow calling himself a 'nelson'. yuma: there's no such thing as the sparrow. i told you, he's *made up*. astral: huh. yuma: somebody somewhere just *thought 'im up*. that's how tv *works*, astral, it's all just *pretend*. astral: you mean that someone was attempting to trick me. yuma: no one was trying to trick you, it's just *entertainment*. astral : so then... he *doesn't know anything*.... <10:00> yuma : i've been *saying* that but you haven't been listening.  astral: i... see now. yuma: hold onwhat's wrong. what's with the sad face. you kinda look like you're feeling *bummed out* all of a sudden. astral: what is feeling 'bummed out'. yuma: bummed out is when you go to the candy shop and they're all out of your favorite chocolate bar. astral: i understand.... so *nelson* is bummed out, too. yuma: huh.  astral: did you not hear the last thing he said.  fb nelson: nelson andrews doesn't matter.    nelson: huh. what's that. it's a *card*.  deep voice: yeees, nelson... let the number take hold...  act 2 <11:08>  uh, hey man. nice cape. sparrow: disregarding this city's littering laws.. i *know you*. you're one of the dark emperor's minions, *aren't* you. the what.  sparrow: come ontime for me to take out the trash. nngghaah.  hey. you. get outta the road.  uhh... sparrow: only a follower of the dark emperor furious max would try to harm an innocent creature. it's too bad *you* don't have nine lives.  <12:00> aaaaahh.   ohhh.  aauugghh.   newscaster : multiple eyewitnesses report that the assailant was none other than the sparrow, the hero of the popular tv series.  newscaster : we go now to a press conference being held by the show's producers. nelson's mom : our sparrow would never do such things. he stands for honor, truth, and justice. tori: this is *awful*. someone's trying to make the sparrow look bad.  yuma: what're we *doing* out here, tori. tori: we're *out here* to prove the sparrow's innocence. tying *random people* up and flipping over cars. the sparrow would *never* do stuff like that. yuma: yeah, you're right about that. he'd be way too afraid. tori: way too *what*.. yuma: uhh, way too, uh, too awesome. heeeelp. yuma and tori: huh..  tori: that way. yuma: let's go.  tori: are you okay, sir. <13:00> some oddball wearin' a cape came outta nowhere. astral: over there.  yuma: huh. hey you, stop.  yuma: hold it right there.  yuma: it *is* you. nelson : yuma. just stay away from me.  tori: where is he. yuma: ah.. i dunno. he got away from us.  yuma: that was definitely nelson behind that mask. why is he *doing* all this. it just doesn't seem like the kid i met the other day. astral: the answer is out there. find it. yuma: and how do i do *that*. i'm all ears. astral: you made a promise to nelson when you met. you should fulfill that promise. yuma: huh. astral: you told nelson that you would duel him. that's exactly what you should do. a duel can bring out someone's inner strength, no matter how deeply it is buried. <14:00>  fb nelson: nelson andrews doesn't matter.   yuma: yeahlet's do this.  yuma: aaaaand, *action*.  nelson: huh.  yuma: nelson. why are you going around and attacking people.  nelson: what are you doing here. i thought i told you to stay away. yuma: what're you doing running around dressing up and acting like the sparrow.. nelson: i have to fulfill my duty to the galaxy queen. yuma: your mom. nelson: i swore to defeat the dark emperor furious max and his minions. yuma: nelson...  nelson: why do you keep calling me by that name. for i am known in every corner of the universe asthe sparrow.  nelson : now as for you. why have you come here. has the dark emperor managed to sink his claws into *you* as well.   fb nelson's mom: think about how many people *depend* on you being the sparrow.  yuma: aw, man. you're *really* letting all this get to you. astral: what is going on. all what. yuma: nelson has started thinking that he's *actually the sparrow*. astral: what. so you are saying, he's stuck in the fantasy t.v. world of makebelieve and pretend. yuma: well, *yeah*, listen to 'im. he must've snapped under all the pressure or something.  nelson : hahahahaha. the world is waiting for me to deliver justice far and wide. yuma: snap out of it, nelson. nelson : yuma. i didn't want it to come to this. alas, if you're with the dark emperorthen i have no choice but to battle you. yuma: all right... bring it on. you wanna battle. <16:00> i challenge you to a duel.  nelson : i accept your challenge.  yuma: duel disk, go..  yuma: duel gazer, let's roll. computer: augmented reality vision link established.  yuma: get set to get decked. yah. you wanna piece a' me. well i'm gonna serve ya the whole *pie*. yuma and nelson: let's duel.  act 4 <16:29>  nelson : you're going'ta *lose*, yuma. heheheheheh.... astral: do you see. yuma: he's got a number card, right. astral: it must be amplifying the pressure that he feels to be the sparrow. yuma : so once again it's *your* fault that trouble is popping up. nelson : right, let's do this. i draw. i summon beast warrior puma. <17:00>   astral: i have seen him in action. not only is he incredibly acrobatic, he is a rather gifted swordsman. nelson: i end my turn by playing one card facedown. yuma : puma, meet *yuma*. i draw. i summon gogogo golem.   nelson : i suppose you're going to send that lumbering *brute* in to attack puma. yuma: you took the words right outta my mouth. gogogo gust. nelson : i can't believe it. you walked right into my trap.  nelson : since i have three copies of triplestar trion in my hand, i can activate trion barrier, and force your golem into defense mode.  nelson : and then, i can summon my three triplestar trions to the field.   yuma: three cards at once.. i play one card facedown. that's it. nelson : then it's *my* turn. i draw. first, i'm releasing two of my trions, so that i can tributesummon. esper star sparrow is ready to crash this party.   yuma: astral, what's tributesummoning.. astral: to summon highlevel, powerful monsters, you must *tribute* other monsters.  astral: nelson had to tribute *two* monsters, in order to summon his esper star sparrow. nelson : and nowi'll activate my trion's special ability. which means i can restack my field by bringing back the other two trions that are in my graveyard. go, lavish return. welcome back, you two.  <19:00> nelson : next, i'm activating "space ration" from my hand. i can activate this card's power because esper star sparrow is on my field. thanks to its effect, i can draw *two cards* from my deck. and with *that* done, i overlay my three levelone trions. with these three monsters, i build the overlay network.  nelson : i xyz summon. kneel before number eightythreegalaxy queen.   yuma: you just summoned your *mom*. astral: the galaxy queen.... <20:00> yuma: huh. astral: she was revered as a good and noble leader, butnelson : i equip the galaxy queen with "furious max's curse". hah. while under this spell's influence, the galaxy queen can't be destroyed in *any* situation. and now, i use one overlay unit to activate the galaxy queen's special ability.  nelson : the galaxy queen can grant every monster on my field immortality until my next turn. and, allow them to deal damage even if *your* monster is in defense mode. galaxy queen: come. follow me and gain the ultimate power.  yuma: so this is all kinds a' bad news for me, isn't it. astral: correct. if gogogo golem is attacked, i am afraid it will *not* be very pleasant. your lifepoints will be damaged. nelson : beast warrior puma. attack. go, dark slash.  <21:00> yuma: since gogogo golem is in defense mode, it can avoid being destroyed in a battle once a turn. nelson : perhaps so, but your lifepoints still take damage. yuma: rrrrrggghhh.  nelson : and now, to finish what puma started. go, star sparrow. attack.  nelson : *hope you enjoy* his megapunch surprise.  nelson : don't you *see*. you can't win.  i am the sparrow. i have journeyed through time and space to fight the forces of evil, and restore justice to the galaxy.  yuma: well ya know what. i've journeyed from my bedroom to restore you to your true selfand i'm not about to back down.  end <21:52> * special thanks to animeratio.com for the copy of this episode transcribed online. * special thanks to yugioh wikia as a source for checking
