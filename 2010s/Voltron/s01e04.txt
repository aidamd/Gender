  the monster fell from the sky. it was an epic battle, but voltron was victorious. no. i said, "voltron was victorious."   thank you, your majesty, for that wonderful production. it saddens me that we must leave tomorrow, but we must continue our battle with zarkon and spread peace throughout the universe. your highness please accept this gift. this will allow you to contact us anytime you need help. arus will be the first planet in the voltron alliance. hoorah.   we ought to get something like that. like what. you know, like, a cheer. like, a team cheer that we do. mmhmm. yeah, okay. how about, uh "i say vol" and you say "tron. " vol. uh voltron. no. no, no, no. the cheer includes the instructions. i say "vol" and you say voltron. we'll work on it. coran, what is this. oh, this is nunvill, the nectar of the gods. it tastes like hot dog water and feet. yeah, makes a wonderful hair tonic as well.  not feeling well. try some nunvill. settles the stomach and brightens your smile. i'm not sure we should be letting everyone wander in and out of the castle like this. it doesn't seem safe. oh, these arusians won't hurt anything much.  besides, it's only fair to let them see the inside of a castle that's been sitting on their planet for so long. but who knows when zarkon will attack again. i'm going to do a perimeter check, just in case. commander sendak, the sentries are in position around the arusian village. luck is on our side. look, the castle defenses are down. the door is wide open. with all these arusians coming in and out, it should be nothing for you to infiltrate.  i may not have to. look. the small one has a galra drone they've repurposed. if i can just get close enough to clone its signature code, i can send our bomb drone in undetected. i knew you would not disappoint me, haxus. look at them, the new paladins of voltron. the fate of the universe is on their shoulders.   my eyes.  i must portray strength, so no one can tell how concerned i am about the fate of our mission.  let's keep that a secret.  who else has secrets. hunk tried to eat what.  that is rather amusing. what other secrets.  that seems like lance. pidge is a what. hmm  are you sure. i'm getting to the bottom of this. i guess we should get used to this space juice. who knows when we'll get back home again. yeah, if ever. what do you mean. i mean, if this zarkon guy has been ruling for 10,000 years, how long do you think it will take for us to fix it. you know, if we live. right. that. hey, what do you think the chances are of us landing on a nacho planet. well, there's only one planet with veradera beach, pizza shack looking over the water and the garlic knots and my mom's hugs  i'm sorry. i think this nunvill is getting to me. i gotta go.  so, pidge, we haven't had a chance to really talk. tell me about yourself. hmm well, i like peanut butter, and i like peanut butter cookies, but i hate peanuts. they're so dry. also, i sweat a lot. i mean, in general, unrelated to the peanuts. i suppose i was thinking of something a little more personal. we have a lot in common. like what. oh, well, both of us had our fathers taken away by zarkon. yeah, but i'm going to get mine back.  i'm sorry. i really didn't mean to no, i understand. i just want you to know that you can confide in me. if there's anything you ever want to talk about anything. huh. okay. i do have something to tell you. i had a feeling. what is it. i'm leaving team voltron.  wait, what. i decrypted the information from the galra ship about where my family might be, or at least where they were. i've made up my mind. i'm leaving tonight. pidge, you can't. you're one of five paladins. you have a sacred trust to defend the universe. my first priority is to find my family. i thought you of all people would understand. if you had a chance to get your father back, wouldn't you. i'm sorry. i should go tell everyone else.  shiro. i need to talk to you.  signature code cloned. bomb activated.  mind if i join you. how far away from earth do you think we are, coran. let's take a look. earth is over here. and we're all the way over you ever notice how far the planets are from each other, coran. yes. haven't you been paying attention. yeah, but i mean, like, they're really, really far away. like, say, earth. it's so far, i can't even see it. the the blue oceans, the white clouds, green grass i i can't see any of it. you miss earth. i understand. i miss altea. i know we're supposed to be brave paladins and defenders of the universe or whatever, but, honestly, i just want to go home. if i could go home, i would.  i miss rain and splashing in puddles. rain. yeah. it's water that falls from the sky.  oh, we had that on altea. only, it wasn't water, more like rocks. razorsharp and boilinghot. oh, they could knock a hole right in your head.  sounds fun.  yeah. pidge, no. the download from the galra ship was enough to at least get me in the right direction to start my search. i have a pod all ready to go. you can't leave. you can't tell me what to do. if you leave, we can't form voltron. and that means we can't defend the universe against zarkon. you're not the only one with a family. all these arusians have families. everyone in the universe has families. yeah, i have a family. they live on earth. i want to be with them. is that, like, a thing that can happen. you want to leave, too. of course i do. look, voltron is supercool, don't get me wrong, but i never signed up for a lifetime in space, fighting aliens. you're putting the lives of two people over the lives of everyone else in the entire galaxy. keith, that's not how a team works. people have to want to be a part of it. they can't be forced. if you want to leave, we won't try to stop you. but, please, just think about what you're doing. i'm sorry. you're going to have to find someone else to pilot the green lion.  i can't believe it. this team is falling apart. how will we ever form voltron. hey, rover. wait. where's pidge.   coran, look out.    huh.       what happened.  i'm not sure.  the crystal. lance. lance. lance.  we have to get lance to the infirmary. without the crystal, the castle has no power. he doesn't look good. lion warriors, our village is under attack. we need help. let's get to the lions. you can't. they're sealed in their hangars. there's no way to get them out. we're defenseless. will you not help us. we'll help you. we just  this is bad. we have to get a new crystal to get the castle working again. but, to get a new crystal, we need a ship. the pod i was loading, we can use that. i left the bay door open. i can use the scanner in the pod to see if there's a balmera nearby. hunk, you come with me. i'll need someone big to help me carry the crystal. a balmera. it's where the crystals come from. i'll tell you about it on the way. i'll go see what's happening at the arusian village. i'll go with you, keith. i brought this on the poor arusians. i'll tend to lance and stand watch over the castle.  it's our first bit of luck. there's a source not too far. we won't need a wormhole to get there, thankfully. i made some modifications to the shuttle. the first change is a cloaking device that i reverseengineered from the invisible walls on the training deck. the second is a tank of booster fuel that i mounted on the fuel line. using that during flight would turn the whole pod into a bomb.  okay. maybe you shouldn't use that modification after all.  we ready to hit it. right. let's go. good luck. hang on, buddy. help is on the way. sendak. stand aside. no. you're not getting in. yes, i am.       i see you spent some time with the druids. they do love to experiment. too bad you didn't get the latest model.       let him go or your friend won't make it.  voltron is ours. oh, no. what's happening. look. attackers. i'll go in for a closer look. stay here with them. keith.  what. oh, no. they tricked us.  it was just a diversion to separate us and thin the castle defenses.  power up the castle. the lions are all in their bays. raising particle barrier. begin launch sequence.  we're too late. no. they have control of the castle. they're taking voltron. make contact with emperor zarkon. sendak. my mission is complete. i've captured the altean castle, along with all of the voltron lions. i am currently preparing for launch and will be delivering them all to you shortly. this news is most pleasing. you have done your duty. vrepit sa. vrepit sa. haxus, ready the castle for takeoff. yes, commander. can we break through the barrier. no. and whoever has taken the castle has a crystal, which means they'll be able to fly the ship. we have to stop them. how are we going to do that.  keith, can you hear me. pidge, is that you. where are you. i'm inside the castle. sendak has taken over and he's preparing for launch. he's got lance and shiro. pidge, listen. if they've started the launch sequence, then we don't have much time before liftoff to stop it. what do i have to do. you have to get down to the main engine control panel and disconnect the primary turbine from the central energy chamber. if you can do that, sendak will have to reset the whole system. that might give us enough time to find a way to stop them.  is this the balmera planet with the crystals. it's not a planet. balmera are ancient animals. petrified, but still alive. their bodies naturally create the crystals that help power mini altean ships. i often accompanied my grandfather to visit these majestic creatures when he was building the castle of lions. i'll never forget the first time i saw the sparkling surface of a balmera. you're in for quite a treat. oh, no. this is horrifying. the galra have turned this into a mining colony. they're completely destroying it. they have no regard for the poor creature.   uhoh. we've been spotted.  hailing unidentified craft. state your ship id, entry code, and landing destination. oh, no. what do we do. just stay calm.  we don't really need to land. uh, we're just looking around, if that's okay.  unidentified craft, land immediately and prepare to be boarded. okay. thank you. see you down below.   not done yet. hang on.     coran. coran.  how deep is this thing.  oh, no, no, no.       coran, what lives at the bottom of these mines.  here, rover.  okay, rover, here we go. run main cluster activation sequence. activation sequence initiated. powering up for launch. okay, allura, i'm near the turbine. i think it's started. then you'll have to hurry. cross the catwalk to the main column in the center. okay. now, open the hatch. find the central computer control hub and enter the following sequence wait, wait, wait, wait. which one is it. all the labels are in altean. commander sendak, we are ready for launch. i can't tell which one it is. allura. allura. uh i've lost connection with pidge. oh, no. it's taking off.  uh whatever.  huh.    the main engine just shorted out.  we have a saboteur. find him and take him out )
