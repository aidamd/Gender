1    what. what'd i miss. oh, nothing important. we've just figured out a way to defeat zarkon. really. i dozed for ten minutes, and you guys figured out how to defeat the forces of evil. you've been asleep for three hours. i think we've got something here. it's dangerous and there are a lot of moving parts, but if we can coordinate everything just right, then zarkon's reign will be at an end, and the savagery that's poisoned our universe can finally be cleansed. you've done it, shiro. we did it together. as long as we all stick to the plan, it should work. it will work. perhaps, then, you'll learn that not all galra are as bad as zarkon. i hope not.  ulaz was right to trust you all. he sacrificed everything to bring us together. let's honor him by taking down zarkon.  so, what's the plan. the plan is amazing. first, we infect zarkon's ship with a virus. then, we make an extralarge wormhole and lure zarkon inside of it, zapping him a bajillion lightyears away. then, when he pops out on the other side, all like, "oh, why doesn't my ship work." voltron kicks his butt. pew, pew, pew. womp, womp, womp. huh. hiyah.  "i'll form the head."  that's what you say, shiro. yeah, yeah. yeah. we won for all time. wow. so, this is it. i guess the only question is, when do we strike. as soon as we build a teludav big enough to wormhole zarkon's ship. oh, man. the teludav again. does that mean we need more scaultrite. that's just one of the many things we'll need. am i, uh am i sensing a trip back to the space mall here.  i'm afraid not. this is gonna take a lot more scaultrite than we can find at any unilu shop. for this plan to succeed, we're gonna need to split up. we all have a task to do. keith, hunk, you'll be in charge of getting the scaultrite. if any one of us fails, the entire plan fails.  so, how about a kiss for good luck.   don't worry, we'll see each other soon. take care, coran. stay safe, princess.  did you sense the lion.  nothing. it is wise that you rest. i will find that lion. begin the process again. why does allura get to take a leisurely visit to the balmera while we have to fly into the belly of a giant space worm to get scaultrite. you heard coran. building a huge teludav isn't easy. everyone has a job to do and this is ours. but i always get the worst jobs. go to a galraoccupied planet to get my lion. go to a galraoccupied balmera to get a crystal. go into a belly of a beast with the only galra alien team member. i'm not an alien. well, you're kind of an alien. you're way more alien than me. you're at least some alien. i'mi'm none alien.  let's just concentrate on the job here. yeah. waswas your mom the alien. your grandpa. how galra are you. i don't know. did the blade of marmora, like, teach you the secret handshake, or something. no. no one said anything. the blade of marmora they're real tightlipped, aren't they. i get that your society is secret, but is everything a secret. okay, look, it's bad enough that allura hates me now. can you just lay off. allura doesn't hate you. you just need to give her time to accept the fact that you're galra, the race that destroyed her entire planet and all of her people. yeah, she might hate you a little bit. let's just watch the video coran uploaded and stay on task. we need to find out how to collect this stuff. hello, brave altean. no way. is that coran. so, you're about to go into the belly of a weblum to harvest scaultrite. good for you. scaultrite is an important substance, with thousands of commercial and industrial uses, including fabrication foam, insect night vision goggles, teludav uh antifungal klanmirl lotion and other such lubricants. what's wrong with the video. it's ten thousand years old. it's probably corroded. i could go on for days. but you've got a weblum to enter and some scaultrite to collect. oh, look. there's a weblum now. hello, big fella. hey, coran. i'm off to eat some planets. there's one now. nyum, nyum, nyum, nyum, nyum. we'll see you soon. as you probably remember from school, the weblum is an enormous creature and an integral part of keeping our universe functioning. it survives off of the left over from dead planets. it then reconverts the quintessence remnants by becoming the building blocks of new solar systems. incredible, isn't it.  of course, these are no gentle giants. they're actually giants that are quite deadly, which leads to rule number one. it's an important one, so listen closely. stay away from its you got that. no. no, i didn't. it's like a rhyme. say it with me. stay away from its oh, come on. other things to remember include avoiding the poisonous eye sockets could lead to certain death. whoa. what are those.  they look like dead planets. that's strange. the charts i'm looking at show these planets should still be thriving. wow. what do you think happened to them. asteroid strike. something tells me they died an unnatural death.  look.  guess that ancient altean weblum tracker put us right on the money. we gotta get out of here. we haven't watched the entire video yet. we don't know what to do. we're not leaving. you fly, keep our distance. i'll skim through the video. so, you've made it into the weblum's first stomach.  rewind.  i know.  so, you've identified a weblum. great. now, remember rule number one. stay away from its face.  wait, that's rule number one. we broke rule number one.  oh, no. what's it doing. get us out of the way, now.  the weblum's natural defense venomous laser, deadly acid total annihilation death monster to find its blind spot on the back of its neck, just below the gills. that's your way inside. if i can't see ya, i can't kill ya.   this isn't good. this isn't good.  we're attached to its back, in its blind spot. good. we're going in. wait, what do we do when we're inside the beast. a quick recap of what to do when you're inside the beast. one, avoid things that want to kill you. two, get to the third stomach and find the scaultrite gland. three, activate the weblum's defense mechanisms and collect the excess material from the gland. that's the scaultrite. seems simple enough. seems underexplained. come on.     got it, got it. why are you tampering with evidence. commander thace, i was ordered to assist you in your investigation into the possible traitors on board. ordered by whom. haggar. i've analyzed the sentry that was destroyed just before the shields went down. the one that was killed by prorok. i've already examined him. so, you found the trace elements of luxite on the wound. it's a very rare metal. if we find others on the ship in possession of luxite, we will have found our traitors. then what are you waiting for. begin the search starting with the lower block. i'll assign some sentries to that. is there anything else. as chief investigator, your life could be in danger. i have been given orders to remain by your side until we clear all personnel or find the spy.  uh, yuck. what am i standing on. a mucus pocket. i do not like mucus. and is that steaming stomach acid. lookit, right over there. oh, man, i really hope i don't see any blood. hunk. knock it off. you're freaking yourself out. no, standing inches away from a pusbubble is freaking me out.  look, we're inside a disgusting worm. there's no way to sugarcoat it. we're gonna need that big brain of yours if we want to make it through. will you be all right.  i said, will you be all right. uh okay, okay.  i'll be okay. good. i gotta be able to count on you. besides, no one knows an explosive digestive tract like you. wait, wait, wait. did you just make a joke.  seriously, that was a joke, wasn't it. you're saying i throw up a lot. i get it. it's funny.  i do. wow. galra keith is way funnier than regular keith. okay, we need to find a way around the stomach acid. huh. what are these things. uh uh i don't know. maybe they're bacteria. uh oh  wait, wait, wait. they seem friendly. they seem friendly. maybe they're good bacteria. they like me. they're  they're tickling me. wait, that's not tickling. that's hot acid.  they want to kill us. they want to kill us. i think they're part of the creature's digestive system. they're trying to break down the food and we're the food.  i can't see anything.   hunk. i'm here, surrounded by blood. i hate blood.  you've gotta find a way out of the circulatory system. hunk. i'm outnumbered here. meet me in the third stomach. gotta get out of this acid.   huh.   what the. impossible.  i don't like bloodslides.   oh, no. don't move. i'm here to help. huh.   you're galra.  not those things again. what are you doing.  you're turning this ship into a bomb.     keith. keith, are you there. keith, answer me.       i guess you can keep your weapon.    oh, my gosh, i found it.  oh, my gosh, don't throw up. don't throw  keith. keith, you made it. we both made it. who is this. someone i found. he doesn't talk much. also, he's galra. what, do you guys all know each other.  are you sure we should be rescuing a galra soldier right now. we're paladins of voltron. we can't just leave people to die even if they are galra. now, come on. let's get what we came for and get out. okay, well, that that might be a problem, too. the scaultrite gland somehow secretes mucus, or saliva, or something gross, which becomes crystallized. the only problem is, i think that we have to trigger the weblum's defense mechanism.   not again.   uh   they're everywhere. oh, whoa.  i think this thing is getting rid of the excess gas produced from its multiple stomachs. what. it's farting.   hunk, what do we gotta do to get that scaultrite gland to goop. uh, oh. uh wait a second, wait a second, wait a second. "stay away from its face. " the blue laser. ah. i know what to do. what. if we want that third stomach gland to secrete the ooze, i need to get farted out of the weblum's butt and attack the face, getting it to fire its laser puke. for the sake of the universe, i'll provoke the beast. you two stay here and get that scaultrite. hurry. i don't know how long we can hold these things off.  i'm out. heading to my lion now.   commander, there you are. the lower block has been scanned for luxite. i found nothing. then continue the search. sir, i must remain by your side. haggar's orders. hunk, whatever you're gonna do, do it now. roger that. provoking giant space worm now. come on. hunk. let's see you ignore me now. yoohoo. over here. yes. yes, it's gonna do it. oh, no, it's gonna do it.  it's working. i think it's about to get hot in here.  oh, yes. oh, no.   oh, yeah. he's out.  tell me you got the scaultrite. grabbing it now.  so, you're just like the rest of 'em. i'm coming out.  on my way. where's your buddy. he's long gone by now, and he got a bag of scaultrite. what. should we go after him. no. whatever the galra are planning won't matter after we defeat zarkon. copy that. by the way, hunk, you really came through in the clutch back there. without you, the mission would have been a failure. aw, thanks, galra keith. you're all right. i think turning galra has made you a better human. i didn't just turn galra. )
