lotor's cruiser is on the other side of the planet. at our current rate of speed, we'll be within attack range in an hour. good. hold formation.  oh, apologies, hunk. mm, is attacking right now such a good idea. you know, since not everyone is so great with their lions. do you mean me, specifically. you. no. no way, i didn't i'm just simply pointing out that more than half of the team are in new lions. maybe now's not a great time to bite off more than we can chew.  you can blame our hotheaded leader for that one. first, you want me to lead, and then you complain about how i do it. prince lotor is the heir to the galra throne. we could end his reign right now. allura, you doing okay in blue. i'm fine. i've been flying the castle for half my life. i just need a few ticks to adjust to the lion. good because we're going in.  the lions will be on us in one varga. what are your orders. i say we turn around and start shooting. we just learned all five lions are operational. there's still much we don't know. keep the cruiser on this heading until my return. ready my fighter. i'm going to attack the lions myself. you'll never take them all out alone. i'm not trying to. i'm detecting movement.  so much for the element of surprise. it's just a single fighter. where's the rest of them. probably scrambling as we speak. let's take it out.    lance, what are you doing. sorry. red here is a lot faster than i'm used to. uh, where'd that fighter go. come on, move.  i can't shake him. someone get this guy off my tail.  coming in on your six.  allura. i'm sorry, keith.  seriously, does this thing have brakes.    allura. allura.  whoa. what's up with this guy. he's playing us against ourselves.  it's gotta be lotor. ow. allura, you okay over there. i'm fine, but these controls are not responding, not like the castle. what's wrong with you, lion. do as i command. move. maybe someone should suggest to allura that flying the lion is different than flying the castle. hey, i already told her yelling at her lion wouldn't work. didn't go over well. she yelled at me, too. yeah, count me out. she scares me when she's under pressure. i can hear you.   keith, what should we do. how about this. everyone stay out of my way.  great. great leadership.   okay, this isn't working. we need to form voltron. everyone. in formation. uh, guys. guys, i'm not really feeling that voltron feeling. keep going. it's not happening.  what is going on. guys. fighter.  how disappointing. it appears that the reality of voltron does not live up to the legend.  well, that was embarrassing.  so should we call it quits. maybe go back, regroup, get a meal. no. i know everyone is struggling, but we can't let lotor slip away. acxa, set course for these coordinates. i'm going to lure the lions there. thayserix. why. these are not the paladins who defeated my father.  what. how do you know. they do not fight as a unit and are unable to form voltron. perhaps my father did as much damage to their team as they did to him. whatever the case, they're vulnerable and we need to take advantage.  recalibrating your fighter to adjust for the atmospheric changes on thayserix now. what. what happens on thayserix. the planet is made of dense gases and has unusual magnetic poles that distort and wreak havoc on normal sensors. oh so, once the lions are there, they'll be blind. no offense, narti.  keep the cruiser in orbit around thayserix. i'll flush the lions out one by one for you to capture. he's trying to hide from us.  we may not want to follow him. we don't know what's in there. huh.  guys, we have a problem. my sensors are going crazy. i think it's due to this planet's atmosphere and what must be strange magnetic poles. we can't worry about that now. i'm not letting this guy get away.  keith, without accurate sensors or working equipment, we're not gonna be able to tell what's up or down, where we are, or how to get out. i say we fall back. no, keep going.  going.  what. all i heard was "going. " are we going back. is anyone else getting this static. i'm losing visuals on you all. i need you to slow down.  we gotta keep up. he's getting away. guys, i think this gas is messing with our radios. we gotta stay close if we want to be able to communicate.  i think we made it through the worst of it.    no. no.  allura took a hit. i'm going after her.  hunk.  the rest of you, stay on me.  keith, we have to go back for allura.  keith, you're splitting up the team. keith, don't do this.   stop toying with them. bring the pain. is everyone okay. i'm sorry that i slowed us down, but the blue lion isn't listening to me. it's okay. we're a team. we stick together. isn't that right, keith. it's not about the team. we have a mission that's more important than any one of us. we need to find lotor and stop him, and i plan on doing that right now.  come on, guys. we'd better stick together.    prince lotor requires your assistance on planet thayserix. we expect you here immediately. lotor is right on top of the lions. they have no idea.  why isn't he firing. he could be tearing them to shreds right now. blow them up, lotor. he can't. the area he's in is full of red syntian nitrate, a highly combustible gas that reacts violently to amplified emissions of light.  this is gonna be good. this is crazy. we can't see a thing. stay together. he's around here somewhere. i know it. there.  where did he go.  no clue. our radars are worthless in here. hey, is it just me, or does anyone else get the feeling this guy is just toying with us. i'm with you, big guy. i'm getting a case of the heebiejeebies. he must have lured us here on purpose. up there.  we need to get out of here. we've been led into a trap. the tables have turned. he's flipped the script. the hunters have become the hunted. hunk, shouting taglines is getting us nowhere. lance is right. remain calm and get ready. he's gonna attack again. everyone, circle up. we need to be prepared for anything. as soon as you see him, fire with everything you've got. now. fire.   hello. paladins, help. i am impressed that you're able to hide, but i will find you.   what happened back there. where's the rest of the team. this is all my fault. i followed him right into this trap. everyone warned me, but i didn't listen. i put the entire team in jeopardy. yeah, you kinda did. but now we gotta fix it. you're right. let's go. hello. anyone.   oh   is anyone there. hello. pidge. hunk. oh, my gosh. omg. i'm so glad i found you. okay, what kind of computery stuff can you do to fix the radar, find everyone and get us all out of here. actually, i can't recalibrate my system without a data constant, which i could have gotten had we not rushed into this gas planet. so, what are you saying. i'm saying we're stuck.  hello. can anyone hear me.   okay. stay calm, allura. think. what would lance do.  hey there, blue lion. you know, you're really activating my particle barrier right now.  nothing works. i've tried asking you nicely, and i've tried commanding you. what do you want from me. i can't do this. everyone depends on me. the universe depends on me, but i can't control everything. i i need your help.    i can hear you.    help me. guide me. i can't do it alone.    a sonar map. are you thinking what i'm thinking, blue. someone's learning. come on. almost. nitrate gas. now, let's see if this freeze ray works in here.   i've lost control of the left wing. well played, paladin. we did it, blue. now, we need to find the other paladins.  hey, pidge. here's the scenario. you're stranded on a scary gas planet, and you only have one food to eat for the rest of your life. what's it gonna be. maybe a burrito. you like burritos, right. mine would be a burrito.  hailing pidge and hunk. are you paladins looking for an exit. no way. you guys found us.  actually, allura found you. she found all of us. she was able to connect with her lion.  wow. how did you do it. i just had to get into a lancelike mindset and stop thinking so much. yeah, think like lance. wait a minute. are you calling me dumb. no, i'm calling you a natural. naturally dumb. yeah, he was born with it. look, i'm glad we're all making fun of lance, but we still have to find a way out of here. follow me. i know a way out. wait a tick. everyone, we have company. it looks like lotor called for backup.  oh, man. it's always something.  we have to form voltron. but we were not able to form voltron the last time we tried. we have to keep trying. we may have come here fragmented and disorganized, but the only way we're getting out of here is if we work together. this is our team. shiro believed in us. we have to believe in ourselves. who's with me.  yeah. now, form voltron.    i'm picking up an energy signature i haven't seen before. hunk, i'm a leg. pretty cool, right.   lotor's getting away. should we go after him.  no. pushing the team too hard is what got us in this mess in the first place. we'll face him again when we're ready. roger that, team leader. where are we going. voltron is back there. this is our time to fight. a leader must know when to leave the field of battle. we'll face them on a day of our choosing. they can form voltron, after all. will that be a problem. no. an opportunity. )
