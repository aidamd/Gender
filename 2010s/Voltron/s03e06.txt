 all right, team, i've got my eye on the targets. i'll cover you from up he hey, keith, i had that guy. they're still coming.  well, that was awesome. pidge, could you maybe hurry it up a little. almost  there.  great job, pidge. that's the last outpost in this quadrant. call the blade of marmora. let them know this base is cleared.  i don't know. the last thing i remember was zarkon trying to overtake the black lion. it told me to use my bayard. then, just nothing. i woke up, and i was back on a galra ship. well, you'd just unlocked the black lion's ability to teleport. could it have teleported you. maybe it was trying to save you. by teleporting me into the hands of the galra. maybe zarkon forced it to. he was trying to control the black lion up until the very last moment, right. yeah, maybe. well, if you're feeling up to it, the rest of the team would be thrilled to see you up and around again. they need you, you know. yeah, i'll try. okay, we'll be on the bridge. hey, keith. yeah. how many times are you gonna have to save me before this is over. as many times as it takes. great job out there, everyone. you've really turned the tide in this war. i'm glad you never lost sight of the mission while i was gone. you're looking better. how are you feeling. good. just trying to get rid of this weird headache.  guys, i think i have something here. so, i downloaded intel from the galra base we just defeated. i untied the quantumfolded encryption, and i found something on lotor. do you know where he is. well, not exactly, no, but the last three sightings of his command ship have been in the va'kar quadrant. nice work, pidge. although, those quadrants are massive. how will we pinpoint his location. hey, that comet is made from the same material as voltron. maybe i can scan the emission spectrum for fraunhofer lines, like when i found the blue lion. but you know those emissions are subject to free induction decay. those are exponential dropoffs. yeah, but if you could find a way to amplify the sensors no, there'd be way too much interference. what if, instead, we increase the sa magnitude. the spires of the castle. genius.  i have no idea what either of them just said. let's set a course for the va'kar quadrant while they get started on that detector. we need to work fast. who knows what lotor has planned for that comet.  yeah. hey, man. i just wanted to talk with you because well, because i've been worrying about something. must really be bothering you if you're coming to talk to me. well, i mean, you're the leader now, right. i guess. i've been doing some math. with shiro back, that makes six paladins, but there are only five lions, and if i'm right, that's one paladin too many. solid math. look, when shiro takes over the black lion, you're going to want your red lion back. if i get a lion, i'd have to take blue from allura. but she's progressed a lot faster than any of us did. she might even be able to unlock powers we don't know of. that's true. so, maybe the best thing i can do for the team is step aside. what are you talking about. this isn't a participation game. this is war. and you want your best soldiers on the front lines. stop worrying about who flies what and just focus on your missions. things will work themselves out. okay. thanks. and, lance leave the math to pidge.  thanks for hooking me into the system.  i would've never been able to reach back there.  sorry, i know you got all dirty. i owe you guys a little mouse shower now, okay. i'm gonna get to work on that right after we find lotor. hey, can we fire this up and see if it works.    uh maybe we didn't adjust the polarity correctly.    uh, guys. guys, i found the comet, but it's booking it away from us. coran. allura. can someone altean come move this castle.  well done. we're on our way.  okay, we're gaining on it. make sure we stay far back enough to be undetected.  looks like the signal stopped in the ulippa system. activating longrange scanners. that's not lotor's ship.  but the comet is in there. okay, team, we need to get that here's the plan, everyone. oh, i'm sorry. go ahead, shiro. we need to get that comet. they must be transporting it into that base. it'll be vulnerable during the transfer. that's the best time to strike. who the heck are these guys. i don't think they're moving the comet to that base. we need more information. you're right. you take the black lion. i'll stay with coran in the castle and provide support. keith, are you sure. i'm sure. what's wrong.  shiro, where are you. we need you right now.  keith, i'm gonna need you to lead this mission.  what. what is it. what's wrong. the black lion isn't responding to me. it looks like you're its true paladin now. i'm coming down.  this may be the worst post in the galra empire. but it's my post. victory or death. the most important thing is for you to get eyes on that comet. second is figuring out who we're dealing with.   you. lotor sent you to finish off what he started.  shiro, we've just boarded the ship. there's no crew in sight. moving forward with the search.    this way. let me finish him off. no, you know the plan.  my life doesn't matter. all that matters is the empire.   shutting down security.   sounds like the fight next door is over. let's hurry. retracting roof.  coran, give me a closer look at that. is that. the teludav. what, in the name of king groggery the infirm, is going on.  the comet should be in here.  like, right here. where's the comet. is it in that ship.  i think the ship is the comet. no, it can't be. he's already made a ship from the comet's ore. oh, this is bad. more like horrible.  guys there's a piece of the teludav inside the galra base. the one we used to wormhole zarkon's ship. but they would never be able to operate it without an altean  zarkon's witch. she had altean markings. is anyone else kind of freaking out. yep, mark me down for one freakout. lotor must be nearby. we need to find him and take him out for good. team, you cannot let lotor get that ship. you need to get back to your lions. you need voltron. why take out one ship when we can stop all of this by taking out lotor himself. we can't let him keep outsmarting us. that's exactly why we can't risk letting lotor have that ship. this is too important. keith, i want to stop lotor just as badly as you, but shiro has a point. okay, you guys go back to the lions. i'm gonna search the ship for lotor. keith, you need to stick together. yeah, i'm with shiro on this one. as am i. me, too. yeah, man. fine. let's move.   huh.  yah.        i got you, buddy.  huh.     pidge, a little help.   it's been a long time since i've faced a worthy opponent. i'm going to enjoy crushing you.    we don't have time for this. we need to get to the lions. good idea.  zethrid, stop. come on. this is our chance to destroy them. we have what we came for. stick to the plan. okay, seriously, what is going on. i mean, who were they. i've met one of them before, in the weblum. she stole some of the scaultrite. allura, you said they had an altean. they must be trying to build a teludav so they can make wormholes. if lotor has turned the comet into a ship, we have much bigger concerns. i thought lotor took over for zarkon. why is he attacking a galra base. i don't know. that's why we have to stop him here and now.  we have to stop that cargo ship. on it. that must be the ship made from the comet. then let's be careful. raise particle barrier. fire castle defenses. a quick little bugger, isn't it. i've never seen something that size move that fast. that blast cut right through the particle barrier. team, where are you.  we can't take another hit like that. form sword. keep voltron engaged until the cargo ship is out of range. do not be drawn in. the sword strike is his most deadly blow.  it's too quick. guys, the cargo ship is escaping with the teludav inside of it. i thought taking down the ship made from the comet was the most important thing. we still can't let lotor get away with the teludav. shiro's right. we need to destroy it. but the comet is right here. we need to take it down. keith, the cargo ship is getting away. we have them right where we want them. they can either defend or go after the teludav and leave themselves vulnerable.  guys, the teludav's getting away.  keith, what should we do. you're going to have to lower your shield, shoot the cargo ship, and deal with the consequences. we can beat this ship first, and then get the cargo ship. there's not enough time. you need to make a decision.  hunk, get your bayard ready. on my cue, we're gonna lower the shield and shoot the cargo ship. ready.  ready. they're going to attack the cargo ship. prepare to fire as soon as the shield goes down. go. fire now. fire again.   your failure is most disappointing. return before more galra ships converge on your location.   so, lotor was attacking the galra base and trying to steal the teludav. none of this makes any sense. we can talk about this later. they're getting away. we need to go after them. no. get back to the castle. something strange is going on here, and we need to figure it out. i'm sorry i had to step in back there. i thought i had it under control. you need to learn to pick your battles. sometimes, you have to make hard choices. i'm no good at this. yes, you are. it was your quick thinking that prevented lotor from getting away with the teludav. you're gonna get there. the black lion has chosen you. i'm proud of you, keith. i can't remember anything, except that whoever it was had the correct landing codes. i swear. you must believe me. i believe you, but you still must pay for your failure.  )
