engine rumbling]    shiro.  he's gone. there's nothin' out here, coran. i'm sorry, keith.  i'm comin' home.  i'm worried it smells a bit musty. it's been a while since i've had to look presentable. the cubserions just declared independence after a thousand years of oppression, so they probably won't notice. then why am i getting all puffed up like a trufalian meringue. this is going to be a serious diplomatic meeting. remember, princess, 70 percent of diplomacy is appearance. then 29 percent is manners, decorum, formalities and chitchat. it's really only one percent serious business about fighting for the freedom of the universe. yes. that. oh, and i forgot hors d'oeuvres. oh, that's at least two percent. so i'll have to recalculate my we just freed these planets. do you really think they're ready to come together to fight the galra. i don't think it's a question of wanting to fight back, but of believing that it's possible. it's up to you to give them that faith. it should be voltron. we can't always put the fate of the universe in the hands of a giant weapon. at least, that's what your father believed. about 30 ticks to the drop zone. you ready, kolivan. affirmative.   hold on, evasive action underway. lance, i think we just passed the drop zone. we're under heavy fire. there's no way we can stop here.  kolivan, any ideas.  open the hatch. we'll take it from here. go. go. go.  think you're pretty good, huh. can you handle this. didn't think so. huh. hunk, you got a fighter right on your six. yeah, and i'm about to teach this sentry a lesson about tailgating.  paladins. can you hear me. we hear you, what's up. we're pinned down by heavy artillery. we need air support.   i see it. i'll take it out.   uhoh. i can't get a safe angle of attack. maybe not from the front.  it appears the galra forces are evacuating.  yeah, and stay out. let's set 'em down over there and get ready for the parade.   now this is the kind of worldsaving that a paladin could get used to. whoo. you got that right. oh, methinks i'll try this one with all the legs.  nope. still alive.   whoo. yeah.  oh. ah.  hmm you know, based on our recent battles, it seems like the galra empire is kinda just falling apart. it's more than that. look. whoa.   word of voltron's triumph is spreading. yeah, i guess the only problem is that we can't form voltron anymore. that cannot stand. the universe needs voltron.  lions of voltron, the people of puig thank you for delivering us from the evil hands of the galra empire. don't forget the blade of marmora. we couldn't have done it without kolivan and his team. it was our honor. yes. i want to pledge to you that every ablebodied puigian will join voltron in the fight against the galra. speaking of voltron, where is it.  voltron. voltron. voltron. voltron.  voltron. voltron. voltron. i think this might be a problem.  voltron. voltron.  oh, number five, you're back. how was your mission. i talked to some members of the desert tribes on planet kythra who have these same large feathered ears. they're not friendly to zarkon, but they couldn't help identify the person in the footage. so, that's a deadend. now, these flappy, loosey, pantthingies are skort pantaloons. very breathable. right. they're traditionally worn by the tando people. yes, in the valurian quadrant. right. that's on the other side of the galaxy. and what's this mask thing that they all have on their faces.  hmm. no idea. but it appears to be the perfect blend of fashion and function. okay. so my brother was either taken by intergalactic fashion pirates, or maybe the outer reaches of these galaxies are occupied by freedom fighters that are starting to work together against the galra empire. you know, i don't mind telling you this, but i was considered a bit of an intergalactic fashion pirate in my day. i used to have a bogwagglecape that i trained to sing my theme song whenever i entered a room.  maybe this will help. while i was gone i had the system analyze the sound of the explosion from the prison break.     huh. nanothermite titaniumboron. hey, maybe we can track that. good idea. while you do that, i'm gonna check in with lance and hunk and see how things went on planet puig.  don't worry, matt. i'll find you.  they haven't figured out their flatbread situation, but what they do with those centipedes is just out of this world. and they're totally ready to join the fight against the galra. nice. we brought back a few of their leaders to join the coalition. that's splendid. excellent work. you know, i gotta say, this is what it's all about freein' the people, lovin' the ladies, then bombin' down the road again looking for adventure, voltronstyle. which brings up a little issue. they all want to see voltron, only we don't really have voltron anymore. we don't have shiro anymore, either. everyone seems to have forgotten that. it may be difficult for us all to accept, but it is time to think about finding a new pilot for the black lion. no. i'm gonna find him. shiro is the one person who never gave up on me. i won't give up on him.    no one is to be allowed in emperor zarkon's chamber. vrepit sa. excuse me. what is it, commander throk. would it be possible to speak to zarkon today. another planet was lost to rebellion and i feel he must be informed. zarkon is fully briefed on all imperial matters. he certainly doesn't need your input. of course. it is just that i fear if we do not take decisive action soon, the empire will crumble completely. rebel activity should be crushed with our full might before more planets are inspired to fight against us. lotor has arrived at headquarters at zarkon's request to take command of the empire. under zarkon's guidance, of course. lotor. why is he not at his father's bedside. zarkon needs no one by his bedside. least of all, you. hmm.  it is our honor to have you all here together. i had the biggest bunker back on puig, but it wasn't nearly this nice.  well, i spent the last decade sleeping in a spiny thistle thicket. you look wonderful though, princess. i'm glad i put on my best tarp. welcome, everyone. welcome. i've prepared a few earth canaps for our distinguished guests to enjoy while we talk galactic diplomacy. the blade of marmora has gathered this intelligence. as you can see, the galra empire is still the most massive ruling force the universe has ever seen. the sheer size of it is almost incomprehensible. it seems like it could rule another 10,000 years.  not the way i would have started this pep talk, but okay. however, we are beginning to see signs of increased rebel activity from within the empire.  we have a strategy to bring these forces together, free more planets, grow our numbers, and accumulate an army that can defeat the galra in major battles. but without your help, it will be impossible.  the forces will all fight behind voltron, right. yes, where is voltron. the people you see before you are the paladins of voltron. together, they pilot the mighty lions that form the great warrior. excellent. can they form voltron now. uh, well we can't form voltron, okay. we can fly the lions, but voltron is not happening.  what he means is that right now they can't do it, but but nothing. shiro is gone. he was the black lion. and until we find him, there is no voltron. the lions are still a substantial fighting force and this castle is also a considerable weapon. the blade of marmora can lead you. my people have been enslaved for centuries by soldiers who look exactly like you. yes. our people have heard the legend of voltron, how he defeated zarkon. that is what gave them hope. what are we supposed to tell them now. tell them to stand up and fight for themselves. voltron is gone.   pizza roll. pig in a blanket. i'll have a pizza roll.    i tried to speak with lord zarkon today, but the witch stopped me again. i fear the emperor's condition may be worse than she is telling us. i'm not sure he will ever return to the throne. agreed. and now prince lotor is taking over. we've fought by zarkon's side forever, and now we are passed over by this exiled brat. i've heard rumors he fights alongside his enlisted men like a lowly private. worse than that, his top generals aren't even pure galra. they are halfbreeds at best. he has no honor.  some say he allows the planets he conquers to continue to rule themselves. can you imagine.  clearly he's a dangerous lunatic. i've already spoken with the other officers in my sector. they've all agreed to back me if i fight for the throne. normally, i would never think of such a thing, but what choice do we have. then you'll support me. yes.  who's this little fellow. i don't know. i've never seen him before.        huh. lotor. throk. you wish to challenge me. then come down and claim your crown.  true galra do not take the throne by stirring up insurrection in darkened chambers. they rise through honorable rite of combat. defeat me here and the throne is yours.   humph.   i gladly accept your offer.  now all will see who is the rightful leader. i have fought thousands of battles and left many enemies much more fearsome than you wasting on the battlefields.   you have flawless technique, that i'll grant you. still, you must realize at some point, that your repetitive attacks are getting you nowhere.     your tactics are stale. and in the end, your own aggression is your undoing.   lotor. lotor. lotor. lotor. lotor. lotor. lotor. lotor. lotor. lotor. lotor. lotor. lotor. lotor. lotor. lotor. huh. my father built our empire on the bones of his enemies. but the time has come to change the old ways, and inspire not fear from those we rule, but loyalty. we must not waste our energy fighting to keep our subjects down, but rather multiply it, by allowing those worthy to rise and join our ranks.  the universe can no longer doubt our strength. each ally gained only makes us stronger, while those who continue to stand against us will be crushed. lotor, we pledge our loyalty to you. vrepit sa.  lotor. lotor. lotor. lotor. lotor. lotor.   that went well. the masses are easily manipulated. have throk transferred out to the ulippa system immediately. let him rot with the ice worms. hey, man. listen we all miss shiro. i remember what a thrill it was to meet him for the first time when the two of us carried him out of that garrison hospital. i grew up with my dad and matt telling me stories about him. he was a legend at our house.  the guy taught me everything i know about being a pilot. which isn't much, but that's more on me. you're not the only one hurting, man. we're all right there with you. but you know that he would be the first one to tell us that we have to move on.  keith, i know exactly how you feel. but our mission is bigger than any one individual. even those who are completely irreplaceable. i know you're right. it's time to figure out how to reform voltron. )
