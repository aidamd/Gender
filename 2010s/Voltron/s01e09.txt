  i loved the smell of the mountain juniberries in the early morning breeze.  as did i, allura. remember the summer berry festival. people would come from all over altea for the harvest. i remember how the berry juice stained your favorite dress. you were so upset.  it took forever for mother to calm me. i miss altea so much. i miss you, father. i wish it didn't have to be this way. i know, allura, but, as leaders, we have to do what's right for our people, even if it means great sacrifice. i know, father. that's what you always say. princess, there you are. what are you doing up and about. you should be resting. oh, coran, can't i stay. the balmera rejuvenation ceremony took a lot out of you. come along, to your room. get your rest, darling. i will be here for you when you're well. i love you, father. i'll see you soon.  pidge, please come down to the detainment room.   okay, guys, sendak's almost all hooked up. but, look, i have to warn you, this technology was used to keep altean memories alive, not to interrogate prisoners. coran, we understand this isn't what the technology was meant for, but if we can extract sendak's memories, we may gain valuable intelligence on zarkon's troop locations. yeah, and then we can just be like, "knockknock. " "who's there." "the avenging fury of voltron, son." fascinating. so, how exactly does this work. as the memories are extracted, they're written bit by bit on individual molecules of the microstorage strands. when i go, i want all the stuff in my brain stored in a giant ship. the amount of information in your brain could be stored in a paper airplane. oh, yeah. well, the amount of information you have, keith, could be yeah. uh it's less than what i have. oh, good one, lance. this is how you incorporated king alfor's memories into the castle of lions. precisely, but it's never been attempted before on an unwilling participant. uh, is this what's supposed to be happening. let's give it some time.    well, i can't wait around anymore. i'm going to hit the training deck. okay, if anyone needs me, i'll be in the lab. maybe i can pull some information from sendak's galra crystal. time to feed the beast. i'm going to go make some breakfast. well, i'm afraid i can't wait here any longer, either. i have a million duties to attend to. between that galra crystal infecting our system, and then fighting off those ships and performing the balmeran rejuvenation ceremony, the old castle of lions has taken quite a beating. every system needs to be recharged and repaired. i'll stay. somewhere in sendak's mind is the information about zarkon that we need. okay, well, while you guys do that, i think i'm gonna get my chill on. maybe kick back with a lemonade or space juice. something. hold on there, space juice. you're going to come and help me. what. why. why me. because you're the last one here and because your activity isn't very important. wait, did i say "chill with a good lemonade". i meant i gotta do homework. no. too late. fine. let us know if anything happens. shiro. you got it. maybe today, we try a little crme goole. hmm.     my eye.   what is going on in here. the goo has me pinned down.   okay, we're going to have to flank the goo to shut it down. okay, wait. wait. it's been a pleasure cooking with you. go.   probably a malfunction. yeah, yeah. guess the kitchen system needs to be rebooted, too. leave it for coran.   since when did "you sleep in it, you clean it" become a voltron rule. also, how is it these pods have the ability to heal a human from near death, but don't have the ability to clean themselves.  selfcleaning pods. now, that's a good one. this kind of reminds me of my time as a young cadet. i had just enlisted in the altean space squad aeronautics subtech nanoweaponry unit, and i was sent off to boot camp. our sergeant had us cleaning cryopods day and night. i got so good at it, i earned my first set of stripes. huh.  coran. hey. oh, those were the days.  hey. anyway, you keep up the good work and maybe someday you'll earn some cleaning stripes, too. lance. lance. ah, paladins   start training level three.   end training sequence. end training sequence. end training sequence now.  i know you're in there, sendak. i know you have all the answers. give them to me.  you're a broken soldier. you can't hold out forever. so, you can hear me.   this pod just shut on me and locked me in, while you were rambling on about boot camp. you sure you didn't just trip and fall in. no judgment. it happens. besides, why would the pod automatically lock and start the cryogenic freezing process. to kill me. don't get your boots in a bunch. my guess is they're malfunctioning. okay, i'm gonna float this out there. i think this castle is haunted. the ship might seem like a fantastical, magical creature to you, but it's really just a big embodiment of advanced supernatural technology that cannot be explained by science alone. well, that does make it seem a bit haunted, doesn't it. but it's not. trust me, nothing out of the ordinary is happening here.   i'm okay. i'm okay, i'm okay, i'm okay.    allura. allura.   allura, dear daughter father, what are you doing here. huh. okay, okay.  coran, is that you. okay, stop messing with me, guys. this isn't funny.  help. help. hello. coran. help. somebody.  i'm trapped in the airlock. i'm coming.  huh. okay, haha. good joke. you guys got me. nice.  airlock opening in 30 ticks. okay, joke's over. you got me. 29, 28, 27 guys. guys. help.  what was the first rank you held in zarkon's army. where did you find the red lion. what is zarkon's greatest weakness.  what makes you think you can possibly defeat him. if you were to attack zarkon, where would you strike. why strike at all when you can join him.   i bet if we can modulate the dynamics of this crystal, we'll be able to reverse engineer a lot of galra tech. don't you think, hunk. hunk, are you paying attention. what. no, i'm sorry. that whole food goo ambush really set me on edge, pidge. if we can't trust food, we are lost as a culture. relax. i'm sure the castle's just glitchy. it's 10,000 years old. yeah, it does seem like the ship is not currently trying to kill us. okay, so, all the sensors are on the crystal. hit the switch.  hunk, did you accidentally hit the antigravity switch. uh, no. there's no antigravity switch. uh, is there.  curse my short arms. oh, i hate those little things. all right, forget it, pidge. i'm going to swim toward you. just hang on.  that's it. i'm all out of moves.  oh, i'm hungry again. i hope some food goo comes oozing out of these walls.  help. help. help. twelve, eleven, ten nine, eight, seven  keith. six, five what are you doing in there.  i need help. because if you don't get me out of here right now, i'm going to be sucked out into space. doors opening. i'm getting sucked out into space.     keith. keith, come on.   what were you doing out there. who was that guy. he was trying to kill me. well, is he the castle. because that's who's trying to kill me.  altean flowers are the most beautiful. it is sad that i will only see them in my dreams. but, when i wake, my memories are like these spores, scattered in the wind. altea is not merely a dream, allura. it still exists. the altean flower, you can see it. you can touch it. i can take you there. i can take you home. you can. would you like to go home. yes. i want to go back to altea, father. then come with me, and i will show you the way.  wait. wait, wait, wait. i have an idea. grab on.  yeah. we did it. now, what. now, kick me as hard as you can. what. no, we're friends. no, no. kick me so i can fly across the room and get to the control panel.  oh oh, oh. no, no, no.   how can you guys be taking a nap while this castle is trying to kill us. taking a nap. we've been floating around in zero g. you know how scary that is. that's not scary. that's fun. i was almost ejected into space. i got attacked by killer food, and that's the most horrifying thing you can imagine. the stuff of nightmares. it'll haunt me to my grave. well, i had a robot trying to kill me. i don't care what you say, coran. this castle has gone apples and bananas.  perhaps the infection from sendak's galra crystal is worse than we thought. well, let's get rid of it. it's too late. when sendak plugged it into the ship, it corrupted the entire system. sendak. wait. has anyone seen shiro.  we're connected, you and me. both part of the galra empire. no. i'm not like you. you've been broken and reformed. just look at your hand. that's not me. it's the strongest part of you. embrace it. the others don't know what you know. they haven't seen what you've seen. face it. you'll never beat zarkon. he's already defeated you. i'm not listening to you. do you really think a monster like you could be a voltron paladin. stop it.    i remember how you used to dance around this very ballroom. i can still hear you giggling. oh those were happy memories. we can create new memories, allura.  shiro, are you okay.  where's sendak. i i had to get him out of here. i was hearing his voice. he he can't be trusted on this ship. it is the ship. i got stuck in a cryopod, then, in an airlock. keith got attacked by a robot, and hunk and pidge got attacked by food. it's been a weird morning.  what. how is that possible. what is it. the ship is starting a wormhole jump. allura, what's going on. we're going to altea. we're going home. my father is taking us. stay away from my daughter.  uh allura, wake up. the crystal must have corrupted king alfor's artificial intelligence. it's taking over. we're headed straight for a star and it's about to explode. father, i can see altea. allura. allura, wake up. what you're seeing isn't real. the juniberries, the most exquisite flower of all. allura, please. you've got to listen to me. is this real. of course it is real, daughter. that flower you're touching is real.  but where is the fragrance of the sweet juniberries.  huh. that's not altea. when that star goes supernova, it will destroy the entire system. allura, you must reset the course and get us out of here.   father, please, i beg you to turn this ship around. if we don't do it soon, we will all perish. i know. that is my intention. what. why. don't you see, dear daughter. zarkon can never be defeated. he's been ruling for ten thousand years. but we must continue to fight. fight for what. it is all over for altea. you don't have to live a lifetime of war. you can be with me and the rest of your people. father, please. the paladins and i can still stop zarkon. somewhere in there, you must want that to happen. allura, my a. i. has been corrupted. you must disconnect my power source. we can stroll across the blossom canyon every morning, just like we used to. remember how much you loved that. i remember. i'll see you soon, father. i've got to get into the a. i. chamber to disconnect my father's power source manually. but that means losing king alfor forever. paladins, get to your lions. i need you to slow the castle's descent into the star. i can try to override the system to open the hangars.  don't do this. you must. all my memories, all my knowledge will be lost forever. do it, allura. if you are to live, we must say goodbye. i'm sorry about this, father.   huh.  oh, my dear daughter    father this is not real. this is all in the past.        you don't have to fight, allura. you don't have to make this sacrifice.  goodbye, father. goodbye, allura. she did it.  paladins, get to your hangars. we're getting out of here. i'm so sorry about your father, princess. we all are. thank you. but that was not my father. the real king alfor was a great man and a great father. he may not be here with us anymore, but his dream lives on through all of us, and his legacy is voltron. basic sync & corr. )
