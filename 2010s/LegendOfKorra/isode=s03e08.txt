earth. fire. air. water. only the avatar can master all four elements and bring balance to the world. korra is now the first metal bending avatar. at the training with su beifong, korra quickly picked up the new skill and bolin is hoping to follow in her footsteps. meanwhile the airbender zaheer is closing in on zaofu. by his side is are the lava bender ghazan, the water bender minghua, and the combustion bender p'li. but what do these mysterious criminals want with the avatar. i can't believe i'm sparring with the avatar. i can't believe i'm stuck with her friend. hang on, i think i got it. let me just try this. no. okay, maybe if i ahhh. trial by fire. it's the best way to learn metalbending. oh, nice shot, bolin. but i thought you were supposed to be practicing metalbending, not earthbending. yeah, cheater. mako, metalbending is extremely difficult. no one gets it right away, if they can get it at all. it's not normal. whoohoo. metalbending champion. oh, sure. she's the avatar. guys, it's time to get cleaned up. tonight's opal's farewell dinner. now i gotta say bye to opal. this is the worst day ever. thanks for making my favorite meal. i'm really going to miss you, opal. no one appreciates my raw veggie wraps like you do. every time i eat raw kale, i'm gonna think of you. you're so sweet. this stinks. we were just starting to get to know each other and now you're off to the northern air temple. we'll be together soon. you guys are heading up after finding more airbenders, right. yeah, but that's in the future. oh, i hate the future. until then, we'll always have kale. kid, can i give you some relationship advice. um, no. well, your loss. zhuli. bring the, uh, thing. check out my latest invention. an airbender finder. wait, that can find airbenders. uh, i think it's broken. it's not broken. she needs to airbend into it. how else do you expect the thing to work. what's going on. i can't hear anything. i hate sitting down here. not because of you. i can tell you're lying. everyone, if i could have your attention, please. tonight, my beautiful little girl leaves for the northern air temple. opal, none of us could be more proud of you. you're an incredible daughter, sister, friend, and soontobe airbending master. here's to opal. may she help lead us into the new era. lock it down for the night. we'll head out first thing in the morning. kale, kale, kale. what. what's going on. pabu, sleep. what. huh. what. pabu. it's not playtime right now. okay, we are seriously going to have to have a talk what the heck. they got korra. they've got korra. let her go. they've got korra. so much for the element of surprise. backup plan. we can't let them take her. i don't think they're going to get far. look. we have you surrounded. it's over. release the avatar. no way. that guy's lavabending. that's awesome ly not good for us. i'm going to create some cover. we're getting out of here. how did they get in here. i don't know, but we're not letting them escape. whoa. there's no way to cross that moat. we don't need to cross it. lin and i can drop in from the dome on cables. that's a great idea. except we'll get blown up the second that thirdeyed freak sees us. she's a combustion bender. if one of you can stun her, her powers will be knocked out temporarily. bolin can land a shot. i can. you have to take her out right before we drop down. i do. open the hatch. if we get in trouble, metalbend us up. we're in position. copy that. it's bolin time. all right. bolin time. bolin time. i can't get a clean shot. you have to. are we a go. no go. copy that. we're a go. i said no. wait. bolin, take the shot. nice job, little bro. no. thanks. we failed. where did they go. they can't be far. guards, search the entire estate. this should neutralize the shirashu toxins. how could you let this happen. you assured me this was one of the most secure places in the world. it is. i don't know how this happened. obviously this was a wellplanned operation, so don't blame me. we searched the entire estate. but there's no sign of them. well, keep looking. it would seem they had some inside knowledge of zaofu. they must have been working with someone. the. . the guards. it had to be one of them. i agree. question them all. whoever betrayed my city will suffer the consequences. what is your full name. where were you last night. do you have any knowledge of the people who tried to kidnap the avatar. my name is xu quan. i was patrolling the south wall of the beifong estates. i have absolutely no knowledge of the people that tried to kidnap korra. what was i doing last night. same thing i always do. from 9:00 to 10:00, i checked my body for ticks. lyme disease is a serious killer. then i did my nightly varricalisthenics followed by 30 minutes of breath holding. i filmed the whole thing if you want to watch it. that won't be necessary. maybe it wasn't a guard after all. maybe it was someone a little higher up the food chain. aiwei, why don't you question su. lin, stop. your sister wasn't involved. no, i'll gladly be questioned. i have nothing to hide. what is your full name. suyin beifong. i'm the daughter of toph and the only sister to lin, and i had nothing to do with the attack last night. she is telling the truth. argh. this is a waste of time. just bring in the next guard. give me your name and tell me where you are from. i'm hong li. i was born and raised here in zaofu. do you have any knowledge of the people who tried to kidnap the avatar. no. did you help the attackers enter zaofu last night. no, of course not. you're lying. what. no, i'm not. how did they get in and out. where are they now. i don't know. i'm telling you, i didn't help them. you're a traitor to the entire clan. i suggest we search his place. i got something. what. it looks like it's from them. "team assembled. ready to rendezvous. " and look at this. these are the guards' log books. all their schedules and routes are in here. that guard knows everything. we have to get him to talk. let's go confront him with this evidence right now. no. let's give him a little time to sweat it out. he will talk eventually. i don't understand why we're not talking to that guard right now. every minute we waste here, those guys get further away. i mean, how does a random guard get involved with a group of super criminals, anyway. what do you mean. that guard is only and has lived in zaofu his entire life. zaheer and his gang have been in prison for more than 13 years. i don't know, but we all saw the evidence. it's pretty overwhelming. maybe a little too overwhelming. hey, varrick. what are you doing here. collecting pumice stones with zhuli. that lavabender did a lot of damage. but he makes a nice exfoliating rock. and when you got calluses like mine, you take all the pumice stones you can get your hands on. or in my case, feet. ehh what were you saying about the evidence. i was saying that i can smell a conspiracy when i see one. look, if i was trying to set someone up, i would tell everyone he's guilty, and then plant the evidence in his apartment as proof. oh, you mean exactly like what you did to me. yes. just like that. remember how great that worked. well, not for you. you're right. all the evidence points to this guard, but maybe he's just the fall guy. but for who. for the only person who can truly keep a secret in this city, aiwei. he's not home. or he's hiding in there. or he's invisible. probably just not home. we have to get in there and find some evidence that links aiwei to zaheer, otherwise su won't believe us. it's just an empty book. oh, it's like a desert on a jar. bolin, put that back. we don't want aiwei to know we were in here if we can't find anything. uh you forgot where it goes, didn't you. look at these scuff marks. i think this bookshelf slides open. what do you think is down there. could be a storage cellar. or it could be how zaheer got in and out. aiwei's coming back. quick. what are you doing in my house. you are trespassing on the property of one of the highest ranked officials in the city. you had better have a good explanation. we do, we do. we actually knocked on your front door, and we thought we heard you say "come in. i'm in the bathroom." i don't even know why i'm saying that. you know i'm lying. and you don't even sound like that. we came here because things weren't adding up, and we thought you might have some answers. sit. if you want to talk, let's talk over some tea. so, what is not adding up, exactly. hong li was clearly lying, and we found evidence in his apartment. but don't you think it's weird how young he is. how did he ever get mixed up with this group. perhaps through a relative. or maybe he was bribed. we will find out those answers in time. but if it wasn't him, who do you think it was. we don't know. you don't think i had something to do with this, do you. we're just looking for answers. and you think you found something, don't you. you have no idea what is coming for you, avatar. come on. he's getting away. i'm still a little new at this, so back off. argh. he's gone. look. he must've escaped through there. help me clear it out. what happened. we heard an explosion. where is aiwei. your trusted advisor was the one who betrayed us. he was lying about the guard. what. no. we confronted him and he bolted through here. he must have collapsed the tunnel behind him. and he rigged an explosion to destroy any evidence that might have been here. this is where zaheer got in and out. aiwei was the traitor. i trusted him. is everyone okay. aiwei is a fugitive. get all available guards to search the mountainside. and find out where this tunnel exits immediately. what did you find. we located the end of the tunnel, but there's no sign of him. just some fresh tire tracks. he had an escape plan all ready to go. i trusted him with my life. i thought we were family, but it was all a lie. whoever these guys are, they're more powerful than we thought. and more dangerous. that's why we have to find them. we're going to hold off our search for airbenders and hunt down aiwei. naga can track his scent. and i bet if we find aiwei we'll find zaheer. no. we're not hunting this group. there could be other secret agents in other parts of the world looking for you right now. i'm taking you back to republic city where i can protect you. if i wasn't safe here, then i'm not safe anywhere. i have to stop them. it's too dangerous. you are not going. stop trying to protect me. i'm the avatar. this is my job. don't lecture me about jobs. enough. korra, listen to lin. but. they please. lin's only looking out for you. i promise you aiwei and everyone he's working with will be brought to justice. fine. if you really think it's best. i do. thank you, su. everyone should get some rest tonight. i'll have my people prep your airship and you can leave first thing in the morning. su. you really think naga could track aiwei. definitely. then here. there's a jeep packed with supplies by the east gate. it's all gassed up and ready to go. what. why. because i want you to hunt down aiwei and bring him back to me. but you said i said what lin wanted to hear, and i bought you guys some time. go. i'll deal with lin in the morning. let's get this guy. thanks. )
