earth fire air water. only the avatar can master all four elements and bring balance to the world. tensions between the northern and southern water tribes have reached a breaking point. after chief unalaq's troops took over the south, varrick incited an uprising. but korra stopped the rebels from abducting her uncle. enraged by the insurrection, unalaq arrested the rebels and korra's parents, accusing them of conspiring to assassinate him. will korra be able to save her parents and prevent civil war. you're making a mistake. i wish it hadn't come to this. but your parents held meetings with the rebels, right here in their home. i can't believe you're doing this to your own family. rest assured, i've appointed judge hotah to oversee the trial. he is the most fair and honorable man i know. uncle, my parents had nothing to do with the men who attacked you. i'm sure you're right. so we should have nothing to worry about. i hope so. where's varrick. we should've closed our deal an hour ago. would you relax. this place is great. and the best part about it. eska doesn't know i'm here. eeyah. i wasn't hiding. hey, heyhey, hey. i'm not on the hunt for you. currently. we search for varrick. our father wishes him to stand trial. what did he do. he is a traitor to the water tribe, along with our aunt and uncle. what. korra's parents were arrested. yes. your powers of deduction are impressive. yeah, he's a cop. varrick's not here. very well. desna, let us continue our search elsewhere. boyfriend. bow to me when i exit. yes, yes, my sweet koalaotter. you are so cute when you grovel. don't let her treat you that way. stand up for yourself. i tried to break up with her, but mako gave me terrible advice. thank you, mako. wait, how are your girl problems my fault. bolin, you need to be honest with her. tell her how you really feel. honesty is for fools, kid. varrick. if you want to ditch this girl, then make yourself scarce. disappear, like i did. where are you. somewhere unalaq will never find me. inside pingping. how we doin'. the coast is clear. you can come out. no way, mister. not until i know it's absolutely, 157% safe. ahh. thank you, zhu li. your assistant's in there too. zhu li never leaves my side. yuck. pyugh. pyuck. you forgot the honey. sorry, sir. there isn't any in here. no honey. we're in a bear, for crying out loud. i'm gonna go see how korra's doing. bolin, i got a little something for you 'round back. wow. now listen up. unalaq's rigged this trial, no doubt about it. so i need you to make sure my trusty rebels stay out of prison. what's the money for. bribery, of course. there's always someone willing to look the other way for a few yuans. i think i catch your drift, varrickbear. ikki. ikki, where are you. shoo. go bother someone else. you two are worse than kya and bumi. okay, everybody here. ikki. oh, thank goodness. juniper lightning bug, paws off the table. this is going to be a civilized breakfast. daddy always says a blessing before we eat, so be quiet and listen up. we are thankful for this super yummy food and for being the bestest new friends in the world. but we are most thankful because meelo and jinora aren't here because they stink. oh. hi, daddy. i guess you found me. do i have to go now. actually, is there room for one more. uh, sure. you can sit next to blueberry spicehead. nice to meet you, blueberry spicehead. and that's princess rainbow, and that's twinkle starchild. and that's juniper lightning bug. they're my new brothers and sisters. new ones, huh. can they be my new brothers and sisters too. maybe, but only if they say it's okay. uhhuh, uhhuh. no, no, he's nice. they say it's okay. we're good to go. i gave all the money to some guys over there. i told them to "take care of it," and then i winked. pretty sure they got the message. this trial will now come to order. judge hotah presiding. man. i should have paid him. yeah, you think. i was asleep in my chambers when the rebels attacked. they overpowered me, and the next thing i remember was waking up in the snow after avatar korra had saved me. according to unalaq's testimony, you attended a meeting where varrick tried to incite a civil war. is that true. yes. and were these men present at that meeting. well, yes, but and where exactly did this meeting take place. objection. quiet down out there. i'll ask you one more time. where did the meeting happen. my parents' house. and who led this meeting. your honor, if i may may what. may i declare a mistrial. sit down. varrick and your father led the meeting, didn't they. my parents are innocent. i've heard all i need to. i'll return shortly with my decision. hey there, eska. i was wondering if we could talk. i grant you permission to speak freely. oh, good, because i just need to be honest with you. you know, when we first met, there was this crazy spark. but i'm starting to feel like that spark is fading. i agree. it is as if a great chasm has formed between us and nothing can bridge it. oh. oh, yes. i am so glad you understand. nothing, that is, except marriage. we will wed at sunset. you may express your joy through tears. oh, no, i can't this is really tight. senna, please step forward. i have found you innocent. you are free to go. korra. on the charge of treason, you are all found guilty. the punishment for this crime is death. you can't do this. you take their lives, and i'll take yours. korra, calm down. i'll talk to him. i know i promised to respect whatever decision you made, but i must ask you to reconsider. show these men and my brother mercy. very well. i'll change their punishment. your lives will be spared. but you will live them out in prison. thank you, uncle. you like that, don't you, blueberry spicehead. yes, you do. you know, i could get used to it here. no one's yelling at me or telling me i'm delusional. we should have uncle bumi and aunt kya come visit. i bet they'd like it too. let's not. they'll only spoil our good mood. what do you mean. aunt kya is super nice and pretty and always asks me how i'm feeling. and uncle bumi is, like, the funniest person in the world. but what about meelo. he's hilarious too. you never know what's going to come out of his mouth. and jinora can be so sweet and gentle. and mean. and bossy. being part of a family is hard, huh, daddy. i couldn't agree with you more. but i guess the nice part about a family is they'll always be there for you. even though twinkle starchild and princess rainbow fight, they still love each other. that's very wise of you, ikki. we should probably head back, huh. i suppose. we can't hide in this cave forever. don't worry, daddy. we'll come back and visit blueberry spicehead. i know you really bonded with her. yes, i'd like that. honey, are you all right. i'm fine. good, then let's bust you out of here right now. korra, no. saving me would start a war. if fighting were to break out, the north would crush the south. i'll be all right. just promise me you won't do anything rash. fine. i promise. it's okay, mom. ii hate feeling so helpless. i know. oh. oh. what do you want. it's not about what i want. it's about what naga wants. and she'd like you to let my father out of prison. i i'm sorry, but there's nothing i can do. i was just following unalaq's orders. what are you talking about. i i've said too much. unless you wanna be naga's afternoon snack, you better keep talking. i i've worked for your uncle for years. he said he needed everyone to think the trial was fair. so unalaq told you what to say. yes. every word. then why did he have you free my mother and change your sentence. he's trying to keep you on his side. but he also wants your father out of the way. just like when he got your father banished. what do you mean "he got my father banished". nothing. keep talking. uh hey there, dad. you're looking well. look, uh, i'm sorry i didn't turn out to be an airbender like you hoped, but i've tried my best to keep the world safe. hope i made you proud. of course he'd be proud of you, bumi. kya. ii was just, uh cleaning off dad's statue. it's so dusty in here. come here. thanks, kya. you always know when i need a hug. unalaq's a liar and a traitor. i've been trying to tell you that from the getgo. what happened. i found out the truth about my dad's banishment. unalaq hired the barbarians to attack their tribe. then he told them to hide in the spirit forest, knowing my dad would go after them. unalaq wanted your dad out of the way so he could become chief. it was a setup. just like the whole trial. i can't believe i trusted him. i'm busting my father and the rebels out of jail. i need your help. if you do this, there's no going back. i know. will you help me or not. of course, i'll help. me too. count me in. i don't even want to know. so i'm guessing the breakup with eska didn't go well. no, no, the honesty thing worked out great. so great that she decided we should get married. sorry. i'm pretty sure the guy is supposed to give the girl the betrothal necklace. i guess eska didn't get the memo. look, the only way to deal with crazy women is to lie big and leave fast. lucky for you, varrick's got your back. now gather 'round pingping. let's talk plan. my dad's in there. where is he. i'm sorry, korra. you'll never see your father again. where's my father. on a ship headed to the northern tribe. he'll serve out his sentence there. bring him back or i'm taking you out and the rest of your army. remember who you are. as the avatar, you cannot threaten war. you must remain neutral, or our tribes will never find unity. you don't want unity. you want power. you've always been jealous of my father, haven't you. you got him banished so you could become chief, and i bet it just killed you to learn he was the avatar's father. no wonder you kept trying to take me away from him. all i've ever wanted is to help you realize your destiny. well, i don't want your help anymore. if you start a war, the dark spirits will annihilate the south. and even i will be powerless to stop them. i'm done being manipulated by you. you're going to bring my father back, then you and your troops will return to the north. and why would i do that. because you still need me to open the northern portal. no, i don't. you've served your purpose. aah. uh. if we get to varrick's boat, we can still save your father. let's go. you have a license for that animal. uh, you fella's seen a traveling circus come through here. zhu li, do the thing. that platypusbear is pooping money. where's your dad. on a ship headed north. think we can catch up to it. sure, once you get us past our friends from the north. if only we had a plane to get me close to those ships. i could waterbend them out of the way. a plane. well, why didn't you say so. um, why do you have a plane on your boat. in case the boat sinks, of course. but there's no runway. how are we supposed to take off. zhu li. take a note. build runway. yes, sir. i have an idea. now. captain, you are never gonna believe this. there. my dad's on that ship. jump. whooah. where are the prisoners. korra, this is crazy. you promised me you wouldn't do anything rash. i had to. i'll explain later. sweetie. you're okay. oh. i was so worried. do you have something you wanna say to your sister. ikki, i'm glad you're back. yeah, sorry we made fun of you. thanks. wanna play air ball. sure. yeah. i wanted to apologize for how i acted yesterday. i've worked so hard to celebrate dad's legacy that i may have overlooked the parts of him that were less than ideal. and we're sorry for dumping our frustrations with dad out on you. yeah, you didn't deserve that. i thought you two might wanna see this. mom gave it to me before we left. that is one goodlooking family, huh. that's one happy family. so once i knew the truth, i couldn't sit by and do nothing. my own brother betrayed me. and our entire tribe. what's our next move. i've been running from my past for too long. it's time to put my brother in his place. you have our support, chief tonraq. mine too. i'll be proud to fight alongside you, dad. no, korra. but you said the south doesn't stand a chance against unalaq's forces. i can help. the best way for you to help is by getting the president of the united republic on our side. the south can give unalaq a good fight for a while. but we'll need the united forces in order to win this war. all right, i'll get you all the help you need. i love you, dad. i love you too. i really need to thank you, korra. for what. i started a civil war. exactly. now eska and i are officially broken up. oh, looks like we have company. and not the fun kind. what is that. that would be my darling eska. is this thing fast enough to get away from my crazy waterbending exgirlfriend. why do you think i built this boat. )
