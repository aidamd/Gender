earth. fire. air. water. only the avatar can master all four elements and bring balance to the world. the earth empire has invaded the united republic. after kuvira demonstrated the power of her spirit energy weapon, president raiko surrendered the city, but the avatar refused to give up without a fight. korra held baatar jr. hostage, hoping to force kuvira to back down, but the plan failed, and she fired on team avatar's hideout. can anything or anyone stop kuvira and her mechagiant.  go ahead. take your time. just bending a giant wall. man, we got a lot of people here. is that everybody.   .   kuvira's heading our way with a platoon of mechasuits. what should we do. this is my hometown, and i hate to say it, but there's no use risking all our lives to fight that giant thing. let her take the city for now. we'll think of some way to come back and beat her. what about all the people who haven't been evacuated yet. if kuvira finds out wu is with them, she might fire that spirit cannon at him and take them all out. i couldn't stop kuvira from taking zaofu. i'm not letting her conquer republic city. the world isn't safe as long as she has that weapon. i agree. we take down that giant today. lin. glad to see you all made it out. you had me worried. well, you benders are gonna have to fight her alone. she just blew up our factory with all our hummingbird suits. not all of them. there are the prototypes back at my office. if we can get those ready to fly, we'll at least be able to offer a little air support. su, you take baatar jr. and the rest of the wounded back to asami's office. get those suits working as soon as you can. the rest of us will just have to face kuvira on our own.  everyone, please settle down. the trains should be returning to pick us up soon. tell that mechajerk to settle down. she's the one blowing up the whole city. i hate to be the bearer of more bad news, but i just heard on the radio that kuvira's army has destroyed the train tracks. we're not getting out of the city by rail. everyone, i was just up on the observation deck and saw a bunch of mechasuit soldiers heading this way. oh, great. the giant one wasn't enough. it's over. we're all gonna get blown to bits. listen, everyone. i can get us out of here if you just sit tight. can you step off the bench, please. it's a little crowded up here. sure. i'm only the conductor. no one needs me on the bench. just stay calm. i'll be right back. come on. whoa. whoa, whoa, whoa. where are you going. i'm going to get some help. you think you can handle this unruly mob for a little while. i raised meelo. i can handle anything.  . a paint store. that's it. what are you doing, meelo. i just got an idea how to beat the giant. now everyone, grab some paint and find me some balloons.  airbenders approaching. i see them.      . bombs away. clear the glass. now. the joints are platinum, too. we can't metalbend any of it. you're about to get the world's largest hotfoot, metal lady.  hit it now.  .       ah. ah.   ah. uh. uh.  opal.   everyone, retreat. take the wounded back to asami's office. i'll meet you there. i'm going to see if i can find help.   . all right. let's fire it up again.    i can't stabilize it. i thought you fixed the hydraulics. i did. twist harder.  ahahoh. i hope you have something in here that can take out a platoon of mechasuits. kuvira's troops are headed this way. i know how to take down some mechasuits, and it just might take down that giant, too. asami, disconnect anything electrical in here until we get back. zhu li, let's go. where am i. mom. just rest, son. i'm here. mom, i'm so sorry. i betrayed youthe whole family. i gave my life to kuvira, and she just fired that weapon at me. how could she do that. i don't know, sweetie. she's a complicated person. wing and wei will never forgive me. and opal yeah, they might take some time to come around, but we'll work through it as a family. do you think this plan will actually work, sir. i know i can stop the mechasuits with an electromagnetic pulse, so it stands to reason that i can stop a giant mechasuit with a giant electromagnetic pulse. zhu li, i've been thinking. you're always thinking, sir. yes, but lately, ' i've been thinking about you. i know we might not make it out of this mess, and i feel like there are some things i should tell you. there are. i remember when i was a boy, i had an ostrich horse. named her mrs. beaks. i grew up on a farm. did i ever tell you that, zhu li. this was before the circus people took me away. anyway, i loved old mrs. beaks, but i took her for granted. you'll have to finish your story later. kuvira's troops are in range. okay. i hope this works.    yes. dead in their tracks. oh, rats. she's still coming. zhu li, do the thing. i'm afraid there are no more things to do. what was that. an electromagnetic pulse. it shut down the mechasuits, but our power source is fine. locate the source of the pulse. that must be where varrick is. third and fourth mech platoons, move in and continue the sweep. capture anyone left in this city. varrick, how come your electrothingy shut down the small mechasuits but not the big one. because it's powered with spirit vine energy. i'm sorry. i wish i could help you, but it's unstoppable. it's not. dad. i got him out of jail to help. i figured we need all the geniuses we can get our hands on right now. if the prison's still standing after all this is over, we can throw him back in. i know what you all must think of me, but i love republic city, and i would do anything to save her. you think you know how to defeat this thing. you must act like an infection: break the skin and attack the vital organs. disconnect the heart and the brain, and this beast cannot live. but how are we supposed to get inside. future industries has plasma says for cutting platinum. if we had one on the mechasuit but the saws are way too big. we'd never get the suits off the ground. i think i can add an electrical element to the welding torch on your suit and convert it into a plasma saw. then we'll just have to land on the giant and cut open a hole big enough for someone to get in. like a metal mosquito. you know what happens to mosquitoes that land on me. i squash 'em. we'll have to attack in a swarm to try to keep you guys safe in the hummingbird suits. it looks like they're our only hope. . oh, first he ate the fruit . then he ate the leaves . hungry little lemur ate up all my trees . okay. great job, everybody. who's got another song for us. we can't just sit around here singing old airbender songs until we're all captured or worse. should we play the button game. who has a button.  where did these badgermoles come from. the zoo. mako always hated my singing, but they love it. well, what are we supposed to do with badgermoles. they're the best earthbenders around. we can use them to tunnel out of the city without kuvira's troops spotting us. are you sure this is the best plan. let's follow the moles. . badgermoles digging holes . . under republic city . got to run away from kuvira today . . although i do still think she's pretty .  mech platoons, report. third platoon. no sign of anyone so far. fourth platoon. en route to train station. i think we found the source of the electromagnetic pulse: future industries tower. that's the place.  kuvira is headed our way. how long will it take to get the plasma saws ready. just a few more minutes. get out there as soon as you can. if you do manage to get inside, find the engine room. there are two emergency levers. if you switch them off at the same time, you'll cut the power. thanks. we may not be able to beat that thing, but we can slow it down. let's go.  .       jinora.  whoa. ooh. rah.   . oh, yin . you're the sweetest evacuee i've ever known . . and i just want to thank you for being so kind . . when i was living in your home . halt. turn around slowly, and please, stop that singing. you are all earth empire prisoners. come with us and no one will get hurt. you don't need these people. they're just innocent civilians caught in the crossfire, but i'm prince wu, rightful leader of the earth kingdom. take me to kuvira. i've got business with her. no. don't do it, wu. i have to. but before i go, i'd like to sing you a song. . if you don't respect the broach . . you don't respect me . oh, no, no, no, no, no . you're no better than a roach . . but i'm royalty . i got my badgermoles with me . actually, your song is so bad, your badgermoles deserted you. . you don't know . what you're talking about   . oh, badgermoles i love you, i love you . . i want to, i want to pet your snouts . haha.    if we stop that mechagiant, it will all be because of you. you're the one who designed these incredible suits. it's great to be working together again. i love you, dad. i love you, too. zhu li. yes.  i have something i need to attach before we take off. attach to what. i need to attach this ring to your finger. zhu li moon, will you do the thing for the rest of our lives. yes. yes. now, let's go attach these barelyfunctional rust buckets to a giant killer smashing machine. it's exactly how i always pictured our engagement.   . aim for that spot in the middle of the back, the one i can never reach. got it. whaa. let's get out of here.  wow. i wish i had that kind of flexibility.  .  hang on. ah.  i need more power. they're cutting in. more power.   we need to get out of here. almost there.  we have to go now. almost there. almost there. dad. now. goodbye, asami. i love you. dad. hiroshi's plan worked. there's our opening.  )
