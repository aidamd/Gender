january, 1957 coast guard patrol boat 'souya', weighing 2497 tons has bypassed bad weather and is proceeding toward antarctica shouwa base, ongu island shouwa base is the first base being built by the japanese during their participation in the international geophysical year here we have all the first crosswinter expedition members and 19 karafuto dogs, including one female. in order to be successful in this campaign, the team is staying in antarctica during the winter. this is also a fight against the harsh nature of antarctica. hey, it's time to eat. here, riki. taro, here you go. good boy. here, jiro. here, kuma. hey, anko, taro. you guys are too spoiled. aren't you two supposed to be brothers. and you grew up in antarctica, too. i want to set out at the beginning of october. if we start too late, the ice might get too unstable. then we can't travel inland. but looking at that engine, we not really going to get far. the first car also needs to be fixed. ah, such poor performance. the second team might bring a better sled. because we've already told them what parts need to be upgraded. i really want to get to botnnuten. because you've already arrived at antarctica. i can understand your feeling. but looking at the observation team's previous missions, we've already accomplished what we wanted. hey, ushioda. what is it. how much baggage can a dog sled pull. well if we're looking at something really heavy, the standard should be around half the dog's weight. if we choose 15 really strong dogs, averaging 36 kilograms per dog, then that should be jiro 34. 5. all right. mr ushioda, which dog should we weigh next. taro. sure. let's take a photo with taro, quickly. here, taro. such a good boy. come on. okay, ready, come on. it's decided that dog sleds should be used to travel inland. the team will set off from the base on the 16th of october the strongest sled team possible. our goal is to arrive at botnnuten, which is at higher ground. the team will survey its actual position, its elevation, and its geology. akira ushioda is responsible for geology measurements and looking after the dogs. responsible for meteorology measurements, is ochi kenjiro, who will also look after the dogs. the one most experienced in mountaineering is ozaki taicho. these three have been chosen to be the team members. go go on riki, go, riki. go go let's go let's get moving. jakku, come on. we're almost there. keep going, it'll get easier once we get past this trough. good, doctor, keep pulling hard. are you okay. jakku. good good. jiro. good, hurry up, let's get moving. jiro, kuma. good good, let's make a stop doctor, how are you doing. ochi, if you don't change your socks soon you're going to get frostbite. of course. let's stop here we should already be on padda island by now. that's strange, what's that over there. it's a whale. it looks like the carcass has been pushed to the surface by the ice. god, what a mess. jakku, do you know what kind of noise this is. it's not the wind whistling, that's for sure. that sounds like ice blocks collapsing on each other. what is it, are you nervous. if you're worried by this, how are you going to cope with the journey ahead of us. the reason why i'm pushing you guys so hard, is that i'm hoping you'll become tougher. here it is different than japan. this is antarctica. only the strongest can survive. got it. i never expected such a hard trainer like you to have a soft side. oh come on, i was just woken by the doctor's horrible snoring. then i heard that guy whining outside. i just couldn't help myself. me too. if it wasn't for him, i wouldn't have heard that. the wind has picked up. go and check the guy lines. then go back to sleep. okay, have a good night. go go, riki, go on. riki seems a little off. good, let's stop here stop, now let's put jiro at the front to lead the team. sure. deri should stay back too. move kuma and taro to the front. right. go go go are you okay. i'm fine. stop here ochi. what is it. one of the dogs is bleeding. which one is it. it's taro. is it serious. not really. can't believe that jiro is hurt too. good, time to pull, move it. pull harder. come on, let's hurry up. let's start pulling. hurry and pull. let's get moving. good, stop here. let's stop here okay, stop all right, kuma's stronger. let's move him to the lead. it should be okay, shouldn't it. go let's stop. goro, what is it. aren't you the most experienced in the team. come on, let's push it. ochi. it's my turn. okay. time to go. get ready. pull pull pull okay, stop. good, we're going downhill from now on. ochi, let's go. excellent. doctor. okay. good, let's go. ochi, let's be careful. right. doctor. stop here goro, are you okay. it's all because you haven't run fast enough. hey, how are you doing. i'm fine. i wasn't asking you, i was asking the dogs. the dogs and i are fine. go come let's go let's stop it's time to eat. come on. hey, shiro, do you want some of this. go ahead and eat. thanks. this is our food. a young guy like yourself must be starving. damn, this is hard going. but it's okay, i can put up with it because this is antarctica, the land of my dreams. good, we're almost there. hey. yes. can you bring goro over here. of course. goro. goro's going. goro, goro's leaving. goro goro goro goro goro goro goro go goro what do you want. don't you know who's feeding you. come on. go goro. come on, let's go. come on, let's go, come on. come on, move. so useless. let's go. such a useless dog. goro goro, hurry up and come back. hurry up and come back. if you don't, we'll leave you. please, come back here. please, i beg of you. don't you remember who feeds you. please, i'm begging you. you get it now, don't you. you seem to understand me. come on, let's go. let's get on, follow my lead, goro. go go go go go go hurry hurry very good very good go what is it. botnnuten wait. this is something written by the students from hokkaido university, who were given the huskies for training and mr moriwa. let's put them all in. okay, that's good. on the road back from botnnuten, the expedition is surrounded by a very thick fog. in such a windless environment, their vision is entirely lost. the world becomes white. the eyes of the three team members are all damaged by strong ultraviolet rays. they contract snow blindness as a result. the expedition did not bring any radio transmitters due to weight constraints. they are as good as dead. hey, let's stop here. ochi, are you okay. yeah, i'm fine. i can't believe that the team has been stopped by snow blindness. how stupid of us. mr ushioda. what is it. can you see anything at all. only a bit. where are we now. we left almost two hours ago. i think we should be somewhere, like twenty to thirty kilometres away from the base. only if the dogs are on the right track. what can you see. nothing, the fog's too thick. can't really see anything. i was just thinking. what is it. we should cut taro and jiro loose here. right here. yes. i think if we let them go back to the base, chief ozawa will send us a rescue team. but the priority is that those two need to get back to the base safely. i think they'll be fine. do you really think so. mr ushioda. i understand your feeling, but i agree with ochi's opinion. if taro and jiro couldn't find their way, we would have been lost a long time ago. if that's the case, it would be the same if we let them go. it's decided, then. okay then, let's do this. taro, good. good, go on now. taro and jiro were brought to antarctica when they were puppies, a pair of siblings who grew up on the base. taro, jiro. mr ozawa. such good boys. ochl, is everything fine. his condition is serious. are you guys all right. ozaki, are you okay. i'm doing fine. why don't you guys ride the sleighs back to base. leave the dogs to us. we're hoping to get back to the base with the dogs all together. where's the souya, hasn't it arrived already. souya can't move, sir. mr ochi, are you okay. yes, i'm fine. my eyes are just stinging from the cigarette smoke. but isn't it great. you three are doing fine. hey, good news. shiro's just had pups. that's great. are they out already. still can't get too close to them yet. at the end of december, 1957. the souya entered the glacier carrying the second crosswinter expedition. but when the new year arrived, the weather had worsened considerably. the souya was stuck inside the pack ice and couldn't get close to the base. by february, the souya finally called the us icebreaker burton for help. sleigh. what did you say about the sleigh. burton, we are stranded and require urgent assistance. burton. you said burton, what is it. hello what is it with the burton now. magnetic storm again. yes. chief. did he mean that the burton is stranded in a dangerous area. it sounds like it. yes. am i hearing right. even the burton is unable to move. it looks like that this team isn't able to move either. taro i'll go and get him. good. wait a second. mr ushioda. if he goes on acting like this, the guy who is in charge of the dogs on the second team is going to have a hard time. good. alright. should we take a photo. yes or no. come on everybody, let's gather outside, the shouwa has arrived. we're safe now. hey. hurry up and lead the plane here. is it here. hey, we've been waiting a long time. hey. hey. we've waited long enough. it's here hey hey. great. mr nonomiya. this has been a rough year for you. i get to see you at last. how is mr horigome. he's fine. to be honest, it has been decided that everyone in this place needs to leave today. leave. you're not waiting until someone else takes over. this is the same as abandoning the base and retreating. this decision had been made after chief horigome, captain iwakiri and the planning headquarters discussed the issue. it's been decided. i'm sorry, but can you all please hurry. i'll be at your assistance. unfortunately, we can only withstand this type of weather for one day. we'll transport the equipment with a beaver plane. three of the team members will go with it at the same time. hasegawa and take will stay. and they'll be responsible for communication and machinery. please hurry and pack up, everyone. ikeuchi, why don't you go with them. sure. come on. good, it's decided then. act fast, there isn't much time. each person can only bring luggage up to 45 kilograms. okay. be good, boy. anko, i'll give you a treat. good boy. taro, anko. taro, hey. taro, anko. anko, come here. taro, even at the last minute, you're still giving me trouble. good, jiro, listen up. from now on you can't treat your new boss like you did to me or ochi. anko. anko, stop here stop here mr ushioda, you have to check these collars thoroughly. when the second team comes, it would be embarrassing if the dogs were loose. good point. good boy good you like to bite. can't really do that from now on. you must behave nicely like jiro. got it. be good. good. please act quickly. mr ushioda, please hurry up. mr. ochi. coast guard patrol boat souya us icebreaker burton thank you very much first and second observation team, assemble on the deck. the landing deck is ready. the plane has landed. thank you. please, please come over here. where are the dog handlers, mr tokumitsu and mr toda. the chances of the weather getting any better now look slim. my advice is that you should not stay for the winter. no way, we're here to replace the observation team. we're not giving up. kamikaze spirit. no, i'm afraid you're wrong. we're only saying that we'll try to make the most of the last chances we have, taking everything into account. these are such fine documents. a dog who likes to bite people. this one is the leader, riki. this one here's a loner, kuma. can i really keep these. sure, this is what the documents are for. really. thanks very much, i'll look after them. anything else i should be paying attention to. watch the collars. collars. yes, the collars should never be removed. hasegawa and take, i'm worried about you two. mr hasegawa, thank you for you work. thanks, i know it was tough work. seriously. really, thank you. i repeat, hurry up and take in shouwa. about the base how are the other dogs. the second observation team will proceed as planned. it's okay to leave the dogs there. how about their food. i left each of the dogs enough dried herring and sardines to last them a few days. this dog and her pups are pilots. we dumped the reserve fuel in order to bring them over. attention, at seven in the morning this ship and the burton will retreat to the open sea temporarily. once the weather gets better we will return to the glacier. the souya, which went to the open sea in order to evade the storm, is now back at the glacier, trying hard to bring the second crosswinter team to the base. the explosives are ready. do it. let's go back at full speed. engines at full speed. mr ushioda. i want to talk to you about the collars. we shouldn't have tightened their collars because of something like this maybe happening. if anko couldn't get his collar loose ochi. yes. it'll clear up, it should be in time. it'll clear up for sure. although you're so confident, these ice blocks are huge. they haven't broken up at all. engines proceed slowly. engines proceed slowly. it should be okay this way. attention, crew members of the souya and the observation team, i'm sorry to say that the weather is not getting better. in addition, the souya has reached its full capabilty. we must terminate the mission of the second crosswinter team. the shouwa base must be abandoned at once. at noon today, the souya will withdraw its mission regarding the glacier, and head back. like every one of you, i did my best to accomplish this mission. nevertheless, we have done all we can do. mr ushioda. all our efforts have been wasted. i'm sorry. we've been through everything together, we should encourage each other now, and go back to our country. captain. he's in the map room. captain, youyou're giving up on the dogs. ochi, please stop. we've done our best. please, two more trips. please let's go to shouwa two more times. then we can bring back all the dogs. it's impossible in this weather. then we'll fly there once. can we let the plane fly once more. flying once is not enough. the dogs' total weight exceeds 500 kilograms. i'm going anyway. i'll poison them. there's no other way to be responsible. your name is mr ushioda, right. if we don't terminate the mission today, then we're going against orders from headquarters. moreover moreover. this ship is short of fresh water. we can't waste any more fuel for the water generator. ushioda. the blades and the rudder are damaged. the souya is in a bad shape, and there is no more fuel. even returning to cape town is no easy task. please think sensibly. it's not fair to the crew members. drinking water. if there's no drinking water, then there's nothing left to do. mr ushioda. i i should give this back to you. actually, we're carrying something very important here. this is what the fans of sakhalin huskies all over the nation gave us to decorate the dogs' home. we're leaving. good. have a shave, it will freshen you up a bit. mr ushioda. there's nothing i can do. what do you think i can do. the first to break the chain was anko. the second one was jakku. then it was the leader, riki, who broke free from his collar. then came jiro. shiro was free at last. the loose dogs have returned to the base. brothers taro and jiro have always stayed together. riki and other dogs explored inside the base in order to look for people. besu, moku and the others also went down. the leader of the dogs, riki, brought anko, jakku, shiro and jiro outside of the base to look for food. kuma had taken off also. taro and kuma followed the tracks of their team. then jiro appeared. jiro came back because he did not want to leave taro.        the dogs tried hard to find food. the last one is here. deri broke free from the chain at last. he followed his team. then they all came together. the chasms of the glacier are everywhere on the ice field. from these gaps we can see the darkness of the sea. these gaps open and close according to the currents of the sea. the creatures in the water will be pulled up to the ice field because of this force. there they would freeze. riki and kuma, both knew that. however, the edges around the gaps are very dangerous.   early summer department of geology, hokkaido university people are so stupid in japan. they know nothing about antarctica and the dogs but they still talk like that. saying things like 'what a pity'. how tedious. and you you shouldn't have given into such foolish whining. what are you going to do now you've quit this job. i haven't decided yet. do you want to go to australia. it's just it's the geology department in melbourne. you can go there for a couple of years, for a change of pace. i appreciate that, sir. all right, i understand if you knew a way to loosen up, you wouldn't have left the university. antarctica in may. it's a short rest for the dogs. anko and shiro became very close. mirages appear in antarctica often. under riki and kuma's lead, taro and jiro have learned how to catch seals. seals and penguins have travelled far to the frozen fields. winter has arrived in antarctica. riki tracked the footprints, and ran inland. it was the path they had taken on the expedition to botnnuten. however, kuma likes running alone. so he stayed at the gap. in antarctica, the sun does not appear from may to july. the whole continent becomes dark and hostile. the aurora australis makes an appearance in the antarctic sky. it's disturbing to the dogs. the pack stayed close together. all of a sudden jake got up and ran off. the loner, kuma, looked up to the sky. jake left his pack, he stood alone on the huge glacier. july, gion festival department of geophysics, kyoto university please come in. i'm sorry for being late. are you still working. do we really have to go. it'll be so crowded. but i didn't go last year. was that my fault. you think it wasn't. you ran off to the end of the world. was that not your fault. anyway, we should get moving. god, hurry up and get ready. if you don't listen to me, i'm not gonna marry you. it's there i can see it there. the japanese halberd is there. it's beautiful. little p, see the japanese halberd is here. look. little p, that's the japanese halberd. see. go have a look you look like a dog lover. because dogs know a dog lover when they see one. little p, right. let's go. what's wrong. hey. is it true, sir. what. the hottest days in japan are the coldest days in the antarctic. please stop that. didn't i tell you he doesn't like to talk about antarctica. actually, that's true. but how do you know that. no way. don't touch that. don't change the subject, okay. how did you find out. oh no. it's very hot now, but people claim that it's winter in the south. i just don't understand that. yeah, this is it. it's all this book's fault. that's the article i read. feeling guilty about leaving the huskies, ushioda is travelling to apologise to the families that reared the dogs. he sacrificed himself for such a great mission, i think he died a noble death. although it is a pity, i wouldn't blame anyone for it. thank you for making this trip. i should go. thank you for coming. please accept this. please take care of it. by the way i want to ask you something and i hope you can be honest. please go ahead. when you last saw riki, what was he doing. riki belonged to me and my sister. my sister is not here at the moment. i think when she gets back, she would ask me for sure. riki and the rest of the dogs were chained together. chained. i'm terribly sorry. that's riki's grave, my sister made it. i don't want any other dog. riki won't come back even if you gave me another puppy. i won't accept other dogs. why did you leave riki and come back by yourself. why didn't you bring him back with you. i hate you. hate you. give me back riki. maki, what are you doing. stop it. we've decided not to raise another dog. so please take that dog back. maki, it's okay now, let's go home. all of sudden riki started to run wildly because there remained the smell of humans. this was the storage depot of the expedition to botnnuten. some leftover meat was found. the one who fell was shiro, he was very close to anko.  now the mayor will say a few words. the sakhalin huskies, who were sacrificed in honour during the exploration of antarctica, were born here, in hokkaido and raised in this town. furen's kuma, kio's anko. they were trained the same way as the others. hokkaido is very proud to have these 15 puppies as friends. they are not only the pride of hokkaido, they are the pride of japan. we are now doing this for our friends mr ushioda. the europeans are very concerned about those 15 dogs too. i'm sorry. would you let us interview you. please answer some questions for us. i'm sorry. mr ushioda, since you quit your job at the university, you have been giving speeches about the dogs, right. is that because of the guilt brought on by the fact that you left these dogs in antarctica. what do you mean by guilt. those dogs were our partners. but what became of them at last. you chose to abandon them to die in such a cruel way. what do you make of that. you're right. we should have killed them with our own hands. goodbye. why aren't you talking. don't you have something to tell me. yes. the reason i came to hokkaido is because there is something i have to tell you in person. however, i changed my mind when i just saw you. why's that. the reason is we're the same. feeling regret for something we did, or trying to pretend not to care. feeling regret for something we did. does it sound familiar. does it. remember. when we were on our way to botnnuten. yes. you don't remember. is it a whale carcass. that looks like it. i wonder which of the dogs had ran off inside. i reckon it would have been jiro. maybe jiro. would anko and kuma be inside as well. no, it would be riki. riki. if it was riki, he must have led the others there. yes, he must have. ochi. yes. do you think they're still alive. what do you think, mr ushioda. at that time, riki, taro, jiro, and anko were all that remained. the dogs were were leaving the ice inland and heading towards the glacier. they were feeling fatigued. the appearance of the skuas meant that the hard winter had ended. however, nature did not greet these dogs warmly. a killer whale made a surprise attack. riki protected taro and jiro. taro and jiro came back because they would not leave riki. it was riki who showed taro that they could find seal carcasses near the crevice. riki fought for his life. he could not make it.  anko's ice floe was floating inland. good afternoon. good afternoon, miss. is that the puppy you brought to my home before. yes. it's grown up, what's his name. it's riki. riki we've decided we'd like to raise another dog. is that so. riki must be thrilled. riki wait for me, riki. riki. riki. riki was raised on kio island. once winter gets there, the dogs would be left on the island. but people will come back for the winter. the dogs would have to go and find food for themselves. they would survive. therefore riki must be surviving on his own also. because he is a diligent dog. even if he can survive on kio by himself, you can't compare kio with antarctica. i think so. it's impossible for all of them to survive. however, recently i've felt that a few of them may be able to survive. that's what i think. but the temperature in antarctica gets to forty below. even fifty. karafuto dogs can withstand cold weather very well. riki will probably find food on his own. i hope so. that's encouraging. up till now, i've still been regretting that we didn't kill the dogs. but that would be wrong. because that's not the way life is supposed to be. all lives are equal. no one has the right to end the lives of those dogs. it took me such a long time to understand that. springtime arrived in antarctica. for taro and jiro, who grew up in antarctica, the base is their home. kuma brought another dog with him. it was anko who was taken inland on an ice floe. anko met kuma who stayed at the chasm. and so he survived. the three dogs then followed kuma to hunt for food.  only three huskies remained.  kuma had once again disappeared on the other side of the island. taro and jiro couldn't bear to leave the base, their home. why are you looking worried. at least twelve people would form the third crosswinter expedition team would you go without telling me. no. how can i leave you again and go to the ends of the earth by myself. even if i go, it would only make me sad. so does that mean that you still haven't joined the team. hurry you should get to tokyo now. you should be able to make it if you go now. i'll wait for you. you should go to antarctica and see for yourself. then you can decide to choose me, or leave me. please stay around, mr ushioda.  ochi, that's jakku. i'm sorry. can we go around that mountain once more. captain, what did you see. hurry up and get to the shiowa base. mr ushioda, the supplies will be shipped immediately after investigating the base. can you please give this up. mr ushioda. goro. it must be the lack of food. ochi. kuma. no, it's taro and jiro. hey. taro. jiro. good boys. taro. the team brought back seven of the dogs' bodies: goro, besu, moku, aka bochi, kuro, and kuma. six dogs disappeared in the glacier: riki, anko, shiro, jakku, deri and kuma. taro and jiro survived. )
