earth. fire. air. water. only the avatar can master all four elements and bring balance to the world. the red lotus has captured the avatar. korra gave herself up in exchange for the airbenders. but zaheer doublecrossed her while ghazan trapped team avatar in the temple. all seemed lost until bolin saved their lives by lavabending. but he's not the only one with new skills. zaheer unlocked the ancient airbending ability of flight. will team avatar save the air nation and korra before it's too late. __ when i get out of here, none of you will survive. you won't get out. unless the metal clan taught you a way to bend platinum. once we administer this poison, your body will naturally react, forcing you into the avatar state in an effort to keep you alive. sadly for you, you'll be entering it for the last time. no. the avatar cycle yes. when we dispatch you in the avatar state, the cycle will end. so we lucky few, this band of brothers and sisters in anarchy, are witnessing the beginning of an era of true freedom. together we will forge a world without kings and queens, without border or nations, where a man's only allegiance is to himself and those he loves. we will return to the true balance of natural order. and though you will never again be reborn, your name will echo throughout history. korra, the last avatar. did you find any way to escape. no, not yet. but don't worry. we'll find a way out soon. they might not make it that long. korra will come to save us, right. i think we're going to have to do this on our own. administer the poison. ah. ahh. get ready. as soon as she's in the avatar state, take her out. wait. why isn't she staying in the avatar state. give it time. she can't resist for long. the place where i saw them taking the airbenders is around here. that's gotta be where they took korra. that's it. down there, lefty. find the airbenders and my family. don't worry. i'm not coming out without our children and the rest of your people. it's working. i told you, korra. the world doesn't need you anymore. the time of the avatar is over, korra. give up. you're too weak to resist and i'm stronger than ever. there's no use fighting. let go. let go. let go. let go. i'm thirsty. i gotta go pee. me too. hey. keep it down over there or you're all going to end up like them. sir, please. could we just have some water. there are children and a baby here. ah. oh, so you just called me over to attack me. fine. now nobody gets any water. ah. i don't know how we ended up here in day care while everyone else gets to watch the avatar being destroyed. i can hold a bowl of poison. hey. what do you think you're doing. ah. mom. oh, honey, i'm so glad you're safe. oh. me too. you're alive. i can't believe it. why. just because i was blown out of the sky and fell hundreds of feet down a cliff. don't you know it takes more than that to get rid of me. we have to get these two out of here now. they don't look so good. what are you talking about. i feel great. you guys get everyone out of here. i'll search for korra. we're going with you. you don't have to search for her. i know exactly where she's being held. now. destroy the avatar. ugh. ah. korra. we have to help her. look out. you help korra. we got this. daddy. oh, thank goodness you're all right. honey, are you okay. i'll be fine. we have to help korra. ah. what are you smiling about. i was just remembering the last time we fought. well, a lot has changed since then. so that's how you got out of the temple. not bad. let's see what you've got. you can't fight me and the poison. i can fly up on my bison to help her. you'd never be able to keep up with zaheer. he's too powerful. we have to do something. how can he fly like that. he's unlocked powers of airbending that haven't existed for thousands of years. there haven't been this many airbenders in one place for a long time, either. we have power together. hurry. everyone form a circle. follow me. ah. you have no water. it's over. not yet. now it's over. ah. give up, ghazan. you can't win. i'm never going back to prison. if i'm going down today, you're coming with me. mako, hang on. ah. ah. the poison has done its work. the avatar cycle will be over momentarily. ah. ah. korra, sweetheart, it's me, dad. please hang on. what are you laughing about. you're too late. the poison's been in her system too long. the red lotus has won. you can save her. the poison is metallic. dad. you're alive. i'm here for you. i'm never going to let you go. no. no. you don't understand. the revolution has already begun. chaos is the natural order of you see what i did there. i put a sock in it. literally. classic bolin. i do what i do. there you go. all fixed up for a formal avatar appearance. take a look. it's great. thanks. you know, nobody expects you to bounce back right away. it's only been two weeks. you need time to heal. i want you to know that i'm here for you. if you ever want to talk, or anything. but let's just try to enjoy this today. for jinora. you're right. okay. let's go. you look beautiful, sweetie. you're looking stronger every day, korra. i'd like to officially welcome you back to republic city. i know that the last time we saw each other it didn't end on the best terms, but i want to thank you for taking down those red lotus terrorists. we should go inside. i can help. i wanna ride with korra. jinora's already inside. it smells like shoe trees. sandalwood, meelo. i got this. hang in there, kid. she's not looking good. neither would you if you'd gone through what she had. she'll be fine. she just needs time to heal. the poison took a great toll. of course. i'm just saying, with the earth kingdom in complete disarray since the loss of the queen and even with zaheer locked up again, we still don't know how many red lotus members might be out there, hiding. exactly. with the world getting more and more dangerous, we need the avatar now more than ever. who will protect us while she's in a wheelchair. jinora, come forward. today we welcome the first airbending master in a generation, and i couldn't be more proud of my daughter. when the existence of our people was threatened, when the avatar's life hung in the balance, jinora never gave up hope. thanks to her leadership, i see a very bright future for the air nation. of course, there would be no air nation without avatar korra. she opened the portals and somehow the world began anew for us. and she was even willing to lay down her own life in order to protect ours. there's no way we can ever repay her for all she's done. but we can follow her example of service and sacrifice. so while she recuperates, the air nation will reclaim its nomadic roots and roam the earth. but unlike our ancestors, we will serve people of all nations, working wherever there is corruption and discord, to restore balance and peace. avatar korra, i vow that we will do everything in our power to follow in your footsteps and bring harmony to the world. now, let us anoint the master who will help lead us in our new path. )
