 well, there's only one thing i'm saying loha" to, relaxing.  and taking a break from trying to bust phineas and ferb.  what. it's hard work.  come on, kids, let's check out the gift shop while your father checks us in.  well, i'm a little rusty on my hawaiian, but here goes.  , hey, where's perry.  aloha, agent p.  i see you were able to subliminally persuade your host family to take their vacation in hawaii.  i still have no idea how you managed to do that.  okay, i'll decide where we'll go on vacation as soon as i clean out perry's litter box.  hey, how about hawaii.  as you know, doofenshmirtz is in the area of the big island.  he's obviously up to no good.  find out what he's up to and put a stop to it.  carl: sir.  oh, i promised carl you'd get him one of those hula wigglers for his dashboard.  he thinks it would be "neat".  hey. what's this.  pineapple scented serenity lotion with spf.  "apply and feel instantly serene." mom, i totally need a serenity lotion.  check this out. "aqua primates." aprimes, ferb.  the back of the box shows them crowning the queen, fighting robots and designing websites.  ferb, we totally got to get this.  hey, not to be redundant, but where's perry.  . perry .  perry the platypus.  well, first of all, i just want to state, for the record, that this island was not my first choice.  i wanted skull island right over there, but it was already booked for jake abernstein's bar mitzvah.  and so, all that was availablewas pink unicorn island.  so, go ahead, laugh it up.  i will say this, it was considerably cheaper than skull island, and look, i get to keep the robe.  oh, where are my manners. aloha.  that's hawaiian for "you're trapped." and why am i here, you ask.  see these little minivolcanoes, they contain a certain primordial ooze that i need for my latest evil device.  behold, the deevolutionator.  i don't know why, it kinda looks like a giant fish bone, that's just how it came in the kit.  when i unleash this baby on the tristate area, it will make every man, woman and child to moonwalk backwards down the evolutionary chain, finally stopping at wimpy little pliopithecus.  "oh, i'm pliopithecus. i'm not evolved enough "to stop a modern man like doofenshmirtz."  and that's when i will swoop back into town and take over.  isn't that just darwin.  candace: preparing to relax.  boy, do i need this.   why are there so many people here.  wait, wait, one last chair.  excuse me, i was here first.    relaxation.  come to me, serenity.  okay, well, the aprimes hatched, but they're really tiny.  and it looks like they can only do one trick, moving towards a light source.  as impressive as that is, i bet if they were humansized, they could do all this stuff on the box.  hmm. ferb, do we have any more of that growth elixir.  phineas: hey, candace.  phineas, i don't care if it's a ferris wheel to jupiter or a bionic meatloaf, i'm going to relax. now, go ahead, run along.  okay, ferb, time to dump 'em in.  hey. what are you two kids doing.  we're putting our aprimes in the pool before they outgrow their container.  is that against the rules.  well, let's see. "no running, diving, pushing or modern expressionism." nope, nothing here. you guys are good to go.  cool. let's add the aprimes.  . come along with me, my friends . we're going where the party never ends . here, underneath the sea . an tic jubilee . where my hands are like prunes . eating mussels from a spoon . do the aprime calypso with me . their underwater kin are maritime...  . do the aprime calypso with me . now, don't you be a wimp grab some driedprawn shrimp . and mix it with some h20.  . put it in a beaker or maybe in a sneaker . watch the aqueous primetime show.  . where my hands are like prunes . eating mussels from a spoon . do the aprime calypso with me . their uter kin are maritime...  . do the aprime calypso with me . hear the real rockers straight from davy jones' locker . do the aprime calypso with me . do the aprime calypso with me .  all right, candace, you're finally doing it.  relaxing, it's all good.  aloha, malihini, or guests.  in the spirit oflaulea, or peaceful relaxation, let me be yourkumu, or teacher in an outdoor yoga class, free for hotel guests.  pathetic, isn't it.  some people don't have the discipline to relax on their own.  they need to take a... oh, who are you kidding.  you're taking the class.  a little extra serenity can't hurt.  oh, this stuff is slippery.  everybody, find mat.  so let's start with a gentle standing back bend.     uhoh. improbable creature wrangling time.  i knew it. i knew my obnoxious brothers will ruin my relaxation.  shoo. shoo. get out of here. it's not a real fish.  as i was saying, the deevolutionator will blast past the pacific ocean, bounce off the satellite, and completely blank at the tristate area, deevolving everyone.  how are we doing in the back row. can you see okay.  all right, away we go.  oh, for badness sake, what now.  oh, i see, it's just a little smear on the lens. if i just...    excuse me, excuse me.  hey, mister, have you seen a group of giant, wetaqua primates running through here.  elevator. thanks.  hey. you two are so busted.  hold it right there, young lady.  i'm the manager of this hotel, and if there's going to be any busting to do, i'm going to do it.  but, but, but, but...  wait a minute, i am on vacation.  he is working.  i pass the bust baton to you, sir. aloha.   phineas: come back here. stop.  stop right there, young men.  what is the meaning of this.  uh, i'm not sure i understand your question.   stop. come back here.  wow, for someone living in hawaii, he's awfully stressed.   okay, this, i don't even get.   all right, candace, you're finally doing it, relaxing.  manager: come back here.   stop.  how are we gonna round up the aprimes.  hello. room service.  boys. i'm going to call your mother.  5550142.    hello, you've reached linda flynnfletcher.  and if this is candace, i'm sure whatever the boys are doing is nothing.   hon, dr. goldberg and his old lady are trying to drop in on our wave.  ooh, those crazy kooks.  i'll just do an oldschool dropknee turn on the bottom, eh.  cut back up the face through the soup, do a nice little tail slide, and drop into the green room for a bit of tube time.  you got all that on the internet, didn't you.  yes, yes, i did.  cowabunga.  what. what is it.  oh, great. now, i'm a singlecelled organism.  now how am i gonna drive home.  you boys order a giant flashlight from room service.  yep. you're in luck.  we were just about to take that off the menu.  here. let's switch this baby on.  hopefully, the aprimes haven't forgotten their one trick.   it's working. they're moving towards the light.  are you mrlynnfletcher.  yes.  your boys are doing something in the back, and you have to see it.  no, wait. don't throw that out.  oh, curse you, perry the platypus.  perfect, they're still here.  come quick, come, look.  see. look at these slimy, disgusting creatures.  well, that's not a very nice thing to say.   hi, mom. hi, boys.   yeah.  but, but, but, but, but there were all these...  my apologies if my daughter put you up to this.  we'll be upstairs, kids.   oh, dude. i know, right.  oooooo99uefrrrrrrrtllhhhhhhhb46 i'm starting to get the hang of it.  i think this motionrefers to the swaying of the palm trees.  oh, yeah. and this motion says, this brit can movie it.  i wonderhow the boys are doing.   nicely done, bro. we are becoming quite the islanders.  oh, jeremy, i must be the luckiest girl in hawaii.  what is that.  ooh, a good luck charm..   ...with its own theme music.  who would have guessed that my deevolutionator would backfire on me.  all right, put your pseudopods down.  hey. what's that.  my deevolutionator right here on the ocean floor.  if it's still working, i could throw it into fastforward and evolvinate back into my former wickedness.  ah, it's a good thing i installed this molecular scale control panel.  it seemed frivolous at the time, but i'm glad i did it.  and...    it's strange that underwear and socks evolved with me.  aloha,bros.  hey, candace, cool necklace. where did you get it.  oh, you like it. it's my lucky charm.  it was delivered to me by tranquil hawaiian waves.  what are you up to.  well, we've done our share of terrainbased activities, so we're gonna try some semiaquatic endeavors.  cool. speaking of semiaquatic, where's perry.  agent p, we still don't know the current whereabouts of dr. doofenshmirtz, but we're picking up a strange signal from the island of wa ta lotta hoie.  it could be emanating from the missing deevolutionator.  you'd better investigate. good luck, agent p.  carl, more ice.  coming, sir.  with the deevolutionator back in my hands, i can reverse the settings and i'll have the most highly evolved brain on earth.   now that i'm so smart, i don't think this was such a good idea.  oh, my precious little good luck charm, i'm so glad i found you.     well...   if this wasn't meant to be, someone give me a sign.  no, no, no, no, no.  well, that's good enough for me.  this single guy is out. peace.  oh, my gosh, i could've been killed.  i'm so glad i had my lucky charm.  you totally saved my life.    well, i guess that could've been a lot worse.  but thanks to my lucky charm, i guess...   no worries, i've got my lucky charm on.       well, i guess it could've been worse.  okay, that does it. this thing is totally bad luck.  well, little amut, this girl doesn't need any more misfortune.  so byebye, bad luck.   over it.    please hold me. how do i get rid of this.  you must take it to the island of wa ta lotta hoie to the top of the volcano and...  of course. it can only be destroyed in the fire from which it was formed.  hold on, volcano. i'macomin'.  we work for tips, you know. and she's gone.  hey, i need a ride to that island of wa ta lotta hoie.  sure. just grab that towline.  towline. do you mean...   hey, wait. why is this happening to me.  no more bad luck.    wow, sis. way to hang loose.  cowabunga, kids.  laird hamilton.  last i checked.  say, aren't you dudes a little young to be riding this kind of surf.  no worries, bro.  we're just gonna hot dog this honker past the boneyard to the sand.  you got that off the internet, didn't you.  yes. yes, i did.  all right then. hang loose, kooks.  later, wahine.  hang ten, waterman. see you on shore, candace.  i'm doomed.   i'm cursed. phineas, ferb, i need your help.  i can't get rid of this tiki charm.  uh, personally, i'd be a little more worried about that manta ray stuck to your head.  what. oh.  you know, with the day i've been having, i didn't even notice.  here, candace, let us get rid of it for you.  that won't work. every time i try to get rid of it, my luck gets even worse.  no worries, candace.  see. nothing. no bad luck. perfectly fine.  but, but, but, but...  wow, let me give you a hand.  looks like you could use le luck.  here. i found this on the beach.   later, dawgs.  later, brah.  see. it's back.  what can we do to help.  we need to get to the top of that volcano and throw it in.  well, all right then. i know what we're gonna do today.  being stranded on the deserted island is much easier with a normalsized head.  oh, i got something. it works. i found a plus.   perry the platypus.  just because we're stranded on a deserted island doesn't mean we should abandon our normal lives, don't you think.  because then, the tiki gods would win.  so i made myself supreme ruler of the tricoconut area when no one was looking.  it stretches all the way from that big rock over there, where i'm drying my socks and undies to those tee coconut trees at the end of the beach.  and i have my minions.  look, if they don't obey, i eat them.  what's that look. oh, you're looking at the deevolutionator.  is that why you're here.  well, don't worry about that.  i had to disable it. it was doing bad things to my head, man.  i keep it around for the crabs.  they really seem to like it.   i know, weird, huh.  hey.  okay, fine. go it alone. see if i care.  but keep your little webbed feet away from my...   oh, you're so going to be crab cocktail.   . when the day began, you had the wind in your sail  . things were going your way, you thought you just couldn't fail . now you're walking around like you're under a curse . and you don't know how this day could get any worse . bad luck . the dark cloud you're standing under . bad luck . bad luck . well, you can try and try . but bad luck is gonna get you and you don't know why . bad luck . could it be any clearer.  . bad luck . it's like you just broke a mirror . bad luck . did you walk under a ladder.  . 'cause your luck was just bad but it's getting badder . bad luck .  oh, perry the platypus. i've drawn a line in the sand, and you are not allowed to cross this line.  ooh, refreshments. where did you get that.  could i have some.  what, the line. oh, no, look.  i was just kidding about... look, look, look...  it's not a real line, it's not a barrier.  oh, come on.  oh, perry the smartypus.  behold the sandinator.  i'll bet you're wondering what it does, huh.  huh.  well, it's easy, it causes gritty, irritating sand to wedge itself into your swim trunks causing you to chafe and get a rash and have a lousy day at the beach.  how do you like... ha. you don't wear trunks.  what is that, a european thing.  oh, hey, it works. i have sand in my trunks and it's really irritating.  i may be starving and dying of thirst, but at least i've got my hovel.  what has he got. nothing.  he's a platypus. they've got like webbed fingers and no opposable thumbs. practically flippers.   wait. wai. wait, those are my minions.   traitors.  are we there yet. for safety's sake, i think ferb and i should check out the scene before you go up.  okay, yeah, whatever you say.  i'm not taking any more chances.   what's taking them so long.  phineas. ferb.  oh, no.   huh.  hey, candace.  candace: mom.  check it out, candace. there's tons of these.  hey, wahine. looks like you took the long way.  most people just take the escalator, you know.   no, no. i can't handle any more bad luck.  that's not bad luck. that just means your table's ready.  t's see what other luck it brings you.   ah, looks like someone's getting a free dessert.  huh.  no way. i don't want anything that necklace brings me.  goodbye. good riddance. candace is out. peace.  i'll take that free dessert if you're not gonna eat it.  no, thanks.  i'm just glad i got rid of that bad luck.  i've got to get off this island.  what i need is a "boat." or boat, as i'm now been told it is pronounced.  oh, look, a boat... a boat.  perry the platypus, i've decided that our efforts would be better spent if we work together, to get off the island.  here, let me help you with that.  hah, you won't mind if i borrow your boat.   nice work, agent p.  agent w will take it from here.   rubber ducky is in the water. over.  what do you say, we get something i hear there's a great restaurant on the other side of the island, and i found one of these.  maybe we'll get a free dessert.    there you are, perry.  ..vffvfvffvfvffrrrlrlrrllha, ha. so long, perry the suckerpus.  look after my minions, those little traitors.  oh, for crying out loud.  agent w .   listen up, both of you. let's get one thing straight.  i am supreme rulerof this place and don't you forget it.   )
