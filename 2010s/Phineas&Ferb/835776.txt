 this biosphere can simulate almost any environment.  phineas: can we cook or can't we.  you guys are the greatest.  okay, according to the fireside girl handbook, we can find water in cacti.  now don't make it too easy.  hi, candace.  what do you say to a little picnic.  you know, indoors.  neat.  we can't let a little rain put a damper on our...  wow. i guess your brothers have been busy, huh.  oh, we should have our picnic in there.  um, um, excuse me.  urge to bust so strong.  but i need time with jeremy to find out why he likes me.  got to resist urge to bust.  must not spoil quality time with boyfriend.  uh, picnic in the dangerous, unauthorized and highly bustworthy biosphere.  sounds great.   so, we've gotten water from a cactus, witnessed a mirage, and learned the difference between sunstroke and heat stroke.  thanks for that, addyson.  hey, the salamanders quit singing.  now we just need to either collect a sand sample, measure the temperature, or milk a camel.  you guys.   wow. i set up this whole thing with lasers and flypaper, falling cages, spinning platforms on the way to a trapdoor, and you just come and slip on a chair and waste a day's worth of work.  ah, but it's gonna look great on the christmas party gag reel.   of course, it'll just be me at the party. yeah.   yeah...  i need a laugh at the holidays.  anyway, gotcha.  go ahead, try to climb out of it.   it's greased.  so, now that you're all comfycozy, i can introduce you to my raininator.  i've been using it to pour millions of gallons of water into these clouds, causing it to rain all over the tristate area.   i can't believe nobody's noticed it.  it's kinda obvious.  yay. we made it across the desert.  say, phineas, i don't suppose you can help us out with our rainforest navigation patch.  no problem, ladies. ferb.  well, this sure beats all that rain.  not too hot, are you.  no, no, not at all.  i mean, isn't that what you said you liked about me.  that i don't overheat.   no.  the thing i really like about you is...   wow, this is incredible.  um, uh, what was that you were saying.  i said this is incredible.  no, before that.  i said, "wow."  pardon.  sure.  hmm.  hey, i think i found a new species of...   here, addyson, catch this.  swift water rescue patch. bonus.  candace.  yes.  check it out: this umbrella makes a sweet raft.  you wanna float down the river with me.  busting. boyfriend.  busting. boyfriend.  busting. boyfriend.  coming.  so i bet you're wondering, why did i cause all this rain.  you see, while perusing local garage sales, i came upon a big screen tv from 1985.  but when i went to turn it on, it was stuck on the spanish channel.  all it played was crazy variety shows and mexican soap operas.  i really got hooked on one of them though, el matador de amor.  it has these three simultaneous storylines that interconnect.  genius.  anyway, the last episode was a cliffhanger in which esmerelda is going to find out why juan loves her.  at least i think that's what's going to happen.  but the show got preempted by a soccer game.  oh, i hate soccer.  it makes no sense whatsoever.  the clock runs up instead of counting down.  what is that.  so with the help of my raininator, i rained the game out.    and now back to our regularly scheduled programming.   in 10 minutes the show's gonna start.  and with you trapped and the raininator at work, nothing will interrupt me.   hey, less pounding back there, okay.  i mean, you're lucky i sprang for the clear tube.  this way you can watch, too.  i mean, it's like your hair was genetically engineered to ensnare those giant fruit bats.  and you like that about me.  it's certainly interesting, but it's not what i like about you.  what then.  well, let me put it into song.  . all throughout history, men fall in love with women . you wanna know why, well, let's start from the beginning . i've come to set the record straight . i've come to set the record straight . from scientific propagation of the species . to poets and philosophers, your baudelaires and nietzsches . i've come to set the record straight . i've come to set the record straight . but if you're asking for specifics . well, this isn't hieroglyphics . if you wanna know sincerely . listen up, i'll tell you clearly . what i like about you is...   so, you were saying.  oh, yeah.  . i've come to set the record straight . i see you still don't get it . but you really shouldn't sweat it . i'll say it one more time with feeling . here's the reason you're appealing . what i like about you is...   . what i like about you is...   not again.  . what i like about you is... .   keep your toes in.  hey, guys.  uhoh. here comes the fun part.  "fun part".  seriously.  jungle navigation patch: complete.  anybody up for a little rock climbing.  behold, mount ferbious.  sorry, addyson.  the salamanders are back.  who wants a concussion first aid patch.  candace: incoming.    hey, look, candace, i'm making snow angels.  i'm wet and i'm freezing cold.  ah, it's not so bad.  i mean, we're together aren't we.  well, yeah...  eek. whoops.  and being together like this makes me realize what i like about you.  what. what.   what's that sound.  that could have squished us.  that's it.  i'm gonna bust them.  wait, candace.  look, it's just papermache.  good job, everyone.  i think we've earned our rock climbing patches.  congratulations, ladies.  how do you feel about nonpowered flight patches.   ferb: marvelous.   hey. get back here.  i'm gonna bust you two if it's the last thing i...    announcer: el matador de amor.  it's starting.  it's starting.  okay, now, perry the platypus, shh.   i don't wanna miss anything.    help me.  hold on, candace, i'll save you.  i got you, candace.    oh, man, i love this umbrella.  hey, kids.  you know, candace, i was trying to say back there that...  well, the thing i like about you is...  wait. hold that thought.  i'll be right back.  mom. mom.  backyard. now.  biosphere.  doofenshmirtz: he's getting closer.  he's looking into her eyes.  he's opening his mouth.  he's forming his lips and tongue to articulate the syllables.  tell her, juan.  tell her why you love her.     what. no.  it's right here, mom.  come on. come on. come on.  kids: hi, candace.  mmm, i've really got to fix the latch on that gate.  um...  how is this possible.  i took every precaution.  i had the raininator, i had you trapped in the...  what the...   man, this is gonna cost me a fortune on my water bill.  so, did you ever find out why jeremy likes you.  jeremy.  now please continue your thought.  tell me why you like me.  you bet. the reason that i like you is...   candace: oh, stacy, isn't jeremy's hair the perfect shade of gold.  stacy: uhhuh.  isn't it cute when he gets that little wrinkle on the end of his nose.  uhhuh.  and you know when...  uhhuh.  stacy. did you make a digital sound file of yourself saying "uhhuh" to fool me into thinking you're listening to me again.  uhhuh.  stacy. pick up.  well, do you blame me.  "oh. jeremy and i went to the movies.  "jeremy's house smells like gingerbread.  "ever notice jeremy's mole is shaped like an adorable puppy." i'm starting to feel like the only reason you hang out with me is to talk about jeremy.  stacy, i...  i miss you, candace.  i miss when we would spend time together, just the two of us.  and i bet you didn't remember that today is the danville street fair.  stacy, i'm so sorry.  i'm going to cancel with jeremy today.  meet me at the cafe in a half an hour and we'll hit the street fair afterwards.  it'll be just the two of us.  i promise.  really. great.  but no jeremy anything. okay.  if i even hear his name...  i promise i won't break this promise.  see you in a bit.  now to call jeremy.  wait. why call him when i can tell him i can't see him today in person.  this is it, isabella.  the day you're going to insist on spending some time alone with phineas.  i can do this.  what you doing.  hey, isabella.  we're building a giant robot dog.  like when we made that title sequence.  mmm, i'd rather give a monkey a shower.  so... uh... phineas...  i was wondering if maybe after this, you'd like to go to the premiere of the new stumbleberry finkbat movie.  huh. oh, sure.  sounds cool.  i'd like to go to that.  uh, sorry.  i only have one extra ticket, and it's sold out.  so i thought maybe phineas and i would go...  not to necessarily exclude...  yeah, i can go after we finish up here.  done with the wiring, ferb.  lookin' good.  hey, where's perry.  comfortable, perry the platypus.  i made that platyrack so that every limb is accounted for.  so, what's it all about.  you see, there were only two things that made my miserable childhood bearable.  my giant pet cockroach, hoarfrost, and garlic ice cream.  i loved these two things so much, i wondered if combining them would exponentially increase my enjoyment of them.  so, introducing, my combineinator.  with my combineinator, i was finally able to make the triplescoopgarlicroach cone.  so cold.  yeah.  ow.  so, anyway, i remembered this little island timeshare that i bought on a free trip to vegas.  and i realized that if i were to combine my tiny island with the capitol of the tristate area, like so, tada.  then legally, under our local property laws, i will be sovereign ruler of the tristate area.  as long as i file the appropriate paper work and get it in by the end of business today so i can declare eminent domain before the timeshare reverts to the coowners, making them de facto rulers of the tristate area.  it's foolproof, really.  oh, hello, candace.  hey, mrs. johnson.  is jeremy in.  come on in.  he's right over there.  is he okay.  oh, sure, he was just up all night working the graveyard shift at slushy dawg after a full day shift.  then when he came home, he ate an entire turkey, drank a gallon of warm milk and just passed out on the sofa. bless him.  i'd be surprised if he woke up before next thursday.  good luck getting any conversation out of him, sweetie.  thanks.  aw, look how cute he is when he's sleeping.  psst. jeremy.   oof. all right, you asked for it.  i hereby dedicate this giant prism...  so, stacy and i just need a little girl time and that's...  okay, that was weird.  uh, so you'll have to take a rain check, okay.   we're attached.  stacy's gonna kill me.  phineas and ferb.  tail wag solenoids, check.  slipperchewing radiocontrolled bicuspids, check.   hey, phineas.  what you still doing.  just going through a last minute checklist now that the dog is done.  oh. does that mean we can, uh, go to the movies.  hey, ferb.  let's fire this puppy up.  i don't see why not.  great. we can still catch the matinee.  phineas.  what have you done.  well, we made this giant robotic...  just look at us.  we're all fused together.  see. i don't care what kind of freaky project you guys are doing.  just get us unstuck.  we could remove you to a sterile environment and get a boardcertified surgeon to cleanly and safely perform a jerebotomy.  we could tie each of you to a monster truck and drive in opposite directions.  worst case scenario.  someone loses a torso.  or we can use the molecular separator.  that thing you used to separate me from me.  yeah, it worked before.  you know, in a completely different set of circumstances.  great, you guys get on it.   hey, stacy.  hey, bff.  just checking on your eta.  about that...  oh, no.  you better not be ditching me to hang out with jeremy again.  what.  on street fair day.   no way, sister, i'll be there.  and i'll be there early.   yeah, alone. okay.  okay.  oh, crud. make that molecularwhatever and meet me at the coffee shop.  yeah, but the movie's going to start in...  and don't be late.  this is your fault.  i don't know what she's talking about, ferb.  but i do know the next thing we're gonna do today.  let's get started on that separator.  so, here we are, just the two of us.  at a stalemate.  each looking for something to turn the tide.  but what will it be.  cupcakes.  oop.   watch this.  prepare to face the wrath of norminshmirtz.   you can't get away from me now.  don't you mean, "us".  hey, don't step on my moment phineas and ferb better find a fix for this... oh.  hey, girlfriend.  oh, hey, stace.   two iced teas, please.  so, candace, sorry i was so hard on you before.  i know you and jeremy aren't together all the time.  oh. no, really, it's okay.  it's nice to have a little space from him.  oh, look, our drinks.  two iced teas.  both: thanks.     so. i hear there's a ton of vintage clothing stalls at the street fair this year.  yeah. i'm looking for some really cool...  wow. this table's really lumpy.  oh, yeah. lumpy tables.  it's the new hip thing.  it's so european.    . do the moan, moan yeah, do the moan come on, stace.  don't you love that song.  . do the moan .  hey. isn't that that guy from that movie.  what. where.  i don't see him.  what guy.   . lullaby and good night dadadada... .  i don't see anyone.  that's because he's gone.  candace, why are you acting so nervous.  i'm not mad anymore.  i'm going to pay for our drinks.  okay.  ready.  candace, why are you wearing that coat.  brr. that iced tea gave me a chill.  okay. let's go but you're walking behind me.  okiedoke.  phineas, will you hurry.  we're heading to the street fair already.   i think we're in trouble.  sure, now it's "we".  phineas: tada.  representing the molecular separator.  i can't believe how fast we rebuilt this, ferb.  of course, breaking the immutable laws of physics is always easier the second time around.  great. does that mean we can go to the movies now.  sure does.  the movie theater is right next to the street fair.  all we've gotta do is get this to candace and separate her from jeremy.  well, what are we waiting for.  i believe we're waiting for rover to put the molecular separator down.  isabella: hey.  drop it, boy.  this would've never have happened if we'd given a monkey a shower.  i'm just sayin'.   . i'm so happy whenever . you and i are together . when it's just the two of us hanging around . around, around . don't need a jazz trio or a string quartet . string quartet . 'cause you and i are the perfect duet . duet . when we get together we make such a beautiful sound . yeah.  . we don't need nobody else . 'cause we can have fun all by ourselves . it's just the two, it's just the two of us today . it's just the two, it's just the two of us today . it's just the two, it's just the two of us . and i always want it to stay . just the two of us .  no.  hey. that hurt.   he's armed.  with my arm.   balsa wood.  it was on sale.  it's locked into overload.   would you like a nice frosty beverage.  hey.  that's private.  split up, guys.  maybe we can corner him.  both: aha.  both: aha.  buford: he's coming your way.  i'm running out of hiding places.  hey. i found all kinds of cute things.  move over.  i'm gonna try them on.  no. uh... i can see they fit you perfectly.  candace, are you karate chopping me.  what's going on.  heel, boy.  go, ferb.   no.  no.  both: no.  how is everyone doing that.  hey. i can feel my knees again.  oh, i'm sorry.  doofenshmirtz: so cold.  okay, listen, stacy, there was this blast, and i was sitting next to jeremy, and somehow we got...  jeremy, jeremy, jeremy.  tell me later.  i want to try this on.   stacy, honest, i really wanted to spend the day with you, but...  but... but...  and we were...  uh, never mind.  candace.  jeremy.  i know this is a weird question, but do you have any idea how i got here.  jeremy, don't worry.  i promise i'll explain everything later.  but right now you gotta get out of here.  i'll call you later.  i mean... tomorrow.  phew.  by the way, the best part was when you used him as a table.  busted.  so, we, uh, got everything sorted out now.  yeah. wanna catch that movie.  oh, phineas.  okay, bro, i guess i'll see you back at the house.  oh, my gosh.  hey, does this mean we can all go now.  yes. yes, it does.  .  we don't need nobody else .
