of his personality.   you know, he has a reset buttonand they end up switching him.   amigos. we're all amigos.   so for a while he speaks perfect spanish.   it's pretty hysterical.   we got to switch him back.  to find out more we met with the film's director and producer.  so first questionhow did you come up withthe idea for spanish buzz.  one day we were in a meeting and we were thinking, what if he accidentally got switched into spanish mode.  come on, el buzzo.   it's full of possibilities because he can not only speak spanish, but he can start acting completely differently.   he's quite the dancer now isn't he.  yeah, totally.  does buzz have a favorite dance move.  they do this kind of likekind of a move.   but you know, i think anydance move where he gets to just  have his eyes locked on jessie's makes him happy.   did you fix buzz.  eh, sort of.  at first she'skind of weirded out.    she starts to kind of enjoy his macho bravado.  buzz.   and eventually ends in this really
