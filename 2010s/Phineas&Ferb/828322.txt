 . there's a hundred and four days of summer vacation . and school comes along just to end it . so the annual problem for our generation . is finding a good way to spend it . like maybe . building a rocket, or fighting a mummy . or climbing up the eiffel tower . discovering something that doesn't exist hey.  . or giving a monkey a shower . surfing tidal waves . creating nanobots or locating frankenstein's brain it's over here.  . finding a dodo bird painting a continent . or driving our sister insane phineas.  . as you can see, there's a whole lot of stuff to do . before school starts this fall come on, perry.  . so stick with us, 'cause phineas and ferb are gonna do it all.  . so stick with us, 'cause phineas and ferb are gonna do it all. .  mom, phineas and ferbare making a title sequence.  ood getting downaround town with my main men, phineas and ferb.  i think those translationworking for you, meap.  rock and roll.  meap. later, meap.  isabella: hi, phineas.  what you doing.  aw, you missed it. we were just talking to meap on the galactic web.  what is that, flashing on your screen.  hmm... i don't know.let's open it up, ferb.  hi, my name is morg.  have you ever wished that you could pop off to another planet on the other side of the galaxy for a quick visit.  well, now you can, with mind sharevacations. hmm...  you and your friends can trade places with me and my fr for the interplanetary vacation of a lifetime.  that sounds like fun.  imagine relaxing on a hot rock by the pools of nin surrounded by beautiful newps.  or splort through the tube worm forest of pstle foomp.  whoohoo. hmm...  here's how it works.  your mind comes to lodge in his head, and his mind goes to stay in yours.  only your mind makes the trip. hmm...  all you have to do is build this highly sophisticated device, and be on your way to pri... a mind share vacation of a lifetime.  ferb, i think i know what we're going to do today.  it sounded like he almost said we are on our way to perry.   hey, where is perry.   monogram: morning, agent p.  we have intelligence that doofenshmirtz may have taken up square dancing.  he cannot be allowed to use one of our beloved american traditions for his evil purposes.  so get out there and make sure he dosidoesn't do that, i guess.   there, finished.  well, that was easier than i thought.  let's fire this bad boy up.   brace yourselves for fun, because we're going on a mind share vacation.  baljeet: i think it did.  buford: hey, wait a second. where the heck are we.  oh, prison. we were on our way to prison.  isabella: that's what he almost said.  morg: hmm, our escape plan worked perfectly.  we are now free to ransack this planet.  everyone, celebration noises.    okay, that's enough.  ferb: it appears as though we've been transported into some sort of intergalactic hoosegow.  i was framed.  i'm afraid we've all been duped into aiding in the escape of some rather brilliant galactic prisoners.  and they did it with this little gadget.  phineas, that's you.  that's right, losers. hmm...  we pulled the old switcheroo.  in case you chumps have any ideas about coming back, we're setting the deviceon our end to selfdestruct in one hour.  alien 1:why are we waitingan hour to destroy it.  alien 2:have youno sense of drama.  sayonara, suckers. hmm...  ain't that the squirts.  well, look on the bright side...  i got nothing.  hey, guys, i just realized something.  i'm the only fly in a prison full of frogs and lizards.  luckily, i do not think, anyone else has noticed.  inmate 1: you're mine, flyboy.  inmate 2: we're gonna get you.  well, it was nice knowing you.  i think, i figured out how we can reverse this thing.  we'll be back in our own bodies in no time, barring any unforeseen...  what's that.  out of your cells, ladies. surprise inspection.  cell number 12, don't make me come down there.  morg. what are you and your misfits up to this time.  what's that. oh, uh...  contraband.  one more infraction out of you nerds and i will put you all in the hole for good, you got it.  the guard just took our only connection back to earth. now what are we gonna do.  i think we might be able to rebuild it, if we could just get the parts.  we need to find a guy who knows how to get things.  every prison has one.  how do you know what every prison has...  uhuh, don't go there.  whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. where on earth do you think you're going.  we're going to lotsmo to steal food.  what. are you pretending to be aliens or something.  hmm... yes. pretending.  hilarity noises.   i'm not gonna tell you again.   gotcha.  i know what you're thinking.  why the snazzy get up. why the boots.  well, you see, i met this girl, rosie, on a square dancing website and i may have led her to believe that i'm an expert square dancer.  hey. don't give me that selfrighteous look.  it's the web, man. everybody stretches the truth.  you don't think that cat really eats cheeseburgers, do you.  anyway, that's why i made these boots, to help me dance.  see, they have these little microphones that hear all the commands of a square dance caller, and they move exactly to those commands, making me the perfect square dancer.  so, i really want to make a good impression.  maybe you can come along and, you know, make me look good.  what do you say. will you be my wingman.  there's my guy.  oh, yeah, and by the way, she also thinks i'm a champion bull rider.  so if it comes up, you...  hey. don't look at me like that.  red: there must be a guy like me in every prison in the universe.  i'm the guy who knows how to get things.  dragonflies, a warm rock if that's your thing, or maybe a lily pad for your kid's graduation.  so when morg and his friends needed parts for a mind swap device, they came looking for me.  psst.  i understand you're a guy that knows how to get things.  stop it. stop it. what is wrong with you.  spit him out.  i am sorry. i skipped breakfast.  what is it you are looking for.  here, we made a list.  you can find everything you need in the dumpster out back of the lotsmo on flyway 61.  so, then, you can get us the stuff.  no, i'm not the guy who gets things.  i'm the guy who knows how to get things.  you would have to tunnel out of your cell and crawl 500 yards through the prison gunge pipe just to reach the outside.  that's the length of five football fields.  i know how long a football field is.  red: later that day, to make their escape, those boys crawled through 500 yards of foulsmelling nastiness i can't even imagine.  five hundred yards. that's the length of 11 baseball banners, one tennis court, a medium sized male elephant and a croquet wicket.  it wasn't long before they found everything that they needed.  great. let's hurry up and put this thing together.  the sooner, the better.  but if we do the mind swap here, those criminals will still be out of jail.  you're right. i haven't thought of that.  red: so even later that day, those boys crawled back through 500 yards of foulsmelling nastiness that i...  actually, it is not as bad as you would think.  yeah, gunge is actually quite refreshing.  red: oh, well, it was still 500 yards.  that's the length of two volleyball courts, a nimitzclass aircraft carrier a large three drawer filing cabinet, three friends... buford: we're not listening anymore.  red: oh. okay, then.  ooh. check it out, perry the platypus. there she is.  that's rosie.  she's from hazel park.   by the race track.  why don't you go over there and sit with the other wingmen.  and you can, you know, give me hand signals in case i get stuck.  right.  hi, there. i'm johnnyringoinshmirtz217.  oh, so nice to finally meet you face to face.  i must say, i like a man with a strong chin.  oh...
