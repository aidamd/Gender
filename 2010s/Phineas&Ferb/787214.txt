insult.  what is the rest of this.  candace has us build this to show us what motherhood is like.  okay...  candace, you made them build all this.  no, that's not fair.  you know, candace, you're gonna have to clean all this up.  mom suit, i swear.  i'm not even gonna ask.  how do you only manage to see this one.  why only mine.  wait, come back.  oh, this is so unfair.  wait.  hey, candace.  i was just stopping by to invite youhm.  well, nice mom suit.  see. he gets it.    heinz.  elizabeth.  best decision i ever made.   see, isn't this the coolest game ever.  it's called "jump and duck." hey, how'd you get your face in there.  easy.  i just used this camera.  see.  cool.  and then you do this.  and this.  and this, and this, and this, and this, and this.  and this, and this.  and

cotillion.  it's like a dance.  yes, it's a real word.  all i know is it's gonna be great.  wait a minute.  i just thought of something.  two somethings actually.  and one of them is pointy.  stacy, i'll call you back.  it's time for a little preemptive bust.  so beyond jumping and ducking, what's the actual objective of this game.  it's called "jump and duck," duh.  i can see no educational value in this game.  huh. hahaha.  consider yourself educated.  i stand corrected.  far be it for me to cast aspersions on jumping and/or ducking, but i think you can improve this. with a little effortwhat are you guys up to.  playing a video game.  that's it.  that's all you're doing today.  huh, how normal.  i guess my night's safe after all.  who would have guessed you two would get sucked into a video game.  i'm gonna go get ready.  sucked into a video game.  brilliant.  ferb, i know what we're gonna do today.  hey, where's perry.  good morning, agent p.  i've been monitoring doofenshmirtz's internet activity.  first, we know what you're getting for christmas.  don't ask, our lips are sealed.  it's a vase.  second, he's been doing a lot of research into the molecular structure of taffeta, satin, and most ominous of all: velour. ugh.  . perry .  introducing, the all new and improved "jump and duck," the world's first truly immersive video game experience.  hey, ferb, throw the switch.  he and once you're zapped into the game by the digitizerokay, what's going on.  i was drying my hair.  sorry about the power, candace.  ferb went to check the circuit breaker.  jeremy is gonna get here any minute.  hey, where'd you guys go.  we didn't go anywhere.  but you're inside the video game.  what do you mean i'm in the wow, cool.  how come she got to go first.  . doofenshmirtz evil incorporated .  ah, perry the platypus, you are too late.  wait, is it 11:00 yet.wait...  now.  now you are too late.  so, perry the platypus, tremble in fear, before the most twisted, nightmarish creation the world has ever known.  th  you see. it's hard to fight when you're in a ballgown.  it's portable too.  ooh, you look so elegant, like you're going to a cotillion.  it's a word.  it means "dance." so why would i create my mother spent months knitting pretty dresses.  unfortunately, the baby turned out to be a boy, and because we were out of material, i was forced to wear those same dresses for an entire year.  drawing mockery and scorn from all of my manly classmates.   now with my ballgowninator, i will be the manliest man in the tristate area.  you know, by comparison.  because everyone else would be wearing dresses.  after i shoot them with my ballgowniator.  am i overexplaining this.  because i had this whole musical number prepared and...  oh. oh, you're good.  okay.  take five, girls.  you guys better get me out of here.  i still have to get ready.  well, we designed a whole bunch of different worlds you have to go through to get to the boss.  but, you know, just continue screen right.  can't you just press a button and get me there now.  oh, you want cheat codes.  no, we don't roll like that.  just jump and duck.  okay, not necessarily in that order.  just choose the appropriate action that corresponds to the height of the fruit.  what does that even mean.  phineas: duck.  now run.  duck.  okay, you could try to jump here.  duck, duck, duck, duck.  duck, duck...  okay, stop falling.  stop falling.  yeesh. maybe we should go in and help her.  don't worry, candace, we're coming.  hm, maybe they should call it "jump, duck and blow." whoa.  what happened here.  oh, that's right.  candace has her hairdryer.  we'll just follow the carnage.   . analog is so five terabytes ago .  . come inside this digital domain .  . if you wanna be heroes .  . in a world of ones and zeroes .  . we'll leave behind the boring and mundane .  . don't be the bug in my system .  . or else we're gonna crash and fall .  . yeah, let's go digital .  . yeah, let's go digital .  . yeah, let's go digital .  . yeah, let's go digital .  . don't you worry so the only way to go .  . cyberspace is really quite a trip .  . when you switch your mode to raw binary code .  . we'll run amok inside a microchip .  . don't be the bug in my system .  . or else we're gonna crash and fall .  . yeah, let's go digital .  . yeah, let's go digital .  . yeah, let's go digital .  . yeah, let's go digital .  . yeah, let's go digital .  . yeah, yeah .  . let's go digital .  . yeah, let's go digital .   you know, perry the platypus, that dress sort of suits you.  if, you know, you just accentuate the positive, as they say.  um, i'm going to stop talking now.  i'm moving into a weirdhey, what the. aah.  what's going on here.  oh, it's on now.   oh, great.  w everyone's staring.  wow, the castle.  nice art direction, ferb.  i guess candace already made it to the boss level.   sweet. come on.  i forgot that we made buford the boss.  it's a little disturbing having him trying to obliterate us, but it made him so happy.   candace: hey, ugly.  drop the twerps, you freak.   nobody picks on my brothers butcandace, look out.  all right, candace.  way to phineas. ferb.  phineas. ferb.  no.   hey, candace.  what's the matter.  you guys are okay.  well, yeah.  we have, like, four lives left.  wait. you guys let me believe you were really dead.  if we ever get out of here, you're gonna be sohey, what's going on.  awesome. we're out.  so you must've beat the boss.  yeah.  it was a piece of cake.  cool. how'd you get him the second time.  what do you mean second time.  you know, after you defeat him the first time, how he comes back, and he's twice as strong.  what did you then.  um...   the last level's in the real world. run.  no, guys.  he looks like a nice guy.  ow.  okay, maybe not.  oh, now i see the educational value.  you know, eventually i'm getting out.     exactly as planned.    hey, you.  huh.  isabella, no.  leave my friends
