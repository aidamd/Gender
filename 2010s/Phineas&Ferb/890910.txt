louder.  aone, two. doofenshmirtz evil incorp.  oh, what now.   a banjoplaying platypus.  perry the banjoplaying platypus.  uh, take five, guys.  not you, perry the platypus.  iif i can just have a word with you.    it's a cute little trap, isn't it.  i got the idea at my cousin gertrude's baby shower.  well, don't judge me.  men go to baby showers these days.  it was fun.  presents, blindfolded diaperingi'm sorry, i'm off topic, aren't i.  it's this darn midsummer's festival, with the laughing and the music ging on my bell to use my bathroom.   well, i'm going to put an end to it once and for all.  you see, i have created a device that will cover the entire midsummer's festival with the worst smell in the history of mankind.  dirty diapers.  and, yeah, i got all that from a baby shower.  how do you like me now, perry the judgeapus.  can't you just make up some kind of reducing cream, or an amazing shrink ray device.  well, we'll see what we can do, but we're not magicians.   i'm a freak.   i'll never be a flawless girl.  there's only one place where a girl like me w.  the oddball show.  it was nice knowing you boys.  tell mom and dad i love them.  from now on, i'll be living amongst the carnies.    excellent. now, all we need is a big promotional stunt.  here's what i got in mind.  in a reversal of a familiar theme, you can climb a skyscraper, carrying me dressed in this gorilla suit.  um, okay.  how long have you been wearing that.  all day.  so, perry the platypus, i found a way to distill the smell of dirty diapers into a concentrated liquid form, which i will spread throughout the festival using my smellinator.    and the next flawless girl is oh, that is the most flawless girl i've ever seen.  is all this really necessary.  come on, kid.  you can't back out now.  blanca: candace.  i've got some great news.  i can't hear you.  ah, hold on.  blanca: i said i've got some great news.  you are the next flawless girl.  with your height, girls will never be able to live up to thexpectations you'll set.  they'll be forced to buy my product forever.  scram.  she's my oddball.  no, my flawless girl.  she's a freak.  she's freakishly beautiful.  wait a second.  i just realized something.  you both make money off of people's natural insecurities.  you show people oddballs so that they'll feel better about themselves, and you make beauty totally unattainable so they'll feel worse about themselves.  look at me.  i'm 50 feet tall now and it's still out of reach.  well, i've had it.  making beauty the focus of my life has distracted me from the real focus of my life.  busting my brothers.  giant candace is out.  peace.   growth elixir.  so this is what she used.  let me see that.  it's my growth elixir.  no, it's mine.  mine.  mine.  now, watch as the smell of dirty diapers permeates the very molecules that surround this building.  i just snap it into place and set the range for, say, 200 yards around the building.   hear that perry the platypus.  that is the sound of smell.  nothing can stop me now.   doofenshmirtz: uh, oh, the whole universe.  not good.  mom. mom.  look what phineas and ferb did to me.  i am 50 feet tall.  i don't even fit in the...  house.  i'm back to normal.  normal, being a relative term.  well, it doesn't smell any different.  i wonder what went wrong.  oh, here's my stinkypoopoo stuff.  i thought i put this in my smellinator.  no.  oh, god, what was i thinking.  so did you win the giant watermelon contest.  i was about to when this happened.  so the watermelon shrank.  well, either that or everything else in the universe just got bigger.  c'est la vie.  shame curtains are not gonna hang themselves.   ooooceew. orrr there's our new pet goldie.  i wonder if we're as cute to her as she is to us.  yeah.  yeah, we are.  what can we do for goldie since she's already done so much for us.  a marine life aquarium.  great idea, ferb.  let's build the best ever of one of these and give goldie that special home she deserves.  does that sound good to you, perry.   so it's unanimous.  hey, where's candace.  candace, where are you.  what are you doing.   waiting for jeremy to call.  last night at the movies he said he was gonna call "soon." i calculate that "soon" must mean first thing in the morning, since "soon" can't refer to a period in excess of or equal to 24 hours give or take a 59 minute cushion of time on either side of the event in question.  see, i he it all figured out right here on this notepad.  i even showed my math.  uhwait, maybe i should have carried the one instead of dividing by jeremy's face.  well, i'm off to my favorite author's book signing.  try not to freak out on your brothers while i'm gone.  mom, i don't freakoh, my gosh.  the square root of soon is never.  i got the filter done.  how's the water coming.  herman, are you taking a shower.  herman: no.  well, you need one.  phineas: there you go, goldie.  ome.  it's huge, it's amazing, it'sit's lonely.  we need to get her some friends.  aren't you boys a little young to man a fishing vessel.  why yes, yes we are.  well, all right then.  hey, where's perry.    major : aw, agent p, pardon the newspapers, but, uh, we have a lot of new, young recruits coming through here today, and, well, they're not, uh, trained yet.  anyway, doofenshmirtz has recently purchased the tristate ar entire supply of bratwurst.  get to the bottom of it.  oh, and, uh, watch your step on the way out.   goldie, how do you like your new friends.   no.  phineas: that was cool enough to be in one of those trained marine animal shows.  hm.  ferb, i know what else we're gonna do today.  . doofenshmirtz evil incorporated .     doofenshmirtz: yoohoo.  perry the platypus.   say hello to the to the platypussecretagentarrival inordertofoilmyevilplot captureinator.  or as i like to call it: my p.s.a.a.i.o.t.f.m.e.p.cinator.  i made it up myself.  enough chitchat, let me tell you my latest evil scheme.  you see, back before i was evil, i was something a little less than evil.  i was a bratwurst street vendor.  . doofenshmirtz quality bratwurst .  what. they had those.  see nobody remembers them.  you know why.  because of the hot dog vendors.  oh, how i hated them.  they had it all.  they had chromeplated carts and endorsement deals, fancy blimps.  and what did we have.  only superior workmanship, finer meats and exotic spices.  i was sure that it was just a matter of time before the public would recognize our superior quality.  how do you know when you're really lame.  when you sell bratwursts.   the hotdogvendor revenginator.  or my h.d.v.ri admit, ii have to work on my acronyms.  here's how it works.   and once i've taken the hot out of the dog, they'll be forced to sell my bratwursts instead.  don't roll your eyes at me.  it's a good plan.  sorry to go off on you like that, perry the platypus, but sometimes you just, ugh, really push my buttons.  ooh, i can't take anymore.  i'm just gonna call him.    . when will you call me. .  . when will it ring. .  . sometimes i think my sanity .  . is hanging by a shoestring .  . when will he call me. .  . how long is soon. .  . should i check my watch my calendar .  . or phases of the moon. .  . he doesn't have to call me .  . he can email me or text me .  . but all this hanging by the phone .  . has really vexed
