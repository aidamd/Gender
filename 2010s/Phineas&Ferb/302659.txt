 okay, let's do this thing for real.  . doofenshmirtz holding a bucket .   ah, perry the platypus.  you're just in time for my backstory.  you see, it all started a lifetime ago.  i was young and in love with a beautiful girl.  she taught me how to see the beauty of life.  and i taught her how to hold a petty grudge.  she was very interested in whales for some reason.  in retrospect, it was probably more of an unhealthy obsession.  but to win her heart i created the whale translatorinator.  i rented the best oceanographic vessel that i could afford, and we headed out.  but when i turned the translatorinator on...   whale 1: what a loser that guy up there is.  whale 2: she should dump that pink chimp and go out with a real mammal like me.  doofenshmirtz: she left me for that trashtalking, 35ton pile of blubber, and broke my fragile, 10 ounce, utterly toohuman heart.  unfortunately, my translatorinator only worked in one direction, so i was not able to tell the whales what i thought of them.  until today. watch this.   see.  i taught myself whale song.  i just told him he's fat and he has barnacle breath.   come on, come on, who's diabolical.  okay, first thing's first.  dismantle that thingamajig ofof weirdness.  sometimes i swear i'm the only normal one in this family.   like i said: weirdness.  now let's get serious.  see what i'm wearing here.  serious. this egg's not gonna hatch itself.  we need to build a nursery.  we have this cool blueprint for an incubator.  too antiseptic.  think warm and loving, not cold and clinical.  hugs and kisses, not hard and mechanical.   . motherhood's for life .  . it's not something in which you dabble .  . machines not built to last .  . i love you is only technobabble .  . a mother knows what's necessary .  . 'cause she always pays attention .  . that's why they say necessity .  . is the mother of invention .  . now i got you on the run .  . technology: 0 mother nature: 1 .   . a child cries out in the night .  . it's rarely for the washing machine .  . science can't improve upon a mother's heart .  . but given time it can trick out her spleen .  . so if you think you can build a better mother, let it go .  . 'cause nature already nailed it 16 million years ago .  . before we'd even begun .  . game over technology lost .  . mother nature won .  . game over technology lost .  . mother nature won .  so how does it feel to have your platyposterior handed to you on a plate, son.    i just told him his macaroni and cheese recipe is too cheesy and not macaroniy enough.    wait, wait, perry the platypus, what are you.  where are you going.  wait, wait.  my evil plan isn't evil enough for you to foil, is that it.  really.  i've just insulted the macaroni and cheese recipe of a whale.  what part of that is not evil.  perry the platypus, you get back here and thwart me this instant.  there, that just about does it.  candace.  i'll say when it just about does it.  mmhm.  hm. hm.  and how's my wuggawuggums.  so cute.  hm. not bad for a couple of boys.  you're pretty good at this.  you bet i am.  this is what real mothering looks like.   stymie me. foil me.  hey, what about the fact that i held a petty grudge against an inferior mammal all these years, huh.  thwart me, perry the platypus.  aw, come on.  i hope it's a girl.  come to mommy, snookawookums.   huh. it was just a bird.  that's not just any bird.  that's a rare whalesongsinging doublebreasted angle hooper.  the natural enemy of the platypus in the wild.  okay, okay, i have something really evil.  really, reallyit'sit's actually evil.  just kidding. haha.    ow, ow.   candace, i have your batteries.  candace.  what are you wearing.  it's my...mom suit.  all right.  i'll try not to take that as an insult.  what is the rest of this.  candace has us build this to show us what motherhood is like.  okay...  candace, you made them build all this.  no, that's not fair.  you know, candace, you're gonna have to clean all this up.  mom suit, i swear.  i'm not even gonna ask.  how do you only manage to see this one.  why only mine.  wait, come back.  oh, this is so unfair.  wait.  hey, candace.  i was just stopping by to invite youhm.  well, nice mom suit.  see. he gets it.    heinz.  elizabeth.  best decision i ever made.   see, isn't this the coolest game ever.  it's called "jump and duck." hey, how'd you get your face in there.  easy.  i just used this camera.  see.  cool.  and then you do this.  and this.  and this, and this, and this, and this, and this.  and this, and this.  and this, and this, and this.  and then this and this.  and then that. look.   this is awesome.  stacy, you are talking to the luckiest girl in this house.  jeremy is taking me to the summer cotillion.  cotillion.  it's like a dance.  yes, it's a real word.  all i know is it's gonna be great.  wait a minute.  i just thought of something.  two somethings actually.  and one of them is pointy.  stacy, i'll call you back.  it's time for a little preemptive bust.  so beyond jumping and ducking, what's the actual objective of this game.  it's called "jump and duck," duh.  i can see no educational value in this game.  huh. hahaha.  consider yourself educated.  i stand corrected.  far be it for me to cast aspersions on jumping and/or ducking, but i think you can improve this. with a little effortwhat are you guys up to.  playing a video game.  that's it.  that's all you're doing today.  huh, how normal.  i guess my night's safe after all.  who would have guessed you two would get sucked into a video game.  i'm gonna go get ready.  sucked into a video game.  brilliant.  ferb, i know what we're gonna do today.  hey, where's perry.  good morning, agent p.  i've been monitoring doofenshmirtz's internet activity.  first, we know what you're getting for christmas.  don't ask, our lips are sealed.  it's a vase.  second, he's been doing a lot of research into the molecular structure of taffeta, satin, and most ominous of all: velour. ugh.  . perry .  introducing, the all new and improved "jump and duck," the world's first truly immersive video game experience.  hey, ferb, throw the switch.  hey.  and once you're zapped into the game by the digitizerokay, what's going on.  i was drying my hair.  sorry about the power, candace.  ferb went to check the circuit breaker.  jeremy is gonna get here any minute.  hey, where'd you guys go.  we didn't go anywhere.  but you're inside the video game.  what do you mean i'm in the wow, cool.  how come she got to go first.  . doofenshmirtz evil incorporated .  ah, perry the platypus, you are too late.  wait, is it 11:00 yet.  wait...  now.  now you are too late.  so, perry the platypus, tremble in fear, before the most twisted, nightmarish creation the world has ever known.  the ballgowninator.   you see. it's hard to fight when you're in a ballgown.  it's portable too.  ooh, you look so elegant, like you're going to a cotillion.  it's a word.  it means "dance." so why would i create such a device as this. hm.  you see, back in gimmelshtoomp, in the depths of my childhood, my parents were expecting a brandnew baby girl.  my mother spent months knitting pretty dresses.  unfortunately, the baby turned out to be a boy, and because we were out of material, i was forced to wear those same dresses for an entire year.  drawing mockery and scorn from all of my manly classmates.   now with my ballgowninator, i will be the manliest man in the tristate area.  you know, by comparison.  because everyone else would be wearing dresses.  after i shoot them with my ballgowniator.  am i overexplaining this.  because i had this whole musical number prepared and...  oh. oh, you're good.  okay.  take five, girls.  you guys better get me out of here.  i still have to get ready.  well, we designed a whole bunch of different worlds you have to go through to get to the boss.  but, you know, just continue screen right.  can't you just press a button and get me there now.  oh, you want cheat codes.  no, we don't roll like that.  just jump and duck.  okay, not necessarily in that order.  just choose the appropriate action that corresponds to the height of the fruit.  what does that even mean.  phineas: duck.  now run.  duck.  okay, you could try to jump here.  duck, duck, duck, duck.  duck, duck...  okay, stop falling.  stop falling.  yeesh. maybe we should go in and help her.  don't worry, candace, we're coming.  hm, maybe they should call it "jump, duck and blow." whoa.  what happened here.  oh, that's right.  candace has her hairdryer.  we'll just follow the carnage.   . analog is so five terabytes ago .  . come inside this digital domain .  . if you wanna be heroes .  . in a world of ones and zeroes .  . we'll leave behind the boring and mundane .  . don't be the bug in my system .  . or else we're gonna crash and fall .  . yeah, let's go digital .  . yeah, let's go digital .  . yeah, let's go digital .  . yeah, let's go digital .  . don't you worry so the only way to go .  . cyberspace is really quite a trip .  . when you switch your mode to raw binary code .  . we'll run amok inside a microchip .  . don't be the bug in my system .  . or else we're gonna crash and fall .  . yeah, let's go digital .  . yeah, let's go digital .  . yeah, let's go digital .  . yeah, let's go digital .  . yeah, let's go digital .  . yeah, yeah .  . let's go digital .  . yeah, let's go digital .   you know, perry the platypus, that dress sort of suits you.  if, you know, you just accentuate the positive, as they say.  um, i'm going to stop talking now.  i'm moving into a weirdhey, what the. aah.  what's going on here.  oh, it's on now.   oh, great.  now everyone's staring.  wow, the castle.  nice art direction, ferb.  i guess candace already made it to the boss level.   sweet. come on.  i forgot that we made buford the boss.  it's a little disturbing having him trying to obliterate us, but it made him so happy.   candace: hey, ugly.  drop the twerps, you freak.   nobody picks on my brothers butcandace, look out.  all right, candace.  way to phineas. ferb.  phineas. ferb.  no.   hey, candace.  what's the matter.  you guys are okay.  well, yeah.  we have, like, four lives left.  wait. you guys let me believe you were really dead.  if we ever get out of here, you're gonna be sohey, what's going on.  awesome. we're out.  so you must've beat the boss.  yeah.  it was a piece of cake.  cool. how'd you get him the second time.  what do you mean second time.  you know, after you defeat him the first time, how he comes back, and he's twice as strong.  what did you then.  um...   the last level's in the real world. run.  no, guys.  he looks like a nice guy.  ow.  okay, maybe not.  oh, now i see the educational value.  you know, eventually i'm getting out.     exactly as planned.    hey, you.  huh.  isabella, no.  leave my friends alone.   no.  smile.  wow, isabella, that was great.  you know what they say.  the bigger they are, the harder they depixelate.  aargh. give it.  seafoam green.  i'm actually more of an autumn.  jeremy: candace.  oh, no, jeremy's here.  how am i going to get ready in three seconds.  apparently, do what we did.   oh, no.   i don't remember changing.  is this part of the game.  oh, there you are, perry.  but what am i gonna do.  huh.  wow, you look beautiful.  i guess you...  ...all look beautiful.  heh.  thanks. we think it's part of the game.  okay...  shall we go, candace.  uh, yes.  why do they call it a cotillion, anyway.  oh, don't get me started.   . i want someone to love me .  . for who i am .  . i want someone to need me .  . is that so bad. .  . i want someone to love me .  . for who i am .  . nothing makes sense, nothing makes sense anymore . nothing is right, nothing is right when you're gone .  . i want someone to love me .  . for who i am .  . i want someone to need me .  . is that so bad. .  . i want to break all the madness .  . but it's all i have .  . i want someone to love me .  . for who i am .  . yeah, for who i am. .   captioned by media access group at wgbh access.wgbh.org and the queen of the summer cotillion is...    oh, i am honored.  and at the same time, humiliated.  so thank you and curse you.    there's 104 days of summer vacation    then school comes along just to end it    so the annual problem for our generation    is finding a good way to spend it    like, maybe    building a rocket or fighting a mummy    or climbing up the eiffel tower    discovering something that doesn't exist   hey.   or giving a monkey a shower    surfing tidal waves, creating nanobots    or locating frankenstein's brain   it's over here.   finding a dodo bird, painting a continent    or driving our sister insane   phineas.   as you can see    there's a whole lot of stuff to do    before school starts this fall   come on, perry.   so stick with us 'cause phineas and ferb    are gonna do it all    so stick with us 'cause phineas and ferb    are gonna do it all   mom.  phineas and ferb aremaking a title sequence.  captioning made possible bydisneyabc cable
