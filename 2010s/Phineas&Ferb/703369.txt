"when life's never dull, wear a hull for your skull." how dare you do all this without permission.  but all our building permits are in order.  i meanmypermission.  this morning i asked you if we could modify our car to make it fly.  i was talking about your toy car.  how could you possibly think i meant my station wagon.  you are in so much trouble, young man.  but... we do this sort of thing every day.  what..  see, mom.  i told you...  but you never listened.  but i...  mom, phineas and ferb built a rollercoaster.  phineas and ferb are onehit wonders.  phineas and ferb carved my face into mount rushmore.  phineas and ferb are driving cattle.  phineas and ferb built a giant tree house robot...  ...are promoting a boxing match...  ...built a beach in the backyard...  ...built a time machine...  ...built a ski resort.  ...are directing a movie...  ...built a haunted house...  ...built a giant sundae maker...  ...are getting the band back together...  phineas and ferb are in my large intestine.  oh, candace. all the times i called you delusional you to my friends behind your back, all those journals i've filled with an eye towards standup comedy...  but you were telling the truth.  i'm so sorry.  you're the best daughter any mother could dream of having.  finally, you realize that.  well, what's all this yelling about.  oh, my word.  that is impressive.  did you know about this.  well, ii... ii, uh...  no.  what are you gonna do to them.  no tv for a month.  or they have to serve me for a year.  how about confiscating their toolbox.  i know.  take away their seats on the city council.  you have seats on the city council.  we rotate out with the board of selectmen.  well, some punishment may be in order, but, look, there's no harm done really.  hey, look, ferb, here's bolt number 473.  i hope that wasn't important.  well, at least the selfparking works.  heeheeheeheehee.  i'm sorry, but this is really for your own good.  we need you both to understand that what you've been doing is way too dangerous.  i'd never be able to live with myself if you got hurt.  we were wearing helmets.  don't worry. your boys will be in good hands.  as you can see from our realistically illustrated brochure, the smile away reformatory offers a serene, peaceful environment in which safety, discipline and responsibility are encouraged.  your boys will be whipped into shape in no time.  well, i'll be honest, ferb.  i didn't see this coming.  baljeet.  what are you doing here.  well, i got kicked out of summer school because my grades were too high.  but then i heard about this place.  sure, they break you down and strip you of your identity, but school is school.  bye, boys. see you at the end of summer.  yes. i actually busted phineas and ferb.  this is the happiest moment of my life.  whoohoo.  i'm finally free.   . the sun is up, the sky is blue . i can do whatever i want to .
