  good one, sir.  a big pink bunny.  . perry .  wait till jeremy sees how hot i am in my smokin' cave girl outfit.   psst.   oogabooga.  hi, it's stace.  do you think you could bring a sandwich platter to the party.  sure.  ooh, i'll bring roast beef.  jeremy eats roast beef on phinedays and satuferbs.  phineas and ferb, you're lustin' for a bustin'.  candace.  forget your brothers.  remember. jeremy.  right. jeremy.  sandwiches. true love.  your house. bye.  well, ferb, let's scout around and see what's what.  all right, let's see.  jurassic, cretaceous, plasticine...  oh, here's paleolithic, down here on the end.  perry the platypus.  oh, your persistence is insufferable.  and by that, i mean completely sufferable.  you are just in time, though, to watch me rid the tristate area of one of my biggest pet peeves: people who dress as sandwiches to promote restaurants.  you see. you see what i mean.  what is this. are you a person or are you a food.  for some reason, i don't mind the taco guy so much.  look at his cute little hat.  anyway, the whole thing sickens me to no end, which is why i created the sandwich suit removinator.  it sucks all sandwich suits up into the air and then shreds them to teensy, weensy pieces.  today i will fly all over the city and strip anyone dressed as a sandwich right down to their skivvies.  ah ha ha ha ha ha.  ooh hoo hoo.  hee hee hee hee ha ha.  woo hoo hoo hoo.  heh heh. uhh...  i've become my mother.  . ooh, oh, yeah after jeremy sees me lookin' so fly . he's gonna wanna be my guy uhhuh, uhhuh .   oh, hi, stacy.  yes, sandwiches. i'm on it.  this'll be fantastic.  think of all the practical applications a cave man can have in the modern world.  actually, you know, besides politics, i can't think of anything.  but

sandwich.  well, i'm sure i can spare one.  i know how men are about their meat.  argh. me manly man.  me like meat.  gee, uh, thanks, sis.  cool outfit, by the way.  you should meet our new friend.  he's a real neanderthal.  i don't care how buff he is.  me, hang out with one of your friends. please.  now run along before i take my sandwich back.  and if you even think about trying something funny today, you're gonna get it.  get what.  it.  well, if "it" is another sandwich, i'll take it now, please.  at last my efforts have come to fruition.  and nothing can stop me.   hmm.  i told vanessa if she takes out the big head, she has to fill it up.   ah, yes.  all zeroes make it so much easier to balance my check perry the platypus, are you asleep.  sometimes i wonder why i even

it's a cave man.  yeah. especially if it's a cave man.  how's the view up there, ferb.  this is the life.  the sand, the sea, the sun.   the crying.  hey, what's wrong, buford.  why are you crying.  first, let's get one thing straight.  i'm not cryin'.  i'm just sweatin' through my eyes.  and second...  i lost biff.   you mean your goldfish.  yes. he changed my life, you know.  i used to be a wimp, like you.  but then one day at the carnival, i was somehow drawn to this game.   and that's how i won my goldfish.  i named it biff, after my mother.  it was the happiest day of my life.  i finally had a friend.  but then i met the local bully.  hello, nerd. well, well, what have we here.  looks like you brought me lunch.  ha ha ha ha ha ha.  i knew i had to defend my friend, so i did what i had to do.   after that, i became the bully, and i wasn't afraid of anything or anybody, except, you know, maybe a giant squid, 'cause, come on, those are freaky, right.  all suction cuppy and beaky.  but then, today...  biff and i decided to go for a swim.  after a while, i couldn't hear him anymore.  i got worried.  no. no.   wow, this is more annoying than when he was bullying us.  we gotta do something to get the old buford back.  maybe we should help him find his fish.  really.  you guys would do that.  how about a hug.  maybe later.  let buford hug you.  hey, where's perry.  come here.  morning, agent p.  we've intercepted some very surprising footage from a local tv station.  breaking news.  a kitten in peril...  up a tree.  oh, no.   wow, a good samaritan saved her.  you see that.  dr. doofenshmirtz saving a kitten.  looks like he's defecting to the good side.  make contact and present him with our standard welcome package.  monogram out.  how about these.  do you think jeremy would like them.  ooh, these are even better.  hey, candace, look.  is that a submarine.  and aren't those your brothers.  i can't believe how fast we put this together.  yes. usually takes us at least a montage.  they're not getting away with this.  i know what i'm getting.  i'm gonna get this disposable camera, and then i'll finally have proof, and i can bust them.  hey, you gotta pay for that.  right after i pay for this.  . doofenshmirtz evil incorporated .   hello.  oh, perry the platypus.  what do you want.  oh, a gift for me.  oh, how sweet of you.  what's this note attached.  "congratulations, dr. heinz doofenshmirtz, on defecting to the good side".  oh, no, not you, too.  the tv's been repeating that news footage all day.  first of all, i'm not going to the good side.  second, i'm going to keep this basket.  there's a lot of goodies here.  third, let me tell you what really happened.  i was out picking up a few things, and as i was walking out of the store, i tripped on something.  as i fell, out of nowhere this kitten landed in my bag.  oh. after all my evil attempts to dominate the tristate area, this one little accident has ruined my reputation.  worst of all, it happened on the eve of the evil scientists' fraternity reunion.  if they see that broadcast, i'll be a laughingstock.  they might even take away my membership, and then i'll lose all my benefits.  hello.   i wasn't done talking yet.  that was sort of rude.  all right, isabella.  now it's your turn, baljeet.  why is buford crying.  i'm not cryin'.  i'm sweatin' through my eyes.   all right, buford, you're next.  that doesn't look very safe.  you're doing fine.  hey. i'm stuck.  i'm stuck. hey, buford, are you really sweating out of your eyes.  no. i'm just cryin'.   thanks. i needed that.  ready when you are, captain.  we're ready to go.  how's buford.  buford is doin' great.  i just hope we'll be able to find my friend biff.   don't worry. ferb can communicate with dolphins.   they'll help us find your goldfish.  biff.  he looks so sweet.   how about a hug.  come on.  all right, everyone, the dolphins are leading the way.   let's follow those aquatic mammals.  aye, aye, captain.   uh, buford, you just stay put.   . when i'm soaking in my bath . i dump you in the tub . there's no need to say another word . you had me at "glub" . your bowl became my world . so my world is empty now . all my love's caught in your filter )
