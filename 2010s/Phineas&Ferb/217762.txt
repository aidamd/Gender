kermillian.   what's going on.  phineas.  and now, behold kermillian's comet.  commence laserengraving sequence.  phineas, you guys put your face on a comet.  ooh, i'm telling mom.  good idea, candace.  she's gonna love it.  you're not trying to hack into the raygun system, are you.  what am i worried about.  you'll never guess my supersecret password.   doofalicious.  access granted.  ok, that's enough.  overload.  uhhhuh. this should be fun.  ooow.  ferb, take it easy with the lasers.  remember, we still got an 8:30 show.  can i have everyone's attention.  please don't panic.  we're experiencing technical difficulties.  calmly head towards the exits in a calm, orderly ok, now you can panic.   ferb, what's happening.  that was so cool.   stop this, sca.  now that i'm looking at the sign, i think it really does look more like scu.  stop this, scu.  come back here.  perry the platypus, come back.  ooh, something smells delicious.  curse you, perry the platypus.  i can't believe we drove around the whole city and couldn't find one steak.  mom, they used a laser to carve their faces in the comet.  candace, i don't see anything.  no, no, no.  you could only see it from their observatory.  come on, come on. see.  well, i don't see an observatory.  sorry, everyone.  we looked all over town, and we couldn't find any steaks.   and i even brought my own plate.  at least we can all enjoy kermillian's comet together.  yeah, before it disappears for another 73 1/2 years.  just wait. when i'm 88, you will be so busted.  actually, you'd be 88 1/2.  whatever.  so, honey, make a wish.  i wish we had steaks.  yeah, me too.  i'll be honest. i didn't think that would work.  i did not bring a plate.  i thought they would be provided.  dude, we keep getting served.  yeah, i'm gettin' used to it.  candace, are you ok.  you mean you came over to check on me.  of course.  oh, there you are, perry.  so, that's kermillian's comet.  did you make a wish.  yes.  and did it come true. )
