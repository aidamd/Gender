age was once the future, as was the middle ages.  creativity and invention never end.  there's a whole bunch of stuff you can do this summer.  . like maybe .  . crossing the tundra .  . building a roller coaster .  . skiing down a mountain of beans .  . devising a system .  . for remembering everything .  . or synchronizing submarines .  . racing chariots training tiger sharks .  . constructing a portal to mars .  . building a time machine stretching a rubber tree .  . wailing away on guitar .  . this could possibly be .  . the best day ever .  . and the forecast says .  . that tomorrow wi likely be .  . a million and six times better .  . so make every minute count .  . jump up, jump in .  . and seize the day .  . and let's make sure that .  . in every single possible way .  . today is going to be a great day .  thanks a lot, guys.  no, problem.  we appreciate the gig.  bowling for soup.  eh. before their time.  so, what are you guys going to make this summer.  how abouhbumper cars

vaccine.  cool. let's make like a banana and invert our molecules through the spacetime continuum.  they weren't at my house so they must be here.  honey, i can't move as fast as i used to.  there. no.  we're too late.  mom.  i've always loved this old bone.  mom, you never saw them.  and you still never see them.  it's not fair. it's not fair.  it's not fair.  candace, you're a grown woman.  i really thought you had finally moved past all this nonsense.   candace: come on, mom, hurry.  this is great, candace, really.  but i have lots to do today.  in here, see.  the time machine is gone.  mom.  oh, hi, candace.  mom.  mom.  look, candace.  they're putting a new bone on display.  oh, you missed it again.  hi, mom.  oh, hi, boys.  wow, imagine the size of the creature that bone came from.  i know, huh.    no. can't you see.  they were time travelling.  this obsession with the boys has gone on too long.  you need to stop.  i won't stop.  never, never, never.   and i was so close to busting them.  great bertha's bloomers.  i've done it.  i, professor onasis, have invented a time machine.  excuse me, future female of thepecies, have corndogs been invented yet.  yes.  hot dog. i'm staying.  sharon's internet tooth pops out right in the middle of math class wait. my mom's calling.  hi, mom, what the fizz.  amanda, i'm taking a short trip today.  while i'm away, you're in charge.  i'm in charge.  wait. what are you doing.  nothing.  i knew it.  you never do anything.  now, where do i go.  more importantly, when.  i know. i'll set it for a date i know i can bust the boys.  back to the first day of that summer.  the day they built the roller coaster.  sometimes it's here, sometimes it's not.  what do i care.   phenias and ferb got a roller coaster.  you think we get a discount if we bring the flyer.  maybe we had better take it.  here. look, look, look. see.  i told you i'm not crazy.  i told you.  and you're not crazy because....   the poster's missing right.  follow me.   oh, my stars.  phenias and ferb made that.  it's horribly unsafe and dangerous.  hello. police, fire department, army, air force, marines, anyone save my sons.   it's no use. it's no use.  we are doomed.  man : base to chopper one. kids built a roller coaster downtown.  man:it's beroger that.   i'm alive.  fireman: roger. got the kids.  bringing them down now.  phineas, ferb, you two are in so much trouble.  yes. yes.  my work here is down.  back to the future.  first day on the job and i'm already seeing thing.   oh, thank goodness.  it's great to be back...home.  "welcome to danville."  uhoh.  @@@@$$$ i can't believe this is danville.  hello. what happened to the museum.  didn't you get the new shmirtz mail.  it's the new doofen law.  law number 6 million and seven: all museums that aren't about doofenshmirtz are to be dismantled.  hey, why aren't you wearing your lab coat.  uh, i've got to go see my children.  children.  there are no children aloud anymore.  how long have i been away.  that's strange.  joe's, joe's, joe's.  hi, joe.  hello, joe.  pardon me, joe.  you haven't seen my wife, joe or my friends joe and joe.  uh, no.  thanks anyway, joe.  why is everyone named joe.  ha. why else.  so emperor doofenshmirtz need not bother remembering names.  and who is.   i've said too much.  i've said too much.   who the heck is doofenshmirtz.  candace: that's odd. i've got to find out what happened in the last 20 years.  announcer: our glorious dystopia began one summer afternoon when two local boys were caught building and riding a dangerous roller coaster.  the rightful reaction by concerned parents groups was to stop all creativity in young people before someone got hurt.  everything fun and unique was gleefully banned.  dangerous swing sets were remade into dismal hospital beds.  coloring books were colored in ahead of time and inside the lines.  eventually children themselves were child proofed and stored away until adulthood.  yes, oppressive beauty and happiness were gratefully replaced by the glimmering cesspool we wallow in today.  a demoralized tristate area cried out to be oppressed.  and that cry was answered by one hero:  emperor doofenshmirtz.  oh, get back to work.  so this is all my fault.  i've got to stop this.  excuse me, joe.  lab coats must be worn at all times.   sir, a woman just ran past your statue there without basking in your awful glory.  oh, joe, you're such a tattle tale.  well, yeah. that's my job description: tattle tale.  quiet. i need to address the populous.  attention underlings.  people often ask me, "doof, how does it feel to wield such absolute power." well i'll tell you..  . it's been a charmed life .  . got all i ever wanted .  . and i'm not too shy to flaunt it .  . you see it's been a sweet ride .  . everyone is genuflecting .  . and erecting giant statues of me .  . it's like a great lunch .  . with all you can eat .  . and i can leave my wallet at home .  . and everyone pays for me because it's compulsory .  . or into the stockade their thrown .  . still, i'm a nice guy .  . how many emperors would always remember you name. .  how you doing, joe.  . i must admit .  . i may take quite a lot .  . but i'll always give you plenty of blame .  . it's been a sweet ride .  . life's a bowl of cherries .  . and nobody's merrier than me .  . because everyone else .  . is the proletariat .  . and, baby i'm the bourgeoisie .  look it up, joe.  . baby .  . i'm the bourgeoisie .  . oh, yeah .  agent p, another failed mission.  it's gotten really hard to defeat doofenshmirtz ever since we swore that oath to obey him.  major monogram, i've detected a temporal anomaly in quadrant four which means a time machine was recently used there.  that's it.  agent p, you've got to get to that time machine and go back to the past, right before that giant tinfoil ball put you in a full body cast r 18 months.  that's when doofenshmirtz got the upper hand, and it's been downhill ever since.  this is our chance to fix it.  oh, wait. perry the platypus, change of plans.  instead of doing that, don't.  all right, see you later.  remember the oath.  curse that oath.   what. where's the time machine.  excuse me. where is everything from the museum.  it's all at the city dump, joe.  let's go.   back to the past. back to the past. back to the past.   looks like as good a spot as any to start a dump.  yeah. works for me.  wwait. what. are you me.  but i have to bustchange of plan. come on.  i'll explain later.  we can't let candace see us.  but i'm candace.  so am i.  oh, oh, oh.  mom. mom.  : aw. i was so cute.  why did you stop me.  i was just about to bust the boys.  no, that's just it.  i'm from a future where we did bust the boys.  really. how was it.  was it great.  no, it was awful.  the future gets all messed up.  oh, look.  : so that's how that happened.  get down.  look. look, look. see.  okay, i give up. what am i supposed to be looking at.  no. it's not possible.  i'm going to go get the cart.  it was right here.  and it was huge. mom.  wow. that future sounds horrible.  it was. trust me.  okay. but coming from anybody but myself, i wouldn't listen.  they're gone. let's get back to the time machine and get out of here.   okay, that was weird.  well, this machine is shot.  how are we going to get back.  : phenias and ferb.  okay, we're here.  are you happy now, candace.  yes. see, mom.  i told you they weren't there.  oh, hi, boys.  hi, mom.  come on, candace.  help me with the groceries.  bbbutlet's go.  hey, phenias, that was great.  way too cool.  that was awesome.  can we do it again.  sorry. only one ride per customer.  that was great, phineas.  oh, wait, wait, wait.  remember.  three, two, one.   wait, candace, you're grown up.  and there's two of you.  phineas, we're from the futuretwo alternative futures.  one that's good.  and one that's terrible.  someone should really fix that.  : we did.  the bad future no longer exists.  candaces: right.  well, if it doesn't exist, shouldn't the candace from the bad future cease to exist too.  oh, darn.  guys, i need your help.  the time machine i arrived in is smashed to pieces.  i'm stuck here, unless you guys can build me one.  ferb, isn't there an old time machine in the museum of natural history.  yes, that's the one you fix later this summer when we go to the museum.  it's the one i took back from the future but now it's destroyed.  okay. so the future time machine gets destroyed.  that means the one here in the present is raring to go.  we'll fix it, take you to the future, bring back the time machine and unfix it again.  so it will be ready to be fixed when we go to the museum the next time.  phineas, i'm a fully grown woman and i didn't understand any of that.  just trust me. come on.  wow. rollercoaster ride, now this.  bonus.  wait a minute.  you sure you can fix this time machine.  don't worry, candace.  we're almost done.  candace.  time machine.  ahha.  candace, meet candace.  awesome.  i finally have proof.  i'll take my older self, bring her to mom, mom will see the boys have invented some kind of time machine, and they'll be busted.  oh, i love you, me.  come on. let's go.  let's go see mom. come on.  wow. was i always this nuts.  candace, honey, get a hold of yourself.  i have no interest in busting the boys anymore.  what. but you're me.  you have to want to bust them, because i'm never going to stop wanting to bust them.  you know, sometimes getting what you want isn't what you need.  you'll find out as you mature.  phineas: ready.  : "you'll find out as you mature." candace, just relax.  everything works out.  twenty years into the future, here we come.    ahha. if you won't show my mom what's going on, i'll show your mom.  i'm all the proof that i need.  candace.  we'd better go and get her.  you know that whole spacetime continuum thing.  mom and dad's antique store.  yes. it's still here.  ooh, future.  mom, it's me, candace from the past.  i came here in a time machine that phineas and ferb borrowed from a museum.  you've got to bust them.  honey, what are you talkingcandace..  you're so young.   mom, you're so...  don't say it.  oh...  you don't have to say that word.  i mean it.  mom, you're so old.   hi, boys.  aren't you a little young to be time travelers.  yes. yes, we are.  a time machine.  does this mean that all those times you told me the boys were up to something...  they really were.  yes. yes. yes.  oh, honey, i am so sorry i didn't believe you.   i finally got them.  hello.  what.  aren't you going to bust them.  candace, my phineas and ferb are 30 years old now.  well, i suppose could call them, but phineas is in switzerland for the awards ceremony and ferb's still at camp david forbust them, young phineaand ferb.  i don't think i have jurisdiction over these guys anymore.   okay, but officially, on record, they are busted, right.  sure, candace. they're busted.  yes.  guys, we've seen how time travel can mess things up bigtime, so promise me you won't go into the future again.  yeah. maybe it is a bad idea.  just think, this all started because we needed a steel and wood fusing tool.  hey, candace, you never told us.  how do ferb and i turn out.  fantastic. just keep doing what you're doing.  and be nice to your sister.  yeah. be nice to your sister.  you guys coming or what.  where did you get that.  so that's uncle phineas and ferb as kids.  that's right.  and that girl looks like aunt isabella.  did you hear that.  aunt isabella.  that means i'm going to marry phineas.  or ferb.   phineus: let's go.  : bye.  looks like everything is back to normal.  wow, mom.  your brothers are so cool.  meanwhile, i'm stuck withhey.  where did they go.  xavier and fred.  what are you doing.  nothing.  see, mom.  they never do anything.  give it a rest, amanda.  oh, memories.  i know, huh.   oh, man. in 20 years you guys are so busted.  i guess that's a hollow victory.  but it proves you can be busted.  so i'm never going to give up.  never, never, never.  did i say never. yes, i did. never,
