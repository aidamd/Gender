 uh, musical instruments that start with " you get the idea. it's a long list.  i've been working on it for a while.  anyway, i realized i should build something that would make all those awful things disappear.  behold, perry the platypusshrinkspheria.  i was going to call it a shrinkinator, but i've done that whole "inator" thing before.  it's just been done to death.  bring him over here.  i want to show him how it works.  i enter the name of something i hate.  pelican. pelican.  and shrinkspheria hones in on its molecular structure and then turns all the particles into sparticles, thereby shrinking it into a teeny, tiny speck so small i never have to see it again.  so goodbye to you, perry the platypus.  enjoy your presidential suite.  ha ha ha ha ha ha.   glad you like the card, mom.  it's a simple postmodern fusion of origami and popup.  yeah, and just wait till you see your present.  ok. stay right there.  oh, i hope the boys don't go overboard with my present.  all i'd really like is that dress from that cute little sundress shop.  you mean that really cute one with the polka dots.  i know what she wants.  cute little sundress. cute little sundress.  cute little sundress.  hey, perry the platypus, ..  forever. ha ha ha ha ha.  yes. i'm an evil genius.  ha ha ha ha.  now i have to wait 4 minutes for it to recharge, i think i'll go with pelicans next.  pelicans

sundress perfect for our birthday queen to sip iced lattes while enjoying a faboo day in the sun.  huh. well, they have the wrong sundress.  it's ok, but it is not as great as this.  aah. aah.  candace. candace. where'd she go.  ow.   goodbye to musical instruments "  i can still give mom the one thing the boys can't, the gift of music played on my friend, the bass.  it's a good thing i play the banjo.  it's a good thing i play the bassoon.  it's a good thing i play the bugle.  it's a good thing i play the bongoes.  it's a good thing i play the balalaika.  it's a good thing i play the bagpipe.  i should've manned the omelet station.  candace, honey, come join us.  the boys have put together a little video.  yeah. here. you can do the honors.  fine. whatever.  phineas, on video: happy birthday, mom.  from birth to young adult to midsized adult, from the eighties to the ninties, mom enchants everyone she meets.  but who is this person we call mom.  uhh.   a house divided cannot stand.  yeah. what he said.  oh, perry the platypus, you melted their wax, but you can never melt what's insidepure evil.  ehh. i should have seen that coming.  we can't seem to get a break.  your breath smells like candles.  curse you, perry the platypus.   it's this wonderful.  yeah. really great.  but a true testament to what a great mom you are is that your daughter would take the time to write this song.   mom, it's your birthday    thanks for all the care and love you give   nice song, sis.   not to mention the meals    sometimes i get kind of nervous   come on.   and forget to tell you how i feel   boys:  shoobedoo, shoobedoo    i'm a little highstrung    it's just because i'm young    mom, i adore ya    and i'll do anything for ya    although my brothers make me frantic    with every single crazy antic    and when i'm bouncin' off the walls    you're the one who stays calm    you're the one who stays calm    because you love me for who i am    i'll always love you, mom    ooh    what a beautiful song, honey.  i only wish dad could have heard it.  well, i really wanted you to have a happy biroh, i almost forgot.  we set up a satellite uplink with dad.  ooh. a satellite uplink.  hello, love. happy birthday.  hi, honey. i miss you.  and you're missing the festivities.  the boys threw me the greatest party, and candace wrote me this really amazing song.  can you hear me.  oh, hey, perry. where have you been.  you missed all the fun.   mom: what a beautifulsummer day.  do you boys have anything exciting planned.  we're either gonna make this nuclearpowered submarine or this incredible shrinking ray, but for some reason, ferb and i can't seem to make up our minds.  well, i've made up my mind.  you two have the most wonderful imaginations.  it's real, you know.  what's real, dear.  the submarine, the shrinking raythey're really gonna build that stuff.  well, actually we haven't decided yet.  anyway, when i try to bust them, everything will just magically disappear.  always happens. you'll see.  well, you won't see. i'll see. trust me.  as usual, the imagination in this room is astounding.   hello.  hi, candace. it's jeremy.  i was wondering if you wanted to go for a walk today.  i would very much enjoy going for a walk.  wherever shall we go.  to my uncle's restaurant.  yes. that sounds doable.  why not pick me up around noon.  ok. goodbye.   guess who just called and asked me out on a date.  who. jeremy.   hold on. let's conference in jenny.    let's go outside.  submarine, shrinking ray.  i just can't make up my mind.  what ya doin'.  oh. hi, isabella.  hi, phineas.  you remember pinky.  oh, yeah. hi, pinky.  hey, check out my new sash.  it's got all my accomplishment patches sewn onto it.  see. wow.  that looks totally irreplacable.  pinky, i need that sash for a fireside girls ceremony this afternoon.  don't worry, isabella.  we'll get your sash back.  but how. it's in pinky's stomach.  hmm. ferb, you're a genius.  hey, where's perry.  agent "p," thanks for coming.  it's dr. doofenshmirtz.  he's been hiding out in the old abandoned vacuum cleaner factory.  you know, that building across town with the giant vacuum cleaner on top.  man, i can't believe that place closed.  i blame the internet.  but your mission, agent "p," is to find out what doofenshmirtz is up to and then stop him.  so how are we gonna retrieve my sash.  here. ferb made this mulitmedia presentation.  we shrink the sub downwith ferb and me in it and put inin pinky's dog food.  after he eats us, the sub extrudes 2 mechanical arms, which fold up the sash to microscopic size and pull it into the sash storage unit.  finally we pilot up into the mouth and have pinky drool us out. easy.  gross. but cool.  but pinky will eat anything but dog food.  he likes grilled cheese sandwiches.   we'll make the sub.   ok, a subatomic shrinking module, hydrostatic ballast tank, sign here, please.  aren't you wondering if we're a little young to be building a submarine.  yes. yes, i am.  yeah. we get that a lot.  one grilled cheese sandwich hot off theoh.  cool.  hey, isabella. you're just in time.  you guys amaze me.  when we're inside, we'll activate the shrinkage.  you take care of the rest.  check it out, pinky.  your favorite.  ready.  it worked.  all right, pinky winky, time for some cheesy weesy.     no. pinky. chasing the cat is so cliche.  you're better than that.  listen up.  jeremy will be here any second.  i wanna tell youooh. grilled cheese.  might as well eat now so i don't look like a pig on my date.   doofenshmirtz abadoned vacuum cleaner factory   iyou know, we always do the same thing.  i have a scheme. you try to stop me.  i trap you. i tell you my scheme. you escape.  then we fight, and i'm defeated.  let's mix it up a little.  i will tell you my scheme first, and then i will trap you. what do you say.  huh.  ok, so here it is.  the makeupyourmindinator.  you know, when you're waiting to order a pizza and the person in front of you can't decide on a topping.  ohh. i hate that. i hate it.  ii will destroy anyone who can't make up their mind.   destroy anyone who can't make up their mind.  ferb and i can't seem to make up our minds.  should i go with makeupyourmindinator, or is that too on the nose.  it's funny. now i can't make up my mind.  perry the platypus, well, iwell, ii did not see that coming.  calling headquarters, huh.  yes, youyou didn't even give me a chance to trap you.  i was goingto put you in that giant snow globe over there.  now i have to return it.  agent "p," what's wrong.  oh. you caught doofenshmirtz, huh.  that's weird.  usually he traps you.  then you escape andwe mixed it up a little.  hang tight, agent "p." backup is on the way.  i mean, it would be if we had some.  uh, i'm gonna make some calls.  oh, yeah. this is good.  it worked.  pinky's chewing.  prepare for swallowing.     phineas: whoa.  whaah.   wow. pinky's neck is really long.  hey, candace.  hi, jeremy.  whoa.   heh heh. heh. excuse me.  we did it, ferb. we're inside pinky.  how about a little road trip music.    just the two of us    in an esophagus    it's time to get this mission

you're goin' my way    you'll see what i mean    hang a left at the spleen   now to find that sash.  hey, tacos.  ah, tacos.  you know who makes the best tacos. mom.  these kind of remind me of the ones we had for dinner last night.  hey, pinky didn't have dinner with us.  wait a minute.  candace's favorite cereal.   hello.  pinky ran away, and when i came back,the sandwich was gone.  ok, let me call you back.  yeah. we're inside candace's stomach.  that's creepy on so many levels.   this backup of yours is taking forever.  i have a travel chess set in my bag over there.  do you play chess. over there, actually.  ha ha. ha ha.  i tricked you, perry the platypus.  do you like my anyflatsurface magnet belt.  it sticks to any flat surface.  hee hee hee hee.  there's no travel chess set in this bag either.  there was one of these in both bags, so whichever one you chose, ..  stuck right now.  what, uhwhwhat time is that backup getting here again.  let's tap into candace's nerve center so we can see what she sees.  ears. eyes.  look. we're getting an image.  she's on her date with jeremy.  that means we're on a date with jeremy.  again, creepy on so many levels.   oh, excuse me. my
