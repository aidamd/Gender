you know, something bit half of it off.  so here's my evil plan.  with this remote, i will open the danville dam, flooding all the streets and creating beautiful waterways.  like the canals in venice, italy.  or to a lesser extent, venice, california.  but how will people get around.  they will have to buy my latest invention.  it's like a car, but it can drive on the surface of water.  behold. yolike it.  i call it the buoyancy or boat for short.  everyone will want one.   yeah, i see what you're saying, but you don't have an argument.  they're giving you 12 cans a day.  technically, you're

up his alley.  useless shoelace facts volume 8.  the plastic or metal tip on the end of a shoelace is called an "aglet." aglet.  "it is one of the most useful, yet tragically ignored inventions in all of history." gosh, ferb, that seems like a great injustice, huh.  oh, well.  thanks, baljeet.  dad: okay. aglet.  brilliant.  oh, hi, boys.  aglet, mom.  aglet you too, phineas.  no, mom, the shoelace tip.  it's an aglet.  how interesting.  yeah. nobody seems to know the word.  i wonder why.  i'll tell you why.  because it doesn't matter.  you can live a long life without knowing the tip of the shoelace is calledphineas: aglet.  it doesn't matter.  ferb, i know what we're gonna do today.  oh, look at this, honey.  twentyseven across, five letters: "where's blank."  agent p, doofenshmirtz has crippled the entire worldwide internet by spreading a socalled viral video over the whole planet.  watch carefully, agent p.  what you are about to see may be the masterstroke of an evil genius who has distracted us with smaller schemes while secretly moving us into checkmate.  i am a superstar.    doofenshmirtz: it won't stop flushing.  agent p, this is no laughing matter.  we need you to find out what he's up to and stop him.  behind you, rising dramatically from the floor, is a new hightech device.  it's called a universal delete button.  it can delete any file on the internet from every computer on the planet.  karl: haha.  it won't stop flushing.  karl, i told you, there's nothing funny about a man in his underwear skating into a toilet.  karl: of course, sir.  now, limericks.  limericks are funny.  the reason we've called you all here today is to raise awareness for the aglet.  what's an aglet.  ferb, enlighten us.   phineas: the aglet.  isabella: oh, that's what it's called.  our goal is to bring to the world's attention.  first, we'll use these shoelaces to make chic aglet awareness ribbons.   never forget the aglet.  you are going to waste a whole day promoting aglets.  who is going to care.  if you diss aglets one more time, i'll fray your head so bad, it won't fit through your shirthole.  aglets, yay.   hey, candace.  the more you know about aglets, the better your life's gonna be.  no one's life will be made better knowing the whateveryoucallit.  aglet.  what did you say.

the shoelace tip.  it's an aglet.  i can hear.  well, it seems to be working.  let's take it to the next level.  oh, the part when the guy rollerskated into the toilet. haha.  uh, that was sort of the only part, but, yeah, i was dying.  i mean, everyone in the whole world saw that video.  i wish there was a viral video of me singing going around the world.  i bet you'd become an instastar.  yeah, an instastar.  yeah.  you'd be bigger than aglets.  wait, what.  why do you know that word.  aglets are so in right now.  look.   hey, guys. i, uh, just wanted to see if you'd come with me to the big aglet concert.   monogram : agent p, your halo jump is a go.  go. go. go. jump.and fall.  keep falling.  and keep being a platypus.  visualize it.  you're a falling plat  did you ever have an old box of junk that's just been sitting in the attic forever, and you think, "i bet i could just get rid of this whole box, "and my life would go on completely unaffected "by the loss of whatever may be inside, like for instance, an old forgotten video tape made in high school." look in the box, perry the platypus.  always look in the box.  mom.  candace.  what's wrong.  phineas and ferb are increasing public awareness of the shoelace tip thing.  who knew people could get so worked up over aglets.  no.   phineas: candace.  aren't you gonna come sing at the big aglet concert.  you may have infected everyone else with shoelacetip madness, but not me.  they don't matter.  bummer. it's gonna be broadcast all over the world.  you could become an instastar.  okay, but th uh, touch.  doofenshmirtz: this video is ruining my life, perry the platypus.  i can't even go outside my own evil lair.  man: hey, look.  it's that idiot from the video.   and that's just my kitchen.  what's this.  a universal delete button.  thank you, perry the platypus.  sorry, but deleting the video from every computer in the world isn't good enough.  i have to erase it from people's minds too.  behold.  the readmymindinator.  you see, whatever i think of appears on this screen in front.  see. see, if i just hook it up to your universal delete button like this...  voil.  now, whatever i think
