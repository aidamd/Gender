 whoohoo.  yes, yes, yes.  no, no, no, no.  aah.  well, here we are.  we've reached the final hole.  you'd better put on your dancing shoes.     . steppin' on the greens . in her designer jeans . she's a disco miniaturegolfing queen . wearin' plaid and s dco . she can dance and sing and really shake her thing . she's a disco miniaturegolfing queen . she's a disco miniaturegolfing queen .  poor stacy.  what was i thinking.  ok, candace.  looks like it's up to you.   ahh. this is nice, eh.  but, you know, i don't think suburban life is for me.  i'm thinking of just adding a breakfast nook and flipping the property.  the main problem is my neighbor, phil.  he is truly diabolical.  his fruit falls into my yard, his dog poops on my lawn, he leaves his trash cans out too long and...  oh, i'm at my wit's end.  and the worst, the absolute worst, is his leaf blower.  ok, that's it.  time to end this once and for all.  and no one is stopping me.  behold, perry the platypus.  the ultimate suburban weapon: the atomic leaf blowerinator.  this will be the last time his stray leaves blow onto my lawn.  yah. aahh.  turn it off.  turn it off.  good, just like i planned.  now, i'll blow every leaf onto his property.  hahahahahahaha.  at least the golf course can't vanish if they're still in it. come on, mom.  curse you, phil the neighbor.   candace, what are you doing out of bed.  wasn't stacy taking care of you.  she was seduced by the coolness.  follow that miniature golf course.  what does that even mean.  look behind you.  i don't see anything.  you know you should've been setting aside a portion of your profits over the years with the understanding that that money would be used to upgrade your investment.  what did you think.  a shiny, new miniature golf course would just fall out of the sky.  you'd be surprised what falls out of the sky in danville.  oh, isn't that great.  they remodeled little duffers.  i still don't know how we ended up at little duffers.  i don't know why we didn't build it here in the first place.  oh, there you are, perry.  candace.  did you hear. i won.  i actually won in miniature golf.  it just goes to show you that if you focus, you can accomplish anything.  achooo.  sorry, i forgot to bust your brothers.  it's ok.  i'm sorry i got you sick.  you know what we're going to do today, torbo.  it's time to test the teleport.  eureka.  now i can teleport myself anywhere in the world.  wouldn't you have to take one of those teleport things there first.  oh, but then you'd already be there.  it kinda renders the whole thing redundant, doesn't it.  do you want me to remove your tongue again, torbo.  cool.  i know what we can do today, ferb.  no, not the tongue thing.  the teleporter.  hey, boys.  hey, mom.  ferb and i are gonna build a teleport device.  oh, great. i wish you could teleport to where my earrings are.  i've lost them.  the dangly smoky topaz or the hoops.  hoops.  oh, she must be wearing the blue dress.  we'll keep an eye out for 'em.  come on, ferb.  we're burnin' daylight.  teleports completed.  hey, where's perry.    ew. you're not supposed to be here.   i told phineas and ferb to keep you outta my room.  i'm gonna give them a piece of my mind.  mom.  do you know where phineas and ferb are.  they're in the garage, honey.  oh, by the way, jeremy's gonna be here soon.  please try not to embarrass me in front of him again.  what do you mean, again.  remember my fifthgrade graduation with the inflatable oh, that's right.  my bad.  this is a glorious day for mankind.  ready with the camera so we can document it.  cheese.  how many times have i told you to keep perry out of my room.  what are those.  teleports.  pretty cool, huh.  you guys are so bus aah.  cool. it worked.  candace. are you ok.

teleport at the same time must have switched your brains.  oh, you think.  you guys better change me back now or i'll...  wait.  jeremy's gonna be here soon.  not a problem, sis.  we'll just put you both through the teleporter again.  hey, where's perry.  uh, ii mean candace.  i mean perry in candace's body.   . doobydooby doo ba doobydooby doo .ba doobydooby doo .  i wonder where he scampered off to.  any ideas, ferb.  whatcha doin'.  hey, isabella. we built a teleportation device and accidentally switched candace and perry's brains.  really. that's so cool.  you wouldn't think it was so cool if you smelled like this.  we're looking for perry so we can switch them back to normal.  wanna help.  you betcha.  karl.  how many times have i told you, lift the seat when you're done.  sorry.  oh, there you...  uhoh.  karl, i think we have a breach of security.  what do you mean, sir.  there's a teenage girl in here.  a teenage girl.  agent p, brilliant disguise.  man. i thought it was a

baby movies of candace.   ohh.  there she is in the bathtub.   oops. little bubbles.   mom. remember what we talked about.  my fifthgrade graduation.  fifthgrade graduation.  what is she talking

well, i'm out of here.  what just happened.  you're such a nice boy, jeremy.  i can see why candace built a shrine to you in her room.  oopsy.  i probably shouldn't have said that.  thanks for feeding perry while i look for my earrings.  sure, no problem.  what's in the platypus food anyway.  mostly worms and insect larvae.   oh, perry. now i have to get the carpet cleaned again.  hey, maybe i lost my earrings when i was folding candace's laundry.  why don't you help me look while you wait, jeremy.  am i sweating milk.  being a platypus is so gross.  wait, wait. i can'ti can't fight when you're dressed as a girl.  it's so...como se dice...  awkward.  look. shoes on sale.  curse you, perry the teenager.   . agent p .  hey. the girl missing her platypus found slushy the clown.  yay.  this is horrible.  mom is inside, ruining my love life.   oh, there you are, perry.  great. change me back now.  so this is how you went through the first time, right.  you were holding perry.  yes, yes, yes,

shrinkinator.  i suppose i should've unplugged it before i turned it into a planter.  come on, mom, hurry up.  you're busted.  see, see.  it's right there.  oh, my goodness.  did you make these.  uh... yeah.  these are so much nicer than the ones i lost.   awesome.  thanks, boys.  close your mouth, honey.  you'll catch flies.   . she's a semineurotic . teenage girl of action . doobydooby doo ba doobydooby doo . she's a foxy little redhead with a platypus' brain . you best leave her alone . she's playing mp3s on her palm . and whenever she's around . you can hear the bad guys say great. now i have this song stuck in my head.  . she's perry . perry the teenage girl .  .  .     hee hee hee hee.    aaaaahh.    aaaahhhh.     kid versus kat versus kid versus kat...  upon ay, rjved a camp of hungry ogres.  one nht tsawran unbele sight.  rere wimazing foo ogre had ever ld 3+re [) everybody stay together.  welcome to the funnest place on earth, boys...  the bootsville museum.  nothing like a day of history to get the brain juices flowing.  oooh. gladiators.  it's going to be a long day.  but a long day without kat.   hee hee.  ah, must be my bracelet.  hey, we've got the same bracelet.  how come yours set off the detector and mine didn't.  maybe mine is more metally.  lorne and harley put those spears back.  those aren't pretty pony dolls.  please.  we're here to learn not to have fun.  not to have fun.  why ms. brannigan, history is wall to wall fun.  oh really, mr. burtonburger.  well maybe you want to teach the class.  could i.  well, it's not that igreat.  ok kids, these here are the weapons of the roman gladiator.  armed only with a trident and a net.  hey. keep your hands off those.  besides you're holding it wrong.    skewer him, mr.  burtonburger.   mraow.   hisss.   you snuck kat in..  maybe. but if you tell on me, i'll tell dad you snuck downstairs and ate all the cookies last night.  i didn't do that.  oh, well it was worth a try.  please don't tell, coop.  mr. kat will stay in my backpack, i promise.   hey. keep your paws inside the ride.  just make sure kat stays in there.  wherever he goes, trouble follows ... for me.  of course he will.  what's there to do in a boring old museum anyway.  the romans used these sharp swords to battle each other to the death.   then the gladiators would jump into chariots and race around fighting.  ms. brannigan, coop's dad is like the coolest school chaperone ever.  yeah, it's like i'm not even learning stuff.  whoo hoo.  he's... uh, enthusiastic all right.  actually, chariot races were more like car races, except the chariots had mechanical horses and steampowered jet packs.  kids: oooohhh. wow.  jet packs. come on.  we've got bigger problems than historical inaccuracies. look.   leave me alone, doggie.  meow.   no.  whew. that would have been blamed on me for sure.    uh ... whoops.  unhh.  stay close to me, coop.  do you have any idea what that urn costs.  guard: now the trex as you can see had short stubby arms and this was so...  so he could keep his poker hand hidden from his opponents.  pfft. that's ridiculous.  the trex never played poker.  he was a great beast who would tear apart his victims.  and with his arms he...   ...he would tickle his prey into submission.   dinosaurs are supposed to be scary, not tickle monsters.  you want scary.  there's a lot of sharp things in this museum a certain kat can use... on us.  there he is.   coop: there's that guard dog.  i've got an idea.  what do you have in your lunch.  um... a mushy banana peanut butter baloney sandwich.   here poochy poochy poochy.      get him, boy.  the dinosaurs would lure them ia trap using pizza as bait then devour the cave men whole.  impossible.  they never existed at the same time.  how could any dinosaur have had pizza.   agh.    looks like that one just made dinner out of coop.  nerdburgers again.   meow.  that's ridiculous.  there's no such thing as 'egyptian daddies'.  oh really.  then who lived with the mummies, genius.  hey coop.  isn't that your sister in one of those egyptian comic strips.  huh.  careful. )
