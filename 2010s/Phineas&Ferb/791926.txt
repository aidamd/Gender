here, justjust like i planned.  obviously.  so let me tell you my latest scheme.  i'm so tired of all these happy couples around me, romantic and laughing, mocking me with their happiness.  well, not anymore.  my delovenator satellite will eliminate the feeling of love in the entire tristate area.  all i have to do is press this button.  it would be so easy to press it right now.  it would be so simple, but, you know, i've got a date tonight, and i like to stay optimistic.  but if we don't hit it off, i'm definitely gonna ruin it for everyone else.    hi.  hi. ready.  candace: i'm so looking forward to tonight.  a special evening, just the two of us.  what do you have planned.  horseback riding.  i just love horseback riding.  oh, you stopped.  tada.  your brothers have opened the trendiest restaurant in town.  and this is where i'm taking you.  oh. uh, really. heh.  how...fun.  well, iif you prefer to do something else...  well...  platypusthemed restaurants are so now, so wow.  it will be a miracle if we get in.  cool.  let's definitely eat here.  but no way are we waiting in this line.  i practically own the place.  come on.  outta my way, people.  vip coming through.  all right, buford, make with the rope and let us in.  name.  it's me.  me who.  i'm candace.  candace flynn.  you're not on the list.  you should have made a reservation yesterday.  this restaurant didn't exist yesterday.  i demand to be let in right now.  good evening, sir.  oh, i forgot to make a reservation.  no problem, dude.  did that guy just bribe you.  he didn't bribe me.  he just caught my attention in a monetary fashion.  now, back in line.  right this way to your table, sir.  hey, isabella.  have you seen perry.  no, not lately.  hm.  so i noticed in your online profile that you say you like tall men.  is. is. is that true.  that's right.  and you're not very tall at all.  well, ii'm 6'2". i slouch.  my last date was 6 foot 9.  now, that's a goodlooking man.  but i'll be honest, i've never been able to resist a man in a lab coat.   really. look.  look, i'm wearing one right now.  hey. there you are, perry.  we've gotta put you in your place of honor.  i'm usually extremely attracted to blonds.  ii see.  but there is something about your windblown style that gives me goose bumps.  really.  well, ii must say, it's quite a bit of work in the morning, you know, but apparently worth it.  there you go, perry.  now everyone can see you.    hey, ferb. we need a chicken special for table 5.    enjoy your meal.  really. you're letting complete strangers in.  i'm the owners' sister.  i demand to be let in right now.  i'm supposed to be having the time of my life.  candace. i really don't mind waiting a bit.  it's actually kinda fun just hanging out here with you.  oh, really.  buford: all right, next party, step this way.  oh, come on.  so how do you feel about evil.  huh. that's a weird question.  is it.  ii'm just making conversation.  but i love it.  look.  you have an evil tattoo.  look, look, just like mine.  i can't believe we have so much in common.  yyou know, i don't even put "evil" on my profile anymore because it attracts so many weirdos.  don't i know it.  that's it.  i'm calling mom and making her tell the boys to let us in.  mom, phineas and ferb made an exclusive restaurant in the yard and you've got to tell them to tell buford to let us in.  okay, okay, honey.  we're just finishing dinner.  we'll be home in a minute.  argh.  jeremy, hold our place in line.  i'm going out front to wait for my mom.  but candace...  perry the platypus.  oh, looking for my remote, are you. well, here.  take it.  i don't need it anymore.  i am in love.  sven, i heard a trendy new badger restaurant just opened up the street.  hipster guy: cool.  boy: ooh, badger restaurant.  i love badgers.  platypusthemed restaurants are so four hours ago.  let's bail.  cool.  boy: i haven't eaten badger in a week.   ah, the public is fickle.  excuse me, young men.  i'd like to buy your restaurant.  i envision a chain of platypusthemed restaurants as far as the tristate area can see.  heck, dinner service is over.  you can have it.   mom. dad. the boys have a restaurant in the yard, and they're not letting me in.  you've gotta put a stop to it.  come on.   jeremy: goodbye.  phineas: restaurant.  uh, guys.  ugh, whatever.  excuse me, miss.  do you have a table for two.  heeheehee.  right this way, sir.   enjoy.  you know, candace, i've had a lot of fun in your backyard, but this is the best time yet.   oh, look.  how adorable.  candace, you
