help.  stacy said that jeremy got me the perfect gift.  i thought you alreadygot a gift for jeremy.  i did, but if his gift to meis perfect and my gift to him isn't, he's gonna be sohurt and insulted and he'll stop liking me.  ,  candace, honey, i don't think...  you poor thing.   forgive me, boys. what are your brothers up to.  not a thing.what are they up to.  , love you, mom. got to run. bye.  plow.   house.  , those two are so busted.  for lollygagging in bed.  well, hardly lollygagg we've been working on a way to seize the day while also not having to get out of bo early.  i think we can cross that one off our todo list.  let me see that. number one was write letters to, santa.   letters to santa. that's for little kids.  santa's not just for little kids, candace.  okay, fine. let's assume there is a santa claus...  well, of course there is.  there's been a ton of reported sightings, not to mention the santa cloth found in istanbul, 1912.  , santa's one of our biggest heroes.  talk about making the most out of one day.  imagine flying around the whole world delivering toys and gifts to everybody in one night.  again, let's assume there is a santa claus.  he's got it easy.  the hard part is trying to figure out wh,at to give people when they don't write you a letter telling you exactly what they want most.  and by "people," i mean "jeremy," and by "you," i mean "me" and...  no, the rest is et much literal.  well, i'm sure jeremy would get exactly what he wanted if he wrote his own letter to santa.   , letters to santa.  wait, that's it. i'll trick jeremy into writing a letter to santa so i can sneak a peek and learn what he wants straight from the horse's mouth.  or you can ask him what he wants  you are such a child sometimes.  you know, ferb, just think of all the wonderful things santa does, for us, and he never asks for anything in return.  wait, that's it. ferb, are you thinking what i'm thinking.  as usual, we're...   man, no. that's not at all what i was thinking.  oh, dude.  yeah, that's it. i'll call in the troops.  you wonder where perry is.  , . fa la la la la lala .  hello.  wintertime's fun.  come on, follow me.  man: plow.  ,  .   ah, agent p. there you are. merry christmas.  great. you brought snacks.  wintertime's fun.  follow me.  secret santa time.   ,ah. here you are.   you lucked out, agent p. your secret santa has exquisite taste.  criminy, karl, it's supposed to be a secret santa.  what. no, i didn't get it for him.   right. no, really, i didn't.  , the more you protest, the more we know you gave it to him.  fine, think what you want. whatever.   okay, scrooge. we got it.   uhoh.  sorry, agent p. i guess evil never takes a holiday.  if you'll direct your attention to thecreen.  morning, agent p. a wise man once said...  , eyes on the screen.  a wise man once said, "evil never takes a holiday." we don't know what doofenshmirtz is up to, but get to the bottom of it.   hello.  happy christmas eve, my little drummer boy.  you know, i don't play drums., i play guitar.  i know, silly billy.  i just thought it was the perfect day to show some christmas spirit.  let's get together and write letters to santa and be very specific within a reasonable price range. for fun.  writing letters to santa claus.   letters tooh. brilliant idea. i'll be over in a bit.  candace, this isn't one of these t,hings...    he doesn't suspect a thing.  phineas: awesome. phase one complete.  hey, guys.  cool clubhouse.  oh, no. this is not, how you say, a clubhouse.  this is the ultimate rest and relaxation lounge , perfectly tailored to the jolly, rubenesque world traveler.  it's a rest stop for santa.  oh. i see. why did you not just say that.  remember when you wrote letters to santa asking him for presents.  all: yes.  did you always get the presents you asked for.  all: pretty much, yes.  , of course.  now, did you ever write a thankyou note to santa.  all: well, no, but nobody ever told...   no.  well, i think it's time someone did something cool for santa to show him we appreciate everything he does for us.  ,so we're gonna turn the entire city of danville into a giant, shimmering thankyou card to santa claus.  so, what you're saying is it's not a clubhouse.  . doofenshmirtz evil incorporated .  ah, perry the platypus. i have a present for you.  , and by "present," of course, i mean "trap." look how festive you are. wait, wait. hold on.  . and a partridge on a perry .  ...the platypus.  now, behold. ,the naughtyinator.  when activated, the naughty nectar in these giant glass cylinders will create a massive charge cloud of pure naughtiness.  when santa then checks his list, everyone in the tristate area will appear to be naughty, effectively canceling christmas.  there's just one, tiny little blemish on my otherwise perfect plan.  i don't actually have a problem with christmas.  there's no tragic, holidayrelated backstory in my past.  christmas was always fine growing up.  you see, unlike every other evil scientist, , i don't hate christmas.  there are plenty of other holidays i can't stand.  for example...  wait. wait, hold on. one second. i can't get this...  for example...  .  . you see, valentine's is torture .  . and my birthday is a mess .  . new year's is a lot of noise and arbor day's a pest .  , . halloween's a horror but i guess i must confess .  . that i really don't hate christmas .  . now it isn't that i like it at the most i feel ambivalence .  . but should i really just destroy it. .  . i'll admit that i'm still on the fence .  . it makes me tense .  . from the evil scientist co,mmunity i'm sure to get ejected .  . but for christmas i can't seem to summon any true invective .  . because what is there to hate. .  . i mean, it's really so subjective .  . no, i really don't hate christmas. .  oh, what the heck. kick line.  . no, i really .  . no, i really don't hate christmas. .  , i have an intense, burning indifference.  i didn't even create the naughtyinator myself.  the plans were mailed to me from borneo, is rumored to be in hiding.  it's really a sweet gift, but how can i destroy christmas without having a good reason.   well, i guess i have no choice...  ...but to sit and wait for a reason.  um, all right, everyone.  grab yours,elvessome decorations and let's getour grateful on.  .  . so warm by the fireplace we glow .  . all cozy and happy .  . i hang all the stockings in a row with you .  , . i've got the christmas feeling .  . i take it everywhere i go .  . and make that christmas feeling grow .  . it feels like christmas .  . christmas . . christmas .  , . come on, i know you don't wanna miss this .  . let's make that christmas feeling grow .  hello, my little rednosed reindeer.  ready to write our letter to santa. in a minute, candace.  , i'm right in the middle here.  i was thinking maybe you could help me finish decorating.  no. it'll be too late. the stores will all be closed.  and by "stores," i mean "the post office," and by "buying a gift," i mean "mailing the letters." you didn't say "buying a gift." oh, good. that would've been a dead giveaway.   hey, everyone, the next decoration delivery is here. the tinsel.  , but wait. we have to write them quickly.  i already licked the stamps.  you know, all i really want for christmas is the ability to hate christmas.   were you expecting someone.  . we wish you a merry christmas .  , . now bring us some figgy pudding .  "bring us figgy pudding." well, you could say "please," but, you know, whatever.  great. figgy pudding.  . we won't go until we get some we won't go until we get some .  . so bring some right here .  what. are you threatening me.  how dare you.  no one barges in,to my home and demands desserts.  well, if that's how things are, i have my reason to push this button.  so long, christmas. you're feliz navidead to me.   see. it's... that was spanish.  ,  'tis the season to be naughty.  can i at least get a diet soda.  whoa. is it me, or does the sky look ,really dark and ominous, as if it's foadowing events which will have a negative impact on our lives.  i'm sorry, kids.  it looks like everyone in danville , got a return on their letters to santa.  they've all been stamped "naughty." santa thinks everyone in danville's been naughty.  now that's just nonsense.  but... but how can that be.  oh, well, let's see.  what's different this year than last year.  oh, i know.  you went out and got everyone in danville involved i,one of your offthecuff, harebrained schemes.  you think this could be my fault.  who can say, really.  but, you know, sometimes we do naughty things without ever having any idea they're naughty.  sometimes we do an entire summer's worth of them.  , could this be true.  oh, no. i mean, how could...  well, i guess it...  both: maybe. i am cold.  ,,,,xl, been sir.  we've saved people a lot of money on car insurance.  feels nice going into the holidays.  ...  , will you marry me.  oooh, helzberg diamonds.  yeah, well he must have saved some money with geico.  reminds me of the gecko mating call.  really. how does that go.  shoo be doo be doo.  15 minutes could save you 15% or more , ,,,,@, christmas time,smartphones free.  share minutes for free whenyou add a smartphone to a family shareplan.  and now, buy an lg vortexand get one free.  ,,,, christmas has been canceled in the city of d,anville.  it was all a bad dream.  christmas wasn't canceled.  phineas. no matter how many times you try that, it's not going to work.  besides, the mall closes in 20 minutes.  i got this system, see.  you act any way you want all year long, but then right before christmas, you do one big selfless act of kindness , )
