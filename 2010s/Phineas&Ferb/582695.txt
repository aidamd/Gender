new puppeteer in town.  his name was hans, and his hands were huge.  we called m huge hands hans.  his puppetry was garbage, but unfortunately, it was good enough for my fraulein.  i lost her to a boy with bigger fingers, and i never did a shadow puppet again.  until tonight.  hehhehheh.  and when the sunises in one hour see, rig over there then everyone in the tritate area will see my enormous hand shadows on the moon.  there she is.  uhh, this isn't good.  candace, youe in decing orbit.  what does that even mean.  you ju need to g to the spacest on the hook behind you.  ok.  now put it on.
