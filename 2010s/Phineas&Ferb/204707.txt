platypus, you will finally understand ..  back in gimelstob in the days of my youth, the doofenshmirtz's were a proud family.  but those were lean times for my father, and our beloved lawn gnome was repossessed.  who will protect our zatzenfruit garden from witch's spells and wood trolls.  from a tender age, my father decided that it would be me.   while the other children played kick the shtupa and ate dunkelberries, i would stand for hours.   all through the cold night, ..  ..  and my neighbor kenny.   and since my lawn gnome was taken away from me, i will destroy every lawn gnome in the entire tristate area.  behold the destructinator.  and now, perry the platypus, to activate my creation.  no.  surf contest.  out of my way, jennabelle.  hello, buford. perhaps you missed the sign.  buford: "no bullying, no yodelling".   i don't like this any more than you do.  announcer: first up in the surf contest is bobby nelson.  oh, and nelson eats it on a 5footer.  and there's jango brown shooting a curl.  and here comes buford von stomp. oh.  he pummels brown with a philadelphia traffic stop.  and now he's got him in a half nelson.  and now he's actually beating him with bobby nelson.  here's the scores from our judges, and buford doesn't like it one bit.  next up is phineas flynn, and it's great to see a young surfer show such confidence.  uhoh. what's this.  oh, those kids today and their holographic projections.  he's in the pipeline. now he's hanging 10.  he's hanging 20. he's hanging 32.  now he's just hanging. the crowd loves it.  i don't think there's a name for that.  the crowd is doing the wave, and phineas is surfing it.  let's go to the judges.  10 to the fifth power, infinity, and oh.  it seems phineas flynn's radical surfing has made judge number 3 rethink einstein's theory of relativity.  cowabunga, laws of nature.  so, are you having fun.    girl    the moment has arrived    just one second.  hello.  um, candace. is everything ok.  oh, everything is

second boy:.  candace, tell me the truth.  what is going on here.   phineas and ferb built a beach in the backyard, just like they said they were going to.  but instead of just a cute little beach in their sandbox, it turned out to be this absolutely huge beach, with a coastline and palm trees and a pier nd hula dancers and water skiers and tiki huts and dolphins and dancing and surfing, and everybody from the neighborhood showed up.  oh.  candace: and then i was just about to share a smoothie with jeremy when a coconut dropped on my head andand just for moment, it seemed that the wily buford would steal away the coveted surfing trophy from under the noses of our heroes.  candace: but i can only continue my benign reign and spread love, happiness, and ultimate popularity throughout my kingdom if you would just let me have my moment.   oh, there you are, perry.   well, everybody, looks like that's all for today.  all: phineas and ferb. phineas and ferb.  phineas and ferb.  if you don't believe me, go see for yourself.  that was great.  mom: hey, boys. hey, mom.  so, how was your day at the beach.  candace: wait, wait. my kingdom.  my jeremy. it was all so beautiful.  .
