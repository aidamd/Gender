"big laundry."  "big laundry." it's crazy.  i'm a crazy person.   okay.  candace, since it's your first day and you're understandably eager to impress old captain webber, i'll give you another chance.  thank you, captain webber.  don't worry, from now on i'll be okay.   okay.  at least the beach is empty now.  it makes our lives a lot easier.  woman: hey, is this where they saw nosey.  man 1: come on.  man 2: you bring the camcorder.  candace: so many people.  don't worry, candace.  just stick with me and i'll get you through this, okay.   okay.  jeremy, we're gonna have to move you down to station 7 to cover this crowd, okay.  uh, okay.   okay.  candace, you stay here.  what.  wait... by myself.  but...  man 1: let's be unsafe.  man 2: i'm gonna run with scissors.  woman: i brought some glass to the beach.  phineas: here, nosey, nosey, nosey.  hey, look, ferb.  it's a red herring.  i say we follow it and see where it leads us.   what was that.    check the perimeter cameras.   without the cameras down here, we're...  blind.  computer voice: emergency power on.  so much for getting proof.  what was that.  did we find the lake nose monster.  no.  it found us.    okay, ferb, fire it up.   cool.  that's weird.  all the cameras are still down.  it's gonna be much harder to get proof that nosey exists now.  you man the starboard window, i'll go portside.   we'll see who spots nosey first.   i win.  stay calm.   no sudden movements.  okay, try panicking and making a lot of sudden movements.   phineas: i don't think nosey was attacking us at all.  he was just going after the cameras.  he must not want the world to know he really exists.  it was either back up the fire escape or lose the pants altogether.  then, suddenly it hit me.  ow. hey, watch it, brats.  no. you're supposed to bury everything except the head.  hey, no. we do not drink the lake water.  that goes for your children too, sir.  excuse me. my daddy came to see nosey, but i'm scared.  is he really coming back.  aw, i don't know, sweetie.  i was being silly before and overreacted.  sometimes we see things that aren't really there, but don't worry, i promise i'll protect you if...  i...see...  the lake nose monster.   quick, kid, run as fast as your legs can carry you.  follow the train tracks north.  you should hit ackerton by sundown. blend in.  it's a college town.  get a job and save up enough for a bus ticket to the canadian border.  someone will get in touch.  bob: candace.  is this your lake nose monster.  huh.  surprise.  you're in big trouble, young man.   okay.  just a little prankster.  we're safe.  i thought you said this would be funny.  it is. you got in trouble.   )
