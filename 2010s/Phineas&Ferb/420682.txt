    ugh, no more peach and pumpernickel sandwiches before bed.    you.   for an animal that doesn't do much, you sure know how to make a mess of things.    good morning, agent p.  i've got bad news and good news.  the bad news is, you're being reassigned to a new, more evil villain.  his name: the regurgitator.  we keep pushing him down, but he keeps coming back up.  that's not funny, carl.  it's just disgusting.  you laughed earlier.  it was a pity laugh.  anyway, dr. doofenshmirtz had to be downgraded to minor threatstatus, and we've just assigned agent s to his case.  the good news is, you're being relocated away from your host family to this new family in the quadstate area.  carl: psst.  it's the other way around, sir.  oh, yes, yes.  of course.  the bad news is the relocation, and the good news is the new villain thing.  just make sure you take your belongings from the house when you leave.  good morning, candace.  what's so great about it.  not much.  we can't find perry anywhere.  he's never missed breakfast, not even once.  uh, you don't think he could have argued with someone at say, 3:38 a.m., gotten his feelings hurt, then run away, do you.  nah, he never would have gone outside on purpose.  everybody knows platypuses are supposed to stay inside at night.  you haven't seen him anywhere, have you.  well, maybe he just wandered off.  doesn't he always wander off at some point in the day.  aaand then later when he comes back, you say "oh, there you are, perry." and he says, "grr." yeah, but he's always here in the morning.  i'd be devastated if something happened to him.   . doofenshmirtz evil incorporated .   hold on, i'm coming.  another gift basket.  "we regret to inform you "that due to the regurgitator's recent evil behavior, "you have been downgraded to a minor threat.

hole.  now, kids, are you all right.  we're fine.  hey, where's ferb.  are you okay.  oh, there you are.  and there's candace.   hey, what gives.   whoa, this doesn't look too good at all.  kids, don't come up here.  it's far too dangerous.  mom and i will fix the boat.  candace, why don't you look for some food.  and, boys, you could find us some shelter if you like.  we may be here for a while.  a while.  you mean we're stranded..  that means i won't get to jeremy's party before the sun sets.  we'll be stuck here forever, eating rocks and bugs.  then i'll have to marry a monkey and have monkey kids and name them xavier and amanda.   and we'll love them anyway.  candace, the sooner we get started, the sooner we all get to go home.  fine.  lawrence: stay safe, everyone.  shelter, shelter.  well, this spot has potential.  isabella: great, let's get started.   monogram: remember, carl, nothing distracts kids like ice cream.  you need to get rid of those two boys so agent p can proceed with his mission.  ayeaye, sir.  both hands on the wheel, carl.  sorry, sir.  oh, perry. i could not find the platypus food.   oh, boy.  both: ice cream, ice cream.   oh, i almost forgot perry.  come along.  let us get you a little treat.  give me a double caramel fudge.  here you go.  buford: ugh. hey, this is butterscotch ripple.  is this your first day on the job or something.  hey, he didn't charge me.  rookie mistake.  i did not even get towait, where is perry.  glad to have you back, agent p.  you lost some time, but i brought along the escape cone.  agent p, we've just received reports that doofenshmirtz has been buying up all the laundry detergent in the tristate area.  we want you to find out what he's up to and put a stop to it.  you'll need to use your tracking device to find him before your delicious ice cream cone melts.    candace, go find us some food.   like a quart of ice cream is just gonna fall out of the doofenshmirtz: where is perry the platypus.  he should have been here hours ago.  ah, perry the platypus.  well, you know, i had a trap for you, but no time.  this one's a little complicated, okay.  you remember a few schemes ago when i couldn't figure out what "big laundry" meant.  well, this.  this is what i meant.  i am nefariously planning to provide the entire population of the tristate area with free laundry, which will drive out of business all of the local laundromats, freeing up prime real estate locations for my newest franchise: the doofenshmirtz institute of evilology, where in only six weeks students can earn a certificate in mayhem, larceny or ponzi schemes.  and i'm here in this volcano on this deserted island 'cause i get all this free monkey labor.  i control them all with my monkeyenslavenator helmet.  and all i had to do was build one of them, because, you know, monkey see monkey do. hey, hey.  yeah, you can't put the red clothes in with the white wash.  you'll turn the whole batch into a big pink mess.  bright colors over there, you incompetent baboon.  literally.  okay, now what was i talking about.  baljeet: perry.  where are you.  oh, it is no use.  i fear he is gone for good.  why don't you just buy 'em a new one.  they won't know the difference.  you cannot just buy await. that gives me an idea.  we don't need to eat.  we need to get out of here.  i swear, if i don't get to jeremy's partyyuck.  monkey cooties.   so, what do you think of our shelter.  can't you just be normal for one day..  all you had to do was make a little leanto for survival.  well, there's survival and then there's living.  let us give you a quick tour.  we've got everything we need to make our maritime mishap as enjoyable as possible.  here's our warm and cozy family room.  a fullystocked kitchen.  we even have indoor plumbing.  candace: you're giving a monkey a shower.  yep. it had to be done.  grr. don't you realize i have a very important party to go to.  if you're going to all this trouble, you could have built us a bridge back to town.  but dad didn't ask us to build a bridge.  or you could have built us a coconutpowered hovercraft.  but dad didn't ask us to buildoror you could have made a gigantic slingshot and shot us back to the mainland.  hey, not bad.  mind if we use that some day.  ooh, you two are gonna be so busted.  oh, wait.  no, candace.  not that way. that's the emergency exit.  i was trying to tell you, it's not done yet.  there's gonna be this whole slide thing that dumps you into the hot tub.  we're waiting on some parts.  doofenshmirtz: no, no, perry the platypus.  you put that down rightow.  ow, that smarts.    phineas: so do you want a banana smoothie.  i got you guys this time.  there's no way you could dismantle your stupid tropical dream house before i drag mom back here to bust you.  phineas: so no smoothie then.   ow. ow.   that's right, run away, perry the plaargh.  nice try, perry the platwait, wait, what are you doing.  don't throw the bright colors in with thetoo much soap.  curse you, perry the plai told you no starch.     volcano.  we need to move now.  wait until mom and dad find out.  phineas: run, candace.  pink lava behind you.  pink lava.   well, that's it.  great job fixing the ship, honey.  but how are we going to get it back in the water.  oh, yes, well, um...  candace: mom, dad, we gotta get outta here.  whoo.  hurry up, kids.  women and children first.  kids, we're headed home.  you were magnificent, captain.  candace: can't we go any faster.  come on, steer this thing.  go, go, go, go, go.  oh, buford.  perhaps this will buy us a little time.  frozen waffle, please.  ugh.  sorry, got hungry.  ugh. maybe they will not know the difference.  buford: i think it's pretty convincing.  oh, who am i kidding.  we will have tell them the truth.  you're on your own, jeet.  i'm outta here.   phineas: baljeet, we're home.  hold on, jeremy, i'm coming.  oh, my friends.   i hope you can forgive me.  hey, baljeet, wait till you hear what we did today.  but i have something to tell you first.  what is it.  it is oh, there you are, perry.  aw, and look at that.  baljeet made perry a little friend.  thanks, baljeet.  i knew
