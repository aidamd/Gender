 but look at my tongue.  see. ah. look at that.  my doctor said no more raspberry iciclepops until the blue dye flushes completely out of system.  why must i be alone.  i don't know.  why are raspberry icicle pops blue.  and i know what you are doing, norm.  you're a sick, sick robot.  i need a really evil scheme.  but, oh, it's so hard to create when i'm in one of my moods.  maybe i can borrow someone else's plans from the internet.  "blueprints" and search.  ooh, an antigravity fun launcher.  how about the antigravity evil launchinator.  there. i changed the name, that makes it mine.  this could be the greatest scheme ever.  although i'm not quite sure of the evil applications.  ah, something will come to me.  ah. doofenshmirtz just downloaded a blueprint.  "antigravity fun launcher".  sounds fishy. let's run it through the anagram decoder.  ah. major monogram.  you don't have to yell.  i'm right here.  doofenshmirtz just downloaded these plans for an antigravity fun launcher.  but when i run that through the anagram decoder, the letters form "evil fanatic hunter raygun." looks like you're missing an e.  they're probably jt trying to mislead us.  let's check the source.  agent p's owners.  they must be in league with doofenshmirtz.  i don't know, carl.  sounds a little farfetched.  but wait, listen to this.  it's a seemingly innocent voice recording of phineas.  ferb, i know what we're gonna do today.  but if we play all those syllables backwards in a random order we get...  let's help doofenshmirtz destroy the tristate area.  keep a close eye on those boys.  see what else you can find out.  . perry .  agent p, we need you to track down a missing agent.  code name: agent g.  we're not sure of his current location, but we have a few leads placing him in iceland, monte carlo, burbank, california, and the moon. it's up to you to chase that goose and bring him back to the agency.  good luck, agent p.  monogram out.  so who is agent g again.  gary the gander. oh, that's just a wildgoose chase.  get it.  goose, gander. heh.  uh, we had to distract agent p because he's too close to phineas and ferb.  then who will investigate the boys.  hm, we need to send someone in undercover.  all the agents are out on their missions.     . carl dressed as a cheerleader .  . carl, now he's wearing a pinafore .  . carl in his pajamas .  . carl, now he's a guy from the civil war .  . dressed as a cowboy or an old steelworker .  . and now he's the lead in a '40s tearjerker .  . he's carl incognito .  good luck, agent carl.  you can count on me, sir.  okay, now where's perry.   all right, guys, chopchop.  time to prove sir isaac newton wrong.  sir, i've reached the target.  over.  monogram : roger that, carl.  now observe, then infiltrate.  who's that, phineas.  oh, hey, kid.  you wanna help.  me. sure.  sir, i've made contact.  hey, thanks.  what's your name.  uh...  carl: say a cool name like nitro, dax or steel.  my name is carl.   nice to meet you, carl.  come and join us in the fun.  sir, i've gained their trust.  so, what kind of scheme is this.  we're just having fun challenging universal laws.  so i hear you're the math genius behind this operation.  oh, no, no, no.  phineas and ferb's blueprint was already brilliant.  i just made a minor modification.  interesting.  so ferb, you don't talk much, do you.  actually, ioh, what's that over there.  nice job, everyone.  it came out perfectly.  who wants to go first.  i think our guest should go first.  ah, uh, me.   okay, ferb, let's see what we can do about that pesky gravitational pull.  ah. what's happening.  don't worry.  it only lasts 15 minutes.  looks fun though, doesn't it.  let's all go.    coming through.  so, what exactly is the evil purpose in all of this.  evil.  this is just for fun.  hey, guys, wait for me.   . gravity's not so much a law .  . as just a mere suggestion .  . whether or not you gonna follow it .  . is up to your discretion .  . so if you wanna get above the trees .  . get ready for some zero g's .  . get in line 'cause you know .  . that there's no way .  . when you levitate .  . when you levitate .  . when you levitate .  . i said when you levitate .  . when you levitate .  . when you levitate .  . when you levitate .  . oh .  . when you levitate .  phineas and ferb floating in midair.  ooh, they are so busted this time.  i've gotta find mom.   monogram: carl, status update. over.  sir, i can't whoa. ah.  carl. carl.  oh, no, they must be torturing that poor kid.  don't worry, little unpaid intern, help is on the way.  thanks for bringing this down for me, norm.  for some reason, it runs on solar power.   how many times do i have to tell you.  you can't park in a loading zone.  well, uh, it's not a vehicle.  it's an evil device.  you see, this is what i do for a living.  no, don't. oh.    gary the gander.  i know nothing.    that was so much fun.  remember when isabella.  ahem.  who's that.  uh, hello, son.  all: hi, carl's dad.  hello, children.  carl, uh, your mother and i were worried when you didn't come home.  uh, are you in trouble.  no, majer, dad.  i was just playing with my new friends.  sir, situation neutralized.  abort mission.  : i repeat, abort mission.  well, uh, ahem, son, it's time to go homeaw, come on, dad, can't i just stay for five more minutes.  no, no, we have to go.  your, uh, mom is making dinner.  see you later, carl.  it was a lot of fun.  nice kid.  last one in has to clean up.   doofenshmirtz: stop.   hm, that's an interesting shape.  it looks familaah.   wait. an antigravity evil launchinator.  i've found another one.  heh. what are the odds.  norm, get down here.  i need help.  our next guest is a covert secret agent.  we've pixilated his face to conceal his identity.  now, i understand that you're searching for a longlost colleague.  oh, you brought a picture.  now, viewers, if you see this agent, call in immediately.   well, i guess he found him.  hey, buddy, you forgot your pixilation.  norm, you're spectacular.  i never knew you could do that.  did you know i could also do this.  really. wow. i should really read your instruction book.  yes.  yes, you should.  candace: it's about 30 feet tall with electrodes and stuff.  mom: mmhm.  candace: you'll see.  i'll just open the gate, and you'lleek. it's gone.  mom: that's a shocker.   norm, you've really outdone yourself today.  does this mean.  yes, you'll have your iciclepop stick bride.  yay.   doofenshmirtz: uhoh.  you got a license to drive a robot with more than two axles.  uh, um, uh...  that's what i thought.  okay, charley, pull her up.  doofenshmirtz: curse you, motor vehicle code.  i'm very proud of you, carl.  but my feelings for you can be better expressed in your evaluation.  carl: all gold stars.   oh, there you are, agent p.  sorry about the wildgoose chase.  you were just too close to this case.  but don't feel bad. no one could ever find agent g.  he's been missing for far, far too long.  what the. agent g.  on an extremely extended vacation, hm.  well, agent p deserves a vacation more than you do.  he deserves one, but unfortunately, evil never rests.  so we'll see you tomorrow.  well, this is getting a little awkward.  carl, my arm's getting tired and he won't salute back.  ah, here's the doohickey that fuses with your spinal cord.  hey, guys.  what you doing.  today we're gonna fuse our nervous systems with dad's laptop and surf the web using only our cerebral cortexes.  wow. surely that would be quite an exciting project.  oh, hey, baljeet. why are you dressed like a vegetable samosa.  because today is the tristate area unification day.  i learned all about it in assimilation class.  you see, the tristate area was the bistate area until our founder, the great john p. tristate, uttered the immortal words: the, uh, bistate area should be united with that adjacent area right over there.  but we knew that.  i was just wondering why you were dressed up like a vegetable samosa.  oh, that. my uncle kamal is doing an exotic cuisine float in the parade, and i'm the...  both: vegetable samosa.  hey.  buford.  i thought i was supposed to be the vegetable samosa why can we not both be vegetable samosas.  oh, sure, two vegetable samosas.  why don't we all just dress like vegetable samosas.  in fact, why don't we just all dress like mashed potatoes and take the word exotic right off the sign.  buford, wait.  no, man, it's over. i'm gonna go find another nerd.  but what about the tristate area unification day parade.  what. is that what this parade is for.  does no one know what today is.  well, excuse me, but that adjacent area was founded by my great uncle otto h. adjacent.  he didn't wanna be no part of no tristate unification, and neither do i.  the blood of otto h. adjacent runs through these veins, and blood is thicker than water.  well, mango chutney is thicker than blood.  buford: you're dead to me.  parade. i love parades.  ferb, i know what we're gonna do today instead.  we're gonnahey, where's perry.  monogram: ah, there you are, agent p.  well, let's get down to brass tacks.  what's this.  happy passiveaggressive relationship day.  oh, was that today.  carl:that's okay.  you probably weren't gonna get me anything anyway.  well, i completely forgot.  carl: no, no. you know, i didn't even want a present.  anyway, where were we.  for some reason, doofenshmirtz has purchased a tow truck, which isn't evil in itself, but he may be planning on towing something evil, so check it out.  . perry .  candace, are you ready for our girl's day out.  just a sec, mom.  ahha. wait a minute.  are you guys just out here arranging kiddie wagons.  at the moment.  hm.  carry on.  all clear. luckily, the boys aren't up to anything.  a little to the left.  there you go.  candace, you have to promise me that you won't obsess about phineas and ferb.  yeah, sure, mom.  i promise.  don't just promise this time.  raise your right hand.  do you, candace gertrude flynn, solemnly swear not to obsess about your brothers, or you'll suffer the pharaoh's curse.  the pharaoh's curse.  yes or no.  okay, yes.  okay, now we can have fun.  . doofenshmirtz evil incorporated .  perry the platypus.   you like that.  i call it my indoorsinator.  i got the idea from the perryshaped hole you left in my wall and in my bathroom door andand in my fridge.  man, you were hungry that day.  anyway, here's my evil plan.  tada.  i'm calling it the duplic8inator.  get it. duplic, then the number eight, then inator.  i bet you're wondering what it does, huh.  here, i'll show you.  i can't believe you started a monkey basketball team and you've only got one monkey.  oh, great, now three of them are gonna have to sit on the bench.  see, it duplicates everything eight times.  when i zap those streets there will be eight times the traffic.  and danville will come to a standstill.  that's where i will make out like a bandit.  see, i bought this tow truck off the internet.  i'm going to call it the towinator or something, and open a service, and then i'll go andof course, it will be hard for me to drive...  anywhere, with all that trafficbut, you know, that's a bridge i'll cross when i get there.   i've never been bullied into stopping a parade before.  what should i do.  i don't know if this is working out.  can you talk in an indian accent.  indian accent. no. i can do an english accent instead.  : hello, guv. top of the morning.  toodlepip.  last night, mr. guffman, my toilet was broken in two.   actually, that was pretty good.  okay, everyone, let's show everybody what tristate unification is all about.  cue love handle.  . the tristate area was the bistate area .  . with an adjacent area right over there .  . they put it all together now there's no use denying .  . this parade is all about our area unifying .  . there's only one thing we care about .  . we want you all to stand up and scream and shout .  . it's the tristate area unification day .  . it's the tristate area unification day .  . it's the tristate area unification day .  . it's the tristate area unification day .  ferb, water hazard ahead.  commence operation: unforeseen circumstance.  . it's the tristate area unification day .  . it's the tristate area unification day .  . it's the tristate area unification day .  . it's the tristate area unification day .  oh, nuggets.  : that's too bad.  maybe you should dress like a policeman and reroute the parade.  if that wasn't such a good idea, i'd flatten you.  mama mia. that was close.  mom: see, candace.  isn't this nice to just get away and enjoy a day together.  you're right, mom.  this is the best.  i'm not even going to think abouthm, you know.  i'm not even gonna say their names.  that's the spirit.  i'm just gonna sit here and enjoyooh.  the parade coming by. ha.  look at that kid in the cute little carah.  mom. ah. what am i doing.  i am blocking my view.  what my brothers do doesn't effect me.  letting it go for just one day.   nails. happy, relaxing, fun.  you say something, honey.   now they're headed for the junkyard, from whose gravitational pull it'll be impossible to escape.  am i thinking of a junkyard, or something else.   ferb, treacherous terrain coming up.  execute operation: thing in our way.    otto h. adjacent will be avenged.  now which button was it.  because one of these buttons make it fire willynilly all over the place, and i don't want to hit that one by mistake.  oh, someone's at the door.  i'll be right there.  oh, excuse me perry the platypus. what can i.  ah.  oh, see there, thatthat's the willynilly button.   mom, this place is so fancy schmancy.  i just hope it isn't too noisy with that silly parade going on outside.  believe me, i'm trying to tune it out.  so, what looks good to you.  remember the pharaoh's curse.  wait. it doesn't count if she sees them herself.  hey, mom.  i bet you can't turn your head 180 degrees like an owl.  no, just 90.  hey, can you show me that twisty yoga move you do again.  maybe after lunch, dear.  i'm curious what the back of your chair looks like.  can you turn around and show me.  okay, candace, what's up.  mom, why can't you just turn around.  okay, you want me to turn around. i'm turning around.  can we just eat lunch now.  fine.  buford: if that parade makes it to the end, my hopes for the adjacent area secession are through.  i gotta stop it.  : what is your next plan.  i know it is going to be something clever.  that's it.  the other accents were amusing, but that one's just offensive.  : wait. what about me.  buford: i'm firing you as my nerd.  das is nicht gut.   isabella: that's weird that our floats are floating away.  yeah. well, they are called floats.  what the. ah.     a platypus balloon.  a perry the platypus balloon.  candace, i'm having a great time with you today.  see how relaxing it is when you're not obsessing about your brothers.  i can't take it anymore.  mom, i really tried my best to give you a day, but it's the boys.  the boys.  they're in the parade.  with giant floats.  so come on, you gotta bust them.  wow.  it's all just one big place.  no bistate area.  no adjacent area.  it's all just one, big tristate area.  right over there.  uhoh. mama.  you know, this balloon is actuah.  curse you, perry the platypus balloon.   oh, no.  buford is in trouble.  i must do something.  please, my bully is in trouble.  let go of all of your balloons.  yeah, okay.  thank you.  no, thank you, vegetable samosa.   man: uh, did you guys see that.  let's investigate.  what we really need is a grand finale so spectacular that people will always remember tristate area unification day.  hey, what's that.  happy tristate unification day.  ooh, yeah.  man: yeah, just some unification day parade stunt.  that'll do it.  hey, buford, great finale.  yeah, it was really, really nice.  nice. aw, now i gotta go do something to balance out the universe.  see you on the news.  baljeet: wait, wait, no, buford.  no, no, no, please don't.  i was going to eat those jelly doughnuts.  missed you, baljeet.  right back at you, buddy.  and thus the universe is balanced.  candacebehold.  phineas and ferb have taken over the parade.  hi, mom.  hi, mrs.
