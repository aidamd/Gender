patchacquiring opportunities in the shortest period of time.  then, after you wrestle the crocodiles, you'll corkscrew through the overpass and free fall past the flaming high wire to make your last delivery and receive the 50th patch.  got it.  is all that really necessary.  we're going to need you to plant one of these fireside girl markers at the site of each task so the girls at the lodge can

going down.    come on, candace.  you can do it.  pin him, already.  we're running behind.   this is really putting us off schedule.  so let me explain my new evil scheme.  a while back, my doctor put me on a lowcarb diet, but i still can't lose those last 10 pounds.  every time i get close to my goal, there's this knocking at the door.    who is it.  fireside girls.  would you like to buy some of our cupcakes.  cupcakes, you say.  i really shouldn't. i should get o e i'm almost down to my goal.  oh, we understand.  have a niceall right, you talked me into it.  thanks.  so with my weakness for highcarb sweets, there's really no other choice but to get rid of the bridge to the fireside cupcake factory.  and my metaldestructinator can turn any metal object into broccoli.  i know what you're thinking: why broccoli.  but, well, you know, it's healthy.  it's like the opposite of what i'm trying to getit'sit's poetic justice.  it'swell, it's notnot justice, exactly...  poetic evil.  it's poetically evil.  now, to make some lastminute adjustments...   wrestlinganalligatorinasewer patch: check.   so, what's next.  we're a bit behind.  you can finish out the rest while you work on your

uh, good luck with that.  no, i can do this.  now, that's persistence.   i see the building.  and i still got three minutes.  got it, 38th floor.  out of order.  okay, stairs. step aerobics, don't fail me now.  doofenshmirtz: come back here.  oh, what are you doing down there.  uhoh.     curse you, perry the coming.  fireside girl.  here's your order of cupcakes.  aren't you a little old to be a fireside girl.  yes, yes, i am.  isabella: candace, we are all very impressed.  you earned more patches in one day than anyone in the history of the fireside girls.  fortynine patches.  which pretty much blows away the previous record ofix patches held by our own addison sweetwater.  aw, nuts.  no, i know i did all 50.  and i made sure to plant the markers and everything.  huh. looks like i forgot one.  i'll just run back before it's 5:00.   i'm sorry, candace.  you know, you may not have lit up the entire board, but you did demonstrate remarkable persistence.  you mean i get a persistence patch.  and that makes 50, right.  there's no persistence patch, is there.  nope, afraid not.  hold on, isabella.  little miss sassy mouth here gets a special patch for breaking the alltime record.  congratulations, fireside girl.  and here's your ticket for the paisley sideburn brothers concert.  let's go.   whoo. yeah.  phineas and ferb.  how did you guys get in.  isabella invited us.  she's allowed to bring guests, you know.  that's what i kept trying to tell you, candace, but you were so insistent on becoming a fireside girl.  maybe you can start working on your goodlistener patch next.   )
