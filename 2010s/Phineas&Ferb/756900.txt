 . there's a hundred and four days of summer vacation . and school comes along just to end it . so the annual problem for our generation . is finding a good way to spend it . like maybe . building a rocket, or fighting a mummy . or climbing up the eiffel tower . discovering something that doesn't exist hey.  . or giving a monkey a shower . surfing tidal waves . creating nanobots or locating frankenstein's brain it's over here.  . finding a dodo bird painting a continent . or driving our sister insane phineas.  . as you can see, there's a whole lot of stuff to do . before school starts this fall come on, perry.  . so stick with us, 'cause phineas and ferb are gonna do it all.  . so stick with us, 'cause phineas and ferb are gonna do it all. .  mom, phineas and ferbare making a title sequence.  doofenshmirtz:sy.  so then jeremy said...   stacy.  phineas and ferb,that was important.  you guys are sogonna get it. mom.  narrator: elsewhere in space...  i think the boys are shooting green lasers in the backyard.  look. hey, ferb.  i can totally see up your nose.  hey, kids. how's the overnighter going.  great, mom. everyone's helping, even perry.  candace, do you remember two weeks ago when we wrote up this contract. the bust accord.  and do yourecall article 12.  yes. "i will not attempt to bust my brothers more than once a day." i remember. but...  and what happened earlier today.  i tried to show you a giant ant farm.  excellent, we have an understanding.  now go to bed. you can try again tomorrow.  fine, i'll just wait till tomorrow.  wait a minute, at midnight, it'll be tomorrow.  i can just stay up and bust them.  this sleepover is a good idea.  how are we all supposed to see through that puny telescope.  the telescope is just to find the probe we launched 17 months ago.  then we can tap into the signal from deep space.  and using dad's old projection screen and some fiber optics to relay the images from the probe, we can view the galaxy in comfort from these lawn chairs.  space probe. fiber optics.  ooh, i can smell a bust coming tonight.  these joysticks should control the space probe remotely.  come on, already. let's start looking for stuff.  buford, i've never seen you so enthusiastic.  i have my reasons.  oh, here we go again.  he's going to tell the story of when he was abducted by aliens.  it wasn't an abduction. it was an encounter.  encounter.  yeah, i was walking out in the woods one night with my lucky tambourine.  buford: . float by drift through my dreams . whalemingo . whalemingo . in the sky like strawberry cream . whalemingo . whalemingo . you take a whale you drop the fla . keep the mio that's how i named it whalemingo . whalemingo . if you see a big pink whale . with feathers and a beak and skinny little legs then bingo . that's a whalemingo . whalemingo . whalemingo . whalemingo buford: i think about you often, whalemingo.  . whalemingo . whalemingo . whalemingo .  buford: that's my story.  i didn't know you had a lucky tambourine.  this whole story is ridiculous.  no, it's not. i have proof.  oh, here comes the picture.  see. i named him tristan.  that is just a flamingo.  tristan is not a flamingo.  he's from outer space, and he's a whalemingo.  but then he had to go home, and i never saw him again.  hey. what are you doing with your hands.   mocking you.  all right. i'd be angry, but i admire your honesty.   monogram: there you are, agent p.  sorry to call you in for a second time today, but...  oh, this. it's... it's just an exfoliating mask.  i have another 10 minutes before i can peel it off, or i get zero of the benefits.  agent p, we just got word that doof may have fired tomorrow's inator today.  this is a major breach in protocol.  so give yourself a good slap in the face and get over there.  chorus: . perry .  okay, gang, let's fire this thing up.   zoom in on the swirly thing.  my gut tells me that's where the whalemingos are.  roger that.  phineas: hey, it's our milk shake bar.  and business seems to be booming.  what about over to the left.  phineas: okay.  wow.  yeah, wow.  it's a whole planet of...  whalemingos.  baljeet: i do not believe it. buford was right.  isabella: they're all so beautiful.   tristan.    . one dutch, two dutch queens of the double dutch . we skip better than you by that much . watch our feet our moves are sweet . our double dutching... .   perry the platypus.  how did you get stuck in my double dutch machine.  that's not even a trap.  anyway, what are you doing here.  oh, that, the beam that i shot through my roof.  well, that was just an accidental misfire from my sphereattractinator.  luckily, it was pointed up, so it didn't hit anything.  anyway, i started thinking and realized the true measure of a man is having a worldfamous roadside attraction.  but which one to choose.  which one would be the most spectacular.  then it hit me. nothing brings them in like a big ball of twine.  so that's why i built the sphereattractinator, to steal the world's largest ball of twine.  then all i need is some sort of road to put it beside. right.  i gotta admit, buford, i had my doubts.  but whalemingos are truly amazing.  told you.  hey, why is everything all fuzzy.  i'm not sure. let me back it up and we'll take a look.  it looks like the planet's growing. planets do that, right.  it is not growing. it is getting closer.  this sounds serious.  oh. this is catastrophic.  should we not do something.  should no one inform the populous of the impending impact.  calm down, baljeet.  i'm sure the government scientists are already doing something.    duck and cover.  my watermelon.  based on my calculations, the planet will be here by midnight.  that's great news.  our planets are going to collide.  you do know what that means.  sure. it's like when you have two sets of keys, and you keep one in the car.  no, it means...   no.  it means all life is going to be wiped out on both planets.   guys. we gotta save tristan.  anything else, buford.  and the earth.  well, perry the platypus, what do you say we open up the roof and activate the sphereattractinator.  then i can get a good night's rest before all the crowds arrive to see the world's biggest ball of...    . one dutch, two dutch queens of the double dutch . we skip better than you by that much . watch our feet our moves are sweet . our double dutching won't be beat . croucher, springer . croucher... .  what are we gonna do.  we could use electromagnets, if only we knew the planet's molecular density.  i got a pail of water, and a nest to make tristan comfortable.  i figure i can keep him in my garage till spring.  spring. spring. that's it.  guys, i know what we're gonna do tonight.  . one dutch, two dutch queens of the double dutch . we... . oh, you're sassy.  i knew they would practically bust themselves if i just waited long enough.  you guys are so busted in, like, nine minutes.  oh, hey, candace. glad you're still up.  you'll get to see the cool planet coming directly at us.  but don't worry, we're building a giant spring to bounce it back into space where it came from.  a spring. that's not very scientific.  but it is still bustable.  here comes the planet now.  i can't wait till they get here.  tristan.  finally, it's tomorrow.  mom. mom.  what are you guys doing.  oh, hi, honey. we were just listening to some records.  it's what we used to use for music when we were kids.  candace, i thought we had an understanding.  yeah. it's midnight. tomorrow.  don't worry. it will be all right.  the world's largest ball of twine is on its way.  uh, you better stand back.  it's supposed to be huge. it's supposed to...  what. that's it.  goodbye, tristan.   remember me.  i got a twine ball bigger than this in my junk drawer.   help me, perry the platypus.  i'm slipping.  oh, thank you, perry the...   i mean, curse you, perry the platypus.  . one dutch, two dutch queens of the double dutch . we skip better than you by... .  hurry. let's go, let's go.  clearly, we need a thirteenth amendment to the bust accord.  mom.  you kids okay out here.  yeah, we're great.  we saw a giant planet filled with whalemingos.  whalemingos, huh. why don't you all come on in for a midnight snack.  wash your hands. especially you, buford.  hey, sleepyhead, do you want a snack, too.   phineas: ferb,gonna do today.re a quilt. no way.  i mean, i knowit's been a long summer, and you guys areand i...out of ideas, that's okay, buford.with us every day.hang no, no. i'm in. i'm in.i don't wanna play alone.  i'll turninto a cat kid.  what's a cat kid.  it's the kid versionof a cat lady.  quick, somebody say,"where's perry." where's perry.  you're always there for me.  chorus: . doofenshmirtz evil incorporated.  .  oh, it's you.   yeah, sorry, no time for a trap.  it's nothing personal.  you see, today is the annual love muffin summer stock festival, and i got the title role.  so i have to take over the tristate area by 3:30 if i want to make curtain.  uh, that doesn't leave me much time for, you know, the trapping and the fighting.  so, instead, i built this, the triptothedesertinator.  it's going to send you to the desert, and i can get on with my day.  and don't bother running, 'cause i've installed a perrytrackinator.  it's going to follow you no matter where you...  oh, great. now i'm in the middle of nowhere.  now i'll never be able to take over the tristate area before...  the play.  wait, wait. don't leave me here.  uh, perry the platypus, please. it's important to me.  and if this works out, i might give up evil for acting.  won't you give me that chance.  to succeed at something that might very well turn my life away from the evil path.  do it for the kids. do it for the orphans...  ...that i might perform in front of someday if i ever do a show in an orphanage.  i don't want to be ungrateful or anything, but is there any way to speed this up.  i gotta be in the makeup chair at 4:00.  hey, what aboutthis turbo switch.  that ought tohuh, right. yeah...,  some pilot you are.  oh, sure, blame the victim.  like you didn't know about my switchflipping compulsion.  oh, now you're mad. sure.  i don't know why i tried to be nice.  i should have just trapped you.  i could have been out of the hospital and on my way to the theater by now.  instead, they'll end up using my understudy.  oh, i hate that guy.  so, if doofenshmirtz is late, i get to go on.  if he's not back in time for his entrance, you can have the part.   i guess it is summer and we're in the desert, but i feel like it's unseasonably warm out here.  i feel warm. do you feel warm.  why do we always see cow skulls in the desert.  and why do you only see the skull.  did the body die somewhere else. it makes no sense.  oh, i'm sorry, am i talking too much for you.  fine, i'll be quiet. i can shut up.  i don't have to talk all the time.  it's not like i have to fill the space.  if you want silence, i'll give you silence.  you watch.  and it's gonna be deafening.  mark my words.  why do they say, "mark my words".  i mean, they just mean, "listen to my words." why don't they just say, "listen to my words".  . nowhere to go nothing to see . except sand, and sand and sand, and you and me hey, look how big the sun is through this magnifying glass.  ow. ow. oh.  no, really, it's huge. you should see it.  . baked from the heat we've got sun on all sides . gettin' tanned, and tanned like we're a couple of hides i mean, he drives a taxi for heaven's sake.  he could work anywhere.  but he expects her to just pack up and move to vegas.  i mean, seriously.  . two lost nomads who will never be missed . some might interpret this as just a karmic slap on the wrist . but i've just gotta say it's a heck of a day to be us i was d grow back, but it never did.  see. pure titanium. it's a fact.  . it's a heck of a day to not have a car . and just walk, and walk and not know where you are you don't communicate, you know that.  you don't share. i know nothing about your private life.  you're very closed off. closed, that's you.  . we got no kind of a map nothing to show us the way . and it's just talk and talk, and talk with nothin' to say . it's a heck of a day a heck of a day to be us . it's a heck of a day to be us .  so i never touched an iguana again.  actually, that's not entirely true.  there was one time back in...  ooh, ooh, ooh. look, perry the platypus, look.  yeah, yeah, you see up there. two tires and an axle.  ah, pretty soon we'll be rolling out of here.  we just gotta hop this fence.  what do you mean, "no".   oh, oh, you gotta be kidding.  you know what, perry the platypus.  i just had my third realization of the day.  i had two earlier, but i didn't share them with you.  i've realized that the thing that's kept me from succeeding all these years, isn't my parents t showing up for my birth.  it isn't my eight month stint as an organgrinder monkey.  it isn't the time i got my arm stuck under that boulder.  also titanium now. see.  it isn't any of those things. you know what it is.  it's you.  you are what's been holding me back all these years.  oh, very clever.  take my accusing finger and point it back at me.  so you think i'm responsible for my failures.  well, you're wrong. i can prove it.  if you would just let me try my junkyard scheme without interfering, it will prove to you that you are the source of all my failures.   uh, a little boost here, perry the platypus.  uh, no, you're right, you're right.  by myself. hmm, okay, all i have to do is...      okay, okay, okay. uh, just this once, i failed and you had nothing to do with it.  but did you have to let me trip all three bear traps.  i mean, come on. i'm out here in the hot sun working on ways to get us back to danville, and you've never even offered me so much as a glass of water, or a tetanus shot.  i'm going it alone. as a matter of fact, i'm sick of you and your smug face.  i don't wanna see it anymore.  i'm going to close my eyes and count to three, and when i'm done, you'd better be gone.  and it will be just like when you're here, except you won't be here.  one, two, three.  hey, he really...  fine, then. i can find the bus station on my own.   i said i wanted a sea otter for christmas.  they said i had to pick my present from the bottom shelf of the kitchen caustics aisle of the supermarket.  so i picked the oven cleaner.  i loved that oven cleaner.  oven cleaner.  hey. a bus station.  danville and points east.   ticket, please.  i don't have a ticket.  but i've got to get to danville to be in a play.  i've just gotta. i don't have any money.  i'm tired and dirty. it's all my fault. i've...  it's always been my fault.  i'm a failure. i'm a failure.   i'm a failure.  so, no ticket.  i'm a failure.  two bus tickets.  oh, perry the platypus. you're a mensch.  i know i can be testy and unpleasant, and i know i tend to ramble on and on.  to be fair, the burden of conversation is kind of all on me in our relationship.  and i know that i haven't always given you the respect you deserve.  anyway, i want you to know that you are appreciated, perry the platypus.  you are appreciated.  oh, hey, now, check it out. look, see. a tear.  the universal secretion for sincerity.  i'll just save that for next time.  come on, you can have a window seat.  hold it. no animals allowed.  tough break. thanks for the ticket, though.  doofenshmirtz: sweet. it's airconditioned in here.  it's not like i wanted to go to the desert.  he just jetpacked into me and dragged me along.  no animals on the bus. it's not my rule.  it's company policy.  it's not my fault.  are you talking to me.  and what does he expect. he's my nemesis.  i'm a stonecold villain. i'm ruthless.  i have no ruths.  still, he, uh, he looked so sad and pathetic when the bus pulled away.  i should think of something else.  uh... kreplach. kreplach, uh, eastern european comfort food. you like kreplach.  as a matter of fact, i do.  when i was a little girl, my grandmother and i would make kreplach.  first we would roll out the...  enough of your blabbering on and on.  my little nemesis is out there all alone.  i can't believe it.  stop the bus. stop the bus. stop.  man 1: hey, what gives.  doofenshmirtz: i can't believe it.   enjoying the shade, perry the platypus.  it's your jetpack. i found it stuck in the mouth of a fiberglass dinosaur.  i mean, how often does that happen when you really need it.  climb aboard. come on, come on.  . doofy, doofy, doofy doofy, doofy, doofy . doofenshmirtz. .  man: one minute to curtain.  looks like doofy's a noshow.  perry the platypus, we're running out of time. we're not gonna make it.  are you trapping me.  but we were getting along so...  the turbo switch.are you kidding.  i can't control this thing at that speed.  oh, okay, perry the platypus. if you think so.   oh, well, doofenshmirtz, the show must go on without you.  and there's my cue.  i shall never go hungry again.  pizza...  pizza delivery.  what an entrance.   we got him good.  and i couldn't have done it without you.  aw. why, perry the platypus.  see. i knew i'd need it later.  that was amazing. i never thought quilting could be so much fun.  think of the possibilities.  needlepoint. embroidery. tapestry.  i'm heading down to the fabric store right now.  brocade. taffeta. saddle stitch.  actually, i didn't find it all that exciting.  yeah, me either.  never getting that day back.  whew. stinkeroo.  . baked from the heatwe've got sun on all sides . gettin' tanned, and
