other schematic for a microscopic zoo that rests on the head of a pin.  we sure have a lot of blueprints, models, and schematics.  hey, ferb, summer doesn't last forever, and we've got too many plans for just the 2 of us.  we either need more days of summer, or more of us.  what's this.  the blueprints for that robot we invented.  ferb. you're a genius.  we can make android versions of ourselves.  we can make phinedroids and ferbots.  hey, where's perry.    hohohold that elevator.    . dr. doofenshmirtz is up to his old tricks.  he's made 57 phone calls in the last hour.  we don't know to whom or why.  no, not to santa.  , your mission is doofenshmirtz is up to and stop him.  see, carl, that's why i don't like using the chimulator.  besides, that guy totally owes me a pony from when i was

pick up the phone.  pick up. up. pick up.  pick up. oh, why won't she pick up.  oh. hi, perry the platypus.  thank you for using the key i gave you.  it's much more civilized than crashing through my ceiling, don't you think. yes.  anyway, i don't know why you're here, but you can tell monogram i'm not, you know, "up to" anything.  anyways, all i've been doing here  we're having what i call a relationship bump.  and now, she won't pick up the phone.  and i'm tired of leaving messages.  i'mi've left, like, 57 messages, and i won't leave any more.  it starts to look a little desperate.  hmm. oh, no. that's not an evil scheme.  that's just a giant magnet.  i'm going to wave it over my girlfriend's house  because some of them were really long and rambly.  i mean, i know there's an ordinance against it, butwhat. oh, come on, perry the platypus.  oh. well, too bad for you.  too bad you don't believe in love.   dr. doofenshmirtz: too bad.  i'd love to come over to watch you get your ears pierced, stacy, but my mom went to zippy pics and left me in charge of my brothers.  here they come now, phineas and feruh, phineas.   i have to call you back.  oh, wait till mom finds out about phineas and ferb andphineas and ferb, and phineas, and ferb, and phineas, ferb, phineas, ferb,  they're my brothers, and they're robots.  they're brobots.     what is it, candace.  mom, i'm in the panic room.  phineas and ferb and phineas and ferb and robots.   elephant. that's nice, honey.  well, the pictures should be ready soon, and then i'll see the robots when i get home.   but everything

how's the ol' chamber of invisibility coming along.   wow. it works.  well done.  hey, normally, i'd be saying that to you, ferb.  it was kind of weird saying it to a ferbot.  let's see how the microscopic zoo is doing.  mind if we see how things are coming along.  hold her steady, ferb.   wow. that's amazing.  and according to this microscopic newspaper machine, the zoo is really packing them in.  well, i guess we can categorize this project as a success.  hey, that is the best tunnel to the center of the earth i've ever seen.  boy. i bet that was fun to build.  you know, ferb, even though these robots were a success and completely on model, i kind of miss working on stuffyou know, just you and me.  hey, what's this. thanks.  hovercraft lounge chair.  we were going to build that next week.  oh, no.  the phinedroids and ferbots have run out of projects, so they're designing their own.  have we learned nothing from mary shelley's "frankenstein".  they've started their own overpriced coffee franchise.  that's so nineties.  this is terrible.  we have an entirely new problem.  the coffee's making them go haywire, and that one's having trouble falling asleep.   poor little guy.  that's it.  you guys are drinking way too much coffee.  i'm shutting her down.   well, that's no good.  time to show these robots who's in charge.  uh, ferb, i think they're in charge.  . bowchickabowwow .  . that's what my baby says, mao, mao.  whoop. there it is, my new girlfriend's house.  now, i can erase all those embarrassing messages.  and then, i can start leaving new ones.

tailor would say, suit yourself.  it's the middle of july.  ho, ho, ho. i'm on a summer run.  farewell, perry the platypus.  bah, humbug.  so, this is how it ends, ferb, defeated by our own doppelgangers.  if only we had some sort of device that could stop them from i know. i'm just messing with you.  . phinedroids and ferbots .  . phinedroids and ferbots .  . phinedroids and ferbots .
