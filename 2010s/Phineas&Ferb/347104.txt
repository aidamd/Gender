  ooh, you're, like, so busted this time.   . busted, busted, busted, busted tralala, hey, hey .   huh. mom.  mom, mom, mom.  honey.  wait till you see what phineas and ferb are up to now.   see. what.  hey, mom.  hey, candace.  butbutbuti'm going to go check on my roast.   butbutbutbutbutbutbutbutbut...but...but...but...but...  you have inspired me.  i'm growing out my bangs.  butnamaste, compadres.  oh, no matter what i try, i just can't do it.  it's impossible.  the impossible is possible with a little teamwork.  that's what the fireside girls say.  teamwork.  sure.  how do you think i got this mountain moving patch.  by mindlessly repeating a flawed busting strategy.  no, through teamwork.  see that mountain over there.  it used to be over there.  with a little teamwork you can do anything.  teamwork.  teamwork.   stacy, i know what we're going to do today.  thank you for letting me choose today's activity.  no worries, baljeet.  it is nerd awareness week.  it is called spinning topslame.  of doom.  all right, i'll give it a shot.  okay, everyone, here is how you play.  you hold your top and then you spin.   so then what.  you do it again.   ah.  it is lame, isn't it.  not at all, baljeet.  it just needs a little more "mmph." i was hoping you would say that.  anybody else notice a distinct lack of egglaying mammals around here.  baljeet, would you do the honors.  boy howdy.   where's perry.  oh, there you are.  didn't, uh, see ya sitting there.  anyway, our sources tell us that doofenshmirtz is up to something and if we're going to put a stop to it, we'll need a little of that old egglaying mammalian magic.  how did.  why, that little scamp.  all right, ladies.  i've got a crew, i've got a plan, i want to bust.  questions. stacy.  do you have this jump suit in pink.  because i'm not really a tangerine kind of gal.  why is everything so difficult.   maybe if we help her bust her brothers she'll be done with all this busting stuffor good.  you're absolutely right, jenny.  hey, candace.  uhhuh.  i was just kidding about the color.  i love orange.  and i'm all about persimmon.  so, what do we do next.  you've heard of boot camp, well, ladies, welcome to bust camp.   . oh, yeah .  mom.  . you gotta bust .  . y . make sure that there's no way around it .  . you gotta bust .  . your brothers .  . and don't you stop until they're grounded .  . show your mom what they've been doing .  . the trouble they've been brewing .  . you know these two are doing how .  . you gotta bust .  . your brothers .  . you gotta bust your brothers now .  . doofenshmirtz evil incorporated .  norm, hurry up with that coffee.  i've still got that terrible morning taste in my mouth.  norm: coming right up, sir.  scalding hot, just the way youwhoopsie daisy.   ow. i know i didn't make you that smart, but you can't even walk straight.   i'll get it.  you'll be so delighted when your package arrives in sixtoeight weeks.  my new nemesis toy.  go run my bubble bath while i open it.  i wonder which one it is.  oh, not another platypus.  i was hoping for something more like manny the mongoose or something.  hey, let's see if it lays eggs.  perry the platypus.  say hello to my little friend.  my new straightjacketinator.  haha. it was tailormade just for you by my other little friend.  it may be small, but it's stronger and smarter than norm and it's so much more efficient.  eight hundred fortyseven.  eight hundred fortyeight.  listen up, team, i'll be at the front of the house tracking mom on my gps device.  jenny, you'll guard that gate.  see to it that phineas and ferb stay in the hot zone.  stacy, you make sure whatever they built stays there until mom comes home.  to achieve that goal we use the following busting jargon.  when mom comes home the cue is "the condor is in the nest." when the boys are in prime busting position, it's "the peas are in the pod." and if what they have built somehow disappears, i want you to scream, "the banana has split." got it.  good. now, in the event that any of us should be captured that's the mom signal.  ladies, it's go time.  so move it, move it, move it.  the pea is in the pod.  the condor is in the nest.  mom, mom, phineas and ferb have built outer space in our backyard.  nice drill, ladies.  i'ma lovin' teamwork.  phineas: hey, candace.  nice us's.  when did you make those.  pay no attention to them, mom.  yes, this new robot of mine is much more evil than norm.  course, it can't talk, but that can be a good thing.  and it even has a convenient blender attachment.  next i'm thinking of a platypus pure.  this new model requires so little energy to run it really makes clumsy old norm quite obsolete.  now i know i have a heart.  because it's breaking.  we're ready to go.  sure you don't want one, buford.  nah, i still say it's lame.  fair enough.  canopies down, everybody.  ready.  ah.  ready.  okay, ferb, bring out the radiant power source.  what's that.  you can't plug the tops in that will radiate energy across the yard to anything that needs it.  okay, everybody, now, the secret to a good top spin, if i can call it that phineas: ha, good one, baljeet.  this is almost as funi'm going for my bumper pat code red, busters.  the condor is on the wing.  i want feet on the ground.  it's real this time.  moving in.  rock and roll.  ah, still lame.  maybe i can liven things up a bit.   stacy: what's going on.  why are they going so fast.   ah, look at him. he'she's positively shaking with anticipation at the thought of helping me take over the tristate area.  he'shoohoohoo. ii didn't even know he could do that, whatever it is.  wow, i'm a better evil scientist than i thought.  doofenshmirtz, your pathetic schemes have all failed.  step aside and let the true master take over.  he can talkand shoot too. ow.  save me.  save me, perry the platypus.   perry the platypus, my fight is with doofenshmirtz, not you.   agent p, an unusual power wave has struck the city with potentially disastrous consequences.  forget doofenshmirtz, find the source of that power wave and dismantle it.  . perry .  prepare to meet your maker, maker.   i'm feeling such an odd mixture of pride and mortal terror.  mostly terror.  mostly terror.  the condor is in the nest.  let's go, condor.  candace, what is going on.  you'll see.  just wait.  so i'm guessing your brothers are doing something wildly dangerous.  uh...  well, i've got a few seconds to kill before my bladder bursts like a water balloon, so let's get this over with.  no, teamwork.  i mean, we've got to wait for the signal.  any second now.  come on, girls.  give me the code.  stacy: without the headsets, how can we signal candace.  jenny: i don't know.  how can she not hear this racket.  that's quite a racket back there.  are you sure you don't want me to take a look.  no way.  not until i get the signal.    help me, i'm going to be pured.  sorry, sir, no can do.  i'm bringing coffee to the new boss.  sounds delicious.  just a moment.  i don't want to me a smoothie.  here you go, sir.  just the way youwhoopsie daisy.  oh, it's lucky for me you tripped on that rug again.  there was no rug, sir.  aw, thank you, norm.  i shouldn't have been so hard on you, but how come you were not affected by that strange energy thingy.  don't you remember.  i run on squirrel power.  wow.  i should really read your operation manual.  wait for the signal.  wait for it.  this is getting a little uncomfortable.  eject, everybody.  oh. whoa.  i lied about the persimmon.  all right, candace, enough's enough.  no. is the pea in the pod.  is the pea in the pod.  what's up with the pea.  not again.  hey, kids.  so what was all the big racket back here.  we were just playing with our tops.  oh.   both: giant tops of doom.  buford: lame.  you girls are beginning to sound a lot like candace.  they were hugeand suddenlyoh, will you two give it up already.  but you said to wait until she offers pie.  ooh, good idea.  who wants pie.  me.  me.  me.  all: us.   oh, there you are, perry.   . we'll set the stage and let the records play on a saturday .  . and we can dance forever .  : .foreeeeever.  .foreeeeever.  .foreeeeever.  .we can dance forever.  . we won't sleep till three in the morning .  . this song speaks and it's singing the real thing .  . it feels like we're living a dream but tonight .  . we're gonna make this one right .  . we'll set the stage and let the records play on a saturday .  . and we can dance forever .  . we'll burn the light that makes the city sway .  . when we set the stage .  . we can dance forever .  : .foreeeeever.  .foreeeeever.  .foreeeeever.  .we can dance forever..  . oh, yeah .  mom.  . you gotta bust .  . your brothers .  . make sure that there's no way around it .  . you gotta bust .  . your brothers .  . and don't you stop until they're grounded .  . show your mom what they've been doing .  . the trouble they've been brewing .  . you know these two are doing how .  . you gotta bust .  . your brothers .  . you gotta bust your brothers now .  . there's 104 days of summer vacation .  . and school comes along just to end it .  . so the annual problem for our generation .  . is finding a good way to spend it .  . like maybe .  . building a rocket or fighting a mummy .  . or climbing up the eiffel tower .  . discovering something that doesn't exist .  hey. . or giving a monkey a shower .  . surfing tidal waves creating nano bots .  . or locating frankenstein's brain .  it's over here.  . finding a dodo bird painting a continent .  . or driving your sister insane .  phineas.  . as you can see there's a whole lot of stuff to do .  . before school starts this fall .  come on, perry.  . so stick with us 'cause phineas and ferb .  . are gonna do it all .  . so stick with us 'cause phineas and ferb .  . are gonna do it all .  mom. phineas and ferbare making a title sequence.  phineas:ferb, i think we outdid ourselves today.  the ultimate frozen yogurt machine.  we have enough frozen yogurt to last the entire summer.   phineas: huh. check that out, ferb.  hey there, little guy.  you want some frozen yogurt.  yeah, sorry, we don't have mushroom and larva flavor.    i think he likes you, ferb.  hey, guys. whatcha doin'.  cool, he disappeared. we found this lizard.  hey, i've seen one of these before.  according to the fireside girls' manual, that lizard is a north american chameleon.  then we'll name him steve.  okay... why steve.  because he looks like a steve.  huh. can't argue with logic like that.  so i'll see you after you teach your guitar lessons.  yeah, i only have two appointments today.  appointments. well,all right, dr. sixstrings.  good luck with your patients.  : dr. sixstrings.  now that's banter. ah.  aha.  i finally caught you guys.  that thing's not going anywhere.  you guys are so busted this time.  looks like he's still hungry.  don't worry, little guy. we'll come back with some food.  i think mom just stocked up the fridge.  bet perry's gonna love steve.  hey, where is perry.  morning, agent p.  doofenshmirtz has been stocking up on a lot of highend sound equipment and musical instruments.  in fact, he just outbid me on this sweet vintage solidbody mapletop guitar.  carl: ouch. you totally got sniped.  carl. anyway, we need you to find out what he's up to and put a stop to it.  good luck, agent p.  . doofenshmirtz evil incorporated .   hi, mr. doofenshmirtz.  ah, actually, it's dr. doofenshmirtz.  but, you know, whatever.  are you ready for your first lesson.  oh, yes, yes. please come in. i have a very special melody that i'd likeo learn how to perpetrate.  i mean play.  hey, dad. i'm headed out to theoh. a guitar player, huh.  yup. so, uh, do you know anything by the scraping fangs.  nah. not really into the heavy stuff.  i'm out of here.  ach. ach. it's so hard to see all these little notes.  do me a favor and flick on that light switch.  no, no, no, no, no. no, this.  this is the light switch. ugh.  i tried to make it as obvious as possible.  but what was that.  that was just my prototype gigantinator ray.  it's nnothing to be concerned about.   mom, mom, i finally caught them.  ta... duh.   maybe you should take it easy today and run some errands with me.  but, but, but...  steve's sure gonna love these mushrooms.  steve, where are you.  steve. uh...  guys. look at where you're standing.  whoa, it's a huge footprint.  a huge chameleon footprint.  do you realize what this means.  some giant chameleon took steve.  the rest of the tracks lead into the city.  we're coming to save you, steve.   doofenshmirtz: how am i doing. i rock, right.  um... hehheh.  what's so special about this freaky guitar solo.  well, it all started at the pyramids of egypt.  i traveled there to, you know, discover the hidden secrets of the pyramids of egypt.  and then it hit me.  the answer to my quest was staring me in the face.  hidden in those hieroglyphics was a seemingly random series of musical notes.  you see, the pyramids of egypt were built with the help of alien intelligence.  the egyptians learned how to play a cryptic guitar solo that would summon an alien armada to help them perform feats of mindblowing power.  that mystical melody is now in my very hands.  and once i learn to play it, i can summon the aliens to me.  and i will become overlord of the tristate area.  have you considered switching to decaf.  i'm sorry, i didn't mean to talk all through our lesson time.  hey, i'm charging by the hour, so knock yourself out.  it's just i'm used to doing all the talking with my nemesis.  he's a platypus.  hey, my friends have a pet platypus.  is he fierce, cunning, and good with a grappling hook.  jeremy: oh, no. their platypus doesn't do much.  well, let's take another shot at learning this solo.   jeremy: hey, doc, not bad.  i think you might be getting it.   hey, the tracks just stop.  what's casting this big shadow.   phineas & isabella: whoa.   ferb, what are you doing.  wait a minute.  it's just steve. wow.  how did he turn into a dinosaur.  actually, it's just a giant chameleon.  but dinosaur sounds cooler.  stupid errands.  huh.  what.    i get it.  the sound of candace's scream freaks him out.   what's wrong, candace.  mom. mom. mom. dinosaur. follow me.  : the boys are so busted thishey, where'd it go.  hi, boys. what are you doing here.  looking for steve, our dinosaur. can we keep him.  keep what. steve.  is he invisible. yes, yes, he is.  oh, cute. all right, candace, let's go home.  invisible friends. pfft.  i'm so getting to the bottom of this.  it's okay, steve. candace is gone.   steve, wait. steve.   sorry to bother you, agent p.  we just wanted to let you know we'd be temporarily unavailable.  seems there's a giant dinosaur running amok downtown and carl wants to go check it out.   jeremy: well, i think you've got it.  doofenshmirtz: ah, great. can you give me a hand moving my amplifinator out onto the porch.  your what.  it's my omnidirectional amplifinator.  it will blast my scorching guitar licks in all directions, ripping through the vacuum of space to summon the alien armada that will help me conquer the tristate area.  i don't know why i always say that loud.    this is so cool.  i'd try to recruit him but i don't think we have a hat that big.  steve. steve.  both: steve, where are you.  there's no way we can catch him.  he moves too fast. maybe we should just give up.  give up. give up.  the day may come when we'll give up on fruitless searches after a mere 11 minutes, but that day is not today.  the day may come when our favorite reptile may be lost from our memories and his enduring love of mushrooms forgotten, but that day is not today.  today we search.  we will search for him in the streets.  we will search for him in the trenches.  we will search for him in the alleys and the minimalls and the culdesacs of this fair land.  we'll search for him in the multilevel car parks and municipal recreational facilities.  and we few, we happy few, we small band of brothers, and girl from across the street, we shall not cease till he is found.   we'll help you find your friend. what does he look like.  he's a giant lizard about 40 feet tall.  oh. you could have mentioned that up front.  man: yeah, count me out. you're on your own.  steve. steve, where are you.  jeremy: you're really rocking now.  the spaceships should be here any minute.  and then, it will be time to pump up the volume.  well, that's the hour. i'm gonna pack up my gear.  i got another lesson across town.  okay, but the aliens are on their way. )
