oh, man, your sister's entered us in some big dance show and, you know, i just don't wanna let her down.  so, what's the problem.  have you seen the fancy dancing on the show.  i can fake it in the school auditorium, just not on a nationally syndicated dance show.  well, maybe ferb can teach you.   wow, that's reallybupbup.  wait for it.  there's no way i can learn that by tonight.  hm. maybe you don't have to.  ferb, i know what we're gonna do today.  what.  oh, sorry.  hey, i wonder where perry is.  ah, agent p.  it seems dr. doofenshmirtz has been buying up the entire tristate area's supply of potatoes, bacon and whole boatloads of chopped green onions.  sounds like a recipe for evil.  literally.  so, uh, get cooking, agent p.  monogram, out.  so here it is.  the ferbulistic grooveatron 9000.  how's that supposed to help me.  you put it on under your clothes, and nobody will see this electronic exoskeleton helping you with dance moves.  ferb does a fancy dancing move over here, and you do the same fancy move over there.   sweet.  . doofenshmirtz evil in.  automated voice: intruder alert.  well, well, well, look who's here.  perry the platypus, all shackled up and no place to go.  uh, i think we made too much potato salad, norm.  ii guess we'll have to give everyone a 2ton takehome container.  and i still think you should have added more green onions.  : well, next time you can do all the cooking, and i'll stand around coming up with evil plans that ultimately fail.  wow, cutting deep, man.  well, i'm off to our annual evil potluck and press conference.  i'll just leave you here to, you know, meet your doom.  look, i saw this in a movie once.  i didn't catch the eing, because, i had other things to do, but iit seemed pretty foolproof.  well, gotta run.  i can't be in two places at the same time, but of course, soon you'll be able to.  norm, let's go.  would it kill you to say please once in a while.  are you going to be like this all day.  yes.  yes, i am.  we are so going to win this thing, jeremy.  we are going to win.   dancers, your dance floor awaits.  our dancers will boogie until they get axed by the judges.  if your light goes out your time is up.  now, let the dancing begin.   ready.  all right, heinz.  where's the press.  patience, dr. blood pudding.  they'll be here.  when have i ever let you guys down.  far too often, doofenshmirtz.  far too often.  rodney, i don't remember inviting you.  i told you, i prefer you use my full name: alois everard elisabeth otto wolfgang hypatia gunter geilen gary cooper von rodenstein.  anyway, today is the day we reveal to the tristate area the existence of the league of villainous evildoers maniacally united for frightening investments in naughtiness.  you want us to be called "love muffin".  oh, good grief. it doesn't matter what we're called.  what's important is that we get our evil message out to the people of the tristate area.  and how are we going to do that with no tv cameras or no press of any kind.  they'll be here.  they'll be here.  clearly the buffet alone will bring them.  yummy, yummy, potato salad.  and we do seem to have a surplus of that.  did you expect everyone to lug home 2ton takehome bags.  no.  yes.  shut it, norm.  who's side are you on, anyway.  and the press will be here, rodney.  i don't think so, heinz.  dr. diminutive.  here, look.  all the press in town is covering this.  that's right, let's dance till we're sick, is filming here in danville.  and i've got all the live coverage, 24/7.  huh. well, if the press won't come to us, we'll go to the press.  to the dance hall.   attention, miserable citizens of danville.  uh, hello.  evil scientist speaking.  can.  can i get a camera over here.  what, nothing.  why are they so focused on these dancers.  because it's a dance contest, heinz.  clearly, they're only filming the best dancers.  hm. wait, that's it.  okay, split up and start dancing like you've never danced before.  whoever gets on camera first can deliver our message of evil.   rodney: they're terrible.  doofenshmirtz: oh, the humanity.  this looks like a job for alois everard elisabethoh, can it, rodney.  i think we both know that i'm a better evil dancer than you.  see this. it's my hand.  you can talk to it.  all right. hey, haha.  . my evil dancing's better than yours .  . it's like you're stuck in a canoe .  . but you got no oars .  see you on the dance floor.  nobody talks to my hand that way.   agent p., you must stop doofenshmirtz and his unnamed gang of evil scientists before they broadcast their message of evil and interrupt what has quickly become mine and carl's favorite show.  nikki: well, this shindig is in full swing.  looks like the judges are starting to eliminate dancers.  who will survive.  you know, they're eliminating people.  let's kick it up a notch.  people of the tristate area, you may begin quaking in fear at your earliest possible conveniencewait, really.  were. were you even watching that move.  hello, my future subjects, it is i, alois everard elispearls before swine.  so i represent the league of villainous evildoers maniacally united for frightening investmentsah, philistine, thatthat was a perfectly good charleston.  . yeah, yeah, yeah .  wow, you are really good.  bravo, bravo.  go candace.  . ooh, ooh .  oh,

pushing this dancer out of the way, it's me.  oh, no, doofenshmirtz.  i was here first.  am i gonna have to talk to your hand again.  rodney: maybe in your own mind.  . let's dance .  rodney: no. mine.  this is awkward.  . go, perry .  nikki: and look, there's only one dancer left standing.  let's see what he does.   say, that was some fabulicious dancing out there.  i see quite a future for someone with moves like that.  is she saying what i think she's saying.  how'd you like to dance till you're sick every week.  do it, jeremy. do it.  we could be stars.  dancing stars. we cancandace, i can't do this.  all those great dance moves i've been doing todaywell, it was actually...    that's kind of disturbing.  it was this crazy contraption doing all those dance moves.  if you want to see what a real dancer looks like, then here you go.   well, it looks like my work here is done.    but i'm sorry about all this, candace.  ii just didn't wanna let you down.  oh, jeremy, you weren't gonna let me down.  i just wanted you to come out with me and have a good time.  and you know, dance till we're sick.  well, i am feeling a little dizzy.  i got you, big guy.    they should have called it let's all dance till we're in intensive care.   hey surfers, we're going behind the scenes  of the latest disney movie.  .movie surfers..   the dagger turns back time.   i've seen its power with my own eyes.   the producer of pirates of the caribbean, jerry bruckheimer,  brings us prince of persia: the sands of time.   i've never been involved in something this much fun.   it's just, it's magical.   it's a mix of everything visual effects, action, comedy.   there's cool characters.  he has to be stopped.  he has to be stopped, he has to be stopped.   it just goes beyond that level of what you're used to seeing.   this epic adventure tells the story of dastan,  an ordinary kid from the streets who becomes  a master of parkour.  that's impossible.  difficult, not impossible.  dastan starts off as just a kid from the streets.  well i do parkour, freerunning.  it's fun and hard work,  but the fun kind of takes over the hard work.   jake has so much action but he does really well at it.   he's a bit of an action figure himself, i think.   being the hero in a movie is so much fun.   i did parkour training.  i just got into the best shape  i could in terms of learning how to run on walls  and jump off of things.  so when surfers watch the movie, what scene can they look at that was actually influenced by parkour training.  well there's a scene where jakeis running through a dark tunnel  being chased. he runs up the walls of the tunnel  and jumps and takes him off the horse.   so he does everything in that one scene.   after seeing some of jake's amazing moves,  we thought it was time for us to give parkour a try.  let's go surfers.  you won't want to miss this.   so we met up with forrest, a parkour expert who taught us  all the right moves.   yes.   yes.   here we go.   i love this.   good job.  it's nothing.  well surfers, this is just a taste of what jake had to go through for his training,  but you can check out all the amazing stunt work in  prince of persia: the sands of time, directed by mike newell,  coming to theatres soon.   wow.   . there's 104 days of summer vacation and school comes along just to end it . so the annual problem for our generation . is finding a good way to spend it . like maybe...  . building a rocket . or fighting a mummy . or climbing up the eiffel tower.  . discovering something that doesn't exist hey.  . or
