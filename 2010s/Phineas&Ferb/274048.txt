it's just a little bit of "how's your father." i may seem like a barmy ol' git now, but when i wasn't so long in the tooth, i had some grand larks and engaged in a fair amount of derringdo.  translate.  when he was younger, he did a bunch of stuff.  here i am as a young lad.  i made my living workin' at the family fish and chips shop.  but i was destined for bigger things.  i was known as the great flying fishmonger.  here's my first jump over my dear mum's tea society.  me jumpin' a whale, a ton of crumpets, the queen mum.  but there was one jump that haunts me to this day mcgregor's gorge of doom.  people turned out by the thousands to witness me and my trusty motorbike, the holy mackerel, make our biggest jump yet.  the event was so massive, i hired a local band to write me a theme song.   . he's a fishmonger, and he flies... .  well, it wasn't exactly a toetapper.  then all of a sudden, it started to rain.  i'd have to postpone my great feat.  a second go at it weeks later had the same result.  and yet another attempt nothin' but blasted rain again.  let's go.  yeah.  i've got teeth not to brush.  over the years, my eyesight went, and with the lumbago...   ...sciatica...   bursitis and...  wait for it...   ...trick knee, jumpin' mcgregor's gorge is an intention lost to the past.  wow, grandpa, so what ever happened to the holy mackerel.  she's right over there.  although i see your mother turned her into a lamp.  ferb, i know what we're gonna do today.  oh, grandma, you're gonna love this mall.  i'll show you my favorite store, and there's this little dress that hmm.  stacy, i have a strange feeling that ground was just broken in my backyard.  i need you to get over there and tell me what's going on.  judging from this photo of mcgregor's gorge, we're right on track.  who's the tiger.  hey, phineas, whatcha doin'.  hey, isabella.  we're helping grandpa reg fulfill his crushed dreams.  where's ferb.  he's in the garage restoring a
