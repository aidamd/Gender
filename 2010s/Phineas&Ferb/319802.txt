problem for our generation . is finding a good way to spend it . like maybe . building a rocket, or fighting a mummy . or climbing up the eiffel tower . discovering something that doesn't exist hey.  . or giving a monkey a shower . surfing tidal waves . creating nanobots or locating frankenstein's brain it's over here.  . finding a dodo bird painting a continent . or driving our sister insane phineas.  . as you can see, there's a whole lot of stuff to do . before school starts this fall come on, perry.  . so stick with us, 'cause phineas and ferb are gonna do it all.  . so stick with us, 'cause phineas and ferb are gonna do it all. .  mom, phineas and ferbare making a title sequence.  perry the platypus.  this is the most sophisticatedtrap i have ever invented.  in fact, it's so escapeproofthat guy out.couldn't get so i had to build a wholenew trap to catch you.  and, of course, i'll have tofor halloween.tic skeleton it's a pitiableplatypus. do, do you pity me.  you should, 'cause i'm pitiable. everyone should pity me.  you don't have to say pity too many times before it stops sounding like a word.  pity.  pity, pi... see, that's only, like, two times and it's already just gobbledygook.  gobbledygook, too. i, i can't even get through that once. gobbledy...  see. i, i'm not even to the last syllable and it's already...   great. now i've forgotten what i was talking about.  which is another reason to pity me.  yeah. back on topic, baby.  you see, i figured if i give people would pity me and give me whatever i want.  and to that end, behold. the bigsadeyeinator.  you like it.  it sucks up a lot of juice, so i'm running it at night when electricity's cheaper.  but the night time is the right time for a party...  a pity party.   here we go.  don't worry about a thing, mom. everything's under control.  thanks, candace. it's been too long since your father and i had a date night.  thirteen days, 22 hours and 17 minutes.  how do you know that. i've got an app on my phone.  don't worry about us. bye.  parents are weird. yes, yes they are.  it takes a while to get warmed up, but we're almost there.  what the...  see, i told you it took up a lot of juice.  what happened. i think we blew a fuse.  don't get all technical on me, just fix it.  relax, candace. ferb and i'll check the fuse box.  in the meantime, you go find a flashlight.  candace: okay. find a flashlight. find a flashlight.  hey, ferb, isn't it cool how you can still see people's eyes in... ferb.  where'd you go. oh, you prankster.  candace: i know we have a flashlight in here somewhere.  uh, okay, that's a stapler.  ow. scissors. and what is this, an old banana.  ew.  what happened to all the flashlights. aha.  darn. the batteries are dying. i better conserve them.  phineas, ferb.   oh, who leaves a chair right next to a table.  phineas: looks like the whole town's in a blackout.  buford: what you doing.  isabella. your voice sounds horrible.  fooled you. it's me, buford.  and my voice isn't horrible, it's raspy.  you gotta spend hours screaming in a closet to get it like this. hours.  isabella: hey, phineas. what you doing.  there's the original. i'm glad you're here, isabella.  ferb and i are working on something that will give us all the best blackout ever.  baljeet: can i help.  sure you can, baljeet. hey, baljeet.  hey, buford. your voice is so raspy.  it sounds as if sandpaper and a washboard had a baby.  see. closet time's paying off.  phineas: okay, guys. let's get to work.  candace: hey. hold it right there. who else is back here. roll call.  well, there's ferb, isabella, buford, baljeet, and me.  oh, and there's that kid in the corner with the eye patch.  kid: but is it my left eye or my right eye.  you don't know.   hi, mom. yeah, we're okay. in fact, i was just about to call you.  i can't see what phineas and ferb are making, but i'm sure it's bustable.  well, it'll have to wait. traffic lights are out all over the city.  of course, you know i'd like nothing better than to give up my special time with your father to run home and not see what they may or may not have done.  i can't remember, were you always this sarcastic.  shh.they're using a winch, mom.  they're making something huge and...    buford: candace found the wood chipper, guys.  my phone.  oh, we got disconnected. now who's going to grate on my nerves all night.  oh, so you have always been this sarcastic.  oh, that's right, it's going to be you.  you betcha, ducky.  one way or another, i'm gonna see what all you eyeballs are making back here.  sure. i want everyone to see, including perry.  hey...  where's perry.  chorus:  . doofenshmirtz isn't illuminated.  .  a blackout.  oh, perry the platypus, isn't this wonderful.  now, people can't see anything but my pitiful eyes.  look at them, perry the platypus. don't you feel sorry for me.  don't my sad, lugubrious eyes elicit compassion and mercy.  your secret agent training has taught you to squint well, my nemesis, but you can't fight the power of these pathetic, pleading eyes.  well, i guess you can, 'cause you're heartless, perry the platypus.  you know that where your heart should be, nothing.  but the common man will not be able to.  i'm gonna go find someone on the street and test these babies out.  and you're coming with me. here. come on.  it's a good thing i put wheels on this trap.  try to keep up.  phineas: somebody hand me that wrench.  isabella: the power transformer is online.  baljeet: it's a good thing that you have this bicyclepowered generator.  phineas: we like to be prepared for any eventuality.  thanks for pedaling, by the way.  buford was supposed to take over half an hour ago, but i cannot find him anywhere.  buford: and you're not gonna. buford, is that you.  buford: no.  come on, you stupid thing, work. there. now, where is it.  pid thing.   what are you guys building.   an antigravity device.  phineas: nah, that's just the crane.  tighten the servomotor. isabella: ayeaye.   candace: well, i'm gonna feel my way through this.  okay, this feels like... metal.  and this is some kind of wooden railing.  ooh, mushysquishy.  phineas: we're not using any mushysquishy stuff.  but that's perry's favorite spot.  ew. okay, gross.  can't you just tell me what you're building.  i'd love to. but it's kind of hard to put it into words.  you really just have to experience it.  fine. fire it up.  great. put on this helmet. and this mouthguard.  and this lead apron. arms up and you're ready to go.   okay, okay. this isn't so fast...   . what is this thing that keeps dragging me around.  . is it mechanical. i recognize the sound . and i'd give anything to be back on the ground . what is this thing. what is this thing.  yeah . what is this thing, is it just a state of mind.  . if this is venice then i've gone venetian blind . i think my sanity is starting to unwind . what is this thing. what is this thing.  yeah . what is this thing. what is this thing.  yeah . is it a car wash or a pair of ankle weights . is it an apple or commemorative plates . there's a phrase that comes to mind electromatic transfix . que es esto. what is this thing. yeah . what is this thing. what is this thing.  yeah .  phineas: wow, candace. i never thought of riding it before.  i think i swallowed the mouthguard.  doofenshmirtz: okay, perry the platypus.  i see someone.  you'll understand the power of my sad eyes when you see them in action.  you ready. watch this.  excuse me.  man 1: oh, you look so sad. i feel so sorry for you. what can i do.  here, take this. there. and as soon as i find my home, i'll come back and bring you more free stuff, you poor, poor thing.  you see. and i don't even know what it is.  man 2: sir, your eyes. they compel me to help. let me contribute.  here.  thank you, kind sir. why is it so warm.  woman 1: your eyes bring out my mercy.  don't they just.  man 3: here, take all i have.  you gave me a wig. no.  man 4: ooh, take that.  man 5: please take this.  man 6: my toaster.  man 1: my watermelon.  man 7: oh, let's all go get him more stuff.  man 4: jetpack squad, away.  wow, if it worked on that jetpack squad, i bet you it'll work on my brother, roger.  maybe he'll take pity on me and make me mayor.  that's just a hop, skip, and a jump from having people give me the whole tristate area.  monogram: thank goodness your wrist communicator is still working, agent p.  we traced the blackout to the danville power plant on fifth street.  i know you're busy with doofenshmirtz and you don't normally handle stuff like this, but i was in the middle of microwaving a burrito and the center is still totally frozen.  just figured you were close and, uh...  hurry, agent p, it's, it's kind of scary in here and i'm all alone.  ccarl. carl, is that you.  candace: how can i bust you if i don't know what you made.   dad's unmistakable twohonk horn signal.  they're home.  mom. dad. you're home.  hi, sweetie. the restaurant was closed because of the blackout.   all that noise.  phineas and ferb made a dangerous thing in the backyard, in the dark.  oh, this stupid fence. why do we have this stupid fence here.  dad, tear down this fence.  what do you think. should we tear down the fence.  oh, that's that sarcasm i like.  see, wait, you could feel what they made.   mom: candace. my arm.  you know, perry the platypus, i didn't realized this trap would be so heavy.  city hall is still, like, a few blocks away.  you don't mind if i just leave you here, do you.  hello.   where's perry.  the platypus.  that's all it was. that big red switch over there.  you think i would have known that. i mean, i've got a phd.  you work that into every conversation.  candace: okay, can you feel it, mom. can you feel it.  i feel something pointy.  you're right, ferb. we're cooler even in the dark.  hi, boys. wait. where is that incredibly huge and dangerous thing that you all built.  a bunch of guys on jetpacks came by and asked if they could have it, so we gave it to them.  oh, you boys are so cute.  but what is it. what was it.  so, why is it that you think i'm going to just hand over my mayorship to you.  because i've got these big sad eyes.  yeah. and they're kind of freaking me out.  yeah, i, i guess it probably works better in the dark.  oh, look, it's the jetpack squad.  man: here, sadeyed man. we brought you this.  doofenshmirtz: aw, i think i swallowed my mouthguard.  buford: so then the seamstressand says, "'titanium'.ateroom "i thoughtshe said 'cranium'."  yeah.pretty good punch line, huh.  yes. all you need is the firstwhole joke.hen you'll have a hey, look, everyone.ferb and perry are back.  hey, ferb.  whatcha doin' back fromdebate camp so soon.  we finished earlier than expected.  you're right. judges, he's right. he's changed my entire worldview. thank you.  it's so beautiful.  that kid is in it to win it, dawg.   you're just in time for acorn nut muffins made out of the training nuts from yesterday.  training nuts. okay, what did i miss.  it all started simply enough. i'd gotten up early to help isabella earn her surf patch.  thanks for helping me earn my surf patch.  phineas: and i told her it was no problem.  no problem.  it was at that point that i decided to stop narrating.  my schedule's wide open. here, take a look at this. i figured i'd make a few prototypes and once you pick your favorite, we'll design your board to look just like it.  aw, they're so cute and tiny a squirrel could surf on them.  now, if we only had a box of squirrels.  baljeet: we found a box of squirrels.  yeah, right next to a box of scorpions, which is what i wanted to bring over.  buford, i won rochambeau fair and square.  what's rochambeau. rockpaperscissors.  why didn't he just say that.  in what universe would a piece of paper ever beat a rock.  hey, let's see the little guys.  okay, but do not expect too much from them.  what's wrong with them.  they appear to have been domesticated. they have no squirrel skills. check it out.  it's a nut, you eat it. i see what you mean.  no squirrel skills. ferb, i... oh, that's right, he went to debate camp today.  oh, oh. i will be ferb. i have been practicing.   that's pretty good, baljeet. wow.  it's as if he's right in front of us.  oh. oh. say "where's perry." now. i've been practicing.  okay. where's perry.  i don't know. what are you asking me for.  and so, that's how the day began. hey, where's perry now.  welcome back, agent p. we hope you had a pleasant day off.  anyways, there's a crisis brewing in danville, and it could destroy the very fabric of our existence.  there's never been a greater threat.  peaches.  oh, you probably want me to explain the...  there's been a shortage of peaches in danville lately, and we've traced it to doofenshmirtz.  go find out what he's up to, and good...   luck.  wow, guess he's in a hurry.  it was about that time that candace came up to us and said...  phineas and ferb. i demand to know what it is that you've got planned today.  yeah, that. exactly like yesterday.  except for the ferb part.  yeah, yeah, thanks. what are you guys doing.  we're talking about what we did yesterday.  so it's, like, a confession.  sure. oh, it's perfect.  i'll go get mom and she can hear everything.  good idea, can...  now, don't say another word until we get back. and that goes for you, too.  that was ironic, because ferb doesn't usually talk.  duh.  hello, perry the platypus. i take it for granted sometimes what a professional you are, especially after dealing with that guy they sent instead of you yesterday.  so how was debate camp.  you're right. judges, he's right. he's changed my entire worldview.  and i thought that british kid was persuasive.  you know, if you were flashing back just now, i couldn't see it.  i'll bet you're wondering what i'm doing here at the beach...  at the clam bake...  with an oven.  and normally i'd be all about telling you, and it's a really cool plan, too.  it involves my latest invention, the peachcobblerinator.  but i'm getting way ahead of myself.  i have to tell you about yesterday for any of this to make any sense.  it all started with an establishing shot of my building.  chorus:  . doofenshmirtz evil incorporated.  . yesterday .  huh. perry the platypus should be arriving right about... now.  how completely unexpected.  and by that i mean, it really was actually unexpected.  well, you have a hat, so you must be an agent.  i guess that means perry the platypus is not coming, so...  aha.  consider yourself trapped. allow me to explain my diabolical plan.  you see, my brother, roger, the mayor, is hosting a beauty contest that will...  hey.  for pete's sake, i'm pontificating here.  sheesh.  okay, okay. long evil plan short, i wanted to ruin roger's day.  you see, he's officiating at an "everyone's a winner" beauty pageant.  that's so him.  uh, my scheme involved domesticated squirrels, paper doilies, and those containers that pantyhose used to come in. you know, about this big.  but, uh, i couldn't figure out a way to make them all work together because i was distracted by a leaky faucet in the kitchen.  turns out that that was actually the perfect idea.  so i ditched the squirrels...  you know, this isn't really making my evil plan short like i promised.  sorry. anyway, behold. the aleakyfaucetinator.  i will disgrace and humiliate roger by dropping one big drop of water and...   hey, where'd you go. oh, no. you're getting coffee grounds everywhere.  this is so much smoother with perry the platypus.  i'm just saying.  right out here, mom. hi, kids.  all right, what's this all about.  we're telling ferb the story of what we did yesterday.  oh, i love stories. oh, oh, it's not just stories, but full disclosure.  okay. go ahead.  well, we finally got to the musical part of the story.  we all decided it was high time to teach the squirrels how to be squirrels.  . so you've been domesticated lost your identity c'mon. c'mon.  . just listen up and you can learn to be the best that you can be . gather nuts and scurry and dodge a car or three . if you concentrate you'll graduate . and learn to climb a tree . but for now we'll show you how to make every chestnut count . we'll make you sweat you won't regret . remember, put them in your mouth . be a squirrel . come along, be a rodent trainee . be a squirrel . and you will finally be free . be a squirrel . be at the top of your family tree . be a squirrel . . be a squirrel it's your destiny .  buford, you taught the squirrels to dance.  i'm like an onion.  because you have layers.  yeah, that, too.  anyway, after i cleaned up the coffee grounds, i loaded the aleakyfaucetinator and agent r, i guess, onto my rocket skiff and headed off to roger's beauty contest.  we arrived just in time for the swimsuit competition.  very nice. twelve meters. we have a new record.  there he is, the big showoff. with his big smile and his keys in his pocket and his lumberjacklike...   hey. hey, no. shoo. shoo.  get out of here. go find another symbiotic relationship.  anyway, now that we've... hey, hey. what do you... this actually feels great.  oh, i see why you like it.  anyway, and i'm going to power up the inator now.  here we go. powering up.  yup.  you know, uh, this is the time where you escape and try to destroy my inator.  oh, for pete's sake, i... there. now, attack.  start thwarting. no... no, no, no, no, don't just walk awa...  i miss perry the platypus.  whoa. wait, wait, wait. watch out there.  why isn't the water coming off.  it's beautiful.  good job, cadets. now, back down the tree.  no, not like that. head first. sheesh, it's like i'm talking to myself here.  let's go, mom. you got to see this.  wow, look at 'em go.  they're doing a pyramid. i didn't even teach them that.  good luck, little guys. i'll think of you whenever i get a rabies shot.  which is often.   thank you, katie bogosian, for the whistling belly button performance.  you probably should see a doctor.  but that concludes our talent competition, unless there are any lastminute dropins.   it's so beautiful.  that pharmacist is in it to win it, dog.  see, i'm actually talking to a dog. that's right.  talking to a dog.  and i was crowned king pretty pretty princess.  which, now that i think of it, is a contradiction in terms, but it was the first time i ever won anything.  so it's gotten me all obsessed about entering contests.  but the only thing i'm good at is baking peach cobbler, so i, i invented...  oh, yeah. i told you, "behold the peachcobblerinator." what it does is it makes everyone want peach cobbler more than anything else in the world.  so whether it's a chili cookoff or a dancing competition or a quilting bee, or whatever, the, the judges will be compelled to choose peach cobbler as the winner every time.  plus, it's waterproof, it's shockproof, it's windproof, it's...   huh. but it isn't sandproof.  fancy that.  i suppose, since i planned to take it to the beach, maybe i should have considered...  curse you, perry the platypus, and my own poor planning skills.  oh, no. my cobbler.  oh. how can this day get any worse.  ow. does that mean this thing's been flying around since yesterday.  so, there you have it. are you gonna bust them, or what. wait.  okay, go ahead.  actually, i just love that you kids trained poor, abandoned little squirrels and helped them get back to the wild. i am so proud of you.  no, you can't. i want justice. i want...  peach cobbler.  well, lucky for you, i made peach cobbler.  peach cobbler.  i heard you the first time, honey.  . been domesticatedlost your identity c'mon. c'mon.  p and you canthat you can be best . gather nuts and scurryand dodge a car or )
