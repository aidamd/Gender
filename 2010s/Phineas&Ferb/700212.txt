challenge for kids of our nations .  . is finding a good way to spend it .  ah, christmas eve.  it was a great idea to climb back into bed this morning.  oh, i almost forgot.  helmets.  all set.  let's do this thing.  . like maybe .  . turning our beds into dual toboggans .  . and sliding down a ski jump tower .  . building a snowman the size of colossus .  . or giving a yeti a shower .  . staging a snowball fight with giant catapults .  . and snow angels that really fly .  . rocking a christmas carol wrapping a present .  . or just shoveling snow off the drive .  well, they can't all be fun.  . as you can see there's a whole lot of stuff to do .  . before school starts next year .  . so stick with us 'cause phineas and ferb .  . are gonna spread some christmas cheer .  . so stick with us 'cause phineas and ferb .  . are gonna spread from christmas cheer .  mom. phineas and ferb are making a christmas special.  we're slowing down.   i see why dogs enjoy this sensation.  delayed.  what do you mean delayed.  candace, honey, the snow storm has delayed your grandparents' plane.  your father and i have to wait here at the airport until they arrive.  it may be hours.  but i need your help.  stacy told me that marcus told her that jeremy told him that he got the perfect gift for me.  oh, no, how will you manage.  mom, think.  if jeremy found the perfect gift for me, then i have to find the perfect gift for him.  i thought you already got a gift for jeremy.  i did, but i can't show up with an obvious, stupid present that anyone could have gotten him.  the perfect gift means that you totally get the other person in the most deep and paying attentiony way.  if his gift to me is perfect and my gift to him isn't, he's gonna be so hurt and insulted, and think i'm lame and thoughtless and he'll stop liking me.   oh, candace, honey.  i don't thinkyou poor thing.  forgive me, boys.  what are your brothers up to.  not a thing.  which is weird.  what are they up to.  love you, mom. gotta run. bye.   plow.    phineas: house.  we're coming in too fast.  those two are so busted...  for lollygagging in bed.  that's not like you two.  we've been working on a way to seize the day while also not having to get out of bed so early.  i think we can cross that one off our todo list.  let me see that.  what is this.  number one was "write letters to santa." what, did you start this to do list when you were three years old.  we write letters to santa claus every year, don't you.   )
