"phineas and ferb present the coolest coaster ever.  now open." mom.  phineas and ferb got a rollercoaster.  you think we get a discount if we bring the flier.  i think we better take it.  here. look, look, look. see.  i told you i'm not crazy. i told you.  ..  aah.  i see your point, candace.  no crazy person would scream at a post like that.  i'll be in the dairy section if you want to come yell at some cheese or anything.   ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, children of all ages.  may i present to you a spectacle most of the morning in the making, ..  ..  ever.     so, who wants to go first.  to fasten, insert the tab into the metal buckle.  to release, just pull back on theoops.  well, you get the picture.  well, that's about it. enjoy the ride.  you all signed the waivers, right.  aah. aah. aah.   aah. aah. aah.  relax, they're just rubber.    hey, look, here comes the aahaahaahaah.  all: aahaahaahaah.  but i really make all my money back.  iii could buy a bunch of eastfacing real estate .. hah. you missed.  ow.  owowowow.  ow.  oww.  how do you like the lanai.  quake in your boots and watch helplessly as the unimaginable electromagnetic forces pull the eastern seaboard, thereby reversing rotation of the earth.  ..that didn't work.  and now we have a 2ton ball of tinfoil traveling 200 miles an hour directly at us.  we must separate the magnet from the magnifier before it is too late.  now, i know i have that club card in here somewhere.  i always have it with me, but my purse is such a disaster area.  you know how it is.  oh, oh, oh, oh. mom.  mom.  it's no use.  it's no use. we are doomed.  you did it.  you saved us, perry the platypus.  bless you, perry the platypus.  look, look, look, look. see.  ok, i give up.  what am i supposed to be looking at.  no. it's not possible.  i'm gonna go get the cart.  it was right here and it was huge.  mom.  time to go. i've got frozen.  ok.  so you think that phineas and ferb are still under that stupid tree in the backyard, right.  well, yes, that would be my guess.  fine. then let's go homenow.  oh, there you are, perry.   nice hat, isabella.  hmm.  aah. aah.   funny. i don't remember this in the blueprints.  and i'm sure this is new.  heeheeheehee.  i worry about you sometimes, candace.  may i take your order.  anyone want fries.  croissant.  anyone want acroissant.   you know, if that thing crashes to earth, candace is in charge.  aah. aah. aah.   we should have charged more.  ok, we're here. are you happy now, candace.   yes. see, mom. i told you they weren't there.  hi, mom. oh, hi, boys.  come on, candace, help me with the groceries.  bbbbbutbutbutbutlet's go.  butbutbutbutbuthey, phineas, that was great.  way too cool.  that was awesome.  can we do it again.  sorry. only one ride per customer.  that was great, phineas.  so, what are you gonna do tomorrow.  don't know yet.  maybe you can teach perry some tricks.  well, heisa platypus.  they don't do much.  they're the only mammals to lay eggs.  maybe he'll lay an egg.  cool. see you tomorrow.  it really was the coolest coaster ever.  you guys make a great team.  well, a brother is a brother, but i couldn't have asked for a better one that ferb.  you know what i mean.   oh, man. i can smell the peanut butter.  well, that was impressive.  see you, guys.  so what should we do tomorrow.  there's a world of possibilities.  maybe we should make a list.    candace: mom.  give it a rest, candace. )
