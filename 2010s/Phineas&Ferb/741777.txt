built a beach in the backyard, just like they said they were going to.  but instead of just a cute little beach in their sandbox, it turned out to be this absolutely huge beach, with a coastline and palm trees and a pier and hula dancers and water skiers and tiki huts and dolphins and dancing and surfing, and everybody from the neighborhood showed up.  oh.  candace: and then i was just about to share a smoothie with jeremy when a coconut dropped on my head andand just for moment, it seemed that the wily buford would steal away the coveted surfing trophy from under the noses of our heroes.  candace: but i can only continue my benign reign and spread love, happiness, and ultimate popularity throughout my kingdom if you would just let me have my moment.   oh, there you are, perry.   well, everybody, looks like that's all for today.  all: phineas and ferb. phineas and ferb.  phineas and ferb.  if you don't believe me, go see for yourself.  that was great.  mom: hey, boys. hey, mom.  so, how was your day at the beach.  candace: wait, wait. my kingdom.  my jeremy. it was all so beautiful.  .  candace, honey, i think it's time to get you out of the sun for a little while.  i think she
