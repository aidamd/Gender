"but, doof, you have a terrible singing voice." well, feast your eyes on this little baby.   tada. i call it the yodelinator.  pretty cool, huh.  ohoh, right. you just think it's a big cowboy hat.  it is so much more.  see. huh. see.  it's designed to make my singing voice sweet and mellifluous.  so my first gig is in an hour.  come one, you can help me hand out fliers.  everyone's going to love me.   mom: you can do this, candace.  just look into the turn and ease your foot off the brake.  i'm lllooking into the turn mom, look.  phineas and ferb.  candace, i don't find that funny.  no. behind the bus.   they were building some contraption.  i'll show you.  mom: oh. candace, slow down.  nice work as usual, ferb.   all we need now is the final ingredient.  hey, phineas. we got the sap you guys needed. here.  thanks.    at this stage, the maraca nut sap isn't fully congealed, so we can pass through the semipermeable membrane with ease.  voil.  girls, i think we all just earned our passingthroughasemipermeable membrane patches.   girl: yeah.  see. there, theyperhaps i should get tired of asking this, but what am i looking at.  ugh. they were right there and thehold on to

schedule is totally blown.  i am going to miss my polka recital.  buford: i've heard you.  it's a small loss.  candace, trash cans again.   oops, my bad, hehheh.  where'd they go.  candace, i think we've had quite enough of your driving.  not now, mom. i have to get this car into the sky.   mom: candace.  uhoh. how long are we going to be up here.  a while.  andand how do you even steer this thing.  we're at the mercy of the breeze.  haha. sure, when you say it like that it sounds relaxing.  hey, everybody, downdraft.   baljeet: oh, no, look out.  power lines.  girls, you know what to do.  girls: lean.   cactus garden.  isabella: lean.   public art.  gretchen: with our angle of descent, leaning will be ineffectual.  all: what.  we're gonna crash.  oh, no, i knew i should not have forsaken the rigid beauty of my candycolored schedule.   the bubble's expanding.  it's baljeet's breathing.   it's blowing the bubble up.  everybody breathe heavy like baljeet.  all: yes, sir.   phineas: we're doing it.  girls: yeah.  baljeet, you totally saved us.  when in danger, i always hyperventilate.  thank you.  thank you very much.  i'm next, perry the platypus.  after this concert i will be the most wellliked man in the tristate area.   : . let me tell you my evil scheme .  . i'm gonna enslave your minds with a predictable melody .  . and uncomplicated rhymes .  . and if i asked

different types of music.  woman: that song was horrible.  man: yeah, those lyrics was way too on the nose.  okay, that wasn't as successful as i'd hoped.  but at least i can beat a hasty retreat before i'm too humiliated.  huh.   for your information, i had these way before i met you.  okay. see you tomorrow.  candace.  watch where you're going.  they're around here somewhere.  ooh, ooh.

kibosh on it.   hey, guys.  what you doing.  well, to be perfectly honest, i don't know what i'm doing.  i don't know what i've been doing, always getting so wrapped up in these silly projects that i don't care about.  it's you i care about, isabella.  can we be together forever and ever.  yeah.  we can definitely do that.  excellent.  while they're getting that, we can finish our designs on the transponder.  see you girls back at the field.  okay, phineas. oh, my gosh.  what did he say.  what does he need.  i was in phineas land again. )
