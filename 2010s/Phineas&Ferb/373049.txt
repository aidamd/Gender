i'm mr. mystery.  do you like to be befuddled.  bewebewelsweldwelderedbewelderedbewildered.  then behold.  mystery shack.  your onestopshop for mysteriously cheap oddities.   stan: gaze in amazement at wonders so bizarre they defy the very laws of nature.  and in some cases, the very laws of police.  hey, hey. get out of here.  a twoheaded what. an invisible who.  so many questions.  ow. ow. come on.  plus, there's snacksfor the kids.  you can eat that.try and stop you.  but don't take it from me.  take it from me.  what. who are you.  i'm the real mr. mystery.  the great deals at this place are making me see double.  making me see drouble.  droubidiot.  idiot. just do it again.  so get yourself down to the mystery shack, where the real mystery is if you'll make it out alive.  i'm joking.  most, most folks made it out alive.   . sometimes profound .  . sometimes absurd it's soossayssomewords .  if you accidentally eat the prize that comes inside your cereal, does that make you a specially marked box.  bud: from gravity falls maximum security prison, it's li'l gideon's big house.  hi, i'm li'l gideon.  i may be currently incarcerated but i'm turning my life around by spending around the lives of those around me, around.  open your heart to your feelings.  let your dream light out.  oh, killbone.  you're getting so strong.  whoo.  that's li'l gideon's big house, weekdays at six till i get out.  you better listen to little gideon.  thank you, ghosteyes.  i'd do anything for you, dog.  oh, no, the warden.  retreat.  bud: li'l gideon's big house will return as soon as we contain this riot.  it's always worse than you remember.   oh, nuts. i'm standing on baljeet's shoulders and i still can't see anything.  this is nothow it works.  relax, everyone. ferb and i have devised a solution.  hop on.   phineas and ferb.  with technology that's slightly more advanced than what we have today.  mom. you're doing it again.  it helps my arches.  look, guys, it's regent monogram.  and that girl must be princess isabella.  regent monogram, when can i meet some of the local children.  princess, i'm afraid it's just not safe for you in the wide world.  what with doofus khan on the loose...  doofus khan. he has been a plague on our land for far too long.  i promise, once his forces have been defeated, we'll throw you the biggest party money can buy.  of course, it won't cost you anything, because you're a hereditary monarch.  mom, wait till you see what phineas and ferb have done now.  look. look, acrobats.  mom: acrobats. i love acrobats.  candace: no, mom, over there.  oh, no. doofus khan's warriors.   he's going after the royal thingy.  it is called a jiao.   now, you see, this is exactly what i was...  the princess.  buford, get us down there. quick.  the princess. the princess.  doofus khan, why that impertinent...  a taunting scroll. how uncouth.  shall i order the final attack, sir.  no, no, general carl. a full scale attack now would put the princess at risk.  oh, if only master perry had not given up the way of the warrior and gone to live a contemplative life on the unclimbable mountain of unclimbableness.  he could retrieve the princess.  oh, if only someone could reach him and tell him of our plight.  guys, i know what we're gonna do today.  chorus:  . doofus khan's multilevel yurk. .  doofus khan. regent monogram will have your head.  regent monogram will never attack as long as i have his princess.  which should buy me all the time i need to complete my secret weapon.  and take over the triprovince area.  meanwhile, i'm putting you in the penthouse dungeon.  you'll love the view.  of course, i've planted booby traps all along the way.  and i alone know how to avoid them.    must have forgot that one.  oops.  oh, that's right, you're supposed to skip this step and...   it's under control. just testing the system.   oh, yeah, it works.  ooh, wait.  anyway, here you are.  you'll find a nice rack to sleep on, and some rats to keep you company.  so, while you're here, enjoy your stay.  tata, princess, i'll see you...    phineas: there it is, the unclimbable mountain of unclimbableness.  you know what i hate about the unclimbable mountain of unclimbableness.  just to get there, you have to cross the uncrossable river of uncrossableness.  who named all these things.  that guy over there. the redundant scribe of redundantness.  hi, there. greetings, howdy, and salutations.  okay. ferb, do we have anything for uncrossable rivers.  what are they up to now.  oh, that'll do.   baljeet: look, chinese eviscerating fish.  though i suppose, here in china, we just call them eviscerating fish.  "oh, but here we just called them..."  so, how do we get up the unclimbable mountain of unclimbableness.  no worries, buford. i think we have just the thing.  oh, come on.  stupid mountain of stupidness.  actually that was my original name for it.   oops. my bad. sorry, my apologies. mea culpa.  master perry, this is a great honor.  wow, i can't believe he's a platypus.  phineas pulled a jiao with giant mechanical feet out of his backpack, and that's what bugs you.  master perry, doofus khan has kidnapped the princess.  only you can save her.   you mean you won't.  but why, master perry. what made you give up the life of a warrior hero.  what's he doing. that's a ripple dissolve.  he must be having a flashback.  does he know we can't see it.  should we give him some privacy.  i don't know the protocol for flashbacks.  is he back. he's back.  well, judging by the time you spent staring off into space, i'm guessing it's something pretty bad.  but somebody has to rescue the princess.  if you won't come with us, at least you can train us to do it ourselves.   . oh, yeah . in other circumstances you might fail . 'cause i know you don't have a beaver tail . you're not a platypus but i'm gonna see you sweat milk.  . we're going to see how much you can take . i'm going to work you through your union break . you squeeze a silk worm, what do you think you're gonna get.  all: silk.  . but i know a way we can make you a warrior . even though now you're a wuss  . it's the way of the platypus . but that's just the general information.  . here's some of the specific things . you can look forward to in your workout.  . you'll wanna run up a ramp witwing over mud for some reason . at some point you'll drop to your knees when it's raining . and look up into the sky  . you'll stand on a post with your arms out . hey, these flowers are way out of season . you'll fly to a swamp planet . meet a little green man and move big, heavy things with your mind  . but i know a way we can make you a warrior . even though now you're a wuss . it's the way of the platypus  . it's the way of the platypus .  are you sure you won't go with us, master perry.  the kingdom really needs you back.  he's doing it again.  all: goodbye, perry.   where are they.  you know i can't see anything, right.  phineas: follow my lead when we get there.  we're going right in the front door.  buford: i knew we shouldn't have let baljeet drive.  never mind that. you two stay here and fend off the guards.  ferb and i will rescue the princess.  we got it covered. just watch out for booby traps.   we made it. and completely unscathed.  good thing we brought along that yak bladder.  princess isabella, we've come to rescue you.  stand away from...  my hero.  don't worry, princess. we'll take the banister down. it's safer.  holy mackerel.  how did you guys defeat all these soldiers.  we're okay.  there was nothing to it.  no time for flashbacks. we have to go.  what flashback. i'm just rippling.  it relaxes me.  oh, would you look at that.  a bunch of kids running away with the princess.  running away with the princess.  time to take matters into my own hands.   what the heck is that.  it must be doofus khan's secret weapon.  he's headed for the castle. what are we going to do.  i've got an idea.  great googly moogly.  doofenshmirtz:  amazing what you can do with a little bamboo and rice paper, huh.  doofus khan. what have you done with princess isabella.  that's none of your business.  but there's no way she escaped, forcing me to move up my plans. i can tell you that.  you barbarian.  i know i am, but what are you.    you like that. the tongue set me back a week.  but, it was totally worth it.  carl, duck.  no, actually, sir, i think it's a...  oh, that kind of duck.  doofenshmirtz: time for a little remodeling.  we can't take much more of this. what should we do.  surrender. oh, what now.  a giant terracotta warrior.  roughly the same size as my dragon.  left leg. right leg.  doofenshmirtz: what could he possibly want.  oh, look, he's doing that crane thing.   ow.  you know, four centuries from now, that move is going to be real cliche.   of course, being terracotta, you would be fireproof.  all right, manoamano, then.   ow, that's not your mano.  man, they would love this in japan.  what the...  phineas and ferb. mom. mom.  ah, slapsies. i hate slapsies.  oof, oof. ah.   gotcha.  baljeet: he has the key to our defeat.  you make puns when the other guy's down, dumbbell.  doofenshmirtz: oh, poor baby. feeling tired, huh.  allow me to put you to sleep.   ew, who put's armpit hair on a mechanical dragon.  next time don't put your windup key in such an obvious place.  i cleverly hid mine in a spot only an ancient warrior would dare to go.  no. perry the platypus.  ow, hey, hey, careful with the soft palette there.   ferb, the key.  phineas: uhoh. eject, everybody.    look.  a giant, mechanical terracotta warrior.  really, candace, wouldn't that be slightly more advanced than what we have today.  well, that would have been the point.  regent monogram.  princess.  party now. you betcha.  great.  ah, well, back to the drawing board. huh.  compliments of regent monogram.   oh, i hate these things.  insult to injury.  well, all's well that ends well.  perhaps one day we'll devise a way to keep our fair lands safe from barbarian invaders.  you know, i bet these blocks would make a great wall.  ferb, i know what we're gonna do tomorrow.  phineas: well, that took longer than expected.  but it is a great wall.  yeah. so, what do you want to do tomorrow.  what. i kid, we can rest.  how about a game of mahjong.  . hey, these flowersare way out of season . you'll fly toa swamp planet . meet a little green man and move big, heavy things with your mind  . but i know a way we can make you a warrior . even though now you're a wuss . it's the way of the platypus . it's the way of the platypus .   captain barnacles: octonauts, to your stations.  children: barnacles.  kwazii.  peso.  explore.  rescue.  protect.  children: octonauts.   what's our mission today, captain.  i'm ready for anyshiver me whiskers.  what's that big, green thing.  some sort of humongous blob monster heading towards us.  i'm tracking a large mass of plankton to see how wind and waves affect its path.  a mass of what.  dr. shellington: plankton.  that large patch of plankton is actually made up of teeny, tiny little things.  ..oh, yeah.  you see, there are little animals and little green plants in the plankton.  but what's our mission, captain.  ] well, the plankton is our mission for the next few weeks.  you mean, we're just going to sit here and watch little bits of green gunk.  we can learn big things from little things, kwazii.  aye, like how to go stircrazy with your tail stuck in one place.  um, kwazii, i think tweak could use some help with the gupx.  .  well, now you're talking.  i don't know, kwazii.  seems to me you're better at wrecking gups than helping fix them.  oh, come on, matey.  what have you got to lose.  a gup.  please.   )
