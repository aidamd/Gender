 in charge, huh. time to make some new laws.  you realize this is just a temporary position for show.  you don't really have the power to...  so, as mayor, i officially give you the rest of the week off.  well, that's really cute, but...  with pay.  melanie is out. peace.  hey, stacy. how'd you like to be the assistant to the mayor.  coolness. at your service.  at last. candace flynn is in charge.  what'cha doin'.  we're going to build an authentic pioneer town in our own backyard.  and we're only gonna use dad's antique collection of pioneer tools to do it.  that's the spirit, ferb.  hey, where's perry.  morning, agent p.  uh, sorry we have to meet here at the agency sauna.  it's just that if we don't use it at least three times a month, we lose our privileges.  anyway, it's our old friend doofenshmirtz again.  he's been researching both theoretical physics and golf fashion.  sounds like an unholy combination.  so, we're sending you in undercover to stop him.  good luck, agent p.  agent w.  didn't see you there.  how's the old blow hole.  let's get authentic.   okay, stacy, let's get busy. i have a city to run.  the task force recruits are looking pretty good.  wait a minute. new law.  i'm the only one who can wear that color.  duly noted.  new law. everything should be pretty.   new law. free makeovers for the mayor.  good one, miss mayor.  new law. today is "free clothing for the mayor" day.  i'll take that. and i'll take that.  and i'll take that. and i'll take that.  and...  new law.  new law.  new law.      looks like you've left your mark on danville.  what.  i said, it looks like you've left your mark on...  what. i said...  hold on a sec, stace. can we kill the music, please.  oh, brother. i busted my pencil.  "brother. busted." i just realized.  i, like so many other elected officials have forgotten the very promises i made that got me into office in the first place.  that's it. i'm gonna bust my brothers.  yes, mother, i know i promised that i'd spend some quality time with my brother, but, golf, really. i mean...  no, i am not a big baby. i am not.  there he is now. goodbye, mother.  hello, brother dear. sorry we're late. couldn't be helped.  you know how it is. traffic was terrible.  and i've already wasted half the morning not caring at all about being punctual for our golf game.  oh, and this is my caddy, katie.   where's my caddy.   say, you're not my regular caddy.  oh lighten up, heinz.  you know what they say, "you can't be tee'd off once you've teedoff."  that was very funny.  what. who says that.  you know, "they." those guys over there.  both: you can't be tee'd off once you've teedoff.  creepy, huh. i've been trying to ditch those guys all day.  are you sure we haven't met before.  you look so familiar. something about your platypuslike beak. hmm.  can't quite put my finger on it.  well, we're almost done.  all we gotta do now is get rid of those cattle wrestlers.  tag me in. tag me in.  ha. gall dang idgets.  who's that guy.  he's the old coot. every frontier town had one.    man, he can sure spit.  you tenderfoots better high tail it outta here if you know what's good for ya.  this here town was built on top of an ancient indian burial ground.   actually, this is our backyard.  if you find any gold, it's mine.  uh, okay.   if you find any gold, it's mine.  that's right, madam mayor, we're sending the video now.  that's it, boys. good work.  it seems they've built some sort of lame town in our backyard.  it looks like they've done a pretty good job.  really, stacy, really.  gather the press and the media and get them to my house.  this time those pests are goin' down.    heinz. wake up, heinz, we're on to the next hole already.  i hate golf. it's boring to watch and tedious to play.  that's why i came prepared.  you think this is a normal golf bag, don't you.  but when i twist this club here...  behold, the accelerateinator.  with the aelerateinator, i can fast forward my brother through this boring golf game in seconds.  ah, there he is. let's give it a shot.  fast forward.  oh, yeah. look at him go.  welcome, everyone, to the big bust.  today you shall bear witness as i bust my brothers.  all: yay. metaphors.  i want you to take the limo, pick up my mom and dad and bring them back, stat. oh, yeah.  well, guys, we did it.  hundred percent historically accurate oldtimey pioneer town.  yes, complete with hitching posts.  and snake bites.  and deer ticks.  and various sores i'll be nursing for months.  yep. it took a whole lot of toil, pain, sweat and hard work to build this town. we should be proud.  let's never do that again.  agreed. come on, let's go inside the house for a snack.  and air conditioning.  and indoor toilets.  mister and missus flynn.  mayor candace urgently requests your immediate presence at the flynn household.  and so it begins.  oh, yes, i could certainly get used to this.   hello. hey, mom.  yes, candace.  i was just checking to see your approximate arrival time at the flynn household.  candace, this isn't another rant about some imaginary thing your brothers are building, is it.  no, mom. i'm not crazy.   so what time. we're just down the street.  we should be home in a few minutes.    i wonder what will be waiting for me today.  an invisible thing or a nonexistent thing.  i don't believe it.  what on earth.  it's happening.  ladies and gentlemen, without further ado, i give you...   what you've all been waiting for.  look. it's a perfect metaphor, that we should return to simpler ti that's not exactly what i meant.  ha. a perfect metaphor for how history teaches us about our future.  that's pretty good, but no.  it's a metaphor for...  not everything is a metaphor.  candace, what on earth is going on here.  mom, you know all those times i've tried to fill you in on the crazy stunts phineas and ferb have been up to.  yes, candace.  well, this is one of those times.   phineas, ferb, get out here this second.  hey, mom's home.  i'm sorry, candace.  now i know all the crazy exploits you told me about were true.  amazing. the ninth hole already.  feels like we just started and we're halfway through.   this is fun.  there's just one tiny, minor flaw to this machine.  there's a good chance it could tear apart the very fabric of space time, possibly even destroy the universe.  but, i mean, golf, jeesh. totally worth it.  what do you say we amp this up a little.  what, are you out of your mind.   that is it. you two are so...    and now, ladies and gentlemen, it is with great pride that i announce the winner of this year's annual mayor for a day essay contest.   what is keeping roger. he's so rude.  it's a good thing i have my accelerator...  hey. what are you doing.  congratulations to our own local, old coot.  new law. if you find any gold, it's mine.    all: hooray for finding gold being a metaphor for...  oh, wait. i think we're supposed to take that literally.   i was robbed.  .o7' oo /ooo.  .g#o#1 phineas: well, ferb, after that longwinded argument of yours, i agree.  we'll build a monorail to mars.  now, all we need is 36 million miles of steel and...  what is wrong with you two.  can't you think of something normal to do.  like making a lemonade stand or picking your nose, or something.  yeah, that's right.  hey, where's perry.  agent p. i'm glad you're here.  doctor doofenshmirtz has been hoarding all the paper in the tristate area.  find out what he's got up his sleeve, other than, apparently, an enormous amount of paper.  good luck, agent p.   so you boys just try and pull one over on me...  hey, candace.  'cause i'm gonna be on you all day like, like a book on a shelf. no, that's stupid.  candace... like a beard on a face.  ew. no, no, no. candace.  like a light switch on a wall.  that's on. like i am.  on you. candace.  ready to go to the mall.  the mall. uh...  don't mind us ladies.  we're just sitting here making every day of summer count.  you know, i can't really leave right now.  i mean, clearly, i'm gonna have some serious busting to do around here, and you understand, don't you.  no, i don't understand.  we've been planning this for like three weeks.  it's like four months in teenager years.  they're using protractors.  candace, i am tired of taking a back seat to the totally unlikely chance that you'll bust your brothers.  i want a best friend i can count on.  so you're gonna have to choose.  it's me or busting.  you're making me choose. you wouldn't dare.  yuhhuh. yuhnothing.  a real best friend would never do that to me.  a real best friend wouldn't make me do that to her.  then, i guess you're not my best friend.  not anymore.  fine.  fine. fine.  fine. fine.  finally. the plumber. the garbage disposal is stuck again.  the same one you fixed last week, by the way.  and while you're at it...   who needs to see that.  oh, i'll be in the other room.  i mean, oh, for crying out loud.  what, you're done already.  you've only been here for like 15 seconds and i was talking for like half of that.  what kind of a plumber are you.   a platypus plumber.  perry the platypus plumber.  . perry. .  perry the platypus.   amazing what you can do with toilet paper.  which you'd know if you were a real plumber.  in fact, it's amazing what you can do with all kinds of paper.  and no, i'm not a hoarder.  got you.  it's a good thing i threw away a lifelong friendship to keep an eye on you two and your ridiculous, uh...  lemonade stand. we liked your idea so much, we decided to go for it.  and it's turning out to be a big hit.  wow. this is the best lemonade i've ever had.  hit me again.  a regular ol' lemonade stand. that's it.  huh. that means there's, nothing for me to bust today.  which means i have a free day.  phineas and ferb, i gotta hand it to you.  finally acting like normal mediocre kids, doing normal mediocre stuff.  thanks for giving me the day off.  heinz: yeah. that's a lot of paper.  would you like to know what i'm going to do with it all.  well, i'll tell you.    the wheel, the light bulb, the frozen pop with two sticks, so you can give half to a friend.  all profound inventions in their time, but they pale in comparison to the papercutinator.  brainchild of the worldrenowned evil genius, dr. heinz doofenshmirtz.  heinz: i was sick that day.  narrator: this new and exciting inator turns any kind of paper into razorsharp slicing missiles and hurls them toward an unsuspecting tristate area.  watch out, danville.  ouch. something bit me.  narrator: that somethingis evil science, tiger.  good thing the local pharmacy is fully stocked with new doofenshmirtz brand adhesive bandages.  they're terrific. and expensive.  and brought to youby danville's newest soontobe trillionaire, dr. heinz doofenshmirtz.  thanks, heinz.  doofenshmirtz: yeah, that's picture's gonna haunt me.  narrator: and happy evil.  not bad, huh.  i'm gonna do all my "inator" introductions like that from now on.  it's just so much more professional looking.  i'm going to the mall.  i'll call stacy. no, wait. stacy's mad at me.  and i'm mad at stacy.  but i can't go by myself, i'll look like a total dork.  okay. i'll just get a new best friend.  hey, candace. hey there, jenny.  as you've no doubt heard stacy has elected not to renew her option on being my best friend.  so, as someone who has expressed interest in the past, i thought you might want to avail yourself of this exciting opportunity.  come on, candace, you just want someone to go to the mall with you.  will you go.  sorry, but i can't. i've gotta get to the "save the pigeons" rally.  save the pigeons.  okay. gotta cast that net a little wider.  jeremy. no, i can't talk about jeremy with jeremy.  mad at stacy.  jenny. pigeons.  mom. no way.  yuck. how did he even get in here. delete.  okay, who else.  jeremy, stacy, jenny, mom.  jeremy, stacy, jenny, mom.  jeremy, stacy, jenny, mom.  jeremy, stacy, jenny, mom.   how can i only have four friends.  and one of them's my mom.  girl 1: hey best friend. huh.  i have been looking everywhere for you.  oh, my gosh, i don't know you, but okay.  come here. let's go to the mall.  girl 2: hey, did you see that lonely girl.  girl 1: yeah, she was all by herself and singular.  i'm glad people are enjoying our lemonade, but it's getting really hard to keep up.  we better check in with isabella.  isabella, how's phase two coming along.  hold on, phineas. little more to my left.  franchise locations are go.  easy folks, relief is on the way.  here you go.  hey, everyone. it says there's a new phineas and ferb lemonade stand opening with no wait.   they have a lemonade stand inside the grocery store, the book store, and the mall.  it's even being served on my favorite airline.  yeah. oh, yeah.  lemonade. in your face, orange juice.  booyah. that's right. booyah.  lemonade.  okay, no more for that guy.  heinz: let me show you my papercutinator in action.  first we get a piece of paper and then load it in.  ooh. that auto feeder, it scares me every time.  okay, danville.  get ready for some serious minor cuts and abrasions.  i wouldn't want to be getting one of those rejuvenating sea salt scrubs right now.  the stinging would be unbearable.  it just takes a little while to warm up.  wow, finding a new best friend is even harder than i thought.  makes me kind of miss stacy.  why did i let our friendship go.  . today i've learnt a lesson . what a best friend shouldn't do . i put busting my brothers . ahead of you . you were always there for me . on you i could depend . and now too late i realize . i should have been a better best friend  . i said things i shouldn't have . did things i shouldn't do . guess i forgot that you cannot spell "us" without "u" .  so, you lost your best friend, huh.  yeah, i know how you feel.  i lost my best friend once.  little guy, all yellowy and scaly.  his name was biff. turned into this whole bru ha ha.  i had to fight a squid.  wait a minute, wait a minute.  what you're trying to say is that if stacy is really my best friend, i should just apologize to her.  and if i'm really stacy's best friend, she'll take me back.  oh, sure. it's all about you.  it's not too late to fix this.  i can still have a best friend forever.  stacy. there she is. right next to the phineas and ferb lemonade stand.  mom. i'll tell mom. but wait... stacy.  mom... stacy. mom... stacy. mom... stacy.  stom... macy... sassafras... mulberry...  shish kebab, marmalade.  okay. it's almost warmed up.  are you watching, perry the... what. what the...  how did

papercutinator...    explode.  curse you, perry the platypus.  robot: lemon juice.  sorry, folks, we're sold out.   go home, you losers. we're dry.    hey, candace. isn't that stacy over there.  hi,
