candace, have you seen this.  i'm looking at it.  wait, where are you.  mom: in the kitchen.  when i said, "throw these in the kitchen," i didn't mean it literally.  yeah, yeah, yeah.  come on, mom.  candace, i'm not going anywhere until you take care of this mess.  well, fun's fun, but there are those pesky zoning laws.    i just felt a disturbance in the cupstacking universe.  i think my record's been broken.  that wasn't so hard, now was it.  mom, let's go, let's go.  mom, i've been trying to tell you all summer.  they make these amazing things.  look.  candace, you're right.  it is amazing.  hey, mom.  we've built a fort.  it's wonderful.  isn't it great.  the boys are starting to take an interest in building things.  who wants stuff.  phineas: we do.  announcer:" the ultimate thrill ride through the world of disney.  it's a beautiful winter's day, and there's nothing like a little skiing.  oh, hey, buddy, watch out where you'reblam. going.  from this point on, it's all downhill.  ooh, talk about hitting the slopes.  well, i hope he's got a good dentist.  now let's rewind and check out where it all went wrong.  see, right here he's having a hard time seeing where he's going.  whoa, looks like somebody's a tree hugger.  he's wishing he stayed on the bunny slope.  he must be into yogathat's some downward facing dog.  would you like a little ice with your face.  let's try that again with something a little easier.  oh, yeah, a giant ski jump makes sense.  for some reason, he's looking way too confident, but i think he should call his mommy.  oh, yeah, i think he got it.  that looks right.  whoa. let's freeze that.  that's what i call freestyle skiing.  but seriously, this is like the longest ski jump ever.   so remember, don't try this at home, " stacy, we've got about 10 minutes till jeremy's party.  so you've gotta help me decide.  should i go with this swimsuit or this.  hm, that's tough.  if you go with the achromatic pink, it kind of says, "i'm candace and i'm bedraggled and pallid." trust me, you don't want that.  i've been both.  but if you go with the more saturated pink, it kinda gives you that overkill, out to kill, "my currency is urgency" look.  i don't want that.  i've been all three.  let your subconscious do the deciding.  go with the one you touched first.  of course.  stacy, you're a fashion phenom.  which hat should i go with.  i don't think it matters.  yeah, you're right.  i fuss too much.  nothing starts off a day better than some breakfast and some education.  man : we now return to wacky millionaires throughout history.  howard hughes is probably best known for building thespruce goose.  so called because of its wooden frame.  with a wingspan of 319 feet 11 inches, it still holds record for being the largest plane ever built.  wow, that's an impressive record.  319 feet 11 inches is just over the length of a football field, and only one afternoon away from being broken.  ferb, i know what we're gonna do today.  hey, guys, whatcha doin'.  we're making the biggest airplane ever.  cool. coincidentally we're going for our aeronautics patches.  coincidentally we could use extra hands.  coincidentally, we're in.  we're making our plane out of papiermch with newspaper.  why. to make sure it's newsworthy.   and read all over.   oh, oh. haha.  and funny.  hahaha. and funny.  heh.  you know, 'cause'cause the funnies.  hehheh. ah.  but seriously, howard hughes called his plane thespruce goose, 'cause it was made of wood, so we're gonna call ours thepaper pelican.  'cause it's made out of newspaper.  you know, so it will have a good circulation.   aw, come on.  hey, where's perry.   monogram : ah, agent p.  we've discovered doofenshmirtz has been stealing bottles from recycling bins.  and nothing good can come from that.  unless, of course he's recycling, in which case nothing but good could come from that.  unless, he's recycling it into some hideous weapon, which is something once again no good could come from.  except, of course, for the recycling part, which i guess is still, at its essence, good.  even if you're making something evil, it's still reducing theyou know perhaps we shouldn't even put these "good" and "evil" labels on things.  let's just say doofenshmirtz is doing something neutral.  so just get out there and make sure it stays like that.    huh.  . doofenshmirtz evil incorporated .  perry the platypus.   hello.  it's for you, perry the platypus.  haha, prank call.  now, say hello to my new evil weapon.  my evaporatorinator.  it's made completely out of recycled materials.  it's green and evil.  i call it greevil.   backstory time.  you see, perry the platypus, when i was a young boy, my mother would never let me swim in public pools.  no.  what. that's it.  you know, not every backstory has to have some big, indepth spiel, mr. high expectations.   wait...  now we're exactly fashionably late.  we're here.  this is gonna be so cool.  hey.  yeah, totally hey.   that is so cool.  who's that jeremy's talking to.  i have no idea.  i've never seen her before in my life.  i thought jeremy invited me to this party.  let's not jump to conclusions yet.  what is jeremy doing with her.  slow down.  remember how you thought jeremy was with a girl and she wasn't even a she.  you ended up on that snowboard out of control.  yeah. but she's obviously a real girl.  so then i've got two west african pit vipers, and had to dive off a 300foot cliff, and swim up through a school of piranha.  that's awesome, nicolette.  stacy, it's conclusionjumpingto time.  strategy session now.  she's amazing.  she's all exotic and stuff.  she has on the same bathing suit as me, only it's brighter and she wears it better.  she dives off cliffs holding poisonous snakes, into piranhainfested water.  what am i going to do.  she's like catnip for boys.  she's boynip.  nicely done, people.  hey, baljeet, what are
