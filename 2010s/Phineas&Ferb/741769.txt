a wish.  . would you take a good look at me .  . a stand before you as a tree .  . and you ask me what my wish would be .  how come he gets to sing.  shh.  . it's probably related to me being a tree .   . it's my treerelated wish .  . treerelated wish .  . it's my treerelated wish .  . treerelated wish .  . it's my treerelated wish .  . treerelated wish .  . i'll tell you what it is when we get to

candace.  from this point, you have two routes to bustopolis.  on your right is a yellow sidewalk through a terrifying beast bog.  ghouls: we have saliva.   and on your left, ferb and i have built a frozen nondairy treat sidewalk through an ice cream canyon.  you can skate it and lick it for the ultimate in flavorful fun.  ice cream, ice cream.  ice cream, ice cream.  oh, no, you don't.  we're staying on this sidewalk till we meet the wizard and you're busted.  crow, tree, let's go.  both: yes, candace.  well, there's only one thing left to do.  woohoo. yeah.  woohoo.  this is better than an ice cream canyon, isn't it.  oh, yes. i much prefer rotting vegetation and bloodsucking demons.  sure are some scarylooking trees in here.  hey, we can't all be mie stars.  iii think there's someone up there.    baljeet: what is that.  jeremy: where.  it looks like a lion.  no, it looks like a tiger.  i think it is a bear.  nope, i'm a combination lion, tiger and bear.  all: oh, my.  if i had a nickel for every time i heard that.  all right, let's blow this pop stand.  what.  oh, fine.  my friends and i are going to bustopolis to each get something from the wizard.  do you wanna come.  there.  nah.  i don't want nothing.  okay, chopchop, fellas.  time's awasting.  but i am reminded of a song.  . i want... .  nothing.  well, at least it was short.  come on.  all: yes, candace.  . la, la, la, la, la, la.  phineas: hi, candace.  you guys could continue walking through this damp bog, and that would be awesome, but if you'd like to take a more fun route to bustopolis, ferb and i have built...  a blue sidewalk.  a bouncy sidewalk.  what do you say, candace.  you already know my answer.  step it up, freaks.  all: yes, candace.  okay, have fun.   doofenshmirtz: soon those boots will be mine.  in the meantime, i'm going to leave you in the capable hands of my spider monkey, or maybe a monkey spider.  i don't know what he is.     bouncy sidewalk.  i'm keeping my eyes on the prize.   hey, what's that.  looks like a squadron of flying squirrels.    hey, what are you doing.  ow, ow.  i can't believe i'm doing this for nothing.  i wish i was still hanging by my underwear.  just kidding.  come on, i'm a tree.  we're friends with squirrels.  oh, snap.  oh, that's got to hurt.  you get used to it.  : squirrels. squirrels.  whoa.  oh, no, the squirrels have got candace.  we have got to do something.  i got nothing.   oh, hey, candace.  we're taking the bouncy sidewalk.  of course, your way looks fun too.  i am not having fun.  and neither will you if i ever get back to the yellow sidewalk.  kidnapped by flying squirrels and stuck in a web that came out of a monkey's butt.  hm. well, i guess i have had weirder days.   there you are, perry.  silence. i've got you now, missy.  you may as well hand over those boots.  i would, but they've kind of grown on me.  i know. they're nice, aren't they.  and the color really sets off your eyes.  no, really, they've grown on me.  i can't take them off.  if i can't get the boots off of you, i'll have to get you out of the boots.  and by that i mean disintegrate you entirely.  perry, i'm sorry i got you into this mess.  forget about me.  save yourself if you can.  well, if it's that easy...  ah. get him off of me.  oh, he could have rabies.  oh, i hate spiderwebs.   guards.  uh...  ready.  yup.     . agent p .
