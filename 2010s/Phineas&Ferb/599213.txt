 hi, mrs. flynnfletcher. what you doing.  um, i said...   rocking out with the headphones, huh.  hey, what are you losers up to.  it's cosmonaut sergei kushnirov's birthday.  right now, sergei is orbiting earth in an international space station, trying to prove the existence of wormholes.  and in a few hours, he'll be directly above our backyard.  i hope they do not void the sanitation system.  is that the first place your brain goes.  really.  anyway, ferb and i are constructing a stratospheric ionizer, to make a happy birthday message appear in the upper atmosphere.  wow. sounds high tech.  it sure is. hey, ferb, toss me that bone.  hey, sergei, are you still waiting to hear from your american friends.  you're missing party right here.  have some cake.  relax. flame is cardboard.  i'm not an idiot. now, come. it's your party.  i will join you soon, comrades.  phineas and ferb said i should watch the skies for a special message.  those boys are so thoughtful.  oh, look at it, all swollen and useless.  you are one sorry, laidup, mummyfooted bed potato.  why you gotta be all like that. i mean, this is serious.  i can't even get down to the radio station to pick up the backstage passes and...  huh. what's that your brothers are building down there.  what. let me see. let me see.  no way. you gotta stay off that foot.   wait. the video screen.  there they are. doing things.  and there's mom. not noticing.  mom, mom, turn around.  you know she can't hear you. then i'll call her.    hey, this is pretty good.  oh, why doesn't she answer. i'm going down there.  no. stacy, you gotta help me.  okay. thank you.  i am such an enabler.  ah. perry the platypus.  you got yourself in quite a pickle there.  see.  'cause it's a pickle. and you're inside it.  anyway, backstory.  it all started the other day when i was visiting tony's deli.  i had gotten a bowl of chicken soup, but it had a fly in it.  it's a raisin. it's a fly.  it's a raisin.  so, i took it to an entomologist.  it's a raisin.  but on the other side is a fly.  of course, by then my soup was cold and it was too late for a refund.  but now, i will wash tony's deli off the face of the tristate area with my new chicken soupinator.  it blasts out a superconcentrated rocketlike bolt of boiling hot chicken soup powerful enough to demolish an entire city block.  you wouldn't believe how much chicken soup that baby takes, though.  luckily, aaron's deli was having a sale.  half a gallon of chicken soup free with every $40 purchase.  all that chicken soup and it didn't cost me a nickel. haha.  of course, i had to buy a lot of food, mostly deli meats.  they're piled up in the halls.  it's kind of warm in there. i hope they keep.  come on, stacy. come on, stacy.  hey, turn around. turn around.  this is it. yeah, i mean you.  oh, hi, stacy. what.  it's hard to hear over all the noise we're making.  is candace enjoying the live video.  she's watching right now.  hi, candace. we're waving back, but we can't see or hear you.    wow. i'm surprised the spelling checker didn't catch that.  i've got to deliver a message to your mom.  she's right over there.  man: delivery. mrs. flynnfletcher.  oh. hi, stacy. take a look.  oh, the azaleas. you can put those down over there.  okay, lower it here.   oh, poor little regular platypus.  did mean old perry the platypus stick you in there.  hey, why did you do...  perry the platypus.  look, i don't know how you escaped or what you did with the other platypus but here, these twodayold bagels are harder than bessemer steel.  have a nosh.   and how about some potato salad.  take this marble rye.  and here's some braunschweiger.  and some pickled herring.  and, ooh, a red onion.  a gunter flagendorf. but how do you know that sandwich.  he only made one movie and that was back in gimmel...  power test.  mom. mom. mom.  i may as well try that dumb remote.  oh, yeah, i'm free as a bird.  okay, what else.  oh, yeah, this thing and this.  big whoop. big whoop.    mom, turn around.  mom, turn around.  mom, turn around. mom, turn around.  oh, smile, sergei. it is your birthday.  i know. i was just hoping to get a message from the boys by now.  well, until then, you should join us in some fun.  we are going to empty all of our canteens and drink from the giant floating water ball, like ants in rain storm.  okay, okay, but just a sip.  what. a bathroom break.  next time go before you come...  okay, how about some macaroni salad.  antacid. the only effective defense against deli foods.  mom, turn around.  mom, turn around.  mom, turn around.  oh, for crying out loud.   all right, guys. sergei's space station is almost directly above us.  sing into the mic and the stratospheric ionizer will visualize our words.    okay. aone and atwo and...  turn around. turn around.  "turn around".   comrades, listen. evasive maneuvers. quickly.  those boys, they have saved our lives.  and look. we found a wormhole.   yes.  that is what i am talking about.  mom. mom. mom.  12 pickles. how did you even get them all in there.  my chicken soupinator. no.  mom. turn around.  turn around. what. oh, okay.  see. but, but, but, but...  well, i'm glad your ankle's feeling better, dear.  but you should really be lying down.  and look. the kids cleared out the perfect spot for my snapdragons.  i think that earns you some pie.  all: hooray.  oh, not on the flowers, sweetie, i just planted those.  they're lovely.  it's a shame we couldn't get that message to sergei.  i'll try calling his cell.  sergei: hello, i'm unavailable because i'm hurtling through time, and evolving past our human limitations.  so, don't bother leaving a message after the beep.  i guess we'll never be able to wish him a happy birthday.  well, never say never.   what the...  happy birthday.  they did remember. such nice boys.  phineas: hey, dad.it says on this map that america'slargest sport sock is just three milesdown the road.  are we gonnastop there.  i'm sorry, boystill sundownhave to return this rvto the rental place.  we'll have to do it on our next road trip, okay.  i'm ready for this trip to be over.  i'm tired of being in mobile lockdown, where i can't even call my friends because of spotty cell service.  that, combined with the refrigerator door opening every time we make a left and sharing a bathroom the size of a postage stamp.  the only consolation for this whole rigmarole, besides the fact we didn't stop at one of those greasy spoon road stop diners, is the fact that you two haven't done  anything bustable for a whole week.  seven solid days. are you even listening to me.  well, we were at first, but then you got all echoey and far away.  oh, i'm gonna go take a nap.  ferb, candace is right. we didn't get a chance to stop at a classic, allamerican roadside truck stop diner.  you know, the juke boxes, the sassy waitresses, the little bowl of mints by the cash register.   too bad you can't build one.    ferb, i know what we're gonna do today. hey.  there's perry.  ah, agent p, we're sorry. we know you're on vacation, but doofenshmirtz is driving a big rig not far from your current location.  we need you to reroute your family and catch up to him.  find out what he's up to and put a stop to it.  oh, i envy you. the romance of the open road.  the tire chunks all up and down the shoulder and that evermysterious single shoe.  automated voice: turn left at next exit.  hmm, that's odd, but i never argue with a lady.  hey, what's that.  uh, it's a cb radio. i can talk to truckers on it.  talk to truckers. do it.  okay. breaker, breaker, 19.  this is cheeky monkey. anybody got their flappers on out there.  cheeky monkey. oh, that's me. it's my handle.  how do you know how to use a cb radio.  simple, i studied this.   yes, yes, yes, handle it carefully, dear.  doofenshmirtz: hello. cheeky monkey.  oh. oh. you got someone.  yes, yes, this is cheeky monkey.  you're shaking the windows.  what's your handle, good buddy. come back.  a handle. handle, handle.  oh, my name. uh, yeah, you got misfortune here.  well, hello, miss.  no, no. it's not miss, it's misfortune. like, like one word.  it's like... it means bad luck. one word.  so, uh, where are you.  oh, we're running a double nickel on a dime.  double nickel on a...  55 on the 10.  oh, yes. very clever.  well, let's see. i'm eastbound with a smoky on my 20, on a cab over louie with...  you know, i'm gonna level with you.  i don't know where i am or what i'm saying, really. is there a code for that.  no worries, miss. just keep your metal up and your rubber down.  metal up. what kind of...  hey. cheeky monkey, i'm gonna have to call you back.  104, good buddy. i'm gone.  you know you just scored some big man points in my book for that.  woohoo.  you just lost them again.  perry the platypus, don't start anything because i'm driving and it's really unsafe.  quit goofing around and sit down.  besides, you should really have your seatbelts on.  yeah. ah, you're probably wondering what i'm doing driving this big rig.  as you know, every inator of mine has a selfdestruct feature, all of which rely on a little formula top scientists refer to as "boom juice." i found a cheap deal on a whole truckload of the stuff out here in the sticks.  but i had to drive it home myself because well, the shipment's a little old and unstable.   oh, pay no attention to that.  that's just the mandatory early warning explosion alert.  i'll just turn down the sound so we can talk.  then i can tell you some of my truck driving tales.  ready.  mom, phineas and ferb. bust. look.  man: and one little orphan boy looked up at me with tears in his eyes and he said, "mr. trucker man, you done saved christmas." oh, that's good.  mom, bust boys.  oh, lawrence, look.  candace is sleepbusting again.  oh, that's adorable.  hon, go back to your nap now. go on.  mom, bust boys.  oh, go on. play track three.  it's the one where a group of truckers take down a corrupt police force using only their trucks and their saucy colloquialisms.  delivery.  hey, aren't you two a little young to be receiving a seasoned grill, 300 pounds of coffee, 200 pounds of fatback, four tons of lumber and assorted wheat, rye and pumpernickel breads.  think about it. age really isn't the issue here, right.  you got a point, kid.  so, then i say to him, "that's not a penguin.  it's a throw pillow." and so he throws it at me.  turns out it was a penguin and its beak went right into my mouth.  and i'm all, "ew. their beak is their nose." ugh. true story.  ah.   perry the platypus, i can't fight you and drive at the same time.  it's a good thing i installed my hitcharideinator.  aha. voila. we are locked together.  they do all the driving and i don't have to.  now, where were we. wait. hey. where did you go.  ow. ow. ow. no. no. hey. hey, what the heck, man.  oh. my word, there's a truckdriving pharmacist and he's pressing his face up against his windshield.  oh, that's what i love about you americans.  you're like big, fun children.  yes, yes, we are.  well, how about that. did you ever notice that the hood ornament here is a little dog.  hmm.  right there. red barn. bingo.  mom, have you seen phineas and ferb.  oh, honey, you're still sleepbusting.  go back and lie down, candace.  but the boys. go on. you're sleeping.  phineas. ferb.
