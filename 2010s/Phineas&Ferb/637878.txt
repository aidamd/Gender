"i see it." right on cue.  wait, what. come again.  i see it.  you mean you see my point.  no, candace.  i see that.  you do.   how could i miss it.  but i don't understand.  how the....  or who the....  bwhat the....  hi, mom.  check it out.  "the flying car of the future... today".  is that my car.  she sees the car, too.  the "flying car of the future... today" is still pulling a bit to the right.  phineas. ferb.  get down here this instant.  ok, mom, be right down.  oh, there you are, perry.  so, what do you think, mom.  pretty cool, huh.  cool.  this is the most dangerous thing i've ever seen.  don't worry, we were safe.  ferb invented a new invisible helmet head system.  "when life's never dull, wear a hull for your skull." how dare you do all this without permission.  but all our building permits are in order.  i meanmypermission.  this morning i asked you if we could modify our car to make it fly.  i was talking about your toy car.  how could you possibly think i meant my station wagon.  you are in so much trouble, young man.  but... we do this sort of thing every day.  what..  see, mom.  i told you...  but you never listened.  but i...  mom, phineas and ferb built a rollercoaster.  phineas and ferb are onehit wonders.  phineas and ferb carved my face into mount rushmore.  phineas and ferb are driving cattle.  phineas and ferb built a giant tree house robot...  ...are promoting a boxing match...  ...built a beach in the backyard...  ...built a time machine...  ...built a ski resort.  ...are directing a movie...  ...built a haunted house...  ...built a giant sundae maker...  ...are getting the band back together...  phineas and ferb are in my large intestine.  oh, candace. all the times i called you delusional and mocked you to my friends behind your back, all those journals i've filled with an eye towards standup comedy...  but you were telling the truth.  i'm so sorry.  you're the best daughter any mother could dream of having.  finally, you realize that.  well, what's all this yelling about.  oh, my word.  that is impressive.  did you know about this.  well, ii... ii, uh...  no.  what are you gonna do to them.  no tv for a month.  or they have to serve me for a year.  how about confiscating their toolbox.  i know.  take away their seats on the city council.  you have seats on the city council.  we rotate out with the board of selectmen.  well, some punishment may be in order, but, look, there's no harm done really.  hey, look, ferb, here's bolt number 473.  i hope that wasn't important.  well, at least the selfparking works.  heeheeheeheehee.  i'm sorry, but this is really for your own good.  we need you both to understand that what you've been doing is way too dangerous.  i'd never be able to live with myself if you got hurt.  we were wearing helmets.  don't worry. your boys will be in good hands.  as you can see from our realistically illustrated brochure, the smile away reformatory offers a serene, peaceful environment in which safety, discipline and responsibility are encouraged.  your boys will be whipped into shape in no time.  well, i'll be honest, ferb.  i didn't see this coming.  baljeet.  what are you doing here.  well, i got kicked out of summer school because my grades were too high.  but then i heard about this place.  sure, they break you down and strip you of your identity, but school is school.  bye, boys. see you at the end of summer.  yes. i actually busted phineas and ferb.  this is the happiest moment of my life.  whoohoo.  i'm finally free.   . the sun is up, the sky is blue . i can do whatever i want to . 'cause there's nothing in my way.  . my new life starts today . i used to fret and worry so . now i never felt so free . 'cause i'm makin' a good life . makin' a good life . it's the life for me . yeah, i'm makin' a good life, the life for me.  . yeah, i'm makin' a good life, the life for me .  that doesn't look like the brochure.  blah.  i was too excited to wait.  i shaved last night.  just call me baldjeet.  hehheh. get it.  baldjeet.  ok, listen up, maggots.  you are here because your parents are worried about you.  now, the way i see it, the root of all children's problems is unacceptable levels of imagination, fun, creativity and unbridled enthusiasm.  don't you eyeball me.  our goal at this school is to crush the dangerous elements inside you and replace them with structure, order, discipline and conformity.   what...  whatcha doin'.  oh, a few simple modifications.  we call it the "ferris bed." it makes trading off fair, simple and fun...   ...as well as giving easy access to the top bunk.  all at the push of a button.  pretty cool, huh.  you know, this is a very inefficient way to clean a bathroom.  that's the idea.  now, make it shine.   and no funky rhythms.  i thought it had more of a freeform jazz vibe.  huh.  well, you can't please everybody.  oh. owow.  what did you do.  i tripped over ferb's old toolbox.  well, do you wanna go horseback riding.  what's your hurry.  let's relax for a little while.  you know, with phineas and ferb gone, i've had a blast doing things i wanted to do.  but it's strange.  i kind of miss the little guys.  it's as if there was a whole other side to our relationship that i never noticed before.   . little brother . i remember when you first came home . then came another . little brother of our own . even when you break my toys . you will always be my...  . little brothers . 'cause you're younger . we're related and you're boys . even when you're making too much noise . you will always be my...  . little brothers 'cause your younger . we're related and you're boys . little brothers . little brothers . little brothers .  uh, stace, you're kind of bumming me out with the song there.  you know, you finally have everything you ever wanted.  call me when you get over it.  ok.  maybe a little tv will take my mind off things.  today on "the morty williams show," "my kid is bad, and i want to blame others." we'll go inside the nation's toughest reformatory school, where freethinking children undergo complete personality reprogramming and have all the creativity and imagination sucked right out of them.  they are forced to think inside the box.  wait a second.  they don't belong in a place like that.  i know what i have to do.  hey, candace.  jeremy.  how did you get in here.  there's a huge gaping hole in the side of your house.  oh, yeah, well, phineas and ferb would've usually fixed that by now.  you wanna go horseback riding.  would you stop already with the horses.  jeremy. i know what i'm gonna do today.  i'm gonna bust my brothers...  didn't you already do that.  ...out.  bust my brothers out.  cool.  i always liked your brothers.  i'm coming with you.  you mean, like a date.  yeah. a weird sort of prisonbreak kind of date.   age inappropriate building is unsafe and irresponsible.  good boys don't make anything but their sisters happy.  creative acts are imitatible and dangerous.  using your imagination is morally wrong.  the book was so much better.  hmm. it's a letter from the board of selectmen.  the city council is proposing a millage to cover the overage from last quarter, and they need phineas and ferb's input.  perhaps we were a bit hard on them.  yeah, they really did believe they had permission.  i suppose it was all a big misunderstanding.  well, let's go get 'em, shall we.  we can take the "flying car of the future... today." weren't you supposed to get that changed back to normal.  yes, yes, but you must admit, it's pretty cool.  yeah, it's pretty cool.  hey. where's the "flying car of the future... today".  aah.  sorry. the "flying car of the future... today" is pulling a bit to the right.  are you kidding.  this is the best day ever.   whoaoaoa.  maybe we should walk the rest of the way.  . i woke up this morning, and the world was gray . hadn't seen the sun since they hauled me away . the boss man says there's no use in tryin' . he won't let me color outside of the lines . got these chains on me . and they're draggin' me down . got these chains on me hear that clankin' sound.  on me mister, hear my song . don't say imagination is morally wrong . mmhmm . drink of water, boss.   . as long as i've been here . i got nothin' to show . try to make somethin', but the boss says no . wanna be creative but the man won't hear it . that big boss man, he's tryin' to crush my spirit . got these chains on me they won't let me fly . got these chains on me won't tell me why . got these chains on me mister, hear my song . don't say imagination is morally wrong . no, they won't let us dance or bang that gong . 'cause they say imagination is morally wrong .  hey, ferb, i know what we're gonna do today.  no.  hey, ferb, i know what we're... gonna do today.  no.  hey... ferb...  no... no...  i... uh... know...  no... no... no...  what...  no... no... no... no.   hey, ffff....   yes.  i've finally broken them.  you okay, candace.  no, i'm trudging.  i never knew people actually trudged.  look, we're here.  what doyouwant.  um... uh, hi.  yeah, i'm here for my brothers, phineas and ferb.  they don't graduate till the end of the summer.  get lost.  so much for the direct approach.  it's time we tried it phineas and ferb style.  is this gonna work.  it's just like the trojan horse from history class.  they'll accept this as a gift, then after everyone falls asleep, we'll jump out and rescue phineas and ferb.  you two again.  i thought i told you to get lost.  maybe we gotta think bigger.  wow, what a thoughtful gift.  too bad i don't have room for you, handsome.  i'm gonna have to get a bigger yard.   now's our chance.  yes. we did ioh, what is this, hair.  gross. )
