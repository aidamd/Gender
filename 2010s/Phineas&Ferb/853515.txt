 and leave it at that.  lschtump, jumping from the high dive was an important rite of passage.  are you a man or a schnitzel.  i'm a man, i'm a man.    heinz: with all those people looking and laughing at me, i just couldn't do it.   after that, my father and i became increasingly distant.   now, i will conquer my fear and jump from the high dive.  but you know, i still don't want any of these people to look at me and make fun of me.  so i invented the lookawayinator.  you'd think it would attract a lot of attention at a public pool, but so far no one's noticed it.  it must be leaking or something.   anyway, when i do my man making dive, you can bet that nobody in the tristate area will be looking.  sure, it will be tough for people who happen to be driving, plus brain surgeons might have a problem, too.  but it's really a small price to pay for me becoming a man, right.  you're right. i got to trap you.  romance. la, la, la, la, la.  is a jeremy bedroom.  omg.   mom, phineas and ferb made me.  um, i've got some stretch marks that would say otherwise.  no, i mean, they've split me in half.  well, not like i'm cut in half, but they've made another me.  hear for yourself. it's for you.  hi, jeremy.  not jeremy, it's mom.  oh, hi, mom. here's candace.  see.  mom: that was a very nice imitation of yourself, candace.  love you. bye.  no, wait. hello.  hey,

what say, we fire up the old molecular splitter and reverse...  forget it. i've only got one thing on my mind, and that's busting you.  i'm going to the mall to get mom.  wait for me.  well, i guess i know what we're gonna do today.  got to find mom.  got to find jeremy.  . me, myself and i don't see eye to eye . me, myself and i don't get along . me, myself and i can finally say goodbye . this collaboration always felt so wrong . there's two of us on a scene . and i don't wanna sound mean . but i'll tell you that i'm happy without me . i've been holding me back . but now i'm on my own track . we're done . the kids are all free . from here on out . we can both exist peacefully . without all of this trouble . and internal strife . internal strife . now that we're separate . we can do

tell me.  find candace, find mom. bust, bust, bust.  hi, jeremy.  uh, hey, candace. you have a flower in your hair.   i know.  okay, you're kinda scaring me.   i could just stare at you all day long.  listen, i gotta get back to work, but if you like, i can swing by your house after i'm done.  really. i would love that.  okay then, i'll see you after work.  something to remember me by.  okay.  okay, maybe later.  phineas: hey, jeremy. hey, guys.  have you seen candace.  yeah, she was just here.  was she talking about busting or was she ogling over you.  uh, both. she said something about going to find the other candace and mom, and then she went all wild when i mentioned stopping by tonight.  great. so if we just find mom, we'll find both candace's.  uh, tell them i say hi.  mister, come on. it's your turn.  are you some kind of a schnitzel.  i'm a man. not a schnitzel. i will prove it right now.   nobody calls me a schnitzel anymore.  i bet he doesn't even know what it means,

let's go.  how about you kids.  don't worry. we'll be home soon.  one candace down, one to go.  phineas. ferb. have you seen the other candace.  we just saw her. she's driving away with mom.   if the molecular splitter doesn't just disappear when this is over, we should really consider destroying it.  agreed.  my jeremy, my jeremy, my jeremy and i will be forever.  my jeremy, jeremy, jeremy will leave me never.  ooh, jeremy. yay, jeremy.   what was that noise.  jeremy's coming. gotta get ready for jeremy.   where is she.  where is who.  candace. she was with you in the car.  yes, she was...

there were more people here.  what did you want, candace.   nothing.  suit yourself.  . i want to sing .   i try so hard to keep you under wraps.  i can't do anything right, even with two of me.  i can't bust my brothers. i can't even...  there you are, candace.  jeremy.  your mom said you got this picture frame for me at the mall today.  uh, no, i mean, that wasn't really me. i mean...  not all

                   okay, boys, i'm off to the store for as much mucus be gone as i can carry.  are you sure you're going to be okay.  no worries, mom. we'll be perfectly fine.  well, all right. bye.  both: bye, mom.  aw, you guys really are sick.  oh, you know us.   nothing can ever keep us down.  that's great. you're completely incapacitated.  that means i have the whole day to myself.  i could spend all day on my jeremy scrapbook, or i can work on jeremy, the board game.  or i could go to the mall and watch jeremy work from my hiding place behind the weave and wig.  the possibilitiesare endless.  this is gonna be the best sick day ever, for me.  best sick day ever, huh.  ferb, i know we're gonna...   all right, ferb, implement our sick day video game backup system.  ready local area network.  whatcha doing.   you too, huh.  where's everyone else.  here we are. here we are.   so everyone's sick in bed today, huh.  nah, i'm just lazy.  cool, i think. hey, where's perry.  agent p, i didn't know you were a germaphobe.  corro is afraid of germs just like you.  corro: it's not the germs, sir, it's the garlic smell.  if you have something to say, corro, spit it out.  corro: uh, never mind, sir.  anyway, doofenshmirtz has been seen racking up huge bills in brain, bath and beyond, the area's largest big box mind control warehouse store.  get to the bottom of it. monogram out.  heinz: ah, perry the platypus. i've been expecting you.  sit anywhere, perry the platypus. make yourself at home.   so what do you think of my devolitionator.  not to be confused with my deevolutionator from a few schemes ago.  you see, volition is our ability to choose what we are going to do.  whereas evolution...  it's got something to do with monkeys, i think.  but this allows me to take over your volition and control what you do.  like this, watch.  how do you feel, perry the platypus.   well, it doesn't matter because i'm in control.  okay, turn, and let's go outside and see what this baby can really do.  and let's make this snappy. i gotta pick up my daughter by 5:00.  you remember vanessa, right.  you know, you blew me up at her birthday party.  all right, gang, who's wants to go first.  i want to. me. me.  let's let the computer decide.  electronic voice: buford vs. isabella.  i'm fighting a girl. this will be easy.  ooh.  electronic voice: fightuh.  patch sash smack attack.  isabella winsuh.  in your face, buford.  . doofenshmirtz's exwife's sports sedan .  thanks for driving me to the scrap yard invasion party, mom.  now remember, i won't be able to pick you up afterwards 'cause i'm gonna be getting my nails done.  so, i have your dad picking you up.  oh, that's cool.  if by cool you mean completely embarrassing me in front of the only people whose opinions matter to me.  at least he's trying.  yes, very trying.  do you remember the last time he picked me up.  heinz: vanessa, over here.  hop in.   uh, don't ask.  maybe you should just let me off here.  at least i can start the party off with my dignity intact.  whoops, too late.  look, it's the only people whose opinions matter to you.  hey, johnny.  hey, vanessa. nice ride.  yeah, hold on to that thought. my dad's picking me up.  have fun at the dump. watch out for medical waste.  all right, gang, let's see who's next.  electronic voice: baljeet vs. ferb.  oh, great, it is not like ferb is an internationally ranked video game wizard or anything.   electronic voice: fightuh.  baljeet winsuh.  ferb, did you let me win to save my fragile, nerdy ego.  oh, i'd never do that.   look at all the freaks here.  i know, huh. our peeps. and look at this.  we're on the internet. what.  this whole place is wired. they've got cameras everywhere.  there's like dozens of live feeds.  here's the crowd dancing. the dj. here's the restroom.  not cool, man.  wow, this is like the coolest midday scrap yard raid ever.  okay, isabella and baljeet won their battles.  so who am i gonna battle.  electronic voice: phineas vs. phineas.  okay. at least i'm evenly matched.  electronic voice: fightuh.  phineas winsuh.  i'm kicking my own butt.  left foot, right foot. left foot, right foot.  okay, now, skip.   i'm controlling perry the platypus.  and, uh, slap yourself.   why are you hitting yourself.  why are you hitting yourself.  why are you hitting yourself.  why are you hitting yourself.   i can make you do anything.   uhoh.  eat that gum off the sidewalk.  oh, gross. you're really going to do it, perry the platypus.  that's so unsanitary.  didn't your mother ever tell you not to do that.  ooh. oh, it looks so horrible. i can't look.  i can't look.  stop, stop, perry the platypus, stop.   oh, man, that was great.  now put it back down and do it again.  awesome place for a dance party, huh.  yeah, i just saw a rat.    it's my dad.  yes, dad.  heinz: perry the platypus almost ate gum off the sidewalk.  is that what you called to tell me.  no, no, i just called to remind you that i'll be picking you and your visigoth friends up after the dance.  dad, it's goths, not visigoths.  and they're punks, not goths.  ah, sorry, elrik, i thought they were visigoths, but you're not going to impress the punks.  you're free to go.  but i still get my day raise.  see, this is what it's like having a teenage daughter, you're never cool enough.  anyway, why are you hitting yourself.  why are you hitting yourself.  why are you hitting yourself.  perry the platypus, i can't believe you removed the shopping cart from the supermarket parking lot.  you must be feeling so evil.   oh, look at the time. i've got to go pick up vanessa.  mush, perry the platypus. mush.  a junk yard.  why can't they have the party in a nice place, like the caribou lodge.  you ever been to the caribou lodge, perry the platypus.  they have a nice spread there.  sweet ride, dude.  heinz: thank you. platypus power.   uhoh.  batteries are low. hmm.  take five, perry the platypus.   that was...   uhoh, power surge.  no, wait. ooh, a perry level. nice graphics.  okay, perry the platypus, all charged up and ready to...  oh, great. now what's wrong with it.  i didn't do that.  i did that. but i only seem to have control of his left arm.  let me try. cool. i've got control of his left leg.  i've got his right arm.  why are you hitting yourself.  why are you hitting yourself.  why are you hitting yourself.  ferb's got right leg.  oh, i have got back and forth.  what's wrong with him. stop that. stop it.  what is the goal of this game.  i'm not sure.  who cares. let's just fight that old pharmacist.  sure. this must be the boss level.  all right, guys, we work as a team on this one.  uhoh.  phineas: ready, stance, now taunt and jump.  great leap, leg team.  i bet those flies are power ups.  let's see.  ugh, perry the platypus. gross.  that's worse than sidewalk gum.  oh, yeah.  perry the platypus, what's gotten into you.  buford: he's trying to get away.  not on our watch.  now, now, perry the platypus.  eat pig iron, old pharmacist.  stay back, perry the platypus. back.  buford. i'm on it.  on my mark, guys.  baljeet, in. baljeet: roger.  wait. why are you moving so deliberately.  phineas: legs, jump, buford.  yeah, finish him off, ferb.  nice one.    we won, gang.  and if i may be so bold, i claim the right to throw perry's hat in the air.  huh, game over      dad.  that's your dad. no.  i was at the caribou lodge once and it was just like this.   dad, why.   who's up for charades.  perry the platypus, what are you doing down here.   dad.  oh, hi, vanessa.
