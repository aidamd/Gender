"happy birthday.  love, mom." ah.  aw, that's so sweet.  is today your birthday.  it is.  and george and i are going to celebrate.  huh.   i'm late for my appointment.  hold on to this for me, will

surprise party.  even better.   you know how i throw a party.  it's as easy as a, b, c, d.  all you need is a) an apartment, b) your buddies, c) a cake and d) decorations.  ah.  narrator: a, b, c, d.  that didn't sound hard at all.   uhoh.  the man with the yellow hat would be back at 7:00.  george had only four hours to get the party ready.  he already had an apartment.  ah. uhhuh.  and the man's buddies were listed in this book.  so that took care of a and b.  but george still needed c and da cake and decorations.  you want me to invite the people in his address book.  all of them.   okay.  seven.  oh, you mean 7:00.  got it.   chef pisghetti: since you invited me to your party, i'm gonna give you my special all fruit frozen cake on the house.  just pick a size, giorgio.  george: hmm.  a big party needed a big cake.  the big one.  surprise.   looks like quite a celebration.  is it a birthday.  yep. say, i could blow that up for you.  it'd make a great decoration.  ah. uhhuh.  just pick a size.  normal, huge or jumbo madness.   jumbo madness it is.      hmm.  hiya, george.  everyone's coming.  i just had to say "yellow hat," and they all said yes.  whew.  oh, i'll take that stuff upstairs.  maybe you want to get a stepladder to hang the star.  uhhuh, uhhuh.  hmm...  george thought the small ladder looked about right.  5:00. oh i got to get back to work.  hundley can stay, though.  see ya at the party.  bye.   oh...   george had picked too wide of a cake.  aah.  it wouldn't fit in the freezer.  luckily, it was cold out on the balcony.  that took care of c) cake.  now for d) decorations.  aw.  huh.     george had also picked too big of a poster.   and a toosmall ladder.  aah.   everything was the wrong sizetoo big, too wide, too small.  if only he lived in a world where everything was the right size...   ...george size.    huh.  oh. huh.   george had gotten his wish.  his apartment was the perfect size for a monkey.  now he just needed the cake and decorations.   the man's car was georgesized, too.  this was the best.    heya, george.  it was a georgesized world, but now the people were too big.   so how wide do you want this poster.  one, two or three georgeswide.  huh.  not only were things the right size for george, he was the size.  okay let me see...  this is, um, this is, um, one george, and...   this is, uh, this is two georges, and, of course, this is, um, this is three georges wide.  george knew it'd be easier to handle a poster that wasn't wider than he was.  man: great.  how are we gonna nail this to be three georgestall if you forgot the georgestick.  we don't need a stick.  there's george.  one george, two georges, three georges.  there, three georgestall.  thanks, george.   pick a cake.  any cake.  hmm.  you know, a one georgearm size is perfect for the average freezer.  ah.   cake, decorations...  it was all so easy with george measurements.  woman:  he's a monkey named george    got a friend with a hat    he's a furry brown fellow and we like him like that.   the cake was in the freezer, the poster was on the wall, and the star was no trouble at all.  george was ready for his guests.   aha.   hello, giorgio.  narrator: but not ready for their size.  i hope we're not too early.     ah. how you doing there. yeah.  this is going to be some party, huh.  george really set all this up.  it's really nice.    ah, i see you've got a twogeorgestall apartment.  and furniture to match.  very unique.  hey, hey, hey, he's coming.    george is right.  we have to hide.   shh.  is there a plant i can hide under.  woman: i can see you.  man: stig. stig.  hi, everybody.  all: surprise.  huh. a party.  for me.  uhhuh.  gee, ththanks.    sorry.   margaret: oh.  me, too.   stig: uh, uh, how about some music.  narrator: a georgesized apartment was fine for little monkeys, but not at all good for peoplesized people.     oh. huh.   this was more like it.  everything was the size it should be.   except maybe the cake.    6:00only an hour leftand george had to start over.  george wanted to get the sizes right, so he decided to measure everything first.   uhhuh.   uhhuh.  this time, george ordered the right size cake.  ah.  and poster.   and chose a better ladder.   george, are you home.  all: surprise.  what is this.  to celebrate my birthday.  oh, wow.  all my friends, and...  my plumber, my dentist, my barber.  they were in your address book.  george put everything together.  aw.  : he did.  oh, thank you, george.  narrator: maybe it wasn't so bad being a little monkey in a big world after all.  and there was one thing his arms were always the right size for.  child: george is a monkey.  he learned how to measure things to get the right size.  girl: today, we are measuring stuff.  we took a piece of yarn and measured her arm length.  boy: we're going to see if it's the same as her body length.  my prediction is that her arm length is going to be shorter than her body length.  prediction means when you take a guess at something.  it's kind of like the same length as your body.  my prediction was wrong.  i thought her arm length was going to be smaller than her body length.  we tracedourselves.  girl:my mom helped us.  boy: we made ourselves out of cardboard.  we're going to measure the bench with tias.  my prediction is four tias.  both: one.  two.  three.  girl: it came out to three, plus almost a full tia.  and her feet are sticking out.   narrator: george thought professor wiseman's beach housewas great.  this time, it was even greater because george had brought yorbo, the friendliest robot ever.   mechanical voice: searching. searching.  searching.  item found.  ah.  yorbo is great, yes.   narrator: yorbo's next job was to help george and the man with the yellow hat pack a lunch for the beach.  oh, no. not... look out.  huh.  man: oh. sorry, george.  i'm listening to an audio bookthe slimy sea monster from the sea.  it's great.  and scary.  ooh.  narrator: george didn't understand how something could be great and scary.  ah.   thanks.  uhhuh.   now, are you ready for a long hike to the beach.  uhhuh.  tadah.     i hope we don't run into any slimy sea monsters.   narrator: george couldn't think of a better way to spend the day than exploring the beach with yorbo.      keep items in here.  uhhuh.  man: say, george, you want to go swimming.   uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.  ooh. good idea.  sorry, yorbo.  robots can't swim.  could you read the manual again, please.   man: well, george, if yorbo was made of plastic like your bucket or wood like this chair, he could go in the water.  but yorbo is made of metal, which rusts when it gets wet.  and rust is very bad for metal, because it does this.  oh.  uhoh.   last monkey in is a rotten turnip.     i guess a storm is coming.   correctionthe storm is here.  quick, george, let's get inside.  whew. made it.    uh, okay.    narrator: george thought it would be fun to sit inside a cozy house and watch a storm with the man and... yorbo.   george, you can't go outside when there's thunder and lightning.   oh, yorbo is out there.   don't worry.  he'll get wet, but we'll clean and dry him before he has time to rust.  as soon as the storm quiets down, we'll go get him.    hey.  how about a game of tictactoe.   narrator: george usually really enjoyed tictactoe, but this time, he couldn't get his mind off yorbo.    huh.      huh.   man: wow.  the storm really did a number on the beach.  don't worry, george.  yorbo's a tough little robot.  we'll find him.      under the seaweed.  could be.   okay.  narrator: but yorbo wasn't under that seaweed.  or any of the seaweed.    okay.  so, we've searched on top of the sand and under the seaweed, which means...  yorbo must be buried in the sand.  ah.  uhhuh.  man:  i'm digging a hole    looking for a robot     i'm digging a hole, looking for a robot.     oh, wow.  i found gold.  whoa. or a cd player.  hey, that's mine.  i forgot all about it.  oh, wow, wasn't that a great storm.  you always find such great stuff after a storm, you know.  ooh...   nifty, huh.  it's a metal detector.  it helps you find buried metal.    you're right, george.  that could help us find yorbo.  what's a yorbo.  oh, he's a robot who got lost in the storm.  george's favorite toy.  oh, well, then you need this more than i do.   now, the louder it beeps, the closer you're getting to metal.  now, when it beeps like crazy.  bingo.  you have just made a monkey very happy.  narrator: using the detector, george found lots of metal things.      but none of them was yorbo.     oh, the batteries are dead.  i'll have to recharge them, but i'll bring this back tomorrow in case you're still looking.  bye now.  thank you.  oh, pfft.  narrator: george couldn't wait for tomorrow.  he had to find yorbo before he rusted.   that's probably professor wiseman.  maybe she can think of something.  hey, guys.  hi.  i heard there was a storm, so i thought i'd check in.   oh, what's wrong.  well, george can't find his robot.  it's buried in the sand.  hmm. is it made of metal.  uhhuh.  you could try using a metal detector.  we borrowed one, but it ran out of batteries.  well, metal detectors are easy to make.  huh.  sure.  first, grab the portable radio from the shelf.  okay. am/fm radio.  check.  next, find the calculator.  uh, bottom drawer on the desk.   then, get some tape.  uh, top drawer on the desk.   now take the radio and switch it to am.  okay.  then turn the knob all the way to the highest radio station number, but make sure you get static and not an actual station.  turn up the volume, then turn on the calculator and tape it to the radio.   fantastic.  you see, the radio and calculator act as a magnet.  when it finds things that would stick to a magnet, the radio beeps.   that's amazing.  i can't believe you knew that.  well, how do you think i won first place in my secondgrade science fair.  narrator: george was confused.  he had already searched half the beach...  but which half.  if only the beach were smaller.  then george remembered tictactoe.  he could break up the beach into smaller sections like a tictactoe board.  if george could mark off the squares he searched, then he'd know where he'd looked and where he needed to look.  ah.   hi, george.   you want to make a grid to help you keep track of your search.  uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.  oh, great idea, george.  all set.  let me know if you need anything.   narrator: if george searched every square, then he'd be sure to find yorbo.   huh.  in square number four, george found...  a trumpet.  in square six, george found...   oh...  ...a front grill to a '57 cadillac.  but by square number eight, there was still no sign of yorbo.  no luck, huh.  uhuh.  narrator: yorbo had to be in this last square.  hehadto.    oh, oh, oh.   aha.    way to go, george.  you found him.   yorbo is great. yes.  uhhuh.    have fun.   well, i guess this means i can get back to the thrilling conclusion of my book.   oh, well, wait for me.   girl: geor girl: george is a monkey.  he used a metal detector to find metal things in the sand.  boing.  we are cleaning the sandbox.  girl:while i was cleaning, i found a letter with a magnet on it, right here.  and then i saw that if you moved one magnet around, then you can find metal.  we're gonna use magnets to find stuff in the sandbox.  girl: this is like a metal detector that george used.  jacob just found a nut on a bolt.  it's the type of metal that does stick to a magnet.  some kinds of metal don't stick to magnets.  whoa.  now we're fishing with the magnets.  we're not catching fish.  we're catching metal.  girl: jacob caught a paintbrush.  the magnet stuck to the metal part.  we learned a lot about magnets and metal.  wednesday...  that hohum, stuck in the middle day.  wednesday:  anncr: until now.  wednesday: ah.  anncr: all this month, pbs kids is giving your mid week a
