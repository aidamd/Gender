a perfect day for boating.  anyone with a boator even withoutwas floating on the river.  george had never seen so many different boats in his life.  ooh...  and then he saw a boat that wasn't like any he'd ever seen beforea boat full of cars.   oh, that's... that's a ferryboat.  it carries people in cars across the river.  george loved cars.  but cars and boats together.  it was the apple pie and ice cream of transportation.  renkins : ahoy.  today's our annual model boat show.  big prizes for little boats.  bill: george.  over here.  what do you think of her, george.  sailors call boats "her." i bet a city kid like you never knew that.   yeah.  you made that, bill.  yes, sir.  well, that is pretty impressive, isn't it, george.   aw, thanks.  but it's nothing compared to mr. quint's model whaling boat.  that's it over there.  draw the nets, laddies.  aye, aye, cap'n.  and over there is mrs. renkins' ark.    and look at all those over there.  it's some pretty tough competition this year.  now, don't underestimate yourself, bill.  that is one finelooking boat.  good luck.   oh, sure, you can stay with bill.  i'll set you up right here.  okay, i'll be over at the bleachers saving up some seats and sizing up bill's competition.  i'd sure like to win a ribbon, george.  to buy this kit, i had to save nine weeks of money from my paper route.  agh.  i almost forgot to do my paper route.  could you do me a big favor and watch my boat while i'm gone.   see ya soon.   george knew boat watching was serious business.  there were a lot of nice boats here, but not one person had built the greatest boata ferryboat.  maybe he could build one.   commanding a ferry had been george's lifelong dream, ever since he first heard of themearlier that morning.  oohooh...  luckily, bill's boat looked good as new.   maybe he just put it down the wrong way.   hey, george, how's it going.   i'll be back after i deliver the rest of these papers.  thanks for taking good care of my boat.   george couldn't figure out what he'd done to it.  it looked perfect.  but he knew one thing...  : no....  bill couldn't enter the contest with this boat.   george had to build him a new one, and fast.  unfortunately, george had no idea how to do that.   first, george had to find out what boats were made of.  if you've gotta build a boat in a hurry, a bucket of toys is a handy thing to have.  hmm...   jumpy squirrel's new favorite thing to do was watch george sink boats.  and he wasn't disappointed.   it turned out, metal didn't float so well.  especially when it was full of holes.  plastic.  plastic might work.  just like the other toy boat.  aha.  : oh.  but metal cars are heavy.  even so, it was sort of floating, it was just sort of floating underwater.  bill: hey, george.  see ya soon.  i'm almost done.   george had three greatlooking boats.  but just looking boaty didn't make them float.   at last, george had something he knew would float.  bill wasn't going to win any contests with a tiny board.   no....  and this is what he had to work with.  oh...  maybe it was time to study boats in action.  wide boats seemed to work well.   steam coming out...   a propeller...   and a good solid bottom.   okay, a wide boat...  with steam coming out...  and a propeller.  all done.  i'm just gonna drop my bike at home.  would you mind watching my boat for a few more minutes.     bill: newspaper delivery is an exact business.  people expect it at the same time every day.   thanks for watching my boat.  whereismy boat.  george.  you built this yourself.  mmhmm.  wow. i thought city kids just bought everything.  where'd you say my boat was.  uhoh.  uh... heh...  holy cow...   you did me a real favor, george.  huh.  i forgot to close the windows.  thanks for showing me.  i would've really been sunk if it happened in the contest.  model boating requires utmost attention to tiny detailsand keeping the water out.  come on, let's go enter.  hey, you gotta bring your boat to enter it.  huh.   sure. who else has a boat like that.  let's hear it for our winners.   congratulations, george.  i didn't even know you built a boat.  i convinced him to enter it and...  did you see this.  it says "best boat by a monkey."  that's funny.  they must have run out of regular ribbons.  i'll take care of this.  i'll ask 'em to make you one that says, "best boat by a city kid."  kid 1: george is a monkey and he can do things you can't do.  kid 2: i really like the boat he built, and we're gonna make some, too.  because we have all kinds of cool stuff to make boats with.  i'm using a pie pan, a cup, a paper towel roll.  i think it will float.  i'm using some straws and a cup.  i think it's gonna float.  this boat is gonna float, but if it doesn't float, it's okay.  i think it's gonna sink.  the straws are filling with water and then the water weighs it down.  if it got water in the front, it's gonna sink.  mine's sinking down to the bottom.  cool.  we can make boats float...  and sink.   narrator: to george it was a perfect morningeating and reading and having nothing better to do.  but there was one thing he was supposed to do.  george.  didn't you promise to clean up this room yesterday.   you can't leave toys lying around.  someone could get hurt.  whoa.   lucky for me this wall was here.  now please clean up, george.  when i come home from work we'll spend the evening in our nice, clean living room, okay.   zoom.  rolling on the car looked funexcept for the slamming into the wall part.   whee.  if one car was fun, imagine what you could do with two.  george had to show his great new carshoes to someone.   george couldn't wait to see the look on hundley's face.   that wasn't the look he expected.    hundley didn't want monkey handprints all over the clean doors.   whoa.  george didn't know how to turn around and go back.  i don't know, we have too many roller skates.  now, what can we do to make people more interested in skates.  well, how about having a rollerskating monkey give demonstrations.  and just where are we going to find a rollerskating monkey.  the skates are our gift to you.  you just skate in front of the store whenever you can.  okay.  you better give him another pair, hon.  he's got four feet.  i thought he had four hands, but fine, two pairs it is.  okay, let's, uh...  let's see what you can do.     maybe he should practice outside.  yeah. gotcha.  now, you practice, little mister, then come back.  okay.  do you ever think we'll see him again.  if you can't trust a monkey, who can you trust.  george liked his new skates...  but what were these black things for.    george thought that even hundley would have to admire his skatesespecially since now he knew how to stop.   huh.  whoa, uh, let me help you with those.  uh, hundley, you're in charge.   huh.      a monkey on wheels looked wrong, but a proud, sleek dachshund on nice wheels...   george knew exactly what hundley wanted to do.    whee.    check out the cool wiener dog on roller skates.  it occurred to george that perhaps he should have shown hundleyhow to stop.          the only thing in the world hundley wanted was to stop rolling.    now the only thing in the world he wanted was for these nice girls to take the wheel shoes off him.  but unfortunately, the girls didn't speak dachshund.  i think he's sad because we messed up his ride.  don't worry, doggy, we'll get you rolling again.   ready.  one, two...  three.     george thought he recognized that tail racing toward him.   but it couldn't be hundley.  hundley would never go that fast.  how many rollerskating wiener dogs could there be in the city.      ah.  oh.     it was over.  hundley was sorry he'd tried these wheel shoes on, and never wanted to see them again.  hm.  a dog on skates.  what a talented little guy you must be.  andsohandsome.  then again, he did look good on those wheel shoes.  with a little practice, he could be the talk of the town.  good dog. mmm...  hmm.   ahh.          hundley could think of nothing worse than skating down the sidewalk out of control with a cat on his back, until...  whoa. that cat's skateboard is, like, made of dog.  gnocchi realized that when the boy leaned, he could steer.  so, maybe she should try it.      huh.   ooh.  huh.  george thought he recognized that flying dog.  but it couldn't be hundley.  hundley wouldn't fly.  then again, how many skating, flying wiener dog and cat teams could there be in the city.     hey.     george thought this was a good time to show hundley how to stop.        no matter what george did, they kept going faster and faster.   he couldn't imagine how they were ever going to stop.   then he could.   hundley, i've been worried.  where have youyou are a muddy mess.  ooh, looks like he's not the only one.   we can't have the tenants see us like this, hundley.  i'll get a towel and get you cleaned up, boy.  time for you to clean up, too, george.  aww.   hey, wait a minute.   george.  hundley was sure if that monkey and cat hadn't been around he could have learned to skate.  say, weren't there two pairs of skates.  must have been my imagination.  hmm.  child: well, he's a monkey, and sometimes he does things that you can't do.  child 2: george and his friends rolled down the hill really fast.  we are going to roll some things, too.  girl: we are going to roll these down and see which one's the farthest.  this is my ball. it's kind of light.  oh, my... oh.  child: this is my ball.  it's much smaller.  oh.  boy: this is an oversized tennis ball.  go.  girl: this is my ball, andit's much heavier and larger.  boy: yours rolled the farthest.  she has the heaviest ball.  and that makes it go longer.  girl: the biggest ball would go much farther than the littlest.  hola.  i have a really fun game we can play called animale.  " what animal goes moooo.  a cow. a cow.
