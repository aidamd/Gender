catch a nap when the lobby is peaceful...   ...but when george lives in your building...  guarding against monkey mishaps is always more important than sleep.  good morning.  headed out to have fun.  no. going to dr. baker for my annual checkup.  right on time as usual.  well, didn't you bring....   george. hello.  have a seat in the waiting room, i'll call you when the doctor's ready.  george learned that the thing you need most in a doctor's waiting room is patience.   huh.  a mysterious sound.  george listened as quietly as he could.  doctor baker will see you now.  oh great. come on, george.  we're finally getting out of the waiting room.     george gave up hope of hearing any mystery sound past that sneezing.  i'm still waiting for dr. gezond.  well, i'm sure he'll be right with you.  excuse me, has dr. gezond seen you yet.  no. where is he.  he should be right with you.   you're waiting for dr. gezond, too.   he should be right with you.  oh, hi, doctor. you remember george.  : how could i forget.  before your last checkup, i never knew the xray machine fit out the window.   dr. baker, have you seen dr. gezond.  his patients are waiting.  hmm... no.  you should check the xray room.  and you should take off your shirt for the examination.  yeah, sure, doc.  george thought he'd like to be a doctor, because dr. baker seemed so smart.  and he got to wear a really great white coat.  okay, let's get started.  up on the scale.  whoa, i think you need to cut out the desserts.  you've gained some weight.  at. i have maybe one doughnut a month.  i run marathons.  it's impossible.   ah, same as last year.  whew.  this is how i check his reflexes, george.  ooh.  um, my knee's starting to get sore.  oh, sorry.  i never get to play with a monkey.  dr. gezond....  ah...  ah...  okay, take a long deep breath.   i don't like the sound of that breathing.  no, george was...  whoa.   ever used a stethoscope, george.  huh.  i use it to hear things that i can't see.     that's the sound of my heart.     ooh.   you can play with your heart while we go to the xray room.    not everything had a heartbeat.   but george found sounds he hadn't noticed with his bare ears.    a doctor coat just didn't sound the same without a doctor in it.  before he was just a young monkey with a stethoscope.  now he was george m.d., monkey doctor.   dr. george had just the tool he needed to track down that mysterious "bloopy" sound.   dr. gezond.  she made a lot of noise.  maybe she was emitting some "bloopy" sounds.  you're not dr. gezond.  are you really a doctor.  aha.   i've been waiting so long, i don't even care.   i have this terrible...  ...sneeze.  it goes away and comes back and goes away.     the sweater was muffling the sounds inside.  there was one way to fix that.   huh.  should i keep breathing.  it might help if i take this off.   i'm cured.  you're a genius, monkey... dr. monkey.   oh, i'm not cured.   i'm allergic to this sweater.  you're the best doctor i've ever had.  and i'm not just saying that because you're a monkey.  george had cured his first patient.  but then...   man: doctor, is that you.  a doctor never ignores a patient in need.  hey, you're a monkey.  aah.  my problem is my arm, not my throat.  i'll wait for dr. gezond, because you're a monkey.   did you hear that weird noise, too.  what is that.  shh.    i've had the hiccups  for two weeks.  i can't  stop.  well, aren't you going to  help me.  what kind of  monkey doctor  are you.  shh.  that's him.  that's the monkey that tried to make me go "ahh."  he's a genius monkey doctor.  he discovered my allergy.  george, do you have permission to be a doctor.  shh.   what's going on out here.  george, what are you wearing.  you haven't performed any operations, have you.  shh.   what was that.  you don't know.  i figured it was your medical machinery.  shh.   aha.   dr. gezond.  oh. oh. hello.  i... i came in here during my break to play just one round.  i must have lost track of time.   nothing feels as great as monkey curiosity satisfied.  oh, my. my hiccups are cured.   george liked the stethoscope and doctor coat so much that dr. baker let him keep them.   and though hundley was grateful the lobby was peaceful, he started to worry that, someday, george might really be his doctor.  girl: george is a monkey, so he can do things that you can't do.  boy: he was being a doctor and listening to everything with a stethoscope.  boy 2: today, we are at the angell animal medical center.  it's an animal hospital.  i'm dr. nancy laste.  we are listening to hearts today.  does anyone know what the heart does.  it pumps out a lot of blood. excellent.  girl: we used a doppler to see how the heart sounds like.   it sounds like a thunderstorm.  i agree.  what we are hearing here is actually the blood kind of rushing by.   girl 2: the kitten's heart was super fast, like...   laste: the smaller the animal, the faster the heart rates.  and the larger the animal, the slower the heart rates.   dog heart's kind of slow.  boy 2: i think that the dog is, like, older so the heart doesn't beat that much.  so i'm going to give you guys some stethoscopes, and these are instruments that help us listen to the heart better.  put these in your ears.  now you hear it.  boy 2: it sounds like boom, boom.  boom, boom.  girl 2: we learned how the hearts go faster and slower and also medium.   the day started with a wham, wham, wham.  lots of people heard it, but only one was so curious he had to go see what it was.  wow. pretty impressive construction site, huh, george.  that's what it will looklike when they're all done.  my hat.  stop. my hat. anybody.    these metal boxes looked important.  metal on the outside...  tasty sandwich inside.  with all this great equipment to see, george didn't want to waste time on food.   machinery is more fun when it's nice and loud.   now, you see. there it goes again.  why is my building groaning and quaking.  i think the ground under the foundation is shifting, but i can't figure out where or why.  i want this place to be safe.  we'll have to shut the site down until we find the problem.  george.  george, get down.  that's not a playground.  hey, buddy, this your monkey.  and is this your cat.   no. but, i...  oh, not good, cat.   well, looks like lunch is on me.  the next morning, the man with the yellow hat was doing a little constructing of his own.  good morning, george.  what will it be for breakfast.  waffles or pancakes.  wafflesandpancakes it is.  sorry, george, but there are no blueberries.  we'll just find something else fun to put on top.   or you could go down to the store and buy blueberries.  okay, george, this is a ten.  so be very...   careful.   george suddenly realized something was missing.  no wham, wham, wham.  maybe they were done.  oh...  the building was built.  the blueberries would have to wait.  the building wasn't done.  but no one was working today. aw...   huh.   maybe this was a perfect time to look around without distracting anybody.     how would he pay for the blueberries.   george was definitely going to give compass blueberries for his help.   huh.      hah.    waah.      oh...   the money was ripped, but at least george had both halves.     compass was a homing pigeon.  what george needed was a retriever.     no one wanted to go in there.  maybe there was another way.           oh...    there was no way george's arm could ever reach the bottom of that hole.  oh.  hi. have you seen george.  i sent him to the store a while ago, and...  store. i saw him running past the store down the street.  oh. the construction site's that way.  i hope he's being a good little monkey.   this wasn't as easy as it looked.  grunting) aha.    aha.     aw...  there had to be a machine for this.  hmm.      haha.  i inspected every girder last night, and i can't find the problem.  the only way to be safe is to tear it down and start all over.  otherwise, a big wind or strong shaking might make the whole thing fall down.   what's that sound.  hey, hey, hey, stop that.  the site's closed.  aha.  huh.  this site isn't safe.  i'll turn off that jackhammer.  : look. a broken water main.  that's what weakened the foundation.  it was hidden.   run away.    oh, i hope george had nothing to do...   ...with this.  hmm.  man:i am so sorry.  i didn't know one monkey could knock over a building.  can i pay for... lunch.  no, george didn't cause that.  that side of the building was unsafe.  now i'll have to knock it down and start all over.  no, you don't.  we can save the whole thing by changing the design.  hmm. very angular, modern...  andit would save money.  i love it.  how can i thank you.  : i know.  here.    well, what are we waiting for.  we'll bring back blueberry waffles for everyone.   and that's how curious george helped design a building...  and got blueberry waffles, too.  girl: george is a monkey, so he can boy: george is a monkey, so he can do things you can't do.  boy 2: he did not know how to use the tools and the machines.  boy: today we went to eliza's house to see the construction.  my name is justin kelley.  hello. i'm the contractor on the job.  now we're going to do a walkthrough of the house.  keep an eye on the way that all the workers are protecting themselves with gloves and masks.  we're actually starting to restore some of the woodwork and we're using a combination of hand sanding as well as power sanding.  we'd like to remove this paint right here.  now would you like to try the power sander.   all right.  boy: i took off less paint using my handand i took off more paint using the machine.  man: we're going to use a machine to remove the paint.  for safety reasons you t to put on a respirator just to protect your lungs and also safety goggles to protect your eyes.   so, what do you think of that, folks.  when it rotates right around, it's grinding it right off and then it sucks it up right here into the vacuum.  girl: the vacuum sucks up all the old paint.  try pulling out a nail with this.  i can't do it.  the hammer is about 12 inches long, the crow bar is about 30 inches long which will give you more leverage.  boy: curious george should learn how to use tools like we did.  lly chattering) for more fun with curious george and his friends, visit your
