that poppin' beat.    george liked popping beats, too.   popcorn.  oh, good idea.  man: ow. owowowowow.  i'm howlin' hal, continuing with our bonnie smooth marathon.  i love bonnie smooth.  yeah. uhhuh.  and for all you bonnie smooth lovers out there, now's your chance to win two free tickets  to bonnie's concert tonight.  both: huh.  just be the first caller to tell me: what is bonnie's favorite snack.  oh. you make the popcorn, i'll make the call.  uhhuh.  there's nothing a monkey likes better than pushing buttons.  huh.  oh.   george : oh...  you have to push the buttons in the right order, remember.  uhhuh.  oh.  push the timer.  it's the button with the clock on it.   then push 200 for two minutes.  uh, uh, uh.   got it.  then push the green triangle to start.   howlin' hal: hello, caller.  so, what's bonnie smooth's favorite snack.  raisins.  come on down and get your front row tickets.    oh, this is great.   owooh... whoowhoo.  i'm howlin' hal continuing with our bonnie smooth marathon.  : wow.   hi, there.  who are you.  that's george.  we're here for the free tickets.  hey, first time in a radio station.  uhhuh.  come on in.  i'll show you how it works.    that's the instructions for running a radio station.  but you don't need it 'cause i'm gonna show you.  george: ooh...  see these.  these headphones let you hear howyousound, and how the music sounds.  oh.  ooh.   that's the mike i talk through, but it isn't isn't on.  i have to hit this button.  oh.  i play cd's just like you do at home.  uhhuh.  now i'm putting in the next song to play so there won't be any silence between songs.  the worst thing on the radio is dead air.   that's when there's no music or talk, just nothin' gonna out.  hey, how are you at howlin'.   okay, step right up.  uhhuhhuh.  three...  two...  one.    and here's bonnie with her beautiful instrumental song "sassafras serenade".    hey, know what's happening later.  bonnie smooth is calling in at 2:00 to play a new song on my show.  wow. that's exciting.  want to help me with the interview.  ooh. uhhuh.  ickets george, you coming.  uh... uhuh.  okay. you can stay here and practice your howl.  uhhuh.   be a good little monkey.   helping hal would be fun.  the cd player looked like the one at home...  ooh.  ...but everything else was totally new.   hey...  howlin' hal said these were the instructions for running the show.  aha.   huh.   oh.   maybe it was hal.  george could ask him to come and let him out.    hello..  everything in this room had buttons.  which one was he supposed to push.   man: howlin' hal, i love you, man.   hey, can you howl for me.  uhhuh.   whoohoo. you're the best, man.   george did it.  he'd figured out the phone.  now he only had...  80 billion more buttons to go.  luckily, the man and hal were back.    we're locked out.  don't you have a key.  i dropped it somewhere around here.  i use the book to keep the door open.  george wondered why they weren't opening the door.   wait a minuteearl.  earl the janitor.  he has a key.  only earl's at lunch, and that cd's about to run out.  that's when george realized they couldn't open the door either.  now what.  oh...  if only we could get the next cd going.  that would give us time to find the key... or earl.  maybe george can do it.  oh... he has to push the "play" button.  a button.  well, george is great at pushing buttons.  which one is it.  the one with the triangle.  okay.  but the booth is soundproofed, so how are we gonna tell him.  oh.  a triangle, a triangle...  huh.   huh.  huh.  what were they doing.  didn't they know there was no time for games.   george knew all the bonnie smooth songs, and this one was about to end.  the worst thing on radio is dead air.   he's not getting it.  hey. i can draw a picture.   why were they coloring.  the song was about to end.  how could he play more music.  the cd was in the player.  all george had to do was hit play.  but which button was it.  hey. a triangle.  george: aha.  maybe it was the triangle button.    good job.  he did it.   bonnie's calling soon, and earl's still not back.  we've got to find that key.  oh, boy.  this was no time for playing around.  wasn't bonnie smooth calling at 2:00.  something had to be done.  answering the phone and playing a cd were easy.  but he didn't know how to work the mike and those sliding things.   he had the book.  here we go.  first the mike, then the slider, then the phone.  this looked like a phone interview.  oh...  oh. does he not realize bonnie smooth is calling in five minutes..  maybe george can hook up the call.  he can make popcorn and program the vcr.  there are a lot of steps.  we could draw another picture.  it worked last time.  i think it's too much to show in a picture.  i know.  we'll make a model.   man: done. it looks...  uh, terrible.  close enough.   howlin' hal: the phone.   we forgot the phone.    oh.   howlin' hal.  the call wasn't coming through the phone this time.  what had he forgotten.  bonnie: hal.  howlin' hal.  owow...  oh, i thought i'd missed you.  how are ya.    he did it. yes.  whoohoo.  my boss always said a monkey could do my job.  thanks for letting me come on with my new song.  i wrote it special for you, you know, and it goes like this.    something good is coming    don't know where or when    i feel my heart adrummin'    how long has it been.   i'm back.  did i miss anything.  hey, there's a monkey in the booth.  howlin' hal: not now.  he's in the middle of an interview.   howl it loud and sweet...   george was very proud of himself.  he had run an entire radio station.  maybe someday he could even learn how to tie his shoes.   oh, dancing down the sidewalk, swinging on a breeze...   girl: george followed instructions to run the radio show.  we are using instructions, too.  we are using instructions to make two chairs and a table.  man: look at the chair instructions, and let's see if you can follow them.  peter is helping.  we tried putting the seat on first.  oops. whoa.  these instructions, they don't tell you what order the pieces go in.  it doesn't show what the different steps are.  try fitting the sides onto the back.  girl: his idea was to put the seat back on first.  now we just have a bunch of screws to put in.  you guys ready to do the table.  i think the table is gonna be faster to do because it shows you which step to do first.  one, put in the pegs.  two, put the legs on the frame.  three, attach the top.  you should follow the instructions.  it's a lot easier.  narrator: there are lots of wonderful things to see in the desert.  the man with the yellow hat and george were on a fossilfinding vacation there.  here we are, george.  the quints' home away from home.  ooh. ah.    i'll tell the quints we're here.  that lizard had the fastest tongue george had ever seen.  huh.  it seemed like everything moved fast in the desert...    ...including rabbits.  luckily, monkeys are pretty speedy, too.  okay, george, ready to look for fossils.  uh, george.  now, where could he have gone.    hi, there.   i'm john. john atahalne'.  you must be george.   the quints said their monkey friend, george, was coming to visit.  and you're the only monkey i've seen today.   ah, what a wonderful interruption.  in fact, my name atahalne' is navaho for "he interrupts."  i'm a hatarii. a medicine man.  one thing i do is make paint.  huh.  john's paint looked a lot like rocks.  you see, instead of painting with paint, i paint with sand.  oh... ah.  i grind differentcolored rocks into sand.  ooh...  the canyon has all the paint supplies i need.  ooh...  whatever colors i can't find there, i make with food.  oh...  and then, to paint, i take the sand and let it slip through my hands, like this.  oh...  ah...  and there you are...  a george in sand.   man: george.  i think someone is looking for you.  uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.  shall we go get him.  uhhuh, uhhuh.  the man had to see this.   hey.    ohoh.  john's painting used to be there.  now it was there and there and there.  man: george.   john's going to go hunt fossils with us.  do you want to come.  uh...  or play with your rabbit friend.    okay, we're that way, at the river, if you need anything.   bye, george.   he needed to fix the painting before they came back.  luckily, he had a lot of paint supplies.   but paint was very hard to make.  oh...  maybe john had some already ground up in those buckets.  but it was all sandcolored sand.  and then george remembered...  whatever colors i can't find, i can make with food.  george: ah...   mrs. quint: oh, there you are.  would you like a snack.  uhhuh.   now george had lots of colors to choose from.    huh, george sure likes his fruits and vegetables.   now he had lots of paint colors: red, blue, orange, even purple.  : oh...  but no brown.  and you can't make a monkey without brown.  hmm.  george knew where he could find some, though.   hey, there.  did you decide you wanted to dig for fossils.  here's a bucket for you.  mr. quint: got a place for you right next to me.  uhuh, uhuh.   what a clean little monkey.  um... yeah.  that's george for you.  now that george had brown paint, he was ready to make the rest of his colors.   except the bunny had its own idea for the fresh fruit.  oh, there you are, george.  you took off so fast, i didn't get to ask what you'd like to drink.  i have cranberry juice, carrot juice, grape juice, blueberry juice, wheatgrass juice...   george took one of each, 'cause an artist never knows when a rabbit might eat his art supplies.  thats one healthy monkey.  the juice worked great. no mashing necessary.  ah...  george had his paint, and his new friends had lunch.  only, his sand didn't slip.   it stuck.  maybe it needed to dry.  watching paint dry was about as much fun as, well, watching paint dry.  aha.  george thought of a way to speed up the process.   he wants a hair dryer.  in the desert.  but instead of drying, his paint went flying.   ah.  so george found a way to keep his paint in place.  plus, the bottle made painting a snap.  huh.  george's friends had developed a real taste for art.  : oh...   so george found a way to keep his painting safe from bunnies.   but not breezes.   it almost made him miss the sticky stuff.  ah. aha.   do you need a napkin.  uhuh.  fork.  uhuh.  radio.  uhuh, uhuh, uhuh.  aha.  of course.  glue.  why didn't i think of that.  a monkey with glue.  he had his paint, he had his canvas, and he had an audience.  he glued.  he painted.  he could do them at the same time.  and if he put on too much sand.   uhoh.  no problemonly the sand on the glue stuck.   he couldn't wait for the man and john to see it.  ah...  why wait.   his sand painting was portable.    tada.   wow.  is that a sand painting.  uhhuh.  you are some artist.    for me.  thank you.  but why.   that's okay.  sand paintings are supposed to get messed up.  that's how the medicine is released.  oh.   oh, no.  you don't have to mess up this one.  some sand paintings are medicine, others are art.  well, i guess giving glue to a monkey was a good thing after all.   yeah.  ah, say, george, think maybe you could make one for us next.  yeah.  he sure could.  but...  ooh.  ...he'd need a new canvas.  girl:john taughhn taught george about navajo sand painting.  we are playing some native american games.  boy:the name of the school is nuweetooun.  it means "our home." we're going to show you a couple of traditional games.   this is a ring and pin game.  we're finding sticks and twigs for the ring and pin.  it has to be very flexible, and then you've got to bend it slowly.  boy:and to do it, you've got to swing the stick, and try to make the ring go like this.  girl: we're making a gourd rattle.   girl: we use rattles for our native games, like the moccasin game.   one person hides the stone in the moccasin, and the other person has to try to figure out where the stone is.  spears: ah, he did find one.  we're keeping our traditional culture alive.   summersafari august.  george: ah ahh ahh ahhh.  vo: with the premiere
