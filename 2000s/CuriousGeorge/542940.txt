had grown tired of the same old bathtub frog and boat races.  : eh...  he needed new tub toys.  hey.    huh.  done with your bath, george.   well, then please get back in the tub.  you're puddling.    this was george's box of stray stuff, none of which had ever been played with in the tub.  hey.   ah.   huh.  eh....  none of this stuff made for exhilarating monkey tub action.  this disappointing bath was over.   some of the stuff was moving on its own.  ooh.  theseweregood tub toys.    ah.  aah.   uhoh.  george wasn't sure how to get all that fun stuff out of the drain.  it went down with the water, so logically, if he addedmorewater...  it should all float back up.    huh.   oh, boy.   just a second, george.  water's backing up into the sink, and i don't know why.   in the bathroom, too.  oh, no. ii'd better call the plumber.  george like it when mr. auger, the plumber, came over.  he had the best toolbox george had ever seen.  ooh.  good to see you again, auger.  is it.  no one calls a plumber until there's trouble.   : just once it would be nice if someone called to say, "come over and have a cookie." would you... like a cookie.  i would... but i have work to do.  where's your water main shutoff valve.  uh, downstairs.  take him, hundley.   hey, george, you can watch if you're curious.  ooh. uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.  now, these pipes lead to all the rooms in the building.  ooh... ah...  some bring the water in...  ...and some drain it out.  this main valve controls the water for the whole place.  ooh.   there.  now everyone's water is off until i turn it back on.  it's like, uh, having a super power.  oh...     thisbreaks up clogs.   nothing there.  clogs can be evasive and mysterious foes.   : the plunger squishes water down the pipe to help push away the trouble.   ah, there.  i have made contact.  clog located.  : oh...   where didthatcome from.    if it went down the drain here, how did it get in the kitchen.  now, based on the evidence, i would deduce young george drained the tub after a bath.   auger: the water current carried his toys down the drain, through the pipe to the kitchen, where the snake got tangled and stuck.  unable to pass the clog, water filled the pipe and came back up your drains.  here's your problem: those aren't tub toys.  can't you buy the poor guy a boat.  a nice rubber duck.  mr. auger reconnected the pipes, then had one last thing to do.  would you like to open the main and allow everyone to have water again.    no. open it.  leftyloosey.  uhhuh, uhhuh.     hundley wasn't sure george should be taught things like this.  george, would you like a boat or a... nice ducky.  uhhuh.  i'll go first thing tomorrow.   : um...  you'll clean up, so i can go buy toys now.  uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.  remember how to use the dishwasher.  first scrape the food off the...  bye.   george, being a good little monkey, did just as he promised.    hmm.   uhoh.   water was backing up out of the dishwasher this time.  why.  mr. auger must have missed a clog.   : oh.  it was a good thing george had watched him closely.   rightytighty shuts off the water.     he did everything mr. auger had done but didn't find a clog.  if the last clog moved to the kitchen, maybe this clog had moved downstairs.    oh...  this was too big a job for one monkey.  he'd better go get the man with the yellow hat from the store.  being a good plumber, george reopened the water main so everyone would have water.  being a monkey, he forget he'd opened the taps in the apartment.  hundley was relieved.  with george gone, nothing sloppy could happen.      pipes should always be properly tightened.    : george, when you came to the store and wanted me to come home, did it have anything to do with the water pouring off of our balcony..       ooh. ooh.  did you call the plumber yet.  is something wrong.  i was on the roof feeding the pigeons.   holy hinges.   hundley.   oh, boy.  found your clog.  you can't dump food in the dishwasher.  ah...   and from now on, leave plumbing to the experts.  that would be me.  uhhuh.  his plumbing days over, george enjoyed a nice, hot bath with his new tub toy...   ...guaranteed never to slip down the drain.   girl: george is a monkey, so he can do stuff that we can't do.  ge is a monkey, so he can do stuff that we can't do.  he tried to fix the clog, but instead, he made a flood.  we are playing with the hose.  katy's parents had a bunch of pipes and connectors.  we're trying to connect all the stuff so water can go through it.  boy: there's two outs from the tube.  you could turn the water on.  it went two ways.  we put things in the pipe and then we ran water through it.  we're trying to see if the thing we put in there goes through.  it might clog the tube, like what happened to curious george.  whoa.  that's so cool.  oh, lookit, look.  it clogged.  i think it was a little bit too much stuff.  the water, it doesn't even decide, it just goes wherever it ends up.   narrator: it looked like the perfect day for a long hike in the nature preserve.  now, where are you folks headed.  lookout ridge. i need to do five scenic sketches for art class.  and i need to add to my deciduous leaf collection. i get it.  a looseleaf notebook.  that's one down already.  ah, it's gonna be a great day.  according to the map, the trail's that way.  all right.  um, george.  some days, even the most curious monkey just wants to sit and color.  let's go.  eh...  i promise you'll find hiking exciting.  hey, have a safe hike.  speaking of safety, you have our food, matches, firstaid kit and rope, right.  all here.  good. i have the map, and we each have water, and whistles, in case we need to signal someone.  great.  : a silver birch.  can we stop. oh, sure.  this could be my second sketch.  how could anyone be that excited about trees.  huh.     done.  all right, everyone ready to move on.  : yeah.   george.  hikers hike out with everything they bring in, or they use a trash can.  okay.  aha.  aha.   we go...  left.  good.   cool.  george.  look over here.   therethere was a beaver right there.  you just missed it.   say, this would make a nice sketch.   seeing a beaver might be exciting.  that beaver couldn't stay under forever.  all done.  see any beavers.  eh.  they must be in their lodge.  that's what they call their house.  they enter it from underwater.   sorry, george, time to move on.  : oh...  "hiking" must be another word for "disappointing." ooh.  wow.  ah...  man: um, george.  veer...  right.   bill found rare leaves.  the man with the yellow hat sketched.  but george didn't see anything he couldn't see at home.    we made it. lookout ridge.  all right.   well, we'll stay a while, then hike back.  huh.  that's right.   they had to hike all the way back again.    wha... whoa.  i've got you.  whoa.   oh. no problem.  no problem.  well, how do we get back up.  well, proper procedure is to call help.     huh. hey.  george.  hey.  could you please toss me the rope from my pack so we can climb up.  uhhuh.  aha.  wait. tie it to something first.  okay.  got it. okay.  oh, boy.  that was not a proper choice for a rope anchor.  i know, bill.  george, do you know the way back to the ranger station.  uh... uhuh.  no problem. i've got a map.  but we've got to get it to george.  i know how to make a perfect straightflying paper airplane.  here it comes.   oh....  oh.  oops. wrong design.  that was a loopthelooper.  yes. yes, it was.  oh.  george needed to find the ranger station and get help. but how.  hmm...  these were all the places they'd passed.   so if he went past those places in backwards order...   ...they'd lead him to the ranger station.   follow the pictures. good idea.   he's going to get help.  so, we should wait here, right.  um... yeah.  at the first fork in the road, george had a decision to make.  huh...  that was the same craggy tree.  uhhuh, uhhuh.  picture four, turtle peak.  ah.  um, bill.  this is how you start a fire.  um, bill, we don't need a fire.  did you know many parts of a tree are edible.   at the next trail crossing, george had a problem.  how could he find the beaver lodge if he couldn't see it.   huh.  aha.   uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.  oh, hey.   could it be true.  beavers really did enter their homes underwater.   oh...   now what would he do.  this is bad, but i can think of 56 different ways it could be worse.   my hat. my... my hat.  57. want me to list them all.  one:..   at the next trail crossing, george had to pick a direction, but all the trails looked alike.  aha.   george had never been this excited to see his own garbage before.   well, hi, there. can i help you.     i gotcha. i'll go get my rescue gear.   good work, george.  tada.  my hat.  you know, george brought me right to ya.  he is quite a tracker.  aw...  whoo...  hiking was exciting.  george couldn't understand why more people didn't do it.   girl: george is a monkey, and he can do things that we can't do.  they lost their map, then george had to figure out how to get back.  christina is making maps for us to use to find a treasure.  like curious george, you guys are gonna have to try to use landmarks to figure out your way, and then you're gonna try to get to where the "x" marks the spot, and that's where you're gonna find your next map.  i see the trash cans right over there.  the two trash cans are on the map.  they found the pole on the map, so they will go to the right towards the "x." niko found the next map.  there were five tables, and the "x" was on the one farthest away.  yeah, we found the treasure.  the treasure was chalk.  it's important to know how to use a map because people will be able to find their way very easily. )
