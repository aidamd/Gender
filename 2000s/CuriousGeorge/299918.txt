curious george.   oh...  captioning sponsored by nbc/universal narrator: there's nothing like spending a long weekend in the country with some of your closest inflatable friends.  aah.  oh.  i'm not sure you needed allthose pool toys, george.    it'll be dark soon.  do you want to go say hi to everyone while i...  george... george.    don't be too long.    george had a lot of friends to say "howdy" to...   ...the pigs...  ah, oink, oink.   ...mrs. renkins...  moo.  ah.  whoa there, george.   you gave me a turn.  ...and of course the chickens.  ooh.   huh.  did george just see a girl in there.  huh.  hi there.    i have been sitting there for one whole hour and guess what.  you want to guess.  you want to guess.  you'll never guess.   i am really glad that i'm not a chicken.  so if you're thinking "i wonder what it's like to be a chicken," i can tell you.  it's not very interesting.  george had seen a lot of strange things in his day, but this was strange.  well, i see you two have met.  george, this is my granddaughter allie.  oh...   oh, are you a monkey.  i like monkeys.  do you want to play tomorrow.  : yeah, uhhuh.  allie's a spark plug, but if there's anyone who can keep up with her, it's you, george.  bbye. whoops.  don't forget about tomorrow.    bright and early the very next morning...    allie : hiya, george.  huh.  that man with the yellow pantshe said i could go see if you're awake.  are you awake.   uhhuh.  finally.  oh, you were sleeping forever.  so, you know what i want to do today.  monkey stuff.   huh.  oh.   wait, don't monkeys go out the window.   huh.    ah, rats.  all that morning, george showed allie "monkey stuff" like how to eat strawberries...  ah.  ...with your feet...  whoops.     ...how to swing on a rope...  ...how to sound like a full percussion section in an orchestra...  george.   ...and how to blow bubbles with an extra big monkey breath.  i'm going to the store.  do you want anything, george.  uhuh.  did you know that monkeys can blow bubbles longer than anybody.   that doesn't surprise me.  how about you, allie.  you need anything from the store.  oh, yes.  um... a flying trapeze...  and a walkietalkie, please.  uh... i'll see what i can do.  bye, everyone.  be a good little monkey...  and girl.    huh.   is that a squirrel.  uhhuh, uhhuh.  i love squirrels.   whoops.  does he live in that tree.  uhhuh.  hey, let's go see.  race you.  hi there.   i found him, george.    i think this hole is his house.  whoops, i can't see anything.  do you have special seeinthedark monkey eyes.  uhuh.  oh.  we need a flashlight.  oh, i know.  i have one in my room.  i'll go get it.  whoops.  except... how do i get down.  hmm.  ah.   tada.  yeah, only i can't really do that 'cause i'm not an actual monkey.  so how would a nonactual monkey get down from a tree.  hmm.   okay.  are you in there.    george, it's kind of weird.  the squirrel won't answer me.     okay, so ladder plus monkey wasn't tall enough.  what else could george use.  a balloon.  no.  parachute.  no.  but then george remembered how he washed mr. glass' windows on the very tall buildg.  yeah.  this was going to be easy.  all george had to do was find his life vest, tie a rope to the front, throw the rope over a branch, and bring allie down.  hey, george.   maybe he'll come out if i talk squirrel talk.  what do you think.   okay, here goes.     okay.   yah.  you missed, but don't you worry.  i can get it.    this is too small.  it looks monkeysized.   the rope was a good idea, but george needed to attach it to something that allie could put on or...  ...get on.         whoops, this raft is too flippy, george.   okay, let's think some more.   george didn't have that many choices.  only a tooshort ladder, some pool toysanda rope.  oh, aha.  what could be easier than holding on to a rope..   but we already tried the rope, george.  aha.   okay, now what, george.   you want me to hold on while climbing down.  uhhuh, uhhuh.  okay.   whoops, i ran out of rope, george.  hey, look what you did, george.   whoohoo.  finally.   let's do it again.  huh.   hey, it's mr. yellow pants.  did you get me the flying trapeze.  sorry.  the store doesn't carry circus equipment for some reason.  but i found these.  ooh, walkietalkies.  i have to show my grandmother.  byebye, i'll call you later.  thank you. thank you.  thank you. thank you.  : you're welcome.  so, george, did you have a nice time with allie.  uhhuh.  that night, george couldn't wait for lights out.  man: "and so the little mouse roared and the house fell down."  good night, george.  happy dreams.   allie: allie calling george.  allie calling george.   allie calling george, over.   ooh, it works.  hooray.  : yay.  uhoh...  : yay.  okay, so i figured out how to make friends with that squirrel.  first, we grow a tree.  uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.  then we take all the nuts...  clearly, this was the start of a beautiful and curious friendship.  and we go hide...  uhhuh.  and when the squirrel comes in to get the nuts, uhhuh, uhhuh.  ...and say, "hi, squirrel." you think that'll work.  uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.  girl: george is a monkey, and sometimes he does things that you can't do.  he tried to help ally by using a rope.  this house has an upstairs porch and a downstairs porch.  girl: we surprised the downstairs kids by lowering a marker.  the string is kind of...  like an elevator.  an elevator is something that brings people and stuff up and down.  boy: hey.  we want to control the elevator from down here.  boy: and this is called a pulley.  we're going to wrap the string around the pulley.  now we are controlling the elevator from down here.  i hope you guys are hungry.    whoohoo.  thanks for the grapes.  you're welcome.  an elevator is a very useful tool.   narrator: in the city, dogs have all kinds of jobs.    there are firehouse dogs.   and guard dogs.  )))))))))) ha show dogs.   and dogs that put on a show.  but of all the dog jobs, surely door dog was the most important.   why, thank you, hundley.  i have to run this upstairs.  keep an eye on things for me, will you.    : doggie.  a toddler and his toy clown were no match for a lobby dog.   look, dylan, hundley brought your toy.   thank you, hundley.  uhoh.   george could mess up a lobby faster than ten toddlers with toys.   huh.  huh.  hey.  there was only one thing a door dog could do.  return that toy and fast.   which, to george, looked exactly like a game of tag.    chef:  20 crates of tomatoes...       george couldn't figure out why hundley didn't want to play tag anymore.   : georgie.   it was dylan's toy.  uhoh.           if there was one thing gnocchi couldn't resist, it was a toy clown.    hey. unhunh.  chef:  three cases of olive oil    20 crates of tomatoes   hello, my little gnoccherina.  what do you have there, a clown.  oh, so cute.  now, don't chew it all to pieces, okay.  i must keep my basement tidy.   hundley had better rescue that clown fast.   ten sacks of potatoes    five wheels of parmigiano    flour for linguini    and fettuccine     all other 'inis, too   now, where was that cat.        chef: holy prosciutto.  i forgot to buy the garlic.    now, what kind of chef forgets his garlic..  gotta go back to the store.   hundley might be a door dog, but he wasn't very good at doorknobs.    fortunately, monkeys are excellent door openers.   unless...  the door is locked.    chef pisghetti:  three cases of olive oil...   uhoh.    hundley remembered that he didn't like basements.  locked basements, especially.             gnocchi thought it'd be much more fun if she and hundley played outside.    poor hundley.  clearly, hundley needed some monkey help.            getting hundley out of the basement was going to be hard.  too bad windows don't come with stairs the way doors do.  hmm.  aha.   hmm. uh...  not high enough.   he definitely needed more stairs.            uhhuh.      george was surprised that hundley couldn't reach the window.    gnocchi was surprised that hundley was still in the basement.        gnocchi was sure that a game of chase would make hundley feel better.   it did.  it took his mind off basements.        ah.  george could build a ramp to the window.    a ramp stronger than a pizza box.   aha.       hundley was beginning to like this game.     george had to remind him that he wanted to get out of the basement.  gnocchi had had a lot of fun with the clown, but now it was hundley's turn.         maybe hundley just needed a... push.       george needed to think of something else.  ah.  maybe he didn't have to go straight up to the window.    george didn't need one ramp.  he needed a lot of ramps.  aha.   george's ramps worked.     leaping linguini.    what did you do to my basement, giorgio.    huh.    dylan and his mom were back.   hundley had to hurry.     gnocchi didn't know what was going on, but it sure looked like fun.      hundley.   thank you.  i thought we'd lost this forever.  look, dylan.   clownie.   you are the best door dog.    another job well done.   well...  almost done.    boy: george is a monkey.  he built ramps so hundley could get to the window.  tada.  girl: this is a place where the stairs and the ramp go up to the same level and connect.  and we're going to have some races.  go.  girl: c.j. and i are running up the stairs.  evan and will are running up the ramp.  yeah.  girl: the stairs won.  go.  boy: it's a kicking a ball race.  girl: and it took me a lot of energy to get the soccer ball to dribble up the stairs.  the dodge ball for the ramp was easier for evan.  i won.  girl: we learned that the stairs takes less time, but it has more work.  and they're shorter, but they're more steep, and the ramp is on a less steep angle, and if it's less steep, it's easier to get up.  but it's longer.  and the winner is...  evan.  month, pbs kids is giving your mid week a shake up.  kratt
