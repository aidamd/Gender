 to pick out healthy meals.  miss rosa: well, where do we start.  let's have a vegetablebroccoli.  good choice. what else do we need.  how about some chicken.  you need protein, which you can get from things like chicken, fish, milk, or nuts.  let's have some soda to drink.  i don't see soda on our healthy food chart.  we should probably drink some water instead.    a healthy, balanced meal.  how about dessert, miss rosa.  i really want a cookie.  well, i think one would be ok.  for more fun like this, check out "sid the sciencekid"'s healthy foods game at pbsparents.org.  here's my cookie,

curious...    like curious...curious george.   oh...  captioning sponsored bynbc/universal  narrator: a dog bouncing down the sidewalk meant two things.  one, charkie had gotten loose again, and two, george was in another challenging game of follow the leader.   ooh.   ...even for a monkey.   ugh.  : gotcha.  time to go home, girl.  hi, george.  bye, george.   : oh.   ah.      oh...   if only hundley could be a fun dog...  ...like charkie.     hundley had tricked him.  he ran all the way upstairs to play.  this was a perfect time for george's new soccer ball.    aha.            now hundley didn't want to play.  that dog just couldn't make up his mind.   uhoh.  accident.  let's go get you cleaned up.    george decided he wouldn't bother hundley anymore today.      now hundley was playing again.  george didn't understand it...  ...but he wasn't going to complain.   he'd never seen hundley act like this before.    huh.   uhoh.  george figured he'd clean up so hundley wouldn't get in trouble and be discouraged from acting fun.   now you're looking crisp.    oh, no.  what happened.  my desk.  someone has...   george.  george, what are you doing.   you didn't do it.  uhuh, uhuh, uhuh.  well, then, who did.  uh...  it's not a big deal.  just tell the truth.  george didn't want to get hundley in trouble, but he had no choice.  no one will be upset by the truth.  well, if no one would be upset...    huh.  both: hundley did it..   now, george, think hard.  can you really picture hundley jumping up and making this mess.  hmm.  oh.  something was wrong here.  hundley wouldn't ever mess up his lobby.  maybe george could use his camera...  oh.  ...to figure out this mystery.   aha.    ah.    ooh.   huh.   hundley was jumping around again.  he needed some good pictures of this.    ooh.   ooh.  george: ew.   oh.  maybe dog food made hundley jumpy.   only one way to find out.  george didn't feel any different, so it wasn't the food.    hundley was more energetic than ever.  ah.  now he wanted to go back out to play.   huh.  oh.  was hundley pretending to be asleep.    or had his mood changed again.   huh.      george did want to play, but he had to solve the mystery of...   ...hundley.   this was too much.  was hundley sick.  no, his nose was cold.    he sorted his photos into two groupsquiet, normal hundley, and lively, unusual unhundley.  he didn't even know what he was hoping to see.  then...  oh.  ...he noticed something.  normal hundley had a brown collar, but jumpy hundley had a red collar.  huh.  charkie jumped around a lot, and she had a red collar, too.  aha.  george had the solution.  red collars make dogs jump more.  ah.   ooh.  ah.  to test his theory, george put on a red tie.  hmm. he didn't feel different.   he couldn't jump higher.  oh.  maybe it only worked on dogs.  oh.    hundley thought he sure was looking good tonight.  huh..      huh.     oh. ah.  that explained everything.  hundley was acting like two different dogs because hewas two different dogs.    whoa. ooh. ooh. ooh.  hundley..  george. doxie.   i've got you.   i'll take her.  my poor little doxie.  oh. yes, she... yes, she did.  this is my sister dorothy.  doxie has a way of getting loose.         wow.  if i didn't see her right there, i'd think that was hundley wrecking the place.     hey.   george was having so much fun with doxie, maybe some day hundley would meet a monkey he could have fun with, too.  rl: george is a monkey, so he can do things that you can't do.  he compared different hundley pictures.  george was looking at two pictures of hundleys, so we're gonna do the same thing today with leaves.  this leaf has seven leaves on it and this one only has one.  okay, that's a very good difference.  jake's two leaves are the same shape, but different sizes.  this leaf is bigger because the tree is bigger.  this leaf came from the branch.  this trunk is a lot thinner.  these leaves come out on the side of the stem, and these leaves come out on the one part of the leaf.  i think it's fun to learn stuff in nature, then you could become a good artist or a good scientist or a good person who makes poems.   narrator: the city is always a feast for an observant little monkey's eyes.   and this morning...  ah.  ooh.  ...george was feasting on bold, colorful signs.    wow.  that's a pretty startling poster, huh.  uhhuh.  hi, steve.  i didn't know you worked here.  i don't.  i just change the posters when new movies come, and the manager lets me keep the old ones.  hmm.  ooh. ah. steve: my collection's huge.  i bet i hold the most poster record.  you want to see it.  come on.  uhhuh, uhhuh.   sure, george.  have fun.     ooh. ooh.  hey.  ah.   having a collection's great.  my favorite stuff's always around me.  uhhuh, uhhuh.  at that moment, george decided he needed two thingsto start his very own collection of his favorite stuff...   oh.  ...and to stop spinning around.   oh.  oh.  all the way home, george tried to decide which of his favorite things to collect.   aha.   ah.  he could collect greatlooking signs, just like that guy.   ah.   george set out to find the bestlooking signs in town.   aha.     ah.  hey.   ooh.  yeah.       aha.  hmm.  sadly, one of his favorite signs was too big to take home.  ah.  ah.    hmm. uhhuh.    boy, they really make the animals earn their keep here.        ah.   huh.  george had a sign hundley might like...  ah.  ...a smartlooking dog with a bright red line.  oh.  : aha.  oh.    hundley did enjoy his sign...  ...but not for long.   sorry, fella, you can't be in here.   george's collection was off to a great start.  but there was still plenty of room.  so, gege went ba to the park.    pedestrians only.  ah, says who.   somehow, the park seemed different.  i'm sure the picnic area was this way.  no, no, it's that way.  everyone seemed less relaxed.    it's gotta be somewhere.  keep looking.  hmm.  no one is buying ice cream.  officer, where is the picnic area.  just follow the signs.  hey.  there should be a sign there.   could people be unhappy because the signs were gone.  i don't see any signs.  uhoh.  if people missed them this badly, he'd better put them back.   hey, rules are rules.  you saw the sign, right.      hmm.  george didn't remember which sign was on this post.  uhha.  so he picked one that looked good.  if everyone enjoyed signs the way he did...  ha.  ...they'd like this one here.   whoa.   choosing where to put the signs was as much fun as collecting them.   it was a lot of work, but george rehung every sign.  thanks.  uhoh, that dog got in here again.  i'll take him out.   what.  no, hundley belongs here.  then why do you have this no dogs allowed sign.   no dogs allowed.   this doesn't belong here.  huh.  does it, hundley.   oh.  wait a minute, if this sign had meaning, maybe all signs did.    are you sure this is right.  man: that's what the sign says.  oh.  this was not the place for canoeing.     hey, it's this way.  we made it.  get the oars out.  i, i thought you brought the oars.  byebye.  if canoes belonged near the lake, a bear would belong near woods.  honey, we found the picnic tables.  "don't feed the bears." there are bears here..  run.  then again, maybe a picnic table would be more appropriate.    um... never mind.  it took some thinking, but george figured out which signs went where.  but i want ice cream. please.  i'm sorry, i really don't have any.  aw, don't even ask.  she won't give you any.  all day people keep asking me for ice cream.  is it the white coat.  hmm... maybe it's this.  who put that there.  george, have you been moving signs.  uhhuh.   that must be how we lost our "no dogs allowed" sign.   the sign shop's making a new one.  want to see how they do it.  uhhuh.  we make all our signs.  rectangles to help people find things...  a circle for what you can do...  and a red slash for what you can't do.   you want to make a sign.  uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.  here, i'll help you put this up.  george knew just the sign he wanted to make.  it was for his bedroom door.   a sign that not only looked good, but was very useful.  uhhuh.  girl: girl: george is a monkey, so he can do things you can't do.  boy: george didn't know what the sign said.  girl: we can read signs and make them, too.  and we're going to set up roads using cones.  and we created two roads that crossed.  kind of like an intersection.  i'm going to choose four people.  you're all going to take a ride into the middle.  everyone was like...  like got into a big bunch and almost got into an accident.  what signs do you all think we need to make this a safer intersection.  stop signs.  boy: we could stop so the other person could go.  boy: she went through the stop sign and i tried to give her a ticket.  girl: you should try making your own traffic signs.  it's really fun. trust me.  you know, curious george loves learning about math, so let's play a little math game together.  ready.  i have 5 cars, and i'm gonna taketwo of them away.  vroom. vroom.  how many carsdo i have left.  kids: 1, 2, 3. 3.  great job.  5 minus 2 is 3.  you can play more gameswith curious george at pbskids.org.

tree.  it grows into another tree probably.  the seed is inside the spiky fruit from this tree.  all right, let's look for seeds from this tree, guys.  boy: leon couldn't find any seeds on this tree.
