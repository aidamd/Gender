george each morning meanta new surprisethe moment he stepped outside.    oh. ow.  some mornings,he didn't even get that far.   oh, hey, guys.  meet goliath. he just moved into the building.    his owner has a guest who's allergic to dogs.  so goliath is helping hundley and me in the lobby today.   if you callblocking the elevator helping.    whoa.     oh, a delivery.  wow. look at all the packages.  it's new lights for the hallways.  let's store them in the basement until the electrician comes.     whoo.   oh, hundley, could you get that.        that was not a chew toy.  huh.  thanks, goliath. hello.   goliath could reachreally tall places.  hundley wondered if thedoorman's job would be easierwith someone like goliath.  oh.  he could put mailin the high mailboxes...  and take it back out again.  he could call elevators.  he could probablyeven put the star on topof the christmas treree.   no problem. bye.  thanks, goliath.   that goliath sure is a big help, isn't he.  he sure is.   it was true.the doorman did wanta taller door dog.   george wonderedwhat would cheer up hundley.  oof.  hey, i know how we can make hundley taller.   stilts. i had a pair when i was little.  they're fun.        huh.  ah.  here, hundley. you try.  then george realized:dachshunds couldn't use stilts.  they didn't have handsto hold onto them.   ah.  if only they made stilts you didn't have to hang on to.    huh.what do you know.  they did.  ah.all george neededwere dog shoes...  with platform soles.  oh.  oh.   oh. oof.      oof.    making hundley taller is harder than i thought.   marco was right.  maybe they could findanother way to make him tallerto cheer him up.  the store didn't have anythingto make a small dog tall.  huh. hey.   or maybe it did.  hundley was smallon the outside.  but hundley's spirit was as bigas the biggest dog.   maybe if he couldsee himself as big, he'd feel big again. aha.  hey.  ah.   you're right. maybe just looking tall will cheer hundley up.  yeah.  this flexible mirrorwas just what hundley needed...  to feel good again.  we'll take it. uhhuh.   hundley, come look.   george, uh, i look really short.  huh.  the last thing hundley neededwas to feel smaller.  hmm.  i don't understand. we looked tall in the store, but short here.  hey.  i look really... wide.  huh.  ha. that's weird.  i was wide over there, but i'm thin over here.  each new bend produceda different reflected image.  hey. hey.   ha.    and one seemed perfectto make hundley feel taller.  ah.   huh.  he'd done it.  the monkey had made him taller.    hundley couldn't wait toshow the doorman.    hey, hundley. welcome back.  i was really worried about you.  i seem to have forgotten my keys. can you let me in.  absolutely.  huh. my keys were right here.  where'd they go.   hmm.  huh.  i don't know what i did with them.   did ya find 'em.  it's closed. they wouldn't fall through there.    hundley, look what we've got.  hey, what's going on.  the doorman lost his keys.  oh.  where could they be.  hundley could see he would justhave to get those keys himself.   the keys wereup there somewhere.  the boxes for the new lightfixtures made a great stairway.     the doorman's keys.   huh.    hundley, what are you doingdown th my keys.  you really saved the day, hundley.  no kidding. there's no way a big dog like goliath...  could have gotten inthatittybitty space.  hundley, watch the desk for me, will ya.     hmm. it's a mirror we made for you...  so you'd look really tall.  uh, back when you wanted to be tall.    george figured they couldstill use the mirror.  only now it wouldjust be for fun.  you can play too, goliath.  ah.       that's real teamwork.  there are good things about all different sizes. uhhuh.  and with the new mirror, changing sizes had never beenmore fun.  george and marcoplayed with reflections...  to make hundley look taller.  we are playingwith reflections too.  my chin is so pointy.  we're gonna pick something to look at our reflection, to make a selfportrait.  i'm drawing what it looks likewhen i hold it close.  and this is my drawing.  it looks like he did himself in a weird mirror, like he really did.  the reflection that i see is perfectly normal at the top.  this is the part that's normal. this is the part that's sort of getting notnormal.  one: his ears got stretched out.  two: his chin got wider.  this curved mirroris bending my reflection.  it is very fun doing somethingsuper unusual.  it makes you look at yourself in a whole new different way.  on the first day of summer, george and billalways played a game ofmonkeyrules baseball.  ooh.  okay. three balls and two strikes.  so here it isthe pitch that will decide the entire game.  ready.  yeah.    got it. got it. got it. got it.    don't got it.monkeyrules baseball...  is pretty much the sameas regular baseball.  you run around the bases.but then it gets complicated.  you have to touch a fence, something blue a cow and the man with the yellow hat. oh.  safe. i assume you touched a cow.   hoo. that makes it a tied score.  i guess you'll have to play one more game to decide the title.   sorry. no can do. as a newspaper delivery specialist, i know from sad experience the dangers of getting overheated.  we need to cool off.  we should take an inaugural dip in my pool.  whoohoo.  we'll cool right down once we get into thatugh. tank of green stuff.  huh. algae.   a city kid like you probably doesn't know thisyuck.  but even though algae looks like grass, it's actually a lot of tiny organisms that grow in the water.  oh.  guess i should have covered the pool last fall.  the proper way to handle a situation like this...  is to dump it out and fill it with clean water.   ready. one, two three.   it's not working.     you lift the bottom, and i'll pull the top to flip it over.  uhhuh.    well, this isn't going to work.   we need a bulldozer to turn this over.   ah.   a shovel.  uhhuh.  not exactly the bulldozer i had in mind.   uhhuh. good idea, but it's going to take forever.   hang on. i know.  hmm.   perfect.  here.     huh. ah.    these sure aren't moving enough water.  i need a break.  so hot.  uhhuh.   good idea. the shade is a lot cooler.  i'll pour us some lemonade.  yeah.    my arms have given up.   i know.   i'm a genius.  don't move, george.  i'll make you a really long one. uhhuh.   i'll just stick a bunch of straws together.  okay, that should belong enough. ah.   sucking lemonadethrough that long straw...  turned out to be hard work. oh.   but eventually, it came.  and kept coming.  the straw wanted to keep going.  by itself. ooh.  okay, let's go empty that pool. then we can really cool off.  yeah.  now what could we use to empty out the water.  using a paddle...  sure didn't take out much water.  and the sponges...  clearly didn't either.  neither would the boots.   and pans weren't much better.  well, at least we figured out this isn't a job for oars, rubber boots, sponges, blankets, buckets, pots, pans, cardboard boxes or yellow rain hats.  the water still hasn't gone down.  hmm.  yeah. something really big ought to do it.  hmm. aha. perfect.   has anyone been touching my cow.   we were playing baseball.  oh. did you touch a fence.   hey, can we borrow your grandpa's washtub.  sure. what're ya workin' on.  wow. that's the "greeniestest" thing i have ever, never seen.  yeah, we know. but we'll get that slimy water out fast with this.   all together. one, two three.   whoa.       that was the hardest i've worked in my whole entire life so far today.  the hard workhad made george thirsty, but he wasn't surehe trusted that straw.   but this time,it didn't go by itself.  what was different. ooh.  george tried againfrom lower down,like he did before.   hey.  hey. george invented an automatic straw.  oh, you have the straw below the pitcher, and gravity is pulling the lemonade out.   hey.   if the strawcould drain a glass,what else could it drain.  ah.  is george gonna drink the pool.  george, don't drink the pool.   george wasn't going to drinkthe pool.  he was going to drain it.  aha.   it's emptying itself.  wahoo. we did it. we did it.  yes.  how fast is it emptying.  i think we need a bigger straw.  yeah. like a dinosaur straw.  i don't think dinosaurs used straws.  dinosaurs didn't have hands, right. right.  so how'd they drink their milk.  you got a point.  hey.    all george had to do...  was get the end of the hosebelow the water level,suck the water in...  and then let gravity take over.  but sucking water out of a hosewas a lot harder than sucking itout of a straw.   too bad we don't have a dinosaur.  a dinosaur would have that pool empty in a second.  hmm.   he was going to give ithis best dinosaur try.    it works.   of course.  you were below the water level, and gravity pulled the water out.  yeah. mmhmm.  hey. not bad for a city kid.   you did it, george. yeah. ha.  hi, guys. my hose sprung a leak.  mind if i use yours, bill. i gotta water my plants.  hey.george had one more idea.  wow. what a great way to use a siphon.  hey. there's even a word for it.  now we just have to clean the inside of the pool, fill it back upthen we'll be swimming in no time.  that's all.  cannonball.    the water was cold and clean.   so with a little helpfrom a siphon, summer went swimmingly.  george made a siphonto drain the pool.  we are using a siphonto clean our fish tank.  my mom came in to help usclean out this tank here.  first, we take a bitof the water...  and put it in a small tank,and put all the fish in there.  this is the siphon that we use...  to get the waterout of the tank.  and, sophie, you're gonna put the whole siphon into the water.  the air is going out of the tube and the water is going in the tube.  my thumb is on the hole, to keepthe water from releasing. )
