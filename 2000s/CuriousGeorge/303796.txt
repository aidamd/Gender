'course, if i move to outer gitchee goomie, i'll need a whole new paper route.  do they even have paper routes.  oh.  narrator: george wished there was a better way to study what the dancers were doing.  i'm gonna miss you, buddy.  send me a picture now and then, will ya.  hey.  ah.  hey, my camera.  great idea.  a movie's way better than a picture.  bill: come on.  do something city kidy.     you want me to film them.  oh, so i can watch it and learn to dance.  uhhuh.  oh, well, hi, boys.  you want to learn this.  well, it's called the box step.  it's very simple.  we step in time.  the music keeps us together.  slow, quick, quick, slow.  quick, quick, slow.  quick, quick, slow. quick, quick, slow. very good.  quick, quick, slow...  if you move to outer gitchee goomie, do you have to get a bunch of shots.  tanganyika.  that sounds far away.  "dear allie, i'd love to come to your dance party, but i'm in tanganyika."  quick, quick, slow.  quick, quick, slow.  quick, quick, slow...  you can replay that all you want, but i'm never going to get it.  it does look hard.  mmm. i wish i could dance.  quick, quick, slow...    ...quick, slow.  quick, quick, slow.  quick, quick, slow.  quick, quick, slow.  quick, quick, slow.  quick, quick...   bill: dancing should have a map.  huh.  a guy can read those.  maps tell you where to go and how to get there.  narrator: george needed a map to tell his feet where to go.  the renkins' dance didn't have a map.  oh.  narrator: but it was about to.  first, george counted the number of steps he would need.  slow...  quick, quick...  narrator: then he arranged them like a map.  oh, very clever, george.   uhhuh.   anyone want to go fishing.   oh. what's this.  uh...   ourour dance map.  we're learning the box step.  oh, the box step, eh..  narrator: this time, george placed the dance steps so they could watch each other.  ready.  sure.  i guess.  is left right...  oh, uh, so sorry.    quint: um...   oh.   narrator: george needed a way to tell which foot was which.  how's this.  "dear allie.  i'd love to come to your party, but i have chicken pox."  measles.  quint: okay, now, uh, uh, bblue is left, and red is right, but which is first.  hmm.  narrator: george wondered.  what was the best way to put these in order.  numbers. good idea.    wint: hey.  we've been looking all over for you.  we saw your bike outside.  are we going fishing.  well, as soon as i learn the box step.  the box step, you say..  um, uh, question.  which steps are fast, and which are slow.  i get it.  the quick steps are smaller 'cause they take less time.  uhhuh.  you're pretty smart for a city kid.  oh.    ooh.   it's hopeless.  we know left from right, fast from slow, where to go and when to go there, and we still can't dance.  what is this map missing.  oh...  mrs. renkins: we step in time.  the music keeps us together.  narrator: the problem wasn't the map.  aha.  narrator: it was music.   they needed some to keep them together.         man: all right.  others: slow...  quick, quick, slow...  quick, quick, slow...  quick, quick...  we're doing it.  : we're dancing.   at last the big night was here, and george and bill were ready.  boy, i'm glad i didn't have to move to outer gitchee goomee.   wait a minute.  we can't go in there.   i can't put this goofy map on the floor.  dohdedoh, i'm such a bad dancer i need a map.  oh...  thatwouldlook a little silly.  : does this make me look like i have mumps.  hiya, george.  hey, bill.  thanks for coming to my party.   oh. did you go to the dentist.  : what are we going to do.    whwhat's wrong.  uh... my shoe's untied.  but it's velcro.  i need to tighten it.   oh, okay.  how can we remember the dance without the map.  uh...  hmm...  ah.  and then george saw it.  ah, ah, ah, ah.  bill: hey.  the box step was shaped like a box.  i see.  all we have to do is make a box with our feet.  uhhuh, uhhuh.    uh, may i have this dance.  why... certainly.    sure.     that's some fancy dance.  bill, you dance beautifully.  and george, too.  i wishiknew that dance.  you mean...  you don't know it.  the only dance i know is this.     woop.   your dance looks fun.   and i've got the perfect song.  it makes me think ofyou,george.  aw...    whoo.    where's my banana.   left is blue, and right is red.   in the midsummer heat...   the george school of dance was definitely getting off on the right foot.  boy: george learned how to put dance steps in order.  we are putting some other kinds of moves in order.  this is calvin chin martial arts academy.  curious george was dancing, and this is not exactly dance, but we are using moves that are similar to dancing.  it's called kung fu.  boy: punching, kicking, stance.  would you like to see us demonstrate some forms.     a form is a group of movements in a special order.  girl: there's certain, like, stances, there's certain punches that we put together one by one to make a form.  today we're performing at belmont library.  girl: i like kung fu because it's the thrill of performing.  i think it's good exercise, too.   narrator: monkeys like knocky sock.  uh... uh.  they're knocky...  they're socky...  and they're easy to grab with toes.      pisghetti: georgio. haha.  oh, oh, come. meet the newest members of the family.  oh.  ah.  okay, this is eenie, this is meanie, this is miney, and this is freckles.      now i can have the fresh eggseveryday.  and fresh eggs, mwah.  they make everything beautiful.  ooh, you come tomorrow, georgio, and i will make you a nice, fresh egg omelet with pesto and peppers.   but the next day...   oh, georgio.   oh...  ...therewereno eggs.   : oh...  orthe dayafterthe next day.  what i'ma gonna cook.   or the day after the day after the next day.    ah, there is no hope.  i wonder why they won't lay the eggs.   hmm, hmm, hmm.  maybe they don't like their food.  oh.   okay,newfood.   ah...  but the next morning...   well, i guess it was not the food.  hmm.  hey, you think maybe they don't like their beds.  hmm.  yeah.       oh.  well, i guess it is not the bed.  hmm.  ah.    you think they don't like gnocchi.  uhhuh.   ah. uhuh.   ah, maybe they're just unhappy here.  i guess i'll have to send them back to the country.   george didn't want his new friends to leave.  he'd miss them.  the chef would miss them, too.    the chickens seemedhappy enough.  they pecked around happy as can be every day.  maybe they were unhappy at night.  there was only one way to find out.  is that gonna be warm enough, george.  uhhuh.  okay. see you in the morning.  brighteyed and bushytailed.       that night...  things got a little noisy.  it was clangy and bangy...   ...and yowly...   and howly.    sometimes all at once.    so the next morning, instead of being brighteyed and bushytailed...   ...george was just bushed.  georgio.  you look so tired.  did you not get any sleep.  mm... uhuh.  george just couldn't seem to wake up.   george wondered ifthatwas the problem.  what if the chickens were too tired.   maybe if george could find a way to keep things quiet for the chickens, they'd be able to lay some eggs.  yeah.  and then he remembered.  whenever things got too noisy forhim...  he used his fingers to keep sound out.  hey.    but chickens don't have fingers.  since the chickens couldn't use fingers, to keep noise out...  they needed a place where noise never got in.  luckily, george knew a place that was really, really quiet.   at last, an egg.  the chickens were happy.   huh.  but the librarian wasn't.   mom, could i check out a chicken.  hmm...  what did the library have that the chicken coop didn't.   aha.  ah.  books.  oh...   george was on to something.  the cookbooks kept some sound out.  uhuhuh.  oh.  i'ma sorry, georgio, but i need them.  they have all my secret family recipes.  they are so secret, eveniforget them if i don't have the books.  oh...  and then george realized, books were just a bunch of paper.  aha.   and he knew where to find lots and lots of that.  the recycling room was full of it.   aw...  but he ran out of paperand he still needed to cover the roof and the floor.  maybe the recycling room had stuff for that, too.   hundley couldn't figure out what that monkey was up to.  huh. oh...  cans didn't make things quiet.  aah.  neither did bottles.  ah.    but packing peanuts did.   ah.   oh, yeah.   ah.  cardboard might come in handy, too.   doorman: ah, thank goodness you're here.  everything was piling up.  newspapers, boxes, packing peanuts.  huh.   oh, yeah.  i see what you mean.   packing peanuts made chickens wobbly.  hmm.  uhhuh, uhhuh.  so george put them where the chickens didn't walk.     bubble wrap was aterriblefloor covering.  but cardboard worked great.    now if he could just keep sound from coming in the window.  uhoh.   but that made the coop look spooky.  ah.  aha.  maybe that bubble wrap was good for something after all.   george could hardly wait until nightto try the coop out.  but he didn't have to.  once he finished soundproofing, the coop was so quiet, he fell asleep.   and it wasn't even nap time.  it was the quietest coop ever.   still no eggs, huh.    ah.   eggs. hehheh.  you fixed my chickens, georgie.   now we can make my famous pestoandpeppers omelet.   and to george, breakfast neversoundedso good.  girl: george made the coop quieter so the chickens could sleee coop quieter, so the chickens could sleep.  we are trying to block sound, too.   jon was cutting some wood, and it was so loud, we had to cover our ears.  jon: well, this is ear protection, 'cause you heard it was pretty loud, right.  it's time to build your own ear protection.  boy: we're copying the designs of those ear muffs.  you have to make it big, and then the sound can't break through.  my design is i stuff this with foam, )
