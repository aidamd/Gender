hundley would play with him.   hundley, it's nice to see you having fun with your friend george.   except hundley wasn't playing.  he was trying to protect the dignity of his doorway.  ooh.   huh.  a job made all the harder by the start of flea season.   uhoh.  first flea of the season, huh.  i'm going to buy flea soap right now.  you watch the door, hundley.      ooh.   ah.  hello, george. ah.    oh.  oh. shoot.  bye, hundley.     hundley could finally reach that itchy spot, which felt great... until he saw that he was out of uniform.  oh.  this was completely undignified.  he had to find his collar.    oh.     are you trying to drink that dirty water.   oh. how sad.   no collar.  oh, you have no home.  ohyou can relax now.  i'll get you clean water and a loving home.    here you go.    huh.  there was no hundley.  huh.  he'd never left his post before.        who was that lady, and where was she taking hundley.     sisley.  i found another poor stray whose life we can enrich.    hundley couldn't understand why this nice lady would bring him to such a terriblelooking place.      oh, what a handsome guy you are.  and you look so dignified.  well, maybe it wasn't all bad.  this one had excellent taste.     oh, don't you worry.  we'll find you a new home full of everything you've ever wanted.  what hundley wanted was to get out of here and go home to his lobby.    huh.   oh. huh.     hi. huh.   hundley was never so happy to see george.  it was pretty obvious he wanted to go home.   ooh...     oh.  : oh.  dachshund found on n avenue.   sisley, how long have we had a monkey here.  a what.  : there is no monkey in here.       excuse me.  please do not shake up that nice dog.    oh, we found a stray monkey.  and so cute.  we could find him a new home easily.   we have an open cage right here.  huh.       too bad.  i like monkeys.  let's get back to finding a nice home for that dachshund right away.  george didn't know where the doorman or the man with the yellow hat were.  he'd have to free hundley himself before it was too late.   first, he'd need someone who could distract the women.     second, he needed someone who could open that cage.    if anyone could open that cage, it was charkie, the dog escape artist.  next, he had to explain his hundley escape plan to his team of experts.   he showed them where the cages were, and which one had hundley in it.   oh.   huh.   well, you liked the flea bath, huh.  you were an itchy fella.       phase one, the distracter.   i'm coming, i'm coming.  who is it.  oh, gwen, you've got to come see this.  what.  oh, how sweet.   oh, look at this.  i'm going to eat you up.  well, don't you think that's the cutest thing you've ever seen.  you are too cute.  aha.  phase two, the escape artist.      at least phase one worked.    hmm, who was that.  we'd better check the cages.  uhoh.  there's no one missing.   shh.  now, gnocchi was getting locked up, and george couldn't open the cages.  or maybe he could.   shh. please.   thank you.  if he squeezed this, it moved those things and unlocked the door.   was he forgetting something.  like the sliding bar across the top.  aha.  he was so sure it slid out.  maybe he pushed when he should've pulled.  hey. tada.     shh.  george hadn't figured out phase threehow to get out unseen.  would you please go see what's upsetting them.  oh, it's just the cleaning lady.  oh, the cleaning lady.  stop her, please, i've got to pay her.  too late, she's gone.  there was one step left to complete george's plan.  and now that hundley felt dignified again george could get back to his game.  and hundley could get back to defending his lobby's dignity.   girl: s a monkey, so he can do stuff that we can't do.  boy: he figured out how to unlock the cages.  we are learning about locks, too.  george had to solve a problem and that's what we're doing.  boy: this is boston lock and safe company and it's a great place.  how can i help you today.  this lock isn't working.  girl: this lock is actually inside the doorknob.  they had a lock that the key was not turning correctly in.  that's larry.  larry: the reason your lock wasn't working is this isn't exactly the proper key for this lock.  the pins do not line up correctly.  but we can fix that.  girl: matt and larry taught us a little about keys and locks.  when the key goes in, the pins come down, then it forms what is called a "shear line." the shear line is when all of the pins are lined up correctly.  and that would allow the lock to open.  you see how that works.  we're going to put a #2 pin.  see how it lines up and it comes just right up to the right spot.  girl: we helped to put in the right pins to match this key.  larry: the key is in all the way, then you have the shear line, and then the lock will turn.  now the key works.  girl: larry fixed it so that you could use that key and that would work.  there you are, miles.  thank you.  you're welcome.    oh...   man: uh, george, have you gotten those...  toys put away yet.  aha.  wow, that was fast.     well...  if you can't fit your toys in here, you should probably give some away to make room.  huh.   hey, i got an idea.  let's get some fruit crates from the market to help you get organized.  oh...  uhhuhuhhuhuhhuhuhhuh.  narrator: george wasn't sure if the fruit crates would help...   but he liked the fact that they smelled like apples.  ready...  set...  go.   done.  way to go, son.  you shaved two seconds off your average time.    but george won't count as a produce item in the competition.  sorry, george.  i guess i got carried away.  i'm training for the final round of the bag olympics on saturday.  this could be the year we finally beat large mart.  they've won three years in a row.  maybe you could teach george how to pack his toys this neatly.  uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.  sure.  i can show you how it's done, george.  you could help by timing me with the stopwatch.  hit that button to start counting the seconds.  hit it again to stop it.  and hit the other one to reset.  okay, be a good little monkeylearningtopackstuffneatly .  george was sure all those groceries would not fit into one paper bag.  the clock's running, i know.  oh...  oh, i hate canned hams... although they are delicious.  they're a bagger's nightmare.  what a weird shape.  it's short, it's tall, it's round, it's flat...  it's the beast of all processed meats.  canned hams are the least of your worries.  hello, rodney.  i've got a new technique for bagging deli meats that'll make your head spin.  you want to see speed.  come on, george.   i'll watch from out here.  wouldn't want anyone to mistake me for an employee ofthisplace.  ow.  ooh. ooh.   bad sprain, but you'll be as good as new in a week.  but the competition's this weekend.  rodney: too bad.  i was really looking forward to beating you.  why are you in my doctor's office.  i care about my competition, but it looks like i have none.   oh.  rodney, we have another bagger who could beat you with three hands tied behind his back.  huh. huh.  huh.  that monkey.  george has worked at the store so he can represent us in the contest.  well, i, uh... oh, yeah.  uhhuh.  it'll take practice, but i'll teach you everything i know.  will you do it.  uh...uh... uh...  yeah. uhhuh. uhhuh. uhhuh.  ready.  go.  well, that was very fast.  george thought he had done a pretty good job.  after all, everything was in the bag...  near the bag...  or leaking out of the bag.  uhoh.  remember, always put the lighter stuff on top.  heavy stuff like soup cans should go on the bottom of the bag.  oh.  who knew bagging groceries could be so complicated.  think outside the bag.  the key is seeing what items fit together best.  boxes and cans are easy.  oh.  and see how this apple and this banana fit together.  ready.  go.  looks like your bagmonkey's not so good with lunch meat.  that's baloney.  he knows exactly what he's doing.  this competition is so in the bag.  you almost had it. get some rest and you'll be ready for the big day tomorrow.  oh.  george sure didn't feel ready.  he wished there was some way to practice more before the contest.  oh.  aha.  george realized it wasn't just food he could practice fitting together.  host: welcome, folks, to the 14th annual bag olympics.  our contestants are warming up before the threeround bag elimination contest.  look. it's not whether you win or lose.  it's how you bag the produce.  just go out there and have fun.  on your marks, get set, bag.  i'm done.   keep your head up, george.  just do your best in the next round.  on your marks, get set, bag.   i'm don... what.  all right, george. you did it.  looks like we have an egg break.  that's an automatic elimination.  george is doing great.  all of our hard work must have paid off.  the monkey's gotten good.  but don't worry. i'll win this.  all righty, then.  it's come down to these two.  representing large mart, the fastest bagger this side of endless park, the angsty teen from avenue 14: rodney.  and, representing city grocery, the monkey with moxie, the battling bagger from n avenue: george.   baggers, are you ready.  uhhuh. uhhuh.  yeah. ready to win.  on your marks, get set, bag.  oh, no.  a canned hamthe beast of all processed meats.  oh, oh, oh.  think outside the bag, george.  yeah.  george realized that ham and cheese always go great together.  yes. done.  me. it's all me.  and the winner is rrrrrrr...  no.  george.  no.  all right, george. you did it.  great job, george.  but how did you get so good.  i am impressed.  hmm. too bad there's no room for your trophy.  hmm.  girl: george is a monkey, he can do things that we can't do.  girl: he was trying to fit things in the bag.  we are trying to fit shapes in...  all: tangrams.  and this is a traditional chinese tangram puzzle.  girl: i think it was made to be fun.  woman: a tangram is made up of seven separate pieces.  two large triangles.  two little triangles.  a medium triangle.  a square.  i don't know what this shape is called.  and the challenge is for you to make the square.  boy: there is nothing to show us where it goes except experimenting with where it does go.  boy: we used all seven shapes to form the square.  girl: alycia did it.  shapes can make other shapes.  boy: now we are trying to make a picture using all seven shapes.  boy: i was doing the running person.  i would try to cut out the shapes with my mind, so i could see what shape goes there.  woman: now you can check it.  boy: it's right.  it seemed impossible when i was doing it, but now it seems clear.  for more fun withcurious george and his friends, visit your local library and read morecurious georgeadventures.  or visit
