"now, castles weren't just for kings and queens.  "butlers, maids, cooks "and carpenters lived in them, too.  lots of people lived in castles."  i've always thought it would be fun to live in a castle.  high on a hill overlooking the ocean.  in fact, i would like each of you to draw a castle thatyou would like to live in.  oh. ohoh.  yes, allie.  um, what if we would rather live in a submarine.  then you draw a submarine.  ooh, uh, now i have to go talk to the janitor.  i'll be right outside if you need me.  hmm...  hey.  george had an idea.  instead of drawing a castle, why not build one.   a castle for mrs. gold to live in.  aha. aha.   what are you doing, george.    oh, you want to build a castle.  for mrs. gold.  uhhuh.  yay. well, let's go.  hmm, maybe castles weren't allowed in kindergarten.  maybe he should ask.  the bookshelves, the waternot a problem.  but sand in a carpet.  that's a problem.  mrs. gold.  george wants to know if he can build a castle instead of draw one.   hey.  george's school tool made a great construction level.  at last, the castle was ready.  all it needed was a tree.  yes, well, thank you.  that wasmostinformative.  i'm sure it will look...   oh, my.  it was george's idea, but we helped.  when you said a "castle," you meant acastle.   oh, this is wonderful.  it's amazing what you can do when you use your imagination and work together, andhave a monkey to help you.  oh.   yay for george.  yay for george.   it was good being a guest monkey.  but it was also good being a plain, old regular monkey on his way home.  kid: george is a monkey.  he visited his friend, allie, in kindergarten.  kids: "k" "e" "i" "r" "a" keira.  boy: keira is in preschool right now.  she wants to find out what kindergarten is all about.  bigkid school.  all: "it is wonderful wednesday." keira: the teacher is mrs. perry.  she made me feel happy.  girl: it's a little different, 'cause you learn different stuff from preschool.  preschool, you get to play, and you learn some things.  in kindergarten, you learn shapes and numbers.  and sometimes, you learn how to write letters.  at the writing center, we draw an animal.  and write two sentences about it.  do you know how to write.  just a little bit.  colleen told me about the word study center.  you write the word and you highlight it.  teacher: this is the math center, and we're playing 3d bingo.  boy: at the art center, we draw and paint.  kid: i think keira did a very good job, 'cause she really enjoyed herself.  keira: if you're going to kindergarten, don't worry about it.  it's fun.  narrator: ordinarily, monkeys don't go to school.  so, when an opportunity arose to go to dog school...   ...george was very excited.  for most dogs, it was easy to learn hand signals from their owners.  then there was charkie.  you try, george.  even the stay command wasn't as easy as it looked.   i wish charkie would get it.  i'm worried she won't pass her obedience test.  of course she'll pass.  you are the best puppy in the world.  yes, you are.  unhuh, unhuh.  there's a new rule in our building that says all dogs must have an obedience certificate, as if chare needed such a thing.   whoa, charkie.  anyway, thank you for filling in for betsy.  she's playing in a concert tonight, so we have to leave.  ah.   here, george.  she's all yours.  so long, my little sweetie.  oh, time to go, betsy.  we mustn't be late.  betsy: thanks again, george.  oh. i almost forgot.  those are her favorite dog biscuits.  bye.   all right.  i'll just be over there, sketching.   mr. barker: for the final exam, each of you will use hand signals for "jump," "go up," and "pause" to guide your dog through various obstacles.  your dog will have one minute to complete the course.  failure means no diploma.    and now, to show you how it's done, may i present the course record holder and my best student, ever: hundley.  huh.    george.  in a dog obedience class.  mr. barker: first, we have "jump through the tire." steelbelted perfection.  now, on to the seesaw.   ooh.  such footwork.  the pause table.  your dog must remain absolutely still for five full seconds.   good.  the aframe.   nailed it.   and one last hurdle.   pedigreed pooch perfection.  thank you, hundley.  class dismissed.  good luck tomorrow.  you'll need it, i'm afraid.   george thought he should probably practice the course with charkie.  huh.  hmm. what was distracting charkie.  a tennis ball.   sorry, george, but you can't practice now.  i have to clear the field for outdoor ballet class.   hmm...  george was going to have to find some other way to practice the course.  aha.   oh, you need paper.  uhhuh.  sure.   george had decided to draw the course, so he could make another one just like it.  the obstacles looked kind of familiar.  the aframe looked like a triangle.  george could draw that with three straight lines the seesaw was like a smaller triangle with a line on top.  the tire was a circle.  the pause table a square with four equal sides.  the low jump had two short sides and one long middle.  george had a drawing of the entire course, and just in time.  phew.  huh.  now all george needed to do was build the course.   oh.  hey. aha.  i, i think i'll take the stairs.   huh.  huh...  george and charkie divided the work.  george built the course...   while charkie entertained the pigeons.  huh.  hundley wondered what george was doing to his roof.   ha.    huh.   george did not make a very dignified dog...  but he did make a nice dog course.      clearly, this job called for a wiener dog.    george and hundley tried "follow the leader." they tried cold dog nose...  ooh.  but they couldn't get charkie to do anything right, even keep still.  especiallykeep still.  so, how did obedience training go, george.    wow, i'd bet she'd do anything for one of these biscuits.  would charkie really do anything.  hey.   ooh.   hey.   the next morning, charkie did everything perfectly, thanks to george...  and the biscuits.  hi, george, i'm back from the concert.  how's charkie doing.   george, you did it.  who says you can't teach a new dog old tricks.  uhhuh.   you're next, charkie.   40 seconds.  excellent.  and now our final student.  this should be interesting.     huh.  five seconds.  the dog biscuits were all gone.  what was george going to do..   oh, no. i can't look.  a tennis ball.  maybe that would work.    20 seconds.  oh, that's my puppy.  three, four... five seconds.  i don't believe it.   only two more obstacles to go.  nothing could go wrong now.  betsy: yay, george.  yay, charkie.  40 seconds.  huh.  oh, no. pigeons.   george couldn't compete with pigeons.   unless...     oh, you did it.  you finished the course.  good girl.  good girl.   do you think she was fast enough.  charkie, i have no choice but to...  award you this diploma.  you are now officially obedient.  59.9 seconds.  all right.   your techniques were rather, uh, unusual, george, but perfectly acceptable.  good work.  that's my charkie.  so obedient.  hmm. how could anyone think otherwise.   girl: george is a monkey.  boy: he drew a plan, so he could set up a course for charkie.  we're gonna get a new rug.   what we're gonna do is figure out where we're gonna move our furniture.  and we were gonna make space to put this new rug for our classroom.  each team is going to get a grid.  girl: the grid represents the floor space of our classroom.  boy: we made little pieces of furniture out of construction paper to represent that piece of furniture.  it's much easier to move pieces of paper instead of moving around big pieces of furniture.  girl: four teams made plans, and we will vote for just one plan.  originally, our classroom was set up really boring.  we want to be a little more fun than this, so we mix up the colors for the tables and we put the rug right here, so it's close to the books.  we have tables in a different design.  we have it kind of like an s.  we're gonna take a vote, but the thing is, you can't vote for your own team's plan.  boy: the green table's plan got the most votes.  i voted for green 'cause i liked how they put miss gardi's desk in the middle.  i voted for the green table because it fits the rug.  a plan is important because if you don't know what to do, then how are you gonna to do it.  ..  with my magnifying glass, i can find peter rabbit.  announcer:
