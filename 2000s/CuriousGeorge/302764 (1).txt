wondered whoor what made them.  oh, hey.  everyone else's footprintswent one in front of the other.  huh.  but these footprintswere side by side.  huh.  ah. ah.  and they werereally far apart. ah.  yah. ooh.  aha. ah.   the only wayyou could get that far andkeep your feet side by side...  wasaha.  by hopping.  rabbits hopped.  maybe it was a giant rabbit.  orclowns have big footprints.  maybe it was a hopping clown.  or maybe it was a gianthopping clown rabbit.    george, it's bedtime.  ohh.   a bunch of dugongs were sighted off the coast.  dugongs are australian sea cows.  come on. let's go, george.  cows. that swam in the sea.  that did sound cool.  but a giant clown rabbitsounded even cooler.   you wanna stay here. are you sure.  uhhuh.  okay. wait. better leave my hat here.  since you won't be around to get it back for me.   bye, george. be a good little monkey.  bye.  now to find that giant rabbit.   there werethose footprints again.  only now the giant clown rabbithad a tiny friend.  it looked likethey'd stopped here fora drink of water, but thenaw.  the smaller footprintsdisappeared.  could it be.  when clown rabbits drank water,they could fly.  ahh.   huh.the little onehad landed again.  ah.    ah. oh.  the footprints weren't madeby a hopping clown rabbit.  they were made by aahello.  whatever thislittle guy was.  huh.  they had hopped around so much,they were back at camp.  hopping sure madea monkey thirsty.   maybe his friendwas thirsty too.  if only he had a bowlto feed him with.  it'll dry out and be as good as new.  ah.  aha.  george's new friendlooked cute in the man's hat.  but he couldn't keep it. hey.    it was the biggerwhatever it was.  oh.his small friend couldn't fly.  he'd just been getting a ride.  ah.george had to get that hat.  ooh.  but his new friendswere too fast.  hmm.  they were pretty stillwhen they were drinking.  but that watering holewas too far away.  by the time george got there,the animals might be gone.  if only he hadhis own watering hole.   yeah.  and then george realized...he did.   he just needed someplaceto put it.  ah.  yeah.  ah.  and a lot of waterto put into it.  he hoped his friendswere thirsty.    aha.  ah.   ah.  aw.  george was happy to havethe man's hat back, but he was sadhis new friends ran off.  ah.  george, you won't believe it.  sea cows are amazing. you wanna see.  yeah. uhhuh.  huh.  sea cow.  that didn't look anythinglike a cow.  george, what happened to the rain cover on the tent.  uhwelluhoh.  no worries, mate.  yeah. long day.   i could use a nice bath.   there you go.   hmm.   oh, this day just keeps getting better.  turn around and i'll show you my favorite australian animal.  aha.his friends were back.  those are kangaroos.  so that'swhat they were called.  they really like to eat grass.  just put it on the ground right beside you.  and that'swhen george decided...  kangaroos were his favoriteaustralian animal too.   that's the aussie way   george learned aboutthe animals of australia, and today we are too.  today we're at capron park zoo.  we came here to see the emus and kangaroos.  stephanie is the zookeeper.   emus are one of the largest birds.  we have the father, the two sons and the daughter on the side, and mom is separated.  in the wild, the dad will actually take over the nest once the female lays the eggs, which is very different from most other groups.   a kangaroo kind of looks like a bunny.   these are red kangaroos, so most males turn bright red, and the females are grayer.  an emu can walk like this.  but a kangaroo can go like this.  because their legs can't do this.  it's fun to see where they're from...  and how they live.   the only thinglittle monkeys like betterthan being in pictures is taking pictures.  hey, george. hey, bill.  look.  guess what it's of. you'll never guess. guess.  huh. umthey're perseids.  "pursey" what.  they're teenytiny animals that look like purses.  well, i think.  i heard my grandpa talking to my grandma about them.  he says you can see them best down by the lake.    george, that's a great idea.  let's get a picture of 'em.  that would make a perfect surprise for grandpa.  yeah.   wait.  well, where are you going.  uh  you can only see perseids at night, george.  oh. uhhuh.  but grandpa said you can see them best of all...  if you get up early, early, early in the morning.  uhhuh.  fishermen early.  and if you both come with me, grandpa says i can go.  sure.  uhhuh.  ah.  no. george, i can't take the picture.  uhhuh.  no. i may be great at doing drawings, but i'm not nearly as good a picturetaker as you.  ah.  besides, if i take the picture, i can't be in it.  see you bright and early.  uhhuh. bye.  early, early, early.     ah. ah.  hey, allie. george. bill.  what are you doing up so early.  looking for the perseids.  oh, they're beautiful. have fun.   this way.  keep your eyes open.  the perseids should be around here someplace.  grandpa said you can't miss 'em.  whoo.  shh.  ooh, ooh.   shooting stars.  wow.  ah.  be sure to save some pictures for the perseids, george.   okay, they're here somewhere.  do you see them.  uhuh.  no.  bill, you go that way. me and george will go this way.  aye, aye.   i hear something.    i hear something.   huh.  here.  hey. too late.  they're gone.  of course, because you scared them.  okay.  perseids are delicate, gentle creatures, like me.  well, this isn't going to work.  yeah. if only we had a way to talk to each other...  without making any sound.  hmm.   good idea, george.  we'll just wave to each other if we see a perseid.  uhhuh, uhhuh.  okay. let's go.  here, pursy, pursy, pursy.  well, he's waving.  bill's trying to tell us something.  huh. he's sayinggogo this way.   hmm.  that way. yeah. that way.  hurry, george.    what is it. well, where are they.  oh. i was saying there weren't any. it's my new signal.  watch.  shazooshazam.  "no perseids over that way." flimflambam"or that way." ohhh.   oogiewoodigewoogaboo.  what's that mean.  it means, "i can't tell what you're saying." oh. that's a good one.   yeah, george is right.  even if we knew what you were saying, it would be too hard to see you when you get to the end of the lake.  yeah. we need flashlights or something if we're going to signal.  mm. only it's getting light.  the perseids will all be hiding now.  at least we tried. yeah, i guess.  there's nothing left to do but go home and...  practice for tomorrow.  ooh, tomorrow.   okay, ready.  what does that mean. simple.  i am sending you a message. see.  well, it didn't look like that.  whatdidit look like.  hmm. flash, flashflash, flash, flash, flashflash.  hey, pretty close.  but how am i supposed to know what it means.  yeah.  it had been a long morning.  george was so tired, it took both handsjust to keep his eyes open.  what are you three working on so hard.   shh.  it's a surprise, grandpa.  hmm.  well, this should wake you up.  my super spicy hot curry soup.  be careful. it's zowie hot.  no problem. i love spicy stuff.  the spicier the better.    bill, do you think you should there. see.  oooh.  huh. what is it. what do you want, a napkin.   ah. oh.  bill was pointing becausehe needed a glass of water.  ah.  what is it, george.   how is "pass me the water" a code.   water.  oh.   oh.  hmm.  george realized their codecould be a lot simpler.  yeah. ah.  one flash meant "nothihihing here." two flasheshuh.  "i heard a sound." hey.   "it came from that direction." okay.   "it came from that way." george, that's great.  it's so simple and clear. not bad for a city kid.   so the next morningwith their flashlightsand their new secret code, the trio set outto find the perseids.  ohh.  okay.  ooh. whoop.  sorry.  wow.   hurry up.  operation perseids is on.  go, go, go.  nothing here.   one flash.  bill says there's nothing there.  oh.  two flashes. that means they heard a sound.  it came from over there.   shh. you ready, george.   okay.      george.  huh.   nothing, nothing.  nothing. all we have is a bunch of picturesthe perseids.  what. where.  right there. huh.   the perseids is the name of a whole bunch of shooting stars...  that you can see every august.  ah.  wow.  and george caught them on film.  pretty good for a city kid.  yeah.   you're the best, george.  oh, what a nice surprise, you three.  now, how about some coa to warm you up.  uhhuh.  is it spicy.   ah.  oh, quite a show, huh.  yeah.   whoa.  wow. oh, my.  even though they weren'tcreatures who look like purses, the perseids, or nature'sown flashing lights, were pretty amazing to see.  george f george figured outa flashlight code...  so they could communicatewithout words.  we like to playwith flashlights a lot.  and we havea flashlight code too.  my house is here, and matt'shouse is right over there.  we're going to make up some signals to tell him when dinner's ready...  and what it's going to be.  what should "spaghetti" be.a swervy "s." "pizza" should be a trianglebecause a slice of pizzais shaped like a triangle.  matt just asked, "what's for dinner." satchel answered "triangle," which means "pizza."  matt wants pepperoni.  i see two circles, that means he wants "pepperoni." dad, matt wants pepperoni on his pizza.  it's just what i ordered.  yeah.i think coding is really fun...  because you can talk to your friends in a secret message that no one else understands. )
