one second of christmas.        george, my spleen.    thank you.  and i am afraid it's still not christmas yet, buddy.  aw...  remember, we talked about this yesterday.  uhuh. uhuh. uhuh.  and the day before.  uhuh.  and every morning at 5:00 a.m.  since thanksgiving.  aw.   see, today is the 14th.  so, how many days are there until the 25th.  uh...  aha.  no, it's more than one.    there.  that's christmas.   this is today.  oh.  all these other days come before christmas.    i know.  for an impatient monkey, anything more than one day seemed like a million.  oh, those days will go by fast.  yeah.  you'll see.  every day will be fun.  ah. oh.    before the big day gets here    there's so much to get done    i think you're gonna find out    getting there is half the fun    christmas preparations    you can see them all around    people getting ready    almost everywhere in town    are you ready for christmas day to come.    sing it with me, or if you're a monkey, hum    hmm.   christmas in the lobby, always organized and neat    one and all are welcome    don't forget to watch your feet    curious george: hey.   ah. ah.  mmhmm, mm.   christmas time means winter winds    snow clouds fill the skyee    and if i had a chance, i think    i'd spend it in hawaii    are you ready     for christmas day to come.   yeah.   sing it with me    or if you're a monkey, hum    a feast of seven fishes    stop it.   first make five and then add two   gnocci, no.   it's a christmas eve tradition    hey, get off that, you.     chasing after charkie    every day all through the year    but when it's close to christmas    we always end up here   all:  are you ready   curious george: uhhuh.   for chrhristmas day to come.    sing or if you're a monkey, hum.   woman: merry christmas.  oh, time to go shopping.  curious george: byebye.  merry christmas, george.  man: merry christmas, george.  merry christmas.  ah.  hey.  hey, betsy.  hey, steve.  are you looking for christmas gift ideas.  well, we were chasing charkie and sort of got distracted.  hey.   oh.  oh. ooh.   ah.  aha.   i'm going to add that big xylophone to my christmas list.  betsy, you shouldn't put anything on that list you don't really want.  but ido really want it.  i'm writing a song on my xylophone, but it only has 15 keys.  more keys means more notes to choose, right.  oh.  uhhuh. uhhuh. uhhuh.  betsy's list is long.  mine is gonna break the record for shortest christmas list ever.  my whole list is just four lettersbikebike.    charkie, stay.   we got to go. bye.  charkie.  bye.  oh.  speaking of christmas lists, don't you need me to write yours for you.  aw.  have you even decided what you want.  uhuh.  huh.   you see how much preparing we still have to do.   oh. uhhuh.  narrator: george spent the rest of the day working hard on his christmas list.   uhuh.   uhuh.    ooh.  aha.  narrator: everybody knows a rhinoceros is the perfect christmas present, but walking one would be a lot of work.  uhuh. uhuh. uhuh.  ooh. ah.  ooh. ooh. aha.   narrator: then, all at once, george knewexactly what to put on his list.    oh. oh, that's a good one.  uh, george, you ready to make your christmas list.  ah.    well, show me what you want in the catalog, and i'll write your list for you.  uhuh.  no. but if you don't, how will i know what to put on your list.  haha.  is that it.  uhhuh.  you did it all by yourself.  uhhuh.  wow.  i'm impressed you did it alone.   and this is something i'd know you would like.  uhhuh.  have i seen it.   uhhuh, uhhuh...  narrator: of course the man with the yellow hat had seen it.  hmm.  ah.   huh. oh, you want me to write my list.  uhhuh.  you want to give me a present.   um, why don't you make me something.  surprise me.  yeah.   this is what you really want.  i mean, besides what santa brings.  oh...  narrator: was there something wrong with the list.  oh, don't worry.  now that i have your list, i'lli'll make sure you get what you want.  aha.    making a present was going to be fun.  hmm...  but how would george figure out how to make it.   ah.  first, he could draw it.  uh... huh.  but what was it.  huh...  this was going to take a lot of thought.   ah.  george woke up the same way he did every day since thanksgiving.   huh.  except now he had a chart to let him know it wasn't christmas yet.  oh...   christmas was still far away.  but george could use that time to think of a perfect present for the man with the yellow hat.  man: george.  ready for today's preparations.  we are going to get a christmas tree.    eh, there'd be plenty of time to think of a present later.  decorating the tree neatly was hundley's favorite ristmas preparation.    and here came the absolute opposite of an organized tree.  hey.   george.  good morning.  tree's looking good.  a man can accomplish anything when he's got a plan and a dachshund.  wow.   come on, george.  the early monkey catches the tree.   bye.     ooh.   all right, george, pick any tree you like.  welcome to mrs. renkins' prizewinning christmas tree farm.  george: ooh.   you know, there's a proper way to pick out a christmas tree.  i laid it out in charts and graphs.  i insist customers read every page, or i won't sell them a tree.   uh, you're a kid who knows a lot.  what does this look like to you.  oh, i'm good at puzzles.  it's not a puzzle.  it's what george wants for christmas, and i have to figure it out.  hmm, i guess it is kind of a puzzle.  uhuh, uh.     aha.  george figured he could see more trees if he was up high.  i don't know what that is.  maybe it's a city kid thing.  oh, boy.   huh.   george spotted the perfect tree.  oh.   george, you don't climb christmas trees.  proper climbing trees are your oak, your maple, your spruce...  climb down very carefully.  uhhuh.   whoa.     wow.  oh, no.   uhoh.    whoa.    huh.    i'm sorry, bill, ..  i'm going to have to research the proper way to display trees.  i don't think that's supposed to happen.  ah. aha.   that one.  uhhuh.  sure. here you go.    hi.     can you pull my chair off there.   yeah, there you go.  it's stuck.  yeah.  should we pick another tree.  uhuh, uhuh.   narrator: this was the one.  no other tree would do.  uhhuh.   not every christmas tree comes with a free chair.  thanks, bi.  merry christs.   george thought christmas preparations were pretty exciting so far.    hundley didn't like the look of this.    oh, let me guide you.  this way.   okay, keep coming.  man: oh, great, george.  you're doing great.  a little higher.  no, oh...  careful.  all right, just to your left.    george was gone.  the tree was safe.  hundley needed a rest.  keep following my voice.   huh.   having no hands, there was only one thing hundley could do.     okay, it's starting to feel heavy.   uh, let me give you a hand.  all right...   i got it.       uhhuh.  all right.  yeah.    uh, what's that.    huh.  aha.  hundley..  yikes.  oh, here, boy.   huh.  oh, no.  sorry.  we'll help you clean up.  uhhuh.  thanks, but we can handle it.  we're a great team.   oh, okay.  ah.   ha, it's perfect.  yeah. uhhuh.  except for youknowwhat.  hey, maybe i could cut it out.  uhuh.   george didn't want to risk hurting the perfect tree.  oh, i get it.  we can be a great team just like those lobby guys, right.   let's decorate.  uhhuh.   imagining the tree all decorated made george think about how much the man with the yellow hat would like his present.  thank you, george.   but he still had no idea what that present would be.  oh...      you deserve a gift that says more    than "here's what i found at the grocery store"    it has to be nice    and fit under the tree    but what in the world    could it be  you might like a car that has wings    a convertible with a spare tire that sings    but there's no such thing    what's a monkey to do    to find something as special as you.    you might like a pier that can fly    so every day you could catch fish from the sky    but there's no such thing    what's a monkey to do    to find something as special as you.    maybe you'd like everything that is yellow    you seem like a nice yellow thing kind of fellow    no, it has to be nice and fit under the tree    but what in the world could it be.    so how about a comfortable chair    that rubs your feet and then cuts your hair.    or how about some selfdancing pants    oh, yeah    that when you zip 'em up, they make you dance.    maybe i'll get you a magical spread    that fixes you breakfast in bed    no, it has to be nice and fit under the tree    but what in the world could it be.    so what should i get.    and what should i do.    to find something as special    as you.    to find something as special    as you.   when you wake up, george, we'll be one day closer to christmas.  aw.   in the morning, george went to see betsy and steve.    george is here.  george: hi.  hi, george.  ah.   betsy: what present am i giving aunt margaret.  she loves christmas songs, so i want to write one for her and sing it at the pageant next week.  oh.  but anything i think of is already in another song.   this is what older brothers are for.  i've solved your problem.  :  hang things on the walls like holly    we got christmas stuff hung on our walls    that's just "deck the halls." oh... yeah.  maybe every christmas song hasalready been written.  thanks.   narrator: being a nonmusical monkey, george couldn't write a song.  he needed other ideas.   huh.  hi.  hey, giorgio.   this is a famous chef pisghetti winter tomato snowman surprise.  you know who likes those.    ah, she likes any food.  i mean your friend, the yellow cappello fellow.  aha.  this was it.  the perfect gift for the man with the yellow hat.     turns out tomatoes can be...  squishy.    huh.  tomatoes need to be round to look like a snowman.  ah.  so the squished ones had to be refilled.   hmm.  i always thought i understood everything george wanted.   made any of your famous tomato snowmen yet.  : have i made...  of course.  you want that one.  oh, you bet.  thanks.   well, okay.  but you get just one taste, okay.    oh, she's a pretty girl.  yes, yes.  wow.  you two really communicate.  well, i understand her.   well, just like you understand giorgio, right.  yeah.  george, you home.  wait till you see what i got at the...    uh...  making your own ketchup.  uhuh.  huh.  okay.  oh.  you were trying to make tomato snowmen.  that would have been a perfect surprise for me.   not only did george need a new idea for a present, he had to take an extra bath.      professor wiseman.  hi.  do you have time to talk.  well, i am calculating the exact path of a giant asteroid's collision with earth.  uh, great, yeah, but this is important.  i can't figure out george's christmas list.   i told him i'd get him what he wants, but i don't know what it is.  oh, no.  what makes it worse, he knows whati'dwant: tomato snowmen.   he's so thoughtful and... messy.  bring him to the museum tomorrow.  i'll get him to explain it.  somehow.  oh, thanks.  good night.  : wait.  a giant asteroid's going to collide with earth.  it did, a long time ago.  it may be what caused dinosaurs to become extinct.  oh.  oh, that asteroid.  right.  good night.  hi, guys.  george: hi.  like our decorations.  uhhuh.  curious george: ooh...   that.  why, it's an artificial snow shaker.  this controls it.    wow, it's like being at the north pole.    yeah.  : here.  how will you get him to explain it to you.  i'm a genius. he's a monkey.  watch.  hey.  that looks like a simple yellow ornament, doesn't it.  uhhuh.  but if you look close...  it's saturn.  ah.  things aren't always what they seem to be.  like this.  it looks like a circle, but i think it's something more.  if only someone could tell me what.    of course.  i should know all about it.  uhhuh.    monkey one, genius nothing.  ah.  george thought the fake snow looked nice now, but how much better would it look turned up all the way.  man: oh, george.  uh, george.       he's... sorry.   sorry.  he revealed a flaw in the system.  george, maybe you should work here helping me.   uhhuh.   boy, wouldn't it be fun to have a snow shaker like this, george.  ooh. uhhuh.  that was exactly the kind of hint george was hoping for.   whwhere are you going.    well, we could try running this through a universal translation program.  oh... yeah.   whoa.  i'm sorry if we worked it too hard.  oh, it's okay.  computers crash.   yeah, i...  i've just never seen one burst into flames like that.    why don't we get any normal calls.    this was going to be the perfect surprise.  man: george.   okay, george, bedtime.   what.  aah.   oh, um... snow shaker... for me.  uhhuh.   finding a perfect gift that a monkey could make wasn't as easy as it sounds.   hi.  i still haven't been able to write a song for aunt margret.  the pageant is only a few days away.  ha anything i think of is already in a christmas carol.   betsy, i solved your problem: a christmas song unlike any other.   oh, aunt margret walked back home    carryg some cookies    i looked out of my window and    i said lookielookie.    but that's not about christmas.  they're christmas cookies.   oh, i'll keep thinking.  charkie.   george hoped betsy would find a song in time.  christmas preparations kept george and the man with the yellow hat very busy.   ooh.    um, george.      huh.  hey.   looking for these, george.    .. ha.    ooh.   oh, thank you.   and thank yo too.    the days were flying by so fast that george hadn't found time to figure out what to make for his friend.  oh.  and neither had the man.  it's almost here.  what can i do.  wiseman : why not follow george.  maybe he'll go somewhere that'll gi you the answer.  that's it.  you are a genius.  that's, um, actually my job description.  yes, it is.  thanks, good night.   george, i have a lot of places to go today, so i'll see you at dinner.  oh...  maybe he'd go somewhere that'd give george an idea for a present.   i bet he went into dulson's to look at toys.  my problems are solved.  oh.    ooh...  huh.         george, don't climb up there.  : ohnow he knows i'm here.      well, hi.  uh, what a coincidence that we're both in the same store.   i mean, what are the odds.    i guess i'll get going now.   see you.   okay. )
