smells, where you can buy bread, and people bake here.  so did you guess where i am.  yes. a bakery, and it's loaves of fun.   this program was made possible by: that shoes are designed for kids to be

man with the yellow hat's country house was always fun.   99 big yellow hats on the wall    99 big yellow hats    if one of those hats should happen to fall    98 big yellow hats on the wall    23 big yellow hats on the wall    23 big yellow hats    if one of those hats should happen to fall    one big yellow hat on the wall.   being in the country meant even more fun seeing jumpy squirrel...   ...and visiting everyone at renkins' farm, including mrs. renkins.  good morning, george.   tracy the hen...   and her six chicks.      tracy taught her chicks to walk tall and be proud like a chicken.        it was time for a bath because, in being proud like a chicken, neatness counts.  george.  would you come here, please.  uhhuh.   the neighbors will be here soon for our monthly game lunch, so i need you to run to the store.  okay.  we're out of toothpicks.  it's not a party if you don't pick up small food with toothpicks.  uhhuh.  oh, we need marshmallows, too.  and a new deck of cards.  you... you got some jelly on the old deck.  oh.   so take this list to ada and luke's general store, okay.  uhhuh. uhhuh.   be a good little monkey.  uhhuh.  meanwhile, tracy found a place that looked perfect for cleaning chicks.     uhoh.    the chickswantedto go to their mother when she called...  but they couldn't get back to her the way they came.    tracy couldn't get tothemeither.   after careful study, tracy determined there was no way to get on or off that island.  the youngest chick, al, was proud that he had found a way to get there.     now al was stuck, too.  ada and luke's store was a great place.  they gave free pickles.    that sounded like a chicken in trouble.  huh. ah.   george could see those six chicks needed to be rescued.   ah... aha.   george took two because it seemed safest.  that left four on the island.  tracy was so happy she'd have kissed him, but chickens don't have lips.  huh.   unfortunately, the chicks enjoyed being rescued by george too much to do it just once.  so now he had six chicks to rescueagain.  oh.   huh.  they didn't need a rescue ferry.  what they needed was a way to cross back and forth for fun.  aha.  they needed a bridge.  this looked like a good bridge.  but it was too short.  oh.    george was getting so hungry, it was hard to think.   he couldn't think of any way to make a branch longer.  hey.   ah.  he could makethislonger.    but could chicks walk on it.   : uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.  he needed something...  wide and flat.  ah.  aha.  ah...   heeheehee.  now he just had to repeat the same pattern until it was long enough.  am i the first one here. ooh.  are you making cocktail wieners.  yep.   no toothpicks.  it's not a proper party if you don't pick up small food with toothpicks.  i know, bill.  george will be back any minute with plenty of toothpicks.   george had made a bridgebut was it long enough.   uhhuh.  now all the chicks had to do was walk across.       the bridge wasn't chicksafe yet.   what could he do to make it safer.  hmm...  that bridge had sides made from triangle shapes.   hohohaha.  hey.  eh, eh, eh.    george suggested they cross one at a time...  in case the bridge wasn't strong enough to hold them all.   uhuhuhuhuh.  but the bridge was plenty strong.  it even held a whole hen.   a job well done.   george could now rush home with the marshmallows, toothpicks and cards.    mm, maybe not straight home.  : that must be some party if you need more marshmallows, toothpicks and cards already.   now it's officially a party.  mm, mmm.  all righty.  we're gonna play "go fish," yeah.     mama. come see what the chickens built.  they are geniuses.  we'd better start looking at colleges.  and that's how the renkins' college fund for gifted chickens got its start.   girl: george is a monkey, girl: george is a monkey, so sometimes he does things that you can't do.  boy: he made a bridge for chicks and a hen.  today we're making a bridge like curious george did.  we're using the red candy and toothpicks.  girl: you have to have the right materials.  it's too long.  breaking, breaking.  what's starting to happen to this bridge.  it's coming down.  has anyone ever noticed something different about bridges that's different than the bridge that we see here.  they're not flat like that, they're thicker like that.  think about building up to add strength.  one team used a triangular shape...  girl: so it can be stiff.  woman: and so we'll put one marble in at a timeto see how strong your bridge is.  kids: 44, 45, 46.  our bridge held 46 marbles.  that was a lot.  if that is hard to do, imagine a real bridge.  narrator: the man with the yellow hat was glad he had a friend like george to help carry his work...  because he needed both hands free to do this.     aw...  and he'd been doing it more often every day.   you're here.  uh, but you don't have the mcguffin foundation report.  aha.  thank you, george.   mmhmm.  mmhmm, yeah.  uhhuh. yes.  mmhmm.  oh, oh, oh.  good, good, good.   uh, i hope it's all okay.  i'm no scientist.   sorry.  : my, it doesn't take a scientist to know you caught a cold.  make sure he goes straight home to bed and gets plenty of rest, okay.  okay.   wait, wait, george.  they have to read the report first.  wiseman: oh, go home.  we'll call if we need changes.    the man with the yellow hat always took care of george.  now it was george's turn to take care of him.   "hey."  no, george, ii don't want to go to bed.  i'm gonna mail these letters...      okay, you win.   : i'll be good as new in the morning.    man: this is peter.  shh.  we, uh, read the report, and we need you to make some changes right away.   shh.  oh, your cold soundsmuchworse.  now, don't strain your voice, just listen.  switch chapters two and seven, move five before three, rotate every chart 90 degrees clockwise and anything blue make it orange, okay.  uh...  oh, and we need that done today.  drink plenty of water and fruit juice.  it helps you beat a cold.  oh, ah...  aha.  if the man with the yellow hat should drink plenty of juice and water, george would bring him two times plenty so he'd get better faster.  who was on the phone, george.  i don't know.   ah...  drinking fluids is good for a cold.  : you're one smart little monkey.   george was happy he'd done everything he could to help the man get better.   when i misplaced my brain, they said i was hopeless, but now i'm almost normal, thanks to you, dr. mcshpritzy.  don't thank me.  you're getting better fast because of the care you get here at handsome general hospital.  ah...  if george gave the man with the yellow hat the same care as a hospital, he'd get better fast.  tv announcer: handsome hospitalwill return after these messages.   oh.   huh. i was sleeping so soundly, i forgot i was sick and...  uhhuh.  huh.  wha.... where....  when....    oh, for a second, i thought i woke up in the hospital.   you know george, if you really want to help me, go to the drug store and get me some of this cold medicine.  oh. okay.   man: and please mail those letters.  okay.   george almost forgot to mail those important letters.  hi.  hiya, george.  running errands.  uhhuh.  did he give you a note, as usual.  uhhuh.  hey.   george must have accidentally mailed the note.  how could he get what the man with the yellow hat needed now.  he had to demonstrate what was wrong with the man with the yellow hat.    you need something for a blowfish.   sniffles.   big sneeze.  finger in the nose..  runny nose.  uhhuh.  a cold. you need something for a cold.   ugh... thank you so much, george.  i hope this works.  what else did you get.  a hot water bottle.  antisnore strips.  a hard pretzel.  hey.  the man with the yellow sleep cap took the medicine and went back to sleep.  and he slept a long time.     shh. shh.  ooh. you sound worse than i thought.  now, i know you're working hard on those changes, but we need to change the changes.  yeah. no, no...  yes, turn the charts counterclockwise.  turn the odd numbers even and replace 26 with 19, five and two.  we need it done by 8:00 a.m. okay.  yeah.  and remember, you'll feel better if you feed a cold and starve a fever.  huh. hey.  to make sure his friend got really well, george would feed that cold plenty.     oh. hi, geor.  wow, that's a lot of food.  before i eat any of that...  huh.  george wondered what he'd put in his mouth.  was he already feeding his cold.  huh.   oh, this is a thermometer.  it helps to tell if i have a fever.  huh.  yeah. normal is 98.6 degrees.  i have a very slight fever of 99.2 degrees.  george had to starve a fever.  wha....  ahhahaha.  oh, well.  i guess i'll figure it out when i feel better.     hi, george. know anyone who wants a kitten.  shh.  shh.  is somebody sick.  uhhuh.  oh, sorry.  when my best friend's cat, fluzzy, was acting sick, we all had to be quiet, just like that.   fluzzy stayed in bed a long time.  oh. uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.  oh.  the man with the yellow hat was in bed a long time.   and fluzzy didn't act like her normal, playful self.  the man wasn't acting like hisnormal, playful self.  he must have exactly the same thing fluzzy had.    but fluzzy wasn't really sick.  after laying in bed a whole day, she had six kittens.   kittens.   he wasn't sick.  the man with the yellow hat was going to have kittens.  if you know anyone who wants a kitten, send them to me.  george had to get the apartment ready for kittens.  by morning...  george had the place ready.     huh.  what.  hello.  woman: hi, it's professor wiseman.  it turns out your report's perfect.  we don't need any of those changes.  oh, ch... changes.  i'll make sure you get a bonus for doing all that difficult, extra work while you were so ill.  i didn't do anything.  oh, you're so modest.  thanks again.   changes.  oh, boy.  milk.  george.  meow, meow.  meow.  why are you meowing.  diddid i miss something.  huh.  ahh.  george was very happy the man got healthy without having kittens.    uhoh. sounds like you caught my cold.  come on, get to bed.    having a cold wasn't such a bad thing.  at least he wasn't having kittens.  kid 1: george is a monkey, so he can do things we can'tge is a monkey, so he can do things we can't do.  girl: he tried to help the man with the yellow hat feel better.  today, we are visiting dr. shiva barton.  he's a naturopathic doctor.  barton: instead of using medicines, we use natural therapies.  girl: naturopathy is another way to help you feel better.  see if you guys can tell me what it is.  it smells like rosemary.  it's oregano.  oregano is a spice that you find in spaghetti sauce and pizza.  oregano seems to be helpful for fighting germs.  he showed us a chart of the pressure points on our body.  barton: this is a pressure point if you have a tummy ache or for seasickness, and you can just rub that.  sometimes it helps.  naturopathic doctors also help people to stay well.  eat right, exercise, sleep well and have fun.  announcer:
