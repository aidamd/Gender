summer day in the country.  a perfect day for kiteflying with bill.  faster.  but bill was busy yelling at a mound of dirt.  you can do it.  show 'em what you got.  george was pretty sure that a mound of dirt wouldn't move no matter how much you encouraged it.   hi, george.   being a city kid, you probably don't race worms, huh.   they're in there, burrowing.  oh.  first one to dig its way out wins.   freddy's in the lead.   all right.  fast freddy wins again.  isn't he a beaut, george.  george.  george went to find his own racing worms.  and he knew just where to find them.  sometimes they were under the damp leaves in the shade.  ah.   sometimes he would find them hiding just below the soft earth by the roses.  huh..   ah...  ah.  wow, that sure is a biggie, george.   and he's sure got a lot of wiggle power.  look at all those segments.  huh.  worms' bodies are divided into little sections called segments, which are like muscles that help them to burrow in the soil.  oh....   so what are you going to do with your new worm, george.   you want to race fast freddy.  yeah. uhhuh.  the proper way to have a challenge race is on neutral territory, not in any racers' home yard.  so bill and george took their worms to neutral territory: lake wannasink lake.  on your mark.  get set.  go, worms.   go, freddy, go.  wow, who's winning.   go, freddy.  dig, dig, dig.  go, uh...  what's george's worm's name.  oohooh aahaah.  oh. okay.  : go, worms, go.  i can't stand the suspense.  faster.    go, um...  oohooh aahaah.  : aahaah.  go, freddy, go.  here comes fast freddy.   and the winner is...  both: oohooh aahaah.  wow.  city slang.  the winner is george's worm, by a segment.  : yay, george.  oohooh aahaah.  oohooh aahaah.   what are you doing, george.  oh, digging for more worms, i see.  ooh.   well, it's time to wash up for lunch.  oh... ah....  george had the perfect place to keep his pet worms.   um, thatcouldwork.   except worms need to dig.  and i don't think they can dig through your sheets, george.  huh.  what you need is a worm farm.   that's a special place to keep worms.  something covered so they won't get too hot from the sun.  oh...  wow.  guess you'll be trading one treasure for another, eh, matey.  argh.  now you need to fill it with what worms like best.   uhhuh, uhhuh.  rotting leaves, good thinking.  garden soil.  excellent choice.  coffee grounds will make the soil rich and airy.  that's right, george, add water and stir.  and some airoles for breathing now just add worms.   wow.  hey, george.  huh.  big worm race at lake wannasink lake.  bring your racer.  bet you can't beat mr. wiggly.  worm fever had spread throughout the countryside.  come on, go.    go. go. go.  go, worms, go.   ah, that's my worm.  yeah.  go, worm.  george had raced every worm in the valley.  only mrs. quint stood between him and being champ.  mr. wiggly is the best digger in my garden.  wow. he sure is a big one.  uhhuh.  that's because i feed my worms veggies, and in return, they make my soil better, and that makes better veggies in my garden.  since all you cheering worm racers scare the fish at the lake, i'm goin' fishin' in the river.  don't forget your lunch, dear.  yeah.  come on, guys. it's time for the championship race.  all: worm race. worm race.  worm race. worm race.  we're ready when you are, george.     oh, no.  mr. quint took your worms instead of his lunch.   i'm starved. i wonder what the missus packed for me this time.  worms.  well, the missus packed me some prime bait.  now, that there is love.   uhoh.  there was no time to lose.    : catfish.   george. come here.  that's a good monkey.  well, hey, is that my lunch box.  uhhuh.  oh, then this must be your worm farm.  uhhuh.  good timing, i must say.    dig, mr. wiggly, dig.  and the new wormracing champ is...  uh, uh, you know, george's worm.   with the championship won, george felt his worms deserved to retire to the garden and help the roses grow.   oohooh aahaah.  worm racing isn't the only sport in town.  you'll find a new hobby.     hey, george, ready for the froghopping race.   boy: george is boy: george is a monkey.  he filled his worm farm with soil, leaves and things that worms need.  girl: we were seeingwhich worm will go in which pile.  girl 2: we had sand, mud, soil and gravel.  you have to be very careful when you pick up worms.  first we made predictions.  i think it might poke its head at the sand and then turn around.  boy: the sand is a bit too rocky, i think.  i think the worm will go to the soil.  i agree with hayden, it's not too wet and not too dry.  and i don't think he'll go to the gravel because the rocks are so big and it's not wet at all.  the worm went into soil, and then it went to the mud and it stayed there for a little while.  because he was relaxed there.  boy 2: worms like wet places.  i think the worm likes the mud and the soil the best.  narrator: another day, another bag of trash.  wait.  that trash is not trash.  huh.  we need to separate our recyclables from genuine trash.  the city's having a contest.  the apartment building collecting the most recycling wins the golden triangle award.  whoo.  so, recycle, george.  it'll make the planet and our trash a lot neater.  recycling sounded like something george would want to help with...  hmm.  ...once he found out what it was.  uhhuh.  recycling can make those bottles and jars in the trash into new bottles and jars.  without it, they just pile up in garbage dumps and take up space all over the planet.  oh...  hey, you want to go to the recycling center and see exactly how it works.    we're making an impressive start.   hello, lydia.  oh, hello.  i lost a bottle there.   every little bit counts.    she must really want to win this contest, hundley.  she wouldn't even let one bottle get away.   hi. he wants to see recycling in action.  well, who knew recycling was catching on with monkeys.  i like it.   this triangle on the bottom of a container means it can be recycled.  huh...  first, containers need to be separated then cleaned.   glass is broken into bits...  then melted down to make new containers.  plastic works the same way.  recycled newspaper makes new newsprint.  think you're ready to start recycling.  uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.  now you can help with the contest.   three cans and it's not even noon.  i bet lydia hasn't even gotten a bottle cap.  huh..    three cans. all right.    oh, maybe it'snotgoing so well.  hmm.  if their doorman needed recycling, george was ready to get to work.  but nothing was empty.  huh.  hey.  filling up the almostempties meant more stuff for recycling.    ooh...  yeah.    what is it, boy.   haha. and we were feeling discouraged.      huh.  george didn't know there was an even bigger bin for recycle.  if he could find enough recycling to fill it, the doorman would win the contest for sure.  aha.   oh, my, my, you'll be filling that dumpster in no time.  boy, that doorwoman is so competitive.  it's clear she'll do anything to win this contest.   the next morning, george went hunting for more recycling.  hey...  oh. heeheeheeha.  aha.    haha.   oh.  aha.   ah... ha.  i think we're in good shape to win this contest, hundley.  i think that would be wonderful.  you do.  the more buildings where tenants recycle, the better.  and maybe you could start some reuse programs like we have.  want to see.  sure.   we reuse everything we can think of.  shopping bags.  magazines.  we never throw out packing peanuts.  it's so... organized.  anything to make the planet a little neater.      oh.  : oh...  you really have collected a lot.  have i.  uh, i mean...  ihave.  nobody got their newspapers this morning. weird.  there you are.  we have a food thief in the building.  i got a grocery delivery, and someone took half of it.  what..   someone took my paint pails.  how can i mix paint with no pails.  where are the wiki pizza coupons.  they're always on the front table.  huh.    : my shampoo.  my pails.  i need my pails.  i don't understand.  what..  pizza coupons.  hmm.     oh, boy.  : george.  those things are unused.  : did you take them just to win the recycling contest.  no. i don't understand.  i don't know how they got here.  recycling is about saving the planet, not winning a shiny trophy.  oof course.  i don't know how these extra papers and containers got here.   hey. aha.   how can i mix paint...   man: i thinkiknow where the extra recycling came from.  : uh, george, you recycle things afteryou use them.  huh.  oh.   people need to read their papers and eat their foodfirst.  thenthey go in the recycling bin.  ah...  eh.  why, thank you, george.   since some of our recycling was, uh... unfairly obtained, i think the best thing is for us to share.  oh.  that is so sweet.    doorwoman: after you're done, you can come and polish my trophy.  we may have tiedthisyear, but next year will be another story.  oh, yes. our building will win outright.  oh,really.  yes. we've already ordered larger bins for every floor.  really.  hmm...  : that's not recycling, george.    man: george is a monkey, ngs you can't do.  he was trying to recycle stuff before it was used.   our school does recycle and does reuse.  reuse and recycle.  it means you're thinking about the environment.  our school has a recycling program, and we collect the recycling bins each week.  reusing means using something again after you've used it once.  we're reusing these pizza boxes to make our plants grow.  then, we put dirt in them, and we planted seeds.  we reused this bottle to water our plants.  we made holes in the cap with a tack.  girl: we used rainwater that we collected from outside.  this person is not recycling, so the world turns to garbage.  this person recycled, so the world is happy.  help me out.  here are the eyes.  and i think they go here.  no. no.  oops. no. they go up here.  and below we're going to put the nose.  now, what goes down here on the bottom.  the mouth. the mouth.  right. the mouth.  hey, it's curious george.  and you can play more gameswith him at pbskids.org.  coming up next, explore
