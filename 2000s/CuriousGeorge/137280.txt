nbc/universal ooh, ah.  narrator: george was enjoying his absolute favorite dream.   it put him in the mood for grapes.  man: grapes. grapes.  get your big, green, juicy grapes right here.  ooh.   ooh. ah.  it's a new farmer's market, george.  you ready to do some shopping.  uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.  great.  : ooh.  ahh...    hey.   hundley was not enjoying all these people messing up the front of his building.  okay, george, here's the plan.  george. right.  you disappear.  i'll do the shopping and catch up with you later.  man: grapes, get your big, green, juicy grapes right here.   want to sample my grapes.  oh.  sorry, george.  but try some.  they're extra juicy.   man 2: if you like juicy, there's nothing juicier than actual juice.  try the most delicious drink u'll ever drink, courtesy of me, juicy jay.  it's got five fruits and vegetables.  oh.  plus a special secret ingredient.   that was the best drink george ever drank.   here you go.  george, wait'll you see all the stuff i bought.   well, okay, but just one sip.  i'm not very thirsty.  hmm.   ahh. whew.  can i have two more.  you sure can.  oh.   that's some juicer you've got there.  second best invention in the world.  the first is my tasty health drink.     i know these are delicious, but we should save the rest for later, george.  well, okay. i think that's later enough.    mmm.  boy, that was tasty.  uhhuh.  are you thinking what i'm thinking.  huh.   right, let's go.   hey.  where'd everybody go.  everybody packed up and left already.  huh.  but don't worry.  they'll be back next week.  huh.  huh.   a whole week without juice.  what was george going to do.  you know, george, if we had our own juicer, we could make the drink ourselves.   there's a kitchen supply store right around the corner.  let's go.  yeah.  oh, boy.  i have no idea how to use this.  but when in doubt, read the... instructions.  hmm.  i guess there are no instructions.  oh.  well, don't worry.  between a smart man and a smart monkey we should be able to figure it out.   hello.  what..  i'll be right there.  sorry, george.  professor wiseman needs me at the museum.  they're picking a new shade of yellow for the main hall.  i'll be back as soon as i can.    ooh.  george figured a smart monkey all by himself should be able to work this thing.    now, what did juicy jay say he put in that drink.  it's got five fruits and vegetables, plus a special secret ingredient.  five fruits and vegetables.  all of them seemed to be red.  hmm.  apples are red.  and peppers.  and strawberries.  ooh.  and watermelons.  ahh.  george didn't know what cabbage was, but it was the last red thing in the fridge.  five red things.  oh...  now, all george needed was a special ingredient.    hmm.  a red fish.  why not.     okay.  so maybe raw fish is not a special juice ingredient.  george decided he'd try again, and make a fishfree juice.  he started with one of everything: one apple, one strawberry, one pepper, one piece of watermelon and one whatever this was.     that wasn't it at all.  he had the red ingredients.  hmm...  what could be the problem.    george decided to experiment with different amounts of each ingredient.  he used a big piece of paper to keep track.   hmm.  ahh...    not berry enough.  so george added strawberries.  ugh.  too sweet.  george added more peppers.   it still wasn't right.  and it certainly didn't pass the hundley test.   maybe george needed more of... these things.  close, but george thought more apples might help.  yay.  george's juice was perfect.  well, almost.  it still needed a special secret ingredient.  huh...  where could he find one of those.  ah.  pisghetti: hello, giorgio.  say, can i interest you in today's special.  special.  that's exactly what he was looking for.  it's eggplant piccata, with extra amounts of piccata.  oh...  oh, those are radishes.  try one.  try one.  oh...  oh, but careful.  radishes are a little, eh...speziato.  that means "spicy."  radishes were spicy.  but spicy might be good in a drink.  ooh.   i know.  help yourself, giorgio.   just the radishes.  uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.  byebye.  byebye.  george hoped that one radish would do the trick.  ah.  george had done it.  his juice was just as good as juicy jay's.  better, even.  george.  oh, no.  hi.  oh, have you been making juice.  uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.  mmm. oh, oh, my goodness, this juice is amazing.   yeah.  george thought his juice was so delicious he decided to give it away at the next farmer's market.  get your "george juice." it's made with apples for strong bones, cabbage for vitamin c and a bunch of other healthy stuff.   oh, thanks.  oh.  this is fantastic.  can i get the recipe.  sure.  george started with your juice, but added a few new ingredients.  uhhuh, uhhuh.  a radish..  oh, that is brilliant.  a revolution in juicemaking.  to george and his delicious george juice.  yahoo.  girl: george is a monkey.  he used different amounts of ingredients to make his own really good juice.  today we are making juices out of different fruits and vegetables.  this is a juicer similar to what curious george was using.  boy: mei is making carrot juice.  i'm making spinach juice.  oh, yeah.   girl: patrick is using a simple orange juice squeezer.  boy: the juice goes through these holes and then the pulp can't go through the holes 'cause it's too big.  these juices have vitamins, minerals and other healthy stuff.  girl 1: each kid is coming up with their own recipe.  girl 2: one half of a banana, three scoops of lemon and four scoops of papaya.  for the banana recipes, we have to use the blender because the banana doesn't work well in the juicer.  it tastes a little bit sour and a little bit sweet.  for this recipe i'm going to use only green and brown juices.  yummy.  four scoops of lime, one scoop of spinach, four scoops of celery and two scoops of apple juice.  it tastes sour, and it tastes really bad.  girl: that's four scoops of carrot, five scoops of tomato and two scoops of spinach.  it's really good.   it's healthy and it's yummy.  narrator: of all the birds george loved to visit at the aviary, the cerulean warbler was his favorite.   which is why today was so important to him.  well director, here's the book.  everything you ever wanted to know about the cerulean warbler in just 1,400 pages.   very impressive.  uhhuh, uhhuh.  i want everyone to know that the warbler is endangered.  there aren't many left.  hopefully, this will do the trick.  oh, a book like this will help get the word out.  how's it selling.  uh, not so well.  we were hoping you could give them to all the bird lovers who come here to the aviary.  uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.  sure. how many.  um, just a...  few...  hundred.  well, it's a very important topic, so i'll see what i can do.  thanks.  man: i have another plan for spreading the bird word, george.  i'm meeting today with lance libro.  he owns a big chain of book stores.  and you know what i'm going to say.  huh.  "mr. libro, the cerulean warbler needs your help.  you must carry my book."  oh, boy.  narrator: later that morning, george wastill thinking about the warbler...   ...and the fact that their bathtub was filled with books.  steve: lemonade.  get your free lemonade.  huh.  ah.  say, can i have another.  mmm, gosh, this is wonderful.  the best ever.   hey, george.  you know why they call me the "the lemonade king".  uh... uhuh.   mmmmm. ahh...  free samples.  once people try this stuff, they're hooked.  they can't get enough, and they bring back their friends.  mmm, this is the best ever.  i'll take two, please.  wow. sure.  ah... oh.  that gave george an idea.  if people got free samples of the man's book, maybe they'd give some to their friends, too.  that'd be a great way to spread the bird word.  ooh. ahh...  what you got there.  ah, the man's warbler book.   with each lemonade you're going to give a free book.  in business, we call that a twoforone.  can't miss.    but not everyone who wanted lemonade wanted a book.  either it didn't fit on a bicycle...   ew.  ...or it was too yellow...  aw.  ...or they didn't know how to read.    another great sales day for the king. )
