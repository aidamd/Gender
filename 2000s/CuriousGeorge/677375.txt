anniversajubilaria.   this is the anniversajubilaria.  it's as old as the town100 years.  ooh.  we bring it out once a year at the town's anniversary party.  one star has been added to it every year since the town was founded.  yeah. that's the one we just addednumber 100.  ooh. uhhuh. uhhuh.  were there reallya hundred stars.  george decided to count them.  one, two, three, four, five six, seven, eight, nine, 10.  ten stars.  uhbut he had one problem.  remember how to count to 100.  uhuh.  well, you just counted to 10, so if you count to 10 10 times, that's 100.  ooh. uhhuh.  so how many stripes are there.  one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10.  ten rows. each row has 10 stars. that's 100.  all the stars were in nice rows.  ah.  all except one.  george could fix that.  in a moving car.  can you imagine.  it took the town a hundred years to complete that.    oh.   folks will go absolutely wild...  when they see all hundred stars on the anniversajubilaria.  how wild would they gowhen they sawnostars.  george had to tell the manabout what happened.   just the guy we need. can you come help with the costumes.  sure. george, do you mind staying here and helping with the anniversajubilaria.  uhthanks.  oh.  george would need to fixthe anniversajubilariahimself...  before anyonewas disappointed.   a good place to startwas where the stripesflew out of the car.  and it was.  yeah.  uhhuh.  he quickly found two.   oh.   ah.  oh.   whoa.  ah.   ah.  aha.  and there was a fourth.    huh.  good old jumpy.  he'd understandgeorge needed this.   but jumpy didn't care.  he wanted it.    george didn't want to rip it.   no squirrel could resista threeforone trade.  yeah.  four stripes.this was going well.  george was a good searcher.  ha.  he found two more.  now he had six.   getting all the stripeswas going to be easyfor this clever monkey.  whoa. ooh.   oh.  now the river had six,and george had none.     yeah.  ooh.     he didn't want tolose these again.  this was the safest placefor them.  the anniversajubilaria will now be unveiled after the band plays.  that's earlier than planned.  earlier.  time was running out.    ah.  those weren't table runners.they were missing stripes.  george added two stripesto the six he'd already found.   so now he had eight stripestwo more to have all 10.  george, i've been looking for you.   it's time for the town founding play.  you're in it, remember.  oh, yeah.   let's give a warm welcome to our town founders.   all george could think aboutwas where to look forthose two last stripes.  this looks like a fine place to live and farm, and let us found a town here...  and name itoh, my word.  so the original name of this town was...  oh, my word.  george already hadeight stripes.  one more made nine.  now he only had to findone more stripe.   now the anniversajubilaria will be unveiled even earlier, right after the kite flyin'.  uh.  after the kite flying.when was the kite flying.  oh.  it was now.george had no time left.  hey, george, did you see my kite.  i found a great tail on the ground right in the yard.   there it was.  when allie reeled in her kite,everything would be okay.   look, an eagle.   it's flying away with my tail.   it must want it for its nest.  the eagles have a nest on top of mount neverclimb.  do you know why they called it mount neverclimb.  uhuh.  because no one could ever climb it.  oh.  so how could a little monkeyget up there.  ah.    bye.   in just a minute, we'll be unveiling the anniversajubilaria, now with 100 hardearned stars.    ten stripes

adventuresaresupposed to be full of surprises.  whoosh, clank. ha.  betsy, steve, time to go.   you want us to stop playing right at the exciting part.  well, that means tomorrow you'll start playing right at the exciting part.  hey, that's right.  george didn't want to messeverything up by cleaning.  but he knew that you couldn'tleave toys on the floor.  someone could get hurt.  before we go, help george clean up.  it took so long to set all this up, we never got to find out how our highstakes adventure ended.  hmm.   george thoughtall night about how he couldkeep his toys set up.  the next d,betsy and steverushed over to play.  ah.  let's set up as fast as we can. no time to waste.   he already did it.  it's not as big, but it's also not on the floor.  does that mean we don't have to spend time putting it all away.  uhhuh. you're so smart.  why couldn't i have had a monkey instead of a brother.  you guys will never escape. clank. clank.  there's no escape.  but george had an idea.   whoosh.     oohooh. aah.  fearless georgehad to think fast.  ah.  ooh.  okay. now we're tied to the robot.   ha. you'll never get the one.    i'm sorry.  huh.  i thought it would be okay to set up out here, but it turns out aunt augusta is coming over for tea, so i'll need to use the table.  oh, man. okay.  oh.that was too bad.  where else could georgeset up the toys.    balcony. great idea.  i'll help you set it up out there.  you can leave it as long as you want.  yay.  this is great, george.  we don't have to waste a lot of time building it and then putting it away.    whoa.  whoa.  it's a long way to those trees. yeah.  oh.  whoa.     ah.    a polar bearwith a suitcase...  the same sizeas the one of ones.  hmm.this needed investigation.   where'd all this water come from.   uhrain. get everything inside.   maybe we should give up. uhuh.  george didn't want to give up.  his missionset the toys upsomewhere out of the way.  that evening,george and the man stoppedat mabel's department store.  uh, do you have these yellower.  mmm.george wondered...  if the store might havea solution to keeping his toysout of the way.  hmm.  a vacuum might pick them up.  ah, hmm.   but then again, maybe not.  ah.  a rug might cover his toys.  d'oh. george.   ooh. you'll be amazed how easily...  it fits right back underneath the bed.  hmm.  aha.  that's what george needed.and it was simple.  he got plywoodfrom the basement, so he could put his toys on itand tuck them awayunder his bed.   ah.  uhoh.  the pyramid was too tall.  ooh.   ah. uhhuh.  now it was perfect.   huh.   oh.  how did this one moveso smoothly.  ooh.it rolled.  things that roll move smoothly.  george found things that roll.  balls rolleduhhuh.  right out.   and hockey pucks were no better.  uhhuh.   but train boxcarswere just right.   yay.  hi.  we want to do something for more than three minutes.  let's play catch. uhuh.   what are you doing, george.   tada.  wow. why didn't i think of that.  face it. you're no monkey.   the storm's over.   he'd found it.the missing one.     that's the world's crankiest polar bear, guardian of the one.     ooh.    yikes. ooh.  stop him. i want the one.    stop. stop. give me the one.  no. give it to me. i want it. it's mine.   hey, slow down.can fearless georgeever get out of this.      yes.  with the aid ofhis loyal pterodactyl, hansel.   well, that was certainly an unexpected twist.  ooh.  he returned the missing oneto where it belonged.    another mission accomplished byfearless george, hero of heroes.   oh.  aha.  let's play again. this time, george is a wizard trapped on the south pole by penguins.  and if we run out of time, we just roll it under the bed.  yeah.  whether he was being a wizardor cleaning up toys, fearless georgewas up to any challenge.   ge george used wheelsto make a rolling board.  we are attaching wheelsto things to make them roll.  i had an idea to use this big, black crate.  first, helen had two wheelson the big milk crate.  it didn't work. it leaned to both sides.  if we just have it up on two wheels like that, it just tips over.  in a car, the wheels are in the corners.  so if we put them on the corners, it might work a little better.  that works much better. i gotta say, that was perfect.  this is andrew's vehicle.these are rollers.  we'll see how that goes.  it kept falling over.  let's go.  andrew's vehiclewas too skinny.  hey, andrew, why don't you use this box.  that works much better.  wheels are useful for many things.  yeah, it's fun to just make things roll around.  summersafari august.
