like curious...    like curious...curious george.   oh...  captioning sponsored byuniversal animation  narrator: it was a perfect day to explore lake wannasink lake.  bill called it "pictureperfect." you know, george, nature photography requires skill, patience and timing.    remember, george, to cross a log, you needexactfoot placement and a keen sense of balance.  oh...   : phew.  aha.   uh, those are tadpoles, george, a common form of pond life.  ah...  i guess a city kid like you never sees any realwildlife, huh.   hey.  why don't we take some back home and observe their growth.   while collecting tadpoles, both proper net control and collecting jar placement are crucial.  oh...  hey.  how'd you like to look out for them for me.  uhhuh.   do the tadpoles like the lettuce i boiled for them.   now, remember, i want you to watch them closely for me.  they do some amazing things as they grow.   keep them safe in that bowl, and they should be just fine.  and so on that gloriously sunny day, george became the proud caretaker of a bowl full of tadpoles.  ooh...      the tadpoles' bowl was small.  george thought they deserved to stretch their...  well, whatever a tadpole stretches, and decided to let them enjoy a quick swim in the lagoon while he went to get their lunch.   hey.  hey.    where could the tadpoles be.  what would he tell bill.    hey, george.  lagoon exploration is fascinating, isn't it.   oh, by the way, how are my tadpoles doing.  um...  see you soon.    time to go back to the city, george.   george hoped the tadpoles would be okay without a monkey to feed or protect them.   george.   look.  my caterpillar is in its pupa stage.  i bet kids like you never see that in the city, huh.   hey, have my tadpoles done anything amazing yet.   weeks went by before george returned to the lake.   george still couldn't find the tadpoles.  but they had to be in the lagoon.  unless...  ...they'd swum into the lake.  but the lake was much too big for a little monkey to swim around.     uh, whatcha doing there, george.  checking the water level or... washing your hair.   oh, yeah, there's a lot of fish in the waters round here.  uh, trout, salmon, haddock...   oh, uh, what.  oh, of course you can borrow it.  my gear is your gear.  ah...   instead of a blur, george now saw an exciting underwater world.  he couldn't believe his eyes.  had he finally found his tadpoles.  oh...  uh, just how big is this fish you're after, george.   : well, you might as well be hunting for tadpoles.   there you go, try this one.  ah.   george knew nothing about water beetles...  except thattheycouldn't help him find his tadpoles.   huh.  now, this was a strange creature.  it looked like a tadpolesort ofswam like a tadpolekind ofbut it had legs, almost no tailnot like a tadpole.   hey, george.  my tadpoles aren't giving you any problems, are they.   good. bring them over sometime for a visit, okay.  george knew that, someday, he'd have to tell bill he'd lost the tadpoles.  and he knew he might never see his little friends again.  back in the city, george tried to take his mind off the tadpoles.  it wasn't easy.   george couldn't believe it.  that odd little creature was one of his tadpoles.  and he let it go.   but, george, we just visited the lake.  we'll go back next month.  bill said the tadpoles would grow up in amazing ways.  but how much would they grow in a whole month.  and into what.  george, we've been looking all over for you.  you got, like, 800 pounds of boiled lettuce.  now george really had to get back to the lake...  ...but it was weeks before he could go.  luckily, george didn't see any signs of jumbo tadpoles...  ...but he couldn't find his friends either.    these loud frogs probably scared the tadpoles away.   it was time for george to tell bill he had lost the tadpoles.  hey, george.  that was a good idea to release my tadpoles into their natural habitat.  how did you like watching them grow into frogs.  pretty neat, huh.   uhhuh. just like my caterpillar changed into a butterfly.  see.  the tadpoles were right here all the time.  they had just been, well, growing up.  smile, george.  before long, george thought the frogs were even more fun than the tadpoles.    well, most of the time.  kid: george is a monkannkey, and he can do things we can't do.  kid 2: he thought he had lost the tadpoles, but they really had just changed.  man: this is the east middlesex mosquito control project.  this is a birdbath.  it's water that sits outside for a long period of time, and it collects things.  it becomes something that mosquitoes want to lay their eggs in.  when mosquitoes hatch out from their egg stage they become larvae, and then they break out of their larval skin and they become pupae before they break out of their pupal skin and then become adult mosquitoes, which is the mosquitoes that fly around.  can i see that.  there's some larvae in there. larva.  man: the mosquito larvae kind of wriggle through the water.  these things that are spinning right here are actually mosquito pupae.  pupae.  they're like these little slugs with...  they have antennae.  i know, they go...  boy: they don't look like adult mosquitoes yet, but they probably will be soon.  does anyone know what an entomologist is.  yes... no... no idea.  it's a person who studies insects... bugs.  man: doug needs to look at the mosquitoes under the microscope.  some spread diseases, and it's important for us to know what kind of mosquitoes there are.  i'm going to show you two different mosquitoes in here, all right.  girl: one had stripes and the other one was just blackishcolored.  we saw things we never saw before.  the apartment building where george lived was a very orderly place.  and that's how hundley liked it.  they're here to clean your carpets.  people came...  ...and people went.    the elevator arrived...  ...and people came down the stairs.  everything in hundley's lobby was orderly and neat.  well, almost everything.  we can't go back into the apartment until the carpet is dry, george.  so you stay here in the lobby while i run my errands.  all right.  okay. oh, oh, and in case you get hungry.  i won't be long.    hundley didn't think george should be eating a sloppy apple in the lobby.    george decided it would probably be better to eat his apple someplace else.  hundley had never been through this door before...  but he was pretty sure it was against the rules to be out here.    hundley didn't think george would ever get in that way, so he'd find a better way.    hmm.     all right, move it along.  hmm.  at least there was one thing hundley knew for certain: home was this way.  or maybe that way.   huh.     aha.     hundley was getting worried.  he could just imagine the terrible things that that sloppy monkey was doing to his lobby.  when hundley found his building, it was even worse than he imagined.   but then hundley saw that...  it wasn't his street at all.  huh.  but that meant he had no idea where he was.    lots more comin'stick around.  come on, guys, let's go.        huh.    they'd found each other at last.  time to go home.  but where was home.  george realized that finding someone works better if you're not lost, too.  hundley worried.  what if he never found his way back.   oh, hundley. what'll i do without hundley.    hundley and george weren't just lost.     they were lost at night.   they may not be able to see their way home, but maybe they could hear their way home.  huh.  george tried to remember the noisy stuff he'd passed.    here they were, lost at night, and all this monkey could do was... whatever that was.  then hundley had an idea.  they might not be able to see their way home, but maybe they could hear their way home.  he tried to remember what he'd heard.     oh.    now it was up to hundley's powerful dog ears.   that wasn't the right sound.  so the musician couldn't be in that direction.   that was either the wrong sound or the musician got his tongue caught in his trumpet.      hundley knew they were getting closer because the sound was growing louder and louder.  but then it grew softer and softer.    hundley tried to figure out how to explain they'd passed the sound.  but there are some things a dog just can't explain to a monkey.     shh.  and so, by working together as a team...  george remembering what they had heard...  ...and hundley using his sensitive, powerful dog ears...    ...hundley and george found their way back to the alley behind their home.  they were home, thanks to teamwork.  hundley couldn't remember why he ever thought george was trouble.  carpet cleaner: rugs all clean, sir.  you should see the dirt i picked up.  this barrel probably has the filthiest water in the world in it.  george really wanted to see the filthiest water in the world.  aha.     george: uhoh.        girl 1: george is monkey and he can d he can do stuff we can't do.  he wandered away from home and got lost.  kid 2: he found his way home by following sounds.  this is the west end house boys and girls club.  kid 3: what kind of sounds can we hear inourneighborhood.  we're gonna take a walk and then we're gonna stop...  ... and we're gonna listen.    i heard a car.  the car sounded like, "room, room, room...  vroom." we were on the street.  and now we're on the park.   i hear some birds, like, singing a song or something.   it sounds like a jungle.   i hear big trucks up there going hard on the ground.   they're over there fixing a new playground.  before, we're in a park. now we're in a busy street.   i hear a train.  i heard the bell.   the train was leaving.  the bell was going... dooooh.  room...  papapapapa.  rrrr....  whoot... whoot.  lly
