'cause we see all these science things and this is science, too.  so, we should put it there.  we're trying to organize it because we want to be able to find stuff.  and to be able to know what is what and where stuff is.  glue is a school supply.  we use coins for counting, so they go on the math shelf.  now, everything's really organized.    ah.  george was trying to get pictures of wild animals and their tracks.  but there weren't too many wild animals near his home.   ah.  so, he decided to go visit theirs.  ooh.  possums were hard to photograph.  george: ah...  because if they see you...  aw...  ...they play dead.  bullfrogs move too much, and they ruin their own tracks.  aah.   raccoon tracks were easy to find.    just don't bother a raccoon when it's busy.     thanks for helping me with the nature week exhibit, george.  uhhuh.  we'd like to see the tracks of all the animals that live around here.   the swim mask.  uhhuh.  oh, i'm going to go jump in the lake to conduct a nature week fish survey.  bye.  bye. oh...  george wished his photos were more exciting.  but there weren't many exciting animals around here.  hey, george.   what you doing.  wow. i see you've got almost every local animal except that fawn i've seen in the hills.  huh.  a fawn is a baby deer.  bet you don't see too many of them in the city, huh..  hmm.  a fawn was just the special unusual animal george was looking for.   come on. i'll show you where to find it.   going on an easy hike is the proper way to break in new boots.  did you know that.  uhuh.   : city kids.  this is where i saw the fawn.  well, time to get to work.   i have to work on the trail for nature week.   oh.   ah.     you're going to look for the fawn over there.  uhhuh.  if you finish up early, i'll be swimming, okay.   uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.  george followed tracks in search of the fawn.  but all he found was a slithery garter snake.    and ducks who had webbed feet...  like frogs.  which must be why they're both good swimmers.  and a fish, who didn't leave any tracks.  george still hadn't seen the fawn or learned what its tracks looked like.   these were the biggest tracks george had seen so far.  something extra large must've left them.  they looked like big duck tracks.   a big duck would make a terrific photo.  ooh, yeah.  this was like the long track the garter snake made.  a giant duck with a snake's tail would make an even better picture.   but a huge snake with duck feet, would be the most incredible photo of all.   whatever made these tracks had to be something special and unusual.   the strange tracks suddenly stopped.  huh.  did the duckfooted snake fly away.  ah.  or maybe it was because nothing could leave tracks in hard stone.  ah.  huh.  you can't leave tracks in water.  but you can make tracks with water.  uhhuh, uhhuh.   the animal must be going this way.     maybe it swam back home.  ah...  george remembered he'd seen big tracks like these.  aha.  in a book.  ah.  there they were.  dinosaur tracks.  a duckbilled dinosaur.  george got a photo of jumpy by leaving out food.  couldn't he do the same with a dinosaur.  what a prize photo that would be.   he didn't have any dinosaur food.  but maybe they would like fruits and vegetables.  hi, george.  hi, george.  george, i saw that fawn in the hills, but i couldn't find you.  hey, you coming swimming.  uhuh.  george was thinking about something bigger than a fawn.  much bigger.   ha, ha, h.  huh.    those tracks couldn't possibly belong to a meateating dinosaur, could they.   dohh.   whew.     huh.  could that be the dinosaur.       george decided to warn the man with the yellow hat that a hungry dinosaur might be visiting.     the dinosaur had returned from the water.   and the tracks were headed towards bill's house.   hiya, george.  did you see the fawn.     : yeah, i guess those do look like dinosaur tracks.  uhhuh.    : yep, my new boots were hurting my feet.  so, i put these on to walk to the lake.  i told you i was going swimming, remember.  uhhuh.  hey, now i know what it's like to walk in a dinosaur's footsteps.   with no hungry dinosaurs around, george still needed that special photo for nature week.   huh.  it sounded like jumpy was hungry again.  ah...  but george had enough pictures of that squirrel.    ah.  ooh.    for such big animals, those deer left pretty small tracks.  hey, deer tracks.  wow, you used fruit and vegetables to lure the deer to our house so you could take photos.   look at these wonderful deer. oh.  how did you manage to capture such amazing photos, george.  oh, you know george.  he just used his imagination.  isn't that right.  uhhuh.   child: george is a monkey.  he takes pictures of lots of different kinds of tracks.  curious george was looking at tracks and we're making tracks.  we're noticing that we're making footprints.  they're different 'cause they're different shoes.  my sandal has a heel right here.  and a lot of sandals doesn't.  now, we're going to make tracks, and the other kids have to guess how it was made.  i choose the bottom of a bottle.  i think they won't be able to guess because it's an odd shape.  it looks sort of like a flower but not exactly.  i think you made the tracks with one shell.  no.  you used a rock.  no.  oh. come on. a bottle.  i'm not doing really individual prints, i'm just rolling it mostly.  it was so hard to guess.  oh... maybe she took a rock or a shell and just stuck them in.  no.  this looks like a straight line.  that truck was making a track 'cause it rolls, and that's why it makes the line.  so, maybe she rolled something.  yes.  something with a point.  is it a pine cone.  yeah.  tracks can help you solve mysteries.   for more fun with curious george and
