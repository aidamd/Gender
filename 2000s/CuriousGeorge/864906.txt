curious george.   oh...  captioning sponsored by nbc/universal pretty city committee pod number seven, come to order.  narrator: george was honored when steve asked him to be part of his pod.  steve: as you know, the mayor has declared today city prettification day.  that's right, steve.  pods will be fanning out all over the city to pick up litter and, well, make the city pretty.  : right again, steve.  later this afternoon, i will pick a winner.  oohhoo. uhuh, uhuh, uhhuh.  pods will be judged according to the prettiness of their streets, the amount of trash they collect, and their cando spirit.  steve asked me to mention that the winning pod will get their picture on this "pretty city" poster.  ooh, ah.  ah. can't you just see my face...  i mean our pod plastered all over the city.   good luck pod seven.  i'll see you at 3:00 sharp for the judging.  i expect great prettification.  okay, everyone, you know your assignments.  let's go.  oh, i sure do.  i wrote it down in my "litter log." and does everyone have an official pretty city committee trash bag.  yeah.  uhhuh, uhhuh.   excellent.  then let's go make our city... pretty.   : seven, seven, that's our pod.  we're gonna do a super job.  george's assignment was to clean up his own street.  but george's street was already pretty pretty.   aha.   ooh.  ah.  uhhuh, uhhuh.  ooh.  man: hey.  hey.  you're welcome to take whatever you want.  just put what you don't want back in the boxes, okay.   well, at least george now had a job to do.   wait a minute.  aargh. aargh.  why would anybody throw out a pirate ship.  ooh...  even if it was a little broken.   george really wanted to keep it.  mm.  aha.  george decided to use one of his bags for trash and the other for treasure.  ooh.  oh. oh.  this heartshaped box was definitely treasure.  yeah.  he could use it to store pictures.   ooh.  aha.  keys.  they might unlock somethingreallyinteresting.  george found more things to add to his treasures.   uhhuh, uhhuh.  ah.  and what was that.  george didn't know, but it was shiny and it made a nice click.  yeah.    george also kept the square pig...  oh...  ...and the red bottle, which was the same color as the heart box.  ah.  and of course he couldn't throw out this painted...  whatever it was.   ah...  or the round glasses.    or the yellow daffodil.   george's sack of treasures filled up fast.   he needed to empty it.   whoa.   ooh. heh.  ah. oh, oh.   every monkey needs a blue watch.   ah.   ah.   and a couple of yellow ducks.    ah ah.    ooh.  george loved the man's pig collection.  oh. uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.  now he had a collection of his owna street treasure collection.   pod seven, line up.  um... where's george.  i don't see himbut his street looks clean.  mayor: you're right.  i've already checked your streets, and they do appear to be prettified.  now, the next step in the evaluation is to weigh the trash you have collected.  ten points for each pound of trash.  we really need george's trash.  every pound'll help.  well, maybe he went up to the apartment.  i'll take a look.    man: george.  are you in here.  we need your...  hi.   uh... george, why is your trash all over the floor.  huh.   one gum wrapper.  that's your trash.  uhhuh.  and this is....   stuff you want to keep.  uhhuh.  i see.  did you find george... wowee.  look at all this trash.  this'll earn us another 50 points, at least.  aah.    hmm, are you saying this is your collection.  uhhuh.  : well, george, a collection isn't just random stuff you find on the street.  a collection has to relate in some way, like a stamp collection or a coin collection, or my commemorative pig collection.    okay, you can keep some of this stuff.   but not all of it.  find some things that go together and make that your collection.  then put everything else in a bag and bring it downstairs, okay.   thanks.  hmm...  finding things that went together wasn't gonna be easy.  the pirate ship floated on water and was made of wood.   the duck floated on water, but it wasn't made of wood.  um, uh...  and the heartshaped box wouldn't float very well at all.  : oh....  aha.  what about a collection of round things.  he had a lot of those.  ooh...  but waitthat meant he'd have to throw out the ship.  ooh... uhuh.  ah.  well, since the boat was made of wood, george decided to have a wood collection.    oh.  but then he'd have to give up his watch.    hey.  there were blue things...  and things that were half blue, half green.  ah.  at last, george knew just what to do.  okay, it looks like we've weighed all the bags.  where's george.  we can't win without his trash.    uh, uh...   um, this bag is empty.  uhuh, uhuh.   um, george, is that the only thing that didn't fit into your collection.  uhhuh.  uh... there may be more trash upstairs, but i think we have to go see.  well, this is highly unorthodox, but... okay.  now, i have to warn you, the apartment may look a little messy, so...  tadah.  well, i'll be.  that is beautiful, george.  ah...   aunt margret: beautiful. oh, it's a work of art.  a color collection.  way to go, george.   and what better way to capture the cando spirit of pretty city day than to turn trash into something, well, pretty.   with your permission, i'd like to hang this in the city art museum.   in fact, i think that would ensure that pod seven, led by steve, will be on the "pretty city" poster.   mayor: i hereby declare that pod seven, led by steve, is the winner of the city prettification contest.    isn't it great, george.  my... uh, i mean,our picture on a poster.  thanks toyour work of art.   hey.  hey.  that looks like a number two carbon pencil stub.  nice yellow.   this was a good beginning of a whole new collection.  girl: george is a monkey.  he sorted all his treasures by color to make a collection.  today we are organizing objects using a venn diagram.  boy: a venn diagram is circles.  girl: a venn diagram can help you sort things.  teacher: team one sorted their solids into three different properties.  girl: hard things, blue things, and sphereswhich means: shaped like a ball.  this is hard, so it goes here.  this is blue, so it goes here.  these are hardandblue, so they go right here.  teacher: team two's properties are: if it can roll, if it's red or if it is heavy.  no, right here, 'cause it's heavy and it rolls.  and it's red, so it should go in the middle 'cause it's one of everything.   narrator: it was deep winter, a time when the whole world seemed snowy and cold.  here we are.  ah. oh...  but this year was the snowiest and coldest ever.  come on.  yay.  aah.      it was so cold...  that jumpy squirrel had decided to move indoors.  the house had everything.  it was warm, it was quiet, and, thanks to jumpy, it had lots of nuts.     oof.  itiscold in here.  let's turn up the heat.   the man and the monkey were back.   jumpy had to get out fast.   but no sooner was he out than he wanted back in.  luckily, jumpy had a lot of in and out doors.   now he just needed to sneak past the monkey.  huh.  but monkeys have very sharp ears.  george: huh.     oh.    oh, no.   hey.    well, i'll be.  hey.  we're gonna have to fix that.   there we go.  hi, george.   huh.   well, we can't leave holes in the house.  all the heat will get out.     nope, jumpy needs to stay outside.  there's more food for him out here.  he'll be happier in his own home.   what was that.   man: uhhuh.  yup.  your friend jumpy has been very busy.  oh.  no wonder the house is so drafty.   okay.  )     we have got to insulate this house.  heh.  "insulate." it means keep the warm air in and the cold air out.  okay, cold, ready or not, here we come.  first the man sealed around the windows.  oh.    yeah. the caulk is squishy, so you can fill the holes and keep cold air out.  you want to try.  uhhuh.    then he got ready to insulate the attic.   oh.   oh, this fluffy stuff.  that's celluloseit's insulation that fills up air pockets in the walls.  ah.   thanks, george.  man: okay, turn it on.   filling up these empty walls will keep even more heat inside.   jumpy thought it was the perfect time to sneak inside.     but he thought wrong.      well, i guess i'd should seal around the pipes, too.  but the quickest way to keep a house warm...  say, george.  ...is to keep the doors closed.  ooh.  ah. much better.  the man was rightit was much warmer inside.  but outside, it was colder than ever.     ah.  if he couldn't bring jumpy inside where it was warm...  he'd bring the warm outside to jumpy.     except trees didn't come with windows to seal.  hmm.  if squirrels lived in houses instead of trees, george would know exactly what to do.  and then george saw it.   it was the perfect squirrel house.  oh.  except it did have a lot of cracks.  so george caulked them.  ah...  now he needed some fluffy stuff.   eh.  but he was out of fluffy stuff.  : oh...  there we go.   aha.  the lint from the clothes drier would work just as well.   bye, george.    oh. oh.  huh. that is one fast lintcleaning monkey.   oh.  to kp fluffytuff stuff, george needed walls to hold it in place.  but where would he find squirrel walls.  ah.  cardboard.   ah.   ah.  hmm...  but if jumpy's house was going to stay really warm, it needed a door.  only squirrels can't turn doorknobs.  george could think about it while he ate lunch.  hmm...  maybe... a teapot could be a door.    nah.  or... maybe a ceramic chicken thingie.   nah.  or...  uhuh.  mmm.  that's it.  a postcard would be just the right size.    ah.  now that his house was finished, he had to furnish it.    it was the perfect squirrel house.  hey.   getting jumpy to live there was harder than george thought.     ah...  his squirrel house was missing one very important thing...  hahaha.       jumpy was surprised.  the monkey's place was nice.  it was warm and dry.  now everyone would be cozy this winter.  it was a good thing that george knew how to make cozy, insulated houses.  huh.  a very good thing.  oh, no.   girl: george is a monkey girl: george is a monkey.  he made a home for jumpy to protect him from the cold weather.  hi. i'm norman from the mass audubon's blue hills trailside museum.  kids: hi, norman.  girl: we're talking about animals and how they survive in the wild.  girl: the snowy owl usually lives in the arctic.  norman: they live outside all year long, and so they don't need a house to survive.  their home is their feathers.  their feathers keep them warm.  an owl.  an owl.  girl: a barn owl.  a barn owl.  that's right, it's a barn owl.  some birds, like the barn owl, live in a cavity of a tree.  girl: we're making a birdhouse that works like a hole in a tree.  it's for small birds, like a wren or a bluebird.  girl: we should try to preserve the animals' homes, because you don't know if the animal that lives in there might be endangered. )
