"it's a superspy's job to discover secrets, and doubleoh doggy is the best." uhhuh.  "he has lots of tools to help him.  hey.  that's a periscope, remember.  huh.  uh... uhuh.  well, inside the tube are two mirrors.  the mirror at this end reflects whatever it's pointing at to a mirror at this end.  oh...  that way,doubleoh doggy can see things...  : without being seen himself.   all right, good night, little spy monkey.   the next day, george started practicing to be a superspy like doubleoh doggy.  george, if you have any paper to recycle, put it in this bin, okay.  um, george.   a superspy needed a spy name.  george became...  ah...  ...doubleoh monkey.  professor wiseman.  i was wondering...  can we meet an hour later.  a superspy had to be smart, quiet...   ...and quick with his hands...  and feet.  : there's this thing i want to get for george.  he is going to love it.   ooh.  sometimes superspies had to go undercover.  oh, grea then.  whew.  he'd only been a superspy for two minutes, and doubleoh monkey already had his first spy mission: find out what the man with the yellow hat was going to get him.  but he had to make sure he wouldn't be seen.    george.  staying out of sight...   ...was complicated.  hi, how ya doin'.  wha... .  george.  hmm. no.  huh.  even puddles could give you away.  do you have this in stock.    a barking charkie was even worse than a puddle.  shh. shhshhshh.  the last thing a spy wants is to attract attention.  shh.  that sounds like charkie.  she must've escaped again.   shh.  obviously, not every dog was a good spy like doubleoh doggy.   i got it.    well, we found charkie.  sorry. we'll help clean that up.  no, it's all right.  just take charkie home.  thanks.  okay, bye.   hmm, let's see now.  it should be here somewhere.    george.  huh. that's funny.  your baby looks just like my monkey.   i mean, uh, he's a goodlooking monkey.  i mean...  oh, boy.  hmm...  doubleoh monkey's efforts were about to pay off.  sorry, we're all sold out of those.  huh.  those.  those what.  oh.  oh. well, i'll have to try mabel's.  you want some help cleaning that up.  it's gonna take some time.  man: oh, that's okay.  i don't mind.   it was hard being a superspy without the right tools.  hmm...  what he needed was a periscope.   unfortunately, he didn't have one.  but maybe he could make one while the man with the yellow hat was busy stacking animals.   to make a periscope, he needed something long and hollow.  ah... uhhuh.   and a couple of mirrors.   and some scissors.  uh...  figuring out where all the holes should go wasn't easy.   mmhmm.  whoohoo.   oh...  it took a while to get the angle of the periscope just right.    he was gonna need something to hold it all together.   at last, doubleoh monkey had his spy periscope.   and not a moment too soon.   george's periscope worked great.  he could see between things...  ...over things...  ...and around things.  nothing was too hairy for hisperiscope.   except maybe charkie.         how could he keep his eye on the man with the yellow hat now.     a broken periscope can't stop a superspy with tools like a mirror and the brain of a monkey.  oh.   huh.   you wouldn't be a...  spy monkey, would ya.   did you make this.  : uhhuh.  : wow. this is very good.   really. but, you know, it's not nice to spy on people.   and it can ruin surprises like... this.   now, do you want an official doubleoh doggy periscope, or would you rather just...  make another one.   you want both.  uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.  when you're a superspy monkey...  you need lots of ways to keep your eyes on things.  girl: george is a monkey, so he can do things that we can't do. i is a monkey, so he can do things that we can't do.  girl: george was spying, and the man saw him in reflections.  : today, we are playing with mirrors.  three pieces.  boy: i'm trying to straighten the wrapping paper out, so i can see myself.  it reflects better when it is smooth.  we found things around the house that were like mirrors.   boy: our heads look strange because it's round, and round things that are like this do that.  it, like, stretches you out.  girl: erica found a weird reflection on a faucet.  boy: i am setting up a way to see erica around a corner.  thomas was able to look around the corner using a reflection at my mirror.  i got it.  wow.  mission complete.  thomas: this was kind of like george's periscope.  we made a periscope.  we took two mirrors and attached it with some tape onto a tube.  you put your forehead right here.  this mirror reflects to that mirror.  then, you see up, and you can see over things.  i can see you.  i see an alienhe's right there.    it was a perfect day to practice your golf swing.   ooh.  unfortunately for jumpy squirrel...   ...that's exactly what george and bill were doing.   the tee's all yours, george.  aha.   uhhuh.    oh...    want to learn a little trick, george.  uhhuh, uhhuh.  if you don't choke up on the club, you can really whack the ball.  the more club you got between you and the ball...  the farther the ball goes when you hit it.  try it.  huh.     nice swing, george.   i don't know how it works, but it's something called leverage.  it makes you stronger than you really are.  huh.  keep practicing.  practice is important if you want to be a good golfer.  there was no telling when you might get to practice your swing.  ha.  ooh.   : thanks, george.  uh, whoawhoawhoa.  huh.   so when the man with the yellow hat told george they were going to scotland to help uncle tam move, george and his club were raring to go.  only the club wasn't going anywhere.   trust me, george, you don't need to bring a golf club to scotland.    welcome to scotland.   no wonder he didn't need to bring his club.  this was like having an uncle with his very own golf store, to go with his very own golf course...  at his very own castle.   why don't you go hit a few while this fella and i pack up for the move.  oh. haha.   and keep an eye out for that thievin' squirrel.  he's always after me golf balls. )
