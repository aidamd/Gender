curious...    like curious...curious george.   oh...  captioning sponsored byuniversal animation  narrator: george loved spending time in the country where there was nothing to do but...  nothing.  hello.  mm, george, the grapes have come in.  want a taste.  ooh...  yeah, uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.  george was busy doing nothing, but he could always drop in for some grapes.   george hadn't stepped in any normal hole...  huh..  ooh.  somebody was living down there.     mrs. renkins: george.  george.   george wondered why his new friends ran away when they heard mrs. renkins.  you all right, george.  i see you found one of our many gopher holes.  so those guys were gophers.   never seen gophers.  uhuh.  yeah, they dig a tunnel and travel underground.  now those mounds are the entrances to their tunnel.  mmhmm.   ooh, gabby grapegrabbing gophers grab my greatest grapes.  relax, dear.  mr. calhoun, the gopher getter, is coming to take them away.  i will pay double if he nabs every nasty nopher...  gopher. oh.  : you have to excuse mr. renkins.  gophers got his goat.  calhoun is here.  your gopher problems are over.  oh. that is the biggest gopher i ever saw.  huh.  : oh...  this is george.  he's our nextdoor monkey.   ah, there's your gophers.   you see, the entrance mounds give away the boundaries of their tunnels.  huh.  there are no mounds outside this yard.  that means...  they have no escape.   by the time they realize they need a new tunnel, i'll have caught 'em all.  we don't want the gophers hurt.  naturally.  i catch the little sweeties and take 'em to a new, happier home far, far away.    george felt it was only fair to warn the gophers.    shh.   george invited them to come live in his yard.  huh.  of course. gophers travel by tunnel.  so he told them to tunnel over to his yard.   but gophers don't speak monkey...   ...so he decided to dig the tunnel for them.  george, look at the size of this squash i pulled out of the garden.  uhhuh. bye.  bye.  wow, i wish it was yellow.   squeaking  doh.  okay, time to break out the heavy equipment.   george felt like he'd been digging for longer than he'd done anything, ever.  he had to be at the renkins' yard by now.   hey, george, digging a tunnel to your house.  no.  lost your way, huh.  uhhuh.  oh... city kids don't have compasses, huh.  a compass helps tell which direction you're going.   well, it always points north.  you figure out which way you want to go and you can tell where you're facing because you always know which way is north.   oh, yeah.  that'd help you.  why didn't i think of that.  hey, can i have that dirt.  ma bunny dug holes all over the lawn and dad says i have to fill them up.    boy, can that bunny dig.  thanks.  anything you want to borrow, just ask.  huh.  hey.    what, you think of something you want to borrow already.  uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.  there, there.  aha.  okay, gophers stroll in, eat delicious grapes, trigger the rope, gate slams shut, and wham.  gotcha, gophers.     ooh, ooh, ooh.  hey, gophers, come on in.  here, have a delicious grape.    oh, no.  : no.  are you here to catch 'em or feed 'em.   just, uh, testing out the gopher cage.  works. it's pretty good.  oh, boy, my back.  don't worry.  i'm gonna go get the extraheavy equipment, which has never ever failed.  i'll just be back. i'm gonna go.  george had everything he needed: a compass, a professional digger...   and a way to get rid of the used dirt.  all he needed was enough time.  attention, gophers.  all aboard the calhoun crane express.     you can't hide anymore.        i did it.  i caught you, you grapestealing...  monkey..  i've got you, george.  calhoun, i have decided the gophers aren't as annoying as you.  you go. the gophers can stay.  oh, boy.    oh, what a mess.  so, uh, who wants to help me clean this up.  i can pay you in grapes.  gi boy: george is a monkey, and he can do stuff we can't do.  girl: he dug a tunnel to save the gophers.  we are making sand tunnels.  boy: today, we are at the beach trying to build a castle.  boy 2: we're making tunnels right through the castle.  girl: kailash is on one end, jason's on another end, and i'm on this end.  it's like three separate tunnels.  is this good.  but we know that we're going to meet.  oh,yeah.  we connected.  we connected.  we connected.  i can connect you guys.  oh, my goodness.  the tunnel collapsed.  it collapsed.  it means that it fell down.  maybe the sand was too weak.  we have two big holes here.  we are going to try to dig a tunnel from this hole to that hole.  i hope it doesn't collapse.  maybe the last tunnel was not thick enough.  we made the tunnel thick and strong.  we connected.  oh, oh, oh.  whoa, whoa, whoa.  i can see the water comes in.  oh, my goodness.  girl: the water made the sand drop into the tunnel again, so kailash is digging it all out.  narrator: george was happy because he had a very important job to do today.   very funny, george.  and no, it wasn't doing cat impersonations.   his job was to watch professor wiseman's new kitten lucky who was too young to take care of himself.   whew.   we have to go now.  can you believe city workers digging a new water pipe found dinosaur bones.  yeah, george, we only have a few hours to rescue the bones before they start digging again.  we're lucky to get even a few hours.   and speaking of lucky, you're too little and too silly to come along, aren't you.  aren't you.  goodbye, lucky.   thanks, george.  see you back home, george.  and please, take good care of lucky.   good. george planned on taking excellent care of lucky.   you're in charge of the lobby till i get back, hundley.     now what was that monkey bringing into his lobby.  probably something that spills or smells or oozes or...    lucky had no idea what hundley was.  he'd never seen a dog before.   but he liked the way it smelled.  he liked the way it felt...   ...and he liked the way it sounded.  in fact, lucky liked everything about hundley.    hundley wasn't so sure a dignified dachshund should allow a kitty to walk on his back.    whew.    hundley. bless you.  is this your kitten, george.  uhhuh. uhhuh.  hundley's allergic to certain cats, and that cat must be one of 'em.  oh...   please, keep it away.          lucky missed hundley already.  but how could lucky be with hundley if he wasn't allowed near him.  hmm...  hey.  george could build lucky a perfect sneezefree wiener dog.  lucky seemed to like the way hundley sounded.  what did hundley sound like.   huh.  hello.  byebye.  george had to find something that made a bumpbump sound.   now, what else did lucky like about hundley.  lucky liked the way hundley felt.  oh...  uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.  and now just a few more things and george could build a hundley.  aha.     tada.    lucky had never seen one of these before.    he liked the way it felt.   he liked the way it sounded.    but he did not like the way it smelled.     nope, that didn't smell like hundley.  but what did hundley smell like.  oh.   oh, yeah, he smelled like...  that hundley smell.  oh.  now where could george get something that smelled like hundley.  huh.   this pillow smelled like hundley.  and then some.    hundley sure didn't like to share his pillow.    that was the sound of lucky's friend.  hundley was here.   no doubt about it.  hundley was inside this thing.               the barks stopped.  but lucky was sure hundley was in here somewhere.   oh.  hey.  uhoh.            shh.  lucky was somewhere in the walls.    huh. huh.  man: hi, george, we're on our way home with pizza and dinosaur bones.  i hope you and lucky are having fun.  uhoh.  how could he find lucky behind the wall if he couldn't see or hear him.    aah.   huh.  aha.      at that moment, hundley realized every undignified moment of his life involved george.       hundley had enough.  now his nose was starting to itch.   lucky recognized that sound.          george had to hope he was right.  the more hundley sneezed, the closer he was to lucky.           george knew exactly where lucky was.  except... he was still inside the wall.   i heard hundley sneezing through the grate downstairs.  please, keep that cat away.  where is the cat.    oh, boy.  nobody move.       all right, little guy, you're free.      oh, george, wait till you hear about the weird digging we did...  eh... today.    wha... what, what, what.  i'm learning that sometimes it's better not to even ask.    boy: george is a monk girl: orge is a monkey, so he can do things that you can't do.  girl 2: he designed and built his own hundley.  we are also designing and building.  we're not making wiener dogs like george.  we're first graders.  we're designing bugs.  but then the third graders, they're building the bugs.  can you tell me some of the things about the spider.  there are eight eyes and there's like this red thing right there.  girl: and it stands for it's poisonous.  do you want it to be scary or funny.  scary.  girl: you have to just tell them every single thing so they can just do it.  we'll make you a bug.  it's going to be a black widow.  on the picture there's some baby spiders, so we're going to make some baby spiders so that they are more satisfied with what we make.  i'm working on the eyes, and i just made it exactly like they colored it in.  i took the clear straw and i put the pipe cleaner through.  it looked like just what the first graders wanted.  ohh.  girl: it's a baby ant.  girl 2: i think it's great.   we tried to make it just perfect for you guys.  it's good.  ohh.   i like the spiky parts.    for more fun withcurious george and his friends, visit your local library and read morecurious georgeadventures.  or visit the
