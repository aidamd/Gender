his lucky night.  sorry to pick you up so late, but a satellite's just crashed from space.  it needs to be found right away.  there's the einsteinpizza research ship just ahead.   our mission is timesensitive, so please, no dawdling.  huh.  : that means we have to hurry.  oh. uhhuhhuhhuh.  we must locate and retrieve this miniature weather satellite.  it splashed down close by, eabouts are unknown.  you three will search the ocean floor in the sub.  we're gonna ride in a sub.  george, we're going in a sub.    any questions.  you in the yellow hat.  did you request our help based on our stellar work in outer space.  actually, it's because i find small submarines much too, um... confining.  and i don't like it when fish look at me.  huh.  let's get moving.  atmospheric forces are impinging on the satellite's external structure.  compromising its delicate circuitry even as we speak.  that means water might be leaking into the satellite, and the data module will be damaged if we don't hurry.  ah, got it.  we're ready.  uhhuh.   okay, george, keep your eyes peeled for that satellite.  : okay.   whoa.  did we find the satellite already.  no. i don't know what that is.   ah, that's what it iswe woke up a giant sea turtle.  hey...     now, that's the satellite's locating device.  we're close.  they're close.  close.  i said that.  i know.  wiseman : hold on. we may have a problem.  we're blocked by a coral reef.  tony: is there any way around it.  wiseman: only a tiny passage.  the sub is much too big to fit through.   return to the ship.  we'll have to try another approach.  the satellite is within that reef.  man: and there's no way get to it.  scientist: i don't know.  we're experts on space, not the sea.  quint: you, in that ship, do not proceed.  huh.   george, is that you.  mr. quint.  what are you doing in these waters.  well, studying the local sea life.  hey, you're an expert on fish and stuff.  is there any way to get in there to retrieve a satellite.  not in this tub.   a coral reef is a very fragile environment.  ship this size will damage it.  the only way in is a tunnel about, oh, yea big.   yeah, uhhuh.  mr. quint, don't move your hands.  george can do it.  george can do it.   yeah, well, this supplies your air.  now just breathe naturally, george.   your helmet contains a camera, microphone and headphones.  this locator will flash when you're close to the satellite.  be a good little sea monkey.  narrator: the swim fins helped george swim fast.  this was going to be easy.   quint: careful. don't get distracted.  welcome to the coral reef, george.  those look like plants and rocks, but they're fragile animals called coral polyps.  they live in colonies.  whoo.  the skeletons of hard coral are made of limestone.   those hard skeletons create the foundation of the reef.  wow.  the reef's home to all kinds of sea life, ah.  sort of like how a big city is home to all kinds of people.   what happened.  george, can you hear us.    hi.   narrator: the coral reef was so much fun, george almost forgot why he was there.   huh. oh.  wiseman : george, you're near the satellite.  head to the sea floor.  ah. byebye.  byebye.  wiseman: can you see it.  uh...  uhuh.   wiseman: what.  did you find it.   nice, but we're not looking for crabs, george.   ooh. hey.   huh.   are those shhsharks.  those are small reef sharks.  ohoh, oh... oh.  quint : they're not interested in monkeys.  the coral reef supplies them with food.  huh..  ah. hoohoh.    ah.  ahhaha.  he found it.  he found it.  that's my monkey.  george, can you see an open place to move the satellite to.  uhhuh.  wiseman : good.  now release your emergency marker.  uhuh.  wiseman: i'll fly over and drop you a line.   all right.   aah... ah.  man : all right, george.  now attach the hook to the satellite.  uhoh.     i was gonna bring you up one at a time, but this worked, too.   mm...  the data module is intact.  our research is saved.  thanks to george.  all: george.  narrator: yup, flying in a helicopter was fun, but george liked exploring the ocean better,.  because in the sky, there are no sea turtles.  girl: george is a monkey, so sometimes he does things that you can't do.  boy: george was watching the creatures in the coral reef and almost forgot about the satellite.  girl: this is the ecodiscovery center.  boy: philippe cousteau and alexandra cousteau are talking about coral reefs, and they're from earth echo.  earth echo teaches peoplehow to make a difference.  should we protect the coral reefs.  yes. yes.  girl: because they're a living creature.  alexandra: they're like communities, like a neighborhood.  all of the fish that we have in the oceans are connected in some way to the corals.  philippe: it's important to make sure that they're healthy because if you pollute too much, the whole coral reef gets hurt and the whole neighborhood can fall apart.  man: do you see the little tiny tentacles sticking outside of each one.  use that to grab food.  boy: if people destroy coral reefs, all the fish in the coral reefs will die.  so why destroy it when you can just see all its beauty.   narrator: renkins' farm was a playground for a monkey.   there were cows, hens...   and little mike, george's favorite pig.   ah... ah.   ah... ah.   ah.   man: wow.  you may have a real future in pig training, george.  uhhuh, uhhuh.  oh, hi.  and you taught him to shake.    aah.  well, that one needs a little work.    come and hear the news.  oscar made the state finals in the pretty face competition for pigs.   congratulations, oscar.  whoohoo.   now they're off to the county fair to win first prize...  without me.  oh, sorry, dear, but someone has to do the work first thing in the morning.  mrs. renkins: we'll get back just a little too late.  i would volunteer, but i have no experience.  oh, it's not hard.  you and george could handle it.  one day.  cinchy.  yeah, uhhuh.  you'll just have to feed the pigs, collect eggs from the hens and milk the cows.  oh, gee, ii, i don't, ..  george: uhhuh, yeah.  uhuhuhuhuhhuh.  you sure, george.  i mean, a farmer has to get up with the sun and work hard.  uhhuh, uhhuh.  oh, it'd mean a lot to oscar to have his old dad there rootin' him on.  well... um... okay.   oh, you'll have a blast.  mr. renkins: now, remember, milk leslie from the side, not from behind, or she might get nervous and kick.  ya milk her like this.    now, george, this pail holds one gallon.  when it's full...  use it to fill four onequart bottles.  man: one gallon, that's the same as four quarts.  you got that, george.  uhhuh, uhhuh.    hey.  now, there are eight hens and six chicks.  eight and six...  always count the chicks.  the little rascals tend to wander off.  ah.   what..   we just have the one rooster.  you'll know where he is.  huh.    collect the eggs from the henhouse, then put them in cartons.  each carton holds a dozen.   oh, a dozen is twelve, george.  ten plus two.  ah.    man: monkey asleep...  alarm set for 5:00 a.m.  alarm is on.   i just hope i could wake george up that early.  narrator: george was too excited to sleep.  he wondered if it was time to start.  15 more minutes.   narrator: he decided to let the man sleep until the alarm woke him up.  george could handle a little farm work alone.  cinchy.    narrator: the renkins didn't say whether he should wake leslie up before milking her.  they said remember to milk her from the side.  except george forgot.   whoa.          narrator: george had to round up those chickens.  did he get them all.  one, two, three, four, five, six, seveneight hens that's right.   one, two, three, four, fivefive chicks and one jumpy squirrel.  huh. huh..  that wasn't right.    george had seen mrs. renkins drive the tractor, but how did she turn it off.      narrator: whew.  this side had doors, too.  but george still had to stop the tractor.  maybe working a farm was more than one monkey could handle alone.   oh, george, cut it out.  oh, hi, mike.  mike..   how did you get in here.  the... the...  the alarm's turned off.  there's... there's a pig in my bed.  george.    george, what are you....  how did....    okay, okay, just, just sit tight, okay.    are you okay, george.   yeah.      well, let's round 'em up, pardner.    i don't know if you did that on purpose, george, but it worked.  whoowhoa.  phew.  well, don't relax yet, george.  we promised the renkins we'd have the chores done before they got back.  whoo.   huh.    that's a dozen eggs.  ten plus two.   one, two, threefour quarts, george.  nice job.  uhhuh.   all done.   just in time, too.  welcome home.  so, how'd he do.  oscar won.  he's the prettiest pig you've ever seen.  it's official.    tough morning, huh.  well, um, actually... yeah.  you know, because you're such a good farmer, huh.  yep. that and the fact that mike's on your roof.  what..  huh..  narrator: that's how george learned to always count everything twice, and check your roof for pigs.   girl: geor girl: george is a monkey, so sometimes he does things that we can't do.  boy: george tried to measure milk from a cow.  we are measuring water.  boy: we're helping my dad clean the fish tank.  this stuff is water conditioner.  it helps keep the water clean.  we need to put two drops in ever gallon of water.  boy: so we need to measure the water.  jake and conrad are going to see how many quarts make a gallon.  one quart.  two quarts.  three quarts.  four quarts.  we have one gallon.  i have to put two drops of water conditioner.  one, two.  we filled up gallons, added drops and put the gallons into the tank until it was full.  jake: now we have four gallons in one fish tank.  look at the salamander.  yeah.  curious george loves discovering new things.  so i'm taking all these pennies i've been saving up and putting them into this old milk carton.   now we have something new.  do you know what it is.  kids: a bank.  we discovered a way to reuse something old in a new way, and curious george lovesdiscovering new things for you and him to doat pbskids.org.  coming up next,
