never be bored    if you ask yourself, what is this.    like curious like curious    curious george   oh.  in the country, things tendto move at a slower pace.    except for the manwith the yellow... helmet.   ah. whoohoohoo.  he was training fora triathlon race on saturday, and george was helping.   how'd i do, george.   what.  the guys are still fixing the roof. uhhuh.  roof repair wasa country thing...  that happened slowly.   the hole is bigger than we thought.  a lot of water got in.  ooh.  wow. that's a hole, all right.   we have to patch the hole, then fix the ceilings in the bedrooms.   ah. oh. hmm.   is that my bed.  yeah. the upstairs will be downstairs...  while we fix the hole and the ceilings.  oh. i wonder how george will be with sleeping in the living room.  that's a pretty big change.   when it comes to change,monkeys bounce back quickly.   but there are drawbacksto having your bedroom...  in your living room, especially after dark.   oh.  in the dark,everything lookedand sounded different.  it made it hardfor a monkey to sleep.        what's that. ooh.  well, what do you know. bats.  ah.  they must have come in through the hole in the roof.  uh, this way, guyoh. ow.  oh. i wish i were a bat.  then i could see in the dark too.  huh.  huh.  they can't exactlysee when it's this dark.  they use their ears instead of eyes. oh.  okay, out you go.  ah.  that was exciting. you want a glass of milk to help us sleep.  uhhuh.     well, uh, bats screech...  to find out where they are.  they can't see in the dark, so they have to use a different sense.  huh.  you remember senses, george.  we have five of themsight, sound, taste, touch and smell.   right.  bats use their sense of sound to hear where they're going.  ah.  see, their voices bounce off things, so they know where stuff is even if they can't see it.  oh.  you think you can sleep now, george.  ah. uhhuh.   the glass of milkworked like a charm...  for monkeys.   the next day,the man looked really tiredat his triathlon training.   time me, george.  ooh. ah.  once i find the lake.    george hoped the manslept tonight.  and he did.  but george didn't.  aw.  now, what would help himfall asleep.  ah.milk.  that's what george needed.  hmm. he didn't wantto wake the man.  he'd have to find his wayto the kitchen in the dark.  oh. ow, ow.    hmm.  it's hard to knowwhere furniture isif you can't see it.  and then george remembered.   see, their voices bounce off things, so they know where stuff is even if they can't see it.  if bats could do it,so could he.     george couldn't hear his voicebounce off anything.  maybe he needed to be louder.      whawhat are you doing.   sorry.       huh. what.  mornin'.   george felt awful.  he'd kept the man up again.  okay, george. i'm going on my run.   oh.  maybe after a cup of tea.   if only he had some way...  to quietly find the kitchenin the dark.  he couldn't seeor hear his way.  mmm.  hey.  maybe georgecould taste his way.    george, don't eat off the floor. use a sponge.  uh, okay.  okay. so he couldn'tuse taste.  what other senses were there.  want some honey in your oatmeal.  ah.  maybe touch.   if george felt honeyeywith his feet, he'd know he was goingthe wrong way.   he was so excitedabout his path, he could hardly wait untilhe couldn't fall asleepto try it out.     the honey was working.  he was finding his wayby touch.   ooh.  trouble is,once you step in honey, it sticks to your feet.  uhoh. ooh.  and before you know it,it feels like it's everywhere.   oh.  george, what are you doh.  ooh.  eee.   huh.  george needed to feel his waywith something less messy.  ah.  maybe something... soft.   i'm going for a ride, george.  ah.   george's soft pathhad to work.    whawhat.  because the man's racewas tomorrow, and he neededto get some sleep.  oh. ah. ooh. oh.  i'm okay.   george's stuffed animalswould tell him wherethe furniture was, but he needed more soft thingsto lead him to the kitchen.  ooh.   uhhuh.  george sure hopedhis path worked.   sorry it's so late.  i kept fallin' asleep.  ibig race tomorrow.  gotta go to bed early.  right after su ah.george didn't even have towait until bedtime...  to try his soft path out.   he did it. he'd made it to the kitchen, and he didn't wake the man.  aha.  in fact, he used his pathmany, many, many times.  because he was so excitedabout the man's race tomorrow, he was the onewho couldn't sleep.   the next morning,george was there...  to cheer on the manas he swam.   go, go, go.   and rodepeter, go.   and ran his wayto the finish line.   oh, did you see that, geoeh, george.  but george missed the finish.   all that walking aroundmade a monkey very sleepy.   george learned tofeel his way to the kitchen.  we are usingour sense of touch...  to make snacksin the kitchen.  can you make your sandwich...  using just your sense of touch.  she was going straightdown the table, and then she found the bread.  i put my hand on the bread, and then i put the mayonnaiseover my hand.  then i moved my hand away...  so it would get on the bread.  i am going to have yogurtwith granola and blueberries.  my hands were takingthe place of my eyes.   i was using my sense of hearing.   when i heard laughing, i knew something funny happened.  even though we couldn't see, we did a very good jobusing only our sense of touch.  opening day of the museum'saviation show.  and if there's one thingmonkeys, dogs and menwith yellow hats...  are amazed by, it's flying machines.   ah.   george. oh, boy.   ah.  ooh.  yeah, that's a propeller.  propellers move a plane by pulling air in...  through the front of the propellers...  and blowing air out the back.  ah.  hey. ooh. ah.   no. george, that's not how you use it.     uh meanwhile, hundleywas enjoyinga hundleysized air show.  my greatgrandfather flew a balloon...  from florence to paris.  aviators from every country went to paris to race flying machines, like all of these.  oh.  ah. it would have been great to see that.   see it.  hundley wishedhe could have flown in it.  flying looked almost as excitingas being a lobby dog.   nice souvenir.  have fun.  uh. it sure is hot in here.  the air conditioner stopped.  now that hundley's back, i can leave my post to fix it.   mind helping out.  no problem.  george, you wanna stay here and help hundley watch the lobby.  uhhuh.   that fan made a strong wind.  ah.  george wanted to seehow fast the plane would fly...  using rubberband powerplus the wind from the fan.    but all hundley wantedwas to do his job...  and enjoy his balloon.  huh.his balloon.  huh.he'd let go of the string.   uhoh.   oh.  oh. oh.   hmm.  george had an ideaonly a monkey could think of.  aha.  and he knew just wherethe man kept his fishing pole.   meanwhile, the hot roomturned hundley's worriesinto a dream.  famous british aviatorlieutenant doxie...  flew to parisfor the 1909 internationalair show and race.   sir, yes, sir.  descending, sir.   daring bipedal aviatormademoiselle wiseman...  was also competing.   oh, good to see you again, doxie.  loser buys winner dinner, like last spring in vienna.   ooh. isn't that that daring american flyboy, chuck monkey.   chuck monkey was the first pilotto fly over the north pole.  accidentally,but he did it.   doxie worried chuckcould win this race.  he'd heard it was hardto beat a monkey...  with a rubber band.  oh.   and there was the dynamicleaning tower team.  ciao, chuck the monkey.   and who was this new competitor.   huh.    i am baron concooler, the flying dutchman.  you are doxie, no.   obviously, pilotsthe world over...  had heard ofthe great lieutenant doxie.  chuck monkey.  oh. can i your autograph have.  huh.  ah.  many thanks.  i am your biggest fan.  ah.  more than ever, doxie wantedto beat that monkey...  and become the world'smost famous aviator.  the contestants lined up.  and the signal was givento start the race.  the leaning tower teamwas the first to take off.    what did we say about claws in the balloon.  they landed in florence, italynine minutes later.  race.  and then he wasn't.  sir, the drive belt snapped.  we can't go if the prop don't spin.   yes, sir.  of course. we can use the belt from an automobile.  i'll get one.   woof.   it looked likedoxie couldn't hope to beatthat american monkey.   there was no chanceof winning now.  but thenthe monkey tightenedhis rubber band...  one turn too many.  this race wasn't over yet.  no power.  without propellers, my ship will go wherever the wind blows it.  oh, my.  help.  ohoh.  chuck monkey had to help.  but his plane couldn't fly.  fortunately, doxie's shipwas still on the ground.  he explained the emergencyas they took off.    but lieutenant doxiedidn't understand.   the monkey ruined his ship,and now he was about to dothe same to the doxie's.  i got a belt, sir. come back.  but they couldn't go back...  because they couldn'tcontrol the ship.  ooh.   if they didn'tget a belt quickly, they, too, would blowinto the eiffel tower.   yeah.   clothes for a belt.what a great idea.     ah.  oh.   how can i ever thank you.  putting the baron inan emergency life balloon, the clever flyers usedtheir ship's propellers...  to create a windto blow him backto the landing field.  they saved the baronwhining ] but they were in last place.  oh.    still, no obstaclewas too big...  for chuck monkeyand lieutenant doxie.    maybe together,they could win this race.   it wasn't 1909.  hundley wasn't in a race.  and his balloonwas still stuck.   but if it was a dream, why could he still hearhis air ship's propeller.  the fan.  it sounded a lotlike a propeller.  and it lookeda lot like a propeller.  and if it moved air, it would move thingsthat wereinthe air, right.  oh.  george raced backwithout the fishing pole...  because he had another idea.    and it was the same ideathat hundley just had.  george aimed the fan.   hundley barked orderslike a famous aviator.  aiming the windbehind the balloon, george could push itwhere he wanted it to go.     aha.   air conditioning is all fixed.  hundley, you're relieved from duty.  you wanna go to the park and fly that plane, george.    mmmmm.  hundley had something elsehe needed to do.   won't be needing this anymore.   you want it on.  okay. kind of noisy, if you want a nap.  mmm.  it was exactly what hundleywanted to hear...  because he hadsome unfinished businessback in 1909.   with the aid of a monkey, the doxie is pulling ahead.  folks, if they win this one, people will be talkingabout this victorya hundred years from now.  george used a fanto move things throuings through the air.  we are going to move thingswith a fan too.  hey. hey, what are you doing.   you should only playwith a fan...  when there's a grownup to help you.  we could make pinwheels.  the blades are curved.  this is what catches the wind.  then the pinwheelis using the windto make it spin.  now we are makingpaper airplanes.  now i'm gonna try droppingthe plane in front of the fan.  i don't think the fan is helping that much.  i think the balloon worksbetter with the fan...  than the paper airplane.  this is the surface of the balloon.  the plane has much less surface.  i think that that's whythe balloon goes further.  babom.  it's fun when you make things fly.  with a bigger than big movie event.  bite: is the sky falling.
