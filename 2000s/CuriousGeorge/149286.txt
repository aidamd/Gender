"current" is moving water.  the oceans are huge, and they're always moving.  oh.  so, anyhow, i never got my birthday present.  aw.  yes, but with your help, this story may have a happy ending.  how.  on my birthday boat trip today, our equipment picked up a surprising sound...  from far below.   we believe the gift has ridden the current, recording ocean data for six whole years, and now it's here.  whoa.  the data could reveal a lot about our oceans.  but we must find it fast.  the battery only lasts six years.  huh.   when the power runs out, which could be at any moment, it will go silent and be lost forever.  george understoodthey had no time to spare.  they needed to act fast,and he was ready to help.   let's get in the sub and find it.  we get to ride in the sub, right.  no. that's why we called you.  you called us not to ride in the sub.   the sub's in the shop for a tuneup and periscope lube.  we have to use this mini submersible.  it has a microphone and camera, so we can hear and see under sea.  oh.  i just added those grabbers to grab the gift, but the controls take up too much room inside.  oh. well, i think george...  is the only one who could fit in that small space.  exactly.  want to rescue a lost birthday present in a mini sub, george.   it didn't take longfor george...  to learn to use the grabbers.    remember, be a good little monkey...  in a submarine.  aye, aye. aye, aye.  that bleep is now being picked up...  by the mini's external microphone.  and the louder it gets, the closer you are to the bleeping gift.  i'll pilot the mini from here.   here i go wave goodbye and say hello     to a world i've never seen    catch my jaw dropping from what i just saw    am i awake or in a dream.   hey, hey.   there's nothing here to stop me    and i want to see it all    i'm going down, down, down    where the fish go to school and the plants are so cool    i'm going down, down, down    where the turtles can fly and i'm wishing that you    could be    underneath the waves with me    george, do you see it.  uhuhuh.  there's only one explanation.  that's not our bleep.  you mean, this has just been a wild bleep chase.  mmhmm.  george.  we're scrapping the mission.prepare to come home.  oh.  when george retractedthe grabbers, he saw the crabs run away.  and thenhe saw something else.    something's wrong. pizza, bring him back fast.  wait. what is it, george. did you find it.  uhhuh. uhhuh.  did you get it, george. uhhuh.  well, i'll be doggone. yes. all right, george.  good job.    that was a pod of whales. you okay.  uhhuh.    he lost it. steer him after it.  i can't. i lost the camera. i lost power.  i have no control.  you meanwe have to let the monkey drive the submarine.   george, you have to pilot the ship.   use the control stick on the dash.   george figured outhow to steer quickly...  and bumpily.   ah.  now that he had control, george took command.  because a monkey always getshis... bleeping thing.  sounds like he's getting warmer. he's chasing it.  of course. george doesn't know the meaning of "give up." or... "dental floss."    huh.  the light went out,the bleeping stopped.  hey.  oh.  george, i'm afraid that means the battery died.  you'll never find it in the darkness.  oh.  george was disappointedhe couldn't find the gift.  he went so deep.  there was nothingdown there at all.  nothing.  there was lots down hereliving in the dark.  and the fish were completelydifferent from the ones he sawcloser to the surface.  wow.   i'm going down, down, down    where the fish go to school and the plants are so cool    i'm going down, down, down    where the turtles can fly and i'm wishing that you    could be    underneath the waves with me  ah.  there were otherlitup fish too.  they were swimmingaround something.  the recorder.   ah.  george didn't know if they werejust curious about that thing...  or helping him.  but he couldn't have found itwithout the help...  of his glowing fish friends.   bye.   there he is. and he's got it.   all right.  yay.   i put a new battery in.  all the information was saved.   we asked the right monkey for help.  oh.  thought you might like a copy of the last thing it recorded.     oh.  it's always nice to havepictures of your friends.  and how many friendscan light themselves...  for a perfect pictureevery time.  curious george learnedabout currents in an ocean, and we're making currentsin a pool.  i think when weturn on the hose, the leaves are gonna start circling around.   whoa.  all of the leaves are floating, then they're moving as the current is moving.  now whenever things get in front of the hose, they move really fast.  so fast.  maybe we can make our own current.  wow.  we used our hands so everything would circle around the pool.  we're all paddling in the same direction.  if you push hard, the faster the current goes.  wow.   we were trying to make a current with our mouths instead of our hands.  look, it's working.  it was fun to learn about currents.  a good super spyis always in demand, and doubleo monkeywas no exception.  hi.  betsy had askeddoubleo monkey...  to keep an eye on steve.  he disappears every day and won't tell me where he's going.  and steve never keeps secrets, so this one must bebig.  uhhuh.   i tried following him myself, but he always catches me.  guess i'm not as good a super spy as you.  oh.   betsy was worriedthat steve was making heranother goodluck gift...  for her dance recital.      at the last recital, steve baked betsy a cake.   whoa.   oh.   the time before that, he brought flowers.     steve's goodluck giftshad a way of going bad.  betsy wanted doubleo monkeyto follow steve...  and blow the lid offhis potentially messy plot...  because whatever stevewas cooking up, she wanted to be prepared.  huh.  betsy said when shefollowed steve, he'd gone through the park.  doubleo monkeywas on his tail.   oh.  ah.  george, what are you doing here.  huh. oh.   uh, well, cool.  gotta run.  oh.  george wanted to keep stevein his sights, but if georgecould see steve, steve might see george...again.  aha.and then he remembered.  when doubleo doggyneeded to follow someonewithout being seen, he used a tracking device...  that made a soundonly he could hear.  huh.  george didn't have anythingonly monkeys could hear.  aha.   ah.   but he did havea tracking device...  that didn't look likea tracking device.  a key ring for my favorite soccer team, the metropolis ringers.  uhhuh.  this is so cool. thanks, george.    listen to that team spirit.  uhhuh.  ah.    now doubleo monkey had two waysto stay on trailsightd'oh.   ahhaha.  and sound.    huh.   aw.  but cities are noisy places.    doubleo monkey couldn't hearor see steve anywhere.  hmm.   luckily, super spies usedmore than two senses.  ah.he used his nose.  but there were a lotof sniffs to sniff.   huh.  aha.  he'd need a smell to outsmellall the other smells.   ew.  he'll be done brushinghis teeth any second.  phew.  that'sreallystrong.   uhhuh.  i hope this works. the recital is in two days.  gotta go... to that place i go...  to do that thing i do that has nothing to do with dance recitals.   did aunt margaret wash my backpack.  uhguess so.   hmm.  she must have switched detergents. this is super smelly.   doubleo monkeycould smell steve from here.   hmm.  ah.  uhhuh.  his tracking deviceswere working like a charm.  oh, no.  steve's scent was drownedin a sea of similar smells.  ah.  trail.    uhoh.  it was clear.  three senses weren't enoughto track the slippery steve.  doubleo monkeywould need four.  ah.   luckily, he knew someonewith a taste for tracking.   or, at least,a taste for treats.  i hope charkie is able to follow the crumbs.  otherwise, i'll be covered in...  whatever steve's making me this time.  time was running outfor doubleo monkey.  the recital was tonight.  this had to work.  yeah. uhhuh.     steve's trail ended here.  which room was steve in.  hmm.  oh.  his tracking device.    the sound was louder here.  he could smellthe backpack too.  ah.   betsy's gonna love this.  aha.  betsy was right.steve was makinganother surprise for her.  now i just have to find a box.  and george had tofind out what.   doubleo monkey couldn'tsee through the window.  maybe he could feelwhat it was.   it felt like a jar, and it was wet.  huh.  paint.  that was a weirdgoodluck gift.  although, betsydid love to paint.  maybe steve hada whole set of paints for her.     it was a gift that couldgo really,reallybad.  oh.  george had to warn her.      oh.  psst.   doubleo monkeywas too late.   d'oh. ohoh.   oh. oh. whoa.   ah.   luckily, super spies arevery fast on their feet.  way to go, george.   here we go again.  this is for you.   it's beautiful. thank you.  but why'd you make me a vase.  because it wasn't anything that could slop on you.  look. it's supposed to be you doing your solo.  the paint got smudged somehow when i set it out to dry.  eeh.  but i kind of like it. it makes it look like you're actually moving.   it sure was lucky you were here, george.  that vase would have smashed into a zillion pieces.   doubleo monkey saves the day again.  aw.  george used his sense of smellto track steve.  we are testingour sense of smell.  i'm trying to get them to use their nose.  natasha is getting blindfolded.  each person will be trying to guess what it is.  this is mint, these are the pickles, and this is barbecue sauce.  i'm trying to fool them.  okay. that's totally, um, mint.  that's right. you did it, tash. yay.  she guessed one of the things.  i smell mushrooms. )
