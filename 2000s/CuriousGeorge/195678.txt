looking forward to helping feed bill's bunnies, the man with the yellow hat can't drive from the city to the country fast enough.   ah.  hi, george.  afraid we won't get to play this weekend.  i'm going to my grandmother's.   the bunnies are coming, too.  grandma sure likes bunnies.  she says, "bill, i sure like bunnies."   see ya.  sadly, there'd be no bunny feeding this trip.    but there were still birds that needed to eat.  george's head was so full of bunnies, he almost forgot how much he liked to feed the birds.     you sure you want such a giant bag of bird feed, george.  uhhuh.  this big bag would feed more birds than a small box could.  and george planned to watch lots of birds eat.        ah.      and now, a fun weekend of watching happy birds eat.    hmm.   george never saw birds eat so fast.  they must be starving.  oh.     these birds were lucky they had a generous monkey around.   whew.  aha.       huh.    how did jumpy squirrel get up into the bird feeder.   that's how.  huh.   george wished there was some easier way to get the feed to the feeder, like in a dump truck or a crane...  or in this nice, handy scooper.   some days, having a working brain really pays off.     if george wanted to watch birds eat...   ...he had to keep jumpy away.  huh.   that squirrel wouldn't be able to climb up this thing and get into the feeder from way over here.   the next morning...   ...george woke up to his favorite soundbirds having breakfastand they had no squirrelly interruptions.           now george realized he had to get the feeder far from the tree trunk so jumpy couldn't jump to it.   hmm.  ha, ha, ha.   no squirrel could jump from the tree trunk all the way over here.   : aha.  problem solved.    dropping straight down seemed dangerous.  then, jumpy discovered he had another choice.   man: george.  you sure you don't want to come to the renkins.  you can work the sump pump.  uhuh.   george wanted to stay here and watch happy birds eat.         jumpy was at home in trees, so george needed to move the feeder away from trees.  but where.   ah.      george: ha, ha.         oh.   there was only one way to stop this squirrel.   george stood guard making sure the birds got their food.  this worked.    he didn't move from that spot till the feeder was empty.         no squirrel could eatthismuch.  what was he doing with it all.      aha.    ah.  jumpywasn'teating the food.  but why was he bringing it here.  huh.  that's the bowl bill always filled with squirrel food.  ah.  of course.  bill wasn't around to fill it, so jumpy was doing it.  aha. ahaha.  so george brought over plenty of food, and jumpy left the bird feeder alone.   there had to be plenty of food, because jumpy wasn't the only one dining.   even with no bunnies to feed, it turned out to be a pretty nice weekend in the country.   though this food...  was definitely for the birds.  girl: george is a monkey.  girl: george is a monkey.  he was trying to figure out ways to keep the bird feeder away from jumpy.  today, we're making bird feeders.  this is my design.  here's the milk carton, and there's a stick coming out.  and there's a hole right there.  for my design, i'm going to use a plastic bottle.  my design, it's going to have doors.  a squirrel wouldn't really be able to get in here.  i think alice made the openings too big.  the tape will help me make the holes smaller so that the squirrel can't get in.  the sparrows like their milk cartons, but the chickadees like my bottle.  and now a little bird is standing on the tape to get the seeds.  i was putting the tape on to stop the squirrels from getting it.  and it actually helped the little birds.  the sparrow and the chickadee perch in two different places.  narrator: when professor wiseman called asking for his help, the man with the yellow hat wasted no time.   he brought george in case she needed a monkey.  george brought a toy in case she didn't.  oh.     george: hello.  hey, guys.  thanks for coming.  the stuyvesant museum loaned us this dinosaur.  i need help to assemble it because an important person is coming to see it at lunchtime.  ooh.    this is what dinosaur skeletons look like before they're put together, george.  ah.  cool, huh.  uhhuh.  we even have instructions drawn by the man who dug up this fossil: dr. raj desai.  oh, great.  just show me what to do.  see, we're using these temporary clips.  now, it won't be sturdy, but we'll replace them once dr. desai looks it over.  ooh.  ah.  he's coming here to check our work.  wiseman: he's never let it be loaned out before, so we have to prove to him we'll take great care of...  whoa.  george.   george, we don't need to know what sound rare fossils make when they're banged together, okay.  oh, uhhuh.  hey, why don't you fly your plane while we work.  whoa.   ii meant outside.   oh. oh.   oh, just because it came apart doesn't mean it's ruined, george.  see.  ah.  uhhuh.   outside, okay.  uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.   hmm.  oh.  hey, this is easy.       ah.  narrator: it was easy for george to find someone to play with, since cats feel they just have to stop anything that moves.    here you go.  great.  uh... oh, right there.  okay.   uh, this skull doesn't seem right.  well, it's correct according to the instructions.  okay, if that's what it says.  whew. we're done.  just in time for lunch with dr. desai.  hey, want to join me.  and meet him.  i'd be honored.  narrator: right outside, it was the best game of cat tries to catch a plane ever.   until...   oh.      oh. ah.   narrator: if they didn't find the plane, the game was over.  huh.  narrator: this wasn't here before.  it must be what they made from those bones.  oh.  aha.   narrator: gnocchi wanted that plane.     ooh.   narrator: george wanted to help gnocchi get down, but he couldn't reach her.  ooh.    narrator: that was a bad idea.  uhoh.   dr. desai, i'd like you to meet the man who helped assemble your dinosaur.   itit looks great.  your bones are in good hands with professor wiseman.  wonderful.  so, let's have a look right away, shall we.  uh, you'd rather do that before we eat lunch.  duh, oh, mmm... lunch.  oh.  i completely forgot.  my wife says i'd forget my head if it wasn't attached.   someone important was coming to see what this looked like put together, and now it was ruined.   just because it came apart doesn't mean it's ruined, george.   oh. uhhuh.  uhhuh. uhhuh.   huh.  ah, hmm.  ah.   huh.  george wanted to work, but gnocchi wanted to have fun.  nothing makes a cat happier than winning a tug of war.   do you still make discoveries that get you excited.  sadly, no.  i've seen everything.  just once, i'd like to see something that really surprised me.  aha.  all the bones were put together...   ...but maybe it mattered which bone went where.    gnocchi was happy.  it looked like george was setting up a new round of whatever this game was.  all right, let's see my skeleton.  butbut we just ordered dessert.  uh... dessert.  of course. of course.  this memory of mine.  but i'm anxious to know how you've handled my precious bones.    being a cat, gnocchi found it exhausting watching someone else do so much work.   george's skeleton didn't look as good as that other one, even though they looked almost the same before.  uhhuh.   if they looked the same, he could figure out where the bones belonged by using the other one as a guide.    aha.  george compared every bone, and sorted them by size and shape, so before he put them together, he knew exactly what went where.  since george was done sorting the bones, gnocchi figured she'd mix them up so he could play again.      so, am i forgetting anything, or is it now time to see how you've taken care of my baby.  it's time.  oh, i'm nervous.  you have nothing to be nervous about whatsoever.  phew.  george had one side of the skeleton finished when he noticed...   ...both sides looked the same, except opposite.  he could finish by matching the remaining bones to what he'd already done.  gnocchi wished this bone game would end so they could play something cats were good at.   i'll admit i'm worried.  no one else but i has ever handled those bones before today.  only our best people have been involved.   wiseman: oh.  man: oh, boy.   your best people are a monkey and a cat..  george.   : oh, well, this isn't the skull we put on it.  it seems george was switching them.  i don't know why.  i do.  the monkey's right.  the monkey's right.   that old skull never looked right.  i think george has correctly matched the cranial structure.  huh.  now i wish i'd loaned this out years ago.  i want george to check all my future work.   and that went on record as the first scientific discovery made by a monkey...   oh.   ...assisted by a cat from an italian restaurant.   is a monkey, so he can do things you can't do.  girl: he knocked over the bones.  we are learning how bones go together.  boy: today, we're at the harvard museum of natural history.  we want to look at the pattern nature uses to build different mammals.  this is a human skeleton.  girl: there is a pattern, so in your upper arm, there's only one bone, but then, when you go down, there's two bones.  and then, there are lots of small bones in your hand.  boy: other mammals have the same pattern.  one, two, a lot.  i have to put together these sheep skeletons.  i built the left half.  you guys have to build the right half.  i put the bone there because it's the same shape and it's in the same place.  girl: we looked at the other side...  and then we put it just how it is in the other side.  kids: we are done.  announcer: someone new is coming to pbs kids.  and i'm going to be a big brother.  announcer: don't missan
