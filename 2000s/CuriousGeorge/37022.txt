   whoa    get curious  curious    and that's marvelous  marvelous    and that's your reward    you'll never be bored    if you ask yourself, what is this.    like curious like curious    curious george   oh.  the amazon rain forestis full of natural wonders.  but it can also bethe ultimate playground.  yay. aha.  everyone knows that monkeystake to junglesah.like fish take to water.  oh. ah.  ooh.    aha.   looks like george has made another friend.   fantastic.  i knew inviting you guys to the rain forest was a good idea.   should i get it. absolutely.  professor wiseman was makinga movie about the rain forest, and george andthe man with the yellow hatwere helping.  the man had brought his camera,and george hadbrought his charm.  george's newest friendis an amazonian river dolphin.  the portuguese call them boto.     oh, my goodness.   those bristles on his nose are very sensitive.  they help him find food in the muddy river bottoms.  ooh.   are you wondering why the river dolphin is pink. uhhuh, uhhuh.  well, we think it's because their veins are so close to the surface of their skin.   whee.   ooh, a lasaia agesilas butterfly.  ooh.  look.  my hope is this moviewill make everyone realize howimportant the rain forest is.  so many animals,plants and insectsthat only live here.  yeah.   these butterflies are often found eating on mineralrich sandbanks.   or... on someone's forehead.  they love the salt in our sweat.    making a movie wasthe most fun ever.   huh.  animals in the amazoncould show up quicklyand were full of surprises.   yay.  why would anyone eat dirt. yuck.    macaws eat plants that make their tummies upset.  eating clay helps them feel better.  ah.  this animalwas surprisingly slow.   well, hello, pokey.  aw, that's a sloth.  sloths survive on leaves which don't provide much energy, so they move slow.      these shots are fantastic.  thanks to george.  oh, i can't believe our luck.  move slowly. it's a tapir.  they will run away if they're startled.  whatever you do, don't startle it.  uhhuh.   they're probably gathering food for their babies.  aw. isn't that sweet, george.  they're gathering food.  foo ourfood.    oh, no.    give me the food.   ooh.  whoa.   ooh.   how did those tapirs get to our food.  i put it in an airtight bag and tied it up in a tree.  uhoh.  george meant toput the food back.  but... he forgot.   you know, george, there are worse places to run out of food than the rain forest.  see.  hey.  the man was right. the rainforest was full of bananas.   and avocados.  and coconuts.  oh.  much better than anything i pacthe camera.   oh, i'll get it. i'm good with monkeys.   nice monkey.  give me back the pretty camera.  be a good little monkey boy.  girl. that's an emperor tamarin.  with tamarins, females are always the leader.  sorrygirl.  trade you a bananaoh.    oh, no. my...  hat.  the tamarinsweren't playing fair.  wwait. we don't need the camera.  we already downloaded the film onto the computer.  hey.    hey. come back with my camera.  oh, we'll never catch them on foot.  ah.  great idea, george. we'll travel like the monkeys do.  uhhuh.   ouch. ow. oh. rope burn.   oh, i wish i had gloves.  oh.  my movie, gone.  and there's no time to shoot another. we're leaving tomorrow.  george felt terrible.  he wished there was a way tosave professor wiseman's movie.  if only he couldcatch the tamarins.   and then george remembered.  he was a monkey too.     nothing could dampengeorge's determination.  and if it did he shook it off.  we're right behind you.  whoa. whoa  but peopledidn't dry so quickly.  george was biggerthan the tamarins.  so he could cover groundor air more quickly.  ah.   but he was outnumbered.  it was the biggest treegeorge had ever seen.  could this bethe tamarin's home.  maybe nowgeorge could get that camera.       my camera. my movie.   no.  ah.  ha. good job.   i'm so glad you're a monkey.  isn't that sweet, george.  they're gathering...our food.   oh, here comes my favorite part.  trade you a bananaoh.      whoa.   ooh.    whoa.     well done.  i think they like it.   george couldn't waitto watch it again.  it was like visitingall his jungle friendsright here in the city.   george learned about animalsof the rain forest.  we are looking for animalsat the salt marsh.  today we're at mass audubon's joppa flats.  we're going to the salt marsh and looking for creatures.  and a salt marsh is a special place where lots and lots of animals live.   whoa. look at that one.  he's a little green crab.  so what you have here are some little tiny crabs...  who grow up in a salt marsh.  this is a much larger green crab.  the reason why we need to protect these salt marshes...  is it gives them a lot of food, it gives them space, it protects them from predators, and it gives them shelter.   we found four fish.  we put them in the tank, and we studied them.  the salt marsh is an important place because it's a habitat for many creatures.  it was a beautiful,sunny afternoon.  too beautiful and too sunnyas far as steve was concerned.   can you see it.  it's kind of bright.  stevarino. uncle dan.  can't look up. playing game.   kids.   george, i have some errands to run, but when i come back, we'll get supper.  so be a good little monkey and stay close, okay.  okay.  uncle dan, can i get a ride to the hardware store. i'm running out of batteries.  sure. it's my last delivery. i'll be right out.    ah, too bright.  come over here. i'll show you. mmm.    come on.   mmm.    uh, let's go in here.    hundley was pretty sure...  that monkeysshouldn't climb into trucks.   and he knew cats definitely didn't belong in trucks.   hmm. i wonder where steve went.  uh, beats me.  well, maybe he put down that game and went to play in the park.      they were closed in.    hundley knew it.  this was exactly the kindof thing that happened whenyou mixed monkeys with trucks.   i'm goin' all the way.  oh.  oh, no. steve's unclecouldn't hear him.  and george couldn't seewhere they were going.  maybe george could find a clueand figure it out.   oh.  here was a clue.  maybe they were picked upby a giant monster.  huh.  ah.  or maybe it was a car wash...  that the giant monsterwas holding.   gnocchi was gatheringher own clues.  she knew that smell could onlycome from one placethe chef's favorite fish market.  hundley wantedto gather clues too.  he knew that sound.  they must be goingthrough the doorman's lobby.  in fact, from whatthey saw, heard and smelled, everyone had a good ideaof where they were.  hey, i'm on mars.  well, almost everybody.     hey.the truck stopped.  finally, uncle danwould let them out, and theywould see where they'd gone.      huh.  steve's uncle was gone.     ah.   hundley thoughtthis was no timefor monkey business with boxes.       aha.   hundley couldn't waitto get back in his building.  but...where was his building.   hey.george wonderedwhere their building was too.   i did it.    i conquered the universe.   me. i have the skill. i have the power.  i have no idea where we are.  what happened. we're lost.   hang on, steve. snap out of it.  okay, you just flew a ship through three galaxies and captured six golden comets.  you're steve. if anyone can handle this, you can.  uh, don't worry, everyone.  i'm here. and i'm going to get us home.   we need to do this scientifically.  the way i see it, we could have come from three directions.  i call them direction "a", direction "b", or from that direction, which i haven't thought of a name for.  now, one of these three roads has to lead home.  the question is, which one.  hmm. only one way to find out.   eenie, meenie, miney, mo. catch a tiger by the if he hollers, let him go.   george thoughthe better find a clueif he ever wanted to get home.   a car wash.like the one from the truck.   my mother told me huh.  oh, now i have to start over.   maybe the truckhad gone through it,and this was the way home.  a car wash. i'm starting to remember something.  that's righta splashing sound.  oh, uhhuh.  come on.   aw, it's closed.  huh. i guess we couldn't have come this way after all.  oh.  just thenhundley heard a clue.  a bell.  hundley's superhearingwould lead the way home.   huh.    it wasn't a lobby bell.  but it sounded like the onehe heard on the truck.  wait a minute. hold the phone.  i remember now. i heard bells.  we came this way. i'm sure of it.  that sounded right to george.  but thenhe noticed something.  those bumps were somethinghe hadn't felt.  oh.  ooh.  they hadn't comefrom this direction.  cobblestones.  uhhuh.  wait, you guys. george is right.  if we came this way, we would have felt those.  believe me.  but we didn't.    that's when gnocchismelled a clue.   huh.   after that cat.  a fish market.   wait a minute. pause the music.  i remember now.  i smelled a strong fishy aroma right about the time i was passing pluto.    we must've come down this road.   uhoh.  dead end.  we couldn't have come from this direction.    face it. we have no idea where we came from.  we'll never find our way home now.  and george was out of clues.  and then he saw it.  the ferry.  it was splashy and shaky.   and hundley noticedit dinged like a bell.   and all around them,gnocchi smelled fish.   george realizedthey must have come overon the ferry.  oh, yeah, that's the ferry.  it carries cars fromfrom the city.  that's it. that's the way we must have oh, my gosh. it's leaving.  run. run. run.  stop. stop. stop. look both ways.  okay, all clear. run.   george.  gnocchi.  george neededto do something fast.    ah.  aha.  victory.  what a team. high five.   paw five.   we're like a team of superheroes.  with george's eyes, hundley's ears, gnocchi's nose...  and my, uh, brain, nothing can stop us.  at last, the ferry docked.they were almost home.  great. we'll be home in no time. follow me, team.  phew. made it.   hi, george.   well, i'm happy to see you too.  and so glad you did what i said and stayed close by.   well, hi there, boy.   hundley.  where have you been.  hey, george. want to play this game now.   uhuh.  yeah, you're right.  finding our way home was a lot more fun.  hey, let's do it again tomorrow.  huh.  yeah.  maybe you should tell me a little more about your day, george.  george and his friends useds usedtheir senses to find their way.  our friend kimdoes the same thing.  kim works at the perkinsschool for the blind, and she uses a guide dog. this is dolly.  she's not a pet.she's a working dog.  she's helping me to get aroundand to be independent.  kim does not have sight,  i have to rely on my other senses to know where i am.  do you know why i stopped right here.  tell me what you feel under your feet. bumps.  tectable warnings.   these bumps on the sidewalk are a way of using touch...  to alert me that we're almost to the street crossing.  hey, guys, do you smell something.  something smelled good didn't it.  where are we. we're at the bakery and the sandwich shop.   yes, exactly.  people can be blind, but they can also get around the same way people that are not blind do.  drums] vo: pbs kids goes to
