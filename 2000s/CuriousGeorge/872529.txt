 hi, everyone. hola.  what are you guys doing.  we're laying a picture puzzle game.  great. well, how does it work.  well, thispicture here goes with somethingup there.  this looks like a leaf, so it goes to a tree.  oh, i see.  well, i've got one for you.  what's this one a piece of.  it looks shiny.  is it a green car.  hmm. take a closer look.  see the pattern.  oh, yeah. they look like triangles.  i think it's a butterfly.  it is a butterfly. you did it.  you were able to figure out where this piece came from by putting all the parts together.  it's shiny, it's green, and it has triangle patterns on its wings.  pretty smart.  to this at home,ask an adult to find.  curious george'sbig picture game at pbsparents.org.  now let's havemath and science fun with our friendcurious

your reward    you'll never be bored    if you ask yourself,"what is this."    like curious...    like curious...curious george.   oh...  captioning sponsored bynbc/universal  narrator: when you wake up bleary eyed, normal things can look odd...  getting a drink of water.  uhhuh. ah.  ...and odd things, even odder.  well, i'm training in gravity boots.  tomorrow's the big day.  i'm scheduled to take my first rocket ride.  again.  uh, george, it's okay to look, just don't touch anything.    well, it's good to train for falling down, too...  i guess.   wiseman: good morning, boys.  ooh...  you remember professor einstein and professor pizza.  so, are you ready to become the first normal guy to walk in space.  no one on earth is more ready or more normal.  just ask my monkey.   uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.  well, you know your mission: repairing the einsteinpizza space telescope.  like this normal telescope, it makes far away things look closer.  ooh...  but our telescope is much bigger, so it can see much, much farther.  plus it's in outer space, beyond the ruinous interference of earth's atmosphere.  it gave us these amazing pictures of distant planets and nebulae.  stuff out in space.  hmm...  but the controls got stuck and now it only points at earth.  yes, in fact, it's aimed directly at professor pizza's kitchen window.  all we've gotten for a month are pictures of tony cooking, and one of his dog licking a cake.  and i didn't see that one till after we ate the cake.   ugh.  to repair the telescope, you'll replace four cubeshaped batteries.   here you go.   you will also replace three cylindershaped gyroscopes.  uhhuh, uhhuh.  gyroscopes help aim the telescope.  it's hard for you to understand.  i'll explain it another time.   sorry, george.  too complicated for little monkeys.  no, i... i meant you.  oh.  right.  you'll remove the telescope's grunsfeldsmith nut using this wrench.  when its lever is pushed to the left it spins left to loosen.    to tighten it again, push the lever to the right and it spins to the right.   wow, you hear that, george.  leftyloosey, rightytighty, even in space.  yeah.  wiseman: okay, it's time to launch.  so when i space walk, i go out this door, then close it behind me, just like at home.  you don't do anything.  we designed it so it closes and locks itself automatically after you exit.  well, how do i get back in.  i don't see a doorknob.  oh, there's a secret button, isn't there.  uh...  oh.  oh, don't tell me you didn't design a way for him to get back inside after the space walk.  the automatic locking door was pizza's idea.  no, the automatic closing door was mine.  he said, "let's make it lock, too." : we have to scrub the mission.  oh, no, please.  what if someone else goes with me and opens the door from inside.  there's no room for another man.  ooh.   wiseman : ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.  ignition.  george, we're in outer space together.  yeah.  wiseman : you are in position to activate our remote.  perfect.  we'll take it from here.  guided by the scientists, the rocket hooked onto the telescope.  ooh...  it was time for the space walk.  george, your job is to push this button and let me back inside.  uhhuh, uhhuh.  wiseman: okay, attach your tether.  this keeps me attached to the rocket while i'm outside.  uhoh.  einstein: who uhoh'd.  what's "uhoh".  um, the tether link ripped off my suit.  then you can't go outside.  oh, boy.  we have to scrub the mission.  oh, no.   let george do it. let george do it.    i know.  my job is to push this button and let you back inside.  uhhuh.  and don't forget, be a good little monkey space walker.  there's nothing a monkey likes better than a space walk.   wow.  that city kid really gets around.   george knew what he had to do firstremove the nuts using the wrench.  oh.  hey.  uh...  why didn't it move.  he knew the ruleleftyloosey...   and rightytighty.   he wasn't the first monkey to mix up his "loosey" and his "tighty," just the first one in space.  haha.  oh, did i mention george only has enough air to last two minutes.  well, you did now.  george, you must complete the mission expeditiously.  huh.  i mean, finish up and get back in the rocket, very quickly.  okay, uhhuh, uhhuh.  putting replacements in was pretty easy...  huh.  ...and then it wasn't.  aw...  aha.  maybe he needed to put this stuff in exactly where the old stuff was.  uhhuh, uhhuh.  oh, no. this last hole was a completely different shape.  ahh...  george, you need to head insidenow.  george.  i'm going out there after him.  you can't. you don't have a tether.  oh, boy.  huh...  uhhuh.  why, it wasn't a different shape at all.  uhhuh.  now he needed rightytighty.  man: george, you have only five seconds of air left.  that's it. i'm going out.  no.  you'll float out into space.  hi.  phew.  he made it. george is safe.  oh, yeah.  yay. yes, george.  george did it.  the telescope controls work again.  great work, guys.  you're coming home.  oh.  it wasn't two minutes.  it was an hour and two minutes.  heh. my mistake.    kid rl: george is a monkey, so he can do things that you can't do.  girl 2: he used tools to fix the telescope.  we are using tools for building.  boy: we're making a doghouse.  screwdriver.  this is flat head.  as you can see, it's flat.  and phillips head, it looks almost like a cross.  this can fit into a screw that matches.  boy: cooper is putting a bolt through the hole.  on the other side we put a nut on the bolt.  adone found an adjustable wrench.  girl: adone holds the nut on one side while cooper turns the bolt on the other side.  rightytighty, leftyloosey.  girl: that is the same thing that curious george learned, and so cooper is turning it to the right to tighten.   narrator: all you needed was ears to know betsy's birthday party was in full swing.  let me try one time.   of all the party sights, sounds, smells and tastes...  one thing caught george's interest...   hah...  and it smelled like... candy.  like my piata, george.  uhhuh.   i'm glad you like it, because it's time to break it.  huh.  uhuh.  george, it's a game.  whoever breaks it, wins the candy inside.  oh...  oh. ahh....   you want to go first.  uhhuh.  you have to hit the piata with the bat.   hold on.  huh.  you're not ready yet.  ha. huh.  oh... uh... uh... ohhh...  okay, give it your best whack.   come on, george.  you can do it.  come on.  missed.  oh...  try again.  yeah.   huh.    oh, no. oh, steven.  move the bird...   ...house. oh...  never mind.    george was sure he'd whacked that piata by now.  heh.  george: huh.  uhoh.  well, this is a good time to make lemonade.  everyone inside.   i think george feels a little shy about...  about smashing the place up.  aunt margaret: about not winning.  could you please ask him to rejoin the party.  steve: can i sit with you.  if i go in, i have to keep waiting on my little sister and her little friends.  you know, i could show you how to whack a piata the right way.  huh.   sure. it'd give me a reason to stay out here longer.  you always play followtheleader with charkie all over the neighborhood, right.  uhhuh. uhhuh.  play now. except, do it without seeing her.  huh.  go on, charkieyou're leader.   george knew that sound.   that's right. follow her.    ooh. ah...  oh. ya gotta figure out how to avoid walking into trees.  without looking.  aww...  hey, do you want to get good at this and win piata candy or what.  uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.  i'll get us some lemonade.  watching you run around is making me thirsty.  keep following her while i'm gone.  okay.  charkie got quiet, so george concentrated on listening.   aha.   if there was one thing charkie loved more than escaping, it was follow the leader.   steve was right.  george could tell exactly where charkie was.  i'm glad i don't have to be in there.  i'm too old and too smart to be playing.  uhoh.  george. charkie.  say, steve.  you looking for charkie.  yeah. did you see her.  was george with her.  which way did they go.  that way.   george was doing great.  he was able to follow charkie everywhere with his ears.   but it wasn't easy.  there were so many sounds in the city, all happening at the same time.  oh... no. uhuh.  he wasn't going to peek.  he was going to do this right.  charkie was right ahead of him, so maybe, if he kept going...   aha.  did a black dog flip by followed by a blindfolded monkey.  you mean there's nothing wrong with my glasses.  which way did they go.     oh.  where was he.  these things didn't feel familiar.  what were they for.   what's that sound.  sounds like our hose.  all: our hose..  george, did you pull the pump valves.  had george lost charkie.  nothing he touched felt furry, and he didn't hear her.   ah. but his nose knew that wet dog aroma.  she was close by.  ahhahahaha.     why don't we get any normal visitors here.   she was hiding again, but george knew how to find a silent, wet dog.  ahhahaha.    fur.  aha.  he'd caught up with charkie.  but it didn't smell like a wet dog.  and this dog was too small to be charkie.  meow.  this dog was a cat.   oh.  delicious smell plus a cat.  he knew exactly where he was: with gnocchi at chef pisghetti's place.  a place with great food is exactly where charkie would go.   chef pisghetti: oh, no. what have you done..  my pasta.  you know, normally, if i heard yelling followed by crashing, i'd worry it's george, but he's at a party.    did a black dog flip by followed by a blindfolded monkey.  how come everybody in town has seen them but i can't find them.    it wasn't so noisy here.  and there was grass.  why, even blindfolded, he knew he was in endless park.   and that wet dog smelled close.  george smelled and touched, and found something that felt like charkie.   when he heard her bark, he knew it was charkie.   i searched everywhere.  i can't find george and charkie.  did you look there.  now, just take one swing this time, okay.  this time, george didn't just use the bat.  he used sound...   aha.  and touch...   and smell.   i taught him everything he knows.  george had used all his senses except one to find the piata, and that one was taste.  girl: george is a monkey, so he can do thingboy: george is a monkey, so he can do things that we can't do.  he used his ears to find sharky.  we are practicing seeing, hearing and feeling.  we're trying to learn about our senses.  keep on going.  stop, stop.  put your hands out.   today we are not doing our morning sharing the usual way.  we're going to have sharing that's gonna be totally silent.  if you can't hear, you can use your eyes.  everybody had to listen to her.  they had to listen to her fingers and see what they were doing.  uh, you painted a heart.  first, julia would do her signs.  and then we would ask her questions.  was it made out of something you can squish.  is it clay.  you pretty much have it.  kids: oh....  curious george loves learning new things.  so what if we learn how to count to 3 in spanish.  first, we know how to count to 3 in english, right.  that was easy.  now let's try itin spanish. ready.

put your hands out.   today we are not doing our morning sharing the usual way.  we're gonna have sharing that's gonna be totally silent.  we're trying to learn about our senses.  if you can't hear, you can use your eyes.  everybody had to listen to her.  they had to listen to her fingers and see what they were doing.  uh, you painted a heart.  first, julia would do her signs.  and then we would ask her questions.  was it made out of something you can squish.  is it clay.  you pretty much have it.  kids: oh....  then we had kids trying to eat gelatin.  blindfolded.  i know where my mouth is.   missed.  if you can't see, you can't feel things.  they learn to feel if there is too much in the spoon.  there's lots of ways to use your senses.  can i have more.   for more fun withcurious george
