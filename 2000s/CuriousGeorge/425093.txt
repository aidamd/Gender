"pair of mittens bought by monkeyprice: $100"..   excuse me, ii need to speak with my monkey.  : george, a hundred dollars is a lot of money.  ah. yeah.  uh, how to explain this.  hmm.  let's pretend this kernel of popcorn is a dollar.  so that's the money you have...  uhhuh.  ...andthisis how much money you need.  uh, more or less.  huh.  ten kernels of popcorn equals ten dollars.  so this line here is ten dollars.  to get to 100, you need ten rows of ten. see.  ten...  twenty...  ...thirty...  forty...  ...fifty...  sixty...  seventy...  eighty...  ninety...  one hundred.  ah.  wow, that's a lot.   george was remembering how hard he worked to earnonedollar.  he had to wash mike the pig.  tada.   twice.   to make enough money to pay for the mittens, george would have to wash mike 100 times...  at least.   that was a lot of pig.  i know.  we'll tell mrs. nguyen you made a mistake and thought the mittens were onlyonedollar.  mrs. nguyen is nice.  she wouldn't make you pay a hundred dollars if she knew you made a mistake.   but... one dollar's a lot less than $100.  the library wouldn't be able to buy as many books.  so... we should auction the mittens again, and mr. glass can buy them for $101.  oh, good idea, marco.  i am always thinking.   sold... for $22.50...   to the lovely lady in red.    okay, ii need to rest my voice anyway.   i'm gonna go get some water while the monkey tries to resell his mittens.  you got five minutes.   ookay, so the bidding will start at $100.  heh. george.      hey.  why isn't mr. glass bidding.  here, let me try.  uh, did you notice these mittens have elephants.  yeah. uhhuh, uhhuh.  and they're red.  and...hehheh, there are two of them.   right.  one for each hand.  or foot.   tada.  he's still not bidding.   man: uh, mr. glass isn't there.  uhoh. time was running out.  if george didn't get these mittens sold, a hundred pigs were going to be very clean.  uhoh.  i'll look for mr. glass.  you keep trying to sell the mittens.   tada.  look, they're not just mittens, they're earmuffs.  there he is.  mr. glass.   excuse me.   you know, these are handknit mittens, knitted by handsbythese hands, in fact.  um, perhaps you can tell us something about your technique.  yes.  i use yarn...  ...and knitting needles.   mr. glass.  my bike.  mr. glass.  mr. glass.   do you still want those red mittens.  oh, absolutely.  i love those mittens.  they're unique.  great.  because george doesn't have a hundred dollars, so he put them up for auction again so you could buy them and the library could get $101, only now there's only one minute of bidding time left.  one minute.  how are we going to get to the auction in one minute.   man: right, there are two of them, aand the wool is from averynice sheep named carmen.  ha, ha, ha.  let's face it.  no one's going to buy those mittens.   mr. glass: stop...   ...those mittens.  i'll pay a hundred and one dollars.  auctioneer: sold.     this was great.  the library had a hundred and one dollars...   ...and george didn't have to wash a hundred pigs.   still, he would miss his mittens.   don't worry, george, i'll knit you another pair of mittens with giraffes.  ooh.   aha, ooh.   boy: the man with the yellow hat showed george how much 100 is.  girl: we are using stuff to help us count to 100.  teacher: today we're going to show curious george how to count to 100 that you have brought in from home.  this is 100 beads.  boy 2: it looks like less than 100.  you need it organized to really prove how much it is.  girl 2: we glued ten in each row...  ah.  ...to count by tens.  ten groups of ten to get to a hundred.  boy 3: i have got 100 ounces of cranberry juice here.  girl 1: he measured out 20 ounces at a time.  boy 4: yeah, that's perfect.  girl 3: and we poured it into a container which was marked by 20s up to a hundred ounces.  yes.  yes.  yes.  i think we did help curious george learn what a hundred really is.    narrator: monkeys don't get chicken pox.   i wish i were a monkey.  huh.  but little girls do, which is why george was going to the opera instead of betsy.  oh, you guys are so lucky.  aw, no, we're not.  operas are boring.  ugh.  don't pay any attention to him, george.  hansel and gretelis wonderful.  it's magical.   listen.  isn't that pretty.  uhhuh.  yeah, pretty high.   shh, this is my favorite part of my favorite opera.  it's where the dew fairy helps hansel and gretel.  oh.  isn't she beautiful.   they only do this opera every few years, and i have to miss it.   oh, we're all going to miss it if we don't hurry.  have fun.  promise you'll tell me all about it.   ooh.    oh... sorry, iit's my monkey's first opera.    brother, come and dance with me    both my hands i offer thee    right foot first, left foot, then    roundabout and back again...   george thought the boy and girl must be hansel and gretel.   i would dance but don't know how    when to jump or when to bow    show me what i ought to do    so that i may dance like you    with your foot, you tap, tap, tap    with your hands, you clap, clap, clap    right foot first, left foot, then    roundabout and back again.   the opera was everything betsy had said it would be.  hansel and gretel danced and played in a magical forest.  ah.  there was a sandman who lived in a tree...   ...who made them fall asleep.   and a dew fairy who woke them up.  then they found a house you could eat, but the house belonged to a sry witch who wanted to eat them.   hocus pocus, now comes jocus    children, watch the magic head    eyes are staring, dull as lead.   but hansel and gretel outsmarted the witch.   the spell is broke, and we are free...   ooh...  her spell was broken, and all the gingerbread men turned back into kids.   join hands together...    good job.   wow.  steve: oh, it was incredible.  yeah.   george liked it so much, he got the music.   wow.  i just wish i could have gone with you.  crummy chicken pox.    ah.  here.  this'll keep your head dry.   hey, george, you look like you could be in betsy's opera.  did he.  huh.  oh, uhhuh.  he sure did.  in fact, he could be all the people in betsy's opera.  he could do the opera for betsy all by himself.   the first thing george needed were costumes.    next, he needed the music.  uh, what's going on.   you want to listen to the opera now.  uhhuh, uhhuh.  uh, george why is there a duster on your head.      oh, i get it.  since betsy missed the opera, you want to act it out for her.    brother, come and dance with me    both my hands i offer thee    right foot first, left foot, then    roundabout and back again.   whoa.  aah.  this was going to be harder then he thought.  ow.  man: what do you think, george.  better.  uhhuh.   george had enough trouble playingonepart.  how was he going to play them all.  hmm...  and then george realized, he had the whole cast right at his fingertips.  now they just needed costumes.   he'd have to figure it out tomorrow.  tonight he was too sleepy.  ah.     finger puppets worked great.  the actors could come on and go off in a flash.  but hansel and gretel were the same size as their parents.  george needed something bigger for the adults.  hmm.  i picked up the laundry.  you want to help me sort it.  ooh. uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.  hey.   ah...  uh...  no wonder none of my socks match.  yeah.  the smiley sock could be the sandman.   ah. lookin' good.  the oven mitts could be mother and father.   wh... now, what did i do with those mitts.     but he still needed a witch and a dew fairy.   huh.  ah.  maybe this could be the witch.    now, where was he going to find a dew fairy.  hmm...  she would have to be magical...  and pretty and sweet and...  hey.   george knew just the girl for the job.  once the puppets were done, george needed to create the sets.  uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.    ah.     but george couldn't work puppets and sets at the same time.  his sets had to be easy to move.  ah.   george taped the pictures he had drawn onto the paper roll.  george's opera was ready to roll.  george wants to know if we can come over.  he has a surprise for betsy.  hey...  what is this.  : shh. the show's about to start.  betsy: show.  gretel:  brother, come and dance with me   betsy: is that hansel and gretel.   right foot first, left foot, then   how cute.   roundabout and back again.       and gladly watch above them, shh...   betsy : there's the sandman.  and there they go, off to sleep.   here comes my favorite part.  the dew fairy.   i'm up with early dawning    and know who loves the morning   it's me.  i'm the dew fairy.   who'll rise fresh as a daisy    who'll sink in slumber lazy.    wow.   children, watch the magic head   ooh, the scary witch.  oh, be careful.   eyes are staring, dull as lead     now you atom, off to bed.    we thank, we thank you both.    oh, that was great, george.   that was so great, george.  betsy: thank you.  it was so fantastic, i even forgot to itch.   still sorry you missed the opera.  no. i'm sure george's was much better.  it does make me wonder, though.   how do you feel about... ballet.  ah...  ah.  girl: george made a finger puppet opera.  rl: george made finger puppet opera.  we are visiting a puppet studio to make hand puppets.  i'm going to steal all the corn.  maggie is the creator of magpie puppets.  so, this puppet is made out of little boxes, i'm gonna make a turtle.  i'm gonna make a bear.  i'm gonna make a horse.  girl: we start with boxes, then we use glue to cover the boxes with felt.  and we're gonna put duct tape
