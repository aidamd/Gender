 here. try usingthis magnifying glass.  whoa. look at all those squiggly lines.  my fingers look big.  magnify means to make things look biggermas grande.  what else is tiny that you could make look bigger by seeing it through a magnifying glass.  these marbles look like big, bouncy balls.  what about stars.  well, stars are a little too far away, and magnifying glasses work on things that are close by.  can we do it on little, tiny ants.  excelente.  you can use a magnifying glass to look at insects, or leaves, or even words in a book.  for more, ask an adult to find sid the science

yourself, "what is this."    like curious...    like curious...  curious george.   oh...  captioning sponsored by nbc/universal narrator: for city heritage week, the man with the yellow hat repainted the endless park statue.   and george helped.  oh, missed a spot.  thanks, george.     my yellow hat.   aha.  huh. ooh.  ooh.  thank you, george.  what're you looking at.  spiderwebs.   spiders spin those webs with special spider silk.  they live there.  oh...  uhhuh, and the webs catch their food.   hold it.  spiders don't eat apples.  they eat small insects and flies.  george didn't want to eat flies, but he liked spiderwebs so much...  ooh.  ...that he wondered why he couldn't make a monkeyweb, which would catch monkey food.   oh, no. if it's caught in your web, it's yours to keep.   ooh.   oh, okay. see you later.   uhoh, i hope my paint dries before it rains.  george couldn't wait to start making a monkeyweb.  but how does a monkey make a web.  first, george looked for things that seemed webby.  like thread.   george's thread web didn't look bad at all.     george, it's going to rain.  can you take some tarps over to the park to protect that statue so it doesn't get wet.  uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.     hundley, you knocked down george's whateverthing.   you know, at first i thought it was a big spiderweb.   i'll get those tarps out of the basement for you.  hmm.  thread looked good, but george wanted something stronger.  rubber bands felt strong.  this looked good, too, but was it stronger than a dachshund.    yea.  yup, it passed the dachshund test.  george wanted to show hundley what the web was for.   the second web was strong, but it did the opposite of catching fruit.  twine was strong, not rubbery, and it was all he had left.   this was the best looking web of all, but would food stick to it.  it would if he made it sticky.   uhhuh.  and what's stickier than honey.  ooh.  the lady from down the hall was coming home with food.  this would be the perfect test for his monkeyweb.   nice web, george.  playing spider.  uhhuh.   all right, spider monkey, here comes a big fly.  huh.  food didn't stick to the web.  and the web couldn't stick to the wall...  ooh.  because george was too heavy.  ooh.  there you go, hundley.  maybe you should leave webmaking to the spiders, huh, george.   doorman: don't worry.  we'll clean this up.  you get those to the park.  okay.  hurry.   mmm... mmm.  doorman: hundley.  don't lick the giant spiderweb.  you don't know where it's been.   maybe a monkey making a giant web was just some impossible dream.     all that mattered right now was getting to the man with the yellow hat before it rained.   oh, no.  this is going to be ruined.   george.  are these to cover the statue.  uhhuh. uhhuh.  wow. you even brought plenty of extrastrong tape, so it won't blow away.  thanks. you really saved the day.    ooh.  did he say extrastrong tape.   you want that.  uhhuh.  sure.  i have plenty.  maybe george didn't have to give up on his monkeyweb yet.  here was a chance to see how an expert did it.  aha.    phew.    george, let's get home before we get caught in the rain.  oh. hey, what's this.   well, that is a pretty good monkeyweb, george.   it looked good, but could it catch anything.   oh.  aah.  what.. let go.   no, no, no.   oh, no.  oh. oh...  uh... can we help.  oh, yes, please.  this is my grandfather's collection of antique postcards.  they're priceless.  we'll never get them all.   no.  oh, it's hopeless.  the museum wanted to display them.  now they're going to be lost.  george: hey.   oh my. what luck that this big, sticky webthing was here.  oh, that wasn't luck.  thatwas a monkey.   oh... rain.  i've got to recover that statue, now.  ugh. and i'd better get these to the museum, fast.  thanks again.        the spiderwebs had to be saved from the storm too.  making webs was hard.  george was impressed little spiders could do such amazing things.  george got rid of the rainy day...  and gave him a sunny mountain view.  child: geor girl: george is a monkey, so sometimes he does things that you can't do.  boy: his web didn't really work to catch food.  hmm...  my name's gino.  i'm a gloucester fisherman, standing on the dock of the gloucester maritime heritage center.  this here is called a dragnet.  and it goes on the bottom of the ocean.  the fish will swim into here, and they'll go right to the end.  and they can't get out, 'cause the end is closed.  this is my boat, kids, and it's called thegolden banana.  boy: that is just so cool.  gino: the lobster comes in the net.  he eats the bait from the bait net, drops into the trap, finds out he can't get out this way. he backs up into the parlor net.  and once he's getting back in here, he's in the parlor.  and now he can't get out.  this is what we call a gill net.  the little guys go right through, look.  boy: if we catch all the small fish, they'll never turn into big fish.  and then there will never be any more fish.  gino: the bigger ones get in and they get stuck.  boy: if we didn't have fishing nets, it would be pretty hard to catch fish.  narrator: bill and george went fishing almost every day since summer began, so they weren't about to let a crisp fall day stop them.  hey, george.  ready to go.  uhhuh.   george.  wear your jacket.  it's cool out there.      you got to stay still, george.  you're going to scare the fish.  who could sit still in an itchy jacket.   ah.  this was much better...   ooh.  ...but a little chilly.  narrator make that really cold.  know what.  i think it's turned too cold for fishing.  : uhhuh.   i can tell you don't like wearing that coat.  too bad you were born a city kid and not a bear.   bears don't go out in the cold.  they sleepallwinter.   it's called "hibernation." bears eat a whole bunch of food in fall, and then they sleep till spring.  oh.   if he hibernated, george wouldn't have to wear an itchy coat.   this monkey was ready to go bear.  oh. you're back fast.  too cold.  uhhuh.   : yeah.  i bet you were glad you wore your jacket, huh.  ah.    oh.  george got to work preparing for his hibernation...  ...by eating as much as he could.  ooh. uhhuh.    oh.  oh.  george couldn't even eat one more grape.    ooh.  it was hibernatin' time.  oh. oh.  oh.     he ate as much as he could.   oh.  so why wasn't george hibernating.  oh.   how did bears do it.  maybe he wasn't trying hard enough.  oh. oh....  of course he couldn't fall asleep.  ahha.  he knew it was daytime.  george could fix that.   uhhuh.  now when he glanced at the window, it would look like bedtime.  ahha.   but seeing stars wasn't enough.  the room was too bright.  ah.  huh.    oh.   this wasn't working, either.   how did bears do it.  oh.  george had to find out.   hmm. oh.  what's up, george.  you want to show me something.  uhhuh.    um, teddy's sleeping.  uhhuh, uhhuh.   how does sleep work.  whoa.  ii, uh... i thought you'd ask that when you were, you know, a little older.  um, let me get my science book.   not sleep.   just teddy.  uhhuh.  a bear.  uhhuh.  how do bears sleep.  uhhuh, uhhuh.  do bears sleep in the woods.   hibernation.  uhhuh.  well, to hibernate, first, bears eat a lot.  uhhuh.  then go into their dark, quiet caves, and they...   glad i could help.  george's room was already dark like a cave, so he added bats.  mmhmm.   and rocks.    now his room was exactly like a cave.   oh.  except caves were quiet.    hey.   george didn't know whose dog this was, but he knew what stopped charkie from barking: peanut butter.      now it would be quiet enough.   well, no more peanut butter.  how could he quiet the cows.  shh.   shh.   shh.        ooh.   oh.    hey.    he couldn't hold the blanket on his ears in his sleep, but maybe there was another way to use it to keep sounds out.   huh. ah.  now his cave was dark andquiet.   ah.   ooh.    oh.  hey, listen to this, george.  i've got that tough part down.    ooh, cool muted sound.    finally, everything was perfect for monkey hibernation.  when george woke up, it would be springtime.         ooh.  when george woke up, he realized he'd done it.  he had hibernated.   six months must have passed.  ooh. ah.   his goldfish looked bigger.  that meant, outside it was spring.   ah.   nothing was growing yet.  it must have been early spring.  oh.   good morning, george.  huh.  well, that wasn't much of a welcome back after a whole hibernation.  well, i was thinking of making banana nut pancakes for breakfast, but you ate all the bananas yesterday.  huh.  yesterday.  oh.  george only hibernated one night.  oh.  well, he'd just have to go back to bed and try harder.  oops.   well, it seemed like time to get the winter stuff out.  just happened a little faster than i intended.  wait a minute.   ah.  george forgot about the winter stuff.  skis.  oh. ah.  sleds.  hey.   ooh.  his monkey mittens.  no way did george want to sleep through winter and miss using all this fun stuff.  oh. oh.   maybe someday bears would wake up and see what they're missing.  george: ah.  child: george is a monkey, girl: george is a monkey, so sometimes he does things that we can't do.  boy: he tried to make his room dark like a bear's cave.  we are making a fort.  boy: it's exactly what george is trying to do, make it dark and make it kind of like a cave.  and then do, like, shadow puppets after that.  boy: so, you would just cover up all the holes with tape so the light wouldn't come in.  boy: you can't use clear tape, miles.  it's gonna send in light, so we need to use this dark tape.  start building the roof.  boy: we are putting pieces of cardboard on topfor the roof.  boys: whoa.   is it dark enough for shadow puppets.  i think it's dark enough.  boy: we got a flashlight to make shadows.   girl: that one looks like a chicken screaming.  curious george sure has a lot of friends, both people and animals.  hey. let's play a game.  what animal goes, "tweet tweet".  kids: a bird.  a bird. right.  in spanish, pajaro.  and what animal goes, "ooh ooh ooh eeh eeh eeh".  kids: a monkey.  in spanish, mono,just like curious george, and you can play a lotof
