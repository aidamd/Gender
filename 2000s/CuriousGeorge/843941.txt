.  oh...  captioning sponsored by nbc/universal  narrator: neither rain...  nor snow...   ...nor charkie...  could keep george from watching his favorite band, lobos de plata, perform in endless park.  . .   gracias.  thank you so much.  and now i'd like to ask if george would come onstage and play with us.   huh. me.  you. yes.  our number one fan.  come on up.   hola,george.  i have a drum for you.  ooh. heh. ah.  hit it, marco.  . .  every weekend after that, george couldn't wait to play with the band, until one day...   huh.    sorry, but the bandstand had to come down.  it was old and unsafe.   george felt bad for marco and his other friends in the band.  he decided he'd better go warn them right away.  except...  he had no idea where they lived.  hmm.  ooh.   george did know that they sometimes played in the plaza del sol subway station.  he decided he'd look for them there.  george was at endless park.  plaza del sol was the next stop.  ah.  so all he had to do was take the subway uptown.   this was plaza del sol, all right...  but the band wasn't here.  maybe they were upstairs somewhere.  george: oh. oh.  george had never seen or smelled a street as interesting as this.  is that you, george.  hi.  what are you doing here.    i think you're saying that they took down our bandstand.  uhhuh.  i know.  we were sad when they told us, and i wanted to tell you, but i didn't know where you lived.  this is where i live.  hey, do you want to have lunch.  my mom is making tacos and burritos.  uhhuh.  a hungry monkey never refuses an invitation to eat tacos and burritos, even if he didn't know what they are.  the tacos have meat.  oh...  the burritos are vegetable and cheese wrapped in a tortilla.  buen provecho.  mmm.  that's my mom maritza. and you know my dad luis, and my uncle felix, and my sister cecilia.  marco tells me you're feeling sad about the bandstand, george.  we are sad, too.  cecilia: yeah.  we tried playing in the street this morning, but it was too noisy.  it's worse than the subway.  it was nice to have a place where people could actually hearour music.  hmm.  eating great food, talking about musicit reminded george of the last time he'd been at pisghetti's.    do you have a place in mind, george, where people can hear us.   . .  waiter: excuse me.  coming through.  excuse me, georgio.  isn't it great.  everyone has come to hear the band.  pisghetti's might be fine for a man with a violin who could go up to each table to be heard, but it wasn't working for a whole, entire band.  george and marco decided to find a place that wasn't crowded or noisy.   you live here.  yeah.  oh...  hola, perro.   george really hoped the lobby would work.  that way, he could hear the band all the time.  so you think if we sound good in here, then the whole band will sound good.  uhhuh.    to george's surprise, they didn'tsound good.  they sounded sort of... muffled.  except to hundley.   george thought they'd sound less muffled at the zoo.  there weren't anycurtains or carpets.   but the lions were a little loud.  there were no lions or carpets at the railway station, and the room was big enough for a band.   too bigthe high ceiling made it difficult to hear the music.  the bridge reminded george of the bandstand.   but it was a little too echoey.   okay, so we need a room big enough for the band but not toobig, a high ceiling, but not toohigh, and no lions or carpets or waiters.   hi, george.  oh.  hi.  and hello, friend of george's.  hola.  are you coming to the opening tonight.  "marvels of the maya."  it's our biggest archeological exhibit ever.  there'll be food and lots of people.  bring your friends.  lots of people.  was marco thinking what george was thinking.   wait.  yes.  um, do you think you might want...  some music tonight.  my family has a band.  music..  oh, fantastic idea.  7:00.  see you then.   haha.  wow.  this is huge.  hi there.  thanks so much for coming.  play anywhere you want.  adios.  uh...  hey, maybe we should just play right here.   george is right.  this room is too big.  and this is like george's lobbytoo much carpet.  uhhuh.   the food court reminded them of pisghetti's.    once again, the lions were too loud.  finally, next to the trex, the band found a perfect spot.   nice.  is it the dinosaur that makes us sound so good.  george knew it wasn't the dinosaur.  it was the size of the room, no carpet on the floor, and the height of the ceiling.  this is a little tune we wrote called "hooray for george." . he's furry, he's sweet, quite light on his feet .  . he's got a smile for you and anholafor me .  . we don't know what he'll say, but he'll brighten your day .  . with a big monkey grin, well, he can show you the way .  . so hooray for george, bravo, viva. .  . you clap and i'll sing, let's make this song really swing .  . so hooray for george, bravo, viva. .  . nothing beats the spunky that a monkey can bring .  . he likes all our songs and he bounces along .  . we have so much fun that we can hardly go wrong .  . so when it's time to play, we give a great big ol. .  . he's our number one fan and we all want to say .  . hooray for george, bravo, viva. .  . you clap and i'll sing, let's make this song really swing .  . so hooray for george, bravo, viva. .  . nothing beats the spunky that a monkey can bring .  . nothing beats the spunky that a monkey can bring .  . nothing beats the spunky .  . that a monkey can bring. .   all right.  hey, where can we see you play next.  we don't really have a place to play, not since they tore down the bandstand.  all: aw...  hold it, hold it, hang on.  this band is unique.  if george is your number one fan, then i'm your number two, which is why i've just decided to build a new bandstand, and i'd like you to perform on opening day.  really.  okay, it's a deal.   thank you, thank you, and welcome to the allnew glass bandstand.   please welcome lobos de plata.  hit it, george.    thanks to the new bandstand, lobos de plata sounded great, even when hundley joined in.  boy: george is a monkey.  he tried to find a goodsounding place to play music with marco.  today we're going to talk about sound.  you say "hey." hey.  teacher: the sound makes the waves in the air.  girl: and we are trying to find the best place to record reading.  boy: we want to find a place that is quiet and has no loud echo.  : hey.  the word is echoing.  the stairwell had too much of an echo.  : hey.  then we listened to the kitchen.  the noise is coming from over there, so this is not a very good room to record.  teacher: and then there's another group going into tina's room.  hey.  boy: there's no echo or noise.  it's perfect for recording.  girl 2: "then the mother bunny sat down.  "she saw something and george saw it, too.  something went..."    narrator: it was george's first spring day back in the country...   ...and already he was starring in a movie.  hiya, mr. renkins.   hi, bill, george.  okay, george, you go in first and see if there are any baby ducks running around.  uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.   i'll follow with my camcorder.   this will make a great scene for my science project about baby animals.  this is bill, bringing you baby ducks live from the renkins' barn.  oh...    hey.  we're in luck.  the ducklings haven't hatched yet.  they're still inside their eggs.  huh.   sure, georgelook.  you and me and other mammals come into the world as babies.  but birdsducks, for examplecome as eggs.  oh.  uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.  yep, dumpling's babies will hatch from these eggs as long as she sits on them to keep them warm.  huh.  sprout's honor, george.  if she doesn't sit on them, they'll get cold and never hatch.  oh.   my battery died.  i'll have to get another one.  don't let the eggs hatch without me, okay.   ah...    huh.   where was dumpling going.  she was supposed to be keeping her eggs warm.       sheesh.  uhoh.          the eggs were still warm, but if dumpling didn't come back soon...   george decided that if dumpling wasn't going to sit on her eggs, he'd have to do it.   carefully.  whew.   well, sitting on a nest, hatching eggs, is actually pretty boring.    bill: thanks for loaning me a battery, sir.  no problem.  i think that's great you're filming a duck hatching.  oh.    this i've got to get on tape.  bill here, bringing you a firsta city kid sitting on a nest of duck eggs.  george, why are sitting on a nest of duck eggs.     aha.  it looks like he's trying to keep dumpling's eggs warm.  uhhuh.   huh.  george: ooh.   wow.  i don't believe it.  a duck is hatching right before my very eyes...  on camera.  uh, mr. and mrs. renkins, you don't want to miss this.  your ducks are hatching.  both: we'll be right there.   ooh.  george: ooh.    bill: you saw it here, folksa city kid hatched a duckling.  well, look at that.  isn't that amazing.   . tada. .     all the eggs are hatching.     oh, it thinks you're its mother, george.  yeah, you'd better get that tyke back to his nest so he can get to know his duck mom.    there's the proud mother dumpling duck and here's the fourth duckling being reunited with its family.   uhhuh...   aw...     uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.   did the duckling think george was its mother.  quack, quack.  quack, quack.     : george... what are you...  hey.    no, no, no, no...   ooh, bebe...  be careful, little fella.    george had to set this duckling straight.  his mother was a duck, not a monkey.    maybe we'd better go home, george.  i'm sure your little duckling will be a regular duck family member by tomorrow.     don't worry, george, your duckling will adapt.  this is bill, signing off until tomorrow.   the next morning, george was eager to see how his duckling was doing with his new duck family.  here we are on day two of...  the duckling chronicles.   look at that.  the fourth duckling is with its...  oops.  spoke too soon.        bill: the duckling still thinks george is its mother.  georgehadto show the duckling that monkeys are one thing and ducks are another.   see.  : and you...  quack, quack.  quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack.   you make an excellent duckling, george.   this was getting nowhere.  george decided to try another approach.   farmer lifemagazine.  how isthat going to help.   george wanted to show the duckling that in a typical duck family there aren't any monkeys.     that wasn't working, either.   maybe if george showed him how to act, the duckling would get the idea.   bill: it looks like george is trying the "make like a duck" maneuver.      uhoh.         help.         hooray for the dumplings.  oh. i should get this on tape.  bill: you're watching dumpling duck saving her baby like only a mother duck can.     bill: and so the ducklings were brought together by this daring rescueandby the kid from the city who helped to hatch them.  fanttic.    aw...      bye.    aw...   this is bill...  and the city kid...  george: byebye.   bill: ...bringing you one totally happy ending.  girl: george is a monkey.  girl: george is a monkey.  he learned how a mother duck raises ducklings.   oh, there's some ducks.  today we're looking at the ducks.  we've been finding out what ducks do.  there, there, there, there.  it's called "mallard" duck.  mallard.  mallard duck.  i think that the mom duck is trying to keep the ducklings safe.   these guys are much smaller.  i think they're much younger.  when they first hatch, they're very fuzzy.  they look so cute, upclose.  they're dabbling ducks.  it means they just put their beak on theurface of the water.  girl: sometimes they duck their head underwater to look for food, or maybe they look on land.  boy: she took them onto land.  girl: nature is fun to watch because you could learn new things and new facts.  hey, look who it is.  tada. the cat in the hat.  it's the cat in the hat on pbs kids.  get ready to take off.  look.straight ahead.  ..
