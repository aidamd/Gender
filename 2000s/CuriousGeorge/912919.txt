curious...  curious george.   oh...  captioning sponsored by nbc/universal   here they come, hundley.  huh.   ohh...  announcer: hundley forgot today was the day they promised to take george out on their neat, orderly boat.  your buddy george is coming aboard, hundley.  hello.   we're both excited about this.  we even bought matching life vests.  uhhuh.  you guys look very snappy.  let's stow your stuff, george.  okay.  ahh...   well, here we go.  huh.  no sail yet, george.  we use a small motor to get in and out of the docks.  oh.  okay, we're ready to set sail.   huh.     oh, that's just a little crack.  i'm getting it fixed tomorrow.  oh, okay.  it didn't seem possible foronemonkey to mess up a whole boat so hundley decided to enjoy the trip.  look. school of dolphins ahead.   you can see if you're up higher.  ohh...  yeah.   george, be careful.  h...   oh.  huh.   you all right, george.    should it do that.  no.  we'd better head home before it gets worse.  sorry, guys.  aw...   hundley was relieved.  the sooner they got home, the less george could make a mess of things.   if we stop at wilson's island, i can reinforce the boom so we can sail back without worrying.  great.    yeah, that is weird.  palm trees don't grow in this part of the world, do they.  no, mr. wilson brought in rocks, shells, and trees from the tropics...  to create an exotic island home.  wow.  so mr. wilson lives here.  no, he never moved in, so now it's a deserted tropical island, like you read about.    wilson brought that, too.  there's nowhere else like this within 5,000 miles of here.  come on.  let's get some wood, leaves, and vines to reinforce the boom.  we'll be right back.     that sand looked messy.  hundley decided to wait in the clean boat.   george had a chance to collect shells...   ...and some unusual rocks.    ooh.    huh.   george remembered seeing that thing on the boat.  it must have fallen out.        so, back to the boat.  let's find one more thick vine.  okay.   uhoh.  oh...     since hundley was an experienced sailor, george followed his lead.   unfortunately, the wind blew the wrong way.  both: huh.    they worked as a team...  and found out they were a really bad team.  oh...    george figured if they lowered the sail, they'd stop blowing away.   the island stopped getting further away, but then the fog rolled in.   wow, it sure got foggy fast.  yeah.  hey, where's my boat.  oh, no.  george.  hundley.  george and hundley were fogbound.    another island.   how could they get there without blowing away again.    ah.  uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh the motor.  george: oh.     uhhuh.   george had a feeling he should have left this where it was.    sure, sand was messy, but hundley would rather be dirty than float away again.  now, they couldn't have gotten far.  the water's too deep.  we can't follow them without another boat.  both: or a raft.  come on.  we'll need more wood and vines.   narrator: if he was going to be stuck here, hundley wasn't going to sit in sand the whole time.     huh.   that was when george realized he had no idea how to get back to the man with...  without the yellow hat.  okay, we'll need just a few more, then we can tie them together into a raft.   huh.  hmm...  this rock looked familiar.  ohaha.   the unusual rocks were almost identical.   could it be.   george needed to get up high, so he could see far.   ah...  those trees could only mean one thing.     footprints meant feet.  feet meant people, because you don't see a lot of feet on their own.     do we have enough logs.  i don't know how many more i can drag.  we need more.   oh. thanks, george.  george.   look who found me.  look who found me.   oh, hundley.  i thought you were lost.  um, you wouldn't happen to have my boat with you, would you.   uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.  next stop, home sweet home.   hold it.   my yellow hat.  george: oh.  boy: george is a monkey.  he was with hundley in an unusual island habitat.  hmm...  girl: a habitat is a place where animals can survive and live.  today, we're at willow pond.  it's a skipper bug.  it's a water bug, and it's skipping around in the pond.  it's sort of like a speed boat, but much smaller.  bugs help other creatures by being snacks.  some birds eat the water bugs if they're fast enough.  some animals need plants.  it looks a lot like a baby snail.  the leaves are giving it a nice place to stay until it grows.  look.  yeah.  it's just like a black hump over there.  it's under...  it's probably a painted turtle.  painted turtle.  i think this is a good habitat, because there's a lot of grass, so it can probably hide.  that's a, um, grackle.  it has a lot of room to fly and a lot of food.  and a lot of trees to perch and...  we found newt eggs.  a newt lives most of the time on land, but lays its eggs in the water.  a pond is a good place to lay eggs.  a lot of frogs live here.  the pond has food, water definitely.  shelter for the frog.  a pond is a good habitat for them.  narrator: steve and betsy had never seen the country.  so the man with the yellow hat invited them for the weekend.   amazing.  this reallyis the country.  big skies, green pastures...   ah, ooh, wild animals.  sheep and cows aren't wild, steve.  they're domesticated, like charkie.  charkie's pretty wild.  i think i'd rather chase a cow around the city.   moo.  steve: wow. that's the shortest apartment building i ever saw.  betsy: it's a house, steve.     charkie, whoa.    you could've left the books at he.  there's so much to see,  you won't have time for reading.  whoa, charkie.  hmm...  that's a rainbow.  and see the gold at the end.  and the leprechaun.  oh. uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.  rainbows are always the same colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet.  huh.  i can make a rainbow.  want to see.  uhhuh.  uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.  i make my rainbow without the sun or the rain.  the flashlight is like a sunbeam.  the water in the fish bowl is like a giant raindrop.  ooh.  the light shines through the water, and behold.  a rainbow.    betsy's rainbowas nice.  but george wondered if he'd ever see one that spanned the whole sky.  hey, so what wild animals can i get pictures of next.  well, we've got skunks, squirrels, a moose or two...  a moose.  now, there's something you don't see every day on n avenue.  : yeah.  all done.  there's your lunch.  you're ready to go see the country.   i'm going to town to buy food for dinner.   it's only supposed to drizzle, but if it rains a lot, head home, okay.  george knows the way.     betsy, wait.  i'm not leaving without a moose picture.  holler if you see moose.   uhoh.   rain.  do we have to go back already.  mooseless.  no, it's gonna stop.  look, the sun's already through the clouds.   oh...  woohoo.  amazing.  that's the biggest rainbow i ever saw in person.   i can't get a picture with all those trees in my way.    aha.  george didn't see any gold at the end of the real rainbow from here, so he'd just have to go there.   charkie, no.  george, where are you going.  steve, come on.  george and charkie ran off.  hey. what.  where.   betsy, i'm older.  you have to wait for me.   charkie. george.    hey, george, how come you ran off.   you want to find the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.  uhhuh. uhhuh. uhhuh.  uhhuh. uhhuh.  but that's just a fairy tale.  whoa.   aha.  i guess it couldn't hurt to look.  i better mark our trail so steve can find us.   charkie.  george. wait up.  charkie.  betsy.  george.  help.  i mean... help is on the way.  narrator: george knew he was close to the pot of gold now...   ...because he saw a leprechaun.  ooh.  aha.    narrator: usually, george would be happy to meet a frog...   ...but it s no leprechaun.   that's not another rainbow.  it the rainbow's reflection in the water.  huh.  : oh...  and we can't chase the rainbow anymore.  unless we can we cross the river.    charkie, no.  charkie.      uhoh.  oh. i can't leave trail markers for steve on the water.   hmm.  the rocks in the country look almost like cookies.   thisisa cookie.   dog and monkey prints.  and sister prints.  betsy.   a forreal moose.    uhoh.  nice moosie.  help.  back away from the moose, slowly, and don't look him in the eyes.  can we run away now.  no. that might make him charge us.  this is the proper way to flee a moose. )
