with the yellow hat noticed that professor wiseman's light was still on.  hmm.  don't tell me you're still working, professor.  of course.  it's only 9:00.  what's this.  a foot race.  mmhmm.  we're trying to raise money for an expedition to the lost city of oman.  oh.  great cause.  i'll sign up for that.  hey, you want to help me train, george.   great.  what about you, professor.  are you going to run.  me.  : oh, i can't run.  i've got way too much work.  poor professor wiseman.  she doesn't know what she's missing.  uhhuh.  the next day, george couldn't wait to start training.  hey.   wait up.  wiseman: stop. i need help.  this was strange.  the professor who said she couldn't run was running.   terrible. absolute disaster.  what. did the trex collapse.  oh, worse.  anonymous donorsthey won't contribute to the expedition unlessirun the race.  but that's great.  races are a lot of fun.  can you help me train.  i don't know a thing about running.  no problem.  let's meet in the park at lunchtime tomorrow.  byebye.  terrific.  uh, i can't wait.   no, charkie, look out.  oh. aw. whoa.   oh.  oh, boy.  what..  he sprained his ankle.  how can i train for the race without him.  oh.  hey...  you want to be my personal trainer.  uhhuh, uhhuh.  okay.  well, let's get running.  all right.   hey, wait for me.  george thought that to be a trainer, all he had to do was run and professor wiseman would follow.  simple.    george, wait up.  oh.   hmm, maybe not so simple.   oh, i'm so thirsty.  do you have any water.  uhuh.  hey, aha.  here.   uhoh.  okay, that's it.  i'm done.  aw.  sorry, george.  i'm too tired to run anymore.  we can try again tomorrow.  george's first day as a trainer had not gone well.   hi, george.  professor wiseman called.  she said you tried to help her train for the race.  oh...  well, don't give up.  i think it's a great idea.  and i found something that might help.  it's an old training video i used to watch called run for your life.  youyeah, you.  are you ready to run like you mean it.  uhhuh, uhhuh.  you might want to take notes.  oh.  tip #1: before you hit the road, you've got to get graceful.  you've got tostretch those muscles.   when george met professor wiseman in the park the next day, he wanted to be ready.   mm, stretching does feel good.  okay, what's next, george.  ooh.  ah, uhhuh.  time to run.  uhhuh, uhhuh.  but not too fast, right.   all right, then, let's go.  ooh, i'm getting thirsty.  uhhuh.   ah.  ah, thanks.  much better.  so far, professor wiseman's training was going great.  and then...  not so great.  hey.   i don't think running is for me, george.  i find it... well, boring.  huh.  i'd much rather be carbondating a stromatolite.  oh, oh...  the training coach didn't say anything about boring.  the problem is i don't have time to be bored.  i should get back to the museum.  thanks for trying, george.  huh. huh.  george couldn't understand why she didn't like to run.  running can be so much fun.  aha.  make running fun.  it just might work.    you want to show me something, george.  uhhuh.  okay. let's go.  oh.  is this a ferris wheel.  uhhuh.  okay.  i've never been on one of these before.   what an amazing view.  hey, look.  there's the museum.  george: ooh.  i can see my window.  it looks so small from here.   the professor had had so much fun on the ferris wheel that george took her to all his favorite places.      the day the professor outran him, george knew she was ready for the race.  oh, i never knew running would make me feel this good.  i have so much energy now.  thank you, george, for the ferris wheel, for the balloons, for teaching me that running is fun.   good evening, professor.  oh, hi, everyone.  i'm running in that race tomorrow.  will you be there.  ha. we wouldn't miss it for the world.   on race day, george couldn't believe how many people showed up.  okay, i'm ready.  oh, no. i forgot my water.    thanks.  so, you really think i can do this.  uhhuh.  go, professor wiseman.  go, professor wiseman.  sisboombah.  sisboombah.  man: runners, take your marks.   the race was on.  man: go, go, go.  faster. push it.  yeah, that's it, run.  go.  the professor seemed to be doing everything right.  she ran at a steady pace.  and there she was drinking water.  so far, so good.   george wanted to see the professor cross the finish line, so he made sure to get a good spot.  do you see her.  i don't see her.   she looks tired.  george: uhoh.  oh, no, something's wrong.  maybe she got a charley horse.  huh.  that's a cramp in your leg, george, and they can be very painful.  oh.  whew. hi, there.   i thought it'd be fun if my personal trainer finished the race with me.  huh.     haha.   i did it. i actually ran a race.  uhhuh, uhhuh.  i got a medal for finishing, and the race was a huge success.  we raised enough money for our trip to oman.  ah, that's terrific.  and i found out who those anonymous donors were.  apparently, they thought i needed to work a little less and have fun a littlmore.  that's right because all work and no play...  ...is a crummy way to spend your day.   to thank you for helping me learn that lesson, i want you to have my medal.  oh.  boy: george is a monkey.  girl: he showed professor wiseman how to have fun with exercise.  one, two, three, four....  today, we are exercising.  each kid made a part of our exercise course.  go.  boy 1: exercise is important because it gets your heart going and that sends blood to your body, so it can keep you moving.  go.  girl: it helps your body and mind to get active, and it makes you feel very good.  i know that my heart is beating fast.  so you get a good exercise.  boy 1: soccer or any running sport, it's fun, but you're also exercising.  boy 3: stuff you do every day is kind of like exercising.  boy 2: walking is an everyday thing.  you could walk to the park.  you could walk to school.  going upstairs is exercise.  boy 2: it's an everyday thing, but it gives you exercise, too.  it gets you stronger.  so, for the future, you'll be in the habit of exercising.  kids :  oh, we are the county sprouts    and today we're going out    'cause we're the county sprouts.   whoo.  yeah.   george was feeling pretty proud.  he had been made an honorary county sprout, and today was his first sprout outing.  exciting stuff, huh, george.  uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.  it's my first outing, too, as the new sproutmaster.  and let me compliment my assistant sproutmaster bill.  kids: yeah.  ooh, yeah, reporting for duty, sproutmaster, sir.  oh.  i lost the map.  look, we're here.  all: whoa.  woman : welcome to the incredible edible arboretum, a cornucopia of exotic comestibles.  blueberries.  i'll race ya.  blueberries are my favorite bushbased fruit.  come on, george.  all: mm. mm.  it looks like you all forgot the county sprout rules.  huh.  uh, rule #1: "never eat any plant that you're not 100% certain is safe." and that means...  ...consulting theedible plants guidebook.  um, no, it means getting an okay from an adult.  right.  rule #2: "plants are living things.  you can kill or hurt them if you're too rough." so don't pull on them and don't break any branches.   come on.   now let me explain what we will do during our vegetation exploration.   uh, mr. sproutmaster.  we're going to pass through orchards and nut groves.  i wouldn't go that way if i were you.  after that, we'll meet the head gardener, dr. greenbean.    whoa.  according to my new global positioning system, the apple orchard is that way.  um, why don't we check the map.  where is the map.  it flew out the window, sir.  but this is even better.  well, then as assistant sproutmaster, you can be our navigator.  lead the way.  cool.   oh, we are the county sprouts    and today we're going out.    if there was one thing george did not want to do, it was break any more branches.   awesome.  thanks, george.  i think we'll get to the blackberries faster if we go this way.  i don't know, bill.  that trail looks overgrown.  a gps is never wrong.  it says so in the brochure.  oh.   follow me, sprouts.    why is the screen flickering.   either the earth is off its axis, or i forgot to charge the batteries.  okay.  george, can you climb that tree and see where we are.  uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.   and bill... bill.  bill, where are you going.  don't worry.  i've got my handy backup compass.  this way, folks.  bill, a sprout never leaves the trail.  thatthat's rule #3. bill.   oh, excitement's really growing    'cause we don't know where we're going.   in this direction, green.  in this direction, a path.    huh.  george couldn't believe what he was seeing.  someone was trying to break that branch.  somebody was not being a sprout.   oh, no.  this man was wrecking a tree.   whoa.  hey. are you a monkey.  uhhuh. uhhuh.  cool.   i always wanted a monkey, but my mother said no.  george had to do something and fast.  this tree was in trouble.    hey.  return the headgear, monkey.   seriously.  i need that.  i might get sunburn.  no fair.  i don't have monkey legs, you know.   stop.   come on. come on.      you know, this is fun and all, but i have to get back to work.  aah.  oh. oh...   george didn't mean for the hat to get wet...  or the man.  but george couldn't wait around.  he had to check on that tree.   oh, we are the county sprouts    and we're wandering all about    'cause we're lost in the forest    and no one is looking for us    which mean we're...   vinny and vicki.  please. we're not lost.  we're just misplaced.  according to my compass, this way is north. this way is south. and east and west are here and here.  uh, but without a map, that doesn't really help us.  but you know what.  we can determine our precise location using an analog watch.  we just need to know the true local time.  do you know the true local time.  i have another idea.  let's ask george to climb a tree and...  oh, no. i left george in the tree.  george.  where are you.  george.  george wished he could think of a way to get the branches back on the tree.  he needed something sticky, really sticky.  like...  ah...  mud.    ah.   another great monkey invention.    the treewrecking man was coming back.  and he'd probably want to keep on wrecking.  haha.   you are one crazy monkey.  i haven't run like that since...  hey. where's my lopper.   that thing i was cutting branches with.   george.  can you hear me.  george.   george.  oh, thank goodness i found you.  oh, i'm sorry i left you in that tree.   oh.  dr. greenbean.  nice to see you.  huh.  sorry we're late.  we've had a rough day.  tell me about it.  first this monkey ran off with my hat, and now my tree lopper has vanished.  uhoh.   hey.  what's going on.  who put mud on this.  uh... george.   ah.  so, dr. greenbean was cutting some branches and you thought he was hurting the tree.  uhhuh.  oh, you should have asked.  oh, wait.   you're a monkey.  well, anyway, this is called pruning.  you make a careful cut, and it doesn't hurt the tree at all.   he's right, george.  i've pruned many a tree in my day.  you see, george, too many branches are bad news.  they block the sun, and then the fruit can't grow.  oh.  but, hey, i'm proud of you, george.  you behaved just like an honorary sprout.  in fact, i would say your effort on behalf of trees qualifies you for full sprout status.  huh.  hooray.  go, george.  nice work for a city kid.   okay, sprouts, let's go get some lunch, and dr. greenbean can tell us everything he knows about trees.  uh, bill, are you coming.  in a minute.  i'm still trying to figure out where we are.  oh.  huh.  hey, i got it.  uh... mr. sproutmaster.  according to this, you're going the exact wrong...  wait.  you're going the right way.  never mind.  proceed.  girl: george i girl: george is a monkey.  boy: he learned that it's important to take good care of trees.  we are at the arnold arboretum.  nancy is showing us different kinds of trees.  can you tell us what it's called when a tree keeps its leaves through the winter.  it's evergreen.  evergreenthat's right.  nancy: the trees that lose their leaves in the winter are called "deciduous" trees.  girl: the evergreen needles are small and pointy.  the deciduous leaves are flat and wide.  she asked us to find a particular tree.  nancy: this tree is called sassafras.  it smells kind of like fruit.  the branches smell good.  it smelled like salsa.  smells like hot pepper.  and the root smelled really good.  it smells like root beer.  it smells like candy.  i think it's important to know about trees.   a new baby is coming to our family    we can't wait to meet the baby   announcer: watch an allnew week of "daniel tiger'sneighborhood," starting
