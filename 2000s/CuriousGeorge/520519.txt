take you anywhere in the city.  even to ancient egypt...  thanks to the museum.  this looks great.  it looks exactly like the real thing.  see.  george: ah...  uhhuh.   oh, that.  it's a hawk.  it warns people that this is the pharaoh's barge.  ah.  ah... my history teacher's gonna love it.  at least i hope she'll love it.  i really need an a.   there's only one thing left to do.  huh.  see if it floats.   aw...  huh.  i guess i could try it out in the bathtub.  but... in ancient egypt, boats had to stand up to storms and... and rough seas and... and crocodiles.   the bathtub probably didn't have any crocodiles.  hey.   but endless park did.  statues of crocodiles, that is.  steve: good thinking, george.  this is the perfect place to try out my boat.  uhhuh.  huh.    relax.  i'm in fifth gradei'm prepared.  aw.  aah.  oh, man, this is great.  i can see if my boat holds up in bad weather.  yeah.   steve: she takes a dripping and keeps on, uh... floatin'.  yeah.  my history teacher's gonna be so impressed.  i mean, i actually didmy homework.  i need an a to pass the class.   george was sure steve would get an a.  his homework floated really well.  unfortunately...  it was floating away.   come back, boat.  maybe george could make the boat move towardshim.   good thinking.  we can make another wave with this rock, and the splash'll send it back to shore.   i killed my homework.    it's unsinkable.  i should get an aplus.  uhhuh.   quick. catch it.   oh....  whoa.  aw, look at it take those rapids.  i am a master barge builder.   oh, yeahthe boat.  i'll probably get an aplusplus if i can ever catch it.  ah.   whoa. whoa.    great, georgewe'll cut it off at the pass.   but... we need something to catch it with.  let's use this.   help me out, will ya.  huh.  ah. right.  uhoh.   aw....   george. it's getting away.   : oh, no.  aah....  steve: excuse me. pardon me.  coming through.  history homework on the loose.   i got it.   steve's boat was a goner.   or it would have been, if the drain had been draining.  but it wasn't.   until someone cleaned it.  no....  hang on, kid.  you can't go down there.   uh, you don't understand.  my history homework is in there, and i've just gotta get it back.  i've just gotta.  otherwise, i'll be stuck in class with my kid sister next year.   that's rough.  yeah. you're telling me.  hold on.  what.  huh.  anything that goes down a drain goes to the wastewater treatment plant.  maybe your homework is there.  then we're going there, too.  george: yeah.  man: hold on.  it's that way.  steve: thanks.  aw, this is great.  we go to the plant, we get my boat, bing, bang, boom, easy a.  george: uhhuh, uhhuh.   aw...  this is not going to be easy.   so let me get this straightyour homework just went down the drain.  yes, sir.  and i need to get it back.  oil, grit or solid.   wait.  your boat's not here.  it's raining.  but the sanitation worker said everything that goes down the drain goes here.  yeah.  uhhuh, uhhuh.  it doesexcept during heavy rains.  the system can't handle all the storm water, and it overflows.  oh.  right now, the pipes and tanks are backed up, so anything on its way here isn't going to get here.   there.  it goes down the river to the ocean.   the ocean.  how am i gonna find my history homework in the ocean.  woman: if your history homework is out here, we could find it.  thealbatross is a skimmer boat.  she patrols the harbor for floatables.   like that.  floatables are we call trash in the water that bypass the treatment plant.   wow, there sure is a lot of it.  and it's almost all from people littering on the street.  you see, the trash gets washed out here when it rains.  hey.   steve: aw. that plastic ring has got a bird.   don't worry.  we'll help her out and then release her.  oh.   hey.   my boat.   at least i think that's my boat.  there you are. good as new.  aw, i wish i could say the same for my boat.  my teacher's never gonna believe my homework went down a storm drain and got destroyed.   well...  i think i've used that excuse before.   both: aw.  and then we went to the filtration plant.   but the boat wasn't there because it was raining really hard.  ooh, ooh.  and when that happens, the storm water and wastewater never even makes it to the plant.   it all goes right to the ocean.  trash out there is called "floatables." and this thing called a skimmer vessel goes and tries to clean everything up.  uhhuh.  so, in conclusion, that's why my project is dirty and smelly.  ohand ancient egyptians used them and stuff.  so, when it rains, everything goes into the ocean.   that's awful.  somebody ought to figure out a way to warn people.  yeah. they should paint a model boat with an x through it on the street drains, so some other kid doesn't lose his history homework like i did.  and while they're at it, they should paint, like, birds and fish andand little wavy things for water on the street drains.  and then, like, paint a coffee cup with an x through it, so people know not to litter because it'll end up in the ocean.   that's a very good idea, steve.  it is..  um, i mean, yeah, it is.  uh, does this mean i get extra credit.   perhaps.   tada.   this was a terrific idea for a class project, steve.  uh, thanks.  of course... the bad news is, you won't get to be in history class with betsy next year.   all right.   yeah.  steve's grade was looking better.     aha.  and so was the water, because when it comes to litter, monkeys don't monkey around.  child: george is a monkey.  he and bill followed the boat, and it ended up in the ocean with some trash.  child 2: rebecca is from the charles river watershed association.  this is a model of the area around a river.  child: we put on pretend stuff that can pollute, like dirt,oil, salt and cow poop.  what does the river look like right now.  child: it was pretty clean.  child 3: then we had, like, this huge rainstorm.  rebecca: now i want you to look at the river.   child: it got really, really dirty.  rebecca: yeah. when it rains, anything that's on the ground here will go into the river.  child: we explored all around the river and found lots of litter.  girl: we're cleaning up all the litter around the river so the next time it rains, it doesn't flow into the river and pollute the water.  anyone can do this to help the environment.  narrator: in spring, good gardeners can't wait to get things growing.   need any more help.  uhuh.  okay, i have to go help professor wiseman design a new terrarium.  bye, george.  george had his seed system set.  first, he dug a hole.  then he planted some seeds.  ah.  then he covered the hole.  uhhuh.  compass had a seed system, too.  but he didn't plant seeds.  he ate them.  he thought it was awfully nice of george to put out a pigeon buffet.   aah.      compass thought this restaurant had weird rules.  oh.    maybe they weren't supposed to eat the seeds until george was finished.   huh. hey.    or maybe you weren't supposed to eat while george was around.      huh.     ooh...    oh.   huh. huh.    george wished there were two of him.  and then he remembered.  farmer renkins protected his garden from the birds with a scarecrow.  ah.  so george decided to make a scarecrow, too.      only... it wasn't very scary.       hmm.  maybe the birds were only scared away when something was moving.   that was it.  but how could he get it to move.  he also needed more seeds.  oh.  seeds were easy.  making a scarecrow move was hard.  i heard a guy named quixote opened a new bakery up ahead.  hungry.  uhhuh.   it was the biggest pinwheel george had ever seen.  pretty neat, huh.  uhhuh.  it's a windmill.  ooh.  yep.   it grinds my grain for me.    let me show you how it works.  when the wind blows, it pushes the sails just like wind pushes a sailboat along the water, but since sails are attached to the mill, instead of moving forward, they spin around.  ooh.   some people use windmills to make electricity.  george: oh.  i use mine to make flour and butter.  well, i'll be.  what do you think, george.  ooh.  quixote: that's the butter churner.  oh.  quixote: those stones grind the grain into flour for bread.  bread and butter go together like...  well...  ...bread and butter.  uhhuh.  mmm.  that is pretty amazing.  my windmill.  mm. no. your butter.  i didn't know a windmill could do that.  oh, you can use a windmill to move just about anything.  ah.  yes, this one's a pepper mill.   oh.   that was it.  george could use a windmill to make his scarecrow move...   ...and george's garden could finally grow.   ah. uhhuh.    he was going to need a bigger windmill.  luckily, george knew a perfect place for finding thingsthe recycling room.   hmm...  now, what did mr. quixote say.  if you're building a windmill, you need sails.  a sturdy base.  uhhuh.  something for the sails to spin around and something to make the scarecrow move.    now that he had the windmill parts...  ...he just had to put them together.   huh.   time to take those sails for a spin.   but his windmill stopped short.  so george gave his windmill a leg upfour of them.  aha.    when you're making a windmill...  yah.   ...it's easy to get wrapped up in your work.  ay, ay, ay, ay.  so george gave his sails a trim.   his sailmoved...  but his windmill didn't.  oh.  what was he missing.  quixote: when the wind blows, it pushes the sails.  narrator: and then george realized these were too loose, so he got more sticks and attached the sails with tape.   hmm.  george could push his sails, but the wind couldn't.    mr. quixote's sails were stiff.  ooh.  maybe that gave the wind more to push against.   ah. uhhuh.  so george made his sails stiff.     all his windmill needed now was a scarecrow mover.   at last, his windmill was finished, and it was a good thing, too...  huh.  ...because he was out of tape.  now he just had to wait for the wind.    and get a weight for his windmill.  ah.       george had done it.  he'd made his scarecrow move.    but he did feel bad for compass and his friends.   : whew.      now the pigeons could eat their food while george grew his.  boy: george is a monkey.  girl: george is a monkey.  he figured out how to use wind power to make the scarecrow move.  boy:we are playing with the wind today.  boy 2:if the wind's going fast enough, we can fly our kite.  you need a lot of wind speed to get the kite in the air.  boy 3: it's called an anemometer.  boy 2:it shows you how fast the wind's going.  boy 3:the anemometer was made with four cups, some cardboard and the wooden stick.  boy 2: our anemometer has one red cup so we can count how many times it spins.  done.  in ten seconds, it went four times around.  boy 2:not fast enough to fly the kite.  then the wind picked up a little.  ...eight, nine...  done.  it turned nine times in ten seconds.  boy 2:there is enough wind to get the kite up.  wind is interesting because it's natural energy.  wednesday...  that hohum, stuck in the middle day.  wednesday:  anncr: until now.  wednesday: ah.  anncr: all this month, pbs kids is giving your mid week a shake up.  during
