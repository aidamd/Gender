buildingfor two weeks in the mornings...  while the doormanwent to fire safety class.   ms. klopotznick's coming to get these flowers, hundley, and jerry will be here for her quarterly visit.  i'll be back in a few hours.  and just like thata dog had his own building.   what's this.  someone eatingms. klopotznick's flowers.  it was up to hundleyto lay down the law.      hundley was scaringthe caterpillar away...  very, very slowly.  hundley noticed...  it was longand low to the ground, kind of like him.  but it still shouldn't bein his building.  wait. long, lowand cleaning the lobby.  it was exactly like him.  hundley had a new friendhundley jr.   hmm.  ah, hi.  george wanted to showhundley his new ball.  looked like hundleywanted to play catch.  eeh. ooh.  he wasn't very goodat it, though.   ahh.  hundley wasn't about to leta runny, jumpy, georgeishmonkey near his new friend.  hundley jr. might get squished.  george tried to tell hundleythere was a caterpillarbehind him.    hello.   hundley was relieved.  george hadn't ruined things.   huh.  hundley was giving him flowers.  okay, not for him.for the caterpillar...  to eat.  hundley jr. could livein the lobby forever.  maybe he'd even be a doormanwhen he grew up.  yep, the lobby was a great placefor a baby caterpillar.  hey, hundley. remember me.  i'm jerry. i'm here to get rid of your bugs.     the lobby is a terrible placefor a baby caterpillar.  you might want to go outside while i spray.  oh.  they needed a new placefor hundley jr. to live.  ahh.  hundley liked george's idea.  hundley jr. wasup high and safe, but close enough to seefrom the lobby.  a tree was the perfect placefor him to live.   except...  his neighborswanted to eat him.    outside was out.  hundley wondered where elsehis new friend could live.  hundley's favorite placeto live was his home.  it was warm, soft and safe.  that's it.  hundley jr.could live with him.  ohh.  hey, hundley. is the doorman around.  i need him to sign for this package.   well, i'm running behind today, so... close enough.  have a good day.  hundley had to stay in the lobbyand take care of hundley jr.  but he couldn't do bothat the same time.  and the only one aroundwho could help was...  a monkey.       and just like that,george had his own building.  aha. ohh.   hi.  i forgot this bag of marbles for mr. zoobel.  is the doorman here yet.   first a dog's in charge, then a monkey.  next it'll be an elephant.  sign here, please.  weirdest day ever.  george started deliveringthe bag right away.  he was a great door monkey.  ooh. uhh. ahh.  meanwhile, hundley founda container in the trash...  and made his frienda little housefull of dirt and sticks.  but it wasn't easy.  hundley had been covered intrash exactly once in his life.  today.  things had to begoing better for george.   ohh. ohh.  help. ooh, help. aah. ohh.  hundley jr. was a fast eater.  good thing george gotsome leaves from the tree.  but hundley jr. didn't likethe tree leaves.  he only liked the leavesfrom the flowers.  hundley understood.he only liked one kindof dog food.  he and hundley jr.were exactly alike.  and thensomething strange happened.  hundley jr. dangleddown off a stickand stopped moving.   maybe hundley jr.needed more food.  hundley had to get more leavesfrom the flowers, fast.  when hundley got to the lobby,he couldn't believe his eyes.  nothing was wrong.  aha.  george couldn't believehis eyes either.  hundley was dirty...  and smelled like trash. ew.  hundley needed that food.  but george didn't wanta dirty dog in his clean lobby.    it was hundleyversus monkey hundley.  who would win.  oh, my flowers.  ms. klopotznick,that's who.  aren't they oh, dear, there's milkweed in this bouquet.   i'm allergic to milkweed.   well, at least the lobbysmelled better now.  when hundley got back,hundley jr. was ina tiny sleeping bag.  where did he get that.   hundley would just waituntil his friend woke up.  he was sure it wouldn't be long.  aah. ohh.  okay, there's trashall over the floor, george is in the lobby,and you're watching a stick.  i'm taking your temperature,hundley.  days and days went by, but hundley jr. stayed wrappedup in the hard little bag.  hundley tried to get hundley jr.to come out and play.  nope.  hundley tried to get hundley jr.to come out and sing.  nope.  meanwhile, george kept watchingthe lobby in the mornings...  while the doormanwas at his class.  he did a good job ohh.  most of the time.  two weeks later the doorman was back to workin the morning.  bye, george.  but hundley jr.was still sleeping.  george knew how to wake him up.   it looked like their friendwould sleep forever.  but thenthe sleeping bag opened.  and out came...a butterfly.   huh.  where did hundley jr. go.   it was empty.  but that must meanhey.  the butterflywashundley jr.  no wonder he'd been so sleepy.  it took a lot of workto grow wings.  their little friendhad grown up.  puppies turned into dogs, baby monkeys turned intobigger monkeys...  and caterpillarsturned into butterflies.  hundley was happyhis friend was awake.  aha.  but he was a little sad too.  because hundley jr. didn'twant to live inside anymore.  it was a beautiful day.  a perfect day for flying.  they'd miss their friend, but he was ready to leaveand go see the worldbye.  thanks to them.  hundley was proud.  he'd been a greatcaterpillar daddy.  hey, lobby monkey.  but he'd also learned his jobcould be done by a monkey.  aah.  whoo.    hundley stilldid it better, though.   george and hundley learned...  that some caterpillarsbecome butterflies.  oh, there's a butterfly. the monarch butterfly.   today we are atthe butterfly landingin franklin park zoo.  can i mention something about hundley jr..  that caterpillar will turn itself into a chrysalis.  i call it the circle of life.  egg, caterpillar, chrysalis, butterfly, and then it keeps on going.  the butterfly caterpillar willcreate the chrysalis of itself.   inside the chrysalis,the caterpillar becomesa butterfly.  i can show you some painted ladies.  i think i know why it's called a painted lady.  because it looks like it's painted.  it kind of looks like stained glass.  i see one up there.   ooh, there's a julia butterfly.  it's cool to see butterflies, and butterflies are a beautiful type of animal.  george loved to watch hisfriend, bill, deliver papers.  when it came tonewspaper delivery  bull'seye.  ohh.  bill never missed a target.  and bill never, evermissed a delivery day.  364 days of perfect delivery.  you know what that means, george.  uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.  uhuh.  if i deliver all my papers on time tomorrow, i'll win the golden pouch.   yep. the golden pouch is only given to the best of the best, george.  and i aim to be the bestest.  ohh.  one more perfect day and that bag is mine.   aha.  ooh.  but the next daywas not perfect.  it was... lousy.  george wondered how bill wouldride his bike in all that snow.  not very well, it turned out.   ohh.   can you believe this, george.  biggest day of my career and i can't even get out of my driveway.  last time it snowed this bad, pugnose o'reilly crashed on the lake street curve, sprained his elbow and had to retire.  that's how i got hisroute.  it's no use.  so long, golden pouch.    that's the spirit, george.  did freckles mcfadden, the alltime winningest golden pouch winner, quit during the snowstorm of '79.  uh...  no, he did not.  if freckles didn't quit neither will i.  now push me, city boy.  push me.    thanks, george.  but the trouble withbiking in the snow is, if you manage to get goingwhoa.  whoa.  you often can't stop. aah.  whoa.  oh.   i can't even make my first delivery.  how am i gonna finish my whole route in time.  hey.  if you're not delivering papers, want to pull me around in the snow.  bikes did not work wellin snow.  but that thing did.   i've never used a toboggan before, but so far it's great.  thanks for thinking of it, george.  ahh.  course, once we get to the flats, we'll have to pull it.  but we'll make such good time on the way down, it won't matter.  uhhuh.  good morning. thanks, boys.  hang on. got to steer around this curve.  how do you steer.   hey, you boys all right.  mmhmm. uhhuh.  well, i don't know about toboggans.  i'm not much on snow sports.  i guess i spend too much time playing with my trains.  ooh.  maybe there's something else you could use in here instead.   whoa. george.  aah. yeow.  whoa.  aah.  then george realized...  you can steer by leaning.   whoa, ohh.      george, you're a genius.   why didn't i think to lean.  that's how we can steer the toboggan.  yeah.  oh, it's that golden pouch.  my brain's gone all goofy thinking about it.  ahh.  uhh.  oh, you better keep the blanket. you might need it.    the snow is really piling up. boy, am i glad we've got this toboggan.  hang on, george. here comes the lake street curve.  lean, george. lean harder than you've ever leaned in your life.  ohh.  whoohoo. whoohoo.  only two papers left. golden pouch, here we come. yay.  onlyhuh.  they weren't going anywhere.  they had run out of hill.  okay, george. we've hit the flats.  but we're almost done. time to start pulling.  when i said i could haul it,i didn't know it would be this hard.  we'll never make it around the lake at this rate.  and it's getting colder.   whoa.  you okay.  the wind is crazy.  uhhuh. uhhuh.  and then george realized.   great idea, george.  we turn this blanket into a sail and we can zoom over the flats.   ohh.  we need a mast and a boom.   the two poles you hang sails on.  i know all about sailboats from that model boat competition, remember.  george remembered now.  one pole went up and downand the other wentacross the bottom.  oh.  it was the perfect placefor a mast.  ohh.  if only he hada couple of poles.   ah.  aha.  heh.   from the recycling bins. take anything you want.  ahh. thanks.  sails didn't havebristles or dustpans, so they removed them.  uhhuh.  now, how could he holdthe handles together.  luckily, that was a snap.   ready to hang the sail. uhhuh.  that's another nautical expression.  whoohoo.  once their sail was sailshaped, they needed to attach itto the poles.    ahh.  huh.  attaching it to the mastand boom was a breeze.  ohh.  well... almost.  eh. ahh. hmm.  with their sail in place,they'd soon be moving quickly.  ahh.  but their mast blew past.  so george found a wayto hold it fast.  ready.  ready.    okay. yeah.  what if we let the boom out so the sail catches the wind.  huh.  yay. whoooo. perfect.  hooray.  yay.  here you go, mr. torsten.  whoohoo.  it's 4:45.  only one more delivery, but we'll never make it all the way around the lake to windmill lane by 5:00.  hmm.   ahh.  they didn't have to goaround the lake.  they could go across it.   good idea, george.   whoa. ohh. whoa. ohh. ohh.  huh.  you do the honors.   whoohoo. uhhuh.  not bad for a city kid.   aah.   she's a real beaut.  couldn't have done it without you, partner.  ahh.  so, george, day one of a new golden pouch delivery year starts today.  think we'll win again.  uhhuh.  george was certain...  because when it cameto paper delivery, it was always smooth sailingwith bill.  can't get en the wind made georgeand bill's toboggan go.  we are using wind power too.  we're going to make sailboats.  this is going to be the boat. this is going to be the sail.  i'm ready to test.  the bottle wants to floaton its side, not the way i want it to.  i think i should put some rocks on it.  when you add weight, it makes the bottom more heavy...  so that the bottom stays to the bottom...  and the top stays to the topso it doesn't tip over.  yay.  annalise added two halvesof a bottle on each side...  to keep her boatfrom tipping.  mine's going. it's going far. )
