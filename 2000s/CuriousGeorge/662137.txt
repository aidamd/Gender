  it put him in the mood for grapes.  man: grapes. grapes.  get your big, green, juicy grapes right here.  ooh.   ooh. ah.  it's a new farmer's market, george.  you ready to do some shopping.  uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.  great.  : ooh.  ahh...    hey.   hundley was not enjoying all these people messing up the front of his building.  okay, george, here's the plan.  george. right.  you disappear.  i'll do the shopping and catch up with you later.  man: grapes, get your big, green, juicy grapes right here.   want to sample my grapes.  oh.  sorry, george.  but try some.  they're extra juicy.   man 2: if you like juicy, there's nothing juicier than actual juice.  try the most delicious drink you'll ever drink, courtesy of me, juicy jay.  it's got five fruits and vegetables.  oh.  plus a special secret ingredient.   that was the best drink george ever drank.   here you go.  george, wait'll you see all the stuff i bought.   well, okay, but just one sip.  i'm not very thirsty.  hmm.   ahh. whew.  can i have two more.  you sure can.  oh.   that's some juicer you've got there.  second best invention in the world.  the first is my tasty health drink.     i know these are delicious, but we should save the rest for later, george.  well, okay. i think that's later enough.    mmm.  boy, that was tasty.  uhhuh.  are you thinking what i'm thinking.  huh.   right, let's go.   hey.  where'd everybody go.  everybody packed up and left already.  huh.  but don't worry.  they'll be back next week.  huh.  huh.   a whole week without juice.  what was george going to do.  you know, george, if we had our own juicer,  there's a kitchen supply store right around the corner.  let's go.  yeah.  oh, boy.  i have no idea how to use this.  but when in doubt, read the... instructions.  hmm.  i guess there are no instructions.  oh.  well, don't worry.  between a smart man and a smart monkey we should be able to figure it out.   hello.  what..  i'll be right there.  sorry, george.  professor wiseman needs me at the museum.  they're picking a new shade of yellow for the main hall.  i'll be back as soon as i can.    ooh.  george figured a smart monkey all by himself should be able to work this thing.    now, what did juicy jay say he put in that drink.  it's got five fruits and vegetables, plus a special secret ingredient.  five fruits and vegetables.  all of them seemed to be red.  hmm.  apples are red.  and peppers.  and strawberries.  ooh.  and watermelons.  ahh.  george didn't know what cabbage was, but it was the last red thing in the fridge.  five red things.  oh...  now, all george needed was a special ingredient.    hmm.  a red fish.  why not.     okay.  so maybe raw fish is not a special juice ingredient.  george decided he'd try again, and make a fishfree juice.  he started with one of everything: one apple, one strawberry, one pepper, one piece of watermelon and one whatever this was.     that wasn't it at all.  he had the red ingredients.  hmm...  what could be the problem.    george decided to experiment with different amounts of each ingredient.  he used a big piece of paper to keep track.   hmm.  ahh...    not berry enough.  so george added strawberries.  ugh.  too sweet.  george added more peppers.   it still wasn't right.  and it certainly didn't pass the hundley test.   maybe george needed more of... these things.  close, but george thought more apples might help.  yay.  george's juice was perfect.  well, almost.  it still needed a special secret ingredient.  huh...  where could he find one of those.  ah.  pisghetti: hello, giorgio.  say, can i interest you in today's special.  special.  that's exactly what he was looking for.  it's eggplant piccata, with extra amounts of piccata.  oh...  oh, those are radishes.  try one.  try one.  oh...  oh, but careful.  radishes are a little, eh...speziato.  that means "spicy."  radishes were spicy.  but spicy might be good in a drink.  ooh.   i know.  help yourself, giorgio.   just the radishes.  uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.  byebye.  byebye.  george hoped that one radish would do the trick.  ah.  george had done it.  his juice was just as good as juicy jay's.  better, even.  george.  oh, no.  hi.  oh, have you been making juice.  uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.  mmm. oh, oh, my goodness, this juice is amazing.   yeah.  george thought his juice was so delicious he decided to give it away at the next farmer's market.  get your "george juice." it's made with apples for strong bones, cabbage for vitamin c and a bunch of other healthy stuff.   oh, thanks.  oh.  this is fantastic.  can i get the recipe.  sure.  george started with your juice, but added a few new ingredients.  uhhuh, uhhuh.  a radish..  oh, that is brilliant.  a revolution in juicemaking.  to george and his delicious george juice.  yahoo.  girl: george is a monkey.  girl: george is a monkey.  he used different amounts of ingredients to make his own really good juice.  today, we are making juices out of different fruits and vegetables.  this is a juicer, similar to what curious george was using.  boy: i'm making spinach juice.  girl: oh, yuck.  oh, yuck.  oh, yuck.  girl: patrick is using a simple squeezer.  the juice goes through these holes.  patrick: these juices have vitamins, minerals, and other healthy stuff.  girl: each kid is coming up with their own recipe.  for this recipe, i'm going to use only green and brown juices.  four scoops of lime, one scoop of spinach, four scoops of celery, two scoops of apple.  it tastes sour, and it tastes really bad.   fourscoops of carrot, five scoops of tomato, and two scoops of spinach.  it's really good.   girl: it's healthy, and it's yummy.  narrator: of all the birds george loved to visit at the aviary, the cerulean warbler was his favorite.   which is why today was so important to him.  well director, here's the book.  everything you ever wanted to know about the cerulean warbler in just 1,400 pages.   very impressive.  uhhuh, uhhuh.  i want everyone to know that the warbler is endangered.  there aren't many left.  hopefully, this will do the trick.  oh, a book like this will help get the word out.  how's it selling.  uh, not so well.  we were hoping you could give them to all the bird lovers who come here to the aviary.  uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.  sure. how many.  um, just a...  few...  hundred.  well, it's a very important topic, so i'll see what i can do.  thanks.  man: i have another plan for spreading the bird word, george.  i'm meeting today with lance libro.  he owns a big chain of book stores.  and you know what i'm going to say.  huh.  "mr. libro, the cerulean warbler needs your help.  you must carry my book."  oh, boy.  narrator: later that morning, george was still thinking about the warbler...   ...and the fact that their bathtub was filled with books.  steve: lemonade.  get your free lemonade.  huh.  ah.  say, can i have another.  mmm, gosh, this is wonderful.  the best ever.   hey, george.  you know why they call me the "the lemonade king".  uh... uhuh.   mmmmm. ahh...  free samples.  once people try this stuff, they're hooked.  they can't get enough, and they bring back their friends.  mmm, this is the best ever.  i'll take two, please.  wow. sure.  ah... oh.  that gave george an idea.  if people got free samples of the man's book, maybe they give some to their friends, too.  that'd be a great way to spread the bird word.  ooh. ahh...  what you got there.  ah, the man's warbler book.   with each lemonade you're going to give a free book.  in business, we call that a twoforone.  can't miss.    but not everyone who wanted lemonade wanted a book.  either it didn't fit on a bicycle...   ew.  ...or it was too yellow...  aw.  ...or they didn't know how to read.    another great sales day for the king.  how'd you do.   hmm. looks like you need to reach more people.  you should advertise.  huh.  it means show what you got, so people know you're here.  check out my sign.  hmm. hey.   that's the idea.  you just need to put the sign where a lot of people can see it.  hmm... huh...   now you're talking.  people will see that for miles.  want some help.  yeah.  okay, so we need to paint something that'll really grab people.  a picture with pizzazz.  boring.  boring.  super boring.  mega boring.   bingo.  now for the paint.  sheesh, that billboard is kinda high.  uh, george, how about you paint and i'll supervise from here, okay.   don't forget the picture.    when george got close to the billboard, he could see things he couldn't see from far away, like the fact that the billboard wasn't just one big sheet of paper, but six sheets glued together.  hmm.   that's it.  start from the center.  neatness counts.  i'm here for ya, buddy.  go, go, go...  score.   hey, george.  are you done.  uhhuh.  uh, george...  huh.  did you paint the picture on the billboard the same size as this.  uhhuh, uhhuh.  oh, that explains it.  you painted too small.  i'll show you.  you can't see small stuff from far away.  oh.  so george resolved to paint big.   he'd cover every last inch of that billboard.   ha.  huh.. who.. oh, hi, george.  how'd ya do.  huh.  it looks like you painted only part of the picture.  did you run out of room.  uhhuh.  george wondered how he could get a small picture onto a big billboard.  then he noticed something.  hmm. huh.  hey.  the fold marks on the picture were just like the rectangles on the billboard.  aha.   oh, i get it.  match the rectangles here with the rectangles there.  that'll work. here, i'll make it easier.  six rectangles.  paint one at a time, and you're good to go.  ha.  this time george was sure he'd get it right.  what..  george. come down here, quick.    look.  you're painting the rectangles out of order.    let's put the pictures back in order.  uh, okay, that looks good.  but how do we keep them in order when you're up there.  aha.  george remembered that numbers were a good way to keep track of things.  you're numbering them.   good idea.  to keep everything straight, george numbered the rectangles on the billboard in the same order.  lookin' good, george.   boy, talk about a slow news day.  hey, there's a monkey painting a billboard.  i wish.  there's a monkey painting the billboard. pull over.  are we rolling.  this is a special report...  today... live.  one monkey. one billboard.  one story you'll never forget.  mr. libro, won't you please reconsider.  my book is very important.  yeah. but is it funny.  well, no.  see, that's a problem, 'cause i like funny.  hey, what's everybody staring at.  is that a monkey..  what's he doin'.  oh, no.  i know that billboard.  what.   look at that. a monkey painting a goofy guy with a bird on his...  wait a minute.  you're the guy.  yup. it's me... and my monkey.  brilliant advertising campaign.  if your book is half as brilliant as that billboard, then i'm sold.  i've never seen anything like it.  this book is selling like hotcakes.  well, george deserves the credit for that.   it made me laugh, it made me cry, it made me wanna donate half the proceeds to the warbler foundation.  and there you have itone book, one monkey, one recipe for sales success.  reporting live from lotsa libros.  don't forget, save the warbler.  and try steve's lemonade.  hey.  boy: george is a monkey.  he figured out how to make the picture much bigger.  woman: i wonder how we're going to make this map of south america big enough so that it can go on this wall.  boy: people can make different parts of it.  this is called a grid.  when you see a pattern like this, where's there's lines down and lines across, it's a grid.  we've got our grid of south america.  each of you is going to get one part of south america to make.  this small square is going to become this big square.  she gave us a paper, and it has a little square to tell you which part of the map you're doing.  everybody's going to have a partner and do a part.  boy: we're going to put it all together, and it's going to make a big south america map.   what do you think.  it looks like south america.  yes.   it's the 'pbs kids summer safari' with a bigger than big movie event.
