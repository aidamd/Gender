  well, every day  every day   is so glorious  glorious  george.   and everything  everything   is so wondrous  wondrous   there's more to explorewhen you open the door    and meet friends like this,you just can't miss    i know you're curious  curious   and that's marvelous  marvelous   and that's your reward    you'll never be bored    if you ask yourself,"what is this."   . like curious...    like curious...curious george.   oh...  captioning sponsored byuniversal animation narrator: george loved blueberries.  and the best blueberries anywhere came from renkins' farm.   there you go, george.  man: ea.  where's mrs. renkins today.  oh, she's around the other side of the barn with her balloons.  huh.  narrator: balloons.  this day just kept getting better.   hi.  some balloon, huh.  was bill joking.  no one had any balloons.  you're just in time to help inflate it.  that sounds like fun.  you want to help inflate the balloon, george.   inflate it. where was it.  grab a hold there and lift 'er up.  oh.  it was right hereone great big balloon, as big as a barn.  you can help too, george.  uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.   george had a feeling this was going to take a long time.    or was it.   stand back, george.  great, huh.  hot air's lighter than cool air.  so when the air inside is hot, it lifts the balloon up.  mrs. renkins is letting me go up in the basket with her to photograph some scarlet tanager nests.   huh.  they're birds.  i'm pretty much an expert about 'em.   you can join us if you like, george.  um, will you be going far.  no, just straight up and down.  we'll be tethered to this spot.  huh.  the tether's that rope.  it ties us down so the wind can't blow us away.  oh, well, if you want to go, george...    okay, i'lle right back, boys, and then we'll take off.  hmm...  you're pretty agile for a city kid.  uhoh.  we're not supposed to go up without mrs.  renkins.  there are regulations.   oh. uh...  mrs. renkins, we may have a rules violation here.  oh, my gosh, we got to follow them.  man: oh, boy.  oh, poor george.  i hope he's not too frightened way up there.   whee.  oh.  george could see his house from up here.  no need to panic, george.  there's a proper method for getting a balloon back down on the ground.  i just wish i knew what it was.  mrs. renkins: they're going to go wherever the wind takes them.  lucky there's only a soft breeze today.  i... i... i'm coming, george.   why'd you stop.  'cause this is a truck, not a duck.  oh.  ahoy.  oh, oh...  row, mr. quint.  row like the wind.  but i have a motor.  then you motor like the wind.  i'll row.  as a city kid, i guess you're used to tall buildings, but i've never been this high up in my life.  it sounded like bill wanted to go back home.  hmm...  this sure looked like a steering wheel.  uhhuh, uhhuh.  so george decided to steer them home.   whoa.  oh, no.  it's going higher.  george, that increases the flame.  heating the air makes us go up higher.  george, right now the important thing is stopping this balloon.  maybe those sandbags were the balloon's anchors.  whoa.  whoa, whoa, steady, steady...  well, i'm trying, but i don't want those bags to hurt my boat.  hey, clint, you know you can't park here.  loading zone.  don't drop anything else.  it makes us lighter so we go up.  we need to be heavy to go down.  oh.  officer wint, my monkey is floating away with the boy next door.  climb on.   it's okay.  i'll get us down.  : just stay calm.   okay, they're just ahead.  easy.  let's try again.  got it.  whoa, whoa...  well, good luck then.  oh, whoa...  oh, oh.  i've got you, george.  that's not a safe and approved manner to ride a balloon.  i know, bill, i know.  now don't worry. i'm going to help you...  ow.   this is what happens if you don't follow the rules.  uhhuh.    the wind's getting stronger.  you can tell from that flag down there.  it could be worse.  at least the wind's not blowing us toward the ocean.  huh.  oh, no, the wind changed.  it's blowing towards the sea.  do you know what that means.  uhhuh.   well, yeah, sea gulls.  but also, we're gonna float across the ocean, and i don't know how to stop us.  we'll probably land in some other country where i don't even speak the language and hate the food.  : i want to go home.  i wish i knew how you city kids stay so cool under pressure.   what is it..  what is it..  hey.  pull that cord.  it will open the vent and he can fly out the top.  we're dropping.  the ventit lets hot air out.  so that's how you make a balloon go down.  george, you saved us.  oh, no. the wind's picking up.  we're gonna land in the ocean.  uhoh.  i've got you, george.   i was a little worried, but there's a proper way to worry without panicking.   my camera.  aw, i forgot to take pictures.  man: that's a great one.  george, you took the pictures for me.  : uhuh.  if i didn't and you didn't, how....  george is a monkey, so he can do things that we can't do.  george let air out to bring the balloon down.  we are playing with balloons, too.  ah.  kailash's dad is filling the balloons with helium.  boy: helium is a gas that's lighter than air.  girl: and we don't want our balloons to fly away.  oh, like that balloon floating right now.  boy: now i'm going to put a wood chip.  i'm trying to make this float.  okay, i'm going to let it go now.  and the balloon flew away.  boy: the wood chip was too light, so it let the balloon go high up in the sky.  girl: i added weight to the balloon.  boy: i think it's going to go flying.  it just dropped to the ground.  what would happen if we tied this to a balloon.  i think it would stay on the ground and go pffft, bong.  it's the same thing as this except it's smaller.  it did it.  girl: and then it started flying away.  we did it. we made it float.  narrator: nothing makes dusk special like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich...  and a lightning bug chase.  and nothing slams the brakes on fun like some strange cat eating your sandwich.  this was one weird cat, but it needed to know whose food that was.   huh.   george didn't know what just happened, but he knew it stunk.  whoa... whoa...  did you meet a skunk.  if it's about the size of a cat with a bigger tail, that smell, and nocturnal...  nocturnal...  oh, sorry, that means it comes out at night.  if it's all those things, that's a skunk.  you won't smell bad forever.  tomato juice gets the smell out.  to prevent getting smelledup again, george created an antiskunk tool.  this time he'd scare that skunk so it'd stay far away from him.   hmm.     this must've frightened it.  skunks only spray that smell when they're scared, and loud noises scare them.  if you see it again, george, run inside until it passes, okay.  uhhuh.  the next night, george brought tools to help him spot the skunk.  hi, george.  i'm closing this hole because a skunk's been stayin' under the house.   don't worry. it's not in there now.    ahh. ooh. ahh.   you shouldn't do that.  skunks are scared of bright light, you know.  oh.  take a bath in tomato juice.   oh.  well, good thing we're going back to the city tomorrow.  we're out of tomato juice.  oh.  at the end of the night, the skunk was tired, but it found its old sleeping place sealed up.  this looked like a dark, cozy, excellent place to sleep all day.   hmm. now, where did i leave that basket.   shh.  we don't want to wake the neighbors.  hello.  welcome home.  have a relaxing weekend in the country.  uhuh.  he got skunked.  three times.  say, tomato juice gets the smell out.  oh.  say, george, would you bring that up to the apartment while we get the rest of the bags out of the car.  okay.  ah. you can relax now, george.  there are no skunks in the city.    george almost screamed.  what if it woke up.  how could he keep it calm.  aha.  soothing music.    shh.  george rushed to show it to the man with the yellow hat.  then...  uhoh.  he realized he forgot something.   oh.    george, what's wrong.   oh.  someone left that in the elevator.    george, did we bring the skunk home in the basket.  uhhuh.  we have to catch it without scaring it, or...  you know.  oh. we can't let that happen.  split up. catch that skunk.  the skunk was pretty confused to wake up in a strange new place, and it really wanted breakfast.  stop. come back. you're caught.  oh, boy.  stop.  i'm organizing one elevator trip for all the floors to cut down chances of scaring the skunk.  skunk..  shh. don't do that.  right. sorry.  aha.   oh.      uhhuh. uhhuh.  when that skunk finished eating, it would have no choice of where to go.  the coast is skunkclear.  okay. going down.  wait for me.   zoobel, don't frighten it.  oh. this is jeffrey.  he's a domesticated skunk. he's odorless.  oh. so that's the skunk that george saw.  wait till george finds out we were all worried about nothing.  george's plan was working.  in another second, that skunk would be captured by monkey ingenuity.   george, you didn't see a wild skunk.  uh... hmm...  oh, yes, you did.  don't anyone move.  it's... i mean, she'shappy.  as long as nothing scares her, we're okay.  deejay: that ends our program of mellow jazz.  and now, highlights from the1812 overture.  oh, no.    huh.   girl: george is a monkey, so he can do things you can't dogirl: george is a monkey, so he can do things you can't do.  girl 2: he learned a lot about skunks.  girl: we are observing an animal, too.  curious george learned a lot about skunks, and we learned about squirrels.  look over there.   girl: fabie and ej were telling us how to look for squirrels.  what is it doing right now.  boy: well, it's kind of, like, jumpg.  they have a little hole.  if they don't have a nest, they'll get really, really cold.  now it jumped.  and, oh, oh, my gosh, he's walking upside down.   why do you think the squirrel has to live in a tree.  what might the squirrel be trying to do.  protect hisself.  a dog came and it scared the squirrel.  woman: why do you guys think the squirrels ran away when the dog came.  boy: they thought that maybe he was going to eat them.  girl: he's eating an acorn.  we saw them digging, 'cause he buries it in the winter so he can find it.  i think they eat stuff that they find on the ground, too.  i think it looks like some bread.   there's another squirrel trying to get his bread.  he's chasing him away.  it's good to watch animals so you can be a good learner about animals.   maybe he had too much sugar.  it looks...  he just, like, hopped.  it looks like he's dancing.   for more fun withcurious george and his friends, visit your local library and read
