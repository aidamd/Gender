 hi. it's me hooper.  can you guess where i am today.      here's a clue to where i am.  it's a place where there's lots of water, but it's not a swimming pool.  let's see. here's a good hint.  if you like cars, you can see plenty of them right here, and just because i don't have a car doesn't mean i can't honk.   let's get back to the guessing game.  " you don't mih my car while you wash your truck, do you.  uh, uhuh.  great clue.  it's the place where there are dirty cars that get clean.  so i'm at a place where there's lots of water, where there are cars, and dirty cars that get clean.  so did you guess where i am.  you guessed it. i'm at a car wash.  i wonder if they want to borrow my soap.  hee hee.   this program was made possible by:

station...  ooh.  ...and from:  you never do know what's around the bend    a big adventure or a brandnew friend    when you're curious like curious george   swing    well, everything  everything    is so glorious  george.   and everything  everything    is so wonderous  wonderous    there's more to explore    when you open your door    and meet friends like this you just can't miss    whoa    get curious  curious    and that's marvelous  marvelous    and that's your reward    you'll never be bored    if you ask yourself, what is this.    like curious like curious    curious george   oh.  george, professor wiseman andthe man with the yellow hat...  had a latenight mission.  there was trouble atprofessors al einsteinand tony pizza's space center, and they hopedthey could help.  the space rover needs to roam mars, taking pictures and gathering rock samples.  see there.   but the controls stick.  it works at first, but we have trouble whenever it reaches theuhsleeping monkey.   howi didn't notice him go. how can we communicate with him.  there's only one way, and it's through that door.    george.   george.  hello.  ththe mars yard is supposed to be exactly like mars.  there are no monkeys sleeping on mars.  oh.george knew the man was right...  because he'd been learningall about mars.  he'd learned things,like mars is called"the red planet"ah.  because its soilcontains red iron.  sorry.  george was so excited about seeing the mars rover launch, he couldn't sleep at all last night.  i'm afraid there's not going to be a launch...  if we don't solve this problem.   it's stuck again. butbut why.  mmm.  are you chewing gum.  oh. how impolite of me.  yeanybody want some.  spinach and broccoli flavor. ooh. yum.  ooh. hmm.  now, you know there's no gum chewing...  in mission control, einstein.  sorry, pizza.  hmm.   i go through this every day...  since he discovered that new flavor.  hmph.  gum's allowed in here.   we must figure out...  what is causing the rover's controls to stick...  or cancel the launch.  well, since mars is very different than earth, is it possible the controls wouldn't stick there.  ah. ah.   you're wondering about martian gravity.  yeah. uhhuh. uhhuh.  mars has lower gravity than earth does.  you'd be three times stronger there.  ooh. yeah.   ah.  d'oh.  ah.   hmm. if the pull of earth's gravity...  is causing the sticking, it might not stick in mars's low gravity.  that's true.    but what if itdoes still stick.  george wanted to help,but he was tired.  when the rover sticks, we can get it going again by giving it a good push.   if only we could send someone to mars to push it.  nothing puts a monkeyto sleep...  like a lot of grownupstalking.   wake up, george.  oh.  iit's time to go.  ah.  george had sleptthrough his whole visit.  oh. gee.  you don't wanna go.  uhuh. uhuh. uhuh.  if he doesn't want to go to mars, we can't make him.  huh.  it's time to go... to mars, but if you don't wanna go uhhuh.   aha.  hmm. ready to be the first monkey on mars.   it's an important mission, george.  if the rover sticks, your job is to give it a good push.  uhhuh.  ha.   yep. we're going to mars together.    three, two, one.  lift off.   we're going to mars.   whoohoo.  normally, it takes eight and a half months to reach mars from earth.  but pizza thinkshe's found a shortcut.  yep. according to my calculations, you take a sharp left at the moon.  ah.   ooh. wow.  nice shortcut. uhhuh.  aha.  ah.   mars looked just likethe pictures in george's book, except nowit was right outsidethe window.  uhhuh.  george, get down. the rover is going to deploy.  huh.  george didn't knowwhat "deploy" meant.   ohho. oh.   and then he found out.  ah.  the rover drove away with george.  no problem. just use the remote control to bring it back.  ii can't find it.  oops. ii think i left it sitting on the rover. my mistake.   george was onan outofcontrol mars rover.  he had to stop it.   whoa.  that sure looked likea remote control.   ah.   ah.  itwasthe remote control.   ah.   now george was in full control, except for being lost on mars.  maybe he could find his wayusing the book.  oh.  there werethe two moons of mars.   that wouldn't help himfind his way back to the ship, but it sure was cool.   ooh.  he reachedthe valles marineris.  it looked like the grand canyon,but much bigger thanany canyon on earth.   he also foundthe olympus mons, the highest volcanoin the solar system.  ooh.  it had a pretty nice view too.   he'd found the rocket.  aha.  now all he had to dowas drive there.   yikes.  oh.   the rover was stuck.  he had to give it a good pushto get it going again.  that was his mission.   shee.  ooh. huh.  aw.  einstein's broccolispinach gumwas gumming up the works.  he wanted to get to the shipand tell the manwith the yellow hat, except the roverwouldn't go.   huh.  ah.  luckily he remembered he wasthree times as strongin mars's low gravity.    d'oh.  george, are you okay.  uhhuh.  you were sleeping so peacefully.  did that sound wake you up.  i blew a bubble, and it popped.  oh.  then george realizedwhyhe was dreaming about gum.     tada.  ah, gum in the main rover control panel.  did you stick gum in there every time i told you to stop chewing.  see, ii thought that one was the trash.   oops.  george, how did you figure that out.   ah.   ha. all clean.   it works. we're ready to launch.  seven seconds and counting.  three, two, one.  lift off.  ooh. ah.  george, you saved the einsteinpizza space program.  thank you so much.  you know, sometimes i think the world would be better off...  if monkeys ran everything.    george dreamed that he wentgeorge dreamed that he wason a mission to mars.  i'm on a mission tothe international space station.  hi. i'm astronaut karen nyberg.  i'm doing experiments on the international space station...  that orbits high above the earth.  this is where i work and live when i'm on a mission.  i love to look out these windows and look at our beautiful earth.  right now, we're flying over california and the west coast of the united states.  there's no gravity in space, so everything floats.  even my hair.  we do a lot of experiments on space station to learn about things.  like liquids.  for example, we like to observe how liquids flow...  and how bubbles behave differently in space than they do on earth.  after a long day of exploring, i'm tired.  this is where i sleep.  good night to all my fellow explorers.  it was marco's grandmother'sbirthday, and marco was planninga big surprise dinner.  he had an assistantto help out.  uhoh.  unfortunately,his assistant was a monkey.   don't worry, george. it's just the masa.  we have more.  uhhuh.  see. masa.  you know, cornmeal.  that's what i use to make marco's famous tortillas.  see, there's lots ofuhuhoh.  i thought we had more.  ah.  if there was one thinggeorge knew how to do, it was to fix things.   this was the first timehe'd broken food, but he knew wherefood came fromthe store.  masa.  oh, i am so sorry.  i just sold my last bag.  oh.  but i promised my grandmother i'd make tortillas for her birthday.  she was so excited.  plus, it's the only thing i know how to make.   hang on.  i think you're in luck.  the deliveryman is here.  hey. it's uncle enrique.  uncle enrique, it's grandma's birthday.  yourabuela'sbirthday. imuy fantstico.  you're going to make your famous tortillas, of course.  of course.  ahh.  onlyhuh. "only".  we're out of masa.  oh, no. no masa, no tortillas.  but it turns out you're in luck.  you have masa on your truck.  do i have masa. come on. do i have masa.  uh, no, actually, i don't.  huh.  but i know where you can get some.   yay. ah.  we'll have your masa inun momento.  you're not going to believe this warehouse.   s, s.  that's where packaged food in the stores comes from.  oh.  trucks like mine get food from warehouses like this and deliver it to grocery stores all over the city.  boys, prepare to be amazed.  wow. wow.   it's one of the biggest warehouses in the city.  it haseverything.  if they don't have masa, nobody does.  don't got it. what.  sorry.  you're telling me that in this whole entire warehouse, there isn't one bag of masa.  not one.  i've had calls all week.  still waiting on a shipment. unlesshuh.  we had a pallet that came down one bag short last week.  i think maybe it fell off up there.   all the way up there.  ah.  if anyone was an experton "up there," it was george.  hey. lucky one of us is a monkey.   ooh. aha.  the warehouse managerwas right.  there was one bagof masa left.  marco's birthday surprisewas saved.    george, you did it.  ah.  wait. george, don't try to climb down with the bag in your hands.  just toss it.  uh.  toss it to me. just toss it down.  i'll catch it. just toss it.  okay.  i'm ready. let 'er rip.  watch out. what.     oh, so sorry.  i was talking to can't see.   no, no.  oh.  that was not good.   i can't believe it.  yourabuela is going to have a lousy tortillaless birthday, and it's all my fault.   sorry to tell you this, george, but a crumpled, old bag makes an awful birthday present.  uhuh, uhuh. ah.   george hadfound a picture of somethingthat looked like a factory.  could that be a clue.  aha.  hey. that must be where they make it.   george, you're right.  and there's even an address for the mill.  we're saved.   after traveling for a while, george had a funny feelinghe'd been here before.  when he sawthe quints's house, george realizedthat hehadbeen here before.  a lot.  hey.  there wastheir country house.  and there was the mill.  here we are.  grains like corn and wheat come into the mill...  and are cleaned and inspected.  then the grains are put in this grinder, where they're ground...  and come out as flour or cornmeal.    nice.  it's then put in this giant sifter...  to remove husks or hulls, which are the parts of the grain we don't eat.  aha.  that issocool.  and then, finally, it's put in bags...  and is ready to be shipped to the warehouse.  ah. wow.  any questions.  yes. could we have one bag of masa, please.  oh, i'm so sorry. we don't have any masa.  this is all flour.  oh. what.  i'm sorry.  since there's been very little rain, the drought delayed the corn harvest.  no corn, no masa.  where does your corn come from.  we get ours from local farmers.  farmer.  george knew a farmer...  who just might havesome corn.  look at my new water tank, george.  it stores rainwater for my crops.  ooh.  yay.  what. what is it.  george pointed the wayto renkins's farm.   this is wond it's true, the drought delayed the harvest, but thanks to my water tank, we h just enough to get through.  i've been harvesting all day.  i'm almost afraid to ask, but you say you've been harvestingall day.  yes.  so my question is, do you have corn now.  yes.  yay. whoopee.  yay.  you must really like corn.  not only did mr. renkinshave fresh corn, but he also had dried corn...  that could be groundinto masa right away.  ha.  come on, boys.  we must see that the corn gets through to marco'sabuela.  the tortilla express is on the way.  all right. whoohoo. aha.   so they took the cornto the mill, where it was ground into masaand put in bags.  come on, boys.    then they took the bagsto the warehouse, where they were packagedfor the stores.   huh. ah.  look at that.  and to the store, where they filled the shelvesfor customers.  here you go.  bye.gracias.  and finally, to marco's house.   george was surprised.  he always knew thatmr. renkins grew corn, but he didn't realizethat the food in the store...  and in people's homes...  came from farmerslike his friend mr. renkins.  ah.   she's here.  until that day, george hadn't really thoughtabout how important farmers wereto so many people.   surprise.  iay, qu bueno. delicioso, mi amor.   marco's grandmotherloved marco's special tortillas.  mmm. mmm.  this is amazing. what a tortilla.  but one person loved themmost of all.  i could eat a whole stack. are there more.    nice.  ah.  mmm, mmm, mmm.   mmm.  george and marco made tortillasfrom corn flour.  george and marco made tortillasfrom corn flour.  we are making muffinsfrom cornmeal.  we're gonna grind our own cornmeal.  this is blue corn.  whoa. this looks weird.  and we put it into a grinder.   it has a handle,and that handle's attachedto this piece of metal, and that piece of metalcarries the corn...  to these two disks that rub against each other.  when it reaches the disks, it goesthey will grind the corn,and then turn it into cornmeal.  i think we have big bitsand then small bits.  so we had to sift out the soft cornmeal.  i like to make my own foodbecause it's healthy.  it tastes better.   ooh.  they're all yummy and good.  it's awesome,and it's really creative,and we love it.  summersafari august.  george:
