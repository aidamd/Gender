huh.  oh, hi.  are you closed.  is there some holiday i forgot about.  ask the chef.  huh.  huh.  man: what happened.   please, please, just taste.  a tiny little taste.  please.     gnocchi approves all of my recipes.  but for the past few days, she likes nothing.  i cannot serve unapproved food to my customers.  gnocchi lives on italian food.  of course not.  she merely gives approval.  one lick: good.  two licks: excellent.  three licks:magnifico.  oh, the threelick recipes always prove to be the customers' favorites.   oh.  huh.  i have lost the ability to cook.     oh, my cooking is worse than cat food.   well, it sure doesn't smell worse.  yuck.  mm.  and it certainly doesn't taste worse.  not that i've ever tasted cat food.   mm, mm, mm.  you are just being nice.  if gnocchi won't eat my food, there's no point in serving today.   flower delivery.  it's a nice selection today.  just put them down, hector. thank you.  okeydokey.    no, no, no.  no chewing on flowers today.   we just started using a florist.  gnocchi thinks the flowers are snacks for her.  you might as well let her eat flowers.  she won't eat my food.   i will talk to chef.  this is what comes of letting a cat make cooking decisions.  george wondered why gnocchi wouldn't eat the chef's cooking, when it was clearly delicious.   maybe tomorrow would be better.  or... maybe not.   i'm guessing this means no ravioli for anybody.  ah, there is no hope.  we will have to close the restaurant.   i'm going to retire and take up ice sculpture.   don't give up.  oh, no, you have to stay with the food.  closing the restaurant would be a disaster.  where would the chef and netti go.   how would george get ravioli.  george needed to find out why gnocchi had stopped eating the chef's food.  she must be doing something different.   george would watch her and see what she was up to.        maybe she wasn't hungry because she was eating somewhere else.   george could smell the delicious sausages.  but gnocchi had no interest.     hmm.  so it wasn't just the chef's food that didn't interest her.  george, if you would like to stay, netti is making a farewell dinner.  my cooking is too terrible to serve.   i read that cats sometimes stop eating if they're bored.  maybe gnocchi needs some new toys.  bored.  bored with my food.  no, no, not with your food.  you know, maybe bored with life.     : have a seat.  you might as well enjoy the last dinner before we close.  may as well not let them go to waste.   if gnocchi's eating cat food, she's not sick.  what could it be.    what will we do without ravioli.   uhoh. i think i'm allergic to something in here.   yeah, i have an allergy.  it's when your body overreacts to something like food, or aa plant or...  flowers.  some types of flowers can make some people sneeze and cough.   well, not you.  some people don't have any allergies and some have a lot.  huh.  i have to move these away from me or i won't be able to breathe at all.   hmm...  that seemed familiar, but george couldn't remember why.  some nice, tangy antipasto for you.  ah.  hmm, kind of bland.  huh.  narrator: george knew the tangy eggplant wasn't bland.  hmm.  oh. it's this stuffedup nose.  without a good sense of smell, everything tastes boring.   here's your dinner.   oh, thanks...      huh.  but for the past few days, she likes nothing.  no, no, no.  no chewing on the flowers today.     aha.   george.  george had the answer.    aha.      of course you can take the flowers home if you like them.  oh. oh. oh. oh.    ah.   hey.  well, that didn't work.  george, what are you doing in here.  what are you...   george, i think he's allergic.  you shouldn't...     oh. ah.  your cat is allergic to certain flowers.  here is a list.  oh.  really.  but she tries to eat them.  don't let her.  here's my bill.  so, george's theory was right.  and a lot cheaper.  pisghetti: okay.   one lick: good.  two licks: excellent.  three licks: magnifico.    this will be our special tonight.  it's gnocchi approved.   if not for george, we would never have known that gnocchi was allergic to those flowers.  giorgio, you have saved the restaurant and my reputation.  i'll give you free pizza.    girl: george is monkey.  he was closely observing gnocchi to see what was wrong with her.  girl 2: today we are in franklin park zoo.  my mom is haley, and she's a veterinarian here.  a veterinarian is someone who takes care of animals.  an animal doctor.  charlotte is the giraffe keeper.  how would you guys like to help me today observe the animals.  yeah.  yeah.  girl 2: we learned how to make observations about giraffes.  haley: as a zoo veterinarian, i really depend on the keepers, 'cause they're the people that see the animal every day.  she knows what their normal behaviors are, how they normally would act.  boy: observation is important, because they want to make sure that the animals are not sick.  girl 2: after we observed the giraffes, we gave reports to charlotte.  girl 3: sox is walking to her mom, and when her mom moved away, she was following her.  beau was wagging his ears.  jana was wagging her tail.  beau is wagging his tail.  girl 3: jana was licking her nose.  : he put his tongue in his nose so he can clean it.  boy: beau was licking a leaf with his tongue.  girl 2: charlotte compared these reports to her own observations from last week.  hayley: so, it sounds like everything was normal today.  charlotte: it did. it looked like things were very normal for the giraffe family.  oh. huh.  narrator: the life of a monkey isn't all fun and games.  sometimes you have to deal with serious issues.  ooh.  like making a paper monkey chain.    huh. aah.  hi.  boy, i'm glad to be home.  professor wiseman asked me to bring some rare stamps to mr. stamp.  ooh.  one, two, three, four, five.  all there.  phew. they're so rare, i was nervous i might lose one.   tada.  wow, george, i can't believe you...   ...did all that while i was gone.  aha.   you know, i think you broke the world speed record for making a gigantic mess.  george didn't see a gigantic mess.  just a bunch of little messes that looked big together.   george, you have to learn to clean up after yourself, and there is no time like the present.  i think you're old enough to use the vacuum to suck up dirt and crumbs and paper.  ooh. yeah.   the vacuum cleaner could make stuff disappear.  george couldn't believe it.   all the mess is stored in this bag.  when the bag is filled, you empty it into a garbage can and start again.  oh.  okay, the vacuum cleaner couldn't make stuff disappear, but it was still pretty awe inspiring.   okay, you give it a try.   oh. oh.   hang on. it's adjustable.  now try it.   oh, hey.    okay, stop, george.  george.  george.   uhoh.  uh, george, this vacuum cleaner is too big for you.  oh.  if only there was a monkeysized vacuum cleaner.  hey, i have an idea.  i'll be right back.  don't make another mess.  in fact, don't move till i say so.  just freeze.   great.  okay.   not moving is tougher than it sounds, especially for a monkey.  huh.   oh.   phew.  hi.  what do you think.  uhhuh.  huh.   oh. you can unfreeze now.  phew.  ah.  george, here's your very own dirt dragon.  ah.   now you can clean up whenever you see a mess.    huh.  oh.     ooh, ah...  george, i have to make some phone calls.   you can clean anything that needs it, okay.    ooh.  it didn't matter if george spilled sugar anymore.  he could clean it right up.  i have the rare stamps.   call me as soon as...  george, i can't hear.  vacuum the other room.  please.   thanks.    george was running out of things to clean up.  naughty people beware.  i'm here to clean up this city.   yeah.  of course.  there was a whole city out there for george to clean up.     thank you, vacuum monkey.    vacuum monkey, you saved the big game.    you're my hero, vacuum monkey.  mine, too.  who wants a leafy llama.  oh...   tada.   aha.   see you later, george.  hi, mr. stamp.  those rare postage stamps are right here on my...    can i call you back.   huh...  wow, george cleaned the whole place including the rare, valuable stamps.  that means they're in the vacuum until he empties the bag.   charkie couldn't carry all those small pieces of biscuit at once.   ah. huh.  lucky for her, her friend george was here.  charkie hoped he would guard the pieces for her.  ah.  charkie forgot that george didn't speak dog.   it was a big city and he had a lot to clean up.    every day, when the nice lady threw birdseed, compass flew off to tell his friends it was lunchtime.  aha.       george.  anybody seen a monkey carrying a vacuum cleaner.  is he wearing a cape.  i don't know.  could there be more than one monkey with a vacuum in the city.  oh, i've got to find george before he empties that bag.  i wonder how much stuff it can hold.   )
