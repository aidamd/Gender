"kid" is what you call a baby goat.  oh.  oh. look at that.  they chewed right through the latch.  this one's suzie, and this is sammy.  or maybe this is suzie.  ah, i get 'em mixed up.  sammy got named before allie found out they were both "she goats." sammy is short for samantha.  come on, george. they'rereallyfun to cuddle with.  ah.   they're fun, all right.  ooh.  but they will butt youif you don't look out, george.  and they chew on everything.   see what i mean.   hey.    thanks, george.  they'll be good milk goats when they're grown.  but i've got to plow that field now.  with the latch chewed, who knows what kind of trouble they'll get into...  while ulysses and i are working.  oh.  aha.  george had a great idea.   yeah, grandpa. we'll keep 'em out of trouble.   okay, if you think you can handle 'em.  good luck. thanks, grampa.  bye.  suzie, sammy. no.  hey.  ah.   oh, come here.  saoh. come here.  suddenly, george wasn't sure...  they could handle the goatsafter all.     ooh.     get out of my flowers.  we're coming, grandma.  lands sakes. put down that begonia.    you're very cute, but i can't have you eating my flowers.  there had to be a better wayto keep goats out of trouble...  than chasing them aroundall day.  hey.  oh, that's just the old dog pen.  we don't use it anymore.  uhhuh.    yeah.  hey, george.  you want to go swing on the tire swing.  ooh. uhhuh.  george thoughthe'd solved the goat problemonce and for all.  but the goatsthought differently.   uhoh.  oh, no.  where'd they go this time.    oh.  oh.  have fun.   george was going to make surethat this time...  sammy and suziecouldn't escape.  wrong again.  huh. huh.   but how were they getting out.  it was a mystery.   aha.     ooh.  i'm getting awful tired of chasing goats, george.  uhhuh.  but where can we put 'em that they won't get out.  huh.  hey.  ah.   it's the perfect place to keep 'em.   uhoh.  hey. hey.   oh.  stop, suzie.  oh. no.  they're going in your room.  aha.  aren't they just gonna chew on your stuff.   oh.  oh, well.  at least the goats couldn'tescape from his room...  unless they learnedhow to fly.     george.  no. no major damage.  they sort of... ate my easy chair.  well, they say goats have castiron stomachs.  i guess they can eat anything.  ah.  yeah, maybe that'd be best. i'll send them over.  byebye. huh.    uh, you two better take the goats back home.  i think your grandpa might be planning to give them away.   oh, it's too bad grandpa's giving the goats away...  just 'cause they eat stuff.  nobody's perfect.  i mean, look at ulysses.  he's stubborn.  but grandpa's not giving him away.  uhhuh.  allie was right.  ulysses was stubborn, but he was also useful.  sammy and suzie would be usefulonce they could give milk.  if only there were a waythey could be useful now.  hey.  suzie. sammy.  careful, george. poison ivy.  poison ivy.and the goats were eating it..  would they get a rashin their bellies.  well, they say goats have castiron stomachs.  i guess they can eat anything.  aha.  george might have found a wayfor the kids to be useful.    oh, hi, george.  say, where are allie and the goats.   grandpa, look at sammy and suzie.  well, i'll be.  they're clearing my field.  george figured out a way for them to be useful like ulysses.  they can eat poison ivy.  they rip it right out by the roots.  what do you know.  hey. i can plow this field now.  i could plant alfalfa, or bean sprouts.  rutabagas. mmm.   thanks, sammy.  you too, suzie.  hey, renkins. is that goat eatin' your poison ivy.  she sure is. they love it.  they're clearing grandpa's field for him.  i got some poison ivy needs clearin' out too.  can i borrow em. uhhuh.  you bet, mister.  and that's how george andallie's lawn service was born.  best of all, george and allie'slawn mowers didn't need gas.   george and allieput the baby goats to work.  we met some goatsthat give milk.   today we're atmass audubon's drumlin farm...  wildlife sanctuary.   are these wild animals. no, there are not wild animals.  these are domestic goats.  tia is talking to us about goats.  animals on a farmare domesticated.  these animals live here with a farmer to take care of them.  today we learnedhow to milk goats.  cameron, you wanna try first. squeeze those top fingers shut.  and then close the rest of your hand down.  there you go. it worked.  after you get the hang of it, it's actually very simple. there it is. milk.  their milk can be turned into cheese.  not raw goat's milk.it was pasteurized goat's milk.  it was prepared to make cheese.  it's good.  if i was eating goat cheese, and i really liked it, i would want to know.  where does this cheese come from. oh. goats.  if you're a little monkeyin the city...  searching forsomething fun to do, you don't have to lookvery far.  the "n" avenue animal shelter's scavenger hunt is about to begin.  boys, i tell you, team pisghetti is going to do very, very well today.  maybe we won't win, but

uhhuh.  oh, that's nice, georgio.  you're right. it cheers me up too.  why worry about making the best mud pie...  or winning a race.  i got all my good friends, and if my pizza makes you happy, well, then...  what more could i ask.   nothing like a slice of pizza... or two.   or sometimes all eight.  huh.   it's true.  sometimes i eat all my goodness. eight.  eight pieces.  huh.  eight slices that add up to one.  one pizza.  that's the answer. nettie.  i love you.  oh, chef. all right.    ah.   diamonds.  a hundred, at least.  what time is it. two minutes.  run.  come on. where are they. they have to make it.  we're here.     mmhmm. oh, very good.  a hundred diamonds.  eight things that add up to one thing.  they seemed impossible, but you figured them out, cousin.  well, i had a little help.  it's been a fair game, cousin.  may the best man win.  ladies and gentlemen, we have a score.  as you know, the sponsors of the hunt...  base their donation on the number of points the teams accrue.  this year, i'm proud to say, the shelter will have the biggest donationever...  thanks to the winning team, team pisghetti.   the animals of the "n" avenue shelter thank you.  oh, i'm so

see a triangle on the roof.  they made a bunch of squares out of lines.  cones. the cones. it's the cones.  when we look at it from the side, it becomes a triangle.  notice how i'm taking the pictures that you all took...  and i'm putting them all together...  so that we can print out lots of them.  and we're going to makecollages with them.  and i'm trying to make a flower.  and for the leaf, i
