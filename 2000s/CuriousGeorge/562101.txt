"unique". hmm.  hi, you're a monkey, aren't you.  uhhuh.  okay, it's a deal.   great.  if you clean up this place and put on a unique oneofakind show, i'll save the theater.  mr. glass, i promise we'll knock your socks off.    maybe this is hopeless.  well, let's see it with the lights on.  ooh. aha.   see. it just needs a little tlc: tender lobby care.  you know, it'll take some work, but i bet we can put on a good show.  oohooh, uhhuh, uhhuh.   cleaning up a movie theater was a major production.  thanks.   we've never played for a movie before.    here it is, isle of dinosaurs, one of mr. glass's favorite movies.   hey, great work, you two.  i can't believe this is the same theater. wow.   : ooh.    huh.     george, come on up and i'll show you how the projector works.   man: a movie is made up of many small pictures.  oh.  these gears pull the pictures past the lens.  when we turn on the lamp, it shines light through the film.  tadah. there's the movie.    ooh.   and your toy dinosaur's shadow, too.   i think we're ready for showtime.     places, everyone.  he's here.  welcome to the bijou, mr. glass.   isle of dinosaurs.  seen it a hundred times.  oh, no.  enjoy the show.   george will show you to your seat.  uhhuh.    live music.  nice, huh.   everything's fine.  nothing can go wrong.   man: uhoh.  there we go.   uhoh.  wrong music.  watch the booth for me, please.  you got it.  oh, no.  george, i forgot to start the popcorn machine.   thanks, it's all set to go.  uh, can you change your tune.  less jazz, more mystery.   perfect.    hmm...  this didn't like enough kernels to make popcorn for everyone.  yeah.  now george had some free time to go watch the movie, too.    yikes. the film broke.   uh, just a minor problem, sir.  we'll have it fixed in no time.   quick. fix the film.  mr. glass is watching a blank screen.  hmm...  it's no use. let's start reel number two.  hey.  what's wrong with the movie.    george, tell the band to slow down once i fix the projector speed.  uhhuh.    oh, boy.  ah. here it is.     ah, uhhuh, aha.       hundley was afraid the popcorn would never stop.  it was time to get help stopping this mess.  huh.  hey.     hey.    hundley wasn't going to let a bag of popcorn and a monkey stop him.     uhoh.    uh... mr. glass, i'll...  i'll be in the lobby if you'd like to... talk.  : oh...  well, what did he think.  now, that was unique.  i've never sat through anything like it.  you folks truly knocked my socks off.   yes, you've convinced me that this old bijou has got to stay.  uhhuh.  just one thing.  next time, when the volcano erupts...  hmm.  how about a little less salt on the popcorn.  uhhuh.   boy: george is a monkey.  he used the light from the projector to make his own dinosaur movie.  then, suddenly, two dragons appeared.  curious george learned about a movie projector, but we're using a different kind of projector.  it's called an overhead projector.  there's going to be a light coming through here, and it reflects from this mirror onto the screen.  girl: well, we wrote stories, and we're going to show them to the class.  once upon a time, there was a turtle in his igloo.  suddenly, two monsters came out of the sky.  boy 2: with an overhead projector, you just take a clear piece of plastic and put it over the projector, and you can make it move and stuff.  boy 1: to make it move, you could use your hands and make them look like if they're walking like this.  girl: it's a way to show the audience a big show.  girl 2: on halloween night, samantha and max dressed up as ghosts, so then willis says, "help.  i have ghosts in my house." you could use layers to put a costume.  you could draw that costume and put it on top so it makes it look like it's putting it on.  when there's something that isn't clear, and you put it on the projector, it's only going to make a shadow.  this a sheet of plastic.  you could put it on top of the projector.  it's going to show the color.  girl 2: two dragons built a castle to protect kitty and the bunny.    it was the monthly open house and potluck at the firehouse.   here's our fruit salad.  the elements of our food set are complete.  dessert.   beautiful.   i think my oven rack is off balance.  by 35 degrees, i'd say.  it looks delicious, even or not.  oh, just something i threw together.  baking is so creative.  well, if you'd like another project, there's a bake sale this week at betsy and steve's school.  oh, i'd love to help out.     ah.   george's mouth felt glued shut.  george, are you okay.  i think it's the cake.  mycake.  george.  ah.  it... it seems a bit sticky.  oh, dear.  well, a scientist isn't discouraged by a minor setback.  i'll be extra creative when i cook for the ba the... i... i...  huh.  ah.   what could have gone wrong with the cake.  but chef pisghetti knew about cooking.   oh. sure. let's stop in and say hi.  hi.  hello. how are you.  hi.  george headed for the kitchen to watch the master in action.  hello, georgio.  hi. oh...  the first thing george noticed was all the chef's cooking tools.  some spoons were very deep.  others had holes in them.  some pans were big, some small.  that looked like... a saw.  huh.  maybe some vegetables were tougher than others.    the chef seemed to put in whatever he wanted...  ahhaha.  ...in any amount he wanted.  oh.  all anyone needed to cook were the right tools, so george decided to draw them.  george knew professor wiseman had scientific tools, but did she own the right cooking tools.    george wasn't finding many tools.  ooh.  huh.  hmm...  oh, my.  aah.    we're making carrot muffins, so we'll need carrots.  what do you think.  one carrot per muffin.  uh... uhhuh, uhhuh.   uh... uhhuh.  uhhuh.  we have everything we need to make a nice pan of muffins.  uhhuh.  ready.  uhhuh.  uh....  hah.  oh.  right, but i don't have any aprons.  or hats.  ohh...   hehhehheh.  uhhuh.  ahh.  we're ready to begin.  uhhuh.   now, i know baking soda makes muffins rise.  muffins should be high.  so, we'll need a lot.  ooh.  uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuhhuh.  hmm...  did we put a bit of salt in the sugar, or a bit of sugar in the salt.  i can't tell.  ah. huh.  okay, george.  turn on the oven.  ah.   oh, i so enjoy being creative.  i think our muffins will be a huge success.  uhhuh.  uhoh.  maybe the muffins would taste better than they looked.  oh... dear.  oh, i'm a terrible cook.  i must not have a creative bone in my body.  george was confused.  they had the right tools.  why didn't the muffins turn out.  i have nothing for the bake sale.  oh, i'll have to buy some cookies at pisghetti's.   perhaps chef pisghetti would know what went wrong with the muffins.   i will make you a favorite dish of my grandmothertimballo dell gattopardo.  sicilian pie.  let me just check the recipe, and i will begin.  narrator: recipe.  huh.  what.  okay.  the chef used a recipe.  oh... would you two like to help me prepare.  ah.  uhhuh.  uh, maybe we should just go get some hamburgers.  hey, that's not a bad idea.  prepare.  well, isn't cooking just throwing things together.  getting creative.  ah.   perhaps once you've memorized your recipe, but until then, you must follow it precisely.  you know, like a... formula.  formula.  formulala.  well, it tells you exactly what to put in the dish.  how to measure it.  uh... how long to cook it.  everything.  well, that sounds like...  science.   no, no, no. likeathis.  oh... i see.   tadah.  thanks a million.  oh... huh.  so,that'swhat that thing was for.    ahh...  delicious.  i think this is my best timballo ever...  thanks to my new assistants.  hmm. torta di carota.  oh, that sounds good...  whatever it is.  mmmmuh.  carrot cake.  george and the professor had the same thought at the same time.  bake sale.  hehheh.  the kitchen is yours.  uh...  maybe we should just go pick up doughnuts.  yea, doughnuts.  yeah, that sounds good.   what'd i tell ya.  great cake.  mmm.  that sure looks good.  uh, professor wiseman made it.  ohh... uhhuh...  huh.  wow.  look at that cake.  we made twoone for the bake sale and one for rescue squad 186.  mmm.   i want to try some of these formulas...  ii mean "recipes." they seem so easy now.  like gene splitting.  now that george knew all about cooking, he didn't need to ask the chef about the failed muffins.  ah.    boy: george is a monkey.  he helped professor wiseman bake muffins, but they should have used a recipe.  today we are at a bakery called bread and chocolate.  girl: eunice and steve are the owners of the bakery we're gonna make muffins...  out of squash.  how are we gonna make muffins out of those.  we're going to split into two groups.  girl: both groups are following the same basic recipe, and we are carefully measuring all the ingredients.  if you don't measure it the right way, it won't turn out perfect.  but where the creativity comes in is, how can we take something out of the ordinary and make a really good muffin.  what do you think we can do with these squashes.  uncle is blending it, and now it's all soft and squishy.  and the other group has chopped bits.  i think grating is a good idea.  grating means you're pretty much cutting something into really tiny slices.  and i think that the muffins might taste different.   all right. our muffins are ready.  one from each group.  girl: our muffin was smoothtasting because weblendedthe squash.  with their muffin, we could taste all the little bits of squash they put in.  boy: i like the girls' muffin better than ours.  for more fun
