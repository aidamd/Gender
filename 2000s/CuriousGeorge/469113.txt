"bean burrito".   is this from a menu..  oh.  you think gnocchi likes burritos better than bolognese.  gnocchi would never do that.  or would she.  no.  well, maybe.  no.  ah. i cannot take it anymore.  i must know where she's eating these burritos.  why not follow her.  me.  follow agnocchi.  oh, the scampering, the leaping.    the chef was right.  you had to be a cat to follow a cat.  or a monkey.   georgio, you will follow my gnocchi.  uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.  if gnocchi was eating burritos, george would find out.  but early the next morning, instead of going to a burrito place...   gnocchi went to a boat.  but why would gnocchi go to a boat.   george was determined to find out.     maybe there were burritos in those bags.   george would show the chef.   endless park didn't have bean burritos either.  it had trees.   and construction sites don't have burritos.   they have beams.   and some kind of cloth.   but a mexican restaurantnow, that has burritos.   but gnocchi wasn't interested in burritos.  she just wanted to scratch on the board.   man: stay away from our menus.   wwhayou mean, they did not even feed her.  uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.  so gnocchi doesn't like someone else's food better...  she just doesn't like me.    oh, i'm sure that's not true.  oh, my little alley catwhy does she roam.  she used to play all day right here in the alley.  but now...   hmm.  gnocchi didn't just play in the alley, she played with thethings in the alley.  but the chef had cleaned them away.  george wondered what gnocchi liked to play with.  the material on the back of the carpet was like the bags of rice near the boat.  the chef's old door was like the tree in endless park.  they were both wood.  the canvas in the alley was just like the one at the construction site.  and the cardboard was like the menu at the mexican restaurant.  and gnocchi was doing the same thing in most of the photosscratching.  aha.  she wasn't looking for food, she was looking for places to scratch.   if you wanted to keep your alley cat at home, maybe you needed places to scratch like the ones where she roamed.   the back of the carpet was scratchy, just like the bags of rice near the boat.  ah.  hmm.  but where was he going to get a tree.    isn't it beautiful.  ah.   now, george needed some canvas cloth.  the man's painter pants would do just fine.  ah.  he could put the canvas on this bucket.   the last to scratch off his list was cardboard.  now that he'd gathered all his materials, he just had to put them together.  his scratching post was all set.    but gnocchi didn't think it was up to scratch.  maybe the chef was right...  andgnocchi would always be an alley cat who roamed.   but what if george found a way for gnocchi to roam at home.   in chef pisgghetti's basement, he stacked his carpet pieces like bags of rice...  ...turned his crate into a tree...  he set his canvas up high...  aha.  ...and his boxes became a menu board.   only instead of burritos, it had bolognese.  now came the hard part: waiting.     you think this will keep my gnocchi at home, georgio.   gnocchi.  i have a surprise for you.   oh, she doesn't come.  it is hopeless.    mygatto piccolo.  she's here.  she likes it.  she really likes it.  quick, netti, get the accordion.  now that gnocchi was scratching at home, soon there would be pasta al dente for everyone.  boy: george made things that gnocchi can scratch.   we are making things to challenge animals.  today we're at stone zoo.  woman: well, our animals here, they're not as active as the animals in the wild, so we want them to use their brain and think about where they can find food.  boy: we're making enrichment toys.  these toys challenge the zoo animals and get them thinking and moving.  we're making toys for the animals with food inside.  we used paper, we used cardboard boxes.  and then we put it out here.  look. he's going through my wrap that i made.   oh. whoa.  oh, they got mine.  the bear just, like, "i need my food. i need my energy." he used his hands to grab it on and used his tongue and mouth and just smelled, and they love it.  narrator: george loved to travel.    but this time was even better because he was traveling with his friend marco.  wow.  man: here we are.   hey, george.   buenas dias,marco.  hola,professor wiseman.  all ready for a weekend in the sun.  yeah.   man: okay, all set.  since you paddled out, i'll paddle back.  hmm, where are the paddles.  don't need them.  we're walking.  huh.  the raft is for the boys and the luggage.  huh.  but how can they touch bottom.   it's low tide.  plus we're standing on a sandbar.  huh.  mmhmm, it's a big pile of sand, only underwater.  the tide brought it in.    you remember the tide, george.  the moon pulls on the ocean and makes the water come in and go out.  oh...   hmm.  wait until you see the tidal pool.  the tide makes those, too.  sounds fun.   george and marco were amazed by the tidal pools.  what do you guys think.   marco: look at all this.  it had fish...  starfish and anemones.  ooh. ah.  and clams.   hey, if you dig deep enough, maybe you'll find buried treasure.  buried treasure.  ah.  rumor has it the early explorers buried some around here somewhere, but no one's ever found it.  hey, i bet we could find it.  whoo. uhhuh.  hey.  but finding buried treasure was harder than they thought.   the problem with looking for buried treasure on the beach is...  there's too much beach.   you know what we should do.   we should make ourownburied treasure.  oh...  yeah.   luckily, monkeys always have lots of treasure with them.    but...   i haven't put in any treasure.    i know.  i can put in this.   my silver wolf.  my uncle made it in honor of our band, lobos de plata.  it's my favorite thing ever.  oh.   now we need a way to remember where it's buried.  hmm...  hey.  good idea.  we could measure from the pier.    the treasure is five giant george steps away from the post with the rope on it.  uhhuh.   whoopee.        a dolphin.   i used to swim with dolphins back home.   i'm a really good swimmer.  want to know something neat.  uhhuh, uhhuh.  dolphins look like fish, but they're not.   really.  they breathe air from a hole on the top of their heads.    this one has been around people.  he's very friendly.  ooh.   wiseman: his pod comes in with the tide.   a pod is a group of dolphins that travel together.  ah...    i think he wants to play.    swimming with a dolphin was fun.  even if a dolphin swam a lot faster than you.   : wow.    come on, george, let's follow it underwater.  take a deep breath.      george and marco were surprised how long the dolphin could hold his breath.     the dolphin also made way cooler air bubbles.  ooh, i dropped my mask.    gracias.  ooh.   see, boys, dolphins are excellent at finding things.  did you hear those sounds they were making underwater.  uhhuh.   he's using his sonar.   the sounds bounce off the mask and tell him where to find it.  ah.  see you later.  hey, can't we just walk back.  i thought you could touch the bottom.  we could.  but the tide has been coming in while we've been playing, so now we can't.  hey, who moved the house.   the tide.  huh.  i mean, the house didn't move, we did.  e tide cried us down the shore while we were swimming.  uh, george, if the water's this deep, then where's our buried treasure.  huh.   what are you guys looking for.  we couldn't find any treasure, so we buried our own.  only, now it's underwater.  well, the good news is, the tide will be out again in about six hours.  i bet we'll find it then.    look, george.  our treasure chest.  the buried treasure wasn't buried anymore.  something had dug it up and moved it.   george, the tide doesn't just bring sand in, it takes it out, too.  that explains how the box got dug up, but how did it get over here.  and then he remembered.  the tide had carried them down the beach, so it must have carried their treasure chest, too.  aha.    oh, no.  our treasure.  it's gone.  well, i'm sure it's around here somewhere.  george was sad about his toys, but marco had lost his favorite thinghis silver wolf.  george had to find it.  hmm.  if the tide had carried them and the box down shore, maybe it had carried silver wolf even further down.  yeah. uhhuh.   silver wolf.  no.   : oh.  they'd never be able to find silver wolf way out there.   but they had a friend who could.  yay. great.   marco now had two treasures: silver wolf and a brandnew friend.  adios.  thank you, amigo.    george and marco learned about tidal pools.  we are going to be touching tidal pool creatures.  this is the perkins school for the blind.  today, samantha and erin are here from the new england aquarium.  they brought tidal pool creatures for us to touch.  this is a spider crab.  well, because we're blind, so we can't actually see, so we have to touch them instead.  omar, would you like to touch a sea star.  yes.  okay.  can you count how many arms it has.  five.  by touching them, we can recognize their texture.  samantha: this is a sea urchin.  do you feel the spikiness.  yeah.  they feel like porcupine quills, boy: each creature has a different texture or feel.  girl: rough textures, smooth textures, spiky textures.  many animals are on this planet, and i think this is a golden opportunity for me to get a chance to feel an animal.  it's very cool.  summersafari august.  george: ah ahh ahh ahhh.  vo: with the premiere of "curious george 3: back to the jungle" tmiyh: geoooooorge.  vo: a
