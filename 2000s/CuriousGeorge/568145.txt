"there goes the luckiest monkey on the face of the earth." girl: george is a monkey, so he can do things that you can't do.  girl 2: he put all the animals in the wrong places 'cause he wasn't using his map.  we're making maps and we're going to follow some maps.  today we are at the peabody essex museum.  my name is brooke, and you are going to use some maps.  girl: a map is something that you use to find stuff.  girl 2: we're supposed to make a map and then the next group is supposed to use our clues and our map.  these are our clues.  there's holes in its ears.  we also marked landmarks, the benches and that is a pot.  this is where we are right now.  boy: good luck.  boy: there are the benches right there. it should be over there.  i think it's a rabbit.  it has holes in the ears and...  the red thing is here and the rabbit is over there, next to the red thing.  hooray.  this is the red group map.  and look for an animal with brown fur and light fur.  good luck.  and if... if we walk into...  over there, there's another door to the side.  so if the dot's there, we go in there.  girl: look for brown fur.  and light fur. yeah.  boy: i think it's the monkey.  girls: yeah.  girl: it's a monkey like curious george.  it was a perfect summer day.  the kind of day that just makes you want to kick something over and over.  which is just what george was doing.  hey, you're improving, george.  you just need to keep practicing.  sure.  the way to get better at anything is with lots of practice.  ooh, hey.  you better get going.  you're dogsitting charkie today, right.  if only there was a way to dogsit and practice kicking.  hi, george.  thanks for doing this.  i'll only be at the hairdresser's for one hour.  i'd take charkie with me, but some people are allergic to dogs.  you're welcome to sit charkie in my apartment.  or you could stay outside.  charkie likes the park.  all right.  have fun.  oh, betsy and steve say once or twice charkie has slipped away, so please keep an eye on her.   if charkie could get off her leash this easily, george would never get a chance to practice kicking...  unless he did it right here.  it wasn't the park, but it'd do.  and best of all, it had its own soccer goal.  some dogs don't know the difference between play and practice.   chasing charkie did have its rewards.   charkie wasn't gonna squeeze under there again.  now practice.   huh.  uhuh, uhuh.  george needed to stop her from getting through the gate.        dogsitting sure didn't involve any sitting...  or soccer practice.  he kept her from going under or through the gate.  now he had to keep her from going through window.  this metal desk was heavy enough to keep charkie right here.    it looked like george had to just sit there and watch the dog, because every time he thought he had every escape covered, charkie escaped anyway.   he didn't have to watch her if he could hear exactly where she was.  now he could practice in peace.     george realized a good player must learn to ignore distractions like mooing dogs.  huh.   george really lost charkie this time.  he couldn't even hear that dog mooing anymore.   huh.   is that your dog.  she lost her mooer.  here. she's the best soccer goalie i ever saw... with four legs.  george didn't think charkie even liked soccer.  he didn't need a leash or a fence to keep charkie from running away.  charkie didn't want to escape.  she was just looking for someone who'd play ball with her.  there you are.  oh, i'm glad i came back when i did.  this gate's open.  good thing charkie didn't notice.  she's very lively.  once or twice she's run away.  we're going to the park, george.  would you like to come.  uhhuh. uhhuh.  whoa.  if you fall behind, look for us in the par....  george would get lots of practice now.  charkie was the greatest soccer partner imaginable...  except for the dog drool on the ball problem.  bo boy: george is a monkey and sometimes he does things that we can't do.  he was making a place to keep charkie, but she kept getting away.  we're building a new home for the guinea pigs.  girl: a bigger home so they can crawl around and be happy.  this could be, like, a tunnel that the guinea pigs could go through.  then we're going to cut the hole.  we can put the tube right in the hole, so they can get in their other part of the house.  teacher: this is something only an adult can do.  i know.  this tunnel is here so they can get to that room if they want to get in that room.  teacher: and we have to see if the guinea pigs can get through.   he doesn't fit.  his back is so big.  we just take 'em out and then make sure these holes are exactly lined up.  the guinea pigs can crawl just through the holes.  boy: let's try it.  teacher: uhoh.  girl: i think you should make the hole a little bit bigger.  teacher: what do you think.  boy: yes.   teacher: is it working.  yeah.  girl: because the holes were bigger and they had enough space to fit all of the guinea pig through.  lly chattering) for more fun with curious george and his friends, visit your local library and read more curious georgeadventures.  or visit thecurious georgeweb site at:
