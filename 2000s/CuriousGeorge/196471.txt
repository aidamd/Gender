george: ooh.  ahh.  narrator: saturdays were the best day to stand on the dock and watch boats.  oh, boy.   there were tugboats and motorboats and dachshunds and...  dachshunds.   hey, it's hundley.  hundley loved everything about sailinghow the sails sounded when they caught the wind, how the doorman used the wind in the sails to make the boat go faster and how there was all that water between their boat and the nearest sloppy monkey.  hey.  i never knew you guys sailed.  sure.  hundley likes sailing so much, i put a boat in his dish.  ooh.  huh.  ahh.  now, drinking water reminds him of sailing, which makes him happy.  if you want to see some great sailing ships, watchpirates of the wybecuzztonight.  any show about sailing ships sounded good to hundley.  it's so good, the first time i saw it, i wishediwas a pirate.  since thiswasa sailboat, george wanted to be the wind and make it go.    huh.  let's go, george.   natural geometric exploring presents pirates of thewybecuzz.  wow.  how'd you like to sail a ship like that, hundley.  now,therewas a ship that couldn't be sunk by monkey breath.  announcer : thes.s.wybecuzzwas attacked by the bold pirate black hat bsame.  men: arrgh.  pirate vessel off the port bow.  all hands to your stations.  haul wind, coxswain.   those ships were so dignified and neat, wouldn't it be great to be an oldtime captain.   the neatest ship to ever set sail was the s.s.dignified.  its commander was worldrenowned captain hundley.   no other captain was as smart, as orderly or had as wet a nose.  all's clear, captain hundley, sir.  thankyou,sir.  you know how much your approval means to me, sir.  captain hundley's crew was always orderly and efficient.    no one knew how to ride the breezes like captain hundley, the greatest sailor in the history of wind.  but all was not smooth sailing.  ow.  a new crewman came aboard during a stop in the dry tortugas.  new first mate george was a sloppy monkey with a jelly sandwich.     byebye.  uhoh.  uhoh.   but captain hundley didn't worry.   oh.  hey.  he put that monkey in the brig and kept his ship dignified.   all was orderly again until...  captain hundley.  pirate vessel off the port bow.  huh.  the wind was so strong, the pirates were upon thedignified before captain hundley could give orders.  the pirates were led by...  yellow hat the pirate.  he's famous, you know.  hi. how are ya.  we're taking over your ship because, um, well, you know, that's...  that's what pirates do.  pirates: arrgh.  and that.  arrgh.   everything the pirates did was as undignified as that "arrghing" ohh...  arrgh.  arrgh.  arrgh.  arrgh.  arrgh.  arrgh.  arrgh.  arrgh.  arrgh.  arrgh.  arrgh.  arrgh.  but the most undignified thing wasn't putting captain hundley in his own brig.  it was this.  who are you.  hello.  i like you already.  ah.  come on out and have fun with us.  byebye.    i am very impressed, george.  what do you guys think.  arrgh.  arrgh.  arrgh.  arrgh.  arrgh.  arrgh.   george snuck down with something to cheer up sad captain hundley.    eh.  ah.  uhuh.  that flag always reminded the bold captain how dignified his ship was.  george wanted to hang it up where captain hundley could enjoy it.   uhoh.  ohh.  uhoh.  then george got an idea about how he could really help captain hundley.  aha.   ohh. ohh. ohh.   ohh.   where is that good little monkey.  george, are you down here.  oh, my goodness.  i mean, argh.  wake up.  put on life vests.  we're filling with water.  sinking. we gotta get back to our own ship.  all: argh. argh. argh.  uhoh.  intrepid captain hundley instantly took control of the situation.   the wind's out of the northwest at 30 knots, captain.   ohh.  captain hundley used the wind perfectly, and they set sail.  george. george.  argh. argh.  george.   huh. oh.  aw, what's up, boy.  have a scary dream.  oh. boat. oh.   that was the strangest dream any dachshund ever had.  after thinking about sinking, hundley thought that maybe, if his boat wasn't weighed down with water, maybe it would still float.  and it did.   so george hadn't ruined his boat.  he had just sunk it.  hey, that sounds fun.  doesn't it, george.  uhhuh.  say, hundley, your good pal george is gonna come out on the boat with us today.  huh.  at least hundley knew what to expect, so he was prepared.  oh.   girl: george is a monkey.  so he can do things that you can't do.  boy: he put a hole in the boat and it sank.  today we're playing with stuff in the pool.  these are goggles.  it floats when there's no water in it.  but when there's water, it starts tipping over, then lots of water goes in, then it sinks.  this is a big red cherry ball.  this is a plastic baseball with holes.  it's floating lower than the red cherry ball because it has a lot more holes.  i made the green boat sink by tipping it a little and water got in, air got out and then it started sinking.  we're going to try and make these things sink.  we fill it with water by pushing it down and it slowly sinks down.  this is a broken brick.  i'm going to put in the milk jug and put it in the water and see what happens.  cool.  it's still floating.  i'm going to go get another rock.  the milk jug sunk.  and i just move the rock to the side, so this side is going to weigh much more.  i'm kind of changing the balance, and that's how it can sink.  making stuff sink is fun.  narrator: the window of dulson's toy store was impossible to walk past without stopping.  oh.  hey, what do you say we stop in here for just a second.  okay, george.   crunchie banana bars.  remember, don't eat them all in one day or you'll get another tummy ache.  don't worry, mrs. dulson.  i learned my lesson last time.   you remember what we agreed.  any extra toys you buy with your allowance.  uhhuh. uhhuh.  mmm. he gets a dollar a week for doing his chores.  the toy boat costs five dollars, george.  let's see. one, two, three, four, five.  i'm sorry, george, but it will take 500 pennies to buy a boat.  huh.  yeah. let's go home and count up the rest of your savings.  george, you've been searching for 15 minutes.  don't you haveanymoney saved.  oh...  aha.  that's it.  oh.  oh, so that's where most of it is.  uhhuh.  ah.  oh.  hmm. you really need to organize your funds, buddy.  i know just the thing for you.   it's just like the one i saved my money in when i was your age.  okay, george, let's feed piggy.  one, two, three, four, five.  and... six, seven, eight, nine, ten cents.  and five pennies is the same as one nickel.  ooh.  a little extra to get you started.  now you have 15 cents.  oh...  well, george, you won't find any more nickels in your ears.  that was my little magic trick.  ah.   let's see, if you save your dollar allowance every week, you'll have that new boat in one, two, three, four, five weeks.   or you could do extra chores and get it even sooner.  saving money sounded good to george...  so he started doing extra chores right away.  um, george.  where are you.  i thought you were going to dust the roo...  george: aha.  what.  wow. i don't think anyone's ever dusted up there before.  thanks.  huh.  oh, is that why you gave me this.  well, thank you, george.  oh, i get it.  thank you.  goodbye, george.  george, i can't pay you for things i usually do myself.  that's why i wouldn't let you brush my teeth.  oh.   but here's a 20 cent advance on next week's allowance.  five, ten, 15, 20 cents.  how could george earn more money.  chef pisghetti might need some help doing kitchen chores.  there's always work for a good pasta detangler.  no knots.  great, giorgio.  my new slogan's gonna be, "pisghetti's spaghetti: it's knot free." get it.  knot with a "k".  i love this monkey.  piggy was heavier than ever, but he wasn't full yet.  how else could george earn money.  ooh.   george thought pisghetti's would be a good location, but he wasn't making much money.  poor giorgio.  he's trying to earn money to buy a boat, but nobody seems to appreciate his music.  i think i can make everybody happy.  george, those are really nice instruments.  can i buy them for a dollar.  huh.  these are quarters, george, each one is the same as 25 pennies.  oh.  25, 50, 75, 100 pennies and that equals one dollar.   congratulations, george, your piggy bank is full.  now why don't we open your bank and see if a pig's worth of pennies is enough to buy the boat you want.  hmm.  huh.  i know how to get your money out.  let's go to my house.  with piggy's help, george had saved his money.  now his big dream was about to come true.  here you go, george.  this is the kind of piggy you have to break open.  it's so you won't be tempted to spend your savings.  okay, we'll think of another way.  okay, go, george.   whew.  maybe if we put piggy in the clothes dryer the coins would shake out.  but it may break it, too.  uhuh, uhuh, uhuh.   charkie, stay.  charkie, no.   well, charkie solved the howtoopenpiggy problem.  well, its eight dollars exactly.  you have enough for your boat, plus three dollars left over.  george had his boat...  but he was going to miss piggy.  aha.  oink, oink, oink.  oh, the piggy bank.  that's one dollar and you have three.  any idea what you'll save for this time, george.   girl: george is a monkey.  so he can do things you can't do.  boy: there were a lot of coins to count in his piggy bank.  woman: we have some carnival games, and you have to pay with the exact change.  girl: a penny is worth one cent.  boy: a nickel is worth five cents.  boy 2: a dime is worth ten cents, even though it's the smallest.  boy: and a quarter is worth 25 cents.  this game cost 29 cents.  boy: i have two quarters.  a quarter is worth 25 cents, and it's 29 cents...  so i would need four pennies.  i have to go to the bank.  girl: christian gave the bank a quarter.  that's 25 cents.  and we gave him back five pennies and two dimes.  that's also 25 cents.  now he's got some pennies.  he adds them to a quarter to make 29 cents.  and now he can play.   for more fun with curious george and his friends, visit your local library and read morecurious george adventures.  or visit the curious george web
