sponsored by nbc/universal narrator: it was an exciting day to be a door dog because he and the doorman were expecting a very exciting delivery.    didn't you sleep last night.   me neither.  i was too excited about our big delivery.  oh, boy, are we glad to see you.   narrator: when the doorman said, "a big delivery," he meant a big delivery.    what's in this thing.  my western town.  a whole town.   in a box.  huh.  uhhuh. it's for my train set.  i wish i could set it up right now, but i'm on duty.   yeah, we'll set it up.  we love trains.  hey, thanks.   okay.  kids: cool.  yeah, uhhuh.  hundley and the doorman had built the most amazing train set ever.  there was a future town, a farm town and even a mountain town.   the western town goes right there.   relax, hundley.  george and his friends will be very careful.  uhhuh.  sure.  absolutely.   it's okay, fella.  if you're worried, why don't you stay here and keep an eye on them.  you can nap when they're done.   hundley would not rest until the last piece of track had been laid.  ooh.  but before hundley knew it, the west was done.  betsy: doesn't it look great.   ha, ha, ha.   uhoh, the track is missing a pin.  see.   all: there it is.   oh, excuse me.  sorry.      the pin was lost.  don't worry, we'll find it.   not only was the pin lost...  but the apartment was a wreck.     i wish there was a quick way to sift through all this dirt.  ah.   hey.  good idea, george.  we can make sifters with our fingers.    but sifting is a slow business...  and boring.   it made a sleepy dog even sleepier.   ha.  i feel like a miner in some old western movie.    oh, my darling, oh, my darling    oh, my darling little pin    first we had you, then we lost you    wish we'd see you once again   :  first we had you, then we lost you    wish we'd see you once again.    morning, deputy.   big day today with the train tracks joinin' up.   i wrote a little song all about it.  would you like to hear it.   it goes something like this.    prairieville was neat and clean    had the best sheriff you've ever seen    his deputy was on the ball     though he was just inches tall     prairieville    prairieville, way out yonder    further still    prairieville    prairieville, stuck out in nowhereiville    but all that's about to change    when the tracks join across the range    when the tracks join across the range.     howdy, deputy.  time to mosy over to the tracks.   everything was set for the ceremony.  the deputy was confident it would all go without a hitch.   but suddenly...  a stranger rode in.   a stranger could be bad news.     oops.       ah.  tadah.  ooh.    man: well, aren't you a cute little fella.  did you just get into town.  uhhuh.  ah.  want to come see the train tracks get joined.   : yep...  the deputy had to keep an eye on that one.  citizens of prairieville, welcome to the ceremony for the joining of the rails.   and to drive in the last pin, sheriff doorman.    woman: what.  oh, dear.  i've lost the pin.   all: here it is.   sorry.  excuse me.   oh, no.    oh, no.  this was awful.  hundley had to find that pin.   man: need a hand, partner.  girl: we feel just awful about losing the pin.   hmm.  man:  prairieville    prairieville    we won't be going nowhere until    we find the pin    that flew away    and ruined the    ceremonay     mmhmm, and ruined    the    ceremonay.     this is hopeless.  the deputy thought she might be right.  there was too much sand.  then the stranger realized all they needed was a siftersomething with holes that would let the dirt out but keep the pin in.  oh. uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.   man: who's hungry.   after all, what's a western without a...  :  ooheeooheeooh...    the spaghetti.    narrator: perfect. a really big sifter.    narrator: the deputy hoped the holy bowl would save the day.  oh.  oh.  only it didn't.  the holes were too big to keep the small pin inside.  any luck finding the pin.  uhuh.   last piece of pie.  sure you don't want some.  oh. ah.  narrator: suddenly, the stranger knew what to do.  if he wanted a sifter with holes the right size...  all: huh.   narrator: ...he'd have to make it himself.  luckily, he knew how big the holes needed to be.    oh.  narrator: this was bigger than the pin from the box.  if the stranger used it to make holes, the pin would fall through them.  but this was a perfectsized nail.  it would make a hole that would let the dirt out, but keep the pin in.  aha.     narrator: well, i'll be.  betsy: hey, there it is.   hey.  great job, deputy.  whoa.   hey, there it is.  huh. way to go, hundley.  you've got the best sifter of all.  yeah, your nose.  oh.   now, who should put in the pin.  we don't want to lose it again.  hey, my town.  it's all set up.  ah.  aw. and you saved the last pin for me.   cool.  ooh.  ooh.    narrator: hundley was happy the train was back on track.   doorman: this is great.  and i've got the perfect name for it.  hundleyville.  what do you think of that, hundley.  uh, hundley.   prairieville was neat and clean    had the best sheriff you've ever seen    his deputy was on the ball...   kid: george is a monkey.  he helped the doorman set up his western town train tracks.  girl: we are doing something with marble tracks.  girl 2: the marbles run by themselves, and that's real action.  kid: gravity is the force that causes the marbles to roll down.  it's stuck in there.  the marbles are getting jammed because this turn is too sharp.  we should put a piece that's maybe more flexible.  boy: we solved the problem.  kid: kelyn worked on a very complicated ramp system.  if a marble falls down there, it might go, like, whee, swish.  kid: then the marbles should go right into the egg carton.  yay. it went in the hole.  it's fun to do.  because of the action.  narrator: today was a busy day at george's apartment.  professor wiseman was coming to dinner, and the man with the yellow hat wanted everything to be just right.  i have an idea.  why don't i finish getting the apartment ready, and you go to the store.  ah. uhhuh.  great. let's make a list.  okay.  okay, i need carrots for my famous carrot cake...  ah. uhuh.  ...cucumbers for my famous cucumber soup...  okay.  ...and uh, apples for my famous, uh, bowl of apples.   here's a bag and some money, george.  and have fun.   byebye.   narrator: when george got to their favorite store, it was closed.  oh.  the grocer was on his annual fishing trip.  oh.  oh.  hi.  ah.  welcome to hoa mai grocery and takeout.  it's grand opening.  ooh.  we are selling vietnamese food.  please

uhuh.  huh.  ah. yeah.   now this looked like an apple.  now all george needed to find were the carrots.   were these carrots.  george didn't know for sure, but they looked like carrots and were bunched up like carrots.   ah, customer number one.  you're ready.  uhhuh. uhhuh.  ah, let's see.  you have akho qua, uh, somephat thu, and a fewthach lu'u.  very good choices.  ah.   here you are.

uhhuh.  oh.  but this is a pomegranate, george, not an apple.  huh.  yes, and i don't know what these other things are.  ah.   uh, thanks, george.  narrator: george decided that this time, he'd ask for help.  you're back.  hi. my name's mai.  ah. oh.  can i help you.  ooh, yeah.  phat thu, thach lu'u andkho qua.  yum. but...  didn't you just buy these.  uhhuh. uhhuh.   oh, is that an alligator.

arms.    yeah, that's great.  uh, then would you slice the cucumbers into the soup and put the apples in the fruit bowl. thanks, george.   okay, i think we finally have things under control.  uhhuh.

something that tasted so good in the store taste so bad in the soup.  i'm sure youcouldmake a good soup with eggplant, but this was a recipe for cucumber soup. heh.   well, we still have...  oh, ten minutes.  oh, well, i guess we should just order takeout.  huh.  ooh... yeah.   but i...  where are you going.  george.     customer number one.  you are back.  and i think i know why.  you dropped
