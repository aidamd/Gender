always on the lookout for interesting things.  but sometimes, his friend, the man with the yellow hat, saw them first.   look, george, a frog.      no matter.  keep watching the pond.  ribbit. ribbit.   huh.   yay.  well, i'll be.  that's quite a talent there.   i don't know about that.  well, i do.  i'm putting you in the town talent show.  me.  in front of people.  no, no, ii couldn't.  i get stage fright.  oh, nonsense.  you'll be terrific.  how about you.  you have any talent.  uh... uhuh.  hey, george.  are you in the show.  uhuh.  great. you can help me.  i'm doing the tech stuff: ropes, ladders, curtains.  i sure could use a hand.  ooh. uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.  should be a packed house.  : yeah.  rehearsal's just starting.  come on, i'll show you the ropes.   these are the ropes.  oh.  our job is the most important.  without us, the curtain doesn't go up.  in other words, no show.  ooh, uhhuh.  and in a theater, it's the law that the show must go on.   this rope goes up through that pulley, across to another pulley, and down, to raise or lower that scenery, which we stagehands call "flats." numbers on the flats match numbers below the ropes.  you release the rope lock, then pull the rope.  but make sure the counterweights are attached first, or else...    or else that happens.   first up we have, sprint, who will be candancing.   these levers pull wires attached to latches that open trap doors, so we can drop stuff below the stage.  the trap door system works this way.  see those squares.  uhhuh.  you count "one, two, three" from left to right, and then abc from front to back.  oh.   oh, careful.   it's okay.  that's what rehearsal is for.  it's just important not to mess up on show night.    okay, this blue rope opens and closes the curtain.  see. it goes up to those pulleys and is attached to the curtain.  don't be afraid.  try it.    perfect.   okay, this cue is the hardest one.  first, i push this button to fire the confetti cannon. uhhuh.  then you close the curtain.  uhhuh. i'll open trap "2b" so mrs. renkins' props will disappear below stage.  uhhuh.  while you raise flat four.  uhhuh.  and finally, i open the curtain for the last act. got it.   last act.  any time you're ready.  okay.  uh, oh... ahem.  sorry, frog in my throat.  little...  good one. i'm sure you'll be fine tomorrow.  that's a wrap.   ribbit. ribbit.  rebbit. robbit.   so that night, they practiced...  and practiced.  and by show time, they were as ready as could be.  i won't freeze up.  i can do this.   wow, a full house.   just remember, it's our job to see that the show goes on no matter what.   and before they knew it, the show was going on.  no matter what act.  no matter what stage direction.  fly flat three.  the show went on.     and on.  and neither george nor bill missed a single cue.  but the most difficult cue was still to come.   she's out in all weather, looks stylish in leather...   we're doing great.  just that one big cue left, remember.  uhhuh, uhhuh.   it's not her sirloin steaks    it's the milk she makes...   one, confetti.  two, curtain.  three, trap door.  four, flat.  five, curtain. got it.  uhhuh.  mrs. renkins:  what starts in her udder    ends up as fresh butter    or milk or cream or yogurt...  uhoh.  someone could trip.   everything she eats turns into lactose treats    from an ice cream sundae to a taco with cheese   got it. george, pull trap 3c.  uhhuh.  no. 1c.      no.   huh.  that was odd.  bill was usually so responsible.    : you can do this.  one minute.    what starts in her udder, ends up as fresh butter    or milk or cream or yogurt if you please...    where could he be.  : nice skunk.  please don't spray me.    milking makes her happy    just see her wag her tail    a thousand squirts, it never hurts    when i fill up my pail.   okay, just breathe normally.   whoa.  neptune's knickers.  a skunk.   just don't alarm it.  : oh.  george knew the skunk could spray at any moment and ruin the show, but he also knew the show must go on.  don't upset the skunk.  he's gonna spray. he's gonna spray.   so george concentrated real hard...    and counted.  one, abc.      she's a topsyturnsy    purebred guernsey, fourlegged miracle of nature    the cow.        oh.  hi.  uh, i was going to do some frog calls for you.    here we go...  ribbit.  ribbit.  : ribbit.   george, you were amazing.  maybe the best stagehand ever.   and that's about it.   curtain call, everyone.  you fellas, too.  you know, with all the chaos, i didn't have time to think about being scared, so i wasn't.  i must say, those were some fine frog calls.  oh, you're just being kind.   wow.   kid 1: george is a monkey.s a monkey, so he can do stuff that we can't do.  mmhmm.  boy: he was controlling the scenery with ropes and pulleys.  we found a box of pulleys and rope.  katie's dad set up a pulley system for us.  so we're sending each other things.  okay, thanks for the balls, mister.  push this rope this way, and the basket goes to jen.  when the top rope goes this way, this rope goes that way, so the basket goes to leon.  a water ball. wow.  now we are pulling our own weight.  when i pull in one direction, the other rope goes in the other direction, and it brings the stuff to the other side.  now we need to use the pulley to pull a lot of weight.  whoa.  whaa.   narrator: george thought the best vegetables in the world came from the market.  i was thinking about making vegetable soup tonight...   but that got me thinking about chef pisghetti's fresh vegetable soup and spinach ravioli.   are you thinking what i'm thinking, george.  uhhuh. uhhuh. uhhuh.  man: minestrone with extra carrots and spinach ravioli for two.  chef pisghetti: netti, stop.  don't take their order.  huh.  is something wrong, chef pisghetti.  wrong. oh, yes.  i am all out of carrots and spinach.  i, pisghetti, have failed you.  chef, can't you just go get some fresh vegetables.  i don't want to keep them waiting.  we'd wait all night for your fresh vegetables, chef. uhhuh.  they're the reason we come here.  uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.  you want to help me get fresh veggies off the roof, giorgio.  narrator: did he say the roof.  doesn't the grocer make the fresh vegetables at the market.  you see other veggies grow on farms far away, then they travel to a store, where they sit around until you buy them.  my veggies grow here, go down to the kitchen, then to your belly on the same day.  narrator: george didn't see any carrots here.  veggies come from dirt.  weeds.  weeds. ugh, monsteroso.  oh, weeds are bad.  very bad.  see, weeds like this soak up the water and nutrients from the soil that my veggies need to grow.  if my veggies can't grow, my food won't be pisghetti fresh and if it's not, i will close down.  oh.  yes, i will close my restaurant before i let anyone think pisghetti is not the best they ever tasted.  i must pull those weeds, but after working hard all day, i'm too tired to get it all done.  oh.  narrator: george couldn't stop thinking about chef pisghetti's weed problem.  "after working hard all day, was too tired to get his work done." huh.  i didn't think you were paying attention.  i'll start again.  "the shoemaker and the elves." "once there was a shoemaker who, after working hard all day, was too tired to get his work done.  "i am too tired to get it all done," he thought.  "but if i don't, my customer will have but one shoe and may hop over to another cobbler." he couldn't stay awake.  as he slept, an amazing thing happened...  elves did his work for him.  when the cobbler awoke, he didn't know how that shoe got finished.  hmm.  narrator: george wondered if a little monkey could be an elf for a chef.  first thing the next morning, george did some secret elf weeding.     george dug up every nasty green thing he saw.  three bags full.  hello, giorgio.  you want to come help me get fresh veggies for today's food.  uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.  now it was time for elf george to see how happy he'd made the chef.  i'm ruined.   it's all gone.  the weeds and almost all my veggies.  what am i gonna cook.   maybe all those nasty green things george pulled weren't weeds.   luckily they were all right downstairs in the can.  huh.    oh.  what could do this.  roof gophers.  i must replant everything quickly.   well, vegetables grow from those seeds.  these will be carrots.  those are squash and eggplant.  i water and fertilize them, and new veggies will grow right here.   it takes three or four months. that's a long...  time.  until then, i have no fresh veggies to cook with.  so veggies in the store came from a garden, and veggies in a garden came from seeds.  okay, we're all planted.  if only the seeds could magically grow overnight, my problems would be solved.   maybe elf george could help.  he needed to count how many carrot seeds were planted.  and then he had to get the same amount of carrots from his refrigerator.  huh.   george wondered if the chef would be as happy as a cobbler this time.  i'm going up to water the garden.  netti, i think we should close the restaurant until the fresh veggies grow.  no, we can buy some from the store.  ah, but they won't taste pisghetti fresh.  oh, look at this. netti, gnocchi, look.  it's a miracle of carrots.  it's impossible, chef.  carrots can't grow from seeds overnight.  i told you.  but they did.  and i need to know how it happened so i can make it happen again.  so, could you study my dirt.  i'll give you free pizza.  okay, i'll run tests.  can i keep the carrot.  no. sorry.  i'm making soup.   oh, giorgio. hey, look at the carrots we planted.  already grown.  you know, as long as i have my fresh veggies, i won't have to close down.   george felt like he'd made a good elf.  but i wonder why the eggplants and squash did not grow.  oh, he'd forgotten the eggplants and squash.  later, i'm agonna plant those.  if it works again, tomorrow we'll have peas and arugula.   eggplant, squash, but where were peas and arugula.  how could george be an elf without fresh vegetables.  aha.   ah, hello, professor wiseman.  our dirt is just normal dirt.  no, i don't know yet if it happened again.   netti, it's ahappened again.  we got eggplant.  we got squash.  come and see.   squash. eggplant.  i'm coming right over.  don't... make... soup.  einstein. pizza.  meet me at pisghetti's stat.  are you buying.  we're not eating, we're being scientists.  uh, george.  did you, um, do something whichidon'tknowwhatitwouldpossiblybe with all of our vegetables.  you're feeding a vegetarian cobbler.  uhuh.   did you plant a can of peas.  : they're growing in cans now..  netti, call the tv news...   oh, boy.  oh, hi, everybody.  i, well, um, this would be mine.  you see, george wanted, wanted to be your elf.  oh, you did this.  so my garden would grow fast.  mmhmm.  oh, netti, our garden is not magic.  ah, but your cooking still is.  well, you got me there.  that's right, i'm great.  i'm gonna cook all these veggies up as lunch for everybody.  come on. i'm hungry.  girl: george is a monkey, and sometimes he can do things that we can't do.  he didn't know about planting seeds to grow food.  this is linden tree farm.  girl: it's a farm you can join to get a share of what they grow.  can we plant these.  man: well, those sugar snap peas are just at the perfect stage to eat.  if you left the pea on the vine and didn't pick them when they were fresh and young, they would become old and tough and dry like this.  and this is the stage where you plant them.  would you guys like to help me plant some.  we're gonna just make a shallow trench, and we're gonna plant them in this trench.  the best part is when you come back for the eating of the sugar snap peas.   girl: the peas grew for about two months, and finally...  whoa. this is humungo.  oh, that is so sweet.  it tastes just like a big sack of sugar.  help me out.  here are the eyes.  and i think they go here.  no. no.  oops. no. they go up here.  and below we're going to put the nose.  now, what goes down here on the bottom.  the mouth. the mouth.  right. the mouth.  hey, it's curious
