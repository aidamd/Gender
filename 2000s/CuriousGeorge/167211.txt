 in a car or a pickup truck      wheels    you need wheels to get you down the road    or to carry a heavy, heavy load    just imagine you're a rover exploring mars    without wheels, you wouldn't get very far    well, they're circular shapes that spin around      wheels    connect 'em to an axle and go to town      wheels    rolling in the sun and in the rain    you put your foot to the pedal    the pedal to the chain    you can go biking up a mountainside    you just choose a direction    and go for a ride on your wheels    that's how we're rolling on wheels    it's what we're rolling on    wheels    whoohoo    this program was made possible by: believe curiosity can fuel a lifetime of learning.  com early learning academy, proud sponsor of pbs kids and curious george.  that shoes are designed for kids to be as active as their imaginations.  all she knows is that, today, purple is her favorite color, and that's good enough for us.  stride rite is a proud sponsor " at houghton mifflin harcourt, we believe reading opensnew worlds and inspires curiosityin learners of all ages.  we're proud to sponsor curious georgeon pbs kids.  funding forcurious george is provided by contributions to your pbs station...  ooh.  ...and from:   you never do know what's around the bend    big adventure or a brandnew friend    when you're curious like curious george   swing.   well, every day   every day   is so glorious   glorious  george.   and everything   everything   is so wondrous   wondrous   there's more to explore when you open the door    and meet friends like this, you just can't miss    i know you're curious   curious   and that's marvelous   marvelous   and that's your reward    you'll never be bored    if you ask yourself, "what is this."    like curious...    like curious...  curious george.   oh...  captioning sponsorored by nbc/universal  narrator: it's not every day that a monkey sees a plane writing words in the sky.  hey.   it says...  "come one, come all "to a totally unique wind symphony.  be there or be square." huh.  i have no idea what that means.  man : wind symphony.  one night only.  be there or be square.  but i guess we should be there.  i... certainly don't want to be square.  ah. uhuh.  huh...   george tried to imagine how a wind symphony might work.    hello.  hi.  did you hear about the wind symphony.  you got to be there...  ...or be square.  we know.  but what's a wind symphony.  it's something totally unique and right over your head.  come on, i'll show you.  behold. a symphony in the making.  and there's the maestroincharge.  man: mr. zoobel.  glass: yup.  last week he made me this beautiful pocket wind chime.  george: oh...  ah, when i heard this delicate sound, i thought...  let's make it 20 times bigger.  40 times.    man: so you want mr. zoobel to create a giant wind chime.  exactly. something that makes a lot of noise when the wind blows.  how's it coming, zoobel.  i'm sorry, but i'm an artist, not a musician.  i don't know if i can make this work.    ah, music to my ears.    i have faith in you, zoobel.  you'll think of something.  you have until saturday.  that's tomorrow.   hmm. say, george, do you want to help me make a wind symphony.  uh... okay.   okay, i have a bunch of ideas, george, but i don't know how to make them work.  first i want a lot of...  bong.    then i want a sound like a... foghorn.  uh...  oh.  yeah, yeah.  and after that, a sort of a...  tink, tink, tink.  tink, tink, tink, tink.  and then a nice, crisp, uh, snappy sound.  ooh. hmm.  let's start with the "bong." uh, got any ideas.  hmm...  maybe something in here would make a nice, loud bong.   eh...   uhuh.  uhuh.     uhuh.   hey.   exactly like that.  only a whole lot louder.    perfect.  a lot of pots.   the "whoo" i have in mind is kind of like this.   :  whoo...   :  whoo...   hmm.    ah...    pipes.  different sizes.  that took care of the "bong" and the "whoo." for the "tink, tink, tink," george made a careful sound analysis.  ooh.   too woody.   too papery.  uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.   aha.  that's it.  tink, tink, tink.  you did it, george.  now we just need 40 times as many.   saturday was here.  george and mr. zoobel had to work fast to get the wind symphony ready.   hey.  georgio. haha.  what can i get for you today.  some, uh, prosciutto, perhaps.  uh, actually, we'd like, um...  all the pots, pans and cutlery you can spare.  wha....    ooh, is it for the wind symphony..  netti and i have frontrow seats.  come, come this way.   these have all failed the pisghetti test of excellence.  i must take them to recycling.  butif you want any, help yourself.   we'll put your name in the program.  really..   i am deeply honored.  netti.  i am a patron of the arts now.   at the recycling center, george and mr. zoobel tested a lot of pipes.   ah.   there was one sound they were still missing.  yeah, i knowno snap yet.  well, we still have four hours to go until the concert.     you're right, george.  there's our snap.   all right.  luckily, there was plenty of snappy stuff back in george's apartment.      ready for pinning, george.   and look what we made.  aha.  i call this "dinner is served, opus 12." when the wind hits it...   ooh. aha.  george and mr. zoobel arranged the pipes...    uhhuh.  ...then tried to make the loudest "bong" they possibly could.    perfecto.  but we don't want justone"bong," right.  we wantlotsof "bongs." uhhuh.    oh, hang up the pots.  yeah.  well, this certainly looks loud.   and unique. bravo.  i think we'll be ready.  except there's no wind.  oh, not to worry.  when glass wants wind, glass gets wind.  watch this.  glass here.  just checking on that wind you promised.  right, mr. glass.  it, uh...  it hasn't arrived, yet.  but based on my sophisticated computer modeling...  ooh...  i can state categorically that wind will be arriving...  uh... soon.  no later than wednesday.  glass: wednesday..  oh, that's no good.  i need wind now.  oh, boy.  this is a disaster.  look.  all those people are expecting a worldclass symphonic event in... 23 minutes.  good luck, maestros.   yeah, you said it, george.  yeesh.  if the wind symphony was going to work, george had better go find some wind.  aha.   george grabbed anything that looked like it could make wind.  fans, the vacuum cleaner, thebellows from the fireplace, a piece of paper.  ohthis looked good, too.   this is so exciting.    i am one of the patrons.   did you know.  no, ii didn't.  congratulations.  glass : attention. attention please.  without further ado, let the symphony begin.  hit it, george.      it was working.  sort of.    this is the world's quietest wind symphony.  george bellowed until he could bellow no more.   ooh.   you're in luck, mr. glass.  i was able to call in the 57th street whirlybird squadron.  wind is on the way.  huh. ooh.   zoobel:  whew.  my arms are about to break.  oh, well.   aha. aha. huh. huh.   wind.  ah.        beautiful.  i'ma justa so proud.   escusi.  oh, what did i tell you, maestros.  when glass wants wind, glass gets wind.   haha.  girl: george is a monkey.  he helped mr. zoobel find things to make music.   ee, chee, vaah, barah.  group: barah.  my name is guy mendilow.  he makes music.   girl:guy showed us how to make instruments, and we did a shaker.    girl 2:each size bottle makes a different sound.   girl 3:a box with a hole makes the rubber band sound louder.    everybody now.  boy:i love to make music because it makes me happy and excited.  and out.   narrator: on saturdays in the country, monkeys like to wash cars.  ah.  all kinds of cars.   and sometimes...  allie: george.  ...they have a helper.  i got soap from grandma.  it's biodegradede...  i... i forget.  but it doesn't hurt plants or fish.  ah.  man: hey, guys.  instead of washing the car today, how'd you like to do something different, like get the car washed.  huh.  welcome to the brandnew fast dash automated car wash.  hey. huh.  yeah, we do it all: rinse, wipe, suds, scrubbers, final rinse, and a towel dry at the finish line.  ooh.  plus all our soap is biodegradable.  that's the word.  ah.   we'll take it.  come on in.   we get to ride with the car..  best seats in the house.   okay, you can shut her off.  great.  huh.  this was weird.  the car was turned off, but somehow, it was still moving.   isn't it great.  this is the best thing about an automated car wash.  it's automatic.  ooh.  we're on a conveyor.  those rails have rollers under them that carry us through the wash.   this is the first rinse.  oh.  wow. look at it go.   now the big wipe.  george & allie: fwap, fwap, fwap.  man : the suds.  here come the suds.  blub, blub, blub.   now the scrubbers.  oh, love this rt.   look at them go.     oh...  aah. oh. where's.....  oh, no.  the final rinse.  oh.   whoops. i'm gonna keep my window rolled up.   here you go. oh.   thanks.   oh.  ii've got water in my earsmm.  mm. ah.  mm. ahah.   that was fun.   i wish we could do it again right now.  oh. uhhuh.  george wished they could, too.  oh...   and then he realized...  yeah. uhhuh.  ...he had a sprayer, biodegradable soap...  he even had some cars.   oh, yeah, george.  let's make our own "automicated" car wash.  uhhuh.  but where are we going to get a drivethrough building.  hmm...  ah.   aha.  oh, yeah.  if you're making a car wash, picnic benches work just fine.  they make an entrance.   ...an exit...  and lots car washing room in between.    oh, first we have to "spissssh." yeah.   allie: yeah.  okay, turn it on.   if you're washing cars...  whoops.  ...you don't want to wash them away.  ah.    his "spisher" was too strong.  hmm.  maybe if he sprayed straight up, the water would be weaker when it hit the cars.   too weak.  it barely wet the car at all.    but it did knock down a lot of acorns.  jumpy wished he could work that thing.  oh, hiya, mr. squirrel.  did you want to take a shower.   i can't get this water out of my ears.  if you're building a car wash, you need something that lets water in, but not all at once.  ooh.   now the car got wet but didn't wash away.  hey.  yay.   next come the "fwappy" things, right.  oh.  what could make a good fwapper.  ah. uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.   allie: fwap, fwap, fwap.  that's great, george.  now we're ready for the "blub, blub, blub" part.  uhhuh, uhhuh.  aw...  instead of going blub, his soap went blob.  huh.  what he needed was another thing with holes in it to help make suds.  ah. aha.   ah.  uhhuh, uhhuh.   hah.  a tea strainer helped make great suds.   we got the "spishspishspish" and the "fwapfwapfwap" and the "blubblubblub." now we need the "scushscushscush."    i better take a hot shower, put on my slippers, and keep nice and warm.  if you needed scrubbers, bathrooms were great places to look.     wow, that's a lot of scrubbies.    so how do we make 'em scrub.  uh...  where was he going to find something to make the scrubbers spin.  oh, hey, mr. squirrel.  you came back for your shower.   allie: hey.  well, i guess he didn't want a shower after all.   suddenly, an answer spun into sight.  george was ready to take his car wash for a spin.   but the car wash didn't just wash cars...  ...it also washed george.   whoops.  and then he remembered what he forgot.  man: we're on a conveyor.  those rails have rollers under them that carry us through the wash.  hmm...  he needed some rollers...  and rails.  ooh. ah.   oh, good job, george.    but when his rollers were rolling...  whoops.  ...his rails rolled off.   we need one of those long black mat thingies, you know, like they have at the grocery store.  it goes...   huh...  george didn't have a long black mat...  aha.  ...but he did have some short blue ones.  uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.  you ready.  uhhuh.  george & allie: spishspishspish.  george & allie: fwapfwapfwap.  george & allie: blubblubblub.  george & allie: scushscushscushscush.   hey.  a car wash. cool.  oh, this is great.    and my slippers and hat.  hey, the water finally came out of my ears.  huh.  yeah, when i bent down to see your amazing car wash.  it's fantastic.   the automatic car wash was a big hit.  both of them.  take good care of my studebaker, george.   girl:george and allie made machines for the car wash.  we are making machines for something too.  teacher: we are going to be assembling pizzas.  boy:so we're gonna make an assembly line with steps.  girl: we'll make machines that can help us put on each topping: sauce, vegetables, cheese and pepperoni.  we are going to test the steps of our assembly line.  boy: step one, sauce.  kids: aw.  boy: step two, vegetables.  kids: yay.  boy: step three, cheese.   boy: step four, pepperoni.  kids: oh.  the cheese is kind of building up and the pepperoni is rolling down.  girl: we decided to put the pepperoni before the cheese, and that worked a lot better.  boy:you're probably asking the question: why not just do it by hand.  because it's just plain fun to design cool machines.  ..  it's the biggest, and swampiest, wild kratts week ever.  martin:"
