     oh.  george, that was very, very, veryoh.  oh. not good.  oh.  when will you learn caution, george.  forget about "no" and "yes" and "banana." you need to learn the word "caution."  how about the word "lawsuit".   i'm so sorry. here's my contact information.  my insurance company and dry cleaner are on the back.   ooh.  there you go.  yes. one for you too. it'll come out. i promise.  come along, george.  bye.  hmm.  oh.   oh.  okay, george.  i need you to wait here while i get cleaned up.   and pleaseno more surprises.    the time for adventure is over.  huh.  hmm.    oh.   mmm.  oh.   george. huh.   i'll be right there.    ooh.  ooh. hi.  huh.   george.    come down from there.  oh, but he's having so much fun.  yes, but he shouldn't beuh, who are you.  i've come to see a man about a monkey.  let me guess. yellow hat, yellow suit, look of deep distress. huh.  you must be ted, which means that must behello.  hello, george. it's an honor to meet you.  hello.  hal houston from gsa, the global space agency.  and this is my technical assistant, andrew.  hello.  um, hi.  we've had our eye on george for some time.  huh.  look, if we owe you for any damageoh, no, no. nothing like that.  we want george for a very important mission.   oh.  a space mission.   yes, you. hop aboard.   whoa.   yeeha.  did you know the first astronauts were monkeys.   they went boldly where no man has gone before.   they were heroes.  how wouldyou like to be one of them.   so, what is this mission.  i'm glad you asked. andrew.     welcome to majestic central africa.  ahem.  oops.    as i was sayingmajestic central africa.  wow. this is where you came from, george.  ooh.  oh.  lately it's been getting a lot of rain, causing rivers to overflow.  and do you know what that means.  andrew.  oh.  that's right, flooding.    to help control the flooding, we created a device about as big as your hand...  which we call the regional dam synchronizerrds.  we put it in our satellite, and with the satellite  we can control the distribution of water.   we call it project stop flooding.  wow. oh.  the problem is, and this is the embarrassing part, our satellite containing the rds has failed and can't be fixed.  and without itandrew.  huh.  oh, boy.   more flooding.  oh.  yes, george. the flooding is very bad for the animals and the land.  that's why we need a brave monkey...  to go up in space and get that rds, so we can install it...  here in our newground communications tower in africa.  right on the louis leakey dam.  we're not taking a chance on putting it directly in a space satellite again.  why can't you just put another rds in that tower and not go to space.  it's custombuilt. it would take forever to create a new one.  so what do you say, george. can we count on you.   no. no. i meanno.  no kidding, that's a valuable mission, but why not send a human.  the humansize rockets have all been moved to museums, but i tracked down a monkey capsule in mint condition.    thanks for the offer, mr. houston.  but i don't think it's a good idea.    i'm sorry, george.  not everyone loves adventure like we do.  let's go, andrew.  oh. mmhmm.   oh.    hey, wait.  i didn't say "no," exactly.  are you sure this is safe.  why, it's as safe as... flying a kite.    okay, george.  but only if you complete the training without a hitch.    let's get you in training.     let's go.    aw, yeah    well, let's say you're caught up in a bind    well, i've got the perfect guy in mind    he sees things a different way    a stumble here and there, but things are okay    at first glance, you just might have your doubts    but this guy, he always works it out    stays tough and saves the day    'cause giving up ain't in his dna    yeah, he might be a little strange, but he'll help you    yes, he can    yeah, he's only just your ordinary superman     he can help you yes, he can    oh, yes, he can    he's your ordinary superman    he's so cool, you wanna be like him    nonstop and never giving in    headfirst and steelyeyed    when things are down, he's always looking upside    he might take a different route than you    but he's got a different point of view    leaves most folks scratching their heads    if only they would listen to what i said    that he might be a little strange, but he'll help you    yes, he can    yeah, he's only just your ordinary superman     he can help you yes, he can    oh, yes, he can    he's your ordinary superman     he can help you yes, he can    baby, yes, he can    he's your ordinary superman   yeah. yeah.   he's just

majestic centrallet's not. where's george.  last report had george over the lotta watta falls.  we're pretty sure he's within a 500mile radius.  500mile radius.  you mean circumference. i'm pretty sure it's radius.  circumference goes around the circle.  definitely circumference.  hold on. 500 miles of anything is really big.  have you ever found an astronaut before.  we've never lost one before.  but we have five teams out looking.  now you've got six.  ted.  whwhere are you going.  to find my monkey.  circumference. radius.    spices for sale. would you like one, sir.  yeah.    excuse me. i need a pilot and a plane.  no tours today. pilot out sick.   there must besomeone who can fly.  listen, friend. i told you.  we don't have any pilots available.  hey.  oh.  global space agency.  are you an astronaut.  oh, that. it's a long story.  you guys know more about piloting than anyone.  you can take the plane yourself.  no. you don't understandand if you want to get into the air today, you'll need to fly it.  uhflying an airplane. how hard can it be.   it's like a car, except you drive in the air where you can fall andoh, what am i thinking. i can't do this.  that wasn't so hard.  i'm in the air.   and i'm heading for a tree.  oh.   ah.   oh. ah.   ah. )
