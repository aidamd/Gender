when he's asleep.  but no monkey wants to sleep through saturday.   whoo.       this was a saturday that cried out for something special.  you know what this morning's crying out for.  huh.  donuts.  : hold on.  ii have to get dressed.  i can't go out like this.  all right, all right, i'mi'm going.  you don't know impatient until you've been a monkey waiting for a donut.  how about eggs with those donuts. oh...  hey, count the eggs and write down how many we have.  oh... oh...   huh...  uh...  ready. so, how many eggs do we have.  uh...   hmm.  there arenoeggs.  well, why didn't you write "zero".    oh, you don't know.  i thought i was teaching you everything, and i forgotnothing.    george, no time like the present to learn.   you see...  zero alone means no eggs.  none at all.   but zero with other numbers makes them mean a lot more.  see, if we write a zero after one, that's ten.   write another zero, that's a hundred. ah.  that's a thousand.  ten thousand.  hey, nice zeroesyou've got it.  whoa.  morning.   i'll go in here and buy eggs while you get the donuts, okay.   one dozen donuts, please.  we'll meet back home.  and be a good little monkey.    someone on a donut mission can't stop and play.  dogs don't understand.   whoo.      george was really hungry.  but his order only had a measly "1" on it.  huh.  huh.  then he remembered what the man with the yellow hat had told him about zeroes.    woman: george. charkie.  good to see ya.  oh, is that an order for your friend with the yellow hat.  100 dozen.  oh. our biggest order ever.  oh, he must be having a giant donut party.  ooh...     uhoh.  george realized what his zeroes had done.   but try explaining that to a dog.  mmm...  huh.  okay, now, where did i leave that piece of paper.  i misread the order.  it's 1,000 dozen.  oh. this is the biggest day in the entire history of donuts.  we'll have to have more donuts flown in from other towns.   let's see, there's five dozen, ten dozen, 15 d...  hm. my mistake.  it's 100.   this was still more donuts than one little monkey could ever eat.  but george came up with a great idea.  he'd just give them away.  who doesn't want a donut.  mmmm.  ah...  ah.     the train station lady wanted donuts.  hmm.  but it didn't work out.  papers. here you are.  : ah.  free donut with every paper.   before long, those two stacks of boxes were gone.  george had solved the problem.  huh.  or maybe not.  99...  one hundred.  oh, you can't carry it all.  kids. we have a delivery.   george could only think of one solution to a problemthisbig.   so george headed home with one dozen donuts, and everything was perfect.  woman: wait.  i don't have your address.  he must be late.   oh, you took too long to make the donuts there.  : we're sorry.  you're in charge while i'm gone, hundley.   whoa. wait. george realized he couldn't go home, because then those donut people would know where he lived.  woman: woohoo.  we're right behind you.   aah.  so, in the end, george headed home with one dozen donuts.  woman: there's no monkey on that dog.   woman: monkey.  we lost him.       doorman.   george: oh...  hundley saw them outside and barked.  somehow he knew they were looking for you.  he's so smart.  relax, monkey, donuts are here.  whew, everything's okay.  uhoh.  aha.   mm. wow, those smell so good, i'm sorry i didn't ask you to buy more than one dozen.  you look hungry, george.  i'll make eggs, then it's donut time.  it's a little dark in here.  i'll open some curtains.  so, anything exciting happen today, george.  i passed by the d family.  they looked pretty happy.  so, what do you want, scrambled.  how about fried.  hm, i never realized how nicely insulated this handle is.   careful.  hey, wait a minute.  i don't remember buying this car.   did you put that donut there.  oh, what a waste of food.  now we only have 11 to eat.  here's the...  say, where'd they all go.  uh, what.  the hundred dozen donuts.  a hundred doz....  we have one dozen donuts. look.   well, ms. donuts asked me to give you the bill.  wow, what a mistake.  how could they think you bought a hundred dozen do....  what.  how did....  aw.    why, george.    well, at least i know you were paying attention.  we've got to put these donuts in bags or something.   aw, what are we gonna do with them all.   whooha.  so in the end, george got one dozen donuts like he was supposed to.  and the hardworking firefighters thought everything was perfect.  how many left, george.  aah.  kid: george is a monkeythings that you can't do.  kid 2: well, he ate a zero.  kid 3: and he changed the number from 1,000 to 100.  today is 100s day.  we're gonna see 100.  we're gonna hear 100.  who thinks they can jump rope 100 times.  one, two, three...  i marked how tall i think 100 cubes would be.  i think it might go a little shorter.  yeah, he was right.  ..  we are gonna set up 100 wee blocks.  then you knock 'em over.  that's how we're gonna find out what 100 sounds like.  99, 100.   how does 100 feel.  tired.  ...five, six, seven...  narrator: bringing home a new rug is always a oneman, onemonkey job.  so george was happy to have his friend, the man with the yellow hat, around to help.  i'll take the front, george, and you make sure the back doesn't hit anything or drag on the ground.    hold on. we all clear back there.  okay, i'm putting it down.  whew, thanks, george.  boy, i am so happy i got this rug.  george liked the way the big tube looked in the room.   it looked good flat, too.  professor wiseman was rightit's a perfect rug.  oh, i've got to take a picture to show her.  aw, wouldn't you know.  i forgot to buy batteries.  okay, i'll be right back.  be a good little monkey.  ah, what a great rug.   hauling a rug always makes a monkey thirsty for grape juice.  aw.  a lot of grape juice.  the rug made for good toe squishing...   ...so it would probably be fun to jump on.  uhoh.   this wasn't good.  uhoh.  george had to get that juice off the rug.   oh...  now what.  soap.  soap cleans stuff.  so... more soap cleans stuff more.  bubble bath would make it smell good.   that was definitely too much soap.  uhhuh.  okay, perfect.  but there was something missing...   water.   how are you today.  well, i'd like to buy this.  it'll go perfectly with my great, new rug.  wait, wait, these legs...  hmm, yeah, i'm afraid they'd snag my great new rug.  oh, i could fix that.  swap those legs out for ones that are less snaggy.  just take a few minutes, if you don't mind waiting, hmm.  i can't wait to get a picture of that footstool on my new rug.  ah.  did i mention i just got a great new rug.   george had to get all those suds out of the house so he could see if the rug was clean. ah.   whew.  george was happy he spotted the glass of juice.  that could have caused a real mess.   grape juice must help you think, because george suddenly remembered when the renkins' basement flooded.   ah.  that was the answer.  all he needed to do was borrow the renkins' pump.      the watch pigs watched george.  that was their job.   the renkins weren't home.  they were working in the field.  okay, try her again.   or trying to.       george didn't find the farmer, but he found the pump.   this is when good watch pigs go get their farmer.  they needed a gate opener pig.  how could such a little monkey move a big, heavy pump.  george could use a bike to move the pump.     oh...  maybe the wheels should be on the pump and not on the monkey.  oh...      all done.  less snaggy legs.  want me to wrap it.  hmm. you know what.  i like the snaggy legs better.  can you put them back on. sorry.  no problem.  as long as you buy it, i'm thrilled.     tada.    even with wheels, george needed help to pull it all the way back to the house.  the goat sure liked to pull.  he was the perfect choice.  or maybe the pigs would do it.  but, when he opened the gate, they ran to do their watch pig duties and get their farmer.  wasn't there anybody who'd help.  the chicks were willing...  ...but the cow was a lot stronger.     all right. got it.  what is it. something wrong.  you know, i think they're tryin' to tell us something.  they're tryin' to tell us all the pigs are loose. get 'em.    that cow was so good at towing a pump that it went right past her.   before long, he had pumped all the water out of the house.  george, i'm home.  wow. that new rug makes the whole room look cleaner.  george. come see what i...   ...bought.   george.  george knew the room was still a little squishy, but he had the feeling there was something else he forgot.   george.  well, whatever he forgot, he knew he was going to hear about it soon enough.  girl: george ia monkey.  he can do stuff that we can't do.  boy: he got a cow to help him pull something heavy.  girl: look what we did to move a heavy weight.  when i carry it by myself, it's really heavy.  we're gonna give you some materials.  to see if you can make it easier to carry this weight.  let me do it a bunch of times.  yeah, but let's pull... let's try and put this on...  we turned a rope through there and we put the stick through there and we found a way to lift it up more easier.  but now we have a new challenge for youto move that water, but we can't roll it girl: 'cause manuel had an idea to tie a rope around the bottle.   boy: i think the rope got too high on top of the bottle  we did it.  help me out.  here are the eyes.  and i think they go here.  no. no.  oops. no. they go up here.  and below we're going to put the nose.  now, what goes down here on the bottom.  the mouth. the mouth.  right. the mouth.  hey, it's curious george.  and you can play more gameswith him at pbskids.org.  coming up next, explore morewith sid the
