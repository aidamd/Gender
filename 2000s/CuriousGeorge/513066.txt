everything    is so glorious  george.   and everything  everything    is so wonderous  wonderous    there's more to explore    when you open your door    and meet friends like this you just can't miss    whoa    get curious  curious    and that's marvelous  marvelous    and that's your reward    you'll never be bored    if you ask yourself, what is this.    like curious like curious    curious george   oh.  monkeys are natural bornexplorers.  so when the man with the yellowhat decided to visit bunchabeakisland to photograph birds, george decidedto explore with him.  here's the radio, here's the throttle...  and here is the key.   think the key ring is big enough.  easy there.  fun to play with though.   okay. here you go.  careful. that's the only key we have.  really. huh.  aye. there used to be five keys: one for each quint.    the first key fell down a drain.   the second key fell down a drain.  the third key...  fell down a drain.   what happened to the fourth key. yeah.  probably fell down a drain. so...  be very careful with this key.  it's the only one we've got.  don't worry, mr. quint. we'll take good care of it, won't we, george.  uhhuh.  well, what are you waiting for.  shove off.  have fun.  at last, it was timefor exploring.  ahh.  an explorer always keeps an eyeout for interesting things.  huh.  george saw interesting birds, interesting fish...  huh.  and a very interestingwater monkey.      but the most interesting thinggeorge saw was a water lump,and it was following them.  i wonder what that is.    what do you know, george. it's an otter pup.  huh.  huh. the man couldn't be right.  that thing didn't lookanything like a dog.  its paws were like hands.  and its toes were like fingers,only they had webs.  oh. plus, george didn't know any dog...  that could floaton its back.  hey.but it did bark.  maybe it was a dog.    not a pup like a dog.  young otters are also called pups.  oh.  from the looks of him, he's a very young pup.   hi.  he must live around here.  they usually have homes called "dens" along the shore.  huh.  a den.  george didn't see tv's, sofasor any other den furniture.   oh.just a hole.    ah.    otters are very playful and very curious.  almost as curious as a monkey.    i think he likes you.    what do you know. pheucticus ludovicianus.  also known as a rosebreasted grosbeak.  you want to go with me, or stay with your friend.   ah. ah.  oh, all right.  oops. better put this someplace safe.   see you soon.  the man was rightabout the otter.  he was very playful.  ah.  he played peekaboo  hey.   and hideandseek.    the man said the otterwas a pup.   maybe he likedto play fetch too.     ohh.   uhoh.  fortunately, he alsoliked to play catch.    unfortunately, he likedto play keepaway even more.  ahh. ahh.  how would they get home.  and even worse,what would the quints say.   no. no. we can't start our boat.  ohh.  he had to get that key back.  george was a super good swimmer, but the otter was even better.  maybe it had something to dowith those webbed paws.  uhh. ahh. ooh.  ahh. uhh.   also, otters could holdtheir breath for a long, long...  long time.    ahh.   okay, swimming was out.   uhh.  but george had a lot of othertricks up his furry sleeve.  otters might befast in the water, but monkeys were fast on land.  aha.  george just had to get the otterout of the water. but how.  what did otters like.  they liked to play.  they liked to swim.  hmm. uhh.  they liked keys.but why did they like keys.  it's not like otterscould drive a boat.    huh.  maybe they just liked keysbecause they were shiny.  ahh.  aha.  george had the beginningsof a brilliant monkey plan.  hmm.  if otters liked shiny things, then maybe he'd followthe fish to land...  and george could get his key.  he did like shiny things.  this was working betterthan george had hoped.  aha. ohh.  but the otter waspretty fast on land too.  and now,he had george's fish fob.   ohh.  not only were ottersfast in water and on land but they had reallygreat hiding places.    hello.  and then...  george remembered.  he must live around here.  they usually have homes called "dens" along the shore.  maybe that was the otter's home.   oh, no. the otterwas and george was out ofshiny things to lure him out.    his only chance of getting thatkey was to find something elsethe otter might want.  oh. oh.  oh.     and then he rememberedotters like to play.  they played peekaboo,hideandseek,keepaway and chase.  maybe otters would play"trade ya."   the trick to "trade ya"...  was to make your toy looka gajillion trillion times morefun than anyone else's toy.  and georgewas an expert at that.   it was by far the most amazingtoy the otter had ever seen.   the otter hated togive up his shiny key.  but the ball was more fun.   oh, wait till you see the pictures i took.  i got a rosebreasted grosbeak, a piedbilled grebe and a coot.  you ready to go home.  uhhuh.  ah. mr. quint's key. you kept it safe, george.      the otter lovedboth his new toys.  and he didn'tmiss the key at all.  especially since his dadhad four just like it.  bye.  george learned about ottersin their natural habitat, and we are learningabout otters at the zoo.  today we are at stone zoo.   well, these are north america river otters.  the zookeeper is michelle.  he's doing some good digging up there.  they live around rivers and riverbanks.  this exhibit is designedlike this...  because the otter needsa place to run around, swim and dig.  it's healthier,physically and mentally, if you try to recreate their natural habitat.   in their naturalhabitat, they have the challengeof finding food.  enrichment is the way the zoogives the otters a challenge.  which was his ball with washers in it, so it made a clanking noise.  and what that does is itgives them something new.  once upon a time, in a land not so far away.    george was at his last rehearsalfor his very firstcommunity play.  in the playhuh.  george was a castle guard.  ha.  ah.  he really wishedhe were a knight,like steve and betsy.  knights got to ride horsesand had cool helmets.  plus, knights were really brave.  huh.  but the man said: there are no small roles. there are only small monkey actors.  yeah. uhhuh.  oh.  so george kept practicingho. ha.  to make surehe said his line right. ha.  sire, two riders approacheth.  guard.  huh. at last, george's big moment was here.    oh, no. charkie.  huh.  she'll wreck the stage. guard the castle.  it was just like in the play.   ha.  but charkie did not halt.charkie kept right on going.   whoaho.    well, at least the castle's in one piece.   medieval castles had dragons.  we have charkie.  well, we'd better get busy rebuilding the set and the props.  we'll get the flag back.  you guard the stage, george, in case charkie comes back.    george felt awful.  it was his jobto guard the castle, and he'd messed it up.  oh.  what if charkie came backduring the play tonight.  he needed some way to keepcharkie off the stage for good.   but it's hard to thinkif you stayed awake all nightpracticing your one line.  especially ifyour costume was hot.  whew.and the stage lightswere hotter.    what ho.   huh.  that means, "hey, what's up." oh.  a dragon is on the loose.  don't want it getting into the castle...  again.   huh. whoa.   the dragon. it followed us to the castle.   good guard georgehad to stop the dragon.  it would prove his bravery, and the king mightmake him a knight.  ah.    nothing is worsethan dragon breath.  ah.  except maybe dragon slobber.  my banquet. stop her.     wizard, can you no stop the beast. oh.   alas and alack.  my magic hath met its match.   hey, look out.  oh, no.   oh, no.   the king would never makegood guard george a knight now.  how can we have our celebration with that beast destroying the castle.  and thenthe little guard remembered.  dragons weresore afraid of baths.   yeah.  all he had to dowas put a bathtubin front of the castle, and the kingdom would be safe.      hurrah.  but there wasmore than one way...  for a dragonto get into a castle.  oh. is it me, or is it humid in here.      my castle.  she's all broken again.  oh.  if you were going to keepa dragon out of a castle, what you really neededwas a tub that wentall the way around.  is that a bathtub that goes all the way around the castle.  uhhuh.  oh, great idea. where do you get one of those.   if you wanteda bathtub that went all the wayaround the castle, you had to dig it yourself.   but first, you had to make surethe dragon was asleep.   all clear.   well, that should do it.  ah.  thankfully, dragons sleep a lot.   what's this.  oh, it's a bathtub that goes all the way around the castle.  good guard george thought of it.  dragons are afraid of baths. hmm.  i do not like this name "bathtub." i think we should call her... a "moat." oh, yeah. yeah, nice.  uh, how do we get water in there.  ahha. uh.  oh, i got it.  wow. that was some magic trick.  well, geographically speaking, this area is rife with underground springs.  the dragon. she is back.  so what. we got a moat.  but you're on the wrong side.   uh.    oh, no. not again.  careful. watch out.         luckily, dragonscan't climb trees, but they did eat lutes.  the moat had stopped the dragonfrom getting into the castle, but it stopped them too.  and it was getting late.and cold.  if george wantedto be a knig, he had to get everyoneback in the cale.  huh.  george could build a bridge.  but the dragoncould cross the bridge too.  he needed a bridgethat people could cross, but that would disappearwhen dragons showed up.  and thenoh.  good guard georgesaw it.  it was the perfect bridgefor dragons.   hey.  huh.      george.  you okay.  george was better than okay.  hello.  he knew how to keepcharkie offstage.    you're a genius.   what is it.   ha. it's a drawbridge.  to build a drawbridge, you need some wood...  and a way to keepthe wood together.  and a hinge.  so your drawbridgecan fold up.  and some rope.  and a pulley.  so you can raiseand lower your bridge.  ah.  and you have toget rid of your stairs.  that way, knights could enter,but dragons stayed out.   sire, two riders approacheth.    guard. huh.  something was wrong.  this wasn't in the play.  come, come.  huh.  for building a dragonproof drawbridge, i knight thee, sir giorgio.   hurrah.    george had saved the play, protected the castleand become a knight.  and he did it twiceon saturday.   can't get en george figured outhow to make a drawbridge, and we are going to makea paper bridge.  how many pennies can a paper bridge hold.  eleven. sixteen.   can you design a better bridge with one piece of paper.  we folded the paper, and it got stronger.  seventyeight, 79, 80.  yeah.  our design held 80 pennies.  fabulous. nice work.  we turned it into this.  the paper was weak,but then when we folded it,we could make it stronger.  210, 211211. and it fell.  i like learning about engineering...  because it shows people how you can make discoveries.  summersafari august.  george: ah ahh ahh ahhh.  vo: with the premiere of "curious george 3: back to the jungle" tmiyh:
