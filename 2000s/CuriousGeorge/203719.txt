"your highness." what.  you are in the presence of her royal majesty, the princess of bratvia.  so now...  we bow.  wow.  a real princess in our lobby.  and now, we leave.  hey. wait a minute.   you can't walk away with hundley.  oh. we got carried away.  this may be a descendant of the royal dachshund of bratvia.  a royal doggie.  i always knew he was special.   we must adjourn to the royal quarters and complete the test.  only if i come with ya.   you're both more than welcome, especially the fuzzy monkey.   now, we go.  now we have arrived.  welcome to my royal suite.  oh...  george had been in parks smaller than the royal suite.   nice. it's very clean.  now, we do the final test.  the bratvian royal dachshund must weigh exactly one helmet.  hop on, hundley.  he weighs much more than a helmet.  he isnotroyal.   uh... shouldn't we weigh him without the monkey.  oops.   they're the same.  heisroyalty, beyond question.  you're one special dog, hundley.  not hendley.  his name is lord percival barkington the 15th.  percival barkington.     and now, lord percival can take his rightful place in his new home.  george: ooh.  aah.  new home.  you want us to live here.  notyou.  just lord percival.   hundley. without me.  well, he's special.  don't you think he deserves all this.  of course he does.  do you want to live here, boy.   i've never seen him so happy.  how could i stand between him and... all this.  it's meant to be.  you may visit him.  you'll be his...  peasant friend.  well, i gotta get back to my lobby.   tell him i'll be back to visit.  huh. hey.  now, we say goodbye.   narrator: hundley didn't really understand what was going onhe was having too much fun.  do you want to go for a walk.    isn't this fun, lord percival.    the lobby just wasn't the same without hundley.   all that matters is that he's happy.       george had never seen hundley this happy to see him.  percival.  you haven't touched your bratvian beet casserole.  now you eat.  yuck.  ugh.   how could hundley be unhappy.  this was where he belonged.  or was it.   that picture didn't look like hundley to george, but why not.  maybe these measurements needed to be studied by a monkey brain.  that dog was as high as the third boot buckle.  was hundley.    he sure was.  was he really four stripes long.    that guy must've had some strong neck muscles to wear this.   they weighed the same, too.  hundley matched all the measurements.   huh.  george never noticed that mark on hundley before today.   it smelled like jelly.   princess: percival.  are you all right.  there was no time to look for soap.    is something wrong....  fuzzy monkey.  ooh, do i get him, too.  no, your highness.  now he will go.   wait. look.  lord percival's royal birthmark has vanished.  impossible.  that would mean...  both: he's not lord percival after all.  princess: so we made a mistake.  hundley must return to his old life.  you hear that, boy.  don't be too sad, hundley.    well, don't be too happy, either.  please accept our gift of the royal bratvian leek and gravy hoagie.     a dog's lobby was his castle, and, for hundley, even better than a real castle.  child: c one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.  seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.  whoohoo.  yeah, all right.  okay, george, your turn.  you've gotta hit the eight, now.  do it and you set a record.  you've never made it past seven in hopscotch before.  huh.  oh, george, when you reach seven, you just have bad luck.  narrator: george was sure that's what he had.  he had bad luck with pouring...  ...and bathtubboating, too.    george started to wonder if this bad luck would ever end.   huh.    apparently, not anytime soon.  come on, george.  let's get home before we get soaked.  um, let's get you a hat so you don't get too...  wet.  eh.  ooh.  ah.  you like this one.  huh.  aha.  yay.   hey, george, charkie found her ball.  let's get home before it starts again.   huh.  ah.   ooh. hey, that's pretty lucky.  you want to use it in the toy store.    huh.  congratulations.  you're dulson's one millionth customer.  you've just won a shopping spree.  uhhuh. and you can keep all the toys you can grab.  whooha.  in ten seconds.  starting now.  uhoh.  ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four...  three, two, one.  oh, good choice.  she's a beauty.  super fast, even in bubble bath.  and tell you what.  you can keep all the other toys you grabbed.  whooha.  wow, what good luck: the rain stopped, charkie found her ball, you found a coin, then you won all of this.  aha.  the man with the yellow hat was right.  george's bad luck had become good luck.  and it started when he put his new hat on.  i call this extreme hopscotch.   you think you can handle it.  uhhuh.  yeah.  you can go first.   : one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12, 13...  13. george had never counted past 12.  what did 13 look like.  of course.  one comes before two, and two comes before three.   aha.  kids: 13, 14, 15, 16.  seven, six, five...  george played his best game ever.  ...three, two, one.   whew.  then it came time to throw number eight.  uhoh. here's where his bad luck kicks in.  shh. give him a chance.  if there was ever a time george needed his lucky cap, it was now.   whoa. lucky shot.  whoohoo.  kids: three, two, one.  george, you won.   i'll bet you could hop the most ultramegaextreme hopscotch board the world's ever seen.  uhhuh.  i'll have the ultramegaextreme hopscotch board ready on friday.  ultramegaextreme hopscotch.  what does that mean.  it means we're gonna need a lot more chalk.    uh, george...  don't you want to take your cap off.  uhuh, uhuh.  but how can you wash your head.  george planned to wear his cap forever.  he didn't want to give up his good luck for even one second.  are you sure you don't want to take that cap off.  uhuh.  you've been wearing it for days.  i'll just put it in with the wash.  george didn't want any of the good luck to get washed out.  all right. sweet dreams.    oh.  huh..  no lucky cap..   that's where that sandwich went.   george, what happened..   oh, your cap.  i found it on the floor, so i washed it.  here you go.  oh.  huh.  uhoh. it shrunk in the wash.  i must've used hot water.  i'm sorry, george.  i'll get you another one.  george didn't want another cap, not unless it came with a goodluck guarantee.   steve's ultramegaextreme hopscotch game was in one hour.  he had to get his cap to fit.   if george couldn't stretch the cap, there was only one thing left to do.  but no matter how much he washed it, his head just wouldn't shrink the way the cap did.  oh.  how could he hopscotch without his lucky cap.  hey, george. come on down.  everybody's waiting.   okay, george, it's ultraextreme, so when you get to the flower stand you have to stop and smell the tulips, then go under the flower stand.  i'll bet he can't even get through it one time.  as long as he wore his lucky cap, george figured he'd have luck.  kids: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven...   eight, nine...  ten, 11, 12, ..  14, 15, 16, 17, ..   oh.  aha.  kids: ..  five, four, three, two, one.  george made it, thanks to his lucky cap.  : george.   this fell off before you started.  it's a little small.  huh....  he'd hopped steve's most monstrous ultraextreme game of hopscotch without his lucky cap..  that monkey's awesome.  uhhuh.  george didn't need to be lucky to be good.   hey.   it was the perfect size for a dachshund.  hey, hundley, you won a lifetime supply of dog treats.  huh.  yeah, it happened yesterday, but i forgot to tell you.  oh.    hey, lucky catch.  but george knew luck had nothing to do with it.   girl: george is a monkey, so he can do things that you can't do.  he thought he needed a lucky hat to win at hopscotch.  boy: we invented a game.  it's not hopscotch, it's different.  we use dice.  and this is the go back or go forward dice.  we have to get all the way to 30.  kids: four.  girl 2: six forward.  she was on four, and then she went five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.  kids: back six.  girl 2: i don't think anyone's going to get to the end.  look what i found.  with three of these dice we can get big numbers.  girl 2: he got a two, a one and a four.  one, two, ...three, four, five, six, seven.  you got eight forward.  one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.  you're on 15.  i think i'll never get to 30.  girl 2: six, six, five.  forward.  one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.  whew. i did it.  maybe we should call it dicehopscotch.  yeah.  kids: ...11, 12, 13.  for more fun with curious george and his friends, visit your local library and read morecurious george adventures.  or visit
