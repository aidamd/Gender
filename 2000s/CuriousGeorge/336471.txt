uhhuh.    sorry, george, i don't have time for the paper today.  i'm late for my meeting with mr. bloomsberry.  wish me luck.   reason 12: i organized all the pencils in the museum according to size and sharpness.  reason 24: i arranged for the toothbrushes of the british royalty exhibitwell, uh, display case.  whatever.  reason 33: i color coded the color code labels.  sorry i'm late, mr. bloomsberry.  fore.  ooh.     since you announced your retirement, i've been thinking, andand, well, i've put together 50 reasons, 35 subreasons and a handful of compelling arguments why, of all the candidates to replace you, i should...  ted...  you're not one of the candidates.  oh.  oh, thanks for seeing me, sir.  you're the only candidate.  i am.  yes.  i couldn't imagine leaving the bloomsberry museum in the hands of anybody else.  not even junior bloomsberry.  my son.  : oh, heavens, no.  he has other ambitions.   you've earned this, ted.   me, a museum director.  wow.  and all you've got to do is get approved by the board of directors at their annual meeting next week.  the board of directors.   but they're powerful, intimidating men.  whaah.  with mustaches and malepattern baldness.  relax, ted.  they're just as scared of you as you are of them.  really.  absolutely.  no, wait, that's bears.  anyway, just tell the board your vision for the museum.  make them believe in you.  inspire them.  oh...   huh.  oh.  oh, okay.  sure, i... i can do that.   maggie: ted, all of your hard work is finally paying off, and i'm very proud of you.  but... even future museum directors need to take a little time off.  but i've only got one week to put together my whole "priorities for the future" presentation.  most people only talk about the future.  not me.  i put it in a binder.   oh, hi, george.  ooh.   what.   ooh.  you want to see the elephant.  uhhuh.  sorry, george, not today.   i got to pick the colors for my bar graphs.  ooh.  today, i'm thinking earth tones.  um, has anybody seen my bar graphs.  bar graphs.  huh.  hey, mustard's a good color.   ted, all this important stuff isn't the most important stuff.  you need to think about your loved ones.  you mean george.  i think of him all the time.  those aren't toys, george.  see.  just thought of him again.  ted, the people you really care about, andand who care about you, need your attention now...  or there may not be a later.  do you understand.  sure, i understand.  i do.  hey, george.  pack your smile.  we're going to see the elephant.   aha.  see. i totally caught your drift.  we are so in sync.  see you later, maggie.  george: byebye.  hey, you want to come, too.    peculiar.  hello. ah.  tina: ladies and gentlemen, direct your eyes center stage as we present, direct from londonthat's in englandthe great piccadilly.    ah.  oh, thank you, thank you.  i shall endeavor to amuse you with prestidigitation, mesmerization, legerdemain and other large words.   ah, tina, my lovely assistant.  if you would kindly step into the enchanted cabinet.  behold.  the insupposable metamorphosis of woman into water fowl.   ooh.   ted.   and now, for an outstanding wonder hitherto unseen by civilized man.    piccadilly: now, tell me, does anyone here like blowing bubbles.   well, next time, try this.  kayla, the twoton juggling pachyderm.     it's quite extraordinary.  oh....    oh, kayla.  there's no spunk in your trunk.  no pep in your proboscis.  no cause for alarm.  elephants do not forget.  but sometimes they do get stage fright.   now, for the next trick, i require a volunteer from the audience.   ted.  oh. oh, right.  yes, you, sir.  the man with the yellow hat.  uh... me.   please, sir, join us on stage.  oh... gee, iii have a bad case of stage blight.  uh, trite... fright.  obviously.   uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.  go. go on.  it'll be fun.  fun.  : yeah, fun.  okay, okay, don't push.  ii'm good. i'm fine.  heavens.  what a fluorescent chapeau.  may i.  well...  oh, trust me.  ah.  uhhuh.  sir, i'd like you to help me make this elephant vanish.  all you have to do is say the magic words, pachydermatous vamoosicus.  pachydermatous whatsacus.  close enough.   piccadilly: thank you.  thank you.  i'm sure you wish this would work on the motherinlaw.  george. it's just a trick.  no problem.  i'll deal with the cheeky monkey.   oh, boy.   george.  you, come here.       yours.  yeah.  he's a tad curious, that's all.  his name's george.   piccadilly: come out, curious george.  hmm. ah.      thank you.  yes.  ooh.    oh.     ah.    . i want to be the smile .  . i want to see the change .  . i want to be your friend from the start .  . and once it starts it never ends .  . i want to be your pal .  . i want to be around .  . i want to be your friend when you are down .  . i want to be the sunshine on your smiling face .  . i want to be the boat .  . no, i want to be the ocean .  . where all we do is float under the sun .  . on the rolling sea .  . whoa, i want to be the sunshine .  . no, i want to be the moonshine .  . i want to be the nighttime lullaby .  . when you're so afraid .  . and i think i found a way .  . to put a smile on your lonely face .  . i think i found a way .  . all the walls .  george.  . i think i found a way to say .  where are you.  . i think i found a way to say hello .  . i think i found a way to say .   . i think i found a way to say hello .  . i think i found a way .  . without saying anything at all. .      hooha.     piccadilly: kayla....  kayla. kayla.  security.    you think this innocent act of yours is fooling anyone. huh.  you can gofor now.  if you feel like coming clean, contact medanno wolfe, head of security.  well... humph.  woman: hey, uh, boss, i'm no expert, but i can't help but notice that none of these people has an elephantsized bulge underneath their coats.  i suppose, ms. fisisher, you think that's clever.  hmm.  but take away the elephant's water weight, and you're left with 25 pounds of minerals.  you think someone dehydrated the elephant.  a crime stuffer never rules out a possibility.  next.  i suggest no sudden moves.  he's highstrung.  ah, yes.  the man with the mischievous monkey.  not mischievous. just curious.  where is he, anyway.  well, believe it or not, george has gone missing, too.  really.  maggie: itit's not that strange.  he probably wandered off.  he does it all the time.  oh... you know, maybe kayla wandered off with george.  so, that's your story.  your monkey did it.  no. wha....   ticklish.  okay.  you know, iii bet they're just out having fun.  fun.  kidnapping is fun to you.  i suppose murder's just a party, then, huh.   murder.  international espionage just another day at the beach.  no. no. no beach.    listen, yellow man.  i've got my eye on you.  don't leave town.  he never does.   the local police claim a lost elephant is not their problem.  doesn't matter.  i have made it mine.  i will find your hippo.  elephant.  oh. elephant. sorry.   baby elephant alone in the big city.  she must be terrified.    sinatra. mmm...  abba. eh...  ah... tchaikovsky.  hmm.  uh...  hmm.        ah.  : tchaikovsky...      oh...    hmm...      oh...   aah.  and it was here that this nightmare scenario first began.  even the great piccadilly who makes his living causing things to vanish is unable to explain this apparent sleight of hand.  the magician acquired the elephant a few months ago.  kayla is seen here with her brother tonga and sister layla.   just a playful little elephant with no idea of the heartrending drama that lies ahead of her.  the elephant's original home was this animal park in california.   now animal lovers across the country can only wait and wonder what will become of her.    george.  : hi.   george...  when i said no guests over without permission, i am pretty sure that included elephants.  this is hark hanson.  what were you thinking.   peanuts.  yes.  yes, of course.  makes total sense.  well, i better call mr. piccadilly and tell him.     woman: thank you for calling the metropolitan theater.  to continue this call in spanish, press one.  for chinese, pss two.  for klingon, press'cha.   for a schedule of upcoming events, press one.  : oh...  for a map, press two.   you've reached customer service.  finally.  our office hours are weekdays from 10:00 to 6:00.  please call back then.     come on, george.  we've got to take kayla back home.   oh...    if we meet anyone, i'll do the talking.  not sure what i'll say.  any story that begins with "my monkey and i," is trouble.  mr. piccadilly, how does this unexplained, mysterious, neardisastrous turn of events make you feel.  hey, look.  i've been imitated by idiots, pilloried by critics, and walked out on by philistines.  yeah.  picadilly: but stealing a man's elephant.   that's just not done.  kayla is not only the star of my show, she's family.   like an elephant could just walk away and no one would notice.  hanson: tragedy and intrigue. tonight...  : please.  ...a special report on the elephant kidnapping.  george. kayla.  this is hark hanson on the elephant hunt.   george, no.    ooh.    . well, i'm going out west where i belong .  . where the days are short and the nights are long .  . where they walk and i'll walk .  . they twist and i'll twist .  . they shimmy and i'll shimmy .  . they fly and i'll fly .  . well, they're out there having fun .  . in that warm california sun .  . well, i'm going out west, out on the coast .   typical.  my list just says "trunk." who knew there'd be an elephant attached.  well, the boxcar's empty.         george, what are you doing here.    yeah, i know kayla's an elephant.  she has to go home.   and so do we.  i have a big presentation to prepare, and i haven't even begun to alphabetize.    okay, i'm putting my foot down, young monkey.  huh.  all aboard.  so get out of this car right now.  there is no way we're riding a train tonight.  nuhuh.  . they walk and i'll walk .  . yeah, they twist and i'll twist .  no, no, no. wait. wait.  no.  . and i'll shimmy .  . yeah, they fly and i'll fly .  . well, they're out there having fun .  . in the warm california sun .  . yeah, they're out there having fun .  . in the warm california sun .  ted: oh, my gosh.  there are no seatbelts.  : help.  we're trapped.   great.  i've gone from museum director to boxcar hobo.  and look at my priorities.  my poor, beautiful priorities.  does anybody see my pie charts.    never mind, i'll...  i'll just recreate them.    wait.  i have my phone.   no signal.  come on, baby, give me some signal.  papa needs a new pair of bars.  come on, come on, come on.  wait... now there's two.  ah, now there's...  now there's three.   now there's none.    george, you're in my light.   you've seen the moon before.    a bird.  oh. flying.  no, no, the moon isn't flying.   oh...  oh, i see.  well, actually, that's an interesting illusion.  see, the moon is far away and the trees are close.  so we get a parallax effect where it's...    or, sometimes the man in the moon looks down, sees a little monkey he likes, and follows him.  ooh.  i'll let you say "good night" to the moon and go sleep with kayla.   good night, george.   wolfe: come on in. we're all set up.  brilliant.  extraordinary.  impressive array.  do they do anything.  yeah. we've got security tapes, satellite tracking, thermal vision, wire taps fingerprint databases, spectral and dna analysis, and, um...  the theater organ.  this was the only room available on short notice.  but not to worry.  stand back and behold the future of crime stuffing.    uh, you forgot to plug in the future.   oops.    oh, spot on, mr. wolfe.       hey.   huh.      woman: thank you for calling the metropolitan theater.  for spanish, press one.  for chinese, press two.           oh.   d'oh.  oh, kayla, george...  train... right.  wow, the gateway arch.  this is st. louis.  when the train stops, we can yell for someone to let us out.  we're going home.  that was... st. louis.  okay, okay, ii'm not going to freak out.  my cell phone should work here.  but it... has a dead battery.   um, kayla, george, cover your ears.   now i'm freaking out.   ms. fisher, you should hear this.  it came into the call center as chinese.  get a translator.  that's a monkey.  don't be silly.  monkeys don't speak chinese.  electronic voice: beginning voice recognition.  we have a voiceprint match.  it's a monkey.  your powers of observation are dizzying.  oh. dizzying.  i like that.  yes, thank you, ms. fisher.  oh, there's no signal from the phone.  let's review.  why would a chinesespeaking monkey call, then disable the phone.  answer: because he's taunting us.  ms. fisher, this may be the most devious monkey ever.    george.  whawhat are you doing.  this is my presentation to the board.   i have to find a way out of here.   just another inch.   the handle's too far.  i'm sorry i yelled at you.  it's just that these three little rings hold my entire career.  my whole future is all in this little binder.  ooh.  so just be more careful, okay.  . tada. .  whoa, ah...   oh, boy.      i'm okay.  i'm okay.  ii'll catch up with you, george.  promise.      whew.   you've got to stop the california express.  are you talking to me.  yes.  no, sirree, the ce don't stop for nothin', for nobody, no one.  except for fuel in grand junction.  listen, we're talking a genuine emergency here.  my monkey and elephant and all my priorities are trapped in a boxcar headed to california.  but i was bushwhacked, literally, and fell off the train and, and...  and you hit your head, i reckon.  well, yes... but...  oh... never mind...  my cell phone is dead.  i need to make a call.  i'll bet you do.  well, i figure i can charge your phone, but you're going to have to call your monkey outside.  first i'll call piccadilly.  then i'll catch up with the train.  you're saying my elephant was kidnapped by a monkey.  i suppose he wants 20 pounds in unmarked bananas.  don't be fooled.  i can read a criminal face.  that monkey's a lifetime offender.  ms. fisher: probably started off kidnapping squirrels.  that's the gateway animal.  woman: for english, press 99.  oh, come on, i'm running out of change.    pilfered pachyderm unit.  can i help you.  hi.  i have your elephant.  : it's the kidnapper.  beginning trace.  okay, first, i want you to know she's okay.  woman: five seconds.  second...  please deposit two dollars for another minute.  i need more money.  : what do they want.  you need money.  yes, uh, but your elephant is fine, just fine.  ooh.  ...or five dollars for ten minutes.  and i just...  and that includes a subscription topay phone weekly.   i need that money.    aw, nuts.   look, i'll talk fast.  we'll be home soon, and everything is going to be fine.   well, at least i got that covered.  it's a kidnapping, all right.  but that was no monkey.  nobody can fool you, crime stuffer wolfe.  the situation is worse than i thought.  our monkey has an accomplice.  oh, my poor kayla.  i suspect this man.  piccadilly: blimey.  i would never have believed it.  that's because you haven't taken the online crime stuffer correspondence course.  i have.  it's true what they sayyou don't appreciate your elephant till she's gone.  you must get kayla back.  gotcha.  the call came from a pay phone in humbleton, colorado.  ted: no taxi, no bus, no car for rent.  let me see, would you like the bentley or the lamborghini.   don't you have any form of transportation.  just my bike.        ah.  oh.   mmhmm.      huh.     george.  george.   i'm going to go up to the front and get them to stop the train.    oh...  oh, no.   : no...     ah.       no one has ever been happier to see his monkey.   and elephant.  thanks, kayla.   : i missed you, too.   woman: thank you for calling the metropolitan theater.  pick up.  pick up.  ms. fisher: security.  eta, ms. fisher.  ten minutes closer than the last time you asked me.  coffee much, ms. fisher.   oh, hang on.  we're picking up the cell phone signal again, from the same coordinates as the pay phone.  bingo.  i've got 'em cornered.    freeze. whoa.   horse feathers.  look what you did.  what are you doing with that phone.  nothing, now that you made me break it.  i mean, where did you get it.  from some guy.  is this the man.  uh, hard to say.   how 'bout now.  yup, that's him.  strange fella.  he was chasing after the california express.  oh. and where is that train going.  california.  but she does stop in grand junction.  really.  you're always one step ahead of me, but i'm on to you now, and i'm closing in.  mister, are you talking to that picture.  i've got a train to catch.   ted: hey.  she's getting good.   oh. you guys been practicing.  oh, sure, kayla can probably handle one more.  right, kayla.    um... george.    my binder.    say... we're picking up speed.  . taking the long way home .  . we're adventure bound .  no, no, no, no, no.  . racing the great unknown .   . so adventure bound .  oh, boy.  . hold on, here we go .   . adventure bound .  . i know we're close .  . hold on, here we go .  george: ow.  .

 well, what do you know.  14 minutes early.   danno wolfe, security.  where's the elephant.  where's the rest of my train.   i don't know what's worse, blowing my career or having a blister on my toe the size of texas.   okay, rhode island.  come on, guys, stop goofing around.  seriously, if you're not careful...   ...that might happen.  ahha.    you think that's funny.  you could've really gotten hurt.  we should be looking for a road, and instead you're...  george, you found a road.  oh, okay.  a road.  hah. we just catch a ride east, and we are on our way.  okay, this is going to be hard.   or not.   as part of our round the clock elephantnapping special coverage, i am pleased to have the great piccadilly, the traumatized victim.  these past 24 hours have been hard on all of us, though perhaps even more so for you.  um...  your naked suffering on display eh, i...  before a watching, waiting world, while you wonder who's made off with your elephant.  well, i...  i mean, here you are, powerless, while your elephant is in the hands of...  well, who knows.  who knows..  i know.   it's these two.   america is mad.  let's hear you speak out.  what kind of monster would take an elephant..   oh, elephant stealers should go to jail for, like, a million years.  i know ted.  huh.  he's a good man.  there must be some explanation.   you know, despite everything, it'sit's been kind of nice getting away.  still, it'll be good to get back to civcalifornia's best.  avocados.   ted: surfers..  we're in california.     why didn't someone tell me we were going in the wrong direction.  aren't animals supposed to have instincts about this stuff.    welcome back tothe network news with hark hanson.  it's time to hear what the suspected elephantnapper's employer has to say.  i don't understand it.  ted's the most honest man i know.  he once walked three miles to return change to a customer.  waitthat was abraham lincoln.  well, thank you, mr. bloomsberry.   farmer: come

freight company that will ship kayla back home.  the bad news is, they charge by the pound and they can't come until tomorrow.  well, then, it looks like we've got houseguests.    they're having a pretty good time.    ted: whoa.  george: ah.   farmer: that's my girl.   seems like it's your turn, ted.  me. oh, no.  no, jumping into hay from a great height is not my idea of...  whoa. oof.  ooh.
