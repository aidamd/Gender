"the car..." uh, something, something "car..." something "car." oh. this book needs more pictures.  uhhuh.  hey.  narrator: a picture.  this looked like something they'd need.  the part to sit in.   they also needed thatasteering wheel.  just like on the man's car.  and wheels for the car to sit on.  oh.  hey, george, you see how that thingie there is stopping the wheel.  i bet that's a brake.  ah.  narrator: a brake.  maybe this book could show them how to build a car.   oh. yeah.  let's just follow the pictures.  one... two, three... and four.  uhhuh.  let's go look in our barn.  grandpa has all kinds of stuff in there.    ooh.  ah.  oh, yeah, good idea.  let's take the wagon.  maybe we'll find car stuff on the way.  uhhuh, uhhuh.   oops.  wasn't the wagon right here.  yup.  these flowers will look beautiful in that old kayak.  allie: hiya, mrs. quint.  guess what.  george and mewe're building a car so we can race in a race.  all we need are car parts.   well, if you see any car parts lying around, just help yourself.  uhhuh.  aw. must have left my gloves inside.   george: oh.  ha.   narrator: the broken boat and the car body looked a lot alike.  they're almost totally, exactly the same.  andandandand look it.  it already has two seats.  one for you and one for me.  uhhuh.    gee willakers.  what onearthhappened to that kayak.   narrator: george and allie had found a car body.  ah.  narrator: now they just needed steering, wheels and brakes.  if you're building a race car, an old barn is a great place to start.  ooh.   oh, yeah.  narrator: this barn had wheels...  tada.   ...and a steering wheel with a horn.   at last, george and allie were ready to roll.  yay.  unfortunately, their car wasn't.   whoops.  oh.   narrator: george got to thinking.  if you want your car to roll, the wheels had better roll, too.  oh.  ooh.  yeah.  hey.  aha.  we should use the wagon wheels.  uh.    oh, yeah.  we should use the whole wagon.   aha.  the handle is sort of like a steering wheel.    narrator: if you want to ride in a race, maybe your wheels shouldn't ride off without you.  george needed a way to keep the two car parts together.  oh.    he knew just how to do it.  first, he put the steering handle through the hole in the bottom of the boat.  then he nailed the boat to the wagon.    we did it.  narrator: the car was almost ready.  okay, we've got one, two and three, but we still need...  oh.  ...brakes.    oops.  whew.   hey, kids.  aren't you entering the derby race.  itit starts in ten minutes.  oh, no. but we're missing a car part, and we don't know where to find it.  well, i'd offer to help you, but, um...  we know, we know.  no help allowed.  well, if you see anything you need, you're welcome to it.  thanks, grandpa.   george: uhoh.  whoa.  forgot to put on the brake.   hmm.  did he say "brake".  narrator: george and allie had their brake.  well, it looks okay.  we can test it on the way to the race.  uhhuh.     are the racers ready.  on your mark.  get set.  it works.   hey, guys, you made it.   go.   and they're off.   gracious, that's my kayak.  man: and that's my wagon.  go, george.  that's my buggy.  narrator: for a while, george and bill were neck and neck.  come on, faster.   uhoh.    mr. renkins: phew.  and now, let's meet the winner.  farmer renkins' wagon.  it was a rather unusual entry, but it met all the rules.  and our runnersup george and allie...   ...and bill.    child:george is a monkey.  he and allie made their own soapbox derby race car.  girl: curious george made a car that went down a ramp, and so are we.  child: it's a box with a stick through a straw for the axle and some wheels.  go.  girl: gravity is pulling our cars towards the ground down the ramp.  that's how gravity works.  this is how far eli's car went.  my car went even further.  go.  sasha's car didn't go as far as our cars did.  sasha: i am going to give a banana a ride.  zoe: when she gave the banana a ride, her car went off the racetrack.  sasha's car is heavier.  that's why it goes down so fast.  weight and gravity are partners.  narrator: saturday was a daywhen monkeys and men with yellow hats return books and get new ones.  a whole building full of books.  what could be better than that, huh, george.  ah.  are you excited to get a new book, george.   adventurous henryis one of my favorites, too.  maybe you should check it out again.  huh.  it's called renewing a book.  people do it all the time.   george was thrilled...  oh.  ...because the man with the yellow hat...  whoa.  ...had only read the book to him 18 times.  that's strange.  i don't see the librarian.  mrs. dewey. huh.  i'm right here.  hey.  oh, there you are.  sorry for the mess.  my work keeps stacking up.  uh, george would like to renew a book, please.  yeah, uhhuh.    i sure wish i had someone to help out today.   oh.  aha.   man: something tells me george is available.  that's stupendous.  thank you, george.  george, i have some research to do.  uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.  well, then i'll be back in a few hours.  be a good little monkey librarian.    okay, george.  would you mind going through this pile and separating out the dvds.  oh...   narrator: george soon discovered that he was a superfast movie grabber...   ...and a superfast book scanner.   vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom.   ah.   and a superfast pencil sharpener.    male voice : mrs. dewey, please report to the main library immediately.  five book clubs have arrived all at once.  oh, dear.  i'll be back as soon as i can, george.  until then, it looks like you're in charge.  huh.  you're a terrific helper.  ha.  george was in charge of a library.  hmm.  george wondered if he should put the rest of the books away.   that seemed like something a monkeyincharge would do.   oh.  george had put the books away in record time.   this librarian stuff was easy.   doorman: hi, george.  where's the librarian.  ah.  oh, i see.  can you help me find hundley's favorite book.  it's calleddachshunds and dandelions.  ah.  it's a small, yellow book.  it's usually on this shelf.  narrator: a yellow book.  uhhuh, uhhuh.  no problem.  george was very familiar with that color.  aha.   nope, not it.  hmm.   ha, ha, ha.  uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.  nope and nope.    hmm.  there were a lot of yellow books.   huh, huh, huh.  no, no, no.  that's itdachshunds and dandelions.  see.  uhhuh.  thanks, george.  i'll check this out in the main library.  goodbye.   phew...  finding books was hard.  hmm.   but george had an idea.  if books were sorted by color, they'd be much easier to find.   yeah.   ah.  aha.    it took a lot of work, but the library was fixed.  it would be easy for people to find books now.  aha.  where did it go.  hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.  ah, georgio, georgio, you know, i can't find the book.  ah....  yeah. it's gnocchi's favorite book, too.  it's calledmice everywhere.   narrator: hmm, no problem.  george just had to find out what color it was.  ah.  huh.   ah.  um...  ah.  oh, eh...  ah.  nuh...  ah.  uh, uh...  whwh... are you asking me what color the book is.  uhuh.  i don't know.  buti do know one thing: it's very, very, very, very big.  oh...  narrator: big is not a color.  oh. aha.   uh...  no, it's bigger than that.  ah.  uh, no. bigger still.      that's it.  phew.  : oh, thank you, georgio.  you know, i got to get some cookbooks, too, so i'll check this out up front. byebye, little buddy.   : i mean, byebye, little buddy.  bye.  : oh...  eh.  narrator: hmm.  organizing books by color didn't seem to work.  maybe they should be organized by size, instead.  uhhuh. aha.     whew, whew, whew.  narrator: little books...  medium books...  big books...  humongous books.  george had fixed the library... again.  whew.   steve: ah, george, what happened..  the books are all messed up.  huh.  come here, ii'll show you.   this is where all the outer space books are supposed to be.  buinstea you've got...  uh, bunny books.  train books, bug books...  pink pony books.   where are all the outer space books.   ah.  narrator: george tried to explain to steve how he had organized all the books.     did you arrange all the books by size.  uhhuh.  that's amazing.  but i don't think that's the way libraries work.  hah. ohohoh.    see...  outer space books are supposed to go onthisshelf, and books about dinosaurs go onthatshelf, and all the other books...  uh, i don't know where they go.  hmm.  narrator: george wonderedif outer space books all go together, and dinosaur books all go together...  well, then maybe train books go with other train books, no matter what size or color they are.  yeah. train books probably go together.  aha.  hey, i get it.  maybe all the books are organized by subject.  cool.  ah. uh...   yeah, you've got a lot of rearranging to do.  but don't worry, i'll help.     we did it.  the books are back in the right order.  great job, you hairy librarian.    mrs. dewey: i'm back, george.  my. it looks neat as a pin in here.  all the books are back where they should beon the shelves, according to their subject.  uh... right.  well, mostly right.  books are typically arranged by subject, then by author, alphabetically.  oh...  uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.  except storybooks.  they go together by author.  ah. uhhuh.  i'm sure i can put things right in no time.  great.  uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.  sounds like you did a great job, george.  hey, maybe you'd like to help out at the library everysaturday.  hmm...  nuhuh, nuhuh...  narrator: helping mrs. dewey was fun but exhausting.  mrs. dewey: yoohoo. george.  you forgot your book.   on the other hand, only a librarian would give you adventurous henry for another two weeks.  what could be better than that.  chilil boy: george is a monkey.  he didn't know the best way to sort the library books.  my name is deb, and i work here at the building materials resource center.  everything that you see in here was given to us because it was something that somebody didn't need anymore.  deb asked us to sort all this stuff over here.  deb: and it's a little bit like curious george when he was organizing things.  good luck.  i think we can sort them, maybe, by what they are.  i'm sorting the doorknobs.  they're two different shapes.  why did i put two different doorknobs together.  they're both the same color.  you just have to do what you gotta do for the doorknob.  josiah is sorting light switch covers.  i am gonna sort them by shapes.  this one has two circle things.  this one is, like, square.  sorting does help a lot of people.  something you.  it's a week of brand new daniel tiger's neighborhood.  daniel: it's going to be tigertastic.  entire tiger family: hooray.  anncr: peg plus
