ride.  hey, that's mine.   and if i had a minute for every hour that i wasted    i'd be rich in time    i'd be doing fine...   monkey. without you i was broken    but i'd rather be broke down with you

with you by my side...   sir, i'm only passing out flyers, not hugs.  ted, i've been looking for you.  is everything okay.  that's what i was thinking. yeah sure, why.  why. well, you are hugging a man dressed in a monkey costume.  kind of tight, i might add. and, uh...  good luck with that, phil. great to see you again.  yeah, you too.  remember, the sale ends thursday.  so after they took him away i've been wandering the streets.  you saw me hugging a man in a monkey outfit.  that pretty much catches you up.  i can't believe george is gone.  and it's all my fault. yes it is.  what. ted, do you want me to tell you what you want to hear or do you want to hear what you should hear, which i'll tell you, and not just what you think you want to hear.  uh, run that by me one more time.  george is gone.  and i'm afraid it's your fault he's gone.  so the question is, what are you going to do about it.  hmm. hmm.  you're right. it is my fault.  now if you'll excuse me, i have a date with a
