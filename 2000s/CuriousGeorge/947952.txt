what do giraffes eat.  well, let's go talk to amy.  she works here. come on.  hi, guys.  i'm amy the zookeeper, and i'm cutting up food for the giraffe.  oh, it looks like they eat carrots and sweet potatoes.  they do, and they also eat acacia leaves.  did you guys want to feed them.  yeah. yeah. yeah.  all right. let's go.  that sure is a purple tongue.  that's right, and there's a reason for that.  that very shade of purple helps protect their tongue from the sun.  cool. cool. cool.  wow, you never know what you might learn when you explore new places and new things.   this program was

it was a big day at the museum.  a newlydiscovereddinosaur skeleton was going tobe unveiled to the world.  at 5:00, these seats will be filled with the world's foremost scientists and dinosaur experts.  your new dinosaur skeleton is gonna make you famous.  no, the unveiling will be a huge embarrassment.  i'm missing a bone. huh.  as far as george could see,professor wiseman wasn't missingany bones.  oh.  but the skeleton was.   exactly.  i promised them the oldestcomplete ankylosaurus.  but i'm one bone short of a dinosaur.  wasn't that one of the four bones we brought to you last week.  it should have been. but there were only three bones in this box.  one, two, three... and no four.  uhoh.  are you sure you packed all four bones in that box.  um, let me think.  i remember the box was so full,it wouldn't close tightly.  and that mr. quint was visitingfor the fall fishfest.  say "squid." cheese.  but, i... can't say for sure i had four bones in the box.   good idea, george. mr. quint may remember if i packed them all.  ahoy.  i'm not home to take your call.  must be out to sea.  leave a meat the sound of the foghorn.   he's not home.   of course.  mr. quint sent us the photos he took of his trip to visit us.  they might show how many bones i packed.  we'll go check.  hurry. the skeleton must be unveiled at 5:00.   now where did i put those photos quint sent us of his visit.   are you sure those are the ones mr. quint took.  uhhuh.  aha.  all this shows is the box wouldn't close because the bones didn't fit.   the box was closed tightly when we reached the museum.  that means there's less inside.  now where did we lose a bone between here and the museum.  well, to find a lost thing, you should retrace the exact path you took when you lost it.  yeah. uh, i can't remember the exact path we took.  can you.  i remember we made that delivery.  but with all the sightseeing we did with mr. quint, well, it was really a hectic day.  ooh. ahh.  george went through the photosmr.  quint had taken...  of his trip to the city.  he pulled out the ones he tookwhile they delivered the box.  i get it. that's where we started, and that's where we finished.  so, if we put the rest in the order they happened, we can retrace our path and find that bone.  hopefully.  uhhuh.     come on, george. no time to play with hundley.  we started right here, so... where do you think we went next.   okay. we left home, ate soup, bought fruit.  i fell in the lake. we went to the museum.  let's retrace the path.  first stop, pisghetti's.   hey, giorgio.  i got a table for you guys right here.  oh, we're not here to eat.  we're looking for a dinosaur bone and hoped you could help us.   oh. don't you have to dig to find those.   they got experts who do that.  me. i'm just a chef.   no. we're looking for one we lost.  remember we were here last week, and i had a big box.  oh.  no.  ah.  si, certo. that picture helps me remember why i don't remember.  gnocchi was havinga nightmare.  after that, i didn't seeanything but my namewritten inside my hat.      and that is why ihey. there'sa the boxnext to your bag from the market.  huh.  ah.george hadn't noticed the bag.   the market bag means we must have gone to the market before we came here.  aha.  that means we left home, bought fruit, ate soup, i fell in the lake, went to the museum.  let's go, george. thanks for your help, chef.   you're welcome.  whatever just happened. i don't know. i'ma confused.  but happy for you anyway.   oh.  remember, george. we almost lost all the bones here.  uhhuh.  ah.  the delivery guytook the wrong box.    oh. ah.   whew. still four bones.   we know that we went to the restaurant after we left here.  but did we go straight to the restaurant, or did we go to the lake first.  wait. is that a noodle on your cheek.  oh, george. how many times have we practiced wiping your mouth after eating soup.  after eating soup.  you had soup before we went to the park.  that means we went to pisghetti's, then the park.  uhhuh.  ah, we figured out our path.  we left home, bought fruit, ate soup, i fell in the lake, museum.  ooh.   the box is bulging.  we still had all four bones in the park.  uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.  so the bone has to be between the lake and the museum.   yeah.  oh, this looks bad. bad, bad, bad.  is there any chance they'll find that bone before 5:00.  uhuh.  but it must be here if we went right from the park to the museum.   oh.  the pictures had to bein the right order.  didn't they.   ah.  yes. i'm drippy because i fell in the lake.   what is it. i'm wet. then we deliver it and i'm dry.   that's right. i forgot.  we went home again.  uhhuh, uhhuh.  the lobby wasn't justthe first step on their path, it was alsothe nexttolast step.  so we left home, bought fruit, ate soup, i fell in the lake, went home again to get dry, museum.    sure, i remember. you left the box in the lobby while you changed.  then your friend took that picture as you left in the dry clothes.  oh.  george noticed something else.  what was that white blur.  oh.     aha.   george, please, wait a second.  if i explain, maybe he can help find the...  bone.   the bone. hundley, where did you find that.   hundley knewexactly where he found it.  why don't you take a break.  there's a surprise for you on the chair.     hurry. we have one minute to get to the museum.   oh. this is going to be so embarrassing.  ladies and gentlemen, i know what you're all hoping for.   okay. it's done. let's go.  oh.  come on.   george, i'm stuck.  i apologize for what you are about to see.       look.  the oldest complete ankylosaurus, over there.    how can i ever thank you for keeping this from being embarrassing.   george putthe pictures in order...  to help him rememberwhere they went.  we are putting thingsin order too.  my teacher, ms. crapo,put numbers on her board.   no.   what's wrong, friends.  the six is supposed to be in front of the five, and the five is supposed to be behind the six.  friends, is that the right sequence.   yes.  this time, you are all going to get towers of unifix cubes.  we are putting ourselvesin order...  from the smallest towerto the biggest.  one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.  i checked all the numbers to make sure that they were all in the right order.   one cube, two cube, three cube, four cube, five cube, six cube, seven cubei like this project because my classmates and me were learning.   when you're friendswith scientists, you never knowwhen you might be calledfor a "sciencey" mission.  like helping chartundersea volcanoes in hawaii.  and studying the habitsof tropical fish.  now, george had some timeto relax.   george. can you come out and play.  hi. huh.  this was the first timeallie had shown upfor a playdate in a box.   huh.  hi, george.  hi.  but if allie was out here,who or what was in there.  what's in the box.   where'd it come from. is it for you. can we open it.  uh these were allquestions that george had too.  the answers.  where'd that box come from.   it was here when i got here.  no address. no return address.  huh. maybe it fell out of a truck.  there's one sure way to find out.  uhhuh. no, uhgeorge, wait. i didn't mean we should open it.  huh.  we don't know who it's from or if it's for us.  allie's right. it might have fallen off a delivery truck.  aw. you know what.  i'll call the delivery company in town and see if they know anything about it.   lost and found. i'd like to report a package i found in my please hold. oh.  a box that big.  i'll bet whatever's inside is the most awesome thing ever.  it could be anything.  hmm.      huh.  oh.  hi, george, allie. what's in the box.  we don't know.  a mystery, huh.  yeah. we aren't allowed to open it or move it.  all we know is that what's inside is this tall and this wide.   hey, my goat is this tall. maybe it's a goat.  huh. a goat. why would anyone mail a goat.  mmm, mailing an elephant would be too expensive.  they weigh a ton.     hmm.     allie gave george an idea.  if they knew how muchthe box weighed, that would give themanother clueabout what was inside.  twenty pounds.  huh.  what weighs 20 poundsthat could fit in that box.  oh, i know. twenty pounds is what a 20pound goat weighs.  huh. huh.  i'll show you.   allie's right. a 20pound goat weighs 20 pounds.   then again, 20 pounds of anything weighs 20 pounds.  so... it could be anything.  i keep thinking a 20pound goat.  maybe because you've been lookin' at one.  oh.   if onlythere was a place you couldsee every 20pound thing...  that would fitin a box that size.  ah.  then he realized,there was.    it was called a store.  first, they neededan empty box the same sizeas the one at home.  ah. uhhuh.  good thinking. this way we'll know...  if a 20pound thing is too big or too small to fit in the box.  ah.  luckily, the country storehad everything.  pillows were the right size.  but george needed to findsomething heavier.    weights could fit too.   definitely morethan 20 pounds.  george, maybe this is 20 pounds.      it sounded like a bunchof accordions.  take a look.  that gave george an idea.  there was another cluehe could use to tellwhat was in the mystery boxsound.   in the meantime, jumpy hadgrown curious about the box too.  ooh.  a box that bigmight have a lifetime supplyof nuts.   the monkey was back.  okay, george. give her a shake, and let's see what it sounds like.  i can tell you right now, goats don't play the accordion.  hey.   that's another thing goats do. they chew things.  especially boxes.  goats do eat an awful lot, but...  if there were a goat in there, we'd hear it moving around.      it moved. i heard it move.  hello, mister goat. hello.     it was just a squirrel.  he was probably having a playdate with the goat.  go on, george. shake it. let's see what it sounds like.  okay.   sounds like a bunch of cans of soup.  who sends cans of soup.  unless... they put cans of soup in there for the goat to eat.  grownups send weird things.  my aunt once sent me underwear for my birthday.  i'd rather have soup.   george couldfeel something inside the box.  it was another cluewhat it felt like.  whatever it was,it was round... and hard...  and covered in stiff hair.   okay. let me.  she'll just say it feels like a goat.   holy cow. that feels like a goat.  could it be.  told you.    goats were smelly. aha.  but the box smelled like, well, george didn't knowexactly what.  but it didn't smell like goat.    that does not smell like a goat.  mmm.  maybe it had a bath.  grandma always makes me take a bath before i go on a trip.   hmm.  could it bea very clean goat.   look.  it's a delivery truck.   he must be here to pick up the box.   george didn't want tosay goodbye to the box...  until he figured outwhat was inside.  please, don't take it yet.  oh, sorry. i've got my orders.  but, mister, we still haven't figured out what's inside.  yes, we have. it's a goat.  huh.   george, we can't keep it. we don't even know who it's for.  it's for you.  we left it here this morning.  why haven't you opened it.  oh. this was from you.  it's a little present to thank you for helping us with the volcanoes.  yes, i often wonder how other scientists manage without a monkey.   sure. go ahead, george.  george couldn't waitto meet his new goat...  or eat soup,whichever it was.  huh.  no goat.   do you know what those are, george.  uhhuh.  george knew furrybowling balls when he saw them.    no, george. those are coconuts.   so that was coconut water sloshing, not soup.  and this isn't goat hair. it's coconut hair.  gee, you flew all this way just to give us coconuts.  no. much more.  oh. straws.  leis.  shirts. hey, neat.  oh, another box to open, george. what is all this.   a luau in a box.  ah. uhhuh.  we'd have stayed when we dropped the box off earlier, but, uh, we left our ukuleles in our other lab coats.        well, george, we learned an important lesson today.   a box can weigh, feel and sound like a goat.  but if it doesn't smell like a goat, it's probably coconuts.  uhhuh.   george tried to figure outwhat was in the box. was in the box.  we are using our senses toguess what's in some presents.  today is my birthday.  the challenge was to try and figure out what was inside the present.  and we used our senses.   it sounds like there's lots of small things.  i think it's some kind of game. i think it's plastic.  plastic has its own sound.  ah. bowling.  boom.  see, it looks like a book.  but when you feel it, you can kind of feel )
