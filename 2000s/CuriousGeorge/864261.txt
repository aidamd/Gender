"building something".  that gave george an idea.  aha.    you want to trade a jar of sauerkraut for a crate.  ooh, ooh, uhhuh, uhhuh.  ha, you got yourself a deal.   i do love sauerkraut.     aha.  did you make that.  uhhuh, uhhuh.  wow.   i love it.  wait right here.   here you go, george.   george couldn't wait to get his cart back.  heyya, george.    huh.   like my cart.  allie traded it to me for an old backpack.    you want to trade that pony for the cart.  uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.  mmm, no, thanks.  i need this to help me carry stuff to the swap meet.    a swap meet is where lots of people gather in a big space and trade stuff.  you should come.  it's fun.  who knows.  you might find something iwouldswap the cart for.  hmm.  man: "annual swap meet.  "tomorrow only.  one person's junk is another person's treasure."  oh, this is great, george.  i'll bring all the stuff i want to get rid of.  ooh...   oh, no, no, that's the keep pile.  that'sthe getridof pile.  ah.   of course.  you never know when you might need a sombrero.   the next day, george hoped that, between his sticks and the man's stuff, they'd havesomething that bill would trade for.  mm... got it.  aw.  don't need it.  uh... i like your sombrero, though.  oh.   you want to trade the sombrero. sure.     you want the cart.  uhhuh.  it's a deal.  oh, wait.  i just traded it to mr. quint.   don't worry, maybe you can make a trade with mr. quint.   ah.  aha.  tada.  well, that's a dandy fishing reel, but unfortunately, i just swapped the cart with my brother for this singing whale.  :  49 tons of krill on the wall    49 tons of krill...   oh.   george found mr. quint's brother, flint, but flint had traded the cart to his other brother, wint, for a back massager.  oh.   wint had traded the cart to mrs. renkins for some soaponarope...  ah.   ...and mrs. renkins had traded the cart to vicki.   sorry, george, i just traded the cart to some people from the city.   george had worked so hard to get that cart back, and now it was gone for good.   hey.   there's nothing here that i want.  see, i'm an artist.  i work with wood, and what i'm looking for are...  unusual... sticks.   ah.   ah.  well, these are the best sticks i've ever seen.  thank you.  ah...  byebye.  at last, george had a cart.  of course, he no longer had anything to put in it.  but that wouldn't last long.  girl: george is a monkey.  he traded lots of stuff until he got his cart back.  boy: today we are trading.  girl: each kid brought in things to trade for other things.  i have chocolate chip muffins.  do you want one bag of chocolate chip muffins for the giraffe.  no.  girl: matthew offered me three muffins at first, and then i said no.  would you like six chocolate chip muffins.  sure.  boy:then matthew offered six to ann marie, and ann marie took it.  the kids are deciding for themselves what's worth something and what's not.  noah didn't want the truck for a goose and a highlighter, but...  i think the truck is worth more than what he was offering.  boy:trading is good, because you don't use money and you can save your money.  i'll take it.  narrator: when the man with the yellow hat told george he was bringing home a wondrous animal called a chameleon, george decided to surprise it with a gift.   hi, george.   that's terrific.  it looks just like jade.  take a look.  oh.  hi.  hmm.   yeah. professor wiseman and i rescued her when she lost her jungle home.   she's, uh...  there.  see.  huh.  ah.  lookshe's changing color.  ooh.  chameleons can do that.  see, she's usually green, like her jungle surroundings, and that's why we named her jade.  but under the sun's rays, she got warmer, and that made her change color. watch.  chameleons change color when the temperature changes.  george: ooh...   and sometimes when their mood changes, too.  anyway, today jade will get a new home, at the zoo.  that is, if i can convince dr. chroma that she's the kind of rare chameleon he's been looking for.  oh.  yep. ii've already prepared my speech.  now, i just need to pick up some posters.  hey, do you want to feed jade while i'm gone.  uhhuh.  great. her food's on the table.  uh, just drop in a few pieces, and she'll do the rest.  thanks, george. byebye.  bye.   ah... ha.   oh.   jade had an amazing tongue.   george wondered if he could get his tongue to work like that.     huh.  george had left the cage open...  uhoh.   oh, no.  ...and now jade was gone.   yah.    oh.   huh.    hey.   there was no way for george to get to jade.  he'd have to find a way to get jade to come to him.    introducing...   squeaky.  what chameleon could resist.      nothing brought out the puppy in hundley like a squeaky toy.    the squeaks were coming from george's apartment.    george hope that squeaky would lure jade back to her cage.  all he could do now was wait...  : quietly.      ah.  shh.   aah.   george was worried that hundley would scare jade.   speaking of jade, where'd she go.  uhoh.     hundley didn't know a squeaky toy could lick your nose.    ah.  how was george supposed to keep track of a disappearing, colorchanging chameleon.  ah...  huh.  maybe george could keep track by tracking her tracks.  uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.   george thought putting paint all over the floor might be too messy.  he needed something unmessy that would show jade's footprints, so george could follow them.   flour might work.  it was only sort of messy.   hundley didn't know what george was up to.   whatever it was, it wasn't clean.   uhoh.  how was george going to see jade's tracks if their tracks were in the way.     oddly enough, some things work better if you do them backwards.      george and hundley had to step outside for some fresh air.    george's plan had worked.  jade's tracks went...  uhoh.  right out the door.            they found the wagon, but jade was gone.  and now she had a million places to hide.     hi, george.  oh... what... happened... here.  oh, boy.   hey, jade.  well, i don't know where george went, but i have to get you to the zoo.  can't be late for professor chroma.  george knew he couldn't look everywhere for jade.  he needed a plan.  in the apartment, jade had hidden in three places: under the couch, on top of the lamp, and behind the radiator.  they were all places george couldn't reach.  they were also warm places.   huh.  maybe jade liked to be warm.  maybe that's where george should look.    the popcorn popper was warm...   ...but jade wasn't there.  the vegetable barbecue also had heat, but it didn't have jade.  was there a warm place that george had missed.    huh.    huh.      now, all george had to do was put jade back in her cage.  huh.  the cage was gone.   that meant that the man had taken squeaky to the zoo instead of jade.    hey, george.  what's the rush.   uh... sounds exciting.  well, hop on.   meanwhile, the man with the yellow hat had just finished telling the dramatic story of jade's rescue.  and now i would like to examine jade.  if she is the rare chameleon that you say, then, and only then, can she stay.  well, of course.   squeaky.  what was that sound.  what. the squeak.  oh, umhey, let's all go to lunch, huh.  i don't know about you, but i'm starving.  the chameleon please.  show me the chameleon.  uhoh.  uh, okay.   man: george.   let me see.  hmm. mmm. hmm.  well, that'sperhapsyes.  this is the chameleon we've been hoping for.  welcome, jade, to the zoo.   boy: george is a monkey.  he threw flour on the floor so he could follow james' tracks.  i'm lydia from the wildlife passages task force.  animals need a lot of space to look for all the food they need.  and sometimes there are roads that go right through the space they want to go to.  and that can be very dangerous.  boy:we're going to a tunnel made especially for animals to get across the road.  lydia: how can we know if the animals are using the tunnels.  they want to know how many animals were using it, so they put sand, so they could see their footprints.  lydia: does anybody see any tracks here.  it looks to me like it's a fox, because when i look at the fox track, it looks exactly alike.  girl: i think i see the back of the raccoon foot.  girl 2: people should help animals because they're really good for our nature.  wednesday...  that hohum, stuck in the middle day.
