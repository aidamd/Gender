you think you're ready to face the maze at renkins' farm.  uhhuh, uhhuh.  wow, there it is.  that was the maze.   george was going to need a bigger crayon.  welcome, radio listeners, to the amazing maze racethe annual contest to see who can solve farmer renkins' cornfield maze the fastest.  this year, farmer renkins has cut a doozy of a path, with more tintersections and dead ends than ever.  whoever first finds the exit, way over by the barn, wins, don'tcha know.  i see our competitors have received their maps.  let's find out what strategies they'll be ausin'.  oh, we're leaving it all up to tina.  who's tina.  not who, what.  our tiny intelligent navigation aide tina.  uses satellites, sonar and infrared signals.  yeah, in fact, we won't even need our map.  yeah.  where's your partner, sprint.  a partner would just slow me down.  so would reading a map.  i plan to keep running until i find the exit.  i'm keeping track of where i go by dropping kernels of cornor maize as it's known throughout the world.  we're gonna rely on our map.  george is great at paper mazes.  uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.  aw.  don't worry, george, the map is just like the maze on your menu, only a little bigger.  oh.  okay. the only rule is that you cannot cut through the corn stalks.  everybody ready.   on your marks...  get set...  maze.   turn right.   coming through.  ooh.  see.  we are here.  that way has a dead end around the corner.  aw, rats.  dead end.  so we should go this way.   ooh.  excuse me.   female electronic voice: bear left.  oh, this is incredible.  already one team has reached checkpoint one, where they must ring the bell.    tina: continue straight.  yeah.  ah yeah, straight.   on your left.   i know the bell sounded like it's that way, but we are here.  the map says left.   hold on, george.    mr. quint: oh, tough break for the little monkey.  he's hit another dead end, leaving them in last place now.   oh, but team quint has hit checkpoint two.  mr. quint: that has to be a record.  and young bill is acatchin' up.  i've already been there and there, so now i go right.  here we are.  ahha.  you want to ring the bell.   uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.   team george is the last to reach checkpoint one.  i doubt they'll ever catch team quint.  : now turn...  hmm.  just turn.  well, whatever you say, tina.  this doesn't feel right.  see.  here's the bridge.  and the red tractor.  it's all on the map.   narrator: the maze looked a lot more like the map when seen from above.  and now, george could easily see the path to the next bell.    i'm right behind you, george.   team george is back in the race.  but, uhoh, folkslooks like sprint is running in circles.  wait, she's broken free.  no, now she's running in squares.  : can we stop yet, tina.  uh, tina.   i think the battery's dead.   yeah.  see ya.  neptune's knickers.  we have a new leader.  it's young bill.   okay, george, which way now.  hmm.  uhhuh, uhhuh.  uhuh.  uhhuh.   uhoh.  oh, i see.  every direction looks the same, so we can't orient the map.  i guess we're lost.  hmm.  ah.   uhhuh, uhhuh.  oh.  george saw the bridge, the duck pond, even leslie the cow.    but they were all in the wrong place.  until...  george turned the map just right.  now everything lined up.   and george knew exactly where they had to go.   that way.  let's go.   hey, a mallard.  ancestor of all domestic ducks except the muscovy duck.  i wish there was someone to tell that to.  huh.  are we lost again.          gee, i could swear i've been here, but no corn, so i guess not.  you're the one who threw away the map.  what do we do now.  uh, my policeman's intuition says we take that left.  make way.  we'd better run.  uh, yeah.   officer wint quint: wait up there.   at least it's a sunny day for a swim.  yeah, a sunny day.  tina has a solar panel.   tina: why are you sitting in water.  i can't leave you alone for a minute.  say what.  say what.   hey.  no wonder my corn markers aren't here.  they're in the belly of a maizemunching mallard.   cut... cut that out.  stay away.  what a crazy race.  at this point, ladies and gentlemen, anyone could cross the finish line first.  and i'll be there when it happens.  where to next, george.  we're almost to the finish line.     our map.    out of the way, cow.  gee, without a map, what do we do.    follow the cow.   don't you still want to race.    tina: turn left for a shortcut.  i hear them.  they're coming.  it could be all over any second.  tina: continue straight.   no, stop it, cut it out.  why are we chasing a cow, george.  coming through.   this is it.  and the winner is...  a... cow..   a cow.  well, i don't think the cow is a contestant.   no,thisis our winner.  team george.   we won.  but how.   here. i don't need it anymore.   mrs. quint: well, makes us third.  tina : stop. destination reached.  excuse me.  looks like you two win the golden cob.  that's one smart monkey, knowing that leslie can always find the barn at milking time.   very clever, george.   cool trophy.  mr. & mrs. quint: good race.   yes, listeners, it has been quite a day.  has anyone seen my microphone.    hmm...  girl: george is a monkey.  he used a map to find his way through the corn maze.  today, we're gonna make a maze.  girl: we have a map that shows the maze.  one of the kids is gonna be blindfolded, and we're gonna have another kid that's gonna direct the kid that's blindfolded.  boy: our maze starts here.  then we have to take the correct turns and go the right number of steps to get through to the end of the maze.  take three steps forward.  go left.  wait, no, i mean, go right.  i just left and right wrong because i need to move the map so the map is facing where he's facing.  this is the way julio is facing.  turn right.  okay, take...  three steps forward.  i think mazes are fun and tricky.  turn right.  turn left.  girl: you want to put your finger where he's standing, and when he's moving, you want to turn the map with him.  i showed him how to use the map and turn it so that he wouldn't get right and left confused.  turn... right.  take three steps.   oh, my goodness.  girl: the most important thing was to use good words and good directions.  boy: move one big step.      okay, george, time to dry off.  we don't want to be late for the photo shoot at chef pisghetti's.  it's a very special honor to be on the cover ofbird watcher's magazine.   so you have to stay clean as a whistle.  deal.  uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.    hello, fellow birdwatchers.   my monkey is clean and photoready.  where should we pose.  we're going to take pictures out in the park first, and then we'll do the cover photo.  oh, uh, but the park has mud, dirt, and george is so clean and fluffy.  don't you want that picture now.  uhhuh.  the summer tanager nests in the morning, and we don't want to miss a chance to photograph her.  no, no, we mustn't miss.  such a nice bird.  but remember what happened last year when george made the cover.  wiseman & pisghetti: oh, yeah.  pisghetti: ah, yeah.  wiseman: right.   wait, i know.  george can stay here and help steve and betsy in the kitchen.  ooh.    anyone need the help of four extra hands.  whoa, george.  hi, george.     you know, i'm athink to celebrate the summer tanager visiting our park, we color eggs and have a egg hunting contest.  ooh.  man: oh, that

uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.  oh, and georgio, be careful of my heavenly angel food masterpiece.  a delicious dessert i made special to celebrate our daring birdwatching deeds.     oh, your cake and monkey
