that's tara.  she may look a little strange, but that's what all firefighter wear when they go put out a fire.  what's that over her face.   it's a mask.  it stops me from breathing in smoke.  why do you sound so funny.  well, my mask has a speaker on it which makes my voice louder.  so when she needs help, all the other firefighters will hear her, and help is on the way.  speaking of help, i can really use some help taking my gear off.  firefighters are good at helping people.  you never know what you're gonna learn when you explore new places and new things.   this program was made possible

george.   oh...  captioning sponsored by nbc/universal narrator: when you're a little monkey in a big city, it helps to know where yo going.  so steve and george made a map with lots of landmarks.  landmarks are important, because they tell you where you are.  like, this is my house, and this is the dinosaur bush, and here is the statue of the old guy with the beard, the statue of the old guy with the beardandglasses, red rock.  george: uhhuh, uhhuh.   oh. look.  giant ants.   aah. wow.    they're not really giant.   huh.  they just look giant, because they're so close to this teenytiny camera.  see.  ooh... yeah.  hey, where'd you get that.  professor wiseman.  she's coming to get it in an hour.   but i forgoti have dance class.  uh, we can wait for her.  right, george.  uhhuh.  you won't lose it, will you.   like i'd lose it.  i'm not some little kid, betsy.   yeah, right.  well, thanks.   oh.   that is so cool.  hey, watch this.  deep from the heart of darkness, comes something truly terrifying.  hogie, the giant hamster.     oh, no.  my twosided marker.   i can't see it.  i knowlet's get hogie to find it.  huh.  oh, yeah.  okay, hogie, find the marker, boy.  steve: hey.  i've been looking for that.   george couldn't believe all the stuff under aunt margaret's couch.  ah.  stairs.  huh..    what's the matter, george.   steve: hey, that looks like the alley outside.  outside..  outside..  oh, no.  hogie's escaped, and he's got professor wiseman's camera.  steve: bicycle, bicycle, bicycle, bicycle...  phew.  phew.   how am i gonna find a little bitty hamster out there.  hmm.   good thinking.  we can look at the computer, and figure out where hogie is.   steve: yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  looks like he's near the dinosaur bush. see.  it's right here on the map.  george: ah...  okay, we have to split up.  someone has to watch the computer so we know where hogie goes.  we can use my walkietalkies to communicate.   i'll tell you what landmarks i see here, and you can find them on the map and grab hogie.   so, the dino bush is here.   to get to the dino bush the first thing george had to do was turn left down the alley.  but instead of finding a street...  huh.  ...george found a park.  he had done something wrong.  he started at aunt margaret's here.  the park was at the top of the alley.  george wanted to be at the street at the bottom of the alley.  huh.  he'd turned right instead of left.  if you're hurrying on a hamster hunt...  you need a quick way to tell right from left.  hmm.  and then george realized, the walkietalkie ear was left, and the nonwalkietalkie ear was right.  ah...  uhhuh. ah.  he was at the intersection below aunt margaret's.  the dino bush was on the next corner on his left.   walkietalkie ear, left.   if he had turned the way he was supposed to turn, the dino bush would be up ahead.   huh. haha.  and it was.   but... hogie wasn't.    steve : george. george.  hogie's on the move again.  do you see him.  uhuh.  okay. he's standing beside some really big feet.  i think it's a statue.   uhoh.  george was in trouble.  there were two statues.  which one was hogie beside.  one statue is in the park.  that was a long walk for a little hamster.  uhuh.  but the other statue was between the park and the dino bush.  and there it was.  maybe hogie was beside that one.  ooh...   steve: george, you're not gonna believe this, but hogie can ride a bike.  he's riding toward a bunch of trees.   where were trees on the map.   the park was in front of george.  he needed to go straight.   wait. he turned right.  steve : he's passing the bookstore.  right was away from the walkietalkie ear.  okay.  he's turning right again...  and biking past red rock.   red rock was one block in front of george, just to the right of the corner.  so george ran straight, then made a nonwalkietalkie turn right, and wound up exactly where he was supposed to be.   and there was a bicycle.  but it wasn't a hogiesized bike.   uh...  i don't know where he is.   i can't see anything.  aunt margaret's house was down the next street.  maybe hogie had just gone home.   i'm getting a signal again.  oh. hogie is really high up.  he's next to something really big and really orange.    huh.  narrator: george was here, and hogie was at the construction site.  the quickest way was straight up.    aha.      hogie can fly.  huh.    oh.  aha.  phew.  narrator: george had hogie.  hey.  but hogie didn't have the camera.  so who did.       oh...   i lost the world's most incredible hamster.  he can ride a bike and fly.  narrator: george could chase the camera later.  first, he wanted to get hogie home.  and he could get there without a map.   george, hogie landed in the park.      now he's walking.  and he's got a really big tongue.  george, do you copy.  george..  george: uhhuh.  hogie.  i missed you, buddy.  uh, wwait.  if you're here, who's there.  hey, that's our door.  uh, coming, camera.   charkie..   how did you get this.    professor.  i still have your camera for you.   thanks.  oh, my.  well, i've got to run.  wait, professor.  you have to see this.  my hamster can fly.  come on, hogie.  show the professor.  fly, buddy. fly.   steve: uh, we know you can fly.  i don't get it.  kid: george used a map to find hogie.  we are using a map to find clues about a party.  girl: i made a map for my friends to follow.  these stars are where i put clues to help them figure out what my party is about.  oh, think i see the star.  you will have fun getting out of the sun.  that could mean it's, like, indoors.  the next thing we should be looking for is fire hydrant.  oh, yes.  here it is.  spring is in the air.  spring is in the air.  well, that's true, it is.  girl: the last clue was in the purple fence.  you are in for a dirty job.  oh, spring cleaning.  spring cleaning.  oh.  girl: this marks the end.  i see a little tree house.  boy: we think this party is about cleaning out your tree house.  it is. spring cleaning.   narrator: it's hard for a monkey to nap when he's looking forward to the next basil gnoeital mystery.   and george was.  time to get up.   whoa.  hey, did you nap at all.  uhuh.  well, you think you'll be able to stay awake for the big basil gnoeital movie tonight.  uhhuh.  narrator: basil was george's favorite detective.  oh, hey.   narrator: and tonight, pisghetti's was showing a gnoeital movie as part of his monday munch & mystery night.  hey, what movie is on the menu tonight.  the basket of the houndervilles.  uhhuh.  houndervilles.  oh, that sounds like our kind of movie, doesn't it, hundley.   narrator: hundley was partial to dr. onhistoes, basil's extremely neat assistant.    oh.scusi.   huh. say george, do you think you'll be able to solve the case in the movie before basil does.  oh. uhhuh.  narrator: george hoped so.  he wanted to be a great detective and solve a mystery, too.  chef pisghetti: psst.  psst.  my cookbookshe is missing.   oh.  where's the last place you saw it.  here.  you see, i go to hand out the menus, i hear a noise, i come back and poof.  like that, the cookbookshe has vanished.  oh, and without it...  you're... ruined.  nah, but dessert sure is.  i don't know how to make the topping for my blueberry surprise without it.  it has to be around here somewhere.    well, the cookbook doesn't seem to be anywhere here.   narrator: george realized...   ...he had his very own mysterythe case of the missing cookbook.  oh.  the first thing to do was look for clues.  ah.  huh.  narrator: george wished he had his official basil gnoeitall magnifying glass.     oh, what do i do.  keep looking.  i'll start the movie.  maybe you'll find your cookbook before it's over.  narrator: the mystery of the missing cookbook really had george stumped.  ah.  maybe the detective movie would help him learn how to solve his case.     detective gnoeitall, i'm goody tushews.  i've called you because my most precious book has gone missing.  huh. oh.  narrator: george was in luck.  the movie was about a missing book, too.   but he was wishing he'd taken his nap.  missing, eh.      oh.  tippy, come back.   oh, dreadfully sorry.  no matter.  this vase of water will do.  see. the rounded sides combined with the water make things big, just like my magnifying glass.  marvelous.  aha.  narrator: maybe george could use a vase to inspect his own crime scene.  that dr. onhistoes.  no spill got past him.   what do you see, detective.  detective.  man: detective.  we're here.  aha.   you've got your work cut out for you this time, detective needstoknow.  detective george needstoknow wasn't worried.   haha.  with his trusty assistant dr. hundley dachshund by his side, he was certain to solve the case.  it's adetective needstoknow.  he's acome to solvea the mystery, mate.   hahaha.  tell him what happened, chef.  well, i was making my shepherd's pie.  i go to seat my guest.  i hear a noise.  i come back and poof.  like that, my recipeshe's disappeared.  gnocchi, no walking ina the food.  dr. dachshund didn't like a messy crime scene.    but messes might contain clues.   ah.  it smelled like flour and gravy.  huh.  oh, no.  detective needstoknow had left his magnifying glass at home.  aha.  luckily he found something that just might work.    luckily there was plenty of water nearby.  he just had to squeeze a bit to make it round like the vase.  ooh... ah.   now detective needstoknow could look for clues.  huh.  aha.   george: oh, uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.   ah.       this is your man.  i say, how do you do it, sir.  easypeasy, dr. onhistoes.  i just examine the clues.    i guess you should have taken that nap, huh, george.   hey.  george might have missed the movie, but he did get an idea that might help solve his mystery.  hmm.  oh, that's right, the cookbook.  did you find it.  ah, we looked everywhere.  if george's dream was right, he had an idea how to find the cookbook.  he just needed to examine the clues.  um, george, i'm not sure if this is the best time to make water balloons.    if there's one thing a detective can't stand, it's a magnifying glass that leaks.  and there weren't any vases.   aha.   ooh.  hmm.  the rolling pin had rounded sides and was clear.  maybe it would magnify things, too.   he had a magnifying glass that wouldn't break or spill.  what are you....  are you making a magnifying glass like basil.   uhhuh, uhhuh.  oh.  hey, look at these prints.  those might be gnocchi's.     oh, look at that.  gnocchi's tongue is blue.  she must have eaten the blueberries.  uhhuh.  ah, aha.  yeah, look at that.  there's blueberries spilled all over the countertop.  huh.   aha.  george had it.     he never does this at home.  ha.  my recipe book.   gnocchi, you must have knocked it into my blueberry surprise when you were sneaking blueberries, huh.  thank you, detective georgio.  you are the greatest detective ever.  haha.  ah.    hmm.   boy: george solved the myster boy: george solved the mystery by looking closely at gnocchi's paw prints.  we are trying to solve our own mystery.  how could we identify who made this fish.  girl: the kids who made this fish didn't put the names on them.  and the fish were decorated with each kid's fingerprints.  do we all have the same fingerprints.  children: no.  child:officer casey and officer kate came in to help.  maybe we'll have to take your fingerprints )
