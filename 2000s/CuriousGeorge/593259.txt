pants's guitar isn't all shiny like the pretty bluegrass one.  oh.  allie was right. the guitardidn't glimmer or shine.  act, it was dusty.    oh, i know. let's give it a bath.  grandma says there's nothing like a bath to make you bright and shiny.  yeah.   george couldn'twait to see the man's guitarall bright and shiny.  ooh. uhoh.  but instead, the bathmade it lumpy and peely.  oh.  george needed another guitarfor the man to playat the hoedown, and fast.  and then, he remembered.  anyone can make a guitar. you just need the right parts.  aha.george would make a new one.   great idea, george.  we'll make a new and improved guitar.  yeah.  first, they needed some kindof box with a hole in it.  they found lots of boxes.  but some of them were flimsy.  and none of them had holes.  hmm.  the one that was sturdyanddidhave a hole...  wasn't really a box at all.  hmph.  ahh.  ah.  aha.  hey.    george's homemade guitarwas finally taking flight.  you found a box with a hole. what's next.   oh, a long wood thingy to put strings on.  got it.  ah. butthe wood thingies they found...  were too skinny.  or too rippy.   whoa.    yeah.  aha.  george's guitar lookedalmost like the man's guitar.  huh.  except for those bumps.  nothing some chopstickswouldn't fix.  now, george just had to waitfor the bumps to dry.  i found some guitar strings.  yeah.  there were shoestrings,a yoyo string, some fishingline, a picture wire...  and rubber band.  george couldn't decidewhich of allie's strings to use.  so he decidedto use them all. hmm.  ahh.   uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.  he was almost done.   oh, no, george.  the hoedown starts in half an hour. we need to hurry.  uhoh. how do we attach the strings to the top.  these strings were attachedto something that turned.  if only george could findsomething like that.  ah. hey.  aha. oh, yeah.    that's good, george. turning it tightens the string.  george's guitar looked great.and it even had lights.   play it, george.     huh. oops.  george's guitar looked great,but sounded awful.  now the man would neverbe able to play at the hoedown.    hey, gang.  hi.  george, did you find my guitar.  jerry and i wanted to...  practice.  yeah. i don't think you'll be playin' with this.  well, it was nice of you to... clean it for me.  uhyou're welcome.  but don't worry, mr. yellow pants. you can still play.  george made you a new guitar. show him, george.   this is great. huh.  bluegrass has a fine tradition of using handmade instruments of all kinds.  washboards, spoonsbut thisthis is the only shoestringfishing lineyoyo, picture wiretennis racket, birdhouserubber "bandolin."  hey, i think i've got the lyrics for your song.     let me tell y'all a story 'bout a monkey    he built an instrument to play    with a birdhouse, racket and a mess of strings    that boy was strummin' every day    he had a monkeybuilt birdhouse bandolin    it was the strangestpickin' thing that's ever been    it had a shoestring, fishing line, rubber band and yoyo    that monkey birdhouse bandolin   yeehaw.  let's go.  mmhmm.  whoohoo.   well, you don't need to take no music lessons    you don't even need a tune at all    a birdhouse bandolin's a cinch to play    just pick away and have a ball    he had a monkeybuilt birdhouse bandolin    it was the strangestpickin' thing that's ever been    it had a shoestring, fishing line, rubber band and yoyo    that monkey birdhouse bandolin    he had a monkeybuilt birdhouse bandolin    it was the strangestpickin' thing that's ever been    it had a shoestring, fishing line, rubber band and yoyo      that monkey birdhouse bandolin   yeah.   that monkey birdhouse bandolin    that monkey birdhouse bandolin   yeehaw.    george and allie made a guitar.  and we are makingsome string instruments too.  you're going to be making an instrument that can play different pitches.  to do this, you're going to have a lot of different containers.  and for strings, you'll have a choice of rubber bands.  a pitch could be a very high pitch or it could be very lowpitched.   so, when they're tight,they have a higherpitchedsound...  because they vibrate faster.  vibration is the quickbackandforth movement.  and if they're loosethen there's a lower sound,means it vibrates much slower.   in music, you canexpress whatever you wantinto different instruments.  that's why i, milo, am asking youtry making your own.       oh, i have to tell you, george. i am pretty excited.  i've never been to a clown school before.   oh, just think.  we get to see pepe el loco, the world's greatest clown performer.  yeah. uhhuh.  okay, here we are.  ooh.  just have to find a parking space.  oh, look. there's one right in front.   aw. ah, it's okay. there's still room for us.  wow. pepe el loco is popular.  why don't you go in and save some seats for us while i park the car.  the show is on the ninth floor.   ah.        this was the best school ever.   and that was the funniestmessenger ever.   oh.the elevator leftwithout him.   george decidedhe should take the stairs.  uhoh.the messenger clowndropped his bag.  and his hat and nose.  maybe the messenger clownwas going topepe el loco's show too.  george could give themback to him.  yes.  huh.  sorry.   hmm. the stairwell doorsdidn't have numbers.  but george could stillfind the ninth floor,because george could count.  one.  two.  three.   uhoh.  george had forgottenwhat number he was on.  hmm.maybe someone insidecould help.   a messenger.  thank goodness you're here.  why aren't you in uniform.   company

faster.  uhhuh.  your next pickup is on four.  uhhuh.  george sure wishedhe had a way to tellwhat floor he was on...  without havingto start at one.  hmm.  elevators had signs thattold you what number came next, even if you were somewherein the middle.   ahh.  george could make a sign too.    certainly.   i'm never gonna find a parking spot.  wow, thanks.  now, i just have to go to the ninth floor, which...  is a long, long way away.   usinghis numbered fingers, all georgehad to do was count down...  from floor eightto floor four.  ahh.   ah.  seven.  six.  five.  four.  at least, he hoped it
