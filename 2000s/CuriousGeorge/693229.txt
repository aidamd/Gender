nbc/universal narrator: it was a good day for bouncing balls.    huh.    ooh.  if one bouncing ball was fun, george could hardly imagine how much fun he'd have with that many.   welcome to the launch of the new megabouncing funball.     ah.  oh.  narrator: george wondered how far a megabouncing ball could megabounce.  ah.  gotcha.  this is the first funball contest ever anywhere.  and whoever comes closest to guessing the number of funballs in this rocket gets to keep them all.  all: oh.  and the rocket, too.   now, your entries have to be in the guess box by 5:00 today.  don't bother entering, 'cause i'm gonna win.    oh, really.  i've got a surefire secret numberfiguring formula.   you'll see.  charkie.  hmm...  hmm...  this calls for some math.  good luck.  may the best girl win.   or monkey.   narror: if one bouncing ball was fun, george could hardly imagine how much fun he'd have with that many.  george just had to win.  if he had his own funball machine, he could count how many balls fit inside it and win for sure.  hey.  narrator: maybe he didn't need a whole machine.  just something the same shape and size as the part that held the funballs.   uhhuh.  now he had to find a container this size and shape.  he didn't have one round container in his closet.   i want to practice my swing.  have you seen my golf balls, george.  uhuh.  ah.  george remembered they had a hatbox that was just the right shape.   huh... huh... huh...  huh... huh.  aha.  a box this shape and size should hold about the same number of balls as the funball machine.   that machine held more funballs than this...  oh...  because these were too big.  george needed smaller round things to fill the box.  found 'em.  but i can't practice now.  i got to go pick up our fruit and veggies at the grocery store.  oh.  some fruit was smaller and round.   you'll pick them up.  uhhuh.  well, great, george. thanks.  i'll be at the park.  hi, george.  picking up that order.  uhhuh.  round enough, but too big.  ah.   big grapes were almost the same shape as a funball.  ah.  ah.  hey.  uhoh.  its hard to count grapes when they taste so good.  george needed more big grapes.   uhoh.  oh, sorry, george.  steve just bought the last of my grapes.   you'd better hurry if you want to win that contest, george.  oh, i forgot. i'm gonna win.   charkie.  oh.  george needed a whole new way to measure if he wanted to come up with a good guess before it was too late.   george, i just put in the winning guess, so come back at 5:00 to see me claim the prize, okay.  aw...  now i've gotta go find charkie.  here, catch.  hmm.  grapes were smaller than funballs.  that would've been a bad guess.  so eating the grapes was a good thing.  hmm.  to make a good guess, george had to find bigger round things to count.   hi, george.  i'm heading to the thrift shop to donate these things, so someone else can enjoy them.  ah.  ah, my old marble collection.  well, i've got cat'seyes, agates, some big kongsized ones, too.  ah.  these big marbles were the closest yet to funball size.  oh, you want them.  well, be my guest, george.    george, did you enter the contest yet.  only half an hour left.    thanks for breaking my fall.  were you using marbles to figure out your guess for the contest.  uhhuh.  that's a pretty good idea, george.  i estimated a funball to be almost as big as a golf ball.   i need to fill this with golf balls to help me guess.  where do i get that many golf balls.     oh, hi.  hi.  may we borrow these golf balls.  we're trying to win a contest by 5:00.  sure. but you'd better hurry.  thanks.  if we win the contest, we'll split the prize, george.  uhhuh. uhhuh.  this cookie holder is about onethird the size of the funball machine's container.  so how many balls would be in three containers.  120.  that's our number.   well, let's go.  it's almost 5:00.     after i win, i'm going to throw a funball party.  maybe i'll even invite you two.     i found charkie.  dingdingding.  we have a winner.  george and betsy came the closest with 120 balls.  all right, george.  i don't get it.  i divided red balls by green balls, and multiplied by orange ones.  what went wrong.  aha.  so, george and betsy, how are you going to split the prize.   uhhuh.   that was sure nice of you two to give everyone a funball.  wow. this is even more fun than all the marbles i found in the street.   so, george, what are you going to do with the funball machine.  hmm.  you two can be my golf partners anytime.   child: george is a monkey.  he tried to guess the number of funballs by using golf balls.  well, we don't use that word "guess" in this classroom.  what word do we use.  estimate.  estimating means you get some information and try and figure out the number.  teacher: this container holds 17 unifix cubes.  child: some kids are estimating how many of the same size cubes are in a bigger container.  girl: we are gonna measure the macaroni up to this.  one, two, three, four.  four of these containers equal this big container, so that would be four containers with 17 cubes in each.  teacher: what number did we get.  boy: we're counting to get the correct number of cubes.  74, 75.  child: our estimate was 68, and our actual one is 75.  it was kind of close.  child 2: other kids are estimating how many smaller cubes are in the same container.  we figured out that there are eight of these small cubes inside this big cube.  we already knew that there are 17 in this box, and so, i added up 17 eights.  136.  child: now we will count the actual number.  159.  teacher: so, 136 to 159... i think these estimates were really, really good.     narrator: george loved playing outdoors, but lately, the weather wasn't cooperating.    when he wanted to play ball...   huh.  ...it was too windy.   when he wanted to fly a kite...   ...it rained.    hi, george.   and when he wanted to splash in puddles...  huh.  ...it didn't rain enough.   there we go.  george was tired of the weather messing up his fun.   tomorrow, he was going to be ready for anything.   huh.       george, are you all right.  uhhuh.   gee, it looks like you're ready for any weather from snow to sunshine.  everything but fog.      i've heard that some animals can instinctively predict the weather.  i guess you're not one of them.  uhuh.   if george could become an animal who could predict the weather, it sure would make his life easier.    do you like it.  i call it "red sky at night, sailor's delight." huh.  oh, there's no sailor.  it's just a saying.  sailors learned from watching the sky that if there's a bright red sunset, the next day is usually nice.  ah.   hmm.  if sailors could predict the weather from watching the sky, maybe a little monkey could, too.  so george decided to draw pictures of all the weather he saw, starting with the red sunset...  and then, the warm sunny day.      and he added that he met a cricket.   the next morning, george drew the dark clouds that filled the sky.   he also drew the cricket again, but drew fewer noise lines, because the cricket had less to say on this chilly morning.  when it rained in the afternoon, george drew that.  hmm.  so clouds meant rain.  these were turning into very useful drawings.  the next day, the clouds looked very different.  hey, george, it looks like a great day.  want to go to the park and have a picnic.    george loved picnics...   ...but he didn't want to get caught in the rain again.   and clouds meant rain.  but i thought that...   okay, we can eat here.  uhhuh.   all done, george.  uhhuh.  boy, what a great day, huh.   but there were clouds.  it should have been raining.  unless...  maybe only dark clouds made rain.  little white clouds didn't.   george had canceled a fun picnic for no reason.    early the next morning, the clouds overhead were white.   so, now he could have that picnic.   oh...  george, where are you going.     huh.       the wind that blew the leaves must have moved the clouds, too.  george definitely needed to study wind.  ah.  aflag showed which way the wind was blowing.  but george didn't own a flag.  aw...  ah.  he did, however, know someone who owned socks.  aha.    uhhuh.  now, he'd always know which way the wind was blowing clouds.  but how fast were they moving.  hmm...  aha.   the cricket's noise was fast again.  it always had more to say when the weather was warm.  george, dinner.  hey, is that one of my socks.  uhhuh.    : i guess it's a windsock now.  uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.   that's right.  and the harder the wind blows, the faster the pinwheel turns.  you are turning into a regular weather monkey.   say, tomorrow, would you like to visit the einstein/pizza weather station.  they have lots of cool stuff that helps predict weather.   this is it.  the most modern weather equipment in the world.  how could they forecast weather here.  they didn't have socks or pinwheels or crayons not even a cricket.  radar tells us where it's raining, and satellites show us earth from space, so we know where all the clouds are.  ooh.  then this computer tells us what the weather will be.  or it would...  except that's yesterday's picture.  we can't find our satellite.  you lost your satellite.  well, space is very big.  and now the mayor is coming by to see if he can play golf today.  he hates getting caught in the rain.   so did monkeys.  without satellite data, our computer can't forecast.  it's just absolutely hopeless.  hmm...  ah.  aha.  where is he going so monkey fast.  i think he wants to predict the weather for you.    there were storm clouds in the horizon...  aw...  but the wind was blowing them away. )
