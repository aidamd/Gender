"closed for chinese new year." this is terrible.  now we'll never get the stain out.  actually, the stain is gone.  it is.  yeah. so is the nose.   oh, no.  hey.  it turned outdogs like plum sauce...  and dragon noses.  after that dog.  and playing chase.      now it'sreallyruined.  george had an idea.  he'd brokena few things before too.   george.  george.   george.  okay, he'd broken lotsof things.  and that's why he hadlots of art supplies at home.   aha.  huh.  uh, it's kinda close, george, but it has to look the same as the old nose.  why. it's important. it's a tradition.  oh. oh.  george remembered the old nosehad red and gold stripes...  and it was curvy.  he didn't haveanything like that, so he'd have to makethe new noseaha.  out of red and gold yarn.  uhhuh.  good try, george, but that nose is a little too droopy.  the trick was to findthe right material.  ah.  oh.  felt wouldn't do the job.  and neither would ribbon.  oh.  aha.  pipe cleaners. great idea, george.  they're strongandbendy.  aha.  perfect.  but the rest of the dragon head covered in red cloth.  we need red cloth to cover the new nose.  and fast.  the napkins were perfect.  and a little while later, the nosewas as good as new.  the dragon looks wonderful.  oh, but it's too late.  the parade has already started.  wait. you said the paradeends with the dragon dance.  yeah, but it's so late i'm not even sure we can make it before it ends.  are you kidding. we'll take a shortcut through the park.  with all the practice we've had, we're dragon masters now.  yeah. uhhuh.  okay, let's try.  so they were like a dragon.  it's nice and wideopen here. nothing to watch out for.  they kepttheir eyes forward.  aah. tree.  oh. oh. oh, no. they stayed in a line whoa. haha.  and kept an even distance.  all right. we did it.     lily, it's that dog again.  run. be like a dragon.    whwhwhoa.   excuse me.  rex.  thank goodness.  that dragon could have hurt my little baby.  by the time they reachedthe other end of the park, the threewere dragon masters.  we did it. great "dragoning," guys.  you're an awesome tummy and tail.  ah.  igracias.     ah, where did she go.  hey, dad. lily.  where have you been.  never mind. i have some bad news.  your cousins are still stuck in traffic.  there's no one to help you be the dragon.  i'm sorry.  hang on. i know a couple of experts.  yeah. yes.      and that's how, with a little practiceand the right materials, a monkey became a dragon.   george made a new nosefor the dragon.  we are makinga whole dragon.   we're going to use our boxes today...  to make our own dragon.   we experimentedwith different materialsto connect the boxes.  we're using pipe cleaners.  the pipe cleaners can wiggle.  so i poked holes here, and i put these things in so it can go diagonal.  we have to test.  how can we makeyour joint move...  boththiswayandthisway.  let's put a brass fastener right here.  we had to move it in two directionslike thatandlike that.  success.   our dragon is working great.      yeah.  today was bowling day, and george wanted to bowla superhigh score.  yay.  i wish you wouldn't bowl with breakfast.  aw.   the man had organizeda bowling tournament...  to buy a nesting groundfor the bobolink birds...  and found a big donorin mr. glass.  the more pinspeople knocked down, the more money would bedonated for bobolinks.  so the childrenwere having a practice gamebefore the tournament...  to get betterat knocking down pins.   you see.  now you can practice with something that doesn't squish or squirt.  oh, good. you're here.  we have to cancel the tournament.  huh. cancel the tournament.  we have an emergency.  normally i rack the children's bowling balls...  and mr. berg polishes the shoes.  but mrs. berg's back has been acting up, so we switched.  and now mr. berg's fingers are stuck.  ah.  i have to drive him to the doctor's.  on account of i can't steer with bowling ball hands.  ow. oof.  there'll be no one to hand out shoes or work the concession stand.  we can do it.  we keep all the shoes over here. ohh.   oh, let's get you to the doctor before you do any more damage.  don't worry.  we'll have things back to normal in no time.   andwhew.  ah.  do you think you can handle the shoes, george. uhhuh. uhhuh.  i'll go get the popcorn started.  mr. berg sure hada lot of shoes.  luckily, george hada lot of hands.    tada.  all the shoes wereback in the cubbies.  ah.  hiya, george.  hello.  and just in time.  the children's practice roundwas about to start.  this is my first time bowling, but i know i'm gonna be good at it.  my grandma always tells me how good i am at knocking things down around the house.   uhhuh.  me and my team need shoes.   ah. thanks, george.  aw.  handing out shoes was easy.  hey there.  popcorn. ooh.  is this a new flavor.  it is if you like it.  let's make another batch.  where does mrs. berg keep her popcorn.  um, i don't know.  hey, wanna watch me get my first strike ever.  uhhuh. okay.  here i go.  hey.  ohh. oops.  next time.   huh.  something was wrongwith allie's shoes.  in fact,something was wrongwithallthe shoes.  the shoes wouldn't stayon anyone's feet.  this was awful.    george had tofigure out what was wrongwith the shoes, and quick.    hey, george.  the sprout bowlers reporting for duty.  huh.  wow. good thing they gave the little kids extra time to practice.   yup. that shoe is too big for a kid.  most bowlers wear the same size bowling shoes as their street shoes.  little kids probably don't know that.  monkeys didn'tknow that either.  but then monkeysdidn't usually wear shoes.  size 10, size 10.  and size 7. ah.   you're right, george. the size is written on the back.  good eye.  they could findthe shoes quicker...  if the size numberswere in order.   simple.  i bet everyone will bowl a lot better now that they've got the right shoes.  i got one. i got one.   whoa. whoa.  i'll get it. ow.  this shoe is really small.  maybe my left foot had a growth spurt.     i thought i heard a bowling ball in the snack stand.   maybe it was just thunder.  oh. i found the popcorn.  something was still wrongwith the shoes.  huh.  lucy and charlie's shoeswere all size 10's, both janice's shoeswere size 6's, and phil's shoeswere both 9's.  so why did theyfit differently.  the 9's were writtenin different colors.  why did mr. berg'sshoe numbers...  come in so manydifferent colors.  ah.  huh.hey.  george hadn't noticedthese colored signs before.  there was a blue man,a red ladyand green children.  they were the same colorsas the shoes.  huh.  maybe the different colorsmeant that they weredifferent kinds of shoes.   ah.  hmm.  the shoewith the number in greenwas the smallest.  ah. green numbers must be for children.   the show with the red numberwas a little bigger.  hmm. red numbers must be for ladies.  aha.  the shoes with blue numbersre the bgest of all.  uhah.  blue numbersmust be for men.  when you matchthe numbers and the colors, you've got two shoesthat were the exact same size.   oh. hey.   oh.  ow, ow, ow, ow.    george, what are you the different colors mean they're different kinds of shoes.   how'd you ever figure that out.  you're pretty smart for a city kid.     my right shoe is too small, and it won't let me walk straight.  huh.  jimmy already has two shoes with the same color number.  so what's wrong with his right shoe.  hmm.  george couldn't figure outwhat was wrong.  the shoeswere exactly alike.  couldthatbe the problem.   jimmy was wearingtwo left shoes.  i've got two left shoes.  how did i not notice that.   huh.    thanks, george.  ah.  george had finallysorted the shoes perfectly.  yes.  you ready, george.  uhhuh.  he even foundthe right size for himself.  yeah.   way to go, george.  everyone scored big points.  the fundraiserwas a huge success.  and the bobolinksgot their nesting ground.   george organizedthe bowling shoes.s.  we are organizingcollections of things.  we brought collections of shells, and we sorted them into different categories.  this one's going to be sea glass.  this one's going to be ones with holes.  i set up the category of "oddballs." then i thought it wasn't very creative.  so i thought of doing patterns.  all these shells have all different kinds of patterns.  like this one is brown, white, brown, white, )
