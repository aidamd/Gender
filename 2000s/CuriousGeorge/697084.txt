curious...curious george.   oh...  captioning sponsored byuniversal animation narrator: it was a perfect day to just walk down the street smelling.   so that's what george did.   : ah...   george's nose took him to all the best smells.  ah...   then...  he reached monkey nose heaven.  hello, george.  it smells better back here, you know.  ooh.  george couldn't believe all those different, plainsmelling things could become an amazing donut.    george was wondering what kind of magic  donut makers knew...  when his ears got in the way of his nose.  george's friend gnocchi was locked in combat with her archenemy, the extra large, cutesie bow.   george didn't understand tabby, but he listened politely.  ooh...   gnocchi was thrilled ah.  to be free from looking cute.  george was officially a cat hero.   george almost forgot he was smelling today.  then...  chef pisghetti's kitchen grabbed his nose.  chef pisghetti's kitchen was like a... a nose circus. ooh...  gnocchi.  il mio gatto dolce.  you've lost your pretty ribbon.   there.  now...  she's acute.    welcome, giorgio.  how is your friend, cappello giallo grande.    oh, i can't play.  i'm making a very special meal for famous restaurant critic, sally tessio.  ah. heh.  when she likes a place, business booms.  so it's very important that everything be perfect.  she has the delicate taste.  sally: you said there'd be fresh bread.  : i don't see any bread here.  well, her taste is delicate...  : but her voice, uh, not so much.     huh.  this hard stuff was spaghetti.  hmm, didn't smell like anything.  meow, meow.  meow.    george wanted to replace his broken piece.  he'd seen the chef put the rest of it in the pot.   hm.  it didn't smell like much, and the steam coming out was hot.  george had to be careful.   it had changed.   maybe... maybe it wasn't just donut makers.  maybe all kitchens were magic.  here was a pot that turned crisp things into floppy things.  ooh, ooh.   what else could it turn floppy.  ooh.  a soft, floppy egg.  ah.  that'd be funny.   ah.  good candidate for floppification.  : oh... oh...   oh, this bread is pretty good.  you didn't really make this yourself.  oh, everything here is homemade.  i have the freshest, finest food in the city.  and i'm making the special pasta just for youvery mild, for your, uh, delicate taste.  heehee.  goody.  the great big onion looked pretty hard.    uh, well, it didn't have to taste good, just turn floppy.   if sugar were soft and floppy instead of grainy...  you could chew it all day like gum.   he put some sugar in the floppification pot.  huh.  it disappeared.  well, this made no sense at all.   george was pretty sure the brown thing was a potato.    hm.  weird.  green vegetable bats.   huh.  oh.    george explained thewholething to gnocchi, including... how funny the floppy egg was gonna look.   meow. meow.    that puffymaking oven was evenmoreamazing than the floppification pot.  : oh, my goodness.  if sally tessio likes my food, she's atell everybody to eat here. ohho.  wish me luck.   george wanted to show gnocchi how pots make things floppy.   uh. oh.        chef pisghetti: what was all of that noise...  : oy gevalt.  what have you done..  but i can't serve delicate pasta with the little monkey sitting in it.   eh. at least i still have this batch of plain spaghetti.  george knew the chef would be happy with all the fun, extra things he'd turned floppy.  who turned my plain pasta into crowded spoon soup.  somehow floppification didn't work on spoons.  there isn't one cherry tomato in this salad.  you promised cherry tomatoes.  well, i...  oh, don't... wait. no, please.  i... oh.  oh. i don't like this at all.  but it smells good.   she was right.  the longer that stuff stayed in the floppifying pot, the better it smelled.   do you know there's a cat and a monkey in your kitchen.   the monkey made the stew.  ooh. quite good.  but you said you no like it.  if you made it, it's no good.  but for a monkey, whoa.  what's his recipe.  well, uh...  never mind. i've got it.  chef pisghetti didn't scold george much, but he insisted george clean up the mess he made.   oh, you are lucky you got the four hands.  you can do things ice as quickly.  i wish i knew how you chose these ingredients.  asparagus.  the green spears turned out nice and floppy.  one hardboiled egg.  but the egg didn't look floppy at all.  eggs don't floppify.  they get harder.  a lot of cheese.  cheese becomes goop.  cooking seemed to have no rules at all.  i'm done.  you said there would be cookies. please.  this dish was excellent.  what do you call it.  sudden emergency ravioli.  and a meatball.  four stars.  and another star for the meatball.  i'll give your monkey a star, too.  oh. i'm so generous.  hot cookies coming up as promised.  how did he make that into that.  maybe kitchens aren't magic.  maybe it's cooks who are magic.  gnocchi, how you can lose so many bows, eh.   any day that starts out just smelling...   ...and ends with a cookie...  is a pretty great day.  boy: george is a monkey, so he can thdo things that we can't do.  he put lots of crazy things in the water.  look out, george, that's hot.  teacher: and we're going to learn about which materials dissolve in liquid.  what does "dissolve" mean.  it disappears inside water.  teacher: so when things are dissolved, they pass into the solution.  and so it kind of just looks like it disappears into the liquid.  which of the things at your table are able to dissolve in the water.  girl: this is sugar, and i think it's going to dissolve.  i think it's not going to dissolve.  oopsie.   okay.  yep, it dissolved.  okay. so it was trueit did dissolve.  so that one person that said it didn't dissolve was wrong.  this is cornmeal.  i think the cornmeal is not going to dissolve.  i think it is going to dissolve.  it falls like it's snow.  i don't think it's working.  it doesn't dissolve 'cause it's too hard and a little too big.  it didn't.  some things do dissolve. some things don't dissolve.  hundley was proud to be a dog who couldn't be distracted.  his mind was always on his job...  whether his friend the doorman knew it or not.   ah. what is it, boy.  hungry again.    elevator's here.  good morng.   it's a beautiful day. enjoy it.  good morning to you, too, hundley.    i know exactly what you're thinking.  hundley was thinking that, with george out there, the city might not survive.  or, worse, become completely disorganized.  who knows what his hungry boy wants.  can i read your mind, huh.  the smartest wiener dogs are always the most misunderstood.  george wanted to take the man with the yellow hat to see where he'd done his job...  ...in chef pisghetti's kitchen.  oh, giorgio was a big help to me.  he was especially good at cleaning up a mess.  well, he's had a whole lot of practice.   oh, i'm afraid i have no work for you today.   hah. you know what.  my friend, mr. glass, needs help across town, and you would be perfect for the job.    oh, george, i don't have time to take you across town.  maybe another day.   well, i can take him there if it's okay with you.   oh, great. all right.  do you promise to be a good little monkey.  uhhuh. uhhuh. uhhuh.   the job is at the building my friend ownsthe glass palace.  now, like i told you, chef, i need a window washer who can work way, way, way, way, way, wayup high without getting dizzy.  that's six ways.  oh, that's a lot of ways.  but, mr. glass, giorgio's a great climber.  he's a monkey.  congratulations.   i need every window clean by 2:15.  can you do it.   well, here's everything you need, and a cool cap.  now, window washing is serious work.  you take your work seriously.  i like that in a monkey.  never mind what people inside are doing.  don't be curious or you'll get into trouble.   george promised to be good, but a little monkey sometimes forgets.  it was hard not to look inside, but george concentrated on his work.  tammy..  oh. he's gone.  where did i go wrong.  i should've bought the padded hamster wheel.  tammy.  i never would have found you in there.  thank you, window monkey.  are you here to fix the lights.  it's always too dark in here to read.  wow, what an improvement.  but it's still too dark to read.   the whole world is so bright and clear and colorful.  thank you, window monkey.  george was feeling tired, and there was still a lot of glass to clean.  then he found a way to work faster.  george thought he saw a giraffe.  it looked just like a giraffe.  could a giraffe live here.  well, it was possible.  and that looked like a zebra...  and a leopard.  this had to be the best party george had ever seen.  we have to ask mr. glass if he really wants the whole room this rotten color.  george wondered if the giraffe lived here with a friend like the man with the yellow hat.  the giraffe and the zebra weren't saying hi.  maybe they couldn't see george in the dark.  there weren't any animals here at all.  this was an amazing thing.  shadows made animals out of furniture.  if only there was a way to show others this amazing thing.   we want you to see how the new color looks before we paint the whole place, mr. glass.  i chose that color myself.  everyone thinks it's a dull room.  i want it full of life.  but i don't know if this is exactly what you mean by "full of life."  george was thrilled someone was here to see what he'd done.  people didn't seem happy.  hmm... maybe they needed to see it again.  now with the lights off or the lights on, everyone could see the same animals that george saw.  did you do this.  no. that monkey must've done it.  george had seen people this unhappy before.  they usually needed some quiet time alone.  stop that monkey.    "monkey paints room. human painter upset".  that's got to be george.  that's just a bird.  george liked his bird okay, but he knew he could make a much better bunny.  what.  it's a bunny.  i want to talk with you, george.   george.  did you paint a room, you naughty monkey.  i don't know how to thank you, george.  yes, i...  thank him..  thank him. thank him.  you know, i would've thought that was a horsey, but, whoa, it's a zebra.  only a genius or a monkey could've thought of this.  i can rent it out as the glass palace jungle room.  george, the glass palace is always half empty, but with more special rooms like this, i bet the glass is gonna be half full.  have a good day.  yes. george had a job today, and it turned out just great.     hundley seems happy we're home.  hundley was very happy to know george was home, and the city was still working just fine.  i think he's just hungry.  girl: george is a monkey, so he cado things that you can't do.  boy: like when he cleaned those windows way up highwhen he saw the shadows.  my mom set up the sheet.  the sheet is hanging from a rope.  the sun goes down, and it hits the sheet and the sheet is white.  if you stand betweenthe sun and the sheet you make a shadow.   girl: they're trying to make four arms.  they're moving them like  dedededede    dedededededede.    the scene was all about her trying to water a plant.  she was watering me.  girl: she looked like she growed out of the ground.  and then we had a funny tree chopped over.  what you see on the sheet is different than what's happening behind the sheet.  the head falls down.  first you put the hat on the ball.  then, i put it on her neck. she waves.  we can do tricks with shadows.  ) for more fun with curious george and his friends, visit your local library and read more curious georgeadventures.  or visit thecurious georgeweb site at: captioned bymedia access group at wgbh access.wgbh.org "curious george" introduces children to math and science concepts.  org, you can help your child's early math development with the pbs parents guide to early math.  .. )
