what. let's get outside and i'll show you.  uhhuh.  and where are you boys headed on this beautiful day.  i'm taking george to the parkto elain spring.  i can explain it right here.  spring is one of the four seasons.  remember summer.  george remembered summer.  yeah.  hundley did too.  oh.  then came fall. remember.  uhhuh.  aha.    then it was winter.  ah.  hey.  oh.  well, now it's spring.  does that explain it for you, george.  uhuh.  oh. well, i guess the best way to learn is experience.  see you soon. bye.  enjoy the park.  ah.   oh.  hundley already knewwhat spring meantsome new mess georgehadn't learned how to make yet.  can you see the changes that tell you it's spring.   see. all around it's green and warm.       the ice and snow have gone away    the sun stays longer every day    you don't need your coat just a tshirt and jeans    the trees get leaves and the grass turns green    because spring brings things    that make me sing   charkie.   the snow clouds run and hide    yeah, because spring brings things    that make me sing    i've got to get outside    let's get outside    now, the view outside was white and brown    but things are changing all around    you see the butterflies putting on a show    were caterpillars just a week ago    and see in spring you'll see the buzzin' bees    squirrels and birds up in the trees    and if you look real hard and your luck comes through    you just might see a monkey too    because spring brings things    that make me sing    the snow clouds run and hide    yeah, because spring brings things    that make me sing    i've got to get outside    let's get outside    whoa, ho, ho    let's get outside    whoa, whoa    let's get outside   do you have spring fever.  betsy thinks that's why you're running around by yourself being crazy.  oh, i'm not by myself. i'm with george.  georwell, he was right, uh, here.  it's okay. there's no law against being crazy without a monkey.  aunt margret always says, "you're having fun, that's what counts."  yeah.  uh, if you're looking for charkie, she ran that way.  thanks. charkie.  happy spring fever.  oh. ooh.  hey, can you believe all the new spring things, george. yeah.  all the way home, georgecouldn't stop thinking about...  taking hundley to the park.  he didn't wanthis best dog friendto miss all the fun.     i've never seen you guys playing in the lobby before.  spring fever. huh.  that's when spring comes, and all you want to do is play.   hundley would never allowhimself to have spring fever.  that's undignified.  we're not playing. we're polishing the railings.  faster, hundley.    we want to win the mayor's springcleaning prize...  for the springiest, "cleaniest" building.  and we have some stiff competition from lydia across the alley.  come on. i'll show ya.  wow. wow.  hi, hi there.  hi. hi.  oh, you're cleaning with simple rags and mops.  don't you want to win.  oh.  wow. lydia's got some ultramodern equipment.   technology is no match for a doorman with a plan and a dachshund.  i hope.  we better work extra hard to be extra clean, hundley.    oh, you've been working hard, hundley. take a break.  hundley spent a long timelooking at ankles.  that's why he liked the roof.  standing up herewas like beingthe tallest dog in the world.  hi.  hiya, george.  george hoped, now that hundleywas finished cleaning ha.   he'd want to go to the park.   oh.  hundley isn't interested in anything else...  until we win that springcleaning prize.   cleaning this whole buildingwould take a long time.   ah.  but maybe hundley could goto the park sooner if georgehelped with the cleaning.  ah.  ah.  now where could a cleaningmonkey do the most good.   oh.  oh.  not all questionsare hard to answer.     ha.  the doorman and hundleywere sure gonna be surprised...  when they sawwhat a monkey could do.   now, let's get to work on the basement.   oh, gee. that's not right.    ah, that's not smoke. that's steam.  yeah. i have a building full of steam.  can you do anything.  why don't we get any normal calls.  do we even do steam. who does steam.  relax, everyone.  i'm a plumber. i do steam.  he must've been trying to steam clean the entire place.  he is so competitive.     this broom fell against the handle.   george, you did it.  ah.  you deserve a thank you, george.  steam blasted the dirt away and uncovered some bad pipes.  they need to be replaced from here all the way to the roof.  that'll make a mess.  can't it wait till after the contest.  i take it that's a no.   i have to turn off all the water.  yep. everyone has to get out of the building for a few days.        hi.  huh. it's lucky everyone could find places to stay on such short notice.  almost everyone.  i can't find anywhere that will allow...  dachshunds.  dacswwait. what.  dogs.  huh.  i can't find anywhere for... hundley.  oh. hey.   hey, yeah. hundley can come with us to the country house.  we have plenty of room.  how would you like to go to the country for a few days...  with your buddy george.  oh.   but i have to stick around here.  you'll be going without me.   don't forget hundley's pillow.  i promise i'll bring you home as soon as the pipe's fixed.  oh.  then we'll have time to clean up and win that contest.    i hope.  whoa. that shouldn't happen.  uh, this job may be bigger than i thought.  uh, by bigger, you mean take longer.    the only thing george knewthat was powerful enough...  to cheer up someone that sad...  was spring fever.  aha.of course.  if george taught himto love spring, hundley would catchspring fever and be happy.     george was goingto make this a triphundley would never forget.   to get started, george thought he'd explainwhat the man taught him...  about how things changein spring.   birds make nests for their eggs.  horses have their foals.  butterflies are everywhere.  and hundley thought georgehad the worst case ofspring fever he'd ever seen.   hundley would never let himselfget spring fever like that.   it was too undignified.   oh.  see, guys.  right there is where the spring balloon rally's gonna be.   you know, george.  every spring, people fly balloons representing all the stuff that's grown around here.  oh.    getting hundley interestedin spring things...  was going to bea real challenge.  okay. we're here.   hey, you guys.   who's that.  hi, bill. that's hundley.    george thought hundley wouldlike to see bill's bunnies.  who doesn't enjoyseeing bunnies.      so, these were bunnies.  they didn't seem to do too much.   oh.  hey. would you please join the balloon rally organizing team.  so far it's just me and allie.  you and allie.  isn't she... four.  i'm... five.  and i won the contest.   she won a contest...  to be the rally starter, and now she thinks she's in charge.   i'm more than happy to help out.  george. you want to help me.  i'm looking for harold mandelbrot.  ah.  bill's bunny, harold mandelbrot.  she always forgets a simple bunny name.  no one name's a bunny harold mandelbrot.  it's herbe nennger.    harold.  haoops. i mean, herbie.     herbie.   hmm.    hey, you found him. yippee. you're free.  great job, hundley.   what a good nose job. huh.  i don't think you mean nose job.  job with his nose. what else would you call it.  oh.    hundley obviously wouldn't behappy till he had spring fever.  george had to make himlove spring, and fast.  no one plans like a monkey.  so george made a listof fun country spring things.  he'd take hundleyto see these things, spring.  george's plan had to work.   or hundley might nevermove from his pillow.   sweet dreams, fellas.   good night, buddy.     in the morning,george showed hundleythe blooming green hills, which during winter hadbeen brown with snow on top.    hey.  hey, you guys.   i guess a city kid and a city dog don't get a lot of canoe rides, huh.     not wanting to be alonein the country, hundley went along.     city kids wouldn't know this, but in spring the river's fast and cold...  because melted snow flows down from the hills.      ah. whoa, george.  whoa. ah.  george, you should never stand in a canoe because that might happen.   it's too early in the season to go swimming, guys.  that water is cold.   hmm.  maybe it was best to move on tothe next item on george's list.     george knew birds flew by afterspending the winter down south.  hundley loved birds.  success was assured.   ooh. ah.   being a monkey was the best, but being a flying monkeywould be thebestbest.        oh.    i never thought of you as a rough and tumble country dog, hundley, but you're fitting right in, aren't you.    ah.  this wasn't going well, and george hadjust one item left on his list.  surely this would makehundley love spring.       george explainedhow the buds came in springand then became flowers.   and he was excited to introducehundley to his friend jumpy.   but jumpy didn't knowwhat to think aboutthis long, low city dog.            uhoh.  oh, boy.    so far, none of the thingson george's list...  had made hundley love spring.   hello.  uh, hold on.  hundley, it's for you.   hundley.  hi.    uhhuh. uhhuh.  ii called to say hi and uhhuh. uhhuh.  he is sure happy to hear your voice.  is the work done already. um, no.  the job was bigger than he thought, and then it got even... bigger.  okay. i'll let him know.   lost my wrench. could you go downstairs and, uh, get me another.  okay.  he is cleaning that building in ways i've never even heard of.  uh, it's not time to go home yet, hundley.  sorry.  hey, do you want to visit a real farm.  i'm going to the renkins' anyway.  the whole town is expecting big things from the balloons, and i have to check with all the balloon entrants.   but first, a bath.   these are the balloons that represent our town.  oh, they're great.  my favorite is the brain.  the giant flying brain should lead the rally.  that's not a brain. it's a cauliflower.  oh. well, then...  the egg should lead, followed by the chicken, because chickens come from eggs.  you mean the chicken should come first, because eggs come from chickens.  hmm. which came first, the chicken or the egg.  chicken. egg.  i suppose it would also depend on the local weather conditions, and of course changes in barometric pressure.   george wantedhundley to see the waythe farm changed in spring.     look out the window as the sunlight    pours into the room    see all the smiles upon the faces    with everything in bloom    nothing can stop me from headin' out the door to take it in    with a grin   when it's all brandnew    so many things to learn, so many things to do    the possibilities endlessly fall into view    when it's all brandnew  george pointed outthat the bigger animals...  all started small,and that he and hundleystarted small too.   thinking back to when i was so little    crawling cross the floor    so many things would make me wonder    i wanted to explore    my brain was itching they say i'm full of curiosity    and i agree    when it's all brandnew   hey.   yeah    so many things to learn, so many things to do    the possibilities endlessly fall into view    when it's all brandnew    george, hundley, we need to go. more balloon plans to check.   ooh.  hey. huh.  this here balloon is a tribute to fish.  naturally, i'll be piloting the real one.  ah.  ha. we wrote a song for allie to sing with us...  when she starts the rally.  ooh. i'd like to sing a song.     sea bass and cod sea bass and cod    i caught myself a scrod with my trusty old rod    flounder, tuna, herring yes, we are declaring    we love every fish   that is spectacularly fishy.  uh, thanks.  we'll let you know.  come on. we have a lot more people and balloon plans to see.  i brought fish crackers and juice.   fish crackers. ooh, ooh, ooh.   wow. it took all day to see everyone's balloon plans.  how long will it take us to decide an order.  here's a proper balloon order.  animals first, then fruits and vegetables, then the rest.  the order should be funny.  funny is not proper.  you're the deciding vote. funny or proper.  uh. well, uhuhfunny. say funny, funny.  proper. proper.  you know, we'll work it out.  meanwhile, allie, why don't you work on learning that song the quints wrote for you.  okay. proper is fine as long as i don't have to sing about fish.  oh, and this balloon goes first.  deal. hey, guys, good job.   should we show hundley which is first.   nah. make it a surprise.   i saw all that water before. is your basement flooded.  no. we drained the water okay but i put some crates next to the hot furnace to dry.  big mistake.   they were crates of unpopped popcorn.  hey. ah.   some people need to learn the hazards of improper popcorn storage.  i know someone who could use all that popcorn.  gee. you'd do that.  well, just because we're in competition doesn't mean i'm not a good neighbor.  thanks, lydia.  you know, i think you're gonna win, unless the judges really like that fresh popcorn smell.  well, who knows. they might.  hey, where's stew.    why don't we get any normal calls.    uhhuh.   okay. bye.  it's not time to go home yet.   soon.  hhe said he made a deal with local movie theaters to take all the popcorn away.   i don't know what that means either.   george had showedhundley everything, and he still hadn'tcaught spring fever.  but the balloon rallywas tomorrow.  george was sure hundleywould have fun there.  what could possibly ruina balloon rally.  the balloons will all take off from here, then land in town.  wow. oh.  allie, as official rally starter, you get to step on this pedal and start the rally.  it opens the rings, so all the balloons can rise at once.  like this. no, not now.   whoops.  sorry.  it's okay, allie.  but if the balloons had been full of hot air, they'd have taken off, and we couldn't get 'em back.   oh.  so, how do we get them back when they do fly. yeah.  pilots.  balloons need pilots to fly them and bring 'em back to earth.  ah. oh, i get it.  allie, did you want to show hundley that surprise.   oh. oh, yeah. come on, guys.  in honor of hundley, the lead balloon istada. take a look.  huh.   ah.   hey. where's the wiener dog balloon.   i'm going to get it as soon as i'm done here.   who is this handsome young man.  that's hundley. he's our lobby dog from the city.  ooh.  why, you should be proud just to be a dachshund.  but to have a good job too, you are a diamond of a dog.    ms. teckel, we inflate the balloons in an hour.  time's running out. okay.  who wants to come to my farm to get the balloon.      never been to a dachshund farm before.   hundley figured it was abouttime a dachshund ran a farm.   yes, sir. i will, sir.  a dachshund farm is a normal farm...  where we also raise dogs.  oh. oh.  come here, doggies.    it was a likea swarm of hundleys.    oh.   tails don't lie.hundley was very happy.  hey, dad. meet george and hundley.  hello.  hey, i thought you forgot about our doxie balloon.  huh, huh.   doesn't look like much now, but wait till it's full of hot air.   are the dogs ready, dad. we're almost done rehearsing.  come on, guys. you'll like this.  we're putting on a show in town once the balloons land.  ooh.      here we go    everybody do the dachshund dance    all we ask is give it a chance    you might find it's all you wanna do    get low, real close to the ground    shake and shimmy and then fall down    you'll laugh until your face is blue    we have a high degree of personality    everybody sing we are the wiener dogs    stompin' our feet and struttin' by    waggin' our tails way up high    we are the wiener dogs    flappin' our ears and havin' fun    that's why wieners are number one     oh, yes, we are   you wanna watch from the roof.  okay.   well, we're short, long, brown and sleek    but inside we're all unique    not every doxie is the same    some are fast and some are slow    some can jump others, no    but we're all held in high acclaim    we have a high degree of individuality    george, hundley, i'm leaving.  dad will bring you over later.      we are the wiener dogs    stompin' our feet and struttin' by    waggin' our tails way up high    we are the wiener dogs    flappin' our ears and havin' fun    that's why wieners are number one   we are the wiener dogs  that doxie is number one   we are the wiener dogs  that doxie is number one   we are the wiener dogs  hey, we're all number one    yeah    i said number one    whoo    george was sure this wasthe greatest thing...  hundley ever saw.   huh.  he must've gone downto meet the dogs.  looks great, dad.  oh, i have to go hook up the balloon now.  okeydokey.   you guys can't come with me.  sorry.   there had to be a way outof this tangle somehow.     hundley was relievedhe'd escaped fromthat floppy balloon.    and then he wasn't.  this was very undignified.   hundley had to get backto the dachshund farm.  but which way was it.   he wasn't going to getanywhere standing still.  so he took a guess.    uhuh.  hmm.  there had to be some waya monkey could pick out...  one hundleyin a sea of wiener dogs.  aha.   aha.  aw.  not one dog came overto clean up the mess.  hundley wasn't here.  where would he go.   that lobby dog could neversurvive in the country.    to find his way,hundley needed a good view.  oh.  and the highest hillwould have the best view.  mmm.  the air was different here.  it smelled like a clean lobby,except even cleaner.  now here weresome very organized,hardworking animals.  if monkeys were like that, it would be easyto keep a neat lobby.   the time comes when a monkeyhas to ask himself, "if i were a dachshund, where would i go." and then he'll gothe wrong waybecause a monkey'snot a dachshund.   hundley's stomach told himit was hungry.  but there was no food out here.   or was there.  maybe meetingthat wild nutflingerwas a good thing.    all george ever wanted to dowas help hundley enjoy spring.  and now he was gone.   a city dog,alone in the countrypoor hundley must be terrified.   hundley had never been alonein the country before.  it was so quiet.  huh.  the animals were so different.  curious.  dignified.   orderly.  this was really nice.  okay, everyone. just another minute.  wow.  i guess having stuff in proper order doesn't mean it can't be fun.  i'm glad you finally think like me.  i don't. i just think the balloons are so much fun...  that even a lot of rules couldn't make them boring.  you'll grow up and see that it's important to do things properly.  oh, i hope not.  wow. awesome blowfish, mr. quint.  why, thank you, allie.  hit it, quints.   sea bass and cod sea bass and cod   please, don't sing till after the pictures have been taken.   okay.  dad will bring george and hundley later.  they were having fun, so i didn't want to drag them away.  ah. good to hear hundley's happy.  he doesn't enjoy the great outdoors.   was it possiblehundley had spring fever.  it was undignified.  so what.    the road he was on led georgeright to the balloon rally.   ah.  doo.   aha.  that looked like a good perchfor spotting a short dog.    i can't get the balloons and people in the picture...  if they keep rising.  we're not rising.  are we.  that's my balloon.  there's no way to get them back.  this isn't proper. how could they take off with nobody in them.  somehow the mic stand was on the pedal.  but stepping on the pedal was my job.   hey. is that george.    oh, no. george, what happened.   oh, boy.  all those balloons.  and no pilots.  uhoh.  well, then he'd have topilot them himself.   what is he doing.   now that they weretied together, george was the proudpilot of all the balloons.  yeah.  except he didn't know anythingabout being a balloon pilot, and, of course,he had no ideawhere he was going.  we can't just stand here and let george get blown away.  but there's nothing anyone can do.  hey, guys. i couldn't find george and hundley.  hundley. oh, no. he must be up there with george.  can i borrow your truck.  okay. why. i've got to do something, and i'm gonna follow those balloons until i figure out what.  wait till i unhitch the... doggies.    flounder, blowfish, conger    off in the wild blue yonder    farewell to our fish   hundley reached a high spotlike he planned, but couldn't see the farm.   he was hopelessly lost.  from this high up, he couldnever spot a little monkeyor tiny dachshunds.   on the other hand, a giant, flying dachshundwas very easy to spot.   huh.  my, that lookeda lot like hundley.  it was hundley.    come on, balloons. where are you.  what is that. it sounds like the engine.  no, not from the engine. it'sit's from the back.    sorry, dogs. you're coming with me.   george was so happyhe could rescue hundley.    hey, hey. yay.   it was a long way down.  but it was the best viewa shortlegged wiener dogever had.    they were heading home.  george thoughtsomeone there had to be ableto help get them down.   there they are.  hang in there, guys.  hello.great news.  you can bring hundley back to the city now.  ha. funny you should say that.  uh, hundley and george are headed to the city right now.  just go to the roof and look towards the bridge.  i'm on the roof.  towards the bridge.  oh.  wow.  hundley and george are in those balloons.  they must be having fun.  who's driving that many balloons.  nobody.  nobody. nobody.  i'm on my way. don't lose sight of those balloons.  don't worry. nothing could make me take my eyes off of them.   ah. hey.  sorry. my canopy took off like a kite.  hey.  this might make a perfect balloon trap.  will you help me. of course.  what's a balloon trap.    wow.  is that a pig.   no, it's a flying pig.   george tried to ask peopleif they knew howto stop balloons.   wave to the flying monkey, kids.  they just smiled and waved.  oh.    shh, shh.  get ready.  i don't think two of us are strong enough to stop all those balloons.  how can i help.  grab a rope.  we've got this high enough that the dog face will pass into the canopy.   oh, gee, there's hundley.  duck down, boy. in the basket, george.  ah.     we'll save you, hundley boy.  we got it.  or it's got us.   oh.  ah.  i think we stopped it. george.  ah.   oh, hundley, you're safe.   i'm so glad you're home.   oh.  oh, hey, buddy. wow. what a day.  uhhuh.  we couldn't have done it without you, lydia.   why, i always say, there's nothing a door person can't do...  with a plan and a lot of duct tape.  i always say that too.  ooh.   wow. whoo.   yup, it's beautiful.  everyone came from the country, thrilled to gettheir balloons back.  but no one wasmore thrilled than hundley.  he was back withthe doorman and on the job.  mr. mayor. does one of those balloons belong to you.  no. i'm awarding the cleaniest, springiest building prize.  we won.  whoo. oh, hundley. all right.  we won. we did it.  and i couldn't have done it without my neighbor and good friend, lydia.  ooh.  best balloon rally ever.  let's do it the same way next year.   ready to fly your kite and give a farewell to the spring balloons.  uhhuh.    oh.  oh.  hundley had been wrong.  spring didn't bringa mess in the lobby.  instead, it brought new thingshe never would have seenwithout george.     i'll cover for you.  take a break if you want.   ah.   hehe's flying it.  go, hundley. ah. hey.   springturned out
