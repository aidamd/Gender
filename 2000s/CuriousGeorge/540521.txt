"made by dinwoodie delights." oh, that's just across the city.  well, then let's just pay them a visit.  maybe they can fix the problem.  i, uh, have some fossils to sort.  think you two can handle it.  of course. you run along. george and i will take care of this.  right, george.  uhhuh.  douglas dinwoodie.  welcome to my factory. we've never had a monkey visit us before.   now what can i do for you.  well, you see, we have a problem with one of your toys.  uhhuh.  problem. what do you mean.  it's not the bubble blower that blows backward bubbles, is it.   or the remote control car that only goes in a circle.   ooh, ooh, ooh. dizzy.  because those were supposed to be taken off the shelves months ago.  whoa.  no, actually, i bought this for george, but itit won't pick anything up.   hmm. i see. well, if it's a defective toy, we'll have to issue a recall.  come with me.  now we make lots of toys.  most of them work well, but once in a while something goes a little wrong.  oh, well, just drop it off here with the rest of them.  ooh. you don't want to figure out a way to fix it.   oh, i plan to. i'm just, well, so busy now.  but as soon as i get some time, i plan to finally fix all of these.  mmhmm. how soon will that be.  oh, at this rate, not for years, i'm afraid.  george had fixedlots of things before.  maybe there was a wayhe could help fixmr.  dinwoodie's toy.  ah.   great idea, george.  mind if we take a crack at fixing it.  well, sure. have at it.  the dinwoodie front loader is all yours.  thanks.  well, looks like we have our work cut out for us, partner.  uhhuh. uhhuh.  ooh.   hmm. it's just a ball. how could it be defective.  hmm.  whoo.  ooh. duck.  sorry i asked.  well, nothing to do but roll up our sleeves and start fixing this thing.  are you ready. uhhuh.  now before we begin, we need to protect ourselves.    george tried to rememberhow a real front loader worked.  uhhuh.of course.  if the scoop faced upward,then things wouldn't fall out.   hang on. i have just the thing.  nowoh, where did i put that thing.  ah. here it is.  never leave home without an adjustable wrench.  uhhuh.  hmm. i've also got pickles. want some.   ah.  now the toys are staying in there.  i'll hold, and you tighten.  uhhuh.   the front loaderworked great now, except for one thing.  huh.george couldn't get toysinto the scoop.  george thought aboutthe real front loader again.  the scoop neededto be able to tilt.  oh.   you're right, george. looks like we need to loosen things up.  now the scoop could move.  yeah.   now to lift the arm.  oh.  well, that didn't work, but i think we're onto something.  george knew aunt sylviawas right.  they needed a wayto make the scoop move.   yeah.  great idea.  there was only one problem.  how could george steer.  aw.  now don't you be discouraged.  reworking and revising is what engineering is all about.  i learned that when i designed roller coasters.  sometimes you have to sit through a lot of slow rides before you can zoom.    what else could he useto control the scoop.   george couldn't finda place to attach the rope.   oh, that's no problem.  luckily i've got sheila. huh.  my drill. isn't she a beauty.  uhhuh.  perfect.   now to see if it worked.   yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. it works.    wonderful.   you fixed it. i'm gonna get my toy makers right on it.  uh, do you mind if i use this as a sample.  go right ahead.  well, partner, looks like it's mission accomplished.  uhhuh.  before long, george hadhis front loader back, and it worked like a dream.  that's it. that's it. bring her in.  their work was justone small step for a monkeyand his auntthere you go.  good job, george.  but one giant leapfor mud pies.   george figured outhow to fix the front loader.  we are figuring outways to improve our toys.  we took a dump truckand a school bus.  our challengeis to scoop up marbles.  we took a tube. then we strung some orange string through it.  this is what we're going to use to pick up the marbles.  and then we put itdown the tube.  and it just goes out the tube and falls off the table.  i attached a bowl here so it won't go flying.  we're thinking maybe to put a string through here.  when we pulled it, it tipped over. we're gonna redesign the bucket.  we cut a piece of a paper plate. with duct tape we just taped it on.  and now we can just scoop it up, and it will be in here.  we did it. yay.  it was a beautiful dayin the country.  for george, it wasthe perfect kind of dayto go to a fair.  george. okay, you've got your sunglasses, your water bottle.  uhhuh.  i can't think of anything else we need.   it's fair time.  allie. what's with all the stuff.  it's my school fair survival kit.  i got everything i need to have the best fair day ever.  wow.  i got water, suntan lotion, mustard, ketchup, chair, tissues.  this is to hold my lemonade.  and what's in the backpack.  nothing. it's empty.  why are you bringing an empty backpack.  well, you never know what'll happen at a fair.  one day i brought home a pet pig.  hmm.  what should we do first. hmm, let's see.  uh, there's a craft table over there.  i see face painting.   and, wow, look at that bear.  we'll be here all weekend. uhhuh.  let's go.  ah. there he is.  dr. percival higginbothom.  i named him on the walk over.  step right up to mr. quint's duck game.  ooh. wow.  well, hello there. hi.  hi, mr. quint. wow. how do we play it.  well, you knock down all seven ducks, and the bear is yours.  well, what are we waiting for.  ah.   have fun.  george, get ready to count.   counting the successful tosseswas easy for george...  because allie didn't have any.  i'm just getting warmed up. let me try that again.     oh.  how can this be so hard.     oh, well. i guess i better give someone else a chance.  now you can come back later, you know. we'll be here all weekend.  how could something that looksso easy be so hard.  george knew why alliedidn't knock down the ducks.  shneededractice.   first, george would builda practice game for allie.  he just needed some ducks.  but he only had one rubber duck.  where could he get seven ducksthat looked alike.  there must be somethinghe could use to make some ducks.  oh.  one, two, three, four, five, six, seven ducks.   and then george filledsome bags with ricefor allie to throw.  george knew that anyonecould get better with practice.   all right, but i'm telling you, if i throw this, there's no way i'm gonna knock down a cardboard duck.  hey, hey. did i do that.  uhhuh.  oh.  maybe i should quit while i'm ahead.  uhuh.  okay.  oh.  missed again.  okay.      hey. i think i got the hang of it.   you ready.  you bet.     great job.   you knocked down one duck.  here's an eraser.  aw, thanks.  how come i'm a good duck knocker downer on your yard game, but terrible here.  hmm.  allie had a good point.  what was the differencebetween there and here.  of course. when alliehad practiced at home, the cardboard ducksweren't moving.  but how could heget them to move.  oh. uhhuh.  hmm.  ah. you wanted to see how the conveyor belt works.  well, you see, this belt is continuous.  it makes a loop around these wheels.  so, when the machine is on, the belt goes around and around.   yep.  george liked the conveyor belt.  hmm.  how could he make one.  some belts would bea good start.   uh, george, have you seen my oh. yeah, uh, never mind.  now he just neededsome wheels to make it move.  you need wheels. uhhuh.  maybe my grandpa has some we could borrow.  we could ride our trikes over.  ah.  you want to ride over upside down.  well, we could try. oh george, that's a great idea.  after removingthe fenders and tires, george had his conveyor belt.  now for the cardboard ducks.   it was almost likethe game at the fair.  but there wassomething missing.  hmm.   that was better.   oh. when the ducks move, it's harder to hit 'em.  i don't think i'll ever be good at this.        it was working. allie wasgetting better with practice.   oh. i did it.   hey. it looks like you're ready to go back to the fair.   stop that bear.  uh, time for one more game.  you've got, uh, three minutes.  just enough time.     all right, allie.   yes.    good job.  oh, looks like somebody's been practicing.  she sure has. uhhuh.   two ducks to go.  george could hardly stand it.    whoohoohoo.  just one duck left.   aw. almost, allie.   uh, you know, um, i'm not sure i can do this.  maybe we should just come back next year.  uhuh, uhuh, uhuh.  just try.   you're right.    aha.   i knew she could do it.  whoo. way to go, allie.  aha. i did it.  ii mean,wedid it.  here, george. this is for you.  huh.  sure. for helping me to become a good duck knocker downer.  aw.  wow, that is very nice of you, allie.   you know, that duck game was pretty easy.  i just had to practice, try hard and not give up.  uhhuh.  this was george'sfavorite fair ever.  allie learned to practiceand got her ducks in a row, and george got a bear.  oh, i can't wait for the apple festival next month.  you'll want to go with me because i know everything about it.  i'm really good at picking apples, you know.  and bobbing for them.  and, mmm, eating apple pie. i'm really one of the best apple pie eaters around.  allie practiced playingthe duck game.  we're learning to playa tossing game too.  yay. we drew a dog on a big box...  and then cut out the mouth.  it's for our dog bonetoss game.   yeah. it was very, very easy.  i'm gonna try this one.   aw. aw.  this one is a little heavier, and this one's a little lighter, so you can't get it in there.  the soft bone was so light.it was hard to throw itwhere you wanted it to go.  i'm tossing a paper towel roll.  i was throwing it like an airplane.   yay.  this is a birdie.   we learned thatwhen you are tryingto throw something, the weight and the shapemake a difference.  announcer: the biggest event of the summer is on pbs kids.   announcer: watch the special meet the new
