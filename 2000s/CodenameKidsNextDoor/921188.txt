forever enshrined in the hearts of all kids who love to smash things.    wallabee.   but, mom.  how do you know this guy isn't up to any antikid activity.  have you done background checks, had his office bugged, or, at the very least, broken into his house while he was sleeping and given him a thorough brain scan.   no, nigel dear, i haven't, because the last doctor you did all that to has a court order saying you can't be within three miles of him.  and i would prefer if you would just letthisdoctor give you your moose bumps shot without all your usual rigamarole.   but, moom.   shush.  good morning.  my son nigel uno is here for his 3:00 appointment.   yes, yes.  ..um...uno.  ..uh...  bald boy.  well, if you'll just change into this, the doctor is waiting for you in the examination room right down the hall.   i'll bet he is.   oh, just get on with it, nigel.  i'll wait for you out here.   but, moooooom.  hello.   wrong room. sorry.   oh, i say. mr. uno.  come in. come in, old boy.  yes, very good.  do have a seat and help me finish off these splendid cookies, would you.   who wwho are you.   oh, of course.  how rude of me.   sharp is the name.  please, dear boy, sit down.  i took the liberty of ordering you a grape soda, but i can have the nurse bring you a different flavor, should you like.   no.  ..grape's fine.    right.  let's cut to the chase, shall we, nigel.  moose bumps are a horrible affliction, and it's my job as a doctor to prevent them.  but nobody likes getting their shots, yes.  and just between you and me, i never liked getting my shots either when i was your age.   really.   of course not.  yes, i ran away at the very thought of them, you see.  so, the very least i can do is to let you do the same, yes.    huh.   oh, you heard me.  take a few of these wonderful cookies with you, if you like, as well.   really.  you're letting me go.   free as a bird, old chap.  you're the best doctor i've ever been to.   why, thank you, old boy.  ..  i never said i wasn't going to chase you.    uno, i find it rather unsporting to just hold children down and give them their moose bumps shots, so i like to give them a sporting chance.   escape me and you escape getting your shots.  but, of course, we know there's not much chance of that happening, now, is there.   you're you're mad.   oh, come now, mr. uno.  you've only got 10 seconds before i start after you, and you're wasting them calling me names.  .   actually, it's only about five now.      wwwhere am i.   why, you're in my office, old boy.   aaaaaaaaaaaaah.   ooh, i say.  this uno boy might actually be a challenge.  nurse jumbo, could you come here, please.  ohh. thrilling.   good heavens, nurse jumbo.  what the devil have you been eating.  just look at you.  very well, then.  we'll work off some of those crumpets, eh.    whoa.    whooooa.  ohh.    i've got no weapons, no way to contact the other kids next door, and no pants.  mmmmm.  nothing nigel uno hasn't been through before.    well, nurse jumbo, let's just see what we've caught here, shall we.  hmm. clever boy.  what's this.  but not clever enough.  quick, nurse jumbo after him.       faster, nurse jumbo.  we're right on his tail.  game over, mr. uno.  though, this clearing does look familiaaaar.  ]  looks like they got my "   ohh.  looks like i've underestimated this boy, what.  well, no matter.   this is getting jolly fun.   tallyho.    waaah. wahhahhah.  waaah.  oof.   this has been good fun, uno, but i'm afraid you're surrounded.       bottoms up, old boy.      waaaaah.  whooooa.    ohh.  don't just sit there, nurse jumbo give me the heavy artillery.  try running from this, my good man.   heat source located.  target locked.    whoa.  yaaah.  whoooa.  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah.   heat source lost.   i say, we should have heard a jolly good scream of inoculation by now, don't you think.   heat source located.  target locked.   oh, biscuits, nurse jumbo.  i don't see him anywhere.   great balls of cotton.  ]       whoa.   grr.  no one escapes dr. phineas b. sharp, mr. uno.  after him, nurse jumbo.     what do you mean, you quit, .     oh, so you got hit by a few stray shots.  well, boohoo.  it's not like elephants can get moose bumps anyway.     well, fine.  you be that way, then.  ..  arrrrgh.  i'll go and give nigel uno his moose bumps shots myself.   dreadful indeed.    ..keep this up...much longer.  aaaaah.   i do have other appointments uno, so let's get this over with, shall we.   no.  get away.    there's nowhere to run, nigel, so why don't you take your shots like a man.   no.  you can't make me.  whoa.    yyou're notpreventing aaaaaah.  ooooooh.   so, you've figured it out, have you, old boy.  i'm not preventing moose bumps.  i'mcausingthem.   and by turning you miserable children into mooses, i'll have all the antlers i need to saw off, grind up, and make into "chester's marvelous moosicles," an icecream treat that'll make me an eleventy bimillionaire.    you you're insane.  i'll stop you if it's the last ..i...do.   ah, but thisisthe last thing you'll do.  can you feel it.  it's already happening.   huh.    what have you done to me.     what.  ..  this can't be happening.     whoa.  aaaaaaaaaaaaaah.  and that's what's going happen if you make me get my moose bumps shots.  is that what you want, mom.  is it. huh.   oh, don't be ridiculous,
