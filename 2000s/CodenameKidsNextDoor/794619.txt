adult research facility near the north pole, where a lone scientist isnear completion of an insidious device.  its purpose control the earth's weather so that schools never have a snow day again.  we have immediately set off in our snow sub to rendezvous with kids next door arctic operative numbuh 30c.  our mission gain control of the weathercontrol device and reprogram it to make the entire school year one big snow day.  numbuh 30c, it's a pleasure to be on a mission with someone so highly recommended by kids next door headquarters.  the pleasure is all mine, numbuh 1, but are you sure your team is up for this kind of mission.  it's pretty dangerous.  i'm sure that you'll find our team bravely faces any attempt at adult tyranny, no matter how grave the threat or impossible the mission.  and besides, it's just one scientist.  what can one grownup do against six of us.   only minutes to go before my ingenious device is complete, and then i, professor xxxl, will proceed to change the world for kids everywhere.   but first, a nice, hot bowl of soup.   steady as she goes, numbuh 2.  maintain present course and we'll reach the adult facility in a matter of hours.  aye, aye, numbuh 30c.  he's cool.  yeah, if you like penguins.  so, 30c, what's life like in the arctic.  oh, it's just like anywhere else you know, wrestling packs of those big, white bears over territory, sleeping on glaciers to keep warm, eating nothing but fish blubber to stay alive.  the usual.  man, that guy's like an icy tarzan.  yeah.  i sure wish i was raised in the arctic.  hey, we just passed the research facility.  let me see.  i mean, i no wonder. you, uh, had the coordinates wrong.   oops.  oops, indeed.  ..there.  30c, you will assume command of the sub and provide cover.  numbuhs 2, 5, and 3, come with me.  we're going after that device.  .  you stay here and help numbuh 30c, numbuh 4.  watch what he does.  numbuh 30c is an expert in arctic warfare.  you might learn something.  yeah, maybe he could teach you how to be cool.   be careful, 30c.   wow, that numbuh 3's kind of cute, huh.  . let's just stick to business here, slushball.  so, what do we do first for this cruddy arcticwarfare stuff.  well, the first thing us arctic guys always do is have a snack, that's an order.  stupid penguin. for goodness' sake.   hmm, now, where did i put that uh, i thought i had a aha.  yeah.  let's see. ah, yes, french, uh huh.   super kold environment engine bike is kinda enormous.  come on.  .  well, perhaps you'd like a nice, hot bowl of soup.  i recommend the minestrone missile.   go get the team.  uhoh, incoming soup. evasive action.  hang on.  ohhh.  was that minestrone.  come on, numbuh 5, now watch this.  wheeee.  yeah.  .  they changed direction.  30c, try intercept missiles now.  30c, are you there. we need intercept missiles.  hello. numbuh 30c.  here's your cruddy soda.  .  numbuh 1's calling us.  hey.  sorry about the wait, numbuh 1.  numbuh 4 was busy with a soda while i was pretargeting those missiles on your whoaoaoaoaoa.  ughhh. ughhh. ughhh. ughhh.  ugh.   get him.      that scientist is headed for the lab.  fire the new torpedo.  finally some action. preparing to target.  stand down, numbuh 4.  i'm in command here.  i'll take care of this guy personally.  aloha, baby.   what.  come on. we're gaining on him.  huh. huh. huh. huh.  aah. aah. aah. aah.    did you get him. come on, let me see.  did you get him.   think you can just walk in here and take my ingenious device, .  let's see how you fare against my  tada  laboratortoise.  well, at least we know that the new torpedo works.     aah. aah. aah. aah.  code whale. code whale. we need a code whale.  code what.  move over, popsicle boy.  code whale coming up, numbuh 1.  . i'm in charge here.  aah. aah. aah. aah.  aah. aah. aah. aah.  not bad.  well, let's see how you like thesepopsicles, kiddies.    huh.   ugh. ugh. ugh.  well, well, well, what do we have here.  looks like we have you and your insidious device right where we want you.  so what are you gonna do now.  numbuh 30c: he's gonna leave and finish his research.  stupid kids next door.  this man's research will change the world, and i can't let you stop that.  numbuh 30c, you doublecrossed us.  oh, come on.  even my name should have given it away.  numbuh 30c.  . duh..  that is, like, 80 degrees fahrenheit or something, you dopes.  aw, metric stinks.  i gave you wrong directions, ignored your cries for help, used your new torpedo against you, and now i'm gonna release the professor and destroy your precious snow sub.  aah. ugh.  way to go, numbuh 4.  .   we gotta help numbuh 4.  quickly, to the bridge.   idiot.  get with it, dope.  pineapple breath.  okay, i give up.  help is here, numbuh 4.  numbuh 4.   initiating selfdestruct sequence in five seconds.  ..3...2...1...  byebye.  ew. ugh.  ow. oh. oh.  ugh. ugh. aaah.  why, you lousy traitor.  .  i did it for a snow cone.  .  not just a snow cone. theperfectsnow cone.  perfect texture, perfect temperature, perfect flavor that doesn't all sink to the bottom of the cone.  and you idiots have ruined my research.  . why, why, why, why, why, why, why, .  i, uh, we thought you were building a, uh what could you possibly think .  um, building a weathercontrol device.  oh, no, no, that'sbob'sproject.  he works just over the hill there.   only minutes to go before my device is complete, and schools will never have a snow day again.   ..4...3...  ]   you want it, boy. here, here.  fetch.    respect the pouch, respect it.    huh. sorry. my bad.   it's good versus evil with hot wheels battle force 5, one in each mcdonald's happy meal.      hey, ronald, wanna pogo.  give me a second.      jump to the beat,
