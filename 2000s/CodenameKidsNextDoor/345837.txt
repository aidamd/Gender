 there, or you're grounded for double life.   now, connie, relax.  while she's grounded.   i am just trying to make the perfect dessert for our dinner sundae takes con you must have the right ice cream, the best bananas, and the richest chocolate sauce oh.  i forgot the chocolate sauce.  noooooo.   and when i was a child, all we could afford for dessert were those styrofoam packing peanuts, which weren't so bad, you know, if you put some brackish water on them.    i'm afraid the sundaes aren't ready yet.   all: ohh.   but we do need somebody to run out and get some chocolate sauce.   all: me.  ..  e, me.  me, me.   hoagie.   uh, not me.  i, uh, i got this thing with chocolate sauce.   don't be ridiculous.  going before i make you, you little  okay, okay.  jeez.   now, as i was saying, there was this one time when all we had for dessert was metal shavings hard to swallow.    pplease, little girl, i promise not to spank another child ever again.   oh, it won't beyouspanking children anymore.  once my pizatronic defibrillationer power switcher goes into effect, you won't be spanking anything ever again.   aaaaaaah.  aaaaaaah.   ice cream sundaes they have always been my favorite.  but what makes them so good.  is the the whipped cream or the nuts.  maybe the cherry on top.  nope.  it's the chocolate sauce.  back then, i couldn't get enough of the stuff.  i was hitting the sauce for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  it was like every meal was dessert for me.  so i had to drop it, drop it like a pair of dirty underwear into the hamper.   hello.  anybody home.  anybody.  okay, then.  i'll just leave this money here for the sauce, okay.  huh.    well, well, well.  what have we here.   joe balooka.  he used to be on the schooluntil i fingered him for helping nurse claiborne make apple crumble using kids' pinkeye crust as topping.  since then, the only work he can get has been patrolling the parking lot of his dad's store.  and guess who he blames for that.   hoagie gilligan, what brings you to my father's store when the power's out.  aside from hitting the sauce, that is.   knock it off, joe.  you know i'm off that stuff.   are you, now.  as i recall, you used to have a real problem with chocolate sauce when we were on the safety patrol together.  you'd do anything to get some.  looks like you'd even resort to stealing it.   that was a long time ago, joe, and i didn't steal it.  there's money on the counter.  see for yourself.   maybe i will.  stewie, take a look inside.   bbut it's dark in there, joey.   just do it.   aaaaaah.   it
