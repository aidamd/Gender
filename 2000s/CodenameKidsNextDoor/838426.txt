behold.  gilligan, the lord of the losers, on the cusp of a toobathon victory.   and it's all thanks to farfegtubing.   a most impressive victory if it wasn't for the fact that all the other contestants are about to be baked into a ginormous cake by the evil father as we speak.   what did you say.  gilligan, the lord of the losers  not that the other thing.   the other contestants father dumped them into a giant cake pan, and he's going to bake them into a huge, tasty cake.  look, i didn't mean all that stuff i said about you before.  so after you win, you think i could get a taste of that cake.  hey.  the finish line is that way.  where are you going.  what about toobathon.   there's always next year.   next year.  truer words have never been spoken by such a loser.    well, that should take care of the mixing.  so i'd say, it's about time we you know, i love baking.  why, it's more than a hobby, actually.   yeeeehaw.  uh.    betsy.  oh, betsy, no.   well, if it isn't hoagie p. gilligan.  and if i'm not mistaken, the same flabby, pathetic inner tube that your loser father used to race with.   you shut up about betsy.  my dad won toobathon every year with her.   ha. is that what he told you.  why, your dad came in last place every year.   that's not true.  my dad was a winner.    i suppose he filled your tiny head with all that farfegtubing nonsense, so di.  there is no s thing as farfegtubing.  your father lied to you.  your father was a loser, just like you.  just like that lousy inner tube.   no.  i believe in you, betsy.  i believe my dad.  i believe aah.     uh oh. uh.  ..  what.  well, that can't be good.   it's a sad day indeed for toobathon, as it seems there will be no winner.  no champion to claim the delightful children's cake.  no  wait.  i think i see something.   is it my hoagie.   it looks like a whole lot of cake batter.    yay.   it all comes down to this, folks.  it's nigel uno in first place, followed by fanny fulbright.  no from behind comes that kid.  but wait, abigail lincoln has moved into the lead.  no, it's kuki sanban.  but here comes muffy jenkins in the final stretch, and the ..  ladies and gentlemen, in all my years of tubing i have never seen anything like this.  for the first time in toobathon history, we have a 634way tie for first place.  this has truly been a race that not only anyone could win, but everyone did win.  everyone, except hoagie p. gilligan.   hoagie.  can you believe tommy actually came in first place.   that'sthetommy.   finally, a gilligan has won toobathon.   but, mom, dad always told me he won toobathon every year.   oh, hoagie, you should know better than to believe everything your father says.  oh, the imagination on that man.  did you know that he swore that one day, that raggedy old tube would save all the children in town.   as if.  what that man saw in that thing, i'll never know.   it's called farfegtubing, mom.   oh, not you, too.  one, two, three, four    we do the
