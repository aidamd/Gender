is fun.  delightfulized minions, take them.  together:  join us.  we'd love to join you.  where are we going. oh.   nigel.  join us.  nigel. wait.  not now, lizzie.  but we didn't get our picture.  forget about the stupid picture.  no.  don't you want to be able to look back on these treasured moments years from now.  i'd like to live that long.  well, if you're not going to hold still for the official photo, i'll just have to take one of my own.  fine. aaah.  just keep moving.  i got a pretty good camera, you know.  it's got autofocus with a builtin star filter.  aaaah.  join us.  for a group shot. great idea.  aaaah.  run.   come on.  oh, nigey.  i definitely want a picture of this.  shh. be quiet.  and it'll work, too, 'cause i have 2,000speed film loaded, suitable for low lighting

going to go deal with the delightful children.  just one second, mister.  first, you spend almost no time with me the entire night.  then you say you don't want to take an official photo.  then you take my camera and take everyone else's picture instead.  i don't know what your problem is, but if you don't shape up soon, i'm not even gonna let you walk me home.  and then you'll have to go tell all your friends how you blew it so bad on your date ..is... not...a...date.  it was never a date, and even if you thought it was a date, i don't care.  i've got more important things to worry about than some girl who's who's datecrazy.   all right, all right.  that's it. show's over.  back up, people.  the party's over, delightful dorks.  time to face the music.  nigey, nigey, nigey.  now, why
