think mr. fishy is sleeping.   well, of course he isn't sleeping not with all this racket going on.  but if we're all really quiet fishy can get his beauty sleep.  shh.   okay, this is not good, guys.  fishy is really, you know, then it's only a matter of time until you know who gets wind of it.    ...bring me...   together: fish.    oh, come on.  i don't see why i have to go and dump this fish.  i don't even know where this place is.   that's exactly why numbuh 2 is going with you.  we don't use that part of the tree house much anymore, and he's the only one who knows how to get there.   so, while you guys dump that fish, numbuh 1 and i will go get another goldfish for numbuh 3.  she'll never know the difference.   and we don't have much time, so we better get moving.  come on, numbuh 4.   ohh.  ughughugh ugh.  huh.  hmm hmmhmm.   all right, let's do this thing.    oh, mr. fishy, are you up yet.  too much sleep isn't good for your cholesteraah.  .  uh, here, fishy, fishy.  here, fishy, fishy, fishy.  here.  fishnappers.    hey, numbuh 2, where exactly is this place anyway.   past the gaping valley of rusted scrap and over the splintered steps of salvage, to the farthest edge of the tree house.  behold.    all the way over there.  why don't we just give the crazy old cat lady the fish and save ourselves some walking.   no way.  you know that if you feed a cat once, it'll just keep coming back for more.     let's go, numbuh 4.  and be careful.  these walkways are pretty old, so watch where you're stepping.      oh, man, what is it about dead stuff that is so cool.   okay, when you say "cool," are you sure you don't mean "gross".  ugh.    i got the fish all clean and neat    listen, numbuh 4.   what.   run.      wait up, numbuh 2.  .   there's an escape tunnel at the end of this catwalk.   don't use that word.   there it is.   let's pour it on.      together: aah.  aaaah.     ugh.   well, at least we're safe down here.   and so is mr. fishy.  oh, crud.   are you sure you can do this.   piece of cake.   look, maybe you ought to let me try.   i've got it.   but you're really not good at this.  . i am so good at if you want a goldfish, you got to get a pingpong ball in a bowl.  otherwise, beat it.  you're scaring away my customers.   uh, numbuh 2, what are those things.   guinea pigs.   they're what the kids next door used to power the tree house with before we switched to hamsters.  they must live down here now.    huh.     phew.   hey, careful with that.   yeah, we've got to dump that fish before the crazy old cat lady gets her oily paws on it.   that's right, cats, and they're in the tree house, looking for that fish, and who knows what else they'll eat along with it.      what do you think that meant.  no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.   no way.  this game is totally rigged.   you wanna try again.  it's just another buck.   here, let me try.   oh, no, i'll showyou.   we're really sorry for any misunderstanding, chief guinea pig.  and thanks for showing us the way out of here.   find you either.   so long.   give me.  ..  ..  fishy.    oh, fishy fishy fish, my fishy fish.   come on, numbuh 4, it's just over this hill.   fishy fishy fish, my fishy fish fish.  oh, fish, fishy fishy, fishy fish.  what.   uh, maybe i should carry the fish for a while.   no.  i mean, uh, i got it.   well, all right.  ..    fish.  give me

but once you wake up, we'll be friends forever.  right.  that's why they all want me to throw you in this toilet, because they're jealous.  well, i won't do it.   numbuh 4.  the crazy old cat lady is coming.  you've got to throw the fish in now.   no way.  you just want to separate me and mr. fishy because we're happy.   you can't be friends with that fish, because he's  don't say it.  fishy's just sleeping, and when he wakes up, we're going to go to amusement parks and have sleepovers and watch scary movies together because we are the bestly bestest best friends ever.   buti'myou're bestest best friend.   you you are.   of course.    ..me...the...fish.   aah. whoa.     aaaaah.  hyah.  give me back my fish.   numbuh 3.    hey, you made it back.  it's just like i told you.  all you
