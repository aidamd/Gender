thing i can figure is that the real nigel uno is trapped in some parallel dimension.  or maybe hoboken.  regardless, i'll sendyouback to your world, and hopefully, he'llcome back to ours.   so you're letting me go.   yep.  just sign the bill of no rights for kids, and you're out of here.   i can't do that, hoagie.  i'd be dooming these kids.  .  once you're home, this'll all just be a bad dream.
