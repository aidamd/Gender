year's celebration grrreat.  my fellow kids next door, congratulations on another year of fighting adult tyranny.  now, the only thing stopping us from enjoying the biggest bowl ..  a long, boring speech.  so let's eat.     those kids next door had no idea we knew about their plan all along.  wait till they get a load of the prize in this cereal.  deploy the lasers.   kids next door, are you .

waaaaah joooo.   huh.    phew.   i flushed it.  i flushed the whole thing.  ha ha ha.   noooo.  my glorious plan destroyed.  ..   oops.   great party, numbuh 1.   hey, hey, look.  we captured all the villains.  my plan worked like a charm.   .  that wasn't your plan, snotbrain.  i told numbuh 362 you dopes shouldn't have been in charge of this year's anniversary.  hey, look.  it's the grand canyon.    ahh.   come back here, toilenator.  thank you, iq,for lending me your objectsfor my catapult.   ..not now.  this won't stop me.  .. ohhh...ticket.  try goldfish grahams.  baked with whole

you know, numbuh 3, while it's nice to give the hamsters a break from powering the tree house every year, don't you think it's dangerous sending them on vacation all at once.   oh, come on.  what could possibly  hey, guys.  what you doing, huh.   hi, lizzie.   where's nigie.  i baked a special pie to welcome him back.  what.   don't point that thing at us.  it might go off.   very funny.  just tell me where nigel is.   he's not here.  we were just on our way to pick him up in jamaica.  .  he told me he was going on a secret mission and that he'd be lucky if he made it back.   well, if i was going to sector "j," with its 52 swimming pools, 24hour allyoucaneat icecream buffets, and 365 miles of waterslides, i might not make it back, either.   especially if i was there with numbuh 10.  hoo hoo.  she can fly my ship any day.   numbuh 10.  .  ..   no one.   well, if you consider being the leader of sector "l," the anchor of the kids next door news network, and the prettiest girl in the whole kids next door "no one," then, yeah, she's no one.   why, that twotiming creep.  go off to jamaica with some other girl, huh.   um, lizzie, where do you think you're going.   i came to give nigel a pie, and i'm gonna give it to him, all right.  right in the face.   i don't think that's such a good idea.   and besides, that flight's totally booked.   get me to jamaica now.   oh, look, there's a seat in aisle 72.  enjoy your flight.   really, nigel.  that's fascinating.  i had no idea we had so much in common.   yeah, who would have thought.  and, you know, i think this is the first time i'm actually relaxing a bit instead of constantly thinking about missions and stuff, although i'll probably keel over if i have another smoothy.    maybe i'm rubbing off on you a little.   another mango smoothy, mon.   oh, what the heck.   toiletpaper tube to chew on, sir.  chew tube.  would you like a chew tube.  chew tube for you.     okay, i'll bring you your sunflower seeds in a second.  chew turrrrrr.  demetri.  what did i say about squirting .    ohh.    mmm.  man, i still can't believe these crumbles are made with .  i've been on kiddy rides that go faster than this thing.   hey, no passengers in the cockpit, lizzie.   i'm trying to fly here.   well, you better fly faster.   flying is an art, lizzie.  you don't just fly "faster," you have to account for wind shear and altitudeness velocity.  so unless you want to try flying this 20kamillion tons of wood and duct tape yoursed suggest you go back to your seat.    and so, fellow kids next door officers, as leader of sector "j," i, numbuh 1 love, would like to thank you for coming to this year's kids next door senior command superrelaxing retreat and icecream social.   your ship should be arriving shortly to take
