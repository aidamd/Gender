..to plan.   but of course.  after stealing their election and pitting the grades against one another, the students at gallagher elementary are weak and armed with nothing but stupid bicycles and scooters.  they'll be no match for your teenage technology.   excellent.  once we defeat your school, every teenager in ours will have their own little slave to carry their books and wash their sweaty gym clothes for them.   and for delivering them to you, we'll be made honesttogoodness eighthgraders.  right.   just make sure those kids next door are out of the picture.   finally, by selling out this miserable school, we'll be made eighthgraders and be that much closer to glorious adulthood.  what.  what are you looking at.   a bunch of treasonous creeps.   huh.   any other words you'd like to say to the school before we throw you out of office.   what.  aaaah.  you'll pay for this, nigel uno.  this isn't over yet.    hendry middle school, three minutes and closing.  repeating hendry

could become eighthgraders.  me, i'm a fourthgrader and if you think i'm going to let a bunch of gawky middleschool kids come and make me carry their books for them, then they're going to have to do
