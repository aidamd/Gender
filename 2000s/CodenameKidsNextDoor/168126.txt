why waste your time.  you're perfectly capable of getting an "f" without doing anything.  i'm serious.  it's about time i proved to everybody just what kind of genius i am.   we already know what kind of genius you are.  exactly.  i spent all night calibrating the answers.  and i found new and better ways to spell some of the words.  i'll be getting 120%, super "a"plus, for sure.  i'll even letyoucopy it.  so you can get an "a"plus in spelling, too.  copyyourhomework.  you can't even spell your number.  the only reason you did your homework is because you think the new teacher is cute.  that that's not true.  i, uh, did it strictly for educational purposes.  and for your information, the number 4 is spelled with a "q" in australia.  ms. thompson would know that.  whatever.      let's do this.  boy: you have number 60.  boy : yeah, i got t it.  you have number 81. got it.  number 75. got it.  oh, that's rare. number 42.  i need that one. you have number 9.  got it. number 48.  need that one. 72.  72, yeah. what about 86.  uh, no.   bandits.  yeehahahahahahaw.     don't nobody move 'cause this here's a stickup.  i am telling you the word "chicken" does not have a two in it.  well, it does now.  mmm, mmm, mmm.  huh.  hey, genius.  check this out.  not now.  i'm working on a way to spell "mississippi" with no "s's." everybody, freeze.  put your hands in the air.  um, excuse me.  technically, it's impossible for us to "freeze" and put our hands up at the same time.  obviously, freezing implies a lack of movement.  and putting our hands up will create movement.  ..  my
