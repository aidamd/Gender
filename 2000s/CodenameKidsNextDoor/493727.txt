 ohh. oh. ow. ohhoh.  and yet the adults got no respect from children, these strange, shortlegged creatures with snot running down their noses.  with the adults already overworked and given no time to themselves, the children demanded that they construct the coolest monument yet a grand tree h one larger than all the tree houses before it that all of kiddom could live in and play, and they called it " the adults worked endlessly around the clock to keep this seemingly impossible vision, while still keeping up with their cooking, lawnmowing, and attending to their children's whims, ..   oh, giddyup, boy.  it was not long before seeds of dissent took root.  wigglestein a name that will never be forgotten.  he was the first of his kind to rise up against children in what would come to be known " wigglestein's trial, the prosecution argued for a child's right to play horsey whenever and as much as he or she wanted.  wigglestein testified that he had had a rough day at work and just didn't feel like playing horsey.  pressed to the point of madness by his child's constant whining, mr. wigglestein finally snapped.  in a blind rage, he grabbed the child and rapidly paddled his bottom with his hand.  this new, rather stingy act, was from then on called "spanking" and forever chged the relationship between kids and adults.  the furious leaders of children quickly ordered the immediate exile of mr.  wigglestein and every one of his kind from every tree house on the planet.  banished from childland, the adults set off to find their own promised land, a place without tree houses, where children wouldn't always complain and jump up and down on the bed a place they could call home.  they christened this new place "cleveland," and in time, it prospered.  the adults built suburban houses, went to lecture series, and ate liverwurst sandwiches.  eventually, their industries bred products that not even childhood could resist.  " but the adults' demand for money made it difficult for children to obtain these toys without having to stoop to tasks like delivering newspapers and mowing lawns for the adults.  the children were outraged.  why should they be forced to pay for the adults' creations when the adults were creations of their own.  many among them wished to simply take the toys but knew they could not do so, so long as adults held the painful threat of spanking over them.  so the children devised a desperate act, one that kids would attempt again in the future with similarly disastrous results the destruction of coffee, the adults' energy source.  without it, the children could march right into cleveland and take the toys from the cranky and powerless adults.  the prolonged bombing of cleveland's coffee shops lasted for weeks, but unlike the children's delicately and shoddily crafted tree houses, the adults' coffee shops had nothing to fear from water balloons.  man: the age of children is over.  numbuh 1: outraged at the children's unwarranted attack, the adults decided the children needed "   charge.  run away like little girls.   whoa.  no. ow, ow.   oh, the pain.  oh, my numbuh 1: thus did cleveland's troops advance outward in every direction, and one by one, the tree houses of children fell.  it was not long before childhood's greatest monument, the very symbol of their greed, came under attack, and the children ran away.   victory.  that hurt them more than it hurt me.  with the fall of the superdoublemegatriple tree house, the children fell back to the only remaining place where they could escape the powerful adults the moon.  satisfied with their victory over the earth, the adults allowed the children to live on the moon, where they could make all the noise they wanted and stay up all night eating candy and watching cartoons.  and for a time, it wasn't so bad.  but it was not long before children began to yearn for the oceans they once swam in, the forests they once explored, and the toys they once played with on earth.  it was at this very same time that adults fell victim to the same sins of laziness and greed that had befallen the children before them.  they missed having kids doing chores for them taking out their trash and shoveling snow from their driveways.  so the adult ambassadors came to the moon base with plans for a civil, stable relationship with children, one where they could all live on the earth in harmony and equality.  the children decided to willingly return to the earth and live together with adults " children and adults could finally live together as equals.  .  soon afterwards, the adults created places to imprison children called "schools" where they drained out all of our memories so that we'd forget wecreatedthem.  and if that wasn't bad enough, they invented homework and afterschool activities to control us even more.  coming from the fluorescent lights above your heads.  that's the adult microwave cranial jellifier slowly turning our brains into milk shakes.  and the stuff they serve on thursdays in the cafeteria.  it's rainbow monkey.  they're making us eat rainbow monkey.  and then they make you brush your teeth, because if your teeth rot out, then they can't implant the submolar tracking devices they use to tell where you go when you escape.  it's a lie. everything you know is a lie.   mr. uno, that's enough.  rise .  .  but i was just getting to the good part.  uno, that report has absolutely nothing to do with the signing of the declaration of independence.  doesn't it,
