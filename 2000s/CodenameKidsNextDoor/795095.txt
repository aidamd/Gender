love you, james nixon mcgarfield.   you did all that for me.   yes.  i would do anything to be near you.  i'm sorry, but now that the truth is out, maybe you'll learn to like me while we're incarcerated together.   and maybe i will learn what it really means to love.   uch.  get these guys to the arctic prison before i get totally sick.   maybe i'll learn to love.  ooh, i love you.  blech.  you will never catch me acting like that, not with anyone.   aaaaaaahhhh.  aah.   oh, you're in trouble.   what.  what'd i say.  seriously.  what did the doctor say.  well, he said he'd be all right, but he'll need a lot of care.   ..  ...  yeah.  good.  you'd better tell her her father will be all right.  right.  ..  be all right.  doctor says your father be all right.  ... what did she say.  she said she'd help you and take care of you.  she says she loves you very much.  joe.  yeah.  what's the sign for daughter.  it's easy.  captioning sponsored bymtv television networks captioned

front ..lawn.  i thought i'd drop by and see how you were.  oh, no busier than usual.  but you'll have to forgive my talkin' whilst i work.  i been up since 4:00 this mornin'.  only got half this house clean.  22 rooms. not really.  oh, i got a excuse.  i had a extraheavy laundry to do.  we had spare ribs last night for supper.  and that means a couple of hundred napkins for jethro alone.  granny, please. stop a moment.  i can't. i'm behind schedule.  i had to bend a new rug beater.  my scrub board broke.  i had to rewash all the windows after that shower last night.  them things slows a body down considerable.  can't the youngsters help you.  oh, they do.  jethro made me this mopper.  no, i mean do some of the work for you.  i can't trust any of 'em.  i've only found one person who can clean to suit me, and you're lookin' at her.  ..  granny, you can't go on like this.  i know.  you're standin' on my mop.  at least let me help you with your work.  isn't there something i can do.  ..leave me alone so i can get on with it.  very well, but i shall be back.  come back about 6:00.  we can talk while i'm scrubbin' the walls.  and it is my considered opinion that if granny continues to do housework at this pace, she will end up in the hospital.  .  how can i.  did you see this morning's paper.  it's a tragedy.  oh, dear, did somebody pass away.  it's worse than that.  the stock market.  amalgamated muffin pan is down 1/4 of a point.  and you're crying aboutthat.  well, you'd cry too.  i lost $9.25.  well, how would you like to lose 73 million.  .  oh, you meanyou mean the clampett account.  ..aw, don't worry about granny.  she's stronger than both of us.  but she's working like a dynamo 20 hours a day.  working hard from dawn to dusk keeps people young, alive, vital.  in fact, i think i'll put in a health plan like that for my employees.  excuse us, mr. drysdale, miss jane.  hello there. mr. clampett, elly may.  what can we do for you.  well, miss jane, you was up at the house.  you seen granny doin' her housework.  well, i only saw her brfly.  when i was there, she was in a tizzy.  a tizzy, huh.  she's started cleaning things i've never heard of.  i beg your pardon.  i'm worried about granny's house chores.  she's gonna work her fingers right down to the bone.  yeah, and the rest of her's almost there now.  oh, isn't that a coincidence.  i was just telling miss hathaway how worried i was about granny working so hard.  i'm just sick about it.  i'm getting a little sick myself.  she's always doted on her housekeeping.  but here lately, uh, well, we're the only place in the neighborhood that gets its grass shampooed regular.  she don't even stop when she goes to bed.  she sleeps with her clothes under her mattress to press 'em.  i'm afraid she's gonna wear herself right down to a frazzle.  now, wasn't i saying that very thing )
