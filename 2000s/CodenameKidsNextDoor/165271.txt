for you.    you did.   i told the kids next door that trying out the new strain of unpoppable zit on your prom night was going too far.  ..you did that for me.  after all i've done to you and the kids next door.   well, you may be my archenemy, but you're still my sister.  now, come here.  let's see if this junk works.  eww. nasty.  those kids next door scientists do nice work, huh.      you know,

 have you made contact.   aah.   no one said anything about cruddy swimming on this mission.  i almost drownded down there.   well, where did you think we were going when we said it was a deepsea rescue.   deepsea rescue.  i thought you said "free seafood "  numbuh 4, put your sanitizationizing mask back on immediately.  you are in a highly kidtoxic zone, and you can't just  that tree house is infected with coogatidinal octooogie tetrainfecto epistreptococcus.   that better mean there's seafood in here, professor dorkinstein.  .  listen, you little trapezoidal crustaceous membrane, i'd like to 239 is trying to say is that during the recent attack by our archenemy cree, she released a highly contagious specimen codenamed '" your mission is to find this specimen and contain it so the scientists can safely return to the lab.   and whatever you do, keep your gear on at all times.  one touch from patient "c" could infect you and every kid you come in contact with.   exactly.  this is way out of our league, so i say we set that tree house to selfdestruct and be done with it.   are you crazy, numbuh 20,000.  if we lose that tree house, it'll set our research back eleventyhundreded years.   exactly.  you heard the doc, troops.  now switch your gear to hazmat mode and get moving.   copy that, numbuh 1.  numbuh 3 and i will search the upper level.  numbuh 2, you take seafoody over here and check the lower level.  activate hazmat mode.   let's go, pal.   cut it out.  whoa, whoa.  uhh, aah.   i'm telling you, we should ..now.   relax.  my team is the best there is.  they won't stop until they've "  hey, let's stop and get something to eat.   we can eat later, numbuh 4.  i don't want to be here any longer than i have to.   well, suit yourself.   lousy kids next door scientists.  they can figure out how to build a tree house underwater, but they can't rig a candy machine to work without quarters.  hey.  yeahehheheah.  ha ha ha ha.  oh, sweet mercy.  "   ahhhhhhh.   ahhhhh.  whew.   helloooooo.   don't do that.  i almost choked on my coco nutlog.  and, hey, what are you doing in this tree house anyway.  this place is supposed to be ..or something.   you're funny.   ..thanks.  ..kind of creepy.   will you be my boyfriend.   whoahohoho.  hold on there, girly girl.  i got to catch up to my mate up ahead because, you see, we're on a mission, you know, to find us " oh.  ..  ..   hey.  one of the return modules is firing up.   numbuh 2, is that you.  do you copy.   open the docking hatch.  numbuh 4 needs help now.   ewwww.   that's a negative, numbuh 2.  if you bring him in here, you risk infecting the whole ship.   a member of my team is in trouble.  we can't just leave him out there.  your scientists can help him, right.   well, we could possibly  good enough for me.   don't. you'll doom us all.   that's a chance i'll have to take.   don't worry, numbuh 4.  keep a stiff upper lip.  huh. aaah.    there.  clean as a whistle.   you're funny.   aaaaaaaaaaah.   the shuttle should be finished with decontamination right about now.  you see, gentlemen   report. report.  are we under attack.   it's patient "c".  she's aboard the ship.   she touched me.  help me.   get off of me.  now i have it.  i have it.  coursing through my veins.  gnawing. spreading.  diverticulinating.  ohhh.   we are all doomed.  we did it your way, and now this ship is infected just like the tree house.   well, just what do you i know everything in the whole wide world".   i say we set the ship on a collision course with the deepsea lab and send everything lock, stock, and barrel into the trenches.  that way, we know that patient "c" will never infect anyone ever again.  ..we'll all be...   that is a sacrifice i am willing to make.  .  there are 200 dorky boy scientists on this ship.  not to mention, my teammates are still in that tree house.   you're right.  i don't know what i was thinking.  how can you guys ever forgive me.  i know.  how's about we go down to the mess hall, and i buy you guys a soda.   say, that sounds pretty good.   make that two sodas, and you're on.   oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.  i want a bendy straw to drink mine.  yessiree, i love  numbuh 20,000.  what are you doing.   does this mean he's not buying us a soda.   i am doing what i should've done in the first place.    man.  why does every other kids next door tree house have all the free candy you want except this one.   there's plenty of coco nutlogs in that broken machine down there.   numbuh 5, you guys are in big trouble.   so, we took a couple of candy bars.  send us a bill.  numbuh 20,000 has gone off the deep end and is at the tree house to send us all into the trench.  you've got to get out of there.   well, what about you guys.   it's too late for us.  just worry about yourselves.   no way.  numbuh 5's got an idea.  come on.   this is for everyone's own good.  it is for the best.  i know i am right.   open this door, numbuh 20,000.  this is insane.   i told you.  my calculations show that shouting and banging on a door will not open it.    you're funny.   it's patient "c".  aah. aaah. aaah. aah.      aaaaaaaaaaaaah.    we're gonna do it.  we're gonna do it.  we will do it.   numbuh 20,000, turn this ship around.   no. let go.  can't risk infecting anyone else.   there's got to be another way.   we have tried everything.  let go.   numbuh 1, patient "c" is waaaaaah.   waaaaaaaah.   we're gonna hit.   aaaaaaah.   freeze.    helloooo.   don't touch her.  she's got coogatidinal octooogie tetrainfecto epistreptococcus.   say what.   you know, cooties.   uhhuh. uhhuh.   are you crazy.  this whole thing is about cooties.  there is no such thing as cooties, you fools.   sure there is.  look what it did to numbuh 4.   this is what happens when numbuh 4 is too stupid to remember that he is allergic to coconut.  let me guess.  coco nutlog.   mmhmm. mmm.   well, don't eat more.   she touched him.  she's got the cooties.    if i knew this was about something stupid like cooties, i never would've done what i did.  ..am...sorry.   it's all right.  i admire you for putting the kids next door organization's wellbeing above your own.   yeah.  that was a crazy thing to do, but it all worked out.  what.  oh, come on.  numbuh 5 told you there's no such thing as cooties.  ..yeah.    tell him.   ohhhoohoo.  oh, not you too.   ssorry, numbuh 5.  you can't be too careful.   can you believe this.  say  don't give me your cooties, numbuh 5. pressure can cause anyone's deodorant to fail.  introducing
