"rainbow monkey" this, "rainbow monkey" that.  i rue the day your mother ever bought that you that infernal toy and shattered the tranquility of our happy home.   now, khani, give them a chance to play with their toy.  a chance i never had as a child.  oh, what i would've done for a dolly.    oh, that doll is ruining my dinner.   exiled from the kids next door, mine is a solo journey.  a neverending quest to bring justice to kids worldwide.  ..the tommy.   okay, there, then.  uh, turkey, anyone.    oh, i'm sorry.  but the electricity has been giving us problems ever since tommy tried to wire his 2x4 technology generator.    aah.  pposh party rainbow monkey.  where'd it go.  it can't be gone.  it can't.  where is it.  .  i am sick and tired of this constant bickering.   i told you i should've taken that doll.   maybe left on its own lonely quest for justice.   you're not related to me, are you.   this is not happening.  this is not happening.    just relax, deary.  you wouldn't want a silly dolly ..  ..  funtime party.   okay, then.  why not have the first piece of my delicious turkey.    aaaaah.   oh, don't tell me you're a vegetarian or something.  i mean, it's just a turkey.  yah. aah.  i'm so fired.   fired, schmired.  where's the turkey.  i'm starvin' over here.   how can you talk about food at a time like this.    .  somebody here is guilty of rainbow monkey murder.  ..  until i discover who it is.   well, don't look at me.  i didn't do it.   or did you.   aah.    right. sorry.   hey, how come hoagie gets to be detective.   becausemykids next door training best qualifies me to get the facts.  for instance, where wereyou when the lights went out.  ..i went upstairs.  but i had nothing to do with the rainbow monkey.   you're hiding something.  spill it.    hey.  this was my candy and soda, you rotten stinker.  you stole this from my room.   ii'm sorry, hoagie.   why'd you do it, tommy.  ..i was...  thirsty.  no, no, no, no, no.  i was hungry.   that fish is three days old, and i ain't buyin' it.   now, look here, boy.   sit down.  sing, tommy.   i was thirsty.  ooh. i mean hungry.  aah.  i mean thirsty. aah.  i mean hungrthungry. hirsty.   i want the truth.   i was hungryandthirsty.   can't you understand.  ..of all important.  ooh.   can we please get on with this stupid dolly investigation.  i'm hungry here.   hungry for revenge.   no.  hungry for turkey, you crazy munchkin.  so i want some dinner.   well, i want some justice.  justice with a nice helping of confession on the side.  any one of you could've done the deed.  mom.     i heard you complain about the rainbow monkey ruining your dinner party.  forking that rainbow monkey in the back solved that problem, didn't it.   no.  oh, i mean yes.   i just wanted a nice dinner.   and what about you, grandma.  you're old and mean.   you got that right, sonny.  and i would've done it, too, if it wasn't for my back and my arthritis.  and i got this funny little crick in my neck.  oh, and my bunion.   and what about you, mr. sanban.  with the rainbow monkey gone, you wouldn't have to worry about your daughters' constant "   i just wanted my babies to be nice to each other.  is that so bad.  is that so wrong.    uh, all right.  just, you know, lighten up, already.  okay.   okay.  thank you.   and then there's you.  you were jealous of your daughter's dolly.  and we all know it's not a long trip from jealousy to forking a rainbow monkey in the back.   i bought that doll for my daughters.  it's theirs to do with as they please.  but did anyone offer me a turn with it.  a hug.  five minutes of rainbow monkey fun.  no.  not one little, bitty huggy wuggy.   but i didn't do it.  i was powdering my nose.   i knowyoudidn't do it.  ..  mushi.   you're kidding, right.   i don't kid.  sometimes i say cool jokes and puns and stuff.  but never kid.   but why would i do it.  kuki said she was gonna share the doll with me anyway.   maybe.  but perhaps you couldn't wait.  i mean, a posh party rainbow monkey is pretty special.  special enough to grab from your sister when the lights went out.  special enough to hug all by yourself.  but you forgot something.  the posh party rainbow monkey comes with careandshare sighing action.  and the second you hugged it, the rainbow monkey tried to let out a big sigh.  and that's when you realized the only way to save yourself was to silence it for good.  and then you hid the poor rainbow monkey, hoping nobody would find it.   i wouldn't do such a horrible thing.  i love rainbow monkeys.  i love sharing.   then perhaps you'd share your fork with me.   ..  oh, mushi.  .   because you kept hogging it.  and showing off its huggigaciousness.  it drove me nuts.   oh, mushi.  i should've shared more.   shared.  you don't get it, do you.  i wanted it all to myself.    mr. sanban, take her away.  i have a feeling mushi is gonna be grounded for a long, long time.   thank you for a most interesting evening.  but i think we'll just go get ourselves some pizza tonight.  i look forward to seeing you monday in your new office and deputy subaccounts manager.  well  thank you, madame head of accounting ma'am, sir, ma'am.   oh, thank you, mrs. sanban.   oh, please, call me genki.  and as for you, young detective, perhaps now you can investigate what happened to your mother's turkey.   maybe.  but discovering who ate a lemonbasted turkey with cranberry stuffing that won't be easy.    i don't recall your mother mentioning what kind of stuffing she put in the turkey.   well, yeah.  i never mentioned it.  , what .  ..  ooh. ii can explain.  it was  you ate my turkey, you little sherlock holmes.  take that.  and that. and that.  and that, too. )
