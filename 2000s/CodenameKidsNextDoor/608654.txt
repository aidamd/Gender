recently been confirmed babies don't just magically appear in hospitals.  they are systematically kidnapped by evil adults and then placed in socalled nurseries, where they're subjected to insidious experiments, turning them directly into adults and terminating their only chance at glorious childhood.  so, it's up to us to liberate these babies from the insidious adult laboratories.    wow.   hold on, kids.  you can't just go ohh.   oh.   dr. lumpkins, line one.    hey, what's the      that does it for crowd control.   what's going on.   numbuh 2, prepare for baby liberation in tminus 10

with a bunch of babies, anyway.   well, once numbuh 2 finishes forging their new identities, these babies will be set free and integrated back into kid society.  that way, they'll be free to experience all the fun of kiddom, instead of being a slave to the agechanging experiments of adults.   you really have no idea where babies come from, do you.   of course i do.  they come from baby eggs.   all right, listen.  i'm gonna tell you straight up.  babies come from   oh, nice, numbuh 5.  you've made them cry.   me.  fine.  you try and take care of them by yourself, then.   we will.
