hush has fallen over this capacity crowd at the 18th and final hole.  if puttkin can sink this hole, he'll win and restore proper order to the miniature golf universe.  if he misses, every ounce of

in one through the spinning windmill, it will activate my shrink ray, which will fire down the hole that runs to the center of the earth, and then the entire world will be shrunk to the size of a golf ball which will allow me, the great puttinsky, to play miniature golf .   oh, i love myself.  man, youarenuts.  there's no way i'm gonna take a shot that might shrink the world.  ohhoho.  youwon't be
