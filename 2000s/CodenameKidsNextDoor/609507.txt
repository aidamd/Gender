    how come everyone's afraid of us.   together: quick, dudes, into our mansion.  daddy, we're home.    oh, thank heavens, children.  i was so worried about my wee, little munchkins, you pretty, little  together: daddy, these little dudes are, like, totally fro the other side.    from where kids are free.   well, more free than here, that's for sure.  what happened to this world.   oh, it's the destructively nefarious kids.   they despise other children so much, they have forced them to do all the work.  kids are the garbage collectors, tv repairmen, and even lawyers.  they work and work while adults sit around eating candy and playing new video games, demanding bigger allowances.  my darling children do their best to stop them, but it's well, it's just it's not enough.    that's horrible.   we have to help you.   together: no way, dude.  you gotta totally get back to your world.  if the dnk have opened the portal, it means something terrible is about to go down.    aah. we'reeing attacked.  hide like cowards. yes.     together: you dudes gotta get out of here.   whoa.   i don't know how to thank you guys.   together: we'll hold them off, dude.  now go.  all right, dudes and dudettes, let's rock.   ugh. come on. hurry.    i didn't think we'd get out of that one.   you haven't.  by order of the one supreme ultra dnk leader, welcome to the worst day of your lives.   follow my lead.  what is your problem, soldier.  how dare you interrupt my topsecret mission for the supreme leader.  what do you think he'll do to you when he hears you tried to stop negative numbuh 1 from doing his job.  ..but uh.  you can't fool me.  we're supposed to be on the lookout for positive numbuh 1 and his girlfriend, and i say that's you two.   well, i say i'm negative 1 on urgent dnk business for the supreme leader himself.  so, maybe you're right.  maybe you're wrong.  but do you really want to take that chance.     come on, i don't have all day.  ..eizzil.  stand down. stand down.  sorry about the hold up.    that's more like it.  ..walk...okay, run.   there it is.   nigey, we made it.   yeah, i'm proud of you, lizzie.  you did a great job back there.   oh, thanks.    ready.   yeah.   together:..2 huh.   numbuh 1. lizzie.  where are you guys.   hey, something's coming up.          are you okay, numbuh 1.   oh, yeah. i'm fine.  ..fine.  . .  . .  . .  . .  wow.  i know.   new koolaid fun fizz.  drop it. watch it. drink it.       are you sure you're okay, numbuh 1.   i feel great.  your pool is most invigorating.  here, numbuh 4.  try it for yourself.   hey, whoa. whoa.   oh, no, you don't.   cut it out.   yeah, that ain't cool.   i don't wanna.  ..hey, i was only kidding.   so what.   yeah, friends don't do that.   he said he was kidding.   yeah, well, it ain't funny.  you know numbuh 4 can't swim.  ..say, why don't you ask numbuh 4 to help you with those negatronic doohickeys you were talking about, huh, nigey.   what are you oh, right.  come on, numbuh 4.  ..  .. the tree house.    what was that all about.    oh, man.   numbuh 2.   but ii didn't.  whoa.   aah.   eee.   i don't get it, numbuh 1.  why are we dismantling numbuh 2's energyenhancement grid.   well, 'cause that's what the leader told us to do, and it's not smart to anger him.   what.  ..   i think what numbuh 1 means is that it has something to do with these negatronic ion thingies, right.   oh, right, right.  what eizzil said.   lizzie.   i mean lizzie.  thanks, eizzil, that was so close.   hmm.  ah.   makes sense to me.   together: whew.   so, you want me to set these up by the city pool, right.   sorry we're late.   oh, hi, numbuh 3. huh.   wait a second.  you're not kuki.  you're some kind of negaversion of numbuh 3.   i thought you said he was the stupid one.   they can tell who people are in this world by looking at their eyes.   it's called being a friend.   yeah, like operatives have friends.   ..    hey, we don't need the runt anymore.  let's take him out.  that'd be cool, right guys.    shut up.   man, she is so annoying.   listen up, shorty.  i don't like you, but you've got spunk.  so, i'm gonna make an offer you'd be stupid to refuse.  you help us open a portal from your world to the negaverse using your city pool so we can grab every kid swimming in your world and force them to work in ours.  then we'll move on to the next pool and the next and the next until all your world's kids are ours to do with as the leader pleases.  or you can spend the rest of your life in the mines digging out broccoli with your bare hands.    let me get this straight.  you want me to betray my buddies .   you must be from another world.   you you can't talk back to to negative numbuh 3 like that.  i mean it.   well, what are you waiting .  let's dance.     why are you doing this.    a simple reason, really.  i'm evil.  .   oh, this. it's my goatee.  it makes me look eviler.   no, it makes you look dumber.   yeah, that thing should be called a nastee.  i got one. i got one.  okay, wait.  you should give that back to the goat you stole it from.   please, man, you are hopeless.   you know, i bet the negative numbuh 2 is really funny.    silence.  i'm supposed to be torturing you guys here.   believe me, that peach fuzz is torture.    guards, bring me my toys.  i'm going to dump four of you into my broccoli mines, but one lucky kid won't have to go.  to decide who, each of you will be given a weapon and armor and then taken to the arena to battle against one another.  ha. hoo. ha. ha.  the winner will have the honor of becoming my bestest personal bodyguard.   but, sir, i'm your bestest personal bodyguard.   shut up, you.  this is my world, and i'll use you until i'm done with you.  so, who wants to battle for a .   you don't get it, do you, goatboy.  not one of us would ever join up with someone who rules by fear.   aaah.  at least i do rule.  send these pathetic losers to the mines.   eee.   you don't have to do as he says, negative numbuh 86.  you're nicer than this.  i can tell.   you don't know what he's capable of.  and once he controls the kids from your e'll be unstoppable.   all the more reason to stop him now.   what's taking them so long over there.  those idiots are looking at a oneway trip to the broccoli mines if they don't set up this portal before adult swim.  finally.    someone's coming.     my greatest warriors defeated.  but that's unpossible.  ..   okay, numbuh 4.  you took care of those d.n. creeps easily.  you can do this.   ugh.   cannonball.   oh, ugh.  huh. positive numbuh 4.   as in positively gonna kick your butt.   well, i must be a genius, 'cause you're an idiot to come here.  you're completely surrounded by my troops.   well, if you're my opposite, then that makes you a coward.   what.   what did he say.   i don't know.  ..i don't know what you're ttttalking about.   i don't use a bunch of bullies to protect me.   ii'm nnnot afraid of you.   oh, yeah.   no. guards. open fire.   no.  i don't know about you kids, but i'm tired of this tired of being afraid, tired of cowering, tired of pretending what i'm doing isn't wrong.  ..to be a pretty princess instead.   she's definitely numbuh 86's opposite.   i want to pet my very own pony.   yeah, i want to ride my bike.   and play video games.   eat candy.   what.  negatives 1, 2, 3, and 5, don't just stand there.  do something.   check it out, negative numbuh 5, a coward with a goatee.   either there's a farm around here, or you stink.    that's not funny.  that's not funny at all.   i'll show you.  i'll take over your world, and you'll be sorry.  you'll all be sorry.   ya. whoohoo.   i guess we've got more in common with you than we thought.  still, why did you let negative numbuh 4 go to your world.   oh, i got a feeling he won't like it there.    a new world.  a whole new world to conquer.  i think this is gonna be a positive experience for me.   oh.   get off my friend's world.  yaow. ugh.  oh, crud.   so, have a great time at your broccoli mine, shorty.   so, how can we help you guys, eizzil.   you guys have done enough already.  now that kids aren't afraid of that bully anymore, it's up to us to make this world a better place for everyone.   it'll be hard work, but we can do it.   together: together.  sorry we're late, dudes, but we were just making some new friends.   come on, y'all.  let's get out of here before people start hugging and junk.   oh, wally, i was so proud of you.  you can swim now.   hey, yeah, i guess i can.    well, eizzil, that was a real adventure.  hey, your
