uno, what do you say to allegations that you eat paste.   nigel, are you wearing rainbow monkey undies.   is it true you're a homeworkeating werewolf.   this is ridiculous.  numbuh 1 is totally getting the chewed end of the pencil on this.   don't worry.  we brought in 50anhour to defend him.  he is gooooood.  and he's a fifthgrader.   he'd better be good at a buck 50 an hour.  that's like my whole week's allowance.   i told you we'd pay you back.   all rise for the honorable delightful presidents from down the lane.    no way.  who made you ballot burglars a judge.  this is an out
