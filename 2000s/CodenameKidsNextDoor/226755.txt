tried to trick out the prom.  this is gonna be explosive.  dude, can i just tell you how it's like my thumbs were specifically created to hit those keys.  do you realize our parents didn't even have cell phones at our age.  dude, what if we traveled back in time, way before cell phones ever existed, and tried to text.  how far back are we talking.  oh, dude, i'm talking caveman.    we're kicking it old school for a stone age experiment to see if we can text as cavemen using two techniqueson rock, dude what would happen since cavemen didn't have wireless and s text, this experiment calls for and ali to carve a text as quick as possible and then throw the message to my caveman buddy.  first text delivered successfully and read by me, wins, 'cause i'm the smart dude.  i'm thinking about taking the arrowhead to text onto the rock.  no, no, no. don't use it.  why.  it's mine. mine, mine, mine.  arrowhead mine.  everybody knows cavemen didn't have rock, paper, rock, rock, rock for winner. rock, rock, rock, club.  ali can have the arrowhead to carve into the rock because it's going to be much easier to use this tusk to carve into wood my arrowhead is gonna be like a piece of chalk line right on that rock.  beat on this what are we gonna write.  i was just about to ask you that.  to make it fair, we're both i'm 's carving brb.  and, of course, the messages legible so even a caveman can read it.  ready.   yes.  tribute, sparkle, phoenix.   what is this, a baby tooth.  it's not as easy as it looks.  i started to use the back of the arrowhead, and it worked.  now i had to send the text, and i had to hit the caveman.  hah. he caught the message.  ] he caught the message.  dude, i wonder if cavemen wore cups.  hah. he caught the message.  i wrote it, i delivered it, and now if jackson can read it, i take home the cavemantexting prize. what's it say.  707.   turn it over.  lol.   we did it. we invented texting for cavemen.   i lol you. lol.  you guys smell.  since we're talking back in time, what other historical dudes needed texting.  george washington carver.  colonial dudes like george washington.   oh.  yeah, dude, and they were all about boats.  we need to figure out a way for the colonial dudes to text from shore to ship.  yeah.  what if we used carrier pigeons.  dude, the only language those guys understood was cannonballs.   this is beautiful.  we have our aircompressed colonial cannon.  and we're gonna use these cannonballs right here and text the enemy that they need to honestly, you're gonna have to stop playing with my ponytail.  it's very galiant.  ] dude, what would happenso we have to text them "surrender" in text languagebut we only have 10 cannonballs to get our message do you think it's gonna work.  it's not too hard to send over an arch and then to land on the there's lots of distance between us and the so if we aim correctly, the cannonballs will land right on deck. perfect text.  we're using an aircompressed cannon, so i think the text will go flying right by the ship.  text a n i say that when we text the ship, our cannonballs will go straight through the bow right that would send a message.  let me make mine big right here. all right.  in the pursuit of happiness, let's just fire this thing.   here we go.   ahoy. fire.    it landed right in there.  direct hit. message sent.  i was right.  lab dudes, lower the i wanna go straight through the hole.  do not fire until you see the whites of their eyes.  look at me.   you missed.  " we need it to hit right in the poop deck.   fire.   ohh.  we've already shot three balls, and they've only received " we still need to get this isn't looking good.  so i asked the lab dudes to lower the cannon 10 degrees.  raise it up five degrees.   ready.   fire.  they just weren't getting the so we had the lab dudes readjust cannon's position and set us up for rapid fire.  there's no way they won't get the message now.  i vow this now.   r.   whoa.   n.   fire. d.   r.   dude, they got the left.  let's try to sink this ship and really send them a message.  .   how did that happen.  coming up next, explosive musica hawk crushes itand limo prom destruction.  look.  it's the shrine of the selfish fruit master.  yum.  hoi. if you want my delicious froot loops cereal, you'll have to defeat my kung fu style. )
