 city.  they're gonna miss the big finale.      aah.   hmm.  yes.  i did it.  i amhe bestest, bestest, bestest dodgeball player in the entire world.   whoohoo, mama.  break it down.  go, wizard, go, wizard, go, wizard.  oh, yeah.     no.  that's unpossible.  it cannot be.  aah.       do you suppose dinner's as good as the show.   i hope so, dear.  i'm as hungry as a wombat.     you broke my nose.  i'm telling my mom.   i showed him the door.  told you it's in my blood.   yeah, but  no, don't say anything.  i can't help it if i'm great.     aw, would you look at that.  my baby bro wants some tips on how to play dodgeball from the master.  aah.   numbuh 4.  does anyone have a chili dog.  ..  .. buhbye.  ..  look out. ha ha.  ..  you'll want to chase that taste down.  kids love me. you.  up and away.  ..  see you there, lollygagger.  ..  that's always... both: the winnamon.  the cinnamontastic partof a nutritious breakfast.  kids: awwww.  so little time,so many bowls.  here it comes.  the first cupcake cereal ever.  . new cupcake pebbles, party in a box .  mmmmmm.  . tastes yummy like a cupcake .  . makes you want to rock .  new post cupcake pebbles.  part of a good breakfast.  . party in a box. . yum yum.    together:  finally, with this last piece of the puzzle, we can break the magerific code and achieve our greatest desire.    well, guess what.  our greatest desire is to achieve the world's record for kicking you creeps in the pants, so hand over that tablet before we go for the gold.   together: if it isn't the kids next door.  what an unpleasant surprise for you, that is.   oh.   aah.     together: we'd love to stay here on rainbow monkey island with you kids next doubt, but you guys are the pits.    i love it when they make big, fat, stupid targets like  no.  you might hit the tablet.   numbuh 3 is right.  you guys get back to the ship, and i'll take care of the delightful children personally.   together: keep still, you pest.   i'll stand still long enough to  together: come on, nigey.   can't break the tablet.   together: what the what are you  hyah.  numbuh 5, come in.  i have the tablet.  listen carefully.  the code is  whoo.   together:     is that part of the code.  hey, numbuh 1.     kids next door enormous lumbering electric pachyderm helps instigate nail bitingly daring emergency rescues.   come on. hurry.  he's been on this island for, like, forever and a half.   and he's got the code.   hold on.  picking up something.  ..that way.   all right.  stampede action activated.     stop.  ..   numbuh 1.  he's evaporated.   and he's the only one who saw the code.   knock it off, you two.  numbuh 1 just took his clothes off, that's all.  the only question is why.   uh, i got another question.  what are we gonna do about them.  run.   oh, no.    aah.   ..   numbuh 1.    ..hey, there, numbuh 1.     ..  uh, nice leaves you're wearing.  they're, uh, very jungley.    whoohoo.   hey. hey.  cut it out. quit.  stop it.   numbuh 5 says we get numbuh 1 off this island before he starts kissing us and stuff.  yech.   well, the first thing that we'll have to do is appoint a new leader for your sector.   who cares who's leader.  we need to get numbuh 1 back to his old self.   we have rules, numbuh 3.  all sectors must have a leader, even if it's temporary.   ooh. ooh. ooh.  ooh. ooh. ooh.   don't look at me.  been there, done that, not doing it again, especially after you know what happened.   of course, numbuh 5.  .   me. me. me. me. me.   i know.  ..you, numbuh 2.   i don't know.  leaders don't get to pilot their own ships.  i'll pass.   oh, please.  please, please.  oh, please, please.   hmm.  are you sure, numbuh 2.   absotively posilutely.   well, i guess i'll have to figure out who it should be.  now, let's see.  okay, that decides it.  ..  numbuh 3.   me.  okay.  first mission is get numbuh 1 back so he can tell me that code.   numbuh 1 knows the code.  for the love of all that's pure and sacred, why didn't you say so.  all right, geniuses, i want nigel uno cured now.   we're doing the best we can, but a boy's physiology isn't built to withstand such prolonged exposure to sharing, caring, and rainbowrific love.   do i look like i care.  i want that code now.   i'm sorry, but that's the best fourthgrade biology can do.  239, we could always use  no.  don't even think about trying that.   why not.  the effects of element  no.  that might keep him apeified for life.   it can work.   listen, you mitoplasmic cerebellamoid, i'm the boss here.   says who.  i'm in the fifth grade and .   the fourth grader started it, right, numbuh 275.   now, what are you yammering on about.  562 is suggesting that we use element "  it's dangerous, but we might be able to shock him back to his normal persnickety self.   but element "l" is totally unstable.  we don't know what the shock will do to him, so pbht.   sure, it's risky, but not doing anything is worse.  pbht.     do it.   you heard the girl.    in your face.   fine, but we're not taking any chances here.  i want everyone behind the barriers before element "l" is introduced.     lizzie, it's up to you.  pour it on.   iii just want i want my nigey back.   how's that.   thatagirl.     nigey. oh, my.     we have to abort.  abort.   it's too late.   aah.  no. stop.  nigey, get off me.  oh, you're all slimy.  stop, nigey.  no. stop.  on second thought, i think i prefer this nigey.   we've failed.   you see now the hubris of honors prescience.  numbuh 1 is apeified for life.   it's not my fault.   it's totally your fault.   now numbuh 1 will be like that forever, and we'll never know the code.    i don't get it.  what's so important about this dumb code.   what's so important.  the rainbow monkey corporation is having a contest, and whoever breaks the superhappy code of sharon wins a free key chain.  .  you mean to tell me that i risked my life, endangered my team, and spent valuable kids next door resources so you could .  being a kids next door operative is serious business.  it's not a stupid key chain hunt.   he's back.   good to be back and all but stop hugging me already, seriously.  you're messing up my leaves.   oh, well.  it was nice while it lasted.    together: oh, goody, goody.  our key chains have arrived.   hey, guys.   together: huh.   do you mind if my friends come over to play.   together: aah.    up.  the for honey nut cheerios will finally be mine.  not if i can help it, yellow jacket.  ugh...keep him busy boys i don't think so.  ugh. mmmmmm.  ugh. yummy. yummy.  well that backfired a little bit.  i'll get that honey yeeeeeeeeeeeet.   the honey is safe this time...  ...for honey nut cheerios.  part of this good breakfast.
