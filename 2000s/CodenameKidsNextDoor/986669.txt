leona.  you haven't figured it out yet.  regardless now that she's led us to the fountain, she's all yours.  but what do you want with the fountain.  to destroy it, of course.  this fountain is a menace to everything adults stand for.  the ultimate goal of every child should be to grow up.  if other kids found out about this fountain, they might be tempted to drink from it and be young forever.  and we can't let that happen.  haven't you dorks wastedh of my day without yammering on about nothing.  i think it's time i checkyou into the atomic headlock hotel.  splendid.  could you

aaaah.   swirly's corporate office.   come on, hurry.  we gotta get her into that fountain.   oh, leona.  ..  still kinda homely. eww.  hold on.  if leona needs the fountain to be young again, ..  an adult.  you're right, nigel.  300 years ago, i stumbled upon this ancient school, and found this fountain.  by drinking its sparkling waters, i discovered that i could remain a kid forever.  but sssadly, the fountain's effects are temporary, so i could never travel much farther than the school above.  so i've relived the fourth grade, moving from homeroom to homeroom over and over again, to hide my eternal 10yearoldness.  but it's been worth it to not have to grow up.  it was my gloriousss secret until those delightful children ruined it.  so from the bottom of my heart thank you for saving me, kids next door.  too bad i have to dessstroy you now.   hey, numbuh 1, i could have sworn leaky leona just said,  i have to dessstroy...  hey, what's the big what.   what's happening to .  you're getting younger.  i'll make you all so young that you'll cease to exist.  noooo.   kids next door.       no one can know about my fountain.  not even you, kids next door.   how about one more shot, baby.  heeyaw.   stop it, leona. you can't do this.  i want to be young forever, abigail.  the more people who know about the fountain of youth the more people will try to destroy it.  but we don't want to destroy the fountain.  we're your friends.  we just want to help you.   i'm sssorry, abigail.  but i can't take that chance.  leona, what you're doing is wrong.  ..i...  i know.  oh, no. stop.  no.   leona, please.  ..sorry.  you big baby.  pbht.  one more blast should do it.  goodbye, kids next door.   no.  you're dead.  my precious fountain.  ohohoh.   this mission is over, guys.

yeah, you should have.  i thought you said we came here to save leona.  change in plans.  she's an adult and a jerk.  but she wants to be a kid.  " that's our job.    ..  battle stations.   ohwhaha.    ahaaaah.  gotcha.   oh.   .    yeah. yeah.  now let'sall get out of here.  thanks again for saving my life, kids next door.  leona.  ..  without the fountain.  ..  you know.  it's okay.  i've been a kid for longer than most people have been alive.   now go on.  you kids better get to class.  oh, here.  numbuh 5 almost forgot about these.  thanks, abigail.  thanks for everything.  ohh. ohh.  are you sure you'll be okay.  don't worry about me. i'll be fine.  just fine.    yay.   la la la la la    captions by vitacwww.vitac.com captions paid for bycartoon network )
