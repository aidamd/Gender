  uhoh.    numbuh 1.   all: attack.      hey, he blew up.   not quite.   hey.   this elf was born, quite strangely, with a weird and wooden head.

will you show me.   sure.   this elf got pelted by a radioactive snowball while walking home from santa's christmas eve.  now, you can say there's no such thing as superpowers, but once you meet snow angel, you'll believe.   wow.  you reallycancontrol snow.  hey, that's not for you.   numbuh 2, look out.     white christmas.  what have we here.   let go, you frostbitten freak.     and last, but

all right.   just kidding.   aahhaaah.   aaaah.    now, does anyone else want to .   all: no, no.   let's go.  just keep it.    hate to do this to you, kid, but we're running out of time here.    only once in a thousand christmases is elfa strike forced to pull out their most deadly attack.  when there's no other way to save the most wonderful time of the year, they call in the "12 days of christmas" attack.  12 drummers drumming.  11 pipers piping.  10 lords aleaping.  9 ladies dancing.  8 maids amilking.  7 swans aswimming.  6 geese alaying.  5 golden rings.  4 calling birds.  3 french horns.  2 turtledoves.  and a partridge in a pear tree.     thanks, kid.  now, if you kids don't mind, we'll be taking back the reindeer you stole so we can get on delivering presents.   i didn't steal it.  i bought it for numbuh 4.   yeah.  and just what is your stupid friend gonna do with a secret santa surprise reindeer monkey.   you got me a cruddy rainbow monkey.   well, it's more than you got her.   how doyouknow i didn't get her anything.   the secret santa surprise reindeer monkey is only available at the rainbow monkey superstore on christmas eve.   then these kids couldn't have been at the north pole today if they got one.   well, no kidding.  we were at that crazy store all day, waiting in line to buy that thing.   then if they didn't do it, then who has the reindeer.   together:  so, ..  shall we begin.  to.  finding everything okay.  i work for a different insurance company.  my auto policy's just getting a little too expensive.  with progressive, you get the "name your price" option, so we build a policy to fit your budget.  wow. the price gun.  .  wish we had this.  we'd just tell people what to pay.  yeah, we're the only ones that do.  i love your insurance.  bill.  tom.  hey. it's an office party.  the freedom to name your price.  only from progressive.  call or click today.  ..shall we begin.   if it isn't the delightful children from down the lane.  come to pick up your coal in person this year.   oh, no.  this year is going to be different.   oh, you're going to be good little children instead of evil, conniving brats.   wearegood children better than every other snotnosed kid in the world.  and this year, we're going to prove it by getting all the presents, while everyone else gets nothing but coal.  and all we have to do is use your reindeer to do it.   dohohohon't even try it.  no one but i can handle the reindeer.  it'd roast your little brains like chestnuts on an open fire.   how hard can it be.    grrrrrr.  i said don't.  you have no idea what kind of power you're playing with.   as long as there's power, we're happy.   doon't do iiit.   so, let's see what's under the tree this year.   so, you thought santa still used a regular old sled and reindeer, eh, christmas fans.  well, since old kringle's not getting any younger, he's getting more high tech, with the reindeer present delivery system, cybernetically linked to the christmas trees of every child worldwide.  all he has to do is decide whether they've been naughty or nice, and he can instantaneously send them the toys they've earned or the coal they deserve.   so, let's decide who's been ..  and who's been naughty.   ..huh.  sacre bleu.       all right, freaks.  step away from the sleigh.   oh, hello, kids next door.  is it time for your lesson already.   we don't need a lesson to kick your butts under the mistletoe, delightful deviants.   oh, i think our teacher would beg to differ.   that'ssubstituteteacher.   all: huh.   and just who the kringle are you.   eeexactly.  you christmas freaks think you're the only holiday in the world.  it's always, "here comes " well, did you ever think of celebrating substitute teachers' .   there's a holiday for substitute teachers.  .  that is exactly what i'm talking about.  but no matter, because the delightful children from down the lane and i miss edna jucation, official representative of substitute teachers' day have chosen a lesson plan where we eliminate christmas except the part where the delightful children get presents, of course therefore leaving substitute teachers' day as the most important holiday in the world.   what about groundhog day.   or the 4th of august that's pretty important.   i love flag day.   eenough.  this class is dismissed.   don't think santa's the only holiday guy with a superpowered force, kids.  ..  featuring the mighty ..  and the unintelligible tutor.     aah.    don't forget the human text.   grrrr.   and last but not least, the incredible mister physically fitastic.   we'll take care of these holiday hooligans.  you kids take care of the delightful children before christmas is over.   how do we get in.  the door's bolted shut.   down the chimney, of course.  now, get going.   aaah.    yay. toys, toys, toys.  huh.    huh.     huh.    okay, for the last time, out of the   help us.  please, you must help us.   ugh.   owee.   all right, lady, your class is dismissed.  now, open that door before we put a holiday hurting on you.   yyyou sstay away from me.  don't make me call the arbor day avengers for backup.   well, that's one bunch of kids that won't be getting presents this year.   would you knock it off about not getting presents around numbuh 3.   hey, whereisnumbuh 3.   wooow.  this thing can deliver presents to every kid in the world.  imagine, i could give even more presents to my friends.  yeah.  lots and lots of presents.  ..me.  everyone's always like, "oh, i forgot to get numbuh 3 a present," or, "i was off " well, i deserve something for being the only one to think of others.  i deserve everything.  yeeeees.   kuki.  we got to save her.   is there trouble, kids.   all: santa.   see.  that isexactlywhat i'm talking about.   there's only one way to save your friend, wallabee.   and you're the only one who can do it.   mmme.   you know what to do.  now, get in there.   are you sure there's not another way.   do you think i'd be sending youin there if there was another way, kid.   yeah, go.    numbuh 3.  kuki.  um, kuki.     aah.  uh, merry christmas, kuki.    you.  you got
