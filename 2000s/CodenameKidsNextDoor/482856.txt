 you," kid/teen treaty.    yes, fellow kids next door.  i understand your concerns, but i, numbuh infinity, assure you that the teen diplomats have vowed their utmost sincerity in this matter.   tell that to my older brother after he promised not to give me an atomic wedgie.    yes, yes, but there is much preparation to be done, and i assure you i will be available after the meeting if you have any questions.    that was his polite way of " kids next door dismissed.    a treaty with the teenagers.  ridiculous.  it has to be a trap.  numbuh infinity, may i have a word with you.    you've got to be kidding me.  i've worked too hard to be doublecrossed like this.   you know it was not my decision.  they just told me to tell you.   tell him what.   numbuh 1.  thank goodness you're here.  this teenager broke into my office and attacked me.   you.  come here, you.   huh.      numbuh infinity, are you okay.   excellent work, numbuh 86.  but your job is only half done.  arrest that boy.

call me the gofish under the couch cushion.  is our friend under there.  is your friend loose change.  this is him.  handsome kid, never saw him.  come on, we got to keep looking.  hey, don't give up hope.  never.  come back if you're looking for the tv remote.  goldfish crackers.  always baked and made with real cheese.  . the snackthat smiles back .  goldfish.  savingon the stuff you want your

another pantry filled.  and another great dayfor the savers.  save money. live better.walmart.  tme.for what.   numbuh 1 and chad were working together to ruin the treaty.   you're lying.  hey, get off of me.  it's you who's working with chad.  i saw you.   take them to kids next door arctic prison.  i will not have anyone, kid or teen, get in the way of peace.  .  you better not be saying that just to get us to stop eating your ice cream.   it's true.  both chad and numbuh 1 were arrested.  they're being flown to arctic prison any minute now.  and stop eating my ice cream.  we won't have enough for the aftertreaty luncheon.   let's go, traitor scum.  move it.    oooh, nice bracelet.   get off.   numbuh 1, what happened.   i caught infinity planning something with chad, and now he's trying to frame me.   why would he do that.   the only thing i can figure is that he's one of the splinter cell and is working with the teens to set a trap at the signing.  you've got to warn numbuh 362.   but what about you.   these two are going on an allexpensepaid trip to kids next door arctic prison.  contact your travel agent or commit high treason if you'd like to join them.   it appears your position has been compromised.  you should return to base.   no.  the treaty must go as planned.    what are you and infinity up to.  tell me.   listen, uno, the absolute last person i want to be handcuffed to right now is you.  and the only thing keeping me from knocking your block off is that i don't want to drag your unconscious butt around when i bust out of here.   and just where do you think you're going.   to stop that treaty.   huh.   and, unfortunately, wherever igo,yougo.  now, if you don't mind, it's time to rock.    aaah.  turn it off.   she's breaking up.   aaaaaaaah.  we've lost her.  eject, eject.   um, arctic prison.  yes, we're going to be a wee bit late.    yo, check it out.   no, no, no.  i will not hear another word.   what do you think that's about.   maybe he's asking for an extra serving of ice cream at the treaty luncheon.   or 48 flavors is part of the splinter cell, too.  come on.  we'd better go find numbuh 362 fast.   that was brilliant, chad.  any other ways of getting us killed, aside from crashing our ship into a mountain.   well, at least i got us out so i can stop that treaty.  aah.   and what makes you think i'll help you do that.   because it's a trap, genius.   aaaah.  well, of course it's a trap, but then why wouldyouwant to stop it.  unless you're being doublecrossed, as well.  of course.  this splinter cell's goal is to rid the world of all adults, so it would make sense to include you teenagers, as well.   brilliant deduction.  now will you shut your yap.  we're here.   a minimart.  well.  i'msoglad you got us here.  now we can stock up on microwave burritos and slushees.   just sit down.   oh, that's an evenmore brilliant idea.  hanging out in a parking lot will get us to the gihugecarrier real fast.   i said sit down and shut up.   both: whoa.    numbuh 362.  we got to talk to you.   of course, numbuh 5.  what's wrong.   it's numbuh infinity.  ..   wondering why you and your teammates aren't on your way to the gihugecarrier.   oh, right.  uh, well, we just have to talk to numbuh 362.  afterthe treaty.   uh, no.  we want to talk now.   or perhaps you would like to join your illustrious leader at the arctic prison.   uh, no, thanks.   we'll just see you at the treaty.  come on, y'all.  your honor you got to keep cocoa puffs away from me.  but, but why.  it turns everything chocolaty, and they make me go cuckoo well they're munchy... ohh and crunchy... ahh what's wrong with that.  i call my first and ooonly witness...  cocoa puffs.  chocolate in the court.  see, i'm cuckoo for cocoa puffs, cuckoo for cocoa puffs.   chocolaty cocoa puffs, part of a good breakfast.  i find you guilty, of being delicious.  .   on your feet, princess.   aah.  whoa.  where are we.   secret teenager hideout.  there's one beneath every minimart.   really.   of course.  why else would teenagers hang out in boring parking lots.  and speaking of "boring," i'm cutting you loose so i can stop that treaty without your whiny butt.  but first, i'm gonna pound the tuna salad out of you for taking what should be mine.   taking what.   yo, chad, what are you doing here, dude.  ..what's up, guys.  aren't you supposed to be on your way to the treaty.   hey, is that a dumb kid.  ..yeah.   you know the penalties for telling some stupid kid about our secret hideouts.   who are you calling stuwhoa.  whaaaaaa.   come on.  we're getting out of here.     hey.  get him.   honored participants, i would like to begin this historic day by not greeting you as kids or teenagers, but as youth, for that is what we truly are.  and united in this youth, we are here to erase the jagged line between kids and teenagers in order to make us one in our nonadulthood.  thank you.  and now it is my honor to welcome the leader of the teenagers in this historic event.  ..  the steve.     what.     where.     oh, yeah the treaty.  right.  it's cool.  i just thought we were stopping to get some tacos or something before we came here, you know.  i swear.  there's gonna be tacos at this luncheon thing, right.   yes, sir.   and ice cream, too.   and ice cream.   cool.  rock 'n' roll.    excuse me, but isn't the idea toavoidgetting hit.  you'reabout to get hit if you don't put a sock in it.   attention, teenage aircraft.  this is kids next door restricted airspace.  stand down or get shot down.   no way, man.  those dudes we're chasing stole my bro's bike.   get out.  kids next door squadron, open fire on those bikenappers.   great now we've gotboth sides after us.  let me fly this hunk of junk.    and now the signing of the kid/teen treaty shall commence.   shall we.   duuuude.  you know, before we do this thing, the steve would like to play a little song that my band wrote for just such an occasion.    what.  is it that bad.  'cause, like, none of us can hear it.  we teens are wearing protective earplugs, baby.   but what about the treaty.  ow.   don't you get it.  we, like, totally, burned you like little, ittybitty pieces of toast.  see, that's not my band playing.  that's just some junk our science nerds came up with to, like, destroy you all.  whoa.  dude, check it out.  laser light show.   that's no light show.     kids next door battle stations.    no.  it wasn't supposed to happen like this.   hyah.  plug that into your amplifier, baby.  huh.   hey, guys.  infinity's getting away.     dude.  what's the idea of trashing my totally awesome plan.  i'm gonna, like, totally  no.  that kid is mine.     going somewhere, numbuh infinity.   i waii was just going to get help.   you'll need help, all right help patching your butt together after we kick it into a million pieces for selling us out to the teenagers.   no.  i had no idea they'd doublecross us.  i was trying to  don't move.   unh.   i have had it with you.  ..   you think you know everything.  well, you  whoooooa.    you heard me.
