 ai  see. i told you guys.  the one thing i hate more than adults teenagers.  it's a good thing we found out about their sick little plan.  so, what are you and meg doing friday night.  oh, not much. just going up to the point.  cool. i'm going, too.  cool. who with.  hmm.  ..  can i help you with anything.  aaahh. aaahh.  but, julie, everyone goes up to the point.  f we go up to the point, it'll change us forever.  come on. please.  okay.  all right.   ow.  rotten teenagers.  so, guess what, guys.  my boyfriend is finally taking me to the point.   you're so lucky.  and i'm so jealous.  all: excuse me.  aaahh.  uhh.  my older brother said the point is where he finally became an adult.  yeah, you go up that mountain a boy and come back down a man who hey.  uhoh.  whoa.  hmm.  teenagers they make me sick.  wow. that's a lot of cars.  yeah, every teenager in town must be up there.   ext doorld allhose cruddy teenagers possibly be doing up there.  isn't it obvious.  actually, no.  don't be so naive, numbuh 5.  teenagers can't wait to grow up so they can really boss us around.  so somewhere up on the point, the teenagers, in league with the adults, have constructed a supersecret facility where they do the most disgusting thing imaginable.  they transform those dumb teenagers into into fullgrown adults, adults bent on ruining the lives of kids like us everywhere.  so, as the kids next door, it's our duty to locate the exact coordinates of that factory and then use our kids next door condiment kannon to wipe that fiendish factory right off the map with a single mustardy blast.  then those stupid teenagers are going to have to wait years to become big, stupid adults.  wow, i never would have figured that's what they were up to.  so, if we don't take out the factory, the town's adult population'll practically triplify, and there goes the neighborhood.  not if we stop them.  kids next door, let's move out.  whoa.  let's start with that one.  right.  once we capture one of those teenagers, they'll tell us where the factory is.  freeze. freeze. freeze. freeze.  aah. aah. aah. aah.  oh, man, that's nasty.  gross.  how can they dothatin a car.  ew. ew. ew.   cool.  what are you guys so grossed out about.  cheese fries always taste better after a couple of days.  ah, you're crazy, numbuh 2.  hmm. mmm. i take that back.  they're not better, but pretty darn good.  what did i tell you.  hmm.  so, where are the teenagers.  good question, numbuh 5.  kids next door, spread out and find those teenagers.  follow me.   marty, i'm scared.  but, julie maybe i'm not ready for this yet.  aw, don't worry.  it'll be fun, i promise.  we just go down there, and then the fun really starts.  ..okay.  and besides, everybody's doing it.  stupid teenagers.  they've led us right to the entrance of the factory.  send the coordinates to the condiment kannon, and we'll show those adult wannabes what happens when you mess with the kids next door.  super preposterously large orbiting rocketcondiment kannon.  kannon set to mustard and t minus 2 minutes to firing.  good work, numbuh 2.  now let's get out of here before that thing goes off.  man: aren't you guys a little
