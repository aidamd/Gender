it's finally here.  it's amazing what you can order off the internet these days, fido.    megan: oh, i can't wait to check out the school fair.  i'm so ready for the yummy food and the fun games.   tony: that's right, little guy.  tonywony's gonna love you, love you, love you.   lee: okay, that's way weird.  could you be any more embarrassing and babyish, bro.   marc: agreed.  uh, you want to explain why you're conversing with a piece of dust, t.   tony: it isn't dust.  it's lint.  and since mom and dad won't let me have a real pet, fuzzy's all i've got.   megan: come on, tony.  i'm sure if you tell them you really want one, they'll change theiminds.   lee: uh, news flash, megan.  tony doesn't exactly have a good track record when it comes to pets, remember.  or have you forgotten the stray cat he brought home who thought marc's head was a ball of string.  or the iguana that decided it liked your bed better than its cage.  or the goat that ate my homework andthe family car.   megan:  you're right, lee.  tony's pet days have gone the way of the dodo bird total extinction.   tony:  fuzzy, no.  whoa.  i can't believe jerry just blew my pet away.   marc: and i can't believe you "   jerry: good morning, spies.  so glad you could make it.   tony: did we have a choice.   jerry: of course not.  anyway, i have an unusual assignment for you.   megan: really.  you mean regul unususu unusualunusual.   jerry: actually, it's the latter.  observe.  in addition to a cold front moving into the pacific northwest and a lowpressure system forming over the mediterranean, there have been sightings of strange creatures all over the globe.   lee: uh, what kind of strange creatures, jer.   jerry: creatures that don't meet the classification of any known species and apparently like to attack people.   marc: in that case, why don't we segue right into the gadgets.  and make sure they're good ones, sir.   jerry: very well.  today you'll be using the polarblast ray gun, which, due to its mach6 firing speed, emits a breeze so chilly it's guaranteed to freeze villains in their tracks.   marc: cool.  no pun intended.   jerry: the supersonic whistle at an earsplitting 300 decibels.   tony: awesome.  i can't wait to  jerry: i'm sure you would.  but its effects are too potent for casual use.  in fact, it comes with its own supersonic earplugs.  and last but not least, fresh from the woohp laboratory, a pair of lightspeed shin guards.   megan: ooh.  humanpowered transportation.  i'm sure they're great for the environment.   lee: so, what's our destination du jour, jer.  i got a "c" plus on my french quiz.   jerry: megan and tony will be going to a cattle farm in texas, and you and marc are headed to a makeup factory in canada.  now, farewell, spies.  and watch that head wind coming off the ocean.  it's a doozy.   all: whoa.   marc: there it is, strangecreaturesighting headquarters.   lee: yeehaw.  uh, it's gonna be kind of hard )
