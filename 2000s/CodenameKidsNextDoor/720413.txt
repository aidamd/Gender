through the fog, i came upon a little bed of seaweed drifting in the waves, upon which lay a sleeping baby.  and when i picked him up and held him, i said to myself, " his golden curls must be made of sunlight, and his soft voice from the soothing surf.   flapjack:   bubbie: his eyes were made from the stars and the night sky.  ] and his ears were made of well, they looked like eggs.  and as i removed the seaweed you were so delicately wrapped in, i smiled and knew you were my little baby.  flapjack my little dream come true.   flapjack: aw, bubbie.  so, babies come from seaweed.   bubbie:
