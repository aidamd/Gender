 t you don't fancy.  well, i haven't given it much thought, have i.   daddy.  king wallace, dude...  hi.  kim possible.  welcome to our kingdom.  we are here for you, your majesty.  your majestyhow cool is that.  you must be wadethe super genius bl sidekick.  oh. i've never heard of you.  right. mmhmm.  yeah, that's because i prefer to, you know work behind the scenes.  i do all the important...  miss possible, could i speak to you privately.  sure.  see. i cover kim. i'm backup.  excuse me, don, but i really need to speak to miss possible alone.  that's ron.  ron.  thank you.  well, i'm bored.  so i'm off to ride the royal gocart.  gocart. freestyle.  oh, um... would you like to come.  dude, i'm all about gocarts.  very well.  so, what's this all about, your majesty.  oh, i have a problem.  a terrible ancient problem.  ancient.  it all started centuries ago with our first king.  unfortunately, my ancestor ruled the kingdom with cruel arrogance.  : please, highness my entire flock ran away and i need a few days to pay my taxes.   cry me a moat.  off to the tower with you.  what.   he was despised by his subjects, particularly his own knightsthe knights of rodeghan.  they were determined to dethrone him.  secret plans were drafted...  but they failed.  their grudge was passed down from generation to generation.  even today, the descendants of the knights are still out there, still plotting to end the royal lineage.  well, if your royal family has been okay for all these generations what's the problem now.  you met my son.  weaklink wally as the press has so cruelly dubbed him.  oh, yeah.  can i wear these.  a commoner wearing my racing togs.  ew, no, not your togs.  just your clothes.  i suppose i could just have them burned later.  yeah, baby, let's ride.   whoohoo.   tata, common ron.  it's good to be royalty.  you get gocarts.   i just can't believe that there are knights in this day and age.  oh, they're quite modern.  they have a web site.  a web site.  they have embraced the 21st century and they are more determined now than ever to abolish the monarchy.  well, no offense, your majesty but how do you know that this web site is really run by these knights.  it could be hackers playing a prank.  no. i fear for my son.    wade, come in, wade.  do you have any idea what time it is here.  are you picking up any aircraft in this area.  no. my scans show nothing.  scan higher. there's got to be something.   hey, that's weird.  what.  i'm picking up a satellite in geosynchronous orbit.  government. military.  private.  some company called rodeghan industries.  the knights of rodeghan.  i need the communicator to broadcast a scramble signal.   stop. you've got it, k.p.  laser fire should stop about... now.  hey.  you rock in stereo, wade.  can i go back to sleep now.  what was that.  wally. wally.  where's my son.  tea time.  oh, thank heavens.  oh, you see, miss possible i have urgent need of your services.  you simply must stay.  can't.  but my son is not safe here.  but i have to get back to school for the election.  what's an election.  something we'll lose if we don't get back on the campaign trail.  i've got it.  what say wally tag along with you.  america is so much larger than our land.  it would be a perfect place to hide.   well...  is your crib in a hood.  oh, that could be quite exhilarating.  wally:  oh, mrs. possible.    yes.   my cucumber sandwiches must have the crusts removed mmm... mmm...  kim.  mom, i know, but wally won't be here longjust till he's out of danger.  i'll show him danger if he doesn't get a clue.   oh, mrs. possible.   please, i beseech youlet me wear my own garments not these,, commoner rags.  you're keeping a low profile, remember.  there he is.  prince wally.  excuse me, pardon me, pardon me. everyone...  please listen up.  the press conference will begin shortly.  press conference.  what part of "low profile" don't you understand.  kim, your campaign needs a boost.  are you going to go on again about how popular brick is.  oh, sure, he's popular but he doesn't have a prince about to endorse himon tv.   it's not every day the sleepy little town of middleton plays host to royalty.  prince wally was kind enough to grant us an interview.  your highness, we were told you wanted to endorse someone for the school's upcoming election.  hmm. oh, yes, yes.  that one over there.  kim... something or other.  a bit high strung to ever be a worldclass leader but perfectly adequate for public high school.  perhaps you think you'd make a better class president.  well, naturally.  i have been groomed for greatness.  are you saying you would be a better class president than kim possible.  no, no, no, noi'm not saying that.  whew.  because it goes without saying.   hmm. perhapsi shall toss my crown into the ring after all.  reporter: kim possible.  you're running against royalty.  how does it feel.  i relish the competition.  after all, that's what democracy is all aboutearning the right to lead.  unless, of course, one has thebirthrightto lead.  there you have it, folks.  middleton high is in for a battle royale.  reporter: who will win.  the prince...  or the pauper.  : pauper.  i believe she was referring to you.  well. i shall consider my campaign strategy while lounging in the bath.  excuse me. who plans to draw it this evening.   perhapsyou, mrs. possible.  you haven't been pulling your weight around here of late.   wally, i think we need to have a little talk about how we do things in the land of the free.  blahblahblah, talk is cheap.  three dropsnot two, not four and then sprinkle this lavender.  mm, you are a good man and true.   i suppose i'll need some posters and buttons and such.  you'll get on that, of course. uh,no.  you shouldn't even be running at all.  you weren't even nominated.  oh...  i seeyou feel threatened.  i will gladly withdraw if that's what you want.  but that's not what the people want.  those same two guys and the cat.  yes.  and brick is yesterday's news.  really.  totally. it's wally all the way.  i got it all planned out but we have to get started immediately because the possible campaign is way ahead of us.  "the possible campaign." you'remycampaign manager.  yeah...  ...about that, it's like, a conflict of interest.  good luck, kim.  i'll just run my own campaignwith less golfing.   hey, wade, what's the sitch.  i checked out rodeghan's web site. and.  i found something, but i can't figure out what it means"the tapestry holds the truth." hmm...  : there was a tapestry in the palace.  i assure you, miss possible, my best people have examined the tapestrythey found nothing.  can't hurt to double check.  thanks for shipping it over so fast.  i'll i.m. you if i find anything. 'bye.  all right, kimmy we're ready to run the sequence.  great.  thanks for letting me use your lab, dad.  hey, what's federal funding for.   see anything.  hmm. nothing yet.  hold up. there's something there.  can you widen the beam.  sure thing.   "awaiting the light of a full harvest moon...  "rodeghan's foe will soon face his doom.  "in the shadow of the palace we will not be deterred.  the monarchy ends with wallace the third." so, for my own good, i should keep a low profile.  guys, this is serious.  wally, you are definitely the target and next week's a full moon.  hmm. next week also happens to be the election which you would likeverymuch to winwouldn't you.  she's trying to get you to stop campaigning.  will you forget about the election.  oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you.  i would like to save him from the knights of rodeghan.  miss possible, this prophecy clearly states that i must be in the shadow of the palace.  now, do you see the palace. i don't. do you.  that's true, i guess.   farewell, all. i'm off to biology class.  all: 'bye, wally.  all: tata.  man, he could go all the way.  yup, it's looking like prince wally is our next class president.  yeah, i bet he'll make regionals.  brick, there are no regionals for class president.  oh. well, he'll definitely be allstate.   vote for me, kim p.  sorry.  i'm already voting for prince wally.  oh.   hey, guys, sorry i'm la...a...a... ah.  : wally...  iis this a country. i never heard of it.  you will.  welcome to middleton.  your highness maybe we've pushed the royal angle too much.  : bite your tongue.  okay, sure, being a prince is how you got the voters'attention but now, they seem to actually like you.  as a... person.        hey, wade.  how's it going.  i'm all over it.  i'm putting up oomphier posters and i've been focustesting my new hair.  voters wanted it pulled back. what do you think.  i mean...  since the prince was on tv.  do you think the knights of rodeghan know he's in middleton.  don't know.  the prophecy mentioned a full moon.  sure did.  tonightis a full moon.  yeah, but it's like wally said.  he's nowhere near the palace.  no palace, no prophecy.  where is he now.  i'm guessing miniature golfing with his campaign manager...  : at middleton mini golf.  the sixth hole...  ...it's a palace.  where is that caddie.    yes.   hey.  by royal decree, i demand a doover.     i can't allow you to smash my presidential opponent.  oh, thank goodness you've arrived.  does this mean i can leave.  ron: ah.  a pointyball stick.  ah. laser pointyball stick.  "awaiting the light of a full harvest moon : "rodeghan's foe will soon face his doom.  "in the shadow of the palace it will not be deterred.  "the monarchy ends with wallace the third.  wellas you know i am known far and wide as wally, so surely...   leave him alone.  this is none of your concern, little girl.   the voters will not like this.  kimcatch.  be careful with that thing.  oops.  now, about you...  : oh, please.  my father will give you anythingwhatever you want.  : oh, please.   thetitanic's going down...  again.  gold, jewelsjust the speak the word and i will grant you...  ...nothing.  on second thought, i will grant you nothing.   oh, please. i'll give you anything.    stay here. and be quiet.   the prophecy never mentioned her.  prophecy, shmophecy.   maybe you should rethink this whole career choice.  reggie.   that's it.  no more mr. nice knight.   all too easy.   give it up, girl.    we don't want you...  we only want the prince.     ooh.  old faithful, indeed.   booyah.   so, you expect me to believe that these knights came to middleton minigolf to carry out some kind of ancient prophecy type deal.  officer hobble, i can't make this stuff up.  did you get the part about me in there.  vandalism to the minititanic.  and my name again is barkin, mr. steve barkin.  that's bar...  kim possibleyou saved my life.  no big, just doing the teen hero thing.  no. you are atrueleader.  you have my vote.  well, that's at least two votes.  all right, that's two votes for kim possible zero votes for brick flag 998 for prince wally.  you had my vote, dude.  way to go.   the guy has leadership experience.  he's very good at giving orders.  well, this was quite an invigorating race.  it sure was.  congratulations, son.  daddy.  you made it.  i wouldn't miss it for theworld.  now we must go home so that you may continue to prepare to take over the crown.  yes, actually, daddy there's something i've been meaning to speak to you about.  i've decided that after you retire i'd like to run for president of our land.   presidents don't get to wear the daycoat with the ermine trim.  : i hadn't thought of that.  oh, well, sacrifices must be made.  this contest has shown me that democracy is...  as my middleton peeps would say...  bombdiggity.  democracy.  but that means no more kings.  the prophecy.  "the monarchy ends with wallace the third." iit came true.  so it has.  coolnow you can go home and show the democracy thing.  no, kimi've decided to stay in middleton and finish my term as class president.  it's a magnificent burden.  wally's staying.  that's great.  just... great.  captioning sponsored by theu.s. department of education anddisney channel captioned bymedia access group at wgbh freeze.  you have the right to watch this cartoon.  you have the right to watch with a friend.  if you cannot afford a friend, one will be appointed for you.  theme music.   . he's on his way to the throne .  . he's on his way to success .  . but he has to go to school .  . he's got to ace that test .  . he's an emperor tobe .  . and he's gonna lead .  you know, it's all about me.  . exactly . let's go.  . he's going to kuzco academy .  . he's got to learn his abcs .  don't try to stop him, to top him.  ..  .  . he's got the cool .  . he's got the charm and the looks .  . and a hottie that can help him read .  . that thing called books .  . he's going to kuzco academy .  . he's gonna fulfill his destiny .  . his friends are loyal .  . it's royal .  . they'll help him 'gainst the foil .  friends. i thought this was all about me.  ha ha. spell my name again.  .  .  captioning made possible bydisney abc cable networks group  man: delivery for mr. kuzco.  right here, pal.   i'm gonna have to ask you to move along.  ok. ask away.   these chairs are here for people who intend to buy them.  i might buy it.  you've been here every day for the last 4 weeks.   i'm sorry, but you can't stay here.  can't.  what is this word "can't".  isn't that the dance that french ladies do.  the cancan't.  . duh dah, da da da da, duh dah .  . da da da da, duh dah .  . da da da da, la la la la la .  ..  oh. are you still here.  look, if you don't stop harassing me, i'm gonna find someone in authority to make you stop.  have you seen any mall security around.  i am mall security, and i don't have time for this.  don't you know it's novemperor 1st tomorrow.  of course i do.  that's the day when everyone gives me fancypants gifts.  which makes today the busiest shopping day of the year, of course.  so if you won't obey the rules, you're going to have to leave.  ha. yeah, right.  what are you gonna do, tooty toot your little mall cop whistle until i go.   ok. stop.   you haven't heard the last of me.  someday when you least expect it, maybe a wednesday, i'll be back.   i've got it.  a brilliant plan to get rid of kuzco once and for all.  first, we buy up all the unused land around the empire.  then we build luxury condominiums with dazzling views of the palace.  then westop.  one itty bitty problem. what. what.  . we're completely broke.  broke. broke.  no cash. couldn't even pay for your latte.  replaced it with decaffeinated dirt.  .  i don't understand. we had plenty of money.  where did it all go.  here are the 10 shiatsu togasizers you ordered.  all 10. yep.  goldplated. yeah.  well, send them all back.  now i want platinum. it's the new gold.  regardless of what happened to our funds, we need money.  like the gold in the royal depository.  too bad it's locked away until kuzco becomes emperor.  and the whole point is to stop kuzco from becoming emperor.  classic catch22, a paradox, like which came first, the chicken or the sousaphone.  only the chicken knows, and clucky ain't talking.  there's only one solution.  you're not touching clucky.  we're going to rob the royal depository.  i don't know. seems a little unethical.  you can wear one of those little robber masks.  whoohoo. i'm gonna look like a raccoon. )
