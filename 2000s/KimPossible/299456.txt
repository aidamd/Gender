 'cause i'm just like you, kim.  uh... wow.  oh, yeah.  can i mosey or what.   are you afraid of horses.  me, afraid.   yes.  it's not a real horse.  it's just a robot.  that's the kind of horse he fears most of all.  it was ten years ago out in front of smarty mart.   i lost two baby teeth that day.  changes a guy.  ron, you've got to get past this.  yeah, just be like kim.  she's not afraid of nothing.  kid, if being like kim was that easy, i would have done it a long time ago.  you can try.  fine.  nice robot horse.  nice robot.    sorry about that.  old tornado still has some glitches in his getalong.  outstanding work, slim.  is he cybertronic.  yep.  runs on a solarpowered, selfperpetuating power core.  mmhmm. mmhmm. you know, that's exactly what i said to rufus, right.  oh, yeah.   hey, squirt, you want to hit the general store with me.  got to get some supplies. sure.  you boys behave while i'm gone.  whatever you say...  squirt.  kimmie, you're in charge.  okay, dad.  come on.  i got all kinds of stuff i want to show you.  uh, cool.  where'd they move them habaneros to.  if you're fixing to rustle us up some of your famous fivealarm chow, i'm gonna be one happy camper.  ain't no campers out in these parts.  uh, right. buckaroos.  squirt, you're the best brother a fella could ever have, but you are a tinhorn.  bad as them other fellas they've been bringing in.  what other fellas.  possible. hamish.  i was wondering when we'd see your sorry self here.  i, of course, am being jocular when i say "sorry self." hold up there, hamish.  why did you expect me.  for the wild west science fest, of course.  are your partners ready.  uh, i'm in the dark here.  some meeting of the minds they're having over at the crooked d.  only the greatest scientific minds from around the world were invited.  i wasn't invited.  ooh... my bad.  well, we'd better be getting back to the other super geniuses.  um... toodles.  ooh. what happened to squirt, the happy camper.  ohoh, it's... it's no big deal.  i'd rather spend my time with you than... than a bunch of tinhorns, really.  yeehaw.  just wish i knew why i didn't make the cut.  are they all here.  yes, all the poindexters on your list are here.  so, now what.  prepare yourself, shego, for soon, the socalled geniuses will be yesterday's news.  i, dr. drakken, will be the most brilliant scientific mind on the planet.  yeah. you know what.  i'm gonna go ahead and put this plan in the failed co right now.   jos...  i don't know what to say.  uh, the word "obsession" comes to mind.  isn't it spanking.  totally.  i'm... i'm flattered.  you're a little light on the sidekick here, jos.  i'd say wade is a lot more than a sidekick, mister.  he runs kim's web site, builds all them gadgets.  he keeps the whole operation running.  i'm talking about me.  who.  the sidekick. huh.  usually acts in a support/distraction role.  not ringing any bells.  ron stoppable.  never heard of you.  but you must be awfully proud to be a friend of my cousin's.  oh, you probably don't recognize me without my trusty naked mole rat. tadah.  rufus.  now it's coming back to you.  i know everything about every one of kim's adventures, so i know how many times you saved the day.  i'm always right there.  the guy with the pocket that rufus comes out of.  uh, oh, yeah.  you're the one who's always losing his drawers.  oh, come on. it's only been six or eight times.  sent a little bird up a couple of years ago, so i got an eye on the whole spread.  oh, satellite, huh.  so, i guess you could take a look at the, uh...  crooked d.  yeah. you know, where all those tinhorn brainiacs are.  you know, squirt, i'm pretty handy with the cuttingedge tech myself, but i'm nowhere near as smart as you.  now, slim, i'm... i'm not that smart.  of course you are and you know it.  doesn't matter who else knows it.  i'd just like to know who put together that guest list.  dr. drakken: ladies and gentlemen, you may now put on your hats and become official buckaroos and buckarettes.  yippeekaiyay.  my own tenliter hat.  i'm most eager to rope them up and ride them out.    the farmer in the dell, the farmer in the dell    hiho the derryo, the farmer in the dell.    i love these cowboy songs.   wow, they're acting so... so...  silly.  not the word i would choose, but okay.  it's because they are wearing my new invention, the silly hat.   anyone who wears one of these hats will act as silly as...  your outfit.  i happen to feelmuymacho, thank you very much.  anyway, with the world's most brilliant people incapacitated...  you start looking pretty smart.  i will be the greatest mind on the planet because the rest will be reduced to babbling buffoons.   kim: well, i hate to brag, but it was pretty exciting that time drakken had a giant laser drill.  inside the world's largest cheese drill, which was not a cheesecutter building.  it was actually made of cheese.  yeah, that time.  you know all about that mission, huh.  hey. here i am, see, when we busted duff killagan in tokyo.  that's me, in the background there, see.  huh, no.  sorry.  wh... oh, you're right.  yeah, it's a japanese schoolgirl.  here's one i usually don't talk about, but since you're such a fan...  there was this topsecret thing called the centurion project...  which drakken and killagan wanted, but it got stuck on you and whenever you lied, the centurion battler would grow and spread all over your body.  boy, howdy.  i bet that's a halloween nobody in middleton will ever forget.  was that halloween.  i thought that was our big groundhog's day adventure.  how about when shego...  tutored seor senior, jr.  on how to be a bad guy.  or when drakken...  stole a weather machine.  uh, you know what.  let's forget about me for a minute.  let's talk about you.  sure. what are you into.  you.  o...kay.  i'm going to mosey somewhere else.  later.  let's go outside and do something.  you got it.  here's an idea.  why don't you decide what we do.  i have got a great idea.  excellent. what do you want to do.  whatever you want to do.  oh...  just a few adjustments to the satellite surveillance system and...  whatcha doing, mr. doctor p..  um, uh, not spying on the wild west science fest, i can tell you that.  hey, isn't that your old pal, professor ramish.  it is.  that is one strange square dance.  i bet it's a squareroot dance.  which is, what.  i don't know, but it's the sort of thing the smartest people in the world would do if they all got together.  i don't care if i wasn't invited, i'm going over to the crooked d.  count me in. it's gotta be better than hanging out with the neverheard ofron fan club.  i mean, i know dr. drakken is your archfoe, but it seems to me, shego's the really dangerous one.  i mean, if she put her mind to do it, she could be the toughest villain out there.  don't you think. kim.  kim.  kim..  wade.  hey, kim. please tell me that someone, somewhere needs me to do something.  what's the static.  my little cousin is my number one fan.  aw, how sweet.  well, at first, but i can't take it anymore.that's the price of fame.  you won't believe what it's like forme when i go to the computer store.  i wonder where she could have got to.  kim: i'm serious, wade.  she's so got to get a life.  preferably her own.   oh, no.  she heard you.   she so heard me.   something's not right.  they're acting like a bunch of goofs.  dr. p., sometimes you have to let your hair down.  you got to get loose.    you know what.  maybe some boundaries are being crossed here.  what is wrong with you, man.   what's going on down there.  looks like trouble.  better report it fast.  hombre one to drakken.  we have varmints.  drakken: we have what.  varmints. what is a varmint.  shego. hereyou speak hombre.  give me that.  howdy, hombre.  what in tarnation is agoin' on.  looks like we got us some varmints.  what does that mean..  hey. um... i'm sorry.  i mean, itit was so nice that you picked me to be your hero, and i end up being a total jerk.  it's not your fault.  it is. it really is.  i mean, well, you're...  just a nobody, stuck here in the middle of nowhere.  jos, i was just a nobody.  i mean, not anobody.  nobody's a nobody.  everybody's somebody. right.  is this supposed to make me feel better.  i'm just a regular person.  i'm into cheerleading and boys... sometimes.  you know, regular stuff.  you do incredible stuff.  you save the world.  jos, i'm just, you know, me.  that's all i ever try to be, and it turned out that sometimes being me is enough to save the world.  yeah, and that's why being you is so cool.  try being youit'll be even cooler.  doubt it.  kim, you'd best get down here.  both: what's the sitch.  oops. sorry.  no big.  ron and dad.  captured by shego.  that means your archfoe is next door.  spankin'.  jos, it is not spankin'. it's serious.  but nothing ever happens around here.  this is major.  that's what i'm afraid of.  so.  we've got a new team here.  the genius and the lackwit.  don't let him call you a lackwit.  whatever your evil scheme is, lipsky, it won't work.  uhhuh, but it already has, and all prisoners will refer to me as dr.  drakken.  you'll always just be drew lipsky, the science student who couldn't make the grade.  i will now.  you see, possible, i've adjusted the curve.  you gathered the greatest minds on the planet here, so you could alter their intelligence and make yourself seem smarter.  aha.  how's he doing that.  that's for me to know and you to find out.  it's obviously those cowboy hats.  they probably contain some hidden circuitry that alters brain wave efficacy.  you possibles take the fun out of everything.  yeah, well, it runs in the family.  there's a possible posse heading into town.   looks like they're expecting us.  oh, that's a passel of hombres.  can we take them.  got to remember, josboth: anything's possible for a possible.  let's ride.    hickabickaboo.  yeehaw.  you know what's nice about robot horses, partner.  magna hooves.  oh.       hang on, jos.  i'll bust out dad and ron.   so not the drama. oh.  thanks, kid.  couldn't have done it better myself.  oh, this is all my fault.  well, little darling, now, you can't just go imitating everytng you see cousin kim doing.  don't blame yourself, jos.  it's my fault for being such a nosy parker.  dad.  kim, the man is a nosy parker.  ron. fear not.  we've got this escape in the pocket.  gotcha.   rufus.  kangaroo rat.  he did it.     you actually fell for the old keynearthecelldoor ruse.  and you're not even wearing the silly hats.  good hustle anyway, buddy.  i just want to know one thing about your evil plan, lipsky.  well, i do like to gloat about the nuances of my schemes.  fire away.  if you gathered the greatest minds on the planet, why did you leave me out.  because you're a possible.  you people are such pests.  yep.  what was that.  what. that boop, boop.  oh, that. 'tweren't nothing.  that was just me activating old tornado.  is that all.  well, never mind that... wait.  who is old tornado.   that's my big brother.  good horsey.  what's he doing.   see, the little pony outside smarty mart could never do that.  yep, old tornado is one of a kind.  come on. let's get drakken.  oh, i'll take that.  whoa.  hang on, ron.   horsey, come back.  this is goodtime fun.  give me the remote, shego.  i don't think so, and if you come any closer, your sidekick gets bucked into the next county.  can you do anything.  nope. afraid of that.  now. now.  what. i...   no fair.   uhuhuh.  oh, no.  that's original.  whoa.  that was radical.  thanks. just doing the jos thing.  whoawhoa, whoa, whoa.   huh.  huh. i'll take that.  what did you say to it.  oh, nothing. i just knew there was an off switch back here.  see. i couldn't have done that.  dr. d., i'd say it's about time to vamoose.  we need something big to cover our escape.  i've got it.  stampede.   no, seriously, fellows.  a stampede would be very helpful here.  allow me.  huh. that there is dang weird.  dad.  possible.  what's this all about.  silly hat.   well, squirt, did you work up an appetite.  yes, i am hankering for some grub, i'll tell you what.  maybe you're not such a tinhorn after all.  hey, where's jos.  haven't seen her in a while.  me neither.  she was bending ronald's ear about something.  are you guys ready to eat.  oh, boy.  kim, i just figured out who the real hero is around here.  ron. totally.  it's hard to argue.  ron here is afraid of practically everything.  but does he let his fears keep him from sidekicking.  i do not.  attaboy.  let's face it, kim, you can do anything, so facing all those dangers and villains, well, it's just like you sayno big.  well, uh, i guess.  a fellow filled with that much fear always charging into action with you.  seems to me that's a true hero.  i can tell she's a possible.  mmhmm. smart as a whip, this kid.  captioned bymedia access group at wgbh . todd and riley were, oh, so sad . then they came 'cross a fleemco ad . they sent away $1.98 . got a superspy mom and a daredevil dude of a dad . replacements . the replacements . now anytime they come across adults . who are sly and deny and defy them . and make things bad  hello, fleemco.  sir, we need a replacement.  and fast.  . and anytime they wanna make a change . modify and rearrange, though it might get kinda strange . make 'em better, nicer, stronger, faster . smart and cool and maybe even lame . call in the replacements . replacements . get the replacements . expect the replacements . replacements . get the replacements .  stank city home of our hero, the stinker.   but all is not well in stank city.  the stinker is attacked.  ambushed by the villainous dr. dark light and his rentagoons, things look terrible for our hero...  but the stinker was playing possum.   he lures the villains into his trap, topples dr. dark light with his super stank, saving stank city.  so, let me get this straight.  he defeats villains by how do i put this tooting.  the stinker does not toot.  he rips.  he cuts one.  he doesn't toot.  todd.  you're embarrassing me.  i'membarrassingyou.  with all these geeks around.   these "geeks" are fans of the world's greatest storyteller d.k. growley, famed author of theannie cromwellseries.  she's the best writer ever.  you could learn something from her.  what. how to be a weirdo.  ooh, i can't wait to get my hands on that advance copy of book 17.  the thrilling finale annie cromwell and the thrilling finale.  i just know annie will finally kiss juan carlos, the hunky student detective.  and then she'll face down the evil, baldheaded wizard, robespierre.   aah. penguin.   they're the clowns of antarctica.  dad. do we have to be at this dorktoberfest.  todd, you know your mother's on a spy mission and won't let you stay at home alone.  all right. your mother won't letmestay at home alone.  huh. you sell the house to one fake leprechaun for one fake pot of gold, and you're a fakeleprechaunbelievinghouseseller for life.   sold.  oh, man. why didn't you just call fleemco and have them replace mr. vanderbosch with a copy of the book or something.  oh, todd, todd, todd.  they wouldn't do it.  i guess i'll have to take my chances like everyone else.  and now, the winner of the totally random drawing is...  taking chances like everyone else, huh.  the winner is riley daring.   what. is it a penguin.   ahhahahaha.
