  whoa. whoa, mad dog.  you're getting foam in my gill.  : gill, gill, gill...  remember me.  not really, and i got to tell you, i think i'd remember.  oh, come on, ronnie, think. gil.  i am no longer gil.  now i am gill.  uh, what's the difference.  i added an "l." you know, as in "gill".  as in fish things that grew when i mutated.  you can't win, ronnie.  this is my eleme sorry to bother you, dr. lurkin.  i just wanted to check on a patientgill...  you knowgidoublel, the mutant spelling.  oh, golly, no, it's one "l" again.  he's quite a success story.  100% human.  even made the honor roll.  where. at mutant high.  oh, no, it's a public school.  he's adjusted quite well.  busy with extracurricular activities.  intermutant swim team.  no. i believe he's on the football team.  uh, he's... well, uh, what do they call it.  uh... mascot.    hey, ronnie. remember me.  aah. kim. rufus. he's got me.  you bet i do. noogie.  hi, kim. can you believe it.  ronnie and i are going to be roommates, just like old times.  am i mutating.  ddo you see any webbing, scales, funky lips.  try to keep an open mind. people can change.  that's what i'm afraid of.  uhoh. i think i feel a fork in my tongue.  oh, you have got to be kidding.  : we're... roommates.  no way. cabin nine.  cabin nine. okay, we have to deal.  good. while you're dealing, i'm claiming the top bunk.  i wanted the top bunk.  knew you would, but it's like the top of the pyramid, kmyrightful place.  say what. k.p., try to keep an open mind.         woman: hello, gottagriners.  welcome, welcome, welcome  to camp kickoff.  you know, kim, i have some coverup that'll help conceal those monstrous bags under your eyes.  wouldn't have bags under myyes if it weren't for your ferociously loud snoring.  : me, snore.  must've been the crickets.  only if you inhaled them.  before we bring the middleton high cheer squad onstage, i've got awayfantastic announcement.  this year, the cheerleader with the most superduper attitude and mad cheer skills will be awarded the gottagrin spirit stick.  let me hear you say yeah.  might as well give it to me now.  yeahif it's for mad snore skills.   ronnie... what are you doing..  you looked like you needed help.  oh. yeah. thanks, gil.  hey, where's your outfit.  oh, i want it to be a surprise.  notesuspicious thing number five: just because i'm paranoid doesn't mean gil isn't out to get me.   aw, you're tired.  maybe i should take the top spot on the pyramid.  that's sweet, but i've got a spirit stick to win.  all: mad dogs here, we can play.  watch our moves, and you will say: go, mad dogs, go, go, mad dogs.  go, mad dogs.  go, go, mad dogs. whoa.  oh.  are you okay, kim.  super spirit, cheerleader.  aw, hang in there, camper.  that's stick's not really made of gold, is it.  gold plastic, but it's not what the spirit stick is made out of, ron.  it is what it represents.  what's that.  that bonnie can't have it.  at least you can prove your roommate is up to no good.  yo, ronnie.  we're smores outside.  try one. i added a special ingredient.  hey, hey, thanks, roomie.  you rock.  : smore.  hey.  what are you doing.  special ingredient.  special mutating ingredient.  so wrong. i'm the one with the evil roomie here.  i got go.  i'm keeping my friends close and my enemies closer.  hey, gil, wait up.     the game's afoot, rufus.   frog fancy. suspicious thing number 22.  mm, suspicious thing number 23.  oh, no.  i think we lost him.  he could be anywhere.  stay close, rufus.  wannaweep is a dangerous and cursed place.   it's a mutant footprint.  and it's fresh.    kim.  you know, bonnie, the path to the spirit stick isn't paved with tardiness.  i'm tardy because you unplugged my alarm clock.  : is that what that clock was.  kim, gill's an evil mutant again.  look, i have evidence.  a magazine.  and i saw a footprint.  uh, freako.  yes, a freaky footprint.  look, ron, i think before you accuse, you need actual proof.  you want proof.  you can't handle the proof.   attention, happy campers.  remain calm, but there is a mutant among us.  behold...  the muck monster.  dude, what's your damage.  i wanted to surprise everyone with my mascot outfit.  outfit. wait, i...  yeah, my school's team is the brookdale horned toads.  but, but, you snuck out last night.  yeah, to pick up my costume. what'd you do.  follow me or something.  follow. well, i... i wouldn't say followed, 'cause that sounds, you know, paranoid and suspicious.  loo...hoo...ser.  hey, mad dog, why don't you roll over and play dead.  all : loser. loser. loser.   what is it. what's happening.  oh, i'm just evening out my tan.  hope i didn't wake you.     all yours, roomie.   kim.  oops. did i use up all the hot wateragain.   hey, better hurry up or you'll be late for cheer practice.  your wasting your time, kim.  i'm not going to break.  well, i'm not going to break, either.  so just because i'm a little paranoid, the entire camp's out to get me.  and, you know, you'd think at some point they'd run out of rotten vegetables to pelt me with.  all : loser. loser. loser.  communicator.   hey, wade, what's the sitch.  wade: wannaweep update.  the lake is clean, but i scanned wider and found a small grotto up the south shore.  grotto. always hated that word.  it's showing some weird readings.  how weird.  evil mutant weird.  i knew it.  we got to find kim. you she'll believe.  hold up. i'm getting some static.  looks like it's coming from telecommunications scan.  i think somebody's trying to...  wade, wait. speak to me.   come on, rufus, we're heading to the grotto.  ooh, hate that word.   yep, evil place.  at last, after searching night after night, i have found my magic mucka.  magic mucka.  sounds worse than grotto.    creature from the muck lagoon.   kim, gill with the two l's is back.  ron, got other things on my mind.  and now, representing the brookdale horned toads, let's show our fierce spirit for gill moss.   now, that's a routine.   don't you screams get it.  this is my revenge.  it starts by turning you all into my mutant minions.  oh, sure.  they don't throw fruit at him.  ah, man.     run for it. i'll...  oh, right. i step aside, you save the world, and suddenly you're taking home the spirit stick.  bonnie, this so isn't the time forlook out.  yuck.  stoppable, get back here and save us.  or, more specifically, me.   chill, bonnie.  ron knows exactly what he's doing.  i hope.  please don't be dead. please don't be dead.  please don't be...  bingo. dial tone.  that makes the score ron, one. doublel gill, zero.  okay, so now it's all tied up.  hello, squeab.  we meet again.   whoa, mutant camouflage.  that would be so cool if...  never mind.  man, i got to thank you. swapping swim time with arts and crafts so many years ago, was the best thing to ever happen to me.  i thought you hated being a mutant.  hence the whole "revenge" business.  i did hate it, but once i turned human, i missed the immense power that comes with toxicgenetic mutation.  i guess it's a "grass is always greener" kind of thing, huh.  right.  i want it to be greener.  so you sabotage the pipes of the community college knowing we'd all be relocated to gottagrin.  and now i'm going to slim the campers of all the camps around lake wannaweep.  and guess what.  you're first.   dang, fell for that one last time.   bonnie, hand me your nail file.  i can use it to cut us out of here.  you. you're not getting all the credit.  i'm cutting us out of here.    for pity sake, not again.  : fine.  take it already.   let's finish this so i can go blast the rest of the camps in peace.    poor squeab.  he could run, but he couldn't hide.   as of right now, ron stoppable is all done running.  yeah.  it's the only way.      barkin: you know, no matter how many times you get slimmed by a genetic mutant, you never quite get used to it.  we got to find gill.  looks like he already hit band camp.  barkin: that's science camp.  kim: he's heading to clown camp.  those poor clowns.     hey, gill, excuse you.  ronnie, you're a... what is that.  a chipmunk or something.  actually, i think i'm a beaver.  i guess when you plunge head first into a toxic pool you never exactly know what you're going to get.  eat muck, chipmunk.   it's beaver.    it's gill and ron.  and he's... a chipmunk.  stoppable: beaver. i'm a beaver.  told you he knew what he was doing... i think.      mr. barkin, we're going to need a lift.  prepare to launch.  fire one.  fire two. now, hold up. i...  go.  a backflip hurkey spring.  and a sidehurdler liftup.  that's a little more this century.    what better way to catch a huge fish than with a huge net.  way to go, beaver boy.  oh, yeah.   wow, it's good to be human again.  although i really wanted to build a dam, you know, just for the experience.  mr. stoppable, i owe you an apology.  i... i really thought gill had changed.  he did, in a more evil takeovertheworld kind of way.  i can only blame myself.  i just didn't set enough limits for him.  this isn't over, squeab.  this is far from over.  that's enough out of you, young man.  no tv for a week.   thanks for the help, k.p.  i seriously couldn't have done it without you.  no, big.  as much as it pains me to say it, i couldn't have done it without bonnie.  shh. they're awarding the spirit stick.  okay, cheerpeople, we've all had a wild week, but it takes more than a rampaging muck monster to stop the gottagrin spirit.  so the spirit stick goes to shark kid from west wakewater high.  go... sharks.  huh. after all that, we got nothing.  i mean, we do we take away from this.  who cares what we take from it. i lost.  bonnie, there's always something you can learn from any experience.  even if you lose.  normally, i'd say we learn that suspicion and paranoia is bad, except that's what saved us.  true.  well, maybe we learned that... i don't know.  i didn't learn anything.  that's it.  looking at you two it's so clear.  girls: what is so clear.  if you two had set aside your differences earlier, one of you could have won that spirit stick.  that's the lesson here.   how about cheer camp stinks.  yeah. agreed.  yeah, it works for me.  oh, yeah.  captioned bymedia access group at wgbh . todd and riley were, oh, so sad . then they came 'cross a fleemco ad . they sent away

time has come.  never. when i defeat you, i will regain my place as lord chancellor of lower termitia and you will return to the dust from whence you came.   say farewell to.   you have summoned the wrath of our giant redheaded god.  come on, ya bugs.  do something interesting.  thank you, todd, for wasting another five minutes of my life on termites.  that was even worse than buzz's violently inaccurate portrayal of robert oppenheimer smashing an atom.  atoms are losers. why did i agree to help him with the smashing and the costume and the painful, painful fusion.  jacobo jacobo. your science presentation is next.  jacobo, i'm asking you as a friend, could you just be a little less smarterer than usual.  if you ruin the curve again, i'll get a d.  and that means summer school.  and you know what summer school means.  school. in the summer.  i feel your pain, todd, but i cannot contain the brilliance that is...  jacobobobobo.  i present to the class...  driftwood nature's art.  driftwood.  driftwood.  well, that's just...  that's...  yes.jacobobobo blows it.  just wonderful.  i love driftwood. and this looks just like boutros boutrosghali.  whoo. i can finally complete my collection of driftwood that looks like un secretarygenerals.   aplus for jacobo.  well done. and dminuses for everyone else, because that's how grading curves work.  awwww.  stupid jacobo and his stupid driftwood.  always getting a stupid aplus.  i'd like to stupid make him pay. but how.  unfair. unfair. unfair.  unfair. hmmm. hmmm...  unfair. huh.  my driftwood.  my desk.  my wooden shoes.  this is it, winters.  you're gonna pay for the damage you've caused.  how's a threeweek vacation sound.  awesome.  very funny.  you know what's not funny.  mr. vanderbosch sitting at home picking termites out of his underwear.  that's pretty funny.  i didn't do it.  oh, really. because we did some checking and this mallet came back as registered to you.  sure, it's my mallet.  what i meant was, i didn't do it on purpose.  somebody put that termite farm on my desk.  oh, yeah. well that's not what my surprise witness says.  he did it. on purpose.  you're suspended.  what.. i didn'tdaring.  dadadada.  ow.  did you hear.  buzz is back.  and it sounds like he's coming after you. why would he do that.  i don't know. he's probably mad at me for pinning that whole termite thing on him.  and by "pinning," i mean revealing that he and he alone destroyed vanderbosch's )
