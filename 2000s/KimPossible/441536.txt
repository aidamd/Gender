 ah, now i see it.  kim: i still can't believe it.  how we let drakken and shego get away.  on the upside, g.j. did capture all the henchmen.  and drakken was foiled.  not captured, but foiled.  yay.  oh, i guess we just have to wait till drakken's next takeovertheworld scheme.  now take the shampoo and lather.  ii already showered this morning before i left the house.  what you did or didn't d under uncontrolled conditions is not relevant.  yeah, but if you shampoo too frequently, it can dry out your follicles, give you wicked split ends, you know.  lutz. don't make me come down there.  lutz. just put it in your hair.  you don't have to shout.  ..  lutz.  lutz. huh.  ..hmm, let's see.  uh, you're a chicken. cluck, lutz.   ha ha ha ha ha.  it worked. yes.  all we have to do, shego, is put dr. b's brainwashing shampoo and cranium rinse in every store, and the world will soon be my pawn.  ha ha ha ha ha. isn't thatshego.  hey. i was listening to that.   where's the tune.  oh, how's operation gettingmoreridiculousbytheday going.  hmm. see for yourself, ye of little faith.   what aspect of the chicken dance is supposed to wow me.  it's just a demonstration.  the point is, his personality is putty to me.  " aren't you being a little too up front here.  truth in labelling laws, shego.  i'm a supervillain, not a corporate shyster.  now i must put on my marketing hat and move some product.  drakken: does your shampoo make you feel like this.  mine does.  drakken's brainwashing shampoo and cranium rinse.  feel like a new you.  now available at smarty mart, where smart shoppers shop smart.  when ron met rufus: notes.  ron, tell me again why we had to come to smarty mart.  gotta recreate the event up here.    i told you, rufus, we're not here for toys. this is for art.  can we go.  oh, and i need to get some ointment for toenail fungus. yeah.  need i bother with the, "ew, ugh," or is it a given.  sitch me, wade.  hey, wade, uh, what do you know about toenail fungus.  ew. ugh.  yep, that's what i said.  he's selling ashampoo.  yeah. you heard. i see.  it's supposed to hypnotize anyone who uses it to do whatever drakken says.  " hmm, points for full disclosure.  the good news is, nobody's buying it.  the product is a bomb.  maybe it's his picture on the bottle.  so, what do we do.  if the shampoo doesn't start selling soon, end of plot.  wow. drakken is selffoiling now.  spankin'.  hmm. i don't get it.  what went wrong.  hmm, i don't know.  do you think maybe it was your picture on the bottle.    .   who is this anyway.

need to get my brainwashing shampoo into a hot rap.  that'll hook the kids.  .  hmm, i would like you to mention my shampoo in one of your raps.  you'd really be doing me a solid.  . i don't think so.  ..  perhaps if you try the product, you might change your mind.  i don't think so.  but this is crucial to my plan.   fool.  ..  i cannot believe honey, and didn't get me an autograph.  i was focusing on taking over the world instead.  one has to wonder about my priorities.  so what now.  don't know, don't care.  ok, well, fine, fine.  have a good weekend. see you monday.  it's friday.

answer.  sing the world into submission.   shego, that's it. yes. really.  no, this time. trust me.  what.  and here i thought i was the evil genius.  you're brilliant.  what are you talking about.

bitterly disappointed this evening.  you watch this.  only when it's on. point.  i don't know.  the judge is so rude andand mean, it kind of makes my skin crawl.  that's what's great about it.  the skin crawlingesnessness.  not only can't you sing, your clothes are simply dreadful, and your freakish overbite frightens small mammals.   my skin. ew. crawling.  next up, a young lady with a voice that could melt flesh.  he's tough, but cool.  wait. shh.   no, i didn't just    roll out of bed    this is the shape of my head    don't be fooled or misled   ..   she wouldn't have lasted 5 minutes at karaoke night.  whatever. she will be famous tomorrow.  you're right. that's it.  really. really it this time.  oh, no.  i'll launch my musical career on american starmaker.  bada bing. instant fame.  for 15 minutes.  that's all i need.   hello.  how you doin'.  are you the producer of american starmaker.  look, buddy, auditions for next season start in july.  now, if you don't mind, i'm takin' a steam.  oh, i don't want to be on it next season, i'm thinking this week.  how did you get in here.  i think i can make you change your mind.  i need to cool off.  yes, a nice shower is just what you need.  now, about my slot on your show.  ron: all right, so, time is running out, but i will not panic, k.p.  you're panicking, aren't you.  ron, why do you do this to yourself.  kim, procrastination is one of the few skills i've mastered.  don't slam it.  oh, look. tv.  our next victim goes by the name of dr. deez.  oh, joy.  you, what up, dog.  no.  it can't be.  and yet, it is.  you think your skin was crawling before.   kim, are you watching.  yep, but not believing.  oh. too bad.  we're out of time for this week, but you'll be the first off the block next time.  and i can't wait.  butwade.  i'm on it, kim.  i'll start working my sources.  man, i wish i had sources.  the project's due monday, and you have a title.  ok, i lied about the title thing, but i have a topic in my pocket.  me.  where have you been.  class. oh, right.  anyway, here's what i got on our american starmaker.  remember that bogus shampoo drakken tried to sell.  uhhuh. the one no one bought.  well, he's planning on plugging it in his song.  and the point would be.  stuff talked about in his song becomes hot and cool.  so you think people will snap up drakken's shampoo just because he raps about it.  millions of people watch american starmaker.  plus, if drakken actually wins, he'll get a record contract, movie deal, who knows.  who does know.  hmm. we've gotta pull drakken's plug.  here you go, buddy, chimurrito and a nacko.  mmm. nacko.  focus on the deadline, ron.  i'm working on the writing assignment, ok.  i was talking about drakken on tv tomorrow night.  yeah, ok, look, there's really only one thing to do.  yeah. what's that.  you need to go on that show and win.  beat drakken at his own game.   that's the only think we can do, huh.  think about it, k.p.  you blew them away at last year's talent show.  admittedly, i won.  but you were a very strong second.  mmhmm. mmhmm.  but this is on national television, ron.  and the judge is so mean.  kim, you foil superfreaks on a daily basis, and you're worried about some snarky tv pretty boy.  huh.  well, yeah, pretty much.  judge: listen, thanks for that shampoo.  i feel so unbelievably mellow.  you hear that, shego.  mellow.  hey, good luck out there.  in the bag, shego. believe the hype.  i know i'm gonna regret saying this, but i think you may have finally achieved " word up, shego.  ron, this is so dumb, it can't work.  yeah, right, chill down. it'll work.  "yo, listen up. hap' a holla from ron".  i wanted it to sound like me.  why don't you shoot for sound like english.  welcome and good evening.  first up, i think this guy has a lot of talent and could
