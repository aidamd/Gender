 everything. i know. isn't it exciting.  yeah, exciting. change is good.  this stuff is all for the university of upperton.  hmm, how did that happen.  maybe an alumni did it. mom.  well, they do have a wonderful premed program.  you know, fyi.  kimmy, i understand you need new mission wear.  you know where i can still buy.  oh, no. better.  pretty sweethaisn't she.  this is better.  see, honey, it's been my dream to see you save the world without baring your midriff.  you want me to wear it.  greetings, ms. possible.  would you like to try me on now.  dad: looking good, kimmy.  and it's the very latest in astroblasto technology.   it's sort of bulky.  computer: i beg your pardon.  press the orange life support button on your control pad.  battle ready for any atmospheric conditions.  i appreciate that, dad, but i'm not sure this is gonna work.  did i mention the builtin kimmunicator.  hey, wade, what's the sitch.  uh, you first, kim. are you inside a spacesuit.  mission suit, wade.  drakken and shego were spotted breaking into the middleton magnetic institute.  didn't know there was one, but i'm on it.  good luck. looks like you'll need it.  i heard that.  ok, dad. no choice but to try it.  then you'll need to know about the purple button.   rockets are go.  the transhemispheric magnetoscope is mine, shego.   now we can live happily ever after.  kim: once upon a crime.  ok, i am so being outshined right now, it's not even funny.  ha ha ha.  you know what's funny. that getup.  it's an astronot.  ha ha ha.  game recognizes game.  whoa.  i'll be waiting in the getaway craft.  wade:..  i think i know what drakken's trying to steal.  wade, move. i can't see.  oh, call me back.  oh, no.  you can't dress, you can't fight, you got no mojo.  you wish.  suit yourself, then. kim.  computer: sorry. i failed you, kim possible.  wade: so drakken is obviously stealing parts to build something.  but what. i so hate surprises.  monique: surprise.  call you back, wade.  what's all this.  need a mission suit. i got your back, girl.  i've been waiting to take this assignment on for a long time.  what's that supposed to mean.  uh, check the goods.  flexible. rip resistant. button or zip front. optional pockets. vneck or crew.  kim, are you ok.  um, yeah. think so.   uh, hello.  hi, honey. something urgent has come up.  can you get away.  so why are we at your old university.  i pulled some strings, called in a favor, and, well, the dean cleared his schedule.  he can do your personal interview right now.  ms. possible, come, come.  you can thank me later. good luck, honey.  um, hi.  let's get to it, shall we.  why should this university consider you for admission, ms. possible.  ..   this must look bad, but could ..  reports of a breakin at the middleton geological center.  we have a geological center, too. who knew.  hey, kim, heard you need a new mission suit.  hey. i was talking to kim.  but this is an emergency.  wade: i'm trying to brief her, so stop interrupting.  your suit isdrakken's probably gonna steal thecheck the trunk, kim.  uh, what about me. hello.  i have to know where to go.  geological center, ron. hurry.  where's that. ugh.  aah. uh.   oh, shego, my sides hurt. ha ha.  where are the fashion police when you need them.  see how funny you find this.  ooh.  ha ha. hee hee.  will you stop it. i can't take it anymore.  ha ha. ha ha.   i can't believe drakken and shego got away again.  i really need my old mission clothes' mojo.  that's not what makes kim possible possible.  aw. i think i'll keep you around, ron.  uunless, you know, what if those were your lucky duds, the secret to your success, without which you could never defeat .  of course, that's just one theory.  this is so frustrating.  i don't have time to shop for a new mission outfit because of college admissions, and i don't have time for college admissions because i need to shop for a new mission outfit.  one crisis at a time.  otherwise, i get, like, you know, so confused it's ridiculous.  even if i did go shopping this afternoon, who would give me a second opinion.   yo, yo         desperate times, desperate measures.  the clothing criminals we put in jail.  who better to design your new mission outfit.  so about the orange jumpsuits.  we've got seamstresses on the outside.  cheaper, faster, below wholesale.  i'll talk to my people.  ok, who is that blocking our sun.  we only get an hour a day.  well, there goes the prison yard.  yo, fashion felons, my lady are i are cruising for some hip designage, so we came to the best.  or the worst.  sorry. not gonna happen.  well, i guess if we can't interest them in designing my new signature mission outfit.  don't move. pen.  shorten the sleeves. move the pocket.  address that. change the neckline.  more linear.  mmhmm, mmhmm. ooh, ooh. yeah.  oh, gee.  ha ha. sorry about that.   ball.  i love it. it's perfect.  ..  woman in hood: to break us out of here.  no deal.  whatev.  hey.   so, dad, how many colleges did you apply to.  well, honey, there was only one college for me.  mist. mist.  middleton's institute of science and technology.  how about tomorrow afternoon.  ..  good, seeing as you've already visited your mother's university.   possible.  colleges, tests, applications. i'm on it.  and when is my college admissions appointment, mr.  ha ha ha. you.  cplus grade average, former mad dog, current allstar running back.  how many colleges will court me, huh, you know, i mean, at last count.  zero, k.p.  not one of these socalled "institutions of higher learning" asked about the stoppable son.  yeah. that's really surprising.  new college opening this fall.  maybe i'm trying too hard.  maybe all i need is a tshirt and these cuffed jeans.  cuffed jeans.  yeah. how over.  i think i was 12.  international continental university.  you know, since they've never had students before, yup, sounds like i.c.u. is a perfect fit.  .  can't. i'm touring my dad's college today.  you will find a new mission outfit.  rufus, something we said.  plans. plans. what plans.  oh, sorry. got to go.  oh, don't tell me he's touring colleges, too.  oh, man. now i'm in a funk.  and it's not a good look for me.  bueno nacho later.  huh. i think i'll keep you around.  where to, buddy.  ah, lab 32 "a," the first chemistry la maybe one day soon, you'll be evacuating a lab on this very campus, kimmy.   right.  eight more buildings to tour in earth sciences alone.  great.  and here's where i studied the principles ..  my introduction to computational methods of nanobiotechnologies.  i can still feel the rush.   experimental compoundrf78.  this is dating myself,but they were only on rf16 when i was an undergrad.  ..  uh, dad, are you sure about sticking your hand in there.  kimmy, there's no place for skepticism in science.  now, watch this.  well, i'll be. they perfected it.  wow. i didn't know you were that strong.  rf78 absorbs energy, multiplies it, and they seem to have solved the hives glitch, too.   guess where drakken and shego are stealing something now.  where. about 30 yards from you.  " that's a top secret lab nobody gets in.  we were just about to tour it.  ..   now.  good luck, kim. and the battle suit.  still working on it.  say, dad.  shouldn't you be shopping for something suitable to wear.  why. purple seems to be my color.  it's like a little slice of experimental computer chip heaven.  i'll take that.  shego, is it so hard to keep one bouncy teenager at bay.  trying.  quantum tectonic microchip at last.  ohh, she's making me more nauseous than usual.  kim: yikes. whoa.  looks like purple isn't your color after all, kimmy.  but come to think of it, what is.   kimmy. dad.  when you reach the speed of light, the compound breaks down.  hello.  behold, the final piece.  world domination at last.  ron: let me guess. not a real university.  oh, you're gonna be schooled.  i've tried everything.  kimmy, you'll find something.  i won't. maybe ron was right.  ronald right. uh, about what exactly.  maybe the clothes were key.  without my mission outfit, i'm kim impossible.   drakken: where is that kim possible.  my arms and jaw are killing me.  don't you hate it when heroes show up late.  it's just so rude.  doesn't know i'm here.  i'm beginning to think he came alone and that kim possible doesn't know he's here.  yeah. ok, never went to college, did he.  reject. dropout, shego.  for the last time, they let me in. i justigrr.  without kim possible, there's no one to stop me from charging my greatest invention.  we know. the intercontinental hooeymajiggy.  intercontinental electromagnetisizer, shego.  it's charging.  so what does it do.  curious myself in an "i know this will never work" sort of way.  let me educate you both, being that this is a university.  no, it's not. no, it's not.  grr.  once charged with enough electrons, an intense magnetic field will merge the world's continents into one supercontinent.   ooh, it moves continents.  who wouldn't want one of those.  think how easy it would be to rule the world, shego, if it's all in one central location.  no more bumpy transatlantic flights.  because there won't be an atlantic.  one ocean, one continent, and best of all, one time zone.  well, i do need to set my watch.  the next time i'm in miami, i can walk nextdoor to morocco and buy a carpet.  you'll never get away with this, drakken.  what. why. what do you know.  it just seemed like the thing to say.   hi. may i help you.  uhhuh.  what are you sketching, rufus.  kim's new mission outfit.  yup.  i think you're on to something.  hey, are you gonna order anything.  ..  for two hours.  hmm, ron a noshow on a 3for1 chimirito day.  drakken: ooh, look at how the continents fit together like a puzzle.  drakken, was brilliant enough to see it.  you know, the earth used to be like that a few hundred million years ago.  what. it's been done before.  i missed it on a test, or was it the only one i got right.  pangaea. hmm. i don't want to copy.  i'll call it drakkengaea. yes. ha ha.  what. it works.   phone on vibrate tickles.  hee hee. k.p., stop calling.  i can't take it.  hey, kimmy, your boyfriend says not to call him anymore.  shego and drakken have ron.  i need a trace on ron's cell phone.  easy. i can do that with one hand.  a place called international continentalthat's the college ron was touring today.  running a geothermal scan now.  hydraulics, magnetics, tectonic censorseverything drakken and shego stole in the last 48 hours.  looks like i've got a new college to visit.  glad you're not letting your fashion disaster take your head out of the game.  not when ron needs me, mission gear or no mission gear.  monique: how about new mission gear.  mmhmm. surprise.  it's almost done charging.  3, 2, 1.  since we're counting, i count 1oh, no2 losers.  kim possible.  . hey, sweet mission threads.  the look actually works, and it totally bugs me to have to say it.  and i can't wait to break them in.  neither can i.  hyah. uh.  nice, k.p. how's it feel.  like i'm back.  it's working, shego.  yeah. i'm as shocked as you.  ron: aah.  what's that thing supposed to do.  merge all the continents into one.  you mean like pangaea.  drakkengaea.   , you did build this place to seismic standards, didn't you.  seismic standards.  for the shaking, as entire continents move.  it's always one tiny detail. aah.   ohh.   hhey.  you think your new mission clothes are all that.   but they are not.  say, um, thanks for the save, kim.  i'm not sure what would have happened if you hadn't gotten captured.  that's what i'm here for, k.p.  one more mission to gothe college admission uh, mission.  ron: hey, a question about pangaea. shh.  so we're dying to know.  did you apply to my alma mater. or mine.  um, actually, neither.  ron: but i did.  ron applied to every college.  every college in the country.  ron: playing the odds.  and, kimmy, what about you.  well, medical school was perfect for you, mom, but i've got to ..  mojo.  mojo. is that a state school.  actually, drakken sort of gave me the idea.  drakken.  "hong kong". "london". "venice".  i've saved it over and over.  well, we couldn't be prouder.  ron: i've got to send out more applications, a lot more.  captioning made possible bydisney abc cable networks group so we get youthe orange jumpsuits, and you get us outof laundry duty. done.  kim: and you're done, too.  got the entirebribe on tape.  this is an outrage.  don't do the timeif you can't do the crime, or something like that.  i meant yourmission clothes.  woman in hood:yeah. that's our design.  kim: uh, gotto go. bye.  captioning performed bythe national captioning institute, inc.  captioning made possible byabc cable networks group  todd and riley were, oh, so sad    then they came 'cross a fleemco ad   98    got a superspy mom and a daredevil dude of a dad    replacements    the replacements    who are sly and deny and defy them    and make things bad    hello, fleemco.  sir, we needa replacement.  and fast.   and anytime they wanna make a change    modify and rearrange    though it might get kinda strange    make 'em better, nice and strong    smart and cool and maybe even lame    call in the replacements    replacements   ..   ..    replacements   ..   ladies and gentlemen.  riley and her amazing dancing mule.     no, no, it's heeltoe steptoe, not toetoe heeltoe.  ugh. who knew a mule could be so stubborn.   oh. that voice. it's heavenly.  there's an angel in our bathroom.  maybe we can catch him and sell him to a zoo.   all: aah.  todd's the angel. we can't sell him.  can we.  todd, dear, those were your dulcet tones.  don't judge me.  no, todd, we're saying you have an excellent voice.  really. cool.  i've always liked to sing, butyeah, yeah, yeah, that's great.  now let's get back to my show.  the big girl and mule talent show is next week, and this is one talent contest i actually have a chance to win.  son, you know, you sing like a pro.  you should be on a stage.  nah, that' too nerdy.  nerdy.  the point is,you have a gift.  and you should shareit with the world.  ok, ok, i will.  the first opportunity i get.  golly. then what about boys choir at school.  ..  why, that's a perfect idea.  i can't do that. it's for losers.  todd, let me get this straight.  you won't do something you love just because it isn't cool.  mom, i know you can be very persuasive.  but you can't make me sing     sing   happy, mom. over.  you'll thank me for this later, dear. over.  very nice, boys.  you sing like angels.  which is why i'm going to dress you like them.  i am not wearing a dress.  they're not dresses, they're gowns.  now what's your dress size.  i'm a size 4.  i'd like to see the day you get me in that outfit.  well, you're in luck.  tomorrow's the day.  you'll be singing in the school assembly.  yeah, i don't think so.  i have this thing about getting my butt kicked, and that thing is, i don't like it. i quit.  mom: not so fast, young man.  your father and i have already bought tickets.    ahh   all right, choir dorks, i gotta be somewhere, so let's get this bullying started.  choir dorks. where.  i wanna pound some song nerds.  uh, nice try, singy mcsingalong.
