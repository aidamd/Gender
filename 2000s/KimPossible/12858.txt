 so many sitches, so little time.   how many times do i have to say it.  home time is my time, doubly so at bath time.  barkin, please, you have to give me another flour baby.  you blew the assignment already.  it's only been two hours.  to be fair, it wasn't entirely ron's fault.  there were extenuating circumstances.  uhoh. no, no, no.   the intruder sacked sackie.  i don't know what that means, but here. i'm running out of hot water.  you won't regret it, sir.  ..   ii.  sackie eyeeye.  it's roman numerals, k.p.  it adds the aristocratic touch.  whoa. whoa.  it all happened so fast.  i know, but one smile from hana, and you'll..   ii.  enough with the roman numerals.  besides, you only had sackie 2 for, like, two seconds.  have you a heart of stone, woman.   right.  how do you plan to break the news to yori that we're a thing now.  "thing." you mean a couple.  i'm sure that she's gotten over me, i mean, to the degree that any girl can.   uh, right. full disclosure. got it.  it is a great relief to see you, stoppablesan.  always good to see you, yori.  ahem.  i mean, we can see each other as long as it's clear that we're not seeing each other.  i don't know what that means, but i'm still glad you're here.  lord monkey fist and his monkey ninjas struck again last night.  ron: why does monkey fist always have to use monkey ninjas.  i mean, bunny ninjas would be a nice change of pace.  hey.  so this is a real mission.  same stoppablesan with his inappropriate clownishness.   yeah.  a scroll containing a prophesy of a powerful mystic weapon was in this place.  only sensei knows the weapon's secrets and location, but he's away and cannot be reached.  if monkey fist gains the weaponwe'll have your scroll out of that monkey's fists in no time.  cryptic and encrypted.  the nature of the weapon is uncertain, but the scroll's first section directs us ..  to the yellow shrine of napata.   follow me.  there.  the first key to the secrets of the weapon.  get it.   oh. must i do everything myself.  ooh.  aah.  eee.  ooh. aah.  eee.  the location of the second key and a clue to the very nature of the weapon.  kim: really. you could use a clue.  oh, look. the cheer squad.  stoppablesan, we must get that key.  don't worry, yori. you can count on me.  she can count on you, ron, but not for everything, right.  yori: what are you saying.   aah.  aah. eee.  ron, maybe you should tell yori the big news.  what. oh. you mean the intruder.  not that news.  oh. right. ok, sorry. sorry. sorry.  so, see, i got this new assignment in health class.  ron.  yori, the thing is, kim and i, we're not just friends anymore.  we're kind of, well, dating.  i see.  totally didn't mean to break your heart or anything.  i believe my heart is intact.  does everyone have a heart of stone these days.  sensei teaches that change is a part of life and leads to growth, wisdom, and happiness.  ron: yeah, who doesn't love change, but you can admit to a little emotion sickness if you want.  ron, she said she's ok with it.  so the drama.  whoa. whoa.  i'd love to stay and see who winds up with who, but i really have to run. tata.  this is unfortunate.  good morning, mom.  kimmy, have you seen the pancake mix.  you're making

give you a third chance.  i'm not a proud man, kim.  but, listen, mucho serious development.  monkey fist. duh. no.  this morning, the little creature spit up in my backpack.  no one spits up in my backpack, except rufus and occasionally me.  so now there's what, like 18 more years of this torture.  ron, i don't think she'll still be spitting up when she's 18.  why can't the ..   iii.  you mean

now, what does that mean.  look out.   that's what i get for letting the monkey drive.  ron: looks like wade was right. this is it.  what if monkey fist has already come and gone with the blue key.  one way to find out.  the scroll warns that as the yellow shrine was guarded by sand, the blue shrine is guarded by stone.  so why risk myself and my monkeys when i can get team possible to find the traps for me.  ha ha ha ha.  we beat monkey fist.  yeah, unless ugly here already ate him.    hey, hey. just kidding.  you are one handsome grotesque, no intense offended.  or, i mean, aah.  now,
