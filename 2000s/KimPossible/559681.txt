captioning sponsored by the u.s. department of education and abc cable networks group  the kimber diamond. it's gone.   so, how much does a piece of ice like that go for.  the kimber diamond is the most flawless gem in the world.  its value is beyond any estimation.  i'm going to throw out a number250 bucks.  sir, i really don't think...  $275.  am i getting warmer.  cool.  whatwhat is it.  wade: hair.  canine hair, but not just any dog.  this follicle comes from a lithuanian wolfhound, one of the rarest breeds on earth.  and what would one of these dogs want with a diamond.  why don't we focus on the person who owns the dog, ron.  that's just what the dog burglar wants you to do.  wade: got it.  falsetto jones, the only breeder of lithuanian wolfhounds in the world.  he's rich, refined and possibly the world's greatest thief.  falsetto is the number one suspect in a lot of bigtime robberies, but they can never pin anything on him.  so, he's no ordinary cat burglar...  dog burglar.  come on, kim, get your head in the game.  wade: bad newshis estate is crawling with security.  no weak spots.  good newstomorrow night, falsetto hosts his annual open dog show.  so all we need to get inside...  ...is a show dog.  yes, my gigi has atrs sensitivetummy, mais non.  now, you must remember to feed her only two parts champion gourmet wet food, one part champion gourmet dry

bad.  relax, kp, there's plenty of mucho galleta cheesetillas.   kim: ron, what were you thinking.  feeding bueno nacho to a champion show dog.   ron: ah, rufus downs this stuff all the time.  he's cool.  news flash, ronrufus is a rat, not a champion show dog  gigi is in no condition to enter a dog show and we land in 15.  any ideas.  heh.   all right, we're gonna pull this off.  you're gonna have to look dog, act dog and think dog. got it.  woof.  okay. now, do as i do.   okay, sit.  thanks.  woof. woof.   woof.     ah...  i'm sorry, what breed did you say this was.  um, a... peruvian...  hairless.  huh.  i'm still not seeing anything here in the official...  maybe you should consult with my friend mr.  lincoln.  see if he can improve your eyesight a bit, if you, you know, catch my drift.  ron.  this is a prestigious international competition.  and i'm speaking the prestigious international language of cold, hard cash.  five dollars is hardly...  man: ah... yes... here it is.  a hairless peruvian, very good.   there he is, falsetto jones.  ron: why do you think he's called "falsetto".  : welcome humans and canines alike to my annual dog show.  freak helium accident.  ouch. i need time to infiltrate the main house.  try to keep a low profile.  you got it. low pro.  good dog.  i'm liking the stealth suit, wade.  knew you would, kim.  and the pond is filled with...  don't tell me. sharks. crocs.  electric eels, actually.  the badvillain puns just write themselves.  shocking, isn't it.  announcer: and now the toy group is being led onto the floor by their handlers.  man 1: uh. what is that entrant that looks like a bald rodent.  man 2: i'm told that's a peruvian hairless.  very rare, it's quite exciting to have one in this year's show.  man 1: well, let's see how the judges like it.   hey.  heh. you gotta admire that kind of spirit in such a small dog.  of course, there's a time for spirit and a time for laying low.   i'm in.  man 2: let's see who it'll be.  this judgeistaking his time.  clearly a tough decision.  and it's the peruvian hairless taking the toy group.  hey.   man 1: and in his first show ever, huh.  it's quite an upset.  and he'll move on to the finals.  who's the dog.  if i were a flawless diamond, where would i hide.  blueprints show some kind of vault deep under the house.  on my way. i...   oh, that's quite an animal you have there, mr....  the name's van foker dumple  stein.  doctorvan foker dumple  stein, actually.  funny, in all my years of hosting this show, i've never seen anything quite like him.  well, as i'm sure you know, the groovy hairless...  peruvian hairless.  yes. he's practically one of a kind.  i feel compelled to ask you a question, dr. foker dumple  stein fire away.  can i have your autograph.  hey.

treat planned for you two.  i think you'll find this quite shocking.  called that one.  he's getting away.  man 2: the finalists are on the floor...  all except for the peruvian hairless.  man 1: wait.  there he is now.   come and get it.   man 2: and it appears we have pandemonium on the floor.  uh...  aren't you going to leave now.  leave. what do you mean.  oh, usually the bad guy says his lame pun and then walks out, you know, leaving us to our doom.  but then i'd miss the whole thing.  where's the fun in that.  i'm not going anywhere.  okay, but i feel i must warn you, that you're really breaking a supervillain tradition here.   hey.   ooh, oh, stop, that really, really tickles.  get them.  hi.  show's over, kim possible.  so not.  jump.  okay, you can hit the button for the parachute any time now.  sorry, no parachute.  no parachute..  hit it, sam.  the peruvian hairless saves the day.  rufus is definitely best in show.  . call me, beep me if you want to reach me .  .
