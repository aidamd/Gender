  tweebs.   jim, tim.  we just wanted to know what was in that hose.  why. because it was there.  it was hydraulic fluid.  and what better way to find out.     oh.  ooh.    come on.  : gotcha.     we're alive.  hmm.  you have some reallynasty breath there, rufus.  yeah, lay off the blue cheese, will you, buddy.   dr. bortal: kim possible.  thank you for coming.  i'm dr. syrus bortal.  what happened to the pilot.  overexposure. to what.  them.  jim: a secret lab.  check it out.  those two in a topsecret lab.  this could be a bigger threat to the free world than drakken.  not "could be." definitely.    both: shego.  mmhmm, shego.  dr. bortal.  boys, please.  here we go.  that's a very delicate piece of equipment called a...  a silicon phase disrupter.  how did you know that.  we're making one, too.  except mine is real.  both: so is ours.  a handheld unit.  it simply is not possible.  anything's possible.  for a possible.  : boys, boys, boys.  you know, when i was a boy i liked to make believe i was making rocket ships and blaster rays.  wedomake rockets...  ...andblaster rays.  hmph. such cute lads.   doctor, what exactly was in the safe.  my latest projectthe neurocompliance chip.  mmhmm... let's pretend i don't know what that is.  it's a microcomputer that overrides the brain and the nervous system.  total mind control.  um, i don't think so.  that would be, like, ferociously unethical.  dr. bortal would not invent something like that.  right.   well...  "ferociously unethical" is a little harsh.  drakken has total mind control power.   oh, man.  yet another "take over the world" thing.  that, or he's going to force people to listen to those stories about his twisted childhood.  then, in fourth grade, i developed a ray that allowed me to control rubber products.  they said i was mad, but after that no one could best me in foursquare, tetherball, dodgeball.  isn't that fascinating.  fascinating, dr. drakken.  want to hear more scintillating stories from my formative years, hmm.  yes, dr. drakken.  no time.  i have to make more chips if i want the whole world to be blindly obedient to meand you know i do, shego.  yes, dr. drakken.  dr. bortal: ms. possible ms. possible, ms. possible, please.  our security officer searched the lab already.  they don't have spectrometer sunglasses.   fascinating. where did you get those.  tenyearold supergenius.  your brothers.  : sonot.   got something.  maybe.  hmm. wade, are you getting this.  itit's a leaf... or a piece of one.  oh, from the quoalatuk fir.  and i'm betting they don't grow in the desert.  they don't growanywhere...  except at the foot of tishu falls in the peruvian rain forest.  okay. so, we go to peru, find drakken grab the compliance chip and get the tweebs back home before dinner.  where are the tweebs.     you guys totally embarrassed me back there.  what was up with that.  we were trying to fix the doctor's phase disrupter.  was it even broken.  no, it was lame.  isn't time to pull our chutes.  no way, free falling is cool.  kim.  whoa.  i see... water.  textscan it, wade.  getting anything.  huge energy readings... halfway up.  there's probably an entrance behind the falls.  thanks, wade.  why are the entrances never just, you know, like, a door.  okay, ron.  i'll infiltrate drakken's lair and get the chip.  you keep an eye on the tweebs.  oh, sure giveme the dangerous assignment.  we want to go, too.  yeah.  we could be backup.  okay...  back up.  don't touch anything.  mitrometer.  : yes, dr. drakken.  nanoweld resister.  yes, dr. drakken.  i love this.  hand me a fork.  yes, dr. drakken.   : get me a dodo bird.  yes, dr. drakken.    sike. dodo birds are extinct.  ah, i'm being silly.  there, i'm already done.  a new compliance chip.  isn't it lovely.  yes, it is lovely.  can't you show a little more enthusiasm.  hoorah.  kim possible.  how did she get so close.  why didn't you tell me.  i was looking for a dodo bird.  wait.  this is delicious.   hello.    i'm bored.  bored is good.  bored is safe.  no, it's not. it's boring.  kim's taking forever.  we should go up there and see what's going on.  huh. hyah. unh. unh. hyah.  huh.   kim said to stay put.  well, kim's not here.  yes, i am.  kim, why are you dressed like shego.  : that is not important.  okay...  so where's the chip.  on her forehead.   dr. drakken will see you now.  hoosha.  hold my naked mole rat, boys.  i'm going in.  give me the chip. where's this hand go.  where's this hand go.  you watching this hand.   ooh. ow.  did you really think it would be that easy.  well, i hoped.  dr. drakken has ordered the capture of ron stoppable.  he remembered my name.  initiate big sister capture sequence.  and we can't even get in trouble.  get ady.  alleyoop.  gotcha.  you captured kim possible.  no big. no big.  hickabickaboo.  hoosha.  ron: you know, guys...    if kim were here...   huh.  must capture ron stoppable.  must capture ron stoppable.  must capture ron stoppable.  if kim were here and not under drakken's control she'd cook up a plan.  a plan, mmhmm.  let yourself get captured.  a plan that doesn't involve that.  drakken doesn't know about us. he ordered kim to get you.  so that's all she cares about.  let her take you into his lair. we'll follow.  oh, and get the communicator.  to call for help.  good plan, mmmm, yeah.  no.  we take the power cell out of the communicator...  and put it in...  our silicon phase disrupter...  which will jam the control frequency of that chip.  that's why bortal had a disrupter in his lab.  to override the chip.  this finishing each other's sentences thing is really freaking me out.  here she comes. go.   what up, kim.  so, how's the whole mind control thing working out.  you must be taken to dr. drakken.   shego: you are very smart.  and look good in this light.  fine, shego, don't wear it out.  dr. drakken you are very smart.  and look good in this light.  now, see,shesells it.  so, kim possible you climbed down the waterfall and captured your very best friend.  i like this mind control thing very much.  kim: yes, dr. drakken.  good.  now go secure the perimeter or something.  what about the hairless rodent.  stop.   give me that.  good.  now, shego, kim destroy that little bald thing.  uhoh. huh.  who are you.  the kid who's going to bring you down.  oh, really.  you and what arm...  hoosha.  a clone.  yeah, that's right, loser.  shego. kim.  forget about the rodent.  get those little clones.   stall them. right. okay.  which door. which door.   wrong door.   don't look down.  don't look down.  don't look...    ha. ha.   oh, no, oh, no, pain.  ooh, please, no.  everybody stop.  i'm on to you. you're not clones.  you're just gardenvariety twins.  you don't give the orders here.  i do if i've got a silicon phase disrupter.  a silicon phase disrupter. really.  hoosha. wait.  how could two little boys carry a silicon phase disrupter up the cliff.  it's portable.  : portable.   oh, you really had me going there a moment.  hickabickaboo.  hickabickaboo.   uh...  hmm.  uhoh.   portable silicon phase disrupter.  i knew it couldn't be done.  are you sure the battery's in right.  the plus goes with the plus thing and the little slash goes with the other...  not plus.  nice outfit.  nice apron.  okay, doc.  for future reference, the chip made me obey every command but i was aware of exactly what was happening.  the whole time.  dodge ball and dodos..  ooh.  do you have any idea what listening to you is like..  it is so boring.  shouldn't we go after them.  nah, whatever shego's going to do to drakken is ten times worse than anythi i could come up with.  i'm sure jim and tim could think of something cruel and unusual.  i think jim and tim have come up with enough ideas for one day.  and every one of them rocked.  for tweebs, you guys are pretty amazing.  oh...  ew, gross.  are you feeling okay.  come on. let's get out here.   hey, everybody, good news.  our marriage is stronger than ever.  and we caught a mess of trout.  it looks like somebody took very good care of her little brothers.  aw... when they're asleep like this they hardly seem evil at all. )
