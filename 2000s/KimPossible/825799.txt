 just doing my job, ned.  hello. kim to ron.  you didn't even want this job.  i didn't know what i wanted, kim.  i was lost... adrift in the wilderness.  but that was then.  now... i belong.  i belong to bueno nacho.   58, your order's great.  59, lookin' fine.  ..   your food's ready.   go, wade.  check this out.  highly unusual...  what are you doing.  kimba, ixnay on the communicator.  the nacho cheese needs some love.  ron, we might have a lead on drakken.  drakken... nachos.  i'm going to have to go with drakken.  well, that kind of 'tude is narrowing the race for employee of the month.  the race is between you and you.  both: sometimes i feel like i don't even know you anymore.  kim: rufus...  cheese.   cheese.  e.  uhhuh.  even you can push a button, right.  good little naked mall rat.  sorry, wade, but the employee of the month cut us off.  seismic activity in wisconsin.  quake in the midwest.  major red flag.  it gets weirder.  the epicenter is the world's biggest cheese wheel.  let me try something.  police report from the cheese wheel mall shows a breakin at the club banana store.  i don't get the connection.  only one thing was stolen:..  green leathersheego.  ned, i've got to switch shifts.  something suddenly came up.  whatever.  what's with you.  go ask your new boss.  new boss.  corporate love the naco.  oh, really.  they see big things in my futura.  good for you.  now, let's go.  drakken's in wisconsin.  but your shift isn't over.  ron, an evil wacko is in the dairy state with a giant laser drill.  i'm going...  and i was hoping you'd come with.  to be your sidekick.  that's what this is all about, isn't it.  you just can't stand that i'm better than you at something.  you wouldn't even have this stupid job if i didn't fill out your application.  kim, we could argue all day but that's not going to get this floor mopped.  mop it yourself, boss.  and find a new nacho drone, i quit.  yeah. well, find a new sidekick.  what are you looking at.  i want that floor to sparkle.  kim: mom, reassure me.  i just had a fight with ron.  he was all high horse 'cause i bailed on work and i really need to stop drakken but ron thinks i quit because i can't take him being good at something which would be way pathetic.  i need a suture here.  mom, do you have me on speaker.  sorry, honey, i got both hands on a 62yearold's temporal lobe.  mom..  got to go, honey.  see you at dinner.  dad's picking up nacos.   kim: i can't tell you how much i appreciate this, mr. parker.  after the way you saved my cropdusting business i'm only too happy to help.  no big.  going organic was a total nobrainer.  get ready.  now.  funky.  a cheesecovered building.  woman: many people assume this is a cheesecovered building.  in fact, this marvel of dairyproduct architecture is a 100% pure wisconsin swiss.  hey, look.  who cut the cheese.   i know. i know.  okay, points for a bizarre hiding place.  wait, get this.  i'm inside the cheese wheel.  which, surprisingly, is not a cheesecovered building.  it's 100% wisconsin swiss.  so i've heard.  drakken's got the whole mad scientist lair thing here.  they love the high ceilings.  kim, look in your pack.  a hair dryer.  i'm more of the toweloff type.  it only looks like a hair dryer.  hey.  you rock, wade.  drakken: increase the drill's power.  i want to reach that magma.  welcome, kimmy.  may i take your coat.  you already did.  don't worry.  it'll look better on me.   face it, pumpkin.  fashion isn't the only thing in which i'm a step ahead.   comfy.  not particularly.  good.  well, well kim possible.  how nice to see you again especially now that you're helpless to stop me.  shall i tell you my plan.  it's quite impressive.  you're using the world's most powerful laser drill to tap into the molten magma deep beneath the earth's crust.  ah, that's phase one.  in phase twowhich you did not guessmy magma machine will melt the entire state of wisconsin which i will then rebuild and rename drakkenville.  you're so conceited.  i'll take that as a compliment.  sheego.  how long.  the alarm will go off when we hit magma.  you see. any second now i will strike swiftly and without mercy.  actually, make it more like a half hour.  fine. whatever.  in roughly 30 minutes wisconsin will surrender to me and the kingdom of drakkenville will be born.  say it with me. drakkenville.  does that have a nice ring to it.   hey surfers, we're going behind the scenes  of the latest disney movie.  .movie surfers..   i've seen its power with my own eyes.   releasing the sand turns back time.   from disney, producer jerry bruckheimer,  and director mike newell, did you see that.  see what.   prince of persia: the sands of time is an epic adventure  that tells the story of prince dastan and his quest  to protect the mysterious dagger of time.   the movie's star jake gyllenhaal did all  kinds of stunts including parkour.   it's so exciting to watch, jumping and bouncing  off walls and off ceilings.   what is parkour. wecaught up with stunt coordinator  george aguilar on the set in morocco to find out.   well, parkour is about using your environment to get  from point a to point b.  if it's a rope, you use a rope.if it's a wall, you use a wall.   it's just about using anything you can to an extreme.  that's impossible.  difficult, not impossible.  so when surfers watch the movie, what scene can they look at that was actually influenced by parkour training.   well, there's a scene where jake is running through  a dark tunnel being chased.  he runs up the walls  of the tunnel and jumps and takes him off the horse.  then they have a swordfight.   so he does everything in that one scene.   after seeing some of jake's amazing moves,  we thought it was time for us to give parkour a try.  let's go surfers.  you won't want to miss this.   so we met up with forrest, a parkour expert who taught us  all the right moves.   yes.   here we go.  i love this.   good job.  it's nothing.  well surfers, this is just a taste of what jake had to go through for his training, but you can  check out all the amazing stunt work when leaps into theatres soon.  find him.  that's all you got.  ron: ned.  these customers have been waiting for over 30 seconds.  33, 34...andale.  here, have a .10 day.  wade: ron.  welcome to bueno nacho.  may i take your order.  ron, it's wade.  wade, where are you.  not important.  kim's in trouble.  she found drakken inside a giant cheese wheel but i lost contact.  she needs help. your help.  well, well, well.  looks like you've got a choice to make.  what's more important, your sacred duty as assistant manager or your pathetic role as goofy sidekick.   well, that's no choice at all.  i guess it's time to say buenas noches, bueno nacho.   don't bother.  the midwest is about to receive a molten calling card from a certain dr. drakken.  sheego, i'm still waiting.  so, read a magazine. i'm working.  excuse me. i have to go make a scene.   ron: questionis this some kind of cheesecovered building.  you know, you'd be surprised by how many people think that.  drakken: can't you drill any faster.  i built an entire army of evil robots in the time it's taken you to penetrate the earth's crust.  ron.  everything's okay, kim.  i'm here to save the day.  sheego: hi.  is that tie a clipon.   guess that wasn't much of a plan.  not as great as your bueno nacho bathroom break chart.  i gooned on assistant manager power.  you were right.  i did resent your superior burrito technique.  you're entitled to excel.  forgive me.  duh... forgive me.  totally.  aww, that's so sweet.  friends again, just in time to be fried in magma.  remind me again why r.   the drill's into the magma.  about time.  activate the magmachine.  that would be so cool if it wasn't going to hurt us.  show time.  deploy the barrel and activate the magmapump.   ow.   kim: rufus push the button.  mmhmm.    oh.  ooh.  ron, get to the laser drill.  i'll take care of sheego.  great plan.  what exactly is the plan again.  ron, you're the genius who invented the "naco." you've got a building made of cheese here.  get creative.  it will be my masterpiece.
