 so, why don't we start with a tour of the space center.  you can meet our newest astronaut.  i'd like you all to meet the special new addition to our space crew...  frederick.     : welcome, friends.  hey, how come he uses that box thingy to talk.  i think you'll like this, boys and girls.  you see, frederick isn't a human astronaut.  he's a...  monkey.    come play.  no monkey touch. no monkey touch.  what's his problem.  long story shortron had a bad summer camp experience.  he didn't get along with the monkey mascot.       hmm.    frederick, friend.    rufus...  hmm.   i think he likes you.  well, i don't like him back.  i'm out of here. are you coming.  hang on.  i'm going to tell my dad straight up that i am too old for this.  dad...  there's my girl.  you know, it doesn't get any better than this.  me, you, a deep connection.  so, what's up.  um, i, i have to....  show ron something.  father: this spacecraft is being prepared for a special mission.   frederick is going to spend a year at our space station monitoring experiments from elementary school students around the country.    what's going on here.  a prophecy is being fulfilled.   leo:" amy: brought to you by

said dad.  just flaking on him is so flawed.  some things are better left unsaid, k.p.  especially when there's a monkey in the immediate vicinity.  forget about the monkey.  i'm trying, but that's hard to do as long as we stay here.  look, i've got to go back.  i'll suck it up and tell him i'm too old for the rocket boosters.  or, you could write him a letter.  everybody loves to get mail.  mmhmm.  come on, ron.    that's weird.   locked.  it's a sign.  someone's trying to tell us to stick with my plan.  put distance between us and the monkey.  interesting theory, but doubt it.  let's try the side door.   kim: where is everybody.  something's definitely not right.  wade, we're outside the space center.  the doors are locked.  can you see if anything is going on.  i'm on it.  hmm.  hmm...  there is no need for alarm.  i have come for frederick.  but he can't leave.  frederick is a highly trained astronaut.  he's due for a mission.  oh, i know, doctor.  and i shall accompany him.  the space center's computer system is being jammed, kim.  i think something's up.  come on, ron.  we've got to get a look inside.  whoa.  take a picture.  it'll last longer.  you've got hairy hands.  and the feet to match.  cool.  there's nothing cool about stealing a spacecraft.  oh, really. that's right.  in fact, i'd have to say it's quite whack.  doctor, i am guided by the ancient prophesy of the mystical monkey monk.  i am not whack.  my dear frederick, it has been foretold that you would lead us to the stars.  destiny awaits us.   frederick stay.  frederick, you cannot fight destiny.  it's just not done.  otherwise, things here could get very ugly.  understand.  frederick go. friends safe.  well done.  it's monkey fist.  what's he doing in middleton.  he's working with that traitor, frederick.  i told you, k.p., never trust a monkey.  wade, monkey fist is inside mission control.  we need a way in and fast.  can you access blueprints.  you're talking highly classified information, kim.  there's layers upon layers of encryption and...   i'm in.  looks like your best bet is through an air vent on the roof.  isn't it always.  any attempt to follow us will be dealt with severely.  from the space station, we will rule the world.  ooh... ha.  aah...ha.  oh, the weapons there must be incredible.  there are no weapons on the space station.  it's dedicated to peaceful research.  now that is whack.  oh, well, no matter.  the prophecy clearly states frederick must lead us there.  so it was foretold, so it shall be.    some tools would be nice.  well, i've got smoke pellets, uh, lip gloss, and, uh, today's history homework.  ooh, i wouldn't mind a look at that.  ron.  okay, okay.  rufus, you're on.  booya.  which way.  i just can't wait to be the ultimate monkey master.  kim possible...  and her monkey phobic friend.  what are you doing here.  it's the rocket boosters' open house.  they have these rocketshaped cookies...  we came to stop you, monkey fist.   well, i'm afraid not.  monkey ninjas attack.  hoo... yah.    after him.   you'll never make it out of the space center.  on the contrary.  my transportation is all arranged.  now if you'll excuse me.   farewell, kim possible.  come.    monkeys. monkeys.   monkeys.  got to hide. got to hide. got to hide.   safe for now.  must be some kind of science lab.   uhoh.  what was that.  why is the room moving.  computer voice: initiation sequence complete.  monkey fist: strap yourselves in.  frederick, you take the pilot's seat.  launch in tminus 60 seconds.  we're locked out.  that's monkey man's overwritten the main control system.  we can't halt the launch.  ten... nine...  eight... seven... at last.  our time is at hand.  frederick.  frederick.   no. come back.  this is not following the prophecy.  man, that's loud.  we must be close to the rocket.  huh.  . as the bell rings .   4, 3, 2let's go.  let's go.  . dada .  . dada dada .   . dada .  . as the bell rings .  . dada .  . dada dada .  . dada .   so you really think you could help me hook up my laptop.  it's just your basic power cord to the usb wireless router, then reset the modem and check your network setting.  if you say so.  so i'll swing by your house around 7.  great. oh.  but call first.  my cousin from russia is in town, and he has a very overprotective dog named bear.  then we'll make that connection.  hey, brooke.  i just heard the most incredible thing.  really. do tell.  skipper and lexi are getting together, and now she thinks her overprotective cousin from russia is going to chase him with a bear named dog.  wow. that is incredible.  just keep that to yourself.  uh, no problem.   danny, you're never gonna believe what i heard last period.  try me.  okay, but it's top secret.  skipper's dog was stolen by an overprotective cousin, and lexi's taking him to russia, and they're joining the circus to train dancing bears, andthey're getting married.  married. skipper and lexi in russia.  yeah, sorry, buddy.  and remember, don't tell anyone.  hi, danny, what's up.  oh, i know what's up.  i know all about you and skipper running away to get married in russia so you can help your cousin get a job in the circus dancing with bears.  what are you talking about.  it's simple.  all danny is saying is that skipper is coming to your house to hook up his new computer, but he should call first because your cousin from russia is in town, and he has a very overprotective dog named bear.  oh. that would make more sense.  ya think.  well, anyway, um, have fun hooking up skipper's computer.  thanks.  oh, andudachi.  that means "good luck" in russian.  hey, toejam, have you heard.  skipper's lucky new computer can magically transport you to some place calledudachi.  where's that.  i'm not sure, but i think it's in russia.  keep that to yourself.  no problem.   poor frederick.  don't worry, dad.  he's right here.  kimmie. what happened. dad.  thank goodness you're all right.  well, i was on my way to talk to you when we ran into monkey fist.  doctor possible, we're getting something on the spider cam.  the what.  the camera in the science bay monitoring the spider habitat.   spiders. get them off me.  get them off me.  ron. dad, you have to turn that rocket around.  it's okay. the spiders are harmless.  hello. ron's hurtling into space with lord monkey fist.  that's harm city.  ah, yes, well, we can't turn it around.  thisismission control, right.  it was. that monkey man changed all systems to manual control.  then we have to go and get him.  impossible.  even if there were a trained crew, we don't have a spacecraft available.  well, that's not completely accurate.  kim: sweet.  dad, you designed this ship yourself.  i had some free time.  of course, you realize it's completely experimental.  trust me. this baby will move.  that's good enough for me.  thanks, honey, i...  wait. good enough for what.  i'm going.  absolutely not.  an unproven ship is no place for my kimmie cub.  look, dad, i've been up the amazon and down a volcano.  i dogsledded through the arctic swam the english channel, scaled mount everest, not to mention acing the cheerleading regionals.  but you don't have the training to pilot a spacecraft.  he does.   frederick go. frederick help.  but we haven't even begun to calculate the launch vectors.  not to mention all the other variables in a docking mission.  did you get that, wade.  yeah. by the time you rev it up, i'll have all relevant vectors and flight trajectories downloaded into the space center computers.  ah, you continue to rock, wade.  dad...  i haven't had the heart to tell you, but newsflash: i'm a big girl.  just because i'm growing up doesn't mean you'll stop being my dad.  prepare for launch.  all settled in there.  roger, dad.  systems go.  we're nearing the space station.  frederick reduce booster jets to match speed.  roger.   docking complete.  come on. stupid door.   all right, rufus. you cracked the code.  well, if it isn't the boy who detests monkeys.  get your stinking paws off me, you filthy monkey.   ow.  now what.  kim.  why did you bring him.  he's got to be working with monty freak.  ron, frederick risked his life to come.  if it wasn't for him, i wouldn't be here.  really.  hello, ron.  you came to help me.  frederick friend.  : frederick has come back.  oh, yes.  the prophecy is back on track.  i will be the ultimate monkey master.  monkey fist, get a life.   bring it on.   monkey ninjas, attack.    whoa.     whoa.  whoa.  huh.  what is happening.  artificial gravity off.  frederick, you are the man.   frederick, now.  roger.   nice work, boys.  let's go home, buddy.  ron go, frederick stay.  what do you mean.  frederick has job.  he's been training for this mission for a long time, ron.  it's only right that he sees it through.  but that means he'll stay up here for a year.  frederick miss ron.  i'll email you every day.  since when do you know how to fly a spacecraft.  it's no big. i watched frederick on the way up.   welcome, back, kimmie. you were great.  oh, kim, i want to be just like you when i grow up.  okay, i admit it. she's grown up.  not completely, dad.  true.  which means that we've got some new rules to cover.  number oneno boys.  ever.  number twodriving.  ha. forget it.  number three...  but i was to be the ultimate monkey master.  i was to be unstoppable.  dude, it's not happening. get used to it.  monkey ninjas, attack.  monkeywhat.  his legion of monkey ninjas.  we captured them too.  umhmm.  sorry pal, there are no monkey ninjas onboard.  i taught them the way of the ninja, and now they abandon me.  no.  so the monkey ninjas just vanished.  coocoo.   um, hello.  this is a little embarrassing.  but i must correct one thing in my last message.  apparently, some of us don't write very clearly.  anyway, when i said the leader of the monkey ninjas would be unstoppable, what i should have said was that the leader will be ron stoppable.  my bad.  hope that didn't cause too much confusion.  okay, this is starting to get weird.  i know, but i can't get rid of them.   captioning sponsored by
