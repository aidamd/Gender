"corey's solo careerphat or flat." not remotely helpful.  oh. save me that nochip nails article, would you.   hey, you try keeping a manicure while kung fuing it out with teen heroes all day.  nah, kim possible must have a weakness.  everyone has a weakness.  all we need to do is find it.  huh. "what's you shy q."  shego, we're working here.  or "unlock the true you." a personality quiz.  number one.  "when i'm crushing hard on someone, "i let them know by, a) a flirty email, b) romantic gifts." i don't know, i'd probably employ some kind of mindcontrol device on them.  charming. i'll check "other." number two: "my most embarrassing moment happened when..." i don't have the faintest.  oh, puhleeze.  how about just last week when kim possible gave you that flying kung fu wedgie and you were all, like, "shego, help me, help me".  or there's that time...  silence.  there will be no more talk of embarrassing moments.  all right, but check outthesefeatures.  "my most humiliating moment ever." "embarrassment central." "i could have died from embarrassment." let me see that.  "could have died from embarrassment." hmm... that's it.  that's it, shego.  what is.  embarrassment.  the soft, white underbelly of the teen ego.  ew.  kim: i'm telling you, i was this close to josh manke asking me out.  you can't beat me at my own game, rufus.  i haven't caused a nachovalanche since '97.  frankly, i find the whole "dating" thing to be overrated.  who would subject themselves to that.  those of us who can actually get dates.  if the bell to latin had rung like five milliseconds later.  latin.  so, that's where you've been slinking off to after chemistry.  caveat emptor.  he was going to ask me.  i could see it in his eyes.   the winner.  so he takes you to dinner.  you two see a movie.  big tapdancing whoop.  we do that stuff together all the time.  this is different, ron.  we'r i want it to be perfect.  have you ever noticed that "manke" is but one vowel away from "monkey".  i'm not implying anything.  it's just something to think about that's all.  manke... monkey. hmm...  and i'll say no more.  this serum is derived from pollen of the rare amazonian aurora orchid.  when it makes contact with the skin, it concentrates the human blushing mechanism.  anytime my teen foe feels embarrassment or humiliation, the serum will cause a desire to disappear to come true.  she will literally vanish question 32.  "you feel prettiest in...  a.) pink, b.) purple..." definitely green.  you have to admit, they sound a lot alike.  a lot, a lot alike.  ron, will you let the mankemonkey conspiracy die already.  i'm begging you.  hey.  did you see that.  see what.  i don't know.  nothing i guess.   so, what now.  haven't you been reading, shego.  the mall is an ideal venue for teenage embarrassment.  we just sit back and watch the show.   kim: it's josh.  wait, i should bail.  no, he's probably seen me by now.  i should just act natural.  no. ii'll take the escalator and then make my entrance from the health food store, so he'll think...  whoa.  hey.  kim.  smooth entrance, kim.  very subtle.  josh, ii'm so sorry.  i tripped and i was trying to...   kim.  i knew destroying kim possible would be a hoot, but this is simply delish.   hmm.    ron: hey, kim, wait up.  are you okay.  that was nasty.  ron, something critical is happening to me.  look at this.  yeah, i'm no doctor, but you might want to get that checked out.  wade: now just hold very still.  okay, rufus.  and scan complete.  compiling data now.  you said this started right after lunch, right.  check out this feed from bueno nacho's security camera.  drakken.  got it. according to bodytemperature readings, drakken's rigged it so that every time you blush, cue the disappearing act.  what does it mean.  i'm turning invisible.  well, that doesn't sound so bad.  it's kind of cool, actually.  sorry, guys, but it's more serious than that.  if the transformation becomes complete, kim will be gone.  gone. gone like how.  gone like goneas in forever.  kim, you can embarrass yourself right out of existence.  the good news is, i've isolated the causethe pollen of the aurora orchid flower.  it's only found in the remote regions of the amazon jungle.  another dose of pollen should negate the effect.  quest time. come on, rufus.  let's go. no way.  what if you barf on the plane or get gum you have to stay right here and avoid embarrassment at any cost.  oh, come on.  if i can do anything, i can keep myself from getting embarrassed.  lly mind over matter.  sorry, too risky, kp.  i mean, if it were me.  you what.  if i got hit by drakken, it wouldn't matter.  how so. oh, i don't get embarrassed.  ever. not that i can remember.  but what about the time you lost your pants.  times.too many to count, my friend.  and did i blush.  i did not.  hate to admit it, but he's right.  you're grounded.    kim: okay, blinds closed.  doors locked. computer off.  no embarrassment.  no embarrassment.  oh, wait.  the phone.   hello.  kim, it's josh.  josh, look i'mi'm so sorry about your shirt.  kim, i just wanted to see if you're okay.  i'm fine... for the most part.  listen, i... know this is kind of... last second, but... do you want to hang out tonight. i don't know...  yes. i mean no.  i mean yes.  i want to, but, uh, yes.  yes, yes.  i'm sorry, is that your way of saying yes or no.  the answer is definitely yes.  just give me a couple of minutes to get changed, okay.  hold up once you get to the dock.  i'll be right there to meet you.  to meet us. you. really.  i figured you could use some backup.  besides, it's time i got some experience in the field.  ron, rufus.  wade, i must say it's a pleasure to finally meet you in the flesh.  meet the wadebot xr prototype.  okay, not flesh per se.  let's roll.   how are we doing on time.  as long as kim stays in her room, we should be cool.   we'll get it. we'll get it.  don't even think about it, tweebs.  hi, kim. hey, josh.  you ready.   let's ride.  bye, mom. bye, dad.  i'll be home by 10:00.  just in case.  okay, so if she gets home by 10:00, she'll be on her computer doing the diary spill by about...  10:01.  so we hack into the diary by 10:02.  no good. why no good.  she'll be up all night writing gushy stuff about jo.  oh, right. the earliest we can get the dirt will be tomorrow morning.  unless...  we spy.  hoosha.  i hope you're hungry.  sorry. it's a little chilly in here. brrr.  table for two, please.   we need to make it another six or seven miles downriver.  it should...  rapids.  rapids. they're not on the map.  no.

salty, and cold and sweet.  is josh doing what i think he's doing.  dipping his fry into his shake.  what does kim see in this freak.  try it.  a french fry dipped in a milkshake.  josh manke, culinary trailblazer.  huh, he's kind of cute. i approve.  what are you, her sister all of a sudden.  we're trying to vanish kim possible from the face of the earth. remember.  one heaping helping of embarrassment.  coming right up.    okay, okay. okay, now it's your turn.  what is your most deep, dark, disgusting food combo.  no way. not until i know you way better.  ..  oops. excuse me, josh.

oh, wade, we're freefalling off a cliff.  this is no time for "oops." my bad. i never got around to actually installing the chute.  it's sitting here in my closet.  no.  oh.   ya.   hey, um... i'm
