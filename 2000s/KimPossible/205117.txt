and getting excited.  it makes us excited.  and that's what gets us pumped up.   is this a singoff. is this a singoff.  before going onstage, you can be really excited, but when you're onstage and you can see the fans singing the words andthat's the best feeling in the world is just to know that people love your music that much that they memorize all the words to your song.   . just a pebble in the

them.  that's the downside of dealing with criminalsthey're always looking to steal your stuff.  which reminds me, has anybody seen my stapler.  i do have an update on project titan.  the mutation formula will only work if the subject has first been exposed to extreme amounts of saturated fat, cholesterol, and preservatives.  you'd have to eat nothing but cow & chow or bueno nacho.  and even if you could find someone who eats that badly, ltimate superhenchman, we would get this.  oh. i would not wish that on my worst enemy.   what. you eat funny.  i know that. you think i don't know that.  ron, we have to talk.  talk to this kid. what's your name.  josh. well, then mind your own beeswax, josh.  ron.  he's getting all in my grill about how i eat.  hey, i'm just saying, it wouldn't hurt

like to get serious about an important subject.  who is hetalking to. i don't know.  shortterm genetic mutation.  sure, it's funny when ithappens to somebody else, but it isn't alwaysreversible.  ..  who's he talking to.  stay out of large vats ofmysterious chemicals.  keep your dna intactand stay unmutated.  you'll be glad you did.  what.  barkin:..  captioning made possible bydisney abc cable networks group captioning performed bythe national captioning institute, inc.  . todd and riley were, oh, so sad . then they came 'cross a fleemco ad . they sent away $1.98 . got a superspy mom and a daredevil dude of a dad . replacements . the replacements . now anytime they come across adults . who are sly and deny and defy them . and make things bad  hello, fleemco.  sir, we need a replacement.  and fast.  . and anytime they wanna make a change . modify and rearrange, though it might get kinda strange . make 'em better, nicer, stronger . faster, smart and cool or maybe even lame . call in the replacements . replacements . get the replacements . expect the replacements . replacements . get the replacements .  i forget, why did we join nature tweens in the first place.  oh, i don't know.  could it have something to do with your exboyfriend johnny hitswell being the president of our chapter.  whatever.  i'm so over him.  right.  have you even had a date since you two broke up.  actually, i had a dinner date just last night.  mmm...  sort of. kinda.  ok, not really, but it's purely coincidence that johnny and i are in the same club.  puhlease.  i bet you can't wait to get all up in his grill at the nature tweens award dinner this weekend.  let's just say that johnny and i both show up at the dinner alone, but the matre d' has just been replaced by a friend of the family who seats us at the same table, and johnny and i hit it off again and we get back together.  i'd be cool with that.  that's a fascinating and pathetic plan.  and in some ways, i wish i had thought of it first.  just one small problem johnny isn't going alone.  he's bringing... a date.   oh, yeah.  she's over johnny.  totally.   look out, the driveway.  whoa.  dad, what's happening.  your sister's selfless, agendafree dedication to the environment has inspired me to get rid of all this gasguzzling stud stuff.  the darings are going solar.  check this out.  my environmentally friendly solarpowered jet pack.  so you're just gonna leave this pile of junk sitting here.  ah, someone will pick it up.  i am now rea to soar through the sky like a maneagle.  wahooey.  oh... wh why does this keep happening..  what about... him.   mr. unibrow.  no, thank you.  i'm not that desperate.  yes, you are. if johnny has a date, you need one, too.  riley, you can't be so picky.  one brow, two brow, no brow take what you can get.  but i dated johnny hitswell.  that was pure luck.  you don't win the lottery twice.  you have a point.  but we have to find her a date... fast.  speed dating.  how'd you know about this.  uh, i read about it somewhere.  hey, tasumi. would you like me to punch your frequent dater card, huh.  you must have me confused with another tasumi.   go get 'em, riley.  so, what do you like to do in your free time.  i like to pet rabbits.  . i like musical theater . pick me. .  i like to eat fine cheeses and appreciate beautiful things.   jacobo.  ugh.  did you take a bath in your dad's cologne.  s.  ahem. my favorite movie isastronaut rabbits.  . figaro, figaro, figaro .  oh, let's forget about movies, k.  oh... do you mind if i call you k.  iit's short for riley.  . my favorite movie isthe mermaid king.   ugh. this is worthless.  so, what do you like to do for fun.  lately i've been getting into environmental stuff.  i was thinking of joining that group nature tweens.  so i enjoy long walks on a cleanedup beach...   good looking like johnny.  1.2 inches taller than johnny.  he loves the environment just like johnny.  he'll do.  i'll do what.  nothing.  wanna be my date for the nature tweens awards.  i thought you'd never ask.  my name's barry, by the way.  oh, yeah, whatever.  what, oh, what am i ever gonna do with these thingies.  it's only a few solar cells.  it's not like you bought a case of them, right.  right. i bought 50 cases.  uh, all right.  well, don't give up on solar yet, dad.  maybe it's not cut out for stunting, but i know if we keep thinking and keep looking and keep waiting, the perfect use for solar powerwillcome to us.  hey, loser.  hahaha. we just got back from two weeks of soaking up rays on the island of funruba.  totally paid for when we switched our house to solar. huh.  see you later, pale losers.  sun fury.  i got it.  the perfect use for solar power.  uh, what is it.  a solarpowered suntan booth.  only a genius like me could unlock the power of the sun to get a tan.  awesome. we'll be rich.  oh. oh. let's take this thing to riley's nature tween awards thingy.  those granolacrunching nature tweens will all want to buy one.  but it's an awards show.  they don't sell stuff at awards shows.  exactly. we'll be the only ones.  we'll have a total monopoly on the solarpowered suntan booth industry.  i knew you'd never let me down, solar power.  no. there they are again.  can't you clouds get on some sort of schedule..  cool dress, riley.  thanks.   get yourself a solarpowered sun bed.  harness the power of the sun to get your tan.  that doesn't make any sense.  yeah, i know.  but maybe you should try to explain it to them while i, uh, look around.  yeah, sure.  uh, guys, you know, this invention makes no sense.  no, what doesn't make sense is why you hate the environment.  yeah, environmenthater.  who sent you.  big oil.  and by that i mean big suntan oil.   i like good.  much better than whoever johnny brought to this thing.  excuse me.  what.  what.  johnny..  you're not my reflection. you're on the one hand, i don't trust you. )
