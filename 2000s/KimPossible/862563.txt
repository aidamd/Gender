tempus simia idol.  yeah, bad news on the headlessmonkey front, sir.  headless monkey. man, what did i miss.  the tempus simia idol, purported to have dark, mystical powers.  centuries ago, the head was taken to a far corner of the globe and hidden away forever.  must have been one ugly monkey.  many believe that if the tempus simia were ever made whole, it could be used for unspeakable...  monkey shines.  evil.  evil, naturally.  and monkey fist has it.  and drakken and killagan.  no way.  the villains teamed up, and i missed the whole deal.  so much for the bright future.  so not the drama, ron.  we can make this work.  i'll see what i can dig up on this tempus simia thing, and you'll, well, um...  be in norway.   kim: okay, quiz time.  drakken, monkey fist, and duff killagan are working together to...  it's a ruletheworld thing. got to be.  so, what's the power of the monkey.  easyeverybody fears monkeys.  no, that's just you, ron.  i'll stick to my theory.  okay, they've got to be looking for the head, right.  wade, can you hack into the global justice spy satellites.  in my sleep.  then, take a nap and scan for drakken.  on it.  so, ron, how's it going. i'm kind of worried about you.  worry not, k.p. ron stoppable can adapt.  yeah.  what's that you're eating.  lamb and cabbage stew.  mmmm, yum.  lamb and cabbage stew.  yep, norway's second most popular dish.  right behind meatcakes.  right.  everybody loves meatcakes.  oh, yeah, i've got the mad love for the meatcakes.  sounds like you're adjusting.  oh,ja.  that's norwegian... or french.  great. okay, i got to runlatin class.  i... oh, sorry.  i know how much you wanted to take that.  latin shmatin. i've got lamb and cabbage.  i need bueno nacho.  more meatcakes, honey.  no. no meatcakes. no meatcakes.  nothing's happening.  why is nothing happening.  something should be happening.  shouldn't it. patience.  when the idol is near its head, the tempus simia will clap.  there's no such thing as mystical monkey power.  you wouldn't know mystical monkey power if you held it in your tiny little hands.  aye, they are wee small digits.  uh, guys.  i'll let my "wee" fingers do the talking, mr. skirty pants.  guys...  can you two buffoons take this outside.  at 30,000 feet.  precisely.  guys..  what.. what.. what..  the monkey clapped.   we're getting close.  monkey power rules.   you, me, and bueno nacho.  and we're going to grande size it, girl.    so, ron enough for you.  thanks, monique, but there's no substitute.   what's the sitch, wade.  i tracked down team drakken. where to.  deep in the australian outback.  better tell ron. what time is it there.   bedtime apparently.  you know, as cold as norway is, it's even colder at 2:00 a.m.   it's summer in australia.  i'm there, kim.  next stopaustria.  no, no, australia.  right, save me some strudel.  he'll never make it.   maybe i need a plan b.  me. i'm plan b.  kim, i don't think i can.  you're puppydog pouting now, aren't you.  no. not at all.  uh. you got me.  booya.  right, sheilas, you're on your own from here.  that's cool.  wade set us up.  hey, mine is...   maybe a little less ronish.  uh... okay.    warmer, warmer.   ooh, colder.   warmer. warmer.  hah. i'm white hot.  the head must be under here.  all right, on threeone, two, three.   i cannot do it alone.  hmm.  ah, there.  a mystical monkey doorknob.  hoist me up, killagan.  i'll turn it.  with those wee, barely hands.  hah. dream on, blue boy.  mutant showoff.  why do you get to go first.  why do you.  waffle away, gents.  i'll be getting ahead.  kim: excellent formation boys.   your landing needs a little work.  kim possible.  why do you always act so surprised.  hmm. i don't know.  whoa.  watch out.  who's she.  where's the buffoon.  um, i'm monique.  ii'm really just filling in.  nice to "beat" you.  my face needs space.  uh, maybe i should handle shego.  i'll play through then.  fore.  you hit golf balls.  that's your big villain shtick.  my dad does that.  golf balls that explode.  welcome to my world.  yeah, can we focus here, kimmie.  i think i need to train some more, like... like 20 years more.     uh, kim, her hands are glowing.  yeah, avoid those.   oh, par for the course, lassie.   boo.   monkey fist: triumph.   okay, i liked the land surfing part, but the fighting the freaks part.  yeah, i could live without.  .  i made it.  huh.  uhoh.  did we miss them again.  yeah. but this time....  bad guystwo, good guyszero.  guten tagy,burgit.  today i'd like to order off the menu.  are you familiar with the nacho.  lamb and cabbage stew. next.  yuck.   saved by the bell.  what's the sitch.  : that felt kind of cool.  wade turned up some dirt on the tempus simia idol.  great. so, what's it do.  it's still a mystery.  but we do know there's a temple of the tempus simia in central africa.  you think we'll find evil incorporated there.  that's where they have to put the head on the monkey.  this ancient magic stuff, it's always so complicated.  i'm sure the mystic monkey monks had their reasons.  uh, excuse me, private talky, do you mind.  rude enough.  i am so over blondes, kim.  no novelty value whatsoever here.  okay.  meet me in africa.  this time, i swear i won't be late.  go.  iamflooring it.   giddyap already.  oh, come on, you're slower than the camel.   ow.  ron.  sorry i'm late.  this elephant totally copped a 'tude with me.  ron, it's cool. you're right on time.  wow.  the tempus simia temple is just over that ridge.  one, two, three.  ha. rock beats paper.  are you daft, man.  paper beats rock, everyone knows that.  oh, come now, that doesn't even make sense.  how can flimsy paper possibly beat the raw density of stone.  it is time.  our moment is at hand.  finally.  pardon me for making you wait a few minutes to dominate the world.  but the magic won't work unless the head is reattached precisely at noon.  why is this ancient magic stuff always so complicated.  toss me the monkey noggin.  what. no.  using mystical monkey power was my idea.  the honor should be mine.  no, mine.  i am stuck with the freak stooges.  hey, guys, why don't you work as a team and put the stupid head on together.  but i hate sharing.  no sharing.  then, we shall not share, together.  yes.   less than a minute now.  kim: sorry, can't wait that long.  i've got a latin test, and, wow, i'd hate to miss that.  you don't stand a chance, possible.  it's three against one.  excuse me.  okay, two against four if you count the sidekicks.  honestly, why do i bother.  . get up on your

on your feet now .  . feet now... feet now... .  so long, kim possible.  we'll meet again,in time.    we... lost.  we seem to be doing that a lot lately.  ron: sorry, kim.  i thought you were going to zig when you zagged.  zig. i always zag in that sitch.  really. oh, man, we are so out of sync.  yeah, no doubt.  well, i guess that's what happens when you live on opposite sides of the globe.   it's not working, is it, the savetheworld thing.  i don't think so, k.p.  you, um, you'd better go it alone.   yeah, i guess i'd better.  still friends.  always. i've got, um...  i've got something in my eye, kim.  i'm going to talk to you later.   "tempus:time."  "simia:monkey." tempus... simia...  drakken: we'll meet again... in time.  time monkey.   rufus.  i am rufus 3000.  i have come for you from the future.  this just got so much weirder.  pickabicaboo.  huh. pic... abic... aboo.  waderufus just zapped into my bedroom and he's talking like the tweebs.  kim, rufus is in norway with ron.  did you say rufus is talking.  yeah. check this out.  uh, kim...  i don't think that's rufus.  he's totally rufus.  eexcept for the, you know, talking part.  i am known as rufus 3000.  i come from the future.  okay.  you're from the year 3000.  no, but iamone of 3,000 hyperevolved descendants of rufus prime.  wade, give me the supergenius take on this.  i'm definitely picking up time cooties.  really.  no.  there's no such thing as time cooties.  actually, there are, and they really itch, but we must focus on a more important issue. hmm.  the fate of the world.  hmm. could you be more specific.  it will be clearer if i show you.   step forward.  no way.  drakken did it.  hehe took over the world.  how does that happen.  the supreme one took power with cruel swiftness.  no one knows exactly what happened.  we believe that time travel is the key.  somehow the supreme one tampered with your past.  time travel...  the time monkey.  exactly.tempus simia.  but what can i do.  history tells us that you were the only one to have defeated the supreme one in the pretempus simiaera.  but if the supreme one has the time monkey in the future... or the past or...  wow.  ah... brain pain.  time travel does that.  all i know is, i'm stuck in the now and i'm fresh out of time monkey.  this is a chronomanipulator.  big enough.  beats strapping a monkey to your wrist. true.  this is your ticket to time travel.  use it in victory.  cool.  mind if i scan the specs.  no, the timestream has been polluted enough.  in fact, i must return to my own time before i corrupt the past even further.  also, i'm making cookies.  cookies.  fighting an evil overlord works up a fierce appetite.  i hear that.  kim possible...  the fate of the future, humanity and the planet earth itself rests in your hands.  but no pressure.  pusha.  shego: guys, guys, guys, guys, guys.  okay, yeah, we got a time monkey.  whoohoo. yay for usbut we need a plan.  a smart plan.  sidekicks are to be seen and not heard, shego.  we need a plan...  a smart plan.  we're listening.  i have run a computer analysis of kim possible's life and have calculated the exact day when she will be most vulnerable.  sounds smart.  we must go undercover.  using this juvenator.  juvenator.  whwhat's a juvenator.  cool.  okay, just got dumb.  i'm a wee laddie.  drakken, why on earth are we toddlers.  because our target is kim possible's first day of preschool.   ooh, i felt my baby sister kick.  now, kim, remember, it might be a baby brother.  it might be two.  don't even joke.  mommy, i want to stay with you and daddy and my baby sister.  now, kimmie cub, if you did that, you'd miss out on your first day of preschool.  maybe i don't want to go.  kimmie, we know your first day might seem a little scary.  but, as soon as you make a friend, you'll see what a super time you're in for.  what if i can't make a friend.  kimmie cub, there's something you must never forget.  always say "please" and "thank you".  yes, that, but i also want you to remember that anything is possible for a possible.  okay.  that's my girl.  remember when i became the middleton mad dog.  oh, yeah...  all the other cheerleaders thought it was stupid, but kim, my friend kim...  well, actually, she thought it was stupid, too.   but, but kim came around eventually... i think.  perhaps the greatest day of my life, the bueno nacho grand opening.  kim gave me a ride.  huh. i didn't know how to ride a twowheeler yet, and you can't take your trike to a restaurant opening.  it's just not done.  oh, yeah.  ah, prek. that's where k.p. and i first met, right after nap time.  huh. there i am.  there's kim.  what the heck.  okay, say "cheese." kids: cheese.  cut it out.  what do we have here.  three bad little boys.  youarea boy, right.  aye.   where are your shoes.  i, oh, uh... lost them.  i'd check around the monkey barn.   that was a most productive morning.  indeed. pigtailpulling, dollystealing.   does somebody here need a timeout.  oh, no, teacher.  we'll be little angels...  until we hit the playground.  then we will crush kim possible's spirit.    how long can it take to crush the spirit of a fouryearold.  this is low, even for you, shego.  no, not my idea.  i'd go lower.  you like time travel.  allow me to knock you into the next century.   allow me to make you history.   huh. hey.  give it. it was my turn.  oh, it was your turn.  we had no idea. here.  thanks.  psych.  leave her alone.  it's her turn.  taking turns is the basic foundation of preschool.  the jungle law of daycare is behind us.  we have structure. we have rules.  get him.   i'm warning you.  i have an imaginary friend.  he's huge.  rufus.  hey, bullies.  hyah.   shego, help.  the wee lass is a savage.   oh, no. she's here.  the little brat.  the big brat.  hey, guess what.  free swim in the timestream is over.  mission not accomplished, i presume.  i had a lovely nap.  we're regrouping.  fear not, gentlemen.  time is on our side.  drop it.  ow.  kim possible, have you stopped the supreme one.  not.  and they escaped with the time monkey.  well, have a cookie.  they're peanut butter.  thanks.  i will return to the future and scan the time stream.  we must determine where the supreme one will strike next.  can i drop you off in the early 21st century.  no, thanks.  i'll just wait here in the good old days.  did that one kid of opposable toes.  you're weird, but i like you.  where are we, drakken.   it reeks of middleton.  indeedthe middleton of the nottoodistant past.  to be precise, the day kimpossible.com went online.  aye, but before the bubble burst.  it's so cool that we both got new computers.  yours is new. i got stuck with my dad's old one.  ooh, sorry.  hey, can you get online.  uhhuh, i'm researching hairless pets.  your dad's allergies, huh.  my parents finally said i could get a pet, but no fur.  and you'd be surprised how many mammals have fur.  i'm making my own web site.  what for.  ah, babysitting jobs and stuff.  you know, helping people out.  how 'bout a hairless cat.  way too freaky.  okay, type in kimpossible.com.  loading, loading...  "kim possible, she can do anything." yeah, you know, it sounds a little braggy.  it's like a commercial, ron.  it's supposed to be braggy.  she just set up her web site.  so what is your plan, drakken.  do enlighten us.  when young kim possible goes on her first mission, we'll make sure she fails.  this time, her spirit will be crushed.  oh, we tried crushing her spirit.  can we nay simply crush her.  i'm with the mad golfer on this one.  no, no, listen.  we'll infiltrate her life as fellow preteens.  lame.  shego.  have you forgotten the talk we had about hurting with our words.  listen, you're better off with their approach.  if you can figure out a way to crush kimmie, her spirit won't really be an issue.  the legends of a longgone mystical sect speak of a being that would be exactly what we need.  if you need me, i'll be in the third century saxama province.  is this another monkey temple.  not at all.  gorilla.  so what was the lassie's first mission.  something about an eccentric billionaire collector.  mr. paisley, i assure you.  this security system is the best money can buy.  no thief could survive the laser web.  so my flamingoat will be safe.  yes, mr. paisley.  your extensive and vaguely disturbing collection of plush is 100% secure.  because the flamingoat is the rarest...  both: of the cuddle buddies.  only ten were made.  ooh, ooh, how does it work.  do i press the red button.  no. not the red button.   the laser web is lethal.  don't move a muscle.  don't even flinch.    uh, mr. mchenry.  how do we turn it off.  we would need the remote for that.  don't panic. let me think.  i've got it.  team impossible.  who.  team impossible.  supersecret commando squad.  this is what they train for.   just have to access their web site.   tryouts.  hate them.  who's next.  kim possible.  tin teeth.  i gave her a routine no girl can do.     fine, you make the squad. barely.  yes.  kim. you got a hit on the site.  a major hit.   babysitting the turner twins again.  no, danger major.  danger.  somebody needs your help, like, now.  kim, you're just starting practice.  oh, i know, i'm sorry.  i'll never ever ditch again.  i swear.  kim: thanks, mrs. mahoney, for driving us all the way to upperton.  it's the least i could do since you rescued tabby from that tree.  no big. see you.  you're sure this is the right address, ron.  yup, someone's trapped in there.  mm, i don't know.  this seems like the kind of stuff the police should handle.  truth in advertising, kim.  your web site says you can do anything.  now it sounds braggy.  okay, first step: getting inside.  hey, i've got a little something that might help.  what is... that.  a naked mole rat.  i just got him yesterday at smartymart.  a naked mole rat.   i named him rufus.  it's cute, huh.  where is monkey fist.  oh, i'm working with a man named monkey fist.  my evil career is so in the toilet.  say, rufus, buddy, you think maybe you could open these gates for us.  uhhuh.  naked mole rat, pets of the future.  tada.  a naked mole rat.  gross, but handy.  want to hold him.  mm, i'll pass.  ron: what are those red things.  lasers.  yes, we would like to have those shut off, please.  paisley, you can relax.  team impossible can handle this.  uh, yes, that's us.  good name. we could use that.  just tell me what i need to do.  get that remote, but avoid the beams at all costs.  um... okay.   . it's just you .  . doing the impossible .  . it's you .  . you're practically unstoppable .  . it's you .  . totally on untoppable .  . it's you, it's you, it's you .  . you're kim possible. .  booyah, kim.  a cheerleader.  that'd be kim possible.  she can do anything.  look us up online. we're worldwide, baby.  it's over. hairy hands blew it.  he has the power of time travel and he's late.  calm yourself, killagan.  i have returned, and i've brought a little piece of the past with me.  is that a flamingoat.  but that's the rarest cuddle buddy.  they only made ten. ten.  this so blows my pandaroo out of the water.  i never thought i'd even see one of these.  now my life is complete.  perfect.  so you won't mind if we end it.  giant monkey.   that is sick and wrong.  mr. paisley, i suggest we hide.  kim possible, meet...  the stone guardian of saxama.  or should i say, meet your doom.    giant monkey.  what did i ever do to you.  nothing yet, but you will.  yes, in time you shall hand each of us humiliating defeats.  aye, and it's a deep hurt.  buckle up, boys.  the hurt is on.  kim possible.  times two.  ah. giant monkey.   anybody want to explain any of this to me.  i'm you from the future.  okay, this is a 9.7 on the weirdness scale.  oh, you'll get used to it, trust me.  look out.  well, monkey fist, i must admit i had my doubts.  aye, me, too.  this actually seems to be working.   listen closely.  i can't believe it.  i told drakken a thousand times, "no clones." i am not a clone.  you're not.  i'm you from the future.  oh, i hate time travel.   am i the only one who sees the giant monkey..  listen, we don't have a lot of time.  okay, actually, we do. well, we will.  when you want to make sense, just let me know.  grab the time monkey.  why.  you need the time monkey.  can't i just use yours.  no, this is mine.  okay, actually, it's yours, too.  i mean, it's the one you're going to steal, so technically...  if you need me, i'll be in there watching kim possible lose.  trust me, this whole rock gorilla deal is going to go south, so when it does, make sure you get that time monkey.  run through this again for me.  kim possible cannot win this battle.  wrong, ape man.  help has arrived.  what is going on.  kim possible needs you.  oh, please. the buffoon.  oh, what possible help could the side kick be.  ron, what... are you wearing.  my mom signed me up for a fold dancing class.  that's the future you.  what's with this stupid hat.  it's, uh, it's a future hat.   dude, personal space.  future me isn't afraid of monkeys.  i get brave.  you have to be to dress like that.    ooh, what's this.  i wonder what the red button does.  both: no.   wow.  cool.  booyah. you rock.  no, my young friendyou rock.  nice to know the braces work.  yeah, as long as you don't try to kiss walter nelson.  locked braces.  it was an embarrassing ride to the orthodontist.  so what does the future hat do.  nothing. it's just a hat.  okay, look, listen to me.  in the future you will change your hair and become a babe magnet.  keep that look.  okay, but what about that hat.  forget the hat.  officers, take them away.  but you can't leave us here in the past.  aye, we'll face years of dj vu.  this will throw the timestream into chaos.  yeah, like i haven't heard that one before.  hmm, going to prison sure sounds like a waste of time.  of course, with this, i can waste all the time i want.  the time monkey.  later, losers.  kim possible.  the supreme one has once again escaped into the time stream.  no, shego did.  the supreme one is right here.  where. i don't see her.  her. i thought the supreme one was drakken.  certainly not. behold the face of evil.  the face of the supreme one.  shego.  oops.  shego is the supreme one.  well, you could have mentioned that.  i thought it was obvious.  uhhuh, sure.  but just run it down for kim's sake.  wasn't it clear that shego was the only one smart enough to take over the world.  well, i guess it always seemed more like a guy thing.  so, shego has the time monkey and she's all powerful, 20 years from now.  so, short term, everything is hakuna, right.  not necessarily.  the time stream is in flux.  i'm tired of playing defense, i'm taking the fight to shego.  you're going to the future.  yeah.  okay, okay, from here on out, we're in this together, k.p.  for the danger to the time stream, it's impossible.  impossible.  check my name.  she's got you there, buddy.   very well, proceed.  hey, look, i've got one foot in the future.  let's warp, or whatever you call it.  confused. oh, yeah.  good, i thought it might just be me.  so, this is middleton of the future.  actually, it's now called shegoton.  dark, but with style.  yeah, bleak chic. quickly, the eyes of the supreme one are everywhere.  you there, why aren't you toiling for the glory of the supreme one.  told you. oh, dude, i am so toiled out.  we've got a lippy norwegian and some gerbilscode five.  hey. naked mole rats, please.  send security drones, tag and bag.  i'll hold them off as long as i can.  ah. my future hat.  be honest, does the costume work without the hat.  ron, it didn't work with the hat.  "club shego".  ugh, more like club ego.  oh, well, when in shegoton, blend in.  kim, you put the "neato" in "incognito." okay, which is the guy's side.  this is a fashion nightmare.  at least it's not a bad fit.  really. 'cause mine's kind of riding up.  i think i picked from the girl's side.   okay, k.p., what's our next step.  we find shego.  somebody loves herself a little too much.  i don't know, guys, you got to give shego her props.  i mean, this is one slick citadel of doom.  motion detectors, laser cannons and my favorite touch, a piranhafilled moat.  a moat. so retro.  yeah, but you know, i'm a sucker for the classics.  ow.   no.  it can't be.   in her mad quest for power, she destroyed bueno nacho.  you'll pay for this, lady.  oh, yes, you will pay.  ron, maybe now is not the time.  um, excuse me, scary orb thing, where are you taking us.  the attitude adjustment center.  isn't that the high school.  prepare to be drained of all individuality and spirit.  yep, high school.  welcome to the attitude adjustment center.  that's right, file in, fill all the seats.  i see some openings in the front row.  hi, i'm bonnie rockwaller.  bonnie. she's working for shego.  that fits.  psst, kim, i think that's brick flag.  wow, it is.  man, he let himself go.  shh.  okay, let's start.  does anyone know why you're here.  yes, you, soulless worker drone number 5889.  well, uh, i think...    exactly.  you're here because you think.  and we all know that's not allowed.  the supreme one thinks for you.  let's watch an instructional video.  lights.   the supreme one started with a simple dream, to rule the world.  of course, it was my dream first.  ah.  hey, eyes on me. you know, i started out as an underestimated sidekick, trying to make the stupid schemes of others succeed.  my schemes were not stupid.  ah. the burning.  ooh, but with the help of a timetraveling monkey idol, i went solo with an evil scheme of my own, and it worked.  so, now it's my world.  you're just living in it.  back to work.  not the feelgood film of the year.  that's true, the music was good.  so...  who still questions the infallible leadership of the supreme one.  wait, don't answer.  we'll just mind scan them.   it tickles.  our scan has picked up two troublemakers in the back row.  i wonder what they do with troublemakers.  hey. heyhey.  high school never had to resort to this sort of thing.  or that sort of thing.  obedience collars, you'll learn to love them.  not that you'll have a choice.  i'll pass.  i'm not big on the blingbling.  ron, i don't think it's optional.  what.  eat hot plasma, supreme one stooges.  viva la resistance.  hey, norwegian.  naked mole rats, attack.    get them off of me.  they're so gross.  love your timing.  wow, those dudes are buff.  what's the dealy on them.  i do not recognize them.  hickabickaboo. hoosha.  the tweebs.  welcome to the future, big sis.  more like little sis.  little brothers are now big brothers.  time travelit's a cornucopia of disturbing concepts.  wait, i have some questions about this.  no time now. we've got to jet.  in the kiminatormark 12.  wow.  hurry, the supreme one will soon return with greater force.  strap in.  'cause the kiminator flies, baby.  kiminator.  kiminatormark 12.  we kept fighting about the name.  so, we named it after you.  you guys are so sweet.  mature work's on you.  wait, what about mom and dad.  up there. on the moon.  hoosha.  mom and dad led the great lunar migration after the supreme one turned earth into such a drag.  hon, i'm home.  how was the sea of tranquillity.  traffic was terrible.  didn't they even miss me.  oh, yeah, but dad always said...  well, at least kimmie's just lost in the time stream and not staying out late with some boy.  what about my parents.  i'm an actuary, i can work anywhere.  okay, so where are we going now.  our secret headquarters. it's in a remote location where no one ever goes.  operton.  now it's called north shegoton, but, yeah, that's the place.  there, you'll meet our leader.  kim, ron, man, am i glad to see you guys.  wade.  we finally get to see you in person.  and you're a giant.  what can i say, i had a growth spurt.  why is everybody in the future so ripped.  fighting an evil dictator will do that to you.  fine, but just don't think i'm a puny man, 'kay.  : i got mad fu skills.  ron, don't do that. you crack me up. man.  : ow.  so, wade, what's the sitch.  it's been a long time since i heard that.  the tempest simian idol.  shega used it to play the time stream.  we need it to set everything right.  take that away, shego's future is history.  can't we just break it.  the chaotic effect of unleashing the chronol energies, might snap the time stream back to normal.  might. might.  or, it might unravel the fabric of time and space and destroy the universe.  even mom and dad on the moon.  okay, let's just start with getting it away from shego.  we tried to get in, but every mission ended badly.  then we're due.  : same old kim.  anybody seen rufus.  rufus prime, please...  share your wisdom. huh.  what is the meaning of life.  hmm...  cheese.   you owe me a buck.  we've run the scenarios.  aerial assault equals major catastrophe.  and a ground assault, worse.  then we'll go lower.  ron: sewers.  oh, man...  there's a whole rainbow of smells down here.  ew.  wade, don't you have, likelike, a matter transporter or something.  couldn't you just beam us into shego's palace.  sure, but your insides might wind up on the outside.  it would be a great chance to meet your spleen.  how would i even know it'smyspleen.  so far so good.  oh, really.  tell that to my shoes.    according to my readings, the idol is in the center of the palace.  monkey fist, you're working for shego, too.  well, i don't get a paycheck, if that's what you mean.  but there are some benefits.  i'll consider this one of them.  you're way outnumbered, dude.  am i.  rufus prime, will you lead us.    you will never see a stranger sight.  move it or lose it, guys.   this way.  how close are we.  real close. just down this hall.  sorry, you'll not be getting by me, laddies.  duff.  hey, but now they call me robo duff.
