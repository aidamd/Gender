 s man.  ron,please just take us to the pay phone.  i am your only hope.  what.  ron. normal.  listen up, people.  camp wannaweep is a dangerous and wicked place, and among us only i, ron stoppable know how to survive here.  don't believe me.  see that.  poison oak.  how do i know.  what's this plant.   make the itching stop.  this is a place of evil.  stay close and you'll stay alive.   out of order.  i don't like this.  place of evil.  this is just like those movies.  innocent teens stranded at a camp in the middle of nowhere.  then, some creepo starts to pick them off.  one by one.  sonot the drama, tara.  this isn't a horror movie.  oh, isn't it.  okay, if it were a horror movie there'd be more guys.  and they'd be way cuter than him.  oh, bonnie.  you remind me of the cruel kids at camp.  sticks and stones.  oh, the called you names.  yes, while they were hitting me with sticks and stones.  i saw something move.  it's just a squirrel.  just a squirrel.  really.  leave me alone.   so you've always been a piece of work, huh, stoppable.  they were bigger then.  sure you weren't just smaller.  they were bigger.  well, looks like we're stuck for the night.  okay, let's make the best of it.  yes, right, follow me.  ron: i was trapped.  hiding in the hollow of a tree.  and then the woodpeckers came.  your freaky friend is acting extra freaky.  he's not freaky, bonnie.    well, okay, he kind of is but it's not his fault.  it's the curse of camp wannaweep.  what if he's right.  what if this place is cursed.  tara, please.  stoppable, you're working on my nerves.  mr. b., shh.  we've got a rustle in the brush.   ron, i think we've established that the squirrels mean us no harm.  what's that supposed to mean.  let's just enjoy the campfire and relax.    so, you shared a cabin with a tickinfested chimp.  yeah, that's right.  this place holds a lot of memories for me.  some bad, some...  no, no, no, all bad.   i, um, i'm going to go get some more firewood, yeah.  ooh, k.p.  camp wannaweep, rule number oneuse the buddy system.  oh, well, i think i can handle it.  he's right, possible.  i'll go, too.  mr. b.'s with the program.  i cannot take another camp story.  why do you think i'm going.    you know, ron i happen to think it's kind of nice here.  oh, really.  yeah.  sure.  i mean, the woods are, you know... woodsy.  and, and well, just look at the lake.  it seems so peaceful.  ah, yes, lake wannaweep.   eww.  oh, i hated that lake.   not another story.  no...  way.  i am not going into that water.  all right, everybody jump in the lake.   eww. eww. eww. eww.  what's wrong now, stoppable.  the lake.  have you looked at it.   have you smelled it.  boy: look at ronnie.  the squeeb's scared of the water.   i am not scared.  the water is green it stinks, and i'm pretty sure i've seen the fish glowing at night.  gil, weren't you in the morning swim group.  you're supposed to be in arts & crafts right now.  there's no way i'm getting out to make some stupid wallet.  you stay in there too long, you're going to wrinkle up like a prune.  yeah, right.  you know, i could take gil's spot in arts & crafts and he could have my afternoon swim.  i mean, you know, for the whole summer.  oh, fine, whatever.  just change the activity roster.  we're heading for jungle law that's all i know.  i still say you're a squeeb.  we'll see who's the squeeb at the end of the summer when you're all wrinkled up like a prune and i've got a suitcase full of handmade wallets, pot holders and lanyards.  that was the last time i ever saw gil.  so, you've been a loser for, like, ever.  hmm.     mr. barken, did you hear that.  stoppable's getting to you.  that's just nature's night music.   mr. barken.  mr. barken.  mr. barken.  have you seen barken.  kim, duh. barken's with you.  not anymore.  so, where is he.  ii don't know.  there were these weird sounds, he was there more weird sounds then he disappeared.  what..  uh, where are liz and marcela.  they went to the little girl's cabin.   k.p., buddy system.   kim, do i have to remind you the importance of the buddy system.  it didn't help liz and marcela.   that's not a human footprint, kim.  okay, i'm getting a little freaked out here.  there's only one place to gocabin 13.   in this very cabin i was able to survive every evil camp wannaweep could throw at me.    this will be our base of operations.  uh, ron.  yes, tara.  i'm hungry.  well, if we pry up the floorboard, like so, we'll find my secret stash of snacks.  cool.  tara, those are ancient.  gross.  pop pop porter's food style pork waffer's have enough preservatives to last for decades.  it's not so bad.  it's definitely foodstyle.  great. our squad is short two people and there is nobody to drive us to the competition.  dude, forget the competition.  how are we going to survive the night.  there's something out there.  okay, okay.  you're right.  do you think that something can drive.  everybody stay calm.  i'm going to handle this.  here's the plan...  uh...  excuse me.  what.  on the school bus, barken's in charge.  when we're saving the world, you're in charge.  but here at camp wannaweep, i'm in charge.  ron, this is serious.  hello, note serious face.  barken: possible.  mr. barken.  he's out there, let's go.  possible.  it's okay, mr. barken, we're here.  it's dripping and oozing muck.  mr. b., what exactly isit.  freakish, it's, it's...  makes me ill to visualize it.   oh, come on.  i'm sure i've faced worse.  did you say "oozing muck".   andit's back there.    that's the guy.  he is freakish.  i heard that, squeeb.  remember me.  not really.  and i got to tell you, i think i'd remember.  oh, come, ronnie, think.  we switched places.  you took my arts & crafts and i took your swim time.  gil.  gil...  gil who.  oh, i'm no longer gil.  now i am gill.  uh... what's the difference.  i added an "l." you know, as in "gill." as in, these things that grew when i mutated.   k.p..  step away from miss possible, ronnie.  how do you know her.  oh, i know all about your life, squeeb.  it's been going great, hasn't it.  ii've got some complaints, but who doesn't.  is one of your complaints that you're a stinking mutant.  all right, son, let's take a time out here before things get out of hand.  do you mind.  can't you see i'm catching up with my old camp buddy.  so, ron, did you ever hear why they shut down the camp.  uh, no.  it turns outoh, you're going to love thisthe lake had been polluted by runoff from the science camp.  i thought that was the band camp.  no, that's band camp.  really, i thought that was clown camp.  no, that's clown camp.  oh, yeah.  i love those clowns.  okay, the point is the lake was toxic.  see, i thought that lake was funky.  i'm glad i never went in.  you on the other hand, you practically...  lived in that water.  while you made wallets.  and lanyards.  i ruled at lanyards.  look, we know plenty of scientists.  maybe someone can cure you.  science.  science made me like this.  are you sure it wasn't the clowns.  aren't you wondering how i jammed all of your communications.  equipment stolen from telecommunications camp.  lucky guess.  so you were behind the blowout on the bus and everything. why.  all part of my plan to revenge against ron stoppable.  part of me is terrified and yet part of me is flattered.  did i mention that contact with this muck will turn you into a mutant.  just like me.  well, you left that part out.  this is sick and wrong.  ah, there is no way they are going to let a squad of mutant cheerleaders in the competition.  there is no competition.  don't you get it.  it was all a trap.  and guess what, ronnie.  you're next.  announcer:" the ultimate thrill ride through the world of disney.  ah, wintertime.  a great time to get out those old skates and get together with friends and family for a little goodnatured hockey.  but everyone has that one annoying uncle who thinks he's too cool for school.  too bad this guy's about to learn his lesson.  triple foul.  get it. fowl. never mind.  talk about a hat trick.  how's he keep that thing on.  duck, duck, duck, duck, blam.  ooh, brain freeze.  ..for life.  see, instead of wearing a scarf, maybe he should have worn some pants.  blam.  let's chill out and check out the blamcam.  a perfectlyexecuted 360 upsidedown tree grind.  that's gonna score big with theblam.  whoa. is this duck doing the funky chicken.  he banged his head, and now he's headbanging.  he's trying to wow the judges with a rarelyattempted triple super axel spin with a twist to ablam.  what a mess.  call in the blamboni.  is anyone else in the mood for deviled eggs right now.  remember, don't try this at home.
