 king) they forgot the pickles.  okay, dexter. i'll deal with it.  wowiewow. it's really him. it's dexter.  incoming.  roland, this is all your fault, yo.  there were pickles all over my plate.  ryan, maybe you had dexter's plate.  have you considered that.  i did not have dexter's plate.  you think i don't know my own plate.  roland.  do you want us to tell the record company that you're not taking care of us.  look what you've done.  what.  what.  this. look.  it says my zodiac sign is pisces.  well, you were born on march 16.  pisces, it's fish.  so.  i hate fish.   i' see what i can

nicky nick and...  who's that guy.  i told you to get lost.  oh.  all: roland.  man, you guys know how to rock.  what do you do for a finale.   and you are.  roland pond, defteen records.  can you tell me what happened.  it all happened so fast.  kim: i can help, officer hobble.  the criminals had a stateoftheart operation.  kim possible.  you've got nothing to worry about, sir.  really.  with kim possible on the case, your oh boyz will be back in no time.  that's right.  i'd help no matter what, but they got my best friend, too.  this iswaypersonal.  it is hopeless.  my dream will never come true.  junior, your dream will soon be a reality.  oh, look.  dexter, the smart one.  ryan, the youngest one.  robby the cute one.  nicky nick the funny one.  and...  uhoh.  i don't know this one, and yet he rings a bell in me.  what. he's not one of...  the new oh boy. the other one.  yes, i remember him now.  he's obviously carrying the others.  it looks like we have no choice but to cancel tomorrow's opening gig.  what's the dollar damage, benny.  well, not so damaging.  really. yeah. we were losing money on shows when nobody showed up.  the oh boyz showed up.  exactlyand we had to pay them, their bodyguards, their hair stylists, their aura cleansers.  oh, boy.  right. so we don't lose any money anymorethis is a good thing.  what's a good thing.  that we have you to help us.  have there been any demands.  not since the oh boyz were taken.  i meant from whoever captured them.  no, nothing yet, but i'll keep you on speed dial.  but i never gave you my digits.  okay. must've been some other teen who means well.  what was the number again.  if the record company wishes to have their precious oh boyz back, they will bow to my demand.  what is your demand, father.  that they make you an international pop sensation.   call them now. please, please, please.  as you wish, my boy.  we're in trouble.  nobody is going to give junior a record deal.  we have nothing to worry about.  roland will give these jokers anything to get us back.  a day without the oh boyz is like a day where i don't lose money.  no more whining pop rats.  life is sweet.   father: please listen closely if you want to see the oh boyz again.  look, sorry, i got to hop off.  call my office, we'll set a thing. bye now.  was i not clear in my demands.  what i don't get is why would anybody take them.  everyone knows that they're over except ron.  that'she weird part, kim. they were over.  say what.  the oh boyz are all over the news.  they haven't gotten this much attention since nicky nick broke up with britina.  let me stream you a video.  tv host: "the oh boyzwhen the pop stopped." the oh boyznot so long ago, they were the hottest band in the world, with such number one hits as "hello, hello, hello."  i'm going through a tunnel stuck in a canyon    in an elevatordo you even listen.    no, no, no, no no, no, no, no    ohoh    hello, hello, hello    can you hear me now.    or am i losing you    hello    got to reconnect somehow    'cause i can't hear you    hello, hello, hello   . hello.   and, of course, "i want it my way."  when you go get on the road    the answer is no, no, no    no, no, no, no    and when you say hit the highway    you know that i gotta stay    it's not that i love you, baby    i just want it my way    'cause i want it my way, i like it my way    it's my way or the highway    yes, i want it my way, i like it my way    it's my way or the highway    if that makes me selfish as you have accused    let me just say this: i don't like to lose    'cause i want it my way, i like it my way...   but lately the hits have turned to misses.  their concerts opened to empty arenas.  the fans had moved on.  it seems like only yesterday they were yesterday's news.  i mean, they were yesterday's news the day before yesterday.  no. wait. yeah, that's it.  when did they mysteriously vanish.  so theywereyesterday's news until yesterday.  okay, you know what. forget it.   since the oh boyz concert disappearance, something amazing has happened.  i won't be needing you.  whoever told them they could carry a tune.  oh, yeah. me.  what.  the oh boyz are hotter than ever now.  their cds are sellg out worldwide.  selling out. my two favorite words.  this is a double deuce.  all of the money with none of the oh boyz.   yo.  mr. oh boyz record company man.  i think you misunderstood my father.  if you and your peeps do not cooperate, the oh boyz will continue to be missing.  stay missing.  give me a minute to compose my thoughts.  let me get back to you.  how can he get back to me.  i did not give him my number.  we're on our own.  yo, we don't even know how to be on our own.  who will get us our cocoa.  don't worry, guys. you've got me on your side.  we're doomed.  okay, fine. you've got him.  life without the oh boyz...  is heartbreaking.  you seem real upset.  miss possible, the oh boyz are like sons to me.  but what can i do.   sorry, got to take this.  yo. go baby.  junior: we are not your baby.  father: junior, give me the phone.  must be a wrong number.  don't think so.  and i hate to tell you, but i definitely know those voices.  you do.  a bad idea.  we'll give you another chance.  junior, please let me talk.  father, i'm speaking.  i have... it's my turn.  son... father.  oh, yeah. i've got everything i need.  you mean.  that's right.  i know where to find ron and the oh boyz.  i can't believe our fates are in the hands of a rat and that contraption.  that's a naked mole rat to you, and that contraption is going to get out of here.  right, so you know what it is.  of course.  no idea.  wait. clever.  it fires the disc player's laser in a tightly focused mini beam to deactivate the lock.  dexter, the smart one. it's not just hype.  that is what it does, right.  duh.  we're back withman overboard.  well, gentlemen, the viewers have voted.  how do you feel, brad.  hope it isn't me, i guess.  oh, too bad.  brad, you've been voted off the boat and you are going overboard.  it's up to you, christy.  you want to throw him a lifeline.  this has to be the most heinous show ever.  you should have seen the last one i worked ontruth or volcano.  anyway, thanks for the lift, judd.  are you kidding, kim.  it's the least i could do after you rescued me from that rhino stampede.  oh, that was no big.  what was that show called again.  teasing wild animals.  come on, christy. throw it.  yes. every international pop sensation needs a sensational autograph.  hmm.  what.  ah. my favorite reality show. it can't be.  father. father.  kim possible is coming to foil my birthday present.  ah, excellent. i relish the challenge.  so far so good.   welcome, kim possible.  it's so nice you could drop by.   whoa.   miss possible, i have gone to a great deal of trouble to mutate an octopus.  you've got the most whacked hobbies.  i have been dreaming of watching u do battle with him.  well, keep dreaming.  i would appreciate it very much if you would continue your fall now.  thanks, but no thanks.  ah, i am loathe to force the issue, but...    boo ya.  let's hit it, guys. i'm first.  i'm the leader. i'm older. i'm cuter.  i'm smarter. i thought of it first.  hey, this is no way for troubadours of love to behave.  hmm.  selfactivating, motionsensitive laser cannons.  those bad boys are no joke.  in that case, you first.  me. you're the one that can't sing.  you've always been the weakling.  your dancing totally tanks.   wade, got a serious 911 on my hands.  talk to me.  the recipe for my current disaster: start with a nasty deep pit.  add me.  stir in one killer octopus.  are we talking regular octopus or mutant.   definitely mutant.   what a beautiful sight.  junior, you do not want to miss this.  not now, father. i'm working on my r's.  hmm. hmm.  chill, guys.  i know how to handle this.  you do.  yep. we close our eyes and runall together.  i figure only half of us will get fried.  which half. my guess is the left.  anyone have a better idea.  as a matter of fact...  on my count, "quit playing games with my head."  let's not analyze what i said    i don't want to be a complex boy    i can't tell if you're serious when you are so delirious    are you done playing me, baby.    is that a yes, no or maybe.    quit playing games with my head    i'm a sport, but i'm not a toy    let's not analyze what i said...   kim. can you hear me.  listenwhen octopi are mutated, certain traits get amplified.  including responsive nerve endings.  wade, short version please.  he's ticklish.  ticklish. you've got to be kidding.  under the armpits.  all eight of them.    i don't want to be a complex boy    boy, boy, boy, boy, boy.   check us out.  you guys are just like regular guyguys now.  you're right.  we actually just did something for ourselves.  feels good, doesn't it.  feels weird.  but in a good way, i guess.  now, we thwart the bad guy.  wait until you see how good that feels.   charge.   cootchiecoo.  how can this be.  kim possible has tickled my mutant octopus into submission.  it's worse than that, father.  my ticket to stardom is gone.  who's that.  kim possible. teen hero. cheerleader.  hi.  wow. youare the cutest one.  did roland send you.  oh, yeah.  he was very worried about you.  why'd he hang up on the ransom calls.  kim: um, about that...  enough. you are all testing my patience.  now you will test my latest toy.  i thought you said it wasn't a toy, father.  it's an expression.  that is a good look on you. you can be my opening act.  that was just the low setting. now let's see who's hot on the charts.  father.  junior, are you all right.  do i look tanner now.  because the pain may be worth it.  come, junior. we will fight another day.  but, father, how will i become a super pop star now.  girl: are robby's eyes really the color of the sea.  is ryan's favorite food pizza.  did you get dexter's email address.  does nicky nick have a new girlfriend yet.  one at a time, ladies.  one at a time.  all questions will be answered.  all mysteries solved.  when, ron.  as soon as i get a refill.  i'll get it. no, me.  he asked me.  enjoying yourself.  like i said, kim, i don't follow trends, i start them.  besides, who knows how long the oh boyz will be hot this time.  i'm working it.  yeah, i see that.  i hope they at least did something about that record company weasel.  whoa.  hey, boys. you're back.  you don't know how i missed you.  no, i think we do, roland. that's why...  ...we've asked the boys upstairs...  ...to fire you.  you're joking.  who could possibly take my place.    quit playing games with my head    i'm a sport, but i'm not a toy    let's not analyze what i said    i don't want to be a complex boy    i
