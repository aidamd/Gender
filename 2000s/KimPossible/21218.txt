 just getting started.  whoa, whoa, hey. hold on. time out.  you have a battle suit.  where did you get this suit with the powers.  it's relatively new. and indestructible.  ..  oh, it's most impressive, but we will take the springing out of your stepping shoe.   uh, right. running.  oh, look at that, for peter's sake.  maybe someone might take a minute to fill me in next time.  the little details, like my small girl enemy becoming suddenly over.  aah. aah.   you have never had the springy jump, selfhealing super suit before.  i'm full of surprises.  yes, well, you are not the only one, fraulein.  now with the hand.  .  shake hands.  a little help.  help.  you help your socalled boyfriend while i help myself to escape.     you ok, socalled boyfriend.  uhhuh.  monique: can you believe it.  the day is here. we're actually seniors.  we're older, we're wiser.  we rule the school.  yeah. i guess so.  what's your problem, girl.  where's your senior spirit.  it's just that we had our first runin of senior year, and the bad guy got away.  no one bats a thousand, kim.  besides, you still kick major battle suit butt.  aah.  and your main man's mad running away skillstop shelf.  so, are you two, like, still together.  yes, bonnie.  i mean, i know things got noxious at the junior prom, but you had all summer to come to your senses.  so have you.  but you're a cheerleader, a senior cheerleader.  you know what that means.  new uniforms.  well, yes, and they're so cute.  but it also means you must date a jock.  ..it's nonoptional.  it's like a rule.  ron's the exception to the rule. hmm.  he's the reason for the rule.  if he can't step up, trade up.  not everyone has to date the quarterback, b.  not everyone can, k.  oh, that girl's sweet as ever.   gotta run.  promise me you won't obsess on bonnie's little whatever, ok.  what little whatever.  the whole must date a jock rule.  oh, yeah. yeah, whatever.   some girls do like to date jocks.  big deal. who cares.  it's not like kim would ever dump me to trade up.  would she.  i mean, just because she's a cheerleader  go, jocks. heh. shh.   wait. i'm a cheerleader. i'm the mad dog.  that must count for something.   man: hey, clown boy.  get out of the road.  don't count for nothing, does it.  mmmm.  ok, chill. kim is not bonnie.  me and k.p. live in a tradeup free zone.  whoa, kim. are you serious. trading up.  kim: i hate to admit it, but in this one case, oh, i actually agree with bonnie.  never thought i'd hear those words from you, kim.  it's a little scary. i know, monique.  but a girl has to have standards, especially now that we're seniors.  it's time you traded up.  but my little celly has been with me since freshman year.  you have to admit, bonnie's new cell phone is ultimate.  you heard it, rufus.  now that we're seniors, i'm not good enough for kim.  i wish she wasn't a cheerleader.  .. uhoh.  time for ronstoppable to step up and become ron stepupable.  as you all know, after 7 years, brick flagg graduated last june, leaving the mad dogs without a quarterback.  you realize these tryouts aren't for towel boy.  that position is already filled.  uhhuh.  barkin, you're looking at the new middleton quarterback.   you think you're quarterback material with your name.  ron. stoppable.  sends the wrong message to the opposition.  but i can do this, mr. b., i've got hustle.  buckets of hustle.  playing the hustle card, eh.  all right. let's see how you dance.  ok. whoa. ugh.   why would you park there.  ugh. ugh.  we have a reception.  ok. let's see you pass.  oh, man.  take a lap.  i didn't say run the lap.  what's up, ladies.  and you're doing what.  i'm just relishing the exquisite torment that is the crab walk.  fun. it's a jock thing.  you wouldn't understand.  jock thing. you.  are you kidding.  ron stoppable has always been about the sportage.  ok, even if that was truefootball.  who doesn't like to toss around the old pig puck.  you mean pigskin.  whoa, k.p. one sport at a time.  ron, this wouldn't have anything to do with that trash bonnie was talking.  what. um, no.  i'm just fleshing out the resume for college.  well, i guess football reads better than flooding the school cafeteria.  huh. oh, right. the chess club incident.  the first rule of chess club is: you do not talk about chess club.   what up, seniors.  hey, wade. new sitch.  yeah, but no telling what.  just a mysterious hit on your site.  mysterious how.  all we got were gps coordinates.  it's my princess.  princess, eh. let me guess.  kidnapped foreign royalty.  oh, dear, no.  she just won't come down out of the tree.   , allow me to step up and handle this one.  nice kitty, you're such a niceow.  ow. man. with the cutting.  ow.  hey, you know, as long as you're suited up.  come on, princess.  aw, nice kitty.  no big. here you go.  oh, no, you must let me give you a proper thank you.  i'll be right back with the cookies.  and maybe some bandages.  if you got 'em. antiseptic, maybe.   nice lady. yeah.  a little off. kinda creepy.  cookies to go. so to go.  quite a collection of, um, these things.   hey.   i knew that cat was evil.  we've been played.  woman: analyzing battle suit.  aah.  bad granny. bad granny.   i recognize that laugh.  oh, dear me.  it is appearing that we are all out of the cookies.  kim, this granny is demented.  ron, you mean dementor.  peeking ze boo.  ha ha ha ha ha.  cute little trap, professor.  why, thank you. yes, i rather like it.  it's the details that really sell it, don't you think.  i picked out the curtains myself.  dude, you're totally wearing a dress.  it's a housecoat. yeah. uhhuh.  dress. enough with the chat.   aah.  ugh.  aah. hard candy.  kim.  ha ha ha ha.  danke, kitty.  it is looking like i am in the hot water, yes.  ha ha ha. no.  ugh.  there is no hot water for me.  not this time, fraulein possible.  not ever.  oh. i have been foiled by a man in a dress.  it's a housecoat.   see, this is why i'm not a cat person.  come on.   it was a trap, wade.  professor dementor.  in a dress.  sounds ugly. but you had the battle suit.  and he had the home field advantage.   home field home field    home field     how much longer is he gonna be that way.  i'm not sure.  but it's kind of weirding me out.   oh. hey, guys.  zoning out why.  um, nothing.  say, we'd better get rolling so you can get to babysitting tonight 'cause tonight you'll be out babysitting and you won't be home, 'cause you'll be out babysitting away from home, right.  you're still not right, are you.  me. oh, yeah.  i'm feeling just super.  hmm.  it's not stealing. it's secret borrowing.   uh. uh. uh.   stoppable, are you still wasting my time.  there's no way you're gonna make the quarterback cut.  just one more chance, mr. b.  ah, what's it gonna hurt.  aside from his skin and bone.  i'll just have the nurse warm up the crash cart.  all right, now, check it.  ooh. you ok there, coach.  ok. i'm stoked.  that pass was impossible.  heh. yeah. something like that.  you're the field general, the signal caller, the man.  middleton, we have a quarterback.  announcer: it's a beautiful night for some football here in middleton.  there's the snap.  the new mad dog quarterback has all kinds of time.  he's moving in the pocket.  ..  that's a 30 yard completion.  ..  uh, go mad dogs.  1st and 10 in lowerton territory.  oh. call the crash cart.  good night, nurse. he's ok.  ladies and gentlemen, stoppable's unstoppable.  go unstoppable.  here we go, folks.  this could be the play of the game.  the lowerton defense dog piles on the rookie, .. the kid is on the move.  touchdown mads.  middleton has a new hero.   he did it.  i know. unbelievable.  yeah, a little too unbelievable, if you ask me.  so ron stepped up. jealous much.   it is kind of weird, though, isn't it.  maybe all that running from bad guys has finally paid off.  ron:.  i'm so proud of you, ron.  i never knew you had this in you.  never. heh.  like you, i'm full of surprises.   huh.  aah.  earthquake. unlikely.  oh, yoohoo.  is it a bad time for the knocking.     . red, blue, green lights .  . flicker undercover .  . miss

conqueror of everybody.  yeah, that's going to happen, like, never.  oh, and you intend to stop me once again by using your fancy battle suit.  well, uh, actuallytoo bad.  you see, during our last encounter, i secretly analyzed its abilities ..  magnetic controller.  your fancy pants will become your very undoing.  why, even now, you feel your arms, legs locking up, fusing you into immobile helplessness, as i, professor dementor, take full control.   all your battle suit now belongs to me.  sorry to harsh your scheme, professor, but i'm not wearing it.  do i look like i am fooled by your mouthful of lies.  no. is the correct answer.  does it look like i'm wearing full body armor.  well, no, now that you mention it.  and yet, my instruments very clearly say the suit is here.  with that, what is up.    remotely activating shield mode.  ahh. i so hate that.  so, who's wearing the girly clothes now.  ..  you stole my battle suit.  secret borrowing.  oh. you were in my closet.  look, let me explain, ok.  first off, this suit pinches.  not that it doesn't look good on you.  not that your teen relationship issues aren't fascinating, but i'd really like to jump right into crushing kim possible with her own super suit.  hey, hey, bad suit. kim, look out.  uhh.  you cheated your way onto the football team.  yeah, but that was just a perk.  i was really trying to cheat on you.  uhh.  for you. uh, to win you.  wait, wait. it's not what you think.  oh, so you're not a cheater, a liar, and a thief.  ok, it is what you think.  butbut, kim, i had to do it.  i couldn't risk losing you.  what are you talking about.  you weren't going to lose me.  i, um, heard you talking to monique.  you agreed with bonnie about dating jocks.  you said trading up was the only option.  ..  i was talking about monique's cell phone.  ohh. yeah.  she's got that new one like bonnie's. that's a nice phone.  uhhuh.  oh, wait.  ...  .  ron, i don't care about dating a jock.  i care about dating youron stoppable, no matter who he is.  as long as he's honest.  i'm sorry, kim. i never meant to hurt you.  not yet.  no. no. it's not me.  it's your battle suit.  oh, k.p., our first fight.  kim.  did you say your battle suit.  oh, man. even as a senior.  no, no. my battle suit.  ha ha ha ha.  not as comfy as the house dress, but i'll learn to live.   whee.  final crushing blow delivered by my own, superenhanced bad self.  ooh. what.   ow. uhh.  hey, stop hitting yourself.  i cannot.  ..oof. this isn't fair.  my battle suit.  announcer: time's running out.  stoppable is off his game tonight.  i don't need a suit.  i can do this.  ..  ..  i'm outta here.  announcer: where is he going.  what is he doing.  gee, kim, is that your boyfriend out there running like a sick chicken.  yeah. that's my guy.  announcer: wait. he's turning around.  ..  he's breaking the all middleton rushing record.  where did he learn to run like that.  mad dogs win. mad dogs win.  booyeah.   you do me proud, ron stoppable by just being you.  who knew my mad running away skills would have real world applications.  too bad you had to go and cheat your way onto the team.  cheater.  does this mean i don't get to be the quarterback anymore.  it's called disciplinary action.  something we coaches do.  oh, man.  that's right.  i want you to think about what you've done when you're playing as the new middleton running back.  you mean i still get to be on the team.  ha ha. oh, talk to me after 20 laps.  thanks, mr. b. huh.  save your running for game time.  captioning made possible bydisney abc
