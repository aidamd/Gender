 have always been the center of the universe.  i just found out about it recently.  ugh.   hmm.  huh. huh.  that's weird.  yeah, it is.  i'm calling wade.  hey, kim, how's ron.  tell him i could really go for some lasagna.  how about stopping by italy for me.  was that a shot.  paris is blacked out, wade.  what's the sitch.  let me scan the news sites.  wow. it's not just paris.  rolling blackouts all over europe.  can you patch the communicator into the european grid.  done.  great. and we'll need some transportation.  no problem.  i've done some consulting work for a french aeronautics firm.  they'll help out.  this cannot be safe.  uh, wade, i'm kind of with ron on this one.  don't be babies.  the pilotless drone chopper is awesome.  the military uses it for missions too risky for human beings.  i've traced the drain to eight degrees one minute west 46 degrees north.  but my map shows nothing out there.   "nothing" left its lights on.  wade, take us down.  gently.  whoa.  that's a reallybig lightbulb.  no wonder there's no power in europe.    uh, hello.  father. i see people.  they must be the new servants.  very good, very good.  you have brought more lightbulbs.  did you bring lightbulbs.  i'm kim possible, and this is ron stoppable.  ahwelcome, welcome to my home.  we have only just turned everything on.  i am seor senior, sr.  and this is my son, seor senior, jr.  your haircut, it is very nice.  i use le goop.  as do i.  but your clothes, they do not harmonize.  i know. i'm all over it, dude.  i was just going to take a quick ski down my indoor mountain.  care to join me.  no, thank you, seor...  seor senior.  some refreshment, perhaps.  oh, i have some lovely juice.  quite amazing, really.  it comes in a box.  a juice box would be nice.  : i want to ski.  yeah, okay, juice is good.  kim: i guess what i'm saying is energy is a precious resource.  it's up to each and every one of us to do our part.  so, a little ecoawareness might be in order here.  oh, i am but a simple multibillionaire.  i can't believe that what i do has any effect on anyone.  yeah, um your house sucks up so much power it's causing blackouts all over europe.  and these people without powerthey are inconvenienced.  very.  you see, junior, how awful it is to be poor.  but, uh, what can i do.  well, for starters youcouldturn off that giant sun lamp.  but if i am to be a teen pop star i need a robust tan.  later. oh, i want to hear again about this "lowflow shower head." there's a ton of things that you can do to make your house more efficient.  house. more like a lair.  lair. oh, i do not like the sound of that.  it's too... sinister.  this place screams sinister.  it's on a private island that isn't on any map.  i value my privacy.  what can i tell you.  come on, look at all the chrome.  you've got doors that go, that go "whoosh." i always wondered about the whoosh.  i like the whoosh.  it's the door saying "i am closed." it's fine, sir.  ignore him.  all i'm saying is that a guy could take over the world from a place like this.  i mean, really, it wouldn't take much.  maybe a communications jamming system some missiles probably throw in some traps you know, selfactivating lasers an indoor lagoon full of piranha.  piranha. why ever would i want piranha.  to eat the good guys.  just put in some fluorescentsthat should do the trick.  i'd also think about a secret underground grotto with a speedboat for escape purposes.  andandandand gigantic spinning tops of doom.  they'd be huge, and they'd destroy anything in their path.  come on, mr. spinningtopsofdoom.  i've got homework.  goodbye.  and thank you.  i hope the one with the nice haircut finds better trousers.  yes, but his ideas...  i have so much money and free time...  i could use a hobby.  why didn't you beat him up.  i'm not going to beat up a guy just because he's using too much power.  you could have kicked him.  i left him some pamphlets.  well, all you kids could stand to turn off a few lights.  dinner.  tada.  mom, is that....  brain. cool. i want a lobe.  boysplease.  sorry.  may iplease have a slice of steaming human brain.  please.  first ron, now my family.  has everyone lost their...  that issogross.  kimmy, it's just meat loaf.  i'm making it for the neurosurgeon's potluck.  thought i'd try it on you guys first.  kudos on the realism.  huh. uncanny.  so, uh, what's up with ronald.  something you want to talk about.  yeah, but i guess i should be talking to him.  may i be excused.  i'll save you a plate, honey.  boys, left hemisphere or right.   hey, hey, you've reached the home of ron stoppable and his fierce new haircut.  leave a message.  how can ron not be home.  okay, better page him.   oh, dude, i am beyond not feeling this shirt.  look at my hair.  you got to key off the hair.     you and ron at all squared away.  not.  i can't even reach him.  dad, did you ever try to change a friend to make them better.  well, not a human, but back in grad school therewas this lab rat.  pinky joe curlytail, i called him.  poor little guy was always running mazes for those psych majors.  how i hated them.  dad.  what does this have to do with me.  well, it seemed to me that pinky joe curlytail was just so helpless.  i constructed a very tiny cybertronic battle suit...  for the rat.  no more mazes for him.  yeah, in retrospect giving him a working plasma blaster probably went too far.  blew up half the science building.  rampaged across campus.    oh, pinky joe.  so... this creatingamonster thing runs in the family.  saved you some brain loaf, kimmy.  if i said the ron trouble is rising would you come back with a story about a psycho rat.  no. but i might work in an "i told you so." what's happening, mama.  oh, hey, where were you last night.  i paged and...  whoa.  what happened toyou.  ron stoppable has arrived.  amelia babe, let's lunch.  okay.  oh, pinky joe.    rufus, what are you doing out here.  come on, let's get you into ron's locker.  wow.  yes, ameliawow.  the secret is the sea urchin.  excuse me.  ron...  what is with you.  if you mean, am i the new ron.  yes, i am.  i got to say, i don't think the old ron would have ever left rufus on the floor.  he was almost hallway roadkill.   rufus, you got to be more careful.  what if something happened to you.   whoa, bro.  careful of the 'do, babe.  so there's no room for rufus in your new life.  yes, there is.  there's just no room for him in my new pants.  leather. you like.  walk me to history, ron.  booyah.   come on. you can live inmylocker.    yeah, i liked him that way too.  kim...  we've got troublebigtime trouble.  what's the damage, wade.  the damage is seor senior, sr.  i thought you said he was harmless.  yeah.  rich... but harmless.  he sucked up all the power in western europe.  okay.i'll go back and make sure he turns off some of his lights.  it's going to take more than that, kim.  seor senior, sr.'s taking europe's power on purpose.  check this out.  my evil vow is this.  i will send europe back into the dark ages unless the euro alliance gives me...  their nice little islands.  kim: nice little islands.  with the warm beach days and hot disco nights.  they are obviously new at the bigtime villain thing.  that's what worries me.  i'll get ron.  we've got to save europe.   hmm... "evil chortle".  no, not for me.  ah... "the evil snicker."  all right, that will do for now.  junior.  any word from the euro alliance.  somebody called, i don't know who.  did you think to take a message.  i did not.  i'm not your message taking person.  if you want your own island you will think to take a message.   look, ron stoppable returns.  has he gotten new trousers.  yes.  scuba trousers.  so then amelia ran up and said, "brad pitt" but she tapped me on the shoulder, and...  ron, we're sneaking here.  sorry.  brad pitt, though.  whoa.  double whoa.  he's been busy.  get down.  oh, good.  missiles.  i am so glad you told him to get missiles.  oh, so i made a few suggestions.  does that make it my fault.  one hundred percent.   is that what i think it is.  that's how he's draining the power.  come on, let's get this settled.  how are you planning on getting inside.  the door.  seor senior, sr., open up.  ah, kim possible.  my feisty... ron: hey.  you put in a lagoon.  the piranha won't be here till monday.  but i assure you, the koi have not been fed in days.  i ordered this book on world domination off the internet.  it said you'd be coming back.  have you gotten to the chapter where you give yourself up.  no, actually, i'm up to the part where i tell you that it is too late for you to stop my evil plan.  oh, man, i have a zit on my nose.  will you get over yourself.  you do, too. right there.  selfactivating lasers.  "throw in some traps." hey, on the positive side this guy is clearly a terrific listener.  seor senior, sr. is really starting to get on my nerves.  should pleather lose its sheen so quickly.  senior: kim possible.  here is a good targetmiddleton.  i'm going to attack your hometown.  junior, go to the tower and activate the missiles.  oh, now i'm your missile launching person, too.  junior just split.  i'll deal with senior. you go after junior.  keep an eye on him.  the old ron may still be inside there somewhere.  oh...  you think you're out of trouble.  well, you're not out of trouble.  farewell, kim possible.    spinning tops of doom.  why do i have to launch his stupid missiles.  step away from the console.  oh, step away from your bossy attitude.  you think just because you're so nicely dressed...     no, you don't.   oh, you are going to pay.  junior: no.     huh.  look at me.  what have i become.  i do not know, what.  my ronness.  ii feel it.  yeah.  this look works.  what look.  let me see.  but your hair is all messy.  it's so, so...  totally me.   whoa. the stairs. use the stairs.   kim.   get down.  come on.  thanks.  never, never tell anyone to go out and buy spinning tops of doom.  you've got to be careful about what you say, ron.  i mean, one little thing...  like, "you need a new hairstyle".  yeah.  like that.  sorry.  you know what the worst thing is.  pleather doesn't breath.   kim: secret grotto and a speedboat.  great for escapes.  you know, i am so not talking to anyone ever again.  come on, let's ace this place.  so, it wasn't really the haircut that made me popular.  what people saw was confidence.  so i lose the haircut, keep the confidence and i'm chauncy.  hey, amelia, we still on for after school.  after school with you.  and do what.  geek out.  come on, it's... it's me, it's ron.  what... so i, so i ditched the 'do.  it's what's inside that matters, right.  right.  like, who told you that, loser.  woo.  see.  someone likes you just the way you are.  captioning sponsored by theu.s. department of education anddisney channel captioned bymedia access group at wgbh . todd and riley were, oh, so sad . then they came 'cross a

this just came in the mail.  oh, come on, honey.  i think 45 seconds is a long enough time to make any lifechanging decision.  mom, you have to let me join the exchange program.  i've already got my heart set on my host country some place mildly exotic, englishspeaking and bordering the united states.  is it the ivory coast.  is it loserssaywhereville.  where.  exactly. haha.  well, what country, dear.  wait, it's not mississippi, is it.  mom, that's a state.  that's what they want you to think.  ok.  i'm going to canada.  not all flashy like belgium, or all smug like uruguay.  just slightly above average...  like yours truly.  canada. their coasts aren't made of ivory.  and you'll have to learn canadian.  and they ride around on elephants all day.  dad, isn't that india.  todd. i believe the proper term is "native america." won't your friends miss you.  what about johnny.  johnny. whatevs.  we're totally on hiatus.  the last time i called him, he was so... cold.  so, johnny, let's talk about our feelings.  it's really not a good time, riley.   not a good time. what do you mean, it's not a good time.  save my baby. save my orphan kitten.  get him, polar bears.  anyway, who cares about jerkface johnny.  i'm going to the great white north.  plus, you guys won't even miss me.  it says here an exchange student will come to live with you while i'm gone.  so riley leaves and we get some canadian dweeb in return.  hmm.      todd, why are you laughing like you just came up with a sneaky scheme to take advantage of the exchange student.  because i just came up with a sneaky scheme to oh, just go to canada already.  remember, riley, those canadians will stick a "u" in the middle of word without warning.  and they love their ginger ale.  and their bacon is all kinds of crazy.  ohh. i'm gonna miss you guys, too.  i think i've said all my goodbyes...  mom, dad, todd, abbey, tasumi, not johnny.  think that's everyone.    yep, that's everybody.  well, it's been fun.  don't
