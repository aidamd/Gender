" so, what exactly do you know about hana's adoption agency.  you mean, aside from it being a secret cover for project tot kwon do.  yeah, aside from that.   hey, wade, you get any traction on that scroll monkey fist dusted.  well, the good news is that the museum did scan a copy of it when they added it to their collection.  that is good news.  i determined it's a map to the hidden valleys of a simian canyon.  and, guys, i don't know why, but it mentions the han a lot.  han. wwhat does it say.  well, that's the bad news.  without the other half of the scroll, it doesn't say much.  like, even where simian canyon is.  yeah, but what about han.  well, there's some connection between han andand. a dark destroyer called the yono.  oh, no. dark destroyer.  pfft, no big.  if we had a nickel for every one of those we smacked down, right.  yeah, we'd have many nickels.  wade: it's not an adoption agency.  ..  kim: a pet store.  so, my sister came from a pet store.  are we sure this place is legit.   oh, yeah, you know, i'd recognize that sweet bouquet of hamsters and guppies any day of the week.  though i must say, i'm unimpressed with their limited chew toy selection.  blah.  can i help you.  uh, yeah, show us to your bin of super ninja babies, please.  uh, we don't have a lot of chew toys if that's what that is.  hi, um, yeah, do you know how long this store has been here.  this is our grand opening.  not so grand to me.  any scoop on the previous tenant.  sorry, long gone before we got here.  if you'll excuse me.  ahh, the scroll, the store.  all our leads are dead ends.  hey, you know, we are still getting junk mail from before.  sweet.  oh, no way.  who is it. who's the tenant.  i don't know, but look at this deal on carpet cleaning.  how can they afford to stay in business.  the address, ron, who was it sent to.  both: the yamanouchi adoption agency.  yamanouchi.  care of mr. sensei.  han really is a ninja baby.  ok, weird, heavily weird.  why did sensei pose as an adoption agency to secretly hook me up with a baby ninja sister.  i can't believe what you just said is actually sounding plausible to me.  wipes, are you sure you've got enough wipes.  mom, the diaper bag is stocked.  you're a terrific big brother, ronnie.  it's nice that you want to spend time with your little sister.  oh, it's just a quick day trip to japan, mom.  ok, catch you later.  see, your mom said you were a good big brother, so, it must be true.  yeah, until han busts out of the baby bag an decides to do laps on the wing.  ok, come on, han, here, come here.  all right, let's try the book again, ok.  this time, use your whole arm.  page, page.  ..  ok, hana, this is the good part.  whee.  whoa, whoa.   and this is the bad part.   this is kind of spooky.  ooh.  where is everybody.  oh, huh, hey.  uhh.  kim possible, it is you.  i am so sorry for the confusion.  yori.  yori.  yori.  ha, how's my favorite ninja.  oh, there you are, little han.   ah, baby always gets the love.  my apologies, stoppablesan, but han is like a little sister to me.  yeah, me too.  i mean, since we got her from the pet store.  sensei, he has been expecting you, stoppablesan.  that's probably because he forgot to give me the instruction book to my wild, little, super ninja sister.  instruction book.  yeah, we just have a few questions, and we'll be out of your hair.  oh, i see, by suggesting you would leave us in our time of need, you are making more of your americanstyle jokes.  heh heh, yeah. say whawait, what.  yori, about that time of need thing.  where is everyone.  only sensei and i remain as guardians.  everyone else has been sent away for safety.  safety.  sensei anticipates bad events.  but, like, accidentally losing my pants in public kinda bad.  or, like, eating a plate of nacos and finding a hair in the cheese kinda bad.  eww.  sensei: though this hair conundrum you speak of sounds bad, i do fear something much worse.  sensei.  monkey fist will unearth yono.  the destroyer. that yono.  ok, worse than hairy cheese.   that's it, keep digging.  we're getting close, i can feel it.  yes, yes, let me see it.    yes, yes.  the dark temple of the yono.   i am yono.  the destroyer, really.  word.  so, you claim to be the great destroyer.  what part of yono the destroyer confuses you.  the short part.  oh, i'm impressed, but not entirely convinced.  ah, ah, ah, this time without the cheap light show.  so it shall be.  no flash, just crash.   hmm, want you to see more.  oh, yes.  in fact, i want to see it all when you crush my enemies.  so, you are willing to follow the dark path of the yono.  yes, lead me to my destiny through your power.  as it is to be wished.  now that the yono is mine, soon, too, shall i have the han.  i wiexcuse me, where are you going.  to school.  ok, wait a minute, let me see if i've got this straight.  you secretly placed han in my family so i could prepare her for a showdown with a malevolent, mystic monkey.  both: correct.  ron:.  this is my way of telling you.  oh, i see, yes, yes, interesting.  well, um, if i had known i was supposed to be teaching her ninja skills, i would have, like, you know, i don't know, maybe taught her some ninja skills.  aah, who am i kidding.  i can't even teach her how to turn a page in a book, much less take out some evil dude.  i mean, look, look, look at this.  ..doing the flippie dance   ..    see, ron try teach dance.  baby no dance, no dance.   ron, are you ok.  no, i'm not ok.  my baby sister is going to be crushed by an evil entity because i'm the worst big brother in the whole world.  don't worry, we won't let anything happen to hana.  we will fight to our last breath.  perhaps you should take time with han to reflect on the value of your relationship as brother and sister.  surely your time has not been completely wasted.  brother.   poor han, so blissfully innocent and unprepared for your big showdown.  all thanks to me.   huh, hey, thanks, kiddo.  well, i guess if nothing else, i've taught you the value of a family that loves you.  who's a boobah.   hey, what are youpage.  hey, hey, hey, that's right, page.  han, can you turn the page.  page.    han, you rock. whoa.  maybe i was teaching you more than i realized.  brother.  oh, come on, sister, we've got to show this off.   the time, it is upon us.  monkey fist: oh, yoohoo, yono calling.  yono: hello.  ah, the welcoming committee.  on the contrary, you are most unwelcome here.  surrender the han, and i'll spare you my wrath.  yeah, that's going to happen, like, never.  never may be sooner than you think.  the han. now.  what do you want with ron's baby sister anyway.  looking for an intellectual peer.  so hilarious.  ..  ..  the infant. how blind i've been.  the han isn't a weapon, it's a person.  interesting.  finish them.  oh, yeah, uhhuh, we bad.  ohh.  sensei, areno.   yori.   .  ..what.  yori.  stoppablesan.  oh, no. kim.  it is up to you and han now.  ..   this is all my fault.  admiring my handiwork.  monkey fist. dude, you are going down, hard.  give me the han, boy, or you will regret it, i promise you.  oh, oh, oh, how could youyou know what. you are going down, uh, harder.  yeah.  you had your chance.  whoa.  come to me, han.  i will raise you as my own and school you in monkey evil.  stay away from my sister.  hi.  aah, where are my monkey powers when i need 'em.  come, han, come with me, and together we will rule the world with the destructive power of the yono.  hah.  whatwhat, how are you.  ccut that out.  hey.  allowing me.  han.
