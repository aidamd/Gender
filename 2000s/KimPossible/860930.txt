 ack to shego for a minute.  your sister.  and at one time a fellow hero.  shego good.  she and i and the rest of our family, we were team go.   good times. good times.  we kept go city safe from evil, but the more we fought evil, the more shego liked it.  the fighting.  the evil.  right. once shego went bad, itas neverhe same.  the team broke upall of our fantastic powers, idled.  so, how'd you get your powers.  it began when we were children.  lady fate came aknockin', and she knocked hard.  what was that.  a glowing, rainbowcolored comet that gave each of us special powers.  i knew it was destiny.  we were meant to use our powers to help the world.  of course, now, the go team glow of superstength belongs to you.  please, take your rightful place.  mmm...  comfy.  not you.  ah...  and that's nothisseat.  look, this just isn't how things are done in the go tower.  there are certain procedures and protocols.  hego, i say we find aviarius, get that powerdraining thing and switch your superpowers back to you.  oh, k.p., use your superstrength again.  come on, please.  fine.  you know what. keep the powers. they rock.  those powers are a great responsibility.  and they totally rock.  oh, come on. you know the drill.  use your go team glow.  i don't have my go team glow anymore, you big dolt.  aviarius stole your power.  yes. who are you.  kim possible.  what was your power.  ooh, ooh, were you like some kind of fire guy.  no.  purple... purple.  did your powers involve bruising in some way.  no.  hmm.  he's a shrinker.  oh, really. well, i'm sure that shrinking can be very useful.  you better believe it can.    hi.  why is there a bald rat inmychair.  beat it.   oh, shut your cheese hole.   i can't believe i lost my powers.  you have no idea how horrible it is, how empty i feel.  actually, mego, idoknow.  i, too, lost my powers.  uh, hego, let's focus here. onme.  we need to figure out where aviarius is going to strike next.   the twins. the twins.  greetings, team go.  you have something i want and i have somethingyouwant.  you'll never get away with this, aviarius.  never. like he said.  hey, it's the go tower.  there's hego and mego.  hi, guys. hi, guys.  i will not rest until all of the powers of team go are mine to control.  surrender the superstrong girl, or you'll never see the twins again.  so, you know where aviarius is.  oh, yes. that's his lair.  he calls it...  the nest.  yes.  you know, this guy needs to dig deeper.  so where is the mountain, the himalayas.  no, that's the peak of go mountain, just outside of go city.  convenient.  i found that a longdistance relationship with a foe never works.  it's a strain on everyone.  hego, how did you defeat aviarius in the past.  teamwork.  or as i like to call it, gooperation.  haha, good one.  yeah.  i'm starting to see why shego split.  and we're going to have to get her back.  no, no, no, really, i'm listening. go on.  this rare mutagenic agent that you stole for me will unlock the key to...   knock, knock.  kim possible..  since when do you glow.  like hego.  greetings, sister.  hey, shego.  you know, you missed my birthday.  a call, a cardany acknowledgment would be nice.  uh, i believe some introductions are in order here.  i'm ron stoppable. we've met before, but you never seem to remember my name.  can you excuse us, dr. d.  shego, as long as you're going to live under my roof, you'll follow my rules.  and rule number one: no secrets.  whatever is going on...  is obviously a private matter.  later, gators.  you know, i do think of us as a kind of evil family, and families stick together.  so if you need me...  i'll be there for you.  looks like all of my leastfavorite people in the world have gotten together to form a club. why.  aviarius.   it's great to have you back on the team, sis.  here's my plan.  you, don't talk.  seriously, hego, give it a rest.  the whole team leader thing is so old.  yeah, yousame as him.  all right, let me see if i got this right: possible and i are the only ones with power.  uh, what about the power of imagination.  i believe we all have that.  that's true.  i'm starting to like this fellow.  he's a positive thinker.  and you people wonder why i quit.  father: kimberly ann possible.  hi, dad.  you know how i feel about circus folk.  actually, they're a team of superheroes.  their archfoe is out for revenge and...  sir, we'll get them back to the circus pronto.  see that you do, ronald.  what are we doing here.  we needed to meet someplace aviarius doesn't know about to make our plan.  well, the go tower is the ultimate fortress of goodness.  don't think so.  you've got a giant viewscreen that your archfoe can appear on whenever he wants.  he talks to you, you talk to him.  you don't think....  that he could use that technology to spy on us while we were planning our heroic efforts.  blast. the fiend.  how come no one never mentioned this before.  because it was obvious.   everybody, listen up.  here's what we should do...  so it wasn't just hego's strength.  she also got his superbossiness.   ugh. there is no way i can do this.  five minutes with my brothers and i'm ready to claw my own eyes out.  shego, i have brothers, too.  i know how annoying they can be, but you can't walk out.  why not.  because if you don't help, i'll tell the world you used to be a good guy.  you wouldn't.  i've got a web site and i'm not afraid to use it.  my reputation would be shot.   wade, i need a toptobottom tech scan on go mountain.  you got it, kim.  kim, is shego in your kitchen.  just do your computer thing, nerdlinger.  has she always been this cranky.  both: oh, yeah.   soon, the powers of team go will be mine.  at long last, control of go city will be mine.  and after so many years, vengeance will be mine.  mine, mine, mine.  he sounds like mego.   you know, i do not recommend that.  good to know for when i have hego's power.  not going to happen.  ooh, the complete set is within reach.   : see. shrinking comes in handy.  super strength is so much better.  both: thanks.  i rest my case.  oh, put a sock in it.  uh, guys.   i'm with the big guy.  mad love for the super strength.  and it must be mine.  heatseeking hummingbirds, fly.   hummingbirds.   oh, no.   release the flamingo of doom.  say what.  that is the secondbiggest flamingo i have ever seen.  .   need a little help.  are you offering.  i just don't want to lose to a giant flamingo, okay.  you hit him high.  and you hit him low.  you ladies talk too much.   go team, go.  oh, the red power lets you make copies of yourself.  ooh. cool.   yes, i have it all.  we still have one thing on our side.  yeah.  the power of imagination.   yeah, okay. all right, you're right.  we got nothing.  lovato.  jonas.  both: and this is radio disney's total access.   we are at disney world, actually.  and we are singing make a wave, the song for friends for change that we did and we've recorded, and we're performing it today.  . make wave, make a wave .  make a waveis going to be in the new disney naturemovieoceans that comes out on earth day and is the theme song forfriends for change this year.  . just a pebble in the water .  it's just basically saying that if you throw a pebble in the water, you could make a wave, so do your part to make a difference.  rehearsing together is fun.  we don't really typically ever really have a routine.  he likes to do some crazy dance moves sometimes like this.  tsst tsst tsst. we might even do the crossover.  tsst tsst tsst. i might even do this one.   i don't know what's going on.  it's nice to be able to just laugh about things, like, while we're onstage and just have a good time.  we're best friends, so we have a good time with it.  we read each other's minds.  yeah.  and so sometimes i can see his future whenever we sing together.  i see her past.  that's pretty much how we connect when we perform together.   yeah, so let's do this.  . so throw a pebble in the ocean .  every time we see fans out there sing the words and getting excited.  it makes us excited.  and that's what gets us pumped up.   is this a singoff. is this a singoff.  before going onstage, you can be really excited, but when you're onstage and you can see the fans singing the words andthat's the best feeling in the world is just to know that people love your music that much that they memorize all the words to your song.   . just a pebble in the water .  for us, it'sit's an amazing song.  ..  to us.  and i think joe feels the same, yep.  . make a wave .  . make a wave .  and that's radio disney's total access.   see, this is why i hate family reunions.  from now on, team go is a nogo.  i don't care how many powers this jerk has.  we can take him.  yeah, maybe.  but we need a distraction.   foolish boy.  ha. who's the fool now.  me, i'm still the fool.   no.  sucka.  sis, you did it.  both: awesome.  finally. now give me my powers back.  or...  or what.  or i could have all the powers.  condor, attack.   oh, yes, this works.  well, i tried.  shego, i thought we were in this together.  oh, come on. don't you know me better by now.  i mean, seriously.  she's right.  keeping everyone else's power for herself and using them for evilyeah, that's got more of the shego vibe.  no, i don't believe it.  you may be a cranky smartmouth, prone to excessive violence, but deep down, you are still a member of team goa hero.  hego, i quit your stupid team years ago and after i quit, i went to work for a guy who wants to take over the world.   it's true.  but deep down...  i am evil.  have i made myself clear.  super bad.  yeah, totally evil.  evil.  oh, i could have used all the powers at once.     i'm happy to be the distraction.  ron, it would take a huge distraction.   dr. drakken.  that's right, shego.  kim possible's computer kid told me how you were at the mercy of a villain.  where is this aviarius.  here he is.  dude, drakken knows who i am.  yes, the name escapes me, but i do know the air of buffoonery.  dr. d, i've got everything under control here.  kim: not so much.   go team, go.  get us out of here, fast.  drakken: can do.  and don't worry, shego.  you can thank me later.  looks like this bird is ready for his cage.   do you have to say that every time you capture me.  ron: i don't understand.  how can you not have the naco on the menu.  the naco didn't test well.  test. what test.  ten randomlyselected customers tastetested current and future menu items.  the mexi mushroom wraphuge.  wraps. that's the future of bueno nacho.  ugh. let me talk to these people.  i'm the one who's been saying, all along, we never should've quit.  being back together...  ...has been fun.  that's what i'm saying.  but we should reconsider who the team leader is.  if you ask me...  boy, it sounds like it got ugly.  do you really think shego would have gone through with it.  we're talking about shego.  but i got to say it was pretty easy to get that power staff from her.  drakken: i mean, really, you practically gave it to her.  whatever.  now that i know the whole story, i think you secretly wanted to lose.  what.  that's right.  you wanted your brothers to get their powers back.  you don't really have it in you to betray them.  are you saying that i am going soft.  as a marshmallow.   shego, i take it back.  you're not a softy. shego.  captioned by media access group at wgbh captioning made possible byabc cable networks group  todd and riley were, oh, so sad    then they came 'cross a fleemco ad   98    got a superspy mom
