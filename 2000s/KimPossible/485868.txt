questions for the article.  now, i understand in addition to cheering and being on the honor roll, somebody also saves the world from time to time, hmm.  oh, you know. no big.  well, i know our readers are going to want to know this: do you have time for a personal life.  oh, i make time.  i'll bet you're crushing on someone right now.  give us a hint.  his name is bobby johnson.  just moved here from upperton, but i'm not sure if i like him because i like him or because he asked out bonnie first.  i knew it.  well, that's some hint.  any cool hobbies.  oh, nothing special.  i collect cuddle buddies. i love them.  i can't get to sleep without my pandaroo.   cuddle buddies. yeah...  kim, i have to be honest with you.  we like our cover girls to be, ooh, how shall i put this.  um... trendforward.  there must be someother activity that you do regularly.  i pick my nose when nobody's looking.   anyone else want to be on the cover.  oohooh. i do, i do. me.  okay, kim, just tell yourself a big, fat lie.  you can do it.  the color of my hair is greee... red.  my name is possible.  the sky is blue.  prowrestling is... fake.  no.  wade, something's wrong with me.  i can only tell the truth and, and...  you spend too much time in your room.  it's just not healthy.  oh, i'm sorry.  okay, kim, i'll disregard that until we figure out what's up.  hold the communicator at arm's length.  scanning for weirdness.  well.  way weird.  it looks like all of your brain inhibitors are shut down.  meaning.  meaning you can't lie.  you can only blurt out the truth.  now let's look back at the last 24 hours.  the usual. got up, went to school.  fought shego. drakken zapped me with some funky ray thing.  whoa, whoa. what kind of ray.  don't know. it was yellow, i think.  a truth ray.  that's got to be it.  if i was hit, i'll bet ron was hit, too.  there's no telling what kind of trouble he's getting himself into.  all right, people.  i assume you all read and are prepared to discuss the classic novella, "lo, the plow shall till the soil of redemption." i did not and i am not.  wait. no.  what i meant to say is that i read...  only the first three pages.  i almost dislocated my jaw from yawning.  stoppable.  this book is snobby, pompous, overwritten, and the pictures were in black and white.  excuse me, mr. barken, but i agree with ron's criticism.  yeah. me too. um...  i just didn't have the guts to slam your favorite book.  uhhuh. yeah. that's right.  that's it. i've had it with this book.  i've despised "lo, the plow shall till the soil of redemption" ever since i had to suffer through it back in military school.  kids: yeah. yeah.  ron. ron. ron.  ron. ron. ron. ron. ron.  and you know what else.  i've never kissed a girl.  well, except for the cpr dummy in health class.  now, i know it's not the coolest thing to admit, but, hey, the truth sets you free.  dude, you tell it straight up.  ron, listen. we were both hit with a truth ray and...  no diggity. isn't it great.  great. hey, penny.  you have the most beautilicious eyes in school.  gosh, thanks, ron.  that's so sweet.  hey, i'll see you around, okay.  i tell it like it is.  ain't no shame in my game.  this rules.   what's the truth sitch, wade.  according to my research, the effects of the truth ray should wear off in about a day.   this is so my worst nightmare.  my worst nightmare is the one where i'm in school in my underwear. ron, you've actually done that.  i have to get home and tell mom and dad before his bigshot bosses get there.  mom, dad.  i gotta talk to you before...  dr. cook, dr. harris, dr. kramer.  you've met the twins.  this is my kimmy cup.  i hate it when he calls me that.    aren't you just the prettiest thing.  i have split ends and i'm trying to cover a mountainsize zit on my cheek that you just touched.  teenagers. always playing us squares.  why don't we adjourn to the living room while we wait for the chairman of the board to arrive, hmm.   and after churning and churning and churning, my greatgreat grandpapa finally made the first goat butter his village had ever seen.  wow. what a captivating story.  wasn't it guys.  oh, very.  : cool.  yeah.   kim.  uhuh.  we'll get it.  kimmy, what is wrong with you.  kim: i'm trying not to tell dr. kramer that you were right.  his stories about the old countrythey're pointless snore fests.  goat butter is not pointless.  it is delicious.  interestingly, in ancient syria, they would use a goatskin sack.  dad, you were right about dr. cook, too.  heisa knowitall.  oh, my hair.  don't worry. my father already spilled about your bad piece, even if he didn'ttrust me, aliens could spot that thing from space.  kim. kim.  she's funnier without the pillow.  hoosha.  that's it. grab your coats.  we are leaving this instant.  dr. possible, see me in my office first thing tomorrow.  we need to discuss your future at the lab, or lack thereof.  wait. you can't do that.  it's not my dad's fault.  i got hit with a truth ray.  i'm sorry.  ha. truth ray.  absurd.  the board chairman.  now my career is completely over.  dr. wong.  kim. i can't thank you enough for your help today.  thanks to you, i narrowly escaped that nasty drakken and his truth ray.  there reallywasa truth ray.  i saved her. i save lots of people.  of course you do.  you were brilliant.  like daughter, like father, right doctors.  oh, of course.  i couldn't agree more.  it's an entire family of geniuses.  now, let's get inside and discuss your promotion, shall we.  ron: so everything worked out.  kim: totally. i apologized to the board members and, like, a zillion other people.  how about you.  i'm still mourning the loss of my truth mojo.  you could just be honest on your own.  believe me, i'm trying.  hi, ron.  hey, penny.  youyou have, you have the most, the most, um, you got the most cans in the school's charity can drive.  keep up the good work, tiger.  wait. i didn't hear any complaints from the cpr dummy.  captioned bymedia access group at wgbh  capt. barnacles: octonauts, to your stations.  kids: barnacles.  kwazii.  peso.  explore.  rescue.  protect.  kids: octonauts.  capt. barnacles: "the octonauts and the slime eels" kwazii: ahh. this spyglass is no good.  it's supposed to help me see things far away.  but i can't make out what that big shape is.  besides, we're so far down, it's dark as night.  good thing the octoscope can see in the dark.  can you give us a better picture of what's out there, dashi.  aye aye, captain.  it looks like a ship of some kind.   shiver me whiskers.  unless i miss me guess, that's the pirate shipwreck of calico jack himself.  both: calico who.  calico jack. he was me grandfather.  and the finest cat pirate ever to roam the 7 seas.  and he had a golden spyglass.  the spyglass was passed down from one member of me family to the next.  but before it could pass down to me, calico jack's ship sank in the north atlantic ocean.
