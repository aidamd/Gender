 ew. ew.  just a glitch.    ugh. ugh.  hey, kim, what's up.  know anything about everlot.  currently the fastest growing online multiplayer game around.  uses a fuzzy logic hierarchy modeled after...  nerd alert.  let's try that again.  do you now how to play it.  : affirmative.  ron said he'd meet zeta in everlot, but he's having trouble...   ...surviving.  don't open it. trade it with the dwarf.

elsinore with the aspen power wand of...  ..new forest and say the magic words.  and what are the magic words.   tre gouda makoideze.   we did it. coolio.   the wraith master.  sorry, dude, got to go.  wait. how did you escape.  maybe you haven't heard, but zeta and me...  yeah, we're sort of a team.  knave, you'll pay for your impudence.  wait. wait.  wade.  hit the ground with the power wand and say "bog open." bog open.  open. open. open.  no.  wraith masterno big.  a knave can't do that.  i'm no ordinary knave.  thou shalt pay for thy treachery, knave.  so tonight meet me in the glade of destiny.  or, you know, i know of this quaint little cafe.  in everlot.  in reality.  bueno nacho. uh, booya.  hi, malcolm. dude.  knave.   ron: that's cool when it's just us guys, but you know, clean up your act.  we're entertaining a lady.   hey, you don't tell him to cut out that gross stuff when i'm around.  what's your point.  never mind.  ronald, look, we've got little sombreros.  i'll never complain about space food again.  save me, please.  can't. meeting zeta.  excellent... for you.  check it outthey grande sized our beans.  we're going to make bean launchers.  out of sporks and bendy straws.  both: whosha.  zeta.  ron, i just got a text page.  there's this everlot thing downtown.  all the local power players are going to be there.  really. yeah. power players.  well, hey, what are we waiting for.  you can learn a ton at these things from other players.  well, not you. you already rock.  well, i don't know if i'd go so far as...  you know, rock.  um, who sent you this page.  yeah, this is freaky.  ron: good thing nobody else showed up.  there's only two chairs.   uh, what's that sound.  n.g. what's n.g..  not good.  wait. stop it.  hey, let go of...  : ...me.   yipe.   what happened.  let's seewe were downtown...  not anymore.  we're in everlot.    welcome to the game.  announcer:" the ultimate thrill ride through the world of disney.  it's a beautiful winter's day, and there's nothing like a little skiing.  oh, hey, buddy, watch out where you'reblam. going.  from this point on, it's all downhill.  ooh, talk about hitting the slopes.  well, i hope he's got a good dentist.  now let's rewind and check out where it all went wrong.  see, right here he's having a hard time seeing where he's going.  whoa, looks like somebody's a tree hugger.  he's wishing he stayed on the bunny slope.  he must be into yogathat's some downward facing dog.  would you like a little ice with your face.  let's try that again with something a little easier.  oh, yeah, a giant ski jump makes sense.  for some reason, he's looking way too confident, but i think he should call his mommy.  oh, yeah, i think he got it.  that looks right.  whoa. let's freeze that.  that's what i call freestyle skiing.  but seriously, this is like the longest ski jump ever.   so remember, don't try this at home, " warrior mountain, be my queen.  we will rule everlot together.  there you go.  ii hope you two will be happy together.  very funny.  sure. yeah, yeah, i'm a funny, funny knave.  zeforis, escape.  curses.    hmm.   wade, we've got a problem.  kim, you must be psychic.  i was just going to call.  we got a hit on the site.  tell them to take a number.  something's happened to ron.  how do you know.  rufus told me.   uh... at least i think that's what he's saying.  okay. i'll call back that guy at everlot, inc.   everlot, inc.. wait, isn't that....   i think rufus sees a connection.  apparently.  the missing project was next generation gaming technologya way to plug the five senses directly into the game world.  ouch.  not literally.  the player would just wear what we call an immersion cap.  slip it on and zap.  you're in everlot.  so it's like virtual reality.  more like actual reality, really.  it's not quite as real as reality, but we're really, really close.  really.  we'd be shipping them worldwide if it weren't for the problems.  what kind of problems.  well, it seems that once you're in the game, you can't get out until you win.  can't you just slip the cap off.  we tried that with him.  the little guy looks fine.   okay. thanks, mr. needius.  needius... any relation to malcolm needius.  yeah, my son, and everlot's number one fan.  wade, i know where to find ron.   okay, wade, ready.  ready. see you in cyberspace.  well, here we go.
