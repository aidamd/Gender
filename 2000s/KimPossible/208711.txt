moto x.  first things first, k.p.  rufus and i are gonna check out the action snacktion.  how's it rollin', ladies.  not even a glance.  is it that obvious i'm athletically lacking.  mmhmm. mmhmm.

to find this guy, ron, before he tries again.  chill, k.p. i'm still on the job.  these three are clean.  no 555 in sight.  well, that's the last of them.  whoa, ronwhat's with the fashion blindness.  pretty sweet, huh.  it's from my new sponsor.  hold upsomeone is actually giving you money to endorse their equipment.  not just equipmentminicorn dogs, too.  mmm. corn dogs.  kim, this jock thing is

size...  kim possible.  this one is on the house, of course.  this is so many levels of not right.  why, hello.  could it be that you cannot resist watching junior in a highaction competition.  competing.  you're an x gamer.  no way.  you're not even in the program.  i refuse to pose for the program photograph.  the lighting did not do me justice.  the two of you can consider yourselves busted.  busted. for selling tshirts and competing in the games.  we are just poor common folk now.  puhleese. don't even play that with me.  it's true. we lost all of our fortune.  and now what, you're trying to steal it back.  no. we are working hard to make an honest living.  you must understand.  money has no meaning to us.  now we're rich in moral fiber rather than material possessions.  come, i'll show you.  welcome to our paradise.  he went from owning his own private island to this.  the island was actually very impractical in the monsoon season.  with our new simplistic life, we want for nothing.  please, come in.  here are the vegetables we grow ourselves.  here is where junior spins the cotton fiber to make our clothing.  and here is where i collect the rainwater that we drink.  it is a simple life, but it is a good life.  and you don't miss being billionaire super villains at all.  i thought i might, but i do not.  would you like a cookie.  i churned the butter myself.  junior: none for me, father.  i am preparing for my big bike stunt competition.  well, i guess we better be getting back.  but, uh...  thanks for the tshirt.  i don't know, ron.  they actually seemed happy.  come on, k.p., how do you buy happiness without money.   hey, wade.  what up, kim.  you find our guy yet.  no love. anything on your end.  i found a connection between all of the robberies.  all of the companies hit are owned by one manvincent wheeler a.k.a. vinnie.  keep talking.  get thiswheeler was a financial advisor.  he got all his money by stealing it from his rich clients including...  the seniors.  bingo.  it is junior.  he's trying to steal back the family fortune.  the bike stunt expo.  oh. easy, ladies.  plenty of ron to go around.  here you go, man. time to rock and roll.  make us proud, bro.   oh, whoa. hey.  wait a sec.  it's time for the new sports exhibition.  are you amped..  what. wait. n... hold up.  a professional athlete needs his rest.  you know, get in the zone.  i'll be watching.  but, i...  can't....  junior, stop.   ooh, not pretty.   he's... he's terrible.   how did i score.  nice try, junior.  i know you're just tanking this event to try and throw me off.  throw you off what.  i've seen the tapes of the robberies, junior.  i know you've got procaliber x game skills.  i welcome that, and any other compliments you might have for me.  but i have no idea what you're talking about.  really.  then explain this.  oops.  why are you stretching out my jersey.  just making sure you didn't cover that tattoo with makeup or something.  ha. i never wear makeup.  well, perhaps a little foundation.  maybe some blush for ruddiness, but nothing on my neck, i assure you.  i don't understand.  look, all i want to do is make my father proud by winning a gold medal in the x games.  you might have your work cut out for you.  it's true. when it comes to action sports, i will never measure up to him.  to who. senior.  he has taught me everything i know.  he is an x games expert.  right. i'm sure he's the one with the 555 tattoo.  silly.  why would father have a 555 tattoo.  he already has the triples's.  what.  sss.  it stands for...  seor senior, sr.  yes. you finished my sentence.  wade, kim here.  i went after the wrong generation of senior.  kim, check this.  vinnie wheeler is flying out a shipment of uncut diamonds today right over the x games venue.  the sky surfing expo. thanks, wade.    sorry.  sorry. excuse me.  pardon me.  this'll just take a sec.  huh.  senior.  ah, kim possible.  did you not like the tshirt.  what about your new simple life.  what about wanting for nothing.  have you ever tasted homechurned butter.  it is quite revolting.  i'm probably going to regret this, but...  well, well, well...  hope you don't mind me dropping in.  oh. talk about unfriendly skies.    have a nice flight.   you should really consider qualifying for the x games, kim possible.  your moves are quite fresh.  how do you like this one.  i am only trying to get back what was taken from me.  not on my watch.    listen, billy, buddy, i want you to increase the reward money to two billion.  this is personal, baby.  i want this guy caught.   no date is worth this.  whoohoo.    hang on, rufus.  yeehaw.   oof.  a parachute would be nice right now.  or this will work.    again.  hey, how sick was that.  ugh, not even.  you were totally curved.  wait.  don't you want to interview me.  what. for shortest sports career ever.  let's go, mac.  hey, guys. any suggestions.  yep. retire, man.  you know, before you hurt someone.  starting with yourself, dude.   step aside, junior.  i cannot allow you to turn in my father.  oh, you can't.  no, because i am going to do it.  but why, junior, why.  to betray your own father.  father, please.  i'm turning you in for the reward.  reward. you mean cash.  crisp legal tender.  but of course.  i will use it to break you out of prison and buy back our island.  ah, an excellent plan.  after all, you cannot buy le goop hair care products with moral fiber.  you've done well, junior.  i am proud of you, my son.  hey, you want to move tables. it's kind of hot here.  no. no, umbrellas.  oh, or not.  i can't believe i got one day of jockdom like that.  it's like getting one bite of a queserito combo and then having the whole platter yanked away.  ron, let me spell this out for you.  girls like guys who are comfortable with who they are.  embrace your ronness and just stop trying to be something you're not.  you know something, kim, you might be right.  from now on, no more posing.  no more fronting.  i'm ron stoppable.  what you see is what you get.  and i'm not changing for anyone.  there you go.  excuse me, but... you're the guy who stopped that thief, right.  well, i...  we totally saw it on the big screen.  it was so badical.  you're, like, a hero.  remember: embrace the ronness.  listen, i don't know if "hero" would really be the right word to describe me. i...  i think "crusading crime fighter" might be a more accurate term.   captioned bymedia access group at wgbh  capt. barnacles: octonauts, to your stations.  kids:
