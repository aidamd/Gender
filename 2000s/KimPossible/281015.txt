mean, aren't there people who are trained to handle those hooligans.  yes, me.  i handle hooligans all the time.  it's what i do.  i know, dear.  you're a teen.  it's natural to want to rebel.  i am not rebelling.  i'm the opposite of rebelling.  i'm off to bed.  night, kimberly anne.  night, nana.  i know how nana can be, kimmie, but she means well.  she's just so, so... old.  it's like she's from another planet or something.  you know what might take your mind off things.  a good game of strategories.  strategories. strategories.  both: score.  i call the race car.  drakken: now that my signal has infected every mp3 player within a hundred miles, i shall activate the mind control and summon my army of spring breaking teens.  let me guess, that's just the beginning.  you will then...   i will then launch a satellite that will create a worldwide population of teen zombies.  and with them, i shall take over the world.    shego, remind me to order more fruity lickies as well.  shego: you're working with high confidence here, dr. d.  trust me, shego.  this plan is totally off the heezy.  beg pardon.  off the hook.  it's raw.  tookin'. chilly. poppin'. tight. mint.  it's very, very good, all right..  look, i need to beef up on my teen language skills if i'm going to kick it with my new army.  you aresohip.  word. now let's get this party started old school, yo.   i'll take science and nature for the block.  i'm going out for some air.  okay, mom.  shego: huh.  shouldn't generation y be here by now.  what's taking them so long.  yeah, maybe your plan wasn't quite as off the heezy as you thought.  shut.  i'm picking up movement.  they're coming.  behold my army of youth.   who are you.  your army reporting for duty.   this. this is your army of youth..  i think you missed by about 50 years, doc.  the signals must not have been properly tuned into the mp3 frequency.  but then what am i tapping into.  er, what say.  well done.  tapped into the hearing aid frequency, dr. d.  what am i supposed to do with an army of retired people.  ooh, lemon squares.  you can have them buy you discount tickets for the movies.  mmm, ah. these lemon squares are scrumpdillyishus.  you know what.  they're here, they're zombies.  might as well see what we can do with 'em.  : okay, follow me.  impressive. i wonder if they can sell ice cream.  kim, go wake nana so we can go out to breakfast.  can do.   hmm.  nana, we're going to breakfast.  it's a buffet.  nana. what.  oh, is that the remote for the tv.  silly me.  ron: thanks for bringing us here, doctors psquared.  this place rules so hard...  almost makes up for yesterday's spring breakage setback.  not having much luck with the whole fresh start.  you know, it's amazing.  in one short day, i managed to earn the sociallychallenged rep that took me a lifetime to cultivate back home.  rufus, on the other hand, was named honorary mascot of five different sororities.  mmhmm.   what do you got, wade.  a bunch of hightech robberies last night, all in your area.  hightech robberies.  naw, can't be.  not nana.  ron and i are on it, wade.  what are those.   knitting needles.   hmm.   hmm.  i don't know what it is, but we'll take some and get it analyzed.  bag it, rufus.  okay.  you're still planning to go through with your plan.  why not.  anyone could use an army of teens to take over the world.  it takes a true visionary to do it with an army of senior citizens.  i dare say my plan is more off the heezy than ever before.  if you say so.   it works. it works.   now we just need to complete the launch pad.  shego, my mature zombie army still has much to offer.  and there's no substitute for wisdom and experience.  life begins at 65, you know.  where are you getting this stuff, anyway.  read these brochures, shego.  they'll rock your world.  rufus, since you're, you know, chillin' down here if i hang out with you that makes me chill, too, right.  hmm. nope.  but you're still going to help me with the ladies, won't you.  i need to chill.  hmm.  perhaps a gigante naco might help make up your mind.  mmm. naco. mmm, okay.  wade, see if you can analyze this evidence.  kimberly ann, i'm very disappointed that you haven't taken my advice.  if you're looking for excitement why not ballroom dancing.  huh.  i'm going out for some air.    hey, the scan wasn't complete.  never mind, wade. i know what it is.  this is so wrong.  wade, got anything on an old deserted gator farm.  wade: checking.  drakken. my nana and drakken.  okay, we're over the weird limit here.   hey, wait.  way over the weird limit.   wade: kim.   kim. kim.  i'm switching to remote manual control.   gotcha.  well done, oldsters.  feeding time, kim possible.   they came with the lair.  isn't that great.   oh, my gosh.     hey, i'm ron.  and that's r to the o to the hizzy.  yup, yup.  gross.  oh, harsh.  that's l to the o to the hizzer.  oh, come on.  what about my clean slate.  wade: ron.  wade.  how did you find me.  d... did you have me microchipped or something.  uh, that's not important now.  drakken's got kim at a gator farm just north of chez leisure.  i'm on it, wade.  drakken: poor kim possible.  too bad you won't be around to see me control the minds of the world's elderly population.  which, by the way, is growing at 10% each year.  well, mystery signal solved.  indeed, we had a rough patch at the getgo, but i'm quite pleased with how it's worked out.  the rocket to carry my satellite into orbit is ready.  a little something i borrowed from the cape.  rufus, come on. hmm.  my fans.   ooh. an idea.  extra. ...party with rufus.  here, take a map.  drakken: five minutes to launch.  oh.  nana, it's me, kim.  kimberly ann.  uh, don't you want to, you know, lecture me or something.  wait.  that'skim possible's nana.   it's a zippetydodah day.  you know, you really should get that lemon square recipe from her.  they're to die for.  anyhoo, shego, feed the gators.       drakken: no, shego.  thisis a family matter.  nana, destroy little kimberly ann possible.  that's really low.  you know i can't hit my own grandmother.  oh, don't worry.  she'll be hittingyou.  as if.  when your nana was your age, she trained with the shaolin monks to perfect the ancient art of painlanechung kung fu.  hold up.  are you telling me that nana, my nana, is some kind of...     she then became a top aviatrix and was the first woman to successfully complete the navy's underwater demolition training program. nana.  you really don't know very much about her, do you.    drakken: your nana is a bad grandmother... shut your mouth.  i'm just talking about nana.  it runs in the family.   no.  the mind control signal.  hmm.  oh, where... where are we.  what am i doing here.  kimberly.  i'll explain it all to you later, nana.  we're in the evil lair of dr. drakken.  evil lair.  you haven't gone and gotten yourself in some kind of danger, have you, dear.  oh, she's in danger, all right.  you'll have to go through me first.  man: you'll have to go through all of us, missy.     ha. 200 points.  can't we talk this over.  not in the face.   ooh, gross.  shego.  you're too late.  nothing can stop me now.  man: party.   oh, snack.  let's get it jumpin' in here, y'all.  okay.  ron stoppable in thehouse.  whoo.  ron stoppable off the heezy.  i'm it. i'm chillin'.  do the robot. do the

kimberly ann, get your head in the game.  huh, nice moves, nana.  how about two out of three.  time to hit the highway, kim.  oh, thank you for rescuing us, dear.  i'm so proud of you.  not as proud as i am of you, nana.   wade, what's the sitch.  a group of giant mutant spiders are threatening a village in guam.  saddle up, boys.  we're off.  bye. i'll catch you guys back home.  if you're going to guam, you'll need to wear extra sunscreen.  i was stationed there in '62.  now...  captioning sponsored by theu.s. department of education andabc cable networks group captioned bymedia access group
