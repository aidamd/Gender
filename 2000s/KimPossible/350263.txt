 kim: keep it moving.  use both sides of your feet.  here, i'll show you.  is she scaring you too.  oh, yeah. uh, mmm, uhhuh.  i am so glad i'm just the equipment...  kim: equipment manager.   blow these up. hurry.      i wasn't ready. do over.  there are no doovers in a real game.   come on. hustle.   whoa.     ugh... whoa... huh...  kim: heads up.  survey the field.  keep the ball moving.   what's the sitch, wade.  how's the coach thing going.  getting there.  visualize goals.  visualize... senor senior, senior.  : what did you say.  triple "s" has struck again.  listen up, team.  i've got to jet.   it's that kind of attitude that says extra header practice.  now remember, hustle.  i'll be back as soon as i can.   that's not hustle.  woman: our company has invented a revolutionary new gas that burns 100 times brighter than neon.  doesn't look so bright to me.     yes, it's quite bright, isn't it.  not as bright as the stolen prototypes but very bright all the same.  now, what makes you think senor senior stole it.  they left this.  good day.  unless you're watching this after dark in which case, good evening.  so junior.  you are no doubt wondering why we have taken your super neon...  what are you doing.  a video calling card.  it will be my villainous trademark.  ow.  have you studied villainy at all, junior.  father...   what do you make of it.  family issues.  ron: my eyes.   how's it going, kimmie.  okay. usual villain stuff.  i meant the soccer practice.  uhoh.   okay, team.  that should be about enough.    same time tomorrow.  oh, my legs hurt.  i can't even feel mylegs.  so, how are my star players.  you two better get a good night's sleep.  tomorrow we gofullcontact.  isn't soccer pretty muchnocontact.  that's what the other teams think.  you get one chimirito and they give you, like a dozen little packets of diablo sauce.  you can't possibly use all this sauce.  somewhere, there's a landfill loaded with unopened hot sauce.  and someday, i'm going to find it.  you know, if i put on the uniform i could pass as a tall tenyearold.  what do you think.   i think it's just a game and your natural competitive kimness has taken you to a very dark place.  the team needs an edge.  you're the coach.  i'm a handson coach.  handson soccer.  interesting.   wade, do you think it's wrong to try to pitch in to help my team.  like fundraising.  like playing forward.  then i'd have to say yes.  so, what's the sitch.  watch this: junior calls it his video calling card.   you love the nightlife.  love to boogie.  then come on over to club lair the globe's newest and hottest disco.  hmm... he loves the camera.  and the camera loves him.  club lair is conveniently located in europe.  drive a little, party a lot.  well, they shouldn't be hard to find.  yeah, the map helps.  hmm.  what.  i did not say a thing.  you did. you said, "hmm." i did not mean to say, "hmm." it is your evil disco, not mine.  good. now, ready...  steady...  go.    let's dance    everybody, come and dance now   yes, yes.  very nice, but where is the villainy.  father, please.  i want to do this on my own.   kim: thanks for the ride, mr. blumberg.  i owe you one, kim.  i never would have gotten around the world in 80 days if you hadn't have saved me from that hurricane.  anyone could have steered a hot air balloon through galeforce winds.  i'm just glad ron was around to serve as a ballast.  this time i'm staying insidethe basket.   oh, yeah.  i hope this doesn't take too long.  i promised the team i'd do some power drills today.  power drills.  that sounds harsh.  hey, no pain, no gain.  hmm.  hmm.  kim, the team wanted me to talk to you about your...  coaching technique.  what about my coaching technique.  too much technique, not enough coach.  what's that supposed to mean.  they just want to have fun, kim.  winningisfun, ron.  see, that's your kimness talking.  well iamkim.  it's just a game...  with small children...  who cry when they see you coming.  fine. we'll let the team decide when we get back.  mr. blumberg: going down.  so, you taught the animals to chachacha.  now, tell me your villainous scheme.  my plan is this: as the funny animals dance to the pounding beat the crowd will be inspired to do the same.  and then.  we will party all night long.  everyone will dance.  thatis your evil plan.  and...  i will overcharge for beverages.   kim: sorry to break up the party seor seniors.  ron: what have that done to pizzapotamus.  and where's j.p. barrymore's banjo.  junior: i am so sorry but tonight is my grand opening.  it will be most inconvenient to give up now.  did you see the thing with the eyebrow.  nice touch, no.  uh, k.p., other than wrapping pizzapotamus in polyester this doesn't seem very evil.  see.  what did i tell you.  i'm sorry, my friends but this nightclub is rather exclusive and you're not on the guest list.  ah, the clever threat.  good, junior.  now, you must follow through with the display of violent anger.  but i'm mildly put off at best.  just throw something.  but father, i just had my nails buffed for the gala opening.   junior, this is not a party.  this is not a disco.  this is not fooling around.  sunglasses indoors.  how stylish.   oh, man.  huh.   no longer will you interfere, kim possible.  now, you are under my control.  junior, now is the time.  what.  the villainous laugh, junior.  but now i don't feel like laughing.  laugh.   ah, i've heard worse.    let's dance   what have you done, father.  the intense light of the super neon is refracted into an hypnotic pattern by the modified disco ball.  : you modified my disco ball.  but now they're standing still.  everyone must dance.    let's party, come and dance now   gotta dance.  can't stop dancing.  oh, let's boogie. oh, yeah.  did i not mention that the hypnotic victim responds to the first suggestion given.  they dance well for hypnotized people.  junior, now is not the time.  europe's elite will be here in a few hours.  yes.  to get down with our bad selves.  no.  to be hypnotized pawns in our plan to take over everything.  but that is notmyplan.  it is now.    ready.  whatever.  this is no longer my party.  junior, you can party all you want when we control everything.  i don't want to control.  i just want to...  no. do no speak the "d" word.  ambassador, so pleased you could make it.   come on, yeah, get on down   :  ooh, ooh   crowd is starting to perk up.  not for long.    ooh, yeah    oh, yeah    get on down    hey... yeah     hello europe.  this is seor senior, senior.  i am in command of a disco filled with fabulous vips.  can you speak up, sir.  the music is awfully loud.  in exchange for these very important persons i demand that you name me king.  king of everything.  i'm going to have to have someone get back to you on this.   wade: kim.  kim..    can't talk. dancing.  oh, my gosh.    a hypnotic disco ball.  help.  help is on the way, rufus.   hey... yeah   oh, man.  now.  oh.  hmm.  you rock, wade.   aget, aget, aget down   let's get this blackmail over with so that party can start.  patience my son.  we are on the verge of being royalty.  fine. whatever.  then we can all...  don't say it.  sorry, seniors.  cancel the coronation.  senior senior: ah kim possible.  you are so resourceful.  unlikesomepeople i could mention.  always the putdowns, but where is the praise.  where, father.  now is not the time, junior.  senior, senior sounds like a certain soccer coach i know.  mmhmm.  oh, does he have too much kimness now, too.  not exactly.  he's just a control freak.  you're...  well, yeah, you are like...  wow, that's weird.  you know, kim possible the disco ball is not the only thing i modified.     dance    got to kick it, got to kick it   j.p. barrymore's gone rogue.  first they take his banjo. now this.  attack, my robotic animal pawns.   got to kick it, got to kick it    got to kick it    give it up, huh   not pizzapotamus.  ron, we can't let those innocent people get hurt.  not to mentionus innocent people.  wade, can you hack into the system controlling the animals.  kim, it's the most sophisticated computer system i've ever seen.  it's a banjoplaying bear.  he took his banjo.  i can't hack the bear. let me try the beaver.  father has made my party a major drag.  everybody, dance.    let's dance   junior, what have you done.   i'm in.   let's party, come and dance now   kim, i took out the otter and the beaver.  sweet, wade.  kim.  help.  bear, bear, bear.   come and dance now    let's party, come and dance now     let's party, come and dance now   i'll be right down.  no, coach possible.  this is my ball.   let's party, come and dance now    let's dance     goal.   this is the last time i let you run the show.  if you had let run it none of this would have happened.  nice hustle.    i hate it when they get away.   let's go.  i've got to do some handsoff coaching.  good shot.  next time try for the other team's goal.  both: you got it.  the important thing is that they're having fun.  i'm glad you see that now.  whatever.  kimmie, you better perk up.  you're the coach.  not anymore, dr. p.  while kim was learning to let go the team let her go.  who's coaching then.  the guy with the banjo.  way to go, team.  kick that ball. way to go.  captioning sponsored by theu.s. department of education anddisney

only one will be crowned the nonloser.  first up, crowd favorite, agent k.  crowd favorite.  she needs to ricochet through the asteroid field, past the black holes, between the planets and through the sun to hit a hole in one.  ha. that's what they'd expect me to do.  oh, an extremely creative effort gone horribly, horribly wrong.  ohh, this round to you, gravity.  next up, dick daring.   the only golfer whose score so far is higher than his iq.  thanks. hmm.  i think i'll use my putter.    look out in the hole.  ooh, almost, dad.  you would have made it except for pluto.  pluto. that's not even a real planet anymore.  i am playing this round under protest.  unless i win.  and then it counts.  ok, for the win and the crown.  let's see, um, i'll just whack it over there.  dink, dank, doonk, woogawoogawooga, swoosh, paplunk.  no problem.  dink, dankdoonk, woogawoogawooga, swoosh...  hey, where's my paplunk.  oh, that's got to hurt.  so close and yet so far.  a lifetime of failure about to be washed away with a single stroke...  ok, i get it.  and now riley daring one stroke away from snatching the crown away from her brother.  but what's this.  she's turning around and aiming for the milky way ramp.  she can't get a hole in one going that way.  riley, you can't get a hole in one goin' that way.  she's playing it safe, as usual.  but what about our family motto.  "don't play it safe".  hmm, catchy.  hahaha.   you ended up on the wrong side of the himalayas.  you're done.  who cares.  it's not like we're playing for a real crown.   huh.  there's a real crown.  if i'd known that, i would've played differently.  oh, please, you would not.  i might have.  absolutely not.  allow me to demonstrate.  in one hand, i have a $5 bill.  in the other, i have an electric joy buzzer.  will you risk getting zapped for a chance at $5.  let's see. i could use $5, but how bad is the shock, and for how long.  gimme my money.  aah.  if i had shoulders, i would shrug as i say, "see." give... ow.  ...me... ow.  ...my... ooh.  ...money. owow.   huzzah.  steak tartare.  mom, i don't think the recipe calls for actual tar.  really.  heeey.   dig in, everyone.   i'll get it.  hello.  who is this. hello.  hello. fleemco.  hello, todd, hello, riley.  conrad fleem here.  you're callingus.  whoa, that's a first.  yes.  i need a favor.  i need you to replace somebody for me.  whoa. this is totally backwards.  it's unprecedented.  it's mindblowing.  do we get paid.  let me explain.  my aerospace division, fleemstar, is about to launch its first private space tourism flight.  cool.  you betcha.  hahaha.  however, my customers for the first flight have expressed some concerns about safety.  ooh, but if something goes wrong and i'm stranded in space, how will i spend all my money.   so i was hoping that the daring family would volunteer to replace them for the first flight.  it would be sort of a test flight to show how easy and safe it probably is.  did you say "probably".  can we go. can we go.  can we go. can we go.  well, i could get some highaltitude surveillance done.  two words zerogravity stunts.  yaah.  and i suppose we could get a sitter for riley.  what.  oh, honey, she's old enough to stay home by herself.  that's not what i meant.  why am i staying behind.  it's a test flight.  what part of not being a risktaker didn't you get.  oh, that's it.  this family is going into space all of us.  i'll show you a thing or two about taking risks.  i can be as big of a risktaker as any of you.   i just choose not to.  just because a person likes to think before she acts doesn't mean she isn't adventurous.  it doesn't mean she can't be impetuous.  i can be very wild.  i can go with the flow, so to speak.   battery check.  who cares if being an astronaut is four times as dangerous as being a lumberjack.  i'm going to show you you don't know riley daring.  i am going to throw caution to the to the wind.  safety first. ha.  i say safety ninth.  ok, then.  i'm starting the car.   i'm putting it in gear.  we're about to drive away...  aah. seat belts.  greetings, herr daringundfamily.   hey, it's that guy.  hans herkemer, my old stunt coordinator. hoho.   you work here now.  good to see you landed on your feet.  yes, you should try it sometime.  so, when do we meet our pilot.  he's right here.  where. him.  hey, that monkey stole my cell phone.  wait a second.  dad is our pilot.  yes, young lady.  in order to prove that our fleemstar shuttles are so safe, they are idiotproof...   well, you know.  where's the pilot.  hello, knockknock.  you are going to be ze pilot.  i'm gonna whose it in the what now.   don't vorry. we will put him through a rigorous astronaut training program.  undperhaps elementary school.   . this is my spacetraining montage . running for science . spinning in a thing ooh, this tickles.  . now i'm back running . funny things on me . hey, look at their stuff . man, they look hot . what's that guy doing during my montage.  . i'm eating small foods that expand in my tummy ooh. mmm.  uh, dad...  don't worry.  37th time is a charm.  but the landing gear...   )
