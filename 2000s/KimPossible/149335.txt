   the jade monkey.  whoa.  kim. huh.  what happened. kim possible i shall see to it that the national museum celebrates your heroic efforts.  it was no big.  i'm telling you, kim he's bad road.  i feel it.  he has a royal title.  which you can buy on the internet.  go to sleep.   there's a monkey in camp.  a live one.  you're obsessed. sleep.  getting closer.  a monkey.  ah. it's just a hooded ninja.  he's got the statue.  ron, catch.  don't worry, kim.  i've got the monkey.  i got the monkey.  hey.  oh, no.  he's gone and the statue's gone with him.  what's all this, then.  someone stole the jade monkey.  how shockingly awful.  yes, awfully shocking, milord.  word of our discovery must have gotten out.  oh, rot. if only your bravery was not wasted.  morning, honey.  how'd cambodia go.  mixed. the good parti rescued a priceless icon from a ferociously snaky, spiky pit.  less gooda ninja stole it.  isn't that just like those darn ninjas.  well, this ought to flip that frown upside down.  cousin larry felt so bad about missing you for game night aunt june invited us all over for dinner saturday.   oh, i... i wouldn't want to impose.  not at all.  june says larry never has friends over.  maybe because he's the dweebiest guy on the planet.  jim... don't mock family.  maybe he's not even of this world.  maybe he comes from some faroff planet of dweebs.  take a lesson from your sister, boys.  larry might not look like the coolest kid around but kim knows that you can't judge a book by its coverright, honey.  huh.   saturday is going to be "night of the living larry." you know, i got to tell you...  this larry, he sounds like a majorly fun guy.  majorly fun.  want me to send him to your house.   go, wade.  kim, i dug up some info on that jade monkey.   lalalala, monkey stuff    get in the monkey stuff, lala...   please continue, wade.  the temple was one of four built by the followers of monkey kung fu.  each temple had a jade monkey.  back up. what is monkey kung fu.  other than sick and wrong.  according to legend when the four jade monkeys were brought together they gave the warriors mystical monkey power.  it's the same drawing we saw at the dig.  but why separate the monkeys.  because mystical monkey power is sick and wrong.  actually, the legend says that the warriors didn't want anybody else to get the power.  maybe the thief believed the legend.  fisk: bates. bates.  coming, milord.  you know, milord i do wonder if it might have been a mistake to call in kim possible.  nonsense.  the plan worked perfectly.  she retrieved the item, didn't she.  milord could have handled those primitive booby traps.   and risk injuring these hands..  besides...  by masquerading as the ninja, i threw suspicion off me.  you know best, of course, milord.  and now destiny awaits.  while at last i have all four monkeys.   stunning in its monkeyocity.  it is magnificent.  and now mystical monkey power shall be mine.  you mean that figuratively, of course, milord.  what's that, bates.  uh, well, to truly believe that old myth would be crazy.  crazy, you say.  like it was crazy to spend the family fortune on radical genetic mutation and dangerous experimental surgery.  like it was crazy to become a manmonkey who violates every law of nature and science..  it's a touch unconventional.  now, put the magic monkey in place.  the leading expert on all things simian is lord monty fisk.  we helped him, he'll help us.  we'll go talk to him this weekend.  oh, that'll be a fun conversation.  monkey this, monkey that... monkey, monkey, monkey.  ron, look... oh, saturday...  just remembered my dinner with larry.  can't you flake. no.  all flaking options denied.  can i make a suggestion.  send me.  oh, no.  which one's the real kim.  what do you think.  oh, sure, make fun.  but when holographic duplicates start running around you can't be too careful.  think about it, kim.  my holographic simulator's ready for a field test.  really, larry.  that's very interesting, larry.  nice costume, larry.  it rocks, wade, but i can't do the virtual flake.  i promised dad.  it is very tempting though.  so, what made you decide to do the virtual flake after all.  wade really wanted to test out the holokim.   are we going to ring the doorbell.  knock. something.  uh, yeah, doorbell.   mmm.   kim possible.  nice to see you again, bates.  we just had a few questions for lord monty fisk.  i shall announce your presence.  larry: greetings, kim. i am othar.  maybe you recognize me fromreturn to ios.  hello, larry.  i do not know this larry of whom you speak.  i am othar.  you really don't get the spirit of roleplaying, do you, cousin.  as you can see my ios collection has grown quite impressively since your last visit.  notice anything amiss.  uhuh.  uh, it's a burnola senator with a silver cape.  rather dramatic error on the part of the manufacturer given that the senators wore only purple.  really, larry. isn't that fascinating.  can i interest you in a game of fortress.  i can cheat code us right to level nine.   mmmonkeys.  wait up.  kim possible, and your monkeyphobic friend.  how delightful.  sorry to bother you, lord fisk but we wanted to ask you some questions about...  so, you know all about it.  about my obsession with taishing piqua.  say again.  oh, we're playing stupid i see.  taishing piqua.  monkey kung fu.   is it just me or is he walking funny.   but did you know that i spent the family fortune to get these.   and these.  bad road, bad road, bad road.    bow to my power.  i am monkey fist.  so, now you know my secret which you will take to your graves.  how can you be so sure.  i mean, a lot can happen in the next 60 or 70 years.   ohgot you.   she is good.  you're the holokim.  what. then where is the real kim possible.  mmm.  is that real timestreaming video.  yeah. annoying channel documentary.  i'm sureyouwouldn't be interested.  au contraire.  long have i followed the career of lord monty fisk.  a littleknown fact: he is a master of taishing piqua.  what.  monkey kung fu.  monkey kung fu.  he was the ninja.  oh, can you play games with this.  ron was right. he is bad road.  hello. awaiting. do you read me.  give me that.  and so, monkey hater, we meet again.   sedentary time.  it's time to center.  bates: monkey kung fu is half mental.  completely mental in this case.   now then, where were we.  he's escaped, milord.  after him.  wade...  lord monty fisk stole that icon.  i think he believes in mystical monkey power.  wade: it's worse.  he has the power.  and now he calls himself monkey fist.  and do you know that how.  ron's in his house right now.  why did he go there alone.  he didn't exactly.  you're with him... sort of.  the holokim.   ron...  kim, tell me you're real.  i wish. wade got carried away with his new dead end.  oh, man.  there's a window.  give me a boost.  uh, ron... i'm not really here, you know.  right.  huh.  this will work.  you can't leave now.   monkey.  i don't know what to do.  if i were there, i could help him, but...  give it to me. i have an idea.  this isn't one of your stupid science fiction games, larry.  ron's facing a kung fu mutant with bioengineered hands and mystical monkey powers.  and...  here.  huh. who are you.  kim's cousin larry.  but that's not important.  i will no longer be distracted by holograms.  prepare for pain.  remember level nine of fortress.  to defeat the cloud guardian you must drink from his enchanted well.  that's supposed to help.  it's a geek thing.  i must become that which i fear most.  hey, monkeys.  hit me.   oh, yeah, i'm feeling it.  yay.  no. mystical monkey power is reserved for me and me alone.  i must disagree.     coochiecoochiecoo.    away with you, vile rodent.   ooh.  oh...   oh... pain.   mystical power or not you have no chance against a master of monkey kung fu.  that's why i'm pulling the plug.  rufus, search and destroy.   no.  you'll ruin everything.  that's quite enough.  stop it this very instant.  i insist.   i saved them all.  mystical monkey power will still be mine.  monkey this, you hairy freak.    and the rebellion on burnalis was given such a passing mention in the film i wrote my own story about the battle.  you can imagine the debates that raged when i posted it on the fan site, kim.  really.  i'm not boring you, am i.  no, no, no, go on, please.  this is fascinating stuff.  hey, want to see out takes frommoon beyond ios.  the deleted footage of the shrieker race.  i got it at the '99 tulsa convention.  score.  u guys are the greatest.  when the chips were down you both came through.  i'm really proud.  so you going to watch with us.  not even a chance.  later, guys.  ron: what. this is cool stuff, kim. kim.  captioning sponsored by theu.s. department of education anddisney channel captioned bymedia access group at wgbh captioning made possible byabc cable networks group  todd and
