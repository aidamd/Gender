 ratings are up.  merchandise sales are up.  mmhmm. copycat instances are up, too.  it means they're watching.  not fault if the little dweebs aren't careful.  maybe they don't get it that you fake the stunts.  whatever. the point is, if we're going to stay on top the next stunt has to be bigger.  more extreme.  like what.  i'm thinking, bungee.  freaky.  kim: i'm not so different from anyone else.  except that, you know, i have an arch foe or two.  nah.  you're right.  after watching adrena lynn wrestle a bear kim kind of pails in comparison.   sure, i'm busy, but what teenage girl isn't.  boring. mmhmm.  where's the angle.  it feels good to help people.    we have an awesome team this year.  brick flagg was totally hot in last week's game.  hmm.  hmm.  brick flagg was totally hot...  hmm.  totally hot. hmm.  totally hot. hmm.  totally hot.  houston, the angle has landed.  uhuhah.  whoa.   kim, i think it is so great what you did.  which was.  i mean, to risk utter embarrassment and total rejection like that.  : by ron stoppable.  we'll totally be here for you when he dumps you.  so, kim, you think i'm hot.  actually, what i think i said was...  cool. what are you doing friday night.  well, nothing.  i mean... i mean nothing with you.  pick you up 8:00.  oh, i, um, uh...  hey, she thinks i'm hot.   so, i think brick flagg is hot.  it's true.  she just said it herself.  did you see it.  my name in lights.  well, in ink actually but still.  ron, you ferociously misquoted me.  whoa.  i may have done a tiny bit of rephrasing, but come on.  you'd think a crimefighting cheerleader would give a more interesting interview.  the paper liked my story so much they're giving me a column.  uh, i'll have an omelet.  whites only.  she must not know who i am.  i'm not sureiknow who you are.  so, i'm thinking i should cover the big date with the brickster.  what time should i be ready.  ron... you're sitting with us.  i'm having a little get together tonight.  no biggie.  just 50 of my closest friends.  youhaveto do a writeup for the paper.  i do.  how else will the social outcasts know what they've missed.  you could invite them to...   you areso funny.  check you later, k.p.  duty calls.    hey, kim.  nice, uh, lunch.  um, thanks.  listen, i'm glad you're here.   i'm glad i'm here, too.  no, no, no, no.  ii mean, about friday night.  uh, i'm just not sure if...  if we should do dinner or a movie.  i had the same debate.  but then it hit me.  hot dogs at the theater.    save me.  kim.  hey, you're kim's computer dude.  and you're that "kim thinks you're hot" dude.  yeah, yeah. that's me.  excuse me.  uh, brick, i have to... go.  see you friday.  he seems nice.  okay. spit it out, "computer dude." hey, you got an im.  pop pop porter, the frozen food kinghe needs your help.  apparently, he's been robbed.  i smell a scoop.  hey.  what was stolen.  my pop popcorn shrimp.  pop pop, you brought us out here because someone stole a crustacean.  i don't get it.  my shrimp force one was my favorite.  : my favorite.  a blimp.  should be easy enough to spot.  wade, do a search of ufo sites.  what am i looking for.  anything about earth being invaded by giant sea creatures.  let's see.  giant pig in belize.  pterodactyls in pittsburgh.  wait. i got it.  "giant shrimp attacks...  new york city."  on target, kim.  i'm tracking the blimp to just around the corner.   male : what.  what.  i know that voice.  adrena lynn.  what... .  crowd: will she do next..  what a story.  adrena lynn is real hero.  ron, she stole that blimp.  this is art, k.p.  sacrifices must be made.  adrena lynn: tonight i will attempt the ultimate in extreme action.  i will bungee jump from this blimp.  crowd: ooh.  blindfolded.  freaky.  crowd: oh.   got ya.  huh.  okay, that's really annoying.  lynn: freaky.  man: she's okay.   she made it.  rufus, my friend guess who got a front page photo.  you.  man: how does she do it.  ron: oh, no.  it can't be.  it was just a dummy.  she didn't even fall.  ron, get over it already.  sorry, k.p., but discovering that your action hero is a big fake is not something you just get over.  and this from a wrestling fan.  i don't get the connection.  looks like pop pop porter got so much publicity he's no pressing charges for the blimp theft.  so she's getting away with it..  well, i was able to highlight the key areas on that photo file.  she calls herself extreme.  the big fake.  imagine that.  lying to the public just to build up your own reputation.  disgusting.  well, adrena lynn might get a pass from pop pop but ron stoppable smells a story.  and in our top story, ron stoppable of the middleton high newspaper reports that extreme teen, adrena lynn, is an extreme fake.  i'm in the paper, too.  i'm national, baby.  "ace reporter, ron stoppable "heralded for breaking the story of tv fake.  adrena lynn's ratings plummet faster than her fake fall." can this get any more annoying.   what up, wade.  it's your brothers.  you were doing what..  bungee jumping out of a blimp.  like adrena lynn.  only we didn't have a blimp so we used the roof.  and we didn't have a bungee cord so we used yarn.  that adrena lynn is a menace.  and she didn't really bungee jump out of a blimp.  don't you boys watch the news.  nah, the only show we watch is adrena lynn.  hey, it's time.  and reports that adrena lynn is a fake coupled with a rash of copycat stunts across the country...  that's us.  ow.  ...has prompted this network to cancel adrena lynn in favor of more responsible programming.  so, stay tuned for an extra hour ofstuff on fire.  excellent.  now i can focus on the looming disaster in my social life.  hip to the left hip to the right spin and slide who's going to win against eastside.  who. who.  ron: looking good, k.p.  oh, don't worry, baby i'm not going to forget about the little people who got me where i am today.  i'll be there friday night to cover your date with brick.  : yeah.  cool. our date's going to be like newsworthy.   brick, wait.  we need to talk.  did you just say, "we need to talk".  that's exactly what amelia said last year when she dumped me.  i mean, when we, you know, broke up.  well, you can't really call it breaking up if we haven't even...  i was a wreck.  i totally blew it in the big game against eastside.  so, what did you want to talk to me about.  just that... i can't wait for friday either.  cool.  i am so toast.    she is so toast.  roll the camera.  hello, lynn.  we've been canceled.  we're not canceled until i say we're canceled.  a lonely highway.  a desperate mission.  tonight, i will pull my greatest stunt yetrevenge against kim possible and ron stoppable.  how's that for a teaser.  good.  it'd be better if we had an audience.  oh, we will.     hello.  wade: kim, wade.  sorry to use a landline but the communicator satellite is down.  what's the sitch.  it's not just the communicator.  video signals all over the world are getting messed up.  father: darn tv.  tim: whack it again, dad.  you have to make it work.  what good is having a broken leg if you can't sit and watch tv all day.  maybe this is a good thing.  we can have some quality family time.  somet.  well, i could put it in geosynchronous orbit but i'm not sure how that would help.  oh, kimmie, your boyfriend called while you were out.  he's not my boyfriend.  that's not what ron said on the ron report.   is something wrong, honey.  you have our undivided attention.  the tv's broken.  ron made up a story about me liking the quarterback and now i'm stuck dating him or we'll lose the big game.  meanwhile, there's a worldwide satellite crisis.  kimmie, you have to be honest with brick.  if the football team loses, it's not your fault.  i can't help you with the satellite thing.  uh, i don't think you have to worry about dating brick tonight.  hey, i thought you said kim wanted to meet me here.  uh, she'll be here.  adrena lynn. adrena lynn.  hmm. i thought she was canceled.  well, i think we know who's jamming the satellite transmissions.  wade.  tonight, ron stoppable kim possible versusmein extreme combat.  and to raise the stakes, i have kim's boyfriend.  he is not my boyfriend.    don't worry i'm going.   hey surfers, we're going behind the scenes  of the latest disney movie.  .movie surfers.  hey surfers, welcome to new orleans.  that's right, it's where the new animated adventure the princess and the frog comes alive.  you will enjoy. i guarantee.  so why set the movie here.   well the animators needed a city where alligators love jazz.  .jazz trumpet.   humans get transformed into frogs.  that's new.  and magical adventures might be waiting just around the corner.  new orleans is a wonderful city.   it was a city that lent itself to the magic and the mystery  and the music that we wanted to incorporate.   which is perfect for telling a fairy tale story.  it's beautiful, no.  there's no other place like new orleans.   wow, it's wonderful.  new orleans is also the home of mardis gras.   and elaborate costume balls.   it's a city where anything can happen.  and the food is amazing.  order up.  what just happened.  which makes this city perfect for tiana, the movies hard working heroine.  the princess's ultimate goal is to have her own restaurant.   but she wants to do it her way, and on her terms.  .i'm almost there.  her philosophy is you gotta make your own fairytales come true.   certainly, she's not a character who's waiting  for a prince to rescue her.  so when prince naveen comes around it leads to a whole lot of things that she didn't expect.  you must kiss me.  excuse me.  please, it will make me human.  just one kiss.  unless you beg for more.   so one little tiny kissleads to one masisve adventure.  what did you do to me.   they end up going on a journey together.   it's so much fun.  i could use a little help.  oh, i will play a little louder.  where y'all going.  find someone to break this spell.  the only thing important is what's under the skin.  the princess is what you have inside.  and you can do anything that you set your mind to.   whatever it is that makes your pulse race faster.  go for it.  yeah, you know it.   well surfers, that's just a taste of new orleans and  disney's the princess and the frog  in theaters now.  ron: kim, the only thing down this road is the old middleton fairgrounds.  that, and adrena lynn.  that place is haunted.  plus, i lost, like, ten bucks trying to win a stuffed hippo.  too bad, ron.  if it weren't for you and your stories we wouldn't be here.  this place gives me the creeps.    creepy.    aah. aah.   lynn: high school quarterback brick flag takes the ride of his life and only one person can save him.  his beloved girlfriend kim possible.  and me.  drop the dramatics, adrena lynn.  this isn't a game.  exactly.  it's real, it's extreme and it'sfreaky....  clock's ticking.  come on, ron.  whoa. whoa.  whoa.... whoa....  lynn: freaky.     gee, i wonder how the quarterback is doing.       look out, ron.    playing games when poor brick is hurdling towards his doom.  what kind of girlfriend are you.  that girl doesn't play fair.  come on, kimmie.  show 'em what you got.  go get her, adrena lynn.  jim, tim, there will be no rooting for your sister's foe.    ron: kim.   no, please.  this ride always makes me throw up.  ron: hey....  kim.  kim.  kim.     lynn: ooh, that move's going to cost you.  hey. the quarterback's almost out of time and going the wrong way.  adrena lynn, you cannot do this.  and why not.  i'm the one responsible for you being canceled.  i called you a fake.  what.  i guess it takes one to know one.  i made up that stuff about kim liking brick just to sell my story.  oh, harsh.  it worked, kind of.  but the thing is if the fake part about you is what people like well, what good is that.  you're right.  from now on, i'm keeping it real. me, too.  starting with my very real defeatof kim possible.   okay, that didn't work.  let's see.  kim: what will i do next.  uh, i do extreme stunts for a living.  : you think i'm afraid of heights.  you fake extreme stunts.  let the world see how brave you are when there's real danger.  not so extreme after all, now, are you.  are you.  no.  both: now she tells us.   listen, i'm sorry you almost plunged to your death on worldwide television...  kim, stop.  i get it now.  you do.  sure.  you had that skinny guy expose adrena lynn so she'd freak out and set up this whole "save brick" thing just to prove you dug me.  and all but you try too hard.  if you'd just ask me out, that's cool, but this is too much.  i'm sorry, but it's over.  i can't believe it.  i know.  headline: "quarterback sacks kim possible.  "she has a dislocated heart and will be out for the remainder of the season."  thank you.  mmhmm.  i'm number one. i'm number one.  yeah, you may wanna get that finger looked at.  ..  foamy.  theme music.  . he's on his way to the throne .  . hool .  . he's got to ace that test .  . he's an emperortobe .  . and he's totally.  you know, it's all about me.  . exactly .  . let's go .  . he's goin' to kuzco academy .  . kuzco academy .  . he's got to learn his abcs .  . don't try to stop him, to top him .  to destroy him, right.  ..  . kuzco .  . kuzco, kuzco, go, go .  . he's got the cool .  . he's got the charm and the looks .  . and a hottie than can help him .  . read that thing called book .  . let's go .  . he's goin' to kuzco academy .  . come on, kuzco .  . he's go . his friends are loyal .  . it's royal, they'll help against the foil.  friends. i thought this was all about me.  heh heh. spell my name again.  . kuzco .  . kuzco, kuzco, go, go .  captioning made possible bydisneyabc cable networks group this is odd.   ooh. i hear cheering.  maybe it's a surprise kuzco rally.   well, never understood the point ..   the object of your affection is here.   we're not cheering for you.  we're cheering for him.   yay. yay. victor e. llama. whoo.  hello. you're cheering for a big, ugly poodle.  what is with you peopuhh.    oh, are you ok, sir.  i don't get it, guaca.  why are these people cheering for something that's not me.  llama, the school's mascot.  ..  he's getting everybody pepped up for the big homecoming game against micchu pachu high.  hmm.  he marches out every time we score, motivating our kuzcoball team.  yeah, doesn't ring a bell.  haven't you seen everybody with their victor e. llama gear.  the pennants. the mudflaps.   so that's why my kuzco bling hasn't been selling.  get your kuzco junk free with any victor e. llama purchase.  kuzco, victor's everywhere.  haven't you ever been to a game, a pep rally, an assembly.  puhlease. what's the point.  to raise school spirit.  this is ridiculous.  i'm clearly better than some stupid poodle.  is it too much to ask that for once, the focus isn't entirely on you.  silly malina, asking questions you already know the answer to.  this school's only big enough for one of us, and i was here second.   kuzco has little rainbows on his underwears.   they're not rainbows.  they're rainbowcolored hearts.  i bought them for his birthday.   this year's homecoming game is also my high school's 30th reunion.  you mean 130th.  i'm 48, kronk.  in dog years.  i was the most beautiful girl in school.  ..  never mind that, because tomorrow i'll be crowned unnamed academy's most accomplished alum.  unnamed academy.  that's what we called kuzco academy before kuzco was born.  catchy.  and when i win, i'll shove that award in margo oneupher's ugly, blemishfree face.  margo oneupher. )
