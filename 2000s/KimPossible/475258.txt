something.  his whole story is ridiculous.  erichey, back off, pretty boy.   we're going behind the scenes of the latest disney movie.  . movie surfers .  surfers, everyone has a destiny.  and in the sorcerer's apprentice,  dave discovers his destiny isto take on the coolest job ever.   you are going to be a very important sorcerer,  but for now, you're my apprentice.  i'm a what.  and it's our destiny to go behind the scenes to get some surfer secrets.   first we caught up with producer jerry bruckheimer  to find out about shooting on location.  well it's based in new york, so you get to see a lot of the great sights of new york.   and so what our sorcerers do is take some of those icons,  and make them come alive.   so magic is all around you in new york.   so we traveled to the set ourselves,  and talked to stars, nicolas cage and jay baruchel.  so where we at right now.  we're in the training room.  this is called the merlin circle on the ground  and it lights up into fire.   the relationship between balthazar and dave is that  i try to bring the best out of him and get him to believe in himself.  and he's fighting it and fighting it, and then finally there's acceptance.  knuckle bump.  might as well.  he teaches me how to morphthings and go invisible, and throw plasma.  ow, ow, ow.   alongside him i will learn to become prepared  to save the world.  i did it.  my mother is definitely impressed.   i hear there's some unusual creatures in this movie.  we've got some of the world's coolest bad guys.  oh no.  hello dave.  hi.   and director john turteltaub gave us some insight  on the exciting car chase scene.  we said, "what would asorcerer car chase be like."  there's a lot of special effects in magic.   you know you're going to go and have a good time.  now surfers, just like magic, you can see more of the sorcerer's apprentice casting a spellover theaters now.   how'd you do that.  i'm a sorcerer.  well that's, new.  so it was definitely drakken.  voice print match confirms it.  got anything on ron's evil toy theory.  yeah, looks bad.  how bad. all bad.  i scanned the one i got in my little nios meal.  this circuitry is way beyond anything i've ever seen.  it's like a real robot, only tiny.  better show it to an expert.  who. my dad.  be back as fast as i can.  butit's a save the world thing.  dr. possible: i do not believe it.  what.  they're totally evil, right.  the cybertronic technologyit's the hephaestus project.  he used my invention to build these things.  you know, for an evil genius, drakken is pretty stupid.  he steals a $3 billion, supersecret technology and just gives it away with a burrito.  and yet he ditches the bendy straws.  this man does not know how to run a fast food business.    shego. status report.  shego: it's a mixed bag.  what.  on the positive side, global saturation has reached optimum level.  we can strike at midnight.  drakken:..  well, there's a snag.  ah, kim possible.  how'd you guess.  no, not this time.  we strike at the rest of the world at midnight as planned.  but i want middleton online now.  oh, and shego, i need you to run out and pick up something for me.  how'd it go down there.  that drakken fellow stole my technology to make those little diablos.  we're playing with stolen technology.  cool.  the craze is off the chain.  every kid on the planet must have one.  dad, you said the hephaestus projectit was some kind of living metal.  that's how we sold it to the board of directors.  the cybertronic circuitry can repair itself, modify itself.  it can actually grow.  heh heh. don't worry.  it can't do anything without a command signal.   whoa. move it.  ah.   get mom and the boys out of here.  we'll distract the diablos.  rufus, run.    dr. possible: head for the garage.  do you know how much babysitting i had to do to pay for this dress.  that would be so cool if it wasn't that last thing we were ever going to see.   dr. possible: kimmy needs help.  ok, we're talking about giant robots here.  giant cybertronic robots.  giant cybertronic robots armed with stateoftheart weapons.  aw, kim doesn't stand a chance.  boys, how many times have i told youanything's possible for a possible.  jim, tim, we need to borrow your rockets.  hey, this is the j200 rocket fuel i developed.  i wondered what happened to this, boys.  where's that help.  wade, we've got a big problem.   if it has anything to do with a giant robot, i think i can relate.  my dad says they need a command signal.  makes sense.  you take out the signal, you shut down the robots.  but i'm not really in a position to track the signal for you.  it must be coming from the source of all things evil.  pardon.  bueno nacho.  kimmy, think fast.  blast off. blast off.   how do we get the rockets to go faster.     look.  he even changed the giant taco sign.  ron, that's where the command signal's coming from.  how are we gonna take that out.  maybe we won't have to.   hey.  ron: lookin' the wrong way, dude.  aah.    wade, you're ok.  the diablo is shut down and shrunk down, thanks to you, i'm guessing.  i think we took out the mmand signal.  which sounds a lot like a good thing, right.  that's weird. just got a hit on the site.  congratulations, miss possible.  you have already discovered how to foil my evil scheme.  in record time, i might add.  it is most unfortunate, however, that this time you will not stop me.  you will surrender.  as if.  as if if.  shego popped by your school dance and met the nicest boy.  well, i don't have to tell you how nice he is.  and cute.  kim, what's going on.  eric.  the choice is yours, kimberly anne.  if you care about your dear eric's safety, surrender is your only option.  kim, the battle suit is still just experimental.  it's about to get a road test.  how far away is bueno nacho headquarters.  wade: about 100 miles west of here.  i think i'd feel better about this if had a super suit, too, you know.  i'm just sayin'.  she's coming.  of course she is.   ok, wade, we're going in.  check your backpack.  knockout gas that looks like lip gloss or lip gloss that looks like lip gloss.   knockout gas.  thanks for checking on that.  is this some sort of coded message.  history homework.  k.p., since when are you packin'.  it looks like a, um, toy.  oh, this is no toy.  well, not since i modified it.  electromagnetic scrambler.  uh, yeah.  let's pretend i have no idea what that means.  it'll shut down drakken's whole system.  the original bueno nacho, where it all started.  ron, keep your head in the game.  worry not. i'm ready for anything.    i shall be avenged.   what.  dude, don't talk.  the funny voice, yeah, it kind of ruins your mystique.  i am strong like the mountain.  i am swift like the wind.  i am vengeance.    ..  ..  ..  mine.   you know what i really hate.  when somebody kidnaps your boyfriend.  when somebody doesn't know when to give up.    ooh, kimmy got an upgrade.  not bad, huh.  yeah, but still not in my league.  ah.   shego:..  what.  you were saying.   go super suit on her, kimbo.  come on, k.p. yeah. all right.  aah.  yeah. oh, yeah.  uhoh.   ..  wow.  the rondo came to play.  booyah.  ..    hey, eric's cute.  once you're out of the picture, maybe i'll date him.  unh.    didn't know you cared that much.  eric, you're ok.  kim.  eric.  actually, here, i'm known as synthodrone number 901.  aah. unh.      is this heaven.   k.p.  oh, i thought you were down for the count.  why couldn't i see that he was a fake.  yeah, it don't get much faker than a synthodrone.  youoh.  you kissed a synthodrone.  i never kissed him.  but i wanted to.  ok, too much info.  so what's the plan.  ..  i got nothin'.  that's my line.  and what's worse, that's quitter talk.  drakken finally won.  i should've stuck to babysitting.  all right, k.p., this pity fiesta is over.  drakken has not won.  he played you.  now it's payback time.  ..  there are guys out there that are better for you than eric.  gguys that are real, for one thing.  you really think there's a guy out there for me.  ..  ..  oh. really.  you know, guys likehi. rufus.  rufus.   rufus. you can save us.  uhoh.
