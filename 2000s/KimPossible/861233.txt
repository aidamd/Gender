 ght the cape might help jog your memory.  a man whose accomplishments i've admired for as long as i can remember.  well, i'm a modest man.  martin smarty.  the founder of smarty mart.  oh.  you know, see, the cape, although utterly embarrassing , smarty's many mansions is located in cape cod.  i see. rock on, dad.  sure. you'reyou're welcome, son.  ron, you think maybe your dad was hoping to be your hero.  well, he sure saved the day.  wade, can you put me through to our "hero," martin smarty.  i thought you were writing about your dad.  i am. the hookup's for ron.  um, if ron's not writing about his dad, then what's with the cape.  you know about the cape.  police scanner.  someone at bueno nacho must have called security.  oh, hey, you're on.  this is martin.  uh, hi, mr. smarty, sir.  i'm sorry to bother you.  oh, hello, ronald. what's on your mind.  well, you see, i'm doing a paper on my personal hero, and, well, i'd like to interview you, you know, if that's ok.  oh, certainly, i'd be delighted.  booyah.  um, i'm sorry, i meanbooyah, sir.  so, where should we start.  tell you what, i think i can schedule you in say, 3 months.  yeah, uh, the paper's kind of due next week.  sorry we couldn't do business, son, you know how demanding the life of a wealthy corporate mogul can be.   not a clue.  how's the hero hunt going.  oh, gotta be honest, kp, not liking the whole back to square one sitch.  " and he goeswait, i'm losing you.  i said, he goeshe goes..goes.   never mind, i'll text you.  .. goes...  wait a minute. that's it.  what. bonnie. a hero.  i know you're getting desperate, butno, not bonnie. ew.  hego.  so, shego's brother, huh.  the man's a bona fide bondiggity hero.  i mean, he's got the tights and everything.  i'm sure your father would wear tights if he thought it would help.  if my dad shows up at bueno nacho in tights, i'm gonna have to switch to cow and chow for life.    i don't want to be a complex boy    boy, boy, boy, boyboyboyboy   he's your hero.  ahhehehehem.  oh, hi.  just doing the hero diet thing.  bananas. healthy. loaded with potassium.  yellow.  uh, yeah.  look, sorry to interrupt me time, hego, but i really need your help.  team go is sworn to assist in any conundrum.  um, where are the rest of team go.  heroes cruise.  i opted to stay here and, you know, hold down the fort.  couldn't get anyone to switch your shift at bueno nacho, huh.   sometimes having a mildmannered alter ego isn't all it's cracked up to be.  ok, so, um, i need to write a paper on my herothe old hero topic, eh.  say no more.  now, let me begin by mentioning being a hero carries with it a plethora of responsibilities.  that's plethare you getting this down.   it's the mayor. no, really.  looks like we've got us a situation, hego.  your old numerical nemesis is scaring the spit out of the citizens of go city.  you don't meanyes, hego.  the mathter.  the mathter.  ron, don't make fun.  he means the master.  no, he means the mathter.  that's what i said, son. the mathter.  see. um, ok.  so what exactly is a mathter.  what, he's like a homework villain.  the man you see before you is not to be taken lightly.  he's been bent on revenge ever since go city denied him funding for his unethical mathematical experiments.  unethical mathematical experiments.  riiight.  so, maybe you could use a hand with this, um, math villain guy.  ok, but we better hurry, before the mathter does a number on go city.  yes. number. i get it.  hey, wait, wait.  what about my interview.  ok, so, tell me.  how long does your basic, average hero career last.  now, witness as i proceed to subtract go city element by element until it is no longer a factor.  math threats.  there's no telling what the mathter has up his sleeve.  ah. i always knew math was the enemy.  time to add the calculaser to this equation.  aah. get out of the way.  fear not, citizens. help has arrived.  ha. new sidekicks, hego.  no matter. coefficients, subtract them.  ok, i'm a sidekick, admittedly, but she'sheh heh, well, you'll see.    whoa. now that was superbly heroic, man.  what do you call that move.  i'm not sure.  come on, i need your cooperation if this is gonna be any kind of hardhitting interview.  sorry, but i have some hard hitting of my own to do right now.  oh, nice play on words, big guy.  and under pressure, too.  that is so going in the paper.  oh. can't count on anyone these days.  let me throw some numbers at you.  4.  oh. these ought to get my point across.  my decimal point.   ok, question.  is there, like, a school people go to to take hero classes. hey.  oh, brackets.  it seems i need to add a new element to my assault.  good medical, you know, for heroes.  hey.  that cost 20 bucks.  no. no, no, no.  no variables.  i'm putting a placeholder in my memory for you, boy.  this isn't the last you've seen of the mathter.  ok, lame villain.  but i like the hat.  ronald, do you know what's gotten into your father lately.  can't talk. typing hero report.  first, the cape, now he's joined the middleton search and rescue.  it's risky behavior for an actuary.  hadn't noticed.  i just hate to think about him out there in the wilderness with all those wild animals.  eh, he'll be fine.  help. help.   hey, hey.  no, no, you can't crash now.  my report. no, my report.  ow, ow, ow.  oh, man, like i have time for a systems failure.  i'm late for school as it is.  hmm.  ..  can you believe it, kp.  just when i was making major headway, i mean, what am i gonna tellhold it right there, stoppable.  mr. barkin.  what exactly do you think you're doing.  uh, dutifully heading to class.  well, according to my records, you're no longer registered in this school and therefore no longer in the class.  ok, you think you could explain that a little further.  do i have to spell it out for you.  spelling out's best.  you, ron stoppable, are not on the list of enrolled students, so technically, you do not exist.  wait a minute. of course i exist.  i mean, hello, i'm right here in front of you.  so i smell.  but, the list is law.  and i am not going to argue with the computer.  maybe it knows something i don't.  butoh, wait a minute.  so if i'm not in the class, then i'm not required to do the paper, right.  wronggguh.  you were given the assignment when you still existed.  now, if i were you, i'd utilize my newlyfound free time to get to work.  don't worry, ron.  it's probably just a glitch in the system.  we'll straighten it out before you can say " i don't know, kp, first the computer thing, then the school records.  i mean, couldthis day get any worse.  it will if you say that.  hi. do you think i could get my check.  stoppable, ron.  yah, sorry. there is no check here for you.  here we go.  what. well, can you look again.  the name's ron, as in, stoppable.  whoa, dude, aren't you listening.  i told you there's no check.  as in, you know, for you.  maybe just thinking it is enough.  oh, and what do you know.  it looks like you're not on the employee roster, either.  so, on your next visit, it might be best if you return your smarty mart hat and smarty smock.  but i work here.  ok, not according to the roster.  but if you'd like, you can fill out an application.  ..maybe i don't exist and this is all just a dream.  but whose dream.  ok, that does it.  wade, we've got a mystery sitch.  it looks like ron's off the grid.  i'm already on it.  uhoh.  uhoh good or uhoh bad.  when is uhoh ever good.  i don't know. maybe this time.  no school records, no driving records, no work records. nada.  it's like all traces of his existence have been erased.  uhoh, still bad.  but who would want to erase ron.  ha ha. don't you mean subtract.  aw, great, now the math guy's back.  and he's not even our villain.   "we're so sorry you couldn't come with us " oh, it's ok, mego.  there'll be other cruises, other joyous occasions to bond as a family.  " i know, wego.  but someone had to look after the place.  you know, keep vigil.  do some light housekeeping.  i am so lonely.  uh, hego.  oh. hi. yes.  oh, don't mind these.  just a standard hero pastime.  keeps the fingers nimble.  12, 12, 12.  anyway, i thought you should know, the mathter is up to more mathematical mischief in middleton.  ooh, impressive use of alliteration.  ahem. i'm on my way.  sorry, guys, duty calls.  rahhah.   threes.  oh, why don't you just relax and have somepi.  kim.   now it's your turn to feel the full wrath of my math.  ok, i sure could use, i don't know, a hero right about now.  now, prepare to be subtracted entirely, becausebecause what, my number's up.  doh. yes.  dude, how can you be so hepped up about math.  not that i'm judging.  oh yes, i've worked out a very special calculation for you, my meddling little friend.  argh.  that's right, math freak.  nobody messes with my boyfriend.   nevertheless, you'll soon discover i've left your boyfriend with a new problem to solve.  fear not, hego is here.  ok, you might want to work on your timing.  are those seahorses.  now there are simply too many variables in this equation.  i have got to get hooked up with one of those copter hats.  ron, are you ok.  seem to be. heh heh heh.  "calculaser." yeah, whatever.  you didn't happen to notice the mathter affixing his weapon to any special setting, did you.  um, not really. why.  aah. hey, whoa.  aah.  ok, so, why the exploding.  oh, no, it's just as i feared.  and you feared what.  do you want the good news or the bad news first.  surprise me.  the mathter has used a diabolical equation to turn ron into an antimatter boy.  awesome.  everything you touch will explode into complete and utter nothingness.  so that's not the good news, then.  what is.  hanging with ron will be a blast.  uhh. ahh.  oh, it's wet.  ok, not blown away by the upside.  thanks for setting us up with a kickin' antiantimatter containment bubble, dad.  just another reason why you're my hero.  anything for my kimmycub.  besides, this old thing was just taking up space in the attic, anyway.  aww.  i always thought hamster balls looked funfrom the outside.  hmm.  wade and hego are on the mathter hunt, ron.  just try to make the best of it for now, ok.   hey, wade, good news.  no word on the mathter yet.  but i was able to enter ron's info back into the global network.  great. i can go back to school.  in a ball.  oh, yeah.  this is how i roll.  um, ok, maybe the whole trying to act cool thing isn't your best option right now.  look, kp, you wanted me to make the best of it, didn't you.  no. it's too easy.    aah.  uhh. ah.  oh. ow.   the most humiliating day of my life.  ading ding ding ding. we have a new winner.  what about the time you parachuted into the u.n. without your pants.   not even close.  the "i'm all about comfort" excuse brought the security council dress code into the 21st century.  see. there's an upside to everything.   we need an upside, wade.  then you're in luck.  i've detected a high concentration of computational energy on the equator.  zero degrees longitude, zero degrees latitude.  which would place the mathter's h.q. here.  hego should be by any minute in the gokart to pick you up.  we can use all the hero help we can get.  whoa, dad, what happened to you.  didn't i tell you.  today i volunteered at the fire department.  seriously.  you mean, like, in the field.  no, in the kitchen. i made them lunch.  then, how did youoh, i, uh, i started a grease fire.  so, what's with the bubble.  yeah. well, hey, ride's here, dad.  wish us luck.  huh.  little help, kim.  don't wait up, dad.  wait. i want to help.  dad.  i'm not letting you go without me.  no one puts my boy in a bubble.  uh, no capes.  deal.  so, this is what a villain's lair looks like.  i wonder if he's selfinsured.  shh. be extremely cautious.  the mathter has many tricks up his sleeve, and our next step could very well be our last.  you so asked for this.  we need a shield.  use ron. what. hey, aah.  aah. aah.  now, the last hallway doesn't seem so bad.  what are we gonna do.  hego. roll ron after my lead.  mr. s., stick with the big guy. got it.  rufus, do whatever it is you do.  mmhmm.  kim: the calculaser.  ron: look. it's in a bubble, too.  come on, we've got to change ron back to normal before the mathter makes an appearance.  welcome.  i am so glad you're here.  now we can continue our little numbers game.  ok, one more lameo math reference and i'm going to lose it.  perhaps i can enlighten you with my flash cards.  let me guess.  yep. that was my guess.  aah.  game's over, mathter.  minus that, girlie.  we're just getting started.  what you've failed to realize is that we are standing in the culmination of my mathematical genius.  the infinity dome.  in this experimental cognitive energy redoubling chamber, cerebral pulsations and thought waves can be exponentially intensified to form lethal streams of energy.  doh, right. what.  he can turn his twistedmath mind into a weapon, ronald.  very good.  now, who amongst you dares to challenge the mathter at his own game.  i prefer to do things the oldfashioned way.  kim. no.  aah.  ha ha ha ha that was so cute. too easy.  nobody is worthy to stand in the same experimental cognitive energy redoubling chamber as the mathter.  prepare to be subtracted.  ah, excuse me. i'll take that challenge.  dad, no.  ronald, crunching numbers is what i do.  ho. and what kind of hero are you.  i'm no hero.  i'm actuary of the year.  ok, did you have any idea your dad had it in him.  no, but then again, who knew we'd be facing a crazed math villain.  yep. so convenient.  aaahhh.  they should totally teach this way in trig.  totally.  aah. aah.  come on, dad. youarea hero.  aah.  how were you ever able to calculate my every move.  it was easy. i did the math.  brackets.  booyah, dad.  way to teach the bad guy a lesson stoppable style.  ..  let's see if i can get this thing to work.  hey, hey, all right.  whoa. oh, yeah.  hey, that's nice. ha ha.  i was starting to think i'd never get to do that again.   hey, buddy.  you know, from now on, no hamster balls for either of us.  mmhmm.  well, i guess i'll take it from here.  and don't worry, ron.  as soon as this mess is cleared up, i'll be more than happy to help you with the rest of your paper.  sorry, hego.  but it looks like i found myself a new subject for my paper.  you mean it. i'll get my cape.  no capes.  interesting reportyou've turned in there,re, stoppable.  your dad, aka "hero," is a member ofthe middleton search and rescue.  also volunteers at the localfire department. affirmative.  and while in the confinesof a certain infinity dome, he can convertpure mathematical thought into blasts of energythat fire out of his skull.  yeah. it'san actuary thing.  i see.  your dad rocks.aplus.  captioning made possible bydisney abc cable networks group captioning performed bythe national captioning institute, inc.  today's show is all about family.  so go get

family.  the annual clash of the families festival is coming up.  all fine guesses.  but as usual, only malina is right.  so please welcome urkon, the village leader.  clash of the familiesa festival of games pitting village family against village family, father against father, mother against mother.  cousins against cousins.   man, this guy's like a talkatron 2000.  blah, blah, blah, blah.  i can sum this up nice and quick.  every year the village families play a bunch of dumb gamessee, dumb gameto win some dumb prizes.  yep. dumb prize.  and at the end, there's a big mystery event.  what is it. we don't know. it's a mystery.  and as emperor, i always had to make an appearance.  part of the job.  just say i went for the potato salad and stayed for theok, actually, i didn't stay.  that potato salad was disgusting. ugh.  so this year i'm not going at all.  ok, he's got to be done yapping by now.  uncle against third cousin twice removed.  nieceinlaw against grand nephew.  so what do you think this year's mystery event's gonna be.  easy. downhill sled race.  but that was last year.  that's why no one expects it but me.  hmm. how about you, kuzco.  um, the whocaresathon. hahahaha.  come on, this whole thing should be called " losers will be there, but they have winners, too.  like my family. they win every year.  kuzco, living with pacha's family means you get to compete in clash of the families for the first time.  yeah, think of the good time you'll have.  huh.  good time.  we did it. we won again.   no touchy. also can't breathy.  ah, sorry.  look, those are yourgood times. )
