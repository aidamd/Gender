look. he is taunting us.  you are so going to be dinner.  hey, where's the fishing line.  oh, i didn't think you would need it, sokka.   aw, it's all tangled.  not tangled. woven. i made you a necklace, katara. i thought since you lost your other one ...  thanks, aang.  i love it.  great, aang. maybe instead of saving the world, you can go into the jewelrymaking business. i don't see why i can't do both. stop taunting me.  so, how do i look.  you mean, all of you or just your neck.  i mean, because both look great.  smoochie, smoochie, someone's in love.   i ... well, uh ...  stop teasing him, sokka. aang's just a good friend.  a sweet, little guy. just like momo.   thanks.  someone's being attacked by a platypus bear. well, hello there.  nice day, isn't it. make noise. he'll run off. no, play dead. he'll lose interest.  whoa, close one.   run downhill, then climb a tree. no, punch him in the bill.  and then run in zigzags. no need, it's going to be fine.  whoa there.  mmm, lunch.  lucky for you, we came along. thanks, but everything was already under control. not to worry. aunt wu predicted i'd have a safe journey.  aunt who. no, aunt wu. she's the fortuneteller from my village. awful nice knowing your future.  wow, it must be.  that explains why you were so calm. but the fortuneteller was wrong. you didn't have a safe journey. you were almost killed.  but i wasn't. all right, have a good one.  oh, and aunt wu said if i met any travelers to give them this.  maybe we should go see aunt wu and learn our fortunes. it could be fun. oh, come on. fortune telling is nonsense. what do you know. an umbrella. that proves it.   no, it doesn't. you can't really tell the future.  i guess you're not really getting wet then.  of course she predicted it was going to rain. the sky's been gray all day. just admit you might be wrong, and you can come under the umbrella. look, i'm going to predict the future now.  it's going to keep drizzling.  see. not everyone has the gift, sokka.  agh. aunt wu is expecting you.  really. my name is meng and i'm aunt wu's assistant.  well, hello there.  hello.  can i get you some tea or some of aunt wu's special bean curd puffs.  i'll try a curd puff.  just a second.  so what's your name.  aang.  that rhymes with meng. and you've got some pretty big ears, don't you.  i guess.  don't be modest.  they're huge.  well, aang, it was very nice to meet you.  very nice.  likewise. i can't believe we're here in the house of nonsense. try to keep an open mind, sokka. there are things in this world that just can't be explained. wouldn't it be nice to have some insight into your future.  it would be nice to have some bean curd puffs. oh, meng. aunt wu says i'm going to meet my true love. he's going to give me a rare panda lily. that's so romantic.  i wonder if my true love will give me a rare flower.  good luck with that.  is that the bigeared guy who aunt wu predicted you'd marry.  enjoy your snack.  welcome, young travelers. now, who's next. don't be shy.  i guess that's me.  mm, not bad, not bad.  mhm.  i'm good on puffs.  so, what do you think they're talking about back there.  boring stuff i'm sure. love, who she's going to marry, how many babies she's going to have.  yeah, dumb stuff like that ...  well, i've got to find a bathroom. your palms are so smooth. do you use moisturizer. actually, i have this special seaweed lotion. i can get you some if you want.  so, do you see anything interesting in my love line.   i feel a great romance for you. the man you are going to marry.  tell me more. i can see that he's a very powerful bender. looks like someone had a pretty good bathroom break. yeah ... when i was in there ...  i don't even want to know.  who's next.  okay, let's get this over with.  your future is full of struggle and anguish. most of it, selfinflicted.  but you didn't read my palms or anything. i don't need to. it's written all over your face.  you there, come with me. this is the most reliable method of telling your fortune. the bones never lie.  go on, pick one.  now throw it on the fire.  the heat makes cracks in the bone and i read the bone cracks to tell your destiny. wow, that's a big crack.  i've never seen this before.  oh my.  your destiny. this is incredible. you will be involved in a great battle, an awesome conflict between the forces of good and evil. a battle whose outcome will determine the fate of the whole world.  yeah, yeah, i knew that already. but did it say anything about a girl.  a girl. you want to know about love.  yes. i'm sorry, but i didn't see anything.  well, look.  i must've missed something.  right here.  it says "trust your heart and you will be with the one you love." really.  thank you, aunt wu. well, now you got to see for yourselves how fortune telling is just a big, stupid hoax. you're just saying that because you're going to make yourself unhappy your whole life.  that woman is crazy. my life will calm and happy and joyful. that doesn't prove anything.  well, i liked my predictions.  certain things are going to turn out very well.  they sure are ... why. what did she tell you.  some stuff. you'll find out.  what's with the sky.  we are waiting for aunt wu to come and read the clouds to predict the fate of the whole village.  that cloud kind of looks like a fluffy bunny.  you better hope that's not a bunny. the fluffy bunny cloud forecasts doom and destruction.  do you even hear yourself.  the cloud reading will tell us if mt. makapu will remain dormant for another year or if it will erupt. we used to have a tradition once a year of going up the mountain to check the volcano ourselves.  but every since aunt wu moved to the village twenty years ago, we have a tradition of not doing that. i can't believe you would trust your lives to that crazy, old woman's superstition.  shhh. she's coming.  hey, aang.  don't you think that cloud looks like a flower.  huh. sure, i guess.  hey, katara, don't you think that cloud look like a flower.  shhh.  bending arrow cloud ... good crops this year. nice big harvest.  darn good news. wavy, moonshaped cloud ... let's see.  gonna be a great year for twins.  yes.  and a cumulus cloud with a twisted nob coming off the end of it ...  the village will not be destroyed by the volcano this year.  since i got you here, uh, there's something i want to tell you. i like you, but more than normal.  never mind. hi, aunt wu. sorry to bother you. any time. about this man i'm supposed to marry ...  is he going to be handsome.  oh, i hope he's tall. ah ... you want another reading. yes, please. i can't believe all these saps.  someone really needs to scream some sense into them. they seem happy, sokka. not for long. i'm going to prove aunt wu's predictions are nonsense.  hey you, i bet aunt wu told you to wear those red shoes, didn't she.  yeah. she said i'd be wearing red shoes when i met my true love. uh huh ... and how many times have you worn those shoes since you got that fortune.  everyday.  then of course it's gonna come true.  really. you think so.  i'm so excited. and then you will have your third greatgrandchild before quietly passing away in your sleep.  is that enough information for you.  wow, thanks, aunt wu.  oh wait, one more thing. how warmly should i dress tomorrow. you want me to do a reading for that.  i don't care what aunt wu told you. you have to take a bath sometime. so, sokka, you know some stuff about ladies, right.  some stuff.  you've come to the right place. what can i do you for. well, there's this girl.  i think i know who you mean.  you do. and you're okay with it. of course i am. and to tell you the truth, i've been picking up a subtle vibe that she likes you, too.  she does. oh yeah, she's crazy about you. all you have to do now is not mess it up. well, how do i do that. the number once mistake nice guys like you make: being too nice. you can be too nice. yep. if you want to keep her interested, you have to act aloof, like you don't really care one way or the other. well, okay ... hey, aang, i was wondering ... see you later ...   wow, that kid is good. and you'll be fine as long as you've got a scarf. byebye now. okay, okay, but one more thing.  all right, what is it.  should i eat a mango or a papaya for breakfast tomorrow.  papaya.   aww, i hate papaya.  oh, hey, katara. i didn't see you there.  hey, aang.   that's okay. i'm busy with my own stuff.  ugh, papaya please.  so ... papaya. uh huh. would you like some.  you know me. i don't really care what i eat.  okay then. see you later.  maybe aloof isn't my style.  oh, a panda lily.  did you see that. excuse me.  where can a guy find one of those things.  i can't believe you're dragging me all the way up here for a stupid flower. not just any flower, a panda lily. i've seen it in action and boy, does it work. flowers are fine once you're married, but at this early stage, it's critical that you maintain maximum aloofness. but my heart is telling me to get this flower,  and aunt wu said if i trusted in my heart, i will be with the one i love.  what. don't tell me you believe in that stuff, too.  well, aunt wu hasn't been wrong yet. why should she be wrong about love.  there. on the rim.  oh no.  aunt wu was wrong. those people all think they're safe. we've got to warn them. there's no time to walk.  grab on.   hi, katara.  can you believe she won't let me in. and after all the business i've given her. but she doesn't even charge. i know, but still ... well, we have other things to worry about. aunt wu was wrong about the volcano.  sokka, you tried to convince me she was wrong before. it's going to take an awful lot to change my mind   oh no.  everyone, that volcano is gonna blow any second. aunt wu was wrong.  yeah, yeah, we know you don't believe in aunt wu, mr. science and reason lover.  if you won't listen to him, maybe you'll listen to me. i want to believe aunt wu and her predictions as much as you do, but my brother and aang saw the lava with their own eyes.  well, i heard aunt wu's prediction with my own ears.  please listen to us. you are all in danger. and we have to get out of here. you can't rely on aunt wu's prediction,  you have to take fate into your own hands. look.  can your fortune telling explain that.  can your science explain why it rains.  yes. yes, it can.  they just won't listen to reason.   but they will listen to aunt wu. i know that's the problem. well, it's about to become the solution. we're taking fate in our own hands. first, i need to borrow aunt wu's cloud reading book.  shhh. we don't want anyone to hear us. oh, i didn't see you there.  you don't like me, do you.  of course i like you.  but not the way i like you. oh, i guess not. it's okay. it's just really hard when you like someone, but they don't think of you that way.  i know what you mean.  she's beautiful, by the way.  huh.  that water tribe girl. i can see why you like her so much.  she's sweet, she's a bender  and her hair seems so manageable.  don't worry. you're going to meet a great guy who's going to completely fall for you. i know it.  thanks.  wait. don't you want this.  how did you know.  i've kind of been stalking you.  heh ...  oh, thanks ... i guess. clouds are made of water and air, so between the two of us, we ought to be able to bend them into any shape we want.  i found it. the symbol for volcanic doom. aunt wu, look. something is happening in the clouds.  that's very strange. it shouldn't ...  oh my. we still can save the village if we act fast.  sokka has a plan.  lava is gonna flow downhill to this spot. if we can dig a deep enough trench we can channel all the lava away from the village to the river. if any of you are earthbenders, come with me.  i'm an earthbender.  i'm not. everybody else grab a shovel  come on. we've gotta hurry.  dig faster. dig faster. everyone needs to evacuate. we'll come for you when it's safe. it's too much. it's gonna overflow. man, sometimes i forget what a powerful bender that kid is.  wait, what did you just say.  nothing, just that aang is one powerful bender.  i suppose he is.  by the way, we kind of borrowed your book. so you messed with the clouds, did you.  very clever. no offense, but i hope this taught everyone a lesson about not relying too much on fortune telling.  but aunt wu predicted the village wouldn't be destroyed and it wasn't. she was right, after all.  i hate you.  it's okay, sokka. everything's going to be all right. can i ask you something. of course, honey.  you didn't really see love in my fortune, did you. you just told me what i wanted to hear. i'll tell you a little secret, young airbender.  just as you reshaped those clouds,  you have the power to shape your own destiny.  goodbye everyone. it was so nice to meet you.  take care, meng.  take care.  floozy. ) )
