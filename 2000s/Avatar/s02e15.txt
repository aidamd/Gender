this drill is a feat of scientific ingenuity and raw destructive power. once it tunnels through the wall, our troops will storm their city. the earth kingdom will finally fall, and you can claim ba sing se in the name of your father. nothing can stop us.  hmmm, what about those muscley guys down there.  please. the drill's metal shell is impervious to any earthbending attack. oh, i'm sure it is, war minister qin, but just to be on the safe side ...  mai and ty lee, take the earthbenders out.  finally, something to do.   aang, what are you doing here. i thought you were looking for appa. i was, but something stopped me. something big. now what's so big that appa has to wait.  that.  we made it to ba sing se and we're still not safe. no one is.  what are you people doing here. civilians aren't allowed on the wall. i'm the avatar. take me to whoever is in charge.  it is an honor to welcome you to the outer wall, young avatar, but your help is not needed. not needed.  not needed. i have the situation under control. i assure you the fire nation cannot penetrate this wall. many have tried to break through it, but none have succeeded. what about the dragon of the west. he got in.  well ... uh, technically yes, but he was quickly expunged.  nevertheless, that is why the city is named ba sing se. it's the "impenetrable city". they don't call it na sing se.  that means "penetrable city." yeah, thanks for the tour, but we still got the drill problem. not for long. to stop it, i've sent an elite platoon of earthbenders called the terra team. that's a good group name. very catchy. ready ... attack.  we're doomed.   get a hold of yourself, man.  you're right. i'm sorry. maybe you'd like the avatar's help now.  yes, please. the question is, how are we going to stop that thing.  why are you all looking at me. you're the idea guy.  so i'm the only one who can ever come up with a plan. that's a lot of pressure. and also the complaining guy. that part i don't mind. so, mr. lee and mr. ummm ... mushy, is it. it's pronounced mushi.  you telling me how to do my job.  uh, no, no. but may i just say you're like a flower in bloom. your beauty is intoxicating.  you're pretty easy on the eyes yourself, handsome. raorr. welcome to ba sing se.   i'm going to forget i saw that.  i think lee would make a good freedom fighter. he's just trying to find his way in the world, like us. you don't know anything about him, jet. i know he didn't get that scar from a waterbender. besides, i thought we were going straight now. we are, and the new freedom fighters could use a guy like lee. what do you think, longshot. i can respect that. what's wrong with him. he doesn't look injured. his chi is blocked.  who did this to you. two girls ambushed us. one of them hit me with a bunch of quick jabs and suddenly i couldn't earthbend anymore and i could barely move. then she cartwheeled away.  ty lee. she doesn't look dangerous, but she knows the human body and its weak points. it's like she takes you down from the inside.  ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. ooh. yes. what you just said. that's how we're going to take down the drill. the same way ty lee took down all those big earthbenders. by hitting its pressure points.  we'll take it down from the inside.  once i whip up some cover, you're not going to be able to see. so, stay close to me. run. hey, look at that dust cloud.  it's so ... poofy.  poof. don't worry, princess. i'm sure it's nothing.  everyone into the hole. it's so dark down here, i can't see a thing.  oh no, what a nightmare.  sorry. there. toph, come on. no way am i going in that metal monster. i can't bend in there. i'll try to slow it down out here. okay, good luck.  i need a plan of this machine. some schematics that show what the inside looks like. then we can find its weak points. where are we going to get something like that.  what are you doing. someone's going to hear us. that's the point. i figure a machine this big needs engineers to run it. and when something breaks ... they come to fix it.  hi. this'll work. thanks. it looks like the drill is made up of two main structures. there's the inner mechanism where we are now and the outer shell. the inner part and the outer part are connected by these braces. if we cut through them, the entire thing will collapse. so, you guys got plans once you're inside the city. get your hot tea here. finest tea in ba sing se.  ooh. jasmine please. blaugh. ugh, coldest tea in ba sing se is more like it. what a disgrace. hey, can i talk to you for a second. you and i have a much better chance of making it in the city if we stick together. you want to join the freedom fighters. thanks, but i don't think you want me in your gang. come on, we made a great team looting that captain's food. think of all the good we could do for these refugees.  i said no. have it your way. hey.  what are you doing firebending your tea. for a wise, old man, that was a pretty stupid move.  i know you're not supposed to cry over spilled tea, but ...  it's just so sad. wow, it looks a lot thicker in person than it does in the plans. we're going to have to work pretty hard to cut through that.  what's this "we" stuff. aang and i are going to have to do all the work.  look, i'm the plan guy. you two  are the cut stuff up with waterbending guys.  together, we're team avatar.  c'mon team. don't quit now.  we're ...  grrr. i mean,  you're almost there.  at this rate, we won't do enough damage before the drill reaches the wall. i don't know how many more of those i have in me. do you hear that. we took it down. we better get out of here fast. congratulations, crew. the drill has made contact with the wall of ba sing se.  start the countdown to victory.  c'mon brace ... budge.  this is bad, really bad. we're putting everything we've got into busting these braces, but it's taking too long.  maybe we don't need to cut all the way through. toph has been teaching me that you shouldn't give one hundred percent of your energy into any one strike.  sokka, take a fighting stance. you've got to be quick and accurate. hit a series of points and break your opponent's stance.  and when he's reeling back, you deliver the final blow.  his own weight becomes his downfall, literally. so we just need to weaken the braces, instead of cutting all the way through. then i'll go to the top of this thing and deliver the final blow.  and boom. it all comes crashing down. everyone inside that wall. the whole world is counting on us. the whole world minus the fire nation that is.  c'mon, twinkle toes, hurry up. that's enough. we need to get to the next one. war minister, an engineer was ambushed. his schematics were stolen. war minister, a brace on the starboard side has been cut clean through. it's sabotage, sir.  let's go, ladies. good work, team avatar. now aang just needs to ...  duck.  whoa. wow, azula, you were right. it is the avatar.  ... and friends.  hey. guys, get out of here. i know what i need to do. wait.  you need this water more than i do. follow them. the avatar's mine.  slurry pipeline. what does that mean.  it's rock and water mixed together. it means our way out.  ugh, disgusting. c'mon. you heard azula. we have to follow them. she can shoot all the lightning she wants at me. i am not going in that wall sludge juice.   why don't you try blocking my chi now, circus freak. katara, keep that up. the pressure will build up in the drill. then when aang delivers the final blow, it'll be ready to pop.  this looks like a good spot, momo.  general sung, tell your soldiers to stop shooting rocks down here.  soldiers, whatever you do, don't stop shooting rocks down there. good technique, little sister. keep it up. don't forget to breathe.  you know, i'm just about sick and tired of you telling me what to do all day. you're like a chattering hogmonkey.  just bend the slurry, woman.  you guys need some help. toph, help me plug up this drain.  what i'd give to be a metalbender.  momo, get out of here. thanks, momo. i owe you one.  now all i need ...  actually, that is what i need for once. woohoo. here it comes.  we lost. last call for ba sing se. jet, relax. so the old guy had some hot tea. big deal. he heated it himself.  those guys are firebenders. what a handsome baby.  thank you. i just want to say, good effort out there today, team avatar.  enough with the team avatar stuff. no matter how many times you say it, it's not going to catch on. how about ...  the boomeraang squad. see it's good because it's got "aang" in it. boomeraang.  i kind of like that one.  let's talk about this on our way into the city. the aang gang. sokka ... the fearsome foursome.  you're crazy. why. we're fearsome. ) )
