hey. you guys picked a great campsite.  the grass is so soft. that's not grass.  appa's shedding.  oh, gross.  that's not gross, it's just a part of spring. you know, rebirth, flowers blooming and appa gets a new coat.  ah, the beauty of spring.  stop. appa, stop. ugh.   it's not that bad, katara.  it makes a great wig.  and a great beard.   i'm just glad we finally have another girl in the group, because you two are disgusting.  excuse me, does anyone have a razor. because i've got some hairy pits. so toph, usually when setting up camp, we try to divide up the work.  hey, don't worry about me. i'm good to go. well, actually what i'm trying to say is,  some of us might fetch water, while someone else might set up the fire pit, or put up the tent.  even momo does his fair share.  katara, i'm fine. i can carry my own weight. i don't need a fire,  i've already collected my own food and look,  my tent's all set up.  well, that's great for you, but we still need to finish   i don't understand what's the problem here.  never mind.  sorry.  hey toph, i wanted to apologize for earlier. i think we're all just a little tired and getting on each other's nerves.  yeah, you do seem pretty tired.  i meant all of us. well, good night.  good night. there's something coming toward us. what is it.  it feels like an avalanche, but also not an avalanche.  your powers of perception are frightening. should we leave. better safe than sorry. what is that thing.  ah, land sweet land.  see you guys in the morning. actually, can you help us unload.  really. you need me to help unload sokka's funkysmelling sleeping bag.  well, yeah. that and everything else. you're a part of our team now, and   look. i didn't ask you to help unload my stuff.  i'm carrying my own weight.  that's not the point.  ever since you joined us, you've been nothing but selfish and unhelpful.  what. look here, sugar queen,  i gave up everything i had so that i could teach aang earthbending. so don't you talk to me about being selfish.  "sugar queen".. ddid you just slam the door in my face.. how can you be so infuriating.. should we do something.  hey, i'm just enjoying the show.  okay, okay, you both need to calm down. "both"..  i'm completely calm..  i ... can see that.   the stars sure are beautiful tonight. too bad you can't see them, toph.  hey, how's a guy supposed to sleep with all this yelling  and earthquaking.  that thing is back. well, how far away is it.  maybe we can close our eyes just for a few minutes.  i don't think so, sokka. seriously, what is that thing. and how does it keep finding us.  i don't know. but this time, i'm going to make sure we lose it.  okay, forget about setting up camp.  i'm finding the softest pile of dirt and going to sleep.  that's good because toph wasn't going to help anyway.  oh, i didn't realize the baby still needed someone to tuck her in bed. come on guys, there's something after us and we don't even know what  or who it is. it could be zuko.  we haven't seem him since the north pole. who's zuko.  oh, just some angry freak with a ponytail who's tracked us all over the world.  what's wrong with ponytails, ponytail.  this is a warrior's wolf tail.  well, it certainly tells the other warriors that you're fun and perky.  anyway, whoever's chasing us couldn't have followed us here, so, now would everyone just shhh.  no momo, shhh.  sleepy time.  oh, don't tell me ... that's impossible. there's no way they could have tracked us. i can feel it with my own two feet.  let's get out of here.  maybe we should face them. find out who they are. who knows, maybe they're friendly.  always the optimist ...  it's those three girls from omashu.  we can take them. three on three. actually toph, there's four of us.  oh, i'm sorry, i didn't count you. you know, no bending and all.  i can still fight.  okay, three on three plus sokka.  errrgh. well, we wanted to find out who they were and we found out.  now let's get out of here. appa, yip yip.  i can't believe those girls followed us all the way from omashu.  i still think we could have taken them. are you kidding me.  the crazy blue firebending and the flying daggers are bad enough, but last time we saw them, one of those girls did something that took my bending away. that's scary.  oh no, the sun is rising. we've been up all night with no sleep.  sokka, we'll be okay.  are you sure. i've never not slept before.  what if i fall asleep now and something happens.  and something always happens. every time we land, those girls are there. so we'll just have to keep flying. we can't keep flying forever.  so what's our plan.  don't know ... too tired to think. i'm sure we'll come up with something after a short nap.   yes ... sleep.  what's going on. appa fell asleep.  wake up, buddy. appa's exhausted.  okay, we've put in a lot of distance between us and them. the plan right now is to follow appa's lead and get some sleep.  of course, we could've gotten some sleep earlier,  if toph didn't have such issues.  what..  all right, all right, everyone's exhausted. let's just get some rest.  no, i want to hear what katara has to say. you think i have issues.  i'm just saying. maybe if you helped out earlier, we could have set up our camp faster and gotten some sleep  and then maybe we wouldn't be in this situation. you're blaming me for this.  no. no, she's not blaming you.  no, i'm blaming her. hey,  i never asked you for diddlydoodah.  i carry my own weight. besides, if there's anyone to blame, it's sheddy over here.  what. you're blaming appa. yeah, you want to know how they keep finding us.  he's leaving a trail everywhere we go.  how dare you blame appa. he saved your life three times today. if there's anyone to blame it's you. you're always talking about how you carry your own weight, but you're not. he is. appa's carrying your weight. he never had a problem flying when it was just the three of us.  i'm out of here.  wait. what did i just do.  i can't believe i yelled at my earthbending teacher. now she's gone.  i know. we're all just trying to get used to each other. and i was so mean to her.  yeah, you two were pretty much jerks.  thanks, sokka. no problem. we need to find toph and apologize. okay, but what are we going to do about the tank full of dangerous ladies chasing us.  i have a plan. toph was right. the fur was leaving a trail right to us. but now that he's clean, no more trail. are you sure he's okay to fly. he'll be fine as long as we leave his saddle and all our stuff here.  i'm going to use appa's fur to make a fake trail to lead the tank offcourse. ow ... that really hurt my tailbone.  wads of wet fur. how delightful.  hmmm ... they're not wads, they're more like bundles, or bunches.  it's got an "uh" sound.  clumps.  clumps. they're clumps.   the trail goes this way. the avatar's trying to give us the slip.  you two head in that direction and keep your eye out for the bison.  i'll follow this trail.  toph couldn't have made it too far.  what is it, momo. ooooh, no. katara.  how did they find us.  appa, come on, we need to go faster. he's too tired.  not good, not good.  we just need to make it across that river.  come on appa, just a little further ...  we made it. we're safe.  you did it appa.  good try, but no. how are you doing.  well, you know ...  i thought when ty lee and i finally caught you guys, it would be more exciting. oh well, victory is boring.  thanks appa, i don't know what we'd do without you.  was it just me, or was that guy kind of cute. all right, you've caught up with me. now, who are you and what do you want.  you mean you haven't guessed. you don't see the family resemblance. here's a hint.  i must find the avatar to restore my honor.  it's okay, you can laugh. it's funny. so what now.  now. now, it's over. you're tired and you have no place to go.  you can run, but i'll catch you.  i'm not running.  here is your tea.  you seem a little too young to be traveling alone.  you seem a little too old.  perhaps i am.  i know what you're thinking ... i look like i can't handle being by myself. i wasn't thinking that. you wouldn't even let me pour my own cup of tea. i poured your tea because i wanted to and for no other reason. people see me and think i'm weak. they want to take care of me, but i can take care of myself, by myself. you sound like my nephew, always thinking you need to do things on your own, without anyone's support. there is nothing wrong with letting the people who love you help you. not that i love you, i just met you.  so where is your nephew. i've been tracking him actually. is he lost.  yes, a little bit.  his life has recently changed and he's going through very difficult times. he's trying to figure out who he is and he went away. so now you're following him. i know he doesn't want me around him right now, but if he needs me, i'll be there. your nephew is very lucky, even if he doesn't know it.  thank you. my pleasure. sharing tea with a fascinating stranger is one of life's true delights.  no, thank you for what you said. it helped me. i'm glad.  oh, and about your nephew, maybe you should tell him that you need him, too. do you really want to fight me. yes, i really do.  zuko.  i was wondering when you'd show up, zuzu.  "zuzu".  back off, azula. he's mine.  i'm not going anywhere.  katara.  uncle ... get up. i thought you guys could use a little help.  thanks.  well, look at this. enemies and traitors, all working together. i'm done.  i know when i'm beaten. you got me. a princess surrenders with honor.  aaaah.  ugggh.  get away from us. zuko, i can help.  leave. ) )
