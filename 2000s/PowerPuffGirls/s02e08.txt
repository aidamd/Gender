dream scheme transcribed by alan back     narrator:        the city of townsville, in all of its glory. it is the setting of this little story.    narrator:        let us begin on the back of the globe.  where people are dressed in pj and robe.  they kick off their slippers and climb into beds, fluff up their pillows and lay down their heads.    narrator:        now everyone is ready to sleep for the night.  enter the sandman to do them up right.    narrator:        reaching into his bag with his free hand, he pulls out a magical brown grain of sand.    narrator:        a piece in the eyes  the left and the right,  and out goes the victim, asleep for the night.    narrator:        and so on to every home in every city, the sandman does his job, singing his ditty.    sandman:        im the little sandman, thats no doubt,                                          putting you to sleep is what im about. when your eyes get heavy, dont you pout, ill show up and put you out.    narrator:        the sandman finishes with no time to spare. and poof. he disappears back to his lair.    narrator:        just as soon as the sandman gets back, he scratches his fanny and heads for the sack.    narrator:        but before he can reach that place so desired  again he must go where sleep is required. clang, clang, clang goes the alarm. oh, what a pain.    narrator:      it seems theyre going to bed in ukraine.    narrator:         that task done, its time to get going.  look at those eyes. i think thats fatigue showing.    narrator:        so, back to the sanctity of his lair,  for some welldeserved sleep. its only fair.  as hes about to catch up on the sleep that hes missed  off goes the minialarm he wears on his wrist.    narrator:        who is it now, pulling him away from his home.  why, its the italians, going el snoozo in rome    narrator:        adhering to the schedule he is stuck to    narrator:        off he goes to put them asleep in timbuctoo.    narrator:        hitting every city in the world, its no joke, london, paris, cairo, even royal oak.    narrator:        so it goes, twentyfour hours a day without pause, three hundred sixtyfive nights a year  unlike that santy claus.    narrator:        meanwhile, back in the city we all love and know,  more specifically, the utonium chateau    narrator:        where the girls are still making a clatter,  in pops the professor  to see whats the matter.    professor:       girls, whats the noise. its time for bed. bubbles:         were not sleepy. buttercup:      we want to stay up instead. professor:       well, you know, thats all dandy and fine.  into bedthats the bottom line. girls:               but, professor professor:       no buts, and i mean it.  bubbles:         does anybody want a peanut.  professor:       i want you in bed. thats my final warning. dont you know ive got work in the morning.    narrator:        and with that, he closes the door tight  and tucks himself in to sleep for the night.    narrator:        back at his lair, the sandman tries the same.  but off goes the alarm.  townsville to blame.    sandman:        thats it. no more. i quit. i never get to sleep, and im tired of it.  wait. ive an idea that just might work. narrator:        he said with an evil, toothy kind of smirk. sandman:        ill fill the machine. oh, this is so clever.  a machine that will put them all to sleep forever.    narrator:        and so it is built, just as he planned.  a machine to sprinkle the world with his sand. he punches the numbers and pulls down the handle  out goes the world, just like a candle.    sandman:        i did it. i did it. now i can hit the hay. i think ill sleep an extra seventeen hours a day. narrator:        but before he can enjoy the fruit of his pains    narrator:        off goes the alarm. someone remains.    sandman:        oh. whos still awake. narrator:        he said with remorse.    narrator:        why, its the powerpuff girls with insomnia, of course. sandman:        oh, those brats are ruining my ploy. by staying awake, theyre stealing my joy. ill pay them a visit, a little house call,  and take care of this matter once and for all.    narrator:        back in their room, the girls continue playing, when all of a sudden they hear someone saying    sandman:  you three girls are ruining my plan. now get into bed as quick as you can. buttercup:      who are you to make us. narrator:        buttercup did exclaim.  sandman:        why, im the sandman, the one and the same. i come to you now with only one dream, which is why i hatched up this wonderful scheme. i want to sleep and doze and slumber and nap, so i put the world to sleep. it was a snap.     sandman:        forever theyll sleep, that ive no doubt  and you three girls ill also put out. blossom:            weve got to stop this awful oppressor. bubbles.  buttercup.  wake the professor. sandman:     you can try and wake him, try as you might  sandman:  but i guarantee you hes out like a light.    narrator:        to put them to sleep is the reason he came.  so he pulls out his weapon and takes sharp aim.  the girls fly up in typical formation, to stop the sandman and his evil creation.    sandman:        hold still now. ive just about enough. blossom:         you cant hurt us, cause were the powerpuff    narrator:        but before the girls can finish their call, the sandman finishes them, once and for all.  sandman:        victory is mine. ive won, thats who. now theres only one thing left for me to do.  narrator:        and with that, he vanishes in thin air, most likely to sleep back at his lair.  so i guess thats it. what can i say.  oh, who wouldve thought it woulda ended this way.    buttercup:      hey, what are you two doing in one of my dreams. bubbles:         were all in each others, or so it seems. blossom:         this is a power i never knew we had. bubbles:         its totally cool. buttercup:      yeah, it aint half bad. blossom:         but lets get down to the matter at hand how to defeat that dispenser of sand. buttercup:      why dont we just go and beat him right up. blossom:         always the violent way, eh, buttercup.  bubbles:         ive got an idea. its way out of sight. well infiltrate his dreams and give him a fright. blossom:         yes, scare him so bad that hell never want to sleep again. bubbles, youre clever.    buttercup:      careful, bubbles, your ego is showing. bubbles:         what. where. blossom:         come on, lets get going.                     sandman:        im awake. please stay out of my dreams. never again will i hatch any schemes.  im throwing the switch and hitting the number and awaking them all from eternal slumber.  oh, would you look at the time. i gotta get cracking. people are waiting. my, ive been slacking.  narrator:        and off he goes, off to his job, never to sleep again, the poor slob.  the world awakes without missing a beat, unaware of the sandmans defeat.    bubbles:         yay. buttercup:      we did it. blossom:         were awake. bubbles:         im pooped. buttercup:      lets hit the hay. blossom:         for goodness sake.    narrator:        and finally, for all their troubles, they deserve the sleep  buttercup, blossom, and bubbles.    professor:       its morning, girls. oh, how the night sure flies. wake up and rub the sand from your eyes.    narrator:        oh, professor, perhaps youd better turn around. because while the rest of us were sleeping sound,    narrator:        the earth was saved just as it twirls    narrator:        thanks again to the powerpuff girls. ) )
