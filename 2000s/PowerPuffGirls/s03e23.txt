future. and that's why i'm pushing my protractor initiative for the math team.   agh. the bats are back. and getting rid of the bats that have overrun the cafetorium.  but whatever happens, the most important thing is that we all have a fair and civil election. i couldn't agree more. ah. my distinguished opponent, matt manser. i look forward to running a good, clean campaign against you. thanks,

know what the golden rule says if someone is mean to you, you're allowed to be doubly mean back. bubbles, that's not what the golden rule says at all. look, i know morbucks can be a little rude, but i'm sure if i talk to her, she'll realize how fun elections are when you just play fair.  play fair ha. that's hilarious. have you ever met me. i'm gonna drag your name through the dirt. fine. do your worst, morbucks. i don't care. i'm gonna run a fair campaign, and i'm gonna win. i don't care man: entire school. i'm gonna man: beat up all of your grandparents after. and win. no. not my nana.

local wrestling arena, as the bats have now taken over the cafetorium indefinitely.  why, that is outrageous. can't wait to see the fight. uh, ii mean debate. i meant debate.  yeah.  oh, here comes our first contender.      and here comes morbucks.  let's get political. morbucks.  let's see what matt manser's got up his sleeve.  oh, hey, everyone. i didn't know we were supposed to plan anything.    hey, guys, they forgot to get me a podium, but that's okay. i brought my own. let's get right into the debate. oh, yeah. whoo. first off, i'd like to say how grateful i am to be here. yeah. well, i'm even more grateful. well, i'm the most grateful. well, i'm most grateful times infinity. i'm most grateful times infinity plus one.  well, in the spirit of friendship, i  listen up, blossom. this election is mine. we'll see about that. blossryuken.   girl: whoa. looks like morbucks is down for the count.  girl: wait. what's this.  girl: whoohoo.  looks like morbucks is back in business.    tex: now this is a debate. as blossom's campaign managers, should we get in there. yes. yes, we should. do you smell what the powerpuff girls are cooking. yeah, i do. and it's coming from your butt.  who's got the power. we got the power i'd like to open up the floor to questions now. oof. aah. ooh, yeah i love politics. whoohoo. boom shackalacka. i'd never vote for morbucks.  oh, bubbles. i'll let you pet my tiger if you vote for me. you can't buy me, morbucks. i'll let you pet him twice. done. bubbles, if you vote for me  we can have cookies for breakfast.  cookies.  i'll mail you boxes of puppies.  puppies.  i'll clean your room.  morbuck: i'll buy you a theme park. blossom: i'll do all your chores. morbuck: i'll print money with your face on it. blossom: i'll do your homework forever. morbuck: i'll buy you better sisters. ugh. i don't know who to vote for. i hate politics. looks like she's turned into some kind of political dinosaur. yeah. vote for this.  oh, looks like i lost her vote. you're not gonna get any votes.  well, at least i'm not the  queen.   you all have very good points, but i have a slightly different angle on this. politics isn't about how other people are doing the wrong things, but how we can work together to make things right. with all of us on the same team, there's no problem we can't handle. now, let's make this school a better place.   he's right. politics isn't about fighting or money. it's about working together. the way i've been acting, i don't deserve to be president. i hereby pull out of the presidential race, and i back matt manser.    wait. we're not fighting anymore. well, there's always next year. don't worry, you'll always be the  queen to me. very funny. hiya, blossom. hi, matt. congratulations on winning the election. and thanks for supporting the protractor initiative in my stead. of course. i mean, without angles, life is pretty pointless, am i right.  yikes. aah. the bats have multiplied.  ) )
