spring back.  i wish i could bring spring back, too.  ahem.  oh. that was supposed to be a personal moment. blossom. it was you the whole time.. we thought it was the effects of climate change. ii didn't want to. i was just so nervous about answering jared shapiro's note, and i needed extra time to think about it, so i made the snow day last a little longer. a month.. but you guys like the snow. it's a winwin for everyone. and the yetis.. i'm sorry. but, honestly, the yetis may be annoying, but they are not monsters.  whoohoo.    ugh. i guess it was only a matter of time before zack showed up. tell me about it. that guy ruined the matterhorn.  oh, no. hey. quit destroying our town. this ain't your town anymore. this is our town.   you made all this happen because you were scared of your boyfriend..  yo, that's cold. hold that thought.  freezing townsville is no way to solve the problem. ice eventually melts.  you need to face your problems headon.  it's time to take care of business, bloss. i know. but, guys.  no more ice breath. yeah.  but no more ice breath. no more ice breath.  except that time. that time was good. okay, girls, you're right. time to take care of

gave me was very sweet. and while i think that you're really great, and some may even say i have a crush on you, i've given it much thought. and after consulting those closest to me, i've concluded that i'm just not ready for a relationship. is that okay. oh, uh i'm not ready for a relationship, either. i just think you're neat. oh. uhditto.  hey, you want to grab a snow cone. oh, man, i think i've had enough snow for a while.  ooh. how romantic. powerpuff girls fighting crime saving the world before bedtime battling evil toetotoe saving the day, a powerpuff goal ) )
