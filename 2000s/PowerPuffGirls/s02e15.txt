could have been fuzzy lumkins.    bubbles:  yeehaw. with my magic banjo, i brought the beast to life.  blossom: noi dont think fuzzy can be that creative. buttercup:  maybe it was me.    buttercup: i have the power, the skill, and the wardrobe  to create such a beast. blossom:  no. it was not you.    blossom: it was me. mojo jojo. only the greatest scientific mind this side of the galaxy could create such a beast. and because i have yet to meet a greater scientific mind this side of the galaxy, i can comfortably say that sentence comfortably.    buttercup: thats so true.  blossom: do not try and stop mojo  uh.    bubbles: take that, mojo jojo.  blossom:  bubbles. what part of this pretend game dont you get.. bubbles: what do you mean. blossom: im not the real mojo jojo.  im blossom in

secret hideout.  while you two, as the powerpuff girls  will try to hunt me down and stop me from my most diabolical plan. buttercup: and once we find you, the most important battle of our lives will ensue. blossom: yes, yes, yes.  but pretend, of course.  bubbles:  i know. blossom: now, close your eyes and count to sixty.    bubbles, buttercup: one, two  three, four, five, six, seven     blossom:
