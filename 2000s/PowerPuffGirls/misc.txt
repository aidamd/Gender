there. him: yes, she does.  mojo: but, still... him: yeah.  fuzzy: hey, i wanna fight, too.   him:  did we just do what i think we did. mojo: yes. individually, we have failed time and again. but

blossom: we're never saving the day again. professor utonium: oh, you can't do that. what will townsville do when they look for the girls with the sun in their eyes and they're gone. blossom: but what can we do. professor utonium: well, first of you have to realize that the beatalls are just a rock band. girls: huh. professor utonium: fuzzy, he does thatthatrock thing. but that's not important. what is important is this: mojo jojo was a man who thought he was a loner, but he knew it couldn't last. he's just getting by with a little help from his friends. buttercup: are you saying we should try to break up the beatalls. professor utonium: sure. i'm certain that it happens all the time. girls: but how. professor utonium: listen: do you want to know a secret. narrator: sounds like the

minutes.  him:  very clever. oh, you got that one without trying. now do this without flying. go to the corner of chang and ching, there on the street the phone will ring. what then, you might ask. answer the phone to get your next task.  you've got three minutes.  blossom: we did it, him. now what. him:  well, well. presidential fitness awards all around.  now let's excercise your brain.  train a left pokey oaks train station at 11:40 at a hundred miles per hour. train b left norwalk station 10 minutes later at 90 miles per hour heading towards train a.  where will they collide. blossom: bubbles. think of the professor. him:  you've got one minute.  buttercup: can't you abacus any faster. blossom: "abacus" my butt.  him:  well, girls, you caught these two trains right on time. blossom: we're finished with this nonsense, him. now where's the professor. him: but i've only just started. in the ear of corn, you will find happiness, joy, and the ties that bind. squirrels store

seconds.  him:  i can't believe you got that one right.  you got the right flavor and everything.  blossom: we'd go to the ends of the earth for the professor. him:  touching.  now here's something i hope you'll really enjoy.  powerpuff girls: ms. keane. him: yes'm. the real ms. keane will tell you the truth. the fake one will tell you a lie. discover which is your beloved teacher and she'll be saved. fail, and they both will be dropped into this vat of boiling sharks. ms. keanes: girls, help. him: you may ask them only one question. so make it count.  45 seconds. go. bubbles: this ones easy. all we have to do is ask which one is the real ms. keane. blossom: not quite, bubbles. the one that lies will just tell us shes the real ms. keane. buttercup: yeah, dont be stupid, bubbles. ill just ask which one wants a knuckle sandwich. blossom: same problem, buttercup. we need a question theyll have to answer differently. buttercup: and just where will that get us. him:  not so easy, is it.  times running out. blossom: ooh, ooh. i know, i know. ms. keanes... who will the other ms. keane say is the real ms. keane.  keane 2: she would say that i was the real ms. keane. keane 1: and she would say that she was the real ms. keane. blossom: its so apparent. its obvious that the liar would say that the real ms. keane would say that the fake ms. keane is the real ms. keane. and conversely, the real ms. keane would say that the fake ms. keane would say she is the real ms. keane. so therefore, the real ms. keane is none other than... number two.  him:  shes right.  blossom: bring on the next riddle, evil dude. i'm smoking. him:  you think you're so smart.  then let's see how good you are on the sat's.  him: considering your educational level, you must collectively score

explanation as to how something that was destroyed can exist again.  brick: duh. nice hat, dorko.  mojo: how dare you talk to your father that way.. rowdyruff boys: father..  him:  yes, it seems that the boys have a new father now. mojo: what.. him: i brought the boys back, so i am their father now. mojo: incorrect. the rowdyruff boys were my idea, which means i was the original creator. yes, it was i who originally created them, which means it was i whose creativity led to the origin of the idea which resulted in the creation of them. therefore, the idea originated before the actual creating began, resulting in total origination of all creativity. brick:  yeah... i didn't get that the first time. can you repeat that.  him: i'm sorry, mojo. but your creation was destroyed by the powerpuff girls.  and would probably still be destroyed  if i didn't revive them. besides, seeing how i made them better, they should  remain mine. mojo: better.. how can you make mojo jojo's design of the rowdyruff boys any better..  him:  by making them immune to the powerpuff's girly kisses. now they can't be destroyed by the mere talk of cooties.  so why don't you run along, chimpchump..  mojo: those boys were created to do pure evil, which makes me the more fit father, since i am pure evil. him:  oh, i'm sorry. but nobody does evil  the way i do. mojo: that is not so. him:  is so. mojo: is not so. him: is so. mojo: is not. him: is so. mojo: is not. him: is so. mojo: is not. him:  is so. mojo: is not. him: is so. mojo: very well, then. since you will not acknowledge that i, mojo jojo, the original creator of the rowdyruff boys, who were originally created by me, and the more evil father, you leave me no alternative but to prove that i am the more evil father, therefore making me the better parent. him:  fine, then.  and i will prove that i am the evilest parent. mojo: very well, then. both:  let the evil begin. mojo jojo: behold. the trcp800. boomer: you mean "totally rad city pulverizer".  mojo jojo: no, dumdum.  mojo jojo: "the remotecontrol pickle". brick: you mean "we can blow things up and stuff. mojo: mmmhmm. brick: anything. mojo jojo: anything.  him:  splendidly evil,  isn't it. mojo jojo: evil.. how about stupid.. yes, thanks to your foolishness, we will be reduced to nothing. nothing. like the amount of intelligence inside your head. nothing. like the amount of respect i get after 6 seasons on this show...  mojo jojo: no, you are not the more evil parent. you are the more stupid parent, which makes you unfit to be the father of these boys. him:  is not so. mojo jojo: is so. him: not so. mojo jojo: is so. him: not so. mojo jojo: is so. him:  not so. rowdyruff boys: shut up... brick: we don't care which one of you is more eviler, or more stupider, or whateverer. there's only one evil thing we care about, and that's destroying the powerpuff girls. rowdyruff boys:  yeah. brick: let's go.  mojo jojo: my... that's the evilest thing i can imagine. him:  all you can do is raise them the best you know how, and hope they turn out right. mojo jojo and him:  i'm so proud of them.  narrator: and so, with mojo and him finally happy together, the day is doomed, thanks to... the rowdyruff boys. simian says  mojo jojo:  the city of townsville. a city that, while being a city, is for some inexplicable reason called "town." and not only is it called a "town," but also a "ville," thus making it a city, town, and village, which seems to me to be redundant and repetitive, which can be quite annoying if you ask me, which you have no choice but to do, for now i, mojo jojo, am in charge of... the city of townsville.   buttercup: in the stomach or in the face. mojo jojo: how about a third type of opinion.   blossom: something feels not right. bubbles: we beat up mojo... buttercup: and saved the day... blossom: but, what.   bubbles: hey, girls. look.  narrator: ow. oh, girls, thank goodness its you. i can finally end this nightmare. so once again the day is saved, thanks to the powerpuff girls. buttercup: i knew something was missing. blossom: goodnight, folks.  buttercup:  now what. narrator: er... could i have a ride home. bbs: of course. nuthin' special buttercup: huh. forget it. i ain't got no special skills. i ain't special. blossom: aww. buttercup, you may not have a special power. buttercup: but butbut nothin'. i thought i had a special power, but i don't. i thought i was special, but i'm not.. so there..  buttercup: what.. stick my tongue out.. you wanna see that again so you can copy that too.. well, here.  blossom: you can... buttercup: yeah, so. what's the big deal. i've always been able to do that. see.  see me, feel me, gnomey  bossman:  townsville's goin'down. i'm gonna throw this paper on the ground. the mayor:  the babies can grow, and the little old folks, can walk real sloooho. professor utonium:  do the people have to be freedom beef. the gnome:  as i descend to the earth, and i view the universe above me, i realize that life revolves, evolves, and dissolves, completely around the opposites. therefore, i conclude that i cannot exist in my utopian...  mind...  ) )
