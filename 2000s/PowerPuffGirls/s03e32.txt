you're not the only genius around here, blossom. but alas, what is genius. is it the sprouting forth of word from the subconscious. or is it simply an affect developed by the cunning of civilization. aw, man. she's worse than before. yeah, this blossom wants to smash our minds. professor: girls, your sandwiches are ready. here you go, girls. hunger of the body is but temporary. but the thirst for knowledge is eternal. wait a minute. you didn't think i'd notice.  i forgot the drinks.  silly me. i'll be right back. uh, and bring more sandwiches, please. and take your time. okay, i got it all

buttercup takes too long in the bathroom. seriously, what are you doing in there. hey, my hair doesn't look like this on its own. enough. who is boring now. bloss, wait. we're really sorry. yeah, we should have listened to you about oh. about leaving the professor's lab alone and stuff. analyzing apology. apology unaccepted. aah. aah.  i'll never call blossom boring again after this. that is
