i got this. oh, whoa. that was a doozy. bubbles, that was really dangerous. but we made our stop. it just seems like you might be getting a little carried away with that new arm. his name is armsie. whatever. armsie helps people. besides, he's the happiest dude around. does he look dangerous to you. hi, blossom. good job, armsie. you think bubbles ever listens to what she's saying. bubbles, just the girl i've been looking for. oh, hi, professor. do you need me and armsie to do something maybe dish ou some street justice. i saw a bunch of doors outside that weren't broken yet. actually, it's time for that cast to come off. what.. that's right. it's been six weeks. you're all healed. no. finally. things can get back to normal. and you can stop treating tha cast like it's a real friend. what.. i cannot believe what i am hearing today. armsie is my best friend. you can't take him away from me. ask yourselves, "what is friendship." ah, here we go. is it the ship atop the friend sea bouncing in the ocean over waves, saying hi to seagulls, solving mysteries. or is it a submarine, diving deeper and deeper into the sea of understanding, yet also still saying hi to seagulls, who are in their own submarine. and, furthermore bubbles, quit stalling. it's time to take that cast off. no. you're jealous. you're all jealous. that went well. i can't believe it. how can they do this. first, they tell me i'm too weak. and then i get armsie, and they tell me i'm too strong. then they tell me that i talk to myself too much. armsie's not dangerous. hey, free puppy. they're just jealous. they're just all wimpybutts. wimpybutts. wimpybutts. hey, bubbles. i am not a wimpybutt. no, rita. you can't break up with packrat. you are my love. huh. run, rita. save yourself. must get
