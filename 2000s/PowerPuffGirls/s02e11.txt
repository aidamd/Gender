 buttercup: thats mojo jojo, all right. blossom: yes. hes certainly outdone himself this time.  buttercup: here he comes. blossom: hold your ground. mojo:  boy.  this situation would be much more menacing if it were actually me in there    mojo: wouldnt it. blossom, buttercup: mojo jojo..  blossom: buttercup. wait.    buttercup: take this. and that. and some of this. and one of those. blossom: buttercup.  if mojo jojo is here, then he cant possibly be the one destroying townsville. buttercup: then who is in the robo jojo. mojo:  why dont you see for yourself.    blossom, buttercup: bubbles. narrator: bubbles.. mayor:  bubbles. talking dog: bubbles. crowd: bubbles. mojo: bubbles.    bubbles: i am not bubbles. bubbles is not who i am. i am the one, the only, single solitary doer of dastardly deeds. purveyor of pestilence. interloper of lawlessness. menace to mankind. i am bad. i am evil. i am mojo jojo.  mojo:  i do not talk like that. the way i communicate is much different. i do not reiterate, repeat, reinstate the same thing over and over again. i am clear, concise, to the point. i    buttercup: take this. and that. and some of this. and one of those.  blossom: what kind of evil have you bestowed upon our sister. mojo:  youve got to be kidding. im wet. im naked. your sister is wearing my clothes. and this is all part of some evil plotto rule the world as a soggy chimp in my birthday suit.. blossom: buttercup, i dont think mojo is behind this one. that bonk to bubbles head must have led her to believe that she is mojo jojo. mojo:  no. really. do you think.    bubbles: enough of this tomfoolery. cease and desist. and furthermore, shut up. blossom: okay, bubbles. quit monkeying around. this isnt funny. bubbles:  for the last time, i am not bubbles. i am  mojo jojo.    narrator: uhoh. bubbles done a bad thing.    buttercup: blossom, wait. shes our sister. blossom: yeah, but that really hurt. buttercup: i know, i know. but two wrongs dont make a right. she hits you, you hit her. suddenly were all hitting each other, then well all be right back where we started. bubbles: whats the matter, buttercup. fraid ill whup the skirt off you.    buttercup: all right, lets kick her butt.    blossom: no, buttercup. youre right. she is our sister. and as sisters, we have an intrinsic duty    blossom:  to uphold peace. not only for the city of townsville, but amongst ourselves. buttercup:  whyd i have to open my big trap.  bubbles: enough of this chatter. its time to meet your maker.  blossom, buttercup: you leave the professor out of this.        mojo: right on. we did it.  we finally destroyed the powerpuff girls. now there is no one to stop us.  hand in hand, we can work together. we can rule the world. just you and me, bubbles.    bubbles: im not bubbles. bubbles is not my name. for the name bubbles is not a correct name to address me by, because it is not my name.  if you were to address me by the name mojo jojo, that would be correct. for my name is mojo jojo.  and i will only be addressed by that name, which is mojo jojo.  and furthermore, it is not we who will rule the world, it is i.    bubbles:  i, being mojo jojo, who is not bubbles  shall rule this world alone, which is to say, without anybody else.  and without anybody else shall i rule this world.    bubbles:  and when this world is ruled by only one person, and not a collective group  that one person who shall be ruling the world will be none other than me.  mojo jojo.    mojo: oh, shut up.      mojo: thats all just well enough, because in reality there is only room enough in this world for one mojo jojo. one shall be the number of mojo jojos in the world, and the number of mojo jojos in the world shall be one. two mojo jojos is too many, and three is right out. so the only mojo jojo there is room for in the world shall be me.    mojo: and being the only mojo jojo in the world, i will rule the world in which there is only one mojo jojo..    bubbles: what. what happened.      bubbles: theres only one evildoer in the world who could have done this to townsville. and thats    bubbles:  mojo jojo.      buttercup:  look. blossom: it looks like bubbles is back to her sweet old self again. buttercup: thats good. cause there certainly isnt enough room in the world for two mojo jojos. blossom: i heard that. narrator: yeah, yeah, so did we, about a million times. we get it already.    narrator: and so once again the day is savedthanks to mojo bubbluhthethe powerpuffah, heck, the day was saved. so says me, the narrator.  so called because i speak the narrative of the story. i advance the plot. i begin and end each episode of powerpuff girls. me. the narrator. ) )
