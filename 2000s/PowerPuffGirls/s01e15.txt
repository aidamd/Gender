ohh, yeah. powerpuff girls fighting crime to save the world before bedtime here's the time to shine when you're fighting crime power it up who's got the power. we got the power breaking through the wall, gonna do it all we don't quit who's got the power. we got the power oh. yeah.  geez, bloss, if you gotta take a leak, just take the pass and go. buttercup, i don't have to go. i'm just excited. today's the day that dr. kensington ph. d is coming to talk to us about the science fair. who's on the what now. dr. rupert kensington, ph. d. he's only the biggest scientist in the entire western hemisphere. and he's gonna guest teach our class. maybe he can help us prove the existence of the ghost horse. you mean the one that haunts this very school. they say at night, you can hear him clipclopping down the hallways. it's both scary  and adorable. please. that's ridiculous. oh. here he comes. good day, everyone. as some of you may already be aware, my name is miste err doctor dr. rupert kensington, ph. d. why, yes. that's me. uh, and as you may also know, i'm very famous for scienceing. why why, i singlehandedly created the uh, the, uh oh. the transmutation ray. i've read all of your books on it. boring. no. don't you see. using his transmutation ray, he infused carrot dna into a grapefruit to create a carrotfruit. still boring. aas you know, i'll be teaching your class this week, and  "and".. there's an "and".. i will be judging your science fair next week and and.. and awarding this, uh, prestigious, er, blue ribbon to the student with the most impressive science fair project.  er, anyway, i hope to be impressed. i hear some minds here are rather sharp. he's talking about me.  i know what project will blow everyone's minds. "the ghost horse. "  fact or very true fact.. uh, bubbles. i agree, blossom. this is literally the best idea i've ever heard. both:  ghost horse. ghost horse. ghost horse. ghost horse. rupert: blossom, may i have a word. as many as you like, sir. ah, have you given any thought yet as to what you might do for your science fair project. oh, yes. i've been compiling a list of multiple projects for months, such as a baking soda volcano. a bit simple, don't you think. you're right. tornado tube. no. ant farm derby. no. papiermch brain. no. cold fusion.. no, thanks, i already ate. i was thinking of something more along the lines of this. a blueprint for a genuine transmutation ray. yes. but perhaps it's time for an upgrade something that will mutate not just plants, but animals or even humans. you could make, for example, peoplesheep, or sheep people, or uh, what do you call 'em. sheeple. that's the one. while that does sound like an amazing idea, sir, wouldn't it be dangerous. ah. true, true. but, sometimes, you have to do dangerous things for the good of society. that's how hang gliding was invented. not to mention, a project like that would certainly be worthy of the blue ribbon award.  yes. and the person who made it would even be worthy of being my assistant.  or, dare i say, my lab partner.  but maybe you're not up to the challenge. yes, i am. excuse me, dr. kensington, i have some groundbreaking work to break ground on.   ms. keane: i'd like to welcome everyone to this year's science fair. let's get on with the judging. hmm no. no. mm, unhunh. hmm. ghost horse. yeah. that's right. hit the lights. the ghost horse is real, people. haven't you all noticed how messy it is. the janitor's not been doing his job because he's been ghostnapped.  and we've tracked his ghost prints from the boiler room where the janitor hangs out right to the office of dr. rupert kensington, ph. d.  where are you hiding the ghost horse, huh. i, uh well, i  okay i think that's enough with the crazy talk. let me show you some real science. this thing didn't end with roswell, it started with roswell. i'm so sorry about my sisters, sir. that's quite all right. now, let's see your project. i'm very excited about it.  me, too. i give you the transmutator 2. 5. hmm allow me to demonstrate.  as you'll see in this simulation, i can use the transmutator to combine the dna of a human with any animal. like so well, that's nice, but that's just a doll. would this machine work on real animals and real people. yes, of course.  good.  whawhat. dr. kensington.. i am not dr. kensington.  it's the janitor. i'd prefer if you called me by my real name  janitaur. whew. that takes some serious core strength. oh, and he's a centaur, apparently. wwhat. how is this possible. allow us to explain. according to our research, the ghost horse started appearing after the science fair explosion of 1992. during which, the student who caused the explosion, wendell feinstein the most careless student in school disappeared. sometime later, a new janitor was hired a janitor with a posterior most superior. what. he had a giant butt. that dude's the real ghost horse. thanks for the introduction, girls. now to unleash my plan, and make all of you halfanimal freaks like me. why didn't you just have me build a machine to make you human again.  oh. why didn't i think of that. most careless student.  eep. oh, my gosh. they're so cute. ahh. huh. i'm a bee. yay. i'm a bee. bubbs, no. aah.  wow. awesome a flamingo.  hey. whoa. watch out. oh, boy. excuse me. okay, janitaur, time to bring down the hammer. hyah. help me. i'm dr. kensington the real dr. kensington. wait.you're the real dr. kensington. oh, my gosh. i can't believe it's really you. sir, i just want to say aah. dr. kensington. i will avenge thee in the name of science.  oof.  and now to turn all of townsville into freaks like me. ort, ort. bubbles, buttercup, stop him. oh, yeah hello. i'm here to bug you.  ugh, gross. stop it. go away.  quit it. knock it off.  grrrrr. stop it.      huh.  both: we did it. it doesn't matter. there's no way to reverse the effects now.   blossom: or is there.. you forgot, i'm an ortver achiever.  whoa, sweet.  you.you. that's right. i knew the ray was too dangerous, so i built a second device to reverse the effects. no. when you get a chance, could you sweep this mess up. thanks.  and so the winner of the science fair and blue ribbon award goes to aw. i don't deserve to win. bubbles and buttercup.  aw. i kind of thought i was still gonna win. bubbles and buttercup's project was not only proven through ahem a form of scientific method, it also didn't compromise their scientific integrity. i couldn't agree more, doctor kensington, ph. d. but is this really the end of the mystery. or is this not the real dr. kensington, either. er, what..  guys, stop. buttercup: remove your mask, imposter. rupert: i'm not an imposter.  stupid science.  ) )
