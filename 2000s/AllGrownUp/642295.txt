"pee here".    philip, this is hardly my idea of...   tranquillity.   what do you think, ms. o.  it looks like an... like an...  outhouse.  in our tranquillity garden.  o'keats: how could you confuse a meditation hut with a latrine..  i just followed grandpa's instructions.  uhoh, i get it: the bathroom's where he spends his time, uh... meditating.   put a lid on it.  trying to watch tv here.  i told you to keep it down.  your roommate's trying to sleep.  what about my needs.  i can't even hear my show because, oh, miss moansalot.  your dessert.  oh, and you have a visitor.  i do.  why didn't you tell me.  it's time for you to go home.  oh, it's just you.  i said you worried too much about how you look, but, girl, do you have any idea how you look.  five... four... three... two...   okay, so i've looked better.  it's a good thing i'm here.  you need to get over yourself and give up your bed to someone who really needs it.  break out the violins.  look, when i have a bad hair day, i'll wear a hat.  i don't drop off the planet until my ends unsplit.  did it ever occur to you people might like you for who you are.  okay, but you get my point.  you do things your way, i'll do the smart, efficient way with no hassle.  so you're going to hang out here forever.  what do you care.  because we're friends.  so that's why you came by.  well, that and to give you this.  homework..

savannah's so upset her mood bracelet's turning black.  uh, what can i say. i'm... devastated.  harold, why don't we have a little talk.  why would you want to talk to me.  i'm just so concerned about angelica.  is she feeling better.  how should i know.  she's very, very secluded in... seclusion.  oh, poor angelica, in seclusion simply because she doesn't want anyone to see her... feet.  not feet, her nose.  oh, thanks, harold.  for what.  what did i just do..  girls:  for she's a jolly good fellow    for she's a jolly good fellow    for she's a jolly good fellow...   poor, poor angelica.  i

wrong with people around here.  this is hospital, not a library.  there's got to be something to do here.   hey, there's that kid i was nice enough to read to.  the clown's back.   i'm not a clownget over it.  boy: hey...  you look different.  yesterday you were mean and in a hurry.  today you look mean and kind of crazy.  what happened.  i broke my nose. why.  you look like you need someone to play with.  yeah, well...  you got any cards.  sorry.  i'm spencer.  i'm busy.  oh. okay.  you still following me.  no.  i'm angelica.  so, what are you in for.  i got a new kidney recently.  you did.

 missed a whole little league season.  wow, that's a long time... i think.  did your nose make you miss anything good.   no, not really.  i'm glad.  hey, you still got that book.  i'll read it to you if you want.  the whole story.  the whole enchilada.  you trying to make me look as bad as you.  i don't think that's possible.  yeah, you're right.    where's angelica..  woman: gone... finally.  gone..   as in she left.  oh.  thank you, thank you, thank you.  o'keats: oh... you see, all our efforts were not for naught.  i do "naught" understand a word she says.  sit ye down, children.  let's drink the tranquillity.   sweet silence.  we couldn't have picked a more perfect spot.      the end.  you're kind of nice for a crazylooking girl.  well, you're kind of crazy for a nicelooking kid.  thanks for reading to me, angelica.  anytime, spence.   except now.  angelica.  i know.  hide me.  hi, harold.  why are you standing in front of that food cart...  that has feet.  i'm not.  hey, guys, what's up.  oh, we wanted to see how you were feeling.    savannah: your nose.  and hair and dress and shoes.  uh...  oh, yeah.  i fainted when i found out my brain was melting.  okay, how about "it's the latest look from paris".  paris.  she's a party clown.  can everyone just let that one go.  .. i...  okay... here's the deal: my brain's not melting.  i just didn't want anyone seeing me like this.  so you lied to us..  yep, but that was before i found out there are a lot worse things that can happen than missing a party or not looking good or even a broken nose.  brianna: you're so right, angelica.  once i used my mom's exfoliate and it turned my complexion from tawny beige to beige bisque.  anyway, you can all go to savannah's party now.  make fun of me all you want.  okay.  actually, i don't blame her for not wanting to be seen.  i wouldn't have gone to the party either.  howard: the brain melt idea was way genius.  mind if i borrow the melt to get out of my brother's piano recital.  uh... sure.  hey, we brought all this stuff for a partywe might as well have one.  sorry, i'm late, but i stopped to get something.  girl, that's better for everyone.  okay, this has been cute.  now let's go to my place and have a real party.  but it's fun here.   is that another stripe.  fancy that.  can i sign your nose.  sure.  spencer: leave room for me.   captioning sponsored by
