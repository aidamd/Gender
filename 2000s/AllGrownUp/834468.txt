 uals that of force times mass.  hence, a beach ball has less acceleration than, say a...  bowling ball.  uh, phil...   all: run.   you forgot newton's first law.  tommy's dad is gonna kill us.   do you have to keep doing that.  just turn on the tv, honey.  oops.  darn. broke another one.     lil : nice backpack, tommy.  beats the thermos she knitted me.  it's 9:00. what are you doing eating lunch.  it feels like lunch... to me.  i got here at 4:00 this morning.  i even helped karl wax the floors.  why, phillip, you look so wan.  if that means bad, i am.  i'm losing it, man.  last night, i had the scariest dream.  i was a shrunken head ongallegos island.  definitely subconscious anxiety.  better known as the tvdt's.  what's this look like to you.  i hate smart chuckie.  come on, guys, we can make it without tv.  i know we can.   shh.  i hear a television from in there.  kimi.  relax, charles.  what do you think i'm going to do.  geesh, chill.  karl: yeah.  hi. it's kimi finster.  i, uh, need toilet bowl cleaner.  some what.  a dry erase board.  my teacher sent me.  karl: go away.  i know you have a tv in there.  i need to watch it. i need to watch it very, very badly.  15 minutes.  i'll never bug you again.  i want in.  weakling.  i haven't had one urge to watch tv.  how much gum are you up to now.  like, ten sticks of it.  anytime somebody just mentions tv, boops, another stick goes in. it's like she's addicted, or something.  i am not addicted.  i can quit anytime.  i am about two seconds from being an only child.  what can you do to me that's worse than being a head kabob.  open the door, karl.  i can't take it anymore.  i'm freaking, man.  guys, we've come this far.  we can't let our parents break us now.  it'll be a lot easier if we get away from tv.  backyard camping.  my house, tonight.  isn't this better.  just us and the world around us.  hey, check it outthe north star.  see.  judging from its position, it's precisely 8:00 o'clock.  you know what that means.  dumb tricks that can get you killedis on.  ooh, ooh, did you see that episode where the guy was locked in a box of live bats.   i think bats are way cool.  you want to know creepy.  uh, guys.   anyone ever seen that special on alien crop circles.   yeah, like there's such things as aliens.  which brings to my mind that program,my uncle the martian.  it continues to be amusing without being derivative.  i actually heard my brain crack that time.  speaking of time, remember that episode ofthose wacky webers where jermaine gets his watchband stuck on that girl's sweater.   what was that he said that was so funny.   icht bin laben mein kopf.   that's it.  i can't take it anymore.  we've got to get tv back.  stitch one, purl two... morning.  morning.  and you're sure your mind control stuff will really work on dad.  i got him to call the fire department telepathically that time, didn't i.  that small grease fire in the oven didn't hurt either.  hmm.  let me get you some milk, dad.  hmm.  dil: french toast, dad.  don't forget the cinnamon sticks.   so dad, how's thatevening newsfrench toast.  uh... good.  better thanbig football gamepancakes.  yeah, i guess.  dil, you gonna finish yourinane game showeggs.  listen, tv... i mean, didi, i'm really beginning to miss a television in this house.  i suppose it couldn't hurt having one for special events.  on second thought, no tv ever.  but, mom, there's nothing to do.  not true.  without that mindless boob tube, we finally have the time to add some culture to this family.  four tickets to the opera.   that's it.  mom's going down.  this isn't funny anymore.  we need tv.  i think we can take your mom, tommy.  she's scrappy, but there's only one of her.  if we're gonna scam my mom, we're gonna have to step it up a notch.  we need to think like our parents.  well, statistics show parents tend to work from a place of fear.  so what do parents fear most.  dirt in the house.  gum in the car.  low density lipo proteins.  what. that's a bad cholesterol.  my mom always says bad things happen when kids have too much time on their hands.  are you thinking what i'm thinking.  gosh, i hope not.  we do something stupid and dangerous that only kids with too much time on their hands would do, and our folks will be begging us to watch tv.  we can make homemade fireworks.  or papiermch phil into a mummy.  a human sacrifice.  no, that's just cool.  i'm thinking a tall tree and the world's longest zip line.   what's a zip line.  working with gravity, the subject is strapped into a rappeler's harness and attached by a carabiner to the taut line of a stainless steel aircraft cable.  in english.  it's one of those handle bar thingies you hang onto and swing across on a rope.  now did it kill you to say that.  here's the deal.  we build a rickety platform way up on that spindly limb, string a somewhat frayed rope over to that other tree, where the guy drops off into our halffinished swimming pool.  that is the stupidest thing i've ever heard.  it's perfect.  uh, query.  who is said "guy" who is allegedly taking the plunge.  why me.  because the youngest always has to do the stupid pranks.  what can i say.  when you're right, you're so wrong.  don't worry, dil, mom will shut it down long before you ever step foot off that poorly constructed, seemingly unstable platform.  color me dubious, but i guess it's worth the risk.  it's embarrassing going to bed before the sun does.  what are we waiting for.  let's build us this piece of junk.   phil: ow.  ow.  phil: ow.  too straight.  perfect.  chuckie, what is all that.  i'm designing a viewing platform so we can observe the action.  that's never gonna happen, right.  i thought this was gonna be a pain, but i'm actually having fun.  me too. yeah.  i'd be whooping it up, too...  if only the universe had granted me a younger brother.   you're preaching to the choir, my furry friend.    tommy : argh.     this place is so cool, i could live up here.  yeah, it's fierce.  it rocks.  uh, actually, it doesn't.  with a grade of .00001, it's well within the industry standard.  i'm now scared of youandfor you.  well, guess it's time for us to put the rest of our plan into effect.  oh, yeah, the plan.  dil, climb out to the plank and grab the handlebar.  just for show, right, tommy.  right.  and i'll go grab some cushions to break the fall just in case you miss the pool.   good... what..  to alarm mom.  because it's not happening, right, tommy.  right..  right.  oh, sorry, i stepped on your, uh...  house cozy.  knit one, purl two, knit one and reduce...  let's see.  i need something to use for padding.  ah, couch cushions.  couch cushions...  that i'm using for padding...  next to the tree fort...  wayup in the tree.  where's mom..  i don't know.  i thought i was being really obvious.  well, be obviouser.  don't mind me.  just taking this out in case we need more padding.  it's a pretty big drop from that plank, if you know what i mean.  hey, mom, mind if i use your physician certified first aid kit for emergencies only.  darn.  dropped a stitch.  great.  'cause it'll come in handy for the massive contusions dil's gonna get when he zip lines 50 feet off the ground and drops into the halfempty pool.  do you think i should knit room for rain gutters.   is that what i think it is..  yes, it's a first aid kit.   which you won't need because you're not even gonna pretend to jump because mom doesn't seem to care what we do.  i guarantee you, if she had the tv on, she would have heard every word.  pardon me, thomas, but...  chillax.  i told phil to go down and keep a look out for my mom.  i thought you said lil.     knit one, purl two, knit one...   zip line..  didi: tommy pickles.   dil, stay in position.   didi: get down here right this instant.  this has to be the single stupidest thing you have ever done.  dil, i want you on the ground now.  trust me, mom, we all want the same thing.   woo hoo.  that was wicked awesome.  can i go again..  it was completely safe.  my head barely touchedthe bottom.  chuckie, this show is lame, see what else is on.  no can work clicky thing.  he's back.  you know, guys, this is really boring.   huh.  anybody up for hanging out in the tree fort.   captioned bymedia access group at wgbh access.wgbh.org television. i have to have some television.  television. i have to have some television.  i have to have some television, television.  i got to have some television.   2 h8yhrphxp8.#he9h8p8yh8p8yh8p8yh8p8yh 0: 0: 0: p 0: hj 0: hjpr0: p0: p0: 8x(]:x/ 0p :x/ xpxx/ hxpxx/ hxpxx/ hxpxx/ . every birthday,my mom and dad would say .  . you're another year older,another year wiser .  . but i still go to school, to get an education .  . i treat eachand every day .  . like a mini vacation .  .all grown up.  . i really wantto shout it out .  .all grown up.  . i want the world to know .  .all grown up.  . i really want to shout it out .  .all grown up.  . with you .  . all grown up with... you. .  captioning sponsored bymtv television networks boy:now can you hear me.   now can you hear me.   now can you hear me..

"n" is for... now can you hear me.  knock it off, already.  call me crazy, but doesn't"knock" start with a "k".   that's what phonesused to sound like.  do you mind.  we're trying topractice something for our parents' tenthanniversary party.  so. practice at home.  :yeah.  this is a history class.   even the tower of babel was quieter.  i mean, look at this place.     i didn't call you. did you call me.  i know i didn't call you.  you must have called me.  now can you hear me.  now can you hear me.  now can you hear m mom.  stop calling me at school.  hold on, i got another call.  dad.  you got to stop calling me at school.  speaking of babbling towers, got to run.  halt.  you promised you'd practice this poem.  and you owe meor do i need to remind you of this morning's disgusting incident.  hey, i already apologized for leaving my underwear hanging from the bathroom doorknob.  i made waffles.  the frozen kind.  now, sit.  okay, okay.   hi.  my battery just died.  can i borrow your cell.  i don't have one.  really.  gee, i thought everyone did.  sorry.    kimi: cell phones are totally about status, nothing else.  i thought you wanted one.  do noteven if my dad would let me have one.  hold on, i'm getting another call.   hello.  no, i didn't call you  did you call me.  i mean, look at that.  it's getting out of control.  so stop yammering and do something about it.  like what.  no one will listen to just me.  uhhuh.  uhhuh. uhhuh.  nuhuh.  start a petition to have them banned.  other schools have outlawed them.  it's the heart of the democratic process.  at least that's what i learned in government class...   ...between cell phones ringing.  a petition.  that's a great idea.  plus, i can have flyers printed up stating the anti cell phone position, set up a table in the cafeteria for signups, wear a really cute outfit...  chuckie: it's great you're putting together this little movie for my parents' anniversary, tommy.  it's going to be the highlight of the party.  it'll be cool arranging all the photos into a small film, and a way to challenge my storytelling instincts.  glad to hear you say that.  and the good news is, there'll be plenty of material to work with.  good luck.  oh, and by the way, i got to have it by friday.  see you.   they're totally about showing off and nothing else.    oh. oh. oh.  ooh. ooh, check this out.   wasn't that outfit hideous.   hey.  over my dead body.  this puppy is brand new and stateoftheart.  i'm not giving it up just because a few insensitive kids are using it as a status symbol.  besidesduhthat's the point.  what i'm doing is completely fair.  all i have to do is get 250 signatures to pass a resolution in the school charter.  250 signatures, eh.  save the cell phones.  save the cell phones.  save the cell phones.  save the cell phones.  you.  huh.  sign this petition before my life...  err, i mean, ourlives are ruined.  no way.  you still owe me for the homework i let you copy back in sixth grade.  so let it go already.  sign up and save the cell phones.  but that was in preschool.  what do you think you're doing.  practicing democratic ideals.  there's always an opposing point of view, and i represent it.  you'll never get the signatures you need.  no one trusts you.  a lot you know.  this issue is near and dear to plenty of hearts.  hearts like...  theirs.  just set your john hancocks down right here before our lives are ruined.  not a chance.  same here.  don't you realize that if she gets her way, it's good bye to cell phones.  let's face it, angelica, you've burned too many bridges.  dissed too many people.  you're worse than...  us.  we figure we're safe so long as we exercise our right not to sign either petition.  apathyisa vote.  whatever that means.   hey, kimi, how about going over the poem now.  i feel bad about the whole underwearonthedoorknob snafu, and...  forget it.  we have a school to save.  dude, did you see the game last night.  ooh, wait.   and not soon enough.  here, one of these needs to go into everyone's locker by lunch.  but...  by lunch.  now can you hear me.  now can you hear me.    well, if it isn't the messenger boy.  what do you want.  i'm so glad you asked.  i need you to be the face of the pro cell phone petition drive.  why me.  i've never done anything to distinguish myself.  hardly anyone even knows who i am.  perfect.  you're a blank slate, no baggage.  besides, i asked everyone else and they said no.  i don't think so.  i mean, kimi's so into banning cell phones.  she thinks it's a really good idea.  so it's all about what kimi wants, is it.  but what do you want.  or do you want what you think kimi wants you to want.  yes.  i mean, no.  i mean, uh...  could you repeat that.  isn't it time you were your own man instead of crawling around on your hands and knees doing your sister's bidding.  i am not crawling.  okay, i was, but i am not now.  word of warning, my friend: unless you take a stand now, someday soon you'll find yourself standing outside kimi's dressing room holding a bra for her to try on.  by then it'll be too late to step out of her shadow.  a bra..  walk with me.  thank you.  uh, you can keep the pen.  chuckie: save the cells.  sign up today.   save the cells.  sign up today.  i can't believe it.  "save the cells." my own brother..  since when are you pro cell phone.  i'm not.  i mean, not necessarily.  i just don't want my sister telling me what i don't want... to want.  talk to my adviser.   you're bind this.  guilty.  you were right.  my face was the wrong one for this petition, but not chuckle's.  that blank canvas has already gotten us 245 signaturesonly five shy of winning.  that's impossible.  i've been at this for days, and i've only gotten 94 signatures.  "acilegna selkcip." i don't know any selkcips.  sure you do.  she's that girl from, uh... turkey.  "lid and ymmot selkcip." cousins.  wait a minute...  that's "angelica pickles" backwards.  i knew it. )
