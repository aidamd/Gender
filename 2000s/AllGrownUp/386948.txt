   where are we going.  platzmackinoff: where better to have outerspace camp than in space.    huh.   dad.  what are you doing.  i was almost asleep when it came to me: why stop at socks.  why couldn't we expand our device to sort shoes, earrings, glovesanything..   "our".  "we".   yes, honey for honey nut cheerios will finally be mine.  not if i can help it, yellow jacket.  keep him busy boys i don't think so.  ugh. mmmmmm. ugh. yummy. yummy.  get that honey yeeeeeeeeeeeet.   the honey is safe this time...  ...for honey nut cheerios.  part of this good breakfast.  ]now shrek squirters...   haha...  and markers.  inside thesespecially marked boxes.  eight in all.  shrek forever after.  ]that's gogurt.  okay, who is shrek's best friend.  donkey.let's see.  ready for shrek forever after.  with foldtoreveal gameson 16 tubes of gogurt, prove you'rethe ultimate shrek fan.  ugh.  lil nabbed nicholas as her science project partner.  oh, she's so lucky.   ew.  ow.  ew. ew.  yes.  bull'seye.  did you get it.  no... i didn't see a thing.  whoa.  you are, like, one of those camera geniuses.  or something.  ew.  uh... yeah.  maybe i should take the pics and you should do the spitballing.  okayaim for the one who looks like me, only way ugly.   it was such a rush to see my design working.  now i totally understand how my dad feels when he makes a breakthrough.  and, thanks to your invention, i now know how it feels to be fully men'swearcoordinated.  nice try, you guys, but i'm not falling for your notsoclever ruse to intimidate me into dropping project reekorama.  yeah, phil, that was my evil plan.  anyway, it's been a total blast working with my dad on my project, but, uh, you guys don't see anything wrong with him helping, do you.  well, it was your idea, right.  yeah.  you did the real work.  yeah.  i don't see one. you.  heck no.  where would i be without a little help from my friend, mr. bacterium.  hey...  thanks for the saliva sample.   tommy: dad.  what happened to my...  heyheyhey, champ, just in time for the first test run.         stu: hey, hey... whoa.   wow.  maybe i really have lost my touch.  nah, no way, dad.  ii think it shows promise.  really.  hey, what ifwe attach something to help regulate the centrifugal force, like...  maybe a lazy susan.  yeah, but where are we going...  mom has one.  you mean the good silver one she guards like fort knox treasure.  yeah, that one.  we couldn't.  could we.  project's on permahold otherwise.  lil: ergo, from this data, we broke down the reactions according to social group and concluded that...  absolutely everyone hated being spitballed.  cool.  no, not cool.  it means we didn't prove anything.  well, so what.  we got to spitball a bunch of kids in the name of science.  that rocks.  nicholas, you seriously have to take this seriously.  with that seriously bad stench.   oh... has your father been cooking with slovakian cheese again.    phil: what are you doing.   i cultured them from mold under the kitchen sink, leftovers from the fridge, andmy favorite so farlil's gym socks.    i'll take care of that.  you should get to bed.  but we have to work on it together.  we're a team, remember.  sure we are.  just making a few adjustments.  it's still your vision, right.  yeah.  : i guess.  should we go back to my original plan.  you know, keep it simple.  sure thing, tommy.  just minor tweaks.   okay, semimajor tweaks.  i've got to admit, nicholas on your arm does make a statement.  yeah, it says...  i'm hanging with a blithering idiot.  huh.  i've decided to drop the spitball project.  instead, i'm doing a case study on nicholas entitled, "the mind of the mindless." works for me.  kimi, i'm really sorry i blew you off.  i should have known better than to choose eyecandy over functioning brain cells.  no worries.  the player band was pretty much a bust anyway.  worked great once, but after that one big success, the instruments refused to play together again.  hmm. i'll take a look.  i work well with difficult things.  speaking of which, where is phil.  chuckie: they were worried his project could be infectious.  don't say "science project." not going well.  my dad started out helping, then pretty much took over.  i'm totally caught. i really want to win this thing, but...  why not just ask him to back off.  you should see him.  he's having so much fun.  andand it's a blast working with him.  i guess i just don't want to mess that up.  i know what you mean.  my dad still hasn't gotten over the day i told him i could button my own shirt.  ugh.    do something.   i can't.  i don't know howit's not mine.  it's not mine.  it's not mine.  it's not mine...  i have to tell him.   hey, dad.  can we talk.  what's up, slugger.  ready for your big day.  um, well... about the sciencepalooza.  you know my original plan for the socksomatic.  sure do.  pure genius.  wait till you see it now.  that's what we should talk about.  i finished it.  wasn't easy, but it was worth it.  we're going to win.  stu pickles is back.  hing maniacally) who says i've lost it.  uh... no one.  hey, tommy, you okay.  uh, just a little tired.  oh, my, tommy.  i had no idea you were doing something so elaborate.  neither did i.  mom. uh...  new look.  someone took the motor out of my hair dryer and absconded with my shoes.  i'm innocent.  guilty.  uh, we don't want to be late.  i promise, deed, my absconding days are over.   starting now.   tommy: whoa...  weirdness abounds.   i rest my case.   ew. ew.  all: ew...  wow, i can't believe phil actually outweirded dil.  come on, tommy, why don't we get this party started.    i can't believe we actually pulled it off.  yeah, thanks to your lastminute mondo help.  and without even compromising my ultrarevealing project.    hi.  uh...  light's better over here.  uh... okay.  anyway...  i just came by to tell you what an idiot i am.  you know, for not taking our experiment seriously.  oh... that.  yeah, i kind of only proposed it because i thought you seemed happening and i wanted to hang.  so, sorry.  really.  tight.  uh, i mean, that's cool.  uh... let's dance.     teacher: tommy pickles.  if any other kid had entered a masterpiece like this, i would have suspected foul play.  mr. beaker, the truth is, i didn't make...     do something.   i'm trying, but it'sine.  of course it's not your fault, tommy.  people shouldn't get too close to a delicate machine.    it's the time we've all been waiting for: the naming of this year's sciencepalooza winner.   here to make the announcement, i'm proud to introduce my friend and colleague, major svetlana platzmackinoff.    and her dog.  platzmackinoff: and the winner is...  : not me, not me, not me...  tommy pickles.   what..  that stinks.  all: thatstinks.  you did it, tommy.  you won.  didn't you hear.   audience: speech. speech. speech.  speech. speech. speech.  uh...  i'm very proud of my sciencepalooza project, but... that isn't it.   i got help creating the sorter.  maybe a little too much help.  my invention just does socks.  so... i can't accept a prize i don't deserve.     i'm so proud.  uh, hi, dad.  i'm sorry.  but at the last second i just couldn't do it.  i hope you're not too disappointed.  but you could have gone to outerspace camp.  we won.  no, dad,youwon.  and it wasn't supposed to be "we," it was supposed to be... me.  but you asked for my help.  and i wanted it, but even though you didn't mean to, you took over.  i just wanted it to be the best project i...  i just said "i," didn't i.  i know i should have said something sooner, but i didn't because working with you was some of the best fun i've ever had.  in fact, i have some ideas for our next father/son project.  sorry i got so carried away, sport.  i didn't mean to.  i bet your socksomatic would have won.  yeah, considering the new winner's project stunk.  phil: just thinka solid week of outerspace camp.  all thanks to my prizewinning "ode to lil deville."    ah...  platzmackinoff: mr. pickles.  both: right here.   you call me tomorrow.  my cosmonaut comrades and i have been looking for machine to sort rocketengine parts.  who knows difference between bolt and nut.  i send you postcard from outerspace camp.  come, trotsky.  ) didi: oh...  that round silver thing on top of the sorter looks a lot like my good lazy sus...  stu.  tommy.  didi: oh.  captioning sponsored by the u.s. department of educationxzbpxfxb i(] p(].hpl girl:four, three, two, one.    every birthday,my mom and dad would say    "you're another year older,another year wiser"    but i still go to school    to get an education    i treat each and every day    like a mini vacation    all grown up.    i really wantto shout it out    all grown up.    i want the world to know    all grown up.    i really want to shout it out    all grown up    with you    all grown up with...    you.   captioning sponsored by the u.s. department of education and nickelodeon you're running for what..  safety commissioner.  and why are youdoing this.  my whole life, safety has beenlike a loony uncle locked away in the attic.  it's time i let himinto the house.  i've got pretty good odds, toothe only other candidateis amelia somebody.  she is so quiet,no one knows who she is.   see, this is just the kind of accident that could easily have been avoided.  having chuckie as safety comish is like jumpinginto a shark tank wearing a meat suit.  i think the pursuit of safetyis a noble cause.  how's your thumb.  somebody get a crowbar and some butter.  stu: what's the holdup.  izzy overslept.  i thought the kids weren't allowed to have friends stay over on school nights.  izzy's a different kind of friend... stop that.  different how.  he's dil's new imaginary alien friend, and according to chapter seven of my book, i found it's best to encourage the existence of such friends.  dil: sorry so late.  izzy couldn't decide what to wear.  you know, first day, new school.  oh, dad, this is izzy.  izzy, dad.  uh... nice to meet you.  buckle up, you two.  i'm already in.  i wasn't talking to you.   chuckie: "vote for finstera safe bet." it's kind of creepy.  and this is me as "safety boy." do you really want to advertise that you own tights.  lil: "chuckie finster wants to protect you." i like it.  what happened to you.  oh, an old thirdgrade seesaw injury.  would i lie to you, iz.  i love the smell of msg.  tommy, who is your brother talking to.  phil: hey.  making room for izzy.  who's izzy.  my new friend.  oh, of the imaginary varietyas in he's carbonically challenged.  how you doing, iz.  how's life.  i'm right there with you.   oh, thank you, izzy.  i didn't know i was having a good hair day.  hey, you want to hang at the mall later.  oh, he can'the's shooting hoops with us.  righ phil: what.  lil's breath smells like feet.  oh, izzy, that's just harsh.  check you later, iz.  lil: nice meeting you.  keep itreal, izzy.  uh, a little advice, dil: having an imaginary friend after a certain age is something one should keep to one's self.  i'm down with that, safety boy.  i put the "imaginary friend" thing to bed when i was eight.  izzy's my imaginary alienfriend.  dudes, we're short one guy.  no, we got izzy.  well, where is he...  izzy.  your guess is as good as anyone's.  he's dil's imaginary alien friend.   sean wants izzy on his team.  grunting) hands up, izzy.  sweet.  it's all yours, izzy.  what.   you the man, iz.    girl: don't forget izzy.  izzy, up top.   the name's finster, and i'm running for...  sean's team just scored again.   thanks to izzy.  kids: izzy. izzy. izzy.  could you move.  we can't see izzy.  who can..  izzy. izzy. izzy.  well, which one's izzy.  oh, you can't see him, but you know he's there.   kids: izzy. izzy. izzy.  izzy. izzy. izzy.  this is wicked fun.  we should invite izzy to the party friday night.  i wonder if he has a date to the fall formal.  yo, dil, you and izzy want to swing it to my place for food.  can'ti have a private yoga lesson.  but izzy wants to go. sweet.  come on, izzyisam, izzym'hizzy.  i knew i'd have to let him go one day.  how else is he going to learn to stand on his own two imaginary feet.  i'd love to go to your party.  let me guess...  it's for izzy.  oh, i see there's some confusion about the notpassingnotesinstudyhall rule.  but i'm happy to block out some time to clear it all up for you.  finster, izzyi'll see you both in detention.  seriously, chuckie, you are at a 12 and i need you at a two.  just chill.  how can i..  the election's monday, and i'll be spending my last available campaign
