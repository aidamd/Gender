 nskeep.  the kid who can peel the dead skin off his feet in one yank.  ooh. that's gross, even for you.  i'm talking about sean butler.  whoa. he askedyou.  yes, he just doesn't know it yet.  what's up with miss meanie dissing chuckman about nicole.  don't know.  hey, are you going to eat your carrot and redlicorice salad.  copy away, lil dil.  angelica: when i tell you to, beg me to go to the dance with you, and use those lines i gave you.  but i already told you i can't go with anyone.  i'm deejaying, and...  beg.  harold: "please, oh, please, "won't you...  "pleasego to the dance...  withme,angelica.." "get down on bended knee and..." not that part.  : you're the fifth boy who's asked me, and for the fifth time, no.  i'm waiting for the perfect guyone who's as good looking and as popular as i.  but who could it be.    yo.  hmm.  you're messing up the game.  is it me or is that kind of pathetic.  pretty bold wonk.  i've seen worse.  oh... .  that was angelica, too.  i'm glad i'm not bent about the dance.  me, too.  we are going as a group, right.  all for one, one for all.  i got to say i'm a little bummed about chuckie asking nicole.  it was supposed to be a whocaresaboutvalentine'sday night.  okay, this is going to sound pretty uncool, but i'm kind of hoping she turns him down.  did you hear that.  i didn't know tommy was into nicole.  last chance to change your mind.  nope.  i'm going to do this, tommy.  um, am i sweaty.  braces broccolifree.  how's my breath.   what are you so nervous for.  you talk to nicole all the time.  yeah, well, words come easy when you're not asking someone out on your first date.  okay, here i go.  break a leg.  you know, um, i need a real challenge.  like kicking it into the book that girl's holding.  ooh.   chuckie, when i said, "break a leg," i didn't mean, you know, break a leg.  minor setback.  not a problem.  um, nicole...  tommy pickles.  you are the cutest boy in school.  okay, that's a problem.  dang.  tommy, walk me to my locker.  well, uh, i, uh, can't.  got to see a guy about a thing.  okay, see you later.  what's going on with her.  i was going to ask you the same thing.  she sure acts like she likes you.  i've got to hit her again...  you know, um, to be polite.  so i'd like to compare notes on what it's like to besopopular people actually hate you.   dang.  yo, what was...  susie.  are you going to the dance.  want to go with me.  want to go steady.  i'm not being too pushy, am i.  no, no, no, and yes.  tighta definite maybe.  you want to take susie to the dance.  susie..  yeah, she's great.  and i never knew it till just now, angela.  it'sangelica.  don't move.  you stole sean from me, you... you seanstealer.  did not.  i was minding my own business.  more like you were minding mine.   oh, man.  so there's points off for hitting a sean instead of a nicole.  oh, yeah.  and i thought the rule of thumb was complicated.  so you're sure you're not forgetting about a time you saved her life or bought her a dessert or a car.  no.  well, you had to do something to make her suddenly like you so much.  i didn't, chuckie.  i swear.  besides, i wouldn't do that to you.  she's probably just being polite.  i know she likes you way more than me.  really. you think.  i've been looking for you.  "happy valentine's day."  thanks, and it isn't even valentine's day yet, uh, except in mexico, i guess.  i give the really special ones early.  oh, hi, chuckie.  you get the special one.  man, i am totally sorry.  this is like a really bad afterschool special.  i want to do something to help, but i don't know what.  i think you've done enough.  but...  dil: i'm thinking the school environment may be cramping your style.  you're more of an outsidethebox type.  and in light of your recent mishaps, perhaps you should work your way up to humans with some stationary egobuilding targets.  i'll, uh, go order the smoothies.  if you know what's good for you, you'll keep susiethe boyswiperaway from "z." oh, yeah, because i'm bored with sean, who i stole just yesterday.   a) susie's like my best friend, and b) z is just a good bud.  thanks for the alphabet lesson, but i still say you can't trust her.  right.  watch and learn.  susie, want to help z carry the smoothies back to the table.  if you think you can trust me.   i thought you might need help.  susie, susie, susie.  huh.  oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.   susie, there you are.  i've got it covered, so buzz off.  oh, yeah.  i'm taking her to the dance.  i'm taking her.  z, we're going as a groupyou, me and kimi, remember.  kimi. kimi who.  kimiwho.  i'm taking susie to the dance.  i'm taking her.  you're not supposed to be taking anyone.  you're not supposed to care.  i don't.  ii mean, i didn't.  okay, i do.  name your corsage.  my uncle runs a limo company.  i can get us box seats at the opera...  ...if, you know, that's where we're going.  hmm.  i don't know what's going on.  best friends. ha.  kimi, wait.  sean: susie, wait.  z: hold on.   sean: susie.  dang.  okay, there's no point in working your slow twitch muscles, since most targets will probably be moving.  so we'll focus on your fast twitch ones, enhancing muscle memory.  i'm going to run. you throw.  thanks, dil, but my mojo's a no go.  they give me one week a year to show my stuff and i blew it.  maybe i better hand in the hacky sacks.   pickles residence.  oh...  uh, hi.  pork chops.  homework.  tv.  bye.  was someone taking a survey.  kind of.  it was a girl.  but she's madly in love with me or something.  sshe may go ballistic.  mmm... the pickles curse.  i mean, chuckie's the one who likes her.  uhhuh.  he wants to take her to the dance.  both: ah.  only he never got a chance to ask her.  maybe once she finds out hewants to take her to the dance, she won't be interested in me.  hey, thanks for your help.  i don't know what we said, but i'm glad we said it.  what's with spike's sudden interest in the vacuum's venetian blind attachment.  chuckie: uh, kimi.  i just wanted to tell you the same thing that's going on with you, susie and z is going on with me, tommy and nicole.  so i know what you're feeling.  oh, really.  you suddenly realized you have a crush on z, too, and your best friend's a backstabber.  not exactly.  the difference is, i've given this a lot of thought and i'll be darned if i'm going to let this ruin my friendship with tommy.  if he swears he did nothing to make nicole fall madly in love with him and reduce me to a grain of sand on the beach of life, then...  i believe him.  he even told me to ask her to the dance.  oh, yeah.  i heard him say he was hoping nicole would turn you down.  what. no way.  tommy'd never do anything like that.  that's what i thought about susie.  nicole.  uhhuh.  well... what would you say if some guy, uh, who's really nice but kind of shy, wanted to take you to the dance.  i'd love to go to the dance with you, tommy.  what..  oh, it's so cute when a boy makes up a fake boy just to test the waters.  no, no.  oh, i can't wait to tell everyone.  tommy's taking me to the dance.  tommy's taking me to the dance.  chuckie, believe me, she got it all wrong.  i don't want to take her to the dance.  tommy.  how could you lie to me.  i'm not.  it's all a mistake.  surethe only mistake i can see is the one i've been making for the last nine years: you know, thinking you were my best friend.  but it's not what it looked like.  dang.  like i said, we... can't... go...  to the dance... together... nicole.   but you'll be there and i'll be there, so we will be going together.  you're so cute when you're confused.   you heard me tell her no, right.  yep.  how comeshe didn't hear it.   sean is the perfect guy for me and you know it.  we are totally alike.  he does stare at himself in the mirror as much as you do.  so you'll tell him you're not interested.  i'm not interested in him or z.  and i told them so.  i wish they'd both just leave me alone.  boy, you tell them no and they come back for more.  hey, maybe sean's the kind of guy who likes rejectionmy specialty.  thanks, miss nolongeranitemwithsean.  phew.  i finally lost them at the bookstore.  hey, susie.  is it me, chuckie, or does valentine's day make people a little nuts.  it's like kimi and i were never best friends.   how can you say that.  well, if we were, she'd have believed me when i told her i didn't have anything to do with z liking me.  well, yeah, but sometimes the evidence is just so...  i mean, isn't that the point of being best friends.  you trust each other even when everything is telling you not to.  that's not crazy, is it.  no.  not crazy.  not crazy at all.  chuckie, you want to go to the dance with me.  uh... okay.  just as guys, right.  susie really said that.  and i cut her out of a picture of us last night.  well, we can start taking new pictures.  right now.  i arranged these in an ancient aztec symbol denoting friendship.  take one, and it'll say something totally different.  like "cover your mouth before coughing." how valentine's day is that.  dil: you're going to get it right this time.  i feel it.  and when dil pickles feels something, it's not gas or indigestion.  you don't need training.  you need untraining.  just let it go, lil "q," and be one with your muse.  let it go.  hello, chuckie.  nomy turn to talk.  while my confidence tablecloth has been yanked out from under me because nicole doesn't like me the way she likes you...  you're still my best friend.  and if you tell me you don't know what's going on, i believe you.  angelica: i'm so afraid sean butler is going to ask me to dance, and i can't stand him.   what.  no, i don't need more longdistance minutes.  huh.  hey, you're here with harold and his killer hits.  time to kick things off, so grab a partner.   don't think so.  go work that finster magic, chuckie, and ask her to dance.  we got ourselves an incoming.  let it go.  chuckie.  yeah, i knowlast guy you want to see, but would you like...  to dance.  love to.  boy, i'll never get this game.  you don't have to.  but that "let it go" thing really worked.  i'm back.  hey, bootgirl.  want to dance.  but i thought you...  uh.  man, what was that.  hey, angelica, did you see what...  i'd love to.  whoa, but i don't want to...  dance.  okay.  i just want to make one more shot.  that wasn't supposed to happen yet.  hey, would you ask my sister to dance so i can eat.  whoalil "q".  if this isn't proof, i...  huh.  oh.  ohhhh.  if only you were cupid's arrow.  captioning sponsored by thepzxbxbpzpppzxbpppzspp(]p08pzp08(]0ep08pz fpxp08xf08pxvxf08pxf080zp(](](] got to blast.   into the
