   tommy: don't worry about them, guys.  as long we go in a big group, we'll be perfectly safe.  this is going to be the best halloween ever.  lil: hey, check this out.  chuckie: "t.p. and k.f.".   tommy pickles and kimi finster.  did you write that, tommy.  of course i didn't.  why would i be interested in kimi.  hello. i'm in the room.  please, kimi, tell your brother there's no way i'd be interested in you.  there's no way he'd be interested in me.  well, someone had to write it.  it could've been anyone.  angelica could have done it to burn us.  hmm.   you're right.  what was i thinking.  phil : and this is kimi finster's second attempt.  her form is perfect, her concentration is high.  nothing can distract her...  phil.  what's wrong with me.  i can't hit a single pin.  that's because you're looking at your feet.  if you want to hit the pins, look at the pins, like this.  hmm...  chuckie, you're up.   uh, would you guys like your own lane.  i was just helping her out, chuckie.  no, helping her out would be "can i get you a soda." way over there.  chuckie, i told you, i'm not interested in your sister.  but if you were, you'd tell me, right.  of course.  because you know it's against the rules to mack on your best friend's sister.  i know, and i'm not.  good, that's settled then.  good.  but how come you're sweating.  i'm not sweating.  drip, drip, drip.  i'm not sweating.  now, would you let me bowl.     that has nothing to do with me liking kimi.  tommy likes kimi.  what. huh.    kimi: chuckie, there is nothing going on with me and tommy.  not that it's any of your business if there was.  aha. there is something.  would you stop that.  look, maybe tommy did carve those initials, but maybe it was a long time ago.  then why wouldn't he just admit it.  i don't know.  maybe he's just embarrassed.  maybe.   what are you doing.  clearing lines of sight.  i need to be able to see for at least a mile in every direction.  chas, you can't cut down a tree just because we get toiletpapered every year on halloween.  oh, no.  well, look at the scars on my hand.  that's what six years of picking twoply off the rose bushes will do to you.  so this year i'm turning this place into a fortress.  fortress finster.  i don't want my house turned into a fortress.  how about a citadel.  no.  a bulwark. no.  a keep.   oh, good, the backhoe's here.  that one needs to come out by the roots.    nice.   chas: hello.  oh, hey, tommy.  yeah, just a second.  kimi.  telephone.   i'm worried about him, kimi.  i know.  i've never seen him wig out like this.  if only there was some way i could convince him that...  i'm completely unattractive to you.  exactly.  thanks. i'll think of something.   who's there.  aha.  "aha".  what "aha".  you were with kimi just now.  we were talking about how paranoid you're being.  and why were you spying on us.  don't try to make this about me.  you lied.  but i already have a girlfriend.  rachel.  so now you're a twotimer and a backstabber.  listen to yourself.  i just want you to be honest with me.  i've told you everything.  i told you i wet my bed until i was seven.  you never told me that.  oh. so why are we still talking about it.  fine, chuckie, i did carve those initials.  all these years i've been planning, waiting.  i was never interested in you, just your sister.  aha.  again with the "aha".  i was being sarcastic.  look, if you feel this way, maybe we shouldn't be stuck in the same costume trickortreating.  i'll go you one bettermaybe we shouldn't be friends at all.  you'd just take all our history together, all those great years and flush them down the toilet.   what's that.  it's a flushing sound.  oh. you always were bad at impressions.  well, now i have the rest of my life to work on themwithout you.  fine.  fine.   charms, mmm...   did you see that.  whoa wait.  over there.  what.  whoa, ahh where'd he go, what's happening.  wahoo, wow, whoa with these new swirled charms, i can teleport get him.  whoa, where'd he go.  new swirledlucky charms, part of a completebreakfast.  discover the magicallydelicious power...  of telaporting.  lil: how can you not be friends with tommy.  you've always been his best friend.  don't you mean "sidekick".  of course not.  no.  it's truei'm always following tommy around while he gets all the glory.  well, those days are over.  i don't need tommy to get through life anymore.  i feel like this is all my fault.  oh, no, it's not.  you're just a victim in all this, like me.  who are you going to go trickortreating with.  what do you mean.  you guys, right.  uh... lil.  uh...  guys.  the thing is, we can't go with you and not tommy.  it wouldn't be fairto take sides.  sounds like you are taking sides.  uh... lil.  uh...  fine, then i'll have to find a new best friend, and i'll go with him.  or her. or them.  what. i'm optimistic.  i'll just make a list of the qualities i'm looking for in a new best friend.  anumberone is loyalty.  second, he has to be fun to hang out with.  he's got to be a natural leader.  this new friend is starting to sound a lot like tommy.  okay, new list.    hey, expecting a prison break.  nope, i'm securing my home against t.p.ers.  this year i will be t.p.free, even if i have to turn this place into a keep.  a what, now.  you know, a keep.  it's like a citadel, uh, a bulwark.  it's... oh, forget it.  so, what you got going there besides the giant lights.  nothing muchlaser tripwires, motion detectors, surveillance cameras and the recorded sound of german shepherds barking.   well, why stop there, chassie.  why not get an electrified fence.   ow.   chuckie: trevor, hey.  chuckie, i'm kind of trying not to get beaned here.  nice dodge.  trevor, something just opened up in my schedule and i'm available for trickortreating this halloween.  what about tommy.  oh, he's out of the picture.  you're not friends with tommy anymore.  nope.  great, i'll call him.  mario, hi.  i wondered if you have anyone to go trickortreating with.   i'd ask you to join us, finster, but we're going as a carbon atom.  six electrons, six of us.  couldn't you go as a nitrogen atom.  that has seven electrons.   nerd alert.  fridge, you want to go trickortreating with me.  fridge.  i thought you were deaf in the other ear.  i am.  boy: no.  uh, um...  nein.  sorry, chuckie, i've got plans.   dil: still haven't patched things up with the chuckster.  i'm just giving him a couple days.  he'll come around.  he's not going to blow off trickortreating.  tommy, psst.  word in the cafetorium is you're not friends with chuckie anymore.  where'd you hear that from.  it's around.  listen, there's always a place for you with the kickball posse.  kickball.  it's not even a real sport.  besides, they make you pay for the jacket.  they don't tell you that.  step offtommy's with us.  no... tommy's with us.   whoa, bro, i had no idea you were so popular.  neither did i.  any luck getting someone for trickortreating.  not yet.  my first choices all said no.  but there's this kid with ear hair who's got real potential.  why don't you patch things up with tommy.  he probably hasn't made any new friends either.  uh, guys.   half those kids don't even go to school here.   i'm chuckie.  what's you're name.   sorry, didn't catch that.  okay, so, you want to hang out sometime.  i'll take that as a yes.  trick or treat.  uh, it's not halloween.  thought i'd avoid the rush.  well, what are you supposed to be.  a working stiff just trying to make a decent living to support my family.  i didn't get any candy yet.  would you take a check.  betty: chassie, i really think you're going overboard with the hightech gear.  $3.50, please.  if you're going to get t.p.ed, you're going to get t.p.ed.  not with these babies i won'trussianissue nightvision goggles, the same goggles worn by the russian night volleyball team.  you're not supposed to wear those indoors.  why not.    it hurts.  it hurts.    didn't you read the instructions.  they were in russian.  lil: what's with your new friends, tommy.  it's like you're famous or something.  those people don't love me. they just love the idea of me.  ah, i know what you mean.  when i wear this jacket, i get the same thing.  yeah, they're all over you, philespecially people looking for a good deal on a car.  tommy, you have to patch things up with chuckie.  this has gone on too long.  i know.  i'm really starting to miss him, and i've got no one to trickortreat with.  hello, kimi, phil, lil.   this is my new best friend, uh... i'll call him pete.  all: hey, pete.   you already have a new best friend.  yeah, they're pretty easy to come by.  hey, pete, you want a smoothie.  you don't even have to answer. i think i know you well enough.  what'd you say, pete.   you're so funny, pete.  you guys trickortreating together.  yes, tommy, pete, my new best friend, and i are going trickortreating together.   what..  i never said that.  don't put words in my mouth.  and name is miltie.  heyso, now that you two don't have anyone to go trickortreating with, you should go together.  i'd rather go alone.  tommy, aren't you going after him.  if he's going to act thiway over something i didn't do, i'd rather go trickortreating with rachel.  this is getting ridiculous.  tomorrow may be our last chance to trickortreat together and tommy and chuckie aren't talking.  we have to do something.  like what.  i have an idea, but you're going to have to help me.  phil: this plan's genius, kimi.  yeah, i know.  thanks for doing this with me, phil.  i know how much you wanted to be a car salesman.  international spy.  hey, phil, thanks for letting me go out with you guys.  i was going to go with rachel, but she thinks halloween is an unholy alliance of dentists and candy manufacturers.  her words, not mine.  where's your half.  kimi's got it.  chuckie: the hard part was sewing the butt.  that required some precision stitchwork.  see. i had to add an inch of side seam to adjust for stretch.  i can see that.  ha.  phil.  chuckie.  tommy..  okay, you twonow, talk.  i can't believe you did this.  get me out of here.  your lizard hands are useless.  you have no choice but to work things out.   hey, that took me 48 hours to make.  bill me.  i can't be friends with a seamstress.  tailor.  that's it, i'm out of here.  good. find yourself a new sidekick, you... you... sister stealer.  ooh, you idiot.  i carved those initialsnot tommy, me.  what..  you did.  you mean you like me.  like, two years ago for a second.  get over yourself.  so, chuckie...  now that you know tommy didn't carve those initials, don't you feel better.  no, now it's worse.  dil, any chance you want to go trickortreating with me.  uhuh, can't do it, bro.  i'm over the halloween thing.  it's all a big sham.  i went out last night, didn't get so much as a gumdrop, just a big wad of cash.  what am i supposed to do with $46.80.  fine, i don't need you or chuckie to have fun.  in fact, halloween isn't even about funit's about candy.   trick or treat.   what are you supposed to be.  listen, i've got 50 houses to hit and only two hours to do it.  let's get to business.  i say "trick or treat," you give me candy.  this is the worst halloween ever.  i know, it's just not the same without tommy and chuckie.    phew, i thought it was those teen thugs.  come on, we should at least knock on one door before going home.   : trick or treat.  oh... what do we have here.  a vampire, a genie and a car salesman.  international...   you looking to lease or buy.    trick or treat.  oh, you're the finster boy, aren't you.  i'm sorry, i don't have any candy.  but i'd love some company.  you see, i'm very lonely.   chuckie: and in two days, he got a million friends but i can't even get one.  growing up has always been easier for him.  like this one time when i was five, i thinki might have been six, or 6...  ticktock, ticktocki don't have much time left, sonny boy.       teen: get him.      come back here.  tommy: chuckie, help.   mechanical voice: intruder. intruder.   middleaged ninja.  let's get out of here.   chuckie: you were really scared, weren't you.  uh, yeah.   wow, the great tommy pickles.  you should have seen the look on your facehere's a mirror.  i'm glad i can entertain you.  : oh, i'm sorry.  it's just usually i'm the one who's scared, not you.  you're the perfect one.  perfect. who says.  you have everything, tommybetter hair, better teeth, better sinuses...  a girlfriend.  is this why you were so wigged out by this kimi thing.  i thought there might be something between you two.  i guess i was jealous.  well, there isn't.  now can we be friends again.  yeah.  i don't know what life would be like without you.  kimi: everything cool.  yeah. yeah, we're cool.  what do you say we hit a couple of houses, huh.  chas : betty.  heh... uh... trick or treat.
