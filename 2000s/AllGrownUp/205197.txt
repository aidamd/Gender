 first off, i'm not a morning person, so i don't get up before 8:00 on a school day.  secondly, i don't clean toilets, ever.  then i guess you don't get breakfast.   hey, i was going to eat that.  now let me lay down a few rules.  you are not a guest.  you are part of the family, and in this family no one is any more important than any other.   the school bus is coming.  hello. do i look like i'm ready for school.  you're going to have to drive me.  and this brownbagging is cute in a vintage kind of way, but i buy my lunch.  it's not vintage in this house, and i don't drive anyone to school.  you take the bus.  anything else i need to know about this prison.  yep, last one at the table clears it.  family rule.  but i already made all the stupid beds.       wait.   and then my niece oatmealed her.   so what you're really saying is uncle drew and aunt charlotte are childless.  that is so sad.  their house must echo like their hearts.  don't worry.  it won't be for long.  i give her till the end of the day before she totally caves in defeat.  i think you might be wrong there.  hey, it's not like i want her to win, but trust me, i know my cousin.  she's a lot tougher than she looks.  she stuck her head in the freezer for two hours to catch a cold so she could get out of a test.  i'm with tommy.  i say she lasts.  we all agree angelica always gets what she wants.  but only when she's playing by her rules.  this time she's got to follow the carmichaels'.  definite handicap.  totally.  however, if you care to make a friendly wager...  all right, if angelica survives the week, you have to clip my toenails for a month.  deal, but if angelica bails early, you have to comb my hair for lice.  all: eww.  you are so going to lose.  : last one... had to... clear table...  missed bus... ran here.   your comb or mine.   drew, do you hear that.  is it silence.  our little princescan turn outite a ceaseless racket.  and do you realize we can actually hug without hearing all those annoying gagging sounds.  what do you say we give it a try, wifey.   huh. huh.   heard about angelica temporarily moving out, so i'm here to fill that hideous ringing void in your lives.  what'll it bebackgammon or chinese checkers.   i did it.  i'm here first.  no chores for me.  yeah. whoohoo. yeah.  first.  do you hear..  i got here first.  congratulations.  that means you get to start dinner.  what..  family rule.  it's why the kids always go to the library after school.  it's going to be mashed potatoes for nine, so be sure to peel enough.   quit touching me.  i'm not touching you.  yes, you are.  no, i'm not.    susie: where are you going.  angelica: in front of the tube.  we do not eat in front of the tv in this family.  we sit together and shour day.  good, you guys talk.  i'll be in there.  oh, no, you won't.  oh, yes, i will.  just keep pushing.  look, i've done nothing but cook, clear and make beds.  i'm going to watch tv whether you like it or not.  others: ooh...  someone's going to get it.  oh, please.  what am i going to have to take care of this time.  the dishes.  no, the diapers.   .  we've got another one for you.  have fun.   oh, big deal.  how bad can it be.     angelica, what are you doing.  you said take care of the diapers.  meaning put them all in the bag, tie it up, and leave it on the porch.  we have a diaper service.    this is too good.   but couldn't you just stick it out a few more days.  no.  i cannot stick it out a few more days.  whoa. girl on the edge.  and do i smell... dirty diapers.   forget it...  because... i'm getting out.  angelica pickles admits defeat, and no amount of familial loyalty is going to stop me.  well, i guess it's about that time.  time. what time.  to quit.  i checked with susie.  she said there was no way you were going to make it.  susie said that.  mmm... that's why i bet against you.  so... thanks awfully for quitting.  no way i was going to make it, huh.  floor.  what's going on.  word to the wise, susie: never count angelica pickles out.  ever.  dwayne: quit touching me.  i'm not touching you.  yes, you are, peaches.  no, i'm not, dwayner.  dad.  : dad.    : oh, my gosh.  what's that.  where. what.  get it off me.  hey, peaches, no fair.  angelica: you snooze, you lose.  family rule.   she's getting good.  no, she isn't.  yes, she is.  look at this creaseand it's terrycloth.  i sensed your ennui with my previous game choices, so i brought along one of my own.  dil, i'm impressed.  you invented this.  yeah.  looks like the nut doesn't fall far from the tree.  i call it "annoyance." i'm hoping that after some tweaking, i can market it.  what's the object of the game.  to keep cool.  if you lose your temper, you're out.  i'm talking real 21stcentury stuff.  nothing fazes me.   all right, where do we start.  right on top.    see how that vein is starting to bulge on uncle drew's forehead.  could be just us two.  sweet.   but you said she was caving.  now i'll have to take chuckie's shift at the java lava, and it's sea kelpgarlic smoothie month.  you've got to do something.  if i lose, i have to clean tommy's room for six months, even under the bed, and no one's ever cleaned under there.  o ye of little faith.  do you think i'm going to let angelica beat me at my own game in my own house.  she thinks she's got chores now.  just wait.   ooh...  busted.  there is no way i'm letting angelica win.  are you with me.  or should i just stencil "loser" on your foreheads.  but if we help you, that would be dishonest, cheating.  and i've got a much better chore for the queen of mean.  okay, okay, my turn.     whwhat... huh.  .   time to get up.  saturday... day off...  checked chore list last night.  oh, you only checked the weekly one.  the monthly one is on my desk.  "angelica," "angelica," "angelica." of course, if you want to quit...    not bad.  so, i'm done, right.  normally, but because this is the third sunny saturday in a row, the second one out of bed cleans the rain gutters.  with this.  family rule.  wow.  look what the kids did.  they even alphabetized the spices.  do you think we have them so well trained that....  they're freaks of nature.   and then she said i had to clean them with a toothbrush.  buster came up with that one.  did not.  did, too.   enough.  not only was making up a chore list unfair, but it was downright dangerous.  yeah, you tell them.  and i haven't heard an apology yet.  you said it, sister.  sorry, peachesno harm intended.  same here.  really sorry.  okay...  i'm sorry, too.  it was all my idea, so...  you should punish me.  you're all punished.  grounded for a month.  ooh, ouch.  that was harsh, but frankly, you deserve it.  angelica, anytime you want to go home, you feel free.  you've more than survived the carmichael household.  yes.  i'll clean. i'll cook.  out of here.  i'm really going to miss that girl.  she could get the mildew out of grout like nobody's business.  now, i'm fairly certain it's the person who rolls the number that's most easily divisible by three who gets to go next.  aunt charlotte.  i'm really starting to miss our little one.  steady my hand for me, will you, drew.  you're, uh, asking the wrong person.  i'm back and better than ever.   i win.  princess.  oh, have we missed you.  what are you doing here.  just acting as the putty that keeps this family together.  well, beat it.  their real putty is back.  my job here is done.  honey, i never thought you'd make it this long.  they couldn't break me.  oh, they tried, but every chore they threw at me, i mastered.  i even learned a few things.  like what, sweetheart.  like bleach is a great mold killer, and there's actually a bag inside a vacuum cleaner.  and...  and i never knew how easy i had it here.  it seems only fair that for surviving a week at the carmichaels' and learning a valuable lesson, you should be rewarded.  you can order in whatever you want for dinner.  and watch whatever you want on tv.  halt.  new pickles family rule: we all make dinner and sit down and eat together.  together.  together, and discuss our day.  well, what's the holdup.  well, nothing.  coming, princess.  first off, all cell phones and pagers off.  dad, you make the salad.  hey, i could make my famous caesar.  mom, i'll need help kneading the meatloaf.  meat... loaf.  so, how was your day, mom.  well, i got a new investor for charlotte, inc.  really.  that's great, mom.  and you, dad.  oh, nothing, really.  oh, oh, oh.  well, i parred three holes in golf today.  good for you, honey.  now, angelica, tell me more about this loaf of meat.  captioning sponsored by the u.s. department of educationy aj 2xphy a(] xh(]8b0 hpp8bhpp8bhxpp8bhxpp8bh pp8bh x980x8bppx9 x8bppx9 x8bppx9 x8bppx9 x8bppx9 x8bppx9 x8bppx9 x8bppx9 x8bppx9 x8bppx9 x8bppx9 x8bpp @(](] . every birthday, my mom and dad would say .  .
