do i know you're cindy and libby.   okay, okay, stop.   i believe you, you're libby.  but how do i know you're cindy.  just open the stupid door.  yup, that's you.  sorry, ladies, i'm going to have to search you.    : she's clean.  thank you for coming, you two.  for once i'm really glad to see you.  i'll give you ten seconds to tell us what this is about.  maybe i should let our guest explain.  greetings, honorable children.  i am princess guan qi sui, last heir to the sui dynastybut my friends call me "peggy." : pretty, pretty, pretty peggy sui...  : do you think she's married.  get your tongue off the floor.  it was princess sui who contacted me.  goddard, activate holoprogram 7a.   7ai said 7a.  sui: this is the eggdrop jade, a priceless gem that has been in my family for generations.  the jade has an unstable atomic structure which can channel near infinite amounts of raw energy.  knowing this, my evil brother, a boy named sui, has built a deadly doomsday device.  when powered by the egg, this device could enslave the entire free world.  and that's where we come in.  the egg's currently on display at the retroville museum.  the security system is stateoftheart, but that won't stop us.  you want us to help you rob the retroville museum.  have you popped a synapse.  the egg has got to be secured before peggy's evil brother steals it.  and to do that, i'll need your help.  pinch me, libby, i'm in shock.  you needourhelp.  i can't do it by myself.  jimmy: you've all been chosen for this operation because you each posses a unique skill.  really. what's my skill, jimmy.  it's personal hygiene, isn't it.  well, um... actually, carl, i was hoping you could stay and keep the princess company while we're gone.  but i want to help save the free world, too.  please let me help, jimmy.  please, please, please, please, please, please...  if it's for the good of the free world, then i guess we'll helpjust shut him up.  okay, carl...  carl, okay.   you can help by, um... uh...  by providing nourishing snacks for quick energy.  yay.  who likes fruit chewies.  so, bearing in mind that carl will provide snacks, here's the plan.  hey, lou.  i caught this kid sneaking around the service entrance.  very suspicious.  what are you doing here, kid.  : hello, my name is petesteve. steve.  and i am a diversioni mean, i am collecting money for the united magicians retirement fund.  i love magicians.  hey, kid, you know any magic card tricks.  do i.  allow me to direct your attention away from the wall of security monitors.  the guards should be distracted right about now.  jimmy: this hypersonic blast will be nasty, but it should freeze the alarm system.  ready, libby.       the alarms will stay frozen as long as you sustain that note, libby.  everyone else, go.  stop. nobody move.  jimmy: good call, carl.  how did you know there were pressure sensors.  i didn't, i just thought we could use a snack.  you're up, cindy.  can you reach that control box without setting foot on the pressure sensors.  with the energy boost from this raspberry chewy she can.    we've got ten secondshurry.  the sensors are back online.  stay where you are, cindy.  no problem.  but you'll come back, right.  right.  is this your card.  no...  oh.  well, isthisyour card.  for the tenth timeno.  sheesh, you're not a very good magician, are you.  you also lack showmanship.  i'm going back to the monitors.  uh, uh, wait.  : time for plan b.  who likes balloon animals.  look, an albino snake.   okay, carl.  goddard will lower me down on tension wires and...   oh, no.  goddard must have suffered hypersonic damage from libby's high note.  it's up to you, carl.  i'll have to lower you down while you retrieve the egg.  me.  just replace the real jade egg with this replica, and we're done.  let's do it.     ooh...  look at the pretty lights.  don't touch them, carl.  those are infrared security beams.  infrared.  but, jimmy, i'm allergic to infrared. )
