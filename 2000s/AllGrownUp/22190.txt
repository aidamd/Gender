 oh, i'd better go nowgive you two some time to get to know each other.  mom, i'm...     good morning, sunshine.  what's so good about it.  no sleep, eh.  i can't believe you got so scared at such a lame movie.  if you don't buy the vampire angle, what's your explanation.  i'm open to suggestions.  you drew it on just to mess with us.  would i do something like that.  of course i would.  but i didn't.  hey, i'm as skeptical as the next guy, but these bite marks are the real deal.  two days to the big blowout, huh, phil.  yup.  i can't wait.  hey, do i need to rsvp.  i got it.  everything okay.  you don't seem that amped up about the party.  i am, it's just that...  nothing.  what's the deal, phil.  we're more excited about your party than you are.  i'm excited.  it's just that...  nothing.  hey, where you going.  i've only been bitten once.  oh, you people are paranoid.  the yugottago folks need a decision by tonight.  i want an ice cream cake.  well, i want cupcakes.  of course you wantcupcakes.  what's that supposed to mean.   oh, grow up.  you grow up.  both of you grow up and make a decision by the time i get back, or it's zucchini bread with the carrot frosting.  why didn't you tell me.  tell you what.  that you're a girl.  that i'm living in the same house with a girl.  you're a freak.  you're one to talk.  you're the one who's wearing one of those...  those... girl things that... that girls wear.  a what, philip.  a what..  a bra..   my ears are burning.  betty: that's it, i'm picking the cake.  then pick two, 'cause i want separate birthdays this year.  fine, and i want my own party, too...  and my own cake, with nice, pink, lacy cupcakes.   &b&b&b&b&b  does this girl thing have anything to do with this separate birthday situation.  which, by the way, i'm still protesting.  protest all you want, it's a done deal.  but no yugottago world, no epic party.  how can you do this to us.  i don't even want to be in the same room with lil, much less share a party pavilion.  why.  it's just...  the other day i saw her...  oh, forget it.  if that's the way you want itbut you're risking your reputation.  that's true.  to date, no one else has ever thrown a party that lives up to a deville extravaganza.  remember the allyoucaneat taquito bash.   like it was yesterday.  but who could forget the murder mystery beach party complete with dismembered corpse.  hey, not me.  i still have my bloody foot.  lil and i have had some classic parties, haven't we.  maybe i'll reconsider.   there's something staticclinged to the back of your shirt.  what is it, a sock.    it's one of lil's bras.  get it off me. get it off me. get it off me.   the separateparty mandate stands.  sorry, pablo, but it must be done.  the animals are always the first to go.   kimi: that box, wally.  so, what are we looking for.  sleeping bagsmy slumber party is going to be in the house.  freako's is in the yard.  oh, i can't believe you're going to deny me my first deville party.  give it up, girls.  you're not talking me out of it.  what a shameyou and phil used to be so close you dressed alike.  now you're having separate birthdays.   check me out.  i'm going to catch it.     maybe i'll reconsider about the party.   hey, lil, cool tshirt.  thanks, sammy.  nice... bike.  thanks.  hey, stay away from my sister.  whoa, whoa.  phil, why did you do that..  uh... i don't know.  but i'd do it again.  kimi, i have reconsidered, and separate parties is the only way to go.  don't you think it's kind of weird that dil still takes naps.  oh, it's weirder than that.  he stays up all night and sleeps during the day.  he thinks he's a vampire.  chuckie: he does look kind of chalky.   girl: you're only supposed to leave this clay junk on for 15 minutes.  how long has it been.  two hours.  why isn't this makeover stuff as fun as it used to be.   how about a game of "truth or dare." okay, i'll go first.  dare.  i dare you to merge parties with the guys.  not happening.  aw... why not.  it looks like they're having a blast.  i would, but the thing is, phil's been acting so weird lately.   ever since i got a bra.  it's, like, changed everything.  you got a bra.  does it hurt.  why would it hurt.  i don't know.  shaving your legs hurts.  your mom lets you shave your legs.  my mom said i have to wait until i'm 13.  fourteen.  married.  i'm really not that into growing up.  but if we don't grow up, we'd be freaks.  no, we'd be boys.    ow. ow. ow. ow.  chuckie: can we go in now.  it's too cold out here.  and too buggy.  and too cramped.  bet you anything the girls are having more fun than we are.  why don't we swing into tommy's house, watch his little bro turn into a vampire.  aw, come on, guys.  hey, how about a game of "yugottago".  is it just me, or is that princess nioko hologram kind of hot.   mct, you use deodorant already.  since last month.  i've been using it since last year.  well, i've been using it since birth.   i wish.   well, i have an armpit hair.  no waylet's see.  i pulled it out.  but, i'm keeping it in a jar back home.  ew. ew. ew. ew.  hey, come on, let's go see what the girls are up to.  give it up. go. yeah.  okay, okay, wait.  i'll tell you what.  i don't want toparty with the girls, but i am open toprankingthem.   : . baby, baby, how can i call you .  . when i don't even know your name. .  . maybe you shoulda gave me your number .  . baby, i'm not the one... .  . to blame .  . not the one. .     phil, i'm going to kill you.    : are you hurt.  no.  too bad.   that was wicked awesome.  beats yugottago world hands down.  oh, this is just a warmup.  mct, you still have that wireless internet hookup.  watch and learn, boys.  i'm about to outprank myself.  feel free to take notes.  i can't believe he got pictures of me with my hair like this.  what a jerk.  chilllax, lil, so a couple of guys see us with junk on our faces.  big deal.  computer: mail call. mail call.   oh, no, your brother sent out this file as a mass email to everyone in school.  make that every school in the country.  correctionevery school in the world.  he spammed it to the world wide pen pal site.  this... means... war.  didi: dil.  open the door, please.  dil: can't.  don't worry, you'll thank me later when i don't sink my fangs into your lilywhite neck.  oh, dil pickles, open this door right now.  last name, eh.  guess you mean business.   it's for your own protection.  is this one of my tomato stakes.  looks like somebody watched a movie he was forbidden to see.  somebody who is also late for phil's party.  but if i go outside, i'll risk being thrice bitten.  honey, you know there's no such thing as vampires.  how can such a smart woman be so naive.  go on.  a social gathering's the perfect thing to take your mind off monsters.  fine. send me out there.  i just hope you're satisfied when you have a son who's one of theundead.  as long as you make your coffin every morning, i'm fine with it.  we can egg their tent.  lame compared to what they did to us.   who is it.  it's dil.  you got to let me in.  we can't trust you.  you're one ofthem.  i'm not a vampire yet.  noa boy.  it's an emergency.   swear on the life of your goldfish pablo that the boys didn't put you up to this.  i swear.  i'm sorry i crashed your party, but...  i got no place else to go.  why aren't you in the tent with the guys.  can't be outdoors.  one more bite and it's open season on anything with a neck.  in case things get ugly.   see it and weep, ladies: fresh bite marks.  no doubt about it...  you've been bitten.  byfleas.  those are flea bites, all right.  been hanging around with any dogs lately.  spike.  best pillow a guy could ask for.  oh, well, that's a relief.  except... i was looking forward to the whole beingabletoturnintoabatandfly thing.  so you're not a real vampire, but e you intested in playing one for a night.  color me intrigu.  girls.  i believe we have found our prank.  to the attic.   and then, the old woman came lurking around the corner.  and as she opened her eyes...  all the kids could see were empty eye sockets.  the teenagers screamed in terror and ran for their lives.  until they came upon a field of... ponies.  sweet, friendly, nice ponies who were waiting to carry them all back to safety.   dil: knockknock.   guys, it's me, dil.  can i come in.  should we let him in.  no way.  you guys are being ridiculous.   what's the problem.  they don't want to let you inin case you're avampire.  funny thing about those vampire marks.  turns out they were flea bites.  man, if you could see the egg on my face.  told you so.           that's for the bat.  you okay, chuckie.  sorry, man, i meant to get lil.  nice going, philip.  you started it, lillian.   i did not, you did.  i think i'm going to call my mom and tell her to pick me up.  what do you say, bat boy, want to head home.  yeah, this party's like my career as a vampirea total bust.  this is all your fault, you know.  my fault.  you're the one who wanted separate parties.   : happy birthday.  you, too.  i guess i'm like... you know...  sorry.  it's just ever since the bra incident, i felt weird around you.  me, too.  i always thought you and me were the same, but we're not.  you're a girl.  i don't understand girls.  i don't understand boys, either.  but you know what.  since i am a girl, i could be your girlstoboys translator.  i never thought of it that way, but works for me.  and if there's ever a guy you're into and you need advice...  i don't want to know about it.   who knew growing up was such a pain in the butt.  tell me about it.  you.  guys have it much harder than girlsour voices go whack, we get nose hair and we have to shave.  pleaseguys only shave their faces.  girls have to shave two whole legs.  that's a lot more real estate than a measly face.  well, at least we don't have to worry about that junk for a while.  yeah.  there's really only one thing to worry about right now.  what is that.  how we're going to eat an entire cake by ourselves.    i feel sick.  maybe mom has something we can take.  mom, lil and i ate too much...    i'm blind.  i'm blind.  captioned by media access group at wgbh access.wgbh.orgjphh axph8 (] ha8v @@2hfp.@2hap.@2hap.@2hap.  hapxhha pha xhha phaxh (](](](](] <hxox<xo x<@xox<xo(]<xoxop<xoxowx

"winning script will get made by famous hollywood director." carl:"if you can read this sign, you, too, can write a movie." what a scam.  i can write a movie. yeah. me, too.  you would enter a lame contest like that.  just because you couldn't enter it...  why couldn't i.  oh, please, when they were passing out creativity, you were locked in the little nerds' room.  remember his awful short story.  "call it fate," ursula said, finishing her pastrami sandwich.  "no," lance said, "call it binomial expansion."  and remember his painting.   and remember his opera.  carl: don't even...  that was horrible.  yeah, don't go there.  you rule math and science, but have the creativity of a tree stump.  oh, yeah.. we'll see about that.  cut. exit scene.  fade out.  what's he talking about.  got methat was creepy.  i'll show those guys.  how hard can it be to write a "screenplay."  wait a minute, i have to approach this scientifically.  goddard, download the most successful movies and let me watch them at hyperspeed.    : i'm king of the...  precious...  may the force be...  home...  box of chocolates...  there is no try...  nemo.  to infinity and...  we left kevin.  and your little dog, too.  go to blast.  so, what's your movie about, libs.  my movie's called cappuccino jones.  hip hop singer by day, fashion designer fbi agent by night.  well, my movie's about a handsome, buff llama rancher who's in love with a beautiful older woman named judy.  hey, isn't jimmy's mom named judy.  uh... no, i made that name up.  i couldn't think of anything, so i just stapled some pages of the phone book together.  i call it,attack of the people named frank johnson.  mine's about a beautiful blonde girl who gets perfect grades and is extremely popular.  so it's a work of fantasy.  very hilarious.  and what did mr. no talent write.  ah, just a little something i call the world's greatest movie.  and that's a wrap.  cut. print it.  man, what is wrong with him.  seven. )
