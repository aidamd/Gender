 i knew it.  and i guess "lid" and "ymmot" are dil and tommy.  back to 250 signatures shy of winning.  and i'm signing on board as kimi's advisor.  there is no way i'm going to let you mess up the democratic process with your dirty tricks campaign.  come on, "imik."  now can you hear me.  .  . .  wow.  new koolaid fun fizz.  drop it. watch it. drink it.  .  .  from the dreamworks movie"how to train your dragon," rated pg, comes a trainable dragon of your very own.  there's one in your mcdonald's happy meal.  . ba da ba ba ba .  come on, toothless.   i crush the director.  well, i crush a danimals crush cup.  huh. danimals crush cups.  you crush it and slurp it.  mmm. awesome.  i crush you crushing a danimals crush cup.  now with new explosive fruity flavor.  wrong. wrong. wrong.  i thought the point was not to distinguish myself.  to be who i am.  you mean a loser.  and by the way, from now on you're wearing contacts.  cccontacts..  but i can't touch my own eyeballs.  i took the liberty of picking some up from your eye doctor on the way home.  that'll be $57.5020 bucks for the lenses, and $37.50 for my consulting fee.  i'm not sure i want to be my own man yet.  i mean, i don't know much about the whole cell phone issue, so could we just leave my eyeballs out of this.  it's not about issues.  it's about image, spin, smoke and mirrors.  and, according to my polling information, your glasses make you look "untrustworthy." and the eyebrow dandruff on your lenses is gross.  wait.  you're doing polls.  like i have the time.  duh, i hired someone.  now hold still.    on a scale of one to fiveone being least likely, five being most likelyhow often would you say you'd use a cell phone in the middle of gym class.  never. i don't have a cell phone.  okay, okay, let's say for the sake of my poll, you do.  dil, i don't have time for this.  i've barely slept trying to get this movie done for the finsters' anniversary party.  it's only a few days away and i'm still scanning.  and i promised chuckie.  on a scale of one to fiveone being absolutely not, and five being absolutelydo you resent chuckie for asking you to do this.  : dil.  what did you say.  i said, "can you hear me."  early bird catches the worm.  correction: "cookies catches the worm." "hang up on cells." cute.  mmm...  and tasty.   we'll get enough names by the end of first period.  ouch.  locker.  ooh.  water fountain.   boy: cookies, cool.  boy: chocolate chip.  yeah, wow...   food poisoning.  there's nothing wrong with these cookies, i baked them myself.  it's trichinosis, i tell you.  you get that from undercooked pork.  oh.  salmonella.  eggs.  botulism.  dirt.  the opposition's trying to poison me.    you can knock off the performance. you scared everyone off.  boy, do i feel better.  don't anyone move.  my left contact's around here somewhere.    but how are we going to fight angelica and her sleazy tactics and still win.  i don't knowmaybe this petition thing wasn't a good idea.  you can't give up now and just let angelica roll over you.  angelica.  i thought we were fighting for the cell phone lists.  sure, sure, and them, too.  so what are you doing.  nothing. right. nothing.  and according to my numbers, scientifically calculated to within fiveeighths of a point, the petition race is a dead heat.  even after my performance this morning.  are you sure your numbers are accurate.  pickup sticks don't lie.  kimi's argument trumps your scare tactics.  she's the face of positive.  in fact, in all my hours of polling, i've never seen numbers like hers.  i mean, she puts her name on mud, and the next thing you know, they'll be serving it up at the cafeteria.  i got to take kimi down a notch or two, but how.  well, i'd buy mud in the cafeteria, but i don't sling it, sister.  triple espresso smoothie to go.  coming up.  so how are you progressing with the film footage and photos i gave you.  not that i'm being pushy, but the party is in two days.  great, fine, not a problem.  it'll be done on timeyes, it will.   perfect.  but we can't do this.  will you keep it down.  clearly, you don't understand modern politics.  but breaking and entering.  but what if we get caught.  i don't think i can live down that kind of humiliation.  you live it down all the time.  good point.  oh, i wish i'd never mentioned the embarrassing kimi photos.  live and learn.   besides, nothing destroys an issue more than embarrassing photos.   hello.  "quick. somebody hand me a cell phone".   it's a frameup.  it's all angelica's dirty tricks campaign.  it's pottygate, i tell you.   that's it, that's the last one.  oh, man, i'm loaded with paper cuts.  psst.  what's going on.  i'm not supposed to leak information to the opposition, but angelica's been stingy at paying me, so here goes.  what do you want first, the bad news or the evenworse news. bad.  recent poll numbers suggest this latest tactic of angelica's has worked.  the anticell numbers are down.  way down, fallingoffthecharts down.  like they're wearing iron pants down.  we get the point.  don't you want to hear the worse news.  i already know the worse news.  my brother gave angelica this idea.  who else would have known about the photo.  there's nothing left to do but fight fire with fire.  what do you mean.  tomorrow, you two will be presenting your cases at the school assembly.  you'll just have to get down and dirty.  but what about our ideals.  the democratic process.  you want your issue to win, don't you.  it's time to take angelica...  i mean, cell phones down.  chuckie: and in conclusion, let me just say...  angelica : hold up cell phone.  hold up cell phone.  no, you hold up the cell phone.  oh, right.  the only way you'll take this from me is out of my old...  i mean, cold, dead hands.   yeah.  when you aren't using those cold, dead hands to hang your dirty tightywhiteys on the bathroom doorknob.   once. i did it once.  i thought this was about cell phones, not dirty tightywhiteys hanging off of doorknobs.  which, by the way, i am for.  ew.  huh. yeah, it's done.  the film's done, practically done.  bro, never mind. go back to sleep.  kimi: well, you still sleep with a baby blanket.   and you still suck your thumb.   better than chewing on my own toenails.   well, i'll tell you something about kimi finster's commitment to the anticell phone lobby you should know.  she asked santa claus for a cell phone...  three years in a row.  i've got her lists.   yeah, she's a goner now.  i'll say.  okay, okay. i admit it.  but i wanted the cell phone before i didn't want it.   that's it. i'm calling it.  this debate is over.  hey, it's not over till i say it's over.  eh, okay, it's over.  and i'm not going to our parents' wedding anniversary if you're going to be there.  same goes for me.  i hate you.  double it and add caramel sauce.  i wish i'd never started this whole stupid petition thing.  audience member: now can you hear me. now can you hear me.  i've done worse than undermine democracy.  i've helped bust up a family.  ah, you've done worse, kid.  and that was one hammy reading you just gave.  this is all yourfault.  you started this whole mess by playing dirty.  i always play dirty.  plus, kimi and chuckie were more than happy to go along, so it's not like it's all our fault.  but like it or not, we're the ones still speaking to each other.  we have to talk them both into going to their parents' anniversary party.  i don't get involved in family business.  ha. since when.  and even you know their own children have to be there.  especially if i could get blamed for them not showing.  yeah, your parents can punish you by taking away your cell phone.   now who's playing dirty.  and as your adviser, i order you to go.  forget itnot after all the things kimi said.  what. what did she say.  not anything anyone didn't already know.  that's not true.  word on the grapevine is you and kimi aren't going to the anniversary party.  the grapevine would be correct.  well, if you think you're not gonna show, think again, my friend.  i haven't stayed up night and day for a week just so this movie could play to an empty room.   okay.  but i'm only doing this for you and my parents.  will you let go now.  my skin hurts.  and i'm not sitting anywhere near that finisher girl.  and i'm really sorry for the part i played in all of this mess, but you have got to go to your parents' anniversary party.  your mom and dad's be so hurt if you don't.   fine.  but i'm not sitting anywhere near that chuckie guy.  hew.  betty :..  here's to the kids on their tenth.  and now rumor has it we're in for some entertainment.  chuckie and kimi have prepared something extra special.  wow.  did someone just hear crickets.  eh, kids.  "f" is for the family that you ruined.  well, "i" is for the icy way you treated me.  it's what we get for sending them to public school.  kimi: "n" is for the nincompoop you are.  "s" is for the sister that you're not.  bro. we're sinking.  roll tape.  am, too. are not.  huh. what.  tape. roll tape. roll tape.  kimi: am, too.  chuckie: are not.     forget the polls, dude.  follow your heart.   betty : i tell you, i don't know what's going on, but it's working.   we couldn't be more proud.  yeah.  oh, angelica, isn't this beautiful.   they call this a gift bag..  susie: wow, i can actually hear the birds.  it is so nice since your cell phone ban went through.  didn't.  compromised instead.  susie: a cell phonefree zone.  you know, that's a great idea.  why didn't we think of that in the first place.  i'm amazed you're in the zone, girl.  can't use your phone.  all right, i'll admit it.  i'm not totally unhappy not being on my cell phone every minute.  i'm actually talking to people.  you know, directly.  facetoface.  did i say you could look at me..  feels great.  well, that was my goal, to show people they don't need cell phones to actually communicate.   what's that. what's what.  that.   i don't hear anything.  it's coming from...  your pocket.  told you not to call me at school.  i just wanted to know if we were walking home together.  well, can i help it my dad gave us these as a thankyou gift for their anniversary party.  i'll put it away.  just as soon as i text message someone.   captioned bymedia access group at wgbh
