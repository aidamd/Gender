trouble.  i'm a good boy.    you know, for someone who's always mapping out their future, you have one lousy sense of direction.  fine, i'll ask someone, okay.  now, get off my back, woman.  excuse me, is there a bridal store...   excuse me, do you know...  everything is in korean.  really.  maybe that's why they call it korea town.  boy, i must be really hungry, because that duck hanging by its neck in that window is looking good.  oh, found a dollar.  yes.  there's a pay phone.  we can get the number for the bridal shop, tell them to hold my backpack, have them call the school.  the susie express is back on track.  mmm...  ever try kimchi.  it's not bad, and i got this whole thing for a dollar.  what.  what.  you just ate my future.  future, future, futurecan't you talk about anything else..  it wouldn't hurt if you thought about yours once in a while.  i think about my future.  do you know how long i spend every night laying out my clothes for the next morning.  this is getting us nowhere.  i believe it's time to use the three cscommunication, cooperation and compromise.  bossy. bigmouth.  i wish we never got married.  we didn't.  fish merchants hawking in background) back off, sister.  i've got one hour to find my laptop and get to school and i am not going to let anything get in my way.  whoa.  : i can't take it.  i can't take it.   i can't take it anymore.    you might as well just bet me for that paper route right now, because my future is dead.  how's this sound: "would you like fries with that."  come on, susie, we'll get back.  i have a plaid mini i have to accessorize for tomorrow.  how do you do that.  do what.  skate through life focused on the most superficial things without any concern for the future.  we're 13.  it's our job.  you know, susie, you can plan every second of your life, but won't that be kind of boring.  all i'm saying is if you're only looking down the road, you'll never see the "half off" signs along the way.   i've got kimchi in my pocket and i'm not afraid to use it.  what are you two girls doing way out here.  do you know that bridal shop near the park.  oh, let's just go home.  sure, i know it.  i got my dress there.  want to see our wedding picture.  here you go.    there he is, phil.  there he is.  no names.  i told you it's rico.  what..  you can't.  sorry.  hey, just you hold on.  this is my sister.  she's his biggest fan.  she knows all his moves, she has all his posters...  shh, they'll figure out we ditched.  i don't care.  i am not leaving until she gets his autograph.  then neither are we.   oh, fine, this way.  thanks... rico.   the police have staked out the school.  they're sure the girls will turn up.  i keep seeing their little facesso alone and scared.  i feel so helpless.  you really care about these children, don't you.  i never realized what a sensitive, caring, bald man you are.  what can i say.  i have so much love to give.   help me.  help me.    i don't know anymore.  what do i have to do to reach you.  just once i'd like to hear, "how was the egg salad, chuckie." um, i'm sorry.  did... did you say something.  i'm deaf in this ear.  you're deaf.  sure, i thought everybody knew that.  look who you're talking to.  i'm not exactly in the loop.  wow, all this time i thought you were ignoring me.  chuckie, right.  yeah.  so, uh, how was your egg salad.    susie: we're fine.  mr. pangborn, they're here.  oh, joy.  i'd better get a lawyer for this.   you know, you don't have to agree with me on everything.  i feel the exact same way.  see. like that.  i'm moving out.  wow, i thought they'd be together forever.  you know, this marriage thing is a lot harder than it looks.  oh.  you know, angelica, i am glad we ended up together.  you taught me you have to enjoy the journey, not just the destination.  like if i hadn't gone into that tattoo parlor, we wouldn't be making it back in time for your interview right now.  uh, but we wouldn't have gone into that tat shop if you hadn't made us late in the first place.  we wouldn't have been late if you hadn't lost your old backpack.  i wouldn't have lost my backpack if your big head hadn't gotten stuck in that dress.  bigmouth. bossy.  i wish we never got married.  susie: we didn't.  did anybody call the police and tell them the girls were safe.  whoops. oh, well, we'll call when we get to school, mr. pangborn.  call me estes.  estes.  i am never going to wash this shirt again, or these socks, or these shorts.  maybe i just won't bathe.  i don't know why i got all aggro, man.  i knew we'd get away with it.  we are a lean, mean hooky machine.  all: yes.    okay, we ditched.  we admit it.  i'm sorry.  i'll never do it again.  i swear.  don't take me away.  he's a bad influence.  captioned by media accessph
