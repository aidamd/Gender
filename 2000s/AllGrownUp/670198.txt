 and scare me half to death.  it's just... you're so busy, i didn't think you'd notice.  everything around here is always soccer, soccer, soccer.  dad, can you put on the soccer channel.  lil, every season i invite you to join the team.  that's your thing with phil.  oh... forget it.  how about we squeeze in some lil time tomorrow, huh.  after practice we can have a girls' night out.  we're not shopping for bras, are we.  that's your father's department.   psych. that's what you get for worrying me.  kimi: what's with the getup.  i'm going shopping... for a boyfriendpreferably 13 years of age or older, with a pulse.  : how romantic.  hey. hey.  shoot.  hey, boys, what you doing.  i said what are you doing..  we're trying to play a game, but you're in our way.  oh.  that worked out well.  put a lid on it, carmichael.  coach: wally, eye on the ball.  eye on the ball.  no. no. no.  you have to keep your eyes straight ahead andfeelit.   you ever heard of the word "assistant".  it means you zip it while i do the coaching.  betty: lil, watch out.   lil, this is wally, our team captain.  yo, what up.  savage save there.  so, you going to join practice or what.  oh, i'm not really a soccertype person.  but, hey, anything's better than conjugating verbs, right.  time to work on penalty shots, people.  : because heaven knows you need it.  lil, get in goal.  in what.  just get in the boxthat thing with the netand catch.       didn't feel it.  go, team.  what the sam heck are you supposed to be.  a flatspired threetooth snail.  mascots are supposed to be...  you know, carnivores.  i think you and i both know those animals get way too much face time.  do me a favor, just try something a little less... repulsive.   whoa, what a move.  did phil finally get a piece of the ball.  nope, not phillil.  wow, lil's amazing.  and that's a good thing, right.  for lilnot so sure about phil.    phil: oh, oh, and when i'm, uh, taking a penalty kick, i always aim straight for the goalie's head.  he'll duck.  and that works.  totally.  it doesn't sound legit, but who cares, right.  and, uh, now that you're part of the deville soccer dynasty...  i'm passing these on to you.  my lucky cleats.  that's weirdthey don't even smell.  that's why they're lucky.  wow. thanks.  betty: is that the overhead light you just smashed to smithereens..  yeah...  you're putting too much spin on ball.  come at it from the side, not the bottom.   angelica: this place is crawling with "accessories."  ooh, good game.   what is wrong with these people.  a gorgeous girl standing right in front of them and i may as well be invisible.   susie, the time has come for me to lower my standards.  a lot.  to the computer store.   hehe, you're pretty.   i can't.  i can't.  and just because we've lost every single game... ever...  doesn't mean that today we can't lose by a little bit less.  wally, you're center forward.  lil, right forward.  phil, you're midfielder.  everyone else, go out there and pretend like you're playing soccer.  phil, do you ever get that kind of sick, abouttothrowup feeling before a game.  you'll be fine, lil.  and if you've got to hurl, do it by their goal.  another winning strategy from phil deville.     chuckie: uh, phil's pretty good...  isn't he.  he never stops running after the ball, and he moves his arms around a lot.  but has he ever scored or made actual contact with the ball.  he does wave his arms around a lot.  yeah. definitely.  good arm waver.  give it up, ang.  you're not going to find a boyfriend with binoculars.   what is it. is he cute.  ooh...  lil, just kick it.  kick it anywhere.     sweet.  way to go. way to go, girl.   ha.    aah.     i love this game.   i do. i do. i do, i do, i do.    boy: all right, lil.  good game. good game. good game.  uh...  game.  angelica: do you see that.  lil's surrounded by boys.  that's it.  sportsit's a guy magnet.  i just need a sport.  you're forgetting one itsybitsy detail: you have no athletic ability whatsoever.  yeah, but that sure doesn't stop phil.   ow, so hot.  ow, ow.  so, lil, have your teammates erected a statue in your honor yet.  yeah, right.  well, they should, girl.  you handed them their first victory ever.  are you guys talking about me.  why would we talk about you.   unless we were talking about what a good game you had.  man, it feels so good to finally find something i love.  i dare youpunch my stomach.  i won't even feel it.  go on, punch my stomachgo on.  i'll do it.   lil's ego is so huge it needs its own zip code.  phil, your team won for the first time ever.  shouldn't you be happy.  iamhappy, but everyone's acting like we only won because of lil.  what's the big d.  she's good, but she's not better than me.  right, chuckie.  ow, ow, ow.    you're supposed to aim it at my racket, you moron.    phil: over here, lil.  i'm wide open.    we won.  why didn't you kick it to me.  you weren't open.  i was so open i had a welcome mat on my head.  you are so lame, lillian.  oh, phil's out of control.  last week he welcomes me to the wonderful world of soccer, gives me his luckyand amazingly odorfreecleats, but since then, he's been completely hostile.  i don't get it.  tell me the truth.  do i have helmet hair.  more like helmet brain.  you're trying out for football.  are you whack.  look, i know it's stupid, but i tanked at everything else, so this is my last shot.  if i fail, i'll have to come clean with savannah and reserve my star on the loser walk of fame.  : i don't care what me mum says.  i'm going to play until the day i die.    chuckie, will you tell thatperson who's hitting the ball around to knock it off.  chuckie, tell the jerk to turn the volume up on the tv if it bothers him so much.   hey, this is my soccer game tape.  cool.  no, waitthat has to be edited.    lil : yeah.    : hey, let's watch it again.    lil, get your junk out of my room.  she's returning them.  she quit the team.    i know you feel bad for philly, but you're too good to quit.  in all my years of coaching, i have never seen anybody with your talent.  you're way off base, mom.  i've had a soccerfree life for ten years.  obviously, i can live without it.   ghostly voice: play... you know you want to.  just one little pass and shoot.  no.  i told you.  i'm never playing again.    i won't play.  i won't.      you expect to be on junior junior varsity with no upperbody strength.   you're the coach.  why don't you show me how it's done..  put your money where your big, fat mouth is.  that's some squawk box you got on you, pickles.  any chance you'd be interested in a student coaching position.  hmm...    how can lil do this to me.  to us.  sometimes you got to let them make their own choices.   you should shave your neck.  get that frog out of my face.  but there are only a few yellow spotted tree frogs in existence.  and there's about to be one less.      as team captain, i order you to get your sister back on the team.  i can't tell her what to do.  we're playing kirkwood heights tomorrow.  if you don't talk her into playing, we're history.  let me bottomline it for you, deville.  stop thinking about yourself, and start thinking about the team.       tell me the truth.  who's a better soccer player, me or lil.  she's better, isn't she.  isn'she.  mom, dad, please don't make me choose.  answer me.  she's really good, isn't she.  yes.  good. she's great.  beyond great, like scary great. shh.  she could go pro.  he asked.   it's so unfair.  soccer's always been my thing.  yeah, but if you were the one with the gift, i seriously doubt lil would want you to stop playing.  yeah, yeah, i guess you're right.  look at the bright side: if she goes pro, she'll only make ten percent of what the guys make.  : not helping.   thought you were bored with soccer.  i'm just putting the ball in storage.   we're playing kirkwood, and we'll never beat them without you.  i don't get it.  you're mad at me when i play and mad at me when i don't.  guess it kind of... bugged me that you were so good and i'm just... okay.  you're more than okay.  you just need to focus, not put so much spin on the ball.  i didn't come in here for advice, lillian.   i know it's tough for you.  i didn't ask for this.  i almost wish... i was lame.  i almost wish you were lame, too.   hallelujah.  well, from the size of that big, old smile, i'm guessing you scored yourself a boyfriend.  i recently discovered there are better things in life than sacking a guy...   you call that a practice.  looked more like a cotillion to me.  now, shower up, you lazy bums.  getting to boss them around.   shake it off, kids.  we're only down by one.  we can still win.  who's going down.  kirkwood.   this one's working for me, pickles.  good choice.  thank you, sir.  you can never go wrong with a northern hairynosed baboon.      oh... 30 seconds to go.   over here, lil.  you can do it, phil.  nail that sucker.     sweetthat is the way to play 'er.  phil, you scored the winning goal.  i only did it because you said i could.  thanks, sis.  anytime, phil.    captioned by media access gxnvqp 9xnv0upxnp
