"killer bee boy," protector of all things pollinated.  killer bee boy, who strikes fear in the hearts of picnickers everywhere.  that's a superhero.  yeah.  well, he beats the hicky out of that armadillo dave guy.  what's hehalf man, half cashew.  care to step outside.  : ooh... i'm ascared.   buzz off. buzz off.  buzz off.  this is embarrassing, guys, more for me than you...  obviously.  fine.  but consider yourself served.   it's a little big.  it's my dad's old costume.  chuckie: okay.  these push pins represent all the oldage homes mr. leopold might live in.  we're not going to call all those pins, are we.  there has to be a hundred of 'em.  thank you.  he's not in "leisure suit village".  ninetynine.  we're going to be living in one of those places by the time you're done.  ah, tommy's right.  why can't there just be a place called "home for retired cartoon artists".  "home for retired cartoon artists and voices." ooh, so close.  lil, call it.  uh, it's a long shot, but suit yourself.  hello, i am looking for a max leopold.  he isn't.  that's okay...  i'll call him later, when he's back in his room.  we found him.   all right.   : eh, knocky, knockknock.  eh, can i... can i help you.  we're here to see max leopold.  i'm his biggest fan.  : medical personnel only at this hour.  who is also a worldrenowned surgeon.  don't surgeons have to have cleannails.  excuse me, sir.  now, i don't want to pull rank here, but when those old and lonely illustrators in there ask why there wasn't a show tonight, you want to be the one to tell them it was your fault.  what show.  we're carolers.  in march.  we're...  easter carolers.  . easter sunday .  . it's... a fun day .  . dyeing eggs .  . making baskets .  . walking in a parade .  . easter, oohwah. .  : that was...  beautiful.   i got you now...  speedy sam.  honk... honk.   hi. we're looking for mr. leopold's room.  he's in room...  excuse me.  no running in the hall, please.  room 12.    hello, mr. leopold.  my name is chuckie finster.  i am a big fan of armadillo dave.  he was my friend.  i learned to read thanks to him.  well, not really.  but i learned to read thought bubbles.  i know things change when you grow up.  but i wasn't ready for the biggest one: losing armadillo dave.  so, i'm here to ask you to reconsider.  man: first, he's not mr. leopold.  i am.  secondly, get out. thirdly...  : my plate's loose.  not until you promise not to endarmadillo dave.   are those your molars.  armadillo dave had his place in the sun, but that sun's set.  but he doesn't need sun. remember when he was trapped in "the dryer of a thousand socks," with only his poor eyesight and his ability to burrow to rely on.  you really need to watch more tv.  see this. arthritis.  from drawing that crustacean for 42 years.  "crustacean"..  he's adasypus hybridus.  mr. leopold, armadillo dave can't be happy how his life ended.  draw one more issue.  end it the right way.  please.  i'm through with that turtle wannabe.  now i'm late for my sponge bath.  hand me that glue, will you, phil.  i still say there's no way that rat's going to fit in that maze.  only one way to find outone of us puts him in.  and by "one of us," i mean anybody but me.  no way i'm touching that staplerwithfur.  well, i'm too weak from blood loss.  okay, we work as a team.  i'll open the door, phil, you grab the rat, toss him into the shoe box and lil will dump him in the maze.  okay. on three.  one, two...  bye. see ya. good luck with that.  hi, guys.  chuckie.  okay, the contest is in less than 24 hours.  the first thing we need is a cool theme.  any ideas.  darkness.  a bottomless abyss that plummets into black nothingness.  okay, you're sad.  i get it.  but enough already.  isn't it time you got over armadillo dave.  over him.  yeah.  i never really got this in the first place.  i mean, if you're going to moan about some superhero, at least pick a good one.  armadillo dave had to be the lamest superhero ever.  he was nearsighted, slow, and a klutz.  yeah, well, so am i.  maybe he did just roll into a ball and let bad guys beat on him.  maybe he wasn't flashy like all those other superheroes.  but he was still super to me.   i crush the director.  well, i crush a danimals crush cup.  huh. danimals crush cups.  you crush it and slurp it.  mmm. awesome.  i crush you crushing a danimals crush cup.  now with new explosive fruity flavor.  tv narrator: there are over 20 species of armadillo.  the largest is the giant armadillo.  wow.  this show's given me a newfound respect for the animal kingdom.  fish stick.  dad.  how did you get over it when mom died.   well... gee.  you know, part of me will always miss her.  but i had you to take care of, and then kira and kimi came along.  you know, sometimes i think the best way to forget your problems isis by helping others with theirs.  narrator : the armadillo may be a nearsighted and defenseless creature...  ...but it's learned to survive anything life throws at it.     i'm going with feetsie pajamas tonight.  care to join me.  gee, sounds tempting.  no, thanks.  i can't believe chuckie'd bail on me like this, all be lost some dumb comic book character.  i don't get it.  maybe you're not supposed to, t.  what's that mean.  we don't know what it's like to lose someone we love.  chuckie does.  his mom.  you're right.  man, why didn't i think of that.  it's the feetsie pajamas, bro.  yup, they do something to a man.  whoa. whoa.  what are you doing out here.  i was just coming over to see you.  i was coming to see you.  i'm sorry, tommy.  no, i'm sorry.  i made a promise to help you and i should have kept it.  but i didn't know what you were going through.  i wasn't being very understanding.  thanks.  aren't we supposed to hug now or something.  wewe can skip that part.  good. good.  good. good.  you still need help with that maze.  only a ton.  come on.  aplus.  awesome job, dude. thanks.   welcome to the third annual "crazy maze race."  let me introduce this year's judges.  television and recording star emica...   ...couldn't be here due to a lipsyncing fiasco at the syracuse state fair.  in her place, we're lucky to get

time.  mmhmm.  alone in their rooms playing video games.  glued to those spanish language dance shows with the coochiecoochie girls wearing inappropriate teeshirts.  mmhmm.  stu, is that a buffalo up your nose.  mmhmm.   didi : family meeting.  i mean, i've heard about families who don't have television.  yeah, but you never think it'll happen to someone you know.  my mom says we don't talk as a family anymore.  our family watches tv, and we talk.  that's what commercials are for.  it's tommy's fault.  and did you learn anything, bro. no.  never say to your mom, "you're too old to carry that tv out of here." what are you going to do.  : ugh.  nothing we can do.  except miss my favorite soap opera, hospital de temptacion.  incredible.  no tv.  i cannot even imagine that.   and this is the week they'll be picking the winner onamerica's most talented icons.  mi corazon.  mi corazon.  i don't get it.  how can anyone concentrate with all this...  quiet.  i know.   not helping.   what is that faucet sound.  it's not a faucet.  it's my postnasal drip.  well, can you knock it off.  how. stop breathing.  you offered.  do you have to write so loud.  just trying to block out the sound of your postnasal waterfall.  you know, before mom took the tv away, i thought iwas the annoying one.    we finished our homework.  now, what do we do.  yeah, we're bored.  you know, when we were your age, we didn't have kids channels and 24 hour programming.  we used our imaginations.  you also had cars without seat belts.  was that a good idea, too..  ixnay on the old thing, bro.   well, deed, that's the last of 'em.   see, isn't this better.  we can finally talk as a family without competing with that annoying boob tube.   i'm expecting somebody.  let me get it, let me get it.  hello.  betty: so, deed, word in the hood is you pulled the plug.   that true.  yes, it is, betty.  not a television in the house.  and the boys couldn't be adjusting better.  it's so much more relaxing around here.  i even took up knitting.  you make a lot of sense there, didi.     she did, did she.    boy: did you see really talented american icon.  can you believe that guy won..  i can sing better than that.  what do you think, tommy.  go jump off a cliff.  hey, t, want to snag a piece of pie.  better yet, why don't we go bake some..  the home ec room is open.  dil, i think you've had enough sugar.  no sugar, bro.  just a lot of sleep.  i was so bored without television last night, i was nightynight by 5:00.  now i've got energy to burn.  good, 'cause you're gonna need it.  why.  to run
