 you're entering the race.  you don't know anything about cars.  huh, and you do.  i don't care what it takes, you are not winning this, angelica.  you're going down.  yeahdown that hill past you.  au revoir.    what.  lil: what is it.  susie: the hospital volunteer league nominated me for derby queen.  now i got to blow all my jack on some dumb gown.  well, they're going to be sorry.  wait till they get an earful of my speech, dissing their popularity contest.   you're right.  it's so demeaning.  you going to wear something off the shoulder or strapless.  okay, let's see how fast this baby goes.  everybody ready. phil.  : ready.  chuckie, step back.  i don't want to take you out.  brace yourself, t.  and... go.  should i press it now.  we're never going to beat angelica.  let's get this paperweight back to the garage, take it apart and start from scratch.  why the big push to beat angelica, bro.  why. this is why.  this is where she talked me into going up the down escalator.  where she pushed me through the pet door.  where she got me to stick my hand in that anthill.  so we're going to work our fingers to the bone because you kept letting angelica sucker you.  that patch of hair grow back yet.  i'm with you.  with us as your pit crew, you can't lose.   : oh.  theoretically.  what we need to do is upgrade the whole thingbetter wheels, sleeker chassis.  hmm, sounds expensive.  we'll do what real race car drivers do: get sponsors.  here you go, boys.  thanks.  wow, $500.  let's see angelica beat that.  angelica: as you will read in your packets, a gold level gift gets you primo advertising on the hood.  silver level, you're on the door.  the bronze level...  well, don't bother.  so, do i have your commitment for the gold.   okaybut i'm sure when i go across the street to your competition, they won't want to be left behind.  we're very excited.  oh, yes. definitely.  25 cents and an old inner tube.  let's go hit the pet store.  maybe they'll give us their dead goldfish.  okay, but i'm sure when i go across mount fuji to your competition, they won't want to be left behind.  all: hai.   you know, harold, we don't get to talk very much anymore.   enough with the slurping.  what are tommy and his band of merry morons up to.  there's nothing you can say that will get me to forsake my friends' trust.  i'll let you put my karate sash under your pillow.  their first car wasn't good enough, so they're raising the money to make it better.  is this wheel titanium.  man: jawohl.  who's that.  mannheimhe's my mother's mechanic from bavaria.  und nichttouching on the automobile.   this thing's still too heavy, so lay off the sauerkraut and start shaving this nose.   20 dollars, 39 cents and a popped inner tube.  we should quit.  harold: hi, guys.  wow. angelica is only getting gobs of money, but you're getting prizes.  uh, just how much money, harold.  uhuhi can't tell you.  trust is the glue of any relationship.  we'll give you the inner tube.  she brought in a mechanic from bavaria.  that's it.  can we quit now.  if i quit, angelica will razz me my whole life.  no. this is what we're going to do.  we'll take our 20 bucks and roll it over into a surefire money maker.  sounds great. what's the idea.  don't knowanybody.  uh...  hmm...  how about a neighborhood carnival.  yeah, a carnival, with cool rides, a giant midway, and a sideshow with all kinds of oddities of nature.  i know a guy who can turn his eyelids inside out.  oh, wait... that's me.  don't you dare.  tommy: phil, you rent the bouncer.  chuckie, get one of those miniature trains they have at the zoo.  and we'll need about ten booths filled with prizes.  this'll be the best carnival ever.     any customers yet.  chuckie: one.   lil: yeah.  whoonet.  that's my good hockey stick.  wasyour good hockey stick, and your kidvid 2000, and dil's happy copter.  : i rule.  i am almost done with my speech for the pageant.  what do you think sounds better: "humiliating meat show" or "sexist blood sport".  well, i'll throw them both in.   i ordered the bouncer, i swearsee.  yeah, i see.  i see the wrong address.  the people down the street with all those cats got our bouncer.    nice doing business with you, boys.   so... how did we do.  we don't have any customers, and we're broke.  dil: don't lose faith.  i've been tinkering a little with the picklesmobile.  i think you'll find it to your liking.   dil: voil.  tommy: so, what is it.  it is a time machineour portal to new technology, cures for diseases and what we got on our sats.  i wish i could go back in time about nine years so i could warn mom and dad not to have you.  ooh. harsh, t.  i think i'll just step in here and find out when you lose your hair.  okay, whatever you guys had planned for this weekend, cancel it.  we have a car to build.   i thought this was supposed to be about us having fun.  well, it's not about fun.  it's about beating angelica.  for you, maybei was just in it for the wreckage.  maybe that's your problem.  you never take anything seriously.  that's iti'm gone.  tommy: dil, are you going to help me.  i'm still hurting about that "not being born" crack in here.  plus my socks are wet.  i'll stay, tommy.   hey, not so rough.  you'll strip the screw.  you do it, then.  i'm going home to bed.  but first i'm going to have some cereal.   charms,

psyched.  dil, watch my car.  tommy: guys.  aren't you supposed to be beating angelica right now.  what's beating angelica if it means losing my friends.  look, i don't blame you for being mad.  i was a jerk.  i'm sorry.  come on.  we got to get you back to that race.   tommy, where you been.  you have three minutes left.  it's okay, dad.  i got my crew with me now.   don't worry, pickles.  i'll let you polish my trophy when i get it.  in your dreams.   have you ever been down this hill before.  only backwards inside a station wagon.       is it over.  wow.  harold.  my mom's a mechanical engineer.    that skunk.  all that work and he's the one who gets to go to paris, france.  you mean paris, texas.  texas.  you mean i risked my life for a trip to america's dust bowl.    oh, pickles.  about this cousin stuffi'm sorry if i've been kind of rough on you all these years, but i think i've made you a better person.  sticking my hand in an anthill made me a better person.  you'll never do that again.  maybe i'll start lightening up a little.  deal.  deal.  hey, see that girl over there.   you didn't hear it from me, but she said she likes you.  really.  oh, no, i'm not falling for that again.  your loss.  she said that.  maybe i should talk to her.  no, no, nothat's just what you want me to do.  whatever, pickles.   angelica: she's looking this way.  tommy: i can't.  angelica: are you sure.   angelica: whatever.  tommy: angelica.  captioned by media accexzg0ihjxzp2gho0ihxzbgho0ihphxpgh phh/phhh/phhx phhhhhhhhhhhhhihh :hh hh:hh . every birthday, my mom and dad would say .  .

"happy late birthday. love, drew."   the old regifting scam, huh.  well, two can play at that game.   "happy fishing, dil. grandpa." you're destroying our pictures.  only the ones where i'm having a bad hair day.  i'm running out of paper, so i thought you and i could clean out the garage this weekend.  but i'm going fishing with grandpa.  grandpa assumed you were busy, so he's taking dil.  no, i'm not busy, not busy at all.  well, you can let them know that when they get back from bmovies in the park.  what is going on here.  i'm the movie guy, not dil.   where have you been.  the movies.  oh, the movies, huh.  do you know what time it is.  why didn't you call.  is that a root beer float stain on your jacket.  i will not be ignored, grandpa.  "world's greatest grandfather".  it goes with this one.  tommy: "world's best grandson".  i demand to know where you got those shirts.  don't get your panties in a bunch.  i got you one, too.  "world's greatest yodeler".  it was either that or the one that said "foxy mama." well, we'd better hit the hay if we're going to get a jump on the fish.  ah, our old fishing trips...  reminds me of the time we ran over our cooler and had to eat flattened fried chicken for a week.  or the day we saw a family of beavers building a dam.  it rained, so we checked into a hotel and watched the wild animal channel.  tommy, do you want to go, too.  no... not really.  fine.  i'm already packed.  my grandsons on a fishing triplife doesn't get much better than that.  i know exactly what you're trying to do: replace me as numberone grandson.  are you sick.  your 15 minutes are over.  the shine's off the nickel and it's "in: tommy pickles. "out: what'shisname, the younger brother." dude, i have no interest in being grandpa's favorite.  i'm happy to be number twoafter you and before angelica.  besides, the crazy lady with the bird's nest in her hair says i'm her favorite every time i give her a quarter.  know this: i may be leaving this house in second, but i will return from this trip having reclaimed my spot as number one.  i'd rather not indulge you in your infantile competition, but if i have to...  bring it on.  don't even think about it. )
