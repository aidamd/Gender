 and i want a sludgie, a hotdog and, oh...  a box of sticky buns.  uh, but we promised our parents we'd be home already.  you also promised them that you wouldn't see a pg13 movie, hmm.  do you like your sticky buns with or without icing.  with.  angelica, this is the last bus.  if they miss it, their parents will be mad at you.  i'll just have to do the right thing, i guess...  pretend i never saw them.  my phone.  i forgot to get it back.  come on.   we couldn't get you foodthe mall is all closed up.  food. is that all you preteens think about.  i think losing a cell phone is a little more important.    we're trapped.  this is just like when neon got stuck in the 12th dimension...  without the wind machine, earplugs and stunt doubles.  nobody panic.  there's a fire alarm.  i'll pull it, somebody'll be here in no time.    whoa...  how'd that happen.  i have no idea.  phew, that was a close one.  i guess we can leave now.  wouldn't be right playing all the free games.  or eating all the free food.  well... let's go.  are you people crazy..   the rock wall is mine.  last one to laser battle's a buckethead.  shoes. nobody touch the shoes.  all we got to do now is get all the money out and we're set for life.  you sure this'll work, cliffy.  how long are you going to put up with dad flicking your ear and calling you a lazy goodfornothing, huh.  besides, who's going to stop us.  we got the whole place to ourselves.  hey, where'd those minihunas come from.  no little squirts are going to get in the way of that money.  let's go.   check me out.  i am queen of the hill.  slow down or you're going to fall.  well...  hold the rope.  i got another nosebleed.   dil: good takeoff.  looks beautiful from up here, houston.  mayday. mayday.   okay... best 28 out of 30.   jailbreak.   jailbreak.  ow. ow.  ow. these things..look good.  harold, what do you think.  i'm a size 45 in europe.  the mama bear...  the papa bear...  and the little baby bear.   kitty.    nobody understands me.  okay, you take that over to the tower and start sucking out the money.  just because you're three years older doesn't make you the boss.  no, but this does.  ow.  now, get that money, and i'll take care of those kiddies.   lil: hey, chuckiephil just made a cotton candy the shape of his butt.  you gotta come see.   no, thanks.  wow.  why so bummed.  ever wonder what your life would've been like if you hadn't been named "lil".  yeahawful.  the only other name my mom knew that rhymed with phil was "bill." i would've loved "bill"no baggage.  but "chuckie".  i act like a chuckie, i wheeze like a chuckie, get picked on like a chuckie.  what's your middle name.  crandall.  oh.  just once i'd like to feel like a... a bill or a hank...  or a neon.  maybe you are a neonin here.  maybe you're right.  maybe there's a cool guy inside waiting to come o  a little help here.  that's weird.    smile.   dil: guys. guys.  all: dil.  sorry, but there's a robber taking susie's money.  what do you mean, susie's money.  i saw himhe had this big machine and was vacuuming out the money.  it was just like the movie when they sucked out neon's thoughts with the extractinator.  wait a minute.  that would explain why all the stores suddenly opened.  we should call someone.  angelica, you have a cell phone.  hada cell phone.  they took it from me in the movies, remember.  you mean we're trapped in here with a real criminal.  wait, he'll help us.  hey. what are you kids doing in here.  we got locked in.  a robber's trying to steal the tower of dollars.  is that so.  oh, why don't we go down to the security office and we'll talk all about it.   he's no security guardhe stole those sneakers from the store.  run.  cliff: get back here.  you're not getting out of this.  coast is clear.  great idea, philsuggesting that stupid movie.  since when do you listen to me.  i'm a moron.  plus, it was angelica who made us come back in here.  i don't care whose fault it is.  we have to get out of here.  those guys could be mutant androids that spit acid out of their eyes.  that's itno more pg13 movies for me.  i'm going back to epic romances.  we're going to bolt.  no way.  that money is for underprivileged kids.  they don't have that money yet.  we could still stop them.  how.  they're bigger than us.  chuckie: neon would do it.  neon makes 20 mil a picture.  chuckie: okay, forget about neon.  this is about me.  i am tired of running away from jerks.  this is my opportunity to prove that chuckie can be tough, too.  chuckie, if you really think you need to do this, i'm with you.   thanks, guys.  the future... is... now.  ooh.  chuckie : a little help here.  everybody clear.  harold grabs the loot, hands it to me.  they come after methat's when you girls take over.   you sure you want to be the one they chase.  when it comes to running from bullies, who's most qualified.  you are.  right. hmm.  when are we dropping the lock on them, cman.  chuckie : when they hit that store.   okay, on the code word, we roll.  what is the word.  uh... "broccoli." i don't like it.  chuckie : think of another word.  i just don't like broccoli.  guys, this isn't about broccoli, it's about saving susie's money.  ready, harold.  in a sec.  angelica, before i go, i want you to have something to remember me by.  your retainer.  yuck.  now you'll have something to remember me byan overbite.  ah, angelica.  well, see you.  i can't wait to see dad's face when i tell him, "find someone else to shave grandpa's back.  i'm out of here." i don't know.  i'll miss the furry little guy.  whoa.  incoming.  hey.  no prob.  his moves ain't that sweet.    and they say skating isn't macho.   quick, we'll take the escalator and grab him as he's getting off.  what the....  grout.  i'm nailed to the rail.  i... can't... pull...  my... hand...  off.     ow....  wait.  susie: you know what your problem is, boys.  you've got to get in touch with your softer side.      cliff: come on, let's go.  but i don't like the dark.  oh, stop being a baby.  i'm looking for a light.  tommy: you want some light.  here you go.   my sockets are burning like rockets.  let's get her.    ha.  we got him now.  come and get me.  uhoh.  oh, it's small in here.  and it smells like feet.   it's a trap.  go back. go back.  oh, no, they're getting away.  not on my watch.    aah. hamsters.  i hate hamsters.    get them off, get them off.  get them off.      we did it.  and all thanks to chuckie.  where is chuckie.  uh, guys.   i guess your fearless leader took off without you.  how did you guys get out.  you forgot one little detail.   now, here's the new plan: we're going to walk out of here with her and the money.  chuckie: let my sister go.  come on, chuckie, don't be stupid.  who you calling chuckie.  cliff: ooh, nice move, but we still have the money.     you mean this money.  how the....  what's in here then.  kitty litter.   cliff: please don't call our dad.  he made me do it.  did not.  did too, stupid.  cliff: you're stupid.  oh, thank heavens you boys are safe.  oh, at first we just thought you missed curfew.  didn't know you were capturing two dangerous criminals.  what do you know.  i had two heroes for lunch and now i'm going to have me two heroes for dinner.   oh, i know it's been a lousy spring break for you kids, so first sunny weekend it's a trip to slosh mountain.   just so you knowit was really chuckie who was the hero.  i never would have had the guts, phil, if you didn't suggest sneaking into that movie.   you snuck into a movie.  what movie.  labyrinth guy, and boy, you were righti am not ready for a pg13 movie.  you kids saw a pg13 movie without permission.  : okay, no one say anything.  that's how angelica caught us and why we missed our curfew.  you missed your curfew to play in an unsupervised mall.  tommy, dil, wait till i get you home.  so does this mean the water park thing's out.  being a hero was nicewhile it lasted.   that was a close one.  sure glad i'm not a preteen anymore.  guard: hey.  who tried on all these shoes and didn't put them back..  run.   captioned by media access group at wgbh access.wgbh.orgxzbhp p9p=x0p9p= 0p9h.p= 0p9h.p= 0pp p= 0pp p= sp p= sp p= sp= s0p= @s0p= @s0p= @s0p=

sure destruction   help.   this is the theme song     for jimmy neutron.      and mtv television networks  but of all the ocean's mysteries...   ...my favorite is the haunting mating call of the humpback whale.   very good, carl.  ooh. oh, that wasn't a mating call, miss fowl.  butch just gave me a wedgie.  i want everyone to choose up partners for your oceanographyprojects.   hey, hey, don't fight over me, boys.  there's plenty of genius for everyone.  actually, jimmy, i'm still radioactive from last time we were lab partners.  yeah, and i still can't go near power plants.  oh... okay.  poor, speutron.  what's it like knowing no one wants to be your partner.  i don't know, cindy.  why don't you turn around and find out.   libby, what are you doing with britney..  nothing.  thisthis isn't the new mix master p cd.  i mean, i didn't promise to do britney's entire project in exchange for it if that's what you're thinking.  well, you two, it would seem you're the only ones left without partners.  let the record show that jimmy and cindy will work on their oceanography project together.     why, that new school bell is a real wakerupper.  ah, come on out, jimmy.  i've got fish snack 'emsthe great taste of fried seafood in a bag.  yeah, jimmy.  hiding from cindy isn't the answer.  not when reasonablypriced plastic surgery is so readily available.  jimmy: that won't be necessary, boys.  may i present my latest invention...  ...the neutron submersiblecapable of attaining undersea depths of 90,000 fathoms.  90,000 fathoms.  that's more than...  60,000 fathoms.  uh, jimmy, if you're going to start a new life under the sea can we have your stuff.  i'm not moving, carl.  i've simply devised a project so adventurous that cindy won't go anywhere near it.  allow me to explain using these infotaining visual aids.  two centuries ago, a pirate ship named theoozy scabhit a squall and sank to the bottom of retroville bay with a mysterious treasure chest.  no sub could ever get deep enough to retrieve it until today.  i'm finding that treasure.  listen, neutron.  i'm not any happier about being lab partners than you are so let's just classify some seashells and get it over with.  darn it all, cindy.  i wish i could join you in your fascinating seashell project, but i've already planned a dangerous search for a shipwreck in my extremely cramped submarine.  okay, i'm in.  what..  butbut... there will be sharks andand minimal leg room.  i think i can handle it.  now, we'll need some quality personnel to man the controls.  on second thought, you guys will do.  we sail at dawn.  jimmy: gentlemenand annoying female interloperby the end of this journey, we'll all be rich.  this is awesome, jimmy.  i've never been in a submarine before.  hey, jimmy, i found a cool video game starring a thin, green guy and his friend, mr. bleep bleep.  that's the radar, carl.  oh. well, my mom doesn't let us have radar.   if you three sea slugs are done fooling around maybe we can get down to work.  now, after researching the last known coordinates of theoozy scab,and accounting for 200 years of ocean drift i've been able to map out the wreck's probable location.  maps are old school.  i've invented something that'll make finding theoozy scaba nobrainer.  oh, yeah, here we go.  time to complicate a perfectly good plan with one of your goofy, unnecessary inventions.  you're just jealous 'cause jimmy's a genius.  go ahead, captain jimmy.  tell us about your goofy, unnecessary invention.  i give you the gill gab 9000the world's first fish translating device.  we just speak into the microphone and our words are translated into fish sonar allowing us to interview the fish and askthem where the treasure is.  and you wanted to use a map.  well, that is the lamest thing i've ever heard.  what dunderhead would want to talk to a bunch of stupid fish.  i want to talk to fish. i want to talk to fish.  give me that.  oh, hey, you little fellow.  hi.  do you like fish snack 'ems.  they're made from fish like you only cut up into little, bitesize pieces and deep fried in burning oil.   carl, you're supposed to ask about the treasure.  hey, you smelling pile of scales.  i knowyouknow where theoozy scabis so start singing before i go barracuda on you.  uh, maybei'lljust ask the questions, huh.  so, i says to him...  you want to know wh i says to him.  yeah, okay.  i says, "what's this blonde scale doing on your dorsal fin." wha.... uhhuh.  "have you been seeing that angel fish again."  and you know what he says.  i don't know what he says.  okay, okay. thanks a lot. bye.  got to go.  well,shewas a gold mine of information.  ready to admit your invention's a flop yet, neutron.  yeah, maybe cindy's right, jimmy.  we've been interviewing fish for hours.  and we'llkeepinterviewing them until i say so.  miss fowl maybe have made cindy my lab partner but it's still my ship.  you just can't deal with the fact that my plan's better than yours.  is not. is so.  is not. is so.  is not. is so.  stop it. stop it.  can't you see your constant fighting is tearing us all apart..    that was cool, carl.  i really believed you for a second.  : thanks.  i saw that on a soap opera once.   i'm tired, jimmy.  i want to go home.  you've been talking to fish all night.  do you even know where we are.  don't worry.  i made an automatic pilot system out of my mom's microwave.  it's been piloting the sub for hours.   whoops.  wrong setting.  well, we couldn't have drifted too far.  hmm.  anyone familiar with the sea of japan.  great.  nice going, neutron.  not onlyhaven't we found the treasure but now we'recompletelylost.  lost.. we can't be lost.  we only brought enough food for two days.  and i'm not eating carl.  well, i'm not eating you, either.  okay. maybe a bite. )
