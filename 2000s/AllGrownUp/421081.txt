 from here on in, boys, we leave civilization behind.  hope i can get the game on this.  look no furtheri found the perfect spot to set up camp.  nice work, dil, my boy.  waiti've got a better one.  with a view.  over... there.  number one.  now, this is the perfect spot.   dil: guys. over here.  check out the view.  you planned this, didn't you.  yeah, i planted the flowers months ago, but the guy in the deer costume was extra.    a little slice of heaven, isn't it, boys.  except for the skeeters.  but they got to eat, too.  nature fun fact: a dryer sheet under the belt wards off mosquitoes for hours.  i'll try anything once.  that's ridiculous.  fancy that.  works like a charm.  thanks for the helpful hint, dil.   ooh, i got something.   grandpa: what a beaut.  and your first time out of the gate, too.   uh...  grandpa: dil, you're a natural.  i have an advantage.  i speak fish.   you got to be kidding me.  whoa.  promise me you'll teach me how to speak fish one of these days.  be happy to.  it's a lot like turtle but with more lip.   i got a bite.  ha, i... hey, it's coming.  i got it, i got it.  dil: it's a little payback for littering.  the lake has eyes, bro.  the lake has eyes.  aw...   dil, that's our dinner.  sorry, i wouldn't feel comfortable feasting on our brethren of the lake.  we have a relationship now.      throw me that rope, will you, dil.  i'll do it.   isn't it a bit chilly for a swim.  : no, it's like bath water.  what. what is it.  : aah, leeches.    okay, nature boy, why don't you just talk these things off of me.   okay, sit up.  now beg.  good leech.  i'm hitting the woods.  why don't you two set up the tent.  it's mine, all mine.  congratulations, psycho.  where you going.  that's for me to know... and for me to know.  unbelievable.  sound structure, easy on the eyes...  you know, in all my years of camping, i've never seen anything like it.  yeah, thanks.  i thought you'd be into it.    i wasn't talking to you.   i got up early this morning to get breakfast started.  nothing specialeggs, bacon, pancakes, tiramisu.  sheesh, i haven't eaten this well since your greatgrandma's wake.  number one.  tiramisu. cheap shot.  oh, if we're talking cheap, you taking credit for my tepee was discount city.  tommy: i had no choice.  you kept showing me up, you and your leech talking.  how can i compete with that.  you can't, which is why you should settle for number two, because that's where you'll stay.  you think so, huh. i know so.  hey, isn't it time for a hike, grandpa.  hey, hey.  i'm still chewing here.  but seeing how gungho you two are, how can i say no.   let's see... which hike should we take.  i was thinking we hit the fivemiler.  really.  i was willing to go ten.  thirteen. fifteen.  whoa.  hey, don't forget there's an old guy in the mix.  dil and tommy: deadman's peak.  wait, let me read the fine print: "a difficult trek, length unknown "as no one's ever completed the hike "without a helicopter rescue.  all hikers must sign release forms upon entry." this is really what you guys want to do.  yep. you bet.  then who am i to be a wet blanket.  to deadman's peak.  where i can only hope false advertising is at play.   what's the matter.  having trouble keeping up with number one.  don't worry, you'll be coming in second, just like you always do.   tommy: let's make this hike interesting.  dil: make it so, brother man.  i'm going to finish this hike with only half a canteen of water.  i'll do it with a third.  no water.  no water and no food.  no flashlight, no sunscreen, no pocketknife.  no compass, no firstaid kit, no dryer sheets.  no shirt.  no shoes.  no socks.  no pants.  you're on your own with that one, bro.     stu.  this has gone far enough.  you and drew need to work this out asap.  oh, and don't worry about the tickets.  i'll take care of them.   a tie.  now what are we going to do.  we're all out of trail.  we'll forge a new one...  with our bare hands.  it's just crazy enough to work.   dead man reporting for duty.  boys: grandpa.   grandpa, are you okay.  we're... we're going in, soldiersfor milehigh pie.  what's wrong with him.  it looks like heat exhaustion.  and when the fighter planes flew over, i took cover under a cow.  no.  no more bologna sandwiches.   he needs food.  and water, i know.  oh, why did we throw our supplies away.  jungle fever.  we're in the woods.  woods fever.  we're idiots.   we have to get him to a hospital.  how.  i don't know.  maybe he'll be okay and he just needs to rest for a little while.  iviva la revolucin.   i'm losing my grip.  at least i warned you.   he'd be so much easier to carry if we could redistribute his weight.  if only we had a stretcher.  i'll find some branches.  and i'll find, uh, something that goes between the branches.    sticker bushes on the right.  thanks for the bottomsup, but after what we did to grandpa, we deserve to suffer.  ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.  i know what you mean.  both: ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.  there's my shirt...  and your shoes.  my pants.  hungry...  thirsty...  achy...  oh, hang in there, grandpa, we're on the case.  was he just smiling.  rubber biscuits.   you sure you want to do this.  absolutely.  what are we going to say happened.  spontaneous combustion.  both: accident.  well, let's put her out of our misery.   we shall never speak of this again.  nice dress.  nice shoes.  you want a straw.  right now, all i want is for grandpa to be okay.  that's all i want, too...  and maybe some pants.  i can't believe grandpa's in the hospital all because i wigged about not being his favorite.  people have done worse for less.  and hamsterswell, they don't do nothing for nobody.  not grandparents.  it seems like the older i get, the harder it is to talk to mom and dad, but with grandpa, it's different.  color me intrigued.  i can tell him anything and i won't be judged, yelled at or punished.  though sometimes i think it's because he's dozed off.  so that's why you went so aggro about being the favorite.  this grandparent thing is a sweet deal.  yep.  too bad he's never going to speak to us again.  yep.  tommy...  i need to ask you something.  why are we drinking coffee.  you watch soap operas.  that's what people do in waiting rooms.    man: the patient will make a full recovery if he doesn't exert himself for the next decade.   grandpa, i'm so sorry for being such a jerk on the fishing trip.  me, too.  i forgive you.  just like that.  no yelling.  no getting mad.  no punishment.  that's what grandparents are for.  sweet.  since you can't get mad because it's in your job description, mind settling something for us.  who is your favorite grandchild.  tell you what.  i'll write down the name, put it in an envelope, but it only be opened after i'm gone.  boys, the patient needs his rest.  bye, grandpa.  check you later, lou.   oh, when you first showed up, i knew you were up to something, lou.  teaching my grandsons a lesson.  faking an illness was the only thing i could do to get them to stop fighting.  well, it worked.  and here i was thinking we'd have to break out the fullbody cast again.   grandpa, you got to stay elevated.  here's your paper, some soup, ice cream and a laser pointer in case you get bored and want to point at some junk in the room.  there's been an accident.  with the car.  it's totaled. sorry.  do you have any idea how much that car was worth..  it was a piece of junk.  that "junk" was driven by elvis.  not only was it a collector's item, it was worth a fortune.  i can't believe you made us push it off a cliff.  it was your idea.  "come on, stu, let's make it disappear." you pushed it off a cliff.  stop getting him all worked up.  he almost died from heat exhaustion.  both: heat exhaustion.  i've... got to go out for a while.  sorry, boys, the heat exhaustion thing is a scam.  don't feel bad.  when we were kids, your dad and i fell for it, too.  told you he was smiling when he was unconscious.  that guy...  we promised grandpa we'd wait until he's gone to open this.  but he didn't say gone where.   what's she doing.   both: mom.  hey, dil, i got a letter.  a... a "g".  but neither one of us has a...   oh, no...  it couldn't be, could it.  his favorite is... angelica..   i refuse to accept that as fact.
