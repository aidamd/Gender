 chuckie: i'm telling you, tommy, we shouldn't have thrown reptar out like that.   betty: come on, finster, put some muscle behind it or you won't be ready for bathing suit season.  you're getting all bent here, chuckie.  that machine went nuts because of an electrical storm.  you didn't see the look in reptar's one good eye.   tommy, your mother and i wanted to cover some ground rules before leaving you kids alone tonight.  sure, dad,cinco minutos.  so, stuey, those the new gold mine i've been hearing about.  yep, let me give you a little demonstration.  this is large.   here's medium.  : and this is small.   a little help here.  ahh...  whoa.    you okay there, stuey.   never had that happen before.  i'm going to run some safety checks.  thanks for the heimlich.  see.  what are you sayingreptar caused that, too.  my dad's inventions are always a little funky.  remember prechewed chewing gum.  ugh, i'd rather not.  my mouth still tastes like someone else's.  see.  ah, maybe you're right.  what happened last night, it was probably just a freak accident.  all right, chuckers, let's sweat it till we get it.  chuckie, you okay..  howard.  betty: didn't i tell you to clean the garage.  what.   root beer, orange soda, lemonlime, oh, yeah.  this'll be a belch fest.   angelica: what is up with the kettle corn, boys.  ask dil.  i'm trying to see if i can pop it through mind control.  lil: give me that.  mind control, please.  i got you to make it, didn't i.  i don't want to miss a minute of this twohour yugottagospecial.  i hear the effects kick total butt.  and the clothes are pretty, too.  don't sweat it, lillian.  first they'll show the making of the twohour yugottagomovie.  then they'll show thebehind the scenes of the twohour yugottagomovie.  then there'll be abehind the scenes of a making of the yugottagomoviea director's cut.   dang, what a stink.  you should have let my brain do it.   oh, no.  it's happening.  what's happening.  it's the curse of reptar.  we found our old reptar toy and tossed him out.  now chuckie thinks reptar's mad at us.  that is, like, the lamest thing i've ever heard.  you guys probably just popped a breaker.  come on, they're in the basement.  you preteens are lucky your parents found someone my age around to figure these things out.  you know, she's right.  that may be the scariest thought all night.  i think it's over here.  oh, let me do thiswhoa.   what is this stuff.  uh... uh...  for the record, whatever it is, it isn't mine.  guys...  do you see what i see.  this isn't just any slime.  that slime's in the shape of reptar.   that's not reptar.  it is if you look at it like this.  oh, manit's reptar.  dil, five minutes ago you thought you could pop popcorn with your eyeballs.  i'm telling you, tommy, it's just like that movie we saw.  we unearthed reptar from his final resting place and now he's seeking his unholy revenge.  as the only mature one in this room right now, i have to say:" putting me on tommy's side, which is a first i'm not particularly proud of, so i'm going upstairs to get this yuck off me.  can we forget this.  there's ayugottago twohour special and i'm not going to miss it.  forget it, guysthe cable's gone out.   well, if that isn't a sign then i don't know what is.  dil: is it working now.  how about now.  is it working now.  it's official: i'm wigging.  me, too.  you guys, there's a storm, cable goes out.  it happens.  dil: is it working now.          ew. ew. ew. ew.  what is that stench.   that is definitely not mine.   what is going on here, pickles.  what is wrong with your house..  you bought this as a foreclosure, didn't you.  look, it's coming out here, too.  call your folks, tommy.  i've been trying, but the line's dead.  do you believe me now. huh. huh.  we need to get reptar back in his grave or face his wrath forever.  hate to say it, but i'm with the cman on this one.  what if there is a "curse of reptar." you guys watch too many scary movies.  what's nexta guy in a hockey mask and an ax crashes through the door.   wanted to tell you, i got the korean station loud and clear.  okay, look, there's still a chance we might get to see this yugottagospecial.  if it would make everybody feel better, let's get reptar and we'll put him down for a nice, long dirt nap.   maybe if we shoved him in a shoe box.  this feels so disrespectful.  forget it.  just get that lizard wannabe and throw him in the hole.  it's freezing cold out here.   reptar's gone.    tommy: ah, i can't believe you talked me into this, chuckie.  yuck.  the supervisor said they divide up the trash by neighborhood.  reptar's got to be in here somewhere.  then the pile over there must be from someplace real swank because it's only got half the noxious gases.  so why'd you even come, angelica.  are you kidding.  don't you know it's always the gorgeous girl with the bouncy hair who never makes it to the end of the movie.  i'd be a goner.  this must be the johnson's trash.  they only eat cheese and broccoli.  who knew the world of waste management was so fascinating.  just think, if that heavyequipment gig doesn't wo out, all this could be mine.  why notit looks like your room.  all rightwho in the neighborhood uses tuna that's not "dolphin safe." i'm kicking patoot and taking names.  that's it, i'm done.  we've looked for hours, i'm going home.  but tommy, what about reptar.   chuckie, if there's any curse of reptar...  it's that you don't want to let him go and grow up.  phil: hey, over here.  i found him.  he was under a box of buffalo wings.  what.  they were still warm.  well...  goodbye, old buddy.  even though i didn't think about you once in the last five years, i'll miss you.  can you speed this up, we're all getting soaked.  it's okay.  here goes.   i can't, i can't, i can't.   oh, just ditch the doll, would you, finster.  oh, give him to me, i'll do it.  step away from the reptile, angelica.  now, i know to you guys reptar may not mean a lot, but he does to me.  he was once my favorite toy, and if i remember right, he was your guys', too.  the first movie we saw wasreptar.  he was our first cereal, our first snack bar.  our first ice show was "reptar on ice."  you guys went to see an ice show.   reptar even gave me a mom.   oh.  and a sister.  if we hadn't gone to reptar land, my dad wouldn't have met kira and kimi.  and i wouldn't be here with you right now.  i know i'm supposed to want to grow up, but maybe i don't want to do it as fast as you guys.  i'm sorry, chuckie.  i completely forgot what reptar meant to you.  maybe we should keep him after all.  are you crying, phillip.   no.  so it's decidedwe keep reptar.  whoa. whoa.   cool.    here, if the powers of evil want him so bad, you can keep him.    ah, jeez, uh...  i'm sorry, there, mr. and mrs. pickles, but it seems the backhoe hitting your house loosened your foundation.  well, i'm not paying for it.  stu... please.  that certainly explains the hole in the floorboards, and the seeping walls, and the power problems, but what about the gunk in the pipes.  foundation broke the water main.  20 years of backwash just got sucked right in there.  ew.  well, i'm not paying for it.  well, that's nice and all, but we're not liable for damage caused by "force of nature." i'll show you the contract you signed.  uh, excuse me a minute...   i don't know why, but i've been packing 'em on like crazy lately.  you know, i might be able to help you there.  of course... if you make it worth my while.  let me introduce you to a little item i call gorge n' grow.  chuckie: so there wasn't any curse of reptar after all.  well, what do you know about that.  well, good night.  that's it.  after scaring everyone half to death, that's it.  oh, yeah... sorry.  i'm going to miss reptar, though.  but maybe it is time we grow up.  i don't think we have a choice.  you still think we'll get the pool, t.  because i was thinking of expanding my sanctuary and calling it "habitat for manatee." pool, yes.  marine mammals, no.   reptar. reptar.      there you go, boy.  couldn't leave you out here all by yourself in the cold.

radioactive chemical in the hair spray caused nesting bees to growa hundred times their normal size.     what a stellar night.  just the way i ordered it.  perfect weather, a million stars in the sky and a movie's that's just bad enough to be funny.  we need to talk.  my family's moving.  whew, dodged a bullet there.  i thought you were breaking up with me.  isn't that kind of the same thing.  oh, yeah... guess it is.  so when are you moving.  tomorrow.  tomorrow..  that's like the day after today.  how long have you known.  a few weeks.  i was afraid to tell you.  so... this is our last night together.  : i'm not good with goodbyes, so i'm just going to say ...bye.   isn't that kind of the same thing.   want a ride to your hair appointment.  aren't you going to get dressed.  what's the point.  i'll just have to change back into pajamas in a few hours.  mom, you're losing it.  no.  i already lost it, the best job i ever had, and they pruned me like a dwarfing perennial.  snip, snip.  you need something to do.  girl: don't get impatient.  chillax bro, it's just a game.  that's it.  you can market dil's game.  impatience is a staple of entertainment at the java lava.  nah, i've played it before, and frankly, i don't have the patience for it.  everyone loves it.  i hate this dumb game.  want to play again.  okay.  see. that's the beauty of it.  you can yell, scream, break stuff, and blame it all on the game.   you just might be on to something.  breakup supplies, huh.  yep. i'm just gonna sit here, eat junk food, watch sad movies, cut rachel out of all my pictures...  and then quietly collapse in a pool of my own tears and vomit.  handball can wait.  this i got to see.   um...  oh... that's it, i got nothing.  really.  i know this seems weird, but i feel fine.  no offense, t, but i was sort of looking forward to the pool of tears and vomit thing.   aunt charlotte.  d.p., i have a proposition for you.  color me intrigued.  in brief, there's a hole in the market for a game like impatience.  i believe i can turn your odd, yet compelling little game into an international best seller.  no, thanks.  that game is my baby.  i don't want her to be exploited.  i can see it now.  little german boys in lederhosen huddled around the game, screaming at one another, tiny dutch children throwing clogs.  together, d.p., we can make the whole world impatient.  still not interested.  i'll play you for it.  let's do it.      your heels may be high, but your hands are callused and swift.  just sign by the green arrows, initial by the yellow ones.  charlotte pickles is back.  look out world, here i come.  phil: who am i kidding.  i can't eat.  i'm too upset about the breakup.  me, too.  poor rachel.  poor tommy.  oh. get off me.  how can you eat at a time like ts.  i can't with my lunch in the trash.  you don't have to hide your pain.  i know how hard a breakup can be.  i've been down that road with wally, and getting dumped hurts...  like dipping your heart into a tank of hungry piranhas.  she didn't dump me, she moved.  so now it's over, and i'm moving on.  besides, i've been thinking.  why rush the girl thing.  i'm young, i need to be free.  i'm not buying it. me neither.  you know me better than anybody, right, chuckie.  do i look upset to you.  absolutely not.  thank younow that's settled.  he's in total denial.  yep, and if he refuses to embrace his pain, this could get ugly.  like tommy to be strong for the rest of us.  tears of a clown, man.  don't worry, buddy, we're there for you.  what are you doing in my class.  someone in your stage of grief isn't in the head space to take notes.  noodle soup...  for your soul.  you didn't doubleknot.  get some rest, tommy, we've got your chores covered.  i told you, i'm fine.  i'm young, and i need to be free.  that's right.  keep saying it until the crying little boy inside you believes it.  "sorry for your loss.  love, chuckie, phil, lil, and kimi."  )
