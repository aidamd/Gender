see.  well, look, chuckie.  what do you see.  : a silver dollar.  look at me.  i'm stealing pennies from a fountain.  how many children's wishes have i destroyed.  i just wanted to feel like a winner, so that for once i'd feel like somebody.  tommy, i could have been the crimson destroyer.  youaresomebody, to us.  you're the best big brother.  we're here for you, chuckie.  i'll treat you to a zebra

there for each other for the bad times then what kind of friends are we.  don't worryi didn't tell anyone what was in your diary.  oh... well...  see you.  yet.  okay... what do you want.  chuckie sold all his stamps for cards.  that store won't give them back.  we'll see about that.  angelica: jonathan, my mother is cfo of the company that distributes those cards and she'll make your life a living nightmare.  mmmmy name's fred.my demands, you can say sayonara to yugottago cards and to your customers.  do you really do all that.  no...  but they don't know that.   i don't know what to say, you guys, except i am off yugottago forever.   keep walking.  just keep walking.  chas: what are you doing there, chuckie.  ah, just putting some junk awayforever.  i've been thinking, dad.  can we go to the post office.  the new commemorative stamps came out today.  oh, chuckie, i didn't think you were interested.  why, you betcha.  how about after the post office, we snag some ice cream.  and let's throw fate to the wind: vanilla with sprinkles.  dad, why are you smiling like that guy who talks to trees.  i know you had your heart set on them, so here: your very own yugottago cards.  chuckie : the redmirrored dragon.  captioned by media access group at wgbh access.wgbh.orgy a8hxy ap:0ixzb8hyhrp:ph hh0/ @h  with superpowered mind, a mechanical canine     he rescues the day from sure destruction   help.   this is the theme song     for jimmy neutron.      and mtv television networks listen up.  what we have before us today is a race.  this race, once started, shallnotstop for any reason.  if you trip, you will be trampled.  if you stumble, you will be trampled.  if you refuse to trample, you will be trampled.  on your mark...    : lungs... straining....  underwear... chafing...   go, sheen.  ooh... ii'm floating...  the light.  yes, move toward the light. oh...  just passing through, libby.  hey, sheen, have you seen my back.  no.  well, check it out.  hey.   you're going down, neutron.  oh, please, if you run half as well as your report on the timespace continuum i already beat you 2,000 years ago.  take it to him, girlfriend.  you got it, jimmy.  no pressure, but for the love of humanity...  don't lose.  isn't that big head getting a little heavy, neutron.  haha. that's really funny, cindy.  after i cross the finish line remind me to fake a laugh.   hey, jimmy, you know the only thing worse than you losing this relay race.  what's that, vortex.  losing to a girl.    quick, trample him. trample him before he gets up.  you call that running.  my grandma's faster.  race you to the lockers, jimmy.   dad: ah, don't let it get you down, jimjam.  i lost all sorts of races when i was your age.  but i turned out okay, huh.  well, sure, the tramplings left a scar or two but i'm basically all right.  i think what your father's trying to say, jimmy is that losing's not important as long as you try your best.  look, this one's shaped like president grover cleveland, in his second term.  well, i've had enough losing for one week.  that's why, at this very moment, shoebot is coating my sneakers with a mixture of thermalsilicone and my allpurpose, endlessly adaptable compound neutrogunk.  the resulting combination should create a propulsive yet frictionless environment around my sneakers that will power me to victory.  but won't the combustion cycle become increasingly irregular due to the inhibiting effect of the silicon's thermal resistance.  huh.  don't worry, mom.  it's just going to be one quick experimentbut, oh, so satisfying.   )
