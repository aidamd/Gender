 someone's going to get it.  oh, please.  what am i going to have to take care of this time.  the dishes.  no, the diapers.   .  we've got another one for you.  have fun.   oh, big deal.  how bad can it be.     angelica, what are you doing.  you said take care of the diapers.  meaning put them all in the bag, tie it up, and leave it on the porch.  we have a diaper service.    this is too good.   but couldn't you just stick it out a few more days.  no.  i cannot stick it out a few more days.  whoa. girl on the edge.  and do i smell... dirty diapers.   forget it...  because... i'm getting out.  angelica pickles admits defeat, and no amount of familial loyalty is going to stop me.  well, i guess it's about that time.  time. what time.  to quit.  i checked with susie.  she said there was no way you were going to make it.  susie said that.  mmm... that's why i bet against you.  so... thanks awfully for quitting.  no way i was going to make it, huh.  floor.  what's going on.  word to the wise, susie: never count angelica pickles out.  ever.  dwayne: quit touching me.  i'm not touching you.  yes, you are, peaches.  no, i'm not, dwayner.  dad.  : dad.   : oh, my gosh.  what's that.  where. what.  get it off me.  hey, peaches, no fair.  angelica: you snooze, you lose.  family rule.   she's getting good.  no, she isn't.  yes, she is.  look at this creaseand it's terrycloth.  i sensed your ennui with my previous game choices, so i brought along one of my own.  dil, i'm impressed.  you invented this.  yeah.  looks like the nut doesn't fall far from the tree.  i call it "annoyance." i'm hoping that after some tweaking, i can market it.  what's the object of the game.  to keep cool.  if you lose your temper, you're out.  i'm talking real 21stcentury stuff.  nothing fazes me.   all right, where do we start.  right on top.    see how that vein is starting to bulge on uncle drew's forehead.  could be just us two.  sweet.   but you said she was caving.  now i'll have to take chuckie's shift at the java lava, and it's sea kelpgarlic smoothie month.  you've got to do something.  if i lose, i have to clean tommy's room for six months, even under the bed, and no one's ever cleaned under there.  do you think i'm going to let angelica beat me at my own game in my own house.  she thinks she's got chores now.  just wait.   ooh...  busted.  there is no way i'm letting angelica win.  are you with me.  or should i just stencil "loser" on your foreheads.  but if we help you, that would be dishonest, cheating.  and i've got a much better chore for the queen of mean.  okay, okay, my turn.     whwhat... huh.  .   time to get up.  saturday... day off...  checked chore list last night.  oh, you only checked the weekly one.  the monthly one is on my desk.  "angelica," "angelica," "angelica." of course, if you want to quit...    not bad.  so, i'm done, right.  normally, but because this is the third sunny saturday in a row, the second one out of bed cleans the rain gutters.  with this.  family rule.  wow.  look what the kids did.  they even alphabetized the spices.  do you think we have them so well trained that....  they're freaks of nature.   and then she said i had to clean them with a toothbrush.  buster came up with that one.  did not.  did, too.   enough.  not only was making up a chore list unfair, but it was downright dangerous.  yeah, you tell them.  and i haven't heard an apology yet.  you said it, sister.  sorry, peachesno harm intended.  same here.  really sorry.  okay...  i'm sorry, too.  it was all my idea, so...  you should punish me.  you're all punished.  grounded for a month.  ooh, ouch.  that was harsh, but frankly, you deserve it.  angelica, anytime you want to go home, you feel free.  you've more than survived the carmichael household.  yes.  i'll clean. i'll cook.  out of here.  i'm really going to miss that girl.  she could get the mildew out of grout like nobody's business.  now, i'm fairly certain it's the person who rolls the number that's most easily divisible by three who gets to go next.  aunt charlotte.  i'm really starting to miss our little one.  steady my hand for me, will you, drew.  you're, uh, asking the wrong person.  i'm back and better than ever.   i win.  princess.  oh, have we missed you.  what are you doing here.  just acting as the putty that keeps this family together.  well, beat it.  their real putty is back.  my job here is done.  honey, i never thought you'd make it this long.  they couldn't break me.  oh, they tried, but every chore they threw at me, i mastered.  i even learned a few things.  like what, sweetheart.  like bleach is a great mold killer, and there's actually a bag inside a vacuum cleaner.  and...  and i never knew how easy i had it here.  it seems only fair that for surviving a week at the carmichaels' and learning a valuable lesson, you should be rewarded.  you can order in whatever you want for dinner.  and watch whatever you want on tv.  new pickles family rule: we all make dinner and sit down and eat together.  together.  together, and discuss our day.  well, what's the holdup.  well, nothing.  coming, princess.  first off, all cell phones and pagers off.  dad, you make the salad.  hey, i could make my famous caesar.  mom, i'll need help kneading the meatloaf.  meat... loaf.  so, how was your day, mom.  well, i got a new investor for charlotte, inc.  really.  that's great, mom.  and you, dad.  oh, nothing, really.  oh, oh, oh.  well, i parred three holes in golf today.  good for you, honey.  now, angelica, tell me more about this loaf of meat.  captioning sponsored by the u.s. department of educationxzghxzbhjq 9hphxp8q 9hphxpq 9h8xzq 9bhpq 9hxdbh(](] (](](] (]@ got to blast.   into the stars, goin' by candy

   judy: whew.  what a day.  i did the shopping, i reshingled the roof...  that's nice, dear.  yeah, that's great, mom.  hugh: mmhmm.  here are your dinners.  a ham and macaroni choochoo for hugh with cauliflower chimney smoke.  for jimmy, scallopini pfeffernuss with mashed potatoes in the shape of einstein's hair.  and for me, a sandwich.    jimmy, did you hook up your experiential hydraulic

well, since you asked, i'm going to a spa for a week to be pampered unmercifully.  hughsydoodles is confused.  i'm sick of being unappreciated and doing all the work around here.  here are the chores i do every week to keep this place up and running.  you two are going to have to do them while i'm gone.  goodbye.   whoa.  no mom for a week.  no one to tell us "your bath is ready".  or make us change clothes.  or make us leave the lab and come to dinner.  no one to tell us "you can't have pizza for every meal" or say, "hugh, put down that duck and talk to me for once." we're free men.  masters of our own destiny.  we rule this house.  we, uh... once we finish the chores.  oh. yeah.  what's the first one.  hugh: now, jimmy, should we sponge, then squeegee, then dry.  or squeegee, then sponge, then dry.  ordry, then sponge, then squeegee, or...    okay, you're the genius.  plunge head first screaming, then sponge, then dry.    if i'm such a genius, why are we doing this work ourselves.  because your mother told us to.  she just wants it done.  she doesn't care whoor whatdoes it.    goddard, install "list of chores" program.  check.  lastly, my maternal chip with the

hours this evening.  good work, maternotron.  assume sleep mode until the next mealtime.  negativea mother's work is never done.  a mother must protect and pamper.  oh. oh, right.  override maternal chip directives until further notice.  don't use that tone with me, young man.  now, eat.  leaping leptons.  i said water the lawn, not cook it.  what is this stuff.  soy protein, kelp, talapala oil and spinach for flavor.  sugarbooger's dinners never smelled quite so...  oh, how do i put it.  disgusting.  this is the train and your mouth is the tunnel.  uh, no, thanks.  see, my tunnel is temporarily closed for...  i must have set the autonomy parameter in the mothering chip too high.  she really thinks she's mom.  and after dinner... your baths.   maternotron: hold still.   hugh: not
