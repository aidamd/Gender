 this is a total bust.  how are we gonna see alien innards if our grandpas won't act like normal grandpas and pass out on the couch.  i don't get it.  why do grandpa lou and grandpa boris hate each other anyway.  don't know.  some big family mystery.  w about mac and cheese for dinner, kids.  junk food.  you don't know what's good for kids.  i know how to feed children and make them grow.  didn't work for you.  the only thing that grows on you are your ear lobes.  i know.  i'll make my scottish grandmother's haggis.  that'll put meat on your bones.  what's haggis.  as if i really want to know.  piping hot sheep stomach filled with heart, kidney, lung and oatmeal.  both: ew.  i'll call the hospital, reserve some rooms.  you see that.  that's not what kids want to eat.  ask them.  which would you boys rather havedelicious, nutritious beets and cabbage...   and maybe a nice pickled tongue, or a stinky old haggis.  um, maybe a little of both.   i'll get it. i'll get it.  no, i'll get it.  you kids enjoy your dinner.  i didn't want to say anything in front of boris, but that tongue didn't look very fresh.  now, i'm not saying you'll get explosive diarrhea, but...  boris: look who's joining us.  i thought we were here to see an alien autopsy, not eat one.  alien autopsy.  : you oldies.  alien autopsy is a new underground dance move that's sweeping the nation.  show 'em, t.  alien, yes.  autopsy.  huh. yo.  no offense, t, but just keep that in the kitchen.  just eat up so we can get to the video.  mmm.  man, this haggis is incredible.  think you could make more.  all right.  who's ready to see an alien get it's sternum ripped open.  ugh. maybe you guys can watch it and give me the highlights tomorrow. eh.    what are you kids doing.   we're just gonna play some video games, grandpa.  okay.  okay.  you're gonna let them rot their brains with those video games.  i'll entertain them myself.  no, no, grandpa.  that's okay, we don't want to be entertained.  do we, guys.   what do you know from entertainment.  you're from cleveland.  everyone knows all the best entertainers come from vladivostok.  i could out entertain you any day, any place.  oh, yeah. yeah.  we'll let the kids judge who's got more talent.  everyone in the living room.   . dang, dang, dang, dangdang, dang, dangdang .  . dangdang, dangdang, dang, dang. .  now, this is a talent, passed down from generations of pickles, going back to the early pioneers.  yeeha.  feh. you call that hillbilly music entertainment.  hak mir nicht in tchainik.  a shtik fleish mit tzvei eigen.  a sof.  a sof.  what the heck is this.  it's yiddish theater, you redneck.  kids, just wait.  i'll be right back.  i picked this up from my great uncle, the sideshow carnie.  the trick is to stay completely focused on...       what are we gonna do.  we only have this tape till 10:00.  i say we knock 'em out with something blunt.  you're kidding, right.  yeah. of course.   let's take a... an intermission.  : i'm... i'm pooped.  : tired... already.  i haven't even brushed off my "a" material yet.  while you two are relaxing, we'll just go downstairs and play that educational video game.  but you haven't voted.  that's right.  now, who's a better entertainer, me or shmendrick.  you were both equally... entertaining.  right, guys. you betcha.  right. two thumbs up.  i liked the spoon act.  boris: what.  they're just spoons.  der ferklumptnicht isis a... a centuries old tale of love and redemption.  you'referklumptnicht.   let's just forget it, dil.  they're never gonna fall asleep.  we can't forget it.  why not.  uh... there's something i forgot to tell you.  what else did you forget to tell me..  that i invited ten kids to come over and watch the tape with us. what..  i thought we were keeping this on the low.  hey, that was just the "a" list.  we're not showing the tape to ten kids, dil.  mom put me in charge.  i'm responsible for what happens.  hey, you okay, t man.  uh... er... nothing i can't handle.  it looks like a stress rash to me.  is that like psoriasis.  no.  this is psoriasis.   yeah, you guys are gonna make it through an alien autopsy video.  i have an idea.  they both like to play poker, right.  if we can get them to play, they'll be distracted for hours and we can sneak everyone downstairs.  i don't know how to play poker.  good. the faster we lose, the faster we sneak away.  eh, read 'em and weep, amigos.  : we're supposed to lose, phillip.  what can i say.  i'm hot.  okay, seven card stud hilo.  i fold.  i fold.  i fold.  let's see...  phillip folds.  well, looks like it's just grandpa lou and grandpa boris, the two bad boys of poker.  you ready to get spanked.  like to see you try.   tommy: ah, i thought we'd never get away from them.  dil: if i could just take a moment to say a few words about the alien who gave his life for the advancement of science and thousands of dollars in mail order video sales.  mr. alien, though i never knew you...  just start it.  okay, okay.  okay, who needs popcorn or barf bags.  i'll take some of each.  quiet.  it's starting.  lillian, is that actual drool coming out of your mouth.  no.   just static, cman.  boris : no one accuses me of dealing from the bottom of the deck.  lou: stop cheating, and i'll stop accusing.  just ignore them.     you're going down, shmendrick.  me.  you don't know who you're dealing with.  i was wrestling champ back in high school.  ha. back in the old country, i used to wrestle bears.  that's because you are one, you hairy animal.    old man boobs.  this might actually be grosser than an autopsy.   this is your fault, dil.  you have to stop them.  i am not touching them.  besides, mom put you in charge.    oh, no.  that must be the ten kids you weren't supposed to invite.  ooh. i'll let them in. no.   back off.  i'm going in.       they never got very far    walls up made sure i guarded my heart    and i promised    i wouldn't do this    til i knew it was right for me    but no one  no one    no guy that i met before    could make me  make me    feel so right and secure    and have you noticed    i lose my focus    and the world around me disappears    'cause when i'm kissing you my senses come alive    almost like the puzzle piece i've been tryna find    falls right into place you're all that it takes    my doubts fade away when i'm kissing you    when i'm kissing you    it all starts making sense    and all the questions i've been asking in my head    like are you the one    should i really trust    crystal clear it becomes when i'm kissing you    i've never felt nothing like this    you're making me open up    no point even tryna find this    'cause when i'm kissing you my senses what's the hold up.  we want to see the tape.   chuckie, you go out and stall them while we figure out what to do. why me.  because you're so good with crowds.  oh, thanks.  wait, i'm not good with crowds.  adangdadangdadangdang...   adadadada, dadangdadang.  this is a disaster.  my house was trashed.  the tape was destroyed.  it's over.  what are you saying.  we came here for nothing.  we ate haggis for nothing..  dil: uh...  there's one little detail i forgot to tell you.  what. what..  what did you forget to tell me this time, dil.. what.  well, i'm not exactly supposed to have the tape.  i thought you were the gobetween.  i was, but i didn't actually go.  i just betweened.   you mean you stole it.  wow, you're like a criminal.  as long as we get the tape back by 10:00, we'll be fine.  spine snapper sleeps during the day.  you stole it from a guy named spine snapper.  and i'm the one who's going to get beat up for it.  no, i am.  it's a rule.  they always beat up the older brother.  i can't believe you, dil.  this always happens.  you come up with some stupid, harebrained scheme, and it always becomesmyproblem.  whoa, hey, don't do anything rash.   bad choice of words.    dil: hey, watch it.  a volf farlirt zayne hor, ober nit zayn natur.  ich vel dir geben a khamalye.  he's speaking alien.  awesome.   hey, hey, hey. stop it.  you're acting like babies.  we'reacting like babies.  what about you.  look at yourselves.  look at what you've done to this place.  they're right.  what's up with all this bad blood, anyway.  you want to know what this shmendrick did to me.  what i did to you.  you're the one who started this whole thing.  oh, yeah.  how. i'll tell you exactly how.  you... uh...  you tell me what i did to you.  okay.  um... i can't remember.   i'm glad you can have this nice moment, but i've got ten angry kids outside waiting to see an alien autopsy, a guy named spine snapper on my case, and this burning itch.  alien autopsy.  now, you boys know those alien tapes are all galashnigazoont.  if by that you mean fake, grandpa, you may be on to something.  if you gentlemen would be willing to lend your bodies to science...  color me intrigued.  you think an alien with body hair is believable.  keep your mouth shut.  you're taking me out of the moment.  that looks great, guys.  let's roll 'em.  action.  we're ready to begin the procedure.  i'm making an incision in the lower...   stop laughing.  i can't help it.  it tickles.  cut. sorry.  i'm okay.  let's go again.  everybody ready.  alien autopsy, take two.  action.  i'm making an incision in the lower...  ferkinschnackel.   we can see that the alien's sploink is clearly shaped like a ripe banana.   way to go, pickles.  you cracked this alien thing wide open.  so to speak.  that was so cool. awesome.  unbelievable. gnarly, dude.  that was one hairy alien.  who would've thought.  great save, dil.  inspired in fact.  'twas nothing.  sorry to make you bat clean up all the time, t.  ah, it's okay.  that's what older brothers are for.   the tape, pickles.  hand it over.  here you go.  no harm, no foul.  right, mr. spine snapper, sir.  this ain't it.  you're dead, dil's older brother.  whwhy me.  i always beat up the older brother.  it's a rule.  see..  take your hands off my grandson.  lou: you heard the man.  scram.  : are you kidding me.    old man boobs.  thanks, grandpas.  now, come on inside and help us clean that mess up before your parents come home.  well, i guess we'll never know if it was a real alien autopsy tape.  when i was in the army, i was stationed at area 51.  i could tell you stories about aliens.  captioned bymedia access group at wgbh access.wgbh.org y a c0]hphy cxpyh8h  hh qxh8pxoxhh (]xxrhz :xrhz :xx hzxhhzxhzxhzxhz @hz @hzphz hz hzz88xhx8 got to blast.   into the stars, goin' by candy bar's    rides a kid with a knack for invention     with a superpowered mind, a mechanical canine     he rescues the day from sure destruction   help.   this is the theme song     for jimmy neutron.      deon  ultralord, defender of the galaxy, is proud to present his new sidekick, doctor science.  give it up, peeps.  sheen, i'm not your sidekick.  don't like the name.  how about "smarty boy."
