ready to blow.    see. and my big solo's in two days.  i can't believe this is happening to me.  karma.  karma.  karma...  what's karma.  tommy: it's payback for something mean and selfish you've recently done...  or did... or are going to do.  me..  i haven't done anything that's mean or selfish.  someone can get you for that.  dil: not someone, but the whole cosmic realm.  i should have guessed this was your idea, alien boy.  where do you get this baloney.  books.  the library.  i'm yawning.  look, my karmaif i have oneis just as good as any of yours, maybe better.    : oh. i have bad karma.  aah.  listen up, karma king.  i have to sing in front of the student body and i can't do it wearing the washington monuzit.  get me some major karma.  whoa. doesn't work that way.  you can't fix problem skin with karma.  try astringent.  why not.  i did something bad and i woke up with this.  just undo the bad thing you did.  and lose my big solo.  youarecrazy.  tell me what to do to get my hands on some karma and i'll do it.  uh... be a good person.  okay, excellent, i'm on it.  i need specifics.  okay.  see ryan rodriguez.  dil: tell him he looks good in his bolo tie.  and risk social ridicule.  i was voted biggest slave to fashion.  i couldn't.  all right, watch me.  hey, ryan, ace accoutrement.  how'd you do that.  do what.  that lightglowwarmth thing.  that's the fuzzy feeling you get when you do good or when you clean out your ear with a cheez doodle.  oh, brother.  so, how do you know it's working, that you're racking up karmic swag.  you don't.  you just know you've done a good thing.  okay, now me.  hey.  have a cheez doodle.  oh. you couldn't look more... human.  i'msoproud.   that's it, e getting out of this.  you with me, phil.  : oh.   feel

angelica: it's not fair.  i should get extra credit for doing good deeds because i don't enjoy them.  that makes sense in a twisted martianlogic way.  now can you explain lightyears to me.  it does.  then with all the karmic goodies i've done today, tomorrow i should be looking like my old selfbeautiful, talented and perfect.  and she thinks i'm two eggs short of a frittata.    i'm a diva of the nth degree    so get out of my way and just...     givv..hphs.  crunchy todawj. ppcrjgchyesterjy.  z zooh.  theyy)e badl8 8qfor hllfweetness.  n.bark.  saveelxjrself, tasty.  qq [): just lay it on

aboriginal dancers from bora bora are having a fit because we didn't put bottled water in their dressing rooms.  so be ready in ten minutes.  and lose the bandages.  this is no time to set some crazy fashion trend.  susie.  these are for you.  i felt so bad accusing you of lying.  i thought you'd like them.  oh.   oh, susie, ididlie.  i knew your machine broke.  i should have called again. i'm sorry.  i don't know why i do these things, but now i'm being punished for it with this.  ow. ow. ow.  whoa, man, those are some honkers.  i can't go on like this.  please, would you do the solo.  please.  i don't know.  it would serve you right to have to go on stage with mount zitsuvius.  but... it wouldn't be good karma.  so...  thank you. thank you.  you know about karma.  suredoesn't everybody.  chuckie : where there is art, there is life.   elemental... like fire.       or... breaking wind in the trees.     i'd like to thank ms. o'keats for that enchanting performance piece.  and for our final performance, one of our most gifted students, miss susie carmichael.    look in the mirror, tell me what i see    all of the things that i could be    empty page in an open book    so color me so vividly.    i'm a wave in the ocean, the sunset on the sea    all the power of the mountains is the force that lives in me    the fire in the dragon to fill an empty heart    not so sure where i'm going    but this is where i start...      there you are.  oy. oh, no.  let us go.  i know you probably want to dash out of here because you're embarrassed by tonight's performance.  "humiliated" is more like it.  i know, and it's all my fault. i should've rehearsed you more.  i'll know better for the spring arts festival next week.   but the truth is, you kids stuck with me when no one else did, and for that i will always remember you.  oh, honey, what happened.  stage fright get you.  nothese.  well, no one would have noticed a little...  oh, who am i kidding.  there isn't enough coverup in the world.  are you okay.  actually, i'm better than that.  i made a lot of people happy tonight, and it felt really... well, good.  oh, that's my girl.  tomorrow i'll call my dermatologist.  man's a genius.  you can go to a doctor for these things.  karma has nothing to do with them.  you can't get them from being bad.  of course not.  who gave you a silly idea like that.  dil. you're a dead man.  captioned by media access group at wgbh access.wgbh.org 9y(]@@@   xo xo xo xo xo h08 h . he rescues the day from sure destruction .  . this is the theme song .  . for jimmy neutron. .     captioning sponsoredby nickelodeon sheen: ultralord soars majestically through the sky knowing he's made the world safe for sheenkind.  but wait, what's that.  i see wind blowing from the frozen layer of dr. lipbe.  ultralord can't maintain altitude.  he's plummeting to the ground.  no.  ouch.  : son, must you belt your father with tiny flying men.  sorry, dad, but flying ultralord is all i have.  swimming ultralord is rusted and tunneling ultralord suffered a wormrelated mishap.  i brought you here to learn air conditioning, so that one day this company can be "estevez & son." air conditioning's boring.  if ultralord needed cooling, he would shoot freeze charges from his elbows like in episode 212, ultralord versus the cajun chefs.  here you go, son.  carl: a paperclip sculpturewow, thanks, dad.  you're the best dad in the whole world.  here, son, an actual rotary coil with the original grease.  no, thanks.  i only play with licensed ultralord products.  i understand.  hey, son, what do you say we knock off for the day and play cards or checkers or polish our shoes until the shine is blinding.  uh, gee, dad, uh, i've kind of got homework to do, so...  jimmy: sheen. carl.  ready to seeultralord franchise film number 24.  it's the same asultralord franchise film number 23 but with eight minutes of new footage.  eight glorious minutes.  see you, dad.  how can i ever compete with this ultralord.  sheen: and then when ultralord vanquished the terrordroids and they used footage from the last movie with the three terrordroids and digitally added a fourth, i thought i'd jump up and hug the screen.  you di hello, boys.  did you enjoy the cinema.  did we ever.  ultralord is the coolest superhero in all history.  oh, he's good, but i know a superhero who is better than ultralord.  : better than ultralord.  your words are strange and confusing.  well, i'm not supposed to reveal this...  but it is i myself.  you. you. you.  yes, i am...  el magnfico.  well, uh... sure is hot out here.  can i get you some water, mr. estevez.  i am el magnfico.  look, here's a picture.  jimmy: yeah.  well, uh...  irrefutable photographic evidence.  now, about that water.  come on, dad.  if you're a superhero, prove it.  let's see some powers.  i... um...  well, i, uh...  i'd be happy to show you, uh...  tomorrow.  at noon.  uh, i, uh... i got to go.  okay, that was weird.  these should last through my experiments.   jimmy: mr. estevez.  jimmy, please, i need your help.  you've got to give me superpowers by noon tomorrow or my son will despise me.  sheen says you're a science whiz, so, pleasewhiz.  well, uh, i'd love to help, but giving you superpowers would go completely against scientific protocol.  please, jimmy.  all any father wants from his son is respect.   hugh: it's okay, everybody, just a little piebased accident.  how long can meringue burn anyway.  am i right.  i can understand a son wanting to respect his father.  but sheen's probably already forgotten you said that stuff.    hey, jimmy.  your dad's running in traffic again.  oh, and i brought by some paperwork.  paperwork. yeah.  if my dad's not really a superhero and they toss him in the loony bin, i'd like your parents to adopt me.  sheen, i'm sure your father isn't crazy.  hmm, he could be just a huge liar.  either way, i'm bracing myself for the horrible disappointment.  well, see you at noon.  please, jimmy.  we'd better get started.    may i present retroville's greatest heroel magnfico.  i feel... super.  jimmy: okay, el magnfico, the school bus is teetering on the edge of the cliff.  they need your help.  el magnfico will put an end to their teeter.  jimmy: the gravity gloves are working.  hi, jimmy, mr. estevez.  wow, mr. estevez, you look different.  did you trim your moustache.  i am... el magnfico.  i'm giving sheen's dad a superpowered suit for 24 hours so sheen will respect him more.  uh, carl, would you step to the side.  no, no, the other way.  carl, look out.   well, my new laser elbows appear to function properly.  maybe i should come along tomorrow just to be safe.  carl, i could use your help.     uncover your eyes, carl.  you can't even see where you're going.   now, why was it so important to go to the zoo again.  uh... i thought you should see the zebras, uh, because it's... striping season.  okay, carl...  : we're almost ready for the rendezvous with el magnfico.  suit's at full power.  mr. estevez, are you ready.  i know not this mr. estevez, for i am...  el magnfico.  carl, open the gate.  : right.  ooh, look, sheen, that zebra's getting ready to stripe.  what.  how can you tell.  wait a minute, isn't striping season in the spring.  zebrapede. )
