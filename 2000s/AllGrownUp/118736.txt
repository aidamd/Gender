 i have just been informed that some young lady has taken to rendering some art in the girls' room, and not that i'm pointing any fingers...  but angelica pickles is to report to my office immediately.  me.  oh, you're pickles.  here.  but, sir...  i'm the one who graffitied the girls' room.   susie carmichael, it's very gallant for you to want to take the fall for a friend, but that won't be necessary.    and the ability to separate yolks from whites is a cornerstone in the culinary arts.  we shift the yolk back and forth between the two shells, thusly allowing the egg white to fall into our bowl.  now, i know this is difficult, so i don't expect you to get this right...  away.    impressive, but know what to do with this.  get the yolk.  and it's down.  and then it's over.  pow.   oh...  the hall monitor claims she saw me leaving the bathroom right before the graffiti was discovered.  now i have to scrub the graffiti off the entire bathroom all because of this force field of perfection around you.  this is the worst.  girl: angelica.  love the misdeed.  you've gained some serious street cred, girl.  girl: is it true you have to scrub all the bathroom graffiti.  bathroom.  try the whole school.  ooh. ooh. ooh.  sit with us.  hey, it wasmymisdeed, thereforemystreet cred.  oh, susie, you really are too good to be true.  now, you just give it up, girl.  i wouldn't have done the crime if couldn't do the time.  fine.  you don't believe me.  i'm going to go confess to pangborn.  just watch and see who's scrubbing the graffiti off the walls around here.   but i am telling the truthi did it.        susie, what can i say.  you saved my life.  didn't mean to, it just sort of happened.  but you sure had me going there.  the day susie carmichael goes bad is the day chickens fly.   now, get back to your class before you mess up your perfect attendance record.  you hear.   : oh...  "allaround perfect student." well, look out, people.  there's going to be eggs on the sidewalk, because chickens are going to fly.  kimi: are you sure you want to mess with this perfect thing.  yeahyou've, like... perfected it.  well, i am over it.  i am tired of everyone thinking i'm so perfect.  and i'm going to start with some wicked pranks, like turning all the library books backwards.    mrs. hamfish.  i need to do some research.  mind if i stay an extra hour.  just remember to lock up.  listen to melike i need to tell susie carmichael that.   hey.  what's an "m" doing with all the "a's".  an "s"..  were you people raised in a barn.  dickens, dostoyevsky...   pjiminy.  that sure looks festive.  thanks.  d'oh.  she called me a culinary genius.  can you imagine.  me, a genius.  mrs. cunningham said if i keep working at it, maybe one day i could have my own cooking show.   ugh...  how about calling it "school cafeteria makeover".  all it needs is a little parsley.  ugh, don't tell me.  you're going to use curlyleaf, am i right.  step aside, knave.  it's, like, i'm genetically incapable of being bad.  lil: so. we like you the way you are.  what, on the edge of... boring.  i am so goodygoody, i even ran out of ideas for bad things to do.  you could start a food fight.  but they just repainted it here.  and...  hand me the sandwich.  wait.  it's all about presentation.  okay, now just throw it.  well.  where'd it go.  you threw it, right.  of course i threw it.   it isn't me...  itit's my hand, it won't let go.  creepy.  angelica's right: i do have this force field of perfection around me.  i'll always be reliable, always get good grades, always floss, and always do the right thing.  i'll probably end up president of the united states.  my life stinks.  man: do all your homework.  yes.  how about the extra credit.  yes.  draft that essay about why i'd like to go to space camp this summer.  yes, yes and yes.  did you just mouth off to me.  no, i didn'...  yeah...  yes. yes, i did.  i did mouth off.  there's hope for me yet.   that's right. i'm bad.   phil: see, chuckie, you've been doing it all wrong.  you have to add the fruit while the blender's going so you emulsify the ingredients, see.  you just don't want to throw everything in there and hit "puree"that's amateur hour.  darn, forgot the mango.  you ain't seen nothing till you see me pit a mango.  you got to help me.  he's been here for two hours lecturing me on things like prep and the proper way to peel a banana.  isn't there only one way to peel a banana.  no, tommy, no, there isn't.  i can't take it anymore.  we need to do something about it.  i know he's annoying, but shouldn't we be happy for him.  phil's found something he's really good atfood.  i just never expected it from a guy who just last week filled his bellybutton with peanut butter and called it a meal.  ah, glad you're here, tom.  i was thinking about your mom's fajitas.  her specialtygot to love it.  no, you don't.  walk with me.  angelica: and then pangborn told me if i ever did graffiti again...  he'd suspend you. he'd suspend you.  did i tell you about how his neck hairs stood on end when he yelled at me.  each and every follicle.  face it, angelica, your bad isn't good anymore.   susie, is that you..  what's up, fool.  i just can't believe it.  you look so...  bad.  yes, you look bad, but are you.  susie carmichael.  she wouldn't hurt a fly.   well, judge for yourselves just how bad i am.  sorry, got my vest caught in the copy machine, so i'm going to have to write today's quiz on the board.    marsh: hmm...  how'd this get in here.  angelica: i mean, big deal.  chalk in the eraser.  seen it a million times.  and that one, too.  and did you grease all the toilet seats in the girls' room.  hmm, maybe.  that was you.  i could've used a warning.  gee, angelica, susie's getting to be better at this than you.  all those things are straight out ofbad for morons.  well, here's one that isn't.  you know that old pair of sneakers hanging the top of the abandoned telephone company building.  the ones that those two football players stole from a freshman and stuck up there a long time ago.  only when they were coming down, they fell off.  one of them broke his leg and the other one can't say "thermometer" anymore.  uhhuh.  never heard of them.  no one's gone up there to get them since because they're too afraid.  and you want one of us to go up there get them.  you'd make bad history.  this is insulting.  insulting.  i've spent my whole life lying, cheating and manipulating people.  no, ten lifetimes.  i don't need to prove how bad i am to anyone.  nuhuh.  my rsum is full.  i'll do it.  you're on.  tommy: okay, phil, step away from the whisk.  huh.  we're here to help you, son.  have you guys gone loco.  the step is to admit you have a problem.  i dothese eggs aren't organic.   hey.  oh.  poor thing.  look at yourself, phil.  all you think about these days is food.  the other night at my house, you made my mom cry.  well, frozen peas.  you can't let something like that go.  you know what.  i think you guys are jealous because i've found something i'm really good at and you guys didn't.  in fact, i have been chosen to do a cooking demonstration tonight for the school board.  i was going to invite you guys, but since you think i'm just some bizarro food snob, you can stuff it.   ahh...  wow, he is good.   doesn't look so scary to me.  a walk in the park.  what were we even thinking.  i'm blowing this pop stand.  me, too.  i mean, there is a world of difference between being bad and being stupid.  no one could have said it more perfectly.  see you tomorrow.  yeah... i'll see you.   in a minute.  my base coat's still tacky.  angelica, you got to...  yike.  hey, beauty isn't pretty.  now, if you don't mind, i'm in the middle of a home spa treatment.  but susie's climbing the phone company building.  what.. she said she was going home.  uhuh.  we went by to see how scary the place was and she had already snuck in.  we tried to talk her out of it, but we couldn't.  give me a minute.  you've seen that placewe don't have a minute.  okay, okay.  they won't be back for another hour.  lil: there she is.  it doesn't look sturdy enough to hold all of us.  and i had a big dinner.  fine, i'll go.    angelica: stop.   you got to stop skipping gym class, girl.  look, susie, you said yourself there's a big difference between bad and stupid, and this is stupid.  forget it. i didn't get all the way up here notto get those sneakers.  oh, man.  now i know why those football players fell.  they must have passed out from the smell of those things.  i mean, we are talking ripe.  stop.  listen to me...  if you get those sneakers down, you won't be proving you're bad.  you'll just be doing one more thing absolutely perfectly.  now, do you really want that hanging over your head.  you do have a good point.  i do.  i do.  now, let's go home.    angelica, i don't know if i can hang on.  you don't and i'll never speak to you againliterally.  if we sprint, we can probably catch up with that patrol car.  hang on.  angelica: did you hear that.  we just have to hang on.  and hope these laces hold out.   tommy: you realize this may be the last time we hang out with phil.  and i say this as a journalist: it's real hard being objective.   ladies and gentlemen, tonight i shall be making for you a swiss cheese torte with caramelized onions.  audience: ooh...   all: eww.  what.  what i do.   susie: where are they.  my fingers feel like they're about to fall off.  you just need something to take your mind off the pain.  i knowi'll sing.  you sing and i'll let go for sure.  i just can't believe you got us into this just to prove to brianna you're not perfect.  since when do you care about what she thinks.  that's my pathetic deal.  not her.  i wanted to prove it to myself.  prove what.  that you can break every bone in your body.  you're the one who never caves to peer pressure.  we need girls like you around to make the rest of us look bad.  but people don't realize the kind of sweat that goes into being perfect.  i don't glide through anything, i have to work at it.  you do.  of course i do.  oh.      that was the stupidest, most dangerous, stupidest...  you said that already.  and i'm going to keep saying it, young lady.  you're right.  it was dangerous and stupid, but don't blame angelica.  she just came up to talk some sense into me.  i don't believe it.  this wasyouridea.  do you realize what this will do to your permanent record.  susie, please...  you don't have to cover for me.  i was the one who started this.  now,thati believe.  folks, i need you to sign off on your kids and these rank sneakers.  why did you do that.  do you know what kind of grief you're going to catch.  look, you wanted to prove to yourself you weren't perfect. you did.  no reason you need to mess up everything you've worked so hard for.  thanks.  besides, that kiltwiththejeans lookyou really can't carry it off.  watch it.  i still can't believe they kicked you out of cooking class.  who knew there were things called health regulations.  but you're so good at it.  aw, that's okay, fellas.  i'll find something else.  you know my motto: "never pursue a profession where you got to wash your hands." swiss cheese torte.  uh, no, thanks. rain check.  captioned by media access group at wgbh accesshwpxg/h h hhwxbk(]  (](]   thump. both: whoa.   here we go 'cause we're fanboy and chum chum    a little cuckoo, fanboy and chum
