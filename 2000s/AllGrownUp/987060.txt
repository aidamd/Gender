the group.  but he doesn't annoy me.  i find his humor disturbingly complex.  get that gum out of your hair yet.  no.   hey.  hey.  listen, i'm sorry about zoning out at practice.  i know this game means a lot.  it's okay.  is that doom raider 5..  it just came in today.  yes. we've been waiting three months to play that.  i know.  listen, can i talk to you about something.  i'm listening.  the weirdest thing happened today.  wally and me were sitting in the park...  watching the cloudsher idea.  then it happened.  it was so weird.  i started sweating and my stomach got all queasy.  it felt like riding whiplash gorge three times in a row.  boy, you really didn't like it, did you.  are you kidding.  it was the greatest thing ever.  i cannot wait to do it again.  can we please not talk about this anymore.  oh...  oh, sure, yeahbecause i got to go anyway.  wait.  i thought we were playing doom raider 5.  oh, no, i just brought that in for you.  i'm going over to wally's.  tell me how it is.  : oh, sarah, i'll never have a friend as good as you.  until i take away your brother and leave you with no one to play with.  ow. ouch.  give me back my dress.  i'm going to kick your little classic behind.  hi.  gee, where's phil.  i ditched him.  really.  yeah, i wanted to talk to you about him.  oh...  the other day in the park, i held his hand and he got all pale and started sweating.  i don't think he liked it very much.  did he say anything to you.  well... as a matter of fact, he did mention it to me, and, since we are friends, i'll just say it: he said it made him sick to his stomach.   i'm really sorry, wally.  but you know guys, they're such jerks sometimes.  pickle.  no, thanks.  i'm suddenly not very hungry.    guess what. guess what.  i just heard the pythons' midfielder got chickenpox.  we are sure to win.   don't look at me.  what's wrong.  what's wrong..  everything is wrong.  the world has fallen off its axis.  the sun shall never ine again.  is this about your penalty shots.  because we can work on that.  it's wally.  she dumped me.   oh.  she didn't even say why.  you're her friend, lildid she say anything to you.  no, nothing, nada, zip, zilch, zero, goose eggs, goose eggs.   phil, i have never seen you act like this.  what.  i can't have feelings.  feelings.  you hit yourself on the head with a hammer on a dare.  i got just the thing to cheer you up, mistera game of doom raider 5.  just turn off the light on your way out.  i'm going to lay here and listen to sad songs.  sure.  : wally...  why, why, wally.   you broke wally and phil up.  no...  i just told wally what phil had told me.  he'll get over it.  you know phil, he has a short attention span.  tommy: just come init's one drink.  i can't...  this was our place...  wally and me.  we'll share an orbit smoothie.  : weshared an orbit smoothie.  look, just sit over there.  wesat over there.  oh, man...  i remember the first thing she ever said to me: "move it, loser." tommy, some help here.  hey, have you seen, dil.  nope.  lil, can you do something about your brother.  i think hurricane lil has done enough damage to two lives.  what.  i... sort of was the person who sort of told wally phil didn't like her...  sort of.  why would you do that.  they were annoying.  chuckie: any more annoying than that.   i can't be here.  it cuts too deep.  boy, if my sister did something like that...  i mean, if she told my girlfriend i didn't like her... geesh.  man, i'm sure glad i don't have a sister.  so is she.  you told wally i didn't like her.  i willneverforgive you for this, lillian.  geesh, he's a little testy.  anyone drinking this.  well, if anyone sees dil, tell him i was looking for him.  i'll get rid of him.  pangborn: okay, phil, you'll be right defense with lil.  i don't want to play with her.  she's the one who told wally i didn't like holding her hand when i do.  you tell her about what we do.  i'm his sister.  it was supposed to be a secret, lillian.  okay then, wally, you be over on left defense with lil.  i don't want to play with her.  she lied to me.  okay, phil, you play midfield.  i'll put lil in right field and wally on left.  phil: then i'm between both of them.  lil: i'm not doing iti'll play goalie.  i know there's some personal issues going on in the team, but this is a shot at hawaii, so let's put it aside and focus on the game.  she's right, let's keep our heads in the game, okay.  okay.  hey, gonzalez.  tell my sister, the jerk, i'm open.  wally, i'm clear, i'm clear.  like i'm supposed to believe that.  what is going on out there.  they're not playing together.  i've never been to hawaii.  man, your friends stink.  i'd be embarrassed to be seen with them.  uh, funny you should bring that up.  except for you, tommy and chuckieyou're the coolest guys.  so, what were you saying.  never mind.  but i got to ask you: what's with that hat you wear all the time.  it's a sherpa hat.  yeah, sherpathetic.   it happens to be a himalayan chulu hat.  that's because it chullooks ugly.  : "look at me... i'm dil.  i'm the weird one." that's it.  i've had it with you.  you're selfish, obnoxious, and nobody likes you.  and one more thingnobody... touches... the hat.  i'm... mortyfied.   way to go, lillian.  i called it first.  oh, you just want everything to yourself, don't you.  i'm not the one who blabbed behind her brother's back.  well, i'm not the one who ignored her friend.  hey, i'm the one who got dumped.  i'm in pain here.  you're the one who said he didn't like me, jerk.  creep.  liar.    i guess i jumped the gun on the victory celebration.  tell me you didn't order a clown.  worse.  hey, what's this.  a quarter in your ear.   i can't believe we lost the chance to go to hawaii.  maybe if wally hadn't dumped me, we wouldn't have.  say that one more time and i'm making you sit with the rest of the team.   i'm sorry.  this was all my fault.  i have to admit, i was jealous.  i didn't want to lose my brother.  i can't believe you thought that.  i'll always love you.  wwwhat did you just say.  nothing.  lil: wally.  wait.  look, i don't blame you for being mad at mei did an awful thingbut don't take it out on my brother.  he really does like you.  the thing is, this whole boygirl thing is so confusing.  it just seems to mess everything up.  so that means we can all just be friends again.  totally.  hey, i heard they just repaved nosebleed hill.  let's go get our bikes.  great.  hey, little lady, what's in your ear.  a quarter.  hey, slowpoke, what's keeping you.  are you coming or not.  right behind you.  pangborn: hey, pickles.  i want to talk you about what you said to my nephew.  i don't know what you said...  but you really turned morty around.  all of a sudden he was this polite, considerate, kindhearted child.  i was just honest with him, sir.  whatever you did, when i put him on that bus back to ohio this morning, he was changed man.  thanks.
