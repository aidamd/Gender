not my religion.  in dil pickleism, lying is okay.  of course, no girls are allowedthey have cooties.  guys, can you leave me alone.  i've got six hours of studying to do here.  wait a second.  i thought we were playing mini golf tonight.  sorry, chuckie.  sunday, okay. promise.  chuckie: oh, man, why am i always the one left in the dust when tommy finds a girl.  this time i'm going to get my own girl.  how. all the girls at school already know you.  then i'll meet a whole new crop of girlstommy's way.   phil : i don't know if this is such a good idea, man.  are you kidding.  this place is crawling with girls.   oh, my gosh.  did you see that.  please turn to page 35.  can't we go.  not until i get that girl's name.  now we can go.   tommy: ow.  ow.  tommy, can you bring me over that toolbox.   so, what'd you want.  hand me those shims.  tommy: uh, shims.  shims... first they got me learning hebrew, now this.  thanks.  sorry i came down on you about religious school the other day.  it's just my family thinks it's really important.  mine, too.  they're really into all this cultural stuff.  mine, too.  my dad studied to be a rabbi.  mine, too.  your dad's a rabbi.  uh, well, uh...  we have a lot more in common than i thought.  hey, why don't you come over for dinner friday.  you can lead shabbat.  oopsmy ride's here.  later.   what's shabbat.  dil, what's shabbat.  uhoh, what'd you tell rachel this time.  nothing. she just invited me over for shabbat and... oh, she thinks dad's a rabbi.  a rabbi.  he's not even jewish.  boy, this lying thing is becoming a real disease with you. i didn't lie.  i just didn't correct her assumptions.  if you were practicing dil pickleism, you'd be grounded for eternity.  i thought you said lying was okay in your religion.  well, we had a meeting.  lying is out. girls are in.  hey, dad, do you know what shabbat is.  sure, a male robot.  group :...   om...  this is it, this is the one.  there she goes.  here's my chance.  what's wrong.  i'm...  i'm stuck.  oh, you're a software engineer.  i make video games.  you know super monkey pummel six.  that's mine.  mmm... good tea.  it's for washing your hands.  oh... i knew that.  i like to get my mouth clean, too.  you know what they say, dirtiest part of the body.  tommy, would you like to say the blessing over the challah. challah.  lord, thank you.  oh, thank you for this bread which we are about to eat.  and... abracadabra.  you are now a loaf of bread.  amen.  truth is... i don't speak hebrew.  and your dad's a rabbi.  he's very newschool.  you wouldn't even know he's a rabbi if you met him.  well, it's not important what you say on shabbat as long as in your heart you really feel thankful for what you have.  why don't we go around the table and say what we're thankful for.  i'm thankful for spending time with my family and for... for meeting tommy.  hi, grandpa.  what you doing. shelling peas.  no, i'm shelling peas.  so, from the look of you, i'd say this girl you likeshe likes you.  yep.  well, so did your grandma minka, until one day...  and... you're going to tell me about this, too, aren't you, grandpa.  sit and be quiet.  at first, minka and i were spending all our time together and the plan was working like a charm.  then one day i had to work in the shop alone.   it was yokel the baker, known throughout the town as a very hungry man.  good afternoon.  i would like to order five pounds of your very fine chuck steak, two rib roasts and a pound and a half of flanken, a couple of briskets...  boris: but we had run out of meat, which meant i would have to get it myself.   oh, don't look at me like that.  you're a cow, and i'm a butcher.  you're right, i'm not a butcher.   boris...  minka.  please, let me explain.   boris: to this day, i don't know if they were mad that i wasn't a butcher or that i brought a cow into the shop.  grandpa, i know why you're telling me this, but don't worry.  i got everything under control.  tommy, guess what.  i just got a call from hebrew school.  there's going to be a family picnic sunday.  we're going to get to meet all your friends' parents.  all the other parents.  did somebody say "picnic".  i can barbecue my famous pork loin.  stu, a lot of jewish people don't eat pork.  sorry, didn't mean to be insensitive.  maybe there's something else i can make...  spare ribs.  oh, yeah...  rabbi stu.    look.  what..  kettle corn.  not before lunch, stu.  come on, i want to meet some of tommy's friends.  oh, please don't let rachel show up.  please don't let rachel show up.  dil: is that her.  yes. how'd you know..  she looks like a rachel.  also, you've got her picture as computer wallpaper.  cover for me.  tommy, what are you doing in the bushes.  i was going to jump out and surprise you.  surprise.  where's your family, tommy.  uh, they're not here.  they're in...  tel a.. for a bar mitzvah.  didi: where's tommy.  stu: he went this way.  excuse me.  prickly, scratchow.  mom, dad. i think i left the car door unlocked, and there are shady characters around.  who.  that guy.  that's the cantor.  perfect cover.  can't be too careful, deed.  scratchy, stingingow.  where have you been.  i was saving a robin that fell out of its nest.  i thought i heard you talking to some people.  which people.  those people.  who are they.  no idea.  tommy.  "tommy".  hi, i'm tommy's mother.  i thought you were overseas.  just for the day.  these are your parents.  it is an honor to meet you, rabbi.  "rabbi".  he's not a rabbi.  i'm not even jewish.  huh.  rachel...  rachel...  so why did you say he was a rabbi.  i didn'tyou did.  i just didn't correct you.  oh... what else have you told me that isn't true.  that you like hebrew school.  that you really wanted to work on my project.  why would you do such a thing.  i just wanted you to like me.  i already did.  grandpa, you were righti messed up.  please, i need to hear the rest of the story.  what do i look like, voicemail.  please, i need to know how you won back grandma minka.  okay, okay.  i was sad for many months afterwards.  i didn't talk to anybody and no one talked to me.  boris.  sha.  but, boris...  we are not talking to anyone.  my darling minka is lost to me forever.  that's what i wanted to tell you.  i found minka.  you did..  boris: he told me that minka's family had gone to america.  i knew immediately what i had to do.  i gathered all of my things and walked all the way to the ocean in search of a ship that would take me to america.    i looked all over new york for minka.    a year and half later, still no minka.  then...  boris..  minka..  boris: it was a miracle.  minka was no longer rich, but that night she made me a corned beef sandwich that could knock your socks off.  i've been a meat eater ever since.  five years later, she married me.    tommy: five years.  you came all the way to america and it took five years for her to marry you.  your grandmother has a long memory.  oy, which reminds me, i'd better go buy her an anniversary present.  you know, sometimes admitting you were wrong is the best thing you can do.   i've got a lot of that to do.  not only to rachel, but i forgot all about meeting chuckie.    chuckie. wait.  i'm... i'm sorry.  let me explain.  you don't have to.  it's like i said, you're meeting new people and you don't have time for me.  i get it.  no, you don't.  rachel hates me.  she thinks i'm a big faker, and i am.  my grandpa was right: you can't pretend you're something you're not just to make a girl like you.  tell me about it.  i still got the leg cramps to prove it.  huh.  long story.  you sure she'll never forgive you.  oh, it'd take a miracle.  this iwhere she goes to school.  yeah, but how are we going to find her.  she said she does a lot of afterschool activities.  the trick is finding which one.   hey, is that her.  come on.  wow, she's pretty, smart and plays sports, too.  i wouldn't play with me either.  what are you doing here.  : i was... i was, uh...  he came to say he was a total jerk and he hopes you can forgive him.  yeah, that's it.  although "jerk" is a little harsh.  sorry, i just can't.  let's go.  i'm... kind of surprised to see you here.  yeah, i know.  funny thing is i like doing thishelping people.  i'm even beginning to think hebrew school's cool.  don't get carried away.  i'm sorry i messed up our friendship...  but i'm going to keep working on the house.  feel free to avoid me.   here, hold the nail a little lower, like this.   captioned by media access group at wgbh  pox9xo"8y zxo b8y  every birthday,my mom and dad would say    "you're another year older,another year wiser"    but i still go to
