patrick: i don't get it. what's an audit. spongebob: i don't know. let me check the rules.  playing "certified public accountant" isn't as much fun as i thought.  maybe it'll be funner if we play louder. patrick:  i am rolling the dice.  now i am moving.  "run...spreadsheets". spongebob: what does that even mean..  patrick: well, maybe i'm supposed to run around with this sheet we spread on the ground. spongebob: yeah, that sounds right to me.  spongebob: hey, squidward. wanna play "certified public accountant" with us. squidward: oh, let me think. that sounds so no.  patrick: i don't think this game is ripe. spongebob: yeah, maybe it got picked too soon. squidward:  what. do you think that games grow on trees.  patrick: doesn't everything grow on trees. squidward: no, you ninny. somebody makes them. patrick: makes them. squidward: yeah. somebody thinks up the game, then they make the game. patrick: then i could make a game. squidward: no, you couldn't. you would be incapable. spongebob: well, i think patrick could make up a game. squidward: your operative word there is think. patrick: yeah. the opernive... word is think.  thanks, squidward. i'll do it. spongebob: go get'em, patrick. squidward:  double morons.  patrick: i invented a game. i invented a game. squidward: whoopee. do tell. patrick: well, you know how hard "tictactoe" is and how it always takes so long to play. squidward: uhhuh. patrick: yeah. well, i made it easier and faster. squidward:  i know i'm gonna hate myself for saying this, but what have you got. patrick: it's called...  "tictac". you start with two lines that are crossed. and then the first person puts an x. and then the next person puts an, uh...  squidward: o. patrick: oh, yeah. an o. and the first person to get two in a row draws a line through them and says, "tictac"..  you start.  squidward: tictac. patrick: uh...  best two out of four. french narrator: many tictacs later...  squidward: tic and tac. patrick: i should've gone with my first idea: "tic".  patrick: squidward, i got a new game. it's called "rock, paper, butter".  squidward: butterin' than the different game.   patrick: squidward, i got it.  whose rope is longer. you...  aww. you played this before.  patrick: sandy, i've been trying to invent a game, but every game i invent is a failure. sandy:  if you want to invent a game, you should study all the games you like and figure out what it is you liked best about them.  then you can use those elements in the game you invent.   patrick:  i know what to do.  patrick: and so it begins.  patrick:  it's a game. it's a game. now i know what it's like to be a game maker.  squidward: i don't see the point to this game night. every game that patrick has "invented" is more pointless and boring than the last. sandy: this time, he did research. squidward: well, if it's started, then i'm already bored. sandy: well, i'm excited. we're gonna be the first people to test out patrick's game. spongebob: this is gonna be written about it in the history book someday. squidward: yeah. in crayon.  patrick: good evening. please step into my gamatourium.  squidward: more like a lamatourium. ha.  patrick: welcome, gamers. and behold.  my game.  spongebob: it's beautiful. squidward:  are we finished. who won.  patrick:  no, my friend. we have only just begun. sandy: what's it called, patrick. squidward: might i suggest "garbage".  what. spongebob: yeah, patrick. what's it called.  patrick: it's called... patrick. the game.  spongebob: wow. squidward: could we just get started already. i'm late for my coma.  patrick: alright.  i'll explain the rules. each player picks a piece to move around the board. the way you decide which player gets to pick the piece by rolling the dice.  to decide who gets to roll the dice first to see who gets the first choice of players, you have to be... squidward: look, patrick. you go, then sandy, then spongebob, then me. okay. patrick: you mean for picking our player or for starting the game. squidward:  both. patrick: ok. now, onto rules of how to play the game. squidward: i've got a great idea. why don't we just start rolling and you can explain the game as we play. patrick: hmm...  okay.  oh, money..   sandy: yeehaw. beach broad property.   spongebob: driver's license. driver's license. but what does that mean. patrick: oh, on your next turn, you roll then you can move down the board or you can go round the race track as many times as you rolled. spongebob: oh, what should i do. what should i do. what should i do. squidward: could you give me the dice. give me the dice. because it's my turn.  squidward: uhhuh. patrick: you go to jail.  blue cellmate: what are you in for, pal. patrick: my turn.  one... two...  squidward: oh, good thing you've landed on snacks. you must be famished.  sandy: hmm... coral avenue. i'll buy it.  spongebob: twelve. i'll... drive the car.  patrick: oh, you don't get to roll when you're in jail. squidward: well, what do i do to get out of jail. patrick: you have to roll a six.  patrick: hey. you can't roll the dice when you're in jail. spongebob: yeah, play by the rules. squidward: well, if the only way to get out of jail is to roll a six. and i can't roll if i'm in jail. just how am i supposed to get out of jail.. grrr. patrick:  ah, here it is.  the guy that is in jail has to stay there unless he rolls a six or someone says his name. squidward:  fine. someone say my name.  patrick: oh boy. you landed on "do a surgery".  now, pick a surgery card. sandy:  hmm... remove finbone from player to your left.  squidward: what. wait. no. but i don't have a finbone. i'm an octopus. sandy: hush, now. this won't hurt a bit.  sandy: got it. patrick: now, sit back down, you criminal. squidward: oh, this game doesn't make any sense. spongebob: sounds like someone's mad because he hasn't moved. squidward: well, neither have you.  squidward:  that's it. i've had enough. spongebob: come on, squidward. wait. sandy: don't go, squidward. patrick: no wait, squidward. spongebob: squidward. patrick: wait, how'd he get out of jail. spongebob: squidward made us say his name. sandy: that was a smart move, squidward. squidward: huh. oh. hmm...  spongebob: now you roll after me.  spongebob: five. one, two, three, four, five. um, i think i'll... squidward: race the car. spongebob: i'll... squidward: race the car. spongebob: i'll... race the car.  squidward: oh boy. snacks.  patrick: jail for squidward. squidward: but i was on snacks. patrick: tell it to the judge.  squidward: could someone please tell me what we are supposed to be doing. what's the point. this entire game is completely random. it jumps from one thing to another. i don't know how you are supposed to win. and patrick seems to be making up the rules as he goes along. patrick: starving. starving sea star time.  squidward:  okay, i'm going outside. patrick:  if a person declares outsidies, then everyone must go outside. squidward: but i didn't say "outsidies" i said...  patrick: four. we are in a giggle zone. everyone laugh.  squidward: ha.  spongebob: two.  silly face. silly face.  sandy: now, that's a silly face. spongebob: hey, squidward, you finally understand the rules. squidward: oh, i get the rules alright. the rules are that it doesn't matter what anybody rolls. you can just make up whatever it means.  so, i could just roll the dice and say, "automatic winner." spongebob: good job, squidward. you've won. sandy: nice play, squidward. squidward: huh. oh, you know what, you're right. that was a good play. patrick: not so fast.  no player may declare himself "automatic winner." squidward: you did it again. you made up another rule. this game is the worst. stupid game.  highway speed patrol: destruction to private property.  highway speed patrol: oh, and i see here you are a repeat offender. you're going to real jail.  squidward: anything to get out of this game. thanks, officers. blue cellmate: welcome back. squidward: somebody say my name.  patrick: game over. ) )
