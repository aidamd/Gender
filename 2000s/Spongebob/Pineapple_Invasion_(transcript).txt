plankton: say what. karen: i said good luck.  plankton: that formula will be mine.  plankton:  out of my way, pinheads. move it, move it, move it.  hey there, snazola. i'm about to show you the advantage of not having a nose. say hello to... mr. stinky.  plankton: that's right, everyone. gather in real close.  time to trigger the stench.  yoink.  spongebob: huh.  no, no, no, no, no, no.  spongebob: not the patties. i'll save you.  mr. krabs: what's all the racket out here.  spongebob: mr. krabs, are you alright. what happened. mr. krabs: i don't know. me eyes were burnin'. all i saw was a little eyeball and a pair of antenna and...  plankton.  he's still in there. alone. with me secret formula. he could be doing anything with it.  he could be reading it.  mr. krabs: give me your hand, boyoh.  i need to borrow this.  ok, i'm going in. spongebob: good luck, mr. krabs.  mr. krabs: why you little... plankton: i hope you like percussion, eugene. because these drumsticks really go

spongebob: yes, sir. i see the problem.  mr. krabs: whew. that was too close my lad. three more safes and he would've had me secret formula.  mr. krabs: looks like i'm gonna have to beef up security around here.  mr. krabs: i'm gonna need you to do me a big favor, laddy.  mr. krabs:  take this home with ya and hide it while i reevaluate my security situation.  spongebob: but mr. krabs, how do you know it will be safe from plankton at my house. mr. krabs: pisha. he'll think it's still here. his tiny brain is incapable of the kind of abstract thinking that is required for reflection. or thoughtful reasoning and deduction. he cannot ruminate.  mr. krabs:  he cannot define the hypothesis. he's a tired clown. he'll never know it's in your house. plankton:  oh, you're right, professor krabface. i'm much too simpleminded to look there.   plankton: hey, there.  plankton: pleasant night, eh spongebob. spongebob:  oh, uh, yes. it's a very nightynight for a walkie. plankton: ain't that the truth. hey, nothing gets past you. one could say you have the formula for honesty. spongebob: uh, yeah. one could say that i guess. uh, anyway. i gotta go wash my formula.  hair. hair. i gotta go wash my hair. uh, good night, plankton.  plankton: yeah. gotta keep that hair clean and in a safe place. spongebob:  okay, bye.  french narrator: the next morning... spongebob: now remember, gary. i'm entrusting you with the secret formula. gary: meow. spongebob: stay sharp, gary. don't let anyone inside. gary: meow. spongebob: bye, gary.  gary: meow.  plankton: why, hey there, little fella. is spongebob..  i mean your master at home.  eh, perhaps i could just come inside for a minute and demonstrate our fine snail products.  plankton: shell polish, slime deodorant, chew toys... gary: meow.  plankton: my leg.  plankton: your friends won't tell ya this, but you can really use the slime deodorant, smelly. french narrator: moments later...  gary: meow.  plankton: hello, sir...  hello, sir. i'm selling sweetie patrol cookies. we have a lovely assortment of fungi and algae flavors.  plankton: how many delicious boxes can i put you down for. if you order ten boxes, i'll qualify for my bottomdweller badge. if you order a hundred boxes, i'll get my blingbling badge. you know, you should hide these from your roommate. she'll eat all of them.  if you show me your best hiding place, i'd be happy to help.  gary: meow, meow.  plankton:  note to self: nitroglycerin is not a substitute for vanilla extract.  french narrator: more moments later...  gary: meow.  plankton: i forgot how much i hate pineapple.  plankton:  hey, this snail litter tastes better than pineapple.  now, where is that secret formula.  plankton: where is it. where is it. gotta be here somewhere.  plankton: nothin' in there.  ooh, look at that.  plankton: hello.  plankton: where the barnacles is it.  plankton: where is it. where is it. i know you're in here. you're not foolin' anybody. i went to college.  plankton: nope, nope, nope.     plankton: alright, snail. let's go. just you and me. gary: meow. plankton: put 'em up. put 'em up.  plankton: of course. what a fool i've been.  plankton: spongebob's hidden the secret formula inside gary's shell. sheesh. this place is disgusting. i bet it reeks. good thing i don't have a nose. huh.  aye yae yae.  spongebob: gary, i'm home.  spongebob: what happened here.  my first krabby patty. i had it bronzed. oh, and i was gonna give that to my grandchildren.  my mermaid man collectible underpants. oh, i could've worn them a thousand more times.  my glass of water.  i was gonna drink that. oh, the krabby patty formula.  spongebob: whew. it's safe and right where i left it.  spongebob: gary, did you do this. gary:  spongebob: what's the matter, gary. something wrong with your shell. gary: meow, meow. spongebob: something's not right, gary.  spongebob: i'd better get you to the vet. gary: meow.  plankton: ha. i lost him. now, i'm lost.  plankton: ah, my head. oh, i must be in the center of the shell.  what's that.  this is it. just like i thought. it was hidden here all the time. the secret krabby patty formula. it's beautiful.  plankton: the heavenly light. i always knew i'd see it once i've gotten the formula. let me bask in its glory.   doctor: well, that's odd. who's that. spongebob: hey, it's plankton. doctor: what's he got there. spongebob: looks like one of my old grocery lists. doctor: i don't know how he got in there, but the gases inside this shell are making the little guy hallucinate. he would've smelled the gases if he had a nose like most goodhearted people.  plankton: ha, ha. i got it. i got it.  plankton: i've finally got the formula. it's mine, it's mine, it's mine, it's mine. open the sparkling apple juice, karen. daddy's bringing the bacon home. hoohoohoohoo. whoo. ) )
