plankton:  i surrender. mr. krabs: eh. i wonder what form of trickery is up that miniature cyclops' sleeve this time.  alright, plankton, i don't know what you're trying to pull on me, but i'll tell ya right now, it ain't going to work. plankton: there's no pulling, krabs. can't you see my peace offering. mr. krabs: what is this.  haha. very funny, plankton. but you're gonna have to do a lot better than taking a stab at my illiteracy to offend me. plankton: don't you get it, krabs. i give up. i'm through competing with you. mr. krabs: but what about all those fevered attempts at trying to steal my krabby patty recipe. plankton: exactly. they've all been just attempts. and every single one a miserable failure. i can feel my arteries clogging up with anxiety just thinking about it.  let me show you something.  look at this place. mr. krabs:  criminy, plankton, you ever heard of spring cleaning. plankton: what's the point. do you know when the last time i had a customer was. mr. krabs: actually, i don't recall you ever having a customer. plankton: well, there he is.  that's why i've decided to quit the restaurant business altogether, and turn the chum bucket into...  this. mr. krabs: you want to turn your restaurant into a pile of junk. plankton: no. these are knickknacks for the new gift shop i'm opening up. mr. krabs:  come on, this has got to be a joke, right. plankton: i'm serious, krabs. soon the chum bucket will be a nice little store for bricabrac and bubblegum. mr. krabs: all right, plankton. but be aware, i'm not letting my guard down. plankton: guard away, my exenemy. i'll just be here starting my new competitionfree career.  spongebob: what's going on mr. krabs. mr. krabs: plankton's concocting another hairbrained scheme to steal me recipe. so keep your eyes peeled. spongebob: whatever you say, cap'n.  mr. krabs: now that's an employee who follows orders.  what in blazes is that noise.  plankton: ah, would you look at that. i have a feeling i'm going to like this new life of novelty items. mr. krabs: uhhuh. clever, plankton. two can play at this game. spongebob:  mr. krabs, look at this cool knickknack i got at the chumporium. mr. krabs:  hmm, i know there's a microphone or camera in here somewhere.  spongebob: uhh, mr krabs, i really don't think there's anything weird in there. mr. krabs: eh, we'll see about that.  i'll just put this in here for safekeeping. you here that, plankton.. join your other friends from the past.  now nobody's getting to see anything. don't you understand this is all part of his ruse. it's just cosmetic. he thinks he can take us out. but we'll show him. we're gonna outfake the faker. well, it looks like old plankton is really going through with it. i guess we don't have to worry about him anymore. yup, we sure whipped him this time. okay, boys, the coast is clear. plankton's turned over a new leaf. spongebob: that's some good news, mr. krabs. mr. krabs: it sure is, you little halfwit. and you know what else is good news. we can finally use that dj system. hit it, spongebob. spongebob: right away, sir. mr. krabs: let's party.   ow. i won. it's time to boogie. yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. squidward: this is idiotic. mr. krabs: dance or you're fired. squidward: you got it, mr. krabs.  mr. krabs:  how do you like them apples, you little...  plankton:  come on, buddy, let's get some shut eye. we have a big day ahead of us at the chumporium gift shop. mr. krabs: wait a minute.  what the....  store shelves. novelty toys. lava lamps.  useless knickknacks. very convincing. but i'm still not buying it. you want a battle, plankton. i'm gonna give you a war.  plankton: ah. a clean snow globe is a happy snow globe.  mr. krabs: plankton. you may have fooled everyone else, you might have even fooled yourself, but you ain't fooling me. plankton: oh, i get it. you caught me redhanded.  those were the days, huh eugene. mr. krabs: grr... plankton: but i found there more to life than just trying to steal your formula. and i found it all right here in novelty items. mr. krabs: bubkes. plankton: ah, eugene. stuck in your old ways. mr. krabs: bubkes. if there's one thing certain in this world, it's that you can't resist me formula.  you know you want it. plankton: thanks, but no. mr. krabs: aha, i knew it.  it was all a trick to get me to hand over... wait, did you say no. plankton: well, if you don't believe me, that's your problem not mine. mr. krabs: problem.. i don't have a problem. you're the one with the problem. look at this. it means nothing. it's all a facade, a hoax, a con, a front...  ...a sham, a snow job...  ...bologna with a side of flimflam and an order of jive. see.. who's the one with the problem.. plankton: look what you've done. this is my livelihood. mr. krabs: sure it is. and this isn't the formula that you don't want. come on, eh. eh. oop. too slow.  plankton:  get out.. mr. krabs:  oh, i get it. stick to your guns, and eventually we'll all believe it. soften us up and when our backs are turned, you'll make your move.  oops. plankton: what's this.  hey, krabs. mr. krabs: i knew you'd come back. plankton: you forgot something.  can't you understand i've wasted so much time chasing after you. and now i have something that's mine. and it makes me happy.  mr. krabs: i never thought i'd see the day. what happened to the invertebrate i used to know. plankton.  plankton: coming, coming.  yo. mr. krabs: uh, plankton. plankton: eugene. mr. krabs: uh, hey. plankton: hey. mr. krabs: listen, uh, i just wanted to...you know...apologize for my behavior today. wasn't right what i done. and i realized i hurt the feelings of, uh, someone i care about. you still there. plankton: yes. i'm still here. mr. krabs: heh, good. uh...i want to make it up to you. what do you say we grab a soda. plankton: sure.  mr. krabs: glad you could make it, buddy. plankton: so, what's this about, krabs.  mr. krabs: i figured since we're no longer archenemies, maybe, maybe we can start over. plankton: yes. yes, i would like that very much.  i guess i won.  mr. krabs: uh, i don't know about this, plankton. plankton: oh, come on. just fall back. trust me, i'll catch you.  mr. krabs: that was truly amazing, plank, old buddy. i guess i really can trust you 100%. plankton: thanks, eugene. that means a lot to me. mr. krabs: and just to prove it to you, i want you to have something. plankton: oh, no, no, come on now. no gifts. mr. krabs: no, no. i want you to have this. it's the secret formula. plankton: i can't believe you would even think... mr. krabs: things are different now. honestly. it would mean a lot to me. plankton: you...you're serious. eugene, if i take this formula from you now, there will always be a hint of doubt. mr. krabs: come on, take it. plankton: you sure.  life is good, krabs. mr. krabs: sure is buddy. sure is.  plankton: yeah, baby. this is it. yeah. whoo.  i got it. i got it. my diabolical, extremely convoluted plan worked. i should've been a politician.  mr. krabs: i never gave you the formula. i fooled you with an even more convoluted charade.  ) )
