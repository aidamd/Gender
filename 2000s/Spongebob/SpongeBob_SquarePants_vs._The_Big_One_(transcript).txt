sandy: aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhh.  mr. krabs: yaaaaaaaaaaaaaah.  wha. where'd the beach go. these waters are calm. too calm.  dark sky.  water spouts.... of blood.  jelly donuts falling from the sky. what could this mean. there's only one logical answer. i've landed right in the middle of dutchman's triangle. right above davy jones' locker. in the devil's galley.  awesome eddie: guys, look. spongebob:  squidward: spongebob, what are you doing with that seaweed. spongebob: just dragging it around. twitch: hey there, homedads. spongebob: huh. twitch: welcome to our remote island. spongebob: island. squidward: island.  twitch: that's right, kemosabay. island. although, we sometimes refer to it as an... island. spongebob: we were just at goo lagoon selling krabby patties when this big wave hit us. now we're on an island. twitch: the ocean works in mysterious ways. awesome eddie: and waves. twitch: mysterious waves. island wanderers:  om.  patrick:  om. spongebob: how did you guys get here. twitch: oh, we've been here since we dropped out of junior college. this is awesome eddie, big g... chip: hi. twitch: chip, and silent stan.  twitch: and i'm twitch. spongebob: why do they call you twitch. twitch:  what. spongebob: never mind.  spongebob: so what did you say this house is made from again. twitch: guano. squidward: great. spongebob: well, it's been fun hanging out with you guys, but mr. krabs didn't give us the day off. so we gotta get back to goo lagoon. twitch: yo, you're miles from the tourist track now, dude. awesome eddie: yeah. the only way back is to surf there. spongebob:  oonly way.... back... surfing.... bikini bottom. aaaaaaahhhhhhhh...  i don't know how to surf...  awesome eddie: whoa, chill out, little dude. we can teach you. spongebob:  cool.  narrator: ah, learning how to surf. to some it comes as easily as eating an ice cream cone on a hot day.  narrator: others...  narrator: ... well... to them, it's like eating an ice cream cone... on a cold day. sometimes, in surfing, it's the approach that's most important. spongebob and patrick:  narrator: and sometimes, it's the retreat.  narrator: once in a lifetime, that perfect wave comes along. not too big, not too small, and the surfer has to act fast... twitch: go. narrator: ... or he stands to miss the ride of his life. spongebob: hey, patrick. wanna see something cool. patrick: you bet. spongebob: down here.  see. it's a picture of squidward. patrick: wow. narrator: but all in all, in life, it's not whether we win or lose, but whether we get totally stoked. spongebob and patrick:  twitch: well, dudes, i give up. awesome eddie: what. twitch: these hodads are impossible to teach.  especially the one on the end over there.  awesome eddie: what's that.  awesome eddie: oh, no. there's no way, dude. he'd never do it.  spongebob: what's he saying. twitch: he reminded us that there is one dude who could possibly teach you. if you can find him. spongebob: who. twitch: his name  is jack kahuna laguna. or jkl, for short. awesome eddie and chip: amen.  twitch: we say that legend says that jkl was last seen upriver at the kahmamoku cove, where every wave is perfect. patrick: will there be nachos there.  spongebob: thanks again for letting us borrow these surfboards, twitch. twitch:  no problem. and just keep following the river straight up until you hit kahmamoku cove. can't miss it. spongebob: how far up stream did you say it was. twitch: well, we don't know cause we've never ever been there. awesome eddie: we're definitely afraid of this river and wouldn't even set foot in it if you paid us. twitch: yeah, interpret that any way you want.  sandy: oh, where am i. where is everybody. i'm stranded. spongebob, where are you...  .i'll make a beeline for the treeline. getting back to nature always does me good. i'll make a beeline for the treeline, i just can't wait to get back in the woods. and if i need to close my eyes and dream, of some quite mountain or stream, that's when i make the beeline for the treeline.. spongebob: could you pull over here. i gotta tie my shoe. squidward: again.. spongebob:  welcome to kahmamoku cove. jkl. guys. guys.. i found the cove..  squidward: i bet this guy won't even be here. if he's anything like that last group of dirty dropouts. spongebob: oh, don't worry, squidward. he'll be here. squidward: you've never even seen him. spongebob: you've got to stop judging people by the way they look.  squidward:  you're right. patrick:  look.  spongebob: it's him. squidward:  oh, my j spongebob: it's jkl. hail o great swami of the gnarly pounders. we seek audience with thee. patrick: plus, we wanna talk to you. spongebob: will you teach us how to surf, o great one, so we may get back home.  patrick: uh... squidward: look, surfboy, are you gonna teach us how to surf, or are we just gonna stand here and stare at you all day. patrick: i kinda like staring at him.  spongebob: i've never seen anything more beautiful. have you, patrick. patrick: not since i saw my first triplelayer cheese cake. jkl: that... was your first lesson.  squidward: what. you call that a lesson. we just stood here and watched you surf for two and a half hours. jkl:  just keep breathing.  mr. krabs: locust. culinary. oh.  look, cashy.  earrings. well, cashy, i guess the devil's galley isn't so bad. as long as that flying dutchman doesnt appear and stick us in davy jones' locker. but that won't happen, will it cashy.  flying dutchman: ow. mr. krabs: arrrgh. it's the flying dutchman. dutchman:  aaahhh. it's some guy i've never seen before. argh. who be disturbing the flying dutchman's walk home from the communion store. you even spilled me milk. mr. krabs: well, there ain't no use crying over it.  yah. don't worry, cashy. ill protect ye.  spongebob: isn't jack kahuna laguna the most totally awesome surf guru you've ever met, squidward. squidward: i don't know about you two, but i'd like to get out of here at some point, and if his idea of teaching us is...  squidward:  oh, wonderful. spongebob: quiet, squidward. i think we're about to receive another lesson. jkl:  just... keep breathing.  squidward: that's it.. i just wanna go home.  spongebob: would it make you feel better if i went and talked to him. squidward: oh, thank you. thank you, spongebob.  well, did you talk to him. spongebob: yup. squidward: and. spongebob: he said we just have to stare into this fire all night, and the secrets will be revealed. squidward: we're gonna be stuck here forever..  sandy: well, sandy, using only your bare hands and the resources found on this deserted island, you have not only survived, but thrived. you've built a five star hotel, a steampowered generator, a car that runs on coconut milk, and even a espresso bar. i almost don't wanna leave. but i miss bikini bottom. now i can find spongebob and the gang and fly us right back.  acorn 1 to tower. request clearance. dennis: roger, acorn 1. you are clear for takeoff.  mr. krabs: oh, please, mr. dutchman. i didn't mean to spill your groceries. flying dutchman: well, normally, i wouldn't mind, but i'm a little low on cash this month, so i have no way to pay for more. unless you have some money i can borrow. mr. krabs: no, i...  cashy. please. cashy is the closest thing to a friend i've ever had.  squidward: oh, oh. please tell me you two didn't stare into that fire all night. spongebob and patrick:  okay... squidward: all right, i'm done. hey, blondey. teach me how to surf so i can go home, or i'm gonna... jkl: you obviously didn't stare into the fire all night like your friends over there.  jkl: those dudes are gonna make awesome surfers.  spongebob: where's he going.. come on.  spongebob:  aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.. patrick: look. he's on top of that big... drinking fountain.  spongebob: jkl. is this the next part of our training. jkl:  uh... spongebob, patrick, and squidward:  jkl: these clouds. they can only mean one thing. patrick: increased chance of precipitation.  jkl: yes. every thousand years or so, the planets align in such a way that a perfect wave is formed. spongebob: a perfect wave. jkl: the world's biggest, fastest, longest, gnarliest, most totally awesome, perfect wave. they call it.... the big one. patrick: hey, that's what they used to call me. jkl: it's probably the only wave big enough for you to ride all the way back to bikini bottom. and you'll have to catch it, or you'll be stuck here... forever.  the big one is almost upon us.  mr. krabs: please. please, mr. dutchman. let cashy go. i promise i'll never soil your waters again. flying dutchman: ya promise. mr. krabs: oh, yes. i promise on my dear aunt sally's false teeth. flying dutchman:  liar...  mr. krabs: what. flying dutchman: your aunt sally doesn't wear false teeth. mr. krabs: how do you know. flying dutchman: because i dated her in high school. mr. krabs:  no..  flying dutchman: whoops.  sandy: this weather sure is dangerous. i better be careful.  may day. may day. i'm goin' down.. repeat: down... flying dutchman: and now, just to make sure this never happens again, i'm gonna send you on a little trip down the ooh ow, ooh ow. ooh. ooh. mr. krabs: uh... where is that, exactly.  sandy:  may day. mr. krabs:  oh, all alone again.  cashy. flying dutchman:  oh, what the... a gym sock. but that means... davy jones: yeah, that's right, baby. welcome... to my locker. ha ha ha ha ha ha....for a daydream believer and a homecoming queen..  the scene cuts to kahmamoku cove] jkl: get ready, dudes. it's coming. spongebob: jkl, thanks for teaching us how to surf. jkl: little dude, i didn't teach you anything you didn't already know. squidward: here it comes.. spongebob: well, jkl, i guess this is goodbye. jkl: wait. there's something i forgot to tell you. in return for its awesomeness, the big one always demands a sacrifice. one of you... will not return. squidward: i volunteer spongebob.  spongebob: keep paddling, patrick. patrick: this wind feels like broken glass mixed with razor blades. spongebob: it's... the big one.... big one: ha ha ha

krabs: and cashy.  cashy..  spongebob: jkl.  spongebob: no.... jkl: little dude,... i was born to do this.  big one:  squidward: i guess the big one prefers a highprotein meal. patrick: now what are
