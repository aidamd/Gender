spongebob: see anything yet, patrick. patrick: i need my glasses.  hmmm...  ...it's the mail truck. spongebob and patrick: our package.  squidward: i didn't realize it was happy hopping moron day. mailman: spongebob squarepants. spongebob: that's me.  squidward: that's a big box. spongebob: thank you.  patrick: hey, spongebob, when do we stop hopping. spongebob: 30 more seconds, patrick.  squidward: they probably ordered a lifetime supply of bubble soap.  huh. a brandnew television. spongebob: easy... easy...  spongebob and patrick: yeah.  squidward: just when i thought they couldn't get any stupider.  let me get this straight, you two ordered a giant screen television just so you could play in the box. spongebob:  pretty smart, huh. patrick:  i thought it wouldn't work. squidward: uhhuh, that's quite a plan there. oh, but wait, there was something else i wanted to ask you two. now what was it. oh, yeah, yeah.  don't you two have any brains.. spongebob: squidward, we don't need a television. not as long as we have our...  ...imagination. squidward: wow, i never thought of it that way. that's really something. can i have your tv. spongebob: with...  ...imagination, i can be anything i want. a pirate.  arrrrr. a football player.  hup. patrick: a starfish. squidward: patrick, you're already a starfish. patrick: see, squidward. it works. you try. squidward:  okay, let's see. i'm imaging myself watching tv...  ...and there it is. can i have it, spongebob. spongebob: sure, squidward. squidward: oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.  spongebob: okay, squidward, but if you change your mind, we'll be in this box. patrick: let's play mountain climbing adventure. spongebob: let's go for it.  gloves. patrick: check. spongebob: hats. patrick: check. spongebob: underwear. patrick: uh... check. spongebob: okay, patrick, climb up there and secure this rope. patrick: you got it.  spongebob: patrick. patrick. patrick, you're going too high. squidward: i hope they put some air holes in that box.  spongebob: take it easy, patrick, you've got to acclimate. patrick: i'll take it easy when i'm dead. i'm shaking hands with neptune. whoo. excelsior. squidward:  now where's that remote.  patrick: i am the lizard king. whoo. spongebob: patrick. patrick. patrick. i think we should keep our voices down. we might start an avalanche. patrick: what. spongebob: i said, i think we should keep our voices down in case of avalanches. patrick: what should we keep down. squidward: morons. spongebob: our voices. squidward: will you two shut up..  sponge... bob.  patrick: hold me. spongebob: hang in there buddy, the chopper's on the way. patrick: spongebob. my legs are frozen solid. you're going to have to cut them off with a saw.  spongebob: no, patrick, i can't do that. patrick: why not. spongebob: because i already cut off my own arms.  patrick: nooooo.  squidward:  what the. how were you two making that noise. spongebob:  what noise, squidward. patrick: i could only hear the sound of our laughter. squidward: yes. but those sound effects: the avalanche, the, the, the... patrick: don't forget the second avalanche. squidward: forget it.  i don't know why i'm wasting my time out here when i could be watching my brand new television.  pilot inside box: attention climbers, please hold on. the saws are on the way. spongebob and patrick: yay. squidward: grrrr... aha.  how are you two doing that. spongebob: first we establish a base camp at 15,000 feet... squidward: the noises. how are you two making those noises. patrick: that's easy. all you need is a box. spongebob: and...  ...imagination. squidward:  are you trying to say that i have no imagination. i have more imagination...  ...in one tentacle than you two have in your whole bodies. patrick: that's good. now all you need is a box.  squidward:  i'll show them.  there's got to be one in here.  ah. this hat box should do nicely.  why haven't i worn this yet.  policeman inside spongebob and patrick's box: attention. we have you surrounded. come out with your hands up. squidward: what do they want with me. what did i do.  obviously, i've violated some new box kicking law.  look officers, everything's okay. i won't do it again. criminal inside box: you'll never take me alive, coppers. man inside box: no, johnny. don't do it.  patrick:  whoopee. another box.  squidward: i got to try to relax. perhaps i can drown out their childish games with a little tv.  male tv narrator: it is here that the boxes reach their final stage of assembly.  professor: the equation is illustrated here by this box.  man: i couldn't afford a present this year, so i got you this box.  woman: that's what i got you.  squidward:  isn't there anything on that isn't about boxes..  announcer: and welcome back to championship boxing. squidward:  hehheh, i guess this is okay. i mean, it's not really about boxes.  i give up. astronaut inside spongebob and patrick's box: 3... 2... 1... blast off.  squidward:  how are they doing that. that was the most realistic space launch i ever heard. there must be an explanation. think, squidward, think.  spongebob: squidward's such a jerk.  squidward: laugh at me, will they.  all right, where is it. patrick:  here i am. spongebob: where's what, squidward. squidward: don't "where's what, squidward." me. where's the tape recorder. spongebob: we don't have a tape recorder, squidward. squidward: don't "we don't have a tape recorder, squidward." me. spongebob: but we don't. patrick:  we have a tape recorder box. squidward:  all right, make way you two, i'm coming in.  spongebob: welcome aboard, squidward. you've just set sail on the s.s...  ...imagination... where our only destination is fantastic adventure. where do you want to go first. squidward: no, no. don't mind me, i'm just here to observe. spongebob: squidward, don't you see. waiting and watching. that's not what the box is all about. it's about...  ...imagination. squidward: all right, fine.  take me to robot pirate island. i wanna armwrestle with cowboys on the moon. just do it so i can get back and watch tv. spongebob: okay, squidward. robot pirate island it is.  patrick:  beepbeepbeep. spongebob:  arr. patrick: beepboopbeeboop. spongebob: ahoy matey. patrick: beepbeep. spongebob: for that you'll walk the plank.  squidward:  why won't this thing turn on..  all right, fine. if you don't want to show me,  i don't care. i've got better things to do than pace the floor wondering how you two work this thing.  how do those two work that thing. there's got to be a secret button or a switch or something. i mean, listen to that.  now, that sounds like robot pirate island. think, squidward, think. i got it: when those two go to bed, i'll sneak in there and find that button. i'll wait all night if i have to.   i need sleep to refuel my imagination tanks. spongebob:  i still can't believe those pirates beat all those robots. patrick: yeah, see you in the morning. spongebob: good night, patrick.   squidward:  hello, what's this.  "this plaque is to commemorate the brave pirates who gave their lives to keep this box safe from the robot menace. lest we forget... ohh.  i've got to find that button quick.  it's got to be around here somewhere. i don't see anything. it's just an empty box. maybe it really was their imagination. oh... get it together, squidward. what are you saying. i mean, do i really believe that if i sit here and pretend to drive a race car that i'm suddenly going to start hearing noises.  what the....  it actually works. i can't believe it. haha. oh boy. this beats tv by a long shot.  whooohoohoo. this is the most fun i've ever had.  spongebob:  listen to that, gary. squidward finally made the box work after all. that's so great. squidward:  vroom. vroom. only two more laps to the finish line.  i'm in the lead. out of my way. i'm almost there.  whoohoohoo. victory is mine.  spongebob: hey, our box is gone. patrick: oh, well. spongebob: i know. let's go see squidward. patrick: i hope he's not too down in the dumps today.  ) )
