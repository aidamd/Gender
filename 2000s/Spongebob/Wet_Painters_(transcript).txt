narrator: a slow day at the krusty krab. spongebob: hey, squidward, check this out.  two ordinary krabby patties, but when expertly tossed with the skill of a champ, they become...  patrick: a oneway ticket to pain.  mr. krabs: huh.  spongebob: heaveho.  mr.krabs: what the devil fish is going on out here.. time is money. and if you boys is wasting time, then you're wasting money.  and that's just sick. spongebob: but we were performing a ritual to attract customers. and the only way the ritual can work is for us to get hurt. real bad. mr. krabs: what stupid barnacle told you that. squidward: uhh  mr. krabs: listen, instead of killing yourselves, i've got something real important for you to do for me.  now, are you men ready for your super.... spongebob and patrick: super. mr. krabs: special.... both: special. mr. krabs:  secret.... both:  secret. mr. krabs: assignment. both:  assignment... i beg of you, mr. krabs.  mr. krabs: the two of you are to paint the inside of me house.  both: yeah.  mr. krabs: but, let me give you two a warning. this here paint is absolutely permanent.  it will never come off. so if i see even one drop on anything but wall, i'll have your rear ends cut off...  and mounted over me fireplace. so, have fun with the job.  spongebob: patrick. patrick: yeah, spongebob.  spongebob: mr. krabs sure has a lot of expensive treasures to drip paint on. do you think we should take this stuff off the walls. patrick: no way, spongebob, we're not getting paid to move stuff. spongebob: patrick, we're not getting paid at all. patrick: well that's what i said. we're not getting paid and that's final. spongebob: ok, we'll just paint around all this stuff. patrick: good, just don't pay me. spongebob: first we need to set up the tarp. patrick: tarp ahoy.  spongebob: we're gonna need more coverage, patrick.  now that's what i'm talking about. well, i guess we should open these cans of permanent paint now. patrick: that will never ever come off. spongebob: and if we get it on anything, mr. krabs will cut our butts off. patrick: and mount them on the wall.  careful, spongebob. careful, spongebob. spongebob, careful. careful, spongebob. careful, spongebob. careful, spongebob.  careful, spongebob. spongebob: patrick, the lid's already off. patrick: oh. now it's my turn.  spongebob: i'm thinking i should do this one too, patrick.  both:  patrick: well that was a ripoff.  spongebob: ok, patrick, let's get our brushes ready.  uhh, maybe we should start with a smaller brush.  all right, patrick, gotta get started painting this wall. with the permanent paint that we're not allowed to get on anything but the wall. well, here we go. narrator: one hour later... spongebob:  just a few more seconds of mental preparation and i'll be painting this wall. narrator: two hours later... spongebob:  i'm getting to the painting. narrator: three hours later...  patrick:  can you move it along, i'm all out of time cards. spongebob: no problem. here i go.  yeah. huh.  barnacles. what could be worse than a giant paint bubble.. patrick: oh, i know.  two giant paint bubbles. spongebob: noooooo.  patrick. patrick: yeah, spongebob. spongebob: i don't think this bubble can get much bigger. patrick:  nonsense. spongebob:  pat, no.  we did it. we painted the whole house and without getting a drop of paint on anything but the  flappin' flotsam. what's that..  we're dead, patrick. do you know what that is. patrick: hmm... it's a dollar. i win. spongebob: that's not just a dollar. it's mr. krabs' first dollar. his most prized possession. and we got paint on it. patrick: i think you are overreacting spongebob, i don't see any paint. spongebob: ok, this isn't a problem. maybe i can just wipe it off.  there. i think i got it.  patrick: oh, now i see it. spongebob: this is not good, patrick. this is not good. mr. krabs is gonna be home soon, and when he sees what we did to his first dollar  both:  patrick: wait, spongebob, all we got to do is wash the paint off and krabs will never know. spongebob: but mr. krabs said patrick: forget what mr. krabs said. every paint comes off with something.  spongebob: did it work.  patrick: nope.  spongebob: did it work.  patrick: nope. patrick:  spongebob: did it work.  patrick: nope.  patrick:  oof. oof. oof. spongebob: nothing's working. patrick: wait, spongebob. we're not cavemen.  we have technology.  spongebob: it didn't work. patrick:  this is all mr. krabs' fault. if he hadn't hung that stupid dollar in the first place....i mean, it's not like it looks any different than a regular dollar. why hang it. you could just stick any old dollar bill on the wall, no one would even know the difference. you might as well reach in my wallet, pull out a dollar, and put it on the wall. and it would... spongebob: hurry, patrick, take out your wallet. patrick:  i don't see where you're going with this...hey, a dollar. spongebob: our butts are saved, patrick. now all we have to...patrick, no.  nowhy'd you put it in the...  grab it, pat, grab it. hurry, hurry.  aww, pat, no, no.  get it, pat, get it, get it, get it.  oh, nohooh. patrick: wanna bite.  spongebob: ok, ok, we still have time.  don't panic spongebob, panic is the enemy. you are strong. through your strength, you shall overcome.  spongebob's reflection: you're on your own pal.  spongebob:  hurry patrick, put mr. krabs' dollar back on the wall. i got an idea.  mr. krabs: what the. spongebob:  we're all done, sir. everything looks great. patrick: yeah, you don't have to look around. we already did that for you.  mr. krabs: you both look like you got a dirty little secret. ha. i'm kidding. let's see how you did. oh, not bad boys, not bad. a nice even coat, high gloss, no bubbles. spongebob: yeah, looks great, mr. krabs. we'll just be going mr. krabs: flippin' fish fossils. look what you did. spongebob:  oh, mr. krabs, we're so sorry. don't debutt me. don't debutt me. patrick:  mr. krabs, i'm sorry. have mercy. have mercy. mr. krabs: sorry. you dusted all my knickknacks. that was really nice. great barrier reef. what's this. spongebob:  it's not our fault, mr krabs. patrick:  we didn't do it on purpose. both:  accident. accident. accident. accident. patrick:  i don't want to be buttless. mr. krabs: oh, and i suppose the floor molding just painted itself on its own.  that's what i call craftsmanship. criminy jimjam. you messed up my dollar...  ...rama.  all the dolls in this dollarama were perfectly aligned.  doll: mama. mr. krabs: and you boys thought i wouldn't notice. oh well, i guess no harm done. all right boys, you're free to go.  ow. that's funny, i don't remember a stack of painting jutting from the wall where me first dollar used to be. in fact, i don't remember this painting at all.  or this one.  or this one.  or this one.  or this one.  or this one.  or this one.  spongebob: hi, mr. krabs. mr. krabs: spongebob, what are you doing. spongebob: oh, you know, just hanging around. patrick: boo. mr. krabs: get down onto the floor, boy.  alright, now you're just being silly.  spongebob: no, mr krabs. no. don't look, it's a trick. mr. krabs:  did you two get paint all over me first dollar. spongebob: we're sorry, mr. krabs. patrick: we're so sorry. mr. krabs: and then did you draw on it with crayon...  patrick:  i thought, you know, maybe he'd buy it. mr. krabs: all right boys, you know what i've got to do now. spongebob: you mean our butts. patrick: can i use mine one last time.  mr. krabs: there we go, good as new. both:  but, but, but, but. but, but. but, but... mr. krabs: yeah, i lied. this paint actually comes off with saliva.  spongebob: oh, i get it, mr. krabs. you told us the paint was permanent so me and patrick would be more careful and not get paint on anything. mr. krabs: nah, i just like to mess with ya.  the old man's still got it.  aww, crud, i really gotta learn to say it, not spray it. ) )
