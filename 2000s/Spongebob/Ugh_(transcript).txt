narrator: it's time for another spongebob squarepants special. but it's not an ordinary special,  because today we go to encino, california, as it was  one hundred million years ago. so prepare yourself for  spongebob squarepants b.c.. before comedy, with your host, patchy the pirate.  patchy: yeeha. hey kids. now, you're probably wondering, "hmm, what's patchy doing in a cave." good question, you little  well, it's because today's spongebob takes place in prehistoric times  back when man struggled for survival  and dinosaurs ruled the earth.  isn't that right, bronty. but i'm riding you now.  it's stuck.  like i was saying, prehistoric times were the greatest.  it was a simpler time  with simpler pleasures.  your clothes always match.  you can draw on the walls. and nobody yell at ya.  it was much easier to hit a baseball.  oh yeah, prehistoric times were the best.  hey kids. are those pterodactyl wings i hear 'a flappin'. i think i know who that is. please welcome the pottydactyl.  potty:  sorry i'm late. patchy: potty. why aren't you wearing your costume.  i stayed up all night making it. potty:  you're wasting your time, old man. prehistoric stuff is lame. everybody knows the future's where it's at. patchy: what..  that's not true. don't mind him, folks. why even spongebob squarepants knows that prehistoric stuff is, what the kids say,  cool. potty:  no he doesn't. patchy: yes he does. potty: nope. patchy: he most certainly does. potty: no he doesn't. patchy: yes he does. potty: no. patchy:  i know for a fact that he does. potty: not.  narrator: meanwhile...  mr. krabs: spongebob. what's wrong. spongebob: i don't know, mr. krabs, but i've got this strangest feeling that somewhere a pirate and parrot are arguing about me.  and the parrot is winning.  patchy: does. potty: doesn't. patchy: does. potty: doesn't. patchy: does. potty: doesn't. patchy: does. uh, look, while we're arguing, why don't you folks go ahead and watch some prehistoric spongebob. roll the cartoon. does. potty: doesn't.  narrator: ah, dawn breaks over the primordial sea.  it's here that millions of years ago, life began taking its first clumsy steps out of the darkness, opening its newlyformed eyeballs to stare into the blinding light of intelligence, in order toumm... never mind. this happened a long time ago.  spongegar: banooga ready. tabonga, gary.

i have something that you'll never find in your little  future: a real live caveman. hmm  hey, there he is. come on in, little troglodyte fella. come on  you see kids, i found him frozen in a block of ice and then i spent three days thawing him out with my mom's hair dryer. i call him cavey.  isn't he something. it's ok, cavey.  potty: that's nothing, old timer. make way for the future.  robot:

untold.  patchy: now i know how squidward feels  potty:  why the long face. patchy: i think you know perfectly well, you little winged vermin. all i wanted was to show the nice people how great the cavemen were. but all they got was technologyinduced chaos. potty: come back inside. i think you'll be pleasantly surprised. patchy: you got rid of the robot android cyborg.. potty: nope, even better.  patchy:  potty, i guess i really misjudged you  what the...  song: "when worlds collide" when worlds collide potty: pretty sweet, eh. you can run but no can hide when worlds collide you'll laugh so hard you'll swear you've died when worlds collide hold my hand i'll be your guide when worlds collide buckle...buckle...buckle up for the sweetest ride and prepare to have your mind blown wide when worlds collide when worlds collide, it's a curious thing bet you never heard a robot and a caveman sing in his metal chest are some working parts how is that different from my beating heart. i'm from the future, and i'm from the past but that don't mean this friendship wasn't built to last he was made in a lab, and i was born in a cave so let me hear you holler for this interera rave squidward:  future. potty: word. spongetron:  i am spongetron. you, you, you, you can run but you can't hide when worlds collide  patchy: well potty, i guess you were right. the future is cool. potty: just to
