plankton: ha.  mr. krabs: hold it right there, plankton. plankton: krabs. mr. krabs: i'll take that.  plankton: how'd you know it was me. mr. krabs: next time, wear a disguise without your initial on it. plankton: hmmm... perhaps a peppershaker was a bit obvious. mr. krabs: you think. spongebob.  spongebob: woooooo.  announcer:  3, 2, 1, launch.  plankton: aahh.  plankton: never. never. i'll never get krabs' formula. mr. krabs is too smart and is too powerful. if only there were a way to render him helpless. sadie:  oh, look at you, you're so small, tiny and helpless. plankton: hey, i resent that. sadie:  why, you're so tiny and helpless, i could give you formula whenever i wanted to and you couldn't do a thing about it.  plankton: something about that woman reminds me of my mother. that's it. finally, victory will be mine. i'll turn eugene krabs into a powerlessbaby.  mr. krabs:  ooh, a penny.  a trail of pennies.  plankton:  i've done it. nothing can stop me now. my goo goo gas will transform krabs into a tiny helpless infant.  the key to the krusty krab. this is easier than i hoped.  he's a little bigger than i imagined.  ow. ow. ow.  spongebob: hey, a baby. what are you doing out here alone, baby. i'll take charge of you until your mommy shows up. oh, you're just too cute. plankton: hello. if you're done making a total fool out of yourself, i could use some help with this lock. spongebob: oh, sure thing, plankton. here you go, little guy. plankton: yes, my plan is working perfectly, now that i've turned krabs into a helpless baby, the krabby patty formula will be mine. hello. spongebob:  police. police. plankton:  fools, you'll never hold me. your primitive shackles are no match for my genius.  i'm free. free.  spongebob: oh, squidward. thank neptune you're here. i found this baby all alone. but he wasn't really alone, he was with plankton. and he's not a baby. it's mr. krabs. plankton turned him into a baby so he could steal the krabby patty secret formula.  what do we do, squidward. squidward: i don't know about you, but i'm going on my coffee break. a very long coffee break.  plankton:  and then that blasted sponge called the cops. that's just not cricket.  now i'll never be a tyrannical overlord. karen: do i have to tell you how to do everything. next time, spray spongebob, too. plankton: not sure. karen: listen carefully. spray... plankton: yes. karen: ...sponge.... plankton: uhhuh. karen: ....bob..... plankton: right. karen: ....too. plankton: now you're just talking gibberish. what i really need is to spray mr. krabs and spongebob. karen: that's just what i plankton: i don't wanna hear all your loony schemes, karen. i've got work to do.  spongebob: aw, what's wrong, mr. baby krabs. are you thirsty.  that's it, drink up.  ok, maybe you're hungry. how about a nice soft krabby patty.  not even a krabby patty helps. how about a stack of 20s.  plankton: hands in the air. spongebob: plankton. plankton: that's right, spongebob, i'm back. and you won't stop me this time.  what. spongebob's a baby but krabs is back to normal  it seems the second dose acts as an antidote.  one squirt equals baby, two squirts equals adult.  or is it three squirts for baby and four squirts for adult.  barnacles, i've run out of gas. mr. krabs: ahem. plankton: krabs. nice diaper.  come on, come on.  i've got it. mr. krabs:  better be something other than bills this time.  plankton. plankton: peekaboo. mr. krabs:  i can't tolerate your stinky gas. dennis:  miss shell: that makes two of us. dennis: i don't do it on purpose. mr. krabs: you'll never catch me, plankton. never. oohanother penny. come to papa. now were we doing. plankton: this.  what's the matter, baby. are you gonna cry.  what the heck happened to you. this isn't baby gas. it's senior citizen spray. mr. krabs: eh. what was that, sonny. plankton: out of my way, methuselah. you're old and useless.  spongebob: hold it right there. old people are out greatest natural resource. i salute you, elder citizenry. plankton: i'm getting old listening to this. let's try this again.  spongebob: i remember when a quarter used to cost a nickel. plankton: this baby gas is worthless. at least you're way too old to stop me from stealing a krabby patty. spongebob: what was that, sonny. plankton: it'll take more time to explain than you have left. spongebob: what. mr. krabs: he's got the krabby patty. catch him. spongebob: catch who. mr. krabs: oh, gesundheit. plankton: victory is mine.  spongebob: come back here, you little whippersnapper. mr. krabs: you kids get off my lawn. i'll catch up with you, boy. spongebob: i'm catching up with my knitting. mr. krabs:  that's it. knit, little nitwit. plankton: that was almost too easy.  no. i demand you geezers release me. mr. krabs: right after the party. the piata party. plankton: what. senior citizens: that's for calling us old. i want candy.  plankton: 1 squirt equals baby, carry over the 2 plus the square root of spongebob. of course. the final ingredient i'm lacking. it's so simple yet so evil. and i know just where to get it.  plankton: excuse me, what aisle did you get that from. shubie: you mean the kelpo. plankton: no, that thing. the ugly drippy smelly thing. shubie: are you talking about my baby, creep.  plankton: ow ow ow.  baby powder. this could be just what i need. hey buddy, is this made of real or artificial babies.  ow ow ow ow.  that powdered baby did the trick. now my baby gas can't possibly fail. karen: just like all your plans that "couldn't possibly fail." plankton: what is it now, karen. karen: i'm saying you should test your gas before you come running there all willy nilly. plankton: that's an excellent idea. and i know just the guinea pig.  karen:  plankton, don't you dare.  plankton: karen. speak to me.  it worked.  plankton: everyone say your abcs.  now when you turn into babies,  you stay babies. hey, krabs, catch.  spongebob: what's wrong, little feller.    plankton: my moment of triumph.  what the....  oh, gross. i command you to stop drooling on me. baby mr. krabs: goo. plankton:  put me down.  ow. stop it. i'm an adult.  plankton: yeow.  huh. i don't believe it. krabby patty formula. he's teething on it.  give it here, you big stupid baby.  ow.  i've got it. just like taking candy from a baby. get it, krabs. i'm taking candy from you.  hey. what are you doing.  uhoh.  ahem.  mama's evil little genius needs a diaper. ) )
