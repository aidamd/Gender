spongebob: hey, squidward. hey, squidward. hey, squidward. hey, squidward. hey, squidward. squidward: all right, i'll bite. what is it, spongebob. spongebob: do you know what today is. squidward: annoy squidward day. spongebob:  no, silly.  that's on the 15th.  today is the beginning of the judging for employee of the month. squidward: spongebob, don't you know that award's a scam. spongebob: what do you mean. squidward: mr. krabs gives you that award so you'll work harder for no extra money. spongebob: that is not true, squidward. he gives it to me because i work harder. you could win it too, if you tried harder. squidward: oh, for what. to get my face on the wall of shame.  spongebob: squidward, you've got it all wrong. having pride in your work is nothing to be ashamed of, why it's the only thing that makes it all worthwhile. mr. krabs: thattaboy, spongebob. this is going to be a tough one though. there's no clear cut winner.  watch out, spongebob. squidward appears to be on the verge of a breakout.  there might be a new face on the wall this month. spongebob: huh.  squidward: that's right, spongebob. i might sneak up on you.  spongebob: no.  how could i have let the quality of my work slip so much..  squidward:  need some help.  what are you doing. spongebob: making...krabby patties. squidward: you're losing it. don't you know that award is a load of...  ...garbage. spongebob:  please don't tell mr. krabs about this. it'll hurt my chances of winning the award. squidward: i already told you, that award is a bunch of...  ...baloney. spongebob: that is not true, squidward. like this hat, that award is a symbol of... squidward:  it's a symbol that you're a chump.  spongebob: no, squidward.  squidward: and this is a symbol of what i think of the 'employee of the month' award.  spongebob: an experienced employee of the month always keeps a brick of lead in his hat. squidward: i'm telling you for the last time, that award is nothing but a joke.  spongebob: what if squidward's right. what if the award is a phony. does this mean my whole body of work is meaningless..  spongebob picture: stop that kind of talk, sailor. this is war now, private. that's exactly what he wants you to think. this is no time to go lilylivered on us. spongebob: but, sir spongebob picture: there's no room for "but"s in war, soldier. he wants you to crack. he's trying to trick you, get inside your mind. you will stop at nothing, and i mean nothing to defeat him. have i made myself clear, private. spongebob: crystal, sir. spongebob picture: good. now move out.  spongebob: i won't let squidward win.  he can't go to work if he doesn't wake up. target sited.  squidward: spongebob. what are you doing here.  spongebob: you can't win that award if you don't get up for work.  squidward: stop it, spongebob. if i really wanted that award, i could win it with my tentacles tied. spongebob: that can be arranged. squidward: you're a lunatic, spongebob. spongebob: maybe so, but i did win 'employee of the month' 26 months in a row. squidward: are you trying to say that you are better than me.. spongebob: i've been better than you 26 months and it'll be 27 tomorrow. squidward: oh, that's it, squareforbrains. that's it. i'm going to show you how easy it is to win that award. i'm going to be the new 'employee of the month'. i will prove to you that i am far more competent than you. spongebob: well, i'm going in early to wax the floors. squidward: don't bother. i'll have done it already by the time you get there. spongebob: well, you'll have to get up pretty early to get there before me. squidward: i don't need to sleep. loser. spongebob: well, me neither. 26time loser.  look at him. watchin' me. squidward: i'm watching you, spongebob. you're not leaving before me. spongebob: hey squidward, getting sleepy huh. squidward: no, how about you. spongebob: nope.  nighty night.  squidward: spongebob.  spongebob: hey, squidward. going somewhere. squidward: i'm going to wring you dry when i get out of here. now get me out of here. spongebob: all right, squidward. i'll stop by after work. squidward: spongebob. spongebob.  spongebob: now to get some rest. don't want to look tired for my 'employee of the month' photo.  squidward.  squidward: that oughta hold him.  squidward:  spongebob. why you little.  spongebob: ha ha ha ha ha. hmmm, a krabby patty.  ow. squidward. squidward: so long, sponge loser.  spongebob. truce.  spongebob: truce. squidward: spongebob, i can't take it anymore. if we keep this up, neither of us will win the award. spongebob: you're right. we should save our energy for work where we really need it.  squidward: ok, let's have a good clean fight. spongebob: and may the better man win.  he's nothing but a lying, boneless, inksquirting, bignosed phony. squidward:  look at that bucktoothed, cornfed smile. you can't trust him as far as you can throw him. spongebob:  as soon as he stops shaking my hand... squidward:  ...i'm gonna make a run for it.  mr. krabs: money, money, gonna make some money.  ah, it warms me wallet to see me employees coming in so early. boys, you're early.  wait.  spongebob: look, mr. krabs. clean floors. squidward: clean tables, mr. krabs.  spongebob: clean dishes, mr. krabs. mr. krabs: what's going on here..  spongebob: it's much more efficient to clean dishes this way, mr. krabs. mr. krabs: no. squidward: flowers and chocolate for you, mr. krabs. spongebob: look, i'm putting my own money in the register, mr. krabs.  two spatulas to increase productivity, mr. krabs. faster, spongebob, faster. squidward: there's nothing to this patty flipping, mr. krabs. i'll easily double you output, spongehog. mr. krabs: boys, boys, boys.  help. help.  frank: hey, free krabby patties.  mr. krabs: wait, you've got to pay for those. wait, wait, wait. boys, the krabby patties. spongebob: so, who's the winner of employee of the month. squidward: me, me. it's me.  mr. krabs: boys. wait. boys, the krabby patties. boys, wait. ) )
