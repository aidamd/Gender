they're saying. they're saying: owners, owners, owners, owners, owners, owners, owners. please, please, please, please please, please, please don't be this way. they're saying they don't want this type of pampering. they want to be treated as companions, not dressup dolls. they don't want scratchy outfits, they want to be scratched. they are protesting the indignity of wigs and jewelencrusted collars and they want to be free from superficial and degrading pageants, like these. pets: meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow. spongebob: you were trying to tell me that all along weren't you, gary. gary: meow, meow. spongebob: well, i won't let it happen again. judge: well, i think we can all agree that this years groomers cup goes to... spongebob and his wonderful pet. spongebob: did you hear that, gary. they're rewarding you for standing up and speaking out against injustice. maybe these pageants aren't so superficial after all. judge: what are you talking about. the snail didn't win, i was referring to your other pet. he's so adorable. patrick: woof, woof.  ) )
