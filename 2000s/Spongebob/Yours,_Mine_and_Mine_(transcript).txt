mr. krabs: whoa, whoa, whoa. hey, settle down. all this brawling is over a toy. you two shouldn't let a little trinkle between youse two. you should be ashamed of yourselves. if i give you each of ya another toy, would that make you happy. spongebob and patrick: yes. mr. krabs: well, you're in luck. you two so thrilled with a toy. i'm have entire case e'made. i've been selling my hotcakes. that'll
