i cleaned it this morning. mr. krabs: doesn't your spatula need aligning or something. spongebob: nope, she's perfectly aligned.  mr. krabs: drat your efficiency. uh, oh, yeah.  i can't serve you your patty until after the show. plankton: what show.  mr. krabs: the show that comes with a free krabby patty.  see. plankton: oh, come on. are you kidding me. agent twirp: it clearly says, "and a show." i'll allow it. plankton: drat.  plankton: is this part of  "the show."  mr. krabs: no, this is isn't part of the show.  agent twirp: mm, such lovely filigree, wouldn't you agree. plankton: ugh.  spongebob: puppets. mr. krabs: once upon a time, there was a happy patty laddie. patty laddie: la la la la la la la la. mr. krabs: he was beloved by all the goodhearted people in the world. alas, there is also a villain in this story, by the name of  plflankton. spongebob: boo. hiss.  mr. krabs: so, one day, when the lad was minding his own business, flankton struck and took a huge bite out of the laddie's face.  plankton: okay, we get it already. mr. krabs: unfortunately for flankton,  the patty didn't sit well with him. and he was so evil, it caused him to bloat something fierce...  ...until eventually he popped.  the end. plankton:  oh, bravo. bravo. why does the puppet get to eat a krabby patty and i don't. and why aren't you in the kitchen cooking my patty. mr. krabs: alright, spongebob, we can't stall him any longer. make it a good one, laddie. this may be the last patty you'll ever cook. spongebob: i'll do my best, sir.  mr. krabs:  psst. i got a plan. you keep that blasted bureaucrat busy.  squidward: uh, excuse me, mr. agent, sir. while we're waiting, perhaps i could direct your attention tooh, the many code violations you'll find  if you turn this way. it's a death trap.  mr. krabs: there we go.  ooh, that takes care of that.  and in three, two, one. spongebob: mr. krabs. mr. krabs: spongebob. spongebob: mr. krabs, it's awful. we're all out of buns. mr. krabs: no buns. drat the luck. truck driver: got a delivery for the krusty krab. where do you want us to put these buns. spongebob: huh, good thing i ordered us extra bfor the contest crowd.  plankton: finally. at long last, the krabby patty is mine. go ahead and wrap that up, son. i'll take it to go. spongebob: one krabby patty to go.   here you are. mr. krabs: oh, no, you don't.  you have to eat it on the premises.  them's the rules.  plankton: yeah, that's what it says. mr. krabs: so. plankton: okay, okay. i will.  i bid you good day, sir.  mr. krabs: you gotta swallow it here on the premises. plankton: oh, come on. agent twirp: i'll allow it. plankton: fine.  can i go now.  plankton: karen, quick. you gotta cut this krabby patty out of me, stat. karen: but what about anesthetic. plankton: there's no time. i can feel it digesting.  karen: whatever you say, dear. hold still.  this may pinch a little.  spongebob: uh, mr. krabs. mr. krabs: what is it, lad. spongebob: take a look.  plankton: keep it moving, nice and orderly. hey, eugene, want a free krabby patty. just guess how many customers i can fit into the chum bucket.  abigail marge: i feel terrible. the krabby patty takes like stomach acid.  henrybart: it tastes like aspirin and carrots.  ugh, get it off. get it off.  plankton: wait, come back. oh, come on, karen. what happened. karen: i just did what you asked.  i analyzed the contents of your stomach and used them to synthesize a  krabby patty.  mr. krabs: it warms my heart to see that little twerp fail. okay, boyo, fun time's over.  now go fish them buns out of the toilet. oh, yeah  and put these seeds back on 'em. spongebob: that's my krabs.  ) )
