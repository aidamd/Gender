mr. krabs: you'll never get me secret krabby patty formula, plankton. adios.  sandy: hmm.  plankton, you look like the cheese that fell off the cracker. i bet you tried to get that formula again. plankton:  i don't get it. a crab's brain is smaller than the point of a pencil, but he keeps outsmarting me.  sandy: you should give up that formula. mr. krabs would have to be as dumb as patrick. plankton:  yes.  yes he would. as dumb as patrick.   plankton: one swab from the inside of his cheek should do it.  plankton: nagging neptune.  back you twisted tongue. you will not lick me.  plankton: sweet gashes molasses.  karen: oh, peeyew. what's that awful stench. you're not boiling your underpants again, are you.  plankton: i told you to turn off that laugh track. and if you must know, i made sauce.  but when i add patrick's dna to it, it'll become salsa imbecilicus.  plankton: idiot sauce.  i'll serve it to krabs and it'll make him so dumb, he'll just give me the secret formula. huh. huh. karen: i think i'd prefer the boiling underpants.  let me do it. you always make a mess. plankton: leave me be woman. karen: don't tell me...   plankton: oh no.  squidward: i've got the best taste in town. duh.  sandy: i never thought that folks around here were particularly bright. but this morning everyone seems as dumb as traffic cones.  sandy: what happened to your head, spongebob. spongebob: uh, me make krabby patties. sandy: uh, that's mud.  sandy: hey, patrick. have you noticed that everyone's acting a lot like you today.  patrick: i don't understand the question.  sandy: what in sam hill.  sandy: hey, don't do that.  sandy: lining up for the chum bucket. now, i know everyone's got a hole in their screen door. this place is ground zero for zero.  sandy:  zero as being everyone's collected by goo.  karen: and that's how the idiot sauce spread throughout bikini bottom. i guess you weren't affected because you were protected by your treedome. sandy: and you weren't affected because you're a computer. looks like it's up to us to find a cure for the town's idiocy.  plankton: you not plankton. me plankton.  karen: we need to snap him out of this. what's the opposite of dim. sandy: bright.  karen: it's not working. maybe we can feed him something for brain food. you're smart. what do you eat.  sandy: nuts.  sandy: oh, it doesn't seem to be working. you know him. how do you get him to change. karen: i usually just yell at him. get smart, dummy. sandy: wise up. karen: be clever, idiot. sandy: no things.  karen:  it's no use. being smart takes work. sandy:  that gives me an idea.  sandy: come one, come all to bikini bottom university. a free education for all. there's no more excuse for being a dope. step right up all you morons. classes are now beginning.  sandy: aww. this isn't working. karen: try jiggling the keys.  sandy: good mornin', students.  sandy: a whole school full of patricks. looks like we've got our work cut out for us.  french narrator: one semester later...  sandy: and don't forget your last homework assignment. karen: looks like we were able to educate the whole town in one semester. sandy: yep. day after tomorrow is graduation. and everybody learned so well. karen: everybody but one.  plankton:  yeah. mr. krabs: school is dumb. you've misspelled every word. plankton: shut up, dweeb.  plankton: cook books, eh. you holdin' out on me, krabs.  mr. krabs: i don't know what you're talkin' about, plankton. leave me alone.  plankton: i know you're cookin' up something special in home ec, eugene. i want that formula. spongebob: um, plankton, can i come out now. plankton: did you finish my homework for me, nerd. spongebob: yeah.  spongebob: you know, you really ought to do your own homework. it's the only way you'll learn. plankton: i'll never learn.  plankton: not again. french narrator: ahh. graduation day.  sandy: this is a proud day for everyone in bikini bottom. and as a treat, squidward will play pomp and circumstance on the clarinet.  spongebob: hurry up, mr. krabs. they're handing out the diplomas. mr. krabs: just a minute. i think i've perfected the krabby patty formula.  yes. that's it. spongebob: great. well, see ya out there.  plankton: somethin' smells good.  mr. krabs: oh. p...p...plankton. what are you doin' here. plankton: it's the last day of school, baby. no need to be formal. call me sheldon.  great neptune. that's perfection. well, with this recipe, i could own the most popular fast food restaurant in bikini bottom. mr. krabs:  no, please. not that. anything but that. plankton: hand over that secret formula, krabs.  karen: congratulations, spongebob. you're smart now. it's funny that mr. krabs never showed up to get his diploma. spongebob: yeah. the only two people who didn't show up are mr. krabs and plankton.  let me have that diploma.  patrick: uh, hey. no running in the halls.  mr. krabs: here you go, plankton.  spongebob: mr. krabs, your diploma.  mr. krabs: thanks to this here diploma, i'm suddenly smart enough to never give you me secret formula. plankton: what.. if i knew education worked like that, i would have bought a diploma years ago. mr. krabs: of course it doesn't work like that, you microscopic meathead. i took accelerated classes and graduated months ago. this diploma is just a formality. plankton: but... but you were just about to give me the formula. y..you were scared of me.  sandy: excellent, mr. krabs.  here's your final grade for acting class. a+.  i've really felt the fear. plankton: wait, what.. acting class..  no.. mr. krabs: you've finally been schooled, dropout.  karen: come on, evil genius. time to start your postcollege years.  ) )
