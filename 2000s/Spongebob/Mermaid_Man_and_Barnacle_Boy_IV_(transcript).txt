spongebob: patrick, no. that's not an action figure. that's the real squidward. i shrunk him by accident. patrick: oh...  and then comes a giant fist.  spongebob:  pat, you don't understand. this is serious. i don't know how to unshrink him. he could be stuck like this for the rest of his life. patrick: oh, don't worry about it. he'll find love one day. spongebob: you think so. patrick: well, sure. but it'll be with someone his own size.  like this pickle. see. they like each other. squidward: nnnnno.  spongebob: oh, if only i knew how to work this thing. patrick: let me take a look at it. hmmm. you know what the problem is. spongebob: what. patrick: you got it set to  'm' for mini when it should be set to  'w' for wumbo. spongebob: patrick, i don't think wumbo is a real word. patrick:

fall from this height could be enough to kill me. spongebob: patrick, i'm sorry i doubted you. patrick: well alright then. let 'er rip.  it worked. spongebob: oh no. patrick: look, spongebob's giant.  can i be giant next. spongebob: patrick, i'm not giant, you shrunk too. patrick: you're kidding.  good thing i still got this pickle.  squidward: hey. now will you take us to mermaid man.. spongebob:

need an elevator to climb one stair. hiya.  mermaid man: we've been shrinking for years. barnacle boy: but this is ridiculous.  everyone: everything's too big. spongebob: i've got it.  tada.  since i couldn't make you big, i made the city small.  and now, only one more thing to shrink. cheese.  squidward: i guess this is okay. larry: yeah, what's the difference. nancy: good idea, spongebob.
