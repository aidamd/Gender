plankton: oh, karen, my computer wife, if only i could have managed to steal the secret to krabs' success, the formula for the krabby patty. then people would line up to eat at my restaurant. lord

mr. krabs: uh, spongebob. spongebob: hold the phone, folks, i'm getting an important news flash from mr. krabs. go ahead, mr. k.  i'm making a complete what of myself.  the most embarrassing thing you've ever seen.  and now it's worse because i'm repeating everything you say into the microphone. mr. krabs: oh, for crying out loud, spongebob. you didn't get the job. spongebob: what. mr. krabs: you... did not... get... the job. spongebob: but... but why. mr. krabs: spongebob, you're a great fry cook, but i gave the job to squidward because being manager is a big responsibility. well, let's face it, he's more... mature than you. spongebob: i'm not... mature. mr. krabs: lad, i mean this in the nicest of ways, but there's a word for what you are, and that word is... now, let's see... lenny: dork. mr. krabs: no, wait, that's not right. not a dork. pearl: a goofball. mr. krabs: closer, but no, no, no. fred: a dingaling. jimmy: wing nut. mable: a knucklehead mcspazatron. mr. krabs: ok, that's enough. look, what i'm trying to say is, you're just a kid. and to be a manager, you have to be a man. otherwise they'd call it "kidager." you understandager. i mean, you understand. spongebob: i guess so, mr. krabs. mr. krabs: spongebob.  spongebob : i'm ready. depression. i'm ready. depression. mr. krabs: poor kid.  patrick: hooray for spongebob. hooray for spongebob.  patrick: let's hear it for spongebob. hello. where'd everybody go. did i miss something. did you see my butt. french narrator: later that evening...  plankton: time to put plan z into effect. starting at the undersea castle of king neptune.  squire: oh, right.  the royal court is now in session. bring the prisoner forward.  neptune: so, you have confessed to the crime of touching the king's crown. prisoner: yes, but... neptune: but what.. prisoner: but it's my job, your highness. i'm the royal crown polisher. neptune: well, then i guess i can't execute you. twenty years in the dungeon it is. mindy: daddy.  you're free to go. crown polisher: bless you, princess mindy.  neptune: mindy, how dare you defy me.. mindy: why do you have to be so mean. neptune: i am the king. i must enforce the laws of the sea. mindy: father, i wish you'd try a little love and compassion instead of these harsh punishments. squire: that would be nice.  neptune: squire, clear the room. i wish to speak to my daughter alone.  what is this, mindy. mindy: your crown. neptune: and what does this crown do. mindy: it covers your bald spot. neptune: it's not bald, it's... thinning. this crown does much more than cover a slightly receding hairline.  no, this crown entitles the one who wears it to be in charge of the sea. one day, you will wear this crown. mindy: i'm gonna be bald.. neptune: thinning. anyway, the point is, you won't wear it until you learn how to rule with an iron fist. like your father.  mindy: dad, your "crown"... neptune: what the....  my crown. someone has stolen the royal crown. plankton:  i got it. i got it.  goofy goober clock: hey, all you goobers, it's time to say howdy to your favorite undersea peanut, goofy goober. kids: howdy, goofy goober. goofy goober: hey, fellow goofy goobers. time to sing. goofy goober: .oh, i'm a goofy goober, yeah. you're a goofy goober, yeah. we're all goofy goobers, yeah.. goofy goober and kids: .goofy, goofy, goober, goober, yeah..  spongebob: all right. get it together, old boy. i know. i'll just stop thinking about it. hey, you know, i actually feel a little better. i don't even remember why i was sad.  patrick: hey, it's the new krusty krab 2 manager.  wow, the pressure's already setting in. spongebob: no, pat, you don't understand. i didn't get the promotion. patrick: what. why. spongebob: mr. krabs thinks i'm a kid. patrick:  what.. that's insane. spongebob: i know. patrick: well, saying you're a kid, it's like saying i'm a kid.  waiter: here's your goober meal, sir. patrick: i'm supposed to get a toy with this.  thanks. spongebob:  i'm gonna head home, pat. the celebration's off. patrick: are you sure. spongebob: yeah. i'm not in a goober mood.  patrick: okay, see you. waiter:  and here's your triple gooberberry sunrise, sir.  patrick: yum. spongebob: a triple gooberberry sunrise, huh. i guess i could use one of those. patrick: now you're talking. hey, waiter, we need another one over here. waiter:  there you go. spongebob: ooh.  both: buuurrrp. spongebob: boy, pat, that hit the spot. i'm feeling better already. patrick: yeah. spongebob: waiter, let's get another round over here.  oh, mr. waiter. two more, please.  both: whoo.  spongebob: waiter.  oh, waiter.  waiter.  waitoor.  waiter. waiter:  why do i always get the nuts. spongebob:  all right, folks, this one goes out to my two bestest friends in the whole world:  patrick and this big peanut guy. it's a little ditty called... both: "waiter."  waiter:  hey. hey, get up. hey, come on, buddy. i wanna go home. come on, pal. spongebob:  oh, my head.  waiter: listen to me. it's 8 in the morning. go scrape up your friend and get going. spongebob: my friend.  patrick. hey, what's up, buddy.  wait, you said 8:00. i'm late for work. mr. krabs is gonna be... mr. krabs.  mr. krabs: now, pay attention, squidward. as new manager, you've gotta keep a sharp eye out for paying customers.  squidward: yawn. mr. krabs: what's this. king neptune is riding toward the krusty krab at lunchtime. he's got money.  neptune: stay in the coach, daughter.  this won't take long. mindy: daddy, please. i think you're overreacting. neptune: silence, mindy. i know what i'm doing.  oww. squire.  squire: yes, your highness. neptune: have this pole executed at once.  squidward: a hundred and one dollars for a krabby patty. mr. krabs: with cheese, mr. squidward, with cheese.  neptune:  greeting, subjects. i seek the one known as eugene krabs. may he present himself to me at once. mr. krabs: i'm eugene krabs, your highness. would you like to order something. neptune:  nay. i'm on to you, krabs. you have stolen the royal crown, you cannot deny. for, clever as you are, you left one damning piece of evidence at the scene of the crime.  mr. krabs: "i stole your crown. signed, eugene krabs.."  neptune: relinquish the royal crown to me at once. mr. krabs: but... but this is crazy. i didn't do it. the phone:  ahoy, this is eugene krabs. leave a message. clay:  hi, mr. krabs. this is clay, the guy you sold neptune's crown to. yeah, i just wanted to say thanks again for selling me the crown. neptune's crown. i sold it to a guy in shell city, and i just wanted to say thanks again for selling me the crown. neptune's crown.  which is now in shell city. goodbye. mr. krabs: heh, heh.... don't you just hate wrong numbers. neptune: my crown is in the forbidden shell city..   plankton: plan z. i love plan z. king neptune:  prepare to burn, krabs. mr. krabs:  wait, neptune. please, i'm begging you. i ain't a crook. ask anyone, they'll vouch for me. king neptune: very well, then. before i turn this conniving crustacean into fishmeal, who here has anything to say about eugene krabs. spongebob:  i've got something to say about mr.  krabs. mr. krabs: spongebob, me boy, you've come just in time. please, tell king neptune all about me. spongebob: i have worked for mr. krabs for many years and always thought he was a great boss. mr. krabs: you see. a great boss. spongebob:  i now realize that he's a great big jerk. i deserve that manager's job. but you didn't give it to me, because you say i'm a kid. well, i am 100% man. and this man has got something to say to you.  there, i think i made my point. king neptune: anyone else. no. well, then.  spongebob: huh. mr. krabs: ooh. me pants are on fire. me underwear's on fire. i'm on fire.  oh, yeah. king neptune: and now, eugene krabs,  you... will... spongebob: wait. i'm flattered you would do this on my account, but being manager isn't worth killing mr. krabs over. king neptune: quiet, fool. mr. krabs stole my crown, and now it's in shell city. that's why he must die. spongebob: doesn't it seem a little harsh to kill someone over a crown. king neptune: you don't understand. my crown is a symbol of my kinglike authority. and between you and me... my hair is thinning a bit. spongebob: oh, your highness, i'm sure it's not that noticeable... bald. bald.}}  fred: my eyes. king neptune:  all right, all right. spongebob: king neptune, sir. would you spare mr. krabs' life if i went to get your crown back. king neptune: you, go to shell city.  no one who's gone to shell city has ever returned. what makes you think you could. you're just a kid. spongebob: but i'm not a kid. i can do it. king neptune: run along. i have a crab to cook. spongebob: no. i won't let you. king neptune: very well, then. i'll have to fry you both. mindy: daddy, stop it. can't you get through one day without executing someone. king neptune: mindy, i told you to stay in the carriage. mindy: where's your love and compassion.  look at this little guy. he's willing to risk his life to find your crown and save his boss. king neptune: but, daughter, i... mindy: please, father. at least let him try. what have you got to lose. might i remind you of your special problem.  all: bald. bald. bald. fred: my eyes. king neptune:  all right. very well, mindy. i'll give him a chance. but when your little champion fails to return, i get to splatter this crab all over the walls. mr. krabs: huh. king neptune: and as for you, be back here with my crown in exactly 10 days.  patrick: he can do it in 9. king neptune: 8. patrick: 7. king neptune: 6. spongebob & mr. krabs: patrick.  king neptune: six it is, then. patrick:  five. spongebob: patrick, shush. king neptune: until then, the crab shall remain frozen where he now stands.  mr. krabs: no, wait. i'm begging you.  squidward: who turned on the ac.  mr. krabs. oh, no, this is terrible. who's gonna sign my paycheck. king neptune: come along, mindy. mindy: listen, you guys, the road to shell city is really dangerous. there's crooks, killers and monsters everywhere. and what's worse, there's a giant cyclops  who guards the outskirts of the city and preys on innocent sea creatures. don't let him catch you, because if he does, he'll take you back to his lair, and you'll never be seen again.  patrick: she's pretty, spongebob. mindy: here, take this. spongebob: what's in here.  mindy: it's a magical bag of winds. i stole them from my father. patrick:  you're hot. mindy: once you find the crown, open the bag of winds and you'll be blown back home. neptune:  mindy. mindy: i'm coming. good luck, spongebob. spongebob: wait. how did you know my name. mindy: oh, i'm gonna be queen of the sea one day. i've learned the names of all the sea creatures. patrick: what's my name. mindy: that's easy. you're patrick star.  neptune: mindy. mindy: i gotta go. i believe in you guys. spongebob: thanks, mindy.  don't worry, mr. krabs. patrick, squidward and i... squidward: pass.  spongebob: patrick and i... patrick: hi. spongebob: ... are gonna get that crown back and save you from neptune's wrath. you've got nothing to worry about. your life is in our hands.  patrick, let's go get that crown.  spongebob: feast your eyes, patrick. patrick: what is it. spongebob: the patty wagon. mr. krabs uses it for promotional reasons. let me show you some of its features. sesameseed finish, steelbelted pickles, grilledleather interior. and under the hood, a fuelinjected frenchfryer with dual overhead grease traps. patrick: wow. spongebob: yeah, wow. patrick: hey, i thought you didn't have a driver's license. spongebob: you don't need a license to drive a sandwich.  spongebob and patrick:

squidward: it means you set up mr. krabs. you stole the crown so neptune would freeze him and you could finally get your stubby little paws on the krabby patty formula.  it was you all along. but you made one fatal mistake. you messed with my paycheck. and i'm gonna report you to the highest authority in the land, king neptune. plankton: we'll see about that, inspector looselips.  karen: now

kickball on the playground. you never had a chance to defeat me, fool. and you know why. spongebob: because you cheated. plankton: no, not because i cheated. because i'm an evil genius. and you're just a kid. a stupid kid. spongebob: i guess you're right, plankton. i am just a kid. plankton: of course i'm right. okay, neptune, time to kill. spongebob: and you know, i've been through a lot in the past six days, five minutes, twentysevenandahalf seconds. and if i've learned anything during that time, it's that you are who you are. plankton: that's right. okay, neptune... spongebob: and no amount of mermaid magic...  ...or managerial promotion...  ...or some other third thing...can make me anything more than what i really am inside: a kid. plankton: that's great. now, get back against the wall. spongebob:  but that's okay. plankton: what. what's going on. spongebob: because i did what everyone said a kid couldn't do. i made it to shell city, and i beat the cyclops, and i rode the hasselhoff, and i brought the crown back. plankton: all right, we get the point. spongebob: so, yeah, i'm a kid.  and i'm also a goofball. and a wing nut. and a knucklehead mcspazatron. plankton:  what's going on here. spongebob: but most of all, i'm... plankton: okay, settle down. take it easy. spongebob: i'm... i'm... plankton: what the scallop.. spongebob:  .i'm a goofy goober. rock..  .you're a goofy goober. rock. we're all goofy goobers. rock. goofy, goofy, goober, goober. put your toys away. well, all i gotta say when you tell me not to play, i say no way. no way. no, no freaking way. i'm a kid, you say, when you say i'm a kid i say, say it again and then i say thanks. thanks. thank you very much. so if you're thinking that you'd like to be like me, go ahead and try. the kid inside will set you free. i'm a goofy goober. rock.. plankton:  what's happening.  his dance moves are impressive, but i'm in control.  seize him. people: all hail plankton.  fred:  i'm free. i've been freed. plankton: what.  no.  my precious helmets. squidward: huh. mrs. puff: oh. sandy: yeehaw. gary: meow. plankton: his chops are too righteous. the helmets can't handle this level of rock 'n' roll. karen, do something. karen.  all right, that's the last straw. neptune, i command you to... mindy: here you go, daddy. plankton: i better get outta here.  sandals: look, it's the wizard who saved us. plankton: out of my way, fools.  ow. ow. oooooooow.  plankton:  come on, i was just kidding. come on, you guys knew that, didn't you. with the helmets and the big monuments...wasn't that hilarious, everybody.  i will destroy all of you.  neptune: well, mindy, i have to admit, you were right. your compassion for these sea creatures proved a most admirable trait. without it, i would have never again seen my beloved crown. i think you're going to make a fine ruler of the sea one day. now, let's go home.  mindy: daddy, haven't you forgotten something. neptune: what. oh, yeah. eugene krabs, i forgot to unfreeze you.  mr. krabs: what the.... neptune: i guess i had it set to "real boy" ending.  mr. krabs: yippee. neptune: oh, i'm sorry for falsely freezing you, krabs. and may i say, sir, you are a very lucky fellow to have in your employment such a brave, faithful, and heroic young lad. where is he, anyway. spongebob: i'm up here.  patrick: i'm on it.  neptune: go to him now, krabs. embrace him.  mr. krabs: spongebob, me boy, i'm sorry i ever doubted ye. that's a mistake i won't make again. spongebob: oh, mr. krabs, you old softserve.  mr. krabs: and now, spongebob, i'm gonna do something that i should've done six days ago. mr. squidward. front and center, please.  i think we all know who rightfully deserves to wear that manager button.  squidward: i couldn't agree more, sir. harold: hooray for spongebob.  spongebob: wait a second, everybody. there's something i need to say first. i just don't know how to put it. squidward: i think i know what it is. after going on your lifechanging journey, you now realize you don't want what you thought you wanted. what you really wanted was inside you all along. spongebob: are you crazy.  i was just gonna say that your fly is down.  manager. this is the greatest day of my life.   captain: you know. david hasselhoff is a great artist. usher: excuse me, sir. you folks have to leave. captain: what. say that again, if you dare.  usher: you folks have to leave. captain: okay.  ) )
