welcome to a very important evening. tonight's event is entitled: pennies, for the pennyless. and before the following images are shown, i would ask each of you to look not look with your eyes, but with your heart.  three dimes, two nickels, one quarter, zero pennies. and since i realize the images seen here tonight may be wretchedly hideous, i am going to tell you what you can do to end this travesty: you can donate one penny to me: mr. krabs. also known as: mr. krabs, the man who doesn't have one.  spongebob: mr. krabs. mr. krabs:  yes. spongebob: i would like to donate a penny. mr. krabs: you would. spongebob: if i only had one.  mr. krabs: hiding it, somewhere. hiding it. hiding it. hiding it. hiding it. gary: meow. mr. krabs: what's that. you. you know where. gary: meow.  mr. krabs: tell where. gary: meow. mr. krabs: hiding it, inside,  in there, somewhere.  spongebob:  mr. krabs. what is this metal detector doing on the floor. these should only be stored on special racks.  and you're not wearing your metal detector handling gloves. mr. krabs: spongebob, i just wanted that penny you found on the street yesterday. oh, i'm sorry. spongebob: mr. krabs, that wasn't a penny.  mr. krabs: it wasn't. spongebob: no, that was just a dried up piece of gum for my collection. i think it's peppermint. mr. krabs: ah ha ha ha ha hooooooooo hoo. i fell so relieved. there was no penny after all. well, i'll be going now, you can keep the metal detector, spongebob. see ya. spongebob: thanks, mr. krabs. hey, gary, you can play with that.  hey, this isn't gum at all.  it's just a dumb old $500 bill. this won't go with my chewed up gum collection. ah well, good night, gary.  mr. krabs: penny, must have buried it around here somewhere. i'll just have to keep digging. ) )
