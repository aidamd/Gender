thought of her alone and afraid in jail makes me think about her being alone and afraid in jail. i don't know how she's going to survive.  mrs. puff: smelling the pretty roses.... haaapiness is just two kinds of ice creeeeam.  spongebob: oh, that poor woman. and it's all my fault. maybe if i go talk to patrick, he can ease my guilt.  patrick: well, it sounds like it's all your fault. spongebob: oh, you're right. mrs. puff's in jail and it's all because of me. i'm such a barnacle head.  poor mrs. puff. i know, i gotta get her out. but to get her out of jail, first we gotta get in jail. patrick: how are we gonna do that.  spongebob: alright, put the money in the bag.  put it in. bank teller: umm, you're facing the wrong way, sir. spongebob:  alright, give me the money. bank teller:

are showing a balance of $0.00 for both of your accounts. spongebob: oh. bank teller: next.  spongebob: well, that went better than expected. patrick: yeah. i didn't think we'd get mrs. puff out of jail this fast.  spongebob: don't worry, patrick, we'll get into jail this time.  fish: hey, there's a couple.  guard: put your back in it, girls.  spongebob: look, patrick, there she is.  mrs. puff, wait, it's us, spongebob and patrick. mrs. puff: that's funny. for a second, i thought that yellow rock talked to me. and its voice sounded a lot like... spongebob: spongebob. it's me, spongebob.  we're gonna bust you out of here. c'mon, mrs. puff.  mrs. puff: it's you. what are you doing here. why did you follow me in here. why..  guard #1: alright, mrs. puff, it seems like this heat's gone to your head. if you're gonna talk to rocks, i guess it's time for you to go on kitchen duty. mrs. puff: yes, it must be the heat. yes.  spongebob: darn it. ok, patrick, let's get out of here.  no, wait.  there goes our deposit on these costumes.  woman: hey there, puff mama. what's today's grub. mrs. puff: hi, donna. it's chili, same as always. let me get you some.  spongebob: mrs. puff, it's me, spongebob. mrs. puff: when are these horrific hallucinations going to end.  spongebob: no, it's really me.  i brought patrick along too. patrick: hi. mrs. puff: why. spongebob: 'cause we're gonna set you free. mrs. puff: no, i mean, why'd you bring him.  spongebob: he likes chili. now quick, get in before someone sees.  mrs. puff: spongebob, i am not going with you. spongebob:  that's a good one, mrs. puff. now hop in. come on. patrick: spongebob, i think she means it. spongebob: oh, that's crazy, patrick. mrs. puff: he's right, spongebob. i'm staying. spongebob: but why. mrs. puff: i like it here. these are my people.  and besides, if i'm in here, that means i won't have to deal with yooou...  ...uranium in the water supply.  see. crystal clear.  aahhhh. spongebob: excuse us for just one second, mrs. puff.  patrick, she has lost it. she's completely institutionalized. she's forgotten what it's like to live in the outside world. to not be in prison.  woman: coming to bed, honey. frankie billy: yes, dear.  spongebob: we've got to remind her that there is a life other than this. mrs. puff, if you come with us, i'll stay after school and decorate the whole classroom. mrs. puff: for the last time, no.  i'm not going with you and that's final.  oh.  guard #1: talking to inanimate objects again, huh, puff. get back to your cell. no more kitchen time for you.  spongebob: quick, mrs. puff, hop on. mrs. puff: guards. guards, come quick.  there's a crazed exstudent of mine and his overweight friend here to break me out. guard #1: that's just raw material used to make coat hangers. you need some rest.  spongebob: psst.  hop in, mrs. puff. mrs. puff: guards. guards, come look.  guard #1: whoa. they don't pay me enough to do this job.  spongebob: mrs. puff, up here. mrs. puff: guards, guards. they're back.  guard #1: what's all the hubbub, puff. mrs. puff: they're back.  spongebob & patrick: mrs. puff, it's us.  mrs. puff:  guard #1: what the barnacle is going on. mrs. puff: get away from me. get away. guard #1: what are you talking about, puff. mrs. puff: you can't fool me. you're spongebob and that guy who likes the chili.  guard #1: let's face it, puff, you've gone off the deep end.  get in there, you. you need a nice long stay in solitary confinement.  mrs. puff: oh well. let's look at the positives again. i'm finally away from those two. yes. all alone in my nice, soft room. spongebob: made of sponge.  officer malley: freeze. your joyride's over, punk.  mrs. puff: no. what.  spongebob: no. what are you doing. help. help.  no, no, please. i have a snail to feed. i can't go to jail now. this is not a good time. no, please, please. i'm not a criminal.  mrs. puff: i can't believe it. it was all a dream. i'm not going to jail. officer malley: why would you go to jail. you already did your time.  mrs. puff: oh, it's just my imagination again.  donna: so what's for dinner tonight, puff mama. chili.  mrs. puff: huh. what. huh. ah, forget it. ) )
