failed. if only we could just crawl up inside squidward and play him like a puppet. spongebob: that's it. we could crawl up inside squidward and play him like a puppet. patrick: oh, whose dumb idea was that. spongebob: yours. patrick: well, it sounds good to me. french narrator: later...  spongebob: okay, patrick, you go in first and control his arms and legs. then i'll go in and control the brain. patrick: okay.  patrick: eww.  it tickles. spongebob: how's that feel, buddy. patrick: not bad. okay, get on my shoulders.  spongebob: okay, patrick, i'm gonna see if i can make squidward talk.  spongebob:  my name is squidward, and i think spongebob is a lamebrain.  patrick:  wow, you sound more like him thanthan squidward.  spongebob: all right, patrick, we've got a date at the bikini bottom philharmonic. let's get going.  spongebob:  whoa, whoops. watch out. take it easy.  worker: hey. spongebob: left foot, right foot.  spongebob: whoa. excuse me. sorry.  spongebob: pardon me. officer rob: hey, twinkle toes, you're in a no dancing zone. now beat it.  spongebob: patrick, i just realized i don't know where the concert hall is.  spongebob: uh, let's ask someone.  spongebob:  excuse me, ma'am. i'm looking for the concert hall.  spongebob:  whoa. miss snell: young man, you don't need a concert hall. you need a hospital. handsome fish: great neptune, you're hideous.  i manage a freak show and you're exactly the kind of act i need. kid: mommy, look. it's frankenstein.  spongebob: oh, patrick. that bus is going to the concert hall.  spongebob: patrick, do you have any change. patrick: one second.  nat peterson: hey, i wasn't born yesterday. that'll be three fares.  nat peterson: hmm, what some people won't do to cheat the system.  french narrator: moments later...  maestro mackerel: and don't come back. musician: oh, man. that conductor's brutal.  spongebob and patrick: whoa.  spongebob:  i was just, oh, um,  the thing is not on the thing.  oh, uh... maestro mackerel: who is that imbecile. octavius rex: squidward tentacles. apparently he's a clarinet player.  maestro mackerel: all right, whenever you're ready. spongebob:  the clarinet, where's his clarinet. patrick: oh, i got it.  spongebob: ew, why'd you put it there. patrick: i guess i never actually thought of the moment where we'd have to play it. spongebob:  let's see, the ability to play clarinet has got to be in his brain somewhere. it's just a matter of squeezing it out.  maestro mackerel:  all right, thank you, next.  both: huh.  maestro mackerel: he's magnificent.  squidward: whatwhat's going on here. where am i. i'm at the audition. i'm playing, but i'm not in control. ii feel like i've been taken over by something. patrick: what's going on. spongebob: i don't know what's happening. i'm losing control. squidward:  must... gain... control. maestro mackerel: that's an unusual playing style, but still. he sounds magnificent. spongebob: patrick, i don't think i can command his brain much longer. patrick: me neither, spongebob.  squidward: what was thatspongebob. patrick. you're inside me.. oh, how did this happen. get out of my mind.  squidward: get out of my body. justjustjust get out.  both: tada. squidward: oh, i am going to lambaste you two. maestro mackerel: you're a wizard. a magical, musical wizard. squidward: ihuh. oh.  maestro mackerel: yes, yes. oh, bring us the ecstasy, maestro. squidward: i envy you common people. for you are about to have the glorious honor of hearing me play gustav mollusk's symphony no. 5 in c sharp minor. for i am in complete control.  french narrator: later...  ) )
