spongebob: you gotta help him. i think he's sick or something. me two: i feel funny.  spongebob: me two. me two. oh. what happened to him.. plankton: i was afraid of that. i thought i'd save some money by using cheap toner. spongebob: what does that mean. plankton: it means my plan is ruined. all the spongebob copies will fade away now. spongebob: fade away. all my brand new friends.. nooooooooo. they can't.  no. don't disappear.  plankton: quickly man. before you fade, what's the formula.. spongebob copy: it's easy. you take one par... i don't feel so good  plankton: wait no.

its... nice try, plankton. but i'm the o.s. the original sponge.  i can't believe they're all gone. plankton: you wouldn't want all those copies of you around. they were just imitations anyway. spongebob: hey, those imitations were my friends. plankton: one spongebob is more than the world can handle anyway. you're a unique snowflake. spongebob: yeah, thanks, plankton. things did get a bit out of hand with all those me's around. plankton: yeah, you're pretty annoying. well, you can stomp on me now if that's you want. spongebob: plankton, i'm a unique snowflake and snowflakes don't stomp. they skip  plankton: well, what do you know about that. no comeuppance. squidward: gaining speed, increasing thrust, raising nose, air pressure on tentacles, stray tables in right position, and liftoff. plankton: eh, spoke too soon. comeuppance in three. two...  ow. right on my keys.  ) )
