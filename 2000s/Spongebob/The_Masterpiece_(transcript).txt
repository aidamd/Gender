mr. krabs: it's comin' up on that time again. okay, boy, fire her up. spongebob: with pleasure, mr. krabs.  i love this part of the job. mr. krabs: don't forget the cheese. spongebob: and this part ain't bad either.  mr. krabs: looks good, kiddo. you want to do the honors. spongebob: you don't mean... mr. krabs: oh, i mean. spongebob:  thank you, mr. krabs. thank you. it is both an honor and a privilege that i shall mr. krabs: what are you going on about. i let you turn the sign every day.  spongebob: as i don the ceremonial white gloves, i can continue the eternal cycle and now deem the krusty krab...open.  patrons, spring forth.  the krusty krab will now seat you.  mr. krabs: all right, you landlubbers, get the lead neptune's jewels. where are all me costumers. and just when the krabby patty was about to go triple platinum. squidward. squidward. squidward. spongebob: no need to shout mr. krabs, he's right here, secretly watching his favorite soap, 'as the tide turns'. squidward: shut it spongebob. gil is about to reveal his secret. gil: you understand. them guppiesthem's my children. squidward: i knew it. mr. krabs: in case you two haven't noticed, we got no customers. and we're not gonna get 'em back if you two lazy susans sit around the tv all day. sea chicken: cockadoodleyum.  rise and shine. we're the best restaurant in the sea. mr. krabs: who dares lay claim to the title best restaurant in the sea. sea chicken: the sea chicken shack. announcer: say, mr. sea chicken, how's the flavor of that zesty sea chicken sandwich. sea chicken: it's impeckable.  so come on down to my sea chicken shack, and don't forget the kids.  mr. krabs: blimey, this is the first i've heard of this mr. sea chicken. there goes me monopoly. but how did he lure away me loyal customers away so fast. spongebob, i need you to head over to the sea chicken shack and see what's cookin'. spongebob: you want me to go undercover. mr. krabs: uh, that won't be necessary, boy. just look around, see how he's roping in all these customers. spongebob: understood, mr. krabs.  how do you like my new armpit spy cam, huh. huh. mr. krabs: spongebob, i don't need a spy. spongebob: oh, and check this outa special spy pen. looks just like a regular pen, right. see. see. see. see. see. see. just a pen, right. see. mr. krabs: right. spongebob: well, you'd be mistaken sir because this pen is also...a pencil. hmm. pretty sweet undercover spy stuff, huh, mr. krabs. mr. krabs: boy, stop this nonsense. spongebob: you're right, sir. who needs a spy pen when you are a master in the undercover arts. i blend in with the common man. then, like a whisper, i am gone.  yellow scrubber to big red. come in, big red. mr. krabs: just tell me what you see, spongebob. spongebob: i am inside. i repeat, i am inside. nothing of interest to report so far. in fact, it's kind of dumpy. and customer safety... a little lax.  and it smells in here like a tuna bathed in algae after running a marathon. fish #23: oh, so it's a crime now to exercise. mr. krabs: what about the food. spongebob: i have infiltrated the line right now, and i'll report back once i obtained sample. cashier: next. spongebob: one of your finest sandwiches, please. cashier: i'm afraid i can't do that, sir. please refer to our policy regarding dress. spongebob: "headbands equal no service." barnacles. my disguises' only weakness whoa. mayday, big red. contact has not been established. mission abort. mission abort.  yellow scrubber to big red, i was not able to obtain any intel. mr. krabs: cut the spy lingo and just tell me, is there anything remarkable about the sea chicken shack. spongebob: other than the faux dilapidation, not really. mr. krabs: what you're describin' is an absolute dump. are there any unique or interesting amenities that might attract me customers in any way. spongebob: no. great barrier reef. mr. krabs: what is it, lad. what do you see. spongebob: i see a huge statue depicting mr. sea chicken and all his glory.  mr. krabs: a statue. how does a statue steal me customers.  spongebob. spongebob.  of course, mr. sea chicken, you mad trickster, you, cater to the kids and the parents will foller.  boys, we don't have much time, so i'm gonna make this short and sweet. i need an artist, someone with a vision... squidward: oh, boy. mr. krabs: someone among us with a big talent... squidward: he's talking about me. mr. krabs: someone to create a glorious, towering statue of my likeness. you guys know anyone around here with an artistic bone in their body. spongebob: i do. mr. krabs: ooh, really. who. spongebob: guess. mr. krabs: um, larry the lobster. spongebob: no. mr. krabs: old man jenkins. spongebob: no. mr. krabs: 1tooth sally. spongebob:

doodlin' doodlydoo. squidward: for those who care, i am nothing short of an artistic genius. spongebob: word. squidward: unfortunately, that precludes me from doing any commercial pieces. goodbye. mr. krabs: hey, hey, now hold on, mr. squidward. you and i aren't that different from each other. we both "make product." squidward: are you suggesting the krabby patties are art. mr. krabs: yes. squidward, do you have any idea how many people come to the krusty krab every day. squidward: oh, i don't know, 12. mr. krabs: well, that's 12 more seeing your art than yesterday. squidward: all right, krabs, i'll do it. but i will need complete artistic control. mr. krabs: you got it, long as it's done by opening tomorrow. squidward: yes, tomtomorrow. mr. krabs: as advertised. squidward: i can't make a work for the ages overnight. art does not march to a ticking clock. art shall come when art is good and ready, sir. mr. krabs: if you want the public to experience your cultural input, get it ready by 8:00am. squidward: i'll need an assistant. mr. krabs: here you go.  squidward: fine. the first thing i need you to do, assistant, is get me a giant stone so that i may sculpt this masterpiece. spongebob: anything for the artiste. squidward: and don't dilly...  ...dally. nice rock. spongebob: isn't it. i can't believe no one was using it.  mr. krabs: i'm gonna be rich. squidward: i'm gonna be famous. spongebob: i'm gonna be squidward's assistant giant rock fetcher.  squidward: prepare to be immortalized in stone. mr. krabs: hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. what do you think you're doing. i'm...shy. squidward: i am posing you. did you think the sculpture was going to make itself.  don't you want the money this statue's going to bring in.  mr. krabs: like this. squidward:
