band: fired.. band member #2: but why. record producer: ask baldy mcbalderson over here. band: ned. band member #2: good going, dude. ned: i can't help it not having hair. band member #3: when we formed this band, it was for one reason and one reason only: to make a lot of money. and you not having hair is getting in the way of that. record producer: we are selling records, not denture cream.  either you come back with hair or don't come back at all.  mr. krabs:  time to go home, boys. spongebob:  almost finished.  see, squidward, it's functional, too. squidward: it's about as functional as your brain. spongebob:  thank you, squidward. squidward: that wasn't a compliment. the entire town is laughing at you. spongebob: i don't understand. squidward:  just look at yourself. spongebob: hello, handsome.  sss. squidward: spongebob, your head is twice as large as before. spongebob: hmmm, i've never been tall before. squidward: that wig is infested with parasites.  spongebob: that tickles. squidward: can't you see how ridiculous you look. spongebob: i think that it looks cool. mr. krabs: hahahaha. you wouldn't know cool if i locked you in the freezer.  spongebob: for your information, mr. krabs, squidward has locked me in the freezer, so i think i know what cool is. mr. krabs: well, stop wearing that nasty thing to work. spongebob: but mr. krabs... mr. krabs: no but's. spongebob: so i can't have a wig or a butt. mr. krabs: no, spongebob, it means until you get rid of that wig, get your butt out of here.  sandy: i never got a chance to talk to spongebob yesterday. i was laughing too hard.  spongebob. huh. spongebob: hi, sandy. what do you think. sandy: we need to talk.  spongebob: why would i want to get rid of my wig. look at how happy it makes everybody.  sandy: well, it does attract a lot of attention. spongebob: i know. people just can't keep their eyes off of me. sandy: neither can i, spongebob.  martha: it's true, john, this isn't my real hair. i stole it...  spongebob: oops. pardon me. excuse me. pardon me. pardon me.  and spongebob trips over it. spongebob gets his wig stuck in some cheese on the floor. get sunstuck but a soda is still in the wig] hey, the wig broke my fall.  mmm, popcorn.  ah, you always come through for me. dale:  hey buddy, do you mind. spongebob: shhh. it's very rude to talk during a movie.  sandy: umm, spongebob. spongebob:  you, too, sandy. people are trying to watch the movie. sandy: well, they can't. look, your stupid wig is blocking the whole screen.  fish #1: take it off, jerk.. fish #2: hey.. fish #3:

great idea. let's start a riot.  spongebob:  frank:  i told you that movie was terrible.  sandy: now do you see what i'm saying, spongebob. spongebob: i guess you're right, sandy. i got so much enjoyment out of the wig, myself, i assumed everyone else did, too. sandy: it's time to be strong. spongebob: i know.  i just want you to know that even though i didn't know you existed a few days ago, i can't imagine life without you. sandy: hurry up, spongebob. spongebob: no matter what they say, you'll always be cool to me.  i'll never accessorize again. sandy: you did the right thing, spongebob.  ned: where am i gonna get some hair. my career is ruined. ruined.  can it be. it is. my wig. yes. victory is mine. spongebob: wigs. wigs, wigs, they're everywhere. debbie: oh, he's got your hair. shubie: thank you. patrick:  spongebob. spongebob: patrick. at least he's not wearing a wig. patrick: look at my new wig.  spongebob: everyone's wearing wigs. everyone. i'm starting to feel a little betrayed. hey, you made fun of me yesterday. i thought powdered wigs were uncool. fish #1: yeah, they were. but look...  spongebob: wow. ned and the needlefish wearing my wig. so, i was cool before anyone else. fish #1: yes, you were. but not anymore. see ya.  spongebob: i wish i had a wig.  patrick: don't be sad, spongebob. you can borrow one of mine.  just wash it before you return it.
