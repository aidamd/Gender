mr. krabs: squidward. what do you think the nurse is doing to him in there. squidward: it's called a "checkup." it's an invasion of your personal space that's good for you.  nurse: sir, please hold

rough day. how'd ya like to chill out with a nice massage. it's free. mr. krabs:  free, huh. spongebob: free. mr. krabs: eh. okay. let's get this over with.  squidward: remember,  this is the coldblooded test. just take his temperature. spongebob: you got it, best friend. squidward: don't call me that. spongebob:  boop. squidward:  don't you do that.  mr. krabs: i'm ready. spongebob: all right, man, let's see if we can, like, work out some of this tension.  mr. krabs: why, youoh, no, no, no, no, no.   squidward: how's the coldblooded test going. spongebob: great. he's in the freezer right now. squidward: spongebob, you moron. coldblooded means your body is the same temperature as the water around it, not that you're actually cold.  mr. krabs: squidward. whyyyyyy. squidward: oh, mr. krabs, i'm so sorry. we had to give you your physical without you knowing, or the krusty krab would've been shut down, and i'd have to get a real job. spongebob: all right. final test. shell durability.  mr. krabs:  no, no, no, no, no, no.   mr. krabs:  now you see why i don't like checkups.  spongebob: don't worry, mr. krabs. yes, you failed every test today, but squidward and i will whip you into shape, even if it takes the rest of the weekend.  spongebob: let's kick it up a notch.   mr. krabs: whoano.  mr. krabs:  ohohnooh, jeezohh.  spongebob: i don't know what we did wrong, squidward. mr. krabs looks worse than before.  squidward: i guess that nurse is gonna close the krusty krab after all. i wish i could say it's been a pleasure working with you. spongebob: oh, squidward, i'll miss you too.  mr. krabs: quit yer blubberin', boy. me body may be mush, but me mind's sharp as a tack. and i...have a plan.  nurse: good morning. i assume your boss passed his physical. squidward: oh, um...yes. of course he did. um, unfortunately, our results were spongebob: uh, eaten. squidward:  yeah, yeah. um, anyway, we thought you could give old mr. k another exam yourself. he's in his office. nurse: hmm...very well.  nurse: mr. krabs...not only did you pass your exam, you might be the most astonishingly excellent physical specimen i've ever seen.  spongebob and squidward: whew. larry:  my name is mr. krabs, and i love money. nurse: yes. you said so several times during the examination.  nurse: i suppose i won't need to close your restaurant today. see you next year.  mr. krabs:  whoohoo. we did it, boys. the krusty krab lives to see another day. three cheers for a successful ruse. spongebob: let's just make it one. spongebob and mr. krabs: hip, hip, hooray. larry:  so, you said there would be some money in this for me.  mr. krabs: you'll never get me money.  ) )
