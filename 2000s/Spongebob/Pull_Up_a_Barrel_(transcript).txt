mr. krabs: nope. nothing.  i can't smell a cent or a dollar. or any money in a 5mile radius. we might as well settle down early.  just as soon as that guy finishes his meal. squidward: you mean the guy who's been nursing a single fry for the last hour. mr. krabs: when he goes, you can go.  squidward: grr.  excuse me, sir. but you seem to be having trouble masticating. here let me help you.  what. no tip. finally. yes.  leaving early. i can't believe this is finally happening.  cause it's not. mr. krabs: oh my. that's quite a storm. you know, a storm like this puts me in the mind of me old navy days. spongebob: old navy days.. ohh. mr. krabs: that gives me a fine idea, spongebob. since it looks we're gonna be stuck here for a while, why don't you pull up a barrel, me laddies. while i retell you a thrillin' tale of me mysterious salty past.  there, now. the lights are properly dimmed.  feast yourself on these slightly expired soda crackies  as i explain ya the yarn that puts hair on your chest. squidward: i don't want any hair on my chest. spongebob: ooh, i do.  mr. krabs: it was a day just like this one. the wind was howling.  and me ship was being tossed about, like a rag doll on a trampoline.  i was in the galley. cooking up grub for me crew to keep their mind off this horrible squall.  it was just then that he bursts into the galley. spongebob: who he. mr. krabs: the man whose mission was to make my life a living nightmare.  the roughest, toughest, scaliest old barnacle that ever roamed the briny deep. he was me commandin' officer and he loathe me with the white, hot hatred of a psychotic madman.  they called him,  captain scarfish. captain scarfish: hello. spongebob: ahh.  captain scarfish: stand at attention, mr. krabs.  i want you to tell me the meaning of this.  mr. krabs: oh, that sir. why sir, that's a seacucumber sandwich, sir, with the crusts cut off, sir. a little booshieamusie for the boys, sir.  captain scarfish: this is the navy, son. we don't cut the crusts off. we eat the crusts and throw the rest away.  mr. krabs: but that's... that's madness.  captain scarfish: i'm telling you for the last time. you're gonna have to stop making your food so delicious. mr. krabs: but i don't know how. captain scarfish: well, you better figure it out. i need my men  wideeyed and hungry, krabs. we've got a cargohold full of suntan lotion. and...  squidward: wait, you were transporting suntan lotion.  what spf.  mr. krabs: i don't see what's so amusing about that, mr. squidward. we were a cargo ship  heading straight into pirate territory with a fresh supply of suntan lotion for shipwreck sailors whose skin was chafed.  chafed, mr. squidward. spongebob: chafed.  captain scarfish: chafed. mr. krabs: aye, sir. i understand, sir. chafed. captain scarfish: so, tonight's meal is gonna be terrible. you understand, me.. mr. krabs: aye, sir. captain scarfish: the worst you've ever made. mr. krabs: ayeaye, sir. captain scarfish:  the kind of slop that will put some steel in their spines. mr. krabs: ayeaye, sir. captain scarfish: either that or i'll throw you in the brig.  mr. krabs: yes, sir.  crew: huzzah. mr. krabs: oh, don't "huzzah" yet, boys. lou: what's on the menu tonight, eh. mr. krabs: slop.  lou: oh, slop, eh. good one. why don't you put some of that delicious slop right here on my...  oh. i bet it's one of those things that looks bad, but it tastes really...  bad. mr. krabs: oh, sorry boys.  captain's orders.  oh, i can't stand it.  i don't care what the captain says.  crew:  huzzah. huzzah for mr. krabs. huzzah.  captain scarfish: what's all this "huzzahing" about.. mr. krabs: oh, nothing sir. uh, they just really enjoy eating slop. don't you, boys.  captain scarfish: attention.  looks like slop alright. but what's this.  mr. krabs: cherries jubilee. crew: cherries jubilee. captain scarfish: cherries jubilee.. mr. krabs: well, flaming cherries jubilee. captain scarfish: flaming.. what are you trying to pull, you lubber. this looks like regular cherries jubilee. mr. krabs: well, you see, sir, i was just gonna take this here match and...  and so, i found meself in the brig with two guards watching me every move.  the one was as brutal and ugly a bounder as you ever wish to see in your darkest nightmare.  octopus sailor: grr, what are you looking at.  mr. krabs: but i thought i could dupe the other one sure than need a rise.  spongebob: gee, mr. krabs. that second guard sounds like a real goofball. mr. krabs: i managed to worm some useful information out of him right away. you see, he was an aspiring cook and i talked him into seeking some things down into the brig for me. the tombs of me trade you might say.  i set him to work on a spongesugared cathedral that took up most of his attention.  he never suspected that i was using the scraps to fashion a candykey. where's your sourpuss friend tonight. ensign: sick in bed like all the men. the captain's been feeding them nothing but moldy, old sandwich crusts.  they've all got terrible bellyaches. but not me, though. i cook for myself. mr. krabs: wise lad.  and so, after a few hours of bouncing off the walls, the sugar finally wore off.  and soon, he was napping like a baby. this was me chance to use me sweet key to freedom.  but did i dare take it. i'd be in violation of the naval code. then something happened that made me mind up for me.  pirates. we were under attack.  i had to act fast.  wake up, lad. wake up. man your battle stations.  i was on me own.  i could see it all. a pirate ship. and on that island: a crew of five naval men. our only hope, marooned on a beach by those same scurvy pirates.  and suffered from the effects of chafe. sunburn.  the pirates had already launched a boat and were preparing to board our vessel. pirate captain: row, you worthless dogs. captain scarfish:  stand down, krabs. i'll have you on irons.  mr. krabs: listen to me, captain. this is gonna get real ugly real fast. we've got to get to the cannons. captain scarfish: we're not outfitted for battle, krabs. there's no ammunition. the cannons are ornamental at best.  ornamental at best. mr. krabs: then listen carefully. we'll have to go down to the cargohold and poke holes in the barrels of suntan lotion and scuttle the ship. captain scarfish: what you're suggesting is mutiny.  ensign: do as he says, captain. mr. krabs: what are you using for ammo there, ensign. ensign: oh, i rolled up an old, moldy sandwich crust into a hard, little ball.  mr. krabs:  that's it.  come with me, lad.  direct hit. mr. krabs and ensign: huzzah.  pirate captain: you'll pay for that. get 'em boys.  ensign: uh, what do i do. mr. krabs: get down to the cargohold and check on the captain.  charge. hup. hey. whoop. whoa. hiyah. woo.  close one. haha.  pirate captain: aww, he's kinda handsome for a crusty old cuss. captain scarfish:  i can't do it. i'm weak. ensign: snap out of it, man.  eeww. captain scarfish: my personality.  ensign: oh, uh, let me put that back.  naval fish: oh my. this feels wonderful. yes, it feels great.  mr. krabs:  hoo. whoo. haha. whoop. missed me.  uhoh. uh, anyone for cherries jubilee. pirate captain: finish him off.  naval fish: huzzah for mr. krabs. mr. krabs: haha. the sunburn brigade.  haha. me plan worked. hehhehhehhehhehheh. pirate captain: handsome and clever, i see.  join me, krabs. we'll rule the seven seas together. mr. krabs: i can't let you go, lass. that'll be violation of the naval code. enjoy your last meal. i hope you like spongesugar.  pirate captain: huh.  oh.  squidward: what are we all winking about. spongebob: i don't know.  ) )
