spongebob: patrick. tee time, patrick. patrick.  tee time, patrick.  patrick. wake up. patrick:  ready to lose. weather permitting, of course.  spongebob: aw, how are we supposed to golf in this this downpour. our putters are getting waterlogged.  patrick: dumb rain. doesn't anybody know i'm the sheriff in these parts.  hey, rain. you better stop that.  patrick:  aaaaaahhh..... squidward:  if you two don't mind, could you keep it down to a low rumble. spongebob and patrick: sorry, squidward. spongebob: i guess we were just too upset about the rain and how... squidward: don't care.  spongebob:  i was really looking forward to a day of sportsmanship and male bonding. thanks a lot, rain.  hey,  that gives me an idea.  man with french accent: what follows is a brief construction montage.  man with french accent: we hope you enjoyed this brief construction montage.  squidward:  hey. hello.. nitwit, morons. spongebob: oh, hi, squidward. up from your slumber, i see. well, you're just in time to endure in a friendly game of  indoor miniature golf. squidward: i will not indulge in anything friendly or otherwise with the likes of you two. presently, i am heading to enjoy a welldeserved morning nap. patrick: but we sculpted your likeness out of butter on hole five.  squidward: i don't care. listen up, i will not be woken from my nap again, and if i am, i'm gonna... patrick: join us on the back nine. squidward: just don't let it happen again. or else.  spongebob: let's get this game teed off.  you're up first, my good man.  squidward: would you two keep it down.. spongebob: better tone down the calisthenics, patrick. don't wanna upset squidward. patrick: can't wait to lose, huh.  no. ooh. if you would just let me finish my stretches, i wouldn't have missed my first shot. spongebob: oh, don't worry, patrick, i'm sure you'll get the hang of it.  besides, we're just playin' for fun, right. and back, and patrick: nice shot.  spongebob: what are you doing. patrick: moving my ball. spongebob: patrick, you have to play it where it lands. patrick: fine. have it your way.  ready to give up.  patrick: ha. let's see how you do against the windmill. you haven't got a chance. spongebob: you know, patrick, this is just a game. patrick: oh, it is just a game, which i am gonna win. spongebob: i think you're missing the point.  patrick: speaking of mmmissing.  ha. gotta play it where it lands. watch and learn, squarepants. watch and learn.  yes. see if you can top that. spongebob:  okay. patrick:  spongebob readies the approach shot. he's gotta be very careful he doesn't hook the shot here, because this would certainly be an inopportune time for a bogey.  a pressurepacked shot to be sure.   bikini bottomites: aw.   patrick: looks like we're tied, three shots to three. spongebob: shots.  they're called strokes in golf, patrick. not shots. patrick: whatever.  and he sinks another hole in one. that's two in a row. spongebob: all right. you wanna play competitive, eh. observe.  right between the old wickets. come on bally, don't fail me now. patrick: watch out for the water hazard. spongebob: patrick, the only hazard i can see is you standing in my shot. patrick: i have no idea what you're talking about. spongebob: fine. be that way. i'll just go around you.  oops. patrick: showoff. i can do that.  spongebob: oh, where did our balls go. patrick: well, how do i know. i was just copying you. spongebob:  uhoh. oh well, i guess that's game point. patrick: ohhohohoho, hold on there, fella. it's not over yet. spongebob: but remember what squidward said. we can't make any noise. patrick: who said anything about noise. we're just gonna get outta the rough and back to the course. spongebob: hey. patrick. patrick. what's the big idea. i thought we were in here to play golf, remember. patrick: okay, okay. spongebob: now where is that darn ball. patrick: oh. spongebob: patrick, have you seen by ball. patrick: was it a red one. spongebob: mhmm. patrick: it might have been in the kelp salad. spongebob: patrick, you ate my ball. patrick: don't worry, i'll get it. spongebob: patrick, no. patrick: no. spongebob: i have to play the ball where it lies.  you'll need to leave this open.  now, let's see, if i was a golf ball, where would ioh. next to the gallbladder, of course. fore.  where's your ball. patrick: i don't know. gotta be around here somewhere.  spongebob: there it is. patrick: uhoh. spongebob: play it where it lies. patrick:  hole in one. top that. spongebob: i could do that blindfolded.   patrick: wait up. warmer. warmer. red hot. spongebob:  aha. patrick: warmer. warmer. colder. colder. warmer. warmer. warmer. hot. hotter. red hot. red hot.  wait, my mistake. you're right. oh, warmer. warmer. hot. hot. red hot. red hot. spongebob, red hot.  wrong again. spongebob: patrick...  patrick: stop peeking. hotter.  hotter. hot. hot. cold. hot. cold. hot. cold. spongebob: patrick. this is ridic ulous. wow. squidward's really

spongebob:  play it where it lies. patrick: play it where it lies. spongebob: but how are we gonna hit our balls back to my house from here. patrick: all it takes is a little finesse, spongebob. all it takes is a little finesse. spongebob: okay, you're good to go. patrick: fore.  it's all yours. spongebob: this one's for all the marbles. patrick: but i thought we weren't betting. spongebob: no, i mean whoever wins this hole wins the game.  squidward:  what's going on here.   spongebob and patrick: hole in one.  spongebob: good morning. patrick: sorry we woke you. squidward:  whawhat.  spongebob: hey, squidward, what happened to your dentures.  patrick: good game, pal. spongebob: rematch next saturday. patrick: rain or shine, spongebob. rain or shine.  squidward:  spongebob.. ) )
