squidward: ladies and gentlemen, behold my wondrous paintings.  tom: um, excuse me, can i have some ketchup. squidward: hey, look at my arts you dummy..  mr. krabs:  i don't know how you talked me into this art show, spongebob, but i'm shutting this thing down right now.  spongebob: aw, you can't, mr. krabs. wait until squidward sells some of his paintings. squidward: buy some important paintings. see me expose my exquisite suffering.  squidward: hmph. these fools don't even recognize the masterworks in front of their faces. i'll confront them with the power of my art.  squidward: witness the beauty.  larry: come on, larry. get your salad on. squidward: come on, larry. get your art on.  larry:  oh. my eyes. ahh.  the pain.   orchid's son: i want a krabby meal. squidward:  how about some art to go with that.  orchid's son: ahh.. orchid:  run, baby, run.  mr. krabs: that's it. squidward is scaring me customers away. i'm shuttin' this art show down. he's never gonna sell his paintings. spongebob: sure he will.  i just bought one. mr. krabs:  holy shrimp. why would you do that to yourself. spongebob: what do you mean. i love it.  spongebob: mr. krabs, squidward is our friend and his paintings are so cheap, you should buy one just to be nice. customer:  i'm good. mr. krabs: nice. nice. i don't waste my money on nice. spongebob: but think about how valuable these paintings might become. mr. krabs: valuable. what do you mean. spongebob: when art gets older,  it usually gets more expensive.  squidward's paintings might be worth millions someday. mr. krabs: millions..  out of me way. here.  gimme.  give it here. this is mine now. spongebob: okay, mr. krabs. mr. krabs:  now, all i need to do is sit back and watch me art grow more valuable.  art appraiser: i am a very important art appraiser and i say this socalled art will never be worth a penny. mr. krabs: hey, eugene h. krabs does not i'll lose money. there must be something i can do to make this art worth lots more cash. art appraiser:  hmm... squidward: i sold all my art. this tiny handful of coins has legitimized me.  who wants the autograph of a real artiste.  art appraiser: well, paintings can become much more valuable when the artist is no longer with us. you know. out of the picture.  mr. krabs: out of the picture, eh. i think i can arrange this.  squidward: artist walking. check me out. mr. krabs: check this out.  i have a delivery for ya, mr. squidward. squidward: what. you can't be serious. an artist such as myself should not be subject to such menial tasks. spongebob: aw, don't be menial to squidward, mr. krabs. i'll take the delivery. mr. krabs: no, mr. squidward is a real artist now and real artists can handle anything.  squidward: the arctic is so cold.  come on, squidward. you're a strong artist. you can do it.  no.  squidward:  spongebob. spongebob:  oh, hi, squidward. squidward:  spongebob, what are you doing here. spongebob: just getting some ice.  fresh.  need some help.  whoa.  squidward: here's your food.  arctic sperm whale: hey, this is cold. perfect.  spongebob: eeh, we'd better get you home.  mr. krabs: hello, is this the art appraiser. just wanted to let you know that me good, good friend, squidward, is now "out of the pict"  whwhwhwhat the seahorse..  got another delivery for you, squidward.  and only squidward. spongebob: your eyes are so pretty.  bus driver: next  stop,  rock  bottom.   squidward:  "237 rock bottom." oh, there it is. oh, remember, squidward, real artists embrace the unknown.  uh, is anyone here.  i've got a delivery from the krusty  krab.  squidward: ahh. spongebob:  what are we screaming about. squidward: monsters. spongebob: oh, they're not monsters, squidward. they're my friends. angler fish: what's  up,  spongebob. ha.   mr. krabs:  yes, i'm sure that mr. squidward is out of the picture for good. he will be missed. so, come on over and tell old krabs how much money me paintings are worth.   mr. krabs: ha, ha, ha, hehe, ha.  squidward, delivery.   spongebob: ha, this tickles.  mr. krabs: follow me, mr. squidward. i've got a special delivery vehicle just for a great artist like yourself. squidward: well, that's more like it. finally, some respect. mr. krabs: into the rocket ya go.  squidward: wait. why do i need a rocket. where is this delivery to. mr. krabs: mars.  squidward: oh, mars. well, the...mmmmmmars.. spongebob: bye, squidward.  squidward: delivery from the krusty krab.  martian: mmm. yummy, yummy.   squidward: hmph. all this red. so garish. ha, this dump needs a true artist touch. martians: huh.  mr. krabs: so, now that squidward definitely 100% is gone for good, what a shame, what do you think of these here paintings. art appraiser: well, of course they're awful, but if the socalled artist is really out of the picture, then perhaps they're worth something. mr. krabs: really.  oh, it's so complicated. these are tears of joy, but they're also tears of sadness for my good friend, squidward. wherever he is. spongebob: oh, here he is, mr. krabs.  mr. krabs: stay here and keep an eye on me investments.   squidward:  well, that was disgusting. so, who wants to talk about my use of color and brush stroke.  art appraiser: ahem.  hmph. mr. krabs: i have done everything i could to get you away from here safely and now you're messing with me money.  spongebob: run, squidward, run. mr. krabs: hey. how about a little support here. spongebob: run, mr. krabs, run.  spongebob: but a little slower than squidward. french narrator: 3 hours later...  spongebob: psst, it's your best friend, spongebob.  squidward: oh, get off of me. spongebob: i'll never get off of you, squidward. not until you're safe. squidward: i'll never be safe.  not until my paintings are gone. spongebob: no, squidward. you can't deprive the world of your paintings. squidward: true, but it's better than depriving the world of me.  spongebob: come on, squidward. destroy those paintings before mr. krabs gets back.  squidward: i...i can't do it. they're just too magnificent. mr. krabs: hey, hey, hey. get away from me paintings. squidward: oh, i'm sorry, paintings, but it's you or me.  art appraiser: yes, yes. now, this is true art. squidward: what. really. art appraiser: so visceral. so dangerous. squidward: yes, feel my art.  mr. krabs:  leave me paintings alone, you monster. art appraiser: no. that was the most accelerating performance art i have ever seen. mr. krabs: really. so, it must be worth millions. hey, out of me way.  spongebob:  mr. krabs, uh, squidward, ii don't think you should be doing that. squidward: oh, don't be so provincial, spongebob. mr. krabs: yeah, stop trying to censor our money. i mean our art.  art appraiser:  bravo. bravo. bravo.  mr. krabs: whoo, boy. hee, hee. so, how much ya gonna give me for all this. ha, ha. art appraiser: nothing. performance art is about the moment. you cannot put a price on it.  mr. krabs: what. wait, come back here, you doublecrossin'  spongebob: d'oh. mr. krabs. squidward.  art appraiser: ahha.  art appraiser: and that is how i acquired this masterpiece.  squidward: i'm an artist. mr. krabs: i'm rich. spongebob: and i helped.  ) )
