restaurant chain, but it's the blood, sweat, and tears of a hard days work. it's not about the mon...  holy sweet mother of pearl. i like the way you think blandy. but it's gonna take a lot more than a suitcase of cash to buy the krusty krab from me. howard: oh, there's a lot more than that. the rest is over there.  mr. krabs: jumpin' king neptune.  sold. can i have my money. howard: just one thing. if you can sign this contract. it just states that you relinquish the krusty krab and all proprietary ownership thereof. along with its employees, merchandise, logos, and cash registers. mr.

krabby o' mondays. squidward: sincere service with a smile. carl: well, yes, but with the krabby o' mondays spirit. now, squidward, you wouldn't want to have to talk to human resources...  ...would you. so, what's our motto again. squidward: sincere service  with a smile.  carl: now you're gettin' it. mr. krabs:  morning, spongebob. spongebob: mr. krabs. what are you doing here. mr. krabs: retirement ain't all it's cracked up to be. so, i'm the new bus boy.  uhh, ok son, you're starting to creep my out. spongebob:  i knew you'd come back, mr. krabs, i just knew you would. mr. krabs: ok, boy, back to work. spongebob: aye aye, sir. mr. krabs: i'm not your boss anymore. just call me eugene. spongebob: aye aye...eugene.  mr. krabs: ahoy, squidward. squidward: ahoy, eugene. would you mind clearing this table for me. mr. krabs: sure, squidward. ya know, i've never seen you this happy. squidward: they're watching us. mr. krabs: that guy's a real pain in the hindquarters, eh squiddy. squidward: uhh, eugene, i think you need to look at page 20 of our employee handbook again. mr. krabs: oh, i don't need carl's silly rules. squidward: i really think you should look.  mr. krabs: what's this. help me. carl: hey, fellas, what's going on over here. squidward: oh, hey carl, uhh, i was just reminding eugene about article 24 section 3 of our employee handbook. carl: cut the chatter, and pick up the platter. great job, squidward. mr. krabs: what have you done to real squidward. carl: the less you know, eugene, the better. mr. krabs: what's going on around here. where's spongebob.  spongebob:  where's the love. mr. krabs: spongebob, what happened to the krabby patties. spongebob: i tried to tell them... but they wouldn't listen to me. mr. krabs: this is obscene.  carl, i need to have a wor... cash register: your change is $1.75. mr. krabs: automated cash register. noo.  hey, carl, what have you done to me restaurant. processed krabby patties. computerized registers. carl: look around you. our customers are quite content with the contrived and the mediocre.  mr. krabs: that's because they don't know what they're eating.  excuse me, ma'am, do you know what's in that patty you're eating. customer: no.  mr. krabs: see that, without all your smoke & mirrors, no one would stomach this garbage. edward: what'd he say. garbage.  carl: eugene, you're in violation of your contract. mr. krabs: rules. here's a rule for ya: people can't eat stain glass barstools.  i'll show you automated.  carl: mr. blandy. code red. free thinker. howard: mr. krabs, is there a problem here. mr. krabs: you better believe there's a problem. i used to kiss the ground you walked on, blandy. but after seeing this, i wouldn't even spit in your direction. krabby patties are supposed to be made by hand, one at a time. not on a conveyor belt.  carl: oh, my.  does this mean i won't get that raise, sir. howard:  it's ruined. friend: we'll have to sell it. we'll be lucky if we get a fraction of what we paid for it.  mr. krabs: i'll buy it for full price. friend: sold. we won't be needing your contract anymore.  nice doing business with you. mr. krabs: pleasure's all mine. now get out of me restaurant.  we did it, boys.  the krusty krab is ours again. ya know, in a fit of maniacal rage, i may have destroyed the restaurant, scared away all our customers, and forced us into bankruptcy because i returned nearly every penny i sold this stink heap for, but it was all worth it. and i got back the love of my dear friends. squidward: really, mr. krabs. mr. krabs: no, not really. get back to work.  ) )
