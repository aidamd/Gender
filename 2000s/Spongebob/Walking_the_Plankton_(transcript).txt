as mine. ha ha ha. what in seabottoms.. mr. krabs:  now look here, boy. i'm bringing along the secret formuler as a precaution, just in case our absence proves to temptin' to a certain oneeyed creepycrawly. plankton: well played, krabs, well played indeed. but, as usual, this oneeyed creepycrawly is one step ahead of you.  you can't beat plan b, you can't beat it. ah, this is going to be so sweet. karen, we are going on a luxury cruise. karen the computer: a cruise, just the two of us.. oh, plankton.  hey, if this is another scheme to steal the secret formula, you can leave me home. plankton: no, of course not.  just think of it as our second honeymoon. karen: don't you have to have a first honeymoon before you embark on a second. plankton: why don't i bump those vacation settings up a smidge.  karen: oh, plankton, this second honeymoon is gonna be so great. plankton:  yeah, it's going to be groovy, babe. now a quick check of the vacation inventory. suntan lotion,

and soaking up the rays. karen: oh, i hope i don't get screen burn. plankton: let me give you a hand with that, honey.  karen: oh, plankton, you're such a sweet husband when you aren't obsessing over

how anyone can stand this slop. it makes me miss our grub over back at the krusty krab. spongebob, be a good manservant and fix me up a krabby patty, would ya. spongebob: a good fry cook is never far from his grill, sir.  sadie rechid: what is that delicious smell. fred rechid: i don't know, but i want it, whatever it is. spongebob: order up, mr. krabs.  mr. krabs: he he hey. looks like we have a
