mr. krabs:  rev your excitement engines, mr. squidward.  do you not know what tomorrow is. squidward: another monotonous day i spend walking in slow motion towards an empty horizon. mr. krabs: no, that's today. tomorrow is food con. spongebob:  whoo. food con. wait, what's a food con. squidward: additionally, who cares. mr. krabs: mr. squidward. food con is the biggest convention of food fans in the entire ocean.  the best chefs and cooks gather together and compete for the top prize: the goldencornucopia.  spongebob: oh boy. the krabby patty is a sure bet to win the golden cornucopia. mr. krabs: you darn tootin' it is. and you two will be me right claw men. eh, could use some extra muscle to set up the booth.  perfect. let's hit the road.  mr. krabs: as you can see gentlemen, i have spared no expense on our transportation.  spongebob, patrick, and squidward: whoa.  mr. krabs: ta da. spongebob: woo. patrick: what a ride. squidward:  mr. krabs:  and i brought plenty of free samples to sell. spongebob: this is the best day ever. spongebob and patrick: road trip.  spongebob:  i spy with my little eye... patrick: mr. krabs. spongebob: yes. patrick:  i spy with my little eye...  spongebob: mr. krabs. patrick: oh ho. yes. yes.  spongebob: i spy with my little eye... patrick: mr. krabs. spongebob: oh, how did you know. mr. krabs:  enough.. you both are barnacles on me brain. spongebob and patrick:  whoa. look at that. spongebob: the world's second biggest lump is only 50 miles away. we gotta see it. squidward and mr. krabs: no. patrick: the world's least exciting sweater. my parents fell in love there. we gotta go. squidward and mr. krabs: no. spongebob and patrick: cool toilet. squidward and mr. krabs: no. mr. krabs: we are not stoppin' 'til we get to food con.  spongebob: hey.  patrick: hey.  squidward: grr.. for the last time, we get it. trucks have horns. spongebob: come on, squidward. give it a try. squidward: if i do, will you promise to stop. spongebob and patrick: yes. squidward: alright. hey.  squidward: typical. patrick: you did it wrong, squidward. squidward:  i did it exactly the way you did it. mr. krabs:  everybody pipe down... i don't wanna hear another peep from anyone until we get to food con. spongebob: peep. mr. krabs: not a peep. spongebob: peep. mr. krabs: not a peep. spongebob: peep.  everyone: peep's cliff...   everyone: whew.  spongebob: mr. krabs.  blink if you're alive.  spongebob: whew. thank neptune, we're ok. squidward: well, at least we have plenty of food while we're stuck out here.  patrick:  it was an accident that it fell into my mouth.  spongebob: don't worry, guys. we can still win food con. there's one patty left. mr. krabs: we gotta get movin'. the judgin' starts tomorrow. now, since you boys caused the accident, you'll be haulin' the trailer.  spongebob and patrick: yeah. haulin' the trailer.  french narrator: and so, spongebob and patrick begin their narrowing task.  tell it to the wagon, not just by ropes, but by their own foolish mistakes. onward, they trench.  french narrator: pushed by mr. krabs, whose desires blind him to the pain he influenced. in short, this whole trip is beginning to look like a whoopsie.  spongebob: patrick, are you ok.  patrick: 100%.  squidward: mr. krabs, we've got to stop for the night if you want spongebob and patrick to live. i'm not saying that's what i want, i'm just telling you the facts.  spongebob: we must guard this last patty with our very lives. it's the only way to win food con. and who knows what scary, hungry things are out there in the woods waiting to gobble it up.  spongebob: positions everyone.  spongebob: aww. hey, little fella.  everyone: the patty.  spongebob: oh, what are we gonna do.. mr. krabs: don't eat my patty.  spongebob: squidward, you've saved the krabby patty. squidward: whoopee.  mr. krabs: maybe i could just eat a pickle. squidward: maybe i could just eat the corner of the lettuce. patrick: i don't wanna be a hog. i'll just eat what's leftover.  spongebob: no, we can't do that. i know we're all hungry, but we must stay focused. remember food con. remember the cornucopia. mr. krabs:  he says "food con". but all i hear is "food".  patrick: hey, spongebob. you look tired. you want me to guard the patty for a bit. spongebob:  thanks, patrick. that'll be great.  spongebob: patrick, no. patrick: i can't believe you thought i would eat it. spongebob: patrick, i'm sorry i doubted you. i'm just hungry and tired and i feel like i'm all alone doing the right thing and i...  spongebob: hey. patrick: but i'm hungry.  patrick: ow.   squidward: i'll lure him to sleep with a lovely lullaby. mr. krabs: ooh, good idea. music soothes the savage beast.  squidward: what the.  mr. krabs: did i say "soothe". i guess i meant enrages.  squidward: everybody's a critic.  mr. krabs: hey there, boyoh. i've taken the liberty of creatin' a safe to secure our precious patty. spongebob: great idea, mr. krabs. mr. krabs:  just put in right in here. i'll even step away while you do it.  spongebob: pew, it smells really bad in there. mr. krabs: ok, just do it already.  spongebob: no.  mr. krabs: enough of this. i am your boss and i order you to give me that patty. spongebob: no, mr. krabs. i will not. but i will give you these.  spongebob: nature patties. patrick: oh boy. squidward: how delightful. mr. krabs: dig in, boys.  squidward: oh. it's like eating the inside of a lawn mower. mr. krabs: i think mine is mostly stones. spongebob:  out here, we call them forest tomatoes.  mr. krabs: enough of this.  spongebob: mr. krabs, remember food con. mr. krabs: you can't win food con if you starve to death. now, give me that krabby patty boyoh. spongebob: no. i'm doing this for your own good. i'm protecting you all from yourselves. mr. krabs: well, in that case, you leave me no choice. get him... spongebob: yeow..  patrick: hunger.  krabby patty: hey. psst. it's me. the patty. spongebob: oh, hi. krabby patty: it's just me and you out here, now. so, just do it. eat me. spongebob: what about food con. krabby patty:  oh, forget food con. you're starving and i'm right here.  spongebob: maybe you're right. krabby patty: of course, i'm right. i'm a talking sandwich. spongebob:  yes, a sandwich has no reason to lie.  spongebob:  no. i made a vow. i will not eat you. mr. krabs:  shh. shh. i hear him over there. he's arguing with the patty. get him.  mr. krabs: don't let him get away.  spongebob: what.  food con.  mr. krabs: get him. spongebob: guys, we're here.  mr.
