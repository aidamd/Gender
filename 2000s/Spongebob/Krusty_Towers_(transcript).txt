spongebob: so, i was all ready to drain the fries, but i cooked the fries slightly too long. so... squidward: spongebob. spongebob: so, here's where the bizarre twist comes in. squidward: spongebob. spongebob: they weren't overcooked at all. squidward: spongebob, look.  spongebob: wow, what happened to the krusty krab. mr. krabs: good morning. the krusty towers is now opened for business. spongebob: why did you build a hotel, mr. krabs. mr. krabs: i'm glad you asked, son. remember when i went to that fast food convention and stayed in that fancy hotel. i had a beautiful room. the employees were so friendly. they catered to me every whim, no matter how demeaning it was. because they lived by a code. and that code was engraved in fine gold above the grand fireplace: "we shall never deny a guest even the most ridiculous request". everything was perfect until i got the bill. they charged me for everything. $25 for a hamburger.  if they can charge that much for a lousy burger, imagine how much i could charge for a lousy krabby patty. and thus, the krusty towers was born. squidward: why would anyone stay in a hotel in bikini bottom. it's in the middle of scenic nowhere. there's nothing to do but get stung by jellyfish.  see. spongebob:  ooh. mr. krabs: come inside.  isn't it beautiful. squidward: where are all the new hotel employees.  mr. krabs: my first hotel guest. watch me reel him in.  welcome to the krusty towers, where our motto is "we shall never deny a guest even the most ridiculous request". dave: oh, that's great. i'd like a double krabby patty with no onions and extra pickles. mr. krabs: if you want a krabby patty, you'll have to rent a room and order room service. dave:  ooh, i've only got an hour for lunch.  squidward: boy, you reeled that one in like a pro. mr. krabs: ok, squidward, you man the front desk. patrick: i'd like a krabby patty, please. squidward: this is a hotel now. if you want a krabby patty, you'll have to get a room and order room service. patrick: ok, one krabby patty and one room with cheese. oh, and can i get cheese on the krabby patty, too. squidward: patrick, you only live 400 yards away. why do you want to check into a hotel. patrick: sometimes i just need to get away from it all.  wow, this hotel has everything. squidward:  gimme that. now sign the register. patrick: i didn't know there would be a test. i didn't study.  squidward: patrick, all you have to do is write your name. patrick: oh, ok.  do you mind..  don't look.  done.  squidward: close enough. here's your room key. patrick: i'll need some help with my bags. squidward: how can you have bags.. you just found out this is a hotel. patrick: this is a hotel. squidward:  spongebob. spongebob: yes, squidward. squidward: take patrick and his bags to his room. patrick: what about my krabby patty. squidward: and bring him a krabby patty. mr. krabs: squidward, you can take patrick's bags up to his room. spongebob, you go make the krabby patty.  squidward: oh, mr krabs. mr. krabs: what's the matter. afraid of a little manual labor.  i'm squidward and i have to work for a living. boo hoo hoo hoo hoo. squidward: fine. let's go, patrick.  mr. krabs:  this elevator is for guests only. take the employee elevator.  squidward: what's in these bags, rocks.  hey, these are rocks. why is your suitcase full of rocks. patrick: i don't tell you how to live your life. squidward: well, here's your room. patrick: wow. squidward: enjoy your stay. patrick: squidward, wait.  keep up the good work and there'll be more where that came from. spongebob: your krabby patty, sir.  hey, squidward, cool rock. patrick: hold on a second, spongebob.  here you are, my good man. spongebob: why, thank you, patrick. patrick: there's plenty more where that came from, my good friend  squidward. squidward: what now.. patrick: i don't like crusts on my sandwich. squidward: it's a bun. it's all crust. how am i suppose to cut the crust off a bun. patrick: peel it. squidward:  happy.  spongebob: room service. here's the 50 krabby patties you ordered. patrick: could you do one more thing for me. squidward: why don't you ask spongebob. patrick: good idea, squidward. spongebob: how may i serve you, sir. patrick: i need you to eat these krabby patties with me. spongebob: oh, yes, sir.  mr. krabs: hold on. squidward. patrick needs your help. squidward: what.. why didn't he ask me before i walked all the way downstairs. mr. krabs: he said he didn't want to bother you, but he got over it.  spongebob: thanks, squidward.  squidward: mr. krabs, this is ridiculous. patrick's being completely unreasonable. mr. krabs: he can be as unreasonable as he wants. the plaque, squidward, the plaque. squidward: but mr. krabs... mr. krabs: deny no guests.  why, hello, patrick. you need squidward to come up right away. he'll be right there. squidward: a bubble bath.. why would i give you a bubble bath.. patrick: well, because mr. krabs said you would. well, be sure to make my back extra shiny clean. squidward: that's it. i've had enough. patrick: squidward, wait. the toilet's backed up again. mr. krabs:  hey. hey, you can't take that elevator. you're an employee. squidward: not anymore. i quit.  mr. krabs: quit. you can't quit.  welcome to the krusty towers... squidward.. squidward: one room, please. on the top floor. mr. krabs: what do you think you're doing. squidward: i need a vacation. i'm overworked. and what better place to relax than krusty towers. where "we shall never deny a guest even the most ridiculous request". mr. krabs: i don't have to rent you a room. squidward: i've got cash. mr. krabs: oh... here's your room key. squidward: spongebob, carry my things to my room. spongebob: aye aye, guest sir.  squidward:  and you can carry me to my room. mr. krabs: and why in tarnation would i do that. you got four legs that aren't broken. squidward: the plaque.  too bad we couldn't take the elevator, but it is for guests only, and you are an employee. spongebob: your room, sir. squidward: and i'd like to order room service. i'd like a krabby patty with cheese, toenail clippings, and nose hairs. mr. krabs:  you've got to be kidding me. squidward: and i want it here in 5 seconds. spongebob: yes, sir.  here you are, sir. mr. krabs: well, you got your stinky sandwich. now eat it. squidward: oh, i'm not gonna eat this. you are. mr. krabs: what.. you're out of your mind if you think i'm going to eat that. spongebob: psst, that's not really a krabby patty with cheese, toenails, and nose hairs. mr. krabs:  now i get ya, boy. alright, squidward.  spongebob. spongebob: sorry, mr. krabs. we were all out of cheese. patrick:  hooray. mr. krabs:  what is it, squidward. squidward: send up a dozen cookies just like mother used to make. mr. krabs:  here's your homemade cookies. squidward:  these don't taste like anything mom used to make. mr. krabs: well, how did your mother make 'em. squidward: how should i know.. ask my mother.  mrs. tentacles:  hello.  mr. krabs:  spongebob.  spongebob: no good, mr. krabs. mrs. tentacles: allow me, boy.  mr. krabs: great. now that me laundry's in the trunk... spongebob: there's room for you to sit up front. mrs. tentacles: let's go bake some cookies, boys. spongebob and mr. krabs: hooray. mr. krabs:  well. squidward: i'm impressed. these are just like mother used to make. i just wish mom was a better cook. mr. krabs: so you're all taken care of. squidward: hm, just one teensy tiny problem. this room is hideous. redesign it. neptune the 14th would be nice. mr. krabs: what. squidward: "we shall never deny a guest even the most ridiculous request".  perfect. mr. krabs: this room is exactly the same as when we started. squidward: nothing like getting back to the basics. mr. krabs: let's get outta here, spongebob. squidward: oh, before you leave, i wanna go swimming. mr. krabs: the pool's out back. squidward: ha ha, are you crazy. i'm not going outside to swim.  come on in, the water's fine.  mr. krabs: anything else stupid and unreasonable that you want. squidward: nope, that's it. mr. krabs: you don't need me to chew your food for ya. or make you a back scratcher out of me own spine. or maybe extinguish the sun so the light don't get in your eyes.. squidward: no, i'm good. spongebob: me, too. patrick: wow, an indoor pool.. well, this place is fancy.  cannonball.  mr. krabs:  oh, that hotel was a bad idea from the start. patrick: that was a hotel. nurse: your bill, sir. mr. krabs: $15,000.. squidward: you're not gonna have a heart attack are you. mr. krabs: not at these prices. forget hotels. this hospital rack is where the money is. patrick: this is a hospital. mr. krabs: pack your bags, boys. you're going to medical school. spongebob & patrick: hooray. squidward: oh, boy. good bye krusty towers page 3 messages wildstar93 why's the krusty towers page going away. 20131124tz tanhamman huh. still here
