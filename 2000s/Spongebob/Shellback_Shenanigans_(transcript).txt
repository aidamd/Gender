spongebob:  good night, mr. krabs. mr. krabs: closing time already. spongebob: yep, i just gave the last order to the last customer. mr. krabs: oh, well i'll see you tomorrow. spongebob: mr. krabs,

tomorrow. spongebob:  mr. krabs, did you forget what tomorrow is. it's "bring your pet to work" day. mr. krabs: i don't need a special name for that. squidward's here all day. squidward: nice.  real nice. mr. krabs: oh, okay. you may give your snail a krabby patty. but please give me a tip, cause pets are sooo special. spongebob: you got it, mr. krabs.  thanks, mr. krabs.  mr. krabs. mr. krabs: what the..... spongebob:  mr. krabs: what, what.. spongebob: we're all out of krabby patties. mr. krabs: did you check the freezer.. spongebob: i checked the freezer, the spare freezer, the backup freezer, extra freezer, the rear freezer, the micro freezer, and the freezer under the stairs. mr. krabs: what about the freezer in the attic. spongebob: we don't have an attic. mr. krabs: no attic.. spongebob: you sold it, remember. mr. krabs: oh, yeah.  plankton: okay, now what's he saying. karen: i have no idea. plankton: what. i thought you said you read lips. karen: i can, but you took away my telescope away.  mr. krabs:  well, that settles it, spongebob. we're just gonna have to make a fresh batch of krabby patties. spongebob: a fresh batch. mr. krabs: you heard me. a fresh batch of krabby patties. plankton: okay, now what's he saying. karen: he said they're going to make a fresh batch of krabby patties. plankton: a fresh batch ofooh, this is good. this is really good. spongebob: when are we making this fresh batch of krabby patties, mr. krabs. mr. krabs: what. plankton: okay, now what'd he say. karen: what. plankton: i said, "what'd he say." karen: he said, "what." plankton: i have no idea, that's why i'm asking you what he said. karen: i know that, and i'm saying he said, "what.". plankton: i know that. wait... oh, he said, "what.". karen: yes. spongebob: wow, a fresh batch of krabby patties. gary's gonna go crazy. mr. krabs: you know, spongebob, might not be a good idea to bring your dirty snail into me restaurant. i think we just might want to reschedule "bring your pet to work" day. spongebob: no. mr. krabs, i promise that gary will be clean. i'll make sure he takes an extra long bath tonight. mr. krabs: okay, but make sure your pet is healthy, and clean. plankton: healthy and clean, fresh batch of krabby patties. ooh, i think i smell a plan.  spongebob: gary. i brought you a delicious treat. gary: meow. spongebob: oh, there you are gar bear i got you some kelp fries.  i was going to bring you a krabby patty, but we ran out. so, you enjoy them while i get your bath ready.  gary. your bath is ready. gary.  gary.  gary, not again come on out it's dirty.  gotcha. come on gary, quit messing ar....  gary: meow. spongebob:  great, gary,just great. now you need an extra, extra, extra, extra long bath. you're not going to come down from there, are you. gary: meow.  spongebob: ugh. you win, we'll bathe you in the morning.  plankton:  good morning sir. my name is sheldon r. shellcleaner, owner and operator of super shell cleaner vacations unlimited. can i ask you a question. are you tire of your dirty shell resulting in tireless hours of... spongebob:  gary. i'm going to start the bath. plankton: look i'll just cut to the chase. do you have a dirty shell and hate bath time. gary: meow. plankton: of course you do. that's why i must tell you about our limited time offer. where not 4, not 3, but 1 luxurious night here. at club shell. a perfect resort for snails. don't try to pinch yourself this could be... spongebob:  gary. the bath is ready. plankton: ...all yours. now i know what your thinking but i got you covered.  a temporary shell will be provided for you to wear while yours is being cleaned, and all of this is free of charge of course. spongebob:  gary. your bath is ready.  plankton: have a pleasant stay. bon voyage.  if my reasoning is correct, as spongebob's pet i'll get to witness krabby patties being made from scratch. then i can copy the formula, and destroy krabs once and for all. spongebob:  ahha there you are garbear.  oh, you naughty little snail hiding from me. i'm gonna give you a real good scrubbing. you have to be sparkly clean for "bring your pet to work day". and today is the day.  first i'm gonna start you off with a yummy smelling shower gel. plankton: wha....  spongebob: ahhh, smells nice, doesn't it. plankton: ugh... spongebob:  prepare yourself for the scrubbing of a lifetime.  plankton:  spongebob:  doesn't that feel good. plankton:  curses. oh, i mean... meow. spongebob:  gary, are you feeling alright. plankton: i've never felt better. uh, i mean... meow.  spongebob:  gary. you're turning green. and talking. plankton: no i'm not. spongebob:  we gotta get you to the pet hospital. plankton: pet hospital. but what about the fresh batch of krabby patties.. i mean, meow. spongebob: you're right, gary. i have to call mr. krabs and tell him i'm late. gosh, gary, your a lot talkative when you're sick.  doctor, my pet snail is turning green and he's talking. is he alright.  plankton:  meow.  spongebob: sooo, is that a yes or a no. sadie: i've never seen such a terrible thing. doctors, run this snail to the room.  plankton:  karen. oh, sorry. i thought you were someone else. sadie:  don't you worry, gary. i'm just going to give you some tests. it'll be over before you know it.  jennifermillie: sir, all we're saying is that your pet snail is still in the room taking tests. doctor#2:  that's what i'm not saying. spongebob: oh, gary.  doctor#2:  yes, we tried everything we can, sir, we just can't seem to find out what's wrong with him. i've never seen anything like it. spongebob: please save him, doctor.  plankton:  please. no more. sadie: it's okay, honey, the tests are over. i'm just going to give you a little pill. plankton: whew. i'm glad that's over. sadie:  open wide.  sadie: there, that wasn't so bad, was it.  that's not good...  uh, mr. squarepants. spongebob:  gary. sadie: the doctors say there's nothing we can do. it's best to take your snail home and let nature take it's course... spongebob: doctor, you don't mean...  doctor.. oh well, gary, this looks like it might be...... the end.  plankton: if i could just have a...  krabby patty before i go... spongebob: sure thing, gary, but...  plankton: but what. spongebob: well, now that you can talk... i'm running out of time to say i love you.  plankton:  oh, boy...  spongebob: don't you worry, gary, i'll whip you up the best krabby patty you've ever eaten.  tourist: so, once again we'd like to thank you for choosing club shell, and we hope to see you again soon. spongebob:  just a little further, garebare. gary:  plankton: yes.  spongebob:  now you just wait here, and daddy will fix you up that krabby patty i told you about. see you gary...  plankton: yes, spongefool come back with the formula and victory will be mine.  plankton: uh, mommy.   mr. krabs: plankton.  plankton: good day, sir. i'm just here to sample some of your delicious krabby fare.  whoa, hold on there, fido.  i'm going. i'm going. spongebob: wow, mr. krabs, gary's doing a great job as bouncer. he's really earning his pay. mr. krabs: well, he takes after you, lad.  pay.. ) )
