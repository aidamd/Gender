spongebob. are you just going to stand there like a halfwit, mouth agape. or are you going to fill these peoples' orders. spongebob: pipe down, squidward. this crowd looks angry. they're not going to wait any longer. i think i better give them what they need, and fast. squidward: i think so, too, or krabs will fire both of us.  on second thought, keep 'em waiting. spongebob: no can do, squidward. these people demand entertainment. squidward: enterwhat.  spongebob: how you doing, folks. all: hungry. spongebob: that's no problem, ladies and germs. 'cause spongebob is here to satisfy.  squidward: hey. bill: eating here was your idea. spongebob: i'd like to call this little number "striped sweater." .the best time to wear a striped sweater is all the time. one with a collar, turtleneck, that's the kind  'cause when you're wearing that one... special... sweater....  squidward, this crowd is insatiable. squidward: then why don't you back in the kitchen and grab some patties and give them what they came here for. spongebob: juggling. thanks, squiddy.  nancy: is this some kind of joke. spongebob: they want juggling and jokes at the same time. tough crowd. bill: oh, now what's he doing. spongebob: uhh, what do you call a vampire whose car breaks down 3 miles from a blood bank. a cab. bill: we're losing our appetites. spongebob: uh, okay. there's a nun, an astronaut, and a hairdryer. all: we want patties. spongebob: well, the most i can juggle is three, but the show must go on. whoa.  all: boo. spongebob: no.  my career is over. all those years clawing my way up. all the people i've stepped on. wasted.  bill: hey. finally. nancy: that's what we've been waiting for.  spongebob: they seem to like it when i put this patty on the grill. i may be able to save this act, yet. roll with it, spongebob. roll with it. there's more where that came from, folks.  all: yay. spongebob: you like that. bill: it's what we wanted all along. spongebob:  it seems to be working. but how do i follow it up. buns.  it's a stretch, but we've all got to push the envelope, sometime. okay, folks. how do you like this.  all: yeah. spongebob: i'm breaking new ground. time to get edgy. customers: we want onions. cheese. yeah. spongebob: ready for the grand finale.  all: whoopee. krabby patties. mr. krabs: well, spongebob, looks like you've finally found your calling. spongebob: i'll say. i'm so glad i gave up fry cooking for this. ) )
