written in red. squidward: everything's in red. spongebob: yeah, i know. squidward: we'd better start now if we want to get through this list before you die... of anticipation. spongebob: then let's roll.  bye, mr. krabs.  heads up, squidwardlooks like they're gonna replace you. squidward: uh, yeah. let's take a look at that list. spongebob: well, the first thing i want to do is show my best friend squidward to everybody in town.  hi, there, this is my best friend, squidward.  hey, kids, check it out. this is my best friend, squidward.  hi, i want to show you my best friend, squidward. squidward: hey, frank.  glad that's over. spongebob: good, cause we're onto our next activity. squidward: which is.... spongebob: i'm going to show my best friend squidward to everybody in town wearing a salmon suit. squidward: you're going to be wearing a salmon suit. spongebob:  that's a good one squidward.  next.  knockknock jokes. hey squid, knockknock. squidward: who's there. spongebob: i am.  squidward:  oh, yeah...  spongebob:  look out, everyone, friends in reverse.  spongebob: turn left, and... stop. see, that's what it would be like if you had me for a face. squidward:  i can't breathe.  squidward: are you sure you should be poking it like that. spongebob: who's the doctor here.  the last thing on the list is... squidward:  does it involve more dismemberment. spongebob: watch the sunset with squidward. squidward: sunset.  mr. krabs: the way i see it, the lad's got until sunset before that bomb hits his lower intestine. spongebob: hey, it's mr. krabs. hi, mr. krabs.  okay, see you later. squidward: c'mon buddy, you want a sunset, you'll get a sunset. spongebob: ah, underwater sunsets sure are beautiful. eh, squidward. squidward: yeah. spongebob: yeah, this is great, just the three of us. you, me,  ...and this brick wall that you built between us. squidward: yeah.  spongebob: sunsets always remind me of bowls of fruit. what do they make you think of, squidward.  squidward: explosions... i mean, erosion. spongebob: you know, if i were to die right now in some sort of fiery explosion due to the carelessness of a friend, well, that would just be okay.  wow, it feels like something just dropped into my lower intestine.  hey, smells like cherry. or maybe grape. blueberry.  here it is, the sunset. i always love to count it down. five... you do the rest, buddy. squidward: four... three... two... one...  spongebob: i guess we started too early. let's start again. squidward: five... four... three...  two...  oooone... well, at least i was able to make his last few hours meaningful.  i am such a good person.  spongebob: hey, squidward, check this out.  squidward, we already played babble like an idiot. squidward: why are you still here. spongebob: well, since we finished everything on the list, i thought i'd make up a new one.  i already filled up this book of ideas. we should be able to finish by january. squidward:  forget the book. i spent the whole day with you, doing all kinds of ridiculous things, because you were supposed to explode. spongebob: you want me to explode. squidward: yes. that's what i've been waiting for. spongebob: um, okay, i'll try.  gary. you are gonna finish your dessert and you are gonna like it.  now it's your turn. squidward:  that's not what i meant, you barnacle head. spongebob: oh, good one. squidward: no. you were supposed to explode into a million pieces.  spongebob: why would i do that. squidward: because the pie you ate was a bomb. spongebob: what pie. squidward: the one that i left sitting on the counter this morning that i bought from pirates for 25 bucks and i didn't know it was a bomb, and you ate it... th... that pie. spongebob: pie...pie...  oh, you mean this pie. i was saving it in my pocket for us to share. let's eat.  oops.  squidward:  ouch.  ) )
