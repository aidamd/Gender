squidward: la da de, la da dum, la da doo. la da dee. ah, it's a great day for the art world.  famous art critic fredrick t. nitpick will be critiquing my latest masterpiece. i love hearing myself talk.  spongebob: oh, hi squid...  whoa.  i love your hat. squidward:  don't touch it. and it's not a hat. it's a beret. spongebob: a beret. oh, where can i get one. squidward: sorry, spongebob. berets are only worn for true artists, like moi. patrick: you're an artist. squidward: yes, i'm an artist. what are you two bubbleheads doing anyway. spongebob: we're making arts and crafts. i've been learning the fine art of basket weaving.  i made this one using designs of me and my best friends.  and i also made this cute little scallop house.  spongebob: and i made this wallet,  and i crocheted money to go in it.  squidward: so, you've been counterfeiting currency. and what's doorknob number two been up to.  patrick:  i've been making baskets too.  darn. this hammer is defective. spongebob: do you want to make crafts too. squidward: crafts.  this isn't summer camp. i am a true artiste.  patrick: oh man. i'll never make art like you and...squidward.  spongebob: hey, don't be sad. you can be an artist too. i'll find something that will tap into your particular artistic skill set.  now let me see. oh, this'll be perfect. now, start with a rock...  patrick: uh. spongebob: a little glue...  patrick: uh. spongebob: stick on a couple of googly eyes...  patrick: whoa. slow down, spongebob. spongebob: and presto: a rock with googly eyes. patrick: whoa. i did not see that coming. spongebob: now you try.  patrick: i'm scared. spongebob: you can do this. patrick: i shall make the attempt.  privacy, please. spongebob: oh, sorry.  patrick: i've done it. spongebob: yeah, let's take a look. patrick:  behold. spongebob: oh. oh. oh, it's beautiful. patrick: i'm an artist. spongebob and patrick: hooray. squidward: hate.  frederick nitpick: why, hello, mr. tentacles. i'm frederick t. nitpick, world famous art critic. this is your artwork, i presume. squidward: oh, it certainly is. this piece represents my struggle to reveal my genius to a moronic world.  witness "la vista squidward". stunning, isn't it. frederick nitpick: my considered opinion is "eww." i'm going to have to confiscate your artist beret.  squidward: what. no. no, you can't do that. frederick nitpick: sorry, but i'm looking for a real artist. patrick: i'm an artist. hooray. frederick nitpick:  an artist, eh. squidward: no, wait, come back. frederick nitpick:  now, which one of you two is the artiste.  spongebob: we both are. it's lots of fun. would you like to make something, too.  frederick nitpick: i'm a critic. i don't make things. i judge things. for instance, i judge your work.  lame.  patrick: don't judge me.  frederick nitpick:  oh, my guacamole frijoles. it's so, so, primitive and naive. you're a genius. patrick: is that good. frederick nitpick: i'll give you 500 bucks for it. and this hat.  squidward: hey. frederick nitpick:  you are a master artist, my friend  squidward: you can't give that dunderhead the artist hat. frederick nitpick: who's the critic here.  spongebob: wow. did you hear that, squidward. patrick is an artist. squidward: oh, , selling one lousy piece doesn't make you an artist. spongebob: how many lousy pieces have you sold, squidward. squidward: well, about...um, um, well, i'll bet he never sells another one of those ridiculous trinkets.  ted:: hey there, i noticed your hat. are you an artist. patrick: yeah. ted: do you have any art. i have a real craving for creativity. patrick: um...ok.  art.  ted: thanks, man. here's fifty bucks.  squidward: i'll bet he never sells another. sally: hey, ted. where'd you get that art. ted: from that pink genius over there. sally: i want to buy one. nat: me too. man: i also. squidward: i'll bet spongebob:  squidward, i think we should have a little talk about your gambling problem.  squidward: i actually want to go to work today.  spongebob:  oh. i'm almost late to be early for work. see ya later, patrick.  patrick: so long, my trusted, yet untalented friend.  one for you. and one for you. and one for...  i've run out of rocks to put googly eyes on. i've run out of rocks. harold: got anything else. patrick: um, the artist needs a long time.  harold: he's so eccentric. patrick: i'm all out of rocks. what am i going to do now. that was my thing. oh.  tartar sauce.  that stinks, too.  the artist needs a lunch break.  squidward: oh, not you again. may i take your order. patrick:  uuuuuummmmm. uhhhhhhhhh. i'm thinking about having a krabby patty. squidward: one krabby patty  patrick: but i'm wondering if that might be too predictable.  squidward:  then, what do you want. patrick: i don't know. i'm not feeling very inspired at the moment.  spongebob: hiya, patrick. ordering up a delicious krabby patty. patrick: maybe, i don't know. i'm in a creative slump. spongebob: oh, patrick, that's terrible.. squidward: just order already. patrick: ok, i want new ideas to spice up hunger for my goodly goods. squidward: off the menu. choose something off the menu. we don't serve artistic advice here. patrick: well then, why is it on the menu.  squidward: huh. what. mr. krabs: get back to work, mr. squidward. squidward: in case you haven't noticed,  this is not an artist hat.  patrick: oh, you can borrow mine.  squidward: beautiful.  spongebob: make yourself comfortable, mister patrick. our artistic consultant will be right with you.  spongebob: this is mr. tentacles. he'll be handling all your artistic advice needs. squidward: mmhmm. patrick: mmhmm. pleasure. spongebob: here's your krabby patty.  shall i put it on your tab. patrick: oh, yeah. keep it open. we may be here all night. let me say up front, i'm a fan. i'm excited to learn from a genius like you. my artistic needs and knowledge are in your hands. i hope someone's writing all this. ok........... advise. squidward:  why don't you just concentrate on your patty.  patrick:  of course, it's so obvious now. how did i not see it earlier. squidward's a genius. i know now what i must do.  frederick nitpick: brilliant.  i've never seen such an example of raw creativity. this piece will turn the art world on its head. i hereby declare this the next big thing.  spongebob: you did it, patrick. you found your inspiration. patrick:  and i'm going to need some more of those patty thingies. spongebob: you got it, buddy.  mr. krabs: huh.  ooh, money. money, money, money, money, money, money, money.  what the.  spongebob.  patrick.  what's the meaning of this. patrick: it's my art. uh, i buy krabby patties for $3 and i..i sell them for $50.  squidward: ha and ha. patrick: why is he so mad, squidward. i was just following your advice. mr. krabs: what.. it was your idea, huh.  spongebob: here's a whole new batch of krabby patty canvases. mr. krabs: great, spongebob. that'll be fifty bucks. nat:  it's so expensive. mr. krabs: and here's your patty. one more art patty, mr. star. nat: it's such an honor to meet you. patrick: i can only imagine. apprentice. make another of my masterpieces, good man.  patrick: if you work real hard, you might be an artist too someday.  patrick: mm, probably not. needs more glitter.  ) )
