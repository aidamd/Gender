the magic conch. the club always takes its advice before we do anything. patrick: the shell knows all. spongebob: oh, magic conch shell, what do we need to do to get out of the kelp forest. magic conch: nothing. patrick: the shell has spoken. squidward: nothing.. we can't just sit here and do nothing.  squidward:  i can't believe you two are gonna take advice from a toy.  squidward:  all

spongebob. you haven't eaten in days.  how about you, patrick. a big boy's gotta eat. well, you can't have any.  and do you know why, spongebob. because your club president is a shell.  if you had listened to me you'd have food, shelter, and a roaring fire. but instead you listened to a talking clam...  that tells you nothing. as if the answers to solve all your problems will fall right out of the sky.  fall right out of the sky.  scooter: dude, we're falling right out the sky. we gotta drop the load.  spongebob and patrick: praise the magic conch.  squidward: uh, hey, uh, spongebob... that sure is a lot of food you got there. spongebob: it's a gift from the magic conch. squidward: everything sure looks delicious.  oh. smoked sausages. my favorite.  uh, hey, uh,  spongebob, i...you know
