make me laugh.  mr. krabs: what. are you out of your liquidabsorbing mind. spongebob: why, is there something wrong. mr. krabs: haven't ye ever heard the saying "if you don't stop making that face, it'll freeze that way". spongebob and patrick: uuh, no. mr. krabs: let me tell you the story of face freeze.  it were a cold day, in november, and in bikini bottom lived a man who loved to make faces. and the one he liked best was to stick his tongue out.  but what he really liked, was to stick his tongue at people.  norma rechid: how rude.   mr. krabs: until one day, when he stuck his tongue out for the 444th time,  his face froze with his tongue sticking out... fred: huh, huh... huh. mr. krabs: permanently. mable: weirdo. fred:  no... no. mr. krabs: he couldn't open his mouth for months. until one day, his tongue dried up and fell off. spongebob and patrick: oh, no. mr. krabs: so are you fonna keep making faces, boys. spongebob and patrick: huhuh. mr. krabs: good. i hope you've learned your lesson. spongebob: i'm glad mr. krabs caught us before it was too late. let's agree never to make faces again. patrick: done and done. spongebob: patrick. don't even smile. that's considered making a face. patrick: right, gotcha. no problem. not gonna make faces. no faces... at all. spongebob: no faces... at all. yeah. this is...  easy. how you holding up. patrick: huh, fine.
