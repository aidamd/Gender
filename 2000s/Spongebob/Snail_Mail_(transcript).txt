french narrator: ahh, a happy pineapple under the sea. let's take a peek inside, shall we.  french narrator: you will notice that the sponge is bored, because his best friend patrick is away.  spongebob: ohh.  spongebob: hmm... what's this.  spongebob: all alone. no one to talk to. why not write to a total stranger. connect with other mermaid man and barnacle boy pen pals today. oh, i've never had a pen pal.  spongebob: hmm... "dear pen pal, my name is spongebob squarepants..." oh, that's great. "i work at a restaurant. i love frying and i'm very good at it. sincerely, your new best friend." behold, the perfect letter. now for the envelope.  spongebob: gary, get off of that. you'll spot my masterpiece. gary: meow, meow.  french narrator: uhoh. it looks as if the domesticated snail has unintentionally deformed the word "frying." making it look like the word "flying." this is probably going to be a problem later on. spongebob: nah, it's just a little slime.  spongebob: ah, perfect. french narrator: 4 to 6 days later...  spongebob: "dear spongebob, wow. you know how to fly." fly. what does he mean by...  french narrator: see. what did i tell you. spongebob: gary, my pen pal thinks i can fly. gary: meow. spongebob: ha. what a silly misunderstanding. "i can't believe i know a real life pilot. i wish i could watch you fly, because i am dying."  dying.. not pen pal.   spongebob: i don't want to let him down and say that i can't fly. 'cause then, his dying wish will never come true.  priest: we're gathered here today to celebrate the life of pen pal. he died disappointed.  spongebob: time to make pen pal's wish come true with a tiny white lie.  spongebob: "dearest pen pal, yes, i can fly. boy, do i love flying. fly, fly, fly, fly, fly." french narrator: 4 to 6 more days later...  spongebob: "dear spongebob, i'll be at the bikini bottom air show tomorrow. please meet me there so i can finally see you fly.."  oh no. what have i done. what have i done. what have i done. i can't fly, gary. i'm not a flier. i'm a liar.  gary: meow. spongebob: good thinking, gary.  sandy will know just what to do.  sandy: what can i do ya for, squarepants. spongebob: i did a bad thing, sandy. i did a very bad thing.  sandy: here. take these. they're clean. spongebob: no, no. it's not that. it's... it's...  spongebob: i lied.  i lied. i lied. i lied. i lied. i lied.  sandy: relax, spongebob. you're twitchin' like a prairie dog on a cowskin rug. spongebob: uh, what on a which. sandy: what's got your behind abuzzin'. spongebob: by who i've a where's in. sandy:  what did you lie about, spongebob.  spongebob: well, there was this big misunderstanding and now my pen pal thinks i can fly. and i don't think i ever mean it, but now i have to. he doesn't see me fly and i don't know how. if i don't fly, he'll die disappointed. i made a horrible mistake, sandy. please help.  sandy: well, it ain't no lie if you actually learn how to fly. and i can help you with that. spongebob: really. sandy: sure.  spongebob: seatbelt, check. controls, check.  sandy: proper take off, check. how are ya doing in there. spongebob: oh, i'm good.  spongebob: oh, there's my house.  spongebob: oop. i've forgot to feed gary. gary: meow. spongebob: oh, hi gary.  sandy:  failed. alright, let's try that again. spongebob. hmm.  sandy: alright, spongebob. i tied ya up to a rope so you won't be able to go too far off course.  sandy: contact.  spongebob:  i'm doing it. i'm actually doing it. whoohoo. whoohoo.  spongebob: did i do it. sandy: hmm. good enough.  spongebob: hey, you must be pen pal. frail fish:  spongebob: what an honor it is to finally meet you. oh, you pretty, pretty pen pal you. frail fish: hmm.  spongebob: i just wanted to say that today... today...
