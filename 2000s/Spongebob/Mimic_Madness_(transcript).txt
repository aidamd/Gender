mr. krabs: all right, krusty crew, i want to remind you all that you're representing the krusty krabthe greasiest greasy spoon you'll ever have the privilege of serving.  spongebob: whoo. you tell 'em, mr. krabs.  bring it around town. yeah.  squidward:  bring it around somewhere.  mr. krabs: open the doors and let the consuming commence. i'll be in me office polishing yesterday's booty.   squidward:  "i'll be in me office polishing yesterday's booty."   mr. krabs: i heard that, mr. squidward.  squidward: it wasn't an insult, mr. krabs. it was aaaa tribute. haven't you ever heard of "imitation is the sincerest form of flattery".  mr. krabs: you trying to tell me that was a "complement". squidward: exactly. it's my homage to you and your love for money. mr. krabs:  well, you got me there. i do love money.  excellent observation, mr. squidward.  squidward: oh, boy, that was a close one. spongebob: yes, it was a very close one, squidward. close and warm.  mr. krabs was really flattered by your imitation. squidward: already forgot about it.  spongebob: imitation plus flattery equals happy people.   tom: whoa, okay. everybody, come on now. settle down, time to eat your patties.  spongebob:  whoa, okay now. everybody, settle down, time to eat your patties.  huh.  tom: wow, that's just like me.   tom:  i said eat your patties.  squidward: hurry up, spongebob, i need two orders of krabby krust stat. spongebob: no problem, squidward, i'll get you those orders as soon as possible.  spongebob:  or never, whichever comes first.  spongebob: oh, swoon. that imitation stuff really works. look out, world.  i'm gonna flatter your socks off.   patrick: hmm. nope.  ah.  spongebob:  hey, there, patrick old buddy. patrick: what. oh, hi, patrick. what's shaking. spongebob:  i'm gonna eat ice cream and go jellyfishing with my good buddy, spongebob. patrick: sounds good to me, "me."  spongebob: ah, it's just me, patrick. fooled ya.  patrick:  you can't fool me, "me." that's the worst spongebob impression i've ever seen. spongebob:  wait, what.  plankton: rook to king four.  plankton: checkmate...  sandy: plankton, maybe we should play a game that's a little less dangerous. you're flatter than hammered horse hockey.  spongebob:  cattywampus, plankton. you're just about the teeniest galdang critter i ever did see. yeehaw.  spongebob:  and you are the fuzziest nuteating scientist i've ever seen.  spongebob:  i like to use science for good. spongebob:  really. i always use science for evil. sandy:  that is me to a texas "t," spongebob. he nailed you too, plankton. plankton: it was okay. he got my face right, but that voice is terrible.  spongebob: oh, those impressions are making everyone so happy. i can't stop doing them. i can't..i won't.  spongebob:  80,000 impressions later... french narrator: would you please stop imitating me. it is starting to get very annoying.  nathiel waters: uh, can i have some extra napkins please. spongebob:  oh, you want some napkins, please. nathiel waters: stop it. stop imitating me. for the love of neptune, shut your talented mouth.  spongebob: okay, bye. yup, everybody still loves it.   spongebob:  are we having fun yet, squidward tentacles.  squidward: oh, that's it. i can't stand the perfect impression of me anymore. i never thought i'd say this, but i'm tired of looking at myself. i quit.  sandy: boy, spongebob is really getting out of control with his impression obsession.  sandy: ah. mr. krabs: right you are, sandy. spongebob has lost touch with reality. i've seen it before. they call it: the "mocking mimicry madness."  spongebob:  the mocking mimicry madness.   spongebob: oh, oh, oh.  sandy: huh. oh.  sandy: all right, remember guys, this is an intervention, so we need to make sure that above all, spongebob knows how much we all care about him. plankton: why don't we just destroy him and get it over with. squidward: here here.  patrick: you leave my best friend alone. plankton and squidward:  it was just a suggestion. mr. krabs: spread out. all right, you scurvy dogs, spongebob needs us, and more importantly, i need himto stop imitating me customers. sandy: right guys, that's... almost... the spirit.  spongebob: oh, boy, someone's at the door. i can't wait to imitate 'em.  oh, hello, patrick. and sandy. and squidward. and mr. krabs. plankton too. five at once,

formula, mr. k. would you remind me again. mr. krabs:  sure, spongebob, i got it right  oh, no, you don't, plankton.  mr. krabs: that was a pretty good impression, though. plankton:  thanks.  sandy:
