doo doo doodoo. the musical doodle. patrick: spongebob. hold still. this won't hurt a bit. spongebob: huh. sandy: get him.  sandy: just as i thought. you're suffering from a condition known as "earworm." you see, when your brain becomes stuck on a catchy tune, you're spectable with earworm infection and you've got a nasty one there.  mr. krabs: let's just rip the little sucker out. sandy: hold it. we can't do that. it might damage his brain. the only way to drive the earworm out is with another catchy tune. mr. krabs: ooh. ooh. ooh. i got one. it's an old sea shanty me and me mates used to sing on the high seas. .it be drowsy and wet on the mighty high seas, for i need a boat for rapid disease. oh, mateys. oh, mateys. don't ever weep. if i so ever sleep, cast me into the deep..  he ain't budgin'. sandy: i'll be darned if anyone can resist a western song while wearing a western hat. come here, you. .oh, life on the prairie is lonesome indeed. not a friend in sight among the rustling weeds. so, when i get lonesome, i don't have a conniption, i just fire up my friend, generator contraption..  that only seems to have made him madder. we need somebody with really musical talent to get rid of this thing. squidward: alright. i'll do it. but only because you required an artist of such high talent. sandy: oh, right. squidward. you play that little doohickey. squidward: it's called a clarinet.  sandy: you did it. drove the little critter out. patrick: hold still, buddy.  spongebob: oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, squidward. squidward: alright. you're greatful. now leave me alone.  squidward: that was a near little tune i came up with today, if i do say so myself.  squidward: oh, yeah. that's catchy stuff, squiddy. catchy stuff. mmmhmm.  ) )
