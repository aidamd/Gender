squidward, what's gray and ugly and has six arms. little squidward: i don't know, but have you looked in the mirror lately. squidward: what did you...  spongebob: oh, that's a good one, squidward, now let me try.  have you heard any good jokes, mr. paper. paper: what happened to the paper that fell in the ocean. spongebob: i don't know, what happened to the paper that fell in the ocean. paper: it was all washed up.  spongebob: lalalalalalalalalala... squidward:  haha, i'm having so much fun with my new shellcart. ahhaha. hey, spongebob, can your stupid paper do this.  spongebob: nope.  squidward: well, you can't play music with a piece of paper.  spongebob:  hooray. hooray. that was great, squidward. all those wrong notes you played made it sound more original. squidward: what. i didn't play any wrong notes.  spongebob: yeah, see, you're playing it like this...  ...when ordinarily it goes like this...  i'm partial to doing it in the key of aminor myself.  ah, nothing like a duet between buddies, eh, squidward. squidward:  give me my paper back. now let go of it. i said let go of it.  let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go...  spongebob: i can't. squidward: what do you mean you can't.  spongebob: i can't. you made me promise no matter how much you begged, and pleaded, and cried not to give the paper back to you ever. squidward: i never said anything like that. spongebob: sure you did, squidward, look.  squidward:  take it, spongebob. take it, please. and promise me, no matter how much i may beg and plead and cry, don't give that paper back to me ever. spongebob: wanna see it again. squidward: no, i don't wanna see it again. just give me that paper. spongebob: sorry, squidward, i am sworn to a promise.  maybe i should get going. squidward: wait, wait, maybe we can trade for something.  yeahyeah, something, something...  aha, wait up, spongebob. wait. hold on there, chum.  i'm going to make you an offer.  spongebob: wow,

okay...  oh, i get it. you're just testing me. don't worry, squidward, i won't let you down. a promise is a promise. squidward: listen, you.  you are not going anywhere until we strike a deal.  gotta get that paper.  spongebob: squidward.  squidward: trade...  spongebob: hey, listen...  squidward: everything must go. well, that's the last of it.  i've given you everything but the shirt off my back.  spongebob: oh, squidward, is this still part of the test. because it's...it's really getting harder and harder to keep my promise. squidward: okay, the shirt.  take it. take my shirt. spongebob: squidward's shirt. i've always loved that shirt. okay, okay, i'll trade.  i can break a promise for this. squidward, do you want your other stuff, cause this is all i'll need. squidward: you can have all that junk, 'cause now i've got this. i've got the paper, and you've got my useless garbage.  i got it. haha and you can't have it.  i got it, you're a sucker. you're a sucker, sucker.

tada. children: boo. squidward:  okay, okay, uhh, helicopter.  gentlemen, start your engines. i'm flying. oh yeah, i'm flying. i'm flying. that's right, that's right, here we go now.  i'm flying, flying, flying, flying, flying, flying, flying, flying...  ...flying.  wait, more impressions. a guy throwing a piece of paper on the ground.  a guy stomping on the piece of paper  i'm a guy who traded everything he owns for a... patrick:  ...a worthless piece of paper.  hey, thanks, it's just what i needed, squidward.  nice shirt, spongebob.  squidward:  does anybody have any sunscreen. ) )
