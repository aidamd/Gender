hooks. spongebob: the hooks. mr. krabs: aye.  the hooks. they dangle down and draw you close with their pleasing shapes and their beguiling colors. and just when you think you found the land of milk and honey, they grab you by the britches...  ...and haul you way up high. then higher, and higher, and higher  until you're hauled up to the surface, flopping and gasping for breath. and then, they cook ya, and then, they eat ya, or worse... spongebob:  what could be worse than that. mr. krabs: gift shops.  spongebob:  don't let 'em get me, mr. krabs. mr. krabs: there, there, boy. they won't get
