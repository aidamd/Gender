they're the most vicious, ravenous horde of hooligans in the sea. mr. krabs: ravenous did you say. that's another word for hungry, isn't it.  welcome wild ones. they'll be drawn here like a sailor at a tattoo parlor. with the special biker parking and authentic biker decor, with real bloodstains. and to top it off, a custom chopper patty. and best of all, i'll raise me prices 150%. i'll make a fortune. spongebob: mr. krabs, this is serious.  mr. krabs: that kid needs a vacation unpaid of course.  spongebob: squidward.  squidward: yes, spongebob. spongebob: a horrible biker gang called the "wild ones" are coming. we've got to run, hide.  squidward:  oh, my. this sounds serious. luckily, i know just what you should do. listen closely. spongebob: uhhuh. squidward: get a good grip on your pants.  turn around.  spongebob: like this, squidward. squidward: that's it.  spongebob: patrick. patrick: hello, spongebob. spongebob: an evil gang of bikers are coming to ravage bikini bottom.

pants.  spongebob:  and their leather socks. patrick: if we dressed up like that then we'd be the big, scary bikers and they'd be little baby doodyheads. spongebob: say that again, patrick. patrick: little baby doodyheads. spongebob: no, no, not that part. the part about dressing up like big, scary bikers.  what do you think, patrick. do i look tough. patrick: i wouldn't mess with ya. spongebob:

spongebob: patrick, it's working. they think we're...vicious bikers.  bikini bottom, your salvation is here. patrick:  see. spongebob: patrick, that's your salivation. patrick: oh. spongebob: so, squidward, are you ready to do your part. squidward: does that part include laughing at you. cause you two look even more idiotic than usual. spongebob: don't we look vicious and bloodthirsty. patrick: i'm bloodthirsty. see.  want some. spongebob: oh, no thank you, patrick. i'm drinking diet blood.  see squidward. we walk the walk but can we talk the talk. do you want to join our biker gang. squidward: no, i don't. patrick: what about our biker club. squidward: no. spongebob: how about our biker organization. squidward: no. i don't want to join your biker alliance, your outfits, or your fellowships. spongebob: what about our coalition. patrick: ooh, i don't know. that one's pretty exclusive. spongebob:  we'll just pencil you down as undecided.  hi, mr. krabs. we're the bikini bottom bad boys and we're bad to the bone. mr. krabs: this'll be great. those bikers can work up an appetite beating you up in the parking lot. then they can fill up on delicious krabby patties then they can beat you up again. spongebob: please, mr. krabs. we're going to run off those bikers and save the krusty krab. mr. krabs: you're not running off any of me paying customers. you can stay and get beat up in the parking lot if you wish. spongebob: then can we save the town. squidward: has it ever crossed your mind that you might be getting all worked up over nothing. spongebob: squidward, when have i ever been known to overreact.  squidward. we're out of napkins.  out of napkins.  squidward. i accidentally removed the "do not remove by penalty of law" tag on my mattress. hide me. hide me.  squidward. squidward. i've gone blind.  oh. thanks, squidward.  squidward: spongebob, you always overreact to everything. it's one of your many annoying traits. spongebob:  me. annoying.  yeah right. squidward: you are so wrong about everything, spongebob, that the only thing that i am completely sure about is that there is no motorcycle gang headed this way.  what was that. mr. krabs: ahoy there, mateys. motorized vehicles headed over the horizon. squidward: what.  gimme that.  don't just stand there, save us. spongebob: patrick, i know this looks like the end, but you and i can get through anything. as long as we do it together.  patrick. patrick.  well, it's just you and me, squidward. but i want you to know that we can get through this. as long as we... squidward: panic. run for your lives.  the wild ones are coming.  lenny: the wild ones.  mable, get the kids.  charlie: honey, i got the napkins. oh, what have i missed this time. squidward:  please don't kill me. i want to join you. it's been my lifelong dream to be to be a member of a motorcycle gang. i even knitted my own wild ones jacket.  i want to ride to live and live to ride.  i'll do whatever you want. i'll betray my friends and neighbors. just let me live. biker #1: what's that, missy. biker #2: what. biker #1: howdy, we're the "mild ones". spongebob: mild ones.  oh. biker #1: gimme back my m. let's go, boys. mr. krabs: don't you want to spend any money. biker #1: don't you want to kiss the seat of my pants. let's ride.  spongebob: goodbye. they seem really nice. hey, where's squidward. squidward:
