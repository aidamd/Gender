mr. krabs: where could they be. they should've been here hours ago. arrgh. not a customer in sight. if i don't make any money today, i surely break out in a rash. spongebob: yippee. i'm rich. look patrick, eight gold doubloons. mr. krabs: wait, i saw it first. hah.  mine, mine. huh.. spongebob: boy mr. krabs, you sure are sweaty. mr. krabs: what's this. where are the doubloons. spongebob:

sweaty. mr. krabs: have you finished cleaning the tables. spongebob: i cleaned the tables mr. krabs. mr. krabs: ay, but did you scrape all the gum off the underside. spongebob:  i already took care of it. mr. krabs: ha ha ha. all right, lads. looks like you've shanghaied me. patrick: my turn.  five.  one of your shipmates has been a bad pirate. send him to the brig. hmmm.  it's off to jail for you, mr. krabs. mr. krabs: patrick, you're fired. patrick: but i don't even work here. mr. krabs: would you like a job, starting now.  patrick: boy, would i.. mr. krabs:  you're fired. spongebob: my turn.  one, two, three, four.  look for the deacon's goose thru the fork in the old tree and head that way.  well, i see mr. krabs' zipper is undone. mr. krabs:  shiver me timbers. spongebob:  just kidding, mr. krabs. i'm almost to the treasure. your turn again mr. krabs. mr. krabs:  ooh, fish eyes. one, two. spongebob:  you are a real pirate. go straight to the "x" that marks the spot. you get to dig for treasure mr. krabs. mr. krabs: treasure.  there it is. it's the flying dutchman's treasure. gold, gold, gold. mine, mine, mine, mine, mine.  spongebob: hey, mr. krabs is getting all sweaty again. fred:  rev up those fryers, cause i am sure hungry for one help. help.  my leg. mr. krabs: can't you see we're closed..  ready for another round. this is my kind of game. spongebob and patrick:

can't walk out on me now. spongebob: i'm sorry, mr. krabs.  see you tomorrow.  huh. who's there.  mr. krabs: c'mon, spongebob. one more game. i can smell the treasure. spongebob:  mr. krabs, it is late. go to bed. good night, mr. krabs.  mr. krabs: wind is perfect, the tide is right. let's hunt for treasure. spongebob: mr. krabs, you gotta...  mr. krabs: that's awful lad. if the dutchman hears ya, we'll never get his treasure. spongebob: but mr. krabs... mr. krabs: i'll roll for ya boy. spongebob: but, mr... mr. krabs:  eight paces, now that's a good start lad. spongebob: but, mr... mr. krabs: one, two, three... spongebob:  mr. krabs. i wanna go to bed. mr. krabs, i'm sorry, but it's just a game, ya know. mr. krabs: a game. that's... right. of course it is, my mistake. i guess i got a little carried away, eh. on this treasure we're dealing here. sorry, for disturbing ya, lad.  avas. pineapple, ho. heave two, and prepare to be boarded. spongebob: aw, go home already. i'm done playing that game, mr. krabs. mr. krabs: it's captain krabs to you, and this is no game. we're gonna be pirates. spongebob: pirates. mr. krabs: ay. how'd you like to go on a real treasure hunt, with a real treasure map. spongebob and patrick:  treasure.  we're gonna be pirates, we're gonna be pirates. mr. krabs: ay, ay, ay. relay that skipping. pirates don't skip.  put on this pirate garb, so i won't be embarrassed to be seen with ya. arrgh. spongebob: oh, patrick. look. peg legs and eye patches. mr. krabs: now, don't you feel more like pirates. spongebob:  look, i'm peggy the pirate.  patrick:  i'm blind beard the pirate.  spongebob: ow. mr. krabs: arrgh.  keep a sharp lookout. according to the map, we're close to the first landmark. spongebob: really. can we see the map. mr. krabs: uh... no. only the captain can lay eyes on the map. spongebob: okie dokie, then. mr. krabs: arrgh, a pirate doesn't say, "okie dokie, then." a pirate says, "arrgh." spongebob: okie... oops.  i mean...  arrgh. captain krabs.  captain, we're about to hit... uhh... i mean... arrgh, capt., arrgh, we're, arrgh, about, arrgh, to hit, arrgh... mr. krabs: out with it man, arrgh. patrick: i, arrgh, think, arrgh, he's trying, arrgh, to say....  land... mr. krabs: arrgh. from now on, only the captain says, arrgh. status report, mr. squarepants. spongebob: the whole ship is underwater captain. mr. krabs: arrgh, we're marooned then. our treasure hunt will have to continue on foot. this is it boys, from the seaweed with two leaves on it. 10,000 paces east. spongebob: but mr. krabs, that seaweed has...  which way captain. mr. krabs: answer patrick. which was is east. patrick: uhh... let's see, uhh...  that way captain. mr. krabs: 9,997... 9,998... 9,999... 10,000. where's the "x". supposed to be right here. 10,000 paces east. patrick: ooh. east. i thought you said "weast". mr. krabs: weast. what kind of compass you reading lad. patrick: this one, sir. mr. krabs: that's west, patrick. you're fired again. 9,551... 9,552... spongebob: mr. krabs, we're tired. patrick: and hungry. mr. krabs: ooh. so this is my crew. you get a little tired, and a weebit hungry, and you want to shove off for home. arrgh. that sickens me. a pirate is not judged by the notches in his compass, but by the sides of his booty. a pirate is judged by the loyalty and his crew. and without a loyal crew, what am i captain of. just a bunch of sand.  patrick: don't cry, captain krabs. spongebob:  yeah, we'll be your loyal crew.  mr. krabs: you'll stay with me then. spongebob and patrick: we'll be the most loyal pirate crew ever. mr. krabs: i knew i could count on you boys. one for all. spongebob and patrick: and all for one.  spongebob: i'm so loyal, i don't even mind sleeping on the cold, hard ground while captain krabs sleeps in his warm, dry tent. patrick: i'm so loyal, i haven't bathed in weeks. spongebob: but we've only been gone a few hours. patrick: i know.  spongebob: i'm so loyal, i don't wanna sleep till we find the treasure. let's go see if the captain will go now. spongebob and patrick: captain krabs. spongebob: he's not here. patrick: look. the treasure map. spongebob: only the captain can look at the map, patrick. patrick: yeah... spongebob: patrick, what are you doing. patrick: nothing. spongebob: patrick, you're not suppose to look at the map.  patrick: i'm not looking, i'm touching. there's no rule against that is there. spongebob: no, guess there isn't.  oops. patrick, it opened by itself.  spongebob and patrick: the map, the map, gotta see it, gotta look at it.  patrick: spongebob. spongebob: yeah. patrick: did you notice something familiar about this map. spongebob: you mean, like that it's our game board taped to a piece of paper. mr. krabs:  do you think this is a problem. spongebob and patrick:  mr. krabs. mr. krabs: sneaking peeks at me treasure. patrick: we're sorry. mr. krabs: that's mutiny on my ship. so you think ol' captain krabs has gone crazy, do ye. spongebob: not at all, captain krabs. we don't think that at all. patrick: i think that. mr. krabs: i'm gonna throw you overboard for saying that. spongebob:  look. it's the "x". mr. krabs:  "x" marks the spot. spongebob: wow. that game really is based on a real treasure map. mr. krabs: well, what are you waiting for lads. dig. dig. dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig. spongebob: we got it captain krabs. mr. krabs: ha, ha. hand it up to me lads. heave.  mr. krabs: we finally found it.  female singers: the dutchman's treasure. all: wow. spongebob: what are you going to do with your share, patrick. patrick: i don't know. how are you going to spend your share, spongebob. mr. krabs: what shares. you're not getting any of my treasure. spongebob: we found it together. so we deserve a share. mr. krabs: well, i'm the captain. and i say it's mine. spongebob: what about loyalty. mr. krabs: all for one. spongebob: and one for all. mr. krabs: all for one. spongebob: and one for all. mr. krabs: all for one. spongebob: and one for all. flying dutchman:  i'm the flying dutchman. mr. krabs: all for one. spongebob: and one for all. flying dutchman:  i'm the flying dutchman.  who dares wake the flying dutchman. keep it down will ya. i'm trying to get some sleep. mr. krabs: all for one. spongebob and patrick: and one for all.  flying dutchman: who dug up the dutchman's treasure. mr. krabs:  they did. flying dutchman: arrgh. so you two scallywags dug up me treasure.. spongebob and patrick: uhhuh. flying dutchman: well, you saved me a lot of diggin' you did. so here's an reward for the two of ya's. spongebob: wow. female singers: two gold doubloons. mr. krabs: wait. i'm captain of this crew. where's my reward. flying dutchman: hmmm, i guess you're right. a little something for your trouble.  mr. krabs: gold, gold, gold, gold, gold. huh. why, it's just a little plastic treasure chest. female singers: plastic. flying dutchman: aye, but it's based on a real treasure chest.  patrick: gee mr. krabs, you're looking all sweaty again.  ) )
