mr. krabs: what better way to spend an afternoon than trolling the sea vent for spare change.  whooh.  there's got to be a small fortune than discarded paperclips in there.  i knew this place looked familiar.  what's this. goodness, that must be sandy's treedome dwelling, and inside looks to be the largest soybean i have ever layed me eyestocks on. now this bears getting a closer look.  good afternoon, miss sandy. sandy: and good afternoon to you mr. krabs. what brings you out to this fine neck of the woods. mr. krabs: well uh, i just happen to be in the neighborhood and was wondering if you could see you in clear and grace me with a comprehensive tour of your homesweet treedome.  i hear the giant soybean is lovely this time of the year. sandy: sure, lets get you fitted with a helmet. mr. krabs: don't bother yourself. as long as i keep me ole lungs moist, i can breath your fancy air all day long. sandy: come on in then.   mr. krabs: seems so much bigger once your inside. sandy: that's what they all say. did i already show you my single wheeled roller skate or my helicopter that is powered by coconut milk. mr. krabs: huh. oh yeah, that sounds interesting sandy, but uh actually... sandy:  or my artificial intelligence that comes in the form of a multicolored cubeshaped puzzle. see it can solve itself.  mr. krabs: uh sandy, actually i'm not interested in all of that. sandy: okay, well was there something particular you wanted to see. mr. krabs: tell me about your giant soybean.  sandy: this is the result of an experimental growth serum i develop. it could easily feed a lot of hungry people. mr. krabs:  or a supply of entire rest.  sandy: once the testing is complete, the growth serum could be used to do a lot of good things. mr. krabs:  sandy: sure would hate to see it fallen into the wrong hands. someone who might just use it to try and get mr. krabs: rich. i'll be rich. sandy: what's that, mr. krabs. mr. krabs: uh, could i borrow your telephone.  heh, it's ringing. spongebob:  mr. krabs, i came as soon as i got the call. mr. krabs:  uh, did you bring a krabby patty like i was planning to ask you to do. spongebob:  aye aye, captain. mr. krabs: perfect. ok sandy, administer the growth serum. sandy: i don't know, mr. krabs. i can't predict what's going to happen. mr. krabs: well, you did say it needs further testing. test it on the krabby patty. sandy: well i suppose so. but only a single drop. mr. krabs: fair enough.  is it suppose to smell like that. sandy: if you two will excuse me, i need to pay a quick visit to a little squirrel's room.  would you mind holding these while i'm gone. i'll only be a minute. mr. krabs:  oh no, we don't mind.  heh heh heh, there. spongebob: but sandy said mr. krabs:  sh sh sh sh sh sh sh.  thanks for the tour sandy, see you later.   mr. krabs: eh, that patty didn't look like it's growing to me. pfft, growth serum. wasted a perfectly krabby patty would blemy.  spongebob: mr. krabs. mr. krabs:

fish:  it's a krabalanche.  mr. krabs: hold it. and just what is it you two think you're doing. squidward: the restaurant's being invaded by a 300 foot uncooked menu item. we're getting outta here. mr. krabs: whoa ho, this is a dream come true. you can't just leave. squidward: oh, do you have a better idea. mr. krabs: stay.... and work. squidward: okay, you go right ahead. but i'd rather stay alive than stay at work. that means you mr. krabs: cashy.  spongebob: mr. krabs, look out. mr. krabs: aaah.  squidward:  i think it's our break time, don't you.  plankton:  what's this.  krabs is cooking up some new scheme to undermine the success of his biggest competitor. me..  ah, i'd better get a closer look.   out of my way, you fools. spongebob:  plankton, you're going the wrong way.
