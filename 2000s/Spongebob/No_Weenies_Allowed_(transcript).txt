miracle worker.  spongebob: afternoon, reg. reg: whoa, whoa, little man. you still can't go in. spongebob: well, that makes me pretty mad. reg: oh yeah. spongebob: yeah. i might have to beat someone up just to get rid of all this blind fury. reg:  wow. spongebob: yeah, i feel pretty sorry for the next guy who looks at me funny. reg: hmmm... what about that guy.  spongebob:  i, uhh...  don't be silly. he's not botherin' anybody. i mean, not like... that guy.  patrick: who, me.  spongebob: yeah, you. standing there all smiling and whatnot. somebody oughta teach you some manners. patrick: okay, but i must warn you. i happen to be a world championship... uhh...  ...kick boxer.  spongebob: i don't care if you're the demon seed of davy jones. you're goin' down, tubby.  patrick: tubby.
