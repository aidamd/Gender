squidward: that's telling them. mr. krabs: grr. i better get to the bottom of this.  ah. a new store.  on my block. taking my customers.  pearl.  me own flesh and blood. how could you do this to your papa. pearl: what are you talking about, dad. mr. krabs: i'm talking about this.  pearl: once you taste the secret goodness of a kelpshake...  you can't have just one. mr. krabs: let me see that.  pearl: buy your own. mr. krabs: why i wouldn't give them a cent. pearl: i feel sorry for you. mr. krabs: then you do understand.  pearl: dad, you're embarrassing me.  oh, get away.  mr. krabs: oh, no. confound you, new kelpshake store. what's your secret.  of course. plankton, i bet he's behind this. aha. i knew you were behind this. plankton: pardon me, i've done nothing wrong. mr. krabs: then how do you explain this.  plankton: holy moley, how'd that happen. mr. krabs: don't try that with me, plankton. this new store is ruining me business. plankton: really.. wait a minute. that's my job.  blast it. it's bad enough i have to compete with this joker. now there's this.. kelpshakes. mr. krabs: wow. i guess you're really not behind this after all. plankton, they have... a secret formula. plankton: no, not another secret. and if there's a secret, i want to know about it.  mr. krabs: oh. plankton:  they're multiplying. why, they're on every corner. mr. krabs: block after block. plankton: they're everywhere. mr. krabs:  we've got to do something about this.  you sure this is going to work. plankton: just stick to the plan. mr. krabs:  oh, let's see, let's see. ah, there you are.  plankton, i think i found the kitchen. plankton: let's do this thing. mr. krabs: here goes. wachoo.  i'm sorry, i have a bit of a  ahahahahah...choo..  employee: eww.  plankton:  my eye, my eye, my eye.  mr. krabs: i think we lost them. well, you got any more bright ideas. plankton: of course i do.  mr. krabs: all set, plankton. plankton: you better believe it. this highpowered mechanical bioarm i invented should pry those restaurant doors open nice and easy.  what the barnacles. come on, you piece of garbage.  ouch. uncle. uncle. mr. krabs:  if you want anything done right, you've got to do it yourself.  oh, me back.  plankton:  krabs, pipe down. you're gonna soil our plans if you wake up the watchdog.  mr. krabs: never mind that. what about spongebob. spongebob: hi, mr krabs. hi...plankton. uh, mr krabs, i'm a little confused. don't you and plankton hate each other. mr. krabs: of course we do. spongebob: then why is he in your fist.  mr. krabs: uh...we've gone into business together. you see, spongebob, we were hired, uh...to fix this door. plankton: now we have to fix the roof.  mr. krabs: that's right. that's right. we have to fix the roof. it's, it's, it's leaking.  spongebob: well, good luck with that. see ya.  plankton: keep her going, krabs. at this rate, we'll have the kelpshake's recipe faster than you can say...  speaker: you have three seconds before spontaneous combustion.  plankton: let's beat it. mr. krabs: no kidding.  plankton: wait, you forgotten...  i'm throwing in the towel, krabs. all these convoluted plans are getting us nowhere. and to top it all off, i'm the only one that's taking the heat. mr. krabs: what's that suppose to mean. plankton: i don't see you on the front lines. sure, let me do all the work, while you just sit back like the fat gorilla you are.. mr. krabs:  who you are calling a gorilla, you onecent, oneeyed bottomfeeder.. spongebob: mr krabs, if you want a kelpshake, why don't you just buy one.  mr. krabs: buy one.  customer: i'll have one kelpshake, please. mr. krabs: i don't know about this, plankton. plankton: it's easy. just smile and hand the cashier the money. cashier: can i help you. plankton: good luck. mr. krabs: hi there. uh, could i get one kelpshake. cashier: sure, that'll be one dollar. mr. krabs: uh, ok.  cashier:  thank you.  sir, please let go of the bill. plankton: release your grip, man. do it.  cashier: enjoy. mr. krabs: thanks.  i can't believe we did it. plankton: oh, believe it, krabs. now let's get to the lab and find out what this stuff is made of.  what's the secret ingredient, karen. karen: well, it appears that the main ingredient is, kelp juice. plankton & mr. krabs: just kelp juice. mr. krabs: and to think this whole time i could've been selling these meself. plankton: you. what about me. if anyone, i deserve to make a buck of selling this stuff. mr. krabs:  no way, pipsqueak. this gold mine is mine. plankton: not if i can help it.  ow. mr. krabs:  nice try.  karen: i wouldn't do that if i were you. there's another ingredient. mr. krabs: hey, i paid good money for this thing. of course i'm gonna drink it.  what the.... i don't get what the big deal is. this tastes like a wet gym sock. plankton: really. let me try that.  actually, there is a bit of a pungent aftertaste. mr. krabs: hmmm.  hey, you're right. this ain't half bad.  this is amazing. plankton: well, don't be selfish.  oh yeah. karen: oh no. plankton:  krabs, we're all out of juice. mr. krabs: well, we gotta get more. karen: you're making a big mistake. mr. krabs: ah, phooey. you don't know what you're talking about.  kelpshake, kelpshake. oh how i love a kelpshake. spongebob:  what's happening to me.  they've shutdown the kelpshake restaurants.  plankton & mr. krabs: huh.  hazmat #1: it'll take decades to clean this hazardous material up. hazmat #2: i sure do feel sorry for whoever drank this.  plankton: look at us. mr. krabs: now what are we going to do. plankton: i don't know about you,  but i'm going back to what i do best. stealing your recipe.  mr. krabs: hey, wait a minute. plankton. plankton:  come to papa.  mr. krabs: hold it right there. you're not going anywhere... without a ten second head start. plankton: it's good to be home. mr. krabs: you said it. plankton:  i love being hated. mr. krabs: hey, get back here you little booger.  ) )
