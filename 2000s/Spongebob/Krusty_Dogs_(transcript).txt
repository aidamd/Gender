inspire you to stay in school, billy. billy:  spongebob:  mr. krabs. mr. krabs: ahoy spongebob. how's go the wieners. spongebob: eh, i was kinda wondering could we just go back to selling krabby

band for a return to a simpler time. a krabby pattier time.  female customer: i'm not really conceded about possible illhealth effects. what about you guys. customer #1: eh. customer #2: what about nostalgia. female customer: never heard of it.  spongebob: okay, that didn't work at all. squidward: it only seems to have increased their appetite for wieners. spongebob: we need stronger tactics.
