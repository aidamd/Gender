 unappetizing. disgusting excuse for a sandwich, that has ever been my displeasure to have slither down my throat. spongebob: but squidward:  and i curse this krabby patty, and all who enjoy them, to an early and welldeserved grave.  get it. spongebob: but, it doesn't make any sense. the krabby patty is an absolute good. nobody is immune to its tasty charms. squidward: nobody but me. spongebob:

a kelp bun,  with with extra sea pickles and, and burn it to a crisp, okay. spongebob: coming right up.  listen, squidward. i want to apologize for before. i was only trying to make you happy.  but i guess deep down inside, i was trying to make myself happy, but now i've learned there's room for all kinds of people in this crazy old  ...and they all don't have to like the same things.  squidward: don't go... spongebob: ...and while i strongly disagree with your decision, i accept it.  you know, it's not often i get to make one like this. i want to see the look on their face when they take that first bite.  triple krabby supreme. triple krabby supreme. did somebody order a triple krabby supreme. huh, they must've left. squidward: well, why don't you just, uh, leave it out here, in case they come back. spongebob: noooope, a patty this special should be eaten fresh, and... well... i haven't had one of these babies in over twenty minutes, so...  well, whoever they were, they had great taste.  ahh, they don't know what they're missing. well, back to work.  squidward: what do i have to do. eat one out of the garbage.  frank: i wish i could eat this, but i'm so darn full. oh well.  squidward: i had to say garbage... but, okay.  spongebob: oh no, what's this doing here.. this patty should be cremated.  i know you didn't like him, but... it means so much that you came. , having a child with the patty, and growing old with it. dream sequence ends] squidward: hmm, honey...  what. oh... i have got to get my hands on a krabby patty. and no one's gonna stop me.  there it is.
