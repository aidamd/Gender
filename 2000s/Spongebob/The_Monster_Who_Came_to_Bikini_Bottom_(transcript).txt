home. patrick: and this is my home. spongebob: where is your home. oh, maybe he doesn't have a home. patrick: doesn't have a home.  hey, wait a minute, you can live under my rock if you want, rarrg.

squidward, you're home early.  cop: hold it, buddy. where are you going. squidward: i live here.  and what's so funny. cop: oh, the thought of anyone living in a pile of gravel. squidward: i'll have you know, sir, that my home is apile of gravel..  cop: sir, don't yell at me. we don't want to alert the squidward: alert the what. cop: that big, scary monster inside the fence over there.  spongebob: he waved at you, squidward. that means he likes you. squidward: he likes me. officer, arrest me right now, because i am about to throw a horrible tantrum that no one around here wants to see.  cop #2: what do you think he's doing up there. cop #3: who. cop #2: the big guy. cop #3: i don't know. cop #2: what. cop #3: i said i don't know. cop #2:  cop #3: he's escaped. cop #2: quick,

the magazine stand. hold it right there, bub.  this is a newsstand, not a library.  okay, one more step, and i'll sneeze.  patrick: wait just one minute. this is my friend. if you want to get to him, you're gonna have to go through me. cop #2: we're prepared to do that. patrick: actually... just let me to talk to him for a minute. psst.  cop #2: you mean, that thing can speak. patrick:  of course. he's a giant freak of nature, not a freak of nature that can't speak.  and so as the lowly snail sheddeth his shell, and the lofty gull moldeth his feathers, the brightest of friendships must dimmeth as the setting sun. cop #2: that was...  beautiful. we still gotta run him out of town.  patrick: it really crushes my heart to see him go. spongebob: yeah, crushes. patrick, "crushes"that gives me an idea.  patrick:  yeah. okay.  two cubes, please.  spongebob:  your ice cubes, sir. nat: what. where.  hey, thanks buddy. spongebob: don't thank me. thank raarg. ) )
