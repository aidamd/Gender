patchy: that's it. that's the lost episode. that was just a bunch of cheap walk cycles. potty: what a rip. patchy: grrrrr...  spongebob betrayed us..  i'm sorry i ever started this stupid fan club in the first place.  i'm gonna get rid of all my spongebob stuff. all of it. all of it.  all of it.  i'm gonna run away, that's what i'll do. run away.  potty: sheesh, what a hothead. announcer:  and now, the real lost episode. potty: brawk. patchy, come back. there's more. patchy:  really.  hooray. let's watch.  french narrator: here we see the proud jellyfish hunter.  he stands motionless to lure the jellyfish into a false sense of security.  and when his prey ventures to close, he springs into action. spongebob:  huh.   ooh.  phew. i salute you, oh majestic jellyfish.  your command of the sky is unmatched. floating just out of the reach of my net, but near enough that i can see your untamed beauty.  .if only i could join you there in the air. floating free without a care. i wish i could fly. and see things with a different eye..  .i would fly so very high and touch the sky..  .and never have to ask why it is that i can't fly.  wait a minute, i'm forgetting the words of grandpa squarepants.  grandpa squarepants: if we were meant to fly, we'd have propellers on our heads or jet engines on our backs.  spongebob:  i'm gonna follow his advice, by gum. i'll invent a flying machine.  patrick: what's that contraption, spongebob. spongebob: that, patrick, is a flying machine. patrick:  spongebob: what's so funny. patrick: well, it's like my grandpa used to say.  grandpa squarepants: if we were meant to fly, uh... hey, i'm not your grandfather.  spongebob: well, here i go, patrick.  i'm off to fly with the jellyfish. ignition, check.  landing gear...  check. complimentary peanuts...  checkaroo.  ready for takeoff.  patrick: you cut a hole in farmer jenkins' grain silo. spongebob: don't remind me. jenkins:  i knew no good would come from city folk and their flying machines. now git.  patrick: we better do what he says. he knows how to grow food.  spongebob: well, it took me all night, but here they are. the new blueprints. i wasn't even close with that last one. propellers, rudders...  this one's gonna fly.  i can feel it. ready, patrick. patrick:  ready. spongebob:  it's working, patrick. i'm flying. i'm...  falling.  ooh.  spongebob: this is it, patrick. the physics are all here. this time, i'm gonna fly.  patrick: oh boy, a birthday party. spongebob:  no, patrick. this is the squarepants flyer mark three.  all you do is remove the brick, or ballast, and...  huh.  well, back to the drawing board. patrick: can we have the cake now.  happy, happy birthday to you.  spongebob: patrick, get ready to say "eureka." patrick: okay. spongebob: go.  it's working. i'm flying.  cap fish: hey. look at that guy tied to a kite. fred: why's he doing that. nancy: oh my goodness... fred: why's he doing that. cap fish: he'll fall and break his... nancy: can you see from up there. spongebob: do not be afraid, earthbound people. i am not a flying monster, i am just one of you.  d'oh.  ow. patrick. ow. patrick. ow. patrick. ow. patrick.  excuse me, sir, but i would like to return this kite. vendor: hey... i know you. yeah, from today's paper.  spongebob: "local nutcase tries to fly".. i'm a nutcase because i follow my dreams. well, they laughed at the guy who invented light bulbs too. vendor: no they didn't. spongebob:  you'll see.  monroe: look mom, it's the bird man of bikini bottom. mable: wow. i wonder why he's still using his legs. monroe: come on, bird man. flap your wings and fly.  cap fish: hey, bird man, going to check on your eggs. nancy: maybe he's looking for a statue to poop on. fred:  spongebob: go on and laugh, but it is a sad day in bikini bottom when a guy is ridiculed for having dreams.  mother #2: you think you're the only one with unfulfilled dreams. stubble fish: i was supposed to be a concert pianist... until i realized i didn't have any fingers.  nat: we all had dreams. nancy: what makes you so special.  mob: let's get him. spongebob:  huh.  nat: good riddance, dreamer.  spongebob:  ooh.  well, it can't get any worse. d'oh.  i guess i spoke too soon. french narrator:   will spongebob learn to fly. stay tuned.   spongebob: there they go again, gary.  i suppose i'll never join them in the sky. i'll be stuck on the ground, sentenced to a flightless life.  oh well. i guess all dreams aren't meant to come true.  back to reality.  gary: meow. spongebob: no, gary, my dreams are silly.  hello. no, this isn't the bird man of bikini bottom. what.  no, i certainly do not live in a birdcage. who is this. joe momma. well, listen up, joe.  i hate to break it to you, but flying is impossible.  i have to go now. my head just hit the ceiling. huh. hey. look, gary.  i... i think i'm flying. jellyfish fields, here i come.  monroe:  mom, look. it's the flying guy. mable: wow, i guess he wasn't a lunatic after all. spongebob:  .i'm flying. i'm flying.. citizens:  .he's flying..  .he's flying..  .he's really, really flying..  spongebob: .they laughed, they scoffed, before i had liftoff.. citizens:  .but now he's flying..  .he's flying high in the sky..  spongebob: .i'd love to hang around to say i told you so..  .but it's off to jellyfish fields i go..  .roads and streets are not for me..  mrs. puff: .help. please help. my snail is up a tree. i've had her since i was a little girl..  .but now it looks like the end of her world..  no. spongebob:  gotcha.  next time, try the elevator.  mrs. puff: thank you, bird man. spongebob:  .i have never felt so free..  .high in the sky is the place for me..  .helping friends from up above..  .these are the things that i love..  .i'll help mr. krabs reclaim his dime.. mr. krabs: i'm rich.  spongebob: .and i'll save patrick from this mime.. patrick: thanks, buddy. spongebob:  .even plankton needs some help, when he gets tangled in the kehehhehhehhehhehhehhehhehhehhehhehhehelllllllp..  plankton: please put me down.  fish head: all of bikini bottom is abuzz over the identity of a mysterious flying man who helps people.  tom: he found my hair piece.  tyler: he helps people... and he flies... and he helps people. fish head:  who knows what superhero act of courage he'll astound us with next.  nat: oh no. the light in the goo lagoon lighthouse went out, and sailor jenkins is headed for the coastline. jenkins:  i'm glad i gave up farming. spongebob:  i'm coming.  nat: thanks, mysterious flying man. jenkins:  i knew no good would come from city folk and their flying machines. spongebob:  that's enough good deeds for one day. i've got a date with a flock of jellyfish. mr. krabs:  spongebob. son. i need you and your magical pants. spongebob: but mr. krabs, i invented these pants so i could fly with the jellyfish. if i keep doing favors for people i'll never make my dreams a reality.  mr. krabs: but spongebob, it's an emergency. spongebob:  let's roll.  where to, mr. k. mr. krabs: uh... my garage. spongebob: you've got it.  what's the emergency, mr. krabs. mr. krabs: are you sure you're up for it, boy. spongebob: i think my pants can handle it. mr. krabs: i need you... spongebob:  yes. mr. krabs: to clean... spongebob: clean up crime. mr. krabs: my garage. spongebob:  that's your emergency. mr. krabs: but spongebob, everyone knows it's easier to clean a garage when you can fly. spongebob:  all right, mr. krabs. i'll clean your garage. but after this, no more favors.  all done, mr. krabs. mr. krabs:  and the recyclables. spongebob: aw, shrimp.  finally. jellyfish fields, here i come. patrick:  spongebob. spongebob: patrick's in trouble. patrick:  spongebob. spongebob. spongebob:  what is it, buddy. patrick: will you scratch my tummy.  ah...  larry: help me pick out a tie.  squidward: clean my bathtub.  mrs. puff: balance my checkbook.  plankton: help spread the word of evil.  hat fish: untangle my phone chords. cap fish: do my geometry. nancy: talk to my plants. gray fish: rub my scalp.  mmm... oh yeah. spongebob:  wait a minute. wait a minute. wait a minute. i'm supposed to be at jellyfish fields right now. but instead, i'm rubbing your scalp. and i don't even know who you are. gray fish: but, we went to elementary school together. spongebob: dennis.  dennis: mmm... oh yeah.  cap fish: spongebob. monroe: hey spongebob. fred: spongebob. spongebob:  if i don't give these feverish favorseekers the slip, i'll never get to fly with the jellyfish.  monroe: hey. there he is. spongebob:  monroe: he's getting away. light purple fish: no. he owes us favors. monroe: get him.  spongebob: i'm almost at jellyfish fields. i'm gonna make it. nat: he's headed for jellyfish fields. we'll never catch him now. jenkins:  i'll take care of this. crowd: it's cannonball jenkins. jenkins:  i told you nothing good would come from city folk and their flying machines.  fred: what have we done.  come on, everybody. i think a proper burial is in order.  a pair of pants like these come around... once in a lifetime.  spongebob: well, it was fun while it lasted.  i guess i'm not meant to fly after all.  huh. hey. my jellyfish friends are helping me fly. without pants. i guess it just goes to show...  .you don't need a plane to fly.  .plastic wings may make you cry.  .kites are made for windy days. lawn chair with balloons... fly away.  .inflatable pants... you may as well skip..  .if you want to fly, all you need... is friendship. yeah..  goodbye, jellies. you taught me a valuable lesson. although i'm not quite sure what it was. patrick:  hey. let's fly down to the pizza house for a slice. spongebob: no more flying for me, patrick. i'll leave that to the jellyfish.  patrick: suit yourself.  spongebob:  did patrick just....  nah.  patchy: wow. wasn't that great, kids. potty: let's watch it again. patchy:  that's a great idea, potty.  where's the remote.  where's the remote.  oh, i lost the remote. they should make those things...  eh...  potty: brawk. patchy:  my remote.  thanks, stranger. mrs. johnson:  don't mention it, patchy.  patchy: now, which one of these cockamamie buttons is rewind.  no, that's not it.  d'oh. wrong again.  potty: brawk. let me do it. patchy: no, get away.  that's the light switch. give me that.  potty: brawk. that's the mariachi band button. patchy: grrrrr... i hate technology.. patchy:  rewind... darn you.  potty: brawk. failure ahoy. patchy: no.  dah. dah. oh, blasted infernal machine.  oh no. i've ruined the lost episode. now it's lost forever. potty: brawk. lost forever. french narrator: oh boy, what a loser. well, i guess the lost episode will remain lost. but, tape or no tape, as long as there are stars in the sky, spongebob will live on in our hearts and in our minds.  now get lost. i mean, bye. no, really, get lost. ) )
