mr. krabs:   and how is everything for you today, sir. nat: oh, it's great. just great. mr. krabs: fine, fine. nat: i just love this krabby patty. mr. krabs: yeah, okay, always nice to hear.  nat: my krabby patty is a krabby patty and both buns are also krabby patties.  so luxurious. mr. krabs:  you must've paid five times the price of a regular patty for that. nat: no extra. it's the same low price as a regular krabby patty. mr. krabs:  argh.  me eyes. what are you doing, mr. squidward..  squidward: i couldn't find a smelling salt, so i just used table salt. fred: hey, my krabby patty is just a bun. and the two buns... are also buns. stale buns. tom:  my patty tastes like sadness. mr. krabs: all right, that's enough. patties with emotional flavors...  ...it's two bits extra. now pay at the register. what in davy jones' locker is going on in here, mr. squidward.. squidward: what do you think. spongebob's in one of his moods. he failed his boating exam...again. mr. krabs: well, we can't have that. he's me best employee. well, no offence. squidward: none taken. mr. krabs: melancholy and selfdoubt are bad for business. make a note of it. squidward: let me grab a pencil.  ha, it's funny, cause i mean the opposite. ha.  mr. krabs:  avast there, lad.  you're wasting your valuable tears, salting me patties with grief. spongebob: i'm sorry, mr. krabs.  oh, i can't even cry right.  mr. krabs: there, there. failing your driver's test is nothing to cry over. spongebob: oh, i've been in driving school as long as i can remember, and i still don't have my license. mr. krabs: how much do they charge you at this driving school of yours. spongebob:  oh, about $100 a semester. mr. krabs: $100 a semester..  well, i can do it for double the price and half the time. spongebob:  really. mr. krabs: sure, i taught me own daughter pearl how to drive like a little angel.  pearl: hi, daddy. i need money for shoes. mr. krabs: sure, anything for me little angel pearl. pearl: thanks, daddy.  spongebob: uh, are you sure about this, mr. krabs. mr. krabs:  why, i couldn't be sure, lad. you don't need a...  "professional"to teach you how to drive. spongebob: you know, mr. krabs, at boating school, mrs. puff... mr. krabs: wipe that boating school malarkey out of your mind, son. it's all a racket. spongebob:  it is. mr. krabs:  and that goes for every kind of schooling. why, there ain't nothing truly important, you can't learn on the streets with half a jigger of common sense and your own two claws. now, put 'er in gear. spongebob:  okay.  mr. krabs:  well, rookie mistake, boy. it happens all the time. spongebob: it does. mr. krabs: no, but you got the right fire in your belly. spongebob: i do. mr. krabs:  yeah. well, you know, what we need is a change of venue.  mr. krabs: this empty parking lot is just the ticket.  like every young person, the novice boater needs plenty of open, obstaclefree space and the freedom to make mistakes.  spongebob: mr. krabs, you're so wise. mr. krabs:  can't disagree with you there. all right, put 'er in gear.  hmm. spongebob: rookie mistake, right. mr. krabs: i suppose so. now slowly inch forward and we'll check out the damage. spongebob: inch, inch. inch, inch, inch. inch, inch.  mr. krabs:  oh, broken wall. that's about $15,000. oh, kitchen fire. oh, that'll be about 6 grand.  ooh, lawsuit. oh, that's a lot of zeroes. ugh.   all right, krabs. get a hold of yourself. you've been in worse fixes than this. why, you've stared down the cannon's mouth, haven't ya. look at that face.  bleah. is this the face of your final defeat. is it, krabs.   mr. krabs: now, here's a place you should be comfortable with. spongebob: oh, i'll say. mr. krabs: just take a look around, boyo: home sweet home. nothing to make you twitchy and jumpy. oh, just the opposite, in fact. a place so soothing and sweet, like a mother's gentle lullaby on a soft summer's night.  oh, brother. let's start with something simple: a little trip down the street to patrick's house.  spongebob: patrick's house.  harv:  i'll have one krabby patty, please. squidward: okay. mr. krabs: upsell. squidward:   would you like fries with that. harv: yeah, sounds good. mr. krabs:  better.  mr. krabs: okay, that was just fine, but next time, wait until i say, "put 'er into gear." squidward: you missed one.  mr. krabs:  a simple trip to patrick's house: a line so straight and true. spongebob: mr. krabs, let's just leave the boat here and walk. mr. krabs: well, we, you know, we could do that. but you can't learn to drive without a boat. or can ye.  mr. krabs: you'll certainly learn the way of the boat with this here topoftheline, stateoftheart technological simulator.  mr. krabs: now hand me one of them tokens. you'll need your protective headgear. computer on screen: ready. drive.  spongebob: i'm doing it, mr. krabs. i'm driving the boat. uhoh. computer on screen: sixth place.  spongebob: hey, look, mr. krabs. i'm driving. mr. krabs: great job, boy.   worker: phew.   spongebob: well, at least i didn't hit the krusty krab that time.   mr. krabs: saw that coming.  spongebob: i'm sorry, mr. krabs. the fire in my belly has gone... ] mr. krabs: no, no. it's my fault. we've been going about this all wrong, boy. it's not a pampering you'd be needing. it's a bold and reckless display of confidence. spongebob: oh, yeah. mr. krabs: you think when i was your age, i tiptoed around like a tadpole on a petunia. spongebob: you never. mr. krabs: that's right. my style was to dive in with both feet, claws snapping.  spongebob:  snapping.  spongebob: oh, my gosh. mr. krabs: thar she blows. the dreaded double roundabout, the most treacherous stretch of road in all of bikini bottom. to your starboard, you yield. to your port, they yield to you. and when you're in the middle, it's every man for himself and the devil take the rest. spongebob:  man, i don't think i'm ready for this, mr. krabs. mr. krabs:  nonsense, boyo. all it takes is some confidence and a little coordination. why, your little pet snail could do it.  gary: meow. spongebob: uh, i thought you were just using gary as a colorful example, mr. krabs. mr. krabs: oh, he's colorful, all right. but he's also going to teach you how to drive. now, go.  atta boy.  there you go, spongebob. did you see how gary did that. spongebob:  uh, yeah, some of it. mr. krabs: buck up, me boyo.  it's your turn next. spongebob:  my turn. gee, mr. krabs, you must really believe in me. mr. krabs:  not really.  police officer: sir, is this your vehicle. mr. krabs: why, yes. yes, officer, it is. police officer: and did i just see you let a snail negotiate this vehicle through a dangerous intersection. mr. krabs:  you sure did...uh, i mean, you didn't...i mean, well, no...i mean, well, yes...i mean, uh, look, it was just a friendly, little example: a colorful example.  i was teaching the lad to drive. police officer: by putting a snail behind the wheel. mr. krabs: well, i mean, really, he has more on top of the wheel. gary: meow. spongebob: officer, i don't have the boating handbook with me, but... mr. krabs:  quiet, boy. let me handle this. police officer: are you a licensed driving instructor, sir. mr. krabs:  well, no. but i taught me own little girl to drive, you see, and you understand. do you have any kiddies of your own at home, officer. police officer:  no, i'm married to my job. mr. krabs: oh. well, um...you two seem very happy together. police officer: well, we've had our ups and downs, but after some couples counseling, we think we've worked out our issues.  mr. krabs:  this ticket's coming out of your paycheck, boy. spongebob:  whoa. my first real traffic ticket. police officer:  oh, this is going to require something more than money, sir. mr. krabs: ha. what could be worse than spending money.   mrs. puff: all right, class. please say hello to our newest classmate...mr. krabs. class : hello, mr. krabs. spongebob:  don't worry, mr. k. i'll show you the ropes.  ) )
