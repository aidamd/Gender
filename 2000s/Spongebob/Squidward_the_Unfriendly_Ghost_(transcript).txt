today. he hath decided to spare ye a a horrible fate. all ye must do is tend to my every whim and tickle my fancy on demand. spongebob: does that include... squidward: quiet. now, do as you're told. lest ye incur the wrath of squidward. patrick:  i think they make a cream for that now.  spongebob: here. squidward: too hot.  spongebob: here. squidward: no, too wet. keep going. keep going.  spongebob: here. squidward: toulouselautrec.  spongebob: too tired...  squidward: perfect. hmmm, i feel needy.  slaves, fetcheth me some nourishment. spongebob: only the freshest, o spooky one.  a grape fresh from the vine, your ghostliness.  a banana peeled to your liking, your incorporealness.  patrick: one watermelon fresh from the manure field, your spookiness.  spongebob: art thou not pleased.  squidward: enough of that. i want something else to eat now. something that's very difficult to find. patrick: what do you hunger for, master. spongebob: whatever you want, we'll find it.

oh, my.  always having to have it our way, don't we. oh, boohoo.  spongebob: i can't do it.  squidward: well, i hope you don't have any plans tonight, because you're not allowed to leave that spot until i hear a song.  what's this. napping on the job. you're supposed to be making music for me. as punishment for this insolence, squidward's ghost commandeth you to clean out his back room. patrick:  i found it.  squidward: i'll take that.  patrick: yes, your ghostliness.  this is fun. spongebob: patrick, are you ready for this. patrick: yes.  spongebob: okay, let's go. patrick, are you coming.  patrick: yes. spongebob: patrick, it's this way. patrick: where. spongebob: here. patrick:  oh, coming.  how are we going to clean up all this mess. spongebob: it's easy. just tear this wallpaper off.  patrick:  oh look, you missed some.  spongebob: oh, let's see. it's a comic book, and look at this. it's the origin of the flying dutchman.  it says when he died they used his body as a window display. now he haunts the seven seas because he was never put to rest. well, don't you get it, patrick. patrick: we're going to go shopping. spongebob: no. we're gonna put poor old squidward to rest.  squidward: ow, what the heck was that. spongebob: initiation. that was part one of your ceremony. squidward: ceremony for what. spongebob: we're going to put you to rest. squidward: i don't want to be put to rest. all i want are those chores done. now, did you clean the back room yet. spongebob: yeah. squidward: well, i'm going to go check.  spongebob: okay, get in. squidward: are you crazy. i'm not getting in that thing. spongebob: but you said we could put you to rest. squidward: i didn't say anything like that. now, get out of my house.  squidward: now what.  spongebob: i wrote here lies squidward. you may not remember him, but...  oh, hi squidward. does this look deep enough. squidward: spongebob.  cut that out. spongebob: oh, look, the mourners have arrived.  mr. krabs: oh, squidward, we all came as soon as we were sure you were dead. squidward: spongebob, are you trying to put me in the nuthouse. spongebob: no, just into this hole.  squidward: spongebob, i have a confession to make.  spongebob: you're bald. squidward: no, i'm not bald. i'm alive. now get rid of that tombstone and tell all your friends to go home. spongebob: but squidward: do it. spongebob: go home.  but master squidward: i'm not your master, i'm your neighbor. now do me a favor and please stop doing me favors.  spongebob: as you wish, master. squidward: d'oh. patrick: boy, he really had us fooled. spongebob: no, patrick, he's the fool. he's a ghost in denial. he needs us now more than ever. patrick: you're right. he really needs to get up to the great beyond. spongebob: patrick, say that again. patrick: that again. spongebob: no, the other thing. patrick: no, the other thing. spongebob: no, what you said before when you... patrick: no, what you said before when you.. spongebob: never mind. i've got an idea. patrick: never mind. i've got an idea.  spongebob: i can't reach him. patrick: blow harder.  there he goes. spongebob: isn't he beautiful. patrick: how high's he going to go.  spongebob: all the way, patrick, up to the great beyond.  goodbye, friend. patrick: happy trails.  spongebob & patrick: you're welcome. spongebob: he's on the other side now. patrick: yeah.  he's in a better place.  ) )
