squidward: ah, but did you clean down to the subatomic particles. spongebob:  i knew i missed something.  spongebob: done. even the theoretical particles are clean. theoretically.  squidward:  i don't know. why don't you just, i don't know, see how many things you can flush down the toilet. spongebob:  um... are you sure about that boss. squidward: are you questioning my orders. spongebob: i hear and obey my liege.  squidward: ahh.. what have i done..  spongebob: how am i doing boss.  squidward: this is a completely irresponsible thing to do.  but i must admit, it looks amazing.  spongebob: how about this.  squidward: and try this.  squidward: here they go.  spongebob: this will go down good.  oops.  squidward: that was funny. it almost looked like mr. krabs' safe. you know. the one with the secret krabby patty formula inside. spongebob:  what's really funny is that it was mr. krabs' safe. the one with the... both: secret krabby patty formula inside...  squidward: how could you. spongebob: you ordered me too. squidward: i didn't say the safe. spongebob: you didn't say "not the safe". squidward: well, i order you to go get it... spongebob: one second.  employees must wash hands before leaving.  squidward: what have i done. i flushed spongebob down a toilet. why that's despicable. even for me.  squidward: alright. as soon as i get the fry cook out of the toilet, you can all have your krabby patties.  squidward: eew.. yuck. it's so unsanitary. can't believe i'm doing this.  mr. krabs:  ow. crupski: krabs, you old bag of shells. you're not gonna regret paying that money to have your name on this stadium for you. mr. krabs: i sure hope you're right. crupski: krabs, i like you to meet charlton hawkfish, the famous sewer architect. charlton hawkfish: i designed every pipe, gasket, and cesspit beneath this stadium. mr. krabs:  uh, hi.  frank: you know, that was weird. i had to flush the toilet twice. sandals: and they call this place a modern marble. charlton hawkfish: crupski, you told me you wouldn't cut corners on my plans.  charlton hawkfish: what's this.  you've added the reducer into a fivefoot main line. crupski: your point being. charlton hawkfish: that pipe's to small. it'll never hold. crupski: relax, charlton. building it cheap saved a lot of money. mr. krabs: ooh. i like that. charlton hawkfish: and what's this. the pipe is made out of cardboard.. crupski: in corrugated cardboard. mr. krabs: ah, relax. that's what my grandma's dentures are made of.  squidward: spongebob. are you down here.  spongebob: hiya, squidward. squidward:  do not touch me. i am way out of my comfort zone.  squidward: alright, you've been down here longer than me. which way.  spongebob: pull my finger.  spongebob: that way. squidward: figures.  spongebob:  sewer, sewer. chachacha. sewer, sewer. chachacha. sewer, sewer. chachacha.  spongebob: look at these strange etchings, squidward. squidward: look like snakes. spongebob: i hope we don't run into anything like that down here.  spongebob: hey. over there.  spongebob: it's stuck on the pipe. squidward: we need to get up there.  spongebob:  sewer, sewer. chachacha. squidward: there it is.  squidward: darn it. i missed again.  squidward: ahh... leapin' lampreys. they're biting me. spongebob: well, bite 'em back.  squidward: ahh. ahh. my eyes.  spongebob: hey, look. there's the safe. squidward: where. where.  spongebob: there it is.  spongebob:  o sole mio. squidward: silencio.  spongebob: yay. whoo hoo.  squidward: what the.  both: sewer snake.  charlton hawkfish:  it's five minutes 'til halftime. do you know what that means. mr. krabs: hehheh. sure do. the bikini bottom mets. charlton hawkfish: the halftime wave man. when every toilet flushes at once, the sewers can't take it. it's madness.  mr. krabs: ok. but you're gonna miss the cheer leaders.  squidward: in here.  spongebob:  ooh. look. you are here. squidward: why is the diagram shaped like a giant sewer snake with an arrow point to its stomach.  squidward: what are you doing.. spongebob: oh. crossing digested by a giant sewer snake off of my todo list.  squidward: oh. that makes sense.  squidward: snake food.  spongebob: good going, squidward. you're tickling him. i'll help ya.  spongebob: squidward, the safe. squidward. safe. squidward: don't bother me while i'm hysterical.  squidward: i'm alive. i'm alive. spongebob: i guess we're just lucky.  spongebob: oh, look. you found the safe. squidward: just my luck.  charlton hawkfish: egads.  charlton hawkfish: too much flushing. she's gonna blow.  how's she holding up. nat peterson: sir, every tunnel is flooded except for the reducer pipe.  charlton hawkfish: the pinch point. mr. krabs: hmm. is that bad.  spongebob and squidward: huh.  charlton hawkfish: gaskets blown, manifold mangled, backflow everywhere. crupski: oh, you're overacting. charlton hawkfish: you flushed it all away, crupski. you two better hope that fail safe i installed works.  food vendor: hot dogs. popcorn.  snorkels.  charlton hawkfish: good thing today was free axe day at the stadium.  charlton hawkfish: this is what you get when socalled fish kind and all its humorous and ignorance stooped so low.  as to cut corners and its plumbing system. extinction is the result of being cheap. mr. krabs: what a bunch of malarkey. charlton hawkfish: at least we didn't waken the great sewer snake.  check that.  sewer snake: uhoh.  squidward: hey, everybody. the cook's back from the toilet. spongebob: who's hungry.  ) )
