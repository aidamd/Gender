you, idiot.  pain.  okay, karen, fun is fun, but it's time to let me back in. come on, i really need to use the potty.  plankton: fine, i don't need you or the chum bucket. i got plenty of friends around here who would love to take me in.  plankton: so is it cool if i crash here. mr. krabs: no. plankton: then can i just use your bathroom.  spongebob: plankton, i know where this is going. i'd love it if you'd stay with me. plankton: are you crazy. you're the most annoying sponge in the sea. i wouldn't stay with you if you were the last person in bikini bottom.  spongebob: suit yourself.  plankton: okay, fine.   plankton: whew. much better. thanks for letting me use your bathroom. spongebob:  silly, that's not my bathroom. plankton: well, in that case, you're gonna need some new shoes. spongebob: oh, boy. does this mean you're gonna stay with me. plankton:  yes. spongebob: yeah.  we're gonna be the best roommates ever. oh. wanna do each other's hair.  plankton: oh, forget this.

out. plankton: threw me out. i threw her in.  spongebob: hey, this is your safe place. it's okay to talk about your feelings.  oh, somebody's tense. plankton: hey. what. get off. getoh.  oh, that's the spot. spongebob: now, tell spongebob why you and karen got into a fight. plankton: i don't know, i was just doing the same things i always do. spongebob: well, if karen threw you out for doing the same things you always do, maybe you should learn to not do the same things you always do. plankton: but i'm the best. spongebob: well, sometimes you can get a little...aggressive. plankton: me, aggressive.. how dare you..  maybe you're right. i can be a big jerk sometimes. i command you to help me be a nicer person.  i mean, will you please, please help me be a nicer person so karen will take me back. spongebob: plankton, in a word: yes.  plankton: what is that dimwit doing here. patrick: ahh. oh, behind me. oh, get away. plankton: will you stop that.. there's no one behind you. you're the dimwit. patrick: oh. thanks. spongebob: all right, plankton, the first step to becoming a nicer person is being thoughtful. try holding a door for someone. it's simple, and it makes people happy. like this.  after you. patrick:  i'm happy, spongebob.  can someone get me out of here.  whew. spongebob: all right, plankton. now you try. plankton: fine, but if he kisses me, i'm gonna lose it.  ugh. after you.  plankton: whoa.  spongebob: try this one. plankton:  after you. patrick: but i can't fit through there. plankton: how dare you reject my act of kindness. yah. patrick: ahh.  spongebob: plankton, no. patrick: can someone get me out of here.  spongebob: okay, plankton, since you don't seem to be able to do something nice, in this lesson you're going to learn to say something nice. plankton: easy. spongebob: great. so turn to patrick and say something nice.  plankton: uh...patrick, you're not a total moron. just half of one. spongebob: no, try again. plankton: fine. your color pink is not so repugnant. patrick: thanks. i like...um...your antennas. plankton: what. what's wrong with my antennas.. spongebob: plankton, patrick was complimenting you. plankton: yeah, right. you two are mocking me.  patrick: hey, spongebob. do you think this is working. spongebob: no, i think we better try something else.  plankton: it's no use, spongebob. i'm just too brilliant to be nice. i'll never get karen back now. spongebob: oh, yes, you will. we obviously can't fix your terrible insides, but maybe, just maybe, we can work on your terrible outsides. makeover time.  plankton: brother.  plankton:  forget it, spongebob. karen's the perfect woman: so smart, so conniving. ah, she's never gonna take me back. spongebob: oh, yes, she is. you just need to do something big. be vulnerable, be sweet. show karen your heart.  plankton: that's a great idea. i'll cook up a scheme to make her jealous and crush her spirit.  spongebob: that wasn't even close to what i said. plankton: sure it was. and i know just how to do it.  spongebob: okay, i feel uncomfortable.  spongebob: plankton, are you sure about this. plankton: of course i'm sure. now, start doing a robot voice. remember, you're not spongebob anymore. you're shelby naughtica. spongebob:  oh, i like that.  boop beep. beep boop boop. karen: welcome to the chum bucket.  oh. it's you. what do you

hey, you. get your hands off my man. spongebob: you better step off, lady. no one can make plankton happy like i can. we are soulmates, and we're going to get married and print 1,347 babies.  plankton: 1,000 what.. karen: oh, well, you're really in love. i won't stand in your way. plankton's all yours. spongebob: yeah. plankton: no. the whole point of this scheme was for me to get karen back, and now you're ruining it. spongebob:  sorry, plankton. you just said nice things to me. karen: wait a second. you're not just being a jerk. you mean, you cooked this whole stupid scheme up to win me back. plankton: of course i did.  i'd do anything for you, baby, even hang out with this moron. spongebob: oh, that is so sweet. karen: get over here, you.  plankton: eww, it's that fat screensaver again. karen:  what..  plankton: now, karen, take it easy. spongebob: i'm gonna go now.  karen: my motherboard was right about you. she warned me about you. and i should've listened to her.  ) )
