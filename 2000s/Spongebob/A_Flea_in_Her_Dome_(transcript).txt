sandy: looks... tasty, spongebob. spongebob:  are you okay, sandy. sandy: i'm fine. my skin just hasn't adjusted to this here underwater air.  spongebob: uh.. hey, sandy. sandy.  surprise.  patrick

me. sandy: 'cause he's hungry. when a flea bites you, it's 'cause he's sucking up your blood for nutrition. patrick: i've been bit by a vampire flea.  no.  i'm gonna turn into a vampire now.  it's already happening. ah, ah.  sandy: patrick  there ain't no such thing as vampires. patrick:  augh. doesn't matter.  oh, this itch is killing me. yagh.  sandy: aah. gimmie that.  phew.  spongebob:

better.  whoa. sandy: i do not play games.  quick. in the tree house. it's the only safe place left.  we should be protected here.  hold on.  spongebob: is this how we will spend the rest of our lives. living in fleas instead of water. sandy:  spongebob. that's it. water.  spongebob & patrick: water.  spongebob: it sure is good to have you back, sandy.  ) )
