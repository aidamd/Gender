me barnacle the way you put the run on them nematodes. spongebob:  yeah, i guess so. but then i was going to do karate with sandy. sandy: i know, but you saved the treedome. pretty cool, if you ask me. spongebob: well, i suppose. but then i was going to go jellyfishing with patrick. patrick: but then you... uh, what'd you do again. squidward: and, i hate to admit it, but i suppose if you hadn't fixed my reed, the concert would have been a bust. mr. krabs: you see, spongebob, it's not about you or your perfect day or any of those things. spongebob:  it's not. mr. krabs: no.  it's about us. spongebob: it is. mr. krabs: yep. and since you did such a good job, we wanna make it up to you. spongebob: you do. mr. krabs: so, just tell us anything your little heart desires, and it's yours.  ladies and gentlemen, tonight, the bikini bottom players proudly present a very expensive production of... "the best day ever." and it better be good for all it's costing me. spongebob: .my perfect job starts my perfect day..  .then it's time to kick back, relax and play..  mr. krabs: that wasn't in the budget. spongebob: .sing along. hear that happy sound. patrick: .don't let those sour notes bring you down.. squidward: hey. spongebob: .that's where it's at..  mr. krabs: i'm not paying for that. spongebob: .it's the best day ever. echo: .best day ever. spongebob: .it's the best day ever. echo: .best day ever. spongebob: .it's the best day ever. echo: .best day ever. spongebob: .it's the best day ever. echo: .best day ever. squidward: how long do we have to keep this up. mr. krabs: just till his little heart gives out, squidward. just till his little heart gives out. ) )
