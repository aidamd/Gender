chance and you failed. you have to stop living in the past. face it spongebob, you're only hurting yourself.  it's what gary wants, and what gary wants is me. right, gary.  he only liked me for my shorts. spongebob: no, patrick. he wanted the cookie in your pocket.  gary: meow. spongebob: gggary.  whee.  oh gary, i knew you'd never leave me. aww  let's go for a walk, pal.  patrick: gary. i
