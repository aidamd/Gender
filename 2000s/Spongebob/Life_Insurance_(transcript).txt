life insurance is really working.  patrick: i've become unbreakable.  squidward: why i do raise seahorses.  well, i don't know if i call myself international playboy.   squidward: just what are you two ignorami doing out here. spongebob: we're trying to hurt each other. patrick: ooh.  squidward:  patrick: you got a sea spider on your head. squidward: it's not a sea spider, you dope. it's... my hair. spongebob and patrick:  hmm...  squidward: wait a second. hurt each other. oh, i'm gonna enjoy seeing this.  squidward: stop, stop, stop. i thought you said you were trying to hurt each other. spongebob: uhhuh, we're trying. squidward: well, you're not gonna do any damage with soft pillows.  here, try this. patrick: okay.  squidward was wrong. didn't hurt him, just made him disappear.  squidward: ah. sea spider.  spongebob: ohoh, no, patrick, i'm slipping...and falling.  i didn't even break a bone. patrick: my turn.  i'm losing my footing.  oof. i've survived a deadly fall unhurt. spongebob: life insurance. squidward:  hiya. hiya. spongebob:  what. i can't hear you. squidward:  hiya. patrick:  turn the volume up inside of your voice. squidward: i said...  spongebob: squidward, what were you yelling. squidward: i was trying to say that you got to fall from something higher.  patrick: sea spider.   squidward: ah. my baby.  squidward: once again, i'm asking, what are you doing. spongebob: it's our final test. we're trying to get jellyfish to sting us to prove we can't get hurt. squidward: what.  spongebob and patrick: oh. me. me. sting me. over here. patrick: sting me, sting me, sting me. spongebob: blast me with your venom. patrick: zap me with your pain juice. spongebob and patrick: sting me, please. sting me, sting me, sting me.  squidward: they're the ones asking...  spongebob: gee, squidward,  maybe you should get some life insurance. squidward: what are you yammering about. spongebob: i bought some life insurance for patrick and myself and now we can never be hurt. patrick: yeah. to test out the life insurance, we even built a super dangerous obstacle course across the street.  spongebob: we call it, "the sushi maker."  squidward, i think you need this more than i. i would like to present you with my life insurance policy.  patrick:  actually, you better take two, since you kind of a klutz.  squidward: better take two. life insurance.  you giblet heads. no piece of paper can protect a person from getting hurt.  spongebob: yay. it works. patrick: you're untouchable. squidward: oh, that was just a coincidence.  frankie billy: driving's hard.  spongebob and patrick: yay. life insurance. spongebob: you are magically protected. patrick: whoohoo. spongebob: whoo. squidward: oh, it was just luck. dumb luck.  squidward: look, i'll prove it. you stand here.  squidward: huh.  hmm. oh. patrick: yes. spongebob: you see, squidward. you're immune. patrick: you can't be hurt. spongebob: yeah. you are a castiron squidward. spongebob and patrick: life insurance. life insurance. squidward: wow, i can't believe it, but you two subgeniuses were right somehow. i can't be broken. i'm indestructible. i am shatterproof. watch this.   spongebob: what you gonna do, squidward. squidward: what does it look like. i'm running into a...  wall.  fiasco:  yes. that's just what it needed. i'll call the painting, "one hole." oh, it's genius.  fiasco: ugh. three holes.. that makes no sense.   squidward: did you see that. i ran right through a brick wall. i'm hard as nails. come on, world. bring it on.  spongebob and patrick:  hmm...  squidward: oh, perfect.  squidward: pfft. big tough guy.  spongebob: what are you doing, squidward. squidward: just watch. enjoying your sherbet, herbert. tough guy: my name's not herbert. squidward: oh, i know it's not. your name is "hey." what's your name.  tough guy: hey. squidward: told ya. here, let me help you.  squidward: funny, didn't feel a thing.  spongebob: uh, squidward, i don't think you should lick that. it's got germs. squidward: ha. germs can't hurt me. nothing can hurt me.  squidward: as a matter of fact, do you know what i'm gonna do now. i'm gonna run your super dangerous obstacle course. you know why. patrick: mmmmm. spongebob: no. squidward: because now i've got moxie. spongebob and patrick:  wait, what's moxie.  mr. krabs: what goes on, boyos. spongebob: squidward is gonna try out the sushi maker. mr. krabs: why does he want to do that. spongebob: oh, don't worry, mr. krabs. he's got life insurance. he can't be hurt. mr. krabs: that's not how life insurance works. patrick: it's not. mr. krabs: course not.  life insurance is money the beneficiary gets when a person dies. by the way, who gets the money. spongebob: well, let's see.  no name here. mr. krabs: hooray.  eugene h. krabs. go, squidward.  yay. fly high. do or die. preferably the latter.  spongebob: dddddo or die.. squidward, come down. you're not invincible. life insurance is not what you think. you were right. oh, it was just dumb luck. patrick: now i'm yelling too. squidward: oh, what are those ninnies going on about now. i can't hear you. just shut up and watch me.  nahhey. spongebob: come back, squidward. don't do this. squidward: will you stop shaking it.  squidward: no, no, no, no, no.  squidward: ow... spongebob: hey, squidward, guess what i learned today. apparently, a life insurance policy doesn't protect a person from injury. heh, how about that. squidward: ha, how 'bout that.  spongebob: squidward, how did you survive the sushi maker. squidward:  it had to be this. spongebob: ah. spongebob and patrick: sea spider.  ) )
