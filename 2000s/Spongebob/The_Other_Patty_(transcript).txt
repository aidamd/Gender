workin' out. spongebob: not to worry gentlemen. i have a plan.  oh, yeah, perfect. mr. krabs: we look ridiculous. nobody's gonna buy this disguise. plankton:  i agree.  this is a horrible idea.  spongebob: see. you guys are agreeing already. that's the first step to cooperation.  mr. krabs: okay, what's your stupid plan anyway. spongebob: look over there.   mr. krabs: little more. little more.  spongebob: the flabby patty is hiring. if you can get the job, the recipe is yours. plankton:  why am i on the bottom. mr. krabs: stop whining.  chef: yes. mr. krabs: hello, i'm here to

ingredients thoroughly. fold in warm heart. sounds like a recipe for cannibalism. mr. krabs: wait a minute, this isn't a recipe for patties. it's a recipe for friendship.  chef: you see boys, this recipe is no secret, but i do have a surprise.  spongebob:  tada. i started the flabby patty restaurant just to get you two rascals to team up. and so the power of friendship triumphs again. mr. krabs: what. you mean all this was one of your goofball schemes. plankton: now, now, krabs, spongebob has taught us important life lessons, such as, oh, how to fall out of an airplane for instance. mr. krabs: yeah, and how to comically bludgeon meself. plankton: in fact, i think it's time we repay him, don't you. mr. krabs: great idea, pal.  we'll teach you about teamwork.  get back here.  plankton: we should do this more often, krabs. ) )
