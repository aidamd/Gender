spongebob: aah. patrick, don't you love staring at clouds and thinking about what they look like. patrick: yeah, it really calms my inner demons. spongebob:  wow, look at that cloud.  it looks just like sandy. patrick: i'm not seeing it. ooh, check out that cloud.  it looks just like a... um, um, um, d'oh, it's coming, uh, looks like a... a cloud. spongebob: hmm. it does. hey, look at that one.  it looks just like mr. krabs, doesn't it. patrick: sure does. um... who's mr. krabs again. oh, now that cloud looks like a flying houseboat.  spongebob: um, patrick, i think that really is a flying houseboat.  spongebob: what is it, patrick. patrick: it's probably just one of those fake haunted houses, you know, for babies. spongebob: i don't know, patrick, it's very scarylooking and spooky. patrick: it looks like fun, i'm going to check it out  spongebob: patrick, wait for me.  patrick:  hey, spongebob, can you give me a boost.  patrick: a little to the left.  a little help.  spongebob: hurry up, lazybones.  patrick: wow. look at this place. it's so cheesy. check out this lame doorknob.  patrick: let's check out inside. spongebob: i don't know, patrick. patrick: oh, come on, don't be such a baby.  wow, so lame.  patrick:  nice attention to detail, though.   patrick: huh. so not scary. spongebob:  hey, this is a nice picture.  patrick: did you say something, spongebob.  patrick: hey, spongebob, check this out. spongebob: okay, i'll be right there. patrick: even the spiders are fake. i wish something would... pop out of a closet. like a big, hairy hand.  that would be scary.  but this place is too low budget for that.  it would be cool, though, wouldn't it. spongebob:  yeah, that'd be  neato.  patrick, where is that music coming from. patrick: i think it's coming from that guy.  lord poltergeist:  who dares trespass upon me haunted houseboat.  patrick: we do. lord poltergeist: aye. and what man or beast might you too be. patrick:  look at the attention to detail in his mouth. it's so rotten and slimy.  his bad breath is incredible. his hair is very thin, too. it's dirty.  eww. it reeks, and check out the workship on the jaw mechanism.  remarkablebuilt quality.  obviously a puppet or a robot. hey, we must be in one of those pizza parlors, with one of those singing animated robots. lord poltergeist: robots. puppets. pizza parlors..  patrick: sing us a song, robot. lord poltergeist: what. sing for ye. patrick: oh, whoops. you're right. i almost forgot. you're coinoperated, aren't you.  lord poltergeist: so you want me to sing ye a shanty, eh. patrick: uhhuh. uhhuh. spongebob: don't put yourself out for us. lord poltergeist: and you do not think i'm a real ghost, do ye. patrick: nope. spongebob: i do, mr. dead pirate, sir. lord poltergeist: oh, oh, oh, i'll sing ye a song, all right. a song so terrifying, you'll have to believe i'm a ghost.  patrick: this show is going to be so awesome. spongebob:  yeah, awesome  lord poltergeist: hit it, fingers.  ghosts: yohoho, yohoooooooooooo. patrick:  they're good. ghosts: .oh, we're the ghouls of the briny deep. under the waves we like to creep. creeping in coffins and spider webs as ghostly pillows beneath our heads. oh, we're the ghouls of the briny deep. under the waves we like to creep. we have black shrouds that look quite neat, but we don't own shoes, cause we have no feet. hahaha.  we like to haunt and frighten and scare till you jump right out of your underwear. we like to eat eyes and brains and drink our grog from rusty drains. we don't keep animals like cutesy snails.. spongebob: gary. ghosts: .our favorite pet's, the catoninetails.. cat: meow.  lord poltergeist: do you believe we're real ghosts now. patrick: where's my pizza. what kind of pizza joint are you running anyhow. lord poltergeist: pizza. i'll give you a pizza.  patrick: that's more like it.  anchovies: meep. meep. meep. meep. meep. meep. meep. meep. meep. spongebob and patrick: anchovies..  you are real ghosts. you are real ghosts. lord poltergeist: hahahaha. so ye finally believe, eh. cursed swabs. spongebob: we do. we do. patrick: oh, please don't kill me with your death ray eyes, mr. ghost robot. take my best friend instead. he's lived a full life. lord poltergeist: eh, great friend you have here. spongebob: why have you come to bikini bottom, oh mighty dead person, sir. lord poltergeist: eh, that's funny you should ask. usually, when i come to town, it's to terrify the population and enslave their souls in eternal torment. hahahahaha. yeah, but this time we just blew a head gasket. spongebob: oh, i didn't know you ghosts had gaskets in your heads. lord poltergeist: not us, you imbecile. our engine room broke down.  hey, charlie, you got the busted head gasket out yet. charlie: here you go, boss.  looks like we need a new one.  lord poltergeist: say, maybe you two morons... um, fine gentlemen, could pick up a new one for us. spongebob:  uh, uh, us. lord poltergeist: yes, you. and just as a little incident to make you return , i'll take your souls as deposit.  lord poltergeist: here's a shiny doubloon to buy a new gasket. succeed and maybe you'll get another doubloon. if you aren't back in 24 hours, your souls are mine and you'll be part of my ghastly crew, um, , let's see here, three weeks from thursday... forever. spongebob: um, can we run screaming in horror from your ship now, mr. ghost captain, sir. lord poltergeist: oh, why certainly. spongebob: patrick, after you.  lord poltergeist: such a polite lad.  spongebob: one scoop, please.  spongebob: ghosts, ghosts, a haunted houseboat. patrick:  houseboat full of ghosts.  spongebob: eww, eww, eww, eww.  frank: hey, those guys are insane.  mr. krabs: what in neptune's name is going on.  come back.  spongebob, what in the blue barnacles, are you up to.. spongebob: mr. krabs, it was awful. we just had a spooky encounter of the ghostly kind. mr. krabs: you had a what. spongebob: we were just minding our own business and a haunted houseboat fell out of the sky. patrick:  and it was full of ghosts. the really, real kind, not fake kind.  spongebob: the captain of the ghost gave us this doubloon and told us to buy him a new head gasket. and then, he took our souls and he put them in bottles and he said he's going to turn us into ghosts if we don't get that head gasket. you gotta help us, mr. krabs. i feel so empty without my soul. mr. krabs: did you say doubloon.  let me see that. hmm, looks somewhat authentic  smells real enough.  frank: hey.  mr. krabs: okay, let's go see those ghosts, fellers. we'll catch 'em and take their gold. spongebob: but mr. krabs. we don't know the first thing about ghost hunting.  sandy: i'll catch your ghosts for ya. it'll be easy with my new fangled critterdetectorcatcher gizmo. squidward: and you just happened to bring that with you... to the krusty krab. sandy: sure, i was looking for milkshake gremlins.  sandy: nope, none in there. mr. krabs: great, then it's settled, let's go catch us some ghost gold. squidward: what makes you think i have any interest in your delusional adventurism. mr. krabs: come on, squidward. think about what those treasures can do for the krusty krab, eh. huh. why, i can buy you that break room you've always wanted.  squidward: okay, i'm in. mr. krabs: super. let's go catch us some treasure. so what do you say, spongebob. are ya ready. spongebob: i'll go, but just to get my soul back. mr. krabs: who needs a soul when you're filthy rich.  spongebob: so here it is. pretty creepy, huh. sandy: this place looks like it hasn't been lived in for years. patrick: four years. gotta be longer than that. squidward: i don't see any signs of ghosts  nothing here but a bunch of tacky, old furniture, and boring, representational art.  huh. spongebob: look, mr. krabs. the doubloons. mr. krabs:  hahaha  spongebob: mr. krabs, i wouldn't touch that if i were you. that gold probably has ghost germs all over it. mr. krabs: oh, don't be silly, spongebob. there's no such things as germs.  heads up, squidward.  hey, patrick, think fast. patrick: think.  mr. krabs: all righty, then. let's get while the getting's good. ooh.  looks like i missed one. uh... it seems to be stuck... uuuuuuhhhh...  lord poltergeist: who dares touch me gold. spongebob: it's just us, mr. ghost captain, sir. we brought the replacement gasket you asked for. so if it's not too much trouble, do you think you could give us our souls back... now... maybeee. lord poltergeist: a deal's a deal and i'm a man of me word. here you go, square one.  spongebob: aah. that hits the spot. lord poltergeist: think fast, pink one. patrick: again.  patrick: my soul.  lord poltergeist: harharhar. those weren't your souls. those were just a couple of old orange sodas that have been sitting in the sun too long. patrick: well, i thought mine seemed a little flat. spongebob: but what about our real souls. lord poltergeist: eh, i never had 'em. everyone knows you can't hold onto a wild soul. well, now that that's settled, there's still a little matter of...  me gold. stop right there. no one touches me booty and gets away with it. mr. krabs: pfttttt. you ghosts don't scare me. you're nothing but thin air. grab your sacks and follow me, boys.  noooooooooooooooooooo. lord poltergeist: haharharhar. welcome to the void. hahahahahahaha.
