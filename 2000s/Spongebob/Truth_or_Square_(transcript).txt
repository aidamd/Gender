years ago.  it's ten years ago.  let's see what happens, yeah.  patchy the pirate: oh. bye mom. thanks for the lift.  hey, kids. isn't this exciting. i'm here at nickelodeon, home of spongebob

husband. sandy: and how. wedding officiant: well, then, i now pronounce you sponge and squirrel. you may kiss the bride.  frank : boo. you stink. mr. krabs: worst play i've ever seen.  and a total ripoff. fish: what has happened to the theater.  another fish: lousy costumes.  wedding officiant: i didn't know this was a play.  patchy: well, kids, this was supposed to be the part of the show where spongebob and i were gonna watch old outtakes  and rejected scenes and talk about 'em.  but he never showed up. and now i'm stuck in the belly of a whale. oh, well. we already paid for the airtime, so here they are.  hello, children. you know, like any great work of art, spongebob did not just appear out of nowhere. he started out as a thought.  the he evolved into  a primitive rendering... and along the way  to becoming the sponge we all know and love,  he went through many different changes. and phases and phanges.  and pain can be very painful. for instance,  did you know that spongebob was not the first choice to star in the show.  hard to believe, i know. watch these opening themes, and you'll see why he was eventually picked.  painty: are you ready, kids. kids: aye,
