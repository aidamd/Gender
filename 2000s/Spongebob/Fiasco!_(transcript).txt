patrick:  uhh. such a tired day at the office.  boy, am i famished, i sure wish i knew the best restaurant in bikini bottom.  from where has this glorious scent come. squidward:  hark, the odor you seek is before you. mr. krabs:  at the krusty krab, where the tastiest sandwich in the seas is grilled to perfection by our expert fry cook.  and served with a smile by our friendly waiter.  spongebob: uhh, patrick gobbles down the patties. num num num num num. mr. krabs: wait a minute. why am i dressed in a leotard. spongebob: well, cause you're the mascot. mr. krabs: nah, i don't think so.  we need a gimmic that's nothing short of a masterpiece. spongebob: oh, i know. win a date with squidward tuesday.  squidward: oh, for dolphins sakes.. do tell what's troubling you so. spongebob: mr. krabs doesn't think my ideas are helping. squidward: shocking. spongebob: i just want to help him find the perfect krabby patty gimmic. squidward: sounds like you'd better stop bothering me and put on your thinking cap. spongebob: great idea, squidward.  squidward: that'll keep him out of my hair.  of course, he actually has one.  to each, his own. fiasco: mustard. squidward: yes, your freakishness.  fiasco:  like our own fleating existence, an untimely end has come upon this krabbyvalued meal.  squidward: good riddance.  what's this. something's familiar about those ketchup swirls.  sweet neptune. could that have been... mr. krabs: yeah, yeah enough dillydallying. now, help me with the garbage mr. squidward.  squidward: that's not garbage, it's a fiasco. mr. krabs: ok, let's not overdo it. squidward: no, no, no, you don't get it. it's the work of fiasco the artist.  he was featured in last month's art wonk magazine. mr. krabs:  heh, you call this art. looks like a swappy's footlocker. squidward: it all makes sense now. the dark denim, the dismal statements, the extensive use of red and yellow. this is directly out of his early abstract experiments. spongebob:  ohh, what is this. squidward:  this is an authentic fiasco. customers: a fiasco.  ooh... dave: an original fiasco, you say. gus: he's one of the famous picturedrawing artiste. nancysuzy fish: just look at his audacious use of pickle in this piece. jimmy gus: what's your asking price. squidward: oh, it's simply not for sale, not even for a million dollars. mr. krabs: hold it.  i'll take a million for it. squidward:  it's not yours to sell. i found it. mr. krabs: me plate, me buns, me mustard,  me fiasco. squidward: you tried to throw it away.  it's mine. farfel bainbridge: let's not be hasty. it belongs to neither of you. farfel bainbridge: curator of the bikini bottom art museum. we curators have a way of sniffing these things out.   it's authentic. aahh. which makes this a national treasure.  and for preservation, it must be hermetically sealed.  and guarded by bikini bottom's finest.  officer john: ready for duty, sir. mr. krabs: great idea, farkle. gotta protect me valuable property. farfel bainbridge: well, technically, it doesn't belong to you, it belongs to the people of bikini bottom. unfortunately, they'll have to set foot in this greasetrap to get a look at this great piece of art. mr. krabs: oh, so now you're a restaurant critic.  step up. step up for your free glimpse at the fiasco masterpiece.  alright, you've had your look. now hold up your end of the bargain. frankie billy: two krabby patties, please. mr. krabs: each. plankton:  so, what have you got for me today. huh.  no krabby patty in sight.  what. what's this. looks like a chewedup krabby patty. a perfect sample from which to rebirth engineer a whole krabby patty.  thanks, eugene. you just made my job a whole lot easier. mr. krabs:  i know that scream anywhere. it's me profits dying.  stop that thief. plankton: don't worry, krabs. i'm just taking out the trash for ya. mr. krabs: stop theif.  plankton: heh, heh, heh, that was almost too easy. plankton old boy, you're homefree.  officer john: stop thief. plankton: ahh.  what's with the police.. it's just a bag of garbage.  what's going on. female movie character: how long do you think we'll be here. male movie character: i don't know. but my stomach feels all tingly. female movie character: mine does too.  officer rob: hey you. yeah, you in the chair. officer john: don't move.  plankton:  achoo.  blasted pollen allergies.  ahh, i should be safe in space.  officer john: stop thief. plankton: you gotta be kidding me.  hello. hello. open up. open up. patrick:  do you mind. some of us have nothing to do tomorrow morning.  plankton: wait, what.  hey, keep your hands where i can see em'.  ok you two, against the wall.  that's it. nice and slow.  you gotta help me. ever since i left the krusty krab, i've had all kinds of heat on me. it's so bizarre. normally, when i steal something from the krusty krab, it's krabs who chases me not a bunch of cops. so if you know what's going on, start talking or else you're gonna answer with the spoon, see. spongebob: uhh, i can explain. that partially eaten krabby patty isn't just garbage, it's a work of art. it's worth a fortune. plankton: really. spongebob: so you see why mr. krabs is trying to get it back. plankton: interesting. it appears i've won more than i bargained for. spongebob: plankton, you've stolen a priceless work of art. there's only one thing you can do. plankton: you mean hold onto it until it's really worth something. spongebob: no, you need to turn yourself in. plankton: turn myself in. what.. if i go down, we all go down. you're harboring an art thief. spongebob: who's that. plankton: me, you imbecile. spongebob: what. plankton: not only that, you're an accomplice to the crime, yeah. spongebob: really. plankton: and not only that, but gary's an accomplice too. gary: meow. spongebob: now you've gone too far. plankton: no, you have. criminal accomplice. spongebob: i can't believe you're calling me that. plankton: believe it, man boy. patrick:  guys, what did i tell you before. i'm trying to get some shuteye. spongebob: patrick, what are you eating. patrick: the hors d'oeuvres you left on the table.  not bad. spongebob: now patrick is harboring stolen merchandise in his belly. plankton: ohh, he's an accomplice too. squidward:  here they are, officers. these idiots have been causing a ruckus. interrupting my beauty sleep. officer john: well, well, well. if it isn't the art thief himself. drop the spoon.  you're all under arrest until we figure this out.  squidward: but what do you mean 'all'. i'm not under arrest. i..i..i..uhh.. these are idiots. they're causing a ruckus. i..i want sleep.  officer john:  thanks for clearing this whole mess up, mr. krabs. mr. krabs: of course, officer. heh, can't let me fry cook rot in this place. it'll ruin me business. especially, now that the fiasco's finato.  spongebob:  mr. krabs, i think i have the solution.  mr. krabs: thanks very much. enjoy the show. you sure saved the day boyyo. spongebob: my pleasure, sir. and i think patrick likes it too. patrick:  xrays tickle. fiasco: such artistic genius.  i'll never paint again. squidward:  hey, don't i get a phone call.
