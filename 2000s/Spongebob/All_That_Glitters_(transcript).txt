mr. krabs: i always did like your old spatular. it got the job done every time. spongebob: you're right, mr. krabs. the true measure of a good spatula is by his actions. not by some fancy chrome and buttons. i gotta find my old spatula. mr. krabs: go to em. go now, boy. go before i lose all me customers.  spongebob: spatula it can't be true. it's too late.  doctor: spongebob, ii hate to tell you

you. mr krabs needed a replacement. krabby patties don't flip themselves, you know. it was a moment of weakness. i'm sorryyyy. oh, what have i done. what have i done.  spongebob: : all that glitters
