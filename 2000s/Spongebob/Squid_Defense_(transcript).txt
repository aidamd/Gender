squidward: that's it.. that's the "totality" of your karate mastery. spongebob half 1: well, squidward. i've only been studying a couple of years. but if total karate knowledge is what you seek... spongebob half 2: ...then you should visit sensei cheeks. spongebob half 1: hey. i was just going to say that. spongebob half 2: i know. squidward: oh boy...  sandy: i don't know, spongebob. with the rubbery arms and doughiness in this area, we obviously squidward: alright already. we've been through this. are you going to teach me how to get revenge on my attacker or what.. sandy: whoa, oh, oh.

sandy: "i promise to use karate only for protection and not for revenge." squidward: "i promise to use karate only for protection and not for revenge." or whatever...  sandy: okay then. let's get started with a little choppin'. like so. hiyah. spongebob: whoa. squidward: a board. i wasn't attacked by a piece of wood. i was assaulted by a deranged lunatic. sandy: the only way to protect yourself is if you know the basics. now give it a chop. squidward: sigh...whatever you say sensei... spongebob: this is a tough one squidward. don't feel bad if you can't do it. squidward: i'm sure i can break one little twig. hiiiiyah.  sandy: arms up squidward. block. block.block. block. squidward: arg. this is stupid. the only thing this maniac threw at me were his big, meaty fists. spongebob:  block. sandy: now that's how you do it. squidward: dimwits luck.  spongebob: come on, squiddy. give it the ol' roundhouse. squidward: alright...  hiyah. this isn't working. my assailant was twice as tall. and shoulders were twenty times as broad. the burrows of his brow with the size as biceps. sandy: hmm... we're gotta make this more personal for you squidward. so is to help you bring out your inner dragon. spongebob. spongebob:  hey. grocery boy. it is me. a big, scary miscreant. now hand over that sack of groceries before things get ugly. squidward: groceries. you'll have to pull my
