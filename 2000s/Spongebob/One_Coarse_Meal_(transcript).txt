triumphant husband returns. how'd you fail this time. plankton: krabs had a whale. karen: you mean his big, scary, teenage daughter. plankton: i hear that mocking tone in your voice karen, and i don't appreciate it. don't you remember what happened to my ancestors at the hands of those beasts.  karen: ok when you take a break from your delusional paranoia, the trash needs some attention. it's ripened.  pearl/krabs:  i'm hungry. plankton:  that should keep her out. pearl/krabs:  i want plankton meat. plankton: holy, protozoa.  karen. she's here. she got in. karen: what are you talking about. plankton: there's a whale in the laboratory. karen: are you out of your mind. plankton: see for yourself. karen:  no whale in here. plankton: i swear. a whale was just in here. she was next to the transmutator. she was right here in this spot. her mouth all frothy, her blowhole blowing. karen: oh that's enough plankton. if you'll excuse me, i have to get back to more permanent primary functions.  plankton: karen. karen. karen: i'm not listening. hm hm hm. narrator: 16 paranoia filled days later... karen:  plankton, your dinner is ready. plankton. plankton, do you hear me. plankton: yes, karen. i can hear you. could you please bring it up. i can't risk stepping into the light. the whale might see me.  pearl/krabs:  plankton:  hey. get me out of here.  granddad: hey plankton. glad you could join the rest of the family. plankton: granddad. granddad: yep, and you're pretty brave standing in that there gastric acid. plankton: gastric acid.  no.  i can't take it. oh, this is driving me crazy.  pearl/krabs:  plankton:  what's the point of going on. i'll just be tortured for the rest of my life by that whale.  that's it. i'm done. the 4:15 bus should be here any time now. spongebob: hi, plankton. whatchya doin' laying on the middle of the road. plankton: go away, cheesehead. can't you see i'm trying to get run over. in fact, better yet just step on me as hard as you can, will ya. spongebob: i'm sorry, plankton, but that flies in the face of my good nature. plankton: forget it kid. i'll just wait for the next bus. go on back to the krusty krab and enjoy yourself. spongebob: okay.  mr. krabs:  goodbye, pipsqueak. spongebob: sorry to interrupt your gloating sir, i just thought it would be pertinent for you to know that plankton is laying on the street, forlorn. mr. krabs: really. he's a mess.  spongebob: mr. krabs, i know you and plankton are both sworn enemies and all, but putting on a dress to frighten him. isn't that taking it a little too far. mr. krabs: may i remind you of the fact that you've disclosed the location of me safe, where i keep the secret formula. spongebob: no need to remind me, sir. i've broken rule #2 of the krusty krab rule book: never disclose the location of the secret formula. don't worry, mr. krabs. i'll fix this.  plankton:  man, what does it take to get run over around here.. spongebob: hi, plankton. plankton: what, do you have mud in your ears. take a hike. spongebob: yes, i remember. but, i just wanted to tell that the secret formula is not, i repeat not, in the safe behind the painting in the krusty krab. plankton: what difference does it make. there's no point ever since i've been tortured by that blasted whale. spongebob: don't worry. everyone has a secret fear. for instance, mr. krabs' secret fear is...  plankton: really. spongebob: mmm hmm, and guess what else. that was mr. krabs in whale suit that you've been scared of. plankton: so, you're saying that this whole time it was krabs masquerading as a whale..  why that conniving bottomfeeder. spongebob: but, certainly you wouldn't have use for such, innocuous information, would you. plankton: no, of course not. spongebob: well, back to your selfdestructive behavior, plankton. thank you for this talk. plankton: no, no. thank you.  mr. krabs: this is almost too fun.  plankton ain't even a challenge no more. plankton: oh, is that so. mr. krabs: oh, plankton. back for more, aren'y ya. okay, here it goes.  boo. plankton: you don't scare me, krabs. mr. krabs: i ain't krabs, i'm... uh, i mean...  i'm pearl, not krabs. plankton: the jig is up, krabs. i know all about the suit, and your secret fear. mr. krabs: secret fear.  what are you talkin' about. plankton: see for yourself.  enjoy the show.  mr. krabs: no. no. muhmuhmake it stop. please. plankton: doesn't feel so good on the other end of the stick, doesn't it scaredy pants. i feel wonderful. spongebob: um, plankton, if i were you i wouldn't be so smug. plankton: why not. spongebob: because a hungry pod of whales just showed up for its early feeding.  plankton:  ahhhh. not another feeding. get me out of here.  mr. krabs: whew. you really redeemed yourself boy.  okay, you're beginning to creep me out. ) )
