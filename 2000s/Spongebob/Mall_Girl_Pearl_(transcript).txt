goodness. are you in danger. pearl: in danger of never seeing my friends 'cause i don't have a job. beatrice: come with me. pearl:  weird. i've never been in this part of the mall before.  ugh. what's that smell. beatrice: oh, probably one of the many perfumes that we sell here at grandma's apron. congratulations. you're hired. pearl:  oh, this is the best day of my life. beatrice:  ah.  well, i can't quite afford to be picky these days. the only other employee besides me was myrtle, and she's... no longer with us. both:  myrtle: almost forget my shades. see ya later, suckers.  marina: hey, pearl. over here. nocturna: did you find a job. pearl: yeah, i got a job at grandma's apron. marina:  pearl, you cannot be serious. nocturna: ew, that store is for old people. nixie:  old people are so... old. pearl: old people aren't that bad. are they. all:  marina: hey, girls. i smell moth balls. pearl: well, we are having a sale on them. they're 25% off today. nocturna: um, isn't it your nap time, pearl. nixie: where's your muumuu, granny. all:  beatrice: oh, don't let those bubbleheaded nincompoops get to you, pearly. pearl: but it's not fair. beatrice: life's not fair, my dear. we all go through hard times at some point. here, look. see. i was different from the other girls, and they teased me for it. they called me "boring beatrice." not very creative, those girls.  pearl: who would even take a picture of that. beatrice: oh, good ol' jonesy from the av club took that one. pearl: wait, but who took that picture beatrice: all that matters, pearly, my dear, is that things will soon change. but in the meantime, you should be having as much fun as possible. let me show you how grandmas do it. both:  pearl: whoa, come back here, yarn.  all:  marina:  love the shoes, pearl. pearl: you guys just don't get it. being a grandma is fun. i get to sit in a rocking chair, dust tchotchkes, bake cookies, knite mittens, hats, and scarves. all:  nocturna: scarves. pearl: it's actually, like, the most coral store in the whole mall, so you can all just... just... eat barnacles. all:  beatrice: now, now. girls. let's be polite. marina: what are you gonna do about it, granny.  beatrice: granny power. power. power.  marina:  all:  beatrice: pearl, toss me the autumn years perfume. pearl: hiya. all:  marina: it smells like pills and bed pans. whoa. beatrice:  all:  beatrice: well, now that you're all sitting down, let me tell you about the first time i ever saw a talking picture show. oh, boy, did they know how to talk. nixie: no, please. i can't take anymore. marina: it's... so... boring. nocturna: no, i hate the past. narrator: one hour later... beatrice: and that's why today, we all wear shoes. marina: okay, okay, we get it. we will stop being mean, i promise. just let us go. all: whoa.  marina: listen, pearl. we didn't mean to hurt your feelings or anything. we just, like, think it's weird that you're, like, a grandma now or whatever. we don't really get it. pearl: well, i don't care what you think anymore anyway. i'm being true to myself, andand that's all that matters. all: eh. pearl: i'm a grandma now. right, beatrice. beatrice: oh, pearl, i'm so glad you enjoy being a grandma, but your friends make a good point. beatrice: you're only young once, you see. you don't want to grow up too fast or you'll miss out on all the fun. pearl: i guess you're right. being a grandma is nice and all, but i do miss being a super hip young person. beatrice: go have yourself some fun, my dear. ah, ah, ah, ah. how 'about a nice, gentle handshake instead.  pearl: hey, wait up, guys. i want to be friends while i'm still young. beatrice: i'll see you tomorrow. spongebob:  you dropped this. ) )
