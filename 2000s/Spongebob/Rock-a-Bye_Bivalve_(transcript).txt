messing with me, i know you said something. patrick: ah, but it is you  that is messing with me.  that's what's messing with us. spongebob: it's a baby scallop. patrick:  i'll take care of this. spongebob: no, patrick. it's totally helpless.  it looks like he can't even fly yet. patrick: what's the matter, is he stupid. spongebob: no, patrick, he's just a baby.  he's all alone with no one to take care of him. patrick: well, we can't just leave him out here. spongebob: you're right. come on, let's take him into the pineapple.  hmmm, let's see, we need a box for him to sleep in.  there you go. it's the best seat in the house.  patrick: let me see.  hey, he's kinda cute. uhoh.  i think somebody's hungry. spongebob:  is it true. are you hungry. junior:  cheepcheepcheepcheep. spongebob: i've got just the thing.  how would you like a krabby patty.  patrick: spongebob squarepants, are you crazy. that's not the right food for a little fella like him. spongebob: of course not. i don't know what i was thinking. what he needs is a tiny krabby patty.  junior:  blech. spongebob: huh. no one's ever turned down one of these before.  patrick:  let's try a donut.  spongebob: french fries. junior:  unhunh. patrick:  a donut.  spongebob:  all we have left is this apple.  worm: hello sea creatures. i bring you greetings from apple world.  spongebob: of course, scallops love worms.  worm: huh, wait. we will bury you.  spongebob: well, you should be good for the rest of the...  patrick: what now. spongebob: i don't know. aww, don't cry. patrick: do something, spongebob. spongebob: uhh...uhh...uhh... blahblahblah, look at the funny face. doo, doodoo, doodoo, look at the funny face.  look at the funny face. patrick: wait. i think i might know the problem.  yep, that's it alright.  hold on just one second. there he is, good as new.  spongebob: how did you know. patrick: how do you think.  and i've been doing it all by myself for almost a year. spongebob: wow, i'm sure glad you're here. patrick: i know, good thing there's two of us. spongebob: you know patrick, since this scallop doesn't have parents, we should raise it ourselves. patrick: yeah. at least until it's old enough to be on its own. oh, i wanna be the mom. spongebob: i don't think you can be the mom, patrick, because you never wear a shirt. patrick: you're right. if i was a mom......this would be kind of shocking.  just call me daddy. montage: patrick:  it sure is cute when it's asleep. spongebob:  yeah.  shh.  patrick: hey, spongebob.  spongebob:  yes, patrick. patrick: i never thought being a parent could be this much fun. spongebob: me neither.  patrick: well, good night, spongebob. spongebob: good night, patrick.  patrick, breakfast is ready.  patrick: alright. all this parenting stuff makes me hungry.  hey junior, how are you doing today.  spongebob.  spongebob: yes, patrick. patrick: kid's got a stinky. spongebob:  can you take care of him. my hands are kind of full.  patrick:  ahh. wish i could, but i gotta get going. spongebob: going. where are you going. patrick:  i'm goin' to work. i'm the dad, remember. spongebob: you mean i have to do all this baby stuff myself. patrick: i'll give

'one more minute' me, mr. man.  patrick: hey, i'm missin' the coconut. spongebob: you haven't been helping at all with junior.  we made a commitment and you're not doing your share. you never do anything. patrick: i changed his diaper. spongebob: yeah, once. patrick: he's only this big.  how many diapers could he possibly use. spongebob:  hmmm. patrick: oh, that's not that much. spongebob:

patrick: no more foolin' around. from now on, i'm superdad. i'll work straight through lunch so i can get home on time. so make sure you save a big ol' stinky diaper for me to change, and you can take the night off, pal. spongebob:  great, so i'll see you at six o'clock. patrick: six o'clock. spongebob: six o'clock. patrick: six o'clock. spongebob:  six o'clock. patrick:  six o'clock. spongebob:

a second there, i thought you were mad at me. spongebob:  do you remember what you said to me this morning. patrick: somethin' about root beer, right. spongebob:  no. patrick: oh wait, wait, let me guess. i give up. spongebob: does...  "you can take the night off, pal."  ...ring a bell. patrick:  i don't need this.  spongebob: what. where do you think you're going. patrick:  i'm going back to work.  spongebob: work..   patrick:  he got hit in the head with two coconuts. spongebob:  so. this is work. patrick: you know, it's not as easy as it looks. sometimes i gotta move the antenna, sometimes i lose the remote,  and sometimes my butt itches real bad. spongebob:  oh, you poor, poor thing. by the way, you forgot your briefcase.  patrick:  oh, so this is the thanks i get for working overtime.  spongebob:  overtime..  patrick: yeah, overtime, pal. spongebob:  oh, boy, yeah, you're working. patrick: you know what that means. spongebob: and that's the kind of work you're doing. patrick: .it means working when you're just too tired to work. spongebob: show me where i can sign up for this, because i've been working my fingers to thebone.  patrick: you just keep going on working and working. spongebob: .you never help.  never.  patrick:  there's that stupid noise again. spongebob: oh, that's not a stupid noise. that's just junior about to jump out of that twostory window.  patrick:  oh.  patrick and spongebob:  junior.  spongebob: did you catch him. patrick:  no. spongebob and patrick:  we're bad parents.  spongebob: junior. hey, he's flying. patrick: i guess he's all grown up.  hey, what about daddy.  that's my boy. spongebob: goodbye. patrick: goodbye, junior.  spongebob: well, patrick, he doesn't need us anymore. patrick: this is the hardest part of every parent's life, i assume. spongebob: despite all we've been through, it was worth it. patrick: yeah... let's have another.  ) )
