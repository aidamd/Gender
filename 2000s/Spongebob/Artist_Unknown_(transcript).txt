squidward: ah, how i have dreamed of this day. mr. tentacles, professor of art. what a marvelous opportunity for the people of bikini bottom. bring me your huddle masses of bored house wives and i will shape them into my image.  and i'll go down in history, someday. and there will be a wing with my name on it in all the museums of the world. janitor: dude, you're teaching art at the rec center. calm down. squidward: uncultured trash urchin. 9am. time to let the class in. well, don't want to keep them waiting any longer.  welcome to art class. nat: oh, isn't this cooking. sorry.  spongebob: hi, squidward. are you taking this art class, too. squidward: spongebob. in art class. wait. this is cooking. come back. you gotta be kidding. spongebob:  this is great. you and me in school together. so, where's the teacher. squidward: you're looking at him. spongebob: you are the teacher. to my pupil. this isn't art class, it's heaven. squidward: yeah. grab a little piece of heaven and let's get with it. spongebob: i'm ready, mr. tentacles. squidward: so, you wanna be an artist, eh, spongebob. spongebob: yes, please. squidward: well, art is not all fun and games.  it's a lot of hard...  ...work. ok. first, repeat after me: i have no talent. spongebob: i have no talent. squidward: mr. tentacles has all the talent. spongebob: mr. tentacles has all the talent. squidward: if i'm lucky, some of mr. tentacles talent will rub off on me. spongebob: if i'm lucky, mr. talent will rub his tentacles on my art.  squidward: whatever. ok. since you're telling me you have no prior training, we'll have to start from square one. or should i say circle one.  am i going too fast for you spongebob. spongebob: how's this, squidward. squidward: what the. how the. a perfect circle. do it again. show your process. spongebob: well, first i draw this head.  then i erase some of the more detailed features. and one, two, three. a circle, uhh, thingy. squidward: gimme that.  forget the circles. spongebob: ooh, nice one squidward. let me try.  looky, squidward. it's you and me playing leapfrog. that's you on the bottom. squidward: gimme that.  there is nothing artistic about leapfrog.  what are you doing, now. spongebob: i call it: rippy bits. you take a bunch of old ripped of paper, and make a new picture out of it. see. you're on top...this...time.  squidward: do you want to learn art, or not. spongebob: i'm sorry, squidward, i'll listen. squidward: alright, spongebob, pay close attention. look at your marble. visualize the sculpture within. and...  spongebob:  how's this squidward. squidward:  it's beautiful.  i mean... this isn't a sculpture.  a good sculpture takes... more time. you can't just sculpt willienillie. you've got to go by the book. follow the rules.  otherwise, you'll never get passed amateur hour, here. besides, you've got the nose wrong.  there, now it's art. spongebob: ohhh, it's so obvious. i would've never thought of that. i'm sorry, squidward. i came here to learn and i arrogantly shoved your lessons.  i'll never be a great artist like you. i don't deserve your tutoring. i don't deserve to be in your presence.  i don't even deserve to use your doors.  monty: hello, there. spongebob: but i did deserve that.  i deserved that, too.  and i deserve this. monty: good day, sir. squidward: sorry, class dismissed. you're too late. monty: oh, i beg your pardon, but i've forgotten my manners. my name is monty p. moneybags. squidward: the world famous art collector. monty: the one and only. squidward: well, what are you doing here. monty: i'm on a shopping spree. buying art for my new museum. squidward: your search is over. i am bikini bottom's greatest artiste. i call this one: "squidward en repose". monty: i, uh, don't think that will fit in with the other pieces in my collection. squidward: why not. monty: because, it's an art collection.  squidward: how about this one. i call it: bold and brash. monty: more like: belongs in the trash.  janitor: sorry. i must've missed that one.  monty: maybe i should be... huh. what is that. squidward: wait, wait. that's not uh, uh... monty: angelic form, amazing detail, perfect censorship. this is the work of a true genius. hello. what this. this is the only flaw.  ah, that's more like it. i simply must find the artist responsible. he shall have fame. squidward: fame.  monty: fortune. squidward: fortune.  monty: anything his heart desires. squidward: anything.  it's me. it's me. i'm responsible. monty: i can see it now. your name in the world's most prestigious museums. i'm gonna make you, immortal.. now, uh, help me get this in the car. squidward: i could use a little help.  my fame. my fortune. my hair. monty: well, that's a bit a bad luck right there. but, this shouldn't be a problem for an artist of your magnitude. you can whip up another one. squidward: yeah, no problem. you know, between you and me, this isn't my best work. why don't you come back tomorrow and i'll have something that will really knock your socks off. monty: between you and me, i'm not wearing socks.  squidward: yeah, no socks. ok, see you tomorrow. bye.  i gotta find spongebob..  spongebob...spongebob. spongebob. spongebob: go away, squidward. i don't deserve your kindness. squidward: hey, cheer up. i have decided to give you another chance. why, with a great teacher like me, anything is possible. spongebob: don't look at me squidward. don't look at my shame.  these hands weren't meant to create. they only destroy. i can't look at them.  squidward: aww, c'mon spongebob. you've got yourself a pair of yellow dandies here. with my help, we'll turn them into tools of beauty. spongebob: really. squidward: really. spongebob: really. squidward: really. spongebob: really. squidward: really. spongebob: wow.  really. squidward: let's go. spongebob:  squidward, look. it's ol' bold and brash. squidward: gimme that.  ok, spongebob. just do what you did before. spongebob: i... can't. squidward: ah, ah. wait, wait. let me help. let's start with the circle again. spongebob: i did it, squidward.  squidward: huh. but, but, what about the head...and the erasing, and the, the... spongebob: i don't know, squidward. that stuff's not in the book. squidward: uhh...  how about this, huh. remember. spongebob: that's not in the book, either. squidward: forget about the book.  ha. look at all this mess spongebob.  what do all these little bits of paper make you want to do. spongebob: wait, i know this. oh, wait, i think i got it.  tada.  squidward: ok, spongebob. let's just move onto the marble. spongebob: first, an artist must concentrate and visualize his concept. squidward: now you've got it. spongebob: i've gotta embrace the marble. squidward: right. spongebob: i've gotta sniff the marble. squidward: well, uh, ok. spongebob: i've gotta lick the marble. squidward: uhh... spongebob:  i've gotta wash the marble. i've gotta date the marble.  i've gotta be the marble. i've got it. i have see the sculpture within. squidward: here you go, buddy.  spongebob: with this tool, i shall give birth to art. squidward: oh, boy.  spongebob: but, one more thing.  there. now it's art. well, what do you think, squidward. just take it all in for a moment. let it soak in.  it looks like the excitement of my artistic triumph is too much for squidward. oh, well, back to the dump.  .to the dump, to the dump, to the dump, dump dump. to the dump, to the dump, to the dump, dump dump. . monty: i'm here for the... what the. who is responsible for this. squidward: as of now, it's his responsibility.  good day to you, sir.  monty:  you, sir, are the greatest artist who ever lived. ) )
