your radar gun. officer: umm... okay.  actually, he's going 40mph under the limit. so, move along before i run you in, tattletale.  spongebob: are you sure you don't want to run him in.  it's a red light, patrick.  patrick, you just ran 3 red lights. patrick: so. spongebob: you're suppose to stop. patrick: i think the driving genius knows what he's doing. spongebob:  driving genius.. why would a genius make an illegal uturn... through an orphanage.. patrick: they ran for it in time. what are you so mad about. spongebob: i should've gotten that license, and this should be my boat mobile. patrick: how can you say that.. if you were my friend, you'd be happy for me getting my license. spongebob: if you were my friend, you wouldn't rub your license in my face. patrick: i'm not rubbing my license in your face. this is rubbing my license in your face.  spongebob: oh, give me that. i worked my whole life for this. you don't deserve this.  officer: huh, litterbugs. this is why i joined
