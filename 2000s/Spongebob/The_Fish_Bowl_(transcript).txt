sandy: huh.  sandy:  it's here. yeehaw. my newest science book has arrived. i wonder what new and fantastic area of science will be revealed to me this month.  oh, hey. it's those fancy bloomers i ordered too. this day keeps getting better.  ahh. behavorial psychology is the study of people and their habits. i studied underwater chemistry, geology, and astronomy, but i never studied underwater people.  sandy: sandy cheeks. day one of behavioral study of subjects in bikini bottom. initiating observations,  now.  charlie: my mom says she wouldn't even try it. no matter how much i saw the lagoons. amanda's mother: my daughter amanda is exactly the same. it's always an argument, but i've tried to...  sandy: older lumpy looking female subject. obviously, a mother. hates daughter. amanda's mother: excuse me. sandy: subject asked to be excused, but i am unable to observe what she wishes to be excused from. fred: hey. creepy squirrel. what's with all the eavesdropping. charlie: take a hike, mammal. sandy: emotional state seems to be rising in anger. eyebrows are now considerably burrowed.  sandy: i gotta find new subjects.  sandy: who won't mind being observed.  sandy: eureka. prospector: hey, that's my line.  sandy: hey, fellas. how'd you like to be part of my cool experiment.  patrick: ooh. i could use a mint. mmm. sandy: no, patrick. it's an experiment in behavioral psychology. patrick: that doesn't sound tasty. spongebob: what do we have to do. sandy: it's easy. i observe you while you two act normal. spongebob: act normal. sandy: yeah. just do what you naturally do.  be natural. starting now.  spongebob: uh, natural greeting to you, friend. patrick: natural greeting returned.  spongebob: would you like to have some natural fun. patrick: oh, yes. please. spongebob: naturally.  sandy: aww. alright. experiment's done.  spongebob: ooh. ooh. ooh. ooh. ooh. ooh. ooh. ooh. what are the results. patrick:  hey, did we do good. spongebob: oh, can i have an a+. patrick: oh. oh. yeah.  i want an a+ too.  patrick: pretty please. pretty please. pretty please. spongebob:  pretty please with sugar on top. sandy: yes, yes. you both get an a+. spongebob: whoo... patrick: i knew it.  sandy: subjects acting natural. resume observation. spongebob: i got an a+.  spongebob and patrick: a+. a+. a+. sandy: oh, forget it.  sandy: when a subject is aware of being observed, it can affect his or her actions and create inaccurate data. hmm...  sandy: double eureka. two prospectors: that's our line.  sandy: hey. are you guys up for another experiment. spongebob: oh boy. am i ever. can you hook us up to electrodes. or. or expose us to gamma rays. patrick: yeah. sandy: it's a guaranteed a+. patrick: oh. it's like a dream. sandy: ok. first thing. go to the beach and fill one bucket with white sand and one bucket with black sand. can you do that. spongebob: easy sneezy.  sandy:  eew. patrick: hey, yeah. whatever he said. sandy: then off

patrick: cameras.  spongebob:  et tu, gary. gary: meow.  patrick: i was a monster. i deserve a z.  spongebob: aww, patrick. don't be so hard on yourself. it was the experiment's fault that you were
