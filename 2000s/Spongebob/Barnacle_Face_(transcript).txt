pearl: boy, do i love high school. . you know what. someday we're gonna remember all this, and we're gonna look back and say... remember. pearl's friend:  speaking of remembering, you didn't forget the bikini bottom high school dance is tomorrow night, did you. pearl: of course i didn't forget. i'm so excited. pearl's friend:  me too.  pearl's friend:  barnacle. pearl: what.. pearl's friend: pearl i'm gonna say this as touchily as possible.  there is a hideous barnacle growing out of the side of your face. pearl:  where..  pearl's friend: there.  pearl's friend: pearl, it's not really bad as you...  mr. krabs: spongebob. spongebob:  yes, mr. krabs. mr. krabs: didn't you already mop this area. spongebob:  affirmative, captain. mr. krabs: well, then, why would you mop it again. spongebob: why wouldn't i.  mr. krabs: good point.  mr. krabs: pearl, what brings you in on such a fine afternoon. pearl: oh, daddy. it's terrible. the school dance is this weekend. mr. krabs: oooh, that is terrible.  makes my shell crawl just thinking about it. bleugh. pearl: no, daddy. don't you understand.. the terrible part is that i can't go to the dance. mr. krabs:  why ever not. pearl: because i have a hideous barnacle growing on the side of my face. mr. krabs: ohhohoho. now, calm down there, my little pearl. i'm sure it can't be half as awful as you...  mr. krabs: i meant whatever you need to get rid of your blemish, not liquidate me retirement fund.  harold: you know what. let's go across the street to the chum bucket. nat: i heard they have better weather over there.   no. wait.  this is starting to eat away me profit margin. if i don't come up with a solution fast, it's gonna cost me more than a couple cases of cold cream.  spongebob: lalalalalalalalalalala. mr. krabs: oh, spongebob.  how would you like to...  ease it.  how would you like to do your dear old chum a favor and raid this beautiful daughter of her evil barnacle. spongebob: i will do you this favor, sir chum, never fear.  pearl: i don't know, spongebob. the school dance is right around the corner, and this barnacle seems to be getting bigger by the minute. spongebob: don't fear, pearl. we'll get rid of this barnacle in no time. i know just what to do. pearl: are you sure. spongebob: one time, my friend patrick had this barnacle the size of an extra large krabby patty right at the center of his forehead. anyway, i fixed it so we never saw that barnacle again. pearl: how. spongebob: i took him to see a hypnotist. pearl: you took patrick to a hypnotist. spongebob: no. the barnacle. it became convinced it was a pelican and flew south for the winter. we never saw that pelican again. pearl: i thought you said it was a barnacle. spongebob: what did i say. pearl: pelican. spongebob:  he was a really good hypnotist.  spongebob: now just remain calm and it's all over before you know it. pearl: are you really going to use hypnosis to get rid of the... barnacle. spongebob:  hypnosis. no. hold still now.  pearl: is everything okay. spongebob:  i don't think this is going to work.  this ol' shovel is gonna do the work.  pearl: did it come off. spongebob:  gettin' there.  pearl: spongebob, how much longer. spongebob: oh... shouldn't be too much longer.  personally, you could take a break off if you'd like. pearl: good idea. i'm going to scrub my face with some soap and water. spongebob: okay.   spongebob:  pearl.  pearl, what happened. pearl: there's more.  spongebob:  i mean, you're right. there's more. pearl:  all i did was wash with soap and water. spongebob:  hmm... water and... this soap. pearl: yes, but why. spongebob:  because this soap smells so wonderful. that's why. hmm, i know this fragrance from somewhere.  oh, i'm sorry, did you want a whiff. pearl: no. spongebob:  more for me.  spongebob:  no, i think one jar of concealing cream is enough. don't worry, pearl, no one will notice a thing.  mr. krabs:  pearl, i'm home.  spongebob: something wrong, mr. krabs. mr. krabs: for a second there, i thought a towering, hideous, mindboggling abomination was standing here, staring at me in my own living room. but then i realized...  it's only my old, beloved daughter, pearl.  oh, pearl. no, no, no need for these expensive trips to the spa. but don't worry, spongebob here will take care of it. i have more important measures to take care of.  me jewwweells.  spongebob: pearl.  pearl, you've been in the bathroom crying for three hours now. you can't stay in there forever. pearl:  i'm not going to the dance. spongebob: okay, i'm coming in.  look at the bright side, pearl. at least you can still play the piano. pearl: and what exactly would that do to me. spongebob: i have no idea.  don't worry, pearl. i'll fix your crying. pearl: how. spongebob: well, i'm sure if i'll think strong enough, something will pop up.  oops, i didn't mean it like that.  hey, it's that delicioussmelling soap again.  pearl:  spongebob: okay. where do you keep your soap. pearl: in the basement. duh, where else.   spongebob:  hello.  something there. pearl..  mr. krabs. mr. krabs: don't just stand there, boy. come help me with this.  there we go. sometimes it just gets a little stuck. spongebob: mr. krabs, what is this thing. mr. krabs: why, it's my old soap press. spongebob: soap press. mr. krabs: that's right. all the soap pearl and i use comes from this machine. and the best part is, it runs on 100% pure leftover krabby patties. spongebob: leftover krabby patties. mr. krabs:  their precious essences are harvested, and after a brief cooling process, tumble out this conveyor belt as fresh, wonderful bars of soap.  fresh and invigorating. plus, it's absolutely free. spongebob:  ohhhh, that explains why it smells so familiar. i don't know about this, mr. krabs. if pearl finds out that you... pearl:  i've been using soap made out of krabby patties.. mr. krabs: krabby patty essence. pearl: that's grease. mr. krabs: well, if you want to split hairs, i suppose pearl:  daddyyyyy.  mr. krabs:  got to go, keep your cellphone. pearl:  i'm never gonna be able to get these barnacles off. my young life is ruined forever. spongebob: don't worry, pearl. i said i'm not going to let mr. krabs down, and i'm not going to. what do you think of that. pearl:  the bikini bottom high school dance was supposed to be my chance to sparkle, my spongebob: wait a minute, pearl, say that again. pearl: okay. the bikini bottom high school dance was supposed to be my chance to sparkle. spongebob: okay, you can stop. i think i have an idea...  pearl: are you done yet. spongebob:  all set. close your eyes and get ready to sparkle. one, two, three.  tada. what do you think. pearl: i don't know, spongebob what would my friends say. spongebob:  we shall see shortly. pearl: are you sure. spongebob:  shh. trust me.  blue fish: pearl, we're here to pick you up to thewow. pearl, you look amazing. pearl: i do. blue fish: well, not amazing. sparkly and shiny and amazing. pearl: whee. to the bikini bottom high school dance. pearl and her friends:  let's go.  spongebob: you have a good time, carefree teens. mr. krabs:  my jewels. spongebob, my entire collection of precious jewels is gone. seen it. spongebob: of course. pearl's wearing it to the bikini bottom high school dance. mr. krabs: help. police. thief.  stop that whale. spongebob: i promised
