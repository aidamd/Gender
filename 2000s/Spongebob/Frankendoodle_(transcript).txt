french narrator: well, well, what is this. ah, the artist at sea. let us watch and see the fruits of his struggle. ah, it seems that inspiration has struck. artist: hmm... ah.  my pencil.  what. french narrator: the artist has learned the first lesson of the sea: always bring a spare pencil. artist: nooo.  spongebob: ok. ready, patrick. one... patrick: two... both: three.  spongebob: scissors beats paper, patrick.  one... both: two... spongebob: three.  patrick, how come you always do paper.  patrick: what is that thing spongebob. spongebob: it looks like a giant pencil. patrick: go touch it.  spongebob: it is a giant pencil, patrick.  let's draw some giant pictures with it. patrick: whatcha drawin'. spongebob: stand back, patrick. i can't draw with you breathing down my neck. patrick: psh, artists. spongebob: it's a jellyfish. patrick: pretty good, spongebob. but it's lacking basic construction, and your perspective leaves a lot to be desired. spongebob: eh, everybody's a critic.  patrick: spongebob, your drawing's coming to life. spongebob: now that's more like it, mr. critic. patrick: no, i mean it's swimming away. spongebob: do you know what this means, patrick. patrick: your art can never hang in a museum. spongebob: it means we found a magic pencil. patrick: now all i need is a magic mustache and all my dreams will have come true. spongebob:  coming right up.  patrick: life is good.  easy come, easy go. squidward: squidward, if you had some hair, you'd be the most gorgeous creature in the sea. you've got looks... talent... all you need is a full head of...  hair. patrick: my turn. spongebob: be careful, patrick. being an artist is a heavy responsibility. each work of art is like a child and must be treated as such. patrick: come on. i was just gonna draw a cartoon. spongebob: okay. why didn't you say so. hey. another jellyfish. patrick: it's squidward, silly.  spongebob: it's kind of creepy looking when it moves. patrick: you're right, spongebob. spongebob: we can't let it go into town.  patrick: poor squidward. spongebob: hey. my brain just hatched an idea.  this is gonna be classic. squidward:  i think i fancy a stroll around the park. spongebob:  oh, squidward. squidward:  what do you want. hello, what's this. someone left me money for a perm. come to hairy.  ow. spongebob. oh, my hair.  spongebob. spongebob: wait. i've got another idea. this'll be the ultimate prank. i'll draw me, and when squidward answers the door... it won't be me. aww, look at him. ain't he a doll.. all he needs is a tie.  ready for action.  patrick: he's going to the door. spongebob: he's knocking on the door. spongebob: squidward's answering the door and...  squidward: ow. ow. ow. ow. ow. ow. ow. patrick: he's beating up squidward. spongebob: doodlebob, stop.  patrick: he's got the pencil. spongebob: what have i done. we've got to find him. where could he possibly be. patrick: maybe he's in that poorly drawn pineapple. spongebob: come on, let's go.  patrick: i'm not going in there  spongebob: come on, patrick. i'm right behind you. baby steps. almost there...  patrick: what just happened. doodlebob:  meahoy, memoyay. meyoyyoy, ladyonmamoy. spongebob: come on, patrick. give me a boost up. patrick: can't we just stay down here where it's safe. spongebob: no way. i created this monster and i've got to stop him.  doodlebob: neofineyin. spongebob: see what i mean, patrick. patrick: where's the leak, ma'am.  yurrgh.  spongebob: you okay, patrick. patrick: finland. doodlebob:  meyaiovah. mee hoy minoy. meah froyay.  spongebob: there he is. patrick: he's hideous. he makes me sick, just looking at him. those big bulgy eyes, that square body, those two buck teeth, and that stupid tie. spongebob: eh hem. patrick:  oh... but it looks good on you, spongebob. heh heh. spongebob: he's putting down the pencil. this is our chance. on the count of three, we'll jump out and surprise him. patrick: oh, boy, a surprise party. is it his birthday.  doodlebob:  bawahh bwah bwah wahh.  spongebob: patrick. patrick. do something. patrick: happy birthday. spongebob:  arrgh. patrick:  here's your present.  you're welcome. doodlebob:  dewaaagheaugaaagh.  spongebob: hold it right there, doodle. i brought you into this world and now i'm gonna take you out. any last words. doodlebob:  bee ha, bala hala ba ba. spongebob: i'm sorry, what was that. doodlebob:  bee ha, bala hala ba ba.  spongebob: hold still, doodle. this is for your own good.  take that and this and this and that and this that this that...  i am spongebob, destroyer of evil. patrick: take it easy, it's just a drawing. spongebob: well, that takes care of that, eh, patrick. patrick: done and done.  spongebob: gee, gary, you should have been there. it sure was exciting, but you know, i kind of miss the little doodle. he was like a son to me. but i'm sure glad things are back to normal. well, goodnight, sweet prince. gary:  meow. spongebob: goodnight, magic pencil.  oh hey, magic pencil. what are you doing up. drawing yourself a glass of water.   doodlebob.  no hard feelings, right.   what do you think you're doing, doodle.. doodlebob: you doodle. me spongebob.  huh.  spongebob:  be careful with that thing. who knows what will happen.  i nose.  very funny, doodle. now it's my turn.  well, doodle, it looks like this is a draw.  you've made your point, no matter, i was voted most artistic in high school.  squidward:  ow. spongebob, you're gonna pay for that. spongebob: or maybe it was most clumsy.  huh.  paper.  page for mr. doodle.  patrick: hey, spongebob, what's with all the ruckus. spongebob: take a look for yourself, patrick. patrick:  it's the evil doodle. spongebob: no, no, not evil. he was just a twodimensional creature lost in our threedimensional aquatic world longing for a purpose. patrick: so... he's a drawing. spongebob: exactly. see how happy he is. patrick:  he still looks kind of creepy. spongebob: oh, great magic pencil, your powers are too mighty for us ocean dwellers. so i will send you back to the magic kingdom from where you came. are you ready, patrick. patrick: ready.  french narrator: we rejoin the artist in a creative slump. artist:  huh. what's this.  my pencil.  french narrator:  the second most important rule for the artist at sea: always bring a pencil sharpener. artist: nooooo. ) )
