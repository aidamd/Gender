little distracted.  i'm practicing for my oral report for boating school tomorrow. squidward: you know, spongebob, statistics show that public speaking is the number three cause of stress right behind death and marriage. now get those orders ready. spongebob: okay. okay.  hm, what's so scary about public speaking anyway. you just stand in front of the public and speak publicly. it's really no different to what i do everyday.  spongebob: no big deal, spongebob, you just stand in front of them...  ...front of them looking...  ...at me  ...with their eyes.  squidward is right. public speaking is frightening. squidward:  must i do everything myself.  huh. stay back. you'll get your patty when it's your turn.  spongebob: i never knew an audience can get so physical.  this changes everything.  patrick: oh, sorry, wrong rock.  spongebob: patrick, i wonder if you'd help me by lending me your eyes. patrick: okay.  uhhh... spongebob: no, no, no, no, no, you can keep them. i just want you to watch me while i practice my speech up here.  just pretend you're a student at his desk. patrick: okay.  spongebob:  patrick: hhold on, i'd like to sit in the back of the class.  spongebob: okay, here

happened, patrick. patrick: oh, come on, spongebob, you think everyone can stay awake through a boring speech. spongebob: i don't know. do you think that's too much to expect. patrick: yes. and you should be prepared for worse. spongebob: worse. patrick: you're gonna have things thrown at you that you wouldn't believe. you gotta be ready. now try again. spongebob: okay.  boating safety...  boating safe...  patrick: that's it.  fight through.  spongebob: patrick, nobody throws pillows in class. patrick: says you. speech. spongebob: boating safe...  patrick:  spongebob squarepants, what a mess you've made of my classroom. spongebob: uh, you sorta add a hand in that too patrick. patrick:  young man, how dare you.  spongebob: wha, a detention slip. patrick:  i'm not hearing your oral report. spongebob: okay.  boating safe...  patrick: try again. spongebob:  boating safety...  patrick: come on, squarepants. is this the best you can do. spongebob: patrick, somehow i don't think this is working.  patrick:  speech.  speech. speech. speech.  speech. speech. speech.  speech. speech. speech.  speech. speech. spee  spongebob: patrick, stop. somehow your help just isn't helping. i am more nervous about this oral report than i've ever been about anything.  patrick: yeah, you do look pretty terrible. spongebob: well, if i don't do my report then i don't pass. and if i don't pass then i don't get my boating license.  patrick: wait, buddy. i know how you can get your boating license. your friend the squirrel girl is real good with her paws.  maybe she can make you a fake one. spongebob: no, patrick, that's illegal, but she might be able to help me get over this anxiety. she's always speaking at science conferences. she's probably full of pointers. patrick: yeah, or she probably has a robot that can demolish the whole school for ya.  sandy: hmm... white knuckles, leaky pores, and stomach in knots. yyyep. he does look pretty bad. spongebob, you're afflicted to severe oral reportitis. you know, patients with this disease have been known to physically explode. kerpow. spongebob:  sandy: it has been scientifically proven that  85% of speech related stress can be eliminated if the speaker imagines the audience in their underwear.  sandy: everyone will look so silly, you won't even remember you're nervous. which is why i invented these.  goggles that let you see people in your undies. or, i could just make you a fake boating license. spongebob: that's still illegal. give me the goggles.  it's not working. sandy: well, of course it isn't, silly. i'm only wearing my undies. see if it works on patrick. spongebob:  eh. ooh, they work.  billy: ...and they were never heard from again. mrs. puff: thank you, billy. that was an excellent report. next we have spongebob squarepants. ugh. patrick:  go on, buddy. spongebob:  mrs. puff: well, spongebob. do you have your oral report ready. spongebob:  huh.... mrs. puff: the assignment i gave you. the one where
