sandy: cheeks residence patrick: sandy, don't hang up. sandy: what do you want. patrick: oh, nothing. i'm just hanging with the sponge. how about you. sandy: oh, you know. a little of this, a little of that, a little vacuuming... patrick:  sounds like fun. i wish i was over there. spongebob's house is boring. there's nothing going on over here.  sandy: that sure don't sound like nothing. what's all the ruckus. patrick: oh, spongebob's pineapple is rotting and falling apart all around us... we're doomed. sandy: i'll be right over. patrick: oh take your time... spongebob: holding steady patrick. but, who knows how long this support system will last. squidward:  ow sandy: this place sure went to pot, quick. knockity knock, spongebob. spongebob: no, sandy don't. we must never, ever knock. this pineapple could topple over the slightest gesture.  mr. krabs:  spongebob, what are you doing here. you were supposed to be at work two hours ago.  frank : hello. anybody here. hello..  do you guys know how to make a krabby patty. dave: no, but i do know how to open a cash register. mr. krabs: your absence is costing me money. spongebob: mr. krabs, i know. i'm sorry, but my hou... mr. krabs: and, squidward. i expect more from you. well, actually, no... i don't. sandy: well, i'm with you spongebob. and i've got the toolbox to prove it. patrick: i'm here because... wait a minute, why am i here. spongebob, i'm having another exit pencils crisis. spongebob: not now, patrick. and squidward has done a great job holding it up. squidward: against my will, i might add. spongebob: so what do you say mr. krabs. will you help. mr. krabs: well... i suppose i could join the cause. but, it'll have to be our standard deal. spongebob: a week of my wages per hour. mr. krabs: you got it kiddo. sandy: well what are we waiting for. let's get this restoration underway.  sandy:  perfectly calibrated.  ow.  mr. krabs:  not a bad bit of wooden starry if i do say so meself. time to put the finishing touches on her.  hm. patrick:  spongebob: uuummmmmm... excuse me, everyone. not to micromanage or anything, but do any of you actually know how to build a pineapple.. sandy: well of course we do silly. firstly, every pineapple needs a solid foundation to keep it firmly in place... mr. krabs: not exactly, miss cheeks. a pineapple needs to be mobile, with a strong hull attached in case you need to skip town unexpectedly. patrick: wrong. a pineapple needs a sweet, but tangy flavor.  spongebob: those are all very great ideas, but... sandy: but, arguing ain't gonna get this pineapple fixed. good point.  okay, fellas. from now on, we incorporate everyone's ideas. patrick and mr. krabs: yeah. spongebob: uh, that's not exactly what i had in mind, sandy...  sandy: first thing you gotta do is clean out all this old junk. spongebob:  sandy, my furniture is perfectly fine. mr. krabs: heads up.  careful, boy. i thought i'd install a grill in your tv room for those nights where you have to bring work home with you. spongebob: yeah, but i like to watch tv in my tv room. sandy: well, this ain't the tv room, anymore. this is your indoor garden.  spongebob: but, the sofa goes there. sandy: oh, i know. but, isn't this better. gary: meoooowwww. spongebob: gary, do you ever feel like you are not being listened to. gary: meow. spongebob: sandy, we need to talk. sandy: about these columns. nice, huh. gives the pineapple an intellectual flavor. spongebob: yeah, but i kind of liked my pineapple the way it was. i don't need all these fancy sandy: sorry, buddy. ii can't understand you. you've got something in your mouth. mr. krabs:  ho ho, kiddo. look out. just applying some plaster stucco exterior here. spongebob:  i guess what i'm trying to say is there's nothing wrong with a pineapple that looks like a pineapple. gary:  meow. spongebob:  oh, no, gary. i still haven't fed you. let's take care of that right now, little bud patrick:  it's just not a house without a rock to sleep under. sandy: well, what do you think, spongebob. spongebob: it's, uh... mr. krabs: yes. spongebob: it's, uh... sandy: fantastic. spongebob: it's, uh... patrick: i'm hungry. spongebob: you all worked very hard. mr. krabs and patrick: whoohoo. sandy: yeehaw. mr. krabs: and, since you're such a satisfied customer, i only charged you double.  sandy: good job, fellers. mr. krabs: good work, boy. patrick: i'm starving.   spongebob: well, gary. here it is. our new home.  hmmm. this must be patrick's contribution to the living room. hey, vintage condiment jugs. thank you, mr. krabs.  yaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh.  gary, where's the sink.. gary: meow. spongebob:  gary, i don't think that was the sink. gary: meow. spongebob:  thanks for the futuristic bathroom, sandy.  gary: meow. spongebob: well, this isn't exactly home sweet pineapple, but i suppose it could be much worse. we still a roof over our heads and food on the table. hey, that reminds me. you still haven't eaten today, have you. sorry, buddy. you must be famished.  gary: meow.  squidward: ah. i'm unraveling.  if you ever, and i mean ever ow. my neck. i'm gonna be in the chiropractor's for a week.  spongebob: well, gary. there's only one thing left to do:  call and have this place condemned.  hello, operator. city hall, please, office of broken dreams. gary:  meow. spongebob: oh, gary, i'm sorry. with all this house ruckus, i completely forgot to feed you. here you go, buddy.  "furnished pineapple in a can." oh, gary. you are the best.  ) )
