tv announcer: and now, back to crustacean crime theater.  shellnapping victim: stop. thief.  cop #1: which way did he go. shellnapping victim:  he went that way. cop #2: let's get em, boys.  thief:  curses. foiled again.  mr. krabs: what a nogood eelinakelp that guy was.  there ain't nothing worse than a thief.  thieves need to be locked up forever. they should all be strung up by their gills and forced to breathe air.  spongebob: but, mr. krabs,  what about all the stuff you stole.  mr. krabs: what do you mean. spongebob:  like that barrel.  it says, "property of salty sea farms".  mr. krabs: oh, that's where i rent me pickles from.  spongebob: are you renting the barrel, too.  mr. krabs: well, no.  spongebob: then you bought it.  mr. krabs: no.  spongebob: then, isn't that stealing.  mr. krabs: well, i, uh...  patrick:  what about this towel from the sizzling spring sauna.  mr. krabs: um... well..  spongebob:  and this bikini bell phone.  mr. krabs: well, uh, it's  patrick:  and sandy's hedge clippers.  mr. krabs: oh, they're...  spongebob: ...and plankton's lawn mower.  mr. krabs: well, he... spongebob:  even mrs. puff's hair curlers.  mr. krabs:  that one was a gift.  listen, all that stuff is, uh... borrowed.  spongebob: borrowed. well, that's a relief. i thought you took it without  permission.  mr. krabs:  ah, permission shmermission. you can borrow anything you want, anytime, as long as if you give it back  before it's missed.  everyone knows that. right.  spongebob and patrick:  okay.  mr. krabs: all right then.  hugs.  you put in  a hard day's work, boys.  patrick: but i don't work here.  mr. krabs: see you later.  oh, that was a close one.  spongebob:  what do you want to do today.  patrick: i don't know. what do you want to do today. spongebob: i don't know. what do you want to do today. patrick: i don't know. what do you want to do today. spongebob: i don't know. what do you want to do today.  patrick: i know what i want to do today.  i need some money.  uh.  oh.  oh...   i don't have any money.  spongebob, i want a balloon really, really badly.  really, really badly.  spongebob: it's okay, patrick. there's lots of money in  the first national bank of spongebob.  follow me.  uhoh. i'm broke, too.  and maybe we could borrow money from squidward.  patrick: no, wait.  instead of borrowing the money, why don't we just borrow the balloon..  spongebob: yeah, like mr. krabs.  patrick: it's just borrowing, right. spongebob: yeah, and borrowing is okay as long as we bring it back, right. patrick: right.  patrick: this is so great.  spongebob: we're going to have so much fun. first we can run with the balloon.  patrick: yeah, then we can go to the beach with the balloon.  spongebob: yeah. then we can take a bike ride with the balloon. then we can go to the movies and the arcade and the ice rink and the pizza shop.  patrick: and the moon and the sky and under a car, behind the dumpster.  spongebob: and the candy shop. patrick: and then my backyard. spongebob: and in a plane. patrick: and over a rock. spongebob: and under a hill. patrick: and with a whale. spongebob and patrick: we love borrowing.  spongebob: it popped.  patrick: how are we going to return it now, spongebob.  spongebob:  i got the pieces.  patrick:  i got the air.  spongebob: hurry put the pieces on.  we popped the balloon. patrick: gaheh. spongebob: we can't return it. patrick: whaguh. spongebob: we're thieves. patrick: hiyohoo. spongebob: we have to confess.  patrick: confess..  are you out of your mind.. do you have any idea what they do to people like us. we're not talking about some dumb mail fraud scheme or a hijacking here.   we stole a balloon.   and they're going to lock us up forever.  spongebob: you're right,   we've just got to keep our heads. act normal.  frankie billy: wow, street performers.  spongebob and patrick:  it's not working.  lou: hi there.  lou: hey. don't you want a free balloon. it's national free

patrick. we can never go back.  patrick:  goodbye, bikini bottom.  spongebob:  we've only got ourselves and what we can carry on our backs.  patrick:  yup.  spongebob: we're going to have to travel lighter.  patrick: i wanna go home.  spongebob: we can never go home, pat. we're wanted men.  we'll spend the rest of our lives running...running, but at least it's warmer on the fire.  patrick: hey, if we're underwater, how could there be a...  patrick: i'm scared, spongebob.  spongebob: no more nice, warm beds.  patrick: hey.  spongebob:  no more krabby patties.  patrick: oh. spongebob: no more getting mail.   no more gary.   no more movies.  no more squidward.   no more sandy or pearl or mr. krabs.   no more anything.  patrick:  i want ice cream.  spongebob: but it doesn't have to be all bad, right. i mean, at least we have each other. patrick:  yeah. spongebob: and  all that running is good for your buns and thighs, right.  muscleman: ya. buns and thighs.  patrick:  and the bitter cold, it's bracing, isn't it..  spongebob: yeah. maybe being a felon could be...  ...fun.  we can loosen our ties.  patrick: yeah.  and we can fly.  spongebob:  yeah.  spongebob:  okay, we still can't do that.   but at least we don't have to shave.  patrick:  i'm way ahead of you, buddy.  spongebob: and you get to talk tough.   this town ain't big enough for the two of us.  patrick: uh, let me try:  uh...hey, punk.  spongebob: and the best part is: now that we're felons, we don't have to return anything we borrowed.  spongebob and patrick:  yeah.  patrick: and we owe it all to  you.  spongebob: what are you talking about. taking the balloon was your evil plan.  patrick: oh, i'm nothing but a lot of talk. you're the one with the sticky fingers.  spongebob:  aw, patrick...  you're the best bad influence ever. patrick: you, too.  i wish we had something to eat, though. spongebob:  look what i've got. patrick:  rectangles. spongebob: not just any rectangles... candy bars.  patrick: oh.  spongebob: all we have to do is make them last for the rest of our lives.  patrick: thanks spongebob. i think i'll eat it now.  i think i'll eat it now.  ow. who.  where'd my candy bar go.  i must have dropped it.  spongebob: you just ate it, pat. it's all over your face.  patrick:  where'd it go. i'm gonna starve.  where'd it go.  patrick: i can't find it.  where could it possibly be.  ahaha.
