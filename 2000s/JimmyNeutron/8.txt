 that night i was working on an important project.    talk to me.  sheen : hi, jimmy.  are you watching the happy show show.  sheen, i'm kind of busy here.  maybe you could watch it tomorrow or the next day or the next day or the next day or how about the next day or the next...   or the next day or the next day or the next day or the next day or the next day...  i should have known then that something was very wrong.  or the next day.  the next morning at the candy bar, things got really strange.    good morning, jimmy.  i'm very happy today.  are you happy.  bolbi: after you.  oh, no, after you.  let's go at same time.  splendid.    libby, did you just turn some music off.   : hello, jimmy.  i'm happy to see you.  did you watch the happy show showlast night.  you should watch the happy show show,jimmy.  it would make me very happy.  my scientific curiosity had been aroused, so i finally watched the show.  announcer: it'sthe happy show show with your host, grandma taters.  hello, everybody.  i'm so happy to see you, because every time i see you, there's a rainbow in my heart.   no more sadness, no more fears     no more badness, no more tears    just happy, happy, happy, happy, happy all the day.   it was the worst show i had ever seen.   the next day at school, the strangeness continued.  all: hi, jimmy.  hi, jimmy.  you watchthe happy show show.  yes, and it was the worst show ever.  infantile, inane, vapid...  shall i go on.  you need to watch again.  again. i could barely watch 30 seconds.  i thought my tv would explode.  i thought i might faint from the fumes of the show's supreme stinkiness.  you should give it another chance.  guys, are you listening.  i'm never going to watch that show again.  why don't you come over to my house and watch it with me.  beset once again by scitic curiosity, i decided to give the show another try at betty quinlan's house.   grandma taters:  and you'll be happy forever.    ah.   betty's worth it.  betty's worth it.  grandma taters: now...  yes, grandma.  : listen to me.  you will do whatever i say.  telleveryone to watch this show.  : my next broadcast will go out to the entire world.  the show was hypnotizing people and turning them into mindless zombies.  it didn't affect me because i was only watching the reflection.  betty, snap out of it.  you've been hypnotized.  stop watching the tv.  but i must watch, and you must watch, too.    mom, dadwe've got to call someone.  there's a tv show that's turning everyone into...  both: hello, jimmy, we're happy to see you.  you, too.  come sit here, and we'll be happy together.  no....  shall we chase him.  nothing would make me happier.   watch the show.  yes, you must watch it.  it's fabulous.  all: happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy...  grandma taters: be happy, be happy.  : happy... be happy.  no....    why don't you watch where you're going..  cindy, you're not happy.  no, but i'm filthy, andi lost at the karate competition to a sixyearold beigebelt on crutches.  that's great.  what.  you don't understand.  mindless zombies... grandma taters... tv...  mass hypnosis.  that big brain of yours has finally blown a gasket.  let's get out of here before they get us.  someone's riding the paranoid express.  all: get them.  see. like i was saying.  okay, i believe you.  give me the details later.  don't worry, they can't hide from us forever.  what a happy thought.  as we flew to the outskirts of town, i told cindy the whole story.  and that's what happened.  the entire town is happy zombies, and the world may be next.  so, uh...whywere you at betty quinlan's house.  research.  now, i may be able to track the broadcast beam of the tv show and find its originating source.  i got it.  cindy, it's up to us to stop this thing together.  so, um... what did you do at betty's house.  nothing.  good.  i mean golet's go.   jimmy: "the retroville rest home for the old and in the way."  well, mr. fluffy, tonight we will broadcast to the entire world, and soon, everyone will join us.  that's her.  she's so sweet and innocent looking.  yeah, so are child stars.  wait here and keep a lookout for any of the happy ones.  i'm going in to stop her.   grandma taters, i presume.  oh, well, hello, honey.  come on in.  would you like some hard candy.  i know what you're up to, lady.  well, aren't you a smart little boy.  how about i knit you a hat.  what. i...  oh, dear, i'll need a lot more yarn.  i'm shutting you down, grandma.  oh, i didn't want to have to do this.   huh.  guys, stop.  don't worry... be happy.  restraints.  mom, dad, you can't do this to me.  oh, we're happy to do it.  i'm positively ecstatic.  but you're not supposed to be happy all the time.  you have to be sad sometimes.  happily, that's no longer true.  but don't you see.  grandma taters' show has stolen your emotions and caused you to lose your humanity.  soon the whole world will be a pack of soulless, mindless zombies.  wondering if i care.  still wondering... nope.  sit back and relax, sonny.  watch grandma taters do what she does best.   lights.  camera.  cindy.  hello, jimmy.  i'm so happy to see you.  i'm not happy to see you happy.  just surrender to it, jimmy.  it's as simple as one, two, three.   sheen: ow, ow.  heeyah.  you want a piece of me, honey.  bring it, wrinkles.  hi... yah.    jimmy: all right, cindy, just hold up the cue cards when i say "action." right.  and... action.  : hello, dearies.  this is grandma taters.  i was wrong to tell you to be happy all the time.  being different is what keeps us all from being a pack of mindless meat puppets.  here's a song i wrote about it.   be angry if you're feeling mad    and if you're sad, be weepy    but don't be happy all the time    'cause frankly, it's creepy.   oh, dear, i'm talented.  : oh.  now, when i snap my fingers, you'll all go back to the way you were.   hey, why am i tied to carl.  sheen, stop wriggling.  hugh, do something.  i'm not happy about this one bit.  really.  i kind of like it.  i know you meant well, grandma taters, but you should leave mass mind control to trained professionals.  i just wanted everyone to be happy.  i guess i'll be on my way.  but i'm confused.  isn't this where you live.  no, this was just a oneweek gig.  grandma taters: i'm sorry, girls.  i failed.  that's all right, honey.  come in for some muffins.  and brain juice.  we'll be back.  so, um... what were you doing at betty quinlan's house again.  i told younothing.  so why were you going there.  why are you crossexamining me.  oh, so youadmit you had a reason.  cindy, you don't know anything.   jimmy: the great spamdini magic set.  after waiting four weeks for this, it better be worth it.  hey, look at me.  i'm the great sheendini.    never buy a magic kit from wacko wally's wizard warehouse.  this says the great spamdini vanished under mysterious circumstances.  maybe he dabbled too far in the dark arts.  well, he sure dabbled in subpar building materials.   this needs a major neutronic overhaul.  jimmy, why are you suddenly into magic.  oh, i knowi know.  because betty quinlan likes magic and jimmy likes betty quinlan.  carl, you are totally wrong.  i've always been fascinated with prestidigitation.  ow. ow.  sixsyllable words hurt my brain.  it means magic, and i'mnotdoing this to impress betty quinlan.  carl: goddard.  and here's your card.  oh, please.  magic is so lame.  i think magic's awesome.  me, too. i've been doing it for years.  i've been doing it for years.  i've been doing it for years.  man's best friend.  jimmy: so will you guys help me do the magic show.  will i.  magician's assistant is only a few notches below circus geek, my true dream.  i don't know, jimmy, dabbling in the dark arts.  carl, one word: sequins.  ladies and gentlemen.  you've heard of houdini, you've heard of those two foreign guys with the animals...  sheen: carl.  i get to introduce the amazing jimmy.  look at your contract, babe.  oh, man.  the amazing... jimmy.    ladies and gentlemen...  and betty.  i will now present a feat of magic so amazing that all of youbut especially betty...  give me a break.  will be rendered speechless with awe.  i shall need a volunteer.  hmm...  who shall i pick.  just pick betty and get it over with.  how about you, betty.  sure, jimmy.    why do my arms feel like pudding.  can't talk... too much pain.   ain't no lovin' my man    shoowop, shoowop    oohooh, ain't no...    carl, sheen, this is important.  i'm looking for myself.  wow, sounds profound.  have you tried yoga.  no, i mean literally.  when was the last time you saw me.  don't you remember, jimmy.  you were just here ten minutes ago.  you were headed to the lab.  the lab.  oh, no.  while the dork's away, the clones will play, eh, pooch.   you're in big trouble, clone.   step away from that duplicator.  sorry, no can do, bro.  this goodietwoshoes town of yours ain't big enough for the both of us.  waityou don't know how dangerous that thing is.  oh, i think i do.   hasta la vista,big head.  don't worry, goddard, he forgot aboutmyrocket.   i really hate that clone.  hi, jimjam.  getting ready to visit that new planet in the sky.  new planet.  what new planet.   hugh: sure is pretty.  in a creepy, steaming kind of way.  goddard, deploy telescope.  oh, nohe's cloned another earth.  my clone used the flux field to clone a duplicate earth.  oh, let me look, let me look.  ooh, it's all cloney.  uh, jimbo, is this one of your hologramy thingies.  no, dad, it's you.  your electromagnetic field has been disrupted.  you're starting to fade.  oh, my, the same thing is happening to me and goddard.  it looks like the entire planet's electromagnetic field has been disrupted, but i'm still solid.  evil jimmy screened me out of the cloning process.  figures.  he doesn't want more jimmys around.  hey, look at me.  i'm light as a feather.   i've only got 90 minutes to retrieve the flux field and reverse the process before everyone fades.  this magnet will solidify the rocket.  hugh: whee....  next stop: cloned earth.   evil jimmy is somewhere on that new planet.  if i find him, i can shut all this down.  that's weird.  the cloned retroville isn't an exact copy.  man: have a rotten day.  man: go jump in a lake.    leaping leptons.  evil jimmy has made his cloned earth just as evil as he is.  better blend in.   oh, yeah, i'm evil.  oh, yeah, i'm bad.  look out.  young man, that was brave and decent of you.  : what are you, some kind of sicko..  help.  a goodie.  you freak.   uhoh.   i think he went this way.  well, this place is unsafe, unsanitary and crawling with vermin.  congratulations, you passed your health inspection.  i aim to displease, yeah.  welcome to sam's.  what's your evil pleasure.  "roadkill ripple.  moles and cream." um, i'll just have the usual.  there you goa big heaping bowl of batwing sherbert.  mmm, delicious.  delicious.  i'll have you know it stinks.  hey, are you sure you're evil.   uh, well, you want evil, fat boy.  i'll give you evil.  take this, and that, and more of this.  that's for your mother and this is for you.  any more questions.  no, no, you... you're evil, all right, yeah.  uh, no, yeah.  so remind me, tubby, when was the last time you saw me.  about a half an hour ago.  you said you were headed for school.  school, huh.   thanks for nothing, you gelatinous waste of space.  get lost, and don't come back soon.  okay, who had the peppermint kidney stones.  the evil thickens.  no sign of my clone anywhere.  only he can lead me to the flux field.   i thought i told you to stay out of my hallway.  carl, look, i don't want any trouble.  well, you got trouble, you doeyeyed moke.  you're mine, shrimp dip.  it's time you found out who's the baddest, toughest kid in school.  sheen: evil jimmy, evil carl, look what i've got.  it's my new robofiend with tracheacrushing fun claw.  i love robofiend.  he's my idol.   get inside, dirt bag.   take your seats, maggots.  evil cindy and evil libby will now give a presentation on wedgies.  thank you, ugly.  nothing hurts like a wedgie, and yet few people understand the proper technique.  may we have a volunteer,nick.  no, you can't.  : i'll get you for this.  assume the position.  simply reach, grab and give a forceful 90degree tug.   note the beads of paininduced sweat.  sheen, when was the last time you saw me.  ow.  gotcha.  i think we need another volunteer.  yeah, like, um, jimmy.  i'd really rather not.  ow.  okay, okay.  for a truly memorable wedgie, apply a set of common household jumper cables.  what.. no way.  hold him, evil libby.  come here, you.     class: wow.  very evil, jimmy.  very evil indeed.  um... thanks.   miss fowl, miss fowl, evil jimmy just thanked you.  yeah, he was being totally polite.  young man, i won't stand for politeness in my class.  you leave me no choice but to break out...  the board of education.  this is less than ideal.  after him.  fly, my pretties, fly.  maybe my evil parents will hide me.  after all, they'restillmy parents.  sheen: get him. get him.  somebody get him.  somebody get him.  judy: hello, sweetie.  home so soon.  i'm just dirtying up the house before dinner.   we're having duck again.  i must have bagged over 87 bubbleheads this morning.  oh, they quacked for mercy, but i just laughed and laughed.   this is going to scar me for life.   mom, dad, i know helping is good, and i know that you're evil, but i'm still your son, right.  yeparoonie, our very, very good son.  our evil son has ordered us to capture you for experimentation.    evil jimmy: well, well, well, if it isn't the wimpy, dipheaded freak.  hey, nice of you to drop by.  i see you met the folks.   so... what do you think of my little world, doc.  it's sick, twisted and smells like old socks.  how did you make this duplicate earth evil.  with a darkmatter power chip.  yeah, i know, feel free to applaud.  don't do this, evil clone.  if the duplication process isn't reversed, my entire home planet will fade into oblivion.  bingo, einstein, in about 59 seconds.   wave byebye to loserville.  jimmy: the shrink ray.  evil goddard, think fast.   evil jimmy: where'd he go.  find him.   blast him, you tinplated mutt.  no, i'm the real evil jimmy.  blast him.   you rustbitten robohound, i'm shutting you down.    almost out of time.    now.  ah, goodbye, mild backache.  oh.  hello, blindingly painful backache.  jimmy: yes.  i undid the duplication process.  now my earth will grow more solid as this one starts to fade.  yeah, well, don't get too proud of yourself, sunshine.  i still got a trick or two up my sleeve.  if you break that chip, the whole planet will get sucked into the darkmatter dimension.  and you'll be trapped with us.  catch you on the flip side, wimpy dip.    i can't outrun it.  where's that rocket.  hey, jimbo, everything is all thick and chunky again.  did you make it to that planet.  did you ever see our duplicate house.  i sure did, dad, and it made me realize that i don't need to beat da vinci's record.  i'd rather spend extra time with my friends and my family.  oh, that's sweet.  i can pencil you in for next tuesday.  carl and sheen:  ain't no lovin' my man    shoowop, shoowop    ooh, ain't no lovin' my man...   carl, sheen, they've somehow become hypnotized again.  oh, we're not hypnotized.  we're just slaves to the rhythm.  yep, we're two sassy mamajamas.  both:  ain't no lovin' my man    shoowop, shoowop    ain't no lovin' my man    shoowop, shoowop...     shoowop, shoowop.   at least my evil clone is gone for good.  no one has ever come back from a darkmatter dimension.   you're not going to get away with this, wimpy dip.  you can't keep an evil clone down.  i'll be back.   ppt phlpt $<x)he $x) <x) <x) <x)x<x)x<x)p<x)p<x)p<x)p<xf @<<<<<<<<<< @< @ (]@@@@@@@ got to blast.   into the stars, goin' by candy bar's    rides a kid with a knack for invention    with a superpowered mind, a mechanical canine     he rescues the day from sure destruction    this is the theme song    for jimmy neutron.      lode  jimmy. jimmy.  i've detected aliens with your new telescope.  they're gross and bloated with horrible suede tentacles.  sheen, you've got the telescope pointed at carl's mole.  it's not a mole. it's a beauty mark.  i'm putting cream on it.  wow, the universe is so vast and intricate.  i'm bored.  hmm.  libs, keep an eye on mars for me.  it's been acting weird all night.   is that...  eau d'amino acid.  girl, you brought us here just so you could flirt with jimmy.  did not.  i'm here because jimmy values my scientific input.  why don't those two just get a lab.  hey, neutron, have you checked out mars.  huh.  mars is old news.  i'm spotting comets.  but it's been showing huge fluctuations in brightness.  definitely worth a good long look.   what's that bewitching scent.  you mean my perfume.  i just splash this o when i don't care what i smell like.  mmm...  i mean, oh, look, a comet.   you do this every time.  you invite me someplace and then you ignore my contributions.  can't talk.  taking star pictures.    when a colleague suggests that you look at mars, it's polite to look at mars.  there.  see..  pretty.   i told you mars was acting weird.  good thing the scope was taking pictures.  goddard, download images.  jimmy: holy heisenberg.  look at the size of that flare.  check it out, everybodyit's new year's on mars.  happy martian new year.   ew.  at least i won't be alone again like last year.  it's not new year's, you dipstick.  it's some kind of energy beam firing out into space.  jimmy: and not just any energy, hydroquantum energy.  hydroquantum.  i read about that stuff.  you could power an entire city with just one ice cube.  or the world with just one flush of the toilet.  to mars.  sorry. am i getting ahead of everyone.  of course, if i did go to mars and tap into the hydroquantum, i could shatter every known boundary of science.  excuse me.  anyone else notice the earth shaking.    it's a space invasion.  there's only one hope: we must appease them.  o great alien masters, we worship you.  please destroy someone else.  may i suggest the french.  voice: attention, interlopers, prepare to be stomped.  that's no alien.  excuse me, this is a private party.  voice: is that who i think it is.  how delicious.   hello, neutron.  it's that spoiled rich kid who has it in for jimmy.  eustace strych.  i thought you were grounded for life.  yes, well, my daddy's will is easily manipulated.  so, jimmy, did you forget that i'd sworn everlasting vengeance against you.  hmm, it sort of slipped my mind because i have a life, you loser.  don't get saucy with me.  you're on strych property.  state your business.  don't do it, jimmy.  don't tell him about the limitless power source you found on mar...  and we're not going there to get the limitless power source if that's what you're think...  mars.  sorry, i just get excited.  neutron, old bean, you're keeping secrets.  that's not at all polite.  blixcapture mode.  jawohl, herr strych.  think i'll take this mob yours back to my lab for a good mind shifting.        don't delete us.  : i'm so insane.      oh, the pain.  too bad, old bean.  hope your killer tripod was insured.  tata.  you won't escape, neutron.  my undying hatred shall pursue you without rest.  but first, i think i'll slip into unconsciousness.  more schnitzengrueber, carl.  danke.  good job, goddard.  we should be ready to leave in about three days.  okay, neutron, we're here for our mission briefing.  cindy.  what did you do to your face.  oh... just some radiationproof lip gloss and eyeliner.  deep space is rough on a girl's skin, you know.   uh... i don't know.  i mean, it doesn't matter, you're not coming.  what. but you're taking cand sheen, and all they do is sit around eating schnitzengrueber.  soybased lowcarb schnitzengrueber.  yeah, this guy was giving out free samples.  we even got complimentary schnitzengrueber forks.  mmm...  it's so light, i don't even have to loosen my new stretch pants.  well, sheen and carl won't distract me.  i mean, not that you distract me.  why would you distract me.  that would be silly.  look, neutron, i discovered that flare, i put on space makeup and i'm coming to mars.  clear.  fine.  whatever.  just... just stay out of my way.  do you think he likes my lip gloss.  you are ill, girl.  well, if you have to come along, here's the deal.  here's mars just as the flare erupted.  you can see the energy source located right here.  mmm... mmm...   i knew those chuckleheaded plebeians couldn't pass up free schnitzengrueber.  that is because i make themmitlove.  i want the tripod repaired and modified in three days.  when neutron arrives on mars, he's going to find a little surprise waiting for him.  carl:oh, no, i forgot my inhaler.  jimmy: carl, we're already here.  ready for landing sequence.  do you like my new flight suit, libby.  it's perfect for resisting the strong martian winds.  whatever.  huh. think i've been staring at you the whole trip.  well, i haven't.  well, no one asked you to.  well, fine...  stop annoying me.  what. you rude little twerp.  i'll knock you all over the asteroid belt.    what's going on.   we've been hit by proton blasts.  systems are offline.  : we're dead in space.  who's doing this.  i'm guessing it's that guy.   oh, no.  it can't be.  hello again, jimmy.  what do you want, strych.  do you have a spare inhaler.  i know all about the energy source, james, and i intend to make its power my own.  hydroquantum energy will make me the most powerful 11yearold in the solar system.  i shall rule the red planet as the first king of mars.   eustace, as your mortal enemy, let me just say...  get some therapy.  blix, blow them out of space. )
