coming to you live with this breaking news.  the citizens of fairy world are waiting ..     as they're about to get the answer to the question that's on everyone's mind.  what did baby poof buy at the mall.     we just came to buy diapers.  for cosmo.   i was out.   wow.  i keep forgetting what a big celebrity poof is.   well, he is the only fairy baby in existence.      aww.   being a celebrity is great.  you get to be famous without having any skill or talent whatsoever.      you might want to back off, people.  when poof cries, bad things happen.   how could this adorable baby possibly make a bad thing happen.  click.         timmy, wanda, and poof what about me.   oh, and you too, carl.  it's great to have you visiting again.  and we want to welcome you back anytime as long as you bring poof.  because without him, you wouldn't be news, and without news, i'd have to get a real job.  for the fairy channel, i'm fairy hart wishing you all a fairy good night.   my name's not carl.  zap.   fairies.  they get all the press.  why.  antifairies have accomplished so much: spiders, paper cuts, pink eye, crazy cow disease.   that was all us.  good day, my evil little crumpet.     if i were you, i'd slow down a bit on those throw pillow sandwiches.  that's your third one this morning.   i can't help myself.  i got cravings.   as do i.  i crave equality.  according to this chart, there's supposed to be an antifairy for everyone fairy.  i'm anticosmo.  you're antiwanda.  there's even an antijorgen.   i made macaroni wind chimes. heehee.    why, then, is there no antipoof.  wait a minute.  hold the phone.   i can't.  i ate it.   twitching stomach.  snacking on houseware.  antibarf.  this can only mean one thing.  there is going to be an antipoof.  you're going to have an antibaby.    i'm so happy i could 'splode.  boom.     guys, why is there a big scary cloud coming toward us.   this is bad, sport.  my motherly instincts tell me there's been a terrible disturbance in the fairy force.   my motherly instincts tell me that we're going to need more diapers.  three, two, one.  yep. we need more diapers.      well. well.  where is it. where is my antibaby.   he's right over there.  the little darling.       hello, clarice.  i mean, mother.   ooh. he said his first words.  our baby.   i'm bored of you already.   ow.  he's pointy.  i'm going to call him gator.   i prefer "the dark harbinger of the doom " of course that name will never fit on a birthday cake.   no, silly.  you're the opposite of baby poof, and therefore your name must be foop.  hm.  that sounded much more evil in my head.   wait a moment.  who is this "poof" you speak of.  am i not the only fairy baby in existence.   well, you're the only square one.   so there is another.   it's story time, father.  tell me more of my new archenemy.  i mean, this other fairy baby.   poof is a very cute and powerful fairy baby, beloved throughout the universe.   and as his opposite, i will be feared and despised.  and i will not share the spotlight with another fairy baby.  zap.  there can be only one.   oh, look.  his first act of unbridled rage.  where's the camera.   ah, you ate that too, you ninny.   father, where is poof now.   he's in fairy world.   and that's where i shall go.  prepare for takeoff.  time for a play date of doom.   there will be no such thing, mister.  in time, we will bring fairy world to its knees and rule the universe.  but we will do it together as a family.   i will do it alone, father.  you see, i don't play well with others.  zap.   well, mr. grumpy pants.  looks like somebody needs a nap.   hear this and hear it good, father.  i am the boss of me, and i do not )
