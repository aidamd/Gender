'tis a highpitched, almost annoying kind of sound.   so, chief, 970 sea monkeys go into the water.  none come out.  june 3, 1999.  and that's why they call me "betty." okay, i think i missed something.  what's your problem.  he couldn't have been more clearer.  i'll tell you what's clear: you're a loony old boat jockey with salt on the brain.  know what else.  this voyage is over unless someone can explain in the next ten seconds how a giant reptilian monster could possibly exist in a manmade freshwater ecosystem.  yahoy, jimbo.  dad.  hi there, sport.  just dumping some of the runoff from your lab.  but, dad, that's highly contaminated chemical sludge.  how long have you been doing this.  oh, the last few years or so.  well, got to get rowing.  byebye now.  this could be very bad.  uh, jimmy.  i think we need a bigger boat.  jimmythat was my turtle.  that was snappy.  oh, nothe contaminants from my lab must have mutated him.  snappy is the lake monster.         hang

freeze charges.  pull, chief, put your back into it.  deploying the freeze charges.   i think it's working.  once we get snappy encased in ice, i'll feed him this demutation pellet.  oh... it won't hurt him, will it.  not at all, carl.  in fact, it should return him to normal.  but... but...  he should have been trapped inside the ice.  what happened.   are you okay, jimmy.  yeah, yeah, bbut where's sheen.  sheen.   sheen: don't worry, mateysi survived by breathing through me peashooter.  peashooter.  that's it.  with a clean shot, we might get this pellet down snappy's throat.  i'll do

interested.  if i were president, i could bring lindbergh school into the 21st century with stateoftheart science.  president sheen.  i'd be an inspiration to c+ students everywhere.  libby, i can't run because of that silly little incident last year.  stuffing the ballot boxes with your name.  that was never proven.  anyway, why don't you run and i'll be your manager.  sounds good to me.  i can redesign this whole school.  willoughby: hiho, class.  we have a new foreign exchange student joining us from bakheristan.  please welcome bolbi stroganovsky.  hello, fellow learners.  call me bolbi.  i pretty much like you.  hhello.  we were just seeing who wanted to run for...  i runi fast.  miss fowl: no, bolbi.  it doesn't mean run around the room.  it means run for the office of class

heard.   top that, neutron.  fellow studentsi'm not going to promise you flashy clothes or polyrhythmic music or...  guacamole bars.  that's because you don't know the secret ingredient.  it's love.  i will promise you thermonuclear lockers, titanium cafeteria trays...   antimatter rest rooms...  well, you sure know a lot of big words, jimmy.  so, don't forget to vote tomorrow, children.  wait,

they're endangered.  noo.  if elected president, my first concern will be llama protection.  do i have your vote.  you got it.  carl: ow.  the pin went inside me.  and just to make sure we understand each other.  um, cindy, you accidentally left a dollar in my hand.  keep it.  why.  you know why.  iii don't.  why are you winking at me.  why did you give me a dollar.  ahh, my brain hurts.  i'm paying you to vote for libby.  oh, i get it.  i will.  but why did you wink.  do you like me.    you're voting for libby.  what is wrong with you.  you can't vote for her.  why not.  i'll give you three reasons.  one, she's a female.  two, she's not a boy.  and three, and most importantly, she's a girl.  but i promised libby i would vote for her and cindy gave me a dollar.  listen, carlitoyou better vote for me or i'll show everybody that embarrassing photo of you at ike's slumber party.   which one.  the one with the bubbles.  you win.  try me.  ow.  that pin went in me, too.  okay, i'll vote for you, sheen.    slap, slap, slap    clap, clap, clap   :  slap, slap, slap    clap, clap, clap.    : ow.   what....  i happened to be in the neighborhood...  hey, why are you wearing libby and sheen and bolbi buttons.  who are you voting for.  i... i... i don't know..  carl, i'm your best friend.  you got to vote for me.  i know, but the money and the picture and slap, slap, slap.  ow.  stop the world, i want to get off.   carl might not vote for me.  well, no problem.  it's just one vote.  : do the right thing.  vote for libby.  i'd better assess the situation scientifically.  goddardemergency poll.   boy 1: i'm not voting for jimmy neutron.  boy 2: me neither.  boy 3: i'm voting for libby.  boy 4: sheen is my man.  jimmy: i'm dead last.  behind bolbi.   slap, slap, slap    clap, clap, clap    slap, slap, slap    clap, clap, clap.   yeah... be the wind.  hey, mr. president.  how goes the campaign.  i'm dead last in the polls.  maybe i laid it on a little too thick with all the science.  well, jimbo, i'm no stranger to politics myself.  i was elected towel boy in junior high.  my motto was "vote for hugh.  "if you can't trust him "with your dirty, smelly, wet laundry towels, whocan you trust." it was hard to fit all that on those little buttons, but i did it.  anyway, what's really important is you have to give a little razzledazzle.  kick out the jamsock it to 'em.   razzledazzle, huh.  election dayi smell victory.   no way.  that is marinated gunkabob.   mmm, just like ferupian trepid used to make.  don't worry, libby.  if you lose today ...  you can still be my first lady.  get a life, sheen.   so where's scienceboy.  probably gave up and isn't even coming to school.   mmm, it's a delicious mist of purple flurp.  and free gum.   confetti in my eyes.   both:  there is a boy    a certain boy    who every single one of you should vote for today    who is this boy.    our pride and joy    he is the best, there's no contest    it's jimmy neutron  hey.   vote for jimmy, he's so cool    make him president of your school    vote neutron.    yay.   the polls are open.  time to vote.   president neutron.  has a nice ring to it, doesn't it.   fowl: i have the election results.  the winner, or should i say winners, are jimmy,sheenand libby.  it's a tie.  oh, it's just like barbra streisand and katherine hepburn at the '68 oscars.  somebody pinch me.  okeydokey.   ...34, 35, 36.  wait a minutesomeone didn't vote.  that person needs to vote to decide the election.  who didn't vote.   why is everyone looking at me.  i couldn't decide, okay..  too much pressure.  carl, you have to vote.  it's your patriotic duty.  there's more youknowwhat if you vote for libby.   best friend.  : palpitations.  hot flashes.  blood pressure rising.  i'm just saying guacamole.    cindy gave me a dollar to vote for libby.  sheen was blackmailing me with a photo.  jimmy was playing the bestfriendcard and using scantily clad women.   it has come to my attention that some of our candidates have been guilty of bribery, blackmail and murder.   sorry, not murder.  i meant to say operating a zeppelin on school premises.  anyway, they're all illegal campaign practices.  jimmy,sheenand libby are disqualified.   oh, man.  we've learned a powerful lesson.   democracy is a fragile butterfly.  it depends on an honest electoral process.  shh, our president is about to speak.   okay, your president says cut the jabber and start the slapping.   slap, slap, slap    clap, clap, clap
