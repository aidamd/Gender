 oking.  go to hyperthrust, fool.  i can'tzix traded in our thrusters for a box of them plutonian swimsuit magazines.  swimsuit magazines. what's with you, fool.  i happen to read them for the articles.  now, hold on while we lose them in one of these star systems.  tee, what's the nearest mclass planet.  tee: earth.  earth.  yeah, fool, earth.  earth it is.  goodwe'll hide out here.  see if there's anything worth stealing...  heylook at the cute little people.  let's go out and squish them.  squish them yourself, fool.  i'm going to make me a people pie.  as usual, i have a better idea.  all we've got to do is capture these little creatures and then...  hey, why are you whispering.  it's more dramatic.   jimmy: citizens of retroville, prepare to return to your normal size.  it's about time.  yeah, make us big, yeah.  zix: they're absolutely adorable.  prepare to suck them into the holding bins.  sorry, ultralady.  perhaps someday society will let people and action figures follow their hearts.  initiating enlargement sequence.  one... two...  may we crash this party.   this is mine.  this would look beautiful in my ma's den.  attention, please.  you are all our prisoners.  to save time, i suggest you don't run around screaming and make us chase you.   no one ever listens.  get 'em.    sheen: in here.  how long do you think we can hide in here.   hey, those are the aliens that tried to steal our astrorubies and almost killed us.  sheen: i can use the ultralord mind control on them.  sheen, no.  you don't need to look in this box.  these aren't the kids you're looking for.  move along.  this talking lunch box is creeping me out.  i'm just going to move along.  jimmy: i don't believe it.  haha, got you, monkey boy.  feel the power of ultralord.  ultralord.  ultralord.  ultralord.  i probably shouldn't have done that.   hey, i got them.   you were bigger the last time i saw you...  but not much.  how would you all like to take a nice, long, terrifying trip.  depends.  will we get any souvenirs.  will we have to go to any boring museums.   will i have to sit next to carl.     young man, you are inhuman.  hush your mouth, old woman.  i pity humans.  does your mother know you're doing this.  no, but when she gets out of prison, i'll tell her.  well, we can all thank our favorite boy genius for getting us into mortal dangeragain.  at least we can say we had an exciting childhood.  hey, lookit's the old mcspanky's burger joint that we used to work at till you shot it at the sun, jimmy.  they've turned it into a spaceship.  it's okay, our worries are over.  we're rich.  i bet they dissect us like frogs.  maybe they're going to make us into pets.  or train us to ride rats in a rat rodeo and travel the galaxy for fame and fortune.  hmm, not a bad idea, but too late.  you're on your way to the third nebula, where you'll be sold to local alien children as toys.  all: toys.  i am not a toy.  i am a human being, and i'm not going to be sold to anybody.   i think you are.  sorry, we got so caught up in the piles of money you're going to make us that we forgot to ask your opinion.  yeah, that was so thoughtless.  why can't i eat one.  that one looks nice and juicy.  please don't eat mei'm not nice and juicy.  well, i am nice, but i'm not juicy.  well, maybe i am, and with a little salt and pepper...  no eating the merchandise.  prepare to blast off.  hmm, i guess i could be a toy.  how does this sound.  : my name is carl, and i want to play with you.  that's a ten on the creepy scale.  well, if we're going to be toys, let's be the best darn toys ever.  dad, you want some alien kid dressing you up and feeding you and bathing you and putting you to bed.  no, that's your mom's job.  look, we're going to be toys, so let's sell our story and get a tv movie out of it.  who's with me.  : argh, i am, me bucko.  listen to me.  we are not going to be toys.  if there's one thing i hate, it's a toy with a bad attitude.  forget it, kid, you're never going back.   goodbye, earth.  goodbye, trees and grass and cartoons and doughnuts and...  don't forget llamas.   three... two... one...  wait a minute, we can't go.  i think i left the sprinklers on.  blast off.  hugh: the water bill is going to be huge.  well, boys, the loot is safely locked away and we're off to get paid.  oh, yeahwe're going to be rich.  now i can marry boofunka and her old man can kiss my photon receptors.  and i can finally open up that dress shop.  we have to get out of here and take control of the ship.  that's impossible.  what can we little squirts do.  you'd be surprised.   that reminds me of something.  oh, the time you got your head caught in the trash compactor.  which time. the first. second. the third.  well, the 19th time was fun, but that's the time i cried.  jimmy: since we're too minuscule for a physical assault, we'll use psychological warfare.  okay, by using found objects, i can cobble together highfrequency microphones...  go on.  an ultrasonic sound transmitter...  yes.  and a compact battery subsystem.  you lost me at "okay." jimmy: we have to get them mad at each other.  by attaching these minitransmitters to their heads, we can pretend to be their conscience.  yeah.  what's a conscience.  i know, i know.  it's a cute little cricket with a hat, and he sings and hangs out with puppets.  okay, no.  a conscience is the voice inside your head telling you right from wrong.  never heard of it.  just say things to get them mad at each other.  i'll do zix. you do travoltron and tee.  zix, this is your conscience.  why split the money with those two inferior boneheads.  it was your ideayou had the brains.  so true it hurts.  hi, mr. alien man, i am your conscience.  hey, coolvoices in my head.  um, zixhe thinks you're a jerk.  and you have stinky feet and you're ugly and i bet he's not even going to get you a birthday present.  no birthday present.  for the last time, travoltron, i do not want a manly hug.  oh, yeah.  how about a knuckle sandwich, you nopresentgiving casazich.  what. that's not even a word.  get back to the controls.  how about you make me.  i don't think you can make me, can you.  testing, testing.  one, two, three.  can you hear me. hello.  mama.  no, this is your conscience.  my what.  some kind of bug that crawled inside your head and busts you when you do something bad.  hmm, you're a bug. in my head.  go over and beat up those other guys.  they think you're dumb.  what.  thanks for the tip, bug in my head.  zix: let go.  i think i'm in control now.  listen up, chumpsyou think i'm dumb.  i got three fingers that says otherwise.   get ready.  stop.  my eye.  can't you see that this senseless fighting is tearing us apart.  you're righti hate it when we argue.  mmm, got a deep love for you fellasbrother love.  it's not working.  but i still think tee is as dumb as a post.  why, you... get your face over here.  now.   dad, close the pod.  let us out of here this instant, you little squirts.  hey, these little squirts just kicked your alien butt.  beaten by sixinch earthlings.  i knew we should've ate them.  set course for earth.  fire rocket blasters.  libby, a ltle traveling music.   jimmy: we're going home.   ladies and gentlemen, i think we've all learned something in the past few days.  size is not important.  it doesn't matter if you're big or if you're small.  so be happy with who you are.   for saving the citizens of retroville from a life as toys, we award the retroville trophy of honor to james isaac neutron.   whoa, whoa, whoa, time out.  may i just remind everybody this was all neutron's fault.  ooh, the loud girl has a point.  chainsaw.   for reminding us that this was all jimmy's
