"you trash it, i cash it." now, let's see what we have here.   three carbonbased water sacks, two quatoos per sec.  relatively worthless.  this is all like some weird dream.  bbut i know i'm not dreaming, because there would be lamas in it and jimmy's mom's...  cookies.  hmm, nice.  heavy metals.  i cut gut the hull and sell it as a toilet to the intestinauts of flatulon five.  what..  nobody uses my rocket ship for a toilet.  um, actually, jimmy, i...    down, roxy, down, girl.  you'll puncture the water sacks, and i just mopped in here.    : oh... baby.  look, junkguy, we're not water sacks, we're humans.  how about you let us go and gives us back the two robots you took from the moon.   a bargaining man.  ooh, i love that in a water sack.  how's about this.  i keep your toilet rocket and fire you out my airlock, hmm.  cool. we get to get shot out of an airlock.  sheen, we won't survive being shot into space.  oh.  but still, an airlock.   junkman: roxy.  bad girl.  you're ruining the polymer.  secure that thing.    goddard.  move.  jimmy. yoohoo.  look, there's brobot's parents.  nice to see you again, jimmy.  how are your folks.  brobot's father: hello, boys.  great view up here.  wish you could see it.  will you gear heads pipe down..  no one likes chatty space junk.  in you go, sackies.  hey, i thought you were going to shoot us into space.  sheen. sheen.  this is a nodumping zone.  i'll wait until we're out of the solar system.  as for you two...  mother: watch the wiring, young fella.  father: i guess we're having dinner with the captain here.  see you, boys.  sheen: bye, have fun with the junkguy.  talk to you soon.  they're goners.    now i know why the caged bird sings.  sorry, guys.  i guess i should have believed brobot.  wish i'd listened to him.  i wish i could see libby's smiling face one more time.  i wish i could see jimmy's mom's smiling...   uh, lemon cookies.  you know, with the faces on them.  oh, yeah.  man, those are good.  i switch my last wish to those cookies.   shhsomeone's coming.  this may be the end.  well, i'm not going down without a fight.  hi, jimmy.  brobot.  hit him. he got us into this.  oh, brobot, for once i'm glad to see you.  i hid on the bottom of your rocket.  see, i told you there was a junkman.  you were right.  sorry i didn't believe you.  that's okay.  i'll get you out.  now you'll help me find my parents, right.  well, brobot, that would be the right thing to do, but the smart thing to do would be to escape in jimmy's rocket, go home and call it a day.  i vote for sheen's idea.  but we can't leave my parents.  you have to save them, jimmy.  brobot saved us, we save his parents.  that's the way it is.  come on.  this is alousy adventure.  now, all we have to do is get brobot's parents, free goddard, find my rocket and blast out of here.  and by "we" you mean "you." usually.  i'll help.  no, no.  you just keep quiet.  i'll watch out for moony men.  carl, zip it.    there.  the kitsch value alone bops the price up to 17 quatoos.  that's twice what i got for my mother.  : mama...  i couldn't put a price on you.  so i took the best offer.  ooh, what do you think, roxy.   father: say, captain.  where's the poop deck.  can we ride on the poop deck.  mother: i just love the word "poop deck." i know what you mean.   can't say "poop" without saying "deck." oh, it just trips off the tongue.   we'll visit the poop deck right after i remodel the annoying, blabbering robots into gravidisks.  oh, that'll be great.  kids love to toss gravidisks.  that they do.   junkman.  ooh.  greetings, gortox the irritable.  never mind that.  where are the gravidisks you promised.  keep your warts on.  i was just about to make them.   jimmy: goddard.  jimmy, lookmy parents.   see.  best gravidisks in the galaxy.  well, send them over pronto.  and when are you going to sell me that roxy of yours.  sell roxy.  the only thing in the galaxy that has ever shown me any love.  any loyalty.  any affection.  my price stands at 100 setloos.  too steep for me.  you'll come back.  give my best to mrs. the irritable.  ciao.  hey, brobot, if we can't rescue your parents in time and they turn into gravidisks, can i have one.  jimmy: sheen.  but they look so cool.  i don't like sheen.  tell me about it.  okay, robots, any last annoying yammering you'd like to get in.  nope, i'm good.  me, too.  good.  then let's recycle.   we've got to grab brobot's parents, but how can we distract the junkman.  hey, jimmy, look.  i can do this.  brobot, you can distract the junkman.  really. i can.  oh, that would be so cool.  i'm a real good distracter.  watch.  hey, mr. junkman, look at me.  i can do a cartwheel.  can you do a cartwheel.  i canhahahere, watch.  well, where did you come from, my highly marketable little fellow.  i'm brobot.  i'm a robot and a brother.  i'm brobot.  yyes, you are.  don't worry, boy, i'll have you out of there in no time.  i say, little friend, do you like gravidisks.  jjjust hold still now.   poop deck.   quite, roxy, i'm a little busy here at the moment.    : oh, baby.  aw, that's sweet.  yet somehow vaguely creepy.  roxy.  bad dog, bad dog, bad dog.  no kissing the new lamp.  hey, the water sacks.  roxy, sic 'em.    ow. ooh, bad girl.  someone is not getting her proton snack tonight.  popbot, mombot, restrain the junkman.  we're on it, jimmy.      he's restrained now.  so, junkmannow the shirt is on the other foot.  it's not over till the plussized martian shoots mucus through her nosrounds.  ooh, did i do that.   i can't control it.  well, of course you can't.  i am the only one who knows how.  release me, and we will all live happily ever after.  i don't trust you.  then, we all crash into the moon and perish on impact.  he makes a forceful argument.  ha.  adios, sackies.  you're coming with me, you traitor.  we'll meet again.  no one can escape the junkman.      junkman: roxy, get me a cough drop.  : can't steer.  prepare to crash.  i'll help, brotherlet me help.  i can help.  thanks, brobot, but i don't think you can do anything.  oh, yeah. watch me.    popbot: too bad that nice junkman couldn't stick around for the treats.  another lunar pie, boys.  lay one on me, mombot.  these are even better than mrs. neutron's lemon cookies.   it's true.  forgive me, judy.  brobot: hey, jimmy.  let's play another game of moon tennis.  aw, but we just played it 12 times.  but it'll be fun.  i'm kind of tired.  please.  one more time. two more times.  three more.  more, more, more....  maybe later.  now. come on.  it'll be fun.  brobot: what do you like better, fun or ice cream.  do you likeficecream.  have you ever eaten a sneaker. i have.  are you ready to play now.  how about now.  now. now.

   and mtv television networks jimmy: hmm, looks like my time accelerator works exactly as i planned.   i can't believe it, sugar booger.  we're finally going to get to seeducksthe greatest musical ever made.   when you're a duck, you're a duck all the way    from the first time you quack    till the last egg you lay.    when you're a duck you live in a blind    with a little o'range and some fresh melon rind.    ducks...    the musical.   judy: now, jimmy.  while we're out tonight, no inviting anyone over, no experiments, and no intergalactic travel.  don't worry, mom, i'll be good.  goodbut just to be safe, sign here... and here... and here...  and initial here.  mom, i'm just doing routine maintenance on my shrink ray, time pincher and time accelerator.  it's going to be a

the show.  uh... no thanks.  sometimes a scientist's lot can be a lonely and boring one, goddard.   saved by the bell.  hey, jimmy, i got the first season ofteenage ultra lord on dvd, with 162 hours of deleted scenes.  yeah.  in one episode, the actors flub their lines with hilarious results.  oh, sorry, guys, i can't.  my parents are out and i can't have anybody over.  your parents are gone.  you're home alone.  they won't be back till ultra lord knows when.  let's have a party.  no, sheen, seriously.  i signed a legal document.  but think of the fun, the laughs, the memories.  think of the highcalorie snacks and sugarladen soda.  oh, it would be fun.  maybe nick would even come and that would make us cooler than cool.  and maybe betty quinlan would come, jimmy.  betty quinlan.   sheen: this is a onceinalifetime chance.  sheen: your parents may never go out again.  hmm... mom and dad didn't say anything about sheen inviting anyone over, so okay.  sheen, i guess it'd be okay if you wanted to just invite a few...  can you keep it down, jimmy.  yeah, you heard me: party at neutron's.  call everybody you ever met in your entire life and tell them to get over here now.  this is going to be the greatest night of our lives.  or a horrible nightmare of pain and misery.  carl, what'd you say that for.  hey, i calls 'em as i sees 'em.  jimmy: ooh, there's the man.  right this way, ladies.  liking the outfit.  glad you could make it.  cindy. libby.  yeah, yeah.  the only reason we're here is to make catty observations and rude remarks.  and there was nothing good on tv.  so, uh...  like, where's the party, nerdbomb.  uh, well, it's right here.  this is it.  what.  no music, no dancing, no decorations.  no little weenies in little buns.  leave it to neutron to throw a totally lame party.  what about games.  we could play spin the bottle.  yeah, or we could play spin sheen and hit him with a bottle.  oh, wwwait, i've got some cool games: rock 'em sock 'em einstein and, oh, stephen hawking's offroad baja wheelchair race.  i'll be right back.  hey, don't forget the little weenies.  i officially declare this party over.  i am out of here.  no, no.  if nick goes, they all go.  i got to stop him.  get out of my way, shine.  "sheen." whatevermove.  wait, wait, wait.  jimmy has cool stuff like... like a jet pack.  and you'd look cooler than cool flying around in that.  please stay.  don't leave.  kids: wow.  let the party begin.  jimmy: let's see, i got games, doublefudge popcorn, purple slurp...   that can't be good.   hey, wheezer, what happens if i point this at you and press the button.  don't, don't.  you'll make me real...  ...small.  help.    hey, check me out, dudes.  i'm super nick.  libby: check this out.  live satellite feed of the men pretending to be boys concert.    hey, jimmy.  i used your time pincher to bring harry houdini to your party to do magic tricks.   sheen, that's a ferocious prehistoric velociraptor.  oh, yeah.  i always get magicians and dinosaurs mixed up.     carl: don't step on me.   okay, that's it.  this party is over.  everybody out.  uh, hey, jimmy.  bbbetty quinlan.  who invited miss i'msobeautifulandperfect.  i heard you were having a party.  yes, i am.    i love this song.  you want to dance.  uh, danceme, with you.  here, tonight, in real life.  i mean, it's not april fool's.  i'm not dreaming.  this isn't an elaborate practical...  why would anyone want to dance with nerdtron.  i wouldn't dance with him if he were the last kid on earth.  methinks the lady doth protest too much.  methinks you better button your yap before i button it for you. )
