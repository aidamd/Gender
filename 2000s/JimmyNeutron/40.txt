the beautiful noise that my shoes made when i walked.   uhhuh. that's, uh, great, dad.  but there's a danger hidden beneath the glamour, son.  a man in uniform is a powerful thing.  don't abuse your position or it could be really, really...  oh, what do they call it.  ...not good.  principal willoughby, can't you get someone else to be hall monitor.  jimmy, did you know that the old man you like so much with the funny hair and the big brain and the "e equals mcsquared" thingy was a hall monitor.  albert einstein was a hall monitor.  well, i've never read that in the 178 biographies i've read about him.  oh, it's a hundred percent true.   good luck.  einstein was a hall monitor.  you know what they say about a man in uniform, libby.  well, it's a lie.  once a nerdtron, alwaysa nerdtron.  careful, cindy.  jimmy's "the man" now.  he can get us into trouble.  i can.  oh, oh, yeah.  i can.  cut the chitchat, ladies.  moving it along, and rememberi'm keeping an eye on you.   hey, watch

you've committed a fashion infraction.  goddard, obtain pants' measurement data.  11 3/4 inches.  too short for pants, yet too long for shorts.  a direct violation of the lindbergh elementary fashion treaty of '97.  why don't you do something useful and arrest yourself for being a dork.  is that music you're listening to.  : yeah.  it's the new song by the cute multicultural boys with no attitude.  there is no pop, punk, funkhouse, blues, rock, roll oldies or easy listening allowed in the halls.  goddard, confiscate.  uhoh...  music withdrawal.   skin... feeling... clammy.   whoa, that was on the harsh side.  do you have a problem, citizen.  what's in the gym bag.  wwhat.  hey, jimmy, it's methe sheenster.  cut me some slack, homefly.  goddard, xray.  ultra lord comic, ultra lord action

you are going down.  uh, jimmy, i'm not doing anything wrong or bbbad or evil, am i.  you have exceeded the amount of llama stickers on your lunch box.  i know, but...  but i got a special permit.  shh.  i think your friend's hat is on a little too tight.  his hats are always too tight.  look at his head.  maybe we should get principal willoughby.  are you conducting a secret meeting.  is this a conspiracy to start a riot.  up against the wall. spread 'em.  ookay, neutron, you're out of control.  i'm making a citizen's arrest.  i want a public defender.  i want my music.  i want my mommy.
