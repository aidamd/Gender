 i see wind blowing from the frozen layer of dr. lipbe.  ultralord can't maintain altitude.  he's plummeting to the ground.  no.  ouch.  : son, must you belt your father with tiny flying men.  sorry, dad, but flying ultralord is all i have.  swimming ultralord is rusted and tunneling ultralord suffered a wormrelated mishap.  i brought you here to learn air conditioning, so that one day this company can be "estevez & son." air conditioning's boring.  if ultralord needed cooling, he would shoot freeze charges from his elbows ke in episode 212, ultralord versus the cajun chefs.  here you go, son.  carl: a paperclip sculpturewow, thanks, dad.  you're the best dad in the whole world.  here, son, an actual rotary coil with the original grease.  no, thanks.  i only play with licensed ultralord products.  i understand.  hey, son, what do you say we knock off for the day and play cards or checkers or polish our shoes until the shine is blinding.  uh, e, d, uh, i've kind of got homework to do, so...  jimmy: sheen. carl.  ready to seeultralord franchise film number 24.  but with eight minutes of new footage.  eight glorious minutes.  see you, dad.  how can i ever compete wi this ultralord.  sheen: and then when ultralord vanquished the terrordroids and they used footage from the last movie with the three terrordroids and digitally added a fourth, i thought i'd jump up and hug the screen.  you did.  llo, boys.  did you enjoy the cinema.  did we ever.  ultralord is the coolest superhero in all history.  oh, he's good, but i know a superhero who is better than ultralord.  : better than ultralord.  your words are strange and confusing.  well, i'm not supposed to reveal this...  but it is i myself.  you. you. you.  yes, im...  el magnfico.  well, uh... sure is hot out here.  can i get you some water, mr. estevez.  i am not dehydratedi am el magnfico.  look, here's a picture.  jimmy: yeah.  well, uh...  irrefutable photographic evidence.  now, about that water.  come on, dad.  if you're a superhero, prove it.  let's see some powers.  i... um...  well, i, uh...  i'd be happy to show you, uh...  tomorrow.  at noon.  uh, i, uh... i got to go.  okay, that was weird.  the should last through my experiments.   jimmy: mr. estevez.  jimmy, please, i need your help.  you've got to give me superpowers by noon tomorrow or my son will despise me.  sheen says you're a science whiz, so, pleasewhiz.  well, uh, i'd love to help, but giving you superpowers would go completely against scientific protocol.  please, jimmy.  all any father wants from his son is respect.   hugh: it's okay, everybody, just a little piebased accident.  how long can meringue burn anyway.  am i right.  i can understand a son wanting to respect his father.  but sheen's probably already forgotten you said that stuff.     he rescues the day from sure destruction   help.   this is the theme song     for jimmy neutron.      announcer: it's wrestlepalooza featuring lumberjack vs. manwoman.  gentlemen, we're living large.  kicking back with our bad selves watching mindnumbing television.  lumberjack doesn't stand a chance against manwoman's bonecrushing girlie slaps.  : jim... my.  jimmy, help.  uh... was that brobot.  you mean that robot you made because you wanted a brother who drove you crazy, so you made robot parents and sent them to the moon.  brobot: the moony men are attacking us.  help us, jimmy.  yup, that was him.  want a drink.  i have classic purple flurp, diet, and new improved purple flurp with more purple.  jimmy, aren't you going to help brobot.  no, i'm not going to help him.  he was a major pain.  but he's your brother.  yeah, he's your own nuts and bolts and circuits.  you got to save him before the moony men rip him apart.  brobot can take care of himself.  i provided him with selfpreservation circuitry.  brobot: jimmy, i forgot to tell youthey've disabled my selfpreservation circuitry.  oh. i guess we're going to the moon.  come on, guys.  what. i'm not going.  yeah, what are you, nuts.  there's moony men up there.  well, i'm not going alone, so we'll just sit here until you guys decide what you want to do.  no tv.  nuhuh.   okay, i'm bored.  me, toolet's go.  batteries to power...  ooh, wait, jimmy.  i want to say it.  go ahead.  batteries to power.  turbines to speed.  and... kick it, homey.  hey, say it right.  : lift off.   hey, jimmy, i've got something to ask you.  why don't we have to wear helmets in outer space.  good question, sheen, and the answer is quite interesting.  you see...   moon, moon, moon    spoon, spoon, spoon    june, june, june    spittoon, spittoon, spittoon.   uh, really. mmhmm.  and how come we don't need oxygen tanks and stuff.  well...   star, star, star    you're so far, far, far    can't go by car, car, car...   fascinating. thanks.  did you have any more questions.  noi kind of have a headache.  jimmy, can i stay on the rocket so i don't have to have to see the moony men.  carl, you're such a big baby.  what if they're really coollooking, with the ability to spit acid into our brains through our ears.  yeah, you're right.  then it's settledyou guys go brobot while i stay here and tidy up.  hey, why do you get to tidy up.  i'm the tidier around here.  i want to tidy...  guys.  cut it out.  let's take care of the situation quickly and get back home.  the less time with brobot the better.  you have issues with him, don't you.  this is where his signal came from.  which means the moony men could be anywhere.  yeah.  lurking in the shadows...  watching, waiting, whittling, waltzing, weaving...  sheen, stop it.  you know those "w" words scare me.  or one ofuscould be a moony man.  agh. sheen's a moony man.  oryoucould be a moony man.   i'm a moony man.  stop me before i hurt me.  guys.  both: sorry.   wwhat was that.  i don't know.  i'd better check it out with my neutroscope.  there's something out there.  what should we do, jimmy.  the way i see it, we have three choices: cry, run, or have an embarrassing accident.  i may do all three.   here, let me look.  sheen: oh, don't worry, guys, he's tiny and really far away.   oh.    shh. don't move.  his senses may be so basic that he won't detect us.  he's going to take his head off and he's going to throw it at us   oh, you guys were totally scared.  haha, haha, haha.  ooh, i kill me.  good idea, come here...  wait, sheen, no.  i'm so glad you guys are hereespecially you, big brother.  i'm going to give you a big hug.  brobot, get down.  where are the moony men.  moony men.   oh, there are no such things as moony men.  i made them up.  oh...  no moony men, yay.  dang, what a ripoff.  i want a refund.  ah, see, you hadn't answered my 647 messages and i wanted to play with you.  so i decided to play a funny trick.   now you laugh.  it's not funny.  you know, this reminds me of that story, "the boy who cried lama." "wolf." where..  what story are you talking about.  is it about a goose that doesn't fit in.  or maybe a magic pickle.  oh, oh, tell me the story.  tell me the story. tell me the story.  i'll tell it.  kid cries "wolf." people come.  no wolf. kid laughs. he made it up.  real wolf comes, kid yells. people don't come, and...  la, la, la, ladon't tell me the ending, i haven't finished the book.  the kid's wolf food.  sheen.  that wasn't a good story.  neither was yours, brobot.  come on, guys, we're going home.  brobot: wait.  can't you stay and play, brother.  oh, please, please, please, please.  no, i'm not staying.  you did a bad thing, brobot.  a very bad thing.  i'm sorry, jimmy.  three, two, one.  brobot. wait up.  i knew it.  push over.  i suppose we could stay and collect selenium crystals for a few minutes.  how many minutes60 kabillion minutes.  a few minutes.  hooray.   i'll help you, jimmy.  i'll get my pail and my shovel and be right back.  oh, i can't believe he lured us all the way up here with that stupid story.  yeah, what a little jerk.  carl: i don't know, i think brobot's kind of cute.  you think everything's cute.  well, you think ultralord is cute.  i do not.  yes, you do, you told me.  no, let me clarify.  i saidbabyultralord is cute.  yeah, he is.  hey, can i borrow your baby ultralord doll when we get home.  he's an action figure.  just for that, you can't borrow him.  guys, i need you to focus.  hmm... space clouds.  that's rare this time of year.  jimmy. help.  help.  now what.  jimmy, the junkman is here.  he took my parents and sucked them into his ship.  what did i say about making up stories.  ooh, ooh, i know.  they should have a strong opening, a solid middle, and a satisfying ending.  i'm not making it up, jimmy.  the junkman is realhe's horrible and scary.  come on, guys, let's get out of here and let brobot play his little games by himself.  no, jimmy, come back. wait.  boy, brobot was really upset.  yeah.  he'll be severely emotionally scarred for the rest of his life.  any salty snacks on board.  hey, you guys, what if brobot's telling the truth and there really is a junkman.  come on.  the junkman.  sounds like a villain on a lame tv show that people watch because they have no lives.  like sheen and the ultralord show.  yeah.  hey.  if we travel at hyperspeed, we can still see the last ten minutes of wrestlepalooza.  and lumberjack will make manwoman eat sap.  uh, so, jimmy.  how come it takes astronauts days to go to and from the moon, but it only takes us a few minutes.  another good question.  you see, it all has to do...   goodbye, moon    i'll see you next june    call the milky for us soon, and...   carl.  enough with the song.   jjjimmy... wwwhat's happening.  i don't know.  engine functions seem normal.  man.... this thing needs new shocks.   i can't control it. what's happening.  we're being eaten by a giant space cloud.  that's no space cloud.   where are we.  it's like some sort of space motel, only without the little soaps.  and tiny shampoos.  and towels of all sizes.  and the drinking glasses with the cute little paper hats on them.   that's iti'm getting a new travel agent.   so glad you could join me.  please allow me to introduce myself.  i am...  the junkman.    jimmy:the junkman.  purveyor of fine refuse products throughout the galaxy.  "you trash it, i cash it." now, let's see what we have here.   three carbonbased water sacks, two quatoos per sec.  relatively worthless.  bbut i know i'm not dreaming, because there would be lamas in it and jimmy's mom's...  cookies.  hmm, nice.  heavy metals.  i cut gut the hull and sell it as a toilet to the intestinauts of flatulon five.  what..  nobody uses my rocket ship for a toilet.  um, actually, jimmy, i...    down, roxy, down, girl.  you'll puncture the water sacks, and i just mopped in here.    : oh... baby.  look, junkguy, we're not water sacks, we're humans.  how about you let us go and gives us back the two robots you took from the moon.   a bargaining man.  ooh, i love that in a water sack.  how's about this.  i keep your toilet rocket and fire you out my airlock, hmm.  cool. we get to get shot out of an airlock.  sheen, we won't survive being shot into space.  oh.  but still, an airlock.   junkman: roxy.  bad girl.  you're ruining the polymer.  secure that thing.    goddard.  move.  jimmy. yoohoo.  look, there's brobot's parents.  nice to see you again, jimmy.  how are your folks.  brobot's father: hello, boys.  great view up here.  wish you could see it.  will you gear heads pipe down..  no one likes chatty space junk.  in you go, sackies.  hey, i thought you were going to shoot us into space.  sheen. sheen.  this is a nodumping zone.  i'll wait until we're out of the solar system.  as for you two...  mother: watch the wiring, young fella.  father: i guess we're having dinner with the captain here.  see you, boys.  sheen: bye, have fun with the junkguy.  talk to you soon.  they're goners.    now i know why the caged bird sings.  sorry, guys.  i guess i should have believed brobot.  wish i'd listened to him.  i wish i could see libby's smiling face one more time.  i wish i could see jimmy's mom's smiling...   uh, lemon cookies.  you know, with the faces on them.  oh, yeah.  man, those are good.  i switch my last wish to those cookies.   shhsomeone's coming.  this may be the end.  well, i'm not going down without a fight.  hi, jimmy.  brobot.  hit him. he got us into this.  oh, brobot, for once i'm glad to see you.  i hid on the bottom of your rocket.  see, i told you there was a junkman.  you were right.  sorry i didn't believe you.  that's okay.  i'll get you out.  now you'll help me find my parents, right.  well, brobot, that would be the right thing to do, but the smart thing to do would be to escape in jimmy's rocket, go home and call it a day.  i vote for sheen's idea.  but we can't leave my parents.  you have to save them, jimmy.  brobot saved us, we save his parents.  that's the way it is.  come on.  this is alousy adventure.  now, all we have to do is get brobot's parents, free goddard, find my rocket and blast out of here.  and by "we" you mean "you." usually.  i'll help.  no, no.  you just keep quiet.  i'll watch out for moony men.  carl, zip it.    there.  the kitsch value alone bops the price up to 17 quatoos.  that's twice what i got for my mother.  : mama...  i couldn't put a price on you.  so i took the best offer.  ooh, what do you think, roxy.   father: say, captain.  ere'the poop deck.  can we ride on the poop deck.  mother: i just love the word "poop deck." i know what you mean.   can't say "poop" without saying "deck." oh, it just trips off the tongue.   we'll visit the poop deck right after i remodel the annoying, blabbering robots into gravidisks.  oh, that'll be great.  kids love to toss gravidisks.  that they do.   junkman.  ooh.  greetings, gortox the irritable.  never mind that.  where are the gravidisks you promised.  keep your warts on.  i was just about to make them.   jimmy: goddard.  jimmy, lookmy parents.   see.  best gravidisks in the galaxy.  well, send them over pronto.  and when are you going to sell me that roxy of yours.  sell roxy.  the only thing in the galaxy that has ever shown me any love.  any loyalty.  any affection.  my price stands at 100 setloos.  too steep for me.  you'll come back.  give my best to mrs. the irritable.  ciao.  hey, brobot, if we can't rescue your parents in time and they turn into gravidisks, can i have one.  jimmy: sheen.  but they look so cool.  i don't like sheen.  tell me about it.  okay, robots, any last annoying yammering you'd like to get in.  nope, i'm good.  me, too.  good.  then let's recycle.   we've got to grab brobot's parents, but how can we distract the junkman.  hey, jimmy, look.  i can do this.  brobot, you can distract the junkman.  really. i can.  oh, that would be so cool.  i'm a real good distracter.  watch.  hey, mr. junkman, look at me.  i can do a cartwheel.  can you do a cartwheel.  i canhahahere, watch.  well, where did you come from, my highly marketable little fellow.  i'm brobot.  i'm a robot and a brother.  i'm brobot.  yyes, you are.  don't worry, boy, i'll have you out of there in no time.  i say, little friend, do you like gravidisks.  jjjust hold still now.   poop deck.   quite, roxy, i'm a little busy here at the moment.    : oh, baby.  aw, that's sweet.  yet somehow vaguely creepy.  roxy.  bad dog, bad dog, bad dog.  no kissing the new lamp.  hey, the water sacks.  roxy, sic 'em.    ow. ooh, bad girl.  someone is not getting her proton snack tonight.  popbot, mombot, restrain the junkman.  we're on it, jimmy.      he's restrained now.  so, junkmannow the shirt is on the other foot.  it's not over till the plussized martian shoots mucus through her nosrounds.  ooh, did i do that.   i can't control it.  well, of course you can't.  i am the only one who knows how.  release me, and we will all live happily ever after.  i don't trust you.  then, we all crash into the moon and perish on impact.  he makes a forceful argument.  ha.  adios, sackies.  you're coming with me, you traitor.  we'll meet again.  no one can escape the junkman.      junkman: roxy, get me a cough drop.  : can't steer.  prepare to crash.  i'll help, brotherlet me help.  i can help.  thanks, brobot, but i don't think you can do anything.  oh, yeah. watch me.    popbot: too bad that nice junkman couldn't stick around for the treats.  another lunar pie, boys.  lay one on me, mombot.  these are even better than mrs. neutron's lemon cookies.   it's true.  forgive me, judy.  brobot: hey, jimmy.  let's play another game of moon tennis.  aw, but we just played it 12 times.  but it'll be fun.  i'm kind of tired.  please.  one more time. two more times.  three more.  more, more, more....  maybe later.  now. come on.  it'll be fun.  brobot: what do you like better, fun or
