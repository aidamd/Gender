 .  wish you could stay, but i understand.  thanks for coming, bye.  we're not leaving the party.  it finally got good, hmm.  you can't kick me out.  i'm... i'm me.  carl: don't stop me, jimmy.  i've got feet of flames.  oh, what am i going to do.  think, think.   you're a duck all the way.   brain blast.  by speeding up time within the confines of my house using my time accelerator, they can have their party and leave it, too.    girl: what's going on.   cool party, neutron.   for once, you did something right.   it was great, even though i never got a little weenie.  let me know when you're having another party, jimmy.  oh, will do, betty.   ah.  hi, honey.  how was your evening.  oh, fine.  did you throw a wild party.  what.  just kidding.  goddard, activate lightspeed clean up.   looking good.  judy: we certainly have a wonderful sonso responsible and trustworthy.  you couldn't leave most boys his age alone like that.  no, you couldn't.  but then, jimbo's not most boys.  he's one in a million.  he sure is.  say, i'm going to hang up my jacket and then i'm going to say more nice things about jimmy.  uh, sugar booger, how long have we had a raptor in the closet.   judy: james isaac neutron.  jimmy: i can fix that... i hope.  hugh: bad dinosaur, bad.  that's it, out of the house.  ow. ow.  i'm glad you're extinct.  you're mean.  sheen: i'm telling you, bologna is made by tiny bologna elves.  and i'm telling you, bologna grows on mighty bologna trees.  does not.  does, too.   jimmy:  hi, guys.  oh, no.  goddard's eaten jimmy.  jimmy: not quitei'm on the lab speakerphone.  i want you to get your favorite video games and come over.  i've got an invention you'll love, and it...   how'd you get here so quick.  i had a copy ofultra lord versus robofiend mega battle in my pocket.  and you carry that around all the time.  oh, i don't need to.  i can stop whenever i want.  i don't have a problem.  not today, you don't.  how would you, sheen, like to fight side by side with ultra lord, live and in person.   jimmy.  i love you.  behold the glory that is...  the neutronic game pyramid.  ooh, pointy.  it actually deconstructs your particles and inserts you into your favorite video game.  so as soon as carl gets here...  sheen: no, no.  i want to fight side by side with ultra lord now.  every moment i'm not fighting side by side with ultra lord is tearing me apart.  okay, okay, okay.  insert the game, then stand on the transference pad.  oh, one more thing.  this pyramid is only a prototype, so in order to exit the game, you have to win.  so just to be on the safe side, i'll start you out on level 1.  as ultra lord said in episode 62, "love, valor, ultra lord." fractalize me.      awesomei'm actually on the ultra planetoid.  ultra lord: greetings, lifeform.  i'm about to engage robofiend in pitched combat.  would you like to be my battle buddy.  bbbattle buddy. mme.  answer quickly.  my ultra senses tell me that robofiend is approaching.  at last.  my long years of watching tv have paid off.  let evil tremble, for none can withstand the awesome might that is ultra lord and his new battle buddyultra sheen..    okay, that couldhave gone better.  jimmy:oh, sheen.  now he's trapped in there. oh, well...  i'm sure he can't possibly lose twice on level 1.  sheen : hey, look at me.  i'm headgrowingoutoftheground man.  or maybe i'd better give him a hand.   hey, what happened.  i'm free.  that's because i pressed "reset." i couldn't let you get stuck in here.  sorry, jimmy.  seeing ultra lord in all his shining glory distracted me so.  ultra lord: greetings, lifeforms.  i'm about to engage robofiend in pitched combat.  would you like to be my battle buddies.  he always says that.  get ready, jimmy.  robofiend's about to get ultra whipped.  carl: my favorite video game.  oh, no, no, no, it's too much pressure.  ninja llamas in space.no.  llama versus megadingo.  : of course.  llamapalooza.  oh, i love you most of all.    prepare to taste photons, cosmic avengers.  okay, sheen, here's the plan...  jimmy, please.  may i remind you this is level 1.       he's all yours, encased crusader.  hey, robofiend.  hold this for me.    oh, sheen, that was awesome.  the scent of victory is pungent.   : or is that just me.   hey, jimmy, the lab door was open, so i came right in and... oh, wow.  it'srobofiend mega battle featuring jimmy and sheen.  this must be the surprise jimmy had.  hey, jimmy, where are you.  can i play your new game.  i guess he went to the "little inventor's" room.  well, i'm sure he won't mind.  level 1.  come on, that's for babies...  let's try level 7.    but, but, but... i don't get it.  we won the game.  we should have exited already.  greetings, lifeforms.  i'm about to engage robofiend in pitched combat.  would you like to be my battle buddies.  leapin' leptonsthe game has reset itself.  ultra lord: answer quickly.  my ultra senses tell me that robofiend is approaching.  no problemo.  i can kick robofiend's level 1 butt all day long.    : or not.  taste magma, cosmic avengers.    jimmy, something's wrong.  robofiend doesn't get a magma cannon until level 5.  someone must have raised the game level, but who.  both: carl.  jimmy: carl, stopit's not a game.  we're really in danger.  wow, the characters know my name...  talk about interactive.  hmm, i wonder if this game has the robofiend atomic breath feature.      jimmy : atomic breath.  : gross.   ultra lord: behind me, battle buddies.  don't worry, jimmy.  we're okay as long as ultra lord's shields hold.  hmm, those shields look kind of strong.  i'd better drain them.      that's going to leave an ultra bruise.   ultra lord.  no....  oh, yeah, i'm bad.  : i defeated ultra lord..  : and yet... i feel strangely empty inside.  maybe it's because this game doesn't have any llamas.  it's all my fault.  i'm a baaaad battle buddy.  if only we had more power.  you'd have to capture an ultra crystal to get a mega level power boost.  ultra crystalsof course.  okay, sheen, can you distract robofiend for me.  leave it to me, battle buddy.  sheen: hey, roboloser.  is that the rotting carcass of a rigilian mold bat i smell.  or is that just your robofunk.      if i were a game programmer, where would i hide an ultra crystal.      of course.  it's always under the stalagmites.   sheencatch.  i got it, i got it.   fool.  you are helpless before one who now and forever shall be known as...  mega robofiend.  you might think about counseling.  i'm picking up some selfesteem issues and it's...  ah,llamapalooza.    robofiend: now face the fury of my optiblasts.   what the....   sheen, where are we.  ride, carl.  ride like the wind.  there must be another ultra crystal around here someplace.    yes.  sheen.  heads up.    power coursing through my cuticles.  power enough to transform ultra sheen into...  mega ultra sheen.   our power is too evenly matched.  good thing i know your one true weakness.  : no.  yes.  the european director's cut ofultra lord,episode 317 reveals that his archenemy robofiend is...  lactoseintolerant.  taste llama milk, star destroyer.  no, i'm allergic.  don't.    well done, battle buddies.  join me again next time in the neverending battle against evil.     phew.  there's no way i'm ever, ever playing that game again till next week.  well, i guess my prototype needs a little more work.  it's a good thing you came through with those llamas, carl.  you know, we, we... carl.  jimmy, look.  carl: llamapalooza.  llamapalooza, yay.   we've got to get him out right away.  maybe we'll let him stay there till after lunch.  okay. got any bologna.  carl: llamapalooza.   hey.  sioning s ]that's gogurt.  okay, who is shrek's best friend.
