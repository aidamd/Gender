 will you be all right, staying here by yourself tod.  well, i... i guess so.    it doesn't get any better than this.    here's today's homework, jimmy.  gee, you look really sick.  yeah....  you look like you have beriberi fever.  have you been eating any berries that were foaming at the mouth.  : actually, guys...   i'm not sick.  c sick patch.  you're only sick when you wear it.  so your parents let you miss school.  when they're gone, you take it off and...  the party begins.  i want one.  patch me. patch me.  i want cholera.  : step right up, gentlemen.  cindy: hey.  what about us, neutron.  sounds like you finally invented we want patches.  i'd like one to match my eyes.  : okay, but don't tell anybody else.  no school for me.  all: patch. patch. patch.   miss fowl: this is terrible.  teaching is the only thing that keeps me alive.  how do clouds create rain, carl.  : uh, well, when the clouds get very sad, they cry.  : no, carl.  jimmy..  : water vapor condenses on a particle called a condensation nucleus.  gotta blast.  : very good, jimmy.  i miss them all so much...   except sheen.   how's it going, guys.  oh man, this is so sweet.  i love you, jimmy.  it doesn't get any better than...  hugh: hi, jimbo, how you feeling.  you know, you've missed two days of school.  now, i don't want your brain to rot, so guess what.  homeschool you.  but... don't you have to go to work.  nope, i took the whole week off.  what'll we do first.  oh, let's do math.  no, too numbery.  let's start with biology.  all right, now.  the heart goes beat, beat, beat and the, red... gooey stuff goes into the...  you might want to pay attention here you never know when you're going to be quizzed.  relax, cindy, only 678 more needles to go.  : this is the same plastic bubble that my father put me in for 14 happy years.  hey, there, bubble boy.  woman: relax, baby, it's only a little wasp.  your greatgreatgreatgrandmother used wasps to cure everything.  then why don't you dig her up and let it sting her..  : i'm sorry mama.  all rightthe old "pepperupthenose cure".  i love it, bring it on.   hipbone's connected to your... bone next to it    that bone's coecteto the...  what's the bone in your knee.  this one, right here.  : i can't take it anymore.  it's time to get well.  ha. get down.  bend the knee.  bend the knee and touch the sky. ha.   your sick patch dissolved into my skin, nerdtron.  jimmy, my patch pulled a houdini.  cure me or face the consequences.  i don't want to be a bubble boy.  okay, okay, settle down.  i can fix it.  carl, sheen, sneak out and meet me in the youknowwhat.  jimmy: now, the sick patches dissolved into our bloodstream.  we'll be sick forever unless i c extract some mitochondria from the virus and make a vaccine.  to do that, two of us will have to shrink to microbe size and travel inside one of you guys.  i volunteer...  carl to be the person we go inside of.  i second the...  hey, wait a minute.  uh, jimmy, is this legal.  in some states.  depends what you mean by "legal." let's go.   goddard, activate shrink ray and commence shrinkage.  sheen: wow.   we are so small.  jimmy: let us begin our fantastic journey to the center of carl.  carl: um, if you guys find anything neat inside me, would you bring it back so i could see it.   ow.  hey, carl, you need to do some excavating in here.   hey, guys, that tickles.  ah...  carl:.. ah...  carl, do not sneeze.  i repeat: do not sneeze.  sorry.   look, there's carl's brain.  where. i don't see it.  is it behind that walnut on a stick.  um... well... actually...  oh.    i got people inside me    and they're walking in my brain.   hey, jimmy, look.  it's that thing you see in cartoons that people always punch like a punching bag.  i'm going to take a whack at i no, no, no, sheen.  if you touch carl's uvula, he'll throw up.  whew. thanks, jim, i owe you one.  so, where do we go...  now.....   hey, you guys taste pretty good.    we've reached our destination...  the stomach.  sheen: man, carl eats a lot of junk, doesn't he.  hey, carl, you're supposed to play with the toys in the silly meals, not eat 'em.  i know, but they always look so colorful and chewy.  that germ has to be around here somewhere.  be careful of those gas bubbles, sheen, you t want to get trapped in one of...  sheen: hey, get me outta here.  there's a germ.  i have to extract the mitochondria before it gets away.   i have a very bad feeling about this.   germ attack.  i saw that movie.  the special effects were third rate, but the acting was better than expected.  i gave it a thumbsup.  sheen, you have to distract the other germs while i get the mitochondria out.  okay, but i better get some kind of award for this.  hey, germs, over here.  looky, looky.    it's not working.  do something else.  how about some impressions.  anything.  okay.  : i'll be back.  here's johnny.  you dirty rat.  that's all, folks.  i used to dance in my younger days.  then dance.  shake it, sheen, shake it.  but don't break it, sheen. ooh. ooh.  try something else.  what am i, a threering circus..  that's all i got.  wait, i have an idea.  germs are attracted to saline, which exists in tears.  sheen, start crying.  how am i supposed to cry right now.  i don't cry, i'm a man.  pretendultra lord just got canceled.   why is the world so cruel.  i got the mitochondria.  let's blow this pop stand.  sheen: how do we get out of here.  jimmy: through the nearest exit.  uh, do you have a plan "b"erhaps.  well, we could always pull a "pinocchio." we're going to turn into puppets.  cool.  no, but if we had something to make carl sneeze like the whale inpinocchio, we'd get out.  like my dad always says, "when in doubt, break out the pepper." ah... ah...  jimmy: prepare for bodily ejection at hypersneeze speed.  jimmy told me not to sneeze.  must... fight it.  fight it.  ah... ah... losing.    carl: did you guys bring me a souvenir.  now i can cure everybody and we can go back to school.  uh, can i take a shower first.  i can't believe i'm saying this, but i'm glad to be back in school.  i'm never getting sick again.  that wasp sting really hurt.  one little sting.  try 678 needles and then talk to me about pain.  no more leeches, mama.  no more leeches, mama.  no more leeches, mama.  it's so good to have you all back.  now, i'd like you to meet a new student.  please give a nice, warm, friendly welcome to yentl marmelstein.  hi, i...   oh, sorry.  i have a cold.  all: no.  keep her away from us.  unclean. unclean.  sanctuary.  cindy: run for your life.   i think they like you.  newchocolatey puff.  it's more chocolatey.  just how chocolatey is it.  new, coco puffs. explodes with extra chocolate.  i'm cuckoo for cocoa puffs. cuckoo for cocoa puffs.  announcer ]cocoa puffs cereal with new chocolatey explosion puffs, part of a good breakfast.  with campbell's chicken& stars soup, your mouth will blast off.  chickennstars    twinkle, twinkle    campbell'schickennstars    oh, what a rockin'soup you are      worth lickin'the dish for   wow.  campbell's chicken& stars soup.  out of this world.   the great outdoors.  now, this is what it's all about.   fresh air, clean dirt, nothing to depend on but your own sweat and toil.  uh, honey, come on, put your back into it.   okay, dear, all packed.  thanks, sugar booger.  oh, this is going to be the best camping trip ever.  boys, are you ready to move out.  um, jimmy.  not that no tv and ticks in your sleeping bag isn't fun, but... why do we have to go camping with you.  if you don't, i'll be forced to publish these photos of you guys playing with pomona beach debbie dolls.  pomona beach debbie is an action figure.  she possesses supermutant powers which can defeat any adversary...  except for ultra lord.  i like the pretty bathing suits.  what is this. insect repellent.  a compass. toilet paper.  ust weigh us down.  hugh, are you sure you know what you're doing.  of course, i dodon't forget i was an acorn lad.  i remember everything i've ever learned.  like the song that we used to sing.   we are the acorn lads...    something, something, the acorn lads.    come on, goddard.   no, no, no.  no technology at all on this trip.  today we pit our neutron hardihood against the savage wild.  manand boyagainst nature.  come on, boys, sing it with me.   we are acorn lads...    something, something...   byebye.   alone at last.  let's break out the cookie dough and watch gladiator movies.    and forever, we'll be... something.   well, look it.  here we are.  dad, this isn't the campground.  campgrounds are for tenderfoots, jimbo, what with their fancy running water, and first aid kits, and adequate lighting.  oh, no, we're headed deep into the untamed wild.  jimmy.  your dad is beginning to scare me.  don't worry, guys.  i worked all last night on a very special invention.  we won't be roughing it onthiscamping trip.  come on, boys, follow me into this mosquitoinfested bog.       this is the fourth time we've been through this bog.  dad, i think we're lost.   lost, are we.  uh... no.   this is my old secret campsite.  or close enoughit's got trees and rocks.  yeah, you boys set up camp.  i go bring back fire.  see you later, byebye.   when he gets back, carl, hit him over the head with a coconut, and i'll go for his legs.  no need, sheen.  i told you, we're not going to rough it on this trip.  behold the remarkable simplicity that is...  the neutron campinabox.  well, how are we going to fit in there.  it's every convenience you could wish for in a stark wilderness setting.  observe.    wow.  cool.   all right.  good evening, sir.  may i bring you something.  who's that.  oh, that's just rayburn.  he's a holographic butler i programmed into the campsite.  may i suggest for the young masters a '72 purple flurp with a plate of hot wings and a video game.  are these outdoors great, or what.  yeah.  wow.  : i've never felt more at one with nature.  hugh: come on, come on.  spark, will you.  must make fire.  oh, it's no use.  i've tried everything, even this highly combustible dirt.  i just...   ...can't get anything to spark.  maybe my backwoods skills aren't what they used to be, i...   wait a minute.  what's all the hubbub.  hey, jimmy.  if your butler's just a hologram, how come he can make us chocolate sundaes and stuff.  he's composed of specially solidified photons.  you can pick them up at any hardware store.  well, his pork tartar is out of this world.  jimbo.  what have you done.  dad, you're back already.  i, i can explain.  no need, son, i can see for myself.  you did a great job setting up this campsite.  uh... i did.  well, a little flashy, but it looks like you got the old wilderness genes after all.  good evening, sir.  may i bring you something.  jimbo, who's the shimmery guy.  um, gee, uh...  park ranger.  he helped us set up.  i would suggest you not poke me, sir.  you'll disrupt my phasing.  but, what the...  wait a minute.  he's one of your hologrammy thingies, isn't he.  oh... now i get it.  you set all this up using technology.  jimbo, i am very disappointed in you.  but... you said i could set up camp.  a neutron doesn't need fancy gadgets to survive in the wild.  i'm sorry, son, but this stuff is going to have to go.  no, but, dad...  no "buts", young man.  now, how do i turn all this stuff off.  you'd have to remove the power pack, sir.  just under the soda bar.   dad, dad, wait.  the reactor...  of course, removing the power pack while the core is still active will lead to a meltdown in five, four, three...  run.   will you be needing anything else, sir.   our camp, our equipment...  everything's gone.  we're doomed.  all right, calm down.  i know what you're all thinking: "this is jimmy's fault." but don't worry.  i can still use my wilderness skills to get all of us home safely.  but dad, it's almost too dark to see the trail.  a true camper doesn't trust his eyes, jimbo.  he goes by pure animal instinct.  this way, lads.   mmm.  eeny, eeny, miny, mo.  you said "eeny" twice.  oh, it's no use.  we're done for, and it's all my fault.  the truth is, i'm a rotten camper.  there, i said it.  the other acorn lads used to dunk my head in the bug juice.  oh, don't worry, dad.  we'll find a way out of this.  i don't care if you're a mediocre camper, thanks, son, i...  i needed to hear that.  so you couldn't even make a fire.   oh, no, it's starting.  the gnawing hunger.  must resist desire for human flesh.  wait a minute, carl.  that didn't sound like your stomach.     all: bear.             hugh: it's a dead end.  we'll have to make a stand right here, boys.  who knew it would end like this, trapped between these bright yellow rocks and these clear, sparkly ones.  yellow.  why, that's sulfur.  and this is phosphorus.  dad, that's it.  we can still save ourselves by making a fire from the natural elements around us.  yeah, jimmy, i can't, i don't know...   dad, you're the only one who can save us.  we'll distract the bear.  yeah... we will.   come on, come on, come...  oh, no.  get back.  back, back, give way, for i, hugh neutron, have made fire.  dad, you did it.  behold, bear, i am man, the pointy tip of the food chain.  gaze upon my opposable thumbs and tremble.  yeah, they hate it when you mention the thumbs.  yell)    jimmy: goddard.  oh, there you are, boys.  sugar booger.  mom. how did you know to come save us.  goddard detected the high levels of radiation from the explosion.  good thing i implanted a homing chip under your father's skin, or i never would have found you.  oh, yeah, that darn thing still itches me.  sheen: that was the best camping trip ever.  hugh: it's just like i intended.  our little nature experience has brought us all closer together.  yeah, we ought to rough it more often.  your diet flurp, sir.  ah, i love the outdoors.  h
