kids.  i can't wait until career day tomorrow to tell your classmates that i'm a professional ventriloquist.  you're not a professional ventriloquist.  i am now.  say hello to flippy two.  he's just like flippy one except not completely destroyed.  right, flippy.  you said it, hot shot.  are you really bringing that thing to class tomorrow.  sure, i am.  i'm even working on some new material.  so flippy, how you been lately.  not so good.  some bees tried building a nest in me this morning.  you call a beekeeper.  yeah, but i got a buzzy signal.  get it.  buzzysignal.  it's the sound bees make.  oh, gee, look at the time.  uh, yeah, i just remembered i have to be...  someplace other than here.  wait, where are you going.  they're probably off to tell all your friends about tomorrow.  you are going to be so popular.  byebye now.  hi, mom.  hi, jimmy.  i'm making sugar cookies.  monkey shapes for your father and danish physicist niels bohr for you.  that's nice.  is dad really doing his ventriloquist act tomorrow.  oh, i'm afraid that's my fault.  he was getting so obsessed with ducks, i asked him to get a new hobby.  but his jokes are so... well...  oh, jimmy, how bad can they be.  hugh: what else is new, flippy.  flippy: i got arrested for stealing a sheriff's badge.  hugh: why'd they let you go.  flippy: they couldn't pin it on me.  hugh: comedy gold.  that bad.  maybe you could help your father write some new jokes.  mom, i'm a scientist, not a comedian.  hey, wait a minute.  knock, knock.  be right there.  wait, no, that's not it.   hello, neutron residence.  : s,this is poncho's hat repair.  your sombrero, she is ready.  oh, goody, i'll be right over.  honey, i'm off to pick up my sombrero.  didn't even know i owned one.  chip, please, goddard.  what's that thing.  that, my friends, is a funny chip.   jimmy: carl.  it will supercharge the joke receptors of the nearest brain.  i'll implant it in flippy.  as the computer shows, as long as my dad's holding flippy, the chip will stimulate dad's joke receptors.  the resultmy dad is 512% funnier.  cool.   come on, that chip is pretty funny.  and that is how you reattach the coolant manifold of a 12yearold high breeze airconditioning unit.  i thank you.   that's my dad.  thank you, mr. estevez.  our next speaker will be jimmy's father, mr. hugh neutron.  hugh: thank you, thank you, thank you.  it's so great to see all these smiling faces, isn't it, flippy.  flippy: yes, it sure is.  i haven't seen this many teeth since miss fowl came back from the denture depot.   yeah.  huh.   can't you just smell the learning.  wait, that's butch.  dude, do you ever shower.   what else do you like about lindbergh school, flippy.  you can't beat the cafeteria.  the food there is fit for a king.  here, king...  here, king.   oh, king's a dog's name.   hugh: there were so many laughs, sugarbooger.  i didn't even know i knew those jokes.  jimmy, you must have been so proud.  huh.  hugh, i think your new hobby is starting to come between us.  don't be ridiculous.  say good night, flippy.  good night, don't let the termites bite.  come on, dollface, fill it up.  it's coffee. you can buy more.  mom, what's going on.  oh, your father and that dummy.  he hasn't said a word in his own voice all morning.  hey, am i talking too fast for you.  you need a woodtoenglish dictionary.  let's go.  dad.  dad.  he's fine, jimbo.  eat your breakfast.  jimbo.  the chip.  flippy, i know what you're up to.  hey, bad move, kid.  your pops and i share a brain and i could do some serious damage.  up, dummy.  i think your father's finally lost his mind.  no, it's been stolen.  sorry, mom, got to go.  we got here as fast as we could, jimmy.  flippy's using the funny chip to suck out my dad's brain so he can turn real.  it's turning my dad into a zombie.  first your dad's not funny enough, now he's acting like a zombie.  will you never be sasfied.  are you done.  maybe.  um, why can't you just take his chip out.  i have to get him away from my dad first.  while they're in physical contact flippy can do permanent damage.  why didn't you say so.  i can get them apart, no problem.  they're having a lawn sale.  what are they selling.  both: all your stuff.  you're selling neutron's telescope for a quarter.  i'm also heisting his dad's brain, marrying his mom and moving to vegas.  now, do you want it or not.  i'll give you a nickel.  done.  done.  if you want them separated, i'll separate them.  how much for that puppet.  i'm not a puppet.  a few more hours and i'll be real.  come on, how much.  i want a puppet.  i said take a hike.  just let me hold him.  whoa.  for a dinky puppet, that kid's pretty strong.  that does it.  this has gone far enough.  quit stealing my dad's brain.  back off, jimbo, or i'll set the inside of his head on "frapp." jimmy: magnetize.  whoa.  no.  no, jimmy, please.  all i wanted was to be real like you and your friends.  well, notyourfriends, they're morons.  but you don't know what it's like being a dummy: unable to cry or laugh, always wearing tiny, illfitting suits and don't even get me started what i got to put up with to get my mouth to move.  he could warm his hands up once in a while.  please, just let me be real.  i don't think so.  oh, no,  the brain transference is complete.  jimmy.  jimmy, are you okay.  what happened.  he's got my dad.  we can't let him get away.  buckle up for safety.   i see him on your tracking thingy.  they're headed for the woods outside of town.  we've got to catch them.  flippy doesn't need my dad anymore.  probably plans to...    flippy. no.  sorry, kid, the big guy's got to go, or you'll keep trying to get his brain back.  man, that's one smart puppet.  you sure that's your dad's brain.  my dad's brain...  judy: he was getting so obsessed with ducks i asked him to get a new hobby.  obsessed with ducks...  obsessed with ducks.   flippy, lookpiedbilled grebes.  really.  hey, i know what you're trying to pull.  well, it ain't going to work.     look at all the duckies.  wait till i tell sugarbooger.   i got him, jimmy.  i'll open his hatch like a coolant manifold on a 12yearold high breeze.  what.  where am i.  dad, it's jimmy.  are you okay.  feel strange.  my head's all...  hey, look.  duckieslots of them.  oh, i love duckies almost as much as i love pie.  i wish they could make duckshaped pie.  oh, boy, wouldn't that be something.  or how about pieshaped ducksthen you could have dessert and dinner at the same time.  jimmy: and then he threw sheen across the lawn and threatened to set your brain on "frapp." wow. i miss everything.  well, that's enough excitement for me for quite a while.  thank goodness things are back to normal.  you got that right.  : could you please pass the salt.  yeah, well...  it's probably just a residual brain wave.  w $0jh"8rw0jhlp4w0j8rw0jho hp7 0jhop7 0jc 0jc 0jcx 0jh.cxm0jh.
