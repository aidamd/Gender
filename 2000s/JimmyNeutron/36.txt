rock band.  yeah, we don't even play any instruments.  or have any discernible abilities.  guys, guys, guys.  i got it under control.   gentlemen, i present the neutron synchronous mind instruments.  each one has an internal computer that has downloaded every note, every chord every lick, every run, groove rhythm, and beat ever played.  all we have to do is think the sound and the instruments will do the rest.  so, if we think it, we can play it.   oh, baby. i'm playing, i'm playing.   wow. i can do something.  somebody call my mom.  you kids.  good luck tonight, and rememberhave fun with it.  hey, jimmy, we need a name.  how about the mighty disciples of ultra lord.  oh, oh, hey, what about this.  the science kings.  oh, i got a name, and it's great.  does it have the word "llama" in it.  no.  yes.  okay. well, um, maybe we can mix them together.  i knowthe llama lords of science.  all right. yeah, that's cool.  one, two, three, think.     cindy: this can't be happening.  nerdtron actually rocks.   my foot is tapping.  libby. we got to get out of this place.  iii can't fight the music.  snap out of it.  we can't let carl, sheen, and neutron win that trophy.  come on, we've got work to do.   all: i'm going to be the greatest rock star ever.  uh, i'm thinking about changing our name.  what about the jimmy neutron experience.  yeah, i kind of like the carl weezer project.  i have to vote for sheen and the sheenettes.  you guys can be the sheenettes.  or we can get some sheenettes, and you guys just stand behind the curtain and carry my stuff around, and stuff.   so tired...  haven't eaten... or slept.  libby, quit slacking.  you heard neutron and his band of nerds.  we have to be better.  we are the mistresses of dance.  faster, libby, faster.  okay, so, which song are we going to do at the talent show tonight.  i wrote a speed metal rock opera last night.  it's called ultra lord, superstar.  well, see,iwas thinking more along the lines of a fusion of techno alternative ska with some free jazz thrown in you know, to impress the critics.  i wrote a love song.  is it about llamas.  no.  yes.  no love songs.  we've got to kick out the jams, dude.  jimmy, when do i get to play my drum solo.  if carl gets a drum solo, iwant a bass solo.  no, no drum solos and no bass solos.  if anyone has a solo, it's going to be me.  you. who died and made you rock 'n roll king.  i think we should all wear makeup.  no makeup.  guys, guys, what we look like isn't really important.  now, let's practice.  practice. don't tell me what to do, all right.  yeah, neutron, ever since i started this band you've been holding me back.  no, i started this band.  you started this band..  you kidsgood luck tonight and rememberhave fun with it.    ladies and gentlemen welcome to lindbergh elementary's annual talent show.   and now, our first contestant, nick dean.     the boy's one of a kind.  aw, pukin' pluto, where is he.  hey, way to show up five minutes before we go on, sheen.  wawaiwait, excuse me.  from now on, you will refer to me as "the artist formerly known as sheen." mmhmm. no, he never sings backup.  always sings lead.  here, what's this.  i have to share a bloomin' dressing room with you two blokes.  carl, why are you talking like that.  oh, no, no, no, please refer all inquiries to me image consultant.  yes, yes, no, yes.  oh, that's right.  big calendar shoot coming up.  jimmy: your what..  hey, hey, what is this.  i specifically requested dolphinsafe doughnuts.  i refuse to perform until all my ridiculous demands are satisfied.  fine, we don't need you.  right, more time for me drum solo.  what's wrong with his throat.    thank you.  let's see those boneheads beat that.  oh, that was nice but i think jimmy and his friends will be even better.  yeah, they better be.  i paid 125 bucks for these tickets.  hugh, this is a free school function.  duh. darn scalpers.  i want a drum solo. you can't just have everything you want.  i want a behindthescenes documentary tracing my amazing ride to fame, while revealing several humiliating skeletons in my closet.  oh, i can't believe i even let you two in my band.  yourband. yes, my band.  if it wasn't for my instruments you'd be blowing nose bubbles and spitting water.  oh, yeah.. yeah.  well, here's what i think about your stupid instruments.  hey.  you just destroyed my instruments.  who needs your stupid instruments when you've got my musical genius.  oh, you're both a couple of ruddy twits.  that's it.   you kidsgood luck tonight and remember, have fun with it.   wwait a minute.  sheen and carl, what are we doing.  well, i was about to strangle carl.  yeah, and i was going to slap sheen in the back of the head.  look at us.  we're best friends and ever since we started this band we've been arguing and fighting.  we're so obsessed with becoming rock stars that we've forgotten the real reason we did this.  to beat cindy and libby.  : yeah...  llama lords of science...   ...you're on.   we can't go out without our instruments.  they'll laugh at us.  they'll write unkind things about us in our yearbooks.  there's been a slight change.  the llama lords of science will not be performing.   i want my money back.  uh, not that i paid, or anything.  instead, here is jimmy, sheen, and carl doing...   something else.   observe.      audience: ew.  carl: aw, cheer up, guys.  eighth place isn't so bad.  carl, there are only seven acts.  think of it this way, guys.  we may not have won first prize but at least we got our friendship back.  i know one thing.  i'm never playing in a band with you guys ever again.   me neither.  you got that right.   hey, guys, i got a new name for you.  the losers.   you guys walking home or are you taking the snot bubble.  oh, yeah.  well, you just wait till next year, vortex.  the llama lords of science are going to reunite.  yeah, and i'll do my drum solo.  no drum solos.  right, no drum solos.  but a bass solo from the artist formerly known as sheen.  no, none of that either.  i want a drum solo.  captioning sponsored by theu.s.u.  h c(]  with superpowered mind, a mechanical canine     he rescues the day from

participate in tomorrow's parentchild picnic games, cindy and her mom will once again smear the competition.  come anyway to watch neutron and his klutzy dad.   vortex, you know darn well we won a medal last year.  yeah, for funniest collision.  ooh...  miss fowl: class, please, it's not polite to...   that collision was hilarious.  it was great.   what am i going to do.  my dad's all thumbs and has two left feet.  cool. if your mom grows a beard, we can start our own circus.  me and my dad just want to go the distance without breaking anything, or twisting anything or pulling something or dislocating...  okay... we get it.  well, it's only a game, right.  and who knows.  maybe my dad will surprise me this year.  hugh: hey, boys.  just going to the garage to get... whoa.  does your mom got game.  jimmy: mom, could you please pass the pork loaf.  certainly, dear.  wow.  nice pass, mom.  ever consider competing at the amateur school picnic level.  well, i...  hugh: that reminds me, jimbo...  aren't the parentchild picnic games this saturday.  i've been looking forward to it all year long.  hey, watch me shotput this potato.  oh. oh. ohh....  hugh.  be careful.   man: ow. my eye.  oh, if dad competes, we lose for sure.  goddardoptions.  no... too mature.  i'm no quitter.  hmm... cheating would be dishonest, but i'm far too blinded by my desire to destroy cindy to care.  to the lab.  all right, just one more...  vox, display digital simulation of dad running.  there.  now introduce corrective electromagnetic cranial strip.  you're going down, vortex.  ah, isn't this great, jimbo.  you and me working together as a team.  now, remember, sonthere's no "i" in "team." should we sublimate our individuality for the good of our combined effort.  no, i mean there's no letter "i" in the word "team." there's never a wrong time for a spelling lesson, son.  you know, dad, i know how important professional gear is to an athlete such as yourself, so...  oh, look.  a sweatband.  thanks, jimmy.  you know, once i get going, i sweat like a dock worker on the noon shift.    um, dad, shouldn't we stretch or something.  uh, sorry, carl.  can't risk it.  might dislocate a valve.  remember what happened last year.  oh, yeah.  that nurse was nice.  uh, coach grubber, my dad's out of town, so i brought max.  he collects cans outside my dad's office.  grubber: no problem.  that in the event of an absent parent, a vagrant may be substituted.  so, where's the free grub.  right this way, vagrant.  i can't wait to see the look on neutron's face when we whip his butt.  how about that klutzy dais.  that man is engaged in a lifelong battle with gravity.  may we have our ham back.  teams, take the field for the marshmallow toss.  parents will stand behind the line.  kids will fire marshmallows into their pie holes.  on your mark, get set...  i didn't say go.  hurl.   dag nabbit, carl, throw one.  ow, i'm hit.  am i bleeding.  incoming.  grubber: timefall in for a count.  what's the deal, neutron.  last year, your dad couldn't walk a straight line, and now he's like something out of a fancy french circus.  je ne sais pas, mademoiselle.  with a record 37 marshmallows, team neutron wins the first event.  yes, indeedy dandy.  i'm on fire.   i'm watching you, neutron.  grubber: fall in for the piggyback teacher hurdles.  parents must vault over teachers while lugging their offspring on their backs.  ready, set...  i did not say "go." i said, "set." ready, set, not go.  not gogo.   don't hurt mama.  oh, dear, you're wearing cleats.  ow.  behind you.  coming up.  and dig it.  we have a winner.   team neutron is dominating these games.  who's hot.  we're hot.  who's not.  they're not.  this can't be happening.  cindy: hey, that's weird.  headbands don't usually give off electrostatic discharge.  mr. n., may i offer you a congratulatory purple flurp.  why, thank you, cindy.  my insides could use a hosedown.  dad... no.  oh, no.  oh, yes.  say goodbye to your medal, neutron.  aren't you forgetting.  there's only one race left, and we already have two wins.  aren't you forgetting that the last event is worth 90% of your score.  ... boy, that was refreshing.  i feel like doing a onehanded double back flip.  i think i will.  dad, wait.  about your headband, well...  see, i electronically enhanced it to make you better, because i wanted to win.  well, i'm sorry to hear that, son.  you know, i thought i'd taught you that winning isn't important.  what's important is the healthy fellowship of sport.  i'm sorry, dad.  i guess my need to win got the better of me.   smell that, cindy.  that's the stench of loserdom.  oh, yeah.  bring it on.  when we're done with you, you'll be sucking loser soup through a straw.  but dad, what happened to the fellowship of sport.  sport, shmort.  losing blows eggwater.  now, let's kick some vortex hiney.  grubber: take your marks for the blindfolded chariot race.  get set...   and...   i didn't say go.  i didn't say go.  not yet, not yet, not yet.   to the left.  dad, to the left.  cone at 2:00.  execute left turn now.  okay, a little to the right.  no, look...  almost.  no... stop.   onward to victory.  dad, lemonade stand.  dad, stop.  oh, for pete's sake.   did we win.   no, but i don't think we're finished just yet.  and for the third year in a row, the winner of the picnic games is team vortex. )
