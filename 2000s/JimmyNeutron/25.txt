 you can't go around correcting people.  yeah. although i do love what you've done with this blouse.  humans are supposed to be flawed.  their flaws mean that they're functioning perfectly.  get ready, guys.  faced with this paradox, the saucer module will explode, just like last time.  humans are flawed, but their flaws mean that they're... perfect.  but if they're perfect, they can't be flawed.  it's quite the conundrum.  my brain hurts.  i call an errorextreme error.  we are programmed to delete extreme error, but this module has no delete function.  it's got a molecular atomizer.  close enough.  nanobots, for the last time, execute your programming.  nanobot one: we obey, o creator.  both: delete, delete.    nanobots: delete, delete, delete, delete, delete, delete, delete, delete, delete, delete.  delete, delete, delete, delete, delete, delete, delete...  carl, sheen, take cover.      aah. aah.     gotcha.  nanobots, do not delete.  do not delete.  he doesn't want to be deleted.  but he's a flawed human.  to obey him would be error.  this is making my circuits spin.  what if we delete everyone else first.  sweet. then the creator will have a chance to admire our work.  yes.thenwe delete him.  works for me.  nanobot two: storing creator until final deletion.  nanobots.  wait. don't.  nanobots, open the door.  there, that's everyone.  negative. this unit detects further human error.   now can we delete the creator.  not yet.  sensors indicate this entire planet is infested with extreme human error.  you mean....  mmhmm.  we must delete every human on earth.  let's start with the french.  i found principal willoughby's keys.  hurry, carl.  jimmy has only seconds of air left.  jimmy: sheen, i've got plenty of air.  just open the door.   thanks, guys.  easy, jimmy.  take slow, deep breaths.  carl, are we the only ones left.  the ole school's empty.  the nanobots have deleted the entire town.  we've got to get to the lab.  hugh: be right back, little surf scooter.  you just stay.  stay. good boy.   butter biscuit, are we all out of the wood finish.  got to wipe down the bluewinged ruddy duck.  pine nut pants.   hello.   she must still be out shopping.  wheezer always keeps a spare can of wood finish in his crawl space.  howdy, neighbors.  your front door was open.  hello.  wheezer...  : wheezer.  wheezer.  where is everybody.  anybody.  anybody at all.   hello.  not a soul on the entire block.  maybe they got together and formed an angry mob.  wait up, everybody.  i want to be in the mob, too.  sam.  anyone.  somebody answer me.   i'm alone.  i don't know how or why, but i am the last man on earth.  judy... jimmy... they're...  they're gone.  how will i live.  how will i deal with the crushing loneliness.   whoo, i feel so light and airy.  whoohoohoohoo.   hugh: whoohoo.  wow.  now, that is hugh time.  carl: everyone in the world, gone.  it's horrible.  i know.  oleander owed me 53 cents.  they're not really gone, guys.  they've been dumped into a virtual trash bin.  i knew it.  what's a virtual trash bin.  it's a trash file for deleted items, like on any computer.  oh.  jimmy: when the nanobots delete someone, they're converting them into electrons.  i see. go on.  the electrons get downloaded onto the hard drive, which stores them in the trash file.  and...  but if the trash bin gets full, the nanobots will have to dump it, and if that happens, everyone's atoms will be gone forever.   nanobot two: adieu, adieu, adieu to you and you and you.  nanobot one: on to belgium.   must... enjoy... hugh time.    well, that's it.  i've done just about everything i can think of.  i still miss my family.  oh... who am i kidding.  what good's personal time if there's no one to share it with.  without judy and jimbo, there's no reason for me to live.  no reason at all.     aunt mo's pies.  no... no, they could never replace the ones i love.  but, hey, look at all the pie.  yes.  i will do it.  i... will... live.  if i can't capture them in this magnetic field, we're done for.  carl, any sign of the nanobots on the monitor.  no, uhuh, jim.  : sheen, we need that monitor to watch for the nanobots.  okay, okay.  just let me destroy this star cruiser.   who is it.  nanobot one: uh... telegram.  yeah, like i'd really fall for that old trick.  nanobot two: llamagram.  llamagram.  ooh. ooh. ooh.  okay.  jimmy, jimmy.  i just beat my high score on "alienator." oh, and the nanobots are here.  leaping leptons.  quick, goddard, flycycle mode.   nanobot two: stop, we wish to please you.  nanobot one: that is why we must delete you.  november, december, the next year, the next year after thatan endless supply of pie.  mmm... boysenberrythe most delicious part of my postapocalyptic nightmare.   hey, it's dad.  he hasn't been deleted yet.  endless pie.  : endless pie.  whoa....  nanobot one: creator, prepare to be deleted.  and pleased.   nanobot two: the computer's trash bin is full.  ooh, we have been deleting a lot lately.  prepare to empty trash bin.  i can't let them dump everyone's electrons.  think... think...  hugh: endless pie...  endless pie...  brain blast.  nanobots, wait.  nice job, guys.  excellent work.  i'm ready to be deleted.  but before you do, i have one last request.  of course, great creator.  we exist to serve.  we live to please.  kissup.  state your request, mighty creator.  can you guys check my homework one last time.  i think i've got this poem nailed.  just let me make a few changes.  here, here and there.  nanobot one: "cindy sings the body electric, but she's still not as smart as me." nanobot two: "she can't even compute the value of pi, which i know equals three." aha.  error.  pi is not equal to three.  computing.  the correct value of pi is 3.14.  .." overload. overload.  infinite decimal sequence.  .."     my pie.  oh, it's not fair.  i had time.  i finally had all the time in the world.  gee.  sweetie.  honey bunny.  jimjammy.  you're back.  i'm not the last man on earth anymore.  james isaac neutron, what's been going on around here.  uh... nothing.  so, dad, how was your hugh time.  i... it was good, son, but nowhere near as good as "us" time.  aw...  why can't we get along like that.  are you afraid to love.  oh, look.  i found an error with your head unit.  correcting.  no fairyou've got arms.  nanobot one: why do i listen to you.  ow. you know i bruise easily.  chips for brains.  i'm telling motherboard.  haha. missed me.  captioning sponsored by the u.s. department of educationhxzhpgx/pjhnhvp>hphnz bhphptxm6hptxdp>hpexm 8 it works. it's a half day miracle.  yeah. i'm gonna go upstairs now.  hey, you guys aren't going to believe this.  mom and dad think it'shappy half day, timmy.  we overheard you downstairs.  so how do we celebrate. how. how. how.  well, according to mom and dad, you sort of invent half something.  done. i call it the wando machine.  just thrown in one naggy spouse, ..   voila. i'm half idiot and half nag.  you should clean this room.  my elbows are chapped. do i look fat.  and i'm half superior female and halfwitted.  oh, a frying pan.  ..oh...   hey, maybe i should invent something that can make me halfboy and have cool stuff, too.  or you could play with all the other stuff you wished up but haven't touched.  like this rocket kit, drum set, pogo stick, skate board, lasagna, which has gone way bad, this mobile for poofs, and hank, the super home security guard rhino.  my horn of protection is always here for you, timmy.  yeah, thanks, hank. here.  do you have any cheese.  i'm still here for you, timmy.  and i do so play with this stuff.    now, i wish i had my own half day transformation station.  ..  cool.  ah ha.   voila. i'm skate boy.  i wish i had a half pipe.  yahoo.  half day rocks.  hmm. half boy, half skateboard.  clearly the work of fairy godparents.  and with turnaround enjoying his magic, it's the perfect time to capture his fairies.  and my crocker hook will allow me to go in quietly and undetected.  ah.   now to search for the fairies with my magic detector.  oops, had it set for cheese.  but yum, solidified animal mucus.  don't care for the chips, though.  watching the carbs.   )
