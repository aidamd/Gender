 jimmy: gentlemenand annoying female interloperby the end of this journey, we'll all be rich.  this is awesome, jimmy.  i've never been in a submarine before.  hey, jimmy, i found a cool video game starring a thin, green guy and his friend, mr. bleep bleep.  that's the radar, carl.  oh. well, my mom doesn't let us have radar.   if you three sea slugs are done fooling around maybe we can get down to work.  now, after researching the last known coordinates of theoozy scab,and accounting for 200 years of ocean drift i've been able to map out the wreck's probable location.  maps are old school.  i've invented something that'll make finding theoozy scaba nobrainer.  oh, yeah, here we go.  time to complicate a perfectly good plan with one of your goofy, unnecessary inventions.  you're just jealous 'cause jimmy's a genius.  go ahead, captain jimmy.  tell us about your goofy, unnecessary invention.  i give you the gill gab 9000the world's first fish translating device.  we just speak into the microphone and our words are translated into fish sonar allowing us to interview the fish and askthem where the treasure is.  and you wanted to use a map.  well, that is the lamest thing i've ever heard.  what dunderhead would want to talk to a bunch of stupid fish.  i want to talk to fish. i want to talk to fish.  give me that.  hi.  do you like fish snack 'ems.  they're made from fish like you only cut up into little, bitesize pieces and deep fried in burning oil.   carl, you're supposed to ask about the treasure.  hey, you smelling pile of scales.  i knowyouknow where theoozy scabis so start singing before i go barracuda on you.  uh, maybei'lljust ask the questions, huh.  so, i says to him...  you want to know what i says to him.  yeah, okay.  i says, "what's this blonde scale doing on your dorsal fin." wha.... uhhuh.  "have you been seeing that angel fish again."  and you know what he says.  i don't know what he says.  okay, okay. thanks a lot. bye.  got to go.  well,shewas a gold mine of information.  ready to admit your invention's a flop yet, neutron.  yeah, maybe cindy's right, jimmy.  we've been interviewing fish for hours.  and we'llkeepinterviewing them until i say so.  miss fowl maybe have made cindy my lab partner but it's still my ship.  you just can't deal with the fact that my plan's better than yours.  is not. is so.  is not. is so.  is not. is so.  stop it. stop it.  can't you see your constant fighting is tearing us all apart..    that was cool, carl.  i really believed you for a second.  : thanks.  i saw that on a soap opera once.   i'm tired, jimmy.  i want to go home.  you've been talking to fish all night.  do you even know where we are.  don't worry.  i made an automatic pilot system out of my mom's microwave.  it's been piloting the sub for hours.   whoops.  wrong setting.  well, we couldn't have drifted too far.  hmm.  anyone familiar with the sea of japan.  great.  nice going, neutron.  not onlyhaven't we found the treasure but now we'recompletelylost.  lost.. we can't be lost.  we only brought enough food for two days.  and i'm not eating carl.  well, i'm not eating you, either.  okay. maybe a bite.  no one's eating anybody.  just give me time to come up with a plan.  too late. you had your chance.  now, stand down.  what.  youcan't take overmysub.  oh, no.  miss fowl made us lab partners.  that makes me cocaptain.  according to the big book of submarines that gives me the right to relieve you of duty.  throw him in the brig.  it'll take a lot more than ravenous hunger to turn my men against me.  show her, boys.  sheen: i'll get some rope.  i'll hold him down.  hey, hey, you can't do this.  this is mutiny.  turn this tub around, boys.  we've got anoozy scabto find.  carl: mr. bleep bleep says large object at 2:00.  sheen: hey, cool.  it's theoozy scab.  yes.  did you hear that, neutron.  beginner's luck.  i'm taking her in close.  steady, steady.    sea monster.  no, it's not.  it's a giant squid.  oh.  all: giant squid.   what should we do, jimmy.  how do i know.  you're the captain.  but i don't want to be captain anymore.  yoube captain.  fine. first admit that i'm a smarter, nicer allaround better person than you.  forget it.  attention, giant squid.  we mean you no harm.  it's all jimmy's fault.   it's not working, cindy.  uh, can't we just let jimmy out.  but... i...  oh, all right.  say the magic words.  jimmy neutron is a smarter, nicer allaround better person than i am.   now that wasn't so hard, was it.  hurry, jimmy.  do something.  hmm, the gill gab seems functional.  why isn't it working.  whoa. hurry, jimmy.  quick, carl, throw me your bag of fish snack 'ems.  just as i thought.  freezedried squid.  aha.  i don't get it.  don't you see.  the squid can't understand us because the gill gab only works on fish.  but if i put squid dna from carl's snack on the gill gab's microchip maybe we can communicate with him.  aha.  i don't get it.  jimmy: attention, squid, we come in peace.  : i say, who said that.  we mean no harm.  we just came for the treasure chest inside the boat.  that piece of rubbish.  why didn't you say so.  and to think i was about to crush your heads and suck out your guts.   oh, dear.  there you are.  both: you did it, jimmy.  and don't worry.  despite your mutinous behavior you'll all still get a cut of the treasure.  miss fowl: this is the most delicious salt water taffy i've ever tasted, children.  your project gets an "aplus".   you know, jimmy, i hear each one of these pieces of taffy is worth over three cents.  i don't want to talk about it.  .  the right onefor every one awaits.  .  you just need to knowwhere to look.  the gifts, the styles,the surprises.  save now. feel good. payless.  jimmy: now, carl. now.  oh, why doesn't he push the button.  hey, jimmy.  i was having an argument with my stupid little sister.  is the potty fairy real.  the potty fairy.   of course not.  then who have i been aiming at all these years.  i'll ask carl.  he's more worldly.    carl, what happened.  you were supposed to deploy the antigravity parachute at 5,000 feet.  uh, sorry there, jimmy.  i guess i fell asleep again.  well, your lack of focus is interfering with science.   honey...  i'm going to the supermarket and your dad's coming along to eat the loose grapes from the spill gutter around the produce bin.  eat grapygrape grapes.  got to get them before they turn into raisins because after that...  that's it. food.  you just haven't catalyzed enough hydrocarbons into c02, water and energy this morning.  huh.  you're hungry.   sheen: hey, jimmy, you were right about the potty fairy.  but surely you must believe in the garbage disposal bunny. no.  carl, i have a few more experiments you're going to have to be wide awake for so eat the rest of...  carl.  you obviously need more food.  well, till your parents get back all you've got is lima beans.  : i hate lima beans.  and i'm not hungry, jimmy.  i'm tired, 'cause of...  the nightmare.   it's awful.  a horrible, spooky thing's chasing me.  and i run and i run, but i can't get away.  you should do what i do during a nightmare.  simply prove, on paperusing noneuclidean geometrythat the feared object is a logical impossibility and it vanishes.  yeah, but my dreams aren't as logical as yours, jimmy.  i married a turkey once.  plus, when i'm asleep you're not there to explain things.  true.  wait, just a neutronic minute.  thanks to my most recent invention, i can be.   i call it the dream injector 5,000.  it's revolutionary.  and it's safe.  : are you sure.  carl, i'm going to project your dream into thesomnusportal then walk through and up this tube and into your nightmare.  is it going to hurt.  no, huhuh.  i'll be fine.  now, uh, go to sleep.  well, i can't just go to sleep.  why not.  um, 'cause i have a soothing routine.  first, my mom turns down the light.  vox, lights.  then... ... she makes me hot milk.  oh, for crying in mud.  goddard.  anything else.  both:  nony, nony, nony.     carl oh, no.  i'm in my underwear at the mall.  jimmy: he's asleep.  if i'm not out of his dream in an hour wake him up.  rodgerdodger.    nony, non...   : good night, moon.   it works.  i'm inside carl's dream.  libby: sorry i'm late.  my paddle broke, so i had to row my desk to school with this plastic leg.  quiet.  the great, merciful and powerfullychinned carl is about to speak... ... speak.  thank you, winifred.  this is my revolutionary voltage pandolizer.  i converted the hoskibobits to the flutch by putting it through the hoobaboobler.  ooh, wow. ooh... wow.  when carl's asleep he dreams he's a genius, like me.  like you.. please.  you can't even spell your own name.  now, i'll need a dumb, but willing, volunteer.  but i'm not dumb.  i'm a genius.   : if you're so smart what's the square root of a flexnard, huh.  well, that doesn't make any sense.  the square root of a flexnard is a cup full of boogers.  he did that all in his head.  come on, carl.  we don't have time for this.  we've got work to do.   i will now turn on the really smart experiment machine.  you wired that coil wrong.  all this will do is give me 10,000 volts whichsince this is a dreami won't actually...   kids: ooh...  oh, no.  whatever carl dreams actually happens to me.  sheen. sheen.  wake him up.   jimmy: sheen.  sheen.  okay, enough.  carl, you're asleep.  this is a dream.  : don't be silly.  if it was a dream, could i do this.  that's the only time youcando it.  carl... you're asleep.  there are llamas in the classroom.  libby rode to school with a plastic leg.  her paddle broke.  we don't have time for this.   hehe touched his astounded carlness.  send him to the ultra principal.    what are you doing.   for behold i am the ultra principal.  no, you're not.  you're a friend of mine inside a dream another friend of mine's having.  hah. and again, hah.  if i was a mere dream, could i do this.  that's carl's brain.  is not.  : i am the brain of the ultra principal dispenser of justice throughout the universe.  okay. what am i here for.  you've insulted carl the smartest and handsomest student in all the land.  i sentence you to be his monkey boy for a mmillion years.  with the duty of testing his inventions and fashioning festive doily hats for him to wear.  i'm not going to agree to that.  you already signed your nameincorrectly, by the wayon this binding monkey boy contract.  hah. that's not my signature.  huh.   they're free gutter grapes that would only spoil otherwise your magnificent geniousness.   hey, mom and dad, look.  it's my personal monkey boy.  hey, ththose aren't your parents.  they're mine.   don't be silly, young man.  i would never have a child as dimwitted as you.  plus, if it was a dream, could i do this.   ew, hugh, you're brain's all wet and stretchy.  : that's my tongue.  let go. i've got to taste pie with that.   carl, listen to me.  i'm only here to help you vanquish the horrible spooky thing.    who told monkey boy about the spspspooky thing.   this is hopeless.  wait a minute.  if he won't listen to real logic maybe i should try dream logic.  worth a try.  you told me about the spooky thing oh, brilliant, handsome carl while you were apeddling a bike with no wheels backwards, up the pyramids, um, in a ballerina's tutu.  oh, yeah.  i remember that.  butbut evenyouprobably aren't smart enough to know where it lives.  oh, no.  for your information, it's...  : under there.  that's what you're scared of.   a stupid lima bean.  i know you hate 'em, carl, but they're not scary.      look, carl, wake up.  that thing can really eat me.  i'm not asleep.  yes, you are.  and we're going to prove it mathematically using the riemann hypothesis.  : write this down.  all of nontrivial zeroes of the zeta function have real part equal to onehalf...  okay, but my pen just turned into a worm.    oh, hi, honey.  i brought you dinner.    genius won't help me here.  i need to show carl something so outrageous he'll realize the only explanation is he's asleep.  but what..  ii washed your brain.  but i had trouble getting the think stains out.  that's it.  jimmy kissing cindy.  oh, that couldn't happen in a million years. )
