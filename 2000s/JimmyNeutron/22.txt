 sheen: come on, jimmy.  we can't be late for libby's birthday party.  she asked graystar to play, and if i eat soon, my cakeandicecream sugar rush will coincide perfectly with their first song.  yeah, and i need to stake out a chair near the punch bowl in case this year i want punch.  jimmy: cake and punch, while essential for human life, aren't nearly as exciting as this.  it's nice, jimmy, but i think someone already invented the arch.  this is not your average arch.  behold.  sheen: wow...  that looks like the future.  jimmy: 15 years into retroville's future, to be exact.  those jumpsuits are so slimming.  jimmy: may i present the chronoarch, a portal through timeand this is just a general picture.  using dna tracking, i was able to locate all three of our future selves.  first... the future sheen.   jimmy: apparently you're a top male model.  it's frontpage news every time you change your socks.  i can't believe iti change my socks.  now, the future carl.  man: carl, the llamas you breed can survive underwater, build homes for the needy and filter out unwanted phone calls.  what's next for carl.  well, david, i think you'll be surprised and delighted by carl's latest advances.  i know i was.  jimmy: and now, yours truly.  and as the first scientist to receive the nobel prize in bulk, i would like to ask, "can somebody help me to my car with these."  man :"  wow.  the future used to fill me with fear and dread, but now i can't wait for it.  we don't have to.  that was just view mode.  in travel mode, we can step through the chronoarch and go to the future right now.  i'm sure the future me has one and can send us back safely.  but libby's expecting us at her birthday party.  sheen, it's atimemachinewe'll go to the future and return when the party's getting good.  ow.  careful, guys.  i've been experimenting with my new chemical, megalomanium.  it makes anything it touches mad with power.  ow.  come on, let's go.  well, can we drop our presents at libby's first.  i took a wrapping class at the learning hut, and i don't want my work to go to waste.  i'll get the hover car.  can you wrap mine, too.  it's the essence of lavender overhere sure... ow.  ow.  ow.  flower, cut. cut it out.  i'll cover you, carl.  grab the bottle and let's go.  ow.  ha.  you want a piece of me.  sheen: you want a piece...   i got it.  ow.   ow.  let me out of here.   all: happy birthday, libby.  hey, guys.  ohyou brought me presents.  oh, yeah, the future.  forgot.  okay, gentlemen, the chronoarch is set for 15 years in the future.  our arrival point: downtown retroville.  this is en more awesome than the party, which is going to be awesome.  one... two... three...  go.   jimmy, i think the future's broken.  iii don't understand.  yeah, i thought everything would be cool and futuristical, and we were all famous.  hey, it looks like i'm famous.  jimmy: i wonder why you're on a poster.    voice: what are you doing on the streets.  don't you know dance gazebois on.  dance gazebo.  dance gazebo.  it's required viewing by all subjects of retroville.  along withdance airport, dance grocery store anddance dance hall.  oh, yeah.  uh,dance dance hall... it's, uh, my favorite...  that was a test.  there is nodance dance hall.  that's ridiculous.  i must report your crime to her most terrible dictatorship, so that she may pass an incredibly fair, yet monstrously brutal judgment.  jimmy: libby.  libby's the future dictator of retroville.  check her out.  most people couldn't pull off the futuredictator look.  sheen, we have a situation here.  don't worry, jimmy, she's my main chica.  she'll totally go easy on us.  your dictatorship, these youths stand accused of failure to watch required programming.  what is their sentence.  100 years of hard labor.  how's that, uh, "she'll go easy on us" plan coming along.  i love it when she uses her tough voice.   : oh, no, you split up.  however will i catch you all.  my mom says we should trust policemen.  did she specifically mention giant, fourarmed, robot policemen.  no.  then keep running.  goddard.  escape plan 321.4a.   bank around for carl and sheen.  resisting arrest, eh.  you're only making it worse for yourself.  what could be worse than 100 years of hard labor.  100 years of hard labor in old pudding.  eww.  goddard, we need thrust.   good boy, goddard.  oh, sure.  if i'd have done it, you'd have yelled at me.  and what could possibly have happened to change the outcome of the future we saw earlier.  what did we do before we left.  well, i woke up with a hollow feeling, which went away after i ate plenty of bacon.  uh, closer to our departure, carl.  i'll play back this morning's lab footage.  carl: ow.  ow.  flower, cut. cut it out.  ow.  if you'd have been there, itquite so unmanly.  jimmy: oh, no.  carl, you grabbed the megalomanium.  i was under fire.  it was chaos.  yeah.  jimmy: the stuff that made the flower power crazy.  libby must have opened it at her party, and that's how she became an evil dictator.  we've got to get back to the past uh, how will we get back if we don't have an arch thingy.  simple: we just visit the smartest guy in town.   wow.  good to see the old clubhouse.  i wonder if the gum i buried is still here.  hey, what do you know.   mmm, fruity.  if your gum is here, then my chronoarch is bound to be around somewhere.  hey, the dna scanner's gone.  well, maybe this is a fingerprint analyzer.   wow, it has a pretty tone, almost like a doorbell.  hi.  um, are you jimmy neutron.  : well, lookie heremeet carl and sheen from back in the day.  come on in, you're just in time fordance gazebo.  sheen : i hate what he's done with the place.  oh, can i offer you boys a purple flurp.  i just bought two new glasses, so now i have...  let's see, carry the one...  three.  um, future me, i don't mean to be rude, but it's kind of important that you take us down to my...  your lab.  oh, the lab.  oh. well, uh...  actually, funny story about the lab.  cindy: nerdtron.  nerdtron, what are you doing.  you're supposed to be soaking my mother's feet, and if it's not done every hour on the hour, she experiences severe flaking.  cindy, can you not call me nerdtron...  now that we're married.  : married.  married.  no.  ..  to the toothpick factory.   ..  a danimals vip field trip.   one lucky winner and their classmates ..  come on.  including free rides, look inside any specially marked danimalsto see if you won or with yourparent's permission go to danimals.comfor free means of entry.  many will enter,one will win.  .  danimalicious.  .  ] coming.  for honey nut cheerios.   gasp. and there goes the honey.  not if i can help it.  who'd steal the honey express.  handsome hector...  i love this honey.  well here, have some.  ooh. yummy yummy yummy.  oh no.   you saved the delicious honey.   for honey nut cheerios cereal.  part of this good breakfast.  cheerios for a lightly frosted, sweet, and crunchy taste.    wow, you just screamed for four minutes, jim.  i'm both impressed anddisturbed.  as i was saying, i had to gut the lab so cindy's mom could move in.  her feet require constant care.  you could not imagine that a person's foot could be so...  okay, i get.  what about the chronoarch.  the chronoarch.  gosh, i think i lent it to sheen a while back.  well, we need to find it.  we're being chased by a maniacal police robot.  he could show up at any minute.   boy, it's amazing what grocery stores will just throw out.  look at all this monthold cabbage.  i'm even more incredible than i dared to dream.  uh, future me.  i am you from 15 years in the past and i would like to say it's an honor to...  whoa, dude, you stink.  duh.  that's because i'm a professional dumpster diver.  i scale the insides of trash bins and pluck the jewels within.  cool.  jimmy, this future is fine with me.  well, not me.  future sheen, what did you do with the chronoarch.  ow.  hmm...  did i set it on fire and push it off a cliff, laughing insanely.  i did that to something.  no.  now we're trapped in this horrible time forever, and i don't even have a toothbrush.  oh, wait, yes, i do.  false alarm.  in the meantime, i'll wake carl, then whip those cabbages into a slaw you'll never forget no matter how hard you try.  jimmy: the chronoarch.  future jimmy: oh, i remember.  sheen gave it to carl to sleep on.  he's got problems with his back.  and front.  and sides.  hmm.  did i miss the slaw.  tell me i didn't miss the slaw.  hey.  someone gutted the fuse box and filled it with old cabbage.  that's right.  i pushed the refrigerator off the cliff so i had to store the cabbage in there.  future me, we have to get this operational before the police robot finds us.  the copbot..  but i'm a wanted man.  come on, carl.  we'll stand guard outside.  if you hear us screaming and begging for our lives, that means he's coming.  i'd love to help you fix it, but cindy's mother's feet require constant maintenance.  that's okay.  sheen and carl can take care of that, right, guys.  future jimmy: i'll give it a try.  hey, i know.  let's scavenge parts from goddard.  you still have goddard.  of course i do.  goddard, come here, boy.    goddard has lots of pieces that don't work now.  we can use those.  then let's get started.  think you can get away, eh.  once he's started tracking, a copbot never loses the trail.  uh...     yeah, i remember the first time i saw mrs.  v's feet.  me of the future, why are you a wanted criminal.  for crimes of fashion.  dictator libby tells everyone how to dress, but i cannot wear those shiny fabrics.  they make me chafe.  they don't breathe is the problem.  yes.  finally, someone who understands.  come here, i'm not afraid to hug me.   that's the last of the cabbage.  i've rewired the temporal circuits and patched the quantum fuses with the time breakers.  when i throw this switch, it should work.   jimmy: oh, no.  its internal power source is dead.  what should we do.  gosh, it's been a while since i fiddled with this kind of stuff.  okay, let's see, uh...  well, that's all i got.  future me, what happened to you..  has living in a dictatorship and being married to cindy made you forget your love of science.  you're rightscience used to mean everything to me.  okay, i'll try.  okay, think... think... think...  brain bomb.  uh, you mean "brain blast." uh, right, right.  cindy's mother has a 2,000decibel foot massager in the basement.  if we can tap into its battery, it might be enough to power the chronoarch.  way to go, neutron.  future sheen: hey.  someone took my gum.   this is going to be big.  i might even get upgraded to lieutenantbot.  i wonder how long the memory of this will haunt me.  no.   this was a terrific idea.  thinking it up felt good.  thanks, young me.  you made me realize that my life is truly awful.  psych.    jimmy, what's wrong with sheen.  i don't know.  his iq should have stopped increasing hours ago.  i'd better get to the lab.  miss fowl, will you not let me not leave the classroom.  no.  yes.  thank you.  oh.  : jimmy and sheen need me.  i can't let them down.  miss fowl, can i never ever not be disexcused sometimes.  plant it.  okay.  done.  carlcarl, can you read me.  jimmy, sheen's at the candy bar.  but you'd better hurry.  things are getting ugly.  i said, give me my free sundae.  and i said there's no way you could've known there were 12,082 beans in that jar without cheating.  i told you, i used a complex algorithm, based on the dimensions of the jar.  yesterday you thought seashells were money.  today you're using algorithms.  yesterday i wasn't a genius.  now, give me my ice cream, monkey boy.  i heard that, carl.  i didn't say anything.  i heard your thoughts.  you think i'm being an annoying doofus.  carl, i found the braindrain helmet and got here as fast as i...  leaping electronswhat happened to sheen's head.  neutron, this has your stink all over it.  jimmy, sheen's brain is still growing, and he's also being an annoying doofus.  i knew it.  sheen, the math test is over, so it's time to turn you back to normal.  i don't want to go back.  i'm seeing things clearly for the first time.  besides, everyone loves the new me.  all: no, we don't.  silence.   trust me, sheen, you don't want to be a geniusalways having to help people with homework...  always endangering the town with your stupid inventions.  always being a pain in the butt.  nobody asked you.  so i'll put this helmet back on your head, and...  don't come any closer, neutron.  butch, nick, grab him.  you disappoint me, jimmy.    ] whoa...  today's special...  the absofruitalicioustaste of two colors in every puff.  rasporangey orange.  a fruitly symphony.  lemony green, tasty with a twist.  and berry, berry, blueee.  silly rabbit, trix are for kids.   trix swirls the...absofruitalicious...   part of a good breakfast.   almost like the puzzle piece i've been tryna find    falls right into place you're all that it takes    falls right into pl  my doubts fade away when i'm kissing you    hey, little big head.  i just cleaned there.  my intelligence is wasted here.  i should be building empires, commanding armies.  today, retroville, tomorrow, the world.  don't tell me that's just hormones.  i don't understand it.  i was only trying to boost his iq so he'd pass the math test.  oh, is that all.  and what if we all went around freakishly enlarging our friends' heads.  ooh, me first, me first.  was that a rhetorical question.  carl, follow me.  right behind you, jimmy.  vox, analyze braingain helmet to determine maximum possible iq increase.  vox: analyzing.  jimmy: it's just like i feared.  if left unchecked, sheen's iq will keep growing to infinity.  wow, he'll be really good at board games.  no, carl, you don't understand.  sheen's brain is programmed to keep growing.  if we don't get that braindrain helmet on him soon, his head will explode.   ew.   sheen: attention, retroville.  i said...  : "attention, retroville."  don't be alarmed, unless you find it alarming that i'm declaring myself supreme overlord of the town, in which case, be very alarmed.   and now, for my queen, i shall choose the fairest and most beautiful of the town's females.  i'm afraid of commitment.  i didn't mean you.  libby folfax, come on down.  oh, he must be bugging.   libby: get me down.  reign with me, libby.  together we shall rule retroville in glory.  i don't think so.  but you'll be a model.  portraits will depict you in the finest robes and jewelry.  sheen, there is no way i'm...  did you say robes and jewelry.  what the hecki'll give it a shot.  huzzah.  sheen said he wanted to rule an empire.  disguising the braindrain helmet as a crown might convince him to put it on.  but jimmy, what if he reads our minds.  just keep your mind on other things.  think of baby llamas frolicking in the meadow.  okay.  oh, look at him.  hi, baby llam...   so you see, libby, the force between any two bodies is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.  sheen, let them down.  no, that's gravity.  we haven't gotten there yet.  hail, mighty overlord.  what the...  we have brought you a magnificent crown, crafted from the finest semiprecious metals, to celebrate your glorious reign.  hmm...  it is rather fetching.  bestow it on my head.  not you...  carl.  : baby llamas in the meadow.  baby llamas in the meadow.  oh, no, one of them's escaping.  he's heading towards town.  "town" rhymes with "crown".  jimmy and i disguised the braindrain helmet as a crown.  i heard that.  sheen, please, we're trying to help you.  your brain is growing at a dangerously fast pace.  silence.  you have plotted against the overlord.  your insolence has angered me.  oh, no.  jimmy, i don't like lightning.  it makes my hair stand up funny.  dance, you tinybrains.   keep dodging, carl.  i have an idea.  what's going on.  i've deflected the lightning by turning that radio antenna into a supermagnet.  hmm... very resourceful.  but let's see how quickly you think in...  quicksand.   libby, what kind of decor were you thinking of for our castle.  oh, sheen, stop it.  you're hurting carl and jimmy.  i prefer a classic contemporary feel, but i'd consider french colonial.  this is the end.  my entire life's flashing before my eyes.  goodbye, world.  okay, why aren't i sinking.  carl, your high bodyfat content is making you sink less quickly.  maybe you could reach into my knapsack.  jimmy, i'm sure miss fowl will give us extensions on our homework.  just do it.  now, feel around for my shrink ray.  found it.  good.  aim it at that light post.   bravo, very impressive.  you've had your fun, sheen.  now, let us go.  yeah, just let them go, sheen.  hmm... i do grow bored.  perhaps it is time i spare you.  "spare," get it.  it's a pun.    poor sheen.  "poor sheen".  he just used us to practice his seven/ten split.  yeah, but his head's still going to explode, and sheen's still our best friend somewhere deep down.  wait a minutethat's it.  hey, yeah.  now, when you say, "it"....  somewhere deep inside that giant brain is the old sheen.  if we can reach that part of him, we might have a chance.  well, how do we do that.  i control the wind, and i shall rain fire down from the heavens.  goodbye, sheen the overlord.  hello, sheen the god.   that's it, i've had it with you and your big, freaky head.  wait, come back.  you'll like being the wife of a god.  i'll let you choose the patio furniture.  : greetings, one called "sheen." ultra lord.  left, right...  left.  okay, stop, carl.  is it really you.  you betcha.  i have come to welcome you to the pantheon of the superpowerful.  wait a minute.  how do i know you're not an impostor.  hmm... i see your point.  well, i guess i'll be on my way.  wait, don't go.  it's just the odds of meeting the actual ultra lord at this very moment are 16,755 to one.  well, if you want to make sure it's me, why not ask me a series of difficult trivia questions.  hey, good idea.  be ready on the ultra lord web site, carl.  i'm on it, jimmy.  where were you born.   on planet mektar, in vector 8 of the nebulon galaxy.  good.  what's your favorite snack.  nitrogen bar and a decaf latte.  correctwhat did robofin say when you blasted him with your ion ray.   ow.  that's right.  he said "ow." yeah, you are ultra lord.  join me, ultra lord.  with my brains and your magnacanons, we'll rule the universe.  it's a deal, but first i need an ultra favor.  anythingjust name it.  i need you to... drain your brain.  huh.  but... but why.  you're too smart.  the other superpowerful guys will think you're annoying.  i won't do it.  your hero, ultra lord, commands you.  i won't.  put it on.  you dare to order me.  feel the wrath of my brain.   jimmy...  and carl.  what have i done.  i've lost my two best friends in the world.  what good is it to be ruler of the world if it means destroying everything you once held dear.  on the other hand, i'd never have to do my own laundry.  no, no, no...  it's got to be done.  goodbye, brain, old friend.  sheen.  jimmy. jimmy.  thank goodness you're alive.  i thought i'd lost you guys forever.  hey, sheen, your head's not horrendously bulbous anymore.  carl, old buddy, i've learned a priceless lesson today.  you mean about how friendship is an immutable bond that can weather the harshest storm.  yeah, something like that.  so how long do i get to keep the costume.  ow, that hurt.  ow, that hurt.  maybe it's worn off by now.  ow, that hurt.  ow, that hurt.  ow, that hurt.  ow, that hurt.  no, sheen, the chemical name of salt is not hermie schwartzbohm.   don't worry, sheen.  at least acing the math test means you won't be left back.  i'm glad i'm not a genius anymore.  it's too much pressure.  that's the spirit.  so you want to come over and watch tv.  i can'ti got a job offer yesterday.  i need the money.  check you later.  hello, and welcome to advanced chemical engineering.  my name's professor sheen, and i shall be learning you today.  captioning sponsored by the ent epartmen @xo7wx.xo7w +0@k 8o@7 @:x/xo(]   thump. both: whoa.   here we go 'cause we're fanboy and chum chum    a little cuckoo, fanboy and chum
