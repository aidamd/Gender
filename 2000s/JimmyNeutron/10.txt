your top agent jet fusion.  others: that's what we said, he never listens to me.  no murmuring.  agent fusion is on vacation.  can we count on your help.  i don't know.  i'm prepared to cry and beg.  i'll take the case. good.  when beautiful gorgeous was in prison, we inserted a tracking device in her brain to help you locate her.  is that legal.  uh... yes, eh... oh, look.  a spy satellite.  where.   good luck, neutron.  thanks for letting us come along on another topsecret mission.  aw, it wouldn't be as fun without you guys.  that's for sure.   carl, this is a topsecret spy mission, not

handsome as ever.  beautiful's trying to strangle jet.  let's move, spies.   : jimmy neutron.  jet, she was trying to strangle you.   that's the silliest thing i've ever heard.  she was just tying my bowtie on.  you got to wear a tuxedo when you get hitched.  all three: huh.  who's the lucky gal.  that would be... me.  congratulate us, jimmy.  we're getting married.  what....  married. you and beautiful gorgeous.  but... jet, she tried to annihilate us on mount everest.  she's your mortal enemy.  that's all ancient history.  now she's my little snookyukums, isn't she.  isn't she.  what bizarre, unfathomable universe have we entered.  being in jail those long two weeks changes a person, jimmy.  i was tired of being evil and when i got out i went to apologize to jet and...  we fell in

see me acting a fool over some pretty girl.  libby: hey, sheen.   how do you like my impersonation of a timber wolf for our nature assignment.  looks pretty good, but work on your howl.  no prob.  so libby, you want to sing at jet and bg's wedding.  regular rate, cash up front, no checks or credit cards.  and ask cindy if she'll videotape it.   jimmy, she's using a laser beam on jet.  sheen: jet, look out.   jet, she's a beautiful but evil vixen.  whose middle name is danger.  beautiful "danger" gorgeous fusion.  she was trying to laser you with a laser.  we were just engraving our wedding rings.  oh... right.  yeah.  well, sorry.  we'll see you later.  sheen: she's a witch, i tells ya.  burn her. burn her. burn her.  : oh, jet.   this could get dangerous.  if beautiful tries anything, we may have to get our hands dirty.  that's okay.  i always carry sanitary wipes.  maybe we should call the a.m.s.f.s. for backup.  you never heard of the atomic monkeys special forces squad.  trained monkeys dedicated to fighting crime and pursuing justice whenever they are called upon.  no. no.  you know, jet, i've never told anyone this before, but you know what i've always wanted to be ever since i was a little girl.  one of those people that puts those little plastic tips on the end of shoelaces.  how did you know.  y, garon.  can we get some nachos and buffalo wings over here.  shh.  sheen, we can't attract attention to ourselves.  . lala, lalala. .  wait. bolbi know you from somewhere.  you are the donkey boyssuperfamous rock band from bekhanistan.  no, we're not.  go away.  bolbi wants your autograph.  get out of... the way.  jet. watch out.  hey. what are you doing.  saving your life again.  she was trying to...  practice cutting the wedding cake at the reception.  with that, jimmy.  uh... well... no.  i guess not.  unless... there's a bomb in the cake.  the only thing dangerous in this cake is the 20,000 calories.  a likely story.   apparently it was a likely story.  jimmy, i know this all seems strange, but i love beautiful.  she's left the whole villainess thing behind.  i really have changed, jimmy.  please believe me.  i'm in love with her, kid.  i want to be with her till the day i die.  i swear on the big book of spy rules.  okay, i... i guess i was wrong.  sorry, beautiful.  so what do i do as best man.  very simple.  when commander baker asks, "who has the ring." you just say, "i have the ring." okay, i'll see you at the wedding.  but i want cake.  goodbye, donkey boys.  . lala, lalala. .  guess they really arein love.  duh. she's beautiful and gorgeous.  yeah, she's almost as pretty as your moth...  : . we're spies .  . we're three guys .  . we don't have hives .  . but we're spies. .  jettikins, i have a very important question to ask you.  ask away, my little bucket of love.  do you think we should have these kind of candies at the reception.  funny looking candy.  looks like a strange rotating disk that hypnotiz...  listen to me closely.  the next person who says "i have the ring," destroy them.   well, jet, in about an hour you'll be a married secret agent, movie star, action sports guy.  yeah.  well, thanks for meeting me here, guys.  i have to admit i'm nervous.  hey, jimmy, are you nervous about being best man.  why. what's the big deal.  all he's got to do is say, "i have the ring."   goddard, nonlethal stun.  huh.   you okay, kid.  barely felt it.  sorrymust be prewedding nerves.  would you guys excuse me.  i need to do some, uh... best man things.  uh, mr. fusion, do you know the spy song.  uh... no, and i don't think i want to.  but you can sing it because you're a spy.   . you're a spy guy even more than i .  . and i bet you don't cry .  . when you get bumped in your eye .  . or when jimmy's mom says goodbye. .  something is rotten in retroville, and i think i know who's behind it.  a wedding dress and a mourning gowni can't wait to wear them...  on the same day.   jimmy. didn't your mother teach you to knock.  tell me what you're up to, and i mean now.  why, jimmy, whatever could you be talking about.  jet just attacked sheen, and i think you're behind it.  as an agent of the btso, i'm taking you into custody.  is that a hypnoray.  could be.  all right, you've got me.  i knew i couldn't outsmart someone like you.  just let me get my...   i knew you hadn't changed.  i was born bad and beautiful and i'll stay that way.  too bad you'll only enjoy my evilness for a few hours.   why are we going to see beautiful gorgeous.  i got to ask her if it's okay to play theultra lordtheme song when she walks down the aisle.  so what's your evil plan this time, beautiful.  i might as well tell you, since you have a starring role.  when you say "i have the ring" at the wedding, witnesses.  you'll be eliminated, jet'll go to jail for it and i'll have rid the world of the two best crime fighters alive.  hello, slight problem.  how am i supposed to go to the wedding if i'm locked up..  way ahead of you.  i'll just erase the last 30 minutes of your memory with this.  you'll forget everything.  huh.  what am i doing here.   hey, i got to get to the wedding.  this really is the happiest day of my life.  busted, beautiful.  we heard everything.  give up and we'll go easy on you.  yeah.  please.  come and get me, boys.   all right...  you we how about two out of three.  no way.  too bad you're going to miss the wedding.  it's one jet and jimmy will never forget.   that laugh could get annoying.  so neutron's the best man.  yeah, more like best nerd.  i bet he'll look like a...  hunk muffin...  oh, hi... james.  hey, cindy.  hey, cin, put your eyes back in your head and let's get to work.  cindy: i can't believe itneutron looks handsome.  oh, no, that's going to be on the tape.  wait, everybody.  technical difficulties.  got to rewind.   okay, hit it.   who gives this gorgeous woman to be wed.  iher father, professor finbar calamitous, evil genius, an innocent victim, currently rotting in jail for a crime i did not commit...  do.  now jet's going to attack jimmy and we'll miss the wedding.  no, we won't.  i'll call the atomic monkeys special forces squad.   sheen, even someone like mewho believes in fairies, leprechauns and pixiesknows there's no such thing as...   thank you, colonel mcswain.  i owe you oneand you owe someone an apology.  sorry, colonel mcswain.   come on, we've got a wedding to stop.  dearly beloved, friends, assorted secret agents...   hurry up, we got to get to the church before jimmy says, "i have the ring." dang it.  it's the annual retroville marching band parade.   we are gathered here today to join this secret agent and this reformed villainess in matrimony.  hurry, we got to save...   dang it.  it's the annual
