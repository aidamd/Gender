 d off my enemies but it's terrorizing my friends.  it's like i'm the bully.  hey, jimbo, there you are.  son, let's talk about girls.  well, girls are like a piping hot slice of pie with a big scoop of confusion on top.  confusion.  that's it.  pie time. honey.  oh, nanobots, watch this.  owner under attack.  and your head's too big, too.  he's under attack. get him.  we can't get himhe's him.  what do we do.  you tell me, captain.  i'm just a stewardess, remember.  trying to crawl away from me, huh.  primary command must be obeyed.  take that.  cannot obey.  program data overload.   how come you get the parachute.  quiet, or i'll detach my ankle.  hugh, birds, bees, now.   jimmy... i...  it's okay, dad.  i don't have a problem anymore.  terry moved to another school...  oh, there'll be other terrys, honey.  let's have some hot chocolate.  now wait a minute.  just wait a darn minute, you two.  i'm ready to give the talk, and gosh darn it i'm going to give the talk and i'm going to do it right now.  hmm.  you see, goddard boys are one way and girls, well, they're another way entirely.  then there's ducks.    ah, life is good.  the sun is shining, my body is coursing with sugar and my treasured action figure waits right here where i left him, under the big oak tree...      ooooh..  "the ultra shock dance teacher 8000".  exactly. by sending shocks to your major muscle groups in a manner corresponding to popular dance steps it actually teaches you to dance.  does it hurt. hurt.  what's a little pain compared to the trauma of looking like a dork at your high school prom.  initiate mambo sequence.  ah... jimmy.  carl, i haven't even turned it on yet.  that wasn't me.  what. these walls are lined with three feet of lead compounds.  no one's voice could possibly ever pierce...  jimmy, it's sheen. let me in.  come on, i'm not kidding.      hey, sheen, what's up.  you can look at my shockingly empty hands and ask me that.  i've been robbed.  robbed of what.  only my oldest and most prized ultra lord.  he was like the plastic atomic, breathblasting brother i never had.  sheen, calm down.  just tell us what happened.  okay... okay... okay...  i took ultra lord to the park to play with him.  i turned my back for five minutes to buy some ice cream.  and when i came back he was gone.  you got to help me, jimmy.  if you don't i'll have to ask complete idiots to help me and you know how unreliable they are.  well, it is a chance to pit my brain against the criminal element.  i'll take the case.  yes.  and i'll solve it with science.  thank you, jimmy.   do you hear that, evildoers.  ultra lord will be avenged.  hey, look at me.  i've got feet of flames.   dadadadada    dadadadada    dadadadada.   hey, jimmy, if you just asked me i'd have lent you some stupid looking clothes.  this happens to be the signature look of super sleuth and master of deduction sherlock holmes.  really. how come he couldn't deduct how stupid his hat looked.  carl, here's a notepad.  as watson to my holmes your job will be to write down all the clues.  to the crime scene.  now, sheen, where did you last see ultra lord.  right there.  he looked so peaceful with his destructobelt and hydraulic flamethrower.  goddard, neutrascope.  according to city records the ice cream truck stops in the park at 11:27 a.m. every morning.  my neutrascope's highly sensitive heat detectors will show us all the life forms that passed by this exact spot between 11:27 and sheen's return five minutes later.  goddard, identify biomasses.  carl: cindy and humphrey...  jimmy's mom...  a cute little squirrely...  and nick.  hmm. eliminate the squirrel and we're left with three suspects.  cindy, nick, and my own mother.  it's her. your mother did it.  jimmy's the spawn of thieves.  or it could be nick or cindy.  i think it's time to have a chat with our suspects.  well, hey little squirrel.  we're on a detective case.  um, sheen, he lost his ultra lord...  jimmy: carl. coming.  cindy: yes, i saw sheen in the park.  no, i didn't take his dumb doll.  it's not a doll, it's an action figure.  brutally arrest her.  back off, doll boy.   anyway, what motive could i possibly have for taking it.  tell her, carl.  hi.  huh. oh.  remember yesterday in class...  and that's my report.  any questions.  uh, yes.  uh, i accidentally flicked a scab off my elbow and it landed on your shirt.  can i have it back.   get off me.   so, he's a dgusting idiot.  but i didn't take his doll.  then i'm sure you won't mind submitting to a liedetector test.  goddard.  hey.  did you take sheen's ultra lord.  no.  what about humphrey.  what about him.  he was with you. maybe he ate it.  humphrey doesn't eat garbage.   she's lying.  i am not.   ahha.  the polygraph never lies.  oh, uh, but i...  well, that's not...  okay, i admit it.  i fed sheen's stupid doll to humphrey to get revenge.  but humphrey barfed it back up and we left the park. i swear.  jimmy: mmm, she seems to be telling the truth.  but just to be sure...  goddard, xray the suspects clothes.   thanks for your help.  you're free to go.  carl, make a note that suspect judy neutron is dusting the front lawn.  carl.  here's a cute, fluffy little squirrely.  you are...  jimmy: carl.  okay.  hi, boys. there's freshbaked fudge nellies in the kitchen.  i need to ask you some questions, mom.  if thatis your real name.  what kind of questions.  judy neutron, did you happen to pass the big oak tree in the park between the hours of 11:27 and 11:32 this morning.  what's this all about.  and why are you dressed like sherlock holmes.  ma'am, please let my partner ask the questions.  and is it not true that you're a cardcarrying member of the town antilitter league.  well, yes, but i still don't see...  then, isn't it possible that while jogging in the park this morning you spotted an action figure lying on the ground and threw it away due to your obsessive need to tidy up.  james isaac neutron, in this household courtroomstyle interrogations means chores for a week.  goddard, black light check of the suspect's hands.  oh, your father will hear about this, young man.  mom, your hands test positive for the exact type of plastic that ultra lords are made of.  well, that's because i...  i mean, you don't think that i...  all right, it's true that a filthy doll made a mockery of every tree and daffodil in that park.  i simply had to throw it away in the trash.  case closed. book her, jimo.  but i couldn't.  it was disgusting and covered in dog slobber.  i ran home to get my rubber gloves but your father wouldn't let me have them.  a likely story.  what would dad possibly want with your rubber gloves.  hey, boys.  look at me. i'm cocky the rooster man.  cockadoodledoo.  cockadoodle... hey, mother hen want to have a pecking party.  make way for rooster man.  half rooster, half man.  all hugh.  case open again.  now, how about those fudge nellies.  nick's our last remaining suspect.  that means he must be our perp.  halt, criminal.   hey, guys.  whoa. nice duds, dude.  you lose a bet.  nick, yesterday you were overheard coveting sheen's ultra lord action figure.  uh, i don't think so.  tell him, carl.  remember yesterday in the hallway.  man, i'd do anything to get my hands on that new styling mousse i read about.  too bad it's 53 bucks.  53 bucks.  what a coincidence.  that's how much this particular ultra lord is worth.  really. well, then i should totally steal it.  i never said that.  you might as well have.  you clearly stole ultra lord to keep yourself in fine grooming products.  nick, i'm afraid i have to test a lock of your hair for the existence of the incriminating mousse.  hmm. let me respond to that in the following way...  that nick makes a forceful point.  very.  mission accomplished.  negative.  i don't understand it.  i interrogated the suspects tested their alibis using cuttingedge science...  i should have a culprit by now.  don't feel bad, jimmy.  you tried your best.  it just wasn't anywhere near good enough.  i must have missed something.  carl, give me your notes.  the answer's got to be here somewhere.   okay, now about the notes, jimmy, they're...  squirrel... squirrel... squirrel... squirrel...  more squirrels.  carl, these notes are completely useless.  bbut, jimmy, you should have seen them.  they were so cute and cuddly andand...  i'm a bad watson.  wait a minute.  sherlock holmes once said "when you've eliminated the impossible whatever remains must be the truth." hey, yeah.  i don't get it.  to the park.  just as i suspected.  gentlemen, our ultra lord thief.    what strange, bizarre rituals could they be performing.    they're using ultra lord as a nutcracker.  give me my action figure, you stupid squirrel.  where's your respect for ultra lord.  you think he'll ever get it back.  that, my dear carl is a mystery even i can't solve.  put down that stick. ow.  somebody call an ambulance.  ] whoa...  today's special...  the absofruitalicioustaste of two colors in every puff.  rasporangey

pretty peggy sui...  : do you think she's married.  get your tongue off the floor.  it was princess sui who contacted me.  goddard, activate holoprogram 7a.   7ai said 7a.  sui: this is the eggdrop jade, a priceless gem that has been in my family for generations.  the jade has an unstable atomic structure which can channel near infinite amounts of raw energy.  knowing this, my evil brother, a boy named sui, has built a deadly doomsday device.  when powered by the egg, this device could enslave the entire free world.  and that's where we come in.  the egg's currently on display at the retroville museum.  the security system is stateoftheart, but that won't stop us.  you want us to help you rob the retroville museum.  have you popped a synapse.  the egg has got to be secured before peggy's evil brother steals it.  and to do that, i'll need your help.  pinch me, libby, i'm in shock.  you needourhelp.  i can't do it by myself.  jimmy: you've all been chosen for this operation because you each posses a unique skill.  really. what's my skill, jimmy.  it's personal hygiene, isn't it.  well, um... actually, carl, i was hoping you could stay and keep the princess company while we're gone.  but i want to help save the free world, too.  please let me help, jimmy.  please, please, please, please, please, please...  if it's for the good of the free world, then i guess we'll helpjust shut him up.  okay, carl...  carl, okay.   you can help by, um... uh...  by providing nourishing snacks for quick energy.  yay.  who likes fruit chewies.  so, bearing in mind that carl will provide snacks, here's the plan.  hey, lou.  i caught this kid sneaking around the service entrance.  very suspicious.  what are you doing here, kid.  : hello, my name is petesteve. steve.  and i am a diversioni mean, i am collecting money for the united magicians retirement fund.  i love magicians.  hey, kid, you know any magic card tricks.  do i.  allow me to direct your attention away from the wall of security monitors.  the guards should be distracted right about now.  jimmy: this hypersonic blast will be nasty, but it should freeze the alarm system.  ready, libby.       the alarms will stay frozen as long as you sustain that note, libby.  everyone else, go.  stop. nobody move.  jimmy: good call, carl.  how did you know there were pressure sensors.  i didn't, i just thought we could use a snack.  you're up, cindy.  can you reach that control box without setting foot on the pressure sensors.  with the energy boost from this raspberry chewy she can.    we've got ten secondshurry.  the sensors are back online.  stay where you are, cindy.  no problem.  but you'll come back, right.  right.  is this your card.  no...  oh.  well, isthisyour card.  for the tenth timeno.  sheesh,

carl.  goddard will lower me down on tension wires and.   oh, no.  goddard must have suffered hypersonic damage from libby's high note.  it's up to you, carl.  i'll have to lower you down while you retrieve the egg.  me.  just replace the real jade egg with this replica, and we're done.  let's do it.     ooh...  look at the pretty lights.  don't touch them, carl.  those are infrared security
