 let me see.  well, neutron, say something.  aah. our rubies.  these aren't real asterrubies.  they're fool's rubies.  fool's rubies.  they're almost identical to asterrubies.  the scanner mistook them for the real thing.  looks like we came all this way for nothing.  bummer.  can i keep playing with my shovel.   thanks, goddard.  maybe my homemade burritos will cheer everyone up.  how could you misread your own readings.  neutron, i'll bet there are more rocks in your big head than there are in this stupid asteroid.  what do we do now.  i don't know.  we could spend years searching the belt.  we'd just be wasting our time.  hey, look on the bright side, guys.  at least we still have our health.  ow.  carl, what did you put in this burrito.  nothing.  just some rice from the galley and some beans i found growing in the ground.  wwait a minute.  carl, take us to where you found these beans.  right now.  okay, i dug them up right here.  what's wrong.  aren't they in season.  sheen: look.  all the beans we need.  tonight we feast.  we did it.  we struck asterrubies.   neutron, will you stop making an idiot of yourself.  why are we...   carl, may i have this happy, giggly prospectors' dance.  i'd be delighted.   what a bunch of adorable, happy children.  it's a shame they'll have to be vaporized.    sweetie, could you get that.  ooh.  i'm busy making campthemed cookies for jimmy's care package.  oh, but i'm busy pressing jerky for jimmy's care package.  oh, all right.  hello.  man : this is counselor chip.  your child...  jimmy: jimmy.  chip: is having a totally awesome time at camp.  he does request, however, that you send more socks, so he can keep his feet warm on the chilly mountain and/or coastal nights.  okay.  later.  sugarbooger, drop those cookies.  we've got to get to the sock outlet, pronto.    hello.  vortex residence.  chip: s'up, dude.  your child...  cindy: cindy.  chip: is having a totally awesome time at camp.   lunch break, everybody.  boy, that vein goes on forever.  we're going to be so rich.  what are you going to do with your money, cindy.  nothing fancy.  i plan to live a simple, modest lifestyle.   that's cool.  how about you.  me. i'm going to establish the free nation of kickitopia, where under my queenship, the people's right to party shall not perish from this earth.  that's a good one, libby, but you know what i'm going to do.  i'm going to retire to south america, where i'll become a worldchampion llama breeder.  oh, me.  pick me.  just tell us.  okay.  i'll use my great wealth to combat crime.  let all evildoers beware the wrath of dingleman.   that's not bad, sheen.  as for me, there's one thing i've always dreamed of possessing.  and now it'll be mine.  all mine.  i'm glad being fabulously wealthy won't change us.    what was that.  disrupter blast.  take cover.    who's out there.  oh, gee, sorry, kids.  my darn blaster must have misfired.  who are you jerks.  us.  why, uh, we're, um...  we're, uh, asteroid inspectors.  yeah, that's it.  we're asteroid inspectors.  oh, this stinks.  if you're asteroid inspectors, then let's see your badges.   uh, libby, i don't think they need no stinking badges.  by the way, thanks ever so much for mining these asterrubies for us.  what..  in your dreams.  those are our rubies, you rotten bandits.  bandits.  that kind of talk hurts, little girl.  mmhmm, hurts bad.  besides, you don't really want these rubies.  haven't you heard of ruby madness.  ruby madness.  i'm glad you asked.  anyone who finds a vein of asterrubies becomes consumed with horrible greed.  i've seen it happen dozens... hundreds...  thousands of times.  if i could only reach the crane controls.  goddard...  defensive plan delta.   aw, look, they've got a cute little robot doggie.  i pity that dog.   get those kids.  mmm, it's delicious, but so spicy.  oh.  one more step and you're space toast.  all right, all right, you win this round, kid.  but remember what i said about ruby madness.  it won't be long until you're all at each other's throats.  and we'll be waiting.   uh, do you think he was telling the truth about ruby madness.  oh, please, like we'd really turn against each other.  hey, that one's mine.  give it to me.  with those bandits around, we should probably keep the rubies somewhere safe.  good point.  the vault back at the rocket is the best place.  how come you get to hold the rubies.  in a safe that onlyyou know the combination to.  ruby madness.  ruby madness.  it's tearing us apart.  carl, easy.  there is no such thing as ruby madness.  if it makes you feel better, let's divide each day's take.  everyone can be responsible for their share.  fine. fine.  sheen: fine.  chip :..  carl: carl.  chip: has made some totally excellent macaroni sculpture, but he does request that you send more tick b gone.  forget the snake antivenin, mother.  our little boy is being swarmed by ticks.   and bingo was his nameo    bitz    btste    dlmne    and bingo was his nameo.   i'll give you three seconds to get away from my stash.  what are you talking about.  i was just going to the little miner's room.  like you had no idea these were here.  hey, sweet hiding place.  my rubies are over there by that strange rock formation.  you made me tell.  you want my rubies, you jewel thief.  gem stealer.  ruby madness.  ruby madness.  will you stop shouting that.  he tried to raid my ruby stash.  you told me your stash was by the rocket.  you lied.  i know you lied about your hiding place.  liar.  crook.  ruby madness.  all: be quiet.  what's wrong with you guys.  you've been fighting since we got rid of those bandits.  are we going to let a few priceless gems turn us into savages.   goddard, no.  bad dog.  hey, jimmy had his rubies hidden holographically.  jimmy's a jewel hoarder.  i'll bet he's got secret stashes all over the asteroid.  maybe we can find them by using the mining crane.   jimmy: guys... goddard.  what have i done.  hey, let go.  i discovered them.  what.. i saw them first.   whoa.   ruby...  madness.  aah. guys, stop.  you can't just blast away like that.  the asteroid might implode.   oopsy.   okay, that's my bad.  this entire asteroid is going to collapse.  we've got to get to the roct.  but the... my rubies.  engaging primary ignition...  now.  whew.  we made it.  keep on them, boys.   it's the bandits.  they'll get our rubies.  i might be able to lose them by using a hyperthrust, but it could dangerously deplete our fuel.  just do it.  whoa.  for the love of nebula.   that was awesome, i swear.  hush your mouth, fool.  our rubies are safe.  well, not quite.  we've drifted too close to jupiter and are being sucked in by its gravity, and the hyperthrust exhausted all our fuel.  uh, in english, please.  we're doomed.  oh, thank you.  we do have one chance.  if i convert the charged photons in the asterrubies into emergency fuel, we can slingshot around jupiter, using its gravity.  usemyrubies as fuel.  never.  cindy, we have to.  it's your rubies or your life.  cindy.  what.. i'm thinking.  oh, all right.  fasten your seat belts, people.  this could get a little bumpy.     look, sugarbooger, jimbo's home from camp.   sweetie, you're home so soon.  we haven't even finished the whitewate sculling canoe we were going to send you.  um, well, that's okay, mom.  thanks, anyway.   neutron, the fuel tank.  see if any of the asterrubies made it.  oh.  don't worry, guys.  maybe we're still wealthy.  you mean you saved some rubies..  no, but we survived by learning to help each other, and that's what makes us richrich in friendship.   captioning sponsored by the u.s. depducat of edu charms, mmm...   did you see that.  whoa wait.  over there.  what.
