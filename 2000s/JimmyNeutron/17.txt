 where no teacher has gone before.   miss fowl: i've got a good idea who's responsible for this.   friends, students, kids: lend me your ears.  you may have noticed that miss fowl isn't here this morning.  shouldn't they have returned from learnerpalooza by now.  thanks to my new hyperchip, none of our teachers will be back for an entire week.   let's watch llama videos.    let's party.     neutron, what did you do to our teachers.  all i did was send them on a little side trip through hyperspace.  they'll be back in a week, safe and sound.  both: . no teachers. no teachers. no teachers.  .  spread the word, peopleschool's out.   i'm king of the world.  jimmy: coming through. watch it.  hey, what's wrong with my rocket board.   mom.  you are so grounded, mister.  she's right, jimbo.  i'm afraid your senseless reign of carnage is over.  carl: hi, jimmy.  you said to spread the word, so i told our parents.  aw.  you bring your teachers back this instant.  ii can't.  they're programmed to come back in a week.  then we will have to round these children up ourselves.  man : kids. oh, kids.  allow me, hon.  quiet....   judy: childrenplease go to your classrooms.  until miss fowl and the others return, we parents will be filling in as substitute teachers.   substitute teachers.  good idea, judy.  the kids shouldn't miss one precious day of education.  m, d, you can't do this.  it'll be totally embarrassing.  don't be silly, jimbo.  your mother would neverdream of embarrassing you.  no... don't.  yuck.  now, now, we don't want to be a mr. smudgeyface, do we.   "mr. smudgeyface." talk about being stripped of all dignity.  judy: your turn, butch.   i've lived too long.  i'm next.  again.  oh, this couldn't get more humiliating.  before we go on, let's look at jimmy's baby pictures.   now, kids, as carl is now demonstrating, germfree back skin begins at home.  harder, son.  you show those germs who's boss.  cindy: hey, carl.  can you come over and washmyparents.   now, now, kids.  my carl knows that good health and hygiene is nothing to be ashamed of.  right, son.  right, dad.  great.  now let's show 'em how to lance a boil.   remember, kids, working with wood can be a great family activity.  my son sheen and i made these pretty dollies together in our spare time.   dad, they're not dollies.  they're actionplay companions.  some nights, instead of tv, sheen will pretend to be the little girl doll and i'll be her magic flying pony.  ing)  don't be sad, sheen.  let's fly away to happy rainbow mountain.    kids, the book my wife gave me says that gym class should build selfesteem.  everyone turn around and hug your neighbor.   all right, all right.    okey dokey, let's move on to the trust exercises.   sheen: could our parents have embarrassed us more today.  what's wrong, carl.  is my sevenlayer soy mulch too tough.  let mommy prechew it for you.     mmm...   i mean, gross.  you boys enjoy.  i can't take it anymore.  i actually wish we had our teachers back.  are you going to finish your soy mulch.  parents want to be substitute teachers, huh.  well, i say it's time to sink some subs.  grubber: elbow, elbow.  keep searching, everyone.  we're looking for some type of shiny blinky sciencey gizmo.  do they have restrooms in hyperspace.  grubber: i'm keeping any change i find.  jimmy: almost done, goddard.  the secret weapon that'll make our parents run screaming from the school.  i call it "rebellion." it's a concentrated version of the hormone that makes kids challenge authority.  one whiff of this and they'll run amok.  faced with such sheer raw mayhem, the parents will be forced to bail.   sheen: psst.  psstpsst.  sheen : jimmy.  carl and i have decided to run away and join the carney circuit. you in.  you won't need to.  i've got the answer to our problems.  judy: jimmy.  carl and sheen: ow.  what have you got.   uhoh.  is that one of your experiments.  bring it up.   you know you're grounded from doing science.  bbut mom...  no buts.  you march off to your next class.  i'm going to keep this in a safe place.   neutron, this coffee you made is absolutely delicious.  thanks, but my secret ingredient is the lowcal sweetener judy brought.  hugh, that's not lowcal sweetener.  that's the bottle i took from jimmy this morning.  well, it tastes marvelous.  s,sorobusto.  oh... dear.  guys, we've got to get back that hormone bottle.  it could be highly toxic to adults.   i'm sick of all the rules around here, man.  this place is totally bogus.  i told you not to come into my room.  whatever.  you arenot the boss of me.  oh, no. they've been exposed to the hormone.  guys, try to calm your parents down.  kid: ow....  stop.   jimmy: mom, dad.  stop shooting those spitballs right now.  who's going to make us.  you.  as if.  ah. no.  hey, don't.  man: give me that.  dad, stop.  you just can't take people's stuff.  you're about to get served, chumps.    dad, i'm warning you.  behave yourself.  you can't tell me what to do.  stop trying to ruin my life.   grubber: ow. the elbow.  it's no use.  we've looked everywhere.   ooh, and it's getting musty in here.  coach grubber, could you grab a fresh stick of pine scent from the glove compartment.  grubber: hey, what the heck is this.  one of jimmy's gadgets.  i knew we'd find it.  what happens if you press this button.   let's trash this place.   all: food fight.  guys, stop.  you've got to listen.  you've been exposed to a concentrated hormone.  if you don't calm down, it could damage your endocrine system.  hmm... what do you think, jude.  get him.   calm down, people.  you don't want this on your permanent record, do you.      jimmy, i'd like a word with you.  guys, you've got to get these parents under control.  they're loopy and need medical attention.  you can't control us.  no wayyou're totally lame.  parents rebelling against teachers.  has the world gone mad..  folks, i think someone needs some discipline.  good thing i stocked up on teaching aidslike these eraser nunchucks.     and i'm glad i picked up this crate of dodge balls.  look out.  my new highcarb pancake recipe should make them slow and lethargic.    how about you, old woman.  what do you bring to the party, hmm.  young man, in 74 years of teaching, the only thing i've ever needed is my piercing educator's skunkeye.  no, not the skunkeye.  don't look at me.  back. back, i say.    : bicycle...   great job, everyone.  our parents should be back to normal just as soon as they wake up.  thank heavens for that.  as foryou,young man, we found your little hyperspace gizmo.  it'll never happen again.  in fact, i've learned a valuable lesson about the importance of our teaching professionals.  you're still getting 900 days detention.  and no soup on soup tuesday.  in fact, drop and give me 40, maggot, right now.  : but... you're not...  the boss... of me.  doubletime, neutron.  ..  to the toothpick factory.   ..  a danimals vip field trip.

were never proven.  who told you about that.  though it would make a good story for tonight.  did i write "c".  i meant "a".  i always get those confused.  libby: marisa has hair extensions.  girl, how do you know.  you'd better tell me unless you want that ugly tattoo of yours splashed all over prime time.   talk to me.  you call that embarrassing..  call me when you get some real dirt.  uh,

can only imagine what she has on carl.  i don't sniff my own feet.  it just looks that way when i'm doing yoga.  thanks for the stories, guys.  libby, what's happened to you.  look, i'll make a deal: stop your gossip segment and i'll give you...  candy.  no, cindy's coanchor job.   ouch.  excuse me.  i've got to goi need more juicy stories for tonight.  guys, i have an idea.  does it involve candy.  jimmy: no.  libby wants stories, right.  well, let's give her a story she can't resist.  libby: ain't no way miss fowl's a man.   i've got to go, principal willoughby.  come in.  hey, lib.  i wanted to wish you a good show tonight.  oh, and even though our dressing rooms are next to each other, don't look through that peephole into mine.  i'll try to resist, carl.  now, if you'll excuse me, i'm looking for one last story.  okay, well, you won't find your story through that peephole, that's for sure, although you will be shocked and amazed and sickened and disgusted and terrified.  well, got to go.  greetings, mighty alien masters.  greetings, carl of earth.  have you prepared for our arrival.  yes, i have, masters.  have you laid in a supply of kittens for us to snack on.  yes, i have, masters.   excellent.  i knew he'd be a good recipient for our slaveryinducing brain worm.  all: mmmmm.  alien 3: soon we will descend upon your planet and steal the spleens of your species to play spleen ball with.  mm, earth spleens are so bouncy.  it's like a whole different game.  all: mmmmm.  : is that it.  oh, um... okay. bye.     and then the aliens put a worm in carl's brain that makes him their slave.  and they eat kittens, and they're coming to steal our spleens to play spleen ball with.  i'm not kidding.  thanks for that fascinating report, libby.  well, that's the news.  good night and thanks for watching.   oh, that was classic.  : earth spleens.  no one's going to believe libby ever again.  : yeah.  except those guys.  there's the alien slave kid.  get him.   threaten our kittens, hey, buster..  libby, you have to stop them from hurting carl.  yeah, he's not an alien.  we made it all up so you'd lose your credibility.  what..  oh, no.  okay, get ready to pelt him.  wait. stop.  carl's not an alien.  crowd: huh..  carl: what.  but it was on the local news.  i know, but it wasn't true.  those guys tricked me into saying it.    oh.  then pelt them.  crowd: yeah.  wait. stop.  don't pelt them, either.  look, i guess by getting all caught up in being a star, i forced my friends to do what they did.  we forgive you, libby.  and i hope you'll still trust us with the sacred dignity of the local news.  not necessary, because you are all fired.  what..  that's right, i need to make room for my crazy new show, everybody loves hand puppets.  hi, everybody.  yes.  pelt corky.   forgive me, guys.  ah, what the heck.  i guess things worked out okay after all.  come on, let's go home.  carl: um... hello, guys.  wait up.  okay, you're coming back,
