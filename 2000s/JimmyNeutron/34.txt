 mster growling) this has "neutron" written all over it.  how gullible does he think we are.  still... free smoothies.  maybe just a sip.   sheen, carlnow.  go to plan b.    jimmy: i don't understand it.  you were so supposed to laugh.  i had it all planned out perfectly...  whoa.     dertron.  you jerk.  you made smoothie come out our noses.  sorry, ladies, but i needed test subjects for my new quantum replay 9000.  observe what happens when i press "rewind."  both: ew.  and now "fastforward."  neutron, cut it out.   you were right, jimmy.  it's even better the second time.  yeah.  hey, i wonder if it'd still be as sweet the 106th time.  let's find out.  jimmy: rewind.   neutron.  and forward.   when i tell your parents...  and rewind.   you're going to be so...  and forward.   ...dead.  wow, jimbo.  i love your new gadget.  let me try.  come on, come on.  please.  sure, dad.   jimmy: notice how it only affects the objects you point at, thus preserving the integrity of the spacetime continuum.  ooh.  it makes everything all timeloopy.  might i suggest the framebyframe function.   oh, i could do this for hours.  mr. neutron, please.  you're giving us massive brain freeze.  oh, sorry, girls.  uh, son, how do i... you know.  i'll just set it for fiveminute automatic rewind.  that should place them back home.   oh, this thing is amazing, jimjim.  it could be the new fun craze.  let me make sure i get this straight.  i want to go back, let's say, oh, two minutes.  so i set this thingy for 200.  dad, no, no, wait...  then i press this big blue button.  dad.  yee... whoa.  i love the blinding strobe effect.  jimbo, how do you...  jimbo.  jimbo.  here, jimmy, jimmy, jimmy.  ah, well, they must have headed back to the lab.  looks like that means i got this baby all to myself.   ooh. ooh. ooh.  agh.  i feel sick and disorientated.  can we do that again.  um, jimmy, why is it so unseasonably humid.  oh, no.  it can't be.  abundant megaflora...  co2heated atmosphere...  leaping leptons.  my dad didn't send us back two minutes. he sent us back 200 million years.  what did you say.  he sent us back 200 million years.  that's what i thought you said.  without the quantum replay, we're trapped in the late cretaceous period.   carl: jimmy.  did they have mommies who make it go away in the late cretaceous era.  hey, sugarbooger, guess what i've got.  careful, honey.  i was making a pie and i spilled lingonberries all over my nice clean floor.  well, no need to get your curlers in a quandary, honey.  observe.   whew.  where did you get that.  oh, it's jimbo's latest invention.  he calls it the... the...  anyway, i'm the first dad on my block who controls time and space.  hugh neutron. hmm.  i will not have you tampering with the laws of physics.  oh, come on.  now, you march right back and give that back to jimmy immediate...   this is better than pie.   carl: jimmy.  i'm ascared.  can't you build another one of those replay gizmos.  well, i can try.  in the meantime, don't touch anything.  it could catastrophically alter the future.  hey, guys.  how you like your eggs.  poached or smiley faces.   or scrambled.  sheen, no.  you're messing up the timeline.  you don't even know what kind of creature laid those eggs.  jimmy, please.  with our superior human intellect, we could easily outwit anything we run into.    go ahead, jimmy, outwit him.     don't move, carl.  it can't see you if you don't move.  sheen, that theory's been discredited.  run, carl, run.    yabbadabbadoo.   jimmy: carl, no.  sorry, jimmy.  i'm allergic to mushrooms.  it's all in your mind, carl.  just pretend that instead of hiding behind a mushroom, you're at the candy bar, and sam is serving you a triple deluxe chocolate fudge sundae.  oh, yeah...  and it has nuts and butterscotch sauce and whipped cream and...  wait a minute.  oh, no.  what's sam doing.  he's putting something on top of it.  no, it can't be.  it's... it's...  it's a giant mushroom.   hey. prehistoric breath.  down here.   ew... yuck.   that's right, run, you stupid lizard with your silly little arms and your peanutsized brain and your...  uh, sheen, you might hold off on the taunting just a few more minutes.  how come, jim.  because we're still being hunted.    hugh: oh, sam.  i could eat your ice cream all day long.  so i think i will.   ew. that's disgusting.  horrible. gross.  you've been reeating the same ice cream for hours.  it's disgustingyou're out of here.  you're right, sam.  mustn't overdo a good thing.  well, i'll just be going.  just let me finish my purple flurp.    gross. stop.  sweet mercy.   watch out for its retractable claws.  unless it spits venom, then watch out for having your eyes dissolved.  how can i watch if my eyes are dissolved.  no, watch before they're dissolved.  watch my eyes.  that doesn't make any sense.  guys, please.  hey.  where'd it go.   get it off. get it off.  calm down.  he's harmless.   what the heck is it.  wow.  it's an actual leptictidium, one of the very first mammals to evolve.    oh, he's adorable.  sheen: hey...  all he wanted was carl's kaboom bar.  aw...  who's evolved.  who's a cute little leptiticktick...  uh... lalulule...  you know, i'm just going to call him "leppy." hey, let me hold him.  no way.  he's my lep...  give him to me.  guys, no.  we can't interact with any of the native fauna.  it could horribly alter the timeline.  now, let's focus.  we have to find food and shelter.  and i've got to build a duplicate quantum replay. it's our only hope of getting back to our own time.  hey, i think leppy's trying to tell us something.  what is it, boy.  pirates.  space worms.  oh, i love this game.  how many syllables.  okay, sounds like...  oh. wait. i know.   oh, sheen.  sheen.  come back, sheen.  there's no way we can follow them on foot.  sheen's gone.  jimmy, help.  i'm afraid of heights.  oh, and i'm also afraid of pterodactyls.    jimmy, we can't just let that horrible thing take sheen.  but they're miles away by now.  sheen's only hope is for me to construct a duplicate quantum replay.  then we can rewind to right before the pterodactyl grabbed him.   yeah, i know.  i'm sorry, leppy, but jimmy says i can't interact with you.  jimmy: no, wait a minute, carl.  early protomammals were experts at survival.  maybe leppy can lead us to food and shelter.   i think he wants us to follow him.  no telling what this will do to the timeline, but it's our only chance.  come on, carl.  sheen: most dinosaurs think kids taste like chicken, but it's more of a pasty, livery flavor.  trust me, you'd hate it.  i love what you've done with the place.  ooh, guanonice touch.  hey, hey, wait.  where are you going.  don't leave me alone.  do you have any magazines..   hi, guys.  i'm a friend of your mom's.  nice lady.  look, i'm going to...  hey, hey, stay back.  don't mess with me.  i'm from the future.  no. aah.  no.  okay, just realign the quantum modulation, adjust for relativity displacement.  hey, jimmy.  still busy, huh.  almost there, carl.  how's your work coming.  well, me and leppy put a lot of thought into it, and i think we finally have something.  great.  show me what you've got.  okay.  on the downbeat.   now, when i first came to the cretaceous era    i experienced fright and terror    and then i met a friend who helped me to survive    his blood is warm    his young are born alive    hey, oh    aha    hey, hey, hey, oh.   jimmy: carl.  you were supposed to look for food and shelter.  we were, but then i started singing, and leppy picked up the steps so quickly.  never mind.  i'm almost finished constructing a duplicate quantum replay.  i have to complete the last circuit relay, and for that i'll need about four grams of pure diamond.  but, jimmy, jewelry stores won't be invented for several years.  that's why we need to search for deposits of alluvial sediment, where diamonds are usually found.  and i think that leppy can help us.  on a downbeat.  not by dancing calypso.  he can help by sniffing for a large sedimentary deposit.  do you think you can do it.  here's a small sample i found.  carl: he's good at sniffing.  how about it, lepster.  we need diamondsshiny things, a girl's best friend.   carl: i think it's working, jimmy.  i think he found the scent.  let's hope so.  come on.       aw, thanks for accepting me into your nest, guys.  i know it sounds all corny, but i never had brothers before.  i promise to be the best sibling ever.  hey, it's mom.  get out of my way.  feed me.  feed me.  what, no lizards..      okay... i really don't like where this is going.  wait. stop.  you call yourself a parent.  i want to live with dad.  no. no.   ooh.  ooh.  for the love of mike, mister.  when you signed up for parachute school, i assumed you'd use a parachute.  parachute..  i don't need no stinking parachute.  i'm hugh neutron, master of time and space.  cowabunga.   jimmy, i think my blood sugar is dangerously low.  we've been searching for hours.  maybe i overestimated leppy's intelligence.   alluvial sediment.  good going, leppy.  there's sure to be diamonds around here somewhere.  okay, let's lay out a grid search.  uh, mmy.  jimmy: holy heisenberg.  way to go, leppy.  it's enormous.  but how do i break off a small piece of incredibly hard diamond.  hey, i'm all over it, jim.  just sit back uh, carl, i don't think that a coconut...   relax, jimmy.  underneath this hefty exterior is a solid wall of muscle.    i need oxygen.  don't worry, carl.  i need to find something stronger than a coconut to strike the diamond with force.    leppy.  carl, no.     down, my brother, down.   flap.  flap for our lives.    there must be something i can do.  think.  think.  think.  yabbadabbadoo.  brain blast.  t. rex'sskull plate is as hard as steel.  with the right forward momentum, he can crack the diamond.    jimmy: hey, dorkasaurus.  over here.   if i can position myself just right...      we've got diamonds.  diamonds for everybody.  personally i prefer flowers and candy, but diamonds are nice.  the circuit's complete.  now we just need a few seconds for the unit to charge.    keep charging your thingy, jimmy.  i'll handle this.  hey.   hey, up here, ugly.  take that.   ha. got you, you smelly iguana.  jimmy, hurry.  just a few more seconds.   fastforward the volcano to a point in its future where it'll finally...   bye, my brothers.  good luck with evolving.  prepare for extreme quantum fastforward.   hi, sugarbooger.  remember how i promised i'd never be brought home by an angry mob again.  he disgusted all my customers, yeah.  he gave us brain freeze.  he made me experience the miracle of birth again and again and again.  yeah, yeah, birth.   all right, everyone.  i'll handle things from here.  somebody give me a ride home.  sugarbooger, i know it looks like i may have misused the power to control time and space for my own advantage, but on the positive side...  mmhmm.  ow. honey, that's my ear.  i use it to listen with.  ow.  jimmy, you did it.  we're home.  all right.   hey, boy, hi.   what a relief.  all the changes we made don't seem to have altered the timeline.  mom, dad, i'm back.  oh, no.  wedidalter the timeline.  we created a world where human males are slaves to a race of female warriors.  aah. oh, no.  have mercy, mighty overlords.  spare us, and we shall serve you well.  judy: sweetie, relax.  i just put your father in there to keep him from annoying the townspeople.  now, you were saying, hugh.  i'm sorry, honey.   i'm sorry, honey.   i'm sorry, honey.     i love the smell of banana in the morning.  go long, goddard.  whoa, dj vu.  captioning sponsored by the u.s. depar educaon in the kmart labor day sale.  find
