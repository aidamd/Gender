you guys all right.  just limbering up the old gi tract, jimbo.  it keeps your digestion loose and gas free.  come on, jimmy.  your intestines aren't going to unclench themselves, you know.  well, if you insist.   sounds like my men are hungry.  uh... what is this, mrs. wheezer.  fiber loaf  la kinga hypoallergenic protein substitute.  jimmy, the mrs. and i are allergic to most meat, fish, grain, dairy, fruit, vegetable and jalapeobased food products.  eat it, jimmy, before it gets damp.  well, um, mind salt.   jimmy, no.  that much airborne salt will set off our...   oh, sorry, jimmy.  more,

7:30.  jimmy, early to bed, early to rise, makes a man less prone to bronchial infection.  night, kids.  hey, jimmy, let's stay up all night and tell scary stories, and then we can share our most personal thoughts and not even go to sleep until...   okay, easy, jimmy.  it's only for the weekend.  you'll get through this.       this is ridiculous.  allergies, germs, constricted nighttime airways...  what's next..  do not fear.  only i can tame sancho, the wonder llama.  that's it.  i can't take it anymore.    it's late, but this is an emergency.    here we are, goddardtotal

ultrawheezers.  how cool is that.  we've got to go after them, sheen.  if my caplets wear off, they might hurt themselves.   jimmy: carl, be careful.  don't.  carl: geronimo.  chow down, son.  it's fabulous.  jimmy: listen, everybody, your new health is only temporary.  you need to be careful.  mmm, all the foods we could never eat beforepickles, cilantro, veal, hot salami, vichyssoisethat's

climbed mount incredibly unstable and lived.  i'm in.  me, too.   we've got to stop them before they get to mount incredibly unstable.  it's incredibly unstable.  how do you know this stuff.   yeah, this will really stick it to the man.  boogermama, need more wicker.   jimmy, i should tell you i usually barf around mach 2.  sorry, sheen, but my health caplets could wear off at any time.   ow. oh, that climb must have irritated my pinkeye.  okay, um, i think i got a nosebleed.  we're so terribly high up.  we could get exposure.  what were we thinking..  jimmy: no.  that rock's going to give.    ooh, that's harshing my mellow.  jimmy: it's headed right for the burning duck festival.  my mom and dad will be crushed.  just one chance.   i have to reverse the pull on my tractor beam.  i need more power.  it's not working.  wait a minutethat's it.  this desert is a salt flat.  sheen, help me get all this salty sand into the air.    hugh: out of sight.  you totally blew my mind, wheezers.  oh, are you all right, sweetie.  sure, mom, thanks to the wheezers.  oh, it was nothing.  say, does anyone have a moist towelette.  you cats have got to stick around.  we're just about to set fire to the big duck.  how about it, mr. wheezer.  we could give them a rousing bonfire song.  that we could, jimmy.  that we could.  all:  we're singing and standing    we're standing and singing    burning and singing    smoking and burning    singing and standing    standing and singing    burning and singing...   wow, cindy, our new kite is the most gorgeous thing in the sky.   it's also the most deadly.   the winner of the battle kite semifinal flyoffs is...  jimmy neutron.  ooh, yay.  neutrons rule.  whoopdewhoop. in your face.  man, that is one laserwhooped battle kite.  yes...  its jazzy design and bold use of color never stood a chance.  we'll get you next year, neutron.  and so, we move on to our final round: neutron versus retroville's richest kid, eustace stort.  that's "strych," you nattering nabob.  eustace strych.  oh... strych.  no one caresyet.  blix, prepare the buzzkill mark iv.  oh, give it up, neutron, the technology of this battle kite is the best oh, yeah.  well,

 and the winner is... jimmy neutron.   yeah. yeah.  nobody beats me.  nobody. nobody. nobody. nobody.  i'll make him pay for this indignity.  but how.  way to go, son.  you made your ancestors very proud.  eustace: yes, well done, jimmy.  well done indeed.  listen, why don't you and your "people" pop over to the compound for a celebratory flurp and ice cream banquet, hmm.  i think i'd rather gargle liquid nitrogen.  jimbo, that's rude.  now your ancestors are ashamed again.  jimmy, what are you thinking..  flurp, ice cream...  and flurp.  yeah, jim, don't make us put the hurt on you.  did someone say "banquet".  why, we'd be delighted to come, wouldn't we, libby.  indubitably.  someone with your looks and social standing must throw a lovely banquet.  way to suck up to the rich kid, vortex.  i don't care about his money.  we have a lot in commonhe dislikes you almost as much as i do.  of course you can come, my dear.   me likey.  what. okay, fine, i'll come, too.  is everybody happy now.  last one to the limo is middle class.   make the necessary preparations.  we'll need to entertain this rabble properly.  wow, this place is awesome.  eustace: it's nothing, really.  sorry about the heliport, we're having it redone.  wow, neutron, this sure beats the heck out of your dinky little clubhouse.  it's not "dinky," it's ergonomic.  oh, no, no, no, cindy, i'm sure that jimmy's clubhouse is stateoftheartprimitive art, that is.   oh, thank you so much.  he got you there, jimbo.   man: fore.  hey, son, haven't seen you in days.  who are your friends.  father, don't interfere.  hi, strych, hugh neutron.  glad to know you.  glad to knowyou.  say, you look like a golf man.  eh, nope, i'm more of a duck guy.  i love ducks.  ase get this banquet over with.  oh, don't mind us, son.  you run along with your friends and i'll show hubert here the vintage flurp cellar.  well, thanks, strych, old boy.  very well.  come, cindy, the monorail has arrived.  cindy: eustace, this is incredible.  there must be over 37 different flavors.  yeah, well, it's all right.  oh, don't be jealous, jimmy.  my ice cream is made from the purest iceage snow gathered via time box.  you've got one.  yesand you'd be surprised what money can buy.  oh, and check under your chairs, everyone.  my own holographic boy band.  a tacheon power glove just like ultralord's.  yes.  i got a miniature clone llama.  i'm going to call it "kevin." oh, eustace... it's beautiful.  it belonged to my grandmother.  i had it gutted to make it dvd compatible.  isn't he the dreamiest.  oh, come on, people, anyone can just buy stuff.  he doesn't even understand how these work.  quick poll: does anyone care.  nope.  no.  uhuh.  me neither.  why don't you check under your chair, jimmy.  used gym shorts.  my old spares.  thought your wardrobe needed touching up.  laugh with me, everyone, laugh with me.     whoo.   excuse me.  now, what you've got there is a '72 chateau la flurp.   ooh, that's good flurp.   you know, you got a great kid there, hugh.  thanks, strychy.  and eustace seems very ... clean.  oh, yes, he's, uh... he's, uh...  he's a rotten little tyrant and i'm an awful father.  oh, what do i do, hubert.  well, we find it helps to set limits, like no space travel on school nights, or, uh... no teleporting your mother.  and that works.  incredible.  tell me more about these "limits." eh, sure.   oh, that's good.   both: flurp.  everyone. i should like to propose a toast.  to jimmy, whose innuousness is exceeded only by his perspicacity.  i'm not sure what he said, but i bet it was insulting.    whoops, sorry.  so, we like games, eh, jimmy.  then let's have some gentlemen's fun, shall we.  make ready, neutron.  you're about to face the ultimate triumph in expensive robot technology.  blix, bring out the r.a. multiunit.   ah, it's adorable.  they just don't make crazed, berserk robots like they used to.  scan that thing, goddard.  hmm, it seems pretty low tech.  sorry, eustace, my robot technology is parsecs ahead of your socalled "ultimate triumph." really.  then how about a friendly wager.  your robot dog against my r.a. unit.  now, if your pooch loses...  i get to keep him.  not going to happen, captain overbite.  ha. i told you he was chicken.  come, cindy, join me in mocking him.  you know you want to.   oh, it's so much fun.  sure... i... i guess i do.   you're on, strych.   don't worry, boy, you'll beat him easy.  let the game begin.  jimmy, you sure you know what you're doing.   sheen: hey.  it's growing a particle thingy just like goddard.   it... it's impossible.  unless... "r.a. unit"...  "robot adaptoid".  eustace: that's right, jimmy.  my adaptoid can copy any weapon and hurl its power back tenfold.  run, goddard.  run, boy.  eustace, stop.  you can't do this.  be gone.  i've no further use for neutron's squeeze.    jimmy: goddard.   goddard.  goddard.  just one chancehe copies every move we make.  play dead, boy.  eustace: haha. i win.  i've beaten you.  you'd think so, wouldn't you.  take cover.  good boy.   jimmy: what's wrong, eustace.  can't your unit spontaneously reassemble after a main core implosion. no.  too bad, old bean.   carl: that a boy, jimmy.  no. no. no. no.  for this, neutron, i will pursue you with everlasting vengeance.  mr. strych: not so fast, young man.  it's time we set some "limits." to start with, no pursuing anyone with eternal vengeance for an entire month.  like that, hugh.  uh... close enough.  i warned you not to interfere, father.  now you'll pay.  uhoh, that's a time out.  right.  blix, take eustace to his room so he can, uh... think about what he's done.  what. don't.  unhand me, you filthy...   confidence rising.  parental power coursing through my veins.  oh, the indignity.  don't look at me.  don't look at me.   sorry, goddard, i never should have bet you.   well, i'll tell you one thing i learned:  yes, dad.  no, that was it.
