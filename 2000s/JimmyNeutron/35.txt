  oh, we're thrilled you got the job at the toy company, honey.  you've got to come up with a new toy design every day.  yes, sirree, and they want each toy to do cool, hightech stuff just like baby quackers.  well, better get crackin' on some new design.  we're doomed.  don't worry, mom.  i think i can soup up dad's toy designs day after day after day...  at least until i go away to college.  i'll bring your meals to your clubhouse.            hmm, well, this circuit board should give the toy stateoftheart transforming abilities.  how's the candy ammunition coming, goddard.     this is the fifth invention this week.  maybe if i rest my head for just a minute.    hugh: uh, pudding pants, have you seen the malibu death machine i invented.  i left it right here on the kitchen table.  oh, i think jimmy is in his clubhouse working on it, i mean, shining it.   jimbo, are you in there.  open up, son.  i need my toy.  huh. carl, sheen, come on in.   whoa.  groovy.  jimbo added an underground disco to the clubhouse.   oh, isn't that cute.  he had so much fun playing with my new malibu death machine he's all tuckered out.  oh, needs batteries.  there must be some batteries around here.  oh, the creator's father seeks a portable power source.  in here.  hello, hello, funny man.  hey, little bitty talking batteriesthat's even better.  come here.  both: we're back again, baby.  we owe our freedom to the creator's father.  we must find a way to thank him.  the meat of the month club is always nice.  fool, he's a vegetarian.  then he can regift.  done.  gentlemen, the malibu death machine will be the biggest toy ever.  the boys will love its massive firepower while the girls love its bouncing and behaving hair.  what about duck lovers.  i used duck grease to lube the fuselage.  all righty, get ready for the most fun toy in the world.    neutron, is this a joke.  no, no, no, i could've just sworn i...  neutron.  something is distressing the creator's father.  i won't let you blow our chance at freedom.  let us review his commands.  he wanted us to be the biggest toy ever.  one of these commands says "super size." hit it.   no. down... down, boy.  i am not happy about this one little bit.  the creator's father is still not pleased.  he also said our housing unit would yield a high degree of fun.  let us achieve fun.   listen to their squeals of merriment.  yes, we are beloved by children of all ages.  engaging flaming licorice bazooka.    ow.      switching to rocketpropelled candycane launcher.  aim for their funny bones.     : got to modify dad's new toy before...  where's the toy i was working on.   where are the nanobots..    goddard, we've got to stop those nanobots before they destroy the whole town.  but how.  think... think.    got to go potty.  brain blast.  i should be able to use the baby quacker's remote to control the malibu death machine.   it looks like the end for ultralord, unless his trusty sidekick dr. science saves him with some cool gadget.  superkabobee have cool gadget.  behold the lint brush of doom.  okay, this is really lame.  i know. if jimmy were here we would've fallen out of the sky two or three times by now.  superkabobee has saved the day.    what is wrong with my new friends.  you want to play with the lint brush.  no, dude, turn around.     this is a job for superkabobee's mighty skewers of justice.    jimmy, what are you doing here.  the nanobots got inside one of my dad's toys and now the entire town is about to be destroyed.  yeah, that's what i'm talking about.  go, jimmy. go, jimmy.  do you want us to help you save the town for oldtime's sake.  it might put your lives in terrible danger.  both: we'll do it.  jimmy: a little to the left.  a little more.  perfectstay right in its path.  don't move until i say so.  carl, we're about to be totally obliterated by a monster girl tank.  it's great to have jimmy back.  isn't it, though.  i've got to lock on to the tank's radio frequency.  come on, come on.  the creator and his colleagues appear highly stressed.  we better level both barrels of fun at them.  jimmy: almost there.  almost... got it.   you strange...  remote manipulation.  can't resist saying...  nanobots: "got to go potty." mote's commands.   all tanks have flood capacity.  try to hold it in.   i... can't.   nanobot: oopsy.     huh..  oh, no.   good job, jimmy.  you saved the town but still caused mondodestruction.  oh, nice going, bladder boy.  i knew we should've gone before we left the office.  i am terribly uncomfortable.  would you change me.  yes, i'll start with the shape of your head.  ow. you have anger issues.  yeah, this is helping.  ow. ow. ow.  so i guess since your dad's toy company is toast you're going to have to move after all, huh.  yeah, i guess so.  friendship is a cruel mistress.  hugh: hi, boys.  you're just in time for the celebration.  the celebration.  yes, your father got a promotion.  you mean you didn't lose your job.  nope, the malibu death machine was a publicrelations bonanza.  we made all the papers.  then we don't have to move.  well, actually, the company wants to send me to their headquarters in new york city.  but i turned them down.  dad, what'll you do for a job.  well, since practically everyone's car was trashed in the rampage, mallard motors is reopening its doors.  the neutrons are staying right here where we belong.   and so the world won't have to wait for the further adventures of ultralord...  and the tofunator.  don't forget dr. science.  all right. yeah.   and superkabobee.   danimals crush cups. check it out.  i crush the alien.  ..  i crush the tikki.  i crush a danimals crush cup.  huh. yea, danimals crush cups.  you crush it and slurp it.  mmm. cool.  no spoon.  nope,
