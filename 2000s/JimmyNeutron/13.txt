 that's not true, you have...  getting it off.  in the meantime, i'll help you blend into society.  like so.  sheen: oh.  how's that gettingitoff thing coming.  this should do the trick.  all right, it worked.  wow.  thanks, jim.  whew, that was a close one.  i could use a stiff shake at the candy bar.  mmm, sounds good.  but you know what i really feel like.   jimmy: carl, what are you eating.  well, i got this sudden craving for a bowl of ice cream, jalapeos, dill pickles, strawberries, salmon and lard.  yuck. strawberries.  why are you both staring at me.  do i look fat to you.  no, no.  it just seems un... unhealthy.  : i've always been on the heavy side : but i think i'm jolly.  : you shouldn't talk, big head.  : but we are what we are and that's fine with me.  that is the single coolest thing i have ever seen.  back to the lab.  do it again, carl.  back to the lab.  all right. you don't have to yell.  it's just what i thought: the strange appetite, the mood swings, the glowing bulges.  carl, i don't know how to say this, so i'll whisper it to sheen and he'll blurt it out.  carl is pregnant.  what.  well, sort of.  it's a living mass of energy growing inside you, placed there by the alien that was on your face.  it happens all the time.  but i can't support an alien child.  i don't even have a job.  will you guys excuse me.  i need time to think.  this is so cool.  carl, when the alien is old enough, can i take it on a rampage of wanton destruction.  if you're both back before dark.  man. you already talk like a parent.  chile pancake.  clam ball.  pork brownie.  jimmy: good news, carl.  i know how to solve this without harming either of you.  why are you nodding no.  i've thought about it, jim.  if it's a boy, i'll name him schmengel and if it's a girl, schmengetta.  i want it to retain its alien heritage.  what..  yes. i'm going to be an uncle.  is there an alien uncle's day.   mr. wheezer, hi. is carl...  dead. no, he's here.  we're preparing for the pitterpatter of little, uh...  whatever the alien's mode of locomotion will be.  hi, jimmy.  carl, this is insane.  you need to come to the lab for tests immediately.  hello, jimmy.  isn't this exciting.  we've always wand grandkids.  oh, we sure have.  even if it's not so much a kid as a sizzling mass of alien energy.     uh, jimmy, does that little spark there mean it's a boy alien.  i don't know.  carl, aren't you worried.  this thing might feed off your insides or electrocute you or grow until it splits you in half.  yeah, kids can be a handful.  hmm, this magnascope should be linking with the alien's energy, but there's interference.  : is that a fat joke.  : because if so, it's pretty funny...  : and very hurtful.  oop, got to go.  the girls are throwing me a baby shower.  byebye.  and stop looking at my calves.   carl: oh, a jumper with six legs.   huh, is that cute or what.  we also got the 20leg expansion pack in case it's born with more.  if it's a legless mass of energy, i saved the receipt.  oh, thanks, gals.  i should have been implanted with an alien growth long ago.  okay, game time.  first we're going to play diaperbabyarounditstail.   it may not have a tail, itan't hurt to practice.  carl, i've got the magnascope to link with the alien with no harm to it or you.  um, thanks, jimmy, but i'm in midshower.  carl, you're in danger, and the last thing you need is to be fawned over by a bunch of girls.  who wants clotted cream with their scones.  uh... this is much more masculine than it looks.  nerdtron, you're not an authority on babies just because you are one.  sorry, i'm trying to prevent my friend from becoming a smoldering pile of slag.  would you pass the scones.  why, i'd be delighted.  fine.  if you need help sweeping up carl's ashes, i'll be iny b.  boy, he's in a bad mood, huh.  he's just jealous because i'm getting all the attention.  what other games do you have.  hey, what's up with the lights.  sheen: hey, jimmy, wait up.  holy herculaneum.  it's made of the same energy as the thing inside carl.  no. the alien monsters have come to punish us for invading their planet.  a plan i was against, by the way.  jimmy: no, it's looking for something.  unless i miss my guess, that's the mom of the alien in carl, come to claim her baby.  whoa.  get the girls out of the house, but keep carl safe inside.  got it: girls out, carl safe.  this electricity bill is outrageous and i won't pay it.  ooh, i didn't know you were so strapped for cash.  will you take a check.  my counselor was right.  all i needed to curb my anger was a hobby.   okay, now i'm mad.  it's headed right for carl.  if it only reduces him to smoldering slag, he'll be lucky.  bye, see ya.  thanks for coming.  but this ismyhouse.  don't be selfish, get out.  sheen, what's going on.  uh... it's time for your breathing exercises.  first you fill up your "diaphragum," then you empty your "diaphragum." soothing, isn't it.  well, i guess...  : soothing, isn't it.  yeah, yeah, it's very soothing.  that's it, come on.  it's working.   and now it's time for calming visualization.  picture a gentle lake nestled among the mountains.  the water is placid.  but what's that.  something's in the lake.  it's the legendary hokeypokey monster.  his gaze withers crops and turns soda to bleach.  run.  run from the hokeypokey.  save your soda. save yourself.   it's time.  come on, just a little closer.  stop, jimmy.  carl. carl, get back.  don't hurt her.  i know what she wants.  bye, schmengo.  i'll miss you.  carl, that hug contained 10,000 volts of energy.  wasn't it painful.  saying goodbye to your kids is always painful, jimmy.  hey, it looks the same as a month ago.  don't desolate planets ever change.  come on, guys.   boys: happy birthday, schmengo.  hey, don't i get a hug.  don't forget your uncle jimmy.  uh, no, really, it's okay.  aah. get away from me.  carl.  want some cake.  yeah, a corner piece, please.  jimmy: i'm not kidding.  jimmy: you're in big trouble.  jimmy: happy birthday, greataunt amanda.  you're looking more beautiful and less wrinkly every year.  no thanks to you.  your gadgets and gewgaws have taken years off my life.  but, aunt amanda, jimmy's gadgets have saved the town dozens of times.  sure. after he brought down a giant meteor to destroy us all.  or those evil aliens.  or pants.  horrible walking pants.  which cousin are you again.  now, now, newt, kari, cousin gomer, cousin annabelle...   and little eddielet's not fight.  we've gathered together because we love our dear aunt amanda and not because her fabulous wealth controls our very destiny.  yeah, can't we all just get along.  no.  because of you, the neutron name isn't respectable anymore.  why can't you be nice like your friends.  mmm, i've been waiting all year to eat aunt kari's salt paddies.  and this year's 147bean salad is the best one yet.  oh, hugh, maybe we should just go.  no, no, i think i've found a way to win aunt amanda over.  say, aunt amanda, you haven't unwrapped my present yet.  : huh, so i haven't.  why, it's a barbecue spatula.  i know how much you love to barbecue.  that baby's got 17 electrohydraulic attachments and a back scratcher.   i also brought a little something for everyone.  who wants a cybernetic palm pager.   well, jimmy, this is very thoughtful.  it's too bad your dear old granny couldn't be here to see this.  but she's in reno, kicking butt at the slots.   aunt amanda, may i freshen your cider.   if only that highpitched whining wasn't giving me a migraine.  highpitched wining.  oh, no.  aunt amanda, look out.  uh, i don't know.  steve, i'm frightened.  well, don't panic, it's probably nothing.  hhey. what's happening.  steve, where are you.  hoy. steve.  no. stay back.    announcer: they were never seen again.  had the bahama quadrangle taken two more victims into its watery clutches.  cool.  spooky.  oh, what a bunch of baloney.  you don't believe the bahama quadrangle is haunted, do you.  how else do you explain all the boats and planes that went missing there.  it could be anythingsudden tornadoes, freak electrical storms...  ghosts of the undead hoarding human flesh to feed their ravenous hunger.  sheen, do you even believe half the stuff you say.  yes.  or do i.  well, have you ever been there, jimmy.  no, but i've read all about it.  it's where one of my favorite scientists, used to conduct his groundbreaking oceanographic research.  carl: used to.  what happened to him.  he went missing.  aha.  that's just a coincidence.  it's sorcery, i tells you.  or evil porpoises.  or fishheaded octomen.  get up.  where we going.  to the bahama quadrangle, so i can prove that this "mystery" is perfectly explainable.  mmm... nah.  i'll pass.  fine, then we'll start our essays on the habsburg empire.  quadrangle it is.  right behind you, captain.  sheen: are we there yet.  how about now.  are we there now.  how about now.  carl: i hope it's soon.  i need to ethe ttle boys' ocean.  according to the neutronic positioning unit, we're now entering the bahama quadrangle.  notice the complete lack of anything creepy...   until now.  uh, jimmy, flying into a fog bank on a perfectly sunny day is normal, right.  of course it is.  happens all the time, right, jimmy.  actually...  we're doomed.  we're not doomed.  the only thing to fear is total engine failure.   now we're doomed.    guys, there's somethinsh going on here.  fishy. as in evil porpoises.  well, this was fun.  let's go home.  carl, we need to go underwater and investigate.  everyone take some airgum.   okay, now if we get lost, let's meet back here so we don't...  : wait f me.  jimmy was rightnothing mysterious here.  bye.  that's strange.  i'm picking up humanoidbisigns om that direction.  follow me.  sheen: can't we just take a moment to appreciate this.  we're young, we're in the bahamas, we've got our whole lives ahead of us.  perhaps i spoke too soon.  jimmy, what's happening.  i don't know.  can't... fight... current.  too strong.   this place has seen the last of my tourist dollars.   all right, evil porpoise, i don't like you and you don't like me, so...   yike.     goodbye, world.  the horror.  so, where are we anyway.  seaweed.  it looks like we've been sucked into some sort of kelp processing plant.  man: bravo.  excellent deduction.  hey, jimmy, isn't that...  dr. sydney moist, the world's leading researcher in the field of phytochemical compounds.  and a deliciously graceful tap dancer.  : pah, pah, pah, pah, pah.  yeah.  but you were reported dead years ago.  oh, i can assure you i'm quite alivemarvelously, resplendently alive.  and charleston.  huh.   hey, jimmy, you didn't tell us dr. moist was completely out of his...  ah, my apologies for sucking you into my lab.  the ocean is full of spies.  but enough jibberjabberwho's hungry, hmm.  nipsey, russell.   sheen: oh, look.  dr. nutjob has some slimy green friends.  moist: show our guests to the table.  i hope you boys are hungry.  incredible.  they're type of planktohumanoid life forms.  moist: i decided to make men out of algae.  i call them... "algaemen".  and i thought he was insane.  well, eat up, there's plenty for everyone.  : mmm.  it's scrumptious.   yum, yum.  : yeah, that really hits the spot.   why live underwater when you could share with other scientists.  ha.  never.  they all laughed at me and called me "dr.  loonypants." well, who's laughing now, hmm.  who's crazy now..   i'll go check on dessert.  guys, what'd i tell you.  there's nothing mysterious about the bahama quadrangle.  oh, no.  we're having dinner atg4qqdrhe ocean with a crazy lunatic and his seaweed friends.  okay, granted, he's a little eccentric...  a little eccentric..  the guy's crazier than a sackful of spider monkeys.  so, how are we doing, hmm.  dr. moist, can you explain to my friends here that there's nothing mysterious about the bahama quadrangle.  i'd be happy to...  right after your transformation.   transformation.  into algaemen, just like all the other fools who've passed this way to spy on me.  huh.  that's rightyour food was chockfull of mutant algae seeds.  huh.  which even as we speak are infusing your every cell with kelpy goodness.  huh.  guys, i'm turning green.  but you ate it, toowe saw you.  yes, but i have the antidote.   ah, that isgoodantidote.   you're insane.  oh, gee, you think.  what was your first clue.  seize them.   so, dr. moist kidnaps anyone in the bahama quadrangle and turns them into algaebased manservants.  i told you it wasn't anything supernatural.  gee, you were right, jimmy.  i'd congratulate you if i weren't being turned into a 85pound walking salad.  oh, i don't know, maybe being algae isn't so bad.  i mean, all we have to do is keep our coats moist and slimy.  and be butlers to a taphappy mental case.  oh, right.  that's it.  what's it.  every room in the lab is kept humid so the algaemen can thrive.  so.  so watch.    it's working.    now we get his keys.   i knew a young lady named eloise crocker    whose beauty could knock a man right off his rocker    now, don't get me wrong, i don't want to knock her    but she stank like the sweat socks in davy jones' locker.    guys, you distract the algaemen while i go for the antidote.  right.  shall we.  do let's.  step right up, fellas.  find the pretty lady.  that's rightfind the pretty lady.  nobody goes home a loser.    an electricalvectors entry.  i expected more from dr. moist.   or not.   carl: that's rightup and down and all around.  find the pretty lady.  oh. tough luck, chief.    carl, sheencatch.  oh, wait, this isn't high in sodium, is it.  because i'm not supposed...   carl: yay, i'm pasty again.   you'll never escape.  my algaemen will get you.  i'd like to see them try.  yeah.  you would.  crush them.   guys, chew as much airgum as you can.  sorry, it's my breath, isn't it.  no, carl, algae thrives on co2.  there's enough in this gum to cause the algaemen to grow exponentially.  and how is that good again.  jimmy: no time to explain.  chew for your lives.  quick, guys, follow me.    stop. what are you doing.  stop growing this instant.  don't make me do my angry dance.  no.   swim. hurry.      we did it.  dr. moist's reign of terror is over.  the mystery of the bahama quadrangle is solved.  i'm just glad it wasn't evil porpoises.  that would have been terrifying.  oh, not again with the fog.   jimmy: uh, guys.  what say we let this mystery slide.     can you turn off the music.  sorry.  jimmy: notice themiscellana octoria's distinctive tibial spurs and sclerotized pedipalps.  fascinating.  can you make it do the hokeypokey.  sheen, go home.  guys. guys. guys.  i've got a girlfriend.  huh.  who is she.  well, she's my pen pal from sweden and she's coming to retroville and her name is elke ekberg.  that was weird.  i thought i heard carl say he had a girlfriend.  i do.  here's her picture.   she's a teen model, tennis star, gymnast, masseuse and ballet dancer.  don't take this the wrong way, carl, but you're kind of a nerd.  what does she see in you.  well, i sent her some pictures.  sheen: man...  where was i when you did all this stuff.  carl, these are all pictures of me.  i didn't think she'd like a hefty boy with glasses who's into llamas and sleeps with a blanky and has unsightly spots all over his...  too much information.  so i told her i was a boy genius and i invented cool stuff and had a neat lab.  so you said you were me.  huh. oh, yeah, kind of.  anyway, elke has a oneday stopover in retroville on her way to a tennis tournament, and i'm afraid when she sees me, she'll find out i've been lying to her.  because you have.  huh. oh, yeah, kind of.  and then she won't like me anymore.  and by you, you mean me.  huh. oh, yeah, kind of.  if you're looking for help, count me out.  come on, jimmy, just let carl pretend to be you.  he could show her some inventions, fly her in the hover car, and she'll never know.  i'm not letting carl touch my stuff.  oh, please, jimmy.  this may be my only chance to impress a tennisplaying, teenmodeling, balletdancing, gymnasticking masseuse.  yeah, come on, jimmy.  okay, for one day only you can be carl wheezer, boy genius.  yay, thanks, jim.  you're the best friend in the whole world.  oh, by the way, i told her you're my dimwitted assistant.  what..  i said you were an experiment that went rribly wrong.  sweet.  you think i should put on something nice to meet her.  : like a mask.  carl, what you need is a total makeover from nerd guy to science guy.   carl: there she is.  : elke...  ja.  carl wheezer.  hi, i'm, um...  my dimwitted assistant.  take elke's bag, and be quick.  i'm sheen.  he really used to be a monkey.  monkey. what kindflying monkey, squirrel monkey, a chunky, funky monkey.  ooh, i love your car which hovers.  yeah, well, it's just a little something i threw together one afternoon.  aprs vous.  oh, that's french for "get in." okay, uh...  go ahead, boy genius, start her up.  carl: hmm, let's see...  i'll, uh, maybe...  may i suggest that instead of the armmissiles button, you push the one right below it.  i know what button to push.  i was just testing you.  i'm teaching him how to drive.  yeah, i'll teach you how to...  okay, monkey boy says, "let's get this show on the road."  it is so nice to finally meet you in the person.  you are such the genius.   his name was rico    he was a showboy...    uh, dimwitted assistant, remember what i
