 fine. first admit that i'm a smarter, nicer allaround better person than you.  forget it.  attention, giant squid.  we mean you no harm.  it's all jimmy's fault.   it's not working, cindy.  uh, can't we just let jimmy out.  but... i...  oh, all right.  say the magic words.  jimmy neutron is a smarter, nicer allaround better person than i am.   now that wasn't so hard, was it.  hurry, jimmy.  do something.  hmm, the gill gab seems functional.  why isn't it working.  whoa. hurry, jimmy.  quick, carl, throw me your bag of fish snack 'ems.  just as i thought.  freezedried squid.  aha.  i don't get it.  don't you see.  the squid can't understand us because the gill gab only works on fish.  but if i put squid dna from carl's snack on the gill gab's microchip maybe we can communicate with him.  aha.  i don't get it.  jimmy: attention, squid, we come in peace.  : i say, who said that.  we mean no harm.  we just came for the treasure chest inside the boat.  that piece of rubbish.  why didn't you say so.  and to think i was about to crush your heads and suck out your guts.   oh, dear.  there you are.  both: you did it, jimmy.  and don't worry.  despite your mutinous behavior you'll all still get a cut of the treasure.  miss fowl: this is the most delicious salt water taffy i've ever tasted, children.  your project gets an "aplus".   you know, jimmy, i hear each one of these pieces of taffy is worth over three cents.  i don't want to talk about it.  o ooo jimmy: now, carl. now.  oh, why doesn't he push the button.  hey, jimmy.  i was having an argument with my stupid little sister.  is the potty fairy real.  the potty fairy.   of course not.  then who have i been aiming at all these years.  i'll ask carl.  he's more worldly.    carl, what happened.  you were supposed to deploy the antigravity parachute at 5,000 feet.  uh, sorry there, jimmy.  i guess i fell asleep again.  well, your lack of focus is interfering with science.   honey...  i'm going to the supermarket and your dad's coming along to eat the loose grapes from the spill gutter around the produce bin.  eat grapygrape grapes.  got to get them before they turn into raisins because after that...  that's it. food.  you just haven't catalyzed enough hydrocarbons into c02, water and energy this morning.  huh.  you're hungry.   sheen: hey, jimmy, you were right about the potty fairy.  but surely you must believe in the garbage disposal bunny. no.  carl, i have a few more experiments you're going to have to be wide awake for so eat the rest of...  carl.  you obviously need more food.  well, till your parents get back all you've got is lima beans.  : i hate lima beans.  and i'm not hungry, jimmy.  i'm tired, 'cause of...  the nightmare.   it's awful.  a horrible, spooky thing's chasing me.  and i run and i run, but i can't get away.  you should do what i do during a nightmare.  simply prove, on paperusing noneuclidean geometrythat the feared object is a logical impossibility and it vanishes.  yeah, but my dreams aren't as logical as yours, jimmy.  i married a turkey once.  plus, when i'm asleep you're not there to explain things.  true.  wait, just a neutronic minute.  thanks to my most recent invention, i can be.   i call it the dream injector 5,000.  it's revolutionary.  and it's safe.  : are you sure.  carl, i'm going to project your dream into thesomnusportal then walk through and up this tube and into your nightmare.  is it going to hurt.  no, huhuh.  i'll be fine.  now, uh, go to sleep.  well, i can't just go to sleep.  why not.  um, 'cause i have a soothing routine.  first, my mom turns down the light.  vox, lights.  then... ... she makes me hot milk.  oh, for crying in mud.  goddard.  anything else.  both:  nony, nony, nony.     carl oh, no.  i'm in my underwear at the mall.  jimmy: he's asleep.  if i'm not out of his dream in an hour wake him up.  rodgerdodger.    nony, non...   : good night, moon.   it works.  i'm inside carl's dream.  libby: sorry i'm late.  my paddle broke, so i had to row my desk to school with this plastic leg.  quiet.  the great, merciful and powerfullychinned carl is about to speak... ... speak.  thank you, winifred.  this is my revolutionary voltage pandolizer.  i converted the hoskibobits to the flutch by putting it through the hoobaboobler.  ooh, wow. ooh... wow.  when carl's asleep he dreams he's a genius, like me.  like you.. please.  you can't even spell your own name.  now, i'll need a dumb, but willing, volunteer.  but i'm not dumb.  i'm a genius.   : if you're so smart what's the square root of a flexnard, huh.  well, that doesn't make any sense.  the square root of a flexnard is a cup full of boogers.  he did that all in his head.  come on, carl.  we don't have time for this.  we've got work to do.   i will now turn on the really smart experiment machine.  you wired that coil wrong.  all this will do is give me 10,000 volts whichsince this is a dreami won't actually...   kids: ooh...  oh, no.  whatever carl dreams actually happens to me.  sheen. sheen.  wake him up.   jimmy: sheen.  sheen.  okay, enough.  carl, you're asleep.  this is a dream.  : don't be silly.  if it was a dream, could i do this.  that's the only time youcando it.  carl... you're asleep.  there are llamas in the classroom.  libby rode to school with a plastic leg.  her paddle broke.  we don't have time for this.   hehe touched his astounded carlness.  send him to the ultra principal.    what are you doing.   for behold i am the ultra principal.  no, you're not.  you're a friend of mine inside a dream another friend of mine's having.  hah. and again, hah.  if i was a mere dream, could i do this.  that's carl's brain.  is not.  : i am the brain of the ultra principal dispenser of justice throughout the universe.  okay. what am i here for.  you've insulted carl the smartest and handsomest student in all the land.  i sentence you to be his monkey boy for a mmillion years.  with the duty of testing his inventions and fashioning festive doily hats for him to wear.  i'm not going to agree to that.  you already signed your nameincorrectly, by the wayon this binding monkey boy contract.  hah. that's not my signature.  huh.   they're free gutter grapes that would only spoil otherwise your magnificent geniousness.   hey, mom and dad, look.  it's my personal monkey boy.  hey, ththose aren't your parents.  they're mine.   don't be silly, young man.  i would never have a child as dimwitted as you.  plus, if it was a dream, could i do this.   ew, hugh, you're brain's all wet and stretchy.  : that's my tongue.  let go. i've got to taste pie with that.   carl, listen to me.  i'm only here to help you vanquish the horrible spooky thing.    who told monkey boy about the spspspooky thing.   this is hopeless.  wait a minute.  if he won't listen to real logic maybe i should try dream logic.  worth a try.  you told me about the spooky thing oh, brilliant, handsome carl while you were apeddling a bike with no wheels backwards, up the pyramids, um, in a ballerina's tutu.  oh, yeah.  i remember that.  butbut evenyouprobably aren't smart enough to know where it lives.  oh, no.  for your information, it's...  : under there.  that's what you're scared of.   a stupid lima bean.  i know you hate 'em, carl, but they're not scary.      look, carl, wake up.  that thing can really eat me.  i'm not asleep.  yes, you are.  and we're going to prove it mathematically using the riemann hypothesis.  : write this down.  all of nontrivial zeroes of the zeta function have real part equal to onehalf...  okay, but my pen just turned into a worm.    oh, hi, honey.  i brought you dinner.    genius won't help me here.  i need to show carl something so outrageous he'll realize the only explanation is he's asleep.  but what..  ii washed your brain.  but i had trouble getting the think stains out.  that's it.  jimmy kissing cindy.  oh, that couldn't happen in a million years.   i must be dreaming.   oh, wow, i had the craziest dream.   i know, i was there.  you almost got me killed by a legume.   sheen, don't move.  there's a giant maneating lima bean behind you.  hah. you guys.  i haven't believed in that since i was, like, seven.      jimmy: luckily, as all bean farmers know phaseolus limensis perishes when exposed to dry air and overly nitrogenous soil.  but you hit it with a hammer.  come on, honey, right this way.   it's okay.  : your father got overexcited and ate abolt that fell off a grocery cart.  it was grapeshaped. yes.  uh, hey, carl, you won't tell anyone about that awful, desperate thing i had to do to wake you up, will ya.  of course not, jimmy.   not even inhisdreams, neutron.    x(] (] (] (] (] (](] m0x m0x mx mxx mxx m x m x m x m x m x m0j x m0j x m0j

song    for jimmy neutron.      captoredby nickelodeon check it out.  i'm a speed demon.  you getting this, baby.  woman: sure am, honey.  whoohoo.  announcer: you're watching vacation footage of steve and jenny bissell, who set out for paradise but sailed smackdab into the mystery of the bahama quadrangle.  uh, honey, what's the deal with this fog.  uh, i don't know.  steve, i'm frightened.  well, don't panic, it's probably nothing.  hhey. what's happening.  steve, where are you.  honey. steve.  no. stay back.    announcer: they were never seen again.  had the bahama quadrangle taken two more victims into its watery clutches.  cool.  spooky.  oh, what a bunch of baloney.  you don't believe the bahama quadrangle is haunted, do you.  how else do you explain all the boats and planes that went missing there.  it could be anythingsudden tornadoes, freak electrical storms...  ghosts of the undead hoarding human flesh to feed their ravenous hunger.  sheen, do you even believe half the stuff you say.  yes.  or do i.  well, have you ever been there, jimmy.  no, but i've read all about it.  it's where one of my favorite scientists, dr. sydney moist, used to conduct his groundbreaking oceanographic research.  carl: used to.  what happened to him.  he went missing.  aha.  that's just a coincidence.  it's sorcery, i tells you.  or evil porpoises.  or fishheaded octomen.  get up.  where we going.  to the bahama quadrangle, so i can prove that this "mystery" is perfectly explainable.  mmm... nah.  i'll pass.  fine, then we'll start our essays on the habsburg empire.  quadrangle it is.  right behind you, captain.  sheen: are we there yet.  how about now.  are we there now.  how about now.  carl: i hope it's soon.  i need to use the little boys' ocean.  according to the neutronic positioning unit, we're now entering the bahama quadrangle.  notice the complete lack of anything creepy...   until now.  uh, jimmy, flying into a fog bank on a perfectly sunny day is normal, right.  of course it is.  happens all the time, right, jimmy.  actually...  we're doomed.  we're not doomed.  the only thing to fear is total engine failure.   now we're doomed.    guys, there's something fishy going on here.  fishy. as in evil porpoises.  well, this was fun.  let's go home.  carl, we need to go underwater and investigate.  everyone take some airgum.   okay, now if we get lost, let's meet back here so we don't...  : wait for me.  jimmy was rightnothing mysterious here.  bye.  that's strange.  i'm picking up humanoid biosigns from that direction.  follow me.  sheen: can't we just take a moment to appreciate this.  we're young, we're in the bahamas, we've got our whole lives ahead of us.  perhaps i spoke too soon.  jimmy, what's happening.  i don't know.  can't... fight... current.  too strong.   this place has seen the last of my tourist dollars.   all right, evil porpoise, i don't like you and you don't like me, so...   yike.     goodbye, world.  the horror.  so, where are we anyway.  seaweed.  it looks like we've been sucked into some sort of kelp processing plant.  man: bravo.  excellent deduction.  hey, jimmy, isn't that...  dr. sydney moist, the world's leading researcher in the field of phytochemical compounds.  and a deliciously graceful tap dancer.  : pah, pah, pah, pah, pah.  yeah.  but you were reported dead years ago.  oh, i can assure you i'm quite alivemarvelously, resplendently alive.  and charleston.  huh.   hey, jimmy, you didn't tell us dr. moist was completely out of his...  ah, my apologies for sucking you into my lab.  the ocean is full of spies.  but enough jibberjabberwho's hungry, hmm.  nipsey, russell.   sheen: oh, look.  dr. nutjob has some slimy green friends.  moist: show our guests to the table.  i hope you boys are hungry.  incredible.  they're some type of planktohumanoid life forms.  moist: i decided to make men out of algae.  i call them... "algaemen".  and i thought he was insane.  well, eat up, there's plenty for everyone.  : mmm.  it's scrumptious.   yum, yum.  : yeah, that really hits the spot.   why live underwater when you could share with other scientists.  ha.  never.  they all laughed at me and called me "dr.  loonypants." well, who's laughing now, hmm.  who's crazy now..   i'll go check on dessert.  guys, what'd i tell you.  there's nothing mysterious about the bahama quadrangle.  oh, no.  we're having dinner at the bottom of the ocean with a crazy lunatic and his seaweed friends.  okay, granted, he's a little eccentric...  a little eccentric..  the guy's crazier than a sackful of spider monkeys.  so, how are we doing, hmm.  dr. moist, can you explain to my friends here that there's nothing mysterious about the bahama quadrangle.  i'd be happy to...  right after your transformation.   transformation.  into algaemen, just like all the other fools who've passed this way to spy on me.  huh.  that's rightyour food was chockfull of mutant algae seeds.  huh.  which even as we speak are infusing your every cell with kelpy goodness.  huh.  guys, i'm turning green.  but you ate it, toowe saw you.  yes, but i have the antidote.   ah, that isgoodantidote.   you're insane.  oh, gee, you think.  what was your first clue.  seize them.   so, dr. moist kidnaps anyone in the bahama quadrangle and turns them into algaebased manservants.  i told you it wasn't anything supernatural.  gee, you were right, jimmy.  i'd congratulate you if i weren't being turned into a 85pound walking salad.  oh, i don't know, maybe being algae isn't so bad.  i mean, all we have to do is keep our coats moist and slimy.  and be butlers to a taphappy mental case.  oh, right.  that's it.  what's it.  every room in the lab is kept humid so the algaemen can thrive.  so.  so watch.    it's working.    )
