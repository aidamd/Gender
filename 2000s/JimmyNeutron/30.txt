chewy crust and real butter on the top...  you think smithee knows what he's doing.  of course he does.  you guys just don't know how true artists what a shame. so glad no one got hurt.  accidents

that movie... you know, with that actor, and it had that scene.  goddard, data check: quentin smithee.   libby: "no match." he's a young, fresh, undiscovered talent.  smithee: darn that jimmy neutron.

 jimmy: mr. smithee, we have a little problem.  the other actors want to quit.  why.  it was either falling off the 40story building or almost crashing on the roller coaster.  oh, what a bunch of babies.  i knowi told them making great art can be dangerous, but they won't listen.  i'll speak to the others.  smithee: okay, you guys, look.  i know you've almost been killed twice in the past 24 hours.  but that was the pastit's a new day, a new scene.  any questions.  um, yes.  are you going to finish thatcroissant.  knock yourself out.  smithee: let me assure you that nothing can possibly go wrong in this next scene, because it's a big musical number.  we get to sing and dance.  and shake our tail feathers.  hold onthere's no musical number in my script.  studio wanted it.  you'll love it.  hugh: hey, quentin.  is this the scene where donut boy sings the donut boy theme song.   who's the supercool cop    that always gets the bad guys   : donut boy  : that's me, yeah.   he brings a delicious assortment of sweet delights   donut boy.  got a creamy filling.   no, this is the scene where you get lost.  donut boy goes missing to increase the suspense.  i love it.  byebye now.  all

you all are.  look, i know we've had some minor mishaps, but i'll guarantee your safety.  we have to finish my movie.  all: ourmovie.  right.  sam, another round on me.  come on, you could be movie stars.  think of it:..  monkeys.  by the barrel full.  i'm in.  no wayforget it.  we almost got killed three times.  just think of the hollywood parties, with those little weenies on the little buns.  designers begging you to wear their clothes.  your face on a screen 20 feet high.  and the monkeys.  tell me about the monkeys, jim.  monkeys as far as the eye can see.  so will you do it for your old pal.  will you do it for the jimster.   all: no.  cindy: butwe'll do it for the fame and fortune.  and the monkeys.  are they spider monkeys.  can they open up bananas with their teeth.  smithee: okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okaythe climax of our film.  this is where you become magicians, visit a dinosaur park and rescue the ruby slippers.  all: what.  he wrote it.  i just direct.  all right, i decided to set this scene in the 13th century, and they didn't have watches, so i'll take this, and here's your magic wand.  this isn't left over from a movie called, when sticks shoot 50foot flames,is it.  goddard, analyze.  jimmy: it's just a piece of wood.  that reminds me.  i know how sensitive a robotic dog's ears can be.  you.  get that mutt off the set.  striking the doggy.   okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okayfollow me.  uh... quentin, i noticed you made some changes to this scene87 to be exactand there's no ending.  oh, yeah, there'll be an ending, trust me.  but shouldn't we know what it is.  oh... let's just have fun with it.  lights, camera, action.  so, you are the evil one whose name is really hard to pronounce.  yes, and this is the end of you, perry bladder.  klaatu barada nikto.   smithee: oh, crumpets.  what's the matter with this.  nothing ever works.  : oh, why can't i ever...  finish anything.  the halfeaten croissant. he forgot to write an ending. no record of "quentin smithee". he didn't know how to start the cameraprofessor finbar calamitous.  and welcome to the last scene of the movie and your lives.         hugh: quentin, baby.  i'm back and i'm ready for my next big scene.  gramps, have you seen quentin around here.  jimmy: help.   help.  ooh, i bet this is the scene where donut boy saves the day.  hugh: come on, big, giant, uh, slither beast.  taste the sugary fury of donut boy.  butch, you getting the good side.  donut boy, you've made your last delivery.  wait a minute.  donuts.  no, thanks.  no, the gooey glaze of those donuts could shortcircuit the wiring on that snake.  dad, throw your donuts in the snake's mouth.  i don't think my character would do that.  all right, you're the writer.  eat donuts, you fiend.  honeyglazed.  chocolate.  chocolate with sprinkles.  lemon custard.   no. no, no, no, no.  no.  no....  oof.  i hate show business.  oof.  cut. that's a wrap.   that was totally cool.  yeah, well, you know i'd love to stay and chat, but i'd better get back to the house and wait for my fan mail.   get me out of here.  no, problem.  i'll get you out there and back to your nice,warm jail cell.  i'll get you, jimmy neutron, and when i do, i'm going to do something really...  well, evil, of course.  that goes without saying.  i'll have to get back to you on the specifics.  well, it looks like calamitous only did my screenplay to destroy us.  i guess i don't have any artistic talent.   all: nope.  still, it's too bad we couldn't finish the movie.  hey, maybe we can.  we still have the camera and film.  this time we'll do it exactly the way i wrote it.  cindy: no way.  this time we doourmovies.   judy, my love, this ranch and all my llamas could be yours if you'd marry me.  i can't.  i'm too blonde, too smart and too popular.   hold up, y'all.  cappuccino jones is here to bring the sass and kick out the jams. )
