 hph(]  as they're about to get the answer to the question that's on everyone's mind.  what did baby poof buy at the mall.     we just came to buy diapers.  for cosmo.   i was out.   wow.  i keep forgetting what a big celebrity poof is.   well, he is the only fairy baby in existence.      aww.   being a celebrity is great.  you get to be famous without having any skill or talent whatsoever.      you might want to back off, people.  when poof cries, bad things happen.   how could this adorable baby possibly make a bad thing happen.  click.         timmy, wanda, and poof what about me.   oh, and you too, carl.  it's great to have you visiting again.  and we want to welcome you back anytime as long as you bring poof.  because without him, you wouldn't be news, and without news, i'd have to get a real job.  for the fairy channel, i'm fairy hart wishing you all a fairy good night.   my name's not carl.  zap.   fairies.  they get all the press.  why.  antifairies have accomplished so much: spiders, paper cuts, pink eye, crazy cow disease.   that was all us.  good day, my evil little crumpet.     if i were you, i'd slow down a bit on those throw pillow sandwiches.  that's your third one this morning.   i can't help myself.  i got cravings.   as do i.  i crave equality.  according to this chart, there's supposed to be an antifairy for everyone fairy.  i'm anticosmo.  you're antiwanda.  there's even an antijorgen.   i made macaroni wind chimes. heehee.    why, then, is there no antipoof.  wait a minute.  hold the phone.   i can't.  i ate it.   twitching stomach.  snacking on houseware.  antibarf.  this can only mean one thing.  there is going to be an antipoof.  you're going to have an antibaby.    i'm so happy i could 'splode.  boom.     guys, why is there a big scary cloud coming toward us.   this is bad, sport.  my motherly instincts tell me there's been a terrible disturbance in the fairy force.   my motherly instincts tell me that we're going to need more diapers.  three, two, one.  yep. we need more diapers.      well. well.  where is it. where is my antibaby.   he's right over there.  the little darling.       hello, clarice.  i mean, mother.   ooh. he said his first words.  our baby.   i'm bored of you already.   ow.  he's pointy.  i'm going to call him gator.   i prefer "the dark harbinger of the doom " n a birthday cake.   no, silly.  you're the opposite of baby poof, and therefore your name must be foop.  hm.  hat sounded much more evil in m  that's not the point.  you didn't have to hurt carl's feelings.  well, ii didn't mean to.  i'm just looking for some straight answers here.  i guess i'll just have to look somewhere else.  why, of course there's a santa, jimbo.  he's a jolly old man with a white beard and a lazy eye, and every year he removes asbestos from the attics of all the good little boys and girls.  : oh, hugh, you're thinking of mr. hingis, the housing inspector.  you're right.  jimmy, darling, santa's not something you can prove with science.  he does exist because he's real in our hearts.  whoa.  and he has pixie dust, and he can fly.   thanks for coming over, guys.  say, jimmy, you're not going to stomp on carl's dreams again, are you.  oh, that's okay, sheen.  now that i've had some fudge, i feel much better.  you look better.  i'm sorry i hurt your feelings, carl.  i just didn't want you to be disappointed by impossible wishes like, well, like i was.  what do you mean.  well, two years ago i wrote santa asking for a core sample from dwarf star ng738.  i wanted it more than anything ever.  when i opened my presents on christmas morning...  no dwarf star.  that was the saddest day of my life.   sheen, what's so funny.  isn't it obvious, jimmy.  you were just naughty that year.  what are you talking about.  didn't you almost destroy the earth.  that's not the point.  jimmy was naughty. jimmy was naughty.  ugh.  i didn't want to do this, but you've placed me in a scientifically untenable position.  vox, initiate reindeer scenario 8.20b.  this animatronic model exactly parallels the aerodynamic potential of the average reindeer.  observe.  unable to fulfill the requirements of bernoulli's principle, it quickly plummets to the earthas would santa.  butbut santa's reindeer are magic.  yeah, he feeds them special kibble laced with jet fuel.   look, guys, i've run the numbers.  there is no santa.  well, if it's written on the blackboard, i guess it must be true.  i'm sorry, carl.  oh, that's okay, jimmy.   at least now i won't be hurt like you were.  ow.  sorry, jimmy, ii sat on your scanner thingy.   i've never seen a pattern like that.  carl, what's in your back pocket.  oh, just my bag of cheese nips.  sheen: ha.  there's your hard physical proof.  that snack is crawling with santa's mojo.  jimmy: snacks don't have dnaalthough the saliva on them might.  santa's saliva, yay.  hold on, hold onwe can't prove that short of traveling to the north pole and scanning for the same pattern, and we're certainly not...  to the north pole.  yay. we're going to see santa.  sheen: shotgun.  ugh, i have to work on my communication skills.  cindy: i love opening presents early.  i love rewrapping them and pretending to surprised on christmas morning.   oh, hey, what's that.  looks like another boneheaded neutron experiment.  he's bound to do something to embarrass himself.  hey, let's get it on tape and get back at him for making carl cry.   hmm...  nothing particularly humiliating in here.  what's this thing.   jimmy: hey, hey, guys, what's my hypercube doing on the ground.  you have to be careful.  infinite space condensed into a finite area is highly unstable.  relax.  what could happen.   well, that's everything.  climb aboard, boys.  next stop: the north pole.  santa.  oh, santa.  ah, save your breath, carl.  there's no life anywhere near here.  no. then how do you explain this sign.  the pattern's backand it's stronger than ever.  come on.  if i have to float here for all of eternity, i'm going to be really ticked.  there's one chance: maybe i can shake us loose by blasting my "headbangers christmas" cd.  that's just crazy enough to work.    "the north pole." am i dressed for it.  no.  carl: santa's house.  not necessarily.  it could be a cleverly disguised army outpost.  made of candy.       words and bladder control almost fail me.  sid, this is lou.  we need a crate of doll heads over on dock 11.  stat.  um, excuse me.  we're here to see santa.  santa. it's christmas evehe's gearing up for the big run.  so, no santa...  i thought so.  guys, this entire setup is a complete sham.  butbut, jimmy, what about the factory.  ha. it's just a gussied up warehouse, carl.  parents order gifts here, then use them as positive reinforcement for naughty or nice behavior.  how do you explain the elves.  we prefer the term "diminutive helpers." short guys with an ear condition.  now if i could just hone in on the source of this energy signal.    elves: ahh.  ho. ho.  ow.   what's that.  his atoms are scrambled.  production is halted..  well, i hope you're happy, kid.  your stupid scanner thing broke santa.  broke santa.  oh, no.  fellows, there is no santa.  more likely, we've blown the lid off their operation and now they're jumping ship.  don't try to weasel out this.  now we've got no one to deliver the toys.  christmas is canceled, and it's all your fault.  got it.  where'd you come from.  your infinite space cube thingy.  so, it wasn't enough for you to spoil carl's christmas, you had to go and mess it up for everyone else.  did you get that, libs.  yupvery spontaneous.  thank you.  look, everything's under control.  yeah, rightluckily, i've got a fivepoint plan.  go in close on my fivepoint plan.  point one: announce jimmy's screwup to the entire world.  point two: concoct a plan to save christmas.  point three:..  say goodnight, ladies.  girls: neutron.  sorry. had to be done.  and as for the christmas presents, i'll deliver every one.  ha. who do you think you are, santa himself.  no, that's the point.  i'm just a regular kid, and if a kid can deliver everybody's christmas presents using science, you'll all be forced to face the awesome, incredible truth: there is no santa claus.  okay, but the easter bunny's real, right.   i love the smell of sprayon snow on christmas eve.    hugh, hugh, turn on the tv.  the big story this morning: christmas has been canceled.  oh, no, that's the worse thing that could ever happen.  tv news person: all because of this boy, jimmy neutron.  except for that.  this dramatic footage, taken inside santa's workshop, captures the tragic moment.  ho. ho.  ow.  local videographers cindy vortex and libby fullfax had this comment.  it's important to remember point one of my fivepoint plan: "it's all jimmy's fault." poor jimmy.  he'll be hated and reviled by everyone.  well, maybe if folks had something else to celebrate.  hugh, you can't just invent a new holiday.  or can i...  that's it.  everybody likes pie, right.  if we could combine pie and yule, we'd have, uh...  pule.  that's it"pule".  dimple dumpling, you're a genius.   you still here.  i'm just about to test out my christmas equipment upgrade.  sheen, begin test of jinglebell powered sonic propulsion unit.   i've adapted my fuel cells so they're powered by sonic vibrations.  the faster i jingle, the more powerful our back thrust.  and i used a christmas light to install a guided navigational beacon on my dog's nose.    wow, goddard, you'll go down in history.  hey, carl.  finished loading the presents.  one billion, 999 million, 999 thousand...  call it an even two billion.  all right, then, let's head out.  you'll never do ityou only got 12 hours to deliver presents to every kid on earth.  no problem.  i've calculated everything down to the last nanosecond.  goddard, navigational system to power.  jingle bells to speed.  to move out.  got to blast.  jimmy: all systems are go for toy delivery.  first stop: norway.  lock onto our first house, goddard.  and you really think this is a good idea.  of course it is.  i'm "croppy, the pule duck." every pule eve i bring the gift of pie to children everywhere.  yes, it's all here.  good children get apple or cherry, and the naughty kids get mince.  oh, sweetie, do you really think this will help jimmy.  sureonce folks get in that pule spirit, they'll forget all about jimbo.  it's like the song says:  have yourself a happy little pule    let your heart sing out    pule's no time of year to sit and mope about.     here i am baking pies a lot  pies a lot   hope the crust is hot  crust is hot   and light  so light and fluffy   joyful friends start to sing and shout   to sing and shout   they won't dare to pout tonight   pout tonight   every year is like a different flavor    filled with rich pure    all your cares like  la mode will melt away   will melt away   so have yourself a happy little pule today.    oh, honey.  this will be the best pule ever.  jimmy: coming up on first target.  sven svensen, age four.  present: suctioncup finger ultralord.  got it.  wait, that's a rare collectible.  you can't just give it to some kid.  sheen, don'tno.  wait, it's christmas.  sheen: no.  sheen, get a grip.  we only have 11 hours and 57 minutes left.   good luck, honey.  quack, quack, quack.  hugh: merry pule to all.      who would have ever dreamed that people wouldn't want pie stuffed down their stocking.  sweetheart, maybe we could try again in the morning.  no, no, nopule's a failure.  i guess there'll be no holiday cheer this year.  there's always presidents' day.  mmhmm, that's the spirit, sugarbooger.  everything will be all right on presidents' day...   oh, honey, there, there.  enjoy your inane blinking contraption, japanese kid.  my calculations were perfect. we're finishing up right on schedule.  good job, sheen. nice work, carl.   carl. carl, what's wrong.  oh, nothing.  i think it's great that you've delivered all the presents...  and now everyone will realize that there really... is no such thing as santa.   don't cry, carl.  you're going to be one of the most famousous kids in retroville.  retroville..  holy heisenberg.  the sun's almost up, and we haven't done retroville.  there's just one chance...  with a lightspeed boost from this warp module we might make it.  hang on, everyone.  can't... maintain... control.  going... too... fast.    okay, this is quickly becoming a really lousy christmas.  i don't understandi had this delivery thing calculated down to the last decimal point.  wheehehehee.  what are you so happy about.  don't you get it.  jimmy couldn't deliver all the presents, right.  that means only santa can, right.  and that means santa's real.  you're right, carl.  that thought could fill us with the joy of christmas as weburnup through the atmosphere.   ho. ho. ho.   ho. ho. ho.  both: santa.  hollyjolly tractorbeamactivate.    santa claus.  it's trueyou are real.  yep, got my red suit. everything.  so you're jimmy neutron.   you've been on my naughty list for some time.  told you.  uh, sorry about the whole scrambling your atoms thing.  you're sorry.  i still got protons where my ions should be.  but you boys did a great job tonight.  can we still bring christmas to retroville.  ho. ho. ho. ho.  no, i'm afraid i've used up all my reserve energy rescuing you boys.  but you're santayou could do anything.   all right. all right.  i bet the tooth fairy doesn't have to put up with this.  just give me a second to think.  think. think.  brain blast.  jimmy, do you still have your warp module.  i think goddard has a spare.  maybe my magic sleigh can take light speed better than your rocket.  slap it on this dashboard and let's see what this baby can do.  initiate light speed... now.  santa: ho. ho. hohohooo...  santa, you did it.  that was amazing.  ah, that was easy.  i just realigned the quantum overthrax...  to compensate for the hyperspacial inversion.  bingo.  well, jimmy, maybe i'll see you next year.  stay away from fried foods, and have a very merry christmas.  santa: ho. ho. ho.  got to blast.  what a cool guy.  too bad he didn't have enough time to deliver presents to our house.  or did he.  my dwarf star.  "sorry it took so long"i had to let it cool for five years.  love, santa." of course.  i should have realized.  good morning, jimmy.  merry pule.  funny, it doesn't look like pule.  it looks... just... like...  why...  why, it looks just like christmas.  i got peace on earth.  and a robothemed orbiting deck with carnageinducing plasma cannon.  cool.  "thanks for believing in me.  santa."  yay.  i've been made an honorary elf.  elfie, elfie, elfie.  a lump of coal..  do me a favorthe next time i suggest we humiliate somebody, don't listen.   ooh. a 123piece hexsagonal carbonalloy ratchet set.  it's a goose.  hey, looks like i got a new hobby.  it's all thanks to santa.  sweetie, we thought you didn't believe in santa.  recent empirical data strongly favors his existence.  mom, dad, thereis a santa claus.   this is so much better than pule.  and i've got the perfect decoration for the top of our tree.  goddard.    christmas day, we're together    nevermind the where or whether    cause santa came through.   jimmy:  now i believe, too.   all:  we're basking in the warmth of christmas day.   ningcaptioni          xwhp            @@pxxhx (])84 (])84 (]hr (]hr (]@hr (]@hr (]@hr (]@hr (]@hr (]@hr (]@hr (]@hr (]@hr (]hr (]hr (]hr (]hr(]hr(]hr(]hr(]hr(]hr(]hr(](](](](](]t(]t(]t(]t(]t(]t <(]t < hlgptx< / m u(] hx(] xx(](](](] it's the scariest movie ever made about a boy turned into a fly, and all of dimmsdale will be watching.  you don't want to miss it.  oh, i'm not gonna miss it.  no one's more excited than me.  i have my blowfly action figure, my blowfly 3d glasses, and my blowflyflavored popcorn.   mmm, that's good blowfly.  i'm gonna love this movie.  oh, no, you won't.  that movie is rated is fttftt: " the blowfly movie is really scary, timmy.  it will scar you for life.  and that's our job.  so we'll just take your tv so you're not tempted to watch.  crash.  you know what responsible parents we are.  and now we can watch on two tvs.  okay, fine, no problem.  this is why i have fairy godparents.  thanks, wanda.  uh, that tv isn't for you.  it's for us.  we're going to watch the movie in the fishbowl.  so we need you to babysit poof.  we can't let him see it.  it'll scar him for life.  yeah, and that's our job.  so what am i supposed to do.  you can change poof's diaper.  that's even scarier than the movie.   sniff. sniff.  ah, this stinks.  there's got to be some way i can watch this movie.  if only i were a fly on the wall.  that's it.  poof, i wish i was a fly.  ooh. poof poof.  ha ha.  awesome.  i'm fly size.  come on, poof, it's movie time.  just in time.  i bet this is the part where the teenager gets the head of the fly.  gee willikers, i'm bound to get an "a" on my nifty body switching project. )
