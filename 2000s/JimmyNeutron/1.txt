and then you go oneway.  i love this game.  me, too.  one way.  one way. one way. one way. one way....  mom, dad, your one and only son is home.   i'm here. i win.  oh, let's do it again, jimmy.

100% indestructible.  step, step, step, step, step, step...  now what are we going to do, huh. huh.  oh, come on, think.  there has to be some solution.  solution, babution, tatution, labution

it to the moon.  my brother jimmy is the best.  i think he likes you.  goddard.  jimmy's got a girlfriend...  goddard, you stop that.  i am not.  darn it, turn it off before i unplug you.  and in conclusion much of today's modernday communication is thanks to marconi, who invented the radio in 1870.  marconi. didn't he invent those little cherries on top of ice cream sundaes, too.  oh, baby, i love those.  those are maraschino cherries, gene.  gotcha. you're pronouncing his name wrong, cindy.  it's macaraschino.  okay, you just zip it.  and that is why mr. marconi should be considered the father of modernday communication. thank you.  thank you, cindy. that was very informative.  there's only one problem.  how could marconi have invented the radio in 1870 when thomas edison didn't harness electricity until 12 years later.  it's americaschino, jerry.  what. how should i know.  maybe marconi's radio didn't run on electricity.  macaraschingos.  oh, right. i forgot about the ever popular mudpowered radio.  oh, and i forgot about your mudpowered brain.  hey, don't get mad at me,cindy.  all i said was that thomas edison is the one...  yeah, yeah, yeah. thomas edison, thomas edison.  just because you say his name all the time doesn't prove you're right.  hey, where you going, jim.  she wants proof  i'll give her proof.   i know it's risky, boy.  i'll just prove my point and send him right back.  i promise.  menlo park, 1899 and initiate time pinch.    that henry ford is such a knucklehead.  where am i. who took my iced tea.  wow, thomas alva edison.  now would you mind telling me what the patootie's going on.   and where in blazes did you get that.  where i come from that's copyright infringement.  copyright infringement.  no, no. come on. come on.  i'll explain everything in the hovercar on the way over.  hovercar.  what the rootytoot's a hovercar.  yeeheehee, i'm in a hovercar. whoo.  woo. that hovercar's a piece of work.  oh, thanks, mr. edison.  you know i achieved the upward thrust using strontium90encrusted fuel rods and titanium valves.  are you through.  it's not that great, okay.  and that's why you should never feed a hamok pancakes.  thank you.  jimmy: hold everything.  wha... jimmy, what's going on..  ladies and gentlemen i give you the world's greatest inventor, thomas edison.  cool. i never met a dead guy before.  hey, cindy, i just came back from the lost and found.  oh, really.  did you happen to see jimmy's point.   i'll handle this, jimbo.   so, you're cindy, eh.  well, listen up, chickiepoo.  the radio wasn't invented until 1893.  couldn't have happened without my electricity, neither but did anybody ever send me a thank you note.  no, they did not.  wait a second.  then who invented those cherries.  well, thanks, mr. edison.  now you probably have a million questions for me about the 21st century and the amazing scientific advances that we've made...  hey, where'd he go.  come on, darling.  give old tommy a peek at them gams.  fresh.  mr. edison, we should probably think about getting you back home.  jimmy, maybe your friend tom would like to see the town.  i happen to have some time in my schedule.  come on, boyo, let me step out with that teacher of yours.  woohoohoo.  bad idea, sir.  no offense, but see, if i don't send you back there's just a chance we might not ever be able...  i accept.  come on, baby.  let's get stepping, let's cut a rug.  let's paint the town red.  let's get jiggy with it.   so, tell me, honey, did it hurt.  did what hurt.  why, when you fell down from heaven.  oh...  tom.  come on, jimmy, come with us to retroland.  hey, they've added three new loopdeloops on the bat outta heck rollercoaster.  yeah, it's guaranteed to make you throw up or your money back.  i can't. i have to wait for edison and miss fowl to finish their "date." oh, right.    hey, what happened to the music.  i got it covered, dudes.  huh.  the jukebox disappeared.  oh, no, this is terrible.  i've let edison stay in the present too long.  everything that runs on electricity is starting to disappear because i've erased the father of electricity from history.   this is horrible.  you're kidding me.  how'd you do that.  well, off to retroland.  bat outta heck, here we come.  mr. edison, i...  if you're looking for captain bad hair day he just left with our teacher.   mr. edison.  hey, jimmy, check out my new wheelie shoes.  i didn't invent 'em, but i could have if i felt like it.  they're very nice, mr. edison but i've got to get you back to the lab.  oh, no. i ain't going back.  i like this newfangled world of yours and i got the hots for winnifred, too.  no, but you don't understand.  if i don't... winnifred.  if i don't send you back soon everything electric will disappear.  well, gee, jimmy since you put it that way, i...  get over it.   hey, don't scratch at it, boy.  without that solar battery, you could vanish into thin air.  now make with the options.  no.  possibly.  that's it. if i can break them up edison won't have any reason to stay here.  this is going to be like the wildest ride ever.  tell me about it.  i've haven't been this excited since...  wait a minute.  i've never been this excited.  here we go.    why have we stopped moving.  they probably just want to build up the suspense.  okay, all the blood's going to my head.  mine, too.  this is awesome. woohoohoo.  woohoo, hoo. hoo.  : hey, you mangy canine, get away from there.   fooled you. it's just me, goddard.  see, i installed a voice transformer inside this walkietalkie.  i talk right here thomas edison's voice comes out there.  observe.  whipdiddlydoo, everybody.  pretty good, huh. how open wide, boy.   aw, goddard, this is going to help me break up edison and miss fowl.  now, come on pretend it's a nice, crunchy lug nut.   good boy. good boy.  now here's the plan.   she's a hotsie, she's a scamp    digs my incandescent lamp    miss fowl, she is the gal for me.   ready, boy.   she's the gal, hey, what a gal    miss fowl's the gal for me.   oh, tom, you're such a romantic.  oh, you got that right, toots.  wait'll you hear this poem i wrote you.  roses are red, violets are blue miss fowl's armpits stink like an old skunky.  what..  wait a minute.  i didn't say that.  you said my armpits stink like a skunky.  winny, no, i didn't.  i think you smell much more like an old cabbage.  well, how dare you.  well, knock a hundred points off my i.q.  and call me tesla.  what in blazes is going on around here.  i thought you were a gentleman.  that's funny.  i thought you were a gentleman the first time i saw you.  can i call you manlady.  that's it. i'm leaving.  winnifred, wait.  yeah, manlady. wait.  stop that.  hey, manlady, can i get some fries with that shake.    jimmy.  what's he doing here.  and what's this.   it's a funny story, actually.  : hello. hello.  who's in there.  so, it was you saying all those things, eh.  all right, yes.  i needed to stop miss fowl from liking you so you'd be willing to go back to 1899.  you mean you don't think my pits stink.  no, no, no, no, no.  they're entirely tolerable.  and as for you, i ain't agoing.  well, of course, you're going, tom.  what.  but winnifred, don't you want to get hitched.  oh, tom, today was wonderful, but i'm not the marrying kind.  i'm a free spirit, a butterfly in the breeze going wherever fate wings me.  i understand, winnifred.  i knew you would, tommy.  jimmy, time for me to go home.  so, how'd you build that fancy voice dohickey anyway.  well, it was nothing.  i just diffused the frequency of the sound waves with a border device and a carbon transmitter.  all right, relax.  it's still not that big a deal.  woohoohoo.  yeah, take it to the limit, baby.  aw, yeah.  oh, thank goodness.  oh, man, bummer.  captioning sponsored by the u.s. department of education oh.  pox7xhxbxwxxb > xxbpxwpxxbpxw ph8 xn8pph8h xn8pxpph8xnx .ph8xnh xpx0xnh x
