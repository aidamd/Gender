 d if she thinks i lied.  you lied.  whose side are you on..  please, can't you use some of your crazy science mumbojumbo to help me.  you know, jim, you do have that one machine...  the ultrashock dance teacher 8000.  i suppose i could...  nah.  you've got to, jimmy.  the only respectable dance i know is the crazy porpoise.  here it goes.   okay, okay, just... stop doing that.  can do.   sheen: you're the best, jimmy.  once libby gets a load of my new steps, she'll beg me to be her boyfriend.  if you guys go on a date, can i come.  maybe we could play board games, make dinner and talk and laugh...  i think we're busy that night.  okay, maybe another time.  ready for your download.  sheen: hold on...  just give me a minute to...   so... how do you feel.  kind of funny.  goddard, cue the music.    whoa, sheen, i...  carl: whoa, oh, boy.  check me out.  i'm a hiphoptangoing fool.  sheen, be careful.   hey carl, i didn't know you played castanets.  that was my scapula.  jimmy: the download is timed to wear off in 24 hours, more than enough time to dance tonight's show.  and into libby's heart.   what.....  hey...  jimmy.  help.  what in the world.  goddard, execute emergency plan 372z.      jimmy...  were those nnninjas.  uhhuh.  what the heck did they want with me.  i don't know.  what do you mean he escaped..  hold on, i must talk to myself.  this chosen one is craftier than i thought.  okay, i'm back and i have a plan...  jimmy: sheen, think.  do you have any mortal enemies with access to ninjas.  no, but i have a halfcousin with access to the internet.  i've developed a plan in case the ninjas return.  what are those.  sulfur pellets.  if the ninjas come back, i'll activate the pellets remotely.  the gas should keep them dizzy and confused long enough for us to grab them.  whatever, dude.  miss fowl: sheen, you're late.  jimmy, i don't have you on my list of dancers.  i'm not in the show, but it's important that...  uhuh, no buts unless you're shaking yours tonight.  there you are, neutron.  i know you think the show is...  need a partner.  i'm your man.  you... are.   hey. where do you...  it's okay, cindy and i are in the show.  so all you need to do is catch me as i come down from my tripleaxel, midair betsy flip.  uh, neutron. yeah, betsy flip, sure, i got it.  carl, are you monitoring suspicious activity.  mmm, yup.  all clear, jim.   thank you, thank you, wonderful.  welcome to our first annual lindbergh festival of dance.  our first performer will be bolbi stroganofski and his sister, ignishka, in their salute to slap dancing.   slap, slap, slap    clap, clap, clap    slap, slap, slap    clap, clap, clap...   thank you, kids, that was fabulous.  bolbi, you might want to work on that splitoochy.  okay, next up we have libby folfax and sheen estevez with the hiphop tango.   ninjas.    wow.  this is better than broadway.  sheen.  jimmy, over here.  good, you got sheen. bbut where are the ninjas.  yeah, and where's libby.  libby.  oh, no.  the ninjas took libby.  neutron, where are you going.  we're on next.  what. you're not afraid of a few ninjas, are you.  neutron.  i can't believe it. my sweet, sweet libby's been kidnapped and it's all my fault.  this video was at the crime scene.  hopefully there will be some clues.   greetings chosen one.  by now my ninjas have taken your girlfriend...  not my girlfriend. shh.  she's not.  if you ever want to see her again, you must come to shangrillama and fight me kung fu style.  okay, i think that's it.  see you soon...  if you dare.  why does that monk kid want to fight me.  i don't know any chopsocky stuff.  we have no choice if we want to get libby back.  ready, carl.  pretty much.  whoa, hold upready for what.  i've downloaded the basics of kung fu onto a disk compatible with the dance teacher 8000.  now i'll just download them into you.  okay, just give me a second...   smooth.  now to see if it worked.  sheen, think fast.  ow.  you were supposed to chop it.  try telling mebefore you throw it.  ow. carl.  sheen, think fast.  awesome.  wing more stuff at me.   here you go.   let's go kick some monk.  i think this is shangrillama.  it's shangrillama, all right.  check it out.  monks : chanting in unison.  chanting in unison.  sheen: long time, no see.  how's everybody doing.  monks: fine.  still not wearing pants, i see.  monks: uhhuh.  you guys rule.  head monk: greetings.  we have been expecting you.  yeah, greetings.  what can you tell us about our friend libby.  i know no libby.  i know only that the chosen one must fight yoo yee in 48 hours.  and...  should be a good fight.  your monk snatches our friend, threatens the chosen one and that's all you say.  oh, right, i almost forgot.  try not to get your blood everywhere.  we just cleaned ring last thursday.  come on, guys.   just like i planned.  the chosen one and his friends have come to rescue you.  they will, too, and i'm telling them what you've done to me.  what have i done.  i'm keeping you in my sister's room.  yeah, and her cd collection is totally beat.  plus, ponies on the wallpaper.  please. what am i, five.  : i must speak to myself again.  when i am chosen one, i will command respect, not like now, where i command none.  don't try to escape.  you are locked in with locks on the door that create a locked environment.  ooh.  now, that's what i'm talking about.   my dna tracker says libby's being held somewhere k before anybody has to fight.  carl: whoa.   yoo yee: wheeheeheehee.  i'm flying all around.  i'm like a crazy manbird.  whee.  it's yoo yee's temple, and it's crawling with ninjas.  sheen: big deal.  with my new abilities, i can easily defeat them.  ddoes that include the one standing next to me.   uh, guys, let me handle this.  hey, jackie chan, nice pajamas.  now head back to gym class before you get a faceful of sheen.  perhaps we should give him a taste of my abilities.  oh, yeah, good idea.   ow.  ow.  ow.  okay, stop.  ow.  carl.  noyour download must be wearing off.   sorry about the pajama crack.  they look smart on you.    boys: whoa.    the dance machineit's broken to bits.  now i'll never learn to dirtydance.  no, carl, it's worse.  libby's too well guarded.  sheen will have to fight yoo yee, and without a download, he's doomed.  there's only one thing to do.  sheen: a tutor.  sheen, we have no choice.  why not give me piano lessons while you're at it.   yes.  mmaster hong.  yes.  dude, don't you think you're a bit old to teach kung fu.  snatch this pebble from my hand.  "snatch a pebble"how....   you're hired.  master, my friend has 24 hours to learn kung fu and defeat yoo yee.   impossible.  please, master hong, you have to help us.  yeah, he's the chosen one.  ooh.  the chosen one.  put your leg behind your head.   ooh.  a thousand pardons, chosen one.  come.  i will be honored to teach you what i know.  carl, you help with sheen's training.  i'll see about repairing the dance machine.  he who masters patience, masters all.  try to catch carp using only hand.  right.  concentrate mind.  become the stream.  you must feel the...  i got him.  i got him.  oh, baby, we're eating fish tonight.   so much for watching lady wrestling on payperview.  moving on.      mmm. mmm.  carl. why you little...  come back here.   now rise, chosen one.  rise.   concentrate.   i can't do it, master hong.  it is because you lack the eye of the tiger.  eye of the tiger.  sounds fattening.  quiet, carl.  where's an eyeofthetiger store.  eye of the tiger cannot be bought.  you must feel it in your heart.  without it, you cannot defeat yoo yee.  jimmy: we'll take our chances.  sheen, it's time.  thank you, master hong.  nice boys.  gonna be a short fight.  jimmy: i managed to reconstruct the dance machine as best i could.  carl, do you have the kung fu disk.  oh, i was afraid of that.  without a proper conductor chip, the current will overload the circuit board.  sheen, it looks like you're on your own.  chosen one.  here we go, guys.  this is for libby.  : oh, no.  sheen's fighting yoo yee.  oh, he doesn't have a chance.   prepare to meet your fate, chosen one.  no "how was your flight, what hotel are you staying at, chosen one." he is mocking my social skills in public.  i will show him no mercy.  you're talking out loud.  we all hear you.      get back here.   i can't look.   libby: guys. guys.  libby.  i escaped from a room.  anything i can do.  no, i'm afraid...  libby, is that a ruby on your head.  yeah, but i'm not sure it's your color.  you're more sapphire.  no, rubies are an aluminum oxide mineral.  it'd make the perfect conductor for the dance machine.    wheeheeheehee.  what is the matter, chosen one.  can't you fly.  oh, all you can do is bend your leg behind your head.     sheen, how many fingers am i holding up.  november.  carl, we don't have a lot of time.  put in the kung fu disk.  right.   commencing download.   huh.  libby.  hey, where am i.  sheen, listen to me.  you're in shangrillama fighting yoo yee.  cool. am i winning. well...  define "winning."  all: go, sheen.  carl: let him have it.     carl, you put in the dance disk.  i... he...  bbut i was nervous and the different colors and i...  dance, sheen.  dance for your life.  come here, dancing boy.   tapdance as fast as you can.   sheen's doomed.  ouch.  sheen, put a hurting on this fool.  you hear me. this is your girlfriend talking.  : girlfriend.  girlfriend.  girlfriend.  girlfriend.        swing your partner round and round    then hurl him down onto the ground.    sheen, you did it. way to go.   you think this is over..    cindy. but when did you....  how did you.... when did you....  if i want to do my tripleaxel, midair betsy flip, then i'm going to do my tripleaxel, midair betsy flip.  oh, and the hover car needs gas.   head monk: to the chosen one.  long may he put his leg behind his head.  to the chosen one.  all: chosen one.  thank you. i'd like to say i couldn't have done it without you guys.  i'd like to say that, but none of you were any help.  monks: uhhuh.  he's got that right.  okay, enough sitting around.  let's kick it.   relax, jimmy.  it was probably just a case of mistaken...  ow.  man: cut.   woman: cut.    i'm a flying boy.  so graceful.  surely you are all jealous.     put your leg behind your head.   that's going to hurt in the morning.  moving on.  okay.   hphxphjp2hxwxwpxwxopx pxoxxwppxwpxwpxwpxwpxwpxwppxw0p0pxw0xw h xw8r0xw8r0xw8r0xw8r0xw h0xw h0xw got to blast.  . into the

. for jimmy neutron. .     captioning sponsoredby nickelodeon sheen: come on, jimmy.  we can't be late for libby's birthday party.  she asked graystar to play, and if i eat soon, my cakeandicecream sugar rush will coincide perfectly with their first song.  yeah, and i need to stake out a chair near the punch bowl in case this year i want punch.  jimmy: cake and punch, while essential for human life, aren't nearly as exciting as this.  it's nice, jimmy, but i think someone already invented the arch.  this is not your average arch.  behold.  sheen: wow...  that looks like the future.  jimmy: 15 years into retroville's future, to be exact.  jumpsuits are so slimming.  jimmy: may i present the chronoarch, a portal through timeand this is just a general picture.  using dna tracking, i was able to locate all three of our future selves.  first... the future sheen.   jimmy: apparently you're a top male model.  it's frontpage news every time you change your socks.  i can't believe iti change my socks.  now, the future carl.  man: carl, the llamas you breed can survive underwater, build homes for the needy and filter out unwanted phone calls.  what's next for carl.  well, david, i think you'll be surprised and delighted by carl's latest advances.  i know i was.  jimmy: and now, yours truly.  and as the first scientist to receive the nobel prize in bulk, i would like to ask, "can somebody help me to my car with these."  man :"  wow.  the future used to fill me with fear and dread, but now i can't wait for it.  we don't have to.  that was just view mode.  in travel mode, we can step through the chronoarch and go to the future right now.  i'm sure the future me has one and can send us back safely.  but libby's expecting us at her birthday party.  sheen, it's atimemachinewe'll go to the future and return when the party's getting good.  ow.  careful, guys.  i've been experimenting with my new chemical, megalomanium.  it makes anything it touches mad with power.  ow.  come on, let's go.  well, can we drop our presents at libby's first.  i took a wrapping class at the learning hut, and i don't want my work to go to waste.  i'll get the hover car.  can you wrap mine, too.  it's the essence of lavender over there.  sure... ow.  ow.  ow.  flower, cut. cut it out.  i'll cover you, carl.  grab the bottle and let's go.  ow.  ha.  you want a piece of me.  sheen: you want a piece...   i got it.  ow.   ow.  let me out of here.   all: happy birthday, libby.  hey, guys.  ohyou brought me presents.  i'll take those. )
