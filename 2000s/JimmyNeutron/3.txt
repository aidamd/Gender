 carl: the universe.  it's really, really, really, really big and stuff.  join us now as we voyage into the unknown onscience with jimmy.  yay.  heyho.  that's enough, car sorry.  uh, hi.  welcome toscience with jimmy.  today's segment is called "fun with heavy gravity." and so, without further ado, i give you the gravitrax sk30.  i shall now attempt to alter my assistant's density via graviton particle bombardment.  atomic batteries to power.  turbines to speed...  initiating sequence...  now.   it tickles.  andvoil.  the test subject is now much heavier.    uh, well, it's kind of hard to see, but take my word for it.  his atomic structure is now really, really dense.   psst.  jimmy, this experiment's a stink burger.  move on.  no, no, no, wwwait.  maybe if i increase the intensity...   jimmy, i feel kind of funny.  we need more power.  look at our little jimbo.  the camera loves him.    uh, i can fix that.   oh, no. run.  let's get out of here.  my mistake. the camera only likes him as a friend.  now,that'sgood television.  uh, that's all the time we have.  join us again next week.  bye.  well, jimmy, that was the worst show i've ever seen.  i understand.  i'd fire me, too, if i were you.  oh, no, no, no, no, no, on the contrary.  we've decided to retool the format to make it kind of remotely interesting.  really.  that's great.  who's "we".  your new creative team.  jimmy, i'd like you to meet the new producer ofscience with jimmy.  no.  and your new cohost.  no.  jimmy, calm down.  we know that you want the show to educate people.  we deeply and genuinely respect that.  no.  you do.  of course.  we just want to make a few tiny adjustments.  exactly.  you have our word that science will always come first onscience with jimmy.  please, you seriously expect me to trustyou.  if you don't do the show, we'll get someone like i said, time to make some showbiz magic.  dad, you've been bitten.  you're turning into a giant worm.  run, run, son.  run while you can.  i love you, dad.  jimmy, where you been the last few days.  in the lab.  letting cindy and libby produce gave me time to focus on the science.  yeah, uh, listen, jimmy, there's something you should know.  i've come up with some great new experiments.  this is going to be our best show ever.  he's living in a dream world.   wwhat happened to my set.  do you love it.  "funky jam dance party".  with some science.  you said you were only going to make some tiny changes.  and theyaretiny.  jimmy, baby, you're mr. science.  just do the show the way you would normally.  yeah, jimmy, don't sweat it.  we're here to support you.  places, peoplewe're on in ten.  i don't know, sheen.  this doesn't feel right.  duh. i told you the show needs more puppets.  and we're live in three, two, one.  cue lights, cue music, cue funk master nicky nick.  funk master nicky nick.   hey, everybody, it's time to get down with america's favorite educational program, funky jam dance party.   with some science.  whatever.  and now give it up for the bigheaded brother with the pointy do, jimmy neutron.   hello and welcome tofunky jam dance party with some science.  in today's segment, we'll be taking a look at electron valance orbits.  and kick it.   what. i didn't get a chance...  to represent lindbergh elementary, we're the liberteens.    do you want to be my lab partner.    uhhuh    uhhuh    do you want to mix some chemicals.    oh, yeah    i'll be your testtube baby    at the funky jam dance party...   i can't let them ruin my show.  goddard, fetch the acoustic amp.  sugarbooger, come quick.  jimmy's new show is funkerific.   we're gonna fill our beakers    mmhmm    mmhmm    with sulfuric funk    whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.    test me with your litmus paper    at the funky jam dance party...      and we're back, with sciencethanks to the acoustical absorption properties of my amazing acoustivac.  funny story about quantum sonic fluctu...    and now it's time for adorable hunk tricks.  i want you to give it up for nick.  what's up, nick.  i'm going to style my hair without using my hands.  can i get a drum roll, please.   hey, hey.  forget the hair.  i'm offering you a miniature fusion reaction which perfectly duplicates the sun's carbonnitrogen cycle.  yo, nick, flip your hair again.    ha. huh.  whoo.  give it up.  got to get my show back.  by the spirit of enrico fermi, science shall never take backseat to mindless pop culture again.  goddard, the gravitrax.  godgoddard.  that does it.   get us down.  i can't work like this.  whee.  hey.  hey, neutron, what's going on.  whoa.  girls: whoa.  thus, we see how reversing the polarity on your gravitrax can render any lousy dance act virtually weightless.  neutron, get us down from here.  please, join us next week when empirically deduced data will once again be the star of the show.  well, kids, congrats.  zero gravity, funky dance party jam with some science killed in the ratings.  too bad i'm going to have to cancel it.  what. why.  because the network president doesn't like science, music or dancing.  well, then, what does he like.  sheen: we must destroy the giant worm.  sheen: no, you mustn't.  that's my father.  : psst, carl, that's your cue.  carl: oh, sorry.   must destroy world.  ow. gee, that hurt.  fuzzy puppet house party with no science is puppetastic.  dad, that's not even a word.  judy: eat your popcorn, dear.  man: you're an extraordinary fellow, mr.  boy genius.  well, prepare to meet your... um, oh, uh, whatever.   today i found something that no one has ever seen before in the history of the worlda halfeaten crunchy creme jelly donut.   but they're 100% irresistible.  no one cannot finish one.  i'm afraid i know someone who couldan old student of mine, finbarr calamitous.  this is his bite mark.  he's back.  so what's so special about finbarr calamitous.  oh, he was a brilliant boy, but he could never finish anythinghomework, inventions, sentences.  that's why i failed him.  and he was bad.  like me.  no, nick.  you're bad in the new sense of the word, meaning good.  finbarr was bad in the old sense of the word.  he disappeared one day after not finishing his lunch.  i wonder why he's returned.  carl.  what.  i don't know.    are you back home early from your mother's, sugarbo...  hey, you're not sugarbooger.  good morning.  i've come to, uh, um, um...  install cable.  snake my drain.  clean the chimney.  yes, clean the chimney.  i'm a chimney, um...  you're a chimney sweep.  oh, that's just grand.  like the guy in the movie.  do you sing and dance.  that costs extra.  it always does.  never mind.  all clean.  by the way, where is your, your...  bathroom.  duck collection.  son.  yes, your son.  the genius.  well, jimbo's at school.  he does that during the day.  does he have something he really cares about, like, um, uh...  a girl.  tennis racket.  different girl.  dog.  he does have a dog.  oh, yes.  show me the, um...  the furry, barky thing you mentioned.  that's goddard.  yes, it is, yes, it is.  jimmy made him all by himself.  he does eleven million and four things except clean up after himself.  that's my job.  kind of like a hobby for me really.  may i take him for a...  ice cream.  grand tour of europe.  walking.  yes, the third one.  we usually don't let random chimney sweeps just walk in and...   well... good night.  mommy.      do you guys think that, you know, sometimes in the right light miss fowl looks kind of...  hey, hold that thought.  lookup in the sky it's a bird.  it's a plane.  it's a selfpropelled android traveling at approximately 237 miles per hour.  oh... sorry, carl.  what were you saying.  nothing, never mind.  hey, goddard, i'm home.  goddard.  dad.   i must have just dozed off there for... hmm, six hours.  nothing like a nice nap.  where's goddard.  uh, goddard.  he's right here with the chimney sweep.  jimmy: goddard's been dognapped.  by a big, giant, scary chimney sweep.  man, that would make one sweet action figure.  nobody stealsmydog.  except that guy.  sorry.  i've got your dog, jimmy.  which means soon i will have you or my name isn't... um... oh, um...  oh, right.   i'll take to the skies.  keep on the lookout for any suspicious activity and meet me back here at 1600 hours.  i'm counting on you guys.   it's too bad goddard was stolen.  but this is so cool.  we're like two real live cops on a case.  yeah.  let's go eat.  by activating goddard's builtin homing device, i'll find him faster than you can say...   there he is.  he's under the house somewhere.  sheen, carl, i've located goddard.  i'll signal if i need backup.  roger.  we'll sit tight here in case the guy who stole your dog comes in for a snack.  over and out.  who's roger.   goddard.  up here, boy.  aw, don't worry, goddard.  i'll have you out of there in no time.  good thing i brought my swiss army laser.  let's go.   hello, jimmy.  please allow me to introduce myself.  i'm... um... um...  um... no... uh...   finbarr calamitousthe guy who could never finish anything.  well, aren't we the smart one.  but not smart enough to avoid walking right into my little...  it starts with a t.  trap.  correct.  and now you are going to be my scientific slave and finish all my... my...  jimmy: sentences.  calamitous: no.  my... my...  inventions.  inventions.  finish my inventions.  and then i will take over the... um... uh...  universe.  smaller.  retroville.  and all those fools who laughed at me.  they called me "half done" and "never finish," which weren't particularly good nicknames, but they stung all the same.  wait a minute.  if you never finish anything, how'd you finish that robotic suit.  who says it's finished.  i never put in a bathroom.  speaking of which, i'll be right back.  pay no attention to the short, skinny, bald man stepping out of the, um...  i'm not helping you do anything, mr. calamitous.  that's professor calamitous.  and i'm afraid you have no choice.  you're trapped, neutron.  you see, these walls are made of pure chromium steel with just a hint of magenta in the piping to really bring out... oh, never mind.  first you will complete my ultimate disintegrater.  at the moment it only makes things moist and soggy and kind of, oh... not crumbly exactly.  more like, um...  ultimate disintegrater, eh.  okay, i guess you win.  i'll fix your machine and help you take over retroville.   calamitous: really.  a wise decision.  by the way, how is my old teacher, miss, um... um...  miss fowl.  why, she's fine, thanks for asking.  do you think that sometimes in the right light miss fowl looks kind of...  finished.  fast as you are smart, eh.  so now begins the destruction of, of...  your wall of steel.  calamitous: it works.  i always knew i could do, um... um...  jimmy: it.  bye.  oh, pooh.  i wish i'd seen that, um... um...  jimmy: coming.  yikes.  for a bumbling genius, he's pretty dangerous.   he's on our tail.  jimmy: ugh, i can't shake him.  so i never finish anything, eh.  we'll just see about, um... um...  think, think.  calamitous: i never put in a bathroom.  brain blast.   ohh... oh, goodness.  oh, monkey lumps.  why didn't i put a bathroom in this suit.  ooh, sheen.  it's the perp.  hey, yeah.  you wrestle him and cuff him and i'll watch.  why do you get to watch.  fine, forget it.  let's just hide quietly.  may i use your, um... um...  telephone.  teeth whitening kit.  restroom.  restroom.  no, it's for paying customers only.  all right, i'll have a chocolate, um... um...  sundae.  rumball.  milkshake.  officer tubbs, man that bathroom.  uh, thanksdon't mind if i do.   hmph.  nooooo.  yeah, another evildoer sent packing.  glad we could help, jimmy.  what are you talking about.  you guys didn't do a doggone thing.  oh, didn't we.  jimmy: no.  well, at least we didn't screw anything up.  come on, carl, let's go eat some candy.  fighting crime really gives me a appetite.  calamitous: i'll be back, jimmy.  you can run, but you can't, um... oh...  oh, oh, ohhop.  go too fast or you'll slip.  chew gum at the same time.  oh, just forget it.  xx8p&hxxx8p&hxxx8p&hxxx8p&hxxx8p&hxxx8p&hxxx8p&xh ' hx.x8'(]'hhtp8xkhht p8hht p8hht p8hht hht   timmy is an average kid    that no one understands    mom and dad and vicky always giving him
