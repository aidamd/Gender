"downloading tuneup".  that's a stupid name for a game.  it's a good thing i always carry a copy of decimator: crush the planetthat i conveniently started carrying yesterday.  cool, i suddenly love science.  our percent".  come on, download.  aw, come on, turner, be patient.  you're a bulgy scientist now.  good science requires discipline, perseverance and, above all...  i'm bored.  hey, where'd i put my poofer.  i guess this is my poofer.  hard to tell when everything looks so weird and bulgy.     aw, first that selfish, crabby kid poofs in here, and now you two. is everybody wishing they were in the greatest lab in the universe..  this lab belongs to jimmy.  carl, don't you see.  thisisjimmy.  another experiment must have gone horribly wrong.  this time he shrunk his own head.  my name's not jimmy, it's timmy.  oh, you scientifically altered the first letter of your name.  huh.  you maniacal genius.  hey, i'll let you two hang out if you show me how to work this stuff.   we could do that.  sheen, no.  bigheaded jimmy said we should never touch his stuff.  quiet, carl, the smallheaded are easily manipulated.  this could be our chance to play with some of the coolest, slightly more dangerous experiments.  that i could use to win first prize in the science fair.  let's get experimental.  i love this new smallheaded jimmy.  oh, yeah, i'm bad.  i'm in the robowalker.  i feel nauseous, but i'm bad... bad.  huzzah.  let evildoers beware the wrath of guyinabubbleman.  hey, where'd smallheaded jimmy go.    smallheaded jimmy, are you okay.  my new bulgy skull might be cracked, but my new bulgy mind doesn't care.  let's do it again.  wow, this new jimmy puts the "mental" in "experimental".  james isaac neutron.  look at this mess.  honestly, jimmy...  my name is timmy.  timmy.  i think people in your dimension use "j" instead of a "t." gee, what a jwit.  oh, so now we're a mr. smartymouth.  well, that's it, young man, you're grounded.  what'd i do..  hmm, might i suggest a hypnobeam.  ooh, excellent choice.  judy: didn't you hear me.  i said you're...  i can bend others to my willcool.  you think that you're, um, mighty mom.  quickly spinning around, judy neutron transforms herself into...  mighty mom.  superpowered defender of domestic order.  my hyperdomestic senses detect dirt and danger and dirt.  vacuumpowered flying abilities, activate.  whoosh.   i'll clean that up.  uh, i don't know, new jimmy, maybe this stuff istoo dangerous.  aren't you worried that we're tampering with forces we can never hope to control.  don't you mean "jampering".  and no, i'm not.  so, about this skateboard...  i think i'm finally getting  wow, look at smallheaded jimmy go.  yeah.  his lack of concern for the safety of himself and others is bold and refreshing.  dust bunnies, surrender.   hugh: yeah, butterbiscuit, i can't tell, is this a mole or just a scaly patch.  why, it's my faithful sidekick, lintboy.  it's "lintman." into your spandex leotards, lintboy.  we've got to scour this town of evil.  "spandex..." i get it.  you want to play one of those special games, eh.  all right, but let me chase you this time.  behind the refrigerator and beyond.  whoosh.  all right, i'm coming right behind you, my mistress of meticulousness.  look at me, i'm flying.  cindy: i'm telling you, susan b. anthony could totally kick madame curie's butt.  incoming.  that could have gone better.  neutron, you dolt.  why don't you look where you're flying.  that's not neutronthe head's too small.  and that overbite could crack open a sea turtle. hey.  let me guess, you must be one of neutron's online, 3d chess club pals.  great, just what this town needsanother bigbrained chess geek.  look, i said i was sorry.  too late, pawntokingduh.  it wasn't my fault.  the controls are very complicated.  maybe to a hamster.  looks like all you have to do is press the studs.  really.  whoohoo, look at me.  i'm doing it...  and not crashing into stuff.  although, i kind of miss the crashing into stuff.  hey, you're pretty smart.  want to help me with my science project.  you're asking for a girl's help.  you actually value my opinion.  sort of.  careful, cindy, it's a trick.  i'll bet neutron put him up to it.  no... i think he actually means it.  looking good, smallheaded jimmy.  cindy, libby, have you met new smallheaded jimmy.  you can call him "new jimmy" for short.  this isn't jimmy.  this is one of his friendsone of his much cooler, betterlooking friends.  i love this universe.  are you mad, woman.  look at his head.  tell her, smallheaded jimmy.  tell her how you shrunk your own living head.  uh, i'm going to go with what she said.  what's the most challenging part of 3d chess.  uh, trying to remember how that horsie thing goes.  cindy : you're so funny.  hey, jimmy, where are you going.  i think we've just been flat left.  oh, man.  i hate new smallheaded jimmy.    judy: lintboy, quick.  to the mom lair.  : now you're talking.  hey.    hey, mighty mom.  household avenger, open up.  lintboy needs to recharge his power pack.   goddard.  player one, your future is canceled.  down boy, no...  no, down... down.  puking plutonium.  my hands.  my arms.  my depth.  it's gone.  where... where am i.  that bucktooth kid must've used this to teleport me out of my own lab.  i've got to get back to goddard.  if i'm not there to monitor his tuneup, the atomic transmutation could run wild.  there's got to be some sort of instruction manual to this teleportation pen in here.  no manual.  no fish.   no... hmm...  maybe under the bed.  both: aloha, timmy.  timmy. who's timmy.  i'm jimmyjimmy neutron.   i'm not familiar with how you greet people in this dimension, but okay...      all: hi, timmy.   solo: scream all you want.  all: we're still going to kick your butt at the science fair tomorrow.   oh, no, that kid isn't timmy.  his swirly, fudgey hair is way too perfect.  worse, if he finds out that we're timmy's fairies, we'll have to go away forever.  what are you.  i'm cosmo.  and i'm wanda.  both: and we're... um...  holograms, of course.  hey, hands off the wife.  oh, and capable of independent rational thought.  you must have been programmed for superintelligence.  did you hear that.  he called me superintelligent.  this looks like a job for...  my brain.  go ahead, go ahead, ask me something.  why are you still talking..  se hey, timmy.  ready for school and the big science fair.  it's not timmy, it's jimmy.  jimmy neutron.  oh, sure it is, son.  i'm sure this amazing disguise has nothing to do with the fact that you don't want to go to school because you didn't finish your science fair experiment.  i remember the time you wanted to avoid that math exam and you were kent quasar.  when you didn't want to go to the dentist you were buzz adams.   oh, it's rich.  i don't have time to do a science fair project, and i'm not timmy.  of course you're not.  that's why we brought notvicky, your notbabysitt you to notschool.  don't worry, mr. turner.  i'll make sure jimmy here gets to school safe and sound.   : as soon as i get this fake head off.  aren't you going a little fast.  you'll never stop in time at this velocity.  stopping.  that's funny.  screams) different world, same physics.  both: hi, nottimmy.  you two.  you got to help me get back to my world and get that other kid back here.  we can't do that, jimmy.  timmy's got to wish for it.  so you only respond to a voice command from a specific human frequency.  i still have no idea what you're saying.  kent quasar didn't choke cats.  you seem to be able to alter your appearance and location at will.  well, timmy doesn't want anybody to know about us.  we have to be careful.  that's probabl you're imperfect prototypes.  well, she might not be perfect, but she's the one who said yes.  aw...  hey.  jimmy: science fair.  that means fellow scientists.  maybe one of them is smart enough to explain this dimension's technology.  all: hey, it's kent quasar.  i'm not kent quasar.  oh, rightbuzz adams.  no, jimmy neutron.  all :..  nice new bighead disguise, timmy.  didn't do your science fair project, huh.  huh.  huh.  huh.  huh.  no, i'm not timmy.  i'm jimmy.  jimmy neutron.  and i am not sanjay, i am yogi bear, and i am smarter than the average bear.  very well.  since you're clearly timmy turner, here's your daily "f".  ah, an "f".  it bur..   oh, but that's not all.  plus, since you're turner, you get the series of vicious beatings i had planned for you today.  hey, there's no skull in this fake head.  and there's still more.  you still have to do your science fair project, which you haven't even started.  i'm not timmy turner.  and arted yet.  he invented this teleporting pen.  he's a genius.  egad.  uh, fingerpaint.  you are not the boss of me.  at last, at last.  fairies.  gigantic craniums...  teleporting pens...  children claiming to be smarter than the average bear.  there's only one logical explanation for turner's head becoming that large: fairy godparents.  i knew it was only a matter of time before my diabolical transportation science fair caused one of those children to invent a device that i could use to teleport me to the legendary...  fairy world.  home of fairy godparents.  i must get that magic pen.  pen.  i mean, fairies.  what am i doing back here.   oh, no.  something's wrong with goddard's molecular structure.  these readings are off the scale.  maybe it responds to voice commands like cosmo and wanda.  uh, actually...  to retroville.  hmm, why didn't it work.  there's probably so much technology in this room it's interfering with the teleporter.  i should get farther away.  to retroville.  darn it.  to retroville.  hey, your head looks smaller.  what. i'm just trying to be supportive.  llevame a retroville.  hola, seor fudgehead.   what's the deal with this thing.  it only teleports me back to this room.  sorry, amigo.  it's specifically designed to teleport timmy back to his room.  aw, that's limited.  hmm...  hey, a game buddy.  if this pen's technology is as adaptive as you guys are, i should be able to combine it with this so i can teleport anywhereeven home.  retroville, all right.  i'm out of here.  you're not going anywhere, turner.  now that i have this magic pen,iam.   magic.  are you nuts.  there's no such thing as magic.  you're not fooling me, turner.  no mag then what do you make of this.     oh, no.  we're in fairy world.  way to go, genius.  tell me more about your interests, timmy turner.  what makes you tick.   stuff makes me tick.  junk makes me tick, too.  but wickedawesome stuff, that's what really makes me tick.  incredible.  the technology you're talking about must be on the cutting edge of the very latest scientific paradigms.  you talk funny.  smallheaded jimmy.  smallheaded jimmy.  d's gone berserk.  you have to fix everything just like you used to when you had a big head.  what.  come see for yourself.   heel, boystay.  stay... down.  good, giant mechanical goddard.  good, good. stay.    wow. cool, the dogbox became the decimator.  it took a long time to download, but i think it paid off.  you mean you did this.  well, it is my game.  you design software, too.  timmy, you're amazing.   new jimmydo something.  your dad's about to get stomped.  aw, relax, it's just a harmless game.  besides, at this level, decimator is so slow you'd have to stand absolutely still for him to get you.   oh. ow.  does your game have a lot of cool features.  basically, decimator locks on to moving targets, then, every time he defeats a player, he gets bigger.  hahaha.  ooh. ooh. show me how to play.  show me how to play.  me next, me next.  look, guys, you're cramping my stylewhich apparently i have in this universe.  i think cindy actually likes me.  eww. eww.   help...  me....  call...  my...  mom... mie.   so, i'll see you guys later.  me and cindy are going to try out some more science projects.  ready, cindy.  you bet.  ugh, i may be sick.  oh, it's okay, libby.  you can be new best friends with us.  i may be sicker.  don't worry kids, i got...  everything is under control.    player one decimated.  player two...  your future is canceled.        it's going to destroy the town.  let's get my video camera.  sheen, no.  it's up to us to stop it.  jimmy's gone, new jimmy's useless, and cindy's acting like a complete snobi mean, what's up with that.  tell me about it, girlfriend.  you're right, libby, it's up to us, which is why i have comformulated a bold plan.  to the emergency space pods.  why don't we just go after the dog.  that works, too.  so, dr. mildew, once again i've foiled your insidious plan.   you were right, cindy, mutating stuff is fun.  and easy.  just remember: the left button is for animal dna, the right button is for plants and some algae.  cool. you're the smartest girl i've ever talked to.  really well, not a lot of girls talk to me, so... yeah.  timmy, i think we may be ready to take our relationship to the next level.  you mean... like... spin the bottle.  no, mindphone.  i want to hear your deepest, most personal thoughts.  uhoh.    player two decimated.    player three decimated.  players four, five and six, your future is canceled.   : d = 2 pi r.  "diaphanous." diap...  some things that fly there be, birds, hours, the bumblebee.  gee, cindy, your thoughts are smart and pretty.  let's try you.  uh... i'm not really a hat person.  announcer: hello... and welcome...  to celebrity steel cage monkey boxing.  uh... ah...  say, cindy, you'd still like me even if i weren't smart, wouldn't you.  haof course not.  but it's irrelevant, because you're the smartest, most sensitive, most honest guy i've ever met.  yeah... i got it going on, i guess.  carl: gangway.  smallheaded jimmy.  goddard's still berserk.  guys, i told you, there's nothing to be scared of.  decimator is a completely harmless video game.  it even got a "tripleg" rating.    it got a "tripleg".  for "gratuitous, gutwrenching, gorefest."   the gameisout of control.  i got to get back home so cosmo and wanda can help.  where'd i put my poofer.    he gave his life to save us.  i won't let his sacrifice be in vain.   i am going to have to punish that dog.  i'm going to need a really big newspaper.  i'll wait till sunday.   oh, man... can't take these fumes much longer.  whoa.  uh... uh...  i wish i could see cindy one more timei never got a picture of her to prove to my friends she really exists.  cindy : timmy, can you read me.  are you okay.  cindy. where are you...  and do you have a digital camera and a computer that can send a picture to a parallel universe.  cindy: um, no.  i managed to tap in to your minilaser's frequency.  it's not my poofer.  then i'm going to be dipped in acid.  try using the minilaser to cut that rail you're on.    wow, it worked.  all right.  i took a girl's advice and it worked.   i did it, cindy, now what.  i have an idea.  i can guide you to goddard's power core, we might shut him down.  sounds good to me, just tell me where to go.  down the corridor and left, quick.   he's targeting the purple flurp factory.  oh, no, if he destroys it he might cause a flurp spill.  that much corrosive sugar could dissolve all of retrovillejust look what it did to my molars.  shut it.  sorry.  timmy, we're out of time.  you'll never make it.  think of something.  cindy: um, um, um...  try a brain blast.  a what.  a sudden burst of intuitive insight.  something to save our butts now.  i don't know what she's talking about, but she's counting on me.  got to think. think. think.  i'm bored again.  i wish i could just pop the disk out and quit before i lose, just like i do at home.  timmy: quitting always works.  timmy, that's it.  if you can disconnect the drive, it's game over.  new player, you have dared to challenge decimator.  your future is canceled.  find the green terminal box and pull the red switch.  got it.  he's arming his rockets.  timmy, get that box open.  oh, nomy laser's out of juice.  you can do it, new jimmy.  use your giant teeth.   whoohoo, yes.  victory is mine.  who says quitters never win.  i'm the king of the...  whoa... whoa.  i'm okay.  you did it, cindy, you and timmy saved the town.  too bad about jimmy's dad, though.  green... leftovers... my one... weakness.  quick, lintboy...  help me reach my... utility belt.  oh, not tonight, sugar booger, lintboy needs to spend time in his fortress of iodine.  door closed.  strength returning.  mighty mom lives.   t up.  way to go, cindy.  i knew you could do it.  you don't fool me for one second, timmy, i'm smart enough to see through your little shammysham.  huh.  what are you talking about.  you made it seem like you didn't know what you we doing.  you created this whole crisis just so i could solve it.  well, for your information, mister, i think that was unbelievably sweet.  ah, gross.  who's up for a group hurl.  heygoddard's shrinking.  his normal program is rebooting.  he should be his old self again.   whoohoo.  good job, goddard.  look, something's coming up on his screen.  calling goddard.  can you hear me.  come in, boy.  my readings indicate you're now back to normal.  timmy: hey, it's that kid, cindy: it's neutron.  but i thought that...  then you're not...  everything i know is a lie.  hey, what are you doing in fairy world.  well, some lunatic sucked me into your computer simulation.  what lunatic.   no.   finally, i'm in.  i've made it to the legendary fairy world.   they said it didn't exist.  they said i was crazy...  and i am.  crazy like a guy who was right about fairy world.  i think i'll take the vip tour.  both: crocker.  ladies and gentlemen, girls and boys, welcome to fairy world's vip tour.  uh, excuse me, are you a human.  no...  uh, i'm a nymph.  anyone but a nymph wear a hat this stupid.  oh. it looks good on you, though.  then welcome aboard.  on with the tour.  you brought mr. crocker to fairy world.  what kind of genius are you.  you scrambled my dog's atoms and let a girl in my lab.  what kind of genius areyou.  back off, nerdtron.  timmy here has already saved the dayand saved your dogin half the time you would have.  look, i need you to...  uh, like i care about what you need.  as long as my dog's okay, we are done.  tour guide: and that's the fairy academy, where we train fairy godparents.  fire.   that's okay, we're here to learn.  tour guide: and over there is the fairy armory, where we store every magical fairy weapon known to fairies.  it's the only place in fairy world that, in case of an emergency, has its own power supply.  any questions.  i have a question.  let's say i was this human.  if i somehow stole that magical weaponry, would i be able to, say, oh...  force the surrender of fairy world and be made king of all fairies.  oh, absolutelyespecially if you were evil enough to destroy the big wand. that's what powers all our magic wands.  if you took that out, we'd have to surrender.  since there's no chance of that, let's talk aboutthe exciting world of crowds.  thank you for your very informative tour.  ah.  the fairy armory.  just think of the fairy havoc i can wreak with these fairy weapons.  think.  i mean... fairies.  crocker's gone.  that means i'm stuck here.  i got to get that teleportation device and get out of here.  can this get any worse.  if by worse you mean somebody's knocking over the big wand, then yes.    i knocked over the big wand.   freeze.  magic or not, i am still powerful enough to defeat you with my special brand of fairy justice.  woof.  woof, woof.  bark, bark.  woof.  i will defeat you...  after i defeat this evil stump of a tail.   what's wrong with you guys.  oh, he's cut off our supply of magic.  that's righti'm in charge here now.  get ready...  to make me your king.  if we're going to get that teleportation pen, now's my chance.  hey, what are you doing.  making an electromagnet.  by wrapping this wire around this metal crown, and attaching it to this power source, i can create an electromagnetic coil.  steady.  voil.  thank you, electromagnetic valence bonding.    good luck with your new king.  wait, fudgehead.  you can't leave us.  crocker's going to...  zap the memory.  wipe the c drive.  so what.  you're computer programs.  you're not really real, right.  if we weren't real, could i do this.  or this.  or could i do this.  cosmo, wanda, finally.  timmy, you have to stop him.  he's going to let crocker wipe our c drive, whatever that means, and i like to wipe my own stuff.  how many times do i have to tell you, you aren't real.  timmy: yes.  yes, they are.  they are real.  what do you mean "real".  you're holograms.  all of this is a big computer game.  how do you care so much about them.   goddard.  of coursegoddard.  he's computerized, isn't he.  well, cosmo and wanda are as real to me as goddard is to you.  look, i'm sorry i broke into your lab.  i'm sorry i almost broke goddard.  what about the girl in my lab..  i'm sorry about that, too.  cindy: hey.  . play along, toots.  jimmy, you have to save cosmo and wanda.  they're my best friends.  you have to.  crocker: oh, fiddlesticks.  how could i miss that.  i was aiming for his big fake head.  do something, fudgehead.  do something...  fudgehead.  wow, they're really upset.  maybe these are more than just holograms.   so if they disappear, they're gone for good.  i can't let that happen.  i've got to do something.  but what.  come on, think.  think.  hey, timmy, are you ready for the big science fair.   you guys do what you can to stall crocker.  i'll be right back.  oh, no.  fudgehead left us.  i always knew you couldn't trust a fudgehead.  i need raw, uncompromised technology, and fast.   ah, silicone and test tubes.  i missed that smell.  one solarpowered laser...  a fully equipped doublewide, and presto.  after i take care of one little detail.  ah, the fairy capitol building.  it looks so beautiful and so... not ruled by me.  we'll have to fix that.  freeze, sucker.  hey, i should force them to make me their king.  maybe i'll have a court jester.  i hope he tells jokes and not riddles.  jokes have punch lines.  you better have punch lines.  well, okay, but only because you asked.   you again.    crocker: so, turner, that fakeheaded robot suit might intimidate some other people, but you're still going down.  and then, i'm going to give you an f...  minus.  no one gives jimmy neutron an f.    come on, come on,move.  got you.  say goodbye, timmy turner.  how many times do i have to tell you.  i'm not timmy turner.  technically, he's not even jimmy neutron.  now.  i don't understand.  why isn't it powering up.   i knew it wasn't plugged in.  hold it right there, turner.  prepare for a smaller head.  move, jimmy, move.  aha.  all: yahoo.  fudgehead did it.  you can...  you can trust a fudgehead.  whoohoo. yay. whee.  whoohoo, yay and whee all you want, little fairies.  i'll still have the last laugh.  once you're out of the way, i'll blow that big wand out of existence.  oh.  i don't think so.  say hello to my big glowing friend.  hey, that's my big glowing friend.   hey, no fair using magic against me.  i don't know if i believe in magic, but i do believe in virtual programming.  time to override your hard drive.  hey.   i surrender.  enough.  dog: no, it is not enough.  get ready, tiny human, as i shred your memory to bits with my muscular canine teeth.    nice doggy.  and if you'll look to your left, you'll see a puny adult human male being shredded by a buff magical schnauzer...  and having his internal organs rearranged.   jimmy, you did it.  and not a hair out of place.  well, i couldn't let anything happen to my new virtual pals, could i.   cindy.  nerdtron.  pancakes.   ah, don't worry, boy.  all i have to do is reverse the polarity and i can get back home.  yeah, yeah.  i can handle this.   he's so smart.  i wish we were both back in our own hometowns.  wish.  what's wishing going to do.  jimmy neutron, boy genius.  timmy turner...  boy.  thanks for saving my dog.  thanks for saving my... uh...  fairy programs.  sure, fairy programs.  sorry i was such a jerk.  no problem.  wegeniuseshave to stick together.  uh, between you and me, i'm not really all that smart.  i knowi kind of figured that out when i saw all the fs.  : i'll never forget you, timmy turner.  never.  wait for me.  wait for me.  cindy, i know you've been through a lot the past few hours, but, um... get out of my lab.  well, children, since mr. crocker lost his memory, apparently in some sort of bizarre schnauzer incident...  schnauzers... no.  no.  i'll be judging the science fair tonight.   well, crocker lost, goddard's safe...  and i met a nice young man with fudgy hair.  not a bad way to spend a day.  but i never got my science fair project done.  i'm still going to get an f.  timmy, where's your science fair project.  well, i... um, you see, i...  oh, my.  look, it is a flying hound of robotic descent.  why didn't you think of that.  hey, i'm just one of 11 guys.  : i knew i'd figure out that teleportation device sooner or later.   timmy, what an astounding project.  you get an "a" and first prize.  you're clearly smarter than a.j. or his clones.  thanks, boy genius.  ah, don't mention it, average kid who no one understands.  is that timmy.  timmy.  hi.  tell him i said hi.  jimmy: get out of my lab.  danonino with magnets that make growing up fun.  danonino.  ..  astronaut.  ..  doctor.  ..  karate teacher.  y is for yum.  help your child collect the magnets of the alphabet.  you'll find in one in every specially marked package of danonino.  m is for magician.  no matter what they want to be.  danonino is powerpacked to help kids grow.  @/h8phjw @/@2wh @2w pgh @2 /h on my mark, carl.  walk under the ladder... now.  looking good, jimmy.  no bad luck so far.   my skin smells funny.  your idea to have a friday the 13th dance is already jinxing us.  what were you thinking.  bad luck is just a silly superstition.  that lightning was just a coincidence.   sheen, why is this step a different color than the others.  oh, that one was broken, so i fixed it using one of jimmy's old lightning rods.   come on, carl, let's take you to the nurse.  it's a lot safer there.  uh, you know, cindy, everyone's going to be taking, um... )
