breakin' out of here and t'aint nothin' you can do about it.  nobody is breaking out.  you antifairies are always being chaotic, always trying to break the rules.  you, prepare to join your friends in the antifairy hoosegow.  never.    i shall return, my dim beloved.  this i swear.   dream on.  i will buff up my security system.  i will take away your ability to be invisible on earth.  and i will

partner was my best idea ever, dr. moist.  i'm so glad that we met at the evil scientist expo.  yes.  between your robot suit and my paralyzing operatic high notes, that bank never knew what hit it.  calamitous: ah... you fool.  you weren't watching the neutron detector.  friendship over.   so i see you managed to escape the force field i trapped you in back in the cretaceous period.  yes.  and i had a long time to contemplate my revenge, neutron.  get a life.   who needs a partner.  i'm going to finish you off all on my own.  not if i can stick you with an antigravity disc first.  what.  no.  i'll get you, neutron...  well, that's done.  now to get back to cindy.  jimmy, we came to help you fight professor calamitous.  yeah, the doctor says i'm okay.  the electricity passed harmlessly through my spine.  now, if you'll excuse me, i need to ask cindy something.  no problem. whatever, holmes.  we made it.  we're in retroville.  oh, dear.  this universe makes my hips look fat.  what universe doesn't.  it's neutron.  disguise yourselves.  jimmy: timmy. timmy turner.  how did you get back into our dimension.  oh, hey.  well, i, uh... used my technogeektoid wristwatch to warp here and stuff.  ihola, fudgehead.   carl and sheen: smallheaded jimmy.  guys, his name's timmy.  carl and sheen: smallheaded timmy.  what up, small headster.  how are ya, big teethster.  hey, i bet you guys know where cindy lives.  cindy.  what do you want with cindy.  i'm here to ask her to my friday the 13th dance tonight.  yourfriday the 13th dance.  we can show you.  but only if you promise to get us there in an unsafe and irresponsible fashion.  well, i, uh... wishi could do that.  maybe if i go behind this tree...  later, dude.   cindy wouldnevergo to a dance with a lunkhead like timmy.  unless he fooled her into thinking he's really smart and really funny.  he's so smart.  you're so funny.  no.  then neutron just flies off, leaving me there.  not that i wanted to go to the dance withhim.  well, whoare you going with.  you think a date's just going to come crashing in.   hi.  remember me.  i must use this power for good.  timmy turner..  of course.  how could i forget someone with your charm and mental acumen.   you still talk funny.  awesome ride, timmy.  yeah... i got hit in the head.  but okay me am, i think now.  uh, guys, could you give me a second.  i need to ask cindy something very important.  you came all the way from your universe just to askmesomething.  now, that's what i call panache.  huh. they do speak spanish here.  isilencio, estupido.  so, uh, here goes.  cindy, would you like to...  jimmy: wait.  cindy, there's something you have to know about timmy.  back off, fudgehead.  you're cramping my style.  sorry, timmy, but somebody's got to tell her you're not a genius. what..  oh, of course he is.  how do you think he got here, magic.  : magic.  he's just pretending he's a genius so you'll go to his friday the 13th dance with him tonight.  timmy, that's so flattering.  really.  well, my humongous, genius brain figured you'd feel that way.  cindy, this is all an incredible confabulation.  i've had enough of you, mr. bigwordusing guy.  you heard the lady, i am so a genius.  oh, yeah. prove it.   there.  how do you like my quantum boxingglovegadget thing that i just invented.  that's it, tiny brain.  it's go time.  oh, yeah.  bring it on.  nerd fight. nerd fight.  wow, timmy's amazing.  he invents stuff so fast, you can't even see him do it.  cindy, are you really going to let those two guys fight over you.  um... i thought i might.  girl, you are my hero.  okay, turner, if you're a genius, try to counteract my freeze ray.  ha.   yay, smallheaded timmy.  oh, but we still like you, too, bigheaded jimmy.  now, face the power of my...  i wish i had a burp cannon.  burp cannon.      thanks, goddard.   time to expose this faker once and for all.  i wish i had a cool rocket like neutron's.  uh... that i will now invent behind this tree.  looking for me.  is there a movie on this flight.  yes, and it's called "don't let jimmy hear you." oh, i love westerns.  calamitous: well, back to the resumes.  finding a good collaborator is my only chance of defeating neutron.  "can also do light housework." hmm...   my neutron detector.  he's on the move again.  watch it, brain boy, pick a lane.  what's this.  someone else fighting neutron.  and beating him, by the look of it.  how does he build stuff so fast.  hi, fudgehead.  quiet. we're in disguise.  i mean... tick, tick, tick, tick...  it's over, isn't it.  you're realitybending computer programs.  that's how you're doing all this.  so what.  you've got your stupid science stuff, and i've got cosmo and wanda.  um, can i just say one thing.  sure.  mountain.    well, that's settled.  timmy.  oh, all right.  i wish this button would save jimmy.  do we need to tell anyone about this.   in your face, neutron.  i outgeniused you and saved your butt.  calamitous: incredible.  that small boy defeated neutron with his tiny flying helpers.  i must find out where he got them.  neutron, you boob.  you almost got timmy killed.  cindy, timmy's not a genius.  oh, please.  you're just jealous because he's way smarter.  yeah. what she said.  cindy, why don't we go someplace where we can talk about tonight's dance.  say, my dimension.  i'd love to.  bye, nerdtron.  have fun dancing with sheen.  cindy, wait.  goddard, i'm going to dimmsdale.  and so am i.    what.  oh, the position's filled.   hey, jimmy, i don't know what this stuff does, but... here.  thinks he can just open up a dimensional wormhole, sweep cindy off her feet and then "poof" back to his universe.  calamitous: yes, go on, neutron, open that portal so i can learn the secret of that bigtoothed child's floating collaborators.  done.  now, it's time to save cindy from the horrors of a dumb dance date.  yo, i told you i'm coming, too.  cindy's my girl.  and we have no lives, so count us in.  okay, okay, just hurry.  we're running out of time.  neutron's labit's open.  well, maybe just a little peek.   whoa.  look at me.  i'm totally flat.  and you, my dear...  oh, don't even go there.  so, where do you think timmy and cindy are, jimmy.  don't know. we'll have to split up.  but be careful, this turner's a wily one.   having a good time, my transdimensional sweet.  i can't believe we're flying on an actual pegasus.   actually, cindy, the term is "winged horsy." i can't believe you found the dress of my dreams, with tiara and shoes to match.  and i really can't believe your parents are billionaire supermodels.  this day has been so perfect, it's as if somebody somehow got a hold of my diary and wished every one of my secret dreams came true.  yeah.   what are the odds.  i wish this thing was back where you found it.  oh, timmy, this is the most magical day of my life.  do you know what would make it even more magical.  uh, you agreeing to be my date to tonight's friday the 13th dance.  i might go... if you show me your lab.  huh..  both: huh..  your lab.  where you make all your inventions.  neutron never wants me in his lab, but you're not like him, are you.  ha. not in the slightest.  i wish...  no. not another word.  i don't want anything to spoil this moment.  don't say anything until i see your steamy den of scientific discovery.  sorry about this, dude.   welcome to my lab.  can we go now.   beakers... centrifuges... test tubes...  and a cloning tank.  who is that.  i'm, uh... building the perfect bald kid.  and you have a gene splicer.  uh, sure.  timmy, i'm ready.  you can ask me to your dance now.  cindy, i...  oh, but not here.  someplace romantic.  someplace i'll always remember.  okay, i wish...  and not another word until we get there.  i want to cherish this moment.  i know just the place.    i made it.  good going, calamitous.  now, there must be something in neutron's infinite storage cube that can help me find that bigtoothed boy's flying helpers.    hi, mr. turner, i'm looking for...  another reality avoidance costume, eh, timmy.  oopsi mean, "buzz adams." looks like someone's date was a disaster.  what. date.  you know what else is a disaster.  the toilets.  get to work, buzz.  hey, this wig you're using to hide your shame makes a great handle.  timmy: ah, this is nice.  cindy, would you... would you...  carl: hi, smallheaded timmy.  hi, normalheaded cindy.  carl. sheen.  what are you guys doing here.  jimmy brought us.  he's trying to find you.  he is.  uh, look out for that sand storm coming towards just you two guysthat i just wished for.   cindy, i...  libby: yo. cindy.  cindy: libby.  did he ask you yet. what did i miss.  tell me everything, girl.  uh... uh... hey.  is that a famous hiphop star.  where..  is it lady ladeedah.  uh... sure.  i wish.  : yes.   timmy: okay, one more time.  here we go.  cindy, will you...  libby: smallheaded timmy.  here, smallheaded timmy.  here, boy.   would you excuse me for a sec.  do you mind.  you guys are totally cramping my style, which i now have in my own universe with this one girl.  well, that one girl is my best friend, and i ain't going anywhere until i know she's happy.  and libby is my girl, and i'm not going anywhere until she's happy.  or unless ultralord is involved in some way, shape or form.  and i just want to see what llamas look like in this universe.  look, what if i gave you guys my pink and green fair...  uh, realitybending computer programs to play with.  i don't... okay.  works for me.  all right, but if neutron was right and you break cindy's heart, reality isn't all that's going to get bent, get it.  got it.  cosmo, wanda, i wish you would do whatever these guys tell you to do.  because that wish always works great.  take us where the llamas are.  finally, a llama wish.  jimmy: i can't believe i'm scrubbing stupid timmy turner's stupid toilet with a stupid toothbrush.  finished.  man, those highfiber energy bars we supermodels eat zip right through you.  you're going to need this.  no.  yay.  i'm the llama king.  come, my loyal subjects.  whee.   now give me giant feet.  no, noi know.  give me a tv for a head.  no, no, noi know.  make me best friends with morgan freeman.  now we're getting somewhere.   i may never brush my teeth again.  maybe that's how turner's teeth got that way.  it's neutron.  who needs tiny collaborators when i can just dispatch neutron myself with one of his own weapons.  hmm, this looks suitable.  what.   never be clean, never be clean...   professor calamitous..  my hypercube.  "to do list: 1) travel to parallel universe.  "2) capture big tooth's flying helpers.  3) destroy neutron." so he's after turner's computer programs.  son.  i'm having another highfiber energy bar.      i say.  somebody is cooking up a delicious stew of bad luck.   sweet muffins.  i never had this much bad luck in my universe.  "my" universe.  wait a moment... are you from another universe.   you're... you're one of those tiny flying creatures.  you can help me destroy my nemesis, jimmy neutron.  of course.  i'd be happy to help with whatever it is you're blathering on about, provided you do me one teensy favor.  at last, complete and total lockdown.  the ultimate defense against fairies, antifairies and even the occasional gnome.  nothing of this universe can get in or out.  hello, my good man.  oh, hello.  hey.  this the emergency release button.  you bet.   i will never allow you to escape.   well, your friends are free.  now you help me defeat neutron.  yes, about that...   i thought you were going to be my collaborator.  you lied to me.  yes, i do that from time to time.  it's almost like i'm evil.  well... ta.  ready, cindy.  ready, timmy.  cue the swans.  jimmy: wait.  huh.  neutron.  you are here.  cindy, listen to me.  calamitous followed me here to use turner's floating computer programs for evil.  oh, please.  like anything bad's going to happen on my watch.   oh, no.  a wormhole is opening up.   howdy, y'all.  oh, yes, howdy, indeed.  we're free. free.  now i can send my antifairies out to halt the earth's rotation.  tomorrow will never come, making every day friday the 13th.  um... why would you tell us that.  because i know you can't stop me, fool.   he called you fool.  do you always have to get the last word.  yes.  timmy, you said there was nothing to worry about.  who's worried.  i'm not worried.  do i look worried.  you should be.  the sky is filling with your evil computer programs.  mine.  yes, yours.  and now, let's pause a moment as i perform the inyourface dance.  . in your face, in your face .  . in your face, uhhuh, in your face... .  oh, i wouldn't be dancing in his face if i were you.  soon, every day will be friday the 13th and bad luck will rain down upon you in perpetuity.  and it's all thanks to you and your friend calamitous.  yeah, way to go, nerdtron.  oh, and thank you, timothy, for luring him up here by showing off cosmo and wanda.  ta.  in your face. in your face.  in your face.   look, don't worry, i've dealt with these guys before.  we can stop them, but we'll need cosmo and wanda.  t you lent them to carl, sen and libby.  well, they could be anywhere.  jorgen: all right, calamitous, i agree.  we will team up in order to escape.  i will now use your puny, otherworldly body to bash my way out of this cell.  but i can't...   break...  free.  can i just say something.  what.  he left the keys in the door.   nice job.  neutron, what is that thing.  it's a sound wave detector.  we find the funkiest beat in a 100mile radius and we'll find libby.  cosmo and wanda should be with them.  brilliant, neutron.  thanks, but i don't hear anything yet.  well, maybe it's being drowned out by the sound of you patting yourself on the back.    anticosmo: antiladies and antigentlemen, lend me your antiears.  it is time for... the master plan.  you, get out there and cause as much bad luck as possible.   while you take to the skies.  circle the globe at hypersonic speeds to stop its rotation.   once you succeed in slowing the rotationthe earth, time will stand still.  tomorrow will never come.  it will be friday the 13th every day and bad luck will reign forever.  cockadoodle...   you boys are awfully quiet.  undoing all the trouble he's caused takes concentration.  you're who calamitous followed here.  if you weren't jealous of me and cindy...  you knew i liked cindy and tried to steal her from me.   wait, i hear something.  there they are.  libby.  jimmy: carl. sheen.  timmy: cosmo. wanda.  herbert noodleman.  what. everyone else got to say a name.  so much... llama love.  : so much funk.  come on, sheen.  these lines aren't going to memorize themselves.  so much morgan.  oh, nothey're suffering wishoverload.  libby, you've got to wish cosmo and wanda back to me.  why you. i'm the genius here.  look, they're my programs and i know how to make them work.  listen, cindy, i know some of this is my fault, even though most of it is neutron's, but all i wanted was to take you to the dance.  these boys are still fighting over you..  oh...  are they.  i hadn't noticed.  go ahead, give timmy his programs back.  i wish... timmy... had cosmo and wanda back.  i wish that every wish carl, sheen and libby made didn't happen, and they were all their old selves.  : "yes, roxanne, i am leaving you." : i can't go on.    cosmo, wanda, quick.  i wish the antifairies were gone.  goodbye, antijerks.  there's too many antifairies.  they're interfering with our wands.  well, you're the "genius" here.  what do we do.  crocker's lab.  uh... i mean, my other lab.  cosmo, wanda.  antifairies.  i will stop them with my mighty magic wand.  or not.  plan b: hide.      : guys.   welcome to my other lab.  this isn't your lab.  yes, it is.  then why are there pictures of your teacher everywhere.  because... i love to learn.  does that explain your picture with a dart in it, and that sign that says "i hate timmy".  uh... i have low selfesteem.  me, too.  cindy: ow.  no.  no.  no.  what are you looking for.  aha.   a butterfly net.  both: a butterfly net.  if it has wings and flies, a butterfly net can catch it.  really.  hmm.  aha.  if i can combine this butterfly net with my hypercube, i might be able to suck all those rogue computer programs into it.  i just remembered.  i don't have low selfesteem.  i have low blood sugar.  and...voil.   cosmo: watch it, fudgehead.  good idea, neutron.  uh, i'll stand over here and make sure cindy's okay.  you okay.  : uhhuh.  good work, timmy.  now, come on.  lets go kick some butt.   what's that.   must have been dreaming... about fairies.   i've got you cornered, turner.  no, mother, not the tiny pants.       tv announcer: bad luck amuck.  i'm chet ubetcha saying, it's friday the 13th in dimmsdale and i can't change the calendar.  timmy: okay, here's the plan.  we need to get all the antifairies in one place so neutron can suck them up, okay.  uhhuh.  uhhuh. you bet.  you bet.  both: there's a plan.  operation antibad luck is now in effect.    you'll never get away.  and there's nothing you can do to distract us.  ah. we need to break more mirrors.  sheen, give me a high c.  okay, here's a "l" over high "c."  .la..    : it's a bad luck buffet.  carl: look.  i'm running under a hundred ladders.  yes. yes, lovely.   marvelous.  i cannot resist the siren call of your delicious bad luck.  now to really ramp it up.   wow, look at all that bad luck.  oh, i can't resist it.    mmm. yes, yes.  spilling saltthe tastiest bad luck of all.   what.  get back. back.  you're supposed to be halting the earth's rotation.  cockadoodle do...        bad luck, old chap.  nay.  nay, i say.  oh, we were so close.  so close.    oh, rat poopy.  both: all right.  you rock, dude.  now that that earthshattering crisis is over, back to business.  oh, boys...  nice work, guys.  you both did a great job.  : him.  it was my net that saved us.  cindy, it wasmyhypercube.  i'm cindy's hero.  no, i'm cindy's hero.   cool.  when we get back home, can we get them to do our homework.   ah. the infinite storage cube.  with that much harnessed energy, i'd be invincible.  negative.  those antifairies are going back to jail.   calamitous.  i can't let him get the hypercube.  and i can't let neutron look good.  i'll stop them with this.  timmy. no.  that's your gene splicer.   jorgen: what is happening here.  calamitous: we have... been fused... together.  jorgen: must... maintain... dominance.  calamitous: not a chance.  my mind... stronger than you.  he's big.  he's mean.  he's gross.  where's he going to buy shirts.  finally.  an allpowerful collaborator of my very own.  with my genius and your power, i'll be invincible.  if i could move my arms, i would so totally beat you up right now.  you mean like this.   why are you hitting yourself.   why are you hitting yourself.  why are you hitting yourself.  can't move... of my own will.   becausemywill's in charge.  and now for my first trick.  cindy. watch out.  i saved her.  noi did.   jimmy. timmy.   wait, i should not be laughing.  this is a terrible situation.  and yet...  i find myself unable to resist your... your influence.   i will get you for this.   cindy: jimmy.  timmy.  the only boys who ever fought over me and they're gone.  hey, let go of her.  do not worry, little girl.  it is against the rules to use magic to...  silence.  sorry, girlie, i can't have you avenging your boyfriends' demises.  you're coming with me to retroville.   cindy.  jimmy.  smallheaded timmy.  milton bimowitz.  what.. he's the king of vaudeville, and he plays the spoons.  oh, joy.  having a magic partner in crime has allowed me to finish almost every item on my new todo list.  i've terrorized the inhabitants with prehistoric creatures...   imprisoned jimmy's loved ones in carbonite, and prepared a delicious picnic lunch to nourish my strapping new body.   this sandwich is unacceptable.  sourdough is the lowest form of bread.  you'll eat it and you'll like it.   this indignity will be avenged.   mmm, spicy mustard.  my two favorite people are gone, and now you're probably going to get rid of me.  oh, a gentleman would never harm a lady.  besides, i need to keep an eye on you while i complete my greatest plan of all.  behold my big bang bomb, with shockwaves so powerful, they'll tear the very fabric of time.  the earth will revert to its original state, allowing me to remake it in my own glorious image.   you madman.  could you please pass the pickle relish.  oh, no.  our old best friend and our new best friendboth gone.  they'd barely begun to hate each other.  we're doomed.  calamitous is megapowerful and the only two people who could stop him are toast.  why.    actually, we're snails.  but the french eat us with toast.   timmy. jimmy.  jorgen's magic didn't destroy you.  it just turned you into cute little snails.  cool, i want to feed them.  who's got some snail biscuits.  guys, calamitous took cindy to retroville.  we've got to save her.  this is our fault.  our stupid competition has endangered the woman we... )
