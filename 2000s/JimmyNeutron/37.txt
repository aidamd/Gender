oh, no you don't, mister.  grab him.  grab him right now.  pull hown.  goddard, plot a course for the most deserted place in town.  well, look who's here.  mr. i'm going to invent the best candy in the world and put the candy bar out of business.  ow, sam, ii didn't mean to.  i didn't know my candy would be that popular.  ha.  that's what the guy who invented underpants said.  anyway, you better skedaddle.  that angry mob's going to be here any minute.  how do you know that.  i called them.  what did you expect.  i'm going broke here.  : candy, candy, candy...  uhoh. rthmic chanting.  that's

you...  an endless supply of the greatest candy in the world.    ouch.  yeow.  ow. agh.  ow. ow.  oh, man.   i love it.  ihateit.  i knew some day i'd find a use for the edible shock ray.  houldn't be much longer before they're all sick of this stuff.   hey, jim.  you know all the garbage cans in town are filled with your candy.  i know. isn't it great.  looks like everyone in retroville is back to normal.  sheen: hey, jimmy.  that last batch was delicious.   also incredibly painful.  hey, do you guys smell smoke.  i can't feel my face.  how come everything looks blue.  jimmy: aah, it's nothing really.  anyone with talent and determination could've germinated this magnificent specimen.   showoff ration 18%.  ah, this thing must be busted.  but it can't bei designed it.   hey.  mmm.  i told you, goddard, i'm trying to lower my perceived arrogance level so cindy will stop calling me a knowitall.  but it's hard not to seem like a knowitall when you do actually know it all.   oh... how asked you anyway.  after all, how many kids could've successfully cloned a 64millionyearold piece of spinach stuck between a museum dinosaur's teeth.  jimmy. breakfast.  i'll eat on the way.  wish me luck on my botany project. bye.  good luck, dear.  oh, here's your breakfast, hugh.  thank you, sugar...  wait a...  this is bread.  soft, floppidy, untoasty, noncrunchy, blah, bread.  i know.  dear, i may have mentioned to jimmy about how hard it is to wash the outside windows.   another toaster gone.  every time we get a new one he converts it into something else.  i'm getting...   the rare punching plant of malborn nine as seen inultra lord, episode 64 "attack of the salad vixens." looks like a boxing glove glued to a fern if you ask me.  well... nobody asked you.  anyway, what didyou come up with that's so wonderful.  i researched plants' responses to musical stimuli.  this one got two hours of classic r&b a day.   while this one got two hours of yodeling to the oldies.   that one looks dead.  it never had a chance.  hugh: oh, oh, oh, honey, honey, look.  today's the big toaster show at the convention center.  oh, they're going to have all of next year's models before they come on the market.  toast, toast, toast.  can we go. please. please. please.  i'll be really good.  okay, okay, okay.  first, let me do my face.   sheen: wow.  cindy's plant is awesome.   hey, if you want awesome, check out my 64millionyearold plant.   cindy's plant is great.  check out the colors.  that's pretty. that's cool.  where'd you get that from. wow.  ah, hey, guys, come on.  what aboutmyplant.  no offense, jimmy, but does your plant smell like a...  : dead rat.  it's 64millionyearold spinach.  what's it supposed to smell like, perfume.  wow. jimmy...  look at cindy's plant.  it's huge and colorful.   jimmy: well, so what.  she overwatered it.  carl, you're not seriously more interested in cindy's plant than in my 64millionyearold spinach.  : of course not, jim.  uh, huh, uh...  oh, look, my shoelace is untied...  over there.  oh, electromagnetic radiation multiplier.  hieroglyphic translator.  extra homework.  ha, ha, here it is.  my dna accelerator.  cindy, your flower is as beautiful as, well...  jimmy's is smelly and unexciting.  thank you, miss fowl.  since it's so beautiful and fragrant i thought i'd call it the "miss fowl flower." : i'll give you a flower.  advance dna by 350 million years.  and so, class, that concludes my modest presentation.  yeah. yay. yeah.   yay.  top that, p.t. boredom.  64 million bc, a huge sauropod gruesomely chews his evening meal.  stuck unnoticed between hismassivebicuspids is a piece of spinach.    : oops.  huh.   : i remember my first toaster.  a sondergaard browner deluxe with gleaming chrome tail fins and that extralarge slot to accommodate the bagels and such.  oh, boys and their toasters.   and so you see my plant is no mere pigmentary odditylike cindy's.  it required a thorough knowledge of morphology, psychology and histology.  to say nothing of...  oh, feeling funny.  room spinning.   bah...   so, uh, uh, that's my project.  any questions. no. okay, good, bye.   okay, where is he.  you know darn well "who" and "where" and "is" and "he." jimmy neutron, spoilerofanyone'sglory whosebotanyprojectisbetterthanhis.  uh, do you have a photograph to aid in our search for him.   when you see him, tell him i've gotproof that he's responsible for whatever's happening to miss fowl.  : thanks, guys.  hey, look, jimmy was in the stall the whole time.  yeah, i think you're in trouble.  wwell, it's not my fault my plant mutated a seedpod launcher for transpecies propagation.  nobody could've predicted that.  yeah. well, it's lunchtime.  i've got to go.  carl, you have to help me keep miss fowl in class until i figure out how to reverse my dna ray.   okay...  plan "b." goddard, emergency.   meet me downtown with my screwdriver and my special cd of townsaving music.  no truck driving in the hallway.  man: general abercrombie.  we've got a report of a 50foot green woman marauding through retroville, sir.  thank you, captain, but i'm looking for a shorter woman.  one who enjoysong strolls in the park and yodeling to the oldies.  she's not looking for a date, sir.  she's terrorizing the town.  is there a difference.  ha, ha, ha. little levity.  call in the military.  we are the military, sir.  boy, we got here fast.  we better do something, right.  should i scramble the jets, general.  no, thanks. i'll just have a muffin and some coffee.   confiscate.  must confiscate.     i'll take this roof, young man.  you can have it back after class.  drop the toaster and run for your life.  aah, but i want to see the big lady.  and it's not just a toaster.  it does waffles, too.  hugh.  attention, giant woman.  if you do not stop being 50feet tall immediately we're going to fire our boomboom pointy things at you missing you initially, but then we're going to...   holy cow.  it's winifred fowl.   is that you ernest abercrombie.  where's your homework.  it's 28 years overdue.     listen to her roar of terror.  no, that's my stomach.  i never ate lunch, remember.  oh, yeah.  there you are, goddard.  general.  this is jimmy neutron.  if you hold your fire i might be able to shrink her back to size.  roger, bigheaded kid.  i've reversed the ray, but the battery's weakening.  i'll have to use my jet pack to get close.  goddard, townsaving music.   no passing notes in class.   sorry, miss fowl.  this is for your own good.   puking pluto, the ray's still not strong enough.  hey...  the new xk41.  dad.  throw me your toaster.  but toast... hugh...  my toaster. mine.  give.... don't.... give it....   oh.  thanks, boy.  i need a clear shot at mouth.  miss fowl, look. i'm chewing gum.  gum.  gum.     carl: all right, jim.  you did it, buddy.  if you think you're going to be the hero here, neutron you are sadly mistaken.  these seedpods from your plant prove that you are responsible for this whole thing.  ah, finally, lunch.  no.  mmm, oh, these are, mmm...   whoa... carl's huge.  hey...  hey, this is kind of cool.  : i can see my house from here.  i can fix him.  i just need to get another toaster.  uhhuh.  and you guys need to, uh...  get that dna ray out of miss fowl's stomach.  good luck. see ya. bye.  we have to what.  you heard him.  we have to make our teacher toss the lunch monkey.  we need a bucket, an umbrella and whatever they were serving for lunch in the cafeteria on thursday.  goddard, hit it.   captioned bymedia access group
