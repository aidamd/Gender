 london.  huh, i wonder where mom is.  forget her.  i'm gonna go talk to this cutie.  hello.  hi, zack.  ahh.  wow, mom, that is quite the getup.  oh, honey, you're practicingyour japanese bow.  i think i'm gonna throw up.  oh, guys, i have missed you so much.  carey, are you ready to start the commercial.  just about.  hashimoto, i want you to meet my sons.   what's up.  i'm zack.  boys, this is the president of the hashimoto beverage corporation, the man i was telling you about.  taken withher.  i am honored to have you visit my studio.   is this a gekkozan costume.  hai,the original.  they shot "gekkozan versus hamstra" on this stage.  no way.  you know, i love the part where gekkozan attacks hamstra's lair and the giant wheel breaks loose and rolls right over the emperor.  oh, well done.  come, it looks like your lovely mother is ready to begin.  okay, all you have to do is say "hashimoto soda," open bottle, drink soda, ..   that means " then hold hand to face and giggle like a schoolgirl.   easy enough.  let's do this.   hashimoto:action.  hashimoto soda.    i was hoping for a big smile.  it tastes, uh, kind of fishy.  i would hope so.  it's shrimp flavor.  you put shrimp in soda.  not whole thing.  just legs, eyes, antennae and butts.  i didn't even know shrimp had butts.  let's go again.  hashimoto: take #57.  hashimoto soda.   cut.   eh, i'm gonna go look around.  can't i just fake it using lemonade.  absolutely not.  that would be deceptive.  hashimotosan, give me a sec with the talent.  okay, mom, here's the trick: much of the sensation of taste actually comes from smell.  so if you breathe through your mouth instead of your nose, you can eat something really disgusting.  how do you know that.  i grew up with your cooking.  this thing is awesome.   action.  hashimoto soda.     ahh.  please clear the stage.  i can't see.  ahh.   next.  okay, woody, the key to wrestling a bigger opponent is to get balance.  what do you know about wrestling.  you're looking at kettlecorn's threetime junior miss steer wrestling champion.  ahh.    what if i can't get him off balance.  well, then just jump in the barrel and wait for the clown.  that's all i got.  our next victimuh, challenger is  no no no, not me.  i'm the host.  oh sorry, lady.  our next challenger is woody fink.  all right.  you're up, cowboy.   git git.  okay okay.   nice cow.   ahh.    bad cow.  ahh.  woody, grab him by the horns.  right.  i think he shaved his horns.   ooh.  next.  woody.  you're still alive.  yes.  i won the gold pass.  woody, you did it.  your b.o. caused a k.o.  yeah.  no no.  hashimoto: what have you done to my studio.  you have brought great shame to your family.  it's not the first time.  you must pay for damage.  that camera cost one million yen.  but i have no yen.  i'm yenniless.  come on, can't you let us off the hook.  after all, you are taken with me.  wastaken with you.  once you see lady spew like mount fuji, bloom kind of off cherry blossom.  you three must pay off debt.  cool, we're gonna be in a commercial.  not commercial.  you three will be tasters in soda lab.  more shrimp.  you will taste more than 1,000 flavors, starting with lobster poop.  but i don't wanna drink soda poop.  thanks for the spa day, woody.  i've never been in a mudbath without pigs slopping around in it.  oh, no problem.  i'm happy to spread the gold pass love around ..  and whoever these people are.  woody, the ocean called and it's out of shrimp.  see. nothing.  unlimited.  anyway, you're making plenty of money with those snack machines you're putting everywhere.  london: hahahachoo.  bless you.  thank you.  and why does this snack machine have gold uhoh.  london.  no no no no.  you can't avoid the dentist forever.  oh, just watch me.  woody, i'm very upset that you've defeated me in the sumo ring.     oh, there there.  what's the matter, mikio.  i lost to outofshape gaijin.  you're calling me out of shape.  you're not exactly a beanpole.  i've brought great dishonor to my family.  i can never face them again.  oh, don't cry.  do something.  i don't wanna.   oh.  make him stop.  okay fine.  mikio.   with sweet potato fries.  whatever you want, big guy.  oh.   london, where did you go.  aha.  i've got you.   oh dear.   sucker.   are these blindfolds really necessary.  absolutely.  no one can see secret formula of hashimoto soda.  what's the point of this.  we're not going to like any of these flavors.  oh, i know.  i just need to make sure none are fatal.  and using humans stops animal rights people from getting all up in my grill.  you taste the soda and you rate on a scale of one to 10.    oh, is this my bed.  uh, wellit is now.   dude, that reeks.  oh, my eyesi think they're melting.   hey, guys.  mikio, i see you're settling in.  see.  aren't you bothered by the smell.  smells like planting season back home.   mikio, i brought you a welcome basket.   mm.  he likes it.  he's eating part of the basket.   where's bathroom.  oh.   nature's shouting.   oh, woody, it is so sweet of you to take in mikio.  he's such a nice guy.  nice.  it's like living with 10 of me.  i don't even know what cody's gonna say when he meets our new roommate.  oh, please take a video.  when do you think he'll be ready to go home.  uh, never.  i mean, the poor guy lost face.  well, we need to find his face and fast because the other end of him is stinking up my room.  the only way his honor would be restored let him beat you in a real sumo match.  whoa whoa whoa.  whoa.  if i lose, moseby might take away my gold pass.    oh oh.  okay.  you know what.  i can live without it.  okay.  oh.  oh, that was the worst one yet.  tastes like goat feet.  the throwup is starting to taste better than the soda.  oh.  don't give him that'll be the next flavor.  mm.  zack, what are you eating.  uh, soda.   you are not.  you had a peanut butter sandwich in your pocket.  it's probably been there for months.  i don't care.  i need something to get this taste out of my mouth.  give me.  no, it's my sandwich.  guys, stop it.  okay, look, we're gonna get outta here.  i'm sure they're watching us.  yes, but thanks to years of tympanic exercise and regular wax removal, i have a very acute sense of hearing.  by counting footsteps and calculating vocal trajectories, i've been able to paint an exact mental picture of this room.  good job, cody.  i knew i could count on you.  we're in a triangular room made entirely of glass.  now to the right is a spiral staircase with travertine marble steps.  right now hashimoto is at the mixing table in the far corner of the room.  okay, follow me.  we're going to the exit.  now it's exactly 12 paces away.  one, toh.  ahh.  where do you think you're going.  hey, cody, let's see if your finelytuned ears can hear this.  you're an idiot.  that's it.  you can't keep the three of us here.  yeah.  it's zack's fault, so just keep him.  yeah.  wait. what.  you have taken your blindfolds off.  mine's stuck.  now i definitely cannot let you leave.  you have seen my secret ingredients.  it's all labeled in japanese.  i don't even know what this stuff is.  wow.  is that the rare thelenota rubrolineata found off the coast of the solomon islands, you.  cody, why can't you be dumb like your brother.  you know what.  we're getting out of here and you can't stop us.  come on, mom.  maybe i can't, but they can.   hah.  why'd you take the elevator.  not very impressive.  get them.    ladiesbring  welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to a ring match of epic proportionalism and excitillating fantastitude: the brawler on the trawler.  please welcome our challenger, weighing in at 347 lbs, the samurai of smoosh, the crusher from kyoto: mikio takewaki.   rahr.  rahr.   and now, ..  mm mm mm.  ...substantially less than the challenger, the oaf from ohio, the buffoon ..  hurtful.  ...the tipton sumo challenge champion: woody fink.   now remember, let mikio win, but make it look real.  i'll try, but my skunklike powers make me invincible.  don't worry.  i came prepared.  what's that.  deodorant.  what's that.  oh.    stop it.  it tickles.  okay, now go out there and lose.  moseby: gentlemen, the first person to knock his opponent out of the ring wins.  and now let's see some sumo.   oh, it's working.  uhoh, it's working.  ahh.  crowd:ooh.  and mikio is the winner.  ooh.  oh yay, mikio.   who got his face back.  meanwhile, my face is broken in nine places.  i'll get the first aid kit.  don't move.  .. london.   nope, it's just us bandages.   uhoh.  you look ridiculous.  well, at least my hair didn't explode.  that's it, i am taking you to the dentist right now.  no.  come on. come on.  while you're there, ask him if he could fix these.  this knot's really stubborn.  what's going on.  whahh.  uh.  zack. zack.  zack. cody.  wait, what this peanut butter and jellyfish soda is delicious.  it is.   how could i not have thought of this combination before.  i am going to be richer than the emperor.  i'm going to be richer than oprah.  whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.  slow your sushi roll.  what do you mean you're going to be rich.  i put the peanut butter in the jellyfish.  well, i put the jellyfish in the peanut butter.  no you didn't.  okay, i didn't.  but no one tells hashimoto what to do except mrs. hashimoto.  you're married.  youi was talking about mommy.  you can't steal the recipe.  now you said yourself you were a man of great honor and integrity.  okay.  how about i buy rights to your soda recipe by forgiving your debt.  you owe me nothing.  yeah.  thank you.  we will take the deal.  ahem.  thank you.  okay. come on, boys.  we're getting outta here.  carey, those are not your sons.  oh, i know. )
