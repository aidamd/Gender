bowling.  i am. my average is 225.  good. is that good.  it's fantastic.  when we were on the road, i was always looking for something to do with the boys, and every town has a bowling alley.  are we going to bowl, or are we just going to do the chattychat.  ho, ho.  we're bowling.   esteban.  you're facing the wrong way.  oh, this the way we do it in my country.  well, that's the dumbest thing i've ever heard.  why don't youwelcome to the team.  cody, have you seen arwin.  i asked him if he wanted to come bowling.  what did he say.   zack, you're up.   zack, you really are good.  tip of the iceberg, baby.  carey.  i think we have a pretty decent team except for one glaring weakness.  oh, i got a split.  and i've decided to name you captain.  well, you are the mother of our star bowler, and you're pretty good yourself.  and you want me to tell london she's off the team.  and you're quick as a whip.  good luck with that.  so, london, we've got our team set.  oh, goody. tell me about me.  shh. this is a team secret.   you get to be our alternate.  is that good.  good.  it's great.  it means that if somebody else can't bowl, you get to be our secret weapon.  ohh.  well, can i still wear my cheerleading outfit.  you can wear whatever you want.  yay, me.  shh. shh.   yay, me.  won't you throw the ball.  oh, is the little dutch boys the best you can do.  spying on us.  i don't need

because you're doing your own stinkin' homework.  fine, fine, fine.  but if i pull a finger muscle, it's on your head.  well, it's better than where it usually is, up your nose digging for gold.  that's funny.  hey, check it out.  there's some loser in the hall in a towel.  no way. who is it.  you.  uhh.  hey, let me in.  zack.  can't believe you fell for it again.  he did it differently this

learning experience.  and you've learned nothing.  i'd go with no allowance.  that and i'm grounding you for the month.  what.  you are not to leave this hotel, except for school.  but what about the bowling tournament tomorrow.  you'll let me out of grounding for that, won't you.  grounding doesn't have exceptions except for school.  but the team needs me.  well, you should have thought of that before you disobeyed me.  ..  you're the captain of the team.  how can you fire your star player.  because i'm your mom first.  you're off the team. that's final.  to cody" on abc kids.  .  .

been a halloffamer ..  but what.  ..  that night.  this was the national finals, and first place meant money, product endorsements, and chickschicks who dig professional bowlers.  ahh.  those were the days.  anyway, mother had never seen me bowl before, but her armwrestling match got postponed.  so, she came to support me in the finals, as only a mother can.  mother: arwin. come on. do it.  try and make something out of yourself.  don't be a loser like your father.  mom was giving me a pep talk from the sidelines.  mother: you better win.  i was under a lot of pressure.  zack: what happened.  my hand was sweating so much that i lost it on the back swing.   mother: aah.  ugh.  i lost the match.  ..  she lost a foot.  oh, my gosh.  does she walk with a limp.  the ball actually landed on her head.  she lost a foot.  she was 6 feet, now she's 5 feet.  that math i can do.  ..  ..  i haven't bowled since.  arwin, if you're a good bowler, you could take my place in the match against the st. mark hotel.  our team needs you.  no, no, no. i can't.  sure you can. no, no, no. i can't.  i swore i would never pick up a bowling ball again.  arwin, facing your fears helps you grow as a person.  ..  i don't know if you've noticed, but, uh, i'm a grown man without a girlfriend living in a basement.  facing my fears isn't exactly my forte.  please.  i really messed up and let the team down.  mark, everyone is going to hate me.  bummer.  i'm pretty sure if we won, mom would give you a kiss.  let's bowl.  to cody" on abc kids.  .  .   .  . ba da ba ba ba .  to cody" on abc kids.  you vill

you wouldn't let some stupid punishment keep you from the tournament.  ahem.  do i have to ground you, too.  i'm not going to lift zack's punishment, whether we're losing or not.  that's good parenting.  oh, thanks.  i'm not here to bowl.  arwin is.  arwin. you bowl.  i'm, uh, sort of a champion.  why didn't you tell us.  are we bowling or vhat.   ve have a last minutewe have a lastminute
