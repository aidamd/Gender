 almost as funnyas this morning when codygot so scared.  i wasn't scared.  you were whiteas a sheet.   don't tell meyou saw the ghost in suite 613.  there's a ghost in the hotel.  yeah. cool.  let's go see it.  uh, maybe later.  what's the matter.  afraid.  ..  you're supposed to wait an hour before you dive into the supernatural.  there's no such thing as ghosts.  wrong, as usual.  i've seen this ghost.  it was so scary, ..  and left it there.  with money in it.  oh, just the regular $1,000 bill every kid gets for an allowance.  hey.  'just 'cause i don't need it doesn't mean it's not mine.  hey, watch it.  i got 3 clock radios and a dvd player hidden in here.  muriel, where is suite 613.  over there.  but if you value your life, don't go in there.  let's go in.  unh. let's not.  on second thought, here's the key.  told you there was a ghost.  her name was irene, and she was beautiful and rich.  ..  ..  ..  and dead.  as i was saying, in 1942, irene and her husband checked in on their honeymoon night ..  he went off to war.  she waited 3 years. but he never came back.  so he died in battle.  hehe met some italian babe and opened up a pizza parlor in naples.   irene was so angry, she threw the silver hairbrush he had given her at the mirror.  and the mirror shattered, and a shard flew out, and that was the end of that.  good luck.  come on.  aah. aah. aah. aah.  oh, oh, sorry. leg cramp.  ..  why are you walking around the hotel wearing a welding mask.  it gives me an air of mystery.   the force is strong with this one.  have you ever seen the ghost.  ..  i have seen muriel in a hair net.   ooh.  now if you'll excuse me, ..  the toilet in 620.   coming, mother.  i can't get it open.  what a shame. let's go.   it's the ghost.  no.  no.  stop.  aah.  we obviously loosened the lock, and the wind opened it up.   zach: wow.  is that her.  yeah. that's the ghost of suite 613.   check out the broken mirror.  check out the gargoyles.  check out of this room.  cody, they're just statues.  they put them there to ward off evil.  even the guy who designed this hotel knew it was haunted.   it's cody's teeth.   cody, trust me.  there is no ghost here causing weird things to happen.   aah. aah.  welcome back.  there is no ghost.   but i do see a purse.  whoo hoo.  finders, keepers. losers, weepers.  hand me the loot or you get the boot.   the ghost stole my money.  she is so dead.   what's that sound.  it's a ghost.  rry about the whole dead thing.  london. save me.  unh.  aah. aah. aah. aah.  thank you.  i will bill you for the hearing aid i now require.  i could hear you screaming from the lobby.  mr. moseby, have you ever seen the ghost.  there is no ghost. told you.  now let's leave before she gets annoyed.   and i'm completely alone here.  tell us about the ghost ..  ..  when people are checking in.  very well.  it was a long time ago.  i had just started working at the tipton as a bell hop.  it was a dark and stormy night, and i was working diligently.   oh, man.  i gotta catch me some z's. oh.  mr. moseby, narrating: i had heard rumors about room 613.  but i didn't believe in ghosts.  ..   followed by an overpowering aroma of pizza.  mmm, pizza. i could dig a slice.  irene: i hate pizza.  it reminds me of my unfaithful husband.  aah.  yo, man, i didn't mean a slice of me.   oh.  mr. moseby, narrating: fortunately, my voluminous fro ..  phew.  although i did injure my ankle.  i was never able to boogie oogie oogie again.  aah.  aah. aah. aah. aah.  oh.  that was awesome.  you should have seen your faces. oh, wait.  i can show you your face.  let's see what my hand looks like when it squishes your face.  i wasn't scared.  if you weren't scared, why were you shaking in the elevator.  because it hasn't been inspected in 3 years.  don't you read that little card.  well, i wanna see the ghost.  so i dare you to spend the night with me in suite 613.  5 bucks say you run out first.  ..  but mom will never let us do it.  darn right i won't. do what.  camp out tonight in suite 613.  otherwise known as the haunted room.  ..  we a your wise and carefully considered decision.  you just don't wanna go because you're chicken.  she said "no," and no means no, mister.  don't make her say it again.   ..  no brother clucking.  ..can we go.  i don't think so.  what if we got maddie and london to stay with us.  well, i guess that would be ok.  you know, you don't have to give in to him.  what kind of mother are you.  cody, you do whatever you want.  but there's no such thing as ghosts.  if there were, my motherinlaw would still be haunting me.  so you gonna spend the night fingerpainting with mommy.  no. i'm gonna spend the night in suite 613.  then when you run out first, i'm gonna spend your 5 bucks.  we'll see about that.   london said she'd meet us here with the pass key.  she just had to pick up a few things.  sorry i'm late. it's esteban's fault.  yes. my hernia. my fault.  i thought you said you were going to rough it.  i only brought my overnight bag.  please forgive me for delaying our spooky yet fun adventure with ghosties.  here's the key.  here goes nothing.  here goes my lower back.   this isn't so scary.   ok, now it is.   it's the ghost.  all: aah.  and it's holding a club.  and now it's eating the club.  it's not a club. it's a sub.  meatball marinara. you want some.  aah.  what's so scary about a sandwich.  the guy who's eating it.  i just think you're kinda creepy. no offense.  none taken. a lot of women say that.  including mother.  see. the ghost didn't knock out the lights.  the storm did.  right, arwin.  no. it was the ghost.  again, i'm alone.  but tonight, tonight is my golden opportunity.  why, because the lightning provides sufficient atmospheric ozone allowing your instrument to pick up any ectoplasmic manifestations.  no, because mother's at bingo, and i don't have to be home till 10:00.  ha ha ha. )
