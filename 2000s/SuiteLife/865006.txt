in our supercomfy waiting area.  i'm telling you all these games are rigged.  let's fa itif you want something, you're gonna have to buy it.  let's go shopping, elma fudd.  hey, cody, get the camera.  why.  want to take a picture in front of our viking forefathers.  naw, i want to get a shot of your frozen puke.  it's gonna be here till, like, june.  valkommento martensgrav.  i hope you are enjoying the festival.  ja.  i'm ragnar, the mayor of martensgrav.  ah, pleasure to meet you.  i'm cody, and this is my brother zack.  it just so happens that we are descendants of knut and olaf here.  you are martens.  yeah, can't you tell from my chiseled viking features.  no.  but since you're martens, we would be honored if you two would participate in the annualfishenflagen.   fishenflagen.  i wonder if that hot girl dorta will be there, huh.  you mean my daughter dorta.  and by hot, i meant that she looks slightly feverish.  you might want to shove her into a snowbank.  he means we would be delighted to participate, mr. mayor.  wonderful.  people of martensgrav, as you know, we normally conduct the fishenflagen with the statues, but today we are honored to have actual martens.   thank you, all.  it is an honor to be here representing our family and thank you for including us in your festival.  let the fishenflagen begin.  why are they throwing herring at us.  at least it's not the swordfish festival.  ah.  finally done.  ow, i think my legs have fallen asleep.  oh yeah, they have.     six.  .  no, wait.   seven.  i'm five.  what happened to five.  eight.  eight.  get the thing.  nine.  nine. nine.  how may i help you.  i just finished filling out your stunninglydetailed parts request form.   oooh, time for lunch.  what do you mean "loonch".  that's a "boonch" of malarkey.  we've been waiting here for hours.  aw, forget it, mr. moseby.  life is too short.  can't you just buy another nightstand.  of course i can, but i won't.  it's the principle of the thing.  but i want to go to the abba museum.  oh, ja ja, you should.  it's wonderful.  well, i'll be back in an hour.  please feel free ..  comfy waiting area.  you hear that.  we got an hour.  come on, let's go to the museum.  what. no.  that barely gives us enough time to get through the platform shoe pavilion.  let's go across the street to thesurstrommingrestaurant.  you like fermented herring.  heck no.  but they got real chairs.  ahhh.  i smell like shamu's urinal.  at least it's over.   that fishenflagen was fun.  .  sorry, guys.  it was crowded.  we wouldn't have thrown them if we'd known it was you.  even if it was fun.   boys, that was just wonderful.  oh, i'm glad you enjoyed it.  oh, we did.  it's much more fun having real martens here.  when you throw herring at the statues, they don't shriek like little girls.  look, you have no right to treat us like this.  this town is named after our ancestors.  ja, and your ancestors almost ruined this town.   it was a bitterly cold night.  knut and olaf were supposed to be guarding the town's herring catch.  hey, knut.  this saga of leif ericson is just wonderful.  it talks of a huge  olaf.  you make me laugh.  everyone knows if you go west you fall off the world.  you must be from faloon, because you got me "faloon" head over heels.  eyes on the herring, not on me.   so while olaf was busy reading, and knut was striking out with my greatgreatgreatgreatgrandmother, a scandinavian brown bear crept up and stole the town's entire herring catch.  the town nearly starved and the martens' name has been reviled ever since.  oh, that's ridiculous.  we all know bears don't eat fish.  they eat jars of honey and hang out with tigers and piglets.   if it weren't for ragnar i heroically tracking down the bear and returning the herring, this town would have starved to death.  people of martensgrav, knut and olaf have let us down, but i, ragnar the brave, have saved the day.  now let's put them on a longship and shove them off the end of the earth.  crowd: yeah.  ewww.  ow, my helmet.  ow, my back.  but here you are, so i guess that proves the earth is round.  hey, eric, i owe you 20 kroner.  it kinda happened a long time ago.  can't you just let it go.  no, i can't.  this is a claw from the thieving bear. been passed down through generations of my family.  i keep it as a reminder of that night.  plus it's good for opening bottles.   let's just get the stupid screw and go to the abba museum.  mamma mia.  number 37.  so while i was in the shower, i was thinking about ragnar's story, and something seemed fishy.  are you sure that wasn't the smell of your hair.  all right, cody, just forget the whole thing.  look, they're serving hot chocolate.  obviously.  who would be dumb enough to order a smoothie.    is my smoothie ready.  um, how am i supposed to drink that.  easy.  smoothsicle.   ragnar said that olaf was reading the saga of leif ericson.  but leif ericson wasn't born until 970a good 50 years after knut and olaf "supposedly" lost the herring.  so.  soif that fact is wrong maybe the whole story is wrong.  we have to get back there and clear our family's name.  nothing on earth would make me go back to that herring hole.  zack, i "snook" away from my father.  i "vish" there was some way we could be together.  there will be.  as soon as i clear my family's name.  you see, i was just telling my brother that there was no way olaf could have been reading about that leafy guy because he wasn't even born until long after the herring heist.  oh, you are so schmart.   uhhuh, ja ja, the schmartest.  if only there were some record of that time.  well, there is my ancestor's diary, which my father keeps under lock and key like it's some big giant secret.  hello.  didn't it occur to you that it might actually be some big giant secret.  no, it didn't.   sometimes i'm such a dumb brunette.  help.  tongue stuck.   number 99.  dancing queen.  oh. okay, hi.  valkommento umaka, how may i help you.  if you remember i filled out the parts form.  ah.  ah ah.  oh, i am not seeing it.  all i have here is one for a woman named marion.  that woman is him.  she is me.  oh, in that case, ..  ma'am.  this should take no time at all though, ja.  thank goodness.  everything seems to be in order.  i "yust" need to know the name of your screw.  all right, the next herring chili i will judge comes from a lastminute entry from gunnel and gustava.  i'm gunnel.  and i'mthe other one.  you will like our herring chili.  ja.  i will be the judge of that.  ja.  oh, let us feed you, mr. mayor.  ooops.   sweet stellen skarsgard, that's hot.  ja.  bailey: oopsydaisy, we are so clumsy.  oh, ja.  let us clean you.  we are so clumsy.  oh, ja.  let us clean you up.  it might be the tolestorp.  but it could also be the vanersvick.  jerkface.  hey, i'm doing the best i can.  no no, that's the name of the screw i need.  jerkface.  ah, you mean the yerkafassa.  yerkafassa, okay.  one yerkafassa.   ja. ja.  ja.  we no longer make that screw.  what am i supposed to do .  ..  thethethe drawer's supposed to glide smoothly.  ja, yust yiggle it.  no no no no no.  i don't want to "yiggle" it.  i'm tired of yiggling it.  i want you to fix this stupid piece of yunk.  i mean junk.  i am so sorry.  i would love to help you but there's nothing more i can do.  okay.  i have wasted enough of my life on this.  i give up.  come on, marcus, let's get to the abba museum before it closes, hmm.  no. )
