a rocket .  . or fighting a mummy .  . or climbing up the eiffel tower .  . discovering something that doesn't exist .  . or giving a monkey a shower .  . surfing tidal waves .  . creating nanobots .  . or locating frankenstein's brain .  it's over here.  . finding a dodo bird .  . painting a continent .  . or driving your sister insane .  phineas.  . as you can see .  . there's a whole lot of stuff to do .  . before school starts this fall .  come on, perry.  . so stick with us 'cause phineas and ferb .  . are gonna do it all .  . so stick with us 'cause phineas and ferb .  . are gonna do

want to do.   well, he's a platypus. they don't do much.  i for one am starting to get bored, and boredom is something up with which i will not put.  the first thing they're gonna ask us when we get back to school is what did we do over summer.  i mean, no school for 3 months, our life should be a rollercoaster.  and i mean a good rollercoaster.  not like that one we rode at the state fair.   aah. aah. aah.  please exit to the left.  man, that was lame.  why, if i built a rollercoaster, i wouldthat's it. i know what we're gonna do today.  phineas, ferb, i'm gonna go pick up a few things.  you boys stay out of trouble, ok.  ok, mom.  we're gonna build a rollercoaster.  i'm in charge, right.  you did tell them i'm in charge.  relax, candace. nobody has to be in charge.  but what if there's an emergency.  like what.  ..  what if a satellite falls out of orbit .  if that happens, you're in charge.  yes.  mom says i'm in charge conditionally.  whatever.  wait a minute. what are you doing.  homework.  it's summer.  you wait till the last minute, then.  well, i'm watching you.  and i'm in charge.  conditionally.   hello.  oh, hi, cece.  no, i can't go to the mall right now.  mom just went to the store.  she left me in charge.  well, you know, conditionally.  oh, if you go, can you see if jeremy's there.  no, no, he's the cute one that works at mr.  slushy burger.  yeah, he totally smiled at me the last time i was there.  i just about died.  i know. i told you, i can't.  i'm watching my brother and stepbrother.  yeah, and they never get into trouble because mom never catches them.  one of these days, though, i'm gonna see to it that she catches them redhanded.   will you hold it down.  i am trying to use the phone.  mom left me in charge, so there will be no shenanigans today.  why do you ask.  what do you mean you can see it from your house.  .  phineas, what is that.  do you like it.  ooh, i'm gonna go tell mom, and when she sees what you are doing, you are going down.  down, down, down.  down. down.  we're gonna need a blowtorch and some more peanut butter.  hey, candace, is phineashome.  doom. down, i say.  hey, phineas.  whatcha doin'. hey, isabella.  building a rollercoaster.  in your backyard.  some of it.  wow. isn't that kind of impossible.  some might say.  hey, ferb.  does your stepbrother ever talk.  ferb. he's more of a man of action.  i was gonna go to the pool.  you want to go swimming.  kind of in the middle of something here.  oh. right.  ok. i'll see you later, then.  ok.  hey, ferb, you got enough rivets up there.  whew.  hey, where's perry.  i want you to get over to his hideout right away, find out what he's up to, and put a stop to it.  as always, agent p, it is imperative that your cover identity as a mindless domestic pet remains intact.  we're all counting on you.  . dooby dooby doo ba doo .  . dooby dooby doo ba doo .  . dooby dooby doo ba doo .  . dooby dooby doo ba .  so the way i see it, the solid fuel rockets kick in in the mall parking lot.  then we release the snakes during the corkscrew around the interstate.  i'm gonna go get the snakes.  mom, you've gotta come home right now.  did a satellite crash into the house.  you gotta see what phineas and ferb re doing.  it seems like we've had this conversation before.  what do you mean.  i seem to recall you telling me that the boys were training monkeys to juggle bicycles, and when i came home, there was a stunning lack of monkeys.  i still don't know how they cleaned it up so fast.  so what's the emergency this time.  they're building a rollercoaster.  candace, seriously, isn't phineas a little young to be a rollercoaster engineer.  aren't you a little young to be a rollercoaster engineer.  yes. yes, i am.  well, i must say, i'm very impressed.  the forms all seem to be in order, although i've never seen them filled out in crayon before, so if there's anything i can get you, anything at all, just, uh, let me know.  do you think we could borrow one of those gadgets.  now, this is the life.  ah, perry the platypus.  what an unexpected surprise.  and by unexpected, i mean completely expected.  heinz doofenschmirtz, have covered the entire eastern seaboard in tinfoil.  and when i put my giant magnet next to my ingenious magnetism magnifier, i will pull the east in a westerly direction, thereby reversing rotation of the earth.  you may well ask yourself,  wants me.  yes. arrested.  ..   a date.  they will need a chaperon.  i agree completely.  . good. so you'll do it.  say yes, or we're checking out.  say,

on this date.  go, go, get, get, get.  wait.  photo op.  smile.  don't they make a cute couple.  moseby: i heard that.  it's so unfair.  if cody hadn't locked me in the closet, i'dbe going out with moseby.  honey, all's fair in love and ear.  it was you.  you told him that.  this is all your fault.  i was just trying to build his confidence.  i've spent years trying to destroy it.  can we please
