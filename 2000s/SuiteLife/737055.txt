because he's not bowling.  he's been grounded, and when the team loses, it'll be all your fault.  carey, carey, carey, carey, carey.  i beg you to punish zack on a daily basis and nothing.  and now, the one time that i need him, you decide to get tough.  oh, you hate me, don't you.  reporting for jailer duty.  don't worry, carey.  i'll make sure zack doesn't have any fun.  although, we may play laser tag or somethingok, no fun.  thank you, arwin.  anything for you, carey.  mom, please.  punish me tomorrow.  good idea. i like that.  tomorrow works for us.  his punishment starts today.  i'm sorry, guys, but zack has to learn that there are rules and when you break them, there are consequences.  well, who's going to take my place.  well, london is our alternate.  you mean i'm doing the round thingy at the white thingy.  oh, yay, me.  we're doomed. esteban: uhh.  i know we have suffered a great blow with the loss of our most valuable player.  but i believe, if we all pull togetherwe couldleft. left my husband with 28 kids.  right. right.  right in the middle of the living room floor.  left, left. team halt.  i'm scared. hold me.  aah.  so, moseby, you really think you can beat us with your pathetic team of children and girlygirls.  well, we've got something that you haven't got.  team spirit.  we've got spirit. yes, we do.  how 'boutyou.  ve've got spirit. yah, we do.  shut your mouth, or i'll crush you.  back off, bertha.  oh, ze spiky hair has the backbone.  i hate ze backbone.  london, drop your pompoms.  you're up first. ok.  oh well, what am i supposed to do now.  i finished my homework.  oh, why don't you go over what you did, and, you know, review it.  ah, come on.  it's bad enough i had to do it once.  hey.  a bowling trophy.  arwin, you bowl.  no, no, no.  makes a great paperweight.  butbut it says, " that'smy sister.  it's her trophy. she won it, ahem.  she has the same first name as you.  we were a poor family.  we could only afford one name.  but itok, i confess.  oh, stop badgering me. i can't take it anymore.  it's me. it's me. it's me.   you bowl.  yeah.  i traveled the circuit, hung with the champions.  they said i could have been a halloffamer ..  but what.  ..  that night.  this was the national finals, and first place meant money, product endorsements, and chickschicks who dig professional bowlers.  ahh.  those were the days.  anyway, mother had never seen me bowl before, but her armwrestling match got postponed.  so, she came to support me in the finals, as only a mother can.  mother: arwin. come on. do it.  try and make something out of yourself.  don't be a loser like your father.  mom was giving me a pep talk from the sidelines.  mother: you better win.  i was under a lot of pressure.  zack: what happened.  my hand was sweating so much that i lost it on the back swing.   mother: aah.  ugh.  i lost the match.  ..  she lost a foot.  oh, my gosh.  does she walk with a limp.  the ball actually landed on her head.  she lost a foot.  she was 6 feet, now she's 5 feet.  that math i can do.  ..  ..  i haven't bowled since.  arwin, if you're a good bowler, you could take my place in the match against the st. mark hotel.  our team needs you.  no, no, no. i can't.  sure you can. no, no, no. i can't.  i swore i would never pick up a bowling ball again.  arwin, facing your fears helps you grow as a person.  ..  i don't know if you've noticed, but, uh, i'm a grown man without a girlfriend living in a basement.  facing my fears isn't exactly my forte.  please.  i really messed up and let the te mark, everyone is going to hate me.  bummer.  i'm pretty sure if we won, mom would give you a kiss.  let's bowl.  tonight, sweetie.  but i love chef.       what do you wantfor dinner.  chef boyardee.  boy, this stuff

you wish it was you they were carrying off instead of arwin.  well, i am easier to lift.  honey, i'm sorry you're disappointed, but you remember this feeling the next time you want to do something mean to your brother.  then next time, they'll be lifting you up.  all: arwin. arwin.  aah.  hopefully, i'll have some stronger teammates.  there's our champion.  is mother ok.  captioning made
