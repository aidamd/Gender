"missing you" diary, day two, hour three, minute... 19.  and still miss... ing...  you.  wow.  this is even more riveting than mom's video of you being potty trained.  what are you doing here.  and it better not be about that date.  no no no.  forget the date.  i realized how important this lame video thing is to you and i want to help you with it.  that's great.  get out of my room.  okay okay okay.  but i think bailey might appreciate it if you dressed up a bit.  girls like that kind of stuff.  .  let'fithat hair.  pop that zit.  no.  ..  look amazing.  ah, i do look pretty good.  you know what.  i'm sorry i doubted you.  you really are a great brother.  i do what i can.   who could that be.  beats me.  hey, guys, we're here for our date.  wow, cody, you look amazing.  that's exactly what i said.  and what a complexionexcept for that one pesky blackhead.  all right, let's go.  let's go have some fun.  easy.  you're not scrubbing a pot.  oh, just blow it out.   thank you, mae baan.  and here's your tipone peanut.  hey, london, khun yai and i are going down to the river to do some laundry.  come on or all the good rocks will be gone.  i'm not going.  and stop trying to steal my grandmother.  london, i'm not trying to steal your grammy.  you're pushing her away.  well, all she ever wants to do is play in the dirt.  maybe if you quit turning your nose up at everything, you'd find something in common with her.  mae baan, step on bailey.   okay okay.  oooh, idea.  mae baan, write this down.   yeah, you're rightyou'll remember it.  ..  oooh, surprise.  what did you do.  well, let's just call it an extreme hut makeover.  now you can live like me, khun yai.  london, this is very fancy.  but i feel out of place.  oh, not for long.  i brought in a team of stylists to give you a makeover.  .. over.  yes.  london: come on, you guys.  just want to tweak your look a teensy little bit.  i don't want to recognize her when you're done.   i love eating with chopsticks.  i could use them all the time.  me too.  well, as much fun as this has been, i have a ton of calculus homework to finish.  i love calculus.  what are we talking.  integrals, derivatives.  projective algebraic manifolds.  you wouldn't understand.  like the riemann sphere.  totally my favorite sphere.  i am captain of the oak park mathletes.   go badgers.  on second thought, i can do it before class.  okay.  yeahhhh.  you know, i got some math homework too.  maybe you can come ..  tutor me.  something tells me you already know too much.  besides, i have to go to the ladies' room.  want to come.  sure, i can study anywhere.  i meant hilary.  okay.  be right back, cody.  don't miss me too much.  don't worry.   that's it.  your wingman is bailing out.  apologize to hilary and never speak to me again.  uh uh uh uh uh.  i wouldn't leave if i were you.  well, that is, of course, if you want me to tell bailey about your little date.  you wouldn't.  i think we both know i would.  i think my grandmother's really happy about her makeover, don't you.  khun yai, you look amazing.  i look ridiculous.  too much bling.  if i wear all this in the rice paddies, i will sink to my waist in mud.  well, that's why i got you this brandnew washer and dryer.  and if you don't feel like wasting your time in the rice paddies, you can use this.  instaricecomes in a box and cooks in under a minute.  goes through you in under a minute too.  butbut you like the tv, right.  it's like magic moving pictures.  i know about the tv.  i got rid of mine because i was wasting so much time " i still cannot believe they voted off bantika.  khun yai, how can you not want any of this.  can't you see how much better it'll make your life.  my life is wonderful the way it is.  you eat crickets.  crickets are very healthy.  unless you eat the wrong one.  then you die instantly.  but, khun yaiplease.  just take it away.  this stuff was expensive.  expensive doesn't always mean better.  oh, please.  that's just something poor people tell themselves so they're not sad all the time.  no, money doesn't buy happiness.  ohthere's another one.  look, farming is a wonderful life.  it brings you closer to nature.  i hate nature.  why can't it be indoors.  okay, my point is until you learn to accept your grandmother's way of life, you'll never connect with her.  mmm, it's a little chilly out here, don't you think.  i'm a little chilly too.  brrr.  maybe you should put your arm around me.   well, actually, the proper way to fight hypothermia is to notokay.  looks like you've got a little something on your lip.  how embarrassing.  i'll go get a napkin.  allow me.  okay, stop.  i can't do this anymore.  we haven't done anything yet.  i have a boyfriend.  i'm okay with that.  i have a girlfriend.  .  not youbailey.  you're dating your dog.  she's not my dog.  she's my human girlfriend.  then why is she at obedience school.  okay, you're not getting this.  zack, the truth is i only went out with you so hilary could spend time with cody.  wwait a minute.  you'reherwingman and i'm the pathetic friend.  hilary made me do it.  she said it's in some rulebook.  the girble.  look, i'm sorry, hilary.  you're a great girl, but i'm in love.  but not with me, right.  oy.  so that video you're making is for your girlfriend.  yeah.  i'm doing the same thing for my boyfriend.  isn't being in love great.  oh, the best.  ..  so i guess this was just a big waste of time.  it doesn't have to be.  i mean, i prefer cody, buti've settled before.  i'm not anybody's second.  eh, what the heck.  london.  are you working.  yes.  but please don't tell anyone.  this is my way of saying samong dong.  huh.  you have a pickle brain.  no.  i'm just trying to say i'm sorry.  look.  i even pulled out these nasty weeds.  that's the rice.  i can't do anything right.  no wonder you wish bailey was your granddaughter and not me.  what.  are you crazy.  i love you.  you do.  of course.  just the way you are.  i don't want to change you.  and, please, don't try to change me.  my eyebrows still hurt from all that plucking.  sorry.  and sorry i messed up your rice.  that's okay.  your mother wasn't meant for farming either.  that's why she left.  well, don't take it personally, but she doesn't like to hang around anywhere very long.  but thanks to her, now i have you.  and i'll always be here for you, khun yai.  i mean, not here here, because here's, you know, ugh.  but maybe we can meet somewhere in the middle.  you know, like a threestar hotel.  deal.  deal.  so i guess i'll take all the stuff out of here.  maybe you can leave the high heels.  they are good for planting seeds, plusthey make my legs look hot.    oh, fine.  i'll get you a pair too.  but nothing is going to help those cankles.    cody, i'm home.  bailey.  oh, i missed you so much.  i missed you too.  i brought you something.  oooh, heavy.  what could it be.  i wrapped it.  a rock.  aa rock.  wow.  it's from the chao phraya river.  now you can stop complaining about the ship's laundry and wash your clothes in the sink.  oooh, a laundry rock.  there's even a smooth side for delicates.  thanks, bailey.  you're welcome.  oh, i have something for you too.  i was working on it the whole time you were gone.  oooh.  okay.  press play.   cody.  why am i watching a video of you being potty trained.   that's the wrong tape.  zack.  oookay, gimme that back.  gimme that back.  but it's so cute.  hello.  i'm london tipton.  welcome to the boardroom.  london, this is a classroom, not a boardroom.  then why am i always bored

asked me to think of a product that will appeal to the youth demographic.  but after putting on my thinking cap, i realized two things: i'm not a thinker, i look great in caps and i have no idea what "demographic" means.  that's three things.  oh, you're right.  stupid thinking cap.   i don't want daddy to know i couldn't come up with anything, so i need you guys to help me.  the first person to come up with a great new product gets the $1 million to develop it.   man, that's a lot of money.  you know, i can keep my eyes on it for you.  london:oh, please.  i've got a trained professional.
