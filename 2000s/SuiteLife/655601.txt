  hello, there. i'm zack martin.  you know, i'm having trouble trying to decide who is cuter, you or the dolphin.  i'm nellie.  nellie... nellie, so, what do you do around here besides, you know, look amazing.  i'm a lab tech. your brother cody is doing an internship here, right.  are you as smart as he is.  smarter. you know, i recently posted the highest score ever on kangaroo kaboom.  so, can you operate that.  oh. let's find out.  cody, out of 2,000 applicants, your paper was the most intriguing.  i almost sent a duplicate in latin, to show diversity.  i should have. i never listen to that voice in my head.  mostly because it's in latin.  well. a brilliant essay. "theories of communicating with another species, "or what it's like to have a twin brother." the culmination of a lifetime of unwilling research.  i know just how you feel. i have a lesser twin myself.  i think you'll be inspired by the research we're working on.  i'm just inspired that you iron your tie.  oh. me, too. i iron my pocket hankie.  no one cares. okay.  sir, i can't wait to see what other wonders will unfold.  well, i've discovered a rare fruit, that, when combined with the dna of these jellyfish, could enable dolphins to telepathically communicate with us, making our two worlds one.  do you know what this means.  that we can talk to dolphins.  i'm sorry, was that not clear.  it waslear. just very strange.  no, it isn't. this could change the world.  just imagine it, cody. by feeding dolphins this substance, we could potentially teach them about humanity and science, and they could teach us about...   follow me.  zack.  this is so exciting. i have so many questions.  as would zack, if he were here.  not here.  zack's not here.  no, he is not.  so, why don't i take a casual, nonchalant little stroll to see if i can locate the harmless little lad.   i'll just be right...  here they are.  obviously, we use dolphins because they are incredibly intelligent.    except wally.  the closer the research comes to its conclusion, the more i know that they want it as much as we do.  and exactly how close are you.  just really good friends. why. what have you heard.  i meant, with the research.  i know. i mean, i knew that was what you were...  there are a series of steps to converging our minds with dolphins.  but i know you'll be a vital part of our work here.  sir, i'm honored that you've put such trust in me.  just one thing. yes.  can i have a name tag.  how's that.  here you go.  and it's laminated.  did it myself.  these are the most technically advanced submersibles in the world.  why don't you get in and get a feel for it.   zack martin, get out of there this second.  don't worry. i'm not gonna do anything, uh...   like that.  what did you do.  i don't know. i just pressed this thingamajig and played with this hooziemawhats, and flipped the lever that said "start." that explains it.  i insist you cease and desist.  okay, fine. i can unpress them all.  don't unpress. press was bad.  unpress, even worse than press.  well, i guess we could find out.    so, it's my understanding that you graduated from yale.  with top honors.  i know.  how. i did a little research of my own.  well, now, yale is begging me for my research.  uhhuh.  mmmhmm. yes.  well, and harvard, and princeton, and quite a few community colleges.   and one vocational school.  as well they should.    well, you know, not to brag, but do you know what the other researchers call me.  idiot.  no. well, not to my face.  not you, sir. him.   oh, no.  zack. get out of there. can you hear me.  oh, cody. what are you doing.  cody: what are you doing.  turn around and go back now.  sure, that would be the not fun option.  cody: zack.  zack: that's sea captain zack to you.  whoa.  cody: turn around.  do something. stop them.  cody: you don't know what you're doing.  zack: you don't know what you're doing.  sea wall. of course i see the wall.  it's a big glass wall.   you're heading towards the sea wall.    if that sea wall goes, you'll be sucked out to sea.  eject.  no, you're a reject.  not reject, you, reject. eject.  wall.   eject. eject.  spaulding: eject now. the red button.   zack: okay...  some of you may look at this tank as half empty, but it's more like a quarter.  dr. spaulding, i can explain.  tinct chattering)  is that a dolphin.  fired. fired from my internship.  there goes my scholarship to yale.  and my girlfriend won't even talk to me.  it's all your fault, zack.  hey, hey, hey, i totally understand that you feel the need to put the blame on anyon that was my one shot, zack.  look, it looks bad now.  but we're going to look back at this and laugh.  and remember, "he who laughs last, thinks the slowest." this wasn't like all the other times you messed up.  this affects my whole my future.  that's unforgivable.  hey, i didn't mean to.  you never mean to do it, zack. you just do it.  i'll never forgive you for this. ever.  i hate you.  that's harsh.  i'm done, man. we're through.  we may be twins, but we are not brothers.  did i do a good job, sir.  bailey: cody and i were supposed to spend spring break together, and he went off to do something that just he wanted.  oh, that is sad.  you want to count my money.  you can't have it, but you can count it.   oh.  ha. it's cody. again.  so, answer him.  are you kidding. and let him off that easy.  no, think again.  okay, i'll try.   you know, cody hurt me.  he abandoned me.  and now, he needs to know what it feels like to be ignored.  i'm sorry, what.  cody won't hear from me until he's so worried he's trembling like a hound dog pushing out a peach pit.  ha. i am woman, hear me ignore.  i'm sorry, what.   oh, thanks. they're arturo vitali.  they're made from eel skin.  i hope they're not anybody you know.   cody, there you are.  go away.  didn't you get my email about me constructing my emotional borders forbidding you from entering the country that is my soul.  all your emails go directly to trash.  besides, i think you're gonna cheer up once you see who i've found.  good day, mr. martin.  dr. spaulding. yes.  what are you doing here.  well, although there is no chance you'll ever work for me again, ever, in this, or in any parallel universe, there is another internship that i think you're right for.  are you serious. don't toy with me now.  i'm fragile and broken.  no, i'm quite serious.  it would be a shame to see your talents go to waste.  sir, you don't know how much this means to me, just getting a second chance.  well, the gemini project, about 50 miles from us, is an isolated science camp doing research similar to ours, but on twins.  i'm a twin. the superior twin. yes.  it's true. i'm proof.  you certainly are.  well, i sent your application paper to the scientist who runs it, dr. olsen.  he was quite excited.  there's just one thing.  anything. i'll do anything.  well, because the work dr. olsen is doing is on twins, you and your brother would need to attend.   just not that thing.   that is dr. olsen's one requirement.  after reading your paper, he thinks that you could be the ideal twins to participate in his research.  me and zack. in a lab.  hey, it's not like i'm just some idiot who doesn't know anything about science.  oh, yeah. what's matter.  nothing. what's the matter with you.  see. see.  i can't go anywhere with him.  yeah. well, i don't wanna go anywhere with you first.  and when i get there, you're not welcome.  ouch.  well, that is a shame.   you know, this internship could help you qualify for a scholarsp to yale.  it would.  cody, are you really going to let your anger towards your brother jeopardize your entire future.   is this oh, it was.  cody, next time you throw up, at least tell me so i can grab my camera.  oh, i love you, dock.  oh. mmm.  you must be the martin twins, zack and cody.  oh, hi. i'm cody.  it's an honor to meet you, dr. olsen.  i know. come on, i have so much to show you.  come on, don't dawdle.  come on.   let me help you with that.  oh, it's really heavy. watch out.  yeah. this way.  i think you're both gonna see that this is someplace very special.  i'll say.  cody: this facility is fantastic.  this was actually an abandoned mill complex.  the actual sawmill is on the other side of the lake.  we're anning on renovating it.  i have two words for you that might change your life.  hot. tub.  there you go. my contribution to science.  now, i must warn you. my brother's idea of research is discovering how to simultaneously burp and sneeze.  i can almost do it without my eyes popping out.  you must be very proud.  welcome to the most advanced subterranean neuroscientific laboratory on earth.  gentlemen, i give you the gemini project.  it kind of just looks like a giant basem so, you don't think it's too much.  well, it doesn't really scream "science." 'cause i decorated it myself.  is that the hydroisotope caloubometer, capable of reading the undetectable electrical charges in a miniscule brain wave.  yes. isn't she beautiful.  oh, i love her.   oh. shh.  baby, don't speak.  cody, come, come, this way. i have to show you this.  this is my mind transference facilitator.  every apparatus in this shangrila of science...  it's astounding.  what's this.  uh, that's a cappuccino machine.  dibs on this.  and dibs on these.  hey, hey, nellie.  nellie. i'm zack. remember me.  i crashed that trillion dollar sub.  kind of a legend in the science world.  hello, zack. this is my sister, kellie.  we sometimes help dr. spaulding with his work as well.  since the research is so similar.  so, what exactly are you working on.  my colleague, dr. spaulding, is developing a substance that will allow dolphins to communicate with humans telepathically.  it's noble, sure, it's noble, but my goal is to use it to perfect communication between humans.  for what result.  imagine. if we could connect with each other's minds, we'd actually be able to feel what others feel.  and where there's more empathy between people, there's less conflict.  so you chose zack and me because we have conflict.  exactly. now, initially my research was on twins because of your similar dna, but it's progressed far beyond that.  if i can resolve the irresolvable conflicts between twins such as yourselves, i can expand that to all mankind, and create a world free of fighting, and anger, and aggression.  well, that'll make hockey fun.  perhaps it will be better if i show you.  so, why am i wired up to this thing again.  i need to establish a baseline for your brain processing speed.  oneyhen.  you see what i have to live with.  zack, your job is to correctly touch the color the word is spelling in the allotted time.  got it. really.  no. no. no.  did you get all the brains.  yeah. pretty much.  ow.  keep in mind that if you don't respond fast enough, the machine administers a small shock.  okay. wait, what.  cody, you register reply times.  mmmhmm.  this is going to be fun.  so, uh...  okay.   huh.   what do i win. mom and dad's car.  ow. ooh, that hurt.  concentrate. next  hey, that's not fair, i was talking.  yeah, that's usually where your troubles begin.   ow. i felt that one in my toes.  ow. ow.  ow.  get them right and there won't be a problem.   how can i... how can i get them right if they're moving too fast.  oh, very disappointing results...  now.  as long as this makes us... ow. ...even.  let's get one thing straight. we will never be even.    . dy l crabs especially, that little bib you get to wear when you eat them.  he calls it his "crustacean catcher." you two are a barnyard full of crazy.  okay, good luck.  good luck with what.  fine. keep your claws on. i won't tell them.  tell us what.  about the escape.  escape. what escape.  if i told you i wouldn't "not be telling you." hello.  sorry, boys. you're about to be lunch.   we got a runner. we got a runner.  sit.  boo, you, little crabby. boo, you.  help.   salt.  thank you.  more water. read my mind.  napkin.  oh, absolutely.  you guys are all so nice to each other.  why wouldn't we be. that's what i was going to say.  twins should always be nice to each other, don't you agree, ben and sven.  yeah. yeah.  we love being twins. don't you.   well, if by love you mean a dark bottomless pit of constant burning of a thousand white hot suns, then yes.  so, you two don't get along.  sure. we got a long... list of things that we can't stand about each other.  well, you know, how can i get along with someone who's constantly ruining my l or someone who is constantly telling you what's wrong.  well, everything you do is wrong.  oh, like coming here to help you.  oh, please. you only did that because i agreed to give you mom and dad's car if you did.  only because you had no other choice.  zack, cody, you're twins.  why are you hurting each other.  yeah, hurting each other...  hurts each other.  yeah. yeah.  it would be the same as hurting...  all: yourself.  no, no, i don't really agree.  let me demonstrate. see, if i pinch zack...   it doesn't cause me any pain.  and if i, for example, splash this glass of icecold water in cody's face, i don't feel anything. thirsty, dry even.  and if i flip zack out of his chair using the element of surprise...   see. i feel nothing.  i've proved my point.  so, uh, whose grandmother is missing a finger.   these look worse than mom's apricot tuna roll ups.  this is the corsican fruit, the key to all my research.   i guarantee you'll find it's the most delicious fruit you've ever tasted.  more delicious than mango. yes.  more delicious than blueberries. yes.  more delicious than... just eat it.  that is amazing.  yeah, it's like...  it's like it slithered down my throat, and sent my tummy into a yummy frenzy.  it is like, right before it entered my mouth, it swirled around the world's largest lollipop.  it's like my tongue just took a bath in a rainbow.  mine just swam in a peach nectar river.  a peach nectar river. seriously.  oh, like you can take a bath in a rainbow.   cody: mmm, bailey...  please forgive me.  cody wuv bailey.  does bailey wuv cody.  ow. oh, no, my fingers don't bend that way, bailey, stop.   why'd you hit me.  i didn't hit you. i must've just fell.  then why does my arm hurt.  i guess i hit it on the way down.  let's just go to sleep.  you go to sleep. no, you go to sleep.  cody: oh, i really need to call bailey.  i thought she was annoyed with you.  her and i finally had something in common.  well, she was. that's why i decided to give her all that time.  you know, it's scientifically proven, you never confront a woman when she's angry.  or calm, for that matter.  oh, cody...  no cell phones.  it's one of the few rules we have around here.  i really need to call my girlfriend.  it's impossible.   i know, right. no, no, no, it's true.  he has a girlfriend. well, he had a girlfriend.  no, what i meant was that the cell phone's microwave radiation may affect some of our more delicate instruments.  we wouldn't wanna risk a malfunction.   good man.  i hope you both slept well. today, i'm going to be observing while you both perform a series of sports and training exercises...  pass.  actually, he can't pass.  or run, or kick, or hit, or score...  sports and i have a complicated relationship.  walking and you have a complicated relationship.  still, it may provide valuable insights as to how well twins work together as a unit.  well, i guess if it's for science, then okay.  good man.   hey, here's a fun fact.  you can actually hit the ball with these things.  oh, hit it. i couldn't even see the thing.  how come we don't have matching outfits.  you sicken me.   watch it. hey, you watch it.  no.    it's okay. you'll do...  better next time.  yeah. yeah.  the double team. the double team.  they seem weird to you.  i think they're nice.  yeah. yeah.  here goes nothing.  whoa.   ow.   no, i'm climbing back down.  are you serious.  well, actually, i'm a little more introspective.  if they can do it, we can.   girls: don't look down.   man, you're so weak. how do you even button your shirt.  my muscles are cryin it's called sweat.  don't fall, cody. cody, don't fall. cody.  cody:  i'm falling.  i'm falling, i'm falling.   are you feeling something weird.  can't a guy scratch in peace.  no, not that.  i'm feeling whatever you're feeling.  you know how crazy this is.  cody: forget it. i've flossed with thicker strings than this.  zack: what do they have that we don't have.  lack of fear, upper body strength.  wills that are notarized.  trust me, i'm a fivestar athlete.   my leg is falling asleep. oh, no.  my leg is falling asleep, too. push.  i am pushing. you push.  you know i have weak wrists.   bailey: no, no, no. don't take it.  every fallen petal is gonna represent one more phone call you don't get from him.  maybe cody hasn't called because his phone ran out of battery, or he's been abducted by aliens, or a secret society of pilgrims, disguised as aliens so we don't know that they're pilgrims.  and you really think that's possible.  sure. people's phones run out of battery all the no, no, no. see, cody stopped calling me just because i was ignoring him.  well, lots of people ignore me.  just do what i do. ignore them back.  except i'm not sure if they notice because they're ignoring me.  he thinks by not calling me after i didn't answer his calls, that i'll be weakened, call him, he doesn't have to call me again.  but didn't he call you the first time.  only so i could ignore him.  he thinks he's the ultimate strategist.  but like my grammy pickett says, "you can put your boots in the oven, but that don't make 'em biscuits." unless you add flour and eggs.  i mean, sure, they're still chewy, but...  you know what. game on, cody. i'll show him.  what are you going to do.  check this.  not the big "d." oh, yes. oh, it must be done.  i can't watch. tell me when it's over.  cody martin, you are now and forever...   ...deleted.    . can you see me. .  . 'cause i'm right here .  . c y listen. .  . 'cause i've been trying to make you notice .  . what it would mean to me .  . to feel like somebody .  . we've been on our way to nowhere .  . trying so hard to get there .  . and i said oh, we're gonna let it show .  . we're gon just let go of everything .  . holding back our dreams .  . and try to make it come alive .  . come on, let it shine so they can see .  . we were meant to be .  . somebody . . somebody .  . somebody, yeah . . somebody .  . somehow, someday, someway .  . somebody .  . somebody... .  . ooh, ooh, ooh, oh. .   dr. olsen, zack and i have been experiencing some strange phenomenon.  seems almost a little too improbable.  i feel what he feels.  why must you complicate everything.  well, it wouldn't be complicated if you didn't only have one brain cell which is going to die alone.  this is perfect. this is better than perfect.  wait a minute. what's better than perfect.  let's stick with perfect. come with me.  just to be clear, i'm hooked up to this thing again because.  the results should be different this time.  starting.   ow.  what are you complaining about.  i'm the one who got shocked.  i definitely felt pain.  ow. ow.  would you stop that. no, you stop it.  it's the effects of the corsican fruit.  when eaten by twins, it creates a telepathic communication.  that's genius.  yes, it is. and that's only stage one.  zack, cody, are you ready for stage two.  yes, we are.  whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. hold the joy buzzer.  what's stage two.  empathy. creating an emotional connection where stage one created a physical one.  are you prepared.  yes. ow.  that's a no. no. that's a yes. ow.  i heard a no. dr. olsen has vision.   just like you to run off before you finish something.  oh yeah. well, i'm finished being a human lightning rod.  by now, i can recharge my own cell phone.  you know, if you leave, i can't finish my internship.  but you couldn't care less, could you.  wow, cody. actually, i could care less.  and i'm sick of you blaming me for everything that goes wrong in your life.  i only do that because you are to blame.   yeah.  give me one example of how i ruined your life.  two weeks... that doesn't count.  what about when... nope, not that time either.  fine. if you hadn't completely messed up my internship with dr. spaulding, i could be there, as far away from you as possible.  that's not my fault, because if you had just given me the car in the firlace i wouldn't have needed to follow you down to spaulding's to make you change your mind.  a car you're never gonna see now.  oh, ok. cool. cool guy. goodbye, cody.  fine, go.  just one more on the list of things i'll never forgive you for.  you know, out of all the twins i could have gotten stuck with, why did it have to be you.  oh. because you think it's so easy to be the twin of a guy who actually cares why a carrot is more orange than an orange.  yeah. how about this.  don't you do it.  take that digit away from that nasal vestibule.  unsanitary. unsanitary.  you know that sound that you just love so much.  no, don't do it. don't do it, cody.  here it comes.   ooh, cracking.  oh, yeah. how about this, huh.    that's not fair. zack, that's not fair.  i'm wearing briefs.  yeah, well, now they'll have a nice runway for when you take them off.  yeah. you ready for this. you're not even gonna see this coming.     are you leaving.  i wouldn't say leaving. more escaping.  can we go for a walk first.  i can't. i really have to...  after you.  it's hard to be a twin, huh.  no. it's hard to be cody's twin.  being kellie's twin looks like a lot of fun.  kellie and i used to fight.  but through the noble work dr. olsen is doing, we learned how to get along.  besides, once the merge happens, everything will feel right to you.  the merge. i like where this is going.  not with me, silly. with cody.   and i just threw up in my mouth a little bit.  zack, your brother needs you.  cody doesn't need anyone but cody.  you're wrong. you'll see. the merge will fix everything.  cody needs you here. we all need you here.  please, zack.  she's never gonna forgive me.  i'm sorry, cody, but without zack, you're of no use to me.  but, dr. olsen, can you just... no.  fine. i'll do the next stage.  why'd you come back. i thought you said you hated this.  nellie convinced me i should stay.  besides, there's no plane till tomorrow anyway, so...  good choice, zack. kellie.  let's just get this over with. what do i have to do.  the corsican fruit, stage two.  mmm.  mmm.  oh, my god. that's like a lusciousness of lemon and lime.  it's like a symphony of citrus.  it's like a... got it. they're fruity. i know.  you want one.  they're for you. don't.   ...talking to yourself. bad sign.  there's the happy couple. i sent you a fruit cake.  also, there's... hello, bailey.  there you are. i have been looking for you.  mr. moseby, i deleted cody.  i'm sorry to hear about that.  he just got me so mad.  do you think i went too far.  you know, really not for me to say.  look, i found this on the deck. it's addressed to you.  my work is done.   it's from cody. should i open it.  i'm gonna take a leap here.  i think that was his intention.  no. no, you know what.  i'm not gonna give him that satisfaction.  all right. then don't open it.  on the other hand, don't i at least owe him that.  then open it.  well, when he texted me and i didn't reply, he stopped calling.   don't open it.  but on the other hand, he was reaching out to me.  open it.  but what if he...  open it.  open it. for the love of brevity, open it.  i should, right.  okay.  "dear bailey, forgive me for writing this in a note." more like a novel.  "internship," blah, blah, blah.  "spring break," blah, blah, blah.  "scholarship to yale." wait. so...  "so if i want to go to the school of my dreams, "i can't be with the girl of my dreams.  and please recycle this after reading.  "love, cody." oh.  oh, no. what have i done.  it wasn't even that good. i know. right.  hey, guys. guys, i was all wrong.  about that hillbilly hairdo, those hoedown heels, or thinking it's cute to call flossing your teeth, "goin' ropin".  no. i mean, this whole time i've been wrong about cody.  good, good. let it out.  he's selfish, he's a knowitall...  don't you dare criticize the sweetest fellow on earth.  he has the wings of an angel.  london: an angel.  you didn't let me finish.   i know.  he didn't want to spend his spring break with me, but he couldn't if he wanted to get a scholarship to yale.  i know, i know. he was trying to tell you that, but...  i know. he's emotionally stunted. isn't it wonderful.  we have to go to the marine biology reserve and find cody and apologize.  why do i have to apologize. i didn't do anything to him.  wait, which one's cody again. come on.  you feeling anything yet.  not yet.  thanks for coming back.  whatever.  darn right i saved your butt.  i didn't say that.  oh, well, you should have.  no, i didn't say it.  i felt it.  i'm going to think of an emotional memory.  you tell me if you feel what i feel.  come on, you're not still bummed about that stupid little hamster, are you.   that's incredible.  zack, that's exactly what i was...  you set my hamster sigmund freud free.  how did you know that.  i can feel your paralyzing guilt.  well, you're the one who should be guilty, saddling him with a name like sigmund.  i saved him years of hamster high school embarrassment.  i loved sigmund freud.  mommy and i bonded over him.   okay. not only are you gonna break my spirit, but you're gonna mock me as well.  i'm not mocking you.  i'm feeling empathy.   why are you crying harder.  i finally see what it meant to you to get into yale.  it was your life, and i messed it all up.  i'm sorry.  i know you're sorry.  rry, zack. you really are.  i know. oh, no. i know you know.  and i know you know i know.  yeah.  oh. zack.  that's why you wanted the car.  exactly.  cody, you know what you wanna do with your life.  so does bailey.  even london knows exactly who she is.  i'm the only one who doesn't.  i know that somewhere out there i'm great at something. i just need to find it.  and i could find it a lot faster with a cool sports car.  you will find it.  and when you do, i know you'll be great at it.  come on.  come on.  mmm.  mmm.  that feels great.  you're warm, kid.  we should really...  we should do this more often.  olsen: good work getting zack to stay.  thank you, dr. olsen.  nellie, you have been invaluable to this project.  i the merge.  nellie was telling me something about the merge.  although, unfortunately, it wasn't what i hoped it would be.  it's a shame cody has to lose his brain.  he's so talented.  but everyone must sacrifice for the greater good.  except me. my good is greater than the greater good.  it is greater, isn't... yes, come on.  well, that doesn't sound promising.  lose my brain.  but i love my brain. i'm the brainy one, zack.  without my brain i'd just be  the one.  okay, okay, okay. hold on, hold on.  now, while we still have our brains, i suggest that we listen to them telling us to leave.  we can't leave. we can't leave.  if this is what dr. olsen has planned this for us, then what about all the other twins.  we have to save .   i can feel that you're right. man, i hate empathy.  okay, we have to get into his office.  we got to find a way and find out what's going on.  come on, let's go. careful.  okay. go, go. secretly, secretly.  okay.  now...  we can climb that catwalk, shimmy down that pole, go in through the air vent, come out near the lighting system, then we just kick a hole through the ceiling and we drop down right above the instrument panels.  or.  well, sure. if you want to do it the boring way.  this. this.  oh, here we go.  "stage one, the physical connection.  "stage two, the emotional connection.  "stage three.  "the merge." okay.  "during the merge, the twins become one.  "no longer individuals, their identities consolidated "into a single self, able to be controlled." even not knowing what that means, i know it's not good.  it gets worse.  how could it get any worse.  "stage four. hive mind."  yeah, that sounds worse.  "once the merged twins are assembled, "they can be controlled under a single voice." i hear a single voice. it's saying, "run." we've got to free all those other twins.  and most important, we have to avoid eating any more of that fruit.  which you are eating now.  it was here, and i was like, "mmm, that looks good. i'll take one." zack, how could you do that.  it's impulse eating. it's a real problem.  what happens if only one of us eats the fruit.  i don't know. i don't know.  why are you repeating me. why are you repeating me.  i'm repeating you, aren't i. ugh.  that's weird. it's like you say something and then i feel the need to say it.  the next stage. you're becoming me.  i don't want to be you. i want to be me.  i gotta be me.  well, well, well, well, well.  that's a pretty deep well.    trust me, wally. there is a wall there.  dr. spaulding. dr. spaulding.  may i help you.  hi. name is bailey. looking for cody martin.  i haven't seen mr. martin since he and his brother

 we're never going to outrun those more athletic twins.  we don't have to outrun them.  i just have to outrun you.  if i perish from heat exhaustion, bury me in a stone tomb, standing up with a piece of broken gold.  shh, i think i hear something.  tell bailey that i respect her as a woman.  no. okay.  i think we're safe.  both: get zack and cody.  get zack and cody.   climb, climb.  both: get zack and cody.  okay. question.  do you think it's as far down as it looks.  it looks like middleearth.  zack, i want you to know if our bones get crushed like cheap test tubes, which is very likely, i just want you to know that...  yeah. me, too.   okay. on three.  one, two...    i landed on my tummy.  are you okay.  yeah. let's see.  leg. knee. ribs.  not sure what that is. yeah, i'm all right.

evil idiot.  right. i'm an idiot, you're the one that's locked down and wired.  he's got a good point.  cody, why are we strapped down to the mind transference facilitator.  because once i push this button, the electrons in your brains are gonna violently smash together, and merge into one brain.  that sounds like it's really going to hurt.  yes.  where are they. there they are.  let them go. stay back.   careful. nobody move.  cody. bailey.  woody. zack.  london.  woody. uh, son...  woody, what are you... no, no, don't...  dang it.  there's an electrical force field surrounding the perimeter of the platform.  duh.  perfect timing, dr. spaulding.  we meet once again, dr. olsen.  i'm going to disintegrate your individual minds now.  ronald, before you merge them, why don't you show them who you really are.  wow, that is a pretty intense chemical peel.  i had a feeling this guy was twofaced.  meet ronald spaulding, my evil twin brother who disappeared two years ago when the scientific community threw him out.  but i was here the whole time, waiting, developing my brilliant plan.  but if you're also a twin then why would you want all twins to think alike.  so no one would ever have to suffer the pain that i did as a twin.  him, getting all the awards. him, the brilliant one.  him, the award winner.  i feel you, brother.  so you stole my work to use for your own evil.  i did. but how.  it was easy. first, i posed as a janitor where i methodically stole your data.  i designed this entire facility myself.  it's completely state of the art and wicked cool.  well, that looks promising.  when i read cody's paper on twins, i thought he and his brother would be a great asset.  so i went to the boat and i spied on them.  i am so excited. i've been planning our trip for a month.  whoa, whoa. hey.  cody: that's what was in the letter.  zack: why did you drop it, then.  hey. hey, hey.  i knew if i could lure them here, i could use them in my research.  then all of my years of pain would finally have a purpose.  i could create a controlled, peaceful society.  through violen.  well, no plan is perfect.  can i just say something.  someone had a big bowl of grumpy this morning.   )
