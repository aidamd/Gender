 ch.  but you guys go ahead.  i got to hit the library anyway.  i'm representing the eighth grade in a big competition.  so you two go get your exercise.  i'll be flexing the old coconut.  oh, what a beautiful baby.  who's the mommy.  both: we are.  it's a doll.  we're practicing what it's like to be parents for health class.  i know all about being a parent.  i remember when dudley took his first steps.  dudley's your pet chicken.  and i remember his first words, too.  bawkbawkbawk, bawk. bawk. bawk.  bawk.  what a smart chicken.  i know. isn't he.  time to go shopping for london, jr.  we are not calling it london, jr.  why not.  uh, because he's a boy.  how do you know.  uh, because i've been the one changing his diapers.  don't you think we should be dividing up the responsibilities.  you take care of him and i buy him stuff.  yay, london, jr.   that's not his name.   now look what you did.  me.  ladies, why do you have a crying baby in my lobby.  it's not a baby. it's our homework assignment.  is there any way you can get your homework assignment to shut up.  we're trying.  she's crying because maddie woke him up by yelling.  or maybe he's crying because you refuse to feed, change, or touch him.  hello. manicure.  just give me that.  how do you turn the thing off.  oh.   he's not a real baby.  trust me. i love children.  let me hold your baby.  hey, cody, wanna go see a movie.  killer koala opened downtown.  i don't know.  i really got to work on my speech.  it's very important.  first prize is a golden tongue.  come on.  we're talking about cute, furry, woodland creatures wreaking havoc on an unsuspecting public.  well, i guess a break won't hurt.  i'll go grab my turtleneck so i can hide my eyes during the scary parts.   come in.  oh, hey, theo, what's up.  wanna go.  2 tickets, huh.  well, cody and i were going to seekiller koala.  saw it. he was framed by the platypus.  these are floor seats.  are you kidding.  close enough for them to sweat on us.  and if we're lucky, bleed.  ok, i'm in.  hey, zack, i brought my sweater with the big pockets so we can bring our own popcorn and save money, too.  oh, hi, theo.  yeah, about that. change of plans.  theo's got tickets to the celtics game.  oh, cool. i'll go grab my "defense" sign.  it's a capital "d" and then a picket fence.  i only have 2 tickets.  but you would've been my third choice.  but you have to do your speech thing, so it's cool, right.  uh, yeah. i guess so.  come on, zack. we don't wanna miss shootaround.  i got to tell my mom.  want my dfence sign.  i've already got my "i'm a dork" tshirt in the car.  so, fellow americans, look in the mirror and ask yourself, " like it.  hmm.  guess not.  i'm sorry, cody. it's just that i'm exhausted.  i was up all night taking care of the baby.  what baby. i didn't even know you got married.  please, cody, i'm only 16, and i've never even kissed a boy.  oh, please. save it for the nuns.  i'm talking about the baby simulator london and i have to take care of for health class.  thank goodness she's finally helping out.  maddie, i bought london, jr.  the most adorable cashmere sweater.  it's what all the bestdressed baby simulators are wearing.  i know it's a little big, but i figure he'll grow into it.  ok. 2 things.  1he's a doll.  he's not growing into anything.  2where is he.  calm down. he's fine. he's with the nanny.  nanny. you left our baby with a nanny.  i had 22 nannies, and i turned out just fine.  london, you're missing the whole point of the aignment.  we're supposed to be taking care of the baby ourselves to learn responsibility.  but i am being responsible.  i installed a nanny cam on the stroller.  don't you want your baba.  look. nanny esteban likes it.   esteban is our nanny.  the man's best friend is poultry.  hey, guys, we're here for our playdate.  london, i named my son after you.  for the last time, his name is lebron.  and guess what. you're the godmother.  oh.  she can't even mother her own child.  she handed him off to a nanny.  ooh, is she good. can i have her number.  this is ridiculous.  we are supposed to be the ones taking care of him.  but i am taking care of him.  i didn't see you starting a trust fund.  esteban, please bring over that suitcase.  but i'm with child.  get over here with that suitcase if you wanna be with paycheck.  oh, right away, mr. moseby.  no. no.  are you ok.  thanks. i'm fine.  not you. the hair to the tipton fortune.  " and he's fine, no thanks to you.  so you still think a nanny's a good idea.  esteban, you're fired.  as the nanny or as the bellboy.  as the nanny.  but the day is young.  i've had it with you.  you have the parenting skills of a toaster.  tonight i am going to stay with you and make sure you start pulling your weight in this relationship and take care of our baby.  i'm not gonna let your bad parenting cost me a grade.  ok, but after we get our "a" on this assignment, i want a divorce.  fine.  fine.  so how was the game.  ah, nothing special.  'cause i listened to it on the radio, and the celtics won on a 65foot shot in double overtime.  hohum.  so how is the speech thing coming.  you'll hear monday night.  ooh, is it this monday.  it always has been.  it's been up on the fridge for 3 weeks.  well, this monday theo's got tickets to the black eyed peas concert.  he and the peas go way back.  he knew them when they were the pods.  but i'll bring you back a fergie bobblehead.  don't bother.  have fun with your new best friend.  aw, come on, buddy, don't be like that.  cody, bone finger.  ow.  how about going out for dinner.  how about helping with math, first.  how about calling for takeout.  how about calling sylvan.  if schoolwork isstressful, call sylvan.  ..  and build the skillsfor success. guaranteed.  to learn how sylvan can help, .. now, for a free dvd/information kit.  must be 18 orolder to call.  ok, the bottle and the milk are heated up.  now can i feed him.  no. first you have to test it on skin.  oh.  is it ok.  it's fine.  just feed him.  sister dominick had to pair me with you.  darn nun.  there. i said it.  i cursed a nun, and i don't care. darn nun.   why is he crying now.  well, he probably has gas.  babies need to be burped to get the air out.  you have to lightly tap him on his back.  oh.   hey, he stopped crying.  i did it. yay, me.  remind me not to ask you to change his diaper.  hey, cody, how's the speech coming.  great. thanks.  i've got 3 metaphors, 2 analogies, and a simile.  i'm a sucker for a good simile.  i'm glad someone will be there because zack's too busy.  what do you mean.  he only has time for theo now.  ever since he started hanging out with that guy, he's become completely different.  honey, i think you're exaggerating a little bit.  hey, mom, have you seen my gold watch with the diamond accents.  we need to talk.  you bet we do.  cody, go to your room. work on your speech.  fine.  but the muse is gone.  you're not coming to cody's speech.  theo and i are going to see a concert tonight.  but he's been to all the special events in your life.  he sits there and watches all your basketball games, all your baseball gameshe's on the team.  yeah, but he never plays.  and he gave you a standing ovation when you won the award for most improved in remedial math.  it's just one speech, mom.  i told him i'd bring him back a bobblehead.  he can't be bought with a bobblehead.  now, material things will not solve all your problems.  works for theo.  i had a boyfriend once.  oh, no. here it comes.  he used to shower me with stuffrings, bracelets, necklaces, clothes, shoesand there was this one pair of earringsmomsorry.  one day i realized i really didn't like him.  what i really liked were the things he gave me.  so you broke up with him.  no. he dumped me.  but that's not the point.  the point is, your friendship shouldn't be for sale.  so are you saying you're going to make me miss the concert and go to cody's speech.  but while you're disappointing your brother, i want you to think about whether or not theo is a real friend.  so i can go to the concert.  if you think that's the right thing to do.  so i can go to the concert.  if you really want to.  so i can go to the concert.  if you can live with yourself.  i can. ok.  i'm going. then go.  all right.  .. while you're going, you think about you're disappointing your broi have got to get better at this guilt thing.    maddie, baby.  london, your turn.  i'll give you a hundred bucks.  i am so tired, no amount of money could get me up.  a thousand.  rise and shine.   oh, oh, oh, oh.  here. now, pay up.  it's ok, london, jr.  don't cry.  i don't think asking him is going to help.  he's been crying for 2 days straight.  here.  get the pacifier.    now what are we gonna do.  i don't know. do you have any suggestions.  i mean besides the swiss boarding school.   ladies, i am getting all sorts of complaints.  we don't know what to do.  he won't stop crying.  fine. then i'll tear out its batteries.  don't you touch our baby.  he's a doll.  you bet he is, and you're not touching a hair on his wittle head.  it's not the hair on his wittle head.  it's just making it worse.  just give him to me.  give him to me. he wants his mommy.  i'm his mommy, too.  i buy nicer things. he likes me more.  i actually take care of him.  you're hurting him. you're hurting him.  just let go.   i miss that little baby. he was so cute.  although the crying gave me a headache.  goodbye, my little london.  for the last time, his name is lebron.  what did you do, play hockey with this baby.  no. he fell out of a window.  we kind of got in a little argument over our parenting styles.  i guess we got so caught up arguing that we forgot about the baby.  we were both probably a little irritable 'cause we hadn't slept for 2 days.  and the baby didn't stop crying the whole time.  until he hit the ground.  the truth is, we just couldn't handle it.  we're not ready to be parents.  so just go ahead and fail us.  fail you.  you completely understood the purpose of this assignment.  aplus.  london: darn nun.  there. i said it.  i cursed a nun, and i don't care.  darn nun. darn nun. darn nun.  kids.  they say the darndest things.  there you are. what took you so long.  what took me so long is that you called me and asked me to pick up all this stuff on my way here.  i had to go to 3 stores just to find your cat's favoritecaviar and bits.  the new formula.  new formula.  never mind. we're late for the concert.  let's get going.  you know, the peas don't go on until 9:00.  so i was thinking on the way there, maybe could we stop by my school and hear cody's speech.  then we could go to the park and watch grass die.  look, i know it's not exciting, but he is my brother, and it means a lot to him.  you're hanging out with me now.  here. put this under your shirt.  i wanna tape the concert.  isn't that illegal.  that's why it's underyourshirt.  you know, i'm not sure i wanna go anywhere with you.  why don't you go hang out with your lame brother.  my brother may be lame and a geek and a weenie and he flosses between every bite andwhat are we talking about again.  oh, yeah.  theo, you can't insult my brother and you can't buy my friendship.  what are you saying.  i'm saying we're through.  excuse me.  i only give jam force maxes to my friends.  take 'em.  and the sweat suit.  ok, fine.  and the pants.  ahem.  i believe the bling bling is mine mine.  at least now i can leave with my dignity.  i'm nervous, mom.  what if i get in front of the audience and freeze up.  well, there's an old trick that always worked for me.  just picture the audience in their underwear.  hey, it works.  honey, where are the rest of your clothes.  i gave them backto theo.  the price was too high.  so you're comingto my speech.  absolutely.  so my guilt thing worked.  yes, mom.  i've learned2 things today is that 1you can't buy friendship, and 2city bus
