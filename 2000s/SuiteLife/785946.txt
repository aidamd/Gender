says you.  this stinks.  i'm offering good ideas, but zach's promising ice cream, super models, and skate parks.  i don't even want to vote for me anymore.  you can't give up.  i am sick of london buying everything she wants.  we're going to show her that our precious democratic process is not for sale.  how.  we're going to steal it.  with dirty tricks.  but doesn't that go against everything you believe in.  yes.  but in this case, the end justifies the means.  just promise me no one will get hurt.  i cat make that promise.  oddly, i'm ok with that.  vote for zack, get a free tipton pen.
