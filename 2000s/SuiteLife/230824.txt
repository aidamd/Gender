 now one of the best ways to get over someone who hurt you is to cut their face out of all your photos.  oh, w.  what did you do with all of them.  they make great kitty litter.  okay, now did you bring pictures of you and hewhoshallnotbenamed.  voldemort.  she means cody.  and yes, i brought all of our scrapbooks.  then let's start cutting.  moseby never lets me use biggirl scissors.  oh, right right right.  this is crazy.  you can only leave this island once a week.  by land.  i do have a dinghy.   but my dinghy has a leak.   what's he laughing about.  it's true.  i have a leaky dinghy.  woody, what do you think a dinghy is.  a small rowboat.  why.  okay, i'm not staying on an island for one week with no girls.  then swim, because i came here for some peace and quiet, and you two clowns oh, is that the dinner bell.  hope we're having sloppy joes.  i love me some sloppy joes.  no.  not sloppy joes.  ..  ooh, a straw, a straw.  milk shakes.  oh, a key.  key lime pie.  i love key lime pie.  rub eyedryrubbed cajunstyle rib eye.  yes. steak.  a good steak.  you idiots.  i'm trying to tell you we're supposed to be silent.  strawit is milk shakes.  oh, man.  my butt.  talk about cruel and unusual punishment.  and for an hour.  i thought it would never end.  i know.  how dare they make us sit in those uncomfortable chairs and think about what we'd done.  i don't get it.  how's ice cream supposed to make you feel better.  it just does, okay.  yeah yeah, a huge one.  and i'm totally miserable.  he's totally miserable.  he should be.  i am the best thing that's ever happened to you.  what.  don't deny it, cody.  she thinks i'm cody.  i do such a better cody.  give it to me.  hello, bailey.  it's cody.  hi, woody.  hi.  bailey, it's zack.  look, we need your help.  moseby that we're stranded on this isl hello.  i think he hung up.  oh, my exes do that to me too and change their numbers and their names and sometimes their faces.  all right, that's it.  i'm leaving.  this is pathetic.  what.  you can't leave.  we're gonna put pretty dresses on.  really.   on cats.  oh, just get your stupid paw through the sleeve.  that's the tail hole.  whatever.  stupid overdressed kitty.   what did you call me.   whiskers loves to cuddle.  you know, for the first time i am starting to feel better.  get off me now.   you were silent for an entire hour.  i bet it gave you a chance to discover something about yourselves.  yeah, i discovered that i have to get off the dude island.  how.  the only way ishow do you normally get off the island, brother theodore.  i told you, i have a little dinghy.  what.  don't mind him he is a little dingy.  what's in store for us next, brother.  oh, let me see.  oh, here you are.  you're on the kiln list.  the kill list.  please, i'm not ready to die.  i promise i won't laugh at your dinghy again.  the kiln list, not the kill list.  though you're about to get on that one too.  it means we have to make pottery.  but i don't have to go.  make pottery, not potty.  you guys get what, like every other word.  guys what every word.  is it just me or is he really hard to understand.   i would be duly honored if you two would join me in a glass of sweet tea.  oh, well, i do declare, nothing would make me happier, sugar.  where are those scissors.  i'd li so, aunt kitty cat, shall we sashay up to the sky deck.  what.  we're going out in public with these things.  please, miss london, speak only through your cat.  fine.  i just want to say one thingyou two are a couple of nut jobs.  london, i know it's silly, but this is helping me forget about cody.  oh, that's it.  this has got to stop.  look, bailey, i know you loved cody, but you don't need a boyfriend to be happy.  you're young.  you're smart.  you're pretty.  you're not some 50something cat lady who's been dumped time and time and time again and is one icecream scoop away from a heart attack.  london, you called me pretty and didn't add "annoying" after it.  do you really think all those things about me.  of course i do.  why do you think we're friends.  london, thank you.  boyfriends come and go, but girlfriends are always there for you.  right, now let's do something that will really cheer you upmanipedis on me.  it'll be so fun.  oh, thanks for offering to pay 'causeoh.  hmm.  humans always leave.  good thing cats can't use doorknobs.  what are you making, woody.  a clay canoe.  i'm getting out of here.  will you two just forget about leaving and enjoy the serenity that comes from being in touch with the earth.  i'm making a bua korean percussion instrument used in confucian ritual music.  i'm making a clay hottie.  at least she will be once i get her in the kiln.  some of us are trying to forget women.  clayrissa.  my bu.  what did you do to my bu.  now it's just goo.  oh, boohoo for you.  here, start over.  guys guys guys.  oh, it's on like pingpong.  what is going on in here.  that's it.  you three are in big sucker.  oops.  that's it.  i don't care if i have to sit in the chair of extreme discomfort for a week.  i have something to say.  cody, look.  i know you're in pain over your breakup with bailey.  who wouldn't be.  seriously, this girl is smokin'.  eh.  the point is running away from your troubles is not the answer.  you've got your whole life to live.  there's a big world out there filled with awesome experiences, but you can't have any of them if you're just stuck here on this island with a bunch of weird bald dudes.  he ain't wrong.  zack, i appreciate that, but my brothersthese aren't your brothers.  i'm your brother.  and i care about you.  i'm not leaving this island without you.  thanks, zack.  real brothers are so much better than these losers.  you know, at first i thought you just showed up because you needed me to do your homework.  dude, that hurts.  well, i guess i'm going home with you guys.  oh, please take me with you.  i'm tired of going potty in a ditch.  i'll go get my good sandals.  out of my way.  good thing i used a bald cap and didn't actually shave my head.  dang it.  "eventually " aw, man.  i have to go back to the optometrist.  i'm reading this "mosquito man" comic, but it's all blurry.  you should try wearing the 3d glasses.  ah.   mosquitoes.  they're all over me.   oh.   come in.  cody.  bailey.  woody.  sorry, i just wanted to play.  now that we're broken up, i'm returning your stuff.  oh, really.  yeah, i mean, i thought you might need your graphing calculator, your scientific calculator, ..  wow, you need a calculator to figure out how many calculators you have.  well, i have one.  it's just not the kind of thing you lend out.  while you're here, i do have some of your things.  you had my washboard hero.  i was practicing to impress you, but i guess i don't have to anymore.  i certainly won't miss trying to blow "tiny dancer" on the jug.  well, i certainly won't miss having to rub hand sanitizer on my face before you'll kiss me.  you know how many germs there are on the human cheek.  no one does except you and it's weird.  ..  that is why i do not have a girlfriend.  yeah, that's why.  . oh ay oh, oh ay oh .  . come along with me .  . and let's head out to see .  . what this world has .  . for you and for me now .  . whichever way the wind blows .  .. .  .  . oh ay oh .  . this boat's rocking .  . oh ay oh .  . ain't no stopping us now .  . 'cause we're living the suite life .  . oh ay oh .  . this boat's rocking .  . oh ay oh .  . rocking the whole world round .  . and we're living the suite life now .  . hey ho, oh ay oh .  .   yay.  i got an "a" on my money tree.  but there's no money on it.  there was when i handed it in.  look, cody, we got an on our science project.  you're welcome.  where do you think you're going with buck.  back to my cabin.  um, i don't think so.  he's coming home with me.  uh, not so fast.  he's more my rat than yours.  no, he's not.  i'm the one who cared enough to name him.  cared.  you just used the term for a male ratbuck.  i did not.  buck was named after how my teeth looked when i was 10.  now let go.  no, you let go.  no, give him back.  what right do you have to take buck from me.  what's going on.  he's my child.  i just got a call about a disturbance.  thanks for coming so quickly.  what are you two fighting about.  we're arguing over who should get to keep our lab rat buck.  hey there, little fella.  .. come here.   look, he likes me.  he's giving me little kisses.  he's just licking barbecue sauce off your tie.  now can i please have him back.  no, don't give him to cody.  give him to me.  no, me.  i'm clearlyyou two need to cool the heck down now.  i'm gonna need some backup in the science lab.  you don't even have a radio.  you're just talking to your shoulder.  that's it.  against the wall, mister.  whoa.  easy, big guy.  you're right.  sorry.  when bad stuff goes down, my 30 minutes of cruise ship securityguard training kicks in.  wasn't that, like, an online course.  yeah.  i had to come up with a user name and a password.  that was intense.  since you guys can't decide who should get the rat, maybe you should have a responsible, impartial third party decide.  good idea, woody.  i'd be happy to do it.  nowell, i guess that would be okay.  obviously you're gonna pick me.  ha, no.  he's going to pick me.  i'm not picking anybody until i do a thorough evaluation and background check on the both of you.  in the meantime, i'll take care of this cute little guy.   aw, look at his little whiskers.  hi hi. ow.  that little booger bit me.  well, that's what you get for always taking his food.  i can't help it.  these food pellets are delicious.  mm mm.  uh, woody, those aren't food pellets.   zack: you know, sloane, these strawberries are almost as sweet as you.  does this rat bite look infected.  not now, woody.  now where were we.  i got a tetanus shot and antibiotics on it.  but when you lift up the scab, it's all milky in there.  look.  ew.  it even smells disgusting.  oh, no no no.  that's actually just my socks.  bye.  thanks a lot, woody.  well, i'm sorry, but this rat bite is really freaking me out.  why don't you go bother cody.  no way.  he might have that evil lab rat with him.  lab rat, huh.  now let me get this straight.  you were bitten by a rat that had been subjected to scientific experimentation.  yeah. so.  so. you read comic books.  you're probably beginning to mutate as we speak.  mutate.  uhhuh.  oh, you're even beginning to grow rat whiskers.  i am.  ah, and your eyes are turning pink.  yep, you're transforming into a rat.  yyou're right.  i feel this sudden urge to scurry.  zack, you've gotta help me.  okay okay.  now if i were you, i'd scurry immediately into hiding.  if the government figures out you're a mutant, they'll lock you up and experiment on you.  remember what they did to poor poor mosquito man.  theythey cut him open and tried to remove his proboscis to turn him into a giant bloodsucking superweapon.  dude, stuff like that happens.  ahh.  whew.  all right, bailey, i'm here to observe how you interact with buck.  i have everything i need to take notes: notepad, pen, and mr. gingerbread.  you really need that.  you're right, i can just remember everything.  now you and the rat just go about your normal business.  okay well, as you can see, kirby, this is a loving, nurturing environment for buck.   a rat, a rat, a rat.  kill it, kill it, kill it.  london, it's just my pet rat buck.  ugh, you know, it's bad enough i have to live with you.  now i have to live with another hairylegged, bucktoothed creature.  she's just jealous because you can find your way out of a maze and she can't.  now cody the control freak would keep poor bucky locked up all day, where i would allow him to roam freely around the cabin.  cody: that is the worst idea i've ever heard.  yeah, i agree with the dork.  that is disgusting.  cody, this is my evaluation with buck.  you're not supposed to be here.  cody:uh, correction.  i'm not supposed to be in the room, which i'm not.  i'm in the hallway.  you're gonna be in the hospital if you don't get out of here.  please stop.  i don't like conflict.  you're a security guard.  you think i wanted this gig.  if i could fit in a tollbooth, i'd have my dream job.   oops.  i crushed him.  .  oh, that's it.  i'm breaking down this door.  daddy's coming, bucky.  where's buck and how bad is he crushed.  right here, and not at all.  then who was crushed.  mr. gingerbread.  cody: now, kirby, you're about to see why my cabin would make a far safer and happier home for buck.  compelling argument.  give the rat to cody.  what are you even doing here, london.  trying to make sure that filthy rat doesn't move into my cabin.  rats are not filthy.  that's a vicious stereotype spread by cats and pied pipers.  now research has shown that daily mental stimulation helps keep rats healthy and happy.  .. time for math. )
