charge of.  blowing up the balloons.   great juice, cody.  a lot of people don't like guava.  it's very high in fiber and vitaminc, you know.  yes, i do know.  i wrote a paper on it.  you know what i

the cash, hold the lips.  man, that's tasty stuff.  what a sugar rush. whoohoo.  yeah.  ooh. yeah.  all: . go, barbara, go barbara .  . go, barbara, go barbara .  zack, this is great.  the salty snacks are making the kids drink more, and the sugary drinks are fueling their energy.  it goes against everything i believe in, and i couldn't be happier.  .  correction. now i couldn't be happier.  well, me and my friends agree.   shh. shh.  you'll wake the boys.  but it's almost noon.  i wanted them to sleep.  they were working late last night, my little club owners.  i understand why you don't want to wake them.  perhaps you can pay these bills.  boys, get your sleeping butts out here.  you do realize that i can't be held liable for these bills in any court of law, right.  plus you were dopey enough to give them the gig.  ok.  boys, how do you plan to pay for these bills.  well, i was thinking cash.  and i was thinking ok.  you sleep with a huge wad of cash in your pajamas.  like a baby.  well done, boys.  in fact, how would you like to take over the lounge on tuesday nights.  i sing in the lounge on tuesday nights.  yes, yes.  of course you do. it's wonderwonderwonderful.  we'll talk.  you will not. i have a contract.  so for next week, let's do a theme night.  oh. you mean like traffic safety night.  i'll go iron my orange vest.  no. i mean a theme that doesn't stink.  start taking notes.  we'll do a sixties nightlava lamps, psychedelic posters, live music, and gogo girls.  ki ..  what are you, a seal.  maybe we should take our profits and not push our luck.  cody, why are you questioning me.  who turned our club into a success.  you.  and who was right about spending money to make money.  you.  and when we were 5, who convinced you that if you ate your toenails a foot would grow in your stomach.  you. mmhmm.  and yet you still doubt me.  look, man.  i'm king midas.  everything i touch turns to gold.  you've really got to work on that low selfesteem thing.  cody, if you think small, you're always going to be small.  you got to think big.  i'm going to turn club twin into the biggest thing boston has ever seen because i am the man.  what does that make me.  you. you're the brother of the man.  now, give the man back his money.  maddie: london, that perfume you gave me is amazing.  everywhere i went, boys couldn't stay away, and i gave some to grandma.  turns out, grandpa can walk faster than we thought.  i told you it was great.  the smell of london is the smell of love.  you know, i do have some other simply london cosmetics.  are you interested.  gee. i don't want to impose.  what you got.  well, shampoo, body powder, body wash, body lotion, hand cream, face cream, foot cream, ear cream. ear cream.  you want chapped ears.  no.  i'll take it all.   how tart is your ginger ale.  pretty darn tart.  my doctor says i'm tart intolerant.  why am i not surprised.  then maybe i should go with grape.  ok. then grape it is. ha ha.  but i'm wearing a white shirt.  oh, please.  there's thirsty people back here.  boy, for a hippie, you're not very mellow.  give me that.  i'm watching you.  ..  groovy. expensive.  well, whatever bread it's costing us we'll make back triple.  don't bring me down, bro.  you're turning my mood ring blue.  ooh. light my fire, zack.  you're speaking in sixties vernacular.  right on.   club twin, inc. president zack speaking.  no. no, no, no.  when i do hawaiian night, i want real palm trees, real coconuts, and a real pork volcano that shoots out barbeque sauce.  then make one.  wait. next week is hawaiian night.  and then the week after that is a night in paris.  can we hold off on next week until we get through this week.  your gogo dancers haven't even shown up yet.  don't worry. these babes are gonna be hot.  wow. far out, man.  those babes wouldn't be hot even if they were on fire.  wow. this place is out of sight.  yeah. now i can see. it's very nice.  woman: hey, boys. we're the caged women.  arr. arr.  yeah. well, who let you out.  no, no, no. we're the dancers.  yeah, the gogo dancers.  oh, ya.  no offense, lady, but it looks like your gogo wentwent.  mm. i love these cages.  if it really doesn't matter, i'd like to dance in the cage nearest to the bathroom in case i really have to gogo.  zack, you told me you booked two dancers who looked like they were from the sixties, not two dancers in their 60s.  well, they looked great in the pictures.  you didn't notice the brontosaurus in the background.  well, i was a little busy planning future theme nights.  oh, that's great since you did such a good job booking tonight's dancers.  wow. nice pattern on your stockings.  i'm not wearing stockings.  so where's this hot band.    oh, don't be the young rebels.  don't be the young rebels.  don't be the young rebels.  we're the young rebels.  whoohoo. rebels.  hey. look at this, paul.  they dug up the caged women.  did doreen get a hip replacement.  looking good, doreen.  let's hit the stage. come on, guys.  bob said i can't have any more soda.  well, you did go a little overboard last week.  i take ap math, ap geography, ap science.  i even take ap lunch.  not to mention cello, piano, and my bat mitzvah lessons.  so if once a week i want to cut loose with a little soda, just give it to me without all the mishegas.  ok. um, bob, one root beer, hold the mishegas.  man: here's our big hit from 1968, and i'm sure you'll all remember it.  i hope i remember it.  . give me, give me, give me right now .  . love lightning .  . i've got to have your love and how .  . love lightning .  . love is like a lightning bolt .  . love lightning .  . it gets me like a.   . love lightning .  hey, hey, hey. wait, guys.  stay for the finale.  they smash their instruments.  it's so cool.   rock and roll. oh, oh, oh.    we tried this 40 years ago, and it didn't work then.  agnes: zack, your club is smoking.  thank you. you see.  my club is smoking.  no, no. i mean, your club is really smoking.  ohh.  whoa. this like chicago in '68.  the man is hosing us down.  and a really small man, too.  nice job, midas.  everything you touched turned to old.  i want you to know, people are gonna tell you that you really messed up, that tonight was a disaster and you made fools of yourselves.  i just wanted to say i'm one of those people.  cody: well, after paying for the band, the dancers, advertising, and barbara's sugar intervention, we're left with $400.  well, hey. that's not bad.  that should cover about half the damages.  the rest you can work off scrubbing pots and pans for minimum wage.  peace.  well, hey. we got summer jobs.  ..  all right. say it.  say what.  say that i was too busy being a big shot to listen to anyone else.  go ahead. tell me off.  zack, i have to admit running a hot nightclub was a great experience.  thanks.  you know, i don't think you're really grasping the whole tell me off concept.  we had some ups and downs, but it was a great ride, like a roller coaster, just without the nausea.  although i did feel a little queasy watching doreen dance.  ehh. ehh.  so. you don't blame me.  oh, i blame you, but i admire your chutzpa.  barbara taught me that word.  so you don't think i'm a total loser.  total. no.  in fact, one day, i think you'll hit a winner and stay with it all the way to the top.  you know, i'm glad that you mentioned that because i heard about this great new franchise, right, and i was thinking that we might dip into our savings.  you don't have any savings.  well, i was thinking that we might dip into your savings.  you are not touching piggy.  it's a can'tmiss opportunity.  all right. what is it.  glowinthedark pizza.  what makes it glow.  don't ask.  maddie, maddie.  maddie.  where are you.  i have more simply london cosmetics products for you.  and what makes you think i want to use them.  did my products do that to you.  no, no. i decided to go to clown college.  well, then you look perfect.  of course your products did this.  oh, my.  oh. what's that smell.  d most people are guessing dead ferret.  apparently, your perfume changes the longer you wear it.  that's not good.  you think.  did you test the stuff.  yes. on you.  i should takepicture of this for the boysin daddy's lab.  they'll probablywant to know about it.  no, no. please don't.  ow. i can't see.  you're
