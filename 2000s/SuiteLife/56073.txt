from her date last night.  i don't even know if she's coming to the wedding.  okay, dude, we've gotta talk, ..   ..to chicken.  look, you know my feelings about marriage.  that it is the death of all joy.  tly.  but you know you love francesca and if you want to have a life with her, you're gonna have to stop worrying about your mommy.  but my mother means everythinglook, i'm gonna tell you something that i've never told anyone.  when our mom came on the boat to say goodbye, there was a part of me that said, " oh, i can imagine.  this is a great adventure.  but there was also a part of
