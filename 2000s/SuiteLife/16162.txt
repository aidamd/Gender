 .  . this boat's rockin' .  .  . rockin' the whole world round .  . and we're living the suite life now .  . hey, ho. ohayoh.  .    rise and shine.  shine and rise.  the cows need milking, so open your eyes.  it's 6:00 a.m.  look, why do you always have to get up so early.  the early bird catches the worm.  is that what you farm folk eat for breakfast.  it's an expression.  ..  " i don't get it.  when i asked you to go to sleep last night, you stayed on the phone chitchatting till all hours.  it was 7:30.  even the old people were still awake playing bingo.  that's because they did well in school " there's only one solution to this problem: tonight you go sleep in that big white hammock outside.  that's a lifeboat.  i know.  and take your chirpy chicken with ya.  hey, olivia.  want some watermelon.  i'd love some, but my daddy says i'm not supposed to talk to you.  you don't have to talk.  just sit, eat and spit seeds into this towel.  wow, the towel boy must hate you.  yes.  mm. this is so sweet.  well, if you like things that are sweet, how about a date with me.  i'd love to, but unfortunately i can only go out with boys my father approves of.  so i guess you haven't datedever. never.  never dated.  he wouldn't even let me have an imaginary boyfriend.  really.  yeah.  but i had one anyway.  his name was chad.  go away, chad.  well, i know of a way to have a real boyfriend that your father will approve of.  you're going to become a boring stickinthemud.  no, not when ..  cody.  but i don't want to date cody.  oh, no one does.  just trust me.  i hate zack.  i hate zack.  hi, zack.  hey, buddy.  look, i really like olivia so i need you to pretend to date her.  see, my father won't let me date zack because he thinks he'sa worthless goodfornothing loser.  your father's an excellent judge of character.  but my father likes you.  he does.  oh, joy.  so all you need to do is pick up olivia and then hand her over to me.  at the end of the date, you take her home.  why in the world would i do that.  more face time with mr. harvard.  ah. good point.  i'll do it.  but how will i explain it to bailey.  who's bailey.  my brother's secret love.  he

even figure out how to work velcro shoes.  do you know what her father's going to say when he sees her.   what did you do to my little girl.  what's going on.  uh, well, i, uhi'll tell you what's going on, daddy.  i'm not dating the brainy nerd.  that would be me.  what.  i'm dating his brother.  the hot bad boy.  ha.  guilty as charged.  olivia, you disobeyed me.  why.  because i felt like it.  daddy, please stop telling me what to do and who to date.  and another thing, i don't want to go to harvard.  i want to be a sponge diver because i love water.   you're never going to date my daughter again.  and you.  you can forget about getting into harvard.  when i'm done with you, you'll be lucky to get into clown college.   i don't like clown college.  whoa whoa whoa.  wait a minute.  don't blame him, he was just helping me out.  all the more reason.  hey, listen, buddy.  you'll never get a better candidate for harvard.  0 gradepoint average.  he's brilliant.  he's written a novel, three cook books, an opera, all of my papers and he even got a patent on a mechanical spice rack.  and if harvard is too stupid to recognize those qualities, then it's your loss.   come on, buddy.  there are plenty of other colleges like the one that sounds like the big fish.  you mean yale.  yeah, yale.  he's going to yale.  uck.  the dormsarenicer.  andtheyhave an atomic particle accelerator.   well, harvard had one of those.  but it broke.  yeah, that's because no one there knows how to factor negative isotomic transition.  mmm.  do you know how to do that.  yeah.  but i'm going to yale.  and i'm going to be a fountain.  throw pennies at me.  oh, dude, you got change for a dollar.  so you raise.  well, i fold.  hey, cody.  hi, bailey.  hey, you know how we were talking about the waterslide on the fiesta deck.  yeah.  and that i would feel safer if i went down the slide in somebody's arms.  yeah. yeah.  i tried it with frank.  and you were right.  it's fabulous.  you should try it with your girlfriend.  i hate frank.  hey. how was school.  max, why are you carrying alex's backpack like that.  she told me my backpack was bending my spine, so she gave me hers to even it out.  let's check.  there. all straight. you're welcome.  alex, your brother is not your pack mule.  yeah. i'm not your pack mule.  i'm sorry, maxey.  could you take this upstairs for me. sure.  ok.  best day in school ever.  they found the guy that was putting peanut butter in your locker.  no. but this made me forget about that.  so i'm in biology, right, when mr. medina has us pick lab partners.  and like always, my partner ends up being the frog i'm dissecting.  ugh. i have the opposite problem.  everybody wants me to be their lab partner.  you don't take biology.  that's what i keep telling those guys.  anyway, in walks this brandnew girl, and she is the hottest thing i've ever seen in my life.  eva longoria goes to your school.  eva longoria.   kids love eva longoria.  it'sit's, ah. continue, son.  medina assigns the beautiful miranda hampson to be my lab partner.  isn't she that new goth girl in the 11th grade.  she's not goth.  she just likes wearing black and dark makeup and listens to bands that are kind of scary.  oh, so not goth but goth.  i'm in the tenth grade. she's an older woman.  thata boy. like your mother.  the hot part.  hold on, now. the story gets even better.  so me and my miranthat's my cute nickname yeah, miranaccidentally reach for the scalpel at the same time, and our hands touched, and she didn't pull away for 3 seconds. ho.  ho.
