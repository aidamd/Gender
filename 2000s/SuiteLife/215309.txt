you're definitely gonna have a breadstick, though, right.  eventually. i just wanna relax for a minute.  you know what's relaxing.  boy, chewin' on a breadstick.  oh. ii'm sorry.   rats.  hey, cody.  ohh.  what ya doin'.  nothin'.   how did you find me.  you left a diagram.  oh.  look, cody, i know you're having a tough time with this, all right, but stealing the ring isn't gonna stop mom from marrying harvey if she wants to.  i'm telling you, harvey is not the right guy for mom.  why.  ..  ..  you know.  you got a point there.  ok, so he's perfect, but let him go be perfect with somebody else's mom.  we're doing just fine on our own.  so this isn't so much about him.  it's more about you.  you kind of like things just the way they are.  yeah, just mom, zack, and me.   and daddy.  of course.  look, buddy, i understand how you feel.  i'mchange is hard, but it's a part of life.  you know, your mom spends her whole life putting you guys first.  i know. i know.  ..  he makes her happy, don't you think maybe it's time to put her first.  i guess.  that's my boy.  fine. let's get out of here.  besides, it kind of stinks.  sorry.  ah. am i too late. did she say yes.  i haven't asked her yet. why not.  because i put the ring on the breadstick, and she won't have a breadstick.  you're not marrying the breadstick.  you're marrying her.  so take the ring off of the breadstick and put it on her finger like this.  ooh, that's lovely.  now ohoh.  what do you mean, "ohoh".  it's stuck.  how could it be stuck.  well, i have a very slim figure, but disproportionately chubby fingers.  just get some butter.  they never brought any.  .  ohh. i have to talk to the staff.  no, not now. here she comes.  mr. moseby, what are you doing here.  just here to lend a hand.  carey, there's, uh, something i wanna give you.  you wanna give me mr. moseby.  no. iit's the ring.  ..  oh. yes.  and i wanna spend the rest of my life with you.  will you marry me.  i don't know what to say.  no matter what cody says, i want you and harvey to get married.  what are you talking about.  cody's not even here.  mom, i need to talk to you.  cody, you're here.  and kurt. hi.  i guess we should've gotten a bigger table.  mom, i realize now i was wrong to say that harvey wasn't right for you.  you never told me that.  well, i told everyone else.  he did. yes.  we were up in the vent, and we were talking.  anyway, if you wanna marry harvey, you have my permission.  thank you. zack: yes.  harvey, wonderful. congratulations.  yes. yes.  whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. timeout.  there's
