by himself.  ok.  moseby, i have been here 5 minutes, and i am not impressed.  i assure you, there will be no more surprises.  aah. rats.   starting now.  moseby, in my 20 years as a hotel inspector,

keys.  your goldplated tipton badge.  not the badge.  your tipton tie.  i feel compelled to disclose that i am wearing custommade tipton boxer shorts.  dryclean them and send them back.  oh, poor mr. moseby.  yeah.  but what are the odds there are 2 rats downstairs and we have 2 rats upstairs.  they are upstairs, aren't they.  welloh.  i mean, they were in my pocket when we got back from the game.  they must've snuck out when we got to the hotel.  you ruined our science experiment.  and more importantly, you may have ruined mr. moseby.  zack, you better think about you just did.  you may have cost the man his job.  here, bonnie. here, clyde.  it's been a whole week.  i don't think this cheese is working.  muriel, what is this.  mmm. gorgonzola.  you want some. there's more under the couch.
