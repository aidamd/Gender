  armando, you simply ..  daddy, i need you to get rid of a girl.  send her to one of our oil rigs in the north atlantic or better yet, our guano mines in peru.  the point is i never want to see her again and i want her to suffer.   oh, sorry, ma'am.  wrong number.   daddy, i need you to get rid of .  wasn't that rock climbing wall asome.  yeah, once i found a place to keep my corn chips.  want one.  maybe later.  you know, i love girls, but i forgot how much fun it was just to hang out with my buddy.  elmer bud.  budopotamus.  boom.  boom.  you know, girls are just so high maintenance.  i mean, would you mind if i showed up late.  i'd still think you're great.  and if i didn't comb my hair.  i wouldn't care.  and if i didn't compliment on how you dress.  i couldn't care less.  i plus you never nag, you pay your own way and i never have to guess what you're thinking.  doughnuts.  doughnuts.   hey, woodpile, there's an air band contest tomorrow night.  cool, let's enter.  okay.  00 and we'll practice.  do you really think we need practice.  yes.  and a broom.  oh my gosh, thank you so much.   good news.  like you didn't know.  i just got a call from your dad.  he saw a picture of you and is making you the new tipton spokes model.  actually the new mrs. tipton.  he proposed.  wow, he switched that up on me.  either way, you're leaving, right.  yes, your dad wants me to meet him immediately.  but i have to go tell armando.  no no no.  i mean, i'll tell him.  well, what about the show.  don't worry about it.  i'll take care of everything.  now you've got a helicopter to catch.  mom.    goodbye.  thank you.  and now please welcome the lovely karina.  karina.  don't you mean the even lovelier londina.  um, sure.    what are you doing here.  i wanted to be close to you.  aren't you happy to see me.  sure, but where's karina.  karina who.  my assistant.  oh, i don't know.  i looked everywhere.  that's why i'm here to help.  now let's do some magic together.  stab me.  i can't bear to look.  i think we should start with something a little less sharp.  less sharp than london.  good luck with that.  and now armando's amazing sketchpad of mystery.  hand me my sketchpad.  okeydoke.  oh, do you want the bowling ball that goes with it.  oh.  ahhh.  that's the floor show.  and now for the magical doves of shangrila.  oh yeah, that reminds me.  i found a whole bunch of birdies backstage in your pants and i let them go.  now let's see the magical dove trick.  i can't do it now.  why not.  because you let the birds go.  so just make some more with some magic.  i can't, it's a trick.  hence the term magic trick.  wait, you mean none of this is real.  of course not.  there's no such thing as magic.    oh, great.  now you woke up the rabbit.    hey, buddy.  ready to rehearse.  yup, i was ready 30 minutes ago when we were supposed to rehearse.  i had to get my air guitar back.  my imaginary friend borrowed it.   okay okay.  i was shooting hoops with fred.  well, isn't that nice for fred.  meanwhile he's not entering a contest tomorrow with a woeful lack of preparation.  how much preparation do we need.  we play invisible instruments.  we're basically mimes without makeup.  it's not just the practice.  it's you being thoughtless.  you could've called.  i could have, but i didn't think it was that big a deal.  okay, not a big deal.  all right.  so suddenly my feelings just aren't a big deal for you.  what is the matter with you.  nothing.  nothing at all.  are we having our first fight.  it's not a fight.  it's a conversation.  it's a lousy conversation.  you know, when we first started hanging out you were fun.  but now it's just nag nag nag.  now let's just practice our stupid act.  i will not be spoken to like that.  i don't even know who you are anymore.  and as of now, this is no longer a power duo.  this is a power oneo. out.  fine.  fine.  fine, be that way.  you forgot your guitar.   ow.  i am so sorry that little billy was traumatized by our magic show.  however, at 17 you'd think he'd have more control over his emotions.   hello.  moseby, i need to talk to you about armando.  oh, yes.  you would like some advice on how to apologize to him.  apologize.  but he yelled at me in front of all those people and a bunny.  plus, he broke my heart.  well, you broke his toe.  so you're even.  i want you to fire him.  what.  out of a canon.  all right, that is it.  come on, sit down.  sit.  don't talk.  and listen.  now i am not going to fire armando.  i mean, you're the one who ruined the show.  by the way, what happened to his real assistant.  oh, don't worry about her.  she's in a better place.   london, you didn't.  oh, don't get your hanky in a twist.  i just wanted daddy to get rid of her, but i forgot he was between wives.  so now she's ..  14.  so because you have a problem with an employee, you feel it's okay to just make them disappear.  yes.  it's surprisingly easy.  do you have a problem with that.  no, of course not.  yes.  yes, london, i do.  that is no way to deal with people.  that's what daddy does.  he says all is fair in love and war.  not when you hurt the one that you love.  look, london, with all due respect to your father, there was a better way to handle this situation.  you should have just been honest with armando.  well, he wasn't honest with me.  he pretended he was magic but there was no real magic at all.  okay, maybe the real magic is in how you two feel about each other.  well, he did make me feel like i was walking on air.  see.  and you wouldn't want something like that to just disappear, now would you.  no.  so go talk to him.  work this thing out.  you know what, moseby.  you're right.  and i can't wait to call daddy and tell him you think he's wrong.  no.  okay, no no.  daddy, moseby thinks you're stupid and wrong.  oh, sorry again, ma'am.   oh, no no.  moseby.     all right.  next up, the fake musical stylings of cody martin and bailey pickett.    i would just like to point out that what i'm playing is not a harp.  it in fact a clarsach ghaelach, a medieval celtic instrument.  i can understand if you guys were confused because the two instruments are very similar in size and shape.   we're losing 'em.  oh, you never had 'em.  go.  and now for our next act, smash and trash.   actually it's just smash.  i put trash out on the curb.      . when i'm with my best friend .  . i feel a warm wind blow .  . and when we buy a doughnut .  . we both pony up the dough .  . but friends are not forever .  . that's just the way things go .  . 'cause it's tough to make an angel .  . in the hard .. .    ladies and gentlemen, trash fink.   i touched him.  i touched him.   woody, you came back.  because i was wrong.  i should have been more thoughtful.  well, i also overreacted.  i mean, i guess i was just really vulnerable and unappreciated.  now i know how sarah felt.  it's tanya.  whatever.  but all that matters is that the power duo is back together.  by the way, i love the hat.    armando, can we talk.  i'm kind of busy, so make it fast.  okay, i'm really sorry for ruining your act, losing your birds, making those kids crynot that fast.  .. was... me...  .. got...  .. ofmy assistant, i know.  i got the wedding invitation.  they've rented out new zealand.  hmm, australia must have been booked.  i just don't understand.  why would you get rid of karina.  ..  because i felt threatened.  i mean, karina's so tall and beautiful.  and she can fit into a teeny tiny box.  london, karina is just my assistant.  you're the one i really like.  still.  of course.  if you weren't, would i give you all these diamonds.    you're so funny.  can you do that with real diamonds.  not on what your dad's paying me.  oh.  oh, it's almost time for your show.  i don't know how i'm gonna do it without an assistant.  you have an assistant.  look, london.  mmhmm.  you're pretty, you're sweet, you're charming, but you're the worst assistant in the history of magic.  i'm not talking about me.  i got you a new assistant.  and she's a real cutie.  wait.  you're not gonna see her as a threat, are you.  i'll try not to.  dominique.  tadah.   watch it, girlie.  oh, hey.  i'll bet you can fit in the box standing up.  thank goodness woody and zack made up.  now it's just the two of us alone under the stars enjoying a little quiet time.      how do you do that.  i just walked up behind you.  oh.  worldwide , national broadcasting company,nbc productions, , the cocacola company, and 1994 nci caption club/grantsmanship are you busy, will.  no, not really.  so, what's up.  well, they're kind of having cheerleader tryouts at school, and i sort of thought about going, but that's kind of stupid, so i sort of blew it off.  ..ha ha...  ..  .. good idea.  i have a chance.  of course.  yo, back in philly, the girls had this cheer that really got the crowd hyped.  they used to be like this.   we beat 'em    we dissed 'em    we kicked their
