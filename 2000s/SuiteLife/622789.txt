gown ..  obviously capri.  are you crazy.  london's dress is made of silk interwoven with 200 carats of rare pink diamonds.  plus she called me her little boo boo.  and thus by balancing classic keynesian economics with the best of malthusian theory, we can decrease thirdworld debt while increasing our gross domestic product.  boring.  i love puppies.  okay, london, if you could have any historical figure for dinner, who would it be and why.  good question.  but i would not have anyone for dinner, because i feel that eating people is wrong.  even if they are historical and already dead, it just seems gross.  ..  it's not exactly the answer we were looking for.  oh, fine.  santa claus.  i bet he tastes like candy canes and pudding.   london, whoo.  moseby: now let's continue the talent portion of our competition.  ah, capri's up next.  i bet her talent's hot.  four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty and

tractor before i could ride a bike .  . my very first date took me to the theater .  . that boy's biggest dream was to grow the best 'tater .  . but i wanted to be much more than a farmhand's wife .  . so i packed up my bag and i headed for the water .  . they all waved goodbye to their little farmer's daughter .  . i was setting sail for the best time of my life .  . now i'm picking apples at the sistine chapel .  . bailing hay on the champselysees .  . i'm a country girl in every country of the world .  . now i'm shucking corn where shakespeare was born .  . i'm eating grits at the great

think your pageant turned out rather well, even if it did start out as a depraved scam to meet girls.  .  so you faked this whole thing just so you guys could check us out.  sure, now she gets smart.
