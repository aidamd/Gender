about bowling.   that was odd.  well, it was arwin.   so, moseby, do you have a bowling team.  give me just one second.  staff, huddle up.  ok, who's good at bowling.  i am. my average is 225.  good.

the chattychat.  ho, ho.  we're bowling.   esteban.  you're facing the wrong way.  oh, this the way we do it in my country.  well, that's the dumbest thing i've ever heard.  why don't youwelcome to the team.  cody, have you seen arwin.  i asked him if he wanted to come bowling.  what did he say.   zack, you're up.   zack, you really are good.  tip of the iceberg, baby.  carey.  i think we have a pretty decent team except for one glaring weakness.  oh, i got a split.  and i've decided to name you captain.  well, you are the mother of our star bowler, and you're pretty good yourself.  and you want me to tell london she's off the team.  and you're quick as a whip.  good luck with that.  so, london, we've got our team set.  oh, goody. tell me about me.  shh. this is a team secret.   you get to be our alternate.  is that good.  good.  it's great.  it means that if somebody else can't bowl, you get to be our secret weapon.  ohh.  well, can i still wear my cheerleading outfit.  you can wear whatever you want.  yay, me.  shh. shh.   yay, me.  won't you throw the ball.  oh, is the little dutch boys the best you can do.  spying on us.  i don't need to spy on you because you stink.  ve bowl

speaking of milking things, i need you to do my current events homework.  mr. moseby wants me to rest my golden arm.  well, you better get the newspaper first, because you're doing your own stinkin' homework.  fine, fine, fine.  but if i pull a finger muscle, it's on your head.  well, it's better than where it usually is, up your nose digging for gold.  that's funny.  hey, check it out.  there's some loser in the hall in a towel.  no way. who is it.  you.  uhh.  hey, let me in.  zack.  can't believe you fell for it again.  he did it differently this time.  well, he's never gonna do it again.

nothing.  i'd go with no allowance.  that and i'm grounding you for the month.  what.  you are not to leave this hotel, except for school.  but what about the bowling tournament tomorrow.  you'll let me out of grounding for that, won't you.  grounding doesn't have exceptions except for school.  but the team needs me.  well, you should have thought of that before you disobeyed me.  ..  you're the
