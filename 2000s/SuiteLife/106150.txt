his money, and then wound up living with maah.  good morning to you, too.  hey, this wasn't here when i went to bed.  oh, granny always checks on us during the night.  must've looked a little cold to her.  how much should i tip her.  you don't tip family.  ..  well, because they're family.  we all love each other in this house.  man: aw, gee, where's the remote.  woman: same place as your careerin the toilet.  love can be expressed in all kinds of ways.  ok, it's time to strip and make the bed.  ok, if that's what poor people do.  whoa there, big girl.  i meant strip the sheets off the bed and put on new ones.  oh.  well, what's the maid gonna do.  we don't have a maid.  aah.  oh, i am so stressed out.  have you thought about getting a job.  no. i've been too depressed about being poor.  you wanna sit for zack and cody tonight.  but don't you need the money.  right now, you need the money more than i do.  hey, that felt great to say.   that right. aah.  perfect.  is this how all poor people sleep.    hey, i was watching wrestling. since when.  you're not zack. it's homework time.  first, you take away my identity and now my culture.  he's been acting like me all day.  he came on to all the girls at school, wised off to the teachers, and now he wants to copy my homework.  that's terrible.  i know. it means i have to do my own homework.   oh, hi, london. ok, nobody's had any dinner.  doctor's number's on the fridge, firstaid kit's in the cabinet, and in a super emergency, i'll be singing right downstairs.  were you talking to me.  remember, like i said, i'll be singing right downstairs.  mwaah. love you.  love you. love you.   time for bed.  it's 7:30.  and we haven't even had dinner yet.  we want grilled cheese, please.  i do that in the kitchen, right.  yeah, it's the place with the fridge.  your fridge is broken.  other side.  fixed it.  i'm confused. i thought you hated cheese.  but you love cheese.  oh.  ooh, they're already in little slices.  cooking is easy.  so if i'm zack and i don't like cheese, does that mean you're the one who likes ham.  no, we both like ham.  then who likes liverwurst. no one.  then why do they make it.  the sandwiches will be ready soon.  do you want me to read you guys a story.  no. good.  i've got this working thing down.   oh, must be the cooking timer.  i've got the window.   your grilled cheeses are ready.  next time, you might wanna put it on bread.  and you might wanna take off the plastic.  let's face it, i'm not cut out for regular life.  yeah, you are. you need to practice at it.  so you're saying i should make more grilled cheeses.  no. no.  why don't we start with something easier.  like cereal.  i can do t wait, what goes first, the milk or the cereal.  doesn't matter, as long as you remember the bowl.  thanks for the hot chocolate, mrs. fitzpatrick.  you're welcome, sweetheart.  i like them.  they're kind of embarrassing sometimes.  i didn't know families sat down and ate dinner together every night.  and you actually talk to each other.  oh, they went out.  i had dinner with whatever nanny my mom hired that week.  since they usually didn't speak english, things were pretty quiet.  that's kind of sad.  i learned how to say, "let me stay up late, or i'm calling immigration" in 18 different languages.  hey, wanna watch the game. sure.  ok.   you know, this is my first sleepover.  you've never slept over at another girl's house before.  most of my weekends, i was flying back and forth from mommy to daddy.  i slept on the plane and played cards with the flight attendant.  does that count.  sure.  .. mmhmm.  i've always been a little jealous of you.  but now i see that you missed out on a lot.  i mean, no sleepovers.  but i know how to act. i've seen the movies.  we eat junk food, we do each other's hair, and we talk about boys.  yeah, that's just about it.  ow.  what are you doing.  pillow fight. it's in all the movies.  see, i can be a regular person.  hey, regular person, would you like a snack.  sure.  yo, sal, send up some peanuts.  and caviar.  regular person.  yo, caviar. )
