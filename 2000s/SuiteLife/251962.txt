 ealth foods.  you're killin' us.  now, you boys should be grateful to eat food made by your mother.  you might want to taste it before you say that.  areare youare you inviting me to dinner.  oh, that is so sweet, really, but you know what. i shouldn't impose.  ..  see.  arwin, we would be delighted if you would stay for dinner.  oh. i almost forgot.  mother always says, "  ..  ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  cleanplate club. i get dessert.  in your face.  actually, it's on your face.  man, that wheat loaf.  just goes right through me.   carey, can i help you with the dishes.  why, thank you, arwin.  how thoughtful of you.  i always used to do 'em with mother.  she'd wash, i'd dry.  she'd tell me i missed a spot and then smack me with the dishtowel.  oh, i miss her.  mom, smack him with a dishtowel.  i'm not going to do that.  well, maybe arwin can stay here tonight.  great idea.  hey, arwin.  you can stay here tonight, can't you.  yeah, can't you.  please, mom, please. please, mom, please.  but he doesn't have his pajamas.  yes, i do.  you wear your pajamas under your clothes.  well, if i wore them over my clothes, you'd think i was weird.  ok, i guess one night wouldn't hurt, but it's lights out for everybody at 10:00.  10 o'clyes. i get to stay up an extra 2 hours.  here's your change, sir, and i hope you were satisfied with your excellent service.  thanks.  10 more of those, and i can put a down payment is a 5star hotel.  yeah, and that's a 5star cheapskate.  ..  moseby. lance just dumped me.  throw him in the tipton dungeon.  for the last time, we don't have a dungeon.  well, then what's that room in the bottom of the hotel.  that's the basement.  well, if that's the basement, then why is there a firebreathing dragon in it.  that's the furnace.  uncle marion, this is girl talk.  why don't you go feed the dragon.  aha. so there is a dragon.  you know, london, i've been dumped before.  oh, there's a shock.  i'm not like you.  i've never been the dumpee.  i've always been the dumper.  one more crack, and you're gonna be in the dumpster.  this just doesn't make any sense.  i mean, why would anyone want to break up with me.  you're selfish, superficial, don't really listen to anybody.  no. can't think of a thing.  i need someone to snoop, pry, and weasel information out of him.  well, i can snoop and pry, ..  weaseling's gonna cost ya.  oh. how about a diamond necklace.  that'll work.  see.  now, that's a tip.    both: good night, mom.  ahem.  good night, arwin.  hey, uh, kiss the sock monkey.  hey, are you gonna read a story.  mother always reads me a story.  yeah, mom used to read us stories, too.  then we turned 6.  you're never too old for a classic.  the little engineer that could.  it's about a hotel engineer that thought he couldn't fix something, and then he can.   you saw the movie.  wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  "once upon a time, there was a hotel engineer.  i'm a hotel engineer, he said"no, no, no, no. ddo the voice.  what voice.  the hotel engineer voice.   it sounds like this.  "i'm a hotel engineer, he said.  "i have lots of" that's it.  that's thethat's the voice. that's it.  "i have lots of tools.  "i have screwdrivers and hammers "and pliers and wrenches and saws and clamps and"arwin, does this book just list tools.   arwin.  hey, hey, wait.  you forgot nails and screwsok, ok, ok, ok.   how come you and i have never had a nice long chat.  because you said i creep you out.  oh, you took that to heart.  so i heard you and london broke up.  uh, how come.  oh, you know, i really don't like to talk about my private life, 'cause if i do, ..  private.  you like yummy worms.  it's my favorite worm snack.  ..why did you break up with her.  i met someone else.  so, what's her name.  you know, i really don't feel comfortable talking about wanda.  and where did you meet her.  i don't see how it really matters.  at the halibut hangout.  she's a hostess/mermaid.  you're dating a mermaid.  oh, i'm sorry.  merperson.  yeah, whatever.  you guys want dessert.  i made cauliflower cobbler.  ha ha ho.  you know what, though.  i am totally wiped out.  arwin kept waking me up to check under his bed for monsters.  and when arwin's not awake, he sings in his sleep.  ..  "left flange.  ..  flush valve"well, that could be annoying.  oh, i'm not finished yet.  ..  "3/4inch rubberized tank gasket.  " well, arwin's back at his house, and tonight we'll all catch up on our sleep.   hey. i'm here to fix that flushing sink.  uh, uh, iiit's ok.  it can wait till tomorrow.  oh, that's perfect.  i'll just sleep over again and get a fresh start in the morning.  oh.  i forgot the p.j.s.  a mermaid. he's dating a mermaid.    you're pretty strong for someone who's never lifted a finger.  oh. this is terrible.  how could i possibly compete with a mermaid.  she could take him to the underwater city of atlantis.  he's always wanted to go there.  london, i'm guessing she's not an actual mermaid.  i'm not paying you to guess.  is she or isn't she.  " so if she's not a mermaid, i can still get him back.  i want you to find that fake fishgirl and have her in the lobby when lance comes to work on saturday.  you know, that would be a lot easier if, uh, i had some earrings to match my new necklace.  oh, that makes sense. here.  when she sees me in lance's arms, that waterlogged wench will swim away with her tail between her legs.  how you gonna get lance back in your arms.  where there's a gill, there's a way.  sit up. sit up.good dog.  carey, can you make me a rhinoceros pancake like mother doesdid.  comin' right up.  get rid of him.  you know, arwin, it has been absolutely awesome having you here ..week.  it's only been 3 days.  really. only 3 days.  mmhmm.  but it's been packed with a week's worth of fun.  look, arwin, you have this great opportunity at home.  you have an awesome bachelor pad now that your mother's gone, mother's gone.  where's my rhinoceros pancake.  ok, ok, ok. here.  that's not a rhinoceros.  that's a hippo.  i didn't have enough batter for the horn.   there, there.  what i was trying to say is, at home, you could have a party every night with lots of cute girls.  everything there reminds me of mother.  so just throw it all out.  you mean throw away her knickknacks.  ..or...or...  we can just pack up her knickknacks and put 'em in a box.  we're gonna need a bigger box.  there are, like, what, maybe a thousand owls in here.  yeah, well, you know, mother took most of 'em with her ..  arwin, don't all these eyes starin' at you all the time kinda creep you out.  justyou really just can't look 'em in the eyeeye.  look, arwin. this is gonna be great.  you could change this apartment completely.  you mean take out all these owls and replace them with something cool, likelike squirrels.  you know, as good as that idea is'cause i saw this squirrel clock.  and every hour, a cute little squirrel comes out and bangs walnuts together.  that's awesome, but i was thinkin' more like a pool table, or air hockey, a bigscreen tv, things girls like.  oh, i see where you guys are goin' with this, but, uh, i don't see any girl knockin' on my door any time soon.   hi, arwin. do you have any sugar.  nope.  arwin, wasn't that a girl.  oh, iiyep.  then why did you slam the door in her face.  why should i give her my sugar.  because you might get some "sugar" back.  well, if she just gives me the same sugar back, then what's the point.  this is ridiculous.  well, it's the only way i can get lance back.  now put on a little diver's outfit and stand by the treasure chest.  no, i will not do it.  now get out of there immediately or i will call your father.  then i can mention to him you called in sick to attend that pockethanky convention.   swim safely.  but i will need norman, my bearded doorman, back.  fine. but i'm keeping the bellhop.   hey, london.  hey, sailor.  london.  you look beautiful.  did you do something different with your hair.  no, i'm a mermaid. see my tail. look.  aah. ow, i fell on my booty.  aaaah.  london.  are you ok.   i'm ok now.  i told you it was over between you and lance.  i can't believe he's twotailing me.  well, believe it, honey.  he's back with london.  that's what you think.  aaah.  wanda.  are you ok, my little angel fish.  get your h you bottomfr.  no. no, no. you don't understand.  ii was just helping her up.  yeah, right.  how could you have thrown yourself all over that stringyhaired squid.   oh, no, she didn't.  what.  who you callin' stringyhaired, you scalyskinned freak.  mmhmm.  at least my sea shells aren't fake.  oh, now, that's cold.  oh, it's on.  bring it.      so much for that barracuda.  oh, yeah, blowfish.   what do you think we should do.  i don't know about you, but i'm takin' pictures for the global inquirer.  no need for a lawsuit, wanda.  put a little tartar sauce on it, and your recovery will go swimmingly.  how is she.  mmm. slightly strained fin.  i didn't mean for it to go that far.  i just wanted to win you back.  but why.  i mean, did you really think that some day we were gonna get married and have guppies.  of course not. all you like to do is swim.  well, all you like to do is shop.  hello. shopping.  hello. swimming.  i guess the truth is, you're a water sign and i'm a dollar sign.  lance.  i think we need to break up.  but i already brokedon't make this harder than it needs to be.  butstop begging.  i don't knowit's over.  but whenplease.  let's just end this with a little dignity.  wow.  my eye for color is astounding.  you know, i really think this place is gonna help arwin, i don't know, grow up.  arwin.  what are you doing.  nothing. i was just waiting for mister squirrel.  it's almost 6:00.  that clock was so not part of my vision.  so, what should we do first to break in my new bachelor pad, huh.  i was thinkin' a foosball tourney.  then we'll fire up the buffalowing maker.  ooh, i have this new ranch dip recipe that i've been dying to try out.  great.  i mean, how could things get any better.   excuse me.  sorry to bother you, but i was thinking, since your mother moved out, you might be needing a nice, homecooked meal.  it's lasagna.  i've layered the cheeses alphabetically.  asiago, brie, cheddar, doppelrhamstufel, edam, feta, gorgonzolano, thanks.  i'm doppelrhamstufel intolerant.  arwin.  ..  won't you come in, enid.  and bring your multitude of cheeses.  wow.  this place looks amazing.  thank you. thank you.  oh, i love this squirrel clock.  huh.  and it's so nice not having those beady, vicious eyes watching your every move. grrr.  yeah, those owls could get a little creepy.  oh, no. i was talking about your mother.  no offense. oh, none taken.  she did have a habit of never blinking.  ..  handsome tonight, arwin.  oh. thank you, enid.  iii like the way the tape on your glasses matches your shoes.   who's up for some foosball.  i need a goalie.  shouldn't you guys be headin' home.  it's gettin' a little late, isn't it.  no.  00, and you still haven't tried the dip.  you're the dip.  don't you see that they want to be alone.  ..  our little arwin is grown up.  so, enid.  we're, uh, finally alone.  i know.  hey, norman. nice outfit.  love the pitchfork.  thank you, boys.  it's a trident, and i think he's supposed to be neptune.  i think he'sfrom neptune.  by the way, zack, what did you dowith all those owls.  oh, i found a homefor them.   aah. aaaah.  captioning made possible bydisneyabc cable networks group captioning performed bythe national captioning institute, inc.  sorry, kids, don't be upset, but i have to cancel wizard class today.  yay.  yes.  because you have so many chores to do.   seriously, you have a lot of chores to do.  oh, good.  recycling is on the list.  uhuhuh. and one of the best things about recycling is...  ...you get to use it again.   mother.  you told us to never take things out of the garbage.  food. and i was talking to your dad.  these kids do not know how to eat a chicken leg.  there's another side.  dad, you know i love chores because alex hates them.  but i can't do them today.  i wanted to surprise you, i'm gonna say it anyway, but i've been working on my own spell for wizard certification.  i am.  oh, please.  wizard certification.  that sounds like something people would make up who aren't very good at making things up.  my son, justin vincenzo pepe russo.  i've always wanted my own spell.   pepe. i can't get enough of that.  it makes fun of itself.  pepe.  this is so exciting.  i want you to focus on the spell.  alex and max will handle your chores.  i can't do all these.  harper and i are going to creature feature confidential tonight.  they project a scary movie on a side of a building.  oh, cool.  what movie.  that's what makes it confidential.  no one knows the movie or the location until you get the texts.  well, that's hardly more important than justin creating an original spell.  thank you, dad.  oh, and alex, when you vacuum the rug, try to leave a vertical light/dark pattern.  mom loves that.  i really do.  . well, you know everything's gonna be a breeze .  . that the end will no doubt justify the means .  . you can fix any problem with the slightest of ease .  . yes, please .  . but you might find out it'll go to your head .  . when you write a report on a book you never read .  . with the snap of your fingers you can make your bed .  . that's what i said .  . everything is not what it seems .  . you can get all you wanted in your wildest dreams .  . you might run into trouble if you go to extremes .  . because everything is not what it seems .  . everything is not what it seems .  . when you can have what you want by the simplest of means .  . be careful not to mess with the balance of things .  . because everything is not .  . what it seems .  wow. justin, )
