 i'm bailey, and you must be cody.  or you can call me the guy you've been waiting for.  you're not him.  one day i hope to find a fella who's got a soft heart but is tough enough to work the landand moving on.  i'm going to hit on those girls at the hot tub.  but stay close in case it doesn't work out.  still blocking the view.  you see.  his manners are deplorable.  i hope you don't invite him to your birthday party.  no way.  oh, and good newswe're gonna have balloons shaped like famous figures from european history, including lady godiva.  oh.  will there be any girls there that won't float away.  oh, he's coming back.  nobody mention my birthday party.  struck out.  apparently those girls n't like goodlooking, masculine types.  zack, you might have a shot over there.  so what are we talking about.  zack's birthday party.  oops.  really.  my birthday's coming up too.  i'm going to be 16 this saturday.  really.  so will i.  where were you born.  seattle.  so was i.  what hospital.  st. joseph's.  so was i.  what time.  6:40.  i was born at 6:30.  whoa, for a second there it was getting a little spooky.  it still is spooky.  you look alike.  you were born in the same place do you know what this means.  you two must bealiens.  no, twins.  both: twins.  twin aliens.  bye, mom.  bye, dad.  bye, dad.  bye, mom.  how can mom not tell me i have a twin.  quit complaining.  look what i got.  i mean, how could they do this.  dad said when they got divorced they split everything.  mom got you and the matching luggage.  and dad got me and the amplifier.  mom said they always meant to get us together, but it never happened.  i just can't believe i have a twin.  i mean, we're nothing alike.  i'm cool.  you're nerdy.  i'm tough.  you're weak.  i'm goodlooking.  ..  ugh.  i look just like you.  but on you it doesn't work.  ignoring that.  since we are brothers, i guess we should start hanging out.  do you want to see my coin collection.  as tempting as that sounds, i've got a better idea.  i say we hit up the neptune clubel clubo neptuno.  that's 18 and over.  don't sweat it.  according to my license i'mi mean, we're 23.  your middle name is "thunder".  cool.  then i'll be " more like lightning dolt.  goodness, these ripped jeans sure are breezy.  now that you look like a dude instead of a dork, let's go find us some dates.  oh, i already have somebody.  it's bailey.  you're dating that babe.  well, i will be.  i have a sixmonth plan to woo her.  how many months has it been.  nine.  right, well, how about until that works out, we find us some college girls in the club.  i don't know.  i'm not really good at talking to girls.  look, just remember, you're in charge.  picture yourself as a hungry jungle cat, and that girl over there is a deer with a limp.  actually, jungle cats and deer are not indigenous to the same area.  maybe an impala would better suit that metaphor can pygmy goat..  just show her you're an animal.  now give me a growl.   i swallowed my breath mint.  i'll handle the growling.  now let's go save us an injured deer.  the mint is back.  whoa.  i swear that was my trucker's license.  i don't think he bought it, thunder.  either way, thanks for the most exhilarating night of my life.  we were only in there for 15 minutes.  and you were in the bathroom for 10 of them.  still, i did get to talk to a college girl.  you helped her with her math.  i know.  she held my calculator.  i never had so much fun multiplying with anyone.   oh.  30 on a school night.  we should probably hit the sack.  not so fast.  there are parties all over this boat.  i don't know.  i'm not really a party kind of guy.  who knew you could have this much fun on a cruise ship.  everyone but you.  ol.  ay, cinco.  okay, we're all agreed that zack's souffl thing is lame, right.  beyond lame.  pizza says party.  ..   okay, so let's throw him a surprise party instead.  that way he can't nerd it up.  ooh, i love surprise parties.  but don't tell me about it because i want to be surprised.  la la la la la la.  maybe we canmaybe we can convince moseby to let us use the sky deck for zack's surprise party.  that would be good.  but what do we do about his evil twin cody.  throw him out the sewage flap.  but that's mean.  it's his 16th birthday too.  you're right.  we'll sing "happy birthday," give him some cake, then throw him out the sewage flap.  bailey: look, we all agree that cody is an obnoxious, sexist jerk with no regard for anyone elss feelings.  but he is zack's brother, and since zack is our friend, we owe it to him to try to tolerate cody.  can you guys speak up.  i can't hear a word you're saying.  wow, this is like little headphones without the music.  oh, come on, it's our birthday.  turn that frown ..  or not.   it's another "happy birthday" text.  this one's from my weaving club, the loomatics.  wow, that's the 12th one just since you've stepped into the elevator.  you probably don't get good reception out at sea.  yeah, i'm sure that's it.  so why do you think moseby wanted to see us on the sky deck.  he probably heard about our flamenco dance and wanted to see our tango.   okay, guys, get ready.  all: happy birthday, zack.  and cody.   cody.  wow, thanks guys.  this is amazing.  we thought it might be a little more festive than just a dinner.  not that your idea was lame.  it was lame.  happy birthday, man.  okay.  and we did incorporate some of your ideas.  say bonjour to napoleon balloonaparte.  he is awesome.  and this looks like my lower intestines.  thanks, guys.  i'm so touched.  i'll get you a tissue.  hypoallergenic, please.  hey, bailey, i gotta ask you a question.  if this is one of your cheesy pickup lines, why don't we skip to the point where i slap you.  well, i just wanted your opinion on what i should get zack for his birthday.  wait, what.  i wanted to get zack something special for his loom, but i'm not exactly sure what a loom is.  you're serious.  yeah, i seriously don't know what a loom is.  no, i mean, you really want to do something nice for your brother.  of course.  i mean, not only is he my twin, but he's not a bad guy.  must be why he has so many good friends like you.  are we having a moment.  maybe so.  no, we can't. )
