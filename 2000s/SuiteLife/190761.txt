form.   whoo. coming, sir.  since i know you don't read my memos, you may not be aware that i am now a supervillain.  and i have decided to make you my evil minion.   never.  what is a minion.  it means henceforth you will do whatever i say.  well, i do that now.  now dance.   now slap yourself.  ooh. ooh. ooh.  now pick your nose.  heh heh heh.  it's good to be the meanager.  oh, you found out about your nickname.  . never mind.  so, now that i've been promoted from bell boy to evil minion, do i get a sidekick name.  oh, yes.  from this day forward, you will be known ..  bell boy.  ok, that sounds like a lateral move to me.   man, these superhero costumes are super itchy.  why do we gotta wear them under our clothes.  you have to.  it's one of the rules.  where is this rule book. i want to read it.  super rules for super heroes.  oh ho ho, that's a big book.  i may have super speed, but i still read at a thirdgrade level.  did that sign look suspicious to you.  it went by so fast, i couldn't read it.  arwin:..  here's your evil ray gun.  i call it the adultifier.   da da da   ho ho ho.  wow. i like it.  mr. moseby: the adultifier.  ..   da da da   oh, yeah.   well, it'sit's not working.  oh, yeah, you need diamonds to power it.  diamonds. yeah.  big diamonds.  oh, yes, good choice.  heh heh.  at any point, did you consider going with something, i don't know, more affordable, like, say, .  so, what are you gonna do with the adultifier.  it's going to magnify my green ray.  what are we playing, hide and seek.  both: shh.  mr. moseby: i'll show you.  bob, get down.  bob, are you ok.  the name's robert.  ah, the green ray makes suits.  a nice suit, too.  it doesn't make suits.  it turns kids into adults.  dude, he zapped you.  unhand me, you hooligan.  who's little boy is

adultifier, which i will bounce off the tipton satellite, turning every child in the world into a miniadult.  london, don't give him your diamonds.  hey, if i didn't give them up when they held daddy for ransom, i'm certainly not gonna give them up now.  then i will take them.   not while we're here, you won't.  well, if you're here, then who's going to save maddie.  what have you done to her, you fiend.  oh, as we speak, she is being tied to railroad tracks by my evil minion bell boy.  you mean esteban.  whatever.  you go, quick guy.  i'll stop the meanager.  oh, then who's going to save your mother.  you've got our mommy, too.  how could you.  hello. villain.  she is being held by my evil minion the engineer.  you mean arwin.  yeah, i didn't spend a lot of time on the minion names, ok.  coming, maddie.  so let me get this straight.  moseby is a supervillain, and you're his evil minion sent her to kidnap me.  that is the silliest thing i have ever heard.  silence, captive.  on second thought, that is the silliest thing i have ever heard.  hey. did you tie up our counselor.  ..maybe.  we were gonna do that.  yeah.  i hate when that happens.  well, ha. you're too late.  .. huh.  how exactly are you gonna put me in peril.  are there any railroad tracks nearby.  no, but there's a red ant hill outside.  you can bury her in it.  i'll get the shovel. i'll get the honey.  i'll pour it on her.  or you could untie me like the good girls i know you are.  all: nah.   i'm here to save you, maddie.   ..  and esteban.  i thought you were the bell boy.  oh, it didn't catch on.  wow, that was fantastic.  you really do have superpowers.  that's not something a guy lies about, baby.  now, if you'll excuse me, i have to go save the children of the world.  he was cute.  thank you.   you know, uh, you look at little tense.  you know, i could give your shoulders a little massage ifno. what i want is to be let go.  no can do, cupcake. heh heh.  i can make the time pass a little quicker.

was painful being tied up.  don't worry, mom.  i'm a superhero, and i'm here to save you.  aw, great costume, sweetie.  shouldn't you have a sweater.   mom.  superheroes don't wear sweaters.  they do if it's super cold outside.  well, even if you're toasty warm, ..  the engineer.  i don't have to.   oh, great job, honey.  that's my little superhero. mwah.  mom.  not in front of the evil minion.  come on.  not so fast.  hey, arwin, want a kiss.   i knew that song would work.  close your eyes and pucker up.   more diamonds, london. more diamonds.  but this is my favorite. her name is tina.  bye, tina.  stop right there, meanager.  your days of meanaging are over.  well, you're too late.  i just need one more diamond to power up my adultifier.  children of the world, say goodbye to recess and hello to rush hour.  give me the diamond, london.  her name is tina.  fine, give me tina.  there you go.  whwhere'd it go.  heh. all your evil plans are foiled.  here, take cheryl. ha.  not so

no.  the adultifier is powered up.  and the first 2 kids i'm going to use it on are you.  that's what you think.  mirror: hey, i was taking a nap.   if it turns kids into adults, i wonder what it turns adults into.    waaa.   ..  there's your answer.  tina. cheryl.  oh. are you ok.  mommy's sorry.  let's have a little polish, and off to bed.  boys.  mom, we defeated the meanager.  and saved all the children of the world.  well, except for bob.  on the bright side, i hear he has a thriving insurance business.  i say we celebrate with some pizza and video games.  aw, guys, i'm sorry, but the phone's been ringing all night.  apparently a lot of people need your help.  ..  there's a bus on a broken suspension bridgei think i'd start with the giant spider that's climbing city hall.    ooh, he just ate the mayor.   but do we have to do it now.  cheesy's happy pizza place.  i'm sorry, sweetie, but with super power comes super responsibility.  there's no time for kid's stuff.  ok, i guess we'll go.  oh, wait. i gotta get your sweaters.  you know, being a superhero really stinks.  i wish we never made that wish.  wait a minute.  if you run us around the earth at supersonic speed, we could reverse its rotation, thus sending us back in time to the exact moment we saw the shooting star.  great idea.  easy. i didn't get super strength.  i think you ran us back a little too far.   you think.  hop on.    look, i'm telling you, we wished upon a star, we got superpowers, and we saved all the children of the world by defeating moseby and his evil minions.  how could you not remember something like that.  i don't remember it because you dreamt it.  something must've happened when we went through the time vortex.  or you ate 3 pieces of cold pepperoni pizza right before you went to bed.  hello, i do that every night.   look, i'm telling you, arwing built mosebythis adultifier.  aah. there it is.  run before heturns it on you.  wow.  you'd thinkhe'd never seen an atomic toiletplunger before.  heh heh.   captioning made possible bydisneyabc cable networks group captioning performed bythe national captioning institue, inc.  dude, this statue of london is
