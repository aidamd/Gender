" haley, you can come out from under your bag.  you got the nexthighest grade in the class, ..  minus.  i didn't get an "f." whoo hoo.  maybe now grandma will hug me.  zack, nice work.  bless you.  wow.  what'd you get, nerd.  it doesn't matter.  " ha ha ha ha.  shut up. yes, sir.  you should all follow zack's fine example.  this is a student who cares, someone who went the extra mile, someone who didn't quit at the that's lunch.  if anybody needs help opening their pudding, ask zack.  so, guys, any of you wanna share a peanut butter and banana sandwich.  i'll take that as a no.  hey, mr. moseby, have you seen london.  i need a favor from her.  oh. london doing a favor. ha.  that's a good one.  well, it's not a big favor.  i just want her to go on a date with the manager of the paul revere minimart.   so you've seen him.  seen him. ooh.  the savings are coming. the savings are coming.  ooh. heh heh heh.  hey, london. hmm.  do you think you can do me a teensyweensy favor.  no.  you had no idea what i even was gonna say.  you were going to say there's this guy who's obsessed with me because i'm the most amazing person in the world, and he just has to have a date with me.   that's not what i was going to say at all.  ..  ..  works for a fashion magazine.  ooh. which one. i read them all.  it's a new one calledheiress.   ooh, ooh. i'm an heiress.  yes. that's right.  that's why he wants to interview you, but you don't wanna meet him.  who says i didn't wanna meet him.  you.  well, what do i know. set it up.  it's a date, then.  see. easy as pie.   yes.  you've just set up a date, which is not a date, someone thinks is a date, and the other person thinks is an interview.  i mean, what could possibly go wrong.  you're right.  maybe i should be there disguised as a plant.  yeah, that'll fix it.  who here has heard of robert frost.  and, no, he is not a singing snowman in a christmas special.  he is a poet.  " now, from the first line, can anyone tell me what season it is.  paprika.  no, not seasoning.  season, time of year.  zack.  " the leaves are changing. it's autumn.  come on, zack.  you're the only reason i get up in the morning and drag my butt to this monument to ignorance.  what season is it.  baseball season.   no. it's autumn.  it is. that must mean summer school's over.   sit down.  word, bird.  hey, i'm a poet, and i didn't know it.  i can make a rhyme anytime.   me, too. did i mention you have detention.   zack, i don't understand.  you were doing so well. what got into you.  my underwear, and i didn't want it to happen again.  hey. zack, let's go.  he's not going anywhere.  zackary has detention.  detention.  great. now i'm stuck here, too.  listen, young man, you had better not fail out of summer school.  you're runnin' out of seasons.  if you think that i am goingshh. no talking.   he  hey surfers, we're going behind the scenes  of the latest disney movie.  .movie surfers.  hey surfers, welcome to new orleans.  that's right, it's where the new animated adventure the princess and the frog comes alive.  you will enjoy. i guarantee.  so why set the movie here.   well the animators needed a city where alligators love jazz.  .jazz trumpet.   humans get transformed into frogs.  that's new.  and magical adventures might be waiting just around the corner.  new orleans is a wonderful city.   it was a city that lent itself to the magic and the mystery  and the music that we wanted to incorporate.   which is perfect for telling a fairy tale story.  it's beautiful, no.  there's no other place like new orleans.   wow, it's wonderful.  new orleans is also the home of mardis gras.   and elaborate costume balls.   it's a city where anything can happen.  and the food is amazing.  order up.  what just happened.  which makes this city perfect for tiana, the movies hard working heroine.  the princess's ultimate goal is to have her own restaurant.   but she wants to do it her way, and on her terms.  .i'm almost there.  her philosophy is you gotta make your own fairytales come true.   certainly, she's not a character who's waiting  for a prince to rescue her.  so when prince naveen comes around it leads to a whole lot of things that she didn't expect.  you must kiss me.  excuse me.  please, it will make me human.  just one kiss.  unless you beg for more.   so one little tiny kissleads to one masisve adventure.  what did you do to me.   they end up going on a journey together.   it's so much fun.  i could use a little help.  oh, i will play a little louder.  where y'all going.  find someone to break this spell.  the only thing important is what's under the skin.  the princess is what you have inside.  and you can do anything that you set your mind to.   whatever it is that makes your pulse race faster.  go for it.  yeah, you know it.   well surfers, that's just a taste of new orleans and  disney's the princess and the frog  coming to theaters soon.   ok, who here has read the rest of the poem.  did you read it or not, mark.  uh, no.  like i wish we could do with the entire summer, let's skip to the end.  ..  "and ii took the one less traveled by, " what do you think is frost's point. zack.  this should be hilarious.   "two roads diverged ..  "and i took the one less traveled by, " what frost is trying to say isis that life is full of choices, and even though it's easier to go along with what everybody else is doing, going the more difficult way will pay off in the long run.  ha ha ha. good one, zack.  ah ha ha ha ha ha ha.  ha hathat was right.  that was exactly right.  good to have you back, zack.  aw, zack.  you know what. that's it.  look, there's nothing wrong with being smart.  in factand this'll probably shock yououtside these walls, it's considered a good thing.  so go ahead, call me a nerd, but next year, when you're all here, i won't be.  i'll be taking the road less traveled right to the beach.  so who's with me.  apparently no one.  all right, now here's a tip on how to score some megapoints with london.  she loves to talk about herself, so ask her lots of questions, almost like you're interviewing her for your blog.   i was just gonna show off the guns.  bang.  yeah. let's go with my plan.  bonsoir,everyone.  ahh hahh.  thes.s.london has docked.  .." something.  hey, that works. i'm super something.  heh.  london, this is wayne, the guy i was telling you about.  it's a privelege to meet you, london.  i've dreamed about this moment for years.  well, i don't give a facetoface to just anyone, but cody says you're the man in charge.  yep, nights and weekends.  uh, yyeah, yeah. that'sthat's right.  the man never stops workin'.  wayne wants to talk to a beauty, not a cootie.  all right.  you two have fun.  this way.  so, what do you wanna know about me.  oh, i already know everything i need to know.  you're beautiful and rich.  and that's why you chose me. rah. rah.  . ha ha ha ha ha.   ..k.  well, as an heiress, here are some of my favorite things.  me. ha ha.  shouldn't you be writing this down.  uh, ok, if you want me to.  i didn't bring anything to write with.  well, that seems odd, considering youdropped your pen.  uh, in this waiter's pocket.  you know, luckily i came back and found it.  she also loves it when you take notes.  gotcha. thanks.  so you must meet a lot of royalty in your line of work.  we do a lot of business with sal the salami king.   i've never been to salami.  is it beautiful.  ah ha ha ha.  ha. ha. that's really funny.  cody, what are you still doing here.  ..  having dinner.  is this blue cheese.   mark, what are you doin' here.  i'm not here to beat you up.  whew. that's a relief.  actually, i was wonderingbut maybe you don't want to.  but it would be really great ifuh, i don't think so.  what.  if you could do some tutoring.  aren't you nervous that the rest of the class is gonna give you an atomic wedgie if you do well.  nope.  hey.  what's up, zack.  hey, guys. hey, zack.  dude.  wow. lookin' pretty tonight, haley. new bag.  haley: thanks for noticing.  brick.  you're here to study, too.  yeah. i gotta get into high school already.  i mean, i can't deal with those tiny toilets anymore.  well, why don't you all pull up a seat.  now, let's crack open those books, shall we.  so the most important thing to remember is that shakespeare wrote in iambic pentameter.  zack.  sit down and don't disrupt my class again, or i'll give you detention.  hey.  you got a date to the prom yet.  oh, shucks. if only you'd asked me sooner.  so, wayne, how long have you been writing.  i don't know. since i was about 10.  i had prolem with es.  me, too. ha.  but that hasn't stopped your career.  so how's your circulation.  oh, it's pretty good, i guess.  i have naturally low blood pressure, like a jungle cat's. rrrowr.  aaaand that helps you sell magazines.  helps me sell everything.  no one can resist when captain wayne sets his phaser on charm.  resistence is futile.   so, uh, shouldn't we be moving on to the picturetaking portion of the evening.  pictures.  ii'll take it.  um, uh, the photographer must be in the bathroom.  um, wayne, can i borrow your phone.  all right, now.   work itwork iwork what.  what are you talking abcody shouldn't be taking pictures of me that are gonna be in a magazine.  .  bang.  date. what's going on here.  um, uh, nothing.  you know, uh, just your typical  interview. date.  am i on a date with london tipton or not.  cody, am i being interviewed by the editor ofheiressmagazine.  pfft. i'm not the editor ofheiressmagazine.  i work at the paul revere minimart.  i'm having dinner with some greasy bag boy.  hey. i'm the greasy assistant manager.  eww. eww, eww, eww, eww.  eww. pfft, pfft. eww, eww, eww.  i think she likes you.  so, wayne, when do i start.  never.  is that a firm never.  i don't know how it happened, but somehow you all passed this test.  yeah. yeah.  i'd accuse you of cheating, but i don't wanna do the paperwork.  bird, with all due repect, i don't think you're giving these kids enough credit.  they can rise to a challenge.  you're the best, zack.  you rock.  i love you.  zack, you make a good point.  starting today, i'm gonna make this class a whole lot harder.  you're the worst, zack. you stink.  i love you.  the heart wants what the heart wants.  you know, this is becoming strangely relaxing.  cody: hey, wayne. you wanted to see me.  right.  welcometo the paul revere family.  really.  you're not mad about the other night.  it takes more than that to derail the wayne train.   whoo ooh.  but the date was bogus.  the pictures you took weren't.  i posted 'em on my blog.  suddenly a lot of ladieswanna take a spin on the tiltawayne.  so what's my first job,boss.  unpack that box of bananasfrom south america.  what's this for.
