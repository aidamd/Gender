captioning institute, inc.  by the pricking of my thumbs something wicked this way comes.  ooh. unh. aah.  sorry. every crook for himself.  ohh. unh.  help. let me out.  hey, spidey. back in black, huh.  i approve.  what. hey. hey.  unh.   . swingin' fromthe highest ledge .  . he can leapabove our heads .  . ah ah ah ah ah .  . spectacular, spectacular .  . spiderman .  . spectacular,

uh, actually,he's getting bigger.  not thatthat helps, either.  i gotcha, johnny.  no, pop.stay back.  no wonder this lab goes through funding so quickly.   it's ok. attack's over.  and, hey, i taught that wall a thing or two.  are you joking about this.  too soon, huh.   this should help.  why don't you try it on in my office.  er, carefully.  what's happening to my son.  he was exposed to the alien life form on the hull of his space shuttle.  colonel jameson was infected by the symthethe life form.  actually, he's infected with microscopic spores that hitched a ride on the life form, the way gum sticks to a shoe.  we've been tracking his condition for months.  since entering the colonel's system, the spores have multiplied exponentially.  connors thinks they may have originated on a highmass, highgravity world, likelike jupiter.  i don't care if they're from jersey.  2 secondsit's just not that simple.  my gene cleanser had no effect.  neither did extreme heat or cold.  i've had limited success destroying individual spores with electricity, but, in the meantime, i get to wear the fancy suit.  i hear it's all the rage on jupiter.  you look like a fool superhero.  the spores are chemically altering your mass, making you heavier, stronger.  this, uh, jupiter suit will slow you down, regulate your heartbeat and help you function in earth normal gravity.  plus, the ladies love a man in uniform.  it's good to maintain your sense of humor.  any personality changes might imply the spores are chemically altering your mind as well.  flash: hey, sha shan.  you didn't come to my party.  y would i.  ..  ohh.  you didn't understand.  see, i invited you as my date.  tdon't you know who i am.  only the best quarterback ncubed has ever seen.  the reason the mustangs won state.  the hero who threw the winning pass at cost of life and limb.  ohh.  i know who you are, flash.  we're in bio together.  look, i've never seen you throw a pass, but i've seen you set off the sprinklers in the lab.  twice.  fine. walk away.  you think you're all that.  i can date any girl i want in this crummy school.  reputation, reputation, reputation.  oh, i have lost my reputation.  i have lost the immortal part of myself, and what remains is bestial.  i have to get to the paper, but i'll drop you at home first.  you mind if i tag along.  i got a paycheck waiting atthe bugle.  sure, kid. get in.  we can split the fare.  sorry.  guess that's the sound of me kissing a normal life goodbye.   been there. kiss that.  well, maybe shutting a door on normal can open a window onwhat are you babbling about, parker.  he's infected.  it's not contagious. eyes front.  i'm just saying, he's been given great power.  maybe great responsib what.  what.  what.  spiderman's back in black and on a crime spree.  . i want everyone on it.  victim stories, eyewitness accounts, oh. and the headline.
