cream truck bell.  next thing i knew, i was almost flattened.  first of all, i was the one who sneezed just to freak you out.  thanks.  it worked.  wait a minute.  i'm having a vision.  it's someone taking your five bucks you left on the dresser.  who.  me.  sorry. ahem.  you two are very cute together.  here.  cheaper than a ring.  arwin, arwin.  why are you hauling junk through my lobby.  ..

this label and put it on raven's dress.  why doesn't she like miss raven's dress.  it's beautiful.  because i like it, and london is being a fashion snob.  are you sure miss london is not here.  ..  well, she could be back any minute.  shopping in paris. we're fine.  london: sorry i have to cancel our shopping trip, porsha.  paris must be a lot closer than i thought.  hide. ok.  oh.  ohh. ohh.

have a satellite.  uhhuh.  ok.  well, maybe we'll go to paris next weekend.  follow me.  i think we can make it out through bikini boulevard.  cody. whoa.  right here.  cody, why are you curled up in a ball behind the couch.  well, raven had this feeling that something horrible was going to happen to me.  it involved a sneeze and a bell.  you know, i had a boyfriend once who was very superstitious.  oh, here we go.  he had this lucky belt that he wore everyday.  never left the house without it.  and one day, he forgot it, and you know what happened.  his pants fell down.  actually, he got hit by a bus.  but he lived.  thanks.  that was really comforting, mom.  i think i'll go cover myself in bubble wrap and hide behind the couch again.  honey, honey, honey, honey.  you can find fear in anything if you look hard enough.  life is full of risks, but you can't spend your whole life hiding.  easy for you to say.  most of your life is over.  and on that note, i am going to go get dressed for work on my birthday.  hey, cody. where are you.  you've got to check out thiswhoa.  right here.  this is getting ridiculous.  look, mom's surprise party is in 20 minutes.  you are going to be there.  no.  i am not going to let you ruin mom's birthday.  raven said some kid in a sweater vest is going to get hurt.  so, i'll wear your sweater vest, and you can wear my favorite school shirt.  i'd rather take my chances.  then pick one of my other shirts and i'll wear this.  i'm not scared.  oh, no.  what.  i look like a dork.  ha ha ha ha.  hey, buddy.  could i borrow your finger for a second.  here.  you ok there, shaky shakerton.  arwin, do you believe people can sense things that happen in the future.  no. it's a bunch of bologna.  i went to a palm reader once.  she said i'd lose all my hair, spend my life as a failed inventor forever trying to impress a woman who would never love me.  what a goof.  yeah. way off.  would you relax.  how n i relax when a bell can go off at any minute.  i hear footsteps.  hide.  all: surprise.   this is the best hotel ever.   oh, you all trippin'.  i wasn't supposed to be here anyway.  hey, maddie.  what's going on. did london

do you have something to do with this.  ok. i'm sorry.  it's just that london wouldn't wear anything unless it was a big name designer, so i sort of switched labels.  and you thought that would work.  well, i gave it a shot.  i knew how much this meant to you.  wait a minute.  i'm wearing something made by someone who's not famous.  i've never done that before.  even my diapers were designer.
