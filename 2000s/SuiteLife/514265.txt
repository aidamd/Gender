so gonna win this thing.  no, i'm not.  you need to have confidence.  you're such a loser.  what's wrong with you.  i'm throwing the competition.  rebecca needs the prize money for vet school.  we've gone through too much for you to ruin this now.  we. i'm the one wearing a dress.  and you've never looked better.  well, you better take a good last look 'cause i'm about to take it off for good.  i can't believe your gonna let some girl come between us.  you are not throwing this competition.  try and stop me, pal.  well, then take off the dress 'cause i can't hit a woman.   cody: zack, let me

tyriffic.   ugh. where's zack.  who.  tyreesha.  she's out there.  you're ruining rebecca's chance at the crown.  you're ruining our chance for new bikes.  uh. unh.  i don't care about the bikes.  i care about rebecca.  well, i don't.  that's because you only think of yourself.   what is going on.  nothing out of the ordinary.  your boys are attempting to destroy my hotel, but with a new twist.  one of them's wearing a dress.  what in the day long dickens is going on.  i don't know which one of you is tyreesha, but she or he is disqualified.  you're a boy.  you're a boy.  very funny.  you guys are such jerks.  zack, why are you wearing a skirt.  i did it so we could win money for bikes.  oh, thank goodness.  hey, man. you ok.  yeah.  sorry i ruined it for you and rebecca.  i guess i was just being a selfish, greedy goofball.  nah, you weren't greedy.  so we're cool.  we're cool.  i can't believe i thought a girl could be more useful than a bike.  it's ok, buddy. we all make mistakes.  well, i'm never making that mistake again.  from now on, it's just you and me.  cody, can i talk to you.  buzz off, bike boy.  hi, rebecca. nice tiara.  i'm glad you won.  thanks to you.  i heard you tried to throw the competition for me.  i shouldn't have called you a jerk.  it's ok.  well, i guess this is goodbye.  yeah. bye.  i hate to say goodbye 'cause, you know, it's like we just met and now it's like you're gonna be leaving and it's likeit's ok.  so much better than a bike.  maryann, i'm just letting you know i am not paying for this movie 'cause i didn't like it.  i'll waive the fee, madam.  i understand what it's like to have to look at something utterly repulsive.  thank you.  uhhuh.  captioning made possible byabc cable networks group captioning performed bythe
