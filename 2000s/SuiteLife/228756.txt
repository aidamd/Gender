'cause we're living the suite life .  . oh ay oh .  . this boat's rocking .  . oh ay oh .  . rocking the whole world round .  . and we're living the suite life now .  oh ay oh .  .  oh no.  look at this mess.  .   in here.   i hate my job.  oh.  oh hi, mr. moseby.  i can come back when you're done playing.  oh. i'm not playing.  a little help here.  okeydokey.    sorry, sir.  i forgot you're a grown man who weighs as much as a baby.  can i help you up.  no thanks. i'm good.  frankie, why aren't you finishing construction on the aqua lounge.  tipton isdemanding that we open friday.  really.  because i didn't know that from the hundreds of texts, the countdown calendar and the hourly visits.  oh, by the way, i did not appreciate the one when i was in the shower.  it wasn't the highlight of my day either.  just get itdone.  i have enough trouble trying to find a new sushi chef.  moseby, this could be a lucky day for the both of us.  it just so happens i am quite the whiz with wasabi.  yeah.  i'd like to offer my services as your new sushi chef.  this is a worldclass ship.  i only hire professionals.     zack:oh darn.    coffin.  dirt. bailey.  i like where this is going.  it's not a coffin.  it's a planter.  working back on the farm made me realize how much i miss helping things grow with just a spoonful of seeds and a skyful of sunshine.  you're not gonna start singing, are you.  guess not.  i thought i'd start a garden here in our room.  you know, i hate " come on, london.  this'll be great.  thanks to my new superduper fertilizer, before you know it, we'll have bushels of yummy cornsnips.  eww. what are those.  oh, it's a hybrid vegetable combining the sweet taste of corn with the hearty fiber of parsnips.  ugh. ooh ooh.  i have an idea.  quicktell me before it dies of loneliness.  well, we could plant something that people want, like carats.  that's the spirit.  here, plant this.  it's only five carats and i want it to grow bigger.  one carat for each i.q. point.  and done.   you know what i love more than funnel cake.  nothing.  zack, i finished my hip hopera.  i'm gonna send it to some hotshot broadway producers.  but before i do, tell me what you think.  all right.  dot, dot, circle, circle with a stick, dot with a stick and a feather.  this doesn't make any sense.  those are notes.  i've got a note for youboring.  don't you know people in show business have no imagination.  you've gotta show 'em thegoods.  you know, that's not a bad idea.  maybe i can make a little demo video and send it to 'em.  you can be my cameraman.  why would i do that.  well, i'll give you 20% of the first dollar gross plus a piece of the merchandising.  uh, i don't know.  how about a funnel cake.  done.  wow, the aqua lounge looks awesome.  moseby says we're not supposed to be in here until it's officially open.  i know.  but i need to practice my sushi skills on the special sushi surface.  sheesh.  shush.   frankie:well, relax, mr. moseby.  we're still on schedule.  no no no.  this is all wrong.  what.  this is built exactly to your specifications.  i even lowered the height of the stools so your feet wouldn't dangle.  and i appreciate that.  what i meant was there is a streak on poseidon's peephole.  excuse me.  well, i thought it was better than barnacle bill's blowhole.  yeah.   shark.  that's a dolphin.   either way, i need to go change my pants.     thank goodness he's gone.  i couldn't hold my breath any longer.  why were you holding your breath.  we just had to be quiet.  now you tell me.  whoa.  relax. it's a sujihiki.  a whojiwhatey.  no, a hujiwati is for cutting fruits and vegetables.  the sujihiki is for the delicate job of filleting fish and should only be used by trained professionals.  oh whatever.  hurry up. i'm hungry.  patience, woodysan.  i will now prepare a dish i like to call the cody roll of delight and wonder.   the secret ingredient is the most rare of all japanese delicaciesthe gero squid.  ooh, that sounds tasty.  what does "gero" mean.  vomit.  what, was the market out of booger slugs.  it's called the vomit squid because if prepared improperly it can make you sick.  ..   knows how to use the small part of the squid that is both safe and delicious.  woody, did you just eat what was on the plate.  no.  woody, that was the part i was gonna throw away.  you ate the poison sac.  i think maybe i should go to the doctor.  i don't think the poison sac agrees with me.  it doesn't agree with anyone, ergo "the poison sac".  ooh.  wow.  yeah, it's my costume for the opening number " great, huh.  okay.  and action.  . the kids in the playground turned their backs .  . just 'cause we're all out of whack .  . it's our fault camisha sits alone .  . no texts coming on in this girl's phone .  . we're pointing east, west, north, south .  . so camisha's got .. .  all this and funnel cake too.  oh no.  i see a crack.  sorry. my bad.  uhoh.    i'm probably gonna have to fix that.  okay, guys, check it out.  i've vamped it up a little bit.   . now we're straight thanks to these braces .  . but all the kids, .  . except one boy who gives a grin .  . well, he can see past .  . all this tin .  . we were pointing east, west, north and south .  . camisha's got .  .. cut.  thanks, girls.  thank you.  so what do you guys think.  are all the songs about teeth.  i like the girls, but i think i'd have you extracted.   my thoughts exactly.  i'm not talking about his show.  i'm talking about my stomach.  cody tried to poison me.  oh, yup. yup.  i left food on a plate and warned you not to eat it.  officer, take me away.  you kids.  my underwater lounge is now completely underwater.  so that's good, right.  no, it's not good.  it'sruined.  i have put up with a lot from you hooligans, but this time you have crossed the line.  tipton isfurious and so am i.  whoever has done this, whoever is responsible will be expelled immediately and kicked off of this ship.   hey, everyone.  with all the infoon all things disney 365 days a year, there's 104 daysof summer vacation, and i'm mikey, with phineasand ferb, of course, as they take overthe allnew disney story, the phineas and ferbheadquarters.  all: let's get started.  ..  i know what we're gonna do today.  all right, guys, agent p starts just like this.  phineas and ferb creators dan povenmire and jeff "swampy" marsh are here to do all sorts of things.  they're teaching kids how to draw the characters.  how'd you do. that's pretty darn good.  these are all really good phineas and ferbs.  plus, there's asquirrels in my pantsdance contest.  . step right over and watch me put it down .  squirrels. all: squirrels.  . step right over and watch me put it .  . "s" to the "i" to the "m" to the "p" .   and the kids are doing impressions too.  completely unexpected, i mean completely unexpected.  curse you, perry the platypus.  phineas and ferb are making a title sequence.  oh, very good.  so what would phineas and ferb say about today's event.  well, i think phineaswould say it was awesome.  yeah.ferb.  ferbferb wouldn't havesaid much.  's it like here at the allnew disney store.  there's a whole theater over there.  they got all the projections on the trees.  and we love having the phineas and ferb stuff here.  speaking of phineas and ferb, what's it like to have them here in the store.  just the culmination of our dreams sort ofsort of to see them in real life.  how's it feel to have your show have so many fans.  the best thing we ever hear is people say, "i watch it, and my 14yearold and my 8yearold and my 5yearold all watch "  morning, agent p.  doofenshmirtz is up to no good again.  agent p,doofenshmirtz has crippled the entireworldwide internet.   it's on the sign.  doofenshmirtz evil incorporated.  so here's my evil plan.  well, i hope your summer never ends.  i'm mikey. i'm dan.  ..  all:disney 365. see ya.  i haven't seen moseby that angry since i was five and told him i wished he'd disappear.  well, all kids get mad at grownups and say things they don't mean.  yeah, but i actually hired some guys to do it.  he didn't find his way back to the hotel for a whole month.  i can't believe moseby is gonna kick someone off the ship.  this is horrible.  it wouldn't be the same if one of us left.  yeah, i've never had friends like you guys.  well, actually i've never really had friends.  even as a kid, all i had was imaginary acquaintances.  who could've done something so incredibly stupid and de i'm pretty sure they're talking about you.  well, we're gonna miss you, zack.  hey hey hey hey.  why do you all assumeidid this.  i haven't pulled a prank since i put the liquid soap in the ship's horn.  when did you do that.    this morning.  wow. huh.  mommy is proud of you.   uhoh.  auntie london is not gonna be happy when she sees you.  oh, she sees it and she is not happy, but she doesn't care, because she'll bewho am i talking about again.  you.  well, i'll be leaving the ship once i confess to flooding the aqua lounge.  it wasyou.  heck no.  i just want to get off this floating jail.  but, london, this isserious.  one of our friends is gonna get kicked off of the boat.  what are you doing.  i always harvest when i'm upset.  these roots are strong.    and long.  oh no, this is bad.  my superduper fertilizer must've made the roots grow right through the planter and the floorboards.  what if they expanded right through the hull of the ship, compromising its integrity and eventually cracked the window in the aqua lounge.  uhoh.    it's my fault.  i broke the aqua lounge.  i'm gonna get expelled and kicked off the ship.   you know, woody, this whole aqua lounge disaster might be my fault.  what do you mean.  well, after you left the lounge to barf, i kept practicing my sushi skills.   oh. my sujihiki.  maybe the knife hit the window and caused a hairline fracture that i didn't see.  uhoh.    proving once again no good can come from your sujihiki.  i can't let zack get expelled for something i did.  well, on the other hand, i love everything about school while zack just thinks of it as a place to sleep between naps.  ..   actually, now that i think about it, it might be my fault.  see, right after i ran out of the aqua lounge, i made a beeline for the bathroom.  getgetgetgetoh.   oh. ladies room.  woody: that sushi did not agree with me.    the buildup of gas in the plumbing must've been too much for them to bear and the vibrations caused the window to break.  uhoh.    woody, i really don't think that could happen.  oh yeah.  one thanksgiving, i blew my grandmother's septic tank clear out of the ground.  it was shot down over canada.  confess.  never.  i know you did it.  i didn't.  ooh, that's what you would say if you were guilty.  and what would i say if i weren't guilty.  you're always guilty.  mmm, yeah, that seems fair.  moseby.  mmm.  i want you to know that the aqua lounge was all my fault.  aha.  your fault. how so.  i don't know.  just call daddy and have him throw me off the ship.  oh.  he won't be surprised.  i've been thrown out of lots of stuffpreschool, middle school, high school dance club, glee club, switzerland.  moseby, i need to tell you that what happened to the aqua lounge was all my fault.  aha again.  my cornsnips grew into the bulkheads.  excuse me.  moseby, the aqua lounge was all my fault.  i'm out of ahas.  my sujihiki hit the window.  excuse me.  mr. moseby.  the aqua lounge was all my fault.  my powerful bowels have struck again.  excuse me.  no, excuse me.  i see what's going on here.  you're all covering for zack.  now your loyalty is admirable, however, tipton is demanding that someone be punished.  well, you're not punishing zack, because he's innocent.  oh no.  i know, i know.  the aqua lounge was all your fault.  heck no, but it wasn't zack's either.  he couldn't have done it.  he's been with me nonstop filming my hip hopera.  and this timecode here proves it.  oh, thank you, buddy.  oh, so i guess it's no one's fault that my aqua lounge is underwater up to here.  what's that, like a foot and a half of water. big deal.  moseby, i think i got to the bottom of things.  and.  it seems something clogged an air duct 'causing an internal rupture which cracked the window.  oh.  was it my cornsnips.  was it my sujihiki.  was it my powerful bowels.  nope. nope. eww.  it was this pocket hanky.  apparently you dropped your hanky into the vent when you got scared by that dolphin and wet your pants.   oops.   ah. it's mr. tipton.  he's going to want to know who to throw off the ship.   i don't want to leave.  tipton fire mr. moseby.  oh, give me the phone.   daddy, i flooded the aqua lounge.  it was all my fault.  yup, it's switzerland all over again.  mmhmm. mmhmm.  okay. bye, daddy.  well, did he kick you off.  nah, he just cut my allowance by 50,000 a week.  looks like no one's leaving the ship after all.   yes. i'm leaving the ship.  all: what.  but it's moseby's fault.  oh no, i know, but i just got an email from those producers about my hip hopera.  they said it was the most ridiculous thing they've ever seen.  then why are you so happy.  they said it's gonna be the next big comedy.  they're moving my whole family to new york.  i'm gonna star in a broadway show.  i'm gonna be the lead tooth.  i thought you said it was a serious love story about overcoming adversity.  look, it's a stupid song about a girl with bad teeth.   all: . retainer baby, retainer baby .  . i require the wire .  .. .   well, i guess it's cake time.  well, mr. moseby.  thanks again for everything.  before i left, i wanted to give you a little something.  please, marcus, you don't need to do that.  your friendship is gift enough.  well, it's a lil little tshirt made into a pocket hanky.  this is the best gift ever.  oh, this reminds me of my goodbye party when i left kettlecorn except you're leaving and i'm not.  and we're in a boat and not in a barn.  and there's not a giant twister bearing down on us.  oh, marcus, congratulations.  thank you.  well, woody, i'm gonna miss you.  marcus, i always thought of you as a brothera real brother, not like steve's kid neil, who's 40 years old and lives in my tree house.  well, i've got nothing to say to that, so let's just cut right to the man hug.  i'm going to miss you, marcus.  i just wanted to say good luck, big guy.  to think you'll be entertaining people whilepromoting proper dental care.  oh, i am so proud of you.  i'm gonna miss you, cody.  i'm gonna miss you too.  zack, i think i'm gonna miss you most of all.  hurtful.  i'm gonna miss you too, buddy.  you know what.  you were the only roommate i've ever had that i didn'thate.  hurtful.  well listen, guys.  i just wanna say thank you for everything.  before i came here i was going through a really really tough time but you guys, you took me in and made me feel like family. )
