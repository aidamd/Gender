tell me the explanation is that you're a girl, becausestrangely attracted to you right now.  all right, all right, i'm a girl.  see, all the girl spots for this year were filled, so i applied as a guy.  and since my name is bailey, and i did play on the boy's baseball team, it worked.  well, it worked right up until the moment when you walked out when you were scheduled to be taking a shower and ruined the whole thing.  so somehow this ismyfault.  don't you knock when you leave a bathroom.  lucky i was raised by a woman, so this sort of irrational behavior doesn't throw me.  now, wouldn't it have been easier andjust thinking aloud out hereto wait and apply next year.  no.  and if you'd ever swilled hogs, you'd know why.  not that i don't love kettlecorn, but it's just too little.  if you blink, you miss the whole town and suddenly you're caught up in the hustle and bustle of kettlepot.  ooh.  i just can't go home now.  you have to promise not to tell anyone i'm a girl.  please, i'm begging you.  don't worry.  it'll be our little secret.  woody said he's willing to tradewhy are you guys holding hands.  uh, secret handshake.  yes.  oh, by the way, i amnottrading roommates.  so why didn't you want to switch roommates.  ..  we figured opposites attract.  and by opposites, he means, ..  not like boy and girl.  uh, why don't we go play some pool and let cody and woody work out their issues, huh.  we have issues.  no no no.  yes.  here, let me show you how to do it.  thanks, zack.  why can't we get along like that.  what are you doing.  uh, how about them patriots.  yeah.  i hate this stupid sea school and i hate this stupid boat.  hey, galaxy raider game is open.  i love this stupid boat.  dibs on the gold headphones.  they match my outfit.   woman over p.a.:attention.  we will now conduct our first lifeboat drill.  report to your assigned muster station.   boy, that's a loud bell.  i can barely hear myself not think.  what does three consecutive alarm bells mean.  uh, i don't know.  let me check.  one bell, breakfast.  two bells, lunch.  three bells, sinking ship.  sinking ship.   which way.  uh, port.  cody: london, your other port.  the boat is already tipping over.  no, you just broke your heel.  worse.  look, life jackets.  uck. are they all orange.  i need to go change.  ..  look, an exit.  let's get out of here.  one at a time.  one at a time.  all: right.    we fell overboard.  why is the ocean so hot.  probably because it's a hot tub.  why is there a hot tub in the middle of the ocean.  here's your hat, bailey.  dude, you're a girl.   oh.  iam.  that explains so much.  miss picket, why on earth would you masquerade as a boy.  well, ii don't know.  yes, you do.  it was her only way to get out of popcorn, kansas.  kettlecorn.  whatever.  this girl was meant for bigger things than to shuck hogs.  no, you shuck corn.  if you try to shuck a hog, it bites you.  work with me.  okay.  anyways, seven seas high was bailey's one chance to get off the farm which she's dreamed of doing her whole life.  you can't send her back to carmelcorn.  if you've ever been to kettlepot, you've driven right through it.  well, bailey, your application was by far the most impressivewait a minute. what.  what about my essay on barnacle reproduction.  i had pictures.  can i see them.  bailey, i'd let you stay, but unfortunately, we don't have a cabin to put you in.  she can stay in my room.  i'm willing to take one for theteam.  i meant agirl'scabin.  every girl has a roommate.  except for me.  london, thank you, thank you.  huh.  london, so nice of you to offer to share your room with bailey.  i wasn't offering, i wasgloating.  here's a diamond necklace.  drop out.  i wouldn't drop out of this school for all the money in the world.  i can get
