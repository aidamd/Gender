"dear shirley, "i really like this guy, "but he comes on like a player "and he can kind of be obnoxious.  "but he is really funny and awfully cute.  " just ask me out, honey, and hope i say yes.  how do you know she's talking aboutoh, yeah. she said obnoxious.  i think i'll give darlene a little advice on how to take a crack at the zack.  what are you doing.  just watch.  sometimes a player isn't really obnoxious.  he's just hiding the fact that he's shy and sensitive underneath.  you can't do that.  why not.  because it would be using your position on the paper to manipulate someone for your own personal gain.  it's morally repugnant.  come again.  bad. wrong.  a nono.  oh.  that morally repugnant.  don't you realize you would be compromising your journalistic ethics.  you see, that's where you're wrong.  i have no ethics.  cody, we have great news.  really great news.  terrific, actually.  would you get to the point.  ms. cohen's looking for you.  she loves the paper.  she really, really loves it.  really.  she says you're the best editor we've ever had.  really.  and her favorite column is ask shirley.  really.  everyone loves the ask shirley column.  even the football players are having it read to them.  good work, team. all right.   well, from what i read, shirley does seem like kind of woman.  think you could hook me up.  i don't think you and shirley are going to work out.  oh, you just wanna save her for yourself.  trust me. i don't.  so, isn't it great how much people love my column.  although it kind of creeps me out that bob wants to date me.  you could do worse, and you have.  actually, i'm hoping to do better.  a lot better.  you really think your advice to darlene is going to work.  " just taking a chance here, but would you like to go out for a milkshake.  gee, darlene, this is such a surprise.  i mean, i always thought you thought i was ..  obnoxious.  i did, but then i found out that some guys who are players might really be shy and sensitive underneath.  ..  that's me.  what's wrong with your brother.  he forgot his combination.  oh.  try this candy.  it's hard on the outside, yet soft and mushy on the inside.  kind of like me.  ..  i'm really having fun.  oh, me, too.  and the best part is i feel like i can open up to you.  just think of me as dr. phil with hair.  well, i've only had one boyfriend before, and it didn't turn out so well.  what happened. tell dr. zack.  he told me he had to study, but i caught him kissing my best friend at the movies.  what a jerk.  it took me forever to get over that.  like, almost a month.  well, you can trust me.  i know.  thanks.  no kissing in the lobby.  no. i'll get those things.  no, it's fine.  zack, why is your backpack full of ask shirley letters.  all right.  you caught me.  i cannot tell a lie.  i deliver the letters to shirley.  she lives in maine, someone stole her bike, she broke her leg, and she's afraid of the bus.  ok, i'm shirley.  that means you read my letter, which means you're the one who gave me the advice to ask you out.  yeah.  and see how great it worked out.  i mean, here we are, almost kissing in the lobby.  ha ha ha. no.  here we are almost kicking in the lobby.  oh. ow.  what was that for.  that letter was written in confidence to shirley.  now that i know it's you, it changes everything.  you lied to me to make me like you.  i never want to see you again.  mom, come see the new edition.  i changed the font.  i went with helvetica.  i'm proud of you, honey.  i don't like to admit it, but i owe a lot to zack's ask shirley column.  it's taken him 13 years, but he finally pulled through for me.  i'm quitting the paper.  what. why.  darlene found out i was shirley, and now she hates me.  so. use the paper to find another girl.  ..  .  no. i really hurt darlene's feelings.  i don't deserve to be giving advice to anyone.  find yourself another shirley.  i can't.  no one's as obnoxious and insensitive as you are.  don't sweet talk me.  i'm not going to change my mind.  oh, yes, you are.  you have a responsibility to your readers.  they want shirley. they need shirley.  they trust shirley.  you know what. you're right.  shirley does have something to say.  that's my girl.
