nice plate of food.  although i could've done without the fish head.  oh, you think the fish head is bad, wait till you hear your punishment.  so you mean we're grounded.  grounded.  you mean, like in the suite with tv, video games and room service.  that's not punishment. that's camp.  we never liked camp.  nice try. you're not leaving my sight.  in fact, you're spending saturday with me picking our wardrobe for my act.  you mean, where you try on clothes.  and lots and lots of shoes.  nooo. nooo.  hey, guys, what do you think.  the teal or the aqua.  the one you're wearing. the teal.  this is aqua.  this is torture.  this is my favorite punishment ever.   i'm tired of setting tables.  next time we case a place, i want a better job.  like what. well, i always wanted to sing.  i've heard you sing.  you're a better jewel thief.  did you hear that.  yeah. the jewel thief wants mom's job.  no. it means we're back in business.  what are you guys doing back here.  see those guys.  what guys.  they're the jewel thieves.  eddie, check it out.  tada.  yeah, they look like a couple of real masterminds.  no. we overheard them.  but we weren't eavesdropping.  enough, you blew it with the diamonds and the rubys.  i'm not listening to your wild stories anymore.  butsit. it's shoe time.  man, i hope i never see another show again in my life.  there are the crooks.  what are we gonna do.  tell esteban.  esteban.  we know who the real thieves are.  again.  and we're here to clear your incredibly long name.  i'm sorry, but i can trust you no longer.  i must turn my back on you.  but mostly because i'm going this way.  why don't grownups ever listen to us.  because they think we're just kids.  well, there's only one thing to do.  prove we're right, clear our name and get esteban off the hook.  that's 3 things.  just play along.  hey, guys.  i seem to have lost my wallet.  have you seen it anywhere.  nope.  now we have to borrow money from london tipton, our good friend who is quite wealthy.  ah, yes.  the one that lives in suite 2500.  but sadly, she is out of town.  so suite 2500 is empty, you say.  with a bunch of cash and jewels and furs and other pricey items in a big, empty suite that is empty.  yep, except for the dogsitter who is gone every night from 7:00 to 7:30.  well, thanks for your help.  no, no, no. thank you.  yeah, thank you. ha ha ha.   ahem.   i think we have laid quite a trap.  will you stop talking like that.  i don't think i can.  you know, pink is your color.  it really highlights your tail.  ok.  ooh.  is this your boyfriend.  you go, girl.  but you know, looks aren't everything.  i went out with this guy once who was gorgeous.  but he was so stupid, he should've been walking on all fours.  no offense.  you know, i really like talking to you.  and clearly i need a life.   ivana's line.  it's me. put her on.  oh. ivana, it's mommy.   what's going on.  ivana, get on the phone.  you'll hurt mommy's feelings.  why won't my baby talk to me.  what have you done to her.  nothing. she loves me.  i mean, not as much as she loves you.  isn't that right, ivana.  rarf rarf rarf rarf arf.  see.  that's not ivana's bark.  does she have a sore throat.  she just misses you and we're about to miss our movie night.  toodles.  daddy.  clearly you're breaking her heart.  but i'm liking you better.  look, mommy wanted to bring you but couldn't.  so the best revenge is spend her money.  ha ha ha.  i'll get us a cab.  great idea.  we don't have much time before the crooks arrive.  do you have the pass key.  " of course, i've got the pass key.  let's set up the camera.  you set up the camera if you want to.  i'm gonna set up the net to actually catch them.  like that'll work.  these are crooks, not wild boar.  the idea is to capture them, not make a little movie called look who got away.  i'm putting the fake jewelry right here in view of the camera.  yeah, whatever.  .  i'm camouflaging the net with leaves so the crooks don't see it.  what would leaves be doing in a hotel room.  i'll open the window so it looks like they blew in from the park across the street.  like anyone will buy that.  luckily it won't matter because we'll catch them on tape.  now give me the tape.  i can't use this.  this is my first pony ride.  i'll get the tape of mom potty training us.  ok. i'm with you on that one.  they're here.  quick. put the tape in.  i'm sorry about the movie.  i didn't know it was a cat flick.  hey, you want to do each other's hair.  what are all these leaves doing here.  you're going to step on the trap i set for the jewel thieves.  have you two totally lost it.  you're the one talking to a dog.  and she agrees with me. you've lost it.  we heard the thieves talking about the jewels.   it's them.  quick, hide.   all: stop. aah.  congratulations.  you caught london's laundry.  no, i swear, the jewel thieves are coming.  oh, no. not again.  listen, little blond peoples, i'm in enough troubles.  i don't need anymore of your help.  it's them.  help.  oh.   oh, jewels.  all: no.  aah.  hey, it worked.  big deal. you caught muriel.  i could've done that with a slice of pie and whipped cream.  ooh, sounds great. could you heat it up.  we'll get you right down.  hurry up. this thing is giving me a wedgie.  i'll get her down.  hey, watch it.  i'm not a piata.   it's got to be them this time.  there's no one else left in the hotel.  but my trap's already been sprung.  what do we do.  here's an idea. hide.  muriel, don't move.  muriel: oh, yeah.  i was just on my way to the riviera.  what's with all these leaves.  must've blown in the window from the park across the street.  told ya.  check it out.  look at all those jewels.  that'll buy us a month in hawaii.  or if we budget our money carefully, 4 weeks.  we got it all on tape.  you were right. sorry.  oh, a camera.  this'll be great for our trip to hawaii.  i take my sorry back.  what was that.  who's behind the sofa.  maddie: mice.  oh, ok.  come out of there.  well, you're caught.  put your hands up.  step back, little blond peoples.  i'm here to clear the name of esteban julio ricardo montoya del rosa ramirez.  son of diego esteban julio ricardo montoya del rosa ramirez.  muriel: bad dog.  nooooo.  and his wife gladys.  hey, hot shot, when you get out of the slammer, call me, huh.  all: aaaaah.  esteban, i hope you know i never suspected you.  thank you, sir.  i never suspected you, either.  and thank you, my little friends.  i never should have doubted you.  it's all right, buddy.  we all make mistakes.  what were you guys thinking, putting yourselves in danger.  well, you wouldn't believe us.  you're right.  if you hadn't let your imaginations run away with you in the first place, we would've believed you when it really mattered.  it's like the boy who cried wolf.  who said anything about a wolf.  aren't you happy we caught them.  not the point.  you know there's a $10,000 reward.  my boys.  well, excuse me, but i'm the one that fell on those dirt bags.  yeah, but i'm the one that set the trap.  see.  but ivana's the one who cut the rope.  well, i guess whoever owns this dog is going to be very, very rich.  don't be mad, snookums.  mommy's home.  life isn't fair.  aah.  ..  so, ivana, tell london how you felt about being left behind.  that is so hurtful.  i do so love you.  please.  it's ivana's turn to vent.  i promise i'll never leave you again.   and.   i'll spend more quality time with you.    my work here is done.  and your time is up.  that'll be $10,000.
