and demons dorkdom.  who cares that none of those stuck up girls would go .   this is way cooler.   who am i kidding.  i'm going to spend the rest of my life stuck in a basement with you losers.  .  i

new planwe're gonna split the sky deck right down the middle.  then the kids can decide if they want to come as creepy medieval nerds, or pathetic '80s geeks.  adults: hurtful.  okay, sounds like a plan.  i'll make sure to call you when i'm the last man on the planet.  your loss, weinblattcommasuzy.  next up, yankoviccommacissy.   what are you doing on my shoulder.  trying to get you a date.  and get a little dog poop off my shoe.  look, if you blow it with cissy yankovic, the last girl on that list is zelda zzyzx and she's got a unibrow that wraps around her head like a sweatband.  you make a good point.  ..  be me.  be the bad boy.  don't ask cissy out, tell her you're going out.  okay, you're right.  hellooo.  no, knock on the door like you're not afraid to break a nail.  yo,

something in your eye.  just an eyeful of your lusciousness.  just an eyeful of your lusciousness.  okay, see you at 7:00.  hi, i'm bailey.  i was just sitting over there writing my paper on comparative feminist literature and wondering what is it about our patriarchal society that perpetuates the ridiculous belief that the male has to make the first move.  well, you got him to make a movein the other direction.  london, what are you doing on my shoulder.  trying to ignore the fact that i'm standing ..  and trying to help you get a date.  okay okay, what do i do.  like i told you, smarten up and act dumb, sister.  oooh, there's a cute guy.  now bat your eyes and flip your hair.  good good, he noticed you.  now look away and when you turn back, have a vacant look in your eye.  i said vacant, not zombie.  you know, bailey, i never really noticed, but when you're not busy blahblahblahing, you're kind of cute.  give him a tee hee hee.  okay, we'll need to work on that.  you wanna go to the dance tonight.  quick, flip twice for yes.  great, see you at 7:00.  oh.  yay you.  yay. i have a date.  your "dumb" lessons really worked.  see.  you should spend more time with me and less with whoever's been giving you the "ugly" lessons.   cool knight outfit.  well, technically i'm a paladin.  while a knight was any member of the warrior class in medieval europe, a paladin had a more spiritual side, combining undying faith with i think i bit my tongue.  oh, man up.  by some miracle you got a date.  now don't go messing it up with your niceynice routine.  hey, zack.  hey, can't touch this.  hey, woody.  looks like you have two personalities, as opposed to your usual zero.  do you really want to hurt me.  yes.  ooh, my knight in shining armor.  actually he's a paladin.  you can tell by the insignia from charlemagne's court.  dates: huh.  i mean tee hee hee, shiny hat.  cody, i want you to meet josh.  hey, cody.  oh wow.  that is quite a squeeze you got there.  thanks.  your date's not half bad either.  i'm gonna go put in a song request.  i'm bailey.  i'm cissy.  nice to meet you.  meow. catfight.  come on, bail.  let's go be "maniacs" on the dance floor.   cody, do you and bailey have something going on.  whoa, look out, staticsomeone's getting awful clingy.  whew whew whew.  hey, guys, let's get physical.  whew whew.  eww eww, not with you.  emma.  you look enchanting.  oh, thank you, marion.  and you look thrilling.   why, thank you.  i guess we both came to the same realization.  yeah, woody was right.  we were being childish.  i just started thinking about why this '80s dance would be so important to you.  maybe you're trying to make up for those lonely teenage years, you know, eating donuts with one hand and popping pimples with the other.  hardly.  did you call my cousin.  no, why.  oh, never mind.  and i started wondering if this renaissance dance was important to you because you spent your teenage years stuck in a basement with the neighborhood nerds playing druids and demons.  hardly.  did you call mother.  zack: look at cody, he's not caring about what his date is saying or thinking.  he is completely insensitive.  it makes me so proud.  i know.  and look at bailey, acting like she doesn't have a thought in her head.  hey, zelda.  hey.   .   and your headband is on too low.  okay, dudes and dudettes, knights and fair maidens, just a reminder, sir mixmaster woody is now taking requests.  woody, i think that emma would appreciate it if you played some gems from the '80s.  oh, that's sweet, marion, but for you, i suggest we keep it light and lutey.   no for you, i insist.  '80s pop.  no.  but you'd prefer renaissance.   and it begins anew.   so i'm thinking about trying out for the school play.  whoa, easy there, chatty cathy.  i don't remember asking for your life story.        stop it.  is it a party, people.  we're going to take a little break.  so much for the dancing.  oh good.  now why don't you go to the ladies' room, and fixthat situation, and then we'll have .  okay, that's it.  at first i thought you were cool, but you're a bigger jerk than your brother.  so what do you think of my campaign speech.  tee hee hee.  what is with you.  you can't even carry on a conversation.  it's just tee hee hee, tee hee hee.  you're even dumber than london.  hey, i heard that.  okay, let's travel through time and unite on the dance floor to this funky mashup of a true classic.   well, seems as if woody has found us a compromise.  so he has.  you care to dance, marion.  oooh, i thought you'd never ask.  yeah, i meant with me.  oh. yes yes yes.  well, at least our dates are having fun.  yep, everybody's dancing except us.  and i do mean everybody.  i hope he doesn't get his dreads caught in her unibrow.  well, we could dance.  uh, you meanyou mean with each other.  no, alone.  just next to each other.  well, i guess that would be okay.  all right, time to slow things down a bit.  so grab that special someone and pull them close.  real closemrrow.  . when i think of you .  . i leave out centuries .  . the sunshine and the lights fade to memories .  .. .  .  . and nothing's .. .  you know, marion, your outfit reminds me of the night i almost had my first kiss.  almost.  what happened.  mikey menotti caught me peeking into his rec room window " that was mikey's loss.  i must admit, i've had my share of highschool humiliations.  oh, i'll bet.  i'm sorry.  i mean go on.  .  . i used to be so proud and now my heart is opened wide .  .. .   well, we certainly have come a long way since then.  i'll thay.  i mean, i'll say.  .   i need four cherry chillers, six banana breezers, nine tangerine tickles and one kumquat kapow.  wow, you're a thirsty girl.   no, i need someone great.  bailey's going to show up to the dance with this hunky jock of a guy with shoulders right below his neck, and i'm striking out.  because you're swinging too hard.  girls can smell insecurity a mile away.  and you reek ..  baby powder.  i have prickly heat.  okay, your diaper rash aside, your bigger problem is you're too nice.  you have to act like me.  girls love the whole badboy thing i've got going on.  well, maybe that works for you, but i choose to believe girls respond to charm and sensitivity and, well, someone who's not afraid to cry.  you really are the sister i never wanted.  so i told cody i had a datea great one, with a chin and everything.  i'll
