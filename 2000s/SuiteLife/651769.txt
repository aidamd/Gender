outfit.  ..  i don't think it's going to work.  why not. he loved your outfit.  but i didn't like him.  didn't you like his outfit.  london, it's not all about outfits.  it's about the people inside them.  huh.  ..  all he can talk about is water.  swimming in water, diving in water, splashing water, salt water versus fresh water.  after talking to him for an hour, i had to go so bad.   oh, no, it's him.  dump him.  dump him like last month's shoes.  but i don't want to hurt him.  oh, so you're just going to marry him and live poolside with a bunch of boring lifeguard babies.   you're right. i got to end it.  hi, lance.  oh, i miss you, too.  oh, really.  apparently the ph balance in the pool is perfect.   london, how's the studying going.  fabulous. thanks for checking in.  ok. no.  ..

say so myself, i was pretty darn mean.  so i learned something from you and you learned something from me.  yeah.  ..  i don't have a boyfriend.  so. everybody's happy. eee.  go, go, go.  hey, guys,
