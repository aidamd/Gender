 mr. moseby.  at a baseball game.  those 2 things just don't go together.  it's like zack and homework.  or cody on a date.  oh, come on, guys.  he's really looking forward to going with you and he loves you.  he loves us.  no, but he might if he spent more time with you.  i never get a day to myself, and i changed your diapers.  oh yoknow, mom, if we knew you were always gonna pull that diaper thing, we would have just sat in it.  speak for yourself.  wow. these seats are awesome.  this i'm wearing loafers, today's finally gonna catch my first bal and while everybody rushes to stop the bleeding, i can pick it up like last time.  should we be wearing protective headgear.  moseby, when you were a kid, didn't you ever dream about catching a ball at fenway park.  no. back then, the ballet was my life.  gee, there's a surprise, huh.  i was just a kid in the chorus, but i aspired to someday beinpicked to dance the challenging yet coveted role of nutcracker prince.  so did you get to do it.  alas, no.  one nasty tetherball accident shattered my big toe.  it's just so painful for me to talk about.  try having to listen to it.  he he's you know, i read the encyclopedia of baseball last night.  all of it.  well, you have to be informed.  don't want to appear the boob.  too late.  current research proves that stealing a base, while theatrical, i'll tell you what's inadvisableshootingatistics do not lie.  sir, stealing that base would be a waste of your time.  umpire: you're out.  crowd: oh.  told you.   could you get that.  sure. come in.  oh. aah.  something's eating maddie's head.  it's my hair.  it's humid outside, which tends to make it a little frizzy.  a litt are we done making fun of my hair.  by the time we're done, your blind date's gonna think you're gorgeous.  crowd:u' o crowd: yay.  yok. go back to new york.  another reason to hate the yankees.  zack, how could you be so rude.  miss manners, this is a baseball game.  it's not your ballet class.  mock me if you will, but i was the only boy amongst 20 pretty girls.  mama didn't raise no fool.  all right. yeah.  look. it's his first time. cut him some slack.  i can razz with the best of them.  ..yankee...person.  i'm clever.  you swing like a girl. you're weak.  you'd never make it as a nutcracker.  that's telling him.  mmhmm.  announcer: and now, please rise for the seventh inning stretch.   oh.  isn't this the life.  too ba well, you can't, but i can. yay.   ow. why'd you do that.  it stimulates the circulation in your forehead, prevents wrinkles.  oh. ok.   ow.  ..ow...  aren't you guys afraid of wrinkles.  when the time comes, i'm gonna grow old gracefully.  ok, maddie, let's get started on your hair.  come olet's work and for my first trick, i made the comb disappear.  nnnh. uhh.  once we wash, condition, blow dry, straight iron and possibly shave your head.  . i'm kidding.    does my hair look ok.  i mean, no one would know it's actually a giant tumbleweed.  ok.  london.  gavin.  this is maddie. maddie, this is gavin.  hi.  hi.  you know, for 2 smart people, you guys don't say very much.  that's because we're so smart, we can communicate telepathically.  oh, yeah. oh, what's she saying.  and don't talk.  maddie just said she thinks we're going to have a great time.  and gavin just said he wishes you'd leave.  that's the rudest thing i've never heard.  sir, your table is ready.  welf it isn't little miss , but this hotel doesn't stock your favorite " patrick, no one likes coconut gum.  i do, so apparently i'm a no one.  this way.  wait. no, no, no, no.  we have to have a table inside.  .. st. patrick.  so, i see. now i'm a someone.  no, it's just that it's really humid out there.  that would explain the lack of available tabl.  we'll wait. how soon can you seat us inside.  breakfast.  splendid decision. right this way.  balmy, isn't it.  enough small talk. here's your table.  here are your menus.would you like some crayo.  well, this isn't so bad.  will you excuse me for a second.     hello.  carey, this is a disaster.  what's the matter. is your date a dud.  tell him works for me every time.  he's great, but we're outside, it's 95% humidity, and i can hear my hair frizzing.   thank goodness. sanctuary.  traitor.  how dare you show your face in here.  i'm the manager.  manager, i bet your mama t love you now.  well, she did leave a nasty message on my cell phone.  if anyone asks, we don't know you.  we just met you at the game.  and we didn't hit it off.  we were having fun. we were bonding.  i'm sorry. mom says not to talk to strangers.  oh, hi. how was the game.  oh, fine, y gr i ran as fast as i could.  not fast enough. it's growing.  no, it's ok. i got here in time.  in time for what.  in time to recommend the steak. it's fantastic.  cool. can we have some water, please.  i'm not a waitress.  who are you.  i'm a singer. she's a chef.  i'm a singing chef.  . enjoy your meal .  . try the steak, not the veal .  it really is humid tonight, isn't it.  is it. i hadn't noticed.  could you excuse me. could you excuse me.  i'll be right back.  i am not staying in any hotel managed by some benedict arnold.  i'm checking out and i'm going to stay att tel.  i'd rather die.  works for us. works for us.  poor mr. moseby.  if i hadn't made such a big deal about never catching a ball, he probably wouldn't be in this fix.  yeah.  we gotta do something.  yeah. wanna go get some ice cream.  sure.  aah.  sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. oh.  i think i've built up an immunity to it.  ok. it's a little frizzy.  how little.  somewhere between a troll doll and an unsheared sheep.   ah, miss london, may i get you a table insi but i thought you said there wasn't anything available inside.  i'm sorry. does your father own this hotel.  i didn't think so.  thank you, patrick, but i just came up to check on my friends' date.  although i don't know why i should after you thought rude things to me.  well, we apologize. now please help me blot.  you got a mop.  that's why i need your help.  see, i really like maddie, which makes me a little nervous, so it makes me sweat even more, but i don't want her to see my sweating, so i have to keep running in here to blot, which makes me sweat more.  ew, ew, ewewewewew.  take care of this.  gavin: thanks.  hey, would you mind putting some deodorant on my back.  come with me.  that's not working.  it's alive.  . i recommend the creme brulee .  . i recommend you go away .  look, you've both been hiding something.  the truth ishow do i say this nicely.  maddie's a frizzyhaired freak and gavin sweats like a donkey in a sauna.  so now you guys can just relax and enjoy your date.  i mean, if you can forget how hideous you both look.   oh, great. more smartypants silent talk.  ok, what are you guys saying.  i said that i love curly hair.  and i said that a little perspiration never hurt anybody.  oh. this is so romantic.  in an incredibly icky kind of way.  now what are you saying.  gavin wants to thank you for setting up our date and then saving it.  oh.  and maddie wants you to leave.  well, do you know what i'm thinking up here.  nothing. nothing.  wow, you guys are good.  i just hope mr. moseby's ok.  well, if you're so concerned, why don't you just ask him.  mr. moseby.  ditditditditdit.  there he is.  oh. oh, my. , no, no, no, no punching.  i can't take hitting. oh. uhh.  how does it feel to be the most hated man in boston.  i cost the so do you think you'll have to leave boston.  leave boston. he should leave the country.  yeah. yeah.  he doesn't deserve this.  hold my cone. i'm going in.  leave him alone.  who are you.  i'm the kid he took to the game.  i don't know either of them.  why'd ouldn't help doing something incredibly stupid.  it was his first game.  a grown man who's never been to a baseball game.  yeah. fat chance.  it notis fault s mom de him ar it may not have been the smartest move, but he caught that ball for me, for a kid who always dreamed of catching one.  but was too lame to do it himself because he has lousy handeye coordination.  i have astigmatism.  what it was like to go to your first baseball game,and suddenly see the stadium open up in front of you.  yeah. yeah.  smelling the newlycut grass and the fresh, roasted pe the fat fan's nacho burps.  the point is, this man didn't think he'd like baseball, but once he got there, he loved it.  so he got swept away in the excitement and caught the ball.  but to me, he's a hero.  aw.  you know, the d's t a point.  nning or losing but the love of the game.  yeah.  not if you lost your paycheck bettin you got that right.  and it knocked us out of first place.  behind the yankees.  i hate the yankees.  i hate him.  get him. yeah.  n, boys, run.  let me know if you catch him.  as i may have mentioned every 5 minutes for the last hour and a halfit's closing time.  isn't it just a gorgeous night.  absolutely perfect.  if you want to stay, i have one favor to ask.  we've run out of steel wool in the kitchen.  we'd love to scrub the pots out with your hair.  captioning made possible byabc cable networks group captioning performed
