 i thought for my audition, i'd do a song by gilbert and sullivan.  you know any songs from this century.  or the previous one.  no.  then sing.   . when i was a lad .  . i served a term as office boy to an attorney's firm .  . i cleaned the windows, and i swept the floor .  . and i polished up the handle of the big front door .  that was very interesting.  .. .  . polished that handle so carefully .  . that now i am the ruler of the queen's navy .   . yeah, we're gonna bop, bop, bop .  . bop to the top .  . wipe away your inhibitions .  . stomp, stomp, stomp to the romp .  . and strut your stuff .  thatthat's good. i've heard enough.   that was really great.  and everyone says i look exactly like sharpay.  really. yeah.  i don't see it.  i'm here. prepare to be dazzled.  excuse me, but i work alone.   . london tipton's really great .  . really great, really great .  . london tipton's really great .  . and deserves a bit of cake .  flit and flounce.  wow, um, thanks.  ooh. you want more. there are 10 more verses.  are they different.  in verse 3, there's an extra "really" in it.  well, that's really, really great.  next. ooh. that's me.  hit it, louie.   . i've got beef between my teeth .  . it would be boss .  . if i had floss .  this is from my unproduced musical, floss.  i found it on the internet and thought it was genius.  well, sing, boy, sing.  . the stick is stuck .  . i'm out of luck .  that was beautiful.  the audition results are on the school web site.  i can't look. cody, you do it.  yes. fantastic.  i'm sharpay.  no, i got the part of troy.  who cares.  yes. i'm sharpay's understudy.  .  i can't believe it.  how could i not get it.  hey, guys. great news.  i'm playing sharpee.  u she got my part, and she can't even pronounce the name.  who cares what her name is.  i'm just happy to be in musical high school.  aargh.  i can't believe i'm an understudy. it's insulting.  i might as well be a lousy stagehand.  heh heh.  no offense.  none taken.  i think this whole thing is lame.  i just just don't understand why london got my part.  i can sing, i can dance, i can actcan you work a power painter.  mr. blaine. yeah.  sorry to bother you, but i was just wondering why i didn't get the part of sharpay.  um, look, maddie.  ..  you're just too nice to play the role of sharpay.  i mean, she has got to be really mean.  i can be mean.  sometimes, when i give sandwiches to the ..   i don't cut off the crusts.  oh.  ooh. you are motorcyclegang material.  oh, yeah. grr.  london, antonio, let's take it from the top, please.  top of what.  that means the beginning.  oh. heh heh. amateur.  blaine, antonio called me a bad word.  i'm sure he did, sweetheart. and music.   . i believe in dreaming .  . shooting for the stars .  . baby, to be number one .  . you've got to raise the bar .  . kicking and scratching .  . grinding out my best .  . anything it takes to climb .  both: . the ladder of success .  mr. blaine: ok, ok, ok, let's stop, please.   good. i need a spring water.  aw, come on. spray, you stupid sprayer.  maddie, can you hold this.  i'm going to find the instructions.  great, great job, london.  uh, but to be even greater, you may want to consider singing lessons.  well, if you think they'd helpand dancing lessons.  how could she have gotten this part over me.  don't you read teen theater magazine.  london's father is financing a broadway run of mr. blaine's play floss.  this is so unfair.  i can't believe that london gets everything just because she's rich.  ..  my dressingroom mirror's broken.  it doesn't tell me how beautiful i am like the one i have at home does.  uh, carl.  go stand in london's dressing room and tell her how beautiful she is.  that's it. ok, no more miss nice gal.  i'm gonna tell london the truth no matter how much it hurts her.   i love the theater when it gets catty.  ohh, maddie. did you see.  i'm great. ha. great.  the only reason why you got that part was because your daddy bought it for you.  i can't lieve it.  yeah, well, it's the truth.  i have to go thank him.  unh.  oh.  oh. can you show me how to do that.  guys, i've told you no playing basketball inside.  i'm not. i'm rehearsing.  ok. no rehearsing basketball inside.  mom, i'm a method actor.  and since i'm playing a jock, i've decided to live the role 24/7.  and even that isn't gonna be enough time.  not true.  i think i'm getting athlete's foot.  well, so far, that's the only athletic thing about you.  i've been practicing, and i'm starting to look like a real bballer.  . ice cream, ice cream cherries on top .  .  ..none.  my ball. my ball.  ..ahem. give me back the rock.  that was very believable, honey.  carey, my drama teacher thinks i could use a teensyweensy bit of help with my singing.  oh, i'd be happy to help. thanks.  do you know any good singers.  london, i happen to be a professional singer.  i sing in the lounge every night.  i thought that was karaoke and you hogged the mic.  now,
