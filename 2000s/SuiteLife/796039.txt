moseby.  i'll find out the truth.  boys, did you do it.  no. no.  pinky swear.  pinky swear. pinky swear.  there you have it.  oh, that proves it. yeah.  because in court, you swear on a stack of pinkies.  moseby isn't a morning person.  or afternoon.  12, he was kinda nice.  i can't believe moseby accused us.  we weren't even in the lobby last night.   did your butt just ding.  why is the bell from the lobby in my bed.  ooh. you did do it.  i did not. ii was in my bed all night.  i even remember having this weird dream.  i was piling stuff against the doors to keep the zombies ouooh. i did do it.  uh, but how did i do it.  you must have been sleepwalking because the movie freaked you out.  it did not freak me out.  .   ok, maybe it freaked me out a little bit.  this is bad.  if mom sees you sleepwalking, she'll realize we went to that scary movie.  and she'll treat us like kids until our kids have kids.  ok, tonight, we'll surround you with noisy booby traps.  that way, if you start sleepwalking, oh, and one more thing.  .  that never gets old.   ohh.  i told you to stop that.  ohh.  oh, it's go time.   london.  ..  just, uh, changing the tapey thing.  stick around,

massage. a hotstone sauna.  i have a coupon for this great place i know.  look, we can split a burger.  it's 10 minutes by subway.  ha ha ha ha ha.  ha ha ha ha ha.  i'm not taking the subway, i'm not splitting a burger, and i'm not paying with a coupon, whatever that is.  i wanna take my limo to chez robert and have the duck a l'orange with truffles.  yo, i don't think i have a coupon for that, though.  i don't need a coupon.  i'm gonna use this little thing called money.  brandon: where are you gonna get it.  i don't get it. i got it. get it.  i'm rich, stinkin' rich.  i have a stretch limo so long it only goes straight.  if i wanna turn a corner, i have to change limos.  ok, soso i'm gettin' the sense that you're rich.   . i knew you couldn't do it .  . i knew you couldn't do it .  why did you lie to me.  because i liked you, and you said you hated rich people.  yeah, when they're pushy and mean, but i mean, you're wonderful, so sweet, and downtoearth.  ohh.  ok, either london's a much better actress than i thought, or you're dumber than a wheel of cheese.  dang, maddie.  you're poor and mean.  let's leave her in her bitterness.  have you ever gone swimming in a limo.  oh, no, but i would love to.  oh, let's go. ok.  oh, for all i care, you could drown in that limo.  like the lifeguard would let that happen.  oh. what's with all the candy.  looks like a piata threw up.  london just tried to take my shift, but she couldn't handle being working class.  which means i was right, and she was wrong, so i win.  so you win. ah.  yes. yay.  oh, it is just wonderful, madeline.  i'm so proud of you.  here's your trophy.  to cody" on abc kids.  to cody" on abc kids.   must stop zombies.  zombies. must stop zombies.  zombies.   bubble wrap.     zombies.  zombies. must stop

my pajamas.  although as silly outfits go, i come in second.  you were sleepwalking, trying to protect yourself from zombie moms.  well, that's odd, because we didn't see that movie, right, cody.  it was zack's idea.  thanks, man.  i can't believe i gave you the freedom that you asked for, and then you abused it.  well, i don't find it hard to believe.  well, first of all, you are going to put back all of this furniture, and secondly, you ever disobey me again, you are going to wish you had a zombie mom.  remember that with more freedom comes more responsibility.  i'm sorry, mom.  me, too.  although one good thing came out of this.  what. zombie.  .  that just keeps gettin' better. )
