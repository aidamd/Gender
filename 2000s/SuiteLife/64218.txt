 but i'm really healthy.  but i'm really, really healthy.  and i'm really, really glad you're not triplets.  how about sports.  it's big bob on sports.  if you can bounce it, dribble it, kick it, or hit me in the face with it, i'm your man.  excuse us for a second, everyone.  look, you don't understand.  i need a job on the paper.  my only other option is joining the marching band.  what's wrong with that.  the only instrument left is the glockenspiel.  darlene would never go out with a guy who plays the glockenspiel.  look, i'm trying to run a newspaper here, not your love life.  if you don't give me a job, i'll keep making scary monster sounds while you're sleeping.  you're mr. spooky head.  fine. there's only one spot open on the paper.  the advice column. ask shirley.  you mean i'd have to be a girl.  no, it's anonymous.  oh. good.  that means no one will know you're shirley.  then that means i'm the man for the job.  i mean woman.  look, i just hold the paper to a very high standard, and i don't know if you're right for the job.  i give great advice.  that shirt makes you look like a dork.  one chocolate dingading.  what's the magic word.  now.  esteban, open this.  ok.  london, what is the matter.  someone is a little irritable today.  well, that's because i haven't gotten any sleep the past 2 nights.  well, usually when you can't sleep, there's a psychological reason, something deep down that is gnawing at your soul.  my soul.  of my otori vitaly shoes.  or maybe she just has a lot on her mind.  no. no. no.  i'm telling you, there's nothing wrong with my life.  well, then what's the problem.  i can't sleep.  and now i can't hear.  neither can i.  no yelling in the lobby.  so how's the column coming, shirley.  these people are all so pathetic.  listen to this loser.  "dear shirley, "i have a small perspiration problem.  "what should i do.  " dear sweaty, next time, let the letter dry before you mail it.  you can't make fun of people's insecurities.  you have to be more sensitive.  i can be sensitive.  i just found a gray hair.  congrats, grandma.  way to be sensitive.  it was hardly worth the trip in here.  fine, fine, fine.  i'll try to be more sensitive.   dear stinky boy, here's what you do to hide your sweat stains.  join the swim team and tell people you just came from practice.  that is the dumbest advice i have ever heard.  dumb.  and you call me insensitive.  lights off.  lights on.  i said lights on.  i said lights on.  ..  sorry, lights.     hello.  hey, maddie. it's me, london.  i'm in my room and i can't sleep.  what should i do.  ..  uhhuh.  is hang up the phone.  right.  now what.  maddie, this isn't working.    marion moseby. how may i help you.  moseby, i can't sleep. what should i do.  first, relax all of your muscles from your head to your toes.   now start counting backwards from 100.  ok.   ..  99.  you do it for me, moseby.  you're better at the alphabet.  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..ha...  moseby.  moseby.  ..ha...  i'm telling you, nobody's going to listen to your stupid advice.  i know it looks like sweat, but the truth is, i'm on the swim team and i just finished doing 100 laps in the pool.  would you look at that.  bob is sweaty in social studies.  but he's doing pretty well with the ladies, all thanks to shirley.  ok, so it worked for bob.  no one else is going to like your stupid column.  cody, i love the ask shirley column.  it's hysterical, and the advice is actually pretty good.  i think shirley's brilliant.  in fact, she and i are a lot alike.  tell her, cody.  i see no resemblance whatsoever.  you've got to tell her i'm shirley.  no. she's anonymous, remember.  well, that's not working out for me.  if you tell her, you're going to be in the marching band glockenspieling for the rest of your life.  maddie, the mints are overflowing.  i'm too tired to stop.  london has woken me up 4 nights in a row with her phone calls.  you, too.  i finally had my phones disconnected.  i'm telling you, something is troubling her psychologically.  the human mind is a complex thing.  miss tipton.  miss tipton.  miss tipton.  well, in most cases.  i am so tired.  no way.  ask shirley just got a letter from darlene.  how do you know it's from her.  she dots her is with a smiley face.  a lot of girls do that.  hers has a beauty mark in the shape of a heart.  "dear shirley, "i really like this guy, "but he comes on like a player "and he can kind of be obnoxious.  "but he is really funny and awfully cute.  " just ask me out, honey, and hope i say yes.  how do you know she's talking aboutoh, yeah. she said obnoxious.  i think i'll give darlene a little advice on how to take a crack at the zack.  what are you doing.  just watch.  sometimes a player isn't really obnoxious.  he's just hiding the fact that he's shy and sensitive underneath.  you can't do that.  why not.  because it would be using your position on the paper to manipulate someone for your own personal gain.  it's morally repugnant.  come again.  bad. wrong.  a nono.  oh.  that morally repugnant.  don't you realize you would be compromising your journalistic ethics.  you see, that's where you're wrong.  i have no ethics.  cody, we have great news.  really great news.  terrific, actually.  would you get to the point.  ms. cohen's looking for you.  she loves the paper.  she really, really loves it.  really.  she says you're the best editor we've ever had.  really.  and her favorite column is ask shirley.  really.  everyone loves the ask shirley column.  even the football players are having it read to them.  good work, team. all right.   well, from what i read, shirley does seem like my kind of woman.  think you could hook me up.  i don't think you and shirley are going to work out.  oh, you just wanna save her for yourself.  trust me. i don't.  so, isn't it great how much people love my column.  although it kind of creeps me out that bob wants to date me.  you could do worse, and you have.  actually, i'm hoping to do better.  a lot better.  you really think your advice to darlene is going to work.  " just taking a chance here, but would you like to go out for a milkshake.  gee, darlene, this is such a surprise.  i mean, i always thought you thought i was ..  obnoxious.  i did, but then i found out that some guys who are players might really be shy and sensitive underneath.  ..  that's me.  what's wrong with your brother.  he forgot his combination.  oh.  try this candy.  it's hard on the outside, yet soft and mushy on the inside.  kind of like me.  ..  i'm really having fun.  oh, me, too.  and the best part is i feel like i can open up to you.  just think of me as dr. phil with hair.  well, i've only had one boyfriend before, and it didn't turn out so well.  what happened. tell dr. zack.  he told me he had to study, but i caught him kissing my best friend at the movies.  what a jerk.  it took me forever to get over that.  like, almost a month.  well, you can trust me.  i know.  thanks.  no kissing in the lobby.  no. i'll get those things.  no, it's fine.  zack, why is your backpack full of ask shirley letters.  all right.  you caught me.  i cannot tell a lie.  i deliver the letters to shirley.  she lives in maine, someone stole her bike, she broke her leg, and she's afraid of the bus.  ok, i'm shirley.  that means you read my letter, which means you're the one who gave me the advice to ask you out.  yeah.  and see how great it worked out.  i mean, here we are, almost kissing in the lobby.  ha ha ha. no.  here we are almost kicking in the lobby.  oh. ow.  what was that for.  that letter was written in confidence to shirley.  now that i know it's you, it changes everything.  you lied to me to make me like you.  i never want to see you again.  mom, come see the new edition.  i changed the font.  i went with helvetica.  i'm proud of you, honey.  i don't like to admit it, but i owe a lot to zack's ask shirley column.  it's taken him 13 years, but he finally pulled through for me.  i'm quitting the paper.  what. why.  darlene found out i was shirley, and now she hates me.  so. use the paper to find another girl.  ..  .  no. i really hurt darlene's feelings.  i don't deserve to be giving advice to anyone.  find yourself another shirley.  i can't.  no one's as obnoxious and insensitive as you are.  don't sweet talk me.  i'm not going to change my mind.  oh, yes, you are.  you have a responsibility to your readers.  they want shirley. they need shirley.  they trust shirley.  you know what. you're right.  shirley does have something to say.  that's my girl.
