 "if found, return " here you go.  oh, thank you.  look, i'm sure kirby wants to do more than just pass.  yeah, i kinda " you know, so my mama can put it on the fridge.  would you forget the cards.  without the cards, how is kirby supposed to remember crucial facts, like "when columbus discovered america".  easyfootball.  come again.  the answer is 1492.  i just think of the quarterback brian greasy, who attended christopher columbus high school, wears #14 and has 92 career interceptions.  1492.  wow, zack.  you really are smart.  oh yeah.  and how is that gonna help you in botany.  there's no quarterback named phil o'dendron.  i have a whole different system for botany.  what's that.  "  good morning, internet.  welcome to another installment of the hit series, "yay me.  .."  shh.   ..tipton." today, due to the overwhelming response to "yay me's" "boo you," we'll once again be pranking my snoring roommate, bailey.  cockadoodledoo.   is it my morning to milk the cows.  boo you.   what's going on.  ody, zoom in on her head.  she's got crazy robot parts.  wait, wave to the world.  hi, world.  so how does it feel to be booyoued again.  ..  again.  i'm sorry.  i don't understand your crazy robot talk.   woody, that camera's coming out of your salary.  .  so kirby, are you ready.  absolutely.  i have now the high school equivalency test is ratr long.  it covers five subjects, 14 subsubjects, and ends with a 2,000word essay.  well, i know what the first word is.  " well, don't worry.  you'll do great.  oh, i'm not worried.  what would make you think i was worried.  sit tight.  i'll get a bucket.  man, i hope kirby's gonna be okay.  i mean, seven hoursthat's a long test.  don't worry.  they only give seven hours to people who need it, like you.  he'll be out before you know it.   or maybe sooner.  oh, poor k.  he couldn't get past the first question.  what was it.  " i hate that one.  kirby, what happened to you.  i was sitting there all ready to take the test, then i realized i have testophobia.   how long do you have, big guy.  no, he means he's afraid of taking tests.  i guess the truth is i'm just afraid to fail.  that fear takes over my whole body, i get all sweaty, my leg twitches and my eyes start blinking like a movie ..   kirby, a lot of people are scared to fail.  you just need to find a way to relax your mind and conquer your fear.  well, i don't know, guys.  afraid. you.  i mean, this is coming from the man who caught that guy trying to sneak out of the buffet with his pants full of shrimp.  that guy was five.  my point is you weren't scared then and you shouldn't be scared now.  you're right.  i have nothing to be afraid of.  oh, walker lady.  nuhuh, run.  oh, bailey, do you like this outfit.  nope.  are you still mad at me.  yep.  normally, i like oneword responsesbeing easier to understand and allbut come on, give me a long, boring story about how back on the farm the chicken dated the cow and they broke up because they couldn't agree on how to raise their children.  london, don't you realize you embarrassed me in front of holden, the whole school and the entire world.  not theentireworld.  we only got 37 million hits.  okay, i'm sorry i embarrassed you, and i promise i won't do it anymore.  that's what you would say if you were going to "boo you" me again.  but i'm not.  and you would say that to throw me off guard.  well, i'm not that smart.  but now that i said it, you're smart enough to retain it.  retain what.  boy, you're good.  good at what.  okay, kirby, to help you relax and get over your testophobia, we will be channeling the threetoed sloth: controlling our breathing, slowing our heart rate.  now let us harness the methodical grace gerhead turtle.   nuhuh, big man don't flow like that.  contorting yourself is not relaxing.  relaxing is lying on a sofa eating cheese doodahs.  oh, i can do doodahs.  i can do doodahs all the doodah day.  don't question the turtle.  heneedsthe turtle.  no, he needs cheesy snacks.  who uses cheesy snacks to study.  really smart mice.  how do you wanna relax, kirby.  yeah, kirby, how.    holden.  wow, this invitation really was from you.  yeah, i thought it would be nice to have dinner together.  are you sure.  last time we ate together, i hawked jalapeno on your shirt.  i'll risk it.   okay.  you know, since the first time i saw you, i wanted to ask you out.  really.  yeah, really.  i think you're adorable.   okay.  so when london came to me and set this whole thing up, i was thrilled.  wait a minute.  london set this up.  yeah, and wasn't that nice of her.  i knew it.  where's the camera.  what camera.  is it in one of these rolls.  no, it's not in any of the rolls.  what are you doing.  ow.  maybe it's in the butter.  there's nothing in the butter.  okay, what's going on.  oh, i get itflowercam.  bailey, what are you doing.  oh, i'm sorry.  did i ruin your stupid show.  well, boo you, london.  booyou.  but this isn't " it's not a prank.  i arranged this dinner to make it up to you.  huh.  you see.  holden really likes you.  i did, before i became a human buffet.  so this was a real date.  yeah, i was trying to be nice.  gee, for some reason, after becoming the download dork of the day, that thought didn't occur to me.  i don't know what to do.  i mean, you get mad at me when i make you the star of my show, you get mad at me when i set you up with a cute guyyou know, there's just no pleasing you.  you're right, london.  this is allmyfault.  no. not all of it.  a small part of it was mine.  i'm sorry.  thank you.  but boy, did you blow it with holden.  and he iscute.  and available.  now when kirby comes in to take his test, he will be relaxed by the soothing sounds of trickling water.   bloop.  are you trying to relax him or make him go potty.  now this baby this baby is what he needs.  and check this out.   actually, i just came to tell miss tutweiller i can't do this.  sure you can.  you know this material inside out.  for example, name a place where portuguese is the main language other than portugal.  that's easy.  angola, brazil, cape verde, guineabissau, mozambique, macau and bento's brazilian barbeque.  best yucca fries this side of sao paolo.  and if you went to vietnam, you would exchange your dollars for what.  dongs, and you better exchange 'cause the dong is strong.  and i'm sure you know what the national dance of bulgaria is.  who doesn't.  it's the trakijsko horo, and a lot of people do it in place, but you're really supposed to travel to the right.  diggadiggada.  diggadiggada.  diggadiggada.  otherwise, you're doing the divatensko and you just look silly.  you see.  you know all the answers.  yeah, but i still don't think i can make it through that test.  you just did.  huh.  the world studies section anyway.  i don't understand.  you see, cody and i realized that instead of helping you, we only made you more nervous.  so we figured the best way to get you to pass the test was to trick you into thinking you weren't taking it.  miss tutweiller saw you answer all those questions on a video feed.  and all these years, i had no idea i had no idea i was doing the trakijsko horo wrong.  oh yeah, it's just the hips.  you gotta go to the right.  i know, i saw.  so we borrowed one of london's webcams and hid it in this apple.  wow, a fruitcam.  now that's clever, boys.  thanks, guys.   if all of you believe in me this much, then how can i not believe in myself.
