 whoa.  you found it.  this whole thing is so unfair.  know i left that skateboard by the candy counter.  i just don't see how it got to the other side of the room.  hi, zack. hi, kid who looks like zack.  actually, i prefer cody.  that looks like fun.  shoot the little monsters.  and you need to watch out for the evil space monkey.  littleirl.  i'll lend you some money and teach you how to play, too.  please. who's gonna teach you.  she should learn from a pro.  step aside.  you're grounded, remember.  this isn't for fun.  i'm teaching the little girl a new skill.  " " ok, now, you grab the controller, and as soon as you see the simians, start shooting.  i'll never be as good as you.  you'll get the hang of it.   don't feel bad.  that monkey's really devious.  i just feel bad that you're wasting all your money on me.  please. don't worry about the money.  can i have another buck.  listen. why don't we have a playoff game.  and if you win, i'll get daddy to pay you double what you've loaned me.  but if i win, which is like impossible, then you pay me. ok.  that sounds fair.  no, it's not.  you know you're going to win.  you're suckering a little girl out of her money.  her dad's money.  and it's his fault i'm in trouble.  well, i can't watch this.  i don't want you, too.  wow, holly. you're doing really well.  take that, evil space monkey.  i did it. i won. you're an awesome tutor.  yeah. i guess so.  thanks, zack.  you're my best friend in the whole world.  and don't forget. you owe me 40 bucks.  these brownies are fabulous.  where did you learn to bake like this.  cheap charlie's.  you get 'em free when you buy snow tires.  ooh, ooh, ooh. it hurts to laugh.  i think maybe now i should alternate with the heat thing.  they say you should do that.  yeah.  oh.  ah. sorry.   all right, ok. got it.  hi.  ok.  good morning, mr. o'neil.  a little gift from the tipton.  why did we have to give him all the heavy fruits.  what's wrong with a banana and a handful of raisins.  just put it down. it's not that heavy.  oh. hey.  ohh.  i ok.  well, i hope you are feeling better.  oh, i am. as good asooh.  ooh.  ooh.  ohh.  perhaps a free day at the tipton spa might help ease your pain.  soon you'll be relaxed from your nose to your toes.  yes, and on your way checking out of the hotel, spreading the good word about the tipton.  oh, you can count on that.  yeah, that's why i told my doct i wouldn't call my lawyer.  lalawlalawwell, you know lawyers.  somebody always has to be responsible.  did i mention that esteban is available to you 24/7.  that's right. i all yours, sir.  24 minutes out of the next 7 hours.  no, that's 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  ayyiyi. that's a lot.  oh, hi there.  will you play a game with me.  i'd love to, but i have to work.  that's ok.  i'm pretty much used to playing by myself.  my daddy travels all the time, so i don't have any real friends.  oh, wait. wait.  maybe i have time for one quick game.  great. here's how it works.  there are 2 black cards and 1 red card.  all you have to do is keep your eye on the red one.  sounds easy enough.  which is the red.  that one.  you're good at this game.  it must be because you're so smart.  thanks.  hey, how about this time we play for candy.  if i win, i get a candy bar.  that sounds fair.  which one is it.  oops. got you that time.  one candy bar, please.  i was sure it was that one.  why don't you try again.  the odds on you winning are 2 to 1.  sure. what have i got to lose.  i can't believe you wiped me out.  we could play again and you could win it all back.  i have no more candy.  i like your watch.  i'm telling you, that little girl is evil.  i bet her head spins around.  thanks for playing with me, maddie.  you're my best friend ever.  esteban, can you please help me with this bag.  of course.  hey, sweet thing. holly clean you out, too.  it'll take 3 weeks salary to replace all that candy.  wait. let me guess.  holly let you win at first and then she got really good.  now that you mention it, yeah.  still think she's just an innocent thirdgrader.  ok, i see your point.  but she's just a little kid.  where would she have learned to con people like that.  i'm thinking she was homeschooled.  i'm telling you, holly and her dad are up to something.  i did not just leave my skateboard lying around.  my roller skate.  completely unrelated.  man, have we gotten bigger or have these vents gotten smaller.  i don't know.  but i suggest you get your knee out of my kidney or we're all gonna be sorry.  hi, daddy. esteban
