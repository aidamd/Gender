 hey, what happened.  you grew too old for a blankey but not too t0uoli.re what's the deal, man.  ol)xp6re bridget, save it.  we know haveey, w nam d ahem. now, who wants to snuggle.  chef boyardee.  the saucx you neure trix absofruitalicious.  i flew over the lemony green sun...  to berry blue island for a duel.  but that was my last bite of trix.   nooooo.  silly rabbit, trix are for kids.. aaaah.   trix cereal,part of a good breakfast.  okay, honey, i've finished all your laundry.  light starch.  of course.   you did not just put my sweater on a hanger.  sorry, sweetie.  i'm doing my best.  uh, honey, can i have another sip of juice.  more juice.  you've had a lot.  and i don't really like where that's headed.  okay, i guess i'll get it myself.   mouth so dry.  i can't reach.  you know, it's funny how thirsty you seem to get when you haven't even walked or done anything.   i'm doing something.  i'm telling you how to do the laundry.  yeah, i really enjoyed the sock folding video.  um, i'm feeling a little chill.  can you grab me a blanket.  sure, sweetie.  how's that.  nice and toasty.  can you tuck me.  anything else.  maybe a foot rub or fresh shrimp cocktail.  oh, that sounds nice.   " ah ah.  too tight tucking.  oh, let me fix that for you.  ah.  you really should vacuum down here.  and my little marcus is already reading.  wow.  he's 16.  still, that's impressive.  well, i can also tie my own shoe.  why do you think miss tutweiller called us up here.  i don't know.  welcome to " contestants, take your seats.    ahem.   ow.  okay, let's get started.  oh, wait wait.  my husband isn't here.   howdely doodely, kids.  zacko the clown is here.   sorry i'm late.  i was coloring my hair.   ok, good marriages are based on partners knowing and understanding each other.  so when i ask a question you each will write down your answer and we'll see how well your answers match with your spouse.  spouse means the person you're married to, not a cross between a spider and a mouse.  the first question is for cody and bailey.  cody and bailey, who wears the pants in the family.  bailey.  ..  not cody.  because despite the fact that i wash, iron and starch cody's pants, he only wears pajamas.  okay.  cody.  uh, i left it blank.  you see, the question is unclear.  technically pants is an abbreviation for pantaloons, which no one wears these days.   okay.  the next question is for woody and addison.  woody and addison, how many kids would you like to have.  addison.  well, considering how fantastic marcus is, i'd like to have a lot of kids, like five, six, seven, eight.   they could join a boy band.  unless i had girls, in which case it'd be a girl band or a combo group like the partridge family.  so a big family.  that's sweet. woody.  zero.  i love you too, dad.  okay, next question is for zack and london.  zack and london, what is the last book your spouse read.  let's skip that one.  okay.  okay, what is the single most important thing in a successful relationship.  london, what did you write.  i drew a picture of me.  aren't i pretty.  moving on.  zack, let's see your card.    whoa.  and it's all tied up at zero.  back to couple number one.  this is an emergency.  i've taken you to the bathroom enough times already.  just hold it in.  cody and bailey, if a relationship is like a cake, you need a cup of sweetness, a tablespoon of respect and a sprinkleplease don't say sprinkle.   if you have to go to the bathroom so badly, just get up and go.  i'm sick of doing everything while you sit there whining and criticizing.  i wouldn't have to criticize you if you did things right.  you mixed up my soup and my bedpan.  not that the soup you made was any better.    that's it.  ow.  you go, sister.  kick him to the curb.  who needs husbands.  ow, that hurt.  ow, that hurt more.   oh no you didn't.  marcus, help.  i'm coming, mama.  oh dear, stop.  stop it.  anyone who throws another pillow will get an f for the rest of the semester.  eh, i've got nothing to lose.  bailey.   that's it.  if this is how you're going to treat me when we're really married, then i don't think we have a future.  i agree.  thank you, miss tutweiller, for saving me from wasting my life with the black hole of need.  ow.  you're welcome.  bailey, are you okay.  i'm fine.  i guess cody and i weren't meant to be.  it's better that i find out now.  oh.  how did you know that was there.  oh, this is where i come to cry too.  you know, because i have allergies.  i just thought cody was the one.  but i feel like i was giving more than he was.  look, bailey, the whole point of this assignment was to show you guys that relationships are about compromise, give and take, for better or for worse, in sickness and in health.  i should have been amore sympathetic to cody.  ..  look, bailey, i have rarely seen a couple as perfectly matched as you and cody.  i mean, don't let this little disagreement break you up.  i mean, you're young now.  but before you know it, you're gonna be a lonely old maid whose mother is calling her every 15 minutes trying to set her up with the loser sons of her bingo buddies.   i think your allergies are acting up again.  mmhmm.  i'm sorry, bailey.  no, i'm sorry.  oh oh.   you were right.  i was whiny.  but i should have been more sympathetic.  i promise you, if i ever really break my legs, i would crawl to the ends of the earth to make you happy.   he would crawl.  cody, i'll never find anyone as good as you.  i'll never find anyone as good as you either.  and i'll never find anyone.  these are beautiful, cody.    zacko.  whoa.  so the couples' challenge didn't go exactly as i expected, but i hope you all learned something.  i think we learned that marriage isn't easy.  yes, though it can be great, you shouldn't enter into it lightly.  i learned that i may actually have a career as a clown.    yeah, about that.  daddy isn't happy i'm married to circus folk.  that makes zacko sad.    whoaoh.  these are daddy's lawyers.  and i am not leaving this room until zack and i are divorced.  miss tutweiller, will you please tell london that we weren't really married so we don't really need a divorce.  oh well, then that was easy.  i guess you guys can forget about paying zack that whole milliondollar alimony settlement.  wait, what.  that wasn't me.  that was the clown talking.  by the way, one of those lawyers is single.  oh, london, don't be ridiculous.  the cute one.  does it matter.  not really.  class dismissed.  . there's 104 days of summer vacation .  . and school comes along just to end it .  . so the annual problem for our generation .  . is finding a good way to spend it .  . like maybe .  . building a rocket or fighting a mummy .  . or climbing up the eiffel tower .  . discovering something that doesn't exist .  hey.  . or giving a monkey a shower .  . surfing tidal waves creating nano bots .  . or locating frankenstein's brain .  it's over here.  . finding a dodo bird painting a continent .  . or dr your sister insane .  phineas.  . as you can see there's a whole lot of stuff to do .  . before school starts this fall .  come on, perry.  . so stick with us 'cause phineas and ferb .  . are gonna do it all .  . so stick with us 'cause phineas and ferb .  . are gonna do it all .  mom. phineas and ferb are making a title sequence. )
