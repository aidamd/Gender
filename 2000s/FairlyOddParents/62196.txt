is the greatest dairybased wish i've made in the last 4 minutes.  uhoh. my bad wish senses are tingling.  you've been saying that all week.  your bad wish sense isn't always right, you know.  , it aah. aah.  i know how to get trixie to notice me.  i wish i had an electric personality.  next time, i'll wish for rubber gloves.  aah.  please be ink.  all that means is timmy's due for a good wish.  come on, cheeseboy squarepants, make us proud.  aah.  you were saying.  ahh. mm. look at me.  i'm a tasty nacho with thirddegree burns.  aah.  mm. mm. mm. mm. mm. mm.  mm. mm. mm. mm. mm. mm.  mm.  man, that's the fourth bad wish this week.  i wish i could break this streak.  are you on a bad wish streak.  then call the wish fixers.  in just 5 days, they can turn your firebreathing dragon wish into a kindly dragon wish that respects children and breathes healthy sugarfree mints.  yay. yay. yay.  what. i'm not going to some dumb wish fixer.  aah. then again, maybe i am.  welcome to wish fixers.  , the head pixie who tried to take over fairyworld once ..  who is you.  why are you shouting.  i just finished a memory mending course, and i learned that speaking loudly helps you remember things.  i like pie.  for us pixies to control all magic and take over fairyworld is behind us.  really.  now please sign this contract so we can get this party started.  now my "i don't trust pixies" sense is tingling.  perhaps my associate jorgen von strangle can convince you again.  sign your names.  do it, or i will use your bones as toothpicks.  now, that was a convincing argument.  besides, maybe my wishing could be a little better.  now, the first step in our amazing onestep wish fixing program is don't makeany more bad wishes for 5 days, and yourbad wish streak will be broken.  or else. or else what.  yo find out.  timmy: these amoebas are so small, they're hard to count.  i wish they were bigger.  you've got it.   ouch. ouch. ouch. ouch. ouch. ouch.  unwish the wish. unwish the wish.  ok. ok. i wish the amoebas were small.  what the heck was that.  every time you make a bad wish, cosmo and wanda will be painfully, painfully shocked, and with each bad wish, the painful, painful shocks will get worse.  what. that's totally unfair.  no. it's hilarious. watch.   aah. aah.  shocking, isn't it.  i've got to write that one down.  luckily, my hat is also a pen.  you can't get away with this.  i'll just wish the collars were off.  but that would break the contract you signed, and if you breakthe contract you signed, we get to replaceyour fairies with pixies.  it's inthe fine print. see.  son of a gun.  i can totally go 5 days without making a bad wish.    aah. aah.  oh. so you want story, me pretty.  here's one about the time me undead horde laid waste to dimmsdale.  their defenses have been weakened by pigs. arr.    aah. aah.    still wishing badly, i see.   cosmo, wanda, i'm sorry.  i'm not making any more wishes until the 5 days are up.  but that would also violate the contract, which also means you get pixies instead of fairies.  it's in the fine print within the fine print.  timmy: son of a gun.  there it is.  especially when you see the last setting on their collar.  cosmo: a skull and crossbones.  i don't want to be a pirate and lay waste to dimmsdale, which is where you live.  i've made a list of approved, not bad wishes.  i suggest you follow it.  you want me to wish fairyworld was ruled by pixies.  i'm not gonna make that wish.  it's either that wish or pirates.  it's your choice, turner.  timmy: oh, man.  if i break the contract, you get replaced by pixies, and if i make a bad wish, you guys get wasted and replaced by pixies.  well, that one where we don't get wasted sounds pretty good.  this stinks.  there's no way out.  section 7, subparagraph a19, breach of contract. what.  if timmy makes an irresponsible wish that is at the same time responsible, they can't shock us, and the contract is null and void.  blue is a color.  a responsible irresponsible wish, eh.  h.p., do i have a wish for you.  is it the wish where you wish for fairyworld to be ruled by pixies.  if it's not, you've broken the contract, and you get to say goodbye to cosmo and wanda.  go me. go me. it's my birthday.  oh. don't worry. i've got a wish, all right.  i wish cosmo and wanda were made of rubber.  bad wish, turner.  say goodbye to your fairies.   gasp.  guess again, pinhead.  they're rubber, and rubber doesn't conduct electricity.  and since i didn't make the approved wish, you have to let me out of the contract.  because he made a responsible wish.  which is also irresponsible. watch.  whee.  it seems as though i have been trapped within my own loophole.  we'll see what my associate jorgen has to say about this.  loophole or not, i am now going to turn your fairies into pixies, boring, dull, unfun that's funny.  i don't remember jorgen being made of metal or having an extension cord sticking out of his butt.  jorgen is not made of metal, but he may have an extension cord sticking out of his butt.  i don't usually look back there.  you're right.  i wish the real jorgen von strangle was here.  uh, timmy turner, you've interrupted my cooking class.  if my souffle falls, i will bake youa mighty cake of death.  hey.  pay no attention to the pixie controlling the jorgen robot.  everyone, you remember my evil henchman sanderson.  sanderson, everyone.  hello, everyone.  so you're not helping the pixies.  huh. pixies.  why would i help these dull, pointyheaded wimps.  ow. i mean, yay. we're not rubber.  s are here to grant fun wishes of pain.  oh. wait. that is me.  of course, they did break me of my bad wish habit.  are you sure you don't have one more bad wish in you.  maybe.  finally, something more boring than we are.  oh, the singlecelled irony.  aah. aah.  nope. no cord.  at lego city police station the crooks are breaking out.  you can catch them, and put them back in prison.  the new police
