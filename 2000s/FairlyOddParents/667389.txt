missed you so.  ok poof, shapeshift into your little goldfish self.  i'll tell dad that you took off for outer space in search of your realturner.  you've got to get me out of here, bro, and, like, fix my fakeifier, yo.  i told you i'm not that in to you.  fishy.  no, no, poof, no fishy.     poof, no.  you're not an octopus.  you're a baby. a cute baby.  eh. timmy.  this looks bad, right.  stay here, away from your awesome brother, and think about why you can't treat him like shark food.  and speaking of food, time to go shopping, but where do we buy food for a super baby.  both: at the supermarket.  jinx.  tell us you have a new plan.  oh, yeah.  poof's really getting his shapeshifting down, so all we got to do is get him to shapeshift into something that will really scare the heck out of my mom, then she'll willingly give up poof.  good plan.  i wish this aisle was full of boxes of super fortified terrifying monster o's.   monster.  oh, ho, you want cereal.  let's see if there are any harmful ingredients.  raawwwr.  perfect, when your mom sees this, she'll definitely give up poof.   huh. raaaa.  let's see. sugar, fangs, venom.  mom.  mom.   mom.  woman on p.a.: gruesome

gonna hurt someone.  possibly me.  whoa.   aah.  man, i can't win today.  i know it's hard accepting a new member to the family, but come on.  .  now i don't want to see you trying to thinly slice your brother again.   aah.  he's a super baby from outer space sent to protect us.  ok, timmy.  we've been very patient, but we want our baby back.  i'm sorry, wanda.  i know if my mom could see she's breaking another mother's heart, she'd give up poof.  but she thinks he's an alien.  where are we going to find an alien mother that your parents will "willingly" give poof back to.  turner.  i have escaped from the fish prison.  can you please fix my fakeifier.  i will do anything you ask if you will only, like, help me, ok.  what's with the creepy smiles.   eee.  uh, ok.  greetings, earthlings.

our baby back.  someone needs a diaper change.  and it isn't me this time.  now i wish mark's fakeifier was repaired.  oh, marki mean, justin jake ashton, is their anything we can do for you.  i'll take that diaper to go.  ahh.  ok, time to repair my mom and dad's broken hearts.  so super baby's gone, huh.  he's where he needs to be.  with his real mom and dad.  i guess this mom and dad will have to settle for just one super son.  you guys think i'm super.  oh, ho ho.  the superest.  which means you need a super outfit if you're going to fight crime.  so i made you something that will go with those super teeth of yours.  i hereby dub thee beaverboy.  nobody takes a bigger bite out of crime.  awesome.  i'm a super son and a superhero.  blimey. a giant beaver.  good huntin' in these parts there is.  look, honey, it must be nap time.   diapers rock. ha ha heh.   wahoo.   timmy and poof: ooh.  ahh. ahh.  wahoo. wahoo.    yeah. it's a new record.  36 wishes in 5 minutes.  ..sleep...

snowboard.  wahoooo.  turner, your wish activity meter is off th charts.  you are all the way up to wishy mcgreedypants.  remember, your fairies are here to help you when you need it, not act as your private wish butlers.  yeah. i wish jorgen was gone.  nice try. now where was i.  you are weak, undisciplined, and are working your fairies much too hard.  am not. just ask cosmo and wanda.  working me too hard.  see. denial.  ..  that is why you must go to wishing well.  wishing what.  wishing well is a new stateofthe art retreat in fairy world where overwishing kids learn how to take care of themselves and stop wearing out their fairies.  i do not have o.w.d.  i wish jorgen was a soccer ball and i had a bionic foot.  like that will work.  aah.   nice kick. now off to wishing well.  oh, i'm sure timmy will be fine.  yeah, and now we finally get a chance to relax.  waah.  waah.  not relaxed.  welcome to wishing well.  hey. this place is kind of nice.  oh, wait. it gets better.   now say hello to the other two members of the inaugural class.  give it up for molly and dwight.  i wish you would all go away.  i wish my fairy irving was here.  i wish you would shut your trap.  yeah. i wish you'd shut your attitude.  i wish those alarms were off.  oh. this is going to be tougher than i thought.  poofy, stop crying.  maybe he needs a new diaper.  ooh. that's a yes.  be right back.  success, but we're gonna have to repaint the nursery.  and poof's still crying.  wait. i have another idea.  here. you hold poof for a second.  cosmo. cosmo.  not funny.  step one on your road to recoveryur biggest fears and try to conquer them without wishing.  what's with the anklets, jarhead.  somebody make a wish and find out.  i wish you were covered in fire ants.  ow.  a fruitcake.  who hits someone with a fruitcake.  jorgen: oh. i almost forgot.  your anklets will trigger our massive alarm system, which shocks you if you try to escape.  now let the stop wishing superfun training begin.  aah.  ugh. unh.  aah. vicky.  molly: aah. snakes.  dwight: aah. a harpoon.  i dreamt i was a whale once, and they wanted my blubber.  come on, greatest fears. get them.  i wish vicky was gone.  i wish the snake was gone.  i wish no harpoony.  ow. ow. ow.  nice job. no, really good.  you've proven to me that you can survive in the world without fairies, so i guess you can all go home now.  really.  you wish.  unh. ohh. unh.  now for step two of my wishing well program, the cafeteria.  where's the food.  if you want breakfast, you are going to have to make it yourselves.  your fairiescannot cook for you forever.  just show me where the oven is, and i'll make pancakes that will blow your taste buds away.  well, you blew up the kitchen.  that's close.  now you can all clean up this mess without wishing.  the garbage truck comes at 8:00.  then it's on to step 3.  i won't tell you what it is, but i will give you a hint.  it involves tying your shoes without wishing.  wow. that was a really big hint.  not even a bottle will stop poof's crying.  try my dolly. it calms me down.  i made it to fill the void since timmy left.  pull the string.  i didn't do it.  timmy.  cosmo, look.  poof isn't wet or hungry.  he just misses timmy.  but now i'm wet and hungry, and i miss timmy.  and now that i think about it, so do i.   all i asked was that you tie your shoes without wishing.  what if a real emergency hit and you didn't have your fairies to save you.  like a quicksand floor.   i wishi mean, help.  right. help.  what is the word i am looking for.  um, oh, yeah. pathetic.  did it occur to any of you overwishers to grab the bed frame or grab these convenient ropes hanging from the ceiling or simply turn the quicksand floor off.  it is good you will be here because i have a special test for you, and i'll give you a hint.  it involves scrubbing filthy toilets.  darn it. note to self, no more hints.  how does cleaning toilets get us to stop wishing.  jorgen: it doesn't help you stop wishing.  they were just really gross.  happy scrubbing. ha ha ha. ha. ha ha.  i'm done with fruitcakes and quicksand floors and toilets.  we're breaking out of here.  where are we gonna go, timbucktooth.  we're not going anywhere unless we team up.  i never thought i'd say this, but jorgen's right.  i do ask my fairies for too much, but i'm totally sick of this place, so i'm busting out tonight. no magic.  now are you with me.  i'm in. i'm in.  but don't touch me again.  wanda: you're right, cosmo.  making a sand castle does really get our minds off of you know who.  i don't want sandy timmy.  i want real, notsandy timmy.  i'm wet and hungry again.  wait a minute. we can go visit him.  you're right. to the real, notsandy timmy.  jorgen: time for bed, overwishing wimps.  lights out. nonescape lasers on.  ok. let's do this.  but how. jorgen locked the door.  doors. we don't need doors.  geronimo.  aah. it's our worst fears.  they want my blubber.  no. they're our ticket to freedom.  evil vickybot, please don't hack these special ankle bracelets off our legs.  we love them so.  feeling scared yet.  terrified.  i really am.  come on.  aah. aah. aah.  molly, snake time. you can do it.  i got over my fear of snakes without wishing.  yeah, but we still have to get over the wall.  dwight, grab the harpoon.  it doesn't want your blubber.  i'm not a whale.  i am not a whale.  ha ha ha. i did it.  time to climb.  now what.  timmy. oh, we missed you.  it took us forever to find this place.  so these are your fairies.  yep. pretty lame.  you're no prize yourself, sister.  i think they're cute.  awkward.  oh, no. jorgen knows we've escaped.  make a wish, and we'll get you out of this dump.  i really overwished you guys, and i'm sorry.  we'll take this one.  how. how.  we are doomed.  let's just say it's time to take out the trash.  3, 2, 1.  jump.  aah.  whoohoo. yeah.  touching. you're touching.  and now we're doomed, right.  no, but i will give you a hint.  you have graduated. oh, dang.  whoohoo. yeah.  you all made a daring and successful escape not by wishing but by working together on your own, and while i would like to punish you painfully, i will instead say congratulations.  yeah. yay. yeah.  ohh.  irving, this is the boy who taught me not to fear blubber.  you have really big teeth.  timmy, this is my fairy swizzle.  wow. molly's a really cool girl.  don't ever touch me again.  and i see where she gets it from.  now let us celebrate.  let us wish you guys up a graduation feast.  wait. we want to cook for you guys this time.  jorgen: who wants fruitcake.  dwight: they want my blubber.  paxhk0 hpp8xkx hpxk0d hpxkhpxkpohpxxwkhpxhokhpxhohpxk0xk pjxrk0pvpjxho0pjhwpk0pj k00:pj k0pj0:8"k0pjk0pjhrk ,h, ,h, ,hk, ,h,
