"wish limbo".  is that bad.  no, the erupting volcano and my use of the phrase "deadly state" mean everything is hunkydory fine.  listen, you wished for "both" of your parents to be the "best" surfer ever, right.  so. what's wrong with that.  it is impossible for them both to be the best at the same time.  they will be locked into eternal competition forever.  ah.  now, if you'll excuse me, i've got to go get some coconut shrimp.  aloha.  mom, dad, time to call it a day.  dehhehe, no can do, timmy.  i'm not quitting until your mother admits i'm the best surfer ever.  and i'm not quitting until your father admits i'mthe best surfer ever.  en garde.  they got to get tired eventually, right.  i'm not going to eat, sleep, or shave my legs till you give in.  i'm not going to eat, sleep, or shave my beard till you give in.  man, those hairy wack jobs are never going to leave the water.  this is the worst vacation ever.  i got to find a way to end wish limbo.  jorgen.  i don't know why the grass skirt is so popular.  i could swear there are crickets in here.  you got to help me.  how do i stop my mom and dad before they surf for the rest of my life.  that is the problem with wish limbo.  yeah, yeah, limbo, limbo, limbo.  how do you stop it, stop it, stop it.  the only way to break the spell is to get your parents to give up the competition on their own, but to do that, you must find something that means more to them than surfing.  how am i gonna do that.  that is for you to figure out, because i'm going to back to my fourstar hotel to order a pupu platter.  room service says it tastes better than it sounds.  i got to find something my parents love better than surfing.  ..and a shave.  poof.  mom, dad, wait.  if you give up surfing right now, i'll give you all this stuff.  check it out: a big flatscreen tv, a diamond necklace, and a pony.  well, the pony is tempting, but nothing can make me give up the chance to defeat your mother.  surf's up.  thanks, timmy, but nothing can make me give up the chance to show up your father.  wait for me.  time for drastic measures.  if i can't bribe my mom and dad into quitting, maybe i can scare them into it.  good thinking, timmy.  their own lives must be more important to them than surfing.  guys, i wish for the scariest surfing spot ever.  poof.   our greatest surfing challenge yet.  this dangerous patch of water should prove once and for all who's the best.  both: yay. yay.  timmy, your parents are gonna get creamed in there.  yeah, and they haven't even seen the giant kraken yet.  the giant kraken.   guess i didn't think this through.  i can't move my hands.  we're doomed. somebody, help.  look, that kraken just grabbed timmy and some weird pink, green, and purple sea creatures.   i'm gonna go save him.   trying to upstage me, huh.  i'm a better giveruppertohelpmyson than you are.   hold on, son.   poof.    uh, i don't feel very surftastic anymore.  help. help.  timmy, looks like wish limbo ended when your parents decided to save you.  you must be the only thing more important to them than surfing.  personally, i would've taken the pony.   let go of my son, fishbreath.  shoo. shoo. you heard me.   eh, i guess we didn't think this through.  guys, quick, i wish for a great big wave to get rid of that kraken.  on it. poof.    hmm.  cowabunga.  now who's the best surfer ever.  and thanks, poof.   dude, you are one amazing surfer.  let's get to that luau.  aloha.  " oh, honey, i'm really sorry. i apologize.  and i'm sorry too. i'm a great apologizer.  i'm a better apologizer than you.  i'm a better apologizer than you.  no, i am. no, i am.  yeah, that's gonna have to stop.  limbo. limbo.  both: limbo.  limbo.  from now on, this is the only kind of limbo i want to see.  well, i've only got one more day left in hawaii, so if i want to have fun, i'd better get crackin'.  one kraken coming up.   i think i made a pupu platter.  pupu platter.   ..  .. past boring scenery...  past a giant boring lizard eating a boring bus.    what's for boring dinner.  boring roast boar.  well, i'm not bored. i'm starved.  eh, you guys are boring.   man, i need food, and you two need some excitement in your lives.   both: boring.  eh.  guys, my mom got too bored to feed me again.  can somebody poof me up a submarine sandwich.  on it.  poof.  mmm. atomic sub.  don't even think about it, cosmo.  when you eat before bed, you get a stomachache and you sleepfloat.  oh, wanda.  you always know what's best for me.  if only i'd listen.    dive. dive. release depth charge.   it's attacking the japanese food i had earlier.  don't say i didn't warn you, cosmo.   um, wanda. some food.  aw, no, thanks. i already ate.  poof.     tummy hurts.   what was that.   oh, no. cosmo.  uh, mom, dad, i can explain.  .. with a periscope in his ear.  a ghost.  okay, let's go with that, but don't worry.  i bet his ghost wife is coming to drag him back to the fishbowli mean, back to the underwater realm of the undead.   sorry.  i told this idiot ghost not to eat that sandwich.  poof, poof.  our house is haunted.  do you know what this means.  it means we're no longer bored, ..  both: the poltergeeks.  the polterwhats.  oh, timmy, before you were born, your father and i led an exciting life as ghost hunters.  check out this cool vhs tape from the '80s.  i'm expert breakdancer and rookie reporter chet ubetcha saying, "our town has been destroyed "by selfproclaimed ghost hunters .." both: the poltergeeks.  tell us, poltergeeks, have you ever caught a real ghost.  not technically.  you see, we find a house we think is haunted.  then we just blow it up.  after all, you can't have a haunted house if you don't have a house.     enjoy your ghostfree house.  i didn't have a ghost.  you're welcome.  without ever catching a single ghost, the poltergeeks have destroyed every house in dimmsdale.  so i've brought an angry mob to run these polterfakes out of town.  no need to thank us.  chet ubetcha ran you out of town.  well, across town.  we moved from one side of dimmsdale to the other.  we even had to change our names.  i used to be called mom.  and i used to be called barnaby.  so since ghost hunting ruined your lives once, you're not crazy enough to try it again and ruin my life, right.  we're exactly that crazy, timmy.  there are ghosts here, so we better blow up the house right away.  i'll get the ghostblasters.  you get our totally unnecessary supertight jumpsuits.  whoa. hey.  have you guys ever tried catching a ghost.  ..can we still wear the jumpsuits.  uh, sure.  both: yay.  let's go, barnaby.    guys, help.  my parents are gonna blow up the house unless they catch some ghosts.  please play along.  you got it. three ghosts coming up.  ah, where are my feet.  how am i gonna finish my toe lint sculpture.   looking good, barnaby.  well, no ghosts here. fire when ready.  whoa, dad. the ghosts are right there.  catch 'em.  eh, with what.  these only blow things up.  why don't you just suck them into the ghost containment unit i wish you had.  ooh, fancy.  ooh, we're about to get sucked into a trap with great drama and ghostly noises.   wow, look at that.  you two finally caught some ghosts.  yawn. well, i'm bushed. good night.  are you crazy.  not according to the courtappointed psychiatrist.  now that we have a fancy ghostsucking device, we're going to hunt ghosts all over dimmsdale.  to the station wagon in our driveway.  the box was cramped, but on the bright side, we've never been closer as a family.  uh, about that, guys, if my parents can't catch more ghosts, they'll start blowing up houses again, so i need you to haunt every house in town.  are you crazy.  not according to the courtappointed psychiatrist.    is your house haunted.  no, there were no ghosts before, and there are no ghosts now.      good gravy, thanks for catching all these ghosts i never knew i had.  please take this as a token of my appreciation.  ooh, let's go see who else appreciates us.        crocker's house.  nah. just blow it up.  yay.     whoohoo.  wahoo is right, timmy.  barnaby and i have never been less bored.  or more rich.  now i can throw money at all my problems.  ah. thanks, turner.  dinkleberg.  glad you're having fun, sport, but we're sick of spending every night getting sucked into a box.  now it just feels like work.  but my folks love being ghost hunters.  now everyone believes in them.  this is chet ubetcha saying, "i don't believe " i'm going to expose you on tv as the total phonies you are.  oh, yeah.  eh, he's not going away, barnaby.  we're not phonies. we've caught tons of ghosts.  i won't believe it until i see it with my own eyes.  then meet us at the spooky old abandoned mansion i wish was up on the hill.  poof.   this is chet ubetcha's live worldwide broadcast outside the mysterious mccreepy mansion, and here come the polterfrauds now.    looking good, barnaby.  timmy, help unload our new ghosthunting equipment.  newghosthunting equipment.
