because i treated trixie like a person instead of just a girl, she remembered my name.  but she catapulted you out of the party.  yeah, but she did it with love.  and that never would have happened if you hadn't made me a girl.  thanks. but don't ever do it again. deal.  i wish you guys were back to the way you were born.  what.  this is the nose i was born with.  can't a guy do something to make himself look pretty.  blah, blahblah.  blah, blahblah.  well, your parents don't expect you home for a few hours.  what do you want to do now.  it's like they're scrubbing all my troubles away.  i've never met a boy sensitive enough to walk in here by himself.  i totally want you to date my daughter.  no, he should date mine.  i'm so proud of timmy. yeah.  he finally figured out that women love sensitivity.  aw.  and if you can fake that, you're in. ohh.  man on tv: i've got bad news.  roderick asked for a raise, and he's off the showi mean, fell down an elevator shaft.  women: roderick, no.

woman: students, we've called this big assembly to announce what this year's big musical production will be.   and now, with the big news, your drama teacher, mr. bickles.  this year's musical will be one of my own design, based on what, in my humble opinion, is the greatest series of films ever made.  ryan mccain, loose cannon cop, the musical.  what. that is the dumbest idea ever.  not so fast.  remember my edible wristwatch.  wanda: it didn't keep time, and it tasted horrible.  and that was my slogan.  starting tomorrow, one of you will have the chance to audition for the lead part of ryan mccain.  i need to find the most musical, macho, multitalented young male who can fight, sing, and hold his own next ..  not in a million years.  our female lead, the fabulous trixie tang.  i got to practice my singing.  has it been a million years already.  my watch must have stopped.   not on my watch   what the heck was that.  i don't know. i'm usually a pretty good singer.  but the idea of singing with trixie is making my voice stink.  what am i going to do.  for the tough questions, television always has the answer. here.  use my radioactive remote. )
