oddparents .  yeah, right.   you know what i just realized.  that your fly is open.  i only noticed 'cause i changed into your scooter seat.  sometimes even i marvel at the terrible choices i ke.  i realized everyone in dimmsdale has a pet but me.  mr. crocker has a parrot.  fairies.  fairies.  fairies. fairies.  do i really sound like that.  no wonder i don't have a girlfriend.  why am i in a tree.  even my dad has a pet rock.  okay, rocky. this is dinkelberg's scent.  sic him.   ah.  hee hee.  bad rocky.  oh, wait, this is timmy's shirt.  00 and there's a full moon.  it's just not fair.  why am i the only person in dimmsdale who doesn't have a pet.  timmy, i know you want a pet, but let's face it, your track record with animals is pretty bad.  oh, really.  i'd like to see some documented, videotaped proof of that.  this is chet ubetcha with documented videotaped proof that timmy turner is a terrible pet owner.  welcome to part five of our 12part miniseries: timmy turner: world's worst pet owner.  he fed his pet chicken scrambled eggs.   oh, my gosh. that could have been her baby.  he gave his pet mouse a pet cat to play with.  i really want scrambled eggs right now.  he took his pet snail on a field trip to the dimmsdale salt factory.  ah.  now i want salt on those scrambled eggs.  you're just not responsible enough to have a pet.  and there's no way your parents will let you have one.  we'll see about that.  i'm gonna ask them if i can have a dog, and i'm sure they're gonna say yes.  no, timmy. you can't have a dog.  how'd you know i was gonna ask that.  mother's intuition.  also, i heard you talking to your fish, who seem to totally understand you.  come on, dad. help me out.  no can do, timmy.  if i agree with your mother, she gives me treats.  bark. bark. bark.  good dad.  ugh.  i can't believe my parents don't think i'm trustworthy enough to have a dog.  i'm gonna prove them wrong by being deceitful and underhanded.  is there any point in appealing to your better judgment.  my whosamawhat now.  that's what i thought. what's your plan.  well, my mom is allergic to cats.  if you poof up a bunch of them, my dad will let me get a dog to chase them away.  i wish for a house full of cats.  mmm, mmm.   ahahahchoo.  boy, these carrot sticks went right to my hips.  and my hips went right to my face.    timmy.  there's a monster in the kitchen.  we'll need a dog to get rid of it.  you go and get one and i'll dive facefirst into this barrel of push pins i stole from work.   ow.  sometimes, even i marvel at the terrible choices i make.   well, the cat thing didn't work out quite how i planned it, but let's go get me a dog.    why'd you bring me to the fairy world pet store.  because you're banned from all the regular pet stores.  welcome to the fairy world pet store.  jorgen, you're working at the pet store.  i'm filling in for my niece, ginny von strangle.  she had her regional soccer championship.  i should probably be there, but there's no way i'm passing up $8 an hour.  jorgen, i'm here to get a dog.    he's super cute and friendly.  you don't want that one. he's not too bright.  that's not a nice thing to say about the dog.  i was warning the dog about you.  sit, boy.  speak.  what do you want me to say.  i know a lot of words 'cause i just ate a dictionary.  oh, my gosh. it's a talking dog.  i gotta have him.  sparky is a lot of work.  over the years, he has been brought back to the pet store more times than cosmo.   sometimes, i just get overwhelmed.  one day i will catch you, butt.  i know i can take care of him.  please.  you can have the dog, but not because i trust you.  my shift is almost up, and i want to hit the mall.  i work the yogurt store there, and there's no way i'm passing up $9 an hour.  you're my new owner.  you wanna see the other 83.  that's barbara and don.  they moved away in the middle of the night.  he went on vacation and never came back.  she played dead until i left the house.  i hate to interrupt this stroll down loser lane, but i've got to clean up some magic turtle poop.  just to clarify, the turtle is not magic.  the poop is.  here's the leash, collar, and magic doggy treats.    yeah. whoa.  whooah.    ugh.   aw, we're gonna have so much fun together.  one more thing, turnermagic flea powder.  you must put it on sparky every four hours.  you got it, jorgen.  good luck with the moron.  thanks.  once again, talking to the dog.  well, sparky, this is your new home.  i like it. i like you. i like everything.  i like this chew toy.   i'm so glad you're here, sparky.  so what other tricks do you know.  lots. wait here.    ires screeching] oh, wow. he's good.    psst, timmy.  is that the dog.  uh, what are you doing.  i'm hiding from the monster.  it's in the kitchen sneezing and trying to make me lasagna.  ahchoo.   sic him, sparky.    there's something weird about that dog.  he drives that motorcycle like a monkey, and that monster screams like a girl.  he's just a regular dog, dad. watch.  go fetch the paper, boy.  huh. hoo hoo.   i'm frightened.  no, sparky, the newspaper.    you better not be doing the crossword.  you owe me $7.50.  sorry, dad's not home. i'm a lamp.    hey, twerp.  i just got in a fightwith my boyfriend, justin jake ashton,moody teen dream with three first names, andi'm gonna take it out on you.    ah.   i protected you 'cause i love you, and because she scared the crud outta me.  whoa. you're the best dog ever.  there's a barrel of push pins down here.   timmy, you were right.  it was a good idea for you to get a dog.  it's been a great day for everyone.  except vicky.  okay, boys, time for bed.  why would anyone ever bring you back to the pet store.  technically, they drop me off in front.  they're scared of the magic turtle poop.   good morning, sparky.  how'd you sleep.  oh, magic dogs don't sleep.  i was up all night doing dog stuff.  i chased my tail, did a little digging.  aah.  whoa. what happened.  i buried the house.  i told you i did a little digging.  you wanna play fetch.  no. cosmo, wanda.  guys, sparky buried the house.  can you poof us back to the surface.  that's better. everything's fixed.  timmy. everything's broken.   look what your dog did to the house.  he chewed up everything and carpeted the hardwood floor.  now i can't hear when the monster's coming.  sparky, why'd you do that.  dogs chew, and i got a great deal on the carpet.   oh, my gosh. your dog can talk.  uh, no, he can't. he just barks funny.  i do. i bark funny.  werf. werf.  see. who does that.  timmy, you're gonna have to clean up this mess.  now, if you'll excuse me, i'm gonna go do my crossword puzzle.  oh, great, sparky already did it.   he did the jumble too.   whoa.  what's going on out there.   aah.   look, timmy, everyone's playing in the holes i dug.  you did all this.  yeah, i was really in the zone last night.  guys, sparky destroyed the city.  i need you to poof it back to normal.  we can't. sparky buried our wands.  like i said, in the zone.  i gotta party with you sometime.  oh, look, a new problem. sparky's got fleas.  right on, man.  timmy, did you remember to give sparky his magic flea powder.  ..n't.  anyway, what's the big deal.  timmy, these are magic fleas.  if they bite humans, bad things will happen. )
