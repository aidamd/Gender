 along with this chainsawshaped wallet.  oh.  just a sip will do the trick.    i'm cured.  ha. you chicken hawks don't scare me now.   i wish the conveyor belt would stop right now.   ah.  you people stole my chickens.  i'm ruined.  no, you're not, mr. dimmadome.  look at all these eggs.  you can se.  what an eggcellent idea.  this is doug dimmadome inviting you to tonight's grand opening of doug dimmadome's egg dippin' dippadome, where the food is eggstraordinary.  we did it, guys.  doug's back in business, and best of all, nobody's a chicken anymore.  guten tag.  who vants a vienerschnitzel.  ah. what's wrong with cosmo.  looks like a case of the german weasels.  achoo.  wanda, we must obtain a rare schnitzel from heidelberg.  don't worry. i know greta in the pharmacy.  i get five euros off if i give her a schnauzer.  i thought i was hot before, but this is ridiculous.  great.  the school romance dance is saturday night, and, as usual, i don't have a date.  well, at least none of my friends do either.  timmy, isn't it awesome.  we all have dates for the romance dance.  i created them in my lab.   yee. that was creepy.  well, i bet sanjay doesn't have a date.  timmy, meet my date, kimmy.  i have three goldfish.  that was even creepier.  that settles it.  i'm going to ask trixie to the dance.  i mean, the worst she can do is say no, right.  will you go to the dance with me.  no.  yay, fish sticks.  fish is brain food.  i read that inum, what am i talking about.  oh, no, i got another love letter from juandissimo.  he keeps sending me these smoochy notes with his photo and a statue of himself made of beef jerky.  the nerve of that guy.  i'd tell him to stop, but his juanjerkimo ismuy caliente.  that's spanish for something.  oh, love stinks.  i wish there were some way to make trixie fall for me.  i wonder if she'd take cash.  well, we'd like to help, sport, but you know the rules.  our magic can't help you with love.  but there is someone whose magic can help: that diaper dynamo of desire, cupid.  diaper, swim diaper, formal diaper, casual diaper, weekend diaper, party diaper, diaper cream, uninvited guests.  cupid, i need a favor.  will you shoot one of your love arrows at a girl so she'll go to the dance with me.  sorry, kid. cupid is off the clock.  i have been working my tushy off, and i need a vacation.  so i'm going on the fiesta del mexico cruise.   that's spanish for something.  well, toodles.  don't worry, timmy.  i'm sure you'll think of something really irresponsible mm, i know.  we'll take cupid's bow and arrows and shoot trixie ourselves.  hold on.  messing with cupid's arrows is really risky.  besides, they're guarded by his love birds.  like i'm really scared of some dinky love birds.   yes. romance dance, here i come.  okay, when trixie gets hit by one of these love arrows, she's going to fall for the first thing she sees, and that'll be me.  awesome, cosmo.  you knew i was going to ask you to play cupid, so you put on a diaper.  ..  right.  timmy, i'm telling you, this is a bad idea.  if those arrows end up in the wrong butt, you could ruin somebody's life.  juandissimo.  i love you.  in fact, i'm coming to you now.  oh, no.  my life is ruined.  on the bright side, maybe she'll bring back more jerky.  at least we know the arrows work.  let's go.  okay, when trixie opens her door, you hit her with an arrow.   i meant shoot her with an arrow.  what is it, now.   hey, trixie.  will you goodbye, hideous blight on my lawn.  i mean, hello, love of my life.  i'm going to call you rosie, .. any time.  ah. thorns.  ah, wanda, so beautiful yet so unattainable.  some men would tire of this endless pursuit, but i live for the chase.  wanda, what a surprise.  i was just about to send you more juanjerkimo.  like my love for you, it ismuy caliente.  that is spanish for something.  oh, forget the jerky.  kiss me.  uh, wait a minute.  this isn't how it works.  i am supposed to chase you, and you are supposed to run coquettishly away.  pucker up, jerky boy.  you have juanjerkimo on your teeth.  perhaps you should floss and brush first.  in the name of erik estrada, now you are scaring me.   cosmo, try to be more accurate.  you got it.  hey, what's "accurate" mean.  is that spanish for something.  wow, you're gorgeous.  come to papa.  stop playing hard to get.  please, wanda.  can't we just be friends.  or distant pen pals.   leaping lorenzo lamas.   how do i love me.  let me count the ways.  one, seven, avocado, europecosmo, focus.  i'm putting my picture all over the place so no matter where trixie looks, she'll fall in love with me.  hurry, timmy.  we have to stop your father from marrying a rosebush.  turner, i heard about your weirdo dad, so i brought you an "a" to cheer you up.  you get an "f" for foolishly believing i'd " cosmo, there's trixie.  shoot.  ooh.  eh.  crocker, i love you, even if you are the most repulsive creature in the universe.  let's go home to meet mother.  just don't eat anything she feeds you.  okay, that's seriously a problem.  but more importantly, trixie's getting away, and we're down to one arrow.   timmy.  wait, did i just say, "timmy".  will youowwith

wait to marry you.  we can get hitched right outside.  thanks to a shady flybynight website, mother is a justice of the peace.  say, rosie, how about we make it a double wedding.   come on, timmy.  let's finally kiss and make this the greatest night of your life.   ah.  crocker and a rosebush.  as much as i want to kiss you, i've got to save my family.  do you, denzel, take timmy's mom to be
