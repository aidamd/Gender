(] cosmo, you seem to care about this role more than poof does.  that's because poof has talent.  he could be a star.  not just any poof could be a star.  oh, timmy, i'm going to be a star.   huh. where are you.  right here, dad.  mmm, you sound like a graham cracker.  anyway, check me out.  i'm gonna gonna be in the annual skit at the pencil nexus company retreat.  i landed the role of pencil number two.  i just hope my performance isn't wooden.   " i get it, dad.  well, i'm off tosharpenmy acting skills.  " ooh, i should write these down.  if only i had a pencil.   there's the bus, sweetie.  have a good day a school, and good luck with the auditions.  poof.  there he goes, the future mister cookie.  he' and where's my coffee.   okay, children, later today, we'll be holding auditions for this year's play.   all right, who threw that.   foop.  it wasn't me.  .. sammy sweetsparkle.   although, for the record, if i had thrown a lighting bolt, it would have been done in protest over being asked to participate in this candycoated farce you call theater.  oh, it's not a farce, foop.  it's the touching story of a heroic cookie who rescues a princess.  is she kidding.  that's the lamest thing i've ever heard.  poofpoof.  we actually agree on something.  this could be the beginning of a new kinship between us, a bond forged through time that's stronger than steel.  poofpoof. exactly.  i couldn't have said it better myself.  we'll be friends forever.  high four.  now, children, i'd like you all to welcome a brandnew student to spellementary school, goldie goldenglow.  hi there, y'all.  friendship over. i saw her first.  zap.  poofpoof.  don't even think about it.  before the first school bell rings, that vision of beauty will be mine.  really.  'cause i was gonna ask her to sit with me at snack time.  splendid idea, sammy.  made you should ask her for a snack on jupiter.  poof.      you will pay.   poofpoof.  oh, please.  that's the oldest pickup line in the book.  watch the master at work.  zap.  poof.  hello, beautiful.  you must be 5 ccs of potassium chloride, because you just made my heart stop.  oh. oh, spiders.  how, uh, original.   and they're the more expensive poisonous kind.  ..gifts.     goldie, may i carry your books.  wow, that's awfully kind of you, floop.  " poofpoof.  you can't carry her books, poof.  ..  with that piano.  crash.    thank you, poof, and you too, fluke.  "  welcome, children, to the auditions formister cookie's happy day.  not interested, broomhilda.   no one cares about your insipid sideshow.    okay, let's begin.  mister cookie will be reading opposite princess sunshine, who will be portrayed by goldie goldenglow.  say what now. poofpoof.  wait a minute, doesn't mister cookie get a kiss from the princess at the end of the play.  why, yes, foop.  he does, but since you're not interested, i'm sure sammy sweetsparkle will be happy to play the part.  has anyone seen him.    as sure as there's a glog monster on jupiter, that role will be mine.  poofpoof. those are fighting words.  choose your weapon, swine.  boys, boys, there's no need to fight.  we will decide who will play mister cookie the oldfashioned way, with auditions.  to the death.  no, the normal way, and no weapons.  fine, then i'll defeat him with the most dangerous weapon in my arsenal, my talent.  okay, foop, let's see what you've got.  right.  i'll be going a bit offscript here.  you know, improv a few scenes and make them my own.    hello, gumdrop children.  ..  bringer of doom.   you've drawn your last breath, larry the lollipop.   my skeleton army shall render your candy kingdom asunder.  and now, princess sunshine, let us delight in the agony of others from the garden patio atop our tower of bones.  ..scene.   ha. top that, you purple poser.    poofpoof.   well, i think we've found our mister cookie.  congratulations, poof.  this is madness.  i deserve that role.  we'll find a part for you.  let's see, the lords of licorice are being played by the hex brothers.  ..  table number three.   but i should be playing mister cookie.  i'm more handsome and talented than poof.  i can speak in real words.  this is so unfair. cry, cry, weeping sounds.  now that's good acting.  how about if, in addition to playing table number three, you become poof's understudy.  understudy.  so if i were to do something horrible to poofi mean, if something horrible were to happen to poof, then i would get the role of mister cookie and the kiss from the princess.  yes, but for now, just focus on acting like a table.  you sounded a little like a graham cracker.  this is all too easy.  beware, poof.  table number three's coming, and you have a reservation with doom.    there's gum under here.  all right, children, let's begin rehearsals.  good morning, mister cookie.  it's such a gloomy day.  can you part these clouds so i can shine even brighter today.  poofpoof.  oh, goldie, poof, that was brilliant.   foop, please get off the stage, and take your sack of cobras with you.    you will all pay.   so much for operation sack of cobras.  luckily, mother packed antivenom in my lunch along with my chicken nuggets.   you may still be mister cookie, poof, but it shall be i who brings down the house.      all:  we turn our frowns    upside down    poofpoof   all:  when mister cookie comes to town   poofpoof.  ugh, this song is sickening.  wait, that's it.  i don't have to annihilate poof.  i just have to make him sick.   package for table number three.  thank you, my good man.  i'm a little short on cash.  there will be no gratuity.  poof.  ahha.    an infected gnome.  you really can get anything on the internet.  as they say in the theater, the plague's the thing.    gesundheit.  fortunately for me, i have a very strong immune system.     wellplayed, poof.   you may have upstaged me with a bout of gnomemonia for now, but soon it will be curtains for you.   with a little rewriting, i shall turn the tables on mister cookie.   crash.  in my new version, poof shall endure countless tortures, and the real hero of the play will be me.  poof, brace yourself for my new literary masterpiece, mr. cookie crumbles.     at buildabear workshop ..  ..  then dress it just right.  animals and outfits sold separately.  there's nothing else like it.  only at buildabear workshop.   the most fun you'll ever make.  0tms.  @p a 2dse

done it without all the obsessive parental pressure i put on him.  still waiting for that coffee.  poof.   there's the school bus.   there's my bus.  i'm off to the big corporate retreat.  i better run my lines one more time.  fancy computers are just a fad.   forgetting my lines makes me mad.  hey, great costumes, everyone.  cindy, is that you.  i'm a troll.  i know, but you have inner beauty.    ooh, pencil nexus went all out this year.  first the floating bus, and now this hotel in the clouds.  i better find pete from accounting.  he's playing the blue notepad to my pencil.  we have to rehearse that part where i write on his face.    ah, the theater.  this is the theater, right.  last time i was here, i was under a table, so it's hard to tell.  boy, i sure hope poof isn't nervous.  ah, relax, wanda.  i'm sure all the kids are getting a pep talk right now.  ..  and goldie.  powers will be unable to attend tonight's performance, because she's found herself somewhat incapacitated.  well, i know someone who's got detention.  and as you can see by this note which was written of her own free will, i am now in charge.  " congratulations. you can read.  i wonder if you can read upside down.  zap.  oh, hello, leonard.  powers instructed me to hand out these brandnew pages of the play.  it's basically the same except for the new dialogue, different sets, prerecorded narration, and hightech special effects.  why, thank you, fooch.  it's foop. okay, places.  ..  ..or spine.     uhoh.  poof.   poof, what's wrong. are you under the weather.   poofpoof.  what's that. you've got gnomemonia.  you're too sick to play mister cookie and need your understudy to take over.  poof.  poof.  looks like you're my leading man, fluke.   yes, i'm the star of the show now.  i knew my plan would work.  i'm a genius.  oh, no. i'm an idiot.  all the horrors i've written for mister cookie shall now befall me.  stop the show. stop.   powers and her class are proud to present mister cookie's happy day.  i meanmr. cookie crumbles.  thank you. enjoy the show.  it was the end of days.  civilization had fallen. anarchy ruled.   out of the apocalyptic wasteland stepped one lone figure.   a stupid, round, purple thing who was really dumb.  he thought he was a hero, but what he was was doomed.    boy, this is really different than i remember.  hey, i thought poof was playing mister cookie.  well, that's showbiz.  one minute, you're the star.  the next minute, you're married to some pinkhaired lady who won't get you coffee.  more coffe wom.  mister cookie's quest was toree the princess, but this would not be easy, for the land was fraught with horrors, and he was a big stupidhead.  all right, foop, just avoid all the booby traps you set when you thought poof was playing mister cookie.  it shouldn't be a problem.  fire rained from above.   that's a problem.  swarms of living buzz saws swooped down from the blackened skies.    i remember liking that when i wrote it.  and sharks with the bodies of horses rode in across the horizon and ate him.    this is the most awesome play ever.  blacked out there for a moment.  please tell me the play is over.  and that was just the beginning.    poofpoof.  what. i thought you had gnomemonia.  you're a better actor than i thought.  well, why don't you try your acting skills on jupiter.  poof.    poof.        then mister cookie saw the castle of the cookieeating monster wherein lay the object of his quest, princess sunshine.  help, y'all. help.  mister cookie, only you can defeat the lords of licorice.   i mean, the giant flaming cyclops with crab hands.  oh, dear.      you're on your own, princess.   hey, pete. great blue notepad costume.  get ready for me to write on your face.  who are you, and what are you doing in my show.   boy, pencil nexus really pulled out all the stops.  that flaming cyclops is way better than last year's.  hey, what's my dad doing on stage.  beats me.  the big pencil doesn't come in till act four.   zap.    eh, cyclops goes berserk. that's my cue.  hi, everybody.  i'm here to say fancy computers are just a fad.  they'll never replace the pencil and the pad.   nailed it.  ooh, i'm probably the greatest actor ever.     this is one weird play.  both: help. help.  help. help.    poofpoof.   whee.   zap.   poof.  all seemed lost for the dimwitted mister cookie.  what have you done, flop.  it's "foop," you triangular twit.  one "f," two "o"s, one "p." it's not that difficult.  just then, an impossibly handsome warrior rode over the horizon, bathing the wasteland in his heroic glow.  mister cookie was about to be rescued by table number three.  ah.  he's playing table number three.  wow, they really beefed up the role.  all i did was hold a flower pot on my head.  table number three slew the monster with his charm.   slaughtered it with his handsomeness.   and smote it with his smile.      ah, thank you, table number three.  you're the bravest piece of dining furniture i've ever seen.  for rescuing me, i will now bestow upon you the kiss of princess sunshine.  no.  that's supposed to be my kiss.  you've done just about enough damage for one day, young man.  this never happened to shakespeare.  and with that, princess sunshine bestowed her kiss on table number three.    all: aw.   together, table number three and princess sunshine lived happily ever after.   i'm so proud of you.  me too, poof, and look, thefairy timesalready gave you a rave review.  cosmo, that's the menu from the school cafeteria.  oh, then i have even better news.  you're having meat loaf on friday.  well, well, look who's here.  michelle from payroll.  your beaver costume looks a lot like my son.  poof, thank you for saving me from floon's horrible play.  it's "foop." you're a real hero.  poofpoof.  oh, i would love to get ice cream with you.     pain.  sorry, fluke.
