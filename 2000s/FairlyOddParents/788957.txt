 hey, sparky.  what's with the hearts floating over your head.  are you in love.  sure looks that way.  if he had to go to the bathroom, there'd be a kidney floating over his head.  i'll be right back.   i am in love, timmy.  check it out.  you're in love with that dog in dinkleberg's yard.  yeah. her name is peaches.  she's beautiful and smart.  okay, she's beautiful.  the point is she's my one true love.  she's all i can think about.  hi, timmy.  i see you've met my new dog peaches.  i rescued her from the pound while i was on my way home from saving a group of senior citizens from a burning bingo hall.  here, timmy. you can have my reward money.  don't you dare give free money to my son, you monster.  okay, then how about some homemade brownies.  they're sugarless, glutenfree, and they actually help you stay fit.  keep your hippie brownies to yourself, you bottomless well of evil.  well, i guess i deserve that.  i should've brought a glass of wholesome, refreshing milk.  dad, what is wrong with you.  oh, lots of things.  in fact, your mother made a list.  no, dad, i'm talking about the way you treat mr. dinkleberg.  why can't you just get along with him.  like the way sparky gets along with his dog peaches.  so what do you like to do.  oh, eat poop with a bee on it.  cool.  sparky turner.  back away from that dinkledog.  no turner shall ever associate with a dinkleberg.  you're coming with me.  my eyes.  uh, dad, aren't you overreacting.  probably.  overreacting is number 243 on your mother's list of things that are wrong with me.  number 249 is running out of the house without any clothes on.   hi, mrs. shikadance.  i can't believe your dad won't let me see peaches, timmy.  look at her. she's pretty and graceful.  okay, she's pretty.  sparky, i'm sorry my dad gets so crazy and unreasonable.  those are numbers 122 and 48 on your mom's list.  but you're a magic dog.  you can just poof over to peaches any time you want.  you're right. your dad will never know.   you're busted, romeo.   hi, mrs. lettergerber.   poor sparky.  he's brokenhearted.  you can tell by the broken hearts floating over his head.  i thought those were broken butts.  i broke my butt once.  it's still cracked to this day.  cosmo, what is wrong with you.  oh, lots of things.  wanda made a list.  ow.  that's number 26.  recklessly unfurling lists.  oh, sparky.  i feel bad that i won't let you see that dinklebeast next door.  so you're gonna let sparky hang out with peaches.  and possibly, hopefully get dressed.  heavens, no.  that would show a level of maturity that number 71 on the list clearly states i don't have.  anyway, i've decided to fix sparky up with a new lady dog to take his mind off peaches.     check her out, sparky.  she barks a lot, but she doesn't shed.  that's a seal, dad.  you lied to me. get out.  let's bring in bachelorette number two.  i found her in mr. crocker's yard.    dad, that's mrs. crocker.  oh, so she was telling the truth.  get out. i'm gonna need a ride home.  out.  all right, bachelorette number three.  i think you're really gonna like this one.  come on in, voodoo.   ahh. dad, that's a timber wolf.  no wonder it growled at me when i put lipstick on it.  i was just trying to make you look pretty, voodoo.   face it, timmy, your dad's never gonna let me date peaches.   look at her.  she's not just pretty. she's clever too.  oh, please.  she left the bone on the ground and buried herself.  i'm surprised she doesn't have a broken brain floating over her head.  i have an idea, sparky.  there's no way i'm dating mrs. crocker.  no, if we can just get my dad to like peaches as much as you do, then he'll let you date her.  judging by the wand floating over timmy's head, i'd say he's about to make a wish.  that's your wand.   i wish my dad liked peaches as much as sparky does.  oh, timmy.  i have great news.  i finally got dressed.  also, i like peaches now.  does that mean you're gonna let sparky spend time with her.  no way.  that beautiful lady dog is all mine.  i'm in love with her.  okay. unwish that wish.  no can do, sport.  it's against the rules to unwish true love.  are you saying my dad's romantically in love with peaches.  what are we gonna do.  i'll tell you what i'm gonna do.  i'm gonna battle your dad for peaches' love.  it's boring living with you, timmy.  nothing ever happens.  get lost, sparky.  with this heartshaped box of chocolates, i'm gonna win peaches' heartshaped heart.  in your dreams, old man.  i will bury you.  seriously, in the backyard next to my favorite tennis ball.  ooh.  someone learned a fancy, new language just to impress peaches.  well, two can play that game.  woof, woof, woof.  hey, boys. peaches is at the vet.  she got stung by the bee in the poop she ate.  but you're welcome to come in for some organic carob chip cookies.  i said no hippie food, you ambassador of the underworld.    .peaches .  . i wanna take you to the beaches .  . if you fell in a swamp .  . i'd pick off the leeches .  . don't listen to sparky .  . he's full of malarkey .  . if you want to drive .  . i will give you my car key .       . .    i think she's allergic to your lack of talent.  well, i think she's allergic to your face.    guys, this is ridiculous.  i'll say. they're terrible musicians.  take a lesson. that's it.  i've gotta talk some sense into my dad.  canned peaches. peach cobbler.  peach juice.  dad, you've got a problem.  you're telling me.  since i told your mom i like peaches, she keeps making me peach desserts i don't want.  between you and me, i think she's gone insane.  no, dad. that's you.  you're in love with a dog, and only dogs are supposed to be in love with other dogs.  i see where you're going with this, timmy.  you make a valid point.  clearly, i need to dress like a dog.  woof, woof, peaches.  it's me, the mani mean dog of your dreams.  come here, you mangy mutt.  you're going to the pound.  well, that didn't go the way i wanted it to, but at least my dad's out of the way.  timmy, they're taking your dad to the pound.  aren't you worried.  nah, they'll eventually figure out he's a guy in a dog suit and let him go.  either that or they'll put a tracking chip in him and give him his shots.  now, let's get peaches to fall for sparky.  then when my dad finds out, he'll come to his senses and fall out of love with her.  we just have to get peaches to see something in sparky that she really likes.  i know where you're going with this, wanda.  clearly, we need to cover sparky in bees and poop.  i've got a better idea.  timmy, why exactly am i wearing this suit made of meat.  dogs love meat, and peaches is a dog.  so if you wear this, you're bound to attract peaches.  so if i wear a suit of peaches, would i attract meat.  okay, i realize that was a stupid question.  you can tell by the stupid question marks floating over my head.  well, timmy, if you think this is gonna work, i'll give it a try.  trust me, sparky.  she'll be all over you.    well, voodoo was all over him.  boy, timmy, you really can be stupid sometimes.  now, if you'll excuse me, i'm gonna put on a peach vest, so i can attract a meat loaf.  ah. bees.  ow, my peach fuzz.  beat it, nut job.  well, at least i got my shots.   hey, sparky.  this has gotten out of hand.  i just got eaten by a wolf.  cry me a river.  while i was at the pound, some weird family " maybe we should just stop fighting and let peaches decide who she wants to be with, although i'm pretty sure it's me.    heel, guys, peaches has already picked her boyfriend, and it's neither of you.  well, that figures.  they always go for the bad boys.  what was i even thinking falling in love with a dog.  i must have been delusional and insane, which are numbers 18 and 304 on your mother's list.   boodles. come home.  get away from me, weirdos.   you okay, sparky. yeah.  turns out voodoo has a sister.  she's beautiful and gentle.   well, she's beautiful.  both: . and so ends the story of peaches .  . when we sing, it sounds more like screeches .  i'll say. take a lesson.          cinnamon toast crunch.  part of this good breakfast.  crave those crazy squares.    in the nation...  the safestfeature in your car is you.  add vanishing deductible fromnationwide insurance and get $100 off forevery year of safe driving.  which for

like you're suffocating me.  no, that's the water we're drowning in.   i feel you, timmy.  wanda kept nagging me all night to stop yelling into a megaphone.  poof and i couldn't sleep.  well, it relaxes me.   oh, timmy.  look. i caught a skate fish.  grill this baby up, and we've got ourselves a little piece of heaven.  honey, could you please take out the trash.  nag, nag, nag.  this morning, the living room was on fire.  and just because i was next to the phone, your mother wanted me to call the fire department.  the woman is impossible.  man meeting in the living room.  all right, timmy. listen up.  we've gotta do something.  your mother's nagging is relentless.  it caused me to lose my hare.  no, wait. here he is.  nag, nag, nag.  i'm so stressed out.  timmy, who's the loud floating guy.  this is cosmo.  he's from a town where there's more, uh, gravity.  so over here, he, you know, floats.  that does not make sense.  i'd question you, but i don't want to be a nag
