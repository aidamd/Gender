my head rolled a strike at the dimmsdale beef and bowl, and second, i'm hot on the trail of fairies.   pain.  welcome back tocrock talk.  how's it going, mother.  i have a crazy middleaged son with a stupid internet show.  how do you think it's going.  i'm gonna smear you with meat and put a leopard in your room.  anyway, i'm always looking for more footage, so if anyone sees a monster, and by anyone, i mean turner's dad, give me a call.   yay, another monster.  what are the odds of that.   run, mother.  there's a giant cricket in the room.  that's the phone, denzel.  weird.  you're live oncrock talk.  crock talk, why are there so many monsters in my house, and why do they all want my baloney.  my head rolled a strike at the beef and bowl.  i don't have to talk to you.  i've got fairies to film.  turner's still not here.  that explains why he never turns in his homework.  no problem.  i'll hide in his closet till he comes back with his fairies.    puncture wound. that'll be infected.  gah.  well, it's not like i didn't see that coming.  well, back to the lanes with my new screaming bowling ball.  mother, i had a terrible evening.  despite bowling the evertricky 710 split, i didn't get the fairy footage.  i still feel like a failure.  well, i had a swell evening.  i'm marrying olaf and taking him to niagara falls against his will.  there's never a swat team when you need one.   i know it's the phone this time.  hello. gah.  someone put coffee in the phone.  hello.  this is doug dimmadome.  doug dimmadome.  doug dimmadome, on my dimmaphone.  son, your webcast is the biggest thing to hit the internet since the show about the missing swedish professor.  people love watching you get the stuffing beat out of you by monsters and watching your head roll the evertricky 710 split.  bottom line, i want to buy crock talkfor $10 million.  phphphhp.  aaugh.  you're kidding.   i'm not kidding.  i'm a big fan with a big contract.  l you got to do is find a monster every week to beat you senseless.  you got it, freaky cowboy.  honestly, denzel, how are you going to get a monster on that show every week.  you'll never pull it off.  oh, baloney, mother.  don't take that tone with me.  no, i mean i'm going to use baloney.  apparently, monsters just love this stuff.  i'm gonna be a star.  by the way, i'm not calling you daddy.  live from downtown dimmsdale, it'scrock talk.   welcome, everyone.  who wants to see some monsters beat me silly.  i love you, mr. crock talk.  now, just let me slip into my baloney jumpsuit.  okay, monsters, who wants a piece of me.   ooh, that area's offlimits.  gah. ooh. eeh.  egah.  i love show business.  there are your monsters, sport, and they're beating up mr. crocker.  maybe we should poof them away.  just give him a few more seconds.  watch the cold cuts.   help. stop.  i blame mother.   ah, timmy, i think mr. crocker's had enough.  ah, okay.  i'll give him a break.  poof.  my monsters are gone.    you're canceled, son.  no monsters means no show, and no show means no $10 million.  no.   son, looks like you're dimmadone.  wait.  hup, ow.  man, i wish this place was carpeted.  the monsters were never seen in dimmsdale again.  however, timmy turner still plays a weekly card game with the swamp creature.  mother and professor gundersson honeymooned at niagara falls before he was rescued by a swedish swat team.  timmy's dad wisely gave up eating baloney sandwiches in favor of salami, unaware that this is the lunch meat of choice for werewolves.  crocker's head won first place at the national bowling championship, and thus ends another episode ofcrock talk.   ooh, we have a caller.  hello.  gah.  who put coffee in the phone.           malfunction.   seize the day with one hand, squeeze the pouch with the other.  capri sun roarin' waters.  seize the pouch.  cool party.  smoothies.  ...  they've been burstified. huh.  you know from the danimaliciousburst of flavor.  .  what. burstified.  pogo stick burstified.  juggling burstified.  intense party.  tell me about it.  .  and now, just in time for halloween, try orange scream danimals smoothie.  terrifyingly tasty.  . timmy is an average kid . )
