 aah.  yeech, no.  don't go to the dinklebergs. please.  their childlessness wi be our downfall.  we're losing the audience to the dinklebergs.  these people want a real magician and i'm going to give 'em one.  but crocker's here.   we'll be exposed.  what if i wore a disguise.  oh, please, timmy.  you know that never works.  secret identities arewho are you and what have you done with timmy.  now let's make my parents less lame.  ladies and gentlemen, put your barren hands together for the magic of the masked magician.  i can't believe timmy's going to miss this.  and for my first trick, alakai wish the audience was back here.  hey, come back.  these readings are off the scale, and they seem to be coming from that childsized, bucktoothed, mystery magician in timmy turner's front yard.  and for my next trick, i'll need a volunteer.  like you, person i've never met before.  that fool.  it's my chance to observe him up close.     he's stupendous.  aah.  he's amazing.   aah.   he's going to pay for ruining my dream.  hey, check it out.  some masked magician is doing some amazing tricks next door.   all right, i'm britney britney.  i was 4 times celebrity search winner when i was still a fetus.  i can get them back.  turn up the laser.  let's kick it.  pilot: oh, my eyes.  tour's over. going to vegas.   oh, masked magician, whoever you are, do something.  alakai wish the plane would stop.  aah.  that masked magician saved us.  he's no magician. he's a superhero.  a cute superhero.  cosmo, stop spinning the newspapers.  i'm trying to read.  oh, let me help.  wow. they're calling timmy a superhero.  you think he'll let all this attention go to his head.  ok, magical partners in crimefighting.  it's time to fight for truth, justice, and if we see francis, payback.  uh, i'm going to take that as a yes.  boy: help. help, help. help.  a tornado.  and i live in a trailer park.  oh, they told me this would happen, but i didn't believe them.  alakai wish the tornado was gone.  woman: help.  help, help.  somebody stole my purse.   alakai wish i caught the thief.   thank you, but where's my purse.  is it right here.  help. heeelp.  masked magician, i knew you'd come to help me.  who did this to you.  i didn't see.  i don't have any enemies, except maybe my sister tootie or my thirdgrade gym teacher or my old scout troop or my exboyfriend ricky.  alakai wish vicky was safe.  or my parents or chip skylark or my yoga instructor.  then there's that mark kid from europe and crimson chin: i think it's chintastic that you're moving up from sidekick to superhero, cleft.  that's the masked magician.  really. 'cause that's a dumb name.  but fulltime superheroing is not all fun and games.  can i get more oyster crackers, please.  there will come a day when a supervillain will arrive and try and destroy you, and the cruel irony is that it will have been you, cleft.  that's the masked magician.  i just can't get used to that.  but it will have been you that will have created that villain in the first place.   take this clown, for example.  the bronze knee cap.  he wasn't always a diabolical kneethemed villain.  he used to be ron hambone, the thirdbest jai alai player on the south shore.  i'd entered a chincinnati celebrity jai alai tournament.  hambone needed just one point to win his first firstplace trophy, not thirdplace bronze but firstplace gold, when he tripped over my rather impressive chin.  whoooaaa.  bronze knee cap: i vowed that i would end the chin's career, like he ended mine, ..  and became the bronze knee cap.   but it was an accident.  why didn't you just move on.  oh, uh, well, because he never even said he was sorry.  ..  that you're still conscious.  what. no tip.  here's a tip. always bet on justice.  you shall all pay.  the crimson chinis right, timmy.  being a fulltimesuperhero is a dangerous job.  yeah, but my situation is totally different.  it's not like i've created my own archenemy.  man: well, well, masked magician.  you think you get to ruin my dream.  ..  the handkerchief.   and now i will use this, the world's biggest chiffon handkerchief, to make dimmsdale disappear.      aah.  somebody save us.  look. up in the sky.  it's a bird.  and look down there. it's a bug.  ooh. and over there's a squirrel.  no, it's the masked magician.  mr. bickles. is that you.  you figured out my secret identity and you can fly now.  oh, that's perfect. just perfect.  what's with the big hankie.  i'm going to make dimmsdale, the town that shunned me and embraced you, disappear.  wait.  nothing you can do can stop me.  i just wanted to say i'm sorry.  prepare for a suffocation by a giant, outdated, cloth nose rag.  what. what did you say.  i'm sorry. i wasn't trying to ruin your dream.  i was just trying to help those childaddled turners.  really. gee, this is kind of unprecedented.  my new dream was to wipe out you and the city in one handkerchiefthemed death trap.  i'll cut you a deal.  i'll quit being a superhero if you quit being a supervillain.  throw in those white boots and a stage show in las vegas and you've got yourself a deal, mister.    wow.  dreams really do come true.   thank you for these great tickets, timmy.  well, i know the star.  ooh, having a child is great, for once.  well, timmy, i guess you learned to leave your superheroing in the comic books from now on.  yup, and i also learned that sometimes "i'm sorry" can be the only magic words you need.  bickles this cool show.  aah. oh, that's easy.  ..  beat it, loser.  cosmo: and we supplied the magic.  well, i'm sure britney britney's ok with it.  yeah, i'll bet she has no plans to take revenge on bickles at all.  ..  you might have ended my las vegas career, ..  by the platinum princess.  my dream ruined.  oh, well, guess i'll go back to teaching.  aah.  cosmo, knock it off.  we are the saunders.  and we're newto the pacific northwest.  the rain, the mud babam. it's there.  the outside comes in.  it's kinda nasty so you start the towelmop shuffle.  .   oh, wow, it's a swiffer wetjet.  this puts my towel mopping to shame.  whoa.  ewww.  sunshine is overrated, now we can get messy.   cosmo: timmy, are you asleep.    aah.  we have great news.  there's no encore.  we've finally been invited to a party at cupid's.  and i care about this why.  because cupid's parties are legendary in fairy world.  everybody who's anybody gets invited.  yeah, but apparently somebody who's anybody said no, because we got invited anyway.  come on.   ok, this is the fluffiest house i've ever been in.  it made the cover of "gnome & gardens" last month.  cupid: friends, fairies, godkids.  welcome.  this year, my party is a magical mystery scavenger hunt through time and space.  you have all been chosen due to your skills, abilities, fashion sense, and imaginations.  the godparent and godchild team who brings me the most items on the list wins 30 seconds of rulefree wishes.  the biggest egg ever laid.  container 079b. ha.  with you guys on my side, this is going to be a snap.  we're the best team ever.  man: don't be so sure, turner.  timmy:  remy bucksaplenty.  you got invited, too.  yes, for i, juandissimo magnifico, can always be found where the beautiful fairies float.  ah, wanda.  you are as beautiful as your husband is wimpy.   arrgh.  turner, i know we've had our differences, but i wanted to wish you the best of luck.  uh, thanks, remy.  with the rest of your loser life.  because after i win this contest, i'm going to use those rulefree wishes to get rid of your godparents. ha.  ha. he wishes.  you and remy will never be able to outscavenger hunt me, wanda, and timmy.  so sure of yourself, are you.  perhaps a bet, for the beautiful hand of your beautiful wife.   i would never risk wanda's love for something as worthless as a bet.  and this shiny nickel.  ah. so shiny. so worth 5 cents. you're on.  boys, girls, and godparents, start your time scooters.   juandissimo, my time limo, please.  on your mark, get set, go.  i wish all the other contestants were asleep.   whoohoohoohoo.  hey, dude, what's up.  good thing i wished up this antimagic bubble.  to the scavenger hunt.   follow that urchin.    hmm. the dinosaur age.  interesting first stop, timmy.  well, the first thing on cupid's list is the biggest egg that's ever been laid.  the metric system.  dinosaur egg.  ha. this is going to be a snap.    please be a plant eater.  please be a plant eater.  please be a wanda eater.  please be a wanda eater.  i wish this egg was at cupid's fluffy house.   ok, now we need container 079b from the 1971 apollo 15 mission to the moon.  how did you know that.  i copied it off a.j.'s test once.  it was the only question i got right.  zero gravity rocks.  take that, remy bucksaplenty.  bucksaplenty: don't mind if i do.  ha ha ha.  and i will take muy, muy, mucho care of wanda.  guys, come on.  ..  the world's largest banana.  let's go.   how are we supposed to get it away from him.  are you kidding. it's 1933.  with this amazing wood and steel technology, nothing can stop us.  don't worry your silly little, soontobefairyless head about that.  this looks like a job for the magic of money.  i don't know what kind of girl you think i am, but i don't hang around with just any monkey.  but suddenly, that's not just any monkey.  sure, i'll apesit your pal for you.  so, what do you want to do.  see a movie. have some dinner.  hey, easy on the hips.  i just paid for those.  aah. i don't do my own stunts.  remind me to put a stop on that check.  i will see you soon, my darling.  rats. remy's beating me.  we've got to get to 15thcentury ireland.  remember, leprechauns hate to lose their pot of gold.  here you go, laddie.  a pot of irish gold.  wow, that was easy.  'tis the least i can do for poor cosmo here.  sorry to hear about you two.  what are you talking about.  you don't know.well, then.  they say that old cosmo was dense, for betting his wife for 5 cents, if she knows, she'll be mad, if she's gone, he'll be sad, i'm betting the pain is intense.  you bet me for a nickel.  but it was a shiny nickel.  we don't have time for this.  to 18th century france.  cosmo: i can't believe we're in napoleon's house.  i can't believe you bet me for a nickel.  you haven't held me this long since we got married.  monsieur napoleon, you may, how you say, take a break.  a danish.  you know, i always wondered what he had under there.   sacre bleu. my pastry, she is gone.  we must invade denmark and obtain a fresh one.   oh, no.  remy has 3 things and there's only one thing left.  then we have to get the last item.  if we tie, we might not have won, but we don't lose either, right.  remy can't win, timmy.  he just can't.  i love that nickel. i mean, wanda.  please, you can't lose.  and we won't.  to ancient peru.  you guys, look.  remy and his richboy time limo beat us here.  we got to get in there and find the grande treasure of the peruvian pyramid before remy does.  which one is the grande treasure of the peruvian pyramid.  juandissimo: it could be any of them, so let us take them all.   i look forward to standing atop a wedding cake with you.  oh, that's weird.  that i'm not strangling cosmo right now.  well, yes, that, and the fact that in every movie i've seen with ancient pyramids and treasures, as soon as you steal the stuff, a bunch of booby traps go off.  well, i'm a boob, and wanda trapped me into marriage.  does that mean anything.  no, but i'll tell you what it does mean.  they didn't get the real treasure after all.   yay. booby trap. we found the real treasure.  i mean, oh, no. booby traps.  run.  you know, we could've just poofed out.  oh, yeah.  oh, no. we're too late.  turner, just in time to see me give cupid the final item on the list, the grande treasure of the peruvian pyramid.  would you mind naming our children after me.  i'll take my rulefree wishes now.  shiny like a nickel, but not what i wanted.  what.  actually, i think he wants this.  100% pure peruvian coffee beans. yay.  and here's a dinosaur egg  and a pot of irish gold.  but i got the moon container full of orange astro drink, the banana, and the danish.  that means we're tied.  so who wins.  i did, and with this irish gold.  potatoes.  to make golden hash browns.  i'm going to make the best hash brown, dinosaur omelet, banana, coffee, and orange astro drink brunch ever.  was this a scavenger hunt, or did we just do your grocery shopping.  oh, a little of both.  mostly the shopping part.  you don't expect me to do my own shopping, do you, silly.  truce.  truce.  get him. get him.  good thing i'm wearing a diaper.  you are all off my list.  care for an omelet, remy, old buddy.  indubitably, timmy, old bean.  care for a glass of astro drink.  don't mind if i do.  so nobody won and nobody lost, which means i'm not in trouble, right.  let me answer that with a limerick.  two fairies got a thought in their head that a bet could decide who i'd wed, while they battled their bout, their big secret got out, and now both of those morons are dead.  that's us. truce.  a very sexy truce.  both: run.  a nickel. mine.  it was worth it.  cupid: silly.  awesome.  to support team cocoa i made this.  shows how extreme cocoa pebbles taste.  the cocoariffic part of a complete breakfast.  i'm okay.  you can show your love for pebbles here.  with permission.  go team fruity.  sisters.  .  you can pump up the power.  with a highperformance hot wheels car, and the goodness of newgogurt strawberry yogurt.  one of the fun choices inyour mcdonald's happy meal.  cky.w p.charms.   and hseshoes over a 2 blue moons.  hour glaes, pzrainbows, an00sty red balloons.  py04ey're magically...  @qprlico09.   :ckcharms cereal. parof a od breakfast.  @qwhat'szhat.  so now you're ninja.  yo0sre not a ninx0@ . iluxyxyx8) @q vessi0r@ pw rw gogurt ni uturtles tubechilrrs you can 0il in oproofs of puxq pse tt one.  pw b fruitsnackia.  @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ . timmy is an average kid .  . that no one understands .  . mom and dad and vicky always giving him commands .  bed, twerp.  . the doom and gloom up in his room .  . is broken instantly .  . by his magic little fish who grant his every wish .  .
