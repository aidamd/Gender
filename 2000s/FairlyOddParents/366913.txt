kids might not enjoy spending the summer at camp learnatorium, " i'll bet the kids will have a great time.  and if they don't, who cares.  yippee. yippee.  yay. yay.  have a nice summer.  how am i supposed to pee in this.  everything looks safe and sound.  i'll get the padded encyclopedias.  i'll get the broccoli and the funnel.  i can't take spending a whole summer here.  i've only been here 5 minutes, and i'm ready to pull my hair out.  well, don't give it to me.  i'll just cough it back up.  blech.  aah. pixies.  what do you cone domes want.  it's already boring enough around here.  blech.  oh, hi, turner. don't mind us.  we're just enjoying the show.  your misery is like going to the movies for us.  want some popcorn.  it's unsalted and unbuttered, right.  and unpopped.  you know, turner, all of your misery has one common denominator: adults.  wait a minute.  what do you mean, adults.  :  who shuts the mall down early.     who gets all mad and surly      who do we have to hide from from dimmsdale    they're taking away our summer    adults ruin everything    adults ruin everything    with all their rules and laws    adults ruin everything    we must fight back because    adults ruin everything    time and time again    adults ruin everything     i'd feed the whole world ice cream.  i'd supersize the mall.  i'd melt stuff with my heat beam.  too bad it's not your call.   but i've got two magic fairies    wands waiting to be twirled    adults can't ruin everything if us kids ran the world    adults ruin everything    but kids would run things right    adults ruin everything    but we know we can fight    adults ruin everything    that's how this day unfurled    but that won't happen if i wish    that kids could rule the world    adults ruin everything    but kids would run things right    adults ruin everything    but we know we can fight    adults ruin everything    that's how this day unfurled    but that won't happen if i wish    that kids would rule the world    who gets to set the curfew.  kids.     there's one adult left we all trust    and his name is santa claus.  kids.   who gets to run the country.  kids.         adults ruin everything, and now it's kids who rule     heads down.  this is scary.  kids are ruling the earth.  hold me.  but i don't like you like that.  but i need to be held.  no. she doesn't like you like that.  phase two is complete, h.p.  it's almost as though we're finally unstoppable, sanderson.  how is that possible.  must i break it down for you.  yes. break it down.  it would be criminal if you didn't.   yeah    we're pixies    yeah    we're pixies    we're pixies    check out our mad, wicked mixies    we got square heads, big pointy caps    clean out your ears and hear my rap   .  . yo

those fairies can bite my bun   , we want to be    the bigtime rulers    you got that, chief    we're pixies, we're pixies    and since the 1960s    we've raised that clown to be our tool    to beat the fairies so we can rule    we're pixies, we're pixies    it's going just as we predictsies    we can't stop now, the time is near    where fairy world and this world here    are ruled by us      by

yvette ubetcha with the news.  this fall is all about chocolate, and homework is officially declared super yucky.  which means i guess it's time for me to go to work.   where do i work.  the white house.  wait a minute.  i'm the presidentof kidworld.  well, everywhere but florida.  they're still voting.  don't get too cocky, timmy.  being the president is a big job.  big job, schmig job. i'm

you're in charge.  i'm in charge.   that kids had no power i had to correct    we kids are the boss now, and you can expect    that things will be different with me at the wheel    i'm 10 and in charge now, and here's what i feel    i made a place that the kids are now running    the view from our tree house is really quite stunning    our plan, look, it's working    we're really quite cunning    to jorgen von strangle we go  nice hat.   it's candy for breakfast and ice cream for lunch    it's candy for dinner, and i've got a hunch    that it's dandy we run things, don't act like a mob    there's plenty to do, and we've all got a job    you get to be the police chief     all right.   you go to the learnatorium    and break everything in sight  at last.   you get to lead my armies all over the map    you clean my room, and you wash my clothes    while i stay here and nap    we're pixies, we're pixies    check out our mad, wicked mixies      we know you didn't plan it    but the kids have the powerand the fairies    we're pixies, we're pixies    and we're about to affix these    notice of eviction   this is my jurisdiction.   our ballot needs afixin'    like a magical prediction    we're pixies, we're pixies    and if you open the rules, see    in section f, subsection o      if pixies, yes, pixies    are the last magic creatures on earth, g    when the kids have too much power    and the fairies get retired    then we pixies can grant wishes    and make the whole world what we desire    everything's going tremendous    i finally have the reins    trixie's bringing me pizza    and crocker is in chains    mom and dad have homework    and vicky babysits    i make the rules, and i call the shots    you know, i must admit    how things are running quite smoothly    with kids, there are no wars    yeah, but i don't think it's groovy    that we're stuck with all the chores      this gets better by the hour    no worries, no strife, maybe this is the life   you have too much power.  uhoh.  aha.  oof.  weee.  slurp. mmmmmm.  cinnamon. milk. cinnamilk.  cinnamon toast crunch.  part of this good breakfast slurp.  cinnamilk.  .  this is mixed up.  mix

brighten your day with the goodness of apples and milk.  part of your mcdonald's happy meal.     cosmo: let us go. timmy needs us.  no, he does not. nor does any other child.  according to da rules, fairies can only be assigned to children in need.  but there are extenuating circumstances.  i know this is probably a bad time, but what does "extenuating" mean.  oh, i am sorry. here is what it means.  i'd rather learn by phonics.  i know you're upset, and also on fire, but let me explain something to you.    with my muscles i will tussles    with all those who dare discusses    a clear and present crisis    to my authority    with my knuckles you will buckles    like a chicken you will cluckses    for i so do love da ruleses, and i know da rules love me    you will learn to fear my

world where kids all ruled    with my biceps i must tryceps    to see the kids are now deniedceps    the magic we'll supplyceps    for your jobs must be retooled    oh, i love to get to draw the line    and you morons make me all the time    for da rules are very clear    und now the time is here    for me topull back the fairies    pull 'em back, pull 'em back, pull 'em back    bring them all home one by one    pull back the fairies    pull 'em back, pull 'em back, pull 'em back    now that my mocha is done    pull back the fairies    pull 'em back, pull 'em back, pull 'em back    now that the kids have the reins    now we're pulling, pulling, pulling back the fairies    so i can bring them pain   ugh. ugh.  oh, no. we're in a fairy dungeon.  well, nothing left to do now except some pullups.  ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh. whoo.  now what do you want to do.  ok, cosmo and wanda might be gone, but everything's great.  after all,i'm the president.  and i get all these free pens.   you.  that's right, president turner.  ah, circus peanuts.  that's right. it's me.  did you really think you'd be able to get away with sending your kid armies to destroy camp learnatorium.  yeah. that's why we tore it down.  and here's a commemorative pen from the bill i signed endorsing the action.  hey, thanks. iooh, darn it.  that place was great.  dude, that place was lame.   it can't be lame.  everything i knew about fun went into that place.    oh, confetti.  sorry about that.  no. that was fun.  you should do more stuff like that.  i was taught that boring was fun, that dull was fun.  who would tell you that dull and boring was fun.  hello, son.   what the heck is going on here.  montage, please.   : since the days we found him in the untamed wilds of kansas, we have been secretly watching over flappy bob.  ..   ..  ugh.  we always delivered our special brand of caregiving to see that flappy was taken care of.  even if he didn't know how.  ah.  we made sure he had everything he needed to live ouri mean, his dream.  learnatorium.  a 37yearlong dream you destroyed, turner.  yeah, he did destroy my dream.  so, who are you, anyway.  longlost cousins. distant uncles. what.  and what's with the floating.  we have that kind of money.  walking is for poor people.  we like to think of ourselves as your godparents.  godparents. oh, no.  that means they can grant a wish.  godparents with the money to give you anything you want if you just sign here.  as part of the contract, you get to make the world exactly the way you want to, and all we want in return are certain merchandising rights, a few royalties, and absolute control of fairy world.  oh, my gosh.  i know what they're up to.  no. you have to listen to me.  i know they're the guys who've given you everything you've ever wanted, and i'm just the guy who destroyed your lifelong dream, bulisten to me.  boy, that came out wrong.  but i gave you the pen.  forget it, kid.  i know who my friends are, and i'm signing that contract.  wait.   flappy bob, can't you see what they've    they needed a pawn, and clearly you were the one    they took away your clowny clothes    your floppy shoes and big red nose    just look around      since you were born, they decided your fate    from the style of your car down to the food that you ate    i know it seems they gave a lot    but i'm telling you it's part of a plot    a plot that you can stop    stop it before it's too late   h.p. and sanderson:  hey, flappy bob      the lies that he's been telling    i know where this is heading    towards turning you against us    to resent us   and present us    and suggest   who are the villains.     yeah, don't you be forgetting    it was you, flappy bob    yeah, you were the one    we protected   and respected    as though you were our son    and now you're in the middle    you can fiddle with this riddle    or you can sign this deal and trust us    that your wishes will be done              the one i can trust to tell me what's fun         he was the one    you were the one who wanted to shun    everything i always thought fun     hey, flappy bob, can't you see in your    there's a role you play    and, dude, this just ain't the right part    i know my actions weren't ideal    but how do your clowny parents feel    about the path you chose, whether or not            who is the one    the one i can trust to tell me what's fun      i'm so conflicted    but he was the one    the one who restricted    your vision of fun    and with this pen i'll sign by line item 1   no.   maybe you're right, could be a giant mistake     but changing my life's a risk i'm not ready to take    this nose, pants, hair, and shoes    they're all my past, and now i choose    to wish for a world    a world that fits all my views    a world where i'm safe   it's over, turner. you lose.   thanks for the pen.  aah.  oh, no.   i'm happy peppy dad    i'm happy peppy mom   no.  jorgen: don't make this any more painful than it has to be.  isn't there supposed to be a good cop and a bad cop.  we had some cutbacks.  now, do you want to stay in fairy jail for the rest of your fairy life, or do you want to blame cosmo.  no.  please.  no.  ok. good cop over. blame cosmo.  blame cosmo.   i was lost till he found me    and although he confounds me    by his crown is where i know i should be   aah.   yes, i know he's a moron    with a brain made of boron    and yet i'm drawn to him magically    and through every moment of turmoil    and moment of pain    through all of our misadventures    one thing remains    facing pixies, bullies, and jarheads    i'll never be blue    as long as i'm floating with you   cosmo:  i saw her and no other    i still lived with my mother    when i spotted her swirly pink hair    though my shoes smell like tar pits    and i don't wash my armpits    i like monkeys too much, but i know she doesn't care    and i know that i'm forgetful    i know i'm dim    and even though i've just eaten    i know i'll swim    i knowthat it doesn't matter    if i can't count to 2    as long as i'm floating with you   together:  even though we're in deep here    and they might make us sleep here    here with you, dear    is where we both make our stand    i am braced for attack and    knowing she has my back end    all i need is her hand in my hand    baby, i know i can be nagging    i know you're naggy, too    i know that i'm demanding      but one thing i'm understanding    no matter what we go through    i'd rather go through it    i know i'll get through it    if i'm floating through it with you   you really are kind of naggy.  did you get the handcuff key.  operation distract jorgen with a stupid gooey love song works every time.   ..  oh, and that part with the fingerprints.  fingers aren't shaped like that.  that is love.   come on. we've got to get down to earth.  , now that flappy has given us total control over fairy world, what do you want to do with it.  i'm thinking dull and gray.  i was thinking gray and dull, but that's why you're the boss.    ..  aah, pixie magic.  it's sucking away all the fun.  oh, we're never gonna make it.  there's still enough pretty color left for one of us to slide down the rainbow bridge.  wow. there wasn't a manly word in that sentence.  we need a magic wand.  oh, no. pixie magic.   i still have my wand. maybe i can stop this.  aah. no.  aah.  oh, cosmo.  go.  aah.  wanda.  cosmo.  whee.  cosmo.  cosmo.  i am not naggy.  cuckoo court now in session.  your honor, you've gotta keep cocoa puffs away from me.  ..but why.  .. and they make me go cuckoo.  ..crunchy...  ..cocoa puffs.  chocolate in the court.  see, i'm cuckoo for cocoa puffs, cuckoo for cocoa puffs.  cocoa puffs has the ultimate chocolatey taste that turns everything chocolatey ...even the milk. chocolatey cocoa puffs, part of a good breakfast.  i find you guilty. totally delicious.         hey there.  hi ronald.  bad day, huh.  i'll say.  well, it could be worse. ooh.  awesome.   make the gray skies go away   brighten your day with the goodness of apples and milk.  part of your mcdonald's happy meal.     this stinks.  we can't float. we can't do magic.  and this suiti can't wear gray.  i'm a fairy.  binky, no.  aah.  look at me. i'm colorful.  colorful.  aah.     this used to be a fun place    but now we wear a sad face    since pixies have all replaced the way that things are done    there's no more granting wishes    you can't turn into fishes    now pipe down, do the dishes    come on, now, everyone    these are the unfundamentals for us fairy godparentals    who are now devoid of wishing and of mirth    we're certifiably demental 'cause these unfundamentals    make being a fairy about as fun as giving birth    i'll bet it's even worse down there on earth   wanda: timmy. timmy.  timmy. timmy.  timmy.  00    the trampolines are bouncyfree    and there's a pad on every knee    everything's fine far as i see    but i can't help but think out loud    the things that kid had said somehow    my mom and dad would not be proud    of the path i've taken in life        accept these gifts i once refused    i'm happy peppy  not now.   our heads must be protected    our bodies disinfected    this is just as i suspected    what would happen if this world was ruled ..    unfundamentals, surely all you parentals    must see how devoid of fun this truly, truly is    but all these unfundamentals    seem quite instrumental    to keep all of you rowdy kids in line    if you need us, we'll be playing the back 9   well, sanderson, we've done it.  one of our 37year plans has finally given us control over all the magic.  , if this place were any less fun, it would need a librarian.   well, floppy shoes, big red nose, i guess this is goodbye.   hey, my floating rich friends.  and just think, all we had to do to beat our fairy enemies was rip a clown child away from his superhilarious destiny and convince him that fun wasn't fun and that boring was fun.  you'd have to be a clown to fall for that.  a really dumb clown.   that kid was right.  they were using me.  i'll show them who's a dumb clown.   ugh. i'm gonna have to do this by myself.  timmy. it's horrible.  pixies have taken control of fairy world.  wow, for a quarter of a second there, i thought i was in big trouble.     they're not letting us do anything fun.  i know. let's make it go away.  i wish the world was back to normal.  because of that pixie contract, there's nothing i can do to break the wish.  flappy bob:..  but with the right amount of fun, anything's possible.  flappy bob.  that's right.  flappy bob.  ha ha ha ha. clown.  i was a clown at birth, but those two rich guys raised me to be a boring businessman.  and if there's one thing boring businessmen know, it's how to find a loophole.  oh. oh, that's good.  you get those cone domes down here, and i'll do the rest.  and there's only one way to do that.  let's get fun.  i like fun.  i'm all about the fun now.  ha ha ha ha.   hey, flappy bob,can't you see what they've    it might reek now, but it can all be undone    so grab your kites and water guns   my bike. my clone.  this big sticky bun.   it's not a crime    to have your time in the sun    kids just being kids    acting up and eating dirt    kids just being kids    they could all get hurt    kids just being kids    can keep those goons off all our butts    we'll get this town out of its rut    by us kids just being kids    yo, we're pixies, we're pixies      the time has come, the deal's gone through   stay there    we'll come to you    we're pixies, we're pixies   . thiis how we get our kicksees    our plan has worked, and they have lost    let's ping on down to show who's the boss    the pixies, the pixies    the pixies    you two shout real loudly    it's your turn now to roar    you get to parade proudly with this drum and bugle corps    you find the kids and wow them    i'll
