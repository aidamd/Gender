but these chains are crushing my lungs.  sorry, chip.  oh, that's all right, little pal.  it's not like you wished for this to happen.  i thought chip would be a big jerk because he's a big star.  but he's not such a bad guy after all.  i wish chip was free and out of vicky's clutches.   oh, great. the wandnotworking  noise.  what's wrong.  well, you know how the rules say we can't use our magic to

icky vicky    icky    vicky   i was totally wrong about you, chip.  just because you're rich and famous doesn't mean you're a jerk.  actually, i'm not all that rich.  the record company pays for everything.  i'm broke, but if the fans knew that, they might not love me anymore.  but neither would vicky.  well, there's that.  she wouldn't love you anymore.  hi, chip, darling.  look who i found on the internet.  the only justice of the peace on earth who will marry someone against their will.  when vicky finds out that chip's not rich, she won't love him anymore.  timmy: yeah, but how do we let vicky know.  we are gathered here today to forcibly bond these two teens against their will.  is there anyone here besides the groom who has a reason these two should not be wed.  he does.  it's the guy from the record company.  thanks for the tip, pinkhead mystery woman.  i represent chip's record company.  since you're going to be chip skylark's wife, you get chip skylark's debts.  and this is for the car, this is his cell bill.  ..  well, everything else.  .  but, chip, i thought you were rich.  nope. he's just pretty and talented.  noooo. you broke, loser creep.  i don't love you.

skate the big ramp.  aren't ya scared.  a little, but with you guys helping me, i've got nothing to worry about.  both:..  " ..  ..  according to the rules, we can't help you win a contest, timmy, that'd be cheating.  we can help you show off, but for fun, not profit.  i'd never have challenged vicky if i'd had known that.  all the kids are counting on me.  i still have a shot though, right.  actually, you're pretty uncoordinated.  i am not. uhh.  i'm doomed.  what you need is some deathdefying trick all your own.  timmy, what you need is some deathdefying trick all your own.  you need this.  it combines a 1400 degree turn with four aerial flips.  i call it the 1400 degree in four aerial flippy trick.  yeah, that rolls off the tongue, poindexter.  what about calling it the timmy tuck.   oh, darn it.  call it impossible. i can't do this.  vicky: but i can.  i can't wait to totally steal that trick and make it mine.   it's good to be queen.   he's not very good, is he.  nope, but this garbage rocks.   sorry.  i'll never get good enough in time to do that trick.  i know you guys can't help me cheat, but can't you train me.  you know, take me someplace where i can get real good real fast.  whoohoo.  zero gravity is perfect for practicing spins.  houston, we have another problem, over.  it's always problem, problem, problem with you guys.  don't you ever call just to say hi. over.  skating in the jungle is a great way to learn how to swerve.  learn to skate in difficult environments, you must, because scared of gorillas am i.  ramping down a pyramid is a great way to learn how to pick up speed.  aaaaah.  heavens. this specimen is perfectly preserved.  am i. i'm still using this.  uh. the mummy's cursed.  i'm still beefing it on the simplest of tricks.  don't worry, timmy.  when or lose, your friends will still love you.  really.  timmy better win or we're not gonna love him anymore.  welcome to the skate park at the big skateboarding contest.  today's the big match between evil 16yearold ..   and timmy.   wait. where is timmy.   ha ha. i knew it.  i knew he'd punk out.  i win by default.  and you know what that means.  where could he be.  if i go down there, i'm gonna lose and have to go on the big ramp.  there's no way i'm gonna humiliate myself.  no way.  all right, twerps. line up.  say byebye.  not so fast, vicky.  you wanna win, you're gonna have to do it the oldfashioned way.  by being better than me.  both: it's timmy.   good luck, timmy.  thanks, guys.  i'll do my best.  yeah, just remember, it's not whether you win or lose, it's win or we don't ever get to come back here again.    break a leg, twerp.  thanks, vicky.  no, really. i mean break a leg.   yeah, well, watch this.   and timmy actually wins the first round.    ha. beat that, twerp.  .. unfortunately...wins.   it all comes down to this.  the super, colossal, gigantic, freakishly large, ramp of death.  don't worry, timmy.  just do the timmy tuck, and you'll be the new queen.  king. whatever.  i, vicky, am about to do the totally original, and completely mine, trick, the vicky tuck.  . what..  she stole your trick.  oh, this calls for some dramatic background music.   aaaaah.  now all timmy has to do is survive the big ramp and he wins.  oh, no. the big ramp.  i can't do it. i won't.  timmy. timmy.  timmy. timmy.  timmy.  all right. all right.  well, it's been nice knowing me.  skating on the moon, ramping down the pyramids, skating in the jungle, i can do this. i can do this.  he can do this. he can do this.  unless.   oh, no. i'm doomed.  she's totally cheating.  ..cheating.  not if i can help it.  and now for some zerogravity spins.  look at him go.  ..  ..  andwhat's after three.  four.  right.  and that's why it's called the timmy tuck.   no way, twerp.  how can you do that when i couldn't.  because timmy's small and nice.  you're tall and weighted down with too much evil, which threw you off balance.  ha ha. well, that's super.  you'll be going now.  oh, no. i won.  i'm the queen now.  king. right.  gimme that crown.  oh, you want this crown.  you've got a better chance if some loser 12yearold wasteoid falling from the sky and plowing me into the ground.  aaaaaah.  here you go.   thank you, thank you.  and as the new queen of the skate park, ..  let my people skate.   vicky's in a crater, and the kids are free to skate.  pretty good day, don't you think.  i wanna a hot dog. is it halftime yet.  you did it, dude.  ..  thrashed vicky and saved the park.  and
