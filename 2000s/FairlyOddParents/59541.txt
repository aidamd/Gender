" sorry. you make me nervous.  also, i think i have a concussion.  what do you want, weirdo.  well, i'm a magical antifairy, and i'm here to be your scary godparent and grant your every evil wish.   you're welcome.  if you're really magic, prove it.   whoa, that's pretty cool.  oh, that wasn't me.  there's a storm coming in.  but watch this.  tada.    you've got kind of a trigger finger on that mace there.  all right. so you're my scary godparent.  and you've gotta grant all my wishes.  how do i tell you all of them.  how. how.  i'll perform an antifairy mind meld.  it will allow me to see all your evil dreams.  oh, dear, your neck is as scaly and cold as the skin of a serpent.  what did you say.  nothing, nothing.  you're a radiant angel.  mind melding now.  oh.  it's a tsunami of skulls, fire, hatred, and boy bands.   why are they always dancing in the rain.  never question boy bands or their smooth dance moves.  okay, listen.  if we're gonna work together, you're gonna have to get a better look.  so my first wish is for you to dress like my favorite boy band star ever.  no can do, sister.  i caught a glimpse of him in the mind meld and he's a little on the precious side.   well, that's the last time i defy your wishes and express wish coming up.  well, my life is over now.  don't speak unless you're spoken to.   now, let's test out this magic of yours.  who do i wanna make miserable.  i know.  that cheapskate mr. turner never paid me.  i wish he were handcuffed to his mortal enemy, mr. dinkelberg.  dinkelberg.  no.   this is a great idea, turner.  handcuffing us together is a wonderful way to build a neighborly bond.  what do you say we go hug some sad people.  uh, well, you'll have to start with me, you monster.  okay.  oh. it's my nightmare.  impressive.  now, let's take it up a notch.  i'll use your magic to make timmy turner's life and the lives of kids everywhere pure misery.    don't laugh evilly until i tell you to.  this is chet ubetcha with some bad news for kids.  weekends and summer vacations have been magically cancelled.  also, all kids must practice the tuba four hours a day or four tubas for one hour a day.  oh, come on. this can't be real.  this is totally real.  and if you don't practice, you will be attacked by a vicious beast called "the tubacabra" as seen here in this picture from timmy turner's room.  wait, what.      ah. poof it away. poof it away.   guys, what the heck is happening.  well, either a stampede of elephants is about to crush us, or every kid in dimmsdale is practicing the tuba.  ..  oh. i can't play the tuba anymore.  my lips hurt. ah.  not as much as tubacabra claws.  ahh.  anyway, timmy, it's saturday.  you should be in school.  oh, i am not going to school on saturday.  whatever's going on here, make it stop.  i want you to poof it all away.   all: yay.  this is chet ubetcha saying forget everything i just said.  kids can go have fun again.  what happened.  all my evil wishes went away.  have they.  i can't see a thing with this stupid hair in my eyes.   stupid hair that i'm very, very grateful for.  don't hurt me. all right.  let's do this again.  i wish all kids in dimmsdale were stuffed in lockers.   guys, get me outta here.  normally, weird things only happen when i wish for them.  what's going on around here.  you're asking me.  i'm still trying to figure out how hot meat dishes keep showing up in my pocket.  the only thing i can think of is somebody else is out there making wishes.  really mean wishes.  and apparently, you're not the only kid who was stuffed in a locker.   oh, no.  i wish all the lockers were gone.  guys, we've gotta figure out who's behind all this.  why do all my wishes keep being undone.  if it pleases you, your evilness, i have a theory.  spit it out.  not your gum, your theory.  and stuff yourself in a locker for putting gum in my hair.  there is someone else who has magical fairies.  and he's probably using them to unwish your wishes.   who is it.  it's...   nd star ever.  no can do, sister.  i caught a glimpse of him in the mind meld and he's a little on the precious side.   well, that's the last time i defy your wishes and express my own free will.  wish coming up.  well, my life is over now.  don't speak unless you're spoken to.   now, let's test out this magic of yours.  who do i wanna make miserable.  i know.  that cheapskate mr. turner never paid me.  i wish he were handcuffed to his mortal enemy, mr. dinkelberg.  dinkelberg.  no.   this is a great idea, turner.  handcuffing us together is a wonderful way to build a neighborly bond.  what do you say we go hug some sad people.  uh, well, you'll have to start with me, you monster.  okay.  oh. it's my nightmare.  impressive.  now, let's take it up a notch.  i'll use

for putting gum in my hair.  there is someone else who has magical fairies.  and he's probably using them to unwish your wishes.   who is it.  it's...  timmy turner, your psychoticness.  the twerp has fairies.  so that explains the funny business with the circus and how he wears a pink hat without getting beat up.  so the way to destroy timmy is to destroy his fairies.  and that's exactly what we're gonna do.   don't laugh evilly until i tell you to.  sorry.  fruitsnackia.  @@@@@@@ @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ @ so tell me, weirdo: how do i capture timmy turner's fairies.   i'm sorry.  is that a fruit bat on your shoulder.  yeah, for some reason, they nest in my room.   good grief.  what are you.  i can't take it anymore.  will you excuse me for one moment.   oh, right.  i can't defy you without being zapped by my baba.  stop messing around and tell me how to catch the twerp's fairies.  to be perfectly honest, catching fairies is not my specialty.  but i do know an expert.   come on in.  i was just pouring some lemonade.  that would be creepy.  so what can i do you for.  we need you to tell us how to catch timmy turner's fairies.  fairies. well, i'm an expert in that.  if you've define "expert" as someone who's never accomplished the one thing he set out to do.  save me.  what did you just say.  um, i meant save me a glass of lemonade.   uh, the fruit bat dipped its talons in mine.  after all, lemons are a fruit.  and he is fruit bat.  it stands to reason.  i want to go home.  do you have anything to help us catch fairies.  do i.   those are butterfly nets.  no fairy or deranged lunatic can escape them.  and that's the crocker pot.  not only does it catch fairies but it also makes a great rump roast, which happens to be the one food fairies can't resist.   perfect.  i'll take the rump roast and the crocker pot.  whoa, whoa.  if you're going fairy hunting, i'm coming with you.  you're not going anywhere.  stuff him in a locker.  oh, the downside of having dolls for friends is they can't pick a lock.  i mean, they're not mine.   any luck locating the source of the evil magic.  i haven't found any magic.  but i did find these pocket tacos.  " well, at least sparky's on the case.  good news, guys. i found the case.  that's my dadbriefcase.  there's a yoyo, a paddle ball game, and a scary, handscrawled book calledsink the dink: how i plan to destroy dinkelberg and tarnish his legacy.  that's my dad's, all right.  where is my dad, anyway.  normally, i share my box seats to the baseball game with an underprivileged child.  but since we're handcuffed together, i guess it's your lucky day.  some lucky day.  great seats, free hot dogs, and i got to throw out the first pitch.  somebody wake me from this hideous dream.   oh, great.  now, i've caught a recordbreaking home run ball worth thousands of dollars.  you despicable fiend.  sport, i've located the source of the evil magic.  ..   what is that delicious smell.  burnt pacos.  no, wait. it's rump roast.  no fairy can resist it.  ooh.  all: rump roast. rump roast.  rump roast.  soon, i'll capture the twerp's fairies.  and no one will be able to undo my evil wishes.  just out of curiosity, why isn't the rump roast thing working on you.  because i'm an antifairy.  our weakness isn't rump roast.  it's the exact opposite, which everyone knows is chicken cordon bleu.  all: rump roast. rump roast.  rump roast. ha. we did it.  we captured the twerp's fairies.  no.  vicky caught cosmo, wanda, and poof.  wait, how come the rump roast didn't work on you.  i'm a fairy dog.  everyone knows our weakness is lobster bisque.  no one knows that.  anyway, how did vicky find out i have fairies.  because i, the great and powerful foop, told her.  please save me from her.  you're through, twerp.  i want all my wishes reinstated.  but instead of putting the twerp in a locker, put him in a ballet class taught by an angry monkey with a taser.    music to my ears.  children in lockers practicing the tuba.  come on, scary godparent.  i've got some more misery to cause.  uhoh. it's up to me to save everyone.  first, i gotta get six taps on this paddle ball game.  one, two. okay, this may take a while.  can i please stop now.  no. plie.  freeze, dance monkey.     one. two.  three, four.  darn it. i can never get to six.  i'm okay. ahh.  no, not okay.  ironically, i slipped on a banana peel.  come on, sparky.  we gotta go save my fairies and stop vicky.  before we do that, can you take off the tutu.  it's unsettling.   help. let us out.  help. wanda just yelled "help" in my ear.  quiet.  i'm gonna set this crocker pot to vaporize.  in ten minutes, the twerp's fairies will be as cooked as that rump roast.   all right, weirdo.  time to ramp up the evil.  i wish ice cream tasted like sardines.  i wish all birthday parties were cancelled.  and finally, i wish there really were monsters under every kid's bed.  boy, you have issues.  just do it.   ahh.   ahh.  both: ahh.  i wish you were wearing a sandpaper diaper.   so this is how it ends.  wearing a scratchy diaper in a room full of bats.   cry, cry, weeping sounds.    something smells really good, timmy.  that's my fairies.  we've got to get them out of that crocker pot before their rumps are roasted.  but how. i got it.  what. i did six.  sparky, focus.  if we don't get thin the next five minutes, they're cooked.  come on.   oh, no. i have to practice my tuba.    we've gotta get in there and take out vicky.  an't, timmy.  vicky will use foop to destroy us.  not if we can convince foop to turn on her first.  he's spent a lot of time with vicky.  he must be ready to crack by now.    come on, sparky.  hold it, vicky.   ahh.  twerp, what are you doing here.  call off your dog.  nevermind, i'll have my scary godparent do it.  foop, destroy them.  can i take off the diaper.  no.  foop, wait.  if you help us stop vicky and let me save my fairies, i'll help you get away from her.  i can't defy vicky.  if i do, my baba gives me an owie.  use bigboy words.  i'll get my fairies to blast your baba so you can be free of vicky.  really. can i also get a snack.  she threw out my little bag of fishy cracker numnums.  don't listen to him, foop.  you'remyscary godparent.  and you'll do asisay.  and i say suffer.  mmm. something smells delicious.  that's us, cosmo.  foop, you gotta listen to me.  vicky's gonna keep treating you badly.  if you don't wanna wind up in that crocker pot someday, blast her now, and let me save wanda, cosmo, and poof.  forgthing you can say to change my mind.  what if i throw in some chicken cordon bleu.  mind changed. perish, evil shrew.   ha, ha.  you can't do it.  you're worthless. and you're mine forever.  wanna bet, bat lady.     all: yay.  thanks, sport. our goose was almost cooked.  actually, it was fully cooked.  i had a goose in my magic meat pocket.    thanks for saving my fairies, foop.  thank you for saving my behind, literally.  guys, i want you to give foop a chicken cordon bleu, a new baba, and an owiefree diaper.  timmy, use your bigboy words.  thank you. but can i get an apple juice.  grape juice doesn't go well with chicken.  bunch of tacky morons.  guys, we need to undo all of vicky's evil wishes.  all: yay. ahh.    yay. i'm traumatized.  you know, turner, i was gonna take my wife on this firstclass caribbean cruise.  but since we're handcuffed together, it's your lucky week.  how dare you shower me with luxury.  i hope you rot for this.  well, look at that. you're free to go.  oh, right, and forgo the nachos i just put on your tab.  that would play right into your grimy hand.  speaking of your grimy hand, would you mind rubbing some sun block on my back.  sure, pal.  this is the life.  i mean, curse you, dinkelberg.  foop, you have failed miserably as a scary godparent.  it appears you are not as evil as we had hoped.  , really.  i'll showyouevil.  why does this hurt so much.  because you're wearing sandpaper diapers.   oh, i'm back, baby.  it's good to be home, guys.  what do you say we go get some dinner.  no need, timmy.  my magic pockets are filled with moo goo gai pan.  whoo, that's a lot of goo and not much gai pan.  uh, yeah. let's just go out to eat.  by the way, where did you poof vicky.  oh, don't worry.  we're keeping her on her toes.  this sandpaper tutu hurts.  just keep dancing, bat lady.   you know what. i'm keeping the hair. )
