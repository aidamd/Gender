" i don't believe in fairies.  i don't believe in fairies.  i don't believe in fairies.  i don't believe in fairies.  ..believe in...fairies.  woo hoo.   woo hoo.  timmy, don't you think these wishes are a little conspicuous.  i might if i knew what that word meant.  you're cured.  now, don't come back.  crash.  crocker, i can explainno need, timothy.  normally i'd think this was the work of fairy godparents, but i don't believe in them anymore.  clearly you and your magic carpet are just racing a monkey on a unicorn.  nothing unusual here.  cured.  dr. phyllis fancyfree: therapist to the fairy impaired.  a therapist.  crocker of his belief in fairies.  you know what that means.  i'm still stuck on conspicumous.  crocker won't be hunting you guys anymore.  woo hoo.  this rocks.  woo hoo.  this rocks.  it is time for my favorite show.  welcome to another episode ofdancing with the elves.  tonight, it's hermie versus sparkle.  oh, no.  fairy world is losing power.  i bet i know who is responsible.  to turner's house.  oh, darn it.  woo hoo. yippee.  poof.  now, seriously, could someone please explain what's going on.  yes, explain it to me too, turner.  explain why the power is being drained from fairy world.  well, it's not us.  we're just celebrating mr. crocker not believing in fairies anymore.  oh. say, what now.  this is the worst possible news.  let me explain why with a very elaborate and colorful demonstration chock full of pageantry and magic.  oh, right.  um, can i have a pad and some crayons.  for centuries, we fairies have harnessed the energy that comes from the spazzing of certain humans who believe that fairies exist.  crocker first began to spaz about fairies many years ago, his energy was so powerful, we harnessed it to fuel the big giant wand all by itself.  you mean all of our magic comes from mr.  crocker.  ironic, isn't it.  so what happens now that crocker's stopped believing in fairies and won't spaz out anymore.  the loss of power has already begun.  all of fairy world will have to start rationing magic, or else we will completely lose power.  poof.  uhoh.  poof can't float.  i think he's out of power already.  either that or his diaper's full.  crocker to believe in fairies again.  the fate of fairy world hangs in the balance.   wait for me.  don't worry, guys.  we'll get fairy world's power back.  i know deep down crocker still believes in fairies.  he'll never change.     i'm footloose and fairyfree.  baby.  not for long.  crocker sees you guys doing some super cool magic, it'll snap him back to his old self, and the power will come back to fairy world.  ah.  ah.  fairy world must be running out of magic quicker than i thought.  either that or my diaper's full.  ee.  or both.  guys, get up.  you gotta float.  ow.  ow.  ah, timothy.  learning to juggle with screaming colorful stuffed animals that feel pain.  that makes perfect sense.  no fairies here.  gah.  no, mr. crocker, wait.
