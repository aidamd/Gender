  it flips your lid when you are the kid     vicky: yeah, right.  captioning made possible by nickelodeon  playing catch with myself sure is thirsty business.  so is salting your tongue, but that never stopped me.  argh.   ..  that's an awful lot of lemonade.  don't worry.  we turners have bladders of steel.  ahem.  oh, they always want a tip.    aah.  watching owls carry mice away is thirsty work.  oh, it's an invitation to our high school reunion.  aah.  ah, what invitation.  but, cosmo, our time at carl poofy pants fairy high was the best 4 years of my life.  yeah, and the worst 10 years of mine.  that's me being picked on by the football team.  by luther.  and here's me being picked on by the cheerleaders.  and luther.  and the math club. and luther.  cosmo, what are you worried about.  a high school reunion is fun.  you get to see all your old classmates you used to pal around with.  besides, it's not like they expected you to become a rich billionaire fairy mogul with a beautiful trophy wife.  a rich fairy mogul, ah, ..  cosmo.  what did you tell them.  cosmo: hello.  i'm the very rich cosmo, 0, the operating system of every magical item in fairy world.  and this is my dowdy secretary wanda. my faithful butler with big teeth and a cast iron bladder, timmy. along with my human trophy wife who is clearly not hypnotized, britney britney.  i like soy milk.  uh, where do i sign in.   and where do i go to use the bathroom.  i told you to go before we left.  no, you didn't.  you told me there is no way we're dressing up like a butler and a secretary just to cover for the lies cosmo told people, then cosmo started to cry, " and now we're here.  relax, butler.  we mingle, impress a few people with my false life, and we're done in 15 minutes tops.  uh. what. the doors are just painted on.  you don't need doors in a fairy high school.  we poof from room to room.  doors are for chumps.  i really have to go to the bathroom, but i'll be ok as long as i don't think about it.  well, this could be ok.  want some punch.  i like puppies.  go get us some, butler, and bring my trophy wife a puppy.  cosmo, is that you.  cosmo, you old son of a gun, you haven't changed a bit except for being a billionaire and everything.  ah, ha. right. hi, luther.  have you met my wife, britney britney, who has clearly not been hypnotized into thinking that i'm chip skylark and that this is the dimmsdale music awards.  right, chip.  and, of course, you remember wanda.  she's now my dowdy, unmarried secretary.  sure. i remember wanda.  too bad you didn't marry cosmo, huh.  he's a billionaire, you know.  " too bad you're already taken.  yeah. too bad.  i suppose you know why i'm here.  don't kill me. i'm rich.  can i have a job.  surely a rich guy like you could use some security.  ha ha. you bought that. oh, my gosh.  people really believe i'm super rich and super powerful.  ...  you're hired.  now get rid of my dowdy, personal secretary.  come on. move it. move it.  gaah.  and where's britney's puppy.  finally. a bathroom.  ugh.  i forgot. doors are for chumps.  ok, i just won't think about it and i'll be fine.    uhoh. i hope we don't stay long.    and then i thought, "yeah, you're dowdy, " ah.   oh, cosmo, why didn't see how handsome and cool you were in high school.  why did i beat you up everyday.  because i wasn't rich.  ha ha ha. that's right.  excuse me, cosmo, i wishto serve my friends and i more punch.  uh, yes, please, timothy.  ha. he thinks the doors are real.   oh, i don't know how much longer i can keep up this charade.  wanda, i don't mean to sound like you when you try to ruin my fun, but we should get out of here now.  lying is a bad idea, you know.  and holding it in is bad for my kidneys.  and excuse me if i sound as shortsighted as you always do when i say, "come on.  " and i also invented oxygen, which is why every time you inhale, i get a quarter.   pay up.  man: hello, cosmo.  juandissimo, what are you doing here.  you perhaps forget the one year i was here as a handsome exchange student from ferdinando high school because i will never forget.  that was the first time my beautiful eyeballs saw the fabulous wanda.  the first time my beautiful ears heard her.  and the first time my beautiful colonwell, it's more of an inner beauty, but you get the idea.  and now i and my beautiful body parts wish to dance with her.  hey, buddy, stay away from my wife.  all: wife. huh.  pay up.  cosmo, relax yourself.  i would never try to come ..  the fantastic pop diva, britney britney.  pickles.  ha.  but you cannot possibly care if i dance with your dowdy, unmarried personal secretary, no.  no. he can't.    ah. what am i gonna do.  juandissimo has wanda.  quick. let's go someplace quiet to think.  like the boy's bathroom.  i know what will help me think, a tall, cool glass of lemonade.   followed by a quick trip to the bathroom.  wait. take me with you.  ah. ah, that's better.  but going to the bathroom is thirsty work.   you have to decide right now what is more important: living a lie to impress fairweather friends or your love for wanda, the woman who's always loved you for who you really are.  hmm.  oh, my gosh. wanda wrote that.  what do i do. what do i do.  my choice is clear.  there's no doubt what i should do.  hot tub.  ..  would you like to see my diploma of love.  no way. that is it.    my beautiful colon.  wanda.   ..  cosmo: ahem.  could i have everybody's attention, please.  cosmo, our hero, the greatest of us all, has something to say that will undoubtedly only make us respect and admire him and his money more.  thanks, luther.  um, it's a funny story, actually.  you see, i'm not really rich or the inventor of wandos.  timothy isn't really my butler.  he's my fairy godchild.  and britney britney isn't my wife.  she's just a hypnotized pop diva.  kumquat.  and wanda, my dowdy, unmarried secretary, is the dowdy married woman i love and married.   pay up.  i knew it. she did marry an idiot.  oh, cosmo.  oh, dowdy.  oh, my bladder.  i can't take this anymore.  sorry, britney. we're through.  does that mean the show is over.  did i win.  i'd like to thank the academy.  and the academy would like to thank you back.  mmwah.  aww.  wait, you guys aren't mad.  mad. why would we be mad.  you had the guts to say what nobody else here did.  i have a secret, too.  i'm not luther, captain of the football team.  i don't play football anymore.  i'm luther, lord of the dance.  this isn't my real hair.  and i'm not a fairy.  i'm a leprechaun.  and he's not an owl who eats mice.  i eat leprechauns.   aahh.  you see, cosmo, everybody wants to be liked for who they really are.  i don't have to lie anymore.  whoo. what a relief.  speaking of relief, whatever you do, don't drink the punch.  cool party.  smoothies.  ...  they've been burstified. huh.  you know from the danimaliciousburst of flavor.  .  what. burstified.  pogo stick burstified.  juggling burstified.  intense party.  tell me about it.  .  and now,
