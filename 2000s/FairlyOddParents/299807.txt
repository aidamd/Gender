tree, and it's in bloom.  say, nice marmleberry tree, turner.  where will we live, woman.  .  i did so well, we can now afford to live here.  .  are you mad, woman.  no.  here, in beautiful, new, exclusive dimmadome acres.  let me see that.  ooh. they have a golf course.  let's get out of this dump.   mom: this is it, beautiful dimmadome acres.  where everyone is just like you.  dad: ooh.

yo.  it comes with a helmet and a free bottle of dimmadome farms milk.  both: if it's not from dimmadome farms, it's just milk.   i don't know, timmy.  something seems very wrong.  yeah. how'd chester get in here.  you're right, wanda.  chester and a.j. are acting totally weird.  but, on the other hand, i got a free scooter.     hey. what gives.  all scooters go the same preapproved speeda very safe two miles per hour.  why two miles an hour.  both: you'll spill your milk.   aah.  nothing says "home, sweet home," like a new marmleberry tree.  dad: honey, you should not have.  iaagh.  and i mean that literally.  this horrid tree was making our house unlike all the other houses.  milk.  well, my screams of terror did leave me parched.  dad, what happened to your tree.  i had to get rid of it.  it did not fit in, like your hat, or your teeth.  you're different.  i don't like where this is going.  all: drink your milk, timmy.  don't be different.  drink your milk.  dad: milk.  after him.  cosmo, wanda.  something about this place is making everybody zombies.  i wish we wereyour mom thought we would be happier if we were swimming in cool, refreshing, dimmadome farms milk, timmy.

milk, timmy.  oh, man.  i'm trapped.  cosmo and wanda are mindless zombies.  unless something incredible convenient occurs, i'm doomed.   i mean, hooray.   timmy: huh.  a secret underground dairy factory.  mom, dad, everyone.  they've all been turned into cowyanking zombies.  man: now, that's the best kind of zombie there is.   doug dimmadome.  that's right, i'm doug dimmadome, owner of the dimmsdale dimmadome and developer of dimmadome acres.  what have you done, doug dimmadome, developer of dimmadome acres.  why, i've done the impossible.  i've harnessed an endless pool of cheap milkyanking labor, and made people happy and welldressed to boot.  do these 4 stomachs make me look fat.  yes.  some might say it's wrong to use genetically modified milk to enslave folks' minds.  they would. they would.  but more milk means more mind control.  and more mind control means more money.  more money.  more money.  plus, i get to force 'em to live in my new chain of happy planned communities.  planned communities.  planned communities.  it's good business sense, son.  and with this last batch, i got enough contented cow milk to keep everybody happy here forever.  forever. but i'll miss the burp off.  now, son, be a good boy, and drink up.  all: do it.  do it.  both: moo it.  moo it.  fairies. fairies.  i'm sunk.  i don't have cosmo and wanda's magic to get me out of this one.  or do i.  i'll never drink your milk, doug dimmadome.  what a baby.  i mean, aw, shucks.  it's enough to bring a tear to your eye.  well, your eye or my eye.  everyone else is a mindless zombie, of course.   all righty then.  prepare to be cowyanked to oblivion.   what in tarnation.  what am i doing in this field.  aagh.  mr. dimmadome's right.  we shouldn't be in the middle of this field, we

both had something in common.  we both can't stand who our children married.  what is that supposed to mean.  it means i don't like you.  and what is that supposed to mean.  so, i decided to play along and stay here.  long enough so that wanda would get so wrapped in the family business that it would break you two up.  it's not a great plan, but i'm happy here.  mmm.  you should taste her veal.  but what about wanda girling up the business.  .  cosmo, show big daddy what's really going on.     she's girling up everything.  that's right.  and your boys are so upset, they're gonna take
