different than bender's.  timmy: teeth.  stupid.  big.  dr. bender: you might need to put those in the correct order.  he wouldn't be able to make fun of my teeth if everybody had the same teeth.  hey, you guys could do that, right.  well, sure, timmy.  then i wish everything and everybody in the world looked exactly the same.  hey. what happened. hey. i'm a gray blob.  everybody looks exactly

dominic.  are you timmy.  i just told you. i'm chet.  i hate this wish.  i can't tell which blob is our blob.   woman: very well. please hold.  very well. please hold. very well.  thank you for holding.  woman: hey. what's going on here.  what happened.  i was just granting my kid a wish for a pony, and now i'm here in fairy world.  i was just granting my kid a wish for a duckie, and now i'm in fairy world.  ..  because we were just granting a wish that everybody in the world looked exactly the same as everybody else, and now we're in fairywhat.  was that a bad thing.  man: yes.  it's the toughest fairy in the universejorgen von strangle.  right now, he's doing the von strangly part.  you two have caused a major magical fluctuation in the magic space continuum flux.  what's that mean.  jorgen: because of what you did, everyone now looks exactly the same, and none of the fairies can find their kids.  do you know what that's doing to the fairies.  ooh. ugh.  oh, no. magical backup.  that only happens when fairies can't grant wishes for their kids.  ha ha ha. i meanpoor little fairy.  we got to find timmy.  ..explode.  no. yow.  oh, no. cosmo.  ha. just goofing with you, baby.

hey, dr. bender. wendell.  ha ha ha.  actually, we're the grayest and the blobbiest.  but everyone is exactly alike.  that's where you're wrong, little notthatgray boy.  in fact, only blobs as gray and blobby as we are can have a gray ball as fun as this.  now, beat it.  i can't believe this.  everybody in the world's exactly alike, and those creeps still think they're better than everyone else.  got to get cosmo and wanda to find me there's no time to waste.  timmy. chet.  timmy. chet.  now are you timmy.  oh, no. magic buildup.  i'm not falling for that one again.  hey. it's raining me.

that's why they're still goofy and bender is still a jerk.  i changed their outsides, not their insides.  mom, can i have your hideous pink casserole.  sure.  there's no time to lose.  if i change my outside, then cosmo and wanda can find me.  i hope.  ..  with my pink hat. i'm different.  look. different.  who's the freak with the pink on his head.  let's get him and gray him up.  i can't find timmy anywhere, ..uhoh.  i'm starting to feel all explody.  cosmo. wanda. it's me. timmy.  i see a little pink dot.  that's our little pink dot.  you found me.  of course.  you stick out like a big, sore, pink thumb.  uh, less talky, more wishy.  i wish i was different again.  i wish the whole world was back to the way it's supposed to be.  my teeth. my head. my hat. my gosh.  what happened to you.  just make another wish.   what's the matter, timmy.  why aren't you and your friends hitting each other in the head with your ball.  aw, that creep dentist down the street won't give me my ball back because he doesn't like my teeth.  oh, really.  well, let's see if we can reason with him.  dr. bender: now go, other badtoothed boy and never darken our doorway again with your horrible bite radius.  here's your new boomerang, wendell.  this sure is a fun boomerang that's mine now.  ha ha.   give me back my ball, wendell.  what's the word i'm looking for.  oh, yeah.no.  ha ha ha. ha ha

better.  my dentures. give me back my perfect teeth.  jump ball. come on.  you want it. work for it.  and, dude, you left these at my house.  aah.  those don't belong in there.  who wants to play
