machine out of paper clips and yarn.    , build me a time machine out of paper clips and yarn.  it worked.  whoohoo.   poof.  whoa, i'm a guinea pig.  poof, i didn't mean an actual pet.  i  a cute little guinea pig.  must have made you out of paper clips and yarn.  oh, i'm gonna take you home and pet you ..  maybe this isn't so bad.  and then subject you to diabolical experiments.   to the crocker cave.   whoops, wrong lever.  that's the "f" mallet.   boing.  welcome to the crocker cave, my doomed little friend.  i'm going to use the dna of these lab animals to genetically transform myself into the perfect fairyhunting creature.  i'll have the nose of a bloodhound to sniff out fairies.  ..  fairies.  the armor of an armadillo ..  fairies.  the cheek pouches of a chipmunk to hold my ..  fairies.  and the fluffy hair of a persian cat.  the hair won't help me catchfairies.  but it'll make me a real chick magnet.  but before i subject myself to a potentially deadly experiment, i'll need to test it out on a guinea pig.  that's where you come in.  now to hook you up to my machine, which will suck the dna from all these animals.  i named it "mother," after the person who sucked the life out of me.  wait, you can't do this.  oh, well, what do you know.  a guinea pig that sounds like timmy turner.  now i'm going to enjoy this even more.  blast.  cosmo, the coast is clear.  not only that, but everyone's gone.  poof, where's timmy.  poofpoof.   oh, no, he says canada's being attacked by space oysters.  cosmo, he said he turned timmy into a guinea pig and mr. crocker took him to his lab.  canada, you're on your own.  we have to save timmy right away.  hey, look, a time machine.  what's this button do.   what's this button do.    hopefully, my experiment will work on you.  earlier i hooked mother up to mother, but she got a little too much bloodhound.   that's one freaky bloodhound.      you lived. my turn.      it worked.  i'm a persian bubble chipadillo hound.  oh, i hope the pet store sells food for this.  now to rocket into action.   deh. dugh.  note to self: next time go with eagle wings.  cosmo, wanda.  help.   what's this button do.   what's this button do.  ahah.  cosmo, we have to rescue timmy.  poof.  crocker turned himself into a fairycatching monster.  he's gonna capture every fairy in town.  put a sock in it, guinea pig.  we're looking for timmy.  cosmo, that guinea pig istimmy.   crocker before it's too late.  you know where all the fairies in town live, right.  well, sure, we've got their addresses in our fairy berries.  the closest fairy is juandissimo.  we've got to get to remi buxoplenty's house.   this is totally awesome.  i can fly.  dah. dueey.  well, kind of.  i have super stretchy chipmunk cheeks and a full head of cat hair.  for the first time in my life, i don't feel like a freak.   hello.  ..  fairy.   i so enjoy looking at myself in the mirror.  ..  two dissimos.  you're mine, muscleboy.  now

late.  we have to warn the other fairies.  let's split up.  i'll take timmy, wanda, poof, and cosmo.  good plan, let's go.   ahha.   heyhey.    blast.   there he is, guys.  i wish mr. crocker was back to normal.    crocker part armadillo.  oh, come on.  don't tell me armadillo armor really does shield him from fairy magic.  okay, we won't tell you.   and now for phase two of my plan, i'm going to hook youfairies.  up to my dna machine.  oh, no.  crocker's gonna drain the fairies of their magic.  we have to stop him, or he'll become a totally invincible super fairy.  crocker back to his lab.  we have to distract him and buy some time.  well, he's part bloodhound, right.  so i'll just poof into something no dog can resist.  poof.  the fire hydrant.  oh, i can't resist. yay.  uhoh, maybe i should have gone with a chew toy.  yahahahahah.  time to do a little rewiring.   well, the good news is, i bought us some time.  the bad news is too horrible to talk about.    he's coming. hide.  ..  fairy dna.  ..  fairies.  hmm, not quite as ominoussounding as i had hoped.  ..  the biggest fairy ever.  no, that's worse.  whatever.  oh, thank goodness we are out.  it was like a portapotty with teeth in there.  say goodbye to your dna, fairies.  ah.  turner, what are you doing here.  i'm turning you back to normal, mr. crocker.   ah. i'm a crockeroach.   blast.  dah. i'm a crockeroo.  blast.  ah. i'm a peacrocker.  ooh, actually, i kind of like this look.   blast.  i did it.  you're back to being plain old creepy mr.  crocker.  and now i'm gonna cut the fairies loose, and your lab animals
