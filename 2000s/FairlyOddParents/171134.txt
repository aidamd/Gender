we didn't know that, either.  apparently, the other thing i'm chockfull of is not knowing stuff.  hey, what if i acted like a kid again.  i could wish myself back to normal and you guys wouldn't have to leave.  hmm, i don't see anything that says you can't.  i smell loophole.  we'll discuss it at the next fairy convention.  come on, timmy.  ooh, let's find your inner child.  miniature golf is a

challenginga game that you can't wish yourself out of.  that wish is just vague enough to work.  but we're gonna need a lot of power to make it work.  one tough video game, coming up.  whoa.  what was that.  the power surged.  every light in the city dimmed.  that can only mean one thing.  both: timmy's got a new video game.  i hope timmy likes his new game.   hey, where's the dude.  it's 6:13.

in there or if they lose their 3 lives, they'll disappear forever.  what.  then i wish them out of the game.  you can't.  quote: "i wish for a video game that's challenging" unquote.  you either win the game or take off the helmet.  you guys don't do anything halfway, do you.  nope, we're two halves of a whole idiot.  oh, no.  great.  the video game is using so much energy that anything vicky plugs in could turn off the power and turn the game off.  those two are goners unless i get them out of there.  you guys keep vicky from using up any more power.  i'm going in.  he's being vague again.  vicky: and this is the tv, and this is the vcr, and this is the dvd and this is the surroundsound, and this is the combination microwave popcorn maker and neck massager and i don't know what this plug does, but i ain't payin' for the electricity.  we can't let her plug all those things in.  she'll blow the power.  come on.  follow me to the tv.  i've got an idea.  wednesday, march 22.  cosmo had an idea.  wanda.  you got some 'splainin' to do.  even though that's not the way everybody says "explaining," i respect our differences and your right to say it in the way you want.  eh, babaloo.  that, too.  wah.  boring.  and now here's cosmo with the weather.  i thought you saidfeather.  cool. the electric shredder balls of doom.  man, cosmo and wanda really made this game a lottougher.  i lost a lifeon level one.  what am i, 4.  just let me clarify this.  you married your car.  yep. now my kids get 17 miles to the gallon.   and we'll be right back.  yawn.   aah. if i'm not careful, i could get killed.  neat.  oh, no. another power surge.  aah.  cool.  this looks like an underwater version of my aunt gertrude's house.  hello, timmy.  let aunt gertrude pinch those chubby cheeks of yours.  i hope she means my face.  i'm a wanda coin. you may have one wish.  i wish i had cheeks of steel.  i hope you mean your face.  i do.  it's a show about nothing.  how do we

of teamwork, can wewhoa. come on. i'm on top of the desk.  ahh.  what the heck is wrong with this thing.  i'm all out of ideas.  well, easy come, easy go.  vicky: no wonder nothing's working.  all the

game.  how anticlimactic.  yeah, what a gyp.  oh, no. my helmet's still on.  we're still in the game.  ha ha ha.  well, well.  looks like i'm having 3 helpings of twerp for dinner.  guys, take off the helmets, quick.  don't freak, dude.  we still have two lives left.  that is one bad babysitter.  time to babysit.  aah.  no. they'll be gone forever.  oh, no. that was timmy's last life.  it's all
