charge of hoisting pianos.  safes, too.  and if you didn't pay attention, you could easily wander into a construction site, inadvertently avoiding pile drivers, ..  falling from dizzying heights, only to be saved by rising steel girders.  for reasons no one fully understands, old people and children seemed drawn to danger, so we'll have to be extra careful.  cosmo. we've gotta catch those wands.

the sun. i'm blind.  i warned ya.  hyuk. hyuk.  i wish we were back in the real world.  hee hyuh hyuh. you got it.  boy howdy, that captain green sure can rap.  .  timmy. pappy.  how was your evening.  top shelf.  i'll come back any time you need me.  awesome. no more vicky.  timmy's the greatest.  he made everything like an old cartoon with some newfangled hoosie what'sit.  and there were foxes
