pappy. we'll catch up.  come on, timmy. shake a leg.   man, this is great.  oh, don't be fooled by the jollity and mirth.  old cartoons were a dangerous place.  easily distracted young men were put in charge of hoisting pianos.  safes, too.  and if you didn't pay attention, you could easily wander into a construction site, inadvertently avoiding pile drivers, ..  falling from dizzying heights, only to be saved by rising steel girders.  for reasons no one fully understands, old people and children seemed drawn to danger, so we'll have to be extra careful.  cosmo. we've gotta catch those wands.

was a waste of money," i say nuts.  23 skidoo. wheee.  say, timmy.  you better keep those samolians under your cap just in case something goes screwy.  come on, pappy. what could possibly go wrong.  pegfoot vicky.  hey, soda jerk.  pppegfoot vicky.  who're the 2 swells at the end of the bar.  i don't know.  they're spending money like there's no tomorrow.  there won't be if i have anything to say

to take care of vicky.  wait. you can't hit girls in old cartoons.  oh, good point.  i wish vicky was a boy.  ah.  good thing i'm wearing gloves.  now you gets a taste of me hurricane hook.  ahhh.  the sun. i'm blind.  i warned ya.  hyuk. hyuk.  i wish we were back in the real world.  hee hyuh hyuh. you got it.  boy howdy, that captain green sure can rap.  .  timmy. pappy.  how was your evening.  top shelf.  i'll come back any time you need me.  awesome. no more vicky.  timmy's the greatest.  he made everything like an old cartoon with some newfangled hoosie what'sit.  and there were foxes with magic wands, a band that beat music out of animals, and then i was kidnapped.  .. by eating vegetables.  ok. timmy.  ..forever.  well, timmy, looks like i won't be babysitting for a while.  so i guess there's only one thing left to do.  wiggle our fingers.  you got it.  well, sport, you didn't get rid of vicky, but you did learn something very important.  just because something's really,
