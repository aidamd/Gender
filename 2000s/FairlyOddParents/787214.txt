" wasn't that a great story, poof.    oh, great.  i forgot, when poof cries, bad things happen.  was that thunder, or did i pull my own finger.  oh, it's okay, poof.  timmy, did you read poof a scary story and make him cry.  i read poof a story, but there was nothing scary about it.  the super scary boogie monster who lives under your bed and will totally eat you when it gets dark.  ah. that book is terrifying.  there are words in it.  eeh. honey.  it's raining in the den, and there's a whale on the sofa.  there. see, poof.  everything's okay.  why don't we all get ready for bed.  good idea, wanda.  night, guys.   timmy, poof's still scared.  would you mind if we turned on his nightlight.  knock yourselves out.  i can sleep through anything.  ah. what's going on.  that's poof's nightlight, the retina melter 2000.  ah, my retinas.  you've got to be kidding me.  guys, this is ridiculous.  i wish the nightlight was out.  sorry about this, poof.  poofpoof.  eeh.   ah, that's better.  now i can finally get some sleep.  ah, lalala.  it's morning already.  nothing like 12 seconds of sleep to make you ready to take on the day.  boy, you look terrible.  that's 'cause i need more than 12 seconds of sleep.  i wish it was totally dark for 12 hours.  no light at all.  timmy, that's dangerous.  think of the horrible accidents that could happen.  oh, you're right.  i wish it was dark for 12 hours but i had this flashlight to find the bathroom.  good call.  we don't want you using the fishbowl again.   timmy, there's a fun fact you should know about the dark, a scary story that's really true, " ah.  this story's just as terrifying.  it has words in it too.  ah.   um, timmy, wanda broke your tv.  the legend says, if fairies go for more than eight hours in the dark, we turn into vicious, crazy, fanged beasts who eat their godkids.  what.  oh, i get it.  you're trying to get back at me for scaring poof.  nice try.  i'm going to sleep now, totally not scared.  okay, mr. fearless.  but when you wake up lightly seasoned in a pot of boiling water, don't say we didn't warn you.  ha.  fairies.  scary.    .  ah, ten hours of sleep, just what i needed.  ooh, i wonder if cosmo and wanda are scary fairies now.   hey, why am i in the bathtub.  and what's cooking.  it smells delicious.  where's the flashlight.  uhoh.  this isn't a bathtub.  but i do smell delicious.  hi, timmy.  you're looking well roasted.  uh, don't you mean "well rested".  no. no.  ah.  that should hold 'em.  now to get out of here.  ah.  uh. uh.  uh, stairs.  ..  ah.  living room.  man, that was a long fall.  eeh, sorry, son.  i just waxed the stairs and added more of them.  what happened to the light.  is it a power outage or an eclipse.  this is chet ubetcha saying it's not a power outage, and your eyes are open.  oh, good, honey, you found a radio.  no, i didn't.  it's dark in dimmsdale, and i'm lost.  this also just in: a circus train has derailed in the dark.  the crash has freed a pack of rare and hungry sabertoothed tigers with night vision.  citizens are advised to stay home and not do anything to attract the savage carnivores.  ah.  eeh, sorry, chet.  i just installed a new trap door in the living room.  sabertoothed tigers on the loose.  oh, looks like i picked a bad day to thaw out all our frozen beef.  and i picked a bad time to smear my naked body in cat food.  dad's naked.   ah. ah.  yah.  oh, timmy, we're back to normal.  and we totally don't want to eat you anymore.  you don't.  ah.  scary fairies lie.  there's the front door.  i'm out of here.  uh.  ah.  uh.  sorry, son.  i moved our house to the top of a hill because the view is so much better.  you'll see what i mean if we live to see the sunrise again.  in the meantime, we're going to drag our lacerated bodies to the hospital, sweetie.  you be careful.  eeh, eeh, eeh.  is she kidding.  i'm not moving from this spot until this wish is over.   hello.  eeh, hi, timmy.  forgot to tell you, when i moved the house to the top of the hill, i also moved it closer to the freeway.  have fun.    ah.  uh. uh.   oh, no. train.  ah.  uh.  don't tell me.  airport.  prepare for takeoff.  ah.  ah.  uh.  uh.  dimmsdale trampoline emporium.  all right.  and i bet, after all that, i only have a few minutes of darkness left.  90 minutes more.  oh, come on.   mr. crocker, what are you doing.  i figured it was you who plunged dimmsdale into complete darkness.  so i hopped in the crocker copter to find you and say, "f".  thanks to the nuclear reactor i built in the basement, all my "f"s now glow in the dark.  of course, so does mother.  ooh, get away, you stupid moths.  but i don't, which means you won't be able to see me sneak into your house to hunt for your fairies.   wow, i must be really hungry.  it wasn't your stomach growling.  that was a bunch of escaped sabertoothed tigers with night vision.  if that's true, i picked a bad day to wear my new pork chop underpants.  you're wearing pork chop underpants.   ah. take it up, mother.  ah.  not the pork chops.  phew, finally, i'm safe.   hello.  hi, timmy. it's tootie.  it's dark and scary out, just like my love for you.  uh, yeah, gee, too bad i'm miles away and you'll never find me.  found you.  now how about a kiss, lover boy.  muah.  ah.   uh.  watch out for the brick wall i built to surround our love.    uh.  where am i.  you're in the hospital, young man.  you ran into a brick wall over and over and have been unconscious for an hour.  an hour. sweet.  that means i only have half an hour to go.  lucky for you, this young girl has been passionately giving you mouthtomouth this whole time.  i'll be waiting for you to pass out again, lover boy.  ah.   thank goodness this hospital is so big.  i think i lost tootie in the operating room.  i want a timmychanga.  and i want a plate of timsum.  very clever.  but you know what, guys.  i've decided not to be scared of you anymore.  never mind.  you guys are even scarier fairies now.  did i hear someone mention fairies.  mr. crocker.  what are you doing in the hospital.  i had to get those tigers surgically removed from my underwear.  i don't know which was worse, the tiger attack or the passionate mouthtomouth from mother.  anyhoo, i'll take a fairy now. thank you.   uh. uh.  uh, wow, they're more ferocious than i remember.  mother, start the crocker copter while i drag my lacerated body towards you.  crocker sure worked up an appetite.  yeah, i want a blt sandwich.  that's bacon, lettuce, and timmato.  yah.  uh.  there you are, timmy.  paddle to help you pass out again.  ah.   uh.  uh.   yah.    uh.  oh, no. i think i'm on the roof.  that means i'm trapped.    wait, only 30 seconds left until the lights come on.  i can do this.  oh, no. maybe i can't.  five seconds.  four, three, two.  ah.  no.  stop eating me.  ah.  wait, the wish is over.  the light's back on, and i'm not in cosmo's stomach.  yep, we're back to normal, and just in time too.  you were pretty scared, sport.  no, i wasn't.  ah. yes, i was.  i was scared.  turn the lights on.   boy, we really got you, timmy.  ..  wanda broke your flower pot.  wait a minute.  you guys were only pretending to be scary fairies.  yep.  you needed to learn your lesson about scaring poof.  poof, i'm really sorry i scared you and that i made such a silly wish.  i don't ever want that much darkness again.  and while there's still daylight, i'm gonna enjoy it.  ah. thud.  the house is still on a hill, son.  yay. timmy's unconscious again.  @hp7ra<'r animaprd     t p @ oo.pw ah t t t @@p...i63 0p

vacation ever, one whole week at the golden carcass luxury motel in tucson, arizona.  uh.  aw, what's wrong, sport.  you don't seem too excited.  it's just that my dad gets lost on the way to every vacation.  dad, i don't think we're in the desert.  yee, what makes , timmy.  we just passed santa's workshop.  merry christmas.    timmy's right.  we're lost.  oh, nonsense, honey.  men have gpsses for brains.  we never go the wrong way.   all: wrong way.    another elf on the windshield and another vacation gone horribly wrong, ..   ..   and our trip to dragon country safa.   no.  i can't ruin another vacation.  i know.  i'll build a boat and sail my family to safety, and i won't feel like a man till i do.  i'll just feel like a woman named linda.  and i'll do what i always do on these vacations: light a signal fire and gather coconuts.  i feel bad for your father, sport.  maybe i should just poof us all back home.  nope, you heard my dad.  he's not gonna feel better unless he saves us.  besides, he and the elf are handling things just fine.  geh. geh.  linda broke her fingernail.  anyway, while my dad works on saving us, i'm gonna enjoy an actual vacation.  ah, this is the life, kicking back on the beach with no school and no mr. crocker.   i wonder what he's doing now.  " hmm.  it just doesn't feel the same.  here, put these on.  " uh, still no good.  without turner to humiliate, my life has lost all meaning.  i don't feel like a man anymore.  i feel like a woman named linda.  ah. linda broke her fingernail.  timmy, i stole these berries from an angry monkey.  would you try them to see if they're poisonous.  no need for poisonous berries, mom.  wow, where did you get a smoothie, club sandwich, and curly fries.  uh, i snared them in a net.  oh, you're quite the little survivor.  hm, unlike your father, linda.  linda heard that.  dad, i brought you a sandwich and a drink.  whoa.  what is this.  eeh, it's a boat store.  everyone knows you can't get a boat without a boat store.  uh, wouldn't it be easier to just build a boat.  sure, timmy.  and it would be easier to count to 7 if 7 came before 5.  but life doesn't work that way.  okay.  look, i think you've been out in the sun a little too long.  why don't you put on some sun block.  deh, no need, son.  i'm wearing a hat.  uh.  timmy, i think your dad's gone a little crazy.  shouldn't we poof back to dimmsdale now.  no, if my dad doesn't save us on his own, we'll have to call him "linda" forever, and he'll feel totally useless.  i feel totally useless.  oh, linda, what are you going to do.  without turner to destroy, you've become a shell of a woman.   clear the area.  this building is about to be demolished.  that's it.  can't destroy turner, but maybe watching something else get destroyed will cheer me up.  crash.  nothing.  i feel nothing.  uh. okay, i felt that.  thanks for the waterslide, guys.  whoohoo.  now how about poofing me up a frozen yogurt stand.  oh, yeah.  all: uhluhluhluhluhluh.  oh, look, a waterslide and a frozen yogt stand.  i wonder where those came from.  uh, global warming.  well, that makes sense.  and i'd better check on poof.  i promised i'd help him build a sandcastle.  poofpoof.  well, it's a start, poof, but you totally forgot the moat.  clang.  poofpoof.  timmy, oh, you're just in time for the grand opening of linda's boat store.  whoa.  all we have to do is take one of these boats and sail home.  timmy, we can't just take a boat.  that would be stealing.  we have to buy one from the boat salesman.  but i haven't built him yet.  where'd you get the power saw.  i borrowed it from stanley over at the hardware store i built.  it's right next to the laundromat.  hi, stanley.  i see you're out for a stroll with the missus.  wanda was right.  we need to get my dad out of here.  what did you find, poof.  poofpoof.  just what i always wanted, a bombshaped alarm clock.  what's this button do.  beep.  aw, i was hoping it was the radio.  stupid alarm clock.  let's hit it with a hammer.    uh, general mccloud, remember that bomb we lost.  which one, sergeant flint.  we're the u.s. military.  we lose bombs every day.  uh, it's the one that looks like a big alarm clock.  well, it's been activated.  fantastic.  a depressed fifthgrade teacher has brought his class on a field trip.  they're gonna love watching an island explode.  is the island named timmy.  whoohoo.  wanda. what's that humming sound.  uh.  hey, guys.  man, are you having a bad hair day.  cosmo, what is that thing.  oh, this.  just a stupid alarm clock.  want to know the time.  it's 10:29.  10:28.  10:27.  cosmo, that's a bomb.  a bomb.  you guys got to poof me and my parents out of here right now.    oh, that bomb's putting out a magnetic field that's affecting our magic.  oh, no.  now the only one who can save us is my dad.   dad, we've got to get out of here fast.  there's a bomb on the island.  no problem, timmy.  i just bought a boat from eduardo here.  eduardo, you've got yourself a deal.  oh, no.  this is a disaster.  you're telling me.  eduardo's hurt bad.  it's a good thing i built a hospital next to the airport.  we could take that plane home, but i don't know how to fly.  i'm gonna go build a flight school.  ah. dad, listen to me.  you wanted to save our family, right.  this is your big chance.  well, we could always use the submarine, i guess.    with all the spare time i had, i converted the station wagon into an amphibious vehicle.  that's awesome.  i'll get mom.  and i'll get stanley and his headless wife.   welcome to the tour.  it's your lucky day.  you get to watch an island blow up.  have a complimentary juice box.    general mccloud, the island's inhabited.  it's turner.  he's about to be destroyed for real.  suddenly i feel alive again.  we can't blow up a populated island, linda.  besides, there's an elf on it.  we'll all end up on santa's naughty list.  deactivate that bomb, sergeant.  no.   say, the circuits are fried.  i can't stop the bomb from detonating.  hooray.  i mean, oops.  can you zoom in on the kid with the beaver teeth.  hang on, everyone.  i'll save you or my name isn't linda.  hurry.  who knows how much time we have till that bomb explodes.  we have five, ..  cosmo, get rid of that bomb.     hooray.  best tour ever.   good news, kids.  everyone on the island made it to safety.  eh.   no.  mother, my mother.  now, now, linda.  a pretty lady like you shouldn't cry.   you did it, linda.  i mean dad.  you're a hero.  that was the best vacation ever.  honey, i think you're going the wrong way again.  am not.   ooh, we are so going to be on santa's naughty list.  wrong way. wrong way.   ho, ho, ho.  linda.  mmmmmmm.  now
