"a".  so in conclusion, grandfather clocks are not made out of real grandfathers.  i wish i'd known that a year ago.  ..ehh...tock.  and so you can see, sticks and stones may break your bones, but names leave psychological wounds that never heal.   my dad may be the most popular student in class, but at least i still have my friends.  i can watch tv whenever i want.  i don't have a bedtime, and i can drive.  becky, your dad gave us macaroni and told us how neat it is to be a grownup.  he is too cool for school.  you know what goes great with macaroni.  ice cream, my treat.  oooh, sorry, becky, looks like we're out of room.  why don't you walk through rattlesnake canyon and meet us there.  wow, turner, you're still too cool for school.  i am.  i am.    oh, no.  my dad's not falling for that old line again, is he.        turner.  turner.  skipping school with timmy's hoodlum father sure is cool.  yeah, melvin the genius janitor was right.  hey, you kids should be in school.  gah.

of school, and we're out of toilet paper.  i don't know what we're gonna do.  either i have to get a job or you have to get a job, which means you have to get a job.  toilet paper isn't cheap, you know.  crazy old mrs. turner has a point.  guys, i don't want to get a job.  working is the only thing worse than learning.  i gotta find a way to get my dad back in school.  forget it, becky.  your father was my star student until he stopped coming to class and broke my heart.  crocker, but there's gotta be some way my dad could still pass the fifth grade.  well, there is one way.  ..  but no one's ever survived that.  besides, i'd have to okay it, and i don't see why i should.  i'll give you dad's lifetime supply of macaroni.  i'm no math whiz, .. a lifetime.  one big super test coming up.  a big super test.  that's for nerds.   why is there a jukebox in my kitchen.  dad, listen to me.  you went back to school to finish your education and make me proud.  eh, education's for dweebs.  come on, guys.  let's go burn some rubber on crazy old mrs.  turner's lawn.  i'm right here.   dad, don't you see.  you're making the same mistake in school again.  you say you want to make me proud, but by the way you're behaving, i'm not proud of you at all.  ..not...proud of me.   oh, becky, you're right.  what am i doing.  i do want to finish school and make you proud, but there's no way i could pass the big super test now.  sure there is.  you only need a cminus pass.  i'm sure we can do it.   we.      ..   argon, manganese.    argh. argh. argh.  ahahhahhahhahh.  ..  swaziland.   both:

:itiertaw0y cexr@hw welcome to the von strangle family bakery, timmy, where everything is magically delicious.  you can even eat the walls.  no, you can't, cosmo.  oh, then you better take me to the hospital.  ahhhh.  jorgen, you work here.  that is right, turner.  you see, in addition to being supreme guardian of fairy world, i am also a minimum wage stooge at my grandmother's bakery.  boom. boom.  hard to believe we are related, huh.  ..  and timmy turner.  you want to kickbox for a strudel.  uh, no, thanks, but those brownies look good.  don't mind if i do.  hands off.  agh. ohh. ugh.  those are my awardwinning extreme fairycherry brownies.  they are not for the customers.  nana made them for tomorrow's big annual bakeoff between the fairies and the antifairies.  and by the way, that is an exploding pie.   poofpoof.  more.  good.  moooore.  poof, you're not supposed to eat those.  mooore.  good.  moooore.  ah, hahaha.  we have a brownie breach.  ahh, ah, haha.  ahhhaha.  cupcake.  ignoramus, i'm a giant frosted scone.  ahhhh.  that was close.  if that fiend had escaped with the brownie, he could have deciphered the recipe, a recipe that is kept in a secret vault in the basement, which i guess is no longer a secret, since i just told you about it.  dumdum.  poof, that was the last brownie.  now we'll have to make another batch for the bakeoff tomorrow.   i'm gonna get poof to a browniefree zone.  cosmo, timmy, don't do anything stupid while i'm gone.  why does she always say that to us.  i don't know.  now let's do something stupid.  poof me up another one of those brownies i'm not supposed to have.  sorry, timmy, they're magic brownies.  i can only poof them up by using the secret recipe.  then take me down to that basement vault, so i can get the recipe.  that sounds perfectly stupid.  getting that brownie recipe's gonna be a piece of cake.  wait a minute.  that means getting a cake recipe would be a piece of brownie.  hold me, timmy, i'm freaking myself out.  retinal scan failed.  you are not nana boom boom.  prepare to be annihilated.  ahhh.  cosmo, you need to make me look like nana boom boom.  retinal scan match.  nana boom boom identified.  prepare for brownietobrain download.  ahhhh.  ahhhh.  timmy, are you okay.  ..  2 cups of fairy flour, 4 golden goose eggs, a dash of troll dandruff.  whoa, the recipe got zapped into my head.  it looks as though timmy turner has what we came for, and you mocked me for buying xray glasses from the back of a comic book.  why do we need them brownies anyway.  we can win that bakeoff with my roadkill critter cake.  no offense, dear, but no one wants a dessert that hunts mice in a sewer.  we need that brownie recipe.  brownie, brownie, brownie, brownie.  no, i don't have any brownies.  how about a nice flavorfree teething biscuit instead.  more brownie.   brownie.  where have you two been.  brownies.  well, we weren't in the bakery vault stealing the supersecret brownie recipe, if that's what you're implying.  you stole the recipe.  more.  it's just a recipe for a stupid bakeoff.  it's not the end of the world.  yes, it is.  timmy, thousands of years ago, there was an epic battle between the fairies and the antifairies to determine who got to have fairy godchildren.  after years of horrible war, we decided to settle things the only logical ..  with an annual bakeoff.  nana boom boom's brownies win every year, but if the antifairies get that recipe, they'll win the bakeoff and inherit all the god kids, including you, sport.  you're in terrible danger until you return that recipe to the vault.  browns.  yeah, there's a problem with that.  i accidentally downloaded it into my head.  hi, tony.  we've come to suck out the contents of your ..  i mean vacuum your room.  we're not evil imposters.  that's the last time i order momanddad costumes from the back of a comic book.  now, hold still, while i painfully suck ..and your brain.. out of your ear canal.  don't worry, timmy, we'll save you.  timmy, save us.  ahhhhh.  thanks, jorgen.  don't mention it.  now, hold still, while i remove your head.  ahhhhh.  there must be a less violent way to get the fairycherry brownie recipe out of timmy's brain.  the fairycherry brownie recipe is in his brain.  turner, if you have the recipe, we must get you to a safe house.  cool safe house.  thanks, i ordered it from the back of a comic book.  it is completely magicproof.  no one can poof in or out.  turner, we must keep you here until the fairies win the bakeoff.  this whole thing is crazy.  why would you decide the fate of fairy god kids with a bakeoff.  well, we tried tiddlywinks, but it was too painful.  both: my eye.  anyway, the bakeoff worked out great for fairy world.  nothing is as delicious as nana's brownies.  well, nothing except my breadfree toast.  i love the breadfree taste.  anyway, toodles, and don't do anything stupid.  why is everyone looking at me.  who wants meatfree meatballs.   open up.  that was quick, jorgen.  i am not jorgen.  arrggh.  ahhhh.   ahhahahaha.  ahhh.  ohhhhhhhhhhhh.   we're in trouble.  the antifairies got timmy, which means they have the recipe.  relax, guys.  i finally did something not stupid.  i had a feeling the antifairies might track us down, so i got cosmo to do the old switcheroo.  wait a minute.  if you're here, then the antifairies have cosmo.   have you found anything in his brain yet.  i haven't even found his brain.  i'd look a little lower.  found it, and i think i got somethin'.  it's a recipe, ahoo.  the brownies, yes.  print the recipe and start baking.  add 4 golden goose eggs and a dash of troll dandruff.  hurry, nana.  the bakeoff is about to begin.  and somebody get this poor troll some medicated shampoo.  this is fairy hart for the fairy channel.  i'm live at the 90thousandth annual magical bakeoff, which will decide the fate of fairy godchildren everywhere.    we're going to make it.  mooore.  we are not going to make it.  wanda, don't you ever feed that kid.  nana boom boom, quick, make another batch.  our bakeoff judge, mother nature, has just arrived.   welcome, mother nature.  it's a beautiful day.   thank you, i made it myself.  with the antifairies having submitted their entry, we're still waiting for nana boom boom von strangle to arrive with the fairies' dessert.  this is it, dear.  as soon as mother nature tastes timmy's brownies, every fairy godchild will be ours.    the brownies are done.  now let's get to that bakeoff.  time is almost up for the fairies.  it looks like they're going to be disqualified.  boom. boom.  i stand corrected.  nana boom boom has arrived with her entry.  ladies and gentlemen, the judging is about to begin.  there's nothing here.  it's not nice to fool mother nature.  both: ahhhh.  what have you done, woman.  there's nothing on that plate.  don't blame me.  i followed that recipe exactly, ahoo.  yeah, it's my recipe for breadfree toast: 0 cups flour, 0 cups water, 0 minutes in oven.   ahhhh.  ahhhahhahhhhhh.  moooore.  raaah.   wait.  ooh.  ..good...more.   all: ahhh.   uh, i mean, i declare the winners ..the fairies.    bthhhbt.  good work, turner.  thanks to your quick thinking and cosmo's empty brain, victory is ours.  even though you selfishly broke into my vault and stole my recipe, you deserve a reward.  here, have some pie.  awesome, your pie is the bomb.   boom. boom.  cool party.  smoothies.  ...  they've been burstified. huh.  you know from the danimaliciousburst of flavor.  .  what. burstified.  pogo stick burstified.
