 not so fast, timmy.  you can't interfere with the past.  if you change anything here, it could alter the future.  squirrelasaurus.   no, sparky.  if you eat that squirrel, there could be a future without squirrels.  they're just fluffy rats.  go get him, sparky.   oh, no. the fluffy rat's angry mother.   cosmo, come back.   hey, erg, i'm not supposed to talk to you because it could totally ruin the future, but do you want to play a video game from the future.  it's got awesome 3d flesheating zombies.  huh.    again, that might be a little advanced for you.     well, i don't think i changed the future, but i am gonna have to change my pants.  sparky, spit it out.  well, guys, it was great meeting erg, who i did not introduce to future things.  now, let's move on to another godkid so we can get home before my favorite mindless tv show.  move, move, move.  cosmo, remember him. the earl of sandwich.  you bet i do.  he invented the earl, whatever that is.  he invented the sandwich.  all right, everyone, before we go, make sure we don't leave anything from the future behind.  timmy, didn't you have a video game.   what. no, what.  i didn't do it.  aw, there he is, cosmo, the earl of sandwich right before he invented the sandwich.  looking at those shirt stains, it might have been better if he invented the moist towelette.  it's 17th century us.  look at me wearing a powdered wig.  a powdered donut.  both stylish and delicious.  hey, earl.  we're gonna go visit the earl of nachos.  apparently he invented something pretty awesome.  i don't know what it is, but the earl of movie theaters is dying to get his hands on it.  let's see.  roast beef, lettuce, bread.  if only there were a way to jam them all together and shove them in my mouth at the same time.  i don't think this earl guy is gonna share his roast beef, so i'm going for those nachos.  come on, cosmo, we better go get sparky.  the fate of nachos is in our hands.  that's a lot of pressure and a lot of squirty cheese.  eureka.  i can use these two pieces of bread as a convenient carrying case.  kid from the future coming through.  don't interact with me. heyho.  is that peppered ham.  oh, dear, you've made me spill my flagon of ox milk.  look, the bread is soaking up the spill.  gracious me, i invented the spill soaker upper.  i invented the sponge dude.  i'm going to be famous.  we're back, timmy.  we stopped sparky from eating the nachos and introduced him to the earl of kibble, so everything is okay.  mmm, i'd love a corn beef on rye.  where's the earl of sandwich. what.  no, what. i didn't do it.  uh, why don't we go see another fairy godkid.  move, move, move.  ooh, ben franklin.  how about we visit him. good idea.  i think i owe little benny an apology.  last time i saw him, i told him to go fly a kite.   . .  holy cow, he's still flying a kite.  it was just an expression.  oh, no, i just remembered i told little amelia earhart to get lost.  benny, we're going inside.  what do you mean.  you're the one who told me to fly a kite.  if i told you to jump in a lake, would you.  oh, no. what.  cosmo, you didn't tell one of our other godkids to jump in a lake, did you.  no, i just remembered i left my bowling ball at fred and wilma's.   ha, ha, the lightning missed me.   well, at least water doesn't conduct electricity.   oh, no, sparky. we got to go save him.  do you have a colonial squirrel in your mouth.    oh, no, ben. watch out for the lightning.   i say, why did you forcibly throw me to the ground.  uh, wasn't me. it was, um, the wind.  well, mysterious stranger, you've made me realize lightning is a dangerous source of energy, so i'm gonna figure out how to power things with something else.  a potato, maybe.  wait, no. electricity's not bad.  i mean, i'm the wind.  what happened to benny. who knows.  i mean, stop blaming me for things.  who's the next kid.  oh, that's megan bacon.   not megan bacon.  what's so bad about her. nothing now.  but when she was a kid, she was theoh, yeahembodiment of evil.  she wasn't that bad, cosmo.  you know, timmy, she went on to open the cake 'n bacon.  i want to meet her.  timmy, you can't interact with her, remember.  of course not. i'm the wind.  let's go.  hey, where's the old version of you guys.  we were hiding in the closet, which i'm gonna go do now.  she's terrifying, timmy. come on, sparky.  will you two morons get back here.  hey, who are you. me.  oh, i'm, uh, the mailman.  i just came in your room to tell you there's no mail today.  you know, someone told me you were terrifying, but you look harmless.  i'm sweet as pie.   i'm just miserable 'cause my fairies are making me do my homework.  they never let me play. really.  that's crazy.  kids shouldn't be oppressed by homework, chores, and responsibilities.  you should do whatever you want to do.  great idea, mr. mailman.  let's play super villain and victim.  i'll be the diabolical caped bacon, and you'll be the loser i annihilate with my bacon blaster.  okay. wait, what.  feel the burn.    hot bacon.  you're the embodiment of evil.  this is way more fun than homework.  my reign of terror begins.  nah, he's still here.  how's it hanging, timmy.  sport, you didn't interact with megan, did you.  me. no, what. megan, what, who.  why don't we forget the whole silly time traveling.  let's go celebrate your anniversary at the cake 'n bacon with your best fairy godkid ever.  we can't, timmy.  little mahatma gandhi didn't eat bacon.  no, me. i'm the best fairy godkid.   oh, good one.  hey, wait a minute. what happened to dimmsdale.  oh, no, i totally messed up the future.  i'm the worst fairy godkid ever.  if your dad was here, he'd totally put a cone on you.  .  . and i would walk 500 more .  . just to be the man who... .  . da da la da. da da la da. .  . da da la da da da la da da....  that's mixed up.  look at that.vhuh.  that's mixed up.  mix up your favorite foods with lunchables with 100% juicekabobbles.  what's the matter.  you never seen a friend carry another friend in a backpack.  new from lego ninjago airjitsu build high flying action and create your own tricks train your skills and rip into battle new lego ninjago airjitsuflyers reach set sold separetly sparky, dimmsdale gone crazy.  what have i done to the world.   that is my cue to berate you, turner.  because of your meddling, little erg the cave boy never invented the wheel.  so that's why all the cars have weird tires.  eedriving, owhurts, ow.  and ben franklin never discovered electricity.  which explains why dimmsdale is powered by a giant potato.  and, perhaps worst of all, the earl of sandwich never invented the sandwich, which is why i'm eating a fistful of lunch meat and squirting mustard into my mouth.   i wanted deli mustard, not dijon.  you didn't mess with the kid who invented with deli mustard.  did you. relax, jorgen.  i'll just get my fairies to unwish the whole mess.  cosmo, wanda.  don't waste your breath, turner.  because they failed to prevent you from ruining the past, they have been fired as fairy godparents.  fired. where are they.  well, cosmo got a big job in advertising.   1/2 off on cell phones.   what's a matter you.  i'm paying you to advertise my restaurant.  " i can't read the sign. it keeps spinning.  you're fired.  yay. i hated this job.  now i can live out my dream of working on my tan and sipping lemonade.  and wanda got a job at the fairy world library, though i have a feeling that won't last long.   excuse me.  i'd like to check this book out.   do you have your library card.  all: shh. use your inside voice.  this is my inside voice.  oh, no, how am i gonna fix this without my fairies.  sparky, you got any ideas.  oh. i've lost sparky too.  nah, i just went back in time to get more bacon.  wait a minute, if you can travel back in time, that means we can fix everything i messed up.  well, hurry up.  i have to figure out what to do with this handful of tuna salad.   erg, game bad.  wheel good.  you know i can speak, right.  i totally just beat your high score.  what. no way.  twoplayer mode, you and me, right now.  i mean, just finish the wheel.   okay, first problem fixed.  never say "fixed" in front of a dog, timmy.  just poof us to the earl of sandwich.  this is perfect.  i can use the rye bread to mop up this gravy and the pumpernickel for the really tough spills.  okay, just stop it.  you're supposed to use the bread to hold the food together, like this.  where's the roast beef.   i don't know.  spit it out, sparky.  the fate of the world is at stake.  i'll call it the sports bra.  just call it "the sandwich," bozo.   the sandwich bozo.  that has a nice ring to it.  thank you, weird kid with a feminine hat.  come on, sparky.  let's go push ben franklin into a bolt of lightning.  hey, ben, time to go back outside and discover electricity.  but potatoes are the power source of the future and the perfect side dish for sandwich bozos.  maybe someday i'll use a giant potato to power a whole town, kind of.  sounds like this dude's already been hit by lightning.  just go.   are you alive. just barely.  good enough. our work here is done.  yeah. we did it.  dimmsdale's back to normal.  but why aren't cosmo and wanda back.  there must be something i still haven't fixed.  " timmy turner, we meet again.  megan bacon. is that you.  that's right, timmy, and because you encouraged me to be myself, i never opened the cake 'n bacon.  instead, i lived out my dream of being an evil super villain, the caped bacon.  okay, sister.  it was cute when you were ten, but an adult baconthemed villain is super lame.  really.  let's see if you think this is lame.  grease release.  whoa.  wow, i don't know whether to be terrified or lick the highway.  sparky, we got to go back in time and stop her from being herself, 'cause herself stinks.  you got it, timmy. not so fast.  your fairy dog can't help you.  in fact, no one can stop me from fulfilling my highcholesterol evil plan.   hang on, sparky. i'll save you.  she's got a lot of bacon.   this is terrible.  i got to figure out what she's up to and rescue sparky, but where did she ke h.  and i have my answer.  hey, nut job, i got to watch my cholesterol.  you got an turkey bacon.  turkey bacon's not real bacon.  i got to stop her. oh, i know.  i'll just wait until her diet kills her.  soon my giant frying pan will cook fairy world, and i'll destroy cosmo and wanda for trying to stop me from becoming the evil super villain i was meant to be.   not so fast, megan bacon.  whoa.   nice try, timmy, but i've coated the floors with bacon grease.  why.  it's part of my baconthemed villainy.  cosmo and wanda were only trying to help.  they just wanted you to use your love of delicious comfort foods for good instead of evil.  anyway, my magic dog and i are gonna stop you right now.  get her, boy.  ladies and gentlemen, my loyal dog, sparky.   ha.  i've trapped you with my baconstraints.  wow, this stuff is thick.  it's canadian bacon.  in two minutes, fairy world will be completely fried.  then i'll place it on a giant paper towel to absorb all the grease.   and now, to boil you alive in molten lava.  okay, how's that baconthemed.  i ran out of bacon ideas. sue me.    i got you, timmy, and i brought reinforcements too.  all: heroes of history, unite.  seriously.  i'll smash you all into bacon bits.  ooh, that's good.  i should use that one instead of the lava thing.  anyway, you're too late. fairy world is doomed.  hurry, guys.  we only have a minute to save cosmo and wanda.   ow, my foot.  you hairy little jerk.  electricity powers, activate.  i'm blinded intermittently.   good work, guys.  you're, um, a force to be reckoned with.  now it's time to shut down that frying pan.  think again. you're all history.  technically, only three of us are from history.  shut up, ben franklin.  fairy world is about to go on my sizzle reel.  ha, i am killing it with the bacon puns.  . .  is it me, or is it getting hot in here.  all: shh.  i've finally fulfilled my lifelong dream of sitting on a street corner, sipping lemonade.   cosmo, fairy world's burning up.  we got to poof ourselves out of here.  can't you see i'm working.  we cannot escape.  the evil megan bacon has put a butterfly net over fairy world.  that fairy godkid has been nothing but trouble.  yeah, megan always was a bad seed.  i was talking about timmy. who's megan.  guys, we got to get to that control panel.  but how.   i've got three letters for you, megan bacon.  blt.   we did it. fairy world is saved.  and we all got blts.  ..  ah, bacon grease.   there's the monster who's behind all this.  you're still talking about timmy, aren't you.  duh. ooh, sandwich bozos.  thank goodness you guys are okay.  now, i wish i had never interfered with megan's life and everything was back to normal.  my wish worked.  megan's lair turned back into the cake 'n bacon.  oh, no. timmy, she's back.  welcome to the cake 'n bacon.  cake and bacon and bacon and cake.  i'll have cake and bacon.  i'll also have cake and bacon.  i'll have the veal. we don't have that.  oh, no.  timmy must've screwed up the past.  to the earl of veal.  cake and bacon for everyone.  well, timmy, i hope you learned your lesson.  oh, why do i even bother saying that anymore.  i'm sorry, wanda.  i guess i really messed up your anniversary.  oh, don't beat yourself up, timmy.  the point is, everything is back to normal.  i just have one question.  when sparky brought erg, ben, and the earl back from the past, wouldn't that mess something up.  honey, i'm gonna play with my world of tiny people now.  i'm gonna go drop this building on tiny dinkleberg.   aha.  oof.  weee.  slurp. mmmmmm.  cinnamon. milk. cinnamilk.  cinnamon toast crunch.  part of this good breakfast slurp.  cinnamilk.  watch as these magnificent creatures take flight, soaring away from home, towards the promise of a better existence.  but these birds are suffering.  because this better place turned out to have an unreliable cell phone network, and the videos on their little bird phones kept buffering.  birds hate that.  so theycame back home.  because they get $300 for switchingback to verizon.  and so can you.  verizon, come hometo a better
