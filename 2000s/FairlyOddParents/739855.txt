 dad: hey, short stuff, want to spend today playing catch with your old man in the park.  you bet.  then, boy, then are you gonna be disappointed because your mom and i are out of here.  we're going to the cake and bacon.  ..  but we're not hungry yet, so we'll wait in the car.  but so you won't be lonely while we're gone, we hired vicky to babysit.  and i can't wait for my special alone time with timmy.  i will now hide inside my own pants.  presto.  you're not hiding anywhere.  you have chores to do.  how bad could it be.    you should've tried hiding in your pants.   vicky: twerp, get out here.  wow. vicky seems extra mean today.  why can't i make her nice.  oh, you can, timmy, but there's repercussions.  all that mean has to go somewhere, you know.  don't care. i wish vicky was nice.   i always knew something evil must've crawled up there.  can't be corn, 'cause corn is nice.   hungry yet.  nope.   why, timothy, you poor thing.  you've been attacked by a door.  follow menay. i shall carry you.  i made you muffins, knit you this ottoman, wrote thank you notes for all the birthday gifts you've received since you were born.  you're temperature's normal and your cholesterol's fine.  i want you to relax and play mindless video games while i run and do those nasty chores, you precious imp of a boy.  mmwah.  wow. nice vicky rocks.  she even used the right thermometer.  there's a first time for everything.  i know. come on.  let go see how nice nice vicky is.  wow, if she keeps this up,  nice, nice, nicey, nice    nicety nice, she's oh so nice    nicety nice, she's

and look at this.  vicky: timmy.  i copper repiped the house, prechewed your moccasin leather soft, and beaded a timely hygiene reminder onto this throw pillow.  now i'm off to donate blood and organs and dig basements for needy people with nowhere to put their bumper pool tables.  hey, these aren't bad.  man, without that bug in her butt, vicky's great.  where'd that evil bug go, anyway.  now i'm hungry. let's go.  well, are you ready for a nice dinner.    no, but i am ready for a big, nasty, evil dinner.    according to my wand, that bug is still out there.  and corn stocks are up.  according to the evil bug addendum in the rules, the bug doesn't just go away.  it looks for a new host.  well, as long as it doesn't inhabit anyone i know, it's not my problem.   hello.  oh, dear, we're at the cake 'n' bacon.  your father's turned inexplicably evil.  dad:.  so we might be a little late.  now it's my problem. don't move.  must commit evil deeds.  must give lousy tip under 15%.  and then i'll send my meal back even though it's exactly what i ordered.   mom, don't ask why, but i have to stick this up dad's pants.  ooh, is it father's day already.  mindeoof.   ..we're at the cake 'n' bacon.  are we at least being nice.  oh, no.  the bug's on the move.  we've got to find it before it gets into someone more powerful and influential than my dad.  hi, principal waxleplax.  what's the most powerful and influential educator in dimmsdale doing at the cake 'n' bacon.  why, eating bacon, of course.  remember, i'm frosting intolerant.  oh, no. the bug.  it's going after the knee/thigh of my principal.  come on, timmy, let's go celebrate father's day at home.  oh, goody, you've got the net.  butbutbut come on. come on.  i gotta get to principal waxleplax.  what's the hurry, turner.  ants in your pants.  uh, not my pants.  principal: good morning, students.  as you know, you are all invited to watch the president.  but guess what: i'll be going alone.  you're all getting preventative detention for bad things i think you might do.   no, i can't be locked in a room with children.  i'm not a people person.  i'm barely a person.  help.  the bug's using waxleplax to get close to the president.  got your speech. yep.  got your tie.  yep.  ..got your button you can push and destroy the world if you were to somehow become inexplicably evil.  when don't i.  what do you think of the new look.  very retro, sir.  that bug's gonna bite the most powerful man on the planet.  carl the corn farmer.  he has total power over corn.  this is my fault.  i'm the one who unleashed it.  i wish i could leave this room inconspicuously.  yaaa.  it means without being noticed.  well, if he wasn't screaming, he wouldn't have been noticed.  hey, turner exploded.  that's one less mouth to teach.  man:..  mayor for life. mayor for life.  you got to read those ballots, people.  but without further ado, it is my pleasure to introduce the most powerful man on the planet: the president of the united states.   i told you they'd like the new look.  boo.  hiss. boo.   oh. oh, timmy.  is it father's day already.  gotta stop that bug.  darling, timmy, care for a homebaked crescent roll i rescued from the cake 'n' bacon.  i have to save the president from the ultimate evil.  ..  and i can't let you do anything dangerous.  i'm your loving, nice babysitter.  let me go.  i have to keep an 8legged manifestation of ultimate evil away from the president's butt.   an evil butt bug.  i can't let timmy play with anything that ..  or that close to a butt.  i'm a babysitter.  citizens of dimmsdale, iwhereah. thank you. that's better.  ..  i wish i had really cool bughunting gear.  it's extermination time.   closer. closer.  gotcha.  suction cup.  aah.  get away from the nice president, you evil bug.  take me, instead.    ooh.  aah.  vicky.  vicky, speak to me.  say something nice. anything nice.  ..i...twerp.  vicky, you're back to normal, which is bad. security.  aah.  get off me. aah.  twerp.  evil bugs, babysitters that attack presidents, what kind of rathole town do you have here.  well, this seems like a real good news/ bad news moment.  the bad news is vicky's back to normal, but the good news is that she's been taken to a secret government location for questioning.  and the good news is the president has a whole new look.  and the bad news is he left his button, and i don't know what it does.  cosmo, no.  oh, no. we blew up pluto.  he didn't say which world it blew up.  who cares. it's pluto.  both: hey, that's not nice.  that's where i keep my corn.  and corn is niiice.  dad: oh, goody. you've got the net.  fruitsnackia.  @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ ultimateadventure pets.  explore the beach, meet

why the long face.  and why the long teeth. oh, right. genetics.  i have to build a miniature golf course in one week or i'm gonna flunk.  principal waxleplax: welcome, junior business leaguers.  where's your business project, timmy.  uh, at my house.  oh. keeping it a secret, eh.  give me a clue. give me a clue.  that'd be a little rough.  "little" as in tiny and "rough" as in a golf course.  it's a miniature golf course, isn't it.  i love minigolf. i can't wait to play.  i'll bring all the teachers. fore.  and any other adults who could punish you if you're lying.  and you're gonna build it instead of wishing for it.  oh, that's great, timmy.  no, that's stupid.  i wish i had a super cool miniature golf course.  yay, laziness.  hey, what gives.  it's a special edition of thewand street journal.  look.  what arehuh. we're in fairy world.  fairies: huh.  oh. aah.  jorgen, what's going on here.  the pixies bought fairy world in a hostile takeover.  which, although it has the word "hostile" in it, was much less fun than it sounds.   why can't i just make wishes anymore.  well, timmy, pixies are just as magical as fairies, but they treat magic just like a business.  and they have horrible taste in hats.  but you know all about that, timmy.  at least it's not pink.  and as of today, all wishes must now be submitted in writing.  these pixies are not as freespirited as we fairies are.  what. you think i am not freespirited.  that i'm incapable of whimsy.  i will prove my whimsy when i change you into aaw, weinerschnitz.  oh, man, it's true.  i can't just wish for stuff anymore.  but i gotta get my miniature golf course built.  i'm gonna register a complaint.  i'm mr. sanderson. and you are.  turner. timmy turner.  if you don't recognize me, it's probably the hat.  cosmo, we've been waiting for you.  you wanted upstairs right away for your personnel review, where we'll be combing over every excruciating detail of your past performance.  past performances.  oh, no. they're going to fire cosmo.  why. he hasn't done anything that bad.  head pixie: sunk the city of atlantis, caused an invasion of super intelligent roaches, and, of course, super toilet.  aah. so much clogging.  to keep the fairies in line, we need to make them think they're still important.  we need an idiot to give a job with a fancy title to who won't be any threat to us.  and i suspect cosmo could be that idiot.  roger that. i'm super positive.  both:.  actually, it's rice president.  yep. that's rice all right.  and they gave me my own personal assistant.  uh, do not think that my taking a day job means that i'm not freespirited.  look how i have personalized my work space with this poster and my collection of flipsy toys.  cosmo, this isn't like you at all.  i know. it's better. don't worry.  nothing will change except now i'm your boss and all wishes have to be submitted in triplicate.  oh, and today is casual friday.  i take my coffee with 2 sugars, and don't put any rice in it because i'll know.  it's my department.  wanda, where have you been.  working on your super cool miniature golf course wish.  awesome. and.  rejected for being too much fun.  not awesome.  ah, there you are, wanda.  quit dawdling.  rice while you're at it.  sorry about your miniature golf course wish being rejected.  i was really surprised.  the head pixie loves golf. bogey.  hmm. he does, does he.  too bad my miniature golf course isn't done.  you could suck up to the boss by bringing him here for a free round of golf.  hey. i just had a great idea.  i'm gonna grant your wish and bring the head pixie here for a free round of golf.  dude, where's your wand.  ha ha ha. no, we don't use those anymore.  .  the turner kid wants to play you in minigolf.  oh, you can take him, no problem.  he wears a pink hat. he's a pushover.  he says you're on.  that is definitely not rice.  ugh. how does he do it.  head pixie: top notch course, cosmo.  top notch.  hey, what do you say we make this game a little more interesting.  if i win, i get one free wish.  and if h.p. wins.  yes, what ifiwin. what happens then, punk.  i give up my fairies.  you can reassign them to something more businessy and less fun.  antifun. i like it.  although i'll have you know i've never lost a game of golf ever.  i'm magic.  i've got a rave to get to.  that's a hole in one for timmy.  don't worry, h.p. you can take him.  i've got the music in me.  that's a hole in one for the head pixie.  .  i'm only cheering so i can keep my power over rice.  cosmo: timmy's ahead by 2 strokes.  timmy, you need a hole in one to win.  are you nervous.  nah.  even though if you miss this putt you'll never see us again and fairy world will be ruined forever.  now i'm nervous. those pixies are cheating.  you have to help me.  at least make it fair.  but, timmy, he's my boss.  my pointyheaded boss who gave me this cell phone with this super cool polyphonic ring.   oh, sweetie, what's more important.  your job or the people you love.  um, define love.  unh.  i rock. out loud.   well, he may not be the perfect side dish, but he is my godkid.  ahahchoo.  all:  in your face, meat.  first the rice, now this.  did you see that, sir.  cosmo reacted in a negative fashion.  in the face of your powerful victory.  is this true.  i love my ricebased position, and i love the ability to boss my wife around, but i love being timmy's fairy godparent even more.  that's really touching, cosmo, ..you're fired.  but i just approved my assistant's whimsy wish.  hey. look at me.  freespirited as a young schoolgirl bouncing on a pogo stick, the ultimate freespirited device of all time.  ha ha ha. ha ha ha.  ha ha ha. fear my whimsy. whoa.  pixies: aah.  ow. i'm all right.  nobody worry about meee.  hole in one.  timmy wins.  you owe me one wish.  i think you know what i want, mr. head pixie.  i wish the fairies owned fairy world again.  approved.  fairies: yay. woo.  yay.  yay.  yay. ha ha ha.  my biceps. i can see them.  no.  pixies: no.  way to go, cosmo.  thanks, timmy.  um, can i still boss you around. no.  can you at least make me some rice.  well, it is the perfect side dish.  like me.  i'm proud of you, sport, for building your own course.  i don't think it's gonna get you much extra credit, though.  fore.  all: aah.  at this point, i'm just sort of hoping it doesn't get me expelled.  like the pixies got expelled from fairy world.  hey, i wonder where they all ended up.  jorgen said he had the perfect job for those pointyheaded freaks.  jorgen: i told you i would find the perfect place in my organization for you pointyheaded freaks.  you can only imagine the joy i feel in my heart right now.  captioning made possible byenepartmen :wh.ch.   2dseoe  b:moons.  hour g0es @hz(] @p :4ch 9.erp0wbh0pz od breakp0.  male announcer: an alien armada has arrived and invaded our planet.  wave
