dicaprio.  and this is my assistant, bucky.  i can talk.  no one cares.  you must be the renowned magician the astounding timmy's dad.  ooh, no, it's the amazing timmy's dad, familiarlooking stranger.  dad, that's mr. crocker.  nonsense, son.  this man is denzel dicaprio, "bigtime hollywood agent and not a fifthgrade " what can i do for you, mr. dicarpet odor.  i mean, besides amaze you.   make you rich and famous.  i've arranged a tour where you'll perform your magic before adoring crowds all across the nation.  ooh, great.  can my family go too.  hold it, dad.  crocker, i don't know what you're up to, but we're not going anywhere with you.  kids on magic tours don't have to go to school.  we're in.          denzel dicaprio's office.  bucky the speaking rabbit speaking.  give me that.  dicaprio speaking.  yes, i represent the amazing timmy's dad.  you want to put him on national television.  .. peachy keen.  you hear that, bucky.  my plan is working like a charm.  tomorrow night, i'll expose timmy's dad as afairy to the world.  ..  i'm not crazy.  you're talking to a rabbit.  what's your point, weirdo.  national tv, the bigtime.  soon everyone will know the name the amazing timmy's dad.  yay.  but i'm not the amazing timmy's dad anymore.  i'm dadbracadabra, brain freak.   whoo.  dadbracadabra.  and for my first trick, i'm going to learn to walk in these supertight jeans.  yes, you do that.  in the meantime, i'll be on the stage, setting up the cameras that will expose you as a fairy.  i mean, to a wider audience.  ooh, guys, isn't it exciting.  dicapriodor is going to make me rich and famous.  and i'll be able to hire someone to lug this heavy trunk full of rabbits.  crack.  and fix my spine.  so what are you going to pull out of your hat on tv, dad.  oh, no hat tricks, timmy.  i'm going to take it up a notch by performing a deathdefying escape act.  check it.  i step inside this trunk, which will be chained shut by my new assistant, the amazing timmy's mom.  you mean mamagician.  the trunk will then move down a conveyor belt into a bunch of superscary, razorsharp saws.  and right before i get chopped into tiny pieces, i will magically escape and say: tada.  i'm on my way, mr. dicaffeinated.  sport, don't you think your dad's getting a little carried away.  that trick sounds awfully dangerous.  so what. he's got magic now.  and i've got a tv, video games, and no school.  timmy, all we gave him is a magic hat.  that's not going to help him survive some deathdefying escape trick.  well, that's easy to fix.  i wish my dad had the power to do his deathdefying escape trick.  consider your dad safe.  ladies and gentlemenand rabbits.  i now present dadbracadabra.    sweetie, you have life insurance, right.  yeah.  okey dokey.   as soon as turner's dad finishes his stupid trick, you will ride out on your unicycle and tear off his shirt.  then everyone will see hisfairy wings and know that i've been right all along ..  fairies.  not to mention talking rabbits.  oh, let it go.  now, shut your rabbit hole and wait for your cue.  so that's what mr. crocker's been up to.  he thinks my dad is a fairy.  ha. how stupid is that.  ha ha, yeah.  ..  cosmo, what did you do.  well, it was one minute ago.  timmy wished his dad had the power to escape that trick, so i gave him the full fairy package: unlimited magic, the ability to fly, ..  no, don't say it.  fairy wings.  together: cosmo.  what's the big deal.  i'll just change him back.  no.  if you take away dad's powers, he'll be cut to pieces.  but if you don't, crocker will show everyone my dad has fairy wings.  and government scientists will cut your dad to pieces.  boy, timmy, you really messed up this time.     there's only one solution.   eh.  brain freak.   time for some payback.  i wish my dad wasn't a fairy anymore and mr. crocker was.  aha.  yewhahuhwha.  where are the fairy wings.  what the look, everyone.  mr. dicaprio's a fairy.  what. no, i'm not.  oh, no.  there's only one explanation for this.  fairieshave turned me into afairy.  look, he really is a fairy.  and he needs to work out.  you try joining a gym on a teacher's salary.  let's make him grant our wishes.  let's stuff him in a sack and sell him to government scientists.  let's make him put his shirt back on.    that was amazing, dad.  i'm so proud of you.  but i guess you'll be going on the road permanently now.  oh, no, timmy.  i'm done with magic.  all i wanted was for you to be proud of me.  besides, these supertight jeans cut off the blood to my brain.  oh, joy.  being a fairy is the best thing ever.  i can fly.  i'm magic.  nothing can hurt me now.  i almost forgot.  i wish mr. crocker wasn't a fairy anymore.   honey.  mr. dicappuccino is in our garbage.  .  om nom nom pzrw
