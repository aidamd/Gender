  aah.  morning, everyone.  ooh, i see poof is ready for his big day.  i'm still not sure he's old enough to be on his own.  it is going to be a snap, wanda.  most of the job will consist of polishing crocker's dentures and poofing up soft foods.  come on, poof.  it's time to meet your fairy god geezer.  well, it's time for me to go too, wanda.  i'm gonna spend my life on the run like an edible desperado.  oh, cosmo, just change back into yourself.  i would, but sparky took a bite out of my memory and i can't remember what i used to be.  mother, i'm off to school. goodbye.  hopefully forever. here's your lunch, denzel.  have a good day. i love you.  if you loved me, you wouldn't have packed head cheese.   excuse me, mrs. crocker. oh, oh.  stranger danger.   oh, oh, i'm terribly sorry.  you must be my date from that online matchmaking service i signed up for, wrinkled romance.  uh, not exactdon't say a word unless it's about your biceps.  finally, somebody gets me.  anyway, i came from fairy world to give you the greatest gift a mortal can receive.  a fondue set.  yesno. your own fairy godparent.  ..  poof. poof poof.  ooh. i have a fairy godparent.  and it's a cute floating head with chubby little legs.  yes and he will grant your every wish.  but first, there are two main rules you need to follow: you cannot use magic to cheat, and you cannot tell anyone you have a fairy.  now, how about a test wish.   it worked.  my "hunky man with a fondue set" wish came true.  get your mind out of the gutter, woman.  good luck, poof.  this is so exciting.  my next wish is to look exactly like i did when i was 21.  poof poof.  oh, my goodness. i'm beautiful.  now that i'm a knockout, i want to fulfill all my other dreams.  first, i want to be able to pull a bus with my teeth.    well, that was one weird ride to school.  poof, i'm ready for my next wish.  i've always wanted to eat a cake in the future.  poof poof. no, i'm not kidding.    enjoy some cake.   this future cake is delicious.  the best part is that i can eat as much as i want and still stay trim in the past.  here is your check.  you must pay 7,000 government credits or spend 20 years in work camp nine.  i wish i had a laser rabbit.  okay, poof.  now i wish i was home watching my favorite tv show.  welcome back to another " today we're dipping this grilled cheese sandwich in a boiling pot of chocolate.  look, wanda, i'm on tv. yay, chocolate.  aah.  this is perfect, poof.  but you know what i wish for most of all.  to spend more time with denzel.  what am i doing here.  not academy awardwinning actor denzel washington.  my son, denzel crocker.  aah. what happened.  i was right in the middle of breaking up a food fight in the cafeteria.  it was me against the entire school.  ooh, that little becky wangberg has quite an arm on her.  denzel, there's something i need to tell you.  i know denzel washington and i have magic now.  what.  i believe the denzel washington thing, but the magic thing is just plain crazy.  it's true.  ..ly magical pillow.  you really expect me to believe that you holy couch accessory. you weren't kidding.  i guess you can get anything on the internet these days.  listen, denzel, i feel like we've been drifting apart, so i want to make a very special wish.  oh, please don't let it be that you want us to spend more time together.  i want us to spend more time together.  remember when you were a kid and we used to run errands.  i wish we would have a day like that all over again.  that's not gonna happen.  okay, it happened, and it's humiliating.  oh, admit it, denzel. you had fun.  fun. it was a nightmare.  first you made me get braces again, then my old barber put a bowl on my head to cut my hair.  it still had cereal in it.  and now i'm dressed like a turn of the century dandy.  you look adorable.  oh, denzel, what a perfect day. i love you.  now don't you have something you want to say to me.  oh, i have something to say all right, but i have a little too much dignity.  now if you'll excuse me, i'm gonna hike up my knee socks, pick the corn out of my braces and skip all the way home.  lalalalala.   oh, poof, my son just doesn't want to spend time with me anymore.  i guess i'll have to fill the hole in my heart with superficial material possessions.  i wish for diamonds, a mink coat, a jaguar not that kind of a jaguar.   oh, i'm allergic to jungle cats.  now i wish i had a doctor.  hello, doctor gorgeous.  i've got a disease and you're the cure.  i'm writing you a prescription for "get real," lady.  poof, i'm just gonna have to keep making wishes until i feel better. now, let's get wishing.    poof poof.  oh, poof, i've been making wishes for hours, but i still feel empty inside.  i don't think a glazed ham is gonna help.  anyway, it's 8:00.  that's three hours past my bed time.  phew.  while i'm asleep, i want you to keep granting this list of wishes.  maybe we can find something that'll make me feel better.    unh.  that woman is overworking poof.  he's been gone all night.  wanda, i'm sure poof is fine.  poof poof.  or not so fine. oh, my baby.  crocker, she's gonna be toast.  being toast isn't that bad, wanda.  it's having a delicious cheesy center that gets you into trouble.  that's what i get for hiding in a husky kid's lunch box.  i'm much safer here at home. mm.  chocolate toast with a delicious cheesy center.  aah.  i need to find a place to hide where no one will eat me.  i've got it.  next to your dad's bowl of tomato soup.   timmy, i'm never letting poof go over to mrs. crocker's house again.  good news.  crocker's house again.  what. poof poof.  poof has done a great job.  well, other than the complaint from academy awardwinning actor denzel washington.  anyway, the fairy council has decided to assign him to mrs. crocker permanently.  it is time to go back to fairy godparenting.  ahh.  jorgen, you can't be serious.  that woman is running poof ragged.  there's gotta be some way to get poof out of this.  no, there is not.  crocker breaks the rules.  anyway, there is nothing i can do.  poof will never come home again.  now if you'll excuse me, i have to write a letter of apology to denzel washington's agent.  this is terrible, timmy.  i'll never see my baby again.  minions, now on select fruitsnackiaproducts.  rated pg.  aha.  oof.  weee.  slurp. mmmmmm.  cinnamon. milk. cinnamilk.  cinnamon toast crunch.  part of this good breakfast slurp.  cinnamilk.  .  unlike ordinary diapers, pampershas three absorbent layers to stay up to three times drier.  so your baby can sleep soundly all night.  wishing you love,sleep and play.  pampers this is terrible, timmy.  we've gotta figure out some way to get poof away from mrs. crocker and bring him back home.  don't worry, wanda. i've got a plan.  crocker to break the rules.  and when it comes to breaking rules, i'm an expert.  oh, i love to break rules.  don't tell anyone, but i once parked in a loading zone with nothing to load.  wow, wanda, that's not exactly whaand one time i left a 14% tip at a restaurant, but i felt so guilty, i broke into the waiter's house ..  which, i'll point out, is also breaking the rules.  well, technically it's breaking and entering.  of course, i did leave the waiter 20 bucks to fix the window i broke.  i also did his dishes, but i did not dry them.  and that was right after i snuck my own popcorn into a movie theater.  okay, wanda, i get it. you're a rebel.  listen, one of the rules is you can't cheat.  mrs. crocker plays bingo every day.  if we can get her to use magic to win, she'll lose poof.  now here's the plan.  poof, it's great having you at bingo with me.  with you here, i can wish for anything i need.  like a yummy liverwurst sandwich.  poof poof.  and cut the crust off.  just on three sides.  no, that's not the side i like with crust.  oh, that's perfect.   that's delicious.  i'll just save the rest for later.  unh.  now i could use some bunion cream, a donut cushion for my tushy, and one of those fancy electric nose trimmers.  you're a life saver.    hey, poof.  hello, ladies.  are you new to bingo.  oh, i've been playing bingo for about 50,000 i mean, 50 years.  watch the elbow, bernice.  so how long does this bingo thing last.  i've got a soccer game this afternoon.   did i say soccer game.  i meant hip replacement surgery.  well you're here on a good day.  first prize is new tennis balls for your walker.  what. that's a super lame prize.  i mean, score.  i'm an old lady who needs that.  if you want to win, you should do what i do.  that's what i do all the time.  i'm a big fat cheater.  you're not cheating in here, honey.  watch the rebel get out of this scrape.  how about i slip you a quarter and we forget this whole thing.  tase her, dano.  aah.   bingo jail. who knew.  gladys dug a tunnel.  we're busting out at midnight. hey, hey.  you might want to whisper that.  i thought i was.  i lost my hearing aid in a rumble in the mess hall.  you two are free to go.  you were bailed out by a grilled cheese sandwich.  sandwich. aah.  aah.  aah. watch the crust.   wanda, we need to find a new way to get mrs. crocker to break the rules.  i know, we'll get her to break the biggest rule ever.  get her to leave a 14% tip.  no.  let's get her to tell someone she has a fairy.  and i know just how to do it.   hello, we are government census takers.  we're here to find out how many men, women, and fairies are living in your house.  one woman and one humped back man, and that's it.  thank you. are you sure.  it's okay to tell us any secrets you're keeping.  you can trust us. we're the government.  come on. everybody has secrets.  for example, my husband's a grilled cheese sandwich.  i have a lot of wishing to doi mean, hip replacement surgery.  nice going, wanda.  you were more believable as bernice.  you were bernice. wake up, poof.  you have a lot of wishes to grant.  here's my new list.    . .  seriously, old woman, i will poof up a restraining order right now.  we need another plan, wanda. wanda.   wanda.  i'm taking her out, timmy.  i'm not going back to jail with you.  now get out here.   i've been thinking, wanda.  people get fairy godparents because they're unhappy.  all we have to do is find out what's making mrs. crocker sad and fix it.  then poof will be free to go.  that's a great idea, timmy.  but how are we ever gonna figure out what makes her unhappy.   i'm home, you old bat.  i was just about to makeyourself scarce. the scarcer the better.  ..don't.    that's it, wanda.  crocker's unhappiness.  he's the reason she got a fairy.  if we get rid of him, poof can come home.  timmy turner.  uh, mr. crocker, what brings you here.  it's my house.  okay, enough small talk.  i was thinking if you hate your mother so much, you should just leave home.  i took the liberty of packing a bag for you.  that's mighty thoughtful of you, turner.  and a little bit creepy. i like it.  by the way, what are you doing in myi have to go to the bathroom. wanda.  never mind.  a toilet just appeared on the lawn.   crocker is gone, crocker is gonna be happy now.  denzel, did you leave a bear trap in my room again.  he's not here, mrs. crocker.  in fact, i don't think he's coming back.  timmy turner. uh, mrs. crocker.  what brings you here. it's my house.  crocker asked me to tell you that he's gone forever.  isn't that the best news you've ever heard.  what. no.  that's the worst news i've ever heard.   why.  i don't understand.  i thought mr. crocker made you miserable.  miserable. he's my son and i love him.  i'm just sad because he doesn't love me back.  what are you talking about, mother.  mr. crocker, why'd you come back.  i needed to wash my hands, and there's no lawn sink.  now what's all this about me not loving you.  well you don't.  at least, you never say you do.   of course i love you, you deranged lunatic.  you're my mommy. oh, denzel.  enough, mother.  you're getting denture cream on my shirt.  you've made me the happiest woman on earth.  come on, i'll buy you an ice cream, your treat.  and you're paying for gas. oh, denzel.  uh, what just happened.   i will tell you what happened.  as creepy and unbelievable as it sounds, she actually wanted to spend time with mr.  crocker.  and now that she is no longer miserable, she doesn't need a fairy.  poof, you can go home.  poof poof. oh, i have my baby back.  let's go find your father so we can go out to dinner and celebrate.  ooh, a sandwich.  jorgen, that was cosmo.  nope, wanda. the sandwich was a decoy.  i got tired of people trying to eat me, so i cleverly disguised myself as a delicious dog bone.  ooh. dog bone.  oh, no.  watch the crust.  poof it's so good to have you back home.  poof poof.  poof, here is your pay for being a fairy godparent.  wait a minute.  you guys get paid for being godparents.  of course not, timmy.  spending time with you is all the pay we need.  i assume my money is being directly wired to my offshore account as usual.  wait a minute. what about my money.  actually, we have to pay them for you to be a godparent.  that's fair.  let's celebrate us being back together with a fun night at bingo.  they banned us there, remember, wanda.  they'll never let us back in.  i'll sneak us in, timmy.  i'm a rebel, remember.  you had to park in the loading zone, didn't you, bernice.  you're bernice.  don't worry, guys.  word has it that gladys is breaking us out tonight.  how's that tunnel coming, gladys.  pretty good.  i just gotta pick up my shovel so i can start digging.    oh, my back.  i got this.  what do you say we blow this taco stand.  ooh, speaking of which, poof, make me a taco.  taco.  aah. i'm gonna need that piece back.  oh, i love spending time with you, denzel.  we should do this every day.  stop smothering me, you pushy old bat.  cuckoo court now in session.  your honor, you've gotta keep cocoa puffs away from me.  ..but why.  .. and they make me go cuckoo.  ..crunchy...  ..cocoa puffs.  chocolate in the court.  see, i'm cuckoo for cocoa puffs, cuckoo for cocoa puffs.  cocoa puffs has the ultimate chocolatey taste that turns everything chocolatey ...even the milk. chocolatey cocoa puffs, part of a good breakfast.  i find you guilty. totally delicious.  are you ready, kids.  kids: aye, aye, captain.  i can't hear you.  aye, aye, captain.  . ooh. .  . who lives in a pineapple under the sea.  .  .spongebob squarepants..  . absorbent and yellow and porous is he .  .spongebob squarepants..  . if nautical nonsense be something you wish .  .spongebob squarepants..  . then drop on the deck and flop like a fish .  .spongebob squarepants.. ready.  . spongebob squarepants. .  . spongebob squarepants. .  . spongebob squarepants. .  . spongebob squarepants. .     so, i was all ready to drain the fries, but i cooked the fries slightly too long.  so...  spongebob... so here's where the bizarre twist comes in.  spongebob... they weren't overcooked at all.  spongebob. look.  spongebob: wow.  what happened to the krusty krab.  mr. krabs: good morning.  the krusty towers is now open for business.  why did you build a hotel, mr. krabs.  i'm glad you asked, son.  remember when i went to that fast food convention and stayed in that fancy hotel.  i had a beautiful room.  the employees were so friendly.  they catered to me every whim, no matter how demeaning it was, because they lived by a code.  and that code was engraved in fine gold above the grand fireplace.  everything was perfect.  until i got the bill.  they charged me for everything.  $25.00 for a hamburger.   if they could charge that much for a lousy burger, imagine how much i could charge for a lousy krabby patty.  and thus, the krusty towers was born.  why would anyone stay at a hotel in bikini bottom.  it's in the middle of scenic nowhere.  there's nothing to do but get stung by jellyfish.   see. eww.  come inside.  isn't it beautiful.  where are all the new hotel employees.  me first hotel guest.  watch me reel him in.  welcome to the krusty towers, where our motto is, "we shall never deny a guest even the most ridiculous request." oh, that's great.  i'd like a double krabby patty with no onions and extra pickles.  if you want a krabby patty, you have to rent a room, and order room service.  ooh, i've only got an hour for lunch.  boy, you reeled that one in like a pro.  okay, squidward, you run the front desk.  i'd like a krabby patty, please.  this is a hotel now.  if you want a krabby patty, you'll have to get a room, and order room service.  okay. one krabby patty and one room.  with cheese.  oh, and can i get cheese on the krabby patty, too.  patrick, you only live 400 yards away.  why do you want to check into a hotel.  sometimes i just need to get away from it all.  wow, this hotel has everything.  give me that.  now sign the register.  i didn't know there would be a test.  i didn't study.  patrick, all you have to do is write your name.  oh, okay. )
