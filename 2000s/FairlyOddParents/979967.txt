house in order to obtain new friends.  yes. ah. your witness.  hi, timmy, look. i'm a lawyer.  now i'm a fireman. wheee.  now i'm just a simple fairy/lawyer/fireman, but jorgen misses the point.  there are many redeeming qualities to timmy.  isn't it true that you also wished for new shoes, new sunglasses, butlers and shiny teeth.  yes.  wow, what a selfish punk.  the defense rests.  .  i'm a fireman, not a laser technician.  nowi'm a laser technician.  one last question.  after bestowing all these wonderful things upon you, did you ever once thank your fairy godparents.  ..i guess i
