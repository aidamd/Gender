 and where there are kids there are bound ..  fairy godparents.  mr. crocker, what have you done.  approximately $1,800 worth of damage, but fear not, geraldine. i can fix it.  i'm your boss now. call me miss waxelplax.  and how do you propose to fix my car.  once i capture a fairy godparent, i'll wish your car back to normal.  fairies.  timmy: wow.  even 10 years ago, crocker's still miserable and fairyobsessed.  we have to go back in time further.  to the eighties.   we're at dimmsdale university in the eighties.  this must be where crocker went to college.  timmy: this whole decade is a fashion disaster.  i'm gonna stick out like a sore thumb.  wanda: there you go.  now you're practically invisible.  and funky fresh.  come on, kiddie, let's break dance.   gnarly.  geraldine: denzel, the whole university is abuzz with big news.  ah, geraldine.  i'm glad you're here to see this.  after spending 4 years in college on my research, i'm finally ready to share my discovery with the world.  big news today.  big news means big messes.   dad: wow. she's a maniac, that's for sure.  oh, let's sit here, sheldon.  i can't wait to hear the big news.  grrr, dinkleberg.   this crocker kid says his discovery is going to change the world.  i can't wait to give him funding for his research.  whatever you're paying, the government will double it.  what a scoop.  i'm phoning this in on my brandspankingnew 1980s cellular phone.  cell phone radiation so not a threat to my health.    students, faculty, esteemed guests with big, fat government checks, how would you like it if every time you wanted something, it magically appeared.  both: yes, yes, yes.  "how is this possible." you might ask.  why, with the help of fairy godparents.  yes, through many years of research, i have very nearly discovered actual proof that fairy godparents float among us.  these fairies are assigned to a child and grant their every wish.  i say we place painful monitor collars on every child in america so we can capture their fairies so that we control the magic.  ha ha ha.  well, what are you waiting for.  i'll take my money, accolades, fame, and great life now.   oh, denzel, no.  i'm in love with a psychotic moron.   why are you laughing. stop laughing.  i'm not giving the money to him.  he promised to blind us with science.  i know, i'm going to invest it in something timeless and worthwhile, like his parachute pants.  look at those pockets.  who knows what could be in them.  i'm in.  and i'm rich.  and we're through.  not to take advantage of you on the rebound, but may i mop up your tears.  bleh.  ha ha ha.  stop it. stop laughing at me.  oh, this is the secondworst day of my life.  secondworst.  then his worst day has already happened.  ..  to crocker's childhood.  here you are, sport.  dimmsdale, march 14, 1972: crocker's childhood.  but i'm

timmy: hey, it's my school in the seventies.   timmy: and there's crocker.  you were right, cosmo.  you were right.  wow, one in a row. it's a new record.  hmm.  wanda: there is something familiar
