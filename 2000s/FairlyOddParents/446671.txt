today's the day i get my perfect attendance award.  we're so proud of you.  you may not have gotten an award for grades or sports, but when it comes to showing up, you sure do show up a lot.  oh, no. francis is outside looking for me.  how do you know he's looking foryou.  it's the last day of schoo he celebrates by pounding all the guys.  hey there, francis. it's just me.  me, the girl.  not the boy that you would pound if i was a boy, which i'm not, because i'm a girl.  please, francis, no.  well, honey, anything else before we drop you off, don't look back, and pay absolutely no mind to that scary, gray child.  yeah, can you drop me offinschool.  see you later at the awards ceremony.  both: bye, timmy.   thank you for joining us today, mr. turner.    look. over there. a rottweiler.  i'm not falling for that one, turner.  you're right. it's just a brick wall.  a brick wall. where.  you know, sweetie, running away from your problems never solved anything.  turner.  but it's great cardio. run, timmy, run.  a dead end.  oh, man. if francis sees me, i'm dead.  wait. sees me. that's it.  i wish i was invisible.  cool. you can see right through me.  you're not that hard to figure out.   oh, no. francis is coming.  you two gotta hide.  i wish that you looked like school kids.  all right, turner, it's time tohey. where'd turner go.  brown hair, big teeth.  short kid, silly pink hat.  yeah.  both: never heard of him.   well, when you see him, tell him i'm gonna give him a special yearend punch.  or i'll give it to you.  oh, cool. i love presents.  timmy. timmy.  cool. i'm invisible.  that meanswell, i get to do invisible stuff.    haunted locker room.   and if you take the sum of the corners, ..  eh, it's not a lot.  aah. that noise.  it's coming from nowhere.  it's the haunted chalkboard.    haunted chalkboard. ha.  i'm not dissecting it. you dissect it.  no way, man. i'm a vegetarian.  out of the way, geeks.  this is what i'd do to turner if he was a frog.  nobody does that to my friends as long as i can't be seen defending them.  hey, pick on someone your own species.  ooh. ow. ouch. ow.  are you seeing what i'm seeing.  the ghost frog beating up francis. yeah.  both: awesome.  both: ghost frog. the school is haunted.   that child with the overactive pituitary is getting beaten up by a floating frog.  yay.  but wait. frogs don't float or beat up children.  there's only one logical explanation.  timmy turner has wished himself invisible with the help of his fairy godparents.  ..fairies.  ..crazy.  i'll show them that fairies do exist.  i'll show them all.   wow. being invisible rocks.  with the help of my heatseeking fairy goggles, i'll be able to find this invisible boy.  but where to look. where to look.  mr. crocker.  what do you think you're doing.  principal waxelplax.  i'm just hunting fairies.  knock it off, crocker.  i don't want anything freaking out the children during the awards ceremony.  both boys: aaaah.  ghost frog.  haunted locker room.  haunted chalkboard.  too late.  oh, my gosh.  i totally forgot about the ceremony.  if i don't show up in person, i won't get my award.  and i can't show up if i'm invisible.  gotta find cosmo and wanda.  there they are. and they're spaniards.  donde esta el queso apestoso.  aqui.   tengo un puerco en mis chones.  .  si.  then you get extra credit.   extra credit.  uhoh. crocker.  timmy.  magic vision goggles. he can see me.  i gotta get out of here.  i got you now, turner.  fairies. fairies. fairies.  blast. missed.   oh, no. it's 5:30.  i'm gonna miss the ceremony.   do we pay taxes for ghosts. no.  i love awards ceremonies.  i've never missed one.  hey. i've got perfect attendance like timmy.  good thing the ghosts can't reach us in the car.   it's not like him to dodge things.   you know, once i capture you, you little ghost boy, i will finally be able to prove that fairies do exist.   if i can just keep as quiet as a mouse.  turner. oh, no.  now i have you.  gotta get to the awards ceremony.  good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls.  and welcome to the awards ceremony.  ooh.    ..let's begin anyway.  i think i'll pick up the bestdressed award.  what do you think, steve.   well, i can't find turner.  you know whatthatmeans.  ..it means you and i are gonna be best friends, and you won't kill me or my pet pig steve.  we gotta find timmy before it's too late.  with my supersonic bat sonar, i'll be able to find timmy even though he's invisible.  timmy.  wanda.  boy, am i glad to see you.  oh, i wish i could say the same.  you're still invisible.  i don't know what to do.  if i wish myself visible, francis will kill me.  and if you don't.  then i don't get my award.  and cosmo gets hit because i'm being a coward.  and that's not fair.  could the day get any worse.  turner.  oh, yeah. there's that.  and now, for our final award.  the much sought after perfect attendance award.  whoo.  please be timmy. please be timmy.  oh, bless his little lungs.  he's probably so nervous he can't even breathe.  ..even...breathe.  ha ha. i've got you now, invisible boy.  ha ha ha ha.  what thea bat.  that's right.  i'm sorry, timmy. would you like a swing.  no, i'm good. continue.  instead of facing my fears, ..  all at the expense of those who really care for me.  ah, who am i kidding. i just want my award.  i wish i was visible.  and the winner of the perfect attendance ..  timmy turner.    thank you.  behold, fairy godparents do exist.  ..  an invisible boy.  oh, yeah. invisible boy.  well, this is me clapping my invisible hands.    crocker.  you're the ghost.  you covered yourself in flour to scare the students and make us think ghosts and fairies were real.  security.  crocker: no. no. no, please.  i'm not crazy. no.  he'snowait.  ow. that doesn't bend that way. aaaaaah.   i love a good opening act.  congratulations, turner.  ready for your other award.  sure. do your worst.  you're not afraid.  of course i am.  i'm just not running away from you anymore.  after my adventures today, i've learned to take more responsibility for my actions and face my fears instead of hiding behind my friends.  wow. that's pretty noble of you.  yes. yes, it is.  i'm still gonna wail on you, though.  ow.  my hand.  ow. my other hand.  ow. my head.  ow. my spleen.  well, what do you know.  it doesn't hurt to have perfect attendance.  we sure are proud of you, timmy.  yeah, and look at that neat dented medal you got.  in my day, all we got were the cruddy undented ones.  mom: anything interesting happen on

subscribe to the theory of horribly inconvenient coincidences.  i mean, look at all these awesome rides.  they can't all break down.  i'm gonna stay positive.  uh.  new theory. i'm having bad luck.  that's it.  i wish my bad luck would stop.  wanda: timmy, we're not allowed to interfere with antifairies.  well, where are they.  i don't see any antifairies here.  you can only see them with these antifairy goggles.   cosmo: stylish and functional.   hey, i can see one.  why are they picking on me.  wanda: oh, they pick on everybody, but on friday the 13th, they slip away from fairy world and cause trouble.  see.   anybody see my teeth.  yo.  that's terrible.  aaah. my back.  gadzooks.  i'm not leaving until every crack in this park is filled.  come back.  hey, you.  stop hurting my mom

over there.  and jorgen's guarding the door.  of course i am.  and if these antifairies want to get to earth, they'll have to go through me.  they already have gotten through.  not my shift.  no one is allowed in antifairy world.  then i wish they were all out here.  no.  noooo.    i want tolisten, you.  i need to have a word withwhy won't they stop.  actually, timothy, why should we.  cosmo.  i'm the antifairy cosmo.  i'm not an idiot in any manner whatsoever.  and i'm the antiwanda.  i'm incredibly stupid and eat with my feets.  anticosmo: you see,we've been trapped behind that blastedbarrier for centuries, but we knew some friday the 13th, some child would be stupid enough to have his fairies bring him here and wish all of us free.  you're our hero. our big stupid hero.  what a scoop.  oh, man. this is really bad, isn't it.  that anticosmo made me feel like an idiot.  it's not bad yet.  as long as they're here in fairy world, we can always round them up later.  hey. thin't the men's room.  you've betrayed me again.   jorgen, you have to get them back.  i will use every urg of my awesome fairy powers to shift's over. your problem.   i guess it's up to us.  you

you mean this button.  we've gotta get the antifairies back to fairy world.  how are we gonna find them.  we're not. we'll make them come to us.   the antifairies have to go where bad luck happens, right.  both: right.  let's get unlucky.  the more bad luck i cause, the more antifairies will have to come here.  and once they're here, we'll trick them back into antifairy world.  hit me.     ..  .. he's weird.  tallyho.   president, you almost caused a nucular war.  what are you gonna do next.  i'm going to escalatorland.  antiwanda: that bucktoothed punk tricked us back into fairy world.
