show's over, you're going to go have a violent chat with jorgen.  if jorgen finds me here, he'll know that he didn't wipe my memory, and i'll never get the chance to let cosmo and wanda know this wasn't my fault.  ..  those goons forgot to take my backpack.  please let there be something in here i can use.  antimagic shirt, magic slicing tie.  excellent.  jorgen: and now, put your puny hands

everything better.  aah. he's back. timmy's back.  and he's come to wreak his unholy revenge.  i'm only trying towait a minute.  how do you even know who we are.  jorgen wiped your mind.  he wiped the mind of a clone, an evil clone that norm tricked chester into wishing up.  an evil clone created by norm.  and you expect us to believe that.  and of course we do.  that explains the jerk who was running us around like slaves all morning.  actually, no.  that was me.  ..i'm sorry.  uh, guys.  this is the part where you say, "apology " maybe we don't want to, huh.  maybe we're still miffed.  apology accepted.   well, not from me. not yet.  timmy, i don't know if i believe you deserve fairies anymore.  maybe i don't.  but that doesn't mean we can let norm win, right.  ah, he's got a point.  and this is one sweet apology cookie.  aah.  norm: excuse me while i show you floating nitwits how it's done.  oh. he's going down.  but i'm still mad at you.  my cookie.   man, that was some party last night.  i can't believe chompy ate all that ice cream.  ..] bucky: what do you mean we're flat broke.  mr. mcbadbat, we're from the really big and scary government accounting office, and we're here to say you owe us a lot of money.  take everything, boys.    when our house had wheels, it never moved.  ..   like that. it stinks like that goat's breath.  man, days like this make me think i'd be happier if i lived in a mobile home.  cosmo, wanda, you are up after norm, andhey.  do i know you.  .. beaver.  ..all right.  just be sure you clean up after him.  i don't want beaver doodie on my stage.  thanks for protecting me, guys.  and when you win the contest, i'll be back and able to prove it.  but, timmy, we quit.  even if we win, we'll be assigned to the most miserable kid on earth.  but i'm miserable without you.  and we were miserable with you. right, cosmo.  don't look at me. i ate the apology cookie.  coming back in 3, 2, 1.  so, norm, i have to say, even though you are a filthy genie, you have been doing a very good job in this competition.  well, jimmy mcjarhead, i'm hoping i can go from filthy genie trapped in a lamp to idiot fairy not trapped in a lamp.  and why do you want to be a fairy godparent.  .. in song.    you are up after norm.  which one of you is singing.  which one. which one.  stupid, puny fairies, " cosmo and i are only good in a duet.  my shrill,
