"  and you two are welcome here any time.   well, what do you know.  for once, cosmo's inability to learn from his mistakes made things better.  and i'm not longer the accursed one.  nothing can ruin this day.   except a giant squid attack.    new accursed one. new accursed one.  let the new hunt begin.  uh, i think they're gonna want their medals back.  clevelanlantis, anyone.  road trip.  you

mama, it's me, cosmo. hello.  what's with him.  mama cosma's come down with a 9hour flu, and we have to go take care of her for 9 hours.  . i can't be without my fairies for 9 hours.  that's like forever.  mama's not well, so let's hurry and take care of that supervague wish.  one bodyswapping joy buzzer coming up.  awesome.  timmy, you aren't going to use this device to cheat, are you.  the fact that i'm wishing for a device that allows me to switch bodies on the day that i just so happen to have a test i haven't studied for is merely a coincidence.  what. you can't dough.  00, when mama's flu is over.  and then we'll all do something really fun and magical together, ok.  now, come on. mama needs us.  a bodyswapping joy buzzer.  thank you, mama comsa.  ok, children, it's time to do further damage to your once promising futures.  not mine. i studied.  and to that i say congratulations, a.j., old pal.  aah. aah.  : i feel different. why do my teeth feel so heavy.  timmy:'s body and he's in mine, taking my test for me. sweet.  finished.  good job.  i thought i just did this. aah.  thank you, joy buzzer.  cosmo: mama. mama. we're here, mama.  so let the insults begin.  wanda,

there, francis.  francis: why do i feel so small and my teeth feel so big.  timmy: it's time for francis to pick on someone his own size.  ooh. aah. oh.  ...  ..  no wonder they call it a joy buzzerhis pain is my joy.  what's that. a buzzer that causes joy.  you know i don't all joy or happiness.  i'm not that fond of glee, either.  but especially not joy. now, give me that.  what. no. that's mine.  timmy: ear on my neck.  oh, no. i'm crocker.  perfect vision.  teeth that could chew the bumper off a van.  i've either been turned into some super beaver or i'm timmy turner.  and this must be the work of his fairy godparents.  and now that i look like you, i can go to your house and search it for evidence of fairy godparents.  wait.  crocker, where are you going.  ..to, uh, think about how much i like you.  nonsense.  you can do that in the teacher's lounge.  ha. now off to turner's.  turner, i remember a beating, and i remember you, but i don't remember beating you, so better safe than sorry.  put me down, abnormally large child.  i'll have you suspended for this.  suspension. that's a great idea.  oh.  on one hand, i need to get home as soon as possible, on the other, i'll never get another opportunity like this.  all righty, class, today's assignment is a 500word essay on what a big, fat jerk i am.  then, for extra credit, recess all day.   always wanted to do this.  f. yeah.  mama. mama. how are you feeling, mama.  weak. i think a foot massage would help.  yeah, i'll get wanda right on that.  nonsense. you've got 6 hands.  wanda, dear, come sit with me.  you work so hard floating and everything.  your feet must be killing you.  she's so sick she thinks she likes me.  should we call a doctor.  this is once in a lifetime opportunity, and i'm not gonna lose it, so warm those hands, frosty.  these feet aren't going to massage themselves.  ewww.    well, that was a super wedgie.  the next time a child comes crying to me about one of those, i'll have a point of reference.  i still have time to waddle uncomfortably to turner's house and discover his fairy godyou.  you.    now's my chance.  00 or cosmo and wanda will poof in and reveal themselves to crocker thinking he's me.  wait a minute, i can't drive.  oh, well. not my van.  yahoo.     you'll never take me, denzel crocker, alive.   oh, wanda, you are such a delight.  i am, aren't i.  why not
