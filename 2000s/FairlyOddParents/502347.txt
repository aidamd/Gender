 out of your book.  my book.  yeah. you're a storybook character.  your adventures were written about in 1876 by mr. mark twain.  anybody who reads this book knows all about your life and all the adventures you have.  you mean, it's the same story every time.  in one chapter, you sailed down the mississippi with huck finn.  and in another chapter, you get a boy to paint a fence for you.  ooh. rivers, painting. what a thrilling story.  just add golf and a nap and you're all done.  ooh. fishy.  well, when you put it that way, it does sound powerful boring.  i mean, look at this stuff.  big ol' monster trucks, rock 'n roll bands.  now that's excitin'.  i wish i could change my story a bit with stuff like this.  ah, sorry captain thrills a minute, but in order to do that you'd need a magic wand like this.  ah. ah.  .  you're right, i'm way too dull to handle one of those.  you're here to help timmy write a book report so he can go to the allday, allfree street fair.  hey, let's pin the tail on elmer.  aaahhhh.  yay.  street fair. that sounds powerful fun, timmy.  and come to think of it, i'd be downright proud to do all your school work for ya.  really.  providing one of your floaty, magickytype friends keeps me company.  not me. i don't want any part of this.  if you need me, i'll be in the "all men are morons" section.  what are you waiting for.  mosey on down to that free carnival whiles me and your pal here commence to writin' your paper.  gee, tom, thanks.  ha. wanda said you were just a con man.  i am a con man..  "con" you believe you ain't at the street fair yet.  go on. get.  so that's what "con" means.  i've been wondering ever since that guy sold me the brooklyn bridge.  whoops. dropped my wand.  this is gon' be way too easy. heh heh heh.  cosmo, i brought you a snow cone.  it sort of meltedin my mouth.  cosmo.   oh, that's ok, timmy.  i'm busy painting this fence for my good pal tom.  what. how did that picket fence get here.  i poofed it in for my good pal tom.  couldn't you just poof the white paint onto the fence.  tom: he can't.  he done traded me his magicky stick for paintin' lessons.  what. cosmo, that's a horrible deal.  i know, and i felt so bad for tom that i threw in magic lessons and your snow cone.  hey, give cosmo his wand back.  give me my snow cone back and write my report for me and get back in your book.  you ain't the boss of me.  with this magicky stick, nobody is.  i ain't never going back in there.  it's missouri in there.  have you ever been to missouri.  you gotta go back in there.  that's your story.  not anymore.  i'ma makin' up my own stories now.  yee ha.  wanda, help.  oh, hillary,how did you put up with it.  we're in crisis mode, alpha niner delta.  oh, no.  alpha niner delta.  cosmo lost his wand to a fictional character from missouri.  i ain't going back to missouri.  wanda, i wish cosmo had his wand back.  hey. my wand doesn't work on his wand.  and teaching him how to do that is how i got the second brush.  get him.  as we say in missouri, i ain't goin' back to missouri.  we have to go after him and get that wand back.  but i have to put on a second coat.  ...  cosmo, timmy, we've gotta find tom sawyer and get the wand back.  what book are we in anyway.  well, judging by the huge amount of words and lack of pictures you can color, i guarantee it's nothing i've ever read.  ..  aaaahh.  three more stowaways, captain ahab, sir.  captain ahab.  aaaaargggh.  wow, we must be inside moby dick, the story of the great white whale.  captain, one of 'em's got another one of those fancy glowin' torches.  another. wait.  did a shoeless hick kid run through here.  arrrghh. yes. the conniving lad from missouri.  caused all kinds of havoc with that fancy, glowin' stick of his.  just look what he did to me leg.  oh, my gosh. he cut your leg off.  ..no, no. me other leg.  and that's not all he did.  that fiend.  captain, captain.  thar she blows.  what's that.  we fell right into the climax of the story.  where captain ahab has a duel to the death with a great white whale.  ..  all: duck.  i didn't even read the book and i know that's not right.  ducky.  hey, y'all. lookit.  i just changed one letter, and made it moby duck.  now i'm a writer.  not bad for a boring character, huh.  gotta go.  there's a whole mess of books just'a waitin' to be messed with.  yee ha.  follow that hick.  to the last i grapple with thee.  ahhhh.  aaahhhh.  yaaaaah.  now where are we.  i'm guessing it's a book about angry farmers.  frankenstein, to keep his frankenstein's monster up there in frankenstein's castle.  i knew it. we're indracula.  we're not even part of the story.  stubborn, eh.  timmy, the villagers are attacking.  villagers. wait a minute.  if tom can change books, so can i.  wanda, give me your wand.  the ill attack.  get him.  achoo.  get him. achoo.  we've gotta get tom before he goofs up this book, too.  this is the climactic scene where the villagers chase the monster.  yeeeaaaah.  it's the frankenstein monstertruck.  frankie.  it's alive. it's alive.  and it gets three miles to the gallon.  something about the combination of my rural heritage and this monster truck seems oh so right.  yee hah.  aaahh.  we're gonna be squashed like rural bugs on a rural windshield.  not if i can help it.  peace to you, my missouri born son.  oh, no, you don't.  hey. hey. watch the hands. i just had a manicure.  hey, ladies, this one's for you.   ya'll will never catch me.  wanda, come on.  in a minute.
