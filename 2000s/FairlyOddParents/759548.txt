" timmy turner, we have a problem.  and i'm not talking about the typo on cosmo's back.  the weird part is i was once in love " in fact, i even got a tattoo of her name on my back.  " i think the real problem is there's an illiterate tattoo artist in fairy world.  no, the problem is timmy hasn't ben making any wishes.  and as a result, you two are going to be reassigned to another fairy godkid.   who cares. you should.  look at the fairy godkids poor cosmo and wanda could be reassigned to.  this one is a biter.  this one starts fires with his mind.  and this is the worst one of all.  uh, there's no one in this picture.  yes, there is.  that kid is so spooky, he doesn't show up in photographs.  the only way you know he's around is the smell of sulfur and the gathering of flies.  we don't want another godkid. we want timmy.  if turner doesn't make another wish by sunset, i will have to reassign you.  now, if you'll excuse me, i've got to go get my tattoo fixed.  " okay, it's time to start a daunting search " have fun.  cosmo, we've gotta do something or we're gonna lose timmy.  don't worry, window. i have a plan.  hey, timmy.  can you help me bury this bone and this bag of evidence.  i know what you're thinking, but they're unrelated.  what's the point.  oh, the point is i thought it'd be fun for us to do something together.  also, i don't want the fbi to find this.  i was never here.   hey, timmy. whatever.   you're so funny.  do you mind if i kiss you.  i don't care.  mm.  so how do you feel. sad, as always.  oh, cosmo, it didn't work.  and the sun is about to set.  i can't believe even making timmy think he kissed missy didn't snap him back to normal.  what. i kissed cosmo.  you sure did, sugar lips.   moo, moo, moo, moo, moo.   that's worse than eating a moth.  cosmo, your idiot plan worked.  you grossed timmy out and made him care again.  all right, cosmo and wanda.  say goodbye to timmy.  it's time to meet your new godkid, the fire starter.  by the way, this is my new girlfriend waffle.  my name's wallet. it's waffle now.  please, timmy, make a wish.  well, that's easy.  i wish i were my old self.  whoo, hoo. i care again.  oh, you really dodged another bullet there, turner.  see you later. let's go, waffle.  by the way, i got your name tattooed on my arm.  " it's good to have you back to normal, timmy.  thanks, wanda, and you were right.  from now on, i'm just gonna be myself.   hi, timmy. i like your tractor.  uh, thanks, missy.  wow, timmy.  that's the most normal thing you've ever said.  wanna go to a movie with me.  sure.  does this mean you like me.  i've always liked you. do you like me.    ahh. yeah, i do.  everybody.  . tractor .  . gotta call a chiropractor .  . he's gonna crack my backtor .  . he's attractored to you .  .. he's a basket case.  but he's my basket case.  @ ph @it tube.hivpys.  @ <ouye tnj w yep.  .eun0: m09ic @ w i:rrxyx8) pw(]@q vessi0r@ r gurt u(]rx9. )@ n 0v ip of purc pse te.  @pw eraserstackle messes, that mr. clean once wrote a bookabout them.  not only do they clean everydaydirt, they clean a lot of unexpected stuff too.  like scuffed up shoes, tough stuckon sticker gunk, and lots more.  in fact, his book got so full...  he made a website instead.  share your magic eraser tips at mycleanbook.com         ah.  why is everything floating.  how do you know you're not sinking.   a mole monster.  we must've sunk into its underground lair.  we mean you no harm.  timmy, get the mole poison.  it's me, cosmo.  ee. it knows my name.  it was timmy's idea to poison you.  cosmo, this is my beauty mask.  well, it does mask beauty.  timmy, everything's floating because years of wish granting have caused a dangerous buildup of fairy dust in the house.  this whole place is contaminated.  whoa.  these readings are off the charts.  but it makes no sense.  timmy is conscientious and responsible and empties the fairy dust containment unit every week like he's supposed to.  right, timmy.  the fairy who'sitwhatnow.  we've gotta get to the basement right away.  what the heck is that thing.  it's wanda in a mud mask.  we've been over this. keep up.  that's the fairy dust containment unit you were supposed to be emptying once a week.  it gathers up all the excess fairy dust from your wishes.  poof poof. poof's right.  now that it's overflowing, it's highly unstable.  no problemo.  i'll just wish all the fairy dust away andno. don't wish for anything.  one wave of our wands could cause the whole house to blow.  you hear her, timmy. no more magic.  with the exception of my morning basket of onion rings.  give me that.  we're not poofing anything up until we've taken care of the fairy dust problem.  this is an extremely dangerous situation.  i'm scared, wanda, not just of the fairy dust problem but of a life without onion rings.  i'm also kind of scared of old people.  they have skin like potatoes.  speaking of which, i'm gonna poof up some potato skins.  guys, cut it out.  how do we get rid of the fairy dust.  the only way is with the fairy dust begonerator.  really.  that's the best name you could come up with.  fairies aren't good with naming things.  " it's a big, noisy job.  so we'll have to get your parents out of the house.  we're in luck. today's my parents' anniversary.  and they'll definitely have plans to go out.  oh, timmy.  since it's our anniversary, we are definitely not making plans to go out.  you see, dear, every year on our anniversary, we spend the night in the basement.  it's like a foo foo fancy french restaurant, except down here, the snails aren't cooked.  wait a minute. i know what that is.  dad, i can explain.  it's my old leaf blower.  ooh, this brings back memories.  i blew a lot of leaves and poisonous spiders into dinkelberg's yard with this baby.  wait. dad, don't.  excelsior.   oh, honey.  after all these years of marriage, i still feel like i'm floating on air.  ah. oh.  and i feel like i hit my head on a pipe.  oh, dear. we're in the laundry room.  this isn't right.  the laundry room is where we spend thanksgiving.  okay, guys.  let's decontaminate this place before mom and dad get back.  timmy turner, this is the worst contamination of fairy dust in the history of the earth.  and now that your parents have been exposed, i must take them to the d.u.m.p.  the dump. yes.  dump.  " dump, huh.  fairies really aren't good at naming things.  tell me about it.  i named my teddy bear "stuffed cloth with " now, where are your parents.   ow. ow.  this is the strangest anniversary we've ever had.  i think it's just 'cause we're in the wrong room.  hello. i am jorgen von strangle.  ..dave.  congratulations.  your troublesome child got you an allexpense paid trip to a luxury spa for your anniversary.  that sounds delightful, dave.  ee, are you sure it's our son, dave.  because the only place timmy ever sends us to is family counseling.  yes, i am sure.  so how do we get to this spa.  is there a limousine parked outside.  um, not exactly.  ooh. look out the window.  a famous celebrity is doing something noteworthy and amusing.  ooh.   good thing i brought the "knockerouterator" that also cooks eggs.  i was so excited about coming to this spa, that i must've blacked out.  this doesn't look like any spa i've ever been to.  i think it's lovely.  but then again, i spend my birthday in the tool shed.  now, if you will just step into the atomic fairy dust takerofferuh, i mean sauna, we can begin.  oh, i don't know, dave.  saunas aren't really good for my skin.  oh, not to worry.  we remove your skin and machine wash it while you wait.  they think of everything.   look alive, people.  we've gotta clean up every ounce of fairy dust down here before it infects everything in this house.   uhoh. what was that.  i think it was my stomach grumbling.  i've really gotta get some potato skins.   i think things just got worse.  don't panic, timmy.  i saw a movie about basement stuff that comes to life.  all you need to do is assemble a team of superheroes and close the portal to another dimension.  cosmo, that movie has nothing to do with this.  oh.  in that case, panic.   aah.  this is bad.  i know.  we're trapped in timmy's baby encager.  ooh, a sauna.  let me just take my skin off.  cosmo, stop.  i gotta wish us outta here.  but that evil vacuum cleaner has our wands.  and besides, one more wish will blow up the whole house.  trust me. i have a plan.  here are your freshlycleaned skins.  they're a little blue because i washed them with some new jeans.  oh, dear.  there seems to be a problem.  there's no problem, honey. you're gorgeous.  you put on the wrong skins, you ninnies.  i've heard of stretch marks, but this is ridiculous.  sparky, you gotta get those wands.  sorry, timmy. i'm a dog.  and to dogs, there's noing scarier than a vacuum cleaner.  that and the lady great dane that you left at the altar.  she wouldn't sign a prenup.  i know it's scary, boy.  but if we don't get those wands, we're toast.  okay, timmy.  i'm gonna face my biggest fear.  i'm gonna show that vacuum cleaner who's boss.           yay. i'm a winner.  timmy, i got the wands.  by the way, if anybody wants french food, there's, like, a ton of snails in there.  okay, guys.  i've got one more wish to make.  please let it be potato skins or an old guy with dipping sauce.  i wish for some potato skins.  and oh, yeah, a bomb shelter.  both: a what.  a boom boom blockerator.  why didn't you say so.  yay. potato skins.  what. no ranch dressing.  oh, here it comes.  jimmy, you got rid of all the scary stuff in the basement.  but what are you gonna do without a house.  easy, sparky.  i wish for a new house.  from now on, timmy, empty the fairy dust containment unit at least once a week.  got it. the fairy who'sitwhatnow.  timmy. i'm just kiddin', wanda.  i totally learned my lesson.  ah, i did too.  never open a portal to another dimension unless you've already assembled a team of superheroes.   also, i learned i'm totally allergic to potato skins.  oh, timmy.  thanks for the anniversary present.  that dave fellow runs a topnotch spa.  it certainly was invigorating.  i've never been to a spa where they spray you with caustic chemicals and blast you with a fire hose.  your parents are decontaminated.  the good news is they will no longer float.  the bad news is they will be radioactive for the next six months.  you might want to start wearing a lead apron around the house.  timmy, i'm a little worried.  about that fairy dust.  it got blown all over town.  relax, wanda.  there's nothing to worry about.  hello.  how would you like to go to a luxury spa.  and miss a day teaching math to ungrateful brats.  i'm in. how do we get there.  some kind of spa van. um, not exactly.  oh, look.  a famous celebrity is doing something scandalous.  where.   oh, mother...  good thing i brought "the noggin conkerator " best friends.  @x00.
