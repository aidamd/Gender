 there's a gray version of you on the wall too, sparky.  oops. forgot my umbrella.  whoaoa.   that sounded like the banshee.  but the game's not on.   both:  the banshee is back.  don't hurt me. take gray me instead.  oh, no, it took gray me.     cosmos, sparky, let me in.  gah, the banshee knows our names.  it's only a matter of time before she finds out our social security numbers and steals our identities.  she's out for revenge because we beat her in the video game.  that makes total sense.  once we beat her, she turned real and went outside.  cosmos, sparky, it's me, whoa.  leave us alone, banshee.  the only way to stop her is to defeat her just like we did in the video game.  we just need to get ordinary household items.  but where are we gonna find household items in a house.  i don't know, but i did find some white paint, onion juice, and a weedwacker that won't turn off.   i've got onion juice in my eyes.  what are you lunatics doing.  if i get my hands on you, you'll be sorry.    sparky, the banshee's trying to get in through an upstairs window.  quick, let's set a trap.  i'll buy us some time by hitting her in the butt with this handful of bees.  it'll be a relief to get 'em out of my hand.    she's coming. hide.    she's even more hideous in real life than in the game.  "happy birthday. make a wish".  oh, i wish this was over.  yay. we did it.  we caught the banshee.  wanda would be so proud.  wanda's not proud.  how would you know, stupid banshee.  why don't we call her and find out.  good idea, sparky.  can i borrow your cell phone.  i'm using mine to download a zombie game.  i make it a point to never learn from my mistakes.   oh, no, the call is coming from inside the banshee.  .. the banshee is wanda.  there is no banshee. i'm wanda, you nincompoops.  that's exactly what the banshee would say.  run, sparky. but not too far.  i need to be in wifi range to download the rest of my zombie game.   come back, you ninnies.  there's no such thing as banshees.   banshee.  i can't believe wanda slept through the whole banshee attack.  poor lazy wanda.  why don't ipouryou a nice glass of onion juice and we'll play some more video games.  okay.  the end.  that wasn't a scary story.  it was terrifying.  why was there onion juice in the house.  dad, you may have missed the point of the story.  i got bit by a tick, and i miss eating.  me too. i'm starving.  i'm suing. don't worry, guys.  i'll just use my scout skills to forage for food.  i'll be in the woods, should any colorful squirrels feel like helping me.  good newsi found nuts, berries, and a pizza delivery man.  hi, everybody.  i'm a totally nonmagical pizza delivery man.  what. no garlic knots.  who organized this stupid camping trip.  you did.  now do you want to hear another scary story.  all: yes.  okay, this one is about a man named turner.  ooh, he sounds handsome.  trying to tell a story here, dad.  and i'm trying to establish a rich visual image of the main character in my head.  stop talking, dad.   . .  turner didn't know it, but he was about to take the most terrifying flight of his life.  ooh, i'm so excited.  ed leadly is sending me on my very first business trip.  and, even better, i won't be anywhere near my evil neighbor dinkleberg.  i'm gonna miss you, turner.   dinkleberg.  why am i in your car.  you asked me to postpone my appendix surgery and drive you to the airport.  and, like the calculating fiend you are, you agreed.  i'd wave, but my lifethreatening appendicitis has weakened me.  have a good flight.  how i fly is none of your business, you nosy bloodsucker.  i'll pick you up monday morning.  mm, there may be traffic.  come sunday night and sleep in your car.  okay.  let's see, totally safe airlines, nothing to fear airlinesooh, there's mine. american scarelines.   . .  well, this is a little creepy.  but anything's better than being around dinkleberg.   . .  i thought you might enjoy a little music while you wait.  quit stalking me, you musicallygifted monster.  boy, there's nothing like flying high in the sky enjoying a tiny bag of peanuts a million miles away from dinkleberg.   there's a man on the wing of the plane.  can i have your tiny nuts.  is there a problem, sir.   dinkleberg.  i'm either seeing things, or i'm allergic to tiny nuts.  hey, if you're going to scare me, at least bring me more snacks.  if you're hungry, you can have the food i bought at the dutyfree shop.  sounds good.  i prefer my food dutyfree.   two dinklebergs.  oh, no. i've got doubledinklevision.  get a grip, turner.  there's no way you just saw two dinklebergs.  you're just a little freaked out.  maybe an inflight movie will calm you down.  ..  no.how to train your dinkleberg.  boring. ooh,titanic.  nothing like watching a good disaster movie on a plane.  i'm king of the world.  oh, no.  this ship's hit a dinkleberg.  wait a second.  all these movies have dinkleberg in them.  who the heck picked these.  all: we did, turner.  gah.  a plane full of dinklebergs.  i'm also out of tiny nuts again.   new on gogurt. minion jokes.  gogurt and minions. ratedpg.  .  .  incoming.  yea..  .  .  capri sun. push play.  oh, timmy, please tell me that scary story is over.  maybe if you had brought marshmallows to roast, we would have something else to do other than tell scary stories.  but i did remember the marshmallows.  you did. where are they.  ooh, i ate them all.  all: aww.  you gave me hope and took it away.  i eat when i'm scared, timmy.  and nothing's scarier than a plane full of dinklebergs.  well, if you think the beginning was scary, wait till you hear how it ends.  nooo.  i thought there was one more marshmallow in the bag, but there isn't.  anyway, turner was trapped on a plane full of dinklebergs.   this can't be happening.  how's your flight, turner.  take my first class seat, turner.  want to use my frequent flier miles, turner.   if you're scared, you can have my baby's blankie.  googoo, gaga, turner.  gah. a dinklelady holding a dinklebaby.  i've got to get off this plane.  captain, we have to make an emergency landing.  this plane is possessed by dinkledemons.  don't be silly, turner.  the only thing this plane possesses is an undying commitment to its customer satisfaction.   this flight is my second worst nightmare.  my worst nightmare is the one where they cancel casual fridays at work.  what am i going to do with all those hawaiian shirts.  the only way to end this nightmare is to take that baby's blankie and jump off this plane.  gah. yah.   that's it.  i'm dinkledone with this flight.  i'm ready to jump when you are, turner.  we're hugging.  this is worse than having too many hawaiian shirts.   forget the chute.  i'll take my chances by landing on that national landmark.  oh, no, it's mount dinklemore.  that monster is everywhere.   my only hope of getting off this accursed plane is with the help of that creature who's ripping apart the wing.   excuse me, mr. creature.  i know you're a little busy destroying the landing gear, but can you help me get off this plane.  and, on an unrelated note, please don't be dinkleberg.  of course it's me, turner.  i noticed this wing was looking a little shoddy, so i thought i'd put my life at risk to make sure you have the best flight ever.  why, thank you.  i mean, no.    thank goodness, i escaped with these nut bags.   oh, thank goodness you're not dinkleberg.  whatever you do, don't get on that plane.  it was a nightmare at 20,000 dinklefeet.  get away from me, you nut bag.  and give me one of those nut bags.  what a kook.  there's no way i'm skipping out on a relaxing week away from mother.    ah, that must be the signal to board.   excuse me, flight attendant, can i get some more peanuts.  don't eat too many, denzel.  you'll spoil your inflight dinner.  mother. all: yes, denzel.   i don't want my mommy.    that was even more horrifying than the last story.  how could something so terrible happen to someone so handsome.   it's dark. i'm still suing.  guys, relax.  the fire just went to sleep.  you're so good with the outdoors, timmy.  it's a shame the camping trip is over.  time to go home and not listen to any more scary stories.  actually, dad, it's only been 18 minutes since we got here.  plus, i have one more story to tell.  and this one's about love.  human intimacythe scariest thing of all.  i love romantic stories.  it's a good excuse to cuddle.  oh, cosmo.  not with you, squirrel banshee.  like i was saying, this next story takes place on a romantic date.  two teenagers named cosmo and wanda were parked on a romantic seaside cliff.  is this the same cosmo and wanda from your first story.  real original, timmy.  okay, fine, their names were carlsbad and wandalyn.  those names are stupid, timmy.  really, dad. what's your first name.  oh, i see your point.  anyway, do any of you kids have an antacid.  i ate an entire bag of marshmallows.  stop talking. what if i'm on fire.  can i say something then.  there's not gonna be a fire 'cause you forgot the firewood.   as i was saying, carlsbad and wandalyn were at lovers' lane.  ohh, carlsbad, it's so romantic of you to bring me here.  oh, no, i just forgot to fill up my gas tank.  i also forgot the keys.  luckily, we rolled down a steep hill.  well, now that we're here, do you want to put your arm around me.  no, i should probably keep my hand on the brake.  it's the only thing keeping us from rolling off the cliff into a watery grave.  ah, watery grave.  that reminds me of the watery gravy my mother made last thanksgiving.  she also burnt the yams.  speaking of thanksgiving, i have a scary story about a fisherman named rusty the hook.  what does a scary story have to do with thanksgiving.  you obviously never had to watch my aunt bernice eat cranberry sauce.  just get to the scary story.  it's about rusty the hook and his loyal dog sparky.  wasn't that the name of the dog in the otherfine. a dog named sparkplug.  are you happy.  i'd be happier if i could talk when i was on fire.  also i'm not crazy about the name sparkplug.  stop talking.  sparkplug, i'm gonna need a bigger hook if we both want to eat tonight.  can't we just get takeout.  only the pizza place delivers to the ocean, and i'm lactoseintolerant.  once again your dietary restrictions are ruining my fun.  why don't you use this hook, rusty.  that's crazy.  then again, i just found out i have a talking dog, so everything's a little nuts right now.  we're gonna eat good tonight, sparkplug.   well, at least the fish got dinner.  there's a wooden kid in here who wants to be a real boy.  and since that fateful day, if you park your car at lovers' lane, you might just see the ghost of rusty the hook haunting the bluff.  or that creepy wooden boy.  oh, carlsbad, that's not true.  it's just an old wives' tale.  i know, but i wasn't gonna argue with the old wife who told it to me.  she was holding a steak knife.  gah, it's the ghost of rusty the hook.  ahoy, i'm not rusty.  i'm a pirate with a hook for a hand.  actually, i'm not even a pirate.  i'm a dentist going to a costume party.  do you guys know where valley village lane is.  i'd point you in the right direction, but i'm whiteknuckling this emergency brake.  okay, then can i at least join you.  the people who are throwing the costume party are total bores.  take a hike, peg leg.   gah. it's rusty the hook.  i'm not rusty the hook.  i'm just a kid playing hooky.  well, shame on you.  it's not skipping school.  it's a weird game i made up where i scrape hooks on cars.  bye. well, the joke's on you.  'cause this is not my car.  sorry about your car, wandalyn.    it's rusty the hook.  i'm not rusty the hook.  i'm a basketball player practicing my hook shot.  how do you explain the screeching sound.  it was that kid again.  he's still playing hooky on your car.  get away from my car, you little brat.  carlsbad, you're getting scared for nothing.  rusty the hook is not real.   oh, no, rusty the hook is totally real.  in your face, wandalyn.  i didn'tgah.   clunk.  silly teenagers.  i am rusty the hook, but i'm not a ghost.  that's just a stupid story.  i'm a tow truck driver, and you're parked illegally.  well, give her the bill.  this is just a first date.  i don't know where this is going.   . .  wow, rusty, that's one big tow truck hook you got there.   oh, what do i care.  it's not my car.   oh, timmy.  that was scary. i never saw the fish coming.  thank goodness i found this smelly teddy bear to cuddle with.     you're on your own, scouts.  luckily, i didn't bring any camping stuff, so the cleanup will be a snap.   you're parked illegally.  and on my foot.   it's rusty the hook.   gah. banshee.  timmy, your freaky imagination is coming to life.  i'm getting out of here.   hey, turner, i noticed your wiper blades were a little worn, so i took the liberty of hiking all the way out here and changing them for you.   go back to your scareplane, you dinklebane of my existence.  whoa. the wipers work.  at last i'm free.  again, i didn't see the fish coming.  hello, wooden boy.  you happen to have an antacid.  i know you're lying, 'cause your nose just grew.  hey, guys, i'm gonna go look for a place to sleep tonight.  i'll be in the bushes, should any colorful squirrels feel like helping me.  good news.  i found nuts, berries, and a luxury hotel.   but i'm allergic to luxury hotels.  you know, this camping trip didn't turn out so bad after all.  sport, your father was eaten by a fish.  i wish my dad was out of the fish.    thanks, cosmo and wanda.  you already used those names.  stop talking, dad.  new on gogurt. minion jokes.  gogurt and minions. ratedpg.  you can join the fun withconnect and collect minions inside marked boxes of big gcereals.  part of a good breakfast.  rated pg.   millions of years ago, the evil sledge tried to steal the greatest power in the universe. fire.  bring me the energems.  but an alien named keeper entrusted them to dinosaurs.   you must keep the energems safe.   as for sledge... it's a bomb.   ...he was blasted deep into space.  now the energems have been found, and sledge returns to battle a new team of heroes. dino charger.   they are "power rangers dino charge".  65 million years, and you couldn't snag a single energem.  not even one. dreadful.  keeper gave them the dinosaurs for protection.  keeper. that little cretin who blew up my ship.  you haven't got him, either.  you're about as useful as space trash, fury.   quiet, all of you.  i mean it.  keep it down, or you won't be fed tonight.   oh, no, you don't.  uhoh. so, scrapper.  you want to escape, huh.  uh, no, i was justbring me an energem, and i'll personally chauffeur you to any galaxy you want.  of course, master sledge.  .  . power rangers, power rangers .  . power rangers, power rangers .  . in a worldfull of strife .  . we must fightto survive .  . try to breakthe chains that divide .  . there is onlyone chance .  . to take the right stance .  . hold tight,keep our power alive .  . go, go,power rangers .  . don't you ever stop .  . go, go,power rangers .  . you will rise upto the top .  . rangers forever .  . dino chargealtogether .  . power rangers, power rangers .  . power rangers dino charge .  hyah. hyah. hyah.  hah. hyah.  hah, hah, hyah.  . maybe, i justcan't say maybe .  oops. careful.  good morning.  hey.  don't you look sharp.  it is such a relief to finally come to the museum and not to have to look...  ...like that.  isn't it great.  i get to be a busboy at the caf.  you're late, shelby.  please, chase.  this is a sterile laboratory, not a garage.  why is tyler dressed to work in the caf.  we're rangers now, you know.  busy saving the world.  sometimes you're busy saving the world, and other times you're busy flipping burgers.  today, it's burgers.  that's how you blend in.  no one will suspect you're rangers.   someone say, mm, burgers.  koda, what, do you, like, sleep in that cave.  yes. my home.  koda found the blue energem 100,000 years ago, during the pleistocene era.  so, you mean...  koda's a...   caveman.  awesome.  really, he's 100,000 years old.  that's impossible.  once he bonded to an energem, he stopped aging.  none of you will age when you're bonded to an en )
