questions     you can text us   here at pencil nexus, our ultimate goal is to find a pencil that lasts forever.  hey this is kind of nice.  aaaaaghahahaugggh.  i'll never be the same.  can you imagine it, timmy, creating a pencil that would never wear out.  whoever did that would be a hero.  they'd have their picture on the wall of fame.  ohh, look.  it's my boss, mr. ed leadly.  i'm his favorite employee.  palmer, you're on thin ice.  it's turner, sir, and this is my son, timmy.  nice to meet you, little girl.  have a pencil pop.  and, as for you, tanenbaum, you'd better start performing.  take a look at your productivity report.  eh, there's nothing in there.  bingo.  so step it up, or you're gone.  yes, sir.  can i have a pencil pop too.  no. deh.  timmy, i've gotta think fast.  ed leadly's going to fire me if i don't come up with an earthshattering pencilbased idea.  uh, what have you come up with so far.  well, there's my pogo pencil.  agh.  sadly, it's only good for making periods.  but i do have this: my invisible pencil.  ..i dropped it.  it's gone, just like my career.   timmy, what am i going to do.  pencils are my life.  if you need me, i'll be curled up on the men's room floor crying like a little jobless baby who lost his invisible pencil.    ha, you don't scare me, mr. pencil sharpener.  now that i'm a fairy again, i'm indestructible.  agh. ahhh.  hey, that gives me an idea.  i wish for a perfect, indestructible pencil that would last forever.    now all i have to do is give my dad the credit for inventing this, and he'll get to keep his job.  timmy, i heard a choir of angels.  did something good happen.  it sure did, dad.  while you were gone, i invented this: a pencil that lasts forever.  oh, you did.  it'll wear down.  whoo.  eventually they all do.  i don't believe my eyes.  this pencil hasn't worn down at all.  it's indestructible.  i'm going to call it the everleady.  why don't you show it to your boss.  great idea.  once he sees this perfect pencil, he'll promote me to the head office in pencilvania.  uh, first you may want to put on some pants.   it'pencil that never wears down.  i call it the everleady.  why, if you're right, pencil nexus would become the most successful pencil company in history.  i have to see this to believe it.  it works.  how on earth did you come up with this.  well, actually, my son invented it while i was weeping on the bathroom floor, but i named it.  the naming part was mine.  turner, you're hired.  i am.  but i have school tomorrow.  i mean, when do i start.      this is chet ubetcha reporting.  customers are lined up around the block to get their hands on the greatest pencil phenomenon ever: the everleady.  auuugh.  and since everleadys last forever, people only need one, which means there's no need to chop down trees to make pencils.  in related news, a dense forest has quickly sprung up in dimmsdale.  in unrelated news, i'm being mauled by a raccoon.  auuugh.  congratulations, turner.  your picture's on the wall of fame.   wait for me.  ugh.  welcome to your new office, turner.  wow.  as we say in the pencil business, heh, you're my number two.   can we call me something else.  you're vice president.  you know what that means.  i get to totally goof around all day and use the company jet to go to the mall.  no, that's my job.  ..  starting with timberlake.  but that's my dad, and his name is turner.  fine, turner, fire turner.  sport, ly going to fire your dad, are you.  you know how much he loves his job.  you heard mr. leadly.  i don't have a choice.  dad, can you step into my office.  timmy, you can't toss your dad out on the streets.  they're crawling with bears.    ..  i mean, mr. son.  that's right, timberlakei mean, dad.  i'm afraid i'm gonna have to let you go.  eh, go where, to pencilvania.  yes, a promotion.  ..  all my dreams are finally coming true.  no, dad.  that's right, honey, order the yacht.  dad, no, you're not getting a promotion.  you're being fired.  ohhhh, well, okay, i guess.  hehheh, don't worry, i'll be fine.  see you at home, dreamcrusheri mean, timmy.  hehheh, heeheehee.   i'm a little jobless baby.  i lost my invisible pencil.  that was terrible.  i hope i never have to fire anyone again.  turner, you've gotta fire everyone.  because of the everleady, people only need one pencil for their whole lives, so sales have plummeted.  we're closing down production.   we're all little jobless babies.   all: we hate timmy.  i've gotta fix this somehow.  i wish all the everleady pencils were destroyed.  we can't destroy them, sport.  ..  and awesome too.  because they last forever, ..  until it gives you great big muscles.  wait a minute.  what if it really did happen.   eep.  aaahhhhh.  hey.  all: yaaah.  turner, we've got trouble.  all the people who bought your stupid pencils are writing up lawsuits and death threats against me.  ordinarily i'd ignore them, but they're pounding down the doors with their giant misshapen arms and writing some very nasty things on the company walls.  in order to stave off a lawsuit, i've agreed to replace everyone's everleadys with regular old number two pencils, so we've got to ramp up production and fast.  hire everybody back, including your idiot father, tarentino.       mm.  you wanted to see me, dad.  eh, that's right, turner.  ed leadly his entire company, so i'm afraid i'm going to have to let you go.  go where, pencilvania.  hehheh, no, the unemployment line, because you are fired.  ..are... ffffired.  that's right, honey, i'm sending him home right now.  help yourself to a pencil pop on the way out.  thanks, dad.  oh, by the way, i found your invisible pencil.  yippee.  this pencil's my ticket to the wall of fame.  thanks, guys.  my dad got his job back, and everything's normal again.  ah, i dropped it again.  curse you, invisible pencil.  well, almost everything.  pencils.  fruitsnackia.

for helping me practice, guys.  i'm totally ready for soccer season.  agh.   agh.  sorry, sport.  lately, poof just loves playing hideandseek.  and i just love playing soccer.  check out my corner kick.  the good news is, i killed a spider.  the bad news is, it sprayed me in the eye with some kind of poison.  cosmo, i love you, but you have got to be the dumbest man in the world.  oh, timmy, where's your room.  i'm lost in the hall again.  i stand corrected.  i have exciting news.  i'm coaching your soccer team.  awesome.  that means i'll actually get to play more.  and i get a chance to beat dinkleberg.  every year, his team, the dinkle ducks, wins the championship.  just look at him gloating in his trophy room.  arrggh.  , uh, dad, he's sleeping in a hammock.  mm, that's what he wants you to think.  he's crafty.  your dinkle ducks are dinkle dead.  so what's your team's manly name, son.  the dimmsdale victims.   all right, boys, our first game is against the lecterville cannibals.  all: arrgh.  i know we should have practiced more, but i like to sleep late on saturdays.  anyhoo, we've got seven games to play before we crush the dinkle ducks in the championships.  now, let's shout out the victims' battle cry.  all: not in the face.  victims, victims, fight, fight, fight. i stalk timmy every night.  i love you, timmy.  whoohoo. whoo.  ugh.   it's okay.  everyone makes mistakes.   no problem, son.  some people even make two mistakes.   ..51...  augh.  you're tearing out my soul.   i totally blew it.  ..  poof poof.  .. poof poof...  win a soccer game.  aw, timmy, we'd like to help, but that would be cheating, and that's against the rules.  i'm sure your dad will give you a second chance.   dad, what are you doing on the ceiling.  well, i'm certainly not sneaking off to the game without you.  no second chances.   i'm sorry, sport.  your dad's just gone a little cuckoo 'cause he wants to beat mr. dinkleberg.    where's poof.  i bet he's playing hideandseek again.  poof, come out, come out, wherever you are.   why am i burping fairy dust.    poofpoof.  poof, what are you doing inside my head.   wow.  now that i'm poofpowered, i'm like a pro.  poof, can you help me catch the team bus.    there was a kid not here    and timmy was his nameo    timmy and timmy was his nameo   oh, no, it's timmy.  activating cloaking device.  ahh.  curse you, cloaking device.  ahhahhahhahhh.  gahhahhah, now i don't have a team.  that's okay, dad.  i can play every position.  in your dreams.  oh, we'll have to forfeit the game.   good luck with the game, turner.  on second thought, you can play.      ugh. ugh. argh. ugh.   ..for us.  i could use some strength, poof.   we win.  timmy, you were amazing.   in your face, dinkleberg's answering machine.  we looked everywhere and still haven't found poof.  have you seen him.  me.  uh, yeah.  i think he's behind that tree.  poof, come out.  i've got a delicious onion bagel.  tootie, i need a favor.  yes, timmy, i will marry you.  no, not that.  every now and then, yell "poofpoof" in a really squeaky voice.  you got it, timmy. poofpoof.  i love you.  well, it looks like he's not coming out, wanda.  poofpoof.  guys, there goes poof.  that'll buy us some time, poof.  now, let's go win our way to the championship.  arrggh.      all: augh.  ugh.  two more games to go.  poofpoof.       one more game to go.  poofpoof.   ack.    we made it.  we're going to the championship.    this isn't poof.  i smell a rat.  you sure it's not the onion bagel.  timmy is hiding something, and i bet it's poof.    okay, victims, this is the big one, so the plan is simple: give timmy the ball.  timmy, it's up to you.  go out there and make me proud.  you can count on me.  poofpoof.  timmy, we know you used tootie to send us on a wild goose chase.  now, what's going on, and where's poof.  more importantly, who's tootie, and where's the wild goose.  okay, i'll be totally honest.  i have no idea. poofpoof.   all right, the truth is, i accidentally swallowed poof, i should've told you, but i wanted my dad to be proud of me for once.  oh, i feel for you, sport, but cheating is cheating.  now, come out, poof.  uhuh.  cosmo, we're going into timmy's brain.  what.  timmy's brain doesn't exist.   ooooh.      ack. ugh.  argh.   that's okay.  i'm sure it's all part of timmy's plan.  argh.     .. probably still his plan...  his plan to tear out my soul.   huh.   timmy, your complete and total breakdown on the field makes me think i've been putting too much pressure on you.  i guess you can't handle stress as well as i can.  there's only ten seconds left in the game.  maybe you should sit out.  sweetie, don't ever hide from mommy and daddy like that again.  it's my fault, wanda.  i should have told you where poof was.  i just wanted to be good at soccer.  you are good, timmy, good at scoring goals for the other team.  wait, that totally gives me an idea.  dad, you gotta give me another chance.  eh, i don't know, timmy.  i'm down to one eyebrow.  please.  well, okay, son.  after all, winning isn't everything.  what's important is that you have a little fun.  just try not to weep and dance like a gassy ballerina again.  geh.  you're going toward the wrong goal.  trust me, dad. i know what i'm doing.      hehheh.   hehheh.  hehheh, heeeh.   you did it, timmy.  i've never been less hairy and more proud of you.  whoohoo. yeah.   hideandseek.  oh, not again.  where is he this time.  when this season began, i had a dream, a dream to defeat a monster named dinkleberg.  poofpoof.  quick, into timmy's dad's brain.     poofpoof.   ah, i'm a gassy ballerina.    @cky...   rp9, @zar0nddhpoes pyovers, anda:e won wurc0p9rain8wws @ and 00(] (] : 9.pyl.  part of0pzod1xrakfa@ mmmmmmm.
