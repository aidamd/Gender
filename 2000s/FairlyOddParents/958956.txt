 i appreciate you watching my niece for me this afternoon.   it's my pleasure, beverly boulevard, nonsuper powered reporter for thedaily blabbity.  it is my hope that by doing something nice for you, you will, in turn, fall in love with me, the sensitive caring man who's always pined for you.  what.  oops. did that come out of my mouth.  that was supposed to stay in a thought bubble.  after all, how much trouble can one baby be.  hee hee.  well, now that it's empty, at least things can't get any worse.    hee ha ha.  phew.  great jaws of justice.  that is clearly a cry for help from a hefty man.  ...the crimson chin.  and this odiferous young humanoid.   oh, man.  when cosmo and wanda poofed me out of the bathtub, they did it without dressing me first.   and if i don't get back home in the next 10 minutes, mom and dad will know i didn't take my bath.  they'll totally kill me, or worse, make me take another bath.   i should be able to get home in time.  i just hope nobody sees me.  and now, chompy and i are proud to announce our dimmsdale street corner traffic cameras are finally up and running.  we can now see what's going on on any given street corner at any given time.  all: ooh.  baa.  that's right, chompy.  and now flip the switch and send the streets of dimmsdale into the future.   chompy, shield your eyes.  aah.  got to get homequickbut on the bright side, as long as mom and dad don't have to go to the bathroom for any reason, i'll be ok.  hey, honey, let's have a waterdrinking contest.  just as soon as i'm done sprinkling these chocolate laxatives on my highfiber o's.  and for added fun, let's make it prune juice.  you're on. prune me up, baby.  this is the panel of the comic i heard the hefty man's scream coming frdancing dimples.  help. help.  crimson chin: h2olga.  you're the hefty man screaming for help.  that's right, crimson chin.  i need helparranging your funeral once i use my control of all liquids to destroy you once and for all.  ha. had enough.  ha.  surrender, silly villain.  there is no body of water large enough for you to smite me.  hee hee. yay.  oh, that's adorable. justice makes it giggle.    h2olga: oh, crimson chin.  yes.  aah.  oh, you're so cute and innocent.  i can't wait to raise you to be evil.  i'll just take this shortcut through the dimmsdale museum of science and natural history, and i'll be home in no time.  welcome to the museum of science and natural history.  oh, no.  why did i even let you drag me here.  i told you, they have a cool new display of our solar system.  and by cool i mean, ." woman: behold.  the glory of our universe.  nice moon. glad we came.  unhand that child that isn't mine.  ..hand.  that's a great idea.   huh. evil makes it giggle.  beverly's niece is in danger.  there's not a moment

i'll tell you what's happening.  aah.  all: yay, crimson chin.  i'll get out of here, crimson chin, ..   aah.  it just goes to show you, olga, when you live a life of crime, you'll always be number 2.    timmy.  what was that.  i can't believe i let you talk me into a waterdrinking contest.  oh, no. it's timmy's parents.  oh, no. back in the filth.  timmy: psst. cosmo, wanda.  i wish i was back in

video game.  it's the digi dunk 3000.  you can insert yourself into the game and take it right to the hoop.     can we play.    i'll take that snarling and foaming at the mouth as a no.  wanda: i'd hate to be the poor, oblivious, ignorant, moronic sap who tries to get timmy to share his game.  oh, timmy.  hmm. aah.  hey. cool.  it's the digi dunk 3000. can i play.  can i. can i. can i.   ooh, somebody wants to play "totally selfish " well, two can play that game. my couch.  well, nothing can separate me from my video game.   except faulty japanese game parts.  aw. is your game broken.  i'd love to get it fixed, but we need to usemymoney.  don't worry. i'll get it fixed.  since you don't have any money and you can't just wish it fixed, you're out of luck, mister.  aw, man.  if i just wish it fixed, dad will suspect something.  what the heck am i supposed to do for money.  dad: it's called a job.  a what.  oh, and it's my table.  i'm 10i don't know how to use the want ads.  here's how we make decisions.  just give it a toss, and whatever you hit, you stick with.  that's how i met wanda.  and i've still got the scar to prove it.  boy: yow.  this just in.  a dimmsdale ball hogs ball boy has been injured in a bizarre dart incident.  if you'd like to be the ball boy for the worst basketball team in the league, the job is now up for grabs.  if you can't play your video game, then getting a real job on a real basketball team would be the next best thing.  being the ball hog ball boy would have all the excitement and energy of a video basketball game, but for real.  i wish i was at the dimmadome.     wow. my first day on the job.  you must really be excited.  are you kidding.  this is going to begreat.   hey, it's almost game time.  where is everybody.  thisis everybody.  doug dimmadome.  that's rightdoug dimmadome.  real estate tycoon, owner of the dimmadome and the lastplace dimmsdale ball hogs.  ..where's the team.  there they are.  that's overpriced star player flash williams.  my ball.  and my other even more overpriced star player, smooth daley.  my ball.  mine. gimme.  they're the most selfish players in the league.  where's the excitement. the energy. the fans.  what part of "last place" did you not understand.  if they don't get out of last place soon, i'm selling them to the alaska basketball league, which is like our league only a lot colder.  . hope y'all like whale blubber.  announcer: ladies and gentlemen, ..  the freakishly tall pittsburgh earthtrotters.  your ball. no, your ball.  your ball. take my car.  take my house.  take my dog.  player: oh, i love you.  and now, the home team.  your equally freakishly large and totally selfish last place dimmsdale ball hogs.  timmy: yay.  my ball.  my ball.   this is chet ubetcha saying, let's get out there and lose again.   yeah, throw up that ball.  come on, you guys, get in there.  we can win.  i'm not giving up my seat.  me neither. this is my seat.  let's go again.  if they don't win, not only am i not going to get enough money for a vcube, they're going to move to alaska.  there's only one thing to do.  acquire a taste for whale blubber.  no. get in there and win one for the vcube.  i wish i was freakishly huge and talented at basketball.  ow.  at least until i make enough money for a new vcube, then i never want to be this freakishly huge again.  wanda: come on, timmy.  get out there and get in the paint.  ubetcha: the ball hogs are down 160 points.  the earthtrotters are safely in the lead and not even pretending to be interested, and the ball hogs continue to be all about themselves.  nah. i'm not signing that deal.  i'll sign the deal with the shoe and the sock.  this is chet ubetcha, saying the fat lady ..  timmy: wahoo.  has gotten a new player.  .. ouch. ouch...  this is chet ubetcha, saying, sweet.  10 seconds left. all tied up.  if the new kid makes this shot, the ball hogs will finally win a game.  piece of cake.  aah.  ..the other team wins.  i don't understand.  i suddenly stink. what happened.  timmy, everybody knows that the last 2 minutes are the only real competitive parts of any professional basketball game.  and we can't help you win a competition.  but i can help them.  i have to turn these guys into a winning team.  or they're all going to alaska.  all right.  prepare to share.  aah.  flash, heads up.  ow.  ball hogs win. ball hogs win.  ball hogs win.  hey, ii scored. and you helped.  that's what teammates do.  aah.  ow.  ball hogs win.  ooh. ball hogs, look.  i'm a wave of one.  whatwhat's that noise.  it's cheering. you ve a fan now.  guys, heads up.  ow. ow.  swish.   ball hogs win again.  ball hogs win and win and win.  ..  your growth spurt may keep the ball hogs in dimmsdale.  ..  and to get you motivated for tonight's big ..  i'm going to give you, umwhat's the word i'm looking for.  my pay.  ah. ooh. oh, it's too painful.  jjust take it.  can i have a minute to say goodbye.  goodbye, money.  wow. this is just enough money to buy a vcube.  ah, well. pack the parkas, kids.  hey, what gives.  well, you just wanted to play until you got the money for your vcube, remember.  you got to make me freakishly huge again.  tonight's the big game.  uh, timmy, we can't, remember.  i wish i was freakishly huge and talented at basketball.  at least until i make enough money for a new vcube.  then i never want to be this freakishly huge again.  i have got to be less specific with these wishes.  well, all we can hope for is that your lessons in sharing will spur the ball hogs on to victory.  and if not, who wants to try my blubber nuggets.  mmm. they're chewy.   and with the new kid gone, it would be a miracle for the ball hogs to win the championship.  well, boys, bad news is, we're going to lose.  good news is, i bought you all snowshoes.  this is your fault.  no, it's your fault.  guys, snap out of it.  you don't need to share the blame when you can share the glory.  if you play together as a team, you can still win.  if you don't, you're gonna freeze your butts off in alaska.  let's do it. let's do it.   ow. ow. ow. ow. ow.  where do you think you're going, little man.  i'm not going anywhere. he is.  ..  to share.  yay.  yay.   ouch. ouch. ouch. ouch.  aah. aah.  wahoo.  smooth shoots the ball.  flash shoots the kid.   ubetcha: the ball hogs win the championship.  what are you gonna do next.  all: we're not going to alaska.  what am i supposed to do with all these blubber nuggets.  heythey're chewy.  hey.  i mean,  nice new vcube.  is it yours.
