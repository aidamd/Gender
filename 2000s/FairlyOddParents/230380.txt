parents can.  i wish my parents had super powers again and were mighty mom and dyno dad.   well, that was odd.  evil needs fighting in dimmsdale.  i'm chet ubetcha.  in what can only be described as a 10yearold's twisted comicbook fantasy gone awry, dimmsdale is being overrun by superpowered freaks.  who are you callin' a freak.   honey, no. it's too much evil.  aah. there's no time for that.  ..

tights.  hey, why just ask for one of them when i can wish for all of them.  the 1930s pulp fiction chin, the forties world war ii surgeon chin, the fifties squarejawed commie buster chin, the sixties psychedelic chin, the seventies disco chin, the eighties overly muscular weapontoting chin, the nineties grunge chin, and the new millennium crimson chin.  let's get mandibular.  chins: surrender, evildoer.  there's only one way to escape the pain, bunky, and it's in here.  you're right, and you two still have to do what i say.  i wish we were all back in the comic book.  i swear it.  you can't swear.  only the super edgy 1985 crimson chin can swear.  yeah, and i got canceled for it.  crimson chin: you did a great job helping me defeat the negachin, but next time, leave the superheroing to the superheroes, like me.  because you two make a great pair of superparents.  ..  dad:..  mom:..  we've got to go home and punish timmy.  ..  or am i.   thanks for not using your amazing powers to

massive tail fins, huge engine, and twotone paint job, it was the coolest toy car ever.  like that car over there.  uh. holy i'mnotanoldguy.  it's arealstryker z.   . it's not my car.  i have $50.  then it's $50.  and timmy has $50.  then it's $100.  deal.   dad. wait.  man: howdy.  i'm doug dimmadome, owner of the dimmsdale dimmadome, home to the dimmsdale auto show, and i'd like to buy that antique metal deathtrap.  sorry. you're too late.  and i was gonna pay you 10,000 dimma dollars.   which makes you nottoo late.  listen here, missy moomoo.  you deliver that car to my precariously perched cliffside estate, and this here giant wad of money is yours.  i got to get that car back.  dad, can we please play ball now.  in a minute, timmy, just as soon as i'm done fixing up my new soni mean, car.  you don't think he's going to get all crazy about the car, do you.  that's a yes.  and i've immortalized this yes in this painting calledyour dad is all crazy about his car.  and lo, it is done.  cool. can we go for a ride.  if by "we" you mean the car and me, then the answer is yes.  dad, you've spent all week with that car.  can we please do something together today.  you mean like go to the dimmsdale auto show together.  that would be great. you mean i can go.  but it's the dimmsdale "only if you're old enough to drive in" auto show.  it's just for cars and the young adults who drive them, like me.  not you.   auto show, huh.  and now that he's fixed it up, i'll get even more dimma dollars from mr. dimmadork.  man. i never get to do stuff with dad.  it's like he loves that stupid car more than me.  well, he's gonna spend time with me whether he knows it or not.  i wish i was the stryker z.  timmy: cool.  i feel fast and furious.  i feel lucky.  i feel like driving like a maniac.  timmy: yahoo.   oh, you and me in the stryker z    ooh ooh    ohh   hey, look out.   you talk in a nasally voice that reminds me of someone i never spend time with.  ok, whatever. what else can you do.   aah. aaaaah.  just let me do it.   you and me in the stryker z   you can steer yourself.  youarethe coolest car ever.  dad: see the genius car.  it talks, it drives itself,  but it

your hip young lingo, son, but i'd be ever so grateful if i could commandeer your batterypowered transportation vehicle.  you mean my scooter.  whoa, whoa. you've lost me again.  i'll also need your

trunk to tell him to never try a stupid stunt like that.   timmy: aaaah.  ..tada.  dad: hold on, dudes.  you lost me there with your hip young lingo, son.  heh heh. hi, mr. turner.  there's a perfectly good explanation for why i took back my car.  i'm sure there is, but i don't care.  i just shredded my way through my midlife crisis.  i just want my son out of the trunk.  timmy. here he comes.  hurry.   i wish i was in the trunk.  hi, dad. timmy.  what is the matter with you.  you could have been killed.  oh, like you care.  you were only worried about your stupid car.  you never even let me ride in itever.  with its lack of air bags, ropes, seat belts, and pointy metal body, that car is a screaming metal deathtrap.  i'dneverrisk your life by letting you ride in it.  so you were ignoring me to protect me.  i was ignoring you because i love you, tommy.  so i can buy the car back.  it's all yours.  and i'm all yours. come on, son.  let's go play some catch. cool.  ..
