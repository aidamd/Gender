 we can hit tootie with a balloon anda plastic doll.  well, i guess this is goodbye.  you're my best pal.  if you used to like it so much, why are you going to destroy it.  because i don't need this doll anymore.  i have you guys.  still, he was pretty cool.  you know, i wish i could play with him one more time.  hey. i'm toy sized.  there's evil afoot.  ..achin.  wow. you made him alive.  standing next to a lifeless doll would have been boring.  ..  some horror approaches. quick.  to the chin cave.  timmy. where are you.  neat. fairy dolls.  i can add timmy's dolls to my timmy love shrine.  maybe if you took us to your house, timmy would follow you and try to get us back.  what. can't i have an action phrase.  that's a great idea.  the commissioner is missing.  and look at the size of these pipes.  i'm stuck toy sized and my godparents are being taken to vicky's house.  there's only one thing to do.  wow. a timmy turner action figure.  with thumb sucking action. yo.  and look, he's got kung fu overbite.  ow.  what should we do with it.  well, it is an uncanny likeness of our best friend.  let's launch him into mrs. o'leary's yard.  you mean the lady with the pet bees.  we can't do that.   now we can do it.  aaaaahhh.  now i have two of timmy's dolls to add to my timmy collection.  wow. she really has a thing for timmy.  well, sure. he's the bomb.  i read that in a teen magazine.  let's play timmy and tootie in their jungle home.  .. and you're timmy.  cool. i'm the bomb.  mwah. mwah. i love you, tootie.  mwah. mwah. mwah. mwah.  hey. i like this game.  aaahhh.  i'm dead.  did somebody say justice.  aaahhh.   here comes the crimson chin   oof. thanks, crimson chin doll.  you totally saved me.  wonder why i got so bored with you.  check out my dimple. it's huge.  now i remember. your action phrases stink.  come on. we gotta rescue cosmo and wanda.  i eat evil for breakfast.  mwah. mwah.  well, you're just a dumb girl.  that's ok, timmy. i'll wait for you forever.  i'll be over here throwing water balloons at you.  this doesn't seem like a lot of fun.  are you nuts. i'm having a blast.  and look how clean you're getting.  well, time to do my chores.  you trim my hedges, and you cut my lawn.  but these are your chores.  and these are high definition photos of you two sneaking into an "r" rated movie.  ..action.  all this blackmailing is making me thirsty.   my dorky little sister is laughing when she should be down here doing my chores.  i'll fix that.  quick. while she's distracted.  we've gotta get into that house.  i have goats in my pants.  oh, no.  run.  oof.  hey. that's chester's retainer.  man, that got some distance.   without gravity, we'd float into space.  justice, thy name is chin.  all finished.  good thinking, crimson chin.  of all my muscles, my brain is one of them.  you're a cooler doll than i thought.  together, nothing can stop us.  grrrrr.  aahhh. it's vicky's dog.  ] ] do you, timmy, take you, tootie, to be your lawfully wedded wife.  ..  what's this.  two new toys.  well, guess who they get to meet.  not mister hammer.  mister hammer.  yes. mister hammer.  and his friend, mrs. saw.  hi, mrs. saw.  i'm cosmo and this is wanda.  don't you want to be a good host.  no. those are timmy's dolls.  oh, that changes everything.  hey. mr. fire. have you met wanda.  oh, no. he's being torn apart.  chew on your butt, not my friend.  ] what was that.  you know you're only supposed to do that outside, or at timmy's house.  chin. chin.  speak to me.  i'm sorry i got you into this mess.  .. i'll never let anything hurt you again.  ..you're...  ow. you're my best pal.  cosmo. wanda.  i wish i was normal sized.  come on, timmy.  let's get you and your stupid doll and get out of here.  he's not stupid.  he's my friend.  and i should have treated him better.  no.  vicky's stolen timmy's dolls.  now he'll never come over, and he'll never like me.  .  waaaahhh.  maybe he's not the only one you should treat better.  you know, she might be creepy, but she does have to put up with vicky more than you do.  yeah, you're right.  vicky lives here.  i guess when she's not torturing me at my house, she's torturing tootie here.  that's gotta be the worst.  ..hi, tootie.  timmy. hi.  ..  you're only here to take back your stupid dolls and then hit me with another water balloon.  actually, i wanted to say i'm sorry i was mean to you.  ..  a stupid 10 year old boy.  right. and i'm not interested in girls.  ..  he's a stupid 11 year old boy.  ..there's hope.  there's hope.  i should do something nice for her.  make up, you know.  she's not mean. she's just a girl.  it's not her fault.  i'm totally into the idea of you giving me to tootie.  this way, she'll always have a little piece of you she can smother and choke with love.  wow. that was an oddly specific action phrase.  i'm gonna miss you, pal.  i put the "man" in mandible.  tootie, i want you. to have this.  more importantly, i want you to have this and never, ever, ever follow me home again.  oh, timmy.  this is the best gift ever.  ..   ohoh.   vicky: now, where was i.  evil sister. gotta go. bye.  another toy.  .. it melts.  i wish the chin doll was indestructible and had 12,000 "i hate vicky" action phrases.  your icky, redheaded yuckiness cannot pierce the shield of tootie's love.  " .  i wish we were back at the tree house.  that was really sweet of you, timmy.  ..as long as chester and aj don't ever find out about me being nice to a girl, i'm safe.  chester: hey, timmy.  look who's here.  timmy. timmy.  this doll is you, and this doll is me.  mwah. mwah. mwah. mwah.  i love you, timmy.  mwah. mwah. mwah. mwah.  i love you, too, tootie.  mwah. mwah.  .  i got you something,
