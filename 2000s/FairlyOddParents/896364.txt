" " let's see if the paper has any clubs listed.  sewing club. that sounds like fun.  no.  what is it, timmy.  have you heard notsogood things about the sewing club.  no, dad, my sworn enemies to destroy me.  so the sewing club is fine then.  ooh, that's a relief. see ya.  guys, i'm in serious trouble.  crocker, dark laser, and foop are working together to get me.  you got to protect me.   this is terrible.  what is it. are they attacking.  no. i spilled my chocolate milk again.  i call the meeting to order.  keep your voice down, metal head.  mother's getting what she ironically calls " first on the agenda, pick a name for our evil club.  super lame. moving on.  ooh, check this outthe crocker jacks.  what does that even mean.  sorry. you put me on the spot and i panicked.  flipsy and i both want the flipsies.  focus, people.  we need a name that says we're a league of super evil revenge seekers.  that's it.  we're the league of super evil revenge seekers.  works for me.  no one will make fun of us with a name like that.  ah, sport, you've been standing at that window for hours.  why don't you sit down and relax.  i can't relax, because my enemies are after me.  and i can't sit down because the chocolate milk rusted my armor butt.  hi, timmy.   ah. what happened to you.  well, it turns out sewing's not my thing.  what's with the outfit, son.  was "dress like a kook" on your bucket list.  no, dad, it's protection from my scary enemies.  i don't know why you need protection from a breakfast cereal, but, getting back to me, i have joined a skydiving club.  see ya.  the ground is hard.   hello.  it's trixie tang calling to say i love you.  tell us again why you had to dress up to make the phone call. you love me.  what changed your mind, trixie.  you want to waste time asking questions, you little pipsqueak, or do you want to meet me for a romantic date.  uh, sure, trixie. where.  at the junkyard.  in the car crusher.   i would have picked the beach at sunset, but okay.  guys, trixie loves me.  poof me to the junkyard.  uh, doesn't the timing of this strike you as a little fishy.  that trixie tang is suddenly in love with me and wants to meet me in a machine capable of crushing steel.  a little. but i'm in denial.  ah, there she is.  the most beautiful girl in all of dimmsdale.  boy, you really are in denial.  yoohoo.  i'm waiting for you, timmy.   i have to say the flipsies are a little creeped out by this.  we're not calling ourselves that.  oh, timmy.  the fairyclipse is about to happen.  ..  yeah, yeah, yeah, we'll talk about it later.  i'm falling in love.   well, you're falling in something.   you. mr. crocker.  that's right, turner.  and you get an "f" for "fooled you".  crush him, losers.  this is way more complicated than the death ball.  i just have an upsy and downsy button.  i'll handle this.   good job, guys.  wow, what a couple of freaks.  oh, darn it.  there's a run in mother's pantyhose.  cosmo, wanda, help.  poof me out of here, guys.  uhoh.  it's the fairyclipse.  who cares about the fairyclipse.  and why aren't you floating.  that's what i was trying to tell you.  when the sun passes between the fairy worlds and the earth, it blocks the big wands that gives fairies their magic.  and that's why we eat ham on christmas.  poofpoof.  this has nothing to do with ham.  but until the eclipse ends at midnight tomorrow, we won't have any magic.  no.   .  . diaper surprise .  . lalaloopsy diaper surprisefeed your babies water press her tummy .  . now look insidediaper surprise. .  look a magic

yogurt.  best friends.  hoho  what are we gonna do.  well, we could either get squashed like bugs or i could jam my titanium thermos into the crusher.  why do you have a titanium thermos.  because i got sick of spilling my chocolate milk.  also i figured it would come in handy if i ever got squashed by a car crusher.  just save us.       gah. turner's getting away.  to the unsuspecting van.  wait for me.  i lost my magic. tiny legs.  aagh.  wait.    blast him with your death ray.  death ray. on a teacher's salary.  i don't even have fm radio.  aagh.  skydiving's not my thing.  aagh.   ugh, trixie tang has really let herself go.  ground hurts.  okay, not gonna panic.  got to stay calm.  the fairyclipse only lasts until midnight tomorrow.  i can't believe it drained you of your magic.  duh. everyone knows that, timmy.  just like everyone knows you eat a groundhog on groundhog day.  no, you don't.  oh, now you tell me.    hey, punxsutawney phil, no hard feelings.   okay, i may not be able to make new wishes, but maybe i can use some of my old ones.  let's see. a catapult.  that's a good start.  now all i need is some ammo.  i've got marshmallows, a box of feathers.  achoo.  not exactly armed to the teeth.  phil's got my arm in his teeth. aagh.  turner getting away was a bit of a setback, but, on the bright side, our tshirts came in.  okay, we need a new plan to annihilate turner.  anybody. i know.  has anyone ever heard of a venusian faceeating spider.  do they actually eat people's faces.  oh, the face is just the appetizer.   you're the scariest baby i've ever met.  i get that a lot.  anyway, i've got a shoe box full of faceeaters right here.  oops. i forgot to punch air holes in it.  anybody else got a plan.  how about we capture turner in my death ball, fly him to the outer reaches of the galaxy, and drop him into a black hole.  eh, seems a little elaborate.  can't we just make him a sandwich with some bad pastrami.  we'll put it to a vote.  ..   but i'm making the sandwich as a backup.  i can always give it to mother if she gets on my back about the torn pantyhose.   okay, my tree house is now officially a safe house.   what's happening.  fire the catapult.  we can't. poof ate the ammo.  i joined a lumberjack club, timmy.  timber.  oops.  i wonder if there's a hide from the police club.  i've got to get dinklebergs prints on this axe.    help.  hang in there, timmy.  we'll save you as soon as we get our magic back.  that won't be for another 14 hours.  i'm not saying it's a perfect plan.   you guys are calling yourselves the losers.  it stands for league of super evil revenge seekers.  approaching black hole.  we know you're doing that voice.  no, i'm not.   finally, we'll be rid of timmy turner forever.  i'd highfive, but my arms are too short.  turner, do you have any last words before we drop you into the void.  um, can't we just talk this over.  for 14 hours.  no, we can't.  opening hatch.  and i thought his toy dog was weird.  toy dog. that's it.  flipsy.  watch this, flipsy.  aagh.  flipsy. no.  i'll save you.  save him.   i probably should have tied a rope to them.  hang on, flipsy.  daddy's coming. wah.  i probably should have tied myself to something.  later, losers.  yahoo.   i wonder where black holes take you.   bakersfield.  so einstein was right.  turner has my ship.  we'll have to take the bus back to dimmsdale.     oh, i can't believe turner got away again.  on the bright side, we still get the 10% bear attack discount.  we failed. face it.  ..  what's the word.  yes. what is that word.  it's on the tip of my tongue.  no, that's the faceeating spider.  aagh. it's alive. aagh.  it's no use.  we'll never get turner.  even flipsy's lost hope.   good news.  i drowned the spider in a root beer float.  luckily, i got him before he bit me.  wait a minute, i think i know someone who can help us.  someone so hideously evil, she strikes fear in the hearts of everyone she encounters.  legend has it she'll magically appear if you mention her name in a cheap diner.  vicky.   what do you losers want.  we want timmy turner's head on a platter.  and a mango iced tea.  so you want to destroy the twerp and you need my help.  wait, why would we listen to a mere teenage girl.     you're hired.  yes, we'll give you a team tshirt 50 an hour.  keep your money.  i'll help you annihilate timmy for the sheer joy of it.  ooh, i like you.  never look in the eyes.  aagh. i'm blind.  time to whip you wimps into shape.    come on, you losers.    this is very embarrassing.      congratulations, maggots.  you're ready.  excellent.  now what's the plan.  we'll buy a giant flatscreen tv, throw out the tv, and disguise the box as a video arcade to lure turner inside.  then we'll tape the box shut, drag it to the base of mount dimmsdale, and start an avalanche.  and once he's buried alive, we'll dig him up and punch him.  that's just complicated.  and stupid.  it's four against one.  let's just straight up destroy him.  oh, i really like her.  oh, she's a delight.  the eyes.  only half an hour till the fairyclipse ends.  and i can finally poof this groundhog off my leg.  i think he gave me r half an hour.  i'm gonna make it. yeah.  the only way those losers could possibly get you now is if they teamed up with somebody even more evil than they are.  but what are the odds of that.  aagh. vicky.  what are you doing with them.  they brought me in to take you out.  and that's just what we're gonna do, twerp.   aagh.  yaagh.  poofpoof.  you're right, poof.  we have to save timmy.  look. i can blow bubbles.  ooh.  also my kidneys are shutting down.  you n, turner, but you can't hide.   this is for flipsy.  aagh.  aagh.   what have i done.   poison ivy.  aagh.  i give you an "f" for "finished".  or maybe it was two "f"s for "fried foop".  aagh. guys.  how did you get here.  we took the bear bus.    i can't run much more.  how long till the fairyclipse ends.  one more minute, sport.  we're coming for you, twerp.  i have a plan.  the second the fairyclipse ends, here's what i want you to do.    now to grant timmy's wish.    wait, violence never solved anything.  can't we settle this with a game of dodge ball.  ugh. or maybe checkers.  ugh. ah, come on.  that's not how you play.  no.   heh. i got you, twerp.  wait. why do i sound like timmy.  ha, you get an "f", turner for "feel my wrath".  aagh, i thought i destroyed you.  in your dreams, turner.  it is i, foop, who will destroy you.  then you get an "f" for "fat chance".  guys, we did it.  poofpoof.  that was a great idea, sport.  wishing to turn your enemies into timmy lookalikes tricked them into annihilating each other.  oh, is that what we were doing.  i thought we were playing checkers.  also my lungs are filled with fluid.  thank goodness the fairyclipse ended before they got you.  and we won't have to worry about another one for a million years.  well, there is the upcoming aurora fairyalis when the earth's magnetic fields block the big wands for 28 weeks.  and that's why we eat sauerkraut on german unification day.  hey, cosmo's right this time.  yay.  i can't believe we blew it again.  you're fired, vicky.  fine. but i'm coming back with the bear.  if we're going to destroy turner, we'll need a way into his house.  i think the new guy may be able to help with that.   hi, fellas.  thanks for letting me join your club.  what exactly do you guys do anyway.  just give us your house keys and we'll tell you.  hey, there's a spider in my root beer float.  aagh.  my eyes are numb.
