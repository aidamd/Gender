 it's meyour former imaginary friend who vowed i'd make your life miserable.  me and a bunch of your other unwished wishes have captured your family, friends, and your backup friends.  now, you can suffer the lonelinesshi, timmy. it's mesanjay.  i suffered when you left me alone to rot in your headbefore someone left the door unlocked and i escaped. ha ha.   oh, my gosh.  it's dark laser, superbike, and the pumpkinator all in one convenient evil location.  but we got rid of those guys months ago.  what are they doing with gary.  shouldn't they all be in storage.  storage.  jorgen: welcome to fairy wes are stored.  man.  i didn't know i had unwished so much stuff.  your locker got so cramped, i had to give you a bigger locker and then relocate your most violent timmyhating wishes to an undisclosed location.  where. duh.  an uncharted island in the bermuda triangle, of course.  i love the bermuda triangle.  it's my secondfavorite country and my fourthfavorite shape.  it's perfect because we know that no one would be fool enough to go there.  for your own good, stay away from unwish island.  now, be gone.  there it isthe bermuda triangle.  what are you doing.  you can't go to the bermuda triangle.  like jorgen said, only a fooli'm in.  i've even got bermuda shorts.  rescuing my parents, friends, and backup friends should be a snap.  i have you guys plus a closet full of cool stuff i didn't unwish.  like my shrink suit.  it's so full of gizmos and gadgets, there's no way gary can defeat me.  did i mention i played with the suit a few times and broke it.  .   i get bored when you're at school.  hey. don't you still have heat vision.   ow. hot.  that's a yes.  and there's my escape tube system to the uncharted bermuda triangle islands.  let's go to unwish island.  and you said this was a dumb wish.  good idea disguising us as monkeys, cosmo.  i just wanted to scratch my butt without being judged.  wee.  guys, we have to find everyonequick.  all: timmy.  wow. that was convenient.  mom. dad.  . chester.  ..  sanjay. right.  step away from the bars.  our son timmy has set aside his selfish and cowardly instincts.  and has come to rescue us.  yeah.  ..this isn't real, and you guys are all in a dream.  oh, a dream.  that explains it.  i'm having one of those dreams where i forgot to wear my pants.  sweet.  and i'm having one of those dreams where timmy saves me again.  but where is your white horse.  now go home.  go to bed.  and when you wake up, it'll all be normal.  see you in my next dream.  go.  all: bye, timmy.  ha.  and you said a second tube was an even stupider idea.  mission accomplished.  hey, it's the sphinx you wished away.  but i didn't wish it away.  oh.  well, it sure adds to the drama.    i wish the sphinx away.   we can't wish it away.  this is where it gets wished away to.  well, lookityloo.  if it isn't johnny uncool wishaway.  let's see you wish yourself out of this.   and now, prepare for my diabolicalyet

plana duel with your most dangerous unwished wishes, kooky booky boo, after which you will be locked awaylike you locked me away in your headrepresented here by this totally metaphorical jail head.  objection.  timmy doesn't unwish all his wishes.  why don't you give him a fighting chance.  fine.  timmy can bring any of his wishes that still like himha haif there are any.    introducing the largest gathering of evil unwished wishes who totally want to crush timmy.  pumpkinator.  trick or treat.  dark lasercha cha.  sphinx.  superbike.  and super toilet.  aagh. so much clogging.  gary: and in the loser corner, fighting with the vile pinkhatted tutu is mark chang and the founding fathersben franklin, thomas jefferson, and george washington.  must chop wood.  are you telling me .  dude, let's face it, you can be a little harsh.   i'm dead.  buck up, bucktoothed soldier.  it's time to chop some butt.  ..  your face.  maybe i'm not dead.  we rock.   aling.   we wreak.  ..  now that timmy has landed us in the hoosegow, i feel as though i'm not loving him much at all.  same here.  me, too.  you hate timmy, too.  oh, then come on out.  i'm never voting for any of you again.  they may dislike you, but they sure love each other.  you're right.  i'm the common enemy that binds them together.  if you keep me locked up in this jail head, you'll lose the one thing you all have in common: a deep hatred of me.  and although everyone felt lonely and unwished, look at all the friends you have now.  well, we do love this island, and we all really can't stand uncle overbite over there.  i mean, i don't. do you.  yeah. right.  still, we live in straw huts and eat coconuts for breakfast, lunch, and dindin.  what would you say if i could make it all better.  all i need is wanda's wand back and the magic copier.  hooray. yeah.  cowabunga, flipsy.  arf. arf.   what'll it be, sir.  the ihatetimmy burger, the timmy'sajerk chicken sandwich, or the i'dliketoclubtimmy club.  and instead of a tip, you can punch me in the head.  leaving timmy copies on unwish island to serve gary and his cronies was a good idea.  i think they like it.  almost as much as they dislike timmy.  yeah, and the timmy copies ..  wow.  timmy's cleaning so fast he's everywhere at once.  we sure are fortunate to have a son like timmy.  all: at least somebody likes me.  whoa guys, we need some new

inconspicuous.  oh, boy. facecake.  aagh.   cosmo, you need to be more careful about what you change into.  yeah, i know.  it's a good thing my scream spoiled his appetite.  aagh.  cosmo, what's wrong with you.  nothing.  ow.  oh, yeah.  why aren't you a goldfish.  oh, goldfish are so last week.  jackhammers are all the rage.  ow.  don't lie to me.  . what are you talkingabout.   i'm sorry, sweetie.  aagh.  all right, what's going on.  why do you keep changing into the wrong things.  cosmo, ..  you know what.  ah. no.  my figiggly gland is fine.  no, it's not.  cosmo's figiggly gland is far from fine.  what's a gigigglywhoey.  ..  the special magical organ in a fairy's body that allows us to change shape.  oh, give it do us straight, dr. rip studwell.  meow. is cosmo sick.  let me put this to you in terms cosmo could understand.  yes.  oh, no.  if i can't disguise myself anymore, my days as a godparent are over.  i'll have to go back to my old job.  cosmo, i've got good news and bad news.  the good news is i'm due to tee off at 2:30.  uh, hello.  bad news.  oh, right, the part about you.  the bad news is there's only one treatment for figiggly gland failurea figiggly transplant.  but cosmo is an only child.  where are we gonna find a donor.  jorgen: welcome to fairy world maximum security prison.  it is here where we house fairy world's most dangerous, villainous, and smelliest criminals.  you will notice we have equipped all of our prisoners with antiflightandmagic uniforms.  they prevent magic and are both formfitting and slimming.  it's true, yo.  check me out.  i look like one of them teeny little runway models.  exceptin' for my teeth.   and the fact that i'm eating food.  antiwanda.  hey, it's your opposite antifairy.  yes, this is where we keep the truly evil prisonerslike him: anticosmo.  hello, clarice.  who's clarice.   aw, so sorry.  can't see a thing without my monocle.  i don't like this.  anticosmo is the opposite of cosmo.  ..  ..  smart.  relax, child.  i know you're here because cosmo's figiggly gland is going bad.  how do you know that.  because i'm the opposite of you, cosmo, you ignorant boob.  and my figiggly gland is going good.  my days as an antifairy are coming to an end.  our only chance is for jorgen to let me out of here rip studwell can transplant our figiggly glands into each other.  .  let me see.  i don't like you.  and i don't like you.   and stay out.  well, i guess it's back to my old, unmentionably horrible job.  not so fast, cosmo.  if jorgen won't let anticosmo out, we'll bust him out.  but, timmy, fairy world prison is escapeproof.  that's what they said about the antifairy zone.  and i got anticosmo out of there, didn't i.  that was by accident.  and it's the very reason they built this new prisonto keep evil geniuses in.  then what we need is something subtle, and most of all, quiet.   uh, this is subtle and quiet how.  i can't hear you.  i'm sneaking up on the prison.  what's he saying.  aw.  i love you, too.  aagh.  .  timmy: we're gonna use it to tunnel under the walls and get anticosmo out.  . wait. no.   we were on a cloud, you idiot.  .  any other bright ideas.  yep.  timmy: this prison track meet is bound to work.  yeah, they'll never expect prisoners to run away during a prison track meet.  ha.    whoa.  oh, look.  there is anticosmo about to do the polevault.  tally ho.  ha ha. i'm free.  so long, suckers.  oh.  you know, for an evil genius, you'd have thought he'd have taken the time to measure that stick.  why didn't you.  stupidremember.  stupid.  time for plan c.  oof.  timmy: maybe anticosmo can't fly, but we can.  yeah, this plan is perfect.  and now it's not.  cosmo, you ignorant boob.    you ignorant boobs.  you are so pathetic.   pathetic fairies.  oof.   hello.  rip studwell, with bad news and good news.  the bad news is if we don't do the figiggly transplant soon, it's going to be too late.  what's the good news.  i'm 3 under par after 9 holes.  see. at least one of us is happy.  .  we're almost out of time.  hey, this is a diagram and an escape plan.  is it from anticosmo.  let me check.  "dear morons: "yes, this escape plan is from me, " so, who's it from.  this plan is brilliant.  well, he is the anticosmo.  .  hurry up.  bigtoothed laundry man and hairylipped laundry woman, are you ready to leave with your load of "laundry".  yeah. you bet.  so, you will not mind if i violently stick this pitchfork into your "laundry".  no. no, not at all.  can we go now.  well, since your laundry isn't screaming like facecake, sure.  my anticosmo sure was right when he said you'd be so busy looking at the laundry basket you'd never think to look under this thing.  oh, antiwanda, i do love you so much, but you are such a twit.  i feel your pain.  yeah, well, prepare to feel my pain.   this way.  no, this way.  run for the gate.   cosmo, you ignorant boob, it's locked.  yeah, but remember that unmentionably horrible job i said i hated.  that job was being a magic key.  oh.  so many dark locks.  so cold. it's so cold.  yes, yes, let me summarize: cosmo's an idiot, we're very lucky.  now, if cosmo can stay a key for about 5 seconds, we can get out and find our doctor.   tree, knee, flea, letter "g," magic key.  oof.  all: hooray.  you fools.  no one escapes jorgen vonquack.  oof.  aagh.  my figiggly gland.  i must find the antijorgen.   wanda: studwell, we're here with anticosmo for the transplant.  fantastic. i've got good news.  all: and bad news.  and more good news.  the first good news is you just made it.  all: hooray.  the bad news is we don't have time to get to the hospital.  all: aw.  but the other good news is i'm a fairy doctor.   you might want to look away.   if i don't make it, stay away from my wife.  and if i do make it, take mine.  aah.  well, doctor.  i've got good news, bad news, worse news, and horrible news.  the good news is the operation was a complete success, and cosmo is going to be fine.  yay.  look at me. i'm back to normal.  and i got this really cool scar.  aagh. hey.  i thought you were cured.  i am.  i just never get tired of that.  and the bad news is, your insurance isn't going to cover this.   the worse news is anticosmo has escaped.   and the horrible news.  he's on my cell phone for cosmo.  and he called collect.  your insurance won't cover that either.  hello.  yes, i'll accept the charges.  cosmo, old friend, since we both carry a piece of each other inside of us, i see no reason for us to do battle.  but i warn you: don't look for me.  i said don't look for me.  bye, timmy. bye, wanda.  oh. oh, no.  well, that was weird.  for a second, right as he left, anticosmo sounded just like cosmo.
