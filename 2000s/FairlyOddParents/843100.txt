bandits, except that they are a man and a woman, seem to be married, love pencils, and are traveling the countryside in a beatup recreational vehicle.  ..  i never think.  my parents aren't criminals, and they're not the souvenir bandits.  we're not on a crosscountry crime spree.  well, then, i guess i won't be needing this false mustache " i just hope it doesn't interfere with our family vacation to niagara falls.  uh, you know, you can take off your false mustache.  i'm not wearing a false mustache.  right.  look, timmy.  did you know niagara falls is one of the 7 natural wonders of the world.  blah, blah, blah. running water.  we have that at home.  dad: it's also conveniently located right next to the north american museum of pencil pushing.  and, as a professional pencil pusher, it's my duty to journey there and sharpen one pencil in the sacred silver sharpener.   we're going to niagara falls, one of the most beautiful, romantic vacation spots in the world.  yeah, and despite that, i love it because it's partially in canada.  i love canada.  their tradition of peaceful coexistence, their commitment to environmental protection.  plus, they've got a flag with a leaf on it.  wow. a leaf.  i can't wait to get to canada.  ooh. me neither.  that's why we're not stopping for anything.  we're stopping for something.  wait. i don't have to go.  aah.   all: female.  i can't believe we've only traveled 200 miles.  in canada, that's 320 kilometers.  can this vacation get any worse.  we lost 'em, pa.  ..  the souvenir bandits.   except them.  i told you you shouldn't shout our names in the sky like that.  quick, into that eerily identical mobile home.  it's those hideouslooking fiends the turnbaums.  got to hide in this bathroom my dad was too stupid to use.  mom and dad will be back any minute, and everything will be just fine.  man, that was close.  you're under arrest.  i told you not to follow me into the men's room.  quick, wear this false mustache.  get on the horn and tell the chief we've captured the souvenirstealing fiends the turnbaums.  uh, that's pronounced turner.  they've confessed.  who's up for some doughnuts.  i'm worried, honey.  what about timmy.  relax, snugglebutt.  he's safe and sound in an impregnable motor home.  besides, we'll be out in no time.  i'm confident that our american system of justice will see us through.  uh, this may take longer than i thought.  i'm chet ubetcha with breaking news.  the newly mustachioed souvenir bandits have been caught and convicted for a life of paddling.  how convenient.  those cops mistook that hideouslooking married couple for us.  we, the actual turnbaums, are free.  ooh, i did it again, didn't i.  oh, no. my parents are gonna be paddled.  wait. can't i just wish my parents free.  they're entwined in the american legal system.  it would take yearsto ghem ou even with magic.  well, then, i have to somehow get the turnbaums arrested and prove my parents innocent.  i have a plan.  pa: "come see the north american museum " ma: "home of the world's best souvenir: " pa: "home of the world's worst " pa, are you thinking what i'm thinking.  let's go to canada and steal us a sharpener.  darn it.  and let's get there before my parents get convicted.  ..  aah.  we're here, and the greatest country on earth is way over there.  we'll never get there in time.  yes, we will.  i wish we could get to niagara falls faster.  ma: wow. we made great time.   there it is, mathe north american museum of pencil pushing.  security looks powerful tight, pa.  aah. i hate it when billboards lie to me.  now we'll never get inside.  looks like they're gonna need some help.  oh, pooh.  i wanted to write down my home phone number.  ..  what luck, pa.  we gotta follow them.  ooh, this is gonna be a snap.    oh, no. they're gonna get squashed.  i wish there was a second hallway.  you got it.  hey, let's go down this second hallway.  there's no way to open this door.  the only way to get in is to solve ..  uh, motor oil.  crab cakes. green beans.  what. how stupid are these people.  maple syrup, canada's number one export.  ..  eraser.  hey. it was crab cakes.  ah, the heck with it.    i wish we were out of here.  ave to do is wait for the canadian cops.  or, as they're called in canada, mounties.  to nail the turnbaums and set my parents free.  ..  no one will ever catch us, the real souvenir bandits, from escaping over the falls in this rubber raft.  which we stole.  what. but where are the cops.  use my pencil. take my pencil.  come on.  we can't let them escape.  i wish you guys were a super fast speedboat.  pick it up, cosmo.  sorry, timmy, but the water speed limit in canada isaah.  they're getting away.  we're getting away.  wanda, i wish i had a pencil.  i hope i inherited some pencil prowess from my dad.  we caught 'em.  we caught the souvenir bandits.  ooh, somebody should call the americans and tell them to free those two other guys, eh.  cool. now they have to set my parents free.  i couldn't hear you over the roar of the falls.  all:.   i wish i could fly.  i made him a loon, the national bird of canada.  and i made us dodos, the extinct flightless bird of canada.  you idiot. do something.  cosmo.  man: timmy turner, for bravery above and beyond the call of an american child, we present to you our highest pencilbased honorthe bronze pencil.  and for the middlemanaging pencil pusher who brought this child to us, it is time.  ooh. at last.  my lifelong dream realized.  other than being married to you, honey.    now, now, darling, snugglebutt, don't worry. it was just an accident.  besides, i'm confident the canadian justice system will see us through.  uh, this might take longer than i thought.  but in canadian time, that'spa: quiet over there.  we, the real turnbaums, are being paddled.  ma: stop that.  pa: darn it.  .  .  .  .  .  .  capri sun. push play.         hey there.  hi ronald.  bad day, huh.  i'll say.
