move faster, dirty one.  and nag, nag, nag, nag, nag.  jorgen: and so timmy the barbarian, cosmodius the human pack mule..  cosmodius: hating this.  jorgen:..  nag, nag, nag, nag, nag.  went in search

nag, nag.  jorgen: it was a ferocious battle that he could not win.  what.  jorgen: and then vicky crushed the barbarian in her claw, destroying him forever.  aah.  binky: what kind of bedtime story is that.  that's not a happy ending.  it is for me.  oh, ok.  you got any 5s.  nuhuh.  jorgen: now, where were we.  oh, yes, yes. right.  aaah.  ..  aw.  jorgen: don't blame me. it is binky.  curse
