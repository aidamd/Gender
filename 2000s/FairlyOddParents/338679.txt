 that means you never became an official fairy godparent.   . bum bum bum. .  what are you doing.  sorry, that moment was so ominous, i felt it needed a dramatic music sting.  what do you mean i didn't graduate.  there is no record of you turning in your final term paper.  i did turn it in.  i'm as sure of that as i am that timmy's outside building a dam with his dad.  i didn't know you could build a dam, timmy.  then again, i didn't know you had a beaver girlfriend.  i'm not even sure that's legal.  cosmo, if you really think you turned in that paper, then something must've happened to it.  who knows, maybe someone sabotaged you.  you have until the end of the day to prove you turned in your paper, or your godparent days are over.  and since you and wanda are a team, timmy will lose you both.    . bum bum bum. .  sorry, i forgot to do that before i left.  cosmo, we gotta fix this.  i can't lose you guys.  there's only one way to find out what happened to my report.  we have to poof to the fairy world dump and sort through every piece of paper that's been thrown out in the last 100,000 years.  i'm excited to be a part of it.  look, you guys have memory chips in your wands.  we could review your days at the fairy academy to find out what happened to cosmo's paper.  what paper.  that's why we have memory chips.  oh, right, the memory chip.  ooh. now i want chips.   . bum bum bum. .  boy, that's a catchy tune.  i remember it as if i were watching it right now.  i was staying with my uncle harry and aunt potter, living under their stairs.  why were you living under the stairs.  they gave you a bedroom. no.  by stares i meant their disapproving gaze.  i think they were angry because i was living under their stairs.  get out from under the stairs, you weirdo.  cosmo, why are we even watching this memory.  because that was the day i got invited to the fairy academy.    give me that, you stupid owl.   hey, give me that.  ooh, a coupon to get my carpets cleaned.  no, i'm wrong.  that was the day i got a coupon to get my carpets cleaned.  just fastforward.    and there i am at fairy academy.  that's where i met all my close friends with whom i formed lifelong bonds.  .. what'shisname, that guy, her, those people, and the girl with the pink hair.  i wonder what happened to her.  you married her.  well, it's a good thing we split up, 'cause i never would've met you.  welcome to the fairy academy.  i am your headmaster, professor dumblesnore.     thank you, wet willy.  anyway, students, you're about to take a series of classes that will teach you how to be a fairy godparent.    now, students, at the end of the year you'll have to turn in a final paper summarizing what you've learned in all your classes.  without that paper, you cannot graduate and become fairy godparents.  the only paper i'm interested in is the one with your phone number on it.   ooh, i love your laugh.  it's like a goat coughing up a bagpipe.   fastforward.  okay, here's the day when i turned in my paper.  all right, students, we've come to the year's end.  time to turn in your final paper.   ech.  why couldn't i have gotten a dog like a normal person.  here you go, professor.  i think you'll find it both riveting and thoughtprovoking.  this is a coupon for carpet cleaning.  fine, have dirty carpets.  here's my real paper.  whoa. did you see that. i sure did, timmy.  you just sprayed apple juice all over my memories.  no, you did turn in your paper.  but someone stole it.  maybe if we rewind, we can figure out who did it.  you might've made an enemy during the school year.  i think you're on to something, timmy.  in the yearbook i was voted most likely to make an enemy during the school year.  let's rewind back to the first day of school.   hello, i am juandissimo.  what do you say we...  kissimo.  that's flattering.  but i think we should just be frienddissimos.  besides, i kinda have a crush on the pinkhaired girl.  so you are my romantic competition.  i challenge you to a duel for pinkhaired girl's heart.  ahh.  nice glove.  my turn.  carne asada.  morning, class. i'm professor preston changeo.  in this course you'll learn to grant wishes for your future fairy godkid.  i'll turn myself into a child so you can practice.  that's not a child. that's a beaver.  cosmo, you're first. i wish for an apple.  you got it, beaver.  this isn't an apple. it's a creepy clown.  how do you explain this.  well, apples make me think of worms, which made me think of fishing.  and i always fish with a creepy clown for good luck.  last time, i caught a bass.  and i caught a glimpse into my own dark soul.    aww, that's sweet.  you may have won this round, but i will stop at nothing to win wanda's love.  i swear i will have my revengeissimo.  did you see that.  i think we have our first suspect.  you mean the pinkhaired girl.  there always was something fishy about her.  maybe because i put my bass in her backpack.  no, i'm talking about juandissimo.  maybe he took your paper.  i don't know, timmy.  i think we should keep watching.  in this class you'll learn how to disguise yourself from humans who aren't your fairy godkids.  what do you think of this disguise, teach.    oh, look what you've made me do.  now whoever i hit with my arrow will fall in love with me.   oh, no. it's wet willy.  no, your breath smells like bananas.  oh, i'll get you for this, cosmo.   aah.  check it out. suspect number two.  it's clearly the monkey.  timmy's talking about cupid.  timmy's not even here.  he's outside with his dad sharpening his teeth on a sapling.   i don't know why we're doing this, but at least i'm getting fiber in my diet.  anyway, i'm pretty sure it wasn't cupid.  let's check out my next class.  odds are i made an enemy in there, too.  welcome, class.  i'm professor grant awish and i'll be teaching you da rules of fairy godparenting.  there are several rules you can't let your fairy godkids violate.  does anyone know what they are.  you can't take what's not yours.  that's not in the book, but it's a good rule to live by.  actually, i was talking to the creepy clown.  he took my wallet.  i need gas money for my clown car.  the other 40 clowns wouldn't pitch in.  i know a rule.  if a godkid kicks sand in your face at the beach, you cry like a baby.  boy, what a wimp.  i heard that.  i would say, "let's step outside" but my allergies are terrible.  i'll get my revenge in the fall when the pollen count drops.   guys, we have yet another suspect.  you mean the creepy clown.  he took my wallet, but he didn't take my paper.  joke's on him.  all i had in there were more carpet cleaning coupons.  good news, everyone.  you're gonna let cosmo off the hook.  i photoshopped my picture in the yearbook, and now i look fantastic.  in less happy news, cosmo, you only have 15 minutes to figure out what happened to your paper.  it is the start of a long weekend, and the fairy council wants to get a jump on the traffic.  we gotta do something fast or i'll lose you and wanda as my fairy godparents.  .  wait, that's not good.  boys.  froot loops bloopers.  correction...my bloopers.  hang on to your tail feathers.  uhoh.  new kellogg's froot loopsbloopers, part of a balanced breakfast.  that was a blast.  for us anyway...         hey there.  hi ronald.  bad day, huh.  i'll say.  well, it could be worse. ooh.  awesome.   make the gray skies go away   brighten your day with the goodness of apples and milk.  part of your mcdonald's happy meal.     aha.  oof.  weee.  slurp. mmmmmm.  cinnamon. milk. cinnamilk.  cinnamon toast crunch.  part of this good breakfast slurp.  cinnamilk.  this is terrible. what am i gonna do.  it's the long weekend, and i don't have any plans.  although, i was thinking about a lovely drive up the coast.  what's good lately.  i would be more concerned about the fact that your career as a fairy godparent will be over in 14 minutes and 30 seconds.  but jorgen, we have proof that someone stole cosmo's final paper.  really. let us see it.   of course.  that glitchy, sticky image of nothing will totally get you off the hook.  yay.  i was being sarcastic.  well, that makes sense.  i was also voted most likely to not understand sarcasm.  jorgen, it's my fault.  i accidentally spit apple juice all over the memory.  not only did you miss out on the healthy and nutritional benefits of apple juice, you now only have 11 minutes and 28 seconds to find real proof that cosmo turned in his paper.  now if you will excuse me, i have to photoshop my muscular body into a few thousand more yearbooks.  guys, if we wanna save cosmo, we gotta figure out who stole that paper.  it's gotta be either juandissimo, cupid, or jorgen.  let's see if we can find anything in cosmo's memories that proves which one of them did it.  let's check out jorgen first.  he may be the one behind all this and that's why he's railroading you.  that makes sense.  jorgen was voted most likely to work on a railroad.  or get thrown in front of a train.  i can't remember.    look at her. she's beautiful.  who. the pinkhaired girl.  sorry, bro. she's mine.  look at her batting her eyelashes at me.  nope, i'm wrong.  i accidentally squirted hot sauce in her eyes.   ow, it burns.  ahh.  sorry, pinkhaired girl.  ah.  you ninny.  i was talking about the tooth fairy.  i would love to woo her, but she would never go for a scrawny little wimp like me.  see that.  people bring their own sand to school just to kick it in my face.  if only i was strong, powerful, and carried a big wand.  i bet the tooth fairy would notice me then.  jorgen, the tooth fairy's not into biceps, she's into bicuspids.  and i know just how to get her to notice you.  what a handsome bicuspid.  here's a dollar, hot stuff.  as long as you plan on spending it on me, saturday night.  cosmo, thank you.  i am swooning.  of course, that could be from the frying pan to the noggin.  anyway, you're a good friend and i owe you one.  passing out now.  ugh.  so jorgen actually liked you.  i guess that rules him out.   ow.  hey. beaver in timmy's room.  throw us that ball.  i'm trying to play pingpong with my son.  fine.  thanks.  ha.  oh, nice butthand smash.  guys, we have 8 1/2 minutes left.  let's check out the next suspect.    cupid, what are you doing crying inside your locker.  did you and wet willy break up.  yeah, he dumped me for a lemur with a sports car.  let's stay friends. text me.  but that's not why i'm crying.  my problem is i'm supposed to shoot love arrows at people, but i have terrible aim.  watch this.  see. i'm atrocious.  my arrow missed the target and flew into the cafeteria.   i'm in love with my fruit cup.  face it, i'm a total loser.  ugh, if this keeps up, i'll never fulfill my oddly specific dream of being a matchmaker in a diaper.  what am i going to do.  well, there's your problem. you're crosseyed.  wow, now there's only one of you.   i just broke up with my fruit cup.  and now i'm in love with someone from my own species.  i did it. my aim is true.  thanks, cosmo. you're my bff.  best fairy friend ever.  well, cosmo, there's no way cupid took your paper.  the only suspect left is juandissimo.  you are so beautiful that you give the sun a reason to shine.  can you give me directions to your heart.  i seem to have lost myself in your eyes.  and pinkhaired girl, you are not so bad yourself.  how about we go into the janitor's closet.  what.  there is a mirror in there big enough for both of us to admire me.  don't take this the wrong way, but you get away from me, you conceited jerk.  but don't you see.  i cannot get you out of my head.  i'll get her out of your head.    huevos rancheros.  leave what'shername alone.  she's my girl.  oh, cosmo. that's so romantic.  i've had a crush on you since the first day of school.  my name is wanda, by the way.  well, wandabytheway, what do you say we go to the school dance.  that would be fun.  we could double date with wet willy and the lemur.  sorry about the frying pan, juandissimo.  apology accepted.  in fact, i admire your passion for wandabytheway.  you made me realize what true love is, and also that i am more interested in meaningless flings.  you have given me a wonderful gift.  wisdom.  this frying pan with the imprint of my gorgeous face in it.  i am going to make the sexiest omelet ever.  muchas gracias, mi amigo verde.   whoa, juandissimo wasn't mad at you either.  if anyone should've been mad it was me.  he bent my frying pan with his sexy face.  well, if it wasn't him, cupid, or jorgen, then who stole your paper.  all right, cosmo.   time has run out.  since you have failed to prove you turned in your paper, your diploma has been revoked by the fairy council.   . bum bum bum. .  sparky, dramatic music not helping.  that wasn't dramatic music.  there's three bums on your lawn.  . .  anyway, it is a big moment, timmy.  you're about to lose wanda and cosmo forever.  okay, say your goodbyes and do not get all emotional on me.  because then i will get emotional, too.   does anyone have a hanky.  i'm going to miss you, cosmo.  i'm going to miss you too, timmy.   cosmo, that's a beaver.  oh. then beat it.  wait.  i can't let this go on any longer.  i stole the paper.   all: . bum bum bum. .  what do you mean, you stole the paper.  i was afraid that if they read cosmo's paper he'd fail and we wouldn't get to be fairy godparents together.  wow, wanda.  that doesn't show a lot of respect for my intelligence.  oh, my gosh. the beaver's back.  cosmo, that's timmy. oh, you're right.  sorry, timmy. forgiven.  so then what happened.  then they accidentally passed cosmo anyway and assigned us to be a team.  i thought it was all behind me until the fairy council discovered their mistake.  your behavior is outrageous, wanda.  i'm sorry.  i couldn't bear the thought of cosmo and me being separated.  anyway, here's cosmo's paper.  it's kept my hair in place all this time.  there goes my signature look.  wait a minute, this paper is blank.  i wrote it in disappearing ink so no one could copy off me.  smart, huh.  you are right, wanda.  if he had turned in this paper, he would have failed.  i'm sorry, cosmo, but you cannot be a fairy godparent.  both: no.  isn't being a fairy godparent all about making wishes come true.  that's in paragraph three of my paper.  see.  i see you are an idiot.  what is your point, turner.  cosmo's proven he's great at making wishes come true.  while he was at the fairy academy, he made your wish come true to be with the tooth fairy.  and he also made cupid's wish come true by fixing his aim.  and he hit juandissimo in the face with a frying pan.  that is not really granting a wish, but i respect anyone who hits juandissimo with cast iron cookware.  the point is, cosmo was granting wishes before he graduated from the fairy academy.  and as far as i'm concerned, he's the greatest godparent a kid could ever ask for.  that is hard to argue with.  i can't believe i am saying this, but cosmo has made all of our wishes come true.  cosmo, i'm going to demand the fairy council allow you to keep your diploma.   i'm so happy, i'm going to cry.  please don't. you know how i get.   oh, here come the waterworks.   okay, now i'm crying 'cause jorgen's cracking my ribs.  i'm off to see the fairy council.  does it look like i have been crying.  all: no...  i'm sorry i stole your paper, cosmo.  i just didn't want us to be apart.  that's sweet, wanda.  a part of what.  hey, everyone, look at cosmo's graduation picture.  all: yay.  hooray. my diploma.  everything's back to normal.  oh, honey.  i've got good news and bad news.  the good news is, i beat timmy at pingpong.  the bad news is, a forest ranger tranquilized him and took him away in a van.   you probably should've told him to take the beaver in timmy's room.  i'll just net that one and drag him into the woods myself.  okay. now we're going on the run.  all: . bum bum bum. .   did anyone else notice jorgen was wearing mascara.  you can join the fun withconnect and collect minions inside marked boxes of big gcereals.  part of a good breakfast.  rated pg.          hey there.  hi ronald.  bad day, huh.  i'll say.  well, it could be worse. ooh.  awesome.   make the gray skies go away   brighten your day with the goodness of apples and milk.  part of your mcdonald's happy meal.     are you ready, kids.  kids: aye, aye, captain.  i can'thearyou.  kids: aye, aye, captain.  .. .  . who lives in a pineapple under
