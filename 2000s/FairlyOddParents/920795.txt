 even though everyone knows time is relative.  wake up.  wake up. wake up.  huh.  i'm in a.j.'s house.  neato. a sweatervest.  it's a girl magnet.  cool. i have my own clone.  i wish he had a sweatervest.  cool. wow.  this also reminds me of when i was in the fairy scouts.  i remember it like it was yesterday.  this uniform's a little dull.  there. a sweatervest.  or is it a waistcoat.  man: stop.  there are no sweatervests in the fairy scouts.  but it's a girl magnet.  ooh. really.  that changes everything.  hey, there, big boy.  you would think that without the sleeves it would be less of a sweater, but it is actually more.  i got my "more than a vest, less than a sweater" badge that day.   .  yikes. it's a.j.'s dad.  hideyho, smartest son in the world.  cool. a.j.'s dad thinks i'm a.j.  how's my brilliant boy this morning.  hi, smart dad of mine.  i'll bet a smart dad like you knows a ton about camping and would love to help me win the golden acorn.  absolutely.  in fact, i've written 3 books on the subject.  plus, i love big nuts.  so, we're gonna rock the fatherson camp festival.  let's get out there and get dirty.  oh, wait.  is your sweatervest on too tight.  we're not going out there where it's dirty and icky when we can use my virtual camper program.  it's all the fun of camping without the camping.  or the fun.  au contraire.  right now, i'm roasting virtual marshmallows.  if i can get this virtual grill going.   bees.  too many bees.   i guess his program had some bugs in it.   i'll be quiet now.  oh.  this isn't gonna work.  get me out of this sweatervest and back to my house.  oh, this silly grill.  i can't get it to light.  oh, well.  there.  the perfect campfire.  now, who wants roasted marshmallows.  thanks, mom.  gee, where can i find a dad who can light fires and isn't afraid to get down and dirty.  man: you like these kites, son.  hi, timmy.  you bet.  you're the best filthy dad ever.  chester's filthy dad.  he's perfect.  i can't believe i'm gonna say this, i wish chester's dad was my dad.  huh.   chester.  morning.  you ready to rough it, boyto hunt and trap our own food.  you bet, chester's dad.  i mean, dad.  well, then let's go get some breakfast.  so, what you hungry for, boy.  lemur, marmoset.  i'm feeling like some fried meerkat myself.  is this legal.  i don't know, but it sure is easy.  meerkat is a nutritious and fatfree part of any balanced breakfast.  and don't forget, tomorrow we head on over to the dimmsdale aquarium for what i like to call an all you can catch if you don't get caught buffet.  yeehaw.  well, that reeked.  chester's dad is out.  apparently there's more to scouting than just being filthy.  a lesson i learned the hard way when i was a fairy scout.  it seems like it was just yesterday.  come down, kitty.   oh, where's a fairy scout when you need one.   here i amto the rescue.  ah, got you.  now, let me just clean you up, then gently lower you down to your owner.  incoming.    oh, great.  now i gotta clean up the old lady.  and that's how i got my "maul an old lady with a cat" badge.  i'm running out of dads.  well, maybe you should be thinking about using somebody other than a dad.   i don't know but i've been told    my stepdad is good as gold   that's right, a stepdad.  sanjay's stepdad is a disciplined focused marine who's not afraid of anything.  i wish sanjay's dad was my dad.  my nuts.  you are in a restricted airspace.  you must land.     5:00.  who gets up at 5:00.  i did once.  i remember it like it was yesterday.  come on, come on. wake up.  it's 5:00.  this says 9:00, you idiot.  i was supposed to take my medicine 4 hours ago.   my medicine.  ..  medicine.  you got her up 4 hours late for her medicine.  uhhuh.  at first, she was real mad.  then she got real quiet.  did you still get a merit badge.  no, but the doctor did.   i'll be quiet now.  man: son.  permission to enter not needed.  hi, dad.  i can't hear you.  hi, dad, sir, dad.  drop and give me 50.  one, two, 3, 4, ..  46, 47, 48, 49, 50.  too easy.  50 more.  give me another hundred.  was that 191, or 192.  .  i am not good at math.  who do you think i am, soldier, a.j.'s dad.  ..  what comes after 3.  start over.  that's it. i give up.  i'll never find a replacement for my dad in time for the scouting festival.  timmy, could you lend me a hand.  oh, i'm trying to raise this tent i wove out of grass clippings and cat hair, but i need someone to hold my handcarved tent poles.  mom.  stay right there.  careful, don't trip over my solarpowered water purification plant.  uh, mom.  do you have any plans for the rest of the day.  ..  i was going to hang my framed collection of 397 creampuff merit badges, mom, will you be my dad at the fatherson squirrelly scout festival.  that's weird.  but sure.  and we can get there via my authentic preindustrial style maplewood catapult.  wee.  i want to thank you all, and my attorney gloria bowhead who forced you to allow me to be here.  all: hooray.  and i learned a valuable lesson that sometimes the best dad can be your mom.   well, another happy ending.   hey. i remember you.  ..  it was yesterday.  5:00 means 5:00, you idiot.   here comes the quiet part.  mom, thank you so much.  i just wish dad was here to see this.  oh, well, i'm sure he's busy doing something important.
