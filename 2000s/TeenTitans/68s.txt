 beast boy: i think my appendix and my spleen just switched places. adonis: you wimps think you can take down adonis. bring it on. beast boy: dude, it is totally brunged....branged. raven: ooh, bad grammar. that oughta scare him. robin: titans. go.  adonis: you're just making me more ripped. adonis: no pain, no gain. raven: let me go. adonis: you're feisty. cyborg: come on, big man. show me what you got. show me what you got. cyborg: well, okay, then. adonis: nobody outmuscles adonis. beast boy: oh, yeah. well, my muscles may be small and ropy, but they're not...i mean... adonis: what's the matter, wuss. don't you know how to fight like a man. beast boy: i'm not a man...i'm an animal. robin: beast boy, careful. the chemicals.  robin: um...good job. cyborg: nice intensity. raven: yeah. have any good freakouts lately.   beast boy: huh. why is my bed way up there. dude. i should sleep on the floor more often. i feel great. and something smells awesome.  beast boy: ooooooh. robin: beast boy... ...that was...ham...and eggs. beast boy: sure was. robin: but you're a vegetarian. beast boy: not anymore, dude. ever since i stood up to that loser adonis, i feel like a new mana real man. and real men don't eat tofu. beast boy: it's almost noon. you should get some breakfast. robin: that was my breakfast. beast boy: twentyfive... ...twentysix...twentyseven...twentyeight...  starfire: friend. starfire: my most favorite program of the television, world of fungus, is about to begin. starfire: might we please watch. starfire: but you are merely flipping. starfire: hmph. beast boy: fiftyone... ...fiftytwo... ...fiftythree...  beast boy: dude. no fair. you can't do that. cyborg: i can, i did, and baby, that's why i'm gonna win.  cyborg: yo, man, chill. it's just a stupid game.  raven: sorry. raven: on second thought, i'm not sorry, and you're a jerk. raven: is this the part where i'm supposed to be intimidated. robin: beast boy. robin: leave her alone. cyborg: what's gotten into you, man. starfire: you are behaving like a royal zarbnarf. robin: fine. if this is how you want to act, do it somewhere else. none of us are interested.    raven: who's there. raven: beast boy.  robin: raven. cyborg: she's not in her room. starfire: beast boy. robin: what happened. robin: all right, team. we've got two titans missing and no explanation. we need answers, so split up. starfire: i have spotted something. something with claws. cyborg: steering to your coordinates. robin: track it, starfire. we'll be there as soon as we can. robin: raven. cyborg: i lost sight of whatever that was. cyborg: but i just got a lock on raven. she's moving fast. cyborg: she was here just a second ago. robin: no. she was down there. robin: the signal's coming from underground. cyborg: raven's stopped. and she's close by. come on. starfire: oh, i wish to know that our friends are okay now, please. cyborg: join the club. i can't even find bb's signal. robin: it's not beast boy i'm worried about. cyborg: i can't locate the source. robin: then split up.  cyborg: beast boy. i think y'all better get over here. robin: on my way. cyborg: look.  cyborg: raven. robin: attack.  as he gathers himself to pounce, starfire rises to meet him and begins laying starbolts right into the wild face. beast boy runs here and there to avoid the fusillade, then gets all four feet off the ground and catches her in midair. as robin gets to his feet, her yell rings in the chamber and the pair hit he floor nearby. she is raised high and brought down toward the deadly fangs. at the last moment. she swings her legs up and plants the soles of both boots right in his face. he is driven backward, letting her go.)  robin: no. beast boy: where am i. beast boy: why's everybody looking at me like that. cyborg: she's alive, but she's in some kinda trance. robin: she's healing herself. beast boy: and you're telling me...i did that to her. that's impossible. robin: we found you with her. beast boy: no. i wouldn't. i mean, we had a fight, but i would never... starfire: she was in your teeth. robin: i'm going to ask you to keep your voice down. beast boy: what's happening to me. cyborg: i'm picking up traces of recombinant dna. cyborg: it's not human. robin: the chemicals at the lab. cyborg: because of the shapeshifting, his genetic code was always unstable. maybe it's just...finally falling apart. beast boy: raven...she's gonna be all right, isn't she. i mean... ...she's not moving. what have i done. robin: you need to tell me what happened. beast boy: i told you, i don't rememberany of it. we had that argument, i went to my room, i was angry, and then nothing. claws...a scream...nothing. robin: claws and a scream isn't nothing. what else. beast boy: that's all. robin: no, it isn't. you have to focus. beast boy: i am. robin: you have to remember. beast boy: i'm trying. robin: try harder. if you can't tell me what happened, i have to assume the worst. i have to put you in jail. you need to remember. beast boy: i can't. starfire: beast boy. robin: no. starfire: what is...  robin: beast boy. no. robin: bring him down. robin: leave her alone. robin: sleep tight. robin: guard raven in case he comes back. let's go. cyborg: i know you're in there, b. don't make me do it.  robin: sorry, beast boy. raven: beast boy... starfire: rest. you are safe. he can no longer harm you. raven: he didn't hurt me. he saved me. starfire: from what. robin: don'tmove. cyborg: just chill, man. it doesn't have to go down like this. robin: when i move, hit him with everything you've got. robin: now.  cyborg: there's two of these things.    robin: beast boy. robin: adonis. beast boy: so...he was the one who hurt you, right. not me. raven: he broke into the tower to attack you... ...and would up attacking me too. beast boy: i can't believe i ate meat. i acted like a jerk. i'm sorry. raven: you weren't yourself. beast boy: cyborg says the chemicals at the lab messed with my dnaunleashed something...primal. raven: and he gave you an antidote. you're better now. beast boy: yeah. but that thingthat beastit came from inside me. and it's still there. i can feel it. raven: good. raven: if it wasn't for that beast, i might not be here right now. having that thing inside doesn't make you an animal. knowing when to let it out is what makes you a man. beast boy: hmm. maybe you should call me...beast man from now on. raven: we're having a moment here. don't ruin it. beast boy: beast dude. ) )
