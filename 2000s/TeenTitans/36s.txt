kitten: prom is tomorrow, daddy. i don't have time to find another date. so you're gonna find one for me. killer moth: now, kitten, be reasonable. you don't seriously expect me to... kitten: and i don't want just anyone. i want someone handsome, and popular, and totally cool. someone no other girl could get. someone who'll drive fang wild with jealously. i want...  robin: range to target. cyborg: five hundred and closing. should have a visual any... starfire: there he is. raven: correction. there it is. beast boy: superloogie..  cyborg: i can't see.  robin: ah. can't...move. starfire: robin. starfire: he is okay. cyborg: he will be. the venom's effect is only temporary. robin: getting away...we have to...go after him. whoa... raven: you mean, we have to go after him. cyborg: you need to chill till that stuff wears off. robin: but... beast boy: dude, we can handle it. the guy's got a spider for a head. not like he's gonna be hard to find. robin: ooh. ouch. youch. ah. starfire:better. robin: ahh... much. thanks. starfire: i welcome you. there are few problems that tamaranean acupressure will not solve. robin: now we can focus on solving our other problem. titans. any luck finding our jewel thief. raven: we found something worse. cyborg:teen titans. go. raven: azarath metrion zinthos. cyborg: thanks for the lift, raven. booyah. huh. cyborg:uhhhh... we're gonna need backup. robin: we're on our way. killer moth:don't bother. even if you defeat a few of my children, you won't be able to stop me from releasing the entire swarm. robin and starfire: killer moth: unless you want your city reduced to a motheaten wasteland, you'll do exactly as i say. robin: what do you want. killer moth: my demands are simple. the city will declare me ruler, the teen titans will surrender, and robin... will you take this young lady to her junior prom. kitten: hi, robbiepoo. robin:um... what was that last part again. starfire: robin, who is this girl. and why does she call you "poo." killer moth: her name is kitten, and you will take her to prom. starfire: this prom is some manner of duel, yes. robin eagerly accepts. robin:it's not a duel,star. it's a date. starfire: he does not accept. do you hear. robin does not accept. oh. robin: we're going to need a minute. starfire: odium. scandal. atrocity. these demands must not be met. clearly this demented madman has no idea with whom he is dealing. and if he believes... robin: cyborg, report. how bad is it. cyborg: bad. can't hold him off much longer. if you're gonna do something, do it quick. starfire: out of his mind if he believes you would even consider such a distasteful... robin: i have to do it. stafire: what... robin: it's the only way to save the bridge. the only way to give us enough time to stop killer moth. starfire: but, but, but... robin: i have to, starfire, no matter how much i don't want to. and i really don't want to. killer moth: do we have a deal. robin: i'll take the girl to the prom. killer moth: don't tell me. ask her. robin: you gotta be... killer moth: do it... robin: kitten, was it. kitten: meow. robin: right. will you...go with me to the prom. starfire: grrrrrrrrr. kitten: oh, robbiepoo. i thought you'd never ask. raven: azarath metrion zinthos.. cyborg: there's too many. we're not gonna... make it. beast boy: um... what just happened. robin: i bought you some time. killer moth. he's controlling the mutant insects. find him and stop him. start your search with her. raven:who is she. beast boy:huh. starfire: she is a manipulative gremplork not worthy of robin's time. robin: name's kitten. she's got some kind of connection to killer moth. find the connection, and i bet you'll find him. starfire will join you to help with the search. starfire: hmph. beast boy: hey, what about you. aren't you gonna help us. robin: i can't. i have a date.   robin: really hoping she doesn't show. robin: starfire.. starfire: on such occasions, i believe it is customary to wear a dead plant. robin: star... you're supposed to be helping the others track down killer moth. starfire: your orders were to investigate the girl. i intend to investigate her thoroughly. besides you may require saving. this kitten is perhaps some form of ooze monster in disguise. she certainly is ugly like a monster, yes. kitten: yoohoo. robbiepoo. your kitten has arrived. meow. robin: second thought, maybe i will need saving. kitten: oh, robin. my date. robin. don't you look handsome. compliment me on my dress. robin: no. kitten: do it or else. robin: nice dress. kitten: oh, robin. you're such a gentleman. not at all like my worthless exboyfriend fang. now take my arm, lead me in and would it kill you to smile. robin: maybe. kitten: ask me to dance. robin: i don't dance. kitten: come on, robbiepoo. you've never, ever danced before. robin: tried it once. didn't like it. kitten: fine. then i can have the whole city destroyed...or...we can just skip straight to the kissing. robin: wanna dance. kitten: oh, robin, of course i'd love to dance with you. hahahahahahaha. male guest: um... could we have some punch. robin: okay. that's over. kitten: ooh, goody. another slow dance. robin: ow. kitten: from now on, robbiepoo, this'll always be our song. robin: please tell me you guys have found killer moth. cyborg: not yet. but we tracked down your girlfriend's home address. robin: she's not my... beast boy: ah. whoa... raven: well that's not suspicious. beast boy, cyborg and raven: found him. killer moth: yes, you've found me, but you'll soon be wishing you hadn't. rahhhhhhhhhhhh. kitten: kiss me. robin: sorry. i don't like you that way. matter of fact, i just don't like you. starfire: yes. kitten: what... robin: killer moth's being taken down as we speak. we're done here. kitten: no, we are not. daddy's not calling the shots tonight, robbiepoo. i am. robin: daddy. kitten: and unless you want me to let those nasty bugs out for a latenight snack...you better pucker up. starfire: robin: not even if you paid me. kitten: fang. robin: that's your boyfriend.. fang: get your hands off my girl. starfire: keep your legs off my boy. robin, are you injured. robin: best i've felt all day. kitten: fangiepoo. you really do care. fang: let's never fight again, baby. kitten: oh, fang. robin: you know... you two make a really bad couple.  beast boy: for a weirdo who lives in his basement, this guy's pretty tough. robin:huh. kitten: ooh. isn't romantic. they're fighting over me. starfire: they are not fighting over you. kitten: yah. starfire: ah. kitten: ahh. starfire:rahhhhhhhhhhh. kitten:  kitten: you...ruined....my...dress....  cyborg: start talking. how do you control the...moths.. beast boy: run. raven: we can't let them escape. seal the exits. robin: consider yourself dumped. kitten:noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo.. beast boy: okay.... kitten: nobody dumps kitten. nobody. you're going to pay for this, robbiepoo. you're going to paaayyy.. cyborg: so, no second date. beast boy: you know...now that nobody's making 'em all mutatey these worms might actually make good pets. raven: don't even think about it. robin: okay, well...sorry we pretty much ruined your prom. male guest: are you kidding. this was the best prom ever. female guest: even if i still can't move my legs. robin: yeah. that'll wear off. annoucer: and now, the moment you've all been waiting for, the king and queen of this year's prom are...robin and starfire. robin: i guess one more dance wouldn't kill me. ) )
