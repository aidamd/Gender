time you hugged me. beast boy: terra. you're... beast boy: ...i mean, i... ...how's it...heh...wassup. cyborg: well, if it isn't my favorite little rockandroller. terra: cyborg. robin. what's shaking. robin: good to see you again. beast boy: good.. is he kidding. it's great to see you again. i didn't think i'd ever see you again. beast boy: raven, wake up. terra's back. isn't that awesome. raven: super. just help yourself to anything in the fridge and don't forget to lock the door when you leave. terra: actually, i kinda wasn't planning on leaving this time. i'm ready to take you guys up on your offer. i want to be a teen titan. beast boy: uh... terra: got it. sorry. didn't realize the offer had an expiration date. robin: the offer didn't expire, we're just concerned. beast boy: yeah, it's 'cause, well, um, last time when you kind of freaked out and ran away, you didn't exactly...uh...you weren't completely, uh raven: you couldn't control your powers. terra: hello. that's why i left. robin said i needed practice, so i've been practicing. check it out. starfire: glorious. cyborg: whooyeah. beast boy: dude. she really has gotten better. raven: she learned a few tricks. doesn't mean she's any less dangerous.   starfire: ahhh... beast boy: ohhh... cyborg: fantastic. terra: see. i've got everything under control. terra: wasn't me. cyborg: earthquakes. cyborg: small ones, but they're happening all over the city. terra: too many to be natural. robin: that's because they're not earthquakes. they're a trail. robin: something is moving under the city. we need to find out what. titans. go. robin: are you coming or not. terra: does this mean i'm on the team. robin: it means we could use your help. robin: everything okay. raven: can't tell. are you sure it's safe to have her around. robin: not entirely. but everyone deserves a second chance.    robin: you missed the bus. cyborg: looks like you'll just have to take a cab. raven: azarath metrion terra: i got it. terra: beast boy.  robin: good work, terra. now help me get in his face.     raven: no. terra: what are you doing. raven: it's too dangerous. someone could get hurt. terra: i know what i'm doing. trust me.  robin: look out. raven, terra: way to go. robin: come on. it's getting away. robin: slade. slade: robin. good to see you again. i do hope i haven't called at a bad time. robin: the worm. what are you planning. slade: well, now, robin. if you're so very curious, why don't you come down here and find out. act two starfire: that evil worm has left a very long trail. starfire: this tunnel continues for at least two more plinthorgs. cyborg: and we're more than three hundred meters below sea level. cyborg: what's it doing down here. robin: whatever slade tells it to. terra: so, sorry about our little tugofwar back there. you know i wouldn't have let anybody get hurt. raven: whatever. terra: okay, look. i don't know what your problem is, but get over it. if i'm gonna be a part of this team, we have to get along. raven: you're not part of this teamnot yet. and if you endanger my friends again, you never will be. the next time i tell you something's too dangerous, take my word for it. terra: um, why does she hate me. beast boy: ahh, she kinda hates everybody. it'll be fine. raven just needs time to get used to you. i think she's still getting used to me. raven: dead end. robin: not necessarily. robin: i'm picking up a signal from deep inside the rock. cyborg: way deep. electronicsand a heartbeat. robin: slade. terra: how about we dig down there and see what's up. terra: are you gonna give me that look every time there's an earthquake. whoa. robin: titans. ready. beast boy: hello. the good guys are over here. beast boy: dude, we got snubbed. starfire: because we are not their target. cyborg: three of those worms together could wreck anything in the city. terra: we have to stop 'em. raven: we have to stop slade. robin: split up. cyborg, starfire, beast boy go after the worms. terra and raven, we're going after slade. cyborg: star, bb, let's move. terra: i can make a tunnel on my own. shouldn't she go withrobin: no. raven's almost as good at moving earth as you are. we're digging through solid rock. i'm going to need you both. raven: nice try. robin: i've got a fix on the signal. forty degrees down, six hundred meters deep. raven, terra: no problem. terra: is that as fast as you can go. raven: not even close. robin: careful. this rock isn't stable. just take it a little... robin: ...slow.  cyborg: i'll take the ugly one. teen titans. go.   beast boy: guess i won't need to cut my fingernails for a few years.   cyborg: bb. star. we're getting close to the surface. whatever their target is, they're about to hit it with everything they've got.  cyborg: robin. it's the tower. they're attacking titans tower. robin: it's not just under attack. it's about to be underground. act three starfire: our home. beast boy: slade's trying to sink it. cyborg: one drill going up and another going down. if either of 'em break through, we're gonna need a new place to live. starfire: i like where we live. robin: not even a scratch. if we can't break the drill, hacking this computer is our only shot at shutting it down.  terra: robin. hang on. robin: forget about me. shut down the drill. slade: good, robin. now i have you all to myself. terra: looks like it's just you and me. raven: we have to hack in. terra: why hack when you can smash. raven: no. raven: we don't know how this thing works. destroy the controls and we might never be able to stop it. terra: or we might stop it sooner and save our home. terra: why can't you just trust me. raven: 'cause you don't deserve it. i have to meditate every day to keep my powers under control. and i'm supposed to believe that you can just suddenly control yours. trust is something you have to earn. terra: how. how do i earn it. raven: you can start by trusting me. terra: okay. maybe smashing the computer was a bad idea. robin: the tower. slade: going down.  cyborg: beast boy. go.  cyborg: robin, we did it. we took out the drill....robin. cyborg: go. raven: we have to go. there's nothing we can do now. terra: yes, there is. trust me. raven: azarath metrion zinthos. beast boy: no way. cyborg: starfire, look. starfire: i cannot. our home is... starfire: ...saved. cyborg: but how. beast boy: terra. robin: and raven. working together. terra: so...friends. raven: close enough. terra: sorry we kinda got off to a rocky start. raven: actually, i thought things went pretty well. took me a year to stop hating beast boy. terra: um...where are we. raven: your room.  robin, beast boy, cyborg, starfire: surprise.. terra: you guys did all this...for me. beast boy: yeah, since you helped save our home and all we thought you deserved your own room. robin: you also deserve one of these. terra: so i'mrobin: a teen titan. robin: glad to have you on the team. cyborg: aw, yeah. very nice. beast boy: this is the best thing that's ever happened to me. starfire: welcome, new titan. raven: congratulations, terra. you earned it. cyborg: all right. there's only one way to commemorate such a momentous occasion. waffles. robin: mmm. starfire: perfect. beast boy: can they be nondairy waffles. terra: sounds good. i'll catch up in a minute, okay. terra: i don't believe it. they actually trust me. ) )
