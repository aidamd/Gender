a robot too. robin: cut it out. i don't think cyborg would appreciate beast boy: cyborg. starfire: your infiltration is successful, yes. robin: what have you learned. robin: well, find out and get out. the longer you're there, the more dangerous it gets. gizmo: well, what do you know. it's the headmaster's scrumbuffing pet. gizmo: get him. act three blood: no mercy. no mercy.   robin: cyborg.
