 robin puppet: titans. go. robin puppet: hey. robin puppet: aren't you guys coming. raven puppet: what's the point. we can't possibly defeat the puppet king. starfire puppet: he is too clever and powerful, not to mention goodlooking. cyborg puppet: yeah. we should probably just surrender now. beast boy puppet: dude, i think we already have. puppet king: bravo, bravo. but enough rehearsal. time to start the show. opening theme raven: azarath metrion zinthos...azarath metrion zinthos... starfire: raven. starfire: raven. starfire: please forgive my interruption, but have you seen robin. raven: no. starfire: oh. perhaps you have seen cyborg. raven: no. starfire: beast boy. raven: my eyes are closed, starfire, i haven't seen anyone. starfire: they must be doing the hanging out someplace. perhaps we should do the hanging out. we never have before, and conceivably it could be fun. we might journey to the mall of shopping, or perform braiding maneuvers upon each other's hair, or... starfire: you wish to be alone. raven: how could you tell. raven: azarath metrion zinth cyborg: mail call.. starfire: robin. cyborg. beast boy. you are back. it was...quiet while you were gone. raven: not that quiet. beast boy: check it out. this was sitting by the front door. fan mailprobably a gift from one of my many admirers.  robin: actually, it doesn't say who it's from. cyborg: well, one way to find out. cyborg: whoa. robin: cool. beast boy: honestly, i was kinda hoping for chocolate. cyborg: aww, isn't that cute. puppet cy has a lightup eye. robin: yeah. they got all the details just right. beast boy: speak for yourself. i'm way better looking than thisand taller. raven: someone certainly has a lot of time on their hands. starfire: i have never seen such a whimsical device. starfire: hello, starfire. hello, tiny wooden replica of starfire. beast boy: dude. my puppet is totally kicking your puppet's butt. robin: not for long. cyborg: you want a piece of me, little man. raven: boys. starfire: shall my tiny replica do battle with your tiny replica. raven: knock yourself out.    starfire: who is there. beast boy: ladies...please... beast boy: ...one at a time. you'll all get to take your picture with me.  starfire: hello. hello.  starfire: is someone there. starfire: huh. if this is a joke, it is not starfire: raven. you have also heard the strange noises. raven: the strange noises of you talking outside my door. hard to miss. starfire: oh. forgive me, i thought there was someone raven: beast boy, it's me. don't make me hurt you.  raven: let me go. starfire: friends. why do you attack us. puppet king: oh. they're not your friends anymore. puppet king: they are my puppets. these are your friends. all lines marked with one asterisk are delivered in the fashion just described. *** robin: starfire. cyborg: raven. beast boy: help. raven: release them. puppet king: sorry, but you're not in charge here. you don't command me. puppet king: i command you. puppet king: and with the puppet king pulling the strings, the teen titans will command the entire city. raven: azarath...metrion...zinthos. puppet king: my control. puppet king: after them. all lines marked with two asterisks are spoken by the indicated girl, in her normal voice but from within the other's body. stage directions also follow this convention until further notice. *** starfire: the boys. raven. what are we going to raven: starfire. starfire: raven. you are me. and i am you.  starfire: oh, raven. this is awful. terribly, horribly awful. raven: tell me about it. starfire: very well. robin, cyborg, and beast boy have been trapped inside tiny wooden bodies, while a nasty creature called the puppet king has taken control of their real bodies, which he is using to hunt us down, and you and i are in the wrong bodies and raven: starfire. you have to calm down. my powers are driven by emotion. the more you feel, the more energy you unleash. starfire: but what if they find us. what if our friends are doomed. what if i am stuck looking like this forever. raven: we'll fix it. i don't know how, but we will rescue the boys and we will get our bodies back. what's wrong with the way i look. starfire: nothing. starfire: i will try to calm down. peace...quiet...tranquil raven: we are so doomed. starfire: beast boy. raven: you mean zombie beast boy. run. raven: fly. fly. starfire: we cannot fight them again. i do not wish to, and in our present condition we would surely be defeated. raven: okay. how do you fly this thing. starfire: you must feel flight. raven: what. starfire: when you feel the unbridled joy of flight, you will fly. raven: unbridled joy. not really my thing. starfire: look. raven: what do i have to feel to use starbolts. starfire: righteous fury. raven: your alien strength. starfire: boundless confidence. raven: never mind.  starfire: wait for me, please. raven: if i can't fly, you have to levitate. you know those words i always starfire: yes. raven: wait. you have to focus. starfire: azarath metrion zinthos. starfire: i wish to stop. please tell me the way to stop. raven: look at the ground and imagine raven: wait. starfire: ugh. i smell like the breath of a snervian blork worm. raven, what are you raven: shhh. starfire: peace, quiet, tranquility...peace, quiet, tranquility. raven: it's all right. they're going. puppet king: enough. puppet king: we will catch the other two after the ceremony is complete. robin: ceremony. cyborg: what ceremony. puppet king: just a little spell that will destroy you three and make your bodies mine forever. come, my puppets. raven: how can you stand having this much hair. starfire: quickly, raven. our friends are in danger. we must follow and raven: and what. save them with my unusable powers while your unbridled emotions blow us to bits. nice flying, by the way. starfire: at least i am able to fly. on my planet, even a newborn can unleash the joy of flight. but you are too busy being grumpy and rude to feel anything at all. raven: maybe you haven't noticed, but my emotions are dangerous. i can't afford to feel anything. you may have my body, but you know nothing about me. starfire: perhaps you are right. and if you and i are to overcome this ordeal, we must know everything about each other. so...begin sharing. raven: all right. raven: i was born in a place called azarath.  raven: safe to say we're not walking in through the front door. we'll have to try the roof. starfire: agreed. now, do just as i instructed. close your eyes and think of something joyful. starfire: you might choose flowers, or kittens, or the laughter of children, or starfire: very, very good. what was your joyful thought. raven: you don't want to know. starfire: oh, but i do. please tell me. what did you imagine. raven: you not talking. starfire: oh. well...i am glad i was able to help. raven: your turn. find your center. focus your energy on the lock. starfire: azarath...metrion... ...zinthos. raven: nice work. starfire: success. raven: nice work. puppet king: search and destroy. puppet king: i do not want an audience. well, titans... ...time for your grand finale. raven: no. puppet king: it's going to be a real showstopper. robin: stop. cyborg: don't. beast boy: please. cyborg: hey. robin: no. cyborg: stop. beast boy: help. puppet king: don't worry. i'll take good care of your bodies. after all, they'll be mine forever. starfire: my friends. you are unharmed. robin: starfire. raven: it's a long story. puppet king: go, my puppets. capture them. raven: move.  beast boy: dude, get your butt outta my face. robin: can't move. deal with it. starfire: robin, i do not wish to fight you. starfire: but i will if i must. raven: okay, raven. starbolts. just let go of your emotions, feel the righteous fury, and...  starfire: azarath metrion zinthos.  raven: righteous fury, righteous fury, concentrate... starfire: raven, help. raven: starfire. starfire: not me. them. puppet king: the puppet king is in command. raven: no.. puppet king: uh. my control. puppet king: nooooooo..  starfire: i am me. and you are you. cyborg: and we're us. robin: thanks to you two. beast boy: you go, girls. starfire: raven, we have done it. raven: you're hugging me... puppet king: nooooooo.. puppet king: the magic. without it, i'm just a...  raven: azarath metrion zinthos... azarath metrion zinthos... starfire: raven, forgive my interruption, but... raven: i haven't seen robin, cyborg, or beast boy. starfire: truthfully, i am wishing to join you in meditation. raven: really. all right. raven: find your center. raven: focus your energies, and... raven, starfire: azarath metrion zinthos...azarath metrion... raven: starfire. starfire: yes. raven: after this...would you like to go to the mall. starfire: mmmhmm. raven, starfire: azarath metrion zinthos... raven, starfire: azarath metrion zinthos... ) )
