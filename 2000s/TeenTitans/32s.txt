get bathroom breaks. atlas: mechanic. atlas: buff me. spike: you got it, champ. spike: now remember, that cyborg's got a decent left hook. so keep an eye out for atlas: never tell me what to do. spike: heh...yeah, uh...sure thing, chief. cyborg: yo, goldilocks. cyborg: let's do this. atlas: i did not think you would come. humans scare so easily. cyborg: i'm only half human. atlas: and half of nothing is still nothing. mechanic. atlas: i want a fair fight, human, so i shall willingly forgo my arsenal. cyborg: say, tool boy. while you're at it why don't you shut off his big fat mouth. spike: nobody talks that way to  robin: you respect atlas. does he respect you. spike: quiet, human.  robin: yeah. raven: all right. beast boy: all right, cy. starfire: kick the butt. spike: go, atlas. take him down.   now they grapple, atlas slowly pushing cyborg back and making his feet grind the dirt. he looks at his forearm. closeup of the power readout, which has maxed out just as it did in the gym.) atlas: it seems you have reached your limit. but atlas has power to spare. spike: atlas. atlas: no one defeats atlas. cyborg: fine. you win. now let my friends go. atlas: no. spike: but, boss... ...you said that... atlas: your friends will remain as my trophiesand there is nothing you can do about it. beast boy: cyborg. raven: please. robin: get up, cyborg. get up and fight. you can still beat him. cyborg: no. i can't. atlas: fool. did you actually believe you could defeat atlas. i am all robot... atlas: ...and you are only human. act three atlas: victory. atlas wins again. derrick wyatt of east gotham city, i dominate you. raven: give it a rest. you're starting to repeat yourself. starfire: but we must discover a way out. starfire: ow...ow...ow... spike: there is no way out. now be quiet, humans. master's trying to relax. starfire: i am not human. robin: but you are. you should be on our side. spike: i'm on the winning side. atlas is the greatest .no one can defeat him. no one. robin: if atlas is so great, why does he treat you like a loser. atlas: mechanic. oil. spike: coming right up, boss. cyborg: how could i. cyborg: they were counting on me and...i just couldn't do it. atlas was right. i am a loser. reflection: so that's it, man. you're just gonna give up. cyborg: what else can i do. i gave everything i had. a hundred percent. reflection: give more. your friends are in trouble. you have to go back. you have to win. cyborg: i can't win. atlas is stronger. atlas is faster. he's just a better robot. reflection: but you aren't all robot. half of you is human, and that's the half that can beat him. cyborg: time to take it up a notch. atlas: mechanic. more oil. atlas: this is cold, human. bring me warm oil. spike: get it yourself. atlas: what was that. no human tells atlas what to do. cyborg: you sure about that. cyborg: i'm human, and i'm telling you to let my friends go. beast boy: cyborg. robin: yes.  robin: he doesn't respect you. he doesn't even like you. why do you serve him. spike: i have no choice. atlas is stronger than me. robin: no, he isn't. atlas needs you. you're the one who fixes him. you're his strength. without you, he's nothing and he knows it. that's why he pushes you around. atlas is afraid of you. cyborg: still got power to spare. atlas: plenty. atlas: mechanic. concussion blaster. heat cannon. now. spike: no. atlas: then stay out of my way. spike: let's see how far you get without my help. atlas: no. robin: titans. go. robin: you wanted a fair fight. that's what you're going to get. atlas: five against one. this is a fair fight. raven: oh, we're not fighting. beast boy: think of us as referees. cyborg: it's just you and me. spike: yeah, cyborg. take him down. atlas: what's the matter. running out of steam. robin: push, cyborg. you can do it. atlas: you have reached your limit. you cannot win. cyborg: yes...i...can..  atlas: no more. i am defeated. you...are a better robot. cyborg: no. i'm a better person. atlas: mechanic...refit. spike: ah, do it yourself. beast boy: and the winner by technological knockout, the mechanical maniac, the bionic bruiser, the one, the only, cyborg. starfire: i shall express my gratitude with a tamaranean folk song. raven: way to go, champ. robin: guess we better get you a new one of those. cyborg: don't need it anymore. my body may have its limitations, but if i put my mind to it, there's no limit to what i can do. cyborg: after all, i'm only human. ) )
