starfire: she seems quite scared. raven: scared isn't the same as sorry. robin: i don't care how she feels. terra's a dangerous criminal, and she has to be stopped. beast boy: she will be. i'm going to make sure of it. cyborg: got a lock. she's heading east. terra: anywhere. i was getting thrashed, i had to get slade: no. i will not tolerate failure, apprentice. i will not permit you to run away.

where's terra. cyborg: what's the matter. a robot army and a giant frankenthingie not enough for you. beast boy: i don't care about them. i want terra.  slade: you failed me, apprentice. i ordered you to eliminate the titans. you did not. i commanded you to fight, and you ran. terra: you can't treat me like this. slade: can't i. slade: who else would have you, my dear. you've done horrible things. unforgivable things. where else could you possibly go. terra: anywhere but here. i'm sick of fighting, and i'm sick of you. slade: you'll find that quite impossible. the suit's neural interface has integrated into your nervous systeminto your skin. it's part of you... ...and so am i, terra. terra: no. slade: you chose this life, apprentice. it's too late to change your mind nowfar too late. terra: but it's not too late for me to walk out the door. slade: i'm afraid it is, my dear. you see... ...you no longer have any control in the matter. slade: you promised to fight at my side forever.

below the surface. act three  beast boy: terra. terra: destroy me, quick. beast boy: what. terra: come on. isn't that what you came for. do it. now. slade: forgive my apprentice. as usual, she can't seem to control herself. slade: so from now on i will be controlling her every move.  beast boy: what have you done to her. slade: nothing she didn't want me to. terra came to me seeking control, and that's precisely what i've given her. my control, her body. slade: i think you'll find i make far better use of her powers.  slade: that's my good little girl. terra: you have to stop me, beast boy. please. i don't want to fight anymore. beast boy: then don't let slade control you anymore. terra: i have no choice. beast boy: that's a lie. you've always had a choice. beast boy: it's all been your choice. you chose to work for slade, chose to betray us, and now you've chosen to give him control. slade isn't doing this, terra. you are. terra: no.  slade: very good, my dear. now shall we finish him off. beast boy: terra. no. terra: he's too powerful. i can't stop him. beast boy: yes, you can. it's your power, not his. you can still control it. you can still do the right thing. terra: it's too late. robin: stop.. slade: strike, apprentice. now. robin: terra. no. raven: it'll be the last thing you ever do. slade: i gave you an order. slade: do it.. starfire: please, terra, no. cyborg: don't do it. don't do it. robin: listen to us, terra. beast boy: it's your life, terra. your choice. it's never too late to change. terra: sorry, beast boyfor everything i've done.  slade: you ungrateful little  terra: you can't control me anymore.  robin: terra's power. it's triggered a volcano. cyborg: big enough to take out the whole city. and way too big to stop. raven: we have to get out of here. beast boy: terra. come on. we gotta go. terra: i have to stay. beast boy: no. terra: i'm the only one who can stop it. beast boy: please, terra, you can't. it's too late. terra: it's never too late. terra: you were the best friend i ever had.    beast boy: her name was terra. beast boy: she was gifted with tremendous powerand cursed with it as well. beast boy: she was a dangerous enemy and a good friend. beast boy: and she was one of the bravest people that i have ever known. starfire: i shall miss you, friend. raven: we'll be searching for a way to reverse the effect. robin:
