teen titans: trouble in tokyo transcribed by alan back note: translations of japanese lines are in brackets. thanks to all those who put in the effort to straighten those spots out. special thanks to brigit stadler for giving them a final spit and polish. she has pointed out that written japanese does not use question marks or exclamation points, so i have not put them in this transcript. the translations make clear which emphasis is used where. also, the divisions between acts are somewhat arbitrary, since the dvd does not follow the fadeout breaks used when the movie airs on cartoon network. prologue trucker: what are you, crazy. trucker: get out of the way.    robin: since you're new in town... robin: ...we're going to make this very simple. starfire: stop now. cyborg: yeah, man. the locals don't like it when you blow up their stuff. robin: put your hands in the air and beast boy: hands in the air, dude, not your whole body. raven: tourists. robin: titans. go.  raven: anybody got a clue what this genius is after. cyborg: who cares what he wants. what he's getting is a helping of gradea buttwhoop. robin: all right, team. let's see what he's made of.   beast boy: okay. am i the only one who's sick of these explodey things. raven: does this look like a taxi to you. beast boy: nnno. it's way too flat and circley. cyborg: i know you're not throwing that in my car. cyborg: how did he do that... cyborg: aw, man... starfire: uh, excuse me, but i did not wish to do this when you were not looking. robin: you okay. starfire: i am now. robin: then hang on. starfire: but he wentrobin: down a dead end.  robin: starfire. fly. raven: think we scared him off. robin: no. he's headed straight for... cyborg: ...titans tower. cyborg: you're gonna lose a lot more than an arm this time. raven: azarath metrion zinthos.   cyborg: our house. look what he did to our house. beast boy: dude, i need a vacation. robin: who are you. what do you want. saicotek: aa. dame

my car, i can repair my tower... ...but my sofa. i can't even look. starfire: here, here, cyborg. cyborg, starfire: huh. november 21, 2011 at 7:57 pm flag quote & reply gb posts: 376 raven: well, this

brushogun.  robin: this doesn't make any sense. people don't just disappear. cyborg: i don't know what to tell you, man. the crime scanner's one of the only things we got working in this place, and it can't find him anywhere. raven: i can't make psychic contact either. starfire: perhaps this saicotek possesses the power of teleportation. robin: if he could teleport, he would have done it the moment he was caught. beast boy: oh. oh. maybe he just wasn't waterproof. beast boy: i know. not helping. cyborg: so if the dude vanished into thin air, how are we supposed to find him. robin: by tracking down his boss. this brushogun ordered an attack on our headquarters. he nearly destroyed our home. he will be brought to justice. pack your things. we're heading for tokyo. beast boy: sweet. we're

vacation. we're heroes, not tourists. our mission is to locate brushogun and bring him to justice. and since we're guests in this country, we need to be on our best behavior. so let's just do our job and try to stay out of trouble. beast boy: come on. how much trouble could we possibly get in. male voice 1: so, the teen titans have come to tokyo. silhouette: saicotek must have talked. most unfortunate. don't you agree, my friend. but you needn't worry. i will soon give these "heroes" a good reason to leave.  beast boy: tokywhoa. raven: so, where to now. robin: the roughest part of town

whoa. starfire: extraordinary.  raven: don't touch anything. robin: with your permission, daizo, i'd like to use this equipment to complete our mission. uehara: ahhh. certainly, my young friend. and what, may i inquire, is your mission. robin: we're tracking a criminal who calls himself brushogun. uehara: forgive me. but you are ignorant of our culture. brushogun is an urban legend, a myth. uehara: i'm afraid you've come a long way for nothing. as you can see... uehara: ...my troopers have tokyo's real criminals well under control. robin: but saicotek saiduehara: i'm sorry, i don't know who that is. someone is playing a trick on you, perhaps, hmm. robin: i...i'm not sure. male voice 2: commander uehara. mayor: tokyo thanks you. you've saved our city once again. uehara: it is my honor to serve, mr. mayor. mayor: come, commander. the people want their hero and i want to give you another medal. uehara: enjoy your visit. but remember, here you are just tourists. leave the law enforcement to us, hmm.  raven: so... ...this was a fairly impressive waste of time. robin: i don't understand. how could this whole thing be a wild goose chase. i feel like an idiot. starfire: no, please, do not blame robin for the wild chasing of the goose. robin: i can't even find my way around in this town, much less catch a criminal. beast boy: ooh. dudes, i got it. i totally know where we need to go. beast boy: tada. starfire: wakamono shuppan. raven: the comic book place. robin: i thought you were leading us to a clue about brushogun. beast boy: hello. daizo said he's not real, remember. but as long as we're here, we gotta take the tour. starfire: the sign says "closed." beast boy: no fair. robin: come on. let's just go home. cyborg: are you out of your spikyhead little mind... cyborg: we are in tokyo, man. we gotta look around, see the town. beast boy: yeah. after all, that's what vacations are for. raven: whatever. silhouette: they are no longer looking for me, but i will be watching their every move.    cyborg: there it is. the only japanese i need to know. cyborg: "all you can eat".  beast boy: this was the only place in japan i wanted to see. it's like

robin: i know. starfire: then...we have nothing to fear. robin: fear. robin: saicotek was afraid of someoneterrified. and whoever they are, they're here in tokyo. everyone may think brushogun is a myth, but to saicotek, he was real. starfire: but even if he is real, the commander daizo and his troopers can surely handlerobin: well, if they can handle it, then what are we doing here. starfire: i...believed us to be having...the fun. robin: there's nothing fun about looking like a bunch of stupid kids. we're heroes, starfire. we don't take vacations. we don't make mistakes, and we don't have time for starfire: for what. robin: for this. starfire: must we always be heroes. are we capable of nothing else. can we not, for a few moments, be something...more. robin: there is nothing more. a hero is what i am. and if you don't like it... starfire: robin, i like it more than you will ever know.  raven: thirty million people, a hundred thousand stores, and in this entire city, the only
