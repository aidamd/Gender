any kind of trail. robin: but it did leave this. something got zapped. question is, what. starfire: beast boy. cyborg: it's bb's, all right. smells like tofu. starfire: oh, i fear our friend has gotten the zap. raven: he looks fine to me. starfire: beast boy. you are unharmed. cyborg: where have you been. robin: did you get a look at the ufo. raven: ugh. don't make me send you to another dimension. robin: all right, beast boy, quit fooling around. we've got work to do. beast boy. starfire: friend. why will you not resume human form and speak with us. cyborg: maybe he can't. maybe something's wrong with him. cyborg: that's strange. cyborg: yep. definitely something wrong with him. robin: where did he go. raven: and what did he do to that car. driver: my bumper. robin: split up and search. start with beast boy's usual hangouts and fan out from there.     robin: careful, everybody. we don't want to hurt him. raven: speak for yourself. starfire: ugh. what is that smell. cyborg: dogboy here confused me with a fire hydrant. robin: easy, beast boy. cyborg: we just want to help. robin, cyborg, raven, starfire: ewww.. cyborg: ummm... ...oooookay. raven: i'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that isn't beast boy. robin: and if that's not beast boy... starfire: ...then where could he be. beast boy: dude, for the last time... beast boy: i am not your dog. soto: you are funny. soto likes you. beast boy: okay. i didn't want to have to do this, but... soto: you are not soto's dog. you are better than soto's dog. beast boy: oh. uh...thanks. soto: you can change into any pet. any pet soto asks. beast boy: well...i don't like to brag, but... soto: change. beast boy: if i do, will you let me go. soto: mmmhmm, mmmhmm. soto: change. beast boy: uh, hello. aren't we forgetting something. soto: bad dog. soto said, "change." beast boy: and beast boy said beast boy: happy now. soto: change. soto: change. soto: change. you're the best dog ever. and now you are soto's new dog. beast boy: say what.. dude, i am nobody's pet. soto: you...do not like soto's ship. you do not like soto. beast boy: um... soto: good dog. soto: now we go home. beast boy: home. soto: soto's planet, on far side of galaxy. act three cyborg: remind me again why we're chasing this thing. starfire: the creature is not of this earth. raven: and neither is the ufo. robin: the alien ship must have come here looking for the green dog starfire: and captured our green friend instead. raven: so, if we ever want to find beast boyrobin: we have to catch that dog. we need a plan. cyborg: or maybe we just need some bait. raven: what. raven: here, doggie...here, doggie, doggie...  cyborg: sorry, fido. when cyborg builds it, nobody breaks it. raven: so, now that we've got him... robin: ...we just have to figure out how he can lead us to the spaceship. i can run a chemical analysis on his fursee where he's been. cyborg: i can do a molecular scan. maybe he and the ship have the same isotopic signature. starfire: perhaps you could use your powers to communicate with the creature. raven: i'm still getting his drool off my face. i don't want him anywhere near my brain. voice 2: uh, pardon me... dog: ...but i believe we might be able to help one another. robin: okay...am i the only one who heard that. cyborg: you talk. dogs don't talk. dog: perhaps not on your planet, my dear fellow. now if you'll agree to release me, i would be happy to help you locate my odious former master. after i escaped his ship, he pursued me here and mistakenly captured another green dogyour beast boy, i presume. raven: and you didn't tell us this earlier because... dog: i was having too much fun.  soto: engines ready. soto: hang on, new dog. time to go home. beast boy: i am home. now let me go. beast boy: huh. soto: byebye. beast boy: see you. soto: huh. soto: no. soto want up, not down. robin: hang on, beast boy. we're going to get you out. raven: azarath metrion zinthos. soto: no.. new dog belongs to soto. you go now. robin: i'm thinking you're the one who's gotta go. robin: titans. move. soto: soto smash. soto: no..  soto: my dog. cyborg: why didn't you just hand him a laser cannon.     robin: we've hit him with everything and it's still not enough. we need more. we need soto: huh. beast boy: you rang. soto: bad dog. soto will punish.   dog: sit. stay. soto: doggie. you came back. dog: on the contrary. i am only here to retrieve my squeaky toys. i refuse to be your pet any longer. soto: okay. soto will be the doggie now, and you will be the master. dog: what. oh, my. that tickles. soto: woof. woof. beast boy: okay...weird. raven: better him than me. soto: arf. arf. arf. arf. dog: come along, soto. time to go home. soto: bowwow. bowwow. woof. robin: all right, beast boy. raven: welcome back. cyborg: gimme some love, dog. starfire: ah. i am elated to see you. we have all missed you so. beast boy: you guys...really missed me. cyborg: absolutely. who else is gonna help me wax the tcar. robin: and spar with me in the gym. starfire: and eat nauseating amounts of tofu while raven and i watch. raven: uh, how about we all just go for pizza. cyborg: sounds good to me. robin: beast boy. robin: aren't you coming. beast boy: thanks. but if it's cool with you guys i've kinda had enough attention for one day. ) )
