sent that dvd i made of you misbehaving to dr. whipple.   garfield: no.  not dr. whipple.  aah.  i want to watch a really mindless game show featuring people dressed up as large chickens.   jon: i don't care what you want to watch, garfield.  we're going to watch dr. whipple.    as you know, i specialize in teaching obedience to pets, especially cats who don't know how to behave and are lazy, rude, and impossible.   garfield: i hear there are such cats.   yesterday on this show, i showed you one of the worstbehaved cats i've ever come across.  here's a tape of how kittykins used to be.    garfield:  seems like my kind of guy.  in fact, kittykins looks kind of familiar.   since then, i have put kittykins through my nofail, guaranteed pet obedience training, and here he is.      kittykins, would you like to chase this bird.   mm.  naw.    what a wellbehaved kitten.     you see, you can train your disobedient pet with my exclusive line of dvds, tapes, books, computer software, pet ..   jon: don't worry, garfield.  i'm not going to order all that expensive equipment.   garfield: whew. good.  for a minute there, i thought   odie:   jon: come on in. it's open.    garfield: jon, you didn't.  you wouldn't. you couldn't.   odie:   garfield: you did.   come with me, cat.   garfield:   odie:   garfield: farewell, odie.  i'll be back.  but i may not be me when i return.   odie:    garfield:  jon, how could you do this to me.   ah, good morning, cat.   now, if you do as you're told, we can get through this in a hurry.  after several hours of my training, you will be a tame, docile cat like kittykins here.   garfield: why does kittykins look so familiar to me.  huh.   first training method the sound chamber.    garfield:   this will instill in you a sense of warning if you misbehave.    don't scratch.   don't mistreat puppies.   eat what you've been given.  ]  i'll be back in about an hour.   garfield: oh, no.   do what you're told.  do what you're told.   all right, it's an hour later.   garfield:   fine.  we're off to a good start.   garfield:   yuck.   this is to break you of your atrocious habit of kicking small puppies off of tables.  whenever you kick the robotic ..  well, just try it and see what happens.   garfield:   ] that was easy.  ] aah.  i'm not taking this lying down.   ]  .   why, you aah.    oh.    ] ]  i know just how you feel, pal.   and now it's time to eat.   garfield: why do i have the feeling this is the first time ever i'm not gonna like doing that.   right here is your food kitty crunch dry nuggets, styrofoam flavor.  and here is my dinner prime rib with mashed potatoes, gravy, creamed corn, and apple pie a la mode for dessert.   garfield: oh.  yum and double yum.  ]  you must eat your food and not eat my food.  because do you know what will happen if you try to eat my food.   garfield:  yum, yum, yum.   ] oh. ouch. ouch.   that's right.  if you try for my food, a halfton safe will drop on you.   garfield:  so i noticed.  ]  now, make the correct choice.  cat, every time you reach for the prime rib, the safe will drop on you.  don't you realize this.   garfield:   then why do you keep reaching for the prime rib.   garfield: because it's just the way i like it medium rare.   ]  now you've had the complete program.   garfield: and somehow i sssurvived.   you'll be perfectly behaved when we do my tv show in one hour.   garfield: oh, that was awful.  in fact, it was worse than awful.  it would have to get better just to be awful.   hi, garfield.   garfield: hi, kittykins.  hey, how do you know my name, kittykins.  wait.  you're harry, that cat from my neighborhood.    that's me.   garfield: what are you doing pretending to be a tame cat named kittykins.  you're as bad as i am.   i got me a job.  i pretend to be a successful result of doc whipple's training, and every day he pays me my weight in tuna fish.   garfield: he can afford that.   are you kidding.  you know how much this guy makes off these stupid lessons he sells.  make.   enough to pay you your weight in tuna.   garfield: well, that's a lot of tuna.   yeah, play along.  help him sell the stuff, and you could have the same great job i have.   garfield: hmm.  which would i rather have, my weight in tuna every day or my integrity.  oh, these moral decisions are hard.   and now the world's foremost ..  dr. whipple.    odie:   thank you.  today, you will see the results of my greatest challenge the worstbehaved cat i'd ever seen, garfield.   i put him through my extreme housebreaking program.  and now you will see the results.   garfield.    garfield, do you have any desire to mistreat small puppies.     impressive.   do you have any desire to steal food or shred drapes.     that cat has become so well behaved.   we have to order dr. whipple's dvds, tapes, and books.   but we don't have a cat.   ah, very good, garfield.  now, is there anything you'd like to do.   garfield:..  this.   ]  catch him.  ]  garfield: going down.  ]  odie:    that cat is not well behaved.  whipple had trained him not to do things like that.    excuse me, ladies and gentlemen. )
