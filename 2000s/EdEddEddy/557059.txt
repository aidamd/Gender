rolf remembers, yes.    wooly bully.   how'd the heck we get here.  this isn't what i was remembering.    i'm confused, eddy.  you originally were flashing back to something you remembered.  what was it.   i can't remember now.  first, jonny stole my flashback, then nazz, and now rolf.   oh, oh.  i know.  ..  hole in the wall right after a big boom.  remember.   huh.   this ain't the hole.   yep.  you were standing here, and me and double d was here.  see.  zappity zap zap, double d.   unfortunately, i don't think this is what eddy had in mind.   that's it.  from now on, nobody's doing any remembering but me.   those idiots know nothing about cream orange, jimmy.   cream orange is scrumptious, sarah.   eddy.  ed's flashed us back to the day your scam ruined jimmy's teeth.   it's a bowling pin, sarah.  they tricked me.   oh, yeah.  oh, no.  i just remembered the pain sarah will now inflict on us.   ed.  grrr.   eddy, quick.  remember something.  anything.   i can't.  i'm too scared.   um, yes.  remember that time sarah followed us to school.   grrr.   oh, yeah.  i remember.   yeah, you lunkhead.   when we locked her in a locker.   showed her.  ..  she had boxing class that day.   and she inflicted more pain on us.  run away.   weren't we just here.   i think ed just flashed us backwards or something.   you bet your sweet bippy i did.   hey, what'd i tell you.  only i'm supposed to remember stuff.   run away.  the sucking bowling ball.   hey, lumpy's got it right.  he's rewinding us back to the start.   yes, well, just mind your speed, ed.   speed, ed.  that's me.   ed.   where'd we go, eddy.   how should i know.  ..  hey, what happened to me.   this has definitely gone in the wrong direction, eddy.  ed's flashed us back to the day i first met you two.   check it out.  it's my bottomless ed scam.  how'd it go again.  be amazed, kid.  watch bottomless ed eat this humongous tv set.  for you, only a quarter.   ha ha ha.  very funny, eddy.   come on, cough up.  you gotta.  it's part of the flashback.   i've already fallen for this once, thank you.  now, let's get to the task at hand and remember where this ridiculous journey began.  ed and i were at my house, and i was demonstrating the marvels of static electricity.    when sockhead comes to, he won't remember a thing, and he'll pay up just like the day we met.   ha ha ha.  but, eddy, how will we get back to where once from we were.   who cares we're getting cash, buddy boy.  look sharp.   salutations, gentlemen.  my family and i have just moved in, thank you.   hey, ed, get a load of
