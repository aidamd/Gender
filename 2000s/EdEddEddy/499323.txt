'cause it's cool, and i thinkit makes people like you.  how much moneydo you make a year, anyway.  bobby, where did you pickup that kind of talk.  i thought youwanted to talk about money.  i did. quietly and without mentioning any dollar figures.  bobby, only jackasses go around saying how much money they make.  what are you talking about.  julia roberts makes 20 million a picture.  are you calling america's sweetheart a jackass.  it's just vulgar, bobby.  the amount of money a man makes is between him and the professionals down at the h & r block.  peggy: who were we talking to in dallas for 37 minutes.  oh, i remember.   where did i go wrong, peggy.  how did i raise a son who goes around with that filthy moneymouth of his.  he actually had the audacity to ask me how much i make a year.  hmm. i do not know where he would get an attitude like that.  it certainly was not from us.  we raised him to be uncomfortable about anything that personal.  bobby: dad, ladybird's scooting again.  oh, uh... hey, son.  you guys were talking about money, weren't you.  no.  yes, you were.  you were paying bills.  no, we weren't.  we... we were... making out.  peggy..  then what'sthis..  42, eh.  bobby.  let me help.  why. so you can blab to the whole neighborhood how much your mother's haircuts cost.  i'm not a little kid.   now, where were we.  ah...  oh, no.  it was the phone bill.  yep.  yup.  mmhmm.  my boy asked me how much money i make.  the nerve.  the less kids know about money, the less likely they are to rat you out under the pressure of a federal investigation.  i tell you what, it's tough enough to teach a kid to judge people on their character without tv and the mtv filling their heads with nonsense.  tv is an open sewer.  yeah, man, i tell you what, man.  on dang ol'mtv cribs,man, talking about ol' ja rule on there, man.  he got a dang ol' whole refrigerator full of that ol' "crystal" champagne, man.  well, i better head in for dinner.  bobby's probably badgering peggy about how much her wedding ring cost.   so... how much you think ol' hankispulling down.  i'll tell you what, man.  that dang ol' blue truck last year, they don't come cheap, man.   gotcha.  hank: yep, got my check today.  : so. how much was it for.  not to be bobby about it.  hank: a thousand dollars.  : that's right.  you're going to have dinner with the man who made a thousand dollars today.    well, that's a pretty generous bonus.  yep. not quite as good as last year, but people just aren't grilling like they did last year.  boy, last year was something else.  bobby: so, the way i figure it, my dad makes a thousand dollars a day.  that's $365,000 a year.  whoa.  yeah, whoa.  but check it out.  he's been doing it for 20 years.  that's... $7,300,000.  no way.  yeah, and he barely spends a dime, so he's got all that money just sitting around.  what's he spending it on.  our house.   that thing cost a million, maybe two million, tops.  i don't know.  are you sure about this.  bobby: there's got to be something somewhere that proves we're rich.  "oil records".  why is it locked.  because it's about my dad's secret oil wells.  my dad's got oil.  dude, you're rich.  you'reyou'rereallyrich.  iam.  this is so cool.  tell you what, bobby.  let's say we tally ho it over to the money room.  capital idea, dad, capital.  well done, son.  thank you, father.  connie: i don't know, bobby.  we've lived next door to you guys for a long time. )
