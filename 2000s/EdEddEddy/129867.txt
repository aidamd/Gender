i'm sure.  shall we throw caution to the wind and enter this lair ofwatch it.  my brother was a whiz at booby traps.  ha ha ha.  but, eddy, the safe.  i already checked it, double d.  it's empty.  edd: yeow.  can't you just smell his greatness.  i think that is me, eddy.  eddy: look at this.  ain't she a beaut.   my brother said i could have it when i turn 14.  not that it's out of place in this den of dishevelment, but why is there a vehicle sitting in your brother's bedroom.  he keeps his snake in the trunk.  the little weasel must have escaped again.  escaped.  oh dear, oh dear, ohhey, watch the camel.  i said no touching.  i wish i had a room like this.  ahchoo.  dust.  from a camel.  who knows where that thing has wallowed.  air. i need air.  ha ha.  my brother was a whiz

a multifaceted individual, but i did it den i will get it, eddy.  nice and soft, like a kitten.  get your slobbering mouth off my brother's trophy.  oh. oh.  ok, that's it. i protest.  let go, you pathetic excuse for a lump.  oh.  let go.  ed.  i've truly had enough ofread to me what is on the pretty paper, double d.  forget the stupid paper.  find me some stupid tape.  why, i do believe this is a map.  let me see that thing.  it's a map to my brother's secret stash.  we're going to be rich. swimmin' in moolah.  rollin' in hay.  ..  i think it's in greek.  my brother was a whiz at bazuki playing.  yes, well.  it appears to be some form of encoding.  let's dry it out at my house.  my mom has a stove.  what are you talking about, ed.  my stove'll work fine.  oh, please.  the strange thing is all treasure maps have some indication as to its location.  a star, an "x," a cross.  but i don't see anything here.  it's baffling.  do you see one here, because i don't.  this requires careful studying and can only be solved by ingenuity and patient effort.  meet me at my house in one hour.  one hour.  and i'll have your answer to our destiny.  gentlemen.  great.  what are we supposed to do for an hour.  i've got an elastic, eddy.  big deal.   yeowch.  why did you pummel my door with a shovel.  so, where do we start digging, double d.  i concede to your brother's ingenuity.  i couldn't decipher the map.  what.  i tried everything.  i exhausted all theorems.  eliminated all conjecture.  pondered every viewpoint.  but this is one mother of a treasure map, eddy.  you're supposed to be the smart guy.  you're messing with our group dynamic.  it's beyond me, eddy.  he always had it out for me.  he's doing this on purpose, i tell you.  i need that treasure bad, double d.  i think i just thunk.  was that english, ed.  ha ha ha.  let go of me, funnelhead.  ed: "x" marks the spot, double d.  yup.  hmm.  by jove, he's got it.  ed, how did you do that.  because i'm a brother, and eddy's brother is a brother, and eddy is a brother to eddy's brother as a brother i am.  ..  nicely put, ed.  oh, brother.  now, if i were to place this over top of your brother's map, there may be a correlation to the area of its location.  hurry up. i'm startin' to see spots.  i found it.  oh, no.  eddy, according to my calculations, your brother's treasure lies deep within ..  the trailer park.  eddy: kankers.  my brother's a whiz at tickin' me off.  hey, what stinks.  what's goin' on out here.  who the heck are you.  slug him, lee.  shut up. i'm concentratin'.  just construction workers doing their job, miss.  yessiree.  we're repairing a darn broken sewage pipe.  um, so hence the, um, stink.  i've seen this guy before.  lemme see some i.d. there, mr. man.  second kanker: he's so cute.  there you go, miss.  that's me. walter sobchack.  a construction worker.  good enough for me.  yup.  see you later, cutie.  give me a call sometime, wally.   man, that was close.  so what are we waiting for.  let's go get our loot, buddy boy.  can't you see i'm trying to regain my composure.  ugh.  all right, all right.  heavens, ed, please zip up your gym bag.  we're quite done with it.  it's not just a gym bag, double d.  it's a way of life.  shall we resume our quest.  if my interpretation of the map is correct, the treasure should be buried underneath the kankers' trailer.  let's start diggin'.  let's get ed to dig.  this butter should provide enough lubrication in order for you to squeeze under the trailer, ed.  my fantasy come true.  i am buttered toast.  shh.  you want the kankers to hear ya.  now start diggin'.  whoa.  ha ha ha.  ha ha.  ed: ha ha ha.  getting slippery, edd.   edd: ed, control yourself.  ho ho ho.   i bet it's gold.  or roughcut diamonds.   it smells under here, guys.  down, ed. down.  put it down.  what.  go tell those guys to keep it down, lee.  hey, walter.  no sign of 'em, marie.  must be on a coffee break.  this is becoming extremely dangerous, eddy.  let's get the stash and get out of here.  is that you tickling me, eddy.  hey, lee.  get off your rump and run my bath.  get some exercise.  it's good for you.  hey, guys.  ed: i hit something.  ha ha ha. get out of the way, monobrow.  i'm rich.  filthy rich.  lee, give me the strainer.  these clothes are crusty.  aah. aah.  what's going on in here.  where'd you put the treasure, ed.  i don't see it, ed.  over there, eddy.  there you are.  oh, man, i can see it now.  mansions. yachts.  friends.  edd: wishbones.  i'm so confused.  i think your brother's a whiz at pulling your leg, eddy.  looks like we've adopted some groundhogs, eh, girls.  cute chubbycheeked ones, too.  hey. i forgot where i hid these.  what do we do now, guys.  we'll pay you a bribe.
