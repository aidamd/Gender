"or what" is a good question.  but i feel the pipe is a bit much.  yeah, you're right.  it'll distract her from my devilish good looks.  eddy, may i suggest writing nazz a poem.  an ode comparing her eyes to bottomless pools of beauty.  or a sonnet detailing your boundless admiration of her personal hygiene.  haircut.  you guys are clueless.  everyone knows i've got that old black magic.  supper's ready, eddy.  wha.  eddy: you guys got to help me.  what is wrong, eddy.  nazz scares me. the date's off.  forget it. i ain't moving.   hope you're hungry, eddy.  it's my fave.  huh.  aah.  no dressers at the table, eddy.  you're so funny.  psst.  we have to lose the dresser.  ed: i will close my eyes.  help me.  "a" is for helping, which comes from a tree.  uhoh.  "b" is for lifting edd and eddy.  "c" is for grapefruit, which i don't like one bit.  except with cranberry relish and a sprig ofed: she's coming back.  i hope you like my macaroni and cheese.  i made it especially for you.  why

rolf: look, learn, and be amazed, kevin boy.  only in the urban rangers will you learn the craft of ice sculpture.  behold. a chicken.  ooh, a chicken.  stop. do not touch the ice fowl.  i lllove

love pop.  no, wait, eddy.  like a sponge, thirsty i am.  you don't understand.  i haven't tested its stability.  it remains unpredictable.   thatwas predictable. ed, you pig.  freeze, mister.  don't make any sudden movements.  just the slightest twitch may set off the mixture's volatile nature.  and we wouldn't want that to happen, now would we.  ha ha ha ha.  quit it, eddy.  stop.  halt. abstain.  desist.  enough already.  don't have a bird, doubled.   gassy.  you got to blink sometime, you rascal, you.  gesundheit.  aah. oh. oof.  hey, funnelface.  doubled said don't move.  did i go somewhere.  nah. just rest that empty little head, ed.  edd: look. i found a key.  keys have quite a history of unlocking the mysteries of time.  why, just think how tangled one's life becomes by losing something as primitive as a key.  poor soul.  let me see that key, doubled.  i bet that key unlocks big gates of molten lava, releasing the demons from a box of oat bread on the shelf of a mutant truck stop.  oh, edgo get the key.  table for two.   i be this key could open king tut's tomb.  or al capone's wallet.  or some exploited cartoon character theme park.  it's ours for the picking, boys.  pardon my english, but get real, eddy.  i suggest we return the key to its rightful owner.  of course you do.  it's the key to the oyster, doubled.  let's find the pearl.  why, thank you, ed.  does al capone's wallet have pictures, eddy.  lovable oaf.  i hope this sand doesn't get in my loafers.  hey.  honest, mister, i'm just a kid.  i'm broke.  hold still, squirt. i need to see something.  eddy.  mmm. aah.  for pete's sake, eddyjimmy's retainer.  too tight. too tight.  sarah.  this key's useless.  oh, i know.  let me try, eddy.   here we go.   tricky.  i think ed's on to something.  don't you, eddy.  come on, eddy.  someone is really missing this key.  ha ha.  eddy: it's a key.  it's supposed to open something.  that's right, eddysomething dear and personal, like a box of photographs.  or a diary with pages of truth and duration.  or as simple as a locket of love.  it's our responsibility to see this key returns to its forsaken owner so life canmortified. yes.  but i won't let myself fall prey to such shallow emotion.  not now.  there's a fellow human crying for help, trying to mend the unraveled ball of yarn handed to them.  maybe that's the kind of worldyouwish to live in, eddywhere the unyielding and the indifferent supersede the benevolent.  i sayshut up, doubled.  ed, you understand anything doubled said.  pass the mustard.  there's no need to raise your voice, eddy.  you're right, doubled.  i'm sorry.  apology accepted, eddy.  ed, eddy's made a very important first step, andeddy.  my foot apologizes, too, doubled.  careful, as the dogs have had their way with that water pump.  did you see that case.  i bet this key is for that case.  so i feel mankind should reassess its position on the darwin graph before total social abandonment.   you need to eat more fiber, headandsock ed boy.  hmm.  you want to see, yes.  ..yeah, sure, rolf.  it has been passed down many generations.  behold.  it's a whatchamacallit.  not even close,

eddy. there may be a reward.  huh. huh.  like cash.  booty, eddy.  hee hee hee.  i wish i had a turtle shell.  follow my lead.    jimmy: the fall collection screams, "color me bright" at the house of sarah's design.  yes, well, i'm tired of this, jimmy.  don't stop now. you're famous.  i am.  my eye.  who's the wise guy.  it's a note.  huh.  .."
