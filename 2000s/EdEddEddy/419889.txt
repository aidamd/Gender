 uh.  eddy: hey, useless.  put those rings down and take a load off your eyes.  ha ha ha.  very funny, eddy.  but in order to attract a crowd, one needs to demonstrate the use of these archaic arcade games.  is that what you're trying to do.  step aside. let the pro demonstrate.   whak me.  whak me.  wh me.  whak me.  hold still, lumpy, so i can hit you.  edd: bravo. well done, eddy.  you've convinced me.  your skill and expertise in mundane, misleading, and mothridden carnival games makes me want to throw caution to the wind and give you all my money.  you're making fun of me, aren't you.  monster.  i want to be a monster.  look at me.  i am a monster.  waaah.  grrr.  blaagh.  i am just a monster in a boy's body.  if only for a day, i wish i could enjoy the serenity of ed's world.  hey.  blaagh.  ..  wreck everything.  but, eddy, i just want to be a monster.  i was quite enamored by ed's impersonation, eddy.  what are you flapping your gums about now.  humor me.  what if ed
