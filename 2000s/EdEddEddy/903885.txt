this one you may not believe, but your baby can read is changing thousands of lives around the world by seizing a small window of opportunity of accelerated learning in the first five years of life.  i had a chance to sit down robert titzer, the creator of your baby can read.  he shared how effective it was with his own daughter, aleka.   i put 'em in a random order and she still recognized the words no matter which order they were in.  she actually started reading words the she had never seen before because she'd figured out the phonetic pattern.  that's when i knew that this was going to potentially change the way everyone would someday read.   aleka:.. no...  .. thing...  .. nor butterfly...   we actually saw results.  we saw jacob reading words, we saw him interacting with the video, we actually saw him watching the video from beginning to end, without stopping and being distracted ..  ...what's that spell.   jacob.   my daughter began reading by the time she was eight months old.  it has never been work.  it's never been instructional time.  ..and she took hold of the ax and tried to pull it out of her father's hand.
