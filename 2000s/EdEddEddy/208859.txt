what's the use.  no one will ever believe i'm anything more than a rambunctious roughneck.    jimmy: double d.    you've crosspollinated a rose with a babyblue gym sock.   jimmy: only hands as gentle as hummingbirds' wings could have spliced the two together.  i believe you, double d.   edd: you do.  oh, thank you, thank you, jimmy.  if only the others had listened to my pleas of innocence.   jimmy: sounds like you need a shoulder to cry on, double d.  be right with you.   give me the dirt, and don't spare me the details.    edd: oh, jimmy, i'm blurred, bewildered, befuddled at this this melee of misinterpretation.  first, with my book accidently plunging on top of lee's foot a fortuitous mishap, i assured them.  yet i sensed the seed of doubt here.  then rolf.  oh, dear friend rolf.  he was in need of a new pencil, his worn, unusable.  i was only too happy to provide him with one.  why, of course i do, rolf.   rolf: rolf would have taken a simple "no, not today," yes.   edd: another regrettable blunder, as would be the next.   marie: that's my pie.  i saw it first.   jonny: no way.  we saw it first.   edd: remembering mother had packed my lunch with a slice of her heavenly apple crumble pie, i thought the best thing to compose this conflict would be to share it.  to no avail.  once again, my good intentions were cowed by my gawkish demeanor.   ed: stay away.   edd: then came the worst blow of all.  my dearest friend lost his hope and trust because of my stumblings.  enough was enough.  i could see it was up to me to vindicate myself, so in order to do this, i needed to remove the chair that separated our beloved friendship.   ed: aah.  aaah.  uncle. uncle.   edd: can't they see.  how am i to blame.  it's so obvious.  is it me.  but i'm a pacifist.   jimmy: you've been marked with a scarlet letter, double d.  all you need is someone to strip it from you and validate that sweet and gentle you.  follow me, silly.   edd: wait, jimmy.    kevin: weak.   jimmy: you think you're so tough.  i challenge you to a battle royale.  are you aware of the marquis of queensberry rules.   edd:..  i think.  i will make you consume your foolhardy words.  ..at...oh, dear.   jimmy: the pit.   edd: the yes, the pit.  3:00 p.m. yes.   kevin: no way.   jimmy: end scene.   kevin: double d and jimmy are duking it out at the pit, man.  pass it on.   nazz: oh, no, poor jimmy's a goner.   ed: so, little double g, seeing as my old pal double d is now a nasty mcduster knuckles, you are going to be my new friend.  what would like to do today.  i, double g, am gentle, unlike that evil double d you speak of.  shall we talk about fossils and dish soap.   double d used to talk about dish soap all the time.     eddy: move it, slow coaches, or i'll make sure you're next in the pit.   jonny: eddy, sir.   ed: whoa.   eddy: out of the way.  make room.  best friend of the school bruiser coming through.  so move, if you know what's good for you.   sarah: jimmy, are you crazy.  he's gonna turn you into cold cuts.   jimmy: sometimes, a man's got to do what a man's got to do, sarah.   eddy: spare the clichs, twerp.  double d's gonna mop the floor with that curly head of yours.   edd: you still have time to yield to your inevitable fate of losing to me, jimmy.  make haste before i change my mind.   ed: aah.   rolf: jimmy boy is done for.   jimmy: i've got your knuckle sandwich with a side of black eye right here.   sarah: poor jimmy.   jonny: give him the old one, two, jimmy.   ed: this isn't happening.   eddy: that's my boy.  stay on him, sockhead.   jonny: run, jimmy. run.   kevin: quit prancing around and pound him, jimmy.   eddy: what's the matter, jimmy, your curl going limp on you.   jimmy: pardon.   eddy: whoops.  ah ha ha ha.  that mustard looks good on you.  it's yellow, get it.  like you.  ha ha ha.  i got a million of them.   crowd:  jimmy.   jimmy: okay, ready.   eddy: ah ha ha ha.  my bad.  ah ha ha ha ha.   jimmy: stop it.  how can i concentrate with you.   nazz: hey, that's not fair.  uh, never mind.   eddy: bomb's away.   jonny: i don't know where he's getting all those hot dogs from, plank.   eddy: oh, look out, everybody.  jimmy looks like he's gonna blow up.  oh, wait, he already did when we turned him into a su wrestler.  remember.  ah ha ha ha.   jimmy: i hope you're wearing a cup, 'cause you're crme brle, mister.   eddy: yeah, right.   edd: no, no, no.  have you forgotten our mission here.   jimmy: let me go.   kevin: double dweeb's gonna pants him.   edd: stop it right now.   eddy: way to go, sockhead.    sarah: jimmy, are you okay.   jimmy: aaaaaaah.    eddy: do something, double d.  you're the tough guy.   jimmy: what happened.   rolf: hooray.  now the heathen sock tyrant has ceased.    sarah: way to go, jimmy.   together:  jimmy, jimmy, he's our boy.  he'll send you to the trash like a broken toy.   kevin: nice jacket.  dorks.   eddy: what the heck was that.  so much for being the toughest kid in school.  all that respect.  all that reputation, that sweet naugahyde jacket, gone.  you owe me a jacket.   edd: i guess i'm not as boorish a brute as you'd hoped for, eddy.   eddy: bah.   ed: double d.  is it really you.   edd: oh, ed.   ed: double d.   eddy: yeah, double d.   together: eddy.   may: aw, we missed their scrap, marie.   marie: yeah, but we got here just in time to kiss the loser better.   edd: a little late for an entrance, isn't it.   lee:..  you should see the shiner you left on my foot.  clumsy oafs are so cute.   may: they sure are.   marie: pucker up, sweetie.   edd: no, please.   eddy: hey.  he's had enough already.  beat it.   ed: good one, eddy.   eddy: vultures.   edd: goodness, i'm touched, eddy.  you standing up to a clich show ending for me.  let me tell you, after the kind of day i've had, a dose of camaraderie really  eddy: yeah, yeah.   ed: and for your ed, eddy.   edd: eddy, i thought that was my hot dog.  thank you, eddy.   eddy:
