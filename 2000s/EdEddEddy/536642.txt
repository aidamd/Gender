santa claus.  oh, man. how sad.  i need to figure out a way to get these letters to him before he takes off on his sleigh tonight.  have you thought about emailing him over the internet.  i can handdeliver these letters to him myself.  if you want to do it the hard way.  all i got is his post office box number.  how am i supposed to find santa if i don't have his home address.  i have his email address if you want it.  i know. maybe that stupid kid has his address.  hello. i'm right here.  hey, kid, do you have santa's address.  as a matter of fact, i do.  but i'll only give it to you on one condition.  just one.  just one.  .. less than 5, right.  uhhuh.  as long as you don't make me eat bug larva again.  all you have to do is take me with you to meet santa claus.  whoa.  no bug larva.  only if you say no.  all right.  but don't think that i'm a pushover, 'cause i'm not.   : passengers at gate 10, your flight is moved to gate 97.  maybe we can still get a ticket.  or maybe we can secretly sneak on and stow away.  flight 1213, you're clear.  well, that was easy.  i hope this doesn't go on my permanent record.  hey, you know, the last time i was in a cargo hatch, i was bound, gagged, and forced into training for the french foreign legion.   shh. do you hear that.   quick, hide.  man: hello. is someone in here.  i know somebody's here. i heard voices.  are you a stowaway.  no stowaways here. just a lamp and a fan.  ow.  hey, child.   what was that.  you know, you're so dumb, i bet you couldn't even pass a blood test.   and i bet his breath smells so bad, peoples on the phone hang up.   yeah, vince. it's all clear down here.  just a bunch of the animals being stupid.  yeah, well, your mama's so dumb she tried to put m&ms in alphabetical order.  phbbt.

doing for christmas.  christmas. ha.  why would a bunch of circus animals want to celebrate christmas.  hey, circus stuff.  christmas is a time to celebrate the birth of baby jesus. a time for selfless generosity and showing others that you care by spending time with them and giving them presents.  one time, amy gave me a knuckle sandwich.  that wasn't really a present, though.  i can't even begin to count how many times i wished to be back in the wideopen air, living off the fat of the land.  hey, check this out.  aah. oh. aah.   today is christmas eve, and i'm about to make your christmas wishes come true.  lucky for you, a buttercup scout always carries her handydandy pocketknife.  what thecome on. vogue.   if we get caughtparty over here. hey, hey, hey.  aah.   ah   merry christmas.  yeeha.  buhbye. try not to get shot.  at least we have our health.  aw, man. now what am i supposed to do.  time's running out and i got to get these letters to santa.  christmas only happens once a year, and i'm gonna miss it because of a bunch of stupid animals who wanted to live off the fat of the land.  hey, speaking of fat, i'm hungry.  i could go for some tacos right now.  cool beans.  huh. did you say something about beans.  1 adam 12.  roscoe p. coltrane, do you copy.  so are you cooking beans inside there.  ow. bean hog.  b.j. kid convoy, this is little miss thang.  do you copy.  woman on radio: breaker 17 for little miss thang.  this is godzilla.  read you loud and clear.  hello.  according to your homing device, i'm about a mile from your 20.  hey, godzilla.  isn't it about time a fieryvoiced vixen like you had her way with tokyo johnny.  grrrr.  godzilla: i'm thinking you need a lift.  oh, yeah.  can't wait to get an eyeball full of you.  is all that

you sing while you're talking    say yes    say yes    oh, please, johnny, say yes   maybe.  good enough, because you know what they saymaybe's a baby that just needs to be loved till it says yes.

it's me, johnny, remember.  i'm the one that beat you up last year because i thought you were a burglar.  johnny. hold out your hand.  no, i can't say i recall that incident, but from the sound of it, i think that was called for.  merry christmas, mr. claus.  my name'slittle suzy.  you know me.  and leo.  wow. you're good.  ..  i'm a little bit rock and roll.  elvis.  uhuh. it rhymes with shonny.  donnie.  donnie wahlberg from the new kids on the block.  no, sir.  donny osmond of the osmond family.  ok. sounds good to me.  so, johnny, what brings you all the way to the north pole.  i forgot to mail mine and mama's letters to you.  i hope it's not too late.  well, let me see here.  a year's supply of hair gel, a new black tshirt, a brandnew pink cadillac.  oh, johnny, your mama's got a tall order.  wait a second.  that's my mama's list.  oh, it's your mama's handwriting, but it does sound like stuff you would want.  so mama must have asked santa for gifts for me.  besides, i've got your list right here.  whoa. give me that.  but, johnny, we came all the way up here so you could ask santa for your free presents.  yeah, well, things change.  well, johnny, i'm sorry to disappoint you, but i'm afraid i can't fill yours or your mama's orders this year.  all the gifts have been matched to their recipients, and the workshop is closed for the season.  santa, i've got a latebreaking naughty or nice update.  should i pack two more lumps of coal into the sleigh.  yes. thank you, salvador.  johnny, it seems that there are two newly freedup gifts.  uh, santa, if it isn't too much trouble, could you just give both those gifts to my mama.  johnny.  are you sure.  the only wish i have is that you make my mama happy this year.  hey, johnny, while you're at it, could you ask him to help fix our plane so we can get home.  leo, i'm one step ahead of you.  just turn around.  have a safe trip home, and merry christmas.  ho ho ho.  yeah, merry christmas.  so anyways, mama, that's what happened.  i'm sorry that i forgot to mail those letters.  oh, honey, please.  so you're not mad.  nonsense.  the most important thing about christmas is that we're together, honey.  all the presents in the world couldn't replace that.  hey, mama, speaking of gushy stuff, could you make me some chicken pot pie.  all i've eaten today was cookies.  do you hear something.  yeah. that must be my stomach.  it sounds like christmas carolers.   and heaven, and heaven    and nature sing   you're conceited.  what's going on here.  oh, johnny, something cool happened.  leo: yeah, suzy told one person about your selfless act at the north pole.  he told two friends and they told two friends all: and so on and so on.  anyhow, me, along with the citizens of aron city, bravo a merry christmas.  all: and a happy new year.  now, come on, everybody.  wang chung.  my boy looks so happy.  he's a good egg, mrs. bravo.  i only wish he could find that one girl that sees him the way we do.  one can only dream.  you've gotta love her.  hey, mama, did you buy any mistletoe.  captioning made possible department of educahe nationalcaptioning institute ww  . .   . .   male announcer: jedi trapped on
