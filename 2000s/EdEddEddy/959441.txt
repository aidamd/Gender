        listen up.  here's the plan.  we're busting out of this joint.   busting out.   yeah, busting out.  i've had it with this school stuff.  grammar who'sits, math what'sits, science, social studies, geography.  .   look sharp.  teacher, guys.      ok.  here's what we're gonna do.  ..  we make a run for it.   you can't be serious.   shh.   there are severe consequences ..skipping school.   yeah, eddy.  the school will tell sarah, and sarah will tell mom, and mom will tell dad, and dad will just sit there and watch tv.   but just think of it, lumpy.  monster movies, comics, and all the gravy you can stomach.     it's totally worth it, double d.    oh, for goodness' sake.  you can't just run for it, eddy.  a successful escape during school hours will take careful planning with flawless execution.  planning i want no part of.  thank you.   oh, yes, you do, or ed here is gonna write your locker combination on the girls' bathroom wall.   you wouldn't dare.    who sent you.  what'd you hear.   it wasn't me, eddy.  honest.  it's plank.  he wants to escape, too.   no way, jose.   plank says he'll squeal, eddy.   why that dirtylet me at him.  ..i'll...  ok, fine.  but if i hear one peep out of either of you, you're gonzo.   i think i tinkled, plank.      count me in.  curse physical education.  we'll rendezvous at lunch hour.  it's the only time we can move freely about the school.  synchronize your watches, gentlemen.   what watches.   an omen, i'm sure.        ha ha ha.   move it, move it.  so, how are we busting out of this booby hatch, professor.   plank says it's a dragon, right.   a hamburger by any other name would be as cheesy.   keep it down, numbskulls.  we're trying to be sneaky here.   is it a hamburger, eddy.   hardly, ed.  i've constructed your winged wish, your soaring skedaddle, your flying flee to freedom, gentlemen.   wow.   what are we looking at, guys.   ok, break it up.  move it before the screws find out we're missing.  oh, boy, oh, boy.   um, double d.  i was kind of wondering if you'd sign my petition.  it's for, like, cuter guys for school janitors.  wouldn't that be cool.  double d.  are you ok, dude.    we've been made.  it's now or never, boys.   wait.  i'm not finished.  abort the escape, eddy.  this craft is not yet air worthy.   abort.   we're free, baby.  to the culdesac.   pinch me, plank.  we're fugitives.    double d.  what's happening.   oh, dear.  we're losing altitude, eddy.  we're carrying too much weight.   what.   no oversized noggins, jonny.  airline policies.   hey, you.   it's working.  double d.

sockhead.   what was i thinking, eddy.  ..      you haven't got a chance this year, double d.  plank's been training.  ha ha ha.   woth.  respuck.   i can't feel my toes anymore, rolf.  we've been practicing for hours.   what prayer does rolf have ..  too smart for his heart ed boy.   yes, well, good luck, gentlemen.  i'm sure all will be well.  what are you doing to that poor defenseless dictionary.   what's it look like.  ed's cramming for the spelling bee.  feeling smarter, ed.   what.   as proud as i am that ed decided to participate, i fear the competition may be a tad over his, um, head.   ah, don't you worry your little egghead about ed, 'cause you'll be going down in the third round, right.   i beg your pardon.   i made a big bet with kev that monobrow is gonna win in the third.  so stick around a round or two so it looks good.  then bam.  take a dive.   surely you jest, eddy.  how could you ask me to disengage the rules of literacy, to squander the values of scholastic tradition, to spit upon the very foundations of what our language is built on.   so you're saying you won't do it.   what.    good evening.   ladies and gentlemen, dudes and babes, welcome
