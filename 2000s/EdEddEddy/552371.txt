"at rolf's.  "  nazz: dude, aliens or not, something's seriously up.   edd: don't you think you're blowing this out of proportion just a little.  ed's no doubt assisting rolf with some farmyard duties.  it wouldn't be the first time.   jonny: or maybe ed's helping rolf fight off those aliens as we speak.   kevin: yo, put an end to it and just go check his house out already.   edd: well, it hardly appears to be the stronghold of some alien encroachment, now, does it.  is it me, or is it suddenly becoming unbearably warm.   eddy: man, i'm frying like an egg over here.   edd: strange.  how could the land temperature change so drastically from one area to the next.   jonny: see. i told you.   sarah: holy man.   edd: the playground.   kevin: follow me.   all: ugh.   edd: what in heaven's name is that.   kevin: whatever it is, it reeks.   nazz: ahh. ahhh.    kevin: it hatched, man.     eddy: let's make a break for it.   both: ahhh.   eddy: ed.   ed:  squeezed.  cheeks pinched.  ribs prodded.  grizzly beast beings that smell like mothballs.  i am so pooped.   jonny: the aliens experimented on ed.   ed: protect yourself, largenoggined one, as they will use you as an ottoman for their scaly feet.   jonny: no, not the ottoman.   kevin: that's it.  we're storming that house.   eddy: hold the phone.  who made you commander in chump, boxhead.   kevin: oh, i guessyouwant to go in the house first, huh, dorky.   eddy: kev, the leader great idea.   edd: i'll research ed's tawdry extraterrestrial material.  there may be vital clues on how to deal with the alien insurgency.   glorious chaos.  chuckles): go, spik come on. this is a joke, right.  take him a proteus: chittering)  run.  ng) the sweet toothosaur.  no.  he stops at nothing to eat our sweet deliciousness.    raawrgh.      mmmm... gotta have my pops.  oooooh.  fruity pebbles.  yikes.  he's as big as the taste of my post fruity pebbles cereal.  part of a good breakfast.  fruity yum yum.   whoa.  everybody loves the big fruity blast inside every little pebbles piece.    hee hee. bamm bamm.  pebbles.  huh.  sweet.  barney.  my little pebbles.  and your pebbles.hee hee.  iydmllhyfdy  edd: hmm.

out, man.   edd: my information gathering points to alien beings dispersing heat through their vision.   kevin: heat vision, huh.   edd: with that, i took the liberty of developing a subzero battle suit which should effectively protect us from their detonation of heat.    kevin: nice.  jimmy, curlers don't count as weapons.   eddy: hold this.   ed: do it again.    eddy:   edd: eddy, i'm a tad suspect that this will provide you adequate defense.   eddy: defense, schmefense.  i'm gonna be swimming in moola.  once i bag one of those aliens, i'll be famous.   edd: well, just let ed out when you're done, then.   ed: pull my finger, eddy.    kevin: ready.   jonny: ready, right, buddy.   nazz: ready, almost.   ed: don't look at the camera.  don't look at the camera.   jimmy: ready.   sarah:

gaping mouth of uncertainty.  in this, our darkest hour, i wish to express my  kevin: all right, listen up.  these space dweebs made a big mistake invading our neighborhood and taking our pal.  what say we give them a good old peach creek welcome.   all: yeah.    kevin: let's do this.  we're coming for you, rolfie boy.   jimmy:  whoa.   kevin:   sarah: take a whiff of this, you bad aliens.  i did it, jimmy.  whoa. they got me.   ed: ed is coming, baby sister.   eddy: ed, wait.  are you nuts.  those aliens will suck your brain out.   jimmy: ouch.    kevin:   jonny: watch my back, plank.  yeah,

you came, aliens from the unknown.  gutter ball.   edd: i hope you're going to pick those up.   kevin: you guys are useless.  everybody's on their own.  i've had it.   jimmy: my dream.  we'll be sent up into the sky.   nazz: chill out, kevin.   sarah: yeah.  we got to get rolf out of that house.   ed: issue 14, "zombie aliens from planet rhubarb," states more than often it is required to bait said aliens with a human female to lure potential fleshconsuming extraterrestrials from their lair.   nazz: that's so dumb.   edd: dearest nazz, find it in your heart to forgive me.  perhaps it's best to think of it as a selfless act to save       kevin: whoa.   sarah:   eddy: there's so many of them.  i'm gonna be super rich.   nazz: please, don't eat me.   all:   eddy: 7figure bracket, here i come.   rolf: hello, fellow neighborhood nothings.   nazz: rolf.   eddy: geronimo.   rolf: oh ho ho.  you have come to join the celebration.   both: celebration.   eddy: you ain't an alien from outer space.   rolf: rolf's skin weeps with tears of impurity as his relatives turn the furnace up to high.   jonny: that's what he said, buddy relatives.   rolf: relatives, yes.  rolf's brood from the old country.   edd: of course.  it all makes sense now.  rolf isn't literally being invaded by aliens.  it's just his family visiting from his native land.   ed: they are so otherworldly.   rolf: farga and uncle yornik thank you for letting them use your clothes as emergency bibs, lone totempoled boy.  come, fickle friends of the culdesac, join rolf's family in the festivities.  whoa.   rolf: ha ha.  rolf suspects little cousin bastian wants a kiss under the membrane of a yak, she who gives migraines.   sarah: ahhh.   jonny:   rolf: you must stay.  nana sees the footrest potential in your "flat as a pancake" head.   eddy: ahh.  no, let me go.  i don't want to be an ottoman.  help, ed, double d.  isn't it exciting, ed.  we finally have a chance to meet rolf's enigmatic family.  oh, the questions
