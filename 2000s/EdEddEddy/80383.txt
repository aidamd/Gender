 so, where's the cash.  cash.   it's your fault.  why do you encourage him.  ah, shucks. sorry, guys.  my curse didn't work.  but i did everything it said in the comic book.  ed, curses are nothing more than myth and superstition, based only on one's own personal fears.   the crow's migration pattern is nowhere near this location.  it's as though they were summoned to gather here.  but why.

 very good, eddy.  but look closely.  one's mother chute, one's father chute, and, last but not least, my chute.  eddy, my chute has been secretly treated with a silicone lubricant, making it the fastest slide to any basement anywhere.  no fooling.  now, for safety reasons, i insist you use this pillow, eddy.  better safe than sorry.  yeehaw.  woohoo.  eddy, you get back up here and get your pillow.   bottom floordryer lint, paint cans, lonely socks, and mildew.  ...ahh.  and arachnids.  you got peanuts in your basement, double d.  spiders, eddy.  basements make an excellent home for spiders, and mildred is ready for her weekly examination, aren't you, mildred.  did you just wink at me. yes, you did.   don't touch that, eddy.   of misfit failed inventions, nosy parker.  i've

do anything for a handful of granola.  i'm not sure about this, eddy.  ed's parents will surely tell our parents.  haven't you heard of "consequential punishment".  it's the parental ring.  if that's how you feel, i'll let ed know you were too busy to help him in his time of need.  don't worry about it.  the old guilt route, huh, eddy.  works every time.   it is not fair.  and there you have itthe yielding abilities of cement are further explained.  eddy. double d.  eddy: ed.  hello.  ed.  hello.  ed.  hello.  we're busting you out, ed.  i have been a bad boy.  eddy: so, be a good boy.  follow us.  suck in your stomach, ed.  i can't do it.  sarah will find out, and she'll tell mom, and i'll be grounded.  ed, you've already been grounded.  ..i know how to get ed out of here so that even he won't know he's missing.  it's the end of the rainbow, leprechaun.  hand over that pot of gold.  nope. up to the fake rainbow.  that's all you get for one handful, pal.  my fantasycrushed by an imp.

why is ed sitting in a box.  shut up, ed.   and go down the drain.  that's it.  ..  eddy: will you hurry up.  how's it feel to be back on the outside, ed.
