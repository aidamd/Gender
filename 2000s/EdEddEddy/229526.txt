bound to burst.  and postage alone would cost up to $200.  my sumo scam didn't have a chance.  i'm afraid not, eddy.  and you knew it.  did i make you laugh, double d, huh.  honestly, um, i just felt it would be a good learning experience for ..  eddy.  i quit. oh.  no, eddy. don't quit.  i trusted you. i believed in you.  it'll take me weeks to trim these thighs.  you said i was a star.  can i

doubts to the success of using carpeting as a means of achieving virility.   everyone knows hairy pits are a sure sign of manliness, double d.   wow, eddy.  is that a carpet.  ha ha ha.  well, uh, jonny seems unimpressed.   choice.  hey, ignoroid, who's more mature now, huh.  ha ha ha.  the dork's faking puberty.  ha ha ha.  goodness.  jealous.  he wishes he had fur like this.  nazz: is that carpeting.  that's so kindergarten.   i hate it when they catch on.  it seems underarm growth is a poor excuse for maturity, eddy.  so now what.  oh, um, we could call on ed.  don't bother, double d. he is not home.  hey, ed. check out these pits.  nice carpet, eddy.  now, let us see.  position and pose starts by fanning your toes and placing your left foot right.  edd: why, ed.  i didn't know you played an instrument.  in my mom's dreams, i can.  what's ed doing with a ukulele.  that's a violin, eddy.  a handcarved musical tour de force whose delicate tone can emit a diverse range of emotions.  e.  g.  ..  b.  ..  d.  f.  violins are for sissies.  but, eddy.  my mom says i got to practice oredd: thank you.  eddy: hey.  i'm sure you'll agree niccolo paganini is no sissy, eddy.  go on, ed. practice.  revel in the violin's resonance.  get rid of it, ed.   very good, ed, but more allegro.  sprightlier, if you will.   whoohoo. that's a real toetapper, ed.  you're giving me and plank goose bumps.  edd: bravo, ed.   ahha.  i was right. ed stinks.  oh, come on, eddy.  this is a good thing, and ed needs our support.  it sounds like a trapped cat.  and that's why ed shouldposition and pose starts by fanning your toes.  wait, eddy.  don't interfere with cultural learning.   oh, dear.  it's like an elephant's off your back, huh, lumpy.  tell me a story, eddy.  sarah: ed.  you're supposed to be practicing.  mom said so.  i am so confused.  get out of my room, you twerp.  move it.  eddy, sarah's here.  see, i am practicing, sarah.  hang on to your hat.   that's repulsive.   you're as sly as a fox, girlfriend.  call me if there's any trouble.  eddy: that's it.  i'm smashing that thing into a thousand pieces.  aah.  no, eddy.  quit butting in.  we seem to have company, eddy.  a direct line to sarah, should anything go amiss.  really.  come on, edd.  let's find a quiet spot and tune that violin.  ha ha ha.  ha ha ha.  ok, ed. let me have it.  man, he's deaf.  underneath the bitter rind lies a sweet and succulent fruit, eddy.  i hate violins.  practice i must, or sarah, my head will bust.  ahem.   jimmy: aah.  eddy.  eddy: i hate violins.  don't you dare, eddy.  that instrument has a legacy.  and 4 strings.  position and pose starts by fanning your toes and placing your left foot right.  ooh.  eddy, wait.  the walls have eyes.  eddy: i told you to stay out of it.  it's toast.  but, eddyzip it.  very well then.  succumb to your lowbrow tactics.  so shut up already.  but before you violate the violin, eddy, look up into that tree.   um, ed, shouldn't you be practicing.  look at the size of that bird.  jimmy: aah.  oh, it is twitching.  ha ha ha. ha ha ha.  let's use a chain saw.  no, eddy. think of the consequences.  what if an accident were to befall ed's violin, and what if thisaccident were to happen in plain view for sarah et al. to see.  oh, i get it.  what do i get.    what is this.  why is the lady of liberty looming over the culdesac.  what an eyesore.  oh, come on, guys.  i think it's cute.  this better make me happy, double d.  we'll all have our wish come true after this, eddy.  ha ha ha.  position and pose starts by fanning your toes and placing your left foot right.   ed, you're giving me a headache, dude.  save yourself, double d, old boy, as the fiendish fiddler of the mountain toys with our mortality.  hey, jonny boy.  hiya, eddy.  hey, porcupine.  i want you to meet my pal, sawtooth cecil.  look out, plank.  i'll save you, buddy.  jonny: back off, sawtooth cecil, you bully.  whoa.  ouch.  whoa.  aah.  quick. let's go

precise, rigorous, and painstaking.  uh, this goes beyond science, eddy.  an unfathomable force has sent us a clear message that the violin shall not be harmed, uh, that the violin shall be played and produce wonderfulit was you.  me. ha.  why, that's the silliest thing i've ever heard.  that's it.  the stupid violin's toast.   excuse me, ed.  ok. fine. i confess.  it was i that sabotaged the plan.  i had to, don't you see.  how could i just let you deface this exceptional display of man's contribution to the symphonic arts.  eddy: you doublecrosser.  wait till i get my hands on you.  oh, dear.  ha ha ha.  what have i done.  jimmy: egads. i'm telling sarah.   i know what you did    you're in big trouble   no, don't tell, little buddy.  ah, good riddance.  violins are for sissies.  why, if i played an instrument, i'd get something manly, like a kazoo or something.  what.   uh, eddy, sarah's here.  eddy: pound double d. he did it.  edd: no way.  you started this.  no, no. wait.  sarah: ed,
