   chromastone: it is done.  i go now to fulfill my destiny.   diamondhead: i didn't know chromastone could fly.   tetrax: he can do far more than that.   gwen: why don't you tell us all about it.   diamondhead: after we put me back together.    kevin: okay, that's pretty much all of you.   diamondhead:"prettymuch".   kevin: it's all we could find.   gwen: wait.  what are you gonna do with that.   kevin: change him back.   diamondhead: we don't know what'll happen if i transform when i'm in pieces like this.   kevin: doesn't matter.  eventually, it's gonna time out anyway.  everything where it's supposed to be.   ben: ahchoo.  just like before.  how does a siliconbased lifeform get a cold, anyway.   tetrax:i'venever had one.   kevin: from touching doorknobs.  doorknobs and keyboards are covered with germs.   ben: that wasn't what i never mind.   gwen: what do we do with tetrax.   ben: let him go.  he's about to start explaining himself, right.   tetrax: i'm sorry i upset you, ben.  this was the only way i could redeem myself.   gwen: for helping vilgax.   tetrax: for betraying my people.  for it was i, and i alone, who sold vilgax a sacred crystal with unlimited power.  a power he used to destroy my home planet, petropia.  because of my own selfishness, i was cursed to wander the universe alone the last of my kind.  but recently, i discovered a chance for redemption.  you see, neither vilgax nor i understood the true nature of the crystal.  since the beginning of time, our people's memories and dna have been encoded into the crystal's molecular lattice.   gwen: so it's a backup drive for the whole planet.   tetrax: and everyone who lived there.  yes.  once i understood the truth, i stole it from vilgax and brought it here to chromastone, who was created to be the guardian of the sacred crystal.  he will carry it back home.  and when our solar system's three stars are in a rare alignment, he will channel the crystal's limitless power to regenerate petropia and its people.   ben: you could have just told us.   tetrax: there wasn't time.  the stars are coming into alignment even as we speak.   gwen: is that shooting star part of it.   tetrax: shooting star.  that's no shooting star.  ..   ben: vilgax.   vilgax: where is my crystal.   ben: maybe i should have stayed in bed after all.  trade.  respect the pouch, respect it.    ..  in your mcdonald's happy meal.   . ba da ba ba ba .  hey ronald. wanna pogo. give me a second.  .  . ba da ba ba ba .  announcer: there is a place not so far away.  a place where you don't have to keep the volume down.

not so far away place.  come to the forest.  where the other you lives.  but first, stop bydiscovertheforest.org.   vilgax: you stole from me, tetrax.  give me what is mine, and your death will be quick.   tetrax: get behind me.   vilgax: fool.   ben: i'll handle him.   humongousaur: way big.  aw, man.  stupid omnitrix.   get ready to rumble, vilgax, 'cause humongousaur's gonna gonna  gonna  kevin: he's gonna blow.   humongousaur: ahhhhhchoo.    gwen: ugh.  gesundheit.   kevin: you aresowashing that.   vilgax:   gwen: aah. unh.   tetrax: we can't beat him like this.  fall back and regroup.   jetray: jetray.   vilgax: cowards.  there's nowhere you can hide from me.   tetrax: it's almost time.   jetray: float like a butterfly, sting like a huh.  unh.   vilgax: i'll squash you like the insignificant insect you are.   jetray: unh.  flying's no fun ifeverybodycan do it.   ben: aw, man.   gwen: ben.   ben: aah. unh.   gwen: unh.   kevin: i've got an idea.  keep him busy.        vilgax: the crystal, tetrax.  there is no escape for you.      vilgax: fools.  you're just prolonging the inevitable.     kevin: see.  told you i had a plan.  i've gotanotherone, too.   gwen: do you ever have a plan that doesn't involve crawling around in the sewers.   kevin: you're welcome.  and stop whispering.  we're half a mile away from where vilgax is looking.   ben: good point.  even with his superhearing, he can't pick us out over all the people talking in the desert.  ahahchoo.   come on.  what are the odds that he  vilgax: give me the crystal.   tetrax: will this do.   vilgax:   tetrax: unh.  i can't hold him back.   ben: betican.   echo echo: echo echo.  ahhhhhchoo.   vilgax: aah.  unh.   tetrax: you did it.   ben: was there ever any doubt.   gwen: plenty of doubt over here.   vilgax:    tetrax:   vilgax: i'll only ask once more.  .   tetrax: you'll never find it.   kevin: yeah, 'cause that chromastone dude took it halfway across the galaxy.   vilgax: really.   kevin: ow.  too much information.   tetrax: unh.    ben: nice going, motormouth.   kevin: oh, come on.  how's he gonna find him in the whole universe.   tetrax: i have to stop him.   gwen: we're going with you.   ben: i wouldn't argue with her.   kevin: there's really no point.   ben: i wonder if i should really be flying with this cold.  what if my head explodes.   kevin: don't worry.  in space, no one can hear you sneeze.   chromastone: it is done.  petropia lives again.  and soon, herpeoplewill live again, as well.  unh.  unh.   vilgax: chromastone.  i believe you have something that belongs to me.

crystal is mine.  i paid for it.  you're nothing but a common thief.   chromastone: billions of lives are at stake.   vilgax: you should be concerned with preserving your ownlife.   ben: there it is.   tetrax: petropia.  i never thought i'd see it again.   gwen: but where's chromastone.   ben: look down there.   gwen: he's in trouble. hurry.   chromastone:   vilgax: any last words.   chromastone:..save...  my people.  have mercy.   vilgax: mercy.  never heard of it.   chromastone: aah.     tetrax: no. give it back.   vilgax: you bore me, tetrax.  that fool.  using all of the crystal's power just to reassemble a dead world.  all this for nothing.   ben: i'll show you "nothing".  come back and fight.   tetrax: the crystal.   ben: it's dead.   tetrax: and chromastone.   tetrax: then all is lost.   chromastone:  no.  the stars are still aligned.  there is still time.   ..i'm too weak to continue.  ..please.   kevin: what are you supposed to do.   ben: i don't know.   diamondhead: but diamondhead does.   tetrax: he's done it.   gwen: that was incredible.  everyone on the planet is alive again.   ben: noteveryone.   yes, ben everyone.   ben:..  you're alive.   not

the end of this, are we.   gwen: not ever.   ben: thanks for the ride home, tetrax.   tetrax: it's the least i can do, ben.   gwen: we don't want to hold you up.  you must be anxious to get back to your friends.   tetrax: i am.  but first, i have a score to settle with vilgax.   ben: are you sure that's such a great idea.  i mean, he's pretty much invulnerable.   tetrax: maybe.  maybe not.
