bubble.  heavens, i don't have data for this.   edd: inhale, ed.  reverse your breathing.  hey, where you going with my gum.  is that a hot air balloon.  what's it to ya.  oh, heh heh heh.  why, of course it is, johnny, my boy.  one seat left for the trip of a lifetime.  you're so full of it, eddy.  we at ed's hot air tours will only charge you 25 cents.  hey. cough up, you freeloader.  um, ed.

a lathe.  hmm.  well, what do you know.  it's sarah's diary.  let's make some popcorn and read it.  it's sarah's, eddy.  put it back.  get away from it.  edd: i'll take that.  thank you.  ed's right, eddy.  a diary is a written record of one's private and personal thoughts.  fortunately, there will be no reading of this intimate ledger, not while i'm present.  at last, my revenge.   sarah: what the heck are you talking about, jimmy.  tai chi, sarah, the art of relaxation.  everybody's doing it.  it's sarah.  we are so doomed.  help me, guys.  she'll tell mom, and mom will tell dad, and he'll say, "not now, i just got home " hmm.  i'm not in my happy place, eddy.  where am i supposed to put this.  jimmy: you find a quiet space and stretch your muscles.  soothing.  boy, that's stupid.  sarah: come on, let's try on shoes, jimmy.  doubled, think fast.  oh, that was brilliant, eddy.  i've got it.  jimmy: it was such a cute squirrel, too.  oh, no.  ed.  wait till i get my hands on thatthatmy room's a wreck.  a rose by any other name would smell as sweet, sarah.  oh, jimmy.  this is a fullpager for my diary.   my diary.  quickly, we need to find sarah's diary, eddy, or who knows what she'll do.  i know what she'll do, and it won't be fresh linen.  well put, ed.  ok, enough looking.  but, eddythe diary.  i'm in my happy place, doubled.  i'm sure it will turn up, sarah.   where is it.  wow, sarah, can you, like, yell any louder.  take a hike, doll face.  sarah's diary is missing.  oh, man, that's horrible.  yeah, a real drag.  no problem.  kevin and i can help you find it.  oh, man.  no sign of sarah, eddy.   is there something you'd like to share with us.  uh, no.  what's your problem.  hand it over, eddy.  i have no idea what you're talking about.  ed.  just as i thought.  you ran off with sarah's diary.  it's saturated in drool, and its spine is bent.  we can't return it in this condition.  good, because i haven't started reading it yet.  ed: i'm not in my happy place, guys.  i'm really not enjoying this, eddy.  ok, i've had about enough now.  tada.  i'm losing it. i'm losing it.  bingo.  take 5, lumpy.  doubled lost it all over the ground, eddy.  ha ha. listen to this.  "dear diary, doubled is so cute.  " ha ha ha.  a horsey.  me and sarah.  sitting in a tree.  kissing.  oh, look.  and eddy drawing.  and another.  eddy: that ain't me.  edd: seems sarah would like to pursue a career in animation.  what a loser.  oh, look. eddy is a smudge.    don't worry, sarah.  see. we'll find your diary, honest.  the space beneath the rock is vacant, she who gives migraines.  i want my diary.  speaking of vacant, anybody seen dork, dork, and dorky.  wow, good thing that problem cleared up, huh, ed.  ha ha ha.  enough is enough, eddy.  my mind is riddled with unpleasant images.  i implore you, please stop reading the diary.  i knew it. you're busted.  what theway to go, bucko.  you've reached a new low in dork history.  ha. jealous.  hasta la vista, baby.  i do apologize for the abrupt accommodations, kevin.  c'est la vie.  this show needs subtitles.  we've broken the law.  not only have we taken one's personal belongings, but add to it abduction and detaining one against their will.  what to do. what to do.  i could use some help here.  i forget what we're doing.  edd: that's it.  i suggest we sneak back to the house, we bury the book within its boundaries, and deceptively plead amnesia.  i like that.  doubled, that's so underhanded.  oh, dear, you're right.  ed: i'm rubbing off on you, doubled.  happy place, happy place, happy place.  betrayed by my own vocabulary.  hello.  jimmy: wait for me, sarah.  bad mouth. bad.  tape.  the coast is clear.  let's move out.   off you go, mister.  will you move it.    oh, this will do fine.   let's bury that book.  that book's attacking.  duck.  i'm sweating.  ah.  are you all right, doubled.  well, i deserved that.  what.  sarah: hey you.  that's my diary.  aah. trouble.  run. baste a turkey.  you better not have read anything.  me. never.  you should be happy we found it for you, sarah.  there's drool stains all over these pages.  you looked at my diary.  way to go, doubled.  well, it's been nice knowing ya.  do something, ed. she's your sister.  we're goners, eddy.  give 'em the old onetwo, buckle my shoe, sarah.  isn't there anything we can do to make you feel better.  sarah.  um, can i help you.  got it.  she'll never go for the gum, eddy.  shut up and start chewing.  eddy, sarah's getting closer.  eddy: faster, doubled.  chew, chew. come on.  my jaw's cramping.  hurry, blow a bubble.  blow a bubble, doubled.  eddy: see you later, halfpint.  ed, you get back here or i'm telling mom.  don't tell mom, sarah.  i've got ed germs.  have mercy, child of the netherworld.   sarah, thinking: dear diary, my brother and that stupid eddy got what they deserved today.  doubled looked so innocent, but you know what they say, give those cute ones an inch, and they'll take a mile.  once again our day ends with
