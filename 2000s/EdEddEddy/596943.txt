nancy liked that oldsoftball jersey of yours.  as it turns out, nancy would rather have a pairof men's dirty flipflops than my softball jersey.  apparently,it wasn't feminine enough.  you think i'm feminine,don't you, hank.  well, sure you are.  you're a wife and a mother.  yeah, there's that.  i just felt so ungainly compared to those women.  why don't you call your shoe store in lubbock.  i'm

action before i commit to owning them.  it's a technique i learned from this interesting woman i met today.  her name is carolyn and she wears gloves.  gloves.  huh, that is interesting.  i felt this instant sense of camaraderie with her that i don't normally find with other women.  so you've got someone to talk to about this stuff now.  that's great.  yes, it is, hank.  taxi.  hmm, this chicken curry is delicious.  i could understand why it is one of oprah's favorite sandwiches.  peggy, you ate that whole sandwich.  yes, yes, i did.   i'm sorry. that was very unladylike.  and none of your lipstick smeared or came off at all.  how do you do that.  well, just before biting, i move the teeth forward and slide the lip up.  i'll show you in slomo.  it works.  this is going to be a lifesaver.  see, i do this song and dance act on the weekends, and i need to be able to snack between sets, so i don't pass out during the particularly emotional numbers.  thank you, peggy.  i got the idea from watchingshark attacks on the nature channel, or a bette davis moviei can't remember.  i don't know why everyone doesn't drive with their high beams on.  you see so much better.  so, the glassesare you afraid of the laser surgery, too.
