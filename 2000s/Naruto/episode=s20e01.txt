to the dreamworld just a little more. with this, i can.. with this ninja tool, i can instantly seal the enemy. but before that, i have to ask someone from the hidden cloud how to use it. wha. now.become one. i can't move my body. no. i have to. i have to save everyone. huh. any way i look at it, this is my room, right. the hidden leaf village. how. does this mean i was. transported here from the battlefield. what happened to the others. i'd better find someone. hold on. what is this feeling. i might have left the battlefield, but this is just way too peaceful. tenten. so here you are. thank goodness. so you and lee got transported here too, guy sensei. huh. like a newly appeared comet, i am rock lee, the fashion trendsetter of the hidden leaf. coolly making my entrance. nothing. that was nothing just now. what was wrong with it. a true fashion trendsetter elicits such comments from others, not himself. grownups behave in a cooler manner, lee. you're right. i shall be more careful from now.  more stylishly.  more stylishly. hold it. what are you up to at a time like this. like this. we're in the middle of a war. this is no time to be joking around. what are you talking about. if you mean the third great ninja war, it ended a long time ago. snap out of it. this is no time to be playing the fool. from my standpoint, you need to snap out of it. huh. he's right, tenten. open your eyes a little more. huh. no way. that voice. you always wear those ugly sports bras. it's time you wake up and wear some better underwear. huh. sports bras. hey. why. what's going on.. that was totally uncool, neji. you have no sense of style. this is also part of discipline. you've got to be kidding. neji's acting like a pervert. no. neji is supposed to be dead. so why are sensei and lee acting like nothing happened. what's the big commotion here. hey, you're just in time. huh. it's the usual. please scold neji too, menma. huh. menma. something wrong. aww yeah. barbecued meat is the best. hardly. even if it's dinnertime, i want something light. yeah. this is really light. that's hardly what i call light. you're always such a fool. are you eating enough, tenten. huh. oh yeah. i came just to make sure, but. still neji, your dirty mind is a problem. i was just trying to discipline her. quit makin' excuses, you disgrace to our clan. do it again and i'll rip your eyeballs out. remember that. that's a mean joke, lady hinata. oh scary. i couldn't imagine doing something like that. hey, don't take advantage of the situation and get close to menma or i'll kill you. menma doesn't welcome your kind of attention. go away. shoo. you go away. shoo. shoo. you're both pains. get away from me.  you're so cold, menma.  wwhat. don't get worked up. you have me. i don't need a cheap flirt like you. talk about a negative reaction. but that's what i like about you, my kitten. did someone say kitten. i love cats. no one's talking about cats. but what concerns me is the source of the repulsive feeling i've been getting. there it is. hey, what the hell are you doing.. we're eating. relax. this spray is harmless to the human body. and i show no mercy towards bugs, not even tiny ones. that's not the issue. thank you for the food. huh. are you leaving already. we're splitting the bill, so you should eat your fill. i'm full. this is for my share. lord kizashi haruno is the best. a toast.to lord fourth. i don't recognize that great stone face. this is no place i'm familiar with. and it's not a dream. so, i could be inside a genjutsu. then i have to break the genjutsu as soon as possible. release. release. release. release. release. i said, release. what's going on.. it's not working at all. does this mean my release skills don't have any effect... that's right, i have to rescue everyone. i can't stay locked up here. i won't let you have your way. i'm going to get out of here, madara, and seal you away. if i'm going to escape from this world, i have to learn every little detail about genjutsu. even if i can't reverse the genjutsu, there must be some other way. but, old textbooks won't help, huh. hey, tenten. are you up. oh, is it time for morning training. wait a sec. this is a fake world created by our enemy. i can't waste any time with fake people. oh, here she is. good morning, tenten. even still, close up, they really did a good job making you. what's with the weird talk all of a sudden. listen, i don't intend on getting friendly with you guys. i don't feel like training or going on missions, so please remember that. no training or missions. hey, lee. do you think tenten's still halfasleep. maybe. she left early yesterday when we were eating barbecue. it's possible she caught a cold too. i'm wide awake, and i don't have a cold. anyway, please leave. okay, the distractions are gone. now, to study all i can. what's going on with tenten anyway. ditching training and missions are taboo for a leaf shinobi. nyah, nyah. she must really hate you. that's not the problem. well, he might be onto something. i mean, your team's got some serious issues. that's true. i wouldn't be able to take all that vulgar talk. are you saying i'm the problem. no. the way i see it, her anger is directed at something more than that. you mean. i'm also to blame. leaf village library i guess i'll have to go to the library to research this. it's not a place i'm used to visiting, but. hey, tenten. you're back. didn't you hear what i said. i did hear you. and that's why we're here. let's do this, neji.  please forgive us.  please forgive us. that was a nice apology. one's sincerity is displayed by attitude. what is this. i'm not following it at all. or.could they be madara's henchmen. which means. they intend to coax and drag me into this world.. give them a break and forgive them. they're really sorry. i agree. say, tenten. you can try to approach me, but it won't work. you, and you, and you. don't come near me until hell freezes over. what. oh. now she hates you even more. until hell freezes over. now, now.don't get so depressed. but i wonder what the cause of all this is. maybe she's not mad, but worried about something. worried huh. she doesn't have an appetite, she rejects her friends. she's troubled and wants to be left alone. there's no mistake. she's lovesick. that's all you think about. what do you think, menma. we'll get nowhere just talking amongst ourselves. you're right. so let's all do something for her.  all right.  yes. nothing here. this either. not this.or this.or this. i thought i'd find something by coming here. but there aren't any helpful books at all. i'm no good at researching things to begin with. i prefer to have someone else do the thinking for me. i wonder what's happening with everyone in the real world. i can't be wasting time like this. a rose. that's a face longing for love, my kitten. what's the big idea.. sorry about this. i keep telling you to stay out of my way. are you leaving already. well, you're bothering me. don't be so rude. we're all just worried about you. you can cut the act, you fakes. tenten.. you can try to get in my way, but i'm not giving up. i'm going home to my own world. she's got it really bad. thanks to your stupid idea. oh boy. she's beyond our help. she's in full battlemode and she's just not listening to us. so you didn't fare any better, eh. if she's not upset about neji's pervy comments and she's not in love. what do we do. we just have to leave her alone. oh, but that doesn't mean ignore her. i agree. tenten herself seems to want that. isn't that.a little cold. i don't think we should leave her alone. something bothers me. menma, you're such a good, thoughtful friend. the complete opposite of that tenten. i'll go beat some sense into that wench. one moment, lady hinata. she disappeared. she left a clone. the real one is already gone. that hinata. this only gives me a bad feeling. i'll track her scent. follow me. a whole day and still no leads. will i be able to go home. am i stuck here forever. what is this. what an ugly weapon. don't just take it. give it back. no way. if you want it back, apologize for today. everyone's worried about you, and all you do is insult us and make accusations. tell us plain and clear. just what's going on. here she is. hinata, you're being too rough. shut up. we'll get nowhere otherwise. fine, i'll take it back by force. hey. hinata. stand down, tenten. what's going on. that was. hey, wait. damn it. that's was something you just don't aim at friends. what's going on. you deserved it. you aren't my friends. i didn't ask you to worry about me. i have my own goals. and i don't want you to get in my way. this isn't where i belong. i don't care about this village or you. you're lying. i mean. that's not the kind of person you are. think what you want. what's with her anyway. this is more than weird. it's like she's a totally different person. she makes me so mad. they're fighting. isn't it terrible. kids these days. i see. what i want to know is how to escape. but when the usual methods don't work and you can't rely on your friends. sounds tough. maybe if you were a leader instead of a follower, you could do it. i figured. next time on naruto shippuden: "where tenten belongs. " aww, jeez. i can't think of any other way. where tenten belongs tune in again. )
