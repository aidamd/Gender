wha.. wha.. what is this.. how terrible. who did this.. naruto uzumaki, at your service. i'm going to become the hokage, no matter what. hey. come back. you won't get away with this. damn it. it was him again. he's made a big mess. even if we want to file a complaint, he doesn't have any parents we can complain to. what'll we do. who's going to pay for all this. who do we complain to. was it him again. yes, the boy whose name is taboo. what a nuisance.  he's so unpleasant.  i'll say. he's such a pain. i'm leaving. you forgot something. oops. what did you make us for lunch. did you put in omelets. yes, i put in lots.  yes.  yes. be careful now.  okay.  okay. can i come in. this is for this month's living expenses. spend it wisely now. hey. hmm. why don't i have a mom and dad. didn't i tell you before. although it was quite some time ago. that's not what i want to hear. you're talking about when that beast called the nine tailed fox spirit ran amuck, right. and that a lot of people in the village were killed, including my mom and dad. well, that's not what i'm asking about. i just want to know. who were my parents. what kind of people were they. there's no use asking about that. it won't bring the dead back. meeting now then, for the next lesson. instead of just introducing yourselves, i want you to demonstrate your ninjutsu skills. so, we'll try a basic jutsu. the clone jutsu. first up is sasuke uchiha. try it out. uchiha. as in the uchiha clan. yes, he's an elite among the elites. you always act so smug and i can't stand it. brag, after you prove it. i intend to. when did you.. well done. with this jutsu, if you attack the real one. it's useless.  what an idiot.  so pitiful. damn it. i'm gonna pulverize him today for sure. ya know. damn it. damn it. damn it. damn it. damn it. damn it. damn it. oh man. oh man. even choji.. damn it. definitely today. definitely today. definitely today. next, naruto uzumaki. and. sasuke uchiha. sasuke. do your best, sasuke. you're totally going to win. damn it. why does he always get the attention. i'm not going to lose. start. amazing. he's so cool. sasuke, you're terrific. this guy. that look in his eyes. it's the same look that everyone gives me. no. it's stronger than that. but. but it's not for me. he pisses me off. hey. not him again. you rascal. damn it, where did he go.. over there. serves you right. i acted like the older brother you desired. in order to measure your vessel. did you hear. everyone in the uchiha clan was killed. yeah, i know. i heard my dad talking about it. he's the only one who survived. starting from today, i get to wear this. perfect. all right, i'm a genin from today. let's see, we'll start with the introductions. i'll go. i'll go. i'm naruto uzumaki. i love instant ramen. but i love the ramen at ichiraku that iruka sensei treats me to even more. and i hate having to wait three minutes after pouring in the hot water. my future dream is. to surpass the hokage. and that's why i'm going to make everyone in the village acknowledge me. any hobbies. playing pranks. next. my name is sasuke uchiha. there are lots of things i hate. and not many things i like. also, i have no intention of saying i have a dream, but i do have an ambition. that is to. kill a certain man one day. that's it for the introductions. we start our mission tomorrow. what kind of mission. there is something just the four of us are going to do. what. what. a survival exercise. i'll be your opponent, but it won't just be an exercise. this is an extremely difficult test that has a 66% failure rate. sasuke, let's walk home together. no thanks. i'm finally a genin and i have no intention on getting dropped. i'm going to train alone. i guess you're right. putting on airs. all right. if sasuke's going to train, so will i. i'm not going to lose to him. here i come, kakashi sensei. i'm going to be a genin, no matter what. damn it. of all people, i had to get stuck with sakura and that loser in the threeman cell. i can pass, even by myself. i have a goal. okay, the clock's been set to 12 o'clock. there are two bells here. your task is to take these bells away from me by noon. the one who fails to take a bell gets no lunch. and failing the exercise means failing the mission. in other words, at the very least, one of you will be returning to the academy. ready. start. i'm just going to go for it, like i always do. that loser. makeout paradise i'm gonna pulverize him. damn it. this.this wasn't supposed to. fire style: fireball jutsu. why should i steal a stupid bell. i can hide and eat right now. thank you for the food. hey. i was just joking. too late. if you three had worked together, you might have gotten the bell. this exercise was devised to break up the team and see what you would do. well, guys, i'm going to give you one more chance. however, the afternoon scramble for the bells will be much more difficult. if you accept the challenge, eat your lunch. however, don't let naruto eat. huh. that's your punishment for breaking the rule and attempting to eat lunch alone. if you give naruto any food, you will be immediately disqualified. i am the law here. understand. like i care if i don't get to eat. i don't need any food. to steal a bell from kakashi. as much as i hate to admit it, i can't do it alone. what should i do.. combine the strength of three into one. here. hhey sasuke. didn't you hear what sensei said.. it's all right. he's not around. the three of us will go and get the bell this afternoon. it will be trouble if he hinders me, so. sakura. thank you. you pass. in the ninja world, those who break the rules are scum. but those who abandon their friends, are worse than scum. that ends the survival exercise. you all pass. okay, picture time. look sharp. why do i have to be in the same picture as this guy.. that's what i'd like to know, you loser. say that again. come on, guys. this is a tradition. team 7 will start its mission tomorrow. what.. the first one. kakashi sensei. the second one. aamazing. kakashi sensei was using a substitution. ii couldn't do a thing. yet he. it's our first real combat situation. yet wasn't he scared at all. he looked like nothing was happening, and didn't even get his clothes dirty. and he saved me. hey. are you hurt, scaredy cat. why're we so different. how come i'm always the one.. damn it. i'll never let myself get into a situation where i need to be rescued. and i won't get scared or run away. i swear it on the pain of this left hand. if you don't want to owe me anything, you should just get stronger than me, you loser. damn it. i'll catch up to you and surpass you in strength. next on naruto shippuden: "rivals" rivals when did he get this strong. rivals tune in again. )
