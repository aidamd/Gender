the forgotten island we'll be repairing the ship. thank you. is bushy brow sensei really here. the bird flew off in this direction. i think it's safe to conclude that its nest is around here. but.is there a chance that bushy brow sensei has been eaten. no matter how seasick and weak he is, he wouldn't let a bird eat him. well, i'll use sage mode and see if i can find him. hold it, naruto. we don't know what kind of island this is. let's keep our secret weapons in reserve. look, over there. there's a native islander. i'll go talk to her. are we gonna wait until he returns. no. let's search in another direction. wait. i'm not anyone suspicious. wait. rasengan. that's a humongous spider. it's coming. right. shadow clone jutsu.  it's huge.  it's huge. wood style. i've battled a giant serpent like this before. yeah. it's just like orochimaru's summons. that bird. it's the one that took guy. stop. hey you, can i ask you something. have you seen my friend. we're looking for our friend who got separated from us. i'd like to ask you some questions. and ask about you as well. what is this. "investigation into summoning: improvements as well as creation. " creation. "this is a summoning island. " "many life forms reside here that are useful to shinobi for summoning. " "at first, research was our only purpose. " "but to satisfy requests from shinobi for summoning animals," "we set out to capture them. " "in the midst of increasing demand," "it was decided to begin improving the summoning animals. " "through crossbreeding," "new species of summoning animals will also be created. " "the demand from shinobi is increasing. " "is there an ultimate summoning animal." "if not, we will just have to create one. " "the problem is how to suppress the ultimate animal. " "to control it, a special sealing jutsu is necessary. " "or perhaps something else that is unique like a jinchuriki. " "it would be perfect if a survivor of that village could be found. " jinchuriki. what is this island. hey. ready. let's go. yes, that's right. raise your legs higher.  what.  what. bushy brow sensei. you guys. hey, stop that, you guys. i know. i know. what's going on. well, it seems. hey. stop, stop. i've been brought here to babysit them. what. that's ridiculous. i'm not in any danger of being eaten. i'm just here playing with these chicks. by the way, where are we. well, we have no idea either. we came chasing after you, bushy brow sensei. say, why did you bring me here. if you want a babysitter, find someone else. i'm in the midst of a mission. i must go. what. you want me to get on. yes. all right. guy. we won't learn anything by staying here. you two come along. you. this is. hey, is this the ultimate summoning animal. then i'll ask it directly. whoa, what are they.. does it plan to land there. shoo, shoo. inside here. this is a volcano. a volcano. what the heck is that voice. wood style. let's go and see. right. we're going.. hey, stay away. ignore them. they're not showing signs that they want to attack us. no way it was eating them. the other animals. the summoning animals of this island. it's not working. we can't control it. honoka. the seal. hurry and seal it. honoka. do something to make it stop. i can't. i can't suppress it. help. someone, help me. this thing ate everything in sight, and then went to sleep. now it's a chrysalis waiting to mature. then that means you're. aoba. guy. you're alive. never mind that. what is this place. it seems to be a research facility to create ultimate summoning animals. and the result of the research. what is this. i'm not sure where these shinobi were from, but they were conducting research on summoning animals. and it seems they've created the ultimate summoning animal that feeds on other animals and assimilates their abilities into its own. what. this thing is alive. probably. furthermore, it swallowed up the researchers and is trying to further evolve. ththose guys. is it about to be born. so this is the ultimate summoning animal. well, it just looks like a giant greedy monster to me. what will we do. anyone want to try entering into a contract with it. it's in no mood for that. it's coming. spider thread. it assimilated the abilities of that spider it devoured earlier. it's hungry. it's starving. no matter how much it eats, it still feels hungry. all it knows is a desire to eat everything in sight. in other words, it's a failure of a summoning animal. however, it was created specifically for use against shinobi. don't let your guard down. wood style. right on, captain yamato. it sucked out my chakra. so that's what "created specifically for use against shinobi" means. i'll pulverize it with my sage mode. naruto's sage mode requires time to absorb nature energy. let's cover him. eight inner gates. fifth gate. open. it's using genjutsu. hang in there, guy. that was an embarrassing defeat. naruto. it's genjutsu. i can't believe that thing can use genjutsu. lightning style.. it uses ninjutsu too. we don't know what other abilities it has up its sleeve. lava. there.by the back entrance. i see. if we can drop that thing into the lava, it's over. wood style: domed wall. naruto, go into sage mode. all right, here i go. severe leaf hurricanes. how was that.. wings.. i won't let you escape. is it trying to run away.. if we let something like that loose. what's going on. are they trying to avenge the others who were eaten. watch out. get back. i knew it, so you really are. aoba. why won't you stop her. because that is just an embodiment of her thoughts that were left behind. naruto. now. wind style: rasen shuriken. thank you. to think that i could fall asleep while training. it just shows that i lack vigilance. i have to become strong like naruto. no. i have to become stronger than naruto. but if i could be strong like how i was in that dream guy sensei. it might time to undergo that training. next time on naruto shippuden: "fight. rock lee." tune in again. )
