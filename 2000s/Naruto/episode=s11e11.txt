it's been so long since we've stood on dry land. we're here. did we finally make it to the new continent. new continent. are you saying we've arrived at the land of lightning. no, we're just making a stop at this fishing port to stock up on supplies. our ocean voyage has just begun. so this means i have to endure more time on the high sea and try to come out of it alive.. after we leave this port, we won't be able to dock for quite some time. is that so. for about two weeks, since we'll be entering the sea route of silence. the sea route of silence. yes. the sea route of silence is an unusual area in the vast ocean. in it, there's no wind or fish. it is surrounded by a mysterious magnetic field. even steamships can't function there. then how will the boat move forward. there's just one strip, as narrow as a canal, where a small current flows. we'll have the boat ride that current. once we're on that current, we won't be able to speed up or turn around. so it will be like riding along leisurely on the back of a horse you can't control. that's true. but there are merits to it as well. every ship that enters this route will face the same situation. so we won't have to worry about being attacked by pirates or an enemy. i see. in any case, we need to stock up on two weeks of supplies. we can't afford to run out while we're on this course. so please gather food. naruto, can i ask you get guy sensei's share too. why are you all spinning around. man, do i have to. okay. that's everything. now, i just need to get back to the ship and we can set sail. what's the matter. hey. are you okay. i'm sorry about that. i'm all right. you're a hidden leaf ninja, aren't you. huh. well.yeah. is it true that the five great nations have formed an alliance and are going to start a war. are those rumors going around. yes. small lands like ours have no choice but to abide by their orders. but seeing that you've stopped at this fishing port and purchased provisions, i suppose you're going through the sea route of silence to get to the land of lightning, am i correct. yeah, that's about right. i can't tell you much more than that. i wish i could buy vegetables from you to make amends, but i've already gotten everything we need. then. how about getting one of these. what is it. it's a mushroom known as a moldshroom. moldshroom. they're really delicious. and they're very easy to propagate, so in case of emergencies, you can grow them and eat them, and you won't have to worry about food shortages. seafarers who set out on the sea route of silence always buy one to keep as a last resort. that's a beneficial mushroom to have. all right. i'll buy one. see you. thank you. eat or die. mushrooms from hell. i don't want to go. i'm not getting back on board. this is the hidden cloud village. you guys are wrong. please, guy. you're not a spoiled brat.  you're hopeless.  don't wanna. guy. hey naruto, why on earth did you just. i don't have the patience to put up with bushy brow sensei's "cute spoiled brat" act. that's for sure, but. let's set sail. guy, let's get going.  here you go.  got it. have a safe trip. it looks like we've entered the sea route of silence. we can't see anything around us. and this intense humidity. just thinking about sailing through this for two weeks makes me depressed. however, this is the safest place on the ocean. naruto, you should use this time to rest. i know. what's the matter, captain yamato. no, it's nothing. yamato. yamato. get a hold of yourself. he suddenly collapsed in pain. all we can do at this point is have him rest. did something happen. bushy brow sensei. what happened to your seasickness. the swaying subsided once we entered the sea route of silence, and so did my seasickness. i see. just when you start feeling better, it's captain yamato's turn. what happened to yamato. we don't know for certain. it seems something is eroding yamato's chakra. yamato's chakra. we still don't know what's causing his symptoms. so does that mean. bad news. what is it.. please come with me. what are these.. mushrooms.. did some spores get mixed in with our provisions. i bought a mushroom called a moldshroom. but only one. and it didn't have a poisonouslooking color like these. the ship's entire food supply is right here. does that mean all of our food supply is destroyed. does this mean the only thing we can eat are these mushrooms. check out their coloring. they look like poisonous mushrooms to me. it's not just the food. our water is gone too. no way. we can't go on without food or water. we have to turn this ship around. we can't. once we're on the sea route of silence, turning back is impossible. but we just got on the route. so we have two weeks until we can get off of this course. it means we are just going to have to endure without eating or drinking. are you kidding me.. still. there's gotta be at least one fish. or at least one bird. there's nothing. once before, during the peak of my passionate days of youth, i trained by fasting. a human burns without nutrients, the human body converts its own muscle into protein and turns fat into energy. as long as this continues, you will not starve to death. starve to death. i hope not. but that's as long as you stay sufficiently hydrated. right now, we're in the opposite situation. at this rate, even the most determined adult will die in one to two weeks. what day is this.. i don't know. a week might have passed already. i've been hungry so long, my stomach can't tell the time anymore. if this goes on, we're definitely going to starve to death. perhaps it's time for our last gamble. our last gamble. follow me, naruto. no way. this is your last gamble. yes, this is it. if these are edible. they sure look poisonous to me. but these mushrooms could be absolutely delicious. and if we don't eat anything, we will die. i know, but. naruto, let's do rockpaperscissors right now. all right. i'm ready for this. here we go, naruto. ready, set, go. ready, set, go. rockpaperscissors. rockpaperscissors. all right. i win. i win. i should've known you'd go with paper. that doesn't sound too flattering. sensei, now's the time to be a man and step up. bushy brow sensei. wwhat's going on. have you lost it. no, naruto. i'm relishing this moment. huh. i've been waiting for this moment. thank you for the food. bushy brow sensei, are you okay. so the mushrooms were poisonous, after all. these are delicious. i've never eaten anything so good. how could i not have eaten them until now.. bushy brow sensei, are you sure they taste good. i'm going to eat them. i'll eat them all up. wait. hey wait. me too. i'm gonna eat too. hey, you're right. they taste great. i can't stop. i'm starting to feel really good. me too. i feel energy rising from deep inside my body. there are some more mushrooms over there. those mushrooms are all mine. take this. mushroom hurricane. i know what your weakness is, bushy brow sensei. ninja art. mushroom harem jutsu. bushy brow sensei. so handsome. let's have some fun. so nave. you think something like that will make me get a nosebleed.. great mushroom hurricane. you're mine. mushroom rasengan. too easy, naruto. not bad. shadow clones, huh. the real one's over here. mushroom rasengan. severe mushroom hurricane. how did this happen. i should have never bought that mushroom. damn it. who cares now. i need to put food in my mouth. in my mouth. that's it. ninja art: mushroom summoning jutsu. hey naruto, what do you want. what's this. you look so yummy. i'm gonna eat you. it looks like they're all dead. they intended to go to the land of lightning. they must have some kind of treasure on board. i admire your cleverness, boss. yeah, he's a pirate that operates with a single mushroom. the moldshroom is just an ordinary mushroom. but if you keep it in a dark, humid place for more than a day, it turns into a very toxic mushroom that propagates rapidly. it wreaks havoc on the sea route of silence. and they probably had no clue what hit them. all right, guys. go and find the treasure.  right.  right. so it was all your doing. hey, how come you guys are. you guys were supposed to have starved to death. i almost gave in. i was so hungry that i was about to eat everything in sight. wait, wait, wait, gamatatsu. eat up. naruto, it tastes good. eat. stupid. i'm gonna eat you and you're. i know. i have a good idea. at this point, i'll endure anything. i asked gamatatsu to bring back some of granny shima's cooking. so you had a trick up your sleeve.. thanks to her, we ate enough bug cuisine to last a lifetime. just thinking about how that tasted. we're gonna give it back to you. real good. the waves are back to normal. but look at this mess. what happened here. do you know naruto. my memory's been fuzzy ever since i ate those mushrooms. but, this is a real mess. it looks like pirates raided us. yeah, this is awful. yamato's going to be very upset. maybe something awful happened before we realized it. i suddenly feel seasick. not again, bushy brow sensei. are you awake, yamato.. what happened to me. you became host to a kind of parasitic fungus that sucked out your wood style chakra. you'll be all right now. i can't believe there's a mushroom that can cause so much suffering. just goes to show you how vast this world is. what are you going to do with us. apparently, the sea route of silence has a way back. you're not planning to send us there. exactly. the route takes two weeks to clear. what about food during that time.. you don't have to worry about that. this is. you guys can fill your bellies with that mushroom. see ya. wood style. hhey wait. sstop. please stop this. help us. a mushroom hot pot.. it can't be helped. all of our provisions are gone. until we reach the nearest port, all we have are. mushrooms or bugs. c'mon. give me a break from both of those things.  these mushrooms are quite good.  naruto, this one is better, try it.  hurry and just eat.  no way. i just want something normal to eat. what are they doing. seems like naruto and his clones are fighting. that's good. men fighting, colliding as their hot blood circulates. i like this. doesn't seem like that's the case here. we're taking control of this ship. if you value the life of the real naruto, you will unconditionally fulfill all of our demands. next time on naruto shippuden: "revenge of the shadow clones" it's one hassle after another. tune in again. )
