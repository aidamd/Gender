the fallen castle that was a great competition. the fallen castle let's compete against each other again sometime. see you around. you totally forgot the plan, didn't you. you almost ended up winning. it's not funny. he's in there. yup. if everything went as planned. you're one to talk. my my. you've traveled so far.  okay, we're good.  right. can i come out. we're safe now. where are we. an inn in town. is this a place where travelers can stay. it's small compared to the castle. but it's only for one night. so please bear with it. we're leaving tomorrow. it's dangerous to travel at night, so we'll set out at daybreak. i see. can i see what it's like in town. huh. well. i've never been out in town like this. but you lived in that castle. i wasn't free to roam in the castle either. there's no way i could go to town. i mean, i was a hostage. say. can i go sightseeing around town before we leave. sightseeing. that's not a good idea. i lived here, but i know nothing about it. this is the last chance i'll get, so i'd like to see it. please. where am i.. oh no. lord shu, it's almost time for breakfast. oh. hold on. i mean, i'll be right there. are you awake. we'll leave right after you're done with breakfast. you'll be fine like that. just as this land is unfamiliar to you. the local residents wouldn't think a young lord would stay in a place like this. well, as long as my comrade does his job right at the castle. lord shu, you have quite an appetite this morning, don't you. huh.. maybe yesterday's competition rubbed off on me. dried sardines. and this. tofu. hmm. i've never eaten these before. please stop looking and eat quickly. we can only stay until around noon. first, i want to go to amaama an. oh, i feel like i'm back at the competition. why're you so excited. since when did this become a foodie tour. let's go. this is such a puny nation. it's sorta a letdown. say, my man. how about we settle things here with my art. that's okay, isn't it. fine. better drum it into naruto's head not to mess things up. what a drag. things didn't go as planned. don't look so happy when you say that. amaama an oh, here. found it. ordering. lady. one large order of bean jam cakes.  what are we doing here anyway..  this time, i'll show no mercy.  sorry. how about a bean jam cake.  bring it on. here you go. a piece of bean jam cake, lord shu. this next sentence expresses the importance of time spent on literary skills. "when sleep is about to overtake you when reading, " "pierce a pick into your thigh,"  oww. that hurts, ya know.  "and blood shall flow from your leg. " "when sleep is about to overtake you when reading," "pierce a pick into your thigh," "and blood shall flow from your leg. " "ya know". this is next. gito gito tei i wanted to eat their ramen one more time. that gito gito is habitforming. sheesh. how come you're tagging along. c'mon, shikamaru. it's good camouflage with them around, right. how's that for my planning. you just like to say the word "plan. " time to eat. i wonder if they have a lowcalorie menu. delicious. isn't it, though. after we eat this, let's go to kemu kemuen for barbecue. but first, let's savor the taste of this ramen. this soup is rich, but not heavy.  that's why you never get tired of it.  i need to go to the restroom. chef. i'll have seconds. hey, young lord. if you're planning to sneak back to the castle by yourself, forget it. i don't know what you plan to do when you get back, but. what. maybe he wants to see the princess. princess. you mean, princess chiyo.  hey, pops, we want seconds.  hey, pops, we want seconds. choji. forget the plan. just do something about those two. uhhuh. how does one train for swordsmanship. now, lord shu. come at me anytime. why you.. i forgot myself and dodged. tatewaki. who are you. wwhat are you saying, tatewaki. where is the real lord shu. i'm shu, ya know. hey, calm down, ya know. you are an imposter. you may appear to be lord shu, but you cannot fool us. that sudden plan to pretend to be the young lord was.. where is the real lord shu.. tell the truth. princess. do not kill him. i know that. but perhaps i can take an arm and a leg or two. it's not looking good right now. see ya. men. we have an intruder. intruder. after him. do not let him get away. to your stations. stat.  they found me already.  take him alive. however. that's just what i want. you can't get me. nani nani boo boo. clone jutsu. a substitute. the real imposter is still hiding somewhere. find him.  right.  right. they're heading for the main gate. which means, this way. the intruder is by the main gate. let's go. right. a huge success. and now. what're you doing loitering around here. the intruder is at the main gate. i fell earlier and my butt hurt. silence, intruder. where is lord shu..  there's no winner yet.  miso ramen with roast pork.  the plan's changed.  don't be shy, lord shu. come out. lord shu. he hasn't said a thing for a while. huh. that brat. the young lord is fine. he's way safer than being a hostage here. i don't believe you. i'm here to buy them time to get away. you let lord shu escape. tatewaki. how come you're here, old man. your clones were a little too convincing. they practically announced that you were going in the opposite direction. anyway, what you just said. even if lord shu has been taken out of the castle. he hasn't gone too far yet. nah. by now, they've arrived in his country. that's a lie. then why are you still here. you could've snuck out last night. lord shu's country is his birthplace. so his nation knows about this. lord shu is going home. i see. that is a good thing. huh. an alliance that relies on hostage taking is very fragile. and it will leave lasting scars on lord shu's heart. old man. weren't you hired by this nation. a samurai's loyalty is to peace. peace negotiated between his nation and this one is ideal. then, you're gonna let the young lord escape. but you're the problem. for the sake of peace, those who hired you must never come to light. hhey, i know that. if he is caught, i shall kill you myself. yikes. remember that well. yyou can count on me. lord shu. what is happening. you must take shelter inside the castle. young lord. lord shu. that's the prologue. now for the main feature. deidara, your part is done. huh.. i'll do the rest. no fair, my man. you said you'd let me. our aim is not to destroy a castle, but to take it over. all we need to do is to get rid of the feudal lord and those close to him. by now, they're all inside the castle. your explosives have terrified them. well, that's true. now, take me to the castle. then you can simply enjoy the view. why. how come i get it so easy, my man. i will pray for your success. huh. you had nothing to do with those explosions. yeah, definitely not. then take advantage of the chaos and get out of the castle. what about you, old man. i will accompany the princess and protect her. all right. please take care. of lord shu. i'm going to find naruto. choji and ino, get the lord out of here. got it. i hope naruto's okay.  princess chiyo.  think about yourself first. oh. lord shu. who the hell are these guys.. puppets. who sent them. damn it. rasengan. what's going on.. hey, what are you doing here.. where's princess chiyo.. please find her. save the princess. all right. so don't go off on your own. you guys.  sorry.  sorry. the feudal lord is in the castle with the chief retainer and others. okay, it's all right now. what'll you do, old man. i have a favor to ask. will you take the princess out of the castle. huh. what about you. i'm going back to the castle to rescue the feudal lord. tatewaki. i swear i will protect your father. you must wait with lord shu. i will come for you without fail. are you gonna be okay by yourself. you're the one i'm worried about. can you really protect the princess. come on. i'm worried about you. by the way, i don't even know your name. how shall i address you. naruto. naruto uzumaki. naruto, eh. i shall not forget. well then, naruto, i'm counting on you. you got it. don't die.old man. do not get in my way. anyone. is anyone here.. my lord. it is i, tatewaki. you destroyed quite a few of my puppets. who are you. i'll just say, the akatsuki. why do you attack this castle. no need to know. i'm done here. then i cannot let you leave like this. you shall take full responsibility. you deserve praise, but your master is already gone. my debt to him is neverending. i won't waste time on small fries. you know, i've been working real hard. then stay there and be quiet. that's what you call dodging well. the pipe is just for show. the needles inside are the real deal. well. the toxin on the needles should be taking effect. soon you won't be able to move. you're done for. well then, one last stand. princess chiyo. lord shu. naruto. huh. how come princess chiyo is with you. old man tatewaki asked me. huh. tatewaki. yeah. he's a superstrong samurai. there was unwelcome interference. but it seems the mission will end well. that nation fell to a larger one, huh. this means there will be more groups out there who will use the akatsuki. and what about naruto and the others. i stayed by them until they passed the territorial borders. i escorted them both to his country. they welcomed the princess too. they've been moving around with the other feudal lords. it seems they're okay. i see. that's what i wanted to know. now. capture him at once. hold it. if i could, i wish i could see them all grown up. if they saw you like this, they'd be sad. you're right. well, now i have no regrets. he took things into his own hands. yeah. in the end, it was as he wished. just like a samurai. i'm gonna live for my convictions too. that's a promise, old man. in our
