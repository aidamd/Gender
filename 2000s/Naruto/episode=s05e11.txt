oh, senpai. over there there's a dango shop. let's take a break. we've been walking all day. i'm exhausted. you don't look exhausted at all. why are you so easygoing. but senpai, we're trying to catch a tailed beast, yet we don't even know where it is. so let's just take it easy. by the way, what are we going to catch again. threetails. threetails. onetail, twotails and i'm tobi. duh. here's dango for you. wow. it looks yummy. let's see munch time. man, it's so good. this sauce is really good. it's not too sweet, nor too salty. it's a masterpiece. ahh it was great. oh, senpai, senpai. look at that. huh. that looks exactly like your work, doesn't it. could it be that your work is a ripoff. you. i'm going to kill you. the rampaging tailed beast ththis is the threetails is about to appear. what's this feeling. what's the matter, shino. my insectsfeel a weird chakra. weird chakra. they've never felt so much chakra before. it looks like akamaru feels the same thing as your insects. then it must be there. this feeling it's like highly charged air and a frantic feeling this isn't from the guys from the hidden leaf. what's happening. right there.. what the heck is that. a fog. it looks like the bats are flying toward the fog. no question about it. a huge amount of chakra is coming from over there. is it inside that fog. yes, but we can't identify it. let's dive in and find out. hey, slow down. let's get ready first. heh. that's what i wanted to hear. everyone, prepare for action. but don't rush. understood. they're increasing in number. did they call for reinforcements. i think they can easily see us. it doesn't matter. let's drop in. we're at a disadvantage numberwise. let's buy some time until guren gets here. kihou, lay a smoke screen. understood. kakashi senpai. a smoke screen they're lying in wait for us. but if we stay here too long, we won't be able to find out what's happening at the lake. we should split into two groups naruto, you go by yourself. what.. i'm not attacking. our main mission is to research the lake. oh, that's right we'll create a diversion and you head off to the center of the lake. but don't attack. yes, understood. are you sure. only naruto. let's show him a bit of trust. no one is a better survivor than naruto. good luck, naruto. you're definitely the number one unpredictable ninja in the hidden leaf. no reaction it looks like nobody's here. let's go. damn it. i can't see anything. did they escape already. they must be buying time. keep your guard up. all right, i think from here i'm going to head into the lake. i went in too deep snack for me. hey, right after we got home, you called us over here. you're such a toad driver. come on, i'll give you something in return. but, this intense chakra i wonder what's behind the fog. this is the threetails it's more than we expected what is this. this intimidation. we did it it was a success. yuukimaru is controlling the threetails. yuukimaru. damn. if he keeps using his power. if he fails, what will happen to the threetails. your job is to stop that from happening. even yuukimaru's power can't control the threetails. yuukimaru. what's that sound.. guren. stop this beast immediately. stop being so bossy. this beast. although he's huge, he's quick. right now. hurry. crystal style. divine pathway jutsu. there. my crystal shattered.. giant. crystal hexagonal shuriken. this is so hard. muddy turtle. guren. what are you doing. are you trying to kill the threetails.. contain him. or we'll all die. largescale jutsu need preparation. it's too late. gozu. hurry crystal style. crystal wall, 8th formation. eat this, turtle bastard. she did it. crystal style i never knew guren had this much ability i used a bit too muchchakra hey shino, don't get too close to me. i wouldn't get too close to you. then why did your shoulder brush against me.. because our circle is getting small. keep your mouth shut. focus on finding the enemy. but, kakashi sensei. above us. watch out. our ambush failed. kakashi sensei. thanks sakura, sai. hinata, are you better already. yeah. but still, how did she. i see, her byakugan we'd better be careful with that little girl's jutsu. even if we were in a smoke screen, she would find us damn it. what kind of place is this.. there's not one wave, and no sign of fish. it's really weird i see something. oh. it's a turtle. there's a turtle inside. brother. what kind of turtle is this. nanaruto, ththis is a tailed beast. yeah. it's the threetails. threetails. even that huge jutsu couldn't stop it.. guren. take yuukimaru and run. gozu. you, too. gozu, protect yuukimaru. all right. guren. you fight with me. she's. why is she fighting with the threetails.. guren. what are you doing here.. don't tell me where there's someone thinking of me, that's where i go home to. his place to return is with them.. don't underestimate me muddy turtle. guren. this camellia will never wither. as long as i'm alive. guren gozu. what are you doing.. take yuukimaru and get out of here. guren i figured out where to return home to. you what.. the threetails has stopped moving. it can't be. hecan control the threetails.. what.. that's. what.. that's the dimension where the threetails appeared. if we're swallowed by it. are you all right. so warm here. you this is. yuukimaru. all my chakra is going to this jutsu. this time, i'll hold your hand i heard that the threetails disappeared after the last great war. orochimaru has gotten involved with something troubling. perhaps the fact that we discovered it first is a blessing in disguise. yes we cannot hand it over to anyone. we'll capture it then. i don't think it will be easy i'm going to look it up in our existing documents. i want you to summon these members. next time: "inside the mist" huh. i didn't know sai is one year older than us, huh. that makes him the same as bushy brow, eh. wow. you mean captain yamato looks like that, and he's only 26.. huh.. with those old looks. his hobby is "reading books on architecture. " ugh. how gloomy huh. the captain and iruka sensei are the same age. you're right oh my, says here his hobby is "medicinal hot spas. " he's like a totally old dude. by the way, did you know, sakura. shizune's 31. huh. that's older than i thought right. right. which means that "ahii." reaction has to be forced, right. shshizune. i want to hear that again ahii. )
