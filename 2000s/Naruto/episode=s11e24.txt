this is serious. is something wrong. how much longer before we reach the island. there's been no wind, so. but we'll be okay. we're supposed to rendezvous with the tsuchikage's messenger by. that's going to be too late. what. chojuro. i'm going on ahead. please follow as soon as you can. i give up. the ground is still shaky. you were seasick until the very end, weren't you, guy. the end. after we replenish supplies here, we will head straight to the land of lightning. i see. a lot of things happened, but it looks like we'll accomplish our mission. by the way, where's naruto. miso and pork broth is good, but seafood broth's great too. damn it. he dashes out before you can stop him. we'll be staying here for a night. and it's a small island. there's no harm in that. whoa. it's still shaky. guy. from here on out, it's the land of water, huh. still, what a tiny island. hey, we should stop moving around so much or the people we're supposed to meet won't be able to find us. so what. we arrived early, didn't we.  we should look around while we can.  guy. are you all right.  it's taking a while to get over it, isn't it.  i can't do that. lord tsuchikage appointed me as his messenger. you just decided to come along all on your own. don't quibble, akatsuchi. the land of water hasn't had diplomatic ties with anyone. so we've never had a chance to gather intel. we may have teamed up now, but we're still shinobi. who knows when the situation will change. are you the messengers from the tsuchikage. who are you. i'll be taking. your lives. follow me. hey, do you know that we belong. to the allied shinobi force.. shut up and die, stone ninja. who are you.. that's. akatsuchi. hey. why are the stone and mist fighting here. that's what i want to ask. they just attacked us out of the blue. move it, leaf. you know i can't do that. you're in the way. what. even if you are from the leaf, if you interfere. please stop. is that backup. don't stop me, chojuro. no. this violates lady mizukage's will. per her orders. i'll have to make you stop. that's if i can. what. he disappeared. iis everyone all right. what.. how can we be all right. so scary. why would you guys attack us. huh. hey. this is no time to be arguing. this isn't good. hey, let's take him. hey, leaf underling. help us. me. an underling. naruto's vow wwhat.. what do you mean, "there's no doctor". i'm very sorry, this is an isolated island. but there's a medical ninja in my team that's headed this way. they will be arriving shortly. hey, i brought some towels. i don't need a report. just wipe his sweat. you're not very thoughtful are you, underling. who're you calling "underling".. who else but a lowly messenger genin would be hanging around a place like this. hurry up and get to work. why me. damn it. why'd it turn out like this. who are they anyway. i just received a message from lady mizukage. several shinobi have suddenly dropped out of sight from the village. they oppose the current shinobi alliance and the central figure among them is a jonin named ganryu. is that the one who injured akatsuchi. yes. he is the sole survivor of an incident known as the tragedy of yosuga pass. yosuga pass. you're probably aware of the deepseated hostility between the mist and the stone. that incident is said to have started the hostility. about ten years ago, the hidden cloud went around collecting jutsu from each of the nations. they seized a highly confidential document from us. on that day, in a team led by ganryu, the hidden stone, along with our allies the mist, set out to recover the document. stay alert. the cloud are just up ahead. no need to worry. we have our allies from the stone beyond this point. that may be so, but. if this mission is a success, we will show the rest of the lands that there is solidarity between the stone and mist. that way, we can get a little bit closer to peace. suiren. that's what i wish. i hope it could be like that some day. wwhy. we are supposed to be allies. hand it over. our mission is to return home with that document. this is absolutely. unforgivable. suiren. i wish i could have seen. peace. suiren. junsai. "that way, we can get a little bit closer to peace," huh. ganryu. he continues to hate the hidden stone. perhaps that is why it was difficult for him to accept this new alliance. don't tell me that's why he attacked us. i believe he intends to get his revenge by assassinating you, the messengers of the stone, and by destroying the alliance which he opposes. as if we'd stand by and allow such a thing to happen.. uh, where are you going. i'll get him before he gets me. please wait. we will settle this matter. hey. you guys take care of akatsuchi. the world of the ninja is ruled by hatred. and if i can't find the answer, perhaps i will entrust you to find it. what's the big idea, underling. i understand you're angry because your friend was hurt. but don't go. so i should wait quietly until he comes for me. that's not what i mean. if you go, one of you will die. and it'll be him. that's not it. i can't allow you two.  to fight.  to fight. what the hell are you talking about. if you think you can stop me, just try. damn it. there's no end to this. we're not going to let you go. why you. not again. we won't let you pass. for an underling, you sure have a nasty jutsu for stalling people. i'll go and settle this. so go back and stay with your friend. i don't want to. don't underestimate me. i have to hurry. one of the messengers got away from chojuro and is headed this way. perfect. this calls for an ambush, ganryu. no. you guys stay out of this. you can return to the village. what are you saying.. he's right. the hidden stone killed my father. i want to be a part of this.  me too.  he's right, ganryu. think about those you left behind. your anger and your hatred. i will take every shred of those feelings with me. but.. why do you interfere. i'm naruto uzumaki of the hidden leaf. the nine tails' jinchuriki. i heard your story. but i came to stop you. my master was killed by pain. so i understand the bitterness you feel. but you have to stop this. i heard you killed pain and got your revenge. you're wrong. he just used up all of his power. are you telling me you didn't want revenge. of course not. when he stood before me, i was consumed with hate. i wanted to kill him so much that my entire body shook. but i realized that wasn't enough. why not. because that just starts a cycle of hatred. once it begins, the cycle will keep going for both sides. revenge begets revenge. and people dear to us will die, one after the other. i see. but i'm fully aware of that already. then why.. there's no other path to take. in order to make her wish come true. what are you talking about. if an incident of revenge occurs here the five kage will be forced to think seriously. about the difficulty and risk involved in maintaining an alliance. and they'll also be forced to think about peace. peace. a village looks out for its own interests. villages form alliances, but easily go back on them to suit their needs. for the sake of their villages, shinobi have committed betrayals, and fought and killed one another time and time again. how many shinobi do you think exist within each of the five great nations, who harbor hatred towards shinobi from different lands. this time, i started it. but this kind of occurrence happens all the time. and not everyone can suppress their desire for revenge like you. an alliance formed only by the higher ranks will just end up repeating the past. that's not true. because i'll change the future. how can you be so sure. my master and my fellow shinobi have entrusted me to find the answer to deal with hatred. the answer to stop this cycle of revenge. the answer to foster understanding between shinobi. they put their faith in me, and i'm going to find the answer. so have some faith in me too, old man. even it happens gradually, i'll get closer to this thing called peace. and we will be just a little bit closer to peace. suiren. i found you, ganryu. you. are you crazy.. jumping in front of him like that. don't worry. this is nothing. are you kidding me. i used full force just now. i can't afford.to die here. i have too much to do still. hey, is it going to be my fault if you die.. is this going to become an international incident.. you must be kidding me. don't die. i'm not. i'm just resting because it hurts. naruto uzumaki. i understand. i'll put my trust in you. stop right there. i'm taking you into custody. if you resist.. i have no intention of resisting. also please tend to his wounds. hey, you from the mist. what happened to akatsuchi.. i left a medical ninja to treat him. his injuries are not lifethreatening. i see. ganryu. here. the messenger you injured entrusted this to me. this is. he returned the personal effects of those who died at yosuga pass. along with a formal apology for that incident. that was the true purpose of the messengers dispatched by lord tsuchikage. the hidden stone. apologized for that incident. he did. that stubborn old man. this was in order to strengthen the new alliance between the mist and stone. i see. what's going to happen to that guy. he will either be executed or released. he committed a serious crime. i'm sure he is prepared to face the consequences. i don't think it will come to that. i got hurt because i made a wrong turn and stumbled. right, kurotsuchi. are you saying this makes up for that incident in the past. i'm just going to have the mist owe us one. that's all. maybe the old man wasn't the only one who had a change of heart because of the kazekage. kazekage. hey, you mist. remember, you owe us one. oh, yes. thank you very much. and you, leaf underling. hey, your wound is still. sorry, but i left my comrades waiting. see you. the least he could've done was introduce himself. hey, what happened to you anyway.. well, how should i put it. i made a wrong turn and stumbled. stumbled. where. aoba. is that all you're going to say. never mind already. we have an early start tomorrow, right. so let's get everything ready, and then hit the sack. well, we had a change of plans. we got word that the ship from the land of lightning is coming to pick us up directly. it should be here soon. oh, there it comes. that's.. it's here. that must be the octopus coming to guide me. all right. will we clash or be a smash. if i dare say, it will be a nogo, whee. i'm a brathating outlaw. who's this old man with the weird rhymes. next time on naruto shippuden: "land ahoy. is this the island of paradise." this old man's the eight tails' jinchuriki. tune in again. )
