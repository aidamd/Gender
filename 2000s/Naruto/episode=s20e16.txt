jiraiya ninja scrolls: the tale of naruto the herothe mutual path i'll soon reach the limit of the chidori's destructive power. i just need to make it evolve nicely. but how. father. what's the use if i can't even ask him for advice. i've made up my mind to surpass him. father, do you have some time. i'm busy right now. come back later. big brother. join us. i have something important to discuss. and have you made up your mind. yes, father. it's what i've decided after working closely with lord fourth. it seems he is serious about changing the way the uchiha are treated. i want to believe him. i see. however. that means that we must change too. we've put too much distance between everyone else and us. that has become an obstacle to a settlement. and. what are your thoughts. we have to show them that we have no ill will. as a clan who is part of this village, we must pledge loyalty to lord fourth and aggressively do our best to cooperate so they'll accept our conditions only if we show them obedience.. no, that's not the case. this is just my personal observation. that's just too convenient. be quiet, sasuke. this is itachi talking here. i'm sure he came to this conclusion after careful thought. but. besides, we have long desired to participate in government. originally, our ancestors chose to live here after fighting in wars that sought blood for blood. we must strive to find common ground. thank you. you always do this, father. anyway, this is sudden, but. i've been given a request from the hokage. you're quite cunning. first, you make sure i'm in an amenable mood. a mission to guard an official from the feudal lord's office, a vip. it's a direct request from the feudal lord. the hidden leaf will be dispatching an escort unit. it will be a longterm mission. if we accept this mission, failure is not an option. let's immediately go through selections. it's always like this. father only sees big brother. no matter how hard i try. why did i think you would be like itachi. your older brother would have done better. this is itachi talking here. i'm sure he came to this conclusion after careful thought. he never acknowledges me. see. didn't i tell you, naruto. sasuke's mastered chidori. you're right. i said it to him first, but he's surpassed me. sasuke. i brought some refreshments. let's have some together. you're being a nuisance. sasuke. what are you doing.. apologize to sakura, now. don't order me around. a loser has no right to talk. i'm not ordering you. and i'm not a loser. i've already caught up to you. you just can't accept it. why you. don't be so stuckup. you, equal to me. impossible. do you wanna put that to a test right now. fine. hey, you guys, stop it. sasuke. stop. dad. sorry, but fights are forbidden inside the village. lord fourth. thank you. i'm so sorry, sakura. where is he.. ouch. sasuke. what is that power.. how did he. i'll never accept you. i promise i'll knock you down. i didn't formulate the rasengan to hurt my friends. why did you do that. i was frustrated. i've always tried to catch up to him. but he refuses to acknowledge me. people's feelings are complicated. but. but. i'm never gonna give up. even if it's impossible now, i'm gonna become much stronger. i'm gonna get him to acknowledge me someday. i thought you were listening to our conversation the other day. so you're going to criticize me again without even asking about the circumstances. what are your intentions. nothing. i'm just not going to expect anything from you anymore. i've decided i'm going to follow my own path. "your own path". yeah, that's right. and right now, i want power. i have just one request for you. all right. i'm gonna train hard again today. what is all this racket, this early in the morning. okay, here i go. naruto. sakura. what's the matter. it's awful. sasuke's. is it true, dad. sasuke's leaving our team.. yes, it's true. mr. fugaku came by a little earlier to inform me. sasuke will be joining the leaf police force from today. why so suddenly. what's going to happen to our team. to team 7. i'm gonna go ask him myself. hold on. just hold on. what's the big idea. sasuke has already left for the feudal lord's office. the uchiha have taken on a longterm escort mission. it's the uchiha's elite unit. sasuke wants to shadow and learn from the more experienced shinobi. it seems he made a strong appeal to join them. sasuke did. that's.way too sudden. we haven't even made amends yet. you're such an idiot. you should be a little happy for him. why should i. he volunteered for this mission in order to hone his skills. he probably made up his mind right after fighting with you and realizing something. then, he also.. right. like you, he "doesn't want to lose. " at least it means he's aware of you. i see. this isn't the time to relax. sasuke will become ridiculously strong, and when he comes back, he'll crush you and defeat you. no. that's not good. i have to train too. hurry. i have to start right now. all right, that's the spirit. i'll be rooting you from distant skies. hhold on, y'know. what you just said. aren't you gonna help me train, pervy sage.. my wounds are completely healed. i have to set out in search of orochimaru soon. no way. don't get so depressed. i'll watch over your training when i have a chance. but you're always so busy, dad. hey. why don't you take me with you. what.. you want to go on the journey too. it's the perfect idea. i'll get lots of training on the road. well, uh. jiraiya sensei. i don't mind. but i wonder what kushina will say. she's really strict when it comes to the three prohibitions of the shinobi and whatever. well, we just have to convince her. c'mon. let's go. you're so selfcentered. uum. believe so that means. naruto is leaving the team too. i'm so sorry. i'll start looking into where you can transfer to, so. no. i don't mind being on call. but. when naruto returns, we'll have our old team back. and even with sasuke, there's a chance he might have a change of heart. i understand. besides. there's something i want to do as well, while they're away. i think it will be a good opportunity. please. that jutsu you mentioned before, i'd like to learn it. i can't be the only one on the team who's lagging behind. i like that look on your face. fine. but i'm warning you. i won't go easy. yes. are you sure about this. i took you in because captain fugaku asked me to. but everyone in the unit is ranked way above you. the days will be long and hard at the feudal lord's office. i'm looking forward to it. after my father and brother, you're the most skilled among the uchiha. as long as my brother is on the hokage's detail. i've always assumed that you would be the next captain. and that's why you volunteered. i have a goal i must reach. and for that. all right, then it's fine by me. let's go. hey, i've been thinking from before. orochimaru is a bad guy, right. so why do you go out of your way to look for him. despite what he is now, he was once my friend. but one day, he went off the path. i should have set him right back then. i couldn't stop him. i can't help but to think. if i hadn't let him go, he could still be here. i don't want you to have the same kind of regrets. still, i haven't given up on him. i'll bring him back one day. yeah. you didn't have to see me off. now that won't do, y'know. now listen carefully, naruto. the three prohibitions of the shinobi must be strictly observed. jiraiya sensei tends to be too lax. don't you dare imitate his bad habits. i'm sorry. she insisted on seeing you off. that goes without saying, y'know. what if naruto picks up bad habits while accompanying sensei on his intel gathering.. pitterpatter i worry enough about his antics and recklessness. don't worry. if he gets in my way, i'll just transport him away to mount myoboku or someplace. mount myoboku. no matter what kind of food you're served, just hang in there. uuhhuh. hey. be careful on your journey. you guys. just don't go overboard. if you try too hard, you'll make us look like we're slacking off. what're you saying.. we're going to work hard too. i refuse to be a genin forever. i'll have you know, i'm on track to go straight to the top. i already have a place to train. huh.. when did this happen.. i'm not going to lose to naruto. roger, y'know. hey. it's about time to leave. right. i'm ready. okay. i'm off, y'know. i can't believe that a shinobi of your caliber failed. if that plan succeeded, we could have gotten rid of the faction of moderate jonin who support the fourth hokage in one swoop, and spread our political influence. you can't blame it all on me. the plan failed due to the shinobi that hizashi assembled. since you installed hizashi as the pointperson for this plan, some of the blame lies with you. i did what i was supposed to do. so i expect the contract to be honored. i understand. what are your wishes for the next vessel. well. actually, itachi would have been ideal. but it was too late this time. the next time around, he'll be past his prime. i see. i'll choose a suitable candidate who possesses even better qualities than itachi, one who will reach his physical peak in three years' time. yes, i'm counting on you. someone young, beautiful, and strong. an ideal body. not yet. ouch. chidori stream. all right. that's pretty good. so you're going back to the hidden leaf village as soon as your replacement arrives. yeah. i've learned everything i can here. besides, i have a goal i have to fulfill. it's none of my business, but. it's good to have a goal. but getting too attached to a goal can lead someone off the right path. i want you to remember that. your interference is unnecessary. thanks for the last three years. i want to make sure with my own eyes. but i guess it's out of the question since i'm stuck here. you're back. i heard the report. only the elite were sent there. but i understand that you've developed into a shinobi who's second only to shisui. it's no big deal. i'll surpass itachi, soon. listen to you, such confidence now. this is. a lieutenant's armband for the leaf police force. talk is easy. now demonstrate your skills in a real mission. looking forward to it. i've returned, to dispel the humiliation of that day. and this time. i'll take you down and prove to you who's stronger. the recent activities of the leaf police force are unpardonable. it must be a form of protest. they're annoyed because their circumstances remained unchanged. they're starting to lose patience. especially the younger generation. and the one at the center of all of this is. next time on naruto shippuden: "the difference in power. " sasuke, huh. one of the most gifted members of the uchiha clan. jiraiya ninja scrolls: the tale of naruto the hero"the mutual path" tune in again. )
