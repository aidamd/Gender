" nimble, eh. all right. naruto. what're you doing.. nimbly showing determination. stupid naruto. we have no choice. let's go. weren't you listening earlier.. well, i'm just following the tiger scroll. do you feel the current picking up. iis it because of that. we did it. we did it. we'll crash onto the rocks. even if you miss the rocks, we'll fall under the waterfall. why are you talking like an observer. huh. i'm just making a calm assessment. stop it, both of you. you should talk. start doing something. what.. shut up. damn, what does it mean by "show determination". what's that. that rock looks like a miniature version of the hidden leaf village's great stone faces. what. shikamaru. what do we do.. we have to hurry or we'll crash. show determination, huh. i have determination. naruto no matter what, i'm gonna get the fourth hokage's legacy. naruto. how many times do i have to this one time, naruto is right. jump to the right. i see it was set up like this beneath the waterfall. a rainbow forms on the left side with the water spray, but not on the right side. if we had chosen the left side, we'd have been eliminated. hey, you're heavy. hurry up and move. huh. what are you saying. are you calling me heavy. you're one to talk. yes, i'm calling you heavy, ino pig. stop kidding around, billboard brow. this is a fight that has absolutely nothing to do with me nope. you three are all pretty heavy. huh.. what.. what.. jeez, naruto, you don't have a shred of delicacy. i pity you, sakura being stuck on the same team with a guy like that. really. whwhy. final hurdle all right. we're at the final hurdle. huh.. ino. you choji. you sorry, naruto, but we're going alone from here on. we're taking the fourth hokage's legacy. hey this is unfair. we want shikamaru to win, no matter what. shikamaru, now's our chance. shikamaru. "go beyond hatred. " "for the one who approaches, the path will not open. " that's what the poem says next. maybe it means the path won't open if you have a falling out with comrades. now you're sounding like a decent guy. you've really become a pain. that's very fitting of you to say that, shikamaru. well, i figured it would turn out like this. huh. let's both get through this and meet in the finals. here, this is yours. i'm returning it to you. you actually think you'll be in the finals. she's right. sasuke's the one who will advance. huh.. well, as long as it's someone from the hidden leaf. yyeah, that's right. all right. let's go. unfortunately you guys won't be in the final round. you won't be as lucky this time. wow all these scrolls have secret techniques written inside. i don't know. we have to find the real secret among these. and the clock's gonna be ticking while we do this. there's no mistake. fourth hokage's legacy is here somewhere. let's open up every one of them. stop. look at the size of this sacred place. who knows what kind of trap has been laid. besides, the scrolls in here are all probably fakes. it'll take days to check this volume of scrolls. we'll never break the fourth hokage's record time. there has to be something something. some way a way just use your head. stupid naruto. sakura that was mean. stupidstupid stupidstupid stupidstupid. stupidstupid give me a break. stop saying that already. that's not me. stupidstupidstupid naruto. why you. stupid parrot. you have no right to call me stupid. stupid naruto. stupid naruto. quit saying stupid, stupid. stupid naruto. stupid, stupid. why you. ninja art: grudge rain. one on one, we can't beat them. but if i gather our grudge and put a curse on them with a jutsu enshroud them in the cursed cloud and rain grudge upon them. stupid naruto. stupid naruto. come down from there. stupid. stupid parrot. shikamaru. mmy chakra what's this. i feel my power draining. this isnot ordinary water. this rain sucks out your chakra. it is a rain of tears from all the grudges we hold against you. why are guys like you, who didn't pass the chunin exam, sneaking around here. although it is irritating to do as kakashi says you're the hidden leaf's he's right about this being a perfect chance to test my jutsu. sasuke uchiha. rretreat. wait, samidare. he's acting strange isn't this our chance. nno. let's get him. he's strong, after all. we don't have a chance against someone who made it through to the final round. we're saved. was this planned too. i'm starving i'll eat this. gimme, gimme. hey, thief. thank you. naruto. get close to the parrot. yummy. good. i get it. this is my chance to catch that revolting parrot. no. huh. smile a little. be friendly as you approach. wha. how. llike this. little parrot. hello. stupid naruto. stupid. stupid. smile, naruto. whwhy. his smile is creepy. be more natural. yeah, it's easy for you to say. think happy thoughts. sakura shikamaru must have something planned. go for it, naruto. if you say so, sakura, i'll do my best. smile. don't forget to smile. just like that, naruto. pretty good. happy thoughts happy thoughts i'll become a chunin and go on a loveydovey date with sakura. oh yuck. "go beyond hatred" "for the one who approaches, the path will not open. " so that meant the gate wouldn't open as long as naruto kept chasing the parrot. oh. here it is. fourth hokage's legacy. the final lines of the poem "the location of infinity, to the one anointed. " does that mean this scroll contains everything. yeah although there could be some unthinkable trap. i believe in that tiger scroll. that old sage gave it to us. that's why it's suspect. yikes. yikes. guy sensei. why are you here.. shikamaru. you too, choji and ino, what're you talking about.. where is bushy brow sensei.. huh.. huh.. you still believe it's an old sage, naruto. say, old sage. what about it. did we break the fourth hokage's record. did we make it in time. i really, really want fourth hokage's legacy. i need it in order to get through the final round. ahem. you shattered the fourth hokage's old record. yay. and soi shall present you with fourth hokage's legacy, the ultimate secret. yeah, yeah. read the first characters of each verse across the page. i wish you luck. farewell. it was so obvious umm "close the blade" "calm the heart" huh. bladeheart. a blade with a heart means "ninja. " oh yeah. then let's see there is no shortcut to what is essential in a ninja "there is no shortcut to what is essential in a ninja. " huh.. huh.. good work. sure thing. it was good training for passing the final round. and we were able to assess their mastery of their jutsu quite nicely. sasuke, you're taking too long to release that jutsu. it won't be effective in the final round. i know. we're leaving, guy. sasuke still needs some training. yup. leave the rest to me. cripes, choji. does it mean this was all guy sensei's joke on us.. well i'm just as disappointed as you. that was so mean laying such dangerous traps too. doesn't he have better things to do with his time.. don't be so quick to judge him. after passing through several hurdles, didn't you notice something. at first, we were only thinking about our team winning. that's true. and now, we just want someone from our village to win. yeah i know. huh. huh. there is no shortcut to what is essential in a ninja. don't take the shortcut. just take the long way. all right. sakura. shikamaru. choji. ino. we're gonna start all over again. what.. what.. he's a pain, after all. stupid. stupid. the final round of the chunin exam began the next day. when the fireworks suddenly explode in the air fui ni agatta hanabi wo futari de miageta toki i couldn't keep my eyes off from your face muchuu de miteru kimi no kao wo sotto nusumimita no i gazed at you quietly it'd be so much easier if i was able to hate you kimi no koto kirai ni naretara ii noni because i always remember you, in situations like this kyou mitai na hi ni wa kitto i can't help but think about the times we spent together. mata omoidashiteshimau yo i'm ready to forget you mou wasureyou kimi no koto zenbu it just tears at my heart too much. konna ni mo kanashikute i wonder why did we meet each other. doushite deatteshimattan darou when i close my eyes me wo tojireba it's like you are here. ima mo kimi ga soko ni iru you de i want to hear what you have to saythen decide. fine, i will show you our pain. nagato. this is a waste of time. let's deal with him right now. wait, konan i want to hear his answer. he crushed the six pains and made it here alone. next time on naruto shippuden: "meeting" two moments define my greatest pain. tune in again. )
