jiraiya ninja scrolls: the tale of naruto the herocollision there it is. that tower is sasuke's goal. where's sasuke. he's already inside. our strategy to weaken them one by one is making them impatient. those two plan on settling this all at once. there are just two of them, but there are three of us. it's no big deal. no, actually, there are quite a few problems. neji, i'm counting on you. ive got it. the three of us can handle the two of them. don't worry, just run. it's useless. the entry to the suspension bridge is already within the range of my eight trigrams. neither of you can enter this area. i wonder about that. a clone. damn it. i guess i shouldn't get too greedy, because one is my quota. i will not let you pass. striking shadow snakes. gentle fist. he's here. damn it.from above. hurry to the entrance. naruto, are you all right.. yeah, i'm okay. sasuke is up there. naruto. go on ahead. i'll stop him. what are you talking about. you're coming with.. no.don't tell me it's because i'm the hokage's son.. that's right. you're the hokage's son. in my own way, i've watched you two all this time. the one who can sway sasuke. the one who can bring sasuke back is you, naruto. you're the only one who can do it. shikamaru. he's coming. hurry, naruto. yeah. i'm counting on you, shikamaru. shadow possession jutsu. complete. so you're a shadow user. sorry, but. .you're going to keep me company right here. i bear no grudge toward any one of you. this is my mission. by the way, did you happen to catch what the weather report was today. it's supposed to be cloudy with some rain. damn it, this is not my kind of thing. you must be sasuke. i've been waiting for you. you're orochimaru. i understand there's something you desire very much. it's power. enough power to be able to hold this world within my fist. such a promising statement. i'm sorry. i took a shortcut and i've been waiting for you. just a little farther, and i'll catch up to sasuke. why are you interfering.. you won't get to sasuke. i won't let you go any further. shut up. i won't let sasuke become a vessel. this chakra is. you want it, don't you, kid. you want my power. four tails.so suddenly. how can this be. hokage style elder jutsu: tenth edict on enlightenment. what. is this even possible. the fifth tail.. power. hurry and give me power. how impatient. he stopped. sasuke. you can't do that after coming this far. you need my power, don't you. i don't need power. i just want to talk to sasuke. so can you back off right now. sasuke. what happened to you. that's amazing, sasuke. your body is already adapting to the power. you must be orochimaru. wwhat did you do to sasuke.. i fulfilled sasuke's desire, that's all. what did you say. you're still annoying as ever. sasuke. i'm here to bring you back. give me a break. what can a loser like you do. i'll bring you back by force, if necessary. just try it. i'm not going to lose to you. i feel a surge of power. what is this power. this is different.even compared to the other day. don't you get it, sasuke.. orochimaru is. trying to make you his. it's power. as long as i have power, that doesn't matter to me. chidori stream. change in chakra form comes so easily. this power. i'll show you the enormous difference in my power. all right.i'll show you too. what power is.. well, how about it. it should be fully infused by now. get ready, sasuke. what. what happened to him. just plain taijutsu. is that all. what. i thought i dodged it with my sharingan.. this boy. used nature energy. it's sage mode. all this power. naruto. why do you... why does it always have to be you.. stop saying nonsense and let's go home. that power has a time limit. well then. fire style: dragon flame jutsu. you disgust me, naruto. get lost. disappear along with the thunder. you lost focus, didn't you. your real target is over here. sasuke. you'd really do this. what's so funny. sasuke. i've always thought that you and i were alike. what are you saying. i'm the hokage's son. you're the son of the leaf's police force chief, from the prestigious uchiha clan. we both grew up constantly being compared to our dads. how hard it is to live under someone's shadow. to always be watched by others. i thought you were the one person who understood all that. even though our situations were the same, you were totally different. you kept progressing and getting better. at first, i was frustrated. but then, i was proud of you. that's why i decided to do my best and be like you. you've been my role model all this time. well, i'm different. you should've just stayed the same. why couldn't you have just stayed a loser. the weak and useless son of the hokage.. sasuke. even you.even you had to become strong. you don't know how much that made me.. is that why. is that why you sought power.. that's right, naruto. the power to bring you down. you're the one. who's a loser. wwhat is this red chakra. he still has power like this.. naruto. his power is levels above this. you have no choice but to use my power. i'm gonna stop you even if i have to break every bone in your arms and legs. just what are you.. i'm your friend. that's why i'm saying i'm never gonna let orochimaru have you. fine, i acknowledge you. i'll fight you as an equal from now. however, you won't be able to put a single mark on my headband. sasuke. rasengan. chidori. big brother. i came to bring you back, but it seems i'm a little late. no way. naruto. naruto, please get along with my little brother. forgive me, sasuke. that was quite entertaining. wwhat is that. as you can see, it's something that defies the boundaries of reality. neji, is everyone in the village safe. can you confirm what that big thing is with your byakugan. i'm already doing that. next time on naruto shippuden: "another moon" i don't know what kind of jutsu that is, but i'll undo it. jiraiya ninja scrolls: the tale of naruto the heroanother moon tune in again. )
