it's been so long since we traveled on land. solid ground under our feet feels great. no doubt about it, this hot blood of mine is bonded to land. well, this is only until we reach the next harbor. about that, can't we change plans and go to the land of lightning by land. i doubt it. we are presently in the territory of the land of water. the land of water is made up of large and small islands. so they are not connected to the land of lightning. well. just the thought of getting on a boat again. so are we still far away from the land of lightning. yes. we have a quarter of a ways to go. by the way, i overheard this back at the harbor, but it seems some imposters may show up. an imposter. what kind of imposter. hey, hey, hey. i have nothing against you. just call it a twist of fate. i'm taking everything you own. who are you. that headband. that's right. the great ninja who kicked the akatsuki out of the hidden leaf village. naruto uzumaki, that's me. seems he just appeared. then that imposter you mentioned. that's right. he's supposed to be naruto. he's the spitting image of you. as if. hey, hey, hey. how dare you ignore me. what's so funny. damn it. hey, if you're naruto uzumaki of the hidden leaf, then who the hell am i supposed to be. don't you know your own name. how come you have hidden leaf headbands too. don't tell me. i'm the real naruto uzumaki.  no way.  it's true. imagine that, an imposter of naruto. i guess that's the price you pay for fame. and just who are you. i'm. hold it now. if i can beat him here. all right then. let's fight, right here and now, to see who is the real naruto. quit talking nonsense. naruto, do your best. if you lose, we'll make him the real naruto. i guess i have no choice. naruto's imposter you're all talk. that didn't even count as a warmup. we'll be confiscating what you have. but what'll we do with him. we're in a hurry. a guy like him. let's just toss him over there. are you sure about that. if he gets away and starts stirring up trouble again, your reputation will take a hit. that is a problem. hey wait, wait. and who're you. my name's iggy and i've been after this thief. him. yeah. the only ones brave enough to stand up to this guy are myself and probably you. this guy is the notorious thief everyone is afraid of. naruto uzumaki. no. he is not naruto uzumaki. how would you know a thing like that. because i'm the real naruto uzumaki. what. you're the real one. damn it. what a jerk. using my name and robbing people. if you're chasing the thief, does that make you an officer of the law. wwell, i guess you could say that. then let's leave the rest in his hands. we should be on our way. sounds good. hey buddy, can you manage him. you don't look that strong. what are you saying. i may not look it, but. i am the master ninja iggy. no kidding. are you that strong. looks sure can be deceiving. well then, please take care of things here. okay, let's go. damn it. sorry, partner. you idiot. what if you were killed. are you stupid. i was going to beat him up. but you heard, didn't you. he was the real naruto uzumaki. yeah. of all places, i never expected to encounter the real guy here. you idiot. that's enough of your excuses, banna. according to our plan, you're the troublemaker and i'm going to beat you up and build up my reputation. war's about to break out. i have to do something like this to build myself up. by beating naruto uzumaki, i'll make a name for myself. i know that. but isn't it time we stopped dangerous stuff like this. you jerk. did you forget what you owe me. if it weren't for me, you'd still be all alone, crying your eyes out. isn't that right. ii'm sorry. iggy, you're my one and only friend. next time, let's find someone weaker that even we can beat. why you. "that even we can beat".. a naruto uzumaki or two would be a piece of cake for me. forgive me, iggy. as long as you understand, it's okay. is it true that naruto uzumaki is robbing people in these parts. yeah, no doubt about it. there have been a number of victims. he's supposedly a giant with a reddish face. but why would naruto uzumaki stoop to robbery here. isn't he a hero who saved his village. i don't know the details, but there are also rumors that naruto uzumaki was considered a nuisance. maybe he became a rogue ninja. if he's a deserter, then the hidden leaf must be after him too. if we capture him, the hidden leaf will pay us handsomely. but can we do it. after all, he's naruto uzumaki. don't panic. from what i hear, naruto uzumaki didn't even pass the chunin exam. the legend of him being a hero is probably a big exaggeration. i get it. for mercenary ninja like us, he means money, right. exactly. well, considering my strength, i actually don't need to resort to this stuff. come one, come all. i preserve the peace for the people and the world. the great iggy, that's me. you're so cool, iggy. when you're serious, you're really strong, iggy. you could fight in the war anytime. damned right i can. forget farming. i'm going to be a war hero. here, put this on. then you'll be naruto uzumaki again. hey look, banna. i mean, naruto. here come our victims. there's no way you can lose to peddlers like them. nope. all right. here i go. hey, hey, hey. i have nothing against you. just call it a twist of fate. i, naruto uzumaki, will be taking all your belongings. did you say naruto uzumaki. uh yeah.that's right. so just put everything down and leave. wwhat the hell. aren't they peddlers. this is perfect. naruto uzumaki, eh. imagine, you coming to us. wwhat'd you say. capture him. no way. wwait. he's not naruto uzumaki. he's just a petty thief named banna. what. but he looks just like how rumors describe him. and he's wearing a hidden leaf headband. well, that's because i. who are you. are you his partner. interfere and we'll get rid of you too. no, i. he's wrong. i'm naruto uzumaki. he's not my partner. he's just a lowclass farmer from a mountain village. he hates working the fields, so he pretends to be a ninja. he thinks my capture will be his ticket to fame. that's why he's hanging around. banna. sheesh, a ninja wannabe. well then, stay out of the way. or we'll take care of you too. let's go. what do i do. what do i do.. finally, i'm not hungry anymore. well, we'd better hurry. wait, wait, wait. please wait up. thank goodness i found you. what's the matter. well, i hate to say this, but some other thieves took the thief you left in my custody. what.. i have to ask you a favor. please get that thief back. i thought you were a master ninja. can't you get him back yourself. aactually, i'm out of shape right now. a ninja's always supposed to be in shape. sorry, but we have urgent business to attend to. and besides, aren't you an officer of the law. why don't you go back to your headquarters and get backup. well, that's. so the thieves catch a thief. i'd say they're birds of a feather. you reap what you sow. no, it's not like that. he may've done wrong, but he really wasn't that bad. because of his looks and size, people didn't like him. they were scared of him. he was always such a weakling and kindhearted. he's good at taking care of people. you sure know a lot about him. well. are you really an officer. i had my suspicions about you from the very beginning. all right. i'll be honest with you. i'll tell you everything. and that's it. what were you doing. how could you think of something so stupid. please help me. you're the hero who saved the hidden leaf village, right. hey, if you were his friend, how could you let him do such a thing. if you were his friend, why didn't you seriously think about his wellbeing.. friend. ggive me a break. he's not a friend. he's stupid. it was just convenient. that's why we stayed together. he's not a friend. "not a friend". what's the big idea.. then just what is he to you.. you might have come this far thinking he was just an idiot. but haven't you two been together since you were kids. you've survived together. wouldn't you consider that being friends.. naruto. this is an order. okay, i got it. if we had time, we would want to help you. but that's just not possible right now. right now, we cannot afford to have our identities and whereabouts known. you must forget you met us here too. let's go. wait. please. i can't do it by myself. you heard us. we can't help you. that's. then what am i supposed to do. it's your problem. you figure it out yourself. he's my friend. paper bombs. who is it.. iggy. why are you doing this. you. i knew it. you're his partner. i'm not his partner. he's not my friend either. he's. my best friend. iggy. why you. damn it. they got away. after them. banna, are you all right. why. damn it. you're hopeless. if i didn't save you, what'll happen to our next strategy. iggy. all these years, i've done nothing but use you. that isn't true. everyone hated me and looked at me like i was the devil himself. but you became my friend. you idiot. back then, the others bullied me too. they told me that if i teased you, they wouldn't bully me. i know that. but. iggy, you became my best friend. come on out, naruto uzumaki. we won't let you get away again. let's show them our willpower once last time. wherever you go, i'll follow you, iggy. let's do it. right. you novice. you think you can beat us with that skill level. take naruto uzumaki alive. kill the other one. i'm sorry. if i were strong like naruto, i could've protected you. banna. run. banna. thanks for calling me your best friend. die. banna. what.. damn it. you two are something else. yyou guys. sorry, but we didn't believe you back there. so we decided to test you. test me. right now, i am totally moved. you didn't abandon your friend. you put your faith in friendship. hey, hey, hey. just who do you think this person is. this here is the hero who saved hidden leaf village, the one and only naruto uzumaki. shape up. you are naruto uzumaki. naruto. that's right. you're the hero of justice. naruto uzumaki. naruto uzumaki is going to go on a rampage of a lifetime. you can have your name back, naruto uzumaki. the weight of it is too heavy to bear. thank you, naruto. don't mention it. but what'll you do from now. do you really intend to become ninja. nah, i'm going to forget about it. if this is how scary it is, it's not for me. i'm going back to the country and make an honest living. i'll go wherever iggy goes. i see. stay best friends forever, guys.  naruto.  naruto. thank you. take care. those guys sure can yell. take good care of yourselves. best friends are the greatest. we'll be like them too, someday. sand jonin temari, you will accept my challenge. huh. what are you talking about. my name is konohamaru sarutobi. grandson of the third hokage, naruto's favorite student. naruto's.. running away from this challenge will mean that you fear me. next on naruto shippuden: "naruto's favorite student" this should be fun. i'll indulge you for a little bit. tune in again. )
