the cavein that suddenly occurred swallowed up the siblings. yahiko, konan and nagato, who call themselves team jiraiya, immediately went after them. but, shikamaru did not budge. this is bad. we have to save those kids. wait. we can't. don't go. why. shikamaru. jiraiya ninja scrolls: the tale of naruto the hero order of priority the enemy's up ahead. watch out. what is that. what do you see, hinata. looks like the ground caved in. do you see shikamaru and his team. no. there's no a sign of them. i can't track their scent because of the cavein. i won't be able to until the dust settles. i can't believe the cavein could be just a coincidence. hey, can you hear me. hey, kids. hey. please answer us. where are you. we're coming to save you. could they have been swept away. let's go. my. my eyes.did this again. they did this to those kids. nagato. look. we have to find those kids first. just focus on that right now. is this really okay. are you sure we don't have to help rescue them. those guys are on their way. that's not the point. it just doesn't seem right. think about our priorities. right now, our team captains have been taken and our mission is at a standstill. it's our priority to regroup with the other teams and come up with a plan of action. i know that, but. the shinobi who were here in the village have gone to rescue them. we have to do what we came here to do. even if it is a drag. we can't afford to be indecisive. let's move to a bigger area where kiba and akamaru can track us easily. the leaf isn't coming after us. now we know what they're really like inside. this should be good enough. i'll let him know just what happened. yahiko. konan. this tunnel. hey. what's the matter. these walls.this tunnel. were they.created naturally. wwhat.. lord mashima. lord mashima. please protect my sons. please. please. please protect them and keep them safe. i'm sorry to interrupt your prayers. we're just passing through, but. what is this. it's lord mashima. he sleeps beneath the earth. .and protects our village. did something happen in the village. we maintained a modest, peaceful way of life, so as not to awaken lord mashima. but then, just recently, strangers came to our village and warned us it might become a battlefield. they told us to evacuate to a safer place for a while. we were forced to leave our village. but. my two boys returned to the village. i tried to go after them, but they were much faster and we got separated. that's why i'm praying to lord mashima for their safety. lord mashima. here it comes. it's huge. what is it. not good. there's no place to escape. you saved us, nagato. thank you. we barely made it. what was that just now. i don't know. we have to get to the kids. what is that. kakashi sensei. kakashi sensei. come here, if you want to save them. if you don't, i'll execute them. don't move. guy sensei. calm down. don't fall for their trap. we have to get word of this to the leaf village as soon as possible. yes. we'll have to break up into two teams. one stays here, the other goes to notify the village. no. there's a chance we'll be ambushed on the way. we have to maintain our combat power as much as possible. you'll abandon your friends. to follow the rules. so the essence of the hidden leaf has been passed down to its younger generation too. that's right. and that's how it should be. whoever he is, that guy is trying to challenge us. and break up our strength. i'm. i'm not like you.  what.  i'll never turn my back on them.  naruto.  why that. come back. i'll go. take care of things here. neji. big brother. we lost kenta. we'll find him later. you promise. big brother. big brother, i'm scared. it's all right. kenta. hey, shikamaru. let's not do this. i don't think this is right. deities are supposed to be inside these shrines, right. you're asking for divine punishment. i knew it. i was right, after all. okay. let's go meet this lord mashima. what. this is. come on. i'll filet you into three pieces. nagato. there they are. it's coming. what. a second one.. stay away. expansion jutsu. human boulder. komichi. shadow strangle jutsu. you guys. .came. what happened to neji and naruto. what was that just now. it's probably some kind of timespace jutsu. but who could use such a highlevel ninjutsu. damn it. thanks to him, we have more trouble to deal with. where are we. i don't know. are you the one responsible for all this. hey. return kakashi sensei and everyone else from the hidden leaf. or else.you're gonna get it. naruto, get away from him. don't butt in. i'm about to settle this right now. look at his eyes. huh. the byakugan. you're no match for him. who are you. how do you possess the byakugan. don't tell me you have ties to the hyuga. look at the cloud of dust. your comrades did that. what happened. they put their village's rules before the lives of children. the hidden leaf hasn't changed a bit in all these years. what would you know about the hidden leaf. oh, i know plenty. in fact, i know more than anyone presently here. follow me. neji hyuga. if you want to know the ugly truth that the hidden leaf has covered up in this village. what. what is he talking about. let's hurry back to the village and report our present status. we don't want any more casualties. what are you saying. it's not just guy sensei, but neji is missing. as well as naruto, who's on your team. next time on naruto shippuden: "the masked man" this all happened because he was being out of line. jiraiya ninja scrolls: the tale of naruto the hero  the masked
