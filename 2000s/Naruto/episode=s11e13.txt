this will be a war unlike any other we've had. shikamaru, i need you in charge of the front lines. yes, ma'am. i'm counting on your sharp intellect. shikamaru, it's your turn. your mind seems somewhere else. are you scared. it's not that i'm scared. if i make one bad decision, my comrades will die. so what do i do. what will i be able to do. i have doubts. you are stuck in repetition too. repetition. when each player has the same pieces positioned on the shogi board, and the same pieces in hand, four repeated moves will force a draw. don't lose sight of your goal. go see naruto. there is a supply mission. it will be a nice diversion for you. you should go. i will recommend you. the closed route it's so quiet here. yeah. the large coral reefs around mokuzu island function as a natural breakwater. so the waves are very gentle and make it an ideal harbor. yes, this sea is like a mirror. having said that. mokuzu ramen we shouldn't linger here too long. hardaport. damn it. tasting local delicacies is part of the fun of traveling. the sun's gonna set real soon. why do we have to set sail without even docking. he may be the village hero, but he's still the same old naruto. how can you be so carefree at a time like this. did you say something. forget it. it doesn't concern you. in any case, why were you guys waiting at mokuzu island. replenishing supplies. supplies. so where are they. here. hhelp. what are you, a walking supply store. are you all right. don't just stand there watching. help me. i didn't find the answer by seeing naruto either, dad. the fog has gotten thick. be careful. don't worry. we have a compass. huh. that's strange. what's wrong. do i really have the power right now to command everyone and hold their lives in my hands. what should i do. what's the matter, shikamaru. oh.it's nothing. by the way, where's guy sensei. i don't see him. well, he's been seasick from the time we set out. even now, he's lying down in his quarters. good morning, everyone. guy sensei, you look fine. shikamaru, you're here. the ship's moving. are you all right. yes, i don't feel seasick at all today. what a great way to wake up. the fog is so dense, i can't see a thing. did you just notice that. seasickness has made you dense watch out. shadow strangle jutsu. that was a close call. i'm sorry about that. hey, there are rocks all around the ship. there shouldn't be any reef systems around here. hold the rudder steady. it's useless. i can't avoid the rocks. you can leave it to me, might guy. the leaf's burning youth. chesto. i'm not done yet. he's going wild. but that's so like guy sensei. bushy brow sensei, behind you. behind you. huh.. a rock this size is nothing. damn it. isn't there something we can do. yamato. i know. wood style. are you all right, captain yamato.. yeah. look at that. it's a huge whirlpool. what.. this ship doesn't have a chance if it's pulled into that thing. this isn't good. the rudder's not working. what are we gonna do.. naruto, use massive rasengan. what. massive rasengan. never mind. just hurl one in there. ookay. captain yamato, make sure you pull me back. you got it. now. they're a tough bunch. are we okay now. what the.. not again. damn it. i'll keep pulverizing every single one of them. chesto. what.. naruto. right. what is this. what is going on. this is too weird to be a natural phenomenon. our mission is to make sure naruto gets to the land of lightning safely. if this is a trick in order to abduct naruto, we have to identify the enemy. what.. this is the third time. is the enemy trying to make naruto and the others use up their chakra. but even now, i sense no presence of the enemy. could this be a genjutsu. no, that's the real thing. or, it could be the transportation technique. nope. a shinobi capable of laying down a massive spatial barrier like this wouldn't need to bother forcing us to use up our chakra. i'm all out of chakra. what.. this is the fourth time. just like the repetition move. guy sensei. it's hopeless. we've all run out of steam. i figured as much. this is a drag, but. i'm not only one left. controlling a vessel as heavy as a sailing ship won't be easy with my jutsu, but. i have no choice. shikamaru, i don't expect anything like that from you. what. leave the physical work to me. your job is to use your head to figure a way out of this. multi shadow clone jutsu. damn it. why was i so impatient. naruto is absolutely right. okay, let's review everything in order. what happened after we left the port. as soon as we pulled out of port, we were surrounded by fog. we were on the ocean, but guy sensei didn't get seasick at all. and the compass became unreliable. shortly afterwards, we sailed into a reef system that was not marked on the sea chart and a whirlpool appeared. a whirlpool is caused by complex terrain on the ocean bottom and shifts in sea level. damn it. today is a spring tide day. on top of that, there's only a narrow entryway to the bay. a large amount of water flowing in with the spring tide will easily form a whirlpool. guy sensei didn't get seasick because. it's such a quiet place. the calm waves of that huge bay held the ship steady. no doubt about it. there's a huge rock. everyone, hold steady. what's that.. when did that mark appear. so that means it's from the ship rubbing against that over and over. which means. we've been going around this bay in circles. rasengan. i've run out of chakra. there's another huge whirlpool. another one.. enough, naruto. i have an idea. what are you thinking about. we'll just sail straight for it and get swallowed up. what.. what on earth are you up to, shikamaru.. tenten, i need to borrow your power. that's what happens when you get caught in the devil's water trap of mokuzu island. they're dead at last. their ship has been swallowed up by the giant whirlpool and sent to the bottom of the sea. all right. operation over.  yay.  hurrah. we have a huge catch today. let's go get our shinobi treasure.  yeah.  yeah. hey. there's no debris from the ship floating around. what. maybe the treasure was so heavy, that everything sank. so every one of you on mozuku island is a thief. who the hell are you.. if you want our treasure so much, try and take it away. don't be scared. they should be completely exhausted from dodging the traps. don't underestimate shinobi.  tenten.  right. for a trap set by amateurs, it was pretty clever. damn it. i'm seasick again. shikamaru. your sharp intellect is pretty reliable, after all. i'm glad i met you. huh. what. nothing. just forget it. what, what. tell me. what is it. shut up, will you. you're such a pest. what. a pest.. what do you mean by that. don't just sigh. tell me. so barbeq's reopening. don't worry. i've already made reservations. beef tongue with salt, here i come. they have a special ladies combo on the new menu. it's a good deal. i just can't resist good deals. frankly, i just love offal. hey everyone, did you decide on your drinks. excuse me. we're ready to order. next time on naruto shippuden: "the girls' gettogether" i'm going to eat my fill today. tune in again. )
