this is. okay. which one's the fake.. why you.. what're you doing.. don't attack so recklessly. that guy. where have i seen him before. what. a samurai with ninja skills.. get back. put more space between you. what're you doing.. where's the sealing corps.. they got separated from the main company, thanks to those fakes. right now, we're waiting for reinforcements. hey, who the hell are you.. what do you mean, "who the hell are you".. you totally beat me up yesterday. you'd better not have forgotten. you're naruto.. yeah. you changed so much, so i didn't recognize you. by the way, who is he. oh, he's a reanimation. he looks like a samurai, but he's super strong. a samurai. get back, shinobi. i bear you no grudge. however, this body is being manipulated and i have no control over myself. furthermore, i am not a samurai. i abandoned the land of iron ages ago. i'm much like a ronin. no, that's not right. i am. old man. don't tell me you're old man tatewaki.. tatewaki, that is my name indeed. who might you be. you know him, naruto. naruto. did you say "naruto". yeah. it's me, naruto, old man tatewaki. so you're still alive. tell me. those two. what happened to those two. do your best, everyone this mission is a direct request from the feudal lord of the land of fire. bear in mind that this mission involves the nation's governance. what a pain. don't say that. will we have time to eat. talking about food again. why do you care. besides, how come you're here.. naruto will be joining shikamaru's team for this mission. huh. so what's this mission that we're supposed to go on with naruto. well, put bluntly. it's a kidnapping.  huh..  huh.. the young lord is a hostage in a castle in this nation. the mission is to kidnap the young lord without being discovered. so we kidnap the young lord, and then what. are we going to demand a ransom. get real. this is a political matter. his homeland has a treaty with this nation. but they want to nullify the treaty in order to establish an alliance with the land of fire. so the mission is to kidnap the young lord who is being held hostage here and take him home. so granny, what rank does this fall into. normally, it would be a brank mission. however, depending on how fortified the castle is, it may be bumped up to an arank mission. now you're talking. that makes it worth going. hey, we don't concern ourselves with stuff like that. anyway, i warned them that there's been suspicious activity around this nation. and it has something to do with the fact that his nation wants to cancel the treaty. if things go awry, this mission will become an a or srank very quickly. i want you as anbu to stay in the shadows and watch their backs. under what circumstances do i reveal myself. i want you to gather intel on anything suspicious too. i'll leave it up to your judgment. understood. the arank mission: food fight. hey, mister sasori. we've been getting petty missions lately. that's because we accept every request we get. moneymaking and mercenary jobs don't have an iota of art, hmm. i agree, but we have no choice but to listen to the organization. world conquest seems a long way off.  hey.  huh. hey, you're late. we have new missions. one is moneymaking. the other is war. making money doesn't excite me. yeah. well then, hidan and i'll take the moneymaking job. hey, hey. don't just decide. i'm not interested in money either. someone has to do it. sasori and deidara both prefer war. let's not bicker about this. hey, guys. you owe me later. so. who're we fighting. one nation.a small one. and what's special about this small nation. the political standing of a small nation changes all the time. anyway, the request comes from a large nation who wants its territory. interesting. that's the nation's castle. kidnap the young lord, huh. the problem is keeping it a secret. we're supposed to find a way with shikamaru's shadow possession or ino's mind transfer jutsu. nope. you and choji are the key players in this mission. us. yeah. choji, you're entering a contest attended by the lord. normally, unauthorized persons can't enter the castle. but participants will be allowed in. a contest being attended by the lord is like. why do i have to take part in it.. choji's gonna lose right away. no, it's food fight. what. a food fight. you should be happy, choji. simply put, it's an eating contest. no kidding, shikamaru.. being a contestant in an eating contest is a mission made in heaven. and what am i supposed to do. well, while choji creates a diversion, you will sneak into the castle, use your specialty transformation jutsu. to switch places with the young lord and buy us time while we make our escape with the real one. you're okay with naruto as the young lord. what's that supposed to mean.. exactly that. she's right. he's gonna be a young lord. if he says he wants ramen for lunch, his cover will be blown right away. aw listen, guys. and watch how you speak. aw man, you don't have to tell me.  do you really get it.  of course, i do. preliminary site participants, step forward. let's go. yeah. in hopes of prosperity for this nation and an abundance of crops. we will begin the contest. the winner will be duly honored by the lord and shall receive a generous reward. so everyone, do your best. and partake of the foods with dignity and grace. the preliminaries will be easy for choji.  but why naruto.  ramen, ramen.  there's an event featuring ramen.  ramen, ramen. other than ramen, he's like everyone else. yeah, well. for the first event.. bean jam cakes. huh.. not ramen.. from the wellknown amaama an in the castle town. on your mark. eat your fill. naruto can't cut it, after all. ino, over there. huh. that's them. yeah. that's the young lord in question. never mind them. look at him. huh. that big guy. this nation hires former samurai as guards. he's the captain of the guards. and the biggest threat to our operation. time. are you okay, naruto. maybe not. contestants who were unable to finish must withdraw. i barely made it through. we continue on to the second round. a second round now.. the second round is. a rameneating contest. ramen. right after this.. ramen from the famous castle town shop, gito gito tei. look at the size of this. pace yourselves. ttasty, but. this greasiness right now. ttasty, but.these voluminous thick noodles right now. the roast pork is amazing and they're generous with the broth. i can't.  even though it tastes so good.  it's a deluxe fishcake too. i can't. i can't take another bite. i want to, but i can't. if i eat any more. i'll be in trouble. and yet, i want to eat. but i can't. everyone seems up to the task. hmm. father, watching them has made me hungry. how about some of those bean jam cakes from earlier. someone. what about you, lord shu. i'd like to try that ramen. oh, not ramen. why not. it's lukewarm and the noodles are too soft. the taster must check my lord's food for poison, so the noodles always get soft. bean jam cakes are wonderful. they stay the same. is that so. how unfortunate. lord shu, it's almost time. huh. but there's a contest today. that doesn't matter. now, let us go. all right. everyone is amazing. thirty seconds left. seems choji's sussed out his rivals. five seconds left. four.three.two.one. zero. stop eating. the final round will be held at sunset. only those who have finished their bowls will be allowed inside the castle. yes. choji. do your best. just leave it to me. okay, the groundwork is laid. how about we go get some lunch. watch your side. always keep moving. yes, keep your eyes on your opponent. don't step straight back. i can't move anymore. it's not over. what's the point of training anyway. i'm a hostage. all i have to do is behave. fate is unpredictable. mine.won't change. tatewaki. i see that you can move. your training is too harsh. that's all for today. are you all right, lord shu. tatewaki doesn't like me. he's just being dutiful. after all, he's a samurai. a former samurai. chosen ones. i commend you for making it to the finals. no need to be reserved. eat your fill. all right. win this thing, choji.  he can't win.  huh. why not. we want him to come in second. that's the strategy for the young lord's escape. i see. the first of the final events is a speedeating contest. of 100 pieces of sushi. the top three contestants will advance to the final. these are from the renowned neta neta sushi in the castle town. eat wisely.  okay, let's get going, naruto.  right.  ino.  i know. ninja art. mind transfer jutsu. lord shu. i'm going to the washroom. oh my, what a fine group we have this year. so this is the young lord. make it snappy. transformation jutsu. okay, i'm off. lord shu, this is a missive from your father. and you are. i am a shinobi, and i'm here at the request of your homeland. finished. finished. choji's still eating. clean your plates. and stop. we will take a short break, then the top three will go on to the final. oh man, that was good. choji, do you really know what you're supposed to do. sushi is wonderful too. it doesn't get soft. lord shu, have some sushi. nah, i. i mean, i have no appetite. how unfortunate. is something the matter. it's nothing. i'm just shocked at how much everyone can eat. the last event is.bbq meat. barbecue.. from the renowned castle town shop. kemu kemuen. eat with care. did it work. well, for now. oh. if it's barbecue, it'll be easy for choji. well, not really. huh. oh my. how amazing. damn. well then, i'll use my twohanded style. oh look. she's eating with both hands. she's using a special technique. huh. then get a load of this. lethal juggler. oh, he's using two hands too. no, he's using his left hand to put the meat on the grill, and using his right hand to eat the cooked meat. going ambidextrous means he wastes no time. however. i can't see his chopsticks. so fast. at this rate, choji will win. sheesh, he needs to come in second or it won't work. this is. this is the last. .the last. the last bite. ii can't move. finished. shadow possession jutsu, successful. stop eating. the winner of this year's food contest is. isono. i did it. oh boy. well done. all of you are to be commended. i lost. can't be helped. you slowed down at the very end. you shall be rewarded. the winner, isono, is awarded a house. secondplace choji is awarded a large wicker basket. and thirdplace tamao is awarded a small wicker basket. and with that, i declare the food contest over. wasn't that fun, lord shu. yyes. now i'm starting to get hungry. what a tiny nation. why don't we take care of this quick with my art. deidara, your job ends here. what. i'll take care of the rest. that's not fair. our objective here is not to destroy the nation, but to take it over. next time on naruto shippuden: "the fallen castle" you can just sit back, relax and observe. the fallen castle tune in again. )
