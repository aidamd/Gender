everyone the seal will be complete very shortly. maintain your focus until it's over. right. right. what is that.. tenten. there's a monster behind us. huh.. huh.. what is that.. kakashi senpai. is that. what a persistent bunch. it's my turn to pay them back for earlier. lee, physical attacks won't work on that slime. neither will my insects cripes, what a nuisance. perhaps it's better to leave them to the two jonin i wonder if this is what you'd call "gross". we'll torment you. we'll torment you. huh.. they sure aregross. shattered promise what happened to rinji.. rinji became part of my collection, long ago. what.. he was such a nuisance continueeh. i'd be happy to be the one reporting to lord orochimaru you. i've done many things for you as your spy. lord orochimaru doesn't need anyone besides me to serve him. damn it. so it's all going as you planned yes lord orochimaru is an amazing man. everything has gone as he predicted. guren and yuukimaru's hearts have become linked so strongly that they trust each other to be the place to return to. now, if this close bond is shattered by their fatal relations yuukimaru's anger will release an explosive force. that was supposed to be the case however, even when he learned that guren killed his mother yuukimaru's anger did not explode. why. why is that.. the human heart is such a strange thing, isn't it. youare unforgivable. what the hell are you doing with guren and yuukimaru's feelings.. you don't play with people's feelings. just what are you guys aiming to do.. it's not only the hidden leaf and the akatsuki but all the hidden villages will soon engage in long, fierce clashes. lord orochimaru has his eyes on that violent future that was the reason for the threetailsfor yuukimaru. that's all gibberish to me. guren. go with yuukimaru. show me you can protect him. i will. i'll protect him with my life. i won't let you pass. i'm gonna kick your butt. dead soul jutsu. guren rinji. i promise i'll protect you. i will not fail. guren. crystal style: crimson fruit. guren. don't worry. i'll be right back, so you wait here. huh.. wait here. i will come back for you no matter what. don't go. guren, you're the only one i have to return to. do not worry. i won't die. what.. it's useless. crystals are formed when identical polyhedrons are aligned in a uniform pattern. i can stop the crystals from forming by vibrating the air with the bats' ultrasonic waves. yes your crystal style was never a threat to me. didn't i tell you it's useless. you're troublesome even when you're dead. after guren, it's youyuukimaru. huh.. no you don't. i will protect yuukimaru with my life. guren. your crystal style won't work anymore. nothing works against the dead. now you can't manipulate your bats, can you. crystal style. what.. return to the underworld quietly. guren. no. don't go. the jutsu is broken. thatcan't be. you said you'd you said you'd protect yuukimaru. yuukimaru. the threetails will be getting tired soon then we'll finish it at once. what.. where is the threetails finding this kind of strength. i'm not sure, but it seems his chakra suddenly increased. yamato, use your wood style to restrain it. i will deliver the finishing blow. right. kakashi senpai. yeah. find the sealing team and rescue them. right. right. threetails. the moment he lost guren, with whom he shared a strong bond the latent power in yuukimaru was released. to think that the sadness of losing the place he should return to would be so great yuukimaru. stop. huh.. yuukimaru. can you hear me, yuukimaru.. it's me. naruto. please notice me. yuukimaru. damn it. calm down. yuukimaru kill them all. destroy them. i'll have to stop it. multi shadow clone jutsu. let's do it. damn it. my rasengan doesn't work. and yet, i can't use the wind style: rasen shuriken. but what i can do summoning jutsu. bro. that's the threetails, right. it seems things have gotten out of hand. i wouldn't call you guys otherwise. gamatatsu, get ready for the toad water pistol. right. wait, gamatatsu. huh. what is it.. we're in a hurry here. think hard. the opponent is a turtlelike beast that lives in the lake. even if you increase the power with the wind style, what will be the effect of using the toad water pistol, which is a water style justu. to beat a water style, you need the earth style. if we keep stalling, the terrain around here will change. i only have the wind style so we have no choice. wind style.. so i'm a good match with sasuke, huh. yes, only wind can defeat lightning. no, that's not what i meant. i mean only the power of wind can help fire by making it an even larger power. fire style. what about the fire style. if we had fire style, my wind could i can use it. huh.. you can use fire style.. yeah, i can. why didn't you say that sooner.. you didn't ask. and. what about the fire style. oh, fire style. what is it. damn it. i thought it was a good idea so just tell me what's going on. no i thought we could help the "fire" and make it stronger with my wind. but fire is weak against water. i see. if the water style is stronger than the fire, we'll create an even stronger fire, which will make the water evaporate. huh.. hey, gamatatsu. what is it, bro. go back to the village and drink all the toad oil you can. okay. you have one minute. i will summon you back in one minute. gotcha. i get it. if you use oil instead of water to fire the toad water pistol, the oil will spread everywhere then you'll set the oil on fire with your fire style. that's right. we can use the same timing as the toad water pistol and we won't need to practice first. all right. this'll work. guren that promise you couldn't keep i swear i'll keep it for you. naruto. it's one minute. summoning jutsu. did you have enough time. uhhuh. just about. mmm, we're ready, naruto. yeah. all right. we'll use this new collaboration jutsu and burn off its face. its weak point is the eyes. all right, are we set.. it's doordie. failure is not an option. right, bro. let's do it, gamatatsu. okay. collaboration jutsu. wind style: toad flame bombs. now. we did it. it worked, bro. yeah you did a good job. looks like it's over for now. well then, we'll be going. yeah thanks. see you. let's go home together. i'm sorry. it was not part of my plan to have the hidden leaf interfere. so, is guren dead. unfortunately. she had an interesting ability you don't mean it. you're just saying that. and about yuukimaru leave it. it doesn't matter once i have his body next time: "a place to return to" tune in again. )
