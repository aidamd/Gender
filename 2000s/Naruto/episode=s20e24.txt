it's over. sasuke, come back to the village. can't we start over and be friends. yeah, i'll return to the leaf village. but don't get the wrong idea. huh.. i have no intention of joining up with you guys. i'm going to change the shinobi world in my own way. jiraiya ninja scrolls: the tale of naruto the hero rival my feelings won't change. just what are you. i'm your friend. so that's why i'm saying i'm never gonna let orochimaru have you. i'm taking you back as a friend. i'm going to take you down. that's all i've ever thought about. c'mon, naruto. i'm not gonna lose. fire style: fireball jutsu. fireball jutsu. ever since the ninetails incident, we uchiha have lived under suspicion. we're forced to live on the outskirts of the village. and looked upon with distrust. if things continue like this negotiations with the village are ongoing. if we are diligent in fulfilling our duties, we are sure to get a positive response. there are volatile youths among us. ones who cannot stand the fourth hokage and would rather. watch your tongue. the hokage. i first met you at the academy entrance ceremony. so what about it. it's been destined that this would happen, since then. you're sasuke of the uchiha clan. will you be friends with my son, naruto. oh, lord hokage. let's see. rather than a friend. my sasuke will grow up to be a fine rival for your son. this is.the hokage's kid. at the academy, as the son of the head of the uchiha i remember itachi when he entered. you are definitely his brother. i was constantly compared to my big brother. even when i thought the pressure would crush me. i was determined never to lose to you, the hokage's son. in the end, i was ranked at the top. while you were the loser. but, rather than feeling superior, i was annoyed. how could someone like you be the hokage's son. you could never be my rival. how would i know. you're talking about stuff from a long time ago. however. that day. my dog. someone. someone, please save him. it's too dangerous. don't go. but. if you try to save it, you'll be swept away by the currents too. there.there.you're safe now. i was so mad at myself. i stood by the river and couldn't move. but you didn't even think about living or dying. you just jumped in and saved the puppy. my body just moved.  it wasn't a big deal.  don't say that. i wasn't able to act. but you did, without any hesitation. that made me so mad. then a while after that. the dissatisfaction among the uchiha reached its peak, almost to the verge of revolt. there's no need to dirty your hands any more. with the joining of the uchiha and senju, which was never thought possible. peace has been preserved within the village hidden in the leaves. and it will last beyond this night. long into the future. the fourth hokage brilliantly averted an uchiha coup d'tat through negotiation. my opinion towards both the hokage and you changed completely. sasuke. you aren't just a loser. you possess something i don't have. i felt we could become real rivals. but youdidn't change one bit. you stayed a loser, always laughing foolishly and i ended up acknowledging you. but you. that's not my fault. i've tried hard to do something about it. i wanted to grow strong with you. fighting.honing our skills together. that's what i wanted. but all of a sudden, you. multi shadow clone jutsu. naruto.. here i come. rasengan. naruto. you left me behind all alone and got better. that's why i desperately tried to keep up. chidori stream. i obtained power from orochimaru. and surpassed even him. and yet, you keep progressing and advancing further away from me. i don't care about catching up to you anymore. i'm going to take you down right now. you'll never get ahead of me ever again. i'll show you who's on top right here and right now. how's that. it's not enough. i've still got my clones, ya know. that's. it's sage mode. sage art: giant rasengan. i'm not done yet. shadow clone jutsu. sage art: rasen shuriken. not yet. it's still not enough. i was able to aim for my best. because of you. i was able to get this far because i thought of you.as my rival. you make me sick. don't underestimate the uchiha no, me. i'm gonna surpass you. he's serious. he's dead set on destroying you. can you lend me some power. sasuke's power is awesome. i got it. use my power. demon fox. uh, i mean what's your name. seal my real name iskurama. kurama.thank you. those black flames are. naruto, use your tailed beast bomb. huh. what's that. it's the same as the rasengan. i'm going to bring this destiny between us to an end. naruto. i'm going to take you down. just try, sasuke. as your friend, i'll stop you. naruto. sasuke. you have always been, and will always be. my friend. you're my friend, ya know that. that hurt.you idiot. a punch from a friend should hurt. you could always jump into action radiantly, in any situation. seeing you do that was so blinding. sasuke. i was so jealous of you. that's all it was. then that's what friends are. and so, the child of prophecy, naruto uzumaki, would become the hokage, and with his friends, forge through thick and thin towards a bright future for the shinobi. thus ends the "jiraiya ninja scrolls: the tale of naruto the hero, part one. " so naruto becomes the hokage. talk about playing favorites but those two, eh.. right. it's not a bad ending, is it. well. i guess you could say that. tsunade. tsunade. you're so loud. i read it all, didn't i. jjiraiya. tsunade what were you reading. hey, where's jiraiya's book. i don't know. i finished reading his novel and. you're still halfasleep, aren't you. there's still some time before we leave for the five kage summit. why don't you sleep a little bit longer. i'm tired of dreaming.
