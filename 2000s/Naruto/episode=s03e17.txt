oh no. it's his third tail resonance sora sora. naruto. look out. naruto. naruto. damn it. is he okay. i can't believe sora's consciousness i can't believe sora's not in there give me a break. sora has flipped at last. nobody can stop him now. kazuma you jerk. wood style jutsu. such destructive force. stop it, sora. shadow strangle jutsu. i knew it wouldn't work. let me try. choji. leave it to me. i'll heal him. damn it. for crying out loud, wake up. kazuma why did you do this.. you are his real father why.. you implanted the ninetails in sora in order to use him as a tool for killing. do you know what that means. it's all for my will i will put him to good use for my dream. knock it off. i'll go. jerk. fang over fang. damn it. you no longer have a cause left to speak of. my dream is to make sure the land of fire stays as it is. there's nothing wrong with that. then what about your child's sora's dreams. what was your dream as the son of the third hokage. i i protected the king. and you did, too. isn't that good enough. indeed i'm protecting a king but it's not the king you've got in mind. there you go. it's the same with you, too. it doesn't matter who the king is. when all is said and done, we're just pawns and all we can do is protect the king. but a pawn isn't strong enough to protect a king. that's why i turned sora into what he is. a monster pawn that has advanced into enemy territory to take out your king. children aren't pawns for protecting a king. that doesn't make any difference. as long as we're pieces, all we can do is take the other's king. how it's done isn't important. even if you somehow turned the board around i'd still win. wood style jutsu. damn it why side with an outsider.. he's not an outsider. he's a member of team kakashi. he's one of us sora. hey. remember, sora. back then, you acted like an idiot and i tried to stop you from thrashing about like this. i guess there's no choice. did he get him.. naruto. sora. sora. come back. i know you're in there, sora. sora. sora. stop, already. get away from sora naruto. sora. hey, sora. come back. sora. sora. you what.. huh.. whwhat's going on here. the ninetails chakra, by itself.. now. stabilize hokage style: elder jutsu. what's happening here. it's never like this. it's comingfrom the outside naruto. damn it don't come out. why.. coincidence sure plays funny tricks on you. fouka said that. furido about that kid with the pointy hair i fought against i wonder if he might kind of be like sora somehow she said he and sora might be connected. it's the chakra from the same ninetails after all. the rage of sora's ninetails is resonating with the real ninetails. what.. isn't this interesting.. now the true jinchuriki no, the ninetailed monster fox will be set in motion and once again destroy the village. damn it. damn it. don't do this. stop, sora. sora. ddon't tell me. whwhat's that.. this is not good. run, guys. naruto. sakura. sora. wake up. hey. that's the way, sora. smash the hidden leaf to pieces. no way sora naruto.. heck no. no way am i going to let the ninetails jerk take me over. what's that.. very nice. keep it up, sora. i didn't call you. beat it, monster fox. don't just show up on your own. captain yamato, can't something be done about this.. no. my jutsu won't work on naruto now. we can only have faith in his mental strength. but. damn it. leave it to meboy. i refuse. i won't run away. i won't be overtaken by the likes of a monster fox. naruto naruto damn it. i made a vow i will notbetaken over by you anymore. i must not do the same thing i lectured sora about why do you hesitate. just say it like always. say, "loan me your power. " knock it off. sora, i'll get you back with my own hands. naruto sora who's that. sora. come back. get back here. are you going to sleep forever. wake up, already. wake up. sora. who's that. who's there. oh, it's me when i was little i was always crying i was all alone. sora who. whose voice is that. sora i knew it just as i thought nothing's changed. i'm stillalone sora hang on. i'll save you now. hang on, sora. whose voice is that. sakura. i can't heal choji's wound with my medical ninjutsu just as i thought it's like the time when sakura got hurt. it takes longer for wounds inflicted by ninetails chakra to heal huh. even after proper treatment a sharp needlelike pain will linger on the wound. so what then.. does that mean naruto's the only one who can control him.. unfortunately, that would seem to be the case. no way all we can do is believe in naruto next time: "my friend" )
