get back, naruto. he's on our side. uh, okay. ouch, ouch, ouch. watch out. it's a special barrier jutsu made to bind tailed beasts. weeee. lariat. awesome. how did you do that just now. can you teach it to me. we have to hurry out of this village. what. what about my ramen. you can eat some somewhere else. i want ichiraku's miso and char siu ramen. i won't let you get away. are you okay. ouch. this is. we're probably underground somewhere within the leaf village. you think this is where the foundation was. you've got guts, trying to steal the leaf's jinchuriki. it's the hokage. granny tsunade. furthermore, you're jinchuriki too. tailed beasts that flew right into the flame. do you want to become the leaf's jinchuriki too, jinchuriki of the sand, and friends. i won't let that happen. hey, what's wrong. no bra. nah, she's fooling you. she's an old lady, y'know. how come you're so tense, octopops. hey. what're you focusing on, bee.. we'll settle it with this. lady tsunade. you can't be serious.. we're dealing with three jinchuriki. we can't have them ravaging the village. okay, odds or evens, a single round. if i lose, you're free to go anywhere you like. lady tsunade. if that's the case, let me do this. stay out of this, shizune. don't spoil my fun. i mean, this is the hokage's job. but your gambling skills aren't. i would like to. check the dice. be my guest. shukaku. you got it. they're good. lady tsunade, did you just see.. shut up, shizune. fine. let's begin. well then. hhey.you're shaking it too much. okay, place your bet. odd or even. even. it's even, okay. and i'm odd. the bets are placed. and the winner is. it's.snake eyes. i feel sick. what's going on with this raccoon dog. that's cheating. why you. why don't you. take this. hey, octopops. bra. get yourself together. this way. stop. made it. that went well. how.. we got the nine tails jinchuriki without a scratch. we worked together, now we're pals. ramen. ichiraku ramen. gimme a fist bump. lemme eat ramen. hey, you've got some potential. gimme a fist bump. lemme eat ramen. we're friends, me and you. menma and char siu. let's cooperate and help each other add an extra egg to my order. we're jinchuriki, and we should be pals, each and every one of us. but now, we're far apart and feeling suspicious so you're planning to find the rest of us. that's the plan for now. let's go. i wanted to settle this amicably, but there's nothing more to say. use force if you have to. just bring naruto back before he crosses the border. what should we do about the cloud and sand's jinchuriki. i won't ask the impossible and ask you to capture them. we are talking about jinchuriki here. capturing three at the same time is damn near impossible. the priority is capturing naruto. the jinchuriki are traveling northwest. i believe they're headed for the hidden waterfall. go.  right.  right. the tailed beast's power isn't at 100% right now. do you know why. because most of the power was stolen. yes. that's why if every tailed beast goes at full power, chakra will be used up in no time. stolen. by whom. the akatsuki. akatsuki. they plan to use the power of the tailed beasts to change the world. there's a princess who is trying to oppose the akatsuki. so we're gonna protect her and take back the tailed beast's power. where is she. in a certain castle. but first, we have to gather our comrades. all nine jinchuriki. they're sure to make their move during the next full moon. so by then. we should avoid all known paths and highways. right. oh. just wait a minute. look. what about a tea stand at the mountain ridge. it's not a tea stand. it's a ramen stand. ichiraku on the mountain pass world famous sansai ramen control yourself until we get to the hidden waterfall. the hidden waterfall doesn't have a single shop listed on the map of nationwide ramen shops. let's get a move on. before they catch up, we have to be gone. aw man. it looks like they're already here. instead of scrambling, why don't just hunker down and prepare for them here. so tasty. this is so good. i pity anyone who hasn't tasted ramen this good. wood style. please don't resist. we only have business with naruto. i don't want your business. a shadow clone.. sand. an octopus leg. acrobat. are you okay. let's do this. use my chakra. i won't let you. weee. yugao. wee. why you. everyone, get back. roar, strong arm. wood style. domed wall. where did they go. they got away. or rather, they retreated. yeah, but i doubt if they've given up. is once the limit for tailed beast lariat. it seems so. sorry, bee. no worries, eighto. c'mon, let's go. i guess this isn't the time to be eating, after all. of course not. one jinchuriki is hard enough, but with three of them joined together, ordinary means won't work. but at least it's clear right now that the tailed beasts can't release their original power. it seems their chakra runs out right away. i attached a transmitter on them, so we'll track them and wait for reinforcements. we're okay, captain yamato. let's go. the tailed beasts may have run out of chakra, but we're still dealing with gaara of the sand and the cloud's killer bee. we can't make any mistakes from here on. and. hidden waterfall village is just as i expected, the scenery is amazing. but octopops. what do we do now. we don't even know what the seven tails jinchuriki looks like, right. it's sure to work out quick. jinchuriki are fans of arithmetic. i hate arithmetic. and stop talking nonsense. be careful, bee. i sense something ominous coming our way. naruto. gaara. that guy's itachi. akatsuki. that's them. each member in the akatsuki has a unique ninjutsu. what's more, itachi possesses the sharingan and can put tailed beasts under genjutsu. do not look directly into his eyes. we have learned that jinchuriki have joined together and are behaving suspiciously. and we, the akatsuki, cannot overlook that. fool, ya fool. you stole our line. what about that akatsuki, what's your design. you guys want to tangle with us. i'll take that one. it's an even three versus three. yeah. that's perfect. hold your horses, you guys. we jinchuriki, get into formation, dance in joint collaboration. naruto. i'll take care of that one. looks like i get to take you on. for some reason, i really want to take you down. i'll beat you at your own game, hmm. not if i can help it. itachi. sasuke left the village to go after you. what are you gonna do.. wake up, naruto. it's a genjutsu. we don't want a brawl we just want safety for us all. acrobat. for jinchuriki. yearlong security. gimme a fist bump. just hearing that we're jinchuriki makes people hate us and detest us. that's our fate as jinchuriki. fool ya fool. then we're just gonna have to bust through that fate, right. we're the same jinchuriki as you. next time on naruto shippuden: "killer bee rappuden: part 2" i won't fear. i won't hate. i won't detest. killer bee rappuden: part 2 tune in again. )
