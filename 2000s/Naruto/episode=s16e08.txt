a shinobi of the leaf stand up. we're leaving. what about the mission, kakashi. our mission is to search this location. it's suspended, because of you. don't let me stop you. you're trying to kill me, so stop joking around. i'm not joking around. move. i hear foundation agents are all trained to discard their emotions. does the same go for you. not just our emotions. shinobi of the foundation have no names, no past, no future. we have only our missions. well, you failed your mission. don't move. snakes. what are they. that one too. they're not ordinary snakes. they're orochimaru's experiments. what.. kinoe. kinoe. dead. everyone's dead. i'm going to die too. in here, like this. are you alive. are you all right, kinoe.. are you all right. i think so. but why. why did you save me. i couldn't just let you die. but even if you did, i would have deserved it. did you.want to die. no, i didn't. i.did not want to die. then be thankful that you're alive. that.i'm alive. the fluid from the snake. this is. don't inhale. it's poisonous. run. rright. kakashi. i didn't encounter orochimaru. nor did i encounter a strange clan. nor someone from the foundation. i can only live by the rules. but that's okay. i know now that i'm capable of protecting someone. get me a replacement for this right eye of mine. kinoe, where's kakashi. you did it. so you didn't need me. i made it appear like he was killed by orochimaru's trap. lord hokage's anbu will probably find him. good. let's return before they get wind of us. kinoe. to kakashi. i've become confused about this mission, where i'm supposed to kill a friend. so i'm going to abandon this mission, and i will report to lord danzo that i failed. please take care. kinoe.. kakashi senpai, we have to tend to your wounds. i must report in first. hmm. what's the matter. lord third. regarding the foundation's wood style user. he targeted me. lord danzo ordered it. but he dropped his mission midway and saved my life. he then returned to the village. but who knows what's happened to him by now. wwhat is the meaning of this, kinoe. i beg your pardon. i failed my mission. if kakashi beat you, then it's my fault for underestimating kakashi's strength. however, you abandoned your mission and did a poor job of faking his death, and then returned here. and i sent two men to do the job. what was your intention. answer me. why did you do this. please go to lord danzo and save kinoe. lord third. it's agreed upon that i don't interfere with the foundation. however, that is not possible in this case. yugao. sir. take this missive to foundation headquarters. it's an order from the hokage. summon danzo here immediately. yes, sir. i'm counting on you, yugao. please rest assured, my lord. kakashi. sir. go to the infirmary and tend to your wounds. yes, sir. senpai.. i'm coming with you. kakashi is a shinobi of the leaf. he is a leaf comrade. is it right to kill a friend. consider only those in the foundation your friends. isn't the foundation a friend of the hidden leaf. the foundation is a unique organization that supports the large tree known as the leaf, from deep underground. just as a tree is divided into what is above and below ground, the foundation has its own existence. kinoto. what is a foundation shinobi. shinobi of the foundation have no names. no emotion. no past. no future. we have only our missions. as the leader of the foundation, my missions are absolute. no future. no past. no emotion. no name. welcome back, tenzo. are you listening, kinoe.. no. my name is not kinoe. what are you saying. you are kinoe of the foundation. what other name could you have besides that temporary one. i am a shinobi of the leaf. not just of the foundation. a shinobi of the hidden leaf, which has a trunk and branches. everyone is my comrade. damn you. what made you turn on us.. take him to the treatment room. bind him with a curse mark. lord third has summoned lord danzo. notify him that he is to appear immediately. summon lord danzo is not here. what. we will let him know as soon as he returns. where is he now. we do not know. we aren't privy to lord danzo's schedule. go back and report this to lord third. what about you. i'll stay here and wait for him. go. stop. you are under foundation jurisdiction. where is kinoe. damn kinoe. what crazy thoughts did kakashi put in his head. lord danzo, we're ready. release. let's get out of here. kakashi.. kinoe. wood style. hey, wait. found him. over there. wind style: vacuum bullets. wood style: domed wall. how good of you to come over from your side, kakashi. you entered foundation jurisdiction without authorization and tried to take one of our own. don't think you'll get off so easily. lord danzo, kakashi is. silence. and you won't get away with this either. neither shall you. hiruzen. i know that you bear a grudge against kakashi. but that's no cause to target one of our best shinobi. what are you talking about, hiruzen. i could care less about kakashi. however, he trespassed by his own accord, into foundation territory and that is serious. "by his own accord". no, i dispatched him with a summons from me. then he went looking for you. on my orders. there must've been a communication mixup. i'm hearing that for the first time. well then, that settles it with kakashi. it's regarding this next issue that i sent for you. it's regarding another superior shinobi of this village. you know that the wood style user has long been desired in hidden leaf village. there even was a period when we conducted tests to acquire that power. now i understand there is such a wood style user. why would you keep him hidden within the foundation. i found him. and i protected and raised him. it's not like i was hiding him. i just felt there was no need to report it to you. listen, danzo. the jinchuriki child is now four years old. the wood style sealing jutsu is becoming more and more crucial to the village. so. will you entrust this user to me. i'll assign him to the anbu under my direct control. but. please, danzo. i know he is a valuable subordinate to you. but for the sake of the hidden leaf, transfer him to me. then all will be settled amicably. members of the foundation have a curse mark, so they do not reveal topsecret intel. i will not remove the curse mark. that is fine. all right then. i now receive him into my care. henceforth, you will be an anbu under my direct orders. umm. thank you for everything. hhello. i just transferred here from the foundation. i'm kinoe. hey, tenzo. tenzo. kinoe was your codename in the foundation. in the anbu, you should call yourself tenzo. but that name is. didn't you call yourself tenzo in the past. all right, everyone. this is tenzo, the newbie. i can vouch for his skill. nice to meet you. welcome.  nice to meet you, tenzo.  i expect good things from you. tenzo.huh. tenzo, you're on my team. team ro. i'm counting on you. okay, senpai. as usual, your lightning blade is as brilliant as ever, senpai. there's no such thing as brilliant or unsightly in assassination killing is just killing. which reminds me, what happened to the replacement for the vacancy on our team. i'm in no rush. we're not in the middle of a war or anything. next time on naruto shippuden: "an uchiha anbu" sooner or later, someone will show up. an uchiha anbu tune in again. )
