you want to master a new jutsu right now. that's impossible. i don't care. i have to do it. all right. these will be somewhat harsh measures, but let's try. ohh. do you have any ideas. youget into gamatatsu's mouth. what about us. the enemy already knows about us. they could take action at any moment. it's possible they'd leave to avoid wasting time contacting us or provoking a fight in either case, our mission is to capture the enemy and obtain information. if we lose track of the enemy, they may pose a threat to the hidden leaf later. we'll keep searching for the enemy. listen, guys. lord orochimaru gave us an important mission. that is, we're responsible for delivering him safely to the lake. we can't afford to fail. buti know some strangers are following us from the hideout. that's just what i'd expect from you, guren. you're already aware of them. currently three people and one dog are a couple of kilometers away, and they're slowly heading towards us. what should we do. i know just the thing. i don't want them to follow us anymore. find them. i'll defeat them here. the unseeing enemy all right. i kind of feel like i can do it. that's the spirit, naruto. all right. gamatatsu, one more time. all right i feel it gamatatsu's chakra. when he stores it up and spits it out naruto, are you all right.. i think i just got some sort of clue. i see. things have gotten interesting all right. i've got to practice while the sensation's still fresh naruto. huh. huh. oh. sakura. come on. don't waste your time here. you smell terrible. anyway, why are you so sticky and worn out.. well, umm, this is this is really important anyway, everyone's tired of waiting for you. wwait a second, sakura. i need to practice right now. no excuses. gamakichi, gamatatsu i'll call you again. huh. sure. work hard. big brother, can i clean out my mouth. i sense him. this is a ninja's chakra. look out. so you're their leader. kakashi sensei. sensei. don't, kiba. what.. i missed. but since gozu is taking care of their boss, it looks like things will be easy. you've got quite the tracking ability it really is unfortunate. could it be is it them. yeah. probably they were in that hideout. be careful, okay. okay, we're against three people. what should we do, kiba. akamaru and my jutsu are linked. we've got to defeat one of them first and reduce their numbers. and after that. it would be good if we could defeat them by ourselves, but it'll be best if we can prolong the battle until kakashi sensei comes. okay. we need to go after one of the two in front but from what i can see, we should avoid that masked guy. he looks like he's hiding something. which means let's go, akamaru. fang over fang. kigiri, smoke screen. kiba. crap. poison mist.. i see. thank you, akamaru. but does the fact that it's not poisonous mean that it's just a diversion. what.. what's this.. the smells around medisappeared. i see. they use this to erase traces of their movements this is bad aside from the fact that i can't see, i can't smell anything either wait. it should be the same for our enemies as well. so how do they know exactly where i am.. go, nurari. they're going to get me. duck. hinata.. stand back, kiba. i'll handle this be careful, hinata. i'm not sure how, but they can move freely in this smoke. it's all right. even if they take away my sense of sight and smell, they cannot take away my byakugan. all right. stand back, akamaru. i'm your opponent what.. could it be that even in this smoke screen. that's right. i can see all of your attacks. right here. just kidding. it can't be. i missed.. that's impossible. but how.. what's this. what strength. die. a shadow clone correct. i can't fight someone as dangerous as you right away. you've enhanced your muscles to their limit. did orochimaru do that for you. even if you run away, you can't defeat me. from what i can see, your weapons are your speed and your strength. you've got destructive power, but i specialize in predicting movements. it's pointless to resist. come to the village with me. i refuse. it looks like it's begun first, i need to see how skilled my enemies and allies are. i should take action as well how unfortunate. even though you can see me, it's pointless. something's surrounding his body that's why he's not affected, no matter how much chakra i hit him with it seems that you use the gentle fist. i'm a bad match for you. do you want that boy to help you. no. if i call kiba, it'll be just what he wants hinata. hinata. crap. isn't there something i can do.. this just might work. let's go, akamaru. over here. he's even faster than before but his attacks are straightforward. they're easy to read. what.. will i make it.. finish her off, nurari. understood. whwhat's this.. once more. fang over fang. kkiba. what is this.. hinata. sorry i'm late. hhey, are you all right. kiba, how did you find me. well, i used the spin of my fang over fang to stir the air around me. once the air circulation improved, that annoying smoke cleared up. with my sense of sight and smell back, we've got the advantage. you may have done whatever you wanted before, but prepare yourselves. are you sure we're the ones who should prepare ourselves. crap. others were waiting to ambush us. too bad. well, now that we know all about you we're going to kill them with our next attack. understood. understood. what.. that's impossible this feeling. we're surrounded hey, bro.. kigiri, a smoke screen. retreat. what.. what the hell are they doing. it seems that the enemy has good senses as well. shino. how unfortunate i was just about to finish casting a net around them is everyone all right. kakashi sensei. we're all together. yeah. but hinata is how is it. can you move. yes, somewhat sensei, did you get that big guy. no i couldn't get him i see they got away from us too. then the battle's not over yet. there should be another jutsu user nearby oh. how interesting. i never expected my pursuer to be kakashi the copy ninja it may have been too much for gozu and rinji. my preparation went well. i guess it's my turn. mother say captain yamato are you sure we're closing in on kakashi sensei's team. if things are going according to plan, he should have left some sign. but i don't see anything like that here. geez. did they forget that we're following right behind them.. of course not. we should assume something happened to the search team. sai, do reconnaissance from the sky. i have a bad feeling about this. next time: "the labyrinth of distorted reflection. " it's good. hinata. what are you doing here. nnothing. a valentine's day chocolate. who are you giving it to. wwell but this isn't enough. listen well. valentine's day is a battle that's determined by the chocolate. leave this to me. lingzhi powder for nourishment. dragon turtle extract to relieve fatigue. and grated glutinous yam for healthy skin. complete. so anyway, here are some lovely chocolates. what do you mean, "so anyway". umm i was too afraid to give it to him ssorry. oh, wait. hinata. who couldn't she give this to. it's probably naruto. oh well. let's eat. what the heck is this.. )
