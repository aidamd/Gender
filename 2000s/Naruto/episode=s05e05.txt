all have to acknowledge you. gamatatsu, gamakichi, sakura, tsunadeand i we all admit you've worked really hard. i wonder what's pushing you forward. well, i never give up and i have guts. sasuke i wonder if sasuke will acknowledge that about me. i hope he does i can't tell him about the akatsuki hey, all of you. i have something to do, so i must leave. can you go back to the village and help with the rest of naruto's training. we'll take care of it. i'll do it if you give me some snacks. all right, all right. i'm counting on you. good luck, naruto. work hard and truly become the hokage naruto, good luck with your neversaydie spirit a new enemy. right. the enemy seems really hard to beat. i saw that the team was really flustered. therefore, you're giving this to me. there's something inside the crystal. it's shino's parasitic insect that was overcome by the enemy's jutsu. kakashi requested an analysis right away. this can't be i've only heard about it through rumors shizune, take this to the forensics team. it's urgent. all right. what.. the pervy sage disappeared.. yeah, he asked me to give this to you. please take care of snacks for gamatatsu. we're going back to our village. pack up. what's wrong. look i can see the valley where we stayed until now. lord orochimaru is waiting. let's go. oh, okay. do you smell something, akamaru. did you find anything, kiba. no, we haven't picked up any scents. i used byakugan, but couldn't see anything. oh. a bat. there are some signs. huh. where.. i'm talking about my insects. so don't get so excited. your insects. don't get me excited like that. well, you had tens of thousands of insects, so i wouldn't be surprised if one of them is still alive. but that one insect out of tens of thousands that managed to survive becomes an asset to us. . an asset to us. because it has survived despite incurring the enemy's jutsu. you mean the insects are now immune to the enemy's jutsu my insects' life span is only a few hours at most. and the immune insect can breed in a very short period. that's amazing. but it's just a possibility. i'm not sure if it'll be successful. anyway, i must find as many surviving insects as possible. we'll help you. yeah. count on us. there's no need. what.. only i can search for the insects. i can't have you stepping on them while you're searching around blindly. can't you refuse our help with a little more finesse. i don't want to waste time by being vague. that's fine. shino, you go find the insects that survived. and we'll continue our search. all right, let's go, akamaru. sorry, but i've had a series of snake eyes. hey bro, i hope you're not cheating. no way. i was born lucky, and i'm totally different from you. no wonder i'm losing. since your luck is so strong, let me roll the dice that you just used. she's late. shoot. almost. just one more roll. wanna try. it's a good way to kill time. you're ignoring me. fine. fine. but i'm a little surprised that you're waiting for guren to come back. you seemed defiant to me, so i thought you'd take advantage of this chance to escape. even if i could escape, i couldn't beat her. that's a surprising answer. i didn't know you had decided to obey guren. how about you guys. us. you knew from the beginning that a fight for survival would occur in that hideout. i thought you had already joined forces with them. you're sharp. that's right. but it's not surprising. it's better to have people who help each other in dangerous situations. so when times get desperate, we promise to help each other. those who overestimated their own abilities and acted thoughtlessly have died. so i say, our wisdom has helped us to survive. though, at the rate we were going in that battle royal, we might've fought each other. it's true that you were really strong out there all by yourself. while we were fighting individually, we had to keep away from you but we are four here. we won't be beaten if we stay together, not even by you. now we all work for guren you'd better socialize with the others. man, why couldn't they find a better hideout. guren isn't nice to us. she left us in this old shack. i'm going on patrol. did you find something. what's wrong, akamaru.. deliver this information quickly. i thought you were out on patrol. i had something to think about. i'm just setting out. i'll go with you. does that mean you're heeding my advice. a dog whistle. right. akamaru said he definitely heard it. do you think the enemy has a dog. i doubt it, because it's more difficult to remove dog odors than human odors. and if they have a dog, akamaru and i would've caught its scent long ago. thenwhy the dog whistle. i don't know. do you know which direction it came from. no, but i'm sure they're not far away. we've finally arrived first of all, i'm going to have ramen at ichiraku to refresh myself. then let's resume my training. brother naruto. huh. i guess you created a naughty technique at the hot springs during training, right. so, i'll do the new version of sexy jutsu. whoa. hey, konohamaru. ouch. so buying me one bowl of ramen is your way of apologizing for hitting me that hard. it's because you used that technique thoughtlessly, without caring about the time or place. summoning jutsu. oh. this is brother naruto's summoning. i can call for bigger guys, but these brats are enough for today. you called us brats. have you forgotten you're our dad's henchman. come on, please let me play cool in front of him today. then let's start training again. brother, i wonder what today's snack is. uhoh i'm looking forward to it. that's right. i completely forgot about the snacks. well, we'll have snacks after our training. what.. you don't have any snacks for us. brother, i'm going home. okay, okay. snack. snack. konohamaru, can you buy some snacks. got it. yahoo. snack. snack. i'll never have any money if i keep doing this. oh.. did you finish all your snacks already. oh. he's very skillful. how disgusting. listen, gamatatsu. if you help me train really well, pervy sage will give you more snacks than you can possibly eat. so let's work hard. yahoo. so. last time, we worked on how to find the right timing. so today, let's start where we left off. what's that. when you spit out the water, i find the right timing, and i pour in my chakra. there. i'll find the perfect timing, so you just shoot your water pistol. water pistol what's a water pistol. blast water out from your mouth using water style jutsu water style. what.. brother, i can't do that kind of thing. what are you talking about.. you're a frog, so it's easy for you to do water style. he's right. he can't do water style jutsu. you must be kidding. why have we trained together up until now.. even if you yell at him, he can't do something he doesn't know. then, gamakichi, you do it. why. can't you help us out. nno, i can't why not. come here for a bit. what. come here. what did you say. say what. because huh. i can't hear you. because it's water style jutsu you're irritating me. just speak clearly. i don't have skill for water style jutsu. what.. how did it go. find anything. no, nothing. i didn't find anything either. the weather is making it hard to track by scent. well, it's understandable in this pouring rain look, even the bats are taking cover from the rainwait. what's wrong, kiba. so that's the mystery behind that dog whistle. kakashi sensei, if that's the case, our movements may be detected by the enemy. next time: a night of rain. " why don't you like mr. gamariki. we haven't gotten along from the first time we met. mr. gamariki is a teacher of collaboration jutsu. nice to meet younaruto. what's the big idea.. all right, let's begin training. one heart, one body. use your hips. terrible. i'll punish you. cripes. this is ridiculous. there's no way i can endure this. are you giving up. it's not about being weak or whatever. quiet. you must not take the collaboration jutsu lightly. then get serious and train me properly. don't talk back. quiet. quiet. quiet. training. training. training. you're not ready for this training yet. i can't put up with this anymore. he's a really nice guy )
