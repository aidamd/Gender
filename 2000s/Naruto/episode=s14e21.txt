i didn't expect to lose this many of my pawns. furthermore, retrieving unique corpses turned out to be a failure. so then, what's my next move. summoning.reanimation jutsu. the second hokage originally developed it. but he sealed it away as a forbidden jutsu. that was such a waste, so i restored it. you became enamored by another's jutsu, lord orochimaru. it's very convenient, you know. naturally, i've made quite a few improvements from the second hokage's original jutsu. but there's still much i can do with it. and i must have more materials containing individual data. materials containing individual data. what do you mean. oh, like blood and flesh. from legendary shinobi. i've collected what i could, but. from now on, you can help me. we shall perfect this jutsu. i understand, lord orochimaru. maybe i'll stir things up on the battlefield. the reanimated allied forces are they.allies.. yes. hey. a sealed reanimation. yeah. that's toroi, the cloud's magnetstyle user. i'm amazed that just the two of you managed to seal him. no, actually. naruto came to help us. the famed shinobi who was being controlled by the reanimation. he must be turning in his grave. my dad went on a mission with toroi and was killed. huh. no kidding. the burden was probably too much for my dad. hey, look over there. a reanimated ninja. there's still another one. we have to seal him immediately. summoning jutsu. what the.. it's a huge ambush.. contact hq for reinforcements. rright. to think i'd have to resort to sending in you guys into the battlefield. our orders are to take back the reanimated ninja who have been sealed. don't order me around. i won't listen to a leaf ninja. enough. we are no longer part of the transient world. it's annoying, but we're all being controlled and under the same orders. i'm giving the orders. all units prepare to attack. who the hell are you. the red cloud of dust. daimaru of the wind. so you know me. i don't know you. you must've died before me. anyway. we're being controlled and there's nothing we can do about that. whether we kill or get killed, let's get it over with. i don't wanna die. stop the quibbling. all units, attack. we have the advantage in numbers. hhere they come. on guard. that's like an allied forcesized army of reanimated ninja. iif we come face to face with them. it's probably over for us. attack. hey, get back. don't come. stay away. hey, this is bad. they're.weak. maybe they're only genin. it's no good. it's no good. who said we had the advantage.. attack. sealing team, advance. we can do this. seal them. seal them. don't tell me those reanimations are. i reanimated a lot of them. but gathering individual data is hard work. you're literally looking for dead bodies. and you can't tell who they are when they're rotting. i had lots of failures. and they're the failures. the enemy's only strength is in numbers. we attack in one sweep. musai.. are you.musai.. don't tell me. dad.. huh.. your dad.. is he strong. you didn't get past chunin class, right, dad. you fool. say i was strong, even if you have to lie. there. they're coming this way. they're after toroi. what.. be careful, musai. our duty is. taking back my powerful pieces that i've lost. that's what you sacrificial pieces are for. wwhat happened.. this is.not right, kabuto. i agree, lord orochimaru. who the hell are you guys.. i'll ask just in case. you aren't the magnetstyle user toroi, are you. are you kidding me. i can't hold a candle to toroi. what shall we do, lord orochimaru. let's keep him for now. sorry, i can't disobey. as strange as it sounds, i'm going to rescue toroi. absolutely not. we'll protect him. over there. that's the reanimated force we got the report about. stay focused and attack. all right. reinforcements. is that.. no way. huh.. hey. it's me, bro. it's me. you. how come.. were you reanimated.. how's my family. my kids. they're all fine. they're doing well in the village. good. they're all okay. your wife remarried and she's happy. huh. she got remarried.. i guess that can't be helped. i hate to do this to my own kin, but i have to seal you. huh. hey. it's me. it's me. huh. what the hell.. why'd you let yourself get reanimated.. i couldn't say it until now. but i was wrong. forgive me. huh. oh well, forget it. it's all in the past and you're dead. you'll forgive me. i forgave you long ago. really.. dad, i'm sorry, but i have to seal you. wait. before that.. what is it. i fought alongside toroi until the very end. for the sake of the village. please make sure you tell lord raikage. all right, dad, i will. more reinforcements are here. there's quite a few of them. keep them occupied. leave the rest to me. swirling smoke jutsu. smoke. never mind. attack. the platoon will follow me. i said not to order me around. how tragic. to be forced to fight when there is no desire to fight. they.made peace with themselves. who are you referring to. those guys from the cloud. they were able to clear their conscience. after such a long a time. do you have any regrets. i died when i was so young. wouldn't it be strange if i didn't have regrets. well then, so do i.. what about you, priest. death is one's destiny. you're quite enlightened. but not during my lifetime. what about you. i felt no lingering attachments in life. although now that i'm dead. i do feel some regret. regrets. what a funny thing for you guys to talk about. however, i didn't reanimate you for such discussions. i've just returned. how did it go. there's no mistake. it's gari, the explosivestyle user from the hidden stone. rummaging for corpses again. at least call it "graverobbing. " whatever. you're still just exploiting the dead. don't.sasuke. good work, kabuto. yes. okay, i'm ready, orochimaru. what are you making me do today. don't be so hasty. today's training will be special. lord orochimaru was killed. and i was alone once again. however. however, i never tried to surpass lord orochimaru. i simply clung onto his power. i understand how you felt now. you made me realize something. you made me realize that i wanted to be like you. so this time, i'm going to surpass lord orochimaru whom i've taken in my body and find my new, powerful self. what. i thought you were sasori. but you're his grandmother. the great naruto bridge the demon. zabuza momochi. carry on once again as one of the seven ninja swords men of the mist. asuma sarutobi dan kato hayate gekko sukezo yamamoto jouta mishina you're hanzo of the salamander. nno, i'm the righthand man of his righthand man. heiji of the rain shelter. fire temple you are chiriku of the guardian shinobi twelve. no. i am chiriku's mentor, chukaku. oh, you're stronger than chiriku. no, i am merely a scholar. what a motley crew of failures. still, i have use for them. good grief. this is all of them. i don't know. maybe some escaped under cover of the smoke. contact hq. tell them that they were targeting the sealed reanimated ninja. ask if the others are safe. i see it. over there. hurry. we must rendezvous with gaara's main company. temari. a message from hq. we must turn back immediately. what.. someone known as the third raikage is sealed in there. i guess that means we're supposed to resurrect him. leave it to me. trap it's a barrier. earth style: sand dance. the barrier is broken, but. i can't undo this. it's a stubborn jutsu formula, isn't it. first, we have to decode that jutsu formula. well then, it's my turn. although i have no desire to do this. but can you do it. jutsu formulas fall under the expertise of we priests. hey, not bad, priest. blade dance jutsu. it took forever to seal the raikage. we're not going to let him come back. temari. huh. how i've longed to see you, temari. huh.. she knows him. beats me. ddaimaru.. how'd you become reanimated.. i have nothing to lose anyway, so i'll tell you. wwhat's that.. i've always loved you. wind scythe. oh well, it can't be helped. after all, i'm a reanimation. but temari. at least tell me how you feel about me. listen. when we were kids, you were always mean to me. and you tell me this now. oh well. i'm sorry about back then. but i'm dead, so i can tell you. you were always on my mind. then why were you so mean.. aw c'mon, temari, it can't be helped. boys are like that. like what. like that. i think it's beautiful, temari. there's someone who wants to declare his love for you. more so, now that he's dead. it's so romantic. it's only because he's been reanimated. actually, i'm surprised that you were. hey, i'm daimaru the red cloud of dust. like the unremarkable crank mission where you lost your life, your name is unknown. temari. did you hate me. no. it was fun being around someone who wasn't intimidated by me being the kazekage's daughter or the older sister of gaara. then. then had i lived, would you have gone out with me. nope. no way. no way. damn, you're so honest. i like that about you. temari already has someone she likes. yup, an intelligent guy. i figured so. no, i don't. there's no one. okay, better seal me. when i heard you had died, i was sad. seeing you now must be fate. did you cry. tell me, did you cry for me. no. i didn't cry. sealing team. make it snappy. rright. so long, temari. so long, daimaru. now then. be careful. he belonged to the leaf's foundation and was danzo's bodyguard. he must be strong. as you know. we cannot defy our orders. therefore, stay away from me. blade dance jutsu. was that a clone jutsu. notify hq about him. we're going to rendezvous with the main company.  right.  right. we couldn't retrieve the pawns we lost. but this pawn has turned out to be quite a find. hurry up and seal me. or you'll be destroyed. good job finding me. my beetles notified me. based on your appearance, it seems you were reanimated. do you remember my venomous beetles. hurry and call for reinforcements. you won't be able to stop me by yourself. no, i'm the only one who can stop you. next time on naruto shippuden: "shino vs. torune." as insect users, let's settle this just between us. shino vs. torune. tune in again. )
