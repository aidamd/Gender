" "a lone shinobi staked his life to seal away this beast. " 'morning. 'morning. you came home late last night. yeah. i was with lord third. how did your discussion go. huh. you mentioned an important meeting. did it go well. there's no need for you to dirty your hands anymore. the unlikeliest alliance between the uchiha and senju has protected the peace of the hidden leaf village. and will continue from this night forward until the end of time. oh, it was fine. where's naruto. he said an important mission was going to be assigned today so he couldn't be late, but. naruto. naruto. what.. it's already this late. 'morning. i'm off. hey, that's bad manners. i have to hurry or i won't make it for the meeting time kakashi's sensei set. it's always like this. you spoil him too much. can you please scold him too. all right. all right. we're going to get an sranked mission today. oh, isn't that the ninetailed. he's still the hokage's son. just let sleeping dogs lie. i don't like it one bit. all right. who's there.. scaring me like that. hey. oh, it's you, young lord naruto. mister, how much is this mask. don't even ask. i can't take money from you, young lord. lord hokage would scold me if i did. please take it. that's okay. i don't have any money today. i see. thank you though. i'll come back to buy it. sheesh. lord hokage this, lord hokage that. hey, throw some salt. it's supposed to be a secret in the village. but everyone knows what that kid is. if he weren't the hokage's son, he'd have been chased out of the village by now. hey, shiro. 'morning. oh, naruto. good morning. hey, big brother itachi. good morning. is sasuke around. thanks for coming to see him all the time. my kid brother is just so unfriendly. leave him to me. i'll train him right. thanks. be a good friend to him. sure. who's training whom. i'm not so pitiful that i need a loser like you to train me. it's okay. i don't mind at all. we're friends, aren't we. since when are we friends.. you don't have to come and get me every morning. just seeing your face during missions is more than enough. yeah right. you're actually happy that i came. what's wrong. who's that.. what happened.. are you okay. hang in there. aageha. kakashi sensei, what's our new mission. before that, i want to show you something. look here. the names of legendary heroes are carved here. legendary heroes. i'm definitely going to make it so my name gets on here. they were all killed in action during missions for our village. huh.. but there are those who put their lives at risk and fought for the village. and even saved their comrades. yet, they weren't given a heroes' burial, let alone buried in an ordinary grave. why isn't this person with the others. during an extremely difficult mission, he was a captain and infiltrated enemy territory. there, he was faced with a difficult choice. continue the mission or sacrifice the lives of his men. which did he choose. clearly, he chose his comrades' lives, right. in order to save the lives of his comrades, he cancelled the mission. i knew it. however, the village suffered huge losses. he was held responsible and blamed for his actions. in the end, even the men whose lives he saved criticized him. as a result, the deep hurt took its toll mentally and physically. and he took his own life.  but.that's.  why.. he broke the code in order to save his men's lives. the first thing we learn at the academy is that the mission takes utmost priority, under the shinobi rules. but. in the shinobi world, those who break the rules are scum. that's. however. those who don't value their comrades. .are worse than scum. and so, until you get the signal to assemble. go do some training. scatter.  rright.  rright. what's the matter. so tell me. why was i grouped together with naruto. do you object. no, i don't have a problem with it. but if he's put on a team where there's too much of a difference in skill levels, he's bound to suffer. you were the academy's most promising student. are you blaming naruto for sranked missions not coming your way. because it certainly seems that way. it could just be the opposite. i have a feeling that today's the day that we'll get an sranked mission. all right. i'm gonna go all out. honestly. how can you be so positive about life. well, i'm gonna be the hokage some day. for the sake of the village, i can't be a downer. talk about dreaming. no. it's possible naruto might become the hokage. sasuke. so you do acknowledge my abilities, after all. don't be stupid. you're the son of the fourth hokage. i'm just saying even the biggest loser can follow in the hokage's footsteps with a little favoritism. what.. you have no right to talk to me like that until you beat me with your ninjutsu. i don't need ninjutsu to beat you. lions barrage. stop. don't fight. we're on the same team. that was nothing. sasuke. let's race to see who can make it to the top of that rock. on your mark. hey. get ready.go. he doesn't know when to give up. lord hokage just gave us the sign to assemble. but naruto is. what about naruto. damn it. like i'm going to give up. i'll never give up despite what anyone says. sasuke. i don't see him catching up. i knew it. damn it. it will be interesting to see. whether the power you have been given is truly for you. if you don't want to die, figure it out yourself. i'll never give up. never. never. no way. a voice in pain. a bitter and sad voice. yyou're huge. you're the. i wasn't expecting to hear that from you. didn't your parents tell you. oh, you're the ninetails, right. then this will be quick. what brings you to me. i'm letting you live inside my body. you owe me some rent. what.. lend me your chakra. you, ordering me around. you're greatly mistaken. anyway, if you die, i die. i'll show you first. watch carefully. summoning jutsu. if i could do that. summoning jutsu. so naruto dashed off for that rock. yes. he challenged sasuke to a race. but i didn't want to get involved. it seems he jumped over this. what. he fell from here.. what a fool. hey. what are you doing. better hurry or dad will get mad at us. fourth hokage jiraiya sensei. over there. i must put up a barrier immediately. my chakra is almost. i can still do it.minato. kushina. did i wake you up. i'm sorry, naruto. kushina. i'm going to pull the nine tails with me. to my death. then. kushina, there's no need for you to die with the nine tails. you sealing the nine tails' chakra in your state is physically impossible. but half should be possible. and the other half. i will seal it inside naruto with the eight signed seal. i know what you want to say. but in time, the nine tails' chakra. will open up naruto's future as a jinchuriki. i believe that if naruto is ever in danger, it will be invaluable. but right now, it seems to be just the opposite. well, he's just not able to manage the nine tails' enormous power yet. i'm sure he'll learn to control it in time. if.naruto is truly the child of prophecy. but if he's not able to fully control the nine tails. was it too soon. to let you go on this mission. no, sooner or later. you'll have to overcome this trial. all of our classmates have assembled for this mission. yeah. it's turned out just as we feared, huh. what. well, i want as little as possible to do with that guy and complete the mission successfully. each team will take a separate route to the target site. once there, you will search for the missing shinobi. send word the minute you discover them. do not rush out to try and rescue them. understand. you don't have to keep reminding us. i'll rescue every one of them. seems like someone over there doesn't get it. i knew it. this is going to turn out to be a drag. scatter. all right. let's do this. right around then, the young shinobi who just made genin, made their way to a village that had lost their jonin. amongst them was the child of prophecy, naruto. i know it's sudden, but let me go over the next mission. next time on naruto shippuden: "the search mission. " naruto, you will most likely be the one who. jiraiya ninja scrolls: the tale of naruto the hero the search mission tune in again. )
