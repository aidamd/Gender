ashura and indra elder brother. how can you read all that stuff.. and father too. why does he write so much. it all has to do with ninshu. every word means something. i know that, but. that's not it. like this, maybe. the two studied together, and played together. this one's huge. ashura. the net. get me the net. be careful. go slow and steady. gotcha. ashura. look. i got it, elder brother. damn it. you're so impulsive. you got a bite too. you're right. it might be bigger than yours. oh, it's just driftwood. whoa. amazing. it's a huge fish. nice one, ashura. yeah. but elder brother, what did you just do. at the time, ninshu did not have a practical application for fighting yet. my original intent for it was to help bring souls together. healthy bodies to sustain wholesome spirits. i didn't feel any need. for any martial arts that went beyond that. but due to indra's innovations, the course of ninshu was drastically changed. wow. wow. wwhat did you just do, elder brother.. when infusing chakra to release power, i noticed that the formation of your hands make a difference. i think you can use various powers by the way you shape and combine your fingers. really. so i'm calling the formation of your hands "sign" and the manifestation of the power "jutsu. " sign and jutsu. that's amazing, elder brother. i inherited powers from my mother, kaguya. so i don't have to weave signs to invoke jutsu. but this was not the case for my pupils with whom i shared my chakra. when indra was merely ten years old, he was inventing jutsu that even i could not do. he was one who was worthy of being called the "genius of ninshu. " the invention of jutsu using signs changed the foundation of people's lives. it became such that anyone who trained hard would be able to use jutsu. but i was a foolish father. i did not notice that the powers of darkness that were targeting indra were already on the move. ashura. are you okay. ouch. i'm okay, elder brother. when releasing chakra, you must be extremely careful. or you can be seriously hurt. we possess more chakra than other people. sorry. your invention has transformed ninshu greatly. yes. but i don't know if that was a good thing. why is that. training used to be more spiritual. now it's become focused on honing the jutsu itself. in time, it could be used as a weapon and create chaos in the world. your astuteness is almost frightening, my son. i didn't realize you had thought so deeply about it. yes. but what will be will be. no one can stop the flow of time. had you not invented signs, someone else would have. if chakra is to become a weapon, then we must train the soul even harder to control that chakra. so it was you. you inherited mother's powers. who's there.. come out. i'll always be watching you. very impressive, master indra. next up, master ashura. stop there. are you okay, ashura. you're really strong, elder brother. training's over. i'm going to play with taizo and the others. good grief. father, i'm going to go train a little more on the hill in the back. it seems master indra has assumed great command of the powers you passed on to him. and that's a good thing. why is that. well, if you're to name a successor one day, it's customary to select the first son. having a younger son inherit could sow the seeds of discontent. no one would object to master indra, him being the one naturally gifted with ninshu. the future of ninshu is now secure. hey. you're late, ashura. sorry, sorry. i'll have you know that i came as soon as i finished with training. anyway, what's up. look at this. what is this. wild boar tracks. a lot of the fields have been damaged recently. that's not good. why don't we go and hunt it down. but isn't that dangerous. we should be fine. if worse comes to worst, we've got ashura. you can use your ninshu to bring it down. what.. that's right. so let's go. are you there.. i'm so happy that you sensed my presence. it's a child. what do you want. why do you keep following me. you will grow strong. you have the desire, potential, and talent for ninshu. however. you're still not aware of your true power. my "true power". an even greater power lies dormant inside you. but there is one condition for awakening that power. who are you. how do you know that. it doesn't matter. if you awaken your power, my wish will come true one day. well, never mind about that. we were talking about awakening your power, weren't we. do you want to know how. it has nothing to do with training, you know. you must lose love. what do you mean. like having a person you love, die. let's test it out. what are you going to do. wait. ashura. over here. the tracks continue over here. hey. don't tell me. there it is. run. it's coming this way. all right. i'll use that. what's with him anyway.. that's no ordinary boar. ashura. use ninshu. um.um. watch out, ashura. run away. shiro. ashura. elder brother. hurry, go. how dare you do this to my younger brother. are you all right. yeah. but shiro's. shiro gave his life to protect you. give him a proper burial. okay. brother, your eyes. this is. elder brother. i know you're there. what did you do.. oh nothing. that's your true power. from now on, you'll use those eyes to see the truth. see you later. he's gone. amazing. ouch. put everything you've got into it. yyes. ashura, you too. you can't expect to use ninshu like that. okay. sorry. ever since he awakened his sharingan, master indra's progress has been phenomenal. he's disciplined and he has the right temperament to guide others. he can take over ninshu anytime. master indra is simply amazing. when he glares at you with those eyes, i can't even move. he's so young, and he's already an instructor. master indra's the one who invented hand signs and jutsu. but recently he's been too strict. even earlier, he didn't go easy at all. if master indra becomes the successor, i don't know if i'd be able to follow him. you're right. sometimes the way master indra looks at us seems almost hateful. master ashura is much easier to approach, but he's not skilled at all. nothing ever goes perfectly, doesn't it. i'll say. elder brother. are you going to train in the mountains again. yes, that's my intent. can i come with you. i'm sorry. i want to train alone. with you, i. yeah, you're right. we're too far apart in skill. eelder brother. hmm. i. i think you should ease up on the others a bit during practice. when you're serious, they end up getting hurt. you have a point. i'll think about it. come out, i know you're here. impressive. it's been a while, hasn't it. i'm not like before. so it seems. have you gotten used to those eyes. don't glare at me like that. i wish you'd show me some gratitude at least. why should i be grateful to you. well. i'm the one who awakened those eyes. by the way. did you see something with those eyes. like the future of ninshu. or your dreams. you've already sensed it, right. that you're special. that you have the power to change the future of ninshu. you have overwhelming power. you've inherited most of hagoromo's power. ashura can't hold a candle to you. in time, your power will rival that of your father, hagoromo. no one will be able to compete with you. next. what's the matter.. isn't anyone willing to face me. such cowards. elder brother. why.. you said you'd think it over. ashura. you don't have the sharingan, so you won't understand. power is what rules the world. power maintains order. in time, i will take over ninshu and fulfill my dream. elder brother. hey, did you hear. it seems master hagoromo is close to choosing a successor for ninshu. it's between masters indra and ashura, eh. i wonder who it's going to be. it's plain as day. it's the eldest, master indra, who's got the outstanding natural gift for ninshu. next time on naruto shippuden: "the tumultuous journey" from here on, i will decide the successor for ninshu. the tumultuous journey tune in again. )
