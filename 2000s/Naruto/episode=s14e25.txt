run, omoi what.. did you say omoi deserted the battlefield.. is this true, kakashi. yes. reports say he ran from his post after saying he needed to leave for a bit. omoi. why. why would he do that. come back. my comradeinarms. damn it, omoi. what was he thinking.. doesn't he know the circumstances that we're in. that even losing one man could decrease the military strength of the unit. lord raikage. that's crazy. who'd believe that crap about him deserting. kkarui. he may look it, but he's not a coward. he'd never run away in the face of the enemy. it's got to be some mistake. well. i don't want to believe it either. but deserting one's post under enemy fire is considered a serious offense in the hidden cloud village. so. one thing comes to mind. is that you, sai. just before omoi left, we received a report that the unit on battlefield seven was under attack and needed reinforcements. when he heard that, i believe i saw omoi go pale. we received a distress call asking for reinforcements four hours ago. they were surrounded by a large number of white zetsu and couldn't move. two thousand of them. two thousand. we had no troops nearby, so we told them to hang tight. we haven't heard from them since. perhaps that's where omoi was headed. who's holding down battlefield seven. the amphibious search and destroy unit. most of them are from hidden mist village and 24 of them were deployed to the front. hidden mist. why would omoi go. we received a disturbing message right after that. a supply unit which was on the road near battlefield seven never reached their destination. maybe they went to aid the amphibious s&d unit. this supply unit. who are they. the hidden cloud's. thundercloud unit. what did you say. the thundercloud unit. what kind of unit is it. it's made up of seven, twelve to thirteenyearolds. they're young, but extremely talented. it was decided they were ready for war, and i assigned them to start with the supply unit. i guess it was premature. so omoi knew that. that idiot. check on the chakra levels on battlefield seven. is anyone in the unit alive.. white zetsu are overrunning the area. as for chakra from our side. seven are present. seven. the same number as the thundercloud unit. don't even think about it, lord raikage. those kids knew exactly what they were getting into. they were prepared to die in the battlefield. those kids.are alive. damn it. omoi. omoi. sorry, everyone. omoi. return to your post. we're at war. you can't just do whatever you want. please give me one hour. i'll bring every one of them back in one hour. will you stop all this nonsense.. how can you be so easygoing and say such a thing.. what happened to the guy who's always so worried. every unit has lost members. it's just wishful thinking to assume that the seven survivors are all from the thundercloud unit. sorry. but the seven are those kids. still. you'll never make it, even if you depart now. we're done here if you're just gonna bore me. see ya. hey, omoi. omoi. knowing them, they've already taken down the enemy and are celebrating. they could even be into their second round of partying. "we can't have any alcohol, okay. so let's toast with juice. " man, if they say that, it's gonna last until morning. no good, he's not answering. lord raikage. i'm so sorry. please capture that fool and tie him up, or whatever. but if there are survivors from the thundercloud. we can't give them any special treatment. kakashi, guy, lee, sai. you can handle things there for about one hour, can't you. even if it's just for an hour, losing someone strong like omoi hurts. but we'll manage. if we try five times harder, no, ten times harder, it's possible. just leave it to us. i'll fight a hundred times harder. i'll do things my own way. well, you heard them. i'm grateful. sorry, omoi. i'm counting on you. but omoi alone. give me the position of naruto's shadow clones. that kid.. just one of his shadow clones has the strength to protect an entire village. lady hokage, that's overstating it a bit. there's just one. a shadow clone is headed in the direction of battlefield seven. although he's not that close. notify naruto. i promised lord raikage that i'd do it one hour. but what if i finish this up in 30 minutes. what if he's so impressed, he says, "good job. you're the next raikage." oh but. rather than one hour, it could take three hours. then he might say, "go back to the village." all right, i'm getting close. beyond this hill, the land will be all cleared with nary a blade of grass. they'll have rolled out the red carpet, and hung up a banner for me that says, "welcome, omoi." are you kidding me. is this a prank. the hidden mist's. you know, you can't stop us. damn.you guys. where the hell's the red carpet.. sorry, but this doesn't mean i'm going to give up. naruto uzumaki. at your service. you're... that jinchuriki from before. naruto uzumaki. rasengan barrage. amazing. you're omoi, right. i don't understand what's going on. but i believe you. huh. those kids are alive. save them, no matter what. this isn't about believing. they're alive and they're waiting. yeah. with him here. we can take care of these guys. instead of thirty minutes, i can finish this in twenty. and lord raikage will say, "i was right. you are the next raikage." come on. huh.. uhoh. i did it. oh, good. it was a shadow clone. it's not good at all. naruto was nice enough to. i'm such a fool. naruto probably thought i could handle it alone and purposely. let himself get hit. yeah. these guys aren't that good. i can handle them alone. those kids are alive. on second thought, it's impossible to do this in thirty minutes. even with an hour, it still wouldn't be possible how about two hours. if i get it done in two hours, maybe lord raikage will give me a break. and still name me as a candidate to become the next raikage. what the.. the poison gas they're exhaling. red dirt. the white guys turned red. does it have something to do with the red dirt. what do i do. beyond this point lies a field of poison. what is that. found them. they're in there. i'm sure of it. they're alive. they're alive. they're alive. they're alive. they're definitely alive. no. stay away. get out of here. it's no good. we'll be found right away. they'll be on to us sooner or later. and we're going to run out of air. it was too much for us. we weren't ready for battle. that's why lord raikage assigned us to the supply unit. it's too late for that. why didn't you oppose it when yukai suggested that we go and help. sorry. i'm just frustrated that we weren't able to do anything. so am i. i'm mad too, yukai. i feel horrible that my decision as a leader. i can't stand this either. if we're just going to wait for death like this. let's go out with a big bang, together. i jumped in the water to get away. but i still can't breathe. damn it, i've reached my limit. lightning style. thunderbolt. this is. they're alive. they're alive. they're alive. even if we all die, if we can at least deal a blow.. just one blow. my big brother gave me.this. big brother omoi. lightning style. team thunder bomb. this red soil is rich in moisture. so naturally, the conductivity of the lightning style is gonna be amazing. it's okay to breathe, right. yeah, but it's not as fresh as a mountain breeze. i've used up my chakra. big bro omoi, give us a chance to look good too. well, i guess you guys can manage. let's go. didn't i tell you they were alive. someone who left his post and acted without orders has no right to talk. and tell your inexperienced subordinates not to show off. nope, it's about time they started showing off. these guys have come of age. omoi. you greenhorn. llord raikage. i gave you one hour, no more. if you don't return within that time, i will punish you myself. so be prepared. i understand. thanks. omoi. i bet i'm gonna fall into a hole somewhere. and i'll be stuck because it's so deep. and i won't be able to get out and the clock will keep ticking. and i won't make it back by the promised time. and i'll incur lord raikage's wrath and. oh man, why am i always so unlucky. i finally caught up. you're late. what were you doing. a persistent pee, yo. anyway, one of your clones contacted me. what happened to the other clones. they should be arriving at the frontlines of every battlefield. all the fakers we'll seek out all the bad guys we'll defeat, no doubt next time on naruto shippuden: "reinforcements arrive" reinforcements arrive we gotta hurry too. tune in again. )
