we're almost there. are you ready, yuukimaru. do i really have to do this. that is your duty. but i know it's going to make me feel awful again if you like, i can tell yuukimaru for you that the kind, gentle guren whom he believes is the one he should return to, is the evil villain who killed his mother stop. then, carry out my orders. we're running out of time. let's hurry. how is it. there's been no reaction. i see she used up considerable chakra during that last encounter. this is the time to strike. i don't want to give her too much time. i agree. i'm going to widen the scope of my search. damn. where'd that crystal style user disappear to.. don't panic. i know but if we let her slip away, yuukimaru will i'll find him no matter what. the battle over the barrier cripes, what's going on. this is the pits. you guys are on the verge of death. hah. speak for yourself. oh i feel like i'm gonna faint as if i'm gonna die in a place like this. not after we survived that hellhole of a camp. that's the seal to capture the threetails. this is bad. they're well into the ritual. now then, yuukimaru we don't have time. hey guren, do something. guren never mind. you are going to betray us. i have no intention of defying you. but that jutsu will cause too much damage. so please let me try one more time. not that again. at a time like this. in your reluctance to use yuukimaru, you've lost almost all your men. on top of that, you yourself have been beaten and you still think you can fight. that's the least you can do in that state is well there is a way without using yuukimaru. but time is of the essence. this is on the condition that you follow my orders completely. i understand. the minute you show signs of defiance, or if you fail, i won't hesitate to use him. yeah humph, all right then. come, yuukimaru. don't worry. i'm taking him where he'll be safe. and what's the plan. i'll tell rinji the plan. you just follow his instructions. the threetail's power won't reach you here. will guren be okay. she's the one who insisted on this. she'll have to do it even if it kills her. do not move from this spot. tell me the plan. guren hurry it up. you're wasting time. yes. according to kabuto, there are two guarding the seal. one is a weapons user and the other a taijutsu user. they've already gone through a surprise attack, so they've increased their guard. i see. in other words, the way to catch their attention is a flashy diversion. a decoy is necessary. all right. let's do it. i'll take care of those two in front. but are you sure about this, guren. i have enough chakra to be a decoy. you focus on finding the right moment to break the seal. the threetails is completely ensnared within the seal. good. now let's narrow the sphere of the fourcorner sealing barrier until the threetails' freedom is totally restricted. yes. yes. huh.. tenten. i know. who's there.. two kids protecting the precious seal. what a laugh. that jutsu. are you the crystal style user.. isn't the crystal style counter team supposed to deal with her.. so what'll you do. run away with your tails between your legs. no such thing. i'd like nothing better than to battle the crystal style user everyone's been talking about. that's some confidence for a kid from the hidden leaf. concentrate, everyone. the net is tight enough. now we'll lock it from all four sides and completely seal the threetails. right. right. fourcorner sealing barrier lock. i'm your opponent. this resistance is strange it's as though too bad. she covered her body with crystal. damn normally, i'd have beaten enemies like them long ago. not yet. judging from the chakra i have left, there's just one or two more jutsu i can use. if that's the case. i'll end it with this next one. ino. my control did we fail. i'm sorry. we'll lock the seal once more. die. now. this is bad. shoot. eat this. collaboration ninjutsu. wind style: toad water pistol. what.. naruto. yay, we did it. that's the way it should be. i finally found you, crystal style user. why you. whatever it takes that seal must be broken. shino. whwhat.. the seal. senpai. hmm. it's you, yamato. as you predicted, we encountered the enemy's diversionary team. but they weren't very strong and ran off. then we split up into two i sent lee and tenten to protect the sealing team. how about you. it's bad. we found a way to counter the crystal style, but she gave us the slip. what.. quickly, go help protect the sealing team. damn it. we won't be able to sustain the barrier. iit's so huge. wha.. what is this.. oh no. what chakra. this is the threetails. the barrier is broken. senpai. our assignmentis here. brother i'm scared. that shock wave. what kind of dangerous place did you summon us to this time.. this isn't the time to talk like that. our goal has been achieved. you've lost the jutsu to seal the threetails. why you i can't forgive you. rinji, pull back. you won't get away. no. guren gguren. get away. where'd they go. there no. no. stop. don't. no. kabuto you seem to be having a hard time drawing out yuukimaru's power. if you try to force it out, it won't be real power. when there is true desire in the heart and that desire is strong that is when he finds real strength that even he did not know he had. is this. what is that. i've seen it before it's just like back then yuukimaru. huh.. guren, did you finish your moving reunion. rinji, it's you. i blocked the hidden leaf's sealing jutsu. now let's go back with yuukimaru. it was you, all along. huh. what are you talking about.. well, let's get along for lord orochimaru's sake. you why.. since you're the trigger to move yuukimaru, who's the tool to control the monster next time: "red camellia" let's see, today's minicorner is huh. it's terrible, naruto. it's terrible. naruto. it's terrible. naruto. about today's minicorner oh, i have the script right here. you won't believe this. the script is blank. huh.. our staff is slacking off. they left the studio. date. come on out. a cue card what. ad lib this part. i'm tired from the main episode. well then. i shall perform a oneman act to show off my beautiful body that won't bring in high viewer ratings. i'll use my feminine wiles to snare the boys instead. how about my weapon collection this calls for the main character, that's me. and i'll there's something weird about the movement. hey. i thought i made it in time what i can'tmove oh no it stopped. even the color hey datecchi. cut it out. huh.. do you want me to draw this in. director. tune in again. )
