there we go. all right. okay, storage complete. i'm taking you back to hidden leaf village. after that, we'll have to look for the octopus. just like giant gramps sage predicted, i'm going to look for an octopus and train to control the nine tails' power. and i'll meet sasuke once more. okay, let's. now, young man. time to go. the young man and the sea wow. look, it's the sea. yahoo. the sea is great. that is the land of fire's only port. from there, we'll depart for the hidden cloud village in the land of lightning. say. what's this topsecret mission that granny tsunade mentioned. it's called a topsecret mission because it's a secret, naruto. oh, come on. don't say that. you can tell me. ill explain later. i guess he still hasnt come up with a cover story to fool naruto. lady tsunade, why did you assign naruto on an srank mission at such a critical time. not only that, you sent him to the land of lightning by sea. yes. the akatsuki is targeting naruto. i chose a difficult sea voyage on purpose in order to prevent the enemy from finding him. what will naruto be doing in hidden cloud village in the land of lightning. i'm leaving that up to raikage. wow. that's a grand sailing ship you readied for us. actually. our hidden leaf ship is the one next to it. that one over there. aw man, it looks so shabby. it's a topsecret mission. a big ship would attract attention, right. it's better to go to the island on a boat like this. i don't see any of the seamen. about that. they refused to set sail into the open sea. what. don't tell me you were stingy on the pay.. no, it's not that. well. tell me. i won't get upset. well, they say there is a monster out there that attacks any boat that tries to set sail. a monster. oh, boy. looks like i drew the short end of the stick. i don't know what's going to appear, but i'll crush it to bits. i dont know if it was a good idea for guy to make such a promise. we dont even know what kind of monster it is. im sure hell be fine. see. he looks so eager doing warmup exercises. are you all right, guy. ththis is nothing. i didn't know the boat would sway so much. my stomach is a little shocked, thats all. how can you crush a monster in that condition. sure i can. i may not look it, but when the time comes, i'll be strong. we're in open sea. i don't see anything. damn monster. did it get scared and run away after seeing me, the leafs burning hurricane. a monster. is that a sword. a type of summoning animal. but i dont sense any jutsu user. could it be a wild summoning animal. its coming back. avoid it. there's not enough time. stay back, aoba. i'll stop it. guy, behind you. what.. i won't make it. i got you. damn monster. don't be so reckless, pal. my name is yusuke. who the hell are you and how can you stand on the ocean surface.. i'm naruto, a ninja from the hidden leaf. leave the rest to me. i can't weave my signs like this. wood style: giant forest. you have to undo your jutsu or you'll be drawn in. quickly, take him and go. scattering crow jutsu. big catch why would there be a summoning animal in a spot like that. maybe it survived the third great ninja war. no wonder the seamen are scared. that thing's been living there for about 15 years. i see. normally, when the ninja who is contracted with it dies, the animal returns to its own world. but why is that one acting up like that. maybe the war has not ended for that summoning animal. yeah. your ninja wars are such a nuisance. because of that thing, all the cowardly seamen refuse to go to sea anymore. cowardly. what were you thinking, doing something so dangerous.. a fisherman's job is to catch fish. i thought i was gonna get rid of him once and for all, only to have you interfere. if i hadn't saved you, you'd be fish food about now. you should just leave that thing to us and stop acting so recklessly. shut up. if anyone beats that thing, it's gonna be me, yusuke. im not asking for much. if i only had a sturdier boat that could withstand that marlin's body blows. and an internalcombustion engine to match that marlin's power. and maybe a fishing rod that has a lure and won't snap. that's asking for quite a lot. tell me. how come you're so determined to get that marlin. is that your dad. we're dead serious about fighting that fish. a guy who'd lose. isn't worth being called a father or a son. captain yamato, isn't there anything we can do. like what. like lending him a hand. i want yusuke to avenge his dad. but you have an srank mission. ive been moved to tears, yamato. lets give him a helping hand. come on, do it. ill do it too. well, as long as that monster is there, we can't set sail. you see. if that marlin is a summoning animal, then we shinobi are to blame for yusuke's misfortune. and it's not like that marlin is here because it wants to be. okay, okay. i understand. all right. big catch yusuke. we have a fishing rod too. naruto. what do you think. i tried making them with the data i had available. i have no quarrel with the boat or the rod. but this is not a motorized boat. without an internal combustion engine that can match the marlin's power, it's useless. you can leave that to me. when it comes to power, no one can compete with i, might guy, the noble blue beast. so what do you say. can't you mind your own business. with all this, you're taking the thrill out of the fight. well, arent you stubborn. giant marlin spotted 30 degrees to the right. hey, go around in front of him. you got it. we're up front. okay, i'm going to release the lure. hey, what is that.. it's a special lure made in proportion to its huge size. i meant, why does it look just like me. you're showy and look like you'd be good bait. no. i'm gonna get eaten. faster. we have to make it think this lure is nice and fresh. leave it to me. eight inner gates. second gate, gate of rest. open. bushy brow sensei. faster. fourth gate, gate of pain. fifth gate, gate of closing. open. come on, come on, come on. bull'seye. he took the bait. oh, that hurts my heart. say, we have to reel it in quickly. you idiot. if we did that, the line would snap. we'll let it play and wait until it tires out. we'll run out of line like this. i know that. let it pull the boat. can you keep up with it. nothing is impossible for me. you don't need to row anymore. just follow the marlins lead and steer the boat. good. i was reaching my limit. swim, swim. use up all your strength. it's got amazing stamina to swim at this speed. but it will eventually use up the energy to resist. then the real fight begins. it's finally showing signs of exhaustion. yusuke. stay out of my way. this fight is between him and me. i know that. here we go. this time this time for sure. guess its time to help out. don't help him. yusuke will get his revenge with his own two hands. oh dear. i guess we have no choice. all right, just a little more. give it up already. he still has so much strength. yusuke. you avenged your dad. yeah. why didn't that summoning animal return to its birthplace. easy there. i'll get it out. this is. it's a demon wind shuriken from the hidden leaf. so it was a victim of the third great ninja war, after all. if possible, we'd like to return it to its birthplace. sure, do whatever you like with it. our oneonone duel is over. no more grudges. i cant take it anymore. get me off this ship. get a hold of yourself, bushy brow sensei. but these waves are indeed hard to take. then what are we going to do. get me off. get me off, please. its going to be off course, but there should be an island up ahead. thats it. lets stop there. set sail towards northnortheast. next time on naruto shippuden: the ninja of benisu naruto. what are you doing here. tune in again. )
