what. what happened.. please wait a minute. i'll replace it right now. lady tsunade, are you going to stay here. yes, just a little longer. it's not good for your health, so please don't overdo it. i know. lord jiraiya put his heart and soul into this work. i don't blame her for getting so absorbed in it. jiraiya ninja scrolls: the tale of naruto the herothe child of prophecy hmm a fourth tail.. i guess it was still too soon for naruto to be able to control the nine tails' chakra. suppress i have no choice but to lock the eight signed seal once more. naruto. stay quiet just for a little while. art of the raging lion's mane. suppress i think i broke a few ribs. summoning: bring down the house jutsu. earth style: the dark swamp. naruto. take back your self. naruto. sage jiraiyaboy. the great lord elder had a dream about you. as you know, it is a prophecy. listen closely. yes, sir. i shall now tell you. in my dream, you, who are solely pervy, will still manage to become a splendid shinobi. and in time, you will have your own disciples. "solely pervey". i can't believe he just remembers that particular detail. one such disciple will come to possess a great power. depending on how you guide him, the future of the shinobi world will undergo a great change. i'm going to guide him. furthermore, it is your disciple who will influence the future of the shinobi world greatly. my disciple is. yes. the future of the shinobi world will be wrought with many calamities. and one of your disciples will be the one who will cast away those calamities. however. if they are guided in the right direction, the world will change for the good. if they are guided in the wrong direction, they will bring about great ruin. you are the one who will guide the child of prophecy in the right direction. the child of prophecy. impossible. to think the one who might bring about great ruin is.. do you all plan on ignoring the rules of the village. yeah. we can't return to the village when our friends are being held captive. we all agree on that. why did i think you would be like itachi. perhaps it's still too soon for you. sasuke. itachi was able to perfectly master it when he was about your age. and currently, itachi has been appointed to the anbu, under lord hokage's direct supervision. the leaf police force upholds the laws of the village. and i was hoping to fill the void left by itachi's transfer. focus. i won't lose to big brother. to honor the rules, i'll destroy the puppets. i see. a smokescreen. sasuke. he created a blind spot for the puppet user. that was so reckless. fire style. fireball jutsu. so i guess it won't be that easy. even if our goals differ, we can't ignore our friends. everyone, follow lee. human boulder. roll. roll. roll. cha. fang over fang. sasuke. i hope you didn't charge at the puppets by yourself, because you knew full well that we don't leave our friends behind. they attacked the puppets. do they intend on bringing down the puppets, and then return to leaf village. did they choose the rules over their friends. even the young ones cannot break free of the curse of rules. after all, a caged bird is a caged bird. they don't know how to fly freely through the heavens. has your byakugan become cloudy. what.. they're not fighting because they want to honor the rules. they're fighting for their friend. they're not bound by the rules. by their own will, they're fighting to save their friend. i guess this is far enough. they've already decided. it's pretty obvious. there's no future for shinobi. there is only.hell. let me show you an artistic and eternal hell. damn it. he had spare puppets. you said there are three steps in the training.right, dad. you've only taught me two. that's right. now then. this is an ordinary balloon. the first step is rotation. the second step is force. i'm able to do up to there. and the third step is. the one in my right palm looks like an ordinary balloon, right. yyeah. if you reproduce the contents of the balloon with your right hand. amazing. massive chakra revolves erratically. and it goes faster and faster. but the balloon remains perfectly round. namely, the chakra in the second step which was infused with force, is fixed inside the balloon. "fixed". as you put force into the chakra, you compress it and fix it. huh.. it's hard enough making it turn and adding force with both hands. you can increase it even more.. i guess you could use all the extra help you can get. but if you can do this. whoa. awesome. this rasengan is a super highlevel ninjutsu. only two shinobi can do this: jiraiya sensei and i. do you think i'll be able to do it too. yeah. i'm sure you will. oh yeah. "all the extra help, i can get. " damn it. what's going on. there's no end to this in sight. sakura. wait. i'm coming to save you. naruto.. pervy sage.. you're back. how did you get hurt.. it's nothing, don't worry. but i can't move, so i'm going back for now. so you'd better get back to the others. reverse summoning jutsu. what, what.. ouch. this isn't good. at this rate, they'll be.  wait.  but.. the way things are going, the hidden leaf shinobi are in danger. no. i sense massive chakra. why did this turn into such a drag. i'm such an idiot. multi shadow clone jutsu. rotation. force. and with some "extra help," i can fix it. what is that.. look at the chakra. that jutsu. it's the rasengan. impossible. that's because that jutsu is. naruto's amazing. naruto. here i go. rasengan. what.. next one. let's go. here we go. multi shadow clone jutsu. naruto.. damn you. you ruined my art. are you the puppet user.. damn it. he got away. that was amazing, naruto. taking down all those puppets, by yourself. i think i might have underestimated you all this time. yeah. you were hiding some amazing power. that power has to be acknowledged. that's because, everyone had a tough time with the enemy, but you came and took them down by yourself. as one would expect of naruto. i was totally surprised. they say skilled hawks hide their talons. i hate to admit it, but this is the one time i have to acknowledge him. but the way, naruto. we're going to save our friends. it will mean disobeying the rules of the village. but that's what we all want. yeah.of course, i feel the same way. what will you do, sasuke.. with this much fighting strength, you can't say rescuing our friends is impossible. sasuke, come with us. whatever. all right. it's decided. everyone, you heard it. we've joined up. we're going to rescue asuma and. no, we're going to find our friends and rescue them.  all right.  all right. has your socalled test produced a result. i believe it's already been proven that they consider the bonds of friendship more important than the rules of the village. so there's no need to continue this test. you will release all the hidden leaf shinobi you've abducted, right. father. who are you. we are not your enemies. first of all, we have to show you a sign of mutual trust. we apologize for getting you involved in the test that our employer devised. the test is over. we'll release your friends. are you telling the truth. next time on naruto shippuden: "the caged bird" you guys know pervy sage. jiraiya ninja scrolls: the tale of naruto the herothe caged bird tune in again. )
