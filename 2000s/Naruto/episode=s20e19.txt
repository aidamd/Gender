jiraiya ninja scrolls: the tale of naruto the heropursuers damn it, we lost them. where are they hiding. post superflat is my style of art, hmm. there he goes again, making a big spectacle. we knew things would end up like this. this is what happens when you leave things to deidara. but that's not good, is it. hey, did you witness my art. i got rid of those little gnats from the sand in one swoop, hmm. yyeah. what the hell are you doing.. if you mess up our precious targets like that, they'll be useless. like i care. my art culminates in an explosion. quit messing around, damn it. i found one we might be able to use. see. instead of complaining, start working like a real partner. you're gonna get it. let's go, hidan. i know it's upsetting, but our comrade calls. let's depart. damn it. naruto. these guys aren't under the hokage. they're from the underground organization, the foundation. i don't care if they're underground or aboveground. if they're trying to kill me, they should come at me fair and square with their faces showing. just try and get me. such a hotblooded child shadow clone jutsu. we're from the same village, but these guys what's going on. even if they're after the hokage's son. why now. i get it. there's another reason why they've come after us. bluntly, they want to make sure sasuke reaches orochimaru. sasuke. to orochimaru. i see. we're trying to bring sasuke back, so they're interfering with us. so that's how it is. you've got to be kidding. well, let 'em try and stop us. i'll kick their butts. neji. lee. tenten. run. what.. we're gonna run away.. we're going after sasuke. we can't be engaging in oneonone battles. and that's exactly what they want. so sasuke can get further and further away. you're right. we wasted time. neji. can you pinpoint sasuke's position.. byakugan. this way. we can still catch up to him. now then. we've got to do something about that too. here they come. damn it. that just cost us quite a bit of time. bushy brows. let lee handle this. we have to keep after sasuke. what're you saying.. we're all going to bring sasuke back. sorry, lee, but. i understand. i'll draw these guys in. all of you, go. go after sasuke. let's go. we're going to save sasuke. and i'm not letting a single one of you pass. shikamaru. you used lee to hold them back. yeah. considering what takes precedence, we need to get as close to sasuke as possible. looks that way. you're not getting away from me. after exchanging blows, i realize that you are very strong. and i admire your strength. and so.this opportunity to fight you fills me with happiness. i'm not as strong as you say, but i'll give it everything i've got. guts i will also give it my all. the fifth gate of closing. open. here's what you requested. they seem quite damaged. yeah. if you're not interested, i'll take 'em with me. of course, i'll take them. they'll decide whether they're usable or not if they complain, you tell 'em. these are the better ones. let's go. hey. hey, c'mon. damn it. they're all so. it doesn't seem like there's been much improvement to the akatsuki's military power. and here we are in a rush. the other corpses were too damaged to be of any use. after all the trouble we went through to lure talented hidden sand that had potential. that's true. the talented ones should be handled with care. exactly. but this idiot set off an explosion and blew up all the bodies. shut up. my explosion isn't just an average explosion. it's art. art, my foot. fine. go ahead and criticize me. enough. what's done is done. besides. it's not as though we don't have other options. why are you taking deidara's side.. remember the hizashi incident. it can be said that the akatsuki exists thanks to deidara. are you thinking of joining up with the genin from hidden leaf village. yeah. although we're from different villages, i feel like we can call them comrades. perhaps the day will come when we'll team up with them. nagato, what's that. doesn't it belong to those children. i found it on the road to the village. since it was chaotic with everyone trying to get home, they probably dropped it. they're probably making a fuss about missing their stuffed toy. all right, i'll go return it to them. yahiko. i'll be right back. wait here. damn it. we get called up for some experiment, so we come all the way here. and there's nothing to do. give me a break. my art is too extravagant and won't be of any use for this experiment.. that's bull. anyone who sees my art will be captivated by its brilliance. fine. i'll give 'em a grand performance. yahiko. nagato. nagato. nagato, hang on. why. why did this happen. who did this. was it you.. was this your doing. no. but we found this in the village. this is.. it's a special kunai the hidden leaf's hokage uses for his flying raijin jutsu. this hokage.of the hidden.leaf.. are you saying the hokage ordered this. yeah, probably. for the hidden leaf, this was an embarrassing and disgraceful incident they probably wanted it to look like this never happened. i'll never forgive him. from that day forward, nagato and konan stopped referring to themselves as team jiraiya. in other words, that was the day that triggered their desire for revenge against the hidden leaf. yeah. the greatest motivator for humans is revenge. by the way, what's gonna happen once the akatsuki strengthens its military power. beats me. you'd have to ask the guys on top. if there's anyone they want dead, i'll be happy to blow them up with my art. things will start happening in the near future. let's just wait and see. people of hidden leaf village. you must feel the same pain that i've experienced. unless you know the same pain, you can never really understand what others have felt. pain upon the great nation. hidden leaf style. crescent moon dance. sasuke. he's gonna get it when i catch up to him. he's not gonna look so cool when i'm done. i'll punch his eyes shut and make him cry. that jerk. you heard him, sasuke. three left. i wish we could weaken their strength all at once before they come at us tenten. i know. this time, i'll. just draw one of them out. don't overdo it. go. we hurried out. so these are the only scrolls i have oh no. this scroll is. moonlit night. my survival supply scroll came in handy. soon. i'll have power very soon. sasuke. sasuke. sasuke. so you're orochimaru. what did you do to sasuke.. you're still as annoying as ever sasuke, i'm here to take you back. give me a break. what can a loser like you do. i'll take you back by brute force if necessary next time on naruto shippuden: "collision" i'm not going to lose to you. jiraiya ninja scrolls: the tale of naruto the herocollision tune in again. )
