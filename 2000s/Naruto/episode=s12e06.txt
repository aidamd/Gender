"sometimes". it's been every night lately. i'll be sure to come home early. thank you. thanks, i'll come again. hey. watch where you're walking. why don't we just do rockpaperscissors again tonight. not that again. think of something more exciting. how can you call yourself my rival. we have an early start tomorrow. so let's pass for tonight. don't use a mission as an excuse. i have all this pentup energy inside me. now is the time for diligent training. honesttogoodness discipline and hard work lead to success in future missions. are you listening to me.. say guy. do you sense anything weird. there's been a chill in the air. it's your attitude that's causing it. we're only young once. what is this feeling. there, there. it's a strange feeling. of all times for mom and dad to be out. don't cry, sasuke. no matter what happens, your big brother will definitely protect you. it can't be. summoning jutsu.  what happened.  is it an accident. that's.. nno way.. the nine tails.  run.  it's the nine tails.  help.  we're done for. go, nine tails. lord third hokage. the nine tails is.. the nine tails has suddenly appeared in the village. i'm aware of that. i will suppress it. you and the others protect the civilians. yes sir. was kushina's seal broken. despite all the precautions, did we fail. biwako. damn you, nine tails. this is the moment i release my pentup power. don't be hasty, guy. come on. i'll be your opponent.  wait.  huh. gather immediately in the guardroom. why. it's the third hokage's orders. lord hiruzen. you heard. let's go, guy. now's our chance. evacuate the civilians. are we ready. yes. over here, nine tails. over here, nine tails. where are you looking.. over here. do not falter. even if we can't defeat the nine tails, we must concentrate on evacuating the villagers. do not take action on your own. assemble before lord hiruzen. carry out the orders. as hokage, i will protect the village, my family, right now. this is what i need to do. i won't allow it to do as it pleases anymore. so you've taken notice of me. you won't get your way here. for this large a scale, i'll have to be careful where i send it. the jutsu that stopped the nine tails' attack must be the teleportation barrier. it's minato. all right. we're going too. i must report all that's happened to lord third immediately. i'm your opponent. and it's all over. he flew away. he's fast. next time, i'll get him faster. the instant we make contact. my attack missed. but he materialized and instantly tried to drag me in. what is that jutsu. i won't let you get away. he uses the teleportation jutsu too. is that how he took kushina and moved away so quickly. a shinobi who outmaneuvered the anbu assigned under lord third's direct control. who slipped through a topsecret barrier. and who knew that the nine tails' seal would weaken during childbirth. furthermore, he undid the nine tails' seal, tamed it and. went in and out of the barrier set up by the hidden leaf without being caught. i know of only one shinobi capable of this. are you madara uchiha. no, that's impossible. he's dead. i wonder about that. at this point, it doesn't matter who you are. but why are you targeting the hidden leaf. i could say i did it on a whim, or that i planned it, or that it's war, or that it's for peace. whatever the case, he's no ordinary man. he can control the nine tails and his teleportation jutsu surpasses both lord second's and mine. and he has some dangerous ideology. i must deal with him now or he'll be even more trouble than the nine tails. if i transport myself to the village now, he will follow and the battlefield will become even more chaotic. if he's anything like madara, i can't keep the nine tails under the summoning jutsu for too long. i just have to entrust the village to lord third. as for me. i must take this guy down right here. now that i have freed the nine tails, you people have no hope left. his flesh. my physical attacks have no effect on him, but he makes himself materialize to attack me. namely, i can only aim for him when we both strike blows. but his risk lies during the moment of attack. and considering the time remaining on the nine tails' summoning jutsu, he doesn't relish a long battle either. the one who attacks an instant quicker than the other. will win this match. i win. damn it. he flew to that kunai from earlier. that was my flying raijin, level 2. you got me. this is what is meant by "elusive. " i should never have let down my guard. flying raijin jutsu. so that's it. he marked my body somewhere. a contract seal. he intends to separate the nine tails from me. with this, the nine tails no longer belongs to you. naruto, our newborn son. i wish i could've been with you. but our family is shinobi. we must sacrifice our lives to protect what we believe in. don't forget us naruto. we love you forever. next time on naruto shippuden: "thank you" i'm going to seal the nine tails in naruto. tune in again. )
