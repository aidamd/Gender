yota. please. stop it. yota. yota. sakura.. did you just say "yota".. is he there too.. what do you mean, "there too". he's with you also. not only sakura. but with us too. including kiba. oh boy. he's really going at it. there are four yotas. i wonder if yota is angry at us. maybe that's why he came to each of us. because we let him die. yota is not a ghost. he was reanimated and is being controlled. get your act together, choji. hold on a sec. so with reanimation, you can be resurrected lots of times like shadow clones.. not until now. i'm positive it's yota i'm facing. which means, all of you could be seeing that white guy. you mean, white zetsu. so he's not the real one.. but this snow is yota's. no. as long as the real one is performing the jutsu, it's possible. or should i say, the one controlling yota. everyone. these guys aren't yota. so you don't need to feel guilty. i'll take on your guilt. so. take them down. take down the yota impostors. naruto. sorry, yota. lingering snow yota. super expansion jutsu. shadow possession jutsu. yota. even if he is an impostor. let's go, akamaru. you've gotta be kidding. yota. back then, we tried to save yota. but. so i'm alone again. not really. there's six of us plus one dog. we all came. huh. what. you guys. you can't just walk in uninvited.. that's no way to talk. you looked so lonely right up 'til now. geez. it's so nice outside. if you stay cooped up like this, no one will want to... it's raining. huh. is it yota. we're going to get yota back. where are you from. what village. i don't.know. about complicated stuff. ask me easy questions. where are you from. what village. we're getting nowhere. we should ask lord third to come before things get more intense. was it genjutsu.. no. hey. stop it. get down from there. idiots. as if i'd do that. i'm naruto uzumaki. i'm a ninja. what. he's one of the students from the academy who was with the boy in custody. try and catch me if you can. all the ninja in the village. come and get me.  that damned brat.  hold it. sun showers. he's such a pain in the butt. i heard lord third's mountainside image is badly damaged. i heard that too. he lives in our village. how could he do such a thing. yikes. did you see anything. no. it was probably my imagination. probably. please, i beg you. let me go. shadow possession jutsu complete.  yota. hey.  yota.  hey. yota.  are you okay. everyone. shikamaru, you're amazing, after all. you did a jutsu on grownup ninja. are you some kind of genius. nope. he's still wet behind the ears. shucks. don't move. anyone who threatens the welfare of the village will be treated harshly, even if they are children. he could be a spy. you've gotta be joking. yota isn't. yota isn't like that. yota is.the first friend. i've ever had. friend. yeah. my friend.. yota. run. this river is deep. but we have to cross it. they're probably coming after us already. if only we could walk on water. we have to do it. let's go someplace where yota can be free. naruto.  choji.  choji.  shikamaru.  shikamaru.  yota.  yota. yota. yota. thank you. yota..  yota. yota.  yota.  yota.  yota. yota. yota.  yota.  yota. yota. yota. yota. get a grip, yota. yota. it's all right now. yota. come on, wake up. thank goodness, everyone. it's okay now. no, you're the one who's okay. snap out of it, yota. i'm already. no, yota. i'm sorry, if i hadn't been so reckless. it's my fault. we should've tried a different way. yota. yota. i'm so sorry. it's time for me to go. what're you talking about.. from now on, we're. i'll never forget about you guys. but you guys, forget about me. don't be ridiculous. how can we forget you..  yeah, he's right.  it's true, yota. you have to forget. otherwise.it will be painful. yota, i'm. yo.ta. and so we forgot about yota. about all the fun we had. that we were all friends. and i was alone once again. i never wanted to forget. if i were to forget you. i'd rather live with the guilt of letting you die.. yota, do i have to. make you suffer one more time.. how can i bear that.. that's. naruto. it's me. yota. yota. it's our secret tin can telephone. just between you and me. whoever is controlling him won't be able to hear us. naruto. that voice inside your head. yota.  yota.  yota. it's yota. sakura. shikamaru. ino. choji. kiba. akamaru. i'm sorry. i'm sorry. i'm so sorry. why are you apologizing. we couldn't save you. we let you die. that's why everyone's. naruto. everyone. don't worry yourselves over that. because when i met you guys, i was already dead. i was reanimated, then i met you guys. i was already dead. weather for sale i was born into a clan that distance: 2. 44 miles possessed the strange ability to control weather. we went from village to village. selling weather was our trade. even in my clan. i was especially good at controlling the weather. but i was born very weak. and i died. i died, but.i wasn't allowed to die. yota. be useful now. the snake.and the glasses fellow. they said they were testing reanimation and. they left me in your village, naruto. i was.so sad. yota. yota. we're so sorry we couldn't stay with you. oh no, don't be sorry. you know, it was so tough when i was alive. i was always alone, no matter where i went. but after i died, i wasn't alone anymore. i met all of you. and it was so much fun. i was resurrected at that river once more. and i had to live alone all over again, although i was dead. but i had my memories of all of you, so it wasn't hard. and it's too bad it had to be this way. but i got to see you again. you've grown up so much, naruto. you too, sakura. and shikamaru. ino too.and choji. kiba and akamaru, you look like you're doing well. yota. so let's have more fun. who cares about reanimation.. it'll be like old times. all together. we'll be happy, and mad, and sad, and have fun. what.is this.. kon kon kon. kon kon kon. i'm so happy. i'm having fun. yota. naruto. everyone. thank you. i'm going to go while i'm still happy. now this time, don't forget me. i want you to remember me. no, yota. i have no regrets now. i can really die now. byebye, naruto. everyone. i hope tomorrow is a sunny day. yota.. i didn't expect to lose this many of my pawns. so then, what's my next move. maybe i'll stir things up on the battlefield. to think i'd have to resort to sending in you guys as well. but i think you'll be useful in taking back the powerful pieces that i've lost. next time on naruto shippuden: "the reanimated allied forces" that's what you sacrificial pieces are for. tune in again. )
