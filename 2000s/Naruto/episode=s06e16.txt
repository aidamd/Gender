visual jutsu the rinnegan. the sage of the six paths, said to be the father of all ninja it is said that the sage possessing the rinnegan eye developed all the jutsu known to us today. rumored to always appear when the world becomes corrupt, capable of being both a godlike force of creation and an allobliterating instrument of destruction. i always believed it as a mere legend. but here is

stronger than you, yahiko. i'm gonna train starting now and i'll become stronger. you always exaggerate, konan. all right, let's start. the first lesson is on molding chakra. yes, sensei. yes, sensei. something's bothering you, eh. talk to me. sensei is it about that incident. that day when that man hurt yahiko, i was so mad at him. everything went blank in my head i didn't know what i was doing. before i realized it, the man was dead after that, i got so scared. this hatred made me lose myself and i killed someone. what i did was wrong. there had to be a better way. nagato i really don't know if it was right or wrong. but thanks to you, yahiko didn't die. you protected your friend. that had to be the right thing to do. no one can blame you for that. when you are hurt, you learn to hate. on the other hand, when you hurt someone, you are resented. but you start to feel guilty as well. understanding such pain enables you to be kind to others that's what makes us human. what do you mean by that. it's called growing up. growing up. what do you mean. that, you need to figure out yourself. konan and i were crying because we were so hungry and yahiko saved us. he stole food from others to feed us. i just want to protect those two. no matter what kind of pain i have to endure. i see.
