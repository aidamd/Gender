naruto. i you'll be fine. thank you. what's the matter, naruto. sorry, captain yamato. would you mind going on ahead without me. i'm returning to that village. return. something keepsbothering me. i can't help but think about the way those villagers looked at her. wait, naruto. damn, i have a bad feeling about this. you must be exhausted after your long journey, hotaru. come umm follow me. what is the chief thinking. does he really intend to shelter her here. you've got to be kidding. if something happens, we'll gethush. you talk too much. should i have not come back. of course not. you're finally home. you must get some rest. thank you. well then we finally meet the granddaughter of en no gyoja. who's there.. we knew you would rely on this village. you're the ones who attacked the fort. someone, help. bandits. uncle, please open the door. uncle. somebody. it's useless. now, hand over the forbidden jutsu. no. don't give us trouble. hey, hey be more gentle when handling a lady. you should talk. bro. so this is the hidden jutsu in question so it was rigged, eh. sassy kid after her. don't let her get away. to think they had already taken steps in the tsuchigumo village i have to get away from here. so she ran into the forest found you, girlie. water style: raging waves. don't let a petty jutsu like that bring you down, chushin. shut up. she just caught me by surprise, is all. playtime is over. tell me. where is the forbidden jutsu. what a pain. i'd talk now if i were you. benten might look like a girl, but he's scary when he's mad. i won't talk. that is my people's last hope. geez this is getting ridiculous. if you don't want to talk, i'll help you get into the mood. don't kill her. that's all up to her. what.. what's all this racket. can't a guy even take a nap. sir utakata. you. you're still alive. we got you back there for sure. well, sorry to disappoint you. it's not like i wanna fight you guys but i have business with her too. the successor's wish what. she's gone.. what's up with that.. i'm not sure myself. this is where i hid hotaru. then there was a loud noise and when i rushed over, she was all right. i'll help you find her. tell me where you've searched already. well, um we haven't started the search yet. what.. why didn't you search for her immediately. judging by the damage, it's obvious something happened. yesbut what's wrong with you.. isn't she one of your people.. enough, naruto. yelling won't help. captain yamato. what are you doing here. we were also worried, so we rushed back. it seems we were right. when did you last see her. just a while ago. after you brought hotaru here, i showed her to this room. then not much time has passed. let's hurry, naruto. but her safety is our main concern right now. sir utakata, you came to save me. that's not quite the case, but we'd better do something here. what's with this guy. i thought our jutsu hit him that time. are you scheming to steal our treasure away from us. i won't let you. acid flower. nango, come back. oh it missed. why you. surround him. we'll bring him down this time. he's outside our formation. so long. not so fast. sir utakata. he's fast. they can't have gone far. let's go after them. forget it. boss. why. are you just gonna let our treasure get away. this is the mist's bingo book. we've stumbled across a very interesting guy. meaning his head's worth enough to be in this book. wow 50 million ryo. we're in luck. the girl's jutsu is worth a fortune, and now this. we'll be rolling in money. but with a bounty this high, he's bound to be a formidable foe. hah. don't get cold feet now. this is our big chance. what. i'm just hey. pipe down. so what'll we do, boss. let's see it's my fault. i i should've returned right away. can i ask you a question. our mission was to protect the girl until she reached tsuchigumo village safely, right. that was supposed to be it. but if we can't completely guarantee that she's safe, the mission had no meaning. this mission is based on a treaty which was drawn up by the third hokage and en no gyoja of the tsuchigumo clan. so if the current tsuchigumo clan cannot protect her, then it's our job to do so. sai, can you scan the entire area and search for her. understood. ninja art: super beast scroll. hold on we'll find you for sure. sir utakata, where are we. wow so high. this should be good. i thought i was done for. you are amazing, after all. don't get me wrong. i didn't mean to save you. then why did you come. well let's just say i became curious about this forbidden jutsu those guys seem to want so badly. you're lying. you're not like that. never can tell. there's not a person in the world who doesn't love the smell of money. don't pretend to be a villain. you have a knack for putting me off balance. but what will you do now. those guys aren't the only ones who'll target that jutsu. others are bound to turn up. you're right. that's why i must get stronger. that's why i want to become your stustop right there. i'm not listening. besides, this keepsake of your grandfather or whatever why are you so determined to protect it. well it's to honor the wishes of my master. grandfather was also my first master. a master and student must be one in thought. that's why i want to fulfill the dream that my grandfather could not. in order to restore the tsuchigumo clan, i cannot lose this jutsu. hmph one in thought. such a stupid delusion. where are you going. i'm under no obligation to stick around. if you wanna play master and student, go somewhere else. it's not play. i'm serious about you. i want to call you my master. you can't stop me, you know. i know that. but my feelings won't change. huh.. iidiot. what're you doing.. i want you to see me everything about me. hotaruyou how could they. no one knows about this but i didn't want to hide it from you. please, sir utakata i don't say it. damn it. hidden jutsu: kirisame. shoot. as i thought this rain is kirisame utakata. there is no escape for you now. what's going on. we cannot keep the village waiting any longer. you guys sure are persistent. stay back, hotaru. water style: water whip. hotaru. i'll say it once more. cease resisting and come with us. if you try anything, this girl will die. sir utakata let me make it clear that she is nothing to me. i couldn't care less what happens. i see. we'll see about that. i see that worked. now return to the village with us. no matter how many times you ask, the answer will be the same. then we have no choice. lightning style: earth flash. sir utakata. don't take this personally. we absolutely must take him back to our village. such cruelty please stop. this isn't enough to kill him. i'm just restricting a little of his strength. stop it. just what did sir utakata do anyway.. utakata is a heinous criminal who killed his master and escaped from the village. we need to tie him up. get started. yes sir. yes sir. rasengan. what.. what's going on. you guys are pretty rotten, taking a hostage. naruto. sorry to keep you waiting. let her go, bastards. wait, naruto. why are you stopping me.. those masks they're tracking ninjas. they're not after hotaru. it's utakata. he's a rogue ninja listed in the hidden mist's bingo book. next time on naruto shippuden: "rogue ninja's past" what's his story. man, did i eat. winters are made for hotpots. the chinese cabbage tasted great. okay time for ramen. huh. huh.. a cockroach. there. what're you doing.. every living creature has a soul. don't kill recklessly. besides, it appeared because this room isn't clean, and that's the owner's fault. uh but we can't just let it run around. true they say that wherever there's one, there's a hundred more somewhere. fine. i'll handle this then. i'm going to use my beetlesummoning hidden jutsu and return them to the forest. okay, then get right to it. fine. hidden jutsu. beetlesummoning. tune in again. )
