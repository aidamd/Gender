the tumultuous journey elder brother has changed. if he's just strict all the time, i feel like he's going to alienate everyone. oh, there you are. i was looking for you, ashura. are you done with training today. well, since elder brother's going to take over ninshu, it doesn't matter if i slack off a bit. hmm. i see. well, it's less pressure on me. so, what's up. oh, oh. i need a favor. can you use ninshu to knock down a few trees around here. huh. why. ah.well if we clear a path through here, we'll have a shortcut to the fields. it will be easier on my mom. .and it's no big deal for you, right. is that all. leave it to me. will this do. yeah, you've been a big help. this kind of thing is easy. taizo. elder brother. what is the meaning of this. this man has committed a crime. he took down the trees, treating them as if they were his property. what's in this village belongs to everyone. that is the law. you are just as guilty, ashura. huh. me too. you were gullible. this man deceived you and made you an accomplice to his crime. was clearing a path, a lie. my mom was sick and needed medicine quickly. i'm sorry i got you involved, ashura. why didn't you tell me the truth. i could've used ninshu if she was sick. mom hates ninshu. she says this world doesn't need ninshu. whether you believe in ninshu or not, a law is a law. ashura. you didn't know anything about this. so just this once, you will be forgiven. indra, perhaps you are taking this too far. everyone makes mistakes. judging people requires prudence. i know that, father. however, when a crime is committed, proper punishment must be carried out. only then, will it act as a deterrent against future crimes. elder brother. ashura. i'll let you out in a moment. but. it's okay. i'll take full responsibility for this. elder brother. ashura, what do you think you're doing with that man. please overlook this, elder brother. he didn't do this with malicious intent. the law is the law. haven't you already made an example of him. that's not for you to decide. i'll convince my brother somehow. go now. thanks, ashura. if you're going to break the law, you can take the punishment instead. stop, elder brother. ashura, why do we have laws. what is the purpose of ninshu's power. if you can't answer these questions yourself, then you should obey me. calm yourself. elder brother. shiro father. today's the day shiro died. back then, if shiro and elder brother weren't there, i would have died. shiro i'm alive, thanks to everyone's strength. you possess a gentle heart. the complete opposite of indra. well, elder brother is extraordinary. he can do anything by himself, and he has the power to do so. that is precisely why. what do you think of indra's eyes. what do i think. well, i do feel a bit intimidated by them. as i thought. indra's visual prowess would not work with ashura. is something the matter. there's something ominous about indra's eyes that even i cannot fathom. looking into his eyes makes me remember. my mother's eyes. perhaps elder brother can see things that others cannot see. such as. something very advanced. like the ideal version of ninshu, or the future. i don't know since i don't have the sharingan. but back then, when he and shiro saved me, elder brother was very kind. i have faith that elder brother's heart has not changed from those days. i'll train harder and do my best to become someone that elder brother can rely on. at that moment, i felt i understood for the first time, why heaven had blessed me with two sons. that was. hey, did you hear. lord hagoromo is finally going to name his successor. master indra or master ashura. which will it be. there's no doubt, it's got to be the elder one, master indra. he excels in ninshu. and now, i am going to pick my successor to ninshu. father, what is this. during the battle where i sealed away my mother, parts of the ten tails were scattered throughout the world. we repaired most of the lands during our journeys. but in that scroll, it is written that there are two regions, which still need to be fixed. indra, ashura. you will each go to these lands and settle whatever problem has occurred there. and after i see your results, i will decide to whom i will entrust ninshu. llord hagoromo. why, father.. why are you doing this. i don't have the skill to inherit ninshu. in fact, i have no desire to inherit ninshu. i'm more than happy just helping elder brother. that is for me to decide. what will the two of you do when you are out in the world. when i see what comes out of that, everything will fall into place. why did father decide to do this. don't worry. father will come to understand quickly. uhhuh. the younger one seems to have matured into a kind and gentle soul. but the older one inherited the power of the sharingan, huh. but out of consideration for his older brother, the younger one might not return home. i will deal with that when the time comes. what is it that you want to test. it's not a test or anything. the eldest excels, but due to his power, he does not have faith in love. the younger one doesn't have the skill, but overflows with love. ninshu will come to exert enormous influence in this world. in order for ninshu to take the true and proper path. both power and love are necessary. i want my sons to grow during their journeys. and learn to nurture ninshu together. enough already. just come out. you knew i was there. are you all right. yeah, as you can see. thanks for what you did back then. don't mention it. so, what's up. after you helped me, i hid out in a shack on the hill in the back. then gasuka and edashi. big news. ashura is leaving on a journey. and that journey will determine who the successor of ninshu will be. after i heard that, i couldn't sit still. take me with you. but your mom's sick, isn't she. she's okay now. seems the medicine really worked. she's back to her lively self. so i told her about you, and she said i should go and help you. but doesn't your mom hate ninshu. so why. that and this are two different things. a man's obligation comes before hating ninshu. but.i won't be coming home for a while. what. really. i'm sure elder brother will pass this test with flying colors. and if i don't return, father will choose elder brother as his successor. i see. that's so like you. so then, where do you intend to go. what should i do. didn't your dad say there are people struggling where you're supposed to go. wouldn't it be bad if you didn't go to help them out. yeah, that's right. i guess i should just go, then figure things out later. yeah. let's do that. still. it's awfully far away. according to the map, we should be getting close. we're in trouble. we're out of water. don't worry. how can i not. you can't do water jutsu, can you. no. i can only do wind jutsu. well then. it's near. the divine tree. huh. i can sense it with my chakra. father once told me. ninshu chakra got its power from the divine tree. hey. looks like we made it. this is a surprise. to find a place so fertile right in the middle of such a barren area. how could a village like this be struggling like lord hagoromo mentioned. what's up. we're surrounded. what. who are you.. we're not suspicious characters. we're just travelers. we've had a lot of robbers lately who've been targeting our village. we are not robbers. please believe us. never mind. get 'em. taizo, get to the top of the tree. stop this. i have no intention of fighting. then leave this village now. hey, are you all right.. don't touch me. it's okay. i'll heal you. i just hope it works. that's amazing. what's all this ruckus about. lord elder. what a feast. we can really eat all of this. please don't hesitate, eat. i apologize for the rudeness earlier. don't worry about it. i must say it's a shock to see such a fertile patch in this barren land. this village is special. special. anyways, there's nothing much to do here. but please have a relaxing stay. you're up early, ashura. this is a wonderful place. the food and water taste great, and as luck would have it, the girl you saved is quite a beauty. there are no issues here. yes. but i still feel it. coming from over there. feel what. chakra. and the divine tree is there. probably. hey, where are you going. i'd like to go to that hill. you can't. the lord elder says no one is to go near there. oh, really. please leave. let's go, ashura. yeah. something's suspicious. maybe there is something, after all. you're the beauty from yesterday. perfect timing. we're planning on staying a bit in this village. so i'm hoping you can show us around. this is ashura and i'm tai. i'm kanna. are you a doctor. i'm not really a doctor. he knows ninshu. ninshu. oh, i see. so that's what it was. can you heal illnesses with that too. illness. come with me. where are we. a medical clinic. i want you to cure my mom's illness. mom. she's been unconscious for a long time. what is this. i sense a strong chakra. could this be from the divine tree. it's no good. i can't cure this sickness with my power. i'm sorry. i see. are they all like your mother. ashura, come here. these are graves, right. no wonder this place felt so creepy. this illness caused all these deaths. that's right. i have no choice, i have to go. you're. i'm sorry, but i'm going to need you go to sleep. what are you doing. umm. what were the visual prowess signs again. this way is much faster. there's a cave here. let's check it out. what is this place. i didn't image it would be like this inside. i've heard legends about the divine tree, but. this is. there's no doubt. this is the divine tree. that tree is the ruin of the specter that almost destroyed our world. i've been ordered to do something about it. the power of the divine tree is indeed making this land abundant, but it's also affecting the villagers adversely. next time on naruto shippuden: "ashura's decision" at any rate, i have to. ashura's decision tune in again. )
