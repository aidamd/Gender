night of the crescent moon i know how hard this is for you, yugao. even so, you're the one for this mission. sukui. it's cruel, i know. but in order to reduce the casualties on our side, we need as much intel on our enemy as possible. it might even help us save lives. now go, this is an order. you think she'll be all right. this is going to be unpleasant. they've erased their scent. having a sensorytype was smart. yugao, can you pinpoint the target. they've moved, detouring around the battleground to the forest up ahead at two o'clock. if we go around, we could confront them head on. you've improved. not bad, huh. i can get one out of two now. get real. it's more like one out of three. that's because you're a transparency style. but just you wait, i'll catch up in no time. then i just have to work harder so you can't. you're wide open. my mistake. i won't let you surpass me that easily. since i'm going to protect you. okay, before the fighting starts. we should know about who we're fighting. hayate gekko is an expert in the hidden leaf sword style. he specializes in the transparency jutsu. he's highly skilled. you want to avoid close combat. let's hurry. that was boring. i wanted to do more damage. are you kidding. i'm sick of being used like this. but we got to come back to life. we should enjoy ourselves, right. to meet again like this. but you could. hey, i'm talking to you. are you dissing me, you bastard.. they're coming. oh, i see. this is what it means to have a body that can't die. this is pretty convenient. don't talk too soon. a posse, eh. that's more like it. two left. i wish we could have stopped at least one more. that one disappeared quick. this is perfect though. let's share the prey, fiftyfifty. shadow clone jutsu. please take care of that one. right. you've come. get back. sorry, but you'll be going up against me. earth style: flying stones. you're mine. please get back. then return that scroll. what.. iou. you should pay attention. go after him too. i'm sorry. i'm now an enemy of the leaf. and your enemy as well. so i want you to stop me. i don't want to hurt you. please. yugao. take this. kill me, yugao. i can't. i just can't. if you don't. yugao. cha. that's all you got. you're the only one left. i have to go. wait. damn it. iou. this is.. please bear with the pain. i'm going to close the wound. iou can't continue on with the pursuit. that goes for you too. i'm sorry. it's my fault. no. but it was true then. that.you can't fight. i'm sorry. i always dreamed about becoming an anbu black ops, so i lost my head earlier. i'm going to get some water. where are you going. hayate hasn't changed his course. so you don't need my help in pursuing him. there's nothing i can do even if i remained. why did you leave the anbu black ops. hayate was my lover. at the time, we were training partners in the leaf sword style. we honed our skills together. there. impressive. the hokage himself certified my transparency style. well, with my sensory skills and swordsmanship, i was chosen for the anbu. but you're still lacking. i'm almost there. hayate. i suppose i should be happy that your strength has been acknowledged. but the missions are risky, far more dangerous than before. please, i want you to be careful. i heard that. members of the anbu black ops died at hidden leaf hospital.. i'll be fine. but. they were killed by kabuto yakushi. it seems he was orochimaru's spy. the one who was taking part in the chunin exam. he had us completely fooled. but going after sasuke doesn't explain their actions. without a doubt, they're up to no good. so we must learn more about their movements. it's too dangerous. he held his own against kakashi. but someone has to go. and with my tracking jutsu, i'm the ideal candidate. but. i'm off. hayate gekko has been killed.  what..  oh no. no. not hayate. he was found on the outskirts of kikyo castle. that's. the destruction of the leaf village happened a month later. hayate, i'll avenge you. it was my way of memorializing hayate. so i fought and i fought. but when the fighting ended. my emotions that had been stretched so thin.just snapped. i couldn't even hold a sword anymore. hayate and i were connected through fencing. inevitably, a sword reminds me of his death. yugao. how can i kill him. how can i go through his death all over again. still, i cannot let you go. and leave behind the injured. am i right. i understand a little of what you're going through. i couldn't fight the one i used to love. but you must see this through. sakura. kakashi sensei told us. "this jutsu is unforgivable. " to trample on a person's death. to trample on our memories of them. i feel the same way. don't you have to go. yokaze. i'm sorry if i'm being rude. but that person named hayate. seemed like he wanted you to stop him. yugao.. just call on me, hayate. and i'll come running. when things are really tough. if you need me, i promise to save you. then let's make a promise. with the moon as our witness. i swear to you, and you swear to me. that we will love each other above all else, and protect each other. i'll be fine. our reinforcements will be here shortly. please stop, hayate gekko. you're.sakura haruno, right. you've become a fine shinobi. i don't want to kill you. and i can't let you go. i can't let you have that scroll. i won't get into your line of attack. right there. where'd he go. please run away. yugao. i'm here. i'm sorry i'm late. thank you. i'll assist. no, call the sealing corps. killing him won't stop him. right.  dance of the crescent moon.  dance of the crescent moon. yugao. hayate. moonlit night. secret sword, tsukikage. like you said, you've gotten better. it wasn't for something like this. i regret. making that promise. you're wrong. i wondered what was taking so long. hurry up and do your work, will you. i'm being called. is he taking my consciousness too.. hayate. this is pitiful, but. i'm really doing my best. yugao. goodbye, yugao. the moon always changes shape. a promise made on something like that is bound to get distorted. that's how man sees the moon. whatever the shape or name, the moon will always be the moon. that will never change. yokaze and iou have been rescued. i see. that's good. yugao. in the end. he protected me. thank you.and. goodbye. hayate. so, who is he. it seems he's a reanimated samurai. he's really strong. samurai. retreat, you shinobi. old man. is that you, old man tatewaki. is that you, naruto. you were alive. next time on naruto shippuden: "an arank mission: the contest" tell me. what happened to those two. an arank mission: the contest tune in again. )
