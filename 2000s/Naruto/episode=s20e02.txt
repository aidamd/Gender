where tenten belongs mom, i'm going out. what. eat first. everything's ready. by the way, did you look at your dad's papers without permission. i know how interested you are, but you're not even a jonin yet. really. i guess they're not coming to get me today. that's not the kind of person you are. what was that all about. it's like they were making me the bad guy. no, no, no. how can i be swayed by a fake.. maybe it's proof that i'm being affected by this world. i have to return to my world. i hate having to ask someone, but i have no other choice. if anyone knows about genjutsu here, it has to be. now what brings you here. i have something to ask you. you know a lot about genjutsu, don't you, sensei. genjutsu. sensei. well, yes. i can't use genjutsu, but i just love that jutsu. huh. you can't use them. that's why i'm hooked on them and have collected all sorts of data about them. come in, come in. super secret scroll this is amazing. so what do you want to know. the most beautiful jutsu. the most majestic jutsu. or the most frightening one. i'm not into the crazy ones. what i want to know is how to undo them. oh, that's too bad. like when the usual release jutsu doesn't work. or when you can't expect help from your friends. that's very hard. that's possible if you're a grade above the jutsu user, but. i figured as much. what if you inflicted wounds on yourself. would the pain undo the jutsu. i can't recommend that either. there are genjutsu that inflicts pain over and over again. rather than undoing the jutsu, it would do so much damage, you'd end up being an invalid the instant you returned to the real world. i see. sir, i'd like a large plate of sesame dumplings please. sorry, we only have plain dumplings. i'll have that then. a large order. oh man, what more can i do.. i can't think of anything else. what's wrong. seems like you're in a bad temper as usual. i saw the commotion yesterday. you were the one fighting in the park, huh. oh. what happened. i'm looking for a way to undo a genjutsu placed by a higherranking shinobi. that's if there is a way. well, i heard something a while back. huh. seriously. when you travel around doing business, you hear a lot of things. as i recall, there's a shinobi who's skilled at that in the hidden rain village. here, this is a map of the hidden rain. you're letting me have it. maybe it was fate we met. anyway, use it. with your "shinobi legs," you'll get there in just a few days. that's what he says, but the hidden rain and the hidden leaf don't have an alliance. if i go there on a whim, i'll be branded as a deserter. but i have no choice. i've got to get home to everyone. where do you think you're going. they were waiting for me. why.. binding syrup. it's no use resisting. give up. but i can't believe you'd betray us. check her possessions. okay. hey. what're you talking about. oh, this too. give it back. give it back. i don't have a clue. don't pretend. we got intel long ago that the hidden rain was planning to attack the leaf. and, that the one helping them was lying low in the leaf. and just as we were tightening security, we were tipped off that you were acting strange. and even planning to desert. wait a minute. i know nothing about that. trying to deny it even though you had this. it's a secret missive addressed to the hidden rain. we'll get the rest out of you during questioning. take her away. right. wait. i know nothing about this. nothing. she was going to betray the village. how low can you get. i'm not a conspirator. even that map. it was him. he gave me the map to frame me. in fact, he must be planning something right now. i have to let them know. everyone. i misjudged you, you idiot. is this what you meant by not caring about the village anymore. that's enough, hinata. come on, pick up the pace. i guess their reaction is to be expected. damn it. these guys aren't my friends or anything. who cares what happens to this fake village. but they even took my scroll. what's going to happen to me. over here, tenten. lee.. are you okay, tenten. from the looks of it. you seem to be in a real dilemma. i wasn't peeking. neji, restrain yourself. if we're discovered, there'll be hell to pay. yeah, sorry. you guys. why. sorry about earlier. if we defended you publicly, it would've made coming to see you difficult. why are you here. well, we couldn't ignore a comrade who's in trouble. we believe in you. first and foremost, we wanted to tell you that. i said you weren't my friends. as if we'd believe something so arbitrary. how long have we been together. yeah, it's been every single day since we graduated from the academy. you wanted to become a shinobi like lady tsunade, one of the legendary sannin. neji wanted to change destiny. and i wanted to prove that i can be a supercool shinobi even if i can't do ninjutsu. every day, even if there's wind, rain, storm or snow. on our birthdays, at new year's, during summer and christmas. we three kept at it earnestly under guy sensei's overthetop guidance. and never, ever gave up. tenten. it's nothing. it's true, to guy sensei everything is a training exercise. yeah, he's a real nuisance. guy sensei is a nice grownup. he's really cool.  you sure about that.  yes, he is cool. it feels strange, having this conversation in here in this world. maybe even in a fake world, our feelings can be true. lee, the guards will be making their rounds soon. we'll catch the real culprit. wait. the man who tricked me is disguised as a merchant. but be careful. i'm sure he'll use this incident to cause some trouble. got it. we'll warn everyone. good luck.i guess.  it's an attack.  we're under attack. damn it. where did you come from. you scum. are you all right, lady hinata. why did they attack so suddenly. i thought the spying was done. hinata, look. a summoning formula. so they're set up here and there to summon the enemy, huh. damn it. are lee and the others okay. him. why are you. i knew all about this thanks to intel that my dad received. ever since you started acting strange, i've been secretly watching over you. i didn't notice you at all. but the whole time i was watching, you did nothing but research genjutsu. and when you were caught. i concluded that he was the real conspirator. i wanted to put an end to it before it came to this. but they activated the jutsu formula. this is. it's important to you, right. on the way here, i spoke to the higherups about the conspirator. so, you're free to go. why. i might desert the village again. to be honest, i can't figure you out. i don't know how to put it. i feel like you're tenten, but not the tenten i know. and you keep talking about "going home" and i think your home is located somewhere far away from this world. what was that. menma, can you hear me. lee.. hurry. get out of here. a giant summoning beast is going wild near the academy. everyone's trying to fight it off, but at this rate. we need your help right away. all right. i have to go. you should return to where you belong. it's true. i'm not from here. i want to save everyone, and i want to go home quickly. i thought i didn't care about this world. but. .let me go with you. i'm sure i can help. super expansion jutsu. you.. choji. tenten. what are you doing here.. i've been cleared. i'm going to fight too. that's more like it. fine. let's stop this thing. your fighting spirit is commendable, but this is where i come in. menma. i knew you'd come. everyone, get back. right. the leaf's tailed beast.. that's amazing. that's menma for you. go, menma. take it down. it ends here. the hidden leaf will be destroyed. what happened. no way. we can't stop another one. if it gets any closer. i'll take it from here. what are you saying. you can't handle that thing. we have to move back or the flames will get us. please run away, tenten. no, i won't run. i've made up my mind. i won't let it run wild. i'm going to save everyone. what you did was amazing. i can't believe you took on such a powerful enemy and stopped it cold. you're the top weapons handler of our day. when it comes to using ninja tools, no one comes close to you. i thought we were goners. thank you for protecting us. i wanted to do this. yes, it's just as i had hoped. i was able to protect everyone, and the world with my power. but.is this really okay. it's okay. the fact that i'm alive and that the world is safe. is all thanks to you. oh.okay. let's celebrate. tenten has come home.  welcome home.  i'm so glad you're back.  this is great.  we can't do anything without you. i'm home. a jinchuriki, all alone. a jinchuriki, just a brat, so forlorn. lord killer bee is here to save you, yeah. killer bee. it was you. you spilled my instant ramen. next time on naruto shippuden: "killer bee rappuden: part 1" you can eat as much ramen as you want after we get out of here. killer bee rappuden: part one tune in again. )
