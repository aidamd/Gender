morale is high and everyone is ready to move into action as soon as the order is given. good. all right. we can't just stand around either. moegi, udon. let's go.  now, udon.  right. fire style. burning ash. hey, konohamaru. you're overdoing it. listen up. the village is getting ready for war. we have to be ready to answer the call to arms at any time too. we're still genin, so i doubt that we'll get to battle right away. besides, aren't there still things that kids like us have to do. how can you be so relaxed. we've made progress since then. we have to distinguish ourselves and become the heroes of this village. naruto's favorite student anyway, the time has come for us to achieve great things for our village. but konohamaru, how are we gonna do that. yeah, it's easier said than done. how can we. that's it. the leaf news. what do you mean. say, i'm from leaf news. we're going to collect data about the impending war. during the last incident, we helped everyone evacuate. is there anything else that we can do. there sure is. hold out your hands. there. okay, carry those. thanks a lot. that was a big help. sakura, please wait. you didn't tell us what we can do to help in the war. we want to do something for the sake of the village. yeah. you're already doing something for the sake for the village. this box contains medicine to be used by the ninja who will be fighting on the front lines. not like that. we want to do something bigger like the kind of stuff big brother naruto does, you know. what are you saying. war is not playtime. many people will get hurt and they may die. don't speak so lightly of distinguishing yourselves. man. looking down on us just because we're genin. but what big sister sakura said is true. i guess we should just. don't give up so easily. what's the matter. you look kind of upset. big brother shikamaru. what do we have to do to get on the front lines and fight the akatsuki. i brought down pain. i'm a fullfledged leaf ninja now. well then, i have a question for you, fullfledged leaf ninja. define the king that you feel you must protect. "king". if you don't know the meaning of what i'm asking, then i cannot acknowledge you as a fullfledged hidden leaf ninja. here i go, talking big. actually, i learned the answer just recently myself. anyway, there's no need to push yourself so hard. i'll hear you out again sometime. here. ball. what does "ball" mean. you're so dumb. i wish everyone would stop giving us the run around. all right then. what are you going to do. who are we going to interview next. we're not going to interview anyone. we're going to demand that we be allowed to take part in the war. you fool. why.. i want to fight for our village on the front lines. there is no place for you there. i brought down pain by myself. i am fully qualified to fight on the frontlines. you are interfering with my work. get out. konohamaru. are you okay.. damn it. why.. nawaki, happy twelfth birthday. big sister, is this. yes. it's the first hokage's, our grandfather's, necklace. i love you, big sister. damn it. oh, someone is coming. we'll get yelled at. this way. lady hokage is expecting you. right. hey, that's. temari, the older sister to the kazekage of the hidden sand village. kazekage. i have a good idea. what're you thinking. this is a secret letter from the kazekage to you. yes, thank you. i confirm that i have received it from you. what a long way for you to come during such a hectic time, just to deliver this. not at all. i wanted to personally assess the situation in hidden leaf village, a member of the alliance. it's been a while, hasn't it. the shadows of the past are gone, but please stay and rest. thank you, but i must hurry back to the village. please excuse me. brother shikamaru. what is it. did you figure out the meaning of "king".  konohamaru's in trouble.  konohamaru is. he's. what's wrong. sand hidden sand jonin temari. you will accept my challenge. move or you'll get hurt. i wonder which one of us will get hurt. my name is konohamaru sarutobi. grandson of the third hokage, big brother naruto's favorite student. naruto's. running away from this challenge will mean that you fear me. say that again, you brat. here i come. fire style. burning ash. first star. how'd you do that. hey, kid. you're just talk, aren't you. i'm not a kid. i'm konohamaru. kunai knives. shadow clone jutsu. second star. it seems the sarutobi clan doesn't have a decent heir left. i have no choice. multi shadow clone jutsu. here i go. third star. that's enough. you're a hundred years away from challenging me. you said you were naruto's favorite student. what a disappointment. well, i shouldn't have expected a guy like naruto to have a decent student. good job, konohamaru. you're a hero in our village too. i don't care what you say about me. but i won't let you say anything bad about big brother naruto. what.. what is that.  rasengan.  ninja art. wind scythe shadow strangle jutsu. what. what is this. the jutsu passed on by naruto himself. the rasengan. that brat mastered a jutsu this powerful. konohamaru. are you all right, konohamaru. damn it. what are you doing.. if you had let me finish completing the rasengan, i'd have won. what was that for.. because. because you keep talking about distinguishing yourself and winning, konohamaru. it's like you're happy that war is coming. that's not. konohamaru. remember that day. that day, i got separated from you, so i headed towards district c. then. mommy, help me. he's in danger. i have to get help. i'm the only one around. i have to help him. i have to help him. sota. mommy. sota. fighting in a war isn't the only way to help the village. when war breaks out, all the jonin and chunin won't be in the village. what if the enemy attacks us. then what. that's right. we have to take the place of those who are on the battlefield and protect the elderly and the children in the village. define the king that you feel you must protect. i swear i'm gonna protect them. all the grandmas and the grandpas, and the children. protecting the village is a huge responsibility too. but boy, were you lucky. if you had kept fighting, you'd have fallen to temari's wind scythe jutsu. among all the kunoichi, she's known as the cruelest one. still, you're something else, pushing me to that limit. ii.i. i will report to gaara that fine young ones are coming up among the hidden leaf. in a few years, i'm sure you'll be a good shinobi. konohamaru. what'll we do from now. what else. this village is grandpa's, the third hokage's, treasure. so i'm gonna protect it. because i'm the grandson of the third hokage, who protected the village hidden in the leaves. and because big brother naruto promised me that one day, we'd fight for the title of the hokage. i'm gonna train more until i can pulverize big brother naruto. because becoming the hokage is my dream. is that what konohamaru said. i'm certain of it. i see. so konohamaru said that, huh. not just this necklace. this village is grandfather's treasure. so i'm going to protect it. because i'm the grandson of the first hokage, who founded the village hidden in the leaves. such big talk. remember, men don't go back on their word. i know. i'm gonna become like grandfather and take on the title of hokage one day.  'cause becoming the hokage is my dream.  'cause becoming the hokage is my dream. i wonder how he's doing. getting a marriage proposal so quickly like that. naruto, you're really popular. it's nothing like that. just because pervy sage made some careless promise, i'm paying for it now. well, we are heading to a secret a mission, so getting involved in any foolish disturbances will be problematic. we should avoid any unnecessary trouble. we should rest early and leave first thing in the morning. next time: "the kunoichi of nadeshiko village" don't. stop chasing me. tune in again. )
