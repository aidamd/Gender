the small fry can stay out of this. all right. come at me, kakashi. breaking the crystal style hide my face, but not my butt. i'm a schoolgirl in love with her senpai. ooh. hey senpai. are you still angry. let's be friends and look for threetail's together. get lost. but if we don't get to work, the others will chew us out. please give me a break. i know. i'll let you take a special peek inside the mask. i said get lost. oh senpai. i just might go somewhere for real if you say it like that. i have no choice i'll go search by myself for a while. so this is the power she kept hidden so persistent and when your ink drawing doesn't work, you run away is that your ninja art. there are other uses for my ink. what. ninja art: ink flush. what's the matter. come at me. i'm fed up when we last fought, she didn't release all her power. the next one's for real. crystal style: burst crystal falling dragon. wha.. die. she can turn anything she touches into crystal. in other words, water, earth nor wood styles have any effect. howeverthis will. did i do it. so nave too bad, kakashi. the threetailed dragon was just a diversion to keep me here for all the talk i've heard, your sharingan isn't much. well now, playtime is over. it's useless. now then, where is it, where is it. actually, where should i go huh. i've discovered an awfully suspicious lake. hmm. what're they doing anyway. they're from the hidden leaf hhey. ino focus on the chakra for the barrier. rright. barrier. hey no way that's impossible. huh. oh my there's another one but i've never seen him before. the hidden leaf are looking for threetails. oh well i guess i'll just sit back and watch. okay, let's settle this. kakashi sensei. prepare to die. what.. oh. shino. just in the nick of time. are they ready. if they weren't, i wouldn't have come. humph if it isn't the insect user. your jutsu is useless against me. it's useless. didn't i tell you. it's useless. i wonder about that what.. it can't be. your jutsu won't work against me. and that's because my insects can evolve limitlessly. they are now resistant to your jutsu. yes, you did it. that's amazing. that's impossible my crystal style can't be defeated multi shadow clone jutsu. i won't let you get away now. stay still. where is yuukimaru.. why do you.. you want that boy's power too. i don't need anything like that. i wonder about that now. her crystal style has been sealed. tell us. where is yuukimaru.. why you. this is. guren this ismud. it seems that crystal mends itself right away. damn it. there's no end to this. focus the insects' attack on one spot. guren i can't keep up. lightning blade. a mud wall.. gozu.. gozu, you what're you doing.. let go. i'm going to kill them. gozu. i won't let you through. guren. are you all right, kakashi sensei.. yeah but guren got away. she was the key to finding yuukimaru. it's regrettable my insects performed flawlessly, yet she got away all right, we'll split up and search. naruto, you go with shino. sai, come with me. you said that they were formidable, so i was burning with the desire to fight what was that. they were so easy to beat. yup they were so different from the last time. are you real sure about these next guys. don't let your guard down. yyes. kakashi senpai had his hands full with her. the crystal style user is no joke. i'd love to face her in battle to see if my taijutsu is effective against her. let's split up into two groups here. lee and tenten will guard the sealing team by the lake. and we will join up with senpai's team who are battling the crystal style user. huh. i won't be able to fight the crystal style user. we don't know where the enemy may appear. i just told you not to let your guard down. yyes. yes. search huh.. just now. i know it's close directly below us it's finally come we are switching from the "search" mode of the fourcorner sealing barrier. keep your breathing soft and steady. fourcorner sealing barrier: bind. fourcorner sealing barrier: bind. bind we'll quietly sink the net. do not let the threetails detect us. oh no, senpai. it is the three tails, after all. right, he's not here does he intend to stop them. the enemy. concentrate. but. leaf hurricane. what.. lee. tenten. we've taken care of the enemy on that side, so we rushed over. i'm glad we made it in time. now that i'm here, i won't allow you to lay a finger on these four. there should've been others to stop you oh, them they were no match for us. damn so kigiri and the others were beaten now then, i am your opponent. what. running away.. uhoh this is bad. real bad. at this rate, the threetails will be sealed. but if i go out now, i might lose. i'm outnumbered. right, senpai. and he's not here humph useless, the whole lot of them. the hidden leaf ritual aims to seal the threetails. they've chosen a path which will prevent anyone from using the threetails. but i won't allow that. yuukimaru. guren no the white camellia cannot become a red one. you promisedthat you'll come back. gozu you yuukimaru. no. this grass whistle no way no way it's impossible did i kill that boy's mother.. that's that's. we must go. you.. i thought you returned to lord orochimaru. there's something more pressing. the hidden leaf has started to seal the threetails. what. we'll use yuukimaru to control the threetails. and we'll destroy their barrier. kabuto, i need to talk to you. what, at a time like this. i know that. but you of all people should know what would happen if we make yuukimaru use his powers any further huh. is that all. tell me the truth. why're you so upset. it's none of your business whether yuukimaru lives or dies. it ismy business. oh. so even the devil sheds tears. to think that you, who have killed countless people, would have a soft spot for yuukimaru. now that is a surprise. he's special because you killed his mother. how did you. there's nothing unusual about that. it's as lord orochimaru predicted. he knew that you would have feelings for the boy. that's exactly why he chose you. if you like, i can tell yuukimaru for you that the kind, gentle guren whom he believes is the one he should return to is the evil villain who killed his mother stop. then, carry out my orders. tenten we don't know when the enemy will appear again. please stay alert. you endeared him to you very skillfully lord orochimaru i hate to admit it, but you were right to select that woman guren will grow to love yuukimaru. is that even possible. kabuto, you have much to learn. the more time you spend with someone, the stronger the bond becomes. that is human nature. is that so. those two their ties go deep indeed. it's likely that guren will disobey my order and betray me. then i guess that time has come lord orochimaru sai, how is it. still no reaction to the crystal style user. she used up considerable chakra during that last battle. now is the time to strike. i don't want to give her too much time. i agree. i'm going to widen the scope of my search. damn it. where'd she disappear to.. naruto, patience is the key. i know. but the boy i'll find him for sure. next time: "the battle over the barrier" tune in again. )
