my chakra is reacting strongly. what's that. it's what was growing on the sick people. i see. the sap from the divine tree's seeped into the soil. the sap acts like a fertilizer, making this area a lush oasis in the middle of such a barren region. the power of the divine tree is making the land fertile. so.is the divine tree getting its power back. no, it hasn't completely revived. but it probably will eventually. but the real problem is. is what. the people are becoming contaminated first. contaminated.. the people and animals eat the produce grown on this land, which accumulates the sap of the divine tree. so does that mean. if you eat the food here, you're gonna get sick. probably. but i ate so much yesterday. it's all right. my jutsu can take care of a small amount. but if you keep ingesting and accumulating it for many years. since the village elder ordered for this place to be under watch, does that means he knows everything. so it seems. ashura's decision i see. you saw the divine tree. yes. traveler, why do you keep digging for our village secrets. forgive me. i'm from the village of ninshu and was told to come here. ninshu. the ninshu that destroyed the land 20 years ago. you are a pupil. yes. that tree is the ruin of the specter that almost destroyed our world. that is why it's so powerful. i've been ordered to do something about it. lord elder, to be blunt, that tree is a narcotic. the power of the divine tree is indeed making this land abundant, but it's also affecting the villagers adversely. at this rate. traveler, i am already aware of that. but i cannot authorize that tree's destruction. why is that. that tree started to grow powerfully several decades ago. until then, this was arid and barren land. we had terrible droughts nearly every year. i've lost count of how many died of starvation. why don't you try digging a well. it was futile. "was". we tried ages ago. one could dig for years, only to hit the solid bedrock that runs across this land. if we cut down that tree now, what will happen to us. i cannot tell the villagers that we will be returning to those days of hunger and suffering. besides, even if i told them the truth, the villagers will not believe me. traveler, do not get involved any further. it would be best if you leave as soon as possible. kanna, how do you feel. about what. in time, you will become infected by the divine tree. and. we have no other choice. there's nowhere else for us to go. we just have to endure and live with it. please listen, everyone. do you know the truth behind the divine tree. hey, ashura. the divine tree is the ruins of a specter. the divine tree is the cause of the illness afflicting the people at the clinic. if you continue to rely on the power of the divine tree, you will all fall victim to the same illness. are you okay with that.. everyone. don't listen to this guy. these two came from the village of ninshu. they ravaged the world, and now, they want to take the divine tree from us. we can't let them do that. get out of here. what do you think would happen to us if the divine tree was gone.. get lost. ashura, let's get out of here. i hope masters indra and ashura are all right. brother, what kind of places did you send those two. simply put, villages burdened with the same problem. i want to know how they resolve it. i see. be honest, have you already decided which one will succeed you. no, i haven't decided. indra's abilities are extraordinary, but he is too quick to try to resolve everything by himself. ashura is truly kind towards people, but hesitates to take the lead. if this trip helps them mature and learn to support each other, i would have no complaints. gamamaru, have you had a new dream. about their futures. if i did have a dream, would you want me to tell you. that would be cheating. you must name your successor by yourself. well then, i guess i'll be leaving. gamamaru, i hope you're not planning on visiting them. don't interfere. i won't. i doubt you all will ever be able to reach a decision. come on ashura, let's go. let's just go and have a carefree journey. uhhuh. if you're that concerned, just sneak over there and destroy the tree. you have the power to do that, don't you. but then, the villagers will. they'll suffer sure, but they're going to die eventually. oh yeah. father didn't say to destroy the divine tree. huh. indra. ashura. you will each go to these lands and settle whatever problem has occurred there. father said to resolve the problem. hey, hey. i hope you're not getting any weird ideas. to resolve the problem. there's no other way but to dig a well. are you serious. you heard the old man. there's solid bedrock and you can't dig a well. yes. but that time, father said. the power of ninshu, which you have inherited. there is no handbook for its use. only you can decide how to use it. it's up to us. i've decided. i'm going to do what i believe is right. huh. even if it takes me years. it's master indra. master indra has returned. leave it to master indra. he's back already. i'm glad to see you well. where is ashura. he's not back yet. i see. is that. don't tell me he's.. ashura. oh, kanna. what are you doing.. can't you tell. i'm digging a well. are you serious. yes. if you have water, you won't have to rely on the divine tree. that's impossible. the villagers have tried digging for years. and they've never found water. i already told him that. but once he gets an idea, he just won't listen. it doesn't matter whether it's possible or not. i've decided to do it. see you, kanna. are you two.stupid. i might be. but he definitely is. even if it takes years, i'll make it happen. i've returned. welcome back. how did it go. i did exactly as i was told. were there any problems. no. peace has returned to the village. lord hagoromo. master indra has returned first. which means the successor of ninshu is. no, i'm not interested in how fast things were resolved. i will wait for ashura to return. then i will decide. is that all right, indra. yes. it's been awhile, indra. oh. you're in a bad mood. didn't you come to see me. i'm aware of everything, you know. you did exactly as hagoromo wished. but he's still not satisfied. the future hagoromo envisions for ninshu is not the future you envision. you've improved. no matter what happens, the two of us will follow you, indra. i will remember your words. lord hagoromo. it's been one year since master ashura set out on his journey. but he still hasn't returned. your pupils are becoming restless. perhaps, you should decide on a successor. i realize that. no one will object to master indra. why do you insist on waiting for master ashura. don't worry. ashura will return soon. lord hagoromo. what's going on. master indra. master ashura has returned. hey. it's not just master ashura. there are so many with him. i recognize taizo, but who are the others. so he's back. you are astute about your own sons. i think this water jar has seen its day. my, my, it took a long time. the younger one is very clumsy. but his tenacity is quite something. i told you to mind your own business. i didn't do anything. i just watched, that's all. but i want to let you in on something. about the village indra went to. welcome back. it's great to be home. have you been well. yes. i'm glad you're well too, master ashura. please go and see lord hagoromo. what. didn't he decide on elder brother already. is father still. he's been waiting all this time for your return, master ashura. i see. father, i've returned. you've become very dignified, ashura. we got tired waiting for you. forgive me elder brother. with the level of my strength, i needed much longer to resolve the problem in the village. who are those people. oh, yes. these are some of the villagers. they all helped me. and are now valuable friends. we heard about this village, and we wanted to see it, so we accompanied master ashura. i see. welcome, good of you to come. ashura, let me hear your story. the village i went to relied on the divine tree's water source. so i decided to dig a well. ashura. are you seriously digging a well. it's what i've decided. what the hell. are they back to throw rocks at us. wait. you guys. we'll help you. we want to do it because it's for our village. if you can, could you teach us ninshu too. uhhuh. everyone, please be quiet. what's the matter, ashura. can you hear it. that sound. it's water.  what is it.  what happened. this is.  water.  we hit water.  we did it.  we did it. you did it, ashura. we did it. we did it. mom. kanna. mom. we are finally free from the curse. i see. so the ninshu that you spread has saved many people. yes. i will now name the successor to ninshu. the one who shall take over ninshu shall be. bonds allow people to share in each other's joy and sorrow. in the beginning, bonds overflow with love and emotion. as long as there are bonds, ninshu will not be used for evil. but power without bonds will surely bring calamity to this world. next time on naruto shippuden: the successor from here on out, i entrust my power to you. the successor tune in again. )
