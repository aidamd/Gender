huh.. the one known as the ultimate taijutsu user.. he's the hidden leaf hero who died during the third great ninja war. so i'm famous, eh. back then, i could only observe you from afar. as a taijutsu user, it is indeed a great honor to be able to battle with you. i'm being manipulated. i won't be able to show any mercy. i'd like nothing better. great leaf hurricane. great leaf hurricane. leaf gust. hhe's strong. guy is.losing ground. lee.. i'm sorry, i'll be right back. please stay here and rest, sai. you. must dodge this. not the legendary technique.. guy sensei. i will assist you. old master chen. i guess i'm really famous, eh. i'm so honored to see you again. he died before you were born. how did you meet him. the old master was not dead. what.. at that time. if you are the real master chen, i have a request. please teach me the leaf dragon god. you're that kid. i will never forget you. or the dragon's eye. the old master and the dragon's eye you're still a shinobi. one cannot give up on his dreams. what do you mean. what's going on. so you're his.. that's right, i never told you about this, guy sensei. as i recall. it was soon after i had recovered from my serious injuries. secret taijutsu techniques oh, look. i just came across it in the library.  ohh.  ohh. the leaf dragon god.. it seems to be a secret technique created by someone known as old master chen. the words "secret technique" make me excited. let's find master chen and ask him to teach it to us. but it says this man was a hidden leaf hero who died in the third great ninja war. huh. he's dead.. it's all right. i'm sure everything about the leaf dragon god is right here. no.. i wanted to master this, to become stronger while guy sensei was away. bushy brow. you can just train with me. i need to get stronger too, so i can bring sasuke back. naruto. seems this man's grave is near the village. really. then let's go pay our respects at the hero's grave, get inspired and train hard. do you bring rice balls here every day, azami. yeah, because it's grandpa's grave. so she's the old master's granddaughter. do you know how to do the leaf dragon god.. of course not. grandpa's alive. huh.. he comes to eat the rice balls. that's ridiculous. what does she mean by he's alive. this is so good. whwho are you.. he's old master chen.. that's impossible. he's fooling azami and tricking her into bringing rice balls. that's unforgivable. i'm not sharing with you guys. do not eat them. you ruined my one single enjoyment in life. leaf dragon god.  huh..  huh.. leaf dragon god. amazing. amazing. he was actually alive. and so. i believed it was a chance to learn the secret technique, and went to his grave again. if you are truly old master chen, i have a request. please teach me that technique. the leaf dragon god. i cannot use ninjutsu. that's why i want to hone my taijutsu skills. can't use ninjutsu, eh.. no, i can't. but i'm doing my best to prove that i can be a great shinobi with taijutsu alone. you're doing your best despite that, eh.. a shinobi who cannot use ninjutsu cannot be a shinobi. i will pound it into that body of yours that you are not qualified to be a shinobi.  bushy brow.  lee. what happened.just now. you are weak. just forget about being a shinobi. ththat's. how could you say such a cruel thing to my lee.. you, of all people, should know. it's ridiculous for him to risk his life on becoming a shinobi. how did you know that. he told me himself. you're going to see that old man. we'll keep you company. you guys. thank you, but please let me go alone.  huh.  huh. he said i'm not qualified. i want him to acknowledge my skills.  lee.  bushy brow and so.i'm going alone. i figured you would say that. huh. here. take this. azami asked me to give it to you. thank you. chen you're such a persistent kid. i won't ask you to teach me that technique. but please attack me with the leaf dragon god one more time. huh.. you said i'm not qualified to be a shinobi. i cannot accept that. if i'm able to defeat that technique. please say you'll acknowledge me as a shinobi. i beg you. please use your leaf dragon god once more. your tenacity has won me over. i will honor your request. although i doubt that you will be able to see through the dragon's eye. the dragon's.eye. now you will realize just how unqualified you are to be a shinobi. i will absolutely make you acknowledge me. leaf dragon god. dynamic entry. eat, then go home. and quit being a shinobi. please do it.one more time. the dragon's eye.and the tornado. i feel like i'm almost there. why won't you give up when you've been beaten up so badly. you're just like him. in any case, forget about being a shinobi. i.can never, ever give up my dream of being a shinobi. someone is staking his life on my becoming a shinobi. i have my promise with guy sensei. and you're repudiating it, so i cannot lose to you. so please, just one more time. forget your dream. i'm saying this for your own sake. please wait. and after that, i never saw him again. "forget your dream. " you said this for lee's sake. a shinobi who cannot use ninjutsu in the dangerous world of shinobi is powerless. perhaps one shouldn't even aim to become shinobi. old master, you were not mistaken in trying to get lee to give up being a shinobi. guy sensei. however. i will never accept that. what you did was wrong. guy sensei. i thought you, of all people, would understand me. however, i will prove to both of you, teacher and pupil. that you are wrong. we are not wrong. lee. you should be able to prove it to him. yes, sir. i never thought this moment would come. primary lotus. the leaf dragon god's true form is a tornado. so the dragon's eye is. i can't test it now even if i wanted to. leaf dragon god. what's the matter. have you given up. i believe i've told you before. i don't give up. is that what you call a dodge. the dragon's eye. is the eye of the tornado. that's its weakness. this is it for the leaf dragon god. oneman primary lotus. wwhat.. mymy leaf dragon god.. why. how can it be. why won't you give up after all this. i once sustained severe injuries and was on the brink of giving up my dreams. but guy sensei said this to me at that time. lee. if you want to be free from your suffering, make up your mind. do you mean to give up my dream. if you give up your dream, you will suffer even more. you're the kind of fool that can't go on living if you've lost your ninja way. you and i both. have the surgery, lee. your surgery will be a success because you have worked hard all the way through. you have the power to bring your own future in the heavens. and in the one in a million chance that something goes wrong. i will die with you. ever since i met you, my ninja way has been to nurture you into a fine ninja. guy sensei. i see. you found yourself a fine teacher.  old master.  old master. i, too, had a pupil long ago. and just like you, he was not able to use ninjutsu. but he said he would become a shinobi with only taijutsu and through hard training, his dream was realized. he was to be initiated in the ways of the leaf dragon god, but. the third great ninja war broke out. and my pupil also went into the battlefield. but for him, being unable to use ninjutsu and genjutsu was his weakness. and much to my regret, he was killed. i allowed my pupil to become a shinobi without even thinking of the consequences. i am not qualified to be a master. i was unable to forgive myself, so i abandoned my shinobi life, faked my death and put up a gravestone. i see. so that's how it was. forgive me. i thought you would walk the same path as my pupil, that's why. however, you two will do just fine. old master chen. the time has come for that grave to actually be of use. old master chen. i'll bring you offerings of rice balls. he's a reanimation too. he's crying. he looks like a child. shikamaru. choji. ino. it's me. why does he know our names.. i don't know this guy. me neither. next time on naruto shippuden: "rain followed by snow, with some lightning" no, we know you. tune in again. )
