i can't take it anymore. get me off this ship. gget me off. get me off, please. get a hold of yourself, bushy brow sensei. guy sensei may be prone to seasickness, but these waves are indeed hard to take. yes, i think im going to. what are we going to do. get me off. get me off, please. i really. come on, its just a little seasickness. what a bunch of wimps. still, all this reeling is hard to take. we should dock somewhere and wait for guy and the weather to get better. you're right. we'll go slightly off course, but there's an island to the east. i remember it. an uninhabited island in a neutral zone. let's see. here it is. that's it. let's stop there. okay. whoa. bbetter hurry. hes not going to make it. changing course. set sail towards northnortheast. im gonna throw up. the ninja of benisu get a hold of yourself. it's naruto. hey, over here. what are you doing in a place like this. sakura.. those waves were pretty bad. it was awful. everyone was getting sick. so you're here to give guy sensei a rest. anyway, what's your mission here. right. on lady tsunade's orders. we're going to the eastern sea too. the fourth great ninja war will soon begin. before that. i want to gather secret herbs as well as ingredients to make food pills. okay, here. nanakusa island. it is a treasure trove of medicinal herbs. i've marked the sites where they can be found on the map. mandra plant, energy ginseng, red newt, huge mato plant. there certainly are a lot. where is this. go there if you have time. don't go out of your way. right. so you're the captain. guy sensei fell asleep. preparations are ready. you can leave anytime. so, you're the remnants of team 10 minus shikamaru. we're not remnants. at least call us the leftovers. you should talk, naruto. team 7 got scattered because of you. sai's on a different mission too. i see. i guess so. everyone's doing something. shouldn't i be doing something too. you have a big mission ahead of you. this journey is specifically for that purpose. i know, but. i have an idea, naruto. you can't set sail until guy sensei feels better, right. come and help us. huh. gathering herbs. yes. just gathering herbs. easy, right. wrong. how many guesses is that.. huh. then, this. what are you looking at.. that's totally different. i can't tell at all. this isn't easy at all, damn it. i should've just stayed back with those two and kept an eye on guy sensei. when guy sensei feels better, we'll need to discuss our sailing schedule with him. oh well, if i stayed back, i'd just be killing time. here, use this as a sample. once the war begins, people will be injured. maybe a hundred, maybe a thousand. this work is absolutely necessary in order to treat the wounded. right. lady tsunade said this is a treasure trove of medicinal herbs, but finding them is harder than expected. do you want to change locations. let's go higher up. we need to find ingredients for the food pills too. i guess so. we can never have enough. oh, wait a minute. its so bitter. okay, now i know what it tastes like. all right. here i go. naruto. this one. nope. this one. nope. this one. nope. huh. is this it. it sorta tastes different, and yet, it sorta tastes like it. strange. you'd think mandra plant would be growing everywhere around here. maybe the weather was bad. energy ginseng. oh, there it is. it's growing in a nice, orderly way. these will make great food pills. just a minute. who are you.. im sorry, but we found that patch of ginseng first. from your headbands, i presume you are from the hidden leaf. and you are. i guess people from the great nations wouldnt know anything about us little country folk. we are shinobi from benisu island in the south. im bando, a jonin. i'm sada, a genin. i'm kiji. we heard that war was imminent and came here to gather medicinal herbs. no wonder. thats why we couldn't find anything no matter how much we looked. you guys picked everything. yes, we've covered just about every site. however, i know that leaves you in a bind. this is. thank you. it will benefit the allied shinobi forces too. i'm glad you are pleased. well. okay then. let's see.click, click, and click. how about this much per bunch. huh. well. you hidden leaf people drive a hard bargain. now this is as low as i can go. how about this. you expect to get paid for this. you're not giving it to us. huh. give me a break. if we did that, a small nation like ours couldn't survive. fine, if the hidden leaf isn't interested in purchasing from us, we can sell it to other feudal lords in other lands. shinobi arent the only ones who get wounded in war. knowing that, you still intend to make money.. you receive money for the missions you undertake too. you separate them into different ranks and put a price on them. forgive me. but please understand. we need funds for our own selfdefense. here we go. here we go.  pluck one for money, here we go.  pluck one for money, here we go.  pluck two for money, all right.  pluck two for money, all right.  pluck three for money,  pluck three for money,  pluck four for money, all right.  pluck four for money, all right. what should we do. there's no way we can complete our mission like this. and yet, we can't just seize their stash. of course not. now that we have a shinobi alliance, we can't start trouble with other shinobi. i don't know why you're so concerned, sakura. this island is a treasure trove of medicinal herbs, right. what's the big deal if someone took the herbs from this area. exactly. rare herbs are still waiting to be picked. but don't think that they will be easy to obtain. most of the sites are quite dangerous. just leave it to me. what's wrong. please excuse us. do be careful. oh, hey. he went ahead. what happened, naruto.. my belly.hurts. how can i get a bellyache from eating medicinal herbs. medicinal herbs. maybe you ate some poisonous herbs instead of medicinal herbs. hhuh. naruto. hurry. i know, but. there should be some huge mato plant growing around here. i wonder if they've already picked them. i hope thats not true. what.. let's hurry. at this rate, it's firstcome, firstserve. giant mato plant. oh, there's still a few. maybe they left them for us. let's pick 'em. don't, naruto. they left them so they can reseed. leaving behind the roots is the basic rule when harvesting. what. but isnt this for our sake. let's go to the next site. were going upstream to look for red newt. hurry.  okay.  okay. so long. those guys.  hold it.  wait. there's a note. "do not cross this bridge. " "only for the exclusive use of the benisu.  we're gonna cross anyway. hey naruto. maybe it's another trap. like i care. besides, my stomach feels better. mmy entire body feels numb and i can't move. hey, look. look what's wrapped around here. isnt that a paralyzing herb. it was a trap, after all. i knew it. no, hey. i mean. ccan you help me. naruto.. what about your side. i don't see any. hey, i found a red newt. found it. a red newt. its just one though. judging from its size, it's not fully grown yet. i have no choice but to release it. they beat us to it again. we used up a lot of time. thats right. why are we taking it easy like this. it's cold. let's get going to the next spot. whose fault is it that we're wasting time.. so. what'll we do. this place is no good. i guess we'll just have to go here. hell valley. hell valley. for the mud that gushes out from underground. it's an elixir mud for bruises, cuts and sprains. however, lady tsunade said not to go out of our way to get it. go there if you have time. don't go out of your way. it's probably.very dangerous. it's settled then. let's go to hell valley. now then. what's going on. you guys. you guys better not be laying another trap. oh, not at all. we would never do that to the hidden leaf. we were just getting ready to harvest some plants. we want nothing to do with you anymore. we're getting the elixir mud, then were leaving. please wait. what is it. stalling us again. this service is free of charge. take a look. gas is being released intermittently. it's toxic. if you're exposed to it for a long period of time. furthermore, there's no pattern to when its released. so the problem is how to get in to gather the mud. multishadow clone jutsu. go. i can't breathe. hot. oh. all right. the elixir mud. i'm taking it. hot. you gotta have some utensils to collect this mud. this one's a big gamble. it's sink or swim. or rather, simply impossible. thanks to you, i was able to confirm a route. you intend to go.. i'm not in this business for fun. to survive in a small nation, we have to take desperate measures. we'll go when the gas stops again.  right.  right. hey. they're amazing. it's dangerous. wind style: great breach. wind style jutsu.. way to go.  got it.  got it. good job. let's get out of here. what is that.. wind style: great breach. hurry. run. run.  right.  right. this is bad. hey, it's impossible if that things running. whoa. wwind style.great. keep it going. why.. your assistance is unnecessary. if we are indebted to a great nation, who knows what kind of bill we'll get later. we don't want money for this. i don't trust you. you people have always. well, this service is free of charge. giant rasengan. i don't know what to say. i. i want to thank you for coming to our rescue. and.are you sure we don't owe you any money. i told you. it's on the house. just because we're shinobi from another land doesn't make us enemies. but. sometimes, we have to put aside our differences and join together. the allied shinobi forces is just that. but then. sada, kiji. there's no charge. let's just be grateful for their kindness. yyes. here, it's on the house, from us. please take the elixir mud. huh. no kidding. gee thanks. yes. and if you like. please take the medicinal herbs that we packed up. it's our way of assisting the allied shinobi forces. yes. mission complete. that's a huge help. thank you very much. you're awesome. oh no, no. i would say the same about you. this has been a great learning experience. hey, thank you. good luck to you guys. are you sure about this, bando. you're letting them have it for free. well, it's only until i call in this debt from the allied shinobi forces. i'm taking a loss now for a gain later.  oh  oh farewell. it's only for a short while. thanks to this trip, i've gotten used to sailing. i really hope so. naruto. be careful. and good luck on your special mission. right. it is said that it appears on foggy night such as this. guiding the souls of the dead, led in by crows. a large devil fire lighting the top of its mast. if you come across it, youre doomed to a journey by sea to the land of the dead. next time: the cursed ghost ship its here. tune in again. )
