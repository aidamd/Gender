the rudder isn't working. this is some storm. what's going to happen if we keep getting swept away by the current.. it seems like it will be okay. if we continue like this, we'll get back on course. we're gonna head straight to the land of lightning. what was that.. what's happening. here comes another one. shells made from paper bombs. that thing's firepower is considerable. where is it coming from. is that. a battleship. no. it's an island. battleship island we're being sucked in towards that island. can you change course.. i can't. the rudder still isn't working. you gotta be kidding me. naruto. wood style. the ship. the cargo, scrap metal, everything. scoop it all up. even the humans. boss gataro. iit's impossible. the ship should've been blown apart. no one returns to the island unless their net is full. as usual, a painful experience lies in wait for any boat without a full load. hey you. how dare you mess with our ship. see, there's treasure, after all. wha.. a feisty one like you is sure to bring a good price at auction. but this is a piece of junk. hey, that's my headband. open fire. corner the brat. prepare to fire. coordinates: portside 12 degrees, angle 26 degrees, distance 500. fire. run, keep running. oh no. wwhat is this.. what.. you idiots. that ship hasn't been destroyed yet. fire. fire. fire away. don't let them get away. switch to depth charges. never mind, just kill them. blast them to smithereens. say. how can the ship dive underwater. it's hastily made, but i used my wood style to cover the ship's body and improvised a ballast tank to take in water to keep us below the surface. it's a makeshift submarine. thank goodness we brought a sensorytype along. we've managed to get out of range of the depth charges. can't we stay underwater and make it out of this region. well. originally, this was a sailing ship. it has no power to propel forward underwater. right now, the current is merely pulling us along. the water depth decreases beyond this point. when the mole comes up, i'll blow it to pieces. we have no choice but to maintain this depth. so we can't surface again. it's flooding. plug it up. stop. towards twelve o'clock. there's a current of air directly below on the ocean bottom. we can go through. everyone, run up to the front. that was a close one. where are we. it looks like. an underwater cavern. there are more tunnels further in. as for our location, we must be beneath the island. stairs. this cavern seems to have been excavated for human use. then, there could be a way to get to the surface. let's split up and check. naruto. where are you going.. i'm going back to get my headband. hold it. didn't i tell you. going back to the surface right now means certain death. that headband is important to me. you will get it back. you definitely will. but for now, we'll stay hidden and wait for our chance. besides, i think. i used my wood style too much. i'll be fine once i rest a bit. captain yamato. hhot.. it's a hot spring, captain yamato. we can easily replenish our chakra by resting here. you're right. this water feels great. what is this. it seems these people were the islanders. islanders. you mean they were with those pirates. no. it seems they were the indigenous people of this island. what's going on. several decades ago those pirates attacked the island and it's written here that the native islanders were slaughtered. what. these people got away by going underground through a tunnel in the mountain and hiding themselves. run, run. i want to be entertained until their boat surfaces. just grin and bear it. the next boat with the lowest yield, come on out. the pirates occupy the land above. if these people were discovered, it meant certain death. that's why. they lived down here quietly for decades. how sad. what're you doing. i, naruto uzumaki, will get justice for their pain and suffering. looks like i have no choice but to see that guy again. so they used this tunnel. it's no good. the line is frayed and doesn't work. it's a volcanic crater. it's quite a ways to the top. hey, how come it's so warm. it seems there's a subterranean hot spring stream. yeah, there is. captain yamato was taking a soak until a while ago. it's quite large. wwhat's the matter, naruto. hot springs.floating. wood. wood style. submarine.. i got it. what is it, naruto. just hear me out. don't laugh, okay. how about this strategy. no good. no, let's try it. hey naruto. i'm okay. all right. let's sail. bushy brow sensei. you're on. right. you got it. how was that. i guess it was imposs. hot.  all right. float upwards.  way to go. just you wait, you pirates. boss gataro. maybe those guys died at the bottom of the sea. no sense in waiting any longer. are you telling me what to do.. that kid's not gonna die that easily. i decided to kill him and i'm gonna do a thorough job of it. just like the time i took over this island. wwhat just happened.. damn that brat. one more. stop firing or it'll explode. damn that. how's that.. gget him. if you let him escape, you're all dead. surround him. catch him like a rat in a mousetrap. i'm not gonna lose. this is retribution for all the islanders' suffering. are you kidding. this island is mine. if you make trouble, i'll kill you all the same way i killed the others. wait a minute. where are your friends. you're the one who's gonna get pulverized. why you clones, eh. over here. over here. what's that.. hey, you pirates. get ready for this. wood style. go. fly. all right. i have avenged you. hey aoba, is this really the island. well, judging from the direction it flew off to, we can safely say this is its habitat. to think that there was a bird that could fly off with guy sensei. we have to look for him quickly. wait. there's someone there. i'll go talk to them. you guys continue the search. next time on naruto shippuden: the forgotten island wait. just who are you. tune in again. )
