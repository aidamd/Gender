mina.. i'll go ask him about what happened earlier. his genetic data slumbers here. the sacrifice is still alive too. i don't think it's a cold. is he all right. could it have been the breakfast. oh no, no. he's been feeling like this since yesterday. brother naruto. time to train. our ninjutsu. everyone, naruto's not feeling well. huh. you were gonna teach us selfdefense. and you're supposed to be a hidden leaf hero. all right, guys. in order to overcome all sorts of hardship and challenges, you need to build up your strength and physical fitness. but training without a set plan isn't gonna work. and so. i put together.  he's so eager.  all my years of harsh training and. i named it, "naruto's powerful miracle training". looks interesting.  why don't you try it too, brother.  if you do this training, you'll be effective when the time comes. it looks hard. i don't want to do anything tiring. don't be such a wimp. put your all into everything you do.  got it.  got it. all right. first, we'll run to the lake. man, this is lame. no kidding.hmm. what's this diversion anyway. you don't even know what it means. what are you, stupid. no. i'm just saying being used by kabuto is the worst. being immortal was your best trait. yet look at you, you're all in pieces. so pitiful. huh. what about you. what happened to blowing yourself up. no, with my ultimate art. i scattered in an extraordinarily sublime manner, hmm. what's to brag about. you died. you're in the same situation. this is the end of training. i worked up a nice sweat. that was easy. you all did great. i'll go buy some drinks. wait, okay. naruto. that's so uncool. i'm not feeling a hundred percent today.  are you really a hero.  cut it out. sounds like a lie. you're always harping about art this, art that. but the explosives you design are so trashy. idiot. well, your ceremonies are always so damn long. think about how i feel, having to follow you. i don't need you to do anything after me, you fake. you can't even do anything if you step out of the curse symbol. so there. hmm. huh. then maybe i should curse you. not before i blow you up with my art. we're done warming up. yeah.  can i get ice cream from that shop.  of course.  do it.  do it.  watch me, dad.  oh.  is it good.  yeah. i'm glad you like it.  over here.  wait up. papa. mama. papa. mom. mama. dad. i wish i could see them. i wish i could see them. i miss them. i miss them. why are you lonely. there's someone who's always with you. hey, you're making no effort to lose that weight, are you. that's not true. when i'm all healed, i'll start exercising. oh yeah. then i'll oversee your training. hi.there. what's the matter, everyone. naruto. you pushed yourself too hard. i'll be fine once i get some sleep. take. take it. take it. take it. take it. take it. get out. get out. get out. get out. get out. get out. hey. get out. get out. get out. get out. get out. get out.  that's enough, mina.  get out. what's the matter.  get out. get out. get out.  don't say such rude things to naruto.  get out. get out. get out.  mina. mina. get out. get out. get out. get out. get out. mina. she doesn't like you. did i do something. i don't understand. do you really feel all right. i'm fine. let me examine you. huh. hey, not like that. stop it, sakura. stop wiggling around. why am i worrying about you anyway.. isn't that the chief of the village. i wanted to let you know, so i rushed over. this man came to the town hall this morning. chief. grandpa. grandpa. grandpa. i'm so glad you're both all right. and you too, chief. i injured my eyes. i was wandering across the wilderness when someone saved me. dokku, i put such a burden on your shoulders. oh, no such thing. by the way, i have something important to ask you. yes. do you remember that item i gave you that night. you may already have guessed. but, that was a portion of the treasure which was hidden in the village altar. to protect it from robbers, i entrusted parts of it to another guard, just as i did to you. regrettably, five of the parts including mine. are now in their hands. the remaining two must be protected at all cost. that is why i intend to ask disonasu here to take custody of them, and keep them safe. yes. you're sure about this. yes. that's my decision. i understand. and.where are the rest. yes, that's. don't. grandpa is strange. huh.  huh. he's.  a reanimation.. that girl is sharp. is she special. kabuto. we've been tricked. i'm taking fatso over there and getting information out of him. and then. chief. grandpa. a sacrifice that's almost dead is useless, huh. i'm very sorry. what's wrong, naruto.. take it. take it. get out, get out, get out. get out, get out, get out. get out, get out, get out.  mina, stop that.  get out. get out. get out. get out, get out. get out, get out, get out.  mina, mina..  get out. get out. get out. get out. get out. get out.  mina.  get out. get out of brother naruto. the nine tails' power, eh. why you.. power people like you with immense power. even if you choose to use that power for good or evil, you still have to shoulder the weight of having such a huge responsibility. what made you want to become stronger. next time on naruto shippuden: "power  episode 4" that strong conviction inside will surely guide you. tune in again. )
