man, what a relief. you sure took a long one. naruto's way ahead of us now. i couldn't hold it in any longer and you're about to lose your composure but now, i'm feeling good and dandy so don't worry, be happy instead of wasting time on your silly rap, let's hurry after naruto. bee. i finally caught up with you. what's up, brother motoi. lord raikage ordered me to come. i'm supposed to assist you. thank you, brother motoi. how come your hand is wet. don't sweat the small stuff. and where's naruto. i was a pissin' and he went a missin' that yellow leader's beyond reach what's irritating is the school teach i see, so he went ahead. pissing.. hey wait, bee. that's the eight tails. he's this far already. we should try to delay him. bee and naruto are approaching. i was told to leave naruto alone. but not the eight tails. i want to conduct lord orochimaru's tests on him. bee, i'll prepare the perfect reanimation for you. this will be fun. bee, your hand was wet because. don't make a big deal out of nothing, brother. it probably wasn't just "nothing. " damn. the enemy. wwhat was that all about.. no way, is that... that's. you're the former jinchuriki. fukai. it's been a while, bee. and you're.motoi. why are you here.. someone performed the reanimation on me. fukai. that day 30 years ago. yes, the day you died. we tried to stop the eight tails' rampage and eight shinobi lost their lives. my dad was among them. i see. i'm so sorry. but i know that apologies won't bring him back. yes, he's fukai. but why. no matter how hard i try, i don't remember a lot about that rampage. bee, this chakra i sense from you. i see, so you became a jinchuriki. probably, after me. this boy will become the eight tails' jinchuriki. isn't that what you've heard from the elders. no. no one's told me anything yet. my old man, my uncle. they all failed. i'm not compatible either. listen, as your cousin. but look, you have the eight tails under control right now. just listen. only those who are jinchuriki can understand. friends and acquaintances start to look at you differently afterwards. they probably think they're treating you the same, but you begin to see that they're not. you don't get rewarded for this. "am i compatible." walking through life with the shadow of your own death beside you it fills your mind day in and day out. and you begin to lose sight of who you are. you feel a hole in your heart. and the tailed beast waits to pounce on that weak heart and run wild. when you live with the constant fear of death, you start wanting to die. but.you have a knack for ninjutsu. you have the skill and the ancestry. you have everything going for you. yeah. that's exactly the reasoning they used when they chose me as the eight tails' jinchuriki. but that's not what's essential to become a jinchuriki. so what is it. having something that can fill the hole in your heart. what is this "something". it's just "something". if i can find it, i feel i can stay strong. let bee find that something. bee. i can't control myself. so run. if the eight tails isn't inside you no more you can't fight like you did before you're wrong. all right, fukai. why don't you show them you're serious. bee. motoi. get away. what.. the tailed beast cloak. this chakra. it's unmistakably mine. when did he.. what's going on.. how's it possible.. the eight tails' chakra through a reanimation.. this is one of my secret weapons. lord orochimaru's laboratory was full of interesting things. of all the places.. i have something very precious hidden away here. this is. the eight tails' horn. the eight tails. i obtained the cells of the eight tails, and it took me years to cultivate this much. when did you produce this. long before you were born. what i had to go through to get this. but with this, all sorts of experiments are possible. that kabuto. if he can revive something like this through reanimation. why would he bother engaging the eight tails. he could have sealed this chakra in the gedo statue. dodge this, bee. damn it. get away, bee. he's ensnaring us in his attack too. that was a good one, samehada that's some appetite he devoured the chakra of the tailed beast bomb.. well, it's my turn to make an entrance. bee, are you going to go into eight tails state.  lariat.  lariat. all this force just from colliding into each other.. a hole in the heart: the other jinchuriki why do you have my chakra.. when you died, i extracted myself from you. it's been a long time, eight tails. to think we'd see each other under these circumstances. i'm disappointed too. i had high hopes for you. we were completely fooled. by whom. thirty years ago. oh, it's you, ay. watch how you approach me. what's wrong. can't sleep. especially during a full moon. it's like the big hole in my heart. you still haven't found something to fill it. i probably won't. even if i'm physically here. my heart is dead. i wander the desert alone. if i can't get out of here, i'll never find it. is there anything i can do. my heart is too sick. when the time comes. i'm counting on you. here you go. they're not the usual ones. they're new. those will help you sleep better. i see. thanks. i will fill your heart. it's useless. that medication you took was my special genjutsu pill. why.you.. living is difficult for you, isn't it. i shall liberate you from the pain and suffering of being a jinchuriki, and guide you back from the land of the dead. all right, eight tails. come on out. don't mess with me, you lowly humans. orochimaru. so that's what happened. no wonder i don't remember it. i was also trapped in orochimaru's genjutsu. so my true enemy is orochimaru. bee. run. his power right now isn't a problem. we can handle it, bee. reanimation. different form easy annihilation yay. tailed beast bomb. did it work.. he revived. it's useless. run. the only way to stop a reanimated body is to seal it. bee, let's prepare for the sealing. retreat for now. oh, well then. i won't let you get away, eight tails. what is this. chakra from two octopops.. don't tell me there's another eight tails.. don't go back, naruto. old man raikage. let bee handle this. but.. bee will not lose. besides, even if you go, you can't bring down what fukai has become. huh.. only bee can fill the hole in fukai's heart. the hole in his heart. okay, old man raikage. i'll believe in octopops. this is not good at all. we're in a quandary yeah, what a calamity but escape is my specialty how can you rap at a time like this. wouldn't you rather jump into a hole if there was one. hole. a hole in the heart. damn. look at them fight. my dad courageously fought guys like them. what am i waiting for.. i'll draw him in. make a run for it then. brother motoi. lightning style. spider web. stop. brother motoi. i told you to get away. i won't lose you're my teacher but this time, i'll give the lecture i owe it to you. bee, do you know why ay is strong. ay was raised carefully, without being pampered because he was in line to become the raikage. all that was bestowed on him from the villagers, including lord raikage, he has graciously accepted, and fulfilled their hopes and expectations. a boy who was once prone to tears and so sensitive, grew up to be mighty and strong. as someone special to lord raikage. a special person. that's how i found it. what is it, bro. hmm. mmm. you will now become a jinchuriki. things won't be the same anymore. it will be extremely tough. no kidding. it's always been like that i'll just give the octopus a nickname as i rap listen up, bee. always tell me everything, got it. you are special to me. we are the ultimate tag team. i have special people around who always support me. i see. you found them. lots of special friends. that "something" to fill the hole in your heart. and you're one of those who are special to me that hole in your heart, i'll fill it completely if only i had been able to find it back then. bee, stop this war. are you okay, brother. yeah. did i fight bravely like my dad. oh yeah. you had courage out there. i'll take you to the medical corps right away. i'm all right. just. bee, carry out fukai's wishes. you got it, brother. fukai. your sadness ran so deep but that's over, 'cuz this i vow my real war is just starting now there's a special way to fight between puppet users. and i'm the only one here who can do this. right, granny chiyo. after meeting naruto, i was able to do the right thing in the end. i thought i died, leaving some hope for a bright future. but it seems. next time on naruto shippuden: "the soul living inside the puppet" sasori, i was. the soul living inside the puppet tune in again. )
