killer bee rappuden: part 2 acrobat. so the jinchuriki can fight, a little. i can fight well, i'm infallible. but to you, i can't be affable. if you know where sasuke is. .tell me. what. sasori. deidara. i'm done here. what do you mean, "i'm done". i'm leaving the akatsuki. what are you saying. i'm leaving with nagato. don't run away. hey, so what are we going to do, sasori, my man. do you need to even ask. we're going to take them down ourselves. it's three against two. doesn't matter. guess you're right, hmm. i'll show them my art. what is this. hey, you. why are you causing an uproar in the hidden waterfall village. who is that. that's the seven tails' jinchuriki. she is. hey, chomei. fuu, they're comrades. comrades. of mine. hey, jinchuriki. they're the enemy. i don't understand what you're saying. now it's four against two. okay, let's retreat. what. okay. i'll get you next time. what. they took off. you're fuu of the hidden waterfall, right. gimme a fist bump. hey, what's the matter. you're kinda shady, mister. what're you saying, baby. c'mon, gimme a fist bump. hey, what's the matter.. you're kinda shady, mister. what're you saying, baby. c'mon. gimme a fist bump. no.  a fist bump.  no.  give it here.  no.  give it here.  no. at any rate. just give him a fist bump. gimme a fist bump. no. wait. you have a mission to carry out. i don't take orders from shinobi from another village. we're comrades. you could even say we are friends. friends. we're friends. yes. you are not alone. fuu seems to have softened up to gaara. this started out with a lot of trouble. but i'll say, the result is acceptable. octopops, i think your facial hair and shades are to blame. shut up. let's move on to the next one. ten tails. what's that. a gigantic weapon that the akatsuki summoned. it absorbed the tailed beasts' chakra which is why we can't utilize our full power. right now, ten tails can't summon its full power either. the princess of rappu castle sealed it. but the ten tails has ultimate power on the night of the full moon. they'll target the princess and go to the castle. unless every jinchuriki comes together, we won't have a chance against it. the nine of us will protect the princess and the castle.yay. gimme a fist bump. wwhat's the big idea. hey, son goku. tell him that we're not enemies. you heard him. i'm sorry about that. suspicious characters have been showing up lately. so i assumed you were one of them. i'm telling you. it's that facial hair and shades. no need to critique my physique. what do you mean by "suspicious characters". i don't know who they are. but they've been kidnapping children from our village. it definitely appears like it's tracking prey. chomei. let's chase 'em away. agreed. scale powder. it was a summoning. if you interfere, i'll show you no mercy. sasuke. naruto. you were able to leave the village. what about you. you're coming back to the village. i don't take orders from you. are you the kidnapper.. what of it. sasuke. you've stooped so low to be orochimaru's underling, that you've started doing things like this. and you don't even know how itachi's feels. don't you dare mention itachi's name. itachi deserted the akatsuki and is looking for you. what. my, my. a gathering of jinchuriki. i wonder what you're all planning to do. orochimaru. although you're probably helpless because your tailed beast powers have been stolen. sasuke. shall we destroy them. orochimaru. i'm done here. what. what do you mean "i'm done". i'm going after itachi. hey, hold it. naruto. don't forget the mission at hand. you're the one behind the kidnappings. i'll punish you now. powerless jinchuriki. i wouldn't talk if i were you. summoning jutsu. so, what are you going to do. son goku. lord orochimaru. i'm okay. i'm out of chakra. shukaku. lord orochimaru. i'm okay. my turn. lord orochimaru. i'm okay. tailed beast lariat. llord orochimaru. oh my.this is too much even for me. take this.  well..  we did it. no, that's just shed skin. even if they're weakened, they still pack a punch when they join forces. he's as tough as ever. but he looks worn out. lord orochimaru. i'll get you next time. one down. come with us so that we can put a stop to the akatsuki's plot. all right. we'll join up with yugito and the others. i still can't locate yagura, the three tails' jinchuriki. he wasn't in the land of water. any clues. yagura is supposedly heading to some wetlands somewhere. but i can't verify it. even if you can't, we need all of the jinchuriki, right. yeah, unless every jinchuriki comes together, we can't beat the ten tails. those guys will begin their attack on the next full moon. targeting the time when the seal will weaken. how much time do we have left. about seven days. let's split up and search for yagura. otherwise, we'll have to fight the akatsuki with one member short. we'll split up into twoman teams and search in all four directions. all right, everyone. no matter what the result, do not fail to gather at rappu castle in seven days. let's go, yugito. look forward to working with you. okay. can you see anything. no. there's mist everywhere. then i'll check around in sage mode. what's wrong. pursuers from the leaf. they're looking for me. get on. it seems no one wants to give jinchuriki their freedom. they treat us like dangerous vessels that contain tailed beasts. we're not dangerous, and neither are tailed beasts. it's yagura, the three tails' jinchuriki. gimme a fist bump. isobu, tell him. without a doubt, these two look suspicious, but they are jinchuriki friends. jinchuriki don't have friends. just being jinchuriki fills people with fear, resentment and hatred. sometimes, we're hunted by people of our own village. that's our fate as jinchuriki. so i want no part of this. i'll stay here by myself. we need your power. go away. come with us. that is your destiny. don't force anymore destiny on me. do you want me to force him. stay out of this. we are all jinchuriki. the fate forced on me as a jinchuriki is more than enough for me. whether it was forced on you or not, this is your fate. shut up. fool, ya fool. as long as it's your destiny, you've got to see it through. you. we're the same jinchuriki as you. we don't fear you. we don't resent you. and we don't hate you. gimme a fist bump. let's combine your power with ours. it will soon be the night of the full moon. how come octopops isn't here. he's the one who planned all of this. not just one person is missing, but three. will we be able to pull this off. probably not. what should we do, aunty yugito. "aunty". oh, i mean. sister yugito. we have no choice but to have faith that bee and the others will come. they've appeared. go. let's go too, hmm. no need to rush. wait for the moon to rise. the akatsuki genin are attacking. defend the castle. don't let a single one get inside. water style: bubble jutsu. lava style: scorching rocks jutsu. wind style: rasen shuriken. looks like we have to get involved, hmm. that's not necessary. the gedo statue.. they're gonna use that to attack. it won't be at full strength, but it should suffice. but there isn't a single fragment of art to it though. it's a tailed beast bomb. damn. the way i am right now, i can't take it down. is everyone okay. now. charge. ththis isn't good. steam dash. that's. friends. now that i'm here, you don't have to worry. sorry to keep you waiting. you're late, octopops. but you found yagura of the three tails. yeah. all nine of us are together. okay, jinchuriki. raise your fists. what is that.. one tail. two tails. three tails. four tails. five tails. six tails. seven tails. and nine tails, y'know. we are the jinchuriki who stand before you. that's kind of artsy. it doesn't matter at this point if they're assembled together. there are tailed beast bombs over there too. what of it. shukaku. matatabi. isobu. son goku. kokuo. saiken. kurama. this isn't good. don't think you've won. next time, i swear you're going down. hmm. phew. i'm pooped. i'm out of chakra again. we won. we did it. yeah, we did. but unless we get back our tailed beast power, we can't call this a true victory. that said. today's a huge win. karin. wake up. karin. get a hold of yourself. i'll go get the medical unit now. sasuke, sasuke, it's okay. it's too so.so.i have a request. next time on naruto shippuden: "to see that smile, just one more time. " like that one time, back then. to see that smile, just one more time tune in again. )
