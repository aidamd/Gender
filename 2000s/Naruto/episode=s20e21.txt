he's regained consciousness. thank goodness. what. where am i. is everyone okay. we're on our way back to the village. for some reason, the enemy retreated. even though we were at a disadvantage. their goal was to deliver sasuke to orochimaru. yeah, but that's just a hunch. huh. where's sasuke. what happened to sasuke.. when i caught up, i only found you unconscious. sorry. i couldn't track them due to the rain. i see. but. i promised sakura. take it easy. no, i can't just lie around. jiraiya ninja scrolls: the tale of naruto the heroanother moon i've sent kotetsu and izumo home. but just to be safe, kakashi will remain overnight. i see.that's a relief. urgent news. someone has infiltrated the village. you're. it's been a while, lady tsunade. do you know him. you're the boy jiraiya saved and took care of. from the hidden rain village. you're yahiko, right. so you remember me. i am called pain now. yahiko.. the one from the hizashi incident three years ago.. why did you sneak in. our pain is twofold. firstly, from the five great nations and the five great villages. the pain of being trampled by all of you. the physical pain of the people you killed. secondly, from the pain in our hearts caused by the hidden leaf's betrayal. and now, our pain will become the entire world's pain. what. true planetary devastation. what is that.. shikamaru, explain it to me. as you can see. it's something that defies the boundaries of reality. hey neji. is everyone in the village safe. can you confirm what's inside that big thing with your byakugan. yeah, i'm already on it. i'm starting to see chakra and it seems to be coming from the villagers. so they're okay.. yeah. but i'm not positive. why that. what do you think you're doing, in your condition.. i don't know what kind of jutsu that is, but i'll undo it. sakura, you're okay. i was out on a mission. what happened here. we don't know. anyway, we have to find the guy who did this and rescue everyone. that's crazy. you shouldn't move in your condition. but everyone's inside that thing. we can't just sit back and twiddle our thumbs. sit over there. just sit down. you need to recover first. all right, i'll use this time to what.. what's happening.. it seems the power supply was cut off and the emergency backup system was activated. i can't teleport outside of the village. the wall.is closing in.. at this rate. a simple earth style will do. use a rock pillar as a support. to stop it from closing in. the akimichi clan will use, their super expansion jutsu to push the wall back. i'll do whatever it takes to hold it back. the priority of the leaf police is to ensure the safety of all residents. now go. we will protect the hidden leaf village. stop the wall, no matter what it takes. a physical attack has absolutely no effect. everyone reacted swiftly. minato. this is a special sealing jutsu. if this continues, everyone will be crushed by the mass of stone. everyone is pushing it back, but it's only a matter of time. we have to do something about the jutsu caster. lord fourth. i have an idea. kushina, please stay here with these two. flying raijin jutsu. lord third. is that you, minato. this is a sealing attack by the enemy. unless this jutsu is countered with a jutsu of equal strength, everyone will be crushed. as i thought. i was thinking about using the four crimson ray formation. if you would help me, lord hiruzen. all right. lord fourth, tsunade possesses powers equal to that of a hokage. that makes three. the four crimson ray formation. kushina has the nine tails' chakra. and she has more experience with sealing jutsu than anyone here, rivaling that of a hokage. but the four crimson ray formation is no match for this powerful sealing jutsu. even a tailed beast would have a difficult time suppressing it. but we don't have time. if we combine our strength with everyone who is pushing back the wall, at least we can buy some time. buy time, then what. unless we do something about the jutsu itself, this doesn't solve anything. we'll think of something definitive during that time. please get to each of the four points of the village. all right. shizune, go tend to the wounded. understood.  four crimson ray formation.  four crimson ray formation. all right, everyone, hang in there. if we can buy time, there's hope. thanks to you sakura, i'm fully recovered. why that. hey wait, naruto. you've just recovered. he's hopeless. summoning jutsu. are you the ones who wrecked the village.. first off, i'm gonna beat up each one of you, then we'll talk. that guy.. naruto. that guy's yahiko. from team jiraiya. you destroyed that village, and you still call yourselves pupils of pervy sage. we're the akatsuki. i'm tendo pain. we cast off the name jiraiya the moment the hokage of the hidden leaf burned that village and everything inside of it to the ground. in order to hide the injustice that occurred there. what are you talking about. you're the ones who destroyed that village. we have proof. all that's left is to render judgment. for the pain caused to the weak. the pain of death, of my friends. my precious friends. the people of the hidden leaf village and the hokage will get to taste pain. i'll settle this. naruto. summoning jutsu. naruto. why not. he's not an opponent that we can deal with. however, naruto. amazing. summoning jutsu. shadow clone jutsu.  sage art: giant rasengan.  sage art: giant rasengan. no doubt. the dimensions are different. but i can't just stand here watching this. if there's an opportunity, we should assist. i see. you know sage jutsu. you've mastered the same jutsu as jiraiya sensei. you're no pupil of pervy sage. i'll pulverize you. shadow clone jutsu. sage art: rasen shuriken. as i suspected. sage mode lasts no more than five minutes. what.. universal pull. this guy. he's taking my sage art chakra. just perfect. what was that. was someone watching. will this make you behave, my sibling pupil. naruto. i'm coming to help you. almighty push. lee. i won't let you touch naruto. that's right. hinata was on a mission outside the village. why'd you come.. hurry, get away. you'll only end up. i'm not afraid of dying, to protect naruto. naruto is my almighty push. i've experienced this countless times. people who are dear to me dying, right before my very eyes, so close i could feel their breath. share in my pain. it was just like this. my parents were killed before my very eyes, by you hidden leaf shinobi. the nine tails' power. it seems to respond to naruto's anger. do you hate me. that's fine. however, my pain is even greater than yours. almighty push. you overcame my almighty push. and in the recoil, i was. naruto. there's six tails. universal pull. the power of the nine tails is magnificent. planetary devastation. what. something inside me is. kushina, what's wrong. the nine tails. i can usually keep it stabilized, but it's irritated and unsettled now. is it because you're expending so much chakra for the four crimson rays. that's not it, ya know. i can feel it as well. next time on naruto shippuden: "comrade" there's something happening to the nine tails. jiraiya ninja scrolls: the tale of naruto the herocomrade tune in again. )
