'cause when i got electrocuted, just as i blacked out, i experienced something incredible.   what, not dying.  ..  i had a vision of the future.   look, you got shocked pretty bad.  maybe you oughta i saw the future.   how do you know it was the future.   because it hasn't happened yet.   okay, what'd you see.   well, it was hazy, but i saw myself at the groovy smoothie and that guy from galaxy wars, nug nug was there, and i saw him and me together, hugging.   i'm calling dr. quamsteen.   no.  i gotta get to the groovy smoothie and get my hug from nug nug.   wait.   what.   what's nug nug from galaxy wars gonna be doing at the groovy smoothie in seattle.   hugging me.   i'm sarah james, here with three very popular web celebrities.  their names are carly shay, sam puckett, and freddie benson, better known as icarly.   hi.   hey, food lovers.   so tell me about these spaghetti tacos.   i'm freddie benson.   well, one night my brother spencer couldn't decide whether to make us spaghetti or tacos, and so he combined 'em both and invented spaghetti tacos.   and then later he taught us how to make 'em.   well, i hope he taught you well, 'cause i'm ricky flame ..   what.   oh my god.   wait, we're on food fight right now.   yes, you are.   fantastico.   no way.   awesome.   but how did you i watched you guys make your spaghetti tacos on icarly and i wanna see if i can make 'em better.   cool, this is gonna be so fun.   yeah.  what do we get if we win.   well, i've never lost, but if you guys are good enough to beat me, you'll all win a oneyear supply of free steaks.   yeah.   wait, your definition of a year supply or my definition.   she takes her meat very seriously.   oh yes.   hey man, what's your deal.   my deal.   you hung out here all day yesterday, in your robe and slippers, and all day today and you haven't bought a thing.   i'm waiting for nug nug.   the dude from galaxy wars.   yeah.  i had a vision of the future where i saw nug nug hugging me right here in the middle of the groovy smoothie.   cool.  now, buy a smoothie or get out.   oh yeah.  in my vision i was drinking a smoothie.  why don't you get me a medium tingleberry blitz and i'll watch the door.   sounds like a plan.   okay, this food fight is winding down to a very exciting finish.  ricky flame and the icarly team are both putting the final touches on their spaghetti tacos.   ricky's tacos look better than ours.   yeah, his plating is exquisite.   ten seconds left.   okay, i'm doing it.   where's the cheese.   gimme the peruvian puff peppers.   right here, right here.   sprinkle a handful of this.  put it all over.   and time's up.   and now it's time for our three judges to decide whose spaghetti tacos reign supreme.  ..   plucky.   plump and lucky.   or super chef, ricky flame.   what is this.   my bandaid.   oh.   uhoh.   she means her flavor patch.   mmhmm.   excuse me, ma'am, i really have to go pee, but i'm expecting a small man from outer space to come here.  his name is nug nug from the planet jueveron.  so would you mind waiting here, and if you see nug nug come in, just tell him i'll right back.   crazy.   uhoh.  hey, hey.  i hope you get spacejacked by a flanch of red skynauts.   what.   it's galaxy wars talk.   nerd.   you better run.   judge eric, your thoughts.   well, i enjoyed all of these spaghetti tacos, but with ricky's, i felt his flavors were just layered more precisely.  so i have to cast my vote for ricky flame.   thank you, judge eric.   i told you we should have layered our flavors more precisely.   judge phillipe ricky, you never disappoint.  your tacos were delicious, ..  are bit soggy.   as for the icarly team, excellent taste, original presentation.  i vote for icarly.   okay, judge marla, it looks like you have the deciding vote.   come on marla.  i'm so sorry.   you know, everyone here today should feel proud of their tacos.  chef ricky, you're the best, but i liked the icarly spaghetti tacos just a little better.   oh, my goodness.  for the first time ever on "food fight," ricky flame has lost.  the icarly's spaghetti tacos have won.  congratulations, guys.   gracias.   yeah.  where are my free steaks.   you'll get 'em.   thank you.   okay, that's it for this challenge.  ..   hey, i guess we just got lucky.   i lost.   hey, can i have an autograph.  ..  unh.   he seems upset.   hey, whoa, whoa.  i think your alarm system is on fire.   nah, franklin made me get rid of my alarm system 'cause it kept blowin' fuses and shortin out the whole school.  the smoke's comin' from my gary coleman grill.   you're cooking a steak in your locker.   well, i'm not gonna eat raw meat after what happened last time.  stupid parasites.   hey, listen.  i called ricky's office, you know, to thank him for all the free steaks.   yeah.   and his assistant told me that he quit his tv show.   he's not doin' "food fight" anymore.   he's not doin' anything anymore.   what, why.   ricky's so depressed that he lost to us, he said he's giving up cooking forever.   it's not our fault ricky went psycho.   yeah, but come on, the least we can do is go talk to the guy.   no the least we can do is nothing.   we're going to talk to ricky.   agreed.   whatever.  but whatever happens, he still owes us a full year's supply of free steaks.   you know, there are more important things in life than free meat.   ..  ricky.  i'm here with the icarly kids.   argh.   come on in.   argh.   he's been like this ever since he lost to you guys.   argh.    i gotta take this.  just try to cheer him up.   ricky, come on.  so two out of three judges liked our spaghetti tacos better than yours.   uhoh.   argh.   unnecessary.   don't you have some trick that gets your mom out of bed.   yeah.   argh.   i'll try it.  get up, ya lazy blob.  there's a cop at the door and he's got a warrant.  ..i'm a loser.   here, gimme a hand.   come on, come on, sit back that's there for a reason.  there you go.   there, don't you feel better now.   yeah, i feel soooo great.   well, you just need to get outside and enjoy the sunshine and fresh air.  oh, seattle.  freddie, get the salad stuff out of the cooler.   okay.   this is dumb.   no, it's not.  we just gotta remind ricky how much fun he has cooking.  now sit him back up.   come on ricky.  sit like a big boy.   i don't wanna sit.  i'm a loser.   you're not a loser.   you're just acting like one.   remember that episode of food fight where you went to that lady's restaurant in cincinnati and you challenged her to a salad war, and your salad beat her salad and she cried.   remember how great you felt.   yeah, but that was my past.   no, you've still got it.   now, come on and show us how a real pro makes a spicy flamebo salad here's a big bowl of lettuce.
