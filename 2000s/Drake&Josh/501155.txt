pies.   and tasted everyone.   no way.  which one is the best.   number 22.   twentytwo.   but it's not as good as galini's.   not even close.   nope.   you dare call yourself a pie.   there's no reason to make the pie feel bad about itself.   yes, there is.  anyway, i just got off the phone with trudy, and she invited us to a memorial service galini down at his pie shop tomorrow night.   i don't wanna go.   me either.   i'm too full to ever go anywhere ever again.   we're all going to the service, and you wanna know why.    i don't know.   'cause remember, galini kept his pie recipe in his computer.   yeah, but she said she can never find it.   true, but i bet we know someone who could.   yeah.  if galini put that recipe in his computer, i'll bet i could find it.   yes. we're going.   wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  doesn't it make us kind of skeevy to go to a man's memorial service just so we can steal his pie recipe.   no. no, no, no, no, no. no.  see, if we find his recipe, then we can share it with the whole world.  and that way, galini's genius will live on forever.  and i got to have that pie recipe.  we're going.   galini looks at me, and he says to me, "mario," he says, "before you get married, "there's something "  where's the computer.   in the back.   and he say to me, "mario," he says, "your pants, the zipper's down.  "you don't wanna get married " now, would anyone else like to say some words.   go up there and say something.   why.   because it will give us a chance to sneak into the backroom and find the

be competing in three intense levels of brain game.  the first level is full of visual puzzles that are gonna test your ability to see things quickly.  you're gonna use the special game pod in front of you to lock in your answers and earn points for every correct answer you give.  at the end of this level, the four of you with the most points are gonna move on to level 2, whereas the other two,
