batterbatterbatter. hey, batterbatterbatter.  not yet.  i want to know where he gets his intel.  did you know the only way to tell boy penguins from girl penguins is a dna test, huh.  never mind, boys.  kid's off his wing nut.  pshaw, like we need some dna test to tell us we're 100% antarctic macho.  hooah.  listen, kid.  all i know is we've got three males and a female.  the birds know which is which.  ..    lugee hockey.  that's how a real man gives a dna sample.  am i right.  that alice, she doesn't know what she's talking about.   clearly.  but don't worry.  this dna analyzer will establish once and for all our macho manlyman machismo.   plus.  that's a male result for rico.    oh.   plus.  private's a male too.  yay.  i also am a plus, obviously.  and a big old plus sign for me.  well, that's that.    what.  you've never seen a plus sign so large and manly.  ah.  uh, how about that local sports team.  there, there, kowalski.  let mesee myget out. come on.  minus.  uh, skipper, it appears alice was right.  ..  it's you.   sorry.  no, wrong.  double wrong.  wrong infinity.  there's no way i'm a female.  all right, what you are experiencing are the five stages of grief.  right now you're in stage one, denial.  i am not.  all i'm saying is, your stupid machine is wrong.  well, it's based on scientificthen science is wrong, and you're wrong.  everybody's wrong but me.  i demand a different test.  i'm not sure it's going to be as accurate asjust do it, man.  take your time, skipper.  there's no right or wrong answer.  ..  ha.  madame.  lies.  yahha.   i see we're in stage two: anger.  thwap.  next, we should see bargaining.  private, how's about we trade dna results.  come on.  skipper, i don't think that's how itdepression. my life is over.  it's over.  it's over, over, over.  and finally acceptance.  well, i guess you got to play the hand you're dealt.  rico, hit me with a pretty pink bow.   haha.  let's move out, gentlemen.  but you'repshaw, we've moved past that, kowalski.  this doesn't change a thing about our operation.  now, come on.  we've got full mission schedule.  all right, we'll start with an easy one: massive simian hair clog in the chimp habitat drainage system.  rico, demolition.    boom.  yay.  hurrah.  yaymmm, mmm, mmm.  recover stolen souvenir shop merchandise from sewer rats.  check.  ..  skipper, what are you doing.  come on.  lady, door.  what, is chivalry dead.   ah. ah.  what's the holdup.  hang in there, skipper.  ii'm sure the zoo must have a ladies room somewhere.  i've just never really paid attention before.  you know, we could just stop and ask for directions.   what is happening to me.  curse you dna.  maurice, why is that penguin wearing a pretty pink bow on his head and shouting at the sky spirits.  and also i have a followup.  how come i do not have a pretty pink bow.  okay, i am bored for a new question already, like, where's my smoothie.  it's coming, your highness.  it looks like we just got to give the blender a second to warm up andthis second is too slow.  okay, not working.  let us move to plan h.  don't you mean plan b.  no, no, plans b through g are much too ridiculously dangerous.  plan h is that what goes down to the undertheground electrically power cables doesn't come out until the smoothie machine works again.  i like plan h.  whee.  good, mort.  now start pulling things out of other things and putting them into new things.  i'm sure it will work itself out.  okay.    ah.  oh.  in light of events, in this unit.  uh, well, i don'tnonoyes, actually.  yeah. probably so.  yeah.  but, skipper, where will you go.  on an epic quest, old friend.  i'm walking out of here a confused, naive little girl.  and i'm not coming back till i've learned to be a real woman.  so i'm thinking we start with the basic princess theory, then on to the fine art of eyelash batting.  i'm sorry. you're a girl.  open your mind, sister.  i'm here for help.  at being a girl, which i guess you are.  exactly.  and i need you to teach me all the girly stuff, you know, like, makeovers and poodle skirts.  wait, whoa, whoa, whahehheh.  that's your idea of girl stuff.  what, it's more about lip gloss these days.  big problemo, sister.  i've got no lips.  skipper, if you're a girl, then girl stuff is, well, whatever you like doing.  if you're into the commando thing, being a girl doesn't change that.  course not.  just means now i'm no good at it.  now, pass me some chiffon, doll face.  i got a hankering to sew me some curtains.    um, shouldn't you be looking into that.  land sakes, no.  that sounded dangerous.  how about we stay here and gossip about boys. )
