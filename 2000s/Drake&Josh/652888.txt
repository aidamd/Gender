little girl, which was to give h and her foster family the best christmas ever.   which he cannot do without the help of his less appealing brother.   feelings watch your mouth, boy.   yes, i understand.  but madam if you put these boys in jail, you'll be directly preventing them for fulfilling their responsibility, which in turn, will make you equally responsible for breaking a christmas promise to a brighteyed little girl who's sweet like sugar and smells like shampoo.   this little girl.   mmhmm.   you can't break a christmas promise.   yeah.  you can't break a christmas promise.

i'll tell you this, on christmas day, i will personally ask johansson and her foster family to vote yes or no, as to whether they did or did not have the best christmas ever.  and if that vote is not unanimously yes, i will personally take you both back to prison.   okay.  somebody's got a case of the grumpies.   stop. stop hitting.   ahh.   stop hitting.  stop it. i'm talking. stop it.   all right. all right.   idiots.  also ha by court order, you're forbidden to tell the children about the vote ahead of time as it could influence their answers.   why do we have to wear ankle bracelets.   so i can monitor your location every minute of every day.   okay.  just three quick questions about the ankle bracelet.  one, when i take a bath out.   you're hurting my arm.  hello. you're hurting my

feet.   hang on.   i hate you drake parker.   i don't think this thing is worth six dollars.   listen, having an awesome christmas is all about the presents.   okay.  first, we have no money, which makes it kind of hard to buy presents.  and second, you promised this little girl the best christmas ever.  and chrimas is about a whole lot more than just getting stuff.   okay, fine.  you go ahead and do your wienerish traditional stuff, and i'll find a way to get us some money so we can actually buy the kid somewhat is it.   what.   what. oh, it's you.  what's this.   ticket for reckless

harder to place, you know, the more challenging ones.   yeah, they are an interesting group.   yeah, they are.  they're all nice kids.  good hearts.  i think it's really great that you and your brother are gonna try and give them a fun christmas.   thanks.  oh, and you know, you can't tell them about the vote or the court stuff or oh, believe me, i know.  officer gilbert came by the house.  practically threatened me with prison if i tell the kids about the vote.   yeah.   hey, listen, i wanna swing by the hospital and visit leslie before work so.   okay.   if you need to use the van, the

it.   stop it.  go. why do it.   if they like making the pop sound, what's wrong with the best christmas ever, that's our mission.   look, i just think if when the court asks those kids if they had the best christmas, do you really think they're gonna say yes if all we gave them is  okay, first of all, you're doing it wrong.  all right.  you got to curve your finger, puff your cheeks out.  puff

brother and i are trying to do is give the kids the best christmas they ever had.  it's like officer gilbert, your son, just hates us.   oh, i'm sure perry doesn't hate you.  he hates christmas.   but why.   it goes back when he was just eight years old.  as a little boy, he loved christmas so much.  and there's one present he always wanted more than any other.   what was it.   a monkey.   a monkey.   it was christmas eve, perry woke up in the wee hours of the morning.  and as children will do, he sneaked out of his bedroom and into the den to see what santa had left him.  there, by our christmas tree, was a fine monkey in a cage.  it was the present perry had dreamed of.  then, perry turned the latch and opened the cage and that when things went terribly wrong.  the monkey went berserk.  bad monkey.  and then, the tinkling.  its bladder empty, the monkey jumped out the window, never to be seen again.   that is the freakiest story i've ever heard.   i know, but it's true.  christmas was ruined for him as a kid.  so now, he wants to ruin it for everyone else.   so, we're screwed.   no.  we're going to fix this.  all we have to do is give him a really nice monkey for christmas.  check this out.   myssweetmonkey.com.   placing sweet monkeys with families since 2005.  and look, each monkey comes with its own certificate of sweetness.   sweet.   we want to get on the
