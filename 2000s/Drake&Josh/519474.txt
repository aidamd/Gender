run. no, pass. don't pass. pass.  not the sack. not the sack.  man on tv: unh. the sack.  oh, the sack.  what are you doing.  i'm trying to learn how to play football.  oh. 4007.  at least you made one touchdown.  no, megan did.  i had to use the bathroom, so i let her play for a while.  i can't believe you volunteered me to play football.  you know how easily i bruise.  dude, i did you a favor.  playing football is way cooler than managing equipment.  and who knows. maybe you'll do ok.  we're playing lincoln.  last week they tackled a guy so hard, he had to go back to the fourth grade.  so.  i hated the fourth grade.  it was my awkward stage.  ..  i'm not playing.  i'm telling coach i quit.  you can't quit.  why not.  because if you quit, that means we forfeit.  if we forfeit, everyone at school is going to hate you.  and worse, i'm going to be the brother of the most hated guy in school.  but i'm not ready to die.  i haven't seen paris.  they eat snails. the people smell bad.  you don't want to go there.  please. you've got to get me out of this.  i want to be cooler, but i can't go out there and play against the toughest team in the state.  ok, ok.  he's thinking. he's thinking.  he's snapping.  i got an idea.  he's got an idea.  ok, you need to stop that.  done.  ok, you won't die if you don't play.  so i'm not going to play.  oh, you're going to play.  it's just not going to be you.  he's confusing me.  drake.  what.  being in school at night, it creeps me out.  really.  i feel that way about school during the day.  oh, good, here's the janitor.  ah, yes, the janitor.  why is that good.  because that's not just any janitor.  that's zeke braxton.  zeke braxton.  yeah, he used to be a great pro football player until a head injury ruined his career.  and his memory.  now he can barely remember anything.  come on.  who are you kids.  i'm drake.  and you are. josh.  and i am.  zeke. you're zeke.  right. and you are.  we'll tell you later.  look, we have a little problem and we need your help.  does it involve balloons.  no.  anyway, look, tomorrow night our school's playing football against lincoln.  and since you used to play football i used to play football.  so tomorrow night, you put on josh's uniform and play center in the game.  wait, who is this "josh" you speak of.  him.  me.  nice to meet you.  and you are.  drake, this will never work.  yes, it will.  once he has your helmet on, everyone will think it's you.  ohh.  so, what do you say, zeke. will you do it.  yeah, i'll do it. for $10,000.  deal.  .  where are we going to get $10,000.  he's not going to remember.  what if he does.  hey, who are you kids, and what are you doing in my chocolate factory.   i think this can work.  now i know the lincoln team is bigger than you, and clearly more talented than you.  but i want you kids to go out there and win this game.  because if we make the playoffs, the principal promised me a used karaoke machine.  and you guys know i wanted to be a singer, right.  players: yeah.  so i need this karaoke machine.  i've got nothing else to live for.  nothing.  hands in.  1, 2, 3.    oh.  finally. where have you been.  i couldn't find zeke anywhere.  who's zeke.  you are.  give him your jersey.  all right, you know what to do, right.  corn on the cob.  you really think this is going to work.  zeke plays, everyone thinks it's you, you're instantly cool.  coach: hey, where's nichols.  get out there.  play your heart out, zeke. make me look good.  all right. unh. help.  ok, 123, pull.  feels good.  yeah, it does.    shower.   hey.  zeke. the game.  what game.  just run that way and play football.  i'll do it.   corn on the cob.  i don't know.  how is he, doc. can he play.  doesn't look like it.  he's got a pretty bad concussion.  i should go notify his parents.  ok, doc.  hey, didn't you want to be a singer.  .  oh, well, so much for my used karaoke machine.  i've got to tell the rest we're going to forfeit.  zeke, are you ok.  unh.  are you all right.  i got hit so hard, it's all coming back to me now.  i'm zeke braxton.  i'm a janitor.  i'm a janitor.  hey, you guys owe me 10,000 bucks.  oh, well, looks like i'm on.  what are you talking about.  if i don't play, we forfeit.  who cares. you don't have to go out there.  everybody already thinks you played.  you're cool.  it's not about me.  it's about the team. i've got to play.  now hurry, help me.  you're going to get murdered out there.  yeah, probably.  but i can't let my teammates and the whole school down.  i've got to do this.  hey, you know what, josh.  you're pretty cool.  the cooliest.  don't ruin it.  right.  well, here goes nothin'.   ..  remember me as i was.  will do, brother.    you did it, josh. you did it.  awesome.  what did i do.  you scored the winning touchdown.  really.  but i thought that guy from lincoln tackled me.  but he hit you so hard that he actually knocked you 20 yards into the end zone.  you won the game.  here, kid, this is for you.  i get the game ball.  heck, yeah, you deserve it.  besides, a couple of your teeth are lodged in there.  but the most important thing is, josh, i'm getting me a used karaoke machine.   beautiful dreamer   you did great out there, man. you're a hero.  hey, drake, come here.  closer.  tada.  joshakazaam.  ro westbro @k+pppw @@ w r pw @ hhhh  ohhh  pow.. sm  )
