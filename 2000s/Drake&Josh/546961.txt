pieces of sushi off the conveyor belt and place them into these containers here.  then you place the containers back on the line there.  six pieces of sushi to one container.  now, if any sushi passes through there unboxed, you will be fined and forcibly escorted through that door there.  any questions.    yeah i don't have time for questions.  sit.  let the sushi roll.    i get it.  sushi roll.
