  hey, josh, would you get down we're gonna be late for the wedding.  josh.  can we just go.   why are you in such a hurry.   because i want aunt catherine's beach house bad.   yeah, so do i.   then we can't be late for the wedding, and we have to pick up the cake.   dude, we have plenty of time.  just as long as we get to the bakery beforehey, have you seen my laptop i thought i left it right here.   i gave it to craig and eric.   you what.   they told me you said it was cool.   well, yes, i sad it was cool for them to borrow my computer.  but why'd you give them the it had my cell phone in it and my keys to mom's suv.  now we have no car.   well, i'll just call craig and eric and tell them to come back.  they don't have cell phones.   why.   'cause papa nichols threw eric's against the wall and broke it, and craig's mom thinks cell phones cause ear sores.   well, craig does get a lot of ear sores.   we cannot be late to this wedding.  ..ok, um...trevor.   what about trevor.   we'll borrow his car.   his girlfriend sleeps in it.  she sleeps in some other guy's car now.   i don't want to go to a wedding in trevor's el camino.  it's old and gross.   so is aunt catherine.   drake, if we don't dude, it runs, and the wedding cake will fit in the the most important thing is it'll get us there on time.     it won't start.   oh, really.  the good news is we're right near nothing.   ok, how was i supposed to know trevor's car would break down, huh.   it was built in the 1970s. it has over 300,000 miles on it.  anyone with a second grade education could have guessed it would die.   you're so mean to me sometimes.   look, we can't be late to aunt catherine's wedding, all we promised mom and dad and if we're not there in 48 minutes, there's no way we're gonna get that beach house.  we'll just call give me your cell phone.   my cell phone was in my bag, which you gave to craig and what, you don't have your cell phone.   no. mine got ruined.   how.  ..fell in a bowl of soup at school.   who accidentally drops their cell phone into their soup.  i wanted to see if it would float.   how do you even get dressed by yourself.   all right, look, you wanna play pick on drake or do you wanna figure out how to get to this wedding on time.   how are we gonna do that if it's 14 miles to the next gas station.   look, maybe i can fix the motor.   you can't fix a sandwich.   if you make fun of me one more time, i'm gonna tell everyone we know that you named your favorite pillow mr.  puffpuff.   i'm sorry if i offended you.  now let's check under the hood.   ok.   well, there's the motor.   yes.  a lot of metal there.   a lot of metal.   i think i see the problem.  look here.  yeah, that belt came off.  so what do we do about it.  here, i'll just put the belt back on this pulley thing and you get in the car, and when i say go, you try to start it.   all right. cool.   all righty.   i didn't say go. i didn't say go. hey. aah.  ow. ow.    oh. aah.  whoa. whoa. no, no, no.   come on, baby, come on, baby.  come on.   no, no, no.  aah.  no.  aah.   all right, the motor's running. where's your jacket.   it ate my jacket.  well, at least we got motor running.   i gotta get my jacket back.   i think that was your jacket.  ..  see what i can do here.  all right.   would you stop touching me.  oh, man, we got 43 minutes until let's try to get this stupid motor running again.   right.   man, it's so dark in there, i can barely see anything.   yeah, let me check the glove see if trevor has a flashlight in there.   oh, yeah. good call.   you locked the keys in the car.   don't hate me.   i don't hate you.  here.   what's this.   big rock.   what do you want me to do with it.   kill me.

out of this if we're all full of urine, so let's go pee.  ooh, that cactus looks nice.   yeah, that's a good one.  come on.   looks like somebody parked here illegally.   i'll write 'em a ticket.   how come i never met your wife.   huh.   you know, we've been working together for, like, 3 years now, and i just think it's weird that you never let me meet your wife.  ..she's just, ..she's just shy.   you're not really married, are you.   what.  of course i am.  you can't just pretend to be married and not have a wife.  what are you talking about.   let me meet her.  i'm not married. there's no marissa.   you made up marissa.  there was a marissa, in the ninth grade.  and i asked her to the school ..  she just laughed at me.   it's ok, buddy. i understand.   i feel so dumb.   wait. wait. please.  stop. help.  oh.   i can't believe we missed em.   and we got a parking ticket.  how much time we have to get to the wedding.  i don't see how there's any way we're gonnahey. hey, headlights.

where you guys headed.   to our aunt catherine's wedding.   but we gotta be there in less than half an hour.   yeah, with that cake.   or we are in big trouble.   well, did you call for help.  we don't have cell phones.   but if you drive us to the nearest pay phone, we'll give you 75 bucks.   oh, wait, wait, wait.  ..an extra 40.  that's almost 100 bucks.   will you please drive us.  so you

look, even if we're late, maybe if we get the cake to the reception on time, aunt catherine won't be too mad.   or maybe she'll be furious and we'll never get that beach house.   man, it's getting cold out here.  i think i saw an old blanket in the back of the car.  hey. hey, guess what i found.   fried chicken.  ..  i did find a tool box.  what are we gonna do with tools.   we can use them to get us into the car that you locked us out of.   ok. just open the box.  anything good.  an emergency kit.  and you always all right, open it up and see what's inside.   all right, i'm opening it.  ..

 i mean, leslie's a girl's name.   oh, is that what you think.   what my brother meant to say was we don't think leslie's a we think it's a guy's name, dude. a man's name.  a very man's name.  leslie's totally silence.   listen, boy, i was named after my father, he was named after his father, and they both fought in wars.  all i'm saying is i've all girls.  you know, i'll tell you you can rot in a sack for all i care. goodbye.   no. no, no, no. please. wait.  don't leave.   rot in a sack.   you had to make fun of the man's name.   well, at least we can get in maybe we can get it started.   we already tried that.   well, let's try it again, all get in the car and turn the key.   fine.   i'll look under the hood and see if i can figure out what the problem is.  all right, go.   i think i see what the problem is. come here.   you really think you see the problem.  see, when you turn the key and it was trying to start, that thing was hitting against that thing.   that thing there.  and see those 2 wires right there.   yeah.   i think they got pulled loose when that thing knocked against that thing.   oh, well, maybe we just need to reconnect those wires and pull that metal thing back.   right.    there.   let's give it a shot.   all right.   cross your fingers.   i'm crossing everything i got.   all right.     yes.   all right. whoo.   ha ha. yes. ok, ok, ok, ok.
