nickelodeon narrator: oh, a dark and stormy night.  it's nights like this that remind me of the time mr. krabs and spongebob thought they killed the health inspector.  it was a bright and sunny morning...  ah...   that smells like...   the health inspector.  wash your hands, clean the floors change your underwear.  the health inspector's here.  if he finds one health violation he'll close us down for good.  we've got to do everything in our power to make sure he passes the krusty krab.  but, mr. krabs, there's no reason to worry.  the krusty krab is the most perfect place in the universe.  you really haven't got any brains at all, have you, son.  just go out there and give him what he needs.  pour on the charm.  sweettalk him.  what can i get for you... handsome.  we're doomed.  i'm going to need you to bring me one of everything on the menu.  excellent choice, my darling.  coming right up.  he wants one of everything.  then we'll give him a smorgasbord.  the future of the krusty krab is at stake.  try the crunchy kelp dogs, sir.  the buttered barnacles are heaven.  the powdered driftwood is exquisite.  sludge pudding.  more diet red tide.  fried flotsam.  please, gentlemen.   leave me to finish my work in peace.   and did the voluptuous inspector enjoy his meal.  so far so good.  i just need to try a plain krabby patty and my inspection will be finished.  he says if he gets one more krabby patty he'll pass us for the inspection.  do you know what this means, dear boy.  we're in the clear.   tv announcer: we interrupt this cancan for a special news bulletin.  be on the lookout for a man who's been passing himself off as a health inspector in order to obtain free food.  that's all for now.  free... food...  maybe we ought to tell our guy about the phony impostor.  you loony loofah. heisthe impostor.  we've been duped.  duped.  bamboozled.  smeckledorfed.  that's not even a word and i agree with ya.  look at him...  i bet he never changes his underpants.  spongebob: i bet he bites whale bubbles.  i bet his mom bought him that hat.  if that impostor wants a krabby patty...  then, by neptune, we'll give him one.  you're dancing with the krab man now.  join me, boy, or you're fired.  it doesn't seem right...  but it feels so good.  sea horse radish, the gnarliest stuff in the ocean.  oh, hold on. i've got a jar of toenail clippings in my office.  oops, i dropped it in the toilet.  well, fish it out and i'll dry it with me gym socks.   mr. krabs: why, that's the most diabolical krabby patty ever spawned.  i call it... the nasty patty.   hey, hurry up with that patty.  here you are sir, enjoy.  ah. hello, delicious.  come to papa.    listen. he ate it.  look at him choke.    look at him suffer.     did you see that boy.  oh, man, the look on his face.      tv announcer we interrupt your laughter at other people's expense to bring you this news flash.  the fake inspector has been captured.  here is his picture.  if a health inspector comes to your restaurant and he's not this guy... he's real.  phew. that's a relief, eh, mr. krabs.  i'm sure our guy will understand if we just explain the situation.  then we can all have a good laugh about it.   i don't think he'll be laughing, boy.  why, sir.  because that patty killed him.    mr. krabs, what are we gonna do.  what's this "we" stuff.  you fed him the tainted patty.  looks like it's the stony lonesome for you.  but you told me to give it to him.  well, you could have talked me out of it.  you're right, mr. krabs... i'm guilty.  i'll never survive in prison.  they'll mop up the floor with me.  get a hold of yerself, boy.  we got to get rid of this body before anyone sees it.  we got to take it out and bury it.  eww, gross, germs.  it's all icky and corpsey.    eww... eww...  this should be far enough.  now, get diggin'.  yes, sir.   what's the holdup down there there's a big rock in the way.  well, toss it out and get back to diggin'.  aye, aye, sir.   oh... where am i.   somethin' ain't quite right.  what do you mean, mr. krabs.  his head's sticking out.  sorry, mr. krabs, i thought he might need some air.  they don't need air where he's goin'.  shouldn't we say a few words on his behalf.  uh... he was a credit to health inspectors everywhere, and, uh...  what a brave man, going in the line of duty like that.  why... why... why....  listen here, ya little barnacle.  no one, and i meanno one can ever know about this.  it'll be the end of you, it'll be the end of me.  and worst of all, it'll be the end of me.  man: stop right where you are.  i'm afraid we're gonna have to arrest the two of you.  mr. krabs. i'm too young to go to jail.  and what would be the charges.  for not being at the krusty krab to whip us up a couple of dee...licious krabby patties.    : laugh, boy.    put that muddy shovel in the trunk and we'll give you a ride back.   spongebob, listen carefully.  we're just getting a lift back to the krusty krab.  i need you to stay calm and don't lose your cool, understand.  can i lose my cool now.  why.  both: aah.  put him in the trunk, boy.  i'll keep them cops busy.  man: what's the holdup back there.  oh, neptune.  get aw.  ooh... ahhahh...  ahem...  okay. all set back here.  nothing unusual about a muddy shovel in the trunk.   all set.  ahh...  you okay there, little fella.  ooh, he gets carsick real easy.  well, buckle up and we'll drive real smoothlike.   now listen, spongebob when we get to the krusty krab i want you to take thatshovel and bring it around to the back entrance and stuff... er... i mean,stow it in the freezer.  un... der... stand.  i understand, mr. krabs but what do you want me to do with the bo...  ...tles of soda. bottles of soda.  same thing, put 'em in the freezer.  oh...   eww... eww... eww...  oh, man, this is so gross. )
