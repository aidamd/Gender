"this week on 'before they were bad girls' the lizzie mcguire story. " lizzie mcguire started out life as a good girl. she had it all friends, family, and 3way calling. lizzie was such a good baby. the way she napped. and not once not once did she ever eat dirt. yeah, she always ate her vegetables, finished her milk, laughed a lot. so goodnatured. she was a good kid. you guys, this is ridiculous. it's for your own good, lizzie. fast forward to middle school, where lizzie went from good baby to good girl. we were best friendsate lunch together every day, had slumber parties. i still have the first friendship bracelet she gave me on the first day of middle school. but the good days came crashing down when she met a devil named angel. everything was fine until lizzie got detention. lizzie mcguire. lizziewhat exactly was she in for. she was in for cheating at math, but soon she'd be cheating at life. she used to live up there. now she lives out there on the street. the horror. lizzie planned on going to parties she was too young for, put earrings in places they're not meant to be. forgery, ditching, and lying became a way of life. lizzie got too fast for even the fast crowd. if we don't stop her now, she could end up in jailor worse. which is why we made this film. for you, lizzie mcguire. so, what do you think. i can't believe you guys took so much time to make such a bad movie. i thought you said this would work. i do have to say i think it's pretty cool that you guys are so much about me, and you did go through all that trouble, but i have to ask has my hair always looked that bad. you mean to tell me that you're actually okay with the ditching and all that other stuff. actually, no. i mean, being a bad girl all the time is hard work. i guess i really am just a good girl at heart. note to self next time i walk on the wild side, wear comfy shoes. so next friday, the usual. popcorn and a rental at my house. sounds g. t. m. ooh. never mind. sounds good to me. hey, friz, did you get the answers for the test from gordork. okay, "a," my name is lizzie, not friz. "b," gordo's no dork. he's one of my best friends. and "c," i don't cheat. fine. but if you think you're gonna be in my band now, you're so not. and you, lizzie mcguire, are never going to "l" squared. oh. i think i'll live. staying up late again tonight. no way. i'm exhausted. i asked mom and dad to give me back my bedtime. funny. in a way, i just got my bedtime back, too. you are really dumb. no. but sometimes it may seem that way. no. you really are. hey. i was there first. too bad. i'm bigger. too bad. i'm faster. i got it. you guys, this is ridiculous. this is for you own you're still gonna ride your studer. . i am going to a high school party. i just messed that line up. and they all i am a good girl. good girls don't get detention. opps. toast is evil. )
