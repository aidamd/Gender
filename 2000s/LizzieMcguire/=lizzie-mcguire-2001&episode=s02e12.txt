fantastic, mom. and you got these on sale. honey, i spent less on all this stuff than i would've spent on that one pair of pants from the style shack. now you go out there and you win best dressed. yeah. oh. hey, you don't want to go in there. the toilet's overflowed. oh. so how many clubs have you gotten into so far. lots. and i just slipped into the safety patrol picture. wow. lizzie, those

toilet paper in the kitchen cabinet. well, i save money buying the 50roll package but i ran out of places to put all of them. oh. let me help you. hey. did kate win best dressed. no. claire did. but that's okay. it is. yeah, because, um, by the end of the day every girl in school wanted to know where i had gotten my clothes from. that's great. but the problem is i don't know where my new clothes came from. and i really wish i did because that would've meant that i would've spent a whole great day shopping with you. mom, i really want you to know that i appreciate everything that you did. and next time you go bargain hunting would it be okay if i came with you. i would love that. me too. a new pair of hip huggers from the style shack: $65. a more popular pair of hip huggers from nell's
