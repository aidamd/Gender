playing any time i want to, but i'm not going to just because you say so. i'm outta here. man, that's one bad dwarflord jones. what do you know about it. it's a cool game, but it can take you down a bad road. last year, lanny was seriously on the dwarf. spent all his money on collectors' cards, talked nonstop about his characters. that dwarflord is bad medicine. i just hope he can get over it. you can hope. and you can hope a grizzly bear doesn't eat you if you rub yourself with bacon. gordo's a dwarfhead. he needs help. so will you help him. it won't be easy. it will be intense it will be ugly. but, gordo helped me that time i got my head stuck in the banister. i owe him one. ii hate to bother you, but i really think edward left his cellphone at home on purpose so i couldn't call him.

aversion therapy. the thing you like causes you pain. therefore, you don't like it anymore. what are the wires for. well, the wires are for absolutely nothing. they just look pretty cool. well, if you don't cut this out, i'm gonna cause you pain. okay. moving on to the next step. ow. i just wanted to do one. it looked fun. why are you doing this. because we want you back the way you were. back in the old days, when you ate and slept and talked like a normal person. maybe i just like dwarflord. well, maybe you do, but if you don't change, you're gonna end up like this. alvin steck he's a
