oh. hey, guys. i didn't know you were coming over. yeah, we missed you at school. how are you feeling. much better. i'll be back at school tomorrow. well, we brought by your homework. suddenly i don't feel so good. nurse. gordo, i've been sick one day. how much did i miss. well, mr. pettus's lab coat caught on fire. iis he okay. oh, yeah. it was intentional: part of hislab safety lecture. that"stop, drop and roll" really does work. yeow. mr. dig was our sub in english. instead of writing our book reports he had us play 20 questions and guess what everyone had read. cool. yeah, but you still have to do your book report. oh. why is it that school's only fun when i'm not there. you guys aren't making me feel any better. okay, so english, science what did i miss in social studies. well, mrs. stebel gave us a kind of cool project. see, everyone in class was paired up and assigned a country. we're supposed to do a report and bring in a native dish. it's mrs. stebel's potluck u. n. oh, cool. what country are we doing. well we're doing mexico. oh. so, what are we cooking. tamales. you guys are paired together, aren't you. yeah. so, who am i paired with. well, do you want the good news or the bad news first. give me the bad news, doc. i can take it. who am i paired with. well, the good news is you'll be exploring the wonderful world of latvia. who am i paired with.. well, you see kate was absent from school today, too. kate. what did i expect. that's really bad news. i have to be paired with kate. yeah. well, she's taking that better than i expected. if you believe we've got a pictureperfect plan we've got you fooled 'cause we only do the best we can and sometimes we make it and sometimes we fake it but we get one step closer each and every day we'll figure it out on the way. lizzie mcguire s01e28 lizzie and kate's big adventure hey, i thought you were going to school today. aren't you feeling any better yet. no. i'm feeling worse. what a coincidence. you're looking worse, too but i don't think that has anything to do with being sick. i should've stayed in bed. i'm going back upstairs. no, no. your mistake was coming downstairs. the key is to stay in bed until they come get you. amateur. this wouldn't have anything to do with a certain social studies project where you have to work with kate sanders, would it. no. yes. hhow did you know. i'm a mom. we have our ways. mrs. sanders called last night. the cia has got nothing on the united mom front. this is so unfair. i miss one day of school, and gordo and miranda don't cover for me so now i'm being punished by having to work with kate. you know, sweetie if you have this much energy at home you're probably well enough to go to school. mom. honey, you and kate are going to have to put your differences aside and work together. that's impossible. you don't work with kate, you work for her. you used to be friends. you must have something in common. yeah. we can't stand each other. go upstairs, put your clothes on. you're going to be late for school. you're going to have a really bad day. your day's going to be over if you don't shut your mouth. so i took some books out from the library for our oral report. did you get the tamale recipe from your mom. yeah. she's going to help us make them after school. this project reeks. not only do i have to work with kate but come to find out latvia is the food capital of jellied meat. aah. this day couldn't get any worse. well, it's about to. hurricane kate's here. look, i know we have to work together this is the way it's going to work: i spend as little time with you as necessary we don't work in public and i am so not making jellied meat. negotiations are tricky between hostile forces but i accept her demands. fine. why don't you meet at my house after school. that sounds good. i can't possibly run into anyone popular there. but you remember where it is, right. i'll see you after school. i cannot believe i have to work with her. well, that wasn't so bad. i think you handled it very well. yeah, because i didn't have any help from you guys. look, it's no big deal. all you have to do is give a report and make some food. easy for him to say. he doesn't have to cook with katezilla. it'll be okay. i think. i had the weirdest dream last night that mrs. mcgee was out sick and we didn't have take our math test. matt, mrs. mcgee is out sick and we don't have to take our math test. that's weird. definitely weird. but the weirdest part of the dream was that the substitute wore these big, red shoes like, like clown shoes. oscar do you know what this means. that our substitute can get us free tickets to the circus. no. well, maybei don't knowbut what i do know: i can predict the future. i'm psychic. so, is kate there yet. obviously not. i'm still in one piece. so, what are you guys doing. oh, we're just doing research. i'm doing research. you're talking on the phone. aah. oh. sounds like you guys are having fun. no, no, we're not having fun. yes, uh, there's no fun to be had here. oh, that's probably kate. i got to go. why. you a member of her posse now. no, but she is my partner on this project thanks to you guys. sorry. sure you are. lizzie, what do you want me to do. what do i want you to do. i want you to build a time machine go back to yesterday's class and when mrs. stebel asks who's going be lizzie's partner raise your hand. there's nothing you can do. i'll see you tomorrowif i survive today. kate, we haven't seen you around here in so long. it really has been too long, mrs. mcguire. so, what have you been up to. oh, i've been really busy. oh, there she is. i know you've got a lot of work to do, so i'll let you get right to it. look, i don't want to work with you any more than you want to work with me, okay. doubt it. that's it. the gloves are coming off. you know, you weren't my first choice, either. i got stuck with you was because i was sick and my friends weren't looking out for me. you think your friends are bad. i was sick and claire picked ethan over me. so now i'm stuck with you. i hate my friends. whoa. did we just agree on something. that's scary. uh, wwe'd better get to work. yeah. step right up. have your fortune told by the amazing matt. oscar, bring in the next group. save your money. i predict you will be buying an expensive gift. i see a haircut in your immediate future. i see you going on a long, long trip. man, this is a ripoff. whoever owns this backpack is paying for a new window. what can i say. i'm the real deal. we could make grey peas and fried meat. what's in that. grey peas and fried meat. ugh. i don't even like green peas. why couldn't we get france. all we'd have to do is go buy some bread and sparkling juice. and fries. you guys seem like you're having fun. i don't know if "fun" is the word. just wait till tomorrow when we actually have to cook something latvian. wow, this is like old times. i didn't realize it was so late. i got to motor. can't be late for cheerleading practice. yeah, yyou'd better go. yeah. well bye. ssee you tomorrow. what was that. what was what. when i walked in, you looked like you were getting along. like when you used to be friends. mom, we weren't getting along. we were just studying. oh, okay, sure you were. face it, she's a cheerleader, i'm not. you just can't upset the natural order of things. hey, guys. she lives. i knew you'd make it. so, how'd it go. it was the most horrible experience of my life. okay, okay, it was kind of fun. it wasn't terrible. see, it's all in your attitude. yeah, but we're sorry about sticking you with kate, though. we should have been looking out for you. i didn't want to work with kate. well, anyway, i bet she makes you do all the research, right. no, she doesn't. yeah, just wait till you start cooking in the kitchen. she'll be too worried about breaking a nail. i think it'll be okay. well, we're going to be doing our research at the digital bean after school if you want some katefree time. oh, actually kate and i are meeting at the digital bean to finish our project. wait, i thought she didn't want to be seen with you in public. it's not like i want to hang out with her either but the digital bean has dsl. on my computer, it took us, like, 45 minutes to download this latvia site. come to find out it was this fan club for this eastern european supermodel. news. news. news. news. how do you do that. dad, i'm psychic. sam, it is 4:00. there is nothing but news on i could tell you that. sam but you're not psychic. neither are you. i knew she was going to say that. really. well have you got any idea about tomorrow's lottery numbers. one two. three. sam, put the pen down. he is not psychic. am, too. okay, tell me what i'm thinking. you're thinking you're thinking you're going to send me to my room. so. lucky guess. matt, you're not psychici'm predictable. say what you will, but being psychic isn't exactly fun. it's a huge responsibility knowing what the future holds. you know, he's right. that is a huge responsibility. sam, he is not psychic. he cannot read minds or predict the future. stop encouraging him. don't believe her, dad. now, that was spooky. it wasn't spooky, it was coincidence. i am going to prove to both of you that he is not psychic. am, too. i'll be so glad when this project is over tomorrow. so what are we making. um we can make sult. it's only four letters. how hard could it be. what's in it. uh hang on. ugh. veal and jelly. ew. i cannot believe how quick this connection is. wait. go back. aleksander torte. that doesn't look too bad. we can pronounce it and it doesn't involve any jellied meat. coolie. wow. when separated from the shebeasts kate reverts back to human from. hey, lizzie. who's your new friend. don't worry, we won't call attention to the fact that you two are out together in public. come on, you guys, we're trying to study here. come on, gordo, we got to go finish our tamales. i can't believe that those are your friends. kate are we slumming. we're just working on our social studies project. i didn't get to choose my partner. well, ethan and i are having a great time. we're making chinese. anyway, call me when you climb back up the social ladder. later. i can't believe those are your friends. you obviously don't know what it's like to be popular. but when backed into a corner shebeasts come out fighting. coming here was a total mistake. let's print out that recipe and go before anyone else sees us. mom and dad, i'm psychic. why can't you just be supportive. i'm supportive. well, i'm supportive too, honey, but you're not psychic. but everything i say comes true. honey, it's just a coincidence and i'm going to prove to you that you're not psychicto both of you. can you see anything. uh no, i'm blindfolded. how many fingers is your father holding up. three. i'm right, aren't i. sam, is he right. yeah. now mom's upset because dad didn't lie to me and tell me that i got the wrong answer. i'm not upset. you seem a little upset. i'll be in my room. no. you wait right here. i am going to prove to you that you are not psychic. sit down. i knew that was going to happen. lizzie. kate. let's just get this over with. fine, we'll make the torte and it will be over. watch out. coming through. careful. sorry. tell me why i wore something brand new to bake in. whoa, it's like deja vu all over again. because you always do. what are you talking about. do you remember your ninth birthday party. sleepover. you and miranda were there. yeah. you got that baby spice shirt that you wanted so bad. yeah, and i had to put it on right away. after your mom told you not to. 'cause we were baking cookies. oh, we made a total mess. she had to wash that shirt like four times before the egg finally came out. it was my alltime favorite shirt. who gave that to me. i did. i'm psychic. i can see all. matt. ew. i i didn't see that coming. i don't know what you're thinking. really. 'cause you should. i think i've lost the gift. i'll be in my room. wow, he really isn't psychic anymore. do you girls need any help cleaning this mess up. no, it's okay. it's just a few eggs. we've got it under control. okay. we should go talk to matt. i wonder if he knows we're coming. so, how's your outfit. any egg. no. eggfree. um, kate i hate to break it to you but you're no longer eggfree. you should see yourself, mcguire. now, this is just like your ninth birthday. yeah, but we have to have a sleepover and stay up all night talking. remember when your mom kept coming downstairs telling us to go to bed. yeah, that was so much fun. what did we talk about. everything. school. junior high. boys. and how we'd always be friends. what happened. i don't know. oh, i know. she got popular. one summer you went off to camp and when you came back everything was different. i guess it was. and then we just we weren't friends anymore. it's weird how that happens. yeah, it is. seems kind of dumb. yeah. it it does. latvia's, like, been controlled by many other countries. but, they became independent in august of 1991. their cuisine has been heavily influenced by russia. so there's a lot of overlap in traditional eastern european foods. we made aleksander torte which is a pastry filled with raspberry. so if anyone's brave enough, come try a piece. hey, this is so not bad. yeah, we made a pretty good team. yeah, we did. so, claire miss someone bossing you around. strike one. kate, are you done hanging out in dorktown. because i think loser is contagious. strike two. you couldn't even spell "contagious. " strike three. well. and you're out. nice working with you. not. weren't you leaving now. geek. snob. did i really think things were going to change. after all, this is junior high. did we already apologize for leaving you with kate. i couldn't even imagine the pain you had to go through. so when i make a big mistake when i fall flat on my face i know i'll be all right nothin' changes who i am. no, you probably couldn't.  nice talk work what. nice working with you. okay. hit it. ii'm ahh. easy for him to say. he doesn't have to cook with katezilla. yeah, right. just wait till tomorrow when we actually have to cook something just wait till tomorrow when we actually have to cook something man. go hilary. go me. )
