"to celebrate your riches you'll find this treasure buried at the end of the test. " hello. lizzie. ooh, it's miranda. i hope she's calling to make up. yeah. oops, i, um, i didn't mean to call you. habit, i guess. she totally called to apologize. so, um, do you have anything to say to me like an apology. hmm. let me think a minute. not even. me apologize to you. i think that you should be the one to apologize to me. i don't think so. well, then, fine. fine. ethan your hair is just amazing. yeah. it kind of glows. well, thank you, mr. and mrs. mcg. do you use conditioner. no, but i'll fill you in. you know how on the shampoo bottle has directions, right. lather, rinse, repeat. yeah. i don't repeat. he doesn't repeat. interesting. and yet it still gets clean. they only put "repeat" on the bottle so you buy more shampoo. oh. wow. tricky. tricky. hey, ethan. it's almost 9:00. i've got my skates on. you ready to roll. goness. and remember, mr. and mrs. mcg: don't repeat. got it. right. be careful. okay, the coast is clear. now's our chance to move in. move in. on what. treasure map. arrgh. where'd you get that. lizzie's room. you know you're not supposed to go in there without her permission. punish me while i'm living on my private island. let me see this. "you'll find this treasure buried at the end of the test. " matt, it's a school project. it's not a real treasure. so, you're out. i thought we were supposed to take you to minigolf today. and a movie. not when there's dinero to find. arrgh. who's got your treasure. who has got your treasure. who's got your treasure. yoho. who's got your treasure. yoho. yoho. well, we don't have to take matt to minigolf today. no. and lizzie's out of the house till 4:00. yep. we don't have to referee any fights. don't have to make any lunches. we're free. what shall we do. well we could clean out the rain gutters. yeah, or we could get a head start on our taxes. that's always fun. or we could have a pillow fight. jo. what's the matter. what. you afraid you might lose. no. what's the problem. i don't have a pillow. well, get one. you know, you can quit doing that. we're way ahead of everyone. no need to be all spygamey. what do you mean. i always enter a room like that. okay, let's, um keep the personal details on a needtoknow basis, okay. okay, but i really wanted to know how you got your ears so clean. oh, look, there's gordo. put that hand down. we're in a fight, remember. i hate fighting with my best friends. i thought we were in the lead. well, we would have been if we didn't have to stop and buy sweaters. two words, gordo. half off. what are we doing here again. ethan, we're here because the answer to the last clue was "the opposite of the boston tea party" means the opposite of "analog. " the opposite of "analog" is "digital" and the opposite of "tea" is "coffee. " that's why we're here at the digital bean. let's just get to noise candy. ah. cd store. right. yeah. tell me why again. ethan, the clue is kind of hard to miss. "the pilgrims landed here and found no records but got a sweet deal. " the pilgrims landed on plymouth rock, right. yeah, okay. so, rock music candy, sweet deal. noise candy. oh, right. yeah, i'm just trying to connect the dots here. no. no connecting the dots. that's what we're doing, blade runner. and we're ahead of you. no, because we're ahead of you. actually, no, we're ahead of both of you. which puts us in the lead and we're not cheating by wearing those. i can't believe my exbest friend just called me a cheater this is not cheating. page 11 in the test handout. if you were my partner, you would have known that. why would i want my exbest friend to be my partner. you wouldn't. unless, of course, she apologized but don't bother listening to me. nobody ever does. i'm sorry, gordo, are we speaking again. come on, we're going. we're already gone. well, so are we. come on, ethan. i haven't got my food yet. come on. excuse me. got to keep moving. was that mr. dig. nah. excuse me. oh. oh. hey, watch it. ow. my elbow. ow. get off my. fighting really hurts. but i'm going to win this race if it kills me. that was fun. yeah. so what should we do now. snack time. i got dibs on the whipped cream can. "he rode his horse to warn 'the british are coming' then he went to town for a dog. " paul revere. easy. revere's hot dogs on maple street. good. all this treasure hunting's making me kind of hungry. uh, thanks. anytime. you know i don't know who that kid is, but i like his style. then i says to the guy i says "you call that a hypotenuse. i'd like to see your idea of an isosceles triangle. " okay, so not to question my good fortune but why are you, lizzie and gordo fighting. because i'm right and they're wrong. and i am not apologizing this time. well, what happened. do you want to know what happened. i'll tell you what happened. not only did she not call gordo but she didn't meet me at the digital bean so i wound up looking like an idiot. why. because i am the dependable one. i was there when i said i was going to be, okay. she knew i was going to be there. so why should i apologize for being there when i said i'd be there.. i didn't even get the message. nobody even bothered to call me. so now lizzie's all mad at me because she thinks i ditched her and gordo's mad because he didn't get the invite. i mean, do they really think that i'm that kind of person who would ditch my friends. it's like they don't even know me. so why should i apologize when it's not even my fault. i don't care who's fault it is they should be calling me to apologize. know why. 'cause like always i'm their takeitforgranted friend. i'm never called first. i'm always an afterthought. and this time i am not apologizing for being mad because they ignored me. again. so what are you going to do. i don't know. but one thing's for sure i am not apologizing. look at me. i'm eating peanut butter with my fingers. yeah, well, look at me. i'm drinking milk out of the carton. not only that, watch this. i can make a shake in my mouth. no. oh, gosh. oh. sam. mmm, that is good. who's the kid now. who's the kid now.. i'll clean that up later. i'm so glad i married you. okay, if you ever repeat this, i will deny deny but you kind of actually have something i want. what. i may be the most popular girl in the universeactually i ambut i don't have friends like lizzie and miranda. friends. right. which is why neither one of them bothered to call me. gordo, friends like those are harder to find than jeans that fit right. so not talking to them about something like thisstupid. she's a salty, sweet kind of person like, um chocolatecovered pretzels. yeah, a missed phone call and chocolate covered pretzels. i can see why you're not talking. look, i may be the tall, dark, handsome mysterious stranger, lone wolf kind of guy but even i wouldn't mind having friends like lizzie and gordo. all right, lizzie, let me break it for you. i may have perfect hair and be down with the ladies but even i don't have good friends like gordo and miranda. well, apparently, neither do i. which is okay with me because i'm fine on my own. lizzie, lizzie, lizzie they're your peeps. do the right thing did ethan craft just say something smart. maybe he really is as perfect as i think. so, you're going to apologize. no. ah, let me commend you on getting this far. you've covered a lot of ground. i'll have the ben franklin with some relish, please. he's got a sense of humor, too. or does he really not see that that's mr. dig. hey, mr. d, when'd you get here. okay, people. in june 1775, the first major fight between british and american armies occurs here. replace the nk with an rg and you've found the next question. nk. rg bunker hill, burger hill. oh. oh. let's go, ethan. let's go. no way. you just stole our answer. come on, gordo, let's ogay. ogay. no, let's just go. go, go, go, go. larry.  i'm in the race, but i've already won and getting there can be half the fun so don't stop me till i'm good and done don't you try to rain on my perfect day it's the perfect day it's the perfect day nothing's gonna bring me down i could stay forever as i am on this perfect day nothing's standing in my way on this perfect day nothing can go wrong i'm in the race but i've already won and getting there can be half the fun don't you try to rain on my perfect day. no fair. no fair. you cheat. do not. do, too. do not which way's out. just follow me, honey. hey, i think i found the cheese dip. hey, don't i know you. i'm not sure. i'm wondering if i know you. you're the guy from the digital bean. and the hot dog stand, the cd storethe kite store. yep. so do i get my treasure. you won, of course you get the treasure. so what is it. well, in addition to spending a beautiful day outdoors and gaining valuable knowledge and satisfaction for a job well done you get an "a. " an "a". a bright, shiny "a. " what can i do with an "a". i don't even go to this school. i want a treasure. okay. see ya. lizzie, what are you doing. sorry, ethan, you were right. and now is my chance to do the right thing. you think you can move your chance across the finish line. come on, i never get an "a. " come on, we're right here. we could win. well, they're right there, too. and right now, my friends are the most important thing to me. so like a lady. i'm sorry. what did you say. i said i'm sorry. look i hate us not talking to each other, okay. i apologize. i'm sorry for whatever happened, you know. and it doesn't even matter whose fault it is. all that matters is that i hate us fighting and i want us to be friends again. you know what. i'm sorry. i feel like i let this get way out of hand. and i should've apologized a long time ago. so so i'm really sorry. well, i'm sorry, too. i really missed you guys. and can we please just agree in advance that if we ever get mad at each other we won't stop talking. deal. totally. so beautiful. it's just like a movie. this is exactly why i never do anything nice. i talk to him, give him advice and what does he do. stands on the loser side of the finish line to have his "little apology. " yeah, i'm going to have to agree with you on that one not that i needed an "a" but you know, i want an "a. " and you know why. 'cause an "a" doesn't stand on the loser side of the finish line and let you down. um, we can still win. all of us. together. yeah. all of us together. like it should be. so, mr. dig, do we get that "a". well, it would seem that way. but no. nina and jeremy got here first. better luck next time. so, no "a. " no "a. " well, that's okay because there's no "a" in friendship. ethan thought there was. i missed gordo's sense of humor although that's probably not a joke. hey, hey, hey, get your feet off the table. mom, why is there peanut butter on my video game. i have no idea. man, the giant pig ate me again. dumb pig. oink, oink, oink, i want to eat you. chomp. let me break it for you. okay, i just okay, then. maybe ethan's not the brightest crayon in the box but at least he's pretty. set. excuse me. sorry. and action. and action. giggles out. okay. rolling. action.
