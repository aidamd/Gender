to bid adieu to lizzie the lizard. she was a good lizard. yes, she was. right, she was a good lizard. matt, you wanted to say a few words. when i think of lizzie the things i remember most are the way she looked at me and smiled when i came home with her treat. . and the way her beady little eyes shined and the way her tail wagged. lizzie was more than just a class project to me. she was a friend. a good friend a good friend. i did it kate. i'm really sorry. you are so gonna pay for this. is that a threat. it could be. see you around. oh, i'll be around. lizzie, the service is over. matt, what do you say we rethink bringing home the hamsters next month. are you kidding. like i'm even showing my face in school after this. i can't show up without lizzie. matt, your classmates will understand. two weeks ago gina meyerhoff accidentally stepped on the class centipede she only sprained one of its legs. but gina after two days of torture she asked to be moved to another class. nobody's heard from her since. rumor has it she fled the country. you know, i swear that manual didn't say a thing about changing the water. whatever. murderer. knock, knock. please don't ask me what's wrong. please don't ask me what's wrong. please don't ask me what's wrong. what's wrong. come on. what tipped you off. well, you seemed so sad downstairs and i know you could care less about your brother or his lizard. and i know you could care less about your brother or his lizard. so spill. okay did you ever let someone take the blame for something that you did. yeah i backed my dad's car into a tree and i let my sister take the blame. ha. i knew it. mom's not perfect. she only pretends to be. so what happened. finally, i just broke down and told everybody the truth. did you get in trouble. yeah. but i felt a lot better. honey, i don't know the details here but if it's something that you think you can fix then you should, sweetie. because, who knows you might feel good enough to to start being mean to your brother again. oh, kate, there you are. mirandashe didn't start that rumor. i did but i'd back off if i were you. unless, of course, you want things to get ugly. so how was that. who cares. my lizard's dead. matt, pay attention. okay. kate. yeah. i just wanted to well. okay, i just wanted to tell you that i haven't got all day. right. i just wanted to tell you that, um your shoelaces are untied. freak. did you just call my friend a freak. she would have to be a freak to be your friend. i'm not the one with green hair. that's it. i've gone easy on u. that little stunt with danny kessler and the posters all over the schoolthose were nothing. i'm a cheerleaderi can turn the whole school against you. the whole school. no. just everyone who's going to the pep rally. poor matt. his confidence must be so shaken. i mean, lizzie the lizard alive one day dead and buried the next. huh. what. it says here, lizards hibernate they appear dead while they're actually sleeping. well, that's great. yeah. now matt can take her back to class and uhoh. trouble. matt. she's really sleeping. oh, sure. can't you hear her snoring. they sleep on their backs with their little feetup in the air like that. yeah. there's something in here about sleeping positions. okay. uh, honey, why don't you keep the box open 'cause she could probably use some air. yeah, just a thought, matt. you might want to turn her back over on her little feet before you bring her back to school. yeah sure. why is going to a pep rally required. like the school day isn't embarrassing enough without having to sing about it. i actually feel kind of sorry for her. really. no. okay, that's it. i can't take it anymore. i have to tell her. lizzie, don't. i can handle this. i can totally handle this. possibly. no, no. you know what. i can handle this. i started this whole thing and i'm finally going to take responsibility and i'm going to finish it. kate. we've got to talk. yeah. i um ii ticktock, ticktock. miranda didn't do it. i did. did what. um ii um hello. bored. um hey. you touched me. yeah. i wasn't finished talking to you. what has gotten into you. okay, listen. miranda didn't write that instant message. i did. i was jealous that you made cheerleader and i didn't. i'm sorry about what i wrote. it was rude. and i wish i could take it back. wow. i have to say, lizzie i didn't think you had it in you to stand up to me. good for you. i've been practicing. i guess that means you're not going to ruin miranda's life. no, of course not. that would be mean. never laid a glove on me. ok one, two, three huh. * ugly * * you ain't got no alibi * * you ugly, yeah, yeah, you ugly * * ugly * * you ain't got no alibi * * you ugly, yeah, yeah, you ugly * * ugly * * you ain't go no alibi * * you ugly,

you're right, miranda. standing up to kate was actually fun. but everyone's staring at you well at least they know who i am now. hey, loser. i mean, i feel like a huge weight's been lifted. well, i for one am glad it's over. yeah, and next time i'll try to step up a little quicker. did you guys hear. larry tudgemen picked his nose and had a snack and dannykessler caught it on tape. well, you're officially yesterday's news. the herd's moved on. so, you guys want to go see if we can find a copy of that tape. let's go. )
