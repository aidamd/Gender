emotion, people. what i'm talking about is emotion. say it with meemotion. emotion. try it this way. emotion. emotion. mr. dig is a great substitute, but he scares me sometimes. acting is about honesty. it's about movementacting and reacting. lizzie. okay, he scares me all the time. now, that's real emotion. how do you feel, miss mcguire. uh scared. good. is this for real. is he okay. does this mean class is over. mr. dig. are you okay. can you hear me. mr. dig. i don't think he's breathing. and that's the kind of emotion i want to see in your scenes today. mr. dig, that was so not funny. you're right. that wasn't comedy. but you know what is. malcolm in the middle. as a matter of fact i taught frank muniz everything he knows. sure you did, mr. dig. oh, you kids are so cynical today. it's a tragedy. it's like one of shakespeare's greatest plays romeo and juliet which you have just volunteered yourself to read. great. and who'll be my romeo today. how about mr. "is class over 'cause the teacher's dead". ethan, that means you. you know, for a dead guy, you're kind of mean. now, go to your proverbial corners and come out acting. does life get better than a love scene with ethan craft. "romeo, romeo, wherefore art thou, romeo." "romeo, romeo, wherefore art thou, romeo." romeo. "but soft what light through yonder window breaks." it is the east, and you are the sun. " this is officially my alltime favorite play. hey, frankie how'd you get out of the tv. if you believe we've got a pictureperfect plan we've got you fooled 'cause we only do the best we can and sometimes we make it and sometimes we fake it but we get one step closer each and every day we'll figure it out on the way. lizzie mcguire s02e15 lizzie in the middle you guys, there's this totally crazy rumor going on that frankie muniz is here and having lunch with lizzie. she makes it sound like it could never happen. aw, gee, thanks, frankie. cool. hey, i heard that, too. he was in drama class. he came to visit mr. dig. they read romeo and juliet. it was kind of movieoftheweekish. uh, but still, very cool. so, uh how was your, uh, summer. well, i finished shooting my series read a few movie scripts and bought a car. what about you guys. um, well, ii, um well, i started to, uh i broke my toe. gordo. what. i did. it was my big toe. i had to go to the hospital. it was very traumatic. what. at least something more than "uhum" happened to me. so, um, what are you doing here. yeah, it can't be because of gordo's exciting "big toe" story. i'm in town to shoot a tv movie, and i thought i'd swing by and see my old friend, mr. dig. hey, i've got to run back to my hotel to do an interview. but, uh maybe you and i can go out sometime. this is the part where the alarm clock always goes off. uh, lizzie frankie just asked you out. even i didn't see that one coming. that beats my "big toe" story by a mile. so, uh, lizzie, how about it. want to go out with me. i mean, i know i play a kind of dorky guy on tv but i'm not really like that. well i am sitting here, asking someone out i just met and you're just staring at me. so maybe i'm a bigger dork than i play on tv. i'm just going to go crawl under a rock now. really, i'm fine. nnno, justjust give her a sec. ii don't think she uh, heard the question. lizzie, uh, are you okay. uh iii'm fine. um i don't know. pick me. me, please, me. it must be good to be a tv star. frankie. frankie. frankie. but he's famous. that's exactly why i'm not going to date him. we're from two different worlds, just like romeo and juliet. and look how they ended up . i'm impressed. you really seem to make the right decision. whoa, whoa whoawhen did we come up with the nodatingfamouspeople rule. it's not his fault he's famous. how do we know he's not a normal kid like one of us. i mean, what do you really know about him anyway. she knows it wouldn't work. exactly. but she doesn't even really know anything about the guy. you should at least give him a chance. what guy. no guy. uh, mr. and mrs. mcguire let's just say lizzie was asked out by a famous actor. hypothetically speaking of course. yeah, but shouldn't she at least give him a chance and go out with him. absolutely no. absolutely yes. uhoh. i just found a disturbance in the force. we'll be going now. we will. yes. oh, right. we will, yeah. okay. bye. you are not dating some crazy hollywood type. dad, frankie muniz is not crazy.
