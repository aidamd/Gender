"we went to fix the football. we're really sorry. " it's signed matt and lanny. great. like i'm not in enough trouble as it is. my little brother and his friend are missing we killed my dad's prized possession and i have an english test tomorrow. things couldn't be better. whoa. remember how i said things couldn't get any worse. i was wrong. not helping, gordo. come on. that's it. i've called all of their friends. nobody has seen or heard from matt and lanny. the only thing that's worse than having matt and lanny around is not having matt or lanny around. i'm going to be in so much trouble. why don't we just go out and look for them. yeah. i mean, how far can two 11yearolds with a broken football go. hello. my parents are going to be home soon, you guys. we don't have time to find them and then get back. oh. matt. lizzie. mom. is everything okay. um it really depends on your definition of "okay. " yeah, everything is, um, everything's fine. is matt behaving. yeah. matt and lanny are great. ththey're playing quietly upstairs. come here. what. she said matt's behaving. i think something's wrong. well, here's the deal. your dad and i are going to be a little late 'cause we got a flat. oh, that's great. ii mean, um, that's greatly bad. so, we'll be home in a couple of hours. oh, okay, well, um, you guys just take your time. you don't get out enough as it is. i've got everything totally under control. we'll see you guys soon. okay. yes. okay, we just bought some time. i know i would feel better if we had somebody check in on those kids. hey, i could have my softball buddies swing by on their way home from practice. well, it's better than nothing. here's the plan, guys. okay, you're going to stay home and man the phone. oh, come on. ii never get to do any of the cool stuff. i want to go with you guys. gordo, matt and lanny like you. if they call, you can convince them to come back home. fine, but can i order a pizza. gordo, matt and lanny are missing. lizzie's about to be grounded for life and all you can think about is food. i'm hungry. fine, gordo, order a pizza for yourself, okay. miranda, you're coming with me. cool. everybody clear on the plan. yeah. this plan better work. i think my parents might notice that matt's missing after a couple of days. well, mom will notice. go, go. this is a walter payton autographed football. you boys are in a lot of trouble. sorry, son. i think he's passed. you mean, there's nothing we can do. only a miracle can help you now. of course, um you could just replace it. that's brilliant. you read my mind, lanny. we're off to the collector's corner. shalom. once again, gordothe responsible onegets left behind. lizzie and miranda get to go out and track down matt and lanny while i'm here by myself. all alone. with cable. and video games. and a refrigerator full of food. for a smart guy, i can be kind of dumb sometimes. i think i will order a pizza. this is so typical of matt. i mean, i set rules and he breaks them. he doesn't think of the consequences of his actions. ruined dad's football, ruined our lives. not exactly hard to remember. sounding a little parental, aren't we. miranda, you didn't lose your little brother. what is this weird feeling i'm having. i'm worried. lanny and matt are out there all alone and it's my fault. it's not all your fault. i don't know what i'm going to do if we can't find them. we'll find them. well, where do you think they'd go. okay, i'm an 11yearold geek with a popped football signed by some famous guy. oh, oh. collector's corner, the comic book store. they sell footballs there. they sell everything there. it's like the geek version of the mall. come on. mmm, pizza. hey, so you guys deliver pizza, too, huh. mmm, pizza. nah. sam called us. we're just here to check up on you guys. oh, well, uh, we're all doing great. everything's aokay. so, see you later. how dumb do you think we are. do you really want me to answer that. we need visual confirmation that everyone's aokay. everyone's upstairs. they'll be down in a second. yeah, yeah. go on. make yourselves at home. come on. walter payton, walter payton walter payton. can i help you. what is this. it's an autographed walter payton football. oh, yeah, yeah, perhaps in a former life. now it's more like an autographed walter payton pancake. me and lannythis is lannyyou see it's kind of our fault that this football is ruined. it's my dad's and it's really, really important to him. if i don't get him a new ball then i'm in big trouble, and lanny's in big trouble and my sisterwho really didn't do anything is going to be in big trouble. it sounds like a really touching story here. so, we were hoping maybe that you would exchange this ball for that nice new one. hmm. let me think about that. no. matt. matt. i thought you said they'd be right down. yeah, um hey. say, you guys like jokes. i got a great one. okay, so, king of norway, he he goes out into the woods with his, uh, his, uh, number one hunter, right. how'd you guys find us. well, we just pretended we were a couple of geeks and where would we be. sorry. matt, what were you thinking taking off like that. and you better have a good answer. well, we just thought: what would you do in this situation. well, you wouldn't get into trouble in the first place, but you'd try to fix it. oh, that's a pretty good answer. and that's what we tried to do. but you really scared me. i did. yeah, you did, and right now the football doesn't even matter. all that matters is that you two are okay, and we get you guys home safe. you know, i really hate to interrupt this little hallmark moment but we do have some parents to beat home. that's it. we're done for. it's not over. nothing is over until i decide it is. uh, no. give me the football. what are you doing. i'm saving the day. excuse me. uh, mr. comic book guy. you're wasting your time. i already told the little hobbit no. uh, excuse me, sir. i have here an autographed walter payton football. yeah, yeah, in lessthanmint condition. i realize that, but i was just wondering if maybe you would do a tradeyou know, give me another football. interesting. tell you whati'll give you a dick butkus for a deflated walter payton. deal. what's a dick butkus. i don't know, but he's all we got right now. come on. it's mine. the king of norway says "i thought he said he, uh "i thought he said he was a moose. " that was terrible. um yeah, um, i guess it was. uh, maybe that's 'cause i told it wrong. uh, let me start again. hhow does it go. uh all right. okay. so, uh, so the king of norway he goes out into the woods with his number one hunter and what's going on up there. nothing. let's go check it out. what's going on up here. oh, uh, um nnnothing. somebody's missing. where's lizzie. hmm mom and dad. hello, anyone home. ah come on, let's go. they're overthey're over there. help me. help me. okay. hey, guys. everything okay. fine. great. where's lizzie. we can't find her. what do you mean, you can't find her. yeah. i'm sure you had something to do with this. you're coming with me. uh, uh lanny. hey, guys. um how was the sports thingie. and the high point of the day was when i got my picture taken with last year's superbowl mascot. sam. sam. sam. so, did you kids do anything fun today. um let's see: destroying a football chasing matt and lanny across town and sneaking back into the house without getting caught. yeah. it was fun. no, we didn't have any fun. yeah, just another boring day. who would care to explain this to me. so close, yet still so busted. explain what. how my walter payton signed football has magically become a dick butkus signed football. it's all my fault. no, it's all my fault. it's our fault. we ruined your football, dad. is this authentic. well, the guy at the store said it was. and you traded in dad's ruined football for this. we're really sorry. you guys are really good. mom's taking this really well. what are you talking about. they ruined my beloved payton and brought back a butkus. if i were you guys, i would have just bought another football and signed itthat's what i did. you did what. uh, well, thethe football that lizzie and matt ruined was actually a walter payton football autographed by jo mcguire. the real one fell into the fireplace a couple of months ago accidentally. it did. yeah. so technically, we didn't ruin dad's football. and we got him a football signed by someone more famous than mom. so, technically, we can't be grounded, right. wrong. not fair. that should be a penalty on mom: unnecessary grounding. okay, from now on, this football is offlimits to everyone in this house except me. you know, i really am sorry for messing up your day. i didn't mean to. well, yes, i did, but just not that much. i know. and i'm sorry for coming down on you so hard. i didn't mean to. yeah, you did, but, uh, you're my sister and that's your job. i know. and i take my job very seriously. so, um, you do know that if you ever need something i'm here for you, right. yeah. okay. okay. oh, but if you ever run away like that again i'm going to totally crush you. i know. whoa, what you gonna do. come and get it. what's my motivation. or i'll beat you up. set, hike. set, 42. lanny, i knew you shouldn't have had those beans. matt, you give me that football right now or else you're taboo. let's see destroying a football. dick butkus for a deflated walter hill. uh, walter payton. walter hill's an interesting director, though. that's a cut. is that good enough, steve. that's good. )
