hey, honey, how was school today. oh, school was wonderful. did you guys have a good day. it was okay. yeah, it was just fine. oh, look, you're making your famous stroganoff. oh, it's my favorite. mmm. are you in trouble, or do you want something. i knew the stroganoff was going too far. last time, i tried to feed it to the dog. and we don't even have a dog. well, you know, mom, dad i'm ii'm 14 now, and i have a lot more needs. and i don't want to bug you guys every single time that i need to buy something so, um uum i want a raise on my allowance. how can you argue with that. no. no. i guess that's how. but all of my friends got raises. give them the sad eyes. they can't say no to the sad eyes. oh, enough with the sad eyes. listen, if there's something you really need, just ask us and we'll get it for you. you know, that's just it, dad. i don't want to have to ask anymore. i'm not a little kid. i need freedom. well, when you earn money of your own you can be free with that but until then, you have to manage with your allowance the way that it is. fine. yeah, well, your stroganoff tastes like an old shoe. an old, smelly, burnt shoe. if you believe we've got a pictureperfect plan we've got you fooled 'cause we only do the best we can and sometimes we make it and sometimes we fake it but we get one step closer each and every day we'll figure it out on the way. lizzie mcguire s02e05 working girl and they just said "no" about raising my allowance. just like that, like, "no. " well, did they say why. i think it's because they want complete and total control over my life forever. not forever. just until you turn 18. you've got four years to go. four more years. don't i get time off for good behavior. i just hate running to them for every little thing. lizzie, you could get a job. when i'm at the mall, and i want a pair of jeans i want to buy them. lizzie, you could get a job. i need independence and freedom. but, no, they'll never let me have that. lizzie, you could get a job. a job. what a great idea. i could get a job. oh, i'm sorry. were you saying something, miranda. huh. oh, no, i think getting a job's a great idea. uh, i think they're looking for a new busboy. oh. i can clear do plates. i do that at home for free. oh, i can be the new busboy. ooh, hhow do i look. you look like a busboy. okay. go get 'em. looks like there's a new busboy in town. mcguire's batting a thousand on the job front. so, when do you start. i start tomorrow. but i thought we were all supposed to hang at the mall tomorrow. oh, well, we can hang here instead. it'll be fun. are you sure. we don't want to get you in trouble. oh, no, i think it'll be fine. plus, i think i can swing for some free drinks for my friends. free. free is my favorite number. matt, something up with you. you didn't even notice i threw the ball. oh. now i know something's wrong. even lanny said you've been awful quiet lately. it's just, reggie i don't think melina wants to be friends with me anymore. i thought things were good. she hasn't gotten you in trouble for days. exactly, and jared ferguson has been in detention for nearly a week now. it doesn't take a genius to put two and two together. melina has moved on. you're better off without her, man. it's just i don't understand girls. nobody understands girls.
