i hope they show the one where the zombies wake up, take over the radio station and play bad disco music. or the one where those newlyweds realize that their honeymoon is actually a horrormoon. this scary movie marathon rocks. gordo doesn't know what he's missing. yeah, he must like his dad a lot 'cause he didn't seem too bummed to have to spend some time bonding with him. last time me and my dad "bonded" i got stung by a bee. oh, yeah. well, the last time my dad and i bonded i almost broke my toe. dad. yup, i think it's much safer stayin' at home and getting scared out of our brains. correct me if i'm wrong but are gordo's dad and brooke baker the same person. huh. he and his dad must have rescheduled. he obviously came here looking for us. he doesn't look like he's looking for us. he looks like he's on a i can't even say it. say what. look at them. private table, away from the crowd,sitting close gordo even looks like he brushed his hair. so. so.. oh, please. you don't think they're on a date, do you. no way. it's gordo, remember. we're his best friends. he would have mentioned it. come on. let's go get him. or maybe we should go. gordo just kissed someone. i'm not sure, but i think i just lost my appetite. gordo's got a girlfriend. and i thought the movie marathon was going to be scary. if you believe we've got a pictureperfect plan we've got you fooled 'cause we only do the best we can and sometimes we make it and sometimes we fake it but we get one step closer each and every day we'll figure it out on the way. lizzie mcguire s01e19 gordo and the girl it's awfully quiet. i know, one of them must have done something. i'll take matt. lizzie's yours. deal. okay. here's your lunch, sweetie. thanks, mom. i cut off the crusts like you like. great. and i put an extra snack in there, too. great. okay, what happened. well, gordo lied to me, went on a date then kissed a girl without mentioning any of it to me. nothing. really. nothing. mm everything's okay at school with your friends. yeah. fine. watch the pro. hiya, matt. hiya, dad. what's going on. nothing. how about with you. well, i think i have a science test today but i'm not entirely sure. i kicked our social studies globe last week by accident and now i have to work in the cafeteria to help pay for a new one. and i totally don't know what's going on in math. you got a lot on your plate, son. yep. how about i help you with your homework after school. cool. cool. so, how was the scary movie marathon. mm scary. oh. my dad and i got home too late to watch it. really. what'd you end up doing instead. uh, we went to a book signing. the guy who wrote it spent six months walking across the himalayas. he started out with nothing but a pair of shoes and a candy bar. if i didn't know any better, i'd believe him. that's so gordo. he'd get in "a" in lying. sounds interesting. who's it from. um, lizzie, you seem to have everything under control. uh, ii'll be right back. gordo, you cannot just leave me with this dead octopus. look all you have to do is keep slicing. don't worry. if you make a mistake, there's seven more legs. gordo, gordo, you've my lab partner. you cannot just leave me. hello. hi, there. hey, i'm your best friend, remember. over here. ah, crud. it's useless. ooh. gordo walked away from a science project. after he got a note. gordo got a note.. he still hasn't mentioned his date the other night. gordo had a date.. calm down, miranda. you were there. uh, sorry. this whole thing is rocking my world. i mean, gordo and brooke are definitely an item. people are talking. about gordo. i feel like i'm in a dream where everyone wants to kiss my frog. see, here's the part that gets me all confucius: not that gordo has a girlfriend but that gordo is somebody's boyfriend. ooh. i know. very hard to imagine. i guess if you live long enough anything can happen. hey, guys, i just wanted to tell you that i'm not going to be eating lunch with you today. hmm interesting. yeah, it's just that i promised a friend that i'd help out with some homework. a friend, huh. yeah, so i'll see you guys later. does he honestly think we don't know.. we saw them kissing. maybe they were just talking really close. that wasn't talking. maybe she had a smudge on her mouth or something. that he was trying to get off with his lips.. listen, miranda i'm just looking out for him, okay. gordo is "h&h" with brooke. if there's any possibility that gordo's going to get hurt we've got to stop it. okay, matt. each row has got ten gumballs in it. that represents a hundred percent. now, if we take away four gumballsthe four white oneswhat percentage of gumballs are missing. right. good job. i knew that using gumballs as a visual aid would help. don't eat your homework and help me take out the trash. um, i don't think so. excuse me. dad, i bet there's a 100% chance that you're going to ask me to take out the garbage again. so. so, if i'm right, i'm not doing it. and if i'm wrong, i will. matt, i'm going to ask you one more time help me take out the garbage. man, this percentage stuff is easy. i'll be in my room. thanks again, dad. next, you'll be meeting someone and keeping it behind my back. i won't even know until i see you with him kissing. and soon you'll be ditching me for him at every single turn. i'll be alone all alone. oh. not going to happen. it might, one day. are you kidding.. you'll know all the deets. i guess it's too late to have this conversation with gordo. now he's with someone who's completely wrong for him. maybe brooke really likes gordo. i mean, sure, he's a little different but that's why i like him. you like gordo. no. i don't like him like him. you know what i mean. wait, do you like gordo. no. at least i don't think so. no. of course i don't like gordo. gross. just asking. hey, i'm glad you guys are here. i wanted to tell you something. we wanted to tell you something, too. and there's no easy way to say this, but, uh we know about you and brooke. oh, that's exactly what i wanted to tell you guys as well. we kind of saw you two together and don't take this the wrong way but, um you ever thought that maybe she's using you. is there a "right way" to take that. you bailed on me in science then at lunch to help her with her homework aand i know i saw you two kissing i'm still trying to cleanse the memory. you guys saw us here the other night. we're best friends. i can't believe you haven't mentioned her. not once. well, i'm sorry if i wanted to keep something in my life private. we're just trying to help you, gordo. we're protecting you. we don't want you to get hurt. by telling me she's using me.. why, 'cause a girl like brooke could never like a guy like me. well, guess what, she does. it's just that it's brooke baker. i mean, she's friends with claire. that's all we're saying. she's also friends with me. in fact, we're more than friends. funny, i came here to tell you guys how happy i am, thinking you'd be glad for me. i guess that's just too much to expect from my best friends. see you around. gordo, wait. why do i have the feeling that gordo just broke up with us. 'cause he did. okay, lanny, this is how it's going to work. every time i guess right i'll take one percent of all the candy here. and every time i guess wrong i'll take one percent of all the candy here. oh, here she comes. okay i'll bet you all the candy here that lizzie starts yelling at me. ow. matt, i thought i told you that between the hours of 12:00 noon and 12:00 noon you're supposed to ignore me. but you never said i couldn't throw things at you. oh. hey, that's a great idea, lanny. we'll play odds and percentages at school. but with other people's candy. sweet. this is the longest i've ever gone without talking to gordo since he deliberately smooshed my brownie in the third grade. how long did your fight last then. till the bus ride home. well, maybe this is what happens when your best friend's a boy. things get complicated. i guess i just miss him. you can try talking to him. i hear he waits for brooke at her locker between classes. gordo waits at her locker.. he's in a relationship now. it's sort of required. tomorrow night. cooly. but first i have to help brooke get ready for her hot date. it's at the holy rigatoni. isn't that romantic. a hot date.. gordo's her boyfriend. wrap your mind around it. hot date and gordo are never used in the same sentence. especially by claire. brooke's date is obviously with someone else. so gordo, i'm really sorry about what i said. and i've decided to be totally supportive of you and brooke. you have. yes, because it seems you really like each other. and i'm sure when you two are together, it's very cool. only not cool. more on the warmish side. even warmer than warm. what's warmer than warm. what are you guys talking about. david, hurry. we're going to be late for science. hmm. i got to go. there. are you happy now. no, miranda, i'm not. gordo had no clue about this hot date. well, i wouldn't either with the way that conversation was going. i was right. brooke is twotiming gordo. this is going to totally destroy him. lizzie, unless you actually go to the holy rigatoni spy on brooke and get pictures of her date then you have nothing. that's it. we'll spy. we'll do it for gordo. ooh, brilliant idea, miranda. neat. uh, that's not what i meant. and we are not spying. yes, we are. come on. come on, miranda. why am i the one dressed like a boy. because your voice is deeper. besides, you know, this was your idea. no, it wasn't. and i'm having a really big problem, lizzie. i have to go to the bathroom. so go. yeah. which one. ooh. i see your problem. oh, there's brooke. there's brooke, go. i can't tell who she's with. wait, he's getting up. who. her date. he's going to the men's room. go follow him. in there.. you said you had to go. so go. i can't go in there. they have those weird fountain thingies on the wall. just go. all i'm saying is there's a one out of five chance mr. bradwell's going to be wearing his beers of the world tie on monday. uhhuh. you're either in on the action or you're not. i'm in. i'm in. put joel down for two printed packs on broadwell. hmm, another call. hello. what's on tomorrow. yeah, dodge ball game's tomorrow at 2:00. odds are two to one that blue's going to crush yellow. i'll take yellow. throw your knee pads in with the helmet. and you got yourself a deal set my helmet on yellow. put binder down on yellow. hmm. another call. how are we doing, lanny. other people's candy. yo, talk to me. we've got to get out of here. why. come on, come on, come on, let's go. oh. hey. oh. thanks for waiting. your table's ready. oh. we're not staying. thanks. sure you are. first dates make me nervous, too. cute couple. what do we do. oh. here. thanks, guys. right this way. everything bellissimo. enjoying your meal. okay, good. while you wait for your server, may i suggest an appetizer. i'd recommend our ooey gooey extra chewy mozzarella marina madness, or our large and in charge artichoke barge with perfect parmesan puffs. uh yes. fine, yeah. we could have made a run for it, miranda. no, we couldn't. gordo is right there. he would have seen us. what are we going to do. what are we going to do. we're going to sit here and wait for the food that we ordered. we do have to pay for it, you know. i really like this restaurant. yeah, me too. um, you got a little i also really like being here with you. i wish we'd spend more time together. oh, we're together now. uh, there's a more time together would be awesome. cheese well, ii mean we're together in between classes. we're together during classes. we're generally together after school. unless i transferred into all of your classes i could you. i mean it's not too late in the semester. fine. i was wrong. gordo is her hot date. thank you. now we can go. this should cover for the food. come on. they're talking. they won't see us leave. wait. whose idea was it to come here really. fine. mine. whatever. come on. let's go. ooh, sorry. hey, isn't that lizzie. her date looks a lot like miranda. that's because it is miranda. oh. we're really sorry. um my friend's not feeling very well and i've got this thing i've got to go to. if i just keep talking, no one will notice that i've ruined gordo's date and that i'm wearing everybody's dinner. boy, this place is crowded. you guys sell a lot of those artichoke barges here, huh. are you done yet. no. they can't be done. they have the rest of my life to destroy. this is just one night of it. come on, brooke. gordo's right. i've done permanent damage here. as permanent as this spaghetti is stuck in my hair. ow. well. oh, way too much garlic. guess we'll take this stuff to go. ha, ha. "fourpoint spread on secondperiod soccer game. " "kids who owe me stuff. " "scotty: pack of gum. " "kim: clean my scooter. " let's put this stuff over here, lanny. oh. hi, mom. hey, matt. i found your book. so, i did leave it at home. i mean, um that's not mine. care to explain this to me. um not really. have you boys been gambling. i love you, mommy. oh, my matt, matt. talk to me. i am waiting. well, you see it all started with this percentage stuff we were learning in school. i wasn't really getting it so dad explained it in a way that matt. don't blame this on your father. i mean, i know he can be a little no. never mind. go on. go on. so then i helped explain it to everyone else and the next thing you know, people were so thankful for my help, they started giving me all this stuff. well,that's a very nice story, honey but i'm not buying it but, mom, i'm providing a service to the people. a service. honey you're lying, cheating and gambling. okay, so maybe i did lie. and sureyou can throw in gambling. but, i matt mcguire, am not a cheater. well, good. then you'll be very fair when you return all these gifts everybody gave you. if you say so. oh, i say so. honey, this is a zerospread situation. and you are 100% busted. i think you understand me. return the puppy. sorry. don't go there. if i never see another meatball again i'll be happy. do you know how long it took me to wash the smell of garlic off of my hair. i guess it's just the two of us now. no more gordo. no more gordo. no more long lectures about how we care too much about what other people think about us. no more useless information about stuff we never even cared about in the first place. no more packs of cupcakes to share. no more cupcakes wait. why not. because they come in pack of threes. there's only two of us now i guess we could split the third one. no. it still wouldn't be the same. hey. hi. what are you doing here. not that we don't want you here. i guess i just didn't say everything to you that i wanted to last night. oh. honestly, i can't believe you guys would go so far as to spy on me and brooke. that's just really, really low. especially for you. it was miranda's idea. lizzie. and i also can't believe that you guys spied on me. you just said that, gordo. i know. on the one hand, i'm really insulted. but on the other i realize that you guys did it because you care a lot about me yeah. that's the one. well, for your information, brooke and i broke up. what.. is it because of what we did last night. gordo, i'm really sorry. andand you've got to get her back. if she won't listen to you, i'll try talking to her. wait, wait. i broke up with her. in a lot of ways, brooke's really great. she's smart. told you. she smells good, she's easy to be around. so, what's the problem. it's kind of conceptual. but i guess i just like the idea of having a girlfriend a lot better than actually having one. yup. he's back. look the kissing was cool and getting notes was kind of fun. i'm just not ready for that kind of commitment. i had to wait for her by her locker. i had to pay for her lunches. i had no time for myself anymore. bummer. i also had no time for you guys. i really miss that part. so did we. i knew he'd come back. they always do. so, uh, interesting wardrobe choice last night, miranda. oh, ii'm sorry. ii should say "mirando. " ugh. i said it once, and i'll say it again. it wasn't my idea. so gordo one thing that you haven't told us. what. how was the lip lock. i'm sorry. i don't kiss and tell. ugh. come on, spill. i'm not going to do it. dish, dude. i get confused with the two. settle down and hilary, remember, nonchalant. did you eat that. whoa. i'm getting a hole in my thing. don't you have two gloves. what if it leaks through. i don't think i want to eat lunch. his little eyes are looking at me. hilary hi, hilary. kiss me. don't worry. there are seven more legs. gordo, you cannot just leave me with a dead octopus. well, gordo lied to me, went on a date. whoa. makeup. wardrobe. mommy. )
