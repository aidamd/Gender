" i hate to break it to you, but, tudgeman, you're a geek. i'm a geek.. no, i'm not. my mom says the other kids are mean to me because they're jealous, okay.. great. i couldn't write anything better. let's move on. gordo, i think you were a little harsh on tudgeman. i would even go mean. i was just giving stan conflict. conflict. i think conflict is when my nail polish doesn't match my outfit. so, tell me about your friends. uh, my friends. yeah, how long have you known each other. well, we've known each other for a very long time. forever. yeah, forever. best friends. yeah, we tell each other anything. oh, and we keep each other's secrets. secrets. what secrets. oh, nothing. you guys are keeping stuff from me. like what. oh, like when lizzie was in the fourth grade she had a crush on you. you did. she did. what else. nothing. nothing else. i cannot believe you just said that. i'm sorry. it was a mistake. gordo tricked me. i didn't trick you. lizzie, is there something you'd like to share about miranda. share. friends always share. yeah, actually there is. in the fourth grade she used to come home and snack on doggie biscuits. oh, sorry, it was a mistake. i thought you were my friend. i thought you were mine. yeah, but i didn't do it on purpose. it was a mistake, unlike you. yeah, my only mistake was telling you anything. that was great. you have quite a future ahead of you, kid. you guys hear. stan thinks i have quite a future ahead of me. dirk. what. cut. no can do. one way or another i'm gonna find ya i'm gonna get ya, get ya, get ya, get ya one way or another i'm gonna meet ya i'm gonna get ya, get ya, get ya, get ya one way or another i'm gonna see ya i'm gonna meet ya, meet ya, meet ya, meet ya one day, maybe next week i'm gonna meet ya i'm gonna meet ya, i'll meet ya i will drive past your house and if the lights are all down i'll see who's around matt, that wasn't very nice. i didn't even see that coming. then you'd better hurry. melina, i've never met a girl like youa girl who loves trouble almost as much as i do. almost. is he gone. let me check. yeah, he's gone. come on out. see you after school. it's a date. hey, how was school. fine. so watcha doing. studying. so where are gordo and miranda. i don't know. so are you going to come right out and tell me what's wrong or do i have to ask you. mom watches a lot of cop shows. she always gets me to fess up. i thought this whole documentary thing would be cool, but it's not and now miranda and i are in a fight because we told each other's secrets to the camera. that doesn't sound like you guys. i know, but the thing is gordo was the one who started it. that certainly doesn't sound like gordo. he's completely changed. it's kind of hard to understand. he's being kind of mean and he's the one who encouraged us to tell the secrets. oh, honey, the camera does strange things to people. i know it probably doesn't make you feel any better, but the documentary crew is going to be gone in a week and your friends are still going to be there. ooh, i hate it when she tells me what i already know. so how should i handle it. i think you should talk to them. offcamera. so what was the secret. oh. that i, um i had a crush on gordo in the fourth grade. i knew it. i mean, you did. really. hey. can i talk to you. me first. look, i'm sorry. no, i'm sorry. who's that. popular kid. go get him, tiger. so, ethan, is there anything more to you than good hair. what. gordonwhy you got to be like that. i'm out. later, ladies. gordo. what were you doing. oh, come on, that was no big deal. it was so a big deal. you were really rude to him. that's not you. listen, guys, you know i want to be a director. i don't want to blow my big opportunity. stan really thinks i have a knack for this. a knack for whathurting people's feelings. yeah, i can't believe you're willing to be mean to everyone just to get what you want. that's not what i'm doing. i'm just being myself. yeah, right. some alternateuniverse whackedout alien version of yourself. the one great thing about you is you know who you are, and you are your own person. but now you're letting this director guy tell you who you are. um can we shut off the cameras for a second. no can do. so, if you're willing to put this film ahead of us, fine. i'm sure you'll make a great director some day. guys. come on. it just keeps getting better. i've been thinking about what you guys said. gordo, we already told you. we're not going to talk to you oncamera. sorry. think that was kind of mean. i think it was kind of necessary. that doesn't make me feel any better. "go away" i love this kid. i shouldn't be here. i'm grounded. do you always listen to your parents. when they're angry, yeah. we'll only stay for a second. how many chances will we get to be in a movie. besides, we're covered, there's tons of adults here. okay, but promise to lay low. i promise. come on. this whole documentary is a joke. let's see where this is going. i know this may end up on the cuttingroom floor but it needs to be said. this really isn't what middle school is like. this isn't real. i was encouraged by the director to act the way i did. it's not who i am and that's not how i treat my friends. so if that's what it takes to make it in this business then maybe i'm not cut out for it after all. that's it. i'm done. cut. cut. what are you doing, kid. i can't use any of that. i know. so go find yourself another zookeeper. now, that's the gordo i remember. welcome back. it's good to be back. hey, whoa, kid. wait up. matt, would you go and get me some ketchup. okay. here's your ketchup. oh, i don't need ketchup. what the.. you promised. i lied. you're amazing. you. kid. come here. hiya. ha. got you now, kid. fire. matt, catch. aren't you glad things are back to normal. okay, you guys already know what i'm going to say so do i even need to say it. yeah. okay. you were right. i'm sorry. i let the documentary become more important than our friendship. uh, where are the cameras when you need them. i would love to have that on film. i'm sure you'll all be pleased to know that there will be no documentary thanks to mr. ketchup and youyou just blew a onceinalifetime opportunity, pal. we will not be back. let's boot it. what a shame. i guess we'll all just have to hang out and be happy. all right. it's safe to come out. are you sure. positive. nice work back there, matt. am i in trouble. not with mei think you did a great jobbut with mom and dad you're toast. so, was that your girlfriend. she keeps on tricking me and getting me into trouble. i hope she's my girlfriend. so, you really had a crush on me in the fourth grade. i was young. i didn't know any better. okay, here we go, kids and background action. matt, catch. pour it on. oh, my gosh. i didn't know he did this to you. )
