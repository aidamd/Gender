'cause we only do the best we can. and sometimes we make it. and sometimes we fake it. but we get one step closer each and every day. we'll figure it out on the way. lizzie mcguire s01e08 misadventures of babysitting i think the perfect town would be 500 hot topic stores and a tenstory shopping mall. "design a model community, including housing hospitals, schools, and police and fire department. " "police and fire department. " "housing, hospitals and schools. " we'll call it boringville, u. s. a. where do they come up with these moronic assignments. the moronic assignment, study guide. it's, like, this thick. let me guess. that's how tall tom cruise is. oh, tom cruise isn't short. he just has small bones. okay, gordoimagine you live in a boring suburb where all the houses look alike and everybody's predictable. i do live in a boring suburb where all the houses look alike and everyone is predictable. thank you. okay, but if you could pick any business you wanted on main street, what would it be. a bookstore containing the works of navajo and greek philosophers a coffeehouse where people only discussed music and politics a thousandfoot water slide ending in a swimup counter where they serve free deepfried pizza and tyra banks would be the mayor. i've given this a lot of thought. hey, gordo, do you know where the nearest software shack is. yeah. it's over on collins street. would they have that software that designs cities and towns and stuff. you mean cybertown maker. they should. okay. kate, we're supposed to do this assignment ourselves. whatever. you're supposed to use your imagination not have some computer do it for you. gordo, why didn't you tell me there was a program like that. well, it cost 60 bucks. i don't think you can afford it. hello. i babysat twice last week. but my nails are wet. kate babysits. since when does kate babysit. oh, why don't they just make her queen of the world and be done with it. babysitting sounds like a pretty sweet gig. why don't you do it. i don't babysit. i get babysat. and plus, babysitting jobs are hard to get. parents want to make sure you're "mature enough. " well, i guess kate sort of does give off some visual signals, which imply a biologically nurturing capability. we get it, gordo. she's stacked. yes yes, she is. i don't get it. i mean, i'm just the same age as kate. i'm just as mature as she is. i'm responsible. and i want to babysit. absolutely not. but kate sanders babysits. she does. no. uh, ii mean, she she does, huh. yes. and you haven't found a sitter for tonight. and you expect me to ride a bus to school all by myself. why can't you trust me to babysit. hmm i think i'm getting a nibble here. maybe she has a point. and miranda can help me. she watches her baby sister after school. sweetheart, you're just not ready yet. this is a big responsibility. you've always told me i can do anything if i set my mind to it, honey. and i've set my mind to this. i can do it. we do say that, sam. ooh, i'm really getting a nibble here. but matt can be quite a handful. matt. what would you do if lizzie babysat you. i don't know. watch tv, i guess. thank you for the help, pal. all right, maybe we can give this a try. thanks, dad. it means a lot to me that you can trust me. i'll do a great job. okay, the coco rocks box will be city hall. i just ate the mayor. it'll go right there. lizzie, i added some numbers to the emergency phone list. also, i've moved all the cleaners out from under the kitchen sink. and whatever you do do not open the door for anybody. and i won't follow the trail of bread crumbs to the gingerbread witches' house. dad, don't worry. hey, gordo. hi, mrs. mcguire. my parents said i could come over if that's okay with you. oh, sure. but lizzie and miranda are babysitting matt so i don't know how much fun you're going to have. oh, i know. i'm not about fun. i'm about the green. lizzie. money. i'm going to earn my money indoor sitting on a sofa eating someone else's popcorn. hey, that's mine. lizzie, matt's bedtime is 9 o'clock. yes, dad, i know. dad, listen, everything's under control. i've got it all handled, okay. okay, now, both our cell phones are charged and we're trusting you, lizzie. whoa, can i hear that again. both our cell phones are charged. no, no, no. the other part. we're trusting you. yeah, that. tadah. after 13 yearstrust. thanks, dad. wow, for the first time in my life, i'm in charge. i'm the ranking adult in the house. i'm queen of the world. alone at last. i don't see why you have to muscle in on babysitting, gordo. this is how we make money. why should girls have a monopoly on babysitting. because boys have a monopoly on burping the pledge of allegiance. we deserve some kind of monopoly. hey, i love that game. i want to be the race car. tough luck. you're going to watch willy wonka. i've seen that ten times. i want to be the race car. well, we've got homework. if you'll be patient we'll maybe play later, okay. all right. race car, race car, race car, race car. anyone got any ideas. sorry. i got nothing. race car. race car. there you go, mr. and mrs. mcguire. your regular table. thank you, mrs. shin. haven't seen you since the year of the tiger. yeah, well, it's really hard to get a reliable babysitter. well, glad to have you back. i'll be back with some wontons. thank you. sam, would you please relax. it's one night out. lizzie can handle it. i mean it. everything's going to be fine. this had better come out of the carpet, matt. what'd you give him grape juice for. i told you ginger ale. at least ginger ale isn't purple. grape juice was the only thing that would shut him up. he won't do a thing you say. matt go upstairs change your shirt and get cleaned up now. no. see. zip it. why should i. he won't. matt, starting right now you do everything i tell you or i'll tell mom and dad. nuhuh. you want mom and dad to think you're a good babysitter so you're going to say things went great. then i'll squash you like a bug instead. then i'll tell mom and dad. face it. i'm in charge here. no. i am in charge here. matt, what do you say we go upstairs and find you a clean shirt. okay. how come he does what you say well, i'm an older male. he's impressed by me. well, i'm in charge here and he's supposed to do what i say, not what you say. who cares who says to do it. he needs a new shirt. he's as sticky as the floor of a movie theater. matt, don't lean there. i'm stuck. get up matt. gosh, it is so nice being out just the two of us, for a change. yep. nice. sam. hmm. you're turning your chopsticks into toothpicks. want to settle down. you're fidgeting. no, i'm not. okay, look, i just think it was a mistake leaving lizzie in charge. she's only 13. yeah, well, she's 13, but, i mean she never gets in trouble at school. she gets there and back all by herself. i think she's the only one in the house who knows how to make the pictureinpicture work. yeah, but she sleeps until noon on the weekends. she uses the pictureinpicture to watch mtv and cartoons at the same time. i got to go check on her. no, you do not. do you know how much it meant to her that you trusted her. okay, i'll tell you what. i'll just sneak in, look in a window. she'll never even know i'm there. okay. if i let you go do you promise me that you'll come right back here and eat your meal in peace. yeah. okay. but she'd better not know you're there. i swear she will never forgive you. okay and i won't forgive you till she does. look. it hold up newspaper. cut it out, matt. look. it holds up mom's cat calendar. gordo, can you get him to quit that. you're in charge, you do it could you at least help. you didn't come here to watch tv on the couch. fine. i'll watch tv in your room. miranda, get me more paper towels. pass. i'm building a tenstory shopping mall for mirandaville. well, mirandaville doesn't need a tenstory shopping mall. we need a hospital. fine. i'll go drink some orange juice and make a mall out of that. fine. nobody help me do anything. look. it holds up dad's briefcase. i'll just handle everything by myself. um i may need a little help here. i hate it when dad's right. what's that. i'm scared. look at mei'm a monster. ha, ha, ha, ha. i see dead people. cut it out, matt. ugh. that stinks. it's vanilla. it's soothing. works like a charm. yuck. who's burning garbage. i'm trying to get some light in here and if you're not going to help me, you can at least hush up. don't tell us to hush up. we're not babies. you're acting like babies. it's a shame there isn't a decent babysitter around. i'm sure there'll be a decent babysitter around next time 'cause i obviously can't handle it. what was that. do you think it's a burglar. nah. itit's probably just a raccoon. they root around in in the trash and stuff. yeah, probably just a raccoon. letlet's make noise just in case. my country, 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty of thee i sing ii'm, i'm going to go and flip the circuit breaker so we can play some loud music. real music. hello. what is taking so long. ahh all the curtains are shut and i

officer, i live here. my kids are inside. i just came home to check on them. yes. hello, young lady. is this man your father. i don't know. why would my father be sneaking around in the bushes late at night. maybe that means he doesn't trust me. lizzie it's my father. good night, sir. and by the way, your lawn gnome's broken. you were supposed to trust me. yes, we were, and we didn't stick to our word and we were wrong. they're admitting they were wrong. ah. call the news crew. film at 11:00. it's not that i don't trust you, sweetheart. i guess i still just think of you as the sixyearold girl that used to need me to chase the monsters out of her closet. i guess i have to get used to the fact that you're not that little girl anymore. you're becoming a young lady and i have to let you act like one. so, i can go on a real date. no. will you teach me how to drive. no. can i dye my hair. no. well, what can i do. you can babysit matt next saturday night. yeah. so the more responsibility i
