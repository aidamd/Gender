guys, guys, guys at 13, you'd think i can run and talk at the same time. forget lunch. forget eating. the cafeteria food's not that bad. you could save the stuff on your shirt for later. oh forget that. aaron cartercoming here. are you speaking in code. explain yourself. pronto. aaron carter is coming here to shoot his new music video christmas special. i'm going to aaron's party. this better not be a joke. it's not a joke. hhis holiday video shoots tomorrow. wwait, isn't that kind of early. i mean, it is still spring. it's a film thing. they need,like,ten months to fill in all the special effects. so who's aaron carter. so where's it going to be. i don't know. it's a secret, but we're going to find out. bet it would be real helpful to ask a guy who knows about films to figure out where they'd shoot the video. where. where. first you back up and tell me who this aaron carter is. okay. he's a singer, a dancer and he's only 13. so this would probably be a lot more exciting if i was a 13yearold girl. so where do you think it shoots. i don't know. but i bet it won't be that difficult to figure it out i could interview aaron carter for the school web scene. ii've already got my press badge from mr. ling. that should get us in. i am so there. maybe i could sing for him. it'd be pretty cool to go to a real set. hey, i could do one of those behindthescenes documentaries. they kill at the major film festivals. i'm in. soall we have to do is figure out where it shoots. and how to get in. and how to meet him. no problem. tomorrow i have a date with destiny. what am i going to wear. season 1 episode 7 aaron carter's coming to town if you believe, we've got a pictureperfect plan we've got you fooled 'cause we only do the best we can and sometimes we make it and sometimes we fake it but we get one step closer each and every day we'll figure it out on the way. lizzie mcguire s01e07 aaron carter's coming to town so, gordo,what's the game plan. well, a video shoot needs lots of space so it's got to be somewhere bigenough room for the crew, the equipment and of course, the set. oh, and aaron. can't forget aaron. what about the mall. the mall's big. hmm popular choice for an upandcoming singer. this is a cinch. i can snoop out secret video shoots in my sleep. hey, kids. hey, mom. hey, mrs. mcguire. lizzie, your dad's working late tonight so, i thought i'd order a pizza. sweet. extra cheese, please. okay. you guys going to stay for dinner. mrs. mcguire, have we ever turned down a free meal. i'll take that as a yes. i've called everywhere. i have no idea where the shoot is. i thought you said this was going to be easy to figure out. i was wrongwell, how do we know that this aaron carter thing isn't a hoax. like that rumor that the school cafeteria serves squirrel. it's no lie. i don't remember calling in toad boy for backup. i thought the deal was that you could come in my room on the condition that you didn't speak. not even close. oh, and how would you know. lenny told me. so what do you guys think. i think he's telling the truth. well, how do we get him to tell us. well, we've got to give him something. what do we give him. lava lamps make good gifts. what do you want. i want to come with. no. yes he's not coming with. he's got to. he's the only one who knows where it is. he did pass as a super genius at school for half a day. his quirky charm could be useful. fine. you can come. so tell us where it is. the renmar warehouses. thanks. have fun hanging with mom and dad tomorrow. if you ditch me i'll rat you out. just when i thought i was out, he pulls me back in. i thought you'd see it my way. fine. tomorrow morning,early, in the backyard and don't wake the 'rents. oh. i thought you'd never get home. you must be exhausted. i am exhausted. are you hungry. there's leftover pizza. no, i had dinner with a client. who. mick moral. that guy never stops talking. but you know, he gave me these backstage passes to aaron carter think the kids will want them. great. we'll surprise them in the morning. they'll love them. okay. i left a note saying that i'm working on a project with you guys and matt's helping. do we have everything. camera and an extra batterycheck. cool. i've got my tape recorder for the interview and my school press badge. that should be enough to get us in. so, uh, what's the plan. we'll just breeze through security like we own the place. that's the plan. do you have a better one. no. then that's the plan. oh, great. you made it. what's in the bag. do you guys have a plan. yeah. then this is for when your plan fails. okay. remember. . walk in like you own the place. aaron carter walked on this ground. i am never wearing these shoes again. that's not acting like you own the place. excuse me. may i see your passes, please. let me handle this i'm lizzie mcguire, a member of the press. i have a right to be here. dear mom and dad, i'm working on a project with miranda and gordo, matt is also
