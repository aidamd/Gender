out, lizzie. flattery goes a long way. i mean, he's sensitive, he's funny. i mean, you could tell by the way he played that part don't you think. i can't wait to tell him how good he was. yeah, i'm sure he'll appreciate it. so, how do i look. he should be walking by any minute. i usually see him between classes. yeah, you look great. except for that you're sweating a little bit. i am. where. look in the mirror. oh, right. oh. ow. uh, buhbye. lizzie, are you okay. oh. yeah, yeah, yeah. just help me up. sure. ooh, there's ryan. ooh. hi. uh, hi. hi. i, um, um, uh did you want to talk to me.

amazing amazing. yeah, she wanted to say that you were amazing. amazing. ryan. amazing. thanks. so, um well i guess i'll see you guys later. yeah. yeah. ugh, what is wrong with you. you couldn't even talk to him. you were totally freaking me out. you're freaked out. i just reminded myself of you just now. hey. this has never happened to me before. what do i do. maybe you just got nervous. lizzie, this is me you're talking to. i don't get nervous. that's you. hey again. well, maybe you just have to try talking to him again. see what happens. i can't. ii choke. i stammer. i sweat. i don't sweat. whoa, snap out of it. sorry. this love stuff is freaky. hey, matt. i'm so bored. where's lanny. quarantined. highly contagious toe infection. ugh. what about oscar. his family wants him to stay away from me for a week. he's the one who wanted to see if his skin would prune if he stood out in the rain all day. i merely encouraged his curiosity. so, did it prune. uhuh. so, uh, where's lizzie. with miranda. talking about some boy. ugh. here i am, thinking that eavesdropping on my sister would be fun, but, my bad. it's so boring. i know. lizzie and miranda are my best friends but when they get in that boy mode, there's, like, no talking to them. personally, i don't get why you talk to them at all. i just wish they were into the same stuff as me. i like the monster truck roundup. it's coming to town, you know. anyway. say, how do you do that. here, it's easy. just watch. sometimes i think my life would be so much easier if lizzie were a guy. yeah. i think my life would be easier if i had an older brother. you know, someone cool. someone fun. someone who could teach me stuff. here, you want to try. hey. what. you and me, you know, we could hang. yeah, i guess. sure, why not. i always knew you were too cool to be friends with my dorky sister. okay, let's have a practice conversation. i'm going to be ryan and you be you, okay. i guess. okay. hey, miranda, i like your sweater. uh, thanks, lizzie, but this is a tshirt. miranda, i'm ryan. oh, right, right. thanks, ryan. how are you. i'm doing good. you know, you should come to one of my plays sometime. i'd love to. see, that wasn't so hard. no. just lame. come on, miranda. at least you were able to have a conversation with him. yeah, because it was you. okay, we're going to make this really easy for you. we're going to write down everything that you have to say to ryan. that way, next time you see him you won't be so nervous, okay. when i'm good, i am really good. but i'm no good at memorizing. so, we'll make it short. don't worry, it'll be fine, okay. thanks. so, uh, where's your partner in crime. oh, miranda's talking to ryan. i thought she got all nervous and sweaty and tonguetied around him. she did, until i wait i thought you said you didn't want to hear any more girl talk. i don't, but since when do you listen to me. i listen to you a lot. oh, and matt told me to tell you that the monster truck roundup has been postponed, or something. oh, no. it has. are you, like, friends with my little brother now. because i got to tell you, gordo, that's kind of creepy. what can i say. the kid's got spunk. it's refreshing. bye, ryan. see you tomorrow. oh, my gosh. tell me everything. no, no. not everything, please. ryan said he wanted to have lunch with me tomorrow. i knew writing down what to say would work. you wrote down what she should say. he said i have nice eyes. you wrote down what she should say. and when i went on about his smile, he actually blushed. you wrote down what she should say. it's in the name of love. get with the program, gordo. yes, gordo, i wrote out a few words for miranda to say to ryan, okay. but look, now they have a date. that's that's genius. like i saidwhen i'm good, i'm really good. i told you that you and ryan would be h&h. this is so awesome. thanks to you. just meet me here a few minutes before lunch to go over what we're going to say. okay. wait. what. i need you to be here without actually being here. understand. finally gets interesting. i don't know, miranda. all you have to do is hide somewhere close listen to the way the conversation is going and tell me what to say back to him. i won't be so nervous if you're here. please. okay, this is the worst idea i've ever heard. there is no way i'm doing that. so, you'll come, right. yeah, totally. he kicks he scores. that was awesome. we've got to invent games more often. i never do stuff like this with lizzie. of course not. all this running around would make her "break a nail. " got that right. i knew having an older brother would rock. i mean i know what you mean. come on, let's go get into some trouble. ow. ooh. i think i just got stung by something. lizzie, get down before someone sees you. you know it smells in here, miranda don't you. that's what makes you such a good friend. ugh. oh, ooh, here comes ryan. my heart's depending on you. hi, miranda. thanks for having lunch with me. thanks for inviting me. thanks for inviting me. please sit. uh, please sit. ow. ow. ooh, i think i just got stung again ooh, i think i just got stung again. i mean how fun again, ha. yeah, this is fun. oh, yeah. can you hold on one second. i'm just going to throw this quit fooling around, mcguire. i need you. i know, i know, but there's, like a bee in here or something. oh, come on. ryan is waiting. okay, uh, uh, you look nice. oh, thank you. not you. oh. you look nice, ryan. thanks, so do you. so, how are so, how are how are how are how are ah ah ah ah ah are you okay. ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ahchoo. oh what are you doing here. why are you hiding in the trash can. ah, no, ah uh, yeah, lizzie what are you doing here. no, i can explain. yeah, well i kind of have this thing, uh see you later, miranda. but, ah he hates me. he'll never speak to me again. oh, we'll never go on a second date. i'll never get a first kiss or or a wedding. come on, miranda. all you have to do is go talk to him and tell him the truth. okay. it's going to be fine. not a big deal. i can't, lizzie. i can't be near him. bad things happen. i've got to go. oh, hey, gordo. i thought you left after dinner. i tried, but matt challenged me to a game of hackybasket. that kid never tires, does he. mmm have you talked to miranda. she's not answering her phone. nah, i guess she's still upset about that whole thing with ryan. d'oh. why do i keep talking about that stuff. i was just trying to help, and now she's all angry at me. well, why don't you try talking to ryan. tell him what happened. there i go again. it's like a disease. maybe i should try that. i could talk to ryan. that's a great idea. hey, gordo. i found this web siteit's all about cheese. sorry, little man, but i've got to get going. how about another round of hackybasket, then. matt, do you remember when i was talking to you about responsibility. not really. look, i've got to go. i've got homework to do and i've got to pair up my socks. they never seem to match anymore. see, that's what happens when you start hanging out with m. c. dorkalot. you, too become a dork. you're one to talk, lil' dim. if you don't want to play hackybasket, i'll show you the web site. it's about cheese. a guy actually built a house out of it. wow. cheese house. how cool. wait a second. a guy built a house out of cheese. what kind of cheese. gordo, i was being sarcastic. they have pictures. well, i guess my homework's going to have to wait. yes.  hear me now, like you did back then with an underground feeling and a solid gold, also feel me now, like you did back then with an overgrown feeling, tried to steal my soul got so scared, got so tired doing everything wrong, doing everything right look, ryan, we need to talk. yeah, we do. look, the whole reason i was telling miranda you don't need to explain. i don't. uhuh. i totally get it. you do. don't be shy around me, lizzie. i like you. what. i think it's cute you had miranda do all the talking for you. uh, you've got this all backwards, ryan. see, what we were doing and that's all we were doing. i couldn't quite hear everything you said. let's pick this up later, okay. um, the digital bean after school. later. wha. no, i'm not i miranda, you are never going to believe what just happened. how could you do this to me. what are you talking about. do what. i was just explaining to ryan everything that was going on. oh, yeah, that's why ryan just asked you out. miranda, you don't save it, lizzie. you've said enough. and people who believe in me i got miles and miles of things to see oh, yes. okay, four out of five. winner gets to shortsheet lizzie's bed. matt, we've been playing this game for five hours. and my bedtime's not for another three. look, we need to have a talk. i know you're going to find this hard to believe but i miss lizzie. miranda, too. hey, you know what. we can glue lizzie's favorite chips together. that way, when she goes to open the bag they all come out in one big clump. but you've already put peanut butter in her shoes. actually, it was jelly but i'll remember that peanut butter for next time. you know, matt, we've had a lot of fun these past couple of days. tons of fun. the hanging out. uh, the hackybasket. cheese house. but the truth is i really need to start hanging out with lizzie again. that's crazy talk. come on, let's go see if there's anything of lizzie's lying around we can destroy. sorry, little buddy, no can do. she's one of my best friends, and believe it or not she and i have a lot in common. but she's so boring. look, you're only tenyearsold. you have plenty of time to do stuff before you become boring. invent another game. learn to juggle. build your very own cheese house. hey, now you're talking. well, i'm going to go now. but we can still hang out on occasion. really. when. whenever. mm, tomorrow. mm, no. this weekend. mm, no. how about the next time the monster truck roundup's in town. cool. ugh, i don't need to be here. yes, you do. good, you made it. i got us a table, lizzie. bye. miranda, wait. lizzie, it's okay. like i told you before you don't have to be so shy around me. miranda doesn't have to do the talking for you. okay, that's it. gloves are coming off. walls are coming down. i'll show you who's shy. ryan, look wait, what did you say. "ryan, look". not you. you. i said you don't have to do the talking for lizzie anymore. i'm sure she'll find her voice now that everything is out in the open. wait a second. in the monologue you were so much smarter than this. so insightful and sensitive. ah, the curse of the good actor. people don't see you. they only see the person you're playing. you know what. i think that's been my problem. i didn't fall for you. i fell for the guy you were playing. love is so complicated. wait a minute. you're the one that likes me. let's make that "liked.
