 headquarters, g2 reporting.  highergy beam from iron island has successfully reached its target.   roger.  cyrus, sir, the beam has reached mount coronet exactly as planned.  in addition, we're detecting a powerful energy source coming directly from mount ronet, much like the one from iron island.  we can assume spear pillar is located somewhere within this zone of energy.  we are now pinpointing its precise location.   maintain current beamenergy levels.  and as for mars, tell her to stand by.  yes, sir.  mars, maintain current status and await further orders.   use thunderbolt on

did you locate the bombs .  no, lucario did.  the explosives are all located directly below the ruins but since you all saved lucario and the other pokmon, i would say it's our turn now .  lucario and i will find a way to take care of those bombs so you guys go help your friends .   right .  time until we're safe to detonate .  sir, three minutes.  lucario, how many explosives .  i can't even count

what's goin' on ..  what about riley ..   pika.  piplup.   quick .  we have to get this away from the island now .  okay, let's go .      location, location...  where's riley and lucario .   pika .  look, over there .   riley, are you okay .. yeah.  was that the power of aura that did that .  that's right.  you know, those bombs were powerful.  but all's well that ends well.   skar .  skar, skar .  pika .  we're looking money on our car insurance.  at progressive, you can compare rates side by side, so you get the same coverage, often for less.  wow.  that is huge.   and this is to remind you that you could save hundreds.  yeah, that'll certainly stick with me.  we'll take it.  go, big money.  i mean, go.  it's your break, honey.  same coverage, more savings.  now, that's progressive.  call or click today.  g me with team galactic .  so they all think our world isn't good enough for them, do they ..  they're not worth the gum on my shoe .   it's team rocket that rocks this world and any other world too .  here, here .  and with carnivine powering up by leaps and bounds, out team truly dumbfounds .  they may be a couple of mooshes, but they get an "a" for saving the day.  you said it, baby .  anchors away . anchors away .   hey, it's carolina .  if it isn't the upstarts .  great to see you .  so that's it .  yup .  the iron ruins.  they really exist.   fascinating, this machine is made from the exact same compound as the meteor from veilstone city .   veilstone city .   does that mean they made it from the meteor they stole out of the park .  almost certainly.  it's been said that iron island was originally an ancient meteor.  long ago.  meteor island.  does that mean the iron ruins were created from a meteor too .  i'd say so.  both the iron island ruins and this machine are giving off a special frequency.  these two frequencies must have resonated creating a sound wave causing the steeltypes to go crazy .  that's it .  okay.  so you're saying the entire island is made up of the same compound as the veilstone city meteors .  yes, that's right.  most likely team galactic was able to pinpoint the location of the iron ruins by using thisthis machine as a radar.  not only that, but it is also rumored to reveal the location of spear pillar, which is necessary to summon dialga and palkia into this world.  spear pillar, carolina .  supposedly, it's located somewhere in the sinnoh region.  the name's riley, isn't it .  i hear you've been on the island for a while.  would you be able to give us a little assistance while we survey the nearby areas .  sure, i'm always interested in learning more about this island.   man, sounds like you guys got caught up in something pretty complicated.  well, yeah, barry, i guess we did.  but my goal's to win the sinnoh league, get it ..  getting my next badge's all i'm thinkin' about .  pika .  you sound like me.  but i'm doing lots of training.  you just make sure you're in the sinnoh league .  right .  so good luck, barry .  pip, piplup .  take good care .  if you happen to see paul, you tell him there's a powerful opponent waiting for him .  and if you don't i'll have to fine you .  yeah, right .  see you .  yeah .   empoleon.   pikachu.  barry, riley and lucario.  with timeless experiences and memories engraved in their hearts, our heroes board the ferry headed for chocovine town.  but in the back of their minds, as team galactic's ambition slowly reveals itself, they know it will shake the sinnoh region to its core.  i know our plan to obliterate the iron ruins was a failure, and i ask your forgiveness, cyrus, sir.  a failed mission is nothing but a temporary setback.  regardless, we must move forward.  so, saturn...  the excavation of spear pillar will be led by you.   as you wish.
