servant.   wow, servant, huh.   everyday it's "do this, "  jessie: i didn't tell you to buy bread, i told you to buy bread.   or james with his stupid soda.   how am i supposed to collect bottle caps when you buy cans.   it never ends.   we don't throw away, we recycle.   or dis.   not crackers, chips.   or that.  you see, every moment of every day i wanna break the bonds of stinkin' servitude,

break into the broadcasting biz without a contact.   well, i just happen to know the host ofsinnoh now.   gimme an intro.  gimme an intro.   i would think we'd be able to track rhonda down if we put out the word over at the pokemon center.   good thinking, brock.  i wanna check up on staravia and croagunk, too.   i'll eat to that.   mime mime mime.   star.  star.  star.  star.  star star star
