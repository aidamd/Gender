jeremiah, first again .  pay day, ma'am.  and that's another correct answer .  how does he do it .  pika.  excuse me, you're a meowth, why didn't you know .  i'm dressed up as a person so i didn't wanna blow my cover,capisce.  excuse me . yes, what is it .  this quiz is supposed to have something to do with battles, right .  i came here to learn about battling.  all right then.  class, is there anybody else here who was wondering the same thing .  so, you see, class, my quick quiz was designed to help tune your reflexes razorsharp.  in a quiz or a battle, if you can learn to read a situation accurately, it will work to your advantage.  when in a battle, your pokmon actually does the battling, leaving all decisions to the trainer.  what we're doing here is classroom exercises that will help you become a trainer your pokmon can believe in.  i should know as an exgym leader, she's definitely telling it straight.  that's my ms. senior .   this stinks.  relax.  you simply show off your true power when you're in a battle, see .  desktype work .  that's really not your thing.   i wondered about that.  jeremiah .  for a trainer with six badges, you don't seem to know that much.  to be honest, i'm surprised .  hey, i'll do better next time.  i would hope so.  huh.  don't worry.  it doesn't change the fact that you're a genius at gym battles, really .  yeah, maybe.  hey, where's dawn and the gang .   piplup .  wow, it's still here .  piplup .  pip, pip, pip...   so what is this place .  what do you think it is .  ms. senior .  this is where it all started for zozo and me.  started .  right, dawn, started .  this is where zozo and i raised glameow together.  dawn . ashhey, guys.  okay, you know how stubborn zozo is.  ms. senior .  well, with good reason .  you know exactly what i mean, don't you, glameow .  meow.  i first met glameow one supercold morning when i was onmy way to school.  i just couldn't leaveglameow like that, so i brought it back home.  but my parents told me icouldn't have a pokmon until i was a trainer and to take glameowto the pokmon center.  so at that moment, i decided to aiseglameow right here.  i made a promise to myself thatwhen i became a trainer, i would makeglameow my partner.  wow, that's such an amazing story, zoey.  meow.  she tried to keep it quiet, but mr. honcho found out right away.  i refused to give it up.  and that's when ms. seniorstepped in and stood up for me.  eventually, mr. honcho gave in but it was on condition that both zozo and i would be raising our dear glameow.  of course .  that explains why glameow is zoey's numberone partner.  now don't tell me zozoe you an earful about not approving of trainers that wanna compete in both gym battles and contests, right .  i remember something about that .  yeah, at the jubilife contest where we first met her .  pika .  but as you can see, it's not always a bad thing to have a bit of a stubborn streak.   ms. senior decided to put all her efforts into battling, while i decided to enter contests and become top coordinator .  you see, in order to reach the very top, we promised each other we would concentrate on pursuing only one career path.  trainers that try to do both look like they're not taking it seriously.  and ms. senior gets so mad and says it's doing way too much stuff.  too much is more than enough, you know .  tell me, dawn, you've got four ribbons now, right .  right .  although i did just attempt to win my fifth ribbon and i lost.  but for some reason i feel relieved.  relieved .  well, since zoey has four ribbons like me, it's almost like we're feeling the same inside.  the same ..  look, you two are rivals now, aren't you .  you think you're gonna win with an attitude like that ..  where is yourkiai..  yipes. pika.  i suspected it during the quick quiz, toohow intee she gets in a winorlose situation.  i'll bet she really brings it in a battle.  yeah.  it's okay kids, we'll comeback to the sea new lunchablesturkey and cheddar
