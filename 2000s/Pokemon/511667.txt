for the folks living around here.  it did everything it could to ..  always messing with the fruit the villagers were trying to pick, and destroying everybody's homes.  nothing could be done to stop that nasty spiritomb and those villagers were one step away from being at their wits end.  when all of a sudden, an aura guardian came wandering right into their village.   an aura guardian.   and this aura guardian had a pikachu with him.  they told him about their troubles, and he battled spiritomb on behalf of the village.  then, after bravely defeating spiritomb, the aura guardian sealed it in a keystone deep inside a stone hallowed tower to make certain it wouldn't cause anyone any harm again.  the village was saved, and everyone lived happily ever after.  so, you wanted to hear the legend and now ya have.   hallowed tower, huh.   made out of stone, huh.   are you thinking what i'm thinking.   argh.  the stone hallowed tower's nothing but a heap a' rubble.  you kids did this, didn't you.     it was just an accident, see.   we were using buizel's sonic boom when we mistakenly knocked it down.   of course, there's no way we could've known anything about your legend.   so it was you, ya little pipsqueaks.   all: we're really sorry and we won't do it again.   pika pika.  pikachu.    first it's sealed up by the aura guardian and his pikachu and now that awful wicked spiritomb's been unsealed by a wellmeaning, but reckless group of kids wh a young man who just happens to have a pikachu too.  those ways of fate can sure be mighty strange.   since we're the ones who broke that seal, we'll make it right.  you can count on it.   well that's mighty big talk but you'd better keep in mind that spiritomb is one mean and nasty pokemon.   excuse me but we happened to overhear all that big talk.   whoa who are you.   moi.  i'm a renowned combination mystic psychic and hairdresser.   and i'm her guy friday.   you mean like the ones on tv that tell celebrities about their past lives and predict their future.   i can see what can't be seen and tell what can't be told.  ..  like i'm going to do now.  you with the pikachu.    mme.   it's as clear as your clueless stare.  the stars tell me that your spirit guide is conducting pokemon research.  a true, blue pokemon man.  i see him.  red shirt, white lab coat, endlessly writing pokemon poems.   hey, that's professor oak.   but, just one thing he's still alive.   he sure is.   and i can see your past lives.  .   you're all good at that clueless stare stuff.  you lived once as slowpoke.   you mean i was a

wants something from pikachu.   huh.  like what.   pika.   well then, mustn't let mister nasty wait.  chop chop.  come along.   tomb.   i will now reseal this floating troublemaker by utilizing my

don't.   being clueless can be a bad habit.  i don't have to be psychic ..   especially when dealing with twerpish youth.   on the wind.   the stars.   yeah forsooth.   bringing chaos at a break neck pace.   dashing hope, putting fear in its place.   a mystic psychic by any other name is just as smart.   we've turned fooling you dumb twerps into an art.   jessie.   and james.   meowth, that's a

up.  but please, please for badness sake.   all: just once.  give us a break.   tomb. spiritomb tomb.   you get that.   well i'm the only one speaking the lingo around here.  spiritomb wants revenge bigtime on the aura guardian that sealed it up in that keystone.   now let's review.  how long ago did this take place.  r soomr  those who live in the past are doomed to repeat it.  before we hash this out, look.  chow.   hasta la vista.   spiritomb.   staravia.   staravia, did ya spot spiritomb yet.   star. star.   where do you think spiritomb could have gone.   what if spiritomb found .   guys, we've gotta make sure that doesn't happen.   wait.  we just saw spiritomb chasing team rocket, right.   uh huh.   so, that means if we can lure team rocket here then spiritomb may come along too.   you're right.  that might work.   yeah.  especially since nothing else has.  what next.   okay, here's the plan.  listen up.   scary but not too smart.   spiritomb's as feisty as an aura
