ash:  hey, dawn, they loved it.   pika.   yeah, you sure grabbed the spotlight.  i wonder if i made a mistake getting involved in this.  no need to worry.  it'll be fine.   nah, this is much too subdued.  we need to give it some more color.   i'm tellin ya it looks great.   then i'll just have to show you how to balance a bland face with my colorful personality.   next up are all my handmade accessories.  the object here is simplicity and beauty, and they're probably my finest work.   wow. can't wait to see them.   next up is entry number 19, the contestant jessilina with her pokemon wobbuffet.   hi.     that's simplicity.   my wonderful work has been hijacked.  they look like they tried to kiss a makeup truck.   moving fast.   my finest work has been reduced to subway graffiti.   even pretty faces need to hop to it.   wobbuffet.      talk about garish.  a new low in bad taste.   how will i face my cosmetologist friends.   but outlandish makeup aside, your accessories still look awesome.   you mean it.   sure.  those simple accessories are the perfect match for wobbuffet's round body type.  it all works perfectly, forgetting all that makeup.  it must be awfully frustrating to be so close to bringing out wobbuffet's unique beauty.    i can't begin to thank you for being sensitive enough to truly understand.   and now it's time for entry number 20.  it's the pride of hearthome city, cocoa and her mismagius.    all right, time to see what cocoa is made of.   dear mismagius, won't you please show everyone your lovely dress now.   mismagius.   all right, mismagius, psywave.  ..  magius.     oh.  what an incredible sight.   beautiful.   an insult to the designer community to see such a tawdry gimmick.   hmm, though not an easy act for dawn to follow.  all the contest experience i've gotten so far.  i can't waste it.   enta: and now for our final entry, number 21, dawn and her pokemon buneary.   no need to worry.  buneary, let's go.   buneary.    coming after lady cocoa, they seem particularly plain.   true, but simplicity can be strong and effective.  hmm.   okay, buneary.  you're on a white mountain of snow, and you're a snow spirit.   buneary.  bun bun.  bun bun.  buneary.  buneary.  buneary.   all right, use ice beam.   buneary.  buneary.  buneary.   that's it.  the accessories and fashions aren't the important thing for you, because you're the star of the show, buneary.   huh.   bun. bun. bun.  bun bun bun.   hmm.   oh,tres bien.  oui, tres bien.   buuuuuun.  buneary.     your accessories are the best i've seen.  simplicity is best.   then you understand, too.   true.    what a show.  that was great.   pikachu.   enta: the results are in.  we've narrowed the number of poke stylist entrants down to three finalists.  from those three, we'll choose a winner, a first runnerup, which recognizes best accessories, and a special award thrown in for good measure.  our first finalist is number 18.  that's ash and his pikachu.   all right.  we did it, pikachu.   ready for my cue.   our next entrant is number 20.  lady cocoa, queen of hearthome city.  .  wait. the name is jessilina.   i expected no less.   and our final pick is none other than entrant number 21.  and that's dawn.   dawn, that's me.  buneary, we did it.   buneary.   our awards will be divided up among these fine entrants.   of course the rest of you notalents are only here to make me look fabulous.    after all the underhanded skewering jessie did to all of my handiwork, i'll skewer her.  huh.    you're the skeweree, see.   if you hadn't assumed the role of hearthome collection clown, you'd be part of that trio of style toppers.   when i want your drivelfilled diatribe, i'll ask for it.  the way those judges didn't appreciate my colorful persona, they must need glasses.   your makeup called for blindfolds.   what did you say.   i didn't hear anything.   meowth, now that we've been wronged, what say we right the situation by taking every .   you bet. i'm your man.   and now, on to our three awards.    oh, my, what's that.     get that thing out of here.   you know, you could use a little makeup, too.   please, a pompous platitude coming from you.   on the wind.   what's the point.   yoo hoo.   bringing chaos at a breakneck pace.   wow, i'm so excited.  can you tell by my face.   a rose by any other name's just as red.   i knew that i should've stayed at home in bed.   mmmm, jessie.   james, poor me.   it's meowth, to a tee.   putting the dogooders in their place.  ..   in your face.   out of the way, team rocket.   no one gives me advice and gets away with it.  out of the hearthome collection, or i'll throw you out on your bad jokes.   hermione.  please be careful.   first off, i suggest we take the accessories from that queen for a day and then the plain jane twerp, and finish off with jungle boy.   sure with joy.   aah.   look out.  quick, buneary, use dizzy punch.   bun bun.  bun bun, bun bun bun.   i hate floppy ears.  point this ride to the other side.   with pride.   pip.  pip piplup. pip.   piplup, no.   piplup piplup.  pip piplup.   all right, lopunny, hidden power.   lopunny.   i got you.   pip piplup.   all right, genius, status.   that lopunny's hidden power just gave our mecha a milkshake migraine.  yipes.   ready.   right.   now, lopunny, bounce.   now, buneary, bounce.   lopunny.  lopunny.   buneary.    i still say i should have been the big winner.   ugh.  with your makeup you were the big weiner.  .   i would consider this a good day.   we're blasting off again.  ]] all right, folks, let's try this once again.  this year's special award goes to the duo with exceptional uniqueness, and that goes to ash and pikachu.   yeah.  we got the unique award.   pika pika.   that was a splendid usage of ash's pikachu.  tres bien.  and also,trescute.   of course, we already know who the winner is.   and now the lovely paris will announce our big winner.   thanks.  ..   hmm.   mm.   bun.   the amazing team of dawn and buneary.   yippee.  .   bun bun bun.   pi pikachu.  piplup. pip.    but i'm supposed to win.  this doesn't make one bit of sense at all.   ah, but the accessory award is perfect for you.  after all, it was only your dress and accessories that stood out.  you see, darling, you completely forgot about showing off your mismagius.   i just loved the way you used your accessories so well.  simple things that showed off your buneary great.  tres bien.   right.  and you did it in the true spirit of a poke stylist.   thanks.   well, i was the one who made the accessories, you know.   then, of course, you were tres bientoo.   blast.  i could just die.    now if it's all right with you, dawn, i'd like you to start work on poke chic right away.   oh, thank you so much.  but you see, my goal is to become a top contest coordinator.  and there's still a lot of work i need to do with my pokemon.   buneary.   piplup.   i understand.  make your pokemon shine in contests like they did today.   thanks.   narrator:and so, the hearthome collection has provided both dawn and ash with new and valuable experiences.  as will celestic town, no doubt our heroes' next destination and home of the next pokemon contest.  excu fire.  now, look how your replace dad, conce oh. oh, gosh.  ohh. oh, go, go, gadget snow.  mommhirrg]  ohh. oh, no. go back.  good, good, good, goodat way, and that's an order.  you got it.  wh ooh.  well ohh. ohh.  ohh.  started raining down everywhere.  at first they seemed harmless enough so a bunch of us kids invented this cool new game...  that's when we realized those cards weren't so harmless after all.  they were packed with incredible powers from another world.  my name is dan, and together with my friends, runo...  marucho...  julie...  not to mention mr. hotshot himself, shun...  and alice, we are...  the bakugan battle brawlers.  bakugan.  one goal... two worlds.  . what are you going to do. .  . the odds are stacked against you .  . back against the wall .  . gotta give it your all... .  . ah ha ah ha .  . this is the final stand .  . ah ha ah ha .  . the power's in your hand .  . two worlds collide .  . on the inside .  . you gotta fight for what's right .  . before it's gone, gone, gone .  . this is bakugan. .  bakugan battle brawlers.  so, ya chicken.  ahhhanother lackey of masquerade's.  yeah, this is starting to get old...  but just for fun, let me show him who's boss.  no way, i call dibs on this creep.  hey, no fair.  dan, wait.  field open.  come on, drago... defense.  must... resist...  drago.  hold on.  no fair.  you're butting in, dan.  you just got lucky, that's all.  i'll be back, ya freaks.  so i'm guessing you beat him.  way to go, dan.  i had total confidence you could do it.  ah, it was nothin'...  i had him on the ropes...  dan, no.  are you okay.  can you hear me.  wake up, dan.  man, that was way up there on the freaky scale...  i remember i beat the dude, but after that, it's a total blank...  oh that was so hilarious, dan.  the way that wannabe brawler ran with his tail between his legs.  well, it is kinda your own fault, mr... buttinski.  i knew this would turn into a snoozefest.  i'm just lucky that drago was tough enough to take that chump out when he did.  according to my data, we will face much stronger opponents...  i might suggest our strategy should reflect this in any future battles...  in english...  meaning a bakugan is at his peak when all of its six attributes are in perfect alignment...  dan's bakugan is drago and it's a pyrus...  a fire attribute...  yours is a haos...  a light attribute...  and my preyas is classified as an aquos...  that's water.  but the problem is, combined, we don't have enough attributes to fight at full power...  add on julie's which is subterra, )
