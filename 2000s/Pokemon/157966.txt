 no.   'fraid so, dawn.  team rocket.   team rocket.   they're just an annoying bunch of pokemon thieves who're always butting into our lives.   yeah, what lives.   whoever's got the orb's the bell of the ball.     seems you want what we've got.   team galactic's not so hot.   we grabbed the gusto 'cause we're johnny on the spot.   you're not funny.   give us the orb while you can.   you're quite a champion at hurling empty threats, too.   though i'd stick to pokemon if i were you.   zip it, we got work to do.   wobbuffet.   you dopes make one wrong move, and there'll be lustrous linguine all over this lobby, capiche.   good.  you're only half as dumb as you look.      although we'd love to stay and continue this funfest, we do have a boss to tend to.   meowth: freeze weirdo.   i think you should leave.     excellent.  fashionable and generous to a fault.   together: time to vault.    huh.  where's team galactic.   probably going after the lustrous orb.   cynthia, we should go after it too.   hold on, ash.  what about chimchar and croagunk.     i know just how you feel.  but right now, shouldn't you be helping out these brave pokemon of yours who battled so hard for us all.   oh, chimchar.   chimchar.   of course cynthia's right.  now you two just leave getting the lustrous orb back to us.   huh.   ash and dawn, is everything all right.   brock.   how's croagunk.   i'm really sorry, brock.   you really put up a great battle, croagunk.  and i'm so proud of you.  ash, what about the orb.   team rocket stole it.   i don't believe it.   we've got everything here under control.  you all should get to a pokemon center.  cynthia, you should go too.   i will.  garchomp, i'd like you to handle everything with the orb, please.     then i know just what to do, too.  staravia.   staravia.   i want you to go with garchomp and find team rocket now.   star.  staravia.   we're countin' on ya, staravia.   you know cyrus, i'm so sorry that your visit had to turn out like this.   don't be.  it's all my fault for asking to see the orb.  forgive me.   you're both wrong.  the fault is mine.  don't forget that i'm the one who took the orb out and put it in harm's way.   jupiter: g3 is in, roger that.  commencing backup plan.  now that they've foolishly let team rocket get away with the orb, it's our turn to take care of things.   yes, ma'am.  we'll use the spear key to track their moves.   excellent.  it's already begun to work.   joy: okay, ash, brock, have them take these after breakfast and after dinner as well.   right.   if you need me, just call.   chansey.   now, croagunk, i know you're still very upset, but you've got to rest.   croa.   chimchar, thanks for looking out for pikachu.   pika pika.   char.   if only i hadn't said to use volt tackle in the first place.   come on, you shouldn't be so hard on yourself.   piplup.   worse than that, i was so wrapped up in getting that orb back, i wasn't thinking about you at all.  i'm sorry.   chim.   huh.   char.   chimchar.   ash, i've been meaning to ask you if your chimchar was actually paul's chimchar once.   yeah.   hmm.   char.   you've certainly been through quite a lot.  haven't you, my sweetheart.   chim.   i want you to remember that ash and paul have been through quite a lot of experiences with you.  i know they walk different paths pursuing their dreams, but it's important to watch over them both, as you all go into the future.   watch over us.  what do you mean.   remember i said when every ..   course, i remember.  something will be born.   does that mean you're talking about ash, paul, and chimchar, too.   that's right, dawn.  and so now, what do you think you and paul have discovered through the two of you meeting and working with chimchar, ash.       oy vey.  yipes.    trapped.   carnivine.   carnivine, great. at ease.  everything copacetic.  par excellence.  although it appears our location is lousily littered with the law.   guess we'll just have to cool our heels until the heat simmers down a degree.   hmm.  we'll see.  ooohhhhh.  the ruins.      star.  staravia.   i don't know why, but i'm scared.   scared.   what is this new world team galactic keeps talking about.  and what are they trying to do.   i'll say this, whatever it is, i'm fairly certain it will mean nothing but disaster for all of us.   i think you're right.   although we don't know what their new world is, it's obvious they don't like this one.  of course, they're not the kind of criminals who are ever going to give up without a fight.  we saw now that team galactic's managed to steal the adamant orb they're going after the lustrous orb with a vengeance.   i'll just bet you they're really targeting dialga and palkia through the orbs.  ]  that's just what i think as well.  team galactic has big plans for those two orbs something that will affect the world of people and pokemon.  a challenge like none before.   just look.  how could they have done this.    we can't just sit here when they're stuff to do.   now ash, calm down.   hey, look out the window.   huh.  it's staravia.     star.  star star star staravia.   wow, you found team rocket back there.  : people who spent $100 a week at the leading nationalsupermarkets ..  ..could have saved $110 in just two months byshopping at walmart.  imagine the special gifts you can buy your familywith the savings.  save money. live better.walmart.   i guess we should be grateful that the fresco's still here.    who's there.   come out, or i'll be forced to come over there and bring you out.   hmm.  you pointy heads just don't know when to quit, do you.  .   team rocket, is it not.   smarty pants.   although looting the lustrous orb proves our pants are much smarter.     bronz.   g2 here.  we're moving in now.   it can't be.  we're going to the research center.   maybe.  either that or to the ruins.  garchomp.  fly on ahead and make sure team rocket stays put.   gar.   pikachu, i want you to go with garchomp, okay.   pika.   be careful.   piplup, pip.  piplup.   star.   piplup, you too.   it looks like piplup wants to help.   'kay, then we'll be counting on you as well.   piplup.   staravia.   dawn: and piplup, stay calm.   what.  whatwhat.  .   how do you do that.   easy.  you've got what we want and we don't stop until we get what we want.   huh.   we've known exactly where the lustrous orb was the whole time.  and to be totally honest, your efforts ended up saving us a lot of trouble by bringing it here in the first place.   the nerve.  the insult of being used by sharp dressers.   with weird haircuts.   purugly, use body slam.  and bronzor, use hypnosis.   wait, we need our bodies.   bronz.     purugly, no.   staravia.   piplup.   pika.   it's garchomp.   thanks to the champion.   you can't do that to my pokemon.   this scene reeks of twerps.   but that could mean one thing.   we're under the pikachu protection plan.   wobbuffet.     team galactic.   carolina, and cyrus too.   i would say you showed up not a moment too soon.   plan please.   that lustrous orb's our ace in the hole.  so let's stick to it like glue and lam outta this joint.   wow, on point.   to prove it's not word of mouth, focus your eyes on the lustrous prize.  ]  one wrong move, and this lustrous treasure turns into lunch.   and i sincerely doubt lustrous lasagna is gonna do you yoyos any good.   we win.  just like i knew we would.   wobba wobba wah.   cynthia, what are we going to do now.   they're so desperate, they just might go through with it.    don't you realize how important the lustrous orb is.  idiots.     hmm.   you.  look behind you.  i trust you fools know that the adamant and lustrous orbs bring great power to dialga and palkia.  but it is when the orbs are combined together with the three lake guardians that their full power emerges.  to put it in simple terms even you can understand the three guardians, plus the two orbs will gloriously bring forth nothing less than legends.    did he just say, "bring forth legends".   hmm.   cyrus, calm down.   don't you see, if we don't make them understand what's happening, they'll do something foolish like shatter the orb.  i refuse to let that happen at all costs.  i'm sorry if i seem so upset, but when the stakes are this high, our strongest weapon is the truth.  now listen well, the adamant orb is in fact dialga and the lustrous orb is palkia.  the orbs will bring them to this world.     pika. pika.   listen up, pikachu, use thunderbolt.   pika chuuuu.   all right, piplup, use bubble beam.   pip lup lup lup.   garchomp, dragon claw, let's go.       skuntank.  skunt.   hey, no fair.   we stole that thing.   only one steal per orb.   look, ash, the orb.   who's that pokemon.   skuntank.   the heartbreak of blasting off.   wobbuffet.  ]   skunt.   well done, my dear skuntank.  g3, backup plan a success.   oh, no.  ..   come on, let's move.     huh.  cyrus.   that ungrateful team galactic.  nobody treats me like bilge water and gets away with it.  no, sir.   i still can't help but wonder if what that stuffed shirt was ..  about the dual orbs bringing forth dialga and palkia.  big mouth.   maybe that wacko's got his eye on getting into the legendcatching business.   good point.   but even if you do manage to get your paws on those double dynamos, how'd you handle 'em both once you got ahold of 'em.   carolina: it's painfully obvious that team galactic knows a lot more about dialga and palkia than we do.  what could they be after, knowing they stole the veilstone city meteorite as well.   i wish i had been more help.   no.   i stunk. i blew it bad.     no, no, all of you were absolutely great.  you've got to remember that.  excuse me.   huh.  cynthia, is something wrong.   huh. no.  we need to comng) the tar monster scared the locals  when he gets nervous.  rorry.  hidi reah.  they're insisting that thes demands.  y inc. is currently investigating    you're gonna have a scooby s   mystery incorporated.   cynthia: so, ash, where are you all heading next.   the hearthome gym.  and remember, i'm rooting for you.   wow.  thanks a lot, cynthia.   uh, cynthia, we've just now received confirmation from the office concerning related scheduling for all the upcoming title battles.   so the next challenger has been decided.   right.   next challenger.   the next challenger for the title of champion.  could be tricky getting back to regular living after all this.   regular living.   i think i know just what you mean.   team galactic must be dealt with.  but it's important for you to live full lives and keep working to realize all your hopes and dreams.  i thank you all so very much.  ..   right.   narrator:with their evil plans to steal both orbs a success, team galactic's quest is underway, and the difficult to comprehend appearance of two legends of the sinnoh region appear to be slowly but surely becoming a reality.   greetings, cyrus.  although we did get the lustrous orb, i realize there's no excuse for everything that went wrong.   not a good reflection on you.     as for the lake guardians, it appears there have been more recent sightings of both mesprit and azelf.     preparations have been made to bring forth all three.  and as for capturing them, you're in charge, jupiter.  i will then call on the pokemon hunter at once.   cyrus, the ironworks now confirms the experiments with the veilstone meteorite were successful.  they are commencing with the initial phase of project red chain.   the birth of a pure, new world is soon to be upon us all.  dialga. palkia.  bring forth your awesome power.  n: my whole world changed one day when all these random cards
