 kiss .  all right, piplup, use hydro pump .  piplu...  glameow .  that's brilliant.  immediately responding to zoey's call.  use fake out .  pip.  piplup .  piplup, no .  nicely done, zoey.   and glameow nails fake out, leaving piplup unable to use its move.  piplup .  that's fake out .  fake out is a priority move that always makes its target flinch, and it's because of fake out that piplup wasn't able to use hydro pump.  that move is an absolute must.  learn it now, meowth. do .  we'll render pikachu's thunderbolt null and void.  not that easy, if you haven't heard.  gallade, use vacuum wave on togekiss.  gallade .  togekiss, use air slash .  toge .  it dodged that .  kiss .  gallade .  that togekiss is surprisingly agile.  amazing.  and since my pokmon can't fly, tricky as well.  gallade and togekiss' moves have been judged even.  both sides have elegantly dodged their opponent's attack.  all right then, dawn, now it's my turn.  gallade, use signal beam and, glameow, iron tail .  gallade .  meow .  what's she planning this time .   another new collaboration move .  spun by glameow's iron tail, the colorful signal beam grows even larger and is giving off an even more beautiful glow.  by using iron tail's power, zoey's succeeded in bringing out signal beam's sparkle even more.  she's making the most out of glameow's tail.  you're not the only one with a spinning move, zoey.  piplup, whirlpool .  piplup .  blast it, glameow .  meow .  piplup, do it .  piplup .  and, togekiss, aura sphere .  toge .  incredible .  whirlpool and aura sphere have combined into a powerful move.  this is an offense and defense move you'll see only in a double battle .  and again, their moves are judged even.  wow, they both lost the same amount of points.  yeah, but remember, zoey got a huge lead right from the start.  and because of that lead, zoey's still ahead.  no need to worry.  dawn's just getting started.  she's got plenty of time to turn it around.  gallade, use swords dance .  gallade.  gallade .  gallade powered up.  two can play at that game.  now, togekiss, use safeguard .  toge .   and safeguard surrounds togekiss.  that soft sparkle is truly mesmerizing.   safeguard and togekiss' elegance are earning points in dawn's favor .  so why did dawn use safeguard right now .  probably worried about statuschanging moves.  i think they're both trying to feel out each other's next move.  now, glameow, shadow claw .  meow .   wow .  watch the sparks when shadow claw hits the stage floor.  a ghosttype move has no effect on togekiss because it's also a normaltype, so what's zoey trying to do .  maybe zoey's trying to confuse dawn by purposefully using an ineffective ghosttype move.  all right, togekiss, sky attack.  kiss .  right where i want you, dawn.  now, gallade, use psycho cut.  gallade.  i knew that was coming.  now, piplup, use peck on gallade .  piplup .  i'm afraid that dawn's fallen into zoey's trap by focusing all her attention on gallade .  gallade .  piplup .  gallade .  where's togekiss .   glameow's jumped on togekiss' back and is refusing to get off.  no way . piplup .  zoey did that on purpose .  it's obvious to me zoey's strategy was to show off psycho cut and shadow claw in a flashy manner, which ended up grabbing dawn's attention while taking her attention off of togekiss.  a coordinator has to be able to command two pokmon at all times during a double battle, which means the strategy of distracting your opponent can end up being really effective.  and it's a strategy you'd only find in a double battle, too.  it's an advanced technique that requires coordinator and pokmon to be in perfect sync, or it won't work.  zoey's something.  dawn, togekiss, you can do it .  hang in there .  togekiss has completely forgotten it's a performance.  when it comes to elegance, togekiss' performances are in a league of their own, but with battle experience, togekiss comes up a bit short.  glameow, use thunderbolt .  meow .  togekiss .   safeguard has been activated.  it was used earlier, but it's surprisingly protecting togekiss now.  glameow's thunderbolt may bemagnifique, but togekiss' safeguard protecting togekiss in such a powerful way ismagnifiqueas well .  "incroyable" .  yeah, piplup, let's give togekiss a hand .  piplup.  oh, no you don't .  go, gallade .  gallade .  gallade .  piplup, go on through .  pip, pip, pip, pip, piplup .  xt turns on the adventures... .  it's the sky racers dare devilracing team and the sky racers carrieris where it all happens .  you can turn the pilots toraise the elevator  and rotate the runway.  sky racers twister...  tornado prop  tiger shark and twin eagle.  can you launch the buoys .  avoid the flares... then race to the finish line .   . imaginext turnson the adventures... .  yeah . yeah .  nice flying, ace .  imaginext sky racers carriertcomes as shown.  other planes sold separately.  use vacuum wave .  gallade .  dodge it .  piplup .  piplup . gallade .   piplup is flying through the air.  piplup, use hydro pump.  piplup .  kiss . piplup .  way to go .   togekiss is free again, thanks to piplup .  wow.  who would've thought dawn would show off piplup's moves in such a natural way .  gallade, use psycho cut .  gallade .  piplup .  you're on a roll, you two, so keep it up .  pikachu .  zoey, i think the real battle begins now.   what a stream of beautiful offensive and defensive moves, worthy of the final stage of the grand festival.  so who will win the honor of top coordinator .  zoey or dawn .  piplup, piplup .  gallade, separate piplup and togekiss by using psycho cut.  gallade .  gallade .  dodge it .  kiss . piplup .  piplup .  oh, no .  quick, piplup, use whirlpool and, togekiss, help piplup out .  piplup .  kiss .  i see you're distracting me, too, huh .  piplup .  gallade .  glameow, use iron tail .  meow .   incredible .  glameow's tail has caught piplup's whirlpool .  what happened .  obviously zoey's trained really hard and gotten really good at using glameow's tail.   amazing how zoey can show off such an imaginative move using iron tail.  elegant .  now, gallade, use vacuum wave.  gallade .   gallade's vacuum wave bursts the whirlpool and beautifully showers gallade and glameow.  we are not going to lose .  piplup, use peck.  togekiss, sky attack.  toge .  piplup .  piplup .  pip .  togekiss' sky attack and piplup's peck have combined to create a move with unbelievably explosive power .  oh .  that move's as powerful as can be .   dawn and zoey's points are neck and neck, and with 20 seconds left on the clock, who knows who will win this battle .  yes, she's caught up to zoey . pika .  if dawn can nail one final move, she'll be the winner .  gallade, use psycho cut and, glameow, thunderbolt .  gallade .  gallade . )
