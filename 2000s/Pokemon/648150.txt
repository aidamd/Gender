 ly worth working on.  but so far i've been a little short on some good ideas.  okay, then why not try having mamoswine use ice shard first .  let's see...  those rocks are a good target.  okay.  got that, mamoswine .  mamo.  use ice shard .  mamoswine .  wow, that was nice, dawn .  using ice shard is a great idea.  thanks, candice.  now, for the next move.  they're both working hard.  this is how rivals should be .  with zoey lending a hand, dawn should be able to come up with some great ideas.  huh .  candice, shouldn't you head back to the snowpoint gym soon .  no, it's fine.  besides i can't leave now when those two are all kiai'd up like this.  right.  yeah, of course.  may i see mamoswine's and your other pokmon's combinations .  so i can see how effective they'll be in battle...  sure.  mamo.  pip, piplup.  piplup, bubblebeam, let's go .  piplup, lup, lup.  all right, mamoswine, use ice shard.  mamo .  piplup .  piplup .  pikachu, use iron tail .  pika . piplup .  what's with the early hubbub .  twerpettes.  and one of them is sunglassestopped.   looks like twerpettetraining time to me.  piplup, are you all right .  piplup...  freezing your pokmon's partner is not the best contest move.  so what do i do .  why not try something like this .  abomasnow .  abomasnow .  now if you don't mind, dawn and mamoswine, watch closely.  mamo .  abomasnow and i going to show you a variation on ice shard.  uh... okay.  ice shard, go.  abomasnow .  now, razor leaf.  mamo.  wow... amazing .  see .  you won't freeze up your pokmon's partner that way.  let me try.  sure, go for it, dawn.  abomasnow.  all hail gym leaders.  be a fan on your own time,capisce .  let's make our stylish entrance, steal some pokmon, then flee.  shut your twin yaps and leave me be.  no talking in class.  piplup .  piplup, it's break time.  ready, pachirisu .  mamoswine, you saw that.  the trick is to shatter the ice shard with your tusks and then make it swirl around pachirisu.  mamo.  and, pachirisu, you use discharge when the ice shard is surrounding you.  mamo .  mamoswine, use ice shard .  mamo, mamo...  swine .  yes.  fingers crossed.  pachirisu, discharge .  gorgeous .  man, dawn's on a roll now.  pika .  quick, pachirisu, smash those rocks.  now how is that going to work .  it's a good idea, but there's no way it's going to reach those rocks from above.  oh, no .  pachirisu .  i wouldn't exactly call that a battleworthy move.  and i was so sure it would work.  don't beat yourself up.  it'll make an awesome move for the performance round.  man .  that double battle will be here soon and i'm all out of ideas.  maybe i should just quit while i'm ahead.  hey, don't even go there.  i know what.  how about having a double battle against me .  even though i don't have a clue which move to use .  you haven't tried your other pokmon.  like your new pokmon, cyndaquil.  daquil .  you don't have to worry about cyndaquil being up for it.  yeah, but fireand icetype pokmon aren't compatible.  aren't compatible .  sometimes certain things you'd never think would go together end up going togetherreally well.  hold on a minute.  now that i think about it, zoey's shellos and glameow'scombination moves aren't compatiblewith each other either.  but they work togetherperfectly.  double battle sounds great.  you'll help me, zoey .  sure.  give me a second.  come on, sundae.   .  kids: ronald.  .  wooooahhhh.  . ba da ba ba ba .  ronald. i'm okay.  tony.  athletes  frosted flakes.  .  . we are tigers .  crunchy flakes perfectly coated with sweet ..  makes them a great tasting part of a nutritious breakfast.  . mighty, mighty tigers .  .  kellogg's frosted flakesare more than good.  ..  grrrrreat.  .  i wonder which pokmon zoey's gonna use.  i would think she'd use glameow for sure, so it's a toss between shellos and misdreavus, if you ask me.  we'll see about that.  i doubt very much that she's doing this battle just for dawn.  zo zo's always thinking about the big picture.  i'm definitely going to stick to this battle like glue.  what about showing the sunglassestopped twerpette what for .  you wanna start a fan club for her .  leafeon, kirlia.  ready .  go .  you've got a new pokmon .  wow .  awesome  leafeon, the verdant pokmon.  leafeon is always surrounded by fresh, clean air because it uses photosynthesis just like a plant.  kirlia, the emotion pokmon.  kirlia is able to sense the feelings of its trainer, and when it becomes happy, it will start to dance.  the two of them and i are training really hard.  hopefully they'll have their debut at the grand festival.  cyndaquil.  mamo, mamo.  so ready, zoey .  yeah .  mamoswine, use ice shard.  mamo .  mamo, mamo.  swine .  cyndaquil, now use flame wheel.  cyndaquil.  cyndaquil .  quil .  quil .  quil .  quil, cynda .  the shattered ice shard had to have melted from cyndaquil's heat.  well, that's not gonna work.  pika.  don't worry, dawn.  even if it didn't work, combining fireand icetype moves is a great idea.  now's the perfect time to take a moment and try to visualize the move you wanna use.  visualize the move.  it's cold but it's hot.  it's sweet but it's spicy.  hot and spicy.  sweet ice cream.  cyndaquil, use flame wheel and stay put.  cynda.  daquil .  okay, mamoswine, after the shattered ice shard surrounds cyndaquil, go ahead and freeze it once again.  mamo .  now, ice shard .  mamo .  swine .  cynda .  use ice shard one more time.  mamoswine .  daquil .  it worked .  and it was that spicy tamato berry ice cream bar that inspired me.  i'm calling the move "flame ice."  that's nice .  the ice is sparkling from the rotating flames.  yeah, what a pretty move.  pika.  dawn, that's amazing .  all right, cyndaquil, attack leafeon and kirlia now.  mamo...  and it was so close.  a little longer and it could've been the finishing move for the double battle.  cynda .  leafeon, kirlia, magical leaf.  mamo .  kirlia, psychic, let's go .  mamo .  cynda .  mamoswine, cyndaquil .  mamo...  that's it, battle off .  mamoswine, you all right .  cyndaquil.  cyndaquil...  hey, jessie, where are you toddling off to .  what's causing your boot heels to be wandering .  a day without messing with twerpettes is like a day without sunshine.  i wouldn't dream of doing anything to sabotage such talented maidens as they.  strange.  she looks like jess.  yeah, but that's a whole new load of hooey.  i'm kidding.  but i now know how to win a double battle.  all i have to do is combine two totally different pokmon's moves.  yanmega, use silver wind.  yan, yan .  yipes .  incoming fire .  wobbuffet, take the reins.  wobbuffet .  well, you messed that up .   and we're blasting off again .  mamoswine and cyndaquil, great work.  cynda. mamo.  dawn, you were great, too.  wow, zoey, thanks.  that's what true rivals are all about.  your kiai is strong.  thanks.  once you master your flame ice, i'm sure it'll be a brilliant double battle move.  thanks, zoey.  i'm definitely going to master it before the daybreak contest.  and before you know it, that fifth contest ribbon will be all mine .   all right .  and, pikachu, let's work real hard and win our eighth badge, 'kay .  pikachu.  they say necessity is the mother of invtion, and dawn's brandnew moveproves it, as she confidently headsinto the daybreak contest.  so for all of our heroes,the journey continues.  captioned bysoundwriters  ahh. jackpot.  ha.  these cards are just what i'm lookin' for.  heh heh heh.  man on radio: we've got reports of a suspicious person out by the impound lot.  looks likeunderground dueler might be trying to get his deck back.  unit fiveniner en route.  looks like our "suspicious person's" got some style.  i've never seen a duel runner like this, before,

like the bridge, yusei.  did you know that it was once going to connect the satellite with new domino city.  so why was it never finished.  hmm. i'm glad you asked.  you see, if the construction of this bridge was ever completed, it would have given the evil that lives deep beneath the satellite access to my precious new domino city.  and the battle that is ab reach these shores.  but what about the people in the satellite.  they will become enveloped in eternal darkness unless someone can save them.  so why aren't you using the power you possess to get them out of there.  i can't do that.  but why.  because as long as the people in the satellite remain there, the darkness will stay as well.  but why would you put the people of the satellite at risk.  yusei, the time has come for me to tell you the truth.  this runner's gonna look sweet in my garage" looks like sector security is earlier than usual.  time to make my exit.  hmm.  but i don't think the air vents are gonna work this
