world .  the rarest.  it's so hard to find good sunflora help these days.  we're not discussing labor issues, we're talking about that plethora of lum berries .  oh, i knew that.  now let me see here, lum berries.  aha .  the lum berry, a berry that can heal any status condition .  cornering the market on those babies would heal our doughless condition .  and with our fortune, we could rustle us up a rabblerousing robot .  time to get into the black market lum berry business .   yes .  wobbuffet .   piplup, piplup, piplup...   marill, marill, marill...  piplup . marill .  pip, pip, piplup .  amazing how piplup's trying to impress marill .  you're right .  pip, pip, pip...  piplup .  huh .  flora .  it's okay, sunflora.  the workday is over, so why don't you go ahead and relax now.  sunflora .  sun .  the coast is clear .  okay, jessie and james, get crawling .  creepy crawlers once more.  harks me back to our team rocket academy training days .  all these luscious lum berries and we, too .  ooh .   pseudo sunflora can help as well.  but i'm playin' my role to the hilt .  by standin' guard, i'll lull those twerps into a false state of security .  i'll lull you with my fist .  okay, fine.  though violence ain't gonna solve any of your issues.  mar... mar...  mar, mar, mar, mar.  piplup .  lup.  lup .  marill, marill, marill, mar, mar, marill .  piplup .  piplup .  marill, marill .  ah, we're bursting with berries .  there's such beauty in bulging bags .  there won't be a robot we can't buy .  marill, marill .  lup .  flora, flora, flora, flora, sunflora...  marill .  pip... lup, lup, lup .   piplup .  marill .  piplup .  marill .   pip, pip, pip, piplup, pip...  they're a public nuisance .  piplup .  the way i hear it, piplup and elekid are squawkin' if we don't let marill go, we'll be sorry .  it appears there's a twopokmon lovefest for marill goin' on .  piplup.  mar . oh, how sweet.  there's nothing more romantic than a pokmon love triangle, now is there .  lup .  haste makes waste .  you don't want marilleepoo to get hurt .  i'd watch my "p"s and "q"s if i were you so as to make sure this circular cutie doesn't run into a streak of bad luck .  and this dynamic duo is in the bag .  piplup, elekid, and marill makes three .   arrivederci .  where's piplup .   piplup, piplup .  piplup, piplup .   three sides do make up a triangle, but a pokmon love triangle makes math fun .  so who will be the lucky suitor who gets to whisk this lovely little darling away .  and who will be left brokenhearted shedding tons of tears .  love is my favorite game, because only one can win the pain prize .  and nothing is more fun than another's pain .   maybe the poor girl ingested a bum lum berry.  hey, piplup, are you in here .  oh, no, dawn, marill has disappeared .  my piplup is missing as well, lulu .  what's up . piplup is missing .  so is marill .  piplup's missing .  and marill, too .   marill, marill .  hey, piplup .  where are you guys .  pika, pika . marill .  marill, where are you .  hey, this lum berry has been picked .  i think you're right .  but who could've done this .  it's possible that whoever picked that lum berry might have made off with piplup and marill as well.  okay, staraptor and gliscor, i choose you .  staraptor . gliscor .  go and look around for piplup and marill .  gliscor .  gliscor . star .  never
