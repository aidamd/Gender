pachirisu's electrictype moves against a groundtype like gabite won't really be able to do much of anything.  guess you're right, brock.  the only thing that might get in there is super fang .  pip, piplup .  gabite, use dragon claw .  ga... ga .  chira .  spin and dodge it .  pa .  hathere's no escaping gabite's incredible speed .  chira .  super fang, let's go .  chira .  use aerial ace .

.  no way pachirisu's gonna be able to show any appeal in thislast round.  looks like the appeal isgabite's and gabite's alone.  sweet kiss, now .  use aerial ace .  i've gotta stay calm.  there's still time .  pika, pika .  the judges evaluate pachirisu on grace as well.  dawn's just gonna have to count on that.  maybe, but they're not gonna get many points if they can't do any damage .   less than two minutes remaining.  i don't even need half that, 'cause this battle's almost over .  use stone edge .  ga... ga .  discharge .  chira...  chira .  awesome .  you're really warming up now .  it's about time dawn started runnin' the show out there .   she should realize the aqua ribbon isn't a toy.  gabite, dragon rage .  ga .  gabite .  quick, spark .  pa .  dragon claw .   what's this .  pachirisu stopped dragon claw using its tail .  i've never seen anything so brave and courageous .  truly amazing .  way to go .  that's showing 'em, pachirisu .  pachirisu can do that because it stores discharge's energy in its tail .  pachirisu's really on .   30 seconds left on the clock .  stone edge, let's go .  ga... ga .  ga .  quick, get your tail up .  chira .  yeah, now that's what
