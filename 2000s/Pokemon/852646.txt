 now, rock tomb .  piplup .  they're using rock tomb as a shield .  that move's got no chance against a watertype attack.  all right, buizel, use aqua jet .  bui.  smog, let's go .  oh, no .  bui.  mag .  buizel .  that rock tomb was for keeping buizel from seeing what magmortar was up to .  he's switching now .  ursaring, stand by for battle .   button pushers unite .  buizel, use water gun now .  ursaring, hammer arm .  how did it counter buizel's water gun .  now bulk up .  ursaring just raised its offense and defense .  ah, who cares .  buizel, aqua jet .  ursaring, slash .  ursaring's attacks are a lot more powerful after using bulk up first.  focus blast .  spin, buizel, use aqua jet .  so tell me, paul, how'd you like a taste of our little counter shield .  pikachu's not the only one who can use it.  buizel, sonicboom .  ursaring, hammer arm .  buizel, return .  bui...  bui...  i got you .  aqua jet .  focus blast .  buizel .   buizel is unable to battle and the winner is ursaring .  poor buizel. lup.  all right, buizel, return .  thanks, buizel, now you take a good rest.  buizel was eliminated because of ash's poor judgment.  you're saying ash should've had buizel return the time before .  ..  .. buhbye.  ..  look out. ha ha.  ..  you'll want to chase that taste down.  kids love me. you.  up and away.  ..  see you there, lollygagger.  ..  that's always... both: the winnamon.  the cinnamontastic partof a nutritious breakfast.  kids: awwww.  so little time,so many bowls.  l       we do the chocolate, we do the chocolate    we do the chocolate dance    oh yeah    we do the chocolate, we do the chocolate    we do the chocolate dance    chchch, just shake your nesquik    chchchchocolate, chocolate dance    chchchchocolate, just shake your nesquik    chchchchocolate     aox raptor, i choose you .  staraptor .  staraptor, use aerial ace .  star .  ursaring, counter with hammer arm .  star .  staraptor .  focus blast .  star .  star, star, star...  staraptor .  close combat .  staraptor .  ursaring, use slash .  star .  hammer arm, let's go .  staraptor, no .  star...  staraptor is unable to battle and the winner is ursaring .  staraptor, return .  thanks a lot, staraptor.  get some rest.  electabuzz, stand by for battle .  okay, if it's electabuzz, then, chimchar, i choose you .  chimchar .  yeah, chimmy's at the plate .  chimchar'll be great .  a fiery chimchar challenge, i can hardly wait .   information update .  phew.  chimchar .  here we go, flamethrower .  chimchar .  protect .  now, light screen .  huh, another defensive move .  another switcheroo .  these buttons are killing me .  i need a finger massage .  whoa, electabuzz first used protect and then light screen on top of that.  right.  i'm certain paul's strategy all along was to first use protect to cover electabuzz and then light screen to cover his next pokmon.  torterra... stand by for battle .  terra .  paul knows we have the advantage but he's still using torterra.  okay, use flame wheel .  chimchar .  stone edge, now .  dodge it .  torterra .  change up .  changed direction .  the ability to control stone edge is just incredible .  flamethrower, go .  chimchar .  oh, man .  light screen halved the damage from that flamethrower.  chimchar has an advantage as a firetype, but this is getting difficult now.  on top of that, there's the danger of getting hit with stone edge if chimchar gets too close, leaving both ash and chimchar with precious few options.  chimchar, return for now .  hey, make up your mind .  the challenge of manual labor.  press on .   gliscor, take over .  gli .  of course, i know that torterra's protected with light screen, but torterra also took a lot of damage.  i'll finish it off in one shot.  xscissor .  gliscor .  frenzy plant .  terra .  gliscor .  gliscor . pika .  gliscor...  gliscor is unable to battle .  the winner is torterra .  gliscor, return, now .  now you get a good rest.  thanks .  torterra was paul's first pokmon.  man, is torterra strong .  pika, pika .  that's great, pikachu, but electrictype moves won't work .  pika, pika.  okay, then everything's on your speed and your iron tail .  pikachu .  pikachu .  i'm counting on you, pikachu .  what theswitching again .  ursaring... standby for battle .  fickleminded twerps are by far the worst twerps of all .  wobbu .  man, they're not letting up for a second .  paul's pokmon know whatthey're supposed to do and they're doing itdown to the letter .  so that's gotta bepaul's battle style.  pika, pi .  this is mine .  pikachu, quick attack .  pika .  use hammer arm .  pikachu . lup .  pikachu .  yes, good one .  now use iron tail .  quick, focus blast .  what the...  is that what i think .  right, that's pikachu's static ability.  static can cause your opponent to become paralyzed when using a move that makes direct physical contact, so now it looks like pikachu's got the upper hand.  pika .  pika .  pikachu still has the burn effect from flame body .  lup .  finally .  look out .  pi... pika...  now hammer arm .  it's coming . thunderbolt, go .  pikachu .  where's that power coming from .  it hasn't even used bulk up .  pika .  pikachu .  pikachu . piplup .  ursaring's guts ability has been activated .  its attack stat is boosted when affected by things like paralysis, poison, and other status effects as well.  i'll bet you paul was just waiting for that ability to get activated all along.  pikachu.  pikachu, are you all right .  pika, pi.   pikachu is unable to battle .  the winner is ursaring .  no way .  even pikachu got pummeled.  ursaring's got brute to burn.  thanks, pikachu.  you battled really hard.  pika, pika.  you sit back and watch and i'll nail it this time.  pika.  i've got one pokmon left, while paul's still got five .  but paul's pokmon have all taken damage.  it's not over yet .  we can still do this .  up to you, chimchar.  pika, pika.  chimchar .  it's going to be really tough to beat all five of paul's pokmon with just chimchar.  new danimals coolision.  dylan. two danimals flavors at once.  yea, you could do that.  or try new danimals coolision tubes.  coolision tubes.  yep,

wow, our chimmy's a champ .  that pokmon's second to none .  it's that kind of inspiration that gives hard work a good name.  wobbu .   thanks, chimchar, you rocked.  so let's keep this going.  let's turn it around .   pika.  chimchar's evolving .  monferno .  that's great .  you evolved into monferno .  monferno .  lup .   monferno, the playful pokmon, and the evolved form of chimchar.  it controls its flaming tail to keep its opponent at an ideal distance when battling.  amazing .  chimchar's answered ash's call and gained new power in order to rise to the challenge.  the trust between ash and his pokmon is being demonstrated right before our eyes.  mon...  monferno .  wow, monferno, you learned mach punch and that's a brandnew move .  mon, monferno .  electabuzz, stand by for battle .  chimchar wasn't really compatible with paul's training style, but with ash's training style, it's a perfect fit.  simple as that.  just as some pokmon have compatibility issues, there can be the same issues between pokmon and trainer and chimchar's evolution is a great example.  it's not a matter of right or wrong.  this battle has both ash and paul's pride on the line.  that's why this battle will make both trainers and pokmon much stronger in the long run.  hey, that's why you wanted a full battle.  mmhmm.  all right, monferno, use mach punch .  mon... ferno .  all right . pika .  wow .  monferno's super fast, piplup .  lup .  thunder .  ferno .  monferno, hang in there .  use flame wheel now .  monferno .  use protect .  now flamethrower from up there .  monferno .  thunde monferno, dig .  monferno .  now flame wheel .  monferno .  thunder .  use flamethrower .  monferno .  keep it up, monferno .  pika .  all paul can do right now is defend.  you're right.  ash got his momentum back because of monferno's unbelievable speed .  mach punch, go .  protect .  thunder .  monferno, no .  quickly switching gears between protect and an attack shows how impressive paul's electabuzz is .  monferno...  monferno, are you all right .  hold on.  monferno, use flamethrower now .  i knew it, it's paralyzed .  it can be an added effect of thunder .  how could it happen now .  huh .  monferno .  oh, no, is that blaze .  that's not blaze.  it's monferno's determination not to be beaten manifesting in its flame.  that's right, monferno, we're not gonna give up, no matter what .  all right, monferno, mach punch .  electabuzz, thunderpunch .  mon...  pika.  monferno .  monferno is unable to battle and the winner is electabuzz .  which means that the victor is paul .  oh, no.  mon...  monferno, thank you.  monferno.   that was a spectacular battle, you two.  many thanks .  yeah, it sure was.  it's been a while since i've seen that look on your face.  i'll send you my pokmon.  got it, paul.  oh, ash.  and so, with their pride on the line, ash and paul's full battle hasended with a victory for paul.  but from here, what does the futurehold for ash and paul and the sinnoh league .  the answersas we continue.         hey, i smell something terrific.   i smell somethingbaking terrific.  ooh.  jon is baking pies.  no bread.  no cake.   no pies.  oh. bread and

water's so peaceful in this little cove.  you know, guys, catching fish isn't the important part.  it's the peace and the serenity and just being out in nature that matters.   garfield: fishermen always say that when they've been out three hours and haven't caught so much as a sardine.   jon: i don't care if i catch a fish.  it doesn't matter to me one bit if i catch   a fish.  i've got a fish on my line.  i did it. i did it.   garfield: jon did it.  jon did it.  alert the media.   odie:   jon:  hey.  there he is.  ohhhh, he's a beaut.   garfield: he's an hors d'oeuvre.   jon: there we go.

with this worm.  mama. mama. )
