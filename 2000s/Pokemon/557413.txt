  ambipom.   swinub.     pikachu.   char.   bwee bweeeee.   awesome, but scary.   now that's exactly the way you do it.  you use everything you've got to send their attacks right back at 'em.   what a pleasure it is to see such strong and healthy growth.   a good trim is worth it's weight in gold, you know.   you're in good hands with our hands.   wobbuffet.   will you stop babbling and finish up.   tactless twerp.  never appreciates our trouble and toil.   forget about that sourpuss.  twerp money is still money that'll buy us a scheme or two.   cold cash from a crank is better than no cash in the bank.    hmm.   ash: let's go.   hmm.   turtwig.   gli gli, gli gli.   piip lup lup lup.   buneary.   ambipom.   swinub.     pikachu.   chimchar.   bweee.     everyone okay.  ash.   we're fine.  you call those attacks.  it was nothing.   using your own moves to defend against your opponent is a good strategy, but ash, you've got to hold some moves back or else you'll have nothing left.   yeah, we've also got a lot of work to do on our timing.  'kay, let's do it again.    huh.  paul, i thought you were already headed out of here.   happiny.  happ happ happiny.  happiny.   if you've got something you wanna say to me, say it.   to tell the truth, your style of training is pretty interesting.   huh.   i was wondering why you asked ash about chimchar before.   hmm.   i'm starting to think ash is getting to you.   i can't believe he won't use blaze, that's all.   that's just ash.  it's how he operates.  you see, ash is trying to develop his own battling style.  i talked to reggie when we were in veilstone city.   huh.   he told me you were training hard and trying to come up with your own style of battling.  is that true.  that brother of mine's got a big mouth.   he worries about you, you know.  but i was a little surprised when he told me he had challenged his way around a lot of regions and gyms.  let's see, i think he was missing the battle frontier brave symbol, right.   yeah, that's the one.  there he was, winning symbol after symbol, until he loses one battle and gives it all up, just like that.  he should have been bitter, but no.  instead, he was always smiling, always happy.  i'll never understand it.  i'm not reggie.  i won't do what he did.  and i will not make the same pathetic mistakes.  huh.    everyone okay.   pikachu.   awesome, ash.  you really took it to a new level this time.   you mean, they took it up to a new level.   huh.   ash: paul.       now there's a sight.  twerp against twerp on offense and defense.   all that's missing is a program guide.   waaah bah.   you're doing the exact same thing as me when you train.   no way, paul.  how's this just like you.   you're having other pokemon attack you so you boost your pokemon's moves.  how is that any different.   he's training for his rematch at the hearthome gym.   so you're going to battle at the hearthome gym.   right.  hey, you battled there, didn't ya, paul.   hmm.  sure did.  and obviously, i won.   okay, i did challenge fantina and her ghost type pokemon before, but she kept hittin' us with hypnosis, and i couldn't do a thing about it.  that is, until next time.   so now you think this time's the charm.  all you have to do is keep hammering away, and all her ghosttype pokemon will fall over.   i'll win it.  i happen to have faith in my pokemon.  and they've got faith in me, too.  this time's different.   you're pathetic.   all right, we'll just show you have we've got.  let's have a battle.   all you had to say is you were using chimchar's blaze.  that would have been enough.   i already told you.  i don't mess around with blaze.   all right, then.  but only one pokemon per side.  that should be quite enough.   okay. fine with me.   pika.   bwee bwee.   turtwig turtwig.   hey, turtwig, what's going on.   turtwig.   i get it.  you wanna get in there, too.   turtwig's saying there's no reason the other pokemon need to knock themselves out before their gym battle.   aw, how magnanimous of the little green goober.   it's you, turtwig.   turt.   now, honchkrow, stand by for battle.   honchkrow.   flying type.   pokedex:honchkrow, the big boss pokemon, and the evolved form of murkrow.  honchkrow recruits many murkrow to travel with it, and it spends much of its time at home preening its feathers.   sounds like quite a pokemon to me.   pika.   thing is, turtwig's a grass type, so honchkrow will be a challenge.  ash will have his hands full.   turtwig, when it comes to pure speed, nobody can touch you.  so let's use that to our advantage and win this battle.   twig.   all right, honchkrow, use sky attack.   honchkrow.   quick, turtwig, energy ball.   turtwig.   this is great.  sky attack takes some time to charge up.  turtwig will land first.   honchkrow.   like that did anything at all.  go, honchkrow.   honch.   heads up, turtwig.   turtwig. turtwig.  turt.   awesome.   even against honchkrow, turtwig's amazing speed can't be beat.   piplup.   pika.   use night slash.   dodge it, and use razor leaf.   turtwig.  twig.     pika.   you're going too easy.  stop dodging.   come on, you can do it.   twig.   use aerial ace.   honch.   now, turtwig, use bite.  let's go.   use aerial ace, one more time.   honchkrow.   turtwig, get up.   honch.  krow.     can you still keep battling.   turtwig.   uh, what's going on.   could it be.   turtwig's starting to evolve.   star.   huh.   ahh.   grotle.  we need to comng) the tar monster scared the locals  : oohhooho  you're gonna have  forhis so we headed over to walmartfor their great selection ..  ...all that was left

allow light to shine on the tree on its shell.   wow.  turtwig finally evolved.  great.   piplup.   yeah.  all right, grotle, i think it's time for us to mix it up.   use aerial ace.   honch.   perfect.  now let's give them a little taste of some of your new power by dodging and then using energy ball.   grotle.    honchkrow.    ]  i guess honchkrow's fast after all.   you're right.  but it's more than that.   sky attack, let's go.   honchkrow.   grotle.   now's your chance, grotle, so use bite.   grotle.   oh, no.   go boom.     what's wrong, grotle.   come on, honchkrow, get going.   honch.   grotle, you gotta turn around.   honchkrow.   hey, come on, grotle.  you're super fast.  you should be able to dodge that.   a pathetic trainer and his equally pathetic pokemon.   what was that.   grotle.   all right, so where's that faith.  if you really think you can win with faith alone, then you're no better than any lowlife loser trainer out there because you have no idea how grotle's changed.  honchkrow, dark pulse.   honchkrow.     grotle, no.   grotle.   grotle, hang in there.      ash, tell me if i'm wrong, but i thought pokemon were supposed to get stronger when they evolved.  so then, what happened to all of turtwig's speed.   hmm.  its body did get heavier.   huh.   when turtwig evolves into grotle, its body gets 10 times heavier and all in a very short time.  so even if grotle wants to move quickly, its body is just not able to follow along.  ]  oh, man.    frenzy plant, let's go.   tor terra.   wee.  weavile.   terra.   your reaction's too slow.   tor.   wee. wee.  weavile.   all right.  that was more like it.   tor.   what's the matter with you.   terra.   stop.  why don't you just let it be.   grotle, in case you didn't know, i thought it was the coolest thing ever that you evolved in the middle of our battle.  it just felt like nothing could keep us from winning, you know.  it's like when you got hit with that intense dark pulse, and you didn't even budge one bit.  man, you just stood there and took the whole thing.  i'm sorry i didn't tell you to attack when i should have.  of course you're feeling a little offright now since you just evolved.  i know that.   pikachu.   but your power's way up, and once your speed is too, no one will be able to touch you.   grotle.   i don't think grotle feels so well.   piplup.   don't forget, grotle, we're in this together.   grotle.     .  hmm.  chimchar.   grotle.   pika.   grotle.   chim chimchar.   pika pikachu.   pip.   pika. pika pika.  pika pi. pikachu.   pip.   gliscor.   grotle grotle.  grotle.      talk about burning the midnight oil.   now that grotle's king size, it's on a training mission to get its speed up to speed.   everything did get crazy when it evolved.  you know how twerps can slow you down.   waaah bah.     pikachu.   grotle.   gli.      torterra.   pika.   star star.   pip pip.   aah.   aaaah.   piplup, what's wrong.   hey, what the where is everybody.   pip lup.   huh.   pika.   tor.   grotle.   chim chimchar.   terra.  tor. terra.   gly.   staravia.  ]  dawn: a torterra.   ash: it's gotta be paul's.   gliscor.   whoa. here comes steel wing.   gliscor.   terra.   wow, it absorbed it.   gliscor.   tor.   rigid.  like you, james.   hmm.   look at that.  torterra can't dodge a thing.   no, it can dodge.  it just doesn't want to.   huh.   it's choosing to stand there and take it.   stand there. but what for.   scor.  scor.     scor.  gliscor.   terra.   grotle.  ]  gli.  gliscor.   terra.   gli.  scor.   torterra was just waiting for the perfect moment to attack.  just like when piplup uses bide.   lup.   and also like a heavyweight boxer.   terra.   grotle.   torterra.   gli.   twerp alert.   char.   pika pika pika.   yeah, i just saw the whole thing.  and i know what torterra was up to, too.  thanks, torterra.  you were giving grotle some serious pointers on how to battle.  isn't that right.   terra.   i know exactly what you were talking about.  first, to take your opponents attacks, and when the time is right, whamo.   terra.  terra.   grotle.   tor.   using itself as an example was a great way to teach.  turtwig may have lost some speed when it evolved, but the truth is grotle's power more than makes up for it by a long shot.   yeah.  grotle, you have your very own battle style, and my job as a trainer is to help make it the best it can be.   grotle.   sorry i got kinda crazed.  it's my fault for not knowin' it.  so, from here on out, we're gonna work together to build your battle style from the ground up.   grotle.   so let us wisely take a lesson from the grotle playbook.   team rocket has its own style, dark though it may be.   and not worrying what other wise guys are doing makes a whole lotta sense to me.   waaah bah.   tor.   you're certainly a curious one.   torterra.   hey, paul.   hmm.   last night was really something.  we wanted to thank torterra for everything it did.   i had nothing to do with what torterra did.   what's wrong with you, paul.   piplup.   well, chimchar, guess you can't judge a pokemon by its trainer, don't ya think.  next time we battle paul, we're gonna win it.  i promise.   grotle.   first you've got the hearthome gym to deal with.   and i know you're gonna do just great.   piplup.   thanks.  it's about time we win our fifth badge.  and i can't wait.   pika pika.   narrator:a confident trainer and his newlyevolved grotle look to a bright future, while at long last, ash's hearthome gym rematch draws near.  and as for paul, well, you'll just have to stay tuned and see.y whole world changed one day when all these random cards started raining down everywhere.  at first they seemed harmless enough so a bunch of us kids invented this cool new game...
