 having made it this far in the competition has been a complete surprise to me.  luckily i have my music to soothe the day's cares.   what a relief .  and here i thought i was the only one who couldn't get to sleep.  hi, zoey.  nando, here's to a great show tomorrow.  thanks.  and the same goes for you, dawn.  you know, i can't help but wonder what dawn's opponent is doing right about now.  this is all genuine jessilina memorabilia .  of course.  who wouldn't want a piece of jessilina superstar, tiptop coordinator .   those cards with your mug on 'em blew the lid right off of this joint, and this stuff's gonna put us in serious moola orbit.  top coordinator...  i like it .  stardom... in demand...  the first fashionistain the land.  a legend in my own mindand perfectly timed.  final stage, make me your latest rage.  i can see a brilliant future forming in our midst.  two more battles and the big coordinator buck stops here.  wobbuffet .    the morning finds a stadium filled with a flurry of fans.  welcome to the event where dreams can either be made or dashed, the exciting grand festival semifinals.   bon matin.  now, to all the many coordinators, amazing pokmon and loyal fans alike, let's cheer .  excitement is here .  merci, merci.  here in the semifinals, coordinators will compete in twoontwo double battles.  and the object is to be able to strip away points from their opponents with beautiful moves within five minutes.  so now it's time for the first battle of the day.  on my left, it's zoey.  and on my right, it's nando .  we will soon learn which one of them will be advancing on to the final stage.  five minutes on the clock.  and begin .  mismagius, leafeon, once again it's curtain, go .  mismagius .  wow, so zoey's misdreavus evolved.  i'll bet you nando's going to go with either a bugtype or a grasstype.  yeah, and i bet you they'll be pokmon that can use the move sing, you know .  piplup .  kricketune and lopunny, please.  i need your help .  lopunny .  lopunny .   lopunny's not a bugtype or a grasstype, and it can't use sing either.  leafeon, use energy ball.  and mismagius, thunder wave .  mismagius .   and there's a quick fusion move .  the energy ball has fused with the thunder wave .  that's awesome . pika .  even the movements before they launched that move looked impressive.  leafeon and mismagius are gorgeous.  piplup .  tres jolie .  and if that move hits its mark, it meansbeaucoup depoints .  all right, lopunny, use jump kick and kricketune, use bug buzz .  lopunny .   and the fusion move is kicked in the air .  man, the way he used zoey's energy ball against her.  really.  amazing power and control all around .  lopunny is using the streamers created by the bug buzz like beautiful scarves to wrap around itself, and the fans are in complete awe.  dancing .  that's novel.  and nando scores some serious points with lopunny's stunning dance.  incredible .  what a fantastic way of showing off lopunny.  nando is treating the fans to a performance that's a real feast for all the senses.  lopunny are well known for having amazing springlike jumping abilities.  nando's idea to match that ability with kricketune's music to make lopunny look like a ballerina makes for a magical performance.   a gifted dancer and a gifted musician.  check it out.   another nando masterpiece.   look out .  the thunder energy ball is roaring straight down .  the nowexploded energy ball is making lopunny sparkle with beautiful colors .  magnifique .  nando even made use of zoey's fusion move.  i've never seen zoey under pressure like this.  piplup. pika.  nando's sure tough.  he's using his gym battle experience while he shows off all those beautiful moves.  but i've got a few beautiful moves of my own to show off.  mismagius, leafeon, double team go .  mismagius . leaf .  mismagius . leaf .   it's a double double team .  and they've arranged themselves one after another with precision .  oh, my.  such contrast is stunning.   zoey's using her pokmon in perfect sync, while really highlighting the fact that it's a double battle.  but so far, nando's calling the shots.  which's how it will end if this keeps up.  all right, lopunny, blizzard .  lopunny .  okay, here it comes, right .   lopunny is eliminating the doubles with blizzard .  but zoey's using the light from the disappearing doubles to cause her actual pokmon to glow.  spectacular .  such a thrill is tres belle .  gorgeous.  i'll tell you, both nando and zoey are incredible.  pika .  double team was just a trick to lure nando into doing what zoey wanted.  zoey knew that disappearing doubles give off light, and she then wisely used it to her own advantage, wow.  kricketune, use sing .   there it is .  nando's greatest move, sing .  i knew nando was gonna use sing.  mismagius, use lucky chant .  mismagius...  mismagius... mismagius... mismagius...  what's lucky chant .  lucky chant is a move that prevents your opponent from landing any critical hits for a limited amount of time.  but i wonder how that's going to help against sing .  what's that . i'll tell you.  back in the quarterfinals when i learned we'd be battling, i knew who i was going to use, my mismagius .  because i also knew using mismagius' lucky chant would counter your move sing.  this battle is like no other .  it's singing, battling, chanting, so unique .  i think zoey's starting to turn it around.  so she trained to use lucky chant specifically against nando's best attack.  what great strategy.  pika .  how exciting .  lucky chant defeats sing .  "incroyable" .  clever.  zoey has once again used my strategy against me.  time to liven things up.  leafeon, leaf blade .  quick, lopunny, use focus blast .  lopunny .   and it's a huge hit .  leafeon uses its body to make a double leaf blade .  kricketune, use xscissor against leafeon .  mismagius, use psywave against kricketune, go .  mismagius .  lopunny, help out .  lopunny .  use leaf blade again.  you've got to take on that xscissor .   neither side is giving an inch .  and the crowd is mesmerized as they watch this actionpacked duel.  man, do i wish this battle could go on forever.  forever .  the attacks, the defense and the elegance of it all.  i could never do what they're doing.  it's the way they control their own pokmon while using their opponent's pokmons' moves to their advantage .  they're both excellent.  either one of them could make it to the finals.   we're at the 30second mark .  it's beautiful.  and to see moves like this in a contest battle is amazing, really .  kricketune, silver wind, and lopunny, use blizzard .   and now it's collaboration between silver wind and blizzard .  as the stage is illuminated with a gorgeous light, kricketune and lopunny look absolutely aweinspiring .  my turn, now .  leafeon, aerial ace, and mismagius, use psywave .  mismagi .  leaf .  leaf .  oh, my .   and mismagius' psywave gives leafeon beautiful wings of light .  oh, my, my, my .  i've never seen such a sight .  she's using psychic powers to the max, mismagius' power and leafeon's beauty in perfect balance together.  it's the ultimate fusion move .  i'm tele...porting.  me swirled charms.  marshmallow power teleport.  oh. ahh.  swirled lucky charms, part of a good breakfast.  they're magically delicious.  is yogurt.   oooh.   three to four hours later.  but now, it's frozen.  want it.  ahhh.  and the sticks change color.   wow wee.   you can freeze your trix yogurt with four color changing sticks.  now it's twice as awesome. yum.  what incredible beauty.  lopunny, intercept it .  all right, mismagius, use thunder wave .  kricketune, use xscissor .   time's up .  and the winner of this amazing semifinal battle is...  it's zoey .
