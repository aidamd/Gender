how did all your training with raichu work out.   see, the problem was no confidence at all.  but all our hard work will pay off in today's battle.  you'll see.   if you're gonna beat someone, it won't be us.   ha ha, we'll see.  see you later.   huh.   you three are slow as molasses.  . watch.   hey, no ya don't, ash.   now we have to make sure those two don't beat us.   hmm, the only thing i'm thinking about is making grimer shine like a star.   good. that's the spirit.   professor rowan.   they're the perfect example of trainers who don't get along that well at first, but who end up as formidable rivals.  and that's what i love so much about this school.   listen, is that the sound of success i hear.   it's speaking to me loud and clear.  it all comes down to .  no goal.  hungry for
