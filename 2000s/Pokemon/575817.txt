right after we make a nice, soft, comfy bed for it .  all right, ambipom, come on out .  ambipom .  give everybody a hand .  great, this should do the trick .  hey, mamoswine .  would you mind moving over there, please .  we made a nice bed for you.  come on, you can do it .  mamo...  yeah, great .  awesome, mamoswine, just like that .  thanks a lot, everybody .  just a little further, mamoswine.  all right, good job, mamoswine .  you did it .  now, let's cover mamoswine up with branches so nobody can see a thing .  mamo...  mamoswine, are you in pain . .  when a pokmon gets sick, you've got to stay calm .  they can pick up on a trainer's anxiety, and in the end, it only makes things a lot worse.  no need to worry, mamoswine.  you see, brock taught me everything i need to know about giving first aid.  yeah, i'll make sure you get all better .  no need to worry .  mamo .  yes, here it is .  this is just what we need .  you see .  this plant has medicinal qualities that ease the pain from a pokmon's wound .  it's the amazing gellike substance in the plant that does the trick.  okay, gang.  i need you to go find thisplant .  piplup .  buneary .  hope that's not too tight.  now, piplup, can you use whirlpool for me .  piplup.  piplup .  too big, piplup .  a little bit smaller than that .  lup .  now, buneary, use ice beam .  buneary.  okay, that should be good .  all right, then, so what's next .  i rememberwe should get an oran berry .  the problem is this soil is just too dry for them...  so we have to find moist soil.  look at 'em all .  give me a hand, ambipom .  ambipom .  ambi... ambipom .  ambipom, can you go get that fruit over there, too .  we can feed it to mamoswine once it's feeling nice and healthy.  look, i brought you an oran berry.  now, eat it all up.  you're going to feel great .  mamo...  oh, man, dawn sure can disappear .  where is she .  pika .  pika, pi, pika, pika.  whoa, that's a pokball .  hey, i think it belongs to dawn .  dawn wouldn't just drop a pokball like that, so something must've happened .  you're right .   it's the ongoing drama of the disappearing twerpette.   come on, we've gotta hide .   but she and that behemoth brute must have touched down locally.   well, i'm seeing zip.   aggron .  that aggravating aggron's close by .  well, we're rapidly approaching sundown .  we need to find us an aggronfree shelter.  freethinking...  i think that behemoth tree just might fit the bill very nicely.  if we scale its hospitable heights, we'll be out of everyone's sights .  this is bad .  ambipom, do you think you could scare team rocket off .  ambipom .  then up we go for a long forest nap .  i think aggron must be a mind reader .  i predict we leave .   retreat .  wow, that was amazing .  thanks a lot, ambipom .  okay, it's back in your pokballs you go, gang .  huh, what's wrong .  i get it.  you're all worried about mamoswine, too .  you're awesome.   agg... huh .  aggron .  wow, thanks a lot, pachirisu .  oh, man, i hope they're okay.  we'll look for them again once the sun comes up.  right, brock.  i'm pretty sure that lost pokball belongs to mamoswine, and since it's empty, that must mean mamoswine's out there somewhere as well.  i just hope they're all doing all right.  you can't sleep, either, can you .  since the ice is all melted, i had a thought.  how about another ice beam .  buneary .  perfectthanks, buneary .  yes, the irresistible honey for honey nut cheerios will finally be mine.  not if i can help it, yellow jacket.  i'll get that honey yeeeeeeeeeeeet.   the honey is safe this time...  ...for honey nut cheerios.  part of this good breakfast.  star .  gliscor...  hello, dawn . hey, dawn .  pika, pika .  you know, there's nothing like a monstersized machine to make bright my day.  yay .  our gigagolem's gonna make succotash outta that aggron .  agg... ron .  aggron's got good timing .  a bully like that is always looking for a fight.  yeah, well, that's one bully who's about to see the world from both sides .  agg...  ron .  boulder holder, fire . with ire .  ron .  oh, here comes double edge .  mamoswine uncovered .  if she can hide that, she can hide anything .  stopyou leave my mamoswine alone .  demands require a position of power.  which our missiles will demonstrate. can't wait .  stop it, can't you see mamoswine's hurt .  staraptor .  star, star .   huh .   did you find dawn .  staraptor, staraptor .  let's go .   twerpette mamoswine, target .   boulder holder, away .  mamo .  mamoswine, is your leg okay .  mamo .  it's dawn and all her pokmon .  you guys all right .  we're fine, ash and brock .  mamo .  looks like the medicine worked, mamoswine .  mamo .  was mamoswine hurt .  and what's team rocket doing here .  one twerpette's bad enough, but now the whole everloving twerp litter's here .  so let's rumble .  ready to go, pikachu . pika, pikachu.  yanmega, use steel wing .  now use ancientpower .  quick, use thunderbolt .   we're fools .  we had a chance when the twerpette was touring solo .  i told you, when you start small, you stay small .  whoever coined the phrase "easy does it" didn't have twerps making it difficult to do anything except the following.   we're blasting off again .  agg .  so now we gotta deal with that aggron .  mamoswine, do you want us all to battle together .  mamo .  hmm... all right, mamoswine, let's go .  mamo .  hit with your tusks, mamoswine .  mamo .  aggron .  now, mamoswine, use ice shard .  mamo... swine mamoswine's doing what dawn's saying to do . who knew .  all right, keep it up, mamoswine .  now use ancientpower .  mamoswine .  guess aggron's had enough.  it's about time .  you did it, mamoswine, yes .   way to go, dawn .  you and mamoswine are quite a team.  thanks, guys, no need to worry.  you know, brock, i remembered all the firstaid techniques you taught me and tried them out with mamoswine, and, wow, did they work .  piplup and the whole gang helped me out, too .  here you gosee, your pokball.  pikachu found it for you.  to think this whole mess happened because i lost it.  thank you so much, pikachu .  pika, pika .  now all we have to do is get through this forest. right .  oh, yeah .  maybe now that mamoswine's feeling better, it'll want some of that fruit.  mamoswine .  the more things change, the more they stay the same.  at least no need to worry about storing leftovers.   some harrowing times indd, but dawn has a trusted partnerand friend in mamoswine.  with a team like that,other coordinators beware, as the journey continues.  captioned bysoundwriters d:      odie:   garfield:  " check.   jon:   garfield:  ]  jon:  ugh.   garfield: "eating jon's lunch " check.
