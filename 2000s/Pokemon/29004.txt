  wailmer, the ball whale pokmon.  it spouts water out of its nose and becomes lethargic when its body becomes dry.  "when its body becomes dry." hey, that's it .  let's get some water on wailmer, and that'll do the trick .  whoa, that worked like a charm .  lux.  but what in the world's a wailmer doing way down here .  pika.  i wonder if this has something to do with all those wailord now.  did you get separated from the group up in the harbor, wailmer .  luxio, lux, lux.  whismur, whis .  luxio must be leading the wailmer back to where the rest of its buddies are.  great, come on, let's go finish what we started and help 'em out, pikachu .  pikachu . bui, bui .  happiny.  not even happiny can open

knew you could do it .  mamo, mamo .   dawn, no .  if there were ever a need for me to worry, i'd say this is it .  happiny .   zubat and mothim .  teddiursa, too .  venonat, rattata, nidoran .  who would've thought pokmon were living down here .  luxio .  i get the feeling you're their leader, right .  lux, luxio, lux .  so that totally explains why you would wanna help out the wailmer that

listen carefully, 'kay .  first, the spheal will use their ice beam and freeze the canal all the way up to the top.   pika, pikachu.  we're gonna make a big slide .  next, we'll make a sled using the furniture we borrowed from the teddiursa .  pika, pikachu.  then, buizel and the spheal will push the sled with all their might while wailmer's riding on top .   spheal .  and once the sled really gets moving, it's pikachu and luxio's turn .  you two'll unleash a couple of powerful iron tails on the sled so it really starts moving, and then the sled'll have enough speed to shoot up the ice slide right along with wailmer.  and then wailmer will reach the top .  so, are we good, everybody .  cool, so let's do this .   nice .  now that's one frozen slide .  we're all ready to roll .  so on to the last step .  all right, pikachu and luxio, you two ready .  pika . luxio .  okay, buizel and spheal, push wailmer as hard as you can .  all right, now keep it up just like that, but give it more power .  pikachu and luxio, iron tail .  luxio .  yes .  pika . lux .  ahh .  veno, veno, venonat, veno, venonat .  veno .  yeah .  i knew it would work, we did it .  yeah .  things got a little bit hairy for awhile, didn't they .  pika.  there's the exit down there .  pip, piplup, piplup .  come on, piplup, that's enough.  i'm exhausted .  dawn and brock .  it is ash .  pip, piplup, piplup, piplup .  okay, piplup, i deserve that.  and thank you .  lup.  what taste gets athletes  frosted flakes.  .  . we are tigers .  crunchy flakes perfectly coated with sweet ..  makes them a great tasting part of a nutritious breakfast.  . mighty, mighty tigers .  .  kellogg's frosted flakesare more than good.  ..  grrrrreat.  .         swim into mcdonald's for a "barbie in a mermaid tale" toy, now in your happy meal.           the most important part of a mcdonald's happy mealis you.     ) huhokay, now i get it.  so luxio stole the pokmon food for the wailmer .  wow, i'll bet the wailord hanging out in the harbor are wondering what happened.  everything's going to be all right since the exit is just up ahead .  hey . whoa .  what was that for .  luxio's using electrical pulses from its claws to try and tell us something.  is there something going on we need to be concerned about .   swam...  swampert .  swampert .  a swampert .   swampert, the mud fish pokmon.  swampert is a powerful pokmon that can drag even a large ship, as well as inflict critical damage to its enemies with one blow.  swam .  whoa, you were trying to warn us that we're in the middle of swampert's territory, weren't you, luxio .  lux .  swampert, hold on .  we didn't come down here to mess around with your territory .  swam .  guess we've got no other choice but to use thunderbolt, bigtime .  pika...  don't do it, ash, swampert is a groundtype .  electrictype attacks won't do a thing .  you're rightback off, pikachu .  grotle, i choose you .  grotle . swampert .  that was great, grotle .  now use razor leaf .  grotle .  swampert...  sorry about that, swampert .  oh, finally .  it's great to be outside again .  go on, wailmer .  yeah, you go on and join your friends now.  it's going to be just fine.   i... can't believe it .  it evolved into a wailord .  it can't fit under the bridge .  i'm sure that's a drawbridge, so the span is able to lift up.  quick, we've got to get into the control room .  pikachu.  can you move it . no.  i'm afraid we can't get the bridge to move if we don't have a key .  go, pikachu .   what are you doing .  pikachu .  that's crazy . it moved .  yeah, but we still don't have enough power.  oh, no, not againswampert .  brock and dawn, take care of things here .  i'll stop swampert .  swampert, don't do it .   lux .  now, pachirisu, help us .  good, just a little more .  swampert, swampert .  it won't make it in time .  luxluxio .  now that's what i call real power .  it opened .  wailord, get moving .  swampert, swampert.  swamp...  yeah, great .  pika, pika .   wow, it's beautiful .   piplup.  maybe that's their way of thanking us for helping them .  yeah. pika, pika.  luxio, i'm never gonna forget any of you guys as long as i live .  luxio.  hey, you're welcome if that's a "thank you." well, guess we can get back on the road now.  right .  but my stomach's saying we ought to take a little break at the pokmon center, you know .  when it comes to ash's stomach, missing lunch is a nono .  noi mean, yeah .    no matter what size or shape, our heroes will help anypokmon they can, in this case, leaving a grateful wailord, luxio and many friends in their wake .  but after lunch, it's on to dawn's next sinnoh contest challenge .  captioned bysoundwriters      jon: do you guys mind if i stop at the market and buy a few things.   garfield: mind.  as long as they're edible, why should we mind.  i think i'll take a nap while odie sticks his head out the window and lets his tongue flap in the breeze.   odie:   garfield: hey, for a dog, that's heavyweight intellectual activity.   dream about some edible things.   jon: boy, it's a beautiful night a clear sky and all those stars.  it's the kind of night that makes you wonder if there are people out there.   garfield:   jon: people on other worlds or from other times visiting us.    i'll be home in 90 nanoseconds, miriam.     uh, cheese puffs.  i got you a 500year supply of those just 300 years ago.     all right, all right.  i'll pick up some before i get home.  i'm going to have to stop off at earth in the 21st century.       okay, okay.  i'll get you a jelly doughnut, too.    odie:   jon: you'll have to wait just outside the door, odie.  garfield, are you coming.   garfield: i can't answer you.  in addition to the fact that i can't talk, i'm also asleep.   jon: we'll be back soon.   okay, a 500year supply of cheese puffs and a jelly doughnut.  i guess that's a balanced diet.   garfield:   huh. spider.  i know what you're thinking.  it's just a little, harmless spider, not hurting anyone.  and you're right, of course.  so you know what i'm gonna do.  i'm gonna swat that spider.  i've got you now.  now i've got you.  now. okay, this time for sure.   okay, thenthistime.   okay, this is it, spider.  you're toast.  you're an exspider.  you're gonna be flatter than one of jon's souffls.     garfield:   yow.        garfield:   oh, my. where am i.  and why do i have the feeling i really don't want to know.   jon. odie.  anybody i know.  i'll even settle for nermal.  hello, somebody.  i don't know where i am, but i have the feeling they like cheese here.  ah, at last someone i know.  hey, squeak.      garfield: boy, you aresonot squeak.     garfield: sorry, i just remembered to make an appointment to not be here now.   or here.   i don't suppose

this is great.  this isnotgreat.     garfield: oh, no ketchup.      garfield: oh, no lettuce and tomato.     garfield: hey, would you please hold the onion.       garfield: thank you.     i think this sandwich had better be to go.    garfield:  unh.  one of these must start it or turn on the cd player or something.        i don't like hairy sandwiches anyway.   garfield: there must be some instructions in here somewhere on how to fly this thing.  ah, an instruction manual.  i'm saved. i'm saved. i'm saved.  okay, "how to steer craft see " page 19, page ah, here it is, page 19.
