 there's no way piplup could have gotten that far.  hey, gible, will you help us look, too .  gib .  gible .  gib, gib, gib, gib...  gib, gib .  rhy .  rhyperior .  rhyperior .  'kay, what's a rhyperior doing around here .   rhyperior.  the drill pokmon, and the evolved form of rhydon.  rhyperior can hurl rocks at its enemies by tightening its arm muscles and launching them from the holes in its palms.  we've got to get moving and find piplup.  gible, stop biting and let's get moving, come on .  so it sounds to me like you were looking to split the scene.  right, piplup, pally .  piplup, piplup.  piplup, piplup.  piplup says it was planning on heading back to professor rowan's lab.  some walk.  do you know how far away that is .  you could be nursing a million heartaches and you'd still be walking .  why split in the first place .  lup, piplup, piplup.  piplup says even though it was minding its own business and not doing anything wrong, gible kept popping it on the head with draco meteor over and over.  ouch .  piplup, pipl .  and even with all those bops to the bean, piplup's trainer didn't even warn gible once not to do it, and gible's trainer didn't even get angry either, not a single time .  piplup, piplup.  when piplup finally piped up and said something to gible, all it got was the cold shoulder .  lup.  everyone was sticking up for gible, and nobody cared about poor piplup's feelings one bit.  oh, the agony .  there's nothing quite as painful as when no one cares about your feelings.  this piplup's a victim of total and complete trainertopokmon neglect .  so making the long journey to professor rowan's lab seemed your only option.  and since our home office often doesn't even know who we are, we know just how you feel.   poor piplup. lup .  no need for tears.  from now on we'll be your family.  piplup, piplup...  all right, meowth and piplup, wait here .  there's a little talk that needs to be talked .  piplup .  i'll be bonding with my buddy here and working on good pokmon etiquette .  it's time we teach those clueless twerps a lesson in manners for the sake of themselves and their pokmon.  right .  pokmon appreciation 101 will soon be in session.  well, did you see piplup .  star.  okay, staraptor, return .  i wonder if piplup's angry 'cause gible's draco meteor kept on hitting it from the sky the way it did.  yeah, it did happen more than once.   may we have a word with you .   uh, who are you .  check the id and you'll see we're members of the pokmon rescue corps.  pokmon rescue corps, you're right.  so what exactly does your corps do .  our stated mission is to help out troubled pokmon in need.  and it just so happens that recently we were asked by a certain troubled pokmon for our assistance.  a pokmon who was betrayed by its trainer and her friends.  "and who's the trainer ." you ask .  it was you .  and you .  our client emotionally stated that the pokmon called gible kept hitting it with a draco meteor square on its head .  and in spite of this shabby treatment, neither of you trainers scolded gible for being so uncaring.  and furthermore, no one seemed to worry one bit about the victim named piplup.   victim .  do you have any idea how that can emotionally injure a pokmon for life .  the dear is devastated .  oh, no .  don't you people know a whit about pokmon and their care .  the fact is a pokmon is much more of a delicate creature than you think .  hey, we already knew that, come on...   afraid not.  if you truly did know it, you wouldn't have acted that way .  a pokmon's pain is its trainer's pain.  and a pokmon's grief is its trainer's grief.   welcome to the basic relationship between pokmon and trainer .  but we feel the same way as you.  no . wrong answer .  you made your very own pokmon so sad that it ran away .  it did .  sad but true.  we found the poor dear crying its little eyes out and actually attempting to make the journey to professor rowan's laboratory on foot .  no rescue corps worth its weight in honor could stand to see poor piplup treated like dirt.  when we gave assistance we heard its tale and decided to give you a piece of our angry minds.  so because it is eversoclear you don't know the first thing about the care and feeding of pokmon, we insist you participate in our special sensitivity class.  right .  and we'll take good care of your pokmon while you're attending said class.  not that you would know anything about that .   now, if you will leave us your pokballs.  what do you think .  guess we've got no choice.   rhyperior .  rhy...  pika .  i guess we got separated from that rescue corps.  do you really think what they were saying is true .  if so, we owe piplup a big apology.  hey, wait, where'd pikachu go .  no .  not pikachu, too .  rhyperior's got issues .  fear not, we laid out your case.  and told them exactly of your feelings and fears.  piplup.  piplup says it doesn't know if it can ever thank you enough.  you don't have to thank us .  see, rescuing is what a rescue corps is supposed to do and we love what we do .  lup .  but if gratefulness is grabbing at you, we do have just a few weensy things we would love to ask your dear pal pikachu .  there may be some concerns on little pikachu's mind as well, of course.  true .  after all you can't help too many pokmon, right .  don't you think .  lup, piplup .  piplup says, "leave it to the master ." piplup .   see you soon, good buddy .  how easy to handle can these simpleminded twerp pokmon be .  very.  pika, pi .   piplup . pika .  pip, piplup .  pikachu .  pika, pika .  pip, piplup .  pip, piplup .  piplup .  pika .  attention, all pokmon who crave a consultation, step right this way .  pip, piplup .  pika. piplup, piplup.  piplup. pika.  piplup. pika, pikachu.  pikachu .  you should know by now that we'd be prepared for that .  come on, piplup, please tell us where you are .  you too, pikachu .  now where could those two be .  gible.  gible.  no way.  yes way .  i'll bet you that draco meteor found piplup .   of course .  pikachu .  and piplup .  pika, pi . piplup .   twerpa mia .  what do you know, it's the pokmon rescue corps .  hey, what's going on here .   what's going on is certainly not you .  when it comes to disguises, you haven't a clue .  on the wind . past the stars .  your brains're goo .  bringing chaos at a breakneck pace .  dashing hope, putting fear in its place .  when the moon is full, we're haunting your dreams.  we fool you each time with the simplest of schemes.  jessie . and it's james .  meowth, that's a name .  putting the dogooders in their place.  we're team rocket.   and we're in your face .  rhy .   pikachu .   piplup .  pip, piplup .  oh, piplup .  piplup.  piplup, you're all right .  lup... piplup.  pip, piplup .  oh, piplup .  piplup, i'm sorry .  i was so worried about you .  piplup .  you're okay .  piplup, i'm sorry that gible's draco meteor kept on hitting you.  we'll be careful .  gib, gible .  hey, you're messing us up, rhyperior, so please take your shenanigans elsewhere .  rhy, rhyperior, rhy .  okay, rhyperior's going bonkers 'cause its trainer tossed it out on its head like they did .  all right, i should have known it was you .  yeah, pokmon rescue corps, my foot .  well, prepare to get stomped .  seviper .  seviper .  you stomp too, carnivine .  carnivine .  i said stomp, not chomp .  all right,

 piplup .  piplup .  wow, piplup just used a new move .  that was hydro pump .  such is life.  ah, to think luring pikachu with piplup might've put the pokmon rescue corps on the map.  perchance there's a team rocket rescue corps.  then no blastoffs.  dream on.   we're blasting off again .  rhy, rhy .  rhy, rhyperior, rhy .  you've gotta calm down, rhyperior .  please .  why are you so angry .  we don't wanna have a fight with you, really .   rhyperior .  there you are, finally .  i'm so sorry, rhyperior, i was wrong.  rhyperior...  please don't run off like that again, okay .  rhy.  hi there.  i sure hope my rhyperior didn't cause you any trouble.  no way .  no need to worry .  no trouble at all .  rhy, rhy, rhy, rhy, rhyperior...  i can't believe that rhyperior ran away from home.  it looks okay now, since they made up.  that's great .  piplup .  so from now on, let's stay together .  what do you say, piplup . piplup .  a misunderstanding between friends ultimately
