 ful.   gligar.   man, i don't want gligar to get spoiled.   on the other hand, treating gligar harshly isn't going to get you very far either, right.   yeah.   'kay, turtwig, come on out and give me a hand.   turtwig.   now, turtwig, energy ball.   twig.   gligar.   gligar, if you don't pay attention, you won't be able to dodge.   turtwig.   gli.   now, use steel wing right from where you are.   gli.    brock: huh.  ...  look out.  come on, gligar, not over here.   dawn: of course, now gligar can fly straight as an arrow.     your opponent's back over there.  aah.  what are you thinking.  you're gonna have to stop crying and start toughening up.  let's try it once more.   gligar.   gligar.   where are you going.   gligar.   best wear a helmet when gligar calls.    i just thought of the perfect way to utilize that head hugger.   i'm sensing a scene change.   it's a doozy.  imagine the boss is having the greatest dream of his bossy life.  but just as he's getting to the best part, the morning sun starts creeping in through the curtains.  and that's gligar's cue.  instantly keeping the dream alive is what gligar lives for.  after some quality face time you know what the boss'll say.  "i've gotta thank meowth and friends in a big way for helping me make sure the dream "  while our dreams begin.   all: . wishing and hoping .  . and plotting and dreaming .  . and scheming .  . and soon we'll be rich .   waaaah baaah.   gligar, where are you.   pika pika.   hey, gligar.   say something.   this is just great.  things don't go perfectly so gligar throws in the towel.   pika.   staravia.   huh.  staravia, did you find gligar.   star. staravia. star.    star.   pika.   huh.   it's the poetry guy's grandson.   hey, it'd be a lot easier if you used my name.   hey, gary.  why are you here.   i was just on my way over to lake valor to check out that legendary pokemon you guys saw.   i'll never forget that.   so, does that mean professor rowan sent you.   yeah.  hey, what's up with this gligar.   it's mine.  we were just doing some special training.   let me guess.  in the middle of your training, gligar took off.   gary, how did you know that.   just call it a good guess.  seems your training method leaves a little bit to be desired, ashy boy.   what was that.   hey, i'm just offering you my help.   thanks, but no thanks.  come on, gligar, let's try it once more.   gli.   sounds like a "no, thank you" to me.   oh, yeah.  come on.   maybe you should take gary up on his offer to help.   yeah, just do it for gligar.  it might be best for everybody.   yeah.  at have you got to lose.     pika pi.   umbreon.   it's gligar against umbreon.  we'll be able to show you a few things.   we won't go easy on ya.  now, gligar, steel wing.   gli.   umbreon, shadow ball.   umby.   gli.   i get it.  gligar freaks out easily when facing an opponent.   but gligar, you wanna get strong.   gligar.   even though gligar wants to get strong, as soon as any battling begins, this huge wave of uncontrollable fear takes over.   all right, so the first thing we have to work on is getting over that fear.   but how do you do that.   you focus in and concentrate.   ash, i guess you'll never change.  the most important thing about working with steel wing is to jump as high as you can.  so, if we can master that, no doubt gligar will have lots more confidence in battle.   that's great.  gary sure gives instructions much better than ash.   i heard that.   but how does gligar increase its jumping power.   by using the end of gligar's tail like a spring when it takes off.   awesome.  'kay, gligar, use the end of your tail like a spring when you jump.   gli.   now, steel wing, go.   gli.  gli gli gli.   what a jump.        pika pi.   oh, no.   now gligar has gotta deal with a fear of heights.   we've got a problem, all right.  how much battling has gligar done.   not much.  gligar got beaten pretty badly battling a gliscor.  maybe that's why gligar's so scared now.   yeah, makes sense.   a gliscor.  hey, i know.  we'll evolve gligar.   huh.   what's that.   piplup.   it's a razor fang.   right.  we'll just evolve gligar into gliscor with this.  and once we do that, all sorts of gligar's abilities will improve, and we can put the brakes on all of that fear.   wow. thanks, gary.   gli.   calm down, gligar.  evolving is no substitute for some honest hard work.  you can evolve after you conquer your fear.       what the.   jessie: a clueless twerp is certainly nothing new.   james: you're all pros at not having a clue.   face the facts.   for a change.   stinks to be you.   we'll bring chaos at a breakneck pace.   we'll dash all hope and put fear in its place.   it's old home week for the twerps, we see.   but without us, you're short by three.   jessie.   and james.   meowth makes it triple, you see.   putting you dogooders in your place.   we're team rocket.   in your face.   wobbuffet.  wabba.   team rocket.   don't you guys ever get tired of being lame.   silence.   check out our gliscor bot.   gliscor.   aah.   gligar.   gligar.   now that's a tail with some real torque.   meowth: and you're a dork.   stop it right now.  gligar's staying with me.   we don't need the extra ballast.   brat.  always dragging us down.   i'll fix you.  staravia, stop team rocket.   staravia.   spare me.  seviper, use haze.  and yanmega, use silver wind.   seviper.  seviper.   star.      they're gone.   and with gligar and ash.  strawberry shortcakemini notebooks with scented stampers.  one in your mcdonald'shappy meal.  . ba da ba ba ba .  .  i can't see anything, ronald.  hey,you're right.  i know what to do.   wow.  . ba da ba ba ba .   gligar, you're not hurt, are you.   gli.   everyone should have a gliscor bot.   we do, and that's what counts.  which leads to the need to speed gligar by delibird express to the boss's digs.   once the boss is dreaming without morning interruption, we'll be rolling fat.   mmhmm.   waaaa baaa.   so, to mark today's victory, i've taken the liberty of preparing a modest little meal, and here it is.  canned food with eight layers of cans.   there's nothing modest about a towering pile of tin.   quick, eat before we pass the expiration date.   all: peel that tin and let's dig in.     we haven't found ash and gligar yet, and the sun is starting to go down.   i know this terrain like the back of my hand.  and there just aren't that many places around here where team rocket's balloon could have touched down.  this way.   dawn: right behind you, gary.   piplup.   jessie: mission accomplished.  my needle's on full.   the only good tummy is a fully packed tummy.   great.  now we can get outta here.  quick, face the bars and then use xscissor.   gli.  gligar.   one more time.   gli.  gligar.     gli.
