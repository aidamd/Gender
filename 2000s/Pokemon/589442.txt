'cept i'm not sure what berry it is.   pikachu.   hey, wasn't it an oran berry.   that's it.  let's go find some.   pika pika.   i don't see a thing.   yeah, me neither.   there's nothing on this

i've got clean clothes.  you don't know how very basic essentials are until you have none.  . .  this is what gives us hope.   you, too, can help families affected by disaster by purchasing yellowcap

good flight.   scor.   to the right, to the right.     gliscor, oh no.   you've gotta calm down.   this place is amazing.  it's got everything i need and then some.  hmmm.     we need another blanket.   right.   pika.   that's great.  thanks pikachu and turtwig.     yes, sir. we are stocked.  one thing's for sure, we don't have to worry about medicine for a while.   gliscor.   gliscor.   gliscor.     gliscor.   wow, you're heavy.   scor.   you're ash's gliscor.  so, what's up.   gliscor gly.  gliscor gly.  gliscor gly.  ..   gly.   huh.  there's some sort of trouble.  right.   gliscor.   then we've gotta get home, and fast.   gly.     you alright.   gliscor.   i've forgotten you can't fly unless the wind is at your back.  okay, hop on my back.   gly.   just do it. quick.   scor.  gliscor.   hurry.   gly.  gliscor.   you're as heavy on my back as you are on my front.     gliscor.   maybe i should go on ahead.  see ya later.   gly.   we've got to do something to get pachirisu to eat, but what.   i don't know.   pika pika.   hmm.  when i was little, i remember my mom used to feed me mashed fruit whenever i got sick.   i'll tell ya, it tasted so good.   you know what, we still got that fruit pikachu found.   that's right.  here, pachirisu.     uhoh.   hey, what happened.   brock, we got a big problem.   pachirisu's running a fever.   oh, no.  hmm.  a high one.   we thought putting ice on its forehead would help, but it didn't.   i know one thing that might help.  watch.  we need to expose its tail.   i've never heard of that.   brock, give it some medicine.   first things first.  let's try to figure out what's wrong.   ..   what, brock.   it's possible that pachirisu's having an electricity buildup.   what.   it happens from time to time with electric types.  electricity builds up and causes a high fever.   yeah, that's right.  that happened before to pikachu.  i remember you were in really bad shape, weren't you.   pika pika.   we've got to get that electricity out.         this medicine will help you regulate your voltage, okay.  now down the hatch.  you'll start feeling better right away.    when a pokemon gets sick, you've got to stay calm.  they can pick up on a trainer's anxiety.  and in the end, it only makes things a lot worse.   i see.   i guess all we were doing was getting freaked out.     i'm so sorry, pachirisu.  i'm an awful trainer.    dawn, don't cry.   right.  we were trying to get something into pachirisu by feeding it some mashed fruit.   that comes a little later.  you feed it an oran berry first.  we looked for oran berries, but no luck.   you won't find them here.  it's not the right environment for oran berries to grow.   brock, why is that.   the problem is this soil is just too dry for them.  let's try over there.     they could certainly grow over here.  look.  this is what we need to feed pachirisu.   brock, that's great.   all right, try this.     pachirisu's eating.   that's great.   pikachu.    star.  star. star staravia.   wooper wooper.  wooo.   star staravia.   james:  sadly, it seems staravia's given us the slip.   we could return to the tried and true and set our sights on pikachu.   yo, what's that.   a cottage, perhaps.   and inside, look.  it's teaming with twerps.   and all their twerpy pokemon, too.   great.  pachirisu, you're fever's breaking.   that oran berry really worked.   yeah.   things should be fine now.     wow, you're feeling that good.       great, pachirisu.  ]  whoa, what was that.   pachirisu.   ash: what's going on.   jessie: to see what's going, just look to the sky.   not easy for twerps, but give it a try.   on the wind.   past the stars.   hey, i can fly.   bringing choas at a breakneck pace.   dashing hope, putting fear in its place.   a rose by any other name's just as sweet.   when everything's worse, our work is complete.   jessie.   and james.   meowth's the name.   putting the dogooders in their place.   we're team rocket.  in your face.   a slight change of plans.   we were banking on bagging pikachu, but we'll settle for this little livewire instead.     what do you mean, "settle".   star. staravia.   staravia, you came back just in time.   if you please.   with ease.  repeat performance of the basooka bonk.   flap your wings and blow 'em away.       all: instant karma.   get pachirisu outta there with aerial ace.   star star starrrr.     pachirisu, you all right.     huh.  but pachirisu, you're still recovering, so why not let the others deal with them.   buneary.   buneary, great.  this is a good time for an ice beam.   buneary.     buneary, nice work.  now, dizzy punch.   bun bun bun bun bun.     you really wanna battle, huh.     hmm.  all right, then.  pachirisu, use discharge.     i feel like a bubble gum popsicle.   a sticky mess.   speak for yourself.   we're blasting off and bummed.  ]    you were great, pachirisu.  but that's enough for now.   she's right.   something like this may happen again in the future, and you still might not have the luxury of locating a pokemon center nearby.  so i really think it would be a good idea for you to learn first aid, both of you.  just in case.   yeah.   brock's right.  our pokemon need us the most when they're sick.  come here.  there.  hey, we're all that you've got.      all right, who's ready for food.   my stomach's making all sorts of noise.   mine, too.     now, i know pachirisu's feeling fine.   yeah, being hungry gives it away every time.   brock: great.  so let's get on it.   dawn: eat right and stay healthy, and we'll never lose.     narrator:although our heroes can breathe a sigh of relief now that pachirisu is back to good health, the responsibilities of being a good trainer have given ash and dawn something to think about and act on as their celestic town journey contin we forgot gliscor.   gliscor.   scooorrr.  captioning provided dan: my whole world changed one day when all these random cards started raining down
