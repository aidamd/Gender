twists and turns are plentiful along the way to solaceon town and dawn's next contest.  and this latest example provides a manor situated on a sprawling estate, nestled deep in the woods.   i don't see anyone.   maybe it's deserted.   well, there aren't any lights on.   till now.   there they are.   huh.   it's the bandit beauties three.  i'll handle 'em.   lux.  lux.   no, not again.   hurry

anything.  it can even spot its prey hiding in the shadows.   of course.  sees through anything.   luxray.  please don't move until i tell you.   lux. luxray.   here comes an iron tail.   all right, pikachu.  you use iron tail, too.   pika.  pika.   lux.   that's a tough pokemon.  okay, come on out.   we're surrounded.   now grab those bandit beauties three.     pikachu.  quick, use thunderbolt.        wow.   what a thunderbolt.  it must be so awesome to use electrictype moves.  .   pika.   excuse me miss but we're not your bandits.   yeah, we're just looking for a place to stay for the night.   yeah, as if.   just a moment.  i've seen these people before on tv.  the hearthome city battle, am i correct.   all: right.   my name's ash.   and i'm dawn.   i'm brock.   pikachu.   i'm matthew.  i own this place.   ha.  i can't believe you thought i thought you were bandits for real.   yeah.  coulda' fooled me.   pika.   so who are these bandit beauties three.   you see, my manor contains a most valuable treasure that is called the old charm.  i received a threatening letter from the bandit beauties three stating they were planning on stealing it.   i gotta say that's a weird name.   their letter said they were super famous, but it doesn't sound to me like you've ever heard of them.   but since you can't take any chances with a priceless treasure like the old charm, i've asked officer jenny and her team for assistance.   you mean jenny .   uh, why yes.   and that's why jenny's trainee number one, me, came to investigate you.   you mean you.   number one.  don't know who spilled the beans, but now that they're spilled it's true.  the name's marble, super duper ace detective.   oh.   yes, not to worry, as luxray and i will solve this mystery.   do you think she can handle it.   well, i couldn't refuse since she came all this way.  say wait.  perhaps you all could help us.   sounds good.  what do you say.   sure.  ..   huh.   oh, all right.  but, you'll work under my command.  .   come on, it'll be great.  you'll have marble, ace detective as your boss.   pika.   so the old charm's in there.   right.  the bandit beauties' letter said they would steal it at precisely 8:00.   then all we have to do is stand guard.   i know it sounds easy, but there's one thing that worries me.  i'm concerned about luxray.  see, it hasn't been that long since luxray evolved from luxio.  now. charge beam.   lux.  ray.   luxray's been unable to learn electric type moves.  though i figured it would get the hang of it eventually.  but when we were helping jny ..   luxray.   quick luxray.  iron tail.  wait.  you're not supposed to use charge beam.   ray.   heh.   marble, what are you doing.  now, arcanine, flamethrower.   aah.    excellent.  arcanine, that was great work.     lux.   don't worry, it's okay.   lux.   since then, things have gotten much much worse.  luxray won't listen to a thing i say.  even the arcanine don't like to come around anymore.   i see.  so is that why when you ..   mmhmm.  i was hoping if luxray could learn some electrictype moves maybe luxray would listen to me again.   then this sounds like special trainin' time.   pika pika.   but when luxray gets angry, things can get really, really scary.  i don't know how we could do do any special training ha ha. wheeee.  hey, ronald. come on, let's go play.  oh, i wish i could, but i have to go to work.  bye. bye, ronald.  .    okay, here i am at work.  now we can play. woohoo. yay.  . ba da ba ba ba .  whoa. wahahaha.   everything under control.   sir.  .    beauties three that are under control.   waba.   shh.   but isn't our name just a teensy bit of a stretch.   hmm.  .  i may be the only beauty, but out of the goodness of my heart i included you.   what a gal.   i'm still trying to wrap my brain around what .  maybe it's a box of shiny gold doubloons or something.   no, no, even more treasure like would be reams of rare bottle caps.   please.  it must be more charming than you two could imagine.   well whatever it is, it's gonna make us mounds of mojo.  yo.   waba.   shh.   okay there's only ten minutes to go.   all right.  come on bandit beauties three.  give it your best shot.   we've gotta tussle .   keep your ties on.  don't forget we're the law.  move out.  yes, good evening.  we have direct orders matthew to transport the treasure.   but it's so close to 8:00.   brilliant.  wait until the last minute and fool the thieves.   oh yeah.  i was thinking exactly the same thing.    off we go.   just a sec.   what if you're actually the bandit
