'kay, let's figure this out.  i'm pretty sure when zoey battled mismagius it used psychic moves and magical leaf.   then we're gonna have to deal with magical leaf's power as well.  chimchar, i choose you.   chimchar.   let's see what you've got, chimchar.   magius.   flame wheel, now.   chimchar.   mismagius.  magius.  i had no idea chimchar could jump.   oh, man.  that must take a lot of power.   actually, that kind of agility is easy for chimchar.  piece of cake.   go.     hmm.  alors,mismagius, psywave.   mismagius.   char.   ahh.   uhoh.   char.   oh, no.   lup.   that looked like some real damage.  psychic moves are sure something to behold.   hey, chimchar, are you okay.     does this surprise you, ash.  well, hang on because there is much i have left to show you.  that psywave can sure be a pain.  alright, chimchar, spin and then use flamethrower.     so, now this time it's going to be a fire counter shield.  bien fait.     use psywave.   mismagius.  mismagius mismagius.   no. not again.   we held that off, too.   awesome. ash is kicking.   he can counter moves other than hypnosis.   well, that's because ash has gotten really good at using attacks for defense.  attacks like that are effective on lots of moves other than hypnosis.   let's see how you deal with this.  mismagius, magical leaf.   mismagius.    char.   it can't be.   i don't understand how fantina already broke through.   chimchar's moves are supposed to be powerful against grasstype attacks.   if i had to guess, i'd say she's hammering chimchar with magical leaf to break the counter shield.  quelle dommage,ash.  the truth is i learned everything about the counter shield when you used it before on gengar,oui.   oh, man.  and after all our hard work.  .  there are all kinds of thingsin the world of avatar.  ..  hey.  .  when you play with them.  .  rthere's one in your mcdonald's happy meal.  . ba da ba ba ba .    'kay, chimchar, use flamewheel again.   dark pulse,tout suite.   chimchar.   mismagius.   chimchar, flamethrower, keep it up.    ]  look, now he's using flamewheel as a counter shield this time.   awesome.  ash's battling style just seems to get more and more amazing.   lup.   mismagius, psywave, s'il vous plait.   yeah, i thought so.   huh.   mismagius.   hey, was only the flamethrower hit.   char.    mismagius.     mismagius is unable to battle.  chimchar is the winner.   nooo.   yeah, we did it, chimchar.   pikachu.     and now, since ash has all of his pokemon left, it's a threetoone battle.   i figured if i blocked your dark pulse you'd follow up with the psywave, and i was right.   no sense trying to pull the wool over your eyes, is there.  i amtres impressionne.   first off, you knock away that psywave with a flamethrower and then you hit your opponent where it really hurts with a powerful flamewheel.  that's got ash written all over it.   ash is too much.  i can't take it.     you did exactly what you needed you to.  thanks, chimchar, take a good rest.   chimchar seems a lot different from back when paul had it.  i saw the two of them competing a while ago, and even though they won the thing, chimchar didn't seem nearly as happy as it is now.   huh.   all right, ladies and gentlemen, contesta has the high privilege and distinct honor to present our winner jessilina with the majolica ribbon.   the majolica ribbon.  mine and mine alone.   yan yan.   the cheers.  the lights and applause.  and they're all meant for marvie me.   number one. our jess.   mime mime.   with two robots under her yellow belt.   wobbuffet.   and now for my third pokemon, voila.drifblim.   blim.   whoa, it's drifblim.   ash, i amcertainmentyou must remember drifblim and as you can plainly see, it has gotten even stronger and more beautiful than before.   blim blim.   it's up to you, buddy.   pika.   all right, use thunderbolt.   pika.  pikachuuuuu.   wow. what a hit.  drifblim can't move.   piplup.   pi.   fantina, you may have wiped out our flame shield with your magical leaf, but now what're you gonna do about our electric shield.   you certainly didn't waste time paralyzing drifblim, now did you.  but perhaps you forget, drifblim can use psychic moves as well like psychic.   blim.  ]  pika.   yes, your counter shield is an excellent strategy but ash, please remember all good things must come to an end, n'est ce pas.  i think your strategy has sprung a leak.  so perhaps the time has come for you to do some retooling while i do a little myself.  voila.  willowisp.  now use psychic to control the willowisp.     pikachu, knock it away with thunderbolt.   pikachuuuuuuu.   it's sealed up.   as you can plainly see, my drifblim is sealed into the counter shield.  it's like a counter counter shield.   pika.   drifblim's psychic maintains the powerful rings of willowisp.  and it will last much longer than any move of yours.  alors,on we go.    ]  this is exactly like their last battle.  pika, thunderbolt, go.   pikachuuuuuu.   aah.   hypnosis.   pikachu, deflect it with thunderbolt.   pika pi.   blim.   no way.   now, ominous wind.   blim.   pikachu.   huh.   pikachu's unable to battle.  drifblim's the winner.   oh, no.   lup.   pikachu, that was an awesome job.  thank you.   pika pi.   hey, listen, your hard work's gonna pay off.  i'm sure of it.   pika pika.   hmm.   got ...but keep your mind wi is there a king.  isn't this cool. we can do anything no, it's a gia run.

'kay, chimchar, looks like you're the last up.  i'm counting on ya.   chimchar.   so come and get it.   flame wheel, now.   chiiiimm charrr.   sorry, but that move's still the same.   char.  char.   flame on flame, huh.   that's strange.  is something funny.   what's up.   ash figured something out.   it's gonna take more than that to break their willowisp.   if they wanna see flames, we'll show 'em flames.  flamethrower, go.   chiimm chaarrr.   my counter shield works against any move.   bliiiiim.   aahh.   that's it.   pika.   it worked.  it broke their shield.   it didn't just break the shield, that flamethrower absorbed the willowisp, making it even more powerful.  guess you don't know everything about counter shields after all.   perhaps i spoke a bit too soon.  your chimchar's power is vraiment magnifique, but i'm afraid your rematch road ends here.  ominous wind, drifblim.   blim.   chimchar, dig. let's go.   char.   chimchar, grab hold of drifblim, quick.   char.  ]  chimchar.   i've never seen dig used like that.  go figure.  quellesurprise.  but now it's time for hypnosis.   bhr, flamethrower.   char.   bliiim.   char.     drifblim is unable to battle and chimchar wins.  and the match goes to ash the challenger.   we did it, guys.   they really beat fantina.   piplup.   he actually pulled it off.   things were shaky there for a while, but ash pulled it off.  what a great battle.  merci beaucoup,drifblim.  you are a true hard worker.   drifblim.   congratulations, ash.  you and all your pokemon are trulymagnifique.  s'il vous plait, take the relic badge.   wow, thanks so much.  all right.  we got the relic badge.   pi pikachu.   bwee bwee.   barry, where are you gonna go now.   it's a nobrainer.  i'm going to iron island.   iron island.   yeah, i trained there for a while and won at the canalave gym.  i figure it'll be a good idea to train there again.  and that's my strategy.   whoa, that's a strategy.   dawn: see, iron island's over there.  it's a boat ride from canalave city.   so maybe my next gym should be the canalave gym, too.  hey, why don't we all go there together.   okay.  if you win there, then maybe i'll start thinking of you as a real rival.   huh.   pika.   see, the canalave gym's main focus is steel types.  so give it a shot, if you dare.  i kinda doubt you can.   i'm so sure badge number six is gonna be mine, they might as well give it to me upfront.   hmm.   well, you can't accuse them of not getting into it.   and no doubt, our trip to canalave city won't be dull in the least.   narrator:filled with confidence after his fifth sinnoh gym victory, ash along with the rest of our heroes look ahead to the next chapter in their journey with the feisty barry along for the ride.  the excitement's guaranteed, and the adventure continues. my whole world changed one day when all these random cards started raining down everywhere.  at first they seemed harmless enough so a bunch of us kids
