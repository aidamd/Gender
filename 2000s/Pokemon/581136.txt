 what was that .  let's check it out.   someone's on top .   something's wrongwe'd better help him.  piplup . man, he looks bad.  huh .  my name's pokmon ranger ben.   pokmon ranger .  that's right, and i've got one job: to spend my time protecting peace and justice for people and pokmon .  my name is ash.  hi, my name's dawn.  and i'm brock.  see, that feraligatr carried you downstream here to us.  thanks a lot, feraligatr.  feraligatr .  so does that mean feraligatr's your partner .  yeah, well, it comes to me when i summon it using the ranger sign.  ranger sign .  the ranger sign is a way of summoning pokmon that i've bonded with in the past.  i just use my capture styler.   i can't believe it, it's not there .  my capture styler is missing.  what am i gonna do .  one thing.  have you guys seen a heatran around here .  a heatran .   heatran.  the lava dome pokmon.  heatran lives in volcanic caves, and uses its crossshaped claws to maneuver across stone walls.  how come .  is something wrong .  well, i discovered a special heatran that can use eruption.  special .  a normal heatran can't learn eruption.  that's amazing.  i was so close to bringing that heatran back to the national park when i lost sight of it .  but it's okay.  no matter what happens, i'm still a pokmon ranger .  nice recovery.  right, it is good to look at the bright side.  right .  finding that heatran is job one.  i may have lost my capture styler, but i may have met some nice people to help me.   huh .  do you think you'd be able to give me a hand .  sure, sounds like a real blast.  great, let's go .  come on .  someone's in a rush.  we were so close to taking ownership of that heatran.  ah, if only to be given a second chance to catch that scampering scamp.  yeah, fat chance.  hey, look over there .  wasn't the pokmon ranger carrying that thing .  that's a capture styler.  it allows one to capture pokmon and control them at will.  well, our fugitive heatran's a pokmon, is it not .  signs point to yes.  yeah .  so if we used this baby to capture heatran and bring it to the boss...  "i'll tell you, everything tastes much better when it's cooked using heatran heat." "and there's nothing more relaxing than a heatran sauna.  "'course, heating the old mansion with heatran power "allows me to go green and save green as well.  "you know, meowth and friends deserve some serious green for giving me such a thoughtful and rocking gift." his gifts rock.    no wonder we're smiling    'cause soon we'll be styling    and be rich   and we won't have to match wits with those tacky twerps.  though i only use half my wits to keep it fair.  wobbuffet .  the heatran must be nearby.  i feel it.  but, really, how can you be so sure .  don't worry .  so long as we keep moving, we're bound to find it.  you're always looking at the bright side of things.  so what's your secret .  i always remember the motto that's been in my family for generations.  a motto . right.  i was actually the most negative kid you'd ever want to meet.  when faced with an obstacle, no matter how small, i'd always give up.  but when i was down, my grandfather always said, "remember, son, it's always better to try than to cry." great words to live by.   but, what did he mean by that .  you can either try and get things done or sit around complaining, but not both.  you know, if you don't succeed, try, try again.  so now, no matter what happens, i know that so long as i keep trying, things will work out.  makes sense.  but if you're gonna find heatran, you must have a plan.  i sure do.  hey, what're you doin' . pika .  checking the temperature of the ground.  but why .  heatran always live near volcanoes, so it stands to reason that it would be somewhere where the ground feels warm to the touch.  wow, that makes sense to me.  that's why you're a pokmon ranger.  wow, your knowledge of pokmon is huge.  yeah, now we're getting somewhere .  when your child isfeeling stuffy, rely on children's sudafed products.  they effectively relieve children's nasal and head congestion without causing drowsiness.  so your child can get back to being a kid again.  try children's sudafed.  warmer.  the ground's especially warm around here.  it could have something to do with the flow of magma, right .  awesome, let's check it out .  right .  give me a break.  mixing twerps with a pokmon ranger could make this pokmon sick.  still, if the ranger's nearby, that could mean heatran's nearby, true .  think of it.  we can conveniently use that captured capture styler to capture heatran and pikachu, true .   yay .  the ground temperature's really rising now, just like i thought.   it's more fun giving a hot foot than getting one .  that's strange.  up there .  pika . lup .  whoa .   it's like a lake of lava. yeah.  look up there .  it's heatran.   piplup .  that's its special ability, flash fire.  heatran's absorbing all of the heat from the magma flow.  i'm glad we found it, but what are you gonna do now .  i could catch it if i only had my styler.  so why don't you just catch heatran with a pokball .  that's out of the question .  a major part of my mission is to make sure heatran's brought back to the national park completely untouched.  oh, of all the bad times to lose my capture styler .  well, why cry over spilt milk .  better to try than cry.  the master of bouncing back. let's go .   i admire your optimism, but that's dangerous.  never say never .  onward and upward .  what's that .  a diglett .  what is going on here .  it's a robodiglett, thank you very much.  guess the optimist's out of touch.  on the wind . past the stars .  winning in the clutch .  bringing chaos at a breakneck pace .  dashing hope, putting fear in its place .  a rose by any other name's just as sweet.  when everything's worse, our work is complete .  it's jessie. and james.  meowth, that's a name .  putting the dogooders in their places.  we're team rocket .   in your faces .  team rocket .  see, they're a bunch of guys with one job and one job only.  is it to protect peace and justice .  for people and pokmon .  nah, team rocket's job is to steal people's pokmon.  what do you want this time . pika, pika .  we'll be taking the heat with heatran, man.  and we've got just the supercool toy to do it with, dig .  feast your eyes .  hey, how did you get ahold of my styler .  on .  it's the imaginextspace shuttle and launch pad .  whoa .  you can turn the figureto deploy the moon rover and defeat the aliens .  fire .  yeah .  imaginext space shuttle and plaunch pad comes as seen here.  pother products psold separately.  do you kung zhu.  the zhu artifacts have beenstolen.  now it can be your mission tobattle and

heatran, to hang upon my every word.  yes, yes, yes, yes, yes . , james, james, james, james .  a styler with style.  capture on .  your style's a big zero.  what's with the dud .  did you think that was going to work for you .  i'm the only one who can use that styler.  besides that, if you really want to capture a pokmon, you've got to bond with it.  oh, drat, and it looks so cool.  now give it back.  take it.  and it doesn't look cool .  stop, stooge .  if ya give it back, he's just gonna capture heatran .  right.  point well taken, i must say.  let's do this the oldfashioned way.  meowth, please. with ease .  when it comes to spinning a mean web, we're the bomb .  try and stay calm.  that was heatran's eruption .  heatran's in trouble. pika .  hold onben, what're you doin' .  this whole area's gonna collapse any minute.  i'm getting my styler back and getting heatran out of here, quick.  ben.  but that's a lava pool.  this is crazy .  we need ice and water to cool things down.
