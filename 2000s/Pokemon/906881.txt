    oh, yeah.  well, i'll bet you can't even see your knees.   well, for your information, i need a new uniform.   what.   what's wrong.   you look sick.   i just remembered something.  as i was putting on my boots this morning, i realized my belt was buried in belly.   you mean your belly was billowing out over your buckle.   when you can't see anything south of the borderline, that means you're getting chunky.   i don't want to be chunky.   do we suffer the same fate.   well, i hate to break this to you, but while we were slacking off at that summer school, we were packin' on more lbs than a bowl of alphabet soup, get it.   all: fat heads, fat heads roly poly fat heads.   help.  it's all downhiill from here.tony. tony.  what taste gets athletes this  frosted flakes.  .  . we are tigers .  crunchy flakes perfectly coated with sweet ..  makes them a great tasting part of a nutritious breakfast.  . mighty, mighty tigers .  .  kellogg's frosted flakesare more than good.  ..  grrrrreat.  .  this will not do.  we're a lean mean team rocket fighting machine.  not a bunch of ice cream floats.  like three freshly blooming roses, we're definitely dashing, dignified, and debonair.  lest we forget the tortuous team rocket training we once endured.   and being team rocket's aplus actress, i could've claimed to be a preteen and gotten away with it.   and even constantly competin' with the boss' stable of rare pokemon, i could still rise to the top of the lap heap.    it's time for some basic training.  ..  bivouac.   right soldiers.  back to the basics.  to return to our roots and once again fit in our suits.   weird when she makes sense, you know.   tote that barge.  and lift that bale.  it's shape up time.   that may be a bit over the top.   look out, she's gonna pop.   pop. not i.  i'm harking back to when we aspired to team rocket greatness.   when ambition was the order of the day.   and the order didn't include fries.  ..  ..   for me.   excuse us, won't you.   huh.   but would it trouble you terribly if we sat here.   no, have a seat.   we actually just finished stuffing our wellfed faces.     we said that.   we were so nice.   like decent dopes.   now isn't that nice.  thank you very much, young folks.   kind of refreshing to come across such kind and caring youngsters, isn't it.   gee, thanks a lot.   refreshing.   the horror and the shame.   we're so round, we've lost all our edges.   all our evilnesses have been routed by our rolls.   all:  we've got to cut the fat and get back to where we're at.   wobbuffet.  ]   pip.  piplup.   you're awake.   piiiip lup.  piplup, pip.   we're in a pokemon center.   piplup.   ii had no idea how hard i've been working you, piplup.  and i'm so very sorry.   pip.   i don't deserve you as a

 piplup did wake up once, but fell right back asleep.   well, well, dawn.  it's nice to see you again.   huh.  it's the poetry man.     pika.   professor oak's just giving me some advice.  hey, you might be interested in this, too.   what kind of advice.   you'll see.  so, please continue what you were saying, 'kay.   of course.  when it comes to size and power, gliscor's got the upper hand, but the problem arises if your opponent is somehow able to get behind gliscor, which will enable an attack with ease.  the point being, you need to pay attention to agility as you raise gliscor.   agility, got it.   a simple word, agility.  a simple key to battling victory.   that's awesome.  you write poetry even when you're giving out advice.    by the way, i do hope that you're exchanging information with other trainers and coordinators.   i'm not sure what you mean.   the pokemon center's a place for friends.  for meeting old and new that's for you.   i see.  then that means there's something useful i can be doing, even when piplup's resting.   cool. information exchange.   pika pika pi.   i'll do it.  thanks a lot, professor oak.  see ya.  hi there. how are you.   i'm fine, thanks.   your glaceon has such beautiful fur.  you've gotta have a trick or two up your sleeve to make it look like that.   it's in the way i use the brush.   wow, that sounds awesome.  would you

for nurse joy.   aww.   you see, with all the pokemon nurse joy is taking care of, her hands are full.  so i want to do anything i can to help my nurse joy out.  she works tirelessly without thinking about herself, so it's the least we can do for her, the very least.  don't you think.   wow, thank you very much, brock.  you're such a big help.  i just love folks who look out for other folks.  that sounds like you, don't you think.   that sounds more like you, my dear nurse joy.  and because you spend all of your time taking care of us, it is i who should be now thanking you.  my nurse joy.   my dear brock.      croagunk.   oh, come on.  imagination is against the law.    croa.   james: team rocket is back ..   jess:..   meowth:..   and meowth. take a guess.   eh.  target tagged.   excellent.  now let's get our svelte selves into the pokemon center and start swiping.   perfect.  a lovely way to get back to our roots.   get a load of this, boss.  watch experts make some magic.   i suggest we split into two teams.   okey doke.   yeah, okey doke.  course, when i agreed to this, i hadn't planned on being part of team yahoo.  hey, whatever.  it's time for you three tender feet to boogie to the basics.     behind those walls is a wealth of pokeballs.   then let us now proceed to claim our wealth.  a mere bag of shells.  hmm.    hmm.  hmm. hmm. hmm.   hmm.       wob.   mime.     wob.

prepare for trouble and a blast from the past.   and make it double.  aren't the oldies a gas.   to protect the world from devastation.   to unite all peoples within our nation.   to denounce the evils of truth and love.   to extend our reach to the stars above.   jessie.   and james.   team rocket blasts off at the speed of light.   surrender now or prepare to fight, fight, fight and fight.   meowth, that's right.   it's team rocket.   it's bad enough we have to put up with your usual routine, but what was that.   history a trip down memory lane that got our groove thing back.   we do still have it, don't we.  where everything old is new again.   and now we're gonna show you the basics of beating the pants off of ya.   yanmega, come out and use silver wind.     carnivine, bullet seed.   carnivine.     pikachu, let's go.  use thunderbolt.   yanmega, shank them with sonic boom.        when you're in tiptop shape as we are, miracles never cease.   yeah, but wait, there's more.  check out our new back to the basics vavoomian fly trap.   it is flying.   so are we.   vavoomian.   now that's tone.  an echoed chunk of robo hunk.  ..  pragmatically modeled after another work of art, namely me.   we dropped the weight and we're feeling great.  so in honor of back to the basics i basically drained our wallets for this.   i know what.  let's show the kids how to rough up twerps.   cool beans.   first, rocket punch.   look out.   pika.   that thing can punch.   next up, rocket kick.   it's the pick of the kick.   back and better than ever.   we're bad. good bad.

bolts.  na na.   twerpy dolts.  quick, meowth, let's forge a hasty retreat tout suite.   after all, we've got piles of pokeballs.   once word gets out down at headquarters, we'll have piles of smiles.   yeah, or maybe not.   huh.   chuuuuu.   wait, back up.  why the wilt.   because.   because. spill it.  huh.    spill it means saying what went wrong.   since that thing wasn't made to handle electric attacks, who cares.   what were you thinking.   i was thinking we were getting back to basics, brainiac.   deja vu.  remember our first robot was devoid of any electric defenses as well.   when it comes to paying attention to detail, i'm a stickler, see.   i'm a stickler when it comes to paying attention to pain.   we're blasting off again.  ]  thank you all so much.  because of your generous help, everybody's pokemon are back home safe and sound.   we need to thank you.   you really helped us out.   though it's not helping my heart to leave you.   now, piplup, please don't overdo it.   piplup piplup.   narrator:team rocket may have gotten a little leaner and meaner, but thankfully to no avail.  leaving all of our heroes happy, healthy and fit, celestic town awaits and the journey continues.whole world changed one day when all these random cards started raining down everywhere.  at first they seemed harmless enough so a bunch of us kids invented this cool new game...
