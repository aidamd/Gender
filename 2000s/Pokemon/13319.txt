'nother kettle of a catch .  oh, natch, and a rare beauty like me will accept nothing less than a rare pokmon like that .  then let's aim high in the sky and give deoxys a try .  the stones are glowing .  those strange stones are found all around here.  something's wrong with all the controls .  huhthe ship is being attracted .  it must be the energy coming from those rocks .  they must be meteors . meteors .  officer jenny, get your boat out of here now .   got it .  what's going on .  i think deoxys is converting the meteor's energy into its own power.  it's also creating a strong magnetic field, which attracts objects towards it.  wanna play rough, ehyanmega, show 'em how .   we're blasting off again .   wobbuffet .   wow, thanks, deoxys.  pika, pika . piplup .  cor, cor, cor,

the deserted island where the sunken meteors are to reenergize themselves.   well, the meteors come from space, and they say deoxys comes from space, too .  a pokmon that uses meteors to receive its power.  that's so mysterious .  deoxys isn't all.  think of how many more mysterious pokmon there are that we haven't even come across yet .  pika, pika . piplup .  they're rightit's chocovine town .  helping a pokmon in need can bring other pokmon even closer together, as is the case with pikachu and piplup.  and so,with old and new friends sharing excitement and adventure, their journey continues .  captioned bysoundwriters  . .      aw puey.  not more trickortreaters.  there's something i don't like about halloween.  maybe it's giving perfectly good candy away to total strangers instead of me eating it.   trick or treat.    here's one for you and one for you and one for you.  here's one for me, and one for me, and one for me.  ooh, peppermint.   now make sure you don't eat all the candy, garfield.  leave some for the trickortreaters.   hey.  the bowl's empty.  the candy is all gone.    gee, i wonder where it all went.  ]  oh, i'd better go out and buy some more.   ahem.  first, dinner.  then you go out and buy some more.    ooh. more trickortreaters.  garfield, get the door.   trick or treat.   or wash your feet.   sorry, all out of candy.  come back next year.   garfield.  that's mean.  open the door and give them something we don't need.   here.  we don't need this.   huh.   garfield.  you can't give odie away.   oh the only candy we have left now is this old taffy you didn't eat last halloween.   don't touch any of it.   hey, don't worry.  there are some things in the world even i won't eat.  and stale taffy is most of them.  aah, this is the night for free goodies.  all i need is a costume.  let's see now.  hey, odie, what do you think i should go as.     besides an overweight pussycat.   the scarier the costume, the more treats you get.  now let's see what can i dress as that will be really scary.   i'm coming to you live from the zoo where visitors are flocking to see what may well be the scariest creature ever ..     he's catzilla, a rare and near descendant of the prehistoric sabretooth tiger.   everyone seems very afraid of him.   which might mean they'll give him lots and lots of candy.   jon won't mind if i use his paint.  and the reason he won't mind is he won't know.  where's that toy walrus jon won at the carnival ring toss game last year.  mind if i borrow these.  of course you don't.  you're a toy.  now, i need to capture that savage catzilla look.   no, no good.  if i'm going to look really mean, i'll have to think of something to make me look really hostile.   i'm asorry, kitty cat.  we have no more pepperoni for your pizza.  how about some nice raisins.   no, more hostile than that.   come on, garfield.  let's do some aerobic exercises and then we'll eat nothing but lettuce for a month.   not quite.  it's got to be something to make me truly hostile.   hiya, garfield.  yes, it's me nermal.  i'm coming to live with you and i'm gonna sleep in your bed.    ] that's it.  ..to the treats.   hey, let's see what's on ..   before we go, let's take one ..   we can't get too close to ..  where's the fierce beast.  where's catzilla.  oooh.  he's gone.  catzilla has escaped.       aaahh.  we'd better lock the doors.  we're not far from the zoo.     garfield: hope they have peanut brittle.  hope they have peanut brittle.  hope hope hopeope.   oh. this is terrible.  that beast is loose.   oooh. oooh.  maybe i'd better warn the trickortreaters to get inside.   ooh. did you see the news.  they said   pretty good.  hey, no peanut brittle.   that's right catzilla.  he's on this street.  oooh.  send help at once.  ] catzilla.   another good haul.  but no peanut brittle.   of course i recognized him.  it was catzilla.  right here on my street.  ]  what is it with these people.  don't they know how popular peanut brittle is.   it was catzilla, i'm sure of it.  i was just watching the tv news report of how he escaped from the zoo.    let's see.  twentythree houses.  twentythree bowls of candy.  total amount of peanut brittle.  zero.  maybe i'll have better luck at the next twentythree houses.   man on pa: there he is.  right there.   we have you surrounded.  he's making a break for it.  after him.   he's hopping the fence.  get the light on him.   hey, do i tell everybody what you're up to.   ..hiding place...   no sign of him back here.  when they catch him, they're gonna to ship him off to a zoo in siberia.   siberia.  all i wanted was some peanut brittle.  i have to get home.  i'll be safer there.      almost there.  almost there.   we have reports that catzilla has been sighted on the west side.     he is extremely dangerous and everyone is warned to watch for him.  ] )
