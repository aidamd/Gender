 hey, turn it loose, don't bend it .  we didn't bring a can opener .  now, piplup, use whirlpool .  piplup .  piplup .   brain drain .  not another machine .   those twerps are so mean .  pikachu, ash, are you okay .  yeah, we're both all right.  pika, pika .  we've gotta get this manhole open.  piplup, piplup.  piplup .  piplup, pip .  your form was the least little bit off, but it's the thought that counts.  that manhole cover is so bent, this could be a problem.  ash, the manhole cover is so mushed it won't open .   gotcha .  it's okay, we'll just have to find another way out .  wow, i guess this canal must run underneath the whole town.  pika.  this place is so huge, i'm afraid we could get lost down here, bigtime.  all right, buizel, i choose you .  buibuizel .  buizel, i need you to find us a way to get outta here, 'kay .  bui, bui... bui .  hey, look, it's those guys .  luxio .  come on, we didn't do anything, so what was that for .  luxio .  you asked for it .  buizel, aqua jet, let's go .  bui... luxio .  bui .  strong stuff .  pika. where'd they go .  man, those three sure can move fast.  did you hear that . pika.  it's a wailmer .  wail .  and them again .  i see.  they're feeding the wailmer with the pokmon food they took.  wail...  whis, whis .  lux .  hey, guys, i can help you three push the wailmer back into the water.  go .  lux .  lux .  push hard .  no goodthis wailmer's not budging a bit .  let me think.   wailmer, the ball whale pokmon.  it spouts water out of its nose and becomes lethargic when its body becomes dry.  "when its body becomes dry." hey, that's it .  let's get some water on wailmer, and that'll do the trick .  whoa, that worked like a charm .  lux.  but what in the world's a wailmer doing way down here .  pika.  i wonder if this has something to do with all those wailord that are hanging around in the harbor right now.  did you get separated from the group up in the harbor, wailmer .  luxio, lux, lux.  whismur, whis .  luxio must be leading the wailmer back to where the rest of its buddies are.  great, come on, let's go finish what we started and help 'em out, pikachu .  pikachu . bui, bui .  happiny.  not even happiny can open it.  i know, let's get mamoswine to solve this .  mamo .  now, mamoswine, i want you to open the manhole cover .  not again .  excuse me, mamoswine, would you please listen to me for a change .  mamo.   well, i tried.  if you open the manhole cover, you can have all these delicious poffins .  mamo, mamo .  just like a bottle cap .  i knew you could do it .  mamo, mamo .   dawn, no .  if there were ever a need for me to worry, i'd say this is it .  happiny .   zubat and mothim .  teddiursa, too .  venonat, rattata, nidoran .  who would've thought pokmon were living down here .  luxio .  i get the feeling you're their leader, right .  lux, luxio, lux .  so that totally explains why you would wanna help out the wailmer that wandered in down here.  everybody's helping each other.  hey, where are you, ash .  ash . piplup .  i wonder where he could have gone down here .  piplup, piplup .  piplup .  you sure it's that way . piplup, piplup.  absolutely, positively certain .  piplup .  why am i not sure .   pika, pika, pika, pikachu.  so you're telling me you fell all the way down from there .  well, getting back up there isn't gonna be easy.  pika .  man, what do we do .  xt turns on the adventures... .  it's the sky racers dare devilracing team and the sky racers carrieris where it all happens .  you can turn the pilots toraise the elevator  and rotate the runway.  sky racers twister...  tornado prop  tiger shark and twin eagle.  can you launch the buoys .  avoid the flares... then race to the finish line .   . imaginext turnson the adventures... .  yeah . yeah .  nice flying, ace .  imaginext sky racers carriertcomes as shown.  other planes sold separately.  hang on tight, okay .  now let's do it .  and pull .  harder .  whismur, whismur, whismur .  wow, we did it .  pikachu .   you've got to be kidding .  i don't think we'll be able to pull anything up over that .  don't worrylisten .  i told you we'd get you back to your group, and i meant it .  do you think that you can get all your friends to help us, luxio .  lux, luxio . great .  piplup, piplup .  piplup, are you sure we're going the right way .  there's nobody here .  piplup.  man...  piplup.   okay, you get it .  that's why we need everybody to help us .   pika, pikachu .  luxio .   ursa, ursa .   nidoran, nidoran .  yeah, we'll definitely do it now .  ahh .  i guess you're saying i should thank 'em first.  lux.  okay, i'm gonna explain the plan i came up with, so i want everyone to listen carefully, 'kay .  first, the spheal will use their ice beam and freeze the canal all the way up to the top.   pika, pikachu.  we're gonna make a big slide .  next, we'll make a sled using the furniture we borrowed from the teddiursa .  pika, pikachu.  then, buizel and the spheal will push the sled with all their might while wailmer's riding on top .   spheal .  and once the sled really gets moving, it's pikachu and luxio's turn .  you two'll unleash a couple of powerful iron tails on the sled so it really starts moving, and then the sled'll have enough speed to shoot up the ice slide right along with wailmer.  and then wailmer will reach the top .  so, are we good, everybody .  cool, so let's do this .   nice .  now that's one frozen slide .  we're all ready to roll .  so on to the last step .  all right, pikachu and luxio, you two ready .  pika . luxio .  okay, buizel and spheal, push wailmer as hard as you can .  all right, now keep it up just like that, but give it more power .  pikachu and luxio, iron tail .  luxio .  yes .  pika . lux .  ahh .  veno, veno, venonat, veno, venonat .  veno .  yeah .  i knew it would work, we did it .  yeah .  things got a little bit hairy for awhile, didn't they .  pika.  there's the exit down there .  pip, piplup, piplup .  come on, piplup, that's enough.  i'm exhausted .  dawn and brock .  it is ash .  pip, piplup, piplup, piplup .  okay, piplup, i deserve that.  and thank you .  lu  yeah    oh, yeah   it's new marshmallow pebbles.  no leading cereal has more marshmallows to rock your whole mouth.  the marshmallowest part of a complete breakfast.   oh, yeah    ..  same chef boyardee ravioli, same gigantic ears.  that seems unnecessary.  all this time, you've sat in the comfort of that meaty ravioli while i was in the bush.  you outgrew me and left me under a bush five years ago.  and there ain't no ravioli out there, son.  just dirt.   mom.  chef boyardee micro beef ravioli.  the saucy, meaty taste you never outgrow.  huhokay, now i get it.  so luxio stole the pokmon food for the wailmer .  wow, i'll bet the wailord hanging out in the harbor are wondering what happened.  everything's going to be all right since the exit is just up ahead .  hey . whoa .  what was that for .  luxio's using electrical pulses from its claws to try and tell us something.  is there something going on we need to be concerned about .   swam...  swampert .  swampert .  a swampert .   swampert, the mud fish pokmon.  swampert is a powerful pokmon that can drag even a large ship, as well as inflict critical damage to its enemies with one blow.  swam .  whoa, you were trying to warn us that we're in the middle of swampert's territory, weren't you, luxio .  lux .  swampert, hold on .  we didn't come down here to mess around with your territory .  swam .  guess we've got no other choice but to use thunderbolt, bigtime .  pika...  don't do it, ash, swampert is a groundtype .  electrictype attacks won't do a thing .  you're rightback off, pikachu .  grotle, i choose you .  grotle . swampert .  that was great, grotle .  now use razor leaf .  grotle .  swampert...  sorry about that, swampert .  oh, finally .  it's great to be outside again .  go on, wailmer .  yeah, you go on and join your friends now.  it's going to be just fine.   i... can't believe it .  it evolved into a wailord .  it can't fit under the bridge .  i'm sure that's a drawbridge, so the span is able to lift up.  quick, we've got to get into the control room .  pikachu.  can you move it . no.  i'm afraid we can't get the bridge to move if we don't have a key .  go, pikachu .   what are you doing .  pikachu .  that's crazy . it moved .  yeah, but we still don't have enough power.  oh, no, not againswampert .  brock and dawn, take care of things here .  i'll stop swampert .  swampert, don't do it .   lux .  now, pachirisu, help us .  good, just a little more .  swampert, swampert .  it won't make it in time .  luxluxio .  now that's what i call real power .  it opened .  wailord, get moving .  swampert, swampert.  swamp...  yeah, great .  pika, pika .   wow, it's beautiful .   piplup.  maybe that's their way of thanking us for helping them .  yeah. pika, pika.  luxio, i'm never gonna forget any of you guys as long as i live .  luxio.  hey, you're welcome if that's a "thank you." well, guess we can get back on the road now.  right .  but my stomach's saying we ought to take a little break at the pokmon center, you know .  when it comes to ash's stomach, missing lunch is a nono .  noi mean, yeah .    no matter what size or shape, our heroes will help anypokmon they can, in this case, leaving a grateful wailord, luxio and many friends in their wake .  but after lunch, it's on to dawn's next sinnoh contest challenge .  captioned bysoundwriters 5 .  go.  . hot wheels battle force 5 .  . drive together to survive .  . fight. fight. fight. in the battlezone .  . gotta drive to survive .  . never back down .  . never give in .  . it's time to drive battle
