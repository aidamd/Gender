psy.   a little psyduck.   what a cutie.   awesome.  the eggs are hatching.   look at them glow.   wow.  now they've got three little psyduck.  they may be just hatched, but they're already holding their heads.   that's one of their unique characteristics.   psy.   no, i don't think you understand.  we're your friends.   maybe if i go ahead and whip up some special pokemon ..   great idea.  i'm

it's kind of weird.   what do you mean.   this lake is awfully tiny for all these psyduck to make their home here.   huh.   you're right.   it's like a pond.   now looking at this map, lake psyduck's a totally separate body of water.   really.  so how come the psyduck don't live there.   maybe something bad happened to lake psyduck.     guess something bad did happen.   let's check it out.   hmm.   look at that.   lake psyduck looks like a much better place to live.   yeah, it's certainly big enough for all of them.   and there's plenty of food, too.  so why did they move to that other lake.     look at the muk.   muk, huh.   pokedex:muk, the sludge pokemon.  a horribly toxic liquid seeps out of its body.   ew.     that's sludge bomb.   muk muk muk.   wow, what a vicious bunch.   so the muk
