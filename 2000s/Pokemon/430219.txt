have dawn, brock, and conway trying to cut that lead.  farther out, who could that be.     huh.   aaaahh.    jessilinda from the green team has suddenly and dramatically jumped from last place up to third place.   finally, you can feast your eyes on what i'm really made of.   i must say, impressive feast.  perhaps it might have been a smarter choice for me to keep tabs on you rather than on dawn.        i am not losing to the likes of you, ash ketcham, and that's final.   you're gonna be changing your mind real soon.    go pick on someone from your own planet.     once i start keeping tabs on someone, i don't stop.   slowking.     and it's a neck and neck battle for the number one spot as the competitors enter the tunnel.  and just who emerges in that number one spot is anybody's guess.       enough being pursued.  seviper, take care of that fruitcake with poison tail.   seviper.   aah.     that's against the rules, so stop.   there's nothing more cacophonous in a cave setting than clap

 .  first, from the blue team, we have conway.  and running right behind him is jessilinda from the green team.     wait wait. wait wait.   come on, angie.  just a little more.     pika pika.     shinx. shinx.     hey, you two, you hangin' in there.   mmhmm, we're fine.  thank you, ash.   shinx shinx.   no prob.  glad you're fine.  this isn't over yet.  let's turn this thing around.   pika pika.     i'm not going easy on you just 'cause you saved me.   i didn't think you would.   we're now at the finish line.  ..  conway, followed by jessilinda.   big mistake, not doing a little cardio training was pretty dumb.   put some spring in your step, seviper.  come on, like me.   jessie looks like she just got back from shopping, but with a bounced credit card.   with all those three hots and a cot days, livin' it up in the lap of luxury, she's gotten a little soft around the middle.   huh.   look at that.  here come both ash and angie.  an unexpected turn of events.  the outcome of this race is still up for grabs.  never in my life have i witnessed a triathlon like this.   you can do it.   chansey.   hang in, jessie.  i mean to say, jessilinda.   show 'em a chunk of your sinew and spunk.   these legs aren't in perfect shape for nothing.  that finished line was meant for me.    ..  ..  there.      together: first place is gonna be mine, and that's that.    we have a winner.  we have ash and pikachu in first place.  coming in second is angie and shinx.  which means the red team has taken first and second.   yeah, we did it.   pikachu.    well, so that's that.  congratulations, ash.   shinx shinx.   hey, thank you, angie.  you two, shinx.   pika pika.   the rest of the competitors are making their way in, and we have the final results.  the red team has overtaken the blue team for the victory.     a shame.  my pokemon expertise was unassailable.  but my endurance was strictly sub par.   that's it.  next time i grace the hallowed halls of the summer academy, i'm majoring in food service.   rowan: so this brings our summer academy to an end.  first, congratulations to the red team on their victory.   and of course, the blue and green teams were wonderful too.  and i'm extraspecially overjoyed that not one student was injured.   chansey. chansey.   and so i say goodbye with my one wish for all of you, that the friendship you have with all pokemon deepens, and you always learn from each other.   right.   so we all get this plaque.   of course.  everyone who was involved in the summer academy gets one.   i'm gonna remember this forever.   one more thing you're all invited to the annual final night bonfire.   boy: wow.     boy: wow.   student: ooh.   she didn't get the brass ring, but she gave it the old college try.   no robots from us, and she still managed to stay in the hunt.   how quickly time flies when you're having fun.  i feel empty knowing it's all over.   yeah, and when it comes to feeling empty, my tummy's right on the same page as you are, you know.   now that's odd.  i have the sneaking suspicion we've forgotten something.   i know what you mean, like we forgot the whole point of being here.   whatever.  and besides, we made some real cash.   and our room and board's all been bought and paid for.   since i must have burned enough calories to power a nuclear destroyer, i'd better stoke up for the soontocome leaner season.   miss jessilinda.   hmmm.   you see, we wanted to thank you.  we all had such a lot of fun being in all those classes with you every day.   none of us will ever forget the awesome week we spent here with you.   i won't.   or me.   thanks, miss jessilinda.   thank you.   aren't you nice.  ..  but thank you.   angie, what's wrong.   it's all done.   huh.   you know, over.  it's the last night.   yeah.  of course.   hmm.  i must have gone to the pokemon summer academy a million times before, but this year was hands down the best one yet.   i had a lot of fun, too.   you know the most amazing thing that happened to me was that you saved my life two times.   well, duh.  i mean, you and i, we're friends.   we are friends, right.  huh.   we'll meet again, no doubt.   yeah. i'll come see ya.  the next time i get to solaceon town.  i know. we'll battle.   and that'll be nice.  can't wait.   narrator:an experience like attending the pokemon summer academy doesn't come along every day, but our heroes along with so many new friends took full advantage of the opportunity.  and so, with celestic town next on their traveling calendar, ash and friends' exciting sinnoh region journey continues.    i'm not here.  aahhhh.   eieieieieieieieieieieieieieieither.  eieieieieieieieieieieieither.  eieieieieieieieieieieieieieieither .  susan:  i think you shou do they have a lot of sugar in 'em.  tons.  han dirt.  ooh. ah. gah.  ooh. ah. gah.  whole world changed one day when all these random cards started raining down everywhere.  at first they seemed harmless enough so a bunch of us kids invented this cool new game...  that's when we realized those cards weren't so harmless after all.  they were packed with incredible powers from another world.  my name is dan, and together with my friends, runo...  marucho...  julie...  not to mention mr. hotshot himself, shun...  and alice, we are...  the bakugan battle brawlers.  bakugan.  one goal... two worlds.  .

hungry...  someone's missing... julie...  julie must feel terrible.  yes of coarse she does...  i can't believe masquerade...  he got one of julie's childhood friends to be one of his battlers.  he's asking for it.    just go back to being your old self.  get off your high horse.  why billy.  why did you join up with masquerade.  why.  dan: looks like we've run out places to search for the infinity core...  i guess we're out of luck...  the caves we went to yesterday have collapsed.  so what should we do now dan.  let me think about this...  i know.  why don't we go check in on julie.  are you sure about that.  i don't know maybe julie wants some alone time right now.  hey what gives.  how come last night you were all so worried about her.   oh man...  it's no use runo...  dan just doesn't understand the way a young lady thinks.  that's because i'm a boy.   dan we need to talk now.  shun.  so did you find something.  yes i did.  there's a large canyon about 10 kilometers west from where you are.  it's very similar to the one that's in bakugan valley.  dan: really. great.  okay then let's go check it out.  meet you at the plane.  did he say it's similar to bakugan valley.  well, that's strange...  it doesn't look that similar to me...  hmm...  i wonder what shun is up to.  marucho: wouldn't it be great if we could find the infinity core out in that )
