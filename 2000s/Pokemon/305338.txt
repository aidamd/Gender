 blast it .  it's simply not scientifically possible for this not to have worked.  i think the only things he hears come out of his own mouth.  hey, you may call yourselves team rocket, but all i see are three goodfornothing bums without a job until i hired you out of the goodness of my heart.  complain all you want, but you won't get paid for it.  though he can hear the grass grow, i do wish he'd turn a deaf ear on our quips.  now hear this .  i'm sick of cleaning .  i just remembered i've got grocery shopping to do.  and i'll go with you.  hey, come back.  you can't leave me with mr. mess .   excuse me, jessie.  huh .  do me a favor and organize those papers over there.  over where .  sire.  magnemite.  haven't you two had enough of a staredown contest already .  pika, pika. piplup.  pikachu, i'm tryin' to talk to you.  pika, pika.  please, piplup.  are you getting sick or something .  piplup. pika.  we could try and pull 'em apart.  so, dawn, why don't you grab a hold of piplup, 'kay .  right, got it.  here we go.  and pull .   come on, let go .  yes, you're almost there .  a little more.   man, was that really nessary .  i really don't think zapping us solves anything.  pip, piplup.  pip, piplup .  pika .  lup .  pika, pika .  no use.  this sure is a big problem, no matter what's going on.  no duh.  what's gotten into them anyway .  hey, i think i've got an idea.  dawn, why don't you try putting piplup back into its pokball .  that's a great idea.  that'll force those two apart.  all right, piplup, return.  lup .  wow, that worked just like a charm.  sure did.  what the...  pikachu, what's wrong .  say something . pikachu.   piplup . piplup .  piplup came out on its own.  pika, pikachu .  piplup .  pika, pika .  here we go again.  oh, no.  that didn't work.  looks like it's back to the old drawing board.  really, brock .  you think this is a good idea .  of course.  when they first grabbed onto each other, even if we pulled them apart for a moment, as soon as we let go, they'd go rushing back to one another, like they had absolutely no control over what they were doing.  and then we'd pull them apart again.  and then they'd go rushing back again, as if they were behaving exactly like two magnets.  so like magnets, if we turn one of them around, they might pop apart.  i don't know, brock.  well, it can't hurt to give it a try.  come on, let's do it, dawn.  right with you.  and pull .   pika, pika.  piplup.  pikachu.  piplup, piplup.  let it go, pikachu .  give it up .  come on, piplup, let go .  pika .  that's it .  now turn them around .  pika. piplup.  perfect . we did it .  wow, who would've thought .  pikachu . piplup .  oh, man.  we gave it our best shot.  and after all of that work.  it looked so good at first.  yeah.  i was totally convinced that turning them around would do the trick.  now what do we do .  it'd better be good.  pika, pika. lup.  i think we'd better go and talk to nurse joy.  i'm sure she'll help us figure out what to do.  yeah, if anyone can help, she can.  piplup, pip, piplup. pika.  methinks twerps have invaded the forest.  me too.  did you get a load of the action down there .  no, just seemed twerpish.  well, this sharpclawed detective saw something interesting a'percolating.  care to elucidate . not now.  let's zip it for the moment and go keep an eye on the twerps' every move.  i want to know what's interesting .   check it out.  a squirtle and a raichu.   and look, a marill and a luxio.   and there's a mareep and an octillery.  what's this .  nurse joy.  my piplup and his pikachu are stuck together just the same way.  you guys, too .  their pokmon as well.  i brought it out of its pokball for a battle when all of a sudden, this stuff.  they're stuck together tight and they won't separate.  and when i try to get it to return, it just pops out again.  i don't know what to do.   nurse joy, please do something .  well, i'll tryi hope.  hold on . no way .  what's up .  there's pikachu and piplup, there's squirtle and raichu, then marill and luxio and mareep and octillery.  each pair is an watertype and an electrictype.  wow, come to think of it, you're totally right.  nurse joy, what other types of pokmon do you have here in the center .  just what you'd expect.  but these are the only ones who are stucer.  electrictypes and watertypes only.  what in the world could it mean .  i don't know.  though it could mean the professor's experiment's finally working perfectly.  this could be a groove...  or it could be a zero.  either way, let's book back to the lab and see what's up.  'kay, i think.  s chicken& stars soup, your mouth will blast off.  chickennstars    twinkle, twinkle    campbell'schickennstars    oh, what a rockin'soup you are    chickennstars    worth lickin'the dish for   wow.  campbell's chicken& stars soup.  out of this world.   quag...  sire .  magnemite .  if you don't say something to grouch puss, i will.  shh .  let's leave the factfinding to meowth.   professor kodama .  what is it .  see, i was wondering if the experiment you're currently conducting happens to involve making pokmon stick together.  ridiculous .  i'm not trying to just get them to stick together.  i'm trying to force them into being friendly with one another, fool.  what . oh, please.  shh .  hmm, so this device here is what you use to make that happen .   correct.  i've dubbed it "the affinity enabler." boy, there's a nifty name that just rolls off the old tongue.  hey, what was that .  it's beautiful .  the affinity enabler takes the pokmon move attract and converts it into a digital signal that is then transmitted using the antenna located on the roof.  when pokmon receive the converted signal, even the bitterest of rivals will change their attitudes quagsire and magnemite are totally mismatched for battle, which causes me to wonder why they act so bitter all the time.  sire .  magnemite .   stop it this instant .  magnemite .  quag .  see, i love them very much, so i have no choice but to figure out a method to get them to love each other.  well, i suppose i could increase the power.   piplup . pika .  now they're even closer .  oh, no, piplup and pikachu, are you two all right .  piplup . pika .  marill .  i sure wish i could figure out what's up with watertypes and electrictypes.  it's just so weird.  together they usually don't work well, but that's only during a battle, while at any other time they can be the best of friends.  hmm...  piplup.  what're you thinking of, brock .  i think it's possible what we're seeing isn't happening naturally.  what do you mean .  there's absolutely no way these two would be acting like this for all sorts of reasons.  no, the only way this makes sense is if someone is causing it to happen.  who would do that .  magnemite.  time to recycle that hunk of junk.  it has to work .  i won't give up.  i'll make them be best friends if it's the last thing i do.  'kay, so what's in it for us .  i say we swipe that bucket of bolts. huh .  when you consider the facts, this experiment's a success.  you two are so strange.  look, the twerps are all at the pokmon center where their pikachu and piplup are stuck to each other like airplane glue.  and there are scads of pokmon suffering the same fate.  pairs and pairs of pokmon plastered as one.  so how do you explain quagsire and magnemite .  that's the $64 question.  but once the ghosties are all gotten out of the machine, that thing's gonna be a real loveand friendmaking winner.  and that's when we swoop in an scoff it, dig .  uhhuh.  what do we do with that winner .  okay, what do you think would happen if pikachu and i were to become best buds .  no more battling .  that yellow pain in the neck's given us so much grief.  but since bffs play nice and don't fight each other...  then at long last we'll be able to catch pikachu, then give it to the boss and put this baby to bed.  i like what you said.  so for now, let's lay low and keep working for the prof until he works out all the kinks, thenwhammo.   not again .  curses .  my machine has stopped working altogether, thanks to you.  squirtle .  marill .  pika . pip .  they split.  wow, piplup, are you okay .  that's great.  looks like things are back to normal.  please.  can't you two behave so i can get this working .  pip .  raichu .  lux .  there they go again.  something strange is going on.  maybe... it's for the better.  huh . what do you mean .  well, if you really think about it, my raichu and your squirtle have never gotten along, even before they were ever battling.  i guess that's true, but...  no "buts." they'd always get into an argument that stopped 'em from even starting a battle.  knowing that, this could actually end up working better.  well...  is what you said true .  mmhmm. mmhmm.  hmm...  what, brock .  see, i'm thinking if this is a manmade phenomenon we're all dealing with, then wouldn't it also make sense that whoever caused all of this to happen would have pokmon that don't get along well at all .  in other words, whoever did this had a reason to cause this to happen so their pokmon would start getting along with one another.  professor kodama.  who's that, nurse joy .  professor kodama conducts lots of experimental pokmon research.  his research laboratory is located right behind the pokmon center.  so, nurse joy, you're telling us the professor has pokmon that don't get along .  right, quagsire and magnemite.  quagsire and magnemite.  waterand electrictypes.  can you take us there, nurse joy .  follow me.  have a very full life but my new dell laptophelps me multitask, so i can get more done faster.  plus, with windows 7 and home group it makes sharing photos,

what can i do for you .  have a look at this.  amazing .  they've been stuck together like this for a while.  this must mean my experiment's a success .  experiment .  that's part of it, right .  this is the key.  i engineered this equipment to bring pokmon closer to one another.  now, all my years of research have finally paid off.  quag...  magne...   why aren't quagsire and magnemite getting along .  yeah, they're waterand electrictypes, so why aren't they being friendly .  good question.  i'm working on that one.  that's strange.  so why don't you all lighten up .  we'll get there.  this is no place for amateurs, so why don't you all leave .   and you are .  why, we're professor kodama's welltrained assistants.  i don't remember any assistants.  we're part of the "jobs in a jiff" program.  anyway, back to the grind.  that demonstration proves it has to be working.  those twerpish dummies prove it's time to move this along.  and how.  hey, where do you think you're going, team racket .  i mean, team rocket.  there's nothing worse than a brainy big mouth .  except twerps with big ears.  all right, that's it .  we're busted, so off with my disguise.  there's lots of time left to feed you more lies.  on the wind.  past the stars.  my, how time flies.  bringing you chaos at a breakneck pace.  dashing all hope and putting fear in its place.  a rose by any other name's just as sweet.  when everything's worse our work is complete.  jessie. and it's james.  meowth .  that's a name .  putting goofy dogooders in their place.  we're team rocket.   and in your face.  wobbuffet .  it's team rocket.  what have you got up your sleeve this time .  forget up our sleeve.  we're taking that machine up in the air.  there. what're you doing .  two points .  from now on, just call me the sultan of strategy.  where do you think you're going .  professor .   excellent.  by accompanying us, the good professor can address any remaining techno issues.   hold it .  pip .  pika . pip .  that's awesome .  they're back to normal again.  pika . piplup .  pikachu. piplup.  man, this is nuts .   it helps to remember, "loser is as loser does."  and you're about to lose pikachu to the team rocket crew.   piplup, too.  pikachu, no .  piplup .  yes, a pikachu in the hand.  and it packs much less of a jolt without that thunderbolt.    what a dolt .   pikachu .  piplup .   i don't believe it.   is that magnemite .  magnemite.  now what .  it's trying to save professor kodama.  magnemite .   no, burned again .  pip.  sire .  sire .  what happened .  were you two trying to save me .  sire.  hey, i don't get it.  i thought those two couldn't stand the sight of each other.  so maybe they didn't hate each other after all.  maybe they were just having a little battle practice.  pika . piplup .  pika . piplup .  it's pikachu . and piplup .  they're both back to normal after the machine fell apart okay, staraptor, go on up and bring back pikachu and piplup safe and sound.  staraptor .  james, get them back .  they were great stuck together, but now i'm stuck with you.  staraptor .  seviper, right this wrong.  and, carnivine, you tag along.  pikachu, use thunderbolt, let's go .  and, piplup, use bubblebeam .  piplup, lup, lup .   your stupid strategies are about as slick as sandpaper.  look at the bright side.  when we want a killer thunderbolt or bubblebeam, we know just who to call.  i need those attacks like i need a hole in my head, which, thanks to carnivine, i have an abundance of .   we're blasting off again .   wobbuffet .   and after all we went through, it still didn't work on quagsire or magnemite.  maybe it's because quagsire's a groundtype as well as a watertype and magnemite is a steeltype as well as an electrictype.  that just might have had something to do with it.  you know, that might be it.  it looks like i now know exactly what my next research project will be.  so i'd better stop lollygagging and get to work.  and i hope it goes easier next time.  all's well that end's well.  don't you think, piplup .  lup .  you, pikachu . pika .  thanks to some clever deductive reasoning, quickthinkingand decisive action, a sticky situation hasbeen resolved.  and now for our heroes, their journey tosunyshore city continues.  captioned bysoundwriters ce 5 .  go.  . hot wheels battle force 5 .  . drive together to survive .  . fight. fight. fight.
