jon: so, liz, how did you and heather enjoy your trip to egypt.   liz: it was great.  the two of us had so much fun.  ] i've brought a couple of snapshots from the trip.   garfield: you call that a couple.  they have fewer photos on the internet.   liz: garfield, did you know that in ancient egypt, cats were worshipped like gods.  some of them were even embalmed and buried in their master's sarcophagus.   garfield: buried.  you call that worship.   liz: oh, and, jon, i brought you a little souvenir from cairo.  the old man who sold it to me at the market said it was an ancient artifact.  but i'm sure it's just a copy.   jon: wow. thank you, liz.  .   garfield: the man's excited by an old mirror.  hey, put some of that gratitude in feeding us all.  me, especially.   jon: garfield's right.  i'd better go get dinner on the table.   liz: okay if i help.   how about we play hideandseek.   garfield: how about if you hide and we don't seek.  ..2...   odie:  ..3...4...   garfield: i'll consider hiding when she hits 80 or so.  ..7...8...   odie:  ] huh.   ..13...14...   odie:  ..50...51...   ]  garfield: odie.  odie. come back.  come on, boy.  ..80...81...82...83...  ..  100.  garfield. odie.  i'm gonna find you.  now, where did they disappear to.    garfield: ugh.  ] ugh, oh.  as if i didn't have enough problems already.   odie:  ]  garfield: i have a feeling we're not in kansas anymore, odie, or anywhere else.  ] hey, would you be careful with those things.  i like my fur the way it is on a living body.   all: we are your humble servants, master.   odie: hmm.   this way, your excellence.   garfield: ah, this is more like it.  ]  odie:   bad jackal.   odie:   garfield:    i am neferkiti, high priestess of the goddess katra.   garfield: um, whatever you say.  more grapes, please.  and, uh, would you mind peeling them.   as you wish, great leader.   ahem.   garfield: you ahem'ed.   a long time ago, cats were not just worshipped by ancient egyptians.  catsruledover them.   men were merely our slaves, building us monuments and pyramids.   garfield: whoa.   but one day thousands of years ago, the men dared to rebel against us.  defeated, we were banished into another dimension through a magic mirror.   garfield: uh, could you skip to the end.  i never liked educational programs.     garfield:   according to an ancient prophecy, an orange cat and his pet jackal will appear one day.   garfield: jackal.   odie:   garfield: oh. you mean odie.   is that supposed to be me.   the orange cat shall become our new pharaoh, and we will worship him for 2,000 years.   garfield: you want to worship me and feed me.  who am i to deny my adoring public.   you shall have all you wish for as soon as we're done with the crowning ceremony.   garfield: good.  can we get it over with in time for lunch.     garfield: oh, boy.     garfield: hey, not so tight.  you want to stop my breathing.   no, that will come soon enough.    all: hail to our new pharaoh.  hail to our new pharaoh.  hail to our new pharaoh.  hail to our new pharaoh.   odie:   garfield: keep it down, odie.  you're gonna ruin my big moment of fame.   odie:   i, neferkiti, high priestess of the goddess katra, crown you pharaoh, my lord.   garfield:     i present you with those two symbols of your immortal dominion.   all: hail to our new pharaoh.  hail to our new pharaoh.   garfield: whoa.  that's enough grapes to last someone a lifetime.  for me, about an hour.   in the sarcophagus, an hour willbeyour lifetime.   garfield: what.  you never mentioned anything about putting me into that overdecorated phone booth.   didn't i. oh.  must have slipped off my mind.   see, our previous pharaoh was getting a little, um  garfield: oh.     garfield: hey, thanks for inviting me to be pharaoh, but i just remembered a previous engagement to not have my life ended.  ] )
