 cherubi .  yowzlers... cutie pie .  cutie, cutie, bless my soul .  makes me wanna rock and roll.  from now on, i don't care what kind of pain in the neck i deal with .  'cause now you're gonna smooth out the rough spots .  i must reward that also cute meowth and his friends, too, for cuting me up when i was going down .  we'll be the richest team rocketeers around .  riches abound . love that sound .   the coolest kids in town .  me and my big mouth .  now could any pokmon be cuter than you, cherubi .  cherubi .  excuse me, marilyn, but the battle's begun.  i just want to look at my cute cherubipoo a teeny bit longer, so go ahead and attack, dawny .  fine, thenglad to help you out .  buneary, use dizzy punch .  bun... eary .  cherubi .  that was the cutest fall i've ever seen .  awesome .  well, if you're not going to attack, we'll move things right along with ice beam .  buneary .  okay, protect .  cherubi.  cherubi...  it used protect, so the ice beam shouldn't have done a thing .  the agony .  no one can stand and take it any cuter than you .  but is that all you're thinking about .  i don't even think marilyn cares about battling.  piplup. pika.  hey, i think cherubi's putting on an act.  it shouldn't feel a thing while using protect.  if you're not going to battle properly, we'll stop .  this is just starting to get good, so you stay out of this .  stay out of this .  you have to, since i'm sure today's battle will be the world's most valiant pokmon battle the world's ever seen .   the most valiant battle .  uhhuh .  when i see a pokmon taking an attack, it gets me right here in the heart .  and then it gets me to feeling all warm and fuzzy inside.  i simply don't know of anything that's more valiant than that is .  it has to be the best thing ever .  that's battling .  it's nothing i've ever seen.  pika.  ash, pokmon battles are an art, and seeing a supercute pokmon stand up to an opponent's attacks and still battle valiantly, that's what it's all about .  why, this kind of ultimate battle is the most valiant experience one can have .  cherubi .  it isn't just valiant.  it's superdupermegamondocolossal valiant .  you're being inappropriate .  no, i am not .  look, in a pokmon battle, competitors perform to the best of their abilities by battling fair and square .  you should watch what you're saying, brocky, you're sounding like an old geezer.  brocky .  all right, the thing is you have to battle back or you won't be able to battle, so either you do what i say or i'll have to disqualify you .  oh, man .  i can't help it if he doesn't know what he's talking about, but i guess we have no choice.  all right, cherubi, time to battle back .  cher... cherubi .  now, use magical leaf .  quick, buneary, dodge it .  bun, bun, bun, bun .  bun .  no, buneary .  buneary's down .  now, tackle .  cher... cherubi .  buneary...  buneary, you can do it .  dizzy punch . dodge it valiantly .  bun, bun, bun .  solar beam .  cherubi .  bun .  buneary, no .  not only is buneary megacute, but it battles way more valiantly than i thought.  now it's time to show me lots more of that valiant spunk .  buneary is unable to battle, and that means the winners are cherubi and marilyn .  i wanted to see more of buneary's valiant spirit, but instead i overdid it, and now it won't be a valiant battle .  well, i'll say thisit was unique.  man, what kind of battling was that .  it looked like marilyn couldn't have cared less whether she won the thing or lost it .  so does this mean that's all there is .  no, this is not right .  it's a cocoa smashdown.  to win post cocoa pebbles cereal.  part of a good breakfast.  bulk wins.  but not for long.  bam bam bam.  nothing beats the big chocolaty taste of the little pieces.  ..  meowth, that pokmon is primed for poaching, so make up a machinemush .  with what dough .  if my wallet was flatter, it'd need a back brace .  we don't need a machine when all we need is a dollop of pokmon cuteness .  so we put forth one of our admirably adorable pokmon for battle and then beat her at her own cutesy game .  carnivine, bring out that cute face .  the face is cute, but are the teeth necessary .  big, green and toothy ain't cute.  wait, what about mime jr. .  it's that kinda levelheaded thinking that makes your critics wrong most of the time .   valiant battling can sure make a victorious girl hungry for lunch .  are you marilyn, perchance .  yes .  hi, my name's jessirilyn .  let's battlewith my supercute pokmon .  supercute pokmon .  where, where, where is it .  come on out, cutie .  mime, mime, mime, mime, mime, mime .  are we talking cute .  okay, it hasn't evolved, and itisless than two feet tall, but that red nose is such a cute faux pas .  it wouldn't ever make it onto my cutepokmon list .  mime, mime, mime .  sorry, maybe some other time.  well, she's not onmylist, either.  forgive me .  i never should've let jessie talk me into allowing you to be used as bait .  well, back to the old drawing board .  oh, man .  i don't think i'll ever understand that marilyn .  pip, piplup, piplup .  i don't blame youshe sure does her own thing.  pika, pika.  i've decided to battle her next .  why .  i can understand a pokmon's cuteness being one of its strong points, but this just doesn't sit right with me.  i don't want marilyn to judge a pokmon based on its looks .  what's important is the bond created between pokmon and trainer, and when that's accomplished, any pokmon can shine as brightly as possible.  wow, you're so right .  now you go set that marilyn straight .  yes, i will .  hmm...  sudowoodo .  croag .  me, battle against them .  that's right, take your pick .  excuse me, brock.  don't you think you're pushing it a little bit .  yeah, marilyn didn't even thinkpiplup was that cute, remember .  hey, as far as i'm concerned, both sudowoodo and croagunk are as cute as they can be .  right, i know just what brock means.  hmm... nope, no can do.  don't you have any other pokmon that are cute .  i do have another one.  great, i knew you had a cutie in there .  but this pokmon hasn't even participated in any battles yet.  well, i can already tell that this pokmon's supercute .  come on, show me, brocky .  all right .  happiny .  wow, it hasn't evolved yet, it is shorter than two feet tall, and is supermegacute .  aww, i'll battle with you .  aww... hap, hap, happiny .  your call, happinywanna battle marilyn .  happiny . happiny's in .  but i want sudowoodo and croagunk in there, too.  let's have three matches .  i guess so, that's okay with me.   ahem, ref for hire, get your official ref .  i'm an official pokmon center battle referee .  anyone need a ref .  what perfect timing .  would you be the referee for our pokmon battle, please, sir .  thought you'd never asksure .  just like clockwork .  as soon as her cute pokmon are pooped out, we move in .   all right, this will be a threeround battle with no pokmon substitutions .  so battle begin .  cherubi, come out cutely .  sudowoodo, let's go .  cherubi, cherubi . sudowoodo .  doubleedge, go .  sudo... woodo .  valiant .   will you stop getting excited over your pokmon's taking damage .  a battle is supposed to connect the hearts of a trainer and their pokmon .  oh, brocky, geezer time .  well, if words can't convince you, i'll just have to show you.  sudowoodo, use mimic .  sudowoodo...  sudowoodo...  use fake tears, too .  sudowoodo...  isn't that admirable .  it isi'll give you 200 points .  now you see this proves every pokmon is cute and has an admirable side, too .  you're right, very valiant .  although in the cute department, i'd give it a zero points out of ten .  well, she got part of it, but i still can't figure that girl out.   okay, referee, do something about this .  yes, ma'am .  i guess we need to see what other pokmon the girl has.  since this match is going nowhere fast, i hereby declare it a tie .   huh .  up.  the for honey nut cheerios will finally be mine.  not if i can help it, yellow jacket.  ugh...keep him busy boys i don't think so.  ugh. mmmmmm.  ugh. yummy. yummy.  well that backfired a little bit.  i'll get that honey yeeeeeeeeeeeet.   the honey is safe this time...  ...for honey nut cheerios.  part of this good breakfast.  reme and i are still recruiting for team xtreme.  anyone who joins has a chance to win some of thisawesome gear.  looking good team.  no purchase necessary.  many will enter,few will win.  ask your parentspermission.  com woodo, return.  cherubi, return valiantly .  now, round two, begin .  croagunk, you're up .  croag.  chingling, come out cutely .  chingling... chingling.  boy, i can see why marilyn has that one .  piplup . pikachu .  and the cuteness just keeps on coming.  bet the third one makes me sick .  quick, croagunk, poison jab .  chingling .  now, poison sting .  ching, chingling, chingling .  now that's... valiant .  now, brick break .  chingling .  ching, chingling...  it's just like a fairy tale .  beauty battling the big, bad beast .  will you stop goofing around and start battling .  pishposh, whatever.  chingling, attack valiantly for me, using growl .  now use confusion .  chingling .  is croagunk unable to continue .  no, waitcroagunk can still battle .  croagunk, get up now .  get up, you can do it, croagunk .  i know you can do it, croagunk, so just do it .  croag .  so... valiant...  now you see .  when a trainer and their pokmon's hearts truly unite and become one, any pokmon, regardless of their looks, is admirable .  all right, on with the match .  use brick break .  chingling .  ching, chingling .  chingling is unable to battle .  croagunk gets the win .  chingling, return valiantly .  croagunk, return, too .  thanks for battling so hard.  do you see .  the important thing is the bond between a trainer and their pokmon.  brocky, geezer time .  but i admit, i hear you now.  i think marilyn's changing her attitude .  with marilyn's first and second pokmon as cute as buttons, her third pokmonmust register completely offthe cute chart .  and now time for the third and final round .  get ready for a cute pokmon to end all cute pokmon .  i'm ready to melt .  time out, just a sec .  huh .  what's going on .  i'm going to use you.  i'm back .  i've never ever used this pokmon in a battle before, but now i think it's a great idea .  huh, what do you mean by that .  okay, i've always thought this pokmon was the cutest ever.  people used to tease me all the time about how weird they thought i was for thinking that way.  so after that, i've been wrapped up in catching pokmon that i knew everyone would think are cute as well.  you see .  i see it now...  but, brocky, you taught me that it doesn't matter what people think .  now, my darling, come out cutely .  shellder .  ahh .  that slimy shellder's her cutest pokmon .  it's a nightmare .  this is handsdown my most megacutest pokmon .  don't you think shellder's tongue is the most charming thing ever .  i wonder if brock really got in there after all .  'course, after all this, i'm not so sure.  i'm sure she gets it, even if just a little .  shellder, huh .  that hard shell gives it a powerful defense.  if this gets drawn out, it's gonna be one tough battle.  all right, happiny, let's go .  happiny .  happiny, i know this is your first battle .  i'm counting on you .   let's win this for sure, shellder .   down we goexcuse us .  puhleeze...  if you think the boss is gonna swing with a shellder, you're nuts .  and who are you two .  they're part of team rocket, and they're bad guys who steal people's pokmon .  since cherubi and chingling are the cuties, we'll steal them .  here they are .  what's a referee doing in my purse .  he's one of team rocket, too . huh .  not a great entrance, but what an exit .   stage right .  shellder, quick .  use brine to catapult yourself .  shellder .  give us back those cutie pokballs .  okay, shellder, use ice beam .  shellder .  happiny, use poundgo .  happiny .  why do things end up like this when we're much more admirable than the twerps .  tell them that .  least i'm the megacutest .   megalooniest .  not cool .  great, wow, thanks, shellder .  you're the mega, mega, mega, mega, megacutest .  looks like we finally got through to her.  although beauty is in the eye of the beholder, a pokmon's cute appearance isn't what's important.   it was hard to be honest with herself after being really hurt by all those things her friends said.   any pokmon can be cute, for sure .  pikachu . piplup .   dawn, your package has arrived .  thanks, nurse joy .   who's it from .  it's from my mom .
