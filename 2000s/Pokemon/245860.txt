fire fang.  wait, how come dane's points just went down .  in a pokmon contest battle, the successful use of a flashy move can lower your opponent's points.  i see, that's amazing.  only in contest battles.  quick, dodge it and use ice shard .  mamo .   and fire fang misses.  mamo .   after a quick dodge, mamoswine unleashes ice shard.  let 'er rip .  mamoswine has just eaten its own ice shard.  go for it, mamoswine .  pika .  mamo .   unbelievable .  mamoswine's fur has just frozen over and its body is covered in icicles.  it's as if mamoswine were wearing ice armor.  that did it .  look how their opponent's points went down.   mamo .  we're on a roll, mamoswine.  all right, now hidden power .  mamoswine .   and hidden power makes mamoswine's ice armor sparkle brilliantly.  that's beautiful . lup .  yeah, and by combining those moves, dawn's making mamoswine look even more fearsome.  take down .  mamo .  uhoh, dodge it .  swine .  granbull .    that's it .  and the team of dawn and mamoswine moves on to the semifinals.  mamo .  wait, that's it .  the battle's over .   using triplecombination move of ice shard, hidden power and take down, mamoswine masterfully takes the match.  man, that was a letdown.  letdown .  but, dane, in case you didn't notice, mamoswine won.  mamoswine was into it, but that was only in the beginning of the battle.  and since it was actually won with take down alone, i bet dawn wishes she could have done more.  brock's right, it's true.  there were a lot more things i wanted to try.  but a win is a win, right .  yeah, but i think dawn wishes she had won the battle in a different kinda way.  contest battles are more complicated than i thought.  yes .  so i'll just make the semifinal battle flashier .  piplup .   folks, it's been one stylish contest battle after another and your applause shows me how much you love it.   the first semifinal match will be between...  dawn on my left and jessilina on my right.  and with dawn having won four ribbons and jessilina having won two, who will win the contest battle and move on to the final round .  it's all up to you, james.  we've got five minutes on the clock.  begin .  mamoswine, spotlight .  mamo .  carnivine, showtime .  not chow time, showtime .   and once again jessilina puts everything into her performance .  mamoswine, ice shard .  mamo .   mamoswine's powerup fails.  pika . lup .  no way.   and carnivine's quickmoving vine whip has stolen mamoswine's ice shard.  now there's a slick trick.  that jazzy james.  does this mean we might pull this baby off .  mamo .  return that ice shard to sender .  carnivine .  mamoswine, dodge it .  mamo .   and mamoswine gets pummeled by its own ice shard.  mamo .  well, it appears mamoswine is getting all fired up.  please, mamoswine, calm down .  mamo .  wait, mamoswine .  mamo .  mamoswine making a move without dawn's command is bad news.  mamoswine, chill out . pika, pika .  mamo, mamo, mamo...  jump and dodge it.  mamoswine .   carnivine elegantly dodges over and over while mamoswine is getting more and more upset.  mamoswine, watch your opponent's move, please.  mamoswine .  carnivine, now twirl and dance.  keep them in a tipsy trance.  they don't stand a chance.  yeah, show those yahoos who wears the pants.  carnivine.  mamo.  mamoswine, you've got to calm down .  it's like mamoswine can't hear dane talking.  even with my untrained eye, i can tell mamoswine's moves aren't normal.  i'm afraid carnivine's totally in control.  mamo .  don't attack unless i tell you to.  swine .  carnivine, bullet seed .  carnivine .  mamo .  swine .  mamoswine, you've got to listen to me .  mamoswine .  mamoswine, stop .  carnivine, use vine whip to grab mamoswine's tusks.  carnivine.  and now pull back .  carnivine.  mamo .  mamoswine . yeah.  lup . pika, pika .  quil .  come on, mamoswine, get a grip .  i can't watch anymore.   mamoswine.  mamo...   all right, time's up.  and the team moving on to the final round is...  jessilina and carnivine.   carnivine, we're in .  carn, carn, carn, carn .  i love you too, but i still need to use my head .   eureka .  mamo...  cheer up, mamoswine.  come on, there's next time.  and when that time comes, we'll be in better synch, right .  mamo.  dawn . dane .  piplup .  hi, guys.  sorry about your match.  lup. quil.  hey, no need to worry.  maybe you should have used piplup and another pokmon after all.  you might be right, but there are a lot of things you don't know until you're actually up on stage.  one thing's for sure, ash.  i know what mamoswine and i have to work on after today, you know .  hope you're okay with being our practice buddy some more.  sure . pika .  dane, you lost, but you're so positive in spite of it.    tyrogue has run out of points.  so the final stage winner and lilypad champion is jessilina.  jessilina .  wow, she really won.  and now mr. contesta will present jessilina with the lilypad ribbon.  behold .  the lilypad ribbon.   one more time .  do the math.  three ribbons. i can count.  thank you you're in the pink.  that's called the ribbon cure, silly.  i love you, my ribboneypoopsiewoopsie.  this jess was worth the wait.  one minute.  i'm not pleased that you as me got more applause than i as me.  so what do you have to say for yourselves .  i say dumb luck, perhaps .  james's a dummy, all right.  well, i want to be adored like that, too .  i'll never get sick again.  'cause i'm jessilina, top coordinator.  i've got the look you want to know better.  well, it was fun and we're still in one piece.  long as our girl keeps laughing, we keep staying alive to see another day.  yay .  wobbuffet .  here you go, mamoswine.  eat up 'cause starting tomorrow you and i are going to practice even harder, okay .  mamo .  piplup. cynda.  wow, mamoswine's really stoked.  pika.  we'll do whatever we can to help you win a fifth ribbon.  thanks, brock.  i'll do my best.  what do you say .  yeah. pikachu.  nice.  at times like this, isn't it great to be with friends .  you're right, khoury.
