 that's yahoospeak for making us do the heavy lifting.  now, gible, let's start with rock smash.  gib...  togekiss, use sky attack now.  toge...  kiss .  huh .  toge .  whoa, what's with the sky dancing .  toge .  hey, dawn, what's going on .  if i knew, i'd tell you, believe me, brock.  gible .  kiss .  gible .  gible...  hey, gible, are you all right .  gible.  that sky attack was really powerful.  pika. piplup.  kiss.  it's the epitome of grace in flight.  give me .  gible, dragon pulse, let's go .  gib...  dragon pulse is a powerful move, so be careful.  pip, piplup .  i know, but this's my first time with a flyingtype pokmon.  uh, togekiss, dodge it.  gible .  togekiss did it.  well, it was raised by princess salvia.  this's no time for me to think about that.  gible, gible.  now's our chance.  togekiss, use aura sphere .  toge, toge .  what're you doing .  toge, toge.  come on, togekiss, hurry up, please.  all right, gible, while you've got the time, use dig.  gible .  toge .  hurry, togekiss.  you're too slow.  kiss .  gible .  i guess we were too late.  gib .  gible .  yeah, gible, great job .   with all that prancing around, togekiss gave gible the perfect chance to get away.  what do i do .  kiss.  wow.  a dodge with grace.  this is no time to start up a fan club.  still waiting for a strategy from you, 'kay .  sorry.   there's an idea ringing in my brain.  quick, togekiss, use air slash.  not again.  toge.  gible, are you okay .  gible.  okay, it's gonna have to be all or nothing.  gible, draco meteor, go .  gible .  piplup .  pip, piplup .  piplup, piplup .  piplup, piplup .  whoa, what a smash .  pika.  gible .  piplup .  togekiss just protected piplup.  lup .  kiss, toge.  gib.  gib .  gib .  do you get the gist of their jive .  see, togekiss's asking gible if it's really piplup's pally or not.  and if so, what's with the bad big bang boom .  even in the face of anger, it's got style.  now it's a warning to never, ever let it happen again.  togekiss's not only graceful when airborne, but it's also gracefully gifted with social skills as well.  highbrow, like i am.  kiss, kiss.  pika, pika. gible.  pikachu. piplup.  that's all for this battle.  guess you're right.  we'll try draco meteor later, 'kay .  gible...  toge... kiss.  togekiss's carefree but it's tough as well.  like a big sister, don't you think .  yeah.  gible, that was great.  you deserve a good rest.  you were something, togekiss.  wow . kiss .  pika, pika .  thank you for protecting piplup, too.  piplup . kiss.  toge .  pika, pika, pikachu.  pika .  dawn, what's wrong .  piplup.   i'm glad togekiss helped piplup, but...  i'm thinking i really don't understand togekiss all that well.  you don't .  i'll tell you, togekiss sure impressed me.  i guess you're right, but...  i'm still confused.  i know what dawn means.  togekiss did that loop right before the sky attack and took a long time before the aura sphere as well.  it was like togekiss was trying to look good before launching all of those attacks.  yeah, come to think of it, you're right.  with all that beautiful flying, there's no doubt in my mind that togekiss will do really well in the first round on the performance stage.  but after that... who knows .  with so much time between your command and togekiss using the move, it's not going to be easy to battle.  but look at it another way.  you and togekiss are brandnew to each other.  once you're communicating better, i'm sure everything will turn out just fine.  brock, i sure hope you're right.  hey, you've got plenty of time to get all of this squared away.  you just keep on with your training and i'm sure it'll all work itself out.  yeah, ash is right.  okay.   tada .  whenever times get tough, time for simple stuff, you dig .  and simply put, while the twerps break for lunch, we'll dig it.  shoveling our way to steal some success.   yes .  leg stop.  beep beep  .   newdouble dares fruit flavored snacks.  almost there.  twerps totally targeted.   pika.  piplup.  pikachu .  pika, pika .  pika .  pika . piplup.  pika, pika . piplup .  they're sure having a good time.  togekiss is really great at taking care of all the little ones.  togekiss, time to come down soon, okay .  pip, piplup.  pika, pika.  piplup, are you all right .  piplup...  kiss, kiss.  pip, piplup.  now, time for more training.  that's it.  remember, togekiss was raised by princess salvia, which is why it's second nature to show off that grace.  in a battle situation, it may look like unnecessary movement, but it's simply part of togekiss's upbringing.  wow.  so that's why working with togekiss has been such a difficult thing for dawn.  yeah, but we'll never be able to win a battle in that case.  togekiss.  now, togekiss, please.  you know speed and timing are crucial in a battle, right .  kiss, kiss.  dawn, just train hard.  no need to worry.  pika, pika.  lup.  you're right.  okay, let's try one more time.   second time's the charm.  this dig for sure.  so drill, digger.    man .  what was that blast .  blast .  don't use a loaded word like that.  foul. foul.   team rocket .  we just drilled ourselves twerpside, brainiac.  how am i supposed to aim in that washout .  curses.  no shovel means no shoveling.  stop .  enough groveling.  time to rely on team tenacity.  what're you talking about .  we want the world and we want it now.  twerp interference, we won't allow.  on the wind.  past the stars .  whiz, bang, pow .  bringing chaos at a breakneck pace.  dashing hope, putting fear in its place.  a rose by any other name's just as sweet.  when everything's worse, our work is complete.  jessie.  and james.  meowth, that's a name.  putting the dogooders in their place.  'cause we're team rocket.   and we're in your face .  wobbuffet .  look, twerpette, i know you're at wit's end, so prepare to have togekiss taken off of your witless hands.  what did she say .  whatever you want, forget it.  blathered like a true twerp.   seviper, enlighten them.  seviper .  carnivine, enlighten them, too.  not "enbiten," enlighten, twit.  seviper, poison tail.  seviper .  carnivine, vine whip .  carnivine .  togekiss, get out of there .  your twerpish advice falls on deaf ears.  yanmega, after togekiss.  yan, yan .  mega, yan.  togekiss, no .  why don't you leave this to us and you go and take care of togekiss .  it's a deal.  sudowoodo, let's go.  sudowoodo .  sudowoodo, use doubleedge.  sudowoodo .  quick, pikachu, use thunderbolt .  pikachu .  togekiss, sky attack, now .  kiss .  togekiss .  toge.  toge.  not again.  togekiss, there's no reason for you to have to loop like that.  so stop .  toge .   sonic boom, yanmega.  show the twerps how it's done.  yan, yan.  follow that feat with silver wind.  yan .  togekiss, quick, dodge that.  now quick, circle around.  toge .  toge .  togekiss, use aura sphere.  toge .  now, yanmega, use steel wing.  yanmega.  toge .   look out .  toge .  togekiss, straighten up, come on .  toge .  togekiss, hurry and straighten up .  please .  togekiss.  that's it.  o > yanmega, gloom and doom with sonic boom.  yan, yan.  togekiss, do your dance.  huh .  it dodged .  hey, sonic boom, instant replay.  yan, yan .  togekiss, style and grace.  kiss.  toge.  check it out. wow.  oh, the beauty.  it's like a ballet recital in the sky.  but my sole purpose is to catch togekiss, not compliment it.  quick, yanmega, use sonic boom once more.  yan, yan .  dodge it with style and grace.  toge.  toge.  toge.  in your face with style and grace .  yanmega, silver wind again .  right now .  yan .  togekiss, ride the wind.  yan .  now use air slash with grace.  toge.  fly, yanmega, like the wind .  yan, yan.  togekiss .  kiss .  kiss .  are you okay .  toge .  all right, return.   jessie .  man, those twerps beat the pants off of us and i don't even wear pants.  come back, you two.  'kay.  i guess it's time for plan "z." piplup .  pika . piplup .  pikachu . piplup .   well in hand, meowth.  and those velvet gloves add a nice touch.  it's like i always say, "be prepared for a lastminute get away." perhaps this should've been the plan since minute one.  oh, lighten up and have fun.  yeah, after all, we did poach pikachu and piplup.   up, up, up .  pikachu .  piplup .  pika, pi .  piplup .  togekiss .  piplup .  piplup .  kiss .  horrors .  outta plans, let's scram.  not so fast .  pikachu, thunderbolt, go .  piplup, use bubblebeam, and, togekiss, use aura sphere .  pikachu .  piplup, lup, lup .  togekiss .  we're fresh out of plans again.  when we do our sky dancing it's klutzy, but why .  being a klutz just might have something to do with it.  wobbuffet .   we're blasting off again.  awesome, pikachu, you were great .  pika .  piplup and togekiss, you were wonderful, too.  piplup .  togekiss .   that quick air slash togekiss used while sky dancing went in so many directions, yanmega couldn't dodge it.  so when did you figure all this out .  i got it during the battle.  those extragraceful movements togekiss used were really meant for my eyes.  togekiss showed me how best to use those graceful skills.  so that's how it happened.  togekiss has a unique way of doing things.  but i think the problem was i didn't realize that until now.  so no need to worry.  you two make a great team, for sure.  pika . lup .  and the timing couldn't be better, since it's off to the grand festival.  what do you say, togekiss .  toge.  the bond between trainer and pokmon is allimportant, as demonstrated by a happy dawnand her togekiss.  and the grand festivalwill prove timing is everything.  captioned byundwriters . let's fight an epic battle .  . faceoff and spin the metal .  . no time for doubt now . )
