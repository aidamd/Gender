 u out with catching your very first pokemon.   wow. thank you.   huh.   staravia. star star star.   staravia spotted yanma.   all right.  all right, pippy.  bubble, go.  ..lup lup lup.   yan.   now use peck.   lup.   yes.   that's it, tyler.  keep it up.   okay.  now, pippy, use pound.  ..  piplup.   looks like tyler's getting the hang of it.   sure does.   piplup piplup.   that's yanma's quick attack.   tyler, intercept it.   right.  use peck one more time.   pip lup.   yan.   now, tyler, the poke ball.   and make it a good throw.   all right.  go.  huh.     oh, no.   is that the sound of negativity, i hear.   bummer bantering rings loud and clear.   on the wind.   past the stars.   in your ear.   bringing chaos at a breakneck pace.   dashing all hope, putting fear in its place.   a rose by any other name's just as sweet.   when everything's worse our work is complete.   it's jessie.   and it's james.   meowth. that's a name.   putting the dogooders in their place.   team rocket.   all: in your face.   team rocket.   time to throw the game.  underhand.    what.   love when twerps do all the work,  all: then we get to play.    and i was just about to make my first catch.    tyler.   pip. pip piplup.   no luck, huh.   team rocket's gotta be around here.   well, the problem is there are a lot of lakes and ponds around here.  and they could all be connected under water.   i can't believe what team rocket did, stealing someone's firstcaught pokemon.   and after trying and trying to catch yanma for the p  hey, don't do that.   huh.   you can't quit after one defeat.  your journey's just started.  believe me, you're gonna have to deal with lots harder stuff than this.   don't worry.  you stick with it, and i'm sure you and your pippy are gonna be just fine.   yeah, this is certainly no time for you to give up.  it's true once a pokemon's captured, that's that.  so now's the perfect time to set your sights on a new pokemon.   yeah.   another yanma.     hey, why not go and catch .   great.   dawn: tyler, wait up.     all: that's what we call a dishonest day's work.   poaching preweakened pokemon conserves energy.   doing our part to make the world a bit greener.   and the sooner we pass it on to the boss, the sooner we stop taking a loss.   over the river    and through the woods    to boss' house we go    ah. it's here.  team rocket's delibird.   ahoy delibird.   point that beak down here.   cleared for landing.   easy does it.  ..  you lose this, you lose everything.   dee dee dee.  dee dee. dee dee deee.   give it to the boss with my compliments.   and my compliments, too.   if you know what's good for your.   all of our past getrichquick schemes, and we finally come up with a plotzproof plan.   throw enough spaghetti against the wall, and something's bound to stick.  and nothing's stickier than success.   by using repetitive motion to beat the odds, we're becoming the sinnoh slickers we were destined to be.   staravia.   you lost track of yanma, didn't ya.  it is gettin' dark.   maybe we should just call it a day for now.  don't ya think.   mmhmm.   this is the first time i ever camped out.   and wait'll you get a taste of the way brock cooks.   there's nothing like traveling with a good friend who's a great chef.   pika pika.   i see.  oh.   awesome.   i told you.   piplup piplup pip.   these are the gym badges i've gotten in the sinnoh region so far.   these are great.  ash, good for you.   and take a look at the pokemon contest ribbons i've won.   wow.   contest battles have their own unique style, and they're fun, too.   sounds cool.  i was planning on competing in gym battles, but pokemon contests sound great, too.   hey, tyler, how'd you like to meet my pokemon now.   and mine, too.   me, three.  .    yes, sir.  i'd be tickled to serve as your sinnoh region chief.  it's all so wonderfully sudden.   when the boss offers james seconds, james always says yes.   i know just what the boss'll say next.  "it's the least i can do to make meowth and friends stinkin' "  yes, what.   a package, special delivery that looks like it's from a jessie, james, and meowth.   jessie. and james.  and meowth.   team rocket operatives based in the south sinnoh region, i believe.   hmm.  here, my dear persian.  like that.  what is it.   it's a pokeball, sir.     poke ball contents yanma.  it's useable moves wing attack, quick attack, sonic boom, and ancient power.   our supply.   sir, we recently acquired a large number of yanma.     what shall we do, sir.   let's see.   tyler, today that yanma's gonna be yours.   all right.   piplup pip.   all done.   what's done.   what better way to attract that yanma, than by mixing the kind of fruit it loves into some pokemon food.   wow, brock.  that's a great idea.   i don't ever recall witnessing such a magnificent morning.   i'm gonna grin my whiskers off.    i could drink the air.  a perfect day to celebrate the satisfying feeling of a job well done.   deli deli, deli deli.   delibird at 11:00 o'clock.  voila.  thanks.   this appears to be from team rocket headquarters.   maybe it's a thank you gift from the boss.   riches, here we come.    all: huh.   i'll bet you dollars to donuts, the boss was so yayyayed over that yanma we sent him, he sent us a power pokemon in return.   hidden within this pokeball, lucario or rampardos, perhaps.   the suspense.  i can wait no more.  out here on the double.   yanma.   huh.   will you get your haunches out of my hair.   yanma.   again with that head thing.   either they all do that or this is the yanma we gifted the boss with.   why would he spring for the return stamp.  of course.  see, being such a benevolent boss, he decided to give us a great gift for giving him a great gift by sending us the same gift.  get it.   gobs of greedy business world bosses, but our boss is golden.   putting his teammates' needs ahead of his own.   the big guy can make you cry.   so, since i'm the catcher in this pokeball game, i think it should be mine.   that sounds fair and fine.   but it somehow feels like the boss got the short end of the stick.   in that case, i'll simply catch an alternate yanma earmarked exclusively for the boss's private stock.   cool.  james, you rock hard.   lup.   now, tyler, throw your pokeball, quick.   right.   hold it, twerps.   come on, not you guys.   that's denial.  yanma, let's go.   yanma.   when it comes to yanma, life is much better in pairs.   not even you guys would try that again.   tyler deserves to catch that yanma, and that's what's gonna happen.   chimchar, i choose you.   chimchar.   now, yanma, wing attack.   yanma.   dodge it, chimchar.  use flame thrower.   chim char.   what do you twerps think you're doing flaming our gorgeously gifted yanma straight from the boss.   it's that sort of insensitivity that needs to be repaid in spades.   you best get prepared to dig deep  'cause i'm digging deep, too.  feast on my fury swipes.   carnivine, action.  one headhugging pokemon is enough.  use bullet seed.   carnivine.   all right, yanma, use sonic boom.   yan.   dodge it, and use flame wheel.   char.  char.   oh, no.  it's improper etiquette to grill a gift.     yanma's using ancient power.   chim char.  char.   uh, excuse me.   i think yanma's starting to evolve.     let's see.  why, that's a yanmega.   joy.   yanmega.   pokedex:yanmega, the ogre darner pokemon.  when it flutters its wings, it creates a shockwave that can cause internal damage to its opponents.   right.  yanmega, let's try sonic boom.   char.   aw, chimchar.     yes.   some smackdown.   let's roll.   right.  ..  ..   flint.     so since when did team rocket get good.   who knew.   oh, man, i goofed it up again.   it looks like our yanma two flew on the wing.   so now yanmega's our thing.     i just had my hair done.   hey, that's the bosses gift you're dissing.   wait.  in order for a yanma to evolve into a yanmega, it needs to know ancient power.  so when could yanma have learned such.   i know.  i'll wager the boss must have thrown in teaching yanma ancient power as a bonus for us being us.   wow.   to think he'd give those extra props for his peeps.   no doubt, we've ascended to his alist in a big way.   i really feel the love coming from that man.   like a wave.   and we're his goto gang.   okay.  we'll utilize this magnificient yanmega to manacle a mass of headhugging yanma for our beloved boss.   yeah, we're turning that wave of love into a tsunami and sending it back.  cinnamon part of thisgood breakfast.  crave those crazy squares.   huh.  it worked.   yan.   brock's special yanma food's working like a charm.   all right, tyler, now.   okay, let's go.  pippy, pound, now.  ..  piplup.   yeah, that's the way.   huh.   ohoh.   hi.   not to rain on your pathetic parade, but that yanma has the boss's name on it.  go be losers somewhere else.   ash: oh, yeah, how are you gonna make us do that.   pbbttt.   all right, i've had enough.  buizel, let's go.   bwee bwee.   yanmega, treat those twerps to your ancient power.   oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.   dodge it, buizel.  now, buizel, use aqua jet.   bwee bwee.  bwee.   the boss' gift'll shrink.   okay, buizel, sonic boom.   bwee.   if yanmega's not permanent press, i'll sue.   you're not stoppin' tyler again.  now, pikachu, use thunderbolt.  ..chu.     say, we could email a picture of yanmega to the boss to show him how well it's evolved, you know.   yeah, that would kick up our already first class credentials with him up another notch or three.   though we are presently .  but when it's with yanmega, it's a real blast.  ]  they're not gonna be bothering us for a while.  'kay, tyler, you ready.   sure am.  let's go, pippy.   pip.   all right, pippy, bubble, quick.  ..lup lup lup.   yan.  yan.   dodge, pippy.   pip.  pip.   yan.   pip pip pip lup.   look at that.  that's even faster than when piplup's in the water.   pippy, use peck.   piplup.   wow, way to go.   yanma.   now, pippy, dive.   awesome.   quick, pippy.  bubble, let's go.   pip lup lup lup.     it's working. great.   all right, pippy, use peck.   piplup.   yan.   pip piplup.   great.  now, throw your pokeball, quick.   right.  okay, pokeball, let's go.     we'll see.   come on.   mmm.  ]    tyler, one more time.   yeah.  now, pippy, use peck once more.   pip. piplup.  pip lup.     throw it.   right.  and this time's a keeper.     ah.   you did it, tyler.   yeah.  i just caught a yanma.   piplup.   i did it. i did it. i did it.  i did it. i did it.   wow, your first catch.   congratulations, tyler.   yeah, that was such a great battle.   pippy, you really gave it everything you've got.   pip piplup. piplup.   piplup piplup piplup.   and i'll take good care of yanma for sure.   all: mmhmm.   i'm heading over to lake valor.   hey, you take good care of yourself.   here's a little something for your trip.   wow, thanks, brock.  that's so nice.   sure.   good luck with your gym battles, ash.   hey, thanks.   and good luck winning your next contest ribbon.   thank you.   i really think you should find some buddies to travel around with.  you know what i mean.   yeah.  and find someone who can cook like brock does, too.   that sounds like a plan.   okay, see you again some time.   take care of yourself.   yeah, take care.  just think about all the new friends and great pokemon tyler's got ahead of him.   you're right.   as for us, let's give it everything we've got.   you bet.   pikachu.   narrator:and so, having once been brandnew trainers themselves, our heroes can continue happily on their own journey knowing they've made a measurable difference in 1g1 ul inn.  e, meaning "empty han e world changed one day when all these random cards started raining down everywhere.  at first they seemed harmless enough so a bunch of us kids invented this cool new game...  that's when we realized those cards weren't so harmless after all.  they were packed with incredible powers from another world.  my name is dan, and together with my friends, runo...  marucho...  julie...  not to mention mr. hotshot himself, shun...  and alice, we are...  the bakugan battle brawlers.  bakugan.  one goal... two worlds.  . what are you going to do. .  . the odds are stacked against you .  . back against the wall .  . gotta give it your all... .  . ah ha ah ha .  . this is the final stand .  . ah ha ah ha .  . the power's in your hand .  . two worlds collide .  . on the inside .  . you gotta fight for what's right .  . before it's gone, gone, gone .  . this is bakugan. .  the bakugan battle brawlers in a combination battle.  dan: aw don't be a wimp runo.  let's do extreme mountain next.  i want to ride the ferris wheel.  extreme mountain.  the ferris wheel.  oh whoopee.  a big wheel that goes round and round.  whatta blast.  just because it doesn't go up and down at a 100 miles an hour doesn't mean it won't be fun.  yeah it'll be boring.  well i've got six tickets in my pocket.  how many do you have left.  no you wouldn't...  ah.  i guess you shouldn't have wasted your money on all those gnarly corndogs...  i'll share my tickets if we go on the ferris wheel first.  you are so brutal.  i knew this would turn into a snooze fest.  you spent your whole allowance.  you've been stuffing your face with junk food all day...  you've got no money left.  you want to get to on extreme mountain you be nice to me.  a corndog...  i bought you a corndog, that's gotta be worth something.  a corndog.  listen up buddy.  we're going to go on the ferris wheel next.  if you want any of my tickets do as i say.   ...there they go again.  these humans are indeed a curious species...  exteme mountain.  ferris wheel.   what's happening over there.  awesome.  ladies and gentlemen can we have two volunteers for our next illusion.  anybody out there interested.  yo. right here. pick us.  you two.  come on up here.  oh yeah.  here we come.  tadah.  we'll start with a card trick.  go ahead pick a card, any card.  right...  which one should i choose... .  dan... pick a card...  come on buddy... i don't have all day.  chill... i'm thinking.  i... pick this... ...card here.  a doom card.  that's twisted.  yeah ya know why.  masquerade's behind this.  you're right...  allow me to introduce myself and my brother.  i'm kenta.  i'm kenji...  you're runo right.  and you must be dan kuso...  masquerade says you're the one to beat.  you up for a battle.  always...  dan, i can handle these two.  what.  this is all a set up by masquerade...  he's watching you and if you take part in this battle )
