garfield:  here we go again.   wouldn't it be easier to just buy her dinner.   jon: can i help you hold your stethoscope.   liz: jon, there's nothing wrong with garfield.   garfield: see.  she knows.   liz: nothing except his weight, of course.   garfield: what doyouknow.   liz: which reminds me i'd better see how he's doing in that department.   2 more pounds, and i'll need a forklift to do this.   garfield: hey, sarcastic remarks aremyjob.   liz: whew.  you're going to inaugurate my new stateoftheart animal scale, garfield.  jon, would you turn the dial to "portly pussycat".   jon:  "portly pussycat," just as you asked.   ohh.  get off me, you overweight tub of pasta and goo.   garfield: aah.  yikes. that thing talks.  and it screamed at me, and it's rude.   liz: oh, i forgot to tell you.  this is a talking scale.   come back here, you bucket of lard.  i wasn't finished with you.   garfield: oh, my.   liz: garfield's heavier than i thought.  it says he needs to lose 2 pounds right away, by the end of the week, if possible.   jon: and if he doesn't.   liz: then i think we have no choice but to send him to the cat spa.   garfield: whew.  the cat spa.  that sounds great.  massages, long naps, more massages, more long naps.   liz: they'll put him on a strict lowfat diet.   garfield: and then "strict .  this lowfat diet i can still eat lasagna and pizza and porkfried rice and bacon wrapped in bacon, right.   liz: here's a video of the place i had in mind.   welcome to maggie's cat spa, the world's leading health resort for lazy, overweight cats with attitude.   when we brought hector to maggie's cat spa, he was eating 12 meals a day.   well, he, uh he got so fat that when he had to walk from the living room to the kitchen, he took a cab.   but thanks to maggie's cat spa, this is all behind us now.   well, uh, look at hector now.  doesn't he look positively healthy and alert.     at maggie's cat spa, your beloved pet will be placed on a strict regiment of exercise and diet.   jon: garfield can't go to that place.   garfield: yeah, listen to jon.  he's right for a change.   liz: either he loses 2 pounds by the end of the week, or it's the cat spa for him.   garfield: aah.   liz: here, take the scale home with you so you can monitor his progress.   jon: i'll do my best to slim him down.  do you think you can do it, garfield.  garfield, that's liz's lunch.   garfield: hey, watching all that exercise made me  hungry.    jon: dinner's ready, garfield.   garfield: i want lasagna and ribs and chinese food and chocolate cream pie and roast beef with a side of roast beef and third helpings of my second .  hey, what's this.   jon: enjoy your lettuce leaf, garfield.   garfield:    gee, i was expecting food.   jon: i put him on that strict diet you recommended, liz.   garfield: you know, these things aren't half bad if you cover them in whipped cream and chocolate sauce.   jon: uh, i'll call you back, liz.  let's see where we stand now.   hey, you gained another pound.  niceoing, fatso.  a few more ounces and you'll qualify for your own zip code.   jon: see.  now you have to lose 3 pounds.   garfield: i'll worry about it in the morning.   jon: i don't know what will have to happen to get him to take this seriously.   garfield:  jon won't send me to that fatcat place.  even if he did, it wouldn't be so bad.    ..  ..   let me out.  please. let me out.  i don't belong here.  it's all a big mistake, i tell you.  i'm not overweight.  i just have very thick thing of fur.   i wouldn't do that, if i were you.  nurse psycho doesn't like it when we scream in terror.   garfield: nurse psycho.   you don't want to know what she did to the last fat, obese cat that complained.   garfield: what did she do.   let's put it this way.  it was me.   garfield:  help. help. jon.  or better still, someone competent.  help.  wait.  i have to get a grip.  this nurse psycho couldn't possibly be that bad.   where's the new fat cat.   possibly be that bad.   there you are.  have you been screaming in terror.   garfield: whawho, me.  oh, no.  i was practicing my yodeling.  here, listen.  yodelayheehoo.   we're gonna get you

exercising as soon as you finish.   garfield: as soon as i finish it.  okay, well, uh, here goes.    mmm.    my compliments to the chef.   now it's time for your workout.   garfield: what. wait.  i need time to digest that huge meal.    up. down.  up. down.  up. down.  up. down.  now repeat for the rest of all eternity.   garfield: no.  i must have lost 2 pounds by now.   sorry, pal.  you're
