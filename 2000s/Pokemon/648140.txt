 you have to try and be nice to them instead .  so what's your name .  thomas.  so, thomas, put yourself in the pokmon's position.  you wouldn't want to be teased now, would you .  same goes for pokmon.  all right, i hear you.  i know.  guys, i think you should get to meet a lot more pokmon.  great idea.  okay, how about we bring out a bunch of our pokmon .   yay .  sudowoodo . happiny .  torterra . monferno .  buneary . cyndaquil .   that's more like it.  so let's get to know some pokmon.  but be nice to them, okay .   okay .   the excitement at the neighborly town pokmon contest is real and growing .  our next coordinator is none other than the entertaining and unpredictable jessilina .  and don't forget gorgeous .  all right, seviper, rocket start .  seviper .  on a roll like this, i'll soon be experiencingfourth ribbon bliss .  if jessie were any more pumped up, she'd spring a leak.  it'll be raining a fourth ribbon soon.  you're so right .   pokmon breeding is all about taking the best care of your pokmon that you possibly can, making sure they're happy and healthy.  pip...  lup...  wow, you feed 'em pokmon food, right, brock .  right, but giving your pokmon pokmon food is just one part of the process.  breeders adjust the diet and flavor for each one.  if you find they aren't eating enough, you simply change things around a bit.  by doing that, you maintain your pokmon's good health.  so then, how do you tell if a pokmon's healthy or not .  the easiest way is to check their luster, and if their body isn't as smooth or healthy looking as you like, it could be a sign they might not be feeling very well.  what about them .  they're healthy because they're looking great.   piplup, piplup .  you've gotta admit, piplup, your face looks a whole lot better now .  oh, no .  piplup's got a mustache .  'course it would be thomas.  piplup's having a bad day.  and then, my pikachu and gible battled with each other, but i just couldn't catch gible at the time.  after that, gible followed us.  hold on, did i really catch gible .  well, anyway, gible and i are together and that's what really matters.  isn't that right, gible . gible, gible .   'kay, gible, return .  gible .  and check this, this is a pokball.  pika, pika .  after ya have a pokmon battle with 'em, you use this to catch 'em .  no big deal.  all trainers have at least one of those.  well, i guess you're right.  so why don't we all get practicing .  good idea .  now, let's pretend that target marks a pokmon and try to hit it.  i wanna, i wanna .  yeah . cool.  okay, let's use this rubber ball for practice.  right.  piplup .  and you'll pick 'em up.  now, give it a shot.  and go .  pika .  pi.  pika .  awww, i missed.  man, this is hard .  keep practicing and you'll be able to hit it.  who's next .  me, me . here you go, good luck.  and here's the wind up, and go .  piplup .  man, you almost had it.  oh, well.  okay, i'll show you how it's done.  see, you gotta pose like this first.  you don't really have to pose before you throw it.  nope, ash's pumped up, you know what that's about.  this is how you toss it .   awesome .  and that's how you catch a pokmon.  then, you make a final pose"i caught a pokmon ." pi, pikachu .   that's easy, man.  thomas, why don't you give it a try .  pika.  go .  piplup .  piplup...  piplup, piplup, piplup, piplup...  thomas, no .  hey, don't get mad at me since you told me to throw it.  thomas sure loves to joke around, doesn't he .  but why tease just piplup .   time to eat.  wow, yummy.  thank you.  brock has to be the greatest chef in the world.  thomas, how is it .  uh, it's okay.   well, isn't that... nice.  brock made a whole bunch, so have as much as you like.   yay .  one more round to go, and this baby is mine .  our jumping jessie is on fire .  yeah, jess's on a slow roast to victory .  so get ready, dawn, you're up next.  the next class is for coordinators.  hey, what's wrong, dawn .  i'm worried about thomas, that's what's wrong.  i just hope i'll do a good job.  hey, thomas just likes to pull practical jokes.  no need to worry, you're fine.  i hope you're right.  dawn, just do your best and you'll be okay.  maybe...  ..  to the toothpick factory.   ..  a danimals vip field trip.   one lucky winner and their classmates ..  come on.  including free rides, look inside any specially marked

could win $50,000 and be a sears style maker.  com a pokmon contest has two roundsthe performance stage and the contest battle.  a coordinator needs to decide what kind of performance style they're going to use and what moves they'll be using as well.  your pokmon is always the focus.  everybody with me .   yeah .  round one's where a coordinator shows off their pokmon.  see .  sorry, but i don't have a clue what you're talking about.  say exactly what you mean, 'kay .  uh...  you show off your pokmon's cuteness, how's that .  pokmon's cuteness .  yeah, right.  this'll be much faster if i just show you .  mamo .  cynda .  all right, watch closely .  now, i'll show you what a combination looks like.  cyndaquil, use flame wheel .  daquil .  mamoswine, use ice shard .  mamo .  awesome . pretty .  cyndaquil .  i call this flame ice, 'cause it's a flame in ice.  cynda, cyndaquil .  thomas, how's that .  it's all right.  stubborn.  okay, i'm going to use the same move but with a different pokmon this time.  different pokmon . hope it works.   cyndaquil, return .  pachirisu, come on out, now .  pachi, pachi .  tadathis time it's pachirisu.  cyndaquil's move was with fire, but this uses pachirisu's electricity, which will make the ice sparkle.  and, i call this move ice chandelier .  ice chandelier . ice chandelier .  mamoswine, ice shard .  mamo .  now shatter it .  swine .  whoa, awesome .  pachirisu, discharge .  it worked .   wow .  what happened .   come on, that wasn't a finished move.  besides, pachirisu's totally standing still inside the ice.  so it's boring to watch.  guess maybe you're right.  hey, what's the matter, dawn .  thomas was right when he told me it's not a finished move yet.  hi, brock.  ice chandelier isn't going to be an easy move to master.  yeah, maybe you should start over and come up with a whole different combination.  yeah, except i really like ice chandelier and want to make it work.  i wonder if it can even be done.  not only that, pachirisu's totally standing still inside the ice.  of course.  yes .  i think i know how to make it work this time around.   okay, listen up.  this is the real ice chandelier.  first off, mamoswine will shatter ice shard with its tusks.  next, the shattered ice shard will surround pachirisu.  oh, so it's just the same thing as before.  this is where things change.  thomas, your comments turned out to be excellent advice.  they did .  before, pachirisu used discharge while standing still.  this time, pachirisu is going to spin during discharge.  that way, the ice should sparkle more beautifully than you can imagine.  no need to worry, because i'm sure it'll work this time .  sounds good, it's worth a shot.  yeah, let's see how it turns out.   ha ha. wheeee.  hey, ronald. come on, let's go play.  oh, i wish i could, but i have to go to work.  bye. bye, ronald.  .    okay, here i am at work.  now we can play. woohoo. yay.  . ba da ba ba ba .  whoa. wahahaha.  e, use ice shard .  mamo .  mamoswine, shatter it with your tusks.  swine .  now for the show .  pachirisu, discharge .  it's discharge .  think it'll be able to spin .  spin right where you are .  faster, pachirisu .  looking good. pika .  oh no.  man, that was close.  you know, it's a good idea, but pachirisu needs to be able to spin a little bit more for it to work.  you okay .  and i was so confident it would work.  maybe spinning inside the ice isn't gonna cut it.  you can do it, dawn .  pachirisu's still pumped and raring to try it again.  pachirisu, wanna take another shot .   don't waste your time.  come on now, who wouldn't become dizzy from all of that spinning .  no matter what you try, it's useless.  thomas, you may be right.  of course .   and she's done it again .  the winner of the neighborly town pokmon contest is none other than jessilina .  and now for a comment from the judges' table, please.  seviper's haze was simply beautiful, and its execution of that poison tail was nothing less than exquisite.  first rate .  and jessie makes a slam dunk for ribbon number four .  then to the grand festival with one more .   a perfect score .  wobbuffett .  buneary, it's your turn .  go .  buneary .  you're using buneary instead of mamoswine .   what exactly are you up to . pika, ka .  just you watch.  buneary, use ice beam and surround pachirisu, now .  buneary .  use ice beam until a ball of ice forms around pachirisu .  buneary .  just like she said.  piplup .  what's dawn trying to do .  of course .  the air pocket in mamoswine's ice shard was really small, so pachirisu got dizzy from all of that spinning while all it could do was spin, but now, with buneary's ice beam surrounding pachirisu, there's no need for pachirisu to spin.  pachirisu can just run inside of that ice sphere.  dawn, that was good thinking.  all right, pachirisu, use discharge while running .   come on, you can do it, pachirisu .  all right .  go for it . just a little bit more .  yeah, all right .  piplup, piplup, piplup .  do it .  pachi, pachi, pachi, pachi, pachi, pachi, pachi...  that's it .  wow .  pretty .  it worked, it worked .  amazing, amazing .  lup .   she did it . pika, pika .  dawn tried but could never quite make it work by using ice shard.  by switching to ice beam, it works beautifully .  pachirisu, we did it.  buneary, thanks so much.  and thanks, thomas.  where's thomas .  yeah, and where's piplup .  pika, pi . huh .  piplup .  pip, piplup .  pip, piplup .  lup, piplup .  piplup .  what is going on with them .  that's what that was about.  thomas must've really liked piplup right from the start, but just didn't know how to say it.  so in thomas' frustration, the only thing he knew how to do instead was to tease it.  of course . pikachu .  piplup, piplup .  thomas, i want you to know that i mastered ice chandelier because of your advicethanks a lot.  i'll tell you, that ice chandelier of yours is really pretty.  you think so . mmhmm.  it'll work great in the contest.  thanks, thomas, i'll do my best .  piplup, i'm so sorry i teased you like that.  piplup .   how was the neighborly town contest, johanna .   i'm happy to report that jessilina put on a really fantastic performance and ended up winning .   that must mean jessilina's working hard, too.  and here's neighborly town's specialty, neighborly sweet buns.  wow, thank you so much .  so, dawn, it sounds like you're getting really good at combinations.  yup . i'm so glad you're working hard.  and thank you all for subbing for me in class today.  you saved me.  we had a
