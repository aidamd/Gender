 e is a group of very bad people after me.  you'll protect me, woplease, brock .  protect you .  protect me, yes.  i have to travel to the other side of that mountain.  you'll take me, won't you .  what're you talking about .  you can't expect us just to say yes.  excuse me, i'm not asking you two.  what was that .  please, brock, let's go.  what's there to think about, brock .  she'll be fine if she goes there by herself.  but if marley's being chased by bad people and we were planning to go over that mountain anyway, then why not help her, too .  then it's settled.  the she goes again.  i agree.  let's go together.  good.  so where are you headed after you cross that mountain .  to a very secret garden.  secret garden .  what's that .  i can't say any more than that.  oh, man.  why are all these bad people after you .  it's because i'm an alien.  an alien . you're kidding, right .  i'm kidding.  come on .   piplup .  piplup, i'm thinking you're hungry.  piplup . pika, pika .  you too, huh, pikachu . pikachu .  i have some pokmon food i made earlier.  please, brock, i am in a rush.  now just a sec.  it won't take long.   piplup .  pikachu...  i'm going for a walk.  don't walk too far, okay .  you can come out now.  min, min.  shaymin .  you've got to be starving.  it's pokmon food.  eat it.  shaymin.  but you've got to eat.  you haven't had a thing all day.  shaymin.  she's been gone awhile.  wonder what she's up to.  let's go look.  shaymin.  shaymin, hey, what's wrong .   hey, it's a shaymin .   shaymin, the gratitude pokmon.  when the gracidea flower is in bloom, its pollen allows shaymin to change into its sky forme from its land forme.  shaymin also have a tendency to migrate.  that shaymin looks awfully weak to me.  it's been like this since this morning.  why didn't you tell me sooner .  let me see.  what's wrong .  pika . piplup .  piplup . pika .  okay, it appears to have been exposed to poison of some kind.  poison . that's right.  there's a move called seed flare that shaymin can use which will take polluted air and then purify it.  i think some of that poison could still be in its body.  now that i think about it, shaymin absorbed a seviper's haze this morning.  but what can we do .  i'll use a pecha berry.  this will rid shaymin of any lingering toxins.  here, eat this.  min...  min .  piplup .  that's it.  next we'll use a sitrus berry.  it'll help you get your strength back.  wow, shaymin . awesome .  shaymin looks so much better .  that's a relief.  you know, brock, it's almost like you're nurse joy.  well, that's because brock wants to become the world's greatest pokmon breeder.  but you're keeping shaymin inside of a picnic basket.  why .  sadly, i have to keep it hidden since the bad people are all after shaymin.  huh .  all the people in the world and she had to get tight with twerps.  dealing with those dopes definitely drags down our stealing style.  team rocket never gives up or in.  no witless twerp can come between our shaymin and us.  after the allnighter we just pulled, no doubt we've earned it.  oh, yeah, and this allnighter was a nosleep safari.  check out the walking shock of greenery.  what do you know .  that green shock's a shaymin .  shaymin ranks high as a really rare primo pokmon.  which ranks really high as a primo gift for the boss.  of course .   yoohoo .  min .  min . who are you .  a bad dream .  yanmega, use sonicboom .   are you all right . shaymin .  we've earned that shaymin, so hands off .  it's finders, keepers and losers, losers .  this shaymin doesn't want to go with you.  your ribbon's on too tight .  who are you anyway .  the best .  the crme de la crme.  we're the best while they're just them .  on the wind .  past the stars .  i'm such a gem .  vanishment .  well, not for long .  they're such bores.  you've got the annoying traits of a twerp .  unacceptable .  arcanine.  use flamethrower.    we're blasting off again .  there isn't a blast off big enough to banish team rocket.  there's a new and improved team sitting in our back pocket.  and stealing shaymin's the first thing on the docket.  wobbu .  i get it, that's what happened.  so shaymin's been with you ever since .  that's right.  i tried once to say goodbye, but, well...  i know you go on a flower bearing journey, isn't that right, shaymin .  if i remember coy, the gracidea flower garden is just past that mountain.  shaymin .  yes, the flowers are all in bloom right now, so you better hurry.  you should go, or you won't make it in time.  min.  later that night, i was having trouble falling asleep.  huh .  shaymin. shaymin .  huh .  shaymin.  all right, you win.  we'll go to the gracidea flower garden together, then.  min .  wow, shaymin, you're so warm and cozy.  shaymin.  and then, this morning...  tada . not you three again.  we've been foraging the forest for you all the livelong night .  hand over shaymin and we won't bite.  i won't .  arcanine .  you lose .  seviper, use haze and make it hazy.  seviper .   thank you . no, shaymin .  shay...  hey, shaymin's using seed flare .  beware .  min .  shaymin .  arcanine, let's go .   no .   show yourself .  not a trace.  she's gotta be in the forest .  to the forest .  the forest . the forest .  well, it all makes sense now.  but you don't have to worry about a thing anymore, 'cause you're with all of us.  pikachu . piplup .   the gracidea flower garden should be just beyond this tunnel.  shaymin . then let's go.  they're headed to the gracidea flower garden, as we thought.  and, surprise, we'll be there.  when those dumb dopes get a load of the robot waiting for them, it'll knock that ribbon right off of that sleepy twerpette's noggin.  wobbuffet .  .  i got a gusher that didn't gush .   we have a gusher that didn't gush      swim for it.  huh. what.   uh. ohh.  ooh.  ohh.  ha ha ha.  you are slimed, brother.  and now, brother, you are slimed.  nice to see swimmington loosen up.  yeah. he should get slimed more often.  flavor blasted goldfish crackers.  always baked and really cheesy.  . the snack that smiles back .  goldfish.  have a gusher that didn't gush slow it down i got it, i got it     oh thank you robot child   pika .  piplup .  piplup .  pip, pip, pip, pip, pip...  piplup .  shroom, shroom, shroom .  piplup, piplup...  that shroomish is using poisonpowder .  min.  shaymin, min .  shaymin's seed flare is purifying the poison in the air.  min .  shaymin .  pikachu . piplup .  piplup . pika .  they're still feeling the poisonpowder .  hang in there, pikachu .  min, shaymin, shaymin .  min.   it's shaymin's aromatherapy.  pika .  no more poison. thank you, shaymin.  yeah, thanks a lot, shaymin.  piplup . pika, pika .  lup .  shaymin, min .  look up there.  we're almost at the end of the tunnel.  after we get out, there should be a vast gracidea flower garden.   min .   it can't be.   the blooming season must be over already.   hold on .  we might be able to find a flower that's still blooming if we look.  pika .  i think we should all split up and do just that.  lup .  hmm.  hmm.  there's gotta be a blooming flower.  all we need is to find just one.  then shaymin can use it to transform into its sky forme.  and then onto its flower bearing journey.  pika, pika. min .  lup .  huh .  up there .   you found it .   way to go, brock .  shaymin, there's still some left.  shaymin .   excellent work on our behalf .  it's team rocket .  no, not them again.  i should've known it was you three after marley and shaymin.  i'll say this, you're persistent.  like night follows day.  we have to be in order to keep up with your persistently dimwitted twerpish shenanigans.  so now, let's catch that shaymin with a string shot spectacle.  pikachu, use thunderbolt and stop team rocket, now .  piplup, use bubblebeam .  pikachu . piplup, lup, lup .  torterra, use energy ball .  torterra .   bah .  we hit the ground running.   or crawling, as the case may be.   metacaterpie rocks like me .  hey, dawn, how about using ice beam right under them .  great idea .  all right, buneary, use ice beam .  buneary .  buneary .  your turn, torterra, use rock climb .  piplup, use whirlpool .  torterra .  piplup .   we did it . terra .   they did it all right.  show them what they've won, meowth.  you've won a form change.  it's our blockbuster, butter free .  since it's not really an evolution, we've saved maximetapod for later.  so try our robohyper solarbeam on for size.   huh .  shaymin, where are you .   marley .  shaymin's up over there .  . .  . .  . .  . .  ..   it's all that cinnamon and sugar that makes those crunchy little squares so irresistible.  part of this good breakfast.  crave those crazy squares.  to the toothpick factory.   ..  a danimals vip field trip.   one lucky winner and their classmates ..  come on.  including free rides, look inside any specially marked danimalsto see if you won or with yourparent's permission go to danimals.comfor free means of entry.  many will enter,one will win.  .  danimalicious.  .  and, piplup, you use bubblebeam .  pikachu . piplup, lup, lup .  they missed .  we win .   from way up here, those twerps really do look like the microminiminds they truly are.  before we steal away with shaymin, what say we give the twerps a blastoff payback .  robohyper solarbeam.  dig it, jack .  pika.  shaymin, you can do it.  min...  it looks like shaymin's form change has begun.  shaymin .  it's shaymin's sky forme.  min .  shaymin.  shaymin .  min .  shaymin, yeah . awesome .  that's sin's sky forme and i'm fuming.  the idea of sacking us while we're gassing up is just plain ruder than rude .  everything shaymin does is as predictable as twerps being stuck on stupid, so catch it.  right, piece of cake.  min .  min .  shaymin .  min, min .  ) meowth, me for our new move.   one robohyper gust, what a groove .  shaymin .  shaymin .  the flower .   game's over, pally.  shaymin .  shaymin's using air slash.  shaymin .  slice and dice.  to be halved on the brink of success.  that would have been my guess.   we're blasting off again .   wobbuffet .  min.  shaymin.  no, shaymin's getting weak lying on top of all that cold ice .   min .  shaymin's back into its land forme.  what do we do .  team rocket blew away the last gracidea bloom.   shaymin, shaymin .   min .  min, shaymin .  wow, you've got friends here waiting for you.  min, shaymin .  min.  min .  shaymin .  min .  min .   shaymin, the time for you to go on your flower bearing journey is now.  min .  by nightfall you'll transform back into your land forme, so you need to find a different flower garden before that happens.  shaymin, min .  and maybe we'll get to meet each other again someday.  so until then, it's time to say goodbye.  min.  shaymin, min .  see you later .  bye, shaymin .  take care, shaymin .  make sure you make a beautiful flower garden, shaymin .  bye .   i just heard shaymin's voice speaking to me.  wow.  it said "thank you." shaymin is gratefully off on its flower bearing journey, thanks to our heroes.  and with anotherrare and wondrous pokmon as a new friend, our heroes' own journeycontinues.  captioned bysoundwriters )
