 ms. senior wipes the floor with that jerk .  huh .   reggie .  hey, paul, how's it going .   and it looks like the entire sinnoh region...  reggie .  wow, it's true .  who's that guy .  that's paul's big brother, reggie.  he's a breeder down in veilstone city.  have you gotten past the snowpoint gym .  coming soon.  well, keep in mind that candice is tough.  i've got a plan for her.   reggie .  would you look at that .  wow, it's been a long time .  yeah, it really has .  it's great to see you.  what're you doing here .  i just finished bringing a pokmon i was watching back to its trainer.  you challenging the snowpoint gym, too .  yeah, i battled candice yesterday and won the badge .  really . awesome.  hey, hear that, paul .  that's great, huh .  okay if i come watch your battle .  whatever you want.  man, that guy paul may be the total opposite of ash, but he's absolutely nothing like his brother, either.  for sure.  pip .  what's that .   what's that .  piplup .  it's the battle pyramid . pika .  wow, you guys know about that thing .  yeah, i finally beat it, but it took me a bunch of times.  what . you beat it .  tell me that's not the battle pyramid.  i'd be lying if i did, though from kanto, it's quite a haul.  even flyboys need a change of scene.  wobbuff .  wow .  transmission from the snowpoint city pokmon center.  hey, brandon, long time no see .  it's ash from pallet town .  i'll beso how are you, kid .  ash, did you say battle pyramid .  yeah, it was the final facility ash challenged back in the kanto battle frontier days.  the battle frontier, that's, uh...  it's a group of facilities somewhat like a gym but more intense, where you challenge and battle against an amazing group of powerful trainers called frontier brains.  brandon is the most powerful kanto frontier brain, and everyone calls him the "pyramid king." reggie, didn't you challenge him, too .  i remember seeing the frontier symbols on display in your house.  yeah, but i never got the brave symbol, which is proof of winning at the battle pyramid.  that's right, brock told me.  so why did you stop battling .  because i learned one thing.  that i have a lot more to learn.  what a nice surprise.  it's been much too long, brandon.  great to see so many familiar faces.  if i remember, you're reggie's younger brother, right .  so you do remember me.  i'd like to challenge you to a pokmon battle.  right here and now .  battle .  incredibleit's the real battle pyramid .  ms. senior .  and it's so huge .  sorry to cause such a fuss, but i'm brandon, the pyramid king of the battle frontier.  i'm honored to meet you .  i'm candice, the snowpoint gym leader.   huh .  oh, it's you, maria.  we've been waiting for you...  pyramid king.  i'd like to introduce you all.  everybody, please say hello to temple maiden maria.  it's an honor.  ahh .  with a beautiful maiden like you, i must make a pilgrimage to the snowpoint temple right away, or bust .  no fairi haven't even left yet .  zoey, there's a temple here .  oh, yeah, the snowpoint temple.  it's a bit far from here, but it's an ancient temple with a rich history.   that sounds awesome .  temple, she says .  rich, she says .  history's out, money's in .  wobbu, wobbu .   you see, my purpose in coming to sinnoh is to investigate the snowpoint temple.  of course.  you do research on many ancient civilizations, right .  correct.  but i never imagined you were going to travel here in your amazing battle pyramid.  it appears we've caused a bit of a scene.  now, sam. sir .  please go on ahead with maria to the temple.  what about you .  take a look.  look into his eyes.  how can i refuse the battle this young man requests .  i'll catch up with you soon.  thank you, sir .  but, paul, why now .  'cause i have to do what you couldn't.  and that's that.  hey, brandon, it would be really great if you'd let us watch your battle.  young man .   huh .  i don't care.   brandon, i could referee .  why . there's no need.  huh .  it's a full sixonsix battle.  pokmon exchanges allowed.  the battle will be over when all six of one side's pokmon are unable to continue.  very well.  paul wants to do what reggie couldn't.  he's gonna tryand beat brandon .  . .  . .  . .  . .  ..   it's all that cinnamon and sugar that makes those crunchy little squares so irresistible.  part of this good breakfast.  crave those crazy squares.   professionals need to perform under pressure.  . .  and pressure can cause anyone's deodorant to fail.  . .  introducing gilletteodor shield antiperspirant.  unlike regular deodorants, it targets and neutralizes odorat the source.  help eliminate odor,don't just cover it up.  . .  gilletteodor shield antiperspirant.  also try odor shield technologyin new body wash.  . .  magmar, stand by for battle .  magmar .  regirock, i need your assistance .   regirock .   regirock, the rock peak pokmon.  regirock's body is made of rock, and if something chips off in battle, it attaches rocks to repair itself.  so brandon starts with regirock, just like he did with my brother.  i remember paul was watching.  of course, that was back when my pokmon and i were defeated by brandon.  paul was a new trainer and had just gotten his turtwig.  he had gone to kantoduring his sinnoh journey because he wanted to watchmy battle.  i had already gonefrom league to league, and i felt ready to challengekanto's battle frontier.  so to becomea frontier brain, i had one more challengei needed to face, and that wasa battle against brandon.  but...  we lost without defeatinga single pokmon.  no .  you challenged me, and i truly did enjoy our battle today, but the fact remains that your battling style is little more than neatly put together .  now where is your true inner strength .  wow, what about my inner strength .  hmm...  so the reason paul's so obsessed with power is because of what happened to reggie.  all right, i can handle anything you bring, because that's my battling style .  magmar, return .  return .  what's with paul .  they haven't even started .  paul must have decided that his firetype magmar wouldn't be strong enough against brandon's rocktype regirock.  hariyama, stand by for battle .  hariyama .   hariyama, the arm thrust pokmon.  hariyama can send a truck flying with its powerful arm thrusts.  a fightingtype.  that's a good choice.  let's begin.  stone edge, now .  quick, block it .  you know rocktype moves won't have much effect on hariyama .  is this a test .  you'll have to see .  arm thrust .  hari .  hari, hari, hari .  hold it down .  oh, no . now, shock wave .  even after damage from the arm thrust, regirock has that much power .  force palm .  use focus punch .  hari, hari...  it's unable to battle .  that regirock's tough.  what power . pika .  i remember climbing this, happily hunting for untold treasure .  let's do it again for the good times .  there was nothing good about the first time.  say, let's do a temple trek.  by the time we finish traipsing to the temple, i'll be too old to remember why .  well, i suggest a battle between you two to decide our preferred course of evil action.  hey, don't you have an opinion .  at the risk of bragging, nope .  mime, mime .  all right, the fate of our future plans is in our hands .  i've got paws .  to the temple if i win .  to the pyramid if i win .   rock, paper, scissors, shoot .  bet i make you look .  electabuzz, stand by for battle .  electa .  why choose an electrictype .  of course .  it makes total sense paul would do that .  brick break .  i knew he was gonna use brick break, too .  well, brandon's regirock is a highlevel pokmon and paul knows it, so of course he's got to use an attack that'll be a powerful match.  stone edge, go .  protect .  even protect wasn't strong enough .  now, hyper beam .  i can't believe how easily he took out paul's electabuzz.   pika .  good, regirock, return .  after using hyper beam, a pokmon can't act right away, so it's good he's making an exchange now.  registeel, i need your assistance .  registeel.   registeel, the iron pokmon.  because registeel's body has been tempered by underground pressure for thousands of years, its body cannot be scratched.  a registeel.  magmar, stand by for battle .  magmar .  firetypes have the advantage over steeltypes.  use flamethrower .  mar .  a direct hit . pika .  but how .  it must've had an effect, but it's hanging in .  use iron head .  block it and then willowisp .  magmar.  magmar's scared .  where's the willowisp .  iron head may cause opponents to flinch and then it prevents them from attacking.  now, nidoking, stand by for battle .  nido .   nidoking, the drill pokmon.  one swing of its mighty tail can snap a telephone pole as if it were nothing but a matchstick.  nidoking is a poisontype, but i thought poisontype moves don't work on irontypes, isn't that right .  that's true, but nidoking is also has groundtype moves, which are effective on irontypes.  we'll have to wait and see which moves he calls.  use flash cannon .  earth power, now .  well, that's some impressive strength.  double kick .  whoa, a hit like that and registeel's still up .  now use thunderbolt .  iron head, go .  nidoking's out now as well .  it was a good attack, though.  all right, what's wrong .  and here i thought you wanted to beat the man who defeated your brother .  the truth is it's only because you defeated reggie that my victory over you will have meaning.  the challenge you always present to trainers to find their own strength was something my brother wasn't able to do .  but i'm not like my brother .  my will gives me strength.  and now you'll see it first hand .  no .  all wrapped up in the past.  but why then do you walk the pokmon path in the first place .  tell me, why do you battle .  now, lairon .  stand by for battle .  lairon .   lairon, the iron armor pokmon.  it digs up iron ore for food, and smashes its steely body up against others in battles over territory.  registeel, return .  regice, i need your assistance .  iron defense .  does that...  right, it increases defensive power.  yeah, paul wants to hang in there and look for a chance to counterstrike.  ice beam, go .  what the...  zap cannon .  man, lairon didn't even get to attack once .   pika .  ursaring, standby for battle .  use hammer arm .  focus punch, go .   pika .  now focus blast .  zap cannon .  whoa, what happened .  zap cannon always paralyzes its target if it hits.  why isn't paul switching .  now, regice, return .  regirock, i need your assistance .  regirock again .  use stone edge .  ursaring, return .  paul had already given up on ursaring.  he didn't give a single command.  now, magmar, stand by for battle .  magmar .  paul's last pokmon.  not only is it a bad matchup, regirock is just too powerful.  it's almost over.  now, flamethrower .  mar .  shock wave, let's go now .  mar...  mag...  paul lost.  after all that .  young man, this battle of yours, was that your true battle .  you've done an excellent job raising and training your pokmon, but you allow your emotions to betray you on the battlefield.  we will battle again one day, when you've learned to control them.   rock, paper, scissors, shoot .  bet i make you look .   rock, paper, scissors, shoot .  bet i make you look .   twerps .  you can expect to see me at the snowpoint gym.  great, paul .  i'll be looking forward to it.  so, zoey, i guess it's our turn next, right .  huh .  akiaibattle with you and me .  let's get going.  you bet, ms. senior .  and much good luck with your next contest, dawn .  thank you .  piplup .   okay, everyone, see you around .   see you, dawn .   byebye, zoey .  good luck .   take care .  hey, paul .  do you think there's any chance that you and ash could treat us to a full battle at some point .   me and paul .  you two .  interesting idea .  let's set the time and place and agree to meet again .  that's bound to be a battle guaranteed to raise the level of both of you, of that there can be no doubt .  yeah.  great, i'm in .  i'm in, too.  reggie, what about the time and place .  exactly ten days from now, at the pokmon center near lake acuity .  and so, one wonders what paul has taken away from his battle with brandon and how that mightaffect the upcoming full battle between ash and paul.  you'll need to stay tunedfor the answer, and patiently waitten days in the process.  brandon .  something terrible hashappened at the temple .  oh, no .  captioned bysoundwriters . hot
