'kay, paul.  it's a deal.   paul wasn't able to tap in to chimchar's true power, that's gotta mean something.  i just know it.   it shows no one knows a pokemon's potential.  so trainers have to trust their intuition as best they can.  and the way ash learns how to deal with chimchar's power is going to have a huge effect on how his next battle with paul turns out.   hey, let's you and i work hard and we'll win the whole sinnoh league, okay.   narrator:major events can happen in unexpected ways, as this battle between ash and paul proves.  the question remains what will be the outcome of their next battle encounter.  you've got to stay tuned to find out.ards started raining down everywhere.  at first they seemed harmless enough so a bunch of us kids invented this cool new game...  that's when we realized those cards weren't so harmless after all.  they were packed with incredible powers from another world.  my name is dan, and together with my friends, runo...  marucho...  julie...  not to mention mr. hotshot himself, shun...  and alice, we are...  the bakugan battle brawlers.  bakugan.  one goal... two worlds.  . what are you going to do. .  . the odds are stacked against you .  . back against the wall .  . gotta give it your all... .  . ah ha ah ha .  . this is the final stand .  . ah ha ah ha .  . the power's in your hand .  . two worlds collide .  . on the inside .  . you gotta fight for what's right .  . before it's gone, gone, gone .  . this is bakugan. .  dan: bakugan battle brawlers in bakugan idol.   what.  wow, a penthouse with a high view...  too bad the commute's a real killer.  ho. taxi.  quick.  to the flower bed below and step on it.  yah, they certainly are taking their time.  but after six months of construction and two months of coffee breaks, we still don't know what it is.  what on earth could take so long to build.  a government office.  if you ask me...  how about a fitness centre and a spa.  dan: i think you're all building something out of nothing.  it's not nothing...  a mall or a coffee shop could have disastrous effects on my parents' restaurant.  and according to my market research calculation...  ha, market research.  don't make me laugh...  you barely have customers never mind a market.    oh. you.  grrrr.  dan. just let this one go.  this is one battle you won't win.  why you freeloading ungrateful brat.  but, but it was just a joke.  don't freeze me out of the free snackage...  i'm your best customer.  hey guys.  i just solved theskyscraper mystery.  hunh.   turns out.  it's my brand new house.   yah i know.  i was floored when my parents first told me where we were gonna be moving to.  i kept it a secret so that i could tell you in person and see the look on your faces.  and, so we're throwing a party and you're all invited.   oh no.  oh, nononono.   silence. silence.  evil five headed monster.  back off.  i have weapons.  what. what are you doing. )
