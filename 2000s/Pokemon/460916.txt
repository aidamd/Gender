ba .  come on, toothless.   croconaw, are you okay .  chika. croconaw.  monferno, you were awesome.  wow, cyndaquil, you were amazing as well.  cynda, cynda.   you know, lyra, using light screen to weaken their attack and then counterstrike...  i thought it was a good strategy.  but don't forget, we were up against ash with seven badges and dane with four ribbons.  the strategy may have been good, but it wasn't enough, that's all.  but i've gotta tell you totodile evolving into croconaw was the biggest surprise of all.  pikachu.  i'll tell you, ash and dawn's teamwork was something to see.  but the team of khoury and lyra worked together just as well.  honestly, i really wasn't sure who was gonna win.  well, cyndaquil hasn't had much battle experience, so this was perfect.  piplup .  lyra, there's no doubt that you're going to be a great trainer and khoury a great breeder one of these days.  just make sure you keep working together to support each other just like today.  together .   oh, hello, dad.  nice to see you, khoury.  i've just arrived here at the airport, so i wanted to give a call and find out where i should meet you when you two get here.  i totally forgot .  the johto flight is leaving any minute .  oh, no, we've gotta move .  huh . ah.  khoury .  made it.  and got in right under the wire, too.   hey, brock, thanks for everything.  there's still so much more i wanna learn, though.  just remember, the numberone job of a breeder is connecting with pokmon.  all you need is more time to meet with different types and trainers and coordinators, you know .  right, i'll do my best.  hey, i know.  when we get back to johto, khoury, let's go on a journey together.  you said so yourself that it's great to be around friends, right .  think of you and me together.  we'd really be able to help each other sharpen up our skills, you know .  this is such a surprise.  i can't believe you'd ask me to do that.  does that mean... no .  the reason totodile evolved was because of you, lyra.  i think the intense way you believe in your pokmon got transferred over to totodile somehow.  khoury .  i'm sure of it.  when i'm with you, it feels like great things are going to happen all of the time.  and so... i'd like to go with you.  well, it's my pleasure.  of course.  truth is there's nothing like good friends.  and, lyra, i just know you're gonna get your third johto badge, too.  pika, pika .  and to win it, you'll be battling whitney from the goldenrod gym or morty from the ecruteak gym.  they're both really strong.  no problem.  i'll just have to do my best, no matter who it is.  hey, ash, you're going for your eighth sinnoh gym badge, right .  yeah.  if i win at the sunyshore gym, then it'll finally be time to be in the sinnoh league.  pika, pika .  and lots of luck to you on your fifth ribbon, dane.  thanks.  i'll get number five for sure, and that's going to get me to the grand festival.  piplup .  it's obvious that my son owes you a lot for all the help you've given him.  i'm grateful.  so please accept this little gift.  cool, a pokgear .  whoa, you sure . of course.  oh, thank you so much .  brock, do you think i could call you if i ever need any help or advice .  sure, anytime you want is fine.  and so, as lyra and khoury wing their way back home to johto, we leave our heroes as theygear up for their journey to sunyshore cityand the gym battle that may provide ash with hiseighth sinnoh badge, so stay tuned .  captioned bysoundwriters arfield:      garfield:  ahh.  mmm. those were tasty cookies.  but i
