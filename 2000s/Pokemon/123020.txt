 gliscor...  gliscor is unable to battle .  the winner is torterra .  gliscor, return, now .  now you get a good rest.  thanks .  torterra was paul's first pokmon.  man, is torterra strong .  pika, pika .  that's great, pikachu, but electrictype moves won't work .  pika, pika.  okay, then everything's on your speed and your iron tail .  pikachu .  pikachu .  i'm counting on you, pikachu .  what theswitching again .  ursaring... standby for battle .  fickleminded twerps are by far the worst twerps of all .  wobbu .  man, they're not letting up for a second .  paul's pokmon know whatthey're supposed to do and they're doing itdown to the letter .  so that's gotta bepaul's battle style.  pika, pi .  this is mine .  pikachu, quick attack .  pika .  use hammer arm .  pikachu . lup .  pikachu .  yes, good one .  now use iron tail .  quick, focus blast .  what the...  is that what i think .  right, that's pikachu's static ability.  static can cause your opponent to become paralyzed when using a move that makes direct physical contact, so now it lks le pikachu's got the upper hand.  pika .  pika .  pikachu still has the burn effect from flame body .  lup .  finally .  look out .  pi... pika...  now hammer arm .  it's coming . thunderbolt, go .  pikachu .  where's that power coming from .  it hasn't even used bulk up .  pika .  pikachu .  pikachu . piplup .  ursaring's guts ability has been activated .  its attack stat is boosted when affected by things like paralysis, poison, and other status effects as well.  i'll bet you paul was just waiting for that ability to get activated all along.  pikachu.  pikachu, are you all right .  pika, pi.   pikachu is unable to battle .  the winner is ursaring .  no way .  even pikachu got pummeled.  ursaring's got brute to burn.  thanks, pikachu.  you battled really hard.  pika, pika.  you sit back and watch and i'll nail it this time.  pika.  i've got one pokmon left, while paul's still got five .  but paul's pokmon have all taken damage.  it's not over yet .  we can still do this .  up to you, chimchar.  pika, pika.  chimchar .  it's going to be really tough to beat all five of paul's pokmon with just chimchar.  when she'll cry when her boyfriend doesn't call.  she'll cry when you don't let her borrow the car.  but now is one time she won't shed a single tear.  as gentle to the eyes as pure water.  johnson's no more tears baby shampoo.  q/yy n.a.btw use flame wheel .  chimchar .  ursaring, use slash .  chimchar, flamethrower .  chimchar .  now use dig .  use hammer arm on the ground .  chimchar .  keep it up .  now use flamethrower .  chimchar .   ursaring is unable to battle .  the winner is chimchar .  chimchar, you were awesome .  chimchar, char .  wow, our chimmy's a champ .  that pokmon's second to none .  it's that kind of inspiration that gives hard work a good name.  wobbu .   thanks, chimchar, you rocked.  so let's keep this going.  let's turn it around .   pika.  chimchar's evolving .  monferno .  that's great .  you evolved into monferno .  monferno .  lup .   monferno, the playful pokmon, and the evolved form of chimchar.  it controls its flaming tail to keep its opponent at an ideal distance when battling.  amazing .  chimchar's answered ash's call and gained new power in order to rise to the challenge.  the trust between ash and his pokmon is being demonstrated right before our eyes.  monferno .  wow, monferno, you learned mach punch and that's a brandnew move .  mon, monferno .  electabuzz, stand by for battle .  chimchar wasn't really compatible with paul's training style, but with ash's training style, it's a perfect fit.  simple as that.  just as some pokmon have compatibility issues, there can be the same issues between pokmon and trainer and chimchar's evolution is a great example.  it's not a matter of right or wrong.  this battle has both ash and paul's pride on the line.  that's why this battle will make both trainers and pokmon much stronger in the long run.  hey, that's why you wanted a full battle.  mmhmm.  all right, monferno, use mach punch .  mon... ferno .  all right . pika .  wow .  monferno's super fast, piplup .  lup .  thunder .  ferno .  monferno, hang in there .  use flame wheel now .  monferno .  now flamethrower from up there .  monferno .  thunderpunch, quick .  monferno, dig .  monferno .  now flame wheel .  monferno .  thunder .  use flamethrower .  monferno .  keep it up, monferno .  pika .  all paul can dnow is defend.  you're right.  ash got his momentum back because of monferno's unbelievable speed .  mach punch, go .  protect .  thunder .  monferno, no .  quickly switching gears betweeack shows how impressive paul's electabuzz is .  monferno...  monferno, are you all right .  hold on.  monferno, use flamethrower now .  i knew it, it's paralyzed .  it can be an added effect of thunder .  uld it happen now .  huh .  monferno .  oh, no, is that blaze .  that's not blaze.  it's monferno's determination not to be beaten manifesting in its flame.  that's rignferno, we're not gonna give up, no matter what .  all right, monferno, mach punch .  electabuzz, thunderpunch .  mon...  pika.  monferno .  monferno is unable to battle and the winner is electabuzz .  which means that the victor is paul .  oh, no.  mon...  monferno, thank you.  monferno.   that was a spectacular battle many thanks .  yeah, it sure was.  it's been a while since i've seen that look on your face.  i'll send you my pokmon.  got it, paul.  oh, ash.  and so, with their pride on the line, ash and paul's full

" look at himhe's a boy.  what's so bad about this kid.  let'check out the complaint.  yusei fudo, turbo dueling without a license, blah blah, malicious mischief blawdy blah blahentering the limits of new domino city without a permit.  hmm.  well now, we can't have that, can we.  sos a little tracking dye.  is it supposed to tickle.  it's supposed to make sure we can keep an eye on you.  now to discuss punishment.  awwwww.  judge, voiceover: i believe a few months in the "the facility" should do it.  all aboard.  not to worry, young man.  think of it as a sort of summer camp.  lots of time to yourself, arts & crafts, colorful characters.  hi.  after your sentenceahemi mean, "vacation" is over, you're free to go back to satellite, as long as you never duel or set foot in new domino city again.  hey, kid.  huh. hmm.  how ya doin'.  i'm sure ya heard of me, young fella.  name's yanagi.  adventure's my name, and famous relics are my game.  put 'er there.  guess you're not into shaking hands.  well, that's alright.  waaait a second, i never forget a face.  you were at the kaiba dome.  i saw sector security take you away.  so was it you who made all the power in the city go out.  and that monster.  did you cause that red dragon to appear, .  'cause if ya did, not bad.  i mean that was was the most amazing thing i've ever seen.  you saw that.  did i see it.  the whole city saw that dragon.  please tell me where you got it.  east india.  the south american pyramids.  lost caves.  huh.  aah.  aah.  ah. my arm why does it hurt so much.  i can't remember.  mina. what happened to me last night.  what do you mean, mr. atlas.  are you saying that you don't remember.  you were in the kaiba dome.  you had a duel with a satellite named "yusei".  you had him on the ropes, and then he countered, and you countered, and then the power outage saved you from losing.  .  i had him right where i wanted him.  oh, um, of course you did.  please don't be angry mr. atlas.  right.  wait. where are you heading off to.  mr. goodwin told me you should be resting.  zigzix: you see, when jack and yusei's dragons attacked each other, there was a huge burst of the "ultimate energy" i was talking about.  i call it enerd.  it rhymes with "energy," and the "d" is for dueling, so you get, the, um, the idea. heh.  whatever we call it zigzix, this power flux was apparently strong enough to awaken d mystical powers of the crimson dragon.  .  but its energy is immeasurable.  we have no idea what would happen should all of its powers be unleashed.  earthquakes. tornadoes. cataclysmic catastrophes.  complete generator meltdown.  we lost the signal right here.  the dragon overloaded the power grid.  excellent.  so it seems the power created by its summoning is greater than we ever imagined.  heh heh heh.  hmm.  man: welcome to the facility, " a warm bed, three square meals a day, everytng the public miscreant could want.  hurry up.  computer: identification number g2ma288.  illegal entry to new domino city.  bet you wish you stayed in the satellite now.  now listen upthe rules are si: no chewing gum, no fighting, and no dueling.  also, you probably don't want to get too close to these bars.  some of these guys bite.  now as long as you stay quiet and follow those directions, you should be safe.  alright. here are your new rooms.  i hope the water stained battleship grey is to your liking.  ..  yanagi's been here a few times before as you can tell.  personally i think the food's finally gotten to him.  hey. guard.  what d'ya want.  thought i'd throw a little "welcome party" for my new neighbors.  you know, teach 'em the ropes, make sure they stay in line.  good luck.  new guy looks like trouble.  heh heh heh.  ahhhh. )
