weeping willow.     jon:   uh, uh, sycamore.   jon:   we have to take a break, but we'll return with more of your favorite game show, "say a kind of tree and we hit you with a "   garfield: jon always did have a taste for the really serious intellectual programs.   jon:   we'll be back with more of "say a kind of tree and we hit " after these news headlines.  today is the first day of the city's new dog licensing law.  any dog not wearing a license will be presumed a stray and taken to the dog pound.   jon:  oh, i almost forgot about that.  i got odie a license, and i have to put it on him.   in other news, traffic is stalled on the coast highway due to an accident.  workers said cars were blocked when a collision knocked down a large elm tree.   odie:   jon: i know you don't like it, but it's for your own good.  if they catch you without it, they'll haul you off to the pound.   garfield: oh, that would be justawful.  no, even i'm notthatrotten.   jon: there.  now, i'm going back to my favorite show, "say a kind of tree and we'll hit you with a "  garfield: just any sense of good taste.   odie:    jon: hope i'm not missing much.   garfield:    that feels good.   odie:    garfield: no, i don't want to throw the stick.   odie: aw.   garfield:   odie:   garfield: no, i don't want to throw the ball.  in fact, i want to throw the ball evenlessthan i wanted to  odie: aw.          garfield: no, i don't want to throw the doggy toy.  as hard as it may be to believe, i want to throw the doggy toy evenlessthan i wanted to throw the stick or the ball.  but you know what idowant to throw.   odie:     garfield: you had to ask.   odie:    garfield:   odie's license came off.  he's out there where they grab dogs that don't have licenses and take them to the pound.  not my problem.   odie:    there's another one.  no license.   odie:    you won't get away from me, dog.    odie:   whoa.  hey. watch it.  hey.  ]    odie:     sorry, pooch, but it's the law.   odie:    garfield:  i'm not asleep.  why can't i sleep.   it can't be because i feel guilty about odie out there without his dog license.  it's not my fault it fell off when i threw him out the window.  so why can't i sleep.  well, if i can't sleep, i might as well eat.   jon:  this is hilarious.   ..   douglas fir.   jon:  oh, this is good.   maple.   jon: can't get my breath.   mushroom omelet.   oh, i'm sorry, mr. fazblatt.  i checked with the judges, and they say "mushroom omelet" is notthe name of a tree, so we cannot hit you with a lemon meringue pie.   but now it's time for our home game, where one lucky viewer will get to play "say a kind of tree and we hit you with a lemon "  jon: "home game".  you mean someone will be hit with a lemon meringue pie just for saying, oh, i don't know, "spruce".   i'll get it.  uh, yes.   garfield: oh, great.  you finally won something, and it'sthat.   jon: i'll get dinner on the table.   mmm.  you call odie.   garfield: oh, odie.  well, no odie. let's eat.    jon: where's odie.  i'm not serving dinner until odie is at the table.   garfield: but that's not fair.  i'm  jon: i'm serious, garfield.  no dinner until odie is at the table.  and now go out and find him.   garfield:..   jon:   garfield: i'm going to find him.  odie.  odie. yoohoo.  odie. odie.  odie.  attention, brainless mutt.   if you're looking for your dog, i saw him get taken off to the pound.    garfield: i was afraid of that.   well, this is it.  i'm actually walking into a building full of dogs voluntarily.    sorry, cat.  you see that sign.  that means no cats allowed.     look, mommy.  someone threw away a perfectly good pussycat.   hmph.  they probably thought he was too )
