 you need to learn how powerful each other has and thatlead to your own evolution as a trainer.  waitme, e.  you too, paul.  so where do we battle .  right here.  right here, really .  well, we can't use the field at the pokmon center, so i thought it might be nice to give it your all in the great outdoors.  surehow's it sound, paul .  it doesn't matter to me.  that settles it .  good, we're all decided .  ready to referee .  i sure amand  that's us .   helping .  wow, awesomewhat's that .  piplup .  it's a portable reference monitor.  okay, team, all set .   right, couldn't be any more setter .   representing kanto is ash from pallet town .  representing sinnoh is paul from veilstone city .  we now begin a sixonsix full battle .  there is no time limit, and both sides may exchange pokmon freely as desired .  the battle will be over when all six pokmon on either side are unable to continue .  we will now use coin toss to see who will mount the first attack .  all right then, trainers, heads or tails, what will it be .  i call heads. then tails.  heads, so ash has the honor .  okay, pikachu, let's do this .  pika .  all right, buizel, i choose you .  torterra, stand by for battle .  bui, bui . torterra .  torterra, huh .   a button here, a button there .  all right, let the battle begin .  buizel, turn now .  joining team xtreme.  tell 'em, dwade.  ...  and playing.  thousands have already joined.  ..  to minnesota.  ..  to l.a.  you can join team xtreme and enter for a chance to win a tripto nba allstar 2011.  no purchase necessary.  many will enter,few will win.  ask your parents permission.  i wonder what they play in china.  let's check it out.  you can find out moreat goldfishfun.com.  r . bigfoot .  . monstrous as can be . uhoh .  . he's bigfoot the monster,he listens to me . x walk bigfoot.  . i've got a monsterhe'll rock and he'll roll .  . bigfoot .  bigfoot the monstercomes with remote control and rechargeable batteries,other batteries not included.  buizel, return now .  having second thoughts is usually not the twerp way.  how does he change his mind when he has none .  i was looking forward to watching buizel kick someone else's booty for a change .  wobba .  buizel, i really wanted to battle with you, but the thing is, watertype moves don't really work well against torterra.  so hang tight 'til the next time.  you're up insteadgliscor, i choose you .  gliscor .  paul, remember gliscor .  you met it back when it was still a gligar.  wow, the older twerp seems to be tonguetied.  better gagged than grouchy.  wobba .  gliscor, nowsand attack .  gliscor, gliscor, gliscor .  terra .  using sand attack was a wise move.  ash has battled against torterra several times in the past, and watched it in battle as well.  he really knows torterra's so he's blocking its vision.  giga drain .  torterra .  gliscor .  it workedtorterra missed .  i have a sneaking suspicion paul used that attack knowing it was going to miss.  i think you're right .  purposefully while still in that sand attack.  but why .  to try and get ash to let down his guard a bit.  when an opponent's attack misses, a trainer can get a bit too comfortable mentally.  now, gliscor, use xscissor .  gliscor .  torterra .  gliscor .  pika .  check that outtorterra took it .  frenzy plant .  terra .  awesome .  pip, piplup .  frenzy plant is the most potent grasstype move with all that sheer power on tap.  yeah, but it's a risky move, too.  now, fly, gliscor .  gliscor .  torterra's in trouble .  that's the risk of frenzy plant.  after the attack, torterra won't be able to move for awhile.  now's our chanceuse fire fang .  gliscor...  gliscor .  torterra felt that .  gliscor .  use xscissor .  gliscor... gliscor .  yeah, that worked, too .  gliscor, let's use one more attack .  steel wind, let's go .  gli...  torterra, crunch . tor .  scor .  terra . gli .  gliscor, no .  gliscor got caught .  pip, piplup .  gliscor, gliscor, gli, gliscor .  now, giga drain .  oh, no . pika, pika .  gli .  gliscor, your power's being drained .  you've got to get away quick .  piplup, piplup .  gliscor .  come on, gliscor, stay strong . pika, pika .  so this is what paul was after .  if torterra became immobilized from the frenzy plant, he knew ash would unleash a barrage of closerange attacks .  right, paul is well aware that ash knows torterra's battling style, formulated his strategy around that .  oh, man...  hang in there, gliscor .  use fire fang .  gliscor . terra .  way to go .  gli...  that's the damage from torterra's crunch .  okay, gliscor, return .   i know this battle's just getting started, but i can hardly breathe just from watching .  piplup .  take a good rest .  i promise nothing you did will go to waste.  'torterra's taken that much damage, but paul still won'tswitch pokmon .  nowit's time to finish this thing up .  staraptor, i choose you .  staraptor .  staraptor must've evolved from the staravia i battled once, right .  right, staraptor even beat paul's honchkrow in a pokringer match .  wow, paul's honchkrow, that's pretty amazing .  all right, brave bird .  use stone edge .  stone edge, why .  staraptor, no .  wow, that wasmore than effective.  that's the reason paul didn't switch pokmon.  there's no doubt in my mind paul was expecting ash to bring out staraptor next.  that's why he used stone edge to stop staraptor's brave bird and all of ash's continued assaults as well.  do either of you know if ash came up with a battling strategy for today .  like mixing up the order of the pokmon he'd be using against paul .  no, i think ash was planning on using you see, except for pikachu, ash got all of his pokmon after coming here to sinnoh.  i knew it .  paul pickedhis pokmon lineup based on all the previous battles he's had against ash.  that's why he can predict with such accuracy what pokmon is coming next.  weavile, stand weavile .   status update coming right up .    staraptor, can you still battle .  star, star .  all right, then quick attack .  use swords d wea... vile .  wea, wea .  what's that .  it's called swords dance, and it increases its user's attack power .  now, aerial ace .  staraptor .  blizzard .  weavile .  now use metal claw .  wea . star .  pika .  weavile's faster than staraptor .  weavile .  go after it, weavile, quick .  it's comingclose combat .  star .  metal claw, now .  wea... vile .  star .  star .  staraptorit has the advantage.  that's a really effective move.  star .  wea .  blizzard .  brave bird, let's go .  weavile .  weavile is unable to battle, so the winner is staraptor .  staraptor .  staraptor, you were awesome .  pika . staraptor .  all right, that's one pokmon down .  pip, piplup .  this is no timeto celebrate.  that weavile was movingeven faster than staraptor .  finally, a pokmon hits the dirt.  but if you think the little twerp's romping happily in the park, think again .  i'm ready for a battle nap.  all right, staraptor, return .  you deserve a good rest.  electabuzz, stand by for battle .  grotle, i choose you .  an electrictype, what's he up to .  all right, grotle, energy ball .  grotle .  light screen, let's go .  electabuzz took grotle's energy ball .  light screen is a move that cuts the effect of special attacks down by half.  energy ball is a special attack, so electabuzz barely felt it.  paul's switching pokmon already .  pika .  honchkrow, stand by for battle .  honchkrow .  uhoh, honchkrow .  those two pokmon battled against each other before.  and right in the middle of the whole thing, turtwig evolved into grotle .  now i see.  then grotle's angry reaction goes back to that battle.  grotle .  all right, grotle, you're on .  it's time to show those two what you've got .  but honchkrow's got the advantage because of type .  piplup .  grotle, razor leaf .  grotle .  krow, krow, krow .  night slash .  krow .  honchkrow .  all right, grotle, energy ball .  grotle .  what thelight screen .  so i guess the effects of light screen must carry through to the next pokmonis that right .  not only does honchkrow have a type advantage, but by leaving light screen in play, it decreases all the damage from grotle's attacks.  paul's goal is obviously to overwhelm ash.  he wants to overwhelm ash .  now use haze .  you know, now that you mention it, paul's battle style seems different than usual.  normally the battles we've seen paul in are ones where he's busy polishing his pokmon's moves, or when his complete objective is testing their strength.  razor leaf, let's go .   but it's not like that at all today.  a pokmon battle will test both a trainer's intellectual ability as well as judgment.  yeah, paul has dissected ash's battle style that keeps ash from battling soundly.  and that means paul's going at it with nothing less for his goal than a 100% sure win.  grotle's taking a lot of damage.  use synthesis .  now, sky attack, quick .  oh, no .  ished recovering yet .  now, grotle, use rock climb .  grotle .  honchkrow .  stand byor battle .  magmortar. pika .  magmortar .  he really leveled up his magmar.  both trainers may be one pokmon down, but paul continuesto overwhelm ash with his carefullystrategy.  now, what kind of fiercebattling will we see from this point onward .  you'll have to stay tunedto find out the
