mime, mime, mime .  team rocket .  yeah, they're a bunch of crooks that try to steal other people's pokmon .   we succeed, too .  i didn't know we had brakes.  balloons don't have brakes.  maybe there's a recall.  snorlax is packing too many pounds .  this wouldn't have been necessary if you'd packed it in its pokball .  hindsight is overrated as a useful tool.  we'll, i'm no fool.  yanmega, help us cut and run .  with pikachu in our possession snorlax is nothing but ballast, so cut loose that loser with steel wing .  excellent .  return.   and so, off we go into a sky of blue sporting

daniel, thanks a lot for getting pikachu away from team rocket.  pika, pika .  well, if i'm gonna beat you fair and square, i've gotta use science all the way down the line .  participants will please report to the track immediately, as our third event, the hurdledash, is about to begin.  uhoh.  we'd better get moving, quick . right .  hi, i'm amy.  i have a husbandand two boys.  that is three guysand a lot of laundry.  i was given thebouncedryer bar, asked to use it,and answer a few questions.  i noticed it was theoriginalbouncesmell, which was so great, because it'sclean and fresh and it's justreally light.  and i just love it.  to install thebouncedryer bar was so easy.  just stick itand forget it.  you don't have to rememberthe dryer sheet now.  it's one more thingi don't have to think about.  i love it.  thebouncedryer bar.  gives you automaticfreshness and satisfactionguaranteed, or we'll give youyour money back.  ion competitors.  the hurdle dash will begin inexactly one minute.  wow, i'm wondering where ash and daniel could be.  yeah, and after they both did so well by ending up tying for the first round.   hey, wait for us .  that sounded like ash.  piplup . look, over there .  sorry .  see, we got hung up.  but we're all ready to go now.   then hurry. right .  what's that .   it syncs you up with your pokmon.  it uses the same principles as the device i use in my training.  now that each trainer has received their devices, i will now explain how they're used.  you will notice that each of your pokmon has been equipped with a video camera.  the image from that camera will be visible to the trainer using the goggles they've just been given.  as each pokmon runs, hurdles will suddenly appear on the track.  however, these hurdles will b b b b b b b b be before their pokmon.  at the appropriate time, the trainers will jump, which then transmits a signal to their pokmon, signaling them to jump.  success in the thirdround hurdle dash will depend on the perfect timing and execution of those jumps.  here we go.  yeah, i think we both know who's gonna win this.  'kay, let's do this fair and square.  you've got it .  now, everybody ready to go .  all right, countdown.  three, two, one.  pika .  snor .  abra .  machoke .  abra, abra, abra .   there's one.  pi, pi, pi, pi, pi, pi, pi...  now .  snorlax.  lax .  abra, abra, abra, abra .  abra, abra, abra .  pikachu and snorlax are neck and neck .  run, pikachu .  go, ash, do it . piplup .  pika .  snorlax, snorlax, snorlax .  c'mon, pikachu .  pika .  snorlax, almost .  lax .  snorlax, snorlax, snorlax...  whoa .  all right, who won .   upon careful review, our judges have determined that snorlax's belly edged in first, and that makes the winners of the camellia pokathlon daniel and snorlax .   congratulations, daniel.  hey, ash.  that was awesome.  from now, on i'm gonna have to pay lots more attention to your training style.  well, actually...  to be totally honest, i realize i shouldn't rely that much on science.  i've gotta learn how to understand my pokmon's feelings as well.  yeah, and you'll be great at it, too .  pika, pika .  good luck in the johto pokathlon.  i'm rooting for ya.  thanks, and i'll be rooting for you in the sinnoh league.  you know, i think those two are buddies now.  yeah, their training styles may be different, but their love of pokmon goes beyond those differences.  your contest is coming soon.  and i can hardly wait .  what do you say, piplup .  piplup .  although unsuccessful at winning the pokathlon, ash was a huge success atmaking a new friend.  and now it'son to daybreak town, where dawn's fifth contestribbon hangs in the balance.  you

jr.   let's play.  round one.  many great scholars have been puzzled by this famous conundrum.  one plus one equals what.  take your time, contestants.  this is a tricky question.     el destructo rings in first.  what is your answer, el.     oh, no, that is just so wrong.  it's slime time.  i love this game.  round two: sumo madness.  to advance to the next round, you must remove your opponent from that platform.   after years of training, el destructo's body has become a finelytuned machine.  just look at those hands.  designed to distract and confuse his opponent, he carefully moves in to deliver the finaloh, wait.  we've never seen this one before.  that is quite a fall.   ouch, what an upset.  round three: pugil stick battlerama.  our contestant must stay on his tower to advance to the next round.   el destructo wastes no time.  look at that combattested precision.  what technique.  what style.  our contestant should be giving up right about now.  oh, that came out of nowhere.  round four.  treadmill mayhem.  all you have to do is make it to the finish line on a tricycle to complete the task.  oh, and watch out for el destructo and el destructo, jr.      there he goes, and there goes el destructo.  that ez chair's not gonna make his life any easier.  and he better not start feeling too safe.  el destructo wants to tire this guy out.  and he's not just clowning around.  he's almoosed done him in.  this is not the time to be too picky, folks.   someone please stop me.  no, seriously, stop me.    well, well, our contestant sure made short work out of this obstacle course.  but wait, el destructo has one more trick up s sleeve: an elephant toss.  or should i say an elephant drop.  ouch.  round five.  congratulations.  you're the first to ever make it this far.  but are you ready for the final challenge.  the gauntlet.     ha ha ha ha.     ready.  good.  go, go, go.  let's see how he fares against the collosal robobasher.  in the driver's seat, i wouldn't want to be in the challenger's shoes.  for those with weak stomachs, now would be a good time to turn away.  this is about to get ugly.    it looks like it's all over for our courageous challenger.  but wait, it's the old crayon dummy trick.  very clever.  the challenger has made it this far on luck, but it will take more than luck for him to get past the pool of pain.  it will take gumballs.  gumballs.   here's junior.  he's gonna wish that he stayed with those masticating crocs now that el destructo has him in the crosshairs of his basketball cannon.   destructo is showing no mercy tonight.  ..  and driving for the basket.   and here's junior for the assist.      that's it. i can't look.     it's all over now for our challenger.     all those dreams of pickleade now dashed in the arena of anguish.   oh, the humanity.   what.  junior seems to have lost power to the suit.  i thought i told him to plug that thing in last night.   what's this.    uhoh, the target's been hit.  no one has ever hit the target before.  you'  i can't believe he won.  that's not supposed to happen.  we should get that fixed.  who would have thought someone would really win.      no pickles were harmed during the making of this show.  when she'll cry when her boyfriend doesn't call.  she'll cry when you don't let her borrow the car.  but now is one time she won't shed a single tear.  as
