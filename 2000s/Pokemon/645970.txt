maid cafe.   maid cafe.   never heard of it.   pika.   it's like a second home to me.   i'm back    hello. welcome home.  uh h.   what do they mean, "welcome home".  it's just their way of making you feel relaxed and comfortable like you're in your own home.   here you go.   thank you. hi there.  my name's brock.  what might your name be.   i'm spring.   summer.   autumn.   if you radiant beauties have ..   croagunk.  ..  ..p.r.ou  croagunk.   dear. i hope he's all right.   with you three, he'll be just fine.   so what will it be.   well, what's looking good today.   our specialty is our farmfresh miltank milk.   huh.   so true.   what did i tell you.   miltank milk is bursting with vitamins.  nothing could be healthier to drink.   a round for me and my pokemon.   pika pika.   me and my pokemon, too.   in that case, i think it's time for a trip to the barn.    all right.  we've got some thirsty customers.   time to come in.     awesome, look at 'em go.   computer voice:miltank, the milk cow pokemon.  it is widely known that drinking miltank milk when you're young helps you grow up to be strong and healthy.   those two miltank are mine and that miltank right there is summer's.   autumn, what about you.   i actually do have a miltank, ..    wow, they're going in all by themselves.   and that's a sign of excellent training.    here. your fresh milk.   all: ahh.    yum.   everyone's gonna love it.  all right, time for a milk break.     you, too.     let's go, gang.       that's so cute.  is it good.   hap happiny.   autumn, where's your miltank, anyway.  ..   i see her.  sittin' out in the meadow.    and i just got her.  but for some strange reason she won't listen to a thing i say.   she's probably not used to you yet.   it's natural if she just got here.   that's not it.  the truth is ilta is one selfish miltank.  argh.  and she's not even that cute so i'm starting to think i'll just let her go.   that's wrong.   huh.   you can't do that.  giving up on your miltank without first taking enough time to get to know and understand her is no good for either of you.   right.   wow, brock, you certainly are a wise man.  i'm working to be a top pokemon breeder.  so i really think i could help autumn work out any problems with her miltank.   you mean it, brock.   yes, i'm all yours.   uh, i think you're supposed to be helping me.   croagunk.   first, i could use ..   pikachu.   we have a ton of customers.  so let's go.   great, i'm coming.  why don't you stay and listen to more of brock's wisdom, autumn.   good idea.   whoa, i guess this place can get really busy.   what do you say you and i give them a hand.   sounds good.   pikachu.   yeah.   ambi.   pikachu.   isn't this a bit over the top.   i'm sorry, but that's all we've got.   don't worry about it.  you lookreat.   we're back.   i'll show 'em some real service.  welcome home  pikachu.     a maid cafe can be a gold mine.   if you make the customer feel like they're number one, they'll pgh touhr the nose.   my prizewinning role awaits.   role.   with my acting prowess they'll be customer putty in my hands.  my redhot performance will burn holes in their bulging billfolds.   it's a maid cafe, not a fire sale.   nice to know a happy customer and his money are soon parted.   wobuffet.   i've even got the coffee.   that was going to save me from a caffeine headache.   the customer comes first at our maid cafe.   hooray.   wobuffet.  ..   when raising a pokemon, there's one thing you must do above all else and that thing is to earn its trust.   i have a question, please.  exactly how does one earn a pokemon's trust.   good question.  the first thing you do is ou b ond with her.   watch.  hey, happiny, see that flower there.  pretty, isn't it.   happiny.  hap hap happiny.   just like that.   i understand now, brock.  i'll give it a try.   excuse me, ilta.  see the flower.  ilta. flower.     oh, itla, please.   just relax.  ..    right.  look, ilta.  isn't this flower nice.   mil.   no, you're supposed to admire it, not eat it.   was it good.  i bet it tasted great.   mil mil.   okay, i'll bet it tasted great, too.   mil.    that was completely disgusting and gross.  ..  kindness and patience.   i understand.   let's work on praise giving.  it's good for building morale and we could all use a bit more of that, right.   okay.   all right, happiny let's cross the bridge.   happiny.  happiny.   now don't be afraid.  i know you can do it.   happ.  hap hap.  hap hap hap.  happiny.   happiny, that was great.   happiny.   i'll tell you, you're a real champ.    that's so sweet.  wish we could be that close.   okay, you two, it's your turn.   right.  let's go, ilta.  come on, ilta, time's a wasting.    hurry, ilta.  i've got some pecha berries for you.   mil.  mil mil, mil mil.  mil mil, mil mil, mimil.   hey, what's wrong.   remember, autumn, you've got to cheer her on.   oh, yeah, that's right.  now, show some spine.   mil mil.   don't worry, i'm here.  aah.  help me, please.   i'm coming.  hold tight.   no, i'm slipping.  aaah.  oh, brock.   now, just hang on tight and i'll pull you up.   okay.   aah.   aaaaah.   happiny.   aaah.    i'm sorry, i'm so clumsy you could've really been ht.  i don't deserve a wonderful teacher like you.   i don't care if you're a little bit clumsy.   huh.   all i care about is you don't give up.   oh, brock.   now, time for the next lesson.   right.    we made it through the rush hour so i can handle things myself from here on in.   great.  now, let's practice that energy ball and get

fun working hard.  so i'll work hard, too.  huh.   in the middle of all that flash, ambipom's disappeared.  you've gotta remember your pokemon are the main attraction.  you've spent so much time polishing your moves, you've forgotten what you really need to do to show them off.   but now i'm not sure what to practice.   piplup.  i'm sorry i had you so worried.  i do know a trainer shouldn't act the way i've been acting.  huh.  oops.  hi, ash.   pika pika.   how come you're crying, dawn.   it's nothing.   did you get something in your eye.   yeah, that's it.   i'm kinda hungry, so why don't we go and get something to eat.   how does some ice cream sound. good.   now you're talking.  come on.   let's talk about shampoo and grooming.  it is to make sure your pokemon looks good.  but it's also a perfect time to make sure your pokemon's healthy.  ready to give it a try.   all set.   back and forth, but gently.   right. i see.  ilta, stay.  just like that.  i'll be nice and gentle.  nice and gentle, back and forth.  nice and gen.   relax.   right.   mil.   i'm so sorry.  hold on, i'll get you a towel.  aaaah.   are you okay.   no, brock, i'm not okay.  i'm so clumsy and useless.  all i ever do is cause trouble.   hmm.  remember, a trainer can't lose it like that and expect their pokemon to obey.   huh.   rule number one, the most important thing ..   you have to earn a pokemon's trust.   bingo.  so come on, dry your eyes.   sorry.  i won't cry again.   now that's the spirit.   this isn't coffee.   it's nothing but a cup of hot water.   stop.  if you've got a complaint, i suggest you be up front about it.    wow, this isn't as much like home as i thought.   there's no place like home, but this isn't it.   they didn't even have any miltank milk, so who
