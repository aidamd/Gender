legendary ruin here inside mount coronet, and i'm here to find out what they want with it.  i'm gonna get you all out of here, so stay cool until the opportunity arises.  excellent.  you're not going anywhere.  who are you .  sir .  i've been sent by headquarters to assist the expedition, sir.  hmm, they shouldn't have done that.  we already have more than enough manpower.  i arrived in a hurry, sir, so i only know this concerns ruins.  please, sir, bring me up to speed, if you would.  dear me, what a bother.  our mission is to find the gateway to spear pillar, which is located here on mount coronet.  the tricky part, of course, is to find out exactly where.  what's spear pillar .  gateway .  of course, when we do finally find the gateway...  show him.  sir .  we will then employ this key with which to open it.    whoa, that's a key .  so team galactic is looking for the ruin.  that's why they dug all those tunnels.  that's why the pink western shellos wound up here.  it got lost and wound up on the east side.  shellos.   take note of this, charon.  remember our boss has entrusted that key to us, so be extra careful.  save your breath.  i couldn't care less about dialga and palkia.  and i could care less than that about your socalled new world.  if you should succeed in ruling this world, it can only benefit me anyway.  so of course, i hope team galactic can deliver the goods.   what a crazy key.  yes, some shape.  a normalshaped key it's not.  who cares what shape it's in .  abnormal or not, we'll grab it and open the gateway to that whatchamacallit, right .  i'm there.  no need to twist my arm for treasure.  wobbuffet .  so, now that you're up to speed, get to work.  after all, that's why you were sent here, right .  sir .  what theend of the line, team galactic.  mr. looker .  all right, who are you .  i am a member of the international police.  the name's looker.  international police .  wow, who knew .  dig that.  that's that guy who gave us those boxed lunches.  all we need is the international police.  it appears we've wandered into a brouhaha.  i recently received a report about some meddling outside agent spying on our work.  and that would be you .  we're always keeping a close eye on everything you do.  shellos, shellos...  shellos . piplup .  hey, protect shellos, quick.   got it .  put away the key.  sir .  now capture that man.    shellos, wait up .  sweet pandemonium, now's our chance.  launch.  drat .  hurry and catch him.   hello.  all right, seviper, use haze.  viper.  what's going on .  the key is gone.   way gone .  the gateway to the whatchamacallit is but putty in our hands.  i've had enough, who are you .  when it comes to this team, too much is never enough.  since we're so strong and tough.  on the wind.  past the stars.  ready and rough.   silence .  give us that key at once .  did your mother interrupt you .  someone needs to teach you manners, jack.  though, since the key's in our care, there's no need to share.  all right, surround them.   shell, shell, shell, shell, shell, shell...  it's all right, shellos.  we promised we'd take you back to your friends and we will.  pika, pika.  pip, piplup.  you'll be home again soon.  pip, piplup.   look at him go.  man, mr. looker's awesome.  pika.  wow, that guy's strong.   charon, sir, we have a signal.  let me see.  hmm, it appears there's a space behind this stone, signaling a ruin of some sort.  finally.  toxicroak, appear now.  toxicroak.  toxicroak, use rock smash and destroy the wall.  toxicroak.  croak, croak, croak.  so there's a ruin on the other side.  croak, croak, croak...  whoa, look at that.  is that the gateway... to spear pillar .  you had better be correct this time.  'course i am.  that is indeed the gateway to spear pillar.  good.  i'll be taking that key back from you now.   dream on, dweeb.  do it.  that's our treasure.  stealing what's been stolen is bad luck.  what he said.  now, toxicroak, use dark pulse.  toxicroak .  why couldn't we have opened the whatchamacallit with that key .  it's not a whatchamacallit.  you see, it opens the gateway to spear pillar and you don't.  wobbu, wobbu.   we're blasting off again.   wobbuffet.   all right, take the key out of its case.  sir .  ah, the key.  open the gateway and then direct us to spear pillar straight away.  so, charon, why isn't the key responding .  well, it looks like we got the wrong ruin.  we what .  obviously this ruin isn't the gateway to spear pillar, understand .  all right, pull out.  team galactic, stop .  mr. looker .  i'll be fine.  but youstop them from getting away.  right, got it.  quick, pikachu, use thunderbolt.  and piplup, use bubblebeam.  pikachu .  piplup, lup, lup.  they got away.  what's going on .  shellos. piplup.  pikachu.  now what .  the subsurface water is rising.  it's all flooding out because toxicroak destroyed the rock.  quick, get in everybody.  right.     all right, so we failed to locate it today, but the gateway to spear pillar is definitely located somewhere on mount coronet.  so now we need to figure out which area to search next.

all in one piece.   by the way, we had no idea you were an international police officer.  uh...  i didn't mean to surprise you.  i'm going to head back to headquarters now.  so what are you going to do .  see, we all promised shellos that we were gonna take it back to its friends.  pip, piplup.  pikachu.  well, it looks like we're already on the western side of the mountain, so i'm sure you'll easily find shellos' home.  stay out of trouble.   right.  look over there.   amazing .   all the tunnel entrances on the mountainside have been sealed.  the sediment must've loosened up from the subsurface water and plugged all the holes.  wow, that's great.  so now the shellos won't get lost and end up on the wrong side of the mountain ever again.  thank goodness .  shellos, shellos, shellos...  look at that, it's shellos' herd.  shell, shell, shell.  shellos.  shellos, shellos...  now, you're back with your friends.  take good care.  and don't get lost again, okay .  pip, piplup.
