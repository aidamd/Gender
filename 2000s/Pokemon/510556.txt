 pika, pika .  pika, pika .  guess nothing's ever easy, right .  hold on.  hey, lyra, where's marill .  huh .  you mean marill's not around .  i don't see it anywhere.  i hope marill hasn't wandered off again.  marill . pika, pika .  marill, where are you .  marill .  piplup .  cynda .  cynda, cynda, cynda, cynda... pip, pip, pip, pip, pip...  cynda, cynda, cynda, cynda... pip, pip, pip, pip, pip...  quil . piplup .  cynda. lup.  piplup.  what's that .  it's the valley windworks.  oh, the valley windworks .  marill might've gone in there.  then let's check it out.   marill .   marill .  huh .  there .  marill .  piplup. quil.  pip, piplup.  pip, piplup .  piplup, no.  magnemite. magnemite.  magnemite .  hey, maybe they're here to guard the windworks.  magnemite .    that was close.   huh .   now where are we .   huh .  now, what are you kids doing in here .  uh, sorry we came in without permission.  see, my pokmon wandered away and i saw it come inside the windworks.  oh, pokmon, eh .  yes, sir.  marill.  all right, these monitors will give you a perfect view of every inch of this building.  magnemite . magnemite .  no, hold on.  these young people don't mean any harm.  magnemite . magnemite .   let's see...  marill .   ahh.  that's the basement storage room.  'kay, let's go now.  hold on.  magnemite, make sure you don't attack them while they're down there in the basement.  please inform the other magnemite as well.  magnemite. magnemite.  thanks so much.  we'll leave when we find marill.  you can count on us.  make it quick.  so for now i'll just get back to that nap.  right.   how could we manage to put together a powerful machine like this and not be able to power it .   my bad.  charging stuff up ain't my thing.   but happening upon this windworks was a stroke of luck.  though those magnemite can be a real shocker.  electric jerks.   and in we go.  that should do it.  how long do you think it will take 'til we're fully juiced up .  several hours if magnemite don't charge us.  marill .  pip, piplup.  cyndaquil.  cyn.  marill, where are you .  marill .  ma, marill .  aww.  i told you not to wander off by yourself.  marill.  that's a relief.  now let's get out of here.  drat.  this is taking longer than getting my hair done.  it's time to put the pedal to the metal.  shezam .    huh .  now what .  piplup. cyndaquil, cyndaquil.   if you don't want your hair to stay that way permanently, i wouldn't do that again.  point well taken.  we don't wanna fry our new toy.  meanwhile, let's put our frizzy heads together and figure out a plan to catch pikachu.   what in the world .   nothing .  the door .  yeah, it won't even move.  it's possible the power outage might have caused a full lockdown.  oh, no.  does that mean we can't get out of here .   piplup .  piplup, is that you .  piplup, piplup. quil, quil.   hang in there, okay .  cyndaquil, cynda, cyndaquil.  pip, piplup .  pikachu, aim your thunderbolt at the door .  pika... chu .  piplup .  lup.   zip.  pika.  i've got it.  let's wave at the security camera.     do you think maybe no one's in the security room anymore .  or do you think he's still napping .  man, that's all we need.  guess we have no choice but to wait.  what are we gonna do if he never sees us .  come on, khoury, what're you talking about .  what if that security guard leaves without noticing us and goes off on a long vacation or something .  that means one thing.  we're gonna be stuck in this tiny room for the rest of our lonely, frustrated and pathetic little lives .  for some reason i think a positivethinking course would do a world of good for khoury, you know .  there's got to be a way.  hmm, ash, up there.  is that a ventilation shaft .  that's it.  okay, let me check this out.  be careful, ash.  right .   pika, pika.  don't worry, i'm fine.  i guess if we're all gonna spend the rest of our lives in here, i'll get married here.  huh .  i've got three choices.  um, what're you talking about .  khoury, he's out of the question.  hey, dane, is ash your boyfriend .  huh, ash ..  nono way.  hmm...  ash is quite a catch, don't you think .  really .  come on, if you had to choose between the three, who would it be .  never thought of it.  wow, dane, i would think that's the first thing you'd be thinking about.  it's super narrow.  i definitely won't fit in there.   pika, pika.  pikachu, pika.  pikachu, are you saying you'll go in .  pika, pika .  pi, pi, pi.  tell the security guard we're locked in.  pika, pika.  you can do it .  quil.  cyndaquil.  piplup.  cyndaquil.  quil.  cyndaquil.  cyndaquil.  pikachu.  pika, pika.  pikachu.  quil, cynda .  i need food.  a windworks has to have edibles.  let's let our tummies do the walking and comb the joint.  a chargedup machine's nice, but a chargedup jessie totally rules.  then search we shall.  ready or not...   whoa, he's out.  look, on screen.   it's pikachu.   twerp pokmon, too.   and twerps.  who knew .  huh, i wonder if those bubble brains locked themselves in there.  it's their nature, of course.  though pikachu et al seem free as a breeze.  let's breeze in and grab the jailbreakers quick.  quil, quil, quil, quil, quil, quil, quil.  pika.  quil, cynda .  hmm... i hope you like nets, dear pikachu.  as well as cyndaquil and piplup, too.  pika .  so in you go .  back here, cowards .   accept your twerpish fate, fools .  magnemite. magnemite.   magnemite. magnemite.  wobbuffet, mirror coat.  wobbu .  magnemite. magnemite.  all right, grotle, i choose you .  grotle .  now let's see if grotle can open that door.  but wait.  pikachu just went to let the security guard know we're trapped.  yeah, but i'm still thinking we should try everything.  see, i'm not such a big fan of waiting around.  ash is such a dependable guy.  don't you think, dane .  huh .  grotle, energy ball, let's go.  grotle .     grotle, return .  so much for grotle's energy ball.  hey, give me a shot.  all right, girafarig, come on out and use double hit on that locked door now .  rig .  no use.  khoury, give it a try.  believe me, if your pokmon couldn't open it, my pokmon won't be any help at all.  you're always so negative.  it drives me crazy.   hey, come on, come back .  slow down, cool it, stop .  pikachu's doing the best it can to help us.  but i can't sit around and wait .  so determined.  truth is, determination is one of ash's best attributes, after all.  khoury, you could learn a thing or two from that guy, you know.  he has won seven badges.  come on, why bother trying to do the impossible .   nah, don't worry.  a little bit of pain's not stopping ash.  that's for sure.  awesome, i can't believe it.  ash is the best.  the best .  hey, ash, take a break.  i guess you're right.  the charms, they're swirled.   did you see that.  over there.  what's happening.  whoa.   whoa.  with these new swirled charms, i can teleport.  new swirled lucky charms, part of a complete breakfast.  discover the magic...  of teleporting.  ] speed.  that's what the new superfast pullback racers are all

them .  it's seven divided by five, i think.  that's 1 and 2/5.  or 1.4.  okay, how're we gonna do 1.4 .  since it's ladies first, that means dane and i get two each, and that means you guys get one each.  dane, here you go.  ladies first.  uh, i feel kinda bad.  nah, it's fine.  man, that lyra always comes out on top.  well, let's eat.  pikachu .   pika, pika . piplup .  quil.  pip.  pikachu and

your journey.  well, see you.   he sleeps well.   wow, it's already dark.  yeah, but we found marill and that's what counts.  pika, pika.  what's that thing ..   all charged up with somewhere to go.   we keep going and going.  it's team rocket .  oh, no, again .  now hear this.  take a substantial gander at the beauty and durability of our new toy.  isn't it stunningly fabulous .  we spared no expense in order to give our machine the realistic but durable look of lovely lava.  it's a juice user, but big deal .  besides, that shell on its back is the battery pack.  and what's a few zillion charging hours with a dream machine like ours .  fire the magcargo cannon, bang, bang.   yipes .  that blast left our electricity reserves on a little more than empty .  all that charging for one zap .  okay, that's it.  pikachu, quick, use thunderbolt.  pikachu .  you'd think with all the dough we spent on a battery, i would've insulated it.  and while you were at it, knucklehead, you could've made it rechargeable from things like pikachu's thunderbolt.   ow .  we've had more than our share of volts, haven't we .  hey, bummer juice doesn't fill up our tummies.  bummer your tummy's just as empty as that horribly hollow head.   we're blasting off again .  after another excursion away from lyra by marill, operation valleywindworks rescue proves a resounding success, and our heroes'
