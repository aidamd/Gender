 all lackadaisical.  come on.  young man, i'd like my bags taken up to my room.  young man. wake up.  everybody's turning into mellowtrons or something.  watch it. coming through.  last one in the pool is a rotten bologna sandwich crawling with maggots.  well, almost everyone.  wait, spinelli. i hate bologna.  and chlorine turns my hair green.  and maggots are icky.  tourists.  come on, stitch. stitch.  we really should be heading over to the observatory.  come on, gretch.  don't be such a wet blanket, for crying out loud.  we're on vacation here. let's have some fun.  actually, spinelli, none of you are here for leisure.  convinced the unit of concerned brainy kids that you should all escort me to kauai as my 5 astronomy assistants.  yeah. good one, teej.  hey, i'd say just about anything for a chance to goof off in paradise.  indeed.  our locale brings to mind the great john milton, whose epicparadise lost i intend to read cover to cover during our sojourn here.  hey, has anyone seen my fruity drink.  it's the one with the paper umbrella.  aah. some weird monkey has my drink.  stitch, give the nice boy back his pineapple pizzazz.  sorry about that.  my dog's got some personal space issues.  hey, you're a local kid.  what do you do for fun on this rock.  um, well, lots of stuff.  "of eden, where delicious paradise, now nearer, crowns with her enclosure green" and fruity drinks reign supreme.  i penned that last part.  hoo chi fah.  oh, no.  what in the name of finster's support hose just happened.  he's here. everybody duck.  who's here.  ..pet.  ..lax.  he got loose, and i've got to catch him before he zaps anyone else.  lax. zaps.  you see, gretch.  the real excitement isn't up in space.  it's right here, on good old planet earth.     625, can't you hear the container computer blaring.  didn't want to disturb your private time.  you always notify me when another experiment has been activated.  warning, experiment 285 activated.  primary function: causes enemies to abandon work.  hey, hey. there's one you don't need.  you never work.  oh, sorry.  i mean, you never get paid.  'cause you never catch any experiments.  once hamsterviel's locator satellite is online, those days will be a distant memory.  locator satellite.  that is correct, you lazy yet culinarily inclined mutant.  it is my latest technological brainstorm, and it should be ready very soon.  ha ha ha.  once it is, finding any activated experiment will be as easy as stealing food pellets from a baby, don't ya know.  ha ha ha.  well, what are you waiting for.  go capture that experiment, fishy fish.  the satellite isn't working just yet.  until it is operational, you hunt experiments the oldfashioned way.  what, badly.   yes, sir.  don't hurry back.  i'm gonna be kicking it and listening to tunes.  see here, spinelli, i hardly think the mischief of some bizarre pet outweighs the possible discovery of a new planet.  using the island's highpowered telescope, i hope to prove that the object i saw from my garage observatory wasincredibly boring.  no offense, gretch, but we're on vacation.  we'd have more fun chasing down lax for lulu over here.  it's lilo, and stitch and i can catch him ourselves.  it's like our job.  there he is. he's up in that tree.  hey, you dumb zapper.  you can't outrun vince lasalle.  i'll shimmy up there and grab him.  somebody say ready, setchill.  that fiend.  what's he done to our pal.  he'll be ok.  he's not hurt or anything.  .. on vacation.  look, lilo, i don't know what kind of creature that is up there, but it zapped two of my friends, don't worry, stitch and i will catch him.   um, your stitch is on vacation.  you're gonna need reinforcements.  but i can't be responsible for your safety.  hey, no problem.  that's what finster's for.  what's a finster.  miss finster, our faculty chaperone.  a lot of good she'll do us.  she hasn't left the spa since we got to the hotel.  oh, rolf.  nobody can massage that deep tissue like you.  rolf me, baby. rolf me.  ung.  oh, mister, you just doubled your tip.  all right, let's do this.  i'm t.j.  that's vince, spinelli, gus, gretchen, and mikey's on the raft.  ha ha ha.  san zup. vap. vap. vap.   hey surfers, we're going behind the scenes  of the latest disney movie.  .movie surfers.  hey surfers, welcome to new orleans.  that's right, it's where the new animated adventure the princess and the frog comes alive.  you will enjoy. i guarantee.  so why set the movie here.   well the animators needed a city where alligators love jazz.  .jazz trumpet.   humans get transformed into frogs.  that's new.  and magical adventures might be waiting just around the corner.  new orleans is a wonderful city.   it was a city that lent itself to the magic and the mystery  and the music that we wanted to incorporate.   which is perfect for telling a fairy tale story.  it's beautiful, no.  there's no other place like new orleans.   wow, it's wonderful.  new orleans is also the home of mardis gras.   and elaborate costume balls.   it's a city where anything can happen.  and the food is amazing.  order up.  what just happened.  which makes this city perfect for tiana, the movies hard working heroine.  the princess's ultimate goal is to have her own restaurant.   but she wants to do it her way, and on her terms.  .i'm almost there.  her philosophy is you gotta make your own fairytales come true.   certainly, she's not a character who's waiting  for a prince to rescue her.  so when prince naveen comes around it leads to a whole lot of things that she didn't expect.  you must kiss me.  excuse me.  please, it will make me human.  just one kiss.  unless you beg for more.   so one little tiny kissleads to one masisve adventure.  what did you do to me.   they end up going on a journey together.   it's so much fun.  i could use a little help.  oh, i will play a little louder.  where y'all going.  find someone to break this spell.  the only thing important is what's under the skin.  the princess is what you have inside.  and you can do anything that you set your mind to.   whatever it is that makes your pulse race faster.  go for it.  yeah, you know it.   well surfers, that's just a taste of new orleans and  disney's the princess and the frog  in theaters now.  lilo: we gotta figure out how to catch him without getting zapped ourselves.  if i get any lazier than i already am, i'll forget to breathe.   hey.  hey, what you kids doing down there.  keep moving, mister. keep moving.  hey, you don't have to tell me twice.  if i don't get this food out to the cabana, my boss is gonna eat me forah, lunch.  gretchen, i've scoured my databanks, and i haven't found any record of a creature that can focus a beam of energy that causes one to stop working.  it's astounding.  indeed, galileo.  it strikes me as very odd, as well.  lilo, if i may be so bold, this creature isn't, well, of this earth, is it.  well, not exactly.  i knew aliens existed. i just knew it.  please, gus, we kind of try to keep a lid on the whole "aliens on earth" thing.   so what's the plan, lilo.  i think i have an idea.  um, do you mind.  oh, that's weird. i really don't.  i can use this to deflect lax's ray, but i could use a diversion.  good thinking. spinelli, let's go.  aye, aye, teej.  go. go. go.  lilo, forget it. lax is down.  spinelli: he's heading for the golf course.  i don't know what got into that caddy of ours.  imagine, making us carry our own clubs.  lilo: sorry.  there's lax.  and there's stitch. stop him, stitch.  your shot.  where are you, trog.  ow.  hmm, satellite's still not online. huh.    he cut right in front of me.  arrest him.  me. you were speeding, lady.  work it out, brother. i'm on a break.  a long break.  285 has been here.  the satellite. it's online.  it looks like it's the end of the line for the cart, guys.  aba tooka.  how fortuitous.  he's led us directly to the observatory.  perhaps we could throw the creature off balance by rotating the building underneath it.  a rotating building. cool.  be still my heart.  the stellarscope 997b.  isn't she beautiful.  uh, yeah.  how do we move the building.  lilo: get ready to catch him.  ha ha ha.  it's not working.  come on, teej, me and you.  guys. no.  as long as i'm here, it can't hurt to try to make some observations.  declination, plus 60.  right ascension, minus 20.  oh, my gosh. there it is.  lilo, come look at a new planet in our solar system.  new planet.  does this thing have a focus.  here.  that's no planet.  that's a gerbilshaped satellite.  a what now.  a satellite. gerbilshaped.  with words on the side.  "hands off, loser life form.  "experiment locator.  "property of dr. j. v. hamsterviel.  this satellite is not gerbilshaped, " let me see that.  loser life form is right.  some discovery i made.  it is important.  hamsterviel is an evil alien rodent.  we've gotta take it down.  i was under the impression you islanders were easygoing.  stitch, i know you're on vacation, but i need you.   gus.  i tried to stop 'em. i really did.  hey, teej, i found another pretty pink shell.  the two of them, they just lost their heads.  they didn't stand a chance.  they didn't stand a chance.  hee hee hee.  aah. aah.  if we can't figure out a way to destroy hamsterviel's evil satellite circling earth, he'll be able to capture and control hundreds of alien experiments.  and at that point, gus, i don't think any of us stand a chance.  announcer:" the ultimate thrill ride through the world of disney.  we're hitting the field for some sports highlights.  hits mcgee has the ball.  oh, and they're getting their head in the game.  he could go all theblam.  that's what i call a dog pile.  let's check out the instant replay.  the goofball's got the ball.  blam.  there's no "i" in blam.  here's the pitcher, and there's the windup.  ooh, and i wonder how this is gonna wind up.  blam.  he should wind down.  blam.  now that's flat out embarrassing.  batter up.  way up.  hey, hot pants.  either this is extreme baseball or they should fire their batboy.  let's check out the instant replay.  he's heading to first, and then he slips on a bat.  ooh, he slips on another bat.  and then he's got a bat in his mouth.  and then he does a flip.  ooh, he's got 2 bats in his mouth, a flip, then he flips.  then add a bucket. he's safe.  ..ive.  that's gonna hike up your shorts.  cannonball.  blam.  even the cheerleaders are getting in on the action.  we've got blam, yes, we do.  we've got blam. how about you.  blam, blam, blam, blam. blam. yay, blam.  remember, don't try this at home, " take that, you sand castle builders.  get 'em.  hamsterviel's about to take over the galaxy, and everybody's on vacation.  looks like it's up to us three to stop that satellite.  but how.  lax has got us trapped in this observatory.  perhaps galileo has some ideas.  actually, gretchen, i've been searching online scientific libraries, and i've begun to develop a plan of action.  watch out.  thankfully the fall doesn't seem to have damaged galileo's processor.  galileo, you were just about to tell us your plan.  don't ask me. i'm clocked out, babe.  hey, did you know i have solitaire loaded on here.  galileo never calls you babe.  my computer's on vacation now, too.  but that's impossible.  ..  unless the ray works on machines, too.  and that gives me an idea.  if we could get lax to fire his ray through that telescope, it might make the satellite go on vacation.  it's certainly worth a try.  it will require some sophisticated calculations, which, thanks to lax having disabled galileo, i must now do by hand.  now all we gotta do is catch lax.  whoa. aah.  hey. whoa.  hey, guys.  who wants to play lax golf.  it's a new game. it's fun.  the object is to hit golf balls at the alien experiment up on top of the observatory.  first kid to knock him off the roof wins.  obviously, that kid's gonna be me.  ha ha.  excuse me.  fore.  huh.  thank you.  it's ok, don't be scared.  we just wanna catch you and use you to make an evil satellite go on vacation.  lilo, i've very nearly figured out the vectors we'll need to disable the satellite.  no.  oh, my.  gretchen, please tell me ..  before youno, i'm afraid i haven't.  we're doomed.  but it shouldn't take me very much longer.  i just need to tweak these coordinates a bit.  but you got zapped by lax.  don't you wanna give up doing any work and goof off.  gracious, no.  for me, work is fun.  ..fun.  if one views their work as fun, one's life is more rewarding, less stressful.  akin to, well, recess.  like turning an experiment hunt into a golf game.  help. help.  hey, lax. over here.  uhoh.  aka tookie.  stitch, you saved me.  yeah. big fun.  people, we had better move if we want to destroy that satellite.  we just need your lazy ray for one minute.  ready, gus.  all set here. gretchen.  i never wished to apply my knowledge to the advancement of weaponry, but, in this case, i'll make an exception.  lax, fire at will.  lilo: it's working.  getting warmer, warmer.  what theooh. wow.  cool.  no.  it would seem that our plan has proven extremely effective.  thanks, gretchen.  the whole universe owes you big time.  you, too, little guy.  thanks.  cowabunga.  well, well, well.  it's beautiful.  and it couldn't have happened to a nastier guy than hamsterviel.  i'll tell him you said that.   let me guess, another alien.  silence.  i'll just be taking the experiment now, andaah.   hide and seek   not it.  i'm glad lax's ray finally wore off, and you guys are back to normal.  did you end up finding a good home for lax.  yeah, i think he's gonna be real happy.  hey, keep those stinking things away from me.  hey, would you people mind.  i'm on an important business call here.  yeah, j.b. i'm still here.  i can be reached all week.  no. no. no. i hate the beach.  there's no fax machine out there.  heh heh. sacha.  huh.  ..  i'm on vacation.  stitch and i are really gonna miss you guys.  hey, why don't you come back with us.  sorry, we've got a kitchen to go clean up.  we're gonna make a game out of it.  um, guys, i hate to spoil our little goodbye party, but where the hang is finster.  muriel, shouldn't you check in on those kids of yours.  quiet.  we don't mention those miscreants on spa premises.  sorry, muriel.  rolf, you got a set of palms on you.  ooh, baby.  no wonder they call this place paradise.  captioning made
