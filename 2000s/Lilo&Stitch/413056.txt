 unmitigated evil.  why don't you tell us how you really feel, blubber buns.  good always triumphs over evil, and i am good, very good, therefore i will get that experiment.  i'll believe it when i see a pod in your flipper.  until then, i'll be here, kickin' it with my sandwich pals.  that reminds me: i haven't packed any food.  you and your pals will accompany me today.  note to self: only open mouth to insert sandwiches.  why is small, isolated land mass called "forbidden island".  it's probably got some kind of ancient evil mojo tiki curse or something.  huh. ridiculous.  there's no such thing as an evil curse.  famous last words.  ahsoo. yecch.  goodo nim nisah.    heh heh heh heh heh.  aahgnnnrrr.   ahh.  huh.  pleakley: according to my research, niihau is the most unspoiled of the hawaiian islands, untouched by civilization and modernization.  ..  in my new safari disguise.  60% off at the papaya republic.  jumba, i thought we were packing light.  did pack light.  only essential essentials for essential purposes.  gunh.  rest, relaxation, and readiness center.  complete experiment archives with tracking array.  heh heh.  plays dvds, too.  sweet.  nana gatay.   maka maka. ozata.  what's your hurry.  miya krista.  gantu.  we're not after big, tall, and ugly.  let's just concentrate on getting the pod before he does.  ok.    jumba and pleakley.  gantu.  jumba.  pleakley.  forbidden island, huh.  tough sell for the tourists.  maybe you should rename it something like, oh, i don't know, "come get yourself blown up" island.  aaah.    what happened.  fireballs rained from sky.  blew up everything real good.  is very odd weather, even for cursed island.  huh. what's this.    hmm.  weaponsgrade plasma.  was no accident.  we were attacked.  now, who do we know who uses plasma as a weapon.  uhoh.  grrr. naga dah miza krista. gantu.  with gantu's evil ways, 626 is fed up to here.  or maybe only here.  it's hard to translate.  ..  remember how i said maybe gantu has good in him somewhere.  maybe he just needs some hugs.  chibbi chiva.  626 has no time for the huggyhugging.  he's off to defeat gantu with, how do you say, ruthless and extreme prejudice.  stitch, wait.  aa katah.  why am i covered with slobber.  hey, i see you caught an experiment.  what. where.  gotcha.  ha ha ha ha.  ah, you're way too easy, g.  ..did you find anything.  only ocean and a wall of rock.  the trog probably got to the experiment first.   hey, is that the experiment.  ha ha. very funny.  no, no, no. i mean it.  i'm not falling for it.  you weren't kidding.  unh. unh.  figured that out by yourself, did ya, fish flanks.  my blaster.  cheesy.  you'll make it.  some fresh lettuce, a mayo infusion, and you'll be fine.  noooooo.  who would do this.  who would have the glamyevs to take out our camp.  only one creature in the universe, the abomination.  he has been a barnacle on my back long enough.  i am going to destroy him.  vizi tah.  excellent. you're mine, trog.  maga taaah.  no.  don't worry.  626 is absolutely, completely indestructible.  almost.  unnngghh.  rrrowr. rrrowwr.  evil little monstrosity.  suu negel sa jasa miga.  lilo: stop.  neither of you did anything.  .. splodyhead up there.  grrrazza.  pleakley: what is thata bad mojo spirit.  a tiki cave demon.  ahh. is my experiment 619.  thought i recognized boomboom plasma ball stylings.  619.  hello.  please, no more shooting at evil genius creator.  aw. 619 always had attitude problem.  attitude adjustments are our specialty.  get him, stitch.  uhh. migabiga.  oh, no, you don't.  heh heh. heh heh.  why are you laughing.  well, because 619 is excellent evil genius work.  vicious, relentless, inexhaustible firepower.  we could be trapped here for years.  ha ha ha ha ha.  hate it when evil is biting self in foot.  we're all going to end up like little charred pieces of toast.  toast. mmm.  kita makuda.  i only retreated because you did.  ok, things are not working out like we planned, but they could be worse.  worse than being trapped under this rock and stranded on this accursed island.  without food and water.  don't forget, 619 is waiting to blast us to pieces.  and the sun is going down.  well, we could have the mumps.  we just gotta think.  we're gonna need food and warmth to survive, so we all need to work together.  hmph.  naga. togata.  626 refuses to cooperate with evil sharklike behemoth.  he says he will provide food and warmth.  i won't accept help from an abomination.  as the member of a superior species, i will do it myself.  ow.  hmph.  heh heh heh heh.  hey, hey, hey, looks like we got a little survival challenge.  gantu versus my cuz, teteatete, mano a mano, which means we don't have to do a thing.  tada. ha ha.  food. the little monster got food.  waah.  ohh. ohh. ohh.  behold.  i, gantu, the great provider offer youhey. oohwah.  byebye.  so much for dinner.  maybe we can at least have a fire.  ha ha ha ha ha.  arrrrrowwrr.  nice work, guys.  now it's dark, and we're all cold and hungry.  and cursed. don't forget cursed.  and it's all because you both think the other guy is evil.  now, waitnot meat least my evil genius experiment has not attacked for some time.  sorry, but he is designed for to cause mayhem and misery.  at least he has an excuse.  next big thing.  listen to radio disney and go to radiodisney.comto make your

go to radioxdisney.com to make your pick.  lilo.  anybody.   lilo.  nani. it's david.  you still coming by to help set up the luau.  ohh. lilo went to niihau with the aliens.  she was supposed to be home by now, but of course she isn't.  ..  rescue mission.  bingo.  why doesn't splodyhead just come down here and splode us.  because now he is outnumbered.  but 619 is singleminded and relentless in blasting of targets.  are we supposed to feel better.  only probably saying sooner or later 619 will pick us offone by one.  one by one.  marking us each for a fiery demise till one of us is left all alone.  well, it won't be me.  isn't that right, coco.  coco here was raised on the forbidden isle and knows the secrets of its evil curse.  strange fruit has secret information.  let me see. give me that.  stay away from coco.  we have a plan.  we're not staying here a second longer.  run, coco, run.  escape the forbidden island.  ohh, the indignity.  and the evil curse.  forget the curse.  splodyhead is going to barbecue us unless we put our differences aside and come up with a plan.  fine. but i will lead us.  naga. me go.  follow coco, and ye shall have salvation.  we'll take a vote.  raise your hand if you want gantu to be boss.  yes. i am in the lead.  raise your hands if you want stitch to be boss.  sorry, big guy, but that vote only counts as one.  it's a tie.  i nominate the little girl.  .  hey, come on, kid's got her act together.  ..  coco and i have changed our minds.  we vote to choose lilo.  looks like we got a winner.  listen here, a former captain of the galactic alliance will not take orders from a newly hatched earthborn.  i demand a recount.  sorry, gantu.  our tribe has spoken.  ohh, blitsnak.  ok, splodyhead must have some weakness, like stitch with water.  jumba.  ahh, water.  yes.  perhaps if 619's nose gets wet, no more fire for little while.  all right, splodyhead won't come down till he thinks it's safe.  so here's what we're gonna do.  we'll have to work together.  all right, steady now, cousin.  come on, come on, don't drop it.  chopchop, spanky.  unnggh.  that's it, big g.  come on, this is a team effort.  put your gills into it.  yes, coco, i know this would work better with real knitting needles, but we're a little bit stranded on a desert island right now.  hey, come on, easy does it, monocle face.  the team's right here with ya.  especially him.  he's big enough to be a team all on his own.  hah. oh, i slay me.  seriously, though, good work.  ..  do something really easy.  never mind.  that is the best thingamabob i ever saw.  and the beautiful part is we did this as a team.  everyone contributed.  are you feelin' the love here.  everyone contributed except you.  and what we need now is a decoy.   yeah, sorry, not love. might've been heartburn.  oh, would you look at the time.  heh hehaah. oh.  arrrrowwwrr.  625, as if reciting: oh, joy of joys.  we are all escaping aboard this makeshift raft now.  that firespitting cave rat could not possibly stop us.  ..we're outta here.  ha ha ha ha ha.  nahha ha ha hah.  surprise.  waaaaah.  gotcha. aya taba.  o brave coco.  your sacrifice shall not be in vain.  if he reaches that cave and dries off, we're finished.  creecha. manjai.  that's crazy.  just crazy enough to work.  hunhrah.  neeeaaah.  oof. gotcha.  nice rescue.  well, but that was purely about catching splody, uh, this experiment.  any rescuing was coincidence.  but you and stitch got a cool frankenstein and the wolfman teamup thing going together.  itaba kinika.  out of my face, trog.  we're not a team, and i win this round.  i'm gonna punch you so hard.  gantu good.  somewhere.  muta hagata.   yeah.  maybe in his toe.  ah, stitch, i'm so proud of you.  oh.  over here.  get us off this cursed, evil forbidden rock.  sorry we're late for dinner.  and there was evil and a curse.  andsave it.  just get onboard.  don't mind if i do.  but i think someone my size will need both those vehicles.  now, don't make me stomp you to get them.  abata iki.  ..  i know there's good in you, gantu.  but as long as you act like a bad guy, stitch and me are gonna treat you like a bad guy.  eh.  you're not gonna leave us here, are ya.  all alone.  .  we'll give you a ride.  you just have to give us splodyhead as payment.  nnnnrunnhhh.  you did it, coco.  you finally escaped the forbidden island, though not its evil curse.  not its evil curse.  niihau is not called forbidden because of a curse.  it's forbidden because you need an invitation to visit.  .  of course. i knew it all the time.  good job, splodyhead.  you and the luau are gonna get along just fine.  what can i say.  .. well done.  captioning made possible bydisney channel department of education captioning performed
