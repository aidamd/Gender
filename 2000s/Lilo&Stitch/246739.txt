 ohh.  did you find a new job.  oh, not yet.  i'll try again tomorrow.  i took the liberty of looking for one for you.  there's lots of jobs with great potential out there.  i circled them, see.  or how about this one.  "university wants subjects for scientific " maybe you'd get superpowers.  thanks. i'll look at it later.  i'm sorry me and stitch melted a hotel and got you fired.  are you mad.  nah. no use crying over spilled milk.  it's not like i can change what happened.  no, but i can.  lilo: we're gonna fix this.  this time, we're gonna have a plan so we get it right.  ok, this is you, and this is me.  stitch, car.  fine. you be the car.  vroom. vroom.  rrrrrrr. vrooooom.  stitch. pay attention.  we have to get it all perfect this time.  humpf.  ..  this is you,this is me, and this is the experiment.  if the experiment goesinside the hotel again, you don't follow itinto the lobby.  instead, you go over the roof like you did the first time.  got it.  stitch: roof. ehh.  meanwhile, i'll make witty conversation with keoni.  ehh. huh.  since we're going back anyways, i figure i could do it even better this time.  whatever.  whoa.  cowabunga.  whoa. uhh.  aah. ooh. ahh.   ok, you go that way.  i stand here and look pretty.  cousin.  'sup, lilo.  hah kata.  too bad this tree got the dry rot.  just make sure it falls away from the parking lot.   cousin.  yaah.  hey, you want to get some .  oh, no.  this lolo dog jumped on the tree, threw off the weight.  ..  ok, let's do this again, but this time, don't knock over the tree, and i'm going to try a more casual approach with keoni.   'sup, lilo.  nothing.  fascinating weather we're having, isn't it.    aah.   oh, no.  hey, wanna get some shave ice.  i get a discount at the hotel.  sure.   what. hey.  one more time.  whoa.  cowabunga.  whoa. aah.  aah. ooh. ahh.   ohh.  uhoh. uhoh.  someone forgot to switch on someone forgot to switch on the paradox inhibitor. the paradox inhibitor.   'sup, lilo.  yow.  uhoh.  hey, wanna get some shave ice.  i get a discount at the hotel.  maybe next time.    hey.   lilo: ok, here'swhat we have to avoid: the cruise shipcrashing into the hotel, us running intoourselves, and a giant tidal wavehitting the island.  maybe we're not going back far enough.  let's go back 5 minutes further.  ok.  whoa.  cowabunga.  uhoh. you turned the dial the wrong way.  instead of going backward, you went forward, way forward.  we better get back to 12:00.  uhhuh.  jumba: experiment 626.  huh.  you're alive.  uhh.  hmm.  was that my timesurfing board.  'sup, lilo.  'sup, keoni.  you know.  totally.  later, lilo.  later.  stitch: lilo.  i talked to keoni, ..   lilo:..  lilo: and i'm not under arrest.  it worked.  let's go home before we mess anything else up.  oketaka.   what was that.  hey, rip van fishead, you have a good nap.  mmm. wonderful.  anything happen while i was asleep.  ah, the usual.  i made sandwiches. an experiment was activated.  nothing new, really.  .   hello.  nani.   pleakley: she's at work.  lift your leg.  then everything is back to normal.  whaah.  give me that melting experiment, trog.  oh, no.  we messed it up again.  gantu didn't show up last time we did this.  now what do we do.  waah. ikka patooka.  hah. good one, stitch.  ..where's melty.  uhoh.  uhh. how kind of you to invite me in, trog.   have fun cleaning up the mess.  so we go back one more time andaah. time machine.  so we melted the time machine, and our house is gone, and gantu took the experiment, but at least nani kept her job.  lilo, i just lost my job.  what happened to the house.  i just don't have the tools for this.  i'm going to the store for a wetdry vacuum.  gantu showed up at the hotel looking for melty.  showed up and wrecked it.  jameson had to close the hotel and lay off all the staff till it's repaired.  i'm gonna go make sure pleakley doesn't spend all my savings.  this is all my fault.  if i hadn't gone back in time to keep from embarrassing myself in front of keoni, this would have never have happened.  yes. your fault.  what's that.  i have arrived to save your behinds.  jumba. you brought us a new time machine.  it has taken me decades to realize what happened here so long ago.  from the day i showed you my timesurfer, fabric of time was altered.  house melted, our little family broken beyond repair.  i lost 2 of my eyesights and yecch.  don't even asked what happened to pleakley.  it was not until i saw you surfing through time that i was adding 2 and 2.  i'm sorry i ruined the future.  little girl, you can fix everything, but only one way.  you must go back to beginning and relive it exactly as it originally happened.  you mean, i'll have to humiliate myself in front of keoni.  a broken time strand can only be repaired if relived exactly, but more important is accepting of your mistake.  if you are dwelling in the past, you cannot be living in present, and we lose sight of future.  now, get going before something melts this machine, too.  heh heh. go, go.  thanks, jumba.  good luck, little girl. heh heh heh.  what are you doing here.  i have come to give you warning.  whatever you do, do not build robot wife.  is too easy for them to hack into bank account.  aah.  ooh. ow.   make sure you do exactly like the first time.  huh.  here we go.  whoa.  ooh.  'sup, lilo.  are you all right.  hah kata.  let me give you a hand.  nnno. i'm ok.  ii meant to do that, ..  'cause i'm doing a hula about a mud monster.  huh. ok, see ya later.  and i had the most perfect first day of work ever.  i bet it was 'cause of that luck charm you gave me.  lilo, what's wrong.  i humiliated myself in front of keoni, and then i went back in time to fix it, but you lost your job, and i had to do it all over again and let myself fall in the mud in front of keoni.   i could have told you that you shouldn't go back in time.  you coulda.  sure, 'cause even if today was bad, the best thing to do is move on and try to do better tomorrow.  yeah. i kind of figured that out.  .   keoni.  what are you doing here.  i brought you something.   a monster. made of mud.  with a hula skirt.  that mud monster hula idea sounds totally rad.  hey, you want to go see a movie.  lilo, what's going on with stitch.  lilo: oh, stitch is protecting melty until we can take him to the aluminum recycling plant where he belongs, just in case gantu comes and rips the roof off like last time.  what last time.  ..i think it's best if we don't dwell on the past.  besides, gantu shouldn't show up, 'cause everything should be perfectly back to normal.   hey, sleepyhead. you have a good nap.  wonderful. anything happen while i was asleep.  i made sandwiches, etched a laser tattograph on your patookie.  nothing new, really.  you lasered my patookie.   you are one deep sleeper, my friend.  it's actually a wonderful likeness of moi.  you wanna see.  .   aah.  captioning made possible byabc cable networks group captioning performed bythe national captioning institute, inc.  . there's 104 days of summer vacation .  . till school comes along just to end it .  . so the annual problem for our generation .  . is finding a good way to spend it .  . like maybe .  . building a rocket or fighting a mummy .  . or climbing up the eiffel tower .  . discovering something that doesn't exist .  hey.  . or giving a monkey a shower .  . surfing tidal waves creating nano bots .  . or locating frankenstein's brain .  it's over here.  . finding a dodo bird painting a continent .  . or driving your sister insane .  phineas.  . as you can see there's a whole lot of stuff to do .  . before

awesome. grr.  come on, ferb. fire one off.   i wonder what that means.   hey, ferb, i know what we're gonna do today.  let's build a perry translator.  we can finally figure out what "grr" means.  some say he's just a mindless platypus, but he might actually be thinking some profound thoughts.  just like another quiet animal i know.   stacy, it's been four days.  i'm not expecting prince charming to bring me a glass slipper or anything, but a phone call would be nice.   i've got another call.  it's him. call you back. bye.  hello.  hey, candace. it's jeremy.  well, good morrow to you, sir.  huh.  heh. i mean, what's up.  i just got the new "destruction mayhem 3" game.  i thought maybe you'd like to come over and try it out.  oh, yeah.  you, me and little suzie playing a video game, huh.  suzie. no, she's at her friend's house.   oh. hold on, candace.  someone's at the door.   so video games.   all set over here.  okay. now all we need is our subject.  where's perry.   ah, there you are, agent p.  sorry about the lights.  we're using an alternative energy source and we haven't quite got it working smoothly yet.  i decided it was high time our operation went green.  all right, assignment, assignment, uh, let's see...  we're saving paper by printing on the same one over and over again, so, uh, sorry, for the life of me i can't make this out. hm...  well, i'm sure it says something about doofenshmirtz.  go get him.  for crying out loud, karl, peddle faster.  i gotta check my email.   phineas: perry.  oh. there you are.  come on, boy.  here, just take a seat.  stay.  all set.   okay, perry, it's time to hear what's on your mind.  hit me with your "grr" shot.  hey, phineas.  what you doing.  oh, ferb and i have invented a perry translator so we can finally figure out what he's saying.  that's great.  but don't you need perry to be here for it to work.  that was weird.  perry was here a second ago.  translator: i sure love worms.  don't look at me.  big, fat, juicy worms.   gotta find 'em.gotta eat 'em.  both: whoa.  hello, birdie, do you understand me.   aren't you a little young for interspeciel communication.  yes. yes, i am.  how about you, squirrel.  do you understand me.   oh, i do.  do you have any nuts for me.  that's so cute.  yeah, yeah, yeah, i'm cute, i'm cute.  now nut me.  wow.  this works on all animals.  hey, do you think it would work on my dog pinky.  he barks at the door when a doorbell rings on tv.  i'd love to explain the whole concept to him.  couldn't hurt to try.  great.  i'll be right back.  wow.  with a device like this, all animals can finally say what's on their minds.         i'm really glad you wanted to come over, candace.  most girls really aren't into stuff like this.  pssh. most girls.  i guess i'm just cool like that.  yup, love me my video games.  who's this.  yeah, that's suzie's dog.  who's a good girl.  who's a good girl. yeah.  who's the good girl.  who's the good.   obviously not me.  . doofenshmirtz out in the forest .   perry the platypus.  don't be shy.  it's just me. come here.  haha.  you like my new cage.  i got it from a secondhand sharksupply store.  it was half off, because, you know, something bit half of it off.  so here's my evil plan.  with this remote, i will open the danville dam, flooding all the streets and creating beautiful waterways.  like the canals in venice, italy.  or to a lesser extent, venice, california.  but how will people get around.  they will have to buy my latest invention.  it's like a car, but it can drive on the surface of water.  behold. you like it.  i call it the buoyancy operated aquatic transport, or boat for short.  everyone will want one.   yeah, i see what you're saying, but you don't have an argument.  they're giving you 12 cans a day.  technically, you're not underfed.  all right. next.   oh, yeah.  i've been getting a lot of complaints about the vacuum.  just let it out.  hey, look at this.  i'm getting the hang of it.  no, actually, candace, you just paused it.  and now you've reset the game.    oh, no. these were brand new.  hey, bad dog.  that's weird.  suzie trained her so well.  i see.  suzie trained her.  i can't believe this.  hey, that's my shoe.   uh, okay in there, candace.  candace: yeah, yeah. oh.  don't even think about it.    where's my shoe.  no, no, no.  hey, candace.  you ready for the third level.   candace.  phineas.  what's up.  okay, we've got 78 complaints about food quantity, 42 requests for belly rubs, and we're still trying to explain tv to pinky.  again, forget the idea of little people in there.  so, what exactly are we supposed to do with this information.  hmm.  okay, the jones' hamster says he's gonna lose it if someone doesn't oil the wheel in its cage.  hmmph.  well, what now.  that's what we'll do.  let's tell all the owners what their pets want.  starting with this little fella right here.   sorry. lady.  lady right here.  hey, candace.  what is going on here.  we made an animal translator.  we'll tell you about it later.  right now we're on a mission.  come on, guys.  see you, candace.  an animal translator.  i have had it up to here with stupid animals today.  why would you want to know what stupid animals are saying.  oh, i can tell you what they'll say.  i'm an animal and i bite my own heinie.  i've got a small cranial capacity.  look at me.  i don't have opposable thumbs.  i eat with my face.  i sweat through my tongue.  i'm a furry, fleabitten loser.  like any other animal on this planet.   get her.     . it's a perfect day .   )
