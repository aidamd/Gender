 errupt my slumber.  but i'm busy, sir, making repairs and whatnot.  make 625 do these jobs.  where is your leadership ability, you miserable excuse for a minion.  625 only makes sandwiches.  oh. well, perhaps you should be helping him.  you are demoted to 625's assistant until further notice.  have a tasty selection of sandwiches ready for me when i arrive.  wow, i've always wanted a sandwich prep assistant.  lilo: this is my new cousin.  his name is finder.  what, you didn't bring your weird dog to do tricks again.  not this time.  finder can find anything.  anyone missing something.  well, i lost my favorite hula floaty pin at the beach last week, and nobody turned it in to the lost and found.    he found it.  find my lip gloss.  i lost my notebook.  my kitty is gone.    wow. wow. wow.  ok, lilo. thank you.  myrtle, you wanted to show us something today.  ..  i forgot to bring it.  but that's it behind your back, right.  ..ok.  this is my doll shirley.  she's studying to be a real estate agent.  i wonder if he could find my uncle jimbo.  excuse me.  i'm showing and telling here.  oh, he can find anything.   mmm.  ha ha ha. tata.   oh.   we really got myrtle good, didn't we.  who got myrtle good.  finder and me.  finder was a better show and tell than her boring old doll.  oh.  gloating isn't nice, lilo.  what's gloating.  gloating is when you're happy about being better than someone else, but in a mean way.  but myrtle does that all the time.  you wanna be like myrtle.  no.  hey, why do you look pretty.  i got a date.  david.  yep.  where are we going.  do i need to change, too.  no, because you're staying home with jumba and pleakley.   where are they.  i trust we will have your cooperation in this matter.  i will help in any way possible.  i can't believe it.  the grand councilwoman of the galactic federation never calls us unless intergalactic annihilation is just around the corner.  .  first step is regaining composure and letting go of me.   he found you.  what's wrong, jumba.  hamsterviel has escaped from prison.  the grand council woman called to warn us to be on lookout.  hamsterviel's loose. he could be anywhere.  mochica. bakasita.  we should use finder.  he was built for this job.  aaah. rrraah.  hey. where are you going.   626 is very competitive.  he is wanting to find hamsterviel himself.  well, i don't want stitch to go alone.  me and finder will follow.   we can't let her go without supervision.  hamsterviel's dangerousand we're babysitting.  heh heh. good point.  older sister's wrath is even more dangerous than hamsterviel.  heh heh heh.   hmm.  chikata.    what's wrong with him.  he says 626 is choosing wrong way.  ..  we'll follow finder.  oh.   aah.  stupid planet with annoying abundance of foliage.  ahhaha.   lilo: i think finder's got a scent.  myrtle: so you don't have anything that does tricks.  well, you could teach a puppy to do tricks.  who has time for that.  i need one that comes with tricks already installed.  the monkeys on this planet will crumble before my genius, and when i have conquered this watery rock, i will do away with its useless and puny woodlands.  oh, never in my life have iunh.  a talking gerbil.  i am not a gerbil.  and what are you staring at, you multipleeyed mophead.  have you never before seen a criminal genius.  unhand me, or i will have you ..  wait'll i take him to show and tell.  myrtle: lilo's gonna be green with envy when she sees you.  release me now, or you will face the wrath jock von hamsterviel, you orange crusted savage.  you're cranky.  here. aah.  have some gerbil pellets.  .. mmm. happy.  ..  milton.  i'm gonna go buy you some more gerbil stuff.   now is my chance to escape.    hey.  this is myrtle's house.  hmm. could finder make a mistake.  it is unusual, but possible.  well, there's one way to find out.  what are you doing here.  i was just wondering if you'd seen anything weird.  besides you.  more like an evil genius rodent.  oh. right.  please go away, count freakula.  guess finder made a mistake.   we'd better keep looking.   ..  lilo: it's ok.  you're still the best tracker on the island.  oh.  mmm.   barbarians at every turn.  myrtle:  how'd you get out of your cage.  i'd better lock it this time.   aha.    oh.  ..  logged.  myrtle: hi, milton.  i brought you a playpen.  see. it has a little slide and everything.  release me, you insufferableaah.  bleah.  isn't that fun.  wanna do it again.  no. i don't likewhoa.  ..  somewhat enjoyable.  perhaps, eh, once more.  wheeheeheehee. ha ha ha.  myrtle: mom.  yes, hon.  can i have a glass of water.  i have told you a million times to close your window.  ow.  and take that gerbil off the bed.  i am not a gerbil, you hideous masked matriarch.  what are you doing in there.  using my vast scientific knowledge to construct a shoulder plasma cannon.  now release me. i will ask only once.  very funny, milton.  i doubt you could make a plasma whatever out of yee.  a plasma cocktail, you scruffy savage.  oh.  ooh. ow.  what is going on here.  lilo's dog tried to steal milton, so he blasted him with his homemade pasta cannon.  plasma cannon. oh, it is ruined.  i'm calling animal control to pick up this dog.  no sign of him.  no. not even with my tracking experiment.  unfortunately, this means i'll need to take more drastic measures.  i don't understand it.  experiment 458 should have found hamsterviel easily.  lilo, there's a phone call for you from the animal shelter.  you're slicing them too thick.  you have to be able to fit it in your mouthwell, my mouth, which is much smaller than your grotesque maw.  now lay some mustard on me, baby.  computer:..  grand councilwoman of the galactic federation.  get out. oh.  gantu, i have an offer for you.  if you're successful, it could mean reinstatement of your captain's rank.  i'll do anything.  but you haven't heard what it is yet.  i don't care. lay some mustard on me, baby.  i mean, ma'am. terribly sorry.  please go ahead.  it's about the escaped dr. hamsterviel.  ..  associated with him.  but if you capture him and turn him over to us, all will be forgiven.   lilo: stitch.  stitch, what were you doing at myrtle's.   oh. hamsterviel.  you were trying to find hamsterviel without us.  but why.   'cause you wanted to find him before finder did.  i guess i kinda made you feel inferior, huh.  stitch, you're number one at so many things.  you shouldn't be upset if you aren't number one at everything.   ok. ok.  besides, finder made a mistake.  hamsterviel's not at myrtle's.   and i'm sort of the leader of these girls.  but sometimes, i think they don't even like me.  ah. that is your first mistake.  it doesn't matter if your minions like you.  they only need to fear you.  huh. i never thought about it that way.  now what.  gantu: i am here to apprehend you on orders of the galactic federation.  pleakley: slow down. i can't keep up.  ..  gantu.  ..  and he took myrtle, too.  if gantu attains his hyperdrive, all is lost.  now what do we do.    finder can fly.  aha. yes. i had almost forgotten.  was last minute addition in order to insure optimal tracking abilities.  tookie bah waba.  this looks familiar.  i cannot believe this aquatic excuse for a captain.  he has turned on me.  it's like you saidwhere's the loyalty.  gantu is a disgrace.  you, a mere child of a primate peoples, could do his job 100no, 1,000 times better.  i could.  believe me, you could.  perhaps when you have completed your education, you could come work for me.  hoo hoo ha ha.  computer: warning.  illegal genetic experiment on hull.  it's always something.  whoa.  whoa.  hey, cut it out, will ya.  i'm prone to vertigo.  computer, open window.  computer: window opening.  hey, what are youaah. aah.  get out there, and don't come back until you've knocked off that trog.  wait.  jakata quizda.  aah.  aah. unh.  all right. take it easy now.  heh heh. we're family, remember. heh.  ..  ow.  show off.  computer: warning. outage. crash is imminent.   now i won't be able to deliver hamsterviel to the councilwoman.  no need to worry about that.  i came to you. guards.  i fulfilled my part of the bargain.  i caught hamsterviel. where is my reward.  i suppose you dowhere's myrtle.  what is a myrtle.  she's a little girl like me.  gantu grabbed her when he took hamsterviel.  is this true.  well, i'm not sure. i haven't really looked.  i suppose it's possible.  so you put an innocent girl in danger.  you always did have a problem with ethics.  my offer is therefore rescinded.  let me go, you wretched olive shaped head woman with backwards legs.  the galactic federation thanks you for your help.  ..   stitch.  ..  if anyone deserves a reward hamsterviel, it is you.  hmm. finder did it.   yes, experiment 458 managed to track dr.  hamsterviel, but without your courage and daring, he would not have been apprehended.  but it's good of you to share the credit.  myrtle: what did you do with milton.  where's my talking gerbil.  excuse me, ms. grand councilwoman.  i have a favor to ask.   and when i escaped, i said, "eat my solar dust, you stinking pile " good boy.   a talking gerbil.  all: cool.  it's good to let other people have the limelight sometimes, isn't it.  uh.  i wonder how finder likes his new home.   captioning made possible byabc cable networks group captioning performed bythe national captioning institute, inc.  tookie bah waba.  hao.  iki bah bah.
