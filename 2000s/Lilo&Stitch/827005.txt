 , if i ever saw one.   aha. excellent. you have killed tree.  is christmas over now.  nothing to see here. everything's fine.  nani: what happened.  pleakley broke the christmas tree.  again. that's the third one.  we can't afford any more.  maybe we can fix it when i get home from work.  work. but you can't go.  it's christmas eve.  wong has me working double shifts bse of the holiday.  look, i promise i'll be home before too late.  but it's christmas.  we're supposed to have a tree.  pleakley: everything's under control.  i'll be the ee.  is he all right.  sometimes i wonder.  i'll be back before too long.  we'll still have christmas.   on the first day of christmas    i just made for me    a saaandwich   hey, flounderface, where you been.  grab a holiday hoagie and join the party.  you can waste your time with this ridiculous earth custom if you want, but for once, i have the upper hand.  hamsterviel's been on a rampage lately, but this should please him.  i've obtained a dormant experiment pod.  now, just hohohold on a minute, there, tuna toes.  you're not just going to transport that pod to hamsterviel, are you.  it's christmas.  everybody's giving each other gifts.  perhaps you're right.  if i wrap this up in holiday paper with a bow, it might get the little gerbil off my dorsal fin.  .. everyone likes getting presents, even megalomaniacal rodents with delusions of galactic domination.  hmm. i should get this wrapped.  ..  if you want to blend in out there.  you better put on a red suit and hat.  everyone's wearing them.  lilo: the best way to teach you about christmas is for you to see it firsthand, ..  is at the mall.  plus, they usually have free cheese log samples here, too.   hey, get out of here.  ahh, blah.   deck the halls with boughs of holly    fa la la la la la la la la    'tis the season to be jolly     fa la la la la la la la la     sweet merciful kringle.  you're naughty.  mele kelimal.   it's mele kalikimaka.  ..  you're suffering from what we in the kid biz refer to as the christmas crazies.  you've got to remember, if you're bad, santa won't bring you any presents.   aka tiki baba.  ohh.  what did we just talk about.  wah. uh, uh.  give it back.  aah.  mmm. ahh. zotno zibi. mm.  it's his first christmas.  he's a little excited.  aah.   what's gotten into you.  this is just like what happened with the pig at the luau.  he doesn't know what he's doing.  go easy on him this year.  and you'll notice, if you check your list, i'm the one being good, here.  i'm here to pick up a package i left to have wrapped.  i'm sorry, sir, but we had an accident.  a little blue accident.  hmm. was it an illegal genetic mutation.  ii mean, a naughty puppy.  puppy's not the word i would use.  that abomination 626.  it's time i made him part of christmas past.   hey surfers, we're going behind the scenes  of the latest disney movie.  .movie surfers.  hey surfers, welcome to new orleans.  that's right, it's where the new animated adventure the princess and the frog comes alive.  you will enjoy. i guarantee.  so why set the movie here.   well the animators needed a city where alligators love jazz.  .jazz trumpet.   humans get transformed into frogs.  that's new.  and magical adventures might be waiting just around the corner.  new orleans is a wonderful city.   it was a city that lent itself to the magic and the mystery  and the music that we wanted to incorporate.   which is perfect for telling a fairy tale story.  it's beautiful, no.  there's no other place like new orleans.   wow, it's wonderful.  new orleans is also the home of mardis gras.   and elaborate costume balls.   it's a city where anything can happen.  and the food is amazing.  order up.  what just happened.  which makes this city perfect for tiana, the movies hard working heroine.  the princess's ultimate goal is to have her own restaurant.   but she wants to do it her way, and on her terms.  .i'm almost there.  her philosophy is you gotta make your own fairytales come true.   certainly, she's not a character who's waiting  for a prince to rescue her.  so when prince naveen comes around it leads to a whole lot of things that she didn't expect.  you must kiss me.  excuse me.  please, it will make me human.  just one kiss.  unless you beg for more.   so one little tiny kissleads to one masisve adventure.  what did you do to me.   they end up going on a journey together.   it's so much fun.  i could use a little help.  oh, i will play a little louder.  where y'all going.  find someone to break this spell.  the only thing important is what's under the skin.  the princess is what you have inside.  and you can do anything that you set your mind to.   whatever it is that makes your pulse race faster.  go for it.  yeah, you know it.   well surfers, that's just a taste of new orleans and  disney's the princess and the frog  in theaters now.   ow.  grr. grr.   whew.  stitch.  ..  have you seen stitch.  he's up in the attic.  oh, and it looks like he did a lot of christmas shopping.  open up, you greedy little genetic mistake.  what's going on.  ah. little girl.  626 has many gifts that he is keeping to himself.  stitch. what are we going to do with you.  you've torn up half the town, stolen presents, made little kids cry.  it's like there's a spirit of christmas ruined.  i will teach him to share brightly wrapped goodies with evil genius who created him.  don't. there's something wrong with stitch.  he needs our help.  i know a secret way.  jumba: aha. i'm having you now.  stitch: aki taba.    tipata tu.  aha. got you.  jumba, look out.  ooh.  are you ok.  i'm ok.  i landed on my patooki.  ha haooh.  bad stitch.  now you're not going to get .. presents.  wow.  ah, we'll see who is being watched canine now, yes.  i can't hear him.  containment pod is soundproof, bulletproof, and most importantly, 626proof.  he took everyone's presents and ruined christmas.  why.  perhaps too many visions ..  626's original destructive programming has come back online.  open container. i will give 626 adjustments.  pleakley: stop.  as an ambassador of good will towards men, and the official christmas tree for this house, i cannot allow you to adjust 626 in such a manner.  give me the mallet.  pleakley's right.  we need to find out why he's acting the way he is.  jumba:..  this brain analyzer will let us see what destructive thoughts are in your mind.  lilo: but these aren't destructive thoughts at all.   ew.  jumba: aha. you see there.  there was logical reasoning for 626's behavior.  you were after an experiment pod the whole time.  i thought you were just after the christmas presents.  now, we need to figure out which present has the pod, then return all the other gifts.  pleakley:..  maka maka. salsa.  oh, no.  it was santa.  it was horrible.  he took the roof, and all of stitch's presents.  and he didn't even notice me.  and i'm the christmas tree.  gantu: ho ho ho.    hey, what is wrong.  why the long branches.  i'm doing my best to represent a coniferous evergreen indicative of the holiday season, but no one seems to care.  oh. maybe maybe you need festive parcels.  what.  presents for to have underneath you.  of course.  presents under the christmas tree.  i've been going about this backwards.  christmas isn't about the tree.  it's about the presents under it.  626 and little girl are stalking gantu.  they will bring presents.  no, no, no, i have to get my own.  otherwise, it doesn't really count.  ..  to the mall.  the big whale head must have all the presents inside the ship.   we'll have to figure out a way to sneak inside.  we'll have to be quiet, and notstitch.  eee aah.  hey, hey, hey. keep it down out here.  i'm taking a christmas nap.  ..   i'm ok.  i'm fluffy.  i mean it. pipe down.  ow.  ok, then.  we'll storm the place.  be on your guard.  i do not want to be trampled in holiday shopping frenzy.    look.  there he is.  pleakley: it's santa.   stitch: sabata.  aha.  santa. hey, you're not santa claus.  you're not any claus at all.  wrap him up, stitch.  i'll find the presents.  shuggiba.   hey, i was saving that nog for later.  there's no presents.  ah, look.  gantu took all the presents, all right.  took them. where.   oh, hang on. i should get that.  hello.  is 626 and little girl being there.  .. it's for you.  jumba, gantu and the presents are gone.  both are here at mall.  although at first we thought gantu was santa, but he was an impostor.  pleakley: oh, no, you don't, lady.  i saw it first.  aah. you must hurry.  shopping on christmas eve is very dangerous.  come on, stitch.  you wrapped a small parcel for me.  it's among these others.  i can't seem to find it.  to hamsterwheel, from your space buddy gantu.  have a cosmic christmas and a nebulous new year.  show off.  finally.  an unactivated pod that i can hand over tomagata.  abomination.  gantu, don't you know.  christmas is all about giving.  and you're going to give that back, or by the crest of the tanlars moon, i'll you'll what.  i am asking.  ..  in accordance with galactic standoff regulations, you, my friend, are outnumbered.  or, in the immortal words of santa claus, ho ho ho.   pleakley: hey. that's not fair.  you can't do this to a christmas tree.  hand it over.   oh.  pleakley: jumba, be careful.  you're twisting my tinsel.  jumba: your elbow is in 2 of my eyes.  stop that, you little trog.   whoa.  i'm looking for a shrunken head.  fake, of course.  shrunken head.  sorry, lady.  head shrinking is not part of hawaii's cultural heritage.  try south america.   what was that.   look. it's santa.  and his mutant elf.   hurry. take this.  hand it over.  i don't have it, you big dummy.  my patience is growing thin.  ow. hey. stop that.  ..oh...oh...  whoa. whoa. whoa.  ha. got you.  oh, blitzen.    that's the biggest santa i've ever seen.  at last.  freedom.  sweet holiday freedom.  aah.  i've lost my decorative orbs.    lilo, are you all right.  i'm fine.   i should have done this a long time ago.  go ahead.  you've already ruined christmas for everyone.  i ruined christmas.  you're the one who took the present i was planning to give to hamsterviel.  ..  were going to give hamsterviel a gift.  well, yes.  isn't that what your christmas holiday is all about, giving presents.  ..  you're right.  igulligoo.  it's not about getting presents.  it's about giving.  santa.  do i get a present.  you. a proto earth form.  don't be ridiculous.  why would ino, that's not fair.  stop looking at me like that.  cease using your ocular orbs to gain sympathy.   this is an infectious holiday you have on this planet.  perhaps this is a present we can all enjoy.  i can always find something else to send to hamsterviel.  ..experiment 025.  this is experiment i designed as a beacon to signal alien armada.  i think will make excellent gift.   ..  topper.  and i know the perfect place for you.  see.  i knew i made a great christmas tree.  ..  the blinking lights tickle.   ..  i now have the perfect tree topper.   you see.  makes wonderful decoration for christmas tree, no.  gantu: and here's one for little kikoa.  one for pakeesha.  and this one's for james.   is good.  i am liking this holiday more and more.  ohana is the best gift of all.  mele karma chameleon.  lilo: that's mele kalikimaka.  alien:hey. who turned on the signal beacon.  second alien:who cares. they got fruitcake down there.  third alien:come on, guys.   captioning made possible bydisney channel depapartment of education
