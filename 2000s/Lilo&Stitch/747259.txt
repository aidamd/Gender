 yep.  602 is designed to slice ships in half, sink entire navies, and hold breath for very long time.  number 602 is very territorial and will remain in bay until all and every ship is sinking.   but what about the boat race.  until 602 is captured, any ship in bay is like bagel.  what.  slice in half and toast.  all right, you little water trog, where are you.  get to the shore, man.  there's something sinking the boats.  see anything.  no. only a giant fin headed right for us.  .  i think i just lost my deposit.  buggy is being ready for aquatic travel, complete with high torque turbine and special bonsai stabilizers.  that's all well and good, but where's the yardarm, the sails, the poop deck.  it's a real thing.  it's the deck at the stern of the ship.  this is hightech water buggy.  no need for pooping deck.   move your blue alien butt.  nnh. naga.  what is wrong with 626.  he doesn't want to go because he sinks in water.  ahh. not to worry.  special life jacket is totally sinkproof, dunkproof and comes in 3 designer colors.  mmm, laga botoopa.  everything is so automatic, you don't even have topush any buttons.  see anything. how are they doin'.  little girl and 626 are in position, but the waves keep rocking the boat, making it difficult to get a clear view.  ..  ..  ..  i think i'm gonna heave ho.  jumba's sonar device should lead us straight to your cousin.  capture cannon ready.  unh.  oh, ooh.  wigga tama chuta.  ugh, huffer hok.  i don't know what you said, but you said it.  is impossible.  602 has sunk my superior water buggy.  forget the buggy.  lilo and the little monster are in the water with that beast.  we have to save them.  can we borrow this. thank you.  hey.  little girl and 626 will be fine until we get there.  rocking of boat is nice and relaxing, no.  i'm seeing colors that were never meant to be.  ooh.  lilo: over here, jumba.  oh, tata.  oh, no.  this is just like what happened in lilo's play.   faster.   wait. we're facing the wrong way.  aah. aah.  aka chuta.  what'll we do if it comes back.  heh heh, not to worry.  602 only sinks boats, not people.  so we'll safely drift back into shore.  .. not hawaiian shore, because ocean current is carrying us out to sea.  man:  as the bell rings    3, 2   girl:  let's go, let's go   chorus:  da, dada    dada dada    da, dada   as the bell rings   da, dada    dada dada    da, dada    as the bell rings    so, that's when i realized i needed to multiply ..cake.  .   get out of my way, geek.  what a jerk. brooke, you're not a geek.  well, i'm startin' to believe he thinks that's my name.  did you guys hear that.  um, no, we were avoidingfrank.  well, he keeps calling brooke a geek.  i think you guys should say something to him.  i'm happy to help out, but i don't speak bully.  i speak a little jock, and i'm thinkin' about taking portuguese.  this is serious.  i think it's time somebody gave frank a taste of his own medicine.  i don't know about this, guys.  calling me a geek is not that big a deal.  no, you know what, brooke. yes, it is.  someone messes with you, and they're messing with me.  ok, now, come on.  get out of my way, geek.  who are you calling a geek, frank.  or should we say francis.  what's goin' on.  why are you guys all dressed like that.  how come you're dressed likethat.  yeah, you're the only one that stands out now, francis.  francis. that's my grandmother's name.  but i don't think we ever called her frank.    listen, frank, i think you got something to say to my friend here.  oh, yeah.  yeah.  i'm sorry i called you a geek, brooke.  you see, sometimes i project my own insecurities on others.  it won't happen again.  thanks, toe jam.  and thanks, geeks.    i don't know how much more of this i can takethe sun beating down on us, no food, no water, just drifting out at sea for weeks on end.  we have only been in the water 3 minutes, 28 seconds.  that long.  this is awful.  look at side with more brightness.  we are safe.  mmm. naka botifa.  what about the boat race.  and keoni.  if we don't find sinker, nobody is safe.  eh, sinker.  even if i haven't caught him, i can still name him.   stitch: oh, tata.  waa.  an overpriced floating hotel.  we're saved.  urr urr urr ah.  hey.  we're not saved.  they didn't see us.  ..oh...hi.  aah.  oh, my goodness.  there's a sea monster outside the window.  honey, they're not windows.  they're portholes.  aah.  hey. watch it up there.  me grabbing hold.  626 is very inventive.  i still don't see why i had to come along.  my buns are gettin' soggy.  that experiment's here somewhere, and i need your help.  so captain curr, the scourge of the seas, the bad boy of boating, can't navigate these waters withouta new boat.  602 is out there and there's no way to stop it.  kinda of like when my sister's eating chocolate.  since buggy is now kaput i could construct an evil genius device from parts of ship.  look at this.  at 2:30, there's a yoga class.  oh, they have a spa. waa.  hey, hey, hey.  no time for pleasure cruise niceties.  today you are evil genius assistant.  just one game of shuffle board.  stitch and i will go tell the captain that we need to get off this boat so we can go catch 602.  ohh. cola.  stitch.  urrr. glug glug glug.   woman: harvey, be a dear and rub some lotion on my shoulders.  blech. blech.   ow. your nails are sharp.  ooh see bakita.  aah.  we gotta go find the captain and warn him his ship is in danger.  another hallway.   where's the room where the captain drives the boat.  ohh ooh.  uhehaah.   ahh.  oh.  ahh.   well, it looks like someone's been a naughtywaughty dog, haven't they.  ha ha ha ha.  busted.  i'm tiffani, the cruise director.  aren't you just the cutest little girliewhirly.  ooh, i can just eat you up.  please stop talking like that.  it's not a good idea for a cute little kiddle bunkin like you to be wandering around unsupervised.  we're on our way to see the captain.  ha ha ha ha. that is so cute.  you want to see the captain.  ha ha ha. follow me.  doll: ahoy, matey. welcome aboard.  i knew she was too perky to be trusted.   this is all that was available.  everything else is rented for that ridiculous watercraft race.  there it is.  whoa oh.  uhoh.  how much stuff does an evil genius invention require.  an electronic device, motor of some kind and souvenirs from gift shop to send to evil genius family back home.  radio: there's the windup and delivers.   it's a hit to center field.  ..going it's gone.   look out. iceberg dead ahead.  aah.  aah.  nap time's for babies.  ready for operation nightynight.  oh, goody.  it's twinklehead.  ohh.  looks like someone's being a bad little sailor.  look, lady, we really need to see the captain.  someone needs a timeytimeout in frownytown.  frownytown.  ugh.  little girl.  626.  you know these 2.  yes. no.  well, which is it.  what was question again.  man on p.a.: hello, this is your captain.  seems we picked up a few stowaways, so we're going to make a little stop in kuwaii to drop them off.  no. no, no, no, no. that's where sinker is.  he'll sink us all.  we've got to catch him before the race starts.  i just hope keoni hasn't found another boat.  jumba: i'm hoping everyone is good at holding breath, because once we are in bay, 602 will be sinking boat.  and don't forget the tricky sharks in the water.  they look like dolphins.  they try to fool ya. they're tricky.  oh, yeah, they're tricky.  even if we do get out, we don't have any way to stop 602.  this ship, keoni, the boat race, it's all gonna sink.  that is where little girl is wrong.  ha. i have secret plan hidden in lifeboat.  but first we have to break out of evil playroom.  we'll have to be quiet.   or we could go that way.  just connect hose here.  put in batteries there.  wind this up and aha.  626 is ready.  lilo: cool.  an underwater suit.  don't worry.  this time you're supposed to sink, but now you've got air to breathe.  and special blending machine will make 626 move through water very quickly, like greasy lightning.  well, butter him up, because here it comes.   ok. the coast is clear.  jumba: i am not coming out.  come on, jumba.  you look cute.  is undignified for evil genius to dress like earth child.  now, let's go find the captain.   oh. sabatta.  unh, chibu chiba.  ha ha ha.  ordu baby.  ha ha ha.  ha ha ha ha.  ha habah.  stupid monocle.  this is where captain is being.  hey. there's no one in there.  nobody there.  you mean no one's driving the boat.  we gotta do something.  ahh.  there you are.  whoaoh.  oh.  ohoh, did i do that.  sorry.  oh, drat.  you knocked the captain out of the window.  yes, but don't panic.  my galactic federation training included waterbased crafts.  i am evil genius.  i should be one driving giant aqua boat.  look sharp, 625.  i'm not gonna have that blasted experiment sink us again.   huh.  open experiment.  waah.  oh. now you've done it.  na ha. not my fault.  yours.  ooka.  ooka sabatta.  ha ha ha ha ha.  ha ha ha ha.  stitch. it can't stop.  a tatta.  urrr.  grra raa raa.  lilo: stitch.  whoo. a gabba.  abbba bbb bbb aaaa.  whoa.  here comes the crashing.  hold onto your patookies.  wait. ii think we're slowing.  announcer: welcome to the 9th annual aloha boat race.  we'll begin shortly.  captains, prepare to weigh anchor.     so much for finding another boat in time.  oh, well.  lilo: hey, keoni.  i found you another boat.  well, look at the bright side, mr. blubber.  even you can't sink this.  ..wich.  ha ha ha ha.  ha ha haooh. hey,
