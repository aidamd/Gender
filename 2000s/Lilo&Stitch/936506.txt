 aloha, lilo.  what, you going swimming.  me and stitch are cleaning up pudge's grotto.  i'll tell him you said hi.  uh, sure.  i can't believe people just leave their trash around like this.  pachaka, ikki.  stitch, you pick up around the cove while i go see pudge and clean up down there.  oketaka.  blahh.   nnn.  mmm. cheesy.    come on. we gotta go.  hey, what do we do with all this trash.  just toss it over the cliff.    stitch. look what i found down there.  stitch.   cousin.  way to clean up the pollution.  hey, that could be your name.  how 'bout i call you ploot.   let's go see what else he can do.     thanks for cleaning the sewer.  i guess all jamba's experiments weren't so evil.  way to go, ploot.  you've found your one true place all on your own.  stitch, what do you say we just let ploot go off and help clean up our island.    ..ohh...  stitch.  are you ok.  ahchoo.  uhoh.  ahchoo.  ahchoo.  and then he started sneezing, and then all this happened.  ahchoo.  hmm.  dr. jumba will have to do much diagnosing.  if you're going to be the doctor, who's going to be the nurse.  why does everybodyautomatically look at me.  doctor, i will not let your ego hurt this patient.  or this hospital.  well, that's what the nurses on tv always say.  should i administer the aromatherapy now.  what.  you're a doctor, and you've never heard of healing through the nose.   stitch, this'll smell so good, it'll make your nose smile.   ahchoo.  oh, no. stitch.  hard to believe i can't solve problem.  i'm evil genius.  you sure are a genius.  you invented ploot, and he's not even evil at all.  what is experiment you call ploot.  the one who cleans up the pollution.  cleans pollution.   hmm.  ah, you mean experiment 515.  heh heh heh. no, is not cleaning pollution.  is collecting pollution.  what's the difference.  the more pollution he collects, the larger and bigger he grows until he becomes large pollution beast.  then he creates a thick, black sludge which he will spray all over town until everything is covered in a stinky coating of its own trash.  ah ha ha ha ha ha ha.  that's pretty evil.  heh. thank you.  but 626 is most unwell.  if you wish to protect island from being smothered in its own pollution, you'll have to go alone.  male announcer: here comesthe jonas fan van.  hey, guys.  i'm nicole andersonfromjonas, and i'm a fan just like you.  right

look.  the hair is really well done. yeah.  they got the white pants and the yellow tie down.  i'm playing guitar in it, and that kind of makes me happy.  what's it like to see yourself in a video game.  it's kind of a dream come true.  you know, you always think you'll be able to play music one day, and then maybe i'll have my own video game.  so tell me what happens in this game.  well, you do a lot of different things.  there's games where you can, like, play guitar on stage and you can strum.  and in the other games, you know, you follow us around in the firehouse, in our school, you can go into the stellavator and change our outfits.  what kind of jonas performances can the fans do in the game.  one of the ones that wejust did waskeeping it real, which is one of my favoritesongs from the tv show.  requires a little bitof coordination, ..i didn't knowi didn't have.  whoa. you just scored. point. point.   and what's coming up onjonas,our show.  a coup it's really cool to

drinking.  very good.  626, stick out tongue.  blaah.  it's working.  it really, really, really worked.  it really did.  nurse pleakley, we have cured this patient of a rare space disease.  ..ah...  ..  uhoh.  wachoo.  oh, boy.  lilo: sparky, will you help me.    man: hey, you kids.  quit messing with that light.  maybe you should stay here.  woman: sorry, kid.  hatha, she called in sick today, and there's a party of 30 coming in one hour.  i really need this guy today.  it's not that i won't help you.  it's not that i can't help you.  it's a matter of you helping yourself to this beautiful kokua town historical society umbrella.  what do you say.   ok. team "b," thank you for volunteering.  finder.  babyfier.   drowsy.   ok, we might not be the roughest or the toughest or even anywhere close to that.  but we're gonna get ploot.    meep.  finder, i think you found him.    he's too powerful.  retreat.  lilo: ow. ow.  ow, ow, ow.  sludge sample from hair may prove useful for evilgenuis testing.  we didn't get ploot.  now everything's going to get polluted.  well, you tried. you failed.  yes, 515 will soon cover city in its own pollution.  but earth people do this every day, so why to bother.  because if everyone just gave up, nothing good would ever get done.   doctor.  we just got the analysis of stitch's stomach contents.  eww.  i don't believe it.  my diagnosis of 626 was incorrect.  now i know what for certain makes him so sick.  fascinating.   computer: aluminum can.  plastic bottle.  broken pen.  stitch ate all that trash.  i guess he just wanted to know what it tasted like.  626 got funky in stomach because he was polluted.  we have to go stop ploot.  but 626 needs doctor and nurse here.  then just i'll go.  even though i've never caught an experiment by myself before, i'll never know if i can make a difference if i don't try, right.  little girl is right.  i will be one person making difference, too.  come on.  how is my standing here helping to fight the giant pollution monster again.  waiting one moment, please.  it looks like ordinary flying saucer toy, hmm.  jumba, it's no time for a friendly game of catch.  don't worry. is not friendly.  watch.  oh. i got it.  i got it.  it's got me.  it's got me.  i'm going to need more than a net to catch ploot.  eh, normally i do not like little girl to have blasting device.  nani says no blasters till i'm older.  but this one only shoots rubber bands.  don't you aim that thing at me.  no, no.  never.  heatseeking projectile will find him anyway.  hah.  you missed me.  whoooohooh.   here is one more.  a rain slicker.  it could get icky out there.  hey, i see smog at the south end of the island.  we'll stay here and make 626 better as fast as scientifically possible.   eh, get out of here, kid.  ploot, you've gotta stop this right now.  you're wrecking everything.  ok. you asked for it.   aha.  i've got you.   aah.     ..  get steaming.  where is it.  pleakley.  use the thing.   paging nurse pleakley.  yes, doctor.   where is dish with sample of sludge.  that sticky thing.  i work so hard to create a crisp, clean hospitallike freshness, and you foul it up with your dish of pure pollution.  here you go.  i sprayed it with cookiesandcream air freshener.  you sprayed with this.  well, i couldn't decide which scent was best, so i also sprayed it with this.  toasted flower garden.  is making sludge shrink down.  chemical reaction between 2 terriblesmelling sprays is causing shrinkage of noxious compounds in sludge.  quickly, we must take to little girl.  626, keep steaming.  eep.  this place was so stinky, i used up all the spray.  then we have to get more.   you could clean this all up if you wanted to.  i've seen you do it.   pleakley: we'll just run in, get what we need, and run out.  hmm. buy 5, get 3 free.  that's a good deal.  but do we even need garbage bags.  let's see. one in the kitchen.  one in theyaah.  huh.  ohh.  lifeguard: hey, that stuff's
