 i hope so.  business hasn't been as good since everyone started counting calories.  hope you haven't forgotten about my slumber party tonight.  oh, yeah. your slumber party.  don't worry. we haven't forgotten.   see you later.  but we're not going to her slumber party.  i never said we were going.  i just said we didn't forget.  is everything ready.  they should be here soon.  pillows are plumped and ready.   even though i'm the adult guardian, i'm as excited as a little girl.  it's getting late.  where is everybody.  welcome.  oh. hi.  come on in.  stitch, your guests are here.  windebah.  weesa.  .  who invited them.  i didn't authorize this.   where are my friends.  then when i was 12 i was often excluded from my peer group's parties.  let me stop you there.  i understand your problem.  you do.  it's obvious.  your life is a boring failure.  i wouldn't want to be you either.  all you do is whine.  " you said you wanted to hear it.  i didn't think it would be so tedious.  daddy always said to trust no one.  .  don't you feel better now.  hmm, boring failure. says him.  what does he know anyway.  excuse me.  uh, could you tell us where orchid street is.  wwe seem to be a little lost.  no, i don't know where orchid street is.  oh, that's all right.  i know what you're thinking.  i don't know where orchid street is because i'm a boring failure, that's what.  uh, that's not what i was thinking at all.  come on, ginger.  oh, yeah. run away from the boring failure.  run far awaywith ginger.  run far away. daddy always said they would.  this is all that trog's fault.  wait. it can't be.  experiment pods, 4 of them.  i could activate them and turn them into my own army.  then i'll finally be able to destroy that trog.   we're done with the pillow fight phase and have moved on to the facial phase.  come on, people.  stick to the schedule.   no. get off.  oh. aah.  no.  hao.   i can't believe nobody came.  well, except your cousins.  don't get me wrong, stitch.  i love having you for a friend, but sometimes i want a whole mess of friends.  is that so wrong.  hmm. yao.  this is exactly why i didn't want monsters at this party.  you over there, get your tail out of that socket.  ok, little monster, you can see in the dark, so go fix the fuse box.  i'm going to look for an earthstyle light stick.  figures everything's going wrong.  i just wanted to have a simple party for me and a group of my closest friends.  ..i don't have a group of close friends.  i wish i could make a whole bunch of friends.  make friends.  all right, lilo. stitch fixed the fuse.   hmm.  ok, just make me a bunch of friends exactly like me.   this isn't gonna hurt, right.  lilo.  wah. blblblblblbl.   uhoh.  what is all this racket.  i am trying touhoh.  stitches: nee ha hao.  welcome, heat, thresher, plasmoid, and hammerface.  i'm going to train you into the leanest, meanest unit in the galaxy and send you on a very important mission.  this is your target.  very funny. t.p. the pleakley.  party's over. time to go.   pleakley.  lilo, thank goodness you're here.  aah.  .. an incident.  nee ha hao.  you sit here, stitch.  i'll introduce youryour, um, cousins to the house.  no. no more cousins.  i just got rid of the last ones.  whoa. aah.     glacka, glacka.  down.  down.  off. off.  can we send them back to where they came from.  is possible.  replicating experiment has reverse function.  i don't want to send 'em back.  they're my posse.  they just need a little bit of work.  aah.  yecch. blecch.  pardon me for pointing out the obvious, but they're going to need a lot of work.  we'll start their training immediately.  ahh.   ha ha. blah.   wah.  yeow.  bad.  i really think we should send them back.  i trained stitch.  i can train them, too.  me ganala.  you're not as strong as stitch, and that's good, 'cause it means you won't cause as much trouble.  you'll be the perfect group of friends.  ready for a little target practice, men.   commence attack.  ..  melt.  aah.  cut it out.  heat, would you do the honors.  that's not funny.  thresher, you could use some exercise.  jump in at any moment.  hey. aah.  i'm serious.  it's good to see that you've finally become useful, 625.  so, anyway, i demanded they give me a refund.  hey, guys.  i missed you at my slumber party.  we had a scheduling conflict.  that's ok.  let me introduce you to my new friends.  there goes hula class.  by the way, i'm having another slumber party ..  with a levitation.  oh, really.  yup. only this time you're not invited.  right, guys.  yeah. yeah. yeah.  it's good to have a posse.  we got popcorn for the slumber party tonight.   stitch.  what's wrong with you.  is side effect of replication.  strength of 626 has been divided into 4.  what do we do about it.  can reverse replication.  stitch all 626s back into one 626.  ..  i'm finally gonna have my party tonight with my posse.  i know exactly what stitch needs to feel better.  a good levitation.  uff.  you just take it easy, stitch.  well, men, you've worked hard.  and now you're ready.  let's do this.  lilo: ok, everybody, concentrate.  not too high, please. i get dizzy.  all: light as a feather, stiff as a board.  light as a feather, stiff as a board.  i think he's levit stitch.  ondekata.  take the trog, men.  take all the trogs.  your evil experiments can't beat 4 stitches.  yeah.  yah.  huh.  yeow.  3 down, 1 to go.  oh, no. they're too weak.  aah.  blah. missed me.  bao.  ha ha. just as we practiced.  lilo.  stitch.  good work, men.  this is only the beginning.  now that the trog, er, trogs have been defeated, we will capture every experiment on this planet.  ahem. i rang the bell.  625: you can forget it.  i'm not coming out.  fine. plasmoid.  all right. all right.  happy now.  i want you to make a victory feast for my brave warriors.  a victory feast.   with or without crusts.  this is all my fault.  i made stitch weak by splitting him up just so i could have a posse.  oh. now what do we do.  only thing we can do is unite the 4 separate 626s back into one and let him defeat gantu.  if we're gonna sneak on gantu's ship, we're gonna need a distraction, but that's usually stitch's job.  we're gonna need a new decoy.  all right, i called an emergency carpenter to come and fix the damage.  maybe nani won't ever notice.  why are you looking at me that way.  as official adult guardian, i'd like to go on record as saying i think we should forget about the little monsters.  sure you'll miss 'em for a while, but you'll get overaah.  oh.  we're all wearing the same outfit.  we can't all wear the same thing.  it's vulgar.  can i get a pair of pants.  these are horrible.  sorry. we were out of mayo.  i used yogurt.   whoops. gotta get that.  pleakley: delivery for captain gantu.  for me. let them in.  congratulations, captain gantu, from an admirer.  another one.  i wonder who sent them.  a little bouquet for a gantu.  this is too much.  obviously, someone appreciates superior leadership.   come on.  which one of you is stitch.  come on, guys.  which one of you sent these.  i know you.  i know all of you.  you're all pleakley.  we're being invaded, men.  oh, no. we better hurry.  well, what have we here.   another one for my army.  don't you dare touch him.  he doesn't want to make copies of all your evil experiments.  making copies of my army.  that's an inspired idea.  i'll make 100 of each of them.  nothing but hamsterviel will be powerful enough to stop me.  make me 100 plasmoids.  no.  ..  100 threshers.  oh. what horrors have you wrought.   and 100 hammerfaces.  no.  out of my way, softie.  come on, stitch.  we gotta pull yourself together.  look at me.  i'm an action hero.  is it you.  the one and only.  aha.  strike.  i don't understand.  my armythey're so weak.  you tricked me.  yup. it's a side effect.  united you stand, but divided, you're a whole mess of weaklings.  huh.  onh chika.  aah.  ha ha ha.  we came. we saw.  we kicked their sissy butts.   hey, there, chief.  wanna talk.  when i was 13, i had braces.  that's it. let it all out.  i'm the adult guardian.  stitch, i'm sorry i split you up and made you all weak just so i could have friends.  but at least i learned a lesson.  huh.  when it comes to friends, it's quality, not quantity that counts.  oh.  we do have to figure out where dupe belongs.  what a minute.  i have an idea.  i'll have one of your halfcalorie lemon ices, please.  one halfcalorie shaved ice coming right up.  captioning made possle byabc cable networks group captioning performed bythe national captioning institute, inc.  tookie bah waba.  hao.  iki bah bah.  ha ha ha.   i laila 'o kaua'i la
