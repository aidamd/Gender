surfers, we're going behind the scenes of the latest disney movie.  movie surfers.  the latest animated feature from disney, the princess and the frog, puts a modern twist on a classic tale.  tiana is a regular girl leading a normal life.  i don't have time for dancing.   i'm making my own fairy tale.  until one day, the magic of new orleans takes over,  and life for tiana is never the same again.  ahhhhh.  i'm green, and i'm slimy.  look you are secreting mucus.  you. you.  and i caught up with anika noni rose at the studio to talk  about what it's like being green.  so, can you set up the story of princess and the frog.  my character, princess tiana, meets a frog who clams he is a prince.  i am prince naveen.   i'm not done yet.  there sort of at odds in the beginning.  tiana is the type of person who is going to work for what she wants and naveen, he is the type of person who has had everything giving to him his hole life which leads him to being webby.  oh oh.    i am a price charming and handsome.  cutting a rug, and the next thing i know i'm tripping over these.  they go on this grand adventure.  comon' child.   can you tell us about some of the challenges that they face.   there are a lot of challenges in a swamp  where you're running into alligators and frog hunters.  oh, i got me one boys.    so, it's about not only finding away to go back  to being human, but finding a way to get back to new orleans and make things right.  let me shine a little light on the situation.  excuse me.  so tiana is not a very big fan of frogs, but how do you feel about them.  i actually love frogs.   i'm really excited about doing something where i get to touch a frog.  would you ever kiss a frog.  and that's where it ends.   i will not be kissing a frog.   come we pucker.   that's new.   you can catch more of tiana and her magical friends  when disney's princess and the frog,  jumps, hops, and skips into theaters soon.  bye surfers, see ya there.  nanatu.   yuh.

or locating frankenstein's brain   it's over here.   finding a dodo bird, painting a continent    or driving our sister insane   phineas.   as you can see    there's a whole lot of stuff to do    before school starts this fall   come on, perry.   so stick with us 'cause phineas and ferb    are gonna do it all    so stick with us 'cause phineas and ferb    are gonna do it all   mom.  phineas

 all you have to do is park between this plastic trash can and that plastic trash can.  candace:..  aah. aah. aah.  aah. aah. aah.  aah. aah. aah.   then dad said my parallel parking "needs " he means i'll never get my driver's license.  i'm such a loser.  oh, my gosh, ferb,i can't believe it.  i've never noticedhow soft our carpets are.  but more importantly, we have to help candace get her
