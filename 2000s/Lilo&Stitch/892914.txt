 you did earn your keep pretty good today.  gabba ghi.  stitch, we say please around here, remember.  stitch special.  yeah, you're special, but don't be bossy.  if you keep it up, you'll end up like that guy in that movie who bossed people around and then zombies ate him.  he deserved it.  the little monster could stand to learn some manners.  as long as he asks for something rudely, we won't give it to him.  stitch.  unless he hits me with potatoes.  migga nagga cheetah koota.  626 says mashed potatoes no longer good enough for him.  stitch special.  tch, tch, tch, perhaps 626 is getting too big for fuzzy blue britches.  that is all.  i will show you to disrespect evil genius scientist creator.  jumba, you in here.  i brought your dinner.  mashed potatoes, and some of it hasn't even been in my nose.  i'm sure stitch didn't mean what he said.  you should get madaah.  no, no, no. you don't see what you see.  giant eye play tricks.  ..  ..  new experiment pod, yes, i admit it, but is greatest invention yet.  greater than stitch.  sure. 626 thinks he is cream of crop.  i have proven other way.  i have done him one better, literally.  allow me to be introducing experiment 627.  grr.  has all strengths of 626, none of weaknesses.  does not sink in water, available in tasteful earth tone colors, and absolutely, positively cannot be turned to good.  why would you make such an awful, snarling, clawing, growling little monster .. grr.  ah, 626 needed a reality check.  besides, had plans laying around.  you know evil genius, use it or lose it.  this is completely against galactic regulations.  in all good sense, i'm going toi have other old plans, like maybe for experiment with giant finger for poking someone's giant eye.  well, maybe the others don't need to know just yet.  ..  don't worry.  627 is nice and safe in container.  no evil to worry about.  i'm getting horrible feeling i've forgotten something very important.  ha ha ha ha ha ha.  evil, evil.  ooh, yes.  just remembered, 627 has super skills of escaping.  oh, no. this isn't good.  it's the opposite of good.  it's a disaster.  dr. hamsterviel: you have achieved a new record for failure, my spongebrained puddy.  i am becoming reluctant to show my face around the galactic overlord's cell block.  associating with this lahooser is not doing wonders for my rep, either.  perhaps if i wasn't forced to babysit a half wit, i could get something done on this orbiting mudball.  dr. hamsterviel: silence.  i should be smacking you both firmly about the head, not even caring if i accidentally poke you in the nose.  call me when you manage to do something right.  you know, chowder chops, i'm not so sure our current arrangement is working out.  maybe you oughta find yourself another sidekick.  what is that.  aah. drool out. gross.  evil. evil.  great. disgusting and evil.   evil.  evil. evil. evil.   ..  so just as i was talking about what a doorknob you are, this experiment fell into my lap.  sure was easy to catch him.  anyway, i just thought it'd be a good sidekick for you to chase experiments with, then both you knuckleheads can get creamed by the little girl and 626.  grr.  meanwhile, i can stay home and do what i do best.  nothing.  you've got something i need: power.  this could be the start of a beautiful relationship.  lilo: experiment 603, a living laser bolt.  barnyard animals and laser beams don't go together.  all right, you're wanted on the set.  stitch, i think you should know you're starting to act really stuck up, like you're better than everybody, and for your information, really cool people don't act like that.  uhuh. stitch special.  meega booto.  oops.  nice work, show off.  gantu.  what are you doing here.  no offense, but i've seen more than enough of your undies.  i thought i'd introduce you to my new assistant.  ..  that is one gnarlylooking cousin, stitch.  ha ha ha. meega jabba.  graah. raah.   lucky shot.  meega doota.  ouch.  this, at last, is power.  it looks good on me.  lilo: it was incredible, like nothing we've seen.  it was even tougher than stitch.  akka tabba.  so 626 thinks severe pounding was onetime only fluke, eh.  well, i don't, and whichever experiment it is, we gotta figure out how to beat it.  i see you're searching jumba's database of old experiments.  i wonder if he has a file of more recent experiments made as recently as, say, yesterday.  you mean like experiment made to pop people in eyeball.  huh.  uh, if creature you're looking for is as amazing as you say, should be studied for science, ..  is oneeyed big mouth trying to tell you something.  something about you having a screw loose.  ah, my silly friend, he is one with screw loose if he think's i would let him tell you that i built 627.   oh, i am very busted now.  . you made a 627..  who's afraid of the finger now, big boy.  .  but now, you see brilliant scientific achievement.  you know that 627 is even better than 626.  stitch special.  yes, 626, you are smart, funny, cute, and as we know, fluffy, but 627 has powers of 20 different experiments.  rrarr. mega chooby. jiba 627.  you would prove you're better prove it.  stitch, are you sure.  ehh. dabba ehh.  waah.   ha ha ha.  ohh.  oh. hee hee. ow. oh.  aah.  aggabee oogabee eggabee oh.  aah.  blaah.  eeh.  wuhh.  ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.  evil.  ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.  perhaps i made booboo when i constructed 627.  oh, well. living and learning, eh.  heh heh heh heh.  stitch, i've got a new plan for how to beat up 6.  stitch not special.  yes, you are.  so you're not king of the block anymore.  you're still king of my block.  ..bluhh.  we'll think of something to beat that thing of gantu's.  i know we will.  maybe an army of vampires.   muhh.  ha ha ha ha. ha ha ha ha.  oh, i'm so glad you joined us.  .  you're wearing a cape.  ah, that's not any cape.  that's his take over the galaxy cape with matching boots and wrist thingies.  fancy capes mean nothing.  you're still only my fishy flunky.  not any more, dr. hamsterviel.  i am now the supreme order bringer of the universe.  more like of the unitard. ha ha ha ha.   aah.  in case it isn't clear, i quit.  waah.  ha ha ha ha.  ha ha ha ha.  ha ha ha ha.  ha ha ha ha.  ha ha ha ha.  ha ha ha ha.  ha ha ha ha.  ha ha ha ha.  enough. it wasn't that funny.  but it was very interesting.  we will return to when winger does attack after this.  when are you two gonna cheer up.  me. when i figure out how to beat 627.  stitch, when existence ceases to be meaningless.  remember the battle cry of grooveplok 5" what happened on grooveplok 5.  they gave up.  hey, jumba, you're an evil genius.  can't you just unmake 627.  little girl must be joking.  hydration process is extremely complicated and technical.  no method known for going backward.  once experiment is hydrated, absotively, posilutely impossible to be dehydrated.  tv announcer: do you need something dehydrated.  well, now, it's possible.  we present the instant dehydrator.  dries out fruits, vegetableseven people you don't like.  worth a shot.  hello. customer service.  hook me up.   excuse me. i have another call.   hello.  .. exsidekick guy.  sandwich boy, why are you calling.  because i can help you beat experiment 627.  it's a trick, right.  why would you want to go against gantu.  trust meow. i haveow. my reasons.  that really hurts.  uhhuh.  really.  ok. you've got a deal.  jumba, any chance 627 could have a little problem with laughter.  ..  i gave him extra everything..  so it's possible he has extra sense of humor.  could be getting bad case of the giggles.  stitch, i think i know how to make your day.  ehh, dooba kee.  ok, so you got too full of yourself.  a big, fat head, right.  big.  so, learn from your mistake.  put on your humble shoes and do what you do.  you're still the baddest, bestest, most specialist evil genius creation i've ever known.  yeah. eeka pachooka.  who's the jive supreme order bringer of the universe.  day two.  blah. pbbbt.  my crown.  how did the abomination breach our security.  oops. musta been me. ah, just missed him.  today we take care of that little blue nuisance once and for all.  don't worry, stitch. they'll come.  evil, evil, evil.  what is that.  i am now the supreme order bringer of the universe.  well, at least you're wearing pants.  yoohoo.  toja mega patootie.  evil.  eeh. uhh. ow. eh. yow.   blehh.  rrarr. whoa.  ow. uhh.  blehh.  ha ha ha ha ha.  hey, watch it. stay focused.  ..  ha ha ha ha ha.  ha ha ha ha ha.  that's enough. stop laughing.  grrr.  oh. ow.  ha ha ha ha ha.  stop it. stop it.  as supreme order bringer, i order it.  ..  which means he'll never win another battle again.  no. noooooooooooooo.  ha ha ha ha ha.  you slayed him, stitch.  ha ha ha ha ha.  just put any item in the instant dehydrator, and presto.  pleakley: this thanksgiving dinner will be fascinating.  the sweet little monster said we waited on him hand and foot so now it's our turn.  tada.  i'm very proud of you, stitch, for learning to be so cool and humble.  ohh.  and i hope jumba has learned his lesson about making those silly evil genius experiments.  we ought to make him do the dishes.  yeah.  hey, where is jumba.  ..  ..  next time.  captioning made possible bydisney channel department of education captioning performed bythe

practice, i don't have a chance.  first prize is a new outrigger.  i'll signal you when i'm past the break.  and if i help him win, i bet there'll be a free boat ride included for me.  i'm gonna go feed pudge.  i'll be right back.  grrr.  ahh.  grrr.  unh.  stitch, there's something in the water.  aka taka.  keoni's out there.  keoni.  what is yeow.  whatwhat was that thing.  i don't know, but i think you're gonna need another boat.  john bob jones smith and i'm a normal earth tourist and i would like to rent a boat.  you're not fooling anyone, gantu.  told ya, flounder face.  blubber's still blubber, no matter how you dress it up.  ice cream sandwich.  quiet, you.  i require the use of a watercraft now.  you wanna rent stuff, i'll rent you stuff.  wow. captain clam, what happened.  the bait shop explode.  she said i needed all this.  now let's go.  we've got an experiment to catch.   i think i crushed my dinghy.   lilo: and then right after i yelled, "keoni," he jumped out of the boat.  then the big fin came out of the water.   cue fin.  grrr.  my chinese bamboo folding fan.  quiet. interrupting little genius climax.  grrr.  and that is the end of what happened. )
