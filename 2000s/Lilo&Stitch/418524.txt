 i don't know how much more of this i can takethe sun beating down on us, no food, no water, just drifting out at sea for weeks on end.  we have only been in the water 3 minutes, 28 seconds.  that long.  this is awful.  look at side with more brightness.  we are safe.  mmm. naka botifa.  what about the boat race.  and keoni.  if we don't find sinker, nobody is safe.  eh, sinker.  even if i haven't caught him, i can still name him.   stitch: oh, tata.  waa.  an overpriced floating hotel.  we're saved.  urr urr urr ah.  hey.  we're not saved.  they didn't see us.  ..oh...hi.  aah.  oh, my goodness.  there's a sea monster outside the window.  honey, they're not windows.  they're portholes.  aah.  hey. watch it up there.  me grabbing hold.  626 is very inventive.  i still don't see why i had to come along.  my buns are gettin' that experiment's here somewhere, and i need your help.  so captain curr, the scourge of the seas, the bad boy of boating, can't navigate these waters withouta new boat.  602 is out there and there's no way to stop it.  kinda of like when my sister's eating chocolate.  since buggy is now kaput i could construct an evil genius device from parts of ship.  look at this.  at 2:30, there's a yoga class.  oh, they have a spa. waa.  hey, hey, hey.  no time for pleasure cruise niceties.  today you are evil genius assistant.  just one game of shuffle board.  stitch and i will go tell the captain that we need to get off this boat so we can go catch 602.  ohh. cola.  stitch.  urrr. glug glug glug.   woman: harvey, be a dear and rub some lotion on my shoulders.  blech. blech.   ow. your nails are sharp.  ooh see bakita.  aah.  we gotta go find the captain and warn him his ship is in danger.  another hallway.   where's the room where the captain drives the boat.  ohh ooh.  uhehaah.   ahh.  oh.  ahh.   well, it looks like someone's been a naughtywaughty dog, haven't they.  ha ha ha ha.  busted.  i'm tiffani, the cruise director.  aren't you just the cutest little girliewhirly.  ooh, i can just eat you up.  please stop talking like that.  it's not a good idea for a cute little kiddle bunkin like you to be wandering around unsupervised.  we're on our way to see the captain.  ha ha ha ha. that is so cute.  you o see the captain.  ha ha ha. follow me.  doll: ahoy, matey. welcome aboard.  i knew she was too perky to be trusted.   this is all that was available.  everything else is rented for that ridiculous watercraft race.  there it is.  whoa oh.  uhoh.  how much stuff does an evil genius invention require.  an electronic device, motor of some kind and souvenirs from gift shop to send to evil genius family back home.  radio: there's the windup and delivers.   it's a hit to center field.  ..goinggone.   look out. iceberg dead ahead.  aah.  aah.  nap time's for babies.  ready for operation nightynight.  oh, goody.  it's twinklehead.  ohh.  looks like someone's being a bad little sailor.  look, lady, we really need to see the captain.  someone needs a timeytimeout in frownytown.  frownytown.  ugh.  little girl.  626.  you know these 2.  yes. no.  well, which is it.  what was question again.  man on p.a.: hello, this is your captain.  seems we picked up a few stowaways, so we're going to make a little stop in kuwaii to drop them off.  no. no, no, no, no. that's where sinker is.  he'll sink us all.  we've got to catch him before the race starts.  i just hope keoni hasn't found another boat.  jumba: i'm hoping everyone is good at holding breath, because once we are in bay, 602 will be sinking boat.  and don't forget the tricky sharks in the water.  they look like dolphins.  they're oh, yeah, they're tricky.  even if we do get out, we don't have any way to stop 602.  this ship, keoni, the boat race, it's all gonna sink.  that is where little girl is wrong.  i have secret plan hidden in li but first we have to break out of evil playroom.  we'll have to be quiet.   or we could go that way.  just connect hose here.  626 is ready.  lilo: cool.  an underwater suit.  don't worry.  this time you're supposed to sink, but now you've got air to breathe.  will make 626 move through water very quickly, like greasy lightning.  well, butter him up, because here it comes.   ok. the coast is clear.  jumba: i am not coming out.  come on, jumba.  you look cute.  is undignified for evil genius to dress like earth child.  now, let's go find the captain.   oh. sabatta.  unh, chibu chiba.  ha ha ha.  ordu baby.  ha ha ha.  ha ha ha ha.  ha habah.  stupid monocle.  this is where captain is being.  hey. there's no one in there.  nobody there.  you mean no one's driving the boat.  we gotta do something.  ahh.  u are.  whoaoh.  oh.  ohoh, did i do that.  sorry.  oh, drat.  you knocked the captain out of the window.  yes, but don't panic.  my galactic federation training included waterbased crafts.  i am evil genius.  i should be one driving giant aqua boat.  look sharp, 625.  i'm not gonna have that blasted experiment sink us again.   huh.  open experiment.  waah.  oh. now you've done it.  na ha. not my fault.  yours.  ooka.  ooka sabatta.  ha ha ha ha ha.  ha ha ha ha.  stitch. it can't stop.  a tatta.  urrr.  grra raa raa.  lilo: stitch.  whoo. a gabba.  abbba bbb bbb aaaa.  whoa.  here comes the crashing.  hold onto your patookies.  wait. ii think we're slowing.  announcer: welcome to the 9th annual aloha boat race.  we'll begin shortly.  ptains, prepare to weigh anchor.     so much for finding another boat in time.  oh, well.  lilo: hey, keoni.  i found you another boat.  well, look at the bright side, mr. blubber.  even you can't sink this.  ..wich.  ha ha ha ha.  ha ha haooh. hey, waitaah.  ptoo.  ooh. grrr.  lilo: now sinker can slice things up as much as he wants.  and who
