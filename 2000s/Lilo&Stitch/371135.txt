boss.  heh.  so, what was that crush thing your uncle jared was talking about.  i wouldn't listen to uncle jared.  he's got rat feet syndrome.  that's a disease where you make stuff up that isn't true.  what else does jumba keep in his spaceship.  well, don't tell anyone, but he has a whole secret closet full of chocolate macadamias.  this, after pleakley put him on a diet.  enough, useless,

kenny.  ohh.  hmm, seems i've had a misconception about your family, nani.   really.  yes, but now i understand.  ..  so by "aliens" he meant you were from another country.  ah ha ha.  whew. whew. whew.  ha ha. now i see it.  your uncles and your aunt do have that ohsodistinctive canadian look.  why, yes.  ..  canadia.  nani, i must say you have quite a colorful family.  now i see where you get your aloha hospitality.  what, nobody invited me to brunch.  what kind of hospitality is that.  hey, wacky uncle jared's back.  oh, no.  glad you're all sitting down 'cause have i got some stories for you.   what are you doing here.  well, you see, 626 gave me to gantu, who sent me to hamsterviel, who sent me back to gantu, who gave me to 625, who sent me back to you.  looks like i'm here to stay.   you've got to get him out of here.  please, jared, join us for dessert.  don't mind if i do.  ..  allergic.  aah. get off of me, you freak.   what's kenny got against uncle jared.  long story.   oh,

this weird a home.  ..  i'll tell you who.  someone who exhibits the very spirit of aloha hospitality.  really.  i would be proud to have you on the team, nani.  oh, thank you.  you won't regret it. i promise.  i have no doubt about that.  oh, i hope you play softball.  we're part of an interhotel league.  so, and pleakley's not a girl, huh.  nope.  good thing i only had a crush on your aunt for that one week.  really.  yeah. you know how we kids are.  we get crushes and they're over instantly.  like your crush on me.  i'll bet it's already over, right.  me. ohh, yeah.  that crush was over by
