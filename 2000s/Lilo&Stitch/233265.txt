 ..  antisepticize against all unhealthy germs and sources of filth.  so he's hung up on dirt, just like nani and pleakley.  i heard that.  you're talking about me.  aaaah.  mele kalikimaka.  another monster in the house.  no, no, no, no, no.  i forbid it.  but felix is just like you.  you two would probably get along great.  are you kidding.  it's nothing but a walking sack of jumba's evil geniusness.  it's dangerous.  jumba. he's not dangerous.  is he.  if i am remembering correctly, 010 could not tell difference between dirt for cleaning up and unbathed evil genius for leaving alone.  but i'm quite certain i fixed that loooong ago.  yes, now little 010 is so gentle, would not hurt even tiniest earth fly.   grr.  dirty.  ugh. 625.  wilted lettuce. lunch meat wrappers.  don't you ever put awaynot my fault, fish wit.  you had a perfectly good mutant cleaner in your hand, but you kicked it out.  it was driving me bananas.  but i'm beginning to think i kicked out the wrong experiment.  hey, you and me both. what a stench.  sweet sulphur gas, how i wish i'd get kicked out of here.  grr.  i'm surprised you're here, lilo.  i thought you and your dog had a full schedule of basket sitting.  we finished early.  well, i think we have the outside under control.  ..  sounds good to us.  stitch: yeah. bark. bark.  the weird factor is here to mess up all our hard work.  right.  we already have one neat freak too many in our house.  so that's definitely not the one place you belong.  but maybe you could be the janitor here.  ah.  feels good to give back to the community, huh.  ehh.  nice job, felix.  hmm.   dirty.   no. bad neat freak.  uhh.  that's not trash. it's priceless.  you can't eat it.  lilo: uhh. uhh. uhh.  aah.  aaah.  oh, no.  eech.  lilo.  oh, lilo.  i'm sorry.  i guess i got a little carried away.  you know, with the cleaning.  this was over 100 years old, lilo, made by queen lili'uokalani herself.  i'm really sorry.  i think maybe you've helped out enough for today.  what are we gonna do with you.    what's wrong.  my new king sweeper 3000that's what's wrong.  it's supposed to be the ultimate cleaning machine, but look.  click, click, click.  nothing.  it doesn't work at all.  oh, online shopping, .  never mind. felix already cleaned up.   wow.  heh heh heh.  ha ha ha.  he's good.  ..  glug. glug. glug.  pleakley:..  ..  this little guy's even more obsessively, compulsively, annoyingly neat than i am.  i have found my soul mate.  he's staying with us.   laundry pressed and starched.  linoleum buffed to a blinding polish.   it doesn't get any better.  lilo: pleakley, your "soul mate" just threw out my collection of sea shells that look like presidents.  salty sea junk. who cares.  and it chucked out stitch's bed.  wormeaten pineapple crate. so what.  i have been working on cure for pesky earth viruses.  has anyone seen my petri dish cultures.  cure for the common cold.  better off without it.  dirty.  trashy old sewing machine, who needs it.  just a heap of scrap metalwait.  that's not trash, it's retro.  it's retroooooo.    ohh.  no. no. no. no. no. no. no.  it had an original 1930s bobbin.  i never thought i'd say this, but there's such a thing as too clean.  whoa.  felix outpleakleyed pleakley.   ohh. hey, now.  open up that door.  don't make me count to 3.  ..  ..  uhoh.   i'm just rememering, i did not fix flaw in 010's programming.  great.  now you remember.  so what was the flaw.  logic problem in 010's third function.  antisepticize against all unhealthy germs and sources of filth, which is what he sees us asfilthy, huge germs to antisepticize.  that's something like taking a bath, right.  yes, like taking a bath.  the last bath you'll ever take.   huh.  dirty. dirty. dirty.  hey, everyone,with

and now is the time for the reprogramming i should have done years ago.   i don't know, maybe reprogramming the little fella is a bit too much.  after all, cleanliness is next to pleakleyness.  hey, even you said felix was too clean.  yeah, but he did disinfect all the silverware.  that's good.  and he nearly sanitized us to kingdom come.  that's bad.  you're so picky.  well, did it work.  all i can say is, it better have.  that was my last pair of rubber gloves.  ahem.  presenting 010.2, the upgrade.  reversed polarity, so is no longer obsessively neat.  well, let's try him out.  pleakley:..  what price science.  jumba: yes, see.  no reaction at all to big messmaking.  heh heh heh.  ohh.   lilo: hey, what's he doing.  i'm evil genius, not fortune teller.   now felix is an oscar.  a total dirt freak.  dirty. dirty. dirty.  interesting.  perhaps i reversed polarities tiniest bit too much.  gee, you think.   hello.  hey, kiddo.  nani.  how's honolulu.  i should have gone to the werewolf recruiters instead.  executive careers sound so boring.  i'm coming home early.  how early.  i'm at the airport right now.  i should be home in about 20 minutes.   oh, make that 15 minutes. there's my ride.  lilo. ohh.  come on. come on. come on.  we've gotta get this place cleaned up.  can you make felix into a neat freak again.  yes.  but would need 16 minutes.  go get your king sweeper 3000.  we've got no time.  oh, i thought you liked things messy.  not this messy.  it's like too much of a good thing.  well, it's too late to start appreciating my tidiness now.  you want clean, clean it yourself.  ohh.   nani: lilo, i'm home.   hey, the place doesn't look too bad.  there's a layer of grime on everything, but i guess i can't expect you to be too clean.  besides, it gives the house that nice livedin feel.  oh, it's good to be home.  yep, i think they learned a little lesson about the importance of being clean.  but just clean enough, not obsessively, dangerously, scary clean, like some people.  what are you, an afterschool special.  speaking of clean, what are we gonna do with felix, who isn't so clean anymore.  hmm. i gabba patoota.  there.  finally got the place clean.  625: uhuhuh. you missed a spot.  the entire kitchen.   ..  experiment 010. you're back.  we never should have let you go.  gantu: 625, look, it'shey, what's he doing.  625: i don't know, but i don't like it.  gantu: aaaah.  captioning made possible byabc cable networks group captioning performed bythe national captioning institute, inc.  tookie bah waba.  hao.  iki bah bah.  ha ha ha.   i laila
