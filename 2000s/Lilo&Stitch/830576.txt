fault.  she won't eat that food you made, and frankly, i don't blame her.  ..  pizzazz.  but it doesn't lack nutrition.   what's that noise.  ..  potato chips.  ..  you're eating potato chips while we're starving ourselves in protest.  ok, that does it.  this family is getting healthy.  from now on, no more junk.  pleakley, where's your stash.  stash.  i'm sure i don't know what you're talking about.  pleakley: see. nothing under the sofa cushions.  nothing under the stairs, either.  i'm telling you, there is no stash.   oh. huh.    aha.  candy bar.  coincidence.   proves nothing.    there was a stash.  eww.  stitch: stash.  i'm gonna take all this stuff to the trash.  when i get back from work tonight, i expect a nutritious meal for dinner.  no more junk. got it.  this is getting
