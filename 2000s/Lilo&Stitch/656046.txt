everything.  now, explain to me slowly and clearly, exactly what happened.  ..  keoni jameson was holding a bouquet of flowers, when he asked chino directions to our house.  when chino asked him why he wanted directions, he said he had to ask a real cutie something.  it's so obvious what he has in mind.  now, explain to me slowly and clearly exactly what happened.  keoni is going to ask me to the lonoikeaweawe festival.  ..  and this is a catastrophe how.  only because i'm so not ready.  stitch, you stall him.  .. too pretty to come to the door.  and, pleakley, stay out of the way.  oh, you
