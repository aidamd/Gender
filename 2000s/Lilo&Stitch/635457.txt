 y motivated, you could battle, defeat, even destroy him.  see, that's the diff between you and me.  you are a fighter while i am a lover of sandwiches.  stitch: ow.   agatapa.  jumba probably doesn't even have a growing machine.  let's go downstairs.  pleakley made pineapple shortcake.  oh. ikiba.  here you are. voila.  one pineapple shortcake all done.  oh, nice.  put my eye out, why don't you.  what are you two doing.  stitch wants jumba's help.  he's off planet doing his community service.  he's a convicted evil genius, you know.  but maybe i can help.  see, stitch is looking for evil genius help, not pleakley help.  hey, i can do more than cook and clean, you know.  i was trained at galactic alliance community college.  i would make a perfectly acceptable substitute evil genius.  ..ok.  stitch thinks he needs to be bigger.  i think he's wrong, buthmm.  a little conundrum of molecular resizification, eh.  you may call me dr. pleakley.  do i not look positively evil.  why is stitch strapped down.  so he can't get away.  uh, for his own safety, i assure you.  now, as jumba says, "  ooh. ah.   uh, stitch isn't any larger.  of course not, silly, little girl.  that was merely to get me in the evil genius mood.  this is what will make stitch big: jumba's protoplasmic growth ray.  ohh. meega bigger.  now prepare for diabolical transmogrification.  i set the device at low power.  but it still might tickle.  ha ha ha.  i warned you it would tickle.  i warned you.   maybe jumba's back.  no.  i mean, you stay with stitch.  i'll get it.  don't worry.  you'll start growing soon.  pleakley: oh, lilo, could you come here.  coming.  be right back, stitch.   sorry to bother you, but you have something i want.  hand it over.  we don't havepleakley: lilo.  don't you want to tell the big brute exactly what he wants to hear.  297.  oh, right.  297.  which one was that again.  the tiny one designed to short out electrical machinery.  right.  and you saw it where again.  at the traveling amusement park with those rigged games of chance.  do you know that i, gantu, former captain of the galactic alliance, .  i'm sad for you, gantu, really.  but you can't have 297.  we caught him fair and square.  i don't need to play fair.  i'm bigger than you.   funny you should say that.  oh, blitsnak.  meega bigger.  lilo: wow.  you got overdone.   you better beat it, gantu, or i'll make stitch even bigger with jumba's growth machine.  growth machine. this isn't over.  whoa. uhh.  whoa. wahtoogie.  lilo: you ok, stitch.  he'll be fine.  he just hasn't grown in to his new size yet.  i think we made him too big.  could we shrink him a little.  naga. meega big.  ok, ok.  but we got to catch experiment 297, and you're definitely too big to be my little pal kitty.  don't worry.  i may be a substitute evil genius, but i'm also the fastest tuck and pleat 'em seamster sewing department.  it was an elective course i took.  either that or wood shop.  you two stay out of trouble now.  right. who am i kidding.  297's got tobe here somewhere.  all the ridesare busted.  you go that way.  i'll look over here.  ooh. yum.  oh. hi.  here. cccomplimentary.  just don't squash me.  my friend is big enough to go on this ride, right.  i'll say he's big enough.  he's too big.   ride's closed, anyway.  fifth one to break down today.  ha ha ha.  297.  cousin.  hee hee. ha ha.  whoa whoa.   mmm.  lemonade.   hee hee. ha ha.  gotcha.  you sure are a little guy.  i'm gonna call you short stuff, because you like to short out stuff.  ahh. meega big.  too big, if you ask me. come on.  so, experiment 297 was here all along.  no matter.  we will get it back.  feeling motivated yet, 625.  if by motivated you mean hungry, then yes.  aah.  so you're the little troublemaker.  uhh.  aah. watch it, you.  i'm a substitute evil genius.   he's asleep.  let's do it.   i know he likes being big.  but this is for his own good.  you're sure you can make him smaller.  don't be silly, little girl.  of course, it took a diabolical genius to unravel the riddle of "making him smaller," as you so simplistically put it.  but i, pleakley, magna cum laude, , and substitute evil genius, achieved it.  how'd you do it.  well, there's a switch here.  see. make big, make small.  make big, make small.  okeydokey, let's get small.  that's odd.   whoa.   huh.   ooh.  bigscreen tv.  short stuff.    aah.  lilo. bigger better.  uhoh.  here's your newdisney music playlist.  from the set ofsterling knight's music video, from the soundtrackfor the disney channel original moviestarstruck, in stores now.  starstruckis about a midwestern girl l l l l l and that's what's onyourdisney music playlist.  starstruckis really just a fun, uplifting movie.   ok, we got to get everyone back to normal size.  but we can't possibly shrink 297 now.  we need an extension cord of impossible length.  oh, how will we stop the monstrosity.  how, i ask.  meega bigger.  hmm. fight bigger with bigger, eh.  so instead of one giant monster, we'll have 2.  it's so crazy it just might work.  625: i don't want to go along.  i'm happy being unmotivated.  besides, my big, fat cousin is just gonna kick your blubber.  i what is that shaking.  hurry, stitch.  short stuff is headed back towards the carnival.  he must be drawn to all the mechanical rides.  we don't stand a chance against a giant trog.  ..  jumba's growth ray.  hee hee.  i hate it when you look at me like that.    truga.  ..aah.  these big monster battles never turn out well.      aah.  ouch.  aah.  lilo: so much for the pineapple plunger.  ohh, ow.  i guess there's no substitute for real evil genius.  i must agree.  jumba.  thank raflar you're back.  how did you find us.  return home and found growth device left out and giant footprints leading here.  it's not taking evil genius to figure.  meega bigger.  yes, and that is exactly why your patookie is getting booted.  lucky for you i have impossibly long extension cord.   now to shrinknagga.  bigger better.  for you, bigger is badder, not better.  you are perfect genius design made to operate at peak efficiency only at exact original size.  that's what i've been saying all along, stitch.  you're perfect just the way you are.  besides, when you're this big, your nostrils are really gross.  okie takka.  meega meega smaller.  626, this might tickle.  ohh.    now that's our stitch.    i know i could use some practice, but if you ever need a substitute evil genius again, ioh, no. you are like 626.  best made for one true purpose.  you mean being a highranking official in the galactic alliance.  no.  i mean disguising self like ugly earth female.  ha ha.  official. ha ha.  the alliance.  tagga chika.   ha ha. tay tagga chika.   chik chik. ha ha.   whoo. chabba chika.  uhh.  ahh. hata boogie.   uhh.  uhh. uhh.  taka.  way to go, stitch.  you david and goliathed him.  but no, this day belongs to me and my giant sidekick.   all: uhh.  lilo: aah.  you fool. you missed them.  oh, no, i never miss.  oh, no.  we already stopped for sandwiches twice on the way here.  in this case, bigger is definitely better.  ow.  now, it's time to fix your evil geniusing and shrink everyone back to normal, perfect size.   wait. don't shrink him yet.  i'm thinking he might have a big future.  hey, look.  lilo's back with her little, tiny friend.  he's not tiny. he's just right.  perfecto.  that's so sweet.  now get to the back of the line.  we're gonna go on the new ride before you.  ok, next.  ooh. hey, little miss.  come on in.  you know, you brought me the most popular ride in the whole carnival.  this is gonna be the best ride ever.  aah.  googa babba.  whoo.  captioninge possible byabc cable networks group captioning performed bythe national captioning

grilled cheese sandwich, huh.   hey.  ah, you know, he really is kinda cute when he's beached.  i just can't bear to wake him up.  you just rest.  ..  a little bit more.  perfect.  all ready for a first day at a new job.  wow, you did a really great job.  oh, you know, it was just the basicsa little mascara, liner.  it's all in the contouring, actually.  you look great.   well, i'm off to work.  wish me luck.  good luck.  nani, wait.  i forgot to give you this.  it's a good luck charm.  you're supposed to wear it around your neck.  stitch made it out of garbage.  you're welcome.  i'll just put it in my purse.  i'll see you after work.  we better check in on nani.  that charm is only 43% effective if it's in her purse.  ooh. what is it, stitch.   cousin.   oof. ichi bah.  whoa. oof.  'sup, lilo.  are you all right.  huh.  hah kata.  too bad this tree got the dry rot.  just make sure it falls away from the parking lot.  let me give you a hand.  no. i'm ok.  ii meant to do that, ..  i'm practicing for hula, about a mud monster.  huh.   ok, see you later.  i'm practicing for a hula about a mud monster.  what a loser.   no kitcha.  well, i can't ever face keoni again, but at least we caught another experiment.   i'm gonna change my identity and move out of town.  what do you think of the name tiffani, with an "i".  eww. )
