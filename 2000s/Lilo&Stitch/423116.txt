 what is he talking about.  who is this guy, amber.  amber.  this is my uncle, um, chester.  he gets confused easily.  he's lived a hard life of sun, surf, and a shave ice only diet.  and it's starting to catch up with him.  it's hard to keep up with all the figments of his imagination.   he thinks he sees aliens.  all: ohh.  ..i did get hit on the head by a coconut tree.  poor uncle chester.  why don't you just hit the beach, catch some waves, eat some shave ice, and maybe you'll feel better.  beach, waves, ice. yes.  that sounds very nice.    that is it, my creation.  come to jumbawhat are you doing.  get away from that button.  this is an unauthorized test of a potentially earthdestroying, evil invention.  yeah, but englobulatron might also not destroy earth.  why does scrawny nag being never see jumba's side.  has anybody seen lilo today.  5, 6, 7, 8.  and freestyle and freestyle and good.  and, amber, your hip isn't hopping.   amber. amber.  huh.  oh. oh, me amber.  and me tired of wasting my voice and my talent.  we're done for the day, ladies.  yo, what's up with that guy.  he reminds me of my uncle fabulo.  he wanted to be a dance instructor, too, before he found work as a shark tamer in the secret underwater circus.  stitch: tooka sabusa. tooka sabusa.  aah. aah.  oh, it's ok. he's just my dog, wenceslaus.  dabba gee.  what is it, wenceslaus.  gita jumba poosha.  pleakley conchamba canasha.  uhh. grr.  naga baba. pucha.  did your dog just do charades.  of course. right.  all the really rich people have exotic pets.  oh, cool. can he hang out with us.  meega.  let's go, stiuh, wenceslaus.  so what was he saying, anyway.  oh, some kind of trouble at the kaiulu school.  ha ha. the kailoser school.  with that redheaded weirdo who thinks she's so cool.  uh, yeah. that place is so oldschool.  who's up for some fusion girl fun.   oh, amber, you are so fun.  this day has been so cool.  oh. hello, myrtle.  what are you doing here.  and what happened to your hair and clothes.  you look even more like a freak.  ok, for your information, that's how all the rich people are dressing these days.  and what's with your outfits.  all: yeah.  her dad's the number 2 pineapple man.  jealousy is so sad.  tinko ta faba.  pbblltt.  girl: you said it, wenceslaus.  who's wenceslaus.  gantu: cowabunga.  there you are.  i've been looking all over for you.  hey, it's that figment of my imagination again.  if you don't find experiment 540, hamsterviel's gonna be furious.  how can he be furious if he's just a figment.  surf's up.   no, no, no. i forbid it.  you are standing in way of progress and blasting.  all right, you want to settle this once and for all.  i propose we use the only councilapproved method of conflict resolution.  yes. paper, rock, glornets.  one game. winner take all.  if you win, you get to test your device.  but if i win, i get to destroy it.  ..is deal.  little did you know i'm a paper, rock, glornets master.  galactic circuit undefeated in 157 matches.  they say i can read my opponent's mind.  eh, me, i always choose glornets.  now what.  why don't we go to your house.  ..i don't know if the robot butler has done all the cleaning.   what's going on.  it looks like a new experiment.  that, um, my rich science genius uncle fabulo is conducting with his wind machine.  i thought your uncle fabulo was a shark tamer in the secret underwater circus.  now what i have to ask myself is if you said you always choose glornets just to throw me off or if you're really that bad a player.  it all comes down to what kind of man is jumba.  impatient man. 540 getting away.  this what you play for, pleakley.  this is why you're the champ.  get inside his head. rock, paper, glornets.  think, man, think. you can do it.  ok, here goes.  both: 1, 2, 3.  paper.  glornets consumes paper.  i win. i win.  no.  no boom. it worked.  oh, jumba, you are a genius.  you really are a genius.  ..  pleakley: mutating. what happened.  i thought it was sleepy sleep or boomy boom.  76.3% chance success.  23.5% chance boom.  this was other 0.2% chance.   pleakley: whoa.  aah.  ohh.  what do we do now.  you've created a monster.  yeah. isn't it beautiful.  we have to get lilo.  dude, have you ever noticed the sun.  i mean, really noticed it.  it's so sunny.  and how, may i ask, is the beaching of your bum .  you're an adorable little figment, aren't you.  .  i am powerful and furious.  625, is your mind thinking what my vast brain is thinking.  uh, kick him in the rear.  uhh. uhh.   you miserable trog.  i'm going towait.  that actually hurt, not imaginary hurt.  you're real. bingo.  and what prize do we have for the big, ugly boy in the beach trunks.   i was really hoping i was uncle chester.  his life had some modicum of meaning.  but i see now that i'm  gantu.  yes, and you're "gantu" get me my experiment before i demote you to cave wiper at the intergalactic home for seasick animals.  everybody, back in the studio.  stay away from the window.  nani taught me what to do in a hurricane.  that's not a hurricane, it's ais experiment 540 gone englobulatron.  what.  jumba invented a new thing, but then it made that thing into a big thing.  540 must be stopped or will destroy entire island with mighty wind.  amber, who are these guys.  lilo: oh, um, this is my aunt athenia, ..  jumba.  jumba.  lilo: they're from out of town.  we have relatives dropping in all the time.  out of my way, trogs.  your family just keeps getting weirder.  they're not weird.  ..different.  whatever. are we going inside or what.  no. i have an experiment to catch.  unh. oof.  is there any way to disenglobulatron the experiment.  effect will wear off when goes to sleep, but, heh, 540 is not looking so tired just now.  sic him, boy.  rrarr.  unh.  look out.  huh.  acha boka mopa.   unh. oof.  whoa. aah.    hi. can i cower in here with you.  aah. aah.   stitch.  baba eeba.   way to go, stitch.  stitch. i thought his name was wenceslaus.  and that he wasn't a freakish mutant with 4 arms.  ..  there is no amber pineapple.  my name is lilo and that's my dog stitch.  hi.  lilo: and that's pleakley and jumba.  they really are my family, but we don't own a pineapple company.  i only pretended to be who i wasn't because i wanted to fit in.  so you're not a rich pineapple heiress.  nope.  ok, then you're just weird.  yeah, but i'm good with that.  huh.  grrr.  uh, i'll just save this for the next one, then.   " huh.  like typhoon, only cuter.  how's it coming, jumba.  plasmatic englobulatron is no more.  it seems new and improved was not much improved.  lilo: yeah, i know what you mean.  i'd rather be the old lilo than the new amber.  pretending to be somebody else is just too much hard work.  hamsterviel: why are you wasting time with this silly timewasting boardsurfing.  where are my experiments, gantu. gantu.  i don't want to be gantu.  gantu gets yelled at and hit on the head with coconut trees.  i want to be uncle chester.  cowabunga.  come back here.  turn around while i am ranting my rants at you.  i am not done ranting. gantu.  captioning made possible byabc cable networks group captioning performed by the national captioning institute, inc. )
