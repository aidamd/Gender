some of the disney channelstars you'll hear on the 15songdisney mania 7cd, out now.  . some people settle for the typical thing .  . i want to be where the people are .  so fromdisney mania 7, you're gonna get a whole variety of songs.  you're gonna get love songs.  you're gonna get rock songs.  you're gonna get songs like mine, which are, you know, upbeat and dancey.  it feels awesome to have a song on thedisney mania 7album.  it's my firstdisney mania album song ever, so i'm really excited.  . wish i could i be part of that world .  i absolutely love the little mermaid.  i was very much inspired by ariel, her beautiful voice and her ambition.  and i figured out how she would sound today and kind of brought that to my recorded version.  and i wanted it to be completely opposite from the original, so why not turn it into a highenergized dance remix.  . stand out .  .. .  so i picked the song stand out, which is from thegoofy movie, you know, one of my favorite disney movies of all time.  it was already an awesome song, and i figured we could just up the beat a little bit more and make it a little bit faster tempo and add a little bit more dance to it.  . till mine is the only face that you see .  .. .  i'm stoked to be ondisney mania 7.  there's honor society, tiffany thornton, demi lovato, alyson stoner, ksma bunch of really, really cool people.  thedisney mania 7cd is
