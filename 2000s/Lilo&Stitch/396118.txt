 pleakley: now this might pinch a little.  please try to be more cushy with the tushy.  .. ow.  mr. evilexperimentmaker.  wow. that's a huge bandage.  it's going to be long time before sitting on evil genius keister.  jumba, why weren't you affected by spike.  spike.  experiment 319.  i'm calling him spike.  name is all too appropriate, but to answer question, even jumba's superior alien bottom is not immune to spikey spikes.  then how come you're not acting dopey like stitch.  ..   well, for because jumba designed experiment 319 to take normally intelligent planetary populations and increase silly goof factor by 99% leaving only 1% clever.  so.  so even 1% jumba's brains is plenty super genius. ha ha.  heh. hi.  huh. grr. unh. unh. unh. unh. unh.  oh, brother.  tell me this is only temporary.  in 48 hours, 626 will be back to having brain like supercomputer.  until then you will have to settle for brain of a chicken salad.  ha ha ha. shouldn't laugh.  but the ohanarama is tomorrow and we need 3 people to play.  then little girl must compete.  i can't play against myrtle.  i'd just mess everything up.  what if i rebuilt stitch's smarts from scratch.  626 does have accelerated memory rebooting capabilities.  good enough for me. come on, stitch.  stitch.  guuh.  so what do we do with this guy.  just give me few minutes to recalibrate eviliminator.  oh, no, you don't.  but little girl is busy ununsmartifying experiment 626.  how is 319 supposed to be converted to good.  i'll use the dr. okra method.  it looks like we're all here, so let's begin.  using my extensive earth expertise, okra's theories into my very own seminar entitled "evil attitude remodification and wayward anger extraction," or as i like to call it, e.a.r.w.a.x.  oh.  we'll begin with level one: sharing.  fibber here will buzz if you don't tell the truth, so please speak openly and honestly.  does anyone have anything they'd like to share with the group.    anybody.  well, i have something, but, uhoh, no, no, please, go on, nosey.  you'll feel much better if you just get it off your chest.  ok.  his antenna thingy. it isn't really green.  experiments: oh. clyde: what.  wait a minute, youhe's going prematurely orange, but dyes it green at night so no one will notice.  no, i don't.   he plucks his unibrowyou're supposed to share things about yourself, not other people, especially me.  i'll share something about myself.  i'm bored. i'm too smart for this stuff.   hey, barney, if you're so smart, how come we ended up in the slammer.  oh, can it, clyde.  it's your fault we got nabbed in the first place.   why, you little soandso, i'll mangle ya.  let's just skip to level 5: aromatherapy.  where'd that come from.  none of your business.  now, aromatherapy, interestingly enough, is the study of smells, aromas and odorswaah.  grr.   yeah, now this is more like it.  this is better than taco night in the big house.  no, no, no.  senseless violence won't leave to hugging and crying.  you're doing it all wrong. waah.  that is supposed to be a chair.   ok, stitch, prepare for the ultimate cram session.  buggy.  cowboy.  pleakley.    why youaah.  aah.  whoo. i should be taking notes.  this is great stuff.  waah.  hee hee hee.  okra says we're supposed to be hugging and crying, we're gonna hug and cry.  oh, boy. me and my big mouth.    i don't think you're evil.  i think you're special.  you just need a big hug.  unh. yuck.    experiments: aw.  i'm sorry, clyde.  i'm sorry, barney.  i'm not gonna cry, i'm not gonna cry, i'm not gonna cry.     this is so beautiful.  i heard on tv that listening to mozart if that's true, listening to elvis will make you super smart.   you recognize him, don't you.  it's working. it's working.  let the king's music heal you.    ha ha ha. unh.  i give up.  stitch is just as big a dodohead as i am.  myrtle's going to win the ohanarama for sure.  will this take much longer, uh, myrna.  i've got a 5:00 yoga class tomorrow morning.  just remember to let me answer all the questions.  i wish we had someone smarter than me playing.  i stayed up all night studying the difference between argyle and gargoyle.  we're doomed.  ok, we're down to the final round in this year's ohanarama.  lilo, you won the coin toss so the first question for your ohana goes to you.  there is firm evidence of aliens from other planets visiting earth.  oh. true.  i'm sorry, that's incorrect.  edmonds. false.  only weirdlo's lame enough to believe in aliens.   the next question is for lilo's uncle jumba.  at opposition, how far is jupiter from the earth: 6 million, 60 million, or 600 million kilometers.  ahha. is tricksy many choice question.  thanks to subspace fold in fabric of solar system, actual distance to massive planet is 14 feet.  um, no, that's incorrect.  myrtle's ohana.   aunt stacy, you're wrong. no.  600 million kilometers.  that's correct.  . you dare question my genius..  i, who invented edible hair.  we'll get the next one.  maybe this would be a good time to take a break.  i can't believe it.  this is the worst day of my entire life.  aah. heh heh. thanks but no thanks, spike.  he's turned good thanks to e.a.r.w.a.x.  i know, but one stray quill and he could make me even unsmarter than i already am.  hey, i know.  spike, why don't you go give myrtle a big sloppy hug.  now, lilo, i'm no expert on earth ethicswell, actually i amand that would be cheating.  ohh. you're right.  if we're going to beat the edmonds we've got to do it fair and square. right, stitch.  come back, shiny.  come on, stitch.  no one's supposed to be back here.  moses hasn't asked a science question in a while, so i'll keep that page open.  good. just be ready to tell me the answers.  myrtle's cheating.  no wonder she seems so smart.  having to do slave work for myrtle.  i bet she could use a hug.  ha ha ha.  theresa: aah. get off me. buh.  come on, stitch.  i think we can handle myrtle now.  complete this phrase.  "for every action there is an equal and opposite " oh, a science question. that's easy.  ..  bucket of monkeys.  bucket of monkeys.  audience: ha ha ha.  i meanti'm sorry. that's incorrect. lilo's team.  considering multidimensional pull of deltarian antimatterreaction.  that's correct.   hmm. is highly oversimplified.  that's not fair.  oh, be quiet, maureen.  my name is myrtle.  maybe aunt stacy and i should answer some questions now, dear.  no. it won't happen again.  it better not.  duh.  for lilo's aunt pleakley, true or false: cotton tshirts should be washed with light colors only.  true. hey, i'm smart.  and with only 40 points separating the teams we go into the lightning round.  can i have one player from each ohana.  maybe aunt stacey shouldno. i'm going to play.  i should play. i'm the earth expert here.  well, yeah, but jumba has i.q.  larger than some galaxies.  no. let me do it.  but little girl thought notsofriendly friend myrtle was smarter than she.  not anymore.  weirdlo. i'm playing against you.  this is gonna be easier than i thought.  you don't scare me, myrtle.  are you ready, girls. first question.  where is the eiffel tower located.  in the bathroom.  in the bathroom.  paris, france.  10 points for lilo.  what did neil armstrong say when he landed on the moon.  tastes like chicken.  "this is one small step for man, " correct. how many feet in a mile.  bundt cake.  5,280.  who wrote hamlet.  chauncey pickles. william shakespeare.  and the score is tied.  i like pickles.  this is your final question.  " what kind of question is that.  i don't know anything about friendship.  that's easy. pilialoha.  that's correct. lilo's team wins.  audience: yay.   ha ha.  yay yay yay.  no fair. that was a dumb question.  just because you didn't know it doesn't mean it was dumb, myrtle.  congratulations, lilo.  your family wins the new computer and encyclopedias on dvd.  i can't believe we lost.  this is the worst day of my life.  aw.  myrtle: stop hugging me. ouch.  hey, that hurt, youuh, duh.   ha ha ha.  pleakley: nosey, do you have something you'd like to share with the group.  my name is nosey, and i'mi'm who would've thought spikey experiment would make such good hugging treatment practitioner.  heh heh heh.  wakata tooka tooka.  sorry, stitch.  i donated the computer to the community center.  i figure this family's smart enough without it.  little girl is almost as smart as evil genius. ha ha ha.  almost.  captioning made possible byabc cable networks group captioning performed bythe

frosting.  or the marshmallowsin the shape of robots.  marshmallow robots are not part of a nutritious breakfast.  pleakley lets me eat chocolate macadamia nut candy bar crunch for breakfast.  lilo, i don't have time for this.  i have to go to work.  well, i don't have time to eat yucky food.  life is too short.  here. put a little honey on top.  i said a little.  my sensitive taste buds need to be excited to work right.  please.  i can't wait till pleakley gets back tomorrow.  he let's me eat junk.   ..  jumba is appreciating ride to airport, but do not, i am begging you, walk me all the way to plane.  what.  you act as if i'm not going.  you have known for weeks you are not going.  conference is for scientific geniuses only to discuss new and exciting permutations of genetically engineered house pets.  i'm just doing it the way it's always done in the earth movies.  this is the painful parting scene.  riding to airport with ugly wife already plenty painful.  bon voyage, jumba.  don't invent any pets that could multiply, possess our bodies, and take over the entire planet.   ..  sorry i'm late, but that airport had great shopping.   what are you doing in my kitchen.  ..  cooking.  look, pleakley, i appreciate you helping me take care of lilo, but she's been eating too much junk food.  junk.  i beg to differ.  lilo eats only the finest and most expensive ..  light sugarfrosted pineapple pops.  cocoa nutty sugar rollups.  choco maca candy bar crunch.  just look at the faces of the happy, healthy children on the box.  all of that stuff is junk.  lilo's a growing little girl.  she needs to eat right.  so from now on, i'm making her nutritious meals in advance and leaving them in the freezer.  all you have to do is make sure she eats them.  from now on we're all eating healthy.  i won't eat it.  naga.  but you have to eat it.  it's so delicious and nutritious.  we want frosted cheese blobs.  yeah. enh.  lilo, your sister was very clear.  you have to eat this delicious vegetable loaf that she made for you.  later on, as a treat, you can have an apple.  a sugarcoated candy apple.  no, an apple that grows on a tree.  well, then, stitch and i are going on a hunger strike.  enh. yeah.  not one morsel of food will pass our lips unless it's covered with frosting, chocolate glaze, or powdered cheese.  all right. suit yourself.  that means that all this nummynum food nani left for you is now for me. yay.  mmm.  oh, could have used some salt.  but still pretty good.   it won't work.  stitch and i are solid like a rock.  right, stitch.  ..  i'm home for lunch.  hello. anyone here. unh.  lilo.  what are you doing on the floor.  stitch and i need to conserve energy because we're on a hunger strike.  i've written down my demands.  mega choco maca candy bar crunch cereal every day for breakfast.  easy cheesy macaroni and bacon bits every tuesday and thursday for lunch.  super spicy potato chips for dinner.  pleakley.  nani. what are you doing here.  i came home for lunch to make sure lilo was eating right.  it's not my fault.  she won't eat that food you made, and frankly, i don't blame her.  ..  pizzazz.  but it doesn't lack nutrition.   what's that noise.  ..  potato chips.  ..  you're eating potato chips while we're starving ourselves in protest.  ok, that does it.  this family is getting healthy.  from now on, no more junk.  pleakley, where's your stash.  stash.  i'm sure i don't know what you're talking about.  pleakley: see. nothing under the sofa cushions. )
