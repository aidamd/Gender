ticking stinkbomb.   stinkbomb.  this little guy.  very soon, it will emit odor so noxious, will make 40squaremile area uninhabitable for decades. ha ha ha ha ha.  but yet, he's cute as garment fastener.  well, he smells ok now.  254 is programmed to start stinking 42 hours after activation to allow time to infiltrate target.  the problem is we have no way of knowing when it was activated.  is the smell really that bad.   trust me.  will have you losing many lunches, his disgusting stench.   well, that's what i'm naming himmr. stenchy.  and i don't care how much he reeks, i'm keeping him.   )
