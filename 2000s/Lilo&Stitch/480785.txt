 of the enemy during war times.  even in an intergalactic fracas, eavesdropping is still not polite.  i wanna hear what she's saying on the telephone.  it's like they gave him an iq test, and the results were negative.  ha ha ha ha.  now, that is not polite, either.  i can't believe she's talking like this about david.  what do you do.  wash it with soapy water.  what do you do. what.  is easy. pet head like so.  aw, that's actually kinda cute.  but i'm telling you, listening in on people's private conversations is just wrong.  ..just wrong.  shh.  he's doing it again.  nani: he is so dumb, the mind reader gives him a discount.  ha ha ha ha.  that does it. nani.  i can't believe you're talking that way about david.  he likes you, and he's your friend, ..and...  ..hello.  oh, how's it, david.  we were talking about a movie we just saw.  i'll call you right back.  i'm in trouble, right.  first of all, don't accuse people of something if you don't have all the facts.  second, what were you doing listening in on my conversation.  ok, sorry. i won't do it anymore.  you better not.  gantu, come here this instant.  hey, looks like it's time for your weekly chewout.  sir, it was a very harrowing situation.  at the tiny earth children's playground.  yes, but it was difficult to maneuver.  gantu, how many times have i fired you.  uh, 4.  5, you unintelligent, not smart amphibian who makes me fire you 5 times.  and again i'm saying you're fired.  ..  shush, we're going to have to find something else for you to do.  woman: are you sure you wanna do this.  no, shush.  something else besides eavesdropping.  girl: but they're just no fun to play with anymore.  that's myrtle.  wah dah uhuh.  but, stitch, don't you wanna know who she's talking about.  they're not pretty, i don't like their clothes, and they're just kinda boring.  mother: all of them.  the darkhaired one, the one with the straight hair, and the little one.  oh, my gosh, she's talking about teresa, yuki, and elena.  yes. extra specially the little one.   what are you doing here, weirdlo.  i have to tell you something, something awful.  ok, but hurry up.  myrtle doesn't wanna play with you guys anymore.  she said you're boring.  myrtle would never say that about us.  stitch and i heard it with our own ears.  right, stitch.   i don't know.  she doesn't like your clothes, either.   but she tells us what to wear.  sorry, weirdlo, you're not allowed to play with us today.  it's a rule.  well, we aren't playing with you, either, myrtle.  lilo told us everything. huh.  it was kinda mean, myrtle, even for you.  butmyrtle edmonds, we don't wanna be best friends or any kind of friends with you ever again.  yeah. yeah.  come on, lilo, you can hang out with us now.  huh.  i don't know why you would turn all of my friends against me.  i'm just a pretty princess.  i can't help it. i'm just an ugly old troll.  i mean, i have a yucky blue dog, and i'm a weirdy, weirdy weirdo.   hello. yes, this is myrtle edmonds.  oh, yeah, i remember you.  what. you have a job for me.  sounds interesting.  i look forward to doing business with you.  heh heh heh heh.  hey surfers, we're going behind the scenes of the latest disney movie.  .movie surfers.  surfers, music is the heart and soul of new orleans.  and it plays a big part in the princess and the frog, a movie that returns to disney's classic roots where songs help tell the story.  we have a handsome prince in our story who's a big jazz fanatic, who's visiting new orleans.  prince naveen's passion for jazz starts on the wrong note when he meets mystery man dr. facilier.  a tip of the hat from dr. facilier.  he's a schemer.  one minute i'm a prince charming and handsome and then the next thing i know i'm tripping over these.  so one little tiny kiss.  just one kiss.  unless you beg for more.  leads to one massive adventure.  once tiana and naveen become frogs, this movie is head for the bayou.  and so are we.  in these woody swamps your likely to run into some pretty dangerous characters.  why are those logs moving.  those are not logs.  i got dibs on the big one.  not the safest place for a pair of clumsy frogs.  fortunately, our hopping heroes get some help along the way.  we have a cajun firefly named ray.  women like a man with a big fat pouch.  ray helped show them the light.  excuse me.  then there's louis, he's a big gator with a little problem.  i want to be human too so i can play jazz with the big boys.  and mama odie.  gumbo, gumbo in the pot watch ya got.  the fairy godmother who defies description.  not bad for a 197 year old blind lady.  she's a very positive spiritual element in the movie.  do you understand what you need now child.  it's a universal story.  i need to dig a little deeper.  you should always follow your dreams.  always.  come on y'all.  you dream big.  these characters are so alive.  ah, a shidanza.  it's a fairytale and musical.  it's a real adventure.  it's going to be good.  well surfers, that's just a taste of new orleans and disney's the princess and the frog.  coming to theaters soon.  see you later alligator.    y'all serious.  i love this part. you've seen it already.  yeah, like 3 times.  so what's gonna happen to the woman with the flowers.  shh.  she's gonna give 'em to her friend in the wheelchair.  that is so nice.  shh.  yeah, but then she's gonna get hit by a bus.  that is so sad.  will you keep it down.  maybe you guys should be quieter.  lilo, if we're gonna let you and your weird dogs hang out with us now, then you really shouldn't tell us what to do.  yeah. yeah.  shh. shh.   heuh, aloha.  yes, aloha it is, indeed.  what an adorable robot costume.  madam, this is no costume, but a highly advanced robot drone which i control remotely from an undisclosed location in what your underdeveloped human brain calls outer space.  of course it is.  you are so clever.  .  and you are.  jacques.  cute. myrtle.  got it, mom.  what'd you do, take a bus.  i see your winning personality is still very much intact.  fix, let's talk turkey.  ..  lilo, do you have any hair gel.  i'll go check.  pleakley, do you have any hair gel.  how do you think i keep my wig so healthy, lustrous, and hard as a helmet.   ..  ..  are those split ends.  it's not for me.  the hula girls wanna use it on stitch.  here. and it'll help with the smell.  teresa: i mean, now that we're not friends ..  shush, we shouldn't be doing this.  did you ever notice her hair's like the color of carrots.  other girls: yeah.  and she thinks everybody's gonna do whatever she says.  yeah. yeah.  and that her hair is carrotcolored.  we already said that.  yeah. i'm so glad lilo hurt her.  we wouldn't have known how totally not our friend she is.  lilo, i told you not to eavesdrop.  sorry.  you could end up hurting someone.  i didn't hurt anybody.  myrtle did.  but myrtle didn't tell her friends anything.  you did that.  but she's the one who said it.  in a private conversation that wasn't meant for you to hear.  no, but it's a good thing i did.  right.  wrong.  and nobody's any better off for what you did.  i think you need to straighten this out .. face to face.  voila.  did you find any hair gel.  ..  but stitch and i have to go somewhere.  ..by ourselves.  but we were gonna do the other doggy next.  maybe later. come on, stitch.  ..ottatakka.  so you want me to go capture those stinky dog things of lilo's .  exactly.  and why don't i take them straight to the dog pound.  ..because, uh...  because i because.  and why do you wantme.  you are rudely rude and pleasantly unpleasant, and you do not like the one called lilo.  that's the one thing you said i understand.  so you will do it.  i mean, it's not like i have anyfriends ..  thanks to lilo.  but i don't work weekends, nights, holidays, or whenever i don't want to.  and i don't wear a dopey red cape.  it's not dopey.  you try finding something that looks good with white fur.  unh. uhh.  ok, fine.  but i will have to ask you to wear this.  what is that thing.  oh, just a little something to help me keep in touch with you, and to turn you into a robot.  .   ha ha ha. yes.  turn you into a robot.  now i have complete control.  hoo hoo. ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.  ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.  ..  i should have done this to gantu years ago.   ready for mission.  yes. now bring to me experiment 234.  aloha, mrs. edmonds.  do you need some help.  unh. oh, yes. thank you.  these dolls are heavier than i thought.  dolls.  myrtle's decided to give away some of the dolls she's not playing with.  not playing with.  well, she doesn't think they're pretty, she doesn't like their clothes, and she thinks they're just kind of boring.   isn't that cute.  i'll tell myrtle you're here.  stitch, this is terrible.  i messed everything up with my eavesdropping.  it's just what nani warned me about.  i'll have to tell myrtle everything.   target identified.  myrtle, are you ok.   aah.  target pursuit.  aaaah.  target capture.  myrtle, .  give him back.  i think that is very unlikely.  losheebah.  you see, your not so friendly friend works for me now.  meet my new experiment hunter.  ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.  hamsterviel, i can't believe you turned myrtle into a robot.  you'll never get away with this.  ah, but already i have gotten away with this.  ready for my next assignment, master.  myrtle, quit saying that.  no, keep saying it. i like it.  losheebah. grrrrrr.   stitch.  the immobilizer ray is working nicely.  ha ha ha.  let us try it on the little girl.   stop right there, redhaired menace.  you are not taking my job.  uhhoh.  ha ha.  go away, you algaesmelling exemployee.  i fired you.  if i'm not working for you, then you can't tell me what to do.  what's this all about myrtle being the new dummy head, dummy head.  i will not let that happen.  i hope not.  she might actually be good at it.  that's it, get him.  the aiming on this thing is horrible. unh.  uhh. uhh.  hamsterviel: the immobilizer is wearing off.  ..ooh...ow.  waaah.  imbalance. defensive mode.  defensive mode.  give me that experiment.  whooahhh.  got him.  it'll be easier taking the trog from you.  chimito.  no, no, no, no, no.  this is not what i had planned in my planning stages. hey. hey.  blitsnak.  now get that experiment, you new experiment getter.  lilo:

others.  exactly. do it.  oh, yeah, do it.  ..  but it just wouldn't be right.  mmm, ok. here goes everything.   myrtle. weirdlo.  what am i doing here.  ..you got sick, so i brought you to my uncle.  he's a doctor.  .  how long have i been here. oh.  i'm probably covered inweirdgerms.  .. improvements.  aloha, guys.  you know, i think you guys are being to hard on myrtle.  i mean, none of this would have happened if i hadn't listened in on her conversation in the first place.  i know she's kind of difficult, and it was not very nice when she was shooting green rays out of her eyes, but sheis your best friend, andwe know. you do.  yeah. she told us everything.  i can't believe you thought she was talking aboutus when she was talking about herdolls.  yeah. yeah.  ready to go, girls.

man.  should have never trusted this person.  hello there.  howdyho.   however, i do have some former colleagues in virginia who might be interested in this creature's unique capabilities.  i thought
