find his one true place.  but 355 will not swap back willynilly.  must be properly motivated.   why not try a little positive incentive like offering the little guy some of my delicious cuisine as a reward.  excellent, my dear.  if 355 does not swap hamsterviel and gantu, he will be given nothing to eat except aunt pleakley's famous chocolate green beans surprise.  aahohh.  must you twist everything.   hi, lilo. i had to go home for dinner.  that was the funnest party anyone's ever thrown for me.  you're kidding, right.  no way.  but that party was totally weird.  don't you think i'm

ideas for our annualfund raiser.  i have one.  what does this island need more than anything.  less weirdos.  vampires.  .  and they pay good money for them to come to their luaus, weddings, and office parties.  so we put on fangs, and people pay us a dollar to chase them.  how about this.  a book sale.  we all write a superscary vampire book, and we each sell one million copies.  ew. girls, what smells.  oh. it's lilo's ideas.  ha ha. ha ha.  ha ha ha ha.  uhhh.  aah. ohh. aah.  does anyone else have an idea.  but i didn't get to the part where we all star in the movie version.  how about selling candy bars.  yeah. yeah.  that's a great idea. good idea.  vampire candy bars.  here's a chartwith everyone on it.  every time you sell a box of candy bars, i'll fill in the thermometer.  whoever sells the most wins thisa year's supply of shave ice from looki's.  . a year's supply..  wow. wow.  i love looki's shave ice.  i'm gonna win. i'm gonna win.  ..by scaring people.  stitch and i are gonna sell more candy bars than you or anybody.  no way. my mom sells real estate.  so i'm a naturalborn salesperson.  well, my sister says i don't know when to quit.  i'm going to win. i'm going to win.   oooh.  ooohh.  yum.  i don't know how you can sleep at night knowing that in the morning you will pulverize the flesh of a living thing and drink the fluids.  it's just pineapple juice.  oh, and i suppose when you squeeze an orange, .. just orange juice.  i just have to beat myrtle.  lilo, we do fund raisers to help the community.  that's the rewarding part.  the rewarding part is conquering your enemies until they beg you to be their friend.  you make raising funds sound very evil.  i must contribute.  all this selling objects for money is fascinating.  on my planet, there's no such thing as money.  wow, that sounds great. how does it work.  that's why folks on my planet generally don't wear pants. no money.   spuhka.  glug glug glug glug.  rrhh.  needs more toast.  we've got candy bars to sell.   he juiced the toaster again.   nah. chocolate gives me the burps.  aaahh.  grrr. rahrr. grrr.  amas ta'ya.  unhh. uhhhhyah.  raahh. raahh. raahh.     now, if you were selling vampire ..  aooorrr.  you don't want to buy a candy bar from a looser, and i don't blame you.  tsk tsk, little lady.  never walk away from a customer.  be proud of your product.  it's just candy bars.  "just candy bars".  was the louisiana purchase just louisiana.  look, i usually only do this for friends, but you, my friend, need some pointers.  just one dime for every dollar you sell. deal.  who are you.  my card.  "evil genius experiment number 020.  " arrhh. oh. cousin.  yes, sir, one of jumba's best.  he always hated the business end so he designed meprogrammed to sell anything to anyone.  a piece of code he obviously left out of you, pal.  wow. hee hee hee.  you gotta learn your 4 ps: product, pitch, persistence, and payment.  memorize it, exercise it. huh.  ooh. a customer.  the little lady, blue dog, and myself 00 candy bars that shall melt in mere hours.  if you could take them home for us, i would ask only $2.00 each. )
