like an evil genius rodent.  oh. right.  please go away, count freakula.  guess finder made a mistake.   we'd better keep looking.   ..  lilo: it's ok.  you're still the best tracker on the island.

plasma cannon. oh, it is ruined.  i'm calling animal control to pick up this dog.  no sign of him.  no. not even with my tracking experiment.  unfortunately, this means i'll need to take more drastic measures.  i don't understand it.  experiment 458 should have found hamsterviel easily.  lilo, there's a phone call for you from the animal shelter.  you're slicing them too thick.  you have to be able to fit it in your mouthwell, my mouth, which is much smaller than your grotesque maw.  now lay some mustard on me, baby.  computer:..  grand councilwoman of the galactic federation.  get out. oh.  gantu, i have an offer for you.  if you're successful, it could mean reinstatement of your captain's rank.  i'll do anything.  but you haven't heard what it is yet.  i don't care. lay some mustard on me, baby.  i mean, ma'am. terribly sorry.  please go ahead.  it's about the escaped dr. hamsterviel.  ..  associated with him.  but if you capture him and turn him over to us, all will be forgiven.   lilo: stitch.  stitch, what were you doing at myrtle's.   oh. hamsterviel.  you were trying to find hamsterviel without us.  but why.   'cause you wanted to find him before finder did.  i guess i kinda made you feel inferior, huh.  stitch, you're number one at so many things.  you shouldn't be upset if you aren't number one at everything.   ok. ok.  besides, finder made a mistake.  hamsterviel's not at myrtle's.   and i'm sort of the leader of these girls.  but sometimes, i think they don't even like me.  ah. that is your first mistake.  it doesn't matter if your minions like you.  they only need to fear you.  huh. i never thought about it that way.  now what.  gantu: i am here to apprehend you on orders of the galactic federation.  pleakley: slow down. i can't keep up.  ..  gantu.  ..  and he took myrtle, too.  if gantu attains his hyperdrive, all is lost.  now what do we do.    finder can fly.  aha. yes. i had almost forgotten.  was last minute addition in order to insure optimal tracking abilities.  tookie bah waba.  this looks familiar.  i cannot believe this aquatic excuse for a captain.  he has turned on me.  it's like you saidwhere's the loyalty.  gantu is a disgrace.  you, a mere child of a primate peoples, could do his job 100no, 1,000 times better.  i could.  believe me, you could.  perhaps when you have completed your education, you could come work for me.  hoo hoo ha ha.  computer: warning.  illegal genetic experiment on hull.  it's always something.  whoa.  whoa.  hey, cut it out, will ya.  i'm prone to vertigo.  computer, open window.  computer: window opening.  hey, what are youaah. aah.  get out there, and don't come back until you've knocked off that trog.  wait.  jakata quizda.  aah.  aah. unh.  all right. take it easy now.  heh heh. we're family, remember. heh.  ..  ow.  show off.  computer: warning. outage. crash is imminent.   now i won't be able to deliver hamsterviel to the councilwoman.  no need to worry about that.  i came to you. guards.  i fulfilled my part of the bargain.  i caught hamsterviel. where is my reward.  i suppose you dowhere's myrtle.  what is a myrtle.  she's a little girl like me.  gantu grabbed her when he took hamsterviel.  is this true.  well, i'm not sure. i haven't really looked.  i suppose it's possible.  so you put an innocent girl in danger.  you always did have a problem with ethics.  my offer is therefore rescinded.  let me go, you wretched olive shaped head woman with backwards legs.  the galactic federation thanks you for your help.  ..   stitch.  ..  if anyone deserves a reward hamsterviel, it is you.  hmm. finder did it.   yes, experiment 458 managed to track dr.  hamsterviel, but without your courage and daring, he would not have been apprehended.  but it's good of you to share the credit.  myrtle: what did you do with milton.  where's my talking gerbil.  excuse me, ms. grand councilwoman.  i have a favor to ask.   and when i escaped, i said, "eat my solar dust, you stinking pile " good boy.   a talking gerbil.  all: cool.  it's good to let other people have the limelight sometimes, isn't it.  uh.  i wonder how finder likehis new home.   captioning made possible byabc cable networks group captioning performed bythe national captioning institute, inc.  . there's 104 days of summer vacation .  . and school comes along just to end it .  . so the annual problem for our generation .  . is finding a good way to spend it .  . like maybe .  . building a rocket .  . or fighting a mummy .  . or climbing up the eiffel tower .  . discovering something that doesn't exist .  hey.  . or giving a monkey a shower .  . surfing tidal waves creating nanobots .  . or locating frankenstein's brain .  it's over here.  . finding a dodo bird .  . painting a continent .  . or driving your sister insane .  phineas.  . as you can see there's .  . a whole lot of stuff to do .  . before school starts this fall .  come on, perry.  . so stick with us .  .
