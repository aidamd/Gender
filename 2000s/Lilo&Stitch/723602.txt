 e she's talking like this about david.  what do you do.  wash it with soapy water.  feet. pull its tail. what. what do you do.  what.  is easy. pet head like so.  aw, that's actually kinda cute.  but i'm telling you, listening in on people's private conversations is just wrong.  ..just wrong.  shh.  he's doing it again.  nani: he is so dumb, the mind reader gives him a discount.  ha ha ha ha.  that does it. nani.  i can't believe you're talking that way about david.  he likes you, and he's your friend, ..and...  ..hello.  oh, how's it, david.  we were talking about a movie we just saw.  i'll call you right back.  i'm in trouble, right.  first of all, don't accuse people of something if you don't have all the facts.  second, what were you doing listening in on my conversation.  ok, sorry. i won't do it anymore.  you better not.  gantu, come here this instant.  hey, looks like it's time for your weekly chewout.  sir, it was a very harrowing situation.  at the tiny earth children's playground.  yes, but it was difficult to maneuver.  gantu, how many times have i fired you.  uh, 4.  5, you unintelligent, not smart amphibian who makes me fire you 5 times.  and again i'm saying you're fired.  ..  shush, we're going to have to find something else for you to do.  woman: are you sure you wanna do this.  no, shush.  something else besides eavesdropping.  girl: but they're just no fun to play with anymore.  that's myrtle.  wah dah uhuh.  but, stitch, don't you wanna know who she's talking about.  they're not pretty, i don't like their clothes, and they're just kinda boring.  mother: all of them.  the darkhaired one, the one with the straight hair, and the little one.  oh, my gosh, she's talking about teresa, yuki, and elena.  yes. extra specially the little one.   what are you doing here, weiro.  i have to tell you something, something awful.  ok, but hurry up.  myrtle doesn't wanna play with you guys anymore.  she said you're boring.  myrtle would never say that about us.  stitch and i heard it with our own ears.  right, stitch.   i don't know.  she doesn't like your clothes, either.   but she tells us what to wear.  sorry, weirdlo, you're not allowed to play with us today.  it's a rule.  well, we aren't playing with you, either, myrtle.  lilo told us everything. huh.  it was kinda mean, myrtle, even for you.  butmyrtle edmonds, we don't wanna be best friends or any kind of friends with you ever again.  yeah. yeah.  come on, lilo, you can hang out with us now.  huh.  i don't know why you would turn all of my friends against me.  i'm just a pretty princess.  i can't help it. i'm just an ugly old troll.  i mean, i have a yucky blue dog, and i'm a weirdy, weirdy weirdo.   hello. yes, this is myrtle edmonds.  oh, yeah, i remember you.  what. you have a job for me.  sounds interesting.  i look forward to doing business with you.  heh heh heh heh.  i love this part. you've seen it already.  yeah, like 3 times.  so what's gonna happen to the woman with the flowers.  shh.  she's gonna give 'em to her friend in the wheelchair.  that is so nice.  shh.  yeah, but then she's gonna get hit by a bus.  that is so sad.  will you keep it down.  maybe you guys should be quieter.  lilo, if we're gonna let you and your weird dogs hang out with us now, then you really shouldn't tell us what to do.  yeah. yeah.  shh. shh.   heuh, aloha.  yes, aloha it is, indeed.  what an adorable robot costume.  madam, this is no costume, but a highly advanced robot drone which i control remotely from an undisclosed location in what your underdeveloped human brain calls outer space.  of course it is.  you are so clever.  .  and you are.  jacques.  cute. myrtle.  got it, mom.  what'd you do, take a bus.  i see your winning personality is still very much intact.  fix, let's talk turkey.  ..  lilo, do you have any hair gel.  i'll go check.  pleakley, do you have any hair gel.  how do you think i keep my wig so healthy, lustrous, and hard as a helmet.   ..  ..  are those split ends.  it's not for me.  the hula girls wanna use it on stitch.  here. and it'll help with the smell.  teresa: i mean, now that we're not friends ..  shush, we shouldn't be doing this.  did you ever notice her hair's like the color of carrots.  other girls: yeah.  and she thinks everybody's gonna do whatever she says.  yeah. yeah.  and that her hair is carrotcolored.  we already said that.  yeah. i'm so glad lilo hurt her.  we wouldn't have known how totally not our friend she is.  lilo, i told you not to eavesdrop.  sorry.  you could end up hurting someone.  i didn't hurt anybody.  myrtle did.  but myrtle didn't tell her friends anything.  you did that.  but she's the one who said it.  in a private conversation that wasn't meant for you to hear.  no, but it's a good thing i did.  right.  wrong.  and nobody's any better off for what you did.  i think you need to straighten this out .. face to face.  voila.  did you find any hair gel.  ..  but stitch and i have to go somewhere.  ..by ourselves.  but we were gonna do the other doggy next.  maybe later. come on, stitch.  ..ottatakka.  so you want me to go capture those stinky dog things of lilo's .  exactly.  and why don't i take them straight to the dog pound.  ..because, uh...  because i because.  and why do you wantme.  you are rudely rude and pleasantly unpleasant, and you do not like the one called lilo.  that's the one thing you said i understand.  so you will do it.  i mean, it's not like i have anyfriends ..  thanks to lilo.  but i don't work weekends, nights, holidays, or whenever i don't want to.  and i don't wear a dopey red cape.  it's not dopey.  you try finding something that looks good with white fur.  unh. uhh.  ok, fine.  but i will have to ask you to wear this.  what is that thing.  oh, just a little something to help me keep in touch with you, and to turn you into a robot.  .   ha ha ha. yes.  turn you into a robot.  now i have complete control.  hoo hoo. ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.  ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.  ..  i should have done this to gantu years ago.   ready for mission.  yes. now bring to me experiment 234.  aloha, mrs. edmonds.  do you need some help.  unh. oh, yes. thank you.  these dolls are heavier than i thought.  dolls.  myrtle's decided to give away some of the dolls she's not playing with.  not playing with.  well, she doesn't think they're pretty, she doesn't like their clothes, and she thinks they're just kind of boring.   isn't that cute.  i'll tell myrtle you're here.  stitch, this is terrible.  i messed everything up with my eavesdropping.  it's just what nani warned me about.  i'll have to tell myrtle everything.   target identified.  myrtle, are you ok.   aah.  target pursuit.  aaaah.  target capture.  myrtle, .  give him back.  i think that is very unlikely.  losheebah.  you see, your not so friendly friend works for me now.  meet my new experiment hunter.  ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.  hey surfers, we're going behind the scenes of the latest disney movie.  movie surfers.  the latest animated feature from disney, the princess and the frog, puts a modern twist on a classic tale.  tiana is a regular girl leading a normal life.  i don't have time for dancing.   i'm making my own fairy tale.  until one day, the magic of new orleans takes over,  and life for tiana is never the same again.  ahhhhh.  i'm green, and i'm slimy.  look you are secreting mucus.  you. you.  and i caught up with anika noni rose at the studio to talk  about what it's like being green.  so, can you set up the story of princess and the frog.  my character, princess tiana, meets a frog who clams he is a prince.  i am prince naveen.   i'm not done yet.  there sort of at odds in the beginning.  tiana is the type of person who is going to work for what she wants and naveen, he is the type of person who has had everything giving to him his hole life which leads him to being webby.  oh oh.    i am a price charming and handsome.  cutting a rug, and the next thing i know i'm tripping over these.  they go on this grand adventure.  comon' child.   can you tell us about some of the challenges that they face.   there are a lot of challenges in a swamp  where you're running into alligators and frog hunters.  oh, i got me one boys.    so, it's about not only finding away to go back  to being human, but finding a way to get back to new orleans and make things right.  let me shine a little light on the situation.  excuse me.  so tiana is not a very big fan of frogs, but how do you feel about them.  i actually love frogs.   i'm really excited about doing something where i get to touch a frog.  would you ever kiss a frog.  and that's where it ends.   i will not be kissing a frog.   come we pucker.   that's new.   you can catch more of tiana and her magical friends  when disney's princess and the frog,  jumps, hops, and skips into theaters soon.  bye surfers, see ya there.  hamsterviel, i can't believe you turned myrtle into a robot.  you'll never get away with this.  ah, but already i have gotten away with this.  ready for my next assignment, master.  myrtle, quit saying that.  no, keep saying it. i like it.  losheebah. grrrrrr.   stitch.  the immobilizer ray is working nicely.  ha ha ha.  let us try it on the little girl.   stop right there, redhaired menace.  you are not taking my job.  uhhoh.  ha ha.  go away, you algaesmelling exemployee.  i fired you.  if i'm not working for you, then you can't tell me what to do.  what's this all about myrtle being the new dummy head, dummy head.  i will not let that happen.  i hope not.  she might actually be good at it.  that's it, get him.  the aiming on this thing is horrible. unh.  uhh. uhh.  hamsterviel: the immobilizer is wearing off.  ..ooh...ow.  waaah.  imbalance. defensive mode.  defensive mode.  give me that experiment.  whooahhh.  got him.  it'll be easier taking the trog from you.  chimito.  no, no, no, no, no.  this is not what i had planned in my planning stages. hey. hey.  blitsnak.  now get that experiment, you new experiment getter.  lilo: hey, myrtle, look at me.  must destroy lilo.  no, no. get the experiment.  here i am.  aah.  aahha.  no, no. shield up. shield up.  .. immobilized.  hurry, stitch.  let's get her to jumba.  maybe he can derobotify her.  get up and work, you immobilized pile of immobile robot parts.  eh, will be easy to fix.  eye covering pieces basic model t179.  huh, on home planet, can buy at convenience store.  will she remember being a robot.  uh, sadly, no.  uh, just wondering, before i deactivate, .. improvements.  ..  to turn her from a holy little terror into someone kind, caring, and considerate of others.  exactly. do it.  oh, yeah, do it.  ..  but it just wouldn't be right.  mmm, ok. here goes everything.   myrtle. weirdlo.  what am i doing here.  ..you got sick, so i brought you to my uncle.  he's a doctor.  .  how long have i been here. oh.  i'm probably covered inweirdgerms.  .. improvements.  aloha, guys.  you know, i think you guys are being to hard on myrtle.  i mean, none of this would have happened if i hadn't listened in on her conversation in the first place.  i know she's kind of difficult, and it was not very nice when she was shooting green rays out of her eyes, but sheis your best friend, andwe know. you do.  yeah. she told us everything.  i can't believe you thought she was talking aboutus when she was talking about herdolls.  yeah. yeah.  ready to go, girls.  ..again.  i guess i had that coming.   come on, stitch.  i think i know where shush belongs.  we gotta make a phone call.  shush, it's just not right ..  unless you're an agent of the secret, underground government.  i no longer operate in that area, lilo.  i'm just a normal social worker paying a normal house call.  pleakley: she is giving your little monster to that strange, frightening man.  should have never trusted this person.  hello there.  howdyho.   however, i do have some former colleagues in virginia who might be interested in this creature's unique capabilities.  i thought you might.  you can have yourstinking job back.  thank you, sir. thank you.  i promise you will see a more determined gantu who captures many, many more experiments.  i am only rehiring you so that i mayberate you.  i shall beginwith your clumsiness.  you are so clumsy.
