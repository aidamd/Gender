i can't waste my precious time on something as banal as an orchid.  my pinormous needs me, and the world needs my pinormous.  aah.  my personal eden is being invaded by bamboo runners.  runners.  underground roots spreading their grasping, choking evil from the mother plant.  couldn't whoever planted this contain the roots so it wouldn't keep spreading.  so inconsiderate.  now who's gonna help me grow an orchid.  pleakley: don't you have a sister or something.  i'm sorry, lilo, but i don't have time to help you with the fair.  i'm working.  but i want to enter something.  uh, miss. do you

cowboys wear boots, not flippers.  look, it takes a long time to grow an orchid.  maybe you could enter next year.  oh, uh, miss.  i'm sorry, but this onethe mask doesn't fit 'cause your head is shaped weird.  bashooga.  heh heh. kids.  i'm gonna have to stay away from maiapulai cove for a whole week if i don't find some way to beat myrtle.   stitch. are you listening to me.  yeehaw.   great.

couldn't hurt.  hello, blue ribbon.  cool.  let's give you an extra shot of muscle.  hey. you like that.  good. now you're ready for the fair.  see you tomorrow, sprout.  good morning, sprout.  whoa, nellie.  he's beautiful.   stitch.  help me repot sprout so we can take him to the fair.  stitch: kata.  wow.  howdy.  lilo: this is so cool.  after we win blue ribbons, let's ride the hurlawhirl.  where's the competition.  my pinormous is heavy.  there's room on my wagon if you want.   uhuh.  that thing might hurt my pinormous.  oh, yay.  there's the competition.  blue ribbon and eternal fame, here i come.  i think this looks just like an orchid.  don't you.  mmm, nada.  man: howdy, stranger.  i hear you're the only other bull rider in this here competition.  you see this.  i got 5 of 'em.  one for each time i won the rodeo.  ..  to a stranger.  ah kata.  help me get sprout in place.  then you can kick that cowboy's rear in the rodeo.  vachoo.  ha ha ha.  hey, son, a real cowboy don't get told what to do by a little girl.  shimmyching.   rockahula.  my little sprout's all growed up.     neecha.  i know. i know.  it's almost time for the rodeo.  you're not an orchid.   aah. aah.  uhoh.  woman: i've been hoping this orchid would grow up to be a contender, but the competition is so stiff this year.  did you see mali makakau's cymbidium.  i mean, really.  i don't have a chance.  well, it's not whether you win or lose.  it's how you play the game, right.   woman: this is one remarkable pineapple.  pinormous, please. pinormous.  well, i certainly haven't seen anything to rival the pinormous.  yes, indeedy.  i think the pinormous deserves the blue ribbon.  oh, thank you. thank you.  you've no idea how much this means to me.  all my hours of toil rewarded with this sweet, sweet victory.   what is that.  oh. there's another one.  aah. no.   announcer: well, here we are, moments away from the bull ridin' competition.  can zach makeli hold on to his 5year run as the champ.  or will a new competitor known only as "the stranger" give him a ride for his money.   yeehaw. whoohoo.  announcer: zach makeli's in rare form today, folks.  he only needs to hang on for 8 seconds for an official ride.   announcer: and there it is.  let's see what the judges have to say.  announcer: boy, howdy, it's a 99.  hello. zach makeli beats his own record.  chewbata.  ride 'em, cowboy.  bajo.  announcer: well, folks, this stranger may be small, but he's determined.  good night, marie. he's standin' on one hand.  stick a fork in zach makeli, folks.  that ol' cowboy is done.  crowd:..6...  7.  aah.   this is so bad.   ooh. pajumba.  ochaka.  oh. aah.  i think i unleashed botanical evil on the town fair.  .  waa.  tractors, mowers, chippershredders.  it's like evilplantbattling heaven.  aah.  waa. chekava grisna.   whack 'em, stitch.  stitch.  i need trimming.  ooka yada.   we gotta get to higher ground.  they're everywhere.  all my fault.  jumba locked the experiment in a drawer 'cause he knew it was dangerous, and i took it anyways, just so i could beat myrtle.  i messed up everything.  you could at least pretend i didn't mess up so bad just to make me feel better.  i cannot.  . i'lllook. there's sprout.  all these other plants must have spread from the original.  it's like the evil bamboo pleakley told me about.  he said he wishes someone had contained its roots.  maybe if we put the original sprout's roots in a container, it won't be able to spread.  uh.  but sprout is mongo size.  what'll we put him in.  ah, vangeva.  whoa. wait.  where are you going.  hey. i can see my house from here.  hurry up.  they're spreading.  yeehaw.  female reporter: we're here at the kokaua town fair where apparently a giant orchid has burst ..  . ...causing pandemonium.  jumba.  what. what is emergency.  what do you know about that.  reporter: i've never seen anything like this.  it's as if alien plants have taken over the fair.  james, are you getting this.  oh, no. oh, no. aah. no.  is 509, but look much heavier on television.  little girl has been breaking big rules.  stitch. hurry.  whoa, bachia.  ha ha ha.  yano streeta.   hey, stranger, let me give you a hand. catch.  much obliged.  right on, stranger.   yay, stitch. it worked.  hey, stitch, how're you gonna contain his roots.  ha.  works for me.   i don't know if it's his one true place, but that's about the only place i think sprout could go.  unh eh.  well, would you look at that.  wasn't that one of the entries in the orchid category.  why, yes. yes, it was.  i think we've found our blue ribbon.  here you go, dear.  you know, if it hadn't have been for that overgrown dandelion, you'd have beat me in the rodeo.  aww.  no. no, sir, you would have.  i gotta admit it, because a real cowboy either wins fair and square, or he loses fair and square, partner.  oh, chochamba.  here.  is this a trick.  no, you won it fair and square, and i didn't.  maiapulai cove is yours for a whole week.  really.  yeah.  we get to go to maiapulai cove without the weirdo for a whole week.  all: hooray.  a real cowboy knows how to losefair and square.  lilo.  oh, lilo, are you ok.  i'm ok.  am i grounded.  what do you think.  i guess a month would be fair.  how about a week.  mymy beautiful pinormous.  innocence lost.  if we start planning for next year, i bet you can grow orchids that will kick myrtle's orchid's butts.  lilo: wow.  i didn't even know orchids had butts.  stitch: oh. yippeekiyay.  captioning made possible bydisney channel department of education
