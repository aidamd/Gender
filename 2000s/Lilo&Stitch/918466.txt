 but i'm not a tourist. i just moved here.  moved. ok, i can talk to you.  i'm lilo.  ..do you take hula.  are you kidding. hula is my life.  i'm starting hula class tomorrow.  maybe i'll see you there.   ok. well, bye.  i mean aloha.  preparing to transport experiment 355.  send it immediately.  what does it do again.  experiment 355 swaps the minds of any 2 individuals.  send it to me.  ..we appear to be having technical difficulties.  ..  oops.  why are you oopsing at me, you overly large lard bucket.  well, sir, the experiment, apparently, it ..ahem...  escaped.  . once again, i reiterate, you are the lamestwhy don't i just fire you andandandwhat is going on here.  i'm so large and rubbery.  eehh. a big fluffy rat.  waitno. that's me.  .. i have become you.  and you've become me.  ahchoo.  why are you making such annoying noises.  apparently, i'm allergic to your dander, sir.  ahchoo. but not to worry.  i'm sure the experiment can swap us back to our normal bodies.   no. come back here.  ..too...tiny.  how do you do anything with these flabby, slothlike appendages.   once again, i am forced to pay for your incompetence.  now i must go and capture that experiment myself.  yes, sir. then you can swap us back.  ..  no.  for me, that would mean going back to prison.  well, yes, i suppose itahchoowould.  ah ha ha ha. i'm free at last.  but sir, that's not fair.  who cares about fair.  can you believe it, stitch.  a new kid.  we never have a new kid.  ..did aunt pleakley's famous lemonade sell like hot pies.  that's hotcakes. and stitch drank the profits.  aah. what's happening to him.  jumba: hee hee hee.  i see uncle jumba's secret ingredient worked like charm, eh.  did you add something evil to aunt pleakley's famous lemonade.  what evil.  changing colors is big fun for little children.  aloha, lilo.  aloha, victoria.  is your dog still turning colors.  uh, no. for him, blue is normal.  hey, victoria.  you should come hang out with us.  that way you won't get any weirdlo cooties.  yeah. yeah. yeah.  she's weird.  weirder than weird.  she's a freak.  lilo, you haven't eaten a thing, and i made your favoritechocolate green bean surprise.  there is hardly any radioactivity this time.  you didn't. not again.  ah, relax. i'm joking.  mostly.   well, lilo didn't think it was funny, and i didn't either.  little girl is sad because you managed to ruin perfectly good chocolate with disgusting green beanses.  i'm not sad because of the food.  .. because i almost made a friend who doesn't think i'm weird and myrtle ruined it.  whoo. thank goodness.  i thought it was something serious like my green bean recipe.  ..i mean... you almost made a friend today.  that's nice.  everybody thinks i'm weird.  myrtle, and keika, teresa, and elena.  i thought maybe victoria would think i was normal and be my friend.  it's never too late to make a friend.  you just need to reach out to her and show her you can be a friend right back.  hmm.  i guess i could throw a welcome party for her.  did you say party. i'm all about parties.  what's the theme.  i've got a theme.  ..not...weird.  hmm. lilo's not weird.  i'm not sure that's a good theme, because, objectively, ..  pretty.  you are so pretty.  oh, so pretty and witty.  hey, so lilo's not weird is the theme then.  i have some great nonweird recipes.  and we can get supplies from that exciting new superstore just outside of town.  they have incredible partyplatters at incredible prices.  it's official. we're throwing a party.  yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea.  we have lots of stuff to do before the party tonight.  we need decorations, a party platter, and i need to get a haircut.  what's the matter, stitch.  do you hear something.  cousin.  one of your cousins. here.   cousin.  cousin.   good job.  stitch.  stitch. what's happening.  maka maka no waka.  oh, no. i'm you and you're me.  what happened.  how come i'm you.  cousin.  but i can't be you for the party.  that would be so not normal.  make 'em swap us back, stitch.  ahem. camisatoontuka.  pffft.   ow, ow, ooh.  stitch, you can't try to break stuff when you're me.  i'm not built for mayhem and destruction.  we gotta talk to jumba.  but if we go back now, we won't have time to shop for the party.  we're gonna have to split up to do our chores.  ohh. okutaka.  just tell 'em to take a little off the ends, ok.  i'll come back and get you after i buy the party platter.  ok.  stitch.  try to act like a biped.  sorry.   hee hee. whee.  oh.  oh. wow.  hey.  can i help you with something.  ..  ..a...  haircut.  well, go on, then. take a seat.  now, what do you want done today.  ..a little...  here, you look through this and show me what you want.  mmm. naga. naga.  naga.  ooh. look at this.  ..you sure about this, brah.  oh, yeah.  all right. you asked for it.   all right, let's see.  sodas, chips, and deluxe party platter.  should be no problem.  sorry, doggy. can't come in here.  what's so funny.  doggy.   what is that.  lilo: whoa.  i'm looking at a 304 in aisle 83.  uhoh.  hey, wait a minute.  cool.  come here, you.  hey, this is fun.  ..whoa.  they'll never find me here.  gotcha.  ..  ..  3. oof.  it didn't even hurt.  it's like being an indestructible zombie.  stitch, the theme of the party is lilo's not weird.  i can't show up with that hair because that hair is weird.  sorry.  all my fault.   it's ok.  i'll just wear a hat and serve peanut butter and jelly, because there's no party platter.  just as long as we get our own bodies back.  experiment 355, we meet again.  ah, ah, ah.  none of your tricky trickiness with jumba.  jumba likes evil genius brain.  we kinda figured out what his power is.  he's a brain swapper, right.  he once swapped me and wife for an entire month.  you must have learned a lot about each other.  oh, yeah. now she's exwife.   long story. don't ask.  we've gotta get him to swap us back.  355 will swap you back when he is good and ready.  has mind of his own.  is funny, no.  the guests for victoria's party are gonna be here any minute.  i can't be stuck in stitch's body.  well, i've done it again.  i made the galaxy's best lemon bars.  jumba, how many times must i tell you to pick up your laundry and put it in the hamper.  355no.  i've been zapped into an alternate dimension.  a place where the laws of time and space are topsyturvy.  don't be ridiculous.  our minds have been swapped.  you are seeing world through my infinitely superior eyes.  ..  weird.  and to tell you the truth, tubby.  bahhf.  at least i can see difference between near and farwhaa.  stupid single eye.   the guest of honor is here, and we're all brainswapped.  that's as weird as weird can be.   ok, everybody.  act like your normal selves.  well, not your normal selves.  but the other person's normal self.  pleakley, what are you doing.  i can't see a thing with all these eyes of yours.  there, that's much better.  you think my eyes are problems.  how you can walk with 3 legs in dress with only one eye is beyond meoohoww.  we're gonna have to work harder to fit in with the lilo's not weird thing.   well, go ahead. answer the door.  oh, wait.  go ahead.  hi, lilo.  oh, uh, hi.  ok, weirdlo, we weren't planning on coming to your party till we heard the theme.  start proving you're not weird.  uh, ok. refreshments.  did someone say refreshments.  i made fabulous lemon baruh, lemon blobs.   well, you could at least try them.  you must be aunt pleakley of aunt pleakley's famous lemonade.  why, yes. yes, i am.  guilty. ha ha ha.  anyone in weirdlo's family is probably just as weird as her.  victoria, you should stick with the cool people in town before you get downgraded.  you take that back.  my family's not weird, and you wouldn't know cool if it beat you on the neck like a vampire.  i mean, heh heh, woof.  ah, this is inconceivable.  i am dr. jacques von hamsterviel.  how is it that i cannot find .  here you go, buddy.  chin up, big guy.  i'm sure it'll get better.  aah.  hello.  it is i.  i knew you'd call.  unf. all right, i admit it.  it isn't easy being so big and clumsy.  there. are you happy now.  getting there. what do you want.  i want to know how we can find that stupid experiment so we can swap bodies again.  i know just the place you should check.  ahchoo.   i know. let's play a game.  myrtle: do you have a cold or something.  you sound awful.  uh, yes. aa cold. very sick.   ahchoo. ahchoo.  ew. stay away from me with your germs.  this party's a disaster.  we have to do something.  ha ha. um, i know.  hello.  hey, ii do special hula now.  . la la la la .  . la la la la .  . la la .  huh.  unh.   oh, that does it.  you're the weirdliest weirdlo in weird town.  we're out of here. come on, victoria.  but i'm having fun.  boy, did you ever say the wrong thing.  we don't even wanna associate with anybody who actually has fun with lilo.  right, girls.  yeah. yeah. yeah.  greetings, earthling half people.  i have come for the experiment known as 355.  whoa.  megonala. quista.  new roofing system i installed working perfectly.  keeps repair bills down.  very thoughtful.  unh. unh. unh.  stitch, let me do that.  you take care of the experiment.  whoa, this is so easy.  i got you a present, you big dummy.  ..  and yet so sensitive.   whoa.  ok, now who am i.  you are me, and i am 626.  ah, this is much better.  now i shall relieve you of that pesky experiment.  hey, that's not gantu. it's hamsterviel.  they must have got swapped, too.  komigo.  chachuka tariso.  aah. my eyes.  can't see. burning acid. aah.  not acid. just the galaxy's best lemon blobs.  also useful for blinding bad guys.  ..  ..  hey. i'm me again.  me, too, am me.  ah ha ha ha ha ha.  please. put me back in my own body.  put me back in prison.  if you insist.  stitch, would you do the honors.  after 355 swaps him back, we'll find his one true place.  but 355 will not swap back willynilly.  must be properly motivated.   why not try a little positive incentive like offering the little guy some of my delicious cuisine as a reward.  excellent, my dear.  if 355 does not swap hamsterviel and gantu, he will be given nothing to eat except aunt pleakley's famous chocolate green beans surprise.  aahohh.  must you twist everything.   hi, lilo. i had to go home for dinner.  that was the funnest party anyone's ever thrown for me.  you're kidding, right.  no way.  but that party was totally weird.  don't you think i'm weird.  well, maybe a little.  i knew it.  i like weird. weird is interesting.  i mean, i'm even weirder than you are.  you're not weird. you're cool.  i have a collection of potato chips in the shapes of celebrities from the 1970s.  really.  i'll show it to you sometime if you like.  cool.  by the way, i like your hair.  captioning made possible byabc cable networks group captioned by the nationalcaptioning institute www.ncicap.orgnarrator: "the changing of the seasons "brings wonder to the
