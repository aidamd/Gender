 grr.  computer: warning. experiment 523 activated.  oh. a freeze inducer. perfect.  i'll turn this sweltering mud ball into something livable.  ..  you want yours medium, or well done.  knock it off.   ok. plan "b" to beat the heat.  shave ice.  ooh. they have new flavors.  blah.  you've never even tried them.  yech.  grr.  fine. more for me.  here you go. one lilo experiment.  pink, blue, and black.  elvis' favorite colors.  the heat's busted my ice maker.  don't know what i'm going to do if i can't fix it.  but i think i can scrape up another one for your dog.  forget it. he never tries anything new.  besides, he got in trouble for grand theft soda.   he almost got arrested.  arrested.  i had to give the soda back.  and the money.  but it's ok, though.  he doesn't have to go to a federal prison.   miga toomae.  whoa blah.  stitch, i got you one anyway.  ..  ..  snow.  it'sit's snowing.  this is so great.  let's tell everybody.  stitch: naga takaba.  it's just snow.  it's not going to hurt you.  get down from there.  naga.  515, your thermostat is adjusted.  hot waves should no longer overheat you.   don't mention it.  splodyhead, beware.  beware.  jumba, we're being invaded.  millions of little white aliens are landing outside, as we speak.  invaders.  you need to lay off the coconut cake.  we must quarantine this area against the invasion.  it may already be too late.  what.  what invasion.  little white aliens falling from the sky.  i may already be a victim.  you're talking about snow.  it's frozen rain.  harmless.  huh. ha ha.  ok. you caught me.  just pulling a little joke, there.  i, being an expert on this planet, of course knew it was snow all the time.  a fascinating new earth weather to experience.  and, i'm not being slowly consumed by an evil parasite.  yay. whoo.   jumba: experiment 523 wasn't my most evil one.  mostly, it makes ice and snow.  brr. blah.  his reaction is expected.  626 does not like snow.  is form of water.  pleakley: i agree with stitch.  i don't like snow anymore, either.  that is too bad.  because experiment 523 will continue his deep freeze programming.  he will make icy blizzards, mile high snow drifts, and keep all leftovers edible for up to 6 months.  for better to spread his freezing cold breath everywhere, 509 will go to highest point on island.  that's mount waialeale.  come on, stitch.  naga takaba.  i have an idea that will keep you warm.  ready.  grr.  i hope the toast you're wearing stays warm.  i made it extra dark.  the little troublemaker is going to freeze the whole island if we don't get him.  it's icy, so be careful not towhoa.  uhh. slip.  grr.  ha ha ha ha ha.  i'm going to need more toast.  lilo: stitch.  stitch.   gotcha.  not even the trog could stop you.  ..me.  ha. you missed.  that's what you think.  huh. jakata crista.  you aren'taren't going to leave me like this, are you.  no.  aah.  blitsnak.  hello, cousin.  pleakley: finally.  the sun is back, and so are you.  you must've caught the little snow monster.  his name is slushy.  oh, thank the kings of bruplok 5.  no more of that freezing cold snow.  it's awful. just awful.  actually, is not awful enough.  only makes everything cold and wet.  heh. no. not very evil at all.  but it makes snow, and that's good.  you can slide on it, throw it at each other, even make snow zombies out of it.  so, want to try it with me.  all: no.  well, fine.  go inside. i am going to play in the snow.  all right, slushy.  do your stuff, but only for my house.  .. catch that experiment...  .. go any faster.  sure. i could use your blaster.  of course, you know what a lousy shot i am.  i mean, i might miss and hit you in the patookie.  no. no blaster.  i like my patookie.  i'm so glad you could come by and play with me and stitch, myrtle.   well, i'm not.  i think you and your dog are weird.  me and stitch are sorry you feel that way, myrtle.  here. have a snowball.  whoops.  looks like you're going to need head surgery.  did you see that.  snow can be delightfully evil, after all.  let's go outside.  pleakley: but the cold.   lilo: oh. hey, stitch.  aloha.  i know you weren't just looking outside at the snow, because you don't like it.  yeah. ick.  i understand.  i forgot to give my snow stitch arms.  these forks will work.  see ya.  snowflakes compacted into sphere makes for excellent projectile, heh.  ..  ha ha. very funny.  now all we need is something for you to fire.  ha ha ha ha. unh.   aah.     ohh.  ha ha ha ha.  whee.  yay.  oh, no.  ow.  oh.  brr. we better go tell slushy to cool it.  or, maybe not cool it.  oh, dear.  the snow maker got away.  look. gantu got him.  this is bbad. right.  yep.  good thing you like snow now, huh, stitch.  jumba: indeed.  experiment 523 works better than ever dreamed.  if ice spewing continues, entire island will be transformed from tropical paradise to frozen tundra forever.  it's very evil after all. ha ha ha.  oh, right.  not big fans of evil.  heh. sorry.   he  hey surfers, we're going behind the scenes  of the latest disney movie.  .movie surfers.  hey surfers, welcome to new orleans.  that's right, it's where the new animated adventure the princess and the frog comes alive.  you will enjoy. i guarantee.  so why set the movie here.   well the animators needed a city where alligators love jazz.  .jazz trumpet.   humans get transformed into frogs.  that's new.  and magical adventures might be waiting just around the corner.  new orleans is a wonderful city.   it was a city that lent itself to the magic and the mystery  and the music that we wanted to incorporate.   which is perfect for telling a fairy tale story.  it's beautiful, no.  there's no other place like new orleans.   wow, it's wonderful.  new orleans is also the home of mardis gras.   and elaborate costume balls.   it's a city where anything can happen.  and the food is amazing.  order up.  what just happened.  which makes this city perfect for tiana, the movies hard working heroine.  the princess's ultimate goal is to have her own restaurant.   but she wants to do it her way, and on her terms.  .i'm almost there.  her philosophy is you gotta make your own fairytales come true.   certainly, she's not a character who's waiting  for a prince to rescue her.  so when prince naveen comes around it leads to a whole lot of things that she didn't expect.  you must kiss me.  excuse me.  please, it will make me human.  just one kiss.  unless you beg for more.   so one little tiny kissleads to one masisve adventure.  what did you do to me.   they end up going on a journey together.   it's so much fun.  i could use a little help.  oh, i will play a little louder.  where y'all going.  find someone to break this spell.  the only thing important is what's under the skin.  the princess is what you have inside.  and you can do anything that you set your mind to.   whatever it is that makes your pulse race faster.  go for it.  yeah, you know it.   well surfers, that's just a taste of new orleans and  disney's the princess and the frog  coming to theaters soon.  ha ha ha ha.  soon, the entire island will be a solid chunk of ice.  now that i have this impenetrable ice fortress, it will be simple to collect the remaining experiment pods.  well, how're you going to ddo that if they're bburied in the snow.  the pods emanate a heat signature.  that will show up only on my thermal scanner.  wwhat if somebody ttries to stop you.  there's no way anyone could even get up here to try and stop me.  don't forget your hats.  aah.  so, how are you going to defeat that little freezer burn.  burn. hmm.  that gives me an idea.  but i'm going to need your help.  whoa.    stitch: uhuh. naga. oh, no.  aah.  stitch: oh.   who would dare approach my fortress of ice.  and at this hour.  get the blasters.  i guess you could say i iced them. ha ha ha ha ha.  yeah. you iced a couple of snowmen.  let's go find slushy.   we're trapped.  you were foolish to think you could stop me.  we weren't trying to stop you.  just distract you.   huh.  hi, splody.  523, get him.  elemental evil genius experiments about to join in epic battle, and i forgot camera.  ha ha.  both: aah.  ooh.  aah.  aah. oh.  ha. he missed.  he didn't miss. just tricked you again.  yay, splodyhead.  do not be celebrating yet.  oh, no.   now, freeze them all.  choobie cheebah.  ccut it out. ouch.  that one was mine. ha ha ha.  stop. stop it.  i surrender.  we'll find you a nice home.  ..  splodyhead has to heat up the island.  got to love that hawaiian sun.  right, stitch. ee.  you just had to freeze everything.   i think i caught a cold.  i can fix you my famous chicken soup sandwich.  ooh.  luki: mahalo plenty, lilo.  your little slushy friend.  he was a real life saver.  not a problem, luki. see ya.  and thank you, stitch.  oh.  well, for giving snow a try.  i know you didn't want to try new things, but i'm glad you did.  bwah.  oh. wiwo.  ..
