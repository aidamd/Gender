" no. too familiar.  urgent matter, "safety of the world at stake.  " and send.  now all we have to do is wait for kim to arrive.  but what if stitch needs us right now.  so far, so good, you blue, pointy villaintype person, you.  ha.  are you certain this machine of yours is .  it will.  soon our guest will be replicated a thousand times over and set free to cause destruction throughout the world, mr. hamsterwheel.  not "wheel," you creepyfaced ninnyhammer.  viel.  ..the cow.  " dr. hamsterviel.  your machine better work because i didn't search out there for the evil phonebook and call you to be treated like awhat's that. huh. oh, sorry.  your signal is breaking up.  i can'tuhoh. talk to you later.  charming little lump of fur.  well, you might as well get comfortable.  i assure you, where you're going is much less pleasant.  so, do you know, like, the king of hawaii.  i mean, two booyas up for the ride, k.p.  no big.  my dad and the senator were tight in grad school.  hey. maybe we can hit him up for a luau.  "safety of world " that means there won't be time for noshing with the locals, all right.  oh.  you don't think we need to wait for kim possible, either, do you.  i didn't think so.  where are you going, lilo.  ..camping...  in the kitchen.  well, ok, but stay close.  you don't wanna miss the look on kim possible's face when she sees my collage of her.   what was that.  ow.  that's got "bruise" written all over it.  ..  ok. what's with her.  ..aunt pleakley is... topheavy.  whasha.  got you covered, k.p.  you are possible kim, no.  noi meanwell, yes. impossible kim.  why are we talking like this.  i'm sorry. your services won't be needed.  whoa. hold on a sec.  your email specifically said it was urgent.  " no. who's stitch.  no, no. what's the sitch. it's like a catchphrase.  stitch isn't a catchphrase.  he's my friend.  " move toward the door.  kick it.  look, this is stitch.  someone on a flying french roll took him, and he needs help.  um, let me get this straight.  the world's not about to be destroyed, and you need me to save your koala from an aeronautic sandwich.  stitch is an alien.  ha ha. of course. he's from australia.  626 is not koala, and is also not from down under land.  is dangerous genetic experiment.  626 possesses potential to cause unheard of destruction.  but he's better now.  hmm. kinda out there, but i've heard worse.  we're on it.  whoo. i just had the strangest dream.  someone took stitch, and kim possible came, andaah.  kimkimkim popopossible.  oh, no, you don't.  i'm sorry.  ..  the remarkable.  the ron man has that effect on the ladies.  just ignore him.  right now we've got to focus on saving snooch.  it's stitch.  and i'm going to save him alone.  so you can go now.  what a little joker. always joking.  "joking lilo" is what we call her.  actually, if we could keep her away from any danger, ..spankin'.  you got it, aunt blinky.  ..  uh, the little guy.  well, we were in the forest playing, and that's when the french roll came.  ..  jumba:  it cannot be.  pleakley.  do you see creature in pocket of spotfaced boy.  pleakley: what's the big deal.  i tell you what is big deal.  creature is not earth rat.  he's eating like experiment 607.  are you sure that's experiment 607.  of course i'm sure.  wouldn't be two such uglies in universe.  so i think we should use the xbuggy as an aircraft andlook, lilo, i really appreciate your help, but don't you have something else to do.  you know. something a little less dangerous.  well, i was making a baking man.  his name is light bulb.  he raises penguins for their milk.  eww.  notice deceptible and simple and innocentlooking design.  would never suspect tiny experiment could work.  fabric of space and time causing entire universe to collapse upon itself.   sorry.  your pink little companionis he for sale.  what, rufus. no way, man. he's my best bud.  i wouldn't part with this little dude for all the nacos in melton.  that is very heartwarming to hear.  however, i will be taking him.  haa. hey.  stop the experiment 607.  got him. eww. it's naked.  he's a naked little rat.  so he's your rescue team.  old friend, that's your aunt and uncle.  broken family.  don't worry. i'll find him.  show me the crime scene.  i'm thinking stitch was kidnapped by hamsterviel.  he's an evil space gerbil who thinks he's a hamster.  i'm telling you, if we used the xbuggyhey, i have an idea.  why don't you sit down quietly and safely while i look for clues.  ..like this.  oh, don't tell me.  there's something written on it.  it says, "if found, please return to dr.  drakken.  " wade, give me a beat on dr. d.  looks like he's about 83 miles southeast of your position.  but that's in the middle of the ocean.  we're gonna need some major air transport.  we can use the xbuggy.  thanks, but i promised your aunt i wouldn't let you get hurt.  i won't get hurt. i promise.  lilo, please.  this just isn't a kidfriendly sitch.  i'll be back in no time with snotch.  stitch.  all right.   yaah.  hah. in your face, alien.  these bars are charged with over 300,000 volts of electricity.  yeah, about that.  do you have any idea what that's gonna do to your electric bill.  chump change, compared to the fortunes we will reap once my plan comes to fruition.  it's all going on credit cards anyway.  still a little fuzzy on the plan, though.  oh. what is there to be fuzzy about.  according to that hamsterviel character, our little guest has the innate ability to destroy entire cities singlehandedly.  if we duplicate that power a thousand times overwhat is it with you and the cloning thing.  you're, like, 0 for 5.  yes. don't remind me.  well, then why do you keepbecause it's going to work this time, that's why.  and i'm in charge, and you're not.  in charge.  you're hired help for a gerbil.  hamster. and it's a limited partnership.  yeah, what's your split.  5050.  but you do all the work. that's bad business.  in my boardroom, you're fired.  why can't you be supportive like most sidekicks.  words hurt, shego.  try being helpful with your suggestions.  ok. you want a suggestion.  how about we stop that thing from escaping.  after him.  not so fast, lint ball.  kim: you sure these coordinates are right.  i don't see a ship or anything.  drakken's got to be there somewhere.  only one way to find out.  lilo, what are you doing in my parachute.  i have a problem with authority.  i promised your aunt i would keep you safe.  i am so in trouble.  aah.  lilo, you do me a colossal fave and go back to the island, ok.  but i can help.  i know why you can't find the evil lair.  it's under water.  stitch can break out of pretty much any prison.  but he can't swim 'cause his molecules are dense, and there's a wicked current out here called the peopleeater.  lilo, i've jumped out of burning planes, outskied avalanches, and looked josh mankey straight in the eye.  i think i can handle a little rushing water.  then i guess i'll just have to save you when you get in trouble.  please and thank you.  um, steer for a sec.  send the copter back.  i'm covered inhmm.  ha ha.  in a little over your head, aren't you.  because the water's over your head and you can't swim. )
