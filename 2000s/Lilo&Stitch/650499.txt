 ah.  you missed a spot.    aloha.  i'll be right there.  uh, mr. wong.  i'm telling you, there's an experiment pod on myrtle edmonds' new bracelet that she got for her birthday.  did you see number.  that's what i was trying to do when mrs. edmonds dragged me off myrtle.   oh, hello, fellow spirit beings.  i hope my chanting wasn't bothering you.  pleakley, are you all right.  hmm.  oh, incredible.  really, truly.  it's so amazing.  yes, at first, i was in excruciating pain.  but it was all part of the process.  once i transcended that, i realized that the pain was just an illusion.  you have got to be kidding me.  aah.  pain is only illusion.  heh.  what about the pod.  look, do whatever you have to do.  but whatever you do, stay out of trouble.  but, nani, you can't just leave.  you have to help us find out which experiment it is.  sorry, lilo. i can't.  it's an important day at the shop, remember.  it's always an important day at the shop.  ahh.  someday you'll understand.  i guess it's all up to us.  yeah.  now, you're going to have to go in alone, because i think they may be onto me.  i'll be hiding out here, so be sure to use your walkietalkie and tell me the number on the pod as soon as you see it, ok.  ok.  look at that one. it's blue.   he likes me.  aww.  stitch: experiment 606.  606.  ..  oh, no.  stitch.  come in, stitch.  experiment 606 is a black hole that will suck in the whole world.  we have to call jumba toofficer kehiko: how's it, lilo.  officer kehiko.  what are you doing here.  what i'm doing here is you're in my car.  oh.  are you taking me to the station.  yup.  and then i'm gonna call your sister to come get you.  ok.  but i think it's only fair to warn you i will definitely try to escape.  you should probably put on the siren.  mmhmm.  buckle up, please.  don't think these bonds can hold me.  i know my rights.  i demand a lawyer.  lilo, you're not under arrest.  come out of there before someone sees you.  not until i get my one phone call.  i already called nani.  she's busy working, and she'll be here as soon as she can.  she's always busy working.  don't be like that, lilo.  she's only doing it for you.  now, you want something to eat.  do i get a serving of gruel, or do i have to eat rats.  how about some kulolo.  i made it myself.  hmm.  i will need to be well nourished when i become a fugitive from the law.  bring me a bowl, and can you put some coconut sprinkles on top.  i'll see what i can do.  lilo.  ..   here.  did you call jumba and tell him about the experiment.  eh.  now we just have to find out where myrtle went.  i warned him i'd escape.  should've listened.  here you go.  ..  kles.  so far, everything's in order.  ohh, we try very hard to maintain wonder sea rentals' high standards.  that's what we like to hear.  you see, we like to think of wonder sea rentals as a family.    phone technique is an essential part of the wonder sea way.  go ahead and answer it with verve.  aloha.  .  oh. ok.  problem.  no. no problem at all.  you were saying ..  family.  myrtle: excuse me. i'd like to rent a board.  oh.  the sacred jewel of all business: the customer.  let's get a peek at your people skills.  pretend i'm not here and don't forget the verve.  why, hello, myrtle.  what kind of board would you like.  blue.  uhh. you can't surf.  you'll get the pod wet. lilo.  and the black hole will suck in the whole world.  lilo, get off her.  nani, what is your sister doing.  that's her sister. hmm.  you promised not to cause trouble this week.  stitch.  do something.  uhh. aah.  aah.   myrtle: hey. give that back.  oh, no.   give that bracelet back.  agataba.  oh, no you don't.   agataba.  uhoh.  so much verve all over the place today.  aah.  there's my bracelet.  don't get it wet.  it'll destroy everything.  hmm.      whoa.   oh, boy, oh, boy.  this time, he's gonna can me for sure.  i mean, i would can me, and i really wanted that raise.  what good is a raise if the whole world gets sucked in by a black hole.  please stay and help us.  sorry, lilo. i can't.  wong and beg for his mercy.   hello.  myrtle: there's something eating my room.  myrtle.  you got to come over here and fix this, 'cause this freaky stuff is always your fault.  hang on to something.  we'll be right there.   do you mind.  i'm trying to become one with the universe.  and i am trying to become one with pastrami sandwich.  myrtle edmonds activated experiment 606.  wowwhee. i was hoping she would try.  now it's gonna suck the whole universe into a big black hole.  did you say "black hole".  yup.  there's no escape from an astronomical event like that.  to think, the universe is ending, and all i was worried about was eternal wisdom.  if this is my last day on earth, i'm eating pastrami.  not to worry.  after 626 called to warn me about experiment, i developed solution to black hole problem: antiantimattersphere.  if collides with galactic matter deep inside hole, will collapse it.  but someone must to fly inside.  we'll handle this, right, stitch.  uhh.  can we stop for baby back ribs on the way.  jumba: whoa.  is black hole all right.  ..  barbecue tasty.  myrtle: you have to do something quick ..    let's rockahula.  ok.  stitch: yeehaw.  jumba, can you read me.  jumba: reading you, little girl.  we are inside the hole.   mr. wong.  oh. it's you.  i am so sorry, mr. wong.  did the representative leave.  he's gone.  and we didn't pass inspection.  oh, we passed, but only if we pay.  they want a lot of money to stay in their family.  i said, "keep your family.  "i got my own, " mr. wong, i have to go.  i promise i'll be back, and i'll even bring a hammer to fix this place.  but right now, i need to be with my family.  jumba: now, must fire sphere in exactly 5 seconds to give you time to exit hole.  5, 4, 3, 2, 1.   not good.  oh, no. the launcher's not firing.  now what do we do.  aha.  i gotcha.  go deep.  hut, hut, hut, hike.  uhh.  i think you did it.  now you must hang a uey before it takes effect.  roger that.  turn her around and let's go home.   little girl and 626 have successfully launched antiantimattersphere to collapse black hole.  you mean, they're inside.  yes, but they must to get out soon or be trapped forever.  lilo: come in, jumba. there's something wrong.  we can't get out.  we just lost the roof.  losing speed.  oh, no.  gravitational pull is too strong.  body's breaking up.   lilo.  nani.  what are you doing here.   i took the rest of the day off.  ..  aah. aah. aah.  .   .  aah.  aah.  lilo, i promise.  work will never get in the way when you need me.  ok.  and i promise never to become a fugitive from justice again.  i think it's gonna be better than before.  with my architectural expertise, new shack will be phenomenal.   and, thanks to 606, no leftover debris.  you'll be happy to know that i'm completely rehabilitated.  no more life of crime for me.  that's wonderful, lilo.  you want a mahi burger.  i do. i do.  and a thick, juicy steak.  and spicy buffalo wings.  and an ostrich filet.  and alligator casserole.  oh, and if you got any baconwrapped asparagus, i suppose i could eat 10 or 20 of those.

miles of open ocean alone.  but i'll have stitch with me.  stitch sinks. remember.  then why don't you come.  i told david i'd help him at the resort luau, setting tables and lighting tiki torches.  but this is an epic showdown.  you see, although i believe all creatures have good in them, stitch thinks gantu is pure evil.  so he really wants to get this experiment pod we're after.  uhhuh.  no, stitch, wait.  unnhh. argh.  ba babah.   all right.  you can go, but house rules apply.  take jumba and pleakley and be home for dinner.  and good luck with your big torchlighting gig.  and good luck

626 is no dogooder.  he's a trog, an abomination.  pure, unmitigated evil.  why don't you tell us how you really feel, blubber buns.  good always triumphs over evil, and i am good, very good, therefore i will get that experiment.  i'll believe it when i see a pod in your flipper.  until then, i'll be here, kickin' it with my sandwich pals.  that reminds me: i haven't packed any food.  you and your pals will accompany me today.  note to self: only open mouth to insert sandwiches.  why is small, isolated land mass called "forbidden island".  it's probably got some kind of ancient evil
