family meansi know. i know.  no one gets left behind.  ok, stitch.  come, little girl.  we must find way to get to door.  this is your dream.  concentrate.   pleakley: dental floss.  i was trying for a rope.  even teensy plaqueeradicating string may prove to be lifesaving, too.  wow, you're good.  if there's ever an orthodontic rodeo, remind me to sign you up.  whoa. whoo.  prepare, everybody.  we're almost at door.  oh.  aah.  pleakley, hold on.  are you ok.  i saw my whole life flash before my eye.  i really should've been more outgoing in high school.  ikata.  hey, what's wrong with you.  did another pigeon get into your pantry.  no. it's lilo.  she's in a bad mood.  today is a very sad day for both of us.  you know what i do when i'm in the dumps.  no. what.  well, first i eat an entire roast chicken.  then i remember the words to an old song my mother used to sing to me when i was little.  ahem.   when storm clouds grow    and i feel blue    your song comes drifting on the trade winds   i know that song.  our mother used to sing that to us, too.  thank you, mrs. hasagawa.  good.  now, remember to stay happy, because you know what they say about happiness.  it's like peruvian monkey flu.  very contagious.   hmm.  oh, no. i have to go wake up lilo.  if i don't, she'll be up all night.  ok, and don't forget the song.  i won't.  hey.  this isn't what usually happens in this dream.  a school.  aloha, lilo.  hi, lilo.  aloha, lilo.  this is definitely not what usually happens.  lilo, your hair is so pretty.  just like your mother's hair.  and you're not weird, not even a little bit.  you just have a quirky personality, on account of the hard life you've had.  really.  yes. you're just misunderstood.  and i'm here for you, lilo, whenever you need me.  hey, jumba, this dream's getting weirder by theoh. oh.  look. it's me. hi, me.  and i'm graceful.   everybody conga    everybody conga   pleakley: my dream self has rhythm.  pika laku.  sasa. ha ha ha.  lilo, your dream, it is remarkable.  flying dream jumba looks so good in tuxedo.  has wonderful slimming effect. heh heh.  dream self must learn to drive dream invention, however.  earth child with the pretty hair. greetings.  huh.  ok, who's got the grumbellies.  this can't be happening.  i've never had a dream that was so cool.  whee.  this is the best, lilo.  yeah, i elect lilo the honorary president of the universe.  all: yeah.  dream jumba reminds me.  flying gizmo almost caused me to lose focus there for moment.  now, lilo, we must keep sharp eye out for 276.  aw, can't we just have a little more fun.  after all, i am president of the universe now.  actually, that would be bad idea.  276 was designed to attack at peak of subconscious enjoyment.  .  this is so much fun.  no one's even called me weird.  and look.  all the experiments are totally behaving.  dream pleakley:  lala, lala, lala    lala, lala, lala   jumba: all behaving except 276.   lala, lala, la  aah.  oh.  aah. eels. eels.  so slithery, slimy.    huh, huhhuh, huhhuhhuh, huhhuh   what a surprise.  you ruined everything.  you're so predictable.  and weird.  you can't even dream right.  yeah. yeah.  nani: lilo, wake up.   oh, no.  pleakley, you must quickly insomnambulaport out of dream and stop larger girl from waking lilo.  well, you insist.   lilo    lilo   stop.  ..   stop.  do not wake lilo.  what are you, lolo.  sneaking up on me likehat.  jumba.  what's happening.  pleakley's too late.  ..  forever.  newdisney playlist from the recording studio with some of the disney channelstars you'll hear on the 15songdisney mania 7cd, out now.  . some people settle for the typical thing .  . i want to be where the people are .  so fromdisney mania 7, you're gonna get a whole variety of songs.  you're gonna get love songs.  you're gonna get rock songs.  you're gonna get songs like mine, which are, you know, upbeat and dancey.  it feels awesome to have a song on thedisney mania 7album.  it's my firstdisney mania album song ever, so i'm really excited.  . wish i could i be part of that world .  i absolutely love the little mermaid.  i was very much inspired by ariel, her beautiful voice and her ambition.  and i figured out how she would sound today and kind of brought that to my recorded version.  and i nted it to be completely opposite from the original, so why not turn it into a highenergized dance remix.  . stand out .  .. .  so i picked the song stand out, which is from thegoofy movie, you know, one of my favorite disney movies of all time.  it was already an awesome s and i figured we could just up the beat a little bit more and make it a little bit faster tempo and add a little bit more dance to it.  . till mine is the only face that you see .  .. .  i'm stoked to be ondisney mania 7.  there's honor society, tiffany thornton, demi lovato, alyson stoner, ksma bunch of really, really cool people.  thedisney mania 7cd is out now.  and that's what's on your disney music playlist on disney channel.  what's gotten into you, pleakley.  have you been sniffing the horseradish again.  i'm supposed to stop you.  jumba and stitch are after a dreamintruding experiment, and if lilo wakes up, they'll be trapped inside her dream forever.  what.  i can't leave you four alone for a minute, cai.  sleep, lilo.  sleep.  for the love of all that is good and decent, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep.  it's not working.  of course it's not working.  you sound like a broken sprinkler.  wait a minute. i know a song that might work.   when storm clouds grow    and i feel blue    your song comes drifting on the trade winds    your bright smile shines    like sun on sand    an island dream of you   i know that song.  pleakley: it worked.  lullaby seems to be working, but troubles are not over yet. look.   oh, no.  ha ha ha.  follow me.   where do you think you're going, weirdlo.  girls: yeah.  hee hee hee.  hee hee hee.  nani: look at her.  they must still be in trouble.  lilo's dreams have become nightmares.  volcanoes and storms and bickering zombies.  she's just miserable.  storms.  an island dream of you.  pleakley, that's it.  you have to go back in.  are you kidding.  it's full of dark, slippery hallways and flying clocks and bickering zombies.  and, oh, yes, a little thing called danger.  you have to take this picture to lilo.  it's the only way.  but what about the danger.  this picture makes her happy.  it might help her remember the happy times, instead of filling her head with sadness.  then, maybe she'll be able to turn her own nightmare back into a dream.  did i mention the danger.  i think i did at least twice now.  please, it's up to you.  i have to stay here and sing to her again if she starts to wake up.  ok. ok.  sheesh.   aah.  ok, bad decision.  aah.  pleakley, you came back.  unfortunately, it looks as though capture of 276 is lost cause.  we are about to be digested by big little girl monsters.  yes, i've got the picture.  wait a minute. that's right.  i've got the picture.  my picture.  hey. ha ha.  quit it. ha ha ha.  nani, help.  gantu: you thought you'd escape that easily, did you.  well, think again, trogs.  huh.  ha ha ha.  ha ha ha.  aha.  ha. got you, you little nightmare.  lilo.  no, no, no, no.  leave her to dream, 626.  she is in peaceful place.  how is she doing.  i think she'll be ok.   what's everybody doing here.  oh, nothing.  we just dropped by to watch you sleep.  nani, i had the best dream ever.  ..  well, i'll tell you about it later.  right now, i'm hungry.  will you make me another sandwich.  i promise to eat it this time.  sure, lilo. anything you say.  extra anchovies, please.  are you sure this is a good idea.  of course.  i have reprogrammed 276 to be completely harmless.  now, rather than invading dreams, 276 can take children on fantastic journeys without causing nightmares.  there you go.  knock self out.  whoa.  maybe it needs to be tuned down a bit.  i think it's time a certain blue genetic experiment tickled a certain little girl.  oh, no, you don't.  ..  nani, help.  ha ha ha. jimito.   captioning made possible byabc cable networks group captioning performed bythe
