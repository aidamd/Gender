" ooh. uhh.    stitch, you're hurting him.   help.  uhh. unh.  you had him, all right.  tying up his arms like a pretzel.  it was hurting him, you big bully.  noogis sha.  it was not my fault.  noogis sha.  was not.  was not. noogis sha.    atat , what a aame. whate.e.e. ] ] hut. hut. hut.   oh, what a gam mi  what am g aatwh  experiments identified.  here is 411 on 501 and 502.  500 series all elementals.  designed forhow you saydistraction.  502 is lava spoutervery dangerous.  same for 501big shpritzer.  make you soggy in big hurry.  hello. he's toast, and i'm soaked.  we know all that.  there is more jumba must inform little girl and 626.  is very important 501 and 502 do not come in contact.  why.  if they were to touch, could be cataclysmic disaster of epic proportions.  why.  because of massive release of quantum energy.  501 plus 502 equal one big boom.  what is it with you and the big booms and the evil and the destruction.  why didn't you create any experiments to do something constructive, like, say, oh, i don't know, ironing.  i am genius only, not miracle worker. heh heh.  i would've caught that 501 if koala head hadn't stopped me.  fava no poogy.  626 is not agreeing.  in fact, he is saying he would've captured 501, but you were throwing monkey tool in works.  that is so not true.  i can totally capture an experiment without you.  dubba da.  meego dogga. ungasa. woojo naga dogga.  again 626 denies all your words.  he says he can catch experiment without you.  get it.  you're on.  fee boogoo.  oh, ho.  626 accepts little girl's challenge.  of course, genetically superior 626 will easily catch his target before little girl. ha.  pshaw. he's nothing without lilo.  she has earth brains, earth instincts.  he's just a monster.  perhaps willing to make a wager.  i am dying to, but galactic wagering rules require stakes.  ha ha. stakes are best part.  let's see. ha.  loser of bet must perform dreaded glocknar ceremonial dance.   the funky glocknar.  the witless dance of a thousand hours.  ha ha.  is one eye scared like bock bock earth fowl which crosses road.  not this one eye, senor four eyes.  hey, experiment tracks.  come to papa. ha ha ha ha ha ha.   oh, this is too easy.  there, now.  you just get comfortable while iif i had a little help, this sort of thing wouldn't happen.   625.  you worthless twerp.  huh. what. ohh. oh, gantu.  ..  for a place to dig a trap.  i knew you'd goof off if i left you alone.  you're coming with me.  if you need me to come bail you out, i suppose i can do it.  nobody bails me out. i do my own bailing.  and don't let me catch you goofing off again.  hey, hey, hey.  you didn't even notice my sandwich trap.  that took me, like, one minute to set up.  i am so underappreciated.   626 must prepare.  competition not to take lightly.  for catching lava experiment, we have lazy oven mitts.  except i can't remember why i call them lazy.  ha. not lazy, laser.  now i'm remembering, use all my brains.  as a competent experiment catcher is a wellprepared experiment catcher, i've broken into my personal collection of state of the art earth antiwater technology.  prepare for armament.  pressurized buoyancy hoop.  check.  antiwater eye shield.  check.  subsurface breathing apparati.  check.  webbed appendage locomotive aids.  check.  and this is laser shield.  ooh.  ha. cha.   mmm.  waah. ooh.  laser shield not for snacking.   water eliminator squares.  lilo: ok.  absorbency sheets.  right.  manual dryness promoter.  got it.  we don't want to get our hair wet.  hmm.  don't worry this time. not laser.  blaster is loaded with antiheat foam.  ow.  whoa. ohh.  again, my mistaking.  heh heh. ok.  now is loaded with antiheat foam. heh heh.  one shot, all lava is stopped.  oh.  oy.  and you absolutely must have this expanding h2o shield array.  check.  to quote the exciting actionadventure genre of earth entertainment, you are ready to rock and roll.  uh, lilo.  lilo.  oh, no. i've buried her alive.  why, oh, why didn't i stop.  hang on. i'm coming.  somebody dial those 3 numbers.  she's been smushed to atoms, and it's all my fault.  what are you doing.   nothing.  may the best hunter win. heh heh heh.  of course, i mean huntress.  in your sleep time delusions, buddy.  ha ha ha ha.  there it is. i see it.  it's fascinating. do you see it.  it's right there. i can't believe i see it.  you see it, right.  lilo: shh.   i'll take that as a yes.    626.  little girl is about to win bet.  i mean challenge.  they're closing in. hurry.   yaah. waah.  stitch: ooh.  aah. aah.  aah. ohh.   well, if this isn't just peachy.  is about to get more peach like.  lava and water experiments have seen each other.  world can only hope experiments go separate ways.  eh, so much for hope.  at least we have good seat for big disaster.   when they make contact is going to be disaster of endworlding size.  i can't look.  i mean, i can. i just don't want to.  lilo: we got dibson those, big dummy.  they're ours.now go away.  i don't see your name on them anywhere, which means i win.  as you earth forms say, aloha.   i guess this means the bet's off.   ohh. 626 designed to never quit.  yeah. well, me, neither.  come on, pleakley.  let's find gantu and give him a wedgie.  but he's so wellarmed.  and then there's the whole boxers or briefs question.  aah.  nugasa no fini.  jumba: yes, 626, is true.  little girl may be cute and family, but in this contest, we must crush her like bun.  626 has super speed.  flip you on the seaside, my oneeyed, soon to be glocknar dancing friend.  ha ha ha ha ha ha. byebye.  if stitch wins, i'll be doing the dreaded glocknar o their domiciles.  don't worry. i know a shortcut.  oh.   pleakley: wait up. oh.  ha. double bounty.  what shall i buy.  hmm. some earth form dropped a sandwich.  egg salad.  hey.   oh, great.  all right, i got you, mistergantu.      did you hear that.  both experiments have escaped again, thanks to you.  ohh. oh, no.  oh, that is so pathetic, that you have to blame me for your screw up.  if we had worked together in the first place like i said, we wouldn't be in this mess.  the big dummy is right, stitch.  eh.  maybe if we work togethernever mind making up.  first be finding 501 and 502 and making certain they do not make with the touching or tapping or patting.  why do you keep saying that.  if i'm telling once, i'm telling more than once.  lava genius experiment and water genius experiment must not touch.  well, wait a minute.  that's not what david said.  and what does local surfer boy know of this.  maybe it was what he was trying to tell us about yin and yang.  2 very different things come together to make one good thing.  like peanut butter and jelly or doughnuts and mustard.  stitch and lilo.  yeah.   ohh. little girl is right.  lava and water together is explosive, yes, but good is making land.  huh. missed that one.  am having off day for geniusing.  come on, partner.  goo badga.  cute little girl once again reunited with hideous monster of destruction.   so beautiful.   is our bet still on.  you better believe it, one eye.    unh.    oh.  ha ha. lilo's clever plan worked.  i win.  it was 626's strength and agility that caught experiment.  i am winning.  nope.  we caught him at the same exact time together.  right, stitch.  uhh. uhh.  which means we tied.  yeahoh. no. is not good.  intergalactic wagering rules state, in the event of a tie, both parties must pay the bet.   we both lose.   pleakley: oh, ha ha.  hee hee heh heh ha ha ha.  whoo.  hee hee hee.   dance that funky glocknar, four eyes    you're dancing witless glocknar, too    both:  we're glocking for a thousand hours    stick out your glocknar    and shake it till you're glockaglocka through   hee hee. like glue.  hee hee heh heh ha ha ha.  ooh, fascinating.   ok, i'm cramping up.  keep dancing.  999 hours and 42 minutes left.  now it's time for you guys to learn about yin and yang.   yin and yang.  i totally forgot about david.  so, lilo, what does this have to do with yin and yang.  it's when 2 opposite things come together to make one thing.  right. watch this.   wow. they're making a whole new island.  now, that is yin and yang.  and stitch and i are yin and yang, toobrains and brawn, earth girl and alien, combining to make one kickbutt experimentcatching team.  uhh.  do you think mummies and werewolves could work together to make one really scary monster.  nah. mummies kick all over werewolves.  wanna bet. loser does the glocknar.  ok.  what's the glocknar.  tookie bah waba.

man. the iceis already melting.  i'll stilltake a soda.         look out. earthquake.  ha ha ha ha.  geologists are still looking into the unusual quake centered at lihue beach that rocked the island this morning.  gantu: 625, turn that thing off.  i'm trying to get this communication relay back online, and you're not helping.  aww, what's the matter.  can't handle plugging in wires by yourself.  at least i'll be ready in case of a sandwich shortage.  shortage.   boop boop be boop   newsflash from the crab nebula, space whale.  there was a quake today.  i'm not taking chances. i'm stocking up.  you landlocked cetacean, why have you not reported.  i hate my life.  hamsterviel, the communication relay was down.  i pay you for results, and all you do is disappoint.  if you do not bring me an experiment soon, i will abuse you physically as well as verbally.  understood, sir.  computer: experiment 513 activated.  primary functiongeological disruption.  ahh, a quakemaking experiment.  excellent. bring it to me at once.     i've called you all together for an emergency earthquake readiness meeting.  now, planetary shaking is measured on what " today's quake was a 5.0.  quite moderate and perfectly normal, but a good reminder to us allbe prepared and don't panic.  repeatdo not panic.  i'm thinking you are panicking.  me. of course not.  this planet is composed of a system of geologic faults and plates that are all in constant flux, which can lead to mass destruction.   we should all be panicking.  waah. the sky is falling. the sky is falling.  duck and thanks.  a faceful of cold bonded hydrogen and oxygen always calms my nerves.  now, where was i.  you were telling us not to panic when you started panicking.  oh, right. ha ha ha. right.  i just want to make sure we're all prepared.  that's why i put together these special earthquake kits.  my research shows that these kits contain all the items one needs in case of a quake.  ..dehydrated protein supplements, rehydration container, handheld incandescent illuminator, )
