 what do you want, weirdlo.  oh, not much. just a good laugh.  do your thing, heckler.  wow. i don't know where to start.  is the clown still chasing you.  what clown.  the one you stole that fright wig you call hair from.  and those glasses.  you're going for a career in welding.  both: ha ha.  you call this home.  if you look up shanty in the dictionary, there's a picture of this place.  i've seen nicer cardboard boxes on skid row.  back off, stitch. he's right.  our house is kind of a dump.  i know that you're donating the tables out of the kindness of your heart, but we expect a large turnout, and we need more than 2.  so if you couldhello.  uhh.  somebody needs to be introduced to a little concept called anger management.  oh, great. what's this one.  unless it's a charity event organizer experiment, i don't think i'm in the mood.  nani, this is heckler.  heckler, this is nani.  how do you do, hippo hips.  what did he say.  ha ha.  that's a good one, heckler.  and why are you laughing.  it's funny because it's true.  you do have hippo hips.  .  did i just hear what i'm thinking.  experiment 322, is that you.  you look good.  so do you, if by "good" you mean bald, foureyed, and ugly.  ha ha ha.  yes, that's 322, all right.  the program to destroy enemy's selfconfidence by mercilessly taunting and humiliating himone of the best ideas i've ever had.  more like only idea you've ever had, which explains why you're living on this podunk planet with these losers.   get rid of that thing now.  but he's funny.   you taste like old sock.  ohh. naga toto.  lilo, making fun of people's shortcomings not only isn't funny, it isn't nice.  you just don't have a sense of humor.  look, i don't have time to argue about this now.  you keep that thing out of my sight until after the event.  got it.  about those 2 tables, i was thinking about it, and they're just the perfect size for my event.  where's pleakley.  outside practicing uncomedy routine.  and you, sir, where are you from.  oh, washington. really.  the state, the city, or the dead president.  hee hee. dead president.  where'd this guylearn comedy.  a funeral parlor.  'cause he's gonnadie out there.  can you help him.  there's only one thingi can think of that'll make this guy'sstandup fun to watch.  tomatoes.  adaba.  ever since the first looser slipped on a banana peel, comedy's been all about laughing at other people's expense, right.  i guess.  so if a guy's jokes aren't funny, you can at least get a yuk or two out of throwing tomatoes at him.  i don't know.  these are pretty big. they could hurt.  that's why you use the rotten ones, genius.  ..you're the comedy expert.  plate, flatware, rotten tomato.  plate, flatware, rotten tomato.  pocheefa.  lilo, what are you doing.  don't worry, nani.  everything's perfectly under control, thanks to heckler.   i quit.  leilani, wait. i don't understand.  what happened.  i've been trying to lose weight, but this apron makes me look like a big, fat penguin.  . says who.  i'm quitting, too.  this hat does make me look like a dweeb.  man, these people are too easy.  talk about low selfesteem.  who's next. i'm on a roll.  lilo.  i spent 3 days trying to pull together a crew for this, and your experiment is insulting them right out the door.  but he makes me laugh.  not hard to do, small fry.  u're gigglier than 2 packs of laughing hyenas.  hey.  but giggling beats that whine of yours.  "stiiitch." ouch.  fingernails meet blackboard.  blackboard, fingernails.  oh, and mrs. hasegawa called.  she wants that potato you're using for a nose back.  that's not funny.  it's only funny when it's the other guy.  well, it's been real, but i gotta run.  get him, stitch.  finally.   all right, earth forms, hand over the trog.  perfect. you know what.  you want him. take him.  nani, no.  he'sohana.  we have to find his one true place.  we can't justheckler: again with theohana and the one true place.  i see you've read the dictionary of 2 phrases cover to cover.  take him.  gladly.  you two deserve each other.  stitch, fix the door so i can slam it on them.   and for the record, my nose does not look like a potato.   mayor of looserville, indeed.  mayor of looserville.  ha ha. that's a good one.  hamsterviel, i've finally caught an experiment.  it insults people.  .  i am perfectly capable of insulting people in my own genius fashion, you rubberheaded rubber fish thing.  rubberheaded rubber fish.  you call that a genius insult.  i've seen better digs in my vegetable garden.  . what do you know about insults, ..marking.  what's the "h" stand for.  " you're overly talking, overtalker.  well, i could see you've been working on the accent.  i almost understood a word you said just now.   oh, nice comeback.  youyou.   iii'm wondering what are you anyway.  the name says hamster, but the tail's all poodle.  gantu.  i do not like this unlikable experiment.  set him free. set him free.  but i finallygo ahead, you sloppy impersonator of a slob.   yes, sir.  ha ha.  hate to insult and leave.  actually, i love it.  ah, too bad.  i could use some insult backup around here.  mayor, what's your next decree to the people of looserville.  grr.  i just flew in from maui.  ijustflew in from maui.  i just flewinfrom maui.  does my nose really look like a potato.  you can tell me if it does.  no, of course not.  well, maybe a little.  but who says that's a bad thing.  look, can we talk about this later.  it's almost time for me to meet my soontobe adoring public.  are you sure you want to do this.  people could make fun of you, and it's no fun, trust me.  oh, come on.  if names are the worst thing they throw at me, i'll be fine.  the tomatoes.  nani: aloha, everyone.  i'd like to thank you all for coming out and supporting this great charity.  and now, the comedy stylings of p.l. eakley.  that's my cue.  pleakley, wait.  good evening, ladies and germs, i just flew in from maui, and, boy, are my arms tired.   what are crickets doing here.  they say that charity begins at home.  so what are y'all doing here. go home.   ahem.  pleakley's dying out there.  so what's the deal with coconuts.  they're not made of cocoa and they're not nuts, and what about pineapple.  neither pie nor apple.  this language is crazy.   hi. is this thing working.  i know i am.  so, anyone here from out of town.  i am.  lilo: oh, no. heckler's back.  he's gonna rip pleakley to shreds.  we have to do something before everyone starts pelting him with rotten tomatoes.  and where are you from, sir.  ahh.  ha ha. excuse me.  oh, boy, that is an ugly tie.  whoa. pardon me.  yeah, you. get out of the way.  pardon me. excuse me. pardon me.  whoops. sorry. comin' through.   ugh.  stitch, you're making a huge mess.  eww.  ohh.  pay no attention to the disturbance in the audience, folks.   ha ha ha.  whoops.  hey.  ha ha.   so a horse walks into a bar and the bartender saysha ha ha.  lilo's right.  who am i kidding. i'm not funny.  i'll say.  you're so not funny thatthe only thing funny about me is my looks.  what's up with this hair.   or should i say lack of hair.  i mean, my scalp's so shiny that when i go to the beach, the glint makes the seagulls crash.  but wait, that's my line.  and have you ever seen a bigger eye.  why, the other day i started crying, there was a flash flood.  well..  a potato.  you already tried that one.  and you know what.  you're right. it kind of does.   and does this stupid apron make me look like a penguin or what.  my ears are so big, every time i go to the zoo, the elephants follow me home.  my rear's so big, i once hipchecked a guy all the way to oahu.  but iyoui got nothing.   try the veal and don't forget to tip the waitresses.   pleakley, you did it.  that was so funny.  you out heckled heckler.  we all did.  i almost forgot the first rule of standup comedy: sticks and stones may break your bones, but names will never hurt you, unless they're carved in stone and thrown at you.  that's a pretty good rule for life, too.  is that what you were trying to tell me, nani.  something like that.  being mean isn't funny.  it just gets people mad at you.  i guess heckler's going to have to learn that.   i'm all alone in the world.  you're not alone in the world.  all we have to do now is find the one true place where you belong, somewhere where people expect to get heckled.  hello.  finally, jumba has arrived with his contribution to larger girl's charity.  of course, i've figured out a way to add a little evil to it. ha ha.  well, this works out nicely.   you call that a pitch.  you throw like a little girl.  iama little girl, and i'm only here 'cause lilo called me and told me how to get back at you, freak.  at least i finally got myrtle to come to the charity dinner.  sorry i made fun of your hippo hips.  no problem.  i love my hips, potato nose.   captioning made possible byabc cable networks group captioning performed bythe national captioning institute,
