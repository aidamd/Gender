 . ha ha ha.  crazy idea.  so crazy it just might work, right.  uh, no. just crazy.  lilo, what's going on here.  i told you.  there's an asteroid heading towards earth.  we were going to evacuate everyone, but i think we'll go on a secret mission to destroy the asteroid instead.  lilo, there hasn't been anything on the news about this.  anyone who'd believe you would have to be completely lolo.  yo, dudes. hey, sorry i'm late.  just stopped for a pepperoni slice.  see. it's true. ask cobra bubbles.  he knows.  ok. i'll call him.  nobody makes one single move until i get back.  let's go.  please pay attention to the inflight safety demonstration.  ..bbll...bblll.  everyone's in their upright and locked position.  perfect. launch sequence entered.  check.  coordinates locked. check.  bladder evacuated.  check.  then we are ready to rocket.    or maybe not so ready.  instead, maybe we are doomed.  it appears we are having slight problem with the power.  what's the problem.  we have none.  battery is kaput.  you didn't recharge the battery.  lilo.  ha ha ha.  zon zitsagal.  zos, zos.  sparky.  i bet he can power the ship.  jumba: it's worth a shooting.  ok, start 'er up when i say go.  oohwaahh.   aaaahhh. whoop.  oh.  lilo.   cobra. i was just trying to call.  i have to be brief, nani.  i don't quite know how to say this.  since you have access to a spaceship, i thought i should warn youoh, no. don't tell me.  an asteroid.  how did you know.  she was telling the truth.  lilo just went off in jumba and pleakley's spaceship to try to knock it down.  .  i need to get to a communications uplink.  rarrrhhh.  they seem a little restless.  you said there'd be peanuts.  we need peanuts.  and sodas.  and swizzle sticks.  i'm not going anywhere near those little monsters.  you go.  but i'm too little to fit into the stewardess outfit.  soda.  peanuts.  don't be grabby.  there's enough for everyone.  pahh.  computer voice:..  cobra's voice: cobra bubbles.  cobra.  lilo, i understand what you're trying to do.  that's good, because we're kind of making it up as we go along.  you must be exceedingly careful.  cobra: even if you do succeed in breaking up the asteroid, your ship would almost certainly be destroyed by the debris.  jumba: look. well, that is that.  i'll call ahead to kweltekwan.  they will sure to be preparing a nice welcome for us.  perhaps a parade. ho ho.  hold your horsepower, mister.  who says we have to go to your home planet.  who says we're going anywhere.  evil genius scientist says so, and evil genius scientist is driving.  wow. he is evil.  sharing a bunk bed, i tend to forget that.  lilo: jumba, no.  we can't give up.  we are going to kweltekwan, and no one or anything else is stopping me.  aah.  626, stopping, please. can't see.  lilo: stitch, look out.  the asteroid.  ..  dahh.  whoops.  oh, great.  your little monster hogtie move destroyed the navigation relay.  where are you going.  nice flying, stitch.  yeah. ha ha ha ha ha.  jumba, you've got some 'splainin' to do.  what is to 'splaining.  if ridiculous adopted home planet is chewing of food, and backward science is to be destroyed, i'm having nowhere else to go.  but you can't go back to kweltekwan.  you were banished for evil geniusing.  you'd be apprehended the second you set foot on it.  good point.  but even evil geniuses can becoming homesick.  earth is your home.  you have a family there.  an ohana.  with me and nani and pleakley and stitch.  that's why we have to try and save it.  we have to destroy that asteroid.  maybe is little girl who is genius, after all.  okeydokey.  untie me, for to help save earth.  initiating procedure for asteroid landing and the inevitable crushing of our ship by asteroid debris that's sure to follow.  you sure you don't need any help.  lilo: someone's gotta watch the experiment.  thirsty.  sit down.  the captain has not turned off the seatbelt sign.  everyone, back in your seats now.  hammerhead, quit bonking kix.  sparky, don't you touch a thing.  aah.  you two go north, i'll go south.  we need nice soft rock to dig into.  but i hate soft rock.  less talking, more rock looking.  booja.  burdak. burdak.  once we blow up the asteroid and save the earth, i bet the government will give us a plaque.  shh.  what is it.  kelta. yoshi.  i don't see anything.  yargaah.  aah.  a ghost.  naga chuga.  yaya. yaya.   chuga sevah.     uhoh. ooh.  in my opinion, that's gotta hurt even stitch.  aah.  ow. uhhh.  little girl, slow down.  what is the fire.  heh heh.  hello.  we come in peace to blow up your home.  stitch: aaahhh. ooh.  ..ooh...ouch...  what do you mean by this, scaring defenseless little girl in deadly genetic experiment.   what's he saying.  is ancient dialect.  doesn't matter.  just silly asteroid squatter.  go on, beat it.  come. i have found place to dig.  let's get to it.  we can't blow up this asteroid.  excusing me.  what is your idea.  this is that crabby guy's home, and he loves it.  just like we love the earth.  we can't destroy it.  can't destroy earth. can't destroy asteroid.  waaiaiaiait.  hah. i am more genius.  i am having a theory.  if jumba designed hyperdrive could move ship millions of miles to kweltekwan, it can perhaps move asteroid off course, miss earth.  .. we can save earth and the asteroid.  way to go, jumba.  you're hardly evil at all.  ..if we put the hyperdrive on the asteroid, we won't be able to cross the vast distances involved in interstellar travel.  you and i might never be able to return to our home planets.  we have home planet, with little girl, and bigger girl.  on earth.  ok.  you got me.  ya big jerk.  lilo: we're gonna put stitch's cousins to work.  innahousa. in. in. in.  you think it will work.  jumba: of course.  i designed experiment 383 to hypnotize entire army into submission.  surely it can subdue simpleminded asteroid squatter.  he shall be under for at least 20 minutes.  we have plenty of time tocomputer voice: entering earth atmosphere ..  4 minutes.  .  .  if this thing hits the earth's atmosphere, we're talkin' level 12 collision.  no survivors.  stitch, get the hyperdrive.  jumba, get digger digging.  come on, people, let's move.   ah.    booya.  unh.   let's hope hyperdrive has enough power to move asteroid.  hope.  i said it was theory only.  ..  i can't stand the suspense.  jumba:..  now.  yaya. yayaya.  lilo: it's working.  yahoo.   mmmmmmmmm.  did we live.  i speak not only for myself, but for everyone on earth when i say, thank you for saving our collective posterior.  ..  where's the plaque.  the commendation from the president.  the key to the earth.  the government prefers to take the stance that the threat of annihilation never actually existed.  but i did manage to swing this.  "this document officially states "that lilo and stitch "are honorary agents "in the earth defense agency, under 12 and illegal genetic experiment " cool.  i bet not even alva's got one of these.  wow. rrrrr. i should be going.  where are you going to.  i make the dinner.  nani: you cooked.  of course.  i'm cooking big, chewing, swallowing meal for my earth family.  we are to breaking bread together, yes.  ukata.  magarah.  suya.  stitch.  it's just an expression.  oh.   are you sure it's safe.  pleakley: don't worry.  i supervised everything.  we couldn't find baking powder, so we substituted this foot powder we found.  i have an idea.  how about pizza.  now you're talkin'.  i want anchovies on my half.  of all earth foods, evil genius' pizza almost makes chewing worthwhile.  heh heh.  captioning made possible bydi channel and department of education captioning performed bythe national captioning institute, inc.    we're going on a trip in our favorite rocket ship    zoomin' through the sky, little einsteins    climb aboard, get ready to explore    there's so much to find, little einsteins    we're going on a mission    start the countdown   5, 4, 3, 2, 1.   everyone to rocket, rev it up now   brrr.   we're going on a trip in our favorite rocket ship    zoomin' through the sky, little einsteins    climb aboard, get ready to explore    there's so much to find, little einsteins   come on.  let's go.   little einsteins   we need you.    ok, we're starting. this is it.  shh, shh, shh.  captioning made possible bydisney abc cable networks group ..  by the ancient egyptians.  and music.
