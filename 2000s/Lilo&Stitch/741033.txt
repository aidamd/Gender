"don't expect to get out anytime soon.  " so, that is the game you want to play, huh.  ach glach nach gaga.  computer voice: hamsterwheel detention code override sequence activated.  hamsterviel.  gantu.  sir, yes, sir.  speak up when i'm talking down to you.  how many experiments have you caught so far.  uh, how many.  that is a good question.  you see, i've been telling him he should do some kind of inventory.   oh, the brown one, the pink one, the little green guythat's 3.  that one whose hair is always clogging the sink.  and the one with the 2 things that " ..  some. some.  oh, and how many does the little girl have.  ..uh, more.  i must have all, or at the very least most.  i know it's taking a while, sir, but i can do better.  nrrgh.  you will capture all the experiments, even if it takes you another 10 years.  brother, another 10 years of this.  woman: sorry, lilo.  no stray dogs this week.  they don't have to be just dogs.  anything that breathes fire or spits acid or anything that maybe reminds you of stitch.  bark.  ..  well, it's not a dog, but someone brought in this little guy yesterday.  yow.  weird enough for you.  plenty.  how much longer am i having to wear thisthisahahchoo.  evil geniuses allergic to taffeta.    so what exactly makes this little fella so dangerous.  during evil days, jumba too impatient to wait for microwave to reheat leftovers.  i make 089 so i could skip ahead 10 minutes.  what happened.  heek. big mistake.  i put burrito in microwave, activated experiment and boom.  10 years go by.  he skips 10 years, huh.  well, i guess we better go find his one true place.  i look at it this way: if i ask nani's permission, she'll say no.  but if i skip ahead 10 years, i'll be old enough that i won't have to ask permission.  gabba.  stay next to me, stitch, so you'll skip, too.  here we go.  ogata.    lilo.  are you ok.  da. day.  it worked.  i'm a teenager.  holy cannoli.  uh. that's not my voice.  hello.  testing, 1, 2, 3.  my name is lilo and i am a teenager.  ha ha.  ..ichi nawa.  you look exactly the same.  i guess genetic experiments age differently than humans.  maybe you can grow a goatee.  that'd make you look older.  ..nani.   nani.  uhoh.   shh.  nani.   lilo.  you're back.  uhh.  uhh.  you are in 10 years of trouble, young lady.  let me go. oh, no.  i've been waiting 10 years to yell at you for this.  yeah, you go to your room.  you are super extra grounded.  you can't ground me. i'm not a kid anymore.  yeah, but you're still my little sister and i still make the rules.  this is why i skipped 10 years in the first place.  you're always treating me like a child.  i'll stop treating you like a child when you stop acting like one.  lilo, i brought you some lunch.  you must be hungry if you haven't eaten in 10 years.  i'm old enough to make my own lunch now.  i guess i forgot what it's like to be in a hurry to grow up.  i spend most of my time wishing i could go back to being a kid.  there's nothing good about being a kid.  you think that now, butah, you'll understand when you're older.  i'm sorry i mysteriously disappeared for 10 years.  i'm sorry i treat you like a kid.  i'm just not used to living with an obnoxious teenager.  you'll get used to it.  i did.   can i please go out and see what the town's like.  ..  but you're not going out dressed like that, are you.  i finally finished reading everything there is to know on fashion.  ..   lilo.  pleakley, i need your help picking out some trendy clothes.  boy, did you come to the right place.  island casual is so passe.  " you think i'd spend 10 years reading all these books and not know what's in style.  stitch: oh, hubba hubba. kacheefa.  here are keys to buggy.  make sure to activate alarm when you park it.  come on, stitch, let's go have some fun.   may i see your license, please.  ..license.  i guess i kind of missed out on getting one.  yeah, well, you're not missing out on tickets.   that one is a repair order.  your brake light's out.    look, stitch.  ..ix: return of another final chapter part 2.  i guess we missed a few sequels.   ha ha ha ha ha.  that is the ugliest outfit i have ever seen.  myrtle.  it's me, lilo.  weirdlo.  from when we were kids.  well, that certainly explains your ridiculous getup.  for your information, these are the latest fashions.  yeah, from 10 years ago, maybe.  try picking up a current fashion book once in a while.  uh, myrtle.  we're going in to see wasp mummies.  you want to join us.  wasp mummies. as if.  those movies are for babies.  aaaaah.  by the way, it looks like you got a ticket.  another ticket.  nani's gonna be furious.   hey, parking guy.  you can't give me this.  we were i am sorry, but there is nothing i canlet go.  hamsterviel. what are you doing out of prison.  earth girl.  how did youbut i'm on parole.  who would be dumb enough to parole you.  i am now a reformed, productivelyproducing member of society.  now, if you'll excuse me, i have a quota to meet. goodbye.  hamsterviel: phew. that was a close one.   yes, sir, dr. hamsterviel.  the earthling experiment hunter girl has returned.  hmm. that's rather pesky, but it's no matter.  i have virtually all the experiments in my prison.  this is good.  proceed now to phase number the second.  yes, sir.  so far being a teenager is a drag.  echh.  maybe we just didn't skip forward far enough.  maybe if i was even older, things would be even funner.  daba da.  ok, skip, punch it.  did it work.  nani.  it did.  i'm a fullfledged grownup.  cool. huh.   ..  is this your car.  uh, no.  well, i feel sorry for whoever owns it.  it's breaking about a million laws in the hamstervielville city code.  hamstervielville.  but this is kokawatown.  miss, this place hasn't been kokawatown for at least 5 years.    it's hamsterviel.    ..  i think we skipped too much.  aaaah.   we've got to get home and find out what's going on.  ogi takka.  lilo: oh, no.  these are all the old experiments i caught 20 years ago.  stitch, we've got to get you and skip out of here before you getman: hold it right there.   toobi chiba.  no. stitch.  stitch, look out.  burumba.  if you want them, you're gonna have to get through me.  lilo.  i'll be back for you, stitch.  halt.  let her go.  the boss only cares about the experiments.  nani.  jumba. pleakley.  anybody.  jumba: little girl.  huh. jumba.  it is you.  notsolittle girl, you're a sight for my eyes to go sore to look at.  jumba, what happened here.  uhh, house was repossessed to pay for unpaid parking tickets.  why didn't you just move the car.  you had the keys.  oops.   i have been hiding in attic, eating only canned rutabagas and rainwater ever since emperor hamsterviel took power.  emperor.  he captureded all experiments because you were not here to catch them with 626.  where is 626.  they just arrested stitch and skip.  we're gonna need more help to rescue them.  where's nani.  eh, is not such happy story.  to pay off debt, bigger bigger girl went to work for hamsterviel.  she is his personal water bottle holder.  there were a lot of parking tickets.  what have i done.  ahchoo.   there is some good news.  pleakley is international fashion celebrity.  pleakley.  he has top ten tv show on intergalactic fashion channel.  so remember, that's flannel gauchos for the look that's all the rage in milwaukee this season.   now let's take a few callers.  hi, pleakley.  it's your old pal lilo, and have i got a makeover for you.  well, if it isn't the trog and the fugitive.  i've waited a long time for this moment.  gantu. jakata quista.   still abominable as ever.  hey gantu, we got a collect holocall coming in from hamsterwheel.  hamsterviel: viel. hamsterviel.  you want i should accept the charges.   do i have a choice.  i heard that.  i should have you turned into friday night fishsticks served with many tasty dipping sauces.  emperor hamsterviel, to what do we owe this pleasure.  my ohsosneaky spying spy says 626 has been caught, yes.  i wish to heckle him.   you thought you could defeat me, huh.  you and that little girl with her silly islander fashion and language with primitive vowels.  it is i who will laugh last.  ha ha. see.  that was the last laugh.  ahem, sir, if you don't minddo you see this shiny thing on my head.  how much bigger and more expensivelooking it is than yours, hmm.  you can continue when i am finished.  ohhok, i'm finished.  goodbye, abominations.  hold it.  this is a fashion emergency.  wait, i know you.  well, you can't have seen my show, or you wouldn't be wearing this awful allyellow ensemble.  ugh. you look like a giant talking banana.   while my assistants redecorate your room, i'll see what i can do for your personal sense of style.  well, so what you think. pink or blue.  definitely the pink.  .. voila.  quelle parfait.  oh, my work here is finished.  hey.  open this door.  perhaps best escape is for little girl to be using 089 again.  but, jumba, i don't want to skip forward anymore.  i just want everything to go back to the way it was.  conveniently, 089 comes equipped with reset button.   now you tell me.  now seems good.  ok, see you guys later.  i mean, see you earlierbefore. you know what i mean.   yay. i'm back to myself again.  .. nani.  nani.  what. what is it.  nani. nani. nani. nani. nani.  you're acting as though you haven't seen me in years.  i haven't.  ..  maybe i was a little too strict last night.  you're growing up whether i like it or not.  forget about it.  i think i'm perfectly happy being your baby sister for awhile.  who are you and what have you done with lilo.  you'll understand when you're older.  i just hope i understand you when i'm older.  captioning made possible byabc
