 invented to start people arguing.  why would anyone invent that.  i guess when people are fighting, they don't notice someone else taking over their planet.  oh, i never thought of that.  if you think like an evil scientist, it makes perfect sense.  well, did he invent a way to stop people from arguing.  that wouldn't be evil.  like that.  gaba eek.  penny:..  lilo: alien mutation.  right. before gantu gets to it.  he's the big dummy alien.  right.  because he would send it to a hamster who's in space prison.  dr. hamsterviel.  he wants to contro ok, i think you all get way too much sun on this island.  i'm telling you the truth.  in that case, i'm gonna need some more paper.  there he is.  .  what do you mean, .  but, dear, it's our honeymoon.  stitch. he's attacking everyone.  is

to the wrestling match or not.  uh, yes, it does.  right now, though, i'd like to step on the traditional hawaiian gas.  nice and relaxed. nice and relaxed.  lilo: everything's ruined.  shaka, lilo. remember.  we're gonna lose the experiment, we're going to get a terrible review, and we're never gonna have any more guests.  you need to do what you told me to do, hang loose.  in other words, chill, lilo.  right.  this is all your fault.  my fault.  i was just chasing him to help you.  some help. he's getting away.  i can see who is and who isn't getting away.   you let him get away.  i
