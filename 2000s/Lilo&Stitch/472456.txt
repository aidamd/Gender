"extrabig dangerous".  but there is no snootonium on earth.  so, no dangerings here.  "no dangerings here".  we'll catch him, bring him back here, and then figure out what his one true place is.  .. snooty.  we shouldn't be naming something that we might be slaying.  we won't need to slay him.  pretty soon he'll be snuggled up right here at our house.  oh, no.  you're not bringing another one of those monsters over here.   they'redangerous.  they are.  see this. and this.  and these.  all damaged by one of those.  stay away from them. far, far away.  don't worry.  pleakley's kind of a nervous type.  pleakley: i am not.  i just don't like these extremely dangerous little monsters ..  heh heh. don't worry.  he's mostly kidding.  ahchoo. ahchoo.  i think fear makes my allergies worse.  trust me.  i'm gonna prove that the experiment canbe good.   ok.    catch anything.  no. of courseyou didn't.  please, not now.  i sustained an injury.  know how i know you didn't catch anything.

'cause i do.  and i think it's an abomination, too.  really.  i don't get it.  why did snooty attack stitch and victoria.  .  that's what victoria thinks.  ding, ding, ding.  congratulations, lilo.  you finally made a friend with a good head on her shoulders.  i'm not sure she wants to be my friend anymore on account of i want to save snooty.   i say ditch the monsters, keep the friend.  you two are so cute togethergiggling and dressing like zombies and hogging the phone for hours.  oh, what i wouldn't give for a friend like that.  yeah. and she does love stitch.  well, there ya go.  she loves the monster that really counts.  what more could you ask for.  i wish she trusted me.  mm, my scans indicate that 626 is completely healthy.  so why is he wiped out.  well, there is one change to 626's physiobiomechanology after the attack by experiment 277.  he has been drained of all mucus.  .  unfortunately, 626 is particularly susceptible to 277's attack.  his body is 62.7% mucus.  so he is now, shall we say, dehydrated.  but the effect is only temporary.  why would snooty want mucus when he was created to mine snootonium.  i ask myself same question and have come up with exciting theory.  snootonium is very similar in chemical composition to earth mucus.  experiment 277 is drawn to individuals with large quantities, like 626.  ..you mean...  snooty really is a vampire.  a snot vampire.  precisely.  then snooty wasn't really attacking anybody.  he was just doing what he was built to do.  yes. find snootonium and enrich it.  do you know what kind of ecological devastation could be wreaked on our little corner of paradise by a single barrel of enriched snootonium.  no biggie.  .  need i remind you that the ecological balance of this little blue mosquito nest of a planet is very fragile.  we have to find that experiment and neutralize it.  ah, jumba will work on neutralizing solution while you go find 277's lair.  i think i know where it is.  snooty was flying towards mt. waialiali.  we'll go in the buggy.  kiba tiba.  ..ooh.  i think i better drive.  is that what you're gonna slay the vampire with.  yes, though it isn't technically a vampire.  it is experiment 277.  and i'm not actually slaying iti'm apprehending it on behalf of jacques von hamsterviel, and transporting it to him on a prison asteroid.  as long as it's not on kauai.  come with me.  ..why.  just trust me.  ahchoo.   hang on. we're going around a turn.  can't you go any faster.  these are steep mountain roads.  safetyfirst driving techniques demand that i maintain control of the vehicle at all times.  this thing flies, you know.  .  .  ..  look out.  ..  .. aah...  . flying..  can't keep my eye on the road when i'm flying.  arda blah blah.  this is the lair of the abomination.  ahchoo.  what are these.  something abominable.  ugh. gross.  so, what do we do.  you just stand there.  the experiment seems inexplicably drawn to you.  ..  .  and why not.  you said i could trust you.  you live, you learn.   there he is.  aah.  aah.  i missed.  pleakley:..  lilo: wait.   oh, no.  the big dummy's here.    victoria: aah.  you're too late, earthling.  ..  thanks to your friend here.  victoria.  you're helping gantu.  i'm sorry, lilo.  i just wanted to get rid of the monster.  he's not a monster.  you've gotta trust me.  that's what gantu said, too.  one big differencei'm your friend.   ahchoo.   .. is the reverse...  on this thing.  heh heh heh heh heh.  finally.  now i can get back to my program.  not if i can help it. unh.  victoria: you big dummy.  oh, please.  oof. unh. ooh.  ..  it's ok, little guy.  ..saved him.   you were right, lilo.  he's not a monster at all.  i should have trusted you.  you were kinda right, too.  snooty actuallyis a vampire.  you know, a snot vampire.  no wonder he kept chasing me.  my allergies.    ahh.  i can breathe.  i think he likes you.  maybe he could come live with me.  .  he could keep my sinuses clear.  aha. finally.    pleakley: i hope he had insurance.   no, i didn't capture the experiment.  oh, hey, gantu, hi.  you'reyou're home early, aren't ya.  625, that's not the sandwich channel.  when did we get the cable back.  uh, you know, just now.  yeah, right this second.  heh heh. amazing coinkydink, huh.  it was never out.  you just said that so you could have it all to yourself.  i always said you were a semiintelligent species.   to think i trusted you.  ehh. you live, you learn.  oh, i've learned, all right.  i'll never trust anyone.  ready or not, boys and girls, ..  i love this guy.  turn it up, would you.  captioning made possible byabc cable networks group captioning performed bythe national captioning institute, inc.  tookie bah waba.  hao.  iki bah bah.  ha ha ha.   i laila 'o kaua'i la
