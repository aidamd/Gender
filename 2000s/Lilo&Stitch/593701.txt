 come on.   gantu: uhh. blasted trog.  we're outta here, stitch.  i'll be blitsnaked.  649: i got to hand it to you, kid.  that was quite the escape.  you two got great criminal minds.  when did we cross the big, fat line from having fun to being great criminal minds.  we've got to catch these guys.  i only got to go surfing once today.  better move on.  what are we gonna do now.  dump the car and lay low for a while.  we just need a temporary hideout.  where's your crib.  . we can't go there.  my sisteryour sister will never know nothing unless you tell her, which you won't, because we got dirty laundry on you now.  dirty laundry.  you don't want us to tell you've been out doing crimes with bonnie and clyde, do you.  i think we blew it, stitch.  uhh.  dicky copper, on tv: you couldn't have been drinking milk at max diner that night because you're lactose intolerant, aren't .  man, on tv: you got me.  you can hide in here, but you have to be quiet.   somebody's coming.  hide. huh.  boy, i wish i could interrogate people like detective dicky copper.  all right, you crooks, let's talk about your dirty laundry.  huh. our dirty laundry.  i know what you're hiding.  filthy, smelly unmentionables.  dark reminders of your dirty dealings.  relax. we just want to ask you a few questions.  we.  it's a good cop/bad cop thing.  why not make it easy on yourself, guys.  it's all gonna come out in the wash, anyway.  ..  quit stalling, halfpint.   ..  hey, hey. calm down, partner.  they're just kids.  you're a softie.  these little runts have made a mess of things, ..  or do you want to talk about it downtown.  iinani: lilo. i'm home.  you and stitch come down here.  i need to talk to both of you.  we gotta go.   well, that was fun.  where was i.  oh, thank you.  say, you two match the police description of a pair ofuhh.  nani, stitch and i are so sorry.  oh, forget about it.  who wants pizza and ice cream.  ice cream. mmm.  yeah.  i kind of overreacted earlier.  i mean, you were only roughhousing and burping.  it's not like you're criminals or anything.  and you paid your debt to society.  you stayed in all day like good little prisoners.  we're not hungry, are we, stitch.  bleech.  not hungry for pizza and ice cream.  why. ok, ok.  we'll talk.  we didn't stay in all day.  we broke out, and we met 2 of stitch's cousins who have been doing all the robberies, and we walked on the grass, and we t.p.'d myrtle's house, hasagawa's, and then we helped them break into gantu's ship.  we plead guilty to all charges.  oh, lilo.  why would you do things like that.  bonnie and clyde let us do whatever we want.  we thought it was ok because we weren't hurting anyone.  but, lilo, you were hurting people.  myrtle's mom has to clean up her house because of what you did, hasagawa has to pay to replace whatever you took, andand most of all, .. and me.  how am i supposed to trust you again.  pleakley: help. help.  now what.    help. they're escaping.  we've been robbed.   come on, stitch. let's get 'em.  oh. makka. makka.  you're not going anywhere.  but stitch and i are the best one's here at catching experiments.  yeah. too bad i can't trust you.  i've been given strict orders to keep you two little crooks here while nani calls the police.  but we've got to make up for what we did by catching bonnie and clyde.  you've got to let us go.  lilo, i know a little something about the law, and rule number one is don't let the bad guys go.  but what if we weren't the bad guys anymore.  what if we were good guys.  do you promise to uphold the law, bring criminals to justice, and never do anything evil or bad again.  yeah. yes.  then by the power vested in me by the dicky copper junior detective fan club, i pronounce you deputy lilo and deputy stitch.   deputies are not to eat their cookie badges.  since buggy was stolen, you good guy deputies will need other way to chase bad guys to their hideout.  a federation police cruiser.  a rad one.  ..  626 took it during his original escape to earth.  uflasium powered, seats 5, zero to hyper space in .02 microseconds.  also, note snazzy leopardprint upholstery.    you guys get going.  i know exactly what detective dicky copper would do next.  those coppers will never find us at our new hideout.  whoa.  huh. huh.  i've got you now.  what.  yeehaw.  don't shoot.  hop in.  we'll take it on the lam back to the hideout.  all right, kid.   did that car just fly away.  .. offroad vehicle.  our new hideout is the one place they'd ..  a place we already robbed.  that's clever, all right.  you made one teensy mistake though.  yeah. what's that.  ..  to bad.  you're busted.  scatter, clyde.  uhh. uhh.  nice shot, partner.   lilo, i can't believe you disobeyed me again.  you two are in real big trouble this time.  i'm going to have to take you down to the station.  oh, no, you don't.  ..  these are.  lilo and stitch and i infiltrated the thieves' gang so they would lead us to their hideout.  that was a good plan.  it's a very basic sting procedure.  don't you watch detective dicky copper.  sorry we disobeyed you again.  we had to to catch the bad guys.  so, are we off the hook.  well, you were trying to do the right thing, and you did get the bad guys, ..yeah.  you and me are cool.  but you and the municipality of kokaua town, that's another story.  this making up is hard work.  uhh.  and we still have to find the one place bonnie and clyde belong.  fortunately, we have 15 to 20 years to think about it.  captioning made possible byabc cable networks group captioning performed bythe

you want to go see what.  sludge mummies, episode iiattack of the bones.  but you didn't even see the first movie.  only because you wouldn't take me.  hello. you were 3.  myrtle gets to see p.g. movies.  her mom goes with her.  oh, and if myrtle's mom jumped off a cliff, i'd suppose you'd want me to do that, too.  wow. would you.  no.  there'll be no cliff jumping and no sludge zombie movies.  they're sludge mummies.  whatever. ahem.  lilo, look, i've got work to do.  i said no movie, and i mean no movie.  this is a picture of us never getting to do anything fun.  there's nothing worse in the world than being young.  i mean, what good is it.  unless, maybe, you're a puppy at the pound.  'cause nobody ever adopts the old dogs.  they just adopt the puppies.  that's what the shelter lady said when we went to adopt you.  but aside from that, being young just totallyhey.  that head. those tan lines.  i've seen them before.  it's sunburned ice cream tourist.  but now he's a baby.  jumba.  yes, it is very same human.  without doubting, this is work of experiment 151.  from the civic disturbances database.  yes.  idea was to turn entire populations into babies.  with no grownupers around to babysit little tykelings, whole planets are turning into bawling, squalling, unsupervised chaos.  ha ha ha.  much like jumba family dinner table.  ha ha. oh, i miss those day.  so, what do we do about him.  eh, effects eventually wear off on their own. )
