"d," stay home from party and eat whatever i want from fridge.  just stick close to me.  lilo, the hostess of the party asks you to play a piano selection.  what do you choose.  can't it be the bongos.  no.  oh, it'll just be faster if i give you the answers to the whole quiz.  it's "a," "c," "b," "a," "a," "a," handkerchief, and theminuet in e.  eh, will commit to memory.  now on to the appropriate clothes to wear.  my favorite part.  nani said it's supposed to be casual.  when yacht people say, "casual," " trust me.  then what do they mean when they say, "dress up".  oh.  when yacht people say, "dress up," i mean, wow.  gold crowns, mirrored sunglasses, leather capes, ruby slippers.  i mean, they really dress up.  and if someone asks you your opinion on the weather, say it's perfect for golf.   is that a wooly mammoth.  extinct for thousands of years. interesting.   a sabertooth tiger.   ooh, a sabertooth squirrel.  i'll have to look that one up.   cousin.  experiment 210.  so it turns animals into prehistoric animals.  not just animals.  was designed to weaken enemy by making weapons and technology primitive and useless.  i'm having a proud moment.  hello. yacht party.  what are we gonna do.  nani's waiting for us at the party.  but we gotta stop stitch's cousin.  luja. aja kaba.  you'll go get him.  thanks, stitch. you're the best.  cousin.  chi meetoh.  wow. so you guys are nani's family.  most enchanted to meet you, madams.  uhh. i mean, you're here.  and what are you wearing.  i told you it was casual.  they don't usuallyi mean, ..  ..  golf.  yeah, the weather was perfect for golf.  so we went golfing.  oh, she is so cute.  why didn't you tell me she was so cute.  well, why don't we all have some refreshments.  what an appropriate suggestion for the first activity.  i see you are familiar with dame lady marquez.  who.  so, nani tells me you're a doctor.  what's your specialty.  i'm developing serum to make person drool in 5 flavors.  ooh, you must be very proud of your sister being vice president.  she would be president, but she lost by 2 votes in ohio.  i think it's going quite well, don't you.  well, you could be wearing the belly dance outfit, so i guess it could be worse.   it's worse.  ohh. what is that thing.  don't worry. i'll do something.  aaaah.    huh.  ooh. oooooohh.  aahh.   lilo. get down from there.  normally, she's never like this.    lilo.  ..  huh.  jaag kaa.  this is not in the book.  but i presume, the guest turning into cave people is not good etiquette.  not to worry.  thinking there is way to reverse caveman turning into.  well, it would be very good etiquette for you to say what it is right now.  all we have to do isjumba.   ohoh.  jumba.  ..  not the ham. not the whole ham.  barr. barr.  barr. barr.  guys, no.  oh, what is going on here.  ii don't know what to say.  oh. uh.  aah. aah.   havah.  stitch, how are we gonna get them back to normal.  no problem.   ..  and babysit.  aah. aah.  hoohyah.  huh.  mi gata.  whew.   ..2... 1...zero.  ..  spank bottom.   bo tifa.  fasci nay.  ..  ii don't wanna be your queen.  ..  urr, urr, urr, urrrff.  ugghh, that breath.   hugaa.  the yacht.  it's a canoe.  stitch, i cannot afford to buy ellen a new yacht.  ..2...3.  huh.  ..mm...  ahem. cirka.  .. what just happened.  and why are we drifting toward the real sharp rocks.  and why is there a ham stuck in my teeth.  don't worry, everyone.  i'll explain everything.  after we paddle back to shore.  i'm sorry. what do you mean, paddle.  she means pick up a paddle and actually paddle.  but i haven't used a paddle since junior high.  nani teaches people how to paddle every day.  oops.  forget it, lilo. i got myself into this mess.  it's time for me to get out of it.  what on earth are you talking about, nani.  i'll tell you, but first, paddle.  grip here and here.  so i'm sorry i lied to you guys.  i guess i just wanted you to think i was doing something more important with my life than teaching people how to use one of these.  what are you talking about.  using one of these saved our lives.  i honestly don't care what you do for a living.  at least you actually work.  we're just thrilled to see you, girl.  so, you rent water sports gear.  yep.  you got jet skis.  yep.  well, what are we waiting for.  oh, lana, must we.  oh, come on, ellen.  we're on vacation.  you are still deadly with that thing.  she always was.   i'm gonna call you retro.  now, we just gotta figure out what to do with you.  maka maka. sasa.  people can actually come and see extinct animals.  we are gonna make a fortune.  it's a great idea, stitch.  reminds me of something i saw in a movie once.  i'm sure this will have a better ending though.  right, retro.

let me do the talking.  i'm sure i canconvince her to help us.  ohkee tuckah.  i know she canbe mean sometimes, but i have a feelingthat this time will be different.  i mean, it's for a good cause, right.  what do you want.  my sister nani's throwing a big dinner for charity on friday night.  so.  i thought we could put the past behind us .. in the spirit ofkokua.  helping.  what do you say.  your doggie is so ugly, it makes my eyes hurt.  girls: yeah.  ha ha ha.  good one, myrtle.  come on, stitch.  you're available. that's great.  we have plenty of room for you and your dancing poodles.  you charge how much.   ..  it's a charity event, and we were hopinghello. hello.  oh.  well, we didn't get pete and his prancing poodles.   what am i gonna do.  ow.  if you need entertainment, i strongly suggest you hire one of these.  it's called a standup comedian.  tv announcer:..  but seriously, there are benefits to dating a man who comes with his own padding.  it's like having a walking pillow with you wherever you go.  and if we ever flew together, i'd make an excellent flotation device.  ha ha ha.   why is making fun of overly rotund self.  well, earthlings develop a sense of humor about themselves in order to keep from being hurt by others.  in factoh, no. i know that look in your eye.  don't worry, this isn't like the time i wanted to be an ice dancer.  yes, i understand that you're a busy band, but my first, second, third, fourth, and fifth choice bands all declined, so hello.  nani, your entertainment booking troubles are over.  your charity dinner will be my debut as a standup comedian.  what do you say. huh. huh.  if i let you perform, will you do the catering, too.  did you hear that. she said ok.  i have my first gig.  i'm legit.  i'm gonna go buy a new outfit.  something that screams hilarity and comes with matching shoes.  jumba does not understand this charity business. )
