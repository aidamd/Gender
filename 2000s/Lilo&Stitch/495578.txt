. are gonna do it all .  mom. phineas and ferb are making a title sequence.  ndace: mom, the remote's not working.  you know, you could get up and walk five feet and change the channel the old fashioned way.  be for real, mom. i'd rather watch this stupid nature show.  i'll get batteries while i'm out.  man : this week on walking with nature: one of the world's slowest creatures, chelonia mydas, the sea turtle.  five feet, huh.  nah, still not worth it.  well, ferb, time to make the sunniest day ever.  i guess it's already as sunny as it's gonna get.  wow, it's not even lunchtime and we're already done with today's project.  think about it, ferb.  that means we have the rest of the day to do another project.  it's like having two days in one.  can't ask for better than that.  hey, perry, do you have any cool ideas for projects.   that's an egg.  perry laid an egg.  you know what this means, don't you.  we're gonna have two perrys.  congratulations, old boy, you're gonnahey, where's perry.   how did you like our new pneumatic transporter.  i used it myself this morning.  what. oh, who am i kidding.  the new pneumatic transporter sucks.  i mean, literally sucked every piece of hair off my body.  anyhoo, doofenshmirtz has bought up the tristate's entire supply of krill.  krill.  karl: krill is a small shrimplike creature that plays an important role in the diet of the humpback whale.  hmph. krill.  you know, ferb, perry's egg is getting kind of cold.  no, i don't think that's gonna cut it.  this calls for desperate measures.  we need the ultimate, bestever egg hatcher.  ferb, i know what else we're gonna do today.  five feet for popcorn, fine.  five feet to change a channel, i don't think so.  tv narrator: this turtle is seeing the world for the first time.  hey, this little fella's kind of cute.  here's one that's found himself in the unforgiving position of being stuck on his back.  watch as he instinctively turns to his stomach.  whoa. cool.  but the sea turtles' struggles are just beginning.  without the protection of their mother, they face many predators.  as you can see, they make easy prey, even though the safety of the ocean is a mere five feet away.   all right, ferb, let's get our nurture on.  easy does it. there.   activating temperature control.   initiating platypus lullaby loop cycle.   nothing says "mother's love" like a giant, robotic platypus butt.  unbeknownst to the delicate infant turtle, it's caught the eye of a sea hawk and he's looking for a meal.   sadly, the sea hawk wins this battle.  unlike humans, sea turtles don't have a mother to protect them through these crucial moments of infancy.   what's that.    hey, candace.  perry laid an egg.  it's okay, little guy.  candace is here to protect you.  what are you doing to this precious gift of life.  after perry left his egg unattended, we decided it would be best if we watched over it for him.  given the rudimentary needs of the average egg, we calculated the heat transfer due to elemental exposure, plus the positive developing life responses to familiar and expected sound and factored in the obvious visual surroundings.  the result was the platadroid.  but since we were pressed for time, we only built the platyposterior.  that's so wrong in so many ways, i don't even know where to start.  an egg is like a little baby.  it needs a living, breathing mother.  it needshold on one second.  okay, let's do this thing for real.  . doofenshmirtz holding a bucket .   ah, perry the platypus.  you're just in time for my backstory.  you see, it all started a lifetime ago.  i was young and in love with a beautiful girl.  she taught me how to see the beauty of life.  and i taught her how to hold a petty grudge.  she was very interested in whales for some reason.  in retrospect, it was probably more of an unhealthy obsession.  but to win her heart i created the whale translatorinator.  i rented the best oceanographic vessel that i could afford, and we headed out.  but when i turned the translatorinator on...   whale 1: what a loser that guy up there is.  whale 2: she should dump that pink chimp and go out with a real mammal like me.  doofenshmirtz: she left me for that trashtalking, 35ton pile of blubber, and broke my fragile, 10 ounce, utterly toohuman heart.  unfortunately, my translatorinator only worked in one direction, so i was not able to tell the whales what i thought of them.  until today. watch this.   )
