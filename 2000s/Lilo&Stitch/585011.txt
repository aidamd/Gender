number 128.  designed to turn whole civilizations into harmless insects.  .  you call this harmless.  lilo: we have to do something.  nani's calling the exterminator and now we're all bugs.  not to worry.  in my old lab, i can devise something to reverse the effects of experiment 128.  your lab.  you mean in the guest house.  but we're really small.  it's all the way out there.  and out there is really big.  yes. it will be dangerous and difficult journey.  we can do it if we work together.  count us in.  anything for lilo the builder.  i got my eye on you, bug eater.  zabuta.  first job is riding pneumatic lift from rooftop dome.  pleakley: oh, goody. i like rides.  why aren't we moving.  we are too light to activate weightsensitive disc.  we'll have to activate from manual button.  hey, i've seen little red and black bugs like you fly all the time.  i don't know.  i've never tried.  well, there's always a first it's back.   aaah. it wants my blood.  why, oh, why am i so tasty.   hey. i'mi'm flying.  aah. no. shoo. get away.  aah. no.  you can spray around the outside.  i just don't want them in the house.  heh. no worries.  this will take care of your little problem.  larger girl is stomping around.  run.  what is that whirring sound.  oh, that's just nani's vacuum cleaner.  no.   aaaah.  aah.  lilo. aaaah.  go ahead. we got you.  lilo: whaaah.  ga gatak.  626 says the way is clear.  just a little further, and we will be at lab, and i can change us back to normal.  yeah, and he can go back to eating us again.  naga. friend.  i think stitch has hadenough bugs for

 pleakley: all this tubing and wires.  are you sure this is gonna work.  yes.  is so simple to put back to normal.  i just need toon second thought, is very complicated and hard to explain.  this

get used to this being big stuff.  aaah.  bugby.  chimito.  now, this is gonna be a tricky one to replace.  i mean, bugs are cool, but i don't think anybody actually wants to be one.  reprogramming 128 was easy.  now, instead of working on living creatures, it turns harmless rocks into bugs.  heh heh.  lilo: ladybugs.  mahalo,lilo.  i'm gonna save a fortune on those imported bugs.  whoa. hey, look.  the mosquitoes have returned.  no doubt a delegation sent to apologize.  ow.  no. they're biting.  whaaah.  you call this gratitude for saving your species.  whaaah.  captioning made possible
