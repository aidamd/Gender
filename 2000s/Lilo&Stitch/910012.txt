 ready.  grr.  i hope the toast you're wearing stays warm.  i made it extra dark.  the little troublemaker is going to freeze the whole island if we don't get him.  it's icy, so be careful not uhh. slip.  grr.  ha ha ha ha ha.  i'm going to need more toast.  lilo: stitch.  stitch.   gotcha.  not even the trog could stop you.  ..me.  ha. you missed.  that's what you think.  huh. jakata crista.  you aren'taren't going to leave me like this, are you.  no.  aah.  blitsnak.  hello, cousin.  pleakley: finally.  the sun is back, and so are you.  you must've caught the little snow monster.  his name is slushy.  oh, thank the kings of bruplok 5.  no more of that freezing cold snow.  it's awful. just awful.  actually, is not awful enough.  only makes everything cold and wet.  heh. no. not very evil at all.  but it makes snow, and that's good.  you can slide on it, throw it at each other, even make snow zombies out of it.  so, want to try it with me.  all: no.  well, fine.  go inside. i am going to play in the snow.  all right, slushy.  do your stuff, but only for my house.  .. catch that experiment...  .. go any faster.  sure. i could use your blaster.  of course, you know what a lousy shot i am.  i mean, i might miss and hit you in the patookie.  no. no blaster.  i like my patookie.  i'm so glad you could come by and play with me and stitch, myrtle.   well, i'm not.  i think you and your dog are weird.  me and stitch are sorry you feel that way, myrtle.  here. have a snowball.  whoops.  looks like you're going to need head surgery.  did you see that.  snow can be delightfully evil, after all.  let's go outside.  pleakley: but the cold.   lilo: oh. hey, stitch.  aloha.  i know you weren't just looking outside at the snow, because you don't like it.  yeah. ick.  i understand.  i forgot to give my snow stitch arms.  these forks will work.  see ya.  snowflakes compacted into sphere makes for excellent projectile, heh.  ..  ha ha. very funny.  now all we need is something for you to fire.  ha ha ha ha. unh.   aah.     ohh.  ha ha ha ha.  whee.  yay.  oh, no.  ow.  oh.  brr. we better go tell slushy to cool it.  or, maybe not cool it.  oh, dear.  the snow maker got away.  look. gantu got him.  this is bbad. right.  yep.  good thing you like snow now, huh, stitch.  jumba: indeed.  experiment 523 works better than ever dreamed.  if ice spewing continues, entire island will be transformed from tropical paradise to frozen tundra forever.  it's very evil after all. ha ha ha.  oh, right.  not big fans of evil.  heh. sorry.  ha ha ha ha.  soon, the entire island will be a solid chunk of ice.  now that i have this impenetrable ice fortress, it will be simple to collect the remaining experiment pods.  well, how're you going to ddo that if they're bburied in the snow.  the pods emanate a heat signature.  that will show up only on my thermal scanner.  wwhat if somebody ttries to stop you.  there's no way anyone could even get up here to try and stop me.  don't forget your hats.  aah.  so, how are you going to defeat that little freezer burn.  burn. hmm.  that gives me an idea.  but i'm going to need your help.  whoa.    stitch: uhuh. naga. oh, no.  aah.  stitch: oh.   who would dare approach my fortress of ice.  and at this hour.  get the blasters.  i guess you could say i iced them. ha ha ha ha ha.  yeah. you iced a couple of snowmen.  let's go find slushy.   we're trapped.  you were foolish to think you could stop me.  we weren't trying to stop you.  just distract you.   huh.  hi, splody.  523, get him.  elemental evil genius experiments about to join in epic battle, and i forgot camera.  ha ha.  both: aah.  ooh.  aah.  aah. oh.  ha. he missed.  he didn't miss. just tricked you again.  yay, splodyhead.  do not be celebrating yet.  oh, no.   now, freeze them all.  choobie cheebah.  ccut it out. ouch.  that one was mine. ha ha ha.  stop. stop it.  i surrender.  we'll find you a nice home.  ..  splodyhead has to heat up the island.  got to love that hawaiian sun.  right, stitch. ee.  you just had to freeze everything.   i think i caught a cold.  i can fix you my famous chicken soup sandwich.  ooh.  luki: mahalo plenty, lilo.  your little slushy friend.  he was a real life saver.  not a problem, luki. see ya.  and thank you, stitch.  oh.  well, for giving snow a try.  i know you didn't want to try new things, but i'm glad you did.  bwah.  oh. wiwo.  ..  captioning made possible byabc cable networks group captioning performed bythe national captioning institute, inc.  tookie bah waba.  hao.  iki bah bah.  ha ha ha.   i

626's pillow.   you see. 199 is very nosy. heh.  .. why'd you make him.  to humiliate enemies by digging up most embarrassing secrets.  199 is quite entertaining with so much juicy gossip, no.  we'd better hide him.  he might cause trouble at nani's brunch.  let me guessyou didn't catch an experiment.   if you were a spying experiment, where would you be.  easythe sandwich shop to steal their
