 jumba.  yes, it is very same human.  without doubting, this is work of experiment 151.  from the civic disturbances database.  yes.  idea was to turn entire populations into babies.  with no grownupers around to babysit little tykelings, whole planets are turning into bawling, squalling, unsupervised chaos.  ha ha ha.  much like jumba family dinner table.  ha ha. oh, i miss those day.  so, what do we do about him.  eh, effects eventually wear off on their own.  when.  18 to 21 years, depending on state and local ordinances.  18 to 21 years.  we'll all be mummified by then.  there is one other solution.  special growing up formula that reverses 151's effects.  unfortunately, is impossible to create formula.  why.  0 computer refuses to read old 1.0 files.  piece of bletsglorp.  too bad jumba's computer is on the blink.  we don't even know what 151 looks like.  iko bah dah.  that's gotta be it.  go get him.  cousin.  huh.  ha ha ha.  good job, stitch.  let's go.  bark, bark.  it's your little friend lilo.  lilo, over here.  mom, don't.  do you wanna see sludge mummies with us.  we've got an extra seat.  mom, that seat is for our purses.  right, girls.  all: yeah.  no, thanks, mrs. myrtle's mom.  i've got an alien in my backpack, and we've really gotta get home quick to have it genetically redesigned.  oh, yes. i see.  it can't stay here on earth unless it learns to channel its destructive impulses.  yes. exactly.  oh, great.  weirdlo's making your mom into a weirdlo, too.   lilo. i told you no sludge mummy movies.  nani.  but ii didn'tdidn't think i'd come by and check.  well, you were wrong.  uh, heh heh.  oh, trouble coming.  i can't believe you disobeyed me.  i said you couldn't see that movie.  how come you're always telling me what to do.  because i'm the older sister here.  i'm the babysitter.  i am not a baby.  and you're not an adult.  you're just a grownup.  whatever.  i'm responsible for you, lilo.  that means i'm all about what's best for you.  so what i say goes.  you mean, like a dictator.  go to your rooftop dome.  i'm already there.  aah.  aah.  stupidhead nani.  she gets to tell us what to do just because she's older.  if only i was older than her.  then we could go see attack of the bones.  uhoh.  hee hee hee. bala.  i'm telling you, i heard something.  aah.   huh.  uhoh.   this is bad.   well, now that i'm the oldest, i guess i'm in charge.  ..what do i do.  i guess adults always just do whatever they wa so, let's go to the movies.  come on, gang.  ha ha. hee hee.  whee. evil. ha ha ha.  jumba, no.  i'm in charge now.  and i say you have to stop being evil and go to the movies with me.  heh heh. hee hee.  ha ha ha.  play time. play time.  nani, how many times have you told me you can't play in the dryer.  stitch, no.  i made oops in my pants.  nani, no.  jumba, no.  ha ha ha.   stitch. no.  i make more oops in my pants.    i guess the movie's off.  i'm the mother of 4.  ha ha. whoa.  whoa.  aah.  whoa.  aah.  ha ha ha.  unh. mine.  mitz me.  now she's gonna need surgery again.  rrr. you're both grounded.   aah.  this is all your fault.    oh, no. not gantu.  not now.  it's nap time.   i knew i'd find you here, you pudgy little winged abomination.  no. leave it alone, you big dummy.  oh. and who's going to stop me, little girl.  you and your infant army.  pblblblbl.  ha. this was the easiest one ever.   being the bigger sister tanks.  i don't know how you do it.   pleakley.  not again.  yes, i'm calling for a babysitter.  are you available.  today.  right now. why.  because, i have to rescue a genetic mutant alien from another really giant fishfaced alien, but i can't take 4 babies along.  because you know what that would be.  that's right. child endangerment.  i'd be the worst bigger sister there ever was.  so get your hiney over here and look after these babies so i can save the genetic mutant and find the one place it truly belongs.  and we can all live happily everhello.  .    a babymaking experiment.  hey, aren't humans capable of doing that all by themselves.  no, no, no. it turns grownups into babies.   really, eh.  yes, babies.  hmm. hey, i'm feeling a little peckish.  how about making me a.  huh. no.  ha ha ha.   ha ha ha.  sorry, g. i couldn't resist.  i always wondered if you started out like a guppy or a tadpole.  turns out you were just a smaller kind of ugly.  hoh. aerial attack.  whew.   la la la   gantu.  did my hamster eyes just see what i thought they saw.  the escape of yet another valuable experiment.  and why are you acting like a baby, you

normal age again.  ..how'd you fix the computer.  hee hee. evil genius child prodigy.  one cup of milk, 3 mashed bananas, 2 teaspoons apple sauce, and what.  a dollop of 100% kona coffee.  but you've

jittery at all. no, no, no.  wow. is that the time already.  remember how to use this.  unh.  you're back.  thank goodness i'm the little sister again.  being responsible is hard.   yeah.  but it can be pretty satisfying when you raise a good kid.  i am pretty good, huh.  in fact, i wanna reward you for being babysitter for a day.  let's go see some sludge mummies.  attack of the bones.  really.  i kinda forgot what it was like to be a kid.  now i remember.  when you've gotta see a scary movie, you gotta see a scary movie.  but we're not taking that thing with us.  so do your finding its one
