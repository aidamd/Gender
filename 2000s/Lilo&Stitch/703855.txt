look at this.  this is an actual replica of an artist's interpretation of what some random guy of no significance believed that the chariot of asparagus might have looked like.  and this is asparagus, the greatest warrior in all of greece.  with this golden chariot, he would win every race.  and here he is defeating the minotaur, a creature that's half man, half bull.  asparagus defeated him using the head of medusa, a creature so ugly she could turn people to stone with just one look.  kinda reminds me of candace.  it does not look like me.  i know what we're gonna do today.  we're gonna have our own chariot race like hey, where's perry.   psst. psst.  agent p, over here.  sorry to disturb you at the museum.  we've just been informed that doofenshmirtz has created a machine to rid the world of platypuses, uh, platypi.  platypeople. whatever.  we've tracked doofenshmirtz to the old abandoned movie house.  so get going and don't look up my skirt.  ok, the race will start here at home, then through the streets of danville and over to the park.  from there we make our way past paul bunyan's pancake house...  . paul bunyan's, where the food is good .   but not too good, eh.  ...and finish at the steps of the museum.  hey, boys, whatcha doin'.  just mapping out our route for the big chariot race we're gonna have.  oh, excellent. it's good to see you boys taking an interest in greek mythology.  i'm doing the same.  i've got over 12 hours of gladiator movies here i wanna watch.  nice hat, mr. flynn.  thank you, isabella.  it's my moviewatching hat.  isabella, we're gonna

special just for you.  you see, until now, every attempt to eradicate you has been foiled.  then i came across a  excuse me. who are you and what are you doing here.  i bought a ticket to see this movie.  ok, just roll the film.   the platypus is one of our greatest friends in nature, a humble but key component in mother nature's delicate cycle of life, but as of late, worldwide populations have been declining to near endangerment.  but why. who is the enemy of the platypuses.  or... well, you know what i mean.  this is the best platypus movie i have ever seen.  historically...   ...the enemies of the platypus were well known.  the poisonous swamp viper, the snaggletooth badger, and duplicating imitatable stunts seen on television.  but there is a new enemy of the platypus, one whose tireless development paves over the platypus's woodland homes.  the greatest enemy of the platypus is man.   hi there.  ah, you see, perry the platypus.  for years i've been trying to rid myself of you with traps and bombs and poisonous gas and automatic tennis ball machines.  i... i don't even know what i was thinking back then.  but now i have the ultimate platypus elimination weapon.  perry the platypus, recoil in horror at my new creation  )
