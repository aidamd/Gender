but take it from meuhuh.  i need 3 more boxes to sell, please.  but, lilo, the contest is over.  ohh. over.  ..did i win.  i don't think so.  this is the money i got from that little sandwicheating guy.  you mean when you sold slick.  .. which means i win and you don't.  so, do i get the grand prize now, or is there an awards banquet.  i am thinking no banquets.  what is that. a gerbil.  lilo:

but for now, heh.  is good for nothing.   tata.  if we don't count myrtle's gerbil money, then the contest is a tie.  ..looks like someone didn't sell their whole box.  we each take one.  first sale wins.  on the count of 3.  ..  .. 3.  sell.  let me in. buy my candy.  how's a gift for your wife sound.  so. you thought you could get away.  one moment. ahchoo.  uhh. use a tissue.  guess who always

candizite.  uh, it's just a chocolate bar.  it is. i'd recognize the smell anywhere.  choculum candizite is the most concentrated health nutrient in the known galaxy.  boy, am i craving something sweet.  a customer. he's mine.  i saw him first.  wait. i must have your choculum candizite.  just one lick could cure my cold for a year.  stitch. give it back.  lagafor cousin.  i'll make a trade. we'll call it even.   deal.  hmm.  thanks for helping us raise so much money, lilo.  you really helped the community.  maybe you'll win the contest next year.  it's ok myrtle won.  but from now on, i don't think we'll need to sell candy bars.  but we have to do something for a fund raiser.  this is slick.  he's really good at sellin' stuff.  maybe you could let him raise money for you from now on.  you'd still get to sell stuff.  it'd just be for charity instead of profit.  that's cool. right.  hey, when your customers are your friends, then everyone profits.  you sure you want another one, myrtle.  yes.  but you've had 17 already.  i won a year's supply. no limit.  i'm gonna eat more shave ice than anybody ever, ..  ..sick.   you kids know your friend is a little too competitive.
