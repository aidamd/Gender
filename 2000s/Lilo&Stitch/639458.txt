naga cada gu.  626 claims dishes fall and break all by themselves.  not buying it, mr. destructo.  go to your room.  ohhh.  if he says he didn't do it, he didn't do it.  all right, then, who did do it.  i don't know.  unh. well, i do know one thing.  we'll talk about this in the morning.  don't worry. she probably got some bad pizza.  she'll forget all about it by tomorrow.  heh heh heh.    gahhuh.   gunh.  shiriko.  hmm.  hmm. izzabeh.     huh.  oof.  aah.  somebody painted me green.    experiment analyzer device is sabotaged.  and my begonia has been plantnapped.  oh, the plantamity.  whoa.  that's a new look.  anybody seen stitch.  ..ohh...  ebaka.  ..  am inotsurprised.  i do not have time for this today.  626 has been very bad.  i'm very proud.  how do you know stitch did it.  anybody could have put a paint brush in his hand and pleakley's plant in the other hand.  ..  .  and myhound dogsingle.  ..stitch wouldn't do that.  yeah, yeah, it's jabanaga.  i'm gonna be late for work.  this behavior has got to stop.  hey, somebody dropped a picture.  why, it's stitch scrubbing his smelly alien toes with a purple toothbrush.  ha ha ha ha.  oh, it is to laugh.  that's hilarious.  hey, which poor sucker has a purple toothbrush.  oh.  bleeeh.  ..it.   oh.  he stays outside until i get home.  but stitch said he didn'tlilo, that's an order, and no buts, or i'll put you out with him.  fine.  don't worry, stitch.  it'll be ok.  hee hee hee.  whassa miserable.  just pretend you're camping out, stitch.  when nani gets home, we'll fix everything.  larger girl said no visiting with prisoner 626, he is being punished.  ok.  nani wants you to wear this.   stitch, i know you can break out.  i need you to show nani you're behaving.  if you don't, she's gonna send us both to the town.  whazzagub. waaahh.  since the accident with my record player, ..  you and i are gonna honor the king with a movie marathon, scrump.  a triple featureblue hawaii, thenblue hawaii, followed byblue hawaii.  popcorn's ready.  huh.    ruff.  logamooga.  lilo: what's all the racket in there.  that sounded likestitch.  bleeah.  nogamiga cava.  stitch not bad. was scary dolly.  scrump is very smart, stitch.  but she doesn't go around breaking plates and unspooling videotapes.   i saw 626 sneak in window.  had bad feeling he was up to no good.  ..i don't believe stitch is guilty.  i'm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt anda fair trial.  court is being in session.  judge jumba jukiba presiding.  626 is accused of all sorts of naughtiness and will be tried before a jury of peers.  how does experiment plead.  not guilty, your honor.  we are ready for persecutor.  your honor, my esteemed opponents, jury of toys, i will prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant 626 is guilty of all the heinous crimes with which he's charged.  exhibit "a"my poor begonia plant, brutally pulled from its home.  objection.  that plant was gonna croak anyway.  all his plants do.  irrelevant.  your honor, playthings of the jury, my lack of skill in the botanical arts must not blind you to the evidence.  exhibit "b"a paint brush, used to paint a sleeping nani.  found in the defendant's possession.  objection.  someone probably put it there and framed stitch.  where wereyou last night, huh, pleakley.  me.   hey, hey, hey.  counsel for defenseplease to playing fair. carry on.  exhibit "c", your toynessesa record player trampled to pieces mercilessly by the defendant.  objection.  itit could have got broken some other way.  maybe.  ..  defendant 626.  stitch, do you promise to tell the truth, all the truth, and every little bit of the truth, just like the king of rock 'n' roll.  ummh.  stitch, please tell the court in your own words, did you do any of those bad things.  robota gito.  626 says he has no memory of crimes.  he claims was sleeping all during the time.  the defense rests.  pfft.  she's in contempt, your honor.  am not. this ismyhouse.  i can do whatever i want.  little girl has point.  proceed with crossexamination.  you better believe it'll be cross.  ahem.  so, defendant 626, you claim to have been sleeping.  nice alibi. i'm being sarcastic.  and while there is no eyewitness to the crime, defendant 626 was nevertheless caught in the act.  exhibit "d".  perhaps stitch would like to explain this photograph clearly revealing him using nani's toothbrush to scrub his putrid, purple toes.   wasn't it defendant 626 who chewed off the arm of mr. fluffy bear here.  objection.  i sewed it back on.  and how about little susie tea party.  anybody seen her head.  i haven'tbecause it's gone.  objection.  stitch didn't mean to eat it.  it was a freak accident.  ..accidentally hungry.  minutes ago, poor little scrump was found involuntarily admiring the defendant's dental work.  .. i object, your honor.  he's making it look like stitch did do it.  it's the truth.  stitch.  no.  .. killer..   order. order.  nani: stop.  someone. anyone.  you.  tell me what is going on with him.  perhaps 626 is reverting to original programming, becoming monster again.  a relapse.  oh, no.  my begonias can't take it.  happy thoughts. think happy thoughts.  so what do we do.   analyzer computer will do probing of every aspect of 626.  if he is going back to old ways,  we will soon find out.  test takes few hours, 626.  you'll be staying in there.  be back soon.  jumba is only gonna make sure stitch is all right.   now, i gotta get back to work.  maybe i'll bring home a pizza for dinner.  i guess it's just you and me, scrump.   aha.   lilo: scrump.  you guys seen scrump.  uh, no. not seeing makeshift rag doll.  am watching repaired videotape of king now.  how does he move his hips like that.  fascinating.  .  oh, no, you don't.  i saw you.  you can stand up and everything.  and you broke bleakley's plant.   yyou're a ghost.  a phantasmo or something.  help. ooh.  little stinker.  my begonia.  little girl should not be playing with rope like that.  i think it's the rope that's doing the playing.  stop that. hey. i don't like this at all.  hee hee hee.  of course. experiment 375.  designed to take possession of inanimate objects and create utter chaos.  well, he's doing a good job.  stitch got blamed for his tricks and was innocent the whole time.  i knew it.  what does it want.  375 has advanced programming.  now that we have learned his secret, will probably get rid of us.   hee hee hee.  the weapon is only loaded with net.  he has replaced net with my new laser cartridge.  i am so proud of his smartness.  i'm not.  and i'm just gonna faint.  i'm too terrified to faint.  how 'bout if i just scream.  aah.  hee hah hah hah.  maka the family. jira chiva.  lilo: stitch.  get us outta here.  i knew you weren't all bad.    you know, i think i'll just wait upstairs under the covers, ok.  megata.  megata.  whoa. suction.  aah.  my head.  my beautiful cranial orb.  there he is.  gotcha, troublemaker.  i don't see him.  follow that stop light.  ha ha ha hjojava.   no getting away this time.  come on outta there.  ..  eh.    nani: lilo.  this is one of those rare moments when i like to hear my sister yelling at me.  so i hear there's an experiment out there that takes over inanimate objects.  makes it look like otherinnocentexperiments did bad stuff when they didn't do anything wrong at all.  ok, i get it. my bad.  would someone tell me what this experiment wants.  he's never had a home because he's always jumping from place to place.  and i think he craves attention.  that's why he liked being in scrump.  wait, that's it.  make a left here.   oh. stitch.  ha hee hee ha.  macki and the hammerheads are still under the weather.  audience: aw.  hey, no one's allowed back there.     they love you.  isn't this better than causing chaos.  how 'bout if you make this your home.  yeah. nigoba nakachuba.   ready or not, buoys and gulls, macki macaw and the hammerheads are back.  hee hee hee hee.   again, little girl has found one place experiment is beloved.  yeah, she's good.  i owe you both an apology.  i was wrong about you.  innocent till proven guilty.  i'm old enough to know that. i'm sorry.   we'll forgive your behavior on one condition.  nani buys games and pizza.  ha ha.  i guess that's fair.   captioning made possible bydisney channel department of
