" move toward the door.  kick it.  look, this is stitch.  someone on a flying french roll took him, and he needs help.  um, let me get this straight.  the world's not about to be destroyed, and you need me to save your koala from an aeronautic sandwich.  stitch is an alien.  ha ha. of course. he's from australia.  626 is not koala, and is also not from down under land.  is dangerous genetic experiment.  626 possesses potential to cause unheard of destruction.  but he's better now.  hmm. kinda out there, but i've heard worse.  we're on it.  whoo. i just had the strangest dream.  someone took stitch, and kim possible came, andaah.  kimkimkim popopossible.  oh, no, you don't.  i'm sorry.  ..  the remarkable.  the ron man has that effect on the ladies.  just ignore him.  right now we've got to focus on saving snooch.  it's stitch.  and i'm going to save him alone.  so you can go now.  what a little joker. always joking.  "joking lilo" is what we call her.  actually, if we could keep her away from any danger, ..spankin'.  you got it, aunt blinky.  ..  uh, the little guy.  well, we were in the forest playing, and that's when the french roll came.  ..  jumba:  it cannot be.  pleakley.  do you see creature in pocket of spotfaced boy.  pleakley: what's the big deal.  i tell you what is big deal.  creature is not earth rat.  he's eating like experiment 607.  are you sure that's experiment 607.  of course i'm sure.  wouldn't be two such uglies in universe.  so i think we should use the xbuggy as an aircraft andlook, lilo, i really appreciate your help, but don't you have something else to do.  you know. something a little less dangerous.  well, i was making a baking man.  his name is light bulb.  he raises penguins for their milk.  eww.  notice deceptible and simple and innocentlooking design.  would never suspect tiny experiment could work.  fabric of space and time causing entire universe to collapse upon itself.   sorry.  your pink little companionis he for sale.  what, rufus. no way, man. he's my best bud.  i wouldn't part with this little dude for all the nacos in melton.  that is very heartwarming to hear.  however, i will be taking him.  haa. hey.  stop the experiment 607.  got him. eww. it's naked.  he's a naked little rat.  so he's your rescue team.  old friend, that's your aunt and uncle.  broken family.  don't worry. i'll find him.  show me the crime scene.  i'm thinking stitch was kidnapped by hamsterviel.  he's an evil space gerbil who thinks he's a hamster.  i'm telling you, if we used the xbuggyhey, i have an idea.  why don't you sit down quietly and safely while i look for clues.  ..like this.  oh, don't tell me.  there's something written on it.  it says, "if found, please return to dr.  drakken.
