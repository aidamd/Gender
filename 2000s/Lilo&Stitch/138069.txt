 ..  what brings you by today.  well, i wanted to ask the prettiest girl i know a question.  .. go ahead and ask, already.  i'm sure the answer will be yes.  well, ok.  um, i was wondering if maybe you'd be my date to the lonoikeaweawe festival tonight.  why of c i saw you in town earlier today.  you're the most beautiful girl i've ever seen.  who. moi.  unh.  wow. that lilo is stronger than she looks.  it's a world gone mad.  lilo, it's called camouflage.  he's supposed to think i'm an attractive earth woman.   someone found pleakley attractive.  not someone. keoni.  poor guy must have ear bugs eating his brain.  i fear it could be possibly something far and away worse.  here. look your eyeballs on this.  is experiment 323.  it must have been activated, and is loose on island.  one peck from its beak, causes victim to fall head over feet in love with the very next person they see.   whoa.  ooh. gipper.  lovesickness is very distractive.  it can bring entire societies crashing to standstill.  ohh.  so, keoni just got pecked by a hunkahunka burning love experiment.  is only thing could explain sensible teenage boy having crush on oneeyed noodle like pleakley.  oh, and i suppose he couldn't have just fallen for my brilliant earth female disguise.  i don't think so.  impossible.  naka.   don't listen to them, wendy.  your camouflage is flawless.  you glow with an inner beauty.  ..  what do they want.  tv announcer: and now, for the final parade ..  so, these are the most beautiful women.  hmm.  think it's time for this old getup to get out.  can we cure the lovesickness.  of course.  what kind of an evil genius would i be not to build in an antidote.  let's see.   ega nalakrista.  aah.  bah.  ..  computer has contracted dreaded nalakrista virus.  someone has been surfing on intergalactic net again.   la la la   it will take some time to unscramble files and find antidote.  pleakley: there.  tell me i'm not beautiful.  ..   "naturally be drawn to " uhh.  on a beautiful day like today, everyone's going to be at the beach.   including him.  everyone tells me i'm a very determined little earth girl.  keoni.  tsk, tsk. naka bo chifa.  come on, nani, just for a couple of hours.  i don't bite. i don't even bark.  david, i told you i'm too busy to go on a date.  " everyone goes to the lonoikeaweawe festival.  the old folks go, the little kids go.  lilo's going, right.  yeah. maybe i should go.  after that prank you 2 pulled last year.  what. nobody got hurt.  and everybody laughed.  .. not a date.  awesome.  ow.  i think i love her.  come again.  sorry, nani.  i'm going to ask her to the dance.  what.  every day, you ask me to go on a date, and the one time i say yes, you tell me you'd rather go with someone else.  i am not going to forget this.  pleakley: hi, boys.  could one of you help me with some sun block.  that is a completely believable request from a beautiful earth woman, right.  .. i guess so.  good. let me get out my lotion.  i mean, on second thought, ..  now. see ya.  wait. come back here. i'm beautiful.    ooh. naga.  ..  unh.  .. the abomination.  naka chika.   gotcha.  ga naba gotta.  hey. that's mine.  let's see how well you can swim, shall we.  ha ha ha.  happy sinking, 626.  ow. what was that.  i think i love her.  excuse me, miss.  bah ha.  ah. cousin.  gotcha.  so, keoni, if you're going to the lonoikeaweawe, it's a custom to bring a date.  yeah. i know.  that's why i asked your aunt pleakley.  she's such a hottie.  maka maka. salsa.   not now, stitch.  i'm trying to get keoni to ask me to the dance.  oh. you got hunkahunka.  perfect.  naga naga.  ..  do i have something in my teeth.  not that i can see.  ow.  i think i love you.  atta boy, stitch.   good thinking.  apatuka.  cousin. home.  uh, we can find the one place he truly belongs later.  right now, keoni and i are going to spend so quality time together.  right, keoni.  whatever you say, lilo.   ooki bobo.  ah, 626, good. here you are.  i have found antidote for lovesickness.  victim of 323 is infected by the proboscis injection in coordination with retinal stimuli.  therefore, a rehydration of optical nerves and surrounding sensory centers will negate the effect.  huh.  spraying of water in face will cure lovesickness.  ee chadina.  gantu:  i do    i do    i do, i truly do    love you   .. yes.  what am i doing here.  the experiment.  get out of my way, abomination.  what's this.  an invitation to the lonoikeaweawe.  that's right. you know it.  the king of camouflage has a secret admirer.  myrtle: come on, girls, let's get a shaved ice.  here comes myrtle.  quick. ask me to be your date.  ok.  hi, keoni. looking very nice today.  oh. hello, weirdlo.   now. and make it good.  lilo, will you accompany me to the valentine's dance tonight.  you're asking weirdlo.  yes. i love her.  well, obviously, weirdlo's put one of her voodoo spells on him.  it wasn't a spell.  it was a genetically designed alien mutation.  whatever. you're still weird.  and now keoni's weird, too.  come on, girls.  that rocked.  didn't that rock.  do you think it rocked.  ..yeah.  then, i think it rocked, too.  ..ok.  do you want me to be ok.  mmm, yeah.  then i'm ok.  i'm not so sure.  aha. i got you.  ow.  chinito.  yeeah.  ow.  i

you have fun with me. why.  i don't know, but i like you.  uhhuh.  do you want me to follow you.  do you want me to stay here.  who cares.  lilo: stitch.  good thing you're here.  man, i never should've used hunkahunka to peck keoni.  this fakey love is the worst.  did jumba give you the antidote.   good. i need to get some in keoni, fast.  is it in here.  naga. naga.  dunga.  oops.  well, how was i supposed to know.  why was it in a box.  huh. wha.  what am i doing here.  oh, shoot.  ow.  man: i think i love you.  second man: ow. i love you.  whoa. ow.  now what.  hunkahunka's going to make everyone fall in fakey love.  third man: hey, i think i love you.  ow. that hurt.  squeeba.  ok. i'll spray whoever he pecks.  you capture hunkahunka.  rockahula.  ee.  i don't know what came over me.  thanks for coming anyway, nani.  you're lucky i'm even speaking to you.  it was like i was under a spell.  but then i went for a swim, and it just went away.  yeah, right.  you men are just so fickle. ow.   ..  i think i love him.  what. hey.  i get your point, ok.  ..   i think i love you.  ow.  ow.  hey. ow.  ow.  ow. i love you.  ow, that hurt.  ow. ow.  i've got you now.  hi, there, 20 feet tall, dark and handsome.  what.  grr.  wait.  ow. ooh.  ..  ow, that hurts.  hunkahunka's too fast.  all these people keep getting pecked, and looking right at each other.  people: ow.  that's it.  you need to see someone for hunkahunka's peck to kick in, right.  unh doodadooda.   here i am.  ready to meet my secret admirer.  all: i think i love you.  now, one moment, here.  i'm a fragile boyuh, girli mean, girl, i meanaah.  chita.  ha ha.  gantu got it.  and now everyone is lovesick.  we're going to have to spray the whole room somehow.  where have you been, gorgeous.    what am i doing here.  ..  domo arigato.  ok. that worked.  maka maka. gantu.   let him go, stitch.  he can have this one.  we don't need hunkahunka and his fakey love here on earth.  you want people to like you because you're you, not because some bird bit him.  ohh.  may i have this dance.  ha ha ha ha.  whee.  david, i'm really sorry.  i don't know what came over me.  ah, don't sweat it. we're even.  any chance for another "not a date".  so, it was all an experiment's fault.  i guess my attractive earth woman's camouflage is a miserable failure after all.  keoni:..  you look really nice tonight.  uhoh.  keoni must not have gotten wet.  time to get over it, kiddo.  wow. you're beautiful and quirky.  i am.  i am, aren't i.  my camouflage is beautiful after all.  keoni had a real crush on aunt pleakley all along.  ooh. naga bochifa.  hamstaviel: you have an experiment.  give it to me.  faster.  why are you so slow, you slow, sharkything.  you're the most incompetent of incompetents.  and another thing i've been meaning to tell ..  i think i love you.  really. tell me more.  like that idiotic look on your face when you have no clue what you're doing.  it is so disgustingly cute.  and all the stupid things you sayaw.  how you make me laugh. i love it.  oh. exactly.  captioning made possible bydisney channel department of education captioning performed bythe national captioning
