woodchuck.  aw, such a good kitty.  mrs. hasagawa, be careful.  wait. did you call him kitty.  so many of the most unusual stray cats come to live with me here, but i don't mind.  they keep me company.  hasagawa, exactly how many "kitties" do you have.  oh, goodness. i never counted them all.   computer voice: experiment 111 activated.  hmm. what. what.  warning. experiment 533 activated.

we're going to catch all these experiments.  aah.  concentration of multiple pods falling to one location.  statistically unlikely.  but not impossible.  may i take your coat, madam.  no. away. go.  shoo. shoo, you little monster.  my evil creations, designed for interplanetary chaos, now like felines in lonely lady's house.  oy.  there's another. get it. get it. aah.   is this what i really look like.  214 designed to take only bad pictures of people.  ha ha ha. so evil.  don't worry, mrs. hasagawa.  we'll take care of the problem.  my friends and i are professionals.  butpleakley: i'm gonna

kitty.   um, lilo.  pleakley.  just a moment, lilo.  i wouldn't want to be discourteous to this experiment.  pleakley, this is not the time to be polite.  terribly sorry. i'm afraid it can't be helped.  it seems one of stitch's cousins gives one painfully perfect manners.  where's jumba.  over here.  pleakley: aah.   stitch.  ok, not so fast.  that's good.  you're safe now, mrs. hasagawa.  we got all the, um, kitties where they can't hurt you.  fata.  all done.  you're taking them all away.  let me get something for you first.  oh, no. you don't have to pay us.  no, but you have to take their special things.  the snoring one needs his pajamas.  the white one only eats canned wet food.  the orangey one has his special neck pillow.  hasagawa, do you really care about these guys.  of course. they're myohana.  yourohana.  ..  family. they're the only one i've got.  i'm so happy they're all back.   sorry, mrs. h.  i guess i was trying to help you when you didn't need it, and all these cousins found their one true place on their own.  hey, where's stitch.   hee hee hee hee.  no, you fly higher.  i insist. after you.  no, no, please. after you.  i do protest. you first.  uhuhuh. you.  jumba jookiba, former lead scientistof galaxy defense industries, you standbefore this council accused of illegalgenetic experimentation.  nice work.  guilty as charged, o greatmortalgax the malignant.  the evil geniuses organization, or "ego," was particularly impressed with your topsecret 400 series.  delightfully wicked.  thank you.  i'm hoping to publish the results inmayhem monthly.  well, there might be a teensyweensy problem with that.  problem.  as impressive as they look on paper, we've heard some distressing reports that your evil experiments are not acting ..  well, evil.  is inconceivable that you could believe that my experiments are anything other than totally and completely 110.6% evil.  we can't risk the scandal if you've gone good.  i'm afraid i have no choice but to revoke your membership.  mwah ha ha ha ha.  ah ha ha ha ha.  you've been working on new evil laugh.  is good one.  you don't think it was too much, do you.  no, no. was nice touch.  ..revoking of membership is cruel, even for you.  is lonely being evil genius.  belonging to ego gives meaning to evil existence.  i'm sorry, jumba.  i mean, iii'mnotsorry.  i revel in your sorrow.  mwah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.  lilo: now, you listen here, mister.  my uncle jumba is the smartest, geniustest evil scientist ever.  little girl, please to be keeping out of this.  you take back what you said right now.  ambacua.  and i suppose this cute little girl is yourevilassistant.  bwah ha ha ha ha.  not me. him.    ..tell you what, i'm in your quadrant next tuesday visiting my aunt bootsie.  if you can convince me in person that you're stillevil, i'll extend your membership.  it's a deal.  we'll see you tuesday.  ayiii.  we sure showed him.  what can we show him.  ego is expecting superevil science lab, not cutesy hawaiian homeyhome.  then that's exactly what we'll give them.  come on.   wor  hey surfers, we're going behind the scenes  of the latest disney movie.  .movie surfers.  hey surfers, welcome to new orleans.  that's right, it's where the new animated adventure the princess and the frog comes alive.  you will enjoy. i guarantee.  so why set the movie here.   well the animators needed a city where alligators love jazz.  .jazz trumpet.   humans get transformed into frogs.  that's new.  and magical adventures might be waiting just around the corner.  new orleans is a wonderful city.   it was a city that lent itself to the magic and the mystery  and the music that we wanted to incorporate.   which is perfect for telling a fairy tale story.  it's beautiful, no.  there's no other place like new orleans.   wow, it's wonderful.  new orleans is also the home of mardis gras.   and elaborate costume balls.   it's a city where anything can happen.  and the food is amazing.  order up.  what just happened.  which makes this city perfect for tiana, the movies hard working heroine.  the princess's ultimate goal is to have her own restaurant.   but she wants to do it her way, and on her terms.  .i'm almost there.  her philosophy is you gotta make your own fairytales come true.   certainly, she's not a character who's waiting  for a prince to rescue her.  so when prince naveen comes around it leads to a whole lot of things that she didn't expect.  you must kiss me.  excuse me.  please, it will make me human.  just one kiss.  unless you beg for more.   so one little tiny kissleads to one masisve adventure.  what did you do to me.   they end up going on a journey together.   it's so much fun.  i could use a little help.  oh, i will play a little louder.  where y'all going.  find someone to break this spell.  the only thing important is what's under the skin.  the princess is what you have inside.  and you can do anything that you set your mind to.   whatever it is that makes your pulse race faster.  go for it.  yeah, you know it.   well surfers, that's just a taste of new orleans and  disney's the princess and the frog  in theaters now.  man: oh. our house.   uh. oh. whoa.  ..do you have any sixes.  ha. fish.  bah. ridiculous earth game.  computer voice: warning. experiment 262 activated.  primary function: error.  262 has no known evil uses.  no evil uses.  say, i remember that guy.  jumba goofed up his usual pure evil formula and accidentally made an experiment that was pure good.  hoohoo, boy. was he embarrassed.  kept 262 locked in the basement when friends came over.  then hamsterviel will have no use for him.  ..now where were we.  ..oh, yeah.  i was saying how you look like a fish.  doctor.  you have a visitor.  ah. mortalgax.  welcome to my lair.  you may look around, but touch nothing.   and what are you working on now, doctor.  disfigured assistant.  is time to test the grossification chamber.  i, jumba jookiba, evil genius, have declared war on beauty itself.   oh. i am so frightened.  whatever will you do to me, you evil, evil man.  i can turn even the most attractive people into grotesque monstrosities.    watch it, buster.  behold.   nice work.  oh, no. what have you done.  moments ago, i was a beautiful woman in the prime of youth, ..i'm...   hideous.  well, i wouldn't say hideous.   yeow.  verily, i have become an affront to nature.  truly, you are the most evil genius in the galaxy.  oh, my.  thatisevil.  so, you extend my membership in ego.  ..but first, i really should see some of your other experiments at work on the island.  fortunately, thanks to evil genius hacking of secret spy satellites, cable provider, and neighbor's wireless network, jumba has multicamera recordings of experiments in action.  heh heh heh.  please to be watching experiment 501, earthquakemaker designed to split planets in two with devastating earthquakes.  eee. look at that.  hmm hmm ha ha ha ha.  jumba: experiment 601.  arrr.  the kickboxing experiment designed to kick every booty in the galaxy.  ahh.  excepting yours, o mortalgax.  turns from normal if ugly fine house plant to forest of destructive evil. ha ha ha.  also excellent for borders and window boxes.   deforestates entire planets in surprisingly little time.  look at him go.  experiment 606: creates big black holes of nothingness.  .  experiment 627: my latest invention.  is so evil, jumba can't even be describing how evil.  ooh hoo ha ha ha.  ah ha ha ha ha.  not bad, jumba.  not bad.  uh, i mean, how reasonably despicable.  mwah ha ha ha ha ha.  ahh.  and finally, feature presentation.  epic battle of 2counting them, pleaseevil dr. jumba jookiba experiments.  let's watch, shall we.    ha ha ha ha.  ah ha.  hee hee hee.  what.  rarrr.  very well, jumba, i've seen enough.  by the power vested in me by ego, ..    what is that.    where's kitty.   lilo: i've never see him before.  pleakley: what's he doing.  hey. don't go in there.  mortalgax: it had better be something evil.    oh, no.  mortalgax: he's saving a kittycat.  must be picking up live satellite feed.  ..  let it play.   kitty. you're ok. ohh.   well, jumba, i think it's clear that you do not belong in the evil geniuses organization.  good day.  maybe we should start our own club.  and so, as newly elected president of the association of alien rejects, reformed geniuses, and girls from hawaii, " i hereby pronounce this strawberry pie day.  does club allow almostreformed evil geniuses.
