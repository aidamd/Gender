 only problem with egypt is thatthe sandwiches here is the only sandwhich is here.  ha ha ha ha.get it scoob.  hee hee hee hee.  we haven't seenmelbourne o'reilly since costa rica.  it'll sure be greatto hang out with my favoriteexplorer/adventurer again.  especially sincehe's invited us on an actualarcheological dig.  that must be where we'remeeting melbourne.  shaggy: awesome.  scoobha ha haour kinda place.  first butterscotch fizzy's on me.   ptoo. ptoo. eww.  heh heh heh heh heh heh heh.   congratulations, mate.  you've just had your first mirage.  i hope it didn't feature poisonous lizards, like mine did.  melbourne. wow.  hey, thanks for having us out here.  holy doly, it's good to lay eyes on you blokes and blokeettes.  g'day to all of you.  g'doo.  velma: is this where we'll be doing the dig.  right you are, boogabug.  over there, nearby the pyramid of the moon.  melbourne: the artifacts i found so fartruly amazing.  i think you folks are in for a real adventure.  if anyone knows adventure, it's you, melbourne.  an urn from the earliest kingdoms.  you can still make out the hieroglyphics.  you could probably read these, too, if they weren't underwater.  the nile river is hundreds of miles from here.  well, something's leaking into my shoes.   huh.  whoa.  whoa ho ho.  guess i was misinformed.  zoinks. tell me this is another mirage.  no, no.  it is the curse of the mummy.  well, the night's a beaut.  we can just camp under the sparkling stars.  always the man with the plan.  great night to be camping out.  especially if we just ignore that spooky pyramid right behind us.   melbourne, can you tell us what that driver meant by "curse of the mummy".  it's an ancient story.  what little i know about the mummy comes from those hieroglyphics.  shaggy:.. awful, man.  it scrawled graffiti all over those nice bricks.  melbourne: ha. look closer, mate.  the symbols tell a tale of pharoah scamses the 15th, who lived 3,000 years ago.  he was done in by resentful slaves, and his mummified remains were laid to rest in the pyramid of the moon.  it is written that if any trespass on his land, the mummy will arise with his zombified minions and take brutal revenge.   like, are we by any chance trespassing on his land right now.  well, yeah, i reckon.  technically.  it's just that i've always been kind of allergic to brutal revenge.  zombies: join us. join us.  join us.  jinkies.   ha ha ha. it's the pharoah's zombified minions.  crikeys. run for it.  you took the words right out of my mouth.  except for the crikeys.  ..    ..crikeys.   this way.   ..  sand storm.  fred, where are you.  i can't see.  .. i think.   aah. aah. aah.  like, i knew i should have packed an umbrella.  did we actually see a mummy and some zombified tourists.  can't say for certain.  the desert night plays tricks on the imagination.  or else there is something to that mummy's curse.  we need to stick around and find out.  the desert day can get up to 150 degrees.  but first we need to find a bottle of sun screen.  daphne: oh, i'm so thirsty.  shaggy: i'd give anything for a ..  with a side of fries.  wouldn't that make you more thirsty.  ok, the side of fries, then the glass of water.   fred: there seems to be a lot of people leaving town.  maybe there's a sale on beverages at the outlet mall.  coins, please. coins.  uh, no thanks.  but we wouldn't mind something to drink.  where could we get some nice, cool water.  from our spring.  unfortunately, we are in the middle of a terrible drought.  that is why everyone's leaving town.  the little water left in ouliankar belongs to the prince.  then maybe we should find the prince.  prince kazzal affimir, at your service.  ever since ouliankar dried up, even i have been driven to beg.  but i can share my liquid wealth with thirsty strangers.  how 'bout hungry strangers.  i'm afraid for food and drink you must travel to the nearby village of zalqara.  i think all of us are ready for some nourishment.  prince, what's the quickest way to get to zalqara.  camel sam's.  last camels on the lot.  unlimited mileage, bucket saddles, camel hair upholstery, optional hump.  return them directly to the airport for your convenience.  just be sure to replace their water level.  you're doing very good business.  oh, since the drought, people need to leave ouliankar any way they can, and my camels are in demand.  seems like camel sam is actually blessed by the mummy's curse.   there's definitely no drought in this town.  that seems to be the happening place.  bienvenu, mes amis.  i am mademoiselle chantal.  do you have reservations to my bistro.  ah, a french woman. let me handle this.  ahem.   bonjouree, madmoselly.  uh, we've been out in the desert, .. pazdaydoo inside .. of the day.  i am sorry, monsieur, but you must wait in that very long line.  daphne: guys, look.  melbourne: crikey. those zombie types.  maybe we should find a place that delivers.  we need to get inside and look at what's going on in there.  i think i have a way.  madames and monsieurs, chantal's is happy to present for your entertainment pleasure, the fatima sisters.    hey, they're pretty good.  the only dance my belly knows is the cake walk.   ..  ..  time to make our exit, stage right.  belly, do your stuff.   huh. huh. huh.  whoo hoo. yeah.  hey. all right.  hee hee hee hee hee hee.  ..

o'reilly.  wow. you girls ok.  we're fine, but what's that.   this piping seems to go straight out there for miles.  velma: directly toward the pyramid of the moon.  uhh. unh. locked.  let me try.  i'll use the old cuticle trimmer sandal strap gimmick.   nice, daphne.  will you look at all those cobwebs.  this might be the world's first web site.  hee hee hee hee hee hee. reb site.  there's too many rooms to cover.  we'll have to split up one more time.  we might as well take the scariest way, scoob.  it always ends up like that anyway.   whaso this is where the pharoah was sleeping for the last 3,000 years.     unh.  phew. like, nobody's home.  ...  rraahh.  huh.  rrruuaaahhhhh.  eeeeeeeeee.  whoa.  whoa.  unh.  ..  huh. huh.  man, am i glad to see you guys.  join us. join us. join us.  it's us, shaggy and scooby, and you're hideous, sinister zombies.  but, like, that's ok.  ..friends don't judge.  oh.  aah. aah.   i could see you 10 or 12 times a day    i think it's best we do it your therapist's way    i grow my hair long and wear big coats, yeah    i get so lovesick my sad thoughts float    the time    you've got me running    news broke today, so we're not talking    i think it's best we do a little bit of stopping    i want a house on a beach and you in my dreams    i need water, yeah    and a love, love, love, love    the time    you've got me running    the time   ..   shaggy: for a place that's short on powder rooms, it sure is long on plumbing.  well, scoob, looks like we're being hunted down by our best friends in the whole world.  guess we need to do something besides the old standbysquivering and whimpering.  reah.   locked.  now, what would daphne do.  she'd trick the lock.  good thing i always carry my portable pocket lunch utensils.   fred would have been proud.  well, hello.  what's this gizmo.  if i were velma, i'd try to figure it out.  ..let's see.   whoa.  .. but what does it do.  rhuh.  whoa.  uhhhh. aah.  rrruuaaahhhh.  huh.  ruhhh.  join us. join us. join us.  how do i wake 'em up.  open sesame.  abracadabra.  unh. rrrelp.  quick, grab scooby and shaggy.  unh. oh.  daphne: we've gotta get out of here.  aah. whoa.   .. safe and sound.  rrruuuaaaahhhhh.  rrraaaahhhhh.  fred: run.  shaggy: oh, no, it's got scooby.  rrreeelllp.  ..unh.  time to unmask the monster.  all:.  me.  oh, no. not melbourne.  why, melbourne. why.  wish i knew, mate.  but it looks like i'm the mummy.  look.  shaggy: that guy found the emergency exit.  i'll get the blighter.  all:.  there's a mystic hieroglyphic symbol pronounced " it must break the trance.  you're a hypnotist.  wow, scoob, your "relp" saved our necks.  scoobydoo.  here are 4 words you'd never expect to hear from me: what the heck happened.  well, you guys weren't really around, ..  we had to figure things out.  i found this water works underneath the pyramid of the moon.  ..  velma: diverting water from an underground branch of the nile river, creating the drought in that town.  fred: so the pipeline we saw brought water to the other town, zalqara, and success to its cafe.  daphne: and all the other businesses there.  all probably owned by the mademoiselle chantal.  madame chantal. she's my wife.  it was all a scheme just to make the two of them rich.  he created zombie slaves to threaten intruders.  melbourne's dig was probably getting too close, so the prince put him and others under his spell to do his bidding.  and i would've stayed that way, too, if it weren't for you meddlin' nippers.   well, i wish i could think of a way to thank shaggy and scooby for saving the day.  if you could, fred, this would be it.  scoobydoobydooooo.    krypto    krypto   the superdog    krypto    it's superdog time    he's a superdog    he's a
