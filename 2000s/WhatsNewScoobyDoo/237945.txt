gonna pay for this.  rufus raucous, the magician the world watched perish on this very site, will return tonight, seemingly from the dead.  is this for real.  i don't know, but i do know i reported it first.  velma, you ready.  i'm not coming out.  just follow my lead.  you'll be fine.  announcer: please welcome the one, the only, rufus raucous.  i don't blame you for doubting it's me, but i intend to prove it the only way i know how: by astounding you, using only a deck of cards and my bare hands.   oh, sorry.  could you pick those up, velma.  now, nothing up my sleeve.  like i said, using only my hands.  huh.   jinkies.  velma, lend me a hand.  no way. these are mine.  there's a new face in magicmine.  impostor.  scooby, shaggy, now.  whoa.  huh.  velma: magnetic polarity. hmm.  whoa.  like, the ghost is grounded.  thanks to magnets in its shoes, the same magnets it used to levitate.  fred: hey, let me out.  like, where'd he go.  fred: hey.  it's time to bring the curtain down on mr. wacky pants' career.  velma: phylidia flanders.  rufus' assistant.  so that's how the ghost knew all of rufus' tricks.  wacky pants seemed like an obvious suspect, but he couldn't even do the simplest magic tricks.  the biggest clue, though, was rufus' cat.  it wasn't afraid of the ghost.  thus, the ghost had to have been someone who was close to rufus.  hence, phylidia.  but why, phylidia.  because after you disappeared, i was supposed to step into the spotlight.  i knew all your tricks.  i would've made millions, but del stone wouldn't hear it.  so you wanted to ruin del stone.  that's right.  and i would have succeeded if not for you meddling kids.  well, you'll have plenty of time to develop your own act where you're going.  yeah, like, as long as you don't try any escape tricks.  all: ha ha ha ha ha ha.   my heart is broken    and i'm feelin' kind of low      you're livin' in de nile   i want to thank you kids for solving the mystery and for luring rufus out of retirement.  he's agreed to play the spackle dome a few times a year.  on my terms.  hey, scoob, i think we finally found the mother lode of backstage grub.  like, those are the biggest fruit salads i've ever seen.   some guys are like veggies    some guys are like pie    but there's a party fella who's the apple of my eye    yet all his friends are peaches    sweet as sweet can be    but why he doesn't know it is a mystery to me    life's a bowl of cherries    and you're really cute    let me show you i love you    with a basket of fruits   hey, look at shaggy and scooby.  ..    ahh.  scooby dooby doo. yeah.  animation dep  garfield:       be careful, jennifer.  the unspeakable horror is nearby.  it could be anywhere anywhere at all.  you never know when an unspeakable horror will just walk in the door.   squeak:  "just walk in the door".   garfield: he's right, squeak.  an unspeakable horror could be walking right through that door any second.    garfield: whoa.    jon: hey, look what i have.  an accordion.   garfield:  .   jon: while i was visiting my folks, i found this up in the attic my old accordion.   garfield: please don't tell me you're gonna see if you can still play it.   jon: and i thought i'd see if i could still play it.   garfield:  i'm doomed.  maybe i can still make a break for the door.  ] i'll hide out in another state.  no. another continent.  another planet. another galaxy.   too late.  i heard the accordion.  aah. ohh.  aah. ohh.  eee. aah.  ohh. aah.  ohh. ohh.   squeak: aaah.   garfield: ohh. ohh. aah.    jon: you know, garfield, i was pretty good in my day.   garfield: what day was that.  because it's certainly not today.  ohhho. aah.   jon: i wonder what would be a good place to practice.   garfield: how about ecuador.  it's lovely this time of year.  ohhho.  oh. oh. oh.  i wonder if it bothered squeak as much as it bothered me.  yep. he looks pretty bothered.   squeak: make it stop, garfield.  make it stop.   garfield: i wish i could.  researchers have discovered that the accordion is the secondmosthated musical instrument in the world.   squeak: "second".   garfield: what.  you never heard of bagpipes.   squeak: oh, right.    garfield: it sounds like jon's practicing if you can call that practicing in the den, of all places.   squeak: why do people play that thing.   garfield: beats me.  you got to be totally without brains to like an accordion.   odie:   garfield: your honor, there's my proof.   squeak: garfield, what are we gonna do.   garfield: wait.  i have an idea.   jon:  odie, this is great.  i'm gonna practice and practice until i get real good at this.  .   squeak:  hey, accordion boy.  you have a mouse in your house.   what are you gonna do about it.  nyah.   jon: a mouse.  there's a mouse in the house again.   squeak: it's the same one as always.   jon: aah.  get him, odie.   odie:    jon: catch that mouse.  ] ] ]  garfield:  my timing is perfect.  in you go.  so much for the accordion.   this is our last stop before lunch, percy.  where do you want to go.   anywhere.  ah, the fragrant scent of garbage always makes me hungry.  hey.  looks like someone threw away a perfectly good accordion.   just throw it on the truck.   i used to play one of these.  i gave it up because hauling trash seemed, uh, like a more respectable job.   oh, no.  you're not bringing that thing aboardmygarbage truck.   jon: that mouse that got away he looked a lot like the mouse garfield got rid of last ..  and the one he got rid of the week before that and the one he got rid of odie. my accordion.  i left it right here, and it's gone.   odie:.    jon: oh, where could it have disappeared to.   odie:    jon: yes.   i believe this is yours.  don't throw that thing away again.  we're not allowed to accept hazardous materials.    jon: i don't understand this for a minute.    garfield: do you hear that, squeak.   squeak:  i don't hear anything.   garfield: yes.  and isn't it beautiful.  i think i'll go take a nap.   squeak:  after that run, i could use one, too.  ]  garfield:  oh, boy.  this cat feels so good.  no more accordion.   jon: i'll serenade you to sleep, garfield.    garfield: aaaahhhh.  ]  jon: garfield, are you all right.  .  ] oh, what am i gonna do.  maybe i should call the paramedics or a vet.  wait.  they say music has healing powers.  i'll play him a tune on the accordion.  ]  garfield: i'm in enough pain.   jon: that's better, but you probably still need first aid.  i'll go get the kit.   garfield: i have to get this this this thing out of here.  ] i'll find someplace for it where it'll never be seen again.   jon: where did garfield go.  and where's my accordion.  i have to find garfield, and i have to find my accordion.   odie:   garfield:  maybe i could ship it to some foreign country.  oh, no.  that's how wars get started.  hey, i know what i'll do with it.  farewell forever, accordion.   ] ] ] my conscience says it's wrong, but my ears are saying, "shut up.  you don't have to listen to that "  hey, cat.   garfield: wh didn't you read the sign.   garfield: "warning illegal to dump toxic waste, dangerous chemicals, radioactive isotopes, poisonous substances, and "  you want to make the fish .  ]  garfield: i see your point.  i'll find someplace else to get rid of it.  ] ]  odie:   ]  garfield: the trick to getting rid of something is making it look like it's something you want.  ] oh, look at the lovely, valuable present i got.  ] ] now to go home and enjoy the sound of no accordion music.  aah.   listen, cat.  i'm desperate.  i haven't eaten in two weeks.  but there are some things eveni won't take.  ]   odie:  ]  garfield: in you go.  ]  now i'll never see that instrument of evil again.    odie:  aww.   jon: first, my accordion ..   garfield: yay.   jon:..and now odie hasn't been around for hours.  ..  where he is.  ]  odie:  huh.    ]  garfield: no, it couldn't be.   it's just a bad dream.  that's all.   i'll just try to get some more sleep.    garfield: that's it.  that's the voice of jon's accordion.  i'd know it anywhere.  it's coming for me.  it's saying, "you tried to do "  no. there's nothing in there.  it's just my imagination.   i'll see for myself, and then i'll be able to go back to sleep.   it's coming for me.  no. no.  i buried you.  i know i did.  ] ]  jon: what's that.   ] ] odie. it's you.   odie:   jon: and my accordion.  ] and garfield.   garfield:  it was the accordion that did this.  it attacked me.   odie:   jon: come on, garfield.  we'd better get you to the vet.   squeak: cheer up.  i heard the vet say you'll be all right in a couple of weeks.   garfield: that's not why i'm depressed.  i'm depressed because jon got his accordion back.  i amsodoomed.   squeak: relax, garf.  i also heard jon say that it won't play anymore.  something about it being full of dirt or something.   garfield: really.  whoaho.  that's the best news i've heard.   jon: garfield, i have to apologize.  i was going to entertain you with a little accordion solo, but my accordion seems to have breathed its last.   garfield: i hope so.  i gave it a decent burial.   jon: and when i went shopping for a new one, they were way too expensive.   garfield: i guess i'll just have to do without.   jon: but you're in luck.  they were having a sale.   garfield: no. oh.  it can't be. it can't.  make it stop.  no. no.  i'd rather have the accordion back.  please. stop.  heeelp.     morning, jack.   you're a funny guy, jack.   oh, thank you, jack.  jack, i got to goget ready, ok.  good
