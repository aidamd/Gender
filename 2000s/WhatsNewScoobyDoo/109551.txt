"virtual wrestling".  what an enlightened method of experiencing the sport ..  whoa. ohh. ohh.  uhh. hurt.  this chart shows us how to pull those crazy wrestling moves.  now, let me see.  pull your arm through here, and you grab my left leg.  ha ha ha ha ha ha.  jeepers.  it's that restless wrestling reject.  but that's strange.  looks like he's only destroying the malachi crunch exhibit.  zoinks. we're stuck.  ha ha ha. a little help, anyone.   daphne: oh, no, he spotted us.  it's time for our fallback plan.  fall back.   they're gonna get you anyway    any way they can    i told you once, i'll tell you again    that it's all the same    you're all twisted    you're all twisted    you're all twisted    you're all twisted    they're gonna get you anyway    any way they can    i told you once, i'll tell you again    that's it's all the same    you're all twisted   phew. that sure was close.  i think the monster's gone.  or not.  i heard some commotion.  everybody all right.  did the monster do that.  those two don't need any help getting into trouble.  now, let's see.  ohh. ohh.  thanks, big guy.  like, who knew i had a reset button.  see, dad, titanic twist destroyed your exhibit.  that means he's probably coming after you next.  kids, i'm not gonna let a little giant monster scare me off.  we just don't want to see you get hurt, dad.  i can take care of myself.  ok, gang, it's time to split up and look ..  again.  only this time, we're going undercover.  do i even want to know.  ooh, the female wrestler's dressing room.  how great is this.  i wish i had a camera.  i wish i had a mask.  here you go.  ugh.  wow. mr. bosepheus sure has a big office.  there's bound to be some clues in here somewhere.  ohh.  speaking of bound clues.  the scientist.  good work, guys. let's wake him up.  no. no. no.  get me out of here.  great. now we're clueless.  find anything.  nothing my size.  hey. what are you two doing in here.  you aren't lady wrestlers.  uh, sure we are.  i'm, um, i'm bookworm.  ..  fashion sense.  the last thing we need is competition from 2 girly girls.  but there's an easy way to see if your story checks out.  unh. uhh. um, canwe try another move, please.  you're stretchingmy outfit.   unh.  daphne, the new spring fashions are here.  where.  unh.  so i grab under here and throw.  hey, it works.  what do you call that move.  the flying dinkly.  ok, guys, look around for anything suspicious.  like, i think that's daphne and velma wrestling.  and i can't believe velma knows the ozark mountain pile driver.  hey, it's titanic twist.  good thing it's just on the monitor, eh, scoob. ha ha ha.  i had to say it.  arrrr.  that way, freddy.  rarr. aah.  zoinks.  no need to panic, guys.  arrr.  ok, now you can panic.   freddy, you're a wrestler. like, do something.  my moves only work on opponents with an arm on each side.  ..  creepy contorted creatures.  well, it's a good thing we're dressed as janitors because things are about to get messy.  rarrr.  ha ha. wheeee.  hey, ronald. come on, let's go play.  oh, i wish i could, but i have to go to work.  bye. bye, ronald.  .    okay, here i am at work.  now we can play. woohoo. yay.  . ba da ba ba ba .  whoa. wahahaha.   arrrr.  ohh. hoo hoo hoo.  raggy, raggy.  rarrr.  good going, scoob.   rarrr.  aah. aaah.  unh. uhh. unh.  rarrr.  daphne: oh, no. titanic twist has freddy.  unh. uhh.  shaggy. scooby. are you two ok.  like, if my foot is supposed to be in my ear, then yeah.  now, what in the tarnation is going on up in here.  i got a sellout tonight, thanks to that wrestle maniac, and i'm not about to let y'all kids mess that up.  oooh. oooooh.  uhh. unh.  now go on with you, git.  i've got a sneaking suspicion about that mr. bosepheus.  but right now we've got to find fred.  i guess we should split up.  oh, man, fred's not even here.  .. split up.  guys.  well, if we're gonna search the whole jumbo bowl for freddy, what better place to start than the salted pretzel room.  yeah, salted pretzel room.  ..  we need to find freddy, so eat fast.  freddy, it's you.  what do you know, scoob.  finally, our eatfast plan worked.  rarrr.  aaah. aaah.  wake up, fred.  oh, wow, he's really out.  scoob, we need to lead the twisted titan out of here and away from fred.  hey, twist, are you lefthanded or lefthanded.  rarrr.  humongous hammer sure is suspicious.  i mean, who else is big enough to be the monster.  aaah. aaaah.  rarrr.  aah. aah.  rarr. rarrr.  humongous hammer.  thanks for saving us.  you're welcome.  sometimes these giant hands are still good for something besides cleaning giant ears.  ok. wait a minute.  if you're here, that means you can't be the titanic twist.  as much as i'd like bosepheus to get what's coming to him, i'd never be able to get around like that, what with my turnbuckle knee and all.  but that's what happens to old wrestlers.  hmm, you know what.  i think i have this mystery just about wrapped up.  great. now all we need is a fredlike trap.  i just solve these things.  aaah. aah. aaah. aaah.  rarrr.  come on, scoob, let's hide in here.  quick, turn off the light.  here, scoob, put something on so that wrestle maniac won't recognize us.  scooby: ok.  hey, i think i found an elevator.  this could be our ticket out of here.   announcer: and now, what you've been waiting ..  the texas cage match.  cage match.  rage ratch.  ooh.  arrr.  yikes. aaah.  ohh. ohh. ohh.  whoahoho.  i don't think this could get any worse.  rarrr.   ok, i was wrong.  this is worse.  rarr. rarr.  look at shaggy and scooby.  we have to do something.  do you have a plan.  no. you.  nope.  i miss fred.  look, over there.  the controls for the cage.  rarrr.  rarr. arr.  hang on.  like, what do you think we're doing.  whoaohohohoh.  unh.  uhh.  aah.  rarr.   rarr.  oh, man, i missed the trap.  and it looks like it was pretty cool.  all: freddy.   rarr.  now, let's find out who the monster is and, more importantly, what person can fill out all this fabric.  not what person, what people.  all: curt and connie crunch.  kids.  the crunch kids wanted to scare their father out of wrestling ..  like humongous hammer.  that's why they only attacked the malachi exhibit in the wrestling museumto make it look like he was the titanic twist's next target.  so that's how the monster could have 2 arms on one side of his body.  because there were 2 people inside the suit.  but how did 2 kids knock out all those huge wrestlers.  it's easy when you use the sleeping mist we found in malachi's trailer.  and they got away with it, even in spite of you meddling kids.  huh. huh.  they were right.  it is about time the old man retires before he gets hurt.  curt, connie, thanks for looking out for me.   now, this is what wrestling is all about, folks.  family.  let's celebrate like one big happy wrestling family.  unh. ohh.  it sure is nice to solve a mystery, and for such a sweet family.  you said
