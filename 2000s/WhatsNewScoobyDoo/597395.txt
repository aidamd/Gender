 on the tour today, ms. miranda wright.  right nice to meet you.  say goodbye to your title, old dude.  and finally this year's celebrity golfer is none other than cougar forest.  wow. cougar forest.  but you're a professional.  what are you doing here.  shaggy, i want to be the best golfer possible.  and in order to be the best, you've got to play the best.  and that's you.  i don't know what to say. like, i'm flattered.  plus there's an amazing water park across the street i've been wanting to check out.  hee hee hee.  looks like some tough competition this year, scoob.  time to put our game faces on.  both: grr.  all right.  let's puttputt.  whoa.  hey, garden man, get out of my way.  hey, short cake, bite your lip, if you want to make it to the 18th hole.  now, i dare say, that's an action unbecoming of a groundskeeper.  keep your sash on.  i don't plan on being a groundskeeper for long.  hey, are you meddling, kids.  we just sensed there might be a mystery around here.  and you just sensed that.  when we see that.  so what happened.  aw, nothing.  little accident on 18 last night.  it got kind of messy.  can you kids give me a hand taking that thing off.  sure.  ok, one, 2, 3.  eew.  aah.  ..she ok.  it's her allergies.  velma has severe allergic reactions.  to clowns.   it's the best present ever, a complete set of encyclopedias.  there's almost 3 whole pages on king tut alone.   hey, punkin'.  bobo here, and i saw those yucky books you got as a present.  but good news.  bobo knows how to make fun with books.  who's ready for confetti.  my encyclopedias.  hey, look. a blizzard.  whoo.  no way.  a king tut confetti flake.  whoo.  aah aah aah.  who would've thought your mom would get the only clown in the world who uses a paper shredder as a prop.  look, as long as we avoid the clown, everything will be ok.  ok.  ok.  grr.    ohh woo.  ooh.  ha.   i can't believe shaggy can focus on the hole and not be scared by the haunted house.  it's the true champs who can overcome the hazards, like a haunted house or a trembling caddy.  miss it. miss it.  both: aah ha ha ha ha.  like, this is one tough match.  i've worked up a monster appetite.  wow. the thought those 2 put into their shots.  scooby, that popcorn must be, like, deelicious.  just look at those birds go.  reah.  mmm.   dude, do you mind.  your shadow is blocking the glistening, creamy butter.  i mean fairway.  oh, man, i've got to focus.  grrr.  ha ha ha ha ha.  i think he's looking for a scooby snack.  no, i mean a real scooby snack.  ..  to the toothpick factory.   ..  a danimals vip field trip.   one lucky winner and their classmates ..  come on.  including free rides, look inside any specially marked danimalsto see if you won or with yourparent's permission go to danimals.comfor free means of entry.  many will enter,one will win.  .  danimalicious.  .  ha ha ha ha ha.  ha ha ha ha ha.  birds: caw caw caw.  shaggy, that was amazing.  you actually scared off the monster.  this puttputt tournament is the biggest day of my year.  i'm not going to let any clown school bully get in my way.  hey, where's velma.  she's having one of her clown allergy attacks.  but we're gonna need her to help solve this mystery.  like, we're gonna need everyone's help.  scooby.  mayor: i'm afraid we must suspend play until we resolve this clown hazard.  you can't do that.  i'm on a tight schedule.  augusta, the british open, pebble beach.  as mayor, i can do anything i want.  as of right now, play is suspended.  you better hope they cancel it, because i'm just getting warmed up.  she's scary.  well, gang, it looks like we've got a mystery on our hands.  it didn't sound the same coming from shaggy.  let's split up and look for clues.  come on, gang.  let's get that clown.  wait. i just remembered.  i have a very important book fair to go to.  reah. me, too.  can you believe those 2 scaredy cats.  come on.  scaredy cats.  ohh.  look. an unopened box of fruit bars.  not now, fred.  we're looking for clues.  he walks like a shaggy, he talks like a shaggyson, i am finished listening to your silly golf fantasies, gary.  your pathetic dreams of winning the mini trophy for minigolf.  your wistful fantasy of becoming spokesperson for windmills.  it could happen.  you're an embarrassment.  oh, yeah.  well, at least i don't run around wearing a sash.  i'm going on the international puttputt tour and there is nothing you can do about it.  come on.  you know, i've never actually followed shaggy.  he's fast.  if this doesn't look like a clue, i don't know what does.  jinkies.  shaggy, can we rest for a second.  these new vintage shoes are killing me.  sorry, daph, a mystery waits for no one.  here. try these.  now, this is the way to look for clues, as far away from that creepy clown as possible.  thanks to this mechanical masterpiece, miranda wright won't find herself in second place ever again.  it looks like miranda is building something suspicious.  a clue.  now, let's see.  when i normally find a clue, i tell the others, we look around, and usually bump into the monster.  quick, scooby, what do you do next to not look for clues.  batting cages.  batting cages.  all right. let's see what you got.  how about a fast one right down the pipe.  man, if i knew it was this much fun, i would've taken up not monster hunting years ago.  my turn.  i hope that was your tummy grumbling, scooby.  me, too.  ha ha ha ha ha ha.  aah.  yikes.  velma's in trouble.  let's go help her.  i've got a bad feeling about this.  if you want to wait this out in the bounce house with the other little kids, go right ahead. we've got a mystery to solve.  shaggy, what are you standing on.  must be one of those snowboard games.  look. there's another one right next to it.  ha ha ha ha.  ha ha ha ha ha.  like, it's a good thing i didn't try and stick a quarter in him.    you get nowhere and that's all you hear    and that all your friends are fools    you get nothing and you don't fit in    and they'll tell you about the news    you know you never do what you don't want to do    but you just can't do it alone    you say you're gonna do it so you better get to it    but you just can't do it alone    child, you've got to make it through the day    just another day    just another day    just another day    you know you're something special    you know you're something special    you know you're something special    they judge a book by the way you look    and they don't care what's inside    and that's all a part of growing up    it'll never hurt your pride    well, now you turn around    and you're upside down    and you've nowhere left to hide   ok, my clown nightmares, they were warm, fuzzy dreams compared to this.  i'm just glad he didn't decide to use us as toothpicks.   scooby, quick shaking like a 'fraidy dog.  the clown will hear us.  hmph.  it's cougar fo i knew cougar forest was the monster clown.  he has the perfect motive.  he can't handle coming in second, so he thought he would scare the competition away.  or worse yet, eat the competition.  what. like you don't think i'm right.  it's not that.  i'm just very creeped out that you're making so much sense.  oh.  i think it's time to make like trees ..leave.  reah. leave.  like, i think we can lose him at the pirate ship.  we're at the end of the plank.  nice going, shaggy.  hey, i'm new to this.  ha ha ha ha ha. ha ha ha ha ha.  ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.  a ha. ha ha ha.  i've got an idea.  jump on 3.  1, 2, 3.  ok. stand still and try to blend in.  maybe he won't see us.  he spotted us.  well, yeah.  any clown can tell you trees don't grow in a desert.  maybe if clowns read encyclopedias, which we know they don'twait. now's not the time to analyze.  ..  all: run.  come on, gang, to the top of that hill.  i've got a better idea.  all: aah. ohh.    there you are, shaggy.  i'm afraid i'm going to have to cancel the tournament.  you can't do that.  like, we've only played 10 holes.  has the monster been caught.  well, actually, no.  um, the giant clown ate cougar forest.  aw, too bad, too sad.  looks like i moved up to second place.  and on my way to first.  i've got to hurry up and solve this mystery before they cancel the tournament.  and, like, i've got to hurry up and find the nacho machine before they cancel nachos.   that is one fancy machine.  looks like snipper is pretty mechanically proficient.  yeah, and he's good at making things, too.  hey, gary, what are you working on.  don't tell me you don't recognize me.  uh, did we go to surf camp together.  you ruined my life.  remember me.  gary snipper.  from the first international puttputt championship.  after you beat me, i lost my edge.  i've been stuck fixing windmills and making gocarts ever since.  but i'm getting back on the tour.  no matter what my dad says.  ohh, that gary snipper.  you got your ball stuck in the volcano.  that triple bogie cost me the title.  but i'm gonna get you, shaggy.  just you watch.  looks like i've got this mystery just about wrapped up.  let's set a trap.  let's set a trhey, what just happened.  i think the bigger mystery is where's the real shaggy.  so i took the netting from the batting cage and hooked it to the windmill.  ..  turn the windmill on high by putting my ball at the on and off switch way up there.  you can do the whole solve the mystery thing, but i make the traps.  how will we lure the monster.  both: scooby and velma will act as bait.  both: no, no.  would you do it for a scooby snack.  reah. reah, reah, reah.  velma.  nice try, daphne.  i may be scared, but i'm not desperate.  fine. will you do it for a set of new encyclopedias.  on cdrom.  oh, king tut, you're back in my life.  thank you, iq,for lending me your objectsfor my catapult.   ..not now.  this won't stop me.  .. ohhh...ticket.  try goldfish grahams.  baked with whole grain and a touch of sweetness.  . the snack thatsmiles back .  goldfish.  maybe the clown circus left town.  please, oh, please, oh, please, oh, please.   don't do that.  aah. aah.  scooby, quick. go fast.   that's the signal beep.  everyone, get ready.  fore.  like, how'd i miss that.  i didn't even try to bank it.  i justaah.  whoa. aah aah aah.  aah.   aah.  ha ha ha ha. ha ha ha ha ha ha.  clown or no clown, nobody eats my friend.   )
