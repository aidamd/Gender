 were stolen and never found.  and this sure is interesting.  officer claphammer just happened to be the security guard at that museum.  ..  trouble sure does seem to follow him around.   let's get out of here.  oh, great. we're trapped.  like, don't worry, man. watch this.   we cowards always have an escape plan.   ok, gang, i think we need to split up and look for clues.  uhuh, freddy. no way.  don't worry, shaggy, this time we'll mix it up.  how about we pick teams.  velma, you and shaggy can beaptains.  ok. i'll take daphne.  right. like, freddy, you're with me.  and i'll take scooby.  so, uh, did you see the game last night.  uh, i'm not really into sports.  oh, yeah, right.  you want to get some food.  no, thanks. i'm not hungry.  ok.    next time we pair up like usual.  good plan.   daphne: who would paint their van like that.  velma: i bet i know who it belongs to.  all: aah.  and just why are you fogging up my window.  we didn't mean to disturb you, harry.  well, you did.  i was just working on a few of my own masterpieces.  wow, i thought you just collected toys.  no. i'm also a most excellent toy maker.  check this out.  " why do you call her aah.  what are all these computers for.  i'm working on designing some remote control fire ants.  remote control, huh. interesting.   aah.  is there any problem duct tape can't solve.   like, it's that creepy noise again.  this one sounds like it's coming from the back of the store.  let's check it out.  i'll stay here and guard the gumball machine.   wait up, freddy.  those terrible toys locked me in here and tied me to this chair.  and they did a good job.  these jump ropes are pretty tight.  that velveteen gorilla was really strong.  gordon, what were you doing in the store this late at night.  well, iiuhuhiuhumho ho. check this out.  i was stealing all the batteries in the store so that they couldn't be used in those dangerous toys.  isn't there a worldwide house of batteries, like, 20 feet from here.  i was going there next.  all i know is once those gates open in the morning i'm out of here.  me, too.  and until then, nothing you say is gonna make me move one inch.  oh, no. look.   scoobydoo      scoobydoo    there's a job to do    scoobydoo    trouble's brewing    scoobydoo          do you feel the chill that's in the air.       scooby    scoob scoob scoobydoo    scooby    scoobydoo    scooby    scoob scoob scoobydoo    scooby    scoobydoo    scoobydoo    now our top dog    scoobydoo    we need you    scoobydoo    one fine day now    scoobydoo

scooby    scoobydoo    scooby    scoob scoob scoobydoo    scooby    scoobydoo    scoobydoo   quick, everyone, in here.  hey, look, a silver dollar.  not now, shaggy.   huh.  like, zoinks.  we're goners.  .  i got a gusher that didn't gush .   we have a gusher that didn't gush   ig slow it down i got it, i got it     oh thank you robot child  and the land is becomi hey, look. they can't come in the water.  velma: daphne, where are you going.  to make sure those pesky playthings don't come back.  way to go, daphne. way to go.  so, like, what made those spooky soldiers go on the fritz.  i'll bet we'll find the answers right here.  what is it.  it's some kind of remote control automaton.  i found it inside the action figure.  fred: so that's what made it come to life.  and i bet we'll find similar ones in every toy in the store.  wow. this rocks.  with it, you could make any toy work by remote control.  think of the possibilities.  i still don't get how these little toys can make all that noise.  that's right. the loud booming sound.  when we were in the fountain, it sounded like it was coming from underneath us.  but what could be underneath the fountain.  the basement.  like, the only thing creepier than a deserted ..  is the basement of a deserted mall.  shaggy: food court supplies.  looks like we hit the jackpot, scoob.  reah.  gimme a boost, would ya.  .. it's hollow.  fred: this machine is a cement breaker.  that must be the loud sound we've been hearing.  daphne: why would someone be trying to break through the floor.  i think the clues are beginning to add up.  like, they are.  you're right, velma.  and i've got a plan that just might work.  with a little help from scooby.  .  ..  we found a way to trap the radio signals that have been controlling the toys.  this special collar we designed will allow scooby to sniff out radio waves and lead us to the culprit.  ..does anybody have anything they wanna say before we get started.  yes. this is a complete waste of my time.  we're all locked in here until morning.  ok, shaggy. switch him on.  nothing anybody needs to confess.  that collar is a fake.  we'll see about that.  get going, scooby.  ok.   ok. i admit it.  i did it. i built the devices.  i planted them in the toys.  it was meall me.  but why.  because i'm going to market those things and be rich.  i did this to get some free publicity, and you all took care of that for me.  ..thanks a lot.  well, you're not going to see one dime until you get out of jail.  and i'm willing to wait.  great going, scooby.  so velma, like how did you make that crazy collar.  it's just the disco dog collar deluxe.  hee hee hee hee hee.  i just don't think my little cousin is going to like it.  what's not to like.  aaaaahhh.  hey, scoob, what do you say to a littleearly morning, latenight snackeroo.  reah, reah, reah, reah, reah.  i always keep a secret stash just for emergencies.  wait a minute. harry noze didn't do it.  all: what.  i just realized who the real culprit is.  but harry confessed.  head back to the mall, fred.  i'll explain on the way.  exactly as i thought.  blast.  not you meddling kids.  he got away.  and, like, he knows this mall better than anyone.  we'll never find him.  i wouldn't be too sure about that.  ..  got it.  fred: there he is.  let's go.  waah.  oh.  grrr.  but why would harry confess to a crime he didn't commit.  velma: because harry wanted to be a great toy maker, but his own toys weren't very good.  he figured that if everyone believed he invented the devices, he would be known as the greatest toymaker of all time.  i can't believe a great military mind like mine ..  and a mangy mutt.  .  it dawned on me that we never solved the mystery of the cement breaker in the basement.  then when i saw shaggy open the secret compartment in the mystery machine, it all made sense.  right, velma.  the rampaging toys were a diversion so that no one would hear officer claphammer cutting through the basement floor.  he stole the paintings from the old art museum and hid them so he could come back for them later.  that's why the paintings were never found.  they never left the museum in the first place.  and they could have been mine.  well, we'll make sure that the paintings get back to their original owners.  that was great work, kids.  thanks, mr. bottomczek.  ..  it sure was nice of him to give you a spaceman swinton for your cousin.  it sure was.  scoobydooby doo.  animation are you sure this is new york city. yeah, absolutely.  now, if i'm not mistaken, this here is, uh, broadway.  " i wonder how far gator avenue is from broadway.  according to this map, 2,000 miles.  well, in that case, we're going to need  hello. hello, anybody there.  hello.   puddles.   come back.   hmm, hmm.  hmm.  mmhmm.  puddles.     gator man.  ..          scooby: scoobydoobydoo.    oh, i am so bored.  we haven't had a good mysteryin i don't know when.    fred,i think i've read every magazine in your house.  what's that.  no, don't.   "traps illustrated".  freddy.  i, uh, i read itfor the articles.  in fact, it's wherei got the idea for this little beauty.  who do you expect to trap outsideyour front door.    let's find out.  i got a packagefor, uh, fred jones.  hey, that's me.  ahhoh.  what is it.   like, um, i think it's a box.   it's from mr. e.  "saved this for a rainy day.  " hmmph, mr. e gives me the creeps.  fred, careful. that could be a bomb.  ooh, strike that. cute purse.  check it out" gatorsburg.  but that's impossible.  gatorsburg hasn't manufactured gator products in decades.  not since the gator mines dried up.   gatorsburg was founded back in the 1800s, when a group of prospectors searching for gold struck something much more valuableyeah. we're all gonna be rich.   gatorsburg had more alligators than anywhere in the world.  overnight, gatorsburg became a boomtown.  the town became famous for its gator skin products.  then the gator wells ran dry.  gatorsburg became a ghost town.  but, like, freddy, it says it was made in gatorsburg.   ooh, smells new.  gang, we have a mystery on our hands.  oh, sweet christmas, finally.   oh, boy.   this is what happens when a civilization is founded on an entirely gatorbased economy.  all right, gang, let's split up and look for clues.  what do you say, shaggy.  want to go clue hunting with me.  velma.  come on, not in front of scoob.   hmm.  i didn't touch it.  why, dude, how about we check out gator burger.  sounds delicious.    like, jackpot, scoobydoo.  ahh.  hmm.  both: oooh.   we need to talk.  velma, like, i would love to, but, like, i can't hear anything over the sound of my own stomach.  it's going, "like, maybe give me a triple with cheese "and chili, " you know what. forget it.  velma, wait up.  like, velm, what did i do.  nothing.  you didn't do anything.  so, me not doing anything is the thing that you're mad about.  like, why do girls have to be so confusing.  let's go, gang, there's nothing to trap here.  sent us on a wild goose chase.  ah, yeah, more like a wild gator chase.  ha ha.   hmm, that's weird.  can you tell what the problem is, fred.  you see that hole there.  that should be an engine.    you kids are in some serious trouble.   )
