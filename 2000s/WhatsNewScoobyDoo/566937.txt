happened.  this glowing green monster attacked shaggy and scooby.   you are so lying, jake.  you did not see the toxic terror.  . toxic terror..  you know, the old ghost story.  you've heard it.  nope. and we don't want to.  the story goes like this.  years ago, when the camp was being built, workers discovered a toxic waste dump.  but instead of telling the camp owner, they decided they'd cover it up by building the cabin directly on top of the fleshrotting chunk.  when they finished it, they gave it unlucky number 13.  the first night of camp, a new counselor was staying in the cabin with his pet cat.  the floor started glowing toxic green.  a strange, gooey slime slipped through the cracks, and took shape right in front of the counselor's bunk.  the toxic terror claimed its first victims on that dark night.  and now they say the toxic terror returns every year, coming for the counselors who dare to sleep in cabin 13.  like, i'm sure glad we're in cabin 18, right, scoob.  yeah. phew.  norville rogers, what is going on here.  camp director, sir, see, the toxic terror kind ofhave you been telling these kids ghost stories.  shaggy and scooby tell ghost stories.  clyde, have you met these guys.  well, there's no such thing as ghosts.  obviously this was vandalism, and if it put my new business center project behind, i'm cutting off your s'more supply.  you cretins.  like, first a terrifying toxic monster and now a possible s'mo shortage.  oh, this couldn't get any worse.  oh, no way.     i'm sure it wasn't a monster.  maybe it has to do with all this construction that clyde is doing around camp.  i swear he wants to turn this place into a resort just for adult staff.  it's got me. the toxic terror has got me.  um, shaggy. bug zapper.  oh. my bad.   ok, kids.  now before our nature hike, we need to learn about some of the dangerous plants here at camp.  who can tell me what kind of moss this is.  thanks for showing me, dennis.  . you were supposed to be scared.  aw, man.  by a common house spider.  ..so...  not scary.  yeah. not scary.  aah.  ha ha ha. ha ha ha. ha ha ha.  ha ha ha. ha ha ha. ha ha ha.     man, scoob, your flashlight sure is bright.  what kind of batteries do youyikes. the toxic terror.   aah.  like, everybody outside on the double.  one little problem with that.   like, don't panic.  us cowards always have an escape plan.   aah. aah. aah.  but like, why does that thing keep coming after me and you, scoobydoo.  i don't know.  i think i might.  .  they must have painted over it when clyde rebuilt this place.   come on, scoob, let's hide in the barn.  now all we need are a couple of fast horses and we're out of here.  huh.  scooby: golf carts.  clyde replaced the horses with golf carts.  ..  drive those lemons the heck out of here.   aah. aah. aah.   aah. aah. aah.  alex.  uhh.  hold on, gang.  yiii.  scooby. scooby.  hang in there, best buddy.  ..   ...i hope.  like, man, this couldn't get any worse.    aah. aah. aah.   hee hee hee. shaggy: scooby.  kids: scooby.    darn. the monster is getting away.  yeah. that's a shame. really.  the toxic substance is corrosive enough ..  ..the...  golf cart.  right.  well, i know someone who's not gonna like this.  we're building a worldclass day spa, and you can see the tanning tower we've constructed out on the lake.  we've even paved the trails and knocked down all the trees so you can enjoy nature from the comfort of your very own golf cart.  what happened to that golf cart.  ..  one of those brats ran off with it last night.  the little urchins will be long gone when we open kichihaha resort and relaxation center.  poor shaggy and scooby.  if we're going to help them out, we've got to find out what's going on.  if only we could find some clues.  alex, look out.  you're gonna have to do better than that, dennis.  aw, man.  ha ha ha. ha ha ha. ha ha.  hey, come back.  ha ha. ow.  ha ha ha. ha ha ha. beat you.  race you. ha ha ha. ha ha ha.  i'm gonna get you. ha ha ha.    you gonna finish that.  shaggy, aren't you excited.  no. i win this contest every year.  no. my cabin, your cabin.  we're going on a campout tonight.  you mean instead of sleeping in my toxic terror trap of a cabin, i have to sleep outdoors in the creepy no night light and sight darkness.  keep telling yourself, the gang is somewhere creepier.  the gang is somewhere creepier.  did you guys hear that.  a campout.  ..   and look for clues.  then maybe we can help shaggy and scooby.  "  kid: hey, watch it.  oops. sorry.   come on, guys. we're almost at terror hill.  tttterror hill.  the gang is somewhere creepier.  the gang is somewhere creepier.  rrarr.  yii. aah.  rrarr.  rrarr.  rrarrehhhhhhoh. ha ha.  nice try, dennis.  where does he get all those cool costumes.  . i don't believe it.  this used to be the best spot in all of camp to see the stars.  ooh. this time, clyde has gone too far.  this is like the greatest monster keepingaway night light i've ever seen.  yeah. night light.  for once, scoob and i are gonna get a good night's sleep.  shh.  here.  thanks, ernie, but it's a little dark and i kind of like not bumping into things.  they track the toxic ..  ..  monster.  right. monster.  ok, now this is cool.  ernie, you may be weird but you sure are smart.  come on.  look at this. a diving suit. it's brand new.  what would it be doing in a dusty old place like this.   like, what is it, scoob.  look.  there's glowing green light coming from behind that tree.  do you think maybe someone built an allnight diner out there.   looks like the kitchen's closed.  run for it, scoobydoo.   have you ever have one of those days that had you feel now    nothin' ever goes right, makes you start thinkin' 'bout what you want    and everything that you need, yeah    and then you start losin' control    you see the tunnel around, you got a head start    now i'm tryin' to figure out why you play your games    you know will never be won    think about you is all i can do    but if you take a good look at yourself, you're gonna see that i'm strong now    it's all about you   the toxic terror.   i'm finally breakin' the news    you got to give it all up to show me that you're gonna be strong now   shaggy: come on, kids. let's hide up here.    whoa. whoa. whoa.       clyde: hey, what's going on out there.  butbut this can't be.  not my tanning tower.  now where are all the guests gonna get deep, dark, tropic tans.  you. you kids did this.  like, no way, mani mean, sir.  it was the toxic terror.  still blaming this on ghost stories.  i've already made up my mind.  i'm shutting down this summer camp.  . no, please. don't.  well, you have to admit, it is pretty unsafe around here, what with all these accidents and all.  we wouldn't want anything to happen to you children, would we.  you want to turn our summer camp into a place for grownups.  camp is our favorite place in the whole world.  .. i'm touched.  not. now get to bed.  i can't believe clyde is going to close the camp.  i can't believe we let down shaggy and scooby.  i really thought we could help them out.  maybe in our haste to decipher this enigma, ..we...  screwed up.  exactly.  shaggy: come on, gang.  alex: shaggy. scooby. what are you guys doing.  solving this mystery.  ghost or no ghost, the camp is our favorite place, too.  all right.  now scoob and i have seen a lot of mysteries being solved.  that's got to count for something.  and the first thing to do if you want to solve a mystery is locate the creepiest, spookiest place around.  well, that'd be cabin 13.  man, i liked this whole saving camp idea better before you mentioned that.  me, too.  so what do we do next to solve a mystery, shaggy.  is there a basement to this place.  scoob and i are always being chased in spooky basements.  there is.  oh, lucky us.  hey, wait a minute.  we're in the basement of cabin 13.  like, did you have to remind us.  scoob and i were in our happy places.  i was in aruba.  no, what i'm saying is that we're underground where the toxic dump would have been.  but there is no toxic waste here.  then the toxic terror is a fake.  well, somebody might want to tell him.   aah. aah.   he's cutting through the supporting beams.  is that bad.   forget it. i answered my own question.  like, run.  uhh. uhh. uhh.   we made it.  yeah, but so did the toxic terror.  aah. aah. aah.  introducingaveeno ultracalming with active naturals feverfew.  ..  ..  to strengthen skin and

now, these are all the places the toxic terror has attacked.  the corral with the new golf carts, the new tanning tower, ..  and it didn't attack us here in the old tree house.  exactly.  exactly what.  ..  a monster trap.  leave that to me and scoob.  we have a lot of experience watching traps being put together.  you really think this is going to work.  as long as scoob and i are live bait, it can't miss.  scooby: yeah. live bait.  now all we have to do is stroll around until he shows up.  like, hey, it already worked.  we're good. reah. too good.   yii. aah.  hey, what about our trap.  the net just seemed a little less crazy.  . dennis..  hah. i got you. i finally got you.  you guys were so scared.  you should have seen the looks on your faces.  but dennis couldn't have done it.  it doesn't make sense.  all the clues pointed tozoinks. 2 toxic terrors.  run.    yaah.  ooh. aah. ooh. yah.  never doubt the power of a crazy trap.  fred sure would be proud.  who's fred.  got me.  ok. let's try this again.  . grey..  i'm sorry, shaggy.  i wasn't after you and scooby.  i was trying to destroy the new buildings around camp.  you two were just always in the wrong place at the wrong time.  man, that's like the story of our lives.  you said it.  well, i would have gotten away with it if it weren't for those meddling kids in your cabin.  but what is this crazy glowing goop.  this is the toxic moss i was telling everyone about in nature class.  shaggy: so dennis made his own toxic suit rrar. because he wanted to scare us.  he saw the monster was the only thing that did that.  but grey, why did you do all this.  to scare clyde away.  shaggy, people always want to change things in the world.  they say it's to make progress.  but sometimes things are perfect just the way they are.  this camp didn't need to change.  like, clyde still hasn't seen the toxic terror, has he.    aah.   aah.   aah.       aah.   aah.  ha ha ha ha. ha ha ha ha.   now this is more like it, right,
