 so, malcolm, you do know that energy savers last 6 times longer than ordinary light bulbs.  this isn't my room. it's baron davis'.  baron davis the basketball player.  this is his room. yep.  interesting because we have baron davis right here.  baron, do you live here.  no.  i don't mean that baron davis.  announcer: millions of kidsare using their energy wisely.  huh.  . .  . .  . .  wow.  i know.   new koolaid fun fizz.  drop it. watch it. drink it.  wow. that was too close.  quick, he's making a run for it.  we've gotta follow him.  shaggy sure walks a lot faster with 20foot legs.  but hopefully not for much longer.  the sun's coming up.  he should resume his human form.   just 5 more minutes.  velma: shaggy, wake up.  breakfast.  so i guess you were kidding about breakfast, huh.  hey, i'm surprised you're still hungry.  we watched you devour half of tokyo last night.  good thing i took the liberty of packing emergency outfits.  i guess this is ittime to turn me in.  oh, no. not a chance. no.  we're far from home, i'm turning into a monster every night, and we don't have a friend to turn to.  that's not quite true.  there is one person who can help us.   hmm. velma, thank goodness.  yes, of course i'll help, but you've got to be very careful.  i'll meet you this afternoon.  kaminari gate at osakusa temple.  it's secluded and easy to find.  lieutenant tanaka will never think of looking for you there.  fred: i got to hand it to you, daph, only you could create these great disguises with just a stapler and black mascara.  ah, there it is.  osakusa temple.  hmmph.  hey, there's professor pomfrit.  let's go make contact.  but gang, play it real cool.  .. professor pomfrit.  yes. it's us.  fred, daphne, velma, shaggy, and scooby.  we're in disguise.  tanaka: you call that a disguise.  all i had was mascara and a stapler.  it's a trap. get out of here, kids.  dogbot, super jumbo popcorn, stat.  take cover.  this is popcorn.  after them. hurry.  ruhoh.  dogbot, can you turn into something that'll get us out of here.  yikes.  ugh.  like, so sleepy.  mustn't sleep.  turn into monster.   huh.  hey, check out this tiny little car.  zoinks. oh, no.  like, i'm a big giant monster.   i'm all alone.  i'm all alone.  what a bummer, right, scoob.  reah. bummer.   oh, no. scoobydoo.  the ancient one's curse got you, too.  velma: not quite.  huh. you're all giants.  oh, man, how are we all gonna fit into the mystery machine.  don't worry, shag. we're not big.  tokyo's just little.  velma: we're standing in the middle of a detailed model of tokyo.  we followed dogbot to this abandoned movie studio.  they used to make movies about giant monsters here.  this proves you're not the monster at all.  like, if not me, who or what's been running around in size 900 sneakers.  something tells me we'll have our answer when we find out who ordered dogbot to bring you here.  and the best place to get to the bottom of that mystery is right back where we startedat the robotics factory.  now, all we have to do is search this place forthere's elliot kissing up to dr. onodera.  why, that chicken.  maybe elliot knows the truth about the monster.  we better ask him.  or better yet, me. uhuh, him.   zoinks.   now let's see who's really behind the attack of the oot shaggy.  all: professor pomfrit.  i hated to admit it, but i knew it must be the professor.  the monster didn't show up until we did.  he saw the conflict between the ancient one and onodera and used the giant monster legend to frame shaggy.  when shaggy ate the cursed pizza, pomfrit rigged dogbot to respond to his ..  and get the sleeping shaggy away from the action so we thought he was the monster.  but, like, why.  because everything he had should be mine.  why's he rich when i'm just an underpaid high school teacher.  somebody's favorite high school teacher.   you're a brilliant girl, velma.  you were my prize student, and i used your ingenious invention for my own selfish ends.  i'm very sorry.  he would've gotten away with it, too, if it weren't for those meddling kids.  but, what of the ancient one.  surely he had a hand in all of this.  there's no such thing as the ancient one.  ..  a spirit.  whatever he was, i'm sure he'll be pleased to know that i've decided to build a new wharf somewhere else.  after all this, i don't want to see anything destroyed.  here, elliot, a dog you won't be allergic to.  what. you're giving him to me.  my own dog. wow.  iheh. thanks, velma.  that was really sweet of you, velma.  but aren't you going to miss dogbot.  i may have given dogbot a supersized brain, but that just can't compete with scoobydoo's supersized heart.  all: aww.  scoobydoobydoo.      well, paris was exciting, but hong kong really
