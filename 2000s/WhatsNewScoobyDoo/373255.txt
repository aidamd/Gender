admired your work, and i was wondering if, you know, your really big brain wouldn't mind sharing just a little bit of information with me.  please.  well, ok.  we're workin' on a secret project for the military.  really.  now what do you say you give me some information, like your phone number.  ew.  it's coming from over here.  where'd you learn to do this.  never did. but i have a good ear for

ideas to show you.   hey, someone's workin' on our tour bus.   oh, hey, seb.  i found a mechanic to help us get back on the road.  you boys mind not standin' there.  uh, sorry, mr. mechanic guy.

invisible madman.  and he kidnapped david.  it seems that our mystery isn't as random as we thought.  this invisible intruder is specifically targeting the guys in the band.  gibby: velma. velma.  ooh.  ..  unfortunately.   hey, velma, i have something i think you might be interested in.  it's a videotape of the invisible madman.  i shot it myself.  gibby, how can you have a videotape of something that's invisible.  well, come back to my place, and i'll show you.  i thought we could get some popcorn, maybe some cheese dip.  oh, that's it.  gibby has to be the invisible madman.  please. please.  but if gibby's it, i wonder who's driving that snow plow.  run.  all: aah.   all: no, scooby. stop, scooby.   sorry.  is everyone ok.  something tells me they're not.  both: help. help. help.  oh, no. chuck and seb.  but that means i'm the only one left.  well, have you ever thought about a solo career.  heh. just asking.  i don't get it. i was sure it was gibby.  but he was there when the invisible madman showed up.  but so was zeke and that jackofalltrades.  then it couldn't be any of them.  the only one who hasn't been around when the invisible madman attacked is eve delaffei.  you, daphne, and shaggy and pierre go back to eve's cabin and see what you can find.  what about scooby.  i've got a special job for him.  oh.  ok, scoob. see if you can pick up the scent.   rowrhee.  wait for me.  i meant the scent of the invisible madman.  oh.   so, couldn't stay away from my yummy designs, could you.  actually, we were wondering about your whereabouts for the past 2 hourswhen we were attacked by the invisible madman.  i don't know anything about aand what would this be.   that's nothing.  hey, i can see myself.  check it out.   or not.  daphne: the invisible madman has pierre.  but that's impossible.  eve was supposed to be the invisible maddaphne: hey. what happened to the lights.   he's gone.   what is it, scooby.  ooh.   unh.  unh.      "g". "g".  what are you looking at.  " brook thinks it's a message from gilbert.  he must be near by.   swim for it.  huh. what.   uh. ohh.  ooh.  ohh.  ha ha ha.  you are slimed, brother.  and now, brother, you are slimed.  nice to see swimmington loosen up.  yeah. he should get imed more often.  flavor blasted goldfish crackers.  always baked and really cheesy.  . the snack that smiles back .  goldfish.  fred: huh. hey.  what is that.  five skull fire sauce.  we didn't have smelling salts.  so i had to improvise.  how did i get here.  it was all thanks to scoobydoo.   what's that sound.  ..  coming from that safe.  unh.  there's no way.  that's gotta be 2 feet thick with titanium casing and a magneticahem. excuse me.  better use the platinum card.  whoa. thanks for rescuing us.  now did you get a good look at the invisible madman when he trapped you well, no, actually. because he was, you know.  oh. invisible. right.  zeke, jack hunter, gibby and eve all have perfectly good alibis.  so where does that leave us.  with the answer to this mystery.  the only thing left to do ture the madman.  and i've got a simple plan.  since the invisible madman has been targeting you guys, all you have to do is start playing, and he'll show up.  no way. we're not gonna be live bait.  ha ha ha. i knew i liked you guys.  reah.  um, would you do it for some scooby snax.  scooby snax. what are those.  yuck. huh. dog treats.  let's do it. 1, 2, 3, 4.    ok, fred.  like, now would be a good time for your trap.  fred: got him.  daphne:..  that.  then there's always the old standbyrun.   maybe    i'm just not good enough for you    and maybe    i just don't wanna be like you    and maybe i just don't wanna know    how low you're ready to go    i'm not gonna change    you  whoa, you don't, you don't    you don't, you don't    you don't mean anything to me    you don't, you don't, you don't, you don't    you don't mean anything to me    you're what i never wanna be    tell me      and tell me      'cause maybe you always bring me down    i'm sick of being pushed around    i'm not gonna change    you can't make me    whoa, you don't, you don't, you don't, you don't    you don't mean anything to me    you don't, you don't, you don't, you don't   anything to me    you're what i never wanna be   all: zeke zillion.  shaggy: but, like, i thought that toady of a roadie had an airtight alibi.  in fact, everyone here did, and that's when it dawned on me.  the invisible madman had to be more than one person.  gibby was working for jack's company, and they had a secret military contract to invent this invisible camouflage suit.  and eve used her fashion skill to make the reflective cloth theyeeded.  so, like, everyone did it.  precisely. but what i wanna know is why.  because we have a band, too.  we thought if we got simple plan out of the way, we could replace them at the festival in montreal.  hit it, guys.   what do you think of that fat groove, velma.  oh, brother.  well, you blokes, i'd say we rock.  the only rock your gang should learn is the jailhouse rock.  thanvery much.    oh, no. it's the invisible madman.    )
