"shaggy said this. shaggy said that.  "shaggy solved another mystery.  " that's all i've heard from rachel nonstop for the past year.  all my awards, my platinum albums, nothing.  do you have any idea what it's like living ..  thought the easiest way to ruin the memory of rachel's previous boyfriend would be to frame him for a crime.  he knew from rachel we were coming back home, so he conceived the lovers' lane disappearances.  he hired extras to play the rest of us and a hollywood makeup artist to create the masks and costumes, which explains the industrialstrength glue we found in the woods.  he sent us secret admirer valentines to get us out here, then he used our signatures from the ones he sent special delivery to forge that confession letter.  wait a minute. let me get this straight.  ..  ..  i can't believe you would do something like this.  that wassosweet.  gahhgg. gahhgg.  so where are all the missing teenagers.  follow us, officers.  new danimals coolision.  dylan. two danimals flavors at once.  yea, you could do that.  or try new danimals coolision tubes.  coolision tubes.  yep, one flavor on the left, one flavor on the right.  make both flavors collide for an awesome new taste.  genius.  new danimals coolision.  ..  danimalicious.  now that's a blast of fruity flavor.  both: coolision. get your blast on.  mentioned he'd bought a cabin on the outskirts of town.  he purposely let sheila go so she'd be sure to identify us to the police.  and i would have gotten away with it, too, if it hadn't been for you meddling kids.   oh, my gosh. it's jc chasez.  aah. aah.  back off. he's mine.   hey.  well, this sure has been a interesting valentine's day.  daphne: if by "interesting" you mean "crummy," then, yes, i agree.  an extra. ugh.  was sarah michelle gellar too busy.  i don't know about you guys, but i sure am ready for another road trip.   love, man.  what are you gonna do. ha ha.  it's like all the songs say: "yada, yada, yada.  "love will give you a headache.  " ahhooga.  man, i think i'm in love.  yeah. me, too.  scoobydoobydoo.  happy valentines to you.     all: whoa.           whoohoohoo.  jeepers.  that was seriously scary.  come on. let's go again.  uh...let's not and say we didn't.  i'm with daphne.  the ghost coaster is by far the scariest ride at the halloween carnival.  haha. are you kidding.  like, that ride put the "easy" in "cheesy." yeah. oh, easy.   are you sure you weren't just a little bit scared.   by all the bloodsucking vampires.  howling werewolves.  and wicked witches.   hahaha. nice try, gang, but scoob and i aren't scared of any of those phony old frights.  yeah. phony frights.   come on.  not even on halloween night.  ha. are you kidding.  like, halloween is the one night when you know everything is fake.  just take a look around.  it's nothing but wannabe witches and goofball ghosts as far as the eye can see.   yumyum.   shaggy: hahaha. but i got to admit, a holiday invented just to eat candy can't be all bad.   freddy: hey. check it out.  velma : this ought to be good.  i'll grab tickets before they sell out.   ah.   like, beat that, scoob.  scoobydoobydoo.   both: scooby.    confounded mutt.   look what you've done. i'm soaked.   oh.   wetdog smell.  freddy: oh, wow.  we know you.  you're the amazing krudsky.  we were just on our way to catch your act.  act.  the halloween spectacular is no mere act.  now, out of the way.  i must go blowdry my cummerbund.  so, like, i guess we'll be seeing you inside.  three magic words: "no dogs allowed." huh.   can you believe the nerve of this guy.
