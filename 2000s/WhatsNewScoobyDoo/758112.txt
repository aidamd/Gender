saying "the greek godsshall bring chaos " man, i read the brochure,and nowhere did it talk about getting cursedby the local loonies.   this miniature parthenon sure will look good in my thermometers from around the world collection.  classy.  this thing is dangerous.  you know the centaur will continue to attack us as long as we have it.  it's mine. give it back.  hey, scoob, check it out.  ah, wise choice, my friend.  wise choice.  that is one powerful amulet.  powerful. ha ha ha.  like, tell me it keeps monsters away, and you've got a sale.  that's exactly what it does.  it is an ancient greek medallion that keeps away all kinds of monsters.  whoa. imagine the odds, eh, scoob.  oh, boy.  it's not here.  where is it.  .. with the ruby.  ha. it is just a worthless trinket.  i have many more.  that was no trinket. it was real.  now, where is it.  ..ii sold it... to him.  ..  oh, no. my purse is missing.  don't you have a bunch of them.  7 purple, 3 green, a totally awesome burgundy.  but that was the only one i brought to greece.  so, like, where's the concession guy.  shaggy, it's not a ball park.  this is the ancient theater of dionysus where the greek tragedies were originally performed.  they don't havefeta cheese on a stick.  get your feta right here.  wow. does he have any baklava.  like, man, scoob, those ancient greeks were way ahead of their time.  this is better than the movies.   who knew they had such great special effects.  rrrrrr.  talk about interactive.  this mythological beast looks so real.  ..  i think it is real.  what makes you say that.  aah. aah.   what are you looking for.  how to say run in greek.  but that's one phrase you don't have to translate.  shaggy: gangway.  like, easy for him to say.  hey. i almost forgot about my lucky amulet.  wow. this amulet really works, scoob.  it saved us from the monster.  oh, raggy.  better keep this thing in a safe place.  ..  .. on our hands.  man, i gotta start working out.  that old guy at the airport put a curse on us.  like, what's the mystery. we're cursed.  i don't believe in curses.  ..  at the historical society of athens.  it has the body of a horse but the head of a man.  do you think you can help us, major portsmith.  it's portsmouth, and of course i can.  there's a very rational explanation for all this.  see. i told you.  the mythological creatures are real.  excuse me. what.  i've spent my entire career trying to prove the myths are real.  no one would believe me. no one.  ..  oh ho. thank you, kids.  thank you.  this is what i have been waiting my whole life to hear.  does he even work here.  we have to start asking for credentials.   isn't that the scary looking guy from the airport.  he's back to curse us again.  well, you have to admire his dedication.   .. a gym membership.  for christmas.  write it down.  wow. the ancient acropolis.  this is amazing.  hey, scoob, check it out.  pfft.   ha ha ha ha.  not so tough when you're made out of stone, are ya.  like, not now, scoob. i'm on a roll.   oh, hi.   ha ha ha ha.  like, thanks, man. you're a lifesaver.  now give to me what i came for.   all right. oh.  i don't believe it.  first the scary centaur, now the old maniac moped guy.   uhuh.  don't worry, gang.  i'll get us firstclass accommodations.   looks like this place could use a daphne doover.  ..  some deodorizer.  oh. i forgot. i lost my purse.  sorry, guys.      ow.   velma: it's the island of crete.  anyplace that's centaurfree sounds good to me.  isn't that major portsmith from the historical society.  it's portsmouth.  let's follow him and find out what he's up to.  great. now what are we going to do.  just leave that to me and my trusty phrase book.  one of us has to steal that book.  i'm serious.  huh.  zoinks. it's the centaur.  ah.  wow. that was amazing.  it sure was. we trapped the centaur.  i meant the brakes on this car.  kids.  oh, kids, there you are.  have you seen it. have you seen the centaur.  we sure have. it's trapped right over there.  inside the minotaur's maze. ha ha ha ha.  good show.  the beast will never get out of that twisting, turning trap.  since we've trapped the centaur, i guess our work here is done, scoob.  time to go back to athens and sample some hummus.  reah. hummus.  not so fast, you two.  we need someone to go into the maze and flush out that centaur.  ha ha ha. like, no way.  scoob and i are not interested.  uhuh. no way.  would you do it for someoops. the scooby snax are in my purse.  do you guys take ious.  don't worry, scoob, old buddy.  i tied a piece of string at the entrance to the maze.  that way, when we want out, we just follow it back, see.  .. ha ha.  the string's been cut.  uhoh.  ..does that white stone totally plain wall look familiar to you.  no.  yeah. like, me neither.  we're lost, scoob, lost in the minotaur's maze.  like, thanks, man.  the centaur.  run for it.  it sounds like shaggy and scooby are in trouble.  it makes sense that we're in ancient greece, scoob.

him.  what happened. did you see the centaur.  the hoofmarks on my back are a fashion statement.  oh, blast it all.  i was guarding the back exit and i missed it.  oh. my life's dream. when will it happen.  .  ever notice that the good major is never around when the centaur appears.  and you would be.  i am lysander demas, the rightful owner of that amulet.  my lucky amulet. like, no way, man.  you have a lucky amulet, shaggy.  lucky. oh, no, my rumpled young friend.  this is not lucky at all.  this is the amulet of the centaur.  it doesn't protect you.  in fact, it attracts the beast.  so that's wh mythological monster's been chasing us.  but if the amulet attracts the centaur, then why are you trying to get it.  because. you see those markings on the side.  if you take this amulet to the temple of light on santorini, it will show you the way.  the way to where.  man, santorini sure is pretty, i can't believe it's this hot, especiallyt night.  aieee.  like, it's the centaur. run.   like, it's the old, maniac moped guy. run.  that way.   like, fine, you cursed us. we get it already.  he's trying to return your purse.  all:.  wow. my purse.  in my phrase book, "the greek gods shall bring chaos to your lives," is right under, "i'm trying to return your " heh.  ooh, my bad.  freddy, how do you say "thank you" in greek.  demas to translate for us.  no. i'm afraid there isn't time.  we have to reach the temple of light while the moon is still out.  ok. now what.  there.   velma: there.  the entrance to atlantis must be on that island.  it's here, it's here.  pretty exciting, huh, major.  . now, where did he gaah. aah.  we've got to do something to get past this rampaging rodeo reject.  well, having my purse back means that i also have my makeup kit.    whooooh. raaaah.  the centaur crashed through the door to atlantis.  but, like, hey, there's nothing there.  well, i guess the mystery of atlantis will always be just thata mystery.  but we still haven't found out who's behind the mask of this menacing myth.  this can only be one personthe only person who was conveniently absent whenever the centaur attackedmajor portsmouth.  what. who's this.  we haven't even met her.  we don't even know who she is.  she's my assistant susie smythe.  and how was i supposed to know that.  no way. foul. this one does not count.  but why did you do this.  because the entrance to atlantis was supposed to be my discovery.  i would have been famous if it weren't for you meddling kids.  well, i think you'll be quite famouswith the greek authorities.  i was just at the boat, getting my camera.  did i miss anyoh. oh, my.  i knew it. i knew it.  it's real. it's all real.   oh, the wonder of it all.  ha ha ha ha.  you think we should tell him.  nah. nah.  but this

live superpower dogs from another galaxy.   uh, stretchomutt, i am a superpower dog from another galaxy.   boy, nobody tells me nothing.   get ready to see the dog star spaceship.   wow.   and these are the dog stars: brainy barker, bulldog, tusky husky, paw pooch, tale terrier, an  how you doing.   well, say something.     i guess he's excited to meet you all.   there we were, cornered by a giant flea the size of a moon buffalo.   whoa.  tale terrier, what'd you do.  show me. show me.   well, i just lassoed its antennas and yanked it on over to paw pooch.   and i caught him, gave him a spin, and handed him off to bulldog.   and then i took him for a little ride.   whoa. whoohoo.  then what happened.   things took a turn for the worse for monsieur flea.   whoohoo.   things were

mechanicat.  and judging from your splotchy appearance, brainy, you've already received my special delivery.   yeah.  you ought to change your name from brainy to dotty.    why did you send us these germs.   snooky and i are planning to drop by for a visit.  consider it a host's gift.   i think flowers or candy would be more appropriate.  don't you.   oh, and by the way, i'm bringing along my latest batch of cat bots.   i don't care how many of those windup toys you bring.  i can take them.   oh, really.  hmm.  kryptonite ray.   still think you can take my cat bots. )
