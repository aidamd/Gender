 don't mind him.  nt of his sleepwalking.  let's go, dad. it's nap time.   so ernest is a sleepwalker.  interesting.  and suspicious, but we still got to find shaggy and scooby.  we need a plan.  yeah, we needohh.  hey, that's my cue. let's split up.  you don't mind searching alone, do you, fred.  in this haunted factuh, yeah, sure. i'm cool with that.   so that's why the power went off.  it was on a timer.  which means anyone could have set it.  hmm.  i'm at the vault.  the secret recipe will soon be ours.   hey, it's that gift shop girl.  huh.  hmm.  aaaah.  mmm.  if i'm dreaming, don't pinch me.  huh.  this time i said don't pinch me.   shaggy: zoinks.  somebody wants to make a meal out of us.  ohhhhh.   help.  excuse me, mister.  meister, and this lab is off limits.  oh, sorry.  i'm looking for a dog and a lanky teen.  have you seen them.  you're after the secret recipe, aren't you.  no, no, no, no, no, no.  although, it would be neat to find out.  i bet it has jelly in it or bacon or maybe guacamole.  i knew it. you're a spy.  all of you are.  and as soon as i tell ernest, he's going to go mad.  you mean like crazy mad.  oh, yah.  and if i were you, i'd watch my step.   ohohohhh.  uhh.   whew. ahh.  boy, are we glad to see you two.  .   he won't find us in here.   aw, come on.  is there any hiding place this monster doesn't know.    whoa  talk about a dream turning into a nightmare.  we're gonna drown in snack batter, scoob.   help.   zoinks.  i'd recognize that zoinks anywhere.  shaggy and scooby are in trouble.  let's hurry.  oh. we're too late.  where did the batter go.  oh, thank goodness you're both ok.  not to mention, ahhhh, well fed.  hee hee hee.   why is it every time the monster appears ernest and penelope are gone.  has anyone seen them.  meister, and let me tell ya, he's very protective of that recipe.  i also found this mask.  you won't believe who it belongs to.  trudy was wearing it.  the girl from the gift shop.  she seems to bking around the factory.  so maybe she's behind all of this.  what do you think, velmvelma.  hmm.  2 hazardous material suits are missing.  want to bet our monster is using one of them.  penelope: aah.  oh, thank goodness you're here.  what happened.  my father was sleepwalking again, so i went looking for him, but the monster jumped me.  i've been tied up ever since.  i think it's time we turned the tables on this monster once and for all.  great, and while you 3 are turning the tables, scoob and i will be eating at one.  actually, my plan includes you two.    and then we'll wait in the shadows for the monster to appear while shaggy and scooby act as bait.  like, isn't it somebody else's turn.  guys, you're forgettingwe're looking for a monster covered in scooby snax.  you two have noses like bloodhounds for that stuff.   that suddenly reminds me, i'm catching a cold.  ..  ahchoo. ahchoo.   oh, man, i smell something good, which can only be bad.  keep an eye out for that monster, scoob.  .. it's here.  it's circling us, scoob.  hunting us down.  luring us into a deliciously vicious    quick in here.  ..oh.  let me outta here.  fred: ahha. just as i suspected.  trudy's a spy.  she's been trying to steal the secret recipe for a rival factory.  well, there you have it.  mystery solved.  let's get back to bathing in batter.  wait. didn't trudy just start working here.  and hasn't that monster been around for months.  velma, you think too much. let's go.  but if trudy's not the monster, ..   that's the monster.  i bet that monster's mean mr. meister.  that's easy for you to say.  i wouldn't be so sure.  all:.   ohpenelope.  you're the monster.  i'm afraid she is.  ..  but i knew she was lying when we found snack batter in her office.  yet not one drop was on her.  that's because penelope's allergic to scooby snax.  the hazmat suit was to protect her from getting a rash.  not to mention it made her look a lot more menacing.  well, i would have gotten away with it if it weren't for you pestering kids.  that's "meddling" kids, " but why, penny.  why do it at all.  i wanted to scare away thieves and protect our secret recipe.  i was only looking out for the family business.  oh, don't you fret.  now that you've solved our monster problem, i don't have to close the factory.  i'd say that deserves a reward.   like a lifetime supply of scooby snax.  ha ha ha ha.  dig in, kiddos.  whoohoo.  ha ha ha ha. ha ha ha ha.  i guess a lifetime supply doesn't go as far as it used to.  i can fix that.  hop aboard.  hee hee hee hee hee hee.  scoobysnackydoo.  that's the
