yeah, well, chalk it upto rest stops, gas stops, and fast foodscooby snack stops.  we just wantedto make sure we had enoughfor those secret 6 puppies.  i got to say,those are some lucky dogs, winning enough moneyin that dog show to buy their own farm.  fred. look out.   scooby: roah.  that crazed tractor driver cut us off on purpose.   ok, there's absolutely nothing to panic about.  aah.  didn't mean to scare you folks.  we can you help us.  mr. b. why i'm his neighbor, farmer p.  just go straight ahead and you'll get back on the road.  2 more miles, you'll run right into the farm.  but before you head out, i should warn you.  something horrible always happens at that farm.  always.  yike. yike.  have a nice night.  thththanks for not scaring us.  fred: i'm guessing this is mr. b's farm.  well, i don't see any trouble here.  aah.  ..rrr.  just greeting the puppies.  everyone believes that, right.  sure. sure, fred.  like, hey, there, mr. b.  great to see all of you again.  ok, ok, you pups.  settle down, maize, flax, knox, 14karat, jingles, and blingbling.  ha ha ha ha.  blingbling, do i have to say everything twice with you.   why do they have all those numbers on their tags.  uh, that's so our farmhands can tell them apart.  farmhands.  we haven't seen any nds around here.  well, the others were too darned scared to stay.  jonas.  everyone, meet jonas sulk, my numberone farmhand, the only one loyal enough to stick around.  the workers were doing their jobs when a demon farmer came out of the fields, slashing and hacking away everything in sight with his monstrous sickle.  yes, and apparently it was terrifying enough to leave me without any workers.  ever work a farm before.  uh, let's see.  ..  never.  oh, i'm sure we can figure things out.  like, no, we can't.  there's a demon around with a monstrous sickl and if anyone knows what monstrous means, it's me.  and me.  relax, shaggy.  we'll just have to keep our eyes wide open.  daphne: i don't get it.  how can we collect eggs if the chickens haven't laid any.  we need to encourage them, that's all.  and how do we do that.  here, eggy, eggy, eggy.  hee hee hee hee.   yikes. here it comes.  the horrible thing that farmer warned us about.  aah. aah. aah.  jonas.  i been watchin' you people.  you're never gonna get chickens to lay eggs that way.  well, what way would you do it.  i'd use one of my inventions.  an invention to lay eggs.  that's pretty odd.  and "here, eggy, eggy" isn't.  look, i'm not used to sharing my inventions with strangers, but you folks need help.  ok, so the chickens are relaxed now, but i don't see any eggs.  ..  ..  1.   ooh. hoo hoo hoo.  yum. breakfast is served.  this is my best invention.  " i had a gotractor, too, but somebody stole it.  that thing could chase away anything in its path.  maybe even the other farmhands.  like, 99.  like, 100.  here we come, ready or not.  boo. aah.  hee hee hee hee.  rarrr.  rarrr.  help. that horrible tractor guy is in there.  jeepers. where are the puppies.   in there, too.  like, what the hay.  that's the only thing that's here.  reah, hay.  fred: here they are. they all look ok.  here's something elsea razorsharp lethal weapon.  looks like we have a mystery to solve here down on the farm.    and the streets [) ..  of this balanced breakfast.

i'm frida flora from the local animal safety group.  i got a tip that there are some puppies in danger.  i'm here to take them to a safe place.  are you sayin' my farm isn't safe.   i'm taking these puppies now.  these puppies belong right here, lady.  you have no legal right to take them away.  if you people care more about a piece of paper than the safety of these puppies, i'll get a court order, but i will be back.  thanks, velma.  but i have a feeling she wants somethin' more than the puppies' safety.  like what.  this farm.  how could she expect to get this farm.  easy.  it was bought in the puppies' name, so whoever controls the puppies, controls the farm.  velma: so if somebody wanted the farm, they could also be trying to scare everyone off of it.  like, there are too many freaky things happening around here.  let's get out of here, right now.   mr b.: dinner.  ok, right after that.  , do you think someone's going after the farm or after the puppies.  could be either.  the pups are grand champions with a big, fat bank account.  when we bought this place, i had jonas put surveillance cameras all over just to keep an eye on 'em.  video cameras.  hmm, that might help us.  can we watch the tapes.  good idea, freddy.  maybe we'll get a clue as to just who this demon farmer is.  you know, i've never watched a video on the side of a barn before.  i've never watched one without popcorn.  uh, mr. b., where's the popcorn.  we don't have any.  ran out yesterday. no popcorn here.  none at all.  what part of "no popcorn" don't you understand.  the part about movies with no popcorn.  here, have a pretzel.   no popcorn here.  yet there's a huge cornfield.  i have yet to see a pretzel field.     fred: that must be jonas's stolen tractor.  velma: let's see who's driving it.  yiii. yiii.  rarr. rarr.  rarrr.  man, that was close.  i saw my entire life flash before my eyes, mostly sandwiches and ghosts.  fred: hey, what do you got there, blingbling.  it's the same exhaust pipe jonas designed for the plow.  must have fallen off that tractor.  hey.  jonas said his tractor was stolen, but he could still be the one riding around and scaring the puppies.  hey, hold on there.  jonas is a loyal employee and would have no reason to want to harm my puppies.  like, why is a nice guy like him protecting a creepy guy like jonas.  on the other hand, he did give us pretzels with the movie.  it's just wrong.  gee, is it time to split up already.  ok, we'll follow the tire tracks while shaggy and scooby check out that silo where we saw jonas working.  a silo is where they store food.  oh, that kind of silo.  hear that, scoob. food.  why didn't you say so.  reah. food.  these tire tracks are leading us to the same place where the tractor wentnowhere.   you guys hear that rustling.  it's coming from the field.  .  thought you might want directions to get out of here, or a nice glass of warm milk to settle your nerves.  no, thanks. we're good.  calm as can be.  well, you shouldn't be.  ..and why is that.  legend has it that 50 years ago, there was a man named farmer terwilliger.  i call him farmer t.  made a tragic mistake by building his brandnew farm on an ancient burial site.  he angered the spirits somethin' fierce, so they rose up from their graves and took over the farm.  they used farmer t.'s very own tractor to run him down and make him one of their own.  and to this day, he still returns to seek his revenge, as the evil, repulsive, bloodthirsty demon farmer.  aah. aah.  i think i'm ready for that glass of warm milky.  like, i thought farms were fun, happy places, scoob.  you know, chickchick here, and moomoo there.  but here we are, looking for a crazy demon farmer who's trying to plow us down with a screamscream here and a squishsquish there.  reah, squishsquish.  at least we have this silo, hopefully filled with delicious munchies.  hoo hoo hoo hoo. jackpot.  popcorn.  like, i knew they were holdin' out on us.  this popcorn is amazing, scoob.  red ones taste like chocolateflavored pizza.  wait, don't tell me.  taco fudge.  jonas: hey, who said you could snoop around here.  uh, like, we didn't know you need permission to snoop.  well, this is my silo and my popcorn.  grab a bowl, everyone.  you've never tasted marshmallow and onion ringflavored popcorn like this before.  where did you get that popcorn.  like, your silo is stuffed with the stuff.  i'm sorry, but you can't have it.  first, mr. b. denies having popcorn.  now he's hoarding it.  come on, let's go set a trap before there are too many suspects to keep track of and my head starts to hurt again.  ok, gang, it's simple.  here's what the demon trap needs to look like. )
