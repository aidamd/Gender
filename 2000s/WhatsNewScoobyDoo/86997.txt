 i'm up here.this is toots.  she loves peanuts, and, coincidentally,so do i.  2 for you, 1 for me.  2 for you, 1 for me.  and she also loveselephant jokes. watch.  how do you makean elephant float.  just add ice cream.   see.  float. ice cream.  oh, i get ithee hee hee.  that's scooby's new pal,little pete.  what a cutie. is he new here.  he was foundin the wild, and they've beencaring for him in the zoo nursery.  oh, there's little pete.  i knew he'd be out here with scooby.  zella the zookeeper, meet my pals.  time for another lunch break.  sure, if you'd like.  but i need to get little pete ready for his flight.  i thought penguins were flightless birds.  but it's time for this penguin to go back to his family in antarctica.  you mean the one in the south pole.  but that's so far away, and scooby's been taking really good care of him here.   ..  i'm afraid it's for his own welfare.  he needs to be back in his natural climate.  ..tell you what.  seeing as scooby's been such a good uncle and shaggy's so good at taking care of animals, how would you guys like to accompany little pete on the trip back home.  i'll take that as a yes.  fred: hey, shaggy, thanks for asking the zookeeper if we could come with you to antarctica.  like, the trip wouldn't be a trip without you guys along.  guess scoob's got his job cut out, huh, keeping little pete from gettin' bored.    hey, cold enough for ya.  it's nice and chilly for the little guy.  i wouldn't have it any other way.  love the cold.  in fact, i'm a dedicated iceist.  ..  someone who chews ice.  only on special holidays.  we devote our lives to the love of frozen water.  it's a depleting resource, you know.  in a million years or so, this will be an iceless planet.  and then what will we do.  i never like to plan that far ahead.  that's why i fly these runs to the eventually melting south pole.  gotta enjoy ice while you got it.  by the way, i don't mean to pry, but who's flying the plane.  we're on automatic pilot.  this baby practically flies itself.  want a turn behind the wheel.  sure. i pride myself on my driving skills.  refasten your seat belts.   fred: what's this thing dooaaah.  this is a piece of caaaaake.  captain: cape dart way station, built on an acre of prime ice estate.  nearest neighbor hasn't been seen in an ice age.  daphne: i don't see any penguins yet.  it's so dark out.  what time is morning.  july.  until then, it's continual night.  shaggy: man, what a great ple for sleepin' in.  looks like they weren't expecting guests.  this place was up and running just last week.  ..workers.  something's terribly wrong.  i'll say. look over there.   whenyou're up, you're prepared.  kellogg's frosted flakes gives you the energy you need to be your best.     you up.      fuel up with the greattasting energy in every sweet and crunchy frosted flake.  a tasty part of a complete breakfast.  they're grrreat.     are you up.     mething must have really scared him.  like, maybe he's the guy who has to clean up this place.  aah.  that thing. that thing.  easy, easy. you're safe now.  aah.  those hoods do scary things with your hair.  please, try to relax.  can you tell us who you are.  ..hopper.  assistant to dr. armand zola.  and who's that.  eee.  forgive me. i've been through quite an ordeal.  would you like to tell us about it.  no, no, no.  but i have to. you must be warned.  zola's a brilliant scientist with the answers to global warming, the shrinking ozone, the threat to polar wildlife.  amazing. where is this man.  a giant creature slithered out of the sea, part human and part hideous, scaly, knifetoothed fish monster.  it demolished this place and dragged out zola, plunging him down, down into the freezing waters below us.  petey wants to go home.  the workers ran for their lives, but i couldn't move.  ..  ..no.  relax, mr. hopper. it's all over now.  ee.  or not.  the generator. somehow it's working again.  where's the generator.  out there in the generator room.  now, that's great planning.  what's that.  fred: halt. who goes there.  ii mean, who's already here.  zoinks. it's another creature.  it's just a person in a diving suit.  why would anyone be wearing a diving suit indoors.  because i'm freezing.  i designed this suit to withstand cold hundreds of degrees below zero.  who are you anyway.  we came to bring a penguin back to the wild.  you should have stayed inside.  have you noticed it's really cold here since the generator was wrecked.  but now it's on again.  i'm sergeant linda rauch from the army corps of engineers, .. bleak, chilling place.  i guess we owe you some thanks for the repairs.  ..  unless you can arrange for a transfer to maui.  brr.  fred: we'd better get this little penguin back to penguinville.  according to the zookeeper's information, the penguin population should be right where these buildings are.  innocent penguins displaced by a gross misuse of ice.  i tell people not to build on the ice field, but do they listen.  i need to prep my props and fly you icebreakers outta here.  seems like she wouldn't mind seeing the whole way station go away.  how do we find the penguins.  look for tuxedos, and if they're on birds, that's them.   no sign yet of little pete's colony.  good thing you brought along those nightvision binoculars.  it's 3 more months till morning.  ..what has gills and scales and runs like a man, but looks like a shark.  daphne this is no time for a riddle.  no. i really see it. look.  jinkies. it's that finned fiend.  what do we do.  .  split up, gang, and run.  rrrr.  yikes.  hang on, shaggy.  but it's hanging on to me.  unh.  rrrr.  that thing's got fred.  thank you, iq,for lending me your objectsfor my catapult.   ..not now.  this won't stop me.  .. ohhh...ticket.  try goldfish grahams.  baked with whole grain and a touch of sweetness.  . the snack thatsmiles back .  goldfish.  rrrr.  rrrr.  freddy. we can't get to him.  ..  yay. yay. yay.  aah. aah. aah.  rrrrr.  ohhhh.  bon voyage.  .   there's a man under the ice.   aah.  i wish you wouldn't keep doing that.  it's dr. zola, frozen solid.  man, he must be cold without his earmuffs.  daphne: do you think he can be revived.  he has so much to offer the human race.  he could even tell you where the penguins went.  he's got to be thawed out quickly.  like, does anyone here have a blow dryer.  what color.  not too quickly.  the sudden rise in temperature could threaten his life.  well, being frozen like leftovers couldn't be real good for his health either.  that's why i'm going to thaw out in my tanning booth.  seems like she'd do anything to get out of this place.  i made some tea to warm us up.  hey. aah.  listen up, i've got some bad news and some good news.  the bad news is i won't be flying you out of here for 2 days.  there's a big hail storm coming.  oh, no. hail storms make me really nervous.  what doesn't.  what's the good news.  hail is ice.  great.  well, we have 2 days.  let's get little pete to his, uh, people before that amphibious abnormality finds its way back.    shaggy: the tv here is just like the weather.  all you get is snow. ha ha.  rrrrr.  shaggy:.  the heat's off, too.  no heat.  but melting the ice was our only chance to revive dr. zola.  that engineer, sergeant linda, controls the power.  could she have something to do with the fishfaced felon.  we better go check out the generator room.  can you stay and watch dr. zola.  i would never leave his side.  there he goes.  all right, we need to split up again.  some of us need to go search that coastline, and some of us should keep watch here at the ice field.  shaggy, this time you and scooby get to choose.  let's see, the coastline is where daphne just saw the monster.  yeah.  but when we stay behind, the monster always finds us.  yeah.  on the other hand, the monster always finds us anyway.  yeah.  pick it already.  aah. aah.  rrrrr.  not this time, fella.  argh.  ooh. rrr.   oohoohooh.  no. no. save scooby.  you can't, shaggy.  the water's too cold. you'll freeze.  .  scooby. there's no time.  we've got to save scooby now before the gilled ghoul grabs him.  i'll find that subzero diving suit.  little pete. no.  his feathers protect him from the cold.  yeah, but, like, what's gonna protect him .  ohh.  aah.    is this some kind of air hose.  hmm.  .. mmmy hero.  daphne: we'll never get little pete back to his penguins while that scaly scoundrel's still skulking.  needless holes broken through the precious polar surface.  ice doesn't grow on trees, you know.   unless you count icicles.  i can't wait to cart all you icyhearted icehackers out of here.  i can't wait to go.  i'm already in training for the maui triathlon.  unh.   unh.  ah, that's a good goal.  ..1.  dr. zola's a brilliant man.  he knew when disaster would rear its disastrous head.  what do you mean.  the last time i came here, he warned everyone in the place to take my next flight out or they'd suffer horrendous consequences.  again, hmm.  suspects and clues seem to be swimming through here like minnows.  then the time has come for us to tackle that big fish.  well, gang, we're goin' for the prize catch.  we've got a flexible aluminum pole, precision reel, steel wire cable line, ..  live bait.  in fact, the live baitiest we've ever been.  don't worry, guys.  as soon as the creature shows to gobble up you tasty morsels, we snag him with this velcro suretostick net.  i don't know what's worse.  dangling here to attract a terrifying, ferocious sea freak, or spraying ourselves in scent of squid.  .  fred: whoa. they're biting today.  i see something coming under the ice.  seal. pull them up.  go away. go away.  we're not really fish.  scoob, bark or something.  huh.    hang in there, guys.  a good fisherman is always patient.   fred, i think the blood is running to our tail fins.  remember, patience is its own reward.  maybe so, but scooby snax are ours, plus a hot bath in the somewhat near future.  oh, oh, please.   the creature.  run.   it's all the same    same old town with a different name    that's fine by me    there's only one place that i want to be    southbound on i5    windows down and music on the stereo    i'm drivin', and i'm dreamin'    there's no place i'd rather go    starin' at white lines    on the side of the road    been on the road a while    i gotta get back to a place with style    hang out, havin' fun    i gotta get back to the beach and the sun    southbound on i5    windows down and music on the stereo    i'm drivin', and i'm dreamin'    there's no place i'd rather go    playin' every night    with the occasional fight   let's just see who's slithering under those scales.  the diving suit.  this must be that shivering sergeant.  daphne:..  all:.  aah.  this is one fish story that's worth hearing.  monroe: zola thought of everything, including a fish creature to scare people away while we froze his brain and body until the next century.  i knew that thing was human from the moment i found your air hose.  do you expect us to believe zola actually wanted you to shove him under the ice.  there's a depth of water in antarctica that's the coldest in the entire world, preserving him as no cryogenics could so he might share his brilliant plans for the future with the future.  dr. zola: unbelievable.  that's what i say.  .  so this is the world of the future.  it's not at all what i expected.  the clothes and the people so much like ours in the far past, yet so different.  you, sir, do you speak my language.  like, no problem, dude.  i didn't think so.  i wonder how long i've been frozen.  monroe: about 3 days.  . hopper. what are you doing here.  i'm sorry to say, sir, the experiment failed because of them.  you mean you kids would dare to meddle with the future of mankind.  well, if the shoe fits.  dr. zola: i can finally go home now and forget the screwloose idea of freezing myself for the future.  hopper, did you pack my cloning kit.  yes, sir.  hope you don't mind a detour.  captain cloyd is dropping me off at the sydney airport.  i got my transfer to maui.  and then i'm back to the south pole.  the time has come to settle down on that little ice farm.  zola, we located the penguins.   well, scooby, better say goodbye to your little pal.  like, you've been a good uncle, scoob.  little pete's learned a lot from you.   scoobydoobydoo.  aw.  bye.  no more, mom. come on, come on.  i mean, that is like your third memory card.  sorry. it's just that i remember my prom.  so much joy, so much passion.  the best night of our lives, rememb )
