"goodbye".  daphne, your voice sounds kinda funny.  do you have a cold orooh, jeez.  jinkies. what is that thing.  it's either a monster truck or a truck monster, and, like, i don't know which is worse.  step on it, fred.  aah. ahoh.  bwa ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.   come on, gang. let's get that scurrying skeleton.   where did he go.  well, if it ain't my good buddy fred.  it's burr batson.  we raced against him in mexico at the enduro slam 5,000.  any chance you own a skeleton suit.  nice try, little lady, but burr batson has nothin' to do with the monster truck that's been hauntin' this track.  haunting. haunting.  oh, yeah, that ghost driver's been smashin' up cars pretty bad, knockin' the best drivers out of the race.  heck, old champ truman retired after what happened to him.  but don't worry, fred.  that skeleton driver's not goin' after the amateurs.  ha ha.  ladies.  jeepers.  maybe it's too dangerous for you to race this weekend, freddy.  like, yeah, the only race we should do is race the heck outta here.  uhhuh.  hang on, guys.  i've been training for months.  that trophy is mine.  well, then that means we have a mystery to solve.  oh, great, not only do we have to deal with a spooky skeleton, but this one's got a driver's license.  daphne: so where's our hotel.  we're staying here at the track.  because there's a hotel here i just can't ..  please.  fred: the mystery machine now sleeps 5, thanks to a few modifications i made.  ..  our new bedrooms.  oops. wrong button.  ..bedrooms.  i meant to label these things, really.  ehh, it could be a wiring problem.  bedrooms for 5, and everything goes back into place at the push of a button.   hmm. i wonder what that did.  let's not find out.  hi, kids, are you big racing fans.  sure are. i'm jimmy.  i'm cindy.  we have our own car in the race.  .. our daddy does.  and he taught me everything he knows.  you'll all see.  i'm gonna be the best racer ever.  well, not for a few years there, at least if you want to be able to touch the peddles.    is that your dad over there, jimmy.  yeah, that's him.  hello.   ..  focused.  very focused. heh.    what is that sound.  bwa ha ha ha ha.  freddy, do something.  watch this.  you missed, mister.  and, yes, there is such a thing as too thin.  way to go, fred.  but, uh, how do we get down.  hmm. didn't think of that.  so what do you think that speedy skeleton was doing here in the rv park.  if someone is trying toare off the competition for tomorrow's race, anyone at the track could be a suspect.  gang, i think it's time wesplit up and look for clues.  we'll see ya after the monster attacks us.  come on, scoob.  how did he know i was gonna say that.  welp, if we have to look for that ferocious 4wheeler, no sense doin' it on an empty stomach.  eh hee hee hee hee hee.  ooh, shaggy.  scoobydoo, now that's my kind of clue.  shaggy:..much... free food...  we need help carrying all this.  uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh.  car.  fred's car.  ugh. uhh. argh.  bwa ha ha ha ha.  bwa ha ha ha ha.   hey, what's this.  just a hunch, but i'll bet it's the car jimmy and cindy's dad races.  quick thinking, fred.  but, you know, there was something odd about their dad. aah.  i'll save you.  freddy, stop.  it's just a crash test dummy.  ..  i knew that.  a crash test dummy.  what's it doing here.  aah. whehhoo.  yikes.  whoa. uhh.  whew. that was a close one.  scoob and i nearly became a tasty truckabob.  yeah, truckabob.  hold on there, shaggy.  i don't think the monster was after the 2 of you.  vroom. vroom.  vuhuhh vroom.  tryin' out new drivers, huh.  they can't be any worse than you.  oh, go torque something.  hyuhhh.  hey, there, jimmy.  uh, can i get you some phone books to sit on.  aw, man.  careful, kids, you're sitting in one powerful piece of machinery.  hey, we know all about cars.  well, because of our dad.  you'll find out during the race.  come on, cdy.  drivers, to your cars.  the race is about to begin.  wish me luck, gang.  it's time to ride.  hey, fred, the gas pedal's the one on the right, ha ha ha ha.  announcer:t.  racing is underway in the gainesville 500.  here comes fred.  ok, fred's about to roll in.  guys, we need to do this in under 10 seconds.  hey, girlie, you gonna use a curling iron on the lug nuts. ha ha ha.  curling iron jokes should not be made by men with ridiculous hairstyles.  never mind.       whatever it takes, fred ain't gonna beat my ricky.  that guy sure would do anything to help his driver win.  announcer: and burr batson takes the lead.  daphne: fred, you have to get out of there.  ok, daph, i'm coming into the pit area.  skeleton: that's what you think.  ..daphne.  you didn't happen to install an autopilot when i wasn't looking.  oh, no. fred's lost control of his car.  he'll lose control of his stomach when he sees what i've got planned for him.  want to know the best way to shave weight off a car, fred.  a crash diet.  fred's out of control.  we have to save him.  we have to head out on the track.  and, like, how do we get out there.   .  oops. heh heh. we're in the wrong car.  we'll get out right now.  floor it.    jinkies, this car is fast.  ..  safe driver checklist: um, hands at 10 and 2check, uh, mirrorscheck, 3i'll do it later.  ah. sorry.  pardon me. look out. dehow.  we've got catch up to him.  smash mouth:  hey      you'll see my game's on fire    but we don't play the same game    you'll see i'm greedy for speed    and neutral means nothin' to me    so if that's your desire    we'll get along famously    but one thing    i like to lead    i light 'em up before the motor starts    i go so fast that i could never stop    look under the hood 'cause you don't know what i got    i'm a moving violation, baby    hot, hot    hot, hot    highway    that's my scene    i may look like a blur when you see me    and i mean, i'm flirtin' with disaster    i'm a master of gs    goin' faster, gonna pass ya    gonna pass some dust your way    and i'm sayin'    i light 'em up before the motor starts   ..   enh rah rah rah.  shaggy: like, there he c we've gotta get you out of there.  i've got a plan.  shaggy and scooby will stretch between the 2 cars.  i'll then walk across them to your car and safety.  sounds good.  ready, guys.  shaggy and scooby aren't here.  at the sound of the tone, please leave a message.  beep.  i've got scooby snax.  come on, scoob, we have to help our best friend: scooby snax.  ha hai mean fred.  steady.  steady.  freddy, go back.  hey, i can steer again.  hang on, guys.   how did you regain control.  i don't know.  like, maybe it was this thing that i just broke off.  well, gang, i think i have this mystery just about wrapped up.  and, for once, i'm going to set the trap with fred as the bait.  ooh, this sounds clever.  and much safer for me and scoob.  velma: we need you back in the race, fred.  thanks to that monster truck, jimmy and cindy's dad has taken the lead.  i'm ready to go.  ..  i think.  whoa, daphne, this car looks amazing.  you fixed it, but how.  never underestimate the power of team scooby.   fred's headed back into the lead.  any second now, we should seeperfect. it's all part of my plan.  rahhhh.  come and get me, mr. bones.  ok, now we just need one more thing for my trap.  come on.  fred's remote control.  yes, but if i cross the blue wire with the red one, it becomes a remote blocker.   aah like, hey, it stopped.  they stopped. but why.  velma: just as i suspected.  it was all controlled by remote, and whoever is behind it would need a powerful antenna to broadcast that signal.  there he is.  fred, meet us at the tower.  yes, it's me. i did it.  i did it all, except for the stuff my sister did.  but why.  i wanted to show everyone i'm the best race car driver in the whole world, but they wouldn't let me in the race because i was too young.  racer and made up the story about my dad being a driver.  it was me in control the whole time.  but, like, what about that monster truck.  cindy was controlling the truck to get rid of my competition, and we would have gotten away with it, too, if it wasn't for you meddling grownups.  and, uh, meddling dog.  yeah, meddling dog.  announcer: and the race isn't over yet, folks.  team scooby snax is back on the track.  announcer: and fred jones takes the checkered flag here at the gainesville 500.   fred did it. he won.   let's celebrate back at the mystery machine with a barbecue.  no need. we've got it covered, right, scoob.  ha ha ha. ha ha ha. ha ha ha.  scoobydooby barbicuey.   program to bring you courage
