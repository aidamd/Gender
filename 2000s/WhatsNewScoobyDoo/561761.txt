gang.  there's a mystery wriggling around.  good thing the worm only popped a tire.  hey, where's the jack.  oh, i had to take out that to make room for a few extra off road modifications.  like what.  hydrolic lifters, ejector seat, emergency flotation device.  why would we need a flotation device in the middle of the desert.  well, you never know when a flash flood might hit.  besides, who needs a jack when you've got a first rate pit crew.  huh. huh.   now i understand why they call it a "pit " ha ha ha. like, it's the pits.  there. all done.   like, it's the worm.  both: ow. ow. ow. ooh.

cutting right across the race course.  i can make it. i can make it.  i was wrong.  all: phew.  that was close.   everyone slide forward.  no, no, the other forward.  like, looks like the race is over for us.  all: aah.  wow, that thing took off like a jet.  unfortunately catching us in its tail wind.  wow, your flotation device actually came in handy.  pontoonsdon't leave home without 'em.  look, it's roberto torres' motorcycle.  but where is he.  like, maybe the giant worm got him.   fred: hey, the protesters we saw at the start of the race.  what are they doing down here.  what are we doing down here.  and exactly where is here.  why, wormtopia, of course, the ancient home of the great worm gusano grande.  el gusano. el gusano.  well, we're sorry for the intrusion.  but we really do need to get out of here.   we'll be happy to show you the way out after the great wormian feast.  there's a feast.  yes, and you're the guests of honor.  oh, great worm, accept this offering of evildoers who dare to desicrate your sacred shrine with their nasty off road vehicles.  like, this is an honor.  never trust anyone wearing a worm suit.    it is the great one.  gusano lives.  all: long live the worm.  long live gusano grande.  looks like we're worm food.  there's a tunnel out of here.  but we'll never get past these worm dudes.  unless we can distract them somehow.  too bad we don't have an early bird to get the worm.  hey, like, who says we don't.   scooby: caw. caw.  all: aah.  what.  scooby: caw. caw.  oh, ha ha. how do you do that, scoob.    both: whoa.   looks like we're still in

figured the worm had to be a racer.  because it always went after the leader.  it wanted to win.  my first clue was this piece of worm tooth.  it's black glass like the lunar panels on gibby's car.  then the worm oozed green stuff just like the fluid from his radiator.  i didn't wanna hurt anyone.  i just wanted to impress velma with my super cool worm mobile.  you mean, you did it for me.  yep, and i would have gotten away with it, if not for you meddling off the road racers.  so who won the race.  actually, no one did.  with the gulch blocked, you'd have to go on foot.  run for it.
