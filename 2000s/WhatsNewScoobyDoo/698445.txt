what, meadow.  about the cat creature.  .  yeah. they say it's huge.  it can pounce on you from anywhere, and it rips stuff to, like, shreds with these razorlike claws.  it's been terrorizing the event.  they might even cancel the dog show.  that's terrible.  well, i guess my uncle's castle's looking pretty good right about now, huh.  well, gang, it looks like we've got a mystery to solve.  yeah, we'd better be on the lookout for any fiercelyfanged felines.  meadow: you're gonna stay.  well, you sure are brave.  ..purple.  whoa. whoa. neat.   yeah, i should charge admission.  shaggy: you must be, like, the best dog groomer ever huh.  aw, don't try to butter me up, kid.  i don't give out freebies.  unless, of course, you want a snip there, handsome.  uh, thanks. no.  i kinda like my natural look.  you cut hair or people, too.  that's my dream, but so far no one will hire me.  they say i'm only good with dogs.  well, you sure are good at this.  this. ha. this is nothing.  that's my real star over therechrissy.  she's the defending worldchampion golden retriever.  uh, who are you.  oh, i'm chrissy's owner, mr. b.  meet maize, flax, jingle, knox, 14karat, and, of course, bling bling.  sounds like some kind of rap group.  well, i call them the secret 6 for short because they were pretty much a secret till they got here.   yeah, one day all 6 could be grand champions.  you must be proud of chrissy, mr. b.  aw, i sure am.  p.a. announcer: the international dog show is about to begin.  gentlemen, start your canines.    oh, no, it's the cat creature.   aah.      hmm.  huh.   phew.   unh.   you know we can't leave an eyewitness.   fred: man, i'd hate to see the size of that cat creature's litter box.  all 6 of chrissy's pups are missing.  b, we'll help you find the puppies.  and capture that cat creature.  scoob, there you are, old buddy, old friend, old pal.  where's your collar.  what's the matter with you, scoobydoo, cat creature got your tongue.  it's the puppies we wanted, not this stupid mutt.  don't worry, boy, we've got plans for you.    hey, look, a toupee or a hairless chihuahua.  ha. it's just some fur i found.  i wanted to show you guys, but then i got caught up on how it shimmers in the light.  shimmer. shimmer.  uh, sorry to bum your shimmer.  cat fur. could be a clue.  oh, i hate to think of those poor little puppies out there with that cat creature on the prowl.  don't worry, daphne.  we'll split up and look for clues.  . with that terrible tabby on the loose.  oh, i vote no way. uhuh. oh, no.  and so does scoob.  looks like you're outvoted, shaggy.  we'll go up and check out the sound booth.  you guys can take the unpatrolled, dimlylit parking structure.  ..you don't mind splitting up.    quiet.  boy, do i hate dogs.   now we sit tight for our signal from the boss.   huh.   what is it with you and those stupid gadgets.  look, you don't complain when i make all that cool spy stuff for you.  shh.   ..2...3...4...5.  ..  huh. huh. ooh.  nothin' down here to frighten anybody.  especially nothin' catlike.  nosiree.    yikes.  scooby, you're supposed to jump in my arms like you always do when we see terrifying creatures.   heh heh, it's only a kitty.  i knew that.    scoob, chill, man.  this is so not like you.    ..    what was that.  .  the dogs are gone.   funny how our footsteps echo so loud in this place.   especially when we're not walking anymore.  let's make a dash for the exit tunnel.  aah.  huh.  come on, scooby, the cat creature's here somewhere.  i get it.  fear has messed with your mind.  maybe these will set you right.  scooby snaxjalapeno and applesauce blend.  the best.  yecch.   ..h.  like, something's wrong here.  very wrong.  we lost them in those woods.  boss, slight change in plans.  the secret 6 escaped.  boss:.  well, not for long.  don't worry, we won't lose them.  no sign of that pernicious pussycat.  but look what i found.  it's a oneofakind burlaplike fabric.  2 of a kind.  it looks like this scrap i picked up near chrissy's kennel.  it's just as i suspected.  those pups aren't lost.  they were dognapped, and i'm willing to bet the cat creature was a diversion.  hey, gang, have i got a news flash for you.  this isn't the real scoobydoo. )
