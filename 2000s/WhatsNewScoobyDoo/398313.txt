like, i thought we'd never get out.  hey, what's this.  part of a rubber suit covered with that limestone paste.  well, here we are with a mystery and no suspects.  .  how about the fashion designer who'd do anything to push his label or the jealous rival model or that ghastly gargoyle groupie.  or that slithery screen star who hang glides.  but his soulful eyes always conceal a valiant heart.  ok, he's a suspect already.  but i think i know just how to find our culprit.  i hope so.  before it's too late to save my cousin.  well, let's set a trap.  let's see. shaggy said the gargoyle is ticklish.  so we need a whole lot of feathers, of course, some dynamite and 3 catcher's mitts.  i have an easier trap.  what could be easier than feathers and dynamite.  anything.  but this one takes place at the fashion expo.  i hope this works.  the family resemblance is uncanny.  so you look like danica.  yes, but so does uncle julius when he's in heels.  : madames and monsieurs, toddy stickfigure has invited you here tonight in honor of our missing model of the year danica la baye.  so witness now the spectacular grand entrance of guy l'avorton with new model of the year brooke bjork.  madams and masseurs.  presenting the nolonger missing model of the year.   . no.  it's impossible for her to be here.  oops.  sonny: danica.  whoa.  you will bring my gargoyle.  sanctuary.  please, sonny, put her down.  the gargoyle will come for danica.  and i, at last, will have my gargoyle.  i'm not danica.  yes, you are.  and there is no gargoyle.  yes, there is.  right behind you.  ah, my pretty one, join your stone brothers and sisters.  unh. aah.  no.  come back.  aah.  thank you. now i know who the gargoyle is.  danica.  you're wearing that perfume i sent you last christmas, eau de danger prone.  danica kidnaped herself.  i wanted to escape from the super model fast track.  it was too much for me.  so guy and i planned to have me disappear.  then brooke could be model of the year and i could have a normal, quiet life, like cousin daphne.  if she only knew.  the gargoyle would've gone away.  but then daphne showed up with her meddling amis, and guy and i had to lead you off my track.  ..  so you became the gargoyle one last time to save me.  but of course, my cousin.  did you bring my makeup.  need you ask.  so stone paste from the quarry was used to make danica into a gargoyle.  beauty isn't just limestone deep.  and once again, guy l'avorton gave his all for l'amour.   looks like notre dame's got a new gargoyle.   scoobydoobydoo.  adieu adieu adieu.

shaggy and scooby weren't topseeded in this sandcastle contest.   i owe it all to my trusty teammate.   me, too.   you guys are amazing.   it's a sand treehouse.  the tricky part's the tree.   this is one time our vacation is going to be pure vacation.   these'll do for a start.   i'm reading about the great barrier reef.  doesn't it boggle your mind that there are prehistoric creatures living down there.   anything before the creation of tv dinners boggles my mind.  ha ha ha.   nothing like oneman volleyball.  i always win.   nice, but you also always lose.   wow, like, some of these sand shacks are pretty darn good.   i'll take that as a grand accolade.  frankie martin here.  i call my creation "italian "  like, very cool.  i'm shaggy, and this is scooby.   the shaggy and scooby.  didn't you do the actual working sand roller coaster.   well, it only had one loop.   you blokes are good, but i have to warn you right now, nothing's gonna stop me from winning this competition.   except maybe that.    guess our little beach party comes with a soundtrack.   hey, stop it, you blighters.  this is sand castle beach.   i'm sorry, but we were told it's beachapalooza beach, and my band needs to practice for the concert.   jeepers, it's smash mouth, and you're steve harwell.  you're my favorite.   thanks.   why can't we have music and sandbuilding.   because the sounds destroy our masterpieces, and we were here first.   but we came as invited guests.   well, now you're invited to go.   hey, peace, mates.  we can all work together here in harmony.   welcome.  a voice of reason.   you keep your decibels low, we'll keep our walls thick.   yeah, right, yeah, ok.  yeah, right.   hey, you're rama yam, in charge of the castle competition.  we've entered to build king arthur's castle with a drivethru seafood window.  " when do we start.   right after our warmup yoga exercises.  please, join us.   like, i always thought yoga was named after a bear.   we must prepare our inner harmony for agility and creativity.  excellent downward dog position.   thanks.   that coralit's coming alive.    jeepers, those 3 kidsthey just disappeared, sucked under the sand.   where's that coral thing.   it's gone.   maybe we should disappear back to the u.s.a.  where the only danger on the beach is painful sunburn.   not yet.  you've got a contest to win, and we've got a mystery to solve.   we should be safe in here for tonight.  tomorrow, we're working on the drawbridge and a guard tower.   awesome detail.   thank you.    hey, we better see what's going on.   great idea, freddy.  when you find out, we'll be right here hiding.      raaahhhr.   first time we've ever worn out a monster.    rama yam, are you all right.   yeah.  i ran out when i heard the screaming.  then i saw the coral creature, and then 3 more sand builders disappeared.   where.   right where you're standing.   hmm, what's this.   my medallion.  reckon i lost it in the scuffle.   what does it say.   that's sanskrit, mate.  ancient hindu writing.  "  dude, what's all the ruckus.   where'd you come from.   we've been here all day, riding in the gnarly waves.   we've been here all day, too.  how come we haven't seen anybody surfing.   that's becauseow, sean.  that's my sore toe.   then zip it, shawna.   while you were surfing, did you notice anything weird.   sure did, dude.   disappearing teenagers.   flat surf.  that's when we came in for some zs.   whoa, dude.  catch that wave.   banzai.   hope it's safe enough for us to rebuild our castle.   yeah, me, too.   look at all the footprints in the wet sand.  and paw prints.  and there's bird prints and crab prints and monster prints ..  monster prints.   double yikes.  zoinks.   the sand castle's destroyed.   jinkies.   kelp.  kelp.   don't worry, we'll help.   no, kelp.  we're stuck in seaweed.   it's pulling them into the water.   not if i can help it.  hyah.  just when it thought it was safe to go back on the beach.   that thing doesn't seem to breathe well out of water.   maybe it lost this.   some kind of breathing tube.  looks like there's something more than coral behind all this.   i'd sure like to know what it did to those kids.   me, too.   which kids.   the ones that looked like big sanddrip castles, except without the castle part.   where did you see them.   right over there.   this wet sand is just wet sand.   ew.  these rocks are really gross.   they're coated with algae.  that means they've been brought up from under the sea, and i have a feeling there's a reason.   and i have a feeling it's a scary reason.   yeah, me, too.   i'm reading about coral.  it's a living skeletal thing that can grow as big as an island, but not one word about coral that can walk.   like, it looks like you and scooby and i are the only ones left in this contest.   well, don't prepare any speeches, mates.  'cause after i finish the fountains with the dancing waters, i'll have the winning entry.   at least today you've been able to work in peace.   who did that.  who's responsible.   or not.   crikey, what's buggin' you now.   come see for yourself.  you guys come, too.  i need witnesses.   what happened here.   those were the band's instruments.   now how are we supposed to perform.  and tomorrow's the concert.   guess your little show will just have to wait.   there's only one person that could've sunk this low.   and guess what.  it's not me, though i do like the peace and quiet, and the sculpture shows a certain miami beach mixedmedia style.   keep trying to control the beach, and you're asking for more trouble.   you can't scare me away.   so none of the band members have disappeared, bualmost all of the sand builders have.   i can't believe a band would go that far just to play in the beachapalooza.   over there.  come on.   help me.  aah.   he's gone.   we need to find out where these disappearing people are disappearing to.  that means it's time for a plan.  does anybody have one.   that's usually your department.   just thought it would be polite to ask.  ..   why can't somebody else put their life on the main line.   as much as we'd love to, the target seems to be sand sculptors.  and you two are our only sand sculptors.   see these blips on the navigational screen.  that's you, and that's scooby.  you'll be under constant surveillance.  we'll be right behind you, no matter where you're taken.   taken.  what makes you think we're gonna go along with this.   huh.   your backpacks each have programmed compartments containing timereleased scooby snacks.   ha ha.  like, you drive a hard bargain, freddy.  like, i think there's only one thing we wouldn't do for scooby snacks, and that's go without scooby snacks.   yeah.  hee hee.  that makes sense.   but it looks like we would offer ourselves to a horrifying coral creature and be yanked down under a beach, only to be turned into disgusting sanddrip monsters.  let's go back.   yeah.   raaaahr.   ..  i don't got 'em.   there they go.    we need a new planet you were a rock but i took you for granite ain't that a shame ain't it a sin.  we had too much baggage when our ship came in and like a laser beam you're never what i see i ought to better my best behavior i can't deny )
