  nana nana na    nana nana na    nana na na nana na    nana nana na nana nana na   animation department of education reporter: from making the city of pacoima, california, disappear to being encased for a week in a giant cube of gelatin, rufus raucous has made magic crazyfresh for a new generation of fans.  now, strapped telhehe w of misfortune by his lovely assistant phylidia, he'll attempt a daring escape from inside this historic las vegas hotel as it's demolished by a 10ton wrecking ball.  i'm nancy chang with the exclusive live report.  rufus raucous is still inside.  this is horrible.  stop the camera. stop the camera.  e, gang.las vegas, nevada.  velma: just thinkwe get to seethe eiffel tower, the canals of venice,and ancient rome withoutgoing to europe.  like, i've never seen so manyallyoucaneat buffets.   viva las vegas.  reah. riva ras regas.  look at all the shops.  velma: there's a worldclassart collection at the garagio, a broadwaystyle theater.  shaggy: hey.it'srats: the musical.  i hear vegas hassome of the best elvis impersonators in the world.  hey, uh, thank you, ma'am.  thank you very much.  my sunglasses.  but i can't domy elvis without them.  really.  oops. darn these fragile,imported sunglasses.  hey. there'sour destination.  fred: newark newark.  las vegas' firstnew jerseythemed resort.  i'm guessing it's las vegas'only new jerseythemed resort.  daphne: and the siteof the biggest concert event of the year.  teen pop sensationlindsay pagano's headlining debut, which we just so happen to have backstage passes for.  fred: thanks to shaggy and scooby.  you guys really wanted to go backstage and meet lindsay, huh.  no, fred, we want to go backstage and eat the catering spread.  you must be our lucky radiocontest winners.  welcome to newark newark.  i'm del stone. i run the joint.  thanks for having us, mr. stone.  uh, i'm curious, mr. stone.  what made you decide on a new jerseytheme for your resort.  somebody already had a pirate ship hotel, so we went with our second choice.  now, that makes perfect sense.  uh, it's a joke, kid.  well, shall we.  everything about this theater is stateoftheart.  except for the name.  the spectacular spackle dome.  corporate sponsorship.  believe it or not, spackle is one of newark's biggest exports.   that's a good one, mr. stone.  uh, that wasn't a joke, son.  oh.  we do our best to respect the whole newark theme.  like, are creepy black cats a part of the theme.  darn cat.    hmm.  daphne: it seemed to vanish under that statue.  like, make that a floating statue.  froating statue.  guys, it's a statue of the late, great magician rufus raucous.  levitating was his signature trick.  no wires. hmm.  that kid was the greatest showman i'd known since elvis.  you knew elvis.  stone: rufus was supposed to be the spackle dome's main attraction.  the theater was designed specifically to house his show.  sadly, it was not to be.  well, why don't you go in and check out rehearsal.  i've got to see a maintenance man about a vanishing cat.  disappearing black cats. spooky dead magicians.  i don't think our luck could get any worse, scoob.  zoinks.  or maybe it could.    oh, baby, baby    you told me i'm your queen    it's funny how you show it    always acting so mean    my heart is broken    and i'm feeling kind of low    if you think i love you, boy    you're living in de nile     ..   talk about a lavish production.   ominous voice: get out.  oh, hey. ha ha ha.  it's part of the show.  ..  that can shoot fireballs.  it looks like rufus raucous.  or his ghost.  on that note, like, good night, everybody.  well, whatever it is, it's not a lindsay pagano fan.  huh.  well, that was totally weird.  daphne: it looked like rufus raucous' ghost.  scooby: ghost.  you really think it was a ghost.  i don't know.  oh, by the way, i'm fred.  this is daphne, velma, shaggy, and scoobydoo.  we're the lucky contest winners.  actually, i'm the lucky one.  i mean, you saved my life.  hey, i'm going to get lunch in a little bit.  you want to join me.  oh, no, thanks. i just ate an energy bar.  i'm super full.  aaahhhh.  the ghost again. let's get out of here.  it's fate's fools.  flapjack, bball, and timmy.  they're only, like, my favorite boy band in the whole world.  they're my opening act.  hey, what's with all the flappitylip flip.  we're totally trying to kick it chilly willie, and you peeps are bumming our van winkles with all this bogus woofering and tweetering.  what did he say.  it's too noisy out here.  we're trying to rest our vocal chords for the show. duh.  i'll try to keep it down the next time a ghost tries to kill me.  oh, shiver me timbers.   is everyone all right.  i heard there was a disturbance.  lindsay's all wiggity with the boohoo, sir.  might be funkalicious if me and my boyos headline in her place.  nice try, flapjack, but i wouldn't give up my first headlining gig in vegas because of a stupid ghost.  there's not going to be any show.  i'm canceling it until we discover who or what is responsible for this damage.  my show just can't get canceled.  well, we could help ferret out the ghost.  we've solved a few mysteries in our day.  that is so generous and brave of you.  look, scoob. the green room.  maybe that's where they keep, like, salads and vegetables.   the ghost.   whoa.  what's up, guys.  like, we are.  the ghost brought these cables to life.  a cable that leaks water.  interesting.  like, that ghost was hovering over there, near the rack of costumes.   like, the ghost has got scooby.  no, the floor does.  the metal on his collar is stuck.  it's like the floor is magnetized.  and the cable that snagged shaggy and scooby is hydraulic.  when water is forced through it, it moves.  this theater was designed for rufus raucous, remember.  these elaborate illusions are probably built right in.  italian silk.  jeepers.  the mask the ghost was wearing.  whoever was wearing it probably ditched it so they could slip out of the theater unnoticed.  or blend in with the people inside.  like a certain boy band that wanted to steal the top spot from my good friend lindsay, who sometimes lets me borrow her clothes.  go for it, girl. i've got doubles.  love you.  hey, what about del stone.  like, why would he want to sabotage his own theater.  well, del stone doesn't own this place.  he's just the manager.  he was losing his shirt, and he sold to a big conglomerate.  stone wants to ruin the hotel out of spite.  there's one sure way to find out.  let's split up, gang.  shaggy, scooby, and i will check out mr.  stone.  and lindsay, velma, and i can check out some shops.  excuse me, uh, mr. stone.  fred: stone is trying to give us the slip.  i suddenly have a craving for steamed dumplings.  who's that.  he can't see us.  maybe if i disguise my voice, i can pump him for info.   ahem. thank you.  thank you very much.  engelbert humperdinck.  ..  yeah.  i tell you, eng, vegas has changed.  i've got to sneak away just to take a steam bath.  i know what you mean, boss.  viva las vegas.  kickin' it old school.  t.c.b. takin' care of business.  boy, you said it, eng.  say, boss, you know anything about this ghost business with that magician fella.  that's no ghost.  rufus raucous would have to be dead to be a ghost.   what. he's not dead.  who is that.  hey, dogs aren't allowed in here.  no.  and neither are nosy kids.  and your engelbert humperdinck impression stinks.  so did you girls find anything.  look what i got.  i couldn't resist.  there she is.  rufus raucous' former assistant, phylidia flanders.  please welcome the comedy/magic stylings of mr. wacky pants.  ladies and gentlemen, and you know what you are.  i learned everything i know about magic from my exwife, you see.  she made my bank account, my car, and my house disappear. ha.  now i'll need 2 volunteers.  like, we haven't had a bite all day.  well, here you go, then.  hey.  ohh.  the human puzzle box.  now, now, now, now, don't look so worried.  the only thing i ever made vanish was my hair.  watch the stomach.  it's my best feature.   uh, seriously, i just got this trick.  i need help.  ugh, so do we.   faked his death. no.  rufus couldn't walk away from the spotlight.  he loved magic too much.  he wouldn't have left me to scrape out a living with a hack like wacky pants.  hey, i resemble that remark.  and what is this.  oh, more kooks who think rufus raucous is still alive.  pbbbbt.  he's just jealous.  once rufus came on the scene, guys like wacky pants went out of fashion pretty quickly.  look, rufus isn't coming back.  here. this ought to convince you.  it's the footage from his last stunt.  guys. a little help, please.  he got outf there.  can you play that last part again, velma.  shaggy: like, what's that.  velma: it's a little line around computergenerated effects.  sometimes you see it in music videos.  so then maybe that's not real concrete falling down on rufus.  velma: if it's layered over the original image, i should be able to strip it away.  hey, it is a digital image.  daphne: look, he went through the floor.  this must have been prerecorded before the building actually came down.  and they spliced it into the broadcast so it looked like it was happening live.  hey, remember how scooby chased that cat, and it just vanished under the statue.  maybe that's where the trapdoor is.  fred, you may be onto something.   fred: look, gang, a dark, spooky tunnel.  dark and spooky.  no good ever comes from dark and spooky.   aah.  rraow.  oh. ohh.  guys, it's a mannequin of the great houdini, the famous illusionist.  do you guys see all this old magic stuff.  man: see with your eyes, not with your hands.  those things are priceless.  like, it's the ghost of rufus raucous.   it is rufus raucous.  hey, you're lindsay pagano. right on.  you mean you're not trying to keep her from performing in your theater.  my theater.  you mean that fun house upstairs. nah.  i'm not about that kind of stuff.  that's why i left: to get back to street magic.  i've got some amazing new tricks in the works.  well, like, if you're the real rufus raucous, .  grr.  grr.   here i come, vegas    give me all your glitter and gold    here i come, vegas    7 come 11 gonna soothe my soul    abracadabra alakazam    i'm shinin' like a

make the audience disappear.   rufus: wacky pants.  that jerk was after my secrets for years.  with phylidia at his side, he may finally have them.  but he doesn't seem to use them.  unless he's saving them for a surprise appearance at the spackle dome.  there's one way to find out.  we'll have to set a trap.  rufus, you up for it.  wacky pants.  definitely. count me in.  the sweet toothosaur.  no.  he stops at nothing to eat our sweet deliciousness.    raawrgh.      mmmm... gotta have my pops.  oooooh.  mml .  the grand prize.  with $10,000, i could get so much trix yogurt.  ..

rufus raucous, the magician the world watched perish on this very site, will return tonight, seemingly from the dead.  is this for real.  i don't know, but i do know i reported it first.  velma, you ready.  i'm not coming out.  just follow my lead.  you'll be fine announcer: please welcome the one, the only, rufus raucous.  i don't blame you for doubting it's me, but i intend to prove it the only way i know how: by astounding you, using only a deck of cards and my bare hands.   oh, sorry.  could you pick those up, velma.  now, nothing up my sleeve.  like i said, using only my hands.  huh.   jinkies.  velma, lend me a hand.  no way. these are mine.  there's a new face in magicmine.  impostor.  scooby, shaggy, now.  whoa.  huh.  velma: magnetic polarity. hmm.  whoa.  like, the ghost is grounded.  thanks to magnets in its shoes, the same magnets it used to levitate.  fred: hey, let me out.  like, where'd he go.  ed: hey.  it's time to bring the curtain down on mr. wacky pants' career.  velma: phylidia flanders.  rufus' assistant.  so that's how the ghost knew all of rufus' tricks.  wacky pants seemed like an obvious suspect, but he couldn't even do the simplest magic tricks.  the biggest clue, though, was rufus' cat.  it wasn't afraid of the ghost.  thus, the os thad to have been someone who was close to rufus.  hence, phylidia.  but why, phylidia.  because after you disappeared, i was supposed to step into the spotlight.  i knew all your tricks.  i would've made millions, but del stone wouldn't hear it.  so you wanted to ruin del stone.  that's right.  and i would have succeeded if not for you meddling kids.  well, you'll have plenty of time to develop your own act where you're going.  yeah, like, as long as you don't try any escape tricks.  all: ha ha ha ha ha ha.   my heart is broken    and i'm feelin' kind of low      you're livin' in de nile   i want to thank you kids for solving the mystery and for luring rufus out of retirement.  he's agreed to play the spackle dome a few times a year.  on my terms.  hey, scoob, i think we finally found the mother lode of backstage grub.  like, those are the biggest fruit salads i've ever seen.   some guys are like veggies    some guys are like pie    but there's a party fella who's the apple of my eye    yet all his friends are peaches    sweet as sweet can be    but why he doesn't know it is a mystery to me    life's a bowl of cherries    and you're really cute    let me show you i love you    with a basket of fruits   hey, look at shaggy and scooby.  ..    ahh.  scooby dooby doo. yeah.  animation
