 at's just the thing.  the egg wasn't very large at all.  lucky us.  it's going through an alien growth spurt.  don't worry, janet.  we're going to get to the bottom of this.  you guys go on ahead, but please be careful.  first thing we should do is check out the lab.  uhuh. scoob and i are staying right here.  yeah.  right here. where we just saw the alien.  suit yourself.  why does she always do that.  like, wait for us.  scooby: yeah.  my laptop says the material is definitely organic.  whatever it is, it sure is gooey.  not exactly a scientific term. ohh.  but you're right.  and there's water in the bottom of the egg case.  maybe that's because someone left this faucet on.  i wonder if that had any effect on the egg.  aah.  it's the alien.   aahaahaaaah.  ohhohoho.  hey, gang.  what is a makeup container doing in the lab.  maybe it belongs to janet.  i doubt it.  she didn't have any makeup on at the ceremony.  and if you don't wear makeup to an event like that, you certainly don't wear it while working in your lab.  ahh.  ahh.  ahchoo.  well, gang, it looks like there's only one thing left to do.  let me guess.  both: split up and look for clues.  how did i know he was gonna say that.  wow. just our luck, scoob.  the mess hall.  yeah.  check it out.  like, this is the dehydrating machine where they make all that astronaut food.  watch.  a whole watermelon in one bite.  ohh. ho ho ho. oh, man, am i home.  this dehydrated stuff is the best.  half the height, 16 times the food.  hand me another 4 slices of tomato, would you, scoob.  like, thanks.  man, scoob, your fur's getting kind of scaly.   aah. alien.   how about going out for dinner.  how about helping with math, first.  how about calling for takeout.  how about calling sylvan.  if schoolwork

aah.  ahha ha ha ha.   unh. uhh.  aah. unh.   yikes.      hee hee hee hee.  huh.  way to go, scoob.  you trapped him.  like, who are you.  that doesn't matter right now.  hmm. what is this.  shaggy: it's like an alien rash.  wow. heh heh heh.  like, our janitor at school could never do that.  we have to get him to the infirmary.  is the coast clear.  yep. scoob trapped the alien in the storeroom.   well, like, heh heh, we thought he did.  hey, guys. any luck.  yep, and all of it bad.  we saw the alien.  and not only did we see him, but he's growing.  that menace from mars is now taller than freddy.  i wonder just how big it will get.  like, i don't want to find out.  me, neither.  janet, you sure are working late.  well, reggie has scheduled exercise, and i'm not going to let that alien stop me from getting my work done.  who's reggie.  a chimpanzee. wow.  reggie here is going on the next shuttle flight to do an important space walk.  he's truly amazing.  i can train him to do just about anything.  aah.  scooby, what are you doing.  we don't have time for swimming.  elliot.  what are you hiding behind your back.  nothing.  hey, let go of that, you fleabag canine.  this is the research data for janet's project.  this is classified.  so what.  i'm not scared ofjanet: what's going on here.  is thati thought i asked you not to look at my research.  velma did it. i tried to stop her.  what.  it doesn't matter who did it.  i told you that you were welcome to look around the lab, but my data was off limits.  i don't believe in violence, but that doesn't mean i don't know how to give a mean wedgy.  eww.  grrrr.  wait. wait. i can help you.  i doubt that highly.  trust me. i found something.  velma: you brought us to a janitor's closet.  would you just look inside already.  jeepers.  this looks like spy stuff.  what would a janitor being doing with all this.  well, there was something strange about that janitor who bandaged up captain treesdale.  she sure knew a lot about medicine.  looks like we better keep our eye on this mystery maintenance woman.  velma: if that shuttle doesn't launch, 5 years of janet's research is down the drain.  maybe that's why someone came up with this whole alien scheme.  but who could be behind it.  do you think keith dale might be hiding something.  or maybe our mystery janitor has a secret or 2.  i wouldn't put it past elliot.  hey, like, i got another suspect for you: him.   all: aaaah.   with a brandnew and improved    fresh functional design    engineered to fit    within the fashion of our times    radioactivity    and burning in the sun    critical mass in a flash    there's nowhere left to run    music of america    the soundtrack of the bored    devoid of feeling, without meaning    i've heard it all before   where's daphne.   velma: there's daphne. the green blip.  oh, no. we've got to help her.  uhh.  uhh.    oh, this darn shoe.   come on. come on.  got ya.   like, don't look down, daph.  i wonder why the alien didn't follow me across the gangplank.  ha ha ha.  maybe you got happenin' karma.  or maybe that alien is a big phony.  oh, no. my worm farm.  someone broke it.  grrrr.  hee hee hee.  that's too bad about your project, velma.  but right now i think we have bigger problems.   the alien.  there's only one way to find out.  hey, let go of me, you big jerk.  elliot. elliot.  did you do this to my project.  so what if i did.  your project was stupid.  that's it.  i say elliot is the alien.  hey, not so fast, velma.  there's still one suspect we haven't investigated.  why would keith dale not want to see the shuttle launch.  i don't know, but if he is behind this, we're gonna find out.  hey, look at this.  it's keith's internet password.  " so.  so, razorchuck.  maybe dale wasn't always keith's last name.  here's an article.  it looks like keith razorchuck was a pretty good scientist.  and look at thisan article he wrote about artificial intelligence.  that's what janet won the nobel prize for.  it looks like they were both working on the same idea, but janet published her research first.  so, if keith lost the nobel prize to janet, maybe he's trying to get revenge by sabotaging her new project.   hey, who do you think is creeping around in the divetank room at this time of night.  ralien.  yep. my thought exactly.  ohh. yike.  we better tell the gang about this.  daphne: now, what would a janitor be cleaning in here.  and why so late at night.  this doesn't look right.  we need to get a closer look at the surveillance camera.  uhh, almost got it.  aah. uhh.  like, help.  what's that.  oh, i forgot all about the dehydrated food i shoved in my pockets.  the water must've caused it to expand.  hmm. interesting.  and this looks like some sort of radio transmitter that's hooked into the security system.  that janitor must've put it here.  well, i think i got this mystery just about figured out.  there's only one thing left to do.  capture that alien.  ok, now, it's very simple.  ha ha. wheeee.  hey, ronald. come on, let's go play.  oh, i wish i could, but i have to go to work.  bye. bye, ronald.  .    okay, here i am at work.  now we can play. woohoo. yay.  . ba da ba ba ba .  whoa. wahahaha.  when the alien runs in daphne will hit the floodlights, blinding him.  the alien will slip down this ramp toward the open cockpit of the centrifugal force machine.  velma will seal the door, while i throw the switch from up there in the control room.  looks like the only thing we need now is someone to lure the alien into this room.  uhuh. i see where this is going.  scoob and i are not gonna be bait.  not this time.  uhuh.  would you do it forsorry, daphne. we're way ahead of you.  we brought our own supply of scooby snax just for such an emergency.  ..  oh, man.  nothing goes better with scooby snax than milk.  like, way to show a united front, scoobydoo.  remember that triple creaturefeature we saw last week.  well, if i learned anything, it's that aliens like to hide in vents.  like, hand me that screw driver, would you, scoob.   so much for the movies.  ha ha ha. run.   i think i hear someone coming.  throw the lights, daphne.  aah.   ok, freddy.  that's enough.  it's time to find out who our alien really is.  all: janet lawrence.  professor lawrence. but why.  because her project wasn't ready.  instead of facing the humiliation of admitting her mistake, she decided to keep the space shuttle from launching by coming up with this alienegg scam.  that's why she didn't want us looking at her data.  freddy: and that's why she wouldn't chase daphne across the gangplank at the top of the tower.  because janet is afraid of heights.  and the makeup i found in the lab did belong to janet.  but it wasn't makeup at all.  it was an allergy powder that caused that strange rash on captain treesdale.  and only someone with a degree in biochemistry could come up with a freaky compound like that.  huh.  great work, kids.  but how do you explain the shorter alien.  that couldn't have been janet.  the short version was reggie the chimp wearing the alien suit.  then janet wore the costume herself for the medium version, and then used stilts to make it appear the alien was growing for the tall version.  but thanks to shaggy, there was one final clue which put it all together for me.  when he fell in the tank and all his food ..  it made me realize that the alien egg was nothing more than dehydrated organic material.  when janet wanted to make it look like it was hatching all she had to do was add a little water.  and i would've gotten away with it if it weren't for you meddling kids.  unh. ohh.  ow.  ahh. uhh.  ohh.  fred: but who are you.  my name is celia clyde.  i'm an fbi agent.  i was sent here to monitor possible alien activity.  velma: sorry we had to unmask your alien.  that's all right.  this alien might've been a fake, but out there somewhere, maybe watching us right now, are extraterrestrials waiting to make contact.  like, you aren't kidding.  look.  there it goes.  it's too bad your experiment isn't going with it, velma.  that's ok.  there's always next year.  but come to think of it, what happened to my worms.  these chinese noodles sure look great.  huh, scoob.  huh.  uhuh, uhuh.   gross.  scoobydoobyeeh, yecch.

star patrol. they're signaling me.  ruff, ruff, and away.  i came as fast as i could what's the mission.  some students on a field trip ..  and it's heading straight for the sun.   sacre blue cheese.  we gotta save those kids before they're extra crispy.  well, how did they get stranded.  i sense their school ship has run out of fuel, and has a flat tire, and the teacher locked his keys inside.  blimey. must be a substitute teacher.  they're down there.  we'll have your ship fixed in no time.  we really will.   voila. the door, she is open.  one flat inflated.  and a free fillup on us.  hey, these kids are cardboard.  fake kids. what the dickens.  ha ha. mechanikat.   welcome to my fiendishly clever trap, dog stars.  but wait, there's more.  ahem. that's your cue, snooky.  ha.  uhh. what

to affect superdog.  now the dog stars are harmless pups.  i can finally conquer the universe without them stopping me.  hi. who are you.  why, i'm your pappy.  i've come to pick you up from school and take you home.  you don't look like a daddy dog.  uh, ruff ruff.  what's my name, pappy.  me first.  wah. wah.  brainy barker, hot dog, tusky husky, bulldog, superdog, and you are mammoth mutt.  we've got to go back to your beautiful home planet, where dog biscuits grow on trees and the streets are paved with bacon.   and leave them there.   this is the easiest evil scheme i've hatched in light years.   )
