 sadly, yes.  i started out directing this teenspy beach movie.  ea but it's turning into a horror film, thanks to that faceless phantom.  faceless phantom.  gco tordindi tu so legend, the ghost of movie idol rick bannon has haunted le tuckbaot ever since he was lost in a tragic fire, ck ma ea ynyrs ago.  y oh ri us role was in the deac rivers teen superspy film t spy me a river.  the very film we're remaking.  looks like we're notki mareng anything.  no stunt team, no movie.  ok. all done here. thanks. bye.  no no no. don't go.  stay ma we'll do the stunts.  we're always in crazy situations.  right, gang.  sure.  if we were the stunt team, that would keep us close to the action.  uh, it's a bit unorthodox.  ok, let's get you to wardrobe.  our costumer, vikki, will make you look the part in no time.  i have just one little word for this idea.  nonono.  noncer ] skin.  it's in your future now.   discover the power of aveeno positively radiant.  with total soy, it's clinically proven to visibly reduce past damage while advanced spf 30 helps prevent future damage.  aveeno positively radiant.  but, shaggy, you look fabulous in this.  blue certainly doesn't cramp your style.  i'm not worried about cramping my style.  i'm worried about breaking my neck.  chip hernandez jr. is counting on us.  i can hear his dreamy voice even now.  shh. that is his voice. listen.  chip: it really is that bad.  i want off this picture, sid.  i can't follow up a mega hit like the modem with this piece of teen fluff.  dude, make it happen or i walk.  i loved the modem.  who'd have thought an exciting scifi picture could take place inside a fax machine.  i wonder.  daphne: velma, you can't suspect chip.  en ev shaggy: like he may be a wolf in chip's clothing.  ha ha ha ha ha.  ahchoo.  aah. aah.  freddy: split up, gang.   hey. scooby. shaggy.  what's going on here.  like, ask him.   rowl the phantom. well.  ro i'm not going to let a small detail like the ghost of a disfigured teen idol stop me.  let's start rolling.  right on, vincent. we're with you.  scooby, where you going.   what do you know.  that spooky samurai armor.  good going, scoob.  shh.  what's roderick kingston doing in chip hernandez jr.'s trler.  guard: hey, you.  who's there.  let me see your lot pass.  uhuh, ha ha ha ha. don't shoot.  i'm wearing studio property.  oh, itwo y tou.  well, i heard the phantom was around here.  hmm. i wonder what he could want.  like, maybe a dressing room.  i guess studio phantoms don't get their own trailers.  like, i'd rather have a limo.  uhhuhh.  it's no use, fred.  your head's just too big t to fit into chip's helmet.  hu h, too much brain, i guess.  then we're just going to have toin d some ae thwi smaller head.  th what. whatever it is, i'm not gonna do it.  mmm, delicious.  but i still don't want to do it.  shaggy is right.  he can't possibly do the stunt like this.  ah, finally, sanity prevails.   it's a much better stunt with the dog on the back.  waitwait. this isn't in the script.  iii didn't write this.  it doesn't make any sense.  trust me. it's better like this.  ok. places.  roll sound.  and action.  no worries, pal.  we are not budging.  whoa.  velma: i never thought i'd see scoobydoo jump the shark.   aah. aah.  abandon this film or face my wrath.  you ok, shaggy.  talk about a bad facelift.  that guy had his face lifted clean off.  did you get it.  were we rolling.  that was gold. pure gold.  man: aah.  that came from chip's trailer.  come on. hurry.  chip, are you all right.  what happened.  what's wrong.  what's wrong.  look at my face.  my beautiful face.  it can't be my makeup.  it's hypoallergenic.  mmm. avocado.  i'm allergic to avocado.  that's it, man. i quit.  you can't walk off this movie.  we got a contract.  contract or no contract, i'm done.  hmph. spoiled brat.  hmm.  looks like the only way to get film in can today, is to shoot more stunts.  you game, fred.  i'm in.  ok, freddy, remember, you're deac rivers, teen superstar.  and you're crossing the bridge of death into dr. bikini's inferno lair.  halfway across, you're attacked by an angry swarm of bees.  your costume will protect you a little, but act scared. ok.  scared. right.  roll 'em. places.  everyone settled.  and action.  cue bees.  shaggy: oh, no. it's the faceless phantom.  that bee suit won't protect freddy for long.  come on.  you'll be ok.  there's first aid ointment in the security office.  i think shaggy and scooby are gonna need a lot more than i do.  aah. oh. mmm, honey.  hey, guys, look what i found.  an old scrap book filled with pictures of classic movie stars.  velma: looks like old pete's been saving these clippings as souvenirs.  freddy: look, here's a photo of rick bannon.  the faceless phantom, himself.  shaggy: yeah, like, back when he had a face.  there's a whole bunch of rick bannon photos.  what would old pete be doing with these.  velma, you're needed on the set.  right now.  ok, velma, we're ready for you.  come on. you look great.  i can't do it.  everyone will be looking at me.  yeah. isn't it great.  ready for your stunt.  i was so mortified by the costume, i forgot to be nervous about that.  what am i doing.  all you have to do is jump off this ledge, and freefall until these nearly invisible you're finished.  yeah. that's what i was afraid of.  do you want a scooby snack.  ready up there ..and action.  here goes nothing.  jinkies.  ok. everything's fine.  perfectly safe.  falling according to plan.   that wasn't a part of the plan.  jinkies.  aah. aah.  hang in there, velma.  aah. aah.  ok, scoob. let her rip.  good catch, shaggy.  who would have thought the emergency nap center i installed for shaggy, would be used in an actual emergency.  man, like, when i need a nap bad, that is an emergency.   that's strange.  your harness and wires look fine.  it wasn't sabotage.  like, fred, if those are velma's wires, whose are these.  hmm. an extra set of wires.  looks like velma wasn't the only one using special affects to fall.  that explains why the phantom just hung there for a minute, after the bridge collapsed.  our faceless phantom is a phony fake.  and you know what that means.  that we phone the cops and head to the beach.  that we flush out that makebelieve mischief maker.  looks like the man with the van has got a plan.  i'd, like, ratgerta a t n.  n.  yo, vincent.  i'm, like, back.  oh. the prodigal star returns.  bizarre.  so, you're back to finish the movie.  why the change of heart.  my lawyer said i had to.  good enough for me.  people, we're about to shoot the most exciting climax, ever.  so let's focus.  daphne, you'll be doubling for deac rivers' flirtatious love interest and russian military contactmajor smoochie.  bikini's minions and land on the speeding train where deac is bound and gagged.  save him, then we cut.  roll camera.  cue train and action.    like, sorry, mr. faceless, sir.  believe me. this wasn't my idea.  ..now.  good work, freddy. you got him.  oops. you don't got him.  is there a plan "b," freddy.  yeah.  run.   i don't go out with you    i don't wanna walk around with you    i don't wanna walk around with you      ooh ooh ooh    i don't wanna walk around with you    ooh ooh ooh    i don't wanna walk around with you    i don't wanna walk around with you    i don't wanna walk around with you    i don't wanna walk around with you      ooh ooh ooh    i don't wanna walk around with you    ooh ooh ooh    i don't wanna walk around with you   all right.   i don't wanna walk around with you    i don't wanna walk around with you    i don't wanna walk around with you      ooh ooh ooh    i don't wanna walk around with you    ooh ooh ooh    i don't wanna walk around with you   all:.  i'm befuddled, bewildered and befogged.  what's going on here.  it's all very simple.  we arranged for chip to pretend to return to the movie in order to act as bait.  but how did you know chip himself wasn't the phantom.  because chip can't do anything.  the phantom could scale walls, do acrobatics and seem to fly.  chip can't even act.  ..  check out my cheekbones.  we knew the phantom must be someone trying to shut down the production, but that could still be anybody.  yeah. spy me a river.  blecch.  come on. nobody wants to make this picture.  especially vincent wong.  an important hong kong action director dreams of making an american film and gets stuck with this.  then i remembered that vincent started his career at the peking opera school.  from childhood, the students are trained to do amazing feats, which come in handy in the world of hong hong action films or creating a convincing faceless phantom.  it's true.  i was so excited to make a hollywood movie, i didn't even read the script till after i signed on.  by then it was too late.  .  then i thought if enough people quit, the studio will shut us down and i'd get to direct a different movie.  so you played up the old studio legend about the faceless phantom.  yes.  ..so...sorry.  scooby's right.  you were with us when the phantom chased us around in that samurai suit.  yeah. i'm afraid that was me, shaggy.  i been keepin' a close eye on every aspect of this movie.  but, like, why.  because old pete is really rip bannon.  isn't that right, rip.  'fraid so.  you see, spy me a river was my biggest film.  i just wanted to see it done right.  you see, way back whenduring that fire, nobody saw meget out of there.  t bu my facei'd been so handsomei couldn't let my public see me.  notnot likelike this.  why, pete, it's the tiniest scar i've ever seen.  it's barely even noticeable.  you really think so.  i suppose i'd rather go to jail than to have my name on this movie.  jail. what for.  nobody got hurt.  you were only using your mastery of theatrical effects to scare us.  i just hated this movie so much.  hunh. join the club, dude.  maybe there's a way this could work out for all of us.   velma: a real, live movie premiere.  daphne: talk about glamorous.  in vincent wong's the modem ii.  freddy: congratulations.  it looks like you've got a big hit on your hands.  well, we wouldn't have gotten away with it if it weren't for you wonderful, meddling kids.  and scoobydoo.  hey, where is scooby.  ..  jumbo popcorn.  scoobydoobydoo.  shaggy: on second thought, ha, hold the popcorn animation department ofondupo cati    we're coming after you    we're gonna solve that mystery    i see you, scoobydoo    the trail leads back to you        gotta follow you    you're gonna solve that mystery    we see you, scoobydoo   .   we're coming after you      come on back    you may find another clue    scooby snax will be waiting here for you      we're coming after you    we're gonna solve that mystery    i see you, scoobydoo    the trail leads back to you      nana nana na    nana nana na    nana na na nana na    nana nana na nana nana na   animation department of education i'm warning you.  try to break my record, and everyone shall suffer.  huh.  shaggy:"cookie company international " what a great namefor a ball field.  yeah, cookie.   i thoughtit used to be called potter stadium.  it was,before potter stadium's 100yearold foundation gave out and it sunk into the ground.  in fact, cookie companyinternationapark was built right on topof the old stadium.  at i can't believei actually get to meet luis santiago.  yeah, me, too, fred.  ha ha. like, who is he.  he's only the bestlong ball hitter in baseball today.  he's one home run awayfrom breaking the alltime record.  rizzly bear.ruff ruff ruff ruff.  no, scooby.  that's just mr. grizz, the team mascot.  rrr, rrr, rrr.  hey, let go, ya mutt.  like, usually it takes a lot longer before we're unmasking people.  hee hee hee. sorry.  hey, aren't you j.t. page.  i thought you were a pitcher on this team.  yeah, i was, but then i got cut.  i remember that.  didn't you throw a burrito at someone in the stands.  not exactly my finest hour.  they told me the only way i could stay with the club is if i became the new mascot, mr. grizz.  cool. my name is frenejos.  i won the "meet luis santiago" contest.  ..we're here to meet luis santiago.  yeah. he's right over there.  well, luis, it's been a tough couple of weeks for ya.  any thoughts on how to break out of this drought you're in.  ..well, bob, you used to play. you know what it's like.  i'll come out of it, i'm sure.  excuse me, luis.  i'm fred jones, the contest winner.  well, fred, i see you brought some friends with you.  uhhuh. this is velma, daphne, and shaggy.  and scoobydoo.  nice to meet you all.  so remember that game against san jose where you went 5 for 8 in extra innings and won the game with a walkoff home run.  ..  that was so cool.  and remember the time that you were down 3 runs to portland in the bottom of the ninth.  umpire: strike 2.  announcer: strike 3.  and that's all for the grizzlies in the second.  here you go, shaggy.  she gave you all that stuff for free, shaggy.  uhhuh.  why.  like, beats me.  she even said she'd stop by every inning just to see how i was doing. ha ha ha.  that is one dedicated peanutsoftserveicecreampizza girl.  oh, no. it's starting to rain.  your hair won't get wet.  cookie company international park has a retractable roof.  actually, i was worried about a rainout.  the grizzlies would have to make up the game with a doubleheader.  we're 1 and 17 in those.  and i did just get my hair done.  announcer: ok, grizz fans, steve powell here to call the bottom of the second.  the first pitch to luis santiago is just on the outside corner for a strike.  i warned you.  now everyone will suffer.  aaahhh.  aah. aah.  rraah. hee hee ha.  and so he told me that if i tried to break the record, he'd make bad things happen here at the park.  that's why i've been pretending to be in a slump.  any idea who this baseball bogeyman might be.  of course.  he's the ghost of the alltime home run leader cab craig.  .  luis, honey, that was great.  well, not great great, but you know what i mean.  we're not only the lead story on sports station, but the evening news, too.  this is my publicist, autumn summerfield.  i'm fred, and this is daphyeah, yeah, wonderful for you.  look, luis, we need to move on this while the story is hot.  no pun intended. ha ha.  maybe luis should rest up before the big game.  ..what are you doing.  looking for the nametag that says "luis' " and i don't see it, so buzz off.  autumn, give it a rest. daphne's right.  we'll talk about it in the morning.  you concentrate on baseball and leave the crime solving to us.  we're gonna bring that phony phantom to justice.  and the first thing we need to do is get a closer look at those exploding lights.  make sure to stay attached to these safety lines.  it sure is a long way down to the field.  take a look at this.  but that doesn't make sense.  a generator that small couldn't run all these lights.  no, but if the lights were already running, it could overload them.  causing them to explode.  you know what my favorite kind of food is, scoob, old buddy, old friend, old pal.  uhuh.  stadium food.   burying leftovers for later.  uhhuh.  good idea. here, i'll give you a hand.   hey, i wonder where this goes. )
