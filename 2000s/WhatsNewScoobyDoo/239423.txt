we need to trap him before he gets away.  all we need are some large feathers, a really strong vacuum andjust use a net.  oh, yeah, sure, if you want to do it the easy way.  unh. argh.  ..  crusty mcpeet.  verona, just because he was running away doesn't mean that he's behind this.  no, but this just might.  it's a remote control for those scary skeletons.    scooby & shaggy: aah.  it's just verona controlling them.  that's what the small motors in crusty's shop were for.  very good, velma. you figured out a clue.  grr.  all right, it's true.  i created the ghost ship because i discovered the resting place of the dauntless.  i've been using the old legend to scare people off so i could dive for her treasure.  and i would've gotten away with it if it weren't for that meddling kid.  wow, verona. you really thought of everything.  yeah. everything.  shaggy: manha ha. that verona sure is smart.  she solved the whole case by herself.  and not only is she great at solving crimes, but her long underwear is so amazing.  velma, feel this imported fabric.  daphne, i don't want to foh.  wait. this mystery isn't over yet. others: what.  crusty mcpeet may have been behind the ghost ship, but he didn't confess to being the creepy lighthouse keeper.  fred, we're gonna need a trap.  finally.  ok, the trap is set.  all we need now is some live bait.  no way. hmph. no. hmph.  you don't have to do this.  .  finally someone listens to us, huh, scoob.  reah. hee hee hee.  oh, by the way, i don't know if i told you.  but, uh, i heard the creepy keeper say that scooby snax were the worsttasting, foulestsmelling snack he's ever seen.  . he said he wouldn't eat them if they were the last snack food on earth.  scooby, the door.  grr.  heh heh heh. good one, freddy. heh heh heh.  yeah, thanks. hey, i've been saving the one.  so do you want me to explain how the trap works.  we'll trust you.   here they come.  darn trap didn't work.  whoopsie. whoa.   hey, hey, ho    straight through the heart i'm for you    and i know you're there for me    give me high 5    hey, ho, friends till the end    can't you see that's the way it's gotta    even though we're hitting 20    and we haven't yet matured    you know, i think it's kind of funny    that we're all a bunch of nerds    hey, ho    straight through the heart i'm for you    and i know you're there for me    give me high 5    hey, ho    friends till the end    can't you see that's the way it's gotta    here we go, hey, ho    straight through the heart i'm for you    and i know you're there for me    give me a high 5, hey, ho    friends till the end    can't you see that's the way it's gotta    hey, hey, ho    straight through the heart i'm for you    and i know you're there for me    give me high 5    hey, ho    friends till the end    can't you see that's the way it's gotta   grr. huh.   argh.  huh.  yikes.  argh.  ulp.  argh.  velma: now we'll see who the culprit really is.  others:.  but why.  it came to me when daphne said that verona used imported material for her long underwear.  the only way to get imported anything in this town is through that port.  verona dressed up as the creepy keeper so she could turn on the lighthouse only when her shipments were due to arrive.  that way her business would thrive while her competition would go under.  wow. the perfect crime.  only i didn't count on one thing: velma dinkley.  hey, i was the one who set the trap.  not now, freddy.  but like what about the creepy van that was creeping around creeping me out.  well, shaggy, i did a little research and found out that van belongs to an association of storm chasers, scientists who were hoping to be here for another perfect storm.  well, i knew that, too. i swear i did.  you guys believe me, right. right.  velma dinkley.  still the best meddler in town.  well, i hope that's the last we've seen of verona dempsey.  you know, she kind of reminded me of someone, but i just can't put my finger on it.  both: heh heh heh.  your uncle is back in business.  and guess who's first in line.  uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuhhuh. hee hee hee.  scoobydoobydoo.  heh heh heh.  ani heads down gainesville's back straight at over 220

gainesville 500 is the biggest race i've ever qualified for.   ..reset.   let's get to work, guys.  i want every inch of this race car checked, cleaned, filled, lubed, bolted, tightened, and polished.  let's go.  scoob and i will get the tool chest.  daphne: careful, shaggy, it's heavy.  .  you've got everything there but your blowdryers, girlie girl.  matt fury's my name, and you watch yourself around here.  i'm crew chief for the ricky burdick.  who.  .. ah, you'll learn his name when you see it on top of the leader board.  nobody's beatin' my driver.  that guy's a couple quarts short of an oil change.  how's the car, fred.  it's as smooth asskeleton: hello, fred.  ..  "goodbye".  daphne, your voice sounds kinda funny.  do you have a cold orooh, jeez.  jinkies. what is that thing.  it's either a monster truck or a truck monster, and, like, i don't know which is worse.  step on it, fred.  aah. ahoh.  bwa ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.   come on, gang. let's get that scurrying skeleton.   where did he go.  well, if it ain't my good buddy fred.  it's burr batson.  we raced against him in mexico at the enduro slam 5,000.  any chance you own a skeleton suit.  nice try, little lady, but burr batson has nothin' to do with the monster truck that's been hauntin' this track.  haunting. haunting.  oh, yeah, that ghost driver's been smashin' up cars pretty bad, knockin' the best drivers out of the race.  heck, old champ truman retired after what happened to him.  but don't worry, fred.  that skeleton driver's not goin' after the amateurs.  ha ha.  ladies.  jeepers.  maybe it's too dangerous for you to race this weekend, freddy.  like, yeah, the only race we should do is race the heck outta here.  uhhuh.  hang on, guys.  i've been training for months.  that trophy is mine.  well, then that means we have a mystery to solve.  oh, great, not only do we have to deal with a spooky skeleton, but this one's got a driver's license.  daphne: so where's our hotel.  we're staying here at the track.  because there's a hotel here i just can't ..  please.  fred: the mystery machine now sleeps 5, thanks to a few modifications i made.  ..  our new bedrooms.  oops. wrong button.  ..bedrooms.  i meant to label these things, really.  ehh, it could be a wiring problem.
