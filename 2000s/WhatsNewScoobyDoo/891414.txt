whoa. whoa.  hang on.  thanks for the warning, freddy.  velma:" like, jimmy.  like, shaggy.  ha ha ha ha. ha ha ha ha.  jimmy proudwolf, this is velma, daphne, and fred.  hello. hi, there.  and you remember scooby.  no way. check out shooby.  no way.  like, maybe we better get inside.   uh, expecting rain.  if it were only that.  baa. baa. baa.  baa. baa. baa.  this statue of scooby is for a sculpture show in santa fe.  no way. i'm kind of an artist now, too.  i make dream catchers and sell them to anyone who shares their vibes.  no way.    you two are like 2 soybeans in a pod.  ha ha ha ha.  like, we've been buddies since we met at the redwood rabbit daycare center.  jimmy tied me for most gold stickers in naptime.  but shaggy was the allsticker champion in snacktime.  no way.  uh, coming up here, like, you didn't notice anything unusual in the skies, did you.  just the beautiful new mexico cloud formations.  there was one shaped like boxer shorts.  maybe we should get scooby and shooby inside, too.  they seem to be having so much fun up on that hillside.   that's why.   huh. huh.  roh.  fred: run, scooby. run.  shaggy: hey, you big bird, leave him alone.    whoa.  velma: let me guess.  that was the unusual thing in the sky.  i thought seeing boxer shorts was strange.  that feathered fiend snatched shaggy's sculpture of scooby.  better than snatching the real thing.  roo said it.  excuse me, have you seen a giant, vicious hookclawed birdy.  only one today.  .  it flew away.  ..chirp.  fred: and you are.  hi, i'm avery orenthall, lifelong bird watcher.  seen every rare north american bird.  checked them off this card.  even the spinebilled dickey grebe.  now, i've heard about this foulfeathered fowl never yet watched by any bird watcher, and i'm going to be the watcher who watches it.  i gotta fly.  so, jimmy, maybe now's a good time to tell us what's going on around here.  like, i wish i knew.  that's thing's appeared a few times lately.  just yesterday a man from the reservation ..  it carried him away.  how horrible.  yeah. my people are really bummed.  they've called or a travelling shaman to speak to us tonight in the sweat lodge.  he speaks while you sweat.  it's where we go to search for the big answers.  searching for answers is right up our alley.  would you mind if we joined you in the sweat lodge.  sure. everyone's welcome.  you'll get to learn about our problem.  i'll also get to make up for missing my spa session.  the anasazi people who made their homes in the caves above your villagethey all disappeared 1,300 years ago.  nobody knows where they went.  now, they really had a mystery on their hands.  shh.  ok.  in their caves we find the pictographs, the wall paintings.  they show a gigantic flying beast.  it is the wakumi.  it is a dreadful spirit from anasazi legend.  it did not want intruders climbing up the mountain to the sacred hunting grounds of the gods.    did it scare away the anasazi.  we will never know the answer.  has the wakumi returned for your people.  you don't want to know the horror.    jeepers. jinkies.   whoa. aah.  whoa. unh.  what we need is a 500pound cat.  sorry about your poor, broken sculpture, shaggy.  scoob will just pose for another one.  i heard the commotion.  have you seen a great, gliding grabber.  i came up with that name myself.  you missed it again.  it flew up to that mountain.  oh. chirp and tweet.  strange how that bird watcher always seems to be missing his bird.  is that where the cliff dwellings are.  jimmy: yeah, man.  the anasazi lived in the caves above the reservation.  and the mountain continues a mile beyond that.  can you and shooby take us up there, jimmy.  uh, we're kinda scared of heights.  but, like, there's this girl on the reservation who's a total expertcody long.  she'll help you scale any dizzying, slippery, sheerdrop, milehigh mountain.  those ladders have been here for hundreds of years.  too bad they didn't have escalators.  mmhmm.  thanks, cody.  wow.  those must be the pictures the shaman was talking about.  cody: they're called pictographs they tell the stories of the people's lives, wars, hunts, and legends.  hmm, there doesn't seem to be a pictograph of a big wakumi bird.  uhhuhh.  ohwhoa. whoa.  ahchoo.  whoa.  what a pretty feather.  i wonder what kind of bird it belonged to.  i'd say it came from some sort of hawk.  a hawk feather.  that could be considered an evil omen.  it could also be considered a clue.  what's right above these caves.  the upper mesas.  flatlands where the anasazi farmed far above their enemies.  could you lead us up higher, cody, where the old anasazi had a farm.   eeieeioh   eeieeioh   hee hee hee hee. ha ha ha ha.  shaggy: well, of all the creepy, ghostly places we've ever been, this is definitely the highest creepy, ghostly place.  daphne: what's on that ledge up there.  something shining.  let's climb up there and check it out.  we're already higher than i'm supposed to take you.  oh, that's ok.  i can get up there by myself.  she shouldn't go up to that ledge.  it's not safe with that terrible creature flying around.  but we're gonna find out what it is.   this is weird.  heads up.  an oxygen tank.  why would that be up here.   daphne, look out.  aah.   aah.  yikes. it's got her.  cody: it's heading for those peaks.  we've got to save daphne.  i can't lead you up where the evil spirits reign.  she sure doesn't seem to want us on that mountain.  then i'll take us up.  ..  till the bear took my clothes.  velma: the guide book said the top of this mountain is wheeler peak, the very highest point in new mexico.  think climbing, guys.  velma: when you're hundreds of feet up on the sheer face of a mountain wall, there's nothing else to think about.  except, maybe, lunch.  got you covered, shaggy.  freeze dried scooby snax.  just swallow.  sounds like regular scooby snax.  try some, scoob.  baaaa.  velma: the air up here is getting thin.  we might start feeling lightheaded.  maybe that's why i'm seeing a mountain made of peanut butter.   voice: turn back. turn back.  " turn back. turn back.  turn back.  so, was that a real vision or a vision vision.  we can't turn back if we want to get to daphne.  this is getting harder and harder.  maybe it has something to do with that snoring sound.   well, maybe we all need a rest.   look.  shaggy, scooby.  huh.  uhoh. uhoh.  whoa.   living out loud    tearing my eyes out    burning memories burning out    drink me away into the next day    dilute yourself, it's all the same    this record skips, my heart trips    drink your conscience to feel your soul    no control    no control    drink your conscience to feel your soul    no control    no control    drink your conscience to feel your soul    reflect the lie    change the light    there are always 2 sides    too many shadows    too many echoes    i can't control, feel my soul    no control    no control    drink your conscience to feel your soul    everyone safe and sound.  sound, maybe, but not safe.   aah.   we made it.  now, where do you think we'll find daphne.  maybe trapped in some giant bird's nest.  that's no bird's nest.   .  onthe .  do you dare to enter roarrr .  the imaginextdragon world fortress .  you can turn the knightto open the gate find thefortress secrets or releasethe hidden dragon...  whoa .  ...and dispose ofunwanted guests.  oh no .  . imaginext turns onthe adventures .  look out .  yeah .  i could go for a little "knight"time snack . ahhh .  imaginext dragon world fortresscomes as you see here.  other dragons and accessoriessold separately.  daphne must be up here somewhere.    i think there's something up in that tree.  chirp.  what are you doing up here.  i'm finally going to see it.  oh, chirp, chirp, chirp.  so you know what's going on up here.  who cares.  what's important is the shame and disgrace of not seeing that big birdy.  i plan to lure it with this mating call no. no. stop.    man, on p.a.: trespassers have breached the perimeter.   aah.  whoa. whoa.  whoa. whoa. whoa.   daphne.  oh, i never thought you'd find me up here.  this is leon strongfeather, the missing explorer that jimmy told us about.  can you get us out.  who are those people in the scary uniforms.  some sort of secret organization.  i overheard them talking about a meteor shower that could have brought otherworldly life forms.  shaggy: zoinks.  that does sound pretty weird.  no, i mean that zoinks.   aah. aah.  we'll be right back for you, daphne.  ..  run for our lives.   there must be some connection between that wakumi and the secret activity up here.  the only way we're gonna get daphne off this mountain is if we could fly.  i'm way ahead of you, shaggy.  some fallen tree limbs, a few tent tarps, a wad of gum peeled off my shoe, and voilaa hang glider for 5.  huh.  so, we're supposed to get on something that was just thrown together from stuff in the woods and jump it over that very high cliff, just on pure faith in fred. right.  can i have a second to thinkaah.   whoa. whoa. whoa.  whoo. whoo.  everybody lean to the left.   the wakumi.   hold tight.  whoa. whoa.  rhoah.  scooby. scooby.    ooh. ow. oh.  a perfect 3point landing.  too bad this thing has 5 landing points.  it's just a great big glider.  oxygen tanks, like the one i found.  they must be for breathing in the high altitudes.  time to reveal our finefeathered fanatic.  ..  all: nobody we know.  you're that mystical shaman.  actually, colonel henry thorwall, commander of the research site.  like, were you really checking out outerspace life forms on that meteor.  my scientists may have discovered and extraterrestrial breakthrough.  it's been kept top secret from even the u.s. government.  so, why are you telling us.  nobody's gonna believe a bunch of meddling kids.  we'll see about that.  so, the wakumi is not from the anasazi cave legends.  he made it up to scare people away from the mountain.  and if anybody got too close, he carried you away to that big, bad bird coop.  well, now we're carrying him away to the authorities below.  oh, i'll never check that big wakumi off my card.  i won't be able to hold my head up again.  then hold this up.  chirp. chirp. chirp.  like, welcome back safe and sound.  i made these dreamcatchers for you guys so you can bliss out on your sweetest dreams.  and from shooby, a special farewell treat.  shaggy: wow. shooby snax.  like, i just wish i still had my sculpture of scoob for the exhibit tomorrow.  like, no problem.  think back, man, to our days in the sandbox.  everyone at this exhibit sure likes my lifelike statue of scoob.  scoobydoobydoo.

sculpture, shaggy.  scoob will just pose for another one.  i heard the commotion.  have you seen a great, gliding grabber.  i came up with that name myself.  you missed it again.  it flew up to that mountain.  oh. chirp and tweet.  strange how that bird watcher always seems to be missing his bird.  is that where the cliff dwellings are.  jimmy: yeah, man.  the anasazi lived in the caves above the reservation.  and the mountain continues a mile beyond that.  can you and shooby take us up there, jimmy.  uh, we're kinda scared of heights.  but, like, there's this girl on the reservation who's a total expertcody long.  she'll help you scale any dizzying, slippery, sheerdrop, milehigh mountain.  those ladders have been here for hundreds of years.  too bad they didn't have escalators.  mmhmm.  thanks, cody.  wow.  those must be the pictures the shaman was talking about.  cody: they're called pictographs they tell the stories of the people's lives, wars, hunts, and legends.  hmm, there doesn't seem to be a pictograph of a big wakumi bird.  uhhuhh.  ohwhoa. whoa.  ahchoo.  whoa.  what a pretty feather.  i wonder what kind of bird it belonged to.  i'd say it came from some sort of hawk.  a hawk feather.  that could be considered an evil omen.  it could also be considered a clue.  what's right above these caves.  the upper mesas.  flatlands where the anasazi farmed far above their enemies.  could you lead us up higher, cody, where the old anasazi had a farm.   eeieeioh   eeieeioh   hee hee hee hee. ha ha ha ha.  shaggy: well, of all the creepy, ghostly places we've ever been, this is definitely the highest creepy, ghostly place.  daphne: what's on that ledge up there.  something shining.  let's climb up there and check it out.  we're already higher than i'm supposed to take you.  oh, that's ok.  i can get up there by myself.  she shouldn't go up to that ledge.  it's not safe with that terrible creature flying around.  but we're gonna find out what it is.   this is weird.  heads up.  an oxygen tank.  why would that be up here.   daphne, look out.  aah.   aah.  yikes. it's got her.  cody: it's heading for those peaks.  we've got to save daphne.  i can't lead you up where the evil spirits reign.  she sure doesn't seem to want us on that mountain.  then i'll take us up.  ..  till the bear took my clothes.  velma: the guide book said the top of this mountain is wheeler peak, the very highest point in new mexico.  think climbing, guys.  velma: when you're hundreds of feet up on the sheer face of a mountain wall, there's nothing else to think about.  except, maybe, lunch.  got you covered, shaggy.  freeze dried scooby snax.  just swallow.  sounds like regular scooby snax.  try some, scoob.  baaaa.  velma: the air up here is getting thin.  we might start feeling lightheaded.  maybe that's why i'm seeing a mountain made of peanut butter.   voice: turn back. turn back.  " turn back. turn back.  turn back.  so, was that a real vision or a vision vision.  we can't turn back if we want to get to daphne.  this is getting harder and harder.  maybe it has something to do with that snoring sound.   well, maybe we all need a rest.   look.  shaggy, scooby.  huh.  uhoh. uhoh.  whoa.   living out loud    tearing my eyes out    burning memories burning out    drink me away into the next day    dilute yourself, it's all the same    this record skips, my heart trips    drink your conscience to feel your soul    no control    no control    drink your conscience to feel your soul    no control    no control    drink your conscience to feel your soul    reflect the lie    change the light    there are always 2 sides    too many shadows    too many echoes    i can't control, feel my soul    no control    no control    drink your conscience to feel your soul    everyone safe and sound.  sound, maybe, but not safe.   aah.   we made it.  now, where do you think we'll find daphne.  maybe trapped in some giant bird's nest.  that's no bird's nest.   .  onthe .  do you dare to enter roarrr .  the imaginextdragon world fortress .  you can turn the knightto open the gate find thefortress secrets or releasethe hidden dragon...  whoa .  ...and dispose ofunwanted guests.  oh no .  . imaginext turns onthe adventures .  look out .  yeah .  i could go for a little "knight"time snack . ahhh .  imaginext dragon world fortresscomes as you see here.  other dragons and accessoriessold separately.  daphne must be up here somewhere.    i think there's something up in that tree.  chirp.  what are you doing up here.  i'm finally going to see it.  oh, chirp, chirp, chirp.  so you know what's going on up here.  who cares.  what's important is the shame and disgrace of not seeing that big birdy.  i plan to lure it with this mating call no. no. stop.    man, on p.a.: trespassers have breached the perimeter.   aah.  whoa. whoa.  whoa. whoa. whoa.   daphne.  oh, i never thought you'd find me up here.  this is leon strongfeather, the missing explorer that jimmy told us about.  can you get us out.  who are those people in the scary uniforms.  some sort of secret organization.  i overheard them talking about a meteor shower that could have brought otherworldly life forms.  shaggy: zoinks.  that does sound pretty weird.  no, i mean that zoinks.   aah. aah.  we'll be right back for you, daphne.  ..  run for our lives.   there must be some connection between that wakumi and the secret activity up here.  the only way we're gonna get daphne off this mountain is if we could fly.  i'm way ahead of you, shaggy.  some fallen tree limbs, a few tent tarps, a wad of gum peeled off my shoe, and voilaa hang glider for 5.  huh.  so, we're supposed to get on something that was just thrown together from stuff in the woods and jump it over that very high cliff, just on pure faith in fred. right.  can i have a second to thinkaah.   whoa. whoa. whoa.  whoo. whoo.  everybody lean to the left.   the wakumi.   hold tight.  whoa. whoa.  rhoah.  scooby. scooby.    ooh. ow. oh.  a perfect 3point landing.  too bad this thing has 5 landing points.  it's just a great big glider.  oxygen tanks, like the one i found.  they must be for breathing in the high altitudes.  time to reveal our finefeathered fanatic.  ..  all: nobody we know.  you're that mystical shaman.  actually, colonel henry thorwall, commander of the research site.  like, were you really checking out outerspace life forms on that meteor.  my scientists may have discovered and extraterrestrial breakthrough.  it's been kept top secret from even the u.s. government.  so, why are you telling us.  nobody's gonna believe a bunch of meddling kids.  we'll see about that.  so, the wakumi is not from the anasazi cave legends.  he made it up to scare people away from the mountain.  and if anybody got too close, he carried you away to that big, bad bird coop.  well, now we're carrying him away to the authorities below.  oh, i'll never check that big wakumi off my card.  i won't be able to hold my head up again.  then hold this up.  chirp. chirp. chirp.  like, welcome back safe and sound.  i made these dreamcatchers for you guys so you can bliss out on your sweetest dreams.  and from shooby, a special farewell treat.  shaggy: wow. shooby snax.  like, i just wish i still had my sculpture of scoob for the exhibit tomorrow.  like, no problem.  think back, man, to our days in the sandbox.  everyone at this exhibit sure likes my lifelike statue of scoob.  scoobydoobydoo.
