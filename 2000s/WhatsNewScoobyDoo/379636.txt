i will be overat ye olde food court.    they say there is a treasure    within the castle wall    but no one's ever found it    and lived to sound the call    for those who seek their fortune    have only met the flame    of a thousandyearold dragon    ol' glassie is her name   gosh, i wonder if that's a true story.  it's just a folk tale.  dragons never really existed.   zoinks. then, like, what's that.  like i said, just a legend.  legend, eh.  did a legend singe my eyebrows clean off.  why, just last night the dragon burned up a local cottage, he did.  see for yourself.  that foul beast is trying to ruin my fair.  your fair.  aye. the name's mcewan.  ewan mcewan, and i own this castle, i do.  looks like you've got a real mystery on your hands, sir.  if you need any helpi do not need help from you rowdy hooligans.  uh, unless you've got 5 smackers for a picture with the fearsome glasburgh dragon.   uh, no, thanks.  hey, not so fast.  you gotta wear a costume at my fair, lady.

your legs, friend.    who knew they had such good gourmet food back in medieval times, scoob.   aaaah. aaaah.   i can bench 220.  shaggy and scooby: yaaaaah.  like, we saw the real scary dragon.

get that spooky dragon out of my head.  .  hey scoob, what do you say we show this guy our ultimate jester magic act.  reah, reah.  watch in amazement as we make these frozen treats disappear.    let the public humiliation commence.  like, this is punishment.  hey, ha ha ha. come back.  we deserve to be punished.   zoinks. but not that much.    looks like this is the end, scoob.  only one thing we can do.  good thinking, guys.  what a waste of perfectly good kebabs.   we've got to distract that thing.  too bad we don't have a damsel in distress.  dragons always go for a damsel in distress.

jamison steven ripley.    i mean, all hail lancelot, king of the fair.   aye.  uh, would you like me to cut the cheese.  i was supposed to play the king this year, then that tv faker shows up and
