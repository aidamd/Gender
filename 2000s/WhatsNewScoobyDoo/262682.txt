barely.  the ride broke down.  i can't believe it happened again.  again.  first it was the parasail, then the cliffdiving simulator, now this.  sir.  sorry, call me sam.  i'm the safety engineer.  when the rides aren't up to snuff, i shut 'em down.  and that's been happening a lot lately.  yeah, since that gremlin of a ghost started showing up.  .  well, folks call it the roller ghoster.  never seen it myself.  whatever did this wasn't a ghost.  i never cared for these newfangled extreme rides anyway.  bungeejumping, thrashing, skydiving.  .  because skydiving is awesome.  until the fan breaks.  that's the problem.  they're too dangerous, too hightech.  the old classic rides were better.  oh, i used to enjoy seein' the kids " well, girls, looks like we've got a mystery on our hands.  i'll say.  let's split up.  velma, you go and see if the sisters " right, and fred and i will take a closer look at some of these rides.  strange things have been happening here.  if you're not careful, the next ride could be your last.    terry. chris.  .  hmm. looks like they ditched us, scoob.  wanna hit some rides until they show up again.  uh, ok.  .  how tall do you have to be .  sorry, kid.  not as sorry as you're gonna be.  where ya goin', scoob.  the ride's this way.  nothing to be afraid of, ol' buddy.  see, it's fun.  aah. aah.  waaah. waaah.  oooh. oooh.  see, scoob, that wasn't sobaaaaaad. aaaaaah.  aaaah. oooooh.  ugh. ugh.  whoaaaa.  whoooaaaaaaa.  hello.  terry. chris. are you here.  hmm.  velma.  oh, there you are.  i was looking for you and your sister.  she's around here some place.  what's wrong.  one of your rides almost made a salad out of me and my friends.  oh, no, the roller ghoster.  .  well, iaah.  this is harry harrison, crusading reporter for thisridestinks.com.  i'm webcasting from the thrill rides theme park, talking to chris about persistent rumors that the park is haunted. chris.  it's not haunted, you muckraking loser.  how do you explain all the socalled accidents.  we're very sorry about that.  we're doing everything we can to make the rides safe.  how do we know you aren't responsible.  wouldn't a big expose about a haunted park .  sure, blame the media.  aaaaah. aaaaah.  keep runnin'.  we're headed for that cliff.  rroooh.  do you think you could run faster for a scooby snack.  reah.  .  reah, reah, reah, reah, reah.  .  monster.  .  .  gone now.  that's ok, we'll catch him.  i don't know.  we've been on almost every ride in the park, and there's not a trace of him anywhere.  then our odds are improving.  ..  it's the fastest roller coaster in the world.  the fastest.  i guess the thrill of riding roller coasters is a girl thing now, huh.  wasting time. must ride coaster.  . why.. why.. why.. why..  too short, little man.  go play on the bumper cars.  i'll get even.  you'll see. you'll all see.  wait up, guys.  i think the rides may have been tampered with.  that's what we're counting on.  we're gonna catch the ghost.  ghost, shmost. this ride's gonna be supersonic.  butaah.  huh.  here we go.  gforce, gforce, gforce.  yeah.  look, look.  roaah.  aaaaaah.  ...  hey, look. all: gilbert.  woo, whoa, woo.  i did it, i did it, with my friend iq.  aw, i really miss that little dude.  try goldfish grahams.  baked with whole grain and a touch of sweetness.  . the snack thatsmiles back .  goldfish.  aaaah. aaaah. rraaaah.  aaaah. aaaah. raaoh.  ugh.  .  my rocket coaster, it's ruined.  update.  the roller ghoster has struck again.  hey.  you're that suspicious guy " velma: look what i found.  .  like, one that has a screw loose.  .  reah.  ha ha ha ha.  gimme that, it's mine.   i didn't do it. it's just my wrench.  you don't have to say another word.  butcome on.  .  to get some answers.  remember the piece of green fur i found.  it proves something very important.  .  easy. it's artificial fur.  velma: which proves the roller ghoster is just someone in a costume.  someone like harry.  .  i need one last thing to confirm my theory.  chris.  .  where do you have the broken rides fixed.  velma: sam.  now, this was a good ride.  it was real fun for the kids.  safe, too, if they didn't jump around too much.  ah, they don't make 'em like this anymore.  .  .  you hate new rides.  it would be easy for you to sabotage them.  it's not him, fred.  ..  it's not.  oh, my bad.  hmm.  velma: the rides weren't really sabotaged.  they were just meant to look sabotaged.  right, sam.  they looked broken, but when i went to fix 'em they were completely safe.  that means my theory is probably right, but we'll need to catch out ghost redhanded to be sure.  i've got just the plan.  all i need is for someone to be the bait.  hey, why's everybody lookin' at us.  really, is there anything we won't do for scooby snacks.  uhuh.  well, scoob, i guess that wraps up the case.  now that we know who the roller ghoster is, there's nothing left to do but call the police from the pay phones near the skate park.  like, how'd i do.  soso.  stay alert, scoob.  now that the roller ghoster thinks that we're onto him, he'll be after us.   aaaah. aaaah.   i've got better things to do    and better things to listen to    than i am ranting and raving on you    it's all of the time now    and it's too late    for you to find reality here    now i want you out of my life    what they say is you're out of your mind    i regret the days gone by    and all my alibis    it makes me want to cry    i want you out of my life    what i'm saying    i'm saying goodbye    yeah    yeah    now i've got you out of my life    and i've got you out of my mind    i regret the days gone by    and all my alibis    it makes me want to drive    out of my life    what i'm saying    i'm saying goodbye    yeah    you're out of my life    what i'm saying    i'm saying goodbye    yeaaahhh   it's all over, roller ghoster.  time to unmask your monstrous mayhem.  " that's not all.  it wasn't green fur we found at the "sky ride," it was hair from a green wig.  all of which proves that the roller ghoster ..  chris.  .  just as i suspected.  but why would my own sister frame me.  maybe because she was jealous.  it's true.  i always did all the work bringing your crazy designs to life, never getting to build any of my own.  did i ever get any credit or even a thank you.  i never thought about it like that.  you never thought at all.  you were easy to frame.  too easy.  velma: that's what tripped you up.  the wrench was way too obvious a clue.  and the green fur, green hair thing.  puhlease.  sort of a green herring.  it isn't fresh.  once sam confirmed that the sabotaged rides were still safe, everything pointed to terry, who wanted to make sure no one really got hurt.  and after her sister was blamed, terry would control the park.  she could build whatever she wanted.  and i would've gotten away with it, too, if it weren't for you meddling kids.  technically, you did get away with it.  velma's right. you didn't do anything illegal.  just rude.  i'm very disappointed in you, terry.  .  no, wait a minute. let's not be hasty.  mom doesn't need to know about this.  chris, wait.  so, how come i wasn't a suspect.  you're too short to wear the costume.  aw, man.  but you know what you're not too short for.  thanks, shaggy.  no problem, pal.  hold on tight.  yeeeahhhh.  aaaah. aaah. aaaaaah.  aaaaaahhh.  we're landing in a giant hot fudge sundae.  yeah, the best rides today are, like, interactive.  we have to eat our way out.  scoobydoobydooo.  animation department captioning made possible byturner entertainment department of education ha ha ha.  why do you do this.  you are so stupid.  stupid. stupid. stupid.  oh, and let's not forgetyou're so stupid.  ow.  oh, yeah.  well, just because i know how to have fun, doesn't mean i'm stupid.  i may not know all that scientifical, mathemological stuff, but i know how to climb a tree, and i know how to pet a kitty just right, and i know how to tie my own shoes, mr. zipperboot.  actually, i feel sorry for you, dexter.  you're like a picklesour and all bottled up in your laboratory.  toil away alone in the dark, searching for answers to questions nobody asked, locked away from the world, never to explore the true mysteries of life.  well, you can keep your cold, sterile little lab.  as for me, theworld is my laboratory.  goodbye, dexter.  i shan't impose on you ever again.  dee dee.  everything you said was true.  i don't want to be a pickle, but i need your help.  show me the way to be free.  show me the way of the dee dee.  all right.  meet me downstairs in 10 minutes.  uh, where exactlywere we supposed to meet.  dee dee: dexter.  dee dee.  yes, my brother. i am here.  are you ready to start a journey of enlightenment.  uh, yes.  good.  discard those wrappings which tie you to the lab. )
