nana nana na nana nana na   animation tv velma: wow, i can't believewe're in moscow for the russian invitationalhockey tournament.  i can't believeshaggy's knee has been poking mein the ribs for an hour.  i mean, you guys have no ideahow much i love hockey.  i really love it.  oh, great, velma.now you're giddy.  breathe, breathe.   hockey arenas.wrestling stadiums.  we sure have eaten a lotof stadium food recently.  stadium food.yummy.  fred: hey,there's the arena.  security sure isintense around here.  you got to admit, these russians sure area friendly people.  move it, johnny longhair.  righteo.   ...freddyski.  your new name will be prisoner 432 if i find any diamonds on you.  hmm, i wonder what that means.   hey, that's u.s. team captain brett hull.  hello, fans.  nice to see some fellow countrymen and countrywomen.  nice to see you. thank you.  i'm daphne.  hockey team play a flex zone defense, or will you drop the wings to close the passing lanes.  um, we usually just kind of go wherever the puck is.  looks like somebody got checked pretty hard into those boards.  that's where the trophy was stolen from.  stolen trophy.  the grand emperor's cup that goes to the tournament winner.  the diamonds covering the cup once belonged to tsar nicolas ii.  they're priceless.  that's why they're searching everyone who goes in and out of the rink.  yep.  that inspector is looking for the frozen fiend.  please tell me that's just a delicious, icy, creamy treat.  the frozen fiend is a former russian hockey player who once missed an easy goal.  it would have won russia the emperor's cup.  he was banished to siberia, where he froze to death.  his ghost has come back to haunt the tournament.  hopefully, now that he has the cup, he won't attack again.  but no one really knows.   5 minutes till game time.  who's up for a quick lap around the ice.  ruhuh.  scooby has been afraid of ice ever since that incident with the hotel icemaker.  you remember, that whole tailfreezing thing.    whoops. we'll have to do it later.  it's goalscoring time.  .. s... a.  .. s... a.  hockey team.  what was your first clue, freddy.   we're the super fans.  we'd do anything to help u.s.a. win the trophy.  anything at all.  whatever it takes.  .. s... a.  catchy.  daphne: the rink doors are opening.  here come the players.  velma: that's not battling brett hull.  that's worldrenowned russian figure skater galina korsekov.  come on. galina.  the first ever to land a quad sowcow triple lutz toe.  oh, jeez. get some culture.  crowd, chanting: hockey. hockey. hockey.   oh, boo all your booing.  boo booing.  rulp.  does welldone mean something different in russian.  this veggie burger is scorched.  shaggy, you're eating a hockey puck.  still, ha ha ha, no such thing as a bad veggie burger.  ruhuh.  uhh.  .. s... a.  exclamation mark.   .  something's gotta be done about finland.  i'll keep the cheers going, guys.  yay. yay.  aah.   ohh.  ha ha ha.  brett needs our help.  we hold hands and make a human chain.  then we grab the fiend when he skates by.   lead him this way, brett.   we got him. we got him.   we don't got him.   you are the one who has summoned this monster, mr. brett.  i did no such thing.  you are setting up this big nonsense so the tournament will be a cancellation.  you are much afraid of losing to russia.  that is ludicrous and ungrammatical.  there sure are a lot of frayed nerves around here.  like, we can all relax, because there's no way that chillin' villain can attack people off the ice.  if that's true, someone better tell him.  raah.  shaggy:  why is it never, like, lenin's pizzeria.  fred: everybody hide.  in here, scoob.    whew.  that was a close one.  but where are shaggy and scooby.  this is a popular hiding spot.  i think he's right out there, so keep quiet, mister.  scooby.   ohh.  awful.  woohoo. it's not the lighting, girlfriend.  mnhmnh. oh gosh.  it's this drab onetone hair color, ick.  yeah. let's szush it up.   try nice 'n easy with colorblend technology.  in one simple step, get a blend of tones and highlights.  so even in this lovely light, nice 'n easy comes to life with dimension.  ..  i love it.  shhhhh.  ...you look fabulous with tones and highlights.  nice 'n easy. your right color.   shaggy and scooby are in there.  it's locked. they're trapped.  stand back, guys.  ice cream. lip balm.  careful, these sour drops i'm going to add are highly carbonated.  scooby and i were a coffin sandwich.  so why is this cool ghoul still attacking people even already stolen the diamond trophy.  and how do we trap him if somehow he can iceskate anywhere.  ..  there's that russian team captain again.  something tells me it's worth keeping an eye on nicolai.  velma: "tsar nicolai ii, the last emperor " this is the guy those trophy diamonds originally belonged to.  he looks just like nicolai.  i'll bet they're related.  so maybe nicolai stole the cup to get back the diamonds that once belonged to his family.  there's other suspects, like the figure skater that everybody booed.  she might have a grudge against the hockey players.  and those super fans.  they said they'd do anything hockey team get the trophy.  gang, i've got a plan.  i'm calling it operation: surveillance.  we all split up and follow different suspects.  whoa. mind meld.  wow.  these super fans really live the dream, huh.  totally. but wait a minute.  " maybe these guys pledge allegiance to the frozen fiend.  fan: a. a.  a. a.  there's no time to hide.  hello. ohh.  hey, what are you two doing in here.  ..we're big u.s.a. fans. right, daphne.  right, but we ran out of blue paint.  so who else could we borrow from but you guys.  but this is the wrong shade of blue.  oh, yeah. that's joe's.  i'm not sure what that's for.  where is joe now.  i don't know.  joe and bob have been acting strange lately.  lately.  yeah.  i worried they're thinking about replacing me.  a.  girl: see you, galina.  ohh.  and then, he said to herhuh.  it's ok.  i'm actually the skating champion of my country.  whoa.  ahem. it's a very small country.  ohh. ohh. ohh. ohh.  this isn't so bad.  me and my big mouth.  aah.  aah. oh.  no loitering, lady.  you come in only if you're buying something.  nicolai's going ice fishing, scoob.  maybe for bait, he's using diamonds.  uhuh. no way.  no.  scoob, the gang is counting on us.  mmmmm. mmmmm.  there's gotta be some way to get you out on the ice.  ahchoo.  sorry.  ohh.   aah.  raster. raster.  you try carrying a 100pound dog.  that's 700 in human pounds.   back off, frozen fiend.     we still dot know.  either nicolai or the super fans could be behind this.  velma: or galina.  undercover work has its hazards.  guys, i've got another plan.  oh, joy.  let's set a trap for the frozen fiend.  what.  but we never do that until i solve the mystery.  i know, but i've been thinking.  putting together clues and sleuthing is all well and good, but wouldn't it be easier if we captured the monster right up front.  then we take off his mask and just see who it is.  it's brilliant, freddy, except for one flaw.  like, what if the monster is really a monster.  exactly.  but we won't know that until we try to unmask him.  sure.  i've always felt finding clues got in the way of our solving cases.  i knew you guys would get it.  ok, so this is the trap i've thought up.  it's code named operation: extreme twist.  announcer: sweden is on it's way to victory over finland in this third place matchup.    sweden.  how swede it is.  a line change now for finland.  they're subbing in what looks to be their rarely played reserves.  one player is scared of the ice.  this is a national embarrassment for finland.  scoob, you're blowing our cover.  we have to go play so we can lure the frozen fiend out onto the ice.  uhh. roh.  finland is playing a man short by choice.  guys, we just need to keep playing until the frozen fiend shows up.  uhh.  sorry.  hey, i'm playing.  i've dreamed of this my whole life.  i'm playing professional hockey.  whoa. ooh.  that was charging and crosschecking and not very nice.     commence extreme twist now.  aah.  whoohoo.  bowwow. rall right.  freddy, it worked.  now we just have to unmask this beast.  daphne: he's trying to spin himself free.  i anticipated that.  even if he succeeds, he'll collapse from dizziness.  watch. i'll tip him over.  whoa. uhh.  all: freddy.    all: whoa.   all: whoa.  so much for me and my big trap.  perhaps we should return to our proven methods of crimesolving.   that's a highstick penalty, mister.    hey, hey, hey, hey    i need a seeker like you on my side    i'll search forever to nab you    i won't give up, i'll go out of my mind   we've got him surrounded.   i'll search forever to find you     he got away.  how could that gigantic fiend escape through that tiny window.  who cares.  we just found this.  the trophy. great. case closed.  i'll be at the concession area.  daphne: but all the diamonds are missing.  more work. great.  i'll need food for energy.  what is this.  arrest brett hull.  brett. something's wrong here.  brett's not the fiend.  scooby and i were saved by brett when we were attacked on the lake.  that means someone is framing him, but who.  so, it was brett who was full of the badness.  it is sad his team, now without him, has no chance for championships.  ha ha ha.  hmm.  i didn't know nicolai was in here.  i say we follow him.  galina's still here, too.  well, maybe it's galina we should talk with, not nicolai.  roh.  no clues here.    all: aah.      guys, i think i've solved the mystery.  it's trapsetting time.  announcer: it's a tightfought battle, folks.  hockey team is definitely struggling without their captain, brett hull.  first, we lure the fiend to center ice.  then daphne and i swoop down from the ceiling on long trapezes and spray the monster with water tanks.  when he freezes, we capture him.  i got scoob in the tights, but he says no way to going on the ice.  i don't rike tights.  these scooby snax say otherwise.  russian scooby snax, beet flavored.  beets.  got a few more out there, scoob.  there's no beating beets.      i have concluded brett hull cannot be the frozen fiend.  he is free to go.  .  stand back.   galina.  as i suspected.  but why.  i did it because i wanted the priceless diamonds in the cup.  and i would have gotten away with it if it wasn't for you meddling, foreign kids.  but, like, where are the diamonds.  galina stole them, but then couldn't get them out of the rink because they were searching everyone who was coming and going.  so, she hid the diamonds here in the ice.  fred: that's what was hard enough to stop the zamboni.  velma: she had a special dress made with fake diamonds, then was going to switch one for the other and walk out wearing the real diamonds.  but how could she skate on pavement.  and appear twice as tall.  she used inline skates outdoors, and because of her trickskating abilities, she can skate while wearing stilts.  but what about the light blue paint of the super fans.  turns out that super fan joe is really a big fan of the light blue swedish team.  he used that paint to secretly cheer for them.  you are obviously too smart for me.  ..  again.  hey, we could all use something to eat.  wait. i just thought of something.  galina may have already made the switch.  she's wearing the diamonds now.  good thing there was someone to replace the injured u.s. goalie.  now, this rocks.   ray. roohoo.  scoobydoobydoo.  i'm still cold.  captioning m  rrrr.      aaahaaah.  rarr arrr.   rarrr raaarr.     we're coming after you    we're gonna solve that mystery  )
