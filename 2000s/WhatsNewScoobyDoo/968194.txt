 action.   totally.  swells must have been 10 feet high.   you two say you're surfers, but nobody ever sees you in the surf.   we better tell them, sean.   see, dudes, you might find this hard to believe, but we're upsidedown surfers.  you're what.   it's our invention.   yeah.   see, you bind your feet underneath the board, and breathe through this special snorkel.   it's totally like being part of the wave.   gives new meaning to the "  under the curls was really tubular tonight, but then we saw this big coral skeleton thing and we knew we had to get out.   yeah.  we might have caught one wave too many.    look.  shaggy and scooby's blips are ..  out to sea.  somehow they're right under the great barrier reef.   huh.  scoobydoo, you're a sand drip monster.   so are you.   hey, guys, like, where are we.  looks like nobody can talk but you and me.  good thing we have these scooby snacks, or i'd be really scared right now.  the gang should find us soon, hopefully before the snacks run out.  whatever's going on here, let's just play along, scoob.   ok.   according to the screen, they're directly below us.   velma, are you sure you want to dive.   for shaggy and scooby, yes.  and to actually see the great barrier reef.     we're in some sort of tunnel.   and we're not alone.   the sand drip sand builders.   and there's rama yam.   shaggy and scoobythey're sand drip monsters.   like, don't mind us, o, outsiders.  we are humble zombieized workers who are, by the way, out of snacks.   they're fine.   but how do we get them out.   not to mention us.   a challenge with a simple solution.  a plan using only objects found in this tunnel.  it seems like it could use just one more thing.   how about this.    a challenge with an even simpler solutionrun.   the tunnel's collapsing.   turn around.  toward the beach.   no.  scooby.  scooby, watch out.  swim, buddy.  it saved scooby.  when she'll cry when her boyfriend doesn't call.  she'll cry when you don't let her borrow the car.  but now is one time she won't shed a single tear.  as gentle to the eyes as pure water.  johnson's no more tears baby shampoo.  88888 8qqqqqq i wish my birthday were every

badness, and i think i know just who it is.   it's getting away.   the real monster isn't going anywhere.   that's rama yam.   actually, spencer johnson.   i realized he was faking that trance when he started yelling commands to his muddy minions.  and this is how he got them that way.  ..   ahem.   so why would you do such awful things to those nice kids.   they were working for the greater good of mankind, building the reefway.   like, i've never heard of a reefway.   it would have been the 9th wonder of the world, an underwater highway for cars, buses, trains, anything that rolls, connecting australia to new guinea.   ingenious.  insane, but ingenious.  so when you couldn't do that legally, you lured the best teenage builders here with that sand castle contest.   you dragged us down through the wet sand and made us all look like sand drip monsters.   then you hypnotized them and put them to work.   that's what snapped us out of the trance.  guess we were saved by the snacks.  ha ha.   he faked his disappearance so he could supervise his laborers.  he made them dig out rocks from the ocean floor and pile them at night on the beach.  well, i would have gotten away with it if it weren't for you meddling sand drips.   but what about that coral creature.   that's all it iscoral.   you mean for once the monster's real.   it's no monster.  lots of strange creatures have evolved under the great barrier reef.  the sounds of the undersea building probably confused it and drove it out of the deep.   well, now that tunnel's shut down forever.  it won't be bothered anymore.   thank you, coral creature.   hey, we want to welcome the sand builders back and to thank you for letting us play some mellow sounds guaranteed not to crack your castles.   let's start with liberty's broken heart and n.y.c.  could never be torn apart it could be one world, not three ah ah oh    congratulations, frankie.  like, nothing could top your sand villa.  except maybe the 6foot fudge ice cream cone sculpture with sand drip sprinkles that scoob and i just made.  now where is it.   scoobydoobydoo...ptooey. garfield:       ..  i know how much you supermodels love cartoonists, but i'm promised to another.   ahem.  yoo hoo. hello.  time to get up.  very important day.  wakeywakey.  oooh, i hate to do this.  no, i don't.       why did you do that.  you did that because it's trash night.   it's some sort of holiday.  ..  oh no.  that's today.  i'm sorry, i'm sorry, i'm sorry.   he's sorry, he's sorry, he's sorry.   i'll have them in a jif.   all right, garfield.  your birthday lasagnas are ready.     oh, this is great, garfield.  i'm going to edit this into my lasagna home video montage.     eh.  i've been shortchanged.   there, i've added the new footage.  i have over six hours of video of garfield eating lasagna.   huh.   well, it's not like he does anything else.    complaint.   something wrong, garfield.   recount demand.   what is it.  i cooked you one lasagna for every year old you are.    i'm one short.  i'm one short.  and i don't have the ingredients to make another birthday lasagna.  uh, i'm going to the market.  i'll be right back.   while he's gone, i'm gonna put the time to good use.  i'm gonna do something constructive.      twentyfour zordniks until we reach the invasion planet, exalted leader.   good.  did you send for reekotta.   here he is, exalted leader.   reekotta.  i have a mission of vital importance for you.   am i to lead the attack on the invasion planet, exalted leader.   no, this is more important.  let me show you.  our scanners have taken thousands of images of the invasion planet and we see nothing that can possibly prevent us from invading and ..  ..   who are those people.   we do not know.  apparently, they are from a planet that is neighbor to ours.  they obviously travelled to the planet we intend to invade.   what happened to them.   the spy images do not show that.  we need to know what we are facing.   i believe i know that person.  i could be wrong but i think that is my uncle mozzi.   go ahead to the invasion planet.  go to where that orange creature is and find out what happened to those people.  take this.  it will measure the brain power of those you encounter.   right away, exalted leader.  this is reekotta.  i am on my way to scout the invasion planet.  i will report back.  agent reekotta reporting.  i am on the invasion planet as ordered.  i will     measuring brain power of a local creature i encountered.  ..  zero.     i will seek out the orange creature.     have located the orange creature.  it appears to be in state of deep suspended animation.   sounds like arbuckle's back.    it's coming.  i must hide.   hope he has my last lasagna ready.  aaahh, there it is.   please do not eat me.   wh.  eh, did you hear something.   hiyah. hiyah.  hiii yah.    ouch.  ..  ..that is...  what was that.   whoa.   oof.  odie, did you see my lasagna run past this way.   unhunh.   well, it did.  my lasagna had legs and it ran and it talked, and then, ..  and it had, like, a mouth, and it was talking and it went like it ran.  you believe me, don't you, odie.   unhunh.   well, that's okay.  i don't believe me, either.     leader: you are satisfied that the orange creature.  will be no threat.   i am.  i do not know what he did to vanquish the people in those images but i know i was able to handle him.   hmmm.   then the invasion shall commence.  ..  and i didn't know lasagna could talk.  why didn't it say something.  what if it isn't just lasagna.  what if ravioli can talk.  what if the cannoli tries to beat me up.  and the garlic bread.  i'll starve.       hold on, boy.  i can't understand you.  please note.  odie is less articulate than baked lasagna.  what is it.  something out there.      odie.  they're coming for me.     i've gotta hide.  ]  that creature.  seize him.    ]  if i had an ounce of courage, i'd go out there and save my friend odie.  good thing for me i don't have an ounce of courage.   fine work, reekotta.  now, we just need to neutralize that orange creature.  you say he will be easy to defeat.   very easy, exalted leader.  just as soon as we finm.  he is here somewhere.    we will find that orange creature and we will destroy him.   what did i ever do to lasagna.  besides eat thousands of them.   there is no sign of the orange creature in here.  let us check all the closets.   aaarrgh.   did you notice something.     reekotta, i heard.  is something wrong.  agggghhhh.   this is silly.  i can't just hide in here for the rest of my life.  yes, i can.  no, i can't.  jon.  odie.  talking lasagna.     odie.  it's me they want.  might as well get it over with.     the humanity.   sounds like they're in jon's room.   i thought you said it would be easy to defeat, reekotta.   i thought it would be.   guys, it's time to end this.    run away. run away.     wow.  ..  but i'm sure glad they're gone.     yeah, but you never know what happened.  they were dangerous and scary ..  but boy did they shall look delicious.   garfield. i'm back.  i knew you wouldn't want to wait until i cooked it so i stopped off at vito's and got you that extra birthday lasagna.   no, no.  take it away.  it might talk to me.  .. it might...  aaaahhhh.   gee.  i always thought vito was a pretty good cook.                  ah.  mmmm.  mmmmwah.  huh. hoo.  ahhh... )
