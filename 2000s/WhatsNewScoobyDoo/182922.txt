 introducingaveeno ultracalming with active nat.   chchchchocolate     but i'm right in the middle of a piano lesson.  why don't you wait in there.  um, ok.    keep playing, doll.  the keyboard's just a little out of tune, that's all.   the mystery kids.  whatever happened to that band.  they sure were popular.  and they're going to be again.  you must be the mystery kids' biggest fan, susan.  i'm their mother, and i'm a very busy woman.  this interview can't take too long.  um, we're not reporters.  we're actually here about our van, the mystery machine.  you own the mystery machine.  well, that used to be our tour bus when we were first starting out.  since they were the mystery kids,  what are you kids doing.  tennis tryouts are next week.  hello. i'm looking for my prom dress.  we've got an album to finish and a concert at city park tomorrow night.  oh, mom. oh, mom.  don't you give me that lip.  now sit up straight. we have guests.  andy and mandy, meet the new owners of the mystery machine.  wow, i thought mom sold it for scrap parts.  is that thing still running.  yeah, except now, it's running on ghost power.  shaggy likes to exaggerate.  let's just say some strange things have been happening that we can't yet explain.  is there anything you can tell us about the mystery machine that might help.  well, technically, the van was owned by our keyboard player, flash flannigan.  fred: do you think we could talk to flash.  not unless you've got a ouija board.  andrew.  flash well, flash had an accident after one of the concerts.  and now he's in rock 'n' roll heaven.   rock 'n' roll heaven.  that could be a song. write it down.  like, now i know what's wrong with the mystery machine.  the ghost of flash flannigan is haunting it.  reah.  it was like his home away from home.  he even painted it to remind him of the flowers in his garden.  so flash flannigan painted the mystery machine.  i thought the flower pattern was your idea, fred.  nope. i always wanted to paint it red.  why don't you watch where you're going.  who are you.  i'm randy.  randy dimwiddie.  ah. andy and mandy's brother.  all: oh.  a flight engineering: sixth edition.  this is a great book. where do you study.  at defries technical academy, and now you've made me late for class.  susan didn't even mention that andy and mandy have a brother.  shaggy: like, we've got to find some alternate means of transport.  this walking is for the birds.  reah. oh.   oh.   all: aah. aah. aah.  oh.  gotta think fast.  the whole box, scooby, all for you.  now go get it.   aah.  ..   we told you so.   jeepers.  the mystery machine really is haunted.  the way i see it, there's only one way to solve this mystery.  follow that van.  darn. looks like we lost it.  velma: defries technical academy.  hey, that's the school randy dimwiddie attends.  i wonder if he's here.  then we lost its trail right around here.  any idea why it would come to this school, randy.  how should i know.  i never had anything to do with the mystery kids.  i'm just their tonedeaf brother.  i don't count.  these robotic appendages are quite remarkable, but where are the control panels.  with wireless internet technology, i could make the robots execute a complex sequence of commands from right here.   great work. your mother must be very proud.  oh, yeah, right.  she pretends to take an interest, helps me with my homework or whatever, but it's just a show.  i'll never make the charts like her precious mystery kids.  you're a smart guy, randy.  what would you do if your van started driving itself all over town.  i'd find myself a good mechanic.  fred: murph.  yo, murph, you here.  it wasn't until we got the mystery machine back from murph that it started acting funny.   if you think this is funny, i'd hate to see what your idea of hilarious is.  and why did he try and buy it from us when we were at the garage.  that's obvious. because it's a sweet ride.  both: mmhmm.  daphne: jeepers. velma: jenkies.   wow.  murph is a secret mystery kids fan.  looks like he cornered the mystery kids collectibles market.  look at this stuff.  mmm.  hey, check it out.   that's handy.  announcer:..  rise and fall of the mystery kids.  it was there at the infamous city park concert that flash flannigan stormed offstage and vanished into rock 'n' roll legend.  but behind, he left one final mystery.  each week, a wild daisy appears on flash's headstonethe gift of an obsessed fan or a calling card from flash himself.  sounds like strange things are happening at flash flannigan's grave.  let's check it out.  but how are we going to get there.  we're almost to flash flannigan's grave now.  hold up. someone's there.  velma: andy and mandy.  but what are they doing here.  come on, gang. let's follow 'em.   i don't suppose that could be some other van that plays mystery kids hits, scooby.  all: aah.   i close my eyes    i try to sleep, i can't forget you    dada da, dada da    and i'd do anything for you    dada da, dada da    oh    i'd do anything    just to hold you in my arms   ..     i'd do anything    just to hold you in my arms   ..     i'd do anything   aah.   the mystery machine's got shaggy.  .. .  . and your flavor needs come on strong .  . get your shake on .  . mmmm, danimals .  . you got the fingers .  . you got the moves .  . hey, even dylan can't get it wrong .  . get your crush on, mmm .  . danimals, we're in step .  . we're on a roll .  . dude, stop singing .  . this silly song .  . get your slurp on, mmm .  . danimals, dude .  it's danimalious.  danimals. get your blast on.  ght, sweetie.  but i love chef.       what do you wantfor dinner.  chef boyardee.  boy, this stuff is good.  here goes.  be careful, freddy.  unh.  i'm comin', shag. hang in there.  whoa. whoa.  aah. great.   whoa. aah. unh.  zoinks.   whoa. hoohoohoohoo.  fred: shaggy.  yeow. unh.     yes.  what's goin' on, buddy.  where'd you get your license, clown school.  we weren't driving, officer.  come on, fellas.  that van can't drive itself.  you can believe him, officer.  the van has been acting weird all week.  well, looks like no one got hurt.  we'll call it a malfunction and let you guys off with a warning.  but we'll have to impound your vehicle.  you might consider keeping it in solitary.  mmhmm.   pick up the pace, kids.  it's not a lullaby, and i'm snoozing.  like, we didn't think we'd see you here tonight.  my mom told me that if i didn't set up a wireless controlled lighting display for the show, she's stop paying my tuition.  excuse me. there's a rehearsal going on here.  authorized personnel only.  murph.  oh. heh heh. hey.  we know why you're here, murph.  well, yeah, lookin' for you.  so all i've gotta say is 2,500 plus impound and towing fees.  take it or leave it.  and we know why you want it.  we happened to see your shrine.  what. you saw it.  we sure did.  ok, i admit it.  i've been into them for years.  it's not somethin' i'm proud of.  promise you won't tell anybody cool.   what the heck happened, randy.  i don't know. i wasn't even near that light.  i am so sure.  mom, randy's trying to wreck our show.  there could have been a fire.  no way, mandy. that's a fireproof curtain.  it's lined with lead.  i said, i didn't do it.  well, if randy didn't, then who did.  maybe it was the ghost of flash flannigan.  i doubt that very highly, but that gives me an idea.  why don't we let flash himself clear up this mystery.  how.  daphne's going to hold a seance.  like, what's a seance, and is it catered.   a seance is where you contact spirits  ggggggrave.   huh.   aah.  now we're going to find out who's really haunting the mystery machine.  thank you all for coming.  we are gathered tonight to contact the spirit of flash flannigan.  i am the great madame daphne.  where did you learn to contact spirits.  an infomercial on the psychic channel.  watch this.  spirits, make this table rise.  thank you, spirits.  scoobydoo: you're welcome.  the spirit of flash flannigan is near.   where.  shaggy: like, i'm deep in the ground.  but i'm also in the air, and maybe even in the cosmos.  flash, we need your help.  tell us who has corrupted the mystery machine.  was it andy or mandy to hype the mystery kids, randy, to get revenge on his ungrateful siblings, murph, to get us to sell.  teryids music playing]   like, everybody run.   yeow. aah.  aah.  guys.  help.  rrelp.      it stopped. how come.  because that leadlined curtain is keeping wireless commands from getting through to its computers.  and my guess is the person sending those commands is sitting right at this table.  daphne, velma, and shaggy:.  mom. mom. mom.  susan wanted the mystery kids to be back on top of the music world.  so she came up with this publicity stunt to get attention for their concert.  she helped randy with his homework.  so she could learn to control the mystery machine with wireless commands.  when the mystery machine was at murph's for repairs, susan planted a webcam and receiver in the dashboard.  that meant she could control the mystery machine from anywhere.  scooby, why don't you show us how it's done.  ok.    it's that ghoulie greenish glow.  relax, shaggy.  they're just green colored christmas tree lights hooked into the battery.  but andy and mandy, why were you hanging out at flash flannigan's grave.  flash was our hero, and with our upcoming comeback, we missed hi visiting the grave.  but my favorite clue is that sour note that came from the van.  it's the same out of tune sound that came from susan dimwiddie's keyboard.  that means she must have recorded that eerie score, and not flash flannigan.  well, i never meant for the band to get so out of control, but you kids wouldn't stop meddling.  it doesn't matter, though.  the mystery kids are still gonna be bigger than ever.  andy: sorry, mom, but the mystery kids are calling it quits.  .  if being famous again means having to go through all this, we're, like, totally happy being hasbeens.  sorry we were so hard on you, randy.  from now on, all of us kids are so sticking together.  it's nice havin' the good old mystery machine back on our side.  $8,000, and that's my final offer.  fred, daphne, velma, and shaggy: it's not for sale, murph.  no way.  murph: i wonder if they still want those instruments.  shaggy: like, great way to celebrate gettin' our mystery machine back by taking it to the movies.   zoinks. the mystery machine is alive.  all: aah.   scoobydoobydoo.    krypto     krypto     the
