remembered something.  the professor's watch.  professor.  over intercom: professor.  uuhhuh. velma.  velma, what are you kids doing.  there's no time to explain.  the house has malfunctioned, and

central computer.  i don't think it likes that.  hurry up, velma.  got it.  thanks, guys.  thanks.  well, now that we're all together again, it's time to get out of this hightech house of horror.  only one problem with your plan, freddy.  yeah, what's that.  him.   ..cut. that was amazing.  the only way it could have been better is if ihoratio hidalgohad done it myself.  like, man, you have got to be kidding.  we were almost goners.  oh, yes. i mean it was terrible. justterrible.  mind signing these release forms.  this guy sure would do anything to get footage for his tv show.  velma: he's welding the door shut.  now we'll never get out of this crazy place.  i'm not so sure about that, shaggy.  in fact, i think i have this mystery just about figured out.  the only thing left to do is capture that robot.  scoob and i are not gonna be bait just for a few scooby snax.  these aren't just scooby snax.  they're new and improved scooby snax.  oh, man.  they added shredded jalapeno cheddar and those tiny colored marshmallows.   yoohoo    robot    yoohoo    .  well, i guess that makes the only suspect professor ostwald.  if it wasn't horatio or the blather brothers inside the suit, then it had to be the only person who could control jeeves with a computer.  but the link between his watch and his house went dead when we tried to contact him.  he couldn't have been controlling things inside the house even if he wanted to.  but, like, who else could have done this.  not who, shaggy, but what.  the culprit is the house itself.  .   shari: you're right. idid it.  i trapped the tourists.  i had jeeves rewire the panel.  i'm the one who kept you all here.  why.  because laslow ostwald took credit for everything.  i am the one who deserves the attention.  .and that's just what i'm going to get, even in spite of you meddling kids.   yeow.  ..yow.  we're trapped. what are we going to do.  nothing. just sit on the ground and do nothing.  all: what.  trust me.  shari: pay attention to me.  pay attention to me.   pay attention to me.  pay attention to me.  ..attention...  daphne: it worked.  but how did you know.  because all along, the house wanted one thing: attention.  that's why it scared people.  that's why it trapped us.  and once we refused to give it what it wanted most, it couldn't take it.  shari overloaded.  and cut.  mind signing these release forms.   genetically engineered horseradish.  i dare you to eat the whole thing.  mind if i borrow this.  wow. you win the dare.  what dare.   like, it's another rogue robot.  scoobydoobydoo.
