electric lights until 1902.  laura lasswell, professional western authenticator, and i am here to tell you that nothing western around here is very authentic.  but it's all in fun for our fantasies.  well, my fantasy is to find one thing in this place that actually happened.  otherwise, it's just another western myth and should be shut down.  do you think they actually had little ponies on their boots.  they'd have been laughed right out of the saloon.  if they had saloons.  i wonder if there are any other fun guests at this hotel.  man: hello, velma.  gibby norton.  what are you doing here.  i came for a little excitement.  looks like i hit the jackpot.  don't bet on it.  ha ha ha. always so clever.  well, save a hoedown for me.  they didn't have hoedowns.  hmm.  you only say that when there's something suspicious going on.  whenever gibby norton's around, there's something suspicious going on.  well, uh, partners, let's get trottin' to our wild west fantasies.  you mean it gets better than this.  yippyyiaaaaah.  whoa. aaaaah.  rhoa. hee hee. rhoa.  hoohoohoo.   came from alabama with a banjo on my knee    and i'm going to california    my true love for to see    oh, susanna,

 yeehaw.  they never said "yeehaw".   this madness has to stop.  .  ohh. what.   jeepers.  what's going on.  looks like some galoot didn't pay this here month's electric bill.   these cowpokes don't seem to take to water.  yup, it's suddenly a ghost town around these here parts.  if robots can have ghosts.  freg, who seems to have conveniently disappeared.  well, partners, looks like we got another mystery on our cow hands.  what's that.  i think i see a light coming from up the street.  let's check it out.  do you smell flapjacks, scoob.  uhuh.  and if anyone knows how to smell flapjacks, it's us.  uhhuh.  so, either chuckwagon chuck has chucked his wagon or we're lost.   zoinks.  a robot graveyard.  we're very, very lost.  rikes.   aah.  aah.  escaped .  to the batcave .  .

the heck is going on here.  this is the control room for all of cyber gulch.  cool, huh.  i guess i was foolin' around with this stuff, l the lights went out.  why were you fooling around.  the scientific mind is ever curious.  i got everything goin' but the lights.   here they come again.  dang.  gibby, stop it.  hey. what.  now where was it that scientist said we should never ever go.  oh, yeah. that's it.  both: aiee.  both: aah.  the only thing worse than seeing crashed robots is seeing live crashed robots.  both: aah. aah.  both: whoa.  shaggy: unh.    who knows what harm you've done, gibby.  we've gotta shut down this control panel.  it's no use. i tried everything.  there's no way to stop it.  whoever did that is a scientific genius.  thank you.  now gibby, tell us what you were trying to do here.  that's for me to know and you to find out.  bye, velma.  daphne: look at this.  it's really weird.    freg, the scientist who runs this place.  velma: he seems to be working on a way cate himself.  creepy. is he mad.  he looks pretty happy in the drawing.  what are you kids doing in my lab.  on second thought, i'll go with mad.  we were just trying to find out why the lights all went out.  well, you don't belong in here.  before we leave as paying guests at this not so inexpensive resort, i think you owe us some sort of explanation.  i don't owe you anything.  but i suppose it's only right that you be warned.  warned.  some of my manimatrons a robot called cold steel and his band of desperados have gotten out of my control.  they turned unthinkably evil.  ah. i'll have to close down cyber gulch.  you can't do that.  hey, we'll help you find out what's goin' on.  i thought i'd deactivated them.  but suddenly, they're up and running again, hungry for fresh energy, drained out of living humans.  shaggy and scoobywe've got to find them right now.  all the robot cowboys seem to be gone.  well, maybe they're just on a break.  shaggy: help.  scoobydoo: relp.  shaggy and scooby are in that jailhouse.  our heroes.  what happened.  scary, creepy cowboy robots stuck us in here.  like, at sunrise, something horrible is gonna happen to our brains.  not if we cannh.  i'll look around for a cake with a file inside.  ..  tweezers and a stale taffy bar.  and you're out.  you should patent those things.  shaggy: that's them.  the mechanical maniacs.    hold it. stop what you're doing now.  they're your robots. please stop them.  they're not responding.  they can no longer be controlled.  my creations are rebelling.   no. oh, no.  youyou can't turn on your own creator.  you can't have my brain.  what are they going to do.  anythi they want.  well, hang on there, pilgrims.  that' no way to treat stranger folks.  come on. time to get the heck out of gulch.   hyah. hyah.  whoop. whoa.  what do you think is behind those malicious marauders.  it could still be the scientist.  he's just nuts enough.  how about that cow hugging historian.  or sneaky little gibby norton.  i'd love it to be him.  those lowdown polecats are on our trail.  do you think these horses know the way to alaska.  they'd be rode too hard.  we'll catch the train to sedona, get help from real live people, and come back to solve this mystery.   i got the feelin' i'm on a long lonely highway      yes, you do, and i just can't pretend    cause i'm by myself, and i'm at my wit's end and i    haven't seen myself in a while    haven't been myself in a while    haven't seen myself in a while    haven't been myself in a while     yeah    oh, yeah   it's new marshmallow pebbles.  no leading cereal has more marshmallows to rock your whole mouth.  the marshmallowest part of a complete breakfast.   oh, yeah   ] anyone's fail.  introd shield antiperspirant.  it targets and neutralizes odorat the source.  help eliminate odor,don't just cover it up.  . .  shaggy: like, at least those robot rough guys didn't follow us into the river.  i believe i'm close to solving the mystery of cyber gulch.  fred: be very quiet.  the rocks up there don't look too steady.  we haven't seen those demented droid desperados in over an hour.  do ya think we've left them behind.  i hope, i hope, i hope.  me, too, me, too, me, too.  they're definitely not behind.   yieee.  all: aah.  like, that's what i call a rock concert.   fred, quick. plan, run, what.  heeyah.  wow. freddy.  yeah. learned that at the elvis camp.  of course, the king did it while holding a guitar.   daphne: sheriff lawman.  how did you find us.  been tailin' cold steel and his men.  finally paid off.  well, you can relax, sheriff.  we vamoosed those psychotic cyborgs.  y'all have to come with me back to cyber gulch.  like, why.  it's my sworn duty to protect the town.  you came there and destroyed the peace .. you're wanted, dead or alive.  well, in that case, i vote for alive.   what do you have against us.  well, little missy, since you were caught at the ranch house laboratory, it's gotta be you folks who reactivated those vicious varmints.  that's a crime in cyber gulch.  we're innoce.  frontier justice will decide that.  out here, it's short and swift.    it's a western cliche, and so is kangaroo court justice.  release them at once.  no can do, ma'am.  they need to be locked up.  they caused a lot of trouble hereabouts.  but we didn't.  don't worry, velma.  i'll wait for you till you get out.  eat water, sheriff.  oh. aah.  yeowohh.    aha.  dr. freg is a robot.  apparrently so.  it became obvious that water shorts the cybernetic circuits.  so if freg's not human, then who built the robots.  sheriff lawman didn't spark.  he's very human.  freg and every manimatron in town.  and you didn't do it just so people could have a vacation weekend.  i reckon not, little missy.  years ago, i was a skinny kidmyron scrim, the class computer nerd that everyone always picked on.  well, i had to do somethin' about it.  so one day, my inventions allowed that i could create cyber gulch resort.  and spend the rest of my life savin' people every day, bein' thethe town hero.  well, who created those bad guys.  i'm afraid i did that, too.  made cold steel and his men tough and challenging to make my rescues necessary.  i guess i did too good a job.  they got out of control.  i shut 'em down after the last attack on some tourists, and they never would have been reactivated if you kids hadn't been meddling around my ranch house lab.  i wasn't meddling there.  me, neither.  were you meddling.  not me.  not me.  for once, none of us were meddling.  well, somebody was.  velma: gibby.  so you were in that lab trying to find the secrets of the animatronics here. why.  velma, fred, daphne, shaggy and scoobydoo: a gibbyland theme park.  he was trying to impress velma.  gibby, i wouldn't be impressed even if you came up with a robotic me.  heyhey.  don't get any ideas.  well, buckaroos, sorry your fantasies got a little bushwhacked 'cause of mine.  good luck with cyber gulch, sheriff.  " yes, the world can always use one more hero.  ha ha ha. well, i'm much obliged to you kids.  in fact, i'd like to leave scooby here with a little somethin' i whipped together.  scoobydoobydoobydoobydoobydoobydoo.   oh, that's so cute.  hee hee hee hee hee.  ..  courage the cowardly dogshow, starring courage the cowardly dog.  aah.  abandoned as a pup, he was found by muriel, who lives in the middle of nowhere, with her husbandeustace bag.  yah.  but creepy stuff happens in nowhere.  it's up to courage to save his new home.  stupid dog, you made me look bad.  oogaboogabooga.  captioning made possible byturner entertainment department of education tv: aah.   )
