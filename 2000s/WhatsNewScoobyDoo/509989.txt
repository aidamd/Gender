appears ernest and penelope are gone.  has anyone seen them.  meister, and let me tell ya, he's very protective of that recipe.  i also found this mask.  you won't believe who it belongs to.  trudy was wearing it.  the girl from the gift shop.  she seems to be sneaking around the factory.  so maybe she's behind all of this.  what do you think, velmvelma.  hmm.  2 hazardous material suits are missing.  want to bet our monster is using one f penelope: aah.  oh, thank goodness you're here.  what happened.  my father was sleepwalking again, so i went looking for him, but the monster jumped
