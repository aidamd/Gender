running out of soldiers.  ..     right, scoob.  like, we have to find the puppies before the gold monster does.   we'll start back at the barracks and look for clues.   well, i think i found a clue.   huh.  like, they weren't there earlier.   look, gang.  dirt on their paws.  i wonder what that means.    well, i guess fort knox is open for business.   drill sergeant payne had a security badge for a secret devievelopment lab.  i think we should check out that lab.   right.  and while we do that, shaggy, you and scooby take the pups into town and check out that local loony travis knox.   good idea, fred.  then we can also hit the goldade factory and search for suspicious soft drinks.   yumahem.  yeah.   will you sign this petition to give fort knox back to its rightful owner.   are you travis knox.   yep.  just like the fort.   sure.  we'll sign.  like, is the gold yours, too.   gold.   yeah, like there's a gigantic pile of gold in there.   are you kidding me.  first they take my land, .  i love gold.  and i love my land.  oh, they've gone too far.  .   those smoothies sure look good.   that'll be $27, please.   what are you doing in the secret development lab.   trying to solve the gold monster mystery.  we might ask you the same question.   i am the general in charge of everything and authorized to be anywhere.   good answer.   hey, these fit nicely.  what do they dooh.  wow.  i can see our barracks from up here.   what's this, general.   don't touch that.  it's our most topsecret device: shutdown goo.  it's an expandable net that traps anything it covers.   shutdown goo.  ..  ..   do you have any "help fred down" goo.   boy, do i love goldade.  then again, everyone does.    well, hello, strangers.  i'm sue crose, owner of goldade soft drinks and cleaner of broken glass.  can i help you.   like, we're just here to drink as much goldade as humanly and doggedly possible.   well, you're in luck.  looks like i got two left.   like, can i just say that i love goldade.   well, sugar, if that crazy army doesn't knock it off with those explosion exercises, there won't be any more goldade for you to love.  every hourboom.  uhoh.  hold on.   what for.   noontime exercises.  oh.  these are doozies.    how long does this last.   sorry.  we don't sell gas.   like, where are the pups.    if they don't stop those every hour boom booms, i will have to shut down goldade.  but that general won't talk to me.  and i have tried everythingphone calls, email, smoke signals.   miss crose, we'd like to help you clean up this mess using our very special technique.   and what's that, hon.    fred, i don't think you should have walked out with those heat vision goggles.   oh, i think i should have.  look.   i don't see anything.   but i canwith these goggles.  puppy paw prints.  and they lead to the gold room.   they also lead to the gold monster.   aah.   aah.   man, this makes the army life like not so bad.   shaggy, scooby, run.   i wonder what they're running from.     zoinks.  like i had to ask.   aah.     looks like we finally found the mess hall.   and so did he.  ..ah...     no.   zoinks.  ..  is gold.   poor puppy.   we've got to save 14karat, and fast.      what's going on.    just what in the name of the 82nd airborne are you doin', ma'am.   i had no other choice, general.et with me.  you won't talk to me.  your silly army explosions are gonna put goldade outta business.   fine.  ..  in army jail.  to the stockade.   huh.  looks like the goldade lady has a problem with the general.  like, we've got our own problem: 14karat is gold.   we can help him.  first we have to find the gold monster.   we'll save ya, 14karat.  don't move.   the monster seems to be coming from this room.   since there's no other way out, this time, we'll stay together and look for clues.   looks like there is another way out.  good work, secret sifive.  it seems like someone's managed to break into fort knox.   but the gold's still here.   hmm.  maybe we'll find out why at the end of this tunnel.    like, can we just find the end that gets us outta here.   is everybody all right.   like, we're ok.   shaggy, go back to the gold room.  there were some maps in the corner.  maybe you can figure a way to get us out of here.   roger that.  pups, let's move out.   hup, hup, hup, hah, hup, hup, hup.   ok, pups.  ..  and that is to figure out what all these lines are.   raggy.   good work, scoob.  these air vents lead right to fred, daphne, and velma.  but we're too big to go through.  wait.  i have an idea.  go get 'em.   this doesn't make sense.  if someone was trying to break into fort knox, this tunnel should lead to the beginning, but it stops right here.   maybe the collapse sealed it off.   nice landing, jingle.   thank you, blingbling.  now let's start digging.   uh, velma, i think you're digging ng direction.   if my suspicions are ..   the goldade factory.   hi, guys.  whew.  that's a lotta dirt.   i think i've just solved the mystery.  no one was trying to break into fort knox.  someone was trying to break out of fort knox.   sounds like it's time to set a trap.   we'll need two good menshaggy, scooby, you've just been drafted.   even with our lily livers and no backbones.   luckily, there's a curescooby snax.   ah.   attention, private gold man.  because of a breach in security, you need a new access cardlike this.  about face.  aat ease.  halt.  like, retreat.  like, retreat.    to go back to where i was would just be wrong i'm pressin' on i'm pressin' on oh, my distress is going, going, gone pressin' on pressin' on and i won't sit back and take this anymore 'cause i'm done with that i've got one foot out the door and to go back to where i was would just be wrong i'm pressin' on    lks.  we're ready to switch our car insurance to progressive.  today just seemed like a great day to save.  oh, it's not just today.  with our free loyalty program, you earn great stuff like accident forgiveness and bigger discounts just by staying with us.  oh.  ooh.  so, what you're saying is, it gets even better with age.  oh.  tell me we're still talking about insurance.  rewarding loyalty.  now,that'sprogressive.  call or click today.  let's go for the gold.  now.     now we'll find out what kind of person trains nice little puppies to do their nasty dirty work.   let's see who wanted to break out of fort knox.  .   but, like, why.   this army man wanted to be a businessman and take over goldade.  by causing explosions every hour, he could drive sue crose away.  then all he needed were the secret ingredients, and he'd be the solidgold soft drink king.   and i would have gotten out of fort knox, too, if it weren't for you meddling civilians, sirs and ma'ams.   he trained the secret 6 to stay up at night and dig that tunnel.   that explains the dirt on their paws, but why the ugly gold plasma suit.   so he could blend into the gold.  because with security this tight, the best place to hide is in plain sight.    right.  14karat is still gold.   he's fine, sir.  it's a gold variation of the shutdown goo, sir.  it peels right off, sir.     well, we gotta hand it to the secret 6.  without them, we'd still be trapped in that tunnel.   they're like heroes.  you know what they deserve.  ..face.   scoobydoobydoobydoo     scoobydoobydoobydoo   scoobydoobydoo.  we
