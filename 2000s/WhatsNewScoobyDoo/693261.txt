 a creepy castle, ..   aah. aah.  velma: there's no such thing as a vampire, shaggy, but it sounds like somebody's trying to scare you out of here.  why would someone do that.  that's what we're gonna find out.  and i know exactly what we need to do.  split up. no.  set a trap.  .  but you always want us to split up before you set a trap.  really. i never noticed that.  ok, here's the plan.  the vampire will stumble into this stack of barrels and roll in here.  the axe will cut this cord, and the drape will land on his head.  that's when we tie up his feet and unmask him.   foolproof.  now, we just need to set the live bait.  like, not us, man.  sounds too fishy to me.  no, not you two.  since the vampire went after the hex girls beforebut those girls are too scared.  we can't put them at risk again.  yeah, you're right, velma.  we just need someone to look like one of them.  my mother would have a heart attack.  why does she get to wear the dress.  because shaggy doesn't have the hips for it.  whaok, velma, start singing.   ..   almost wed, but i fled    almost wed, but i fled    almost wed, but i fled    yeah, yeah    your trap actually worked.  well, what part of "foolproof" didn't you understand.  like, i don't think now's the time for a makeover, daph.  there's always time for a makeover, especially when it's also an unmasking.  all, gasping: who is that.  now, why would a cutie like you want to ruin our video.  ..  trickortreater.  i don't have to tell you anything.  then allow me to fill in the blanks.  i am owen decassle, and this is steve fortescu.  i bought this place from steven's parents, distant descendants of reputed vampire baron fortescu.  you mean you stole my family's pride, stomped on our souls, and now you're profiting off my legacy.  as you can see, .. issues.  now i will leave my castle to take him to the village, where the authorities can deal with him.  uh, mr. decassle, we just came that way.  sorry, but the bridge is out and the roads are all flooded.  then we're stuck here all night with that freaky fortescu kid.  i know a very safe place to keep him out of trouble.  .  like, i'm feeling a lot of things right now, and safe is not one of 'em.  .   you can lock me up, but that won't make a difference, old man.  your problems won't end with me.  you want the real vampire.  ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.  i don't want the real vampire.  i want to go back upstairs.  ..  as soon as i take care of one more thing.   ..you tugged, master.  yikes. yikes.  wretchfield, why don't you show these nice people to their rooms.  .. comfortable.  yow. hehhoo.  get off of me, man.  bad beetle.  my apologies.  max must have wriggled out of his leash.  wretchfield, sir, if you don't mind me asking, how long have you worked here.  i've given my life to this castle.  it used to be a serene place filled with glorious chamber music.  none of this earbleeding, garbled garbage that they dare call music.  think i hit a sore spot.   ..not a hideous space, but positively void of personality.   uh, that doesn't look like a mint on my pillow.  like, i think those beds are already taken, scoob.   oohrooh.  ok, so it may not be a fancy hotel with bugfree beds and tiny soapsheh heh hehbut at least we're safe from that creepy vampire.    huh.   ..  aah.   that sounds like daphne.  whoa. roah.  uh, sorry, mr. vampire.  velma: where'd it go.  hey, what's going on in here.  your vampire crasher made an unscheduled guest appearance in my room.  daphne, were you able to get a good look at the vampire.  you bet i did.  there's no doubt it was steve fortescu.  but that's impossible.  he's locked up in the dungeon.  now, wait a minute.  steve's still sitting right in that cell where we left him.  i don't get it.  ..  maybe, scoob.  maybe when mr. decassle bent down to tie his shoe, steve turned into a bat and flew out between the bars.  scratch that. mr. decassle's wearing slippers.  just because steve's in that jail cell now doesn't mean he wasn't able to get out earlier.  so you agree with our bat theory.  i think somebody's been letting steve out.  velma's right. hmm.  somebody must be working with steve.  that's the only way he could supposedly be in 2 places at once.  now let's split up and look for clues.  i knew that would come up sooner or later.  whoa, scoob, looks like we wandered into the castle's kitchen.  how do you think that happened.  i ron't row.  maybe the vampire's hiding  bingo. ha ha ha.  no vampire and a full fridge.  but what if the vampire shows up for a quick bite.   garlic.  but vampires hate garlic..brilliant idea. heh heh.  what are we waitin' for.  let's get cookin'.  i'm almost done with the garlic bananaberry shake, scoob.  how 'bout those peanut butter and garlic cookies.  .  huh. oh.  what are you two doing here .  uh, leaving.  you know, if cobwebs and dust balls were clues, we'd have this case solved by now.   those screams came from inside this room.  stand back, ladies.  but, fred, it might be unlocked.  well, what fun is that.  fred, velma, daphne, something's happened to dusk.  there was this bizarre flash of light, she disappeared, and then this bat showed up.  i know dusk wanted out of the band, but pretending she turned into a bat.  that's a little extreme.  daphne, velma, look over here.  those stairs probably lead up to the attic.  and, typically, attics are great places to find clues.  unfortunately, nothing's been typical about this case so far.  wow, my purse is more organized than this place.   aah. eww. uhh.  yecch.  probably more of wretchfield's longlost pets.  check this out.  a birth certificate.  but the name is smudged.  it looks like stu fortescu that's weird.  i wonder why steve changed his name.  maybe steve has even more issues than we thought.   either somebody didn't like that remark about steve or someone's in trouble.   cut. cut. cut.  .  velma: hakimoto, we thought the hex girls were being tormented by the vampire again.  oh, i wish.  if he does show up, i'm going to capture him on film, and i'll be rich and famous.  hakimoto presents anything he wants.  correct me if i'm wrong, but i don't think tempting a vindictive vampire is a wise career move.  just when you think it's safe to go back into the castle, .. forever fangs.  in a castle, no one can hear you scream.  aah.  ooh. i've got chills.  can't you just see it.  oh, i can see it.   aah. aah. aah.   he wants my hand    i'll have to think    he'll never have my heart    he'll know that when i seek    wanna wed, but i fled    yeah, yeah    wanna wed, but i fled    yeah, yeah    wanna wed, but i fled    yeah, yeah    wanna wed, but i fled    yeah    i need to hear those 2 words    i'm declining to say those 2 wordsi do    i want a cake with a bride and groom    i want a ring and a   what'd i say.     wanna wed, but i fled   yeah, yeah    wanna wed, but i fled   yeah, yeah    wanna wed, but i fled   yeah, yeah    wanna wed, but i fled   yeah, yeah    yeah   looks like we lost him.  for now.  like, at least we're a lot safer out here ..  .  there's no need to worry.  we left the vampire in the castle.  we're completely safe out here.    what happened to fred.  fred. rrred.  freddy jones .  fred's not around here anywhere.  like, scoob is right.  didn't you see the vicious vampire.  he turned fred into a bat, and there he is.  i really don't think that bat is fred, but i do think it's time to put an end to these vampire hijinks.  and how do we do that.  by doing some research back inside the castle.  don't worry, fred, we won't let you out of our sight.  like, you'll be back to your human self in a shaggy: wait. wait.  i didn't mean i don't like your bat self.  you're fine as a bat.  hmm. hmm.  daphne: it says here that it's legendary for a vampire to come out of his coffin once a year in search of his longlost bride.  ..  in a sick, vampiry kind of way.  look at this.  an old photo of steve standing in front of a mirror.  ..i get it.  steve can't be the vampire because he's casting a reflection.  i may not know everything about vampires, but i know a lot about mirrors.  it explains more than that.  in fact, i think i've got this mystery just about wrapped up.  now all we need to do is catch that vampire.  i sure wish fred were here.  you know, i think a woman is better suited for this job.  ok, now, don't move a wink.  shaggy: oh, no.  fred got mixed up with a rogue gang of bats.  like, we've gotta figure out which one he is.  you think this is fred.   you're right, this bat does have muscular wings, but this other one looks like he's formulating a plan.  huh.  that friendly guy's gotta be him.  like, fredbat, wait for us.   .  i'm perfect vampire bride material.  yes, you are.  now, i'm sure the vampire will show up any minute.  velma, do you think we're doing all this to trap a real vampire.  no, of course not.  then why do you have a whole box of garlic behind you.  it never hurts to have a backup plan.   it's him.  now get out there and strut your stuff.  aah. unh. whoa.  hiya, daph.  and, like, see ya, daph.  oh. unh.  uhh.  the net. velma, the net.  uhh.  freddy.  hang in there, fang boy.  thanks, fred.  you saved my life.  actually, i was just climbing down from the attic, where i was trapped, but you're welcome anyway.  what happened. where's the vampire.  did he get away.  nope. he's right over there.  oh, no, he's gone.  well, guess it looks like i won't be needing these anymore.  wow, i guess garlic really does work on vampires.  dusk: yeah, that's the creep who had me locked up, too.  be careful, daphne.  don't worry, it's hypoallergenic.  all: steve fortescu.  ..  but we don't have a clue who's been helping him escape from his cell.  that's not exactly true.  it's no makeup effect.  steve and the vampire look identical because they're twin brothers.  of course.  how else could anyone be in 2 places at one time, unless they look exactly alike.  i bet that birth certificate with the name stu really belongs to steve's brother here.  and this photo of steve looking in the mirror was really just the 2 brothers standing face to face.  ok, but that still doesn't explain why they wanted to trash our video shoot.  i think they wanted to scare everybody off and ruin owen's business.  steve, stu: and it would have worked if it weren't for you meddling kids.  hi, everybody.  you'll be happy to know we finally caught fredbat.  oh, hello, fred.  ..  then who's this on my shoulder.   uhhuhhuhh.  aah.   coming soon to your

they're dreaming aboutgiant cereal again, aren't they.  do they ever stop.  come on, you guys.  wrestling is a veryserious business, andhey, it's sparrow man.  now listen here,my finefeathered friend, you and your tightsworks for me, so i expect you to wrestle tonight.  no way.  we're not wrestling with that monster running around.  you have to cancel tonight's match.  scooby & shaggy: monster. fred: cancel.  ..  if you would've made us the star attraction.  what kind of monster is it.  oh, heh heh heh.  well, it's not a monster, per se, darling.  it's just athe titanic twist.  someone tell me that that's just the name of a totally awesome slurpee.  hardly.  the titanic twist was a wrestling move so dangerous, so bonecrushing, that it was outlawed years ago after the only time it was ever used.  the poor wrestler who fell victim to it never knew what hit him.  and now, after all these years, his ghost has come back.  an evil contorted beast, seeking revenge on the wrestling world for turning their backs on him.  can't you just postpone the match until you capture the monster.  no. no.  little lady, i got too much riding on this night to cancel.  besides, i'm betting this little twisty fella is good for publicity.  well, count me out, bosepheus.  i'm not gonna wrestle.  oh, whwhere i'm gonna find someone else on such short notice.  ahem.  um, fred.  where did you get that.  oh, this. heh heh.  it's my "in case of an emergency" wrestling costume.  neat, huh.  .. interesting.  shiny. reah.  ok, scientist, what do you call this wrestling move.  the atomic drop.   that's a good name for it.  it says here that abner doubleday invented modern wrestling in 1839 while a cadet at west point.  but i find it hard to believe our future leaders needed to learn the frontface blizzard suflex.  unh. ooh. ohh. ow.  actually, the frontface blizzard suflex was a favorite move of president ford.  hey, it's malachi crunch.  mr. crunch, i am your biggest fan.  hunh. uhh.  glad to hear it, son.  dad, i thought you promised you weren't going near the ring.  you've already won the championship belt.  you don't have to risk getting injured ever again.  heh. you'll have to excuse my kids.  sometimes they get a little overprotective.  are you kidding.  what could happen to you around here.  ohh. ohh. ohh. ohh. ohh. ohh.  come on, dad, we're leaving.  unh. oof.  it seems like if anyone could take care of himself, it would be malachi.  he's the world wrestling champ.  even i know that.  hey, and i know something, too.  that guy is scary.  arrr. arr. )
