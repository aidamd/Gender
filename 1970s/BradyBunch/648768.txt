 bobby, you give kitty back.  you stop picking on him.  .  he didn't do anything.  he did.  i did not.  he did.  he did not.  what's going on.  he took it.  he did not.  hold it.   will somebody fill me in.  cindy's doll is missing and the girls think bobby took it.  well, bobby.  i didn't take it.  he did, too.  i did not.   cut.  all right, everybody into his room, come on.   quiet.   let's just settle down in there.  come on, settle down.  honey, i know bobby.  if he says he didn't take the doll i believe him.  well, cindy always tells the truth, too.  i believe she thinks he took it but maybe she dropped it somewhere.  kids are always misplacing things.  that's true.  one time marcia lost her left shoe and a month later, we found it in the freezer.  i'll go talk to the kids again.  it won't do any good.  i've talked to them and they don't know where it is.  then we'll search the house until we find the doll.  all right, kids, let's fall in for search detail.  come on, hop to it.  come on.  come on, hurry up, let's go.  come on, girls.  can i help you, mr. brady.  no, thanks, alice.  what are you looking for.  a doll.  in the refrigerator.  why not.  just as apt to be here as anywhere.  what are you looking for now.  same doll.  if i'd known you wanted a doll so bad i'd have baked one.   still looking for that doll.  yeah.  brady, it's none of my business but the next time you play golf maybe you better wear a sunbonnet.  i've got to find that doll.  mrs. brady, what are you doing.  alice, you'll never guess what i'm looking for.  a doll.  how did you know.  there's a lot of that going around.  i've found it, i've found it.  kitty.  no, the earring i lost last week.  my skate key.  i thought i'd never see it again.  well, we got to look some more.  no, we've done all we can do here.  you sure have.  .. if i was a doll, where would i go.  to me, sweetheart.  that's all you think aboutgirls.  never mind that, keep looking.  there's nothing over here.  well, it's got to be someplace.  try somewhere else.  what did you find.  oh, nothing.  come on, what is it.  nothing, just an old candy bar i lost a long time ago.  how do you know it's yours.  i once lost one, too.  was yours dark chocolate with almonds.  .. yeah, that's the one.  well, too badthis one's vanilla fudge.  nyah.  come on, you guys there's no doll around here.  did you get the license number of the truck that went through here.  doggone it, we lost the whole morning looking for that stupid doll.  what if dad makes us keep looking forever.  oh, no.  i'm glad she's gone.  i hated that doll.  maybe cindy was right.  maybe you did take it after all.  i didn't.  come on, peter.  what does he care if we never have any fun again.  hey, what about me.  yeah, what about you.  one thing's sureit isn't in the house.  i've searched every nook and cranny.  mike, look at this.  can i play.  beat it. get out of here. nobody wants you.  go on.  this has gone far enough.  mike: pay very careful attention to what i'm going to say.  i'm talking to you two because you're the oldest.  you see, in this country we're very proud to have a process known as the law and under the law a man is presumed innocent until he's proven guilty.  right, dad.  in other words we don't hang anybody without a fair trial.  everybody knows that.  sure, but sometimes we tend to forget.  well, i'm glad you understand.  see you kids later.  i have to go shopping with your mother.  bye.  you know something. dad's right.  we don't know for sure bobby's guilty.  nobody saw him take that doll.  right, let's give him a fair trial.  good.  then we'll hang him.  aw, come on, kids.  now, i haven't got time to fool around.  but alice, we've got to have a judge.  mom and dad aren't home.  okay, okay, but no loopholes, no long habeas corpusesi've got a pot roast in the oven.  thanks, alice.  we got it all set up.  you sit up there.  oyez, oyez, court is now in session.  judge alice presiding.  i'll be the d.a.  because everybody knows he's guilty.  i objectthere's something illegal about that.  come on, let's get this case on the road.  marcia: you two are the jury.  alice: order in the court.  okay, d.a., call your first witness.  my first witness is cindy herself.  .. sit down here.  now, tell the jury what happened in your own words.  well, kitty's gone and bobby took her because nobody else was there and those are my own words.  does that mean we vote "guilty" now.  hey, i want a chance to say something.  alice: barrister, you may proceed.  okay, defendant, what's your name.  you know my name.  i know, but i want the jury to hear it.  they know my name, too.  everybody here knows my name.  let me at him.  where were you on the night of march 9.  before or after 9:00.  what difference does it make.  i'm not allowed up past 9:00.  he's guilty, all right.  bobby: i'm not guilty.  i didn't take it, no matter what she says.  i wouldn't do a thing like that.  maybe we fight sometimes ..  well, i just wouldn't do a thing like that.  well, jury, you've heard both sides.  now it's deliberating time.  make it snappyi can smell that pot roast from here.  i know jan will vote guilty.  peter and bobby are just like that.  he won't vote against him.  have you reached a verdict.  yes, your honor.  " " you've been saying all along he's guilty.  i changed my mind after his speech.  i knew i'd pull you through.  peter: just a minute.  " that's immaterial.  a while ago, you said he was innocent.  i deliberated, and he's guilty.  well, looks like we've got a hung jury.  alice, something's burning.  my pot roast.  case dismissed.  whoa.  look out, kids.  .. oh, no.  it's going to be hotlook out.   now i know why judges get paid so muchthey got to keep buying new pot roasts.  harder.  greg: come on, bobby.  burn it in.  hey, greg's playing with bobby.  that little talk about fair play seems to have done some good.  carol: yep.  hey, dad.  ..  mike: yes.  would you burn some in to me.  bobby can't pitch well.  maybe later, greg.  peter's a good pitcher.  yeah, a good pitcher but a rotten jury.  come on, bobby.  what's that all about.  don't ask me.  i only live here.  marcia: mom, would you ask jan to give me back my curlers.  why don't you ask her yourself.  me talk to benedict arnold.  i'd sooner be disbarred.  what's that about.  don't ask me.  i only live here.   say, where'd he come from.  from africa.  mommy brought him for me.  he looks groovy.   neato.   beat it, tiger.  dogs don't belong in a jungle.  scram. scoot.   boy, he's the smartest elephant i ever saw.  he's not half as smart as kitty.  she used to talk to me all the time.  she never talked to me.  that's because you were mean to her.  you took her away.  you better not say that.  i had a fair trial, and they said i was immaterial.  they did not.  @ it was a hangedup jury.  over again, jumbo.  wait a minutei'll play you some music.  where's my kazoo.  dad, dad.  my kazoo, it's gone.  it was right here.  you took it.  you took my kazoo.  i did not.  you did so.  all right, all right.  what's up, bobby.  she took my kazoo.  i did not.  now, just a minute.  maybe you put it in your pocket.  no, i didn't.  i'll show you.  is that it.  just about.  i've got another pocket.  sure you don't have your bicycle in there.  anything else.  a couple of more things.  there.  that proves she took my kazoo.  no, it proves no such thing.  if cindy says she didn't take it, i believe her the same way i believed you.  ..  come here, cindy, sit down.  i want to tell you something.  sometimes we can be deceived by circumstantial evidence.  circumspecial.  no, circumstantial.  .. that's when things look different than they really are.  like when a lady puts on false eyelashes.  something like that.  you see, each one of you knows that he's innocent but the way things look, they think the other one is guilty.  and that's not right.  no, no, far from it.  do you know, sometimes innocent men go to jail because of circumstantial evidence.  okay.  then i believe cindy's innocent.  and i believe bobby's innocent.  good.  even if he's guilty.   well, i wish i had better news.  i searched the house againno doll, no kazoo.  .. bobby here seems to be bearing up a little better than cindy.  well, i guess maybe girls must love dolls more than boys love kazoos.  i remember once i lost my favorite doll and i cried for over a week.  boy, you must have got everybody in the house wet.  i think i did.  i think we ought to keep on searching.  it's bound to turn up, hmm.  okay.  come on, bobby.   there you are, young lady.  i'm sure you're going to have a lot of fun with this.  thank you, ma'am.  come again.  hello there, young man.  can i help you.  yeah, i want to buy something for my sister even if she says i did and i didn't.  do what.  well, it's called "circumspecial" or something and it's real bad even though cindy doesn't understand because she's so young.  well, she's lucky to have a brother like you.  you're not kidding.  ..  kitty.  that's kittkarryall.  and that's the last one i have.  keep running out.  boy, will cindy be happy.  i'll take it.  okay.  you mean you're willing to spend so much money on your sister.  my whole life savings.  have i got enough.  well, let's see.  .. three cents over.  how's that.  okay.  there we are.  byebye, now.  bye.  and i'm not giving this to you because i like you or anything like that.  ..  well, my piggy bank was getting too full and i had to buy something.  now, isn't it wonderful to have a brother like that.  and it's not even your birthday.  oh, i think kitty's trying to say something.  come here, kitty.  what's that.  oh, you want your mommy to hold you.  here.  would you like me to fix her a bottle and then you can put her to bed.  ..   i'm sorry, but it's not my kitty.  but honey, she's exactly the same.  they're like twins.  it's only a matter of getting used to her.  ..  oh, mike, what are we going to do.  she's heartbroken.  a little time, like you said she'll get used to it.  tiger.  come back here.  carol: tiger.   mike: maybe he's at the neighbor's.  carol: no, the gate's locked.  mike: let's try the backyard.  tiger.  cindy,
