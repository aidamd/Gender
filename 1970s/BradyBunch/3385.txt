oh, honey, we were sure it was just a mistake.  oh, goodness, i've got to run.  i've got to get alice to the dentist.  i'm sorry about the bike mixup, dad.  i guess i was in such a hurry to get home

let you go down...  that's funny.  i could have sworn the swelling was on the other side.  you better hurry before it hurts on both sides.  come on, scoot.  glad it isn't my wisdom teeth.  i need all

i'll have it framed and delivered to your house.  oh, listen, no, don't deliver it.  call me when it's ready and i'll pick it up, 'cause it's a surprise.  a surprise... oh, i love surprises.  hey,

everything these daysrush, rush, rush.  hi, honey, how's everything at the office.  i got to come home a little early today.  good.  what's that.  well, it's a letter we got today from jan's teacher, mrs. denhoff. let's see.  she says jan's grades have been falling off.  "lacking energy and having trouble concentrating".  huh, that's not like jan.  i know, i can't understand it.  she's always been a good student.  honey, i'd like you to read this letter.  it's from your teacher, mrs. denhoff.  i'm sorry.  i'll try to do better.  jan, read it again.  this time out loud.  no, no, no... from here.  "dear mr. and mrs. brady...  "in the post... in thepastseveral weeks jan's grades..." that's enough, jan.  honey, where do you sit in mrs. denhoff's class.  in the back, why.  does she write lessons on the blackboard in the front of the class.  usually.  jan, i think you may need glasses.  glasses..  oh, mom, no, not glasses.  i certainly think you ought to have your eyes checked.  honey, wearing glasses isn't anything these days.  but i'm sure i don't need glasses.  well, look, jan, you want to keep failing in school.  making mistakes like taking the wrong bicycle.  glasses, wow.  i'll look positively goofy.  when bernie maguire sees me, he'll go bananas.  bananas.  that's bad, huh.  it's the worst.  hi, mr. brady.  : follow me into the garage.  mr. gaylord delivered your anniversary picture.  oh, no. i distinctly asked him not to.  well, luckily, while mrs. brady was out with jan.  i hid it out here in the garage.  hey, thanks, alice.  i think it'll be safe out here.  i mean, mrs. brady knows your anniversary is coming up and she's already been snooping in the house.  she's a pretty good snooper.  good work, aliceshe'll never think to look in the garage.  wrong. she already did, mr. brady.  but there would be no point in her snooping in here again.  once she's already snooped it, it's snooped out.  alice, your talk is a little like your meat loafa little bit of everything and all mixed up.   that must be mom and jan.  they went to get jan's new glasses.  i bet she looks funny in them.  yeah. can't wait to see old foureyes.  let's not have any "foureyes" jokes.  jan's going to feel selfconscious enough without you teasing her.  she'll know we're just joking.  people don't like those kinds of personal jokes.  how would you like it if somebody called you... shorty.  i wouldn't care.  okay, shorty.  you cut that out.  see.  hi, honey.  hi. hi, kids.  hey, they look great.  those frames are beautiful.  right, kids.  yeah.  terrific.  thanks.  she picked them out herself.  ah, they're perfect. they really suit her.  hey, honey, come on, i want to show you these great towels i got on sale today.  okay.  jan.  yeah.  where are your glasses.  in my purse.  why aren't you wearing them.  well, i'm meeting bernie maguire at the library.  so.  so bernie hasn't seen me in glasses, and he's not going to, if i can help it.  well, mom and dad said you were supposed to wear your glasses.  well, i will, whenever i really need them.   i think you're being dumb.  but they're your eyes.  ciao.  ciao.  jan. jan.  jan, look out.   are you all right.  yeah, i, i think so.  let me look.  yeah, i just...  i guess i just misjudged the distance.  yeah... hey, no wonder.  why aren't you wearing your glasses.  is my bike okay.   oh, no.  oh, no.  dad's anniversary gift to mom.  boy, have you done it.  it's ruined.  a woman who loves to share her passions.  grandma.  mary has atrial fibrillation, an irregular heartbeat not caused by a heart valve problem.  that puts her at a greater risk of stroke.  rome.  sure.  before xarelto, mary took warfarin, which required monthly trips to get her blood tested.  but that's history.  back to the museum.  not this time.  now that her doctor switched her to onceaday xarelto, mary can leave those monthly trips behind.  domestic flight.  not today.  like warfarin, xarelto is proven effective to reduce afibrelated stroke risk.  but xarelto is the first and only onceaday prescription blood thinner for patients with afib not caused by a heart valve problem that doesn't require regular blood monitoring.  so mary is free of that monitoring routine.  for patients currently well managed on warfarin, there is limited information on how xarelto and warfarin compare in reducing the risk of stroke.  xarelto is just one pill a day taken with the evening meal.  spinach.  grazie.  plus, with no known dietary restrictions, mary can eat the healthy foods she likes.  don't stop taking xarelto, rivaroxaban, unless your doctor tells you to.  while taking xarelto, you may bruise more easily and it may take longer for bleeding to stop.  xarelto may increase your risk of bleeding if you take certain medicines.  xarelto can cause serious bleeding, and in rare cases, may be fatal.  get help right away if you develop unexpected bleeding, unusual bruising, or tingling.  if you have had spinal anesthesia while on xarelto, watch for back pain or any nerve or muscle related signs or symptoms.  do not take xarelto if you have an artificial heart valve or abnormal bleeding.  tell your doctor before all planned medical or dental procedures.  before starting xarelto, tell your doctor about any conditions, such as kidney, liver, or bleeding problems.  switching to xarelto was the right move for mary.  ask your doctor about onceaday xarelto.  no regular bloodmonitoring. no known dietaryrestrictions.  for information andsavings options download the xareltopatient center app, call 1888xarelto, or visit goxarelto.com rich,

oh...  did you get hold of the photographer.  yeah, but remember how mixed up he was when we took the pictures.  yeah.  well, he's still mixed up.  what's that supposed to mean.  he can't find the negative.  you mean he lost it. yeah.  he says it's his fault so if we want to take a new picture, he won't charge for the new negative.  peter: hey, great.  yeah, but he has to charge for the new

photographer's tomorrow right after school.  and tell them to wear the same clothes so that nobody will be able to tell it's a different picture.  but, jan, where are you going to get the money.  what

figure i better look really heavy.  hmm. i look really heavy no matter what i wear.  i'll see you later.  anchovies away.  alice: hey.  hey, wait a minute, you guys.  where do you think you're going in your good clothes.  uh... out to play.  uh, yeah, play.  since when do you get dressed up to go out and play.  well, you see, our play clothes are clean and these good clothes are kind of dirty, so we don't want to get our play clothes dirty.  right, bobby.  uh, yeah, this way we just get our good clothes dirtier.  and you don't have to wash our play clothes.  yeah. bye, so long.  bye.  i think i detect a little fancy footwork here.    well, what perfect timing.  my, don't we look pretty.  well, thanks, mom.  yeah, thanks.  well, see, kids today are always wearing jeans and stuff like that,

the other kids' fault.  i ruined the first one because i wasn't wearing my glasses.  i ran into it with my bike, in the garage.  jan, you know you're lucky you only ran into the picture.  you could have run into something much worse, like a car.  i'm sorry, dad.  i'll wear my glasses from now on, whenever i'm supposed to, i promise.  well, as a little reminder, i'm afraid i'm going to have to ground you.  two weeks.  no bicycle.  dad, could you make it something else.  you can't ground me from riding my bicycle.  oh, yes, i'm afraid i can.  well, i don't have a bicycle anymore.  i sold it
