 come on, spunker, just jump.  jump.  just a little jump.  hi, where'd you get the frog.  burke's pond.  no, i bought him at the pet store.  the pet store.  there's hundreds at burke's pond.  but this is a special frog.  hi.  .. thanks for opening your big mouth.  now i get to ride my bike instead of drive the car.  peter: what happened.  i'm grounded for a whole week .. him.  i was just telling mom and dad what a great driver you are.  how old are you.  eleven.  that's amazing.  what is.  how anyone could get so stupid in such a short time.  he won't think i'm so stupid when spunker wins.  wins what.  the pet store's having a big frogjumping contest.  can anybody enter the contest.  no, it's just for frogs.  very funny.  where you going.  down to burke's pond to get a frog.  i'm getting in that contest.  you'll just get a plain old frog down there not a thoroughbred like spunker.  right, spunker.   .. no, i struck out.  i had to ride my bike all the way down to the music store and they're sold out like every store is sold out.  i think the only way to get tickets to that rock concert now is to drive all the way down to the stadium.  me.no, i can't.  i can't use the car.  can't you get them.  well, i promised rachel i'd take her to the concert.  i got to get tickets.   well, hey, maybe howie marshall can use his car, huh.  right, i'll find out, goodbye.   is that bobby's frog.  no, he's mine.  i got him at burke's pond.  what's his name.  " that's a dumb name.  " " .. yeah, old croaker, good idea.  .   he likes it.  i better get some leaves for his house.  here, hold him.  oh, no, not me.  me, either.  he's all slimy.  girls.  that'll hold you for a minute.  hey, peter.  yeah.  did you see that.  see what.  never mind.   oh.  hello, greg.  hi, dad.  did you finish your plans.  yeah, yeah, i did, finally.  good, could i see them.  what, the plans.  sure, if you don't mind.  thanks.  terrific.  these are probably the best plans you've ever done.  thank you.  ..  no.  please, just this one exception.  there's no way i can get tickets without driving the car.  greg, when i said you were grounded, i meant it.  but the tickets will all be gone in a couple hours.  dad, i'll drive straight there and straight home.  you cannot drive the car for one week, period.  george, hi, greg brady.  yeah, hey, i haven't talked to you in a long time.  listen, pal, you're my last chance to get tickets to a rock concert saturday night.  if you're not doing anything how about coming over and picking me up and we'll go down and get them.  oh, no, i didn't know you were sick.  no, i can't use our car for about a week.  ..  oh, that's an idea, yeah.  hi, carol.  oh, hi, jenny.  looks like you're going to feed an army.  yeah, well, with six kids i've got an army.  do you need a lift home.  no, thanks, i've got my car.  well, that's funny.  what's funny.  i thought yours was still at the mechanic's.  the mechanic's.  what on earth made you think that.  well, when greg came over to borrow george's car i just assumed something was wrong with yours.  greg borrowed george's car.  to go out to the stadium and pick up tickets to some rock concert.  jenny said he borrowed george's car.  now, if he didn't, why would she say it.  oh, honey, i just can't believe that greg would deliberately disobey us.  dad.  jan said you wanted to see me.  yes, i do.  greg, did you get tickets for the rock concert.  yes.  did you drive george's car to the stadium.  i met mrs. thompson at the market.  she mentioned it.  yeah, i drove george's car.  after you'd been told not to drive.  you didn't tell me not to drive.  yes, i did.  you said not to use our car.  greg, we told you not to drive.  our car.  you didn't say i couldn't drive any car.  you knew what we meant.  dad, you said not to use our car for a week and i haven't.  aw, greg, come on.  that's walking a pretty fine line.  are you saying you didn't understand that we meant no driving.  i just know what you told me and that was not to drive our car.  okay, greg, okay, but let's make no mistake about this: except for school, you are not to leave this house for the next ten days.  .  i'll miss the rock concert.  you can't mean that.  oh, yes i can and i do.  and i don't want to hear another word about it.  aw.  my yearning for your comfort began hours ago, but for the cashier's sake, let's be coy.  let's pretend this was all spontaneous.  oh, pleasure to meet you, caramel.  life's better the milky way.  my congestion is so bad right now i really am lookingforward to getting relief.  i've never used afrin before.  relief.  oh, it's like night and day.  can i keep this.  afrin. why suffer.  ..  keep it up, honey.  50 of those a day is supposed to keep you very healthy.  .. oh, i think staying healthy is going to kill me.   yes.  it's greg.  come in.  ..  you always said you'd listen to me if i had something to say.  that's right.  got something to say.  it's unfair to ground me when i didn't disobey you.  oh, greg, haven't we been through all that.  well, you said you'd listen.  right, go ahead.  if you had said not to drive for a week that would have meant any car.  you knew what we meant.  that's not what you said.  you said not to drive our car.  would that have made any difference.  it would have made it perfectly clear.  in other words the misunderstanding was our fault.  no, it wasn't your fault.  it's just that i wish you could have used more exact words.  that's what you would like from now onexact words.  sure, then there's no communication gap.  are you prepared to live by the same rules.  absolutely.  all right.  your mother and i believe ..  but if you want to live by exact words, okay.  then i'm not grounded for ten days.  noyou still have four days to go on that freeway incident.  okay.  then i won't miss the concert.  good night.  both: good night.   i'm not sure we should have let him get away with that.  well, honey, i don't think we're letting him get away with anything because exact words are pretty hard to live by.  okay, old croaker, this is just a warmup.  show them you're the best frog.  come on, old croaker.  remember, spunker, you're a thoroughbred.  you can take him easy.  are you ready, bobby.  yeah, i'm ready.  the first one to jump off the tarp is the winner, okay.  ..  ..  go.   come on, old croaker.  come on, old croaker.  catch him, spunker.  spunker, move.   come on, old croaker.  come on, old croaker.  ..  come on, croaker.  just a little more, come on.   yay.  atta boy, old croaker.  come on, let's go give him a treat.  ..  ..  what's the matter.  you okay, spunker.  spunker.  he looks sick.  maybe he ate a bad fly or something.  what if he doesn't feel like jumping tomorrow.  here, why don't you hold him.   spunker.  you hold him.  where you going.  down to burke's pond.  i'm going to go get a plain old froga mutt.  i think we just became frogsitters.  bleh.   hi, dad.  hi, greg, i didn't hear you come in.  how long have you been home.  15 minutes.  i said i'd be home and ready for bed by 11:00.  my exact words.  your exact words.  right.  well, good night.  good night.  oh, greg.  did you get around to washing your mother's car today.  oh, i'm sorry, i forgot.  i'll do it tomorrow.  you said you'd do it today.  ..  were those your exact words.  my exact words.   come in.  mom.  where's dad.  taking a shower.  i had one, too.  tell him i finished washing the car.  i lived up to my exact words.  i certainly will.  good night.  oh, just a minute, marcia told me you were changing chores with her this week.  the other day she took out the trash.  i said i'd do her next chore.  good, hers was tonight.  tonight.  tonight.  and tonight has exactly 15 minutes left.  i can't remember which one is herman.  now, you're flash.  no, you're flash.  i thought you went to get one frog not drain the pond dry.  i got to find herman, he's my best jumper but they all look alike.  not to another frog, they don't.  very funny.  hey, look, why don't you put them all in a line and the one that jumps the farthest has got to be herman.  hey, yeah, that's a great idea.  you're a lot smarter than you look.  hey, come back here.  come on, help me.  ..  help me put them all down.  that must be herman.  yeah, it's going to be a great concert, rachel.  i'll pick you up at 7:00.  right.  goodbye.  can we leave at 7:00 tonight.  can we leave at 7:00.  the contest starts at 8:00.  contest.  yeah, the big frogjumping contest.  you said you'd take us.  sorry, you guys, no way.  but you promised.  that was before this came up.  you guys better make some other plans.  did you say you'd take them, greg.  that was before i knew about the concert.  did you put on conditions like, "unless something else comes up".  no, he didn't.   no, i didn't, but that's what i meant.  we're not talking about what you meant.  we're talking about your exact words.  that's great, what am i going to tell rachel.  tell her there's a big frogjumping contest.  rachel, i hate to tell you this but i can't take you to the concert tonight.  oh, no, why not.  well, it's kind of a long story, but i've got to take my brothers to a... frogjumping contest.  a frogjumping contest.  there's just no way out, honest.  i can't blame you for being angry.  well, things can come up.  i understand that.  you're not sore at me.  i promised to take you to the concert.  i know, and i'm sorry about that but maybe we can go to a movie after that frogjumping contest.  rachel, you are the greatest, grooviest most understanding person in the whole world.  does that mean yes or no to a movie.  i'll pick you up at 9:30.  goodbye.  bye.  listen, i'm in a hurry.  i still have to pick up rachel.  thanks for taking us, greg.  even if my frog came in 35th.  mine came in 49th.  our frogs sure bombed out.  ..  we left them in the car.  the frogs.  greg, wait.  wait, you got the frogs.  i bet you no one else ever went to a drivein movie with a bunch of frogs.  sorry i took so long.  there's really a line at that snack bar.  pizza smells fantastic.  yeah.  the last time we came to a drivein i had to bring my kid brother along, remember.  how could i forget.  what a pest.  yeah, this time we're alone.  all alone.  oh, no.  my brothers' frogs.  oh, rachel, i'm sorry.  we can get him out of here.  can you get it.  oh, that does it.  you may have invented a whole new dishpepperonifrog pizza.  it would have been a wipeout if rachel hadn't been such a good sport.  yeah, and none of it would've happened " say, you suppose we could forget about that.  that's a deal.  good night, dad.  good night, honey.  good night.  let's get some sleep, honey.  i got to get up early.  hey, don't i get a good night kiss.  you didn't say anything about a good night kiss.  hmm.  you said you had to get some sleep.  those were your exact words.  oh, but that's not what i meant.  oh, well, go ahead.  on the other hand those were my exact words.  oh, now, mike, come on, come on.  give me a kiss.  i'll give you a kiss.    here's the sty
