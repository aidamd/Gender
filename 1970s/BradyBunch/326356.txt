i, for one, would feel absolutely humiliated to be sat for.  so would i.  i think we ought to take a firm stand with mom and dad.  right. no babysitter for us.  i'll do all the talking, but you keep nodding your head a lot.  okay, but you've got to look likewemean it.  don't worry. i will.  i'll look them straight in the eye and tell them we do mean it.  and i promise to back you up.  why don't

right, greg.  just remind where we were, would you.  of course. what is it, kids.  marcia and i would like to talk to you for a moment.  sure.  go ahead.  well. what is it, greg.  we're bugged about something, dad.  real bugged.  about what.  marcia and i think we're too old to have a babysitter, and we're very firm about that.  marcia: very firm about that.  too old, huh.  yes, sir. too old.  i'm 14.  i'm 13.  kids our age are babysitters.  they have a very good point.  yeah.  somehow, when they're your own, they seem younger.  then we can sit for ourselves tonight.  it's all right with me if it's all right with your mother.  well, why not.  great.  thanks, mom.  okay. your tour of duty will start at approximately 6:00, at which time i'm going to take your mother to a very fancy restaurant.  6:00. check. come on, marcia.   dad.  now what.  babysitters get 75 cents an hour.  what.  each.  each.  they sure are growing up.  now, i'm trusting all of you to be on your extrabest behavior tonight with greg and marcia.  cindy: gee, mom.  you mean you're leaving us all alone.  what a dodo.  she just got through telling you we're going to be with you.  it's not being alone.  you want to bet.  mom, does this mean we have to follow their orders.  especially his.  your father and i have left instructions with greg and marcia.  they'll be acting for us.  does that answer your questions.  yeah.  we have to follow orders.  good thinking.   cindy, are you coming down with the sniffles.  if i am, i don't want greg or marcia blowing my nose.  i can do it myself.  okay, greg and marcia, you heard that.  no noseblowing for cindy.  well, i guess that does it.  i better go get dressed.   cindy, are you sure you're feeling all right.  fine.  well, just to be sure, i think we better take your temperature.  i'll help, mom.  come on, jan. let's watch tv.  everything under control.  i have the sniffles.  but i can blow my own nose.  sniffles.  oh, she's fine, mike.  greg...  i want to make sure now that you remember everything.  would you stop worrying.  you said you trusted us.  right. right.  i do.  you smell something.  smoke's coming out of the television set.  what do you do.  get everybody out of the house and call the fire department.  hotwater pipe bursts. what do you do.  i don't take a bath.  not you. him.  i turn off the main valve and call the plumber.  yeah.  right. go get your face washed... knowitall.  dad. why do babysitters have to know so much.  well, because...  they're here to protect you while mom and dad are out of the house.  protect us from what.  oh, bobby, all kinds of things.  accidents, stranger at the door.  i don't know any strangers.  bobby, come with me.  come with me.  now, i'm going to go outside and knock on the door.  did you lose your key.  huh.  no, i didn't lose my key.  i just want to show you something.  what are you doing.  trying to see what you're doing.  never mind that. now, just do what i told you.   hi, daddy.  never open the front door without asking who it is.  now... try it again.  okay.   who is it.  it's daddy.  that's very good.  now... this time, i'm going to be a stranger.  and a stranger is somebody that we don't know, okay.  and we never open doors for people we don't know.  right.  right.   who is it.  my name is herman. can i come in.  no. you're a stranger.  okay, bobby, time to get cleaned up for dinner.  but... but...  no buts. go on. move along. move...   : i'm a little old lady, and i want to use your telephone. let me in.  : yeah, that's good, bobby.  okay, open the door.   come on, open up. i'm not a stranger anymore.  for somebody who's not a stranger, you're certainly acting mighty strange.  i was just...  i was telling bobby about strangers, and not to open the door, and i was herman and...   ...he went off, and you came up, and i... it's kind of funny, isn't it.  hilarious.  carol.  carol...  oh, there you are.  gorgeous.   alice, sam's here.  we all set.  i... i think so.  something's wrong.  no.  i'm not going to let a little sniffle of cindy's spoil our night out.   she have any fever.  none at all.  then everything's fine.  does who have a fever.  cindy. but she hasn't.  just the sniffles.  oh, my. i hope it doesn't turn into something worse.  you know kids and sniffles.   have a nice time, everybody.  there's sam tooting again.  well, i don't know that i should go, mrs.  brady, with cindy sick and all.  alice, cindy is not sick.  she just has the sniffles.  what do you think greg and i are here for.  still, i think i'd better tell sam to forget about it.  alice...  you'll do no such thing.  alice, mrs. brady and i have the utmost confidence in the babysitters we have engaged for the evening.  cindy's in excellent hands.  well, okay. enjoy the show.  happy curtainhanging, alice.  it's our turn.  yeah.  let's go, honey.  oh, listen, kids, i...  we know where all the phone numbers are, mom.  and we'll lock the door right behind you.  have a nice time.  good night, sweetheart.  good night.   you didn't say, "who is it." only because i knew who it was.  you didn't chain the door.  parents.  certainly hard to bring up.  .  i've got plans.  and this is my baby right now.  so, it's just not the right time to get pregnant.  that's why i chose skyla.  skyla is the smallflexible iud that prevents pregnancy for up to 3 years.  so for me, there are no daily pills or monthly refills.  i got my skyla placed in just a few minutes in my ob/gyn's office.  and if i want to try to get pregnant i can get it removed whenever i want.  vo: if you have a pelvic infection, get infections easily, or have certain cancers, don't use skyla.  less than 1% of users get a serious infection called pid.  if you have persistent pelvic or stomach pain or if skyla comes out, tell your doctor.  skyla may attach or go through the uterus and cause other problems.  pregnancy while using skyla is uncommon but can be life threatening and may result in loss of pregnancy or fertility.  ovarian cysts may occur but usually disappear.  bleeding and spotting may increase in the first 3 to 6 months and remain irregular.  periods over time usually become shorter, lighter, or may stop.  skyla does not protect against hiv or stds.  .  talk to your ob/gyn about making the move to skyla.  vo: check with your insuranceto find out if you can get skylaat no cost.   marcia...  where you going with that.  cindy. she said her sniffles make her thirsty for milk.  boy, oh, boy, is she sneaky.  she told me her sniffles made her hungry for chocolate cake.  do you have to eat that in here.  what's wrong with it.  get a napkin.  i don't want apple juice dribbling all over the furniture for me to get blamed for.  what a grouch.   peter, can't you sit up.  sure. why.  very funny.  you'll put a hole in the chair with your shoe.  do you mind.  happy now, mr. dictator.  okay, wise guy.  how'd you like to go to bed early and miss that movie on tv tonight.  you can't make me do that.  i sure can, for not showing proper respect to your sitter.  oh.  that's better.   jan, will you hang up the phone if you're not talking to anyone.  just a minute, gloria.  it so happens that i am talking to gloria, but i am not talking at the moment because i am listening to her do the talking.  go ahead, gloria.   kids.   would you care for something from the bar.  carol.  no, i think i'd rather have a nice wine with dinner.  me, too. may we have the wine list, please.  very good, sir.  isn't this a charming place.  yeah. now that we've found it, let's come here more often, hmm.  a very good idea, mr. brady.   what'll it be.  steaks, good burgundy or...  fish and chablis. what do you think.  i think we should have left this number with greg and marcia.  aw, honey, they know where we are.  we could go whole hog and have lobster and champagne.  what do you say.  i wish i'd had the kids check her temperature.  you promised to stop worrying about cindy.  now, she's in good hands, right.  right.  wine list, sir.  oh, thank you.  all right, what'll it be.  burgundy, chablis or champagne.  oh, not champagne.  you know the bubbles make me sneeze.  yeah, me, too.  and speaking of sneezing...  honey, no more worrying, okay.  uhoh. what's wrong.  i think a snap just broke on my dress.  yeah. let me see.  no, no. it's all right.  i'll just get a safety pin.  it'll be fine. don't worry.  i'll be right back.  ready for your wine, sir.  uh, i think i'll wait for my wife.   and then what, gloria.   anything look tempting.  oh, mike, their specialty tonight is abalone steak.  you know how the kids love abalone.   you remember when peter went diving for abalone.  yes, and he cut his foot on some coral.  that's right. he did.  remember, it wasn't much at first, and then it turned out to be pretty nasty.  you know that happens sometime.  yeah, i suppose so.  oh, no. i think that pin's come loose.  i'll be right back.  listen, honey, while you're gone, i'll just get some change for the parking lot attendant.  the trouble with you, gloria, is it's impossible to believe a word you say.   good timing, huh.  uhhuh.  mike, i just carol, i just called ho...  called home...  you, too.  well, peter's foot and the abalone got to me.  mike, i'd feel a lot better if we could run by the house and check before going on to the show.  why don't we skip dinner and do that.  we can eat later.  uh, captain.  are you ready now, sir.  i'm afraid we've had a change in plans, and we can't stay.  that's perfectly all right, sir.  i'll bring you your check.  check.  but we didn't have anything.  there's the cover charge, madam.  and the state tax, of course.  but we didn't have anything to tax.  the tax is on the cover charge, sir.  you know, we really shouldn't be doing this.  why not.  because we said we trusted them.  the kids will never forgive us for checking on them.  yeah. maybe you're right.  honey, listen, i'm sure they're okay.  besides, they've got the chain on the door.  : mike...  i smell smoke.  oh, that's just the ditmeyers' barbecue.  well, maybe so, but couldn't we check just the same.  they're always having those barbecues.  it'll only take a minute.     marcia, did you hear something.  like what.  i'm not sure.  what was it.  jan, get off the phone.  i have to make an important call.  : are you all right.  yes. yes, sir.  i heard it twice.  thank you very much. goodbye.  the police are sending a patrol car right over.  he said there's one right in the neighborhood.  you would have been quieter breaking down the front door.  boy, you better be sure you heard something.   i think you're right.  it's the ditmeyers' barbecue.    : wait here.   mr. brady, what are you doing here.  what are you doing here.  man: what are you all doing here.  well, you see, officer, alice here is our housekeeper.  that's right, sergeant.  and you were fighting over who's going to vacuum those bushes tonight.  oh, no. this is our house.  we thought alice was a prowler.  she was supposed to be over at sam's doing the curtains.  i got worried about cindy.  the kids are sitting alone for the first time.  the line was busy.  i got to worrying about her cold.  mike: we skipped dinner, but didn't want to miss the show.  a friend of my husband's gave him the tickets.  all we wanted to do was... check.  carol: it's a simple explanation.  we smelled smoke in the neighbors' yard...  carol: right. the ditmeyers' over there...  they make little hearts happy and big hearts happy too because as part of a hearthealthy

 no, greg, you did the right thing.  well, i just checked.  cindy's sound asleep, and not a sign of a sniffle.  we kept a close eye on her, like we promised.  oh, hey, if you hurry, you'll still have time to catch the show.  exactly what i was thinking.  shall we, honey. great idea.  oh, goodbye, kids.  goodbye. goodbye.  we won't be late.  and don't worry. we have everything under control.  the
