i'll come right to the point.  when you moved in next door payne and i didn't realize that you had children.  as a matter of fact, we didn't.  matt just joined us today.  ..  an adopted child.  yes, an adopted child.  oh, well, be that as it may payne and i don't have children and we like to keep our home neat.  boys trample flowers, break windows and write on wallssometimes dreadful things.  you have nothing to worry about, mrs. payne.  well, i hope not.  our houses are rather close together.  kelly i understand that you're in, uh, show business.  i do a nightclub act.  well.  i suppose someone must.    matt, what's the matter.  : nothing.  does something hurt you.  no, i was just thinking about something.  well, about what.  about dwayne and steve and all the other kids at the home.  ..  there are lots of children in our neighborhood.  yeah, but we always used to go to sleep at the same time.  dwayne on that side and steve on that side.  you'll have lots of new friends soon.  i don't want new friends.  dwayne and steve are the best friends i ever had in my whole life.  ..  we can visit them.  can we, really.  yeah.  that's a promise.  thanks, mom.  thanks, dad.  that's okay, son.  go back to sleep now.  he finally fell asleep.  right, yeah.  i can hardly wait to tell ken about it.  okay, byebye.  tell me what.  that was carol brady.  i was telling her how lonesome matt was.  we came up with an absolutely terrific idea.  yeah, what is it.  it's really great.  i know it's great.  i know it's terrific.  only one thing i don't know: what is it.  ...  oh, sorry.  carol said the reason the brady kids are never lonesome is because there's always another kid around.  oh, i think i know.  what is it, adopt another kid.  right, right.  it should be easier this time.  we've been through that red tape with matt.  we filled out those forms and everything.  it will cost more to raise two kids than one, you know.  yeah, honey, we can manage.  oh, fantastic.  fantastic.  but i don't think we should do it right away.  well, when.  oh, not until tomorrow.  mr. and mrs. kelly.  hi, miss phillips. hi, miss phillips.  how's matthew.  he's just fine.  we left him with the bradys some neighbors of ours.  uh, sit down.  say, did i ever show you this paperweight that matt made for me.  i am ready for a hurricane.   he's quite a boy, matt.  yeah, he sure is.  do you have another like him.  ...  we thought it would be good if matthew had a brother.  well.  um, he keeps talking about two boys who seem to be special friends of his.  dwayne and steve.  they're both great boys.   dwayne and steve, yoohoo.  hey, they're calling us.  come on, let's go.  dwayne and steve, this is mr. and mrs. kelly.  hi. hi.  hello, dwayne.  hello, steve.  hi.  you're good friends of matt's, aren't you.  yeah, matt's a real nice guy.  he's our best friend.  miss phillips used to call us the three musketeers.  because we always played together.  i see.   i did too.  now, give it to me.  uh, excuse me.  a definite war is about to begin.  right.  matt got adopted yesterday.  he was real lucky.  most people like to adopt little babies.  it's harder for us big guys.  yeah.  well, you're both fine boys.  i'm sure you'll both be adopted soon by some nice families.  mr. kelly: that's right.  well, we didn't mean to interrupt your painting.  we'll be running along now.  bye.  bye. let's go.   we came right here to talk this over with you.  you'll be able to give us advice better than anybody.  mr. kelly: that dwayne is black and steve is oriental surprised us a little but what difference does that make.  mrs. kelly: a boy is a boy if he's white or black or yellow or blue.  i know it will present certain problems but everything in life presents certain problems, right.  .. that's for sure.  the biggest problem is trying to decide between dwayne and steve.  we started talking about adopting both of them.  we'll put three beds in the room, that's all.  raising three boys can't be much more difficult than raising two boys.  if anybody knows, you do.  ..  you adopted three boys.  you adopted three girls.  that's why we know exactly what you would do if you were in our place.  you'd adopt both dwayne and steve, right.  mrs. kelly: we've decided to follow your advice.  thanks for talking this over with us.  carol: i'm glad we could be of help.  may we leave matt here while we go make arrangements for the two boys.  of course. sure.  thanks again.  oh, good luck.  thk you.  byebye.  it's really nothing.   do you suppose we were like that.  i guess, probably.    oops, we have the fork on the left and knives and spoons on the right.  i forgot.  oh, well, you can't learn everything in a week.  hey, there's too many plates, mom.  uh, your dad's bringing home a couple of old friends today.  hello.  oh, hi, honey.  go see who he has with him.  matt.  dwayne. steve.   what are you guys doing here.  we're going to live here.  mr. kelly's adopting us, too.  we're going to be brothers.  brothers.  yeah.   you're back together againthe three musketeers.   hey, musketeers, anybody hungry.  boys: oh, boy. come on.    hey, how come you get that bed.  you guys

sorry, guys.  ..  all: no.  everything's fine, carol.  phillips waived the waiting period and the boys are with us now.  oh, cathy, i'm so glad.  they've been absolute angels.  i can hardly wait for monday when i take them to school to register.  what an assortment.   the kelly rainbow.   oh, hi.  kelly, i see you now have several children.  three altogether.  of various colors, one might say.  you just did.  mind you, i'm not a bigot.  i believe that blacks, yellows everybody has a place in our society.  payne and i even manage to be cordial to the shapiros on the next block.  that's various generous of you.  well, we try.  nevertheless, three small boys ..  especially the minorities.  congratulations, mrs. payne.  " i consider that remark uncalled for.  if nobody calls for it in 30 days it's all yours, baby.  ken, you're right.  that woman is absolutely impossible.  honey, you shouldn't have gone over there to try to reason with her.  she makes archie bunker sound like a liberal.  i'm thirsty, i'm going to get some milk.  you better not or you'll have an accident during the night.  what do you care if i have an accident.  you sleep right up there.  come on, you get a drink, too.  okay.  just be happy she isn't twins.  she could be living on both sides of us.  i just can't forget those terrible things she said about dwayne and stevie.  she's going to give us nothing but trouble because of those two little boys.  that's for sure.  if she could, she'd buy this house and kick us out of here.  she already told me she was going to try and keep me out of the p.t.a.  payne kick you out of the optimist's club and any other organizations.  mmhmm.  well, i hated to be rude to a lady, but on the other hand both:.. right.  i told her what i thought of her.  nobody's going to interfere with dwayne and steve if i can help it.  attagirl.  right.  payne we're going to make those boys happy.  did you write how much we like it here.  i wrote it.  did you write how much we hate to cause them trouble.  i wrote it.  ..  i wrote it. i wrote everything.  i'm just signing my name now.  okay, then i'll sign mine.  shh.   both: shh.  hey, where are you guys going.  away.  shh.  how come.  we're too much trouble.  kelly kicked out of here and she's going to get mrs. kelly kicked out of the p.t.a.  and mr. payne won't let dad become an optometrist.  if you guys are going, i'm going with you.  you're not causing any trouble.  they said dwayne and steve.  we're the three musketeers.  one for all and all for one.  hey.  hey.  who are you guys.  i'm matt.  i'm dwayne.  i'm steve.  we're brothers.  brothers.  since 5:00.  oh, you must be the kelly kids.  hey, what are you doing here.  we're running away.  and we didn't know where to go.  i was here before.  you've got so many kids i figured maybe nobody'd notice us.  hey, it's getting kind of late.  why don't you come in the house with me.  more hot chocolate.  yeah, i'd like some more.  boy, he drinks all the time.  so what, you've got nothing to worry about now.  you guys don't by any chance sleep in bunk beds, do you.  yeah.   where you guys heading.  oh, i don't know.  maybe out west.  we are out west.  maybe out east.  wherever you go, you better send an address.  kelly would like to keep in touch.  i know they're quite interested in knowing where you are.    thank you.  do you know how worried we were.  never do it again.  boys: no.  well, plenty, that's how much.  how'd do you find us.  that's not important.  what is important is for us to stick together.  ..  we don't care what mrs. payne said.  we care about you.  you're our family.  we want you boys to grow up with parents.  and we want to grow up with children.  we'd love that but we didn't want to cause any more trouble.  that's why dwayne and me left.  and i went with them because we're the three musketeers.  you're wrong about that. you're not the three musketeers.  we're not.  no, you're not.  weare the five musketeers.  right.  yeah.  ..  ..  brady but you three are definitely not greg, peter and bobby.   hi, alice.  hi.  matthew, dwayne and stevie.  hi, alice.  hi. hi.  hi, kids.  we're sorry we woke you.  we were just passing through.  passing through.  right, on our way home.  come on, boys.  boys: bye, alice.  we're going home.  get some sleep.  the boys get such a big kick out of visiting here.  well, that's what neighbors are for.  oh, by the way, we want to thank you for sending the kids this book.  i guess you knew the three musketeers would make a very big hit.  it wasn't hard to figure out.  how come you brought it back.  to show you what they've done with it.  what do you mean.  they said they had to fix it.   hey, that's great.      here's the story    of a lovely lady    who was bringing up    three very lovely girls    all of them hadhair of gold    like their mother    the youngest onein curls    it's the storyof a man named brady    who was busy withthree boys of his own    they were four menliving all together    yet they were all alone    till the one day when    the lady met this fellow    and they knew that it was    much more than a hunch    that this group must    somehow form a family    that's the way we all    became the brady bunch    the brady bunch    the brady bunch    that's the way we became      i'm sure you all remember jim mcdivitt one of the two astronauts on the second gemini flight which was the eighth manned space flight.  well, i'm your host, mario machado and the show isnews event and we're here to discuss the current rash of u.f.o. sightings.  our special guest now brigadier general jim mcdivitt not only was a former astronaut he also claims to have seen an unidentified flying object.  first, welcome here.  when was that, general.  it was during the flight ofgemini 4,mario in june of 1965.  general, let me lay it on the line.  ..  do you believe that life exists elsewhere in the universe.  yes, mario, i really do.  uh, i think it would be very naive and really superegotistical on our part to believe that we're the only form of life in all this vast, vast universe in which we live.  here you are.  thanks.  could you sign it "to my good friend, peter brady".  sure thing.  i'm his brother, bobby.  make me a good friend, too.  sure thing, bobby.  i can always use another good friend.  you sawwere there any people in it.  i'm not really sure.  i never got close enough to find out.  but there could have been, right.  yes, always possible.  that's my theory, too.  thanks, general.  keep up the good work.  i'll try, i'll try.  take it easy, boys.  wow, i'm not going to wash that hand for a month.  big dealyou wouldn't wash it, anyway.     hey, pete, wake up.  do you hear a weird noise.  yeah, you yapping.  no, for real. listen.   yeah, i do hear a weird noise.  sounds like it's coming from outside.   it's gone.  that couldn't have been an airplane.  not moving like that.  bobby, do you know what we just saw.  .  a real, live unidentified flying object. )
