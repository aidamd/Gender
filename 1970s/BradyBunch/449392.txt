economy size.  little girls are so funny.  jan was so worried she'd never have a boyfriend.  well, let's face it11 years old.  she's not getting any younger.  mom, have you or alice seen my math book.

different side.  hi, mom. hi, dad.  hi, honey.  how was your day.  just terrible.  the worst. really the worst.  i'm so mad i could... oh,am i mad.  something happen at school.  somethingdidn'thappen at school.  clark didn't even look at me.  i saw him at lunch, and i passed him in the hall five times.  maybe he had something else on his mind.  he sure didmarcia.  marcia.  yes, marcia.  it's all her fault.  what's marcia got to do with clark.  well, i'm not sure, but i think our blueeyed daughter has been smitten by the greeneyed monster.  : mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the fairest one of all.  hi. what's with you.  what i want to know is what's with you... and clark tyson.  who.  don't pretend you don't remember.  after what you did yesterday when clark and i were studying, and you came slinking in...  oh, him.  your little friend from school.  he's not mylittlefriend from school.  he's taller than i am, and he's the bestlooking boy in my class.  you came in there on purpose just to turn on your icky old charm.  jan, if boys don't find you attractive, don't blame it on me.  you busy.  yeah. what do you want.  i need some advice.  okay.  shoot.  it's about boys.  i thought you shrewd females knew all about us poor, dumb guys.  well, this is for a friend of mine.  see, she met this real cute guy, and everything was groovy.  until then, all of a sudden, he lost interest.  why would a guy do this to my friend.  just lose interest.  maybe she's using the wrong kind of toothpaste.  i'm serious, greg.  well, how should i know.  the guy probably found something about her he didn't like.  such as what.  maybe she's got a face that would scare snakes.  she has not.  is she too fat.  no.  too thin.  no.  well, then it's got to be her crummy face.  who is it.  just some unfortunate girl.  thanks, greg.  yuck.  it's my crummy face.  greg was right.  rotten freckles.   cinnamon cookies.  they're jan's favorites.  thought i'd make some to cheer her up.  well, i guess a shattered romance can be pretty rough at that age.  oh, yeah.  mom.  can i go to the store, please.  well, don't be long, dear.  dinner's almost ready.  who can eat.  i wish there was something we could do to make her feel better.  maybe we could give her some of her birthday presents in advance.  hey, better than thathow about a surprise birthday party.  wonderful.  a party's a sure cure for the blues.  with balloons and paper streamers and cake and ice cream.  the works.  now, this is a very important meeting.  highlevel, topsecret stuff.  jan isn't here yet.  that's the whole point.  we're planning her surprise birthday party for saturday night.  a surprise party.  neato.  what do we do.  we'll do anything.  just tell us.  cindy, you're in charge of putting candles on the birthday cake.  you know how many to put on.  sure. i can even count high enough to put candles on your cake.  that many candles would be against the fire laws.   marcia, you have the honor of baking the cake.  oh, great.  greg, you and peter will be in charge of the decorations.  who's in charge of the ice cream.  that's my department.  want to trade.  that would be like putting a mouse in charge of the cheese.  thank you.  something for you, young lady.  oh, i was just looking around.  do you have any kind of, um...  well... something to get rid of freckles.  freckles.  it's for a friend of mine.  for a friend of yours. hmm...  i suppose these freckles she hasthey're a real big problem.  they're ruining her life.  those ol' freckles.  well, is there anything i can... i mean, she can use.  you might suggest to your friend that a little lemon juice wouldn't hurt.  and stay out of the sun, too.  i sure will.  thank you.   we've got to hide these birthday presents someplace where jan won't look.  hey, how about under my bed.  sure.   yikes.  get under the bed.  : what's she doing with lemons.  i guess she wants sour skin.  peter: you should have seen the neat girl clark tyson and i walked home with.  her name's ginny wilmer.  talk about cool.  greg: yeah, i saw her.  she's not bad.  she's really neat.  all the guys in our class are flipped.  well, i only saw her from a distance.  peter: she's even better up close.  kind of crazy eyes.  lots of freckles.  boy, do they make her look out of sight.  there goes your last excuse.  it isn't the freckles. it's just dumb old you.   ]

invite him to her birthday party.  that way, she'd have a double surprise.  hey, you're right. that is an inspiration.  of course, we have to find george without letting jan know.  i'll round up the other kids and put them on his trail.  hi, mom.  hi, honey. how did it go.  what about george.  i couldn't find him.  there's no george in jan's class.  hi, dad.  hi, honey.  oh, hey, wait a minute.

deepens.  oh, yeah. how do you mean.  i covered this whole area.  there's no george glass in this part of town.  that's strange.  sorry.  you tried, greg.  mike, are you thinking the same thing i'm thinking.  mmhmm. there's no george glass, period.  exactly.  why. why this problem with boys.  she's bright and attractive.  i wish i knew.  we'd have to ask a boy.  what do you want to ask me about, mrs. brady.  thank you.  well, clark, we've been curious about something.  and, since you're in jan's class, we thought you might be able to tell us.  i'll try.  it's about jan.  how do the boys feel
