 fruity and honey nut.  yes..  that's not a cheerio.   no can we play again.  yeah. close those eyes.  mom, marcia's been locked in that bathroom for an hour.  we need one more bathroom or one less sister.  yeah. one less sister.  oh, be patient with her, boys.  you know she's in the throes of her first romance.  you mean she's in love. yech.  bobby, love isn't all "yech." well, who's the unfortunate fellow.  i think his name is... harvey klinger.  harvey klinger.  harvey klinger.  harvey klinger.  who's harvey klinger.  what's wrong with harvey klinger.  everything's wrong with harvey klinger.  he's an alltime, allamerican gradea creep.  besides being a jerk, a goof and a double dingbat.  greg, don't you think that's being just a little bit strong.  mom, those are his good points.  hey, you'll never guess what happened.  she's out of the bathroom.  it's about time.  now she's on the phone.  talking to harebrained harvey, no doubt.  nope, she's talking to her girlfriend, sally, who sits next to harvey.  and it sure sounds icky.  dinner's ready, kids.  alice, would you please call the others.  hey, dinner ready, alice.  just coming to get you, mr. brady.  she's still staring at the wall.  cindy, must we have these tenminute announcements.  i'd better go and get juliet.  i'll do that.  you'd better eat my pot roast while it's hot.  when it cools off, it loses something in the translation.  come on.  soup's on, honey.  everybody's waiting for you.  everyone except harvey klinger.  hmm.  he doesn't know i'm alive, alice.  oh, now, what makes you say that.  i didn't. he did.  told my girlfriend, sally.  maybe she misunderstood him.  no, alice.  have you ever been in love.  i mean, really, truly in love.  sure.  and it can hurt...  until the next time you're really, truly in love.  i'll never find the right man again.  sure, you will.  the problem is to find the right man that thinks you're the right woman.  what's the difference.  if harvey klinger doesn't know i exist...  i wish i didn't.  marcia hasn't got the sign of a cough, and she isn't lying on a chaise holding a faded lily, but you have definitely got a camille on your hands.   well, i suppose it hurts the same at any age.  there must be some way we can help her.  yeah, there is.  how.  well, by not butting in.  honey, look, she's going to get over it.  puppy love isn't lasting, and it certainly isn't fatal.  no, but, for a while, it can sure make you wish it was.  you're absolutely right.  i say we should try to help her.  yeah, and i say, "butt out." all right, but i'm going to do it under protest.  okay. now, mike, when you were harvey's age, what attracted you to girls.   well, um...  having something in common like... a hobby.  well, that sounds like a good idea.  what was your hobby.  girls.   i wonder what harvey klinger's hobby is.  carol: this one. don't peek.   a banded wooly bear moth.  right.  and, uh, ugh, this one.  yuck... a purple tiger beetle.  that one looks icky.  mmm. i'm with you.  are you sure you want to go through with this.  you asked me what harvey likes, and that's what havey likes: bugs.  bugs.  okay.  onward.  this one.  a 17year... clicida.  no, not clicidacicada.  cicada.  right.  and this one.  that's a watch.  right again.  and time for you to go to bed.  you don't know how much i appreciate this, mom.  oh, that's okay.  that's what mothers are for.  hey, how's everything in bug city.  it's heaven, dad.  simply heaven.  i take it everything went well, huh.  oh, and very educational, too.  well, do you know the difference between a male peach tree borer and a female peach tree borer.  no. i haven't the slightest idea.  lucky for you you're not a peach tree borer.  hey, thanks for the hobby idea anyway.  yeah, well, i did it under protest, and i still don't think we should meddle.  oh.  what's that.  oh, that's greg.  helping marcia's cause.  what's he doing out there.  collecting bugs.  mike: collecting bugs.  carol: mmhmm.  how did you get him to agree to do a thing like that.  well, i just explained to him marcia's problem, and the fact that, you know, she is his sister, and that it is his duty to help her...  how much you pay him.  only ten cents a bug.  is anybody sitting here.  hmm.  may i sit here.  mmm.  nice day, isn't it.  mmm.  well, of all thingsa lateralfemarata.  where. where.  right there.  it's an absolute perfect specimen.  you can have it if you like.  i already have one.  gee, thanks.  my name's harvey klinger.  i'm marcia brady.  you're the first girl i ever met who knew anything about bugs.  say, aren't we in the same english class.  i don't know.  i sit in front.  what's that you're reading.  the wonderful world of insects, by professor g.t. hardgrove.  that's my favorite book in the whole world.   fourth period bell.  yeah.  can i walk you to class.  okay.  mom. mom.  you'll never, never, never, never, never guess what happened to me.  well, i'll take a stab in the dark.  what happened.  harvey klinger walked me home.  no. oh, marcia, that's wonderful.  the bugs worked.  and that's not all.  he asked me to go steady with him.  i said yes, if you say yes.  can i, mom, please.  well, um...  i'll speak to your father about it.  oh,musca domestica, i love you.  what.  that's the common housefly.  go steady.  go steady.  steady there, mrs. brady.  oh, i wanted harvey klinger to like her, but going steady is something else.  i know what you mean.  not dive right in from the 20foot board.  oh, mr. brady warned me not to interfere.  you'll have to tell him.  if he hears it from marcia, it'll be much worse.  yeah, that's right.  i wouldn't worry too much.  he's a reasonable man.  he is, alice.  but as a favor, would you tell him on my day off.  they make little hearts happy and big hearts happy too because as part of a hearthealthy diet, those delicious oats in cheerioscan help lower cholesterol.  cheerios...  how can something so little...  help you do something so big.  goodbye, mom.  goodbye, honey.  goodbye, alice.  bye, mom.  bye, alice.  bye, sugarplum.  goodbye, mom.  bye, mom. bye, alice.  you didn't tell me, mrs. brady.  was mr. brady very upset about marcia going steady.  oh, not at all.  oh, good.  i, um... didn't tell him yet.  oh.  well, he worked late last night and, by the time he came to bed, i'd already gone to sleep.  i see.  but i'm going to tell him this morning.  maybe i'll tell him after dinner.  i'll fix his favorite dish.  chicken.  right, chicken.  i didn't mean the dish. i meant you.  all right, no more stalling.  i'll face the music.  i'll go tell him now.  want to come with me.  thanks just the same.  i'm no good at duets.  mike.  yeah.  oh, it can wait.  if you're too busy, i'll come back later.  honey, i'm just getting dressed for work.  i do that from time to time.  yeah.  what's on your mind.  mmm.  you're an openminded man, right.  : right.  and flexible...  oh, very.  i mean, you're not the type of man who would ever say, "i told you so." carol, just what are we talking about here.  well, that rare gift you have for being fair, impartial, unprejudiced.  you left out courteous, faithful and true.  yeah, those, too.  what do i get my merit badge for.  for being understanding when i tell you that marcia wants to go steady with harvey klinger.  would my striped tie look all right with this.  did you hear what i said, mike.  marcia wants to go steady with harvey klinger.  so what.  going steady, school dances, a movie, a soda.  doesn't mean a thing.  you don't think so.  no. honey, listen, going steady today isn't the same as when we were 13.  oh, i'm so glad you're not upset.  upset. fair, impartial, unprejudiced mike brady.  oh, i absolutely love you.  i really do.  you do, huh.  that's good to hear.  you know, after we're married a few years, i may ask you to go steady.  this is a very unique specimen ofdrosophila.  really the common fruit fly, but with the unique habit of living in vinegar.  gee, harvey.  gosh.  sickening. positively sickening.  hi, greg.  hi, mom.  are marcia and harvey still in the kitchen.  are they. yech.  this hairy one's called the snout beetle.  it's lovely.  so close to the weevil family, yet so different.  hi.  with its offset eyes and its manyjointed antennas.  gee, marcia, you really know your bugs.  what a sweet thing to say, harvey.  honest, mom, that harvey is buggier than his bugs.  you said it.  "do you know the hairy beetle has offset eyes." "why, naturally.  and a drosophila lives in vinegar, my dear." "oh, how thrilling, harvey." "gosh, marcia." come on, you two. scoot.  offset eyes.  what's so funny.  private joke.  okay.  how goes it, kids.  i think that's fascinating.  carpenter ants really nest in dead trees.  you'll have to take my word.  i couldn't bring a dead tree with me.  well, i'd never doubt your word, harvey.  this one's a queen.  no wings, you'll notice.  i noticed that.  she pulled them off herself.  though why. why.  one of the eternal mysteries of the insect world.  how about a piece of fruit, harvey.  some milk and cookies.  harvey, how about a bug sandwich.  you say something, mr. brady.  i thought that'd get you.  what are you doing up here.  you're supposed to be helping us.  yeah. dusting the living room.  and sweeping the kitchen and patio.  dust makes my eyes red, which is very unbecoming to a woman going steady.  oh, well, then just sweep.  it would ruin my feminine posture.  jan: you're only 13.  you're not old enough yet to have a "posture." what do you need false eyelashes for.  that one looks like a seesaw.  it makes me feel womanly, glamorous.  that's why women wear perfume and eye shadow and lipstick.  makes you attractive to a man. beautiful and exotic.  it does.  well, i might as well be beautiful and exotic.  me, too.  lovely, lovely.  isn't that just absolutely...  lovely.  my goodness.  just what do you think you're doing.  just girl talk, mom.  how do i smell.  like you need a long, hot bath.  and right now.  what about me, mom.  how do i look.  oh, cindy, i know your mouth is there someplace.  try some soap and water and see if you can find it, okay.  i was experimenting with the eyelashes, mom.  going steady is one thing, but wearing false eyelashes is out.  out.  a lot of girls my age wear makeup.  well, i'm sorry.  that's their mothers' problem, not mine.  now, off they come.  ouch.  like harvey says...  "parents just don't understand our generation." marcia, i understand it better than you think.  i've already lived through your generation.  but things have changed since you were my age.  only times have changed, sweetheart.  people haven't.  but they have.  you know what harvey says.  a girl my age is like a 20yearold used to be, and a boy of 14 is like 22.  a girl of 13 is like 20 and a boy of 14 is like 22.  that's what harvey said.  well, if harvey is 22 and marcia is 20, then that's the way they ought to be treated.  if that's what harvey says.   hi, mr. brady.  hi, harvey. good to see you.  come on in.  come on in. sit down.  make yourself at home.  marcia's running a little late for her date, but that's a woman for you, huh.  yes, sir. that's a woman for you.  what we men put up with, huh.  yes, sir. we men.  yeah.  you two doing the town tonight, huh.  kind of taking it easy tonightjust a soda.  mmhmm. mmhmm.  you know, harvey, i wasn't too sure about you and marcia going steady at first, but, as you say, she's like a woman of 20 used to be, and you're like a man of 22.  yes, sir.  harvey, what are your plans for the future.  the future.  mmhmm.  well, uh, next week, i'm going to get a new front tire for my bicycle.  no, no, harvey.  i mean for work or a home or... some kind of retirement plan.  well, uh, before i retire, i have to get out of junior high school.  oh, yeah.  hi, harvey. i'm ready.  swell. uh, let's go.  oh, listen, no need to rush, harvey.  um, marcia, i was just talking about you two.  what about me.  i was just saying that i think it's a big responsibility to be going steady, and i'm pleased that harvey here is taking it so seriously.  seriously.  carol: that's good to know.  before you know it, harvey, you'll be out of high school, out of college, going to work, and hearing those wedding bells.  wedding bells.  what wedding bells.  yours and harvey'sthe two of you.  hand in hand, forever.  me and harvey.  just like your father and i.  mmhmm.  we'd better get going, harvey.  yeah.  if you'll excuse us, sir.  oh, sure. of course, harvey.  listen, it's nice having this talk with you, okay.  that's okay.  yeah.  good night, mom.  good night, dad.  what was that all about.  look, marcia, i don't think i'm ready to be 22 yet.  that's not what i meant by going steady.  me neither.  maybe we could go steady just once a week.  yeah. that's steady enough.  still want that soda.  sure. but let's hurry and get right home.  kids our age need lots of sleep.  yoplait greek 100.  the proteinpacked need something filling, taste bud loving, deliciously fruity, grabandgo, take on the world with 100calories, snack.  yoplait greek 100. there arehundreds of reasons to snack on it.  a nascar driver...  a comedian...  and a professional golfer have in common.  we talked to our doctors about treatment with xarelto.  xarelto is proven to treat and help reduce the risk of dvt and pe blood clots.  xarelto has also been proven to reduce the risk of stroke in people with afib, not caused by a heart valve problem.  for people with afib currently well managed on warfarin, there is limited information on how xarelto and warfarin compare in reducing the risk of stroke.  i tried warfarin before, but the blood testing routine and dietary restrictions had me off my game.  not this time.  not with xarelto.  i'll have another arnold palmer.  make mine a kevin nealon.  really, brian.  hey, safety first.  like all blood thinners, don't stop taking xarelto without talking to your doctor, as this may increase your risk of a blood clot or stroke.  while taking, you may bruise more easily and it may take longer for bleeding to stop.  xarelto may increase your risk of bleeding if you take certain medicines.  xarelto can cause serious, and in rare cases, fatal bleeding.  get help right away for unexpected bleeding, unusual bruising, or tingling.  if you have had spinal anesthesia while on xarelto, watch for back pain or any nerve or muscle related signs or symptoms.  do not take xarelto if you have an artificial heart valve or abnormal bleeding.  tell your doctor before all planned medical or dental procedures.  before starting xarelto, tell your doctor about any kidney, liver, or bleeding problems.  xarelto has been prescribed more than 11 million times in the u.s.  and that number's growing.  like your guys' scores.  with xarelto there is no regular blood monitoring, and no known dietary restrictions.  treatment with xarelto was the right move for us.  ask your doctor about xarelto.  mmmm

" that's because no one liked you.  this is why when i was a kid, i had an imaginary mother.  i can't believe it.  buzz mueller just called. he's in town.  buzz mueller.  i haven't seen buzz in almost 40 years, since we were dating in high school.  i didn't think you dated anyone before charlie.  actually, it was while i dated charlie.  rose nylund, you were in a love triangle and never told us.  i didn't think you'd be interested.  why were you dating both buzz and charlie.  because i didn't know which one i liked better.  they were so different.  charlie liked to do all the typical teenage things.  at a drivein movie, he'd hide me in the trunk so we only had to pay admission for one, and after the movie, he'd let me out of the trunk and tell me all about it.  but i was looking for someone more exciting.  that's when buzz came along.  olaf's heppest cata musician. you know the type.  well, i almost married buzz. )
