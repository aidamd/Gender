" you've got to paint the lines straight.  cindy: is mine good.  looks fine, but make it look real.  wow, you sure are a bunch of busy little beavers.  hey, what's this.  that's the stock.  we put criminals in it.  they only get bread and water.  and splinters.  i borrowed it from school along with other props.  say, this looks like the real thing.  is this how it was in olden times.  exactly.  when you were a little girl.  bobby, your mother wasn't born then.  well, alice.  neither was i.  jan, did you wash your hands.  yeah, see. told you.  what's taking bobby so long.  i don't know. i

hold still, sweetheart.  i'm holding, mom.  mom, i tell you, that's the wrong costume.  well, dear, why don't you let me finish it before you reject it.  they didn't wear stuff like that in pilgrim daysonly black and white.  but it's a shame to dress the girls in black and white when you're ing color film.  hi, everyone.  hi, dear.  oh, carefulthe pins.  wow, don't want to get stuck.  that's one of the pilgrim costumesvery nice.  it's nice, but not for a pilgrim.  they only wore black and white.  that must have been the origin of "basic " yeah, and let's leave it that way.  yeah, well, i

then what do you need indians for.  dad.  bobby, the indians were friendly, at first.  they didn't start fighting until their land was taken away.  the pilgrims took away all the indians' land.  that's right.  at first, they didn't take much of it.  then how about not much of an attack.  there's no attack.  ..  you don't know they're friendly until they hold up the "friendly" sign.  then i duck out and change while the other pilgrims greet them.  that's it, great.  okay, places, everyone.  mom, over here.  you'll be with the butterup and down, churning it and, dad, you're chopping the
