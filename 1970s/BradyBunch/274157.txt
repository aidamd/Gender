shell. good.  well, now that i've got this great new personality why should i waste it on just the family.  you know, mike, i think peter's jokes are kind of cute but maybe the kids he invites to the party won't.  honey, kids usually like those kind of jokes.  besides, he's finally enthusiastic about something.  it's important.  well, i guess you're right.  who knows. maybe that's how bob hope started.  ha, ha, ha.  ha, ha, ha.   hey, listen, he's really killing them.  my son, the comedian.  yeah.  i guess you all heard that one.  well, how about this one.  this lady goes to the doctor and

some ball.  what's the matter.  we hear them laughing.  every time i start to tell a joke someone else tells the punch line.   what's the matter, peter.  nothing.  then why are you sitting by yourself.  you did that at jane's party last week.  i don't want to ruin everybody's fun.  i'm too dull.  you're not dull.  i think you're very nice.  you're just saying that.  i am not, and if you

dull guy.  you don't say.  sure, they hang around and try to convince you you're not.  i'm the first guy invited to three parties next week.  well, looks like dull is in this year.  why don't you change your personality, dear.  : if you say so, sweetheart.  : how about some pork chops and, uh, applesauce.  .. kiss.  : oh, the first time i've ever kissed humphrey bogart.     here's the story    of a lovely lady    who was bringing up    three very lovely girls    all of them hadhair of gold    like their mother    the youngest onein curls    it's the storyof a man named brady    who was busy withthree boys of his own    they were four menliving all together    yet they were all alone    till the one day when    the lady met this fellow    and they knew that it was    much more than a hunch    that this group must    somehow form a family    that's the way we all    became the brady bunch    the brady bunch    the brady bunch    that's the way we became      greg, can you help me.  you know all about cameras.  what's the matter.  well, the last picture i took was number seven.  i guess i turned it too hard because it went past eight.  the next number is nine.  so.  i don't want to miss a picture.  i spent a whole allowance on that film.  how do i get it back to eight.  you can't get it back to eight.   boy, some camera expert you are.  well, i might as well get it over with.  mom, i have something important i want to tell you.  what is it.  ..  i'm very hungry.  ..  well, that's it.  i'd say he has more on his mind than food.  i'd say you were right.  hi, dad.  hi, son.  what did your mother say.  i didn't tell her yet.  that was the first order of business after breakfast.  it slipped my mind.  rushing around, trying to get to school.  you could have told her after school.  it got kind of late.  ..  a little help.  yeah.  come on, we'll tell her together.  thanks, dad.  oh, hi, honey.  hi, greg.  hi, sweetheart.  hey, something smells good in the kitchen.  yeah, it's meat loaf.  oh.  yeah, sure smells good.  real good.  is something wrong.  no, no, honey, nothing's wrong.  ..  well, greg has something to tell you.  ..  no, tell her.  something is wrong.  i should have known before.  no, honey, believe me, nothing's wrong.  ..  in fact, it's kind of great.  so great, both of you are too chicken to tell me what it is.  well, mom, it has to do with ball.  what.  football.  i guess you don't know too much about football.  that's that game on tv you and your father watch where those great big guys try to kill each oth what about football.  uh, you see, i made the football team at school.  honey, the coach says he's a natural flanker back.  no son of mine is going to play football with those twoton monsters.  the coach wouldn't pick greg if he didn't think greg was up to it.  he won't take unnecessary chances with the boys.  tell her about the great things football does for you.  he'll learn the importance of teamwork and being part of a team.  yeah, teamwork.  learn how to win gracefully.  yeah, win gracefully.  lose with dignity.  .. what do you mean lose.  i'm sorry, greg, but football is out.  mom, a guy can get hurt right in his own home.  like falling in a bathtub.  but he doesn't have two other guys in the bathtub with him trying to knock him down.  carol, i think you're being overly concerned about this.  thousands of kids play football every week.  carol:..  hmm.  maybe you're right.  does it really mean so much to you, greg.  yeah, it does, mom.  well, okay.  but it doesn't mean that i'm still not going to worry.   thanks, mom.  thanks, dad.  you're welcome.  oh, come on, honey.  don't worry, he can take care of himself.  why didn't he go out for something like the debating team.  because you'd be afraid he'd sprain his toe.  now, that isn't nice, mike.   i thought it tasted like lemon.  no, it tasted more like lime to me.  how do you like that.  the best cake i ever created and i go and forget my own secret recipe.  well, i'll keep thinking, alice.  me, too.  thanks, girls.  i got it, alice.  this time, i really got it.  whatever it is, don't give it to the rest of the kids. )
