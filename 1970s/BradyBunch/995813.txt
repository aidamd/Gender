better off.  well, i certainly can't argue with that.   honey, if i hadn't spent the whole morning playing ball with the boys, you'd get all my sympathy.  do you realize that in the past month, i've

now, that's the trouble with women.  you should only go to the refrigerator once and take out everything you need, see.  wait a minute, i'll show you.  string beans, lettuce, mayonnaise for the salad and... eggs.  dad.  that was funny, daddy.  well...  if an accident does occur...  you clean it up immediately.  i'll do it.  it's my accident.  i'll clean it up.  mr. brady...  no, i'll do it.  but, mr. brady...  mom uses a mop for that.  so does alice.  i'll use a towel.  marcia, you know, the proper way to do that is with an electric mixer.  i've never used a mixer.  oh, it's simple.  wait a minute.  this thing was invented for the sole reason of making life easier for women, see.  now...  we just put the bowl under here...  turn it on.  oh.  first, you have to make sure it's plugged in.
