window.  cindy: it was dancing in the tree.  it'll be all right.  i didn't see a thing, dad.  it was the biggest ghost you ever saw.  i think it was probably just the moonlight shining in the trees.  no, dad, we heard it in the attic first.  well, there's one way to find out: go up in the attic and take a look.  no. not me.  i'll wait till morning.  kids, how many times have i told you: there's no such thing as a ghost.  what's... what's happening, dad.  nothing. the girls had a little scare.  are they okay.  yes. they're fine.  go on back to bed.  whoo. whoo.  we scared them.  yeah. did you hear them scream.   shh. shh.  now, i wonder who could have left this window open.   hey, look.   i think we found our ghost.  so what did you find.  nothingthe creaking you heard was the rocking chair.  but who was in it.  nobody.  how do you know.  well, because the seat was all covered with dust.  ghosts don't leave any marks when they sit down.  everybody knows that.  okay, girls, there is nothing in the attic and there's nothing in the trees outside so let's all go back to sleep, huh.  rightand dream of nice things.  good night.  good night, girls.  see you in the morning.  jan: good night.   you know, i think our ghosts are right in there.  mmhmm. all three of them.  i bet we don't see any more ghosts tonight.  what makes you so sure.  i have a feeling they're all asleep.  in the attic.  no. across the hallgreg, peter and bobby.  i bet they rigged up this whole thing.  you're right.  they're always playing tricks on us.  those monsters.  are you sure.  tomorrow, we'll do a little detective work and i bet we can prove this whole thing.  that's right. we don't have any ghosts in our house.  we have three rats.  jan, you look in the closet.  cindy, check under the beds.  and i'll take the dresser drawers.  okay.  what are we looking for.  i'm not sure, but i bet we find it.  hey, i found something.  what's a slide projector doing under greg's bed.  it's usually in the family room.  hey, there's a slide in it.  look at this.  it's somebody with a sheet over his head.  cindy: yeah, it's one of the boys under a sheet.  sothat'show they did it.  they aimed the projector out of the window onto the tree.  that's our ghostpeter with a sheet.  but how do you explain the creaking in the attic.  it still could have been the rocking chair.  the boys could have moved it from down here with this rope.  how.  well, let's say this is the rocking chair and they did this.  it would rock.  and when they finished, the rope would disappear.  that's really smart.  what.  dirty, but smart.  dirty's right.  we've got to get back at them.  yeah, give them a dose of their own medicine.  excuse me, folks.  i hate to disturb the artist at work but you left the dinner table before dessert.  no, thanks, alice. not for me.  yeah, well, i'll have mine. mmhmm.  boy, that's coming along just fine...  yeah. thanks.  whoever it is.  mike, would you hold your mouth still,

starvenot the model.  i'll give you a bite.  no, thank you.  greg: here it is.   are you still scared, cindy.  boy, i don't think i want to go to sleep tonight.  peter: how come.  because of that ghost.  i think we ought to lock our windows and doors.  alice: i think you girls are scaring yourselves worse than that nonexistent ghost did.  no such thing as ghosts. right, fellows.  boys: right.
