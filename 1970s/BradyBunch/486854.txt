of it, no.  i got just the thing for you back here.  she's really something special so i thought i'd better look special and smell special, too.  now, listen, peter.  if you want to impress her you use just a little of this.  how come just a little.  well, like it says in the tv commercial if you use a lot you'll have to fight off women with a whip and a chair.  well, since i just met her maybe i should start slow and build.  yeah, that's good thinking.  hey, that smells good.  kerry.  small world.  hi.  don't you recognize me.  i'm jan's brother pete.  oh, i'm sorry.  you must have been the boy who called last night.  yeah.  i've met so many new kids in school i can't keep them straight.  that's okay.    oh... oh, yeah.  aftershave lotion.  you like it, huh.  do you shave.  oh, yeah, all

to her.  now, wait a minute.  don't get uptight about it, listen.  do you know that when i was your age i had the same problem with a girl.  you did.  yes, i didpolly ledbetter.  polly ledbetter.  that was her name.  when we got close, i got a knot in my tongue i could have won a merit badge with.  what'd you do about it.  i just figured if i couldn't say what i wanted to i could always write it.  so i wrote her a letter.  a letter, huh.  uhhuh, that way you can take your time and think about what you'll say.  that's a great idea.  thanks, dad.  sure.  what are you doing.  trying to write a letter or start a paper drive.  it's a tough letter to write, alice.  i don't want it to sound corny.  well, want to try it out on me.  okay.  "dear kerry..." yeah.  that's it.  that's where i get stuck.  oh.  oh, yeah, well...  that first line is always the toughest.  i just don't know what to say.  why don't you try something poetic like "how do i love thee.  let me count the ways." greatgive it to me again, slow.  "how do i love thee." jan. hi.  what did she say.  who.  kerry hathaway.  about what.  about me.  peter, we've got a communication gap.  i wrote kerry a letter and i slipped it into her locker.  i want to know what she said about it.  oh, was it a gooey love letter.  yeah, did she mention it.  she mentioned it.  well, what'd she say.  she said it was beautifully written.  yeah.  super poetic and fantastic.  what else did she say.  that the dumbdumb who wrote it forgot to sign his name.  oh, no.  how could i be so stupid.  you must practice a lot.  it's the perfect plan and you're the perfect guy.  no way, pete. no way.  where'd you get this weird idea.  from this copy ofcyrano de bergerac.  marcia put me on to it.  it's great.  it's about this guy with a big nose and he's in love with this girl named roxanne.  peter, i know the story.  he's shy, see.  so he hides in some bushes and has this other guy say to her...  i said i know the story.  all i'm asking you to do is hide in the bushes like cyrano did and you feed me the right words.  when it comes to smooth talking the girls everybody says you're the greatest.  yeah. everybody says that.  everybody.  they call you "old silver tongue." they do.  you're a legend in your own time.  how about that.  i really need help from an expert like you.  well, okay, we'll try it.  if cyrano could do it so can "old silver tongue."  : that's the one.  : that's it.  okay.  hide back here.  you're sure i look okay.  peter, you look fine.  my hair.  does my hair look okay.  after 20 minutes with mom's hairdryer you couldn't look any better.  you're sure you thought up some real poetic stuff.  my stuff is better than cyrano's.  remember your first line.  yeah.  well, here goes.      hello, lovely one.  peter. is that you.  yeah,
