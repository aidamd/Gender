your allowance for this week.  well, i was thinking more like an advance on next week's.  what happened to this week's.  well, i saw the chance for a really great business deal, so i leant everything i had to janfour dollars and 49 cents...  at 20% interest.  what does jan need all that money for.  she didn't say.  well, what do you need the money for.  well, i was invited to lucy winter's birthday party, too.  so i guess i better get her a present.  well, that's probably what jan wanted the money for.  how much do you need.  mm... 49 cents.  49 cents. why exactly 49 cents.  well, i figure that's how much she spent on my birthday present, so i don't want to embarrass her by getting her something too good.  well, that's very considerate, peter.  here, you owe me a penny.  got it all ready.  there.  thanks.  goodbye, peter.  are you looking for someone, dear.  oh, no, ma'am.  i'm looking for a wig.  you mean for yourself.  yes, ma'am.  i think your own hair is nice.  i love it.  i don't know why you'd want to change it.  i think you'd probably know why if you had two blonde sisters at home.  oh, i see the problem.  we want a complete change, do we.  yes, ma'am, that's what we want.  well, now, what style wig did you have in mind.  oh, i don't know.  something crazykind of like the style you're wearing.  : it's my own hair.  oh, i'm sorry.  not half as sorry as i am.  well, now let's see what we've got here.  there's "early rust," "pompeii pumice," "lunar dust..." here's... no.  cindy, what are you looking for.  hair ribbons.  i can't go to over to ginny's

bathroom.   whoever it is, i'm in here.  cindy: jan, let me in.  i have to get my hair ribbons.  come back later.  come on, jan, open up.  you let us in.  grab her.  jan, what happened.  the top of your head turned black.  don't be silly, it's a wig.  where'd you get that.  oh, i bought it this morning.  what do you think.  jan, i think it looks awful.  who asked for your opinion.  oh, i've always liked this dress on jan.   you, too, huh.  mmhmm...   yeah, i agree.  well, i hope we got it right this time.   honey, have you seen those blueprints i brought home.  alice, have you seen mr. brady's blueprints.   she says they're upstairs in the bedroom.  how could you tell what she said.  oh, very simple.  : women.  honey, listen, if you're going upstairs, would you send jan down.  i want her to try this on again.  mike: jan.   yes, dad.  your mother wants you.  do you mean now.  yes.  right now.  yes. that's what i said, right now.  you mean this very minute, now.  this very minute, now.  it's my hairi can't do a thing with it.  hey, when's peter coming back.  i don't know. he went to buy a present for lucy.  i got something i'd better tell him.  what.  guess who's going

toloveseeing her.  we'd better warn him when he gets back.  hey, wait a minute.  what would happen if we didn't tell him margie wipple was going to be there.  then he wouldn't know till he got to the party.  and spend the whole time with margie chasing after himget it.  that'd be a dirty trick to play on him.  uhhuh.  uhhuh.  you wanted to see me, mom.  jan, i thought you washed your hair yesterday.  oh, i did, but, uh, it needed it again.  well, come on over here.  i want to check the length on this.  couldn't we do it later.  jan, honey, if you're going to wear this to the party,

everyone else.  i want to be jan brady.  but, honey, jan brady has blond hair.  nobody noticesthatjan brady, but they'll sure notice this jan brady.  jan, a person doesn't make himself different just by putting on a wig.  it's what's inside that counts, not the color of your hair.  well, then, if the color of my hair doesn't matter, why can't i be a brunette.  well, honey...  please can i wear it.
