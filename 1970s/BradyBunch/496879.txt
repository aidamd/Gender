" ugh. that smells terrible, alice.  i don't think you're going to get mrs. brady to try it.  it may not smell like gardenia but the main thing is it's a cure for laryngitis.  aah, that needs more vinegar.  what else have you got in that witches' brew.  oh, oil of camphor, tar, pepper, mustard powdermy grandmother's secret remedy.  well, none of the other medicines has worked.  in fact, i'm planning to exchange that tape recorder.  well, there's no need in reminding her she can't sing now.  if this works, she might get her voice back by christmas.  yeah, i hope you're right.  the best thing you can do is to pour that down the drain and hope it doesn't wreck the plumbing.  brady, many people have scoffed at this remedy.  greg: hi, dad.  we going to go shopping soon.  before we go shopping i'm going to fix lunch.  not for me.  i just decided to go on a diet.  brady, this is my grandmother's secret remedy for curing laryngitis.  let me wrap it around your neck.  i know it doesn't smell very nice but you'll get used to it in a little while.  : alice, no.  but the other medicines haven't worked.  now, please give it a chance.  look, i'll show you it's not so bad to wear.   see. i can hardly smell it at all.  will you wear it.  you won't be sorry, mrs. brady.  you'll be cured in 24 hours.  : 24 hours.  24 hours, unless you break out in a rash and then you ought to take it off.  you're wearing grandma's secret remedy.  let's hope it does the job.  we're going to go downtown and finish the shopping.  i'll round up the kids.  who knows, honey.  it might just work, you know.  does the smell bother you.  .. no, it's not too bad.   we better get goingwe won't be too long.  uh, no.  oh, it looks like we got here during the rush hour.  now, you be a nice little girl and you'll get that puppy for christmas.  i can wait by myself, daddy.  well, i did want to exchange this present.  you sure you don't mind waiting alone.  daddy, i'm six years old.  i keep forgetting.  now, i'll be right back and you wait right here.  okay.  okay.   hi, i'm cindy.  what's your name.  i hate girls.  a basketball and a bb gun and a fourspeed bike with hand brakes and a dart game, and a baseball mittlefty..  all right, sonny, i'll do all i can for you.  now, you just run along and be a good boy.  i'm only half finished.  i know, but i have to feed my reindeer and besides there are other children waiting.  i'll read this later.  you might forget.  oh, i'll never forget you, sonny.  merry christmas.  ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  you're next, little girl.  well, my sakes.  what's your name.  cindy brady.  my, but you are a pretty little girl.  what toy would you like to have santa bring you.  oh, i don't want any toys.  no toys.  well, you must want something for christmas.  i doi want my mommy to get her voice back.  your mommy's voice back.  mommy's got "larrygitis" real bad.  well, that is a shame.  and she has to sing at church on christmas.  ..  oh, please, santa.  it's all i want for christmas.  well, you certainly are a sweet, unselfish little girl.  i'm sure your mommy will get her voice back.  oh, thank you, santa.   daddy, daddy.  what are you so excited about, sweetie, huh.  santa's going to give mommy her voice back for christmas.  he's what.  he promised mommy can sing on christmas morning.  oh, honey, how could he do that.  he's not a doctor.  he's better than a doctor.  he's santa claus.  why would you make such a promise to a little girl.  listen, this is christmas, mister  and i'm santa claus.  you know, maybe it's okay to promise material things like toys and dolls and bicycles but not voices.  how will cindy feel tomorrow when her mother can't even say "merry christmas".  i'm sorry, but that little kid is hard to resist.  when she looks at you with those big baby blues you want to giv her erything.  not things you can't deliver.  look, she believes in you, you know.  ..  wanted to make her happy.  that's great for now.  what's going to make her happy christmas day.  i can hardly wait for christmas, mommy.  : me, too.  and wait till you see what santa's bringing you.  santa's bringing me something.  .. but it's a secret, so i can't tell you what it is.  all right, i'll tell.  you're going to get your voice back on christmas.  cindy, can i see you for a moment.  sure, daddy.  be right back, mommy.  i told mommy what santa's bringing her.   daddy.  ..  did you bring me out here to watch you walk.  no, sweetheart.  i have something to say to you but i'm not sure how to say it.  you're going to scold me.  no, of course not.  i didn't think so.  you always knew how to do that.  cindy, i don't want you to build your hopes too high that your mother will get her voice back by christmas.  oh, she will.  santa said so.  well, maybe you misunderstood him.  now, he didn't exactly promise, did he.  oh, yes, daddy, he did.  ..  and he's santa claus.   cindy, i don't want you to expect a miracle.  oh, i don't expect a miracle.  i just expect mommy to sing good.  now, where would be a good place to hide the boys' presents.  do we have to hide them.  it's a surprise.  they'll never expect to be getting presents from us.  how about in the closet.  no, that's the first place they'll look when they start snooping.  why would they snoop.  well,wesnoop, don't we.  all right, now, just make sure the girls don't catch you hiding these.  if they catch me should i eat the present.  .  he's been watching too many of those spy programs.  mrs. brady.  find one of yours.  what did it sound like.  i started thinking about mom losing her voice on christmas.  yeah, just when she's supposed to sing her solo.  it's a bum deal.  i thought sure she'd have her voice back by now.  bobby: me, too.  keep it down, would you.  you'll wake everybody up.  jan: who can sleep.  some christmas.  it's no fun this year.  aha. i caught you in the act.  sneaking down, trying to guess what the presents are.  nobody feels much like guessing presents.  you know whatithinki think we ought to postpone christmas till mom can talk again.  greg: i'm for that.  bobby: me, too.  let's skip christmas this year.  okay, it's unanimouswe'll cancel christmas.  take the tree down get the presents back to the store.  i'll throw the turkey away.  of course, it might disappoint your mother a little.  she's had one tough break already.  she and your dad were looking forward to us all having a wonderful first christmas together.  well, why worry about howtheyfeel.  we don't want to disappoint them.  of course not.  well, that's exactly what you'd be doing.  it wasyour idea, marcia.  i only meant it because mom can't sing tomorrow.  don't throw the turkey awayit's got my favorite dressing.  don't worry, honey, i won't.  i just wanted you all to realize you didn't really mean what you were saying.  you sure scared me.  okay, everybody off to bed now.  come on, back you go.  ..  off, vixen.  on, comet, on, cupid, and donner and blitzen.  we were just going back to bed.  good night, kids.  mr. brady, i didn't know you were there.  alice, i heard part of what you said to the kids.   ..  ..  ..  sing.  : sing.  at this hour.  i can't even talk.  i just did.  oh, mike.  i'm not dreaming.  i'm awake. i can talk.  sing, honey, sing.   o come, all ye faithf )
