thing.  that's all.  can i try it.  sure, be my guest.  see, it's not so tough.  .. there goes what's left of my ego.  here i've been trying to do this for hours ..  alice. i did it.  brady, i think you've found the secret to golfdon't look.  wow, am i beat.  you'll probably be practicing in your sleep.  what are you working so hard for.  because i'm fighting an uphill battle.  what do you mean.  jennifer nichols has got greg twisted around her finger so tight he wouldn't sneeze without her permission.  do you think he'd vote for his girlfriend against his own sister.  jan, you don't know anything about life.   hi, honey, i'm home.  hi.  .. what happened to your hand.  blisters.  well, what have you been doing, chopping wood.  mike, i've got two surprises for you: the first, i got these blisters while i was trying to learn how to play golf.  .. honey, that's sweet of you.  that's very sweet.  what's the second surprise.  my five iron.  i did it while i was practicing.  i'm sorry.  ..  well, this will come in handy if i ever want to shoot around a tree.  i got it.  what happened. what's the matter.  i figured out my problem with marcia.  for that you have to wake us up.  we were fast asleep.  i've been worried about nothing.  i'm the chairman of that committee.  when the three judges pick the winner i won't even have to vote.  i'm off the hook.  greg: that was fine.

please.  we have one vote for jennifer nichols.  one vote for marcia brady.  and we have one vote for pat conway.  looks like we have a threeway tie.  in the event of a threeway tie, the chairman decides it.  that's me.  baloney, i bet greg voted for marcia.  and i say he voted for jennifer.  you'll see when he gets here.  why should he vote for jennifer instead of his own sister.  peter, you don't know anything about life.  hey, dad, is mom getting any better.  great, as long as she keeps her eyes closed.  ..  honey, wait a minute you've got to relax your hips a little bit here.  who cares if i'm good or bad.  the lessons are terrific.  hi.  both: hi.  carol: is the contest over.  yeah.  what happened.  it was a threeway tie.  i had to cast the deciding vote, of all the luck.  jennifer.  marcia.  no, i voted for pat.  pat.  pat conway.  i really thought she was the best.  now marcia and jennifer are both going to hate me.  here it comes.  hi, mom, hi, dad.  hi, greg.  you're still talking to me.  greg, i take back what i said.  you've got a lot more character than i gave you credit for.  you mean that.  yeah.  you know, i would have liked to have won but pat was the best.  she deserved to win.  you know, it doesn't sound like she hates you.  say, if marcia isn't mad maybe jennifer won't be mad either.   after all, jennifer's crazy about me.   jennifer: hello.  hi, jennifergreggy.  ..   hello.  hello.  .. hung up on me.  ..  what.  ..  this may sound ridiculous but it's just possible that jennifer was trying to use me to win that cheerleading contest.  well, i guess that's possible.  yeah, that's it.  you can take it from me, dad because if there's one thing i know about, it's women.   hi.  greg and mike: hi.  well, did you have a good game.  best day i ever had on the golf course.  dad, every saturday from now on, we've got a date.  ..  he must have had a great score.  never played worse.  why the enthusiasm.  because of something he saw in the pro shop.  a new set of golf clubs.  a new golf bag.  golf pro's daughter.  .. oh, yeah.  come on, i'll fix you something cold to drink.  yep, if it's one thing he knows about, it's women.    here's the story    of a lovely lady    who was bringing up    three very lovely girls    all of them hadhair of gold    like their mother    the youngest one in curls    it's the storyof a man named brady    who was busy withthree boys of his own    they were four menliving all together    yet they were all alone    till the one day when    the lady met this fellow    and they knew that it was    much more than a hunch    that this group    must somehow form a family    that's the way we all    became the brady bunch    the brady bunch    the brady bunch    that's the way we became      good afternoon, young lady.  may i help you.  we were in here last week and ordered an anniversary gift for our parentsa silver platter.  .. oh, yes, the brady children.  i came in the next day and ordered the engraving.  oh, of course.  .. jan brady.  right. is it ready.  it just came in this morning.  i'll get it for you.  i'm sure you'll find it exactly the way you ordered it.  oh, that's beautiful.  "mom and dad, happy anniversary.  all our love, greg, marcia, peter, jan, bobby " i'm glad you could get all our names on it.  it wasn't easy.  one more brother or sister and we'd have had to continue on the back.  i'll get your bill.  oh, but we've already paid for the platter.  this bill is for the engraving.  i told you there'd be an extra charge.  oh, yes, you did. i'm sorry.  okay, here's 50, 60, 70, 85 cents.  this bill is for $56.23.  well, you said the engraving was only going to be 85 cents.  85 cents a letter.  don't you remember.  i guess i wasn't listening very well.  what am i going to do.  i don't have the money and my parents' anniversary is next saturday.  well, i really don't know what to do about this.  i don't, either, but until then can you hold on to the platter for me.  what else can i do.  unless i find another couple who has an anniversary and six kids named greg, marcia, peter, jan, bobby and cindy.  i'm really very sorry.  not half as sorry as i am.  this whole thing is my fault. )
