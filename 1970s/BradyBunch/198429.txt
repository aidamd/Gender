in gesundheits.  her symptoms disappeared.  ..  .. an allergy.  maybe she's allergic to something.  right, an allergy will make you sneeze and wheeze.  pollen, dust, maybe some kind of food.  when did she start sneezing.  this morning at breakfast.  hey, i used flour to make the pancakes and yesterday when i made that cake she was sneezing then.  as a matter of fact, a couple of days ago when we were making cookies, remember.  ..  i'm glad we found it out before she grew up and married a baker.  maybe it's the roses or geraniums or something.  it is pollen season.  it's the flour, mrs. brady.  let's take some up and test her.  alice, you don't mind if i check with the doctor, do you.  oh, no, ma'am.  he's entitled to his opinion, too.  nothing.  nope, none of those things make me sneeze.  it's the flour, mrs. bradyi'm positive.  okay, alice, we'll try the flour.  get ready with your gesundheit.  now, just a little sniff, jan.  no use punishing yourself.   just smells like flour.  it doesn't bother you.  no, not at all.  i don't understand that.     don't laugh.  this stuff is dynamite.  it doesn't bother me.  can i get up now, mother.  no, honey.  the doctor's sure you've got an allergy and he wants me to keep checking different things.  do i have to stay in bed.  no, you can go and get a shot, if you'd rather.  i'll stay in bed.  maybe jan's allergic to dust.  well, it can't be dust.  there's as much dust upstairs as there is downstairs.  thank you.  i'm sorry, alice.  i meant that it's all very well dusted.  oh.  i had a funny thought.  maybe she's allergic to a person.  oh, alice.  it happens.  i read about a woman that was allergic to her husband.  i read about that.  they had to get a divorce.  she's not allergic to us because we were both with her.  she never sneezed once.  maybe it's her new pillow.  oh, no. it doesn't have any feathers in it.  she couldn't be allergic to her sisters because you would have known.  maybe it's one of the boys or mr. brady.  oh, alice, really.  think about it, mrs. brady.  she hasn't sneezed once since they left.  ..  mike: honey.  i'm home.  brady we can check it out fast enough.  shh, alice, it's just too farfetched.  hi, darling.  .. honey.   god bless you.  mike: why are you staring.  haven't you ever seen anyone sneeze.  have you been sneezing all day.  first sneeze in a week.  how's jan feeling.  oh, much better.  ..   darling, why don't go see her.  she's dying to play checkers with you.  oh, really.  i better warn her.  as a boy, i was known as the checker champ.  well, watch out.  she's pretty good.  all right, tell me when lunch is ready.  we will.  doesn't that just tear your heart out.  he's so cheerful.  he has no idea what he's walking into.  alice, we don't know that it's mr. brady.  we don't know what it is.  you're right.  let's just wait until we find out.  you mean, just stand here and wait.  you're not suggesting that we go upstairs and eavesdrop.  hi, princess.  hi, daddy.   gesundheit.  how are you feeling.  i'm all stuffed up.  aw, that's too bad.  let's see, you got a fever.  no, mommy took my temperature.   mike: %4ice says you haven't been sneezing as much.  jan: now it started up again.   i hear you want to play me a game of checkers.  not right now.  i'm feeling worse.  you mean, since i came in.  yeahespecially since you sat down.    you poor kid.  you want me to read to you.  you settle back and relax a little bit.  close your eyes.  we can try it.    mrs. brady, we got to get him out of there.  ..  mike, would you come out here please.  sure, honey.  soup's on.  not exactly.  the fat's in the fire, you might say.  : alice, shh.  i'll read to you later.  here.  hi, honey, what's up.  ..  i don't quite know how to tell you this.  jan's allergic to you.  thank you, alice.  what's this all about.  you heard jan sneezing just now.  well, she didn't sneeze once while you were at the office.  it's one of those rare things.  now, that's silly.  well, that's what i thought, too.  but have you heard her sneeze since you left the room.  : no.  how are you feeling now, jan.  much better, daddy.  it was funny.  after you left the room, i started feeling better.  good.  i'm glad to hear it.  i'll see you after lunch.  well.  yep.  oh, mike.  now, honey.  why don't you two look at the bright side.  would you mind telling us just what that is.  ..  maybe you can get her a gas mask.   what was that.  i said, maybe you could get her a gas mask.  no, shh.   oh, that's music.  she's singing our song.   did you sneeze, jan.  yes.  tiger, please get down.  go away.  does it bother you with tiger near you.  oh, yes, it's terrible.  oh, i just realized.  let me get him out of here.  come on, katchoo king.  there, now, how's that.  oh, better.  does it bother you when i sit here.  not at all.  oh, what a relief.  ..  never mind.  it's tiger.  tiger. what's he doing.  it's his hairinvisible little particles.  that's what makes you sneeze.  i was afraid we'd have to get rid of daddy, ..  oh, mike, what will do about tiger.  well, i don't know.  the boys have raised him from a pup.  they'll be heartbroken.  i'm sorry, daddy.  it isn't your fault, sweetheart.  maybe it's not tiger after all.  alice.  alice, would you bring tiger back.  oh, darling, we're sure it's tiger.  maybe it isn't.  you sure you want him.  yes.  come on, tiger.  come here, tiger.  come on, tiger.  come on, come on, baby.  oh, no.   hi, gang.  hi, dad. hi, dad.  time out, fellows.  let's have a talk.  come on, tigerthis concerns you, too.  you look pretty serious, dad.  well, i'm afraid it is pretty serious, son.  mother kept jan home from school today because she thought she had a cold.  yeah, we wondered what happened to her.  how is she.  mike: fine.  it turned out jan didn't have a cold.  .  what a phonybaloney.  she wasn't pretending and it wasn't phony.  jan has an allergy.  an allerwhat.  allergythat's something that makes you feel miserable when you get anywhere near it.  i have an allergy, tooarithmetic.  peter, i'm talking about coughing and sneezing and eyes tearing.  now, there's something around the house that's doing all of these terrible things to jan.  greg: what's the problem.  whatever it is, let's just get rid of it.  even if it's tiger.  .  jan's allergic to tiger, and i'm afraid, boys that they cannot live together in the same house.  oh, dad.  that's terrible.  where's jan going to live.  jan will live with us, bobby.  maybe tiger can live with gram and grandpa.  i don't want tiger to go away.  tiger's a dog, son.  jan's your sister.  well, just keep tiger away from jan.  yeah, yeah.  boys, it's impossible in the same house.  isn't thereanythingwe can do.  sorry, fellows, jan's allergy gets worse and worse with tiger around.  i'm afraid he'll have to go.  did you get it.  right here.  there you go, tiger.  boy, this is the first time he's eaten a bone in our room.  yeah, it's kind of like a special occasion.  he's going to know something's wrong.  dog's can't figure out things like thatnot even tiger.  peter: he sure likes that bone.  yeah, i don't even want to break the bad news to him now.  it'll spoil his appetite.  well, i guess we got to do it.  ..  tiger.  tiger, i'm talking to you.  he ain't listening.  i bet he's got a feeling in his bonesi mean his own, not the one he's chewing.  listen, fellow, i got some terrible news.  would you leave that bone alone for a minute.  we should have given it to him after we said goodbye.  he wouldn't have wanted it then.  tiger, leave that bone alone for a minute, will you, tiger.  tiger.  that crummy bone is messing up everything.  tell him goodbye anyway.  yeah, let him eat it.  ..  as much as we love you, we got to give you away.  it's killing us, but there's nothing we can do about it.  you tell him, peter.  ..  you know we don't want to give you away.  tell him we'll miss him.  and we're going to miss you something awful.  tiger.  .  aw, he doesn't even care about us.  all he wants is that bone.  maybe he doesn't want us to know how he really feels.  ..  ..  oh, tiger.   and whenever tiger comes around me i sneeze and i sneeze and i can hardly breathe.  i don't want to get rid of him.  neither do i, but dad says his hair makes me sneeze.  hey, i know what we can do.  let's give him a good bath.  then his hair won't make you sneeze anymore.  hey, that's a good idea.  come on, cindy.  jan, you stay here or you'll sneeze.  okay.  don't forget behind his ears.  okay.   tiger.  boy, i'm going to miss tiger.  darn that jan anyway.  aw, she can't help it.  it's her dumb nose.  hey, i've got an idea.  people get heart transplantsmaybe jan can get a nose transplant.  that's crazy.  sure, where are we going to get an extra nose.  you guys are both such dumbheads i don't even know how we can be brothers.  there's only one thing to do.  peter: come on.  lift his rear end up, peter.  ..  what's wrong with him.  i've never seen him so afraid of water.  afraid or not, he's got to have a good bath.  it's our only hope for keeping him.  come on, tiger.  there.  good night, fellows.  good night, peter.  good night.  good night, bobby.  good night.  good night.  good night, dad.  good night, greg.  no talking, right to sleep.  bobby: dad.  if tiger doesn't make jan sneeze tomorrow will we still have to give him away.  no, of course not, bobby.  but don't depend on that.  i'm afraid that would take a miracle.  maybe there'll be a miracle.  oh, i hope so.  good night.  alice.  alice.  alice.  the kids are asleep.  ready for action.  soap, scrub brush, water.  i didn't say anything to the boysi didn't want to get their hopes up.  tiger needs a bath anyway.  i'd better get back before i'm missed.  come here, tiger.  what's the matter with you, tiger.  you usually enjoy a bath.  and, believe me, this is going to be a good one.  come on, tiger.  : you've been a member of this family for a long time.  you're a good dog and i don't want to lose you.  ..  but you're going to have a bath like you never had before.  that a boy.  you're going to like it a whole lot.  what's the matter,
