should play the part, that's all.  oh, why.  i didn't even try out for that part.  but the important thing is, marcia, that miss goodwin thinks you're the best one for it.  and i know why.  because you're the chairman of the play committee.  look, marcia, i volunteered to be the chairman because i wanted your school to present a good play.  i didn't want to help you get a good part.  marcia, miss goodwin isn't going to miscast the leading role in the play, just to please your mother.  then whywouldshe give me the part.  juliet's supposed to be beautiful and noble and i'm not anything like that.  marcia, that's nonsense.  you're a beautiful girl and, besides, you're a very good actress.  youhaveto say that.  you're my mother.   i say it and i'm not your mother.  come on.  you look beautiful and noble to me.  the trouble isyou don't think you are.  that's right.  it's your belief in yourself that counts, you know.  you are what you think you are.  you mean if ithink i'm beautiful and noble, then i will be beautiful and noble.  that's right, if you believe it, everybody else will believe it, too.  carol: think about it, marcia.  you can give your answer to miss goodwin in the morning.  okay.  i just don't get it.  i mean, marcia is really a very groovy girl.  you know she's groovy, iknow she's groovy, butshedoesn't know she's groovy.  it's weird you can't see yourself as others see you.  i know one way that might open her eyes.  what.  a few words from your mouth to her ear.  alice: now, if you tell her what you think, she might begin to believe it herself.  marcia, can we have a little help.  we're having trouble with our lines for the play.  sure. i don'ow qui how to say it.  should i say, "whogoes there." or "whogoesthere." or "who goesthere." see what i mean.  just say it plain, "who goes there." hey, that's it.  oh, gee, thanks, marcia.  you're a terrific actress.  let's practice before we forget how she said it.  yeah, okay. hark.  who goes there.  is that right. yeah.  oh, gee, thanks.  you're aterrificactress.  "terrific actress".  you got a minute, marcia.  sure. what do you want.  do you know a guy by the name of, uh, lloyd leeds.  no. i don't think so.  well, he sure knows you.  he does.  yeah. he's in my english class.  he wants to meet you.  me. why.  well, obviously he thinks you're a really groovy chick.  a high school boy really thinks i'm groovy.  a lot of people honest.  ieven think you're groovy...  for a sister, that is.  thanks, greg.   greg: come on, marcia, don't play it so cool.  you know you're something else.  jan: you're aterrificactress.  bobby: you sure look pretty, marcia.  mike: you look beautiful and noble to me.  carol: you're a beautiful girl.  good morning.  oh, good morning, honey.  it's abeautifulday, isn't it.  lovely.  mom, i've been doing a lot of thinking since last night.  and.  well, i never thou but everybody else seems to think i am.  well, youare.  right. "a rose by any other name..." still costs ten bucks a dozen.  i think i can do it.  i'm going to be juliet.  oh, marcia, i'm so glad, and your father's gonna be so happy.  you know, he said, "you are what you think you are." so, from now on, i'm beautiful and noble.  i'm juliet.  wow... what was that.  thatwas the power of positive thinking.  hark.  who goes there.  well, what do you think.  not bad, i guess.  i think we should do it meaner.  yeah, let's do it again, only meaner.  hark.  who goes there.  'tis i, your father.  i bring secret documents to the brady house.  how'd we sound, dad.  were we fierce enough.  gosh, i thought for sure i was a goner there.  where's your mama. she's in the kitchen.  okay, troops, carry on the good work.  hark. who goes there.  harold: i'll watch her place of stand...  hi, honey. shh. shh.  i'm home from work early, but we don't have to keep it a secret.  good, good, good.  why are we whispering.  because marcia and harold axelrod are rehearsing their lines.  who's harold axelrod.  romeo.  oh, he is.  harold: my lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand to smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.  saints have hands that pilgrims hands do touch, and palm to palm...  romeo wears glasses.  thus from my lips, by thine my sin is purged.  it says you're supposed to kiss juliet.  uh...  i've, i've got to go now, marcia, but thanks a lot. you were super.  parting is such sweet sorrow )
