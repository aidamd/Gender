and genes.  oh, that's what that was all about.  and you told me that when you're born, the genes have already figured out what you're gonna look like when you grow up.  jan, what a person looks like is influenced by a lot of thingsnot just genes.  but can you give me a positive guarantee that i won't end up looking like aunt jenny.   i think we're being raided.  thanks for the escort, sonny.  you

husband, mike.  how do you do, aunt jenny.  what kind of a howdoyoudo is that.  this is a howdoyoudo. ha.  oh, mercy.  jan wrote me she has five brothers and sisters.  how long have you two been married, anyway.  three years.  three years.  crazy, headstrong kids.  and, last but not least, aunt jenny, this is bobby.  aw. how are you, darling.  hi, aunt jenny.  my goodness, aren't you beautiful.  well, that just leaves my lookalike.  where's jan.  oh, well, she's probably up in her room.  i'll see if i can find her.  okay.  gather 'round, kids.  i've got some presents for you.  marcia: that wasn't necessary, aunt jenny.  bobby: but it's nice. i'm with you.  don't look a gift aunt in the mouth.  i'm going to be in istanbul this christmas, so better early than never.   now, let's see what i've got.  wow.  it's autographed by wilt chamberlain.  do you know him.  i've known him since he was no higher than that.   now, let's see...  you dig magic, peter.  yeah, i love it.  okay, come on.  put these on me.  okay. they belonged to harry houdini.  really.  harry and i played the same vaudeville circuit.  i did a tap dance and a snappypatter routine.  okay, okay.  now concentrate.  okay.  hold my hands.  now, one...  two...  kalamazoo.  wow.  how did you do that.  i'll tell you lar.  now let's see what we've got here.   this is for you, love.  what is it.  it's a shofar.  you only blow it on rosh hashanah.    there you go.  what's written on it.  it's hebrew.  that'sl'shanah tovah, which means "happy new year." golda meir gave it to me.  well, here's your lookalike, aunt jenny.   well, if that doesn't blow a person's mind.  hello, soul sister.  hello, aunt jenny.  who says time marches on.  it just rolled back 40 years for me.  oh, wait a minute. wait.  i've got something for you.  here you are.  a little something pietro knocked out for me while i was having lunch ay.  oh. well, what's it supposed to be.  it's a portrait of me.   and i'm afraid it looks like me.  well, that certainly is a valuable gift for a young girl, aunt jenny.  oh, darling, i've got dozens of these cluttering up my walls at home.  : oh, uh, thank you, aunt you're welcome.  aunt jenny, we'd like to explain about jan.  you see, well, she's a little shier than the rest of the kids.  isn't she, mike.  oh, yeah, that's, that's all it is.  balderdash.  i got some bad vibrations in there.  now, that child doesn't dig me and i'd like to know why.  quit beating around the bush, 'cause i'm an old bushwhacker.  okay, i guess we do owe you the truth.  um...  well, aunt jenny, it all started when jan received your photograph in the mail.  the groovy thing about a sari is, you don't have to wear a girdle with it.  indira gandhi wears them all the time.  now, this...  this is for outback country in australia.  it's great for chasing kangaroos.   hmm... um...  jan, why don't we rap a little, hmm.  i didn't ask you up here just to be my ladyinwaiting.  i, uh... i wanted you to know that i know what's bugging you.  oh.  and i can't say that i blame you.  did my parents say something to you.  yes. oh...  but i had to drag it out of them.  i'm so embarrassed, aunt jenny.  don't be embarrassed, love.  i agree with you.  i'd rather look like raquel welch myself.  of course, i could have been beautiful if i wanted to.  you could.  oh, plastic surgery does wonders with noses and chins.  they even can put in curves where there's nothing but straight highway.  why didn't you do it.  oh, just never had the time.  besides, there are lots of pretty faces around, but how often do you see a puss like this.  whoops.  aunt jenny, where does the word "sukiyaki" come from.  japanese farmers used to roast meat over a fire at the end of a rake.  soyakimeans "to roast," andsukiis a rake.  well, sukiyaki certainly looks better on a menu than roasted rake.  hey, how am i doing with these.  thinner, thinner.  i want to be able to read a newspaper through it.  carol: where'd you get this recipe.  from one of emperor hirohito's chefs.  i ran into him at the ginza one afternoon.  i swapped him a recipe of madame khrushchev's for borscht.   i'll get it.  hello. yes, she is.  just a minute.  it's long distance for you, aunt jenny.  it's your secretary.  oh, will you take a message, honey.  oh.  would you spell that, please.  yeah, i certainly will. bye.  aunt jenny, i hate to be the one to break the news, but, uh, you now own a llama.  oh, that's nice.  carol: a llama..  yeah, the humane society gave it to you in appreciation for the help you gave in your fundraising drive.  hey, the dessert looks groovy.  now, aunt jenny, what are you going to do with a llama.  oh, no problem.  it can graze in the backyard with the zebra.   now i shall pass thechanuya or "honorable tea." everybody take a sip.  in japan, a sip like that would be an insult to the host.  let's hear it, honey.    jenny: ah... very good.  thatthe host will dig.    i'll get it.   hello.  uh... yes. just a minute.  aunt jenny, it's your secretary.  i can't be interrupted in the middle of a tea ceremony.  will you take the message, hon.  um, uh... she would like me to take the message.     yes.  t.  i'll tell her.   well, aunt jenny, you've been invited to a birthday party on ari's yacht.  is he kidding.  i'm not canceling my peace corps assignment in bolivia for any birthday party.  i'll cable jackie, though.  she's a real trip.  bobby: boy, i never ate with chopsticks.  cindy: it's easy. watch.   cindy: mmm...  carol: pretty good.  mike: it's looking good.  carol: oh, boy.   this is the easiest way, kids.  haven't dropped a grain of rice in... 20 years.   you must travel around the world a lot, aunt jenny.  ah, traveling is the spice of life.   i will never forget the time i was in bangkok.  i went to this little nightclub and who was playing the saxophone but the king himself.  great jazz buff, the king.  why, i was pretty good on the trumpet myself before my lip went.  so i sat in on a jam session with him.  i had such a time.  before i knew it, we were back in the palace, and i was teaching the king how to blow "charge."  dadadadadada.   charge.    i'll get it.  hello.  oh, just a minute.  aunt jenny, guess who.  shall i take a message.  please, honey.  okay.  hello. yes, i'll take a message.  uhhuh... uhhuh.  carol: oh, i certainly will tell her.  thank you. byebye.  aunt jenny, guess what.  a dozen longstemmed roses have just been delivered to your house, along with a marriage proposal.   that's that goofy lester again.  who's lester.  a united states senator.  a senator.  are you going to marry him.  nah. i get lots of proposals.  well, why don't you accept one of them.  oh, i guess i'm too young to settle down yet.  say, isn't anybody gonna eat my bean curd cakes.   i'm gonna stop this myself.  hello.  yes, it is.  now, look, hazel, why don't you knock it off.  oh... i plumb forgot.  yeah, yeah, don't worry.  don't worry. i'll make it.   well, kids, i'm sorry to not eat and run.  i've got to catch the 11:00 plane for paris.  paris. what.  a dinner at the american embassy for georges...  pompidou.  it's a bore, but you know how sensitive those french are if you turn them down.  oh, do you have to go.  i'm afraid so, sweetie.  well, i wish you could stay.  now, that's nice to hear.  i've really got to go, but i'll be back.  good.  i'll get your bags.  yeah, let me help.   i think aunt jenny's the most wonderful woman i ever met, and i'm going to grow up to look just like her.  honey, like i told you, genes are funny things.  there's a good chance you might not.  but there's a good chance i might.   ugh.  does your carpet ever feel rough and dirty.  don't avoid it. resolve it.  our new formula not only
