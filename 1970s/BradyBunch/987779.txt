" i take back what i said about your generation gap.  "dear libby, we have a terrible problem in my family.  "i have three children "and three additional children from a recent marriage.  "i had no idea three new children "could cause so much trouble.  "should i continue pretending to love them "and wait until they wreck my marriage " " what's so important about that.  well, don't you see, bobby.  three children and three new children.  that letter's about us.  we don't know anybody named harry hopeless.  " it could be anybody.  anybody who just happens to have three kids and then marries someone with three kids.  what's the matter.  i don't hear anything.  what's the matter with that.  six kids and no noisethat'swhat's the matter with that.  i've never heard such a loud silence.  maybe they all went to bed.  what about those trips to the kitchen to stave off starvation until morning.  cries in the night for water.  somehow, going to bed turns every kid into a dehydrated camel.  do you think we should check on them.  no. marcia and greg said they would.  what did "dear libby" say.  "dear 'harried and hopeless' "give it a try a little while longer.  " and that's good.  'cause that'll give us a chance to do something.  like what.  like behave ourselves.  i mean,really behave ourselves.  act nice and do our homework.  yeah, and keep our rooms picked up and help around the house and go to bed without being told.  don't fight with each other be polite and wash our hands and faces and comb our hair.  nobody'll recognize us.  we've got to do it.  for mom and dad.  boy, keeping them married sure is going to be hard work.  then they washed the windows after they came home without being told.  now they're cleaning up the garage.  they even weeded the garden.  maybe we ought to take their temperatures.   hey, i was watching that.  it's time for the ball game.  big deal. it's an important game.  missing a dumb game won't hurt you.  nobody but a dumb girl would say that.  if i'm dumb, you're superdumb.  if you're so smart, how come you're a girl.  what's the matter.  ..  there's an important game ..  would you knock it off.  we're supposed to be on our best behavior.  what's wrong in here.  nothing.  i thought i heard an argument.  greg: oh, ththat was on tv.  .. telecasting a peace conference.  there, i won.  you cheated.  i did not.  besides, you didn't see me.  i did, too.  you're a sore loser.  you're a sore winner.  cindy, bobby, be quiet.  but he cheated.  only once.  stop it, both of you.  ..  any trouble in here.  oh, no, everything's fine.  fine.  fine.  that's more like it.  what are you doing here.  well, i couldn't sleep.  that's a crazy sleeping pill.  if i wake up in the middle of the night at least i'll know why.  sorry i woke you.  oh, you didn't.  i couldn't sleep, either.  fix you one.  why don't i just have half of that one.  okay. i'll pour the milk.  what's on your mind, dear.  what else. the kids.  what have they done wrong.  nothing. absolutely nothing.  i know.  ..  i get the feeling i'm in the wrong house.  my girls never went through a phase like this before.  did the boys.  no. something is drastically wrong.  is this a top secret meeting.  .. come on in.  sorry we woke you.  oh, you didn't. i couldn't sleep.  there's a lot of that going around.  make you a sandwich.  i'll make it. you skimp.  if this is an open meeting i'd like to introduce a subject for discussion.  mike: feel free.  what's the matter with the kids.  we wish we knew.  they say anything to you.  not a peep.  but something's bugging them.  i think i'll just have to ask them.  would you do it tomorrow.  if there's anything i can't stand it's a perfect kid.  andsixof them. yecch.  i'll drink to that. yecch.  yecch.  hole and check for clogged pipes.  if that's not it, we dig by the septic tank and check for leaks.  if it's not there, we dig up the leech fields 'till we find the problem.  this 60 year old tree might have to go.  average repair cost: six thousand dollars.  monthly maintenancewith ridx.  about 6 dollars.   ridx uses natural bacteria and enzymes to break down waste.  use ridx monthly to help keep your septic system operating efficiently between pumpings.  for a moneysaving coupon, visit ridx.com.  hi.  hi, alice.  whwhat are you doing.  trying to find out what you're doing.  just raking some leaves.  you ask a foolish question, you get a foolish answer.  can we have a little talk.  well, ii really got to get this done.  ah, hmm.  hi, there.  hi.  can we have a little talk.  well, i'm kind of busy.  why are you trimming the lawn.  because it's here.  why do people climb mountains.  well, so far today i'm batting a thousand.  come on. why don't you kids level with me.  what's going on.  greg, what's going on.  we're gardening. that's what's going on.  okay, that's enough of the small talk.  come on, you two. sit down over here.  come on.  keeping your room spotless washing behind your ears eating everything on your platethat's bad enough.  but doing chores around the house without being asked is too much.  you six dogooders are driving me right up the wall.  either you tell me what's going on around here or i'll tell all the kids at school the way you're behaving.  alice, you wouldn't.  wouldn't i.  i think of every kid under 15 i can find.  and for the last time, tell me what's behind all this.  well, it's on account of mom and dad.  this problem involves your mother and father.  you haven't discussed it with them yet.  you two are pretty unfair to your folks.  raking the leaves an the lawn won't help but talking things over with them might.  maybe she's right.  let's tell them.  okay. you tell mom, and i'll tell dad.  come on.  now, say, i'm not the prying type so i won't to ask you what the problem is.  but if you want any practice i'm a very good listener.  practice makes perfect.  and you think this letter is about us.  well, how many families are there with three old children and three new children.  i don't know, but i'm glad you finally decided to show me the letter.  "dear libby".  well, yeah.  the lady that gives advice in the newspaper.  and you thought this letter is about us.  well, sure, dad. what else could we think.  don't you know there are any number of families with children from previous marriages.  but not with three kids apiece.  but i thought we were all getting along so well.  weare.  how could you think i would write such a letter.  mom, we didn't say you wrote it.  i wouldn't try to solve a problem " dad, the letter didn't say "harried and hopeless" was a man.  you look terrible.  i have a right to.  let me get you a cup of coffee.  thanks.  i take it you had that talk with the kids.  oh, yes.  maybe i'd better have a cup of coffee, too.  fire away. i'm ready.  well, you know dear libby's column.  oh, yeah. i never miss it.  you missed this one.  read the second letter.   hey, how about that.  she has three kids, and he has three kids.  .. like...  exactly.  ..  they thought if they behaved themselves "harried and hopeless" would stay married.  crazy kids.  you've got to admit there are quite a few coincidences between the family in the letter and ours.  about 110%.  right.  ..  brady a lot longer than i have.  ..  don't be silly.  mr. brady would never do a thing like that.  i didn't think so.  he wouldn't write a letter like that in a million years.  oh, alice, you don't know how much i appreciate this.  of course you're right.  you bet i am.  you don't work for a man all those years and not know what kind of a man he is.  mr. brady write that letter.  ha.  thank you, alice.  ..  you know that column in the paper called "dear libby".  yeah, i've heard of it.  yeah.  read that second letter.  that's yesterday's paper.  i got another copy.  hmm.  interesting.  you think it applies to us.  "us".  "harried and hopeless" has three children and married somebody with three children.  three and three.  i'd have to say that's pretty close.  yep. that's what i'd have to say, all right.  alice, you think carol could have written that letter.  mrs. brady.  brady wouldn't write a letter like that in a million years.  a billion years.  why, i guess not.  i'm surprised you could have fudged such a thing.  ..  yes, that's it.  men don't understand women.   what are you doing.  .. i was just wondering if, uh, these chairs would look better facing the fireplace.  oh. well, let's see.  mike.  hmm.  i really couldn't blame you if you had written that letter.  what letter.  " oh, that letter.  well, let's see.  how do you like the chairs like this.  the tables got to go the other way.  oh, yeah.  no, i couldn't blame you if you'd written it either.  i'd certainly understand if you had.  so would i.  i guess the end table has to go over there.  after all, it can't be easy for one to adjust to a whole new family.  no, well, not for some people.  ..  " spouse.  yeah, you'd think so.  in fact, i think it would be a good idea if they talk the whole thing over right now.  ..  if he has anything to say.  " you know something.  what.  i hate the room this way.  so do i.  mike.  oh, hi, honey.  ..  mmm.  we've always been honest with each other and it's silly to beat around the bush about something that might be very important.  yeah, yeah.  so, here goes.  " i'm perfectly happy with my three new sons and my wonderful new husband.  oh.   i didn't write that letter either and i adore my wife and my three new daughters.  ..  oh, what a relief.  now, how are we going to convince the kids.  well, they're watching a television show now.  as soon as it's over, we'll talk to them.  oh, good.    should me and kitty get worried now, alice.  nah. the sheriff would be along any second.   don't get up, alice. i'll get it.  i'll get it, dear.  let's race for it.  mr. and mrs. brady.  yes. yes.  you don't know me.  i'm elizabeth carter.  " i write a column.  you certainly do.  dear libby ..  .. come in.  look, the fact is, i never make calls to the homes of people who write to me.  but this is such an usual case, i felt that it was justified.  oh, we're very glad to have you here.  recently i printed a letter in my column written by someone who signed it "harried " since then i'd received seven letters from the same address all begging me to review the name and address of the writer.  it seems the original letter was causing a great deal of confusion in this similar household.  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  oh, and there's one more.  " you'll all be happy to know that the original letter from "harried and hopeless" came from kingsford, illinois 2,000 miles from here.  kids: yay.  oh, thank god.    i sure am glad we're not harry hopeless.   imagine all the kids writing dear libby.  alice, too.  obviously, that letter wasn't written by either one of us.  i don't suppose you thought for a minute iwas harry hopeless.  me. are you kidding.  know you wouldn't do a thing like that.  oh.  well, maybe i did write "dear libby" like the kids did but i never would have mailed it.  i didn't mail mine either.     here's the storyof a lovely lady    who was bringing upthree very lovely girls    all of them hadhair of gold    like their mother    the youngest onein curls    it's the storyof a man named brady    who was busy wiboys of his own    they were four menliving all together    yet they wereall alone    till the one day when    the lady met this fellow    and they knew that it was    much more than a hunch    that this group    must somehow form a family    that's the way they all    became the brady bunch    the brady bunch    the brady bunch    that's the way they became      i got it. i got it.  mary ditmeyer thought she'd win, but she didn't.  i got it.  cindy, be careful.  i got it.  what'd she get.  something mary ditmeyer didn't.  i hope it isn't mumps or chicken pox.  cindy, what'd you get.  oh, mommy, the fairy princess.  you got it.  the school playyou got the lead.  oh, cindy, i'm so pleased.  hi, there.  how are my girls.  oh, it's daddy.  you know what. you know what.  what.  i'm the fairy princess and i get to fly and marry a prince and everything.  terrific. that's great, punkin.  and i'm going to get the most applause 'cause i got the most family.  oh, you su.& do.   )
