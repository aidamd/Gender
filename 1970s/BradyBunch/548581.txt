they're better.  well...  oh, but i don't think they go with this bag.  let me see...  no, i think the straw one would go better, don't you.  well...  you're absolutely right.  hmm...  oh, but then i'll have to change my belt.  no, i think i'll just use this one, huh.  oh, hi.  hey, hi, alice.  where's mrs. brady.  there's a big sale on downtown.  what else would get her out of the house at this hour.  hey, did you enjoy your day off.  well, i took my aunt to the dentist, and then to the hospital to visit her neighbor.  then we went home and played mahjongg until 00, and then we went to bed.  it may not have been exciting but, on the other hand, it sure was dull.  you didn't miss anything exciting around here either.  see you later, alice.  bye, mr. brady.  what's up, fellows.  dad.  gee, dad, where are you going so early.  yeah, it's awful early.  i have a meeting.  what are you looking for.  looking for. us.  were we looking for something.  look, if it's private and you'd rather not talk about it, say, "dad, there is something we'd rather not talk about." all: dad, there's something we'd rather not talk about.  okay.  wait a minute, dad.  the truth is, we're looking for myron.  myron.  my mouse.  what would he be doing in here.  that's what we're trying to figure out.  yeah, he got away.  why are you looking for myron in the house.  we only wanted to save him from guenevere, the neighbor's cat.  we planned to take him out this morning.  honest.  we wouldn't wake you up in the night to ask you.  wasn't that nice of us.  okay, okay, i guess i get the picture.  where was myron when you last saw him.  in his cage in our room when we went back to sleep.  the cage is still there...  but myron isn't.  you better find myron before your mother gets home, and that's an order.  i hope we can, dad.  you better.  i got to go.  greg: so long.  peter: yeah.   we've searched upstairs and we've searched downstairs.  the attic.  sometimes mice go up there.  that's where i'd go if i were a mouse.  okay, let's look.      what's the matter.  what happened, alice.  oh, it's nothing.  i was getting a clean spot up here on the ceiling, and i almost slipped.  we've got to keep things tidy around here.  you better be careful.  zapit exterminator company.  this is the brady residence.  you did a termite inspection for us a while back, and now we've got another problem: mice.  do you suppose you could have somebody come out here in the next hour.  we've got a household full of children and women that are scared to death of miceparticularly the one that's talking to you.  oh, thank you. good.  yes, i'll be waiting...  sitting right up here.  well, that's it, ma'am.  that's all you have to dojust squirt under the house.  this is powerful stuff.  he's got to be someplace.  but, gee, if he's not in the house or in the attic...  maybe he's under it.  yeah, under it.  my compliments to the zapit exterminator company.  you sure came fast.  we know how you ladies feel about these things.  bye, now.  bye, boys.  hey, how about some milk.  alice.  what was that exterminator doing here.  i just thought i'd have him spray.  you never know what's under a house.  under a house.  well, now, don't get upset.  it's nothing terriblejust mice.  mice.  well, mouse...  but i'm sure he had friends.  what did he look like.  if you insist on the repulsive details, he was white, about that long, and about that... yech.  myron. myron.  myron.  myron.  he was my science project.  his name was myron.  his name was myron.  i'm a murderess.  greg, i think you're going to be mad at me for what i'm going to say, but it will make you very happy.  what do you mean.  myron wasn't exterminated.  he's in a hamper upstairs in our room.  he is.  who put him up there.  i did.  come on.  i'll show you.  oh, boy. let's go get him.  i took him out of his cage in your room last night just to play a joke.  okay, okay, let's see myron.  okay, he's right here where i...  all i see is a big hole.  me, too.  oh, no... he must have gnawed his way out.  well, i haven't seen such sad faces since the last day of summer vacation.  what's the matter.  myron's gone.  what happened.  he's been exterminated.  rubbed out.  oh, greg, i'm sorry.  when did it happen.  it doesn't matter now.   even tiger's sad about it.  i'm really sorry.   hello, alice.  hello, mrs. brady.  myron.  what happened.  well, i did it to him.  i had no idea he was greg's science project, and i called the exterminator.  i saw that little pink nose twitching at me, and i panicked.  oh, no.  oh, yes.  i heard about myron.  oh, mom...  it's all my fault.  i was playing one of those dumb jokes.  that's how myron got away, and now...  oh, honey.  i'll never do it again.  i'll never play another joke as long as i live.  oh, well, we know you didn't mean it.  shh.  hi.  we're in mourning.  yeah, greg told me.   what's the matter with tiger.   something's bothering him, all right.   well, we all miss myron, but it's hard to believe tiger's this upset.  tiger was scared of myron.   )
