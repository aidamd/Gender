 just bear in mind that those were the last words of general custer.  now, let's see.  i've already invited jenny wilton, my best friend, and paula tardy from my english class.  now, who else.  what do you do at a slumber party.  well, you play games, and you talk about boys.  and you talk about boys, and you play games.  what are the games about.  boys.  boys.. who likes boys.  hey, i got it.  oh, boy, have i got an idea.  are we gonna have fun at that slumber party.  you've got to be kidding.  i'm not going around any of those girls.  now, listen to me, you guys.  now, listen.  we're going to pull tricks on them. get it.  tricks.  yeah, you know, scare them. jokes.  yeah. yeah.  now, we ought to be able to think of some really great stuff.  like rubber spiders.  that's a good start.  a scary mask, spooky noisemakers.  and one of those plastic skeletons.  yeah, yeah, that's good.  hey, wait a minute. wait a minute.  i got it, oh, boy, is this beautiful..  what.. what..  itching powder in the sleeping bags.  yeah. yeah.  well, i know the boys aired these out, mike, but they still seem a little dusty to me.  yeah, well, i got them to do it this morning.  i guess they didn't have too much enthusiasm for the job.  well, maybe we ought to hang them up and beat them.  the sleeping bags or the boys.  oh, mike... well, look, i think i better go check the food for the party.  hey, is all that just for the girls.  whew, i thought we were starting a supply depot for the eighth army.  greg: hi, mom and dad.  say, listen, gregory, your mother's not too happy with the job you guys did on the sleeping bags.  yeah, i think they need just a little more freshening up.  it's not going to take too much time. all...  sure, we'd be glad to.  huh.  we'll do anything mom wants us to do.  you will.  thank you, greg.  no trouble.  i'll go get the guys.  i thought you said they weren't too enthusiastic.  that's funny. that's what i thought i said, too.  mrs. denton found this when she was tidying up the desks in her room.  please take a look at it.  marcia: "mrs. denton or a hippopotamus." is that your handwriting and your class.  yes, sir.  and did you draw that picture.  yes, sir, but that's not mrs. denton.  it's george washington.  george washington.  there's a picture of him on the wall and i was copying it.  and what about mrs. denton's name and that remark.  i didn't write her name, or that remark.  marcia, i think you'd better explain.  but i can't.  i mean... well...  i finished my classwork a little early and i was doodling and my name happened to be on the paper.  i doodled george washington.  i didn't doodle mrs. denton.  it doesn't look much like george washington.  i guess i'm not a very good artist.  you expect me to believe this is your paper, your name, and your drawing but you didn't write her name, or that remark.  that's right, mr. randolph.  marcia, i'd like to believe you.  you've always been a good student, but what you're saying doesn't sound logical.  but i didn't do it.  this sort of thing has happened beforetoo often.  not just you, but the other students.  but mr. randolph...  i'm afraid you're going to have to be the example.  you'll have to stay after school one hour every day for a week.  that's all, marcia.  except, because you'll be staying after school, i'll have to notify your parents.  carol: as much as we hate to do it, marcia, i'm afraid you can't have your slumber party.  my party.  mike: honey, that drawing might have seemed funny at the time, but you just must have respect for your teachers.  but i didn't do it.  i didn't write mrs. denton's name on it or that stupid remark.  your principal said you did, honey, and he's a very responsible man.  well, he wouldn't punish you for nothing.  you mean, you'd rather believe him than me.  marcia, from what you said, that paper was in your desk and your name was on it.  now, what else could mr. randolph think.  you don't believe me, either.  and if you don't, i don't want a party or anything ever from you.  choose freely.  move free ultra has tripleaction support for your joints, cartilage and bones in one tiny pill.  move free ultra.  get your move

we play again.  yeah. close those eyes.  it's not like her, honey.  i've never seen marcia so adamant.  that's one thing about marcia: when she's wrong, she admits it.  and the slumber party isn't the big problem.  it's the fact that we don't believe her.  mike, you think mr. randolph could be mistaken.  well, there's one way to find out.  mike: well, i can't vouch for the drawing, or what's printed underneath, but there's no doubt about the class and the name.  it's marcia's handwriting, all right.  there is only one conclusion i could reach, mr. brady.  oh, yes, of course.  it's, uh, just that marcia was so upset, i felt i had to speak to you.  i understand.  marcia's always been an excellent student, but, uh, well, we do have to preserve discipline.  oh, yes, my wife and i certainly agree with you on that.  well, thanks for your time, mr. randolph.  not at all.  i only wish more parents would take the time to get involved.  by the way, would you mind if i kept that.  oh, of course not. oh, thanks.  marcia.  yes.  your father and i have just had a little talk.  now, we don't know exactly what happened at school, but we think there's been a mistake.  we believe what you said about the picture.  thanks, mom.  well, you'll still have to go along with your punishment at school but the slumber party is on again.   thanks, mom.  oh, thank you.  oh, great. oh, great.   i wonder what's up.   hey, fellas, i just thought you'd like to know the slumber party's on again.  really. it is.  hooray.  well, i hardly expected that reaction.  well, we're kind of looking forward to it.  yeah.  oh, you are.  uh, they mean we're... we're looking forward to the girls having a good time.  oh, yeah, well, that's...  that's very nice of you, greg, all you boys.  we'll be glad to do anything to help the party along.  yeah, anything.   what's so funny.  nothing, nothing.  that dumb dodo laughs at anything.  yeah, he's got a real weird sense of humor.  okay.  aren't you happy.  about the party. yes...  and mom and dad believing me.  but i still have to stay after school for something i didn't do.  i wonder who did.  i've been thinking about that.  i've got english the nexttolast period in the afternoon, so i figure whoever used my desk for the last period might be the one.  hey, yeah.  that's the only one it could be.  do you know who it is.  jenny wilton.  jenny wilton.  she's your best friend.  shewasmy best friend.  what are you going to do.  i'll show you.  hello.  hello, jenny, this is marcia.  i called about the slumber party i'm having tomorrow night.  i can hardly wait.  well, it's only for my friends.  sure.  i'm your friend, marcia.  not anymore, you're not, so consider yourself uninvited.  marcia..  marcia.    alice: now, you two just run along.  have a good time at dinner.  remember, you have left the cavalry in charge.  well, hang on to your saddle, alice.  hey, where are the boys.  they're in their room studying.  studying on saturday night.  maybe we ought to take their temperature.  oh, come on, mike.  good luck, alice.  i don't need luck, mrs. brady, just a short course in riot control.  you two run along.   you guys, you guysshh.    let's all play another game.   how about truth or dare.  yeah, let's play that.  okay, and i'll go first.  paula, you're the one.  who's the cutest boy you know.  truth or dare.   greg brady.   now it's my turn to ask, and...  ruthie, you're the one.  truth or dare, have you ever been kissed by hank holman.   well, i'll take the dare.  all right, you...  have to go upstairs and see what marcia's brothers are doing.   karen, will you come with me, please.  not me.  i will.   shh.    it looked like a monster.  i think it was greg.  hot dogs, anyone.   alice: there's one... there's one for everybody.   a spider.  a big, hairy spider.  alice: wait, wait, let me get in here, kids.  let me in.  oh...   oh, looks like there's more than one tribe on the warpath.  my brothers.  those dumdums, all right.  hey, i forgot the potato salad here.    what happened.  nothing. i just lost my head.   or found somebody's head.  uh, i'll be right in.   sorry about that, alice.   what's happening now.  they're getting ready to turn off the lights and tell ghost stories.  okay, this is it.  the real action now.  yeah. yeah.  the last call for hot dogs.  girls: no, thanks.  okay.  now, if the werewolf howls and if the vampire starts flapping his wings, don't come running to me.  i'll be under the kitchen table.  okay.  okay, guys, now, listen.  hey, any of you monsters want a hot dog.  thanks, alice.  thanks, alice.  thanks, alice.  slowly, she started down the hall.  spiderwebs everywhere.  then she came to the door.  the door to the room where she had been forbidden to go.  slowly, she opened the door.   what was that.   i'm so scared, i'm getting itchy all over.  i'm itchy, too.  so am i.  yeah.  me, too.  oh, it's terrible.   i'll bet you it's my brothers again.  yeah... alice.   marcia: alice.  jan: stop them. stop them.  that's a crazy new dance you're doing.  why don't you put on some music.  no, alice, itching powder in the sleeping bags.  oh, my.  okay, look, we'll try and wash it off.  everybody upstairs.  come on, hurry up, in the shower.  come on, kids.  girl: it's terrible.  alice: all right.  boy, are my brothers going to regret this.  it itches, but it's kind of funny.  i like jokes.  what about the one we pulled on mrs. denton.  we.  yeah, you drew the picture, and i wrote the funny line.  you know, about the hippo.  youdidthat.  yeah. didn't you think it was funny.  funny. i got punished for that.  punished.  you did.  yeah.  i had to stay after school a whole week now.  i almost didn't have this party because of whatyouwrote.  gee, marcia, i'm sorry.  i didn't mean for anybody to see that but you.  well, they did, all right.  mrs. denton found it and turned it in to the principal.  i didn't know that.  would it help if i went to mr. randolph and explained.  that would be great.  gee, marcia, i just...  i just can't stand this itching anymore.  carol: hi, honey.  hey, where is everybody.  upstairs, itching.  i mean, washing off the itching powder.  mom, dad, i've done something just awful.  what.  i blamed jenny wilton for writing on my picturethe one that got me in trouble.  i told her she wasn't my friend anymore and i uninvited her to my party.  and jenny didn't do it.  mmmm, it was paula.  only she didn't mean any harm.  she just meant for me to see it.  well, dear, it seems to me that both you and jenny got a taste of the same medicine.  you were blamed for something because somebody didn't have all the facts.  you turned around and did the same thing to jenny.  i feel awful.  what can i do.  well, look, dear, it's still early.  why don't you call jenny and invite her over to the party.  i sure will.  i'll give her the biggest apology i know how.   carol: ooh, excuse me.
