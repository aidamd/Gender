severe chronic plaque psoriasis.  so i finally made a decision to talk to my dermatologist about humira. inside my body to target and help block a specific source of inflammation that contributes to my symptoms.  in clinical trials, most adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis saw 75% skin clearance on humira.  and the majority of people were clear or almost clear in just 4 months.  humira can lower your ability to fight infections, including tuberculosis. serious, sometimes fatal infections and cancers, including lymphoma, have happened. as have blood, liver, and nervous system problems, serious allergic reactions, and new or worsening heart failure.  before treatment, get tested for tb.  tell your doctor if you've been to areas where certain fungal infections are common, and if you've had tb, hepatitis b, are prone to infections, or have flulike symptoms or sores.  don't start humira if you have an infection.  set a new goal today.  ask your dermatologist about humira.  because with humira clearer skin is possible.  xx rings) trick or treat.  mmm.  thank you.  mmm.  mmm.  ]     it takes two hands to eat a manwich.  leaving zero hands to save the universe.
