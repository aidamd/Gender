lugosi wearing wet sneakers.  i told you not to watch the... horror movie.  oh, yeah... maybe i did imagine it.  i'm sorry i woke you.  good night.  you mean good morning.   there, you see. you heard it, too.  it must be that hot water heater acting up again.  no, it was definitely a kaboom, kaboom, kaboom.  when the heater acts up, it goes bloopbloopbloop.  it must be trouble.  i'll go see.    greg.  do you know what time it is.  oh, sure, that's why i'm working out down here.  did i wake you.  oh, no, i've always wanted to rise before dawn to greet the coming of a glorious new day.  thanks a lot, greg.  listen, what is this sudden urge for muscles.  if a guy's got to pitch, he's got to be in shape.  i can't quarrel with that.  i got seven innings to go saturday.  that's the spirit.  if you're going to do something, you've got to give it all you got.  right.  yeah, well, there's just one thing: there are some other people in this house who don't have to pitch on saturday.  there are others who can't afford to miss one minute of their beauty sleep, like me.  she's right.  okay.   greg: i'll do my jogging now.  dad. mmhmm.  what's the biggest bonus any ball player ever got.  the biggest bonus.   well, i seem to remember that the angels paid one guy about $200,000.  $200,000.  man, oh, man.  huh. what did i tell you.  i'm going to be loaded.  oh, yeah. well, listen, bub.  before you start spending all that money, you better realize that out of a thousand young hopefuls, only one makes it.  oh, well, i'm not worried.  i'll be the one.  do you mind. i'll just be a second. oh, thank you.  that's okay, i'm just memorizing some important dates.  oh, well, that's one nice thing about history: you never run out of dates.  yeah...  you know what real important thing happened in 1839.  1839. well, uh... i'll take a stab at it.  was that the year samuel morse invented the telegraph.  i don't know about that.  but 1839 was the year abner doubleday laid out the first baseball diamond.  now, that really was a memorable event.  i'll say.  you know what happened in 1903.  babe ruth threw the first forward pass.  oh, mom, that was the year of the first world series.  it's all right here in this baseball encyclopedia.  you want me to explain the infield fly rule.  i don't think so.  but i would like to ask you a question.  have you finished your homework yet.  i'll get to it.  greg...  how about right now.  in a minute, mom, in a minute.  greg.  mom, please.  he eats and sleeps baseball.  it's become an obsession.  well, maybe he has gone overboard a little.  a little.  to him, american history doesn't even begin until 1839.  1839.  the year abner holiday invented baseball.  : abner doubleday.  oh, honey, i think greg's acting fairly normal under the circumstances.  what circumstances.  well, the fact he's pitching for his team now.  a great player like don drysdale pats him on the back.  that's the dream of every american boy.  well... far be it from me to be unamerican.  hi, honey.  no, i appreciate your calling, mrs. pearson.  i'm just as concerned as you are.  no, it just isn't like greg.  believe me, his father and i will have a talk with him.  and we really appreciate your calling, mrs.  pearson.  right. bye.  what's up.  i can tell you whatisn'tupgreg's grades this week.  that was one of his teachers.  i don't get that. he's always done real well.  not this time.  greg.  greg: yes, dad.  can you come down here for a minute.  well, he's a pretty levelheaded kid.  i think we can straighten it all out.  i hope so.  what is it, dad.   sit down.  look, son, your teacher, mrs. pearson, called and said you didn't turn in your history assignment. true.  i didn't have time.  but you did have time to memorize the batting averages of every player in the major league.  well, that's important.  your schoolwork isn't.  i'm going to be a baseball player.  they don't have to know anything...  well, i mean, except for baseball.  look, just the same, you start hitting those books, right.  greg, you're going to need good grades to get into college.  college.  who cares about college.  i don't even know why i have to finish high school.  i got a great career ahead of me in baseball.  smell air.  i thought there was a lot of cheese on the cheesy pub chicken sandwich, but you clearly went all out here.  well, 'tis the cheeson,

shouldn't have a talk with greg.  oh, honey, i'm sure he didn't mean what he said.  i don't think we have a high school dropout on our hands.  i guess not.  kids say a lot of things they don't really mean.  mom, dad, can i ask you something.  sure, any time. what's up.  well, if greg doesn't have to finish high school, why do i have to finish junior high school.  and if pete doesn't have to finish junior high, why do i have to finish grammar school.  well, i think we better have that talk with greg.  talk about what.  mike: baseball.  oh, well, sure. what do you want to know.  look, greg, baseball is a great sport...  i know. all right, wait a minute.  but there are other things in life just as important.  or even more important.  yeah, look, you can go into baseball if you're good enough, but there's nothing wrong with going to college first.  what about guys like joe dimgio.  or mickey mantle or yogi berra.  now, they never went and they did all right.  greg, you can't pin all your hopes on just one thing in life.  right. it doesn't hurt to be able to do several things well.  i know, that's why i'm working on my hitting and fieldingin case my pitching arm goes.  boy, i sure am glad i have a mom and dad who understand.  oh, boy.  me and my big mouth.  well, nobody is blaming you, don.  well, it's just that i love the game and i like to encourage the kids, that's all.  oh, you encouraged him, all right.  well, look, you name it and i'll do it.  i think right now greg thinks that baseball is just one big bed of roses, see.  yeah, maybe you could make him realize that there are a few thorns in it.  hmm, a few thorns.  i tell ya, i've been stuck as much as anybody.   well, that's what we'd like to get across to greg.  great... let's go.  hi, mr. drysdale.  i mean don.  hello, greg. how are you, son.  just great.  guess what. i'm pitching today.  you know how he feels before the game, don't you, don.  the old nerves twitching.  oh, listen, i'll tell you.  when those butterflies start kicking you in the stomach...  i don't know. i can hardly eat the day that i pitch.  not me. for breakfast, i had hotcakes sausage and a couple of eggs.  yeah, but i bet the jitters really hit you when the fans start riding you, don't they.  oh, and do they ride you.  you know, it's funnyyou're a hero one minute and a bum the next.  you serve up a couple of home run balls, and...  i don't know, you feel you want to sneak out of the ballpark.   i'll bet that never happened to you.  oh, many times.  i'll tell you, i used to keep a false beard and dark glasses in my locker.  : oh, wow.  go on down, let's see something.  i guess being a baseball player probably is more glamorous from the bleachers, huh, don.  well, i'll tell you, baseball isn't what it's all cracked up to be.  look at me, 34 years old and my career is finished.  mike: yeah, but you can do something else.  i mean, you went to college.  well, that's true, but there's a lot of guys that i broke in with, they're still in the minor leagues trying to make a living.  yeah.  mike: well, i guess baseball isn't all fun and glory.  far from it.  sitting up all night in brokendown buses.  sometimes you get stuck in secondrate hotels.  sleep all night with your arm packed in ice.  oh, yeah, that's some fun and glory.  yeah, well, that really makes you think, doesn't it, greg.  yeah, it sure does.  greg, take it easy, okay.  see you later.  thanks, don.  thanks for everything, don.  but you know, actually he told greg nothing but the truth.  well, how did greg take it.  oh, he got the message.  mmm. good.  boy, what don said sure made me think.  it did, greg.  yeah...  i'm not gonna let those things happen to me.  hey, good boy.  i'm gonna start right at the top.  none of that minor league stuff for me.  well... what ab... what about the things he said.  thethe jitters and the pressure and the aches and pai... the arm packed in ice.  oh, heck, a cold arm isn't bad for all that money.  that's all you got out of the conversation.  oh, no. he told me a lot of stuff about buses and cheap hotels.  but he meant the guys who weren't good enough, and i'm going to be a star.  yep, they'll be lucky if they get a foul tip off me today.  somebody is riding for a big fall.  and i know who's going to be there to pick up the pieces.   hey, where are you going.  to our ballet lesson. it's saturday.  ballet. when you can see me pitch.  jan: hey, what's that.  oh, it's a quick energizer i got out of a health magazine.  what's in it.  turnip tops and beet bottoms and wheat germ and cod liver oil.  i think i'm going to be sick.  mmm... delicious.  but i better not get too much energy at once.  you can have the rest of it if you want.  how's it look.  aren't you going to wait for dad.  naw, i'm riding my bike over.    how was the ballet lesson.  wonderfulyou ought to come sometime.  yeah, in my tutu.  in my case, better make that a twotwo by fourfour.  : oh...  greg...  hi, mom. hi, alice.  what are you doing home so soon.  they call off the game.  can't a guy come home without a lot of questions.  hi, honey.  mike, what's the matter with greg.  is the game over already.  no, no.  well, didn't he pitch.  oh, yeah, he pitched, all right.  they clobbered him.  he couldn't get anybody out.  yeah, they scored 12 runs in the first inning.  then the coach gave greg the hook.  yeah, all right, boys, that's enough.  come on, take this upstairs.  was it really as bad as all that, mr. brady.  oh, it was a massacre.  he was so cocky, he wouldn't listen to the coach, and he really got his lumps.  aw, the poor kid.  well, it had to happen.  mike...  i think you better start picking up the pieces.  greg.  greg.  mind if i come in.  no.  listen, um...  about the game today...  who cares about a stupid old game.  well, anybody can have an off day.  come on, next time you'll mow them down.  there won't be any next time.  i've got more important things to do.  do you really.  who wants to travel around in old buses and have to worry about being traded.  and butterflies in your stomach.  i'm never going to play that dumb game again.   you're going to go way overboard the other way.  listen...   baseball is a great game.  but it's just one part of life.  there are other things important, too.  come on.  education is important. )
