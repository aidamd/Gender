 rome.  sure.  before xarelto, mary took warfarin, which required monthly trips to get her blood tested.  but that's history.  back to the museum.  not this time.  now that her doctor switched her to onceaday xarelto, mary can leave those monthly trips behind.  domestic flight.  not today.  like warfarin, xarelto is proven effective to reduce afibrelated stroke risk.  but xarelto is the first and only onceaday prescription blood thinner for patients with afib not caused by a heart valve problem that doesn't require regular blood monitoring.  so mary is free of that monitoring routine.  for patients currently well managed on warfarin, there is limited information on how xarelto and warfarin compare in reducing the risk of stroke.  xarelto is just one pill a day taken with the evening meal.  spinach.  grazie.  plus, with no known dietary restrictions, mary can eat the healthy foods she likes.  don't stop taking xarelto, rivaroxaban, unless your doctor tells you to.  while taking xarelto, you may bruise more easily and it may take longer for bleeding to stop.  xarelto may increase your risk of bleeding if you take certain medicines.  xarelto can cause serious bleeding, and in rare cases, may be fatal.  get help right away if you develop unexpected bleeding, unusual bruising, or tingling.  if you have had spinal anesthesia while on xarelto, watch for back pain or any nerve or muscle related signs or symptoms.  do not take xarelto if you have an artificial heart valve or abnormal bleeding.  tell your doctor before all planned medical or dental procedures.  before starting xarelto, tell your doctor about any conditions, such as kidney, liver, or bleeding problems.  switching to xarelto was the right move for mary.  ask your doctor about onceaday xarelto.  no regular bloodmonitoring. no known dietaryrestrictions.  for information andsavings options download the xareltopatient center app, call 1888xarelto, or visit goxarelto.com applebee's new allyoucaneat

too.  yeah, but i think i'll wait.  i don't want to spoil my appetite for that delicious fresh fish.  oh, well, if you can wait, i can wait.  i'll just use a little psychology.  i took psychology in school.  you did, alice.  yeah, if you don't think about food, you won't get hungry, so i just... won't... think about food.  good.  come to think of it, i flunked psychology.  jan: mom.  oh, alice, wait a minute.  here come greg and jan.  ooh, better get those frying pans ready.  okay, let's have them.  go ahead, tell them all about the big one that got away because of me.  and i was not afraid of it.  i couldn't help it.  i had good grip on it, but i let go 'cause it felt... fishy.  and of course, all her screaming scared all the other fish away.  well, don't worry about it, greg.  i'm sure the others will catch enough fish for all of us.  i'm going to go wash my hands.  well, how's a fish supposed to feel if it doesn't feel fishy.  i hope somebody likes sardines.  that's the best you can catch when somebodywho shall be namelessbreaks your line.  marcia: i did not break it.  i walked into it by mistake.  it felt like a cobweb, and i got all tangled up.  i didn't know you were scared of cobwebs.  i wasn't scared.  it tickled me.  well, i guess dear ol' dad will have to be the big provider.  yuck.  hiya, bobby. where's daddy.  right behind me.  ah, good, did he catch anything.  did he. wow.  how big.  this big. see.  what on earth.... daddy caught cindy just in time.  just in time to get her soaked and scare all the fish away.  aw. well, sweetheart, if you wanted to go swimming why didn't you say so.  i didn't swim on purpose. i swum on accident.  well, if you excuse me and this pintsized mermaid, i'll get her into some dry clothes.  come on.  well, i don't suppose my girls will win any trout contests.  oh, honey, the girls couldn't help it.  problem now is, what are we going to eat.  wait one second.  i had a whopper this long just begging to be caught.  yeah, me, too.  surprise.  the girls and i packed this in the car in case of an emergency.  how's that for a brilliant mother.  hey, carol, you're a lifesaver.  we're starving to death.  carol: well, we have cold cuts, cheese and fried chicken.  just name your poison.  anything and everything.  dad, no. huh.  that's sissy food.  oh, well, yeah, but...  we always live off the land.  i know but...  okay, okay, if you want to chicken out.  i'm not chickening out. i'm being realistic.  also thankful.  listen, if your mother's thoughtful enough to bring this food out here, the least you can do is eat it.  cold cuts, cheese, salami, fried chicken.  we might as well camp in a supermarket.  better to eat in a supermarket than to starve at camp.  mmm, that's delicious.  mmm, delectable.  simply melts in your mouth.  i can't stand that kind of pressure.  let me at it.  me, too.  well, honey, so far so good.  yeah, the kids are really enjoying themselves.  mmhmm, so am i.  you know what.  it's kind of romantic out here.  yeah.  and we finally found a moment alone together.  marcia: mom, can we have some water.  just a minute.  greg: hey, dad, where are the blankets.   togetherness, huh.  good night, honey.  good night, dear.  togetherness, huh.     what was that..  i don't know.  well, i'm not sure.  mike. mike.  what's the matter.  what's that noise.  what noise.   that noise.   that's not a noise.  that's an owl hooting.  he won't bother you.   thanks, honey.  good night.  good night. good night.  good night, dad.   ifif that's an owl, he's got a frog in his throat.  what was the matter, dad.  huh. oh, nothing.  the girls just wanted to know what a noise was.  turned out to be a owl.  boy, are they scaredycats.  oh, yeah.  well, it seems to me i remember last year about this time that you were pretty frightened of those owls.  well, i was just a little kid then.  all right, you guys, if we're going to go hiking tomorrow, you better get some sleep.  good night, dad. good night, dad.  good night.   : what's that noise.  i may be wrong, and i certainly hope i am, but it sounds like a rattlesnake.  a rattlesnake.    for heaven's sake, what is it..  it's got me.  it's got me. it's got me.  what's got you. what's got you.  i don't know, but can't you hear it.  i think it's in the sleeping bag with me.  oh, alice.  nothing's got you.  with all that hardware on your head, you punctured your air mattress.  oh, thank goodness.  for a minute there, i thought i was a goner.  you'll have to forgive us, honey.  it's our first night of camping, and we're just a little nervous.   girls, try to be calm.  there are no wild animals in this area.  none of any kind.  absolutely none.  so just try to be calm and sleep tight, huh.  thanks, honey. good night, dad.  good night. good night, daddy.  good night, daddy. good night.  what happened. what'd they want.  what was it. what....  and how are we supposed to get any sleep with the girls along.  that's enough, bobby.  the trouble with them is they get scared at every little sound.  didn't you hear mei said that's enough.  well, you said it to bobby, not to me.  well, i'm saying it to you now.  and before you open your big mouth, i'm saying it to you, too.  don't you remember.  it was the girls who brought all that food.  oh, that's right, fellas.  it was pretty good, too.  well, i guess women are okay for some things.  all right, boys.  let's scare them now.   dad, a bear.  dad.  a bear. a bear.  a bear.  there really is a bear.  mike: boys... boys, wait.     well, you finally got what you wanted.
