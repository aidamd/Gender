just don't understand what's gotten into sam.  he sure was sore this afternoon.  cindy, when did you speak to sam.  he phoned when alice was at the door hugging the postman.  maybe that's what made him mad.  well, i was hugging the postman because i'd won the cont...  how did sam know that.  i told him.  mike: oh, cindy.  alice, why don't you and i go in the kitchen and call sam back.  maybe, between the two of us, we can straighten this thing out.  alice: oh, please, mrs. brady.  sam is just so jealous.  yeah, i think the time's come for a little onesided discussion here.  hop up there.   i want you to listen to me very carefully.  cindy, you know, you've done a very bad thing with your tattling.  yes, daddy.  i know it's difficult for a little girl to know what to say and what not to say.  grownups have that same problem.  but you have to learn when to keep quiet.  but what if someone asks me where mommy is.  can't i tell them.  yes, of course you can.  even if she's hugging the postman.  cindy, the point is that you are not to tattle about other peoples' business anymore.  now, i mean never.  because, if you do, you're going to be punished.  is that clear.  yes, daddy.  good. i hope so.  well, we just spoke to sam.  everything's fine.  he'll be right over.  and as for you, young lady...  daddy already told me.  well, i hope you were firm enough, mike.  he was.

believe that.  well, i'll believe it when i don't hear it.  marcia, what are the seven wonders of the world.  seven wonders.  i've got six so far.  what's the matter.  what happened downstairs.  i can't tell you.  it's tattling.  if cindy won't tattle, there's your seventh wonder.  come on, cindy.  you can tell us.  i can't, because it might get someone into trouble.  who.  me and someone else.

rubber bone in here for tiger.  maybe it will curb his appetite for taking things. tiger.  i think he's kind of busy.  honey, come on in the house.  you can help us unpack.    anybody going to answer the phone.   guess i am.  hello.  yeah.  who.  oh, yeah.  i'm sure she wants to talk to you.  uh... hang on a second.  i'll see if she's home. alice.  alice, telephone.  got it, mr. brady.  honey, put this in mommy's sewing basket, will you, please.  well, i have to find tiger.  you can do that later, dear. go on.  it's the everprest fabric company.  oh, it must be about the prize.  i wonder what i won.  well.  maybe it's a trip somewhere.  well... maybe a fur coat.  well... maybe a car.  alice.  what.  ask the man.  oh, yeah, yeah.  hello. hello. sorry to keep you waiting.  this is alice nelson.  what did i win.  what.  oh, i'm sorry.  keep talking.  i'll get it here.  i really won a hifi stereo set..  what do i have to do to get it.  uh, wait, wait. just a second.  yeah, uh, lloyd's

well, you know that certificate i didn't get.  yeah. yeah.  i got to get it to lloyd's stereo center before midnight tonight or it expires.  boy, they sure give you a lot of time.  if i don't show up, they keep the prize.  there's still a few hours left to find that certificate.  maybe it's stuck in the mailbox.  remember the time the letter did that.  maybe the same thing happened to my letter.

please.  what happened to the letter.  but i can't tell you.  sweetheart, i have to know.  but i promised not to tattle anymore.  well, look, dear, this is different.  i give you permission to tattle.  mrs. brady, would you order her to tattle.  look, cindy, this letter is very important to alice.  now, where is it.  but i can't tell you because it might get tiger into trouble.  tiger.  we might have known.  hah. i got it.  oh, good. got it, mrs. brady.  with the holes he chewed, it's going to look like an ibm card.  come on, let's get it open.  oh, alice, oh, the certificate's fine.   i'll
