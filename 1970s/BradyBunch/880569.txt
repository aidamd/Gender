sparkles.  ..  which one is better.  which one.  she made hers for a 47foot fairy.  they're not that big.  well, what do you think.  well, they're too big for a butterfly.  cindy is not playing a butterfly.  she's playing a fairy princess with wings.  i say that these wings are perfect.  they're too big.  how do you know.  know what.  how big a fairy's wings are.  have you seen a fairy.  i've seen a butterfly.  i carefully cut out these wings according to the directions.  how come yours are bigger.  i made my own directions.  i want everybody in the audience to notice cindy.  greg: they'll notice her anyway.  cindy looks like a fairy princess even without wings.  marcia: i can't wait to see her in the play.  jan: mom and dad will be real proud of her.  i learned how to whistle through my teeth.  am i going to cheer for cindy.  i can clap louder than anybody.  marcia: i'll bet she'll have the best audience of all.  cindy.  cindy.  yes, mommy.  would you stand over here, dear.  what you doing.  oh, i'm trying to decide which color to use for your costume.  mommy, when you have to decide between two things how do you know which is right.  well, you don't always.  sometimes you have to use your intuition.  what's that.  it's a little voice inside you that tells you what to do.  who tells the little voice.  a big voice, i guess.  suppose it tells you to do two different things at the same time.  well, then, my love, you've got a problem.  mommy.  hmm.  i was thinking.  maybe the play isn't going to be so good.  and you don't even have to come if you don't want to.  don't want to.  oh, darling, wild horses couldn't keep me away.  hiya, punkin.  how are rehearsals coming.  okay.  it's just a dumb old play anyway.  "dumb old play".  you can't talk like that to prince victor.  ribbit, ribbit, ribbit.  itisa dumb old play.  honey, what's the matter.  yesterday you were jumping around here.  the boys giving you a rough time.  'cause you tell me if they are.  i want to know.  it's not that.  i don't think the play is big deal anymore.  and you don't even have to come if you don't want to.  don't want to.  oh, sweetheart, i wouldn't miss that for anything in the world.  now, you run along and play and i'll see you later.  oh, hi, cindy.  hi. what were you doing.  nothing.  just trying to see how'd i'd look with faye dunaway's nose.  what's up.  promise you won't tell.  sure.  well, i can only invite one person to see me in the play.  only one ticket.  that's all.  and i don't know who to give it to.  you have to ask daddy or you'll hurt his feelings.  mom will understand.  but what about mommy's feelings.  she doesn't even care about wild horses.  cindy, you just don't understand about adjustments.  justments.  sit down.  we're all going through adjustments.  you see, mom and dad and all the kids.  you have to try hard to remember how the other guy feels.  i know how the other guy feels.  she wants to come to the play, too.  listen, cindy, you have to invite our new daddy or you'll mess up his adjustment.  are you sure.  if you don't believe me, ask greg.  hi.  cindy, don't you know how to knock.  yes, but the door wasn't closed.  well, you shouldn't sneak up on people.  i wasn't sneaking.  you just didn't see me 'cause you were looking at your muscle.  is it getting bigger.  never mind that.  what'd you want.  well, i can only invite one person to see me in the play.  and marcia says i better ask daddy or i'll mess up his justment.  is that right.  no.  no.  don't you know ladies cry and get uptight over junk like seeing their kids in plays.  you better ask mom 'cause if you hurt her feelings and make her cry dad'll get mad.  honey, did you notice anything strange about cindy today.  she's a little nervous about the play.  she ran the strangest dialogue past me a few minutes ago.  she did the same thing to me.  anyone offering a trip to europe for the answer.  huh. parents are always the last to know.  i feel like a fink.  i promised her i wouldn't tell.  she wants to make up her own mind.  about what.  mrs. engstrom called from school.  she said that each kid could only invite one parent to the play.  oh, poor baby.  i promised her, but i thought you ought to know.  poor baby.  eenie, meenie, mommy, daddy.  eenie, meenie, mommy, daddy.  ..  wish i was never in that dumb old play.  all right, now, children, let's get ready for rehearsal.  you stand over here, dear.  that's fine.  and you right over here.  no, no. not behind his head.  now you right over here.  ..  .. why are you limping.  i was playing tag with my brothers and i twisted my left ankle.  so i guess i can't be the fairy princess.  oh, the play isn't for two days.  your ankle should be better by then.  no, i think it'll get worse.  i'm sorry, mrs. engstrom.  mary ditmeyer can do it.  and she won't mess up any justments.  cindy, i thought you said you twisted your left ankle.  i did.  then why are you limping on your other ankle.  i think they both hurt now.  it's just a dumb old play anyway.  nobody can turn a prince into a bullfrog.  hi, sweetheart.  oh, hi, daddy.  punkin, tell me something.  would you be very upset if i didn't come to see your play.  well, why, daddy.  )%well, suppose that i had a business meeting that night out of town.  out of town.  would it be all right with you if i went to that instead of your play.  oh, boy.  that's sure too bad.  that's awful, daddy.  where are you going.  i have to call mrs. engstrom.  i have to talk to her before she talks to

the whole picture.  ask your doctor about trilipix.  if you're at high risk of heart disease and taking a statin to lower bad cholesterol, along with diet, adding trilipix can lower fatty triglycerides and raise good cholesterol to help improve all three cholesterol numbers.  trilipix has not been shown to prevent heart attacks or stroke more than a statin alone.  trilipix is not for everyone, including people with liver, gallbladder, or severe kidney disease, or nursing women.  tell your doctor about all the medicines you take and if you are pregnant or may become pregnant.  blood tests are needed before and during treatment to check for liver problems.  contact your doctor if you develop unexplained muscle pain or weakness, as this can be a sign of a rare but serious side effect.  this risk may be increased when trilipix is used with a statin.  if you cannot afford your medication, call 18664trilipix for more information.  trilipix.  there's more to cholesterol.  get the picture.  boy, when you take a spill you really do it up right.  i've had worse than this lots of times.  if you saw the banana on the street why didn't you miss it. )
