to ask you if there's any mail for us here by mistake.  nope. not a clue.  she wants the bradys' mail, larry.  thank you, darling.  so kind of you to climb out from under your hangover.  let's see. where did i file your mail.  oh, yes.  hi, honey.  hi.  how's your daddy.  he's fine. mrs. brady's lucky to have a big, strong, virile man like that.  tell you what, sweetie.  next christmas, you tell your daddy i'd be more than happy to wrap his package.  okay.  here. hit the road, bad seed.  excuse me, but the juice will make your shoes slip.  : what.  your shoes'll slip in the juice.  oh.  bye.  byebye.   daddy, mrs. dittmeyer said that she'd be glad to wrap your package this christmas.  hmm... really.  how is mrs. dittmeyer.  mr. dittmeyer says she's overhung.  but he's not in a good mood because she's taking it in the rear.  alice: must be that paperboy again.  cindy, that's mr. dittmeyer's business.  remember, nobody likes a snitch.  i'm not a snitch.  i just tell it like it is.  you know, cindy, when you tattle on someone, you're not just telling on them.  you're telling on yourself.  and, by tattling on someone, you're really just telling them, "i'm a tattletale." now, is that the tale you want to tell.  i never thought of it like that.  sweetheart, it's time to get your school things together, honey.  okay, mommy.  hmm...  what is it, mike.  it's a letter from the county.  they say we haven't paid our property taxes.  haven't paid our taxes.  we always pay our taxes.  well, they say it's the fifth notice, and we owe them $20,000 by the end of the week or they'll auction our house.  .  there has to be a mixup.  well, we better call someone.  we are.  you do.  uhhuh. uhhuh.  i see.  we should..  you are..  uhhuh.  all right. goodbye.   we owe them.  oh, mike.  well, don't you worry, honey.  we'll find the money.  find the money.  but we used our savings to go to the grand canyon and hawaii.  what are we going to do, mike.  okay, troops...  time for school.  greg.  marcia.  peter.  jan.  bobby.  cindy.  oh. oh.  oh. oh.  do we always have to walk so close.  all: oh, jan.  uh... mom, can i borrow your car today.  i want to ask donna leonard to go out for a soda after school.  all right, but no hotrodding.  thanks, mom.  she's the most farout chick in my class.  you wouldn't believe how much i dig her.  alice: sure, i would.  i've been digging sam so long, by the time he proposes, i'll be six feet under.   oh, alice, what would we do without you.  probably eat out.   hey, why the long face, bobby.  well, ever since i became a safety monitor at school...  nobody will talk to me.  they think i'm some kind of fink.  bobby, people like to be corrected when they're doing something wrong.  that's how we improve ourselves.  right, dad.  and, if your sister would wear her glasses, she just might improve her eyesight.  marcia doesn't have to wear glasses.  besides, all my friends at school say glasses make me look positively goofy.  now, honey, you look very lovely with your glasses on.  doesn't she, kids.  far out, jan. yeah. yeah.  greg: you look great.  yeah, i mean it. out of sight.   mike: all right, troops, off to school.  carol: goodbye.  have a good day.  greg: bye, mom. bye, dad.  bye, mom.  come on, marcia.  i'm coming.  jan, a real friend likes you for who you are, not what's on your face.  if you judge your friends for passing judgment on you, you're not only judging yourself you're judging your friends for judging you.  and that would be using bad judgment.  i never thought of it that way.  carol: jan.  oh.  bye.  carol: bye, honey.   bye, bobby.  bye, jan.  oh.  oh. oh.   ow.     hey, you stupid little punk kid.    davy jones is the most.  i sure wish he'd write back.  i wrote him over a month ago.  but, marcia, he gets millions of letters.  buti'mpresidentof his flub and i invited him to entertain at the school dance.  a big rock star like that can't just drop everytngfor our dance.  geez, you can be so silly sometimes.  all right, everybody outhis is a rjack.  well, of course this is a car.  but my name's not jackit's greg.  and this is my sister, marcia.  hi.  and you are.  eddie. wait a minute. didn't you hear me.  get out now.  this is a carjacking.  oh, greg, i think he has a flat tire.  he must need a jack.  sorry, eddie.  we don't have a jack.  but don't worry. i'll call aaa as soon as we get to school.  it was so nice to meet you.  byebye.  man: hey, you moron.  out of the way, jerk.  now, don't worry about the house, honey.  i'm sure mr. phillips will advance me the money.  oh, of course he will.  you're the best player on his team.  mmm. go get 'em, tiger.  tiger... tiger...  whatever happened to that dog.   brady.  morning, larry.  you know, i was just reading about some beautiful property available up in utah.  i'll bet you'd feel right at home there.  blue skies, clean living, osmonds.  thanks, larry, but i'm still not interested in moving.  i love this house.  carol loves it, the kids love it, alice loves it.  it was our first house all together.  half a miltake it or leave it.  like i said, there's nothing that could get us to sell.  i designed this house myself.  it's in perfect condition.  carol thinks so, the kids think so, alice thinks so.  sorry.  well, you can't blame a guy for trying, huh.   putz.  uh... excuse me, mr. dittmeyer...  but as a member of the safety patrol, i must warn you that your hedge is overgrown and can block the view of the street for oncoming traffic.  i know this, because i was on my bike and checked out the sight lines myself.  hmm. well, you see, billy...  bobby.  ke it matters.  i grew my hedge tall for a reason.  so i wouldn't have to see your family.   thank you for your concern.      alarm voice: you are standing too close to the vehicle.  . i've seen the future, and this is... .    . ...warmer, girl .  . making the music softer... .  see you later.  hey, there, groovy chick.  oh, great.  do i look

dance with me.  sure. that would be a blast.  cool. you'll hear from me.  great.  he's so out of sight.   oh, my gosh.  i just remembered.  what.  i already told charlie i would go to the dance with him.  so.  so i can't go out with two boys at once.  i like charlie, but doug is so cute.  and, after all, heisthe big man on campus.  noreen, what am i going to do.  this is the worst mess i've ever gotten myself into.  the worst.  oh...  my life is over.   teacher: so, that is what males experience during the onset of puberty.  now, as far as the young women are concerned...  first, we begin with ovulation and its effect on the female body.   peter.  : yes, miss lynley.  why don't you come up here and take the pointer... and we will trace the path of the ovum through the fallopian tube,

did you hit a home run today.  my design didn't even make it to first base.   you know, maybe we should think about taking mr. dittmeyer up on his offer.  you're serious about selling the house.  carol, i designed this house myselfevery color, every brick, every sheet of formica.  if i knew another way out, i'd take it.  but where else are we going to find $20,000 by the end of the week.  oh,

tell you something.  okay.  but i can't tell you, 'cause that would be tattling.  come on, cindy.  if it's important, it's not tattling.  i'm never going to tell that mom and dad have to sell the house because they owe $20,000.  oops.  and that's why i called this meeting.  greg, what are we going to do.  yeah. if we don't raise $20,000 in one week, we'll have to move.  and go to a new school.  and make new friends.  bu jan, you don't have any friends.  greg: wait. we can save the house.  we can raise the money ourselves.  but how.  well, we can each get jobs and earn extra money.  : hey,

gloom.  well, we just had a kid meeting and, well, we decided that we don't mind if we have to move.  we tried to raise the money for the tax bill ourselves, but there are only two days left and all we could come up with was $110.  what.  how did you know about the house and the tax bill.  oops.  cindy, do i have to remind you that when you tattle on somebody, you're not just telling on them, you're telling on yourself and...  all: telling them that you're a tattletale.  we've heard it, dad. thanks.  kids, you have nothing to worry about.  today, your father sold a design, and now he can get that $20,000 advance.   i appreciate what you all tried to do and from now on, no more secrets.  the important thing is we still have our home so, let's celebrate.  put on your sunday best, kids.

"joint consolidated tax bill: final notice." "dear mr. brady...  "due to your failure to pay...  house will be auctioned 2:00 p.m. tomorrow..." $20,000.  dina.  dina...  this is the greatest day of our lives.  did the kids run away.  no. we are rich.  we are going to be filthy, stinking, disgustingly rich.  larry.  yeah.  get me my ice mask.  forget your ice mask.  we're going to be so rich you can hire an eskimo to sit on your face.   it's open.  of course it is.   morning.  morning, larry.  if you're here about the offer, the answer's still no.  i haven't changed my mind.  no need for that.  i know you won't be selling this house because, after the auction tomorrow at 2:00, i'll own it.  well, i don't think there'll be any auction.  what.  well, luckily, i just sold one of my designs, so it looks like the bradys are here to stay.  so, which firm was lucky enough to snag one of your designs, mike.  larry: and, of course if you ever need a property for one of your health clubs i'm your man.  oh, thank you.  well, well. what have we here.  this is one of our new gyms that we're constructing.  we are negotting to buy the design right now.  really. who's your architect.  a very talented fellowname of brady.  i guess you won't be breaking ground until after he dries out.  dries out.  i really shouldn't say anything.  guy's been through a lot lately, what with the charges filed against him and everything.  charges.  criminal negligence.  a building he designed completely collapsed.  old folks' home, christmas day.  all those cute, little visiting grandchildren...  some with puppies.  let's take a moment to honor their memory, shall we.     i'll get it.  brady residence.  you did. i see.  when.  uhhuh.  they did.  why not.  uhhuh... oh.  yeah.  right.  well...  bye.  bad news, i'm afraid.  oh, mike. what.  the flex factory pulled out of the project this morning.  they're not going with my design.  oh, mike. why.  well, they wouldn't say.  i guess this means it's over.  unless a miracle happens by 2:00 tomorrow, the county is going to auction our house.  oh, mike. how.  kids, i'm afraid the money that we were counting on is no longer a possibility.  but i want you to remember that no matter where we go, or whatever house we're in, we'll be fine as long as we're together, so i don't want to see any more frowns.  we're bradys.  and as a wise man once said: "wherever you go, there you are." i never thought of it that way, dad.  marcia: thanks, dad.  bobby: boy, this is crummy.  well, there must be some way out of this mess.  everybody think.  hey, i've got it.  we can enter that "search for the stars" contest.  first prize is exactly $20,000.  hey, that's a nifty idea, marcia.  great idea, marcia.  good idea, marcia.  am i invisible.  do i not have a voice.  i had that idea two days ago.  stop being so selfish, jan.  come on, jan.  oh, jan.  jan. jan.  come on, you guys, we got a big day ahead of us.  we better get some rest if we're going to be a fresh, young musical group.  it was my idea. mine.  didn't anybody hear me.  i heard you.  me, too, but it sounded better coming from marcia.   sam, that was the juiciest meat cutters' ball i've ever been to.  i'm cooked.  alice, i want you to stick out your hand and close your eyes.  i got a surprise for you.  unless it fits on my finger, i've got to hit the sack.  it better fit, or i'm going to have to take it back.  sam, i thought this day would never come.  when i saw it, i thought it was right up your alley.  i'm bowled over.   i always thought our grandchildren would come visit us in this house.  oh, mike.  you know, this is going to be our last night in this bedroom.  why, grandpa brady.   jan, where are you going.  someplace where i can be appreciated.  go ahead and snitch if you want.  just give me a head start.  i wouldn't snitch.  but how will we sing without you.  why don't you ask marcia.  maybe she has another brilliant idea.   mom. dad.   uh... what is it, cindy.  if you know something, but you don't want to be a tattle, but it's very important that you tell someone...  cindy, let's talk about it tomorrow.  but jan could be dead by then.  what..  oops.  why would jan run away like this.  maybe we were thinking too much aboutourproblems and not enough about the kids.  did anyone say anything what we usually say to her.  kids: yeah.  i'll get alice.  oh.  hi, folks.  sam, what are you doing here.  oh, i was just, um, delivering some meat.  well, it's a good thing you're here.  jan ran away, and we need you and alice to help find her.  we'll circle the block.  you check the school.  come on, gang, let's go.  let's go.  come on, everybody, hurry up.  come on.  come on, cindy.  i call the way back.  i got the backseat.  what happened. did an animal die on your head.   hey, lose the hat.  you'll be okay.  mike: keep your eyes peeled, everybody.  breaker, onenine, breaker, onenine, this is christmas carol.  honey, no one's answered us in years.  oh, mike, i have to try.  breaker, onenine, do you read me.  anyone out there.  i need a 20 on a little girl.  blond, blueeyed, answers to the name of jan.  tell her...  mother hen and father goose love her very much.  come after me if you're out there, over.  huh. sounds like some family misses somebody they love very much.  i don't have a family.  oh, no family.  you know, sometimes i'm driving the graveyard shift in the middle of nowhere, i can't help thinking what might have been if i'd taken a different roadmarried young, had a familythree boys, three girls.  oh, then a little voice says, "are you kidding.  they'd probably just treat you like a maid." do you want some of this, jan.  no, thanks.  you have a little voice, too.  mmm. oh, honey, when you're on the road as long as i am, you got to talk to somebody.  that's a trick i learned growing up.  it's tough being a middle child.  you're a middle child.  so am i.  ah. well, then you know what it feels like not being special.  what does she mean, "i'm not special." hey, she's just trying to help.  my family's not much.  no kids, though we do have a lot of livestock.  : jan. oh, jan.  don't listen to her.  in this day and age, if you're lucky enough...  who is that.  : it's methe new jan brady.  let's knock over a 7eleven.  stop. you're scaring me.  me, too. me, too.  mom. dad.  hi. i'm back.  marcia. cindy.  are you up there.  greg. peter. bobby.  alice.  sam.   woman: christmas carol, this is schultzy, come back to me.  schultzy. ththis is christmas carol.  i got a 20 on a little girl.  blue eyes, blonde hair, answers to the name of jan.   i just dropped her off at 4222 clinton way.  thank you, schultzy, thank you and god bless.  over.  that's a big tenfour.    jan. jan.  jan, are you here.  mom. dad.  oh, honey.  oh, honey.  oh, sweetheart.  i'm so glad you're safe.  oh, honey, what on earth made you run away.  i thought no one wanted me here anymore, but when i was out in the real world, i realized thatiwanted me to be here.  you're all a part of me and i'm a part of you, and there's no escaping that...  but it makes me feel really special.  i couldn't have put it better myself, jan, but i'll try anyway.  see, i've always believed that it doesn't matter where your home is, because home is where your heart is, and we may lose this house, but we'll always have our family because we're bradys, and this family is our home.  that's why we'll always have our home.  as long as we have our family, even if we lose our house, we're still bradys.  your father's right.   oh, yeah, absolutely, dad.  marcia: maybe we can still save the house.  how about jan's idea of the "search for the stars" contest.  jan's idea.  yes, it was jan's, and it's a really great plan.  carol: what's "search for the stars." it's a contest for the best musical group, and there's a first prize of $20,000.  and singing one of greg's songs, we're sure to win.  well, then, you're going to have to sing it without me.  huh. what. why.  i thought i could change my name and my personality and become some big, flashy rock star, but i was just kidding myself.  nobody liked my act.  i guess i juston't have what it takes.  well, let's face it, johnny bravo's nothing but...  johnny rotten.  you're right, son.  johnny bravo doesn't have what it takes...  but greg brady does.  he has us, and this family can accomplish anything.  alone, we can only move buckets, but if we work together, we can drain rivers.  your father's right.  the eight of us separate are just eight...  well, with alice, we're nine, but nine...  yes, well, technically...  and with sam, ten, but ten separate, just ten.  together...  we're a bunch.  kids: yeah. the brady bunch.  mike: what do you say, greg.  please.  well, what are we waiting for.  grab some costumes.  we've got to make that

with is me, 'cause our house is more important than money.  this neighborhood is more important than money.  tell me, how many times have we borrowed each other's power tools or patched up each other's kids.  we know so much about each other.  i know that every january, mr. yeager's going to have that big super bowl party at his house.  yeah.  we know every spring mrs. simmons is going to

knew about that.  mike: call me oldfashioned, but these things are important and they're not for sale.  this is our neighborhood...  and we're staying.  now, this is going to sound crazy...  but
