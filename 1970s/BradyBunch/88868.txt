fight with tommy huxley.  tommy huxley.  he's twice as big as you are.  why doesn't he pick on somebody his own size.  well... i picked on him.  you started the fight.  why.  well, he was acting like a big shot.  oh.  well, uh, you weren't by any chance feeling like a little shot, were you.  well, i am a little shot.  that's all i'll ever be.  oh, bobby... listen, you've heard about napoleon bonaparte, haven't you.  yeah. he's that funny guy that always walked around with his hand on his stomach.  well, he was also a little guy, and he went around trying to prove how big he was by fighting everybody.  did he win.  nope.  just like you, he got clobbered.  so ii really don't think that fighting is the answer.  do you, bob.  not if you lose.  some of the greatest men in the world were small men who didn't fight.  what did they do.  they used their brains, not their muscles.  brainpower.  i'll get some more cold water.  brainpower, huh.  you want to shoot a few baskets.  i can't.  what are all the big books for.  to read.  i know that, you dumbhead.  where'd you get them.  at the library.  i'm on my way to brainpower.  brainpower.  what do you mean.  if you had any, you'd know.  jan, marcia, you like to watch tv.  mmhmm.  bet you don't even know how it works.  bobby...  television is an electronic system of transmitting images over wire by converting light and sound into electrical waves.  i bet you don't know what the fourthlongest river in the world is.  no. what is the fourthlongest river in the wld.  the ob in siberia.  it's 3,200 miles long.  well, that's very interesting.  like i was saying, dad, there's nothing like surfing in the whole world.  first, you take off on a big thick swell, and once you got it you crank on a bottom turn, you get out on the nose...  oh, that sounds exciting.  hey, greg, i bet you don't know...  wow, i'm gonna be late for work.  i got to get down to sam's quick.  dad, i'll clean this up when i get back.  oh, gosh, i got to go, too. goodbye, bob.  hey, i thought you'd gone with your mom and the rest to get new shoes.  i don't need new shoes.  not even my feet are growing bigger.  hey, bobby, dodo you have any more of those terrific brainpower questions.  no.  well, you sure had some real hard ones.  big deal.  knowing a lot is great, but it sure isn't very fun.  well, bobby, could be you've been working too hard on one thing.  what do you mean.  well, you need a balance. it's like a recipe.  you've got to have the right amount of each ingredient for it to come out right.  and i've been putting in too much brainpower.  exactly.  oh, and speaking of recipes, there's something wrong with my brainpower.  i forgot to get sausage for my special meat loaf tonight.  better call greg to bring home two pounds of sausage.  i can do it for you, alice.  oh, thanks, honey. it's easier for greg to bring it.  you probably think i'm too little to go down there by myself.  on second thought, since i'm going out tonight the sooner i get my sausage, the sooner i'll get my sam.  okay, go, bobby.  great. i'll get back real fast.  and the porterhouse and the veal go to mrs. stevens at 231 elm.  you got that.  got it.  anything else.  yeah, don't get lost.  i'm closing the shop at 6:00 sharp tonight.  i'm taking alice to the destruction derby.  last timewealmost got destroyed trying to find seats.  hey, sam, if you want to get an early start, i could close up.  switch. hey, that's a good idea.  i could make your deliveries on the way home.  we'll swap, and you close up.  do you think you can handle it. easy.  i take any phone orders that come in...  right.  i put the meat in the locker so i can clean the counters, turn the lights out and lock the door at 6:00.   that's right.  andremember what i told you about that meat locker, right.  right.  and thanks again for the advance, sam.  ah... someday i'll let you ride my surfboard.  no, thanks.  i get seasick taking a bath.  hi, bobby.  what are you doing here.  alice needs two pounds of sausage.  okay. i put all the meat away.  i'll have to get it out of the locker.   what did you do that for.  do what.  close the door.  it doesn't have a twoway lock.  i didn't want to let the cold out.  bobby, sam's got a rule: this door's supposed to be open when anybody's in here.  you mean we're locked in.  unless we can get this door open.  push.  it's no use.  we can't get out.  i'm freezing.  look, you're not freezing.  it's not that cold in here.  if you want to keep warm, exercise.  must be ten below in here.  oh, it's ten below in your head.  bobby, i said exercise, not jump around like you had ants in your pants.   the air.  what air.  we'll be breathing it all up pretty soon.  we'll suffocate.  : i can feel it already.  bobby, quit pretending like this is a submarine movie.  just sit down and relax.  look.  maybe we can open the door with this.  stand back.  stand back.  oh, great.  don't worry, don't worry.  ii've got another idea.  what are you going to do.  just watch.  help me.  come on.  push.  stand back, bobby.  this is our last chance.  push over those boxes.  here.  now if i could just crawl through and open the door...   it's no use.  i'm too big.   it's up to you to save us, bobby.  i sure hope i'm small enough.  gee, i never thought i'd ever wish i was little.  easy does it.   i got your feet.  be careful.  hold on, hold on.  greg: go on.  bobby: i made it.  okay, open the door.  come on, bobby.  you broke it when you hit it with the ax.  oh, no...  call sam, quick.  he's over at our house picking up alice.  i don't have a dime.  wait a minute.  boy, that's an awful cold dime.  if you think the dime's cold, how do you think i feel.   hey, greg, you ought to keep your head sticking out.  it's nice and warm out here.  we'll have you out in a second, son.  i'm okay.  sam, your meat locker works great.  oh, greg, how do you feel.   fine.  careful. okay, that's it.  open it... oh, thank goodness.  thank heaven. you okay.  oh, i think he's all right, honey.  i feel like a side of beef.  well, we got to get you home and into a hot tub.  i had to go and forget sausage.  boy, that settles it.  no matter what it costs )
