brady.  yeah. i guess carol could sew a button.  sure, she can.  i'll bet she's a heck of a good button seweroner.  carol.  .  you shouldn't have taken it.  i don't take your stuff.  i had to have a glove.  i couldn't find mine.  i bet you took it.  i never touched it.  you got the pocket in the wrong place.  what's up, men.  he took my glove.  now the pocket's messed up.  where's my glove. you took it.  i did not.  somebody took it.  don't look at me.  all right.  tell him not to get into my stuff.  make him give it back.  hold on.  i have no time to referee your arguments.  go in the house, both of you, and talk to your mother.  she doesn't know anything about our fights.  she raised three girls.  she knows plenty about fights.  i'm sorry, fellows.  i got no time.  now go.  she'll give you a fair deal.  go on.  i left my glove right here and when i came back, it was gone.  so he took mine.  you took mine.  you say that once more and i'll pop you one.  wait a minute.  let me get this straight.  ..  i didn't lose it. he took it.  i warned you.  maybe someone else took it.  like who.  who'd be the last person you'd suspect.  you.  i thought baseball season was over.  come here.

oh, better than that.  the ice is melting.  the boys are coming to me with their problems.  my boys know a good thing when they see it.  for the first time, they asked for me.  and you even asked me to sew on that button.  oh, yeah, well.  for the first time i felt like a mother and a wife.  i nearly cried.  well, i told you things would smooth out.  oh, i know, but it happened so suddenly.  ..  hi, alice. hi, greg.  seen mom.  yeah. she's upstairs.  anything i can do.  i got a hangup on my math assignment.  maybe i can help.  that's okay.  mom's a whiz at this.  she helped me twice this week.  i'm pretty good at math myself.  thanks, but it's pretty tricky.  mom explains it great.   hello, stokey.  good morning, alice.  let me carry this in.  package for the brady boys.  say, i'll bet that's that giant telescope kit they sent away for.  greg. peter. bobby.  boy, we've been waiting for this.  we. are you in on this deal, too.  well, i helped them send away for it.  i'm sort of a livein scoutmaster.  i go along with the boys on their projects.  well, lots of luck with the telescope and give my regards to jupiter.  thanks. i will.  hey, boys. the telescope is here.  yahoo. it's here.  oh, man, look at the size of that box.  bobby, look what we got.  let's open it up and see what it looks like.  let's show it to mom. come on.  i thought it would never come.  peter: hey, mom, look what we got.  bobby: mom, we got a telescope.  greg: it's finally here.  hi, alice.  oh, hi, mr. brady.   how did it go today.  okay.  good.  brady, if you're not busy tonight if i might speak to you and mrs. brady.  sure. anything wrong.  just something i'd like to talk to you about.  sure. we'll, uh, do it this evening.  yeah.  alice, uh, are you all right.  i'm fine.  noisy, but fine.   it's not that i have any complaints.  some of the happiest moments of my life have been spent right here in this house.  alice, you're beating around the bush.  now, what's bugging you.  ..  ..  well, i felt something's been bothering you the last two days.  is it the girls.  oh, no. oh, no. they're dolls.  ..  well, you see, i have this aunt of mine.  your aunt.  yeah. my uncle's wife.  and she's getting along in years.  and now she's developed this ailment in her liver.  or her kidney.  one of those things in there.  you never mentioned an aunt.  where does she live.  ..  seattle is where she lives.  that's where my uncle lives, too.  and she's been going downhill, oh, real fast.   and she asked me if i couldn't come and be with her.  what could i say.  what with her going downhill like that.  alice, i'm sorry about your aunt.  why didn't you tell me.  well, auntie doesn't like her liver spread around.  alice, are you saying you're leaving.  oh, i wouldn't put it that way, mr. brady.  it's just that my aunt really needs me ..  ..  ..  like you said, i'm leaving.  i understand how you feel but why make it so permanent.  take a week or two off.  ..  i don't think so. no.  when she goes downhill, she just picks up speed.  i've just got to go and be with her.  i hate to see you leave, alice.  you've been here with me and the boys for a long time.  ..  four months, 13 days and 9 hours.  oh, it'll be a terrible shock to the boys.  oh, they'll be fine.  they have you and the girls, and you're a family now.  so if it's okay i'll plan to leave tomorrow night.  take the plane south.  south. to seattle.  oh, uh, well, thatthat's the way that the planes go.  i mean, they head south when they take off before they turn around and go north.  kosher beef only uses the finest

me.  why don't you two knock it off.  we're big guys now not little kids like when she first came here.  we got to act grown up.  i'm going to miss her, too.  you guys asleep.  no.  we couldn't sleep either.  we were all talking.  about alice.  we don't want to talk about it.  ..  i don't care.  you don't have to get nasty about it.  yeah.  girls, i think i understand this.  the boys have known alice a lot longer than we have.  now come on.  it's just not going to be the same without alice.  well, we can't make her stay.  abraham lincoln put a stop to that.  i talked my fool head off trying to convince her.  and she decided so suddenly.  yeah, i can't figure it out.  well, good night, honey.  good night, dear.  mike.  what.  you don't believe that story about her aunt any more than i do.  we've got to find out the truth.  what do you want to do.  put her under a bright light.  we'll talk about it in the morning.  okay.  good night.  mike.  now what.  does it seem strange she never mentioned an aunt in seattle.  no, not especially.  i have an aunt in albuquerque and i never mentioned it.  now please, could we get some sleep.  okay.  good night.  good night. love you.  carol.  what.  when we got married i doubled the size of the family.  alice has twice as much cooking, laundry and cleaning and i never offered her a raise.  i got to give her more money.  even if it hurts.  yeah, that's the answer.  nothing could be farther from the truth.  alice, you deserve a raise.  mr. brady, it's not the money.  what is it.  it's like i said, it's my aunt in sacramento.  sacramento.  if i'd known i was going to draw such a big crowd i'd have sold tickets.  you really leaving.  afraid so, peter.  marcia and jan and me were just starting to love you.  i'm going to miss all you kids.  if you're going to miss us, why are you going.  well, because i have to.  who said.  mom told you, dummy.  she's got to go to seattle.   hello.  alice.  just a minute. i'll call her.  alice.  coming.  excuse me.  oh. thanks.  hello. this is alice.  oh, hi, myrtle.  yeah, it's true, myrt, i'm leaving.  i was just in my room packing.  plans. no i haven't got any plans yet.  why.  things have kind of changed around here, myrt.  brady's married i'm just not necessary anymore.  yeah, who needs an old victrola when stereo comes in.  what's going on.  i found out why alice is leaving.  jan and i were in the back when alice was on the phone.  we couldn't help hearing.  marcia, you shouldn't eavesdrop.  it isn't nice.  it's bad manners.  ..  well, come on, what'd she say.  ..  carol, are you sure she said that.  you know that story about her aunt in seattle.  she made the whole thing up because she thinks we don't need her.  now look, carol, take her aside and explain to her that we do need her.  write it in big letters on the wall.  telling her won't do any good.  she'll think we're just being kind.  we have to show her.  whatever we do, we have to do it fast.  00 tonight she'll be on a plane for sacramento seattle, saskatchewan or siberia for all we know.  now, do we all understand the plan.  yeah. my part's easy. i know what to do.  so do i.  good.  aren't you going to ask mommy.  oh, i what to do, sweetie.  then we're all set.  operation alice is underway.   alice, what are you doing.  you're supposed to be packing.  that's all done.  i just thought i'd get this kitchen organized.  that's very thoughtful but go rest up for your trip.  brady and i have to go out to a formal dinner tonightone of those big precocious affairs.  who's going to feed the kids.  i'll fix dinner.  don't worry about that.  mom, i'm late for my club meeting and i'm going to bring the cake.  we can go right now.  the car's out front.  what about dinner for the kids.  oh, i'll fix that when i get back.  now, alice, you relax.  hey, you forgot the cake.  hold it.  wait a minute.  you show up without this cake and you'll be out of the club.  thanks, alice. you're a big help.  mike: carol. i looked all over.  where's my tuxedo.  isn't it in the closet.  mike: no.  i'll take care of it. thanks, alice.  it's right next to your dark blue suit, mr.  brady.  oh, yeah. thanks, alice.

get showered and i'll get dinner started for the kids.  alice.  alice isn't at your beck and call.  she's getting ready to leave. what is it.  tiger's run away. i can't find him anywhere.  look, we're getting ready to go out.  i can't stop to chase that hound.  you get dressed. i'll find the dog.  he's probably after that cute poodle next door again.  you're taking the day off.  where's greg.  he's over at gordy's house.  he needs a ride home.  oh, brother.  cindy: alice.  bobby: alice.  kids, be patient. the dog will be back.  it's not tiger. she took my checkers.  they'remycheckers.  they're mine. thx are not.  hold it. hold it.  what are you doing.  eating.  we'll eat after you characters clear out of here so that i can get dinner started.  out, out, out. everybody out.   and hold it down.  why don't you let me feed the kids.  alice, you shouldn't even be in the kitchen.  i've been lots of places i wasn't supposed to be.  that outfit does not go with chili burgers.  mike: alice.  where's my black tie.  it's in the second drawer from the top.  i've looked there.  all right, i'll come find it.   brady residence.  you've got to be kidding. who is it.  greg's at gordy's house and he wants a ride home.  we'll pick you up when we take alice to the airport.  mom. hold on a minute, greg.  how's marcia going to get home.  .. oh.  greg, are you still there.  jan, wash for dinner.  greg, we'll pick you up when we pick marcia up just stay put.  will you please help me with dinner.  mike: alice.  as soon as i find a black tie.  ..  how do i look.  darling, you're beautiful.  bobby: dad. dad. dad.  don't let him touch me.  out, out, out.  oh. oh.  oh, your tuxedo.  you're a mess.  oh, brother. oh.  oh, that's terrible.  well, alice, it's too bad all the happy years you've been with us had to end this way.  i guess seattle must look pretty good by now.  brady, if it's all right with you and brady i think i'd like to postpone seattle for a while.  alice, can you.  i think so, mr. brady.  that would be wonderful.  but what about downhill auntie.  i hear she's perking up.  oh, alice.  i just had a thought.  since you two have to leave the house now to make this act look legitimate why don't you two go out to supper and have some fun.  you mean you knew we were acting.  there go our oscars.  well, i'll tell you when you had to go out formal and the kids had to be fed and the dog got lost and marcia needed a ride to the club and then greg needed a ride home and the black tie got misplaced i was suspicious.  but when bobby and peter ran in and splattered mud on your tuxedo i knew i was being hustled.  we were just trying to prove something to you.  if you go to all that trouble to make me feel wanted you really got to mean it.  ..  you know we sure, i'll stay.  alice, you're marvelous.  absolutely the greatest.  oh, honey.  stop it. you're embarrassing her.  are you kidding. i love it.  go on, you can think of some more.  sensational. unforgettable.  terrific.  kids, she's going to stay.   good morning, alice.  good morning, mr. brady.  good morning, alice. morning, mrs. brady.  alice, would you pick up my gray suit at the cleaners.  yes, sir.
