"and dad doesn't even play golf every weekend "  come in.  marcia.  hi, dad.  marcia, did you finish those chores i gave you.  no, sir, not yet.  i thought i made myself very clear.  i was working on something else first.  homework.  no, sir, not homework.  well, what then.  i'd rather not say.  oh.  it's personal, daddy.  those chores were your punishment.  unless you can explain why you ignored them i'm going to have to be more severe.  but i can't explain, not now.  very well, then.  i'm grounding you for one week.  no playground, no friend's house when you come home, come to your room.  ..  and no arguments about it.  "even when he punishes me, it's because i deserve it.  " .. oh, no.  boys. is there anything boys can't wear out.  snow.  snow wears out.  they call it slush.  huh.  no, honey, i was just reading about snow up in the mountains.  let's go skiing this weekend.  hey, that's a great idea.  the kids will love it.  oops, i forgotmarsha's grounded.   oh, mike.  mike, marcia would rather ski than eat.  well, i could suspend her sentence for the weekend.  what do you think.  i think you're an old softy.  oh, no, no, i'm a young softy.   mmhmm.  mike.  jan.  jan.  jan, where's marcia.  i don't know.  here i am, mommy.  marcia, what on earth.  where were you.  mailing a letter.  at this hour.  ..  you could have broken your neck.  i had to mail the letter.  carol: why.  i can't say.   marcia, i've given you every chance possible.  now you've left me with no alternative.  we're all going skiing this weekend.  all except you.  your father's right.  you'll just have to stay with your grandparents.  now, come on, get into bed.  hurry up.  good night, sweetheart.  good night.  and no more going out the window.  ..  as judges of this year's "father of the year" contest we face a very difficult decision.  we have never had so many entries and we have never read such marvelous essays yet somehow, we must make a decision by tomorrow.  we have narrowed it down to those three.  right. but there can be only one winner.  we'll simply have to read these and reread them until we can arrive at a final selection.  then one of these young people will soon be a very happy boyor girl, as the case may be: david wood, arnold collins, marcia brady.  why not join us, alice.  my upper half wants to but my bottom half disagrees.  thanks, anyway.  what's wrong.  the children gave alice her first skiing lesson today.  you flunked.  i prefer to think of it as proving a scientific theory.  everything that goes up sure as heck comes down.  seeing alice on skis is going to be worth the entire trip.  yeah. i'd rather see marcia on skis.  now, darling, we've been over that several times now.  rules are rules.  maybe we ought to bend them just this once.  i want marcia to go just as badly as you do but she broke the rules.  and it wouldn't be fair to the other children who didn't break the rules.  yeah. i guess you're right.  now, remember, cindy let's try to cheer up marcia.  and whatever you do don't mention the ski trip.  hi, marcia.  : hi.  we came to cheer you up.  uh, you want to play some checkers.  no, thanks.  uh, it's real nice weather out.  i suppose.  too bad you're not going skiing.  you know who's got the biggest mouth in the whole wide world next to you.  who.  nobody.  jan, where's cindy.  outside in the backyard.  good.  look, marcia, i'm taking my camera along on the ski trip so you get to see everything that happens even if you can't go.  i'm sorry i'm not going but if you knew the reason it's worth it.  golly, you must have some reason.  i've got a real big secret but if i don't tell someone soon i'm simply going to bust.  you mean, youwant to tell someone.  i don't want to, i have to.  how about me.  i wish i could but can you keep a real secret an honesttogoodness, nevertellalivingsoul secret.  you know me, marcia.  that's what worries me.  please, i can keep a secret.  do you swear. i swear.  do you double swear.  i double swear.  i triple swear.  .. fourple swear.  that's quadruple swear.  okay, i quadruple swear.  ..  no, i don't think i can trust you.  after i sweared and everything.  all right. i'll trust you.  the real reason i was writing that letter and the reason i sneaked out to ..  yeah.  hey, what's going on.  marcia's telling me a secret.  will you get out of here.  i want to hear it, too.  uhuh. no way.  i can keep a secret good as anybody.  oh, no, you can't.  remember when i borrowed mother's perfume.  you told her.  she was going to ask me anyway.  marcia, i'm dying.  i'm dying, i got to know that secret.  well, you girls guessed it about felix brown.  i was writing the letter and i had to mail it by midnight or he wouldn't get it in time.  in time for what.  in time to invite me to the class dance.  have you girls seen peter.  we haven't seen him.  i sure hope he didn't hear the secret.  did you hear the secret, greg.  what secret.  about felix brown.  go ahead.  tell him all about felix brown.  see if i care.  mrs. michael brady.  yes.  lance pierce.  i phoned you earlier.  oh, yes, you're from the local tv station.  ktry. may i bring my crew in now.  oh, i'm just dying to know what the award for mr. brady is.  is it the creative institute of architects.  i'm sorry, we can't say.  we want that moment of surprise from the whole family on film.  okay, boys.  i'll get the children ready.  mr. brady should be home in half an hour.  set it up right over here.  right there.  which side do you think is my best side.  i don't think it makes any difference.  greg: he's driving in he's driving in.  pierce: everybody take your places.  like i told you.  ...  oh, thank goodness.  mr. samuels, i'll cue you.  pick him up at the door and pan him right over here.  everybody ready.  beautiful.  what the devil's going on here.  mike, you came in a back door.  why me.  .  what is this.  .. it's a surprise, dear.  quick, swing everything over there.  alice: come on, come over here.  okay, mr. samuels.  brady, i am hamilton samuels publisher of thedaily chronicle.  and it is my pleasure to announce that you have been chosen "father of the " father of the year.  samuels: we receive thousands of entries and the judges decided that the best came from your daughter marcia.  marcia.  ...  that letter you had to mail was that all part of this.  perhaps you'd like to see the letter she wrote.  we've been conducting this contest for many years and we have never read a tribute like that.  "even though he has only been my dad "for a short time "no father could be a realer father " oh, isn't this a marvelous picture.  yeah, not bad. not bad.  oh, mike, i'm so proud of you.  and i'm so proud of marcia, too.  well, you should be. she's your daughter.  she's whose daughter. )
