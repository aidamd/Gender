no wonder buddy hinton acts like that.  his father is twice as bad.  what happened.  he couldn't care less if his son beats up people or teases little girls.  that's fine with him.  oh, mike, he couldn't be that unconcerned.  from now on, peter has my permission to defend himself.  you want the two boys to fight.  no, honey, i don't want them to fight, but if buddy pushes peter around, then he doesn't have to stand there like a... a... a sitting duck.  stand there like a sitting duck.  sit there like a sitting duck. what's the difference.  from now on, peter can defend himself.  you're as bad as mr. hinton.  where are you going.  to talk to mrs. hinton.  what good will that do.  you men are always fighting.  it's your male ego.  women are different.  we'll just sit calmly and work everything out.  you'll see.  you are so right, mrs. brady.  i couldn't agree with you more.  oh, i knew you would, mrs. hinton.  i'm sure we can settle this little misunderstanding very simply.  how would we do that.  you could just talk to your husband about your son.  oh, i couldn't do that.  why not.  well, that's man's business.  if i poke my nose in that, ralph would be terribly upset.  you won't talk to your husband.  ralph has very strong opinions about raising boys.  yes, i'm aware of that.  if i try to talk to him about buddy, he tells me, "buzz off." and, of course, i buzz off.  well, um, mrs. hinton...  whatever ralph thinks is fine with me.  surely you must have feelings on the matter, mrs. hinton.  oh, i listen to ralph.  and i think you'd be welladvised to listen to what ralph has to say, too, mrs. brady.  frankly, i don't care what ralph has to say, mrs. hinton.  carol's inner voice: "women are different.  we'll sit calmly and work everything out." oh, shut up.  hey.  you're right, mike.  you're absolutely right.  from now on, if peter has to, then let him defend himself.  didn't you have your womantowoman talk with mrs. hinton.  oh, i tried, but she's as bad as her husband.  i take it negotiations fell through.  negotiations. i was the only one negotiating.  it was absolutely terribleralph this, ralph that.  she couldn't say honey, listen...  one thing for herself. wait a minute.  i'll negotiate with you anytime.  i can't understand her being that dependent on him.  pow. right in the kisser.  that's what i'd do to buddy hinton.  too bad mom and dad are patching things up.  yeah, buddy needs a good licking.  might stop him from being such a bully.  you sure you could lick him.  are you kidding.  last time, he gave you a black eye.  that was just a lucky punch.  how many punches did he throw.  one.  boy, how lucky can you get.  twist and roll, twist and roll.  boomboomboom.  boom, buddy hinton.  if i could get another crack at him, i'd wipe him out.  hi, fellas.  hey, pete's just showing us how he's going to take buddy hinton.  pete could wipe him out.  that's what i'm here to talk about.  your mother and i haven't been able to get very far with buddy's parents and, well, if buddy starts a fight again, i think you have the right to defend yourself.  hurray. that's great.  greg: hey, that's great, pete.  you're going to get your big ch...  i want you to try to reason with him.  if that doesn't work, and he starts something, well...  that's different.  what's the matter, pete.  uh, listen...  you fellas excuse me for a minute.  i want to talk to peter alone and make sure he understands.  oh, dad, come on. come on, bobby.  well, i just thought maybe you might have, uh...  something you want to talk to me about.  go on. you can talk.  guess not.  huh. nothing.  you know, dad, i guess i really...  i guess i really am a...  a coward.  why.  you mean because you're a little bit frightened.  aw...  the bravest men in the world get frightened.  heroes get frightened, peter.  honest.  why, sure, they do.  you know, standing up for what you believe is right, and knowing you may have to defend it...  well, that can scare anybody.  adults included.  there's something else, dad.  i'm really not a very good fighter.  i've never been in a real fight.  well, that's nothing to be ashamed of.  you get out of here.  there comes a time, peter, when you have to learn to defend yourself.  could you teach me.  yes. yes, i...  well, i could, if you want me to.  yes, please.  all right, okay, look.  from now on...  from now on, you're in training.  and, in a couple of weeks, buddy hinton won't be able to lay a glove on you.  you think so.  i'm positive.  what if buddy starts training, too.   that's it, peter. jab and move.  jab and move.  it's not working.  every time i jab, he moves.  and every time i move, he jabs.  don't get discouraged. it takes practice.  it might help if peter kept his eyes open.   can i play, too.  it's not a game.  we skip rope in gym class all the time.  cinderella dressed in yellow went upstairs to kiss a fellow.  how many kisses did she get.  one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight...   keep moving.  at all times, it's important to keep moving.  it's difficult to hit a moving target.  rememb that.  you watching. you watching.   now, look. this is called the old buzz saw defense.  don't tell me you never saw that before.  never.  the trick is... trick is...  you get their attention on this fist, and then...  see. like that.  watch. got it. okay.  keep moving.  get their attention on this hand...     that's it, petey, you got it.  that's great, pete.  yeah, you got it now.  keep your chin tucked in.  jab, jab, cross.  cross with the left.  yeah. yeah.  keep moving.   seven silver swans swam silently seaward.  seven silver swans swam silently seaward.  seven silver swans...  are you going to the kitchen again.  all this training makes me hungry.  oh, peter.  yeah.  you don't have to fight buddy hinton for me.  i'm not afraid of his teasing anymore.  how come.  i've been practicing.  now i speak really swell.  well, don't worry.  if he starts any trouble, i can handle him.  are you sure.  sure, i'm sure.  i think.  why are all these kids following us for.  they don't walk home this way.  i guess they wanted to watch.  watch what.  the fight.  how do they know there might be a fight.  i guess maybe i mentioned it.  aw, cindy.  well, if it isn't baby talk and the chicken again.  hey, chicken, let's hear you cackle.  let's not start this again, buddy.  i want to hear you cackle, chicken. come on.   that's dumb.  cut out all the teasing.  hey, baby talk.  ittybitty itsybitsy baby talk.  cut it out.  what are you going to do about it.  let's reason. talk about it.  shut up or fight.  don't you want to talk about it.  you heard me. shut up or fight.  okay, if that's the way you want it.  i'm ready.  you asked for it.  gee, buddy, i'm sorry.  i didn't mean to hurt you. really, i didn't.  gee, you knocked my tooth loose.  i did what.  : it's looth.  see how it wiggles.  cindy: you sure talk funny.   stop it.  it's not funny.  baby talk, baby talk.  it's a wonder you can walk.   don't do that.  it's not funny.  go on. get out of here.  why shouldn't we tease him.  for the same reason you didn't like him teasing you.  i guess you're right.
