all right, dear, but...   how do you do.  please to sit down.  i would introduce myself, but everyone knows who beebe gallini is.  even people on the street come up to me and say, "it's beebe." and i always say to them, "hello, my dahling." this is dwayne, my secretary.  oh, uh, how do you do, mr.....  not necessary.  please sit down.  darling, you are going to design my new factory, and it will...  factory.  please, not to interrupt.  it's not nice.  i have just finished arrangements with the president of your company to build a beautiful new factory for the beebe gallini cosmetics company.  you want me to design your factory.  please wait. don't interrupt.  you're just like my second husband.  or was it my third.  your fourth.  oh. i knew it was one of them.  miss gallini...  beebe.  everyone calls me beebe.  people who have never even heard of me call me beebe.  beebe, i'm very flattered.  oh, no false modesty.  i do not believe in false modesty.  i am beautiful, so i say i am beautiful.  you are talented, no.  well, um...  uh... uh... yes. i...  good.  that is what the people tell me.  that is why you must design my new factory, and i give you complete freedom.  design, design, design.  anything you want.  anything.  yes, only one thing that i ask is that it should be pink.  pink factory.  beebe pink.  that is what i call my cosmetics because i am pink.  you see the pink.  yes.  let your imagination run wild.  create whatever you wish.  but make it pink.  yes.  my phone number.  my personal private phone number.  give it to him.  oh, thank you.  i will see you soon, no.  uh, no. yes.  oh, uh...  hurry, dahling.  we cannot keep the jeweler waiting.  i promised him faithfully i'd be there yesterday.  thanks for helping me tonight, dear.  no. it's my pleasure, sweetheart.  you know, when alice asked me if she could leave early so she could to the movies with her boyfriend, sam, how could i refuse.  hmm.  what's up.  hmm. what what's up.  well, ever since you got home, you seem... preoccupied.  preoccupied.  oh, don't be silly, honey.  it's just... well...  preoccupation.  preoccupation.  yeah.  i got this new client today and i have to design a factory.  and it's sort of a special factory and it takes a lot of thought.  what kind of special factory.  well, the client is very eccentric, and, uh...  could you say "strange woman".  yeah, yeah, she's a... a woman.  aha, then a strange woman did enter your life today.  oh, that astrology nonsense.  yeah, that astrology nonsense.  yeah, it's silly and stupid and foolish.  and what kind of strange woman.  oh, honey, when a client walks into my office with an offer to design a factory that's worth a whole lot of money, it doesn't make any difference whether it's a man or a woman, even if it is beebe gallini.  beebe gallini.  is she the strange woman who came into your life.  she didn't come into my life, she came into my office, that's all.  that's enough.  they say no man can resist her.  well, i can resist her.  are you sure.  i am absolutely positive.  oh... oh, mike. oh.   i think that's plenty of food, mr. brady.  mm, i don't know, alice.  four fishermen get mighty hungry, you know.  that's right. a couple of hours out on that water makes them awful hungry.  makes me awful seasick.  isn't it funny how some people get seasick and some people don't.  i think i'm allergic to waves.  even when i take a bath, i have to be careful not to move around too much.  i'll hurry the boys up.   i'll get it.  hello.  yes, this is the brady residence.  one moment, please.  i'll get him.  it's someone who calls me "dahling" and "vants" to speak to you.  hello, miss gallini.  beebe.  : beebe..  this afternoon.  but...  yeah, but...  i was going fishing today and...  yes, i know you have a contract with my firm, but...  i'd promised my boys that i was...  all right.  yeah. no. all right, i'll be there.  bye.  you'll be where.  oh, beebe wants to see me again.  she's got some new ideas for her factory.  but it's saturday, and the boys have been looking forward to that fishing trip.  oh, i know.  hey, maybe alice could go.  she can't. she gets seasick.  wait.  i've got it.  i'll take the boys fishing and alice can take the girls riding.  okay. problem solved.  hey, you're an angel, you know that.  i thought you...  yeah, i know what you thought.  you thought i was going to be jealous.  yeah, i did.  just because she's rich and famous and beautiful and i must be some kind of a nut.  you'll be okay, mom.  oh, boys, you're rocking the boat.  stop weaving.  mrs. brady, what happened.  oh, i got seasick and... and sunburned and...  and then i got caught on somebody else's line and...  and then i fell into a pile of fish.  no wonder you smell like tuna, mrs. brady.  i wouldn't gloat if i were you, alice.  you smell a little bit like man o' war.  oh, will somebody please stop rocking this house.  oh, i think i'd better go straight up to bed.  don't you want any dinner.  dinner.  alice...  please, don't even mention food.  hi, honey.  you still up, sweetheart.  that's funny.  what's funny.  i smell fish.  well, i can't help it.  i've already taken three showers.  i smell pink.  yeah, well, you can smell pink, too.  beebe gave me some samples.  samples of what.  her cosmetics.  her apartment's full of them.  her apartment.  yeah. she uses it as an office.  she hates her factory, and she won't work in it, so that's why i'm designing a new factory. hmm...  hey, hey, hey, where's that angel of a wife i left this morning.  she went fishing and she got seasick and sunburned and caught on someone else's hook and fell in a pile of fish.  you had a rough day on the boat, huh.  mmm.  honey, why don't you use some of beebe's cologne.  there's a whole box of it over there.  i'd rather smell like fish.  lively score yes.  kids never get this excited about cleaning teeth.  you want a greenies.  but dogs do.  watch them go wild for an

yes, the charity.  when i appear, i want that the orchestra should play something pink.  well, then something that sounds pink.  charities, banquets.  it is always something.  now, michael, dahling you will show me my sketches, hmm.  i finished these at home late last night.  oh, no.  no. no, dahling.  beebe, a factory has to be functional.  functional. oh, that is one thing that beebe does not want to be, functional.  beebe wants to be beebe.  naturally, a building has to express the personality of its owner, but...  exactly what i'm saying.  express my personality.  yeah, but, you see, you didn't let me finish my sentence.  a factory has to be practical and efficient. there are a thous...  a powder puff.  make the factory the shape of a powder puff.  a powder puff.  or maybe tall like a lipstick.  : a lipstick.  all right, michael, make it the shape of a powder puff.  with beebe, you have complete freedom.  now, you will make me a sketch, huh.   oh, no. that must be for me, dahling.  i've had my calls transferred here.  yes, this is beebe gallini, incorporated.  i love being incorporated.  uh, miss gallini, it's marie of marie's cosmetics.  oh.  her i do not wish to speak to.  hang up.  loudly.  of course.  well, michael, dahling, are you finished.  no, dahling.  fluffier.  fluffier. it has to be fluffier.  fluffier.  my factory has to be fluffy.  a fluffy factory.  but little red riding hood was too smart.  she knew that wasn't her...  grandmother.  right.  she knew it was a big wolf.  a big, pink, female wolf.  i've never seen a pink wolf, mommy.  well, let's hope you never do, dear.  oh, my goodness, it's 8:30way past your bedtime.  daddy stays up late, too, doesn't he.  your daddy is working very hard these days...  and nights.  peter: mom...  i can't make my airplane fly straight.  is dad home yet.  no, dear. he's working late.  we don't hardly ever get to see him anymore.  well, i've explained it to you before, dear.  your father has a very complicated jobdesigning a factory where they make perfume, powder and lipstick.  aw, who needs all that junk anyway.  us women, that's who.  why don't you two just run along and finish your homework, okay.  hi, mom.  is dad here.  no, he's not here yet.  go on upstairs.  i'll be up in a minute to help you.  mom, marcia and i are looking for dad.  he's not he.  now, come on. everybody to your rooms.  it's time for bed.  bed..  bed.  at 8:30.  well, you've been staying up too late.  another wasted evening with that hokey cosmetic queen.  changes, changes, more changes, more interruptions.  i tell you, if that factory didn't mean so much to my company...  is it worth it, mike.  well, honey, it might be rough on me if i lose the contract.  but what good is it. what good is the money if you have to work all the time.  she's got to make a decision soon.  yes, but what if she doesn't make a decision soon.  you can't keep working day and night.  that's my job.  what about the kids' education.  what about providing for their future.  what about us today.  tomorrow it's saturday and...  no, honey, listen...  beebe has to go to some charity thing, and i'll make it up to the kids and to you.  i'll do everything, i promise you.  in one day.  have i been away that much.  very much that much.  the wing was too far back, pete.  that's why it didn't fly straight.  thanks, dad.  i'll bet it'll really go great now.   carol: is that the door.  i'll get it.  i'll get it, honey.  oh, now, mike.  hold on.  hello, beebe.  hello, michael, dahling.  this must be the little woman.  oh, i forgot.  you haven't met.  carol, this is beebe gallini.  beebe, this is my wife, carol.  i'm very happy to know you.  of course.  oh, what a charming little cottage.  is this your guest house.  uh, yeah, this is our nineroom guest house.  beebe, listen, i thought you were going to that charity affair today.  oh, i'm on my way, dahling.  but as i was driving, a... a vision came to me.  you've changed your mind about the powder puff.  you guessed it.  you have such a talented husband, dahling.  beebe, i've been working all week on that powder puff design.  this is much better.  a compact.  a compact.  the top floor opens up.  there has never been another factory like it.  yeah, that's for sure.  beebe, that's impossible.  oh, i think it's a marvelous idea.  a topless factory.  with a stationary bottom.  a factory like that will make you famous.  everyone will talk about you.  oh, they'll talk about me, all right.  look, beebe, the whole project is impossible from an engineering standpoint.  the leverage, the stress.  i'd sure hate to be standing next to the water cooler when the top went up.  you can't hinge a roof.  you can understand that.  oh, details, details, details.  beebe gallini is not interested in details.  now, dahling, you will start work on the new design at once.  oh.   my head. my hair.  my airplane.  we're sorry about, this, miss gallini.  good. it's not broken.  peter, will you apologize to miss gallini.  for what.  ah, apologies i do not need.  three hours it takes to fix my hair for the charity ball.  bang. bang. you're all wet.  i'll get you wetter.  bobby...  i'll get you.  oh.  sorry, lady.  i was aiming at her.  michael, are these creatures yours.  bobby, cindy, out.  mommy, she cries black tears.  oh, kids, out.  oh, i'm terribly sorry, miss gallini.  sorry does not help.  but they didn't mean any harm.  neither did frankenstein.  beebe, i apologize. the whole thing is...  i'm sorry, michael, but i'm afraid i have to get another architect.  goodbye.  and goodbye to you, little woman.  well, there goes beebe gallini in a cloud of feathers.  oh, mike.  what about your company.  haven't you lost the contract for them.  oh, honey.  that's the wrong way to look at it.  i haven't lost them a contract.  i've saved them a nervous breakdown.  .  it's time to bring it out in the open.  it's time to drop your pants for underwareness, a cause

lungs and become an even bigger problem.  and that i had to take action.  so he talked to me about xarelto.   xarelto is the first oral prescription blood thinner proven to treat and help prevent dvt and pe that doesn't require regular blood monitoring or changes to your diet.   for a prior dvt i took warfarin, which required routine blood testing and dietary restrictions.  not this time.     while i was taking xarelto, i still had to stop racing, but i didn't have to deal with that blood monitoring routine.     you made great time.  i found another way.   don't stop taking xarelto, rivaroxaban, unless your doctor tells you to.  while taking xarelto, you may bruise more easily and it may take longer for bleeding to stop.  xarelto may increase your risk of bleeding if you take certain medicines.  xarelto can cause serious bleeding, and in rare cases, may be fatal.  get help right away if you develop unexpected bleeding, unusual bruising, or tingling.  if you have had spinal anesthesia while on xarelto, watch for back pain or any nerve or muscle related signs or symptoms.  do not take xarelto if you have an artificial heart valve or abnormal bleeding.  tell your doctor beforalplanned medical or dental procedures.  before starting xarelto, tell your doctor about any conditions such as kidney, liver, or bleeding problems.  xarelto is proven to reduce the risk of dvt and pe.  with xarelto thereis no regular blood monitoring and no knowndietary restrictions.  treatment with xarelto was the right move for me.   ask your doctor about xarelto today.  for more
