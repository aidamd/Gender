i didn't hear anything either one of you said.  that's the third time i've heard it, and i still can't figure it out.  bobby.  greg's going to the movies to see two neat pictures, and he won't take me.  i've got a date with a new girl, and i don't want the allamerican kid tagging along.  our bet was that the loser has to do everything the winner tells himeverything.  i've done everything else, but dates are different.  greg, if i remember correctly, the bet did include everything.  oh, wownot dates.  well, look, greg, it may seem a little rough, but when you make a bet, you have to be prepared to pay off.  okay, maybe next time you'll remember no bet is a sure thing.  i'll remember, all right.  okay, okay, i'll just call off the date.  it's okay with me.  i don't care if she comes along or not.  listen, mr. chinup king, i've done everything you've asked fair and square, but there's no wayno way are you going on my date with rachel.   bobby: you're blocking my view.  and i want some more popcorn.  you've already had three bags.  then i want some pizza.  i'll be back in a minute, rachel.  boy, you can really see better from up here.  : uhhuh.  neat movie, isn't it.  yeah, real neat.  having fun, huh.  we're having a ball.  you see. i told greg if i came, you wouldn't mind.  here's the pizza you ordered.  and that's all the food you get.  our bet had nothing to do with my going broke.  greg, wouldn't it be nice if bobby got in the back seat to eat his pizza.  yes, that'd be nice.  okay.   shh.  i didn't do that.  want some pizza.  no.  how about you, rachel.  it'srealgoodpepperoni and onions.  no. no, thank you.  you guys don't know what you're missing.  we know what we're missing.  you're blocking my view again.  come on, bobby, stop fooling around.

might rain.  well, if it might rain, then i'm putting the top back up.   now you've done it.  wait till dad sees this.  well, i didn't know anybody there, but i really had a good time tonight.  yeah,
