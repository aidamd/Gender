   what are you dng i was watching a movie.  jan, we want to watch the ball game.  yeah, you can watch a movie any old time.  i want to see this movie.  come on.   that's your fault.  you broke it.  you made me.  now we're going to miss the ball game.   okay.  everybody, please.  now, what's the problem.  i'll tell you what the problem is: you have to wait in line for everything here.  someone's always borrowing your things.  i never have any privacy because i have too many brother siers.  i wish i were an only child.  .  . oh lolli lolli lolli .  . lollipop .   . baaoom, boom, boom .   treat

well, i wish they didn't.  i'm tired of getting pushed around.  you're not getting pushed around.  when you live in a large family you have to learn to give and take a little bit.  my friend donna doesn't have any of these problems.  but does she have any brothers and sisters.  no, and she couldn't be happier.  she doesn't have to wait for the phone or the bathroom or anything.  she has all the privacy she wants.  now, just a minute, there are two sidetoha donna also doesn't have anyone to help her with her homework or to play or to go places with.  well, that sounds great.  what's good for one person isn't always good for another.  listen, i think you ought to consider yourself a very lucky young lady.  hear, hear.  mom, donna invited me to spend saturday night at her house.  okay.  saturday night.  you know that's the night of the square dance.  we're going to be a square.  well, couldn't alice take my part.  well, yes, i suppose she could but it wouldn't be the same without you, honey.  we're going as a family.  that's what i mean.  donna doesn't have to do family things.  sometimes i wish i didn't have any brothers or sisters.  then i could do what i wanted without anybody to bug me.  hi, alice.  hi.  hey, there's one left.  oh. bobby, you come back here.  ..  yeah, bobby, you come back here.  why am i hollering for bobby to come back here.  because he just took my apple.  oh, if that's all that's bothering you, no problem.  well, that was the last apple, alice.  ..  .. is the last apple.  you're something else, alice, thanks.  carol: alice.  mr. brady's driving me to the market.  i thought we finished the shopping.  oh, but this is for something special.  es for the hoedown.  you did.  yeah.  something wrong.  no, no, it's just i was going to make strawberry preserves.  mine are from my grandmother's secret recipe, alicewon four blue ribbons with it.  must have been really something.  my aunt's secret recipe won six ribbons.  look, alice, why can't we both make preserves.  i mean, there's no contest between us, right.  right.  i'll go pick up those things.  ..  what's in your aunt's secret recipe.  oh, i guess most of the same things that are in your grandmother's secret recipe.  bye.  bye.  these sacks will be great for the potatosack race at the hoedown.  .. don't you think we'd better clean them out first.  naw, we'll just jump the dust out of them.  hi. hi, mom, hi, dad.  hi.  what are you doing.  have you got a problem.  no, we're just getting the sacks ready for the race.  wait till you see what we got for the square dance.  look here.  think the rain's gonna hurt the rhubarb.  no, but i sure hope it kills the corn.  it should be a lot of fun saturday night.  i hope jan changes her mind and decides to come with us.  don't worry if she doesn't.  jan's going through a phase.  she's thinks she doesn't have any privacy.  we all treat each other the same.  she has as much privacy as the rest of us.  well, be a little considerate of her.  okay, we'll try and take kindly to the critter.  yes, sir, we'll try.   the reason i called, amy is that groovy red hair and mysterious green eyes really turn me on.  it's greg brady.  you remember, i talked to you in schoesterday about the charity hoedown saturday night.  ..  oh, it never fails.  someone's always on the phone when you want to use it.  ..  jan, if you need it, i'll let you on the phone.  listen, amy, can i call you back later.  okay, goodbye.  here you are, jan, it's all yours.  gee, thanks.  75, 80, 90, 95.  i've got 95 cents, how much you got.  i go60 cents.  ..  that's a $1.55.  hey, that's more than we need.  what is this big financial transaction.  we finally got enough money to buy a trick rope for the square dance.  don't forget, 95 cents of that rope's mine.  you only get to use 60 cents' worth.  okay, i'll take 30 cents' worth on each end.  now, i don't understand that, but it sounds mighty shrewd.  look, alice, isn't that a pretty bracelet.  it's absolutely free.  well, you'd better read that small print and see how free that "free" is.  well, you do have to subscribe 50 and as usual i'm broke.  think we ought to lend jan the money.  are you nuts.  what for.  to be considerate, like mom and dad said.  look, she did a lot of nice things for you.  like what.  well, like she helped you with your homework.  homework's one thing, money's another.  well, i'm going to lend her my money.  there goes the rope trick.  you can put your money back in your bank or you can be a nice guy.  what a rotten choice.  hey, jan, how'd you like to get that money for your bracelet.  would i.  but it's only a loan.  what's the catch.  just pay it back whenever you can.  don't rush.  we're just trying to help you, that's all.  gee, thanks.  that was a very nice gesture, fellows.  you deserve to have something nice done for you.  how about giving us $1.55.  come on.  alice, would you like to see what's in my recipe.  i mean, i really have no secrets.  no, i know you don't, mrs. brady.  i wouldn't want my recipe to be a secret either.  alice, could i borrow some of the sugar, please.  oh, sure.  thanks.  hmm, very interesting.  one cup of sugar to threequarters of a cup of fruit.  oh, is that what i used.  mmm.  three dashes, huh.  oh, well, who counts.  i think mine's ready to boil.  mine, too.  hey, what's cooking.  oh, hi, honey.  alice and i are making strawberry preserves.  brady and i areboth making preserves for the auction.  which do you think looks the best.  what is thisa contest.  ..  we were just curious.  just to satisfy my own curiosity i came in about my overalls.  either these things were made for paul bunyon or two guys to wear at the same time.  ouch.  oh, honey, i'm sorry.  look, just stay still, okay.  could you use shorter pins.  well, try not to move.  how that's for length, mr. brady.  .. ow.  mike, i told you not to move.  leave the length to me.  i'll make sure they're high enough to show your purple, checkered socks.  get a tourniquet, i'm bleeding to death.  alice, have you seen my magazine.  isn't that it.  oh, yes, thank you.  reckon i'd better go get myself some more pins.  okay, now just stand still like that.  jan, would you like to try on your dress for the square dance.  well, i promised donna that i'd spend saturday night with her.  ou go another night.  i guess.  i'll have to think about it.  what are you doing.  standing still.   .. you can use the stairs if you want to.  i'll wait till later.  cindy, what's going on around here.  i was just trying to be considerate.  everybody is.  how come everybody's so nice to me.  because you're supposed to be.  what do you mean.  we're supposed to be nice to you until you get over your problem.  then we can forget about you again.  sothat'sit.  ..  jan: greg, bobby, peter.  bobby: what does she want.  greg: what's going on.  marcia, come in here.  i want to talk to you.  greg: jan, what's this about.  just cut out the special treatment.  cindy told me everything.  well, not everything.  just what i wasn't supposed to.  you're a bunch of fakes.  what do you mean.  i don't need your help or your special treatment.  jan, take it easy.  i don't need you for brothers and sisters.  see, never lend a relative money.  who asked you to do it.  if i were an only child i wouldn't have any phony brothers and sisters.  who needs you.  you mean that, jan.  you're right, i sure do.  well, if that's what you want i'm sure it could be arranged.  you just lost yourself five brothers and sisters.  and you can have the whole house.  great.  for us, too.  as far as you're concerned we don't even exist.  consider us invisible.  let's disappear.  yeah, let's go.  bobby: let's disappear.  why are we leaving for.  yeah, this isourroom.  g.  a short time ago, this woman suffered from limited mobility.  a month ago this man wasn't even able to get around his house.  these are people who

family practicing for that corny square dance.   i think that's enough for tonight.  as they say down on the farm, pappy's pooped.   do you mind.  i'd like to go upstairs.  don't mind us.  we're invisible, remember.   now, what was that all about.  uh, we made a deal with her.  she wants to be an only child.  so, what's the deal.  that's the way she wants it.  when she's around, we don't exist.  we're invisible.  uhoh, mike, what do you think.  well, i think it's better if the kids sometimes work out things for themselves.  if that's the kind of medicine jan wants she's about to get a big dose of it.  well, here we go.  see you later, mom.  where are you going.  to the library.  be back by 1:00.  alice doesn't serve lunch all day.  hey. just a minute, you.  what are you doing.  that's my sweater.  i always borrow your sweater.  well, you no longer have a sister named marcia and there's no marcia's sweater.  okay, kids, okay.  mom, we made a deal, remember.  yes, i remember.  and i'm sticking to it.  jan, do you want to stick to it.  yes.  finei'll just take my invisible sweater .. vanish.  that's not fair.  i'm afraid it is, honey.  you can't have it both ways.  so long.  finished your second hamburger already, partner.  yep.  for a little varmint you got the fastest mouth in the west.  i'm sorry i'm late, alice.  guess bobby ate the last hamburger.  ah, remember, honey.  i came from a large family myself and it teaches you to be ready for any emergency.  thisis the last hamburger.  thank you, alice.  now, i can't tell you where i got them stashed but in case you need them i also have the last pear, peach and banana.  okay, pass the potato chips, bobby.  i said, pass the potato chips.  alice, will you pass what'shername the potato chips.  your arms suddenly got short.  well, you see, i'm not here.  you're not here.  that's right.  jan, are you here.  of course i'm here.  you're here but he isn't.  that's right.  hi, alice.  how about you, greg.  how about me, what.  are you here.  he isn't here either.  that's right.  will somebody please tell me what's not going on around here.  i guess we should have filled you in, alice.  sit down and i'll explain.  before i sit down, tell me one thing.  what.  is that chair here.    right in the face.  i wonder what kind of pie that was.  wasn't that funny, pete.   isn't that terrific the way they can make those dogs do those backflips.  i wonder how they do that.  isn't that cute, cindy.  mike: hi, honey, i'm home.  we're in here, mike.  hey, i do believe i've died and gone to strawberry heaven.  you want a taste.  sure.  okay.  mmm, fantastic.  well, that's grandma's old recipe for you.  try mine, mr. brady.  yeah.  alice, that's out of this world.  good old aunt millie.  do you think alice's tastes better.  well, i didn't say that, honey.  you mean mrs. brady's tastes better.  i didn't say that either.  what do you say.  tell it like it is, mr. brady.  ..  yes.  let me put it this way.  yes.  i don't want to scrub the kitchen or sleep in the den.  i ain't saying.  chicken.  .. go.  go, cindy, come on.  come on, bobby.  hi, dad.  hi, honey.  mind if i watch.  no.  not if you find supermarkets interesting.  i'm crazy about supermarkets.  wouldn't you rather be doing something more interesting.  uhuhthis is very interesting.  i think the kids are out back practicing the sack race.  i know.  looks dull.   besides, they probably wouldn't want me out there anyway.  well, you know, sweetheart sometimes when you make a deal that turns out badly the best thing to do is to get out of it.  did they say it was a bad deal.  no, , no, but you never know.  sometimes when you find it's turned out badly there's every chance that they think it has, too, huh.  i don't know.  ohcome on, come on.  you think about it, hmm.  okay.  okay.  yeah.  go get 'em.  the boys against the girls.  wait, wait, wait.  cindy can't hop as far.  yeah, i have shorter legs.   come on, cindy.  we'll team up and beat them.  i'll be the lineman.  bobby.  greg: i'm going to start right away.  ..  go.   look out.  no.  move it, jan.  no.  move it.  run along, miss only child.  well, if i'm an only child, this is my backyard.   all right.  i'll get out of your way on a couple of conditions.  what.  that you let me in the race.  yeah.  and that you promise to be my brothers and sisters again.  are you sure that's what you want, jan.  positive.  once you've been pushed around by brothers and sisters like you you sure do miss it.  nice to have you back.  greg: hey, jan, grab a sack.  i'll be your partner.  waomething.  i'll be right back.  hey, where are you going, honey.  to call donna to tell her i can't stay over because i'm going to the hoedown.  oh, that's terrific.  hey, is it okay if i invite donna to come with us.  sure, that's a good idea.  good, then she won't be an only child either.  greg: y, alice.  why don't you fill in for jan.  i need a partner.  oh, nono, thanks.  oh,
