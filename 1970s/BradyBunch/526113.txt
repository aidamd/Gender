 now, i think if we can just shorten these sleeves a bit that'll eliminate the rips.  this was greg's.  oh, i know, dear, but it'll look beautiful.  it'll still be greg's.  no, it won'tit'll be yours.  wait till you see what your mother does with it.  in the store, everything's new.  in the store, everything costs money.  hey, wait till you see how i fix the knees of peter's pantsleather patches, just like hunters wear.  they'll still be handmedowns.  oh, is that what's stuck in your craw.  maybe.  what's a craw.  it's just an expression.  " they'll look brandnew, bobby.  how come greg and peter aren't here getting handmedowns.  they're over at gordy's house.  they didn't even say goodbye.  well, you were watching television with cindy.  they could have said goodbye during the commercial.  you're right, sweetheart.  they should have said goodbye.  hey, how about trying on these pants with this shirt, okay.  go ahead.  i wonder why bobby seems so upset this evening.  well, maybe something okay, which one of marcia's sweaters do i end up with this year.  give her my blue one.  your blue one's faded.  we'll dip itpeacock blue.  it'll be gorgeous.  swell.  give her my green one.  i'll keep the blue one.  you girls let your mother work it out.  how about yours, mom.  when will i start getting your sweaters.  oh, a little later, dearafter you've filled out a bit.  mother, may i remind you there's a male in the room.  oh, i didn't hear a word you said.  then how come you answered.  kids these days ar after we finish, can we go to the movies with nancy and carla dittmeyer.  their dad will go there and pick them up and then drive them home.  well, i suppose so.  itisfriday night.  okay, dear.  what kind of movie.

you're too young to stay up so late.  when you're older.  besides, we couldn't take you looking like that.  jan: of course notwho'd look at the screen.   hey, those pants are great.  i don't need this mop if you promise to slide around the floor for a while.  you're making fun of me, too.  i wouldn't make fun of you.  i was just kidding.  i didn't think that was funny.  well, even bob hope misses once in a while.  just a minute, sweetie.  what's the matter.  i got something in my craw.  your craw.  well, that's what dad says.  well, whatever it is, you can tell me.  after all, i've known you since the day you were born.  say, that's right, alice.  you're my real housekeeper and you're only a stephousekeeper to them.  hmm.  the girlsyou're their stephousekeeper and nobody likes steps as good as they like the real ones.  you're coming through, but it's not making much sense.  it's like stepmothersthey like their own kids better than steps don't they.  where'd you ever get an idea like that.  a stepmother can love her new children just as much as she does her own.  so can stephousekeepers.  ..  cinderella's stepmother was real mean.  i saw it on television with my own eyes.  and you think that's what's been bothering bobby.  well, he told me he'd seencinderella on television tonight.  he's all shook up about stepmothers.  oh, but that's silly, alice.  bobby knows i love him.  brady, you know kids get the strangest ideas in their heads.  anyone would think you'd asked him to sweep out the fireplace lately.  ..  ..  is that meeting very important tonight.  well, every meeting is important, honey.  more important than bobby.  what kind of a question is that.  honey, please be late for the meeting.  what's this all about.  i know what's bothering bobby.  what's more, i think i have a solution to the problem.  how does it affect my meeting.  i want you to go to the bicycle shop with me now.  we can give the bike to bobby tonight.  before his birthday.  because of cinderella.  i'll explain on the way.  remember, not a word to anyone.  we'll surprise bobby.  then you'll go on to the meeting.  the heck with the meeting if it's that important to bobby.  want a glass of milk.  nuhuh.  an apple.  uhuh.  what did you look in the refrigerator for.  nothing.  sure is quiet around here.  hey, you know why it's quiet around here.  because there isn't any noise.  nothing like a lack of noise to make it quiet.  did dad go to his meeting.  i don't knowi guess so.  hey, you know what kind of cookies we've got.  your favorite.  ..  where's mom.  you really love these, bobby.  isn't mom here either.  well, she had to go out for a little while.  you mean, nobody's here.  well, what do i look like, the invisible woman.  everybody went out and nobody said goodbye.  well, maybe you were busy when they left.  i wasn't too busy to say goodbye.  that's only one word, or maybe two wordsi keep forgetting.  your mother will be back in a little while.  where did she go.  i don't know exactly.  bobby: come on, tiger.  you're the only one around here who cares about me.  .. come here.  believe me, sweetheart you're getting yourself all upset about nothing.  everybody in this house loves youyour mother, your father your brothers, your sisters and alice.  we all love you.  when everybody leaves and nobody says goodbye that ain't love.  come on, tiger.  you

dad.  if you ask, you're not running away.  yeah.  where you going to go.  ..  not even me.  how long will you be gone.  maybe all my life.  maybe longer.  maybe we ought to tell greg about this.  you said you wouldn't tell anybody.  okay, i won't tell anybody.  i'm sorry.  i won't tell anybody.  won't tell what.  i told you, i can't tell you.  i promised bobby.  the only reason he told me is because i'm his brother.  well, so am i, dummy.  .. that's right.  now, if he can tell you then you can tell me.  bobby's going to run away from home.  run away.  for real.  he's upstairs packing.  for real.  but we can't let him.  how can we stop him if nobody knows.  we'll have to think of something.  ..  ..  ..  hi, alice.  hi, greg.  you kids should have your own supermarket.  .. more milk.  i better start ordering an extra quart.  well, you'll have plenty of milk after tomorrow.  ..  what's that supposed to mean.  oh, nothing.  i have this teeny tiny feeling you're trying not to tell me.  it's a secret.  a secret i can't tell anybody in the world.  well, those are the only kind worth listening toproceed.  sorry, i can't tell you, alice.  not exactly.  beat around the bush a little.  if i figure it out for myself then you're not giving away the secret, right.  right.  one of the kids in this family, who shall be nameless is going to run away from home.  and it's not me or peter or marcia or jan or cindy.  marcia, jan, cindy, greg, peter, bobby.  bobby is going to run away from home.  i didn't sayi was just beating around the bush.  your mom and dad, i've got to tell them.  don't forget, alice, it's a secret.  everybody knows i can't keep a secret.  that's what i was counting on.  i wonder where your folks went.  i'll try the steven's.  well, what do you think, honey.  do you like it.  mmm, yeahespecially the color.  with his eyes.  ..  what kind of extras.  oh, for instance, a license with the kid's name on it.  for a buck.  well, wonderful idea.  that's good.  what's his name.  bobby.  well, thanks anyway, mrs. korngold.  i thought they might have gone to your place for a bit.  i'll try the merediths.  bye.  salesman: is it a beaut or is it a beaut.  i'd say it's a beaut.  now the only thing left are sideview mirrors.  sideview mirrors.  that'll complete the picture.  believe me, folks a kid who gets a bike like this will go absolutely wild.  take my word.  whoever gives it to him will win him over for life.  win him over.  ..  i know exactly what you're thinking.  this is bribery.  exactly.  we can't give that bike to bobby now.  maybe later for his birthday but not to win his love.  let's go.  hheywhat about the bike.  hold it for us.  we'll be back in about a month.  the name is brady.  bye, and thanks for those magic words.  magic words.  hello, mrs. feiffer, this is alice.  are mr. and mrs. brady there.  oh, they didn't tell me where they were going.  i wanted to ask them something.  thanks all the same.  is bobby still packing.  he just switched to a bigger suitcase.  ne.  try to keep an eye on him.  i got to find your folks.   thank heavens, they're home.  you two wait here.  if somebody has to squeal it will be me.  thanks, alice.  hi, mr. and mrs. brady.  hi, alice.  hi, everything all right.  everything's fine with one tiny exception.  something's wrong.  ..  but what.  one of your little chickadees is about to fly the coop.  ...  ..  bobby.  without mentioning any names, yes.  ..  where's bobby now.  according to reliable sources he's upstairs packing.  i've been phoning you all over town.  thanks, alice.  i think we better go right up to him.  let's be careful how we handle this.  i think you ought to talk to him first.  and then.  i have an idea.  as soon as i get settled somewhere, i'll send for you.  i'd like to take you now, tiger, but i can't carry all this and hold on to your leash, too.   hi, bobby.  .. hi, dad.  am i interrupting something.  in a way.  before you got back i wanted to be gone.  gone.  you're going somewhere, are you.  ..  i'm kind of running away.  ..  ..  why.  lots of reasons.  i'd tell you, but it's getting late and i'd better be going.  don't you like it here anymore.  no, sir, not as much as i used to.  well, don't worry about it.  you know when a person isn't happy where he is he has every right to look for a place where he can be happier.  you know what beats me is how very wrong we were.  ..  and we thought you loved us, too.  oh, i do.  ..  well, i better be going.  ..  .. give you a hand.  you're going to let me go.  yeah.  well, if that's what you really want.  what about money.  i got $9.86.  .. a lot of famous men started out with less than that.  of course, you'll get more when you go to work.  work.  you can't keep running all the time.  you're going to have to stop and go to work.  what can you do, bob.  ..  i can fingerpaint and glue things.  well, i guess with that kind of experience you can find an opening someplace.  lots of luck.  i thought you'd be mad.  would you want me to stay around if i didn't want to.  you have to.  you're the father.  that's very true but i don't want any son of mine staying when he doesn't want to.  bye, dad.  i'll walk you down.  goodbye, son.  goodbye, dad.  ..  i heard you were leaving.  yeah.  well, why don't you let me take the big suitcase and you can carry mine.  where are you going.  well, i'm not going to let you go away alone.  that's a big world out there.  i'm going with you.  what about the others.  you're going to leave them.  your father can take care of them .. you don't want me to go with you.  mom, would you really go with me.  really, bobby.  nobody said goodbye to me or anything and i didn't think anybody cared.  oh, sweetheart, everybody cares.  and i'll bet you your baseball cards you can't guess who cares the most.  you.  even though i'm only a step.  listen, the only steps in this house are thosethe ones that lead up to your bedroom.  so how about marching right back up there.  hey, dad.  mom and me are back home again.  good, because that's where you both belong.  older, to i'm more active, i eat right, and i switched to newone a day women's active metabolism.  a complete women'smultivitamin plus more for metabolism support.  and that's a changei feel good about.  new from one a day.  isn't it wonderful, mike.  talk about a happy ending.  yeah, bobby went to sleep as happy as a bird.  darn that cinderella anyway.  you know that's what started all the trouble.  maybe we should write a nasty letter to the fairytale control board.  well, thank goodness the other fairy tales aren't like that.   good night, dear.  good night, honey.  mommy, daddy.  cindy, what's wrong.  what's the matter, sweetheart.  it's henry.  henry.  that bullfrog i found today.  i've kissed him twice already and he still hasn't changed into a prince.  he's just a plain old bullfrog.  ..   announcer: previously on "high school reunion": wake up, cow bitches.  announcer: two bad boys from a rival high school crash the reunion.  marcel: i came to the reunion looking to wreak havoc and steal all the women.  announcer: and the summer girls strutted their stuff.  time has been good to these ladies.  who needs porno when you have the summer girls.  since high school, i've lost some weight, and i think that lori found it.  announcer: and when the valley boys took rachelle and elena ..  rachelle: in high school, you know, i stayed with the same guy, so i missed a lot of opportunities and i don't want to miss out again.  announcer: joe the football star was filled with jealousy.  i'm not worried about her, i'm worried about him.  joe: marcel has got some style, he does.  i'm kinda concerned that he might threaten my status with rachelle.  announcer: when lori the party girl met her secret admirer mark, another romance blossomed.  lori: i still can't even believe it happened, that someone that sweet can, after 20 years, say that he has a crush on me.  announcer: cyndi the nerd called out the ladies' man.  you're a really great guy.  thank you.  your girlfriend has a really good catch, but you should've put a ring on her.  announcer: will antanus ever be ready to settle down.  and when john said ..  my bat's comin', .  ...the class of '89 united to confront the troublemaker.  you really don't even realize how ignorant you sound.  so stick it in your ass.  announcer: and tonight, the tension in the house boils over.  don't you sit there, you little pompous bitch with your hat on, and act like an arrogant .  i think johnny uses that language because he's ignorant.  i thought it was just time for somebody to talk to him and try to put him in his place.  announcer: and then joe and rachelle fall deeper in love.  i'm really having a good time with you.  i feel like i'm 16.  yeah, i didn't feel this good even when i was 16.  it is definitely hard to keep my hands and lips off of joe right now.  announcer: and two new classmates join the reunion.  we're here to help him make a life decision.  we really want him to propose to his girl, lakoiya.  announcer: and for antanus the ladies' man, a shocking new surprise gift sets in motion a lifechanging decision.  antanus: when i saw tracy pull out the ring, a chill went through my body.  your girlfriend's waitin' for you down that hill.  antanus: i was excited in one hand, and in another hand i was torn, because i'm happy to see her, but i have this ring in my hand, and i'm like, "  announcer: and then john the troublemaker is up to his old tricks.  if you don't like me, go yourself.  i don't care.  he was trying to defend what he said.  announcer: will one new classmate finally stop john's shocking behavior.  well, i can't tolerate it, because if he called me one, if he called my wife one, you know, i can't do that.  treda:oh, lord.  antanus:uhoh.  announcer: it's all coming up right now " .  . i can't believe that it's true .  . hey, just how high .  . or just how low.  .  . people remember your name .  . what happened to you. .  . some things have changed .  . some stay the same .  .  .  . people remember your name .  . i can't believe that it's true .  . some things have changed, some stayed the same .  .  yeah, my boys call each other that all day long.  it doesn't mean it's right.  you shouldn't saybut no, it was not directed at any person, was it.  am i right.  joe, am i right.  no, you're wrong.  no, it wasn't directed at anybody.  it was directed at marcel.  marcel was upstairs pouring water on me, rachelle, ..  oh.  ..and then ..  whatever.  eric: i was hanging out in the kitchen, and all of a sudden we hear that he's using the "n" word.  instantly, my blood pressure just rises, because i knew john obviously had a problem with gay people, but this is ridiculous lissette: it's not how you view it, it's how other people around you might view it.  well, yeah because you got to be politically perfect, and that's exactly what it is.  joe: you're missing the point.  no.  yes, you are.  lissette:it's about having class.  john, can you please listen.  john:no. no.  no, because you know what, this is why the world's the way it is.  everybody needs to straighten up and deal with it.  lissette: i agree eric:big time.  lissette:big time.  this is like right on cue.  marcel: yeah, tell me about it.  joe: antanus walked in the house, and i thought, thank godif there's one person in this house )
