 i got seconds on the phone.  after me.  please tell me what's going on.  we're the hottest new singing group in town.  after our audition for hal barton ..  and she turned out to be an agent.  greg:

college.  wherever he goes, the important thing is he gets a good education.  .. that's why i think it would be great if he went to state.  why you would want your son to go to a college that lost 35 football games is a mystery to me.     guys, just relax.  look, if we call right on the dot it's going to make us look anxious.  well, we areanxious.  let me handle it.  peter: get a load of mr. cool.

didn'tthe agent did.  now, try to put yourself in his spot.  what would you have done.  maybe what he did.  ..  no, after all, they didn't want us.  ..  he didn't have any choice.  .. no, you would,

both said i'm an independent guy and should make my own decisions right.  to a degree, yeah.  well, i made a decision about college.  and.  i'm not going.  .. i have an appointment to see my agent
