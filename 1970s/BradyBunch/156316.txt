 the ball carrier's heading straight at you.  always keep your eye on his belt buckle.  why.  that's his center of gravity.  watching his feet or head will fake you out.  let's try again.  okay, you ready.  yeah.   bobby: peter: clobbered him.  what's the matter, greg.  marcia's got to be kidding.  bobby: who is he.  peter: a fink.  how do you know.  he's wearing a fairview sweater.  hi, greg.  thanks for letting me take you home.  thanks for helping with the signs.  can i see you again.  sure.  great.  i'll keep in touch.   i assume you know who he is.  mmhmm, jerry rogers, quarterback and dreamy.  dreamy.  i may even let him take me out.  marcia, are you kidding.  jerry is the opposition.  ..   but he's certainly not mine.   marcia: come in.  i'm in.  hey, those belong to me.  you mean theydid belong to you.  but i'm putting the rest up tomorrow.  we don't need help from a traitor.  traitor.  i'm as loyal to westdale as anybody.  you mean loyal to jerry rogers.  that's ridiculous.  besides, you don't even go to westdale yet.  i will next year.  and when westdale hears my sister's a spy they might not even let me in.  you're impossible.  you should be ashamed of yourself calling marcia a traitor.  you really hurt her feelings.  it serves her right for liking a fairview freak.  jerry doesn't sound like a freak to me.  everyone at fairview is a freak, especially before the big game.  how could you possibly compare a football game to a romance.  you can'tfootball's important.  for your information a football game only lasts 60 minutes but a romance can last a whole month.  at least.  hi, alice. hi, honey.  hi, honey.   uhohremind me we have some unfinished kissing.  hello.  yes, this is the brady residence.  you want to speak to whom.  twinkles.   no, i'm sorry, there's no twinkles here.  uh, yes, there is.   hello.  tank.  : what a surprise.  yes, i'll have to thank ethel for telling you where to find me.  "twinkles".  "tank".  of course i want to see you.  ..  tomorrow at 7:00 would be perfect.  you've got yourself a date.  bye, tank.  how about that.  yeah, how about what.  tank gates.  he's coming to dinner tomorrow.  what is a tank gates.  only the best athlete that westdale high ever produced.  football, basketball, baseball track, everythingyou name it.  his muscles had muscles.  i know the type.  you feed him bananas he'll swing from the trees out back.  right, alice.  i may swing with him.  imagine, hearing from tank gates after all these years.  i bet they named him tank because his head's shaped like a turret.  no, because he mowed down the opposition like one.  oh.  and as for his looks every girl just turned to jelly when he passed by.  including you.  no.  good.  me he didn't pass by.  we sort of went together in my senior year at westdale.  sort of or did.  what's the difference.  .. well, d... there's a great deal of difference because "sort of" means "sort of" "  well, anyway, that was a long time ago.  you're going to love meeting tank tomorrow.  .. sure, i'm just counting the seconds.  you better get another bunch of bananas, alice.  alice, my husband has just paid me a very big compliment.  what's that, mrs. brady.  he's jealous.  oh, bless that greeneyed monster.  i didn't realize that.  young man: hey, jerry.  see you later.  how's it going with that brady chick.  stop worrying, would you.  i won't fumble.  yeah, but the game's this saturday.  we need westdale's play book no later than thursday.  we'll have it sooner.  i'm seeing her this afternoon.  oh, yeah. great.  you're some operator.  take care.  see you in practice.  i was really surprised when you picked me up at school.  what happened to your football practice.  i just ran 90 yards for a touchdown and kept right on going.  don't i get some kind of a reward for driving you home.  well, uh, what did you have in mind.  i'll settle for a cold drink.  : come on in.  hi, kids.  hi.  hi.  this is jerry rogers.  bobby, and this is cindy.  you're right, marcia, he is gorgeous.  i hope westdale whips the pants off you guys saturday.  bobby.  come on, jerry.  let's go into the house.  that wasn't very polite of you.  cindy, he's the opposition.  he's also marcia's friend.  he's a fairview fink.  all you boys think about is football.  love is a lot more important.  how do you know.  you never played either one.   uh, have a seat.  thanks.  um, would you like some lemonade.  great, if it's not too much trouble.  oh, not at all.  i'll be back in a minute.  make yourself at home.  this is a great house you have here.  do all you kids have your own room.  i wish we did.  greg's the only one.  he fixed over the attic for himself.  yeah.  that's a great idea.  i ought to do something like that to our attic.  do you suppose i could take a look at greg's room just to get some ideas.  well, maybe sometime.  great.  be right there.  no rush.  that's the most ridiculous thing.  i'm sorry, but it happens to be true.  jerry rogers wouldn't stoop that low.  all right, why would bobby say it if he didn't see it.  he only thought that he tried to steal it.  he has no proof.  my eyes are my proof.  they saw him try to take it.  you're just prejudiced because he's a great quarterback.  i could be a great quarterback, too if i had the other team's play book.  i believe bobby but i'll give jerry a fair shake.  how.  by giving him another chance to steal my play book.  he didn't try to steal it.  greg: then you don't have to worry.  and if he's innocent, we'll apologize.  right.  okay, it's a deal.  get ready to apologize.  you mean you'd better find a new creep to go out with.  oh, yeah. it takes one to know one.  then you two should be really happy together.   @@@hhh how do you turn a washer into a whole new way to customclean and carefor clothes.  by turning the drumfive different ways.  the headturning,5motion kenmore elite washer.  that's

me a new dress for my birthday.  well, since your birthday's several months away i'd love to.  good, i'm wearing it.  do you like it.  ooh, i like it.  it was on sale.  i like it better.  what's the occasion.  well, honey, you know i needed a new dress ..  that's for tank.  no, silly, it's for you.  yeah, that dress sure makes me look good.  happy birthday, twinkles.  hey, how would you guys like to help me plot "operation wipeout".  operation wipeout.  what do you mean.  i told marcia i'd give jerry another chance to try and steal my play book.  but if he does, fairview will clobber us so i came up with an idea.  two play books.  this one's a phony.  we'll fill it with fake plays.  if jerry steals it, fairview will be running in circles.  right.  you guys would rout them.  can't you see those freaks trying to defend against our plays when they're not our plays.  you read me the plays out of this real play book and i'll switch them right here in this phony one.   twinkles.  no, i'm mike.  right.  i'm dave gates.  glad to meet you.  thank you.  well, carol's told me a lot about you.  aw, not everything, i hope.  where is she.  where's my twinkles.  she's right here.  twinkles.   hi, tank.  come here, you gorgeous hunk of woman.  tank, put me down.  oh, you're as wild as ever.  and you're as pretty as ever.  no, no, you're prettier.  boy, did you luck out, fella.  my mother thinks she didn't do too badly either.  ..  bet you're just dying to know what i've been doing since high school, right.  ..  went right to college and guess who made allamerican.  take a stab in the dark, honey.  you know me, twinkles, i don't like to brag but after college, i went into pro football and made allpro three years in a row.  yes, i noticed it in the paper.  wasn't hard to do, was it.  i was in them all the time.   did you ever play ball, mack.  mikeum, i played some ball, not football, ..  i didn't figure you did.  carol: we have a son who plays football at westdale, tank.  you have a son that old.  why, you look like you could be in high school yourself.   did you hear that, mike, me still in high school.  i heard it.  listen, that's the reason i'm in townfor the biggie between westdale and fairview.  just don't get a chance to get here anymore.  how did we get so lucky this time.  look what i dug up, tank: our oldwestdale annual.  ..   carol:..  son of a gun, here i am scoring a touchdown against fairview that year.  do you remember all those touchdowns i scored, twinkles.  ..  i scored so many points i can't remember the total.  hey. i remember that touchdown now.  let me show you how it worked.  ..  now, this is the picture: we only have time for one play and we're still 75 yards from pay dirt.  fairview's expecting a long pass so they drop back into a fivethreetwoone defense.  so i look over the defense and do you know what play i call.  ..  the old statue of liberty.  yeah, the old statue of liberty play.  but anyway, we break out of the huddle.  i come up to the line.  here, let me show you.  you two be the defensive unit.  yeah, you are a little fragile, aren't you.  right.  jackson, metzger, cyrila rock.  metzger snaps the ball back to lefkowitz.  lefty fades back like he's going to throw a long one and that's when the old tanker comes flying by and grabs the ball.  the crowd went wild.  he gives him a leg.  he takes it away.  he reverses his field and it goes against the grain.  he gives them a right stringer, he gives them a left stringer he was poetry in motion.  and then he runs for the big save.  and the rest is history.  you're a legend in your own time.  no, not yet.  i still have to make the extra point.  ..  i wouldn't want to miss that one.  but i fool them again, see.  i made them think i'm going to run for the extra point.  suddenly i stop, step back and dropkick ..   oh.  sorry, guess i got carried away.  oh, don't worry about it.  just a rare tropical fern.  but you'll be glad to know the drop kick went right through the goal posts.  you're really going to go through with greg's plan.  jerry's on his way over.  what if he does steal greg's play book.  i don't think he will, cindy.  because he's honest or because he told you your eyes are like faye dunaway's.  we'll soon find out.  put them down.  here.  good luck.  okay.  cindy, go on.  what.  cindy.  oh, all right.  hi.  hi.  i'm glad you could come over.  going on between us because i was just going to call you.  : good.  can i get you a cold drink.  sure.  how about some of that great lemonade.  okay.  i guess you're really excited about the big game.  you better believe it.  greg's really up for it, too.  i'll betmeans the league championship.  i hope you won't mind if i root for westdale.  wouldn't have it any other way.  oh, am i a goof artist.  coach called a special session for team photographs.  i completely forgot.  can i take a rain check on that lemonade.  sure.  i hope you understand.  i understand perfectly.   hey, get thisthe paper picks fairview to win by three points.  if they only knew about the phony play book.  hey, boys.  boys: hi, dad.  hey, dad, want to win a bundle.  bet on greg's team to clobber fairview.  yeah, yeah, listen, i hear you pulled a fast one on fairview.  you mean on that freak jerry rogers.  yeah.  mike: no, i mean on fairview.  don't you see you're operating on jerry rogers' level now.  what do you mean.  well, look, he stole your play book and if it had been the real one his team could win dishonestly.  right.  mike: now westdale can win dishonestly because the play book is a fake.  i never thought of it that way.  me either.  ditto.  well, boys, it just seems to me that a victory is only going to mean something if westdale beats fairview in an honest game.  hmm.  and i'll bet your coach would agree, too.   hello.  hi, jerry, greg brady.  .. hi, greg.  what's up.  it's about that play book you swiped.  are you kidding. me swipe your play book.  i'm just trying to do you a favor.  some favor, calling me a crook.  look, man, the book's a phony.  you're the phony, greg.  but thanks for the phone call.   alice, that was the best ball game ever.  westdale killed them.  20 to seven.  marvelous.  bobby: we clobbered them.  marcia: jerry rogers didn't even finish the game.  the coach benched him in the first quarter when he discovered the phony play book.  wait till you see what we're going to have for dessert.  greg: i'm ready for that.  we're going to celebrate the big victory.   oh, alice, that is beautiful.  hey, alice, what if westdale had lost.  carol: there she goes again.  ..  for this.   how do you turn a washer into a whole new way to customclean and carefor clothes.  by turning the drumfive different ways.  the headturning,5motion kenmore elite
