it do. it does this. he points it at piggy's beverage cup, and it vanishes.  and, it does this. he points it at the table, and the cup rematerializes. he drinks piggy's beverage. hey, you. what a wonderful trick. do that again.  hm.  ahh. well, it's very simple, link. you see, this ray dissolves anything i point it at. he points it at link and piggy, who vanish. watch it. don't do that  hah. and, then it will undissolve you thusly. he brings them back.  and there you are.  exactly as we were before.   uh, maybe not exactly.  bu but this is terrible. i can't live my life being you.  ha.

and floyd play "honeysuckle rose", but are bothered by a bee. zoot eventually sucks the bee in through his saxophone, spitting it out at the end of the song. harry and animal perform a callandresponse drum battle. at the end, they both collapse. fozzie, still typing, notices that his tie has gotten stuck in the typewriter. oh, no.  oh, no. oh. this is so embarrassing.  i wonder if this ever happened to neil simon. oh, boy. hey, fozzie. oh. hi. hi, rowlf. how's it going. oh, well, gosh, i, uh... i, uh... um... you're stuck, huh. yeah. listen, it happens to all writers. this does. sure. it's what's called "writer's block". oh. oh, oh, oh, yeah. y'know, where you can't come up with the next line. yes, well, i, uh, i can't come up with the next line. well, maybe i can help. mm. let me see what you last wrote here. rowlf yanks the paper from the typewriter and pulls fozzies tie through with it. the opening montage plays. hello, sports fans. louis kazagger bringing you the wild world of muppet sports. you join us today for the start of the 100meter blindfold sprint. angle on the finalists. and the finalists are on their marks. and they can't see a thing.  not even the starting flag. so, we'll try the pistol. the pig referee fires a pistol, and the runners start running in different directions and knocking each other down. and there they go. and there, and there, and over there. yes, #0  ah.  knocked down by #2. he's up again. #7 looking like a man of action. #0 knocked down again, this time by #6. 0 off to the side, 6 is off. here comes 2 looking very far back, but #7 is quite good. i think he's found it. i think he's found the finish mark. here they come, ladies and gentlemen. #7 detects the finish line and tries to run through it, but ends up getting tangled in the poles. and we have a winner.  and we need a stretcher. two blindfolded medics rush to his aid, but to no avail. uh, uh, back to the regular program. uh  i think that number raises a pertinent question. what's that. why did they do it. they chuckle. fozzie and harry sit in the dressing room. how's the writing going, fozz. oh, boy, i didn't know it would be that tough, harry. well  you know. you write a lot of stuff. no, not really. no  well, i write songs. oh, yeah, they're terrific too. hey  how do you get ideas for all those songs. well, they don't come easily. you have to get inspired. hmm. like the song we're gonna do next. uhhuh. i discovered that song in africa. i was in a county called guinea. and i went deep into the interior of the county, and in a little village i met with a storyteller. african music slowly fades in as the other muppets gather around him. and that storyteller went way back into african tradition, and african mythology, and began to tell this story about the fire  uh huh.  which means the sun, and about the water, and about the earth. and he pointed out that all of these things, put together, turn the world around. and that all of us, we're here for a very, very short time. and in that time that we're here, there really isn't any difference in any of us, if we were to take time out to understand each other. and uh, the question is, do i know who you are. do you know who i am. do we care about each other. 'cause if we do, together we can  turn the world around. four african masked dancers enter to join harry in singing "turn the world around". the muppets join him in the end. well, it  it's been such a great show, that we can hardly bring ourselves to end it. and we all know who we have to thank for that. the scriptwriter. no, no, the guest star, fozzie. and so, thank you from all of us, mr. harry belafonte. applause. this is the greatest group of singers i've ever worked with. to the muppets. night, all. hey, we'll see you next time on the muppet show. harry and the muppets, including statler and waldorf, continue singing the chorus over the credits. ) )
