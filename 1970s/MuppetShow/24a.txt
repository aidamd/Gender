her son charles and her cat cuteypie, was settled today. a special court has ruled charles is the sole heir and he will be awarded the entire estate... ten thousand rubber mice. shot of said object, then of the crew. it's coming straight at us but i can't tell what it is. it looks like the headlight on a motorcycle. we know what it looks like, we want to know what it is. testy, testy, mon capitain. doc, would you look this thing up in your book. strangepork does so. mmhmm. ah, yes, yes.... no, no. it's not listed here under any known objects. look under unknown objects. how could it be in that book if it's unknown. there are some things even pigs don't know. oh, brother. doc, how long before we collide with this thing. exactly 17 hours. good.  now that's the kind of man i like to have on my crew.  ladida. excuse me, captain, it's not exactly 17 hours. no. no. it's 17 seconds. i have trouble with those little decimals. 17 seconds... nice going, doc. prepare for collision. oh.  the pigs go to their seats. cut back to the mysterious object, which is, in fact, gonzo riding on a motorcycle. it... it was a motorcycle. i told you that at the beginning of this dumb sketch. link leaves the bridge. he stands in the doorway. lucky guess. anyway... i got us out of that tight pinch. the doors slam closed on his snout. piggy and strangepork laugh hysterically. stuck pig alarm. stuck pig alarm. tune in next week for last week's chapter of... pigs in space. fozzie is sulking around the backstage door. uh, this is a good place to hide from milton berle.  gee, i never realized how funny he really is, in relation to certain bears i could mention. fozzie lifts up the panel on the door and peeks through. i think i'll just stay here until the end of the show. the panel falls down on his nose. fozzie groans in pain. enter kermit. uh, hey, fozzie, that won't work. we already used that joke on pigs in space. rowlf is softly playing "the entertainer." milton berle enters. the entertainer, right. yep. that's the name of the song. you know, most people don't know that there are words to that song. yeah, that's true. you know what they're about. hmm. they're about... the stars and the performers and the entertainers that appeared during the heyday of vaudeville. hey, you used to be in vaudeville, didn't you. yeah, sure i was, but when i was a kid. yeah. how many performances did you do in vaudeville. oh, i'd say between eighty thousand and one hundred thousand. wow. you were really the entertainer, weren't you. one of them, yeah. one of them. many, many fond memories. milton speaks the lyrics to the song as rowlf continues to play. more muppets join him and pick up the tempo after the first verse. milton finishes the song the way he started it. rowlf is sitting at his piano. piggy enters. rowlfie. would you play that song again for moi. sure. rowlf plays and piggy sings "the entertainer" again, with female pronouns. put somethin' in it, rowlf. piggy dances. she's a born ham. hubba hubba. piggy resumes singing. oh yeah. piggy joins rowlf at the piano. don't hog the piano. piggy splays herself on the keys and shakes her chest. rowlf covers his eyes. piggy gets up to finish the song. makin' the bacon. there we go, bringing home the pork. piggy and rowlf finish the song disheveled and winded. fozzie is wearing a big fake nose and beard. scooter comes by, humming, then turns around when he sees fozzie. what's this. what does it look like, small boy i have never seen before. well, it looks like fozzie bear trying to hide from milton berle. you have penetrated my disguise. fozzie removes his fake nose and sulks to the stairs. oh, fozzie. fozzie, why don't you just go up to milton berle and introduce yourself. oh, i just couldn't do that, scooter. well, i see your point. milton's monologue was terrific. yeah. as a matter of fact, he's much funnier than you are. now if you really want to know the truth... i don't, i don't. what's wrong with oldfashioned lying. oh fozzie, you look upset. i am, scooter. i wish i could go lie down. well, what's stopping you. you're standing on my beard. oh. sorry. scooter steps off. fozzie falls over. aaah. main stage. kermit enters. and now, straight from a threemonth engagement at the desert springs vermont humane society, here is zelda rose and her singing owl. zelda rose and her singing owl perform "who." kermit is at his desk. fozzie pops out from under it. oh, fozzie. shh. yeah, yeah, yeah. hey fozzie, you know, this is your last chance to meet milton berle. kermit, i keep telling you i just can't. i wouldn't know what to say to him. yeah, well, uh, here he comes. oh, oh. i'm gonna hide. please don't tell him where i am. ok, whatever you say. milton enters. fozzie hides behind a basket as kermit and milton talk. hey, kermit, where's fozzie bear. oh, uh, fozzie bear. well, funny you should mention it, he's... where is he. he's, uh... he's in death valley. death valley. yep. death valley. what's he doing in death valley. uh, well, he's, uh... uh, he's, um... gathering material for his act. i've seen his act. he can use it. no, i'm kidding. you know, kermit, i've always wanted to do a song and dance with fozzie bear. fozzie is cowering until this point, at which he immediately pops up and reveals himself. hi there. fozzie. back so soon. uh... yes, kermit. how was death valley. uh... hot. hot, and that's funny. nope. nope, uh, too hot to be funny in death valley. yep, folks, once more the bear talks his way out of things.  fozzie starts to go after kermit, but milton gets his attention. yes sir, yes sir. i was just telling kermit that i've always wanted to do a song and dance with you. you. you. a song and dance with me. you, the king of the baggy pants comics. you, the... the...  how about, uh, top banana. what. top banana. listen, mr. berle, if you want me to call you a banana i'll do it. i'll call you a brussels sprout, a plum... whatever, i'll do it. no, no, no, kid. you see, top banana is what they call the head comic back in the days of burlesque. ohh. let me tell you something. fozzie settles in. milton puts an arm around him. are you listening, fozzie. oh, yes yes yes. milton speaks the lyrics of the first verse of "top banana." fozzie listens enrapt. come on, fozzie. follow me, huh. come on. milton leads fozzie to the stage. milton, dressed as a clown, and fozzie sing "top banana," performing vaudeville schtick in the middle. milton enters with a crate. hey, hey, hey, where you going. i'm taking my case to
