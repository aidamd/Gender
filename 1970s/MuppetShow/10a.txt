sings "i got a name" with the muppets. oh, i could listen to her sing till the end of time. she doesn't sing that. not her style. no. no, no, no, i mean i could listen to her sing forever. no, she doesn't sing that either. why don't you just check yourself into the old fools' home while they still have a bed left. kermit goes over the rundown. muppy goes upstairs into his dressing room. kermit,

gentlemen, the great gonzo has dug deep into his limitless repertoire, and has come up with an act the likes of which has never been seen before. so let's give a big hand to the great gonzo. a fanfare plays. gonzo runs onstage holding a balloon. ok, thank you, tonight i present a unique version of "pop goes the weasel"    uh, with a surprise ending. animal runs on stage and pops the balloon. the audience boos. hey, it wasn't my fault. aww, you yokels. i quit. he walks offstage. the audience boos and throws things at animal. gonzo enters the dressing room and bangs his head on the door. lena notices him. gonzo. what's the matter. oh, gee, miss horne. it's really depressing.  you hear them booing out there. sometimes it takes a long time for an artist to be appreciated. but  as long as one person appreciates you, you just gotta keep on trying. and as for me, i think you're fantastic. i don't know what to say. music swells up. well, listen. in this world of ordinary people, extraordinary people, i'm glad there is you. in this world of overrated pleasures, and underrated treasures, i'm glad there is you. i live to love. i love to live with you beside me. this role so new, i'll muddle through with you to guide me. in this world where many, many play at love, and hardly any stay in love, i'm glad there is you. more than ever, i'm glad there is you. they hug. thank you, lena. you're great, gonzo. aww. applause. kermit sits at his desk. scooter approaches. boy, oh, boy. it sure is great being in the show business, chief. yes, scooter, but i tell you, this isn't an easy job. sometimes in this business you have to be ruthless, merciless and cruel. in what way, chief. well, i just cut piggy's song from the show. why. 'cause there's no way she could follow the great lena horne. she'd look ludicrous. yeah. yeah, but these are command decisions, scooter. it's lonely at the top. he's right. yeah. i've gotta be ruthless, merciless and cruel. oh, how kind my kermit is, not wanting me to overshadow lena horne. oh, no, no, no. he cut your number so you wouldn't look ludicrous. what i'm sorry. you see, i've gotta be ruthless, merciless and cruel. she karatechops him. kermit never told me about this part. another karatechop. and now it's time for that riotous, mirthful bundle of laughs, mr. fozzie bear. the curtain opens as fozzie's fanfare plays. mwah. mwah. thank you. oh, boy, oh, boy, what a fantastic audience you are. no, i mean it, i mean it. i've seen audiences come and i've seen 'em go. well, you're seeing 'em go now, right out the door.  says you. that's right. says you. that's right. says you. well, you better have a way out of this. i do, i do. says you. sezu hayakawa. huh. sezu hayakawa, a great japanese actor.  and speaking of japanese actors, did you know "toshiro mifume" means "no smoking" in japanese.  aaaahhh. well, he's either brilliant, or that's the dumbest thing i ever heard. ah, you can't stop the old fozzie tonight. i'm really cooking, i'm one rare bear. aaahhh. you're a square bear that ought to be served medium rare.  and now, my tribute to marcel marceau. an impression of a man balancing himself on one leg. count them. one. here we go.  thank you. no applause. now  now, now, a man balancing himself on no legs.  thank you, i love you. yes, i love you. mwah. oh, i could stay on forever. you stay on any longer, you'll be running into the prayer of the day.  senior citizens, one. bear, zero.  hilda, would you help me find my key to the dressing room. oh, i am so sorry, miss horne. my head is such a pickle. i left the iron on in the costume room. i'll be back in a jiffy. hilda exits. animal walks by with a mallet. animal. animal, i was wondering. would you help me find my key. ah. all right. he whacks her on the foot. she screams. b flat.  let's have the monsters standing by. monsters standing by, please. ahem. aren't, uh, aren't you going to be standing by, too. uh, no. why. because you're the monster. what you said at the beginning of the show, about  about lena and me. i just got it, el greeno. uh, well  yeah  you meant that i couldn't follow her.  well, piggy, sometimes the truth hurts. she karatechops him, then stomps on him and walks off. lena is at the piano with the muppets. rowlf plays. you know, there's a children's tv show that i really enjoy. maybe you've heard of sesame street. the muppets nod. anyway, here's one of my favorite songs from that show. she and the muppets perform "sing". well, that's it for this week's madness. hey, we'd like a special thanks for our special guest star, miss lena horne. yaaay. thank you, kermit, thank you. it was fun. oh, good. uh, i was listening to piggy sing backstage. mmhm. i think she ought to have her own spot on the show. oh, really. well, maybe next time we'll let her sing a song. oh, kermit. you do love me. oh. give your little porker a kiss on the chops. o death, where is thy sting. she showers kermit with kissykissys. lena laughs. eh, see you next time on the muppet show. the muppets gather onstage as the credits roll. waldorf dozes. author, author. is he here. hm. who. arthur. aw, go back to sleep. waldorf dozes. ) )
