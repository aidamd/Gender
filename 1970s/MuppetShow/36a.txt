contents the dressing room. scooter knocks on the door and peers in. julie fixes her hair. julie andrews. uh, fifteen seconds to curtain, miss andrews. thank you. thank you, i'll be ready. i'll be ready just so long as nobody else drops in. a gaggle of hollering muppet monsters fall from the ceiling and surround her. it's the muppet show, with our very special guest star, miss julie andrews. yaaay. the curtain opens, and the theme begins. statler and waldorf whistle along to the music. gonzo's horn lights up as the stage lights dim. thank you, thank you, thank you, and welcome again to the muppet show. hey, we're very excited around here tonight. our guest star is a wonderfully talented lady and a good friend of mine. and here she is now, ladies and gentlemen, miss julie andrews. julie sings "the lonely goatherd" and is joined by a goat, kermit , and several other muppet characters.  you know, i saw the movie twice. the song finishes. applause. hooray. bravo. i loved the goat.  he would... the old goat.  kermit, still in costume, goes backstage with the rest of them, also passing a live cow. ok, great opening number with the goats and the pigs. way to go, cow.  cow. he goes closer to investigate. it's a real cow, all right. scooter. yeah, chief. scooter, uh, refresh my memory. uh, was there a cow in that opening number. no. then what's a cow doing backstage.. what cow. that cow right there.  kermit, that's a cow. i know what it is.. how'd it get in here. i guess he must've sneaked in. cows don't sneak. snakes sneak. uh, find out who it belongs to. ok. who do you belong to. scooter. ok, chief. ok.  i think they're gonna love this show in jersey. the newsman runs up to the desk. here is a muppet news flash. a plane carrying a load of sports equipment was forced to jettison some of its cargo. among the items tossed out were ten thousand pingpong balls   and one bowling ball. bop. a bowling ball knocks him out. main stage. kermit enters. ladies and gentlemen, in a major feat of deathdefying musicrobatics never seen before... >ahem< uh, the great gonzo will perform on bagpipes the eine kleine nachtmusik from a flagpole, ten feet in the air. uh, ladies and gentlemen, the great gonzo. an offkey fanfare plays. gonzo does his thing, until a hungry beaver chews the pole and causes him to fall. timber.  hey, gonzo should quit while he's ahead. huh, gonzo should quit while he's alive. they chuckle. gonzo and the beaver go backstage. are you ok, gonzo. oh, sure. i just fell eleven feet onto solid concrete. huh, well, that's too bad. it looks like you're gonna have to get a new bagpipe. yeah, i'm having it made out of solid beaver skin. uh, sorry about that beaver. i don't know how it got in here. usually we're much more careful about who we allow in this place.  yeah, i can see that.  yeah, the cow. it's been a bad night for security. wow. you got a great pair of legs. in fact, she's got two great pair of legs. hey, uh, you wouldn't think about going into show business, would you. will you at least have dinner with me. promise. gonzo. oh.  hey, chief. hmm. well, so far nobody knows nothing about the cow. well, keep trying. we cannot have a cow backstage. hmm. well, look on the bright side. hmm. at least you won't have to give us milk money anymore. scooter. they both run off. rowlf plays "moonlight sonata" as the moon rises in the background. kermit and julie sit at a brick wall with a park backdrop. you know, julie, it's very nice to be able to talk quietly with you for a minute. thank you, kermit, i feel the same way. you know, there's something i was going to ask you. excuse me, julie. hey, kermit. yeah. your nephew robin just fell in a tuba. he just what. he fell in a tuba. but, it's ok. animal's getting him out. a loud blatt is heard. robin sails across the stage. whee. gesundheit.  hey, robin, are you all right. yeah, it's fun.  oh, my. now, you were saying, julie. oh, well, i was gonna ask  uh, excuse me  i hate to interrupt, julie. uh, excuse me. kermit. yeah. kermit, uh, did you ask to see the flying zucchinis' human cannonball act. not right now, fozzie. ok, i'll go tell them.  byebye. bye. a loud bang is heard. a zucchini brother flies across the stage from left to right.  uh, kermit, i was too late, y'see  oh, never mind. yes, you were saying... bang. another cannon is heard. another zucchini brother flies across the stage from right to left.  uh, you see, they have two cannons... ok, ok. just get out of here. oh. yes, yes, sir, yes. now, i'm sorry, julie, you were trying to say... kermit. sweetums and thog are playing badminton. so. well, they're playing with my chicken. camilla is swatted back and forth. another zucchini brother flies across the stage. robin takes another tuba ride. rinse and repeat. uh, julie, you were asking. oh, nothing. i just... was wondering what you guys did for entertainment around here. oh, nothing much. scooter, fozzie and gonzo all watch the badminton match along with them. fowl. the typical "at the dance" music plays, until gonzo takes the center and starts to sing. and now the band is playing very slow. >sniff< and once again, i'll get my coat and go. a lonely wallflower waiting by the wall, without the willpower to face the music at all. please, won't somebody dance with me. start up a romance with me. just someone to care, someone somewhere, who will dance with me. he approaches a couple. uh, excuse me. you're excused. he approaches a pig couple. excuse me, it's, it's time to change partners. no, it's time to change ballrooms, creep. he approaches another couple. excuse me, can i cut in. that reminds me, marvin, did you remember to feed the anteater. please, won't somebody dance with me. start up a romance with me.  there she is. he and camilla twirl around and around as the others watch. lubbock lou and his jughuggers sing "borneo." kermit, you've really been busy since i saw you last. oh, yeah. we've been doing this show and all that stuff. oh, and i love the shows. i watch them every week. oh, hey, that's nice. gee, but, uh, you know, one thing a lot of people don't know about you, is that you write children's books. i really enjoy doing that, too. mmhm. and you also write songs. well, i wrote one for you, remember. you wrote one for me. oh, kermit, how could you have forgotten. oh, i didn't forget. we did it on a special of yours a couple of years ago. that's right. hey, would you do that now. oh, i thought you'd never ask. music swells up and the lights dim to a nautical blue.  actually, i knew she was gonna do it. they giggle. ready. mmhmm. when you were a tadpole, and i was a fish, when the whole world had barely begun as far back as that. mmhmm. i saw you swim by, with a smile in your eye, and i loved you from that moment on. that's a lovely thought. and through all the changes from fins into fingers, i longed for the day you would be the sweet loving person you've finally become from that faraway day in the sea. and my first wish  what's that. that you'd love me too, 'cause i've loved you since you were a tadpole, and i was a fish. oh, that really is a lovely song. oh, i'm glad you like it, kermit. it's a little bit fishy. oh.  i... i really love it, though. and i love when you sing it. thank you. i'm so glad that you love me too, 'cause i've loved you since you were a tadpole  and i was guess what. a fish. a fish. kermit snuggles up to her. applause. sam walks up to the podium as his fanfare plays. i have here a list. a list of the animals these socalled "conservationists" would have us protect. just listen to this. the mountain lion. hah. the alligator. huh. the coyote, the timber wolf. ha. the american bald eagle.  the american bald eagle.  excuse me, this list is now inoperative. he exits. gonzo, holding flowers and candy, looks for the cow. where's the cow. we had a date. oh, she's gone. oh. well, i guess i've still got time to call a chicken.  say, where's the cow. oh, well, i finally found someone who's gonna do something with her. oh, yeah. who. the swedish chef. eep. they both rush over. meanwhile, the chef is painting crosssections on the cow. what are you doing.   de brbece. you can't do that. come on, out, out. he shoos the chef away. now, scooter. hmm. uh, would you erase that cow.  oh, sure, boss.  erase the cow. welcome again to muppet labs, where the future is being made today. well, we are just feverishly excited here at the labs today because our latest invention is ready for testing. here it is, muppet labs' new hairgrowing tonic. and who better to test it on than my willing and eager lab assistant, beaker. come on in here, beaker. beaker appears skittish. now you would like to  you would just love to test this new hairgrowing tonic, wouldn't you, beaker.  mmmm. mmhmm, i knew he would. ok, just sit down on this stool, here. come on. there you go. he shakes some tonic on beaker's hair. we'll shake a little bit of this on here. put it down. and massage it in vigorously. well, yes, now in a matter of seconds you can grow a rich, luxurious head of hair. go from a baldy to a shaggy in the mere tick of a clock. there. now watch closely, here's the result of using muppets' hairgrowing tonic. beaker's scalp rockets off his head. perhaps we should call it "hairraising" tonic.  kermit looks at the cow. hey, kermit. kermit, i found some guys who'll get rid of the cow for you. oh, that's great. who are they. the zucchini brothers. the human cannonball act. yeah, but now they're gonna change it to a cow cannonball act. the zucchini brothers wheel in a cannon. boomabooma. ok, now we get it. there'sa the cow.  wait, wait, wait. no, no, no. i'm a frog. the cow's over there. oh. that'sa the cow. of coursea. we gotta put'a the cow into the cannon. yeah, boomabooma. boomabooma. i don't believe this. i'm gonna go introduce julie andrews. okay, you do the boomabooma. main stage. kermit enters to a fanfare. and now, ladies and gentlemen, once again, miss julie andrews. open on a dark and spooky park. monsters dance and hide as julie enters through the gate, whistling. as she sings "i whistle a happy tune," she tries to fend off the monsters. ok, kids, this has been a lot of fun. i think we should now pretend i get away. she runs away, but the monsters catch up with her and toss her about. oh, help. don't be afraid, julie. we only wanted your autograph for a picture. the other monsters nod in agreement. well, i don't happen to have a pen on me at the moment. but, er, there's one at the police station around the corner. come with me. they all stand up and give the song a proper finish. applause. well, we've come now to the end of another muppet show and i must say that this one has been a particularly mooving experience. but before we go, let's have a warm thank you to our special guest star, ladies and gentlemen, miss julie andrews. thank you. thank you, kermit. i've really had a super time on the show. oh, good. except for one thing. uh, what's that. well, i seem to have lost my cow around here somewhere. cow. that was your cow. boom. a cannon is heard. kermit, what was that.  uh, nothing  yay. boomabooma. we'll see you next time on the muppet show. the credits roll as julie asks around. kermit, about my cow. it was quite small. have you seen a cow here, has lovely brown eyes and big lashes. you've seen her.  that's funny, she was here when i came in. wanna go to a movie or... grab a steak. ) )
