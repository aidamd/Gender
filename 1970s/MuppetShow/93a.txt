dance marathon. yowza, yowza, yowza.  hit it, boys. the curtain opens to reveal couples dancing in a ballroom as a band plays an instrumental of "i'm just wild about harry". round and round the couples go, till they drop and that's the show. the band plays, and the couples dance. hey, hey, you know what sea monsters eat. i give up. fish and ships.  why do we keep dancing around in a circles.

his champagne glass. uh, s' about um uh  could somebody clean up the floor out here. the cleaning lady comes out as gonzo blows the whistle again and the music switches to a tango. a bird couple slips on the floor while she mops it. wonder who the old bat with the mop is. animal gets buried in her gown as they tango. she fishes him out. you really are an animal. ahahahaha.  yowza, yowza, yowza. aren't these contestants putting on a great show. come on, come on, put on a great show. he blows the whistle, and the band starts playing "12th street rag". that's it, that's it.  we're six grueling minutes into this marathon  and still these contestants can really tear things up. but. how long can it last.  the bonedeadening fatigue will soon start to take its toll.  soon every step will bring terrible agony. the muscles rebel. the mind goes numb. the hideous torture of neverending pain and torment will re  a whatnot couple collapses on him. he gets up. ladies and gentlemen, our first dropouts. haha. give these kids a hand. uh, scooter, get those dancers offstage. beauregard, get that scenery onstage. come on now, move it.  what's that scenery. uh  i promised carol a variety show, and she's gonna get one. that's pigs in space. but what about the dance marathon.  oh, don't worry. ja, we worked out a compromise. hee hee hee. open with a closeup of a disco ball, zooming out to reveal that it's in the galaxy outside the vehicle. in our last episode, the crew of the swinetrek had captured a weird alien creature. as piggy examines the creature, link and strangepork dance to an instrumental of "tie a yellow ribbon". link. uh  strangepork. will you two quit fooling around and help me communicate with this weird alien creature. well, why don't you dance with him. dance is the universal language. oh, thanks a lot, strangepork  aah. the creature starts dancing with her as she shrieks. i think she's beginning to communicate with the alien. help. what's he saying. mmm. hungry.  well, look on the bright side. she'll probably be happier in there.  mm, i know we'll be happier out here.   miss piggy, you'll be disqualified for not dancing. aw, come off it, gonzo. there are no exceptions to the rules. oh, all right, all right.  one, two, one, two, one and two, one and two, fred and ginger were never better. we return to the dance floor. yowza, yowza. welcome back to the dance marathon. our contestants are rested and relaxed and ready to give you a great show. ready to give you a punch in the eye.  he's a great sport, huh, folks. so, here we go.  it's polka time. oh,

plays a slow song. ohh. i hope this is over pretty soon. not me. what. after it's over, i promised my wife i'd take her to the disco. uh, you know they say that dancing can add years to your life. absolutely true. well, how do you know. i'm 23 years old. gonzo approaches the cleaning lady as she sways. i told you, nobody on the floor except dance contestants. she reveals a #37 on her backside. oh yeah. where's your partner. she displays a #58 on her mop. i don't think i can dance another step. oh. well, during the next rest period, why not come up to my dressing room then, and i'll loosen your collar and uh, heh, put you on the couch... uhh, did we come here to dance or to talk. an ambulance siren is heard. keep dancing. it is not a rest period. that was just another ambulance arriving.  everybody limbo. the band plays a latin rhythm as the dancers wiggle under a limbo stick. meanwhile, a frustrated carol packs her bag, sniffling. uh  excuse me, carol, the door was open, and i just thought  yeah. yeah, you bet it's open. you bet it's open, kermit. because as soon as i'm packed, i'm going to be out that door like a shot.  i have never, ever been so humiliated and
