are once again with another great show for you, with our special guest star, mr. jim nabors. and all of this  all of this is coming to you, by the way, from the benny vandergast memorial theater. uh, we on the muppet show owe everything to benny. including three months back rent. so in lieu of the rent, here's the fantastic dr. teeth with "money." yeahhhh. dr. teeth plays "money" for the opening number. as the song reaches its climax, dr. teeth pulls a lever on the side of his piano, and it acts as a lotto machine, pouring out bills and coins. they don't write the old songs anymore. nope. they only write new ones. yeah. wha. hilda follows dr. teeth past kermit, carrying the prop money. oh, dr. teeth, you are one hip dude. nice number, nice number. don't lose any of that money though.

anything you need. i see. scooter follows kermit as he walks. yeah, well, i work real cheap and i got plenty of ideas for your theater, and i'll start tonight. ok. listen, kid, i'm sorry, but you're too young, you don't have any experience, and i don't have any money for it in the budget. yeah, well, my uncle owns this theater. kermit stops in his tracks. uh, you start today, get me a cup of coffee, your salary is 20 a week.  stand by for the next number. could you make it 25. are you kidding. i can't afford it. gee, my uncle will be really disappointed. how about 30.  open on a row of houses. zoom in on the two left. my wife's not feeling well. oh, sorry to hear it. what's the trouble. she's got the shingles. zoom out. musical button. uh, we're real proud to have with us on the show tonight, a gentleman who has two distinct personalities. he's a real country boy who became famous as gomer pyle, and also he sings everything from pop to opera. so let's give a real muppet show welcome to jim nabors. open on muppet ranch. music swells up, and jim sings. gone with the wind, just like a leaf that has blown away. gone with the wind, my romance has flown away. yesterday's kisses are still on my lips. i had a lifetime of heaven at my fingertips. a belle makes her way to him. he embraces her. now all is gone, gone is the rapture that thrilled my heart. gone with the wind, the gladness that filled my heart. the wind becomes stronger, blowing her out of his arms. just like a flame, love burned brightly then became an empty smoke dream that has gone, gone with the wind. jim looks around as the wind becomes stronger. now all is gone, gone is the rapture that thrilled my heart. gone with the wind, the gladness that filled my heart. the fence and the muppet ranch sign collapse. the girl comes back. her wig falls off, then she is blown away again. just like a flame, love burned brightly then became an empty smoke dream that has gone, gone with the wind. jim's pants fall down as he finishes the song. i tell ya, that jim nabors is a real good sport, a real good singer. i used to live next door to him. he was a real good nabor.  here's a muppet newsflash.  billy lee boomer, a gasstation attendant from penny box, texas, reported a flying saucer landed at his station last night. said mr. boomer  jim appears in the monitor. they didn't want no gas, they just wanted to use the restroom. can't say as i blame 'em. said they'd traveled 83 million miles without a stop.  wayne and wanda walk past kermit. no, i don't know when we're going on either.  always griping. scooter rushes over. hey kermit, here's your coffee  whoa. he spills it on kermit, who screams. hot, huh. just the way you like it. mm too much sugar. yeah, well anyway, i just found this fantastic new act. uh, scooter, i don't have time on the show for a new act. oh, that's too bad. i found him in my uncle's office. it's his favorite act.  uh, what's the name of the act. oh. they're called the danceros. oh, they're fantastic. they're outta sight. and they're your uncle's favorite act. right.  i'll introduce them. oh boy. hey danceros, you're on. main stage. kermit enters to laughter. okay, uh, now with great pride and uh, ahem, no little fear, the international debut of the danceros. whatever they are. the curtain opens on two pairs of tapdancing legs. take it.    take it.    take it. zoom out to reveal that the four legs  belong to one creature. going home. the music speeds up, and he stumbles over his own legs and collapses as it ends. it went better in rehearsal. he stumbles offstage. animal walks past jim. hey, animal. are you on next. yeah. well, as they say in show business, break a leg. wha. i said break a leg. oh, thank you. animal whacks jim on the leg with a mallet. jim yelps, and animal giggles. scooter follows kermit around, much to kermit's dismay. george, george. come here. i'm busy. come here. have you met scooter. this is scooter. he's our new gofer, so if you need anything around here, you know   need anything. me. need anything from some young kid. huh.  listen, kid. i've been with this theater since the very beginning, you know. before that new guy bought it and ruined it. heh. now the roof leaks, and the seats are torn, the furnace is on the fritz. i tell you, he is the worst. yeah, he's my uncle. he is the best. what's a theater without problems.  right. your uncle's got a good head on his shoulders. oh. unlike some people around here. a headless figure walks by. couples dance in a ballroom. ten, eleven, twelve. yeah, go. you know, my marriage was wrecked by something really stupid. what was that. my husband. you know, my doctor says i'm getting the asian flu. what did he say to do. he says take two fortune cookies and he'd call me in the morning. do you believe in the hereafter. oh, yes. ah, then you know what i'm here after. oh, i just love this music. are you listening to me.  your voice is music to my ears. you got something i've been looking for all my life. well, it's halftime. it is. yeah. what's the score. eh, muppets six, audience nothing. baskerville stands by the piano as rowlf plays. all right,

within. oh, play it pretty, rowlf. yeller dog, nearby prowls.  smells a sausage, softly growls. clumsy man, wooden leg, upsets the boiler with his peg.  spills a sausage, scatters wurst, yeller dog, he gets there first. he grabs the sausage, splits the fog. it's another case of dogeatdog.  it's another case of dogeatdog.  hey, you know, jim, it's a real pleasure to have you with us on the show. well, thank you, kermit. it's a real pleasure to be here. i'm sort of an old country boy and i feei right at home with all these chickens and roosters and pigs. especially that miss piggy, i just love

mind me. kermit, one thing. i never know whether to call him jim or gomer.  well, i guess it is kinda confusing. you see, i played gomer pyle on television for so long  gomer pyle. i love gomer pyle. oh, thank you. well, i played him for so long i guess i get confused myself. but it goes along with my astrological sign. you see, i'm a gemini. that means i got twin personalities. oh, yeah. hey, listen, well, i'm a taurus. you're a taurus. that's the sign of the bull, isn't it. mmhm. i'm a bullfrog.  that's just a little joke. what sign were you born under, piggy. well, i, uh, wasn't born under a sign. i was born over a sign. at becker's butcher shop. i moved as soon as possible. i don't blame you. hey, i was wondering, jim, does being a gemini give you any kind of problems. well, it sure does, you know, because, you know, i talk like this, but then i sing like this: he sings a passage from pagliacci, knocking kermit off the wall. kermit walks off.  what happened to kermit. he doesn't appreciate classical music, james. but it drives me bananas.  oh, sing again, please. oh, jim. oh, i love it when you sing. hold me. wait a minute, miss piggy. control yourself, miss piggy.
