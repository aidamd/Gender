forget that the closing number is a rootin'tootin' guntotin' cowboy desperado shootemup. yeah, kermit, listen  uh, animal and i have been talking this over, and uh, there's an awful lot of violence in entertainment these days. we'd like to do something a little bit more enlightened. uh, something more serene. like maybe a salute to japan. oh. uh, yeah, well, we  well, we already have the cowboys and we rented the horses, though. james grabs kermit by the neck. kermit  we want to do something serene. he aims kermit at animal's mouth. sarene. yyes, uh, well, that, that's a good idea, yes

ha ha ha. animal. huh. serenely. serenely. he strikes the gong again, then holds his ear up to it. he strikes it again loudly. ha ha ha ha. oh  oh  james continues to play the gong quietly. animal listens. boring. the cowboy watches from a window. you guys are really dyin' out there. shhh. i'm telling you, jimmy, you should've done the western. we're doing the eastern. what kind of a dance you call that. square. most humbly beg to differ. this not square dance. this square dance. square dance music with a japanese flair begins to play, as the geishas form a line and begin to dance. the cowboys join them. hey, buckaroos, it's a hoedown.  a fiddler appears in the window. james shrugs. well, i certainly can't beat 'em. lean your partners to and fro, all join in with an oh soh do. they
