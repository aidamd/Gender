muppet news bulletin.  dateline, new brunswick. mr. melvin cosgrove climbed a 30foot pole and scrambled onto a sixbysixfoot platform. his goal: to break the world's record in flagpole sitting. that was 16 years ago, and yesterday his wife started wondering how cosgrove was doing, especially since he was 84 years old when he started. authorities climbed the pole this morning and found that he had indeed passed away. as a fitting tribute to her brave husband, mrs. cosgrove announced that for the next ten days, she will fly him at halfmast. he scowls and walks away. couples dance in a ballroom, starting with mildred and george. you know, i, uh, picked up a hitchhiker the other day. oh, really. yes, well, it's only right. i was the one who knocked him down. we go on to zoot and janice. tell

in shape, you know. oh, you're telling me. i've seen you dancing on broadway and television and movies. why, you must work out a lot, huh.  well, yes, because you see, kermit, as a dancer, your body is one of the most important things you have. did you ever stop to think where, would you be without your, um  your body. uh  no, no, i never asked myself that, but it's a darn good question.  you see, as a dancer, i've gotta be able to go to a leap, uh, with great explosive power, you see did somebody say "explosive power". no. no. nice. nice leap. well, time for a tea break. all right. he
