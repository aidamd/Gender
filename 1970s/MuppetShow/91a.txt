fanfare. if you have tears, prepare to shed them, as our very special guest brings us a literary recitation. ladies and gentlemen, tony randall. open on a marble setting. tony walks up to a podium. piggy stands behind him with a green jewel placed on her forehead. the green eye of the little yellow god. maestro, if you will, please. a pianist accompanies him. there's a oneeyed yellow idol to the north of kathmandu. there's a little marble cross below the town. there's a brokenhearted woman tends the grave of "mad" carew, while the yellow god for ever gazes down. he was known as "mad" carew  uh, mr. randall, mr. randall  what. well, it's about the spell. it  can't you see that i'm communing with my muse. oh, sorry, uh, i didn't know you were on the phone. uh, i found a spell that'll turn a statue into a pig, though. but i like her as a statue, for now. oh. well, just in case, uh, the word is "pigskin". pigskin. the spell works. piggy walks up to tony. who're you calling "pigskin"  fishface.   hello. mmhm. glad to see you back. i, um  i was just, um, ordering a football. scooter, get me that pigskin, will you. oh, check. sure. it's uh, something i need in my recitation here, with the uhhuh, uhhuh. there's a football in the green eye of the little yellow god. it's  it's poetic license. a football is tossed to him right then and there. see.  so, we're all set now, huh. you understand. good. i'm watching you closely, randall. good. why don't you run out for a long one, huh. here we go.  now we will resume, if we may  professor. the pianist resumes. he was known as "mad carew"  piggy is chased by football players.  get away from me. the chase continues as he recites.  by the chaps at kathmandu, he was wilder than they felt inclined to tell. but, for all his foolish pranks, he was worshipped in the ranks. and the colonel's daughter smiled on him  you're chasing each other wrong.  whaddya say. we're trying to do a show here. how about a little cooperation. check. all right, hit it, boys. cue the orchestra. the players, including rizzo, start singing the fight song "on, wisconsin." tony continues, unheard, with his recitation. the players run away. an ugly knife lay buried in the heart of "mad" carew  'twas the vengeance of the little yellow pig. i thank you. he collapses slowly. applause. okay. well, we've just about come down to the end of another one, but before we go, let us say thank you to a wonderful guest star, ladies and gentlemen, tony randall. yaaay. thank you. thank you very very much, kermit. real thrill being here with you. you're a hero of mine. wow. yeah. i just wanted to apologize for accidentally turning miss piggy into a stone like that. i didn't mean to. oh, listen  don't mention it. we all make mistakes. incidentally, how did it happen. i don't know. all i said was "zark zark chumbo, klong klong chumbo" and the next thing i  kermit turns to stone. kermit.  what happened. i don't know. all i said was   that's all for tonight. we'll see you next time on the muppet show. kermit. i'm so sorry. tune in next time, find out, will an ugly girl kiss kermit and turn him back. he waves. the credits roll as the banter continues. i once knew a whole chorus line that was turned to stone. what chorus line was that. the rockettes. they chuckle. ) )
