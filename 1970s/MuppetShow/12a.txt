is a little strange. strange. yeah, well, it isn't like any other show on television. i mean uh, i'll buy the fact that you're a frog who can talk. well, there's nothing strange about that. and i'll even buy the chicken, uh, who shares my dressing room. but she's not for sale. i beg your pardon. the chicken's not for sale. oh. i mean, i wouldn't mind selling her, but uh, her husband plays in the

fanfare. bruce takes the stage. thank you so much. thank you. and may i say, you look a wonderful audience. don't be too sure. we haven't heard your jokes yet. they chuckle. sir, you're old enough to

look as though you could use some. why don't you go to the blood bank and cash an artery. good. good stuff. well, i've heard better. i'm sure you have, sir. in fact, at your age you're lucky you can hear at all.  only kidding. only kidding. you've probably got a great sense of humor. in fact, i know you have. i saw your wife outside.  oh. oh, he's burying me. he's burying me. all right. but you know, one thing i like about our two countries at the moment is we do have this cultural exchange going on. i mean, we send you lots of our drama shows like upstairs, downstairs, the six wives of henry viii, um, the forsyth saga and by the way, i thought eric porter played my life brilliantly. ha. i was going to play the part myself, but they said i wasn't the type. and uh, then of course you send us your drama shows like columbo, starsky and hutch, police woman. they're not shakespeare perhaps, but just as violent. haha. by the way, thank you for kojak. he's made such a big hit in our country. he's such a sportsman. goes to scotland, plays golf, and he's also a good tenpin bowler  got the head for it. but he gets very annoyed at the bowling alley 'cause people keep sticking their fingers up his nose.  got to be a split. anyway, don't let's talk about him. let's get back to me. ladies and gentlemen  excuse me, uh, mr. forsyth. oh, please, please call me bruce. oh. ladies and gentlemen, the one and only fozzie bear. hey hey. yeah, thank heavens there's only one. they chuckle. aw. see  see those guys up there. the minute i come out, they start up. don't worry. don't worry.

well, why don't you flap them and fly outta here.  ho, ho. look, you can handle those two. well  you can do it. all you need, all you need is a bit of pacing, a bit of timing. yeah. the right retort. the right line. oh. oh, he couldn't throw a line to a drowning man. they chuckle. uh  uh  go on. ok, uh  do you mind. we work alone. that is, uh, unless we work together. how's that. a little soft, fozzie. awww.  go for the jugular vein, there. go right in. right there. ok. go on, yeah. uh, uh  oh. oh. uh, hey, is that a suit you're wearing. it's a nice one, yeah, but won't your wife notice the hole in the livingroom rug.  that's good. now you're rolling. go in for the kill. go in for the kill. hey, that's some nose you got there, buster. why don't you rent yourself out as an anteater.  i like it. oh, yeah. oh, yeah. oh, yeah. oh, yeah. quit while you're ahead. quit while you're ahead. you call that a head. i've seen better heads on cabbages.   you don't want to lose your audience. you  you call that an audience. it looks more like an oil painting.  aah. you've got 'em. believe me, you've got 'em. got 'em. who wants 'em. who wants 'em. statler and waldorf wave a white flag. no, no. enough, enough. we surrender. we surrender. no more, no more. you did it, fozzie.  ah. i did. bruce, i did it. oh, i did it. i did. oh. oh. oh. bruce, this is the happiest moment of my life. oh, just,

by  side. fozzie wiggles his ears as bruce waves his hands. i like the ears. keep the ears going. they love it. listen to that. the curtain closes. fozzie reemerges, while bruce tries to restrain him. thank you. thank you. thank you. thank you. and now, veterinarian's hospital, the continuing story of an orthopedic surgeon who's gone to the dogs. piggy drinks from a wine glass, notices she's on
