to get things started, here's our own fozzie bear, who will perform for you tonight on roller skates. kermit. i think the act needs just a bit more...  .. rehearsaaaaal. crash. well, uh, so much for the opening number. uh, ow we suddenly arrive at guest star time... fozzie returns, trying to keep his balance. ladies and gentlemen, mr. lou rawls. lou rawls sings "groovy people" with the sleeze brothers. that lou rawls is one fantastic singer. yeah, so am i. you wanna hear me sing. only if you sing solo. solo. so low i can't hear.  the sleeze brothers pass by kermit. okay, nice and groovy, guys. very groovy. hey, chief. hmm. i thought fozzie was going to do the opening spot on the show. well, that was the plan, but he wasn't quite ready, so we switched numbers. oh. so what happens now, a news flash or fozzie's roller skating act.  waaahhohohooo  i'll tell the newsman he's on.  here is a muppet news flash.  dateline, new york. medical science has been baffled by a sudden epidemic of the rare disease mallarditis. the illness strikes very quickly and causes its victim to turn into a duck.  mallarditis. that's the silliest thing i ever... pop. his head turns into a duck's head. he walks off, quacking. and now, veterinarian's hospital, the continuing stoooory of a quack who has gone to the dogs. on to the next patient. what's this. he was here a minute ago. oh, wow. this is happening a lot lately. what is. dr. bob is losing his patients.  that's untrue. i never lose my patience. what about the patient you accidentally fed nitroglycerin to. they all laugh. him, i lost.  but i found him again. where. in iowa, minnesota, north and south dakota. they all laugh. that was him all over. they all laugh and look up as they hear the announcer. so, once again dr. bob has come to nothing. tune in next time when you will hear him say... hey. who are you. who. you. you know, the voice we keep hearing in here. i'm the announcer. i'm the guy who says,  "and now, veterinarian's hospital, the continuing stoooory of a quack who has gone to the dogs." they rush through the sketch once more. well, on to the next patient. what's this. he was here a minute ago. oh, wow. this is happening a lot lately. what is. dr. bob is losing his patients.  untrue. i never lose my patience. what about the patient you accidentally fed nitroglycerin to. they all laugh. him, i lost.  but i found him again. where. in maryland, virginia, north and south carolina. they all laugh. that's him all over.  they all laugh and look up as they hear the announcer. and so, dr. bob has done all the same jokes twice. tune in next time when you will hear nurse janice say... shall we go for thirds. they all laugh. no, that would try my patience. you don't have any patients. ohh. i would if it weren't for that dumb nitroglycerin. they all laugh. lou encounters floyd and animal outside. hey floyd, animal. what's happening. hey, lou rawls. whoa, animal.  hey, good to see you. no haps  you

doesn't even sound the same when i say it. hey, but listen, uh, would you do a little bit of that for us right now. no. no, i won't. no. no. you see, kermit, you really can't sing jazz without soft light, you know, a little atmosphere. and you gotta have a band. oh, well listen, you got it. the electric mayhem appears behind them, playing uptempo. hey, kermit. this is an inspiration and an open invitation, you know, for some soulful syncopation, you dig. hey does that mean something good. yes. it means, "let's sing". wonderful, i'll be over here.  pack up all my care and woe, here i go,

the swedish chef enters, skating flawlessly. easy for you to say.  whoa, whoa. welcome again to muppet labs, where the future is being made today. well, our latest development is the nuclearpowered shaver.  the honor of shaving for the very first time with the nuclearpowered shaver goes to my faithful lab assistant, beaker. come on in here, beaker. beaker enters, shakily. it's all right, come on. there you go. now, in order to protect beaker's fluffy orange hair from nuclear fallout    he will wear this protective helmet, which is...   made of solid lead. bend over, beaker, here. come on. hurry up, bend over.  there. all right. up you go, beaker. now beaker is ready for the demonstration. the helmet is so heavy that beaker's head sinks into his body. notice how effective the lead helmet is. now beaker doesn't need a shave.  uh, as you may have noticed, fozzie has taken up roller skating. so here he is with funny jokes and figure eights, mr. fozzie bear. the curtain opens as fozzie's fanfare plays. hiya, hiya, hiya. hahaha. how about that. haven't told one joke and i'm rolling already. aaah.  whoa, whoa.  not bad on a tencent pair of skates, huh. speaking of cheapskates... ahaha. "nice blend, fozzie." "thank you, fozzie." hahaha. hey, hey, hey... the next joke i'm gonna tell, i'm gonna do it while, while skating a figure eight. here it goes... organ music plays as he rolls haphazardly. speaking of cheapskates, i know a guy so cheap, when he goes fishing, he puts a picture of a worm on his hook and he catches a picture of a fish. wuh  hahaha. hey, this is a great way for fozzie to do his material. yeah, a moving target is harder to hit. they chuckle. oh, yeah. well, watch this. uh  i'm gonna tell this next joke while skating  skating backwards, aand with my foot in the air, wiggling my ears. here it goes... y'hah. hoh. aah. okay  a guy walks in to a diner. there's a horse behind the counter. the guy just looks at the horse. the horse says, "what's the matter, surprised to see me here." and the guy says, "yeah, did the cow sell the place." aaahh. he bumps into statler and waldorf's box.  he was doing okay until he fell off the stage. wrong. he was doing okay until he came on the stage. they chuckle. fozzie gets himself up. "did the cow sell the place." ahaha. and now, once again, ladies and gentlemen, this time backed by the big band of dr. teeth, here he is, mr. lou rawls. lou, backed by the electric mayhem, sings "you're the one" to miss piggy, making this the second song of the evening to be dedicated to her. i hear ya, lou.  tell me, tell me. you are the one, miss piggy  you are the one. oh, my little sweet porkchop, my little hammock, you're the one. applause. okay, well, that's about all the time we have, but before we go...  i'm going now... uh, as i was saying, before we go, let's have a warm thank you to our special guest star, ladies and gentlemen, mr. lou rawls.  thank you, kermit. wait a minute...  let's not stop.  now that we've got things going. the other muppets roll around the stage. well,  we'll see you next time on the muppet show. the credits roll as well. i loved tonight's show. really. of course not. just wanted to see if i could say it. they chuckle. ) )
