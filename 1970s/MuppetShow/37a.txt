chuckle. hey, hey, come on, guys. no heckling. i mean, i'm not even out here to tell jokes. have you ever been. they chuckle. heyyyyy, you know that the bear is funny. you're right. in fact, i never enjoyed you more than i did last week.  oh, th... well, i didn't do an act last week. i rest my case. they chuckle. that's very good.   uh, ladies and gentlemen, here is gonzo the great with a trumpet solo, "flight of the bumblebee". that does it, i'm leaving.  gonzo plays "the flight of the bumblebee" on a trumpet accompanied by rowlf on the piano. a small bumblebee starts flying around and animal chases the bumblebee with a club, injuring both gonzo and rowlf in the process. couples dance in a ballroom. you know, the trouble with women is they always take things personally. i don't. switch to zelda rose and droop. the trouble with men is that they're all too wishywashy. well, sometimes yes, and... sometimes no. switch to two more. the trouble with you is you can't take criticism. oh, that's a lowdown, rotten lie. what do you mean i can't take... switch to two more. the trouble with you is you're conceited. i am not. although i have every reason to be. switch to two more. the trouble with you is you're always sticking your nose into everybody's business. aw, what choice have i got. switch to two more. you know, the trouble with you is you're so stubborn. you refuse to change. poof. her head turns into a green frackle's head. wanna bet. rowlf plays "english country garden" on the piano. fozzie stops by and observes, then plays it in a higher octave. hey. i didn't know you could play the piano. i didn't know it either. i'll join in. rowlf joins in. very good. here i go.  oh, he's good. they play together. yeah. ahh... this is my part.   take it. very good. thank you. mine.   yeah. together. they play together. okay. you take it now, okay. ready, go.  ahh... come on in. they play together. this is fun. ahhhh. ready. what. modulate. what's that. they modulate together. yeah, you did it. thank you. whatever. fozzie's hat falls off. they continue playing. oh, my hat. what do i do.  can you play hatless. what. i said "can you play hatless." i don't know. who wrote it. keep playing. yes, sir. they play louder and faster. oh, that's how it works, huh. just play. yes, sir.  big finish. they do the big finish. watch out. huh. fozzie goes from the high to the low notes, knocking rowlf over. applause. well, jaye p., how ya doing. just terrible.  no, i mean, so far on the show, i've been attacked by animal and two explosions have gone off next to me. i'm starting to feel like a moving target around here. well  well, let me explain about those explosions. you see, on this show explosions are one of our trademarks. i can believe that. uh, in in fact, on this show, things blow up all the time. i mean, anything can blow up. uh, you see what i mean. wow.  how'd you do that. well, it was really quite simple. in fact, it's rather fun.  i guess you could say you got a bang out of it, huh.  uh, well, you could say that, but, uh, we did that joke last year. check. uh, what else could we talk about. uh, how about your hat. oh, great idea. you know, explosions are one of your trademarks. mmhmm. well, spectacular hats are one of mine. ah, that one is fantastic. i particularly wanted to wear this one on the muppet show, too. well, why is that.  i guess you could say i blew my top.  yeah, well, you could say that but we did that  joke last year. mm. figures. uh, well, jaye p, i think this talk spot is about over. shall we leave. why not. after you. she explodes, then he does. statler and waldorf chuckle. uh, do you suppose that means we'll never see them again. well, we can always hope. they chuckle.  two, three, four. floyd and nigel team up to perform "big noise from winnetka." floyd trades in his trademark sergeant pepper jacket for a white suit and his bass guitar for a bass violin. nigel, in a rare performance, displays a talent for whistling. uh, dr. strangepork, why are we plummeting toward earth at an alarming rate. we've lost the #3 engine. well, how long will it take to fix it. we can't. it's really lost, it fell off.  uh. uh, uh  is there anything we can do. yes, we can maintain our present altitude if we lighten the weight of the rocket ship. how much weight will we have to toss overboard. um... one pig. yeah, that should do it. rather drastic, isn't it. oh, i wasn't thinking of you, link. you're the captain.  well, then perhaps it isn't so drastic. well, i would volunteer myself, except that i'm the only one who knows how all this technical shtuff works. that's very true. well, if it isn't you, or me... enter piggy. she sits down, exhausted. link and strangepork look at each other.  well, i just finished doing the laundry. oh. well, thank you, first mate piggy. but i'm telling you right now, that is the last laundry this pig is doing. you can say that again.  uh, miss piggy. hmm. i have a new assignment for you. oh, yes, my capitan. ahem. uh, dr. strangepork, do you mind. oh, of course. see you later, link. bon voyage, miss piggy.  weird exit line. uh, first mate piggy, i need your help. yes. a real assignment. yes, yes. we are losing altitude  and we must lighten the weight of the rocket by throwing something overboard. oh, and... and you want me to help you decide what. no. oh. we've already decided what. what.  pause. it sinks in with piggy. are you out of your mind..  no hard feelings, i hope, miss piggy. no hard feelings why you ahh. he ejects her before she can karatechop him. when he closes the ejector door, she pops up behind him. au revoir, fatso. she taps him on the shoulder. she karatechops him, then stomps on him.  here is a muppet news flash. a charter flight carrying the london symphony orchestra has been forced to jettison some of the musical instruments. the... a piano falls on him. scooter talks to his uncle. uh, well, uncle j.p., sir, i think you'll find that things around your theater here are just the same as they were last time you came. that bad, huh. well, i'll just have a look around. i believe in giving the frog a fair trial before i throw him out.  but, sir, uh... oh. hey, kermit. hmm. i think you should know my uncle, j.p. grosse, the man who owns this theater, is making another inspection. oh, not j.p. i don't think i can take it. jaye p. overhears him from upstairs. of all the people i can't stand to have around here when we're doing the show, j.p. is the worst. jaye p. stands behind kermit. i mean, j.p. is without a doubt the most difficult, impossible unfriendly... uh, uh, oh...  oh, hi, jaye p.  jaye p..  uh, when i said j.p., just now, i didn't mean jaye p., jaye p., i meant "j.p." j.p. you know what i mean. no. uh, right. wrong. oh, you see, i love having you on the show, but j.p. grosse, the man who owns this theater, is the meanest, stingiest, most heartless person i know.  ahem. i hope you mean that as a compliment, frog. jaye p. and j.p. gang up on him. i think i just put both feet in my mouth. jaye p. and j.p. nod. sam takes the podium as his fanfare plays. ladies and gentlemen, today i talk to you of crime. three burglars pop up behind him. a matter of utmost urgency. we must all be forever on our guard against this rising wave of banditry. the burglars begin stealing various items, such as a tv monitor, a painting, and a safe. yes, yes, banditry and skullduggery... or our entire universe is in danger of being stolen from under us. my friends... my friends, i... i caution you to keep out an eagle eye for the blackguards and rapscallions who are perpetrating this reign of latrociny. the burglars steal his emblem banner and the pillars. latrociny, that means stealing. what, if it weren't for my own eternal vigilance, and... and... and... and absolute awareness of crime, i'm certain that the rising legions of sneak thieves and ne'erdowells, and... and snakes in the grasses  a burglar taps him on the shoulder.  would strip this theater... bare. as he looks behind him, the burglars steal his podium. he turns around and notices it missing. uh, now, remember... make watchfulness... oh.   uh, your watchword. thank you and good night. wait a minute. i now realize television has one major advantage over a live stage show. huh. what's that. a television, you can turn off. they chuckle. the burglars pass kermit, carrying sam. kermit. hey, you guys better return that eagle. in about 30 days... or more. hey, chief. hmm. what's the closing number. oh, it's a song with jaye p. morgan. i think it's gonna be great. at least i hope so, because we've been a little rough on her. it's a perfect song for jaye p., "that old black magic". i only hope jaye p. will do it. uh, if the price is right, i'll do it. always wanted to sing. hoo boy. having two j.p.'s around is really rough. glad you recognize talent, kid. maybe i'll let you keep the theater.  now, let's talk about the singing contract. well  well  well, you see, j.p., i'd really love for you to sing and i'm sure you've got a swell singing voice  ha ha, yeah, well  hey, scooter, go introduce jaye p. morgan while i handle this. yeah, good luck, silver tongue. hoy.  uh, now, um... all right, where do i sign. well, uh  hoo boy. main stage. scooter enters to applause. ladies and gentlemen, here is one of the really super ladies of song, miss jaye p. morgan, with "that old black magic". jaye p. morgan sings "that old black magic" with dr. teeth and the electric mayhem. well, we started this some time ago and it has to end someplace, so this must be the place. but before we go, let us have a warm thank you for our very special guest star, ladies and gentlemen, jaye p. morgan. yaaayy. applause. oh. thank you, thank you. thank you. kermit, it was, oh... you know, i've been blown up, beaten up, insulted. everything's happened to me, but i've had a great time. i mean it. oh, well, it tends to be like that around here. and now, for my first song...  i'd like to dedicate this to the boys down at the j.p. grosse collection agency. now   give me that money, can't get enough, just keep sendin' that greenback stuff. we'll see you next time on the muppet show. money. just keep it comin'  he keeps singing as the credits roll. i wonder if anybody watches this show besides us.  besides me. ) )
