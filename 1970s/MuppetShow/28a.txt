theater. charlie. kermit is supposed to be here. yeah. yes, and besides, don't you know the difference between a frog and a toad. i guess not, no. well, you see, frogs are handsome, debonair and charming, while toads are ugly and give you warts. i see, yes. i guess that means the toad is supposed to be here.  kermit, do forgive charlie. i know that he can be difficult and trying. yeah  i can be difficult without trying. yeah, i know you can. uh, i don't mind, edgar, 'cause i always expect wisecracks from charlie. it's very good to have you here. well, see, yeah, you know, i'm sorry, i don't usually talk to frogs, you know. now, charlie, please. yeah, all right. sometimes i have dinner with frogs though. oh, well, that's nice. yes, they're delicious. now that's not nice. well, make up your mind.  in fact, i once tried to race some frogs, see. i'm not sure i want to hear this. well, you'll get it anyway. i was going to teach them to jump forwards and backwards. and that way they'd have hind legs on both ends, see. and i'd... i'd have the jump on everybody.  you don't know what you're saying. yes i do, bergen. i can read your lips. oh.  that burns him up.  hey, listen, charlie, it's really great to have you here. just uh, try to relax and act natural. well, i am acting natural. really. you look a little wooden to me.  if you're gonna do jokes like that, bergen and i

developed today when the muppet news reporter accidentally went on camera forgetting to put on his pants...  oh. ahem. oh, good grief. open on gonzo and a brick in a boxing ring.  and now, in a feat of grand daring never before seen on this planet, the great gonzo will attempt to wrestle a sixpound red brick while completely blindfolded. gonzo breathes, mentally preparing himself. he sniffs around, detects the brick, grabs it, and immediately goes down. the audience laughs at him.  okay, put the pigs in space set onstage please. kermit, you promised me a welterweight brick.  uh, yeah.  scooter. would you find captain hogthrob and tell him to stand by. check. uh, kermit, where's the glue. uh, well, it's in the office. where's piggy. oh, also, i need some string and some paint, and do

tonight.  there he goes, the dummy and his dummy. dr. strangepork, who can save us from this hideous catastrophe. captain, according to my records, the only person who's had the necessary training to save us is first mate piggy.  oh, i am ready to do whatever is necessary to save the swinetrek and her crew. i am at the service of all porkdom. what is my assignment. miss piggy, you and you alone can operate the independent heating / unifying element across the horizontal equalizing plane and save the entire crew of the swinetrek. oh. i am ready, my captain. excellent.  bring in the equipment for miss piggy. two crew pigs wheel in an ironing board. but what is this. well, surely you recognize the independent heating / unifying element and the the horizontal equalizing plane. you want me to do the laundry.. well, of course. nobody on the crew has had clean laundry for a week. that is correct. we are all living like pigs. an astute observation, doctor. hey, what say, you wanna play a little touch football, toss the old pigskin around. right behind you, captain. they prepare to exit. oh, one more thing, miss piggy. a little less starch in the pajamas, ok. she almost karatechops
