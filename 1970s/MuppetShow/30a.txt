stage. kermit enters to applause. ok. thank you, thank you, thank you, and welcome to the muppet show. hey, tonight should be great because our special guest star is one of the really funny men, mr. dom deluise.  but first, we're going to open the show with our own lady of song, miss piggy, because if we don't she'll break both my arms. so here she is now, miss piggy. the curtain opens on piggy holding a birdcage. we had to move away, 'cause the rent we couldn't pay. the moving van came round just after dark. it's a great old song. there was me and my old man, shoving things inside the van, which we'd often done before, let me remark. we packed all that could be packed in the van, and that's a fact. and we got inside all we could get inside.  then we packed all we could pack on the tailboard at the back, till there wasn't any room for me to ride. my old man said, "follow the van, don't dillydally on the way." off went the cart with the home packed in it. i walked behind with my old cock linnet. but i dillied and dallied, dallied and dillied. lost the van and don't know where to roam. and you can't trust the specials like the oldtime coppers when you can't find your way home. all right, everybody, now's your chance. join in the second chorus, i'm only singing one. promises, promises.  all the audience joins in. my old man said, "follow the van, don't dillydally on the way." off went the cart with the home packed in it. i walked behind with my old cock linnet. but i dillied and dallied, dallied and dillied. lost the van and don't know where to roam. you can't trust the specials like the oldtime coppers when you can't find your way who's going my way. can't find your way home. the audience cheers wildly.  boy, they really love her, don't they. yeah. must be an easy house.  oh, no, please. oh, you're too kind. kissy, kissy. forget it. kermit's gone. oh. did it work. nope. but how about that audience i paid off for you, huh. they did just what i told them to.

scooter, oh, scooter, my dear impressionable young lad. you must understand that i am only doing this in order for the frog to notice me more.  sure, sure, and if you happen to get your own spot on the show, well, that wouldn't hurt. your life's hanging on a thread, kid. yes, ma'am. i'll go write some more spontaneous sincere fan mail for you.  mmhmm. you know the words: gorgeous, beautiful... modest. main stage. kermit enters to a fanfare. ok, tonight's guest star is dom deluise, and we all know how terrific he is. as a performer he is out of this world. as a matter of fact, right now he is on the planet koozebane. ladies and gentlemen, dom deluise. open on the planet koozebane. pan across craters. as a space rhythm plays, merdlidops pop out of craters and toot steam out their tops. one of them sees astronaut dom, who talks into a walkietalkie. 53977221. to the mothership, it's me. ah. can you see me.  here i am. yes. the one that's waving. that's nice. yes. it is so gorgeous up

oh, it's a beauty. this is a beauty. oh. oh. oh. i think i found a beauty  oh no no no, it's an immi.  never mind. he tosses the rock into a crater, which suddenly toots steam, startling him. he kneels down to investigate. holy toledo. something's afoot. oh. holy mac... a merdlidop grabs his hammer and plays a reverse whackamole game with him. wait a minute. hey, that's my hammer. hey. ooh, sheesh. the merdlidop grabs the walkietalkie and starts communicating with the others, who also have walkietalkies. merdlidop. merdlidop. merdlidop. merdlidop. merdlidop.  hey. that's not me.  dom kneels down, taps one of them on the shoulder, and grabs the walkietalkie out of its hand and sets it down.  i got you, you devil you. i fooled you, didn't i. another merdlidop smashes the walkietalkie with a hammer. don't. that's a new one. you... oh.  hello, mother ship. hello. ooh.  i think i'll go back to the mother ship now. dom sneaks away until he detects the merdlidops popping up and tooting steam. dom finally catches one and wrestles with it ah. i got ya. gimme. come on. gimme. wait a minute. hold it. ooh. the merdlidop pulls dom's arm down into the crater and pulls it out of another crater. my  ooh. my watch. quarter after six. dom pulls his arm out, and finds it limp. all the merdlidops peer out of their craters and giggle. they duck when he tries to catch them. finally, he falls down the crater, and becomes one of them. merdlidop.  applause. do you suppose they have any life on other planets. what do you care. you don't have any life on this one.  animal performs a drum solo. a few seconds after animal is through, a final note is heard that confuses him. piggy peers in. excuse me. yeah. may i use your dressing room to change in. what. well, you see, my room is all filled with flowers. you understand, don't you, my dear dominique. don't "my dear dominique" me. oh, what's wrong. i mean, i'm the guest star on this show. nobody seems to notice. the audience is filled with pig fans. piggy goes behind the dressing board, groans, and tosses a girdle. oh, what a relief. besides    they gave me this tiny little dressing room because they said the big dressing room was filled with fan mail. there's a knock on the door. would you get the door, dominique. would i get the door. i mean, i really do not believe this.  yes. a whatnot appears at the door with flowers. are you miss piggy.  no, i'm not miss piggy.. he slams the door in disgust. are those my roses. yes. they were your roses.  someone sent roses to a pig. that amuses you. ha ha ha. yes.  the days of swine and roses  knock it off, chubbo. she emerges dressed for vet's hospital. chubbo. mmhmm. look who's talking. are you saying that i am a little overweight. little. did i say little. no. i didn't say little.  you're jealous because i got all these flowers, and all you have is that little teensy basket of fruit. actually, the little, teensy basket of fruit is more suitable to you. ha. and why is that. i'll tell you why...  because...   it looks more natural.  pardon. excuse me, miss piggy, hospital sketch coming up. she karatechops dom three times, barks at him, and exits, leaving him shaken. just a minute. hold it. hold it. wait a minute. are you.... she's out of her mind. i've never seen anybody so crazy. he eats a banana. the theme music plays. a cow lies on the operating table. and now, veterinarian's hospital, the continuing stoooooory of a quack who's gone to the dogs. we want piggy. we want piggy. we want piggy. we want piggy. they cheer when she emerges. oh, thank you. thank you. thank you. thank you. oh, dr. bob... dr. bob. what. where did we get this patient from. oh, well, she was found with a bunch of cows. not bunch, herd. heard of what. herd of cows. sure, i've heard of cows. they all laugh, including the cow. no, no, no, i mean, the cow's herd. i don't care if the cow's heard. i haven't said anything to be ashamed of. they all laugh, including the cow. but dr. bob, are you going to operate. no, i think we've milked this joke long enough. they all laugh, including the cow. oh, look. i have a steak in this too, you know. they all laugh, including the cow. they look up when they hear the announcer. and so, dr. bob has taken the bull by the horns. tune in next time when you'll hear miss piggy say... this has really been a moooving experience. the audience applauds and throws flowers on the stage. oh, thank you, thank you. mwah. mwah. bless you. kiss kiss kiss. oh, thank you, thank you slim wilson and lou sing "henrietta's wedding". dr. teeth and the electric mayhem play a funky tune. if you ain't been dancin' lately, don't blame your shoes. and if you ain't been happy lately, don't put it on the blues. don't blame the dynamite, if you can't light the fuse. there's a party all the time for them what choose. the end of my romancing came with football on tv, rully. like, he ain't took me anywhere since

his head on the banister. don't tell me you liked that trash. no, my hand went to sleep.  oh.  piggy and scooter watch from upstairs as the mayhem passes by kermit. oh, here... here he comes.  and the tuba player says, "never mind about that. just be natural and bar a lemon." they laugh. ok, ok, ok.  gee, miss piggy, what are you going to do. well, i just don't know, scooter. my loyalty is, of course, to kermit. but this other show has offered me a contract at twice the money. kermit looks up at them. well, you are a superstar. oh. no, i'm not. uh   "yes, you are." oh yes. ahem yes, you are. well, i shall just have to  think about it. she shuts herself in her dressing room. uh, scooter, that performance by you and miss piggy was terrible. well  gee, i didn't think it was that bad. i missed one line but... oh, no. scooter, are you gonna tell me what's going on. no, i promised. uh, i'll give you a raise. the flowers are fake, the audience was paid off, i wrote the fan letters and miss piggy doesn't have another offer. scooter, i like your style.  open on dom in a lab. behind him is a cage with a brown monster  in it. dom addresses the viewer. ah, hello, hello and welcome. as you know, shepherd's institute of animal protection has spent the last 25 years protecting helpless, innocent animals just like the ones that you see right here. and now, in the midst of our annual fundraising drive... it's time for that drive again. he gets up and walks to the cage. doglion roams around, chained to the wall. this lovely creature has to be fed occasionally. otherwise he gets very, very... he starts feeding fruit. there you go. have a nice little snack, boy. all better. by the way, shepherd's institute has only reached its halfway mark in this year's fundraising effort. one moment, please. he goes over to a carriage, with a "baby" monster  in it. mama. this sweetheart right here has to be played with occasionally, otherwise he gets very irritable. he babbles, and tugs on baby's bonnet. you sweetheart you. good morning. a little milky, a little milky. milky. it's good. baby consumes the entire bottle. good. ok. as you can see, we care for all their needs. if an animal has a need, we fill it. doglion roars out loud. this sweetheart of a creature loves to be sung to occasionally, otherwise he gets irritable. he grabs a ukulele and sings a few bars of "ain't she sweet". very nice, very nice. all right. the point is, if you send in your donations, you'll be very happy. mean mama grows restless. dom quickly chucks the rest of the fruit into the cage. the baby monster grows restless as well. if you send in your donations, you'll be happy... here you go. he rushes over, babbles, then returns to doglion and sings again. the point is, that if you do so, these are all tax deductible... he scoops some monster food out of a bag and feeds it to mean mama while doglion manhandles him. ain't she sweet. no. wait. i'm ticklish. ain't she sweet all right, here you go, here you go. that's a beauty. you see the point is, we love them with all our hearts. we do. just a moment now. open wide. he tosses a shovelful of monster food to mean mama, then babbles to the baby, then notices that doglion is smashing the ukulele. wait a minute. ooh. holy mackerel. just...  ain't she sweet  oh. there's nothing left to eat. here. have this. he feeds the violin to mean mama, and gets pricked by a tooth. all the monsters grow restless and start trashing the lab as he addresses the viewer. by the way, all of these creatures are up for adoption. if you have a spare room in your house, give us a break. ooh. for instance, if you adopt this guy right here, you will never know the meaning of the word garbage. think about it. just a minute. hold it, hold it. mean mama grabs his coat, pulling him closer, then breaks the cage and runs loose. ain't she sweet, see her walking down the  oh. wait a minute. oh, please. whoa. my goodness. please, help. i mean, really, help. help. the monsters attack him. applause. piggy approaches kermit as he reads a book. kermie. kermie, uh, you wanted to see me. oh, uh, yes, miss piggy. you know, i couldn't help but overhear that conversation between you and scooter about that offer you got from the other show. oh, kermie, i am so sorry. i didn't want you to hear that. oh, that terrible boy. yeah, well, actually, i'm kinda glad that i did. because i have come to a decision that i think will make you very happy.  oh. i've decided to let you go.  you've what you see, piggy, i don't want to stand in your way. but... but, kermie... good luck, kid. he goes back to reading. oh. well, then i  suppose this is goodbye. oh, yes. goodbye, piggy. well uh  i'll just go clean out my dressing room, then. oh, that would be very nice. thank you. it dawns on her that he's serious. you'll... you'll explain to everyone what happened, kermie. oh, sure.  what a ham. she breaks down and rushes to him, in tears. kermie.. i can't leave you.. i can't leave you. i tried.  well, uh, does this mean you want your job back. yes oh, good. uh, uh, incidentally, though... you will have to take... you will have to take a pay cut. what. well, sure, if you can afford to pay off the audience, and buy all those flowers and the furs, and the mail and stuff, then i think you can...  you knew all the time.  main stage. kermit enters. ok, how come is it, do you suppose, that the world doesn't know that dom deluise is a singer as well as a comedian. well, let us let the world find out. ladies and gentlemen, here he is, dom deluise. the curtain opens. thank you. thank you. but may i stop for one second. i'll tell you the truth. piggy's backstage, and she's very upset. in fact she's miserable, i'd like to bring her out for just... piggy, piggy, come over here now. she enters. the audience applauds. cool it, cool it. he knew. piggy, you're upset. things have not been going very well between you and kermit today, right. dom, dom, dom. piggy. piggy, piggy. because a woman sometimes feels so alone. alone. piggy, you're not alone. look at me a minute. you're here. i'm here. us is here. us is here. i mean, we got us. cue the music. don't you understand. oh, i know. life is a funny thing. sometimes you laugh and sing. sometimes you grumble and cuss. right. the tempo picks up. but either way, what do we care. we got us. we have our ups and downs, our share of smiles and frowns, but through it all we don't fuss  why. we got a special thing goin', piggy. ha ha. we got us. some people like to go through their life single  aww. that wouldn't suit us at all. that's right. why sing a melody as a soliloquy, when it's more fun to be  harmonizing. they are joined by scooter, fozzie, gonzo, floyd, janice and the whatnot. look. it's your friends. ha ha. people may say we are, crazy the way we are  that we won't even discuss. 'cause what we got they can't smother. we'd trade our life for no other. they've only got one another, but we  got  uuuuus. applause. dom gives piggy a kiss. ok, well, that's it for another show. let's have a big thank you for our guest star, mr. dom deluise. applause. he comes out. oh yes, and thank you all for being with us, especially those of you who weren't paid off by the pig. oh. hold it  stand back, dom. this is gonna be fractured frog time.  don't. you'll regret it. don't do it. we'll see you next time on the muppet show. the credits roll as the scene ends in chaos. i wouldn't mind the show if they just got rid of one thing. what's that. me. they chuckle. ) )
