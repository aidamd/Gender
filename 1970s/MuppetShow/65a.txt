rats. open on a dark living room with a ticking grandfather clock. hickory dickory dock. the rat ran up the clock. the clock struck one.  he leads the rats in a rousing rendition of "rock around the clock." suddenly they all scurry and the music goes quiet except for the clock. catgut emerges, looks around, yawns, and goes back to sleep. the rats resume singing and dancing. in his dressing room, victor plays "the blue danube" but keeps stopping because it sounds off. something's wrong. just a minute. he pulls the sheet music from the compartment in his chair and puts it on the tray. "the blue danube." by joe strauss. he plays again, following the notation closely. it comes out the same way. i was right. he puts back the sheet music. gonzo plays "act naturally" on the ukulele, which turns into a duet with his own reflection in the mirror. hey, wait a minute. you can't do this. why not. well, you're a reflection. you're supposed to do just what i do. but you do ludicrous things. i do what. ludicrous things. of course i do. i'm an artist. and all i gotta do is, act naturally. they continue singing. gonzo's reflection dons different outfits. they finish the song. that was terrible. fozzie knocks on victor's door. come in. but you have to be very quiet because i'm practicing.  oh, mr. borge. could i come in and hear you play. yes, come right in, come right in.  oh, terrific. he slams the door, knocking down some items off the wall. be quiet. oh boy, oh boy, oh boy. i'll be real quiet. very good. very good. yeah. what're you gonna play. i'm going to play some beethoven. i'm playing the moonlight sonata by beethoven. oh, go ahead. yes. i don't think you would like it. why.  see what it says here.
