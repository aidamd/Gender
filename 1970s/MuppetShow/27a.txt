walker, isn't that right. oh, yeah. come on, i was only kidding. anyway, the show isn't that bad. it isn't. no, i mean look, the audience liked it. they all came back, they stayed. yeah. very clever of you to lock the doors.  that's cruelty to bears. listen, as for the, uh, sketches being done at the same time... yeah... do you know how many times i've seen that done. how many. how many. never. oh... you know what i do when things don't go right. no. nothing's impossible, i have found for when my chin is on the ground i pick myself up, dust myself off, and start all over again. yeah, but... nancy pulls him into a hug and continues singing "pick yourself up." ah, don't lose your confidence if you slip, just be grateful for a pleasant trip and pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and start all over again. nancy gives fozzie a kiss. oh... oh, thank you, thank you, miss walker. i feel terrific now. well, i'm glad you're happy. yeah. but listen. hmm. that's just a song. your show's in a lot of trouble. fozzie covers his face. a trumpet fanfare plays as sam the eagle steps up to his podium.  i would just like to say a few words about nudity in the world today. and i, for one, am just appalled by it. why, did you know that underneath their clothing, the entire population of the world is walking around completely naked.. hmm. is that disgusting. and it's not just people, although, goodness knows, that's bad enough. but animals too. even cute little doggies and pussycats can't be trusted. underneath their fur, absolutely naked.  and it's not just the quadrupeds either. birds, too. yes. beneath those fine feathers, birds wear nothing. nothing at all. abs...  sam covers himself and sheepishly exits. how do you feel about nudity. well, personally, it always left me cold. they laugh. nancy is in her dressing room. piggy enters. miss walker, i was wondering if i could borrow your hairbrush. oh, of course, sweetheart. come on in. oh, thank you so much. you know, i certainly do appreciate this, miss walker. oh, just call me nancy.  oh, i knew it. i just knew you'd be nice. why. 'cause i let you use my hairbrush. big deal. no, no, because of those parts you play on television. i just knew you'd be an overly considerate, protective, mothertype person. i just knew it. uh, well, i'll tell you the truth, i'm no more protective of people than anybody else. oh. i mean, that mother thing is an act. oh. the phone rings. nancy answers it. hi. oh, hello, kermit. oh, kermie, my kermie. he's sick. you're sick. oh. well, listen kermit, here's what i want you to do. yeah, i want you to drink lots of liquids. no, don't eat anything. starve a fever, feed a cold, right. get into bed, turn the electric blanket up way up high, and i'll be right over with some chicken soup. listen, what have you got. flu. oh... what kind. oh dear... no kidding, that's the worst. oh no... he's got the swine flu. oh swine flu swine flu.. take... take this, frog. piggy karatechops the phone stand off the table, disconnecting it. she leaves. i think we have kind of a bad connection here. miss piggy slams the door behind her and screams. fozzie sits at kermit's desk. scooter enters holding a paper.  hey fozzie, it's time to introduce nancy walker's musical number. oh, scooter, you do it. i can't go out on stage again. i'm too ashamed. everything's gone wrong. well, maybe this will cheer you up. why, what is this, what is this.  well, just read it. oh, all right.
