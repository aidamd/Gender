so nervous. tonight's our first formal date and i'm almost sick with fear. well, i imagine she feels much the same. oh, you think so. oh, boy. suppose i get so excited that i faint. gonzo, i just don't know. i suppose she'll have to give you mouthtomouth resuscitation. she'll have to what.. or in your case, mouthtobeak resuscitation.   gonzo, are you okay.  of course. i was just rehearsing my faint.  i hope camilla's been rehearsing hers. camilla waits in her dressing room, clucking a tune. gonzo knocks on the door. coocooroocooroo.   it's me.   hahaha. camilla, my apricot, these are for you. he hands her the flowers. she sneezes and propels herself away. oh, oh, gosh. i think  i think the room is spinning. i may faint. aaaah   how was that.   camilla.  camilla. camilla, aren't you  aren't you going to kiss me.  oh, great. just my luck. a chicken with hayfever.  well, look now, camilla, camilla, why don't i take you out for some fresh air. okay. that will make it all better. okay. camilla sits down and sighs of relief. once gonzo opens the door, she sneezes again, and propels herself out the door. camilla lands in bunsen's lab. she gets up and runs away. ahem. dr. bunsen honeydew here at muppet labs, where the future is being made today. well, jeepers, you're about to witness the world's first demonstration of fireproof paper. here is my assistant beaker, carrying a lighted blowtorch. he will now show you how impossible it is to ignite the fireproof paper in this basket. the paper ignites. beaker screams. there is no way this paper can burn. with muppets' fireproof paper, you will always feel secure. tune in next time, and witness muppet labs' new answer to the energy crisis, flammable water. beaker tries to put out the fire with a hose, but it only gets bigger. that's all for now, from muppet labs.  oh, dear.  what do you suppose they call that. a novelty act. i don't know, but it wasn't too bad. well, that's a novelty. they chuckle. piggy notices big bird entering. holy maracas. oh, hi. i'm big bird. huh. no kiddin'. i'm a friend of kermit's. oh. yeah, we both come from the same neighborhood. sesame street. oh. isn't that that cute

karatechop him, he bends over laughing, and she falls over the balcony and down the stairs. big bird looks down at her. ah. you do acrobatics, too.  she's very versatile. open on lew zealand and leslie laughing. oh, leslie, it's really a pleasure to have you on the show with us. well, thank you, lew. and it's a thrill for me to work with a boomerangfish thrower. well, i should think so. heehee. listen, lew, what does it take to become a great boomerangfish thrower. well, you gotta have sole.  and if you can't get sole, use halibut.  i should have guessed. but in that case, i use a catcher's mitt. why. no, no, don't tell me. let me guess. uh, just for the halibut. hee. you're catching on. heeheehee. listen, how did you acquire this talent. was it an accident. no, it was on porpoise. heeheehee. i give him the straight lines and he gives me the fish lines. hehheh. you know, i started this act using kippers. my brother and i did the act together, but we split up. why. hey  am i my brother's kipper. listen. i gotta quit this and sing my song. oh, great idea. i'll accompany you on fish. music swells up. well, lew, i was kind of expecting violins.  well, what the heck. yeah. leslie sings "here you come again" while lew throws a fish and it comes back to him. two at once. all right. he throws two at once and they come back. fascin   i love this.  whoo. fun, fun, fun. watch this one. '   oh, this is fabulous. swordfish this time.  lew throws three swordfish in a row. leslie backs against the wall, and the three of them hit the wall close to her. ma. applause. she bows. that reminds me. this show has always reminded me of a sardine. why. it's a little fishy. they chuckle. a swordfish lands in their box. miss piggy sings "mad about the frog" with rowlf backing her up on piano, joined by a whatnot violinist. the opening montage plays. and now, bear on patrol. link touchtypes on the typewriter. fozzie drags in a pig suspect. all right, all right, come on. you just come with me, you... you... sir  sir, sergeant, i have just picked up this very dangerous cr in a minute, patrol bear. i have to finish this report.  oh, drat, i made a mistake. now i'll have to start all over again.  but sir, can't that report wait. no, this is a very serious charge. what is it. littering.  sir, sir, this also is a very serious charge. oh, yeah. what's the charge. impersonating an officer. can you prove it. of course i can prove it, sergeant. go ahead, do your stuff. okay, impersonating an officer. drumroll.  ahh. of course i can prove it, sergeant. go ahead, do your stuff. ahh. hey, that's not bad. thank you. yep, now look, sergeant, this is a very dangerous criminal. he should be locked up. i think he should be locked up. here are the keys. i'll finish up the report. i'm going to lock him up. well, i should've known better than to try to fool with you, patrol bear. yeah, you're darn tootin'. fozzie unlocks the cell. the pig opens it. after you. thank you. he walks in the cell. the pig locks him in. listen, tell me what kind of food you like and i'll... ahem.  uh, see you later, sarge.  right. aahhh. sergeant, wait a minute. he locked me in.  not bad. you sound more like him all the time. now try to do me. oh. sergeant, you don't understand. he got away. no, that's not me. you still sound like that dumb bear that brought you in here. try it again. i have a deep, authoritative voice. sergeant, will you just turn around, please.. better, but keep tying. you need more macho. link continues typing. tell me, gonzo, what is it about camilla that first attracted you to her. are you kidding. everything. she's beautiful, witty, charming, delightful company, a good cook, and she's very talented. really. what does she do.  camilla. camilla does a flamenco dance as gonzo and other chickens watch. arriba.  cha cha cha. oh, wow. yeah. well, i would've thought that was impossible. what, to get a chicken to dance. no, to find tap shoes for claws. a man walks by a vending machine with eyes. hello. i am vendawish. deposit a coin and i will answer any wish you may have. the man deposits a coin. thank you. now, please state your wish and i will grant it. uh, i wish i was taller. taller. yeah. two robotic hands reach out and stretch the man's neck about two feet high. the man walks away. next. gonzo gets ready to serenade camilla, who sits on a balcony. camilla, i have written a song for you. oh, sinatra or mick jagger will probably wanna record it. but i want you to hear it from me first. aww. he plays the ukulele and sings. you alone, you are my one and only chicken steady.  and if you leave i will alone and lonely sicken, ready.  you and i we're a team and that's a fact. you and i what a terrific idea for an act. oh, listen to the rhymes in the chorus. it's very cole portery. camilla you're sweeter than wine or vanilla. camilla come lie beneath this tree, it's a willa. camilla  camilla the night it grows stilla and stilla. camilla you're prettier by far than godzilla. camilla. enter big bird. gonzo does a take. who are you. huh. me. wow. perfection incarnate. wow. statuesque, and yet still poultry in every sense. camilla looks uneasy. you have that one thing lacking in chickens.  bulk. i'm so confused. you are so huge. well, i have no idea what you're talking about, sir. i was just looking for miss uggams. and you found me. lady luck has smiled and showered us with that certain thing... camilla knocks a flower pot over. it lands on gonzo's head. flower pot. hmph. oh, please, dr. honeydew, i can't go through life with this long neck. never fear, at muppet labs we have done extensive research on shortening long necks. then you can help. of course. this is our latest therapy technique. he takes out a baseball bat, swings at the man, and the man ducks, shrinking his neck to its normal height. the man faints. don't thank me. it's all in a day's work. kermit runs towards the stage, and trips over the man on the floor. please, dr. honeydew, don't leave a mess backstage. if you're through playing with him, put him away. main stage. kermit enters to a fanfare. and now, once again, here is our very special guest, who will be joined by a very tall feathered friend who just wandered in off the street  uh, sesame street, to be precise. ladies and gentlemen, big bird and leslie uggams. in a forest clearing, birdwatchers leslie and big bird sneak up on each other and sing "love will keep us together", joined by other birds. okay. well, i think we've just about come down to the end of another one, but before we go, let us have a warm thank you for our very special guest star, the lovely leslie uggams. yaaay. applause as she comes out. gonzo follows an angry camilla. thank you, kermit. listen, chicky babe, you've gotta forgive me. i'll never talk to another chicken again. another chicken approaches him. oh, hi, camilla. gahh camilla.. gonzo, you're quite a shocker. i thought that camilla was your one true love. oh, yeah, uh, well, uh, chickens all look the same to me. the two chickens start pecking him. girls, please. well, i'd like to thank a really different looking chicken, big bird from sesame street. oh, thank you, thank you. hey, we'll see you next time on the muppet show. the other muppets gather as the credits roll. the chickens return to join statler and waldorf. have we ever said that this show is for the birds. yes, and we'll keep saying it until it gets a laugh. the chickens laugh with them. ) )
