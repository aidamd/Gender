baffled, but goes to the altar anyway. the pig minister arrives at the altar. meanwhile in the wings, marisa stands with piggy, dressed in bridal regalia. oh. oh, marisa, do i look all right. you look radiant, my dear. oh. she kisses piggy. piggy makes her way to the altar, nervously. rowlf plays "here comes the bride". uh, you sure this is gonna be funny. trust me. dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to join this pig and this frog in holy wedlock. the pigs cry. in the wings, animal stands by marisa, also crying. i guess everyone cries at weddings.  no, cries at weddings. oh.  if there is anyone present who knows why this pig and this frog should not be joined in matrimony, let him speak now, or forever hold his peace. the frogs murmur. a mother pig smacks her child. do it. do you, piggy, take this frog to be your lawfully wedded husband.  i do. and do you, kermit, take this pig to be your lawfully wedded wife. piggy nods. i    i  piggy nods. kermit starts nodding with her.  i wanna introduce to you, the amazing lew zealand and his boomerang fish. lew takes the stage and starts throwing fish as vaudevillian music plays. piggy chases kermit around the church as wayne sings an aria and nearly catches a fish in his mouth. the scene ends in chaos, with fish being thrown around willynilly by everyone. marisa catches a fish and giggles. this is a comedy sketch, after all. well, it is now.  kermit. we'll see if you laugh with a flipper crammed down your throat. the chase resumes. close the curtains. close the curtains. the curtains close. kermit comes out. uh, and so we
