contents the dressing room. scooter knocks and enters, wearing a tux. rudolf nureyev, uh, rudolf nureyev. fifteen seconds, mr.  nureyev. the room is empty.  uhhuh. i knew he was too smart to show up. it's the muppet show, with our special guest star, mr. rudolf nureyev. the curtain opens, and the theme begins. statler and waldorf scat along to the theme. a green balloon comes out of gonzo's trumpet, inflating mostly on its own. gonzo bats it with his nose. kermit, also wearing a tux, explores the heavily decorated backstage area. boy, sam really has this place looking good for rudolf nureyev. yeah, well, i don't mind that so much, but me and robin are mad we have to wear these formal clothes. you and robin. where's robin. oh, right here. he briefly lifts up a top hat to reveal robin. it's the only hat i could find. attenhut. they stand at attention. beg pardon. line up for inspection. inspection. yes. we must look proper for mr. nureyev. at last, to have a man of dignity, a man of culture on this weird, sick program.  did you wash your flippers. uh, yes, sir. let's have a look. he lifts kermit's left foot, and kermit loses his balance and falls. will you please get off the floor.  will you  will you comb your hair and polish those shoes.  ah, yes, sir. yes, sir. and one more thing   your hat's too big. uh, sam, can i introduce the show now. of course, yes, but just do it with dignity.  uh, yes, yes  oh. to have the brilliant, talented rudolf nureyev on our show.  he's my favorite opera singer.  main stage. kermit enters to applause. thank you, thank you, thank you. hi there and welcome to the muppet show. you call that dignity. uh, i'm sorry, sam.  uh, ahem. uh, ladies and gentlemen, it is indeed an honor... good. to welcome you to the muppet show.  uh, tonight's guest star is one of the world's great masters of the ballet, mr. rudolf nureyev. wwait  are you sure it's ballet, not opera. positive. six of one, half dozen the other. culture is culture. go ahead. uh... ahem. uh, but here to get things started is dr. teeth and the electric... what  dr. teeth... sam, i know i promised you a very cultural show. but don't worry, you see, they're playing a minuet, and they have promised to be very classy. may i have that in writing.  just get off  the mayhem plays "minuet in g major". hey. hey, what's this bummer called again. "minuet in g major". huh. oh. they ought to send it back to the minors.  yeah, if i knew we were gonna do this, i'd have just stayed home and sent in my suit.  animal's not gonna make it, man. he's gonna freak.  if he goes, i go with him. animal goes wild on the drums. it's a breakout. the mayhem goes wild along with him. applause. you know, the older i get, the more i appreciate good music. yeah. what's that got to do with what we just heard. nothing, just thought i'd mention it. they chuckle. the mayhem passes by kermit. not very cultural, guys. not very cultural. that was degrading. that was awful. mr. nureyev must be shocked. well, i doubt it. well, of course he is. he is sensitive. he is creative. he is artistic. he is not here. what. no, no, it's ok. he just phoned in, he's running a little bit late. oh. thank goodness. now, remember, when mr. nureyev arrives, we must be dignified, we must be respectful. rudolf, dressed casually, enters. applause. hi, you guys. ah. i'm here. not for long, you are not. we are waiting for mr. nureyev. but sam  i'll handle this.  get out of here, you freak. you hippie. you weirdo, get out. move, move. get a haircut.  who do these punk kids think they are. that  that one thinks he's rudolf nureyev.  what. in fact, that was rudolf nureyev.  what have i done. i think i'll go out and introduce something cultural. sam is distressed. main stage. kermit enters to a fanfare. uh, uh, now in keeping with our tone of uh, culture and classicism, and to uh, kill time while we see if we still have a guest star, we proudly present the love duet from the third act of the barber of die fliedremaus. uh, by giusseppe vagner...or giusseppe wagner. um... whatever. the curtain opens. dressed in armor, link and piggy perform a duet of "la ci darem la mano" from "don giovanni". eventually, sam uses a giant magnet on a rope to lift them offstage.  i hope mr. nureyev didn't see that. he accidentally lets go of the rope. klang. the pigs fall down. you know, there's nothing like grand opera. yep, and that was nothing like it. they chuckle.  mr. nureyev, will you ever forgive me. uh, he forgives you, sam. what. i just talked to him. he isn't angry, he's putting on his costume for his big ballet number. oh.  bless you, frog. oh, thank you for these glad tidings. and what ballet, may i ask, is the incomparable mr. nureyev going to perform. uh, "swine lake".  uh, ladies and gentlemen, in the classic ballet "swine lake", a beautiful princess has been turned into a pig by the wicked magician, trichinosis. ahem. uh, unfortunately, the handsome prince  there's a handsome prince in this too  the handsome prince hasn't heard about the change. here, then, the very princely, mr. rudolf nureyev. applause. an instrumental of "swan lake" is played as rudolf dances. when the ballerina pig shows up, he tosses her aside. the dancing continues, and concludes with one final toss. applause. a whatnot who is literally missing much from his life sings "something's missing." in the end, a female whatnot joins him, making his life whole. in the operating room, the cast tries to make themselves look as distinguished as possible. a young pig is on the operating table. and now, veterinarian's hospital. on this special episode, our quack who has gone to the dogs will pay tribute to william shakespeare. prithee, nurse, who beith our next patient. why, this little piglet, sire. not piglet, hamlet. they all laugh. remember, we're doing shakespeare here. hmm, sounds more like bacon. they all laugh. say, this patient needs a transfusion. what's his blood type. well, i think it's 2b, but i'm not sure. well, make up your mind. 2b or not 2b. he and janice laugh. gadzooks, they have no shame.  say  i'm listening to this patient's heart. zounds. zounds what. zounds terrible. they all laugh. hey, the frog wanted shakespeare, he's getting shakespeare. but you're a doctor first. right, doctor first, richard the second, henry the fourth. they all laugh. methinks we should take our leave. why. look at the time. they all look around. hey, the timing of the shrew. are you calling me a shrew. if the shrew fits... they all laugh, and look up when they hear the announcer. and so we leave veterinarian's hospitalonavon. tune in next week when you'll hear dr. bob say ... alas, poor pork, i knew thee well. they all laugh. now that really offended me. i'm a student of shakespeare. eh. you were a student with shakespeare. ahem. kermie. uh, yes, miss piggy. may i speak with you about our duet. uh, what, is something wrong with it. wrong. why it's wonderful.  oh, at last, a mature and passionate love duet between me and my kermie. ah, well, you're not doing it with me. what. no, you're gonna do it with rudolf nureyev. a beat. she drops him and runs over him. coming, rudy. kermit gets up, dazed. main stage. robin enters to a fanfare. my uncle kermit can't make the next introduction. he's trying to get the spiked heel marks off his throat. so i guess i'll fill in. here, once again, the multitalented rudolf nureyev. sam removes robin's hat. uh, yeah, i know. the hat's still too big. they both walk away. the curtain opens on a sauna, where piggy sits by herself. rudolf enters and disrobes except for his towel. holy maracas.  uh, mmhmm, helloooo.  uh, don't you, uh, talk to strangers. depends on how strange the stranger is.  oh, what a wonderful sense of humor you have. and you have a marvelous mind. and the other parts ain't bad, either.  just think of it. last week i've been dancing with natalia makarova. and today, i'm in a steam room with a lady pig. oh, yes. and isn't it heaven. i don't think heaven is this warm. it's more like the other place. uh, well, uh, ahem, if you're warm, maybe you're overdressed. no, i'm fine. maybe i'm overdressed. that's it, i'm leaving. oh, no, sweetie, you just got here. pleeeeease. music swells up. you don't understand  they begin a duet of "baby, it's cold outside". in the end, piggy is left only with his towel and a rudolf nureyevshaped hole in the wall.  boy, he's really good, that rudolf nurey... uh, nureyey... you know, i should really learn to pronounce his name. oh, don't bother now. after this show, he'll probably change it. they chuckle. rowlf plays "clair de lune" on the piano. fozzie approaches.  you forgot your candelabra. i'll go get it. keep playing. sounds terrific. fozzie fetches the candelabra and puts it on the piano.  got a match. a match. a match for the candle...   ok. fozzie fetches a matchbox and tries to strike one.  lighter, lighter. gonzo... fozzie fetches a lighter and tries to light it.  it doesn't work   it doesn't... he briefly leaves, then comes back. uh, rowlf, i think it's all taken care of. you're gonna have a beautiful candle to play with. he attempts to light it with a blowtorch. fabulous.  give it time. he melts the candelabra instead. rowlf facepalms. uh, sorry about that. gonzo.  rudolf stands behind the changing board. rudolf, i want to tell you how delighted we are to have you on our show tonight. i'm having a great time. oh, good. i'm afraid your friend, the eagle, isn't too pleased. oh, that's just sam. don't worry about him.  mr. nureyev, may i have your attention. yes. well... maybe i'm not too sure. i just want to apologize for thedisgusting things the frog has forced you to do on this show. uh, the frog did not force him.  humph. the frog didn't force me. what. no. i wanted to do them. and it was fun. i can't believe that i'm speaking to the real rudolf nureyev. does that mean you're going to throw me out again. no, no, no  of course not. no. good. there's one more number i'd like to do. aha. i should have known. the first two for the lowbrow element, but for your finale, a brilliant interpretation of classic ballet. exactly. he emerges in a black tux. is that a ballet costume. trust me, sam. you see... he launches into a rendition of "top hat, white tie and tails". the other muppets join him as he taps out of the room and onto the stage. okay, so once again we come now to the end of another show. so let us have a warm thank you for our very special guest star, the incomparable rudolf nureyev. yaaaayy. applause. this has been a very different experience for me. mr. nureyev, i just want you to know that i am sorry. you are sorry you threw me out. no, i'm sorry i ever let you back in.  this has been shocking. aw, cool it, baldy.  okay, we'll see you all next time on the muppet show. leave me alone. the banter continues as the credits roll. now, wasn't that a cultural show. waldorf is asleep. statler shrugs and joins him. ) )
