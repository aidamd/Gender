the chef looks under the chicken and finds two more pingpong balls.   n gg du chf  chcke du chf. he salts the chicken, then chases it around the kitchen with the frying pan. he briefly strums the pan like a ukulele, then the chase resumes. hey. let's sneak out and have a pizza. statler nods. they sneak out. kermit, uh, i know you like to make your guests feel at home on the show, but don't you think a piano in the dressing room is overdoing it a little. oh. well, you see, i've been meaning to talk to you about this piano. uh, you see, we've got a gofer around here and, uh... we've had frogs, chickens and now a gopher. uh, oh yeah, you see, that's an old theatrical term. a gofer is somebody you have around to "go fer" coffee. isn't that interesting. no. yeah, well, you see, this gofer of ours, uh, well, he's found a song he wants you to do on the show. mm. oh, kermit, i thought you were more professional than that. oh, i'm i'm sorry, elton, but the kid has taste, he's got talent, and he's got an uncle who owns the theater. please. oh, please. okay, okay, let's hear it. okay, scooter, come on in. get it over with. scooter and the other muppets rush in. okay, chief. come on, elton, sit down. make yourself comfortable. you'll love it. ready. one two three four. scooter starts playing the piano and the muppets all start singing out of tune. hold it. stop. hold it. hold it, hold it. scooter, i told  i told you you elton wouldn't like that song. that song is tasteless. that song has no melody. that  isn't  isn't that the worst song you've ever heard, elton. well, i didn't think so when i wrote it. you wrote that song. yep. oh. it's a rather interesting song. it's got a nice little melody.  you really hated it, huh. well, uh... yeah. well, it can sound different. it can. yeah, let me show you. let's hear it. elton performs "bennie and the jets". the muppets join in. open on piggy attempting to blow up the balloon pump through a tube. she makes her way to the table, hiccuping. time once again for veterinarian's hospital, the continuing stoooory of a quack who's gone to the dogs. here's the next patient, dr. bob. rowlf uncovers baskerville on the table. it's a dog. i hope he doesn't have fleas. why not. i hate to start from scratch. they all laugh. what kind of dog is he, dr. bob. ask him what time it is. why. he might be a watch dog. they all laugh. of course, he could be a guard dog. you know, i know a woman who was once attacked by her own guard dog. doberman pinscher. no, doberman bit her. they all laugh. hey, where did you find him. at the lost and hound department. they all laugh. oh, i wish he was a dachshund. why. i'd like to get a long little doggy. they all laugh. and so once again, dr. bob has taken the bulldog by the horns. tune in next week when you'll hear nurse piggy say... dr. bob, i think the patient is running a fever. oh. well, go get some mustard. mustard. that's what you always put on a hot dog. piggy and janice groan and walk away. kermit, fozzie and a pair of whatnots sing "any old iron". ladies and gentlemen... the chef chases the chicken across the stage, now holding a meat cleaver. anyway, kermit's allowed me to do an introduction to our guest star tonight. but i promised not to get carried away, so i'll be very understated. here he is, the greatest talent in the history of the universe, elton john. yaaayyy. elton and the electric mayhem perform "goodbye yellow brick road." they all sigh. oh, the endless sameness of eternal space. a pig could go mad. we only blasted off twenty minutes ago. that long. at least we could have brought a tv set. i'm missing all my favorite bowling shows. you  you and your bowling shows.  he cries at the sad parts. strangepork laughs. a red light bulb flashes. uh, doctor. hmm. uh, what does that red light mean. oh, the red light means stop, the green light means go, the yellow light no, no, no, no. not traffic lights, you twit. that light on the console. oh, that light. that means we've been invaded by alien beings.  oh.  what... yes, even now hideous creatures of some sort are roaming the ship. oh. oh, help. do something, miss piggy. if they're like snakes i'll scream. you're the captain, fatso. according to the sensors, there are two creatures. two. two snakes. i'll just die.  will you please. yes, here's the readout. one is very frightened and has feathers. the other speaks some sort of strange scandinavian tongue. the swedish chef enters, still chasing the chicken around the ship. aliens. alien beings in the control room. alien beings in the control room. help. oh, they're hideous creatures loose in the control room. they leave. the boredom returns. well, they're gone. somehow, i miss them. oh, the endless sameness of eternal space. they all sigh. the chicken, now holding the meat cleaver, chases the chef past kermit. kermit. about this elton john. yeah. i have seen some pretty weird guests on this show, but this elton john borders on the revolutionary. uh, well, sam, elton john is a very important musician. then why does he dress like a stolen car. uh, sam, musicians have always been fancy dressers. mozart wasn't. mozart wore high heels and wigs and silk stockings.  hold your little green tongue. it's true, sam. huh  if mozart wore high heels, wigs and stockings, i'll eat my hat. and uh, give elton john a big introduction.  that, too. hey, guys. look at this great picture of mozart elton john gave me. love those high heels and silk stockings. what. sam, you know, you'd look great in a powdered wig. good grief. i've been hornswoggled. okay guys, come on in. some whatnots enter with a dressing board. kermit joins them as they shove sam behind it. main stage. sam is pushed onstage, wearing a flashy outfit. do i have to do this. yes, you do, sam. a bet is a bet. all right. um, let's see.  "i am proud to introduce one of the great names in popular music. one of my all time favorites"  elton john. and. all right. he starts eating his hat as he and kermit walk offstage. the curtain opens on elton, backed by the mayhem. all right. there's a wonderful lady that i have always wanted to work and sing with. so will you please give a great reception to the fantastic miss piggy. applause as she emerges. oh, thank you. kissy, kissy. kissy to you all. oh, elton, have you been waiting long, poopsie. it seems like an eternity. of course it does. ready. umhmm. they do a duet of "don't go breakin' my heart".  eat your heart out, kiki. she showers him with kissykissys. applause.  hey, we look like members of the rock age. no, we look more like members of the stone age. they chuckle. kermit and the rest of the gang have adopted elton's bizarre sense of style. well, that's about all the time we have. boy, are we gonna have some wardrobe bill. but we're gonna save on the light bill. that's true. hey, but once again, let's bring out our special guest star and the man who caused all this, mr. elton john. yaaayy. applause. elton emerges in a normal outfit. boy, elton, you look weird. well, you guys are all dressed like stolen cars. hey, we'll see you next time on the muppet show. the banter continues as the credits roll. well, what did you think. the frightened chef pops up and runs away from the cleaverwielding chicken. i hate running gags. ) )
