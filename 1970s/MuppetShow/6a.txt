television, the mother of six on the brady bunch, and the mother of her own bunch of four at home, our guest for the evening, the lovely miss florence henderson. florence fades in and out of a misty forest as she sings "elusive butterfly". as the song comes to a close, she disappears for the last time, her tiedyed muumuu dissolving into a collection of multicolored butterflies. the borcellino brothers pass kermit, now wearing bandages. i told you not to let fatso on the top. well don't blame me, pop, i'm only a young pig.  uh, pigs. listen, pigs. will you guys get out of here, please. come

uh, no. because i want to make you happy. uh, good. when you're happy, the pig is happy. uh, wonderful. oh, my love. my life. she starts vigorously making out with him, grunting. kermit is disgusted when she finishes. forgive me for being so forward, but i'm a liberated pig. ta.  must be my animal musk.  couples dance in a ballroom. george dances with mildred, hitting her in the chin. two, three, four, two, three... you know, the trouble with kids today is they don't know what they want. when i was a kid, i never wanted that. piggy dances wildly with another pig. they're just a couple of floor hogs. yeah.  uh, i don't know, maybe it's the wine talking in fact, i'm sure it is but you're beautiful.  rowlf dances with a woman. aw, tell me the truth. you really don't like dancing with a dog, do you. what makes you say that. it's that flea collar you're wearing. george sways mildred across the floor. two rats dance. i think we ought to move out of the ghetto and find ourselves a nice little dump in the suburbs. oh, honey, i love you like the plague. the loud lady dances with the green man.  can we take this moment to announce our engagement. ehh, why not.  oh. we're engaged.  i've waited so long. we're engaged. kermit and florence gaze in each others' eyes. florence, your eyes are like two limpid pools. oh, that's very sweet, kermit. and when i look into your eyes, i'm spellbound. and when i look into those eyes i see... i see... enter piggy, behind florence. yes. come on, tell me what you see. i see trouble. hm, hm, hm. well, well, well. while the pig's away, the frog will play, hm.  hi, piggy. don't "hi, piggy" me, you frog stealer. piggy, you have it all wrong there. you see... in a pig's eye i mean, in a person's eye. yes, you do have it wrong, piggy. oh. yes. kermit was just practicing on me what he really wants to say to you.  uh, what.  you mean it. no. oh, kermit. oh.  my love. my love. my life. oh, i am like putty in your hands. putty. putty.  cement mixer  piggy reacts with a blank stare, dropping kermit.  nothing.  what what happened. what happened. piggy. piggy, come here a minute. yes. listen. can i give you a little tip. oh, no. there's no need for that. i'm well paid. no. i mean about men. oh, my dear, i'm sure you know about men. but uh, ahem  honey, make one move toward that frog's bod... piggy, kermit and i are old friends, honest. you mean there's nothing.... no, we're just... it's just platonic, really. oh. oh. oh, thank you so much. thank you. oh, i'm off to find my love. oh, oh, oh.   she's crazy.  has she gone.  yes.  she's off to find her love. she begins karatechopping and biting florence while kermit flinches. piggy. stop it  rowlf plays piano. when i was a puppy, i used to enjoy reading about "winnie the pooh." he's a bear, like fozzie bear. but, not very much like fozzie bear. this is a song he would sing when somebody would say something he didn't quite understand. he could've said, "what." or "i beg your pardon." but, pooh would instead sing this song, which he made up for singing when his his brain felt fluffy. goes like this... rowlf performs "cottleston pie." as he finishes the first verse... now, this is where the song changes key. what we call a "modulation." that's g sharp minor.  open on the panel chatting with each other. okay. uh, time once again, friends, to raise the intellectual level of our program, as our panel discusses questions of lasting importance. and our guest tonight is miss florence henderson. thank you. good evening, everyone. hey, baby. mmhm.  okay. and tonight's question is. one that has bothered scholars everywhere: "was william shakespeare, in fact, bacon."  is this some kind of bad joke. iii don't understand, piggy. bacon, my love, bacon. i am tired of these continual pig slurs. oh. you know, we pigs have feelings too. oh, no, no, no, no. you see, i meant francis bacon. france's bacon, italy's bacon, czechoslovakia's bacon. who cares. it's all bad taste. oh, no. bacon tastes real good. i had some this morning. really made a pig of myself.   that does it. pigs of the world, unite. piggy. please, piggy. we don't have time for that now. yeah. besides, you're always hogging the time. get it. hogging.  she beats him to the ground. wait a minute. hold it, hold it, hold it. wait a minute. piggy, come on, now. can we get back to the subject at hand. miss piggy, please.  i'm sorry. get back over there. okay, the subject in hand. florence. well, there's no question in my mind. as to what. nothing. there's no question in my mind.  no answer either. we have a saying in my country: "a woman who laughs at her own jokes seldom has branches on her shoetrees." that is the dumbest thing i've ever heard. so, don't visit our country. floyd and piggy begin arguing. please. the topic is... the topic is: "were shakespeare's works actually written by francis bacon." the borcellino brothers mob kermit. all right, all right. listen. we've been listening offstage and we've had enough of this garbage about bacon. right. we pigs are true artists. miss henderson, would you like to see our acrobatic act. why, yes, i'd love to. no, no, you don't want to see the acrobatic act... a drumroll sounds as the pigs pile on top of each other and quickly topple. and one, and... whoa, whoa, whoa. can we get these pigs outta here it's cute. cute act.  i'm sorry about that, miss henderson, but... listen, we'll be back next week with another vital question for our panel: "do attack dogs make good house pets." rufus attacks kermit as the closing music plays. the scene ends in chaos.  wha  wake me when the show starts. it's already been on a while. oh. wake me when it's over. the chaos continues backstage, with the pigs, zoot, hilda and wayne all arguing with each other. hey  we got to get organized around here. will somebody tell those pigs to knock it off.  knock it off.  knock it off.  knock it off. now will we knock off the knockingitoffs.  knock off the knockingitoffs.  knock off the knockingitoffs.  knock off the knockingitoffs. oh, kermit, every time you yell it sends a shudder through my body. wonderful. i tremble with desire and uncontrollable passion. yeah.  in you, i see a seething volcano, ready to erupt like vesuvius and explode  we have a show to do. will you get out of here. yes.  he loves me.  i give up. i knew you
