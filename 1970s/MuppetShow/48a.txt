"party of the first part guarantees to give party of the second part fabulous riches and worldwide fame." kermit, what is this contract. oh, that... oh, that... that just belongs to alice. that's, uh... uh, you know the faust story. no. okay, well, you see, faust sold his soul to the devil, and in return, became very rich and very famous, and alice says that this is that kind of a contract. really. where do i sign.. i've gotta get a pen. a monster passes by gonzo. hey, give me a pen. i'll give you a chicken for it. uhuh.  i'll give you all my chickens for a pen. i'd sell my soul for a pen  no. i have other plans for that. a pen. i gotta have a pen. somebody. fozzie. scooter. open on a cave with talking stalagmites. ooh. i've never known a toothache this bad before. he's never known a toothache this bad before. it's like having toothache all over my body. it's like having toothache all over his body. and another thing. and another thing. i keep hearing voices.  and what's worse... and what's worse... ...the echo is often incorrect.   shh. and sometimes... and sometimes it says what i'm going to say before i've said it. ...it says what i'm going to s... yeah, well yeah, well, none of this is helping my toothache. you took the words right out of my mouth. pity you couldn't take the teeth as well. who was that. don't look at us. zoom out on the cave, which is actually a mouth. the stalagmites are actually the teeth of a larger stalagmite. whoa. i've never known a toothache this bad before. he's never known a toothache this bad before. it's like having toothache all over my body. it's like having toothache all over... and another... synthetic music ends the piece. alice adds more eyeshadow to his face. mr. cooper. yes. i don't believe it.  ahem. let me come right to the point. you, sir, are a demented, sick, degenerate, barbaric, naughty...   freako. why, thank you.  freakos: one, civilization: zero. alice licks his finger and makes an invisible "1" with it. fozzie and some whatnots dine. who ordered the spider sandwich. oh. oh, gladys, this show is so weird tonight. i'm gonna stay right down here in the canteen with these cleancut kids. the whatnots laugh, showing their sharp teeth.  why can't we have one thing nice on this show tonight. robin grants fozzie's wish with a performance of "over the rainbow." oh, boy, this is a spooky show. the candle moves towards him while he's not looking. when he turns his head, it stops. kermit hides, then blows the candle out when it least expects. think about that, folks. the candle flees. not you. masked heads pop up around kermit as the lights dim. they follow him until he runs away. a blue frackle, wearing one of the masks, sings "once a year day" and is joined by other masked muppet monsters. a spirit plays a theremin while thog dances. open on a closeup of a candle flame. alice's face appears superimposed in it. and, with the power vested in me, i have touched you and made you beautiful. let no man call you ugly. transition to alice in a room with beakie, an abstract rainbow monster. with me at your side, we will lead a life of eternal happiness. they sing "you and me." hey. excuse  who turned off the lights.  miss piggy wanted onstage for pigs in space.  i'll be right there. ahem. pardon moi, alicimo. ahem.  what. what the.... hey. all right, listen, cooper, the deal is off. make with the magic. oh, all right.  all right. poof. oh, all right, all right. that's better. and you can tell your man i wouldn't sell you my soul if you paid me. creep.  alice uses a ham radio. yeah, hello, boss. no, no, i didn't make a sale. uh, listen, do i get any commission on hourly rentals. the radio shoots a flame. whew. touchy. first mate piggy, help me move link back to the electro cosmotron. yes. yes. they grunt as they move him in his chair. it's like king kong. easy, yeah, good, good. whew. oh, doctor, does he stand a chance. well, i hesitate to try this shock treatment. it's very dangerous, and it could kill him. oh. is there no alternative. well, you could give him mouthtomouth resuscitation. a beat. you connect the wires, i'll throw the switch. mmmhmm. ready. so... just... now, all connected. three... two... one. she throws the switch. link becomes transparent and wakes up. oh. look, dr. strangepork, he's coming around. yes, it worked. uh, turn it off now, first mate piggy. yes.  uh, dr. strangepork, what happened.  oh, uh, just temporary, link.  i said turn it off. i  i did. uhoh. sorry, link. but look at me. i'm just a shell of my former self. but, uh... but, uh, uh... oh, you're much more interesting. mmm. no, i think he looks weird. of course he looks weird. i'm just tying to make him feel better, dummo. huh. do you really think i look more interesting.  yes, dear. well, in that case, how about a little kissykissy. what.. hmm. he kisses her on the snout, and she also becomes transparent. look what you did.  funny. i look more interesting, but you look weird.  oh, shut up, strangepork. i'll do something to help as soon as i can shtop laughing.  she karatechops him, and he becomes transparent as well. oh, no. swinekopf. look what you've done to me. oh no. dr. strangepork. oh no. something's happening to the spaceship. the ship's interior becomes transparent as the commotion ensues. eh, what did you think of that. out of sight. you mean you liked it. no, it was out of sight. i had my eyes closed. they chuckle. main stage. kermit enters to a fanfare. and now, for one last time, alice cooper. alice and the monsters sing a rowdy version of "school's out." well, it's been a little strange tonight, even for us. but before we all go home and hide under the bed, uh, let us bring out our very special guest star, alice cooper. applause. alice fades in. the other muppets from the closing number flock him. you were great. yeah. kermit, it's been a real pleasure. thunder and lightning startle them.  this is the voice of doom. sounds more like the voice of gonzo. poof. gonzo appears on stage with a paper. gonzo. is that the contract with the devil. uh, no, it's worse than that. this is the bill from special effects. they all groan and writhe in agony. i don't want to think about it. we'll see you next time on the muppet show. nuts. the agony continues as the credits roll. so that was alice cooper. you should see his sister, james fennimore. they chuckle. ) )
