ahah, and you can put on the rest of your clothes.  time for decisive action. kermit emerges with the flowers. oh, linda. i got some flowaah. piggy throws him in the steamer trunk and locks it. that should be decisive enough.   help. help. help. on stage, the horse dangles the watch in front of the hypnotized bugsy and snickers. piggy shoos them away as a fanfare plays, then drags the swedish chef onstage. get off. off. get off. get off. uh, ladies and gentlemen, kermit has asked a friend of his to introduce  what'sherface. ahem.  uh    lnd rnstdt.  yy. the curtain opens on a cabin in the middle of a swamp. floyd, janice, animal, zeke and some frogs accompany linda as she sings "blue bayou". oh, i thought that bayou number was okay, didn't you. well, it's okay by me if it's okay bayou. they chuckle. open on the chef, with a champagne bottle on the table. he plays with a glass as he sings.   brk brk brk. he tosses the glass away, and addresses the bottle.   de bbblbbbl.  de frst, pppn de crkn. he struggles to open the bottle. finally, the cork propels him into the air. fade to the newsroom. here is a muppet news flash.  local citizens have reported the sighting of an unidentified flying object. when last seen, it was directly over the muppet newsroom. plop. the chef falls on the newsman. rowlf plays the banjo and sings. a terrier in the house behind him plays the fiddle. little bennie had a cat that they wouldn't let him keep, so he put her up for sale at a price he thought was cheap. he took her to a neighbor to ask him for advice. he said leave the kitty here. she can help me with the mice. he takes gaffer away, and she walks back to the porch. but the cat came back, she wouldn't stay away. she was sitting on the porch the very next day. the cat came back, she didn't want to roam. the very next day it was home, sweet home. rover joe pulls up in a yellow truck and drives off with gaffer. then bennie met a man who was driving way out west. he would take the cat along as a special honored guest. the steering wheel was wobbly, he drove into a tree  the car was just a total wreck as anyone could see  but the cat came back, she wouldn't stay away. she was sitting on the porch the very next day. the cat came back, she didn't want to roam. the very next day it was home, sweet home. a cannon is rolled into view. so bennie bought a gun from the human cannonball. he put the cat inside with trinitro toluol. when he pulled the trigger, the cannon made a roar. the neighbors all surrendered 'cause they thought it was a war   we surrender. we surrender.  but the cat came back, she wouldn't stay away. she was sitting on the porch the very next day. the cat came back, she didn't want to roam. the very next day it was home, sweet home. last verse, here we go. a dog gives gaffer a bomb with a lit fuse. little bennie gave the cat to a man who had a bomb. when he took the cat away, she was acting cool and calm. and then the bomb exploded, it made an awful sound they looked and looked for ages and the man was never found. buuuuut the cat came back, she wouldn't stay away. she was sitting on the porch the very next day. sing. the cat came back, she didn't want to roam. the very next day it was home, sweet home. very nice. applause. woof woof. meow. they chuckle. rowlf leads gaffer and the dogs backstage. well, i see the cat came

to leave. i'll look for him for you. uh, but don't touch that trunk. it's full of fungus.  yuchh. thanks for the warning. kermit.  let me outta here. she opens the trunk and he gasps for air. she holds her nose. eww. you're not fungus.  i'm sorry about the smell. you're kermit the frog. oh  oh, linda. i'm so glad you're doing the show. oh, i'm so pleased to be here. oh, good. you know, i, i

whatnots sing "i'm so happy" while overrun with cobwebs. linda makes herself up in the mirror. someone knocks on the door. is that you, kermit.  no, it's just me. hi, linder. hi, janice. you wanna go over the song. yeah, i guess so. great. two backup singers get behind linda. you haven't seen kermit, have you. no. well  he was here, but  now i can't seem to find him again. oh, bummer. well  at least i got his picture. linda, janice and the backup singers launch into a rendition of "it's in his kiss". well, we still don't have kermit the frog, but we do have lola the fan dancer. the curtain opens on lola, who dances with two electric fans as burlesque music plays. the fans briefly lift her up to the ceiling, and she falls.  pigs in space on next. scooter, have you seen kermit. hmm. i'm still looking for him. aren't we all. i thought he liked me. the steamer trunk rattles, knocking over a flower vase. kermit. are you still in there. kermit.  piggy did this. she locked me in. you've

and he gasps for air. oh. i wouldn't take your frog from you. c'mon, kermit. what. on stage, rowlf plays a fanfare on the piano as linda emerges to applause. um, okay, yeah, we'll talk about that later, miss piggy. oh, kermit. thanks for singing this song for me. even though i know your heart still belongs to piggy. well, you may know that, aand piggy may know that, but  the vote's not in yet from the frog. well  it's been nice being with you. even if it's only been for a little while. they sing a duet of "when i grow too old to dream", later joined by the other muppets. piggy watches from the wings, and rizzo sobs. okay. well, we've just about come to the end of another one, and i'm sorry i didn't get to see more of it because our guest star has been the very talented, the very beautiful, miss linda ronstadt. yaaaayy. applause. and it's been fun singing with the very cute, and the very green, kermit the frog. aww. thank you. aand by the way, thank you, could i have a good night kiss.  do you think we should. i mean  miss piggy  oh. well, don't worry about miss piggy, because i've taken care of her. she will cause us no problem. piggy, locked in the steamer trunk, hobbles onstage.  uh, just try to ignore that, linda. now how about that kiss. maybe we'd better just shake hands and say goodnight.  you got it, kid. we'll see you next time on the muppet show. piggy knocks him over from within the trunk. the muppets gather around linda as the credits roll. i wouldn't believe it if i hadn't watched it. believe what. i don't know. i wasn't watching. they chuckle. )
