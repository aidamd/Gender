army to throw you off this stage, pig. no i don't.  oh yeah. oh yeah. oh yeah. oh yeah. hold it, hold it, hold it, everybody, hold it. what. oh, now, kermit, you know how important miss piggy is to the show. well  and miss piggy, miss piggy, you know you wouldn't be happy anywhere else.  well   oh, so, come on now, let's, let's sing a nice, warm  lovely together song. huh. i hate sappy songs like that. all right then, why don't you two just kiss and make up.  well, let's sing the sappy song.  you don't make it easy, frog. isn't it warm. isn't it cozy. side by side   by side. ports in a storm, comfy and cozy, side by side  the tension between kermit and piggy slowly melts as they sing.  by side. everything shines. how sweet. side by side by side. parallel lines, who meet. side by side by side. everyone winks. nobody's nosy. side by side by side. you bring the drinks, and i'll bring the posy, side by side by side. one's impossible. two is dreary. three is company, bright and cheery. side by side by side.  welcome back, miss piggy. thank you. oh, we've missed you so. tell her how much we missed her, go on, kermit, go ahead, please. tell me. well  what would we do without you. huh. oh .... the cast comes in. what would we do without you. how would we ever get through. who would i complain to for hours. who'd bring me the flowers when i had the flu. who changes subjects on cue. who cheers us up when we're blue. who is so dear, and who is so deep. and who would keep us occupied when we want to sleep. how would we ever get through. what would we do without you. okay, everybody, one more time, just for miss piggy, huh. here we go. year after year, older and older, side by side, by side. sharing a tear, and lending a shoulder, side by side, by side. one is lonely  and two is boring. think what you can keep ignoring. side by side, by side, by side, by side, by side, by side, by side, by  side. applause. piggy kisses kermit, and he scowls. main stage. kermit enters to applause. okay, well, that's all the time we have, but before we go, let us say thank you to a wonderful guest star that we always have time for. she's beautiful, she's funny and she remains calm when everybody around her is going "aaagh." ladies and gentlemen, miss loretta swit. yaaaay. applause. thank you. thank you, kermit. aww. you know, i hope nobody out there believes that i was really trying to take over for miss piggy. oh, oh, no, no, no. well, because, you know, when a great actress and a great star has developed a role, it's impossible for another actress to fill her shoes. piggy walks on stage, dressed as houlihan from m*a*s*h. she laughs lightly at loretta, then looks down. funny. the shoes don't fit.  uh, we'll see you next time on the muppet show. the muppets gather around loretta as the credits roll. south dakota. south dakota has nothing to do with this show. that's what i want  nothing to do with this show. they chuckle. ) )
