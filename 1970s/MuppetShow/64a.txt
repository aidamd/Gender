want no bright lights, false teeth, doorbells, landlords, we'll make it clear, that no matter how they coax us, we'll stay right here. three pig photographers approach dyan and start taking her picture. they hurry like savages to get aboard a subway train. and though it's smokey and it's crowded, they are too civilized to complain. at the movies they have got to pay many coconuts to see quongo throws a coconut. she catches it and poses for the pigs. uncivilized pictures that the camera takes of me. she bonks them with the coconut. the animals cheer. so bongo, bongo, bongo, we don't want to leave the congo, oh no no no no no. oh, bingo, bangle, bungle, we're so happy in the jungle, we refuse to go. don't want no penthouse, bathtub, discos, taxis, noise in our ear. so, no matter

heh heh heh. yes indeed. he picks up foofoo, puts her in a drawer, shuts it and traps her inside. breathe through the keyhole, turkeydog.  piggy walks up to the operating table, and notices the patient's fuzzy slippers. and now, veterinarian's hospital, the continuing stooory of a quack who's gone to the dogs. tickle tickle tickle. the patient, the singer from the atrics, giggles, and so do rowlf and janice. you know, this patient looks like my last patient. i know she does, but it isn't. this one's still breathing. they all laugh. uh oh. does that mean i still have a chance. well, you did till you came in here.   dr. bob, this is an elderly patient. i hope you don't do any jokes about her age. if i can't do old jokes, you're takin' away my best shots.  your only shots.  ooooh.

"pull her through". dyan finishes a cup of tea. kermit knocks on the door. mmhm, come in. hi, dyan, is everything okay. mm. hi, kermit. sure, everything's fine. uh, is the wig alright. listen, i was going to ask you about that. i'm not wearing a wig on this show. oh, no, it's not to wear. he walks over to a cage with a wig inside. it's a, umm, it's a pet wig. the wig snarls and bites the cage. uh, it belongs to smiling jim sepulveda and his tapdancing toupees. i've never seen a pet wig before. what do you feed them. oh, anything, um, table scraps, mostly. really. table scraps. mmhm. she clears the table and breaks off a piece of it to feed to the wig. you mean, um  like this. the wig scarfs down the table piece. dyan laughs. rowlf plays the piano. and now, here's a lovely song that's about an old dog friend of mine, who's no longer with us. his name was  well, his name was tray. and it goes like this. what gentler eye  what nobler  heart  does warm the winter day  than the true, blue orb  and the oaken core  of beloved old dog tray. dogs gather around the piano with hankies as he sings, and they all start to howl and cry. modulate. what gentler eye  what nobler  heart  does warm the winter's day  than the true, blue orb  >sniff< and the oaken core  of beloved old dog >sniff< tray. all the dogs, including rowlf, are bawling out loud by the end. open on the chef, with a boiling pot on the stove. he waves a pan and spatula.   brk brk brk. he tosses them aside.   de htt dgg.  de dgg      de htt ptt.  woo woo woo.   de dgg int de ptt. he opens the pot and empties the bowl of frankfurters. psst. psst. psst. the chef wonders where the voice is coming from.  hell. psst. psst. it's piggy, crawling on the floor. psst. psst. chef. oh.    de pg. have you seen foofoo.

princess.   oh boy. if i were floyd, i wouldn't do that, because maybe miss piggy has realized that he's the one that stuffed foofoo into the drawer. floyd comes flying out of the dressing room, landing on the drums. uh, strike the maybe. floyd gets up, looking dizzy. main stage. kermit enters. uh, well, folks, i suppose you've noticed that there have been a lot of canines on tonight's show. in fact, i suppose you could say that the whole show has gone to the dogs. a toughlooking terrier towers over kermit. uh, you could say that, but i certainly wouldn't. why not say it. some folks think going to the dogs is a very good thing. indeed, indeed. uh, my feelings exactly. uh, thank you, sir. the dog walks away. well, uh, and that's why we've sent our guest star down to the pet shop, and here she is, ladies and gentlemen, miss dyan cannon. yaaaayyy. open on a pet shop full of dogs. dyan looks in the window, then enters. the minute i walked in the joint  woof woof. we could see you

time.  let us show you a  good time. they all bark and howl as she pets them. yes, you too.  you're so handsome here, aren't you. aren't you handsome. an orchestral vamp plays as she kneels down and notices a homely spaniel. wouldn't you like to be mine. yours. mine. we could have a good time. fine. time. i could get you a  a big bone. would you take me to    your home. oh, yes. she carries him out of the shop. the minute you walked in the shop  i could see you were a dog of distinction. a real class spaniel. good lookin', so refined. i'm sure you know by now what's goin' on in my mind. so
