doesn't trust him, but he loves me, i can tell. yeah. and each day the greyhound arrives at nine o' clock. but i don't start my crying 'till that last man's gotten off. oh, uh, excuse me  last time i  hi, kermit  what's the matter. you look funny. uh, uh, well, it's just the audience out there. uh, you see, nothing is working except, uh, well, things like you. oh  things like me. well  what do you  well  do you think we can go out there and sing this song. we're doing this messing around  rehearsing a little bit. that would be wonderful. just one second. okay  let's go. come on, guys. yeah. yeah.  kermit rushes onstage. and now, ladies and gentlemen, miss diana ross. yaaaay. the electric mayhem backs up diana as she continues the song. she is joined by three backup singers and a dixieland group. balloons fall from the ceiling. the applause is monstrous. okay. wow. that's another 10 for diana ross. okay, now who'd like to go out there and follow that. everyone upstairs ducks. fozzie runs away. gee, there must be somebody stupid enough to go out there and face that audience. whoosh. gonzo appears. hahahaha. i'll do it, kermit. i've got the ultimate act. but, i'm going to need a typewriter for it.  gonzo, we don't have a typewriter. then i'll use a cow. well  what is this act of yours. i can sum it up in one word: "indescribable". okay, why not.  main stage. kermit enters to a fanfare. uh, and now, ladies and gentlemen, i'm sure you're going to love gonzo the great.. yaaaaay. the curtain opens on gonzo and his indescribable setup. the audience boos and throws vegetables at him, knocking him off his perch. ladies and ge  ah. the curtain closes. statler and waldorf hold up a "6" card. gonzo is carried backstage on a stretcher by nurse janice and dr. bob. gonzo. are you okay. oh, sure. just a couple of tomato burns and cabbage cuts.  it's getting worse out there. i'd better get diana back onstage and restore order.  main stage. kermit enters. uh, okay, folks, uh, you win. here  uh, is she ready. uh, here she is, miss diana ross. yaaaaay. the audience applauds wildly for diana. thank you. thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. before i sing my next song, i would like to bring a friend of mine back on the stage. and i really do think he deserves another chance. kermit, scooter and fozzie watch from the wings. who's she talking about. i don't know. here he is, that furry, funny man, fozzie bear. the audience boos. oh, no  no, i can't   go on, fozzie. get out there. he hides behind her. hi. fozzie  oh, guys, come on. they  they just don't think i'm funny. oh, i think you're very funny. come on. but  they don't like me. well, i think you're very funny. look, tell them the joke  tell them the joke that you told me in the dressing room right before we came out. hm. okay. that's a terrible joke. it's the best joke i've ever heard. are you kidding. i can't do that joke. oh, come on, it's a good one. give it a try. come on. please. okay, stick close. okay. um  hahahaha. hiya hiya hiya. hey. have you heard about the new soft drink they're making, juh i can't do this joke. aww, come on. diana  it's a rough crowd. okay, i'll do it. you trust me. hiya hiya hiya. have you heard about the new soft drink they're making just for frogs. uh, no. tell me about the new soft drink they're making just for frogs. it's called  "croakacola."  the audience applauds. fozzie is puzzled. isn't that the best.  i'm a hit. how  how did you do that. oh, fozzie, see, it's very simple. you see, i think that uh, telling comedy, you know, doing comedy jokes and things like that is just like singing. really. music swells up. all you have to do is let the audience know that you're reaching out to them and, in return, they reach right back to you. just like this wow. she sings "reach out and touch", soon joined by the other muppets, as well as the audience, including statler and waldorf. the other muppets hum "reach out and touch" while kermit addresses the crowd. well, it's been a very special show, and uh, you've been a very special audience. uh, but before we go, let us say thank you to a wonderful guest star, ladies and gentlemen, miss diana ross. yaaaaay. applause. thank you. kermit, i really loved being here. thank you very much. and i just loved your croakacola joke. oh, good. yeah  of course, i got a better one. yeah. okay. great. okay, here we go. have you heard about the new soft drink made out of acorns. no. tell me about the new soft drink made out of acorns. it's called "oakacola". the audience boos. aw. come on. fozzie. i can't protect you from that one. uh  we'll see you next time on the muppet show. bye. the credits roll. after the credits, statler and waldorf are no longer keeping score. instead, they're keeping "snore." ) )
