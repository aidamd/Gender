he presses some buttons, and m.a.m.m.a. plays a robotic version of the muppet show theme. kermit dances. dudley demonstrates the machine to kermit as the music changes. by fiddling with these thingamajigs here, i can get, uh, classical, or  jazz. ah. or disco. m.a.m.m.a. plays robotic disco music. gee. hey, could we use it for our next number. sure. what is it. it's called "at the dance".

you fans of the roaring twenties, we have one of the top hits of 1929, written by charles "cowcow" davenport, called "mama don't 'llow." oh, good. cowcow's songs are so moooooving. uh  yeah. uh, okay, and it's played for you with his music and mood management apparatus, the fabulously talented mr. dudley moore. yaaaay. the curtain opens on dudley and the electric mayhem, with m.a.m.m.a. in the front. okay, guys, take five. the mayhem starts playing dave brubeck's "take five". dudley stops them. hold it. hold it. what's wrong. no, i meant, uh, lay out. i won't be needing you. wha. how come.

the machine. would you believe this. it's a musical garbage can. playing musical garbage.  yeah. it ain't got that swing when it's played by a thing. still, you will note, that it is being played, and nobody bein' paid.  hmm, true. true. jive. the mayhem all walk away. m.a.m.m.a. don't allow no drummin' man in here. m.a.m.m.a. don't allow no drummin' man in here. animal passes by. m.a.m.m.a. said she gonna light a boom if she hear drumming in this room. 'cause m.a.m.m.a. don't allow no drummin', in here. animal walks up to m.a.m.m.a. as it plays a digital drum solo. he starts gnawing on the machine, finds it impenetrable, and walks away. dudley plays a jazzy piano solo and concludes the song. applause. the mayhem approaches kermit. rowlf joins them. we gotta talk to him.  hey, cricketbreath.  oh, uh, hi, guys. yeah, what's this electric noman's band you're using.  oh  that's just an experiment, that's all, floyd. listen, turtlebait. just because it can play for dudley moore don't mean it can play the rest of the show. m.a.m.m.a. is wheeled

first notes of beethoven's 5th symphony. open on link and piggy fiddling with the controls. m.a.m.m.a. appears in the window. when last we left the spaceship swinetrek, it was being followed by a mysterious object. it looks like one of those things that scientists send up from earth. what do you call them. satellite. of course it's a light. looks like a lot of lights, but what do you call it. mon capitan is off to a great start. hmm.  link, i've just found out what that object is. what is it, dr. strangepork. i'll tell you when i make my entrance. huh. the doors open. dr. strangepork makes a grand entrance to a fanfare played by m.a.m.m.a.. that machine was sent up here to underscore this sketch. huh. ja. that music was for my entrance.  pretty big fanfare for a mere passengerhyphenscientist. imagine what it would be for a captain. think i'll try it, hmm.  here i go. he exits, then comes back in. your captain is here. m.a.m.m.a. plays "wahwahwahwahhhhh." what the hey.  look, look, strangepork  you mean, we're stuck with that all through the sketch. m.a.m.m.a. plays a dramatic sting. i'm afraid so. m.a.m.m.a. plays another dramatic sting. isn't there anything we can do. m.a.m.m.a. plays another dramatic sting. nothing. m.a.m.m.a. plays another dramatic sting. get ready  this is a catastrophe. m.a.m.m.a. plays "wahwahwahwahhhhh." how come it always plays dumb music when i talk. i can't take anymore of this. i'm walking. you can't. ha. watch me. as she walks, m.a.m.m.a. plays a slow jazzy score. link and strangepork start catcalling her. woo woo. hubba hubba.  woo woo. what do you think you're doing. just what you told us to. yeah, you said "watch me". they laugh. m.a.m.m.a. plays "wahwahwahwahhhhh." m.a.m.m.a. plays comical chase music as she chases them around the ship. piggy hears a knock on her dressing room door. oh. entreztoi. uh, did you want to see me, miss piggy. oh, yes, kermie, come in. romantic music swells up. oh, kermie  yes,

but piggy  don't be silly. there's nothing outside that door to worry about. yes there is. there's something out there. there's something  evil. and monstrous. i can feel it, lurking and waiting to pounce. oh. oh. piggy. that's just the door to the corridor. no. now get out of my way, piggy. no. no. i won't. i won't let you. piggy. get back from the door. piggy. listen. piggy. you're going to

and my friend come in.  yyeah. sure. oh, good.  if this is your friend, i'd hate to meet your enemies.  yeah, well, listen. as members of the band  band.   yeah, we've come here to have it out with you about this music machine that you've got.  yeah. right. uh, i, i, i know we have differing opinions on the subject, so it's probably best to talk about it. yeah, i'm glad you feel that way. yeah, well, uh  why don't we openly and freely, uh, express our feelings on the subject. good. yeah yeah. i feel that that cheap jive jukebox is gonna put an end to the gig for the band, man. i mean, we haven't worked all night, and it's your fault. your fault, dudley.  dudley. well  yeah, comes payback a time old man frog gonna wonder why he's payin' legal tender on us. on us. dudley. well  wellstated. um  i think it's a very  succinct and valid  uh  uh, expression of your opinion. i on the other hand, feel that uh, technological advances should not be  viewed, uh, as an enemy. animal walks up to him, breathing in his face. i mean, after all  great triumphs of  science  um  uh, are also, uh, true advances of the human spirit. and i don't feel that we  we should    let, uh, let temporary or personal considerations stand in, in the way. how  how do you feel about that, animal. kill.. kill. kill.  all right. all right. anything you like. anything you say. please. anything. anything. hey. sit. sit. heel. heel.  well, i  i didn't realize he was president of your debating society. animal resumes attacking him. main stage. kermit enters. okay, now i have a real treat for all you fear and culture lovers. ahem. uh, it's time once again for gonzo the great. uh, gonzo apparently has a real crazy act tonight. he won't even tell me what it is, but i do have this message: we have to ask for complete and total silence from everyone. fozzie shushes m.a.m.m.a., which plays a drumroll. and now, gonzo the great. the curtain opens on gonzo, next to a megaton bomb. thank you, thank you. i must have complete silence for this act, please. ahem. thank you. i shall now recite from the works of percy bysshe shelley while  and at the same time  diffusing this high explosive bomb.  he gets started diffusing. hail to thee, blithe spirit. bird th he hears ticking. bird thou never wert. m.a.m.m.a. approaches behind him. that from heaven or near it pourest thy full heart in profuse strains of unpremeditated art. m.a.m.m.a. plays a loud dramatic sting, throwing him off. the bomb explodes, sending gonzo flying backstage. he gets up. what a finish. he laughs and runs away. m.a.m.m.a. rolls backstage, burned to a crisp and smoking. ah ha, look at this.   uh, hey guys. uh, uh, guys. uh, listen, would you all do me a big favor and uh  and finish the show. oh. why. is anything wrong, little swamp brother. the mayhem members laugh. uh, uh, yeah, well, uh, see, dudley's music machine seems to be on the uh, ahem, sick list, and uh,  "seems to be "  well  maybe it'll still work. he turns it on, and it plays  japanese kabuki music. uh, listen, guys, if you all will finish up the show, i promise i will never even think of using another band. uh, let us deliberate. the mayhem huddle up and mumble. no. no. no, no, no. pretty please with cream and sugar on top. okay. you got it. okay. oh, good, good. thank you so much.  ha ha. let's show him what a band sounds like. okay. okay. he stops, looks at m.a.m.m.a., and gives it a swift kick, knocking off the top unit. okay. okay. and now, ladies and gentlemen, appearing next is our own wonderful muppet band  with mr. dudley moore. yaaaay. dudley and the electric mayhem perform "how high the moon", wearing hardhats as the theater falls apart around them. some rats dance nearby. animal's wild drumming loosens more rubble. okay. well, ladies and gentlemen, it has been a splendid evening, marred only by the fact that we blew up half the theater. but before we go, let us have one last round of applause for our very special guest star, ladies and gentlemen, mr. dudley moore. yaaaay. applause. thank you very much, kermit. it's been a real pleasure playing the remains of the muppet theater. uh  yeah, and i'm sorry to say that we broke your machine. oh  no trouble. i'm happy to say i fixed it again. oh.  uh, i'm sorry to say i liked it better when it was broken. the newly fixed m.a.m.m.a. wheels out. oh. uh, i'll just program it for the, uh, closing theme.  uh, well, there's nothing left for me to say but, we'll see you next time on the muppet show. the muppets gather around m.a.m.m.a. as it plays a medley of previously heard music, including the theme. the credits roll. so they blew up half the theater. at least they blew up the right half. theirs.  animal begins hitting m.a.m.m.a. as it plays the final note. ) )
