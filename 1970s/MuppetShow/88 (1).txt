never ask. it goes like this. he plays the opening riff. remember. yeah. they sing "the rainbow connection". the frog scouts join them towards the end. a rainbow appears above them. link and strangepork try to steer the ship as it rattles. oh. captain link. whatever shall we do. don't worry, first mate piggy, no meteor can penetrate the hull of this ship. it's made of superstrength porkium alloy. ja, that's right. absolutely no chance of any damage. a hole is immediately punctured in the hull, and the ship starts losing air. piggy screams. of course, i'm usually wrong about these things. help. there's a hole in the hull. there's a hole in the hull. help.  we've got to plug the hole before all the air is sucked out of the ship. yes, but what can we plug it with. i don't know, knucklebrain. you just plug the hole. okay. he drags piggy towards the hole and plugs it with her head. hey  what's going on. there. there, now we've plugged the hole. are you happy.  no i'm not. get me outta here. lucky it was a snoutsized hole, or we'd be in big trouble.  if you don't get me out of here, you'll be in even bigger trouble. quick, link. get the pepper. get the pepper. yeah, don't worry. with this pepper, we'll have you out of there in no time. link fetches a pepper shaker and sprinkles it on piggy. hold it  hold it  sprinkle sprinkle sprinkle. she sneezes her way out of the hole. oh. oh, help. i'm being sucked into the hole. he plugs it. oh, good work, captain. you've saved the ship. yay. tune in again next time for pigs in space, when we'll hear captain link say  oh  but what about my head. don't worry, it's not a vital organ. the closing music plays. okay. pigs in space, very exciting. that was a mess, kermie. well, ii'm sorry about that, piggy. the frog scouts get in her way.  would you get a job.  oh, that poor thing. what happened to him. uh, well, it's a long story. actually, it's a short story  he did something dumb. well, we can't let him suffer like that. scouts. give that pig first aid. they all gang up on link and cover him in bandages. am i better. gee, they're very fast. oh, yes, yes, and with great precision, too. why, you should have them do their closeorder drill on the show. well, they're amateurs, and we only book professionals. oh. whoosh. enter gonzo. kermit, it's disaster time. you're gonna have to cancel my wrestling match with quongo, the wild mountain gorilla. but why. he just called from his limo. it's stuck in traffic. sorry.  that was a professional. yyeah. uh, listen, maybe we can overlook our rule against amateurs tonight. how soon can your scouts be ready. tenhut. they stand at attention. you're next.  scouts  are you ready for the big time. yes, miss appleby. swell. but first we gotta do this crummy show.  main stage. kermit enters to a fanfare. uh, ladies and gentlemen, i'm sorry to announce that, due to circumstances beyond our control, the great gonzo will be unable to wrestle a fierce mountain gorilla as advertised. audience: "awwww." but, it is an ill wind that has no silver lining, so in his place, we proudly present the precision drill team from the okefenokee pack 12 of the frog scouts of america. yaaayy. the frog scouts do their march as their drill sergeant calls. hut. hut. hut. hut. sound off. sound off. one two. one two. one two three four. one two. three four. go

honorary frog scout. the frog scouts come out and cheer. by the way, kermit, i think it was very nice of you to let the frog scouts perform on the show. uh  mr. frog, my boys just did your show, and we never negotiated a deal.  but you can't do that to me. hm. oh, yes she can, kermit. she's got her merit badge in deal negotiation. uh  we'll see you next time on the muppet show. the chatter continues as the credits roll. can we stay here while we work on our next merit badge. merit badge in what. grumpiness. the frog scouts laugh while statler and waldorf scowl. )
