 the day of the archery contest. there isn't one seat left to sell. the crowd on the green's packed as tight as sardines, which might also account for the smell. the fanfare resumes. some of the crowd boos.  both contestants look good to the experts. yes, the winner is tricky to choose. but i'll stick my neck out and, without any doubt, say the other guy's certain to lose. is that it. is that all you can tell us. well... as our archers warm up on the track. but, regrettably, he only gets to say... gee. when a practice shot cancels his act. thwack. an arrow hits louis in the face. he faints. black bart is the opening archer, the sheriff of nottingham's man. with the strength of an ox, the nerve of a fox and the brains of a gooseberry flan. black bart shoots, hitting the outside of the target. the crowd cheers. beauregard takes the arrow and sets it in the center. but the sheriff has bribed and corrupted a youth the rules of the contest to bend. he never heard say that crime doesn't pay black bart shoots another arrow, which lands in beau's rump. but he sure gets the point in the end. the crowd cheers. a disguised kermit steps up. so with black bart awarded a bull'seye, there's little poor robin can do. save to trust to his luck, his nerve and his pluck  sproing.  and split black bart's arrow in two. the crowd rejoices except for black bart. applause. thank you, thank you,
