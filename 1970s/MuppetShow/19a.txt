 oh, relax, kermit. relax. and you can call me ethel. huh. but i'd like you to take it easy on that "legend" and "the greatest" stuff. sounds like a eulogy. after all, i'm  i'm not quite ready to go yet. no, no, no, no, no. i  i didn't mean it like that. well, ii mean, i admit that i've been around for quite a while, but  there are some things on this show that are older than i. like uh, fozzie's

gypsy. sure. a beat. come to think of it, i did hear some croaking in the audience. kermit laughs. piggy enters with a champagne glass. ahhem. excuse me, miss merman. i do not wish to intrude, but i too am a singer of note. what note. who knows. it's always flat.  watch it, flipper face. as a sister singer, i gratefully admire your talent, and so i would like to propose a toast in your honor. oh, how nice of you, miss piggy. mmhm. to ethel merman, a great woman and a great singer, whom we can all learn something from. got any tips. all that for one free singing lesson.  well  now, look, miss piggy. let's face it. you either got it, or you ain't. mmhm. and all the singing lessons in the world ain't gonna help you if you ain't got it. now, let's hear you hit that high note of yours again. ahem.  well, it shows promise. see, kermit. but it it's a bit subtle. now, this is the way i would do it  she hits a high note. kermit is knocked off, and piggy's glass shatters. did you also make some recordings as an airraid siren during the war.  kermit.  ah, she and kermit make a nice pair. well, she certainly is a peach. they chuckle. main stage. kermit enters. uh, we on the muppet show are very interested in puppets, for some strange reason. anyway, tonight we're really delighted to have with us a man who produces the world's funniest shadows. here he is from australia our guest puppeteer, mr. richard bradshaw. richard performs shadow puppetry. in the first act, an ostrich slides down a slide, then a mouse. when a hippo climbs up the ladder, he breaks the slide. more. more. hey, wait. look, there is more. oh, good grief. they heard me. in the second act, the three animals balance on a tightrope. hey, come on, kermit. the kid's worth twice the price. yeah, well, i don't

time to present a comic who, even as i speak, is in danger of negotiating himself right out of work. ladies and gentlemen, the funniest bear since maxie, mr. fozzie bear. the curtain opens on fozzie as his fanfare plays. oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy. yes, yes, yes. oh, i get a feeling you're a great bunch, not like the audience we had last week. hah. they weren't an audience, they were a jury. ha ha. angle on the audience: a fozzie lookalike sits in the back.  haaaah. the bear's funny, huh. yeah, he's  he's my cousin.  wanna leave a wakeup call. uh, if you don't mind, cousin, i will do the jokes. let him roll. he's funnier than you.  hey, will you guys hold it down up there. uh, you don't want them interrupting my act, right. no, i don't want 'em interrupting our sleep.  hey, bring on the comic. i am the comic. then bring on the girls. this is not that kind of show. then bring on the girl comic. the audience laughs. now, listen. i am not gonna be heckled by some clown who just came off the street. ii'm a pro, buddy. a real pro. look, okay. i tell you what. everybody, i am gonna turn my back, and when i turn around again, i only wanna see real fozzie bear fans in the audience. okay. here we go. when he turns his back, the audience walks out. okay, i'm gonna turn around now. he sees that they've all left. even my cousin.  ohh. it's a cruel world.  hey, hey. how come you two guys are still there, huh. did you lose your beds at the old fools' home. statler and waldorf chuckle. ah, it's too late. he walks off. the curtain closes as the fanfare plays. fozzie encounters kermit and irving negotiating. all right, kermit, my client won't work unless you give him twice as much money. uh, yeah. i just saw how he handled that audience. but to show you what a good guy i am, i'll give him three times as much. we won't settle for less than four times as much. uh, how about a compromise. five times as much money. six times as much. uh, don't push it, irv. uh, seven times as much. eight times. this is my final offer. ten times as much as he's making now. you got a deal. good.  oh, irv. irv. heyhey. congratulations, kid. you're making ten times as much money. yeah, yeah, and i and i used to make nothing. right. and  and ten times nothing is er, ummm  nothing. yeah, right. and don't forget, i get ten percent of that. you're worth every penny, irv.  uh, could you give me a hand down, kid. fozzie sets him down. hey, fozzie.  yeah. listen, fozzie. don't be discouraged. even if you don't make a lot of money, you're doing what you love to do. just look around you. she launches into a rendition of "there's no business like show business". the other muppets join her backstage, then onstage. well, another halfhour has flown by, made most enjoyable by our very special guest star, miss ethel merman. applause as she comes out. oh, thank you, kermit. this has been the most fun i've had in a long, long time. you know, you really don't have to be crazy to do this show. but it helps. kermit laughs. piggy shows up with some roses. miss merman, from all of us to you. oh, how kind of you, miss piggy. they won't explode, will they. no, no, of course not. real roses for a real lady. thank you for joining us, and you too out there, we'll see you all next time on the muppet show. the muppets gather around ethel as the credits roll.  i wonder why i'm so itchy. maybe the show's starting to get under your skin. they chuckle. ) )
