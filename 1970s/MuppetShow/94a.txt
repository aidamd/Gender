oh, i hope you didn't mind that. it's okay. i allow one per show. okay, come on in. but be careful. see, there's a fella up there fixing the roof.  hey. be careful up there, we've got an important guest here. who. she's gladys knight. yeah, so am i. it means i'm into overtime.  she shakes the ladder. hey, i was only funning, lady.  oof.  i said just one. it's the muppet show, with our very special guest star, gladys knight. yaaayyy. the curtain opens, and the theme begins. gonzo blows his trumpet triumphantly. i give autographs after the show. main stage. kermit enters to applause. thank you, thank you, hiho, and welcome again to the muppet show. behind him, a workman handles a rope. uh, you may notice some workmen around, and that's because we're having our leaky roof fixed. uh, but they won't interfere with the show. the workman is pulled up by the rope. um  anyhow, it's going to be a wonderful show because our guest star is the dynamic gladys knight. yes. but first... a bucket of nails on a rope falls from the ceiling and hangs beside him. will you get this bucket of nails out of here  but first, this  a trio of whatnot archaeologists enter an egyptian tomb singing "night and day". inside, they are greeted by three sarcophagi, who join them in song. the caskets open to reveal three mummies, one of whom is gonzo wrapped in bandages, and whisper some of the tune, inhaling incense. look at them. i think they're glad to see us. when you've been stood up for 4000 years, you're glad to see anybody. the nine of them join to finish the song together. well, those mummies didn't exactly bring the house down. some rubble falls near them. no, the roofers are handling that. they chuckle. uh, are you the frog. uh, of course i'm the frog. uh, what's that piece of wood. oh, well it's not just any old piece of wood. this is the piece of wood that holds up the roof. it's rotten. uh, wait a second. if that's the piece that holds up the roof, what's holding up the roof. my foreman. he's holding the roof up. yes. or, rather, no. he falls from the roof. some rubble comes down with him. uh, listen, guys. i've got to go introduce gladys knight. uh, can you get this fixed. not me, there's something about heights i don't like. uh, what's that. falling from them.  kermit rushes onstage. okay, well folks, it's time now to meet our very special guest. so, here she is putting the show on the right track and choochoo'ing into your station, let's say "all aboard" as we stop, look, and listen to miss gladys knight, yaaay. gladys sings "friendship train" on a carboard cutout of a train with three whatnot engineers, fozzie, slim wilson, some pigs, penguins, the swedish chef, a cow, a raccoon, gonzo and some other whatnots. great number. i love trains. yeah, but planes are safer. they are. sure. i only rode on a train once and it had an accident. what happened. a plane fell on it. they chuckle. gladys and the other muppets pass by kermit. okay, guys. great number, gladys. hey, thanks kermit. hey, you know what. i just love those muppips. aha, "muppips". ha ha ha. hey, fozzie. huh. where'd you learn to drive a train like that. oh, oh, i studied. i had train training. ahahaha. gladys rolls her eyes and goes to her dressing room. another worker approaches kermit. listen, mac, uh, we've got to talk. you are the frog, right. uh, uh, uh, of course i'm the frog. who could i be, the prince of wales. listen, prince. you've got big problems with this roof of yours. oh, boy. can't you fix it. hey, i can fix it. but not here. well, what's that supposed to mean. well, we're going to have to take it in to the shop. what.. okay, guys. signal the crane now, lift her up. rubble falls as some loud rumbling is heard. okay, load her on the truck. fozzie, rizzo and scooter look up with bewilderment. see you when your roof's finished. well, when will that be. hey, i don't know. these things can take months, you know.  gladys emerges from the dressing room. excuse me, kermit. huh. um, have you noticed that the roof is missing.  yeah, i noticed that gladys. but, uh, you must admit that it's a beautiful sunset. yeah, but i just heard the weather forecast. rain. no. snow. kermit whimpers. open on piggy playing with a medical instrument, then rushing to the operating table. and now, veterinarian's hospital, the continuing stoooory of a quack who's gone to the dogs. ahem. dr. bob, how can you operate without a roof. it's better without a roof. cuts down on the overhead.  that's doctor talk.  but, suppose it rains. we'll head for the nearest tax shelter.  that's more doctor talk.  oh, nurse janice. yes, dr. bob. where have you been. taking angry calls from the medical association. oooh.  dr. bob, the sky is threatening. yeah, so is the audience. but that's never stopped us.   i don't know whether you should operate. well, let's ask the patient. he can tell us. he's a weather man. you mean he knows whether or not i should operate. they all laugh. a bolt of lightning almost strikes him.  i didn't think it was that bad.  don't know why there's no sun up in the sky i do. because it's night time.  pretty dumb weather man.  oh, no he's not. he's a singing weather man. he's just telling you it's stormy weather. i don't believe this. but, he's right. it is stormy weather. i just felt some raindrops.  ...keep falling on my head, they keep falling there's gonna be more than that falling on your head. where's that barometer. they all look up as the announcer speaks. and so we come to the end of another veterinarian's hospital. he must be on a cloud. tune in next week when you'll hear nurse piggy say... hail falls from the sky. dr. bob, it's getting worse. it's beginning to hail. hail.  ...the gang's all here. what the heck do we oh, shut up. a caveman, backed up by prehistoric pigs, sings "alley oop". animal chases around a bear and butch with a club, but at the end, he's pulled off stage by a brontosaurus. oh, that number goes back a long ways. well, it didn't go back far enough. i could still see it. gladys stands by the piano as rowlf plays. oh, that's a nice blues, rowlf. mmm. it's easy to have the blues when you don't have a roof over your head.  true enough. actually, this is a little number by my favorite blues singer, fat mama jefferson. fat mama jefferson  uh, i don't remember her. was she a black woman. no. a white woman. actually, she was spotted. i beg  come on, wait a minute. don't tell me she was a dog.  boy, could she sing the blues.  she was a basset hound. okay, i remember her now. didn't she write that classic, "i won't hang my head in shame 'cause i step on my ears when i do". that's fat mama, all right. but that doesn't sound like your kind of song. well, not exactly. i lean more toward uh, ma rainey, dinah washington  billie holiday. hey  billie holiday.  boy, she sang some great songs. oh, i like that. remember this one. i remember it, all right. she sings "god bless the child", and is joined on stage by fozzie, scooter, pops, lew zealand, annie sue, beauregard and janice. kermit notices a cloud of fog rolling in. oh no, fog. that's the last straw. hey, hey, scooter. would you take over for me for a minute. uh, i've got to go see if i can do something about that roof. okay, chief.  signor baffi on next. oh, boy. look at this. oh, scooter, scooter. do you think there's room for my monologue in the show. oh, afraid not, foz. uh, but you can be in the next number. yeah, signor baffi's assistant didn't show up. oh, terrific. you won't be sorry. what do i do. well, uh, can you go out and stand on stage and smile. can i. can a fly bird.  can a bird fly. trust me.  oh uh, signor baffi. uh, what. uh, you're on as soon as i introduce you. say uh, this fog isn't going to interfere with your knife throwing, is it. oh, no. i'm'a aim'a by the sound anyway. you just tell the target to keep'a yelling. yeah. this'a the stage. uh, no no. this way, signor baffi. oh, oh. thank you. and now, the act you've all been waiting for: the one and only signor baffi and his flashing knives of death. the curtain opens to a foggy stage. baffi and fozzie walk around aimlessly as lively circus music plays. oh, where's'a my target. hey, fozzie. are you there. oh, what. yes sir. what. he throws some knives in fozzie's direction, just missing him. whahuhhuh. there'sthere's somebody throwing knives at me. bravo. hey, where are you. his next knife lands in the balcony, inches away from statler and waldorf. they duck.  quiet.  scooter, you have to be crazy to send a knife thrower out in a fog like this. whap. another knife lands inches from kermit's head. kermit, help. fozzie, don't yell. whap. another knife lands inches from kermit's head. beauregard, close the curtain. what did you say, kermit. whap. another knife lands on the rope holding the curtain, bringing it down. hey. backstage, the fog is so thick you could cut it with one of baffi's knives. oh, good news, chief. yeah. i think i feel a breeze coming up. oh, we could use some good news around here. kermit, help. help, hide me. there's this madman throwing knives at me. uh, uh, well don't worry, fozzie. it's all over now. oh, no. here he comes.  hey, where's'a that'a bear. he's'a make'a swell target. no, i don't. what. he throws another knife. whap. it hits the staircase. fozzie runs away screaming. just then, the wind starts blowing all the papers away, as well as the fog. oh, boy. there goes the running order. now, how do i know which act is next. when in doubt, go with a star. uh, you're right. uh, go tell gladys she's on next, okay. they both go their separate ways. baffi is blown away by the wind. uh, uh, uh, well ladies and gentlemen, i think the wind is about to die down here. um, here she is with one of her greatest hits, a lady who can sing up a storm and may have to sing in one, miss gladys knight, yaay. for the closing number, gladys sings "i heard it through the grapevine" with some backup grape singers, and zoot on sax. by the end of the number, it's snowing so profusely, that a snow bank builds up on stage around gladys as she's singing. uh, well, it looks like everything's come down except the curtain. but before we go, let us bring back our wonderful guest star. ladies and gentlemen, gladys knight, yaaay. gladys reemerges, dressed in a mink coat. thanks kermit, it's been an evening i'll never forget. oh, well, that's too bad. i was hoping you would. uh, listen, i'm sorry about this roof business. oh, that's okay. i'm dressed for it. but what about you. aren't you cold. uh, no, i'm wearing my thermal collar. the grapes groan. uh, but they don't look too happy out there in the vineyard. oh, they're just sour grapes. we'll see you next time on the muppet show. the other muppets gather around as the credits roll. meanwhile, the snow has reached the balcony. statler and waldorf have their winter clothes on. we'll get pneumonia. big deal. this show always makes us sick. they chuckle. ) )
