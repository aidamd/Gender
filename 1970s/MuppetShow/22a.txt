contents the dressing room. scooter knocks on door. don knotts. don knotts. twentyfive seconds to curtain, mr. knotts. what are you doing hiding there behind the table. don is staring in fear at something behind a folding screen. listen, nobody told me i had to share a dressing room. didn't they tell you about her. her. gorgon heap pops up from behind the screen. what's the matter, sweetie. you don't like chorus girls. it's the muppet show, with our very special guest star, mr. don knotts. the curtain opens and the theme begins. statler and waldorf come in late. fire comes out of gonzo's trumpet. sorry. main stage. kermit enters. thank you. thank you. thank you, thank you, thank you and welcome again to the muppet show. hey listen, our guest star tonight is the slightly nervous, but very funny, mr. don knotts. but first, just for fun, here is a gingerflavored opening number. five gingerbread men dance to and sing "sweet gingerbread man." i know what's wrong with this show. what. it's the theater. what's wrong with it. the seats face the stage. they both chuckle. main stage. fozzie enters. thank you. hi. hiya, hiya. hey, hey, hey, listen. kermit is letting me help plan tonight's show. kermit enters. uh, that's true, folks. he plans his parts, and i plan the good parts. kermit. oh, i'm just kidding, fozzie. go ahead, make your introduction. oh, okay. moving right along, we take you now for a trip into...  ...inner space. open curtain. the screaming thing is sitting in a chair. i'm very relaxed. i'm terribly calm and tranquil. i'm very, very relaxed indeed. on the outside, but on the inside... the screaming thing sings "windmills of your mind" while running. he sings and runs increasingly faster until he crashes into a windmill. ...but on the outside i'm very calm. he screams and runs off screen. well, how'd you like that opening number. hmm. oh, i didn't notice it. didn't notice it. how is that possible. lt was loud and raucous with a screaming thing running amok. how could you not notice it. well, in the future i'll try to be more observant. the screaming thing runs in from behind them and jumps out of the balcony. neither of them notice it. would you do that, please. fozzie, holding a clipboard, and kermit are at kermit's desk. this is fun. i really want to thank you for letting me help plan tonight's show, kermit. yeah, well, i wish we planned something a little calmer for the opening spot. two pigs in scrubs carry the screaming thing offstage on a stretcher. he looks calm enough to me. floyd pepper approaches them. ok, green thing, the band has asked me to have a word with you. yeah. yeah. i refer specifically to the closing number. oh boy...  uh, well, i tell you,this is not my fault this time. see, fozzie bear helped me plan tonight's show, and he was the one that wanted the band to play lullaby of birdland. that was fozzie.   so this is the bear's doing, huh. you bet. oh, hi, floyd. uh, isn't lullaby of birdland all right. all right. hey, it's terrific. it is. it is. yeah. lullaby of birdland is a jazz classic. at last we got some decent music in this gig.  ha. kermit makes an annoyed face. yeah. lullaby of birdland. why isn't the bear running things around here.  yeah. why isn't the bear running things around here. yeah, why isn't the frog auditioning new comedians.   why isn't the bear keeping his mouth shut. main stage. kermit enters. ok, right now it's time for something good to happen, and that something is tonight's very funny guest star. welcome, please, the very relaxed mr. don knotts. the curtain opens to don knotts in a lab coat in front of many cubes with animals printed on them. he sits on a desk, along with a covered cage. thank you, boys and girls, and welcome to beast of the week, the program that presents the most hideous, repulsive, and disgusting animals in the world, just to amuse you sweet little kiddies. tonight's creature was just discovered,so it doesn't even have a name yet. shall we.  don removes the cover off the cage to reveal mean mama's baby. it growls softly and makes gibberish noises. oh, cute little fella, isn't it. uh, this is the first one ever born in captivity, and it's also the first time we've had it away from its mother. i don't know quite what to expect myself, so maybe we'll just learn together, huh. the creature takes a deep breath and squeezes through the bars of its cage. well, one thing we've just learned: it can get out of a cage, which i was told was absolutely escapeproof. don throws the cage off screen. mean mama's baby skitters away from him, hiding behind a globe. uh, i better get him... oh, look at that. he's found something shaped like himself. i believe he thinks they're related. lsn't that cute, boys and girls. he's trying to make friends. the creature growls angrily and knocks the globe off the table. not, uh... not trying to make friends. he's... i'll just, uh, get the globe. as don bends over to pick up the globe, the creature leaps off the table on to him, and proceeds to bounce all over the floor. i could use some help here. the creature crawls up his leg and throughout his coat, growling and making angry gibberish noises. don fidgets and fights it. it continues attacking him, then suddenly stops. where'd it go. where'd.... the creature crawls up his shoulder and makes a taunting noise. this is where my years of training as a zookeeper pay off. you notice i don't make any sudden moves... he's getting less frightened of me. i guess it likes me. the creature begins licking him.  stop it. that tickles. ...it's blowing in my ear.  the creature begins to bite him. he grabs it. it struggles to escape as he talks. gotcha. well, boys and girls, uh, that about wraps up tonight's beast of the week. we've got to get this little fella back to its mother before she wakes up. you see, the mother is very possessive of its offspring, and if she should discover it's missing, she could get very upset.  what's that. mama... mother. how could that be. she's in the cage. it's escapeproof. mean mama pops up from behind the table, destroys the set, and leaves with her baby. don is flabbergasted. well, that don knotts is one great performer. he certainly is. when is he gonna be on. he was just on. oh. did i like him. yeah, you laughed like crazy. oh, good. he's got a great sense of humor, but a terrible memory. fozzie, my main bear. mmm. what it is. you know everybody in the band is so blown away by the fact that you suggested we do lullaby of birdland on the show. blown away. is that good. good. yes. fozzie, you're so hip you make us flip. ln fact, we just took a vote and made you a bona fide registered hip dude. you have won your shades.  my shades.  yeah. now these are the official charlie parker lives supercool sunglasses. oh, thank you. welcome to groovydom.  oh. will you please tell the band how honored i am. oh, boy, i can't wait to tell kermit. kermit. fozzie turns to run off the other side of the stage and runs face first into the wall. in the operating room, miss piggy preens herself in a head mirror before running to join the others at the table. the patient is the screaming thing. and now, veterinarian's hospital, the continuing story of a quack who's gone to the dogs. well, let's take a look at our next patient. what seems to be his problem. i think he has flat feet, dr. bob. looks more like a flat tire to me. i think it's a case of three left feet. all laugh. three feet, dr. bob. what do you make of that. oh, about a yard. rimshot noise. all laugh. but is it serious, dr. bob. let's face it, this bird has one foot in the grave. but he has three feet on the table. that's nothing, i left two feet in cincinnati. that's six feet, dr. bob. what do you make of that. oh, about a fathom.  i certainly can't fathom any of this. and so dr. bob has performed another amazing medical feat. tune in next week when we'll hear nurse piggy say... shall we call in a specialist, dr. bob. no, just call a tow truck. all laugh. dr. bob tickles the screaming thing's feet. that tickles. a britishaccented whatnot sings about his lifestyle. don stands by himself in the usual guest star spot. hmm. strange. fozzie told me to meet him here and we could chat for a while. crashing and fozzie stumbling are heard from off screen. sorry, lady. oh, boy. oh, boy, oh, boy. wearing his shades, fozzie fingers his way along the wall to get onstage. hi, fozzie. aaah. oh, hello, don. good to see you. he is facing away from don. don taps him on the shoulder. aaah. oh. oh, hi, don. didn't see you. oh, well, why don't you take off the sunglasses. i couldn't do that. the band gave me these because they think i am so hip. oh, i see. confidentially, uh, i always wanted to be hip. oh yeah. yeah. personally, l've never had that problem. yeah. you know how it is.  when you've got it, you've got it. i mean, when you're hip, you're hip. yeah. uh, don, if you're so hip, where are your shades. shades. you want shades, i'll show you shades.  whaddya say. huh. how's that. how about that, huh. yeah. good to see ya. that's my man. that's my bear. gimme five. whatever. all right. yeah. don tries to feel his way offstage. crashing is heard. don. don, don, don.  rowlf sings "what a wonderful world" to a puppy. two whatnots leave the stage. hey, sounded lovely. sounded wonderful. wish i knew how it looked... hey, fozzie, my main fuzzy. ah. oh, floyd. yeah. listen, you know one of the dudes in the band is so turned on by the fact that you suggested we do lullaby of birdland... yeah. ...he would like to shake your hand personally. hey, out of sight. okay. animal enters and tackles fozzie to the ground.  thank you. no, animal. you promised. hey, man. heel, heel. animal and floyd leave  i didn't know it hurt to be hip. the swedish chef sings his theme song while pretending to strum a ladle like a guitar. he throws it at the shelf full of kitchenware behind him. he gives a mockswedish spiel about "fishy chowder" and dumps a muppet fish and other ingredients into a bowl. he tries to grind pepper into the bowl, and the fish grabs the grinder out of his hand. he pokes at it with a rubber spatula and the fish steals that as well. the chef slaps at the fish and leans down into the bowl, as the fish bites his nose and pulls his face down into it. we hear the chef making eating noises. he takes his head out of the bowl and gives the "ok" sign to the camera. the fish pokes up its head again, and the chef slaps it back down into the bowl.  what's wrong with you. it's either this show or indigestion. i hope it's indigestion. why. it'll get better in a little while. oh. fozzie is inspecting his clipboard again. floyd enters. fozzie, my fuzzy. hey. hey, everything is everything. whatever. hey. mmhmm. i was just wonderin'.... yes. ...how you were enjoying your new title as official hip dude. oh, i love it. i love the title. just wish it came with a flashlight. both of them laugh. kermit enters. floyd, floyd, it's time to do lullaby of birdland. ooh, yeah. speaking of which, uh, since i'm playing vibes in this number, we're gonna need another player for the bass. floyd, how can i find a bass player now. you're on. hey, kermit, no problem. i have already found the perfect bass player. floyd, you just go out there and start cookin', baby. ah, yeah, my bear. i knew you were a gas.  yes. all right. and i will introduce this number for my hip brothers, green stuff. hey hey.  the, uh, bear has wigged out. fozzie slides onstage and faces the curtain. hey. all right. all you hip dudes and swinging sisters out... he realizes his mistake and turns around. hey. all right. all you hip dudes and swinging sisters out there. time for a great golden goodie from fozzie's wiggie wonder world. here is lullaby of birdland. the curtains open. don knotts is holding a bass in front of zoot with his saxophone, floyd with a vibraphone, animal with his drums, and dr. teeth with his keyboard. search no more, my man. you must be the bass player. how'd you guess. oh, a shot in the dark. okay.  i'm cool. listen, we're gonna lay down a little lullaby of birdland on this cornball show. can you dig it. can i dig it. i got the music right here, man.  sheet music. i haven't seen that stuff for years. look at that, the cat can follow the dots.  all right. now, lullaby of birdland. uno, dos, tres... they all begin to play "lullaby of birdland" for a few seconds, then stop when floyd starts shouting at don. wait a minute. hey, hey. hold it. what in the pluperfect past tense was that. the lullaby of birdland, man. oh, yeah. well, it sounds like the bird died. you better lose the bow, baby. i knew something was wrong.  all right, here we go, guys. eins, zwei, drei... they all start the song again, this time with don glumly plucking at the bass. faster, man. this ain't no wedding. don complies. faster, man, faster. don plays faster and faster. the band cheers him on. take it, man. all right. yeah. yeah. here we go. the bass explodes, and so does don's suit. i loved it. kermit is on the stage. well, that's it for another show. i'd like to thank the guy who helped me plan tonight's merriment, good ol fozzie bear. fozzie, still in his shades, is feeling his way across stage behind kermit. uh, hooha, hello. ha... hello. hello, hello. crashes and fozzie's yells are heard as he goes off the other end of the stage. you went too far, fozzie. anyhow, and, of course, our very special guest star, the wonderful mr. don knotts. don knotts comes onstage, also with his shades. thank you. thank you, kermit... wherever you are. floyd and fozzie both come onstage. hey, hey. me and the band just took another vote because of what happened in the birdland number. yeah. you have been officially and permanently deshaded. take off your peepholes. oh no...  oh, don't worry, fozzie. always remember...  ...square is
