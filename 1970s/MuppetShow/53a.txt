contents the dressing room. scooter knocks on the door and peers in. helen reddy. uh, thirty seconds to curtain, miss reddy.  okay, scooter. i'll be there. reddy or not. yeah... did you mean to make that joke. well, i meant to make that joke before someone else did. oh  you think we'd stoop that low. hey, three to get reddy.  lower. it's the muppet show with our very special guest star, miss helen reddy. yaaaay. the curtain opens, and the theme begins. hey. there's chickens in our seat. shoo. musical notes come out of gonzo's horn. main stage. kermit enters to applause. thank you, thank you, thank you, and welcome again to the muppet show. hey, we've got a terrific show tonight because our special guest is one of the world's greatest singing talents, helen reddy. but right now, we whisk you back through time and space to the palace of versailles, where marie antoinette bears a striking resemblance to our own miss piggy. miss piggy portrays marie antoinette, who leads her subjects in a performance of "stayin' alive," until a guillotine outside scares them off. well, i'll say this for them. what's that. they don't show favoritism. they offend everyone. they chuckle. the pigs pass by kermit. aw, come on. let us eat cake. let us eat cake. not only historically wrong, but hysterically wrong.  sacr bleu. uh  what does that mean. sacred blue.  mesh. what a mess this place is. hey beauregard, i've got a job for you. oh, good. just look at this mess. okay. that sounds easy enough.  beauregard, the floor needs sweeping. there's a broom around here someplace. oh, yes, there it is. well, well, step on it. okay. he steps on it, and it hits him in the face. hey, that's a neat trick. beauregard, use some elbow grease.  elbow grease. he stretches his elbow and notices it's rusty. why didn't i think of that. main stage. kermit enters to applause. and now, it's an honor to have one of the world's greatest recording stars, and here she is, swinging up a storm at an informal session in the muppets' private studio, ladies and gentlemen, helen reddy. open on a recording studio. floyd counts in helen. one, two. one, two, three... helen sings "blue" as the band backs her up. hey, roger, how's the balance. i think animal's a little too loud on the drums. oh, okay. hey, animal. animal. animal briefly intensifies his drumming. helen continues, joined by some backup singers. animal concludes with a drum solo. applause. you know, if i had a voice like helen reddy, i'd never be on the muppet show. right. if you had a voice like helen reddy, you'd be in a side show. they chuckle. ah, hey, very good, beauregard, it really looks great. you've swept it spotless and polished it, too. well, i couldn't find any elbow grease. i expect not. so i used axle grease. kermit slips down the stairs. gladys passes by and also slips.  brother. beauregard, what kind of an idiot are you. aw  i didn't know there was a choice. floyd, watch out. huh. whoa.  what a drag. kermit gets up, then slides over into beau's arms. uh, beauregard, uh, how do you manage to stay upright. well, i'm wearing these special shoes. you want to borrow them. i don't think i can get anyplace without 'em. good. okay.  i got to get my flippers into these slippers. these are nonslippers. yeah. okay, what is the secret of these miracle shoes. oh, there's no secret. i just nailed them to the floor. kermit teeters. helen puts on lipstick. animal knocks at the door. helen. hll. hll. come in.  come in. thank you. animal and the chef enter, chattering. they take their positions and sing "happy birthday to you". wait. wait  there's been some mistake. today is not my birthday. animal and the chef look at each other, and start singing "jingle bells" instead. main stage. beauregard gives a speech. and so my great uncle beauregard said to me, he said, "beauregard, you go into show business, and you'll clean up."  you know something. he was right. you're named beauregard after him. about forty years after. beauregard.  oh. i'm working. i'm working. that's what i was afraid of. stop that polishing. but i've only done a little bit.  get off. off, off, off, off. uh  and now, ladies and gentlemen, we are going to have a brilliant dance number by our own fozzie bear and friends. but, uh, excuse me one second. fozzie. yeah  yeah, what, what. uh, fozzie, be careful. there's a very slippery place on the stage out here. where is that. i don't know, it's right around here somewha.  thank you. kermit pulls himself up by the curtain. uh, curtain. the curtain drags him away as it opens. an instrumental of "tea for two" plays as fozzie and three whatnots dance their way onstage. ahaaa.  whoa.  uh, be careful, there's a wet spot right here on the stage. he continues dancing. the whatnot trio dances behind him. careful. it's right there, it's right there. terrific, guys. you look great.  whoa. the trio dances towards the front of the stage. fozzie tries to steer them clear. uh, guys, be careful, there's a place right here. watch out, there's a wet place. watch out, right there. he sees them dance flawlessly over the spot. what the....  whoa. he tries to form a line with them. he slips, and soon causes them to slip as well. go to the front, i'll go back here.  hey. whoa. the scene ends in chaos. here is a muppet news flash.  dateline silver spring, maryland. at this very moment, mr. and mrs. george lazer of silver spring, are attempting to break the record for overhand refrigerator throwing, and... crash. a refrigerator lands near him. rowlf plays beethoven's "pathtique." a bust of beethoven sits upon his piano.   rowlf plays loudly to wake the dozing bust.  don't hum. yes, sir. the bust nods off again.  rowlf plays loudly to wake the bust, three times in a row. applause. open on a forest setting. kermit sits on helen's lap. you know, helen, you did a song about, um, oh, i don't know, a few years ago. it's one of my very favorite songs of all time. really. which one was it. well, it was called "you and me against the world". oh, sure. that was a song i did with my daughter. oh, yeah. yeah. you did it with your daughter. mmhmm. well, uh, do you suppose that, um, you could do it with a frog. music swells up. you mean just you and me. mmhmm. i think so. she and kermit sing the song. hey, beau. yes, sir. i see the floors are no longer slippery. oh, well, that's probably 'cause kermit told me to spread a little sand around. a little sand  somebody ought to teach you the meaning of "a little", though. zoom out to reveal scooter waistdeep in sand. kermit enters. i don't believe this. a camel enters. you believe that. piggy examines her stocking on the operating table. rowlf looks at her leg through a pair of binoculars. and now, veterinarian's hospital, the continuing stoooory of a quack who's gone to the dogs. hubba hubba.  oh. mmm. so, where's the next patient. oh, right here, dr. bob. oh. oh, look at that. hey, he looks cold. we'd better turn up the heat. dr. bob, those are not earmuffs he's wearing. he was in the recording studio. don't you know about headsets. of course. the head sets on the neck, the neck sets on the shoulders.   i learned that the first year in doctor class. dr. bob, have you forgotten about the patient. no, the patient is the one who's sick. i learned that the second year.  no, dr. bob, this patient. he's lost his hearing. well, maybe he dropped it some place. i'll look under the table. what kind was it. a clip on or one of those pierce jobs. not his earring, his hearing, dr. bob. this man can't hear anything. ehh. he's lucky. i've heard every dumb word. well, let's get these off.  there we go. can you hear me. of course i can hear you. not you, him. how can i hear him. he hasn't said a word.   if florence nightingale had to put up with this, she'd have been a waitress. well, i can't do anything about his hearing now. call me tomorrow. no, dr. bob. you're responsible for his ears. hmm. you're right. call me earresponsible, call me   they look up as the announcer speaks. and so we come to the end of another veterinarian's hospital. tune in next week when you'll hear dr. bob say... ah  no wonder he can't hear anything. he has a tiny little drum in there, it'll have to come out. no, no, no. that's his ear drum. that stays. what about the tiny little piano and bass. he laughs. piggy and janice groan. a group of outback whatnots sing a few choruses of "tie me kangaroo down, sport" as the entire scenery goes into a hopping frenzy, except for the kangaroo. well, uh, no more sand. and the slipperiness is gone.  hey, nice goin', guys. way to go. well, that takes care of the sand. yep. and i'm glad to be rid of it. yeah, i swept all the sand out of here. now, where did you put it. next door. but that's the stage.  what are we gonna do. what  what can we do. uh, get some costumes. costumes fozzie and scooter rush to his aid. scooter. get a couple of tents. fozzie, a palm tree.  tents.  palm tree. tents.  tents. tents. tents. and bring back that camel. camel. you're lucky. i just happen to have a palm tree here. main stage. kermit enters. uh, aand now once again, ladies and gentlemen, our very special guest star... uh, are you ready back there. no, we're not ready. oh... well, uh, i'll  i'll just tell you something about uh, helen reddy. i said we weren't ready. i wasn't talking to you. okay, we're ready. uh, ladies and gentlemen, helen reddy. oh, i hope this works. in a desert paradise, helen performs "we'll sing in the sunshine" while dancing with the camel. now, we could go on like this for hours, but we've grown to like you, so we'll stop. but not before we say thank you to our wonderful guest star, helen reddy. yaaay. applause as she comes out. thank you, kermit. i can't tell you how much i enjoyed working with a camel. oh, you say you enjoyed it. i said i can't tell you that. psst. hey, lady... you like him. he's yours. good grief. what's his name. sopwith. sopwith, the camel. uh, we'll see you next time on the muppet show. the muppets gather onstage as the credits roll. statler hits his own hand with a hammer. just as i thought. what's that. after this show, nothing hurts. he hits himself again. ) )
