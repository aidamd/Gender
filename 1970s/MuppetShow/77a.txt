"you and me". i know what it means. look, miss piggy, the "moon river" set is already being moved onstage, so forget it.  kermie  beauregard and beaker wheel a paper moon onstage. piggy stops them. hold it.. but kermit told us to put this on the stage. meemeemee. i don't care. just take that back and bring in the "love story" set. but if we did that, kermit would fire us.  would you rather be fired, or dismembered.  hmm. dismembered sounds like fun. beaker whispers in beau's ear.   we'll take fired. they move the moon away. main stage. kermit enters to a fanfare. uh, ladies and gentlemen, with us tonight is one of the world's great entertainers and recording artists, and here he is now, mr. andy williams.  psst. psst. psst. kermie. what. psst.  what. she pulls him behind the curtain. the curtain opens to reveal a wall with heartshaped windows. andy walks onstage and begins to sing. where do i begin to tell the story of how great a love can be. the sweet love story that is older than the sea, the simple truth about the love she brings to me. where do i start. the curtains in the windows open to reveal kermit in the center and piggy in the top left. with her first hello hello. they duck and move to different windows. she gave new meaning to this empty world of mine. they'll never be another love another time. aha. she came into my life and made the living fine. she fills my heart  aha. the windows open and close as kermit tries to flee from piggy. she fills my heart  kermie.  with very special things. with angel songs and wild imaginings. she fill my soul with so much love that any where i go  'scuse me. i'm never lonely. with her around who could be lonely. i reach for her hand, it's always there. how long does it last. can love be measured by the hours in a day. i have no answers now, but this much i can say la la la la  i know i'll need her until the stars all burn away, and she'll be there. he pulls kermit towards piggy, who gives both of them kissykissys. i wonder if we'll be called up as witnesses at the trial. what trial. well, you don't think andy's gonna take this lying down. they chuckle. kermit is not pleased as he and piggy come backstage. good number. nice number. kermiekins, don't be angryyyy. you know how i hate romantic junk like that. oh, congratulations, chief. i wish you all the happiness in the world. you'll need it.  what was that all about.  um oh, that scooter and his dumb little jokes. hahaha. hey, kermit  me and the band gonna play at the wedding. wh  what wedding.. piggy tiptoes away. well, i just heard the news that you and miss fatback was gonna tie the knot and raise chitlins.  piggy.. um    kermie, it's  just a joke. a joke people will think we're really engaged..   it's so sweetsounding when you say it. well  the engagement is off. hiyah. he karatechops her, but doesn't knock her over. her chop sends him flying to his desk.  on stage for the next number.  and now for this muppet newsflash. bands of roving cheeses have been reported at the edge of town, moving towards city center. the cheeses are reported to be smelly, and often in the company of crackers. uh, most of them seem to be moving about on foot, but some cheeses, naturally, are in wheels. a cheese wheel rolls over him. some rats chase after it. piggy fools around with medical equipment, then quickly rushes to the operating table. a rabbit is the patient. time once again for veterinarian's hospital, the continuing stoooory of a quack who's gone to the dogs. well, who's the first patient, nurse janice. here he is, dr. bob. aww, dr. bob, what a cute little bunny. i wonder what his name is. well, he hasn't said "eh, what's up doc," so it isn't youknowwho.  who, doctor. it's not "who, doctor," it's doctor who that's another show.  oh, oh, is he related to doctor which. no, it's not "doctor which", it's witch doctor, and that's another ball game.  oh, then doctor who's on first.  all i ask is the bunny's name, and i get abbott and costello.  hey, look can we get on with this. i'm late. i'm late. for a very important date.  no, that's another rabbit. oh, you're not the white rabbit. no, i'm the wrong rabbit.  fer sure. good grief. now it's rabbit and costello.  dr. bob, may i remind you this is a hospital. oh, i'm glad you did. the way the jokes were dying, i thought it was a morgue.  they all groan. hey, hurry up, will ya. i gotta get back to the hutch. the what. hutch. ththat's where rabbits live. i know that. i even know where it is. it's behind a famous cathedral. oh. you must have heard of it. the hutch back of notre dame.  the others groan. that rings a bell. they all groan, and look up when they hear the announcer. and so we come to the end of another veterinarian's hospital. good. tune in next week when you'll hear nurse janice say ... oh, dr. bob, that was rully a long way to go for that last joke. you should have packed a lunch.  i did. i ate it behind the cathedral. oh. yes. i had the lunch back of notre dame. they all groan and laugh. fer sure, for sure. backstage. sam looks over a clipboard. hi, sam.  oh.  oh. yes, hello. uh, still censoring the show, sam. yes, i am. have you seen what's happening in the canteen. uh, no  i've noted this down  there are seventeen penguins rehearsing for a tapdance number.  oh, good. good.. sure, that's what they're supposed to do. that is not decent family entertainment for this show. hey, sam, whwhy do you do this. someone has to do it. mmm. but don't you have a home, or something like that. oh, yes, i have a family. i'm married. mmhmm. really. you have a home. yes, well, uh  my wife and i are separated. oh. she, uh, flew the coop. do you have any uh, do you have any kids. we were very close, though. very close. oh yeah. what's her name. uh, i forgot. oh. but uh, do you have any kids. yes, i have two wonderful kids. oh. they never write to me. um, um  they're in college now. uhhuh. uh, boys or girls. mmhmm. yes. one boy. one boy, one girl. uhhuh. yeah. the boy's in college, uhhuh. yes. and what does he study. i'd rather not talk about it. he's uh, studying, uh  taxidermy. i see, i  that's good though, huh. no it's not. no, it's not very good, no  you don't know how bad. well, how about your daughter. i'd rather not talk about her either. she's uh  she's living a rather high life there in college. she's uh, dating, uh  an owl.  woowoo. exactly. hmm.  get back to this. what about this, all this indecent family entertainment. there's  besides the penguins, there's dogs singing and pigs and  there's a cheese singing "malaguea". oh, the cheese. i gotta check and see if the cheese is ready. oh, cheese.   you need not worry. as long as sam the eagle is here, i shall protect you, in the name of decent family entertainment.  yeah, bubut how'd you get started in show business. well, scooter, i started singing with my brothers, my three brothers, in wall lake, iowa. and we called ourselves the williams brothers. ah. clever. clever name. and we used to sing in church. and then uh, we started singing on the radio. oh, i guess you sang that old style music, huh. like acid rock. yeah, like ac  well, this was way before that. way, way back  we used to sing barbershop harmony. gee, i wish i'd heard that. andy sings "jubilee time" with a trio of andy williams muppet caricatures. hey, uh, what are all you cheeses doing backstage. oh, we want to try out for your show. yeah. we sing. oh yeah. what do you sing. one two three. so you met somebody that got you back on your heels  goudagouda. the cheeses laugh, then sing another one. i got a girl, crazy for me  cheese funny that way. the cheeses laugh. wait. wait, listen to this. pardon me, boys  is this the  cheddarnooga choochoo. the cheeses laugh. and what do you sing. oh, i don't sing. i'm in a tv series. uh, what. the roquefort files. the cheeses laugh. will you guys get outta here. out, out, out, out, out. the cheeses disperse. open on bunsen making baby talk to a cat as beaker watches. spoody boody. oh, mister boody boopers. boody boody boody. well. dr. bunsen honeydew, here at muppet labs, where the future is being made today. well, it's a wellknown fact that some people like doggies and some people like kitties.   up to now, if you were given the wrong pet, you had to put up with it. but our new electronic pet converter solves that problem. my assistant, beaker, is putting an unwanted kitty into the converter.  meep. yes, go. meep meep meep meep  he pushes the cat into the converter as it meows and hisses. oh, that's wonderful, beaker. and now, i throw the switch  and out of the other side comes  a cute little puppy dog. the puppy barks and licks beaker. and if you happen to like kitties instead of doggies, the converter works the other way. show them, beaker. byebye. bon voyage. the puppy goes back in to the box. now you can go get your kitty on the other side  it comes out as a tiger, to beaker's surprise. oh dear. oh, there seems to be some sort of problem. he tries to pull the tiger by the tail from the other end.  the important thing to remember is that anything that passes through this door is turned into a puppy dog. his hand is pulled through the door, sprouts eyes and hair, and begins barking. the tiger chases beaker around the lab. that's all for now, from muppet labs.  sit. sit. kermit and andy sit together on stools, holding microphones. you know, it's really neat to be sitting here to do a medley with andy williams, just like you used to do on your show, huh. well, thank you, kermit. uh, listen, by the way, may i ask you a question. why, sure. what. how do you do it. do what  you mean, sit on a stool like this. why, uh, any frog can do that. well, i knew that toads could, but uh  toads. what do you mean toads. well, surely you've heard of toad stools. he laughs. kermit frowns. you're still mad at me, aren't you. well  well, you did do "love story" instead of "moon river." well, that was miss piggy. i mean, she told me that you were engaged. yeah, well, it was very embarrassing. well  would it make you feel any better if you embarrassed me. what well, no  go ahead. go ahead. no, i couldn't  i can take it. okay, uh, let's see, uh  uh, i don't like your coat. good. does that make you feel better. yeah. yeah. now let's do the medley, huh. okay. mmhmm.  what don't you like about my coat.  uh, nothing, i was just saying that. well, go ahead, tell me. i mean, is it the sleeves, or the lapels, or the shoulders. no, no, i just  just forget that, huh. you're right. i mean, what would you know about clothes anyway. all you wear is that stupid collar.  it's a wonder you haven't been arrested. okay, that does it. start the music. the music starts. i'm only kidding, kermit. i love your collar. aw. well, actually, i like your coat too. well, thanks. except for the buttons. wha  i knew it was the buttons. i knew it. two of a kind. for your information, we're two of a kind. two of a kind. it's my observation, we're two of a kind. frogs in a pond  and birds of a feather alone or together you'll find, that we are twooooooo of a kind. i like the swamp in june, how about you. i like a gershwin tune, how about you. i love a lily pad when a storm is due. i like potato chips  mud flats and skinny dips  how about you. i don't believe in frettin' and grievin', why mess around with strife. i never was cut out to step and strut out. give me the simple life. some find it pleasant dining on pheasant. those things roll off my knife. i dine on mosquito, flies are a treato. give me the simple life. i love a piano. i love a piano. i love to hear somebody play upon a piano, a grand piano. it simply carries me away. so you can keep your fiddle and your bow. give me a piano, oh, oh. i love to stop right beside an upright, or a high toned baby grand. we're two of a kind. there's just no denyin', we're two of a kind. two of a kind. without even tryin', we're two of a kind. makin' it plain  explainin' it fully we're similalalarly inclined because we're twooooo of a kind uh, except, of course, that i'm a frog. twooooo, two of a kind. applause. okay, well, that is approximately sort of what you might call the end of the show, but before we go, let us say thank you to our wonderful guest star, ladies and gentlemen, andy williams. yaaaay. applause. kermit, i had a great time. oh, good. and i love the muppet cheese. the cheeses gather around him, as do some rats. uh, yeah, well, listen, if you like the cheese, did you get to meet the rats. well, rats can be fun, but cheese can be fundue.  the rats and cheeses laugh. uh, that's our kinda humor, andy. uh, we'll see you next time on the muppet show. gonzo looks on as the rats eat the cheese. the credits roll. i'm gonna see my lawyer. why. gonna find out if you can sue a show for breach of taste. they chuckle. ) )
