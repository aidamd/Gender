piggy and link hogthrob in a steamy jungle number. many people nowadays are returning to the natural life in search of peace and tranquility. well, this may change their mind. open on a jungle setting, where butterflies fly and birds try to eat them. piggy sits in a straw hut and sings the opening to "true love". link sings the first verse while swinging on a vine. he eventually hits the cliff and slides down. the tempo increases, and the jungle animals continue singing. a poacher fires at them with his shotgun. piggy and link resume the duet, but are quickly drowned out by the animals' loud noises. me waldorf, you statler.  no, you waldorf, me sick. sheesh. the cast walks past kermit. okay, nicely sung, piggy. thank you, kermie. yes, nicely sung, chimp. link swings by on the vine, crashing. and nicely swung, link.  ah, rowlf, on stage for your piano piece. i'm ready. don't worry. it'll be great. mmhmm. it won't be great. good, yes, but he plays it too fortissimo.

ladd. good. listen. uh, i've been, uh, reading a book here on selfimprovement. yeah. and it says, uh, it says, uh, i should ask my boss  that's you  uh, to make a list of my good points and my bad

gentlemen, our guest star tonight is best known for her dazzling performances on television. but acting is only one of the things she does well. see for yourself. here she is, cheryl ladd. cheryl sings "south rampart street parade" and dances with timmy monster while the clodhoppers play brass.  okay, pigs in space next. set up pigs in space. the cast passes by him. okay, boy, that was a great number. that cheryl ladd is terrific. yes, but that trumpet player kept going flat. if i remember my history, beethoven was supposed to be deaf. i'm not beethoven, dummy. i'm a bust of beethoven. of

dressing board. i'm a girl and by me that's only great. i am proud that my silhouette is curvy. i walk with a sweet and girlish gait, with my hips kinda swivelly and swervery. i adore being dressed in something frilly when my date comes to get me at my place. they both emerge wearing karate outfits. out i go with my joe or john or billy like a filly who is ready for the race. ahem. oh, oh. this is the dummy i practice on. oh, cheryl, how sweet. i have a dummy too. kermie.  yeah. whwhat do you want. now, sweetie, just trust me. yeah. ready. right. ahem. they both practice attacking their "dummies" as they sing. when i have a brand new hairdo  hah. with my eyelashes all in curls, i float like the clouds on air do. i enjoy being a girl.  i flip when a fella sends me flowers.  i drool over dresses made of lace.  i talk on the telephone for hours with a pound and a half of cream upon his face. what. cheryl hits him in the face with a pie. all right.  i'm strictly a female female yeah.  and my future i hope will be haha. they destroy the dressing room and gently end the song. in the home of a brave and free male, who'll enjoy being a guy  having a girl  like me. applause. kermit wipes the pie off his face. some entranced chickens stand behind him. huh, lemon meringue.  okay, gonzo, stand by for your hypnotism act. chickens, what are you doing here. shoo, shoo. kermit.

now, students of the occult, i shall demonstrate my amazing powers of hypnosis. i shall place a member of the audience in a trance. aided only by the mysterious strength of hypnotic suggestion, my subject will support, with only one hand, this   five thousand pound weight. who will be the first lucky volunteer. statler and waldorf look down at the crowd. well, it's just a question of mind over matter. that's right. you don't mind and we don't matter. they chuckle. you'll live to regret this. we intend to. they chuckle. i just don't understand you people. immortality is up for grabs. but you don't deserve it. no, but you do. they chuckle. what a terrific idea. i'll hypnotize myself. i'll go down in history. ahem. he looks in a hand mirror. look deep into my eyes.  make my mind a complete blank. my eyelids are getting heavy.  i am falling into my power. when i count three i will have the strength of an army. one, two, three. he gets under the weight and attempts to hold it up. release the ropes. the ropes are released. that's very impressive. but how do you get out of it. it's simple. i just snap my fingers. he snaps his fingers, and the weight falls on top of him. statler and waldorf laugh. gonzo, having been squished, lifts the weight off himself. hey kermit. it went terrific. he says it went terrific, but i know how he really feels. how's that.  about so high. they chuckle. kermit looks down at gonzo as he passes by. okay, that was a, uh, nice one, gonzo. it was a triumph. yeah. i don't know where you find these acts to do. oh, i just keep my ear to the ground. it looks like it.  main stage. kermit enters to applause. uh, you will all be happy to know that gonzo did survive that last act, and is about to embark on a new career as a lump.  but now it's time for our closing number. are we ready back there. who wants to know. i do. oh, oh, oh, yeah, sorry, boss. uh. uh, ladies and gentlemen, the wonderful miss cheryl ladd. cheryl and the muppets sing "sunshine on my shoulders" in a garden setting. well, it looks like we've come down to the end of another one. but, before we go, let us have a warm thank you for our very special guest, miss cheryl ladd. yaaay. applause. you know, kermit, i just wanted to tell you thank you. i have had so much fun working with the muppets. i wanna thank each one of you, starting from the top. oh, no. that means
