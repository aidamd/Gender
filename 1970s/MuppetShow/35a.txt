hi, ma. it looks like it's just you and me for the rest of the evening, folks. haaaaa. thought i'd come out and tell a few jokes, sing a few songs... fozzie, will you get off the stage. that too, yes. uh, let's see now, where was i. ahem. uh, ladies and gentlemen, it's very seldom we have a guest puppeteer on this show. in fact, between you and me, it's rare that we have any puppeteers on the show. so it gives me great pleasure to introduce a very talented young man, mr. bruce schwartz. guest puppeteer bruce schwartz performs a bunraku ballerina puppet. oh, that puppet looked so alive. well, that's more than i can say for you.  rowlf the dog, baskerville and afghan hound sing "mad dogs and englishmen". okay, kermit, now you're going to introduce me, right. uh, no. but kermit, my mother is in the audience. when do i go on. when do you go on. you've already been in all the introductions, pigs in space, and everything else. what do you want, star billing. that would be nice. will you get out of here.  yes, sir. yes, sir. open on the chef, dancing with two pots.   brk brk brk. he tosses the pots and prepares to give a demonstration, when cleo shows up.  excuse me. you look like a very understanding person, and maybe you can solve my problem for me. you see i hear singing and there's no one there. i smell blossoms and the trees are bare. all day long i seem to walk on air. i wonder why. i wonder why. can you tell me why. the chef sings the secondary part, as he makes a salad. let's get this together, shall we. the two sing their verses simultaneously as they finish making the salad. the chef plays a frying pan as a ukulele as the song ends. cleo tastes the salad and reacts in disgust, then hugs the chef. applause. well, i just learned something about the swedish chef i didn't know before. what's that. cooking is the second worst thing he does. they chuckle. and now, ladies and gentlemen...  kermit, kermit, please, now me, please. yes, now. thank you. thank you. uh, now, ladies and gentlemen, uh, due to an overwhelming demand... from him, if not from the rest of us... here he is, our own furry funny man, fozzie bear. the curtain opens on fozzie as his fanfare plays. hey, hey. thank you, thank you, thank you and thank you. yes. tonight, because there is a certain someone special in the audience, i will do a special act. phrenology. phrenwhat. and  and  and for this demonstration, i will need a volunteer.  fozzie, what are you  what are you gonna do. trust me, it's for my mother. okay. okay, gang... phrenology. the art of reading a person's fortune by feeling the bumps on his head. okay. now, here we go. mm. well, i can tell you're a very flexible person. mm. fozzie. yes, okay, okay, here we go. uh  i can see in your future...  tomorrow, yes,

you're gonna what. fozzie whacks kermit on the head with a mallet. you will notice  fozzie.. will you get outta here..  the curtain closes as fozzie's fanfare plays. robin comes onstage and looks around. hi. uh, uncle kermit's kinda busy right now, so i don't think he'd mind if i tell you that here now, accompanied by the puppet artistry of bruce schwartz, is the lovely miss cleo laine.  cleo sings the melancholic "if," while bruce schwartz accompanies her with another puppetry performance. well, i think we've come down to the end of it. but before we go, let's have a warm thank you for our special guest star, ladies and gentlemen, miss cleo laine. applause. the muppets gather around cleo. yeah, yeah. yeah. yeah. oh, thanks, kermit. it's been a lot of fun, really. oh, thank you. yeah. hey fozzie  hmm.  did your mum enjoy the show. oh, i don't know. i haven't even had time to ask her. oh, listen, fozzie, why don't you ask her. okay. ahem. uh, hey, mom. how'd you like the show.

they chuckle. ) )
