any more of this. yeah, let's leaf. oh, boy. ah, that turkey talks ragtime. blah, blah, blah. link stands there, confused. this is kermit the frog speaking to you from the planet koozebane, and today i am interviewing a most unfortunate creature, the koozebanian phoob. thank you, thank you. i'm pleased to be here. as a matter of fact, i'm pleased to be anywhere. i can believe that because you see, folks, the phoob is known as the most delicious creature on koozebane. that's true. we have a saying on this world: "i never met a phoob i didn't like, especially with mushroom gravy." uh, i suppose this tends to hold down the phoob population pretty effectively. not really. actually, my species is flourishing. really. well, how do you manage that. evolution. i... i don't think i understand. we phoobs tend to evolve rather faster than most creatures. mmhmm. well, what do you evolve into. oh, you know. whatever's handy. i... i beg your pardon. we try to blend in with the crowd as best we can. say, are... are you changing. evolving. evolving is the accurate term. yeah, but... but you're starting to look familiar. i should certainly hope so.  this  this is very weird. the phoob is now a replica of kermit. good grief. even your clothes are the same. it's called the survival of the trenchcoated. yeah, but... but you can't do this. uh, this is kermit the frog, returning you to... i'm kermit the frog. i am. i am. the two kermits start fighting.  uh, these are kermit the frogs, returning you to the muppet show. they resume fighting. you can't do that. will you stop.. i'm the real kermit, folks. wonderful. very funny. eh, waldorf. hey, i wonder where he went. he was here a minute ago, watching the phoob and falling down laughing. he's hanging from the balcony. i'm still falling, but i've stopped laughing.  sam sits in the balcony with statler. uh, mr. statler, there aren't too many people on this show i like to talk to. well, i can understand that. they're kind of weird. "weird" is too nice a word.  but you and your friend seem to be very distinguished gentlemen. uh, by the way, where is your friend. oh, uh, i don't know. he must have stepped out for a minute. stepped out is right. hey, give me a hand, huh. well, i'm sure he didn't go far. yeah, he's probably hanging around somewhere. uh, hanging around is right. help. mr. statler, what i find hard to understand is why you come here every night. well, uh, it gets me out of the house. but there are many better places to go than, than this freak show. there's the symphony, the ballet, the opera. help. help. never go to the opera. can't stand all that screaming and yelling. help. you just don't understand opera. oh, i understand it all right. i just hate it. i'd rather go to a public hanging. you are at a public hanging. pull me up. does your friend waldorf feel as strongly as you. i don't have any feeling at all. my hand is numb. i don't know. why don't you ask him. maybe i will. i will drop by later. i'm gonna drop right now if somebody doesn't help me. but... but wherever he is, it's good to know that at least we have you two gentlemen here to provide dignity and decency. he bangs his fist on the banister. waldorf falls. they look down. open on judy playing the piano. pan over to rowlf, at another piano. hey, thank you, judy. you know, i really want to thank you for wanting to play this number with me. i'm just honored. oh, it's a pleasure for me, rowlf. thank you. what is that you're playing right now. oh, these are just finger exercises. i play them to warm up before i play. really. what do you do to warm up. oh, i chase cars. oh, dear. i'd much rather play finger exercises. when i was a kid, you know, i used to play these and put a book up in front of me and read while i practiced. oh... i guess that's easy for you. but, you know, it's tough to play the piano and chase cars at the same time. how about playing a duet with me. oh, listen, that's why i'm here. ok. they do a duet of "doremi."  oh, no, what am i gonna do. hi, kermit. what's happening. oh, gonzo, haven't you heard the news. no. well, scooter's uncle's gonna tear this theater down.  no. yes. and he's gonna build a junkyard on this very spot. no. yes. oh, what a terrific idea for an act.  what. i wish i'd thought of it.  now there goes a real trouper. open on the chef with two forks.   brk brk brk. he tosses them aside and displays the bowl, then a head of lettuce, then a blunderbuss.   de lttce ... de bmbm. he tosses the lettuce in the air, shoots it, and down comes    de sld. ever eat any of that swedish chef's food. are you kidding. if i did, i'd be dead. that's why i asked. the chef displays another head of lettuce and the blunderbuss.  he tosses the lettuce in the air, shoots it, and down comes    de brssels sprots. oh, they're going to get that swedish chef some day. who is. the smorgasbord of health. they chuckle. meanwhile, backstage scooter. what is it, kermit. you're the only one who can talk your uncle out of tearing this theater down. oh, gee, i don't think so, kermit... well, sure you can. appeal to his sense of art. tell him about all the people who'll be out of work. sorry, kermit. including you. wait right here.  hey, uncle j.p. huh. you can't tear this theater down. oh, sure i can. i've got the junk yard all planned. gonna put the old cars right here and the old tires over there. well, what about your sense of art. art who. well, what will all these people do for money. oh, let 'em spend cake. well, what about me. oh, well, i was going to put you in charge of the junkyard. what do you say to that, kid. he picks up a sledgehammer. let's get started, uncle partner. he starts whacking the intercom. kermit gets in his way and gets whacked. scooter. aah. meanwhile, back in the kitchen, the chef displays a coconut and the blunderbuss.  ... de ccont,  de bmbm.  he tosses the coconut in the air, shoots it, and down comes a rubber chicken.  ... chickie. bop. the coconut falls on his head. well, did you find all that interesting. no, i was smorgasbored. they chuckle. bored. bored. they chuckle. the lights dim. ladies and gentlemen, miss judy collins. judy sings "send in the clowns" as the clowns dance. main stage. kermit enters to applause. well, we made it through another one, mostly with the help of our wonderful guest star, miss judy collins. yaaay. thank you. it's been wonderful. oh, i'm very glad. you know, mostly because this may be our last show. oh, no. yeah. scooter's uncle still wants to tear this place down. no, cancel that plan. i'm not gonna tear this place down. you're not. naw, it'd be a waste of money. this dump's gonna fall in on its own. look at this floor. he stomps on the floor and falls through it. uh, well, we'll see you all next time on the muppet sh whaa.. he and other muppets fall through the stage floor as the credits roll. this theater's as solid as a rock. watch this. he stomps on the floor and falls through it. ) )
