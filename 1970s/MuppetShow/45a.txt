contents the dressing room. scooter knocks on the door and opens it. gilda radner. gilda radner. thirty seconds to curtain, miss radner.  well, scooter, what's all this fuss i keep hearing about me doing the muffin show. i mean, what kind of a show is it about muffins. why, the next thing you know, they have me do a show with rye bread, or little, tiny lovely biscuits. why, i can't do a show

curtain opens, and the theme begins. i always get butterflies before a show. not this time.  red smoke comes out of gonzo's horn. gonzo hiccups a second red cloud. main stage. kermit enters to applause. thank you, thank you and welcome again to the muppet show. hey, tonight, we have with us one of america's brightest young comediennes, miss gilda radner. but first, let us take a moment to consider the folk music of the north american eskimo. here is a traditional lullaby from beyond the antarctic circle... or somewhere. eskimo pigs sing "lullaby of broadway." they are joined by a walrus, a penguin, a bear, and a chicken. before the big finish, a miner emerges. hey, norton, i don't think this is 42nd street. and cue the big finish. weird. why did they want the igloo. what. why did they want the igloo. well, maybe someone broke their ig. they chuckle. the penguin, walrus, chickens and pigs walk by. okay, okay.  do eskimos have chickens. good number, but move it, move it, move it. i can't. i've got a broken ig.  gilda emerges from her dressing room, in a pinafore and hat. she makes her way towards kermit. ah... it's gilda radner.  hi, kermit. hi there. listen, i want to really thank you for letting me do the operetta number. i love operetta, and no one's ever given me a chance to do one before. oh, well, you're welcome. have you got my parrot. your what. my parrot. my sevenfoottall talking parrot. a  a sevenfoottall talking parrot. right. i wrote you in the letter. well, well, i got your letter, but i couldn't quite read your handwriting. a parrot. well, what'd you think i asked for. well i i wasn't really sure. i thought it was a...  never mind. a sevenfoottall taking carrot emerges from another room and comes downstairs. must i share my dressing room with the other vegetables. a seven foot tall talking carrot. watch it, lady, i'm a star. i sang the hit song from cole. cole. cole porter. cole slaw. they paid him a huge celery.  now she's stealing my jokes. well, i have to do something. i don't have an opening number now. why not. well, i was going to do selections from the parrots of penzance. the parrots of penzance. yeah, well it's better than the carrots of penzance. come on, vitamin brains. she leads the carrot to the stage. fozzie passes by, bewildered. ker... ker... ker... kermit. gilda radner and a sevenfoottall talking carrot.  well, i introduce 'em. i don't explain 'em.  uh... few performers are brave or foolhardy enough to tackle the blinding complexity of the following musical number. but here she is, tempting fate, miss gilda radner. open on a ballroom setting. gilda stands at the top, making her way downstairs as she sings. i am the very model of a modern majorgeneral. i've information, vegetable, animal and mineral. i know the kings of england and i quote the fights hysteric, from marathon to...  enter the carrot. hold it. hold it. maestro, please.  you blew it, my child.  never send a girl in to do a carrot's work.  ooh, if i knew a 12foot rabbit, you'd really be in trouble. why don't we try an easy one, hmm. maestro, please. a slower tempo plays. when a carrot's not engaged in his employment his employment or maturing his felonious little plans little plans his capacity for innocent enjoyment ...cent enjoyment is just as great as any honest man. honest man. our feelings we with difficulty smother... ...culty smother  when our vegetary duty's to be done. to be done. i'll take one consideration with another. with another. a carrot's lot is not a happy one.  the music stops. wait a minute. who are these guys. they're my backup group. they travel with me everywhere. what have you got. a chauffeurdriven shopping cart.  why don't you just stand back and let me show you how it's done. the music of "modern major general" resumes. i am the very model of a modern majorgeneral. i've information, vegetation, animable oh...  hold it, hold it. see, you didn't make it either. maybe i didn't want to make it.  why don't you sing, gilda. soft music plays. poor wand'ring one, though thou hast surely strayed take heart of grace, thy steps, retrace. poor wand'ring one. poor wand'ring one, if such poor love as mine  can help me find true peace of mind why, take it, it is...   it is thine. the music picks up tempo. here we go. i am the very model of a modern majorgeneral. i've information, vegetable animal and mineral. i know the kings of england... and i quote the fights historical... from marathon to waterloo in order categorical. in military knowledge, though i'm plucky and adventury has only been brought down to the beginning of the century. but still in matters vegetable animal and mineral i am the very model of a modern majorgeneral. but still in matters vegetable animal and mineral, i am the very model of a modern majorgeneral. applause. the carrot accidentally knocks gilda to the ground while they bow. you know, usually operetta music puts me right to sleep.  you too, huh. heh heh. uh... ladies and gentlemen, a muppet melodrama. the curtain opens on a scene of piggy hanging on the edge of a cliff, as uncle deadly watches and cackles. suspenseful piano music plays. help. oh... and now, for the last time, my little peach pie, will you marry me. the audience boos and hisses. drop dead. i think that might be my line, my dear.  oh, where, oh, where is

ol. ol. wayne steps on piggy's hands, causing her to lose her grip and fall off the cliff screaming. wayne and deadly exclaim and congratulate each other. i suppose you think that's funny. i think you might well start with a new pair of boots. they both depart the scene. marvin suggs directs the little fuzzballs towards the stage. all right, muppaphones, move it, move it, move it, move it.. wayne and deadly pass by, still dancing. how am i doing. any better. yes. yes, you're getting it, you're getting it. she karatechops deadly, kicks wayne, and struts off. main stage. kermit enters. uh, ladies and gentlemen, it is time, once again, for a return engagement of the incomparable marvin suggs. uh, i say "incomparable" because i can't imagine anything to compare him to. ahem. anyway, here

pay, then he'd call on nell. trousers neatly pressed, and nice, white vest. button holed bouquet, as well. on nellie's little hat, there was a little bird., that little bird knew quite a lot. it did, upon my word. and in its quiet way, it had a lot to say, as the lovers strolled along. i'll be your little honey, i can promise that. said nellie as she rolled her dreamy eyes. it's a shame to take the money said the bird on nellie's hat. last night she said the same to jimmy wise. then to nellie, willy whispered as they fondly kissed... i bet that you were never kissed like that. heh heh ... well, you don't know nellie like i do. said the saucy little bird on nellie's hat. oh, it's twelve o'clock said willie, as he took her home. now, i bet you're never out as late as that. hmm. well, you don't know nellie like i do. said the saucy little bird on nellie's hat. autumn came along. love's young dream gone wrong. will went 'round to call. servant with a grin said... she's not in. nellie's gone away. that's all. poor willie's heart was broke. his life seemed all in vain, until upon 5th avenue he met his nell again. said he: we meet once more. said she: love's dream is o'er, but we can still be real good friends. and i'll keep your presents, honey, just for old times sake. said nellie as she rolled her dreamy eyes. she's fixed him good and plenty. said the bird on nellie's hat. oh, really, willie, when will you be wise. yes, but how about the diamond engagement ring. of course, said willie, you'll return me that. oh, brother said the saucy little bird on nellie's hat. bunsen examines a glue tube, then notices he's on camera. oh. ahem. uh, dr. bunsen honeydew, here at muppet labs, where the future is being made, today. and here with me, is the lovely miss gilda radner. thank you, dr. honeydew. today we have an amazing demonstration. and gilda here has graciously volunteered to be our human guinea pig. i have. good. that's settled then. ahem. oh. i shall need you, too, beaker. come on in here. beaker enters, meeping. now we're ready to begin. uh, listen, dr. honeydew, you said "assistant". i never heard you say the word "guinea pig".  uh, just put your head down here, so uncle bunny can work on you. well, you see, i don't mind assisting, but i'm not crazy about the idea of guinea pigging. she lowers her head towards bunsen. he dabs a dab onto her forehead. mhmm. there we go. blink. there. i have just placed on gilda's forehead, a single teensy weensy drop of muppet's new super adhesive. now we'll wait a moment for it to get tacky. what are we waiting for. for it to get tacky. another first on this show. how's that. well, it's the first time we've had to wait for it to get tacky. they chuckle. and with that single drop of glue, i shall stick this rope to gilda's forehead, and then beaker and i shall haul on the rope, thus lifting miss radner bodily off the floor.  no, no no no no. wait a minute. i can't  that's okay, gildapoo, that's all right. now, beaker, i hope you're feeling fit. beaker demonstrates his fitness by pulling on a chestexercise coil. that's good. ok... oh.  uh... oh, there was glue on the rag.  maybe it says something about a... oh, wait. oh, no, wait. don't squeeze that tube. too late. she accidentally squirts glue all over the place. oh, i'm sorry... what do we do now. well, let me consult my notes. she notices beaker, stuck to his coil and yelping. oh, you're stuck. oh, beaker, wait a minute, here, i'll help you. wait a minute. her hand sticks to the coil. she slaps her hand on her forehead, and it sticks as well. beaker screams. bunsen grabs the rope, which is stuck to his coat along with some papers, and winds up pulling himself up. whoa. whoa. er, it wasn't meant to go this way. that's all for now from muppet labs. beaker. help your uncle bunny. whoaaaa the scene ends in chaos as comical music plays.  well, that must be the glue, all right. well, what glue is that. the one they mend the ig with. they chuckle. kermit talks on the phone. yeah, well, okay. here she comes now, mr. scribbler. i'll ask her. uh, gilda. gilda passes, still stuck to bunsen and beaker. uh, gilda, a reporter would like to know, what is the secret of your success. kermit, can i talk to you for a second.  uh, well, i guess you could just say that she has stuck with it.  oh, yeah, you could say that.  and in the little time i've known her, she's really cemented our friendship. beaker springs back towards gilda. beaker and bunsen begin slapping each other. i've heard of close friends, but this is ridiculous. okay, well, byebye. he notices his hand is stuck to the receiver. zoot and rowlf walk by. hey, guys, get on stage.  oh  the intro. oh, oh, help. kermie, my sweet, i was  yes. piggy, piggy, not right now. i'm stuck on the phone... uh  literally. oh, kermie, all this work and worry, my frog oh, piggy don't touch me. oh, froggypoo. now i'm stuck on you. oh, at last, my frog wants me. oh, thank you.  oh... oh... will you let... will you  get away from me. what is this.  zoot and rowlf play "body and soul," but rowlf soon starts playing one chord. zoot, my fingers are glued to the piano. zoot toots some sour notes, and notices  i can't get my saxophone out of my mouth. let's get out of here. they drag themselves and their instruments off stage. here is a muppet newsflash. the great glue threat is over. the rogue adhesive is under control, but... he notices his hands are stuck to the paper. he walks out, stuck to his chair. oh, everything is under... meanwhile, piggy is still stuck to kermit, but now more amorous. oh, kermiepoo. piggy, you're putting all your weight on me. mmhmm. maybe we shall be stuck like this forever. the newsman passes. i don't think i can go on supporting you that long. well, if you think i'm gonna go out and work... kermit tries to get away from her, but to no avail. uh, can, can we get the band ready. get the band ready. the band members pass by them. kermit still tries to move. come on, you guys. piggy... what. hey, floyd, what is gonzo doing back there. oh, he's watching television. yeah, well, shouldn't he be further from the screen. nope. his eyes are glued to the set. oh, my... kermit and piggy continue to play tugofwar with each other. fozzie, would you introduce the next number.  oh, boy.. uh, hi. we're having a little trouble back here, but uh, that's okay, that's okay. let's just give a great big hand for our very special guest star. oh, no, my hand is stuck... uh... uh... miss gilda radner. he screams as the curtain pulls him up. the band starts playing as gilda, still stuck to the coil and with a hand stuck to her forehead and the other stuck to one shoe, gingerly makes her way through a rendition of "tap your troubles away". she soon realizes she can put the shoe on. during her tap solo, she swings beaker from one side of the stage to another and back. a piece of the set sticks to her back, and floorboards stick to her shoes. at the very end, her other hand sticks to the wall. a huge glob of moaning muppets, and gilda, make their way to the stage. to the left, to the left. keep going, keep going. a little bit more. keep going a little bit more... to the left. hold it, hold it. too far. back a little bit. back, back, back. okay, that about does it for another regular, nothing out of the ordinary, everything under control muppet show. and uh, somewhere back amongst us is our very special guest star. uh, she's the one behind us here, miss gilda radner. yaaay. applause. thanks, kermit, it's been great. i just can't seem to tear myself away. yeah, okay, uh, well, that's all for now, we'll see you next time on the muppet show. okay, everybody bow. they all strain to bow as the credits roll. goodnight. so long. they both notice that they're stuck to the balcony. oh, no. ) )
