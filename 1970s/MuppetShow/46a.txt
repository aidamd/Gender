contents the dressing room. scooter knocks and peers in. pearl bailey. pearl bailey. fifteen seconds to curtain, miss bailey. i'll be there, honey, as soon as somebody calls off these oysters. pearl. come back to us, pearl. back. back. heel. heel. oh, clam up. they laugh. oh, this is a strange place ... it's the muppet show, with our very special guest star, miss pearl bailey. yaaaay. the curtain opens, and the theme begins. everybody on stage.   everybody is on stage. i'm not even gonna try it. his trumpet blows a note on its own. main stage. kermit enters to applause. thank you, thank you, and welcome, again, to the muppet show. i can't tell you what a kick i get when i think of all of you out there watching us. you know, it sends a chill right up my spine. whoo. uh... there it was, right there. as a matter of fact, here comes another one. whoo. uh, uh, uh... that one is for our very special guest star. she is one of the most wonderful stars of the whole entertainment world, and she told me just before the show that her papa was a preacher, which is a wonderful reason for doing the following number. ladies and gentlemen, miss pearl bailey. pearl performs "my soul is a witness" with a backup choir of muppets, including wayne, nigel, zoot, janice, and some pigs and whatnots. well, how'd you like that. i don't know, i'll ask the avocado. the avocado appears. well, what'd you think. ooh, loved it, loved it, loved it. that's amazing. no, it's not. he's been a pearl bailey fan for years. they chuckle. the muppet choir passes by kermit. dr. bunsen goes in the other direction. ok, nice number, nice number. get on stage, bunsen. oh, wow, kermit. like i rully don't believe this weird trip you're putting us on. uh, what's that, janice. the band tonight just flashed on the closing number. the band just flashed. mmhmm. rully. i mean, you know, kermit, sometimes i just don't know what space you're coming from. well, it's just a sort of a regular, backstage space. rully, kermit, you don't expect us to do that jousting number from camelot. um, well, uh, in a word... yes. ewwwwww. oh, kermit, floyd has something to say on that. honey, you tell him. floyd emerges in a cumbersome suit of armor. oh, my little green friend huh.  you have much indeed to learn about today's slang. well, uh, how do you mean, floyd. well, when i said i wanted to get into something heavy for the final number... mmmhmm... ...sir knight of the iron wasn't it.  look out. he collapses on the floor. kermit yelps and grabs his leg. fractured flipper. oh. oh. oh. tinker, tinker, fiddle...  oh. ahem. dr. bunsen honeydew here at muppet labs, where the future is being made today. well, i've got some news here to tickle your fancy. because here they are, friends, the answer to your prayers. muppets allnew edible paper clips. now, the honor of tasting this first batch of delicious paper clips goes, of course, to my helpful and eager assistant, beaker.  uhuh. oh, beaker, what is the matter. oh, that's very naughty, beaker. now you eat these clips this minute. go on, eat. he shrugs, and proceeds to eat some. they're not so bad, go ahead. beaker finds he actually likes them. mmm. yes. good. yes, friends, muppets edible paper clips are delicious, nutritious and nickelplated. they're handy around the office, and they're wonderful as a tv snack. furthermore, they are absolutely harmless. beaker's nose falls off. aah. meep meep meep meep  or nearly so. poor fellow lost his nose. hmm. how will he smell without it. same as always... terrible.  dr. honeydew, is beaker all right. oh, he'll be fine. i'll just go invent some nose glue. come on, beaker. beaker holds his nose in his hand as bunsen leads him away. meanwhile, floyd is still wearing the armor. yeah, but, hey, i'm talking about serious, kermit. mmmhmm. i mean, why cast me. this knight business is a actor's gig. yeah. and i am a musician, remember. yeah, well, floyd, i wanted you to play the knight because you fit the part. you see, uh, you're the only one of us with real gallantry. the only one of us with real honor. the only one of us who'd fit in that iron suit.  scooter, i needed that like i need a broken leg. oh, you need a broken leg. i'll fall on you again.  no, no, no. floyd, no, no. now, listen, this is a great chance for you. besides, in the same jousting scene, you get to fight the black knight. who is the black knight. well, that's part of the fun. you see, no one will know. it's kept a complete and absolute mystery. hmm... a familiar figure enters, wearing funnylooking armor. the world will forever wonder who i am. though some may harbor suspicions. two chickens play "the bells of st. mary's" on the chimes, knocking them over at the end. they fight with each other. here is a muppet news flash. an explosion has just taken place at the smithfield hat factory. reports say that hats are falling all over the... hats immediately fall on him. floyd and pearl share a laugh. all right. listen, floyd, i sure am glad you got out of that iron suit, man. oh, yeah. that was a stone drag. oh, it had to be, but i'm telling you, you're lookin' good now with the purple threads. oh, yeah. my main squeeze gave me this. oh, you are clever. ha ha. listen, come here a minute. i wanna ask you a question. yeah. do the rest of the musicians, do they know you're in here. hmm... no, uhuh. well, crazy. listen. what if you and me, see, or you and i, either one they laugh. what if we did a little number together. and then, if we went over, who knows, we could take over the whole thing. pearly may... huh. nothing would please me more. i thought it would. he plays his bass. you jump right into it, man. let me jump in there with you. they sing "in the good old summertime". rowlf plays the piano. fozzie emerges with a top hat. hididdledeedee. an actor's life for me. a high silk hat and a silver cane, a watch of gold with a diamond chain. hididdledeedoo. you sleep till after two. you promenade with a big cigar, you tour the world in a private car, you dine on chicken and caviar, an actor's life for me. ha. okay, what happens now. oh, now comes the funny part.  well, leaving the stage is funnier than a lot of things the bear does. fozzie comes back with a fish. ok, now, ask me what i'm carrying the fish for. oh, fozzie, what are you carrying the fish for. oh, just for the halibut.  eh, you were better off leaving the stage. ha. he tosses the fish and it splashes. hididdledeedee. an actor's life for me. a high silk hat and a silver cane, a watch of gold with a diamond chain. hididdledeedoo. you sleep till after two. hey, fozzie, this number needs help. no, it doesn't, it needs scenery. a decorative vaudeville backdrop is lowered. oh, it's wonderful scenery. but is it funny. ok, now, ask me what i'm carrying the hoop for. oh, fozzie, what are you carrying the hoop for. ah, because statler and waldorf are always saying the show is hoopless.  "just for the halibut." keep trying.  oh, boy. hididdledeedee. an actor's life for me. a high silk hat and a silver cane, a watch of gold with a diamond chain. hididdledeedoo. you sleep till after two. you promenade with a big cigar, you tour the world in a private car, you dine on chicken and caviar, an actor's life for me. an actor's life for me. open on link, drawing on a notepad. when we last left the swinetrek, it was hopelessly lost in outer space. hmm... if the timeless endlessness of eternal space is about that big  and then our spaceship is down here ...possibly  or... excuse me, link, what's in the corner there. uh, that's a duckie.  we need to go in this direction up here  or possibly over... oh, no, no, no. oh, we're lost. lost in space. why won't he admit it.  well, just give me time. i got lost once before and i found my way out. lost in the outer galaxies, link. no, in a phone booth. he tastes the pencil. hmm... this pencil is delicious. there is no time for that now. we must either find out our position, or we will perish. oh. oh, which is it to be, link. prunes.  prunes. prunes was not a choice. this is a pencilshaped prune. a readout comes through on the fax machine. wait. i see by the readout here  that we are passing through a field of deadly snacka waves. dramatic sting. snacka waves. ja, ja. at this very moment, they are tuning everything aboard this ship into food.  my prune pencil. ridiculous. her head turns into a chocolate cake. including this readout, which is now a frozen chicken dinner for two. link and strangepork devour the readout. oh, it's delicious. they gasp when they see what's happened to piggy. oh. wh what happened. what does it look like. chocolate layer cake. aha. dessert. desert. don't you dare desert.  his head turns into a head of cauliflower. ha. ha. look at old cabbage head. it's a cauliflower. slurping noises are heard. shh. listen.  the crew have started to eat the ship. i find that a bit hard to swallow. the crew is eating the ship. are you going bananas. no... his head turns into  ...scallions. oh, what are we going to do with a halfeaten spacecraft. have it cold for sandwiches tomorrow. two more crew members enter, with vegetables for heads. commotion ensues. a floating saucepan follows the swinetrek. fade out.  ok, staging, you can strike that spaceship. the foodheads pass kermit. piggy still has a cake for a head. oh, kermie. kermie. why, piggy. you've never looked better.  you're skatin' on thin ice, frog. uh, yeah. makeup. makeup.   ok. oh, boy, oh, boy, chief, are we in trouble. well, what now. well, you know how you're planning to do the jousting scene from camelot. of course. that's the show's big finale. yeah, well, the people that published the  the music from camelot just called and  they won't let you do it. what.. i was willing to give them credit. i would've given them a big buildup. i would have given anything to do the jousting scene. they want money.  uh, cancel the jousting scene. gee whiz, chief. i thought you said we had $14.95 in the cash box. yeah, well, i spent $13.50 on the suits of armor. what are we gonna do. what can we do. there's only one thing to do. what's that. whatever comes next. oh. they look at the rundown. couples dance in a ballroom. mildred dances with a pig. are you a real professor. of course. i hold the chair of philosophy. oh. where's that. right here. he displays a chair. they chuckle. cut to another couple. you seem to have a lot on your mind. oh, yeah. i've got a wife and child to support. they're on his back. cut to another couple. say... uh  are we poisonous. i don't know. why. oh, nothing, really. i i just bit my tongue. floyd dances with janice, while gonzo dances with camilla. oh, wow. they're not too light on their feet. ow. not too light on mine, either. gonzo falls down, taking camilla, janice and floyd with him. ooh, terrific. terrific, wonderful. say, is your friend, the avocado here, some kind of professional critic. nah. he's just unemployed.  you should go to work. try to make something of yourself. oh, like what. guacamole. they chuckle. fozzie, gonzo, janice and floyd watch kermit as he paces. men, this is a command decision. we're going to have to cancel the joust. they gasp. bummer. what.. it'll be fun. it'll be snazzy. it'll be dumb. oh, rully. hey, no, dig on it. for once, old green stuff speaketh the truth. no  kermit. kermit, i am sorry to have to do this... what. but my career is at stake. now you move. fozzie and janice follow gonzo's lead and shove kermit onstage. gonzo and floyd stay behind, laughing. yes, yes, move, i'll take care of it. move, kermit, yes, move. hey, tell me, just between the two of us, do you really think this will work. no. isn't it terrific. fozzie pushes kermit. come on, just introduce us, okay. okay, okay, okay, okay. okay. okay. uh, ladies and gentlemen, uh, we were planning to do the jousting scene from camelot, uh, but i do think we should cancel this, but... fozzie signals for gonzo to poke kermit with his sword.  but there's been a very pointed argument against canceling. hah, good work, gonzo.  so, anyhow, wish us luck, folks, because here is our special guest star, miss pearl bailey and the muppet players in what almost might, sort of, kind of like be considered the jousting scene from camelot. open on a medieval jousting scene setting. every duke and earl and peer is here. everyone who should be here is here. what a smashing, positively dashing spectacle we're here to see today. king rowlf stands between piggy and janice. and now, may i present her royal majesty, queen guinevere, who will welcome you, officially, to our annual joust. enter queen pearl, to applause and jazzy music. hello, fellas. well, hello, fellas. it's so nice to be back home where i belong. you're looking swell, fellas. i can tell, fellas, you're still crowin', you're still growin', you're still goin' strong. the

go away, pearlie will never go away, pearlie will never go away again. ha ha. applause. thank you, your majesty. and now to introduce the contestants for this year's joust. a whatnot plays "first

watch the melee. you know, rowlf, this don't make any sense at all. i know, pearl, but we're stuck with it. let the joust begin. a trumpet fanfare is played as floyd and gonzo take their positions. thank you. giddyup. whoa. the crowd cheers as the jousters charge towards each other. they miss, then turn around, miss again, turn around, and finally collide. hey, you guys all right down there. oh,

usual. floyd and gonzo emerge, still sore from wearing their armor. mixedup is not the word. no, twisted is the word. listen, guys, i'll get you a pair of tin snips in a minute. as soon as i say, let us have a warm thank you to our very special guest star, miss pearl bailey. yaaaay. pearl comes out. applause. you know something, kermit. hmm. i can get those guys out of that suit of armor. i'm an expert at it. oh, really. did you used to be a costumer. no. i was a welder. she reveals a torch and starts going to work on gonzo and floyd. i'm not sure i want to watch this. we'll see you next time on the muppet show. the other muppets clamor onstage as the credits roll.  will you move. let the crew work, will you. the lady's trying to work. i didn't like it. what'd the avocado think. it's the pits. they chuckle. the avocado falls backward. ) )
