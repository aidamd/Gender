bert  what.   buckle up, and we'll fly away   whoa. yeah.   we're adventuring    every time the bed starts tapping    something special's gonna happen   this is kind of catchy.   my favorite kind of traveling   hyah.   we're adventuring    come along with bert and ernie    we're gonna take a little journey    bert and ernie's great adventures    ahh. hawaii is so relaxing, isn't it, ernie.  sure is, buddy bert.  no traffic or noise.  everything seems so far away.  uhoh. everything is far away, ernie.  look how far we've drifted from shore.  first thing we do is.  no. we think.  ah. right. think.  what could we use for a paddle.  my ukulele.  and i'll use my hands.   oh, ernie. we're hardly moving.  look, ernie.  land. land.  we'll be safe and sound here until we get rescued.  i hope it won't take too long.  i could use another pineapple smoothie.  or we could make real oars out of wood from that palm tree and row back.  hey. well, what do you know.  a little crabby is welcoming us.  hi, little crabby.   hey.  oops.  now what.  bert, we've got some thinking to do.  ehh. you're right.  uh, let's see.  what do people who are stranded on a deserted island do to get rescued.   i can hardly hear myself think with that loud buzzing sound.  ernie, it's a plane.  we have to make the pilot see us.  quick. let's write, "s.o.s.," in the sand.  what does s.o.s. mean.  it's the worldwide signal for help.  the pilot was too busy doing tricks to see us.  now what.  don't worry, bert.  i'm sure we'll be rescued soon.   hey. isn't that a ship.  it sure is, ernie.  let's get some palm branches and wave them so the people on the ship will see us.  give me a boost, bert.  oops. ohh.  help. help.  i guess they thought we were just saying hi.  maybe we'd better start building a shelter for us to sleep under.  let's look for driftwood, ernie.  this will be fun, buddy bert, just like camping.  oh, look. it's that little crab again.  how what are you doing.  ernie, i think he's trying to help us.  he dug up a bottle. so.  you know what people do with bottles on deserted islands.  uhuh.  they put a note inside asking for help and throw it in the ocean.  then someone finds it, and they come and rescue us.  brilliant idea, bert.  but what can we write on, bark, seaweed, and what can we write with, mud.  how about a postcard and a pen.  i was gonna write to rubber duckie today.  bert and " here. toss it as far as you can.  i'll keep gathering driftwood.  ok.  ernie, i meant toss it in the ocean, not at my head.  ok. let's try again.  ugh. ernie.  it wasn't me, bert, honest.  look. a dolphin.  could it bei think she's playing catch with it.  let's see if she'll do it again.   she plays fetch just like a sea doggy.  well, stop goofing around, ernie, or that bottle will never reach anyone, and we'll never be rescued.  ok.  she'll swim toward it anywhere i throw it.  i think we just found the way to get back, ernie.  yeah.  thanks, little crabby. aloha.  ready, ernie. toss away.  dolphin ahoy.  ah ah ah. heh heh heh.    good night, bert.  good night, ernie.  uhoh.   it's almost time for elmo's world, but first, let's play sounds of the street.  come on. let's do

strange mix of sounds.  rawwr. chh.  i wonder what that sound is.  rawwr. chh.  a tiger with allergies.  that was one weird sound, and i loved it.  now let's get ready because elmo's world is on the way.  breaker, breaker, good buddy.  got your ears on.  good buddy, uhoh.  hello, there.  it is i your old pal grover.  did you know that all of us have a heart.  it is true, and it is right here inside of our chests.  mmhmm. and did you know our hearts beat.  well, they do.  they go thumpthump, thumpthump, thumpthump.  i love the sound of a heartbeat.  i heart heartbeats. ah ha ha.  would you like to hear my cute, little heart go thumpthump, thumpthump, thumpthump.  then let us use this fancy, little heartlistening thingy, also known in some parts as a stethoscope.  now let's listen.  ooh. this is cold. ha ha ha.   hear that.  is it not beating nice and slow.  ahh. my cute, little heart sounds very relaxed.   oh. look. it is a chicken.  let us listen to her cute, little heartbeat.  here, chickie, chickie, chickie.   come back here.   why are you running, chicken.   i'm running to make my heart beat faster.  bawk bawk bawk.  what are you talking about, chicken.  you cannot control how fast your heart beats.  bawk bawk bawk.  running is exercise, and when you exercise, you make your heart beat faster.  bawk bawk bawk.  get out of town.   don't believe me.  go on and have a listen.  really. yep.   oh. do you hear that.  my heart is beating faster.  when you exercise, you not only make your muscles stronger.  you also make your heart stronger.  uhoh. my heartbeat is slowing down again.  well, then exercise and get that heart pumping faster.  good idea, chicken.   well, what are you waiting for.  move your body and get that heart beating fast.  it is working.   my heart is beating faster.   i feel healthy.  baaawk.   ohh.  getting your heart to beat fast is healthy.  falling while you do it, not so much.  bawk bawk bawk.  ohh. ohh.  hey, nithan. tell them

seahorses.  seahorses look like little horses' heads, and they're fish, too.  i saw fishes of every color from africa and south america.  clownfish, lionfish, piranhas, all kinds of fish.  some fishes look alike and always swim together.  that's called a school of fish.  and then we saw some rays.  we got to touch them.  they felt soft, and i got to feed them.  i wasn't scared.  a sea lion isn't a fish, but it lives in the sea.  boy, can they swim.  an octopus isn't a fish either, but it lives in the sea, too.  we saw fishes from all over the world, and they were awesome.  wow. fishes are all
