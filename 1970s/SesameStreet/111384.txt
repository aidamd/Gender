service, ma'am.  oh. thank goodness.  i just had my hair done, and now i've got a big problem.  wait. do not tell me.  you wanted to be a brunette instead of a blond.  uh, no.  unhappy with your highlights.  no.  the problem is i can't get down from here.  you see, i'm a cow, and cows can't walk down stairs.  that is no problem.  if you cannot walk down, then do what we superheroes do.  oh. what's that.  we dance down. hit it.   oh. oh.   follow me.  ohh.  this way.   ok. stop, stop, stop.  what, what, what, what.  is something wrong, my little dairy queen.  cows can't dance either.  you are a heifer, not a hoofer, but no worries, for i will find a solution to your problem.  stand back as i unleash my power of observation.  mmhmm. mmhmm.mmhmm. mmhmm.  i see that you are up thereand you want to get down there, but these stairsare in the way. hmm.  so the question is how do we get a cow down without using the stairs.  that's the question, super grover.  it is time to unleash the power of investigation.  oh. what are you gonna do.  i'm gonna get rid of the stairs.  well, how.  by using my super staireradicating handchop.  hyah.  ow.  i am now observing that these stairs are very hard.  oh. oh, my poor hand.  oh, no. how will i ever get down from here.  if i cannot get rid of thesestairs, perhaps you can jump over the stairs.  but the ground,it's so hard.  i'll ruin my pedicure.  do not despair, my bovine beauty, for it is time unleash the power of technology.   and voila.  a trampoline.  something soft and springy for you to land on.  now jump over the stairs.  ok. here goes.  ohh.  whoa.  well, that was a quite a milk shake.  oh, no. i'm right back where i started.  this is hopeless.  0 do not know the meaning of the word hopeless.  what does it mean.  it means there's no hope.  i'll never get down.  nonsense. we must not give up ever.  let me just take a closer look at these stairs.  mmhmm. mmhmm.  with my super vision i observe these stairs are very bumpy.  that's the problem.  i don't do bumps.  then we must debumpify these stairs.  let me just check my utility sock.  mmhmm. ahh.  luckily i have brought my super stair debumpifier.  you mean that board.  it is perfectly smooth and straight, not a bump on it.  just put one dainty hoof in front of the other.  i'll try.  you will be home on the range in no time.   oh, no. i still can'tget down from here.  and you e heavierthan i thought.  back up. back up,back up, back up.  aah.  ohh. ohh.  i think you just madea ramp, super grover.  a what.  it's a slopingsurface that goes from high to low.  oh. i think i cango down the ramp.  really.  well, let me give it a try.   it's working. i'mwalking down the ramp.  oh, thank you, super grover.  ooch.  do not mention it.  ohh. ow.  and so our superhero learned that you can use a ramp instead of going down stairs.  watch it.  talk about learning the hard way.  elmo's world is almost here, but first, it's time to play sounds of the street.
