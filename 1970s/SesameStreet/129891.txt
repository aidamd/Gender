problem.  let's twinkle think.  twinkle think, twinkle think, twinkle think.  i got it. ohh.  the alphabet has letters.  maybe the answer is a letter.  let's think this through.  one line down and one line across.  ttt, ttt tickle, ttt, ttt tie.  "t" begins the words tickle and tie and toss.  the answer has to be the letter "t".  yeah.  right you are, and "t" also begins ticket, and that answer is your ticket to trolliamsberg.  whoohoo. yay.   eee. eep.  eee. ha ha.  whoa, whoa, whoa.  no flash photography.  eep eep.  blogg, why did you say your wings aren't wings.  no reason.  come one, come all.  estimate how many trolls it takes to make an ear wax candle.  heh heh heh.  estimate.  it's a thoughtful guess.  aw. i can't guess something like that.  ask blogg. he's a troll.  he'll know.  whoa. a troll with wings.  wings. no. these aren't wings.  they're, umooh. it's a backpack.  hee hee.  see. nothing out of the ordinary here.  no, siree.  looks like blogg isn't in an estimating mood.  anyone else care to take a guess.  ok. i'll give it a shot.  the candle holder's kind of big, and trolls have kind of big ears with quite a lot of ear wax, so i'll guess 6.  and i estimatehmm3.  now let's find out how many trolls it takes to make an ear wax candle.  whoa, whoa, whoa.  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  6.  whoa. 6 trolls it is.  you estimated right, gonnigan.  oh.  and you win the candle.  ohh.  eep eep.  aah.  ehh. no flash photography.  eep eep eep.  garfunkel the griffinnext show in 5 minutes.  holy parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme.  we're going to see garfunkel.  whoohoo. come on, blogg.  let me slip into something more comfortable first.  ooh. cozy.  ahh.  ladies and gentlemen, the art of garfunkel.  ooh.   ohh.   ohh.   don't panic, everyone.  a troll just needs to whisper the words "nap time" in his ear, and all we will hear are the sounds of silence from garfunkel.  ahem. nap time.   nap time.   whispering from down here is not doing the job.  maybe i can solve this problem.  nap time.   sorry, little fairy liebchen, but it has to be a troll who whispers the words.  blogg, is there anyone you know who might be able to help in a situation like this.  but they'll see my wings.  they'll see that i'm different.  sometimes, differences make the difference.  huh. aah.   you can do it, blogg. you're the troll.  and the fairy.   nap time.    wow. look at those wings.  you're the coolest guy i've ever seen.  let's hear it for the troll with the wings.  yay.  boy, i love being a troll, and i love being a fairy.  eep eep.  ooh.  no flash photography.   there are times we choose to wear our shoes    feet need to be protected    but when it's safe to go without    here's something unexpected    those little piggies on your feet    they love to wiggle free    exploring nature skin to earth    footloose and fancy whee, whee, whee, whee    all the way home    set your piggies free    set your piggies free    it's time to lose those socks and shoes    and set your piggies free    set your piggies free    exploring naturally    the greatest way to do it is to really get into it    and set your piggies free    take off your shoe    feel the morning dew    let the cool breeze blow    in between each toe    make a barefoot stand    in the soft warm sand    and don't forget    to let your feet get wet   watch out, little piggies.  that water's cold.   so set your piggies free  )
