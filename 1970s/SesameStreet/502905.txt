bert.  that looks like a driedup stick.  exactly.  our wheat is not growing because it needs rain.  without it, nothing will grow.   oh, sorry, margot, but there's no wheat because we've had no rain.   boy, ernie, wouldn't it be great if that little cloud could give us some rain.  why, bert, that's a great idea.  yoohoo, little cloud.  ernie, what are you doing.  i'm gonna ask that little cloud to rain a little.  ernie, you can't talk to clouds.  you never know till you try, bert.  excuse me, little cloud.  uh, are you talking to me.  we were wondering if you'd mind sending some rain down our way.  rain, but i thought people didn't like rain.  they say it ruins picnics and ball games.  on the contrary.  people need rain, especially farmers like us.  rain makes plants grow, and when plants grow, we have food to eat.  oh, really.  well, then watch this.  i can be a wonderful rain cloud.   ahh. oh.  now you've got all the rain you need.    hey, thanks, little cloud.  oh, anything for a

house.  ohh. i warned you, bert.  now you made little cloud feel sad.  i didn't mean to make you cry.  cry. i wasn't crying.  that was just the last of my rain, and you didn't make me feel sad because
