right, grampy bear.  you better believe it, baby.   oh. what's that sound.  oh. it's my cellular telephone.  it's been beeping like that all morning.  well, why don't you just turn it off.  i would if i knew how.  let me see that thing here.  get that in there.  it's your calendar notification function.  ha ha ha.  aha. thank you, baby.  you are so smart.  aw.   oop. there that phone goes again.  naw. that's my mp2 music playing gizmo.  battery's dying.  i got it, grampy.  let's see here.   you know, why do you have all this technology if you don't know to use it.  your grandmother buys it for me.  she loves her gadgets.  always on the interweb, textmailing to the faceplace or something.  hmm. yeah. she is a very hip grandma.  me, i'm used to the old ways.  things were a lot simpler when i was your age.  will you tell us about it, grampy bear.  elmo, he tells the best stories about the olden days.  yeah. oh, no, no, no.  i don't want to bore you.  no, no, no, no. come on.  please, please, please, please.  well, uh, the time, long before you were born.  the place, a little neck of the woods i like to call home.  as a young bear, i spent my days living the simple life.  we didn't have all this technology.  back then, the only kinds of apples and blackberries around were kinds you ate.  well, then how did you keep in touch with your friends.  we would just call them.  you mean, like on a cell phone, video chat, land line, i.m., text, what.  no. i mean, call them.  harold, come out and play.  ok.  ha ha ha.  so when you played together, what kind of gaming systems did you use, like, console, handheld, online.  heh heh. we didn't have video games.  we didn't have any of the gadgets or gizmos like you have today.  back then, the most hightech toy we ever played with was a cup and a string telephone.  what's that.  just a couple of cups connected by a long string, but you could actually hear each other.  it was pretty cutting edge at the time.  yes, i can.  say something else.  heh heh heh.  yes, sir. life was very different.  gee, grampy bear.  i got to tell you, i can't imagine growing up without computers and video games and stuff like that, but, you know, that cup and the string thing, that sounds pretty cool.  well, if you like, i could teach you to make one, baby.  really. mmhmm.  that would be great.  you see, elmo, this is why i love this guy.  i can learn so much from him.  come on, baby.  ok.  bye.  aw.  all rightie.  hey, buddy. how's it going.  oh, ok, but seeing everyone with their grandparents makes elmo miss his grandma and grandpa even more.  oh. well, you know what.  maybe we could fill in and pretend to be your grandparents today.  hey, hey, yeah.  we could be your substitute grandparents, huh.  really.  of course, buddy. yeah.  come on, come on, come on, come on.  come on, come on.  hey.  boy, elmo's good.  oh, come on out, grandparents.  um, hey, elmo.  when i said we would be your substitute grandparents, i didn't think we would have to dress up like them.  but alan kind of looks like elmo's grandpa.  look. see, see, see.  oh, yeah, yeah, i do.  hey. i'm liking the beard.  it's very sophisticated.  it is. heh heh.  oh. now where's elmo's substitute grandma.  come on out, chris.  i'd rather not.  oh, come on. please, chris.  ugh.  aw, yeah.  do i really have to wear all this.  hey. come on. if it makes him feel better.  ugh. all right, all right, all right.  well, chris kind oflooks like elmo's grandma.  ok.  but his voice isa little too low.  could chris talka little higher.  ..   like this.  higher.   like this.  higher.   i don't think i can go any higher than this.  heh heh heh.  oh, alan, alan.  that's not the wayelmo's grandpa laughs.  it's much lower.  ..   heh heh heh.  uh, lower.   heh heh heh.  lower.   ha ha ha ha.  not so easy, is it. mmhmm.  aw. this isn't working.  no matter how much chris and alan try, they're not really elmo's grandparents.  no, we're not, and, you know, we don't want to take their place.  we just wanted you to feel included in the grandparents celebration.  well, thanks anyway, but it just isn't the same without grandma and grandpa.  maybe elmo should just go home.  oh, no, no. hey, elmo.  there are still so many nice people here for you to meet.  elmo, elmo. hi, rosita.  .ay, mama.  uh, anyway, you haven't met my abuela yet.  come on.  ohh.
