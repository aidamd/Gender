feathers.  and in the nest, the mother duck lays her eggs.  she's very safe, because she builds her nest in the courtyard.  nothing can come in and bother her.  she sits on the eggs for 4 weeks.  until they hatch.  peep.  peep, peep.  peep.  the ducklings were very cute after they were born.  but the little ones can't fly out.  and she can't carry them out.  so we have to help them out of the

looking at his eyebrows.  the eyebrows are right above the eyes.  bert really just has 1 long eyebrow, doesn't he.  the pigeons of pisa eat italian bread crumbs.  huh.  i guess that makes sense, yeah.

alone, bert.  yes, it will, ernie.  uhhuh. watch his eyebrows.  i'm just going to leave you alone.  where was i.  and now bert is happy once again.  it's all in the eyes, elmo, or the eyebrows.  oh, this is great.  byebye.  hee hee. thanks, computer.  boy, ernie and bert sure are good friends.  elmo's good friend elizabeth went to the eye doctor to get her eyes checked, and she told elmo all about it.  that's an eye doctor.  i had to get my eyes checked before i started school.  we played a game.  the doctor showed to me pictures on a computer that i had to match with the pictures on the chart.  telephone.  hand.  duck bird. hee hee.  then she held the pictures in front of me.  and i told her what i saw.  cake.  then the doctor moved a little puppet in front of me, and i followed it with my eyes.  then she used something called a retinascope to look in my eyes.  it has a bright light.  the doctor wanted to make sure that i could see colors.  so i had to find the colored shapes in a book.  circle, square.  after that, she used a different light to look into my eyes to make sure they're growing ok.  then she put drops in my eyes.  .  wow.  the drops made my pupils bigger so she could look all the way at the back of my eyes.  then the eye exam was over.  but the doctor said i needed glasses to see better.  i got to pick out my own eyeglass frame.  i picked some really nice ones.  i like my new glasses.  so does my mom and my friends.  elmo loves elizabeth's glasses, too.  now elmo wants to learn even more about eyes, don't you.  how could we find out even more.  oh. oh.
