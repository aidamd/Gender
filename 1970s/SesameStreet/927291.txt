wants to know. don't you.  let's find out. here, little drawer.  here, little drawer. come on, drawer.  come on. you can do it.  ..ok, ok. now, open up, drawer.  open upaah.  can a chair be a pet. no.  but pets sometimes like to sit on a chair.  my cat does.  can lettuce be a pet. no.  but some pets like to eat lettuce, like rabbits.   can a tiger be a pet. no.  tigers can't live in a house.  they're wild.  can a monster be a pet. no.  hi, telly.  but a monster can have a pet. look.  there's telly's pet hamster chuckie sue.  say hello, chuckie sue.  hi, little chuckie sue.  thanks, drawer.  boy, elmo's a monster, too.  and elmo has a pet he loves very much.  come with elmo.  dorothy.  right, dorothy.  hello, dorothy. ha ha ha.  elmo's friend alisa has 2 pets, and she told elmo about it.  watch this, dorothy. watch this.  my cat's name is fluffy.  and my dog's name is spike.  cats and dogs are different in a lot of ways.  but my dog has short, shiny hair.  and my cat fluffy has long, fluffy hair.  all pets have to eat. that's the same.  but dogs eat dog food, and cats eat cat food.   they both drink water.  that's something that's the same about them.  fluffy keeps himself pretty clean, but i have to give spike a bath to keep him clean.  my sister has to help me.  he doesn't like his bath too much, but he likes when it's over.  both my pets like to be petted.  my dog likes it most when i rub his tummy.  but my cat loves it when i scratch his ears.  all pets need exercise.  fluffy can be a little lazy about his exercise.  but spike likes to get his exercise with me.  he really loves it.  my dog wags his tail when he's happy.  and when my cat is happy, he purrs.  when you have a pet you take care of them and love them.  i love both my pets, and they love me.  and that's the same.  that's right.  just like elmo loves dorothy and dorothy loves elmo.   ohhh.  but elmo really wants to know more about pets. don't you.  ..  oh, yeah.  elmo can watch the pet channel
