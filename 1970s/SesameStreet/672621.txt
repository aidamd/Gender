alan.  yeah. are you enjoying it.  very crunchy.  guys. hey, leela.  nice. yeah.  oh. hey. welcome to sesame street.  hi. hi.  hola. ha ha ha.  hey. where's that noise coming from.  i don't know.  it's a helicopter.  oh, look. look.  somebody's coming down on a rope.  wow.  brrrreeeheeha.  cacaw. cacaw. cacaw. caw.  well, here i am.  i've been dropped out here in the middle of nowhere with only the clothes on my back to see if i can survive out here in the wilds of nature.  who are you.  yeah.  i am wild nature survivor guy.  ooh.  relying only on my instincts, i'll see if i have what it takes to make it out here in the middle of nature completely alone.  well, you're not completely alone.  i mean, we're all here, too.  also, this isn't exactly the middle of nature.  this is the middle of the city.  i know nature when i see it.  after all, i am wild nature survivor guy.  there's nature all around us.  really. si, verdad.  so i must find food, water, and shelter fast if i'm going to have any chance of making it out here all alone.  except for us.  wow. this is so exciting.  yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  wild nature survivor guy must survive on his own, but you can watch and learn.  gracias.  si. day one, hunger is setting in fast.  i must find something to eat.  there's food out here in the wild if you know where to look for it.  whoa.   aha. i've picked up the scent.  if i'm gonna catch some food, i'm gonna have to rely on my quick reflexes.  yes. ha ha ha. food at last.  i was growing that tomato.  ..  when you're out in nature, you have to do whatever it takes to survive.  yeah, but you're not out in nature.  well, then what is this tomato plant if not a part of nature.  well, i guess it is, buthey. yeah, yeah, yeah.  plants are part of nature.  that's right. there is nature here.  this food has given me the nourishment my body craved.  now i feel like i can go on, but for how much longer.  all i'm saying is that if you wanted a tomato, you just had to ask.  well, when you're out in the wild, you must act fast, for who knows where or when i might find food again.  actually, i have a lot of food right over there at my store.  and where did those fruits and vegetables come from.  where.  from nature, from a plant just like this.  all of our food comes from nature.  oh, wow. really.  si, verdad.  you see, nature provides, nature gives us what we need.  wow.  well, what i need to do right now is to take the rest of my tomatoes home.  all right.  see you later, leela.  well, i'd managed to find food, but i won't make it out here without water.  soon, thirst will set in, and i've been without water out in the wilds of nature for who knows how long.  actually, it's only been a few minutes.  nevertheless, i must find some, for water is key to survival.  but where can wild nature survivor guy find water.  i'll rely on nature once again.  what do you mean exactly.  nature gives us water.  it simply falls from the sky in the form of rain.  all i have to do is drink it in.  iit's not raining.  no. that's a bit of a problem.  it's too bad you were not here when it rained this morning.  it rained here this morning.  yeah, yeah. si, si.  then that meansaha. yes.  there are still drops of water on these leaves.  but that's enough to drink.  it is if i put all the drops together.  i'll just collect all the drops in my canteen.  here comes the water drop by precious drop.  cool. que bien.  slowgoing working.  this could take a while.  you know, if you get thirsty, i have some water right here.  where do you think that water came from.  oh. from the faucet.  before that. it came from rain.  it did. si, verdad.  si. we get our water from rain.  once again, nature provides.  wow. nature is so amazing.  it sure is, yeah.  i only wish it has provided a little bit more water for me right here, but i can do this later.  right now, i have to prepare for nightfall.  night. but it's stillit's still afternoon.  right, right, but night comes quickly this time of year, and it can get very cold out here in the wilds of nature, up to 200 degrees below zero.  i don't think that's right.  i must look for ways to keep warm.  an experienced survivor guy like myself knows that nature will give me everything i need.  how can nature keep him warm.  elmo doesn't know, but elmo can't wait to find out.  aha. an incredible find.  and another one.  yes. these are perfect to keep my warm.  feathers.  how can those little feathers keep you warm, huh. yeah.  feathers are nature's perfect warmers.  they keep birds warm, so they keep me warm, too.  i just stick them inside my shirt andha ha ha.  actually, feathers, they're tickly.  they're nature's perfect tickler.  if you get cold, i'll let you borrow a coat, or you can eveni'll even lend you this vest.  and what do you think is inside this vest making it warm.  feathers. this vest is stuffed with feathers.  no way. si, verdad.  you see, nature provides, but i'm gonna need a lot more feathers to keep me warm out there in the wild at night.  i'm not sure nature's gonna provide you with that many feathers.   get in my shirt, please.  you got to keep me warm.  ha ha ha.  you're too tickly.  it's too tickly.  oh, my goodness.  it's too tickly.   i don't think that kind of nature wanted to keep you warm.  sometimes, nature doesn't cooperate, but look.  the sun is getting lower in the sky.  night will fall soon.  i must start to build myself a shelter.  wait, wait, wait, wait.  what's a shelter.  a place where i can sleep, where i can stay warm and dry and protected from the elements.  i must act quickly.   quicker than that.   that's pretty good.  aha.  ahahaha.  why is he ahaing.  mmmmmm.  this is exactly what i need to build my shelter.  what, a couple of branches.  yes. now all i need is the right spot.  here. hold these.  whoa, whoa, whoa.  what are we supposed to do with these, wild nature survivor guy.  hello.  where did he go.  ahhahahaha.  come on.  elmo will help.  i'm coming.  have a look at this.  it's the biggest nest i've ever seen, and it seems to be abandoned.  there's no birds that are living in it right now.  actually, thatthis is perfect for my shelter.  it's high off the ground, so i'll keep dry in case the flood waters rise.  flood waters.  i'll take those.  those branches will make the perfect covering.  what are you doing.  look at him.  wow. that looks cool.  listen. this cannot be your shelter.  trees and branches make a great shelter and not just for people.  lots of animals and insects use trees for their shelter.  that's true, alan.  i mean, you can't stay here tonight.  oh. i know what you're going to say.  why don't i just stay at your house tonight.  yeah. i wasn't gonna say that.  that's very nice, but what do you think some of the houses are made of, hmm.  oh. me. me, me. wood.  si. whoohoo.  and where does wood come from.  from trees. trees, trees, trees.  exactly. now you see, nature provides.  elmo never knew nature gave us so much.  nature is everywhere, even here in the city.  well, my shelter's not complete, so i will climb in and get ready for the long night ahead.  no, no, no, no.  see, this can't be your shelter because somebody already lives in this nest.   la la la   oh. visitors.  my goodness.  i've just come face to face with the biggest wild bird i've ever seen.  big bird's not wild at all.  he lives here on sesame street, and he's very friendly.  oh. thanks, rosita.  it's magnificent, one of nature's greatest masterpieces.  ha ha ha.  no. big bird's not a part of nature.  of course he is.  i am.  we all are.  what do you mean.  we're all a part of nature.  we eat and breathe and drink and live because of nature.  so i guess you could say that in a way we're all wild nature survivor guys.  no. that's my thing. sorry.  but, you see, that's why we must take care of nature because it's so important to our survival.  we need nature for our food, our water, our everything.   listen. do you hear that.  nature's singing to us.  that sounds like a cricket to me.  aha. yes.  i think nature wants us to sing along.  it does.   nature here and there    nature everywhere    nature's everywhere    in everything you see    we're a part of nature    and it's part of you and me   everybody sing.   nature here and there    nature everywhere    it's true we all need nature    but nature needs us, too    if we take care of nature    it takes care of me and you   well, i think i've proven that nature has given me, wild nature survivor guy, everything i need to survive out here in the middle of nowhere all by myself.  we're still here.  yeah. hello.   nature   i'm debra, and i'm here to tell you all about the word nature.  now the word nature means things found outside that are not made by people, and i'd love to show you some nature right now, but unfortunately, i don't see anything from nature around here.  i'm part of nature.  hey. yeah.  a frog is an animal,and animals are found outside.  that's right.  and animals are notcreated by people.  no, they are not.  so animals arepart of nature.  nature.  what else is part of nature.  oh, oh, oh. me, me.  i'm a part of nature.  oh, that's true, too.  plants are found outsideand are not made by people, so plants are definitelypart of nature.  nature.  can you think of anythingelse that's part of nature.  i think i'm part of nature.  is a rock part of nature.  well, let's think.  do we find rocks outside.  yeah.yeah.  and are rocksmade by people.  uhuh.no.  so, yes,

bunions to catch them.  ..maybe spot was trying to tell us that you don't need magic dancing shoes to dance.  all you need to dance is your own feet.  yeah, but my feet can't dance, not unless i get those shoes.  come back here, shoes.  oh. where are those shoes now.   they are on top, on top, on top   on top. on top of what.  oh. on top of the bookshelf.  oh. ah. ew, ew, ew.  there's sticky clay on my head.  get it off, get it off.  aw. those shoes will never teach me to dance.  that's because you don't need them.  you already danced. huh.  remember what you did when the shoes made you send niblet flying into the air and then he fell down your shirt.  it tickled, so i sort of went wiggle, wiggle, wiggle.  and do you remember what you did when the shoes made you slip on that banana peel.  it was really slippery, and it made me go slip and slide, slip and slide.  and what about just now when the shoes made that goop fall on your head.  well, it felt all goopy, and i wanted to get it off, so i went shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake.  but what does that all have to do with me learning to dance.  put those 3 moves together to the music.  you mean, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, slip and slide, slip and slide, and the shake, shake, shake.  oh. ha ha. i can feel it.  wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, slip and slide, slip and slide, shake, shake, shake.  ha ha. i'm dancing.  whoa, gonnigan.  that is one cool dance step.  can you please teach it to me.  can you please teach it to me.  there's nothing to it.  wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, slip and slide, slip and slide, shake, shake, shake. hooray.  looks like we're ready for showtime.    wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, slip and slide, slip and slide, shake, shake, shake.  yeah.  whoohoo.  great job. give me some shoe.  too much shoe, too much shoe.  ahh. ok.  who wants to do the forward backward dance with me.  oh, me. me, me.  all right. all right.  now, this is a line dance, so everyone find a place on the line.  y, you, too, can dance along.   i got a notion to do some forward backward motion    just follow my feet    and you'll get the forward backward beat    step forward, step forward, step forward, step forward    now let's do the reverse    there's no need to rehearse    step backward, step backward, step backward, step backward    now that you've got the knack    let's try it to the back    step backward, step backward, step backward, step backward    you know which way to move    so let's give it some groove    yeah, step forward, step forward    step forward, step forward    we're back on the line    we're dancing just so fine   now let's take 2 steps forward, 1 step backward.  2 steps forward, 1 step backward.  you, too. step or just groove to the music.   step forward, step forward, step backward    step forward, step forward, step backward    step forward, step forward, step backward   now, what would happen if we switch and take 2 steps backward and 1 step forward.  we'll be right back on the line again.  let's find out. come on.   step backward, step backward, step forward    step backward, step backward, step forward    step backward, step backward, step forward   hey, we're back on the line again.     we've had a revelation    with the forward backward combination   hey, now let's try forward, backward, forward, backward.  try to keep up.   step forward, step backward, step forward, step backward    step forward, step backward, step forward, step backward    step backward, step forward, step backward, step forward    step backward, step forward, step backward, step forward   enough.   i had a notion to do some forward backward motion    our dance is through, follow me    i know just what to do   ha ha ha. ha ha ha.  are you ready to follow a little lamb to school.  because murray

 she helped her mom bake cookies, and she told elmo all about it.  i helped my mom make oatmeal cookies for the children at our neighborhood nursery school.  first, we added the ingredients.  i helped my mom put in the flour and the oatmeal.  brown sugar, melted butter, cinnamon, and milk.  my mom added an egg.  you have to be careful not to get any eggshell in the bowl.  then i helped mix.  and i helped put the dough on the cookie sheet.  it's not easy because it's real sticky, but we made a lot of cookies.  then my mom put them in the oven to bake.  the oven's really hot, and when they were done, we had to let them cool.  they looked really good, and they smelled good.  then i helped my mom put them in a box.  and we took them to the children at the nursery school for their snack time.  they really liked our cookies.  and the teacher thanked us for helping.  i like helping, and i like sharing.  wow. you were a great help.  elmo wants to learn more about helping, don't you.  how we
