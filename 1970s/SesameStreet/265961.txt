go.  shove me in.  there mr. hubert thehuman cannonball goes.  drumroll, please.   and someone pleasepress the launch button.  i'll do it, i'lldo it, i'll do it.  ready.  uh, unh.   oh. how far did i get.  i'll measure.  let's see here.  ..  0 feet.  .  that's none. i got nowhere.  what happened.  you broke my cannon.   no. no. come on.  i just pressed the buttonlike you told me to.  oh, no. what am i gonna do.  without a cannon, i'll neverbe launched precisely 5 feet across sesame street intoa bucket of blue gelatin.   i've let the audience down.  oh, no. you can't letthe audience down.  telly, you know theaudience is not even real.  that doesn't matter.  hubert is ahuman cannonball, and a human cannonball has tofly and fly free.  otherwise, i'd just behubert the human paperweight.  we can't let that happen.  we have to help hubert.  we have tofigure out a way to launch hubert precisely 5 feetacross sesame street and into a bucket of blue gelatin.  but how canlaunch mr. hubert.  well, i guess we just haveto find something else that can launch somethinginto the air.  ooh, ooh. i know something.  i know something.  the crowd is very excited.   yeah, yeah. i can tell.   whoa.  make way, make way, folks.  make way. coming through.  coming through.  hey, uh, what doyou have there, telly.  that's sir telly to you.  this is my catapult fromwhen i play knights of the triangular table.  yeah, but do you think thatwill work with hubert the human cannonball.  there's only oneway to find out.  load me onto the catapult.  drumroll, please.   just put me in the basket.  now launch me.  yoww. oof.  how far did i go.  i'll measure the distance.  ..  2. 2 feet.  2 feet.  oh, that's not far enough.  i need to go further.  sir telly, can you makeme go further.  oh, i don't think so.  ohh, i'll never be launchedprecisely 5 feet across sesame street and into abucket of blue gelatin.   oh, no. listento the audience.  we have to thinkof something else.  elmoknows something that may launch mr. hubert.  be right back.  elmo's got an idea.   over here, mr. wolf.  coming through,everybody, coming through.  ok. let's move thisthing out of here.  move it out, move it out.  wait, wait, wait, waita minute, wait a minute.  a wolf.no. that's crazy.  how's a wolf supposedto make things fly.  well, chris, not justany wolf, the big bad wolf.  oh, he can make houses fly.  my secret is wind.  will it work.  can the big bad wolf launchhubert the human cannonball precisely 5 feet into abucket of blue gelatin.  let's give it a try.  drumroll.   and launch me.  blow.  blow harder.  whoa.  ooh.  how far did i get.  measuring.  ..  ..  and looks like,uh, 3. 3 feet.  3 feet.  unh.  now i'll never get tofly precisely 5 feet across sesame street into abucket of blue gelatin.  no offense, wolf.  none taken.  oh, boy. whatare we gonna do.  wait a minute.  i think maybe i canengineer something.  a train can't makeyou fly, baby bear.  no, no, no, no, not atrain engineer, telly.  i'm talking aboutengineering engineer.  but what's engineering.  engineering is when youdesign and build something.  precisely, and i am going toengineer something, gentlemen, so forceful it will launchhubert further across sesame street.  whwhwhat are yougonna make, baby bear.  chris, got any rubber bands.  as a matter of fact, i do.  check it out.  mmhmm.  aha. there you go.  ok.help

aaahem.  oh, and chris.  there we go.   lets see if ican engineer up some snacks.  come on. let's go.  oh, boy.  hey. i've got bluegelatin if anybody wants.  hi, everyone. i'm james.  oh, oh. hi. elmo's elmo.  and we're here to tell youabout the word engineer.  yeah. engineer.  now to engineer meansto design and build something, right.  james are going to engineer something right now.  now whatare we engineering, elmo.  oh, well, an automaticspaghetti server.  here you go.  an automaticspaghetti server.  james ever wished that he could serve spaghettiwithout using a big spoon.  you know what. you'reright. i have, i have.  big spoons are a pain.  let's designand build an automatic spaghetti server.  let's engineer.  engineer.  i'm gonna put thisblock of wood right here.  maybe right there. ok.  james, you should put that board on top of that.  ok. this board on top of it.  this one right here.  i can do that.got it.  got it.good.  and i'm gonna put thebowl of spaghetti on this end of the board.  yep. that end.  james should put theempty plate right here.  the empty plate right here.  mmhmm.all right. you got it.  ok. all right. we did it.  we engineered it.  now let's servethe spaghetti.  right. here we go.  engineer.engineer.  ha ha ha.  it's almost time forabby's flying fairy school, but first, checkout that rocket.  i wonder howyou design a rocket.  ooh. .vamos averiguando.  yes. let's find out.   yeah, yeah, want to knowwhat it's all    ask a question,and let's find out   we're here at he new yorkhall of science.  how do you design a rocket.  let's find out.  oh, boy.  today we're gonna do someexperiments to see how we can get a rocket to fly asfar as possible.  everybody here is going towork in a team of 2 or 3 people, and you're gonna usethese materials that you have in front of you to builda rocket, and each of your rockets are gonna be a littlebit different, and we're gonna see how those differencesaffect how the rocket flies.  are you guys ready.  yeah. let's design a rocket.  every team, grab your straw.  so you see a littlepiece of clay.  yeah.yeah.  you're gonna take thatlittle piece of clay, and you're gonna put it on oneend of the straw and make sure the straw is plugged.  ok. we got clay onthe tip of the rocket.  what else do we put on, adiel.  if you look at these littlepieces of paper, these are the fins that you might normallysee on a rocket, placed wherever on the rocket youwant, and we're gonna see how that affects the rocket.  how many are youguys gonna put.  oh, you got 2.ok. there it is.  1, 2 fins on that one.  good.  those are some awesomerockets, but can they fly.  we'll see in a few minutes,but right now, check this out.  we can help you.  "h" is for helping.  i need help, i need help.  i'll help you.  "h" is for helping.  "h" is for helping.  we built the letter "h".  "h" is for helping.  seggy, what's coming up next.  abby's flying fairy school.  oh, boy.    look up high in the sky    it's a school, it can fly    let's all hurry to the flying fairy school    grab your wands   yeeha.   bring your wings  yeah.   we will learn magic things    let's all hurry to the flying fairy school    how to make us grow    and how to make us shrink   whoa.   how to solve a problem with a simple twinkle think    the school is really magic    and magic's really cool    let's go in, let's begin    it's flying fairy school   ha ha ha.  ha ha.  aw. welcome to our class.  we're just about to have lunch.  aw. look at this.  my mommy just packed me a little sandwich.  whoa, ohh.   blogg, that's not little.  it's huge.  well, i'm really hungry, so i wish it was even more huge.  i wish i could just take my wand and go zippity, zappity, munchity, munch.  i want a really humongous lunch.  ouch.  wow.  what in the world.  it's a humongous lunchbox.  and i bet it's filled with huge, delicious food.  let's check it out.  hold on, blogg.  this lunchbox doesn't belong to you.  it belongs to pandora.   oh, by. pandora's lunchbox.  whatever you do, do not open it.  why.  no time to explain.  i must get ahold of pandora right away, and remember, don't open that lunchbox.  what, here.  blogg.  aw, come on, guys.  something gigantically good could be in there.  or something terrible.  whoa, whoa.  whoa.  where's gonnigan.  he's gone again.  aha. now i can open the lunchbox.  noooo.  oh. look.  the box opened a little.  ohh. what's gonna happen now.  eh, you guys are worried about nothing.  uhoh. yow.  whoa. whoa.  eek.  ohh.  ohh.  ohh.  ohh.  hey.  would youwhoa.  well, i got ahold of pandoraoh, dear me.  you opened pandora's lunchbox.  and the food has gone bananas.  err.  how do we get these things back inside, mrs. sparklenose.  i don't know, gonnigan.  perhaps we should investigate the inside of the lunchbox and see if we find any clues.  look. there's some shapes down there.  a rectangle, a circle, and awhat's that other shape.  that is called a hexagon because it has 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 sides.  ..have to do with all this crazy food.  yeah. none of it is shaped like that.  ah, but look closer, fairies.  maybe there's something about the food that matches those shapes.  how.  i think this calls for a twinkle think.  aw, not that again.  just think about that juice box.  ow. ohh, i can't think.  i got juice in my eye.  i wonder whatwould happen if we pulled out that straw.  it's got 2 longsides and 2 short sides.  it's a rectangle.  what are we waiting for.  let's get that straw.  oh.  unh.  serpentine, serpentine.  ohh.  boy, that juice box makes me so mad.  i'd love to knock it over.  blogg, that's a great idea.  maybe if we knock it over the straw will fall out.  let's all get on this sideohand duck.  now push.  unh.  the juice box is now a rectangle.  oh, yeah. we did it. we did it.  wing whack.  great job, fairies.  now let's go see what shapes are left.  well, there's a circle and, uh, what's that strange shape called again.  a hexagon.  because it has 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 sides.  ouch. hey. watch it.  that wrap isn't like either of those shapes.  remember, look closely at the food to find the shape.  we better twinkle think again.  i knew that was coming.  how can we find ashape in this wrap.  oh. i know.  maybe if we unwrap it therewill be shapes hidden inside.  yeah.  then come on. let's unwrap that wrap.  aha. gotcha.  ohh. unh.  eww. yuck.  this wrap is full of beans.  don't worry, abby.  i got it.  it got me.  ohh. ohh. ohh.  i'm getting woozy.  me, too.  how do i stop this thing.  aim it towards the wall.  i'll try.  ..  a circle.  yay. we got another one.  nice work, fairies.  only one shape left.  um, what's that shape called again.  a hexagon.  ..  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 sides.  but these tortilla chips only have 1, 2ohh3 sides.  that means they're triangles, not hexagons.  hmm. let's twinkle think.  ohh. again.  how can we use thesetortilla chips to make a hexagon.  uhuh. that's not a hexagon.  uhuh. that's definitelynot a hexagon.  that's it. 1, 2, 3,4, 5, 6 sides.  a hexagon.  what are we waiting for.  let's grab those chips and make a hexagon.  ugh. there. gotcha.  a hexagon.  yay. we did it.  ha ha.  excellent, class, excellent.    come in.  oh, hi. i'm pandora.  i came to get my lunchbox.  thanks for finding it and watching it for me.  and i'd be happy to share my lunch.  would you like some.  nooooo.  0 is comingsoon, but first let's launch some rockets.  why did you design yourrocket to be like this.  2 fins lookedlike an airplane.  oh. let me see.hold that up.  airplanes fly, right.  wow. i can't wait tosee how far it goes.  launch the green rocket.  how did youdesign your rocket.  we designed with 3 fins.  what do you think, juliana.  why did you guyschoose 3 fins.  because it wouldspin like this.  i like that.  launch the blue rocket.  wow. did you see howfar that went.  we'll launch some more rocketsreally soon, but first, watch this.  and now the adventuresof salty and pierre.  adventure isthe spice of life.  haw haw.  what he said. haw haw.  is it time foranother number safari.  it is said thatsomewhere in this backyard is the number 5.  let's go find it. haw haw.  haw haw.  look. there is a dog house.  maybe the number5 is in there.  i will go insideand find out.  no. i will goinside and find out.  i said i will go inside.  no. me.me.  no. me. me.  no. me.me.  ok. you.  argh.  ohh.  oh. look, pierre. itis the number 5.  haw haw haw.  pierre, this mustbe your lucky day.  you are seeing 1, 2,3, 4, 5 stars.  hoo hoo hoo.salty.  le ruff.  ho ho. i think thedoggy likes you, pierre.  haw haw.  ohh. this isreally for the dogs.  haw haw haw.  what do you think of super grover 2.0.  ha ha ha.  i think it's funny, too.  super grover's coming up next.  he observes.  oh, look.  no. no. aah.  he questions.  hubbawha.  he investigates.  hmm. what does this button do.  aah.  super grover 2.0.  he shows up.  in the peaceful countryside,one lone horse is taking a ride on the road to trouble.  oh. i'm not takinga ride at all.  ..won't...move.  help. help.  have no fear. i amcoming to the rescue.  who said that.  aaaaaah.  unh.  super grover, you showed up.  no. he did not.super grover 2.0 did.  now what seems tobe the problem.  i am trying to take aride in this cart, ..  it won't move.  so the question wemust ask is what will get this cart to move.  yep. that's thequestion all right.  it is time now to unleashthe power of observation, vation, vation, vation.  i will look closely at the cart.  ah.  hmm. observing, observing.  aha.  ahwha.  these look like stickthingies at the front of this cart.  so obviously these stick thingies are some sort of switch to turn the cart on.  switch on.  ohh.  ow. oof.  i think we blew a fuse.  you know, i'm thinking maybesomething's supposed to be in front of this here cart,and maybe those stick thingies are to pull it with.  pull. hmm. somethingto pull itno problem.  be right back.  here you are.  this little worm is just whatyou need to move this cart.  a worm.  precisely. nowgo ahead, wormy.  pull the cart.  come on, come on.  put some muscle into it.  that's it. that's it.  use your backbone.  pull the cart.  something tells me that thatworm doesn't have enough force to pull this cart.  the worm needs 4s.  i know where toget some of those.  ok, little wormy.here are your 4s.  now move the cart. come on.  no. no, no. i'm nottalking about numbers.  force means the strength thatyou use to move something.  we need somethingwith more force.  that meansthat it's time to activate the power of investigation.  be right back.  here we are.  a chicken.yes.  you see, this chickenis bigger than the worm.  ergo, i predict itwill have more force.  go ahead.  use the force, chicken.   chicken, do not eat the worm.  head for the hills, wormy.  i can't believe this.  bawk kaw.  now go, andmay the force be with you.  pull.   well, the cart ismoving a little bit.  yeah, but not very much.  bawk kaw.  what happened.  behold. thechicken laid an egg.  now she must go onmaternity leave.  i guess we need evenmore force than a chicken to pull this cart.  worry not. your problemwill be solved anon.  the force isstrong in this one.  a pig.  the pig is bigger thanthe chicken, so i think the big pig will have more forcethan this little chicken.    chicken, pig.  makes good horse sense.  you are a wriggly one.  there. now pull, pig, pull.  oink oink.  ooooiiiink.  something tells methis pig is oinked out.  oink.  no. we'll never getthis cart to move.  yes, we can.  we just need somethingeven bigger than a pig like a horse.  hey. you are a horse.  well, true, but i was kindof hoping to ride in the cart.  well, then we just needsomething else bigger than a pig to pull the cart.  say, you'rebigger than a pig.  maybe you could pull the cart.  me.  well, i am a force to bereckoned with, i suppose.  i willtry to use my own force to pull it.  excuse me, pig.   all right,super grover 2.0. giddyap.   it's working. it's working.  you do have the forceto pull the cart.  yeehawwww.  and so our superhero haslearned that it takes a lot of force to pull somethingbig and heavy like a cart.  this has been a verymoving experience.  giddyap, super grover.  it's almost time for elmo,but right now, let's launch some more rockets.  patrick andlaurel, let me see.  how did youdesign your rocket.  whoa. that looks pretty good.  how many fins doyou have on that.  4.  we thought that ifthere were 4 fins thatit would go faster.  well, let's see.  will 4 fins go further.  launch the red rocket.  the rocket design with the4 fins went the furthest.  now get ready because elmowill be blasting off soon.   measure, yeah, measure    see, i never thought that i could ever find out    just how big a jumbo shrimp could be    but now i'm sure, and i don't have a doubt    if you want to know the size, i hold the key    just how long or how tall    justin can tell you it all    because he's got the right tool    got a ruler that rules, you see    i will measure, i'll measure    use your own    crustacean measuring is a cinch    get the size    i will measure, i'll measure    this shrimp is 1 foot and 1 inch    measure up, measure up, up, up, up    measure, yeah, measure    i never thought that i would ever tell you    just how much an elephant weighs    but now i hold the secret    and you know it's true    if you want to know the weight    i will amaze    just how heavy or light    justin will get it right    he's not gonna fail    because he's using a scale, you see    i will measure, i'll measure    till the measuring's done    until the measuring's done    he will measure    i will measure, i'll measure    this pachyderm weighs a ton    measure up, measure, measure up, up, up, up    measure, yeah, measure    here we go   sure you got this,   , leave it to elmo    when elmo's in the kitchen    cooking things up    elmo measures with a spoon    elmo measures with a cup    when elmo needs to know the height    of something or the width    elmo measures with some tape    elmo measures with a stick    to see what weighs more, a mouse or a whale    elmo measures with a balance    elmo measures with a scale    the whale weighs more, yes, this is so      elmo measured it, yo    if you ever, you ever    need to find the size or the weight    measure up, measure, measure up, measure up    you can measure, yeah, measure    because measuring this stuff is great    measure up, measure, measure up, measure up    measure, yeah, measure   can i get an elmo.  elmo.  elmo's up next.   la la la la la la    elmo's world    la la la la la la    elmo's world    elmo loves his goldfish    his crayon, too   ooh.  yeah.  ha ha ha.   that's elmo's world   hi. welcome to elmo's world.  oh. elmo's so happy to see you.  ooh. and so is dorothy.  say hello, dorothy.  ha ha ha.  guess what elmo's thinking about today.   ya da da da   aah. what's that.  is that a bird.  is that a plane.  ohh.  oh. it's super grover.  elmo will go help super grover.  here, super grover.  that's what elmo's thinking about todayhelping.  thank you, elmo, but i am the superhero.  i will do the helping.  i am here to help you.  butbut, grover. hmm.  elmo doesn't need any help right now. uhuh.  you don't. no.  uh, you know, thatyou really threw me a curve ball there.  uhbutbut if elmo does need elmo, elmo will call super grover.  you know what.  it is really simple, elmo.  if you need me, just give me a call.  how about that, huh.  up, up, and awayuh, i think you are stuck on my cape, elmo.  sorry, sorry, sorry.  yoww.  elmo will help.   you know, helping.  oh, that smarts. coming, super grover.    aw, look.  dorothy's been thinking about helping, too.  did someone say, "helping".  aah.  oh, boy.  it's super grover again.  elmo will help him.  here you go, super grover.  here you go.  i am here and ready to help, little elmo.  but, gee, elmo still doesn't need any help, super grover.  somebody around here must need

 she helped her mom bake cookies, and she told elmo all about it.  i helped my mom make oatmeal cookies for the children at our neighborhood nursery school.  first, we added the ingredients.  i helped my mom put in the flour and the oatmeal.  brown sugar, melted butter, cinnamon, and milk.  my mom added an egg.  you have to be careful not to get any eggshell in the bowl.  then i helped mix.  and i helped put the dough on the cookie sheet.  it's not easy because it's real sticky, but we made a lot of cookies.  then my mom put them in the oven to bake.  the oven's really hot, and when they were done, we had to let them cool.  they looked really good, and they smelled good.  then i helped my mom put them in a box.  and we took them to the children at the nursery school for their snack time.  they really liked our cookies.  and the teacher thanked us for helping.  i like helping, and i like sharing.  wow. you were a great help.  elmo wants to learn more about helping, don't you.  how we
