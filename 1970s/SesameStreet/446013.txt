things    let's all hurry to the flying fairy school    how to make us grow    and how to make us shrink   whoa.   how to solve a problem with a simple twinkle think    the school is really magic    and magic's really cool    let's go in, let's begin    it's flying fairy school   ha ha ha.  ha ha.  hello. i'm mrs. sparklenose.  welcome to flying fairy school.  today, we're in the art center.  whoa.  be with you in a minute.  i'm glad you're here.  today at flying fairy school, everyone is making mystical, magical macaroni art, so come on.  raise your wand or your finger, and let's get to it.  what kind of mystical, magical macaroni art can i make.  ooh. i know.  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 sides.  oh. it's a macaroni hexagon.  wait. i changed my mind.  oh. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 sides.  it's now a macaroni octagon.  wait. i changed my mind again.  is she gonna make a macaroni pentagon, a macaroni heptagon, a macaroni tetradecagon.  actually, it's a macaroni horsey. ha ha.  what mystical, magical macaroni art are you going to make, gonnigan.  oh. i already made mine.  it's a bowl of macaroni made completely of macaroni.  eep. eep eep. eep.   eep.  hey. don't eat my art.  it brings down the value.  if you want to see some great mystical, magical macaroni art, then check this out.  it's gonna be big.  it's gonna be huge.  it's gonna be humungous.  whoa.  that is humungous.  what is it.  it's a dinosaur made completely of macaroni.  i call it macaronisaurus.  that is totally cool, blogg.  thank you, but it's not done yet.  i need something to bring it to life.  try glitter glue.  if you ask me, a little glitter glue always adds just the right amount of sparkle.  i was thinking of something a little more spicy.  what. like paprika.  no. this.  ooh.  the spice of life.  but if you put the spice of life on the humungous macaronisaurus, it will come alive.  well, what good is a macaronisaurus if you can't play with it.  if you make a macaronisaurus move from bottom to top, you'd better know how to make the macaronisaurus stop.  don't worry. i got it all under control.  now it's time to spice things up.  oh. i can't watch.  aw. it didn't work.  maybe the spice of life has passed its expiration date.   or maybe not. aah.  come on, macaronisaurus.  let's play some checkers.   maybe he's more of a chess person.  looks like he wants to play dressup.  ok by me.  we'll put on some tutus.   oh, what are we gonna do.  aah. ohh.  don't worry. i'll handle this.   come here, macaronisaurus.  that did not go as well as i hoped.  oh, no. we got to make it stop.  you have to use your noodles to figure this out.  using noodles is what got us into this mess in the first place.  not macaroni noodles, these kinds of noodles.  oh. right.  let's twinkle think.  what makes things stop.  twinkle think, twinkle think, twinkle think.  i know.  dead batteries.  bicycle brakes.  a dancing kumquat wearing a polkadotted mumu.  huh.  that would make me stop.  how about a stop sign.  yeah. stop signs make people stop.  let's try a stop sign.  i'll head down to the department of transportation and see if they have any extras lying around.  wait, gonnigan.  we can just make a stop sign.  we need 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 pieces of ..  but that's just an octagon, not a stop sign.  it's the right shape, but there's something missing.  what is it.  this is never going to work.  we might as well just stop.  that's it. we need the word stop.  stop. stop.  stop.   it didn't work.  the macaronisaurus went right through the stop sign.  that's against the law.  eep eep.   eeeeep.  looks like niblet's gonna give him a ticket.  whatever he's doing, it's working.  that little gerbilcorn is stopping that humungous macaronisaurus.  eep eep eep.  hmm.   oh, no. it didn't work.  the flying fairy school is doomed.  take it easy, gonnigan.  keep thinking.  you just need to spot the solution.  that's it. spot.  we need spot's help.  here spot, here, boy.   now we need to find a way to solve the problem and stop a humungous macaroni dinosaur.  fetch, spot, fetch.   ha ha ha.  humungous.  humungous.  humungous.  humungous.  humungous.  we already know the macaronisaurus is humungous.  tell us something we don't know.  wait a minute.  maybe what spot is saying is that we need something humungous to stop something humungous.  now that's a humungous idea.  but what humungous thing do we need.  how about a humungous fence.   ha ha ha.  no, no. a humungous brick wall.   uh, uh, uh, a humungous meatball.  .  mama mia.  that's a humungousa meatball.  let's give it a try.  come on, guys. let's push that meatball.   it's not moving.  we need help.  eee eee eep.  wow.  what's gonna happen.  ha ha ha. ha ha ha.  ohh.  oh, no. it didn't work.  huh.  wait. look. he's stopping.  i can't believe it.  it worked.  we solved the problem. ha ha.  how'd you come up with a humungous meatball.  what goes better with macaroni than meatballs.  ha ha ha.  and it looks like he found something he likes to play with.  great. come on, macaronisaurus.  i'm open.  huh.  unh.  good job, fairies.  ha ha ha.  ha ha ha.  ha ha ha.  a little help.  hi. this is my friend rocco. hi.

in the sky like other birds.   e flapped his wings, but that didn't work.    he jumped in the air, but that didn't work.    he even tried getting a running start.  that didn't work either.  his little penguin body wasn't made to get off the ground.   that's penguin for "i'm going to fly if it's "  which is penguin for "you're full of hot "  " he was flying in the sky in a hot air balloon.  he was full of hot air.    soon, all the other penguins took to the sky, too.   they flew in airplanes, in helicopters, in blimps, even hang gliders, anything that was made to fly in the sky, and the little penguin lived happily ever after in the sky of course.

whoa.  be with you in a minute.  i'm glad you're here.  today at flying fairy school, everyone is making mystical, magical macaroni art, so come on.  raise your wand or your finger, and let's get to it.  what kind of mystical, magical macaroni art can i make.  ooh. i know.  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 sides.  oh. it's a macaroni hexagon.  wait. i changed my mind.  oh. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 sides.  it's now a macaroni octagon.  wait. i changed my mind again.  is she gonna make a macaroni pentagon, a macaroni heptagon, a macaroni tetradecagon.  actually, it's a macaroni horsey. ha ha.  what mystical, magical macaroni art are you going to make, gonnigan.  oh. i already made mine.  it's a bowl of macaroni made completely of macaroni.  eep. eep eep. eep.   eep.  hey. don't eat my art.  it brings down the value.  if you want to see some great mystical, magical macaroni art, then check this out.  it's gonna be big.  it's gonna be huge.  it's gonna be humungous.  whoa.  that is humungous.  what is it.  it's a dinosaur made completely of macaroni.  i call it macaronisaurus.  that is totally cool, blogg.  thank you, but it's not done yet.  i need something to bring it to life.  try glitter glue.  if you ask me, a little glitter glue always adds just the right amount of sparkle.  i was thinking of something a little more spicy.  what. like paprika.  no. this.  ooh.  the spice of life.  but if you put the spice of life on the humungous macaronisaurus, it will come alive.  well, what good is a macaronisaurus if you can't play with it.  if you make a macaronisaurus move from bottom to top, you'd better know how to make the macaronisaurus stop.  don't worry. i got it all under control.  now it's time to spice things up.  oh. i can't watch.  aw. it didn't work.  maybe the spice of life has passed its expiration date.   or maybe not. aah.  come on, macaronisaurus.  let's play some checkers.   maybe he's more of a chess person.  looks like he wants to play dressup.  ok by me.  we'll put on some tutus.   oh, what are we gonna do.  aah. ohh.  don't worry. i'll handle this.   come here, macaronisaurus.  that did not go as well as i hoped.  oh, no. we got to make it stop.  you have to use your noodles to figure this out.  using noodles is what got us into this mess in the first place.  not macaroni noodles, these kinds of noodles.  oh. right.  let's twinkle think.  what makes thin stop.  twinkle think, twinkle think, twinkle think.  i know.  dead batteries.  bicycle brakes.  a dancing kumquat wearing a polkadotted mumu.  huh.  that would make me stop.  how about a stop sign.  yeah. stop signs make people stop.  let's try a stop sign.  i'll head down to the department of transportation and see if they have any extras lying around.  wait, gonnigan.  we can just make a stop sign.  we need 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 pieces of ..  but that's just an octagon, not a stop sign.  it's the right shape, but there's something missing.  what is it.  this is never going to work.  we might as well just stop.  that's it. we need the word stop.  stop. stop.  stop.   it didn't work.  the macaronisaurus went right through the stop sign.  that's against the law.  eep eep.   eeeeep.  looks like niblet's gonna give him a ticket.  whatever he's doing, it's working.  that little gerbilcorn is stopping that humungous macaronisaurus.  eep eep eep.  hmm.   oh, no. it didn't work.  the flying fairy school is doomed.  take it easy, gonnigan.  keep thinking.  you just need to spot the solution.  that's it. spot.  we need spot's help.  here spot, here, boy.   now we need to find a way to solve the problem and stop a humungous macaroni dinosaur.  fetch, spot, fetch.   ha ha ha.  humungous.  humungous.  humungous.  humungous.  humungous.  we already know the macaronisaurus is humungous.  tell us something we don't know.  wait a minute.  maybe what spot is saying is that we need something humungous to stop something humungous.  now that's a humungous idea.  but what humungous thing do we need.  how about a humungous fence.   ha ha ha.  no, no. a humungous brick wall.   uh, uh, uh, a humungous meatball.  .  mama mia.  that's a humungousa meatball.  let's give it a try.  come on, guys. let's push that meatball.   it's not moving.  we need help.  eee eee eep.  wow.  what's gonna happen.  ha ha ha. ha ha ha.  ohh.  oh, no. it didn't work.  huh.  wait. look. he's
