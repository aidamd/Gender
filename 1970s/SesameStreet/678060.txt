ha ha ha. ha ha ha.  oh. silly goose.  geese lay eggs.  so do ducks.  elmo's friend cassidy has a duck that laid some eggs, and she told elmo all about it.  i live on a farm.  on our farm, we have ducks, and one of the ducks is named tracy.  she built her nest in our barnyard, and one day, tracy laid some eggs in her nest.  my mom said that baby ducks would hatch out of the eggs.  baby ducks are called ducklings.  i couldn't wait for the ducklings to hatch, but first, tracy had to sit on her eggs for a long time to keep them warm.   she sat in the sun, she sat at night.   she sat in the rain.  she sat and sat and sat.  she sat on the eggs for almost 4 weeks.  i thought those baby ducks would never come out.  then one day, my mom and i heard a little pecking sound.  tracy's eggs were hatching.  first, the ducklings broke through their shells, and then out popped the baby ducks.  it was amazing.  first, they were all wet, but soon, they were dry and fluffy and running around.  i like ducklings a lot, and i was really happy when they finally hatched, and so was tracy.  aren't those ducklings cute. ha ha.  tracy built a nice nest for her ducklings on the farm.  that makes elmo wonder where else can birds build their nests.  elmo wants to know. don't you.  let's find out.    oh. there you are.  ha ha ha.  the drawer sounds just like a bird.  tweet.   tweet tweet tweet.
