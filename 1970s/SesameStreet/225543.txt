wild animals calm when they're out of their cage.  uhoh.  rawwrr.  aah. aah.  rawwrr.  empty.  this blue jay's nest is empty.  empty is a word that means when something, like a nest, doesn't have anything in it.  there are 0 birds in the nest.  let's see what happens when he invites his bird friends over.   one fine evening, a blue jay had a party    9 birds altogether    blue jay and his friends    the nest was full    and everyone had a good time    now they say good night, farewell, and see you again    the robin flew away into the night    the pigeon hailed a cab and was out of sight    the penguin put a hat on and skied away    the duck put on a jetpack    waved goodbye to blue jay   there were 9 birds in the nest, but now there are 5.  is it empty yet.  no. that's right.   the toucan grabbed a skateboard    and so did the crane    the peacock grabbed a ladder    and was carried away    there was a guest left    and she was a flamingo    who jumped out of the nest    but she was ok    the blue jay waved goodbye to his guests    then he looked around and saw a phone in his nest   robin left it here by mistake"    "i'll fly it back to him"    "i hope he's still awake"   take a look at the nest now.  how many birds are left.  0. that's right.  so is the nest empty now.  yeah. all right.  it's a beautiful day to look around and explore the world.  let's see.  hey. look. it's a bird.  are you a little robin.  no. i'll give you a hint.  it starts with a "p".  oh. oh, i know.  you're a pelican. no.  uh, penguin. no.  uh, peacock.  no. i'm a pigeon. ugh.  you don't know nothing about birds.  aw. the pelican's right.  pigeon.  i don't know anything about birds.  aah.  ovejita.  .hola, murray.  i didn't even see you there.  hey, ovejita.  do you know anyplace that i can go to more about birds.  si. sigueme.  oh. come on. follow that lamb.   murray has a little lamb    yo, murray has a little lamb    who wears a little bow    go, murray    together, they go everywhere    amigos like to go    mmmurray    he follows her to school each day    they run, they spin, they leap    go, murray    yo, everybody loves to see    a monster and his sheep    and they all say    murray has a little lamb   ooh. what is this place.  this is the staten island zoo.  marc, what kind of birds can we see here at the zoo.  we have a lot of birds here, very small birds to very large birds like ostriches.  can you bring us a bird to look at now.  yes, we can. oh, my goodness.  we're gonna meet a bird.  si.  ooh. what kind of bird is that.  ohh.  this is a sun conure.

think we can meet more birds here at the zoo. yes, we can.  oh, boy.  in a little while, we're gonna meet some more birds here at the zoo, but right now, check this out.  he observes.  he questions.  he investigates.  what does this button do.  aah.  super grover 2.0.  he shows up.  somewhere by a woodland stream, 1 little duckling is about to waddle into a big problem.  ha. yippee.  oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.  i can't wait to get to the party.  it's going to be so much fun.  ohh.  a stream.  and the party is onthe other side.  oh, no. how will i ever get across.  help, help.  aah.  ohh, ohh.  super grover 2.0.  you showed up.  unh. it is what i do.  so what seems to be theproblem, little one.  i'm trying to get to that party over there, but i don't know how to get across the stream.  first, i shall unleashthe power of observation.  mmm.  oh, i don't want tomiss the party.  i see with mysuper eyes that you walk like a duck.  quack.  and i hearwith my super ears that you quack like a duck.  quack.  my super powers ofobservation tell me you are a duck.  of course i'm a duck.  quack.  well, then do notbe daffy, duck.  you can swimacross the stream.  everyone knows thatducks can swim.  well, yes, but ifi swim across, i'll ruin my brandnew party shoes.  look.  stunning.  wait. ducks can alsofly, can they not.  if you fly to the other side,your shoes will not get wet.  well, yes, but i'm justa duckling, a baby duck.  i haven't learned to fly yet.  ahh. a toddlerwaddler, i see.  so the question is howcan a duckling cross this stream without gettingher new shoes wet.  that's the question.  well, fear not, myfashionforward friend.  i will now unleashthe power of investigation.   excuse me.  sure.  ahh. i see the streamis full of water.  no wonder it is so wet.  we must soak upall this water and dry out the stream.  how. have you gota plan up your sleeve.  no, but i havea towel down my sock.  ah ha ha.  this highly absorbentpaper towel should do the trick.  1 paper towel.  i don't think that's enoughto soak up all the water in the stream, super grover.  i beg toduffer, dickiediffer, duckie.  observe as i simply dipthis towel into the stream.  and would you look atall the water it absorbed.  yes. ha. there.  you can run alongto your party now.  the stream is all dried up.  no. no, it's not.  it's still full of water.  what.  if only there werea bridge here.  what's that now.  you know, something sturdyand dry that connects one side of a stream to the other side.  oh, you meana crossy over thing.  what good would that do.  well, i could walk across itwithout my shoes getting wet.  well, then stand back,for i super grover 0 will now unleash the power ofengineering and design you a crossy over thing.  you mean a bridge.  yeah. whatever.  ahh.   design, design, design   and tada.  a bridge made of broccoli.  yes. it isthe latest in green design.  what do you think.  well, i don't think thatbroccoli is the right thing to ..  of course it is.  ver.  now let me check my utilitysock for some broccoli.  ahh, ahh.  there we are.  and now i will justfollow my design and place this broccoliacross the stream.  the broccoli's notlong enough to reach the other sideof the stream.  now i'll never getto the party.   i'm gonna cry.  waah waah waah.  it is your party,and you can cry if you want to, but i know what i must do.  what.  find a longerpiece of broccoli.  there must be onehere somewhere.   what is ts woodroundy thingy doing in my sock.  hey. maybe wecould use that.  do not be silly.  this is not broccoli.  it's a log,super grover, and it looks like itmight be long enough to stretchacross the stream.  not now, little waddler.  ..  i must find thatpesky vegetable.  then it's time for meto unleash the power of engineering.  super grover, look.  i designed my own bridge.  that's not broccoli. agh.  i guess i'll justbuild the bridge myself then.  i can just push thislog over to the stream.  the broccoli.  ahh. super grover, i did it.  i engineereda bridge with the log.  it was long enough.  ok. let's see if this works.  ahh.  i'll start on this sideand waddle, waddle, waddle, waddle, waddle, waddle,waddle to the other side without getting myshoes wet.  ha.  it worked.  now i can go to the party.  thanks for the log,super grover.  ahh. do not thankme, you lucky duckie.  enjoy the party.  and so our hero learned thatan engineer eds the right size and shape materialsto solve a problem.  well, it looks as thoughmy work here is done.  up, up, and away.  aah.  ohh.  perhaps next time,i should take the bridge.  welcome tothe party, super grover.  party.  well, while i'm here, imight as well get my party on.  ha ha. yeah.  whoo.   jump up, get down    come dance with elmo    we're moving our body to
