to the flying fairy school    grab your wands   yeeha.   bring your wings  yeah.   we will learn magic things    let's all hurry to the flying fair school    how to make us grow    and how to make us shrink   whoa.   how to solve a problem with a simple twinkle think    the school is really magic    and magic's really cool    let's go in, let's begin    it's flying fairy school   ha ha ha.  ha ha.  oh. hmm. hmm. ohh.  mm.  welcome to the flying fairy school puppet theater.  it's puppet time, so grab a puppet and make it move.  ok, puppet, let's see your moves.  excuse me, puppet. aah. oh, no.   i can't feel a pulse.  go on, breathe, darn you. breathe.  blogg, you do know that puppet's not alive, don't you.  not on my watch.  it worked.  it's a miracle.  hey, what are you doing with those strings.  puppets can't move on their own.  you got to pull their strings to make them move, like this.  i can do that.  well, actually, i think it's more like this.  i don't need help.  well, maybe if youahahah.  i can do it myself.  ooh, this puppet stuff has too many strings attached.  i'll just get him to move another way.  i'm gonna turn this puppet into a real boy.  oh, that doesn't sound like a good idea.  i'll just use the blue fairy special, and i think it goes like this.  go to a luau, eat some poi, and turn this puppet into a real boy.  come on, real boy who was once a puppet.  let's boogie down.  why can't i boogie down.  you're a puppet.  nonsense. puppets are made of wood.   aah. i'm a puppet.  looks like someone tried to turn a puppet into a real boy.  don't worryi can just turn myself back.   i'm afraid that's impossible even if you could move your arms.  you see, the only way to turn a puppet into a real boy is to go through the pinocchio process.  what's the pinocchio process.  the pinocchio process is a series of steps that goes like this.  hop with a cricket, do the donkey dance of joy, swim with a whale, and you'll become a real boy.  looks like we have to find some animals.  yeah. first up, a cricket.  i can do that. no problem.   um, maybe i'd better poof us there.  but where do you find a cricket.  well, a cricket's an insect, and i always see insects out in the grass.  then let's get up and get out of class and look for a cricket in the grass.  all right, class, let's find a cricket.  they look like this.   ah, something moved.  oh, is it a cricket.  hey, can't a ladybug get some privacy.  a ladybug. ha. we better keep looking.   maybe it's a cricket.  yikes. what kind of bug is that.  time for a termite snack.   a termite. they eat wood, you know.  .   this wood tastes like feet. blergh.  ha. what's that sound.   it's a cricket.  go, boy. time to hop.  you want us to help pull your strings.  nah. i can do it myself.   well, you can help if you want, but i definitely do not need it.   hop, hop, hop. hop, hop, hop.  my legs. they're back to normal.  yay.  darn you.  why is the rest of blogg's body still puppet.  because blogg has to go through the next step of the pinocchio processthe donkey dance of joy.  then let us go find a donkey.  we don't need a giraffe or a monkey.  what we need is a donkey.  come on, donkey.  let us do the donkey dance of joy.   donkey tells me he does not want to do the donkey dance of joy.  probably because he's a very angry donkey.  aah. what are we gonna do.  maybe we need something to make that donkey happy.  but what makes donkeys happy.  i don't know. let's ask spot.  spot. oh, spot.   oh, hi, spot.  how do you make a donkey happy.  fetch, spot, fetch.   hay. hay. hay.   go and tell your whole class    that it comes from the dry grass    you find it in a haystack    some animals have it for a snack   ..hay.    what did that song have to do with donkeys.  let's twinkle think.   twinkle think, twinkle think   i know. yow.  i think the donkey is a punk rocker.  i think the answer probably has something to do with hay.   oh. oh.  no, that can't be it.  sure it can, gonnigan.  the song said animals have hay for a snack.  maybe the donkey's hungry, hungry for hay.  ok, then, listen to what i say.  give us a big plate of hay.     and the donkey's happy.  and he's doing the donkey dance of joy.  i got to dance with him.  i don't need help.  if you insist.     heehaw. heehaw.  heehaw.  wow. it worked.  blogg's arms and wings are back now.  but i still have a puppet head.  that's because you haven't done the last step of the pinocchio process.  you have to swim with a whale.  and whales live in the ocean, so, let's get our wheels in motion.  poof on down to the ocean.  well, here we are, and there's the whale.  aah. i didn't expect it to be so huge.  now's your chance, blogg. swim with a whale.  ok. here i go.   what's wrong.  i can't do it.  your arms and legs and wings are all back to normal.  but i don't know how you swim.  oh, no.  maybe you can ask for something to get you to swim.  ah. how about rocket fins.  .. ok. i admit it.  i can't do this on my own. i need help.  you heard him, gonnigan.  ok. i can help. i think.  let's swim.  and reach and pull and akick, kick, kick and areach and apull and a kickkickkick.  i'm doing it. i'm swimming with a whale.  and i'm back to normal.  yay.  thanks, whale, and thank you all.  i couldn't have done it without you.  you're welcome.  swimming with whales was really cool, but now let's all go back to school.  i know a different way to get them to move.  no.   dadumdadado, dadumdado   great work, blogg.   dadumdadado, dadumdado    i love puppets.  me, too. ha ha.  ernie, what are you doing.  it's

this one, we grow things that look pretty.  and sometimes things that look pretty are also things that you can eat.  wait a minute. spinach.  spinach has leaves.  can they grow in the garden.  yes. wow.  are you ready to plant some seeds.  just like that.  you know what i like.  i like flowers.  yeah, me, too.   ah. que bonita.  what color do flowers come in.  white, pink, red, and purple.  and purple.  and how about my favorite color of all.  an orange flower.  orange.  well, right now, we don't have any orange flowers.  maybe i could just stand there like this and pretend to be the orange flower.  how do you plant a flower.  you use seeds and water and sunshine.  that's so much stuff a flower needs.  i thought you just put it there and it just grows.  no, no.  so what do i do first when i'm gonna plant.  we want to rake off any debris, any bits of old plant or petals.  we want to make sure the soil looks nice and clean.  so here's what we're going to do.  when we plant, we're going to use this.  this is a trowel.  does everybody know what a trowel is.  shovel.  it is.  it's like a really small shovel.  now, they're not very big, but they are kind of heavy, so you do have to be careful, ok.  just like sugar on a spoon.  put it right next to the hole.  perfect.  kareem, i'm really good at digging.  watch my digging moves.  you ready.  ugh, ah.  ugh, ah.  ugh, ah.  you

to the flying fairy school    grab your wands   yeeha.   bring your wings  yeah.   we will learn magic things    let's all hurry to the flying fair school    how to make us grow    and how to make us shrink   whoa.   how to solve a problem with a simple twinkle think    the school is really magic    and magic's really cool    let's go in, let's begin    it's flying fairy school   ha ha ha.  ha ha.  oh. hmm. hmm. ohh.  mm.  welcome to the flying fairy school puppet theater.  it's puppet time, so grab a puppet and make it move.  ok, puppet, let's see your moves.  excuse me, puppet. aah. oh, no.   i can't feel a pulse.  go on, breathe, darn you. breathe.  blogg, you do know that puppet's not alive, don't you.  not on my watch.  it worked.  it's a miracle.  hey, what are you doing with those strings.  puppets can't move on their own.  you got to pull their strings to make them move, like this.  i can do that.  well, actually, i think it's more like this.  i don't need help.  well, maybe if youahahah.  i can do it myself.  ooh, this puppet stuff has too many strings attached.  i'll just get him to move another way.  i'm gonna turn this puppet into a real boy.  oh, that doesn't sound like a good idea.  i'll just use the blue fairy special, and i think it goes like this.  go to a luau, eat some poi, and turn this puppet into a real boy.  come on, real boy who was once a puppet.  let's boogie down.  why can't i boogie down.  you're a puppet.  nonsense. puppets are made of wood.   aah. i'm a puppet.  looks like someone tried to turn a puppet into a real boy.  don't worryi can just turn myself back.   i'm afraid that's impossible even if you could move your arms.  you see, the only way to turn a puppet into a real boy is to go through the pinocchio process.  what's the pinocchio process.  the pinocchio process is a series of steps that goes like this.  hop with a cricket, do the donkey dance of joy, swim with a whale, and you'll become a real boy.  looks like we have to find some animals.  yeah. first up, a cricket.  i can do that. no problem.   um, maybe i'd better poof us there.  but where do you find a cricket.  well, a cricket's an insect, and i always see insects out in the grass.  then let's get up and get out of class and look for a cricket in the grass.  all right, class, let's find a cricket.  they look like this.   ah, something moved.  oh, is it a cricket.  hey, can't a ladybug get some privacy.  a ladybug. ha. we better keep looking.   maybe it's a cricket.  yikes. what kind of bug is that.  time for a termite snack.   a termite. they eat wood, you know.  .   this wood tastes like feet. blergh.  ha. what's that sound.   it's a cricket.  go, boy. time to hop.  you want us to help pull your strings.  nah. i can do it myself.   well, you can help if you want, but i definitely do not need it.   hop, hop, hop. hop, hop, hop.  my legs. they're back to normal.  yay.  darn you.  why is the rest of blogg's body still puppet.  because blogg has to go through the next step of the pinocchio processthe donkey dance of joy.  then let us go find a donkey.  we don't need a giraffe or a monkey.  what we need is a donkey.  come on, donkey.  let us do the donkey dance of joy.   donkey tells me he does not want to do the donkey dance of joy.  probably because he's a very angry donkey.  aah. what are we gonna do.  maybe we need something to make that donkey happy.  but what makes donkeys happy.  i don't know. let's ask spot.  spot. oh, spot.   oh, hi, spot.  how do you make a donkey happy.  fetch, spot, fetch.   hay. hay. hay.   go and tell your whole class    that it comes from the dry grass    you find it in a haystack    some animals have it for a snack   ..hay.    what did that song have to do with donkeys.  let's twinkle think.   twinkle think, twinkle think   i know. yow.  i think the donkey is a punk rocker.  i think the answer probably has something to do with hay.   oh. oh.  no, that can't be it.  sure it can, gonnigan.  the song said animals have hay for a snack.  maybe the donkey's hungry, hungry for hay.  ok, then, listen to what i say.  give us a big plate of hay.     and the donkey's happy.  and he's doing the donkey dance of joy.  i got to dance with him.  i don't need help.  if you insist.     heehaw. heehaw.  heehaw.  wow. it worked.  blogg's arms and wings are back now.  but i still have a puppet head.  that's because you haven't done the last step of the pinocchio process.  you have to swim with a whale.  and whales live in the ocean, so, let's get our wheels in motion.  poof on down to the ocean.  well, here we are, and there's the whale.  aah. i didn't expect it to be so huge.  now's your chance, blogg. swim with a whale.  ok. here i go.   what's wrong.  i can't do it.  your arms and legs and wings are all back to normal.  but i don't know how you swim.  oh, no.  maybe you can ask for something to get you to swim.  ah. how about rocket fins.  .. ok. i admit it.  i can't do this on my own.

flower.  how do you plant a flower.  you use seeds and water and sunshine.  that's so much stuff a flower needs.  i thought you just put it there and it just grows.  no, no.  so what do i do first when i'm gonna plant.  we want to rake off any debrisy bits of old plant or petals.  we want to make sure the soil looks nice and clean.  so here's what we're going to do.  when we plant, we're going to use this.  this is a trowel.  does everybody know what a trowel is.  shovel.  it is.  it's like a really small shovel.  now, they're not very big, but they are kind of heavy, so you do have to be careful, ok.  just like sugar on a spoon.  put it right next to the hole.  perfect.  kareem, i'm really good at digging.  watch my digging moves.  you ready.  ugh, ah.  ugh, ah.  ugh, ah.  you think
