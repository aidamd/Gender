bottles and reuse them.  oh, cool. ha ha ha.  well, what that little piggy needs is mud.  it's too clean.  hi, oscar. yeah.  you know, just like this whole place is too clean.  it smells like flowery fabric softener. yuck.  but that's what you do at a laundromat, oscar, clean clothes.  which is why i'm out of here as soon as i pick up my weekly lint supply.  here you are, oscar.  enjoy, i guess.

trouble.  i'm sorry to say this, but i think it's time to get rid of it.  but leela just said leela doesn't like to throw things away.  i know, but it's not working right anymore.  see. would you listen to that.  ah. it's music to my ears.  yeah. it's got to go.  no, no, leela.  it's a nice machine.  don't throw it away, please.  well, i could ask luis to try and fix it again.  ugh. that's a

oh. uh, leela, what does a wrench look like.  a wrench has a little opening at the top.  it looks kind of like a little letter "c".  let's look for a tool that looks like the letter "c".  gee.  oh.  hmm. does this look like a letter "c".  no. no. this looks like the letter "i".  let's keep looking.  does this look like the letter "c".  no. it doesn't look like the letter "c".  yes. this looks like the letter "c".  luis, luis, here's the wrench that's shaped like the letter "c".  ah. perfect, elmo. thanks.  i'll just tighten this bolt down here.  all right. all set.  now i'll just turn it back on and see if that did the trick.   no more noise.  oh, yay. luis did it. luis did it.  the machine is fixed.  you just ruined a perfectly good machine.  i'll just look inside and see how it's working.  ugh.  ooh. ooh. oh, no.   oh.  oh. uh, here, luis.  i'm really, really sorry.  i'm glad i stuck around.  this is better than cable. heh heh heh.  let's forget about this.  i'm getting rid of the machine.  no, no, no. it's a good machine, leela.  it just needs to be fixed.  don't throw it away.  i'm willing to give it another try.  i'm not ready to throw in the towel yet.  aw, what a party pooper. ugh.  how is luis going to fix it now.  well, first, i'll replace the water hose, and then i'll find a new nut for the main bolt.  oh, and you can help me be finding a nut in the shape of a hexagon.  there should be one in here.  i better turn this off.  um, what's a hexagon again.  it's a shape with 6 equal sides.  6 equal sides. right.  let's look for a shape with 6 equal sides.  let's see.  oh. let's see.  look at this.  how many sides does it have.  let's count.  1, 2, 3, 4.  4. only 4 equal sides.  let's keep looking.  oh.  how about this one.  let's count.  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.  6 sides. yeah. this is the one.  it's a hexagon.  yep. luis, here is your hexagon nut.  oh, yeah. looks like a perfect fit.  thank you, elmo.  i'll just put it on and tighten it up.  that's ok, washing

that.  why, you could sell tickets.  or i could just get rid of it once and for all.  no, leela. luis can fix it.  try again, luis.  i wonder if there's something stuck in the spin basket.  oh.  don't worry. it's turned off.  oh.  a sock.  huh.  another sock.  1 sock plus 1 sock is 2 socks stuck in the machine.  ha ha ha.  hold on. there's more.  there's more.  oh, ho ho ho. toy cars.  well, that

this is too much.  i'm getting rid of it.  well, no. can't luis fix it again.  no. i've tried everything i can, elmo.  maybe elmo can think of a way to reuse it the way leela reused the bottles.  how can we reuse an old washing machine.  this is the greatest washing machine ever.  what did oscar say.  this is the greatest washing machine ever.  what of it.  that's it. what's it.  well, elmo knows

family dance.  her family likes to eat together.  they all had lunch at a chinese restaurant for her grandma's birthday.  and reena told elmo all about it.  we sat at a round table with the food in the middle so the whole family could share in it.  as the youngest, i poured tea for everybodymy grandma, my grandpa, my father, my mother, my uncles, and aunts.  actually, i wasn't the youngest.  but babies can't pour tea.  grandma and grandpa took the food first because they are the oldest.  everyone else waited until they started to eat.  then everyone ate, the whole family.  everyone used chopsticks, except for my younger brother.  but i'm teaching him how.  he's learning.  someday he can teach the baby, then be able to eat long noodles.  we always eat them because they mean a long life.  they worked for my grandmother. she is 80.  and we finished with orange slices, which means a sweet life.  and that's what our whole family did for my grandma's 80th birthday.  i poured the tea, and the food was delicious.  elmo loves reena's family.  elmo wants to see more families, all kinds, but where could elmo find them.  hmm.  elmo knows whereon the family channel.  oh, tv, come on
