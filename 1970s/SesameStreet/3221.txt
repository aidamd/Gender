how you really feel.  i like to dance because it makes me really happy.  i don't like to dance because sometimes when i dance i get kind of shy.  i like to dance my own way.  i like to dance because it is fun and it's like playing.  i kind of listen to any song, and i just kind of dance to it.  i just find the rhythm of it, and i find a dance that kind of fits good with it.  if you dance, you can do yoga poses, too.  i dance because it really helps me get my inner feelings out.  like, i like to hula, and we got in a group.  i like to dance to soft music like you might hear in ballet.  i think a ridiculous dance is, like, when you have too much drama in it.  it is i your cute and fuzzy pal grover.  and i am your cute and fuzzy pal aziz.  ah ha ha ha.  and we are here to tell you all about
