if we want to look cool.cool.  actually, not anymore.  sunglasses just became uncool.  oh, come on.  oh, how are we supposed to know what's cool if it keeps changing.  that's why we need the web site so we can stay on top of what we should like next.  guys, guys, you don't need a web site to tell you what to like.  how about music.  let's see what music is cool.cool now.  go. press it.  ok. all right. here we are, here we go.   huh.  is this music cool.cool.  it says here that it is, and look, look.  there's a dance that goes with it.  there.  hmm.  that's the whole dance, huh.  i think so.  we should try it.  ok. ok. here we go.  hmmmmmmmm.   hmmmmmmmm.  well, it's kind ofan unusual dance.  it doesn't look likeyou're having much fun.  not really. nope.  well, then why are you doing it.  because it's supposed to be cool.cool.  telly, elmo doesn't like dancing this way.  me neither.  i don't get it.  this music is on the web site, so why don't we like it.  guys, guys, you shouldn't like something just because some web site tells that you should.  yeah, yeah.  well, my favorite music isn't on there, and i think there's nothing better than a good oldfashioned sea shanty.  a sea shanty. uhhuh.  oh, you know.  it's a song that sailors would sing on sailing ships long ago.  listen.   let's sing a song of a happy sailor    let's sing a song of a happy sailor    let's sing a song

looked fun.  too bad it's not on the cool.cool web site.  but what if it's not.  abby doesn't need to follow what other people tell her to do.  abby likes to be an original.  ha ha ha. well, it's true.  i just like to do the things that make me happy.  why are we letting a web site tell us what we should like.  we should be more original.  we know what we like, and if it's not on there, so what.  yeah. abby had the right idea all along.  she doesn't care about being cool.cool.  ha ha. nope. all i can be is me.me.  right, and all you can be is you.you.   there will always be someone saying, "you can have fun"    "if you like what we all like"    "got to stick to a rule"    "if you want to be cool"    but that really isn't right    truth is, you're never gonna feel much better    trying to be like someone else    the way you are is perfect    and is always worth it    if you just simply can be yourself   you   me    there's nothing else that will do    there's no one else we can be    to your own self be true    so that everyone can see    exactly what makes you you    and also what makes me me            show the world what makes you you    and your specialness    comes shining through   i like hats with triangles.  yeah, telly.  you   i like sunglasses with hearts.   que bonita   you   elmo likes dancing this way.  go, elmo.  you   and i like my friends just the way they are.  you   you   you   me    i got to be me, yeah, yeah    there's nothing else that will do    you got to be you    there's nothing else we can be    i've got to be me    to your own self be

wait a minute. where is ovejita. ovejita.  hee hee hee.  ovejita.  hee hee hee.  ovejita. whee. ooh.  ha ha ha. ovejita.  hola, murray.  what school are we going to today.  ven conmigo. whee.  follow that little lamb.   murray has a little lamb    yo, murray has a little lamb    who wears a little bow    go, murray    together, they go everywhere    amigos like to go    mmmurray    he follows her to school each day    they run, they spin, they leap    go, murray    yo, everybody loves to see    a monster and his sheep    and they all say    murray has a little lamb   whoa. what school is this.  robot school.  robot school. what do we do at robot school.  we build robots.  in a little while, we're gonna build some robots, but right now, let's check this out.  he observes.  oh, look.  no. no. aah.  he questions.  hubbawha.  he investigates.  hmm. what does this button do.  aah.  super grover 2.0.  he shows up.  where 2 trees grow inbrooklyn, a bird family is trying to deal with avery heavy problem.   we'll neverget it up into our nest.  oh. we need help.  look. up in the sky.  is that a bird.  i don't know what that is.  aah.  watch the laundry.  it issuper grover 2.0.  wow. a real superhero.  what can i do for you,my fine feathered fiends.  well, we need to getsomething into our nest.  that will be no problem.  what do you cute, littlebirdies need to get up to your nest.  a grand piano.  hmm. just a grand pianwow.  that is a big piano.  maybe too big.  i don't know if we'll everget that thing up there.  of course you will oncei unleash my powers of observation.  i observe this piano is big.  i observe this is piano hard.  ugh. i observe thispiano is heavy.  aah.  that's the problem.  how will we ever get thisheavy piano up to our nest.  do not worry, beaked ones.  i will now unleash mypowers of investigation.  did you hear that.  he's going to unleash hispowers of investigation.  i appreciateyour enthusiasm.  let me check my utility sock.  aha. aha.  this will do the trick.  a spatula.  not just any spatula.  this is a superspatula.  i will flip this pianolike a pancake.  unh.  ohh.  i don't think thatflipping it will work, super grover 2.0.  i think you need tolift it somehow.  or maybe i need to lift it somehow.  let me find a different piece of technology.  let's see. ahh.  but of course. balloons.   up, up, and away, balloons.  we're justnever gonna get our piano up to our nest.   i willsimply try something else.  uhoh. whoa.  i observe that iam being lifted up.  ohh.  hey. you'reruining my laundry.  i will notsoil your wingbacked shirts.  hey. don't hangon that rope.  you'll break it.  ow.  ach. now i have tostart all over again.  a little help.all right.  ok, flapping family.i am up now.  ohh.  hey. i wonder ifthat rope could help.  or maybe thisrope could help.  good thinking,super grover 2.0.  hyah. hyah, piano, hyah.  get along, little doggy.  no, no, no, not likethat, super grover.  i was thinking youcould use the rope to lift the piano, you know, justlike we lifted you.  we could flythe rope over that branch above our nest.  and we can tie thisend to the piano.  i applaud your initiative,wee winged ones, but stand clear.  this is a job for a superhero.   ok. you can help a little bit.  this was a lot easier whenwe were pulling super grover.  maybe ican unleash my powers of observation.  hey. that's my line.  ..  we used that wheelie partwhen we were pulling super grover 2.0.  you're right. i thinkthat's called a pulley.  there'sa pulley right above our nest.  i wonder what would happenif we put the rope into the pulley and then we triedto lift the piano.  you tiny, little birdiescannot figure this out by yourselves, but do not worry.  i will think of a way for you.  1, 2, 3, pull.  perhaps a bungee cord.  and pull.  or a giant kite.  we did it. we did it.  we did.  and so our furry, bluesuperhero has discovered that pulleys can make it easierto lift up heavy things.  all in a day's workfor super grover 2.whoa.  oh. ohh.  i think we are going toneed that pulley again.    jump up, get down    come dance with elmo    we're moving our body to the abcs    dance nearby    whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh    dance
