cow clue, well, just relax    and look around for some animal tracks    cow feet leave marks both here and there    so, look for cow tracks, you cowmonster pair   thanks for the cow clues, singing cowpoke.  animal feet leave tracks.  yep, yep, and we cowmonsters are gonna look for cow tracks and find that cow.  ok. let's look for some cow tracks.  look. do you see what i see.  oh, elmo sees those animal tracks.  not just any animal trackscow tracks.  ..hah.  now, stand back while i lasso me a cow.  all right.  aah. oh. oh. telly.  ah, did he do it. did he catch my cow.  cowmonster elmo says cowmonster telly caught the cow.   hey, hey, slow down, cow.  oh, that is one strangelooking cow.   that's because it's a chicken.  oh, oh, well, cowmonster elmo better tell cowmonster telly.  cowmonster telly, cowmonster telly, that hey, this is a chicken.   but what about these cow tracks.  elmo doesn't think those are cow tracks, telly.  well, looklook at the chicken's foot.  hmm. claw. my foot's called a claw.  well, look at the chicken's claw.  it matches the animal tracks.  the chicken's claw is long with one, two, 3 long toes, and the tracks is long with one, two, 3 long toe marks.  yeah. they are the same.  they're chicken tracks.  yeah, and the cowmonster pair doesn't need a chicken.    oh. i'd better go file a missing cow report.  we'll help you find your cow.  how. well, just listen to the song.   don't give up just 'cause the plot thickened    and you mistakenly lassoed a chicken    cow tracks are kinda round, i do declare    so, look for rounder tracks, you cowmonster pair   oh. oh, oh, cow tracks are kinda round.  if the singing cowboy sung it, i believe it.  let's go find some animal tracks that are kinda round.  yeah. yeehah. yeehah.   oh, cow master telly. hmm.  are there any signs of animal tracks that are kinda round.  not yet, cowmonster elmo.  oh, do you see any animal tracks that are kinda round. huh.  look. what.  over there.  oh, animal tracks, yay. ha.  ah, but are they kinda round.  wwell, let's see. yeah, go.  i know this track has a circle right here.  and, let's see, which iswhich is round.  mmhmm. and let's see.  one, two, 3, four ovals, which are kind of round, so this animal track is definitely kinda round.  then it must be a cow track.  i'm finally gonna get my cow back.  yeehah. got my lasso here andbah.  ha ha ha. whoa. whoa.   uhh. i got the cow. i got the cow.   that's a really small cow.  that's because it's a raccoon.  a raccoon. yes.  well, what about the cow tracks on oscar's can.  oh, look at the raccoon's hand.  paw. huh.  my hand's called a paw.  look at the raccoon's paw, cowmonster telly.  see, it has a circle in the middle and one, two, 3, 4 oval fingers, just like the animal tracks on the can.  these must be raccoon tracks.  yeah, and cowmonster elmo and cowmonster telly aren't looking for a raccoon.  oh. right. sorry, raccoon.  oh. whatthere you go.  there you go. that's it. there you go.  oh, i sure do miss my cow.  she would moomoo here and moomoo there.  i really could use a moomoo.  don't give up hope, little bo peep.  we just need another musical cow clue.   cows don't have paws like those raccoons    their tracks look a bit like two halfmoons    they don't have fingers or toes anywhere    so look for moonshaped tracks, you cowmonster pair   the cow track looked like two halfmoons.  got it. now, come on.  let's look for cow tracks.  yeah. yeehah. yeehah.  oh, oh, elmo sees tracks.  ooh, look at them.  yeah. here they go.  they go up this way. they go up the steps.  yeah. whoa.  yeah. and look at that.  they're kinda round and look like two halfmoons.  wow. they must be cow tracks.  ...hah.  i'll believe it when i see it.  all right. come to papa, cow.  whoa. all right.  i gotwhoa whoa, telly.   i got the cow. i got the cow.  eh. whoa.  that cow looks awfully big.  that's because it's a moose. oh.  what's a moose doing on sesame street.  oh, i thought this was the tundra.  oh, what was i thinking. oh.  look, telly, the moose's foot.  hoof. what.  a moose's foot is called a hoof, eh.  oh, oh, the moose'sthe moose's foot looks like two halfmoons, like this one.  oh, those must be moose tracks over there.  yeah, and we don't need to find a moose.  oh, but i need to find someplace cold.  i'm sweating my antlers off, eh. see ya.  aah. wha.  oh, you'll never find my cow.  yes, the cowmonster pair will.  maybe little bo peep is right, elmo.  maybe we can't find her cow.  well, of course the cowmonster pair can.  just listen to the song.   time to give up 'cause it's no use    you didn't find a cow, you found a moose    you just can't do it, haven't got a prayer    it's quittin' time for the cowmonster pair   oh, my poor cow is lost for good.  come on, elmo. let's go home.  elmo and telly can't give up.  but there are no more cow clues.  even the singing cowpoke gave up.  well, well, maybe the cowmonster pair doesn't need any more cow clues.  maybe cowmonster telly and cowmonster elmo can figure it out for themselves.  how. well, let's see.  um, the cow tracks are kind of round and look like two halfmoons.  yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, but the moose tracks look just like this, too.  ok, ok, but a cow is smarter than a moose, right.  yeah, i guess.  so, maybe the cowmonster pair just has to find some animal tracks that looklook like the moose tracks, only smaller.  hey, yeah.  the tracks need to be kind of round, like two halfmoons.  yeah. and smaller.  good thinking, cowmonster elmo.  now let's find that cow.  yeah, come on. let's look for cow tracks.  yeehah.  hmm.  oh, oh, tracks. oh, yeah.  elmo sees tracks.  oh, is it my cow's tracks.  no, these are the chicken claw tracks.  we need tracks that are kinda round and look like two halfmoons.  let's keep looking.  all right.  wait a minute. tracks.  oh, let it be cow. let it be cow.  .. yeah, they are.  but i think these are the raccoon paw tracks, remember.  cow tracks need to look like two halfmoons.  yeah.  let's keep looking. yeah.  they're still raccoon.  yeah. there it goes.  yeah. no, no raccoon.  no raccoon.  oh, wait a minute. tracks. what.  lookand they're shaped like two halfmoons.  yes, yes, cow.  nope, nope, too big.  cow tracks look a lot like that, only smaller.  ohh.  ahem. wait a minute.  uhoh. look. lookmore tracks.  lots of tracks.  and they're smaller than the moose tracks.  hey, and these tracks look like two halfmoons.  oh, those have to be cow tracks, right.  yeah. yeah.  ah ha ha ha ha. yeehah.  yeehah. wait a minute.  wait. wait, wait, wait.  where's the tracks. where's the tracks.  theyi don't know. they just stopped here.  huh. right at this rope.  huh. well, what do we do.  oh, ever try

work, little bo peep.  now, if you'll excuse us, us cowmonsters gotta mosey on back to hooper's to finish our breakfast. ha.  yeah, happy trails. yeehah.  ..some clues and some knowhow    they thought

that's a pair.  that's right. oh, boy.  elmo wishes he could be part of a pair.  well, now, wait a minute, elmo.  what.  there's one of you. yeah.  and there is one of me. yeah.  .. ah, yes.  .. one,

"elephant is a word that starts with "e"      eh, eheh eh eh, elephant   hey, navin, what's up next.  abby's flying fairy school.  booyah.    look up high in the sky    it's a school, it can fly    let's all hurry to the flying fairy school    grab your wands   yeeha.   bring your wings  yeah.   we will learn magic things    let's all hurry to the flying fair school    how to make us grow    and how to make us shrink   whoa.   how to solve a problem with a simple twinkle think    the school is really magic    and magic's really cool    let's go in, let's begin    it's flying fairy school   ha ha ha.  ha ha.  oh. hmm. hmm. ohh.  mm.  welcome to the flying fairy school puppet theater.  it's puppet time, so grab a puppet and make it move.  ok, puppet, let's see your moves.  excuse me, puppet. aah. oh, no.   i can't feel a pulse.  go on, breathe, darn you. breathe.  blogg, you do know that puppet's not alive, don't you.  not on my watch.  it worked.  it's a miracle.  hey, what are you doing with those strings.  puppets can't move on their own.  you gotta pull their strings to make them move, like this.  i can do that.  well, actually, i think it's more like this.  i don't need help.  well, maybe if youahahah.  i can do it myself.  ooh, this puppet stuff has too many strings attached.  i'll just get him to move another way.  i'm gonna turn this puppet into a real boy.  oh, that doesn't sound like a good idea.  i'll just use the blue fairy special, and i think it goes like this.  go to a luau, eat some poi, and turn this puppet into a real boy.  come on, real boy who was once a puppet.  let's boogie down.  why can't i boogie down.  you're a puppet.  nonsense. puppets are made of wood.   aah. i'm a puppet.  looks like someone tried to turn a puppet into a real boy.  don't worryi can just turn myself back.   i'm afraid that's impossible even if you could move your arms.  you see, the only way to turn a puppet into a real boy is to go through the pinocchio process.  what's the pinocchio process.  the pinocchio process is a series of steps that goes like this.  hop with a cricket, do the donkey dance of joy, swim with a whale, and you'll become a real boy.  looks like we have to find some animals.  yeah. first up, a cricket.  i can do that. no problem.   um, maybe i'd better poof us there.  but where do you find a cricket.  well, a cricket's an insect, and i always see insects out in the grass.  then let's get up and get out of class and look for a cricket in the grass.  all right, class, let's find a cricket.  they look like this.   ah, something moved.  oh, is it a cric hey, can't a ladybug get some privacy.  a ladybug. ha. we better keep looking.   maybe it's a cricket.  yikes. what kind of bug is that.  time for a termite snack.   a termite. they eat wood, you know.  .  dis woo tastes like feet. blergh.  ha. what's that sound.   it's a cricket.  go, boy. time to hop.  you want us to help pull your strings.  nah. i can do it myself.   well, you can help if you want, but i definitely do not need it.   hop, hop, hop. hop, hop, hop.  my legs. they're back to normal.  yay.  darn you.  uhoh. whyrest of blogg's body puppet.  because blogg has to go throught st w he pinroce th dance of joy.  then let us go find a donkey.  we don't need a giraffe or a monkey.  what we need is a donkey.  come on, donkey.  t uso the donkey dance of joy.   donkey tells me he does not want to do the donkey dance of joy.  probably because he's a very angry donkey.  aah. what are we gonna do.  we need something to maapnkey hstpy.  but what makes donkeys happy.  i don't know. let's ask spot.  spot. oh, spot.   oh, hi, spot.  how do you make a donkey happy.  ey fetch, spot, fetch.   hay. hay. hay.   go and tell your whole class    that it comes from the dry grass    you find it in a haystack    some animals have it for a snack   ..hay.    what did that song have to do with donkey let's twinklethink.   twinklethink, twinklethink   i know. yow.  i think the donkey is a punk rocker.  i think the answer probably has something to do with hay.   oh. oh.  no, that can't be it.  sure it can, gonnigan.  the song said animals have hay for a snack.  maybe the donkey's hungry, hungry for hay.  ok, then, listen to what i say.  give us a big plate of hay.     and the donkey's happy.  anth e donkey dance ojoy.  i gotta dance with him.  i don't need help.  if you insist.     heehaw. heehaw.  heehaw.  wow. it worked.  blogg's arms and wings are back now.  but i still have a puppet head.  that's because you ast step of the pinocchio process.  you have to swim with a whale.  and whales live in the ocean, so, let's get our wheels in motion.  poof on down to the ocean.  well, here we are, and there's the whale.  aah. i didn't expect it to be so huge.  now's your chance, blogg. swim with a whale.  ok. here i go.   what's wrong.  i can't do it.  your arms and legs and wings are all back to normal.  but i don't know how you swim.  oh, no.  maybe you can ask for something to get you to swim.  ah. how about rocket fins.  .. ok. i admit it.  i can't do this on my own. i need help.  you heard him, gonnigan.  ok. i can help. i think.  let's swim.  and reach and pull and akick, kick, kick and areach and apull and a kickkickkick.  i'm doing it. i'm swimming with a whale.  and i'm back to normal.  yay.  thanks, whale, and thank you all.  i couldn't have done it without you.  you're welcome.  swimming with whales was really cool, but now let's all go back to school.  i know a different way to get them to move.  no.   dadumdadado, dadumdado   great work, blogg.   dadumdadado, dadumdado    i love puppets.  me, too. ha ha.  ok, everybody, it's time to sing.  whoa, whoa, wait. no singing here.  no singing. i am admiring my bottle cap
