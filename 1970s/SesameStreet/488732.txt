just has one question.  uhuh. what's an amphibian.  an amphibian is a kind of animal.  what kind of animal.  that's for me to know and you to find out.  aw. aw.  oh, but don't worry.  i'll give you lots of clues along the way.  yay. yay. ha ha ha.  now here are the rules.  you got to find that amphibian before this tadpole turns into a frog.  what's a tadpole.  that's a tadpole.  he's a baby amphibian, and that leads us to your first clue.  what's clue, what's the clue.  like our little tadpole here, amphibians start out living in water.  oh, oh, oh. hurry up.  we got to find an animal that lives in the water.  don't worry, abby.  gordon told elmo it takes a long time for a tadpole to turn into a frog.  not in game show time.  that little tadpole's already sprouting tiny frog legs.  hey. you better start looking, and good luck.  uh..  find that amphibian.  let's go.  oh, yeah. which way, which way.  go, go, go, go.  i'm coming, elmo.  leela. hey, chris.  i'll have this to you by the end of the day.  great. thank you. see you.  leela, leela, leela, leela.  are you an amphibian.  an amphibian. mmhmm.  no.  ok. let's keep looking.  ok. maybe under here.  excuse me. do you do drycleaning.  oh. no.  elmo, look.  yeah.  that animal, it's living in water.  wow. that's nice. just like dorothy.  don't you remember our first clue.  amphibians start out living in water.  ..  we found that amphibian. yay.  this is, like, just so random.   sorry. that is not an amphibian.  well, what is it. yeah.  want to tell them what you are.  oh, sure. i am totally, like, a fish.  he is just like dorothy. ha ha ha.  you know, baby amphibians live in water, but grownup amphibians can live on land.  a fish cannot live on land.  that's true unless they're a part of a fish tank like me.  well, i'm sorry, but i got to go find somewhere to take these water stains out of this fancy jacket.  bye, everyone. xoxo.  bye, fish.  oh. so let me get this straight.  grownup amphibians can live on land.  oh, yes, and that brings us to tour next clue.  adult amphibians breathe air.  like elmo breathes air with elmo's lungs like this.   only amphibians can also breathe air through their skin.  i didn't know that.  you know, you never know what you might learn from a game show.  ha ha.  now that means we have to look for an animal that breathes air.  and you'd better hurry, amphibian seekers, because our little tadpole's back legs are growing longer, and it's starting to look like a frog.  well, what are abby and elmo waiting for.  .. find that amphibian.  let's go.  ok. come on, come on.  come on, abby.  oh. look, look, look, abby,an animal.  ooh. maybe it'san amphibian.  uh, excuse me.  can't talk, trying toregulate my breathing.  you breathe air.  yeah, and i need a lot ofit for this workout.  hey. oh, oh. adultamphibians breathe air.  ..  we found that amphibian.  yay. yay.   ohh.ohh.  sorry. that isnot an amphibian.  it's not.well, what is it.  tell them what you are.  huh. i'm a bird.  that's right, and birdsare the only species on the planet with feathers.  and mine are gonna need ashower after this workout.  birds also have wings.  oh, and these wingsbetter start flapping.  got to keep the heartrate up, you know.  bye.bye.  and, you know, amphibiansdon't have feathers.  they just have skin, and amphibians don't have wings.  that brings us to our next clue.  oh. what's the clue. what's the clue.  amphibians have 4 legs.  did you hear that, did you hear that.  elmo and abby have to look for something with 4, 4 legs.  yeah. 4 legs. got it.  and you'd better hop to it because that little tadpole now has all 4 of its legs and will soon lose its tail.  tadpoles can grow legsnd lose their tails all by themselves.  why, that's magic.  elmo and abby are running out of time.  ..  find that amphibian.  ok. ok.  let's go this way. ha ha ha.  ha ha ha.   there you go, sir.  your shoes are shined.  eh. right there.  thank you very much, sir.  have a great day.  shoe shine. get your shoes shined.  my horseshoes could use a shine.  ooh. all right, then, sir.  you can start with this one.  ok. i will startwith that one.  and there's this one.  ok. i'll moveon to that one.  and don't forget this one,and last but not least, this one.  let mejust get my chamois here.  elmo, elmo, look.  yeah. it's a horsey.  i know, but how manylegs does it have.  well, let's count them.  all set.  ..1...   ..2...  ooh.  ..3...  ha ha ha.  4.4.  4 legs.  and amphibians have 4 legs.  wait a minute, but isa horsey an amphibian.  well, it does have 4 legs.  ..  we found that amphibian.  yay.   sorry. that isnot an amphibian.  elmo didn't think horseyswere amphibians.  uhuh.  well, what kind ofan animal is a horsey.  tell them what you are.  a horse is a mammal.  mammals areanimals that have hair all over their bodies.  oh, that reminds me.  i've got an appointmentfor a wash and a brush down by the salon.  mammals also look like theirparents when they're born, only smaller.  i was thespitting image of my mama when i was just an ittybitty colt.  well, got to trot. byebye.  hey, hey, what about my tip.  and that leads us to our next clue.  amphibians go through metamorphosis.  metawhosis.  metamorphosis.  that means a big change.  well, how do amphibians change.  well, an amphibian starts out looking one way when it's a baby but then goes through a big change and looks completely different when it's a grownup.  it goes through a metamorphosis just like the baby tadpole.  the tadpole really looks like a frog now.  yep. that's metamorphosis.  our tadpole's made a big change and will soon be a young frog.  oh. oh, no.  then the game will be over.  ..  find that amphibian.  let's go. let's go.  where cani don't know.  oh, i can't find an animal anywhere.  do you see any animals.  do you.  elmo, look, look.  oh. it's an alligator.  do you think hewent through a metamoosha metakisa metamorphosis.  oh, yes. a big change.  well, let's ask him.ok.  excuse me, mr. alligator.  we have a question for you.  uh, ok, but hurry up.  i don't want my turtlelovers' pizza to get cold.  alligator look different when he was a baby.  and change when youbecame a grownup.  i sure did. here'smy baby picture.  that's an egg. oh.  and you're not an egg.  alligatordid go through a big change.  that meansyeah.  we found that amphibian.  yay. ha ha ha. yay.   aw.  sorry. an alligatoris not an amphibian.  oh, boy.  well, what is it.yeah. what is it.  tell them what you are.  alligators are reptiles.  but when he was a baby,he was an egg, and then he went through a big change.  well, he wasn't an egg.  he was inside the egg,and inside the egg, he looked just the way he does now,only smaller.  it's true. here's myjusthatched baby picture.  oh. look.  mr. alligator didn't gothrough a big change.  so sorry. reptiles do notgo through metamorphosis.  i'd love to stayand show you pictures of me through my awkward teen years,but i'm late for lunch.  see you.  bye, mr. alligator.  we didn't find an amphibian.  and you're almost out of time.  huh.  looks like any moment now our tadpole will climb out of the water and be a frog.  elmo and abby will never find the amphibian.  and we tried so hard.  hey, you guys.  chris, chris, chris, chris.  that's wrong.  well, abby and elmo are playing "find the " and we used clues to find different animals, but none of them were amphibians.  oh. well, what clues did you use.  well, the first clue was that baby amphibians live in water, and we found a fish.  nice, nice. anything else.  well, the second clue was amphibians breathe air as adults, and elmo and abby found a bird.  and the third clue was that amphibians have 4 legs, and we found a mammal.  mammal. oh, oh.  well, the fourth clue was amphibians go through a metacatsipaa mitsapoopymetamorphosis.  yes, yes, yes. a big change, a big change.  and elmo and abby found a reptile but no amphibians.  yeah. what are we doing wrong.  what, what, what.  guys, it sounds like you need to put all your clues together.  what you talking about, chris.  heh heh. ok, elmo.  well, it looks like you're finding an animal for each clue but you're forgetting about all the other clues, ok.  you find one animal that fits all your clues, that's your amphibian.  so chris means elmo and abby need to find an animal that lives in the water when it's young, breathes air as an adult, and has 4 legs and go through a metamorphosis.  yes. good job. elmo said it.  so that's what you're trying to say, chris.  you find one animal that fits all those clues, that's your amphibian.  oh, but we'll never find an amphibian now.  the game's almost over.  oh, yeah. that's right.  ahem.  oh. hey, guys.  it looks like an amphibian may be closer than you think.  huh.  wait a minute, abby.  anne phibian is an animal.  yeah. oh, but does she match all the clues.  let's check, let's check, let's check.  see you, guys.  oh.  oh. well, miss anne is breathing air.  yes, i am. yep.  and she does have 4 legs.  let's count them.  ok.  1, 2, 3, 4.  oh.  that's true, too.  what about water.  did miss anne live in water as a baby.  i started out as a tadpole living in water.  that means you must have gone through a big change.  that's right.  i had a metamorphosis and changed into what i am now.  abby, do you know what that means.  ..  found that amphibian.  yes, you did. congratulations. that's right.  i am a newt, and a newt is an amphibian.  you won the "find that amphibian" game and just in time.  whoohoo. ha ha. wow.  that tadpole turned into a frog all by himself just like magic.  aw. thanks for your help, chris.  aw, no problem. congratulations, guys.  and as a prize, you get to boogie down with the amphibian allstar dancers.  yay.

it's not big enough, and it's not comfortable.  you mean, if your bottle was bigger and more comfortable, you'd stay.  sure, but it's impossible.  you can't make my bottle into something else.  maybe
