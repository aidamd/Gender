your wand or your finger, and let's get to it.  what kind of mystical, magical macaroni art can i make.  ooh. i know.  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 sides.  oh. it's a macaroni hexagon.  wait. i changed my mind.  oh. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 sides.  it's now a macaroni octagon.  wait. i changed my mind again.  is she gonna make a macaroni pentagon, a macaroni heptagon, a macaroni tetradecagon.  actually, it's a macaroni horsey. ha ha.  what mystical, magical macaroni art are you going to make, gonnigan.  oh. i already made mine.  it's a bowl of macaroni made completely of macaroni.  eep. eep eep. eep.   eep.  hey. don't eat my art.  it brings down the value.  if you want to see some great mystical, magical macaroni art, then check this out.  it's gonna be big.  it's gonna be huge.  it's gonna be humongous.  whoa.  that is humongous.  what is it.  it's a dinosaur made completely of macaroni.  i call it macaronisaurus.  that is totally cool, blogg.  thank you, but it's not done yet.  i need something to bring it to life.  try glitter glue.  if you ask me, a little glitter glue always adds just the right amount of sparkle.  i was thinking of something a little more spicy.  what. like paprika.  no. this.  ooh.  the spice of life.  but if you put the spice of life on the humongous macaronisaurus, it will come alive.  well, what good is a macaronisaurus if you can't play with it.  if you make a macaronisaurus move from bottom to top, you'd better know how to make the macaronisaurus stop.  don't worry. i got it all under control.  now it's time to spice things up.  oh. i can't watch.  aw. it didn't work.  maybe the spice of life has passed its expiration date.   or maybe not. aah.  come on, macaronisaurus.  let's play some checkers.   maybe he's more of a chess person.  looks like he wants to play dressup.  ok by me.  we'll put on some tutus.   oh, what are we gonna do.  aah. ohh.  don't worry. i'll handle this.   come here, macaronisaurus.  that did not go as well as i hoped.  oh, no. we got to make it stop.  you have to use your noodles to figure this out.  using noodles is what got us into this mess in the first place.  not macaroni noodles, these kinds of noodles.  oh. right.  let's twinkle think.  what makes things stop.  twinkle think, twinkle think, twinkle think.  i know.  dead batteries.  bicycle brakes.  a dancing kumquat wearing a polkadotted mumu.  huh.  that would make me stop.  how about a stop sign.  yeah. st signs make people stop.  let's try a stop sign.  i'll head down to the department of transportation and see if they have any extras lying around.  wait, gonnigan.  we can just make a stop sign.  we need 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 pieces of ..  but that's just an octagon, not a stop sign.  it's the right shape, but there's something missing.  what is it.  this is never going to work.  we might as well just stop.  that's it. we need the word stop.  stop. stop.  stop.   it didn't work.  the macaronisaurus went right through the stop sign.  that's against the law.  eep eep.   eeeeep.  looks like niblet's gonna give him a ticket.  whatever he's doing, it's working.  that little gerbilcorn is stopping that humongous macaronisaurus.  eep eep eep.  hmm.   oh, no. it didn't work.  the flying fairy school is doomed.  take it easy, gonnigan.  keep thinking.  you just need to spot the solution.  that's it. spot.  we need spot's help.  here spot, here, boy.   now we need to find a way to solve the problem and stop a humongous macaroni dinosaur.  fetch, spot, fetch.   ha ha ha.  humongous.  humongous.  humongous.  humongous.  humongous.  we already know the macaronisaurus is humongous.  tell us something we don't know.  wait a minute.  maybe what spot is saying is that we need something humongous to stop something humongous.  now that's a humongous idea.  but what humongous thing do we need.  how about a humongous fence.   ha ha ha.  no, no. a humongous brick wall.   uh, uh, uh, a humongous meatball.  .  mama mia.  that's a humongousa meatball.  let's give it a try.  come on, guys. let's push that meatball.   it's not moving.  we need help.  eee eee eep.  wow.  what's gonna happen.  ha ha ha. ha ha ha.  ohh.  oh, no. it didn't work.  huh.  wait. look. he's stopping.  i can't believe it.  it worked.  we solved the problem. ha ha.  how'd you come up with a humongous meatball.  what goes better with macaroni than meatballs.  ha ha ha.  and it looks like he found something he likes to play with.  great. come on, macaronisaurus.  i'm open.  huh.  unh.  good job, fairies.  ha ha ha.  ha ha ha.

thank you, computer.  elmo's friend kate loves dinosaurs, so her mommy took her to the museum so she could see huge dinosaur bones, and she told elmo all about it.  dinosaurs aren't alive anymore, so you have to go to a museum to see them like the american museum of natural history.  scientists called paleontologists dig up the fossils of dinosaur bones, and they put together skeletons, which show how big they were.  one of the first skeletons we saw was awesome.  it's called a barosaurus.  when i looked up at it, i felt tiny.  it has the longest neck of any dinosaur found in north america.  we found triceratops with 3 big horns and a big collar.  we also saw dinosaur eggs.  how could something as big as a dinosaur grow from something that small.  tyrannosaurs rex.  it h tiny arms and big legs and sharp teeth.  they're sharp because it eats meat.  we found stegosaurus.  i think it's the cutest.  i like the plates on its back.  the last one we saw, the apatosaurus, was humongous, and it was put together from 350 dinosaur bones.  there's a makebelieve skeleton we put together just like paleontologists do.  maybe i'll be a paleontologist someday.  hmm. paleontologist.  paleontologist, paleontologist.  where can elmo learn more about a paleontologist.  oh, ho ho. yeah.  whoa. a tvasaur.  elmo can learn more on the dinosaur channel.  oh. come on, tv.  ha ha. ok. turn yourself on.
