tell me how to get to sesame street.     department of education oh, oh, hi. welcome to sesame street.  ooh, elmo and his friends are just playing tag.  tag. you're it.  no, no, no. elmo is gonna get you.  come back here. come back.  whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. careful, guys.  oh.  these are my class' science experiments.  wow, the kids in gordon's class do science experiments.  well, yeah. yeah.  my students are great scientists.  wait a minute. yeah.  do you mean to tell me that kids can be scientists.  of course. anybody could be a scientist.  even elmo can be a scientist. absolutely.  you just need to be able to ask questions and investigate.  investigate. investigate. investigate.  well, that means that you do things that will help you find the answers to your questions.  well, elmo likes asking questions, ooh, and elmo likes to investigate, too.  yeah, yeah, yeah. me, too. me, 3.  well, that means you can all be scientists.  then let's do it. si.let's be scientists.  yeah.   we're happy to explore    we'll observe that mist    we'll investigate new things    we're happy scientists    we'll ask some happy questions    on answers, we'll insist    we'll learn lots of happy things    we're happy scientists    we're happy, happy, happy, happy, happy scientists   ok, gordon.  what can the happy scientists investigate.  well, just look around and see if there's anything on sesame street that you might have questions about.  ok. ok. ok.  does anybody have any questions about street signs.  nah. no. uhuh. no.  hmm, anyone have any questions about a mailbox.  ha ha. no. uhuh. ha ha ha.  oh. oh, look. look at that.  leela is giving barkley a bath.  hey, maybe we can ask a question about dogs.  or baths.  ooh, elmo just thought of a question.  oh, what is it, elmo.  well, the question is, does everyone on sesame street take a bath.  great question. thank you.  what should the happy scientists do next, gordon.  well, next, you come up with a hypothesis.  hypopotamus. no, no, no, no. hypothesis.  it means a guess based on what you already know.  oh. oh. oh.   we'll take a happy guess called a hypothesis    that is what you do when you're a happy scientist    we're happy, happy, happy, happy, happy scientists   ok. so what does elmo know.  elmo and all his friends take baths, right.  right. right.  and gordon takes a bath, right.  i do. mmhmm. good.  hmm, so elmo guesses that everyone on sesame street does take a bath.  ok. then that is your hypothesis, elmo.  and that is my hyhypothesis.  hypothesis, tooeveryone takes a bath.  ok. now, what about you, telly.  i'm not so sure that everybody takes a bath, so i'll say no.  i don't think everyone on sesame street takes a bath.  so now you have to test your hypothesis and find the answer.  but, gordon, how do the happy scientists do that.  you investigate and put everything you find out in a journal.  oh. like this. ha ha ha.  oh. oh. ha ha ha.   we'll draw some happy pictures    we'll make a happy list    we'll keep a happy journal    we're happy scientists    the happy, happy, happy, happy, happy scientists   come on, happy scientists.  let's investigate and find out if everyone on sesame street takes a bath.  investigate. investigate. investigate.  ha ha ha.  investiguh, telly. telly.  what. agh. ha ha.  well, those are some happy scientists.    ooh, ooh, rubber duck  aah.  hi, chris. hi, chris. hi, chris.  uh, what are you guys doing in my bathroom.  we're watching you, chris. mmhmm.  watching me. mmhmm.  why.  well, all in the name of science, chris.  elmo, telly, and rosita are scientists.  well, can you scientists hurry this up.  i'm kind of in the middle of something.  hey, look. he is in the middle of something.  chris is in the middle of a bathtub.  yes, yes, and he's got sudsy bubbles all over him.  scientist elmo thinks chris takespbbta bath.  yes. yes.  oh. that's right guys. yes. i take a bath.  now can i please get some privacy.  in a second, chris. in a second.  first, we have to draw a picture of you in the tub.  a picture of me. mmhmm. yes.  like this. oh, yes.  si.in the name of science, chris.  oh, fine, but hurry it up before all my bubbles pop.   chris thinks about it, now he's on our happy list    we're investigating it, we're the happy scientists    the happy, happy, happy, happy, happy scientists   let's go investigate some more.  investigate. investigate. investigate.  ..  bye, chris. oh.  i really got to put a lock on that bathroom door. uh.  uh, what you staring at.  ooh, ooh, don't mind us, kitty.  we're scientists. yeah.  oh, well, if you're scientists, i guess it's ok.  thank you.  ew, it's licking its foot.  hmm. oh, good investigating, telly.  thank you, but why is it licking its foot.  that's just gross.  well, it looks like it's cleaning itself.  no. with its tongue. no way.  well, yeah.  maybe this is the way that the cat takes a bath.  oh, no, no, no. it can't be.  actually, the cute, little, red scientist is right.  i am, in fact, taking a bath.  with your tongue. yep.  it's how we cats keep clean.  now, can you stop watching me while i bathe.  it's kind of freaking my kibbles out.  oh,si, senor gato, as soon as we do this.  we draw your picture, right, telly.  yep. yep. i got it. i got it. i got it.  and as soon as we do this. hit it.   cats take a tongue bath, we'll add it to our list    we're finding out so many things,    we're happy scientists    we're happy, happy, happy, happy, happy scientists   let's keep investigating.  investigating. investigating. investigating.  now, if you'll excuse me, i'm trying to take my bath.  i'm sure it's look, happy scientists. a sparrow.  the sparrow is flapping around in the dust.   i wonder why he's doing that.  all i know is that a bird who rolls in dust like that couldn't possibly be a bird who takes a bath, so my hypothesis is correct.  not everyone on sesame street takes a bath.  no, you are not.  how could you be taking a bath without water.  it's called a dust bath. a dust bath.  you can't take a bath in dust.  well, if you're a sparrow, you can.  the dust really helps keep my feathers and skin clean.  oh, you know what that means.  ..  and sing. hit it.   sparrows take dust baths, it's added to our list    it pays to observe when you're a happy scientist    the happy, happy, happy, happy, happy scientists   there's got to be something around here that doesn't take a bath.  aha. come on over here, guys.  i think i see just the thing. ha ha ha. yes.  oh, look. a owl.  i thought owls only came out at night.  well, what's he doing out in the day.  whatever it's doing, it's not taking a bath.  yes, i am. oh, you've got to be kidding.  nope. i'm taking a sun bath. a sun bath.  the sun can't give you a bath.  if you're an owl, it can.  the sun helps get rid of some germs that may be stuck in my feathers.  mmhmm all right. eh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  sing. hit it.   owls take sun baths, we'll add it to our list    we're happy, happy, happy, happy, happy scientists   happy.  it looks like elmo and rosita's hypothesis is right.  everybody on sesame street takes a bath.  mmhmm. i am not giving up yet.  i just thought of someone who couldn't possibly take a bath.  ha ha ha.  oscar. oscar. oscar.  why is telly calling to oscar.  because oscar is a grouch and he loves everything dirty and dingy and grungy and there's no way that oscar takes a bath.  oscar. oscar. oh.  i'm trying to take a bath.  grouches take baths.  yes. we take mud baths.  oh, no.  oh, yes, so leave me alone so i can wallow ..  grouches take baths.  oh, let's draw and sing. hit it.   grouches take a mud bath, we'll add it to our list   stop. stop. stop the music. oh, stop it.  doesn't telly want to sing the happy scientist song.  no. well, why not.  i'm not a happy scientist.  i'm a mad scientist, mad, i tell you.  i'm a mad, mad, mad, unhappy scientist.  not happy, not happy.  telly, what are you so mad about.  i couldn't find anyone on sesame street that didn't take a bath.  i can't be a scientist, gordon.  well, of course you can, telly.  but my hypothesis was all wrong.  but, telly, it's ok to be wrong in science.  it is. yeah.  you see, the important thing in science is the process.  huh. yeah, process.  it's all the steps that you take to find an answer.  like asking questions. and investigating.  and writing down what we find in the journal.  all of those things are part of the scientific process.  well, we did all that stuff.  oh, ok, and what did you find out.  show him. well, here.  i wrote it down in my journal. i drew pictures.  ..  ok.  ..  wow.  and we found out that little sparrows take ..  all right.  and owls take sun baths, and we even found out that grouches take mud baths.  wow, those are some really interesting things you guys learned.  really. absolutely.  through investigating, you guys found out things i didn't even know.  ..  and now that you've learned all this great stuff, what do you think the answer to the question is.  does everybody on sesame street take a bath.  i think the answer is yes.  everyone on sesame street does take a bath, just not all in the same way.  great job. you guys did it.  we did it. we did it. we did it.  congratulations, scientists.  we're happy scientists.  yeah. hit it. yay.   we're the happy, happy, happy, happy    happy scientists   i love science.   hi. i'm wanda. ooh, and elmo is elmo.  and we're here to tell you about the word " " tell them what a journal is, little e.  well, miss wanda, elmo not

class, i lay down on my mat and take deep breaths, just like madi.  she puts a little paper boat on my tummy so i can watch it move up and down as i breathe, just like a boat on the ocean.  when class is finished, i say goodbye to madi and go see my mom.  she always has a bottle of water for me.  she says it's important to drink water when you exercise.  when i grow up, i want to be a yoga teacher

first, we rinse her legs with warm water so she could get used to it.  we slowly move the hose up to her neck and get her whole body wet, but not the face.  then my mom showed me how to wash her with shampoo and a sponge.  we washed her neck, her back, underneath her, and we were careful with her legs, and we washed her mane, too.  it's kind of like washing your hair.  then came the tail.  after that, we rinsed her all over with some more warm water.  we have to be very gentle.  we use warm water and a special face sponge, but no shampoo.  it was time to dry her, so we scraped the water off with a scraper.  then we used a towel to dry her off some ..   but she was still a little wet, so we walked her around for a while and let the sun dry her the rest of the way.  sarah was very shiny.  i love my horse, but sometimes she rolls in the dirt.  oh, no.  we'll have to start all over again.  boy, juliana's horse sarah must really love taking baths, ooh, but now elmo wants to learn even
