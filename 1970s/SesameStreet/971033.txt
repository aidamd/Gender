woods, papa bear.  we're in school.  you should know that.  you went to school.  actually, son, i never went to school.  you never went to school.  you see, when i was your age, bears didn't go to school.  we learned everything we needed to know in the woods.  we scavenged for our food, and when we wanted something, well, all we had to do was growl.  grrrrr.  aah. no.  peter piper'spositively petrified.  papa bear, school is different than home.  there's no scavenging, and there's no bear hugs, and there's definitely no growling.  you see, mr. papa bear, let me try to explain.   thereereereere's    no growling in preschool    that's a rule you can't ignore    there's no growling in preschool    you're not in the woods anymore    at school, we raise your hands    yes    at school, we all take turns    uhhuh    we never grunt or grab or growl    so everybody learns    there's no growling in preschool     grr.   no, there's no growling in preschool    you're not in the woods anymore    at school when there's a problem    we try to work it out   aw.   we never push or poke or pals    yes, that's what school's about    there's no growling in preschool    that's a rule you've heard before    i just sang it    there's no growling    or grunting    or graaabbing    you're not in the woods anymore   thank you.  now do you understand, papa bear.  there are things that we do at home that we don't do in school.  i understand.  i think i better just go home.  wait. you can't go home, papa bear.  but, son, i don't want to embarrass you.  well, you won't, papa bear.  when i first came to school, i didn't know the rules either.  he used to growl all the time.  yeah, and then i learned to control myself.  now i hardly ever growl.  please stay, papa bear.  we don't want you to go.  papa bear, i need your help with story time.  you do.  i would like you to read one of our favorite stories.  ooh. sure. which one.  it's the story of the 3 bears.  ohh. that's my
