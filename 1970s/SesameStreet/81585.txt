 et us a ticket at we'll travel the world in sunshine and rain and meet all the ..    dinosaur train     dinosaur train     dinosaur train     dinosaur train     we're gonna ride     ride, ride, ride, ride      the dinosaur train        i can jump all day.   and i could tweak my beak.  honk.   and i could hoot a hoot.     yep, nothing's better than a play date at corythosaurus canyon.   with our musical pal cory.     yes, yes, we're all very excited, but since i'm pretending to be your mom for the day, i say don't get too you'll be too tired to enjoy our play date.  we just rolled out of the nest.   huh.     there's the dinosaur train.  line up singlefile, oldest to youngest. that means me first.   i think i might be the oldest by just a little.  the pteranodon family is present and ready for a play date. psst.     i'm playing mom today.  you're doing a wonderful kids, let's head to the dinosaur train.   yay.   whoo.   left, right, left, right, left , right, left, then look straight, ..   shiny really likes playing mom.  she's really good at it.    take your seats, everyone.  tiny, sit down.   we never had to do any of this stuff on the dinosaur train before.  now that i am, you should listen to me and do what i say.   hmm.   tickets. tickets, please.  puts a song in my heart just to say you know, the hadrosaurs that live in that part of the cretaceousconductor, but this is my second trip to corythosaurus canyon, so i know all about it.   yyou do.  i learned all there is to learn about cory on our last trip. may i.   well, heh.   this is a corythosaurus, and this is their crest.   shiny's pretending to be mom today.   only way more strict.  well, she seems to be doing my explaining job.  our friend cory corythosaurus makes beautiful music with her crest.   that's right, and cory uses her crest to communicate with now, question, miss shiny: is cory a hadrosaur.   um, yes, i'm pretty sure.  yeah, cory's a hadrosaur.   i knew it.   and isn't "hadrosaur" the name for all dinosaurs that have those duck bills.  you know the hadro buddy, don't interrupt.   ahem.   as i was saying, hadrosaur is the name for all dinosaurs with duck bills.   and they walk on two legs.   do they all make music like cory.  if other hadrosaurs have longer or shorter crests than corythosaurus, they might make different sounds.  interesting hypothesis, buddy.   i was just going to say that.    i'm still mom.   are you going to be mom forever.   actually, shiny, momthat's mewould like to be mom again.   ding. ding.   thank you for your hadrosaur lesson.   i could go on.   no, thank you.   speaking of hadrosaurs, we're getting closer to seeing them ..  time tunnel.  time tunnel.   next stop, corythosaurus canyon, in another part of the cretaceous time period.   oh, i'm glad you kids could cory's playing by the amphitheater.   thank you, we'll keep a lookout.   and a listen out.        cory.  it's so great you came to have a play date with me.   so, want to play a game.   actually, since we're visiting cory, i say we play music.   yay.   i've got it all worked out.  cory, you will toot and hoot, using your crest.      and team pteranodon will pound on things to keep the beat.  a rapping beat that makes me dance.     don, no dancing and no just tap that small rock with this stick.  keep the beat.     buddy, tiny, you pound these sticks on this rock and this hollow log.    ready to do as i say and have a good time.   ahem.   yes.  aone, atwo, aone, two, three.      cory, you sound great, and you guys are keeping a really good beat.    stop, who made that weird sound.   not me.   let's try again. ready.  aone, atwo, aonetwo     where is that coming from.  i guess we're playing hide 'n' hoot after all.     up there. look.  it sounded hot.   perry, come down and meet my other friends.  perry parasaurolophus, meet buddy, tiny, shiny, and don.  perry's my name, music's my game.   and i bet you use your up and wn.   cory, can we hear your hoot again so we can compare it to perry's.      my hypothesis was longer crests make different sounds. they're lower.   right, buddy. check this out.  i know something we can all do.  let's jam.   huh.   hmm.  ..   huh.   that means "let's play "  oh. we love music.   and dancing.  hoot.   you can dance to our song.  aone, twoi happen to i already gave don a job.   a job. we have jobs.   you follow my lead like aone, atwo, aone, two, three.    stop. everybody stop.   what's the matter, shiny.   yeah. we were sounding hot.   perry's crest is too loud, and he wasn't playing along with our song.   i was improvising.   huh.  it means there's no right or wrong play what you feel.   that sounds really silly.   your way is fine, but maybe we could try a new way to play.   i already guys, music brings dinosaurs i just know we can find a way to play as a group.   sounds good to me.   but that's not what i i think maybe i'll go see what the grownups are doing.    there goes our play date.   ah. that's too bad, shiny.  you had an important part to play.   important.  see, with improvisation, we all have to be here to make music.   we're doing it together.   and we can't all do it if you're not here, shiny.   hmm.   i think you're a real star, waiting to shine bright.  well, they don't call me shiny for nothing. let's jam.     yeah.   way to shine, shiny.  i'm having so much fun. i don't want to stop.  before we go home, let's put on a concert for our moms.   yeah. a concert. let's do it.     i used to play straight up and neat i used to walk to the same old beat i didn't know what i was missing oh, would you all listen.  now the music i play is sweet.  i like to sing so free like the bebopping birdies at the top of the tree i've found a new way to sing a song bop bop bop bop hear the bees in the trees and i breeze along with them i play and sway to the looseygoosey rhythm i've found a new way to sing a song boo doo doo doo ba da i thought there was one way to play but perry showed me a brandnew way now i'm really swinging the song is really ringing you can hear me sing all day 'cause i like to sing so free like the bebopping birdies at the top of the tree i've found a new way to sing a song ba da   listen up, guys. i got wise.   i learned the way to improvise i like to sing so free like the bebopping birdies at the top of the tree i've found a new way to sing a song    ha ha ha. that was wonderful.    hey, who made that funnysounding note.   you mean the train whistle.   oops. that's the note.    good one, shiny.  it was great to meet perry and learn about hadrosaurs.     yes, it was a great day.  time for sleep.   'night, mom.    good night pteranodon family      and shh.  scott, the and this is parasaurolophus.   parasaurolophus.   parasaurolophus.   parasaurolophus.   parasaurolophus.  parasaurolophus had one outstanding feature that's hard to miss.   its crest.   yeah, the head crest on parasaurolophus is amazing.  paleontologists aren't sure, but we think that the crest may have been used to make the animal look bigger and to make sounds.  much like bird calls, parasaurolophus probably made sounds to communicate with the hooting could have been used to defend territory.   this is my territory.   or tell other animals of approaching predators.   there's a tyrannosaur over there.   or simply let other parasaurolophus know where to find them.   yo, i'm way over here.   other dinosaurs besides parasaurolophus had bony crests on their heads, like and some animals alive today have head crests that you definitely can't miss.  for example, the crested it doesn't make sounds with its head crest, but it certainly attracts attention.   hello, hello, hello.   goodlooking guy, huh.  ok, remember, keep watching for more dinosaur discoveries.   buddy has a hypothesis.  what do you use your feathers for.   i have a hypothesis.  i have a hypothesis.  i have a new hypothesis to test out.  tiny, i have a hypothesis.   you mean an idea you can test.  i think you guys are faster because your legs are longer.  so i have a hypothesis.   but how can we test that.   it was an interesting hypothesis.   buddy really likes the word it means an idea you can test.    all aboard, all aboard let's take a ride on the dinosaur train here she comes right on time the dinosaur train's coming down the line    all aboard. all aboard.    rattle and bang rumble and xxx she's huffin' and apuffin' like a

whoo.   scott, the can you name this animal.   where is it.   well, it's right down there.   i don't see it.   in front of you.   i can see it. it's a beetle.  beetles are some of the most amazing and successful creatures of all millions of different kinds of beetles live all over the earth today, and millions more lived alongside the some beetles are pretty big and some are some live in trees or water, others in caves or some beetles eat potatoes and others eat poop.  all beetles can crawl around, and fireflies are beetles that flash a light from their body.  so the next time you see one of these amazing little creatures, think about all those beetles that lived alongside the dinosaurs millions of years ago.  ok, get outside, get into nature, and make your own beetle discoveries.   did you know that the dinosaur train travels everywhere in the mesozoic era.  there was the triassic, jurassic, and let's many new kinds of flowers and insects the most dinosaurs, like tyrannosaurus rex and flying creatures like pteranodons, and that's just one of the stops on the dinosaur train.   time for a tiny ditty.   being a big dino might be cool but how about us little ones.  i think we rule.  we've got the power we got the power we got the mighty    we love playing games.   like pteranodon fishing.   you can play, too.   all right.   at pbskids.org.   there's lots of other games.   there's so much to learn about all kinds of dinosaurs.   go to pbskids.org.     dinosaur train dinosaur train     dinosaur train dinosaur train we're gonna ride the dinosaur train     dinosaur train
