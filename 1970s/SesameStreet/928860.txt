are you ready for a brandnew day ofgaseous gargoyles.  what is that smell.  ohh. it sure is stinky.  oh. p.u.  p.u. indeed.  where is it coming from.  blogg's backpack.  aw. i was gonna save it for showandsmell.  uh, blogg, what do you have in there.  only my favorite, most cuddly thing in the whole world.  aw, blogg. you have a lovey.  no. i have a schlubby.  ohh. yech.  bawk bawk bawk.   ohh.  your favorite thing is a dirty, yucky, stinky, old sock.  isn't it great.  i've worked hard to get schlubby like this.  you made it like that on purpose.  i use schlubby to mop up pickle juice, carry my rotten cheese, and occasionally to wick away moisture from my sweaty feet.  but how can you stand the stink.  ewwww.   ohh. it's like a party in my nostrils.  blogg, if that sock gets any dirtier, it's going to walk away on its own.  what are you talking about.  that will never happen.  come on, schlubby.  let's go make someud pie no, not the magic mu aah.  my schlubby, it's alive.  it's alive.  but how.  magic mud is messy business.  this could be a nightmare.  or a dream come true.  now we can really be best friends.  come here, schlubby.  give me a hug.  huh. schlubby.  come on.  what's the matter.  don't you know me, schlubby.  come back here.  we'll help you get it back, blogg.  let's catch that sock.  gotcha.  ohh.  what happened to me.  eww.  eww. you're as filthy as that sock.  ugh.  and i smell like it, too.  lucky.  bawk bawk bawk.   bawk bawww.  i think that magic mud gave schlubby magic powers.  whatever schlubby touches turns, well, disgusting, no offense, abby dear.  i can't even stand the smell of me.  somebody do something.  aah. don't let it touch you.  look out.   eep, eep.  huh. huh.  eep. p.u.  ahh.  that sock is going to make the whole classroom filthy.  i've got to get clean again.  and i've got to get my schlubby back to the way he was.  i can't cuddle with a sock on the run.  the only way is to wash the magic mud off that sock.  wash schlubby.  yes, blogg. i'm afraid so.  i never thought it would come to this, but if it means getting my schlubby back, ok, i will wash it.  but how can you wash it if you can't catch it.  sounds like you could use a twinkle think.  i'd love to, but all i can do right now is twinkle stink.  looks like i got to do all the thinking around here.  let's see. how do you wash something.  twinkle think, twinkle think, twinkle think.  ooh. i know.  my aunt schmolga's cat washes herse with her tongue.  hey. i've got a tongue.  come here, schlubby, and i'll lick you clean.  aah, aah.   bawk.  bawk bawk bawk bawk.  bawk bawk bawk.  tastes like chicken.  that sock moves too fast.  plus if you touch it, you turn all stinky.  it appears we need another way to wash your schlubby, blogg.  ok, but i'm afraid licking is the extent of my washing knowledge. )
