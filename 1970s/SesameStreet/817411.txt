serious sigh.  what's wrong.  gina's too busy with marco to play checkers.  i know that feeling.  i have experience in that department.  you do.  before curly was born, we were the 3 bears.  we did everything together.  when curly came along, my parents were busy with her all the time.  babies need grownups for everything.  curly needed to be carried and fed, washed and dressed.  mama and papa did not have much time for me.  what happened.  she grew.  she did things for herself.  she does not need my parents attention every second.  like marco needs gina's attention.  i got used to curly.  i could teach her things: how to play with toys, draw pictures, do cartwheels.  being with curly was fun.  she got bigger, and we had more fun.  she is more a friend than a sister.  marco will get bigger, too.  you will have a friend.  play. play.  she loves to play.  tag.  i am coming.  see you later.  bye, baby bear.  marco will get bigger.  elmo wants to play checkers now.  you have to be a baby to get gina's attention.  that was yummy.  goo goo ga ga.  goo goo goo goo.  marco, it's a baby.  cootchie cootchie coo.  goo goo goo goo.  how adorable.  too bad elmo's not here.  i wanted to play checkers.  babies can't play, just big kids.  we can't play. too bad.  wait. elmo's here.  you are not a baby.  elmo's elmo.  we can play checkers.  let's play.  let me just put marco down.  you want to play checkers with elmo.  of course i do.  ok, there.  marco is just a baby.  i love him, but i still love you.  you have enough love for marco and elmo.  you do not run out of love.  i have enough for you both.  we used to play every day    now it seems like hardly ever    sometimes what you might have planned    might have to wait till later   gina.   but i've got enough love to go around    love is something i never can run out of    time for us together    always will be found    i've got enough love to go around   are you sure.  yes.   just because i'm busy now    doesn't mean i will be later    maybe elmo understands    and elmo feels a little better   ha ha ha.   because we've got enough love to go around    love is something we never can run out of    time for us

time just for you.  marco won't be a baby forever.  he will get bigger.  when he's older, we can play and be friends.  he needs to learn things.  elmo could teach marco to sing and count.  and play checkers.  elmo can teach marco now.  are you ready to play.  yes.  watch carefully.  these are checkers.  you move them like this.  watch carefully.  this is a checkers expert.  sometimes you move
