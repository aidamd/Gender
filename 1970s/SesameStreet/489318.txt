 ha ha.  wheeha.  ha ha.  hello. welcome to flying fairy school.  let's see what's growing in the science center.  looks like abby is growing some wildflowers.   mmm. oh.   and blogg is using sunlight to grow sunflowers.  nnn. eep. eep.  hmm. i wonder what peck could be growing.   an eggplant. of course.  ..  ..    ..  absolutely nothing.  i've used water, i've used sunlight, i've even used a chicken, and i can't grow anything.  just give it time, gonnigan.  you also need patience when you're growing a seed.  it's no use.  i'll never grow anything.  why don't you just use a spell.  hey. yeah.  maybe i could try a spell, a big spell.  or a huge spell.  nah. what you need is a gigantic spell.  oh. that's really big.  i'll try. gigantic, gigantic, gigantic.  hee hee hee. eep eep eep.  oh, no. i can't grow anything.  snee.  ohh. eep.  or maybe i can.   ooh. eep.   sweet sparkling pixie puffs.  that is one gigantic plant.  it worked. i did it. i did it.  look look, peck.  uh, peck.  um, peck.  where are you, peck.   oh. i think she's up there.  oh, no. i sent peck all the way up there.  how are we gonna get her down.  how are we gonna figure this out.  what are we gonna do.  settle down now.  this isn't the first time a chicken's been sent hurtling up through the roof in this classroom, and i'm sure it won't be the last.  besides, i can get her down. no worries.  going up.   going up.   up.  perhaps you can think of another way to the top.  we have wings. we can fly.  oh, no. i've never flown that high before.  um, how about a magic rhyme to go from the bottom all the way to the top.  looks like we need the bottomtotop rhyme.  ready. ok.  pork chop, bunny hop, pop, pop, pop.  take us from the bottom up to the top.  whoa.  i'll be down here at the bottom if you need me.  whoa.  all right, fairies,let's find that chicken.  maybe we should just stayhere till it clears up a bit.  a few cumulus clouds never hurt anybody.  ow.  must have hit a tree or something.  i don't think that's a tree.  what is it.  i'd say those were size 85 hightops.  oh. size 85 hightops.  .  ooh. that can only mean one thing.  yeah. big socks.  no.  big giant.  mrs. sparklenose, there's a giant up here.  oh, how wonderful.  it's not every day you get to meet a real live giant, you know, and don't worry, fairies.  giants are very easy to talk to once you figure out how.  i am so never gonna do that gigantic spell ever again.   do you hear that.  ..  peck.  that giant is using peck as a feather duster.  what do we do.  i know what to do.  stop, mr. giant.  or don't. your choice.  whoa.  mrs. sparklenose.  sounds like you fairies just need to spot the solution.  aah.  we need spot's help to figure this out.  uh, here, spot.  over here, spot.  whoa.   how can werescue peck from the giant.  fetch, spot, fetch.        what do ears have to do with anything.  let's twinkle think.  twinkle think, twinkle think, twinkle think.  i got it.  you can make ear wax with them.  ooh. it looks like elvis.  that's a keeper.   you can also use ears to hear.  but we already tried talking to the giant, and he can't hear us at all.  maybe it's because we're too far from his ears.  hey, yeah. we got to get nearer his ears.  come on. let's climb his shins.  going up.   going up.  um, i have another idea.  gonnigan, you need to try your gigantic spell again.  what. why.  because if we're gigantic, we'll be as big as him, and he'll be able to hear us.  no way. you saw what happened last time.  but we have to save peck.  oh. ok, for peck.  let me know how it all turns out.  gigantic, gigantic, gigantic.  whoa.  huh.  gigantic pixie people.  where did you come from.  ohh.  um, we're from the bottom of the beanstalk, and we're here to tell you that that's not a feather duster.  it's a fairy chicken named peck.   that is a feather duster.  oh. it's beautiful and giantsized.  i love it.  thank you, teeny, tiny, little feather duster that turned out to be a teeny, tiny, little chicken.  ha ha ha.  oh, ha ha.   la la la la   the perfect solution.  now all fairies, come on back.  it's time for a fairy graham cracker snack.   peck thanks us all for helping her not to be a feather duster.  you, too. now graham crackers for everyone.   oh, no. it's another giant.  .  ohh.  i believe he's been eating a little too much gigantic beanstalk.   eep eep eep.  ohh.  hee hee. eep eep.  eep eep eep eep.   it's time to get up    and stomp your feet    to this great footstompingtransylvanian beat    start nice and slow    1, 2    then speed up more    1, 2, 3, 4    then
