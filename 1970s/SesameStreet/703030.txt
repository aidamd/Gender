sting me.  baby bear, that bee's not interested in you.  see, it's checking out the flower.  and it's gone.  there it goes.   my wee, little palpitating heart.  ooh.  baby bear, i didn't know you were afraid of bees.  are you kidding.  they terrify me with those stingers and that buzzing and everything.   but bees our friends.  friends. noooo way, sister.  nothing that can sting is a friend of mine.  but, baby bear, bees only sting when they're in danger, to protect themselves.  if you leave bees alone, they'll usually leave you alone.  yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  i've heard all the usual bee propaganda before.  i wish i weren't afraid of bees, but i am, ok.  oh, well, maybe i can grant that wish.  huh.  well, maybe i can do a magic spell and make you not afraid of bees.  yeah. yeah.  that would be great, abby.  abby, abby, have ever done a spell like this before.  well, no, but there's a first time for everything.  yeah, yeah, yeah. that's not a good idea.  i just need a good rhyme.  oh. i've got it. don't do this.  make him not afraid of bees, please.  oh. what the.  oh, no. where'd they go.  whoa.  what happened.  we'rewe're bees.  we'rewe're bees.  .  .  this is not an oops situation.  ok. we have wings, we have stingers.  watch where you point that thing.  i'm sorry, guys.  i could just do another spell and turn you back.  good.  if i only knew one.  you don't know how to fix this.  i, uh, well, i'm a fairy in training, and, well, i have a plan "b".  we don't need a plan "b".  we need a plan not a bee.  well, that's what i mean.  i'll just call my mommy on my cellular wand.  she'll know what to do.  oh. no bars.  huh. i got to get another network.  hurry, abby.   hey, you.  aah.  a bee.  don't sting me.  please don't sting me.  sting you.  why would i sting you.  i don't sting unless i'm in danger.  oh. hey. what did i tell you.  now come on, bees.  what, are you on a sugar water break.  get your abdomens in gear.  we've got work to do.  work.  yeah. we're worker bees, aren't we.  worker bees work.  uh, actually, the thing is we're not bees.  that'sha ha. very funny.  i'm laughing my thorax off.  there's a whole field of flowers over there, and they ain't gonna pollinate themselves, so let's go, let's go, let's go.  butbutbutaw, quit your droning and move.  ohh.  abby, sweetie, got to fix this, ok.  i'm on it, chris.   all right, bees.  let's get busy.  uh, i keep telling you we are not bees.  enough with the jokes there, funny bug, and get to work on these flowers.  but we don't even know what we're supposed to do.  what are you, new here.  uh, yes.  why do i always get the newbies.  ok. i'll make this simple.  flowers have two things we bees want, nectar, which is the sweet liquid inside the flower, and pollen.  did you just say pollen.  yeah. it's this powdery stuff here.  check it out.  oh, boy.  uh, baby bear, i'm allergic to pollen.  what.  because pollen makes memakes you what.  what. what.  sneeze. what.  ahchoohoohoo.  a bee allergic to pollen.  some days, i wish i were an earthworm.  excuse me, sir, but what exactly do we bees with all the pollen.  what do we do.  ahchoohoohoo.  you are giving me such an antenna ache.  listen, pupa, we bees help the flowers.  hang on a second.  how do bees help flowers.  you're kidding me, right.  we bees take the pollen from flowers, and we spread it around to make more flowers.  this is bee 101, kid.  wow. bees help flowers grow.  not just flowers.  bees also help plants, fruits, and vegetables to grow.  if it weren't for us bees, there'd be none of those things.  now, come on. get to work.  wow. i had no idea bees were so important.  ahahbaby bear.  yeah.  i got to get away from all this pollen.  it's gonna make me sneeze.  well, maybe abby's figured out how to turn us back into ourselves by now.  i hope so.  yeah. me, too. uhoh.  ahahahoohthank you.  ahchoo.   abby. abby.  there you guys are.  please tell me you found a way to undo this.  well, not yet.  you see, i'm having some trouble getting through on my cellular wand.  this friends and fairies plan is the worst.  hey, newbies, where'd you buzz off to.  we got a lot more work to do.  i didn't get your name, but whatever it is, we're not actually bees.  so maybe you're not so good at the whole pollenspreading thing, but that doesn't make you any less of a bee.  no more bumbling around.  we got work to do.  now move, move, move.  ohh.  abby.  you need to get ahold of your mama.  fast.  mommy, can you hear me now.  all right, bees. get to work.  man, oh, man, he's bossy.  yeah.  hey, chris. huh.  where are we.  i don't know.  and what are all those funny shapes.  uh, i'm not sure.  why don't we count how many sides.  yeah, yeah, yeah. ok.  ..  ..  ..  4, 5, 6.  ok. 6 sides.  that's a hexagon.  oh. a hexagon.  boy, there sure are a lot of hexagons around here.  oh, boy. uh, baby bear.  what.  i think i figured out where we are.  where.  we're in a beehive.  . uhhuh.  a beehive. yeah.  isn't it like a big rule never to mess with the beehive.  it's the biggest rule.  ok. ok. keep it together, ok.  i'm gonna figure out a way to get out of here, like an exit or something. hey.  why aren't you newbies making hexagons.  because we're not bees.  we don't even know how to make those hexagon thingies.  well, you just make some wax and form it into a shape with 6 sides.  every bee knows that. yeesh.  keep telling you we're not bees.  he's not listening.  where's an exit.  hold on a sec.  what did he mean, "make some wax".  well, bees make wax, you know.  isn't there a backdoor, something out of here.  you mean, like, wax wax, like, the stuff candles are made out of, that wax.  beeswax is used to make all kinds of things.  let's see. candles, soap.  crayons.  hold the phone.  you mean, like, my crayons, the ones i use to create my art, the expression of my soul, could be .  yeah, yep, yes, they are, baby bear.  i mean, isn't there, like, a trapdoor or an emergency exit.  that is so cool.  hey. oh.  why am i not surprised to see that you newbies aren't making wax.  can't make wax. not bees.  forget the flowers, forget the wax.  i think the only career path for you two might be in honey.  . yeah.  did you say honey.  of course. honey.  what do bees have to do with honey.  oh. you have got to be kidding me.  this is where honey comes from.  we make honey.  you make honey.  honey is, like, one of my basic food groups.  i eat it all the time.  i never knew bees made honey.  how could you not know bees make honey.  you know, i'm beginning to think you guys might not be bees.  thank you.  well, i got to say, i think i was all wrong about bees.  you're not scary at all.  you're amazing. you're terrific.  you're stupendous.  aw, go on.  no. please go on.  bee, boss bee person thingy, we're happy that you're a bee and all, we love bees, but we got to get back to our regular selves, so can you show me the exit.  straight down.  oh. look at that. thank you.  you know, i just want to stay thank you, thank you for the flowers and the vegetables and crayons and the honey.  baby bear. yes. right. byebye.  bye.  those were two of the weirdest insects i ever met.  i'm gonna miss them.   ah. oh. oh, dear. where could they be.  did somebody say, "bee".  yo, abby.  there you guys are.  i poofed myself home to talk to my mommy in person, and she told me how to undo the spell and turn you back into yourselves.  ah. ha ha ha.  oh, thank goodness.  yes. give me some, give me some.  yeah.  i can't believe how easy this new spell is.  oh, great.  lay it on us.  ok. here goes.  ahem.  make them not bees, please.  hey. two arms, no wings.  it worked. thank you, abby.  it is so good to be my old bear self again.  whathey.  hello, there, little bee.  welcome. come. enjoy these lovely flowers.  yes. that's it.  drink up.  yeah.  drink the sweet nectar of life.  butbut, baby bear, aren't you scared.  of a bee. nah.  there's nothing to be scared of.  bees are incredible, and, you know, it really is true.  if you leave them alone, they'll usually leave you alone.  mmhmm. well, all right.  abby, i guess your little spell to make baby bear not afraid of bees actually worked.  i guess.  now if you two will excuse me, i've got a bit of unfinished drawing to attend to.  there's something very important missing from this here picture.  let's see. yeah.   beeutiful.  i'm nancy o'dell here with a flower to "  hello   now tell us, flower, what does the word pollinate mean.  pollinate. pollinate.  i have no idea.  ok. i wasn't

it's not big enough, and it's not comfortable.  you mean, if your bottle was bigger and more comfortable, you'd stay.  sure, but it's impossible.  you can't make my bottle into something else.  maybe we can.  let's twinkle think.  how could we change the genie's bottle.  twinkle think, twinkle think.  hmm. let's see.  we want to take something that's old and ..  and make it into something new that can be used again.  wait a minute.  ohh.  that is recycling.  yeah. recycling.  rewhatcling.  we can change your old bottle into something new again, but first, you have to get mrs.  sparklenose out.  oh, all right, but only because i'm intrigued.  kazoomba.  ohh. thank you.  a fairy needs to fly and fly free.  we better hurry and recycle before that bottle sucks someone else inside.  gonnigan,

bert. oh, bert.  ha ha ha.  oh. thanks, computer.  boy, elmo loves finding out about skin.  elmo's friend elaine learned all about skin in school, and she told elmo all about it.  michaelson asked our class what we could learn by looking at our skin.  so we started to investigate.  we could see that everybody's skin looked different.  there was dark skin, light skin, and all different shades in between.  my skin was dark, and cassie had light skin with rosy cheeks.  then we looked at our skin through a magnifying glass.  it makes things look bigger.  we could see all sorts of things we never noticed before.  there was hair growing out of our skin, and the fronts of our arms had more hair than the back of our arms, but the palms of our hands didn't have any hair at all, but they had lots of lines.  so did the tips of our fingers.  some parts of our skin were smooth like our cheeks.  some parts were real wrinkly like our knuckles and elbows.  then we ran some water on our arms to see what our skin looked like when it was wet.  the water didn't soak in.  it just rolled right off.  we could see how our skin protects our bodies.  so even though everybody's skin looked different up close, our skin wasn't really very different at all.  elaine learned a lot about skin, but elmo still wants to find out more, don't you.  how can we find out even more.  hmm.  ha ha ha.  elmo almost jumped out of his skin, tv.  oh. good idea.  we can watch the all about skin channel on tv.  now turn yourself on, tv.  thank you.  welcome to the all about skin channel.  when it comes to skin, we've got you covered, and now the story of the girl who loved her skin.  once a upon a time, there was a girl who loved her skin.  i love my skin.  she loved it so much that she took very good care of it.  when her skin got dirty, she washed it.  scrubadubdub.  when her skin was out in the sun, she put sunscreen on to protect it.  rubarubrub.  huh.  when her skin was cold, it got goose bumps, so she put on more clothes to warm her skin.  ahh.  and when her skin got hot, it sweated to help cool her off.  whew.  ahh.  when she went roller skating, she protected her skin with special padding, but one day, she fell down and hurt her skin anyway.  oh, no. i got a booboo on my skin.  the girl's mother loved her skin, too, and knew just what to do.  she washed the booboo, put ointment on it, and covered it up with a bandage to keep it clean.  thanks, mom. my skin feels better already.  and every day, the girl's skin felt better and better until one day the booboo was gone.  her skin had healed itself.  wow. now i really, really love my skin.  and from then on, the girl who loved her skinreally, really loved.  the girl who really, really loved her skin took really, really good care of it, especially when roller skating.  hey. you got to love the skin you're in.   i'm ok, and so is my skin.  the end.  coming up next on the all about skin channel, "that's skincredible" followed by
