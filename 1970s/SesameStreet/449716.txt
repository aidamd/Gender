your leg.  see. everybody can do that.  um, i don't know.  i mean, i don't think i could do that so well.  elmo thought he could do it, too, but maybe not.  maybe not yet, but you keep practicing, all right.  oh, yeah. elmo will keep practicing.  thank you, leela.  ok. ok.  step, clap, clap, leap, leap, lift yourliftliftlift.  elmo, ohh. i don't believe it.  why did i ever let you be part of this dance.  you are the worst.  aah. ohh.   ok. i'm calm.  let's try it again.  ok, elmo.  elmo.  elmo.  hmm. he's gone.  wow. that's funny.  where did he go.  elmo.  oh. elmo, what happened.  we have to finish practicing our dance.  elmo's not dancing with zoe anymore.  what. not dancing.  what are you talking about.  elmo's upset.  elmo doesn't want to be zoe's friend anymore.  what. bye.  butbutbut, elmo, wait a minute.  you can't just walk off on friendship day.  hey, zoe. what's going on.  elmo's upset with me, and i don't know why.  you don't know why he's upset.  well, i'm not sure.  i mean, we were dancing.  that doesn't seem so bad.  yeah, and then he just left.  i mean, that's all.  well, it must be something more than that.  well, maybe i can use magic to replay what happened.  oh. yeah, yeah.  just lean forward, and then i'm gonna touch your memory spot with my wand and do my special memory spell.  ooh. ok. ready.  here we go. yeah.  open your mindopen your heart, replay what happened right from the start.  oh. wow.  abby, how did you do that.  it's just my magic.  now watch.  step, clap, clap, leap, leap, lift yourliftliftlift. ohh.  elmo, ohh. i don't believe it.  why did i ever let you be part of this dance.  you are the worst.  aah. ohh.  oh. oh, gosh, zoe.  did you hear what you said to elmo.  what.  you said he was the worst.  no, no, no. i didn't say that.  did i. yes, you did.  look. i'll replay it again.  ohh. i don't believe it.  why did i ever let you be part of this dance.  you are the worst.  aah. ohh.  see. no wonder elmo was upset.  i think you must have hurt his feelings.  yeah, but i didn't mean that he was the worst.  i just got frustrated and said it.  it didn't mean anything.  well, maybe it meant something to elmo.  well, i'll just go tell elmo that it was only words.  i'm sure he'll be fine.  i don't know, zoe.  hey, chris. hey.  hey, leela. hi.  oh. hi, elmo.  what does zoe want.  why are you so upset, elmo.  zoe said elmo was the worst.  oh, i didn't really mean the worst.  i just said that.  it didn't mean anything.  it was just a word.  but it's a word that hurts elmo's feelings, zoe.  elmo didn't like it.  elmo's got to go, zoe.  ..  zoe, you have to remember that words are really important.  words can really hurt.  but they always say that sticks and stones can break my bones, but words can never hurt me.  no. that's not true, zoe.  in fact, if you say something mean to somebody, it can hurt.  it can hurt really bad.  and that hurt can last for a long, long time.   be careful with the words you use    be careful with the words you say    be careful with the words you choose    a word can hurt or make your day    saying something very mean    to someone who's your friend    can have a very sad result    and make that friendship end    be careful with the words you use    be careful with the words you say    be careful with the words you choose    a word can hurt or make your day    because once you say an unkind word    it doesn't go away    you can't just say it was a joke    the hurt will always stay    yes, sticks and stones can break your bones    but words can hurt you, too    so please think twice    say something nice    that's my advice to you   i guess i didn't think that just saying a little word like that could hurt so much.  i must have really hurt elmo's feelings.  i better go find him quick and apologize.  elmo.  elmo's not talking to you.  oh, elmo, please listen to me.  ii'm really sorry.  zoe said a mean thing.  i know, and i'm really sorry.  i just got frustrated and didn't think.  i would never want to lose you as a friend, elmo.  well, even if elmo can't do the friendship dance right.  sure. even if.  well, ok. ok.  elmo forgives zoe.  ahh.  yeah. elmo and zoe can still be friends.  oh, good.  oh. i'm so glad.  elmo, too.  ok. come on, friend.  let's show everybody our friendship day dance.  ok, friend. yeah. let's go.  all right.

really think so.  oh, yeah. of course.  you're my friend, and i believe in you.  ha ha ha. thanks, zoe.  now come on. let's try it again.  ok.  step, clap, clap,leap, lift your leg.  oh, elmo got

we'll be back with more on friends, but right now, check this out.  he observes.  he questions.  he investigates.  what does this button do.  aah.  super grover 2.0.  he shows up.  somewhere by a woodland stream, 1 little duckling is about to waddle into a big problem.  ha. yippee.  oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.  i can't wait to get to the party.  it's going to be so much fun.  ohh.  a stream.  and the party is onthe other side.  oh, no. howill i ever get across.  help, help.  aah.  ohh, ohh.  super grover 2.0.  you showed up.  unh. it is what i do.  so what seems to be theproblem, little one.  i'm trying to get to that party over there, but i don't know how to get across the stream.  first, i shall unleashthe power of observation.  mmm.  oh, i don't want tomiss the party.  i see with mysuper eyes that you walk like a duck.  quack.  and i hearwith my super ears that you quack like a duck.  quack.  my super powers ofobservation tell me you are a duck.  of course i'm a duck.  quack.  well, then do notbe daffy, duck.  you can swimacross the stream.  everyone knows thatducks can swim.  well, yes, but ifi swim across, i'll ruin my brandnew party shoes.  look.  stunning.  wait. ducks can alsofly, can they not.  if you fly to the other side,your shoes will not get wet.  well, yes, but i'm justa duckling, a baby duck.  i haven't learned to fly yet.  ahh. a toddlerwaddler, i see.  so the question is howcan a duckling cross this stream without gettingher new shoes wet.  that's the question.  well, fear not, myfashionforward friend.  i will now unleashthe power of investigation.   excuse me.  sure.  ahh. i see the streamis full of water.  no wonder it is so wet.  we must soak upall this water and dry out the stream.  how. have you gota plan up your sleeve.  no, but i havea towel down my sock.  ah ha ha.  this highly absorbentpaper towel should do the trick.  1 paper towel.  i don't think that's enoughto soak up all the water in the stream, super grover.  i beg toduffer, dickiediffer, duckie.  observe as i simply dipthis towel into the stream.  and would you look atall the water it absorbed.  yes. ha. there.  you can run alongto your party now.  the stream is all dried up.  no. no, it's not.  it's still full of water.  what.  if only there werea bridge here.  what's that now.  you know, something sturdyand dry that connects one side of a stream to the other side.  oh, you mea crossy over thing.  what good would that do.  well, i could walk across itwithout my shoes getting wet.  well, then stand back,for i super grover 0 will now unleash the power ofengineering and design you a crossy over thing.  you mean a bridge.  yeah. whatever.  ahh.   design, design, design   and tada.  a bridge made of broccoli.  yes. it isthe latest in green design.  what do you think.  well, i don't think thatbroccoli is the right thing to ..  of course it is.  ver.  now let me check my utilitysock for some broccoli.  ahh, ahh.  there we are.  and now i will justfollow my design and place this broccoliacross the stream.  the broccoli's notlong enough to reach the other sideof the stream.  now i'll never getto the party.   i'm gonna cry.  waah waah waah.  it is your party,and you can cry if you want to, but i know what i must do.  what.  find a longerpiece of broccoli.  there must be onehere somewhere.   what is this woodenroundy thingy doing in my sock.  hey. maybe wecould use that.  do not be silly.  this is not broccoli.  it's a log,super grover, and it looks like itmight be long engh to stretchacross the stream.  not now, little waddler.  ..  i must find thatpesky vegetable.  then it's time for meto unleash the power of engineering.  super grover, look.  i designed my own bridge.  that's not broccoli. agh.  i guess i'll justbuild the bridge myself then.  i can just push thislog over to the stream.  thbroccoli.  ahh. super grover, i did it.  i engineereda bridge with the log.  it was long enough.  ok. let's see if this works.  ahh.  i'll start on this sideand waddle, waddle, waddle, waddle, waddle, waddle,waddle to the other side without getting myshoes wet.  ha.  it worked.  now i can go to the party.  thanks
