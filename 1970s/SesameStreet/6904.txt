it's a school, it can fly    let's all hurry to the flying fairy school    grab your wands   yeeha.   bring your wings  yeah.   we will learn magic things    let's all hurry to the flying fairy school    how to make us grow    and how to make us shrink   whoa.   how to solve a problem with a simple twinkle think    the school is really magic    and magic's really cool    let's go in, let's begin    it's flying fairy school   ha ha ha.  ha ha.  oh. hmm. hmm. ohh.  mm.  welcome to the flying fairy school puppet theater.  it's puppet time, so grab a puppet and make it move.  ok, puppet, let's see your moves.  excuse me, puppet. aah. oh, no.   i can't feel a pulse.  go on, breathe, darn you. breathe.  blogg, you do know that puppet's not alive, don't you.  not on my watch.  it worked.  it's a miracle.  hey, what are you doing with those strings.  puppets can't move on their own.  you got to pull their strings to make them move, like this.  i can do that.  well, actually, i think it's more like this.  i don't need help.  well, maybe if youahahah.  i can do it myself.  ooh, this puppet stuff has too many strings attached.  i'll just get him to move another way.  i'm gonna turn this puppet into a real boy.  oh, that doesn't sound like a good idea.  i'll just use the blue fairy special, and i think it goes like this.  go to a luau, eat some poi, and turn this puppet into a real boy.  come on, real boy who was once a puppet.  let's boogie down.  why can't i boogie down.  you're a puppet.  nonsense. puppets are made of wood.   aah. i'm a puppet.  looks like someone tried to turn a puppet into a real boy.  don't worryi can just turn myself back.   i'm afraid that's impossible even if you could move your arms.  you see, the only way to turn a puppet into a real boy is to go through the pinocchio process.  what's the pinocchio process.  the pinocchio process is a series of steps that goes like this.  hop with a cricket, do the donkey dance of joy, swim with a whale, and you'll become a real boy.  looks like we have to find some animals.  yeah. first up, a cricket.  i can do that. no problem.   um, maybe i'd better poof us there.  but where do you find a cricket.  well, a cricket's an insect, and i always see insects out in the grass.  then let's get up and get out of class and look for a cricket in the grass.  all right, class, let's find a cricket.  they look like this.   ah, something moved.  oh, is it a cricket.  hey, can't a ladybug get some privacy.  a ladybug. ha. we better keep looking.   maybe it's a cricket.  yikes. what kind of bug is that.  time for a termite snack.   a termite. they eat wood, you know.  .   this wood tastes like feet. blergh.  ha. what's that sound.   it's a cricket.  go, boy. time to hop.  you want us to help pull your strings.  nah. i can do it myself.   well, you can help if you want, but i definitely do not need it.   hop, hop, hop. hop, hop, hop.  my legs. they're back to normal.  yay.  darn you.  why is the rest of blogg's body still puppet.  because blogg has to go through the next step of the pinocchio processthe donkey dance of joy.  then let us go find a donkey.  we don't need a giraffe or a monkey.  what we need is a donkey.  come on, donkey.  let us do the donkey dance of joy.   donkey tells me he does not want to do the donkey dance of joy.  probably because he's a very angry donkey.  aah. what are we gonna do.  maybe we need something to make that donkey happy.  but what makes donkeys happy.  i don't know. let's ask spot.  spot. oh, spot.   oh, hi, spot.  how do you make a donkey happy.  fetch, spot, fetch.   hay. hay. hay.   go and tell your whole class    that it comes from the dry grass    you find it in a haystack    some animals have it for a snack   ..hay.    what did that song have to do with donkeys.  let's twinkle think.   twinkle think, twinkle think   i know. yow.  i think the donkey is a punk rocker.  i think the answer probably has something to do with hay.   oh. oh.  no, that can't be it.  sure it can, gonnigan.  the song said animals have hay for a snack.  maybe the donkey's hungry, hungry for hay.  ok, then, listen to what i say.  give us a big plate of hay.     and the donkey's happy.  and he's doing the donkey dance of joy.  i got to dance with him.  i don't need help.  if you insist.     heehaw. heehaw.  heehaw.  wow. it worked.  blogg's arms and wings are back now.  but i still have a puppet head.  that's because you haven't done the last step of the pinocchio process.  you have to swim with a whale.  and whales live in the ocean, so, let's get our wheels in motion.  poof on down to the ocean.  well, here we are, and there's the whale.  aah. i didn't expect it to be so huge.  now's your chance, blogg. swim with a whale.  ok. here i go.   what's wrong.  i can't do it.  your arms and legs and wings are all back to normal.  but i don't know how you swim.  oh, no.  maybe you can ask for something to get you to swim.  ah. how about rocket fins.  .. ok. i admit it.  i can't do this on my own. i need help.  you heard him, gonnigan.  ok. i can help. i think.  let's swim.  and reach and pull and akick, kick, kick and areach and apull and a kickkickkick.  i'm doing it. i'm swimming with a whale.  and i'm back to normal.  yay.  thanks, whale, and thank you all.  i couldn't have done it without you.  you're welcome.  swimming with whales was really cool, but now let's all go back to school.  i know a different way to get them to move.  no.   dadumdadado, dadumdado   great work, blogg.   dadumdadado, dadumdado    i love puppets.  me,

great to be here in east africa, but what are we looking for again.  a big gathering of elephants, ernie.  it's called a herd.  well, so far, we haven't seen a single elephant.  the guidebook says they should be somewhere around here.  hmm.  i think i see something, something really big, and it's getting closer.  uh, bert.  we don't want to scare away the elephants, ernie.  well, the only thing you might scare away, bert, is that butterfly on your binoculars.  heh heh heh.  huh. hey, you. shoo. whoa.  steady there, bert.  i have an idea.  maybe if i make elephant sounds, that will make them come.  quack quack. ernie, that's a duck.  just kidding, bert. heh heh heh.  ..   now you sounded more like a very sad elephant.  but i didn't make any sound, bert.  then who did.    it's a baby elephant.  gee. this is great, bert.   maybe not so great, ernie.  what do you mean.  he's too little to be all alone.  mama.  aw. you're right, bert.  i think he misses his mama, and she must be so worried wondering where here baby is.  don't cry, little elephant.  we'll help you find your mama.  mama.  but how.  those are his baby elephant tracks.  maybe if we follow them back the way he came, they'll lead us to the herd.  great idea, buddy bert.  let's follow them.  come on, baby elephant.   here, boy.  maybe he needs a little push.  ok.   .  maybe he's not moving because he's used to following other elephants.  let's pretend we have elephant trunks.  rrrooo.  ernie. ha ha ha.  it works, and there's no time to lose, so swing your elephant trunk, and let's go.  ehhh.   looks like he's hungry.  says here that's a marula tree and that elephants love to eat its fruit.  well, then, guess you'll have to climb up and get him some, bert.   ha ha ha.  maybe i can reach the fruit.  give me a boost.  aah.  ha ha ha.  now why didn't he do that in the first place.  come on. it's getting late.  we still have to find your mama.  mama.  rrrooo.  look. more footprints.  baby elephant came by here, too.  oh, no. now cut that out.  there's no time for water games.  aw, bert. he'shaving so much fun.  besides, it's good forhim to have a bath.  mamas love to see their babies clean, right, baby.  aah. heh heh heh.  and i like to see you clean, too, bert.  err. ernie.  if that elephant herd goes away, we may never find his mama.  gee, bert. we can't let that happen.  come on, baby elephant.  we've got to hurry.  rrrooo.  ernie, no more footprints.  i don't know where to go now.  do you think the elephant herd could be gone.  aw. don't worry, baby elephant.  you can always come

the south pole for the famous moment when once a year the penguins fly back to capistrano.  we'd like to help you, pal, but we can't fly there.  why not.  because penguins don't fly.  .  you do not fly.  how can that be.  you are birds.  you have wingy things.  they're flippers.  for swimming.  we swim.  we don't fly.  well, of course you do not fly.  you're flapping all wrong.  you have to flap up and down like this like the birdies you are.  come on. come on. flap with me now.  up and down.  ok.  think capistrano.  capistrano.  capistrano, capistrano, capistrano, capistrano, capistrano, capicapistrani will settle for cucamonga.  cucamonga, cucamonga.  i'm flapping to cucamonga.  what.  no liftoff.  that's what we told you, pal.  penguins don't fly.  so, elmo, correction.  today, the penguins will not fly back to capistrano.  hey, hey. we could swim to capistrano.  ooh. we could. yeah, yeah, yeah.  whoa.  they will swim back to capistrano.  so long, elmo.  any swallows around here.  thanks, computer.  elmo's friend john just loves penguins, so his dad took him to the zoo to see real live ones, and he told elmo all about it.  my dad works at atlantis marine world aquarium.  he takes care of the penguins there, and sometimes, i go along to help.  they live in a special place.  they have a big pool to swim in, and there are cubby holes to nest in.  penguins are birds, and they lay eggs like other birds.  they have a beach area to walk around in, and there's a neat tunnel that goes under the beach area and comes up under a glass dome so people can go in and watch the penguins right up close.  penguins walk standing up like people.  they take short steps.  it's call waddling.  they even sleep standing up.  they clean themselves with their beaks.  it's called preening.  we wash down the beach area to keep it clean, and we feed them fish.  they really come quickly when they know it's lunchtime.  they love fish.  they can swallow a whole fish.  awesome.  but you have to be careful because they have sharp beaks, and after lunch, they like to go swimming, and can they swim.  they like to do things together.  they are outstanding.  yeah. elmo likes penguins, too.  elmo wants to know even more about them, don't you.  how can we find out even more.  hmm.  ooh. oh, it's tv.  look. we can watch the penguin channel.  turn yourself on, tv. thank you.  it's the penguin channel, all penguins all the time.  that was "flipper on ice" and waddle be next.

it's a school, it can fly    let's all hurry to the flying fairy school    grab your wands   yeeha.   bring your wings  yeah.   we will learn magic things    let's all hurry to the flying fairy school    how to make us grow    and how to make us shrink   whoa.   how to solve a problem with a simple twinkle think    the school is really magic    and magic's really cool    let's go in, let's begin    it's flying fairy school   ha ha ha.  ha ha.  oh. hmm. hmm. ohh.  mm.  welcome to the flying fairy school puppet theater.  it's puppet time, so grab a puppet and make it move.  ok, puppet, let's see your moves.  excuse me, puppet. aah. oh, no.   i can't feel a pulse.  go on, breathe, darn you. breathe.  blogg, you do know that puppet's not alive, don't you.  not on my watch.  it worked.  it's a miracle.  hey, what are you doing with those strings.  puppets can't move on their own.  you got to pull their strings to make them move, like this.  i can do that.  well, actually, i think it's more like this.  i don't need help.  well, maybe if youahahah.  i can do it myself.  ooh, this puppet stuff has too many strings attached.  i'll just get him to move another way.  i'm gonna turn this puppet into a real boy.  oh, that doesn't sound like a good idea.  i'll just use the blue fairy special, and i think it goes like this.  go to a luau, eat some poi, and turn this puppet into a real boy.  come on, real boy who was once a puppet.  let's boogie down.  why can't i boogie down.  you're a puppet.  nonsense. puppets are made of wood.   aah. i'm a puppet.  looks like someone tried to turn a puppet into a real boy.  don't worryi can just turn myself back.   i'm afraid that's impossible even if you could move your arms.  you see, the only way to turn a puppet into a real boy is to go through the pinocchio process.  what's the pinocchio process.  the pinocchio process is a series of steps that goes like this.  hop with a cricket, do the donkey dance of joy, swim with a whale, and you'll become a real boy.  looks like we have to find some animals.  yeah. first up, a cricket.  i can do that. no problem.   um, maybe i'd better poof us there.  but where do you find a cricket.  well, a cricket's an insect, and i always see insects out in the grass.  then let's get up and get out of class and look for a cricket in the grass.  all right, class, let's find a cricket.  they look like this.   ah, something moved.  oh, is it a cricket.  hey, can't a ladybug get some privacy.  a ladybug. ha. we better keep looking.   maybe it's a cricket.  yikes. what kind of bug is that.  time for a termite snack.   a termite. they eat wood, you know.  .   this wood tastes like feet. blergh.  ha. what's that sound.   it's a cricket.  go, boy. time to hop.  you want us to help pull your strings.  nah. i can do it myself.   well, you can help if you want, but i definitely do not need it.   hop, hop, hop. hop, hop, hop.  my legs. they're back to normal.  yay.  darn you.  why is the rest of blogg's body still puppet.  because blogg has to go through the next step of the pinocchio processthe donkey dance of joy.  then let us go find a donkey.  we don't need a giraffe or a monkey.  what we need is a donkey.  come on, donkey.  let us do the donkey dance of joy.   donkey tells me he does not want to do the donkey dance of joy.  probably because he's a very angry donkey.  aah. what are we gonna do.  maybe we need something to make that donkey happy.  but what makes donkeys happy.  i don't know. let's ask spot.  spot. oh, spot.   oh, hi, spot.  how do you make a donkey happy.  fetch, spot, fetch.   hay. hay. hay.   go and tell your whole class    that it comes from the dry grass    you find it in a haystack    some animals have it for a snack   ..hay.    what did that song have to do with donkeys.  let's twinkle think.   twinkle think, twinkle think   i know. yow.  i think the donkey is a punk rocker.  i think the answer probably has something to do with hay.   oh. oh.  no, that can't be it.  sure it can, gonnigan.  the song said animals have hay for a snack.  maybe the donkey's hungry, hungry for hay.  ok, then, listen to what i say.  give us a big plate of hay.     and the donkey's happy.  and he's doing the donkey dance of joy.  i got to dance with him.  i don't need help.  if you insist.     heehaw. heehaw.  heehaw.  wow. it worked.  blogg's arms and wings are back now.  but i still have a puppet head.  that's because you haven't done the last step of the pinocchio process.  you have to swim with a whale.  and whales live in the ocean, so, let's get our wheels in motion.  poof on down to the ocean.  well, here we are, and there's the whale.  aah. i didn't expect it to be so huge.  now's your chance, blogg. swim with a whale.  ok. here i go.   what's wrong.  i can't do it.  your arms and legs and wings are all back to normal.  but i don't know how you swim.  oh, no.  maybe you can ask for something to get you to swim.  ah. how about rocket fins.  .. ok. i admit it.  i can't do this on my own. i need help.  you heard him, gonnigan.  ok. i can help. i think.  let's swim.  and reach and pull and akick, kick, kick and areach and apull and a kickkickkick.  i'm doing it. i'm swimming with a whale.  and i'm back to normal.  yay.  thanks, whale, and thank you all.  i couldn't have done it without you.  you're welcome.  swimming with whales was really cool, but now let's all go back to school.  i know a different way to get them to move.  no.   dadumdadado, dadumdado   great work, blogg.   dadumdadado, dadumdado    i love puppets.  me,

dancing in my head   picture sleep.   buddy bert  what.   buckle up, and we'll fly away   whoa. yeah.   we're adventuring    every time the bed starts tapping    something special's gonna happen   this is kind of catchy.   my favorite kind of traveling   hyah.   we're adventuring    come along with bert and ernie    we're gonna take a little journey    bert and ernie's great adventures   it's great to be here in east africa, but what are we looking for again.  a big gathering of elephants, ernie.  it's called a herd.  well, so far, we haven't seen a single elephant.  the guidebook says they should be somewhere around here.  hmm.  i think i see something, something really big, and it's getting closer.  uh, bert.  we don't want to scare away the elephants, ernie.  well, the only thing you might scare away, bert, is that butterfly on your binoculars.  heh heh heh.  huh. hey, you. shoo. whoa.  steady there, bert.  i have an idea.  maybe if i make elephant sounds, that will make them come.  quack quack. ernie, that's a duck.  just kidding, bert. heh heh heh.  ..   now you sounded more like a very sad elephant.  but i didn't make any sound, bert.  then who did.    it's a baby elephant.  gee. this is great, bert.   maybe not so great, ernie.  what do you mean.  he's too little to be all alone.  mama.  aw. you're right, bert.  i think he misses his mama, and she must be so worried wondering where here baby is.  don't cry, little elephant.  we'll help you find your mama.  mama.  but how.  those are his baby elephant tracks.  maybe if we follow them back the way he came, they'll lead us to the herd.  great idea, buddy bert.  let's follow them.  come on, baby elephant.   here, boy.  maybe he needs a little push.  ok.   whoa. you know, bert.  maybe he's not moving because he's used to following other elephants.  let's pretend we have elephant trunks.  rrrooo.  ernie. ha ha ha.  it works, and there's no time to lose, so swing your elephant trunk, and let's go.  ehhh.   looks like he's hungry.  says here that's a marula tree and that elephants love to eat its fruit.  well, then, guess you'll have to climb up and get him some, bert.   ha ha ha.  maybe i can reach the fruit.  give me a boost.  aah.  ha ha ha.  now why didn't he do that in the first place.  come on. it's getting late.  we still have to find your mama.  mama.  rrrooo.  look. more footprints.  baby elephant came by here, too.  oh, no. now cut that out.  there's no time for water games.  aw, bert. he'shaving so much fun.  besides, it's good forhim to have a bath.  mamas love to see their babies clean, right, baby.  aah. heh heh heh.  and i like to see you clean, too, bert.  err. ernie.  if that elephant herd goes away, we may never find his mama.  gee, bert. we can't let that happen.  come on, baby elephant.  we've got to hurry.  rrrooo.  ernie, no more footprints.  i don't know where to go now.  do you think the elephant herd could be gone.  aw. don't worry, baby elephant.  you can always come live with us.  i think you might fit in ourahchoobathtub.  ahchoo.    you made an elephant sound.  do it again.    it's the elephants.  they heard you.   mama.  mama.  ernie, look.  we did it, bert.  we got the baby back to his mama.  don't you just love happy endings.  ah ah ah. heh heh heh.   good night, bert.  good night, ernie.  uhoh.   are you ready to take a

don't fly.  .  you do not fly.  how can that be.  you are birds.  you have wingy things.  they're flippers.  for swimming.  we swim.  we don't fly.  well, of course you do not fly.  you're flapping

 so, elmo, correction.  today, the penguins will not fly back to capistrano.  hey, hey. we could swim to capistrano.  ooh. we could. yeah, yeah, yeah.  whoa.  they will swim back to capistrano.  so long, elmo.  any swallows around here.  thanks, computer.  elmo's friend john just loves penguins, so his dad took him to the zoo to see real live ones, and he told elmo all about it.  my dad works at atlantis marine world aquarium.  he takes care of the penguins there, and sometimes, i go along to help.  they live in a special place.  they have a big pool to swim in, and there are cubby holes to nest in.  penguins are birds, and they lay eggs like other birds.  they have a beach area to walk around in, and there's a neat tunnel that goes under the beach area and comes up under a glass dome so people can go in and watch the penguins right up close.  penguins walk standing up like people.  they take short steps.  it's call waddling.  they even sleep standing up.  they clean themselves with their beaks.  it's called preening.  we wash down the beach area to keep it clean, and we feed them fish.  they really come quickly when they know it's lunchtime.  they love fish.  they can swallow a whole fish.  awesome.  but you have to be careful because they have sharp beaks, and after lunch, they like to go swimming, and can they swim.  they like to do things together.  they are outstanding.  yeah. elmo likes penguins, too.  elmo wants to know even more about them, don't you.  how can we find out even more.  hmm.  ooh. oh, it's tv.  look. we can watch the penguin channel.  turn yourself on, tv. thank you.  it's the penguin channel, all penguins all the time.  that was "flipper on ice" and waddle be next.
