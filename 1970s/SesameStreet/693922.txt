with a simple twinkle think    the school is really magic    and magic's really cool    let's go in, let's begin    it's flying fairy school   ha ha ha.  ha ha.  hello. i'm mrs. sparklenose.  welcome to flying fairy school.  today, we're in the art center.  whoa.  be with you in a minute.  i'm glad you're here.  today at flying fairy school, everyone is making mystical, magical macaroni art, so come on.  raise your wand or your finger, and let's get to it.  what kind of mystical, magical macaroni art can i make.  ooh. i know.  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 sides.  oh. it's a macaroni hexagon.  wait. i changed my mind.  oh. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 sides.  it's now a macaroni octagon.  wait. i changed my mind again.  is she gonna make a macaroni pentagon, a macaroni heptagon, a macaroni tetradecagon.  actually, it's a macaroni horsey. ha ha.  what mystical, magical macaroni art are you going to make, gonnigan.  oh. i already made mine.  it's a bowl of macaroni made completely of macaroni.  eep. eep eep. eep.   eep.  hey. don't eat my art.  it brings down the value.  if you want to see some great mystical, magical macaroni art, then check this out.  it's gonna be big.  it's gonna be huge.  it's gonna be humongous.  whoa.  that is humongous.  what is it.  it's a dinosaur made completely of macaroni.  i call it macaronisaurus.  that is totally cool, blogg.  thank you, but it's not done yet.  i need something to bring it to life.  try glitter glue.  if you ask me, a little glitter glue always adds just the right amount of sparkle.  i was thinking of something a little more spicy.  what. like paprika.  no. this.  ooh.  the spice of life.  but if you put the spice of life on the humongous macaronisaurus, it will come alive.  well, what good is a macaronisaurus if you can't play with it.  if you make a macaronisaurus move from bottom to top, you'd better know how to make the macaronisaurus stop.  don't worry. i got it all under control.  now it's time to spice things up.  oh. i can't watch.  aw. it didn't work.  maybe the spice of life has passed its expiration date.   or maybe not. aah.  come on, macaronisaurus.  let's play some checkers.   maybe he's more of a chess person.  looks like he wants to play dressup.  ok by me.  we'll put on some tutus.   oh, what are we gonna do.  aah. ohh.  don't worry. i'll handle this.   come here, macaronisaurus.  that did not go as well as i hoped.  oh, no. we got to make it stop.  you have to use your noodles to figure this out.  using noodles is what got us into this mess in the first place.  not macaroni noodles, these kinds of noodles.  oh. right.  let's twinkle think.  what makes things stop.  twinkle think, twinkle think, twinkle think.  i know.  dead batteries.  bicycle brakes.  a dancing kumquat wearing a polkadotted mumu.  huh.  that would make me stop.  how about a stop sign.  yeah. stop signs make people stop.  let's try a stop sign.  i'll head down to the department of transportation and see if they have any extras lying around.  wait, gonnigan.  we can just make a stop sign.  we need 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 pieces of ..  but that's just an octagon, not a stop sign.  it's the right shape, but there's something missing.  what is it.  this is never going to work.  we might as well just stop.  that's it. we need the word stop.  stop. stop.  stop.   it didn't work.  the macaronisaurus went right through the stop sign.  that's against the law.  eep eep.   eeeeep.  looks like niblet's gonna give him a ticket.  whatever he's doing, it's working.  that little gerbilcorn is stopping that humongous macaronisaurus.  eep eep eep.  hmm.   oh, no. it didn't work.  the flying fairy school is doomed.  take it easy, gonnigan.  keep thinking.  you just need to spot the solution.  that's it. spot.  we need spot's help.  here spot, here, boy.   now we need to find a way to solve the problem and stop a humongous macaroni dinosaur.  fetch, spot, fetch.   ha ha ha.  humongous.  humongous.  humongous.  humongous.  humongous.  we already know the macaronisaurus is humongous.  tell us something we don't know.  wait a minute.  maybe what spot is saying is that we need something humongous to stop something humongous.  now that's a humongous idea.  but what humongous thing do we need.  how about a humongous fence.   ha ha ha.  no, no. a humongous brick wall.   uh, uh, uh, a humongous meatball.  .  mama mia.  that's a humongousa meatball.  let's give it a try.  come on, guys. let's push that meatball.   it's not moving.  we need help.  eee eee eep.  wow.  what's gonna happen.  ha ha ha. ha ha ha.  ohh.  oh, no. it didn't work.  huh.  wait. look. he's stopping.  i can't believe it.  it worked.  we solved the problem. ha ha.  how'd you come up with a humongous meatball.  what goes better with macaroni than meatballs.  ha ha ha.  and it looks like he found something he likes to play with.  great. come on, macaronisaurus.  i'm open.  huh.  unh.  good job, fairies.  ha ha ha.  ha ha ha.  ha ha ha.  a little help.  it's almost time for super grover, but first we're gonna ..  how many is 13.  ..  7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.  let's count pogo stick jumps.  ..  7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.  13

observation.  mmhmm. mmhmm.  my supereyes see that thatball is shrinking, and wait.  what is that.  my superears hear something.  i hear it, too.it's a sss sound.  i think it's comingfrom the ball.  that can onlymean one thing.  there is a snake in that ball.  come on out of there, snake.  come on. we can hear you.  i feel something.  i think the snakejust blew into my ear.  super grover, there'sa hole in the ball.  i think the airis leaking out.  oh. i'll never get toplay with the ball now.  aw. there, thereow.  wow.  i am now observing that youare covered in sharp, little, prickly pointies.  aah. aah. unh.  yeah. i am a cactus.  ah. right.  wait a minute.  maybe i'm the reason theball has a hole in it.  maybe it's because of me.  aw. do not blameyourseaah. yow.  that hurts just asmuch the second time.  oh, oh.  don't you see.  i think i'm making the holesin the ball with my prickly parts, my spines.  oh. i'll never be ableto play ball.  of course you will.  we just have to answer thequestion what kind of ball can a cactus play with.  it is time to unleash thepower of investigation.  be right back.  ohh. that was fast.  here is theperfect ball for you.  a bowling ball.  it alreadyhas holes, but no air is leaking out.  here. try it.  unh.  whoa. sure is heavy.  but it is not leaking air.  come on. throw it to me.  i am wide open.  all right.  aah.  super grover 2.0,are you ok.  yes. just feelinga little bowled over.  i think i needa lighter ball.  then i shallinvestigate further for you.  be right back.  aah.sorry i took so long.  i took a wrongturn in antarctica.  you went to the south pole.  yes. to get you this ball.  a snowball.  it is lighter thana bowling ball.  but we're in a desert,where it's really hot.  so.  so the snowballis starting to melt.  so.  then we must play withit quickly before it melts.  here. throw it to me fast.  ok.  where did the ball go.  it just broke apart.  maybe there just isn'ta ball that a cactus can play with.  aw. there, thereow.  i have got to stop doing that.  i don't suppose you've gotanything in that utility sock of yours, do you.  good idea. i will check.  no, no.  just my lunch.   dee dee dee   a meatball hero sandwich.  mmm, mmm, mmm.  this superhero needs to takea lunch break and eat this super hero.  wait.  what is that.  this. this is merelythe foil from my sandwich.  it is nothing.  but it looks like youcould make it into any shape you want.  i wonder if you canshape it into a ball.  let me investigate this.  little pattypat here anda pattypat there andah ha ha ha.  why, yes, i can.  check it out.  it's not filled with air,and it's not too heavy, and it's not melting.  it's the perfect ball for me.  headsup.  and so thanks to hispowers of observation and investigation, our herofound that a foil ball was the perfect ball for acactus to play with.  ha ha ha.  give me a hug.  come here, you.  aah.  i think i'm leaking air.  elmo's world is almost here, but first, i want to

alex can't.  emily told elmo all about it.  yesterday i went over to my friend alex's house to play.  we played our favorite card game go fish.  alex is deaf, so his ears can't hear.  he looks at my lips to see what i'm saying.  go fish.  we played a few games, and then we got hungry.  alex's mom asked us what we wanted to eat.  she uses sign language to talk to alex.  that's another way he finds out what someone is saying.  we had bananas and milk.  ..  and milk.  and then we felt like dancing.  when we dance, i listen to the music with my ears, and alex feels the beat with his hands and feet.  i bet the fish in the aquarium felt the beat, too.  i love playing with my friend alex.  emily and alex are very good friends, but now elmo wants to learn more about ears.  how can we find out
