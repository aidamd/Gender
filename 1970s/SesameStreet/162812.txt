tasting with your tongue.  you mean, this.  ahh.  exactly, exactly.  now you can just taste the porridge and tell whether it's salty or sweet.  oh, cool.  oh, oh. elmo will do it.  yeah. elmo likes the taste of salt.  great.  ok.  it doesn't taste salty, just a little bit sweet.  so the white dots are not salt.  they're sugar.  oh, yes. well, thank you, everybody.  ha ha.  that was some excellent tasting, elmo.  thanks, alan.  you're welcome.  we're not just the excellent eyes and nose club anymore.  we are the excellent eyes, nose, and tongue club.  yes.   we have 2 eyes    we have

pleasant.  if you smell them, you'd know it.  it's ok, clubbers.  how about using our tongues.  telly, telly, telly.  elmo doesn't think our tongues will help us find sheep.  you don't want to taste them anyway.  wool is pretty fuzzy.  wait. what about your fingers.  hey. yeah, yeah, yeah.  let's feel around for the sheep.  maybe they're behind somewhere.  sheepy, sheepy.  where are you.   ..um,

hearing.  eh, how does this sound.  .  it sounds just like my kitty cat sounds when she wants me to pet her tummy.  i love my kitty.  ok. forget hearing.  use your senses and smell this.   mmm. mmm.  what do you mean, "mmm".  these are rotten eggs.  eww. these smell terrible.  you see, i always put rotten eggs in the soil when i'm gardening, and they always help me to grow beautiful flowers, so i love the smell of rotten eggs.  fine. forget the eggs.  use your senses and feel this.  hmm. soothing.  soothing. but this is yucky, muddy muck.  and it feels great.  it reminds me of that stuff they

burpy sounds like this.   perhaps not, blogg, but you can see the whole ocean in the flying fairy school water table.  all right, all right.  i'll take one peek.  come on, sludge balls.  let's have a look.  oh, dear.  i don't know what you're talking about.  i can't see a thing.  that's because your sludge balls fell in the water and now it's all yucky.  aah.  oh. the poor fishies.  we have to get

wish, i wish for fish.  whee hee.  yippeeeee.  aah.  good luck, my little school of fish.  i'd like to find those sludge balls, but i can't see a thing.  maybe we have to use our other senses.  what other senses.  i'm totally senseless.  the 5 senses, bloggsight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste.  i have those, but which sense do i use to find sludge balls.  let's twinkle think.  twinkle think,twinkle think.  well, your sludge ballsmake sounds, don't they.  yeah, like this. errp.  if the sludge balls makeburpy sounds, what sense can we use to find them.  hearing.  let's use our years and listen for the sludge balls' burpy sounds.   do you hear that.  that was a chomping sound and a burpy sound.  is it the sludge balls.   nope. that's just a fish with indigestion.   it sounds like the beautiful burps of my sludge balls.  come on.   oh. that octopus is juggling 3 sludge balls.  we need your help.  point your wand or your finger and say, "sludge " sludge balls away.  ..  ..  yikes3.  you found 3 sludge balls.   come on. we have to find 3 more.  whoa.  aah.  whoa. now we're being juggled by an octopus.  wow. never mind that.  just listen for those burpy sludge balls.  i can't hear a thing over this octopus' crazy circus music.  well, maybe we need to use one of our other senses.  well, those sludge balls did stink pretty badly.  let's twinkle think.  if something stinks, what sense should we use.  twinkle think, twinkle think.  smell.  let's use our noses and try to smell those sludge balls.   i smell something, but it's not a stinky smell.  it's a sweet smell.  ooh. those are water lilies.  we better keep smelling.  oh, oh, oh, oh.  pew.   my nose would know that stink anywhere.  ..sludge balls.  whoohoo.  " sludge balls away.  ..  waah5, 5 altogether.  that means there's 1 sludge ball left.   i can see clearly now the sludge is gone   not completely gone, but at least we can use our eyes to see the last sludge ball.  we can just look for the sludge ball's strange glow.  ooh. check it out.  come back here, sludge ball.  aah. that's no sludge ball.  that's an electric eel.  yaah.  it's gonna give us a shock.  swim away, swim away.  oh, no.  we got to help gonnigan and distract that eel.  come on, blogg.  here, eely, eely, eely.  over here.     huh.  the eel's glow goes on and off every time we

ball.  how do you think it's gonna bounce.  not so high.  why do you think it's gonna bounce not so high.  because it's hard and it's small.  ok. it's hard, and it's small.  ok, sofia. let's give it a bounce.  the pingpong ball went between the blue and the purple.  bring out the next ball.  daniela, what kind of ball do you have.  i have a baseball.  how high do you think that baseball will

skin in school, and she told elmo all about it.  michaelson asked our class what we could learn by looking at our skin.  so we started to investigate.  we could see that everybody's skin looked different.  there was dark skin, light skin, and all different shades in between.  my skin was dark, and cassie had light skin with rosy cheeks.  then we looked at our skin through a magnifying glass.  it makes things look bigger.  we could see all sorts of things we never noticed before.  there was hair growing out of our skin, and the fronts of our arms had more hair than the back of our arms, but the palms of our hands didn't have any hair at all, but they had lots of lines.  so did the tips of our fingers.  some parts of our skin were smooth like our cheeks.  some parts were real wrinkly like our knuckles and elbows.  then we ran some water on our arms to see what our skin looked like when it was wet.  the water didn't soak in.  it just rolled right off.  we could see how our skin protects our bodies.  so even though everybody's skin looked different up close, our skin wasn't really very different at all.  elaine learned a lot about skin, but elmo still wants to find out more, don't you.  how can we find out even more.  hmm.  ha ha ha.  elmo almost jumped out of his skin, tv.  oh. good idea.  we can watch the all about skin channel on tv.  now turn yourself on, tv.  thank you.  welcome to the all about skin channel.  when it comes to skin, we've got you covered, and now the story of the girl who loved her skin.  once a upon a time, there was a girl who loved her skin.  i love my skin.  she loved it so much that she took very good care of it.  when her skin got dirty, she washed it.  scrubadubdub.  when her skin was out in the sun, she put sunscreen on to protect it.  rubarubrub.  huh.  when her skin was cold, it got goose bumps, so she put on more clothes to warm her skin.  ahh.  and when her skin got hot, it sweated to help cool her off.  whew.  ahh.  when she went roller skating, she protected her skin with special padding, but one day, she fell down and hurt her skin anyway.  oh, no. i got a booboo on my skin.  the girl's mother loved her skin, too, and knew just what to do.  she washed the booboo, put ointment on it, and covered it up with a bandage to keep it clean.  thanks, mom. my skin feels better already.  and every day, the girl's skin felt better and better until one day the booboo was gone.  her skin had healed itself.  wow. now i really, really love my skin.  and from then on, the girl who loved her skinreally, really loved.  the girl who really, really loved her skin took really, really good care of it, especially when roller skating.  hey. you got to love the skin you're in.   i'm ok, and so is my skin.  the end.  coming up next
