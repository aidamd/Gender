oh. that's that, dorothy.  hmm.  ok. ok.  dorothy says that trees don't usually show up like that out of nowhere.  what.  huh. oh. ok.  dorothy says trees usually grow out of the ground. yeah.  dorothy, you're so smart.  hmm.  oh. you're welcome. ha ha ha.  elmo wants to know what else grows out of the ground and what doesn't.  don't you. let's find out.  oh. oh, not again, drawer.  whoooah.  do carrots grow out of the ground.  yes.  do oranges grow out of the ground.  no.  but they grow on a tree that does.  ha ha ha.  do worms grow out of the ground.  no.  but they live in the ground.  ooh. ha ha.  except for slimey.  he lives in a trashcan.  ha ha ha. silly drawer.  elmo loves slimey.  slimey's elmo's friend.  elmo has another friend cody, who grew his own plant.  cool, huh.  cody told elmo all about it.  first, cody took some paper towels, crumpled them up nice and tight, and stuffed them in a glass.  then he took some beans and dropped them on top of the paper towels.  see the beans. ha ha.  now cody knows that plants need water to grow, so he poured some water on top of the beans.  then he waited, and he watered, and he waited.  ha ha ha.  and he watered and waited and watered.  ha ha ha.  and waited until finally after lots of days the beans began to grow.  wow. ha ha ha.  cody put some dirt in a pot, and then they put the bean plant in the pot.  hecody put some more dirt on top of it so it could stand up nice and straight.  ha ha ha.  good, cody. good, mommy.  cody knows that plants need sunlight to grow, so he found a nice, sunny spot for his bean plant, and he watered it.  cody kept watering the bean plant, and it kept growing.  he watered and watered and watered, and the bean plant grew and grew and grew.  what a beautiful plant.  great job, cody. ha ha ha.  there.  look.  elmo liked cody's bean plant so much elmo's growing one, too, and while we wait for it to grow, we can find out more about flowers, plants, and trees, but how can we find out more.  hmm.  ahh. ha ha ha.  hey. yeah. that's right.  we can watch the flower, plant, and tree channel.  go on, tv.  the flower, plant, and tree channel, all flowers, all plants, all trees.  we're growing all the time, and now the tree lady.  hello, plant lovers.  it's me the tree lady.  today on the flower, plant, and tree channel, i'm going to show you how to pretend to be a tree.  don't worry. you can do it.  it's easy as 1, 2, tree.  anyway, all you have to do is use your imagination.  are you ready.  then let's pretend.  first, imagine you've got roots that go deep into the ground.  are you imagining.  i am.  can't be a tree withoutoots.  that's how you get water and food from the ground.  are you rooted.  now imagine you've got a nice, strong trunk made out of wood.  trees are made out of wood, you know.  ready for more.  good.  pretend that long branches and limbs are growing out from your trunk, also made ofyou guessed itwood.  beautiful.  now comes the bark.  got to have bark.  now something's missing.  oh, right. the leaves.  can't leave out the leaves.  there. we did it.  we're trees.  you're really great at pretending.  that's it, i think.  i guess i can go now.
