made a mess by spilling food.  what's our solution.  when someone spills food at my house, my mom wipes it with a paper towel or a napkin.  like this.  telly, you're a genius.  let's do it.  how did we do.  gaaaaaaaah.  hey, baby bear. yeah.  you want to see my picture.  no. i mean, yes, i do, but not now.  i got ice cream on my shirt, and i got to get it off.  i tried to wipe it off with this napkin, but it only made it worse.  well, did you dip the napkin in water first.  that's what my mommy always does.  zoe, you're a genius.  let's do it.  ok.  problem solved.  ..  gaaaaaaah.  uh, pardon me, but i couldn't help but overhear the sounds of someone in distress.  it's baby bear.  he promised papa bear he wouldn't get his clothes dirty.  then he spilled ice cream on his shirt.  we tried wiping it off with a napkin, but it only made it worse.  then we tried wiping it off with a wet napkin, and that made it even worse.  well, did you try taking it down to the river and betting it on the rocks.  .  in the old daysi mean, the rotten old days before they invented yucky stuff like soap and laundry powder, people would clean their clothes by beating them on the rocks in the local river.  we don't have a local river.  no, no, but i'll bet we can come up with a rock.  let's see. ah. here we are.  ok. look. this is perfect.  so shall we give it a try.  yeah. at this point, i'll try anything.  oh, that's the spirit, fur ball.  so off with the shirt and on with the cleaning.  heh heh heh.  ok.  clipon.  papa bear worked so hard on that knot.  ok. yeah. ok. let's get it ready

different kind of rock they used in those rotten, old days.  nothing ventured, nothing gained, right, baby bear. heh heh.  what am i gonna do.  what am i gonna do.  hey, baby bear. what's the matter.  what's the matter.  remember how i told you that papa bear told me not to get my clothes dirty no matter what.  mmhmm.  look at my shirt.  ay, mama.  you should try to clean it, baby bear.  try to clean it.  what do you think we've been trying to do.  we rubbed it with a napkin, it got worse.  we rubbed it with a wet napkin.  it got worse.  we beat it with a rock.  it got worse.  you beat it with a rock.  don't ask.  i'll tell you what you need.  you need a vacuum cleaner.  a vacuum cleaner.  mmhmm.  a vacuum cleaner.  rosita, you're a genius.  let's do it.  ok. i'll be right back.  ahh. i'm saved.  it's all gonna be ok.  ha ha ha.  ok. here we go.  clean up the shirt.  ok. the red thing.  yes. what a plan.  oh. oh. a little help.  oh, oh. a little help.  oh, oh, ohh.  whoa. ok. you got it.  yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  i got it. i don't have it.  i got it. i got it.  aah.  so, uh, how'd we do.  ..  ohh. look at it.  it's hopeless.  no. no. no, it's not.  what do you mean "no, it's not".  zoe. yeah.  have you got any of that purple paint in those little purple bottles you had before.  yeah, i got them right here.  let me take a look at that.  ok.  you mean, like this.  that's it. ok, then.  if we can't get the dirt and gunk and most importantly this purple stain out of the white shirt, how about if we try to make the dirty white shirt purple.  what are you talking about.  i will show you.  come on, everybody.   da da dee    hmm   ha ha ha.  looks good. yes.  telly, you are a genius.  no.  now help me get on before papa bear comes.  wait, wait, wait. hang on.  you got to wait until it dries.  wait until it dries.  how long does that take.  uh, let's see.  little paint thing here says 2 to 3wait a minute.  this part has some paint on it.  2 to 3 hours.  .  papa
