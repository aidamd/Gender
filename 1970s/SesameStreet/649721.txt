but, ihi, everybody.  hi, gabi.  hi, marco. how's my little buddy.  gabi, gina tells us you're a wonderful babysitter, and we were wondering, would you be able to babysit for us tonight.  of course she can't babysit.  this is such short notice.  no, no, no.  i'm sure gabi has big plans for tonight, right, gabi.  well, actually, i'm not busy at all.  oh, that's great.  ohh.  don't worry.  we'll have a great time together.  oh, you see that. it all worked out, right.  i don't know about this.  i mean, grandmama bear is the only ..well, uh, you know.  uh, curly.  curly bear might not be too happy about it.  gabi. gabi. gabi. gabi.  she seems to be fine with the idea.  now let's all go home and get ready.  come on, family.  i'm not so sure about this.  i think you need to think this through.  can i see your car.  thanks, mama bear.  how does it look.  you look very handsome.  gabi, gabi, gabi.  yes, that's right.  gabi will be here any minute.  yup.  i still think we should reconsider.  you know, maybe you should just go out another night, papa bear.  you know, when grandmama bear is feeling better.  is something bothering you, son.  you seem upset.  me. no, no, no.  no, no, no. i'm fine.  don't you want gabi to babysit.  well, of course i do, papa bear.  i'm just worried about curly bear.  i'm not sure that she is going to like having a new babysitter, that's all.  oh, i see.  but curly knows gabi, and she likes her, doesn't she.  yeah, she loves her, but gabi never babysat before.  this is a whole new ballgame.  it's always been grandmama bear.  and, you know, this is such a drastic change, it could be very upsetting, uh, to curly bear.  gabi, gabi, gabi, gabi.  she seems to be ok with it.  well, she may look ok, but believe me, underneath, she's a bundle of nerves.  now, don't worry, son.  curly bear will be fine.  just give her time.   oh, there she is now. i'll go let her in.  yay. yay. yay. gabi, gabi, gabi.  uhoh.  well, hello, gabi dear.  it's so good to see you.  gabi, gabi, gabi.  what a nice greeting, curly.  come on in, gabi.  make yourself at home.  hey, baby bear.  i'm so excited to be babysitting you two today.  uh, gabi, come here.  i think you should know that curly bear is a wee bit nervous about all of this.  gabi.  she is.  mmhmm.  oh, well, don't worry, curly.  we're gonna have a lot of fun tonight.  ok, we better get going.  we have reservations at the szechuan porridge palace.  oh, gabi, the kids have already had their dinner, but they can have a snack.  oh, and our cell phone numbers are on the fridge.  ok.  come on, mama bear.  wait. you can't go yet.  ..you forgot to give curly bear a hug.  oh, of course. come here, little curly.  bye. bye. gabi. gabi. gabi.  oh, thanks, mama bear.  i love you.  all right, you guys, have a good time.  see you later.  ..i...  gabi, gabi.  well, what should we do first.  how about we play a game.  wait. hold on a second.  this is not what grandmama bear does first when she babysits.  no.  no, gabi, no.  there is a certain protocol here.  yes, first grandmama bear always makes us our favorite bear snacksporridge raisin cookies.  oh, well, i actually don't know how to make those.  you don't.  uhoh.  this is a real problem, uh, you know, for curly bear because she had her heart set on porridge raisin cookies.  well, better call mama bear and papa bear and tell them to come home.  oh, wait, baby bear, it's ok.  i brought us a healthy snack.  granola bars.  granola bars.  ugh.  nut n' honey flavor.  do you want to try one.  yeah. yeah, yeah.  i'm telling you, gabi, curly is not going to go for this.  no, she is used to having porridge raisin cookies when grandmama bear babysits and this is justthis is just ..this is... yummy.  she likes it. she does.  do you want to try one, baby bear.  uh, well, i guess i am a wee bit hungry.  i guess i could try a nibble.  let's see.  hey, it's pretty good.  it's not bad.  oh, that was terrific.  well, at you liked it.  so what do you want to do next.  well, normally when grandmama bear babysits, this is the time when she sings us golden oldie bear songs.  hey, can you do that, gabi.  i don't know any golden oldie bear songs.  oh, great.  now look, curly bear is really gonna be upset.  huh.  well, gabi, we gave it a try, a valiant effort, but obviously this whole babysitting thing is justit's not gonna work out, so call mama bear and papa bear and have them come right home.  well, why don't we make up our own new bear song.  yeah. a new bear song.  i don't know about this.  come on, let's find some music.   ah, this is great.  i don't' know.  this music doesn't sound very bearish to me.  baby bear, it can be.  all we have to do is make up some bear words and move to the music.  are you with me.  yeah.  you can do it, too.   now everybody everywhere    get on up out of your chair   all right, all right.   come on, stand up    i've got a song that we all can share    and it's called the bear   no, i'm sorry, but this is not at all like grandmama bear's songs.  baby bear, hang on.   now everybody everywhere    wave your paws up in the air    hey, ho    hey, ho    shake 'em like you just don't care    and now you're doing the bear   well, i guess that part was a wee bit bearish.   now everybody everywhere    growl as loud as you may dare   growl.  growl.   shake your fur and mess your hair    and now you're doing the bear   hey, you know, this is kind of fun.  now let's put it all together.  come on.   now everybody everywhere    wave your paws up in the air    shake 'em like you just don't care    shake your fur and mess your hair    growl as loud as you may dare   growl.  growl.   and now we've done the bear   yeah.   and we've done the bear    everybody everywhere oh, it's over.  gabi, that was great.  you see, curly bear, even new bear songs can be fun.  right.  so what should we do next.  how about we play a game now.  i mean, if that's what you and your grandmama do.  as a matter of fact, it is.  this is the time when we play some fun bear games.  bear games.  yay.  i don't know any bear games.  ah, well, i see.  .. well, i guess that's ok.  you know, curly bear, we don't have to do everything the way we do it with grandmama bear.  you see, curly bear, it's important to open our minds to new experiences.  huh.  hmm. so let's see what we can play.  how about tag or hide and go seek.  maybe we could even build a blanket tent.  yes, let's do that.  which.  all of them.  yay.  ..  tag, you're it.  ha ha ha.  ring around the rosie   peekaboo.  it's close.  it's a bunny rabbit.  bunny.  we're home.  what. already.  mama. papa.  hello, little curly bear.  did you have fun.  oh, it was great.  we had the hot and sour porridge.  wasn't too hot, wasn't too sour.  it was just right.  and how did everything go here.  great.  greater than great.  it wasn't at all like when grandmama bear babysits, but, you know, mama and papa bear, things can be different and still be fun.  oh.  so curly wasn't too upset, then.  well, at first, she was a wee bit nervous about having a new babysitter, but i helped her through it.  oh.  that's my boy.  it's time for me to get going.  oh, no, no, gabi.  we want you to stay.  please stay.  really.  well, i had such a good time with you guys.  i wish i could.  so maybe we can have gabi babysit again sometime.  oh,
