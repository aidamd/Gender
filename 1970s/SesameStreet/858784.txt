you start, ask a grownup to preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  first, we take a large bowl.  then you add 1 cup of brown sugar, 3/4 cup of unsweetened applesauce, and 1 egg white.  some grownups are more helpful than others.  next, add 1 cup of raisins, even though i prefer 2 cups.  after that, in a medium bowl, add 1 1/2 cups of flour, 2 cups of rolled oats, 1 teaspoon baking soda, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, then mix the ingredients of the 2 bowls together.  finally, spoon the batter onto the cookie sheet into a proper cookie shape.  have a grownup put the cookies into the oven and then let them bake for 15 minutes.   when the cookies are done, have a grownup take the cookies out of the oven.  be careful, because they're hot.  let them cool for 10 minutes and then they're ready to eat.  i like mine with milk.  what do you like to drink with your cookies.  mmm.  hey.   i'm jessica, and i'm here to tell you all about the word " isn't scrumptious a great word.  i love it.  do you know
