thank you, computer.  elmo's friend kate loves dinosaurs, so her mommy took her to the museum so she could see huge dinosaur bones, and she told elmo all about it.  dinosaurs aren't alive anymore, so you have to go to a museum to see them like the american museum of natural history.  scientists called paleontologists dig up the fossils of dinosaur bones, and they put together skeletons, which show how big they were.  one of the first skeletons we saw was awesome.  it's called a barosaurus.  when i looked up at it, i felt tiny.  it has the longest neck of any dinosaur found in north america.  we found triceratops with 3 big horns and a big collar.  we also saw dinosaur eggs.  how could something as big as a dinosaur grow from something that small.  tyrannosaurs rex.  it has tiny arms and big legs and sharp teeth.  they're sharp because it eats meat.  we found stegosaurus.  i think it's the cutest.  i like the plates on its back.  the last one we saw, the apatosaurus, was humongous, and it was put together from 350 dinosaur bones.  there's a makebelieve skeleton we put together just like paleontologists do.  maybe i'll be a paleontologist someday.  hmm. paleontologist.  paleontologist, paleontologist.  where can elmo learn more about a paleontologist.  oh, ho ho. yeah.  whoa. a tvasaur.  elmo can learn more on the dinosaur channel.  oh. come on, tv.  ha ha. ok. turn yourself on.  it's the dinosaur channel, all dinos, all newts all the time.  dino devotees, here's paleontologist bones martin digging up dirt about dinosaurs.  hi. i'm bones martin, and i'm a paleontologist.  i dig dinosaurs.  and i make dino skeletons.  kazam.  and here's a secret about dinosaurs.  dinosaurs moved.  they were alive.  they didn't just stand in some museum waiting for closing time.  these legs were meant for walking and running and, yes, dancing. hit it.   swing your tail from side to side    swing it, show some dino pride    stamp those feet upon the ground    make the earth shake all around you    give your tail another whomp    stamp your feet and start to romp   paleontology in motion.   that's doing the dinosaur stomp   let's get real.  it's an ampelosaurus and the dinettes.
