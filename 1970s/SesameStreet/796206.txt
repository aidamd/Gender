let's all hurry to the flying fairy school    grab your wands   yeeha.   bring your wings  yeah.   we will learn magic things    let's all hurry to the flying fairy school    how to make us grow    and how to make us shrink   whoa.   how to solve a problem with a simple twinkle think    the school is really magic    and magic's really cool    let's go in, let's begin    it's flying fairy school   ha ha ha.  ha ha.  hello. welcome to flying fairy school.  today, we're on a field trip to colonial trolliamsberg.  yay. ha ha.  we're going to play real troll games and hear true troll stories and listen to authentic troll music.  ha ha.  you're halftroll, blogg.  tell us what it's like.  yeah, yeah.  trolliamsberg, schmolliamsberg.  oh, well, i wouldn't call it schmolliamsberg, blogg.  in fact, a trip to colonial trolliamsberg can be quite smashing.  now please discontinue use of all wands and return your desks to their full and upright position.  the school is coming in for a landing.  all right, class. follow me.  halt. aah.  you cannot cross the bridge into colonial trolliamsberg until you answer a riddle.  a riddle is tricky enough, but a troll riddle.  we'll never be able to figure this out.  oh, sure, we will.  blogg knows everything there is to know about being a troll.  hmm. what do you know.  a troll with wings.  wings. no. these aren't wings.  huh.  they're, um, uhoh, armpit coolers.  yeah. ha ha. see.  oh, how curiously refreshing.   you mind sprucing up your pits somewhere else, kid.  it's burning my retinas.  well, it looks like blogg isn't up for any riddles.  why don't you fairies try to figure it out yourselves.  great idea.  what's the riddle, mr. bridge troll sir.  ahem.  what has one line down and one line across and you need it to tickle and tie and toss.  boy, this is a tough riddle.  i wonder what's the same about tickle and tie and toss.  looks like we can use some help to spot the solution.  oh, spot, spot.   ha ha ha.  what has one line down and one line across and you need it to tickle and tie and toss.  fetch, spot, fetch.   what does the alphabet have to do with solving our problem.  let's twinkle think.  twinkle think, twinkle think, twinkle think.  i got it. ohh.  the alphabet has letters.  maybe the answer is a letter.  let's think this through.  one line down and one line across.  ttt, ttt tickle, ttt, ttt tie.  "t" begins the words tickle and tie and toss.  the answer has to be the letter "t".  yeah.  right you are, and "t" also begins ticket, and that answer is your ticket to trolliamsberg.  whoohoo. yay.   eee. eep.  eee. ha ha.  whoa, whoa, whoa.  no flash photography.  eep eep.  blogg, why did you say your wings aren't wings.  no reason.  come one, come all.  estimate how many trolls it takes to make an ear wax candle.  heh heh heh.  estimate.  it's a thoughtful guess.  aw. i can't guess something like that.  ask blogg. he's a troll.  he'll know.  whoa. a troll with wings.  wings. no. these aren't wings.  they're, umooh. it's a backpack.  hee hee.  see. nothing out of the ordinary here.  no, siree.  looks like blogg isn't in an estimating mood.  anyone else care to take a guess.  ok. i'll give it a shot.  the candle holder's kind of big, and trolls have kind of big ears with quite a lot of ear wax, so i'll guess 6.  and i estimatehmm3.  now let's find out how many trolls it takes to make an ear wax candle.  whoa, whoa, whoa.  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  6.  whoa. 6 trolls it is.  you estimated right, gonnigan.  oh.  and you win the candle.  ohh.  eep eep.  aah.  ehh. no flash photography.  eep eep eep.  garfunkel the griffinnext show in 5 minutes.  holy parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme.  we're going to see garfunkel.  whoohoo. come on, blogg.  let me slip into something more comfortable first.  ooh. cozy.  ahh.  ladies and gentlemen, the art of garfunkel.  ooh.   ohh.   ohh.   don't panic, everyone.  a troll just needs to whisper the words "nap time" in his ear, and all we will hear are the sounds of silence from garfunkel.  ahem. nap time.   nap time.   whispering from down here is not doing the job.  maybe i can solve this problem.  nap time.   sorry, little fairy liebchen, but it has to be a troll who whispers the words.  blogg, is there anyone you know who might be able to help in a situation like this.  but they'll see my wings.  they'll see that i'm different.  sometimes, differences make the difference.  huh. aah.   you can do it, blogg. you're the troll.  and the fairy.   nap time.    wow. look at those wings.  you're the coolest guy i've ever seen.  let's

chart.  telephone.  hand.  duck bird. hee hee.  then she held the pictures in front of me.  and i told her what i saw.  cake.  then the doctor moved a little puppet in front of me, and i followed it with my eyes.  then she used something called a retinascope to look in my eyes.  it has a bright light.  the doctor wanted to make sure that i could see colors.  so i had to find the colored shapes in a book.  circle, square.  after that, she used a different light to look into my eyes to make sure they're growing ok.  then she put drops in my eyes.  .  wow.  the drops made my pupils bigger so she could look all the way at the back of my eyes.  then the eye exam was over.  but the doctor said i needed glasses to see better.  i got to pick out my own eyeglass frame.  i picked some really nice ones.  i like my new glasses.  so does my mom and my friends.  elmo loves elizabeth's glasses, too.  now elmo wants to learn even more about eyes, don't you.  how could we find out even more.  oh. oh.
