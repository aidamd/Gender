together, they go everywhere    amigos like to go    mmmurray    he follows her to school each day    they run, they spin, they leap    go, murray    yo, everybody loves to see    a monster and his sheep    and they all say    murray has a little lamb   i am totally psyched to go to school today, but where's my little lamb.  hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm. hee hee hee.  i can't find her.  whoa. ha ha ha.  hi, ovejita. .hola, murray.  what school are we going to today.  hmm.   what's ovejita doing.  handstand.  hey, yeah, a handstand.  but what kind of school do you need a handstand for.  ooh. i know.  i know where we're going.  ..  gymnastics school.  escuela de gimnasia.  yay.  in a little while, we're gonna learn some gymnastics at gymnastics school, but right now, let's watch this.  he observes.  oh, look.  no. oh, no. aah.  he questions.  hubbawha.  he investigates.  hmm. what does this button do.  aah.  super grover 2.0he shows up.   at a school gym just hoursbefore the big game, this cheer squad can't stoprahrahrocking back and forth.  from the top.  we're the squad that's full of talents.  hear us cheer and watch us balance.  whoa, whoa, whoa.  ohh.  aww. that happens every time.  we always fall whenever we try that move.  we need help.  isn't there anybody that can help us so we can balance and not fall over.  aaaaaah.  ohh. never fear.  ..  somewhere under this capehere.  ha.  um, are you a substitute or something.  nonsense. i am super grover 2.0.  now what seems to be the problem.  every time we try to do our balancing cheer, like, we fall over.  i just can't seem to balance them.  so the question is how do you balance the pompomed poultry without falling over.  well, stand back while irahrah sisboombahunleash my powers of observation.  ha ha.  hmm.  i observe with my supereyesthat you have 2 arms.  1, 2, yes, i do.  tsk, tsk, tsk. just as i suspected.  .  you clearly have a case of floppy arm.  oh, ohh, ohh.  that is when 1 arm is strong like, well, an elephant and the other, eh, not so much.  that arm over there is clearly your strong arm.  you know, now that you mention it, that arm does feel stronger.  now i shallrahrah sisboombahunleash the power of investigation.  if i am correct, then when all the chickadees jump to this side, your strong arm will hold all the weight, and you shall be perfectly balanced.  that is my hypothesis.  super grover, you're, like, amazing.  aw. it is what i do.  now let us investigate, and show me that cheer.  everybody line up on this side only.  here we go.  we're the squad that's full of talents.  hear us cheer and watch us balance.  whoa, whoa, whoa.  ohh.  ugh.  maybe in order to havebalance, we can't have all the weight on one side.  we need to have an equal amount of weight on both sides.  or what if in order to balance we had an equal amount of weight on both sides.  great idea, super grover.  i just said that.  and by unleashing my powers of observation, i see there are 1, 2, 3, 4 chickens.  so if we just put half of the chickens on one side1, 2and half on the other side1, 2you will be perfectly balanced.  i'm not really sure that's how it works.  2 chickens on this side, 2 cute, little chickens on this side.  they must weigh the same.  ok. everybody ready.  whoa, whoa, whoa.  i'm just going to stand over here if you do not mind.  ha ha ha.  ok.  we're the squad with lots of talents.  hear us cheer and watch us balance.  it worked.  ah ha ha. see. i was right.  sorry.  ohh.  i think if we want tobalance by weight i think we need some sort of tooto measure our weight.  a tool, you say.  stand back.  ..  unleash, unleashthe power of technology.  let me check my utility sock.  heh heh.   wedge of cheeseno.  picklethat'sfor lunch later.  oh. this thing fromthat lawyer show.   no, no. wait. what.  that is a scale.  yes. yes, yes, it is.  wait. what is a scale again.  a scale is a tool to measure weight.  when the 2 sides are perfectly balanced, it means there's an equal amount of weight on each side.  oh, yeah.  i'm a large chicken, and i think i probably weigh more than the small chickens, so i'll get on this side.  ooh.  and we'll find out how many small chickens weigh the same as me.  buckaw.  1.  buck buck buckaw.  2.  buck buck buck buckaw.  3.  oh. look.  3 small chickens weighthe same as 1 large chicken.  the scale isperfectly balanced.  now let's try the cheer.  we're the squad that's full of talents.  hear us cheer and watch us balance.  perhaps the other arm is floppy.  .  you're balanced.  and so super grover learned that to stay balanced it helps to have an equal amount of weight on both sides.  big cheer for super grover 2.0.  ha ha. whoa.  ohh. now i am a little off balance.    jump up, get down    come dance with elmo    we're moving our body to the abcs    dance nearby    whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh    dance far away    now clap your hands    to the letter of the day    clap, clap    what's the letter,
