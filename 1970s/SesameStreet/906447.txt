way.  the giant ice block is the problem.  it is.  we can't do our penguin dance routine because this giant block of ice is on our dance floor.  do not worry, my wee waddling compadres, for i 0 will unleash my power of investigation.  oh. what's he going to do.  i wonder what would happen if i tickled the ice.  tickle, tickle, tickle.  coochycoochycoo.  i wonder what would happen if you gave it a push.  wait a minute.  waah.  i wonder what would happen if i gave it a push.  that's what i said.  behold as i investigate with a push.  ooh.   eh, it's really not moving much.  this giant block of ice appears to be very big and heavy.  ohh.  have no fear, little penguins.  i shall just use a little more force.  ooh.  hyaaahooh. ohh, ohh, ohh.  ohh.  who knew investigating could be so painful.  ouch.  we'll never dance again.  waah.  i am not giving up yet, my tuxedoed amigos.  it is time to unleash the power of technology.  huh.  i'm going to go get some tools to help me move the block of ice.  hey.  what.  check out the super grover mobile.  what about it.  it's big and heavy like the block of ice, but it moves.  yeah, yeah, but what makes it move so easily.  wheels.  ok. i am back now.  super grover, maybe you should try wheels.  you cannot hit a block of ice with wheels to move it, but you can hit it with a sturdy metal golf club.  what. oh, boy.  fore.  uhhhhyyyiii.  hyah. hyah.  i wonder if we could move the ice out of the way if it had wheels.  well, there's only way to find out.  come on, birds.  everybody grab a wheel.  wheel, wheel, wheel.  tada. unh.  sisboomba.

dah.  ok. ok. ok.  i got it, i got it.  yep, yep, yep. ahh.  unh. aah.  unh.  mmhmm.  all right, penguins.  now let's try moving this block of ice.  do not be silly.  if a super guy like me cannot move that block of ice, there is no way 4 little penguins can do it.  ha.   hubbawha.  the little penguins are moving it.  how are you moving that giant piece of ice.  wheels.  now come on, penguins.  let's dance. hit it.   waah waah waah waah waah waah waah    waah waah waah waah waah waah waah    waah waah waah waah waah waah waah    waah   well, my super work here is done.  i will just drive away in the super grover mobile.   um.   the super grover mobile is not moving.  why is the super grover mobile not moving.  unh.  and so our intrepid hero has discovered that if wheels can help move the super grover mobile they can make it easier to move other heavy things.  unh.  oh, oh.  i did learn that, didn't i.  anybody got any wheels.  it's almost time for elmo's world, but first i want to

elmo's friend elaine learned all about skin in school, and she told elmo all about it.  one day at school, michaelson asked our class what we could learn by looking at our skin.  so we started to investigate.  we could see that everybody's skin looked different.  there was dark skin, light skin, and all different shades in between.  my skin was dark, and cassie had light skin with rosy cheeks.  then we looked at our skin through a magnifying glass.  it makes things look bigger.  we could see all sorts of things we never noticed before.  there was hair growing out of our skin, and the fronts of our arms had more hair than the back of our arms, but the palms of our hands didn't have any hair at all, but they had lots of lines.  so did the tips of our fingers.  some parts of our skin were smooth like our cheeks.  some parts were real wrinkly like our knuckles and elbows.  then we ran some water on our arms to see what our skin looked like when it was wet.  the water didn't soak in.  it just rolled right off.  we could see how our skin protects our bodies.  so even though everybody's skin looked different up close, our skin wasn't really very different at all.  elaine learned a lot about skin, but elmo still wants to find out more, don't you.  how can we find out even more.  hmm.  ha ha ha.  elmo almost jumped out of his skin, tv.  oh. good idea.  we can watch the all about skin channel on tv.  now turn yourself on, tv.  thank you.  welcome to the all about skin channel.  when it comes to skin, we've got you covered, and now the story of the girl who loved her skin.  once a upon a time, there was a girl who loved her skin.  i love my skin.  she loved it so much that she took very good care of it.  when her skin got dirty, she washed it.  scrubadubdub.  when her skin was out in the sun, she put sunscreen on to protect it.  rubarubrub.  huh.  when her skin was cold, it got goose bumps, so she put on more clothes to warm her skin.  ahh.  and when her skin got hot, it sweated to help cool her off.  whew.  ahh.  when she went roller skating, she protected her skin with special padding, but one day, she fell down the girl's mother loved her skin, too, and knew just what to do.  she washed the booboo, put ointment on it, and covered it up with a bandage to keep it clean.  my skin feels better already.  and every day, the girl's skin felt better and better until one day the booboo was gone.  her skin had healed itself.  now i really, really love my skin.  and from then on, the girl who loved her skinreally, really loved.  the girl who really, really loved her skin took really, really good care of it, especially when roller skating.  you got to love the skin you're in.   i'm ok, and so is my skin.  the end.  coming up next on the all about skin channel,
