neighborhood nursery school.  first, we added the ingredients.  ..  and the oatmeal.  ..  ..  and milk.  my mom added an egg.  you have to be careful not to get any eggshell in the bowl.  then i helped mix.  and i helped put the dough on the cookie sheet.  it's not easy, because it's real sticky.  but we made a lot of cookies.  then my mom put the in the oven to bake.  the oven's really hot.  and when they were done, we had to let them cool.  they looked really good.  and they smelled good.  then i helped my mom put them in a box.  and we took them to the children at the nursery school for their snack time.  they really liked our cookies.  and their teacher thanked us for helping.  ..  and i like sharing.  wow. you were a great help.  elmo wants to learn more about helping.  don't you.
