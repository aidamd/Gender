 he's right, chris. 3.  amazing.  but keep beholding as 3 cards magically become 2 cards.  no.  1, 2.  that's not magic. 2 cards.  and as crazy and incredible as that is, you got to keep beholding.

incredible.  that was the best magic trick elmo has ever seen.  increible. bravo.  bravo.  max the magician, you had 5 cards, and now you have 0.  how did you ever do it.  uhuh now, bird.  you know that i can't ever tell you the secrets behind my magic.  magician's code of honor.  oh, please, please.  i'm sorry. never.  well, maybe we can figure it out.  well, you can try, but this is truly a trick of great mystery.  not even your friend over here could figure it out.  am i right.  ..  chris, chris, do you know how he did it.  yeah. tell us, chris. tell us, tell us.  yeah. tell us.  i just don't want to spoil it for you guys.  i couldn't do that. aw, come on.  no chance of that because you'll never guess it in a million years, so go on, tell us.  tell us what you think is the secret of the disappearing cards.  yeah. what is it.  ok. it's subtraction.  really.  you guessed it again.  wow. gosh. you've figured out another trick.  mmhmm.  you went to the magician's correspondence school, too, didn't you.  no. i thought i recognized you.  no. it wasn't me.  well, then how did you know it was subtraction.  yeah.  well, let me give you an example.  if ioh, wait.  i got my straws right here.  see this. now count them.  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5 straws.  now if i have all 5 straws and i subtract all of them, how many do i have left.  well, chris doesn't have any.  exactly. no straws, you see.  0 straws.  you made them all disappear at once.  that's a great trick, chris.  ah, thank you.  it's almost as great as my disappearing card trick.  oh, ok. almost.  are you sure you're not a magician.  heh heh heh.  uh, no.  well, maybe a math magician. heh heh.  well, whatever kind of magician you are, you'll never be able to guess how i do my next trick.  this trick has stumped audiences all over the world, and no one will ever, ever, ever figure it out.  gee. how about that chris.  i don't know.  oh. hello.  hey.  see that.  whoa.  whoa.  for my next magic trick, i will need a volunteer from the audience.  me, me, me, me. me, me, me.  you in the yellow feathers.  hey. that's me.  that's right.  now, my friend, as you can see, i have here 1 ordinary piece of rope, wouldn't you say.  yes. it looks pretty ordinary. mmhhm.  but now i, max the magician, will take this 1 piece of rope and turn it into 2 pieces of rope.  ohh.  now, my assistant, if you would please take this end of the rope right here.  ok. i've got it.  watch carefully as i turn this 1 piece of rope into 2 pieces of rope.  behold.  oh.  2 pieces of rope.  yay.  2 pieces of rope.  that was amazing.  thank you so much.  chris, how did he do that.  i'm not saying a thing this time.  no, no, no, no.  aw. thank you.  he possibly couldn't figure it out because nobody could ever possibly figure this one out.  it is one of the most mysterious and wondrous tricks that i've ever come up with.  excuse me.  i think maybe i figured it out.  but how. no, no, no.  you possibly couldn't have done it because you're so young.  there's no way.  no. i think i've got it.  now if i took one of these bread sticks and then break it in half, see.  1 piece becomes 1, 2, pieces.  oh. ha ha ha.  now that's what you did with the rope, right, max.  you cut it into 2 pieces.  that's right. i divided it.  i can't believe that you, a young bird, figured it out.  no one i've ever met has done that before.  really.  i just put 1 and 1 together.  i didn't mean to ruin your trick either.  well, that's ok, my feathered friend.  max the magician has another trick, right, right, right.  right, mr. max.  show us your next trick, par favor.  no. that was my very last trick.  your last trick.  are you sure.  yes. no more tricks up my sleeve.  look for yourself.  nope. nothing in there.  aw.  you guessed the secret of all my tricks.  nothing like this has ever happened to me before.  hey. sorry, max.  well, there's no need to be sorry.  you've been a great audience.  a little too great, but i like a challenge, for i am max the magician, the greatest magician of all time, and i'll find new tricks, trickier tricks, tricks that you've never even dreamed of.  i'll stump you yet. wait and see.

leevie takes violin lessons, and she told elmo all about it.  i'm learning how to play the violin, and my teacher is mrs. jimerson.  i have to be very careful with my violin.  my teacher doesn't want to hear a sound when i put it on the table.  i put something called rosin on the bow before i play the violin.  without rosin, there would be no sound at all.  my teacher taught me how to hold the violin in rest position and play position.  i'm learning how to play "twinkle, twinkle, " i practice on 2 strings.  ok.  and then i use my fingers to play the tune.  my teacher put tape on my violin so i know where to put my fingers to play different notes.  and i'm learning how to use different bow strokes.  legato.   which means a smooth stroke.  but what i like most is playing while my teacher plays with me on the piano.   i'm learning a lot, and i love to play the violin.  good job.  aw. great violin playing, leevie.  elmo wants to learn even more about violins, don't you.  how can we find
