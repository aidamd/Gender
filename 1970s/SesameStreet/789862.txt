prince after all.  boy, what a letdown.  it was more fun when the frog became a prince.  well, that was an enchanted fairy tale frog, abby.  one in a million.  most frogs are just frogs.  and if you kiss them.  they stay frogs and they like it.  a frog is what they want to be.  yeah, like i want to be a grouch. ha ha.   i don't want to be a prince    sitting on a throne    rather be a grouch

class what we can learn by looking at our skin.  so we started to investigate.  we could see that everybody's skin looked different.  there was dark skin, light skin, and all different shades in between.  my skin was dark, and cassie had light skin with rosy cheeks.  then we looked at our skin through a magnifying glass.  it makes things look bigger.  we could see all sorts of things we never noticed before.  there is hair growing out of our skin, and the front of our arms had more hair than the back of our arms, but the palms of our hands didn't have any hair at all, but they had lots of lines.  so did the tips of our fingers.  some parts of our skin were smooth, like our cheeks.  some parts were really wrinkly, like our knuckles and elbows.  then we ran some water on our arms to see what our skin looked like when it was wet.  the water didn't soak in.  it just rolled right off.  we could see how our skin protects our bodies.  so even though everybody's skin looked different up close, our skin wasn't really very different at all.  elaine learned a lot about skin, but elmo still wants to find out more.  don't you.  how can we find out even more.  boy, elmo almost jumped out

the girl who loved her skin.  once upon a time, there was a girl who loved her skin.  i love my skin. mwah, mwah, mwah.  she loved it so much that she took very good care of it.  when her skin got dirty, she washed it.  scrub a dub dub.  when her skin was out in the sun, she put sunscreen on to protect it.  rub a rub rub.  huh.   when her skin was cold, it got goose bumps, so she put on more clothes to warm her skin.  ahh.  and when her skin got hot, it sweated to help cool her off.  cool.  ah.  when she went rollerskating, she protected her skin with special padding, but one day she fell down and hurt her skin anyway.  oh, no. i got a boo boo on my skin.   the girl's mother loved her skin, too, and knew just what to do.  she washed the boo boo, put ointment on it, and covered it up with a bandage to keep it clean.  thanks, mom. my skin feels better already.  and every day, the girl's skin felt better and better until one day, the boo boo was gone.  her skin had healed itself.
