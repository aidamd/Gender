so the question is,how do you make a pile of fruit stay on top of a pedestal.  that's the question,all right.  and the answer is as easyas apple pie, no offense.  now stand back as i unleashthe power of design.  ooh.ooh.  what are you doing.  i am planning out howthe pedestal can fit the fruit.  i am designing. hmm.  oh, but i was goingto paint on that canvas.  it is all right.i do not mind sharing.  now, we have a pedestal.  so i just need to designsomething to make the top big enough to holdall the fruit, something like this.   is that a cow.  realistic, is it not.i am naturally artistic.  ah, be right back.  ..  let's get you on up there.  there is a cow in my studio.  of course there is.she is part of my design.  but can all the fruitpile on top of the cow.  there is only

understand it.  there is plenty of roomon the cow.  well, i observe thatthe cow's back curves down.  so.so we just roll right off.  yeah.oh, i see.  well, back to the farmfor you, bessie.  moo.yep.  oh, i will never paintmy masterpiece.  do not despair,my perturbed pineapple.  a superhero never gives up.  i just need to design somethingthat's big enough to hold all of the fruit,but does not curve down so the fruit will not roll off,something like this.  oh, a surfboard.  where are you going to geta surfboard.  in my utility sock, of course.hmm.  just a sec.  aha.  you carry that in your sock.  you never know when you mayneed to hang 10.  now, let us try it out.  as you can see, is niand big and flat.  you see, it does not cve dow all right,you problematic produce.  pile on the surfboard.

something that curves up on the sides.  what, are you bananas.  no. he's the banana.i'm a pear.  yeah. i know that.hey, yeah.  something that's bigand curves up on the sides may hold all of us fruitinto place.  what do you say.  do you mind if we unleashmy power of design.  eh, be my guest.all right.  in the meantime,i'll just go get a snack.  yeah.  there. see.  i designed a bowlon top of the pedestal.  ah.oh.  who wants some popcorn.  hey, it's a bowl.  it's big, and it curves up onboth sides just like the design.  hmm.  what did i do.  this way.  oh, i see.  pile in.  ooh. ooh.ho ho.
