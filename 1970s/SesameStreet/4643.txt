meow. meow.  from the nursery rhyme.  they're the 3 little kittens who lost their mittens.  they know all about losing stuff.  they lose their mittens all the time.  so, so what do you do when you lose something, kittens.  we cry.  did you hear that, gordon.  they cry.  there's nothing else to do.  let me tell you my story.  it's the saddest story ever.   i was a happy little kitten    who was smitten with a mitten    i thought it was the cat's meow   meow.   then one day when i was knittin'    you know, i lost that mitten    that's why i'm crying now    right now    wahh, wahh, wahh, wahh, wahh, wahh    poor little kitten am i    wahh, wahh, wahh, wahh, wahh, wahh    all i can do is cryy      i'm so sad, my heart is splittin'    never got a chance to say goodbye    goodbye    i can't help but admittin'    when a kitten's lost their mitten    the only thing to do is cry    cry, cry    wahh, wahh, wahh, wahh, wahh, wahh    poor little kitten am i    wahh, wahh, wahh, wahh, wahh,

you're not a kitten    no need to sit and wonder why      it seems much more benefitin'    and it's not exactly quittin'    if you all you want to do is cryy    wahh, wahh, wahh, wahh, wahh, wahh    poor little kitten am iii    wahh, wahh, wahh, wahh, wahh, wahh    all i can do is cryy   wahh.  see, gordon. you're not alone.  we've all lost our mittens.  wahhhhhh.  but i didn't lose my mittens.

my way of announcing that today is opposite day.  opposite day. yes.  we'll be learning all about opposites, when things are as different from each other as they can be.  oh, sure. i know about opposites.  ..  is slow.  ..  is down.  and the opposite of warm isear wax.  .  yeah. my ear wax is warm.  body temperature to be exact.  eww. gross.  maybe we can help blogg understand opposites through magic.  now you're talking my language.  we can do a simple opposite spell, which will turn anything into its opposite, and you can do it, too.  just point your wand or your finger and say, " ooh. see. this paper clip is small.  let's do the opposite spell on it.  opposite.  whoa. so the opposite of small is big.  now let's do the opposite spell on that open door.  opposite.  d'oh. and the opposite of open is closed.  i get it.  now what i can do the opposite spell on.  hey. how about you.  no. i don't want to be the opposite.  whoa.  come on, gonnigan.  hold still.  gonnigan. where's gonnigan.  he's gone again.  there he is.  opposite.  aah.  blogg, are you ok.  quite all right, thank you, although i do feel rather musty.  ha ha ha. much better.  wait a minute.  i think blogg got hit with his own spell.  let's check.  blogg, how do you feel about ear wax.  repulsive.  toe nail clippings.  disgusting.  burping.  how uncouth.  oh, no. he's opposite blogg.  aah.  i know you're upset about being the opposite of yourself.  i am not upset about that.  i am upset about how filthy niblet is.  huh.  come. i shall give you a thorough cleansing.  eep.  boy, blogg sure is different.  yeah, but isn't it great.  opposite blogg means no more messes, no more burps, no more stinky cheese.  i guess.  there. squeaky clean.  eep.  literally.  great. come on, my neat and hygienic friend.  let's go play.  oh, splendid. what shall we play.  we can work on the block castle we started yesterday.  yeah. this is a beauty.  it's gonna be the biggest block castle anyone's everblogg, what are you doing.  cleaning up our mess.  one shouldn't leave one's toys out, you know.  but we worked so hard on it.  and now we must work hard at putting each block neatly away.  wait. stop.  uh, let's play something else instead.  uh, good idea.  how about dressup.  very well. i do enjoy a fancy frock.  i'm a police officer.  i'm a firefighter.  aah.  i'm horrified.  we can't wear these costumes.  they're terribly wrinkled.  uh, maybe we should forget about playing and just have a snack instead.  eep, eep, eep.  aah.  what now.  niblet's gotcrumbs in his fur.  this gerbilcornmust be cleaned.  eeeep.  eep.   i never thought i'd say this, but i miss the old blogg.  me, too.  he may have been messy, but at least he was fun.  i wish he would go back to the way he was.  hey. i know.  we could just do the opposite spell on him.  that would make him the opposite of the way he is now, which is the way he used to be.  opposite. opposite.  did it work.  hold still, niblet.  we need to rinse and repeat.  it didn't work.  i'm afraid it won't work if you do the spell.  blogg did the original opposite spell on himself.  he has to be the one to undo it.  now do try not to get dirty again.  eep.   blogg, it's great to be clean and all, but don't you think it's time to back to being your old messy self again.  no, thank you.  i enjoy being clean and tidy.  now if you will excuse me, i must go and sanitize the hand sanitizer.  blogg really wants to stay like this.  hehe's not gonna do the opposite spell on himself.  how can we convince blogg to go back to the way he was.  maybe we just have to remind him of something he used to love like something gross or something that smells really bad.  well, let's twinkle think.  what gross, stinky thing did blogg really love.  twinkle think,twinkle think, twinkle think.  the cheese.  blogg's stinkycheese should do the trick.  hey, blogg.  remember this.  aah.  what a horrible odor.  that nasty cheese must be thrown a way forth hence.  eep.  niblet, no.  eeh. ooh.  oh, dear.  blogg will never want to go back to the way he was.  he'll be opposite blogg forever.  oh, no, mr. niblet.  you've made yourself dirty again.  time for another bath.  eep, eep, eep, eep, eep.  zounds. what's the matter with niblet.  i think he misses the old blogg.  ugh. who would ever miss him.  we all do.  he might have been gross, but the old blogg was fun, and the old blogg liked to play.  the old blogg was a great friend.  oh, dear.  i do love to clean, but i miss playing with my friends.  i suppose i know now what i must do. )
