sean went to see a frog exhibit at the museum, and he told elmo all about it.  i love frogs, so one day, my dad took me to the frog exhibit at the american museum of natural history.  they had frogs from all over the world.  i never saw so many kinds of frogs.  there were poison dart frogs from central america.  their bright colors are a sign for animals to stay away, danger, don't touch.  there were big frogs like the african bullfrog.  it's bigger than both my hands.  and there are little frogs.  the golden mantella frog is the size of a penny.  most frogs live in or near water.  they're pretty good swimmers, but some frogs don't live near water.  my dad showed me a picture of a frog that actually lives in the desert.  the mexican dumpy frog is a tree frog.  tree frogs, of course, live in trees.  they have sticky feet that help them stick to the branches and occasionally to another frog.  it took me a while to spot the vietnamese mossy frog.  they're camouflaged to blend in with the things around them.  there are two frogs on that moss.  can you see them.  frogs eat mostly bugs and worms.  they're really good shots with their tongues, but sometimes, they miss.  i even saw a chinese gliding frog.  they have special feet that help them leap and glide from tree to tree.  i love frogs.  frogs are my favorite kind of animal.  aw, thanks, sean.  ooh. the museum sure has a lot of frogs.  now elmo wants to learn more about frogs, don't you.  how can we learn even more.  ooh. elmo knows.  we can watch the frog channel on tv.  tv, where are you.  tv, yoohoo.  ha ha ha.

peeperazzi.  tell us, jumpy, how did you get to be a frog.  tell us. tell us.  i wasn't always a frog, you know.  i started out the same way you did.  no.  yes. i was born in this very pond.  i was just an egg drifting in the water, but deep inside, i felt a change coming, and one day, it happened.  i became a tadpole.  i had little gills for breathing and a mouth and tail, and soon, i started to swim, but knew i could be more than a tadpole.  that's when my life changed.  i started to grow legs, my body got longer, my head looked more like, well, a head.  before i knew it, i had arms and a tail.  but i still wasn't all that i could be.  after a while, i lost my tail, and i hopped out of the pond.  and you became a frog.  that's how we became frogs, too.  my story is your story, except i wanted more.  that's why i became a singer.  sing for us, jumpy.  sure.   forget your troubles    come on, get hoppy    leap all your cares away   that frog's a born singer.  next on the frog channel
