"horrible aliens." we better go tell 'em there aren't any.  gallio. what are you doing here. oh, i'm gonna try and talk to the aliens with this device. that's ridiculous. you couldn't call a fish with that thing. *but he called starfish this time* starfish.. shoo. scat. oh dear, i must've set it wrong. i'll say. *the starfish finally leave* now, if i just adjust the pitch, it will call larger
