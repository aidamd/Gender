 how's your famous chilli con kelp coming along, dad. the test is in the tasting, son. *tastes it, and it's so hot it makes him jump back down* phew. pretty good kick. could use a little salt, though. *tries doing that* oh, tidepools. not a lick of salt.&nbsp. on't pop your snork, dad. i'll jet some a the seapermarket. *leaves* *cutting some flowers* allstar, make that two bars of salt. these searaniums could use some perking up. sure thing, mom. and jet back soon. don't worry, i'm starved.  hey, watch where you're snorking, allwet. back in line, buster. we're all tryin' to get in the market to buy salt. since when do you have to wait in line to buy sea salt. haven't you been paying attention to the salt market lately. *pulls out a random map* salt has risen to ten times its normal price, and keeps on climbing. i'm gonna buy all i can, and sell it at a later profit.&nbsp. figures. i better go see my uncle gallio he'll know what's going on. yeah, sure. maybe gallio has a hot tip on the salt market. a wetworth leaves nothing to chance. *leaves*  sometimes, it just happens. every now and then, the ocean has a temporary salt drought. we just have to wait it out. but why wait, uncle gallio. it says here the rare deepwater neandersnorks salt the oceans from their cliffside caves.&nbsp. nonsense. that's just a book of legends, allstar. neandersnorks don't really exist. but at times like this, i wish they did. look, i have half a bar left. you're welcome to it if you like. *then feels faint* ncle gallio, are you alright. *catches him as has him sit down* moans* i'm fine, just a little dehydrated.  here, uncle gallio. you need this more than dad's chilli, but thanks anyway. something has to be done about this salt situation. *leaves and slams the door on junior unknowingly* oh allstar, wait up. *follows him into the nearest salt mines* you'll be glad i came along. *to audience* and so will i. *laughs*  hey, how come it's so dark. junior, the deeper you go, the darker it gets. oh, i wish you'd told me that before. *lays down to rest* i'm too pooped to snork, allstar. i'll just stay at this cave. it should be far enough, if the neandersnorks exist. they must be around here somewhere. just keep a lookout for the saltfish. wherever salt is, you're bound to have at least one or two. they're usually blue with yellow stripes. sees them pass by and out of the cave* allstar, look at that. look at what. a saltfish. i, i just saw one go behind your back and into that cave. hurry. a saltfish. *goes into cave* good job, junior. laughs* what a sucker. *goes into the other cave to sea some salt for himself* look at all this salt. i'll be so rich, my dad will have to ask me for an allowance. now to jet out of this creepy place. *bumps into allstar's light* relax, junior, it's only me. my tunnel led into this one. did you find any salt in here. *tries hiding it from him* salt. oh, salt. no, no i didn't see any, and i'm tired of looking for it. time to go home. go home.. but what about that noble talk about helping me save the town. you were right. you don't need an assistant, bye. *tries to leave* *sees a saltfish pass him by* i should've known. junior, get back here. *runs into guards* excuse me. yikes. i said excuse me. hey don't get the wrong idea, he made me do it.  this cave is floating in salt. of course it is, and i'm slugwart, the salt mater. what i say goes. hen say that you'll help us. our town is in desperate need of salt. too bad. i'm in desperate need of worker, and you two will begin immediately. the rules here are simple &nbsp.one ten minute break a day, one meal a day, and no talking.  allstar: this is where all the salt in the sea comes from. quiet. less talking and more work, or else. we're way behind schedule. behind. but why. less questions, more work. excuse me, but wouldn't the workers make more salt if you took away their ten minute break. cork your snork. yeah, junior. things look bad enough down here as it is. what a clever snork. what did you say your name was. uh, wetworth junior wetworth. why that little sneak. alright, you. start working. forget it, fat face. i've got peopel at home counting on me. *tries escaping* you'll never make it, little one. what are you talking about. they don't look so tough. *guards blow him away* as i was saying, looks can be deceiving. ou see, no one can stand up to those bullhorns, little one. have to do something before things get too bad at home. <transition>  so you say there are more like you. more snorks. huh. oh yeah. there's a whole town full of snorks. a whole town. are they, good workers. they're as good as those two neandersnorks over there. which two. snatches more salt behind his back* to megasnork* i've got to get out of here. they need my help back home. you'll never escape from here. what is it with you guys. have you all just given up, lost all hope. yep. i don't believe it. if we all stand up for what is right, we can make a change for the better.&nbsp. ay who. e. come on.  no one's gonna push us around anymore, right. uh huh. uh huh. we can make a difference, if we just jet forward. uh huh. uh huh. so let's go. nah uh. nah uh. now listen. there are dozens and dozens of us, and only three of them. aughty naughty, allstar. slugwart's going to be mad. oh, am i mad. *allstar's now on wheel* so mad that this snork with the big mouth will stay right in here forever. with that nosey allstar out of the way, i can get down to some serious salt stealing. *laughs* and no more breakfast till we're back on schedule. ou call this breakfast.. allstar was right, you treat us like algae. exhausted from running* that's the, uh, spirit, megasnork. *sees him puring salt all over the guards* see. one snork can make a difference, especially when he's huge.  huffer. wolfer. what happened. stop, boys. show those neandersnorks who's boss. runs* show 'em yourself. there's too many of 'em. runs too* hey, wait for me. you snorks can't lick an old saltmaster like me so easily. you haven't seen the last of *runs into kelp* slugwart.  eally. i can explain everything. opens back door to reveal all the salt that's been stashed this whole time* there's tons of salt in here. you snorks were never behind schedule at all. slugwart was jsut hoarding it all for himself. is greed was causing a salt shortage everywhere, *to junior* and you were helping. t, but i can explain everything. see, i was acting as a spy for allstar, and, uh, i was bringing this salt out, to prove to you, uh, that slugwart was hiding. oh cork up your snork. i think you should stay and work the wheel for a while. and try grinding the salt, instead of stealing it. crying to allstar on his knees* allstar, please. don't let them keep me. you have to take me back with you. *cries some more* got any good reasons why. yes. i'm allergic to work. it's such a grind. *cries even more* oh, help. alright, but on one condition. kisses his foot* anything. *kisses it again* anything.  we'll have the salt level back to normal immediately, thanks to you, allstar. you'll always be welcome here. gee, thanks. but you guys did all the hard work. *to junior* and we're saving you a place on the wheel, if you don't get your sneaky snork out of here. uh, thanks, but don't bother, i'm leaving. *all say goodbye* now what's this one condition. you'll see.  ugh. next. ighty nice of you to hand out all this salt at your expense, junior. hmm, i'm surprised at you. eah, so am i. it's embarrassing for a wetworth to give anything away. ugh. next. hanks, junior. having fun. *obvious sarcasm* oh, you bet. having the time of my life, sure. eh, next.  here's the salt, dad. *smells chilli* oh boy, i'm starved. uh allstar, i know my chilli has to simmer a while, but you've been gone five days. sorry, dad. here, mom. what kept ya, son. *places salt in chilli and stirs it* you mean who kept me. it's a long story. *tastes it and is hot* and, i'll have to tell you about it later. *opours a bucket of water over his head* ah.   )
