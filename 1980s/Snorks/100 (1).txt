 stop the music. i can't stand this awful noise any longer. the big school dance is tomorrow night what are we gonna do. oh, if only we had a new sound.  like that beautiful tooting. where's it coming from.  t's another tooting snork. *immediately enamoured by her* hi, my name is allstar, what's your's. : tadah. : she must be the new exchanged student from the south sea town of snork fort. : *heart pops out of his snork and he hides behind snip and snap* : don't be shy, tooter, go over and say "hello." *tries to, but tubah enters and knocks him over* : my name's tubah, city snorker, and tadah's my gal. heart still pops out of his snork* etter cut that out, or i'm gonna blow you out of the water with my super sonic snork. *totos "oh yeah.."* yeah. *blos him away with it* here, tadah, you can carry my books to class. that tubah's a real bully. but you won't give up without a fight, right tooter. sighs in agreement*  angrily stomps up and down* oh, you may not have a super sonic snork, tooter, but there are other ways to impress tadah. yeah. i'll show ya how to build a sandcastle. she'll forget all about tubah when she sees it.  t's in cares what sure is a home dinger. i wonder who commenced to build it. *pops uo with a heart flag and says he built it for tadah* blows it down with his sonic snork* they just don't make sandcastles like they used to. *laughs as tooter waves the flag*  stop the music. tadah's tooting helps, but we still don't have the right sound. *groan* not junior. *gives tadah a flower* *blows him away* when are you gonna learn to stay away from my gal. : you think you're so tough. but i bet you can't beat tooter in an obstale course race without using your super sonic snork. : you're on, shrimpboat. : if tooter wins, he gets to take tadah to the big dance.&nbsp. : i'll say yes, cause he doesn't stand a chance. *laughs and walks away* <transition>  our champion is ready for action.&nbsp. : tooter will knock the socks off that icky twotime tubah. did someone call my name.. : yikes. it's tubah. i better get to my judges table quick. *goes up top* the obstacle course is at the bottom of this tidal pool. whoever reaches junior's tower first is the winner. on your mark, get set, *casey blows conk* go.  i'm stuck. i promised to not use my sonic snork, but what the judge don't see won't hurt him. *laughs and blows his sonic snork to trap tooter into some sea eneminies* so long sucker. imma gonna sonic snork my way to victory. *trapped, but gets out a photo of tadah and then catches up to tubah, noe being ahead of the race* *watching from above* tubah and tooter are heading into the home stretch.&nbsp. *uses his sonic snork to trap tooter once again* see ya at the finish line, loser. *laughs*&nbsp. : tubah's cheating. i better tell the others. *pops out of the tidal pool* i won me a race fair and square. i've got something to say about that. about whta, good buddy. *gulps* have a nice time with tadah at the dance. *angry at tubah*&nbsp. : oh don't be a sore loser, tooter. i'm the judge, and i declare tubah the winner. : *sticks his tongue out at him*&nbsp. : get him out of here, allstar, before i toss him out of our band too. : let's go visit gallio. maybe he can help you with tadah.  *moans* ah yes, romance. sometimes it's not a pretty sight. *tooter agrees with him* fortunately, i may have something that'll help you win tadah. *gets out an invention of his* i call my little invention, "the tootah blaser." wear it, and your tooting will be magnified a thousand times. *places it on tooter, and it literally blows down the house* wow. finally, tooter's gonna beat tubah at his own game.  pick me a whole mess of flowers, tadah. i want everyone to know you're my dancin' date. we'll see about that. haven't i already told you about stickin' your snorks into my business.. *tries to stop him* no use stickin' up for tooter, tadah. he's gonna get plastered. *blows him into the flowers* that'll earn ya. *blasts tubah with the tootah blaster, then offers tadah a flower, which she refuses* what's the matter, tadah. tooter's finally outblasted that mean old tubah. : *rants about it* *translating* tubah always bullied snorks to get what he wanted. *she rants some more* now tooter's acting the same way. so you're leaving with tubah. leafves indefinitely*  isn't there anything we can do to help cheer you up, tooter. *shakes his head* well now that that big lummux tubah is history, i might as well confess.&nbsp. what are you talking about, junior. tubah really did use his sonic snork to win the race. i saw the whole thing. i just had to keep my mouth shut, or he would've sonic snorked me into the sand. *all get angry and throw him out into the trash can* well, that's gratitude for ya. come on, gang. let's go find tadah and tell her the truth. *gets so excited, the tootah blaster blasts the entire bland room*  well we've looked everywhere today. tadah seems to have vanished.&nbsp. let's pick up this search later. i need a beauty nap. *all stop as they hear what sounds like a creature making creepy swallowing and chewing noises with his mouth* who's making that mondo grossout icky sound. i don't wanna know.&nbsp. points out that tadah and tubah are about to be eaten by a giant clam* shiverin' snorks. it's a clam cruncher. *he and tadah huddle together while the clam licks them then swallows tadah* yuck, yuck, that tickles. let go of my gal, clam breath. *he spits tubah out* quick, tubah. use your super sonic snork to save tadah. well slap me with a tuna, why didn't i thunk of that.. i'm gonna blast you into clam chowder, you rotten cruncher. *but the clam blasts him into the wall* i'm sonic snorked out. what are we gonna do.. *marches over to help out* wait a minute tooter's gona a plan. *plays a musical melody with the tootah blaster, and the clam cruncher follows along with it* it's working. tooter's communicating with the clam cruncher. *still singing, until clam cruncher pops out tadah, where they hug and he takes off his tootah blaster* tooter, i got one thing to tell you. i'm as sorry as a flounder in a fish school for acting like i did. you saved tadah. if she wants to go to that snorkin' high school hootinany with you, it's alright with me. hooray.  w, tooter sure is happy with tadah. *her and allstar look at each other and smile* and i sure am happy with our hot new sound. tubah's sonic snork is just what our band needed. thanks, good buddy. i'm always happy to help out at a hoedown. *blasts junior off the stage and everyone laughs in response while tooter and tadah continue dancing*   )
