silliness. *gets out book* it says here that snorkymania wears off in a few hours. ut where does the red stuff come from. that, i don't know. why don't we go out in the silverfish, and find out.

fall into the silverfish* so, escaping the city in the stupid ship of your's, eh.. honestly, junior, you could at least say "thank you." *after occy licks him* we're getting something on the sonar. yeah, i thik we found where the red stuff's coming from it's somewhere north of here, near the grear reef. hey, wait a minute. that's that's beyond the limits. i wanna go home. t's too late now, wetworth.&nbsp.  look at all that stuff. ccording to the sonar, we must be right over the source of the red stuff. *toots a suggestion for them* tooter says we're almost right over the source itself.&nbsp. the source. that's where all of snorkland's power comes from.&nbsp. finds it* look. the red stuff's coming from that thing. but what is it.  what hit me. *occy still kisses him* what happened. *sees it* it's that big can. it's weight is making the ridge crumble. if that can drops into the source, that red stufff will poison our steam, and we'll all have snorkymania forever. *gets out with a rope* we can't let that happen, casey. follow me. *they all follow him. hey, don't leave me alone in there with that maniac mutt. *occy follows him out*&nbsp. we'll attach this line to the can and tow it away. just watch out for that red stuff. *after occy grabs him* hey, snork it off. look out. *red stuff hits him and he starts laughing too*&nbsp. *ties it around can* this'll be a piece of cake.&nbsp. : *he and occy riding the waves* : uh oh, it's junior. he's got snorkymania. : you all finish this. i'll go get junior. : occy, old buddy, this is the life. hey junior, wait up.&nbsp. uh oh, here comes that spoiled sport, allstar. *laughs* hey let's run for it. junior, stop, you're headed for the source. okay, pull. *her and tooter budge* that's it. now, let's get back in the silverfish, and tow it away. *ridge crumbles* huh. *toots an uh oh* this ship is being pulled down into the source. *inside silverfish* quick, we've got to get back into it, i think it's too late. oh, the thing is too heavy. look, occy, no hands. *laughs* *grabs them* hold still, junior. *they all get sucked into the current* : hey you know, you're really a snorky guy, allstar. *laughs* : oh no, the current's too strong. *after dropping the red can* tooter, we did it. *cheers*  oh, thanks for the rescue, guys. don't mention it. once we got the ship under control, we knew we had to find you fast. *sees something* hey. somebody closed the hatch. we're cut off from the control room. steering it* occy, old bud, now all that red stuff will be mine. *laughs* it'll make me the best
