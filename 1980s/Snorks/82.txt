my sandollars, i buy a bone to calm down the dogfish, save the catfish, and make a $4 profit on top of it all. *laughs* does that answer your question, smartypants.&nbsp. oh my goodness, never in all my years have i seen such selfishness. miles* why thank you. that does it. i didn't want to, but it looks like i have no choice. i'm forced to use the polite booth.&nbsp.  you give me 100 clams if i
