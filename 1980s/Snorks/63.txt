i've captured snorkland, and i'll throw every last one of thsoe slimy creatures into the sea salt mines. *slams hand on table* ouch.&nbsp. oh, right. uh, you need a bandage, boss. <transition>  put that sand bag there. *does so* no, not there, there. *two snorks bump into each other* hey you, you go that way. you, go in the line. you, go over there. you, no, there. oh. some snorks can't follow a simple direction in the crisis. *takes out telescope* hey, what's our tactical position. ooh. my goodness.  giddyup. i'll have those snorks in my power soon. *laughs*&nbsp. h my, oh my, where is that corky. ell i think he was seen going into gallio's lab. shall i check, sir. yes. and whatever he's doing, tell him to wrap it up and get over here. oh, i don't like the looks of that can on bigweed's

direction is, don't allow any snork to *cabinet nearly falls on him when speeder stops it* don't allow snorks to get hurt. allstar: bigweed's at the border, and he's getting ready to use some *startled by speeder* strange machine he's brought. but, this could be the end of snorkland. speeder, bigweed and his evil forces want to hurt snorks. we must stop them. you go to the left, i'll go to the right. now don't worry if you don't catch bad guys today. this is very difficult work, and it's only your first time out. will not worry. ood. welcome to  orn* the snork patrol.&nbsp. aughs*

speeder passes him by* phew, that was some current.&nbsp. *helps kid out of tangled kelp* please be more careful when you are around tangled kelp, young snorks. h, we will, speeder. h, very good, speeder. *watches children playing* it's always good to see children so eager to learn. *but then a giant shark comes near them* this is a job for *horn, but speeder locks him up in a cage* there you are, school snorks. please be more careful when you are outdoors. it is a jungle out here. h, we will, speeder. gee, that was a job for *horn* speeder. kids: yay, speeder. hooray for speeder.  well, i hadn't stopped a crime in weeks. oh, or helped a snork in need. oh, or even helped a pet. oh. *leaves* corky. oh, corky.&nbsp. gasps and smiles* finally, someone does need my assistance. i knew i could help someone.&nbsp. ay corky... es, governor, how may i help you. do you know where i can find speeder. oh. gee, no, i   peeder, speeder, speeder. oh, there he is now. nevermind, eh, uh, corky. well, i can see when i'm not needed.&nbsp.  ooks at photo* here i am helping my friends after the seaquake. oh. *sees another ribbon* oh yes, i got this metal for scaring off that nasty family of snorkeaters. oh. and here's my award for best kelpberry pie at the snork county fair. oh, those were the good old days when my friends needed me. now, i guess i'll have to find some new friends in a new town that, really needs me. *his suitcase opens up and everything falls out* oh. *he picks everything back up and places it on his sub with the rest of his things* all my earthly posessions. *sighs* i might as well get going. *but all his stuff falls behind*  sees the sub* hey, i wodner where corky's going with all his stuff. i'll be back in a minute, casey. *follows him* where are you goin', corky. did you get a distress code. haven't had a distress code in weeks. there's the problem. but i'll find a place where someone needs me.&nbsp. well that almost sounds like you're leaving. es, i am. thanks to speeder, you're well protected here. you, *gulps* no longer need me.&nbsp. oh come on, corky, we'll always need you. no one can replace you. : speeder. speeder. speeder. no, no, i'm sure speeder will do a fine job filling my place here. i must go some place where i'm truly needed. goodbye, allstar. *leaves* gee, goodbye, corky my friend. i'm sure i will be welcomed in some community where there is need for assistance. *reads a note from the townsfolk, saying they love him* yes, i'm sure i will be welcomed with open arms. *stops to see a giant squid batting away some fish* i can help these poor, defenseless creatures. hols on, little friends. pardon me, but i believe i can be of assistance here. *the fish opens its mouth and large teeth are revealed* then again, maybe not. *heads back into his sub* this may not be as easy as i thought. {commercial break}  did you read about that speeder. he stopped the rampaignin' taxicrab, rescued a whole school from a tidlewave, and untangled the kids from a kelpfish and the cotton of trees.&nbsp. yeah, but i hear corky's not around anymore.&nbsp. well, with speeder, who really needs corky.&nbsp. yeah, i guess you're right. *shows up and stops the hammer* there is one chance in 327 that you will strike your partner with the hammerhead. i cannot allow snorks to be hurt. *ties them up* i will put both of you in jail for your own safety.&nbsp. let go. hey, what are you doin.. let me go. get me out of here. : well i was gettin' a headache anyway. *laughs and goes on his break*&nbsp.  wee. wee. ou wanna go again. wee, yeah. *she slides down again* wee. *but speeder grabs her* huh.. there is one chance in 2,817 that you will drop the child. i must protect snorks. you will be safer in jail. *grabs him* ail.. oh, but speeder, that's ridiculous. i think whoa.  and now, it won't seem to hurt us, help included. but we must raised taxes.&nbsp. *grabs governor* snorks must not be hurt. i will keep you safe in jail. &nbsp.speeder, this is outrageous. put me down.&nbsp.  making a drink in his lab* a healthy kelp shake for lunch will do nicely. there's one chance in 17,892,602 that you will get a shock from the electric blender. i must rpotect. *grabs him* i must protect. *pacing around outside of town* snorkland does not appear to need me. but as i also said, those snorks are my friends. but speeder has certianly captured their appreciation. but still, they may need me. but, speeder is quite effective. but i think i left my toothbrush at the snork patrol headquarters. i better go get it. yes, it is important that i return. ees snorks going to jail* speeder has really gone bananafish. there must be a way to stop him. huh. oh, thank goodness corky's come back. *sees occy* occy too.. that does it. i've got to get corky to stop this. i guess the coast is clear. *kncoks on door* come on, corky.&nbsp. here is one chance in 93 million  yao... *jumps high*&nbsp. &nbsp.709,602.4 that you could hurt your hand hitting that solid surface. i will put you in jail where it is safe.&nbsp. : no, wait. i've gotta warn corky. i've gotta *takes him away* opens door* that's strange. i thought i heard someone knock. no, that's not possible. everyone's probably at another party for speeder. hmm, that's odd. maybe i need to find otu just where everyone is. i can't find a soul, or a hammock, or even a flounder. hi, everybody. *realizes they're in jail* great seasnork's ghost. i can't believe my eyes. i can't believe it. all my friends are criminals. we're not criminals, corky. speeder thinks he's keeping us from harm by locking us up. es. speeder is overprotecting the town. mm, can these criminals be telling the truth. your devotion to justice is admirable, my boy. but, get us out of here... ake it easy, sir, corky will set things straight. of course, corky, sorry. i just usually don't spend time in jail. corky, we're your friends, we aren't criminals. we wouldn't lie to you. we really need you. you're right. you would not lie to a friend, would you. no. of course not. i didn't think so. but what can i do. speeder is my creation gallio and i made him the perfect crime fighter. how can i, a mere snork, stop him. you're a hero, corky, you can do it. i know you will think of a plan. we're counting on you, son. yes, i must uphold the honor of *horn* the snork patrol. somehow...  here goes nothing. *mops the floor and says "la la"* there is one chance in eight zillion, 932 million &nbsp.  whew.  hey, what's that. what's what. i don't *bang* oh, that.&nbsp. 321, that you might get a sliver while sweeping. i must protect you.&nbsp. take me away, speeder. *taken in jail* t was a good try, corky.&nbsp. yes, you got the box very clean before i had to protect you. should've known i couldn't beat speeder. oh, i'm jut not good enough. don't be so hard on yourself. you did your best. your plan was brilliant. we just did too good a job building speeder. yes, i protect snorks very well. yes, too well. i thought we built the perfect servant. but you're doing more harm than good.&nbsp. what do you mean, harm. know you meant well, speeder. but, but it hurts snorks to be locked up. *gasps* these snorks are hurt. i must protect them. i will let them out. but if i let them out, they will not be safe. but if i put snorks in jail, then they will be safe but it hurts them. i must not let all snorks to be hurt. protection causes hurt. *short circuits and twitches* protect, hurt. protect, hurt. does not compute, does not compute. *falls apart* cheer* way to go, corky.  and so i give you the one, the only, the irreplaceable corky. heer* hooray for corky. hank you, governor wetworth, and all my friends.&nbsp. and gallio and i whipped up a little surprise to show our appreciation, corky. oh no, that's not  it is ta dah.  t's speeder. no need to worry. gallio has turned a statue of speeder into you. oh. *in awe*&nbsp. oh, thank goodness. the only place he'll be going is in the snorkland park. *laughs*&nbsp. hat a relief. now i can really get some rest. ooray for corky. hooray. horray.   )
