 as you know, most of the snork food comes from the kelp beds out there. now over there are the kelp planking machines.&nbsp. mmm, i'll take two kelpburgers smothered in mustard clams.&nbsp. *laugh at him* oh dimmy, you're a crack up. save the jokes till later, please. uh, ms. seabottom, is it true that snorks need kelp to survive. oh, i'm glad you asked that question, master wetworth. oh, leave it to junior to polish to old aboloney. *laughs* baloney is right. without kelp, we snorks would starve actually. and we nearly did, during the great famine of long ago. the great famine.. what happened. housands of hummerfish invaded our kelpbeds in a great sworm, filling the water with their humming sounds. *as all this goes on, a factory worker sprays a fish away from the kelp* then the music stopped, as the hummers began to eat, and within minutes, they had eaten every last stalk of kelp.&nbsp. hat's awful. ummers are friendly creatures, but unfortunately for us, however, a single hummer no bigger than a mino can eat enough kelp for a week to feed a snork for a year. speaking of eating, ms. seabottom, what time is lunch. lunch is when i say "lunch," or when the factory whistle blows.  whistles loudly, and everyone scrams out of there as fast as they can*&nbsp. no, wait, come back here.  that was some story ms. seabottom told about the hummerfish. uh huh. let's hope they never ever come back. hums to himself as he finds an empty spot to picnic he then sees a purple fish with a red market caught ina sea eneminie, so he saves it they both create unique humming sounds together*&nbsp. *he and daffney pass him by* come on, tooter. you know how ms. seabottom is about being late. *says goodbye to it, but it follows him he stil tries getting it to go back home, but it sneaks inside his basket instead unknowingly, tooter picks up his basket and flower*  *the fish pops out of the basket and kisses tooter on the cheek* *sees all this and snickers* ms. seabottom says no humming on the bus, and what's that. *hides the fish* ms. seabottom, tooter has a fish on the bus. tooter has a fish on the bus. oh junior, don't be such a snitch.&nbsp.  b flat. oh, dear. i'm afraid that's the right note. *measures it* and, it certainly is the right size. what are you trying to tell us, uncle gallio. i have bad news, my young friend. this is a hummerfish. : *shocked* : are you absolutely sure, uncle gallio. indeed and this highly unusual marking tells us that this particular specimen is the head hummer the hummer that guides the fish to the new feeding grounds. : uh oh. : that is bad news. : *takes out a scroll and reads a section* and i think you all should know that ever since the great kelp famine, that snork law has demanded that all hummers have to be killed on site.&nbsp. killed...... *helps tooter place it back in the basket*&nbsp. *he and occy leave* tooter, wait, tooter...  *he and occy make humming sounds, but the fish refuses to leave* cruising around in his steam convertable* what's that strange humming noise. if that's what i think it is *gets out*&nbsp. *still tries getting it to leave when junior shows up* tooter, that's a hummerfish. don't let him get away. *tries grabbing it but fails*&nbsp. *growls at him* wait, my father says all hummers must be destroyed.  *chases them* tooter, give me that fish. i said give it to me. nks him in response* oh no. i'm gonna tell my father. attempts to actually set it free* oh, he got it, ooh, i jsut wanna take him, and, ooh. <transition>  and then he says he let the fish go. out by the kelpbeds.. we were gonna take him to the council, but  you listen to me, tooter. you knew, they knew, and dr. gallio knew that the fish in question was a hummer. oh, what you did was wrong, son. wrong.  governor, i'm sure that my son didn't understand the seriousness of the situation.&nbsp. i don't think any of you understand how dangerous that fish really is.&nbsp.  after so many "hups"* attention, ho.&nbsp. men, i need not remind you of the seriosity of this situation. now i want you to cover every square inch of snorkland, and destroy every hummer you find. orward, snork. *as they march, more hummers eat the kelp)  olding musical tuner* i tell you, my boy, that hummerfish is still out there, and he can't be far away. the trouble is, he's not alone. hummerfish are popping up all over snorkland. if this keeps up, we'll be facing another famine.&nbsp. isn't there any way we can stop them, uncle gallio. ot that i know of. realizes* what is we took the submarine, and looked for that head hummer. great idea, allstar. thinks for a moment* i don't know. the odds are against even findng that fish again.  hat are you going to do about the hummerfish, governor. does the governor have a plan. how long will our food supplies last. governor, how are ya gonna stop the hummers. well, we have a plan. *then gets flashed by the camera's lenses*  here they are thousands of them. h, let's hope they don't eat the submarine. notices something* you hear 'em. es, he does* okay, tooter, do your stuff.&nbsp. *hums loudly, which gets them to follow the silverfish* oh allstar, what a heavenly sound.&nbsp. t's really beautiful. keep it up, tooter. he's right behind us. *does so*&nbsp. now that we've got them, where can we take them. there's only one place where we can take them beyond the limits. beyond the limits.. thinks that might be a problem*  wow, we've never been this far before. you're right and we better find a kelp bed soon or we'll never get back. *worn out and can't hum any longer* i know you're exhausted, tooter, but you've got to keep tooting. *hiccupping slightly* ooter, what's wrong. *the humming stops, and so they leave* oh allstar, the hummers we're losing them. they're heading back towards snorkland. and that's not all look at that mosnter coming at us.  ooter. everybody, hang on. closes his eyes until the fish is caught between two coral rocks* now, let's gather up our stray hummers, and find them a kelp pasture. : *hums, and the hummers follow the silverfish to an empty and wide kelp field* : oh, that's enough kelp to keep them busy for a hundred years. *says goodbye to the head hummer, and soon the others head out into the field*  and so, fellow snorks, we celebrate the end of the hummer invasion, and the dawn od a bright new day for snorkland. i promised you that my administration would meet this threat, and we did. now, everybody dance. oh boy, the governor made it sound like he got rid of the hummers. i don't remember seeing him beyond the limits, do you. well casey, governors will be governors. wanna dance. d love to. *skips over to tooter*&nbsp. asks her* : of course, you. *they both dance together*&nbsp.   )
