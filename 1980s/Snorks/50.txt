no fair, double dribble. keep going, you're doing great. game point, wetworth. oh, yeah. *trips him* *catches allstar, snatches to ball from junior, and throws it into the hoop* hooray for occy. *as occy licks him* that's my occy. *mocking* that's my occy, that's my occy. *then the two growl at each other*  oh, it's a cawagdengil, howdiloon. *toots a cheer for it* *steps out of the limo* excuse me. would you be so kind as to tell me where i might find a certain octopuppy. i believe they call him "occy." uh, well, his name is occy. oh, might i inspect this handsome creature.&nbsp. *growls at him* occy, behave yourself. uh, sure, go ahead. there, there, why, i won't hurt you. *finds a star on his head* it's jewelry. *bows to him* we've been looking for you for such a long time. you're grace. his name is occy, not grace. yeah, what's this all about. oh sorry, i must seem quite forward. may i present little lord occy. *mouths drop in surprise* *laughs* that's crazy. silence, young wippersnork. this pup bears the birthmark of the snorks of eelhampton. *gasps* they're worth 12 billion clams. occy is the long lost octopuppy of lord snorkington. but, but he's mine. i apprue that you let me take occy. you'll make an old snork very happy, and lord occy will ascend to his rigthful throne in high society. thorne. did i hear, throne. no way, jose. occy belongs to allstar. yeah.&nbsp. oh, what a pity. his lordship would make a sizeable donation for master occy's return, and wouldn't be lovely to see a deluxe new playground built here. just think of how everyone would enjoy it. *leaves in limo* i'll be at the picaroo plaza if you change your mind. boy, the nerve of that guy. what a slimeylimey fish. *honks at him* yikes, we gotta get home. *to occy* come on, boy, i'll race ya. yeah, it's getting late. hey, guys, don't rush off yet. i've got an idea.  later that night) now let me get this straight. you want me to give occy to lord snorkington. you can't deny his destiny, or our good fortune. just think he'll live like a king in that fantabulous snorkington manner. yeah, and he'll go to an exclusive obedient school. but, but &nbsp. allstar seaworthy, how can you be so shellfish. get her. *blushes* well, heh... you know what i mean.&nbsp. but i don't wanna give up occy. we know you don't, but you gotta think of the big picture.&nbsp. snorktown needs a new playground. it's going to be superdeluxe seascrumptious, i can hardly wait. *toots in agreement* i see what you mean. but, well occy will never go for it. that's simple just pretend you don't like him. i can't do that, occy's my pal. sure you can. go ahead, try.  okay, uh... occy, i don't like you anymore. you're, uh, a silly little octopup. i'm, i'm, uh, tired of playing with you, and i've, i've i wish you'd go away.  see. it's easy as snorkberry pie. gee, i don't know.  would you like a ride, my lord. *occy gets in* so good to have you aboard, master occy.  there, there, master occy, there's nothing to be frightened of.  by gove, hobbs, you've done it. master occy, may i present to you lord snorkington. prince of whales, earl of eelhampton, barron of bashire, and master of snorkington manor. my, my, i say, what a bolly creature. *growls at him* why you impertinent pup. i say, hobbs, don't be too hard on him. the excitement of the trip may have been too much. i'm afraid master occy hasn't received much training in the social graces. oh dear, well we can't have that. of course not, sir. that's why i've seen to it that occy's formal education begin today. *shakes at this* <transition>  the first thing we've got to do is to spiff you up a bit. i hope you don't have seafleas.&nbsp. *gets cleaned and with a pink bowtie* ah, that's much better.  *slurps out of it* no, no, no, we must learn proper table etiquette. a soup spoon, salad fork, carving knife, servant spoon, caviar spatula, snd so on and so forth. oh dear, are we behind schedule. come, now, we're off to our afternoon activities.  it goes like this, occy. *hits piano notes while singing high notes*&nbsp. *fails at getting the notes high enough, and hobbs has to cover his ears*  i say, hobbs, you've doen a smashing job. occy will be the sensation of the snorkutante ball. that is nothing, sir. there is just one problem, sir. problem. what problem. our little lord has lost his appetite. i'm afraid he misses his friends.&nbsp. well let's invite them to the ball. that'll cheer him up. very good, sir. i've already sent the invitation.  i still think they should've named it after me it was my idea.&nbsp. *swims away, quite depressed* cheer up, allstar, i'm sure occy's fine. *toots in agreement* well, you're probably right. i ju, i just wish i knew for sure. *with letter* whoa, hold on to your snorks, gang. guess what i jsut got in the mail. did you win the sea snork sweepstakes. no, it's even better. we're all invited to the snorkutante ball. oh, i'll get to hot knob in high society.&nbsp. i'll get to wear a new gown. and i'll get to see occy. &nbsp.  *gasps* this is incredible. i'll say. get a load of these gardens. *toots in excitement* somebody pinch me, i msut be dreaming. *scratching himself* please, master occy, you're a gentleman now. you wouldn't want your friends to be ashamed of your behavior, would you. *shakes his head* *get out of limo and are in awe at everything* welcome to snorkington manor. it's so good of you to come. *shakes hands with him* anytime this is the lifestyle i was born to live. yes, would you like to see your rooms. *tries to guide them* no, no, master occy, that's my job.  come on, let's dance. do the snork shuffle, occy. *dances with her, but hobbs snatches him away* wee, swing your partners. *grabs occy, but hobbs makes him sit on a yellow throne* poor occy, he doesn't get to have any fun. boy, is he snooty. he's ignored us the whole time we've been here. what's the problem. he's rich now, he's suppsoed to be that way. don't feel sad, allstar, you can get another octopup. i'll hear of no such thing. now don't excite yourself, sir. don't baby me, hobbs. a snork and his pup belong together. i was a foolish old snork to think otherwise. it's alright, little occy, go to allstar. *bounces over to allstar and licks him* whoa boy, settle down. all the riches in the world can't replace the loss of a friendship. but, but what about the new playground. it shall be completed as planned. i never break a promise.  *laughs* i say, when you take occy home, would you take his seafleas with him. hobbs won't mind, even though he's gotten very attached to them. *laugh*   )
