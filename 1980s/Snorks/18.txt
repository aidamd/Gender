 oh, this reef has lots of plants for our aquabotany class, dimmy. *spots a red coral piece* what's that. *sees it moves* yipe, it's moving. *looks at it* amazing. it seems to be some sort of coral cocoon.&nbsp. yuck. don't touch it, casey. who knows where it's been.&nbsp. oh, don't be such a scaredy snork. *two creatures pop out* yipe. *her and dimmy hide*  papapaplease don't hurt us. don't be afraid. we're friendly. well in that case, nice to meet you. the name's dimmy. *shakes hands with them* and this is casey kelp.&nbsp. i'm red. and i'm ed. and together, we're a complex &nbsp. duplex. *yawns* and we've been hibernating  &nbsp.long, long time and i, i mean, we're hungry. oh sensational. we'll have lunch together. let's jet along. *they follow her*&nbsp.  four quarter flounders coming right up. and thanks for eating at snorkinthebox. *pops out basket, and casey gives it some change* mmm, that sure looks tasty. i'll say. mind if i have some. sure, help yourself. *eats the whole basket* where are your manners, and what about my diet. well, i wasn't that hungry anyway.&nbsp. oh look, there are some friends of ours. come on, i'll introduce you. *takes them to allstar and tooter* allstar, tooter, wait up.&nbsp. great groupers, casey, what kind of seaplant is that. *giggles* it's no seaplant, silly, it's a complex duplex named red and ed.&nbsp. hey. hi. *to tooter* keep your eye on that kelpsickle. that red head loves to eat. *red swallows it* see what i mean. *toots in disappointment* please excuse my brother's indescriminate overeating. *moans and rubs stomach* it seems to have given me a bellyache. *rubs his as well* oh, me too. don't worry. my uncle gallio will have something for your indigestion. *takes them to him* come on.&nbsp.  this aquaseltzer should settle your stomach.&nbsp. *drink* ah, thanks doc. we needed that.&nbsp. what's this.&nbsp. *shows sizemograph to them* this is my latest invention the super sea sizemograph. it's so sensitive, it can trace the sound of a falling shell. *demonstates it by dropping the shell, and it works*&nbsp. *yawns* forgive me, i must be boring you. it's not you, dr. gallio. it's red's turn to sleep. *red snores* a complex aquarius sleep patterns allow one head to rest while the other stays awake. fascinating. well it may be fascinating to you, but it can be a real drag. *leaves* come on, you can stay at my house.  of course, you two can sleep in the living room.&nbsp. casey: yes. this is a convertable conk. *pops out bed* mrs. kelp: i'll leave some of my special searoses by your bed. *puts them out* ed: *smells them* they're beautiful. i raise them in my garden. and they're going to tkae first prize at next week's snorkland's seaflower show.&nbsp. oh, daff, you're such an optimist. here's a pillow. *places it behind them* good night, ed.&nbsp. good night. *yawns then falls asleep* *smiles then smirks* at last, he's asleep, the only time i ever have any fun. *laughs* now what's to eat around here. *sees searoses* ah, these smell yummy. *eats them* they taste even better. *eats some more* i could eat a reef full of these. *sees garden* this must be my lucky night. *eats again* uh oh, i did bad, but it felt so good. now to have some more fun.  *places bubbles in the lab* now this is fun. *sizemograph goes crazy* lucky for me, he's such a sound sleeper. *laughs* now to make that thing really move. *pops bubbles* pop go the bubbles. *registers high and jumps up and down* oh, this should really register. and this. *knocks over book shelf, and it explodes* whoo, that was quite a quake. oh, that party pooper's gonna wake up soon, i better get back. *leaves*&nbsp. <transition>  *opens window* rise and float, everybody, it's a beautiful *gasp*. my searoses, they're gone. jumping jellyfish, what in the whirlpool could've happened. you were awake during the night. did you see anything.&nbsp. yes, red, did you. yes, well, uh, as a matter of fact, i did feel a cold wave pass by. is there anythign we can do. cold waves happen, it's not your fault. even with my green thumb, i don't think it's possible to grow more searoses in time for the show.&nbsp. oh, poor mom. her searoses were so beautiful.&nbsp. but we've seen wild ones almost as nice.&nbsp. sure, way out on the reef. hey, maybe if we look, we can find some. come on. *they follow her into town* *horns in town* tooter, what's the emergency.  obviosuly, there was a tremendous seaquake during the night.&nbsp. but uncle gallio, none of us felt it.&nbsp. *toots he didn't feel it either* uh, i felt it. it was real strong almost knocked me, or, er, us, out of bed.&nbsp. i knew my sea sizemograph wasn't mistaken. what a strage turn of events. first a cold wave ruins my mom's searoses, a now a crazy crazy quake wrecks your uncle's lab.&nbsp. casey, where in the whirlpool are you going. *leaves with red and ed* out to the reef to find my mom some wild searoses, i hope.&nbsp. *finds a pedal from a searose* looks like tooter found a searose of his own. *smells it through his snork* i know that scent anywhere. that's one of casey's mom's homegrown searoses. but how did it get into the lab.&nbsp. maybe it blew in last night, except these shell shutters are closed. *finds red and yellow hairs* this hair got stuck in them.&nbsp. *sees it* yeah, red and yellow, like that complex duplex, and one's used a crowbarfish on my shutters. very peculiar.&nbsp. i'll say. *star turns on his belt* the duplex was never near the window yesterday, so their hair means they snuck in last night, wrecked your lab, and dropped a searose while they were at it. *toots why*&nbsp. i don't know why, tooter, but something tells me casey's new friends are bad news. *heads out*  just be careful.  oh, not a searose in sight. and we can't go much further. there are dangerous reef rapids all along here.&nbsp. i'm sorry, casey. the searose beds must have shifted since the last time we hibernated.&nbsp. yeah, it doesn't look like a very good spot for lunch, either.&nbsp. red, you're starting to worry me. sometimes all you think about is your *yawns* stomach. our stomach, brother, and it looks like it's time for your nap. *he yawns*&nbsp. heads up, you two, i found them. *pulls them out* oh, just look at these wild searoses, they're beautiful.&nbsp. *yawns* i'm so glad, casey. *falls asleep* so am i. *eats them* tasty. not tasty as your mom's, but not bad. you ate my mom's searoses. sure, while he was asleep. *slowly goes after her* and now, i'm gonna eat you.&nbsp. but i'm a snork. you don't eat snorks, do you. *laughs* why not try. what do i have to lose. *wakes up* a friend, that's what. ed, what are you doing up. i said you were starting to worry me, red. yeah, but you're supposed to be asleep. well i only closed my eyes so i could see what you're up to. well i'm having snork for lunch, and don't try to stop me. i'm stronger than you are, and i eat more. *nearly falls over the waterfalls* i'm sorry i met you two. help. casey. are you out of your head. come back here. *grabs her* got ya.  now look what you've done. you're stuck.&nbsp. use your head. we're both stuck. hey, you're right.  you're safe now, casey, i saw the whole thing. *shakes their hands* congratulations, red, you're a hero. you too, ed.&nbsp. who. hero. me. iiuh, i mean us.. *cheers for them* but what are you doing here, allstar. oh, i had some silly suspicions about the duplex ruining uncle gallio's lab, adn your mom's garden. *sees them picking out wild searoses* but, i see i was wrong.&nbsp. do you think we have enough for mrs. kelp. if you take anymore, we won't be able to swim.&nbsp. what's going on. red's found out a better way to get attention. okay, i'm coming, i'm coming.&nbsp.  oh red, they're beautiful. uh, i hope you win the contest, mrs. kelp. now where are we going.&nbsp.  thanks for fixing up my lab, red. i like doing good things. it makes me feel good. *yawns* good and tired.&nbsp.  *laughs* oh, this is fun. well, how am i doin', casey. oh, just fine. oh, it's hard to believe ed ever had a bad side to him. yawns* but how am i ever gonna get a good night's sleep. oh, i can't wait to hibernate.    )
