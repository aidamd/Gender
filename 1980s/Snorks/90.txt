last long eough, but i'm getting close. *laughs*&nbsp.  &nbsp.i win. well i would've won this snorkade game if junior hadn't hit my ball out of the court. yeah, and i would've won if junior hadn't cheated and used my ball instead of his. yeah, junior, you should be like your brother. right. willie's never in trouble, but you're always fooling around. me. fooling around.. that's ridiculous. hey, watch this. *hits ball out of there* i'll get it, junior. *follows it into the cave* it's inside, it's inside.&nbsp. i see where it went. i got it.  what's that. *willie's in front of the beam* who's

waiting, willie.&nbsp. i guess causing trouble swims in his family.&nbsp. hey. my little brother hardly does anything wrong. okay, i'm taking my shot now. *hits ball but shadow casues all of them to move around* hat do you think you're doing, willie. i didn't do anything i jsut tapped my ball honest. let us resume play and please, willie, kindly seize the horsing around. i'll continue play from here. *shadow grabs the ball before corky can hit it* dreadfully amusing, willie, now cut it out. but i didn't do it. hey, i can win with one shot, watch. *hits ball but shadow takes the stick eel away and give it to willie, who looks at it blankly* my dear girl. you missed the post cause willie pulled it out. what's gotten into you, willie. *pretends to cry* willie made me lose. but i didn't do it. sure, then what's that post doing in your hand..&nbsp. ... don't think i did it.  run a muck shadow, look at my creation. ruined beyond repair. *frees finneas too* hmm, but if i get the shadow back, i still might rule snorkland. let's go, finneas, i'll need more help.&nbsp. <transition>  oh no, look who's here. uh oh. hi, where'd you guys go. willie, old chum. if you go to the movies with

with willie. &nbsp.so long, willie. goodbye, and good riddance.&nbsp. : *as the others leave him behind* but i oh, what's the use.. *sees his shadow move towards him* it's a ghost. my gosh. it's shaped like me. *they move together* it's not a ghost, it's my shadow i think. *shadow trips him* what kind of a shadow are you. *throws willie up in the air, and he almost gets eaten by a barricuda* boy, i've gotta tell him it wasn't me, that it was my shadow. he and finneas watch nearby* there it is, finneas. get ready. *strangesnork tries to tie it up, but it gets away* grab that blasted shadow, finneas. *they miss and fall into the mud as he mumbles some unclear words* shadow, but we'll get it yet.  ey, wait for me, i have something to tell you. oh no, guess who. you know who did all that stuff that made you mad. it was my shadow. eah, sure willie. his shadow, of course. hmm, willie, why don't you and your shadow both taddle along home. oh, please let me go with you. i'll be a might camper.&nbsp. well, let's say you snorks. alright, willie, but remember, you've made a sacred promise.  okay, everybody, lunch is ready. m starving. me too. hen what are we waiting for. let's

makes you responsible, junior. right. junior should wash pots, too.  splendid, jojo. um, what is it.&nbsp. a tigerfish trap. it'll catch willie redhanded.&nbsp. brilliant, but i don't think you'll need it. we're about to take a vote.&nbsp. okay, somebody better go get willie and junior so they can face their accusors. *corky brings them in* all those in favor of making junior and willie both walk home say i.&nbsp. atches shadow pulling on tent* willie's doing it again.&nbsp. willie, we all see you, now let the tent alone. but, hwo can willie be out tampering with the tent when he's, he's right here. willie is here. i told ya it's my shadow. it is his shadow. bserves it* incredible. absolutely impossible, but, but, there it is.&nbsp. well what'll we do about it.&nbsp. *watching from afar* there's the shadow, and it's about to be under my rule. atol. i just remembered there was a shadow in a story called "peter pan." and they caught it, and roled it up. *rolls it* what did they do with it then, corky. &nbsp.hmm, i can't seem to remember... steps out of hiding* come on, finneas. let's get the shadow before he does remember. *gets trapped upside down in his own trap* gasps* now i got it. you unroll it, and stick it on its owner. *does this for strangesnork* now it's their shadow.&nbsp. hadow, get me down. *does so* success at last. it is my slave shadow. *laughs* and soon, snorkland will be mine. *shadow ties him up in his outfit* whwhwhat are you doing.. are you crazy. finneas, get that shadow away from me. *throws rocks at them* if this is having a slave, then i don't think i really want one. *runs from the rocks*&nbsp. willie, we're all real sorry. yes, willie, we apologize. join me, snorks. *she sings along with them*&nbsp.<i>for he's a jolly good fellow, for
