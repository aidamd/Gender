 i can't wait to show uncle gallio my new science project.&nbsp. *bounces ball behind him* stop, occy, i don't have time to play snorkball with you. *throws it* now swim along home. now to jet away before occy follows.&nbsp. allstar, is that what you've been working on for weeks. yes, it's a high density bubble gun. *toots as occy bounces ball* what's it do. it emits high density bubbles that can carry things many times their weight. watch. *demonstrates with a clam* *toots wow* yeah, that's clamtastic.&nbsp. and the bubbles don't pop they're reusable. *occy throws ball at his head, causing him to drop and break his machine* toots an uh oh* eah, too bad your project wasn't unbreakable.&nbsp. occy, look at what you've done. you ruiend my bubble gun, and now i'll probably fail science class. well, are ya happy.. moans* maybe your uncle gallio will be able to fix it.&nbsp. maybe i should've oicked a nice, gentle jellyfish for a pet. cries and drops ball to go home*   there is some major external damage, allstar, but the bubble generator itself appears to be *bubble in him* in working order.&nbsp. *solemnly* well that's good news, uncle gallio.&nbsp. *clears throat* you don't sound too pleased, allstar. m not too pleased with myself, uncle gallio. i should've never yelled at occy the way i did.&nbsp. toots for him to not feel bad* *gets out glue* tooter's right. you can make up with occy when you get home. now, let's glue this back together. super snail stick should do the trick. there, good as new. i jsut hope occy and i will be.&nbsp.   h no, occy's gone. wonders* no, he's not coming back. i've got to find him. *searches for him later* occy. occy. oots for him as well* *exhausted and runs into a coral tree* it's no use, allstar. it's getting too dark to search. you're right. *use flashlights through snorks*   and i've been looking for him all morning, uncle gallio. yes, the ocean is a fine place to hide. you might have to wait until occy decides to come home. no, i'll keep looking right after my sea science class.  <transition>  get out of here, you ten armed tresspassers. i'll teach ya to jump saltwater sam's claim. *grabs one with his lasso* every year, you migrating varmits cme to slug my salt. *occy watches and gets angry* but now i've got ya. tries to attack but he gets caught too* both of ya. yes, there's salt in them thar hils. but it took years to find, and it's all mine. that's what he thinks. huffer, pluffer, show that snork what real claim jumping is. ure thing, slugwart. just let us catch our breath. *blow down all three* ooh, who are you. we're with him. he sanme's slugwart. gulps* not the salt master. that's right, fish face. and your salt mine is mine. *laughs* so get to work. i need a hundred pounds by &nbsp.dinnertime. *occy and squid* hmm, they've got plenty of storng arms. put em to work. *they gripe*  allstar, wait, you won first prize. dn't you want your picture in the snorkland gazzette.&nbsp. i just want occy to be back home when i jet there. *but he isn't* but he's not. i've got to find him. he might be in deep trouble.  if i don't get my salt quarter for supper, you're all going to be in trouble. faster. that snakeriding slugwart is working your tentacles to the bone. maybe we can make a break.  t's no use, uncle gallio. i can't find occy anywhere. it's like he dropped off the face of the ocean. m afraid all you can do now is wait and rest. you look exhauted.&nbsp.  eating* oh this is high quality seasalt, delicious. i'm in a good mood, so you can take a break. : it's about time. *all fall down* yeah, it sure looks desperate. i don't wish to have some friends, &nbsp.but i could sure use one now. gets out picture of him and allstar and cries*&nbsp. hey, looks like you've got a friend in snorkland. reckon he could help. does he know you're here. *still cries when squid takes picture and swims off with it* : that's not the kind of break i meant. stop him. *blow him away* maybe knowing no friends will find help.  thanks for letting me sleepover, uncle gallio. m honored to have had the school's science contest winner as a guest. but even without occy around, winning first prize isn't fun anymore.&nbsp.  : what's wrong, little squid. but that's me and occy. where'd you get this. is occy in trouble. *gets him to go* then what are we waiting for..&nbsp.  nothing like breakfast in bed a salt bed.&nbsp. occy's in deeper trouble than i thought. he's a slave to that slimy salt dipper slugwart. but where are his two bighead blowfish bodyguards. blow him tehre* oh, i'm sorry i asked. *occy catches the bubble gun*&nbsp. well, if it isn't that meddling knowitall allstar, adn the kid squid. get to work, boys. occy, get cranking. *uses bubble gum to place the guards in a bubble, for which they can't get out of* you bubble brains, where do you think you're going.. *they leave* you can't leave me here now. i'm outnumbered.&nbsp. places slugwart in a bubble, and the squid kicks him out* oh, i don't think you'll be seeing him again, *gives the gun to sam* as long as you have this bubble gun around. *shakes hands with him* hey, thanks son. saltwater sam owes ya one.&nbsp. : and i owe you an apology, occy. i should learn to control my temper.  suffering seashells, occy. why is your little friend so sad. yeah, i'm afraid that's my fault. i cahsed all his friends away.  gee i'm sorry, little fella, but mom would never let me have another pet.&nbsp. *lassos it* eh, it's a might lonesome out here. *gets licked by him* and i could use a creature around the place, especially one who's already used to salt mining.&nbsp. looks like your friend's found a good home, occy. now we better jet home too.&nbsp.  well come back and see us soon, ya hear.&nbsp. *says goodbyes* come on, occy, we don't have all day. i mean, i mean, take your time, occy. don't rush on my account. : *quickly swims back home* : *follows him* occy, wait up. occy, wait up.&nbsp.
