yeah, well, i don't do windows, and ovens are extra too, okay. oh, but i still won't make it in time. it'll take me at least five minutes to get to the field, and i'm still not dressed. *she gets changed with the wand into her cheer uniform and a mardi gras mask to cover her face she takes a look at herself in the mirror and gasps with shear delight* great. but, why the mask. well someone sabotaged you once, they're bound to do it again. you gotta keep yourself under disguise. boy, great idea. now all we have to do is find you some transportation. hmm, those seahorses should do just fine.  now what. just wait, hon, this is the best part of all. *laughs, but then turns them into a carriage for casey to ride in* wow. this is just like in a real fairy tale. well what do you think
