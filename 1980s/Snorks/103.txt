the water rodeo. ets throw into the hay by his horse* gosh, i've always been a sucker for a purty face. *horse tries kissing him* now cut that out.  *to tooter* here you go. two tickets to the snork hockey playoffs. *excited, then hands one to dimmy*&nbsp. thanks, tooter. one for me, and one for my best friend. you're a lucky lady. you jsut got the last two tickets. hey. wait just a snork second,

but this extra ticket is for daffney. *leaves, leaving allstar with a confused look* *laughs* looks like we're both in the same boat, allwet.  daffney, you're just in time to observe these fascinating bobfish.&nbsp. fascinating.. they're awful to each other. well that's normal. they may have a strange way of showing it, but the bobfish are close friends. suffering seashells, friends like that could be a headache. uncle gallio, daffney, i've got great news. : me too. you both got a's in seaography. better. i bought us tickets to the snork hockey playoffs. : well i bought us tickets to the water rodeo. *they trade tickets* oh, that's clamtastic. tickets to the water rodeo. and tickets to the snork hockey playoffs. *gasps* hold it. they're both this afternoon. so the solution is very simple one of you will just have to return your tickets. why don't you return your's. we always do what you want. what i want.. it always has to be your way. my way.. you must be off your reef. uncle gallio, what's all the fuss about. oh, it's just a little misunderstanding. huh, misunderstanding.. she's miss ungreatful. i'm going to the rodeo with or without you. well enjoy yourself, cause i'll go to the hockey game, and i'll find someone a lot nicer to give your ticket to. *leaves angry* you know, casey, you look beautiful when you're angry. how about you and me goin' to the game together. oh, get lost, junior. i'm afraid some things in life are more important than playoff tickets, junior. oh yeah.. obviously, you haven't seen what the ticket scallops are charging.  you know, we haven't won a water rodeo in ages, jimmy bob. we're flat broke. right, bobby jim. the tides are turnin'. look there. *shows up in a cute cowgirl outfit* oh, i better find a good seat. the bestest seat is on the back of a trusted seahorse, ma'am. oh, i just came to watch. besides, i'm not a very good seahorse rider. then you're in luck. the jimmy bob and bobby jim school of water rodeo has just one openin' left. school of water rodeo.. *jimmy bob puts down his hat to cover his snork* oh, that school of water rodeo. *he places it back on*&nbsp. oh, i don't think i can afford it, partners. i'm down to my

could've saved myself 50 bucks, and a stiff neck.&nbsp. on tv* we interrupt the playoffs to bring you a special bulliten. *show daffney*&nbsp. oh, who wants to watch seahorse racing.. that's no race your watching. it's a runaway seahorse just from barnacle bill's rodeo. but, but that looks like daffney. carrying away daffney gillfin. is daffney. and it looks like she's in real trouble.&nbsp. es, she'll be in real trouble if that horse carries her in vertical valley. now, back to the gaem. *leaves* not for me, i've got to help daffney. if you're leaving, casey, can i have your seat. casey, wait. *leaves too* h nevermind, i'll take allstar's seat. let's watch the game together, huh guys. : no way.&nbsp. : *sticks his tongue out at him as they too leave the game* oh, at least he left me his shellevision. *takes it away*  thanks for helping me look for our friend. f we can't spot her from up here, we'll never spot her. oh, if we hadn't argued, this never would've happened. don't worry, casey, daffney will be fine as long as she doesn't go into vertical valley.  oh no, she just entered vertical valley. school dismissed. *gets away from her* whoa shelley, please, stop, stop. you're running towards that terrible whirlpool. help. help. oh, i wish casey was here. she'd know what to do.&nbsp. *shows up* i hope you're right. hang on. i'mright behind you. now for some teamwork. pull. *they do so, and stop shelley* phew. oh, i still say we make a pretty good team. and i'd say you're right.&nbsp. cheer for them*  so from now on, we'll discuss what we do before we do it. right, daffney. for seasure, casey. our friendship's more important than a silly argument. i'm glad you two have made up. now which movie do you wanna see. i wanna see "beverly hills carp." ell i wanna see "goldfishbusters." carp. goldfish. toots for them to stop* hold it, let's not argue. i agree. so why don't we let tooter pick the movie. does just that*&nbsp. h no, not "raiders of the lost carp" for
