 snorkland aquatorium, dead ahead. oh, i've been looking forward to this science show for months. i can't wait to jet in. *then he has to tie occy on a leash outside*&nbsp. mopes in despair* but don't cry, occy, i'll try not to be long. and now my friends, i bring you my latest invention *unveils it* the minnow too riser.&nbsp.  what does it do, uncle gallio. do.. oh, good question, allstar. let's see. *tests it on junior's chair* hey. *it shrinks to the size of a minnow* suffering seashells, now the chair's as small as a little minnow. precisely that's why i named it the *stutters as he remembers* minnow too riser.  hey allstar, let me try that thing out. i wanna shrink my report card so my dad can't read it. sorry, junior. uncle gallio asked me to keep anyone from touching it.  m not just anyone, i'm dr., dr, ... *finneas whispers in his ear* strangesnork. *uses clam catcher to grab the invention behind allstar's back* oh come on, allwet, i won't break anything. i just wanna use it for a second. no way, junior. *finneas pops out from the clam catcher and grabs it* if anything happens to uncle gallio's invention, i'd never forgive myself. *he and finneas leave with the minnow too riser*&nbsp. *sees them and barks* oh come on, i'll give it right back. hey, where is that minnow too riser, anyway. ees it's gone* oh no, it's gone. *to friends* somebody stole uncle gallio's invention. hen we'll help you find it. *go outside as occy barks some more* if we split up, we can cover more water. then let's jet going. toots* occy, this is all my fault. *occy only barks some more* occy, what is your problem. *the octopus breaks free* occy, jet back here.&nbsp.  fishsticks, i'm being followed. *occy follows him as allstar follows his pet* home sweet home. *occy bumps into door as it closes* nice going, occy. instead of helping to find the missing invention, i'm out here in fornt of this mysterious laboratory helping you. *looks up at the lasers on the lab and gasps* mysterious laboratory.. i wonder who lives here...  <transition> *takes off disguise* so, you've come to stop me, eh. suffering seashells. i don't know who you are, but, you do look awfully familiar. you don't know who i am.. *laughs* you don't know who i am. why i'm, uh, um, who am i. *sees himself in finneas' hand mirror* i know that face, i'm, eh, why yes, dr. strangesnork that's me. *caresses the invention* o it was you who stole uncle gallio's invention. yes. i need my brother's device to help me conquer snorkland. rother.. oh no. you won't make me cry "uncle." and how come uncle gallio never mentioned you. he probably forgot you know how absentminded he is. *laughs* now, where was i. oh yes.&nbsp. i know your scheme, but you'll never be able to shrink all of snorkland. *takes out what looks like a giant camera* wrong scheme. i only want gallio's minnow too riser, so i an shrink my mind swapper. *does so, shrinking to a small handheld camera* there. *laughs* i've made my mind swapper portable. mind swapper..&nbsp. it swaps minds from one creature to another and i intend to, *stutters* what am i trying to do. hispers it to him* right. i intend to swap minds with governor wetworth when he gives his closing speech. then every snork will think you're the governor, and you can take over. now you've got it right, nephew. but first, i must try out my device. and to keep it in the family, i'll test it on you. *flashes it, and occy storms out, but not without crashing into some props first finneas also tries going after him* finneas, let go. well that waterlogged mutt messed up my experiment. *hear barking* cancel my last remark. in allstar's body, barking* it worked. the mind of that obnoxious octopus now inhabits this snork body, and my nosy nephew now has eight arms. *laughs* in occy's body as he leaves the lab* whew, i'm not being followed. *sees himself* these aren't my hands. suffering squids, my mind is in occy's body. octopus or not, i have to warn the governor before it's too late. time to become governor, finneas. you stay here and guard that snorky squid.&nbsp.  *hears him reciting his speech* and remember, fellow snorks, progress is my middle name. *junior writes all this down* got all that, junior. es, dad.&nbsp. trying to talk, but only barks like occy* t's that loudmouth pet of allstar. : no. junior, get the telephone and call the octopus catcher.&nbsp. thoughts* they can't understand me. i've got occy's voice as well as his body. *talking to octopus catchers once they arrive* it's about time you got here. catch that beast.&nbsp.  oh, if you want something done right, you have to do it yourself. *but allstar escapes and closes the door on him* on second thought, you do it.  trying to chase finneas) hey, there's allstar. nd that catfish must be the theif. come on. *toots a horn* *in town still* i can't find allstar anywhere. : *finds her and barks* occy. *they see the octopus catcher, and he hides behind her* hey, did an outofcontrol octopus pass this way, about so high, in a big hurry. oh yes, sir, he swam that way. thanks. grabs her* occy, where are you taking me. thoughts* there's only one way to make casey understand, and that's to drag her bak to strangesnork's lab.  occy, what is this place. my laboratory. *laughs as they're both palced in seperate cages* it's a good thing i didn't forget my minimind swapper, or i would've missed the pleasure of capturing you. who are you. who am i. who am i.. oh, why does everyone have to ask me that.. you're weird. dr. weird. that doesn't sound familiar. anyway, you are my prisoners. *laughs* and i have a date with the governor.  poor allstar. he's really flipped his snork. great grunnions. this isn't allstar. it's occy. only one twisted snork would be responsible for this my brother, dr. strangesnork. *occy still chases finneas* quick. don't let occy, eh, allstar, eh, whoever jet away. *all go after him*  uffering seashells, are you a sight for sore snorks. *releases them* where is strangesnork. on his way to the aquatorium. we've got to stop him.  and so fellow snorks, ask not what sea science can do for you, but you *all enter* i thought we got rid of that octopus. ut, but that's no octopus. that's allstar. *octopus catcher catches allstar in occy's body* got ya. ow, where was i. now disguised as a newspaper photographer* i'm with the daily snork, governor. how about a mind swap, eh, snap shot. *laughs* anything for the press. say mind swap finneas. "mind swap finneas.." whatever happened to "cheese.." *occy bumps into him* allstar seaworthy, you just ruined my picture. oh here, son, you take it. grabs the mind swapper* no, i'll take it. but you won't take me.  oy, are you in trouble, allstar. that's not allstar, governor. that's occy in allstar's body, and visa versa. observe. *snaps it, and they're all back to normal the real occy even licks the real allstar in response* my evil brother intended to take over your body, and take over snorkland.&nbsp. es, occy, i'm glad to see you. now i know what it's like to be you. oh, what is that horrible taste in my mouth.. hat, uh, occy's dinner. he ate it when he was you. moans and looks green around the gill* hate to admit it, but you are a hero, allstar. i am.. well if i am, so is occy. *barks* *clears throat* and now to finish my closing address. aren't you forgetting something. we must capture that bad brother of mine.  i bet that good brother of mine wants to capture me, but he'll have to find me first. *powers seaturtle and the lab leaves with it* those waterlogged fools haven't heard the last of dr, dr, eh uh... oh, come on, dr. strangesnork.   )
