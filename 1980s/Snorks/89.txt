 he sand witch is coming. she'll destroy us all. what kind of a witch is a sand witch. i don't know. maybe we'll find out at the town meeting.  quiet, everyone, please. let gallio speak. *reads out of a book* every few centuries, the terrible sand witch moves into our world. each time, she chooses a different place to appear, and i'm afraid that this time, she has chosen us. snorkland. *all gasp* the magic portal through which she passes has already begun to open just outside of town. what does the sand witch want. food. she eats anything that moves, and what she doesn't eat, she turns to sand. the last time she appeared, she attacked the seahara city. seahara city. don't you mean the seahara desert. sure now it's the seahara desert. but it used to be a city like our's. *grabs gallio in fear* ooh, we're doomed. nothing can save us from the sand witch. *pops out of crowd* don't lose control. this is a job for *horn* the snork patrol. really, corky, i think the sand witch is too powerful even for you. aybe, but just give me one hour to try and save snorkland. that's all i ask. alright one hour. but we'll start evacuation procedures just in case.  ooh, this is the chance we've been waiting for. finally, a way to get rid of these snorks. yeah, yeah, we've just gotta make sure corky doesn't stop this sand witch character. o problem. it's a piece of kelp. *put their disguises back on*  we wanna help, too. sorry, this job's too dangerous. i'll have to handle it alone. and now to seal that magic portal. *finds boulder nearby* ah, a large rock is just what the snork patrol ordered. *grabs it and places it in the magic portal front entrance* there, that should do it. *but it sinks down below*&nbsp. : *watching with everyone else* uh oh. it looks like the magic portal's still growing. *back in sub* i'll have to use full power. i guess i need a bigger boulder. *grabs one*&nbsp. here, i'll sabotage corky's sub. *grabs her* i'll get it. this is too important to have you messin' up. messin' up.. hmph, thanks a lot. *turns into a fish* ooh, corky will never suspect me now. *removes metal from the rutter of the sub* that oughta do it. bye bye, sucker. *but realizes he's stuck* oh no, i'm stuck. i can't get lose. great neptune. i lost control.&nbsp.  who's messing up now, huh. oh no. *and continue mumbling and gasping* oh no. corky has been sucked into the sand witch's domain.  way to go, bigweed. i should've known you were behind this. eah, well i'm glad i sabotaged your plans. i'm just sorry i got stuck here with you. well we better find a way to get back to snorkland before the sand witch shows up. i don't need your help, you... you... snork. i'll find a way back on my own. fine, i'll fix the sub by myself then. all i need is a new propeller. besides, i didn't want to work with a bad guy, anyway.&nbsp. <transition>  no wonder the sand witch wants to escape. ugh, there's nothing down here but junk.&nbsp.  oh, you've got to save me. i've been running away from the sand witch for a tousand years, and boy, am i tired.&nbsp. well you're welcome to come with me, but first i've got to find a new propeller for my sub. *follows him* what's a propeller. say, i could use you instead. you can. but wait a minute. have you ever had any experience as a propeller. no, but i'm a fast mover. great. here, i'll show you how to do it. first, you'll   i knew i could find my way out of here by myself. i just *ground moves* huh. *sees something move down below* uh oh. *pops out* who dares invade the domain of the sand witch. speak quickly while you still can. *stutters* i'll make a deal with you. you'll help me escape, and i'll help you find lots of fffood. i know my way around up there. *laughs* i don't need any help. i can find all the food i want, starting with you. oh no. looks like i'm about to become an appetizer. *sand witch chases after him, but he hides* i think i lost her. you haven't lost me. you've simply lost. *she still chases him*  quick, let me in. she's after me.&nbsp. ey bigweed, i thought you said you didn't need the snork patrol. hey, things didn't work out, okay. well, i guess the snork patrol should help everyone, even ugh bad guys.&nbsp. yeah, yeah, yeah, just hurry. *hides in the sub* we're approaching the magic portal.&nbsp. *sees something else move in the ground* what's that.  nobody escapes the sand witch. *shoots orange lasers out of her eyes*&nbsp. rut. the sand witch is blocking our escape route. i hate the thought of it, but we're gonna have to work together.&nbsp.  what a stupid disguise. they can't fool me. *reveals to be just ordinary seaweed, which she gladly takes a bite out of* mmm, delicious. but it could use a little more salt.&nbsp. *as he and bgiweed pass her by* it worked. she held for the decoy sub. *realizes it* no one makes a fool of the sand witch. no one.  *grabs boulder* now, to seal up the portal. *drops it there* *still watching from afar* yay. ah, there's nothing quite as satisfying as saving the world before lunch. *boulder breaks* uh oh. it looks like lunch will have to wait. the sand witch is trying to escape. ook, the magic portal is closing. : *as it closes on her* i wasted too much time. i can't get out. oooh. *now gone* we're saved. corky and bigweed have saved snorkland for another thousand years.&nbsp. as snorks swim up to him* how depressing.&nbsp. you saved the town. you're heroes.&nbsp. ay. no job's too big for *horn* the snork patrol. *to seastar* thanks, you made a great propeller. *dizzy* thanks, but i think i'll retire. i'm dizzy. isn't being a hero lots of fun. yeah, lot of fun. i hate that. *swims away angrily* i can't believe it, bigweed, you're a hero. how could you sink so low you'll never live it down. aaah, don't remind me.&nbsp.    )
