 sneezes then gets warmed up by the electric eel* oh, it certainly is strange weather for july. *he hears a knock on the door* come in.&nbsp.  gallio, what's going on. everyone in town wants to know why it's so cold. re you guys cold. *licks it* it is not cold. h, yes, i, i was just about to run a quick check on my weather monitor. *reads it* chill factor, current drift, ice formation, alright. *it shakes before it prints out a readable document for gallio*&nbsp. what's it say. it's cccold.&nbsp. sarcastically* big help. et's try the shellescope. *looks through it* take a look. *daffney looks at a large iceberg* that iceberg must be causing this foul weather. but i wonder what that dark shade in the corner could be. what can that ice block do to us, gallio.&nbsp. if we don't stop it, it could be the end of snorkland. h no. don't worry, i will stop it.&nbsp. you will. es. here is what i will need. *he tells them of his plan*&nbsp.  u won't make my friends cold anymore. take that. *but the hammer breaks* oops. okay, so you make my friends cold a little longer.&nbsp.  that hammer was made of sea shellion, the hardest substance known to snork. that ice must be super strong. it oculd have been frozen for hundreds, maybe thousands, of years. well i don't know about that. all i know is that this ice is positively ruining my curls. and i'm cold. *gets in the spot of sunlight in his room* ah. at least it's a little warmer in front of the window. if we took a bigger hammer what did you say..&nbsp. i said at least it's warmer  that's it. *kisses her cheek* you're a genuis, daffney. i've been called a lot of things, but genius isn't usually one of them. ome on, alberta einsnork, hurry up. maybe we can help.&nbsp.  bring the magnifying glass over here, daffney. *carries it* did you have to make it this heavy, gallio.&nbsp. well, the weight is a factor. *puts it down*&nbsp. *carries an ever bigger one with ease* how did you get these things so light, gallio.&nbsp. speaking of light, if the sunlight doesn't come out, this idea will do as much good as the last one.&nbsp.  ooh, saved by the light.  ake that, you troublemaking iceberg. *then it completely melts* boy, gallio, this is fun. i'm glad you like it. my arms are ready to fall off. ell, we're almost done. why don't you and gallio take a break. i'll finish up. thanks, jojo, don't mind if i do. snorkland's weather ought to be back to normal soon.&nbsp. boy, that's a relief. um, gallio, why do i fell like someone's watching us.&nbsp. don't know, daffney. this wall of ice could block anyone's view. wails then grabs both gallio and jojo* uh.&nbsp. ew, ick. what's the matter, daffney. mmmmosnter. mmmmosnter back there.&nbsp. nsense. come on, i'll show you. *laughs at his own reflection* there's your mosnter, daffney. you were scared by your own reflection. *laughs*&nbsp. nno. over thththere.  ees it and tries to run off before stopping to take a closer look at it*&nbsp. bbe cccareful. what is it. is is incredible. let's finish up and take this fellow back to the lab. i'll find out what it is.&nbsp.  imagine, a perfectly preserved specimen of a prehistoric snorkel sepian. it was two million years old. oh, i'll be studying it for years. but i'll have to keep it cold, so it won't melt. hat guy sure gave me a scare. but i guess a frozen snork can't hurt me. *wails again* what's the matter now. i thought you said a frozen snork couldn't hurt you. knknknow. but this one's not gonna be fffrozen for long. lllook.&nbsp.  hey, wait a minute. why am i hiding. i am not afraid. *swims over to ork*&nbsp. oks around* where this place. huh. huh.&nbsp. uh, me ork. who you.&nbsp. mazing. eww.&nbsp. lad to meet you, mazing and eww. my pleasure. *ork shakes him instead of

head. then everything go dark. then ork wake up here. wherever he is. ork better get back to tribe now. mazing. ork must have been covered by the iceberg in a matter of seconds. but ork, even though it seems like only a minute to you, over two million years have passed since your hunt.&nbsp. two million years, huh. is that more than, *holds up two fingers* this many. *laughs* i'm afraid it's many, many times more than that, ork.&nbsp. you pretty smart fellow, mazing. but ork think what you say not possible. ork go home now. bye. ow wait, hang on. we'll go with you. *he leaves already*
