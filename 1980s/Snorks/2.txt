 okay, dolph, i'm coming. king neptune knows when it's time to turn the tides. *blows it* there, now the tides will go out until i blow my golden shell again. *yawns* you better run along and play, dolph. i've done my duty. now it's time to get some shut eye. *on bed* watching over the seven seas is no bed of sea roses.  okay, junior, get ready for my special jetstreamed jump shot. *throws it with his snork* *catches the ball with his snork* piece of kelp, allwet. hey, snork the ball to me. *throws it back to his friends* jet lost, willie, this game's for full grown snorks. but me and kittyfish wanna play ball. *toots it's okay* yeah, junior, willie's old enough to play. *sadly swims away* come on, kittyfish, we'll find another place to play.  it's gone. my golden shell is missing. this is an aquatic emergency. without my shell the tides will keep going down, until the seas themselves run dry. *he and dolphin go out to find it* shake a tailfin, dolphin, we must start searching before the sea runs out.  junior. looks like willie wants to play, junior. junior, oh junior. on no, where can i hide the ball. *jams it in tooter's snork* see, willie, we're not playing snorkball, honest. who cares. i'm going to my new clubhouse. clubhouse. yeah, me and kittyfish found this neat clubhouse on the edge of town. wanna come see it. no, we're playing snorkball. okay, but you're really missing out. and i'm missing my ball. where's tooter. *sees tooter floating up* hey. where do you think you're going with my ball. *flies high* it must be the ball, toot, jet rid of the ball. *gets it out then floats back down* hey, that's a brand new snorkball. *grabs it* gotcha. *but it pops as he floats back down* nice going, tooter, there goes our snorkball game. don't blame tooter. i've never seen a snorkball rise like that before. everything's rising. *tries grabbing her books as they float up high* what in the whirlpool's going on, i eman going up. alsltar, help me. casey, let go of the books, i'll pull you down. *lassos her*&nbsp.  *laughs* you sure have pull with me, allstar. thanks, but i'm really worried. my uncle gallio will know what's going on.  uncle gallio. can't stop to chat, allstar. all of snorkland is about to float away.&nbsp. yeah, but why.&nbsp. it's the tides. come quickly, we must warn the governor.  t's a very serious problem, governor. everything is floating away, as you can see. you're telling me. everything in my office is floating away. *tries catching up with his stuff* *pulls out a drawing of how the tides are supposed to work* the problem is the tides. for some reason, the water levels keep on going down, down, down.&nbsp. *with pigtails going up* then why does everything keep going up, up, up. the less water above us, the less aquapressure. therefore, everything rises. *chases painting* like my priceless van snork original. *with net* it won't get far, dad. *goes through painting* who's in that picture, uncle gallio. you mean junior. pulls painting out of junior* no, him. oh, king neptune. legend has it that he calls the tides to go up and down by blowing on a magic conk shell. of course that's not scientific fact, just an old legend. well don't just float there, do soemthing before thigns take a turn for the worse. *goes outside and gets flattened* allstar and i will check on the tides, governor. and i'm gonna help my dad. *blows into his snork to unflaten him* gently, junior, gently. <transition>  we're here. where's here.&nbsp. he dry water marks. *sees markers* galloping groupers, who are those marks. hey were made years ago by ancient snorks to judge the meters of dry space. *takes out shellescope* i'll look through my shellescope to tell us how low the ideas are. i'll jsut jet up here for a minute. now let's see, my, it's very serious. *snorkeater ceeps up behind him as gallio unknowingly stands on it* the ocean's in the low water &nbsp.mark. allstar, your claw's in the way. claw.. oh that's not me, uncle gallio, it's just that snorkeater. snorkeater.. *looks behind him as snorkeater tries to eat him* snorkeater.. forget about me, allstar. save your own snork. snorkeater, be gone.  uncle gallio, look, it's neptune. slippery seaweed, then the legend is true.  um, thanks for saving us, king neptune, sir. glad to be of help, little fellers, but now, i need your help.  oh yeah sure, and then king neptune asked you soggy snorks to help him find his magic shell. he thought the tides might've carried it somewhere near snorkland. so we're going to look. neptune. magic shell. *laughs* i think this low aquapressure's made you guys dizzy. *laughs some more*&nbsp. oh go ahead, laugh your snork off, junior, but i believe them. *he believes them, too* i'll search the north side of town, tooter, you take the south side.&nbsp. ll search east to west. while i tell the governor about all this. good. my dad can use a good laugh. *laughs* this is no laughing matter, junior. allstar, junior. you guys wanna see my clubhouse. it's right nearby. i'd like to, willie, but i've got something really important to do. coming, junior. you must be out of your reef, allwet.&nbsp. wow, does that mean you'll come see my clubhouse, junior. on second thought, i'd rather see allstar and his goofy uncle make fools of themselves. *sadly swims away*  rising tidepools, if we don't find that conk shell soon, everything in snorkland will float away. *sees the many objects and snorks floating away* eat your kelp casserole, dear, before it floats away.  yeah, we didn't have any luck either, tooter. aw, all conked out. well what do you expect when your running errands for a legend. *laughs* *her head flatens* uh oh, this low pressure's making me lightheaded. *it's doing the same to him, as well*&nbsp. if we don't find that shell, we're all gonna be in trouble. speaking of toruble, here comes my kid brother again. my clubhouse is so close. won't you please come see it. pretty pelase. willie, a wetworth never begs, now will you pelase leave us alone. *cries* but's it's a clamtastic clubhouse, and no one will come visit. oh don't cry, willie, we'll go see your place, if you promise to let us take you home. take me home. sure. come on.  ell, isn't it beautiful.  well it's real nice, willie. nice.. it's just a big ugly shell. ugly shell.. well maybe if we took this seaweed off it, it'll look better. *realizes what it really is* huh. this looks like neptune's shell. give me a hand, guys. *they help him* oh no, you're wrecking my clubhouse. *blows into it* and now i suppose king neptune himself is gonna arrive, huh. i heard my conk. ay yai yai yai yai...  yes, king neptune, it's over here. and who can i thank for finding this. who can you thank. me. thank me. you're a hero. wow, a hero. and now, to turn the tides. *blows into his conk, and the tides finally return to normal*  this is gonna be the best clubhouse ever. there's even a special house of my kittyfish, and my dolphin doll king neptune gave me. and that's not all, we promise to never ignore you again. don't we, junior.&nbsp. yeah, yeah, yeah, we promise. and kittyfish and i can play snorkball with you. yeah, yeah, sure, you wha. no. absolutely not. that's where i put my foot down. *stopms and knocks down the special house* *laughs* looks like junior's in the dogfish house i mean, the kittyfish house. *laughs some more* *places his stuffed dolphin and kittyfish with junior* woo, this is more fun than playing snorkball. *moans*   )
