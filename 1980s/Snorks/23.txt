 quick, casey, hide in there. *they hide inside a cave as they watch bigweed on his sub*&nbsp. think we lost him. whoa, trust bigweed to show up when we have to collect plant speciments. yeah, there goes my a in marine biology. *sees strange looking plant* hey, look at that. *sees it change color* wow, what is it. *collects it* maybe gallio will know. but one thing's for sure, no one else is going to have one of these in their collection.&nbsp. looks like the coast is clear. *they leave before bigweed's sub arrives again* the neptunia plant has to be around here somewhere. what.. *sees allstar and casey with it* they have it. but not for long. yeah.  why it's a neptunia plant. it's such a rare plant, we thought it was extinct. but the things we can do with just one leaf, it's clamtastic. places it in his fridge for possible safekeeping* i better keep it somewhere safe. bah. they could be hiding the neptunia plant anywhere. it could take months to find it unless i can force them to hand it over. *evilly laughs* *laughs along with him* but first, i need a victim. *spots daffney and laughs* perfect. *with a high number of shopping bags and a long list of things to purchase* hmm, i wonder if i bought enough shoes. i wonder if i should move on to sweaters. gee, life is full of hard decisions. oh wow. *disguises himself as a shoe salesman* that's right, little lady. all shoes 90 percent off. oh, it's like a dream come true. yes, step right in. take a look around. see for yourself. *locks her in there and place ransom note outside* *catches it* oops, we missed a package. *reads it* great neptune.  "unless you bring me the neptunia plant at noon tomorrow, you'll never see the girl again. signed, bigweed." gallio: we can't let bigweed have the neptunia plant. this sounds like a job for *horn* the snork patrol. with your permission, governor, my hand selected rescue force will find daffney, and bring her back safe and sound.&nbsp.  ew, icky. this is a really weird shoe store. ut i've got news for you i'm not really a shoe saleman. uh. i should've guessed that from yor shoes. your taste is terrible. you don't understand, you unfortunate snork. *reveals his true self*&nbsp. ew. i liked your other face better.  this is an awfully long way to go for a shoe sale. i hope it's worth it. how many times do i have to tell you.. there are no shoes. oh really. then what do you sell. sweaters, i hope. *laughs*&nbsp. allow me to explain you have to stay here until your friends bring me a certain plant in their possession. *as she walks in her jail cell* oh, you're into plants. i guess a few plants would look nice in here.&nbsp. *to yucks* guard her. *he walks away* see ya later. *to yucks* you guys should really get in shape. in fact, i just heard about the funnest new way to work out. it's in here soemwhere. aha. *finds her cassette player with stereos attached to it* ready. *plays upbeat workout music*  now, all we have to do is prepare a salvent to destroy the essance of the neptunia plant. *dumps ingredients into a couldren* hmm, eyelash of jellyfish, what of a whale *ceiling crumbles a bit* what i nthe whirlpool.. *goes up to see daffney exercising with the yucks* 1, 2, 3, kick.&nbsp. 1 yuck, 2 yuck, 3 yuck,  : stop that. get out of here, you sludge brains. *they leave* : never trust a yuckyuck. crustaceans, guard her. *they do so* ha. hi. *they only mumble to her* <transition>  a pinch of perdust, the tears of a shark, yes that's everything. oh, this is gonna turn snorkland into the nastiest place in the seven seas. *evilly laughs* at last. *hears noises* what was that. *shurgs* mine. mine. gimme mine. what on surf.. i'll go see, bigweed. *goes upstairs* uh oh.&nbsp. fall down stairs with daffney's hair accessories* let go. mine. mine. *all fall on lil seaweed and tumble into bigweed's lab* must be losing my brine... s mine. she gave it to me. no, for me. i am more beautifuller. enough, you idiots. *all then turn to daffney, who somehow came downstairs* : guys. i told them they had to take turns. : never count on a crustacean. : seaweed, get her back to her cell. : with pelasure. *takes her* and don't fall for any of her tricks. *laughs* you kidding.. tricks.. what tricks. by the way, have you ever considered redecorating. some coral pink wallpaper, nice pictures, seascapes maybe. *obviously irritated* ooh. she can be my first into the essance of the neptunia plant.  you know, if i had hair like your's, i'd give myself a permanent weight. seriously, then i'd curl my lashes, then i'd do a mudbath for my skin. : mud.. of course. i don't suppose you have any though, huh.  stings of jellyfish, lips of a leech, my last one. maybe after i've taken all the fun out of snorkland, i'll put corks in their snorks. *laughs* corks in their snorks. *laughs some more until he sees daffney and lil seaweed together and gasps* *putting up pictures* a little to the left. doing lil seaweed's nails after giving her a mud facial wash* did you hear about that new plankton diet. o, how is it. *to bigweed* oh, hi boss. i won't be a sec. angry* my lab... lab.. oh, that icky stuff. *all the essance is destroyed* we found the perfect place for it.  o far, so good. but now comes the real test. bigweed and his guards are tough, but somehow we have to win for daffney's sake, and for the future of snorkland. ou can count on me, corky. when i say "charge," go for roke. ready, jojo. i am ready for anything. wait. please, take her. *runs out to them* i'll do anything you ask. give you anything i've got. i'll even leave you alone for a year, if you just take her away. *wails and grabs corky's leg in mercy* oh, sure. *he and jojo look at each other and shrug in confusion* oh, thank neptune.  bye bye. don't forget to write. *all wave goodbye to her* bye bye. *sheds a tear* lright, you spineless bunch of jellyfish. back to the castle.  and not only did our intrepid snork patrol risk everything to save their fellow  op, i'm hungry, pop. i want bacon and lettuce kelpburger. not now, willie. you'll have to make it yourself. *back to corky* as i was saying, their heroism sets an example for all snorks. opens the fridge and sees the neptunia plant* huh, funny lookin' lettuce. *gives corky the metal of honor* no, it's daffney who deserves this. *places it around her* she's the one who saved snorkland. oh, why didn't someone tell me. now now, the important thing is, now we're safe. great news. i found a way to put the plant's power into countless practical uses. this will change the way snorks live forever. i must get to work on the plant immediately.  excellent, follow me. *to fridge, where they see the plant's gone* this is preposterous. what could've happened to it. ightly burps* that was the best bacon, lettuce, and tomato kelpburger i've ever had. there was somethign special about it. *moans* i guess we'll just have to wait another thousand years. *comforting an upset daffney* well don't feel too bad, daffney. at least bigweed didn't get the plant either.&nbsp. yes, but to think. a 90 percent off shoe sale, and i missed out. oh no. *moans and runs out of the room*   )
