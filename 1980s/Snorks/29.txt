seaweed. *laughs* hey, where are we.. we are in a forbidden zone the only passage way to axillon. well, why'd ya slow down. must take to slow through these parts. we don't want to attract attention. the passage is patrolled by some unfriendly sea pirates, who don't like intruders. *after they smash into something* what was that. after seeing a sea pirate ship on her monitor* we've been spotted. after ship squirts the sub with water* do something, they're going to sink us.&nbsp. hang on to your snorks.&nbsp.  what are we gonna do now. we're doomed. maybe not. look, it's a meteor shower. *again, that's on her monitor* our only hope is to lure us up there.*she gets them into outer space again, and the ship falls back down into the ocean* we did it. we lost them. jumps* yeah, we're saved... sees meteor coming straight for them* we're not saved yet. hold on.&nbsp.  now i'll never make it to the axillon constellation in time. *cries* i've failed. i've let my father down. oh don't

does this birdfish look like. it's electric blue with a spotted red and yellow tail. why. cause look.  *gasps* that's it. the fabled flying birdfish. *they head inside the disco to try and retrieve it* look at them. *they all turn to her* uh oh, sorry, i meant him. *they go to the sea pirate* excuse me, sir, but i am in a desperate situation. i njeed a tailfeather from your birdfish. arg. *speaks alien language* what did he say. e said no, and to leave him alone. well, plead with him. speaks alien language to him* *sees lil seaweed and has hearts in his eyes. arg. *describes her beauty* hey, what did he say. i don't like the way he's looking at me. *giggles* well, that's obvious. it looks like he's got a crush on you. hey, that gives me an idea. oh no. i know what you're thinking. never, never. *runs off*  misreable dancing with that pirate* &nbsp.oh, help. ries getting birdfish, but fails* molly, this isn't working. h, alright. it's time for plan b. *spins them around, kncoking them over* rg. *alien language* grabs it* i got it. *then bumps into aliens, losing it, so the girls have no choice but to chase after it* rab it. *got him* got it. arg. *alien language* sees they're surrounded by angry aliens* uh oh. this doesn't look good. oh no. i must've left my laser weapon in the sub. *they try going after them, but lil seaweed jumps on them before they try to make an escape* hurry, to the space sub. main hatch, open.  are we heading back to your planet now, molly. oh i wish we were, but we still have to make one more stop. ut why. i thought we had all the ingredients. we do, but the ingredients are useless without the formula. well where do we get that. he only one who knows it is a wise old hermit, who lives at the bottom of the deepest crabbest on the floating asteroid reef, nebit. {commercial break}  gasps* there it is. *her and the others stand outside a house as she knocks on the front door* greetings, old wise one. i seek counsel. i am in dire need of your wisdom. *opens door* you guys had better wait out here. okay, but be careful. *as she paces around in nervousness, lil seaweed eats some candy* gosh, lil seaweed, how can you eat at a time like this. easy. i always eat when i'm this nervous. sees molly walking out even more nervous* what's wrong, molly. did you get the formula. well, not exactly. what do you mean. well, to get the formula, we must do the hermit a favor. oh no, this doesn't sound good. what do we have to do. ell, apparently, he has an incredible sweet tooth, and he won't give me the formula unless we give him a container full of sweet nectur. well where do we find this nectur.  t only spurts from the geyser at a cavern, at the top of the highest peak in the asteroid. *tries landing* ee, molly, it looks like there's nowhere to land. i know, but we must try. we don't have time to climb up the mountain. *they finally park and get out of the sub* come on, let's hurry. *inside the cave they see lava* look, there it is. *goes over to collect it* oh boy, this is, was easier than i thought. *they see ghosts, so she shoots them with her laser and they leave* main hutch, open.&nbsp.  alien language* alien language, wondering where the nectur is* what did he say. he wants the nectur first.&nbsp. *wonders why it's empty* lil seaweed, what happened to the nectur. i told you, when i get nervous, i eat. *cries in despair* ow look what you've done. didn't mean to eat it all. *idea* oh, but wait. i can undo what i've done. sees her candy bar and wants it*&nbsp. t worked. he says he even likes it better than nectur. he'll make the trade.  gasps in joy as she walks in* the antidote worked. we saved my father. lil seaweed, don't.  elp. get me outta here. *they pull her out* what kinda plant is that, anyway. s a vegetarian vacas, and it just loves seaweed. oh, how can i ever than you enough. well, for starters, how about that reward.&nbsp.  ow. gasps* jumps inside* wow, i'm rich. i'm rich.  ell, i guess this is enough. il seaweed, don't you think you overdid it a little. are you kidding. one stupid necklace just won'r do it for me.  what happened. oh no. my space sub couldn't take all the weight of the treasure.  how is it, molly. h, not good, i'm afraid. the engine is completely burned out. well, can't ya fix it. h, that would take days. oh no. i've got to get home. i don't have a few days. my parents will be so worried. *to lil seaweed* oh, this is all your fault. if you weren't so greedy,  oh, don't blame me. you saw her first trying to get a look at that stupid flying starfish. gasps* that's it. the flying starfish should be passing his way on the galaxy by any minute. i'll go radio him.  we must hurry. he'll be passing by here any minute.

flying starfish* there he is. to lil seaweed* hurry. you're not going to make it. *they get on him at just the right time* lil seaweed, dump the treasure. it's too heavy. we're gonna crash. never. never. *but she gives in anyway, only keeping a special pearl in her pocket* goodbye.  h oh. looks like we've got visitors.  unwelcomed visitors. oh, darnett. looks like we're going to collide. better fasten my kelp buckles.  well, look who's here. should've known he wouldn't give up. sheesh, some guys can't take "no" for an answer. *alien language* casey, please tell mr. persistent i'm not interested. alien language* i'm afraid he is, lil seaweed in the jewels, that is. why of all the nerve. he mustive been apying. rants he wasn't spying* what did he say. he said he wasn't spying, he just couldn't take his eyes off of you. i'll bet. *aliens boo her* what are we gonna do, casey. get rid of all the jewels.. arg. *alien language* he says if he can't have the jewels, then you'll be his real treasure. arg. *laughs* oh, gag me. *gets out giant white ruby* tell him i might jsut have one eensy weensy ruby somewhere in my seaweed. and it's all his if he just says "adios," "ariba," and "goodbye.' arg. *laughs with joy and kisses lil seaweed on the cheek, grossing her out* so long, romeo. nd hello, snorkland. here we come.  gee, lil seaweed. i'm sorry you had to give up all your
