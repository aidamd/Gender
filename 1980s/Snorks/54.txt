 dimmy, hold it, you forgot to rinse your plate. oh, sorry mom. *swims back inside to clean it* thanks, dimmy. can i go now, mom. &nbsp.yes, dimmy, i can see you're in *he leaves* a hurry. dimmy, hold it, did you forget something important. oops, you're right, dad. *swims back inside* i almost forgot the snorkoculars. *retrieves them* thanks, dad. oh, don't worry, i won't let them out of my sight, bye. *leaves them, but get them again* oops, i got a little ahead of myself.&nbsp.  i just hope dimmy jets here soon. i don't wanna miss a thing. oh i'm sure he'll be here any *dimmy swims by* minute. dimmy, what in the whirlpool took you so long. oh, i had to wash about 100 dishes at home. sounds like a big breakfast. well, let's jet going.&nbsp.  see what my dad loaned me. *shows off snorkoculars* wow, great snorkoculars. well it's only once a year that the flying fish come back to kelpastrato, and i want 'em to look their best.  according to my field guide to flying fishes, this is the spot. *all put seaweed around their snorks* now according to the guide, this seaweed will keep the flying fish from seeing us. and keep us from seeing them. shh, comething's coming. oh, i betcha it's a big whale.&nbsp. not quite, dimmy. well, it might grow up to be one. come on, we'll do our fishwatching over here. nah, too crowded. i bet i'll see more flying fish from this spot than any snork's ever seen before. dimmy, sit still. this seaweed may be good for hiding, but it's snorkawful for sitting. *sees through wrong end* hey, how'd you guys get so far away. dimmy, you're looking through the wrong ends. well, these deluxe snorkoculars are more complicated than regular ones. *sees tiny brown fish* hey, come quick. it's a colossal wolffish.  i don't see a wolffish.&nbsp. i don't see anything. there really was an awful, mean lookin' fish. *chuckles* sure, there was.&nbsp. *giggles* well, maybe it wasn't a wolffish, but it was something.&nbsp. well i don't wanna see anything except some flying fish. come on, allstar.  aye, bugfish, shoo, shoo. this is no fun. wait, i see something. *sees shadow of a dancign starfish* wow. allstar, casey, ccome quick. *they do* i've got the grandaddy of all starfish right in my sights. well, where is it. see for yourself.  dimmy, that's just an ordinary little starfish. please, dimmy, if you can't stop exaggerating, then try making less noise. you'll scare all the flying fish away. *adjusts snorkoculars* here, maybe now you can see what's really there. come on, allstar. *they leave him behind* i can't help. i've always had a vivid imagination. it keeps me from getting bored. hey guys, why don't we snork outta here and find a better spot. relax, just keep your snork on.&nbsp. suffering seashell. this is it. *sees flying hawkfish* this is the big one, no doubt about it. it's huge, it's snorkpendous, and it's a flying hawkfish. jet over here quick. allstar, you can check it out if you want to, but i've heard enough tall tales for one day. yeah, me too. *sees sparrowfish* hey look, a flock of sparrowfish, see them. yes. dimmy, look at all those cute little sparrowfish. nahuh. i've got bigger fish to fly. i'm keepin' my eyes on the hawkfish.  allstar, did you hear something. yeah. *laughs* these sparrowfish sure are noisy little fellas, aren't they.&nbsp. help, let me go, please. allstar, casey, any snork, help. don't drop me on my   snork. *three baby hawfish pop out to see him* three's comapny, and four's a crowd. i'm jettin' outta here. *they cry but mama hawkfish makes him stay* uh oh, maybe not. *sees them being fed worms, and she tries feeding dimmy some too* yuck. waterworms. no way i'm gonna *swallows one* yuck, that tasted even worse than i thought it would. now that i've had my dinner, may i be excused. *she lays on top of them* i wanted to see flying fish, but not this close.&nbsp.  i've never seen so many fish of a feather fly together. the guidebook's right it's a sight worth waiting a whole year for, no exaggeration. hey dimmy. *not seen* oh tidepools, when i asked dimmy to be quiet, i never thought he'd be this quiet. maybe seeing really incredible fish has him speechless.&nbsp.  look, you got it all wrong. i'm not your baby, i'm not even a fish, or a hawkfish. *she leaves* now's my chance. well, kids, it's been nice roomin' with ya, but it's time for me to fly the coup.&nbsp. *cry for him* <transition> poor little fins, your mama will be back soon. don't cry. *they do as he leaves* now don't cry, uncle dimmy's here. *mama makes him sit again* oops, back so soon. i don't know what i wanna be when i grow up, but it's definitely not a hawkfish. *feeds him more waterworms* not again. ever. *swallows one* yugh.  casey: that was a sight worth wrapping a snork in seaweed. yeah, not to mention sitting in this soggy stuff for hours. i don't know how dimmy stayed so quiet over there.&nbsp. there's one way to find out. *they go to him, but only the snorkoculars are there* shifing seabits, dimmy's gone. oh, you know dimmy. he probably got bored and found another lookout. nah uh, not without taking his father's best snorkoculars.&nbsp. like i said, why are we treading water. let's go find dimmy. *she takes his hand and they go search for him*  i always wanted brothers and sisters, but i thought they'd be snorks. *hears noise* i hope that's not my stomach growling, because i don't wanna eat again.&nbsp.  oh no, it's a wolffish. and he's worse than anythign i could've imagined.  hey, pick on some snork your own size. and that doesn't mean me. *they still fight* yikes, i guess that does mean me. *places stick in his mouth* mama, help. *she smacks him and he leaves dimmy's seaweed also falls off his snork* we did it, mama. *confused* that's what i've been tryin' to tell ya. i'm no fish, i'm a snork. see.&nbsp.  hey, that tickles. and i better jet goin'. my friends are waiting for me. *pats babies on heads* you be good now, little babyfins.&nbsp. *cries*  dimmy, where are you. dimmy. i'll check that clump of kelp over there. *leaves* i'll bet he's hiding in here. *swims to cave* dimmy. *turns to see something* uh on, there's a rare sight.&nbsp.  a mean and angry lone wolffish. help. wait until allstar and casey hear about the flying fish i've seen.&nbsp. *from cave* allstar, help.&nbsp. great guppies, sounds like casey's in trouble. *enters cave* casey, what is it. did you find dimmy. no, but we've got bigger problems.  yeah, i see what you mean. got any starbright ideas, allstar. yeah, uh, there must be another way out of here. *tries finding one* allstar, wait. *sees him hit his head* it's a dead end cave. *floats* so i noticed.&nbsp.  what do we do now.&nbsp. i think you had the right idea, casey. we scream our snorks off. help. help.  great tidepools, casey and allstar are both in trouble.  our snorks are against the wall.&nbsp. huh. looks liek i'm all out of ideas, and we're all out of luck.&nbsp.  there's no hawkfish to help me now. *grabs stick and puffer* maybe this'll work. *places several in the wolffish, who yelps in pain and then leaves* allstar. casey. *her and allstar swim to him* dimmy finster, where have you been. where have i been. i've just been savin' you from that wolffish. come on, dimmy, we're in no mood for stories. yeah, we barely escaped that wolffish by the skin of our snorks.&nbsp. thanks to me. hmm, sounds like a bunch of hot water to me.&nbsp. oh yeah. watch this. *demonstrates what he did*&nbsp. so that's what you did. exactly. but the wolffish got the point and turned tail. well that's the end of my story. but first, let me tell you about a giant hawkfish that picked me up and took me to her nest.&nbsp.  and then she fed me waterworms, yugh, because she thought i was one of her babies, and then  hold it, hold it. uh, what do you think, casey. well you may have saved us from the wolffish, but that giant hawkfish story is the tallest tale you've ever told.&nbsp. well it may sound wild, but it's true. see. *looks up with casey* well i'll be snorktied. i must have too much salt in my eyes. nope, that's them, alright. hi, mama. hi, little babyfins.  well, cork my snork. your story was true after all. i apologize for not believing you, dimmy.&nbsp. yeah, so do i. *hands him his binoculars back* i thought you were just exaggerating again.&nbsp. who, me. if i told ya once, i told ya a million times. i never exaggerate much. *wink*   )
