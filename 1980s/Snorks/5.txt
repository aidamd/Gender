snorkawumpa. here, you will learn how to survive in the wilderness, and how to do without the modern conviniences of home.&nbsp. boy, this is really roughing it. *laughs* you will also learn how to live in harmony with the creatures of the sea. you will also have the chance to win merrit badges in various skills, and whoever wins the most merrit badges will be named senior snork scout. that's for me. i'm a shoein. yeah, a shoein. *things fall on him* what's a shoein. now campers, choose your bunkmates, and start building your tents.&nbsp. daffney, why don't we be tentmates. oh, goody. we can bunk together, dimmy. great, but there's just one thing. what's that. i snore. oh that's alright, i'm a sound sleeper, noises don't bother me. *tooter toots very loudly* that is, most noises. *tooter's stuck* something's got tooter.  t's occy. well how did he get here. *licks them silly* what is that octopus doing here. *occy moans and walks away* well, as long as you're here, you might as well stick around. *occy licks him as well* you're welcome boy.  well, it looks like tooter has a bunkmate now. licks tooter as well*  are you sure we can build tents out of this stuff. , it'll be easy. *totoer and occy complete one very quickly* uh, maybe not that easy. *he and willie walk by with their very own tent* hm, building tents is for dopes. you got a better way, junior. i got the wetworth way. *pulls string and it blows into a house sized tent* i'm thinking of putting in a tennis court.  oh dimmy. ranger ripple taught me how to tie the cutest knot. look. *ties him up* now see if you can get out.&nbsp. *blushes* nope. you sure tie a great knot, daffney. now, untie me. oh, i didn't learn untying yet. no problem. *cuts it with scissors, making daffney mad* uh, thanks, junior. hefty little gadget if you can afford it. afford it.  guess i'm the snorkland fish calling champion. i broke the record. *breaks record* uh, i broke the record.  nice work, casey. shh, don't scare it away.  what happened. oh, this fish is gone. now i won't be able to finish my drawing. *hands her a picture of it looking scared* you can copy my picture, casey. don't worry, casey, there's a lot more fish in the sea.&nbsp. if junior doesn't scare them away.  now campers, to cook here in the wilderness, you have to make a camp steamer. allstar, would you show everyone how it's done. sure, ranger ripple. first, you find a warm spot on the ground that means there's a steam line undergorund. then, you drill. *steam pops out* and there you have it, a camp steamer. yay. oh boy, let's roast some plankburgers. &nbsp.do you wanna join us junior. willie. yeah. no thanks. we wetworths don't drill for steam we bring out own. *pops it out of a can and goes to the grill* a plank steak, a la wetworth, please. hmph. <transition>  tell us a story, ranger ripple. yeah, make up a scary one. oh i don't have to make up a scary story, dimmy. i'll tell you all about the phosphorous phantom. here in the woods, alte at night, when all of the naimals in the ocean are asleep in the deep, the phosphorous phantom prowls, searchign for its next victim. its favorite food is young snork. so, whenever it is very dark, and you see strange mysterious lights, getting closer, and closer, and closer watch out. it's the phantom. *all get really scared and fall off the edge of their seats, causing him to laugh* it's a good one, eh. well, don't worry. there's no such thing as the phosphorous phantom. *laugh* hat was a funny story, huh junior. *sees junior scared stiff* junior. *his brother falls down*&nbsp.  rise and shine, campers. after breakfast, you all will be going on your big nature hike. ooh, that'll be fun. and exciting. and delicious. the nature hike.. oh, i thought you all were talkin' about breakfast. where's junior. oh, he's probably still sleeping on his modern steam mattress.   *pants* can we stop and rest yet. we just started, junior.  halt. *all bump into him* occy, this pack is heavy enough. let's climb up the ridge. oh no.  *pants* at last. hm, it's getting late. we better head back. follow me.&nbsp. wait a minute, i'll lead the hide from now on. i've got a compass. i'll get us home in a jiffy. follow me. don't know about this. well he's got a compass, how lost can we get.  hey, that's the third time we've past that rock. that's impossible. this is a very expensive compass. very expensive. well maybe you're reading it wrong. read it. i just followed the arrow. oh no. the arrow always points north. you're supposed to know what direction to go in. well nobody told me. nobody. so much for modern onviniences. so where are we. we're lost. allstar: let's send occy to scout around. *he does so*  i'm cold. i'm hungry. *toots he's miserable* here comes occy. *he barks* he wants us to follow him. then let's go.  what is that. i've never seen anything like it. t might be an important discovery. let's check it out.  ooh, it's creepy in here. don't touch anything, it might be dnagerous. *junior shuts the window* oh no. *the ground begins to shake* what's that. t's thethe*stutters more as he sees a strage sight in front of him, really a man in scuba gear* the phosphorous phantom.&nbsp. thought there was no such thing. well someone should tell him.  oh, it sees us. we'll never get out of here alive. we're not through yet. *makes a steam line* if i'm right, we'll get out of here in no time. look out, allstar.  come on, let's snork out of here. keep going.  phew, that was close. what happened to the phantom. i don't know, but let's not wait around to find out.  and for his bravery, the senior snork scout merit badge goes to allstar seaworthy. *gives it to him* yay. wasn't scared of that old phantom. *sees light, yells, and is scard stiff again* *laughs as he's on a light fish* *laugh with him* oh, wait'll we tell everyone in snorkland what we saw. casey, they'd never believe us.  i, harry. say, what did you see down there. opens mask* you'll never believe me.&nbsp.   )
