thing supposed to do. well, gallio originally built it to communicate with sea creatures.&nbsp. and i've added a few improvements.&nbsp. you mean this thing really lets you talk to animals.&nbsp. yes, and it lets them talk back to you.&nbsp. allstar, the caves are dead ahead.&nbsp. hat was that. it sounded to me like the monster. we're going in for a closer look.  look, it's the snorkness mosnter. that mosnter looks pretty mad. let's get out of here. : uh oh, it's tracing us. i'll turn around. we'll face that monster. : what. standing by with the babbletron machine. standing by.&nbsp. okay,
