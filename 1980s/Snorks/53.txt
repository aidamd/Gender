the lamp whole* quick, grab the lamp. whoa, boy that was close. nothin' makes sense in this dimension. except everyone wants this lamp. of course, it's gold. gasps* that's not all it is.  we've got to get into that kitchen to find out what's going on, and i have a plan.  after he and bigweed are dressed in gypsy outfits and wigs* gee, bigweed, you look pretty cute. if you ever tell anyone about this, i'll feed you to a snorkeater.  here are those bumbling fatina sisters. they must not fail me. *they spy on him to see he's really the evil geenie in disguise* i must get that lamp back. was right. he is behind it. holy kelpsicles. i am the geenie of the lamp. if i don't get it back, i'll become powerless, and stuck in this dimension forever.&nbsp. if that's what's goin' on, we should be goin' out.  there you are, my desert's blossoms.&nbsp. i think my plan just backfired. grabs handroller* i think i'm gonna protect myself. did you get my magic lamp. *they giggle* you failed. you should be boiled in oil. *but bigweed jumps into his arms by accident* ah, but i would never boil a beauty like you. come to me, my little clam dip.&nbsp. let's get outta here before i get engaged.&nbsp.  imposters. head for the big door. *they try opening it, but can't* it's no use. we've got to find another way out. there's no escape. give me the lamp. *he tries catching them, but they escape* : here he comes. man the battle stations.&nbsp.  : you cannot defeat the power of the geenie~ : that's not the way we heard it. yeah. you're useless without the lamp. how is this for useless. 8turns into a giant whirlpool* how'd he do that. *runs* who cares.. run for your lives.  i seat you.&nbsp. eek.  look out. *they dodge it*&nbsp. step into my office. i got a plan. : *helps push a giant machine* whoa, that was too close. : look, the only way we're gonna get rid of this geenie is to send him back where he came from.&nbsp. arabia. no. inside the lamp. : listen, mr. smartysnork, that guy's an extra large he'll never fit in that lamp. but that's where he came from. we must've released the geenie when we broke the lamp.&nbsp. : so, how do we get him back in. you yell, "hey sal, back in the lamp." i'm trapped in the fifth dimension with a dreamer. come on, there's no time to lose.  i sure hope our homemade vaccum cleaner works. oh, we'll soon find out. ready. let's try it out. *tests it* when i get my hands on you two, i'll turn you int ominced cal. hurry up, hurry up, he's breakin' through... i'm goin' as fast as i can. it works. ready, bigweed.&nbsp. ready. as soon as he breaks through, i'll lead him to you. let's clean up this joint. : *breaks in* give me the lamp. : you want it.. come and get it. *runs as the vaccum makes some crackling noises* allstar, what's wrong. it won't work. if it doesn't, we're history.&nbsp. have waited 2,000 years to be released from my prison, and to possess the magic lamp.&nbsp. patience like that should be rewarded. crank it up allstar. *gets sucked in* what are you doing.. just cleanin' up the crumbs. i'll get you for this. *is gone* keep in touch. syanara. : *gets out lamp* reverse the vaccum. : gladly. *they suck him back into the lamp* hooray. *high five each other* we did it. never doubted you for a minute, kid. that vaccum cleaner trick gets them every time. *ground shakes* oh, terrific. we've captured the geenie, and now there's an earthquake. nope. the fifth dimension is crumbling. bigweed: what do ya mean. imple. when we released the geenie, we released the fifth dimension, too.&nbsp. get it. so now this crazy world is goin' back into the lamp, too. right. brace yourself for a wild ride.&nbsp.  i'm afraid to open my eyes. opens his eyes and looks around, then gasps* we're back. are you sure. no tunnerfish. no evil geenies. positive. *gasps* i'm home. dump sweet dump. what a day. oh, i'm sure i've lost the scavenger hunt. and that lamp turned out to be made of fool's gold. ou know what i recommend after a hard day's adventure in the fifth dimension. allstar, we think alike. food.  ou know, allstar, this could be the beginning of a beautiful relationship. t would never work. &nbsp.yeah, you're right. but let me make a suggestion this time, we pay for our dinner. &nbsp.absolutely. the price you pay for a free meal these days is just too high.   )
