might work.  ah, this is just clamtastic. an army of snorkeaters loose, and i'm stuck with my little brother.&nbsp. yeah, your little brother.  help. *gilroy roars* junior, that sounds like allstar. and a snorkeater.&nbsp. *covers willie's mouth* shh, keep undercover, and follow me. please, don't eat us, please.&nbsp. *acting out for them* i'm too young to be a snork snack. oh, have mercy. *winks at him*  what's all the racket. look dear, it's gilroy. *watching* great guppies. that snorkeater's got them cornered.  so far, so good. now, for the big finale. okay, guys, let's hit it.  &nbsp.*watching* oh, how horrible. even allstar didn't deserve a fate like that. *rubs stomach* those three snorks i ate sure tasted good, yuum. oh, gilroy, i'm so proud of you. i knew you could do it, son. look, it's jojo. it worked. me am so happy. *giggles* that fiend.&nbsp. yeah, that fiend. let's get him. *grabs him* hold it, that jojo's plenty tough. better let the snorkland guard handle him. *swim away* oh, i can't wait to tell the neighbors. *swims away with gilroy's dad* *to cave* psst, coast is clear. now you official snorkeater. thanks to you nice snorks. it was a pleeasure to meet you, and not have to eat you.&nbsp. i wish more snorkeaters felt that way. *nods his head in agreement*  and then, the ferocious snorkeater closed in on the kids, and, oh, it's too horrible to go on. *snorks rant* gee, i wonder if i can have allstar's snorkball mitt now. my fellow nsorks, we must find this vicious snorkeater, and stop him, before he eats again.*all go after him* i never thought i'd see the day that snorks helped a snorkeater. *warns them of snorkland guards* you're right, tooter. it is the snorkland guard.&nbsp. thanks again, jojo. you helped make me, and my whole family, very happy. *both he and jojo get captured and tangled up in nets* your days of helping snorkeaters get snork snacks are over, jojo.&nbsp. yeah, over. wait, me can explain. me innocent, so is gilroy. what did i tell you, dad. jojo's on a firstname basis with these guys.&nbsp. junior's right. tie him up. me not like be tied up. *escapes*&nbsp. stop him. *falls over* yeah, stop him. *as guards chase him, he breaks free from the nets* *after gilroy is tied up* well, at least we got the snorkeater. *sees above him, and he and the others swim away from gilroy's dad* &nbsp. *gets out of clam* thanks, clifford. it's alright. *sees chase* that snorkeater not play around. *stops him* pick on someone your own size. i like a snack with spirit. *chases him*&nbsp. *chews himself out of seaweed trap* most snorkeaters hate seaweed, but i love it. say, if jojo's in cahoots with the snorkeaters, how come that big snorkeater's chasing him. it's just a trick, dad to confuse us. *shoulder's tapped* willie, stop it. what's going on. aaah, ghosts, keep away. junior saw that little snorkeater eat you. *laughs* that was just a trick to make his parents think he ate snorks. because he'd really rather eat seaweed. *laughs himself silly* very funny, you mean it was all a big act. yes, but that's no act out there. my dad loves snorks, and he's about to eat jojo. *stops* keep away, me warning you. *laughs* i like supper with a sense of humor. dad, this one's mine. alright, son, bon appetit. better make it good, jojo. me make it real good. *tears off sticks and throws it around while screeching* you need some help, son. nope. he was one tough snork, though. tough, but tasty. *ah. *laughs* that's my boy.  i hope you learned a lesson, junior. yeah, jumping to conclusions can be hazardous to your health. junpimg to conclusions.. hey, i just call 'em like i see 'em. and i say you're gonna be seeing a hole in one.  *laughs* for once, junior right.&nbsp.   )
