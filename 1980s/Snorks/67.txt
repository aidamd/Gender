hates pirate, and we got int oa furiosu battle up, down, over and under, i fought the bloubin' beast for hours. i finally saved the annabella. and what you see afore you is what's left of that fateful meetin' between long john wetworth and moby snork. arg. wow. and since that day, i never flew the jolly roger cause i know that sea devil is out there lookin' for me. arg. now, off to bed with you

drops them down even lower*&nbsp. bon voyage, maties.  oh, this is awful. what are we gonna do. uick, penelope, untie me with your beak. ay yai, sir. *does so*&nbsp. i may be down, but never count long john wetworth out.&nbsp. ah. you got her, captain. *sees through telescope* uh oh. tharr she blows. *moby dick's under the ocean* let's bring down the mast and get outta here fast. *breaks the stick and turns them into rafts for alsltar and casey to use while he uses his hat* s it moby snork. arg, no time for questions, just paddle. arg. *as moby snork pops out of the ocean and they paddle faster* whoa.&nbsp. faster, mates, faster. paddle for your lives.&nbsp. whoa. *as moby snork tries eating them and they come across a hgue rock in the middle of the ocean* boulder. turn. we're gonna crash. urn.. we don't have breaks. how can we turn.. *they fly over the boulder* hold on, mates.&nbsp. as they are devoured by moby snork* no....  this place gives me the creeps. ah, it's only your imagination. this island's deserted. if you say so, but i keep getting the feeling we're not alone. we're not. there's three of us, and one big fat treasure. now you're talkin. the map says to take 40 paces north of skull rock. but, uh, all these rocks look like skulls. how do we know which is the right one. because i'm the leader. well, which one is it, big leader. well, uh, that one, of course. *points to the center one* so let's start diggin. i wanna be a millionaire by noon.  got an idea on how to get out. how about nah, that won't work. know. no, that won't work either. shiver me timbers. let's put on our thinking caps and fire up our imaginations. fire. of course. it's perfect. ho's got the sticks. takes paddles* how about these.&nbsp. good thinking, allstar, just like the snork scouts. cause where there's snorks, there's fire. and where there's fire, there's smoke. *snoke comes out of moby snork* we'll make this causy creature think twice before he tries to digest the hide of an old pirate like me, arg. *all cough at the snoke* hold out for your lives, little maties, cause we're about to be launched. tharr she blows.&nbsp. *gets them out, but moans* {commercial break}  don't understand it. i could've sworn that was the right one. oh, we've dug up every skull rock on this island.&nbsp. there's more holes than swiss cheese. t the map says the treasure is 40 paces in front of skull rock. : *takes the map* give me that. when we get back to civilization, i'm gonna buy you some glasses. what do ya mean. the map says the treasure can be found 40 paces in front of shell rock not skull rock. then that means all this time, we've been on the wrong rock. o kidding.&nbsp. then let's hit it. shell rock's on the otehr side of the island.  aha. there be the annabella, arg. when i get me claws on them sea rats,  may i be of some assistance. who are you. hugo's the name, being a hermit's my game. and you. we're castaways. oh, my word, that's awful. say, stranger, have you per chance seen any nogood for nothin sailors that shipwrecked us. what do they look like.&nbsp. well like a couple of old barnacles. yeah, one's big and one's little. and one more who looks like a sea skunk. ah, sea skunk. and smells bad. ndeed i have. i caught width of 'em this morning. *grabs him* where be they. see here, old chap, there's nothing to get worked up about. they are tryin' to steal me treasure. if you ask me, you'll be well rid of the treasure of forgotten isle. what do you mean.&nbsp. : whoever finds the treasure is in for quite a surprise.&nbsp. : yeah, millions and millions of golddeblum. but there's a catch the one who digs up the treasure will be cursed forever and eternity. how long be that. oh, about a lifetime.&nbsp. i've searched too long to give this gold up now. but long john, we don't anything bad to happen to you. ah, bad. don't worry, me little hearties, old long john ain't afraid of no curse. well if you must, i'll show you where your former friends are. *all follow him* but i'll have nothing to do with that tainted treasure.&nbsp.  bet it's worth millions. maybe billions. or even gillions. there's no such thing as gillions. bboy, you guys sure take the fffun out of gggreed. h, so help me, if we don't get rid of him soon, i'm gonna scream. as soon as we get the treasure back to the boat, it's bye bye stinky. oh, sounds like music to me. *touches the treasure and lightning strieks him* gee, what was that. i don't know, but let's get the treasure back to the ship.  not so fast, you blackhearted beast. *the villains scram with the treasure chest* after them, me hearties. that's me treasure they're runnin away with.  uick. we'll swing across. *do so, but hit a giant rock and fall down* here they are. after 'em.  come on, let's go. those guys are gettin close. ere, we'll cross on these rocks. *a "rockodile" eats her tail* a rockodile. 8sees her damage done* sheesh, tropical air conditioning.&nbsp. et's go. here they come. to the rockodiles* ah, get down, you blasted creature. *the nthey walk across them*  that's it. a little further. once we get to the top of the reef, it's smooth sailing to the harbor below. *panting* next time, let's steal paper money. it's not so heavy. there won't be a next time if you don't push harder. come on, we're almost there. *sees them from behind* yikes. here they come again. come on, maties. up we goin' after 'em. *the villains get the treasure onto the ship* blast. the buildrats have the annabella.  we won. we won. we're rich.&nbsp. no, dan. we're rich. ou're out of luck. what do ya mean. you're skunked and dunked. *they lock him inside the ship* it's smooth sailin' from hereon out.  *sees through long john's telescope* bigweed and lil weed. *gets the telescope* let me see. oh, i should've known. they're getting away with the gold you're gold, long john. *growls at the sight of them prancing around with his treasure* ou know, old sire, you're really quite lucky you didn't get that treasure. it really does have a curse. *as he steers the annabella* anchors away. into the lap of luxury. *sings* yo ho, blow the man down. what unstoppable pirates we are. hey, we should fly the jolly roger.  yo ho ho. they're getting away. h, but they won't be gettin' afar. those barnacle buildrats are flyin' the jolly roger. h oh, it's chow time for moby snork. *sing* we're salty old sailors who spin out to sea. yo ho, blow the man down. we stole all the treasure and gone out to sea, roll out the sails and blow the man down. swallows them whole*&nbsp. hey. who turned out the lights.. well, hugo, looks you were right about that curse. if you'd gotten that treasure, you'd be in moby snork's belly instead of those mutaineers.&nbsp. but i needed that treasure. no one cares about a worn out, penniless pirate like me. pish posh, that's ridiculous. *reveals he owns a fancy house nearby* wow. as you can see, i've got plenty of room here. you and penelope can stay with me. what.. you're willin' to take in an old sea dog like me. do like my peace and quiet, but it can get lonely out here too. i'd love some company. well, penelope, what do ya think. *sings* ah, i'm a salty old bird who's tired of the sea. living with hugo's what sooths you and me. *laughs* well put, penelope. i couldn't have said it any better meself. arg. yay... claps* very good.   )
