"goldisnork and the three barricudas." how about  no, no, how about "little red riding snork". ow hold your seahorses. since i'm the first up, i'll pick the story. hmm, let's see. *thinks for a second* oh i know "jill and the sea bean stalk." that's a great story. now i'll begin the story, next it's casey's turn, then junior's, then you allstar. now let's begin the story. oh, i almost forgot the most important thing. when it's your turn to tell the story, you can make anything happen. and i mean anything, understand. yeah, let's start. once upon a time, there was a grandfather, and his granddaughter named jill.  they were so poor, all they had was a cowfish. oh, woe is us. we're so poor. *checks cabinet* empty, and i'm so hungry. ries* oh grandfather, we haven't eaten in over a week.&nbsp. oh, my dear jill, i guess it's come to this. *with cowfish* here, take our last old possession the cowfish.&nbsp. oo. mooo. ries some more* oh, not the cowfish. yes, the cowfish, and you must sell it at market. *she takes it and leaves* jill, you must get enough money for food so it can last the winter.  so, jill went to market. oh, uh, yeah. and on jill's way to market, she met an unusually handsome vendor.  with whom she traded the cowfish for some old sea beans. hello, and where are you headed today. sorry, but i cannot stop, for i have to go to market and sell my cowfish. money. money will serve you no use. why, i have some sea beans. with sea beans, you can grow your own food, and never be hungry again. oh, they're very beautiful sea beans. but, all i have is my cowfish. well, i suppose i could trade you the beans for this skinny old cowfish.&nbsp. eally. out of the kindness of my heart. here. *gives them to her* then, the vendor turned around and sold the cowfish for a thousand clams.&nbsp. dd anotehr cowfish to your herd for only a thousand clams. *a peasant gives him the clams, which he counts for himself* wow, what a   laughs* sucker. but, little did the vendor know that jill was an advote collector of sea beans.&nbsp. laughs until he realizes what she had just said* collector of sea beans.. beans. *laughs some more* and she was almost sure these were really magic sea beans. hmm. magic sea beans.. nd you know what. she was right.  asps* i was right. it says right here that these magic beans can lead you to riches and health greater than you can imagine. so, jill heads straight back to grandfather's to tell him what a great deal she made. <transition>  so dear jill, how much money did you get for the cowfish. well, no money, grandfather, just these sea beans. *sees them and gets angry* and then grandfather became angry with jill, for being tricked so easily. what.. you brought back these stupid sea beans.. *throws them out the window* but, jill showed grandfather the book, and convinced him that the sea beans were magical.&nbsp. but look, grandfather. those aren't jsut any sea beans. it says right here those are magical sea beans. hmm, oh yes. i believe you're right. then they should grow, and show us a kingdom filled with untold treasures. good. now let's check on our beans.  wow.&nbsp. wowwie. unbelieveable.&nbsp. yippie. now go forth, my granddaughter, and bring back the untold treasures. yes, sir. *now about ready to climb on the sea bean stalk* goodbye, grandfather. and don't worry, i won't come back empty handed.&nbsp. goodbye, dear jill. and good luck. but, jill slipped, and fell back to the ground. whoa. *fell back down* that was quick. did you get the treasure. what happened. i think i slipped.  *keeps on laughing* : and so, jill once again began to climb up the sea bean stalk. hey, what about me.. later, allwet. but, little did they know, jill's long lost cousin jack had arrived at grandfather's, and jill was so happy to take jack along. *angry at junior once more*  ot so happy. ear jill, your dear cousin jack has come to visit. you can never tell when i'll pop in. i'll bet. jill, jack has offered to go help you with the treasure.&nbsp. oh, just my luck.&nbsp.  and,  and, then jill and jack climbed up the sea bean stalk. yeah, yeah. and then, they reached the top and broke through the ocean's surface and,  and there,  that's it. there was a giant castle, and jill just knew there was treasure inside.  look, we made it. oh, i just know there's treasure inside. treasure, i like that idea.&nbsp. and so, jack took the lead running to the castle.&nbsp. jill, wait for me. *he flies and gets stuck in sand, but jill walks past him as he gets himself out of there* you'd think i was stuck.. i was just, sanding on my head. i said run to the castle, not dive. *actually runs* so, jack got there first, and luckily the draw bridge was down.  and jack ran across the bridge as fast as he could. but, jack shouldn't have been in such a hurry. *yawns at her* becuase, he didn't realize there was a trap door beneath him. what..  uh oh. *he falls down into the water* and so, jill ran across the bridge, avoiding the trap door. and jill entered the castle, whose walls were gold, and floors were covered with piles of gems and treasures. *jumps up and down in excitement* we're rich. pops out* this is ridiculous. i don't need to seek the treasure, when i could own it. *evil grin*&nbsp. you're right, jack. little did jill know that jack was a giant in disguise.&nbsp. *as he gets taller and turns into a big giant* whoa.... sees this for herself* oh no.  alright. i can't take it anymore. you guys have been hoggin' the whole story, and i wanna be in it right now. okay, sure. the giant's greatest treasure was the rare, golden snork.  okay, that's better. who was his slave. what.. jill, fearing the giant might follow, decided to close the draw bridge.  put me down. put me down. let me go.  about to fall off* whoa. *about to slip too* oh. oh. yi.... but the giant was quick, and ran to the castle window.  but, the giant was so heavy, that his footsteps shook the castle, letting jill know exactly where he was. my, what heavy footsteps. the giant must be near. *leaves the treasure behind and blows air through her snork* blast off. opens window* yao... ikes. *locks window* phew. that was close. *jack keeps running and trying to get in*sounds like he's headed for the back door. *sees him outside* oh, this doesn't look good. *jack keeps on running* here goes nothing. *locks the door on him* let me in. i said, let me in. but, little did jill know the giant had a spare key under his doormat. *he unlocks and enters the castle* but this time, the giant tiptoed into the castle, unheard by jill.  *sees giant behind her* oh well, gotta go.&nbsp. *grabs her* caught ya.&nbsp. and now, the giant took the captured jill, and put her in his fish aquarium with all his other pets. giant lobster sees her and she swims from it* uh, help... oh boy, this story telling is fun.   and then the giant made the golden snork lay an egg. ay an egg. junior, you've gotta be kidding. i said, the giant snork made the golden snork lay a golden egg. *slams table with his fist in outrage* i said, lay an egg. oh, alright. *goes to a green nest, makes chicken sounds, then lays a golden egg* okay, here's your stupid egg.  wow. did you see that. *ducks from the lobster* take cover.  uh. *picks up lobster* what happened. *jill goes up to the table, where she meets the golden snork* hey, stop. *she carries the golden snork and leaves the castle after closing the draw bridge* fe fi fo mort, i sense the smell of a deep sea snork.&nbsp. this is great. now you can go home with me, and lay golden eggs for my grandfather and me. that's it. that's enough. and so the golden snork jumped to freedom, and planted some bushes, where he had hidden a motor boat for his escape. what's that. *drives by on his fast motor boat* where did he get the boat. you'd be amazed at what a few golden eggs can get you. *laughs*  laughs as junior and casey glare at him* hey, he can't change the story like that. oh yes he can. he's the storyteller. when it's his turn, he can do anything he wants to. yeah. and then the golden snork lived in the lap of luxury.  that oughta do it. *a group of hawaiian snorks give him a hulu* okay, girls, what should we do today. *they giggle some more* i know, how about some surfing. *they take him out to the water where he does his moves* thank you. *now he's sunbathing* well it loks like suntan time to me, girls. *they pamper him once again* thank you, girls. this is wonderful.  and since the golden snork was sound asleep, he didn't even notice that the giant had a ride on the island.&nbsp. and little did the giant know that jill was at the back of his head, clinging to his cap feather. *wakes up* hey, is there a storm going on. *sees jack the giant and runs from him, even up a tree* he giant, not being stupid, ran into the jungle, knowing the first place someone would hide is up a tree. sees the golden snork* i knew you'd be in a tree. but, the golden snork had a surprise for the giant.&nbsp.  then the golden snork spooted a tiger up ahead, and led the giant right to it.&nbsp.  but, little did the golden snork know that his dripping suntan oil left a trail leading right up to him.  i didn't know i left it loaded. *throws jill as a target to him* yikes. *bumps into him, getting suntan lotion all over themselves they slip out of jack's hands, however* and so, the giant opened his purse, and as jill and the golden snork came down, they landed in it. and before they could get away, he pulled the draw string shut. so the giant returned to his castle and victorious. *locks them up in his small trasure chest then flals asleep on the chair* but little did the giant know that jill's grandfather was hiding in the castle with magic dust.&nbsp. all that you are, all that you own, return to its size before you were grown. *blows some magic dust on jack, who shrinks back into his normal size*&nbsp. hey, what's going on here. *grandfather unlocks the chest and jill and the golden snork escape* please take me with you. don't leave me all alone. i didn't wanna be evil, but as a giant i had to. but now i'm good really. oh brother. *cries* okay. you can come with us.&nbsp. hank you, thank you.  oh golden snork, won't you lay us a golden egg. but, little did they know that when the golden snork touched the ocean floor, he became a handsome prince.&nbsp. *turns into a handsome prince* a frog. became a frog as well* catch that frog. *chases it around* got ya.&nbsp. then the frog became a handsome prince.&nbsp. a bronking seahorse. *also turns into a seahorse, which jill ends up riding on very uncomfortably*  i said a prince. said a bronking seahorse. prince. : seahorse. prince. *covers junior's mouth before he says another word* prince.  gets thrown off by the seahorse* *laughs* smiles at her*  and asked his new friends to come to his castle.&nbsp.  the end. hey, wait, i was just plotting my revenge. sorry junior, but he said "the end."  aww. you guys wanna play another story circle. yeah. *turns down the lights* but this time, i'll start. once upon a time...
