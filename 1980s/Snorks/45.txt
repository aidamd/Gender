 allstar, you drive. *gets in with daffney* daffney's in charge of the map, and junior, better load up some extra fuel. reading a comic book on top of the sub* yeah, yeah, don't worry. *flips over* hurry up, junior, or we'll be leaving without you. alright, hold your seahorses. i was just finishing super snork. &nbsp.*gets in* good luck finding plant specimens for the science contest, and remember allstar, no speeding. you got it. thanks again. *leaves* bye.  let's stick together. o way. i'm gonna win that five clam prize, and i'm not sharing with anyone. *goes off on his own until he finds some* oh, these'll do nicely. *unknowingly, they're eyestalks* hey, what's the big idea.. get out of my way. i'm busy, you big *ground shakes* huh.. *crab pops out* uh oh. *nervous laugh* just kidding. here, want a flower. *crab chases him until he find a rock* whew. boy, am i lucky. *falls into a burrow where he finds some rare ruby kelp* ruby kelp. wow, i've never seen this before. *takes out book* jumping jellyfish, it's not even in the book. *steals some and places large amounts into his backpack* i've got this science contest in the bag. *leaves to find the others*  don't you love my sea lily, junior. pretty boring compared to this. *shows off the ruby kelp* wow, it's so pretty. can i have one. keep your hands off my prize winning specimen.&nbsp. come on, you guys, we better get the sub back to corky. *turns it on but won't start* better add some more fuel, junior.&nbsp. oh no. i forgot. you did remember the fuel, didn't you. huh. oh uh sure, of course i did. oh uh, this'll take just a minute. *to fuel tank* oh, think junior, what would super snork do. hey, i know. i'll try some of this weird kelp. i mean, kelp is kelp. *places some in* what do ya know. it works. uh, just a minute. i'll feed in some more. *it finally starts up* no, that's okay, that's plenty. buckle up everyone.  what in the whirlpool.. allstar, i told you to take it easy. i'll have to give you a speeding ticket now, you know. well it's not my fault, corky. the sub is acting really weird. one little tap on the fuel peddle and it goes to warp speed.&nbsp. well, i'll just check out the old girl myself.&nbsp. be careful, it's got a lot of *speeds* kick. after the ride, and with fish surrounding him in dizziness* i don't know what turned this cunker into a, super high performance vehicle, but i'd pay money to find out. huh. why it's the new wetworth wonder fuel. that's what. and for just five clams, i'll sell ya three whole stalks. you've got yourself a deal. but corky, he just found that plant out in the wild somewhere.&nbsp. yeah, but you don't know where in the wild. i do. *corky gives him the money* and that's worth five clams, isn't it, corky.&nbsp. yes.  let's see what else this stuff can do. *places some of the ruby kelp in the toy and it flies by* wow. *dollar signs in his eyes* i'll be able to sell this to everybody. first, i have to stock up. *returns to the spot where he originally found the ruby kelp so he could gather some more* heh heh heh, i've got a gold mine here. i'm gonna be rolling in clams. <transition>  will this new fuel work on sea vaccums. hands some to her* sure, it works on everything. how much. four clams a stalk. what a good price. thanks. it is.. i'll take a stalk, too. uh, that'll be seven clams. seven. but she only paid four. supply and demand. you're still getting a bargain, don't ya think. *hands some to him*&nbsp. no, but i guess i can't kelp it. uh, one stalk, please. that'll be 10 clams. oh no fuel's worth paying through the snork. wait, wait, i made a mistake. it's nine and a half clams. : oh alright. *pays up and leaves* *laughs* this is going great. can i buy one. it'll cost you nine and a half clams. *holds it to her face* that's a lot, but it's so pretty, it's worth it. well, since you're such a close friend, for you, i'll make it nine and a quarter clams. wow, thanks. now i can by that gumball i've been saving up for.  gee, are you using that new wetworth wonder fuel. oh yeah, it's great. highest octane i ever saw.  uh, thanks anyway, but, i think i'm goin' back home. *leaves in embarrassment*  try this new brand of fuel, alice. *uses it* ay, this stuff is great.  et's see if this new fangled fertilizer is worth anything. *it works perfectly*  nothing like a broiled clamburger patty for lunch. and now snork watch brings you uptotheminute news on junior wetworth's new ruby kelp wonder fuel.&nbsp. did he say "ruby kelp". *grabs a book and reads about it while also looking it up on the computer* a single leaf excelerates ordinary snork vehicles to the speed of light, drives machinery through a month's work in minutes, and sprouts seeds into full grown plants while you watch. it has burned a hole in the competition, and taken over the fuel market. *prints out some information about it* just as i thought the discovery of the decade. *lunch boils over* hmm, rather well done. oh well. no time to eat anyway. i must alert the town.  sorry, i'm all out of kelp today. come back tomorrow. *places a sign up saying closed: temporarily out of stock as snorks leave in growling mumbles and then he's able to count all the money he earned* 1, 2, 3,  come on, junior. i said come back tomorrow. i'll have more then.  m on a roll now. i'll be a zillionaire by next week. oh no. *hardly any ruby kelp left* oh, even at 15 clams a piece, that's still only 30 clams. hey, i know. *laughs* i could squueeze a few more clams out of this deal yet.&nbsp.  get your maps to the ruby kelp. only five clams a piece. i'll buy one.  oh, i'm so smart, i can't stand it.  there's not enough for all of us. let's get that junior. he cheated us.&nbsp.  you slippery little town snork. we demand a refund.  has any snork seen junior. it's urgent that we find him. *junior pops out from hiding under the table* we thought ruby kelp was extinct until you found some. good work. now we have a chance to preserve the species. yeah, except he used it all up. nd then sold us these worthless maps. what.. oh no. if only we'd known in time. oh swell, way to go junior.  well you didn't exactly save any kelp yourselves.&nbsp. gasps* look everyone. *daffney swims by*&nbsp. o her ruuby kelp plant* i knew you'd like to go for a walk. isn't it nice out here. that's a very rare plant you have there, daffney. may i see it. hugs it* oh, i always thought you were special. *gives it to him* seedpods. with these seeds, we can raise more kelp plants. hooray.&nbsp. you'll have to pay back the clams for all those maps, junior.&nbsp. whoa. well, at least i still have the clams from my kelp sales. sorry. but that will have to go for a greenhouse to raise the seeds. besides, those plants were on public property.&nbsp. *cries in frustration*  a fortune in clams, and all i have left is my science prize. oh well. at least i didn't go to jail or anything. and, we still have my pretty plant to look at. uh, say daffney, you wouldn't wanna sell, would you. growls at him* nervously laughs* that's what i thought.   )
