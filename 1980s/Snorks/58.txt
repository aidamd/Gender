 those rocks up ahead will hag us from view.&nbsp. not if we crash into them.&nbsp. don't worry, jojo, i have an excellent sense of direction.&nbsp.  see. nothing to it.&nbsp.  hmm, i knew bigweed and lil seaweed were up to no good. but i didn't know how no good. but they are just moving a rock. yes, but that is the rock that imprisons the horrible ooze. and if ooze gets out, it could mean the end of snorkland the end of the ocean, even.&nbsp. *gasps* holy macarole. this is definitely a job for *horn* the snork patrol. it won't be long now.&nbsp. haul. *commands the electric eels to move the door to the hole*&nbsp. as soon as the top's off this prison, ooze will be free, and he hates snorks even more than we do, if that's possible.&nbsp. bigweed, stop. you can't release the horrible ooze. it's too dangerous.&nbsp. yeah, too dangerous for snorks. besides, you're too late, corky. look.&nbsp.  ooze is free at last.&nbsp. get those snorks. snorks. yes, ooze hate snorks.&nbsp. *laughs* that's what i was counting on. uh oh swim for it.  *laughs* this ooze is my kinda guy. soon, all of snorkland will feel the might of that horrible ooze.  oh, i love swimming to work.&nbsp. yes, it sure beats all the traffic on the snorkaway.&nbsp.  of course, there are worse things than traffic.&nbsp. you said it.&nbsp.  it's ooze. let me outta here. we've got to escape.  ooze like electricity. ooze get bigger. *laughs* ooze not like anyone escape. all my prisoners. *zaps them and takes them away*  who could've left the horrible ooze out. yeah, who'd be stupid enough to do that.&nbsp. did you hear that, lil seaweed. they're talkin' about me.&nbsp. eah, you sure showed them who was stupid enough.&nbsp.  you bad snorks. you made ooze stay in the hole for 500 years. now snorks stay in cave for 500 years.&nbsp. but our ancestors had to imprison you. you tried to destroy our homes.&nbsp. yeah. that's right. they had no choice.&nbsp. gee, that's right. ooze forgot. but you all stay in cave, anyway. *zaps them in with spiderweblike substance* good work, ooze, you captured all the snorks. the next thing i want you to do is attack the sea merchant village of nor. okay, but first, ooze want you to do something.&nbsp. sure, what is it. get in cave with others.&nbsp. what.. but i let you out. don't you have any gratitude. yes, ooze do. thanks a lot. now get in cave. *zaps him and lil seaweed in too*&nbsp. <transition>  uh, hi guys. let me guess, that you are a little upset with me, aren't you. i am way past upset.&nbsp. yeah, i told you it was a dumb idea.&nbsp. thanks, lil seaweed, i knew i could count on your support. bigweed, you know i'll have to arrest you for this and send you to jail. *snorks get angry* um, as soon as we get out of this jail.&nbsp. stop it, everyone. we can take care of bgiweed later. right now, we all have to get out of here before ooze grows to his full size.&nbsp. and you'll help us work on a plan, won't you, bigweed.&nbsp. oh sure, no problem. come to think of it, maybe i was a bit hasty at hating all of you.&nbsp. ooze tired, ooze need energy. *sees electric eels* electric eels are jsut what ooze wanted. *zaps them, and he gets bigger as they run away* ooze loves those energy lunches, so nutritious.&nbsp. oh, we've no more time to waste. we've got to find a way out.&nbsp. as much as i hate to help you guys, i have an idea. you know where the old sunken ship is. *whispers* and then after that, *whispers some more*&nbsp. *standing near cave entrance* oh, we better not let ooze know there's agiant electric eel in here.&nbsp. yeah, that would just give him mroe power.&nbsp. you have electric eel in there. stand back. *he zaps it and they all escape*&nbsp. t worked. now swim, swim.&nbsp.  uh, hi, again.&nbsp. ooze deal with you later. right now, ooze got to capture snorks.&nbsp. *yelps* ooze really angry now.&nbsp. we've got to reach the sunken ship before ooze catches us.&nbsp. don't worry, it's just up ahead.&nbsp. this way, quickly.  now to stop ooze. ooze angry, very mad.&nbsp. *ties him up* now we'll give you a teste of your own medicine.&nbsp.  wow. the ship's coming to life.&nbsp.  ooze not like this at all. ow. ow. &nbsp.<i>sailing, sailing, over the bounding man.</i> ooze losing energy. ooze being drained. it's not working. and that's not all. you're shrinking.&nbsp.  i guess you're not such a big shot after all, ooze. bad guys are never big shots, casey. if they were, they wouldn't be bad guys.&nbsp.  bigweed, why have you come back. well, since i let ooze out, i should be the one to put him back in.&nbsp. *higher pitched voice* ooze will get you for this. you are in big trouble. *places him in jar* oh yeah, you got me real worried. *seals him up* boy, that sure was a mistake. yes, being a bad guy is always a mistake. no, that he turned on me was a mistake. if he hadn't, things would've worked out great. *snorks look at him angrily* i mean, uh, would you believe i was just kiddin'. i didn't think so. *swims away* that's it, bigweed. you've gone too far this time. get him.&nbsp.  hault. you are a prisoner of *horn* the snork patrol.&nbsp.   )
