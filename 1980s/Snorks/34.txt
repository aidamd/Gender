 if my father says he really led the snorks to snorkland, then he did, didn't you dad.&nbsp. of course i did. *knocks on door* that's him, cheif featherfin's here, just act natural. *opens closet door and they all laugh* that's the closet, dad. i knew it was the closet, just wanted to make sure it was clean. *opens door*&nbsp. how. ooh, and how yourself. howdy, featherfin. snorks run from many a snorky since we were all together. oh chief, how simply wonderful to see you again. &nbsp. *scratches her chin* too bad you run away. you are pretty snorksquah. and she still is, cheif featherfin. oh george, now stop it. *giggles* o, my dad tells my that the two of you and davy snorkett led the snorks to snorkland.&nbsp. that true. he did. he did. see, i told you so. dad, plase tell us the story of davy snorkett, and how the snorks were won.&nbsp. well, once upon a time, many snork years ago, most of us lived in a place in the east called shellguard.&nbsp.  we were not happy with the way things were being run. we were forced to work in the kelp mines, and give most of our food to the tax gimmegrabbers. we also lived in cosntant fear of the slimemamanders.&nbsp. slimamanders. they sound worse than the snorkeaters. slimemamanders. snork for your life. *all swim away*&nbsp. we were at our snorks end, and had to do something. i just think it's time that we snorks moved out west to conk cove, where there's plenty of kelp for ever snork. you can count me in. and we'll have the freedom to pick any job we want. but the best thing is that there are no slimemamanders out west.&nbsp.  but, who wil lead us to the west. *arrives on his seahorse* davy snorkett's my name, snork scountin's my game. may i present our guide.&nbsp. is it dangerous. never fear, snorkett's here.&nbsp. how long will it take to get there. ooh, it'll take many a night to get there. the trail may be rough, and you'll wanna turn back. i'll never wanna come back. so, do we go west, young snorks.   move 'em out. westward ho, snorks. i wanna go back. don't be scared, mrs. kelp. we jsut have to get over this hill.&nbsp. i'm afraid, i'm afraid. ome on, come on, we can make it.&nbsp.  now what, snorkett. beats me. never had this happen before.&nbsp. i have an idea. *feeds them the kelpcakes*&nbsp. you're feeding them our kelp cakes. we've got to get over the hill. well, don't that beat all. the old snork nose back. *pushes it* what goes up must come down.  i can't watch. hault. i knew i could still do it. it's time to let the dust settle, and camp for the night.&nbsp.  *hands them food* there's not much felt, those kelp eating seahorses ate too many. it seemed like a good idea at the time. *takes a sea cactus* nothin' to worry about with these sea cactus around. not only can you drink from it, you can eat from it, too. here, try it for yourself.&nbsp. *tastes it, and is disgusted* tastes worse than it looks. what is it. there's somethin out there. and whatever it was, it's gone now.&nbsp. first a runaway wagon, then no food. what could possibly happen next.&nbsp.  now we'll never find conk cove. you mean we're lost.&nbsp. never fear, snorkett's here. we're almost there. well, which way. well let's see, uh, it's that way. *points at a diferent direction* oh, it's that a way, i'm sure of it. follow me, snorks. *he disappears into the sand and seaweed* well at least we know it isn't a slimeamander.  well, we have plenty to eat now. you mean we have to eat our way through this seaweed.. i hope not. then what. well don't look at me. i'm a leader, not a thinker. you know, wetworth, you're full of hot air.&nbsp. huh. we're all full of hot air. look. *gallio blows it with snork* that's how we'll do it, we'll use our snorks.&nbsp.  yeah, we'll huff then we'll puff, then we'll blow these weeds down.&nbsp. *sings*&nbsp.<i>on to conk cove, to conk cove, we will go.&nbsp.</i>*runs into snorkeater* yao, what are you.&nbsp. i'm a snorkeater. a snorkeater.. yeah, get it. that means i eat snorks. oh, that's what i was afraid of.&nbsp.  sorry, we can't stay for dinner. why don't you try a slimeamander. i'm having a real bad day.&nbsp. and it's about to get worse.  drat. these little eastern snorks are fast. *throws rocks at him* take that, you slippary seamonster.&nbsp.  catch me, i'm going to faint. *does so* indian fish, by golly. how. how. i was just going
