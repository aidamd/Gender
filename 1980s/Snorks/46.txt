 enjoying your triple decker seaburger, uncle gallio. *bites into it* i could use a bigger mouth. hey you call this a fast food divein.. speaking of big mouths. where's my quarter flounder. i have been waiting here for *sees watch is gone* my watch. okay, hand it over. what are you talking about.&nbsp. my waterproof oyster cased daydate digital watch. which one of you sneaky snorks stole it. oh keep your snork on, junior. everythime you lose soemthing, you blame it on everyone else.&nbsp. oh you can't fool me, allwet, i'll bet it's under here. *occy growls* you're a suspect too, occy, let me check those tentacles. *growls and chases him around* sounds like a guilty bark to me, allstar. you should keep this beast on a leash. hey, get away.  *gives occy his clamburger* amazing. occy's as gentle as a lambfish, except when around junior.&nbsp. that's becuase he hasn't forgotten when he belonged to junior.&nbsp. what. your occy was junior's pet.&nbsp. *growls* easy, occy. that was a long time ago.&nbsp. : three years, to be exact. it all started that day at school with junior yelling.&nbsp.  searches in locker* thief, help, thief. *dimmy runsinto him* dimmy, i shoulda known. the guilty party always returns to the scene of his crime. *slams him in the locker and shuts it* now hand it over, or you're staying in the slammer. junior wetworth, you let dimmy out this instant. but he stole my handcarved pearlin laid hair comb. *finds it in his back pocket* you mean this one.&nbsp. so, you stole it. oh, this is getting out of hand.&nbsp. ll say it is. i've got to protect myself from this school of *dimmy escapes and heads off with his friends* sneaky snorks.&nbsp.  *spits it out* put a stamp on it, cheapstake. so the suspicious junior sent his money to some mailorder company. and 6 to 8 weeks later, he got a package by an overnight express snail.&nbsp. it's here, it's here. if it's a boy, i'm gonna call it occy, and if it's a girl i'm gonna call it occy. *read note as he gets out the egg* instructions: shake well, then step back.  oh, my own attack puppy. now those jealous snorks will think twice before stealing my things. *laughs* that tickles. hey no more licking. you're on a strict training program from now on.&nbsp.  hred, occy, shred. one mangled morning paper coming up. *gives it back to him* no, no, i said shred, not fetch. *confused*&nbsp. here, i'll show you. *shreds it for him* now, you know what to do. *glues it back for him*&nbsp. oh no.  finally after days of rigorous traning, junior brought his, uh, attack puppy to school. rides occy around the halls then ties his leash to his locker* ha, outta my way. now don't let anybody near my locer except me. *barks that he'll follow his commands* s at his locker when he sees occy* what a cute little guy. *occy barks at him* hey, take it easy, i'm just dropping off some books in my locker. *things fall out* are you okay, boy. don't worry, i'll help you pick it up. junior will never know. *pats him* you're not so mean after all, are ya.  that very same day, ms. seabottom took the class on a picnic.&nbsp.  oops, missed. *frisbee hits him but he sees* oh, what a great time to practice your shredding, occy. shred, occy, shred. *occy goes after it, but gets stck in a small round bin*&nbsp. h, junior's little octopuppy's stuck. but i'm afraid we'll get attacked if we help.&nbsp. don't worry, follow me.  hey. get your tentacle picking hands off my pet.  you're welcome, occy, you're welcome. you see, casey, he's not mean.&nbsp. hey, what do you think you're doing to my pet.&nbsp. *whimpers*&nbsp. cut the act, occy. occy just wants to play. he's not supposed to play, he's supposed to shred. *picks him up* nice going, allwet. you've ruined weeks of rigorous training, he'll never be the same again. *takes him away* quiet, i don't wanna hear any excuses. : oh, poor occy. attention, class, time for our nature swim. *they swim to her* today, we're going to observe butterfly shrimp in their natural habitat. now whatever you do, don't disturd these timid creatures. they're very, very shy. don't disturd, just observe. who wants to watch butterfly shrimp when you can catch 'em. come on, occy, we'll show everybody how well i trained ya to track. occy, go get a butterfly shrimp.  wait'll allstar sees me bring back a real live butterfly shrimp. got ya, you little *baby snorkeater pops out* snorkeater..  oh, some roguh puppy you are. can't you see it's just a baby. they're cute and harmless until they become adults like that one. like that one.. *sees it and swims* oh great guppies, they're both after us. back to the park, we'll lose them in the crowd.  what in the whrilpool is all that racket.&nbsp. oh, it's just junior and his pet being chased by a couple of snorkeaters.&nbsp. norkeaters.. swim for your lives.  oh, it worked. we're off the hook, now let's jet out of here. *occy stays put* occy, that's a direct order. distract them. for the last time, you come right now or or i'll disown you.  m all out of starbright ideas this time.  occy, why are we stopping.&nbsp.  nice work, occy.  you saved our lives, allstar. and occy saved my life. now give me five. *occy twirls him around* oh wow, he gave me eight.  well, junior really meant what he said occy was disowned.&nbsp. *tosses his stuff out with occy* what good's an attack puppy that doesn't obey commands.  please, occy, on't cry, you can stay with me if you want. *occy whimpers* of course i mean it.&nbsp. *licks him to death*&nbsp. okay, okay, occy, you're welcome.  and we've been together ever since.  hat, it's still not ready.. look, i've been waiting fifteen minutes, you got snails working back there. h, i see you found your wristwatch, junior.&nbsp. sure, i left it under my bed. so what. well, so it at least lets us "theiving snorks" off the hook. wrong, allwet. the aqualine batteries are missing, and i know one of you has 'em. *growls at him and tries chasing him yet again* no, get away, scram. allstar, call your mutt off. well i'll try, junior, but you know as well as i do, occy's not good at obeying commands. *laughs* occy, come back here.   )
