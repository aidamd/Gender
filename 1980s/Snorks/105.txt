  junior's team is still ahead. we can tie them if dimmy and i win our events.  you can do it, dimmy. i know you can. *tries lifting weights* you can do it, demetrius. *tries desperately to lift high* don't call me that. *finally lifts it high then fall over* *hugs him* oh dimmy, you did it. a new record. we got a snork jumper ready to go. you wanna move that barbell. you must be tired, dimmy. i'll get it.  well if it isn't mr. allwet. after i beat you at snorknastics, i may be a good sport and invite you to the winner's part, and to play pinthetail on the loser. *laughs* sticks his tongue out at him* you better watch your step, junior. thanks. i'll remember that. *bumps into willie carrying his stuff, making those in the audience laugh*  : it's up to you now, allstar. if you win, we're the champs. i'll try my best. *swings, flips over, and back to more swinging then it's junior's turn* good luck, junior. i don't need luck, i have talent. *willie bumps into him and junior's hanigng upside down* get me down. junior was right that took talent. *blushes angrily as everyone else laughs at him*  great job, allstar. *with boxes* if at first you don't succeed, cheat. *laughs* cheat. *laughs* *jumps high in the sky with his shoes* hat's some jump. i smell a ratfish. *as he flies out of the stadium* the only way to fly. yikes. i can't stop. let's go. *all swim to his aid* where is he. i could've sworn  *inside a clam* let me out of here. don't jsut stand there. help. t's junior. he's in the clam. hurry. it's ugh clammy in here. *alsltar and dimmy open the clam, releasing him* i won, right. wrong. allstar did. you were disqualified. better luck next time, junior. ooh, i'll teach them to laugh at me. a wetworth doesn't get mad, he gets even. *clam locks him again* let me go. let me go.  *walks over to them* hi, junior. what's in the package. wouldn't you like to know. they'll find out soon enough. *laughs* soon enough. *laughs*  t last, at last. *drinks out of a small cup* ah. would anyone else like some tea. no thanks, uncle gallio. can you help me with my invention. yes, yes, of course. let's take a look at it. *reveals a mechanical blowfish*&nbsp.  ou're right, tooter, it does look like a blowfish. that's why i call it project blowfish. i plan to launch it into dry space. *in awe* how do you fit into it. oh no, dimmy, it's not designed for passengers. *opens the compartment* after it's launched, it'll collect samples of dry space and return them to snorkland, so uncle gallio and i can study them. when should we launch it, uncle gallio. polly the parrotfish shows up* well, since we can't let the governor find out about it, i suggest early tomorrow morning, before anyone in snorkland is awake, from the high ridge near the western limit.  *as it goes up* 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, lift off. hooray. i wonder what it'll find. do you think it'll ever come back. well, as my uncle gallio says, what comes up,  must come down. junior. growls at him* what are you doing here. yeah. *picks up a sea flower and smells it* it's such a beautiful morning. i thought i'd come enjoy the view. did you, uh, see anything. me. no, i didn't see anything. phew. just project blowfish. huh.. i'm sure my father, the governor, will find it very interesting. *he leaves* how could junior have known. aybe it's just a lucky guess. toots he doesn't know, either* f you ask me, project blowfish just sprang a leak. <transition>  good job, dimmy. okay, team, i wanna be sure we win the big game tonight. i'd sure like to show that junior up. *polly shows up again* we can't lose with my new secret weapon. *occy plays eight balls with his tentacles* no, occy, not you. *holds up a diagram* my secret weapon is called the old snork statue play. look at this diagram casey drew. now, i fade back to pass, and dimmy circles around, and *polly leaves again*  now's the time for the old snork statue play. let's go. how's it feel to lose. i don't know, junior. you'll have to tell me sometime. *grabs the ball, but junior grabs it and shoots through the hoop, making him win* and the game is over. junior's team win. junior read that play perfectly. it's more like he read our minds. i don't mind losing, i just hate to see junior win.&nbsp. there's only one way junior could've known about the snork statue play and project blowfish. somebody told him. but which snork snitched.  know i didn't tell junior, and the rest of you say you didn't tell junior, and tooter can't tell junior, so the problem is who told junior. we're the only ones that knew. i just hope we don't let my uncle gallio down. if junior finds out about project splashdown, we're all in big trouble. you mean the blowfish is coming back down. *he and the others shh her* uncle gallio wants us to meet at his lab in one hour. remember, don't talk to anyone about it. especially junior. *polly the parrotfish leaves*  we wetworths have always been superior sportsmen, son. olly want a seaweed cracker. easy, polly. now, tell me what you've heard. blowfish coming back down. gallio's lab. don't tell junior. : junior, do you mean to tell me that you've been using your pet parrotfish to reco recu to spy.. yes, dad. oh, i wish i'd thought of that. that's how i found out about allstar's secret invention. polly says the blowfish is coming back down. hmm, if i only knew where it was coming back down. we could catch them in the act  and put a stop to those dangerous adventures once and for all. go to gallio's lab, polly. spy on allstar. *polly heads over there* soon, that goodygoody allstar will be in big trouble and i, junior wetworth, will be a hero.  *demosntrating the plan with a map* now, if my calculations are correct, blowfish will splash down exactly  wait a minute uncle gallio, maybe you shouldn't tell us. yeah, sure haven't been able to keep a secret. you'd think one of us is a snitch. nonsense. there has to be some other explanation. you all are fine, outstanding young snorks. i trust each and every one of you. *pats stomach* oh, i know what would make me feel better. i'm sorry, dimmy, all i can offer you is some stale seaweed crackers. *holds one* here you are, dim  oh, i want a seaweed cracker. aw, how cute, it's a parrotfish. give it a cracker, dr. gallio. *eats it* spy on allstar. blowfish back down. i junior wetworth hero. that's how junior did it. now i remember seeing that parrotfish around. you see. i told you there was an explanation. *pulls up sleeve and clenches fist* wait'll i get my hands on junior. wait, i have a better idea. here's what we'll do, listen. *he whispers the plan to them, and they laugh about it*  polly want a seaweed cracker. feed it. feed it. does so* okay, polly, what did you hear. blowfish coming down. ink farm. ink farm. tomorrow. perfect. we'll hide at the ink farm tomorrow and catch them in the act. oh, you know, junior, you may be governor yet.. aw, gee, thanks, dad.  he blowfish landed just where uncle gallio said it would. laughs* we sure fooled junior. *laughs* that sure was a good idea, allstar. *laughs* feeding the wrong information to that parrotfish. *laughs* i wonder how junior and the governor are doing at their visit to the ink farm. *laugh simultaneously* *shows up* what..  whispers* now, we have to be completely quiet. these squid are very sensitive. fooled junior. perfect landing.  do you know what this means, junior uh, no. what, dad. no allowance for a year... *stomps away*&nbsp. polly want a seaweed cracker. ah, shut up.   )
