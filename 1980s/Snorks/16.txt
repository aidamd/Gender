withstand the domining power of my chop machine. nice set of molars you have there, bigweed.&nbsp. pretty impressive, huh. not bad, bigweed, but take a look at this. it's my new invention, the goop gun. *tests it on stuffed snork*&nbsp. what is this stuff *gets stuck to it as lil seaweed laughs* hey. *more stickiness and laughter* that goop gun is no weapon, it's a meance. and it's not funny, either.&nbsp. whatever you say, boss. not i want you to go spy on the snorks. spying. oh boy.&nbsp. it's time for their annual defense of snorkland awards.&nbsp. is that the one to honor the best snork invention to protect their city. yes, very good, lil seaweed. now quit messin' around with silly children's toys like that goop gun, and go do something useful. *goes to her clothes wrack and mocks him* <i>and go do something useful.</i>&nbsp.*leaves lair looking like an elderly woman* what does bigweed know. he thinks the snorks will jsut stand still, and that chop machine of his run off over him. *arrives at town hall* ha.  ladies and gentlesnorks, i am please to announce the three finalists for the defense of snrokland award.&nbsp. the others haven't got a hope. when everyone sees my invention in action, they'll really be knocked out. first of all, we have a surprising invention from jojo.&nbsp. *sneers* jojo says that we could use these rocks to throw at the approaching enemy.&nbsp. huh. *mumble* boy, that jojo's a genius. ha. i'm sure to win.&nbsp. and here, we have a model of allstar seaworthy's invention. it's a queen conk distant early warning system.  big deal. that conk will look like an empty shell next to my entry.&nbsp. and finally, we have junior wetworth's invention, the snoozemaker deluxe 2000. this machine will instantly make hostile intruders sucome to sleep. and the winner is... allstar seaworthy.&nbsp. *laughs* better luck next year, guys, i gues i'm just a allstar seaworthy.. hey. *swims over to corky* how come my snoozemaker didn't win. well, junior, it's a little too fantastic. here, allow me to demonstrate. *turns it on*&nbsp.  you see, junior, your machine is uncontrollable. it works against everybody, not just the enemy. better luck next year, eh, my friend.&nbsp. yeah, i guess so. *watches from the window* ooh, that snoozemaker would make the snorks sitting ducks for bigweed's chop machine. *watches him leave* if i can get it, he'll be so impressed with me.&nbsp. *swims home in anguish* nobody appreciates me. i guess i'm just ahead of my time.&nbsp. oh, perfect. i've got him all alone. i'll make him an offer he can't refuse. *swims over to him* gee, that snoozemaker of your's must be a pain to keep lugging around.&nbsp. what's it to you. well, i could take it off your hands for you. oh, i could use a good snooze.&nbsp. well, it's sure not doing me any good. still, i'd want to get something for it.&nbsp. i've got jsut the thing you might like. *takes out goop gun from her jacket* my very own, exclusive invention the goop gun, check it out. *drops vase* broken vase, right. wrong. watch. *uses it, and it seals it back to its original form*&nbsp. gee, that's amazing.&nbsp. then we have a deal.&nbsp. well... come on, kid, go for it. after all, this goop gun is worth more than 3,000 clams.&nbsp. wow, 3,000 clams, i uh, that's all. oh well. i suppose so.&nbsp. &nbsp.*trades inventions with him* good decision. *then leaves* what a sucker i just made the deal of the century. what a sucker this is great. <transition> *returns to lair* oh boy, oh boy, i can hardly wait to see the expression on bigweed's face when i show him this. get those choppers good and clean, you guys. i want them to look their best when they start to eat up snorkland. sure thing, boss. uh, no problem.&nbsp. bigweed, prepare to be amazed by my increddible snoozemaker deluxe 2000. snoozemaker, you say. big deal. *laughs* i can feel myself nodding off, already. you think so. well then watch this. *tests it out*&nbsp. hey. you left a dirty spot on your tooth. i did not, my tooth is a clean as a whistle. oh yeah. well,   that's great, lil seaweed. you can use your snoozemaker to immobilize the snorks, while i use my chop machine to gobble them up.&nbsp. you said it, bigweed, i'm with you. that nod up, and let's move on out. *leave* that looks good, allstar. just a little mroe to the left.&nbsp. a little to the left. you got it. *fixes his machine* here, corky, see if you can hear anything now. *hands him headphones* hey everyone, look at my great goop gun. quit fooling around down there, junior. can't you see we're doing serious work.&nbsp. well, excuse me. well, can you hear anything. *beeps* yes, yes i can. what is it. &nbsp. i can hear... yeah. the ocean. no, aside from that. yes, i hear bigweed. he's riding some kind of machine. sounds like, "clockitaclockitaclockita," like teeth. oh congradulations, allstar, your system works. now let's go stop bigweed. this is another job for *horn* the snork patrol.&nbsp. nuts. this is really not my day. *arrives on chop machine* we'll be in a snorkland in a minute.&nbsp. yeah, and won't those silly snorks be surprised to see us coming. stop attacking, bigweed, or else. look, it's corky's sub. yeah, let's chop it. *attempts to do so* or else, what.&nbsp. hault that firnal machine, you vollets, and you shall be spared my wrath. i shall not allow you to rpoceed beyond this point. well yeah. you and who's army.&nbsp.  hahaha, that silly gadget won't work on me. the snork patrol never *falls asleeps* &nbsp. maybe i'll save the town later. *falls aslepp* i think i'll take a little nap.&nbsp.  at last, a chance to save the day. *takes out goop gun* this'll slow you down. hahah. one more snork for the hopper. oh no, he's got my goop gun. huh. what did you say. *uses goop gun on the chop machine* ha. take that. and that. what did he say.&nbsp.  it's incredible. a snork finally came up with a weapon that actually worked against me. i'm impressed. well, actually, he didn't come up with that weapon. i gave it to him. that was my goop gun, the same one you didn't think was any good.&nbsp. *stop* you gave the snorks a weapon to defeat me.. uh, oh. why i oughta *he goes after her*  congratulations, junior. where did you come up with the idea for the goop gun. i didn't. i traded my snoozemaker for it the snoozemaker you said wouldn't work, ha. *angry* what. you mean you gave the snoozemaker to the enemies of snorkland so they could attack us. well, i, uh, kinda.&nbsp.  boy, this just isn't my week.&nbsp.   )
