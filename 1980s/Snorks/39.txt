 ooh, a tainted night out for fish or *a snork bumps into him* or a snork. *takes out pocketwatch* 9:00 in the morning daytime. and it's black as night. this is really scary.  i think we're heading in the right direction. we should be getting closer to schoolhouse soon. i hope so this is icky poo. *all bump into a building and fall down* points towards light* look, here comes a bus. we can get a ride home.&nbsp. &nbsp.oh dear, i hope so. *gasps* do you see what i see. i do, and i'd rather not see it.  get your high tech candles, only two clams each. get 'em now. it's a closeout sale. friends don't sell candles to friends. they certainly don't they give candles to them. get them.. these are for sale. if you want candles, meet me at my treehouse, and you can melt your own.  too bad this is my last wick i could've made a fortune. junior, forget it. candles won't bring back our daylight. no way. in fact, if i can find my way, i'm going to gallio's house. *all swim out with her* yeah, me too. m coming, wait up.&nbsp.  ooh, this is terrible. we face the worst calamity snorkland has ever encountered.&nbsp. *mumble in agreement* gentlemen, we must use our emergency fund. we must call gallio now. *dials his number on the phone* hello gallio, the governor here. n the other line in his lab* you're calling about our power problem.&nbsp. right, can you help us. governor, i've already tried several experiments lightning bugs and glowworms, but i, i'm, i'm sorry, i've failed. there's nothing i can, i can, well, well perhaps, let me think. *hangs up*  think we're going in the wrong direction. *turns another way* jojo, tooter, come back here. you'll get lost. oh, who are you kidding, casey, we're lost now. yes, but at least we're all lost together. *all go after them* where's junior with his candle light. with a candle in his snork* did someone call.  do you see what i see.&nbsp. uh, i see, it looks like, yikes. it is. we're inside a snorkeater.  allio, you've got to do something. there's no school, no baseball. yes, i know. there's nothing more i can do, but, i guess it's up to you youngsters. go up there, go up and look around. maybe you'll find the cause of our trouble.  uh oh. but junior returns with his still in his snork*&nbsp. you're just in time, junior. e're going up up there, junior. right, and so are you, junior. you and your snorklight.  where's jojo. *toots* tooter, you come back here. *toots again*&nbsp.  uh oh, uh, what's that. that squishy sound. hey, anybody up here. *it echos* id you hear that. t sounds like junior.  that's not junior. : day will be night, and night will be day. so black that, wow. you ain't seen nothing yet. day will be night, until snorkland belongs to me. i'm the great snork nork, future ruler of all snorkdum.&nbsp.  *as they fall back into town* oh no, we've got to do something, or we're doomed. <transition> *searching through documents* i know i'll find it. it's got to be here someplace. *finds it* oh, let me see. *tosses it aside* oh, that's not it. *jumps in the pile* oh, i know it's here.  i found it. here it is. *reads it* aha, our only real hope. it could work yes, it could. good. whatever it is, because we found terrible trouble up there. it's a monster, and he calls himself snork nork, and he's popping all those black clouds, and he wants to rule snorkland. *breathes heavily* and he has these two dumb little minninorks and it's awful. you oughta see it, gallio. ooh wow. it's really  *closes his mouth with his hand* alright, hold it allstar, stop. i get it. in fact, i've got it. now, here this i, i mean i've seen this there is hope. a real hope for you and all of snorkland. it's in just a few minutes, at the stroke of midnight, a wonderful happening will occur over snorkland. it will exactly be 100 years up to the minute that snorkland will be blessed with the light, and joy, and love by the return of the little morglows. but what's a morglow. reads map* a morglow is a rollypolly beam from above the seventh level levels that are way above the sky. you see, many centuries ago, there were hundreds of little morglows and they visited snorkland every 100 years, bringing with them light, love, friendship, and the warm glow of happiness. but, as time passed, snorks took them for granted. we didn't appreciate them. we ignored them. *all the snork cry* and their glow weakened until only a few returned. and now, only one little morglow is left. *gallio cries too* and it's returning to snorkland, perhaps, *sniffs* for the last time. but how can one little morglow help us. yes, one little thing all by itself. that snork nork's a monster. he controls the skies. nd he's icky poo, with one big eye. toots in agreement* well, the morglow's light brightens the darkest clouds. and they gain strength through friendship you'd be amazed. but, you must protect the little morglow. *points to map* it will come through this vortex by way of the seventh level. how much time do we have. only minutes. if you're going back up there, go now.&nbsp. eaves with them* come on, let's go. *toots* good luck. take care.  so you see, boss. that little morglow is big trouble. big trouble. no way. i'll be big trouble for them. i'm snork nork.  the morglow. he's got the   i want to thank you young snorks for your wonderful effort.  o one can say you didn't try.  we've got to do something, we've jsut got to. well, i could always make more candles. no. we've got to do more than that.&nbsp. oh dear, look. look at that. *morglow struggles to be free*&nbsp. *laughs* now hear this. make me your ruler, and i'll really make your day daylight, that is. and when i rule snorkland, i will release your silly little morglow.&nbsp. *wails while swinging a rope towards the monster* look. look, it's jojo. have no fear. jojo's here. it's a jungle up there, but i'll be back in a flash. *grabs minions* yo're doublenorked. *throw them to the monster, and allstar catches the bottled up morglow* oh, you poor little thing.&nbsp. *toots* yes, tooter, we do love the little morglow. *it's glowing in happiness* we'll get you out. you can do it. ou bet. *all budge to free him* let me help, you little morglow. no, look. look. *they see it trying to bounce itself out of there and glowing* aim the bottle. ome on, morglow.&nbsp. do it now. cork his snork.&nbsp. now.  fire.  no. no. *closes eyes with cape* take it away, not that. no. not the light. *walks away* no. no, take it away.&nbsp. no, snork nork, our daylight is here to stay.&nbsp. *groans* you wait. i'll be back. *flies away* i'll be back. augh then see more morglows form* look. here's the surprise i mentioned before. *all morglows get into their arms* when a morglow finds real friendship, it makes more morglows, and as more morglows grow, they glow more and more, until more morglows glow, and *laughs as one falls into his arms as well* well, you get the idea.&nbsp.   )
