*leaves *thanks, anyway. suffering seashells, what did the little guy do. swipe a bucket of ice stream.. it's not what he did, it's what he is. the owner doesn't want kelphelpers in here scares away

damp. send up the rooterfish, tipper. the lines are stuck. one rooterfish, coming up. i better dump these outside. here, let me help. *they dump it in the trash* wow, you clean all the algae from snorkland. i never knew kelphelpers were so important. and i never knew snorks could be so nice. well we're not all bad. hey, could you show me again how you guys vaccum the algae. it's easy, watch. *sucks it in his mouth, then spits it right back out*&nbsp. that's clamtastic.&nbsp. ah, nothin' to it. *throws clam bucket accidnetlaly onto junior* : hey, watch where you're throwin'. well if it isn't allwet. yuck, what's this.. been hangin' around the wrong side of the reef. this is my friend, fuzzy muzzle. and this is governor wetworth's son, junior. : friend.. but he's a a kelphelper. : and his brother, willie. hi. *tries shaking hands with him, but junior pulls his shirt up* don't touch him, oyster brain. you'll get slime all over ya. : *as fuzzy muzzle sniffs* hey junior, why don't you cork your snork. will not. and you, kelphelper. you're supposed to be working, not talking to snorks all day. no wonder my dad has to oay you lazy slime eaters so much overtime. swims off and cries* grandpa. bye. you bubble brain, he was just showing me how he does his work. don't get your snork bent out of shape, he's only a kelphelper. *crying as grandpa pats his back* told ya, fuzzy. them hose heads is nothin' but trouble for us kelphelpers. uh, present commonly accepted. *they leave* fuzzy, grandpa, wait. m sorry, allstar, but when junior insulted fuzzy muzzle, he insulted all of us.*leaves too, causing junior to spin*&nbsp. hey, you haven't finished the attic yet. ou finish it, fish face. kay, slime ball, i will. *dumps it all on him* junior. reef raff, you'll never work here again. yeah, you tell 'em, mama.  you've finished the governor's mansion already. es, ellie. we're finished forever. that's it, we're foldin' our tents. *all quickly pack up* all aboard, ellie. time to go. but snorkland's our home, grandpa. no more, get up. *they leave* *inside the mansion talking to his dad* don't worry, dad. we snorks can clean up all the algae without a lot of crummy kelphelpers around. well, we'll certainly save the treasury some sandollars. those kelphelpers charged plenty.  don't know why you're so upset about the kelphelpers leaving, allstar. i've never even talked to one in my life. hat's jsut it, casry. they're real nice once you get to knwo them. and now you'll never get the chance.  what in the whirlpool are you doing. we've got school in a half hour. says no* tooter's right. school's been canceled, guys. eah, everybody's on temporary algae clean up. *shows up with a shovel* here, allwet. you're comin' to clean my house. oh, don't tell me.&nbsp. *with paper* yeah, governor's orders. *laughs* <transition>  come on, allstar, jet with it. with dirty suit* elaineyfish, i don't recall buying a suit this color. those are slimedrops, dear. algae got into my closet, too. yeah, well, all that can be done is being done. t's not enough, governor. half the city's been shut down to wrok as clean up crews. but maybe if we apologize to the kelphelpers,  apologize.. me.. grovel to those slimy seaslugs.. not on your snork. *trips over some algae and lands inside a bucket* get all these buckets out of here, now.  that's the snorkland spirit. keep up the good work. good work.. we're not even making a dent. jumpin' jellyfish, i never knew kelphelpers worked so hard.&nbsp. eah, and when are you gonna do something about this algae so i can get back to work. everything that can be done is being done. *throws shovel onto the gorund* and we're doing it. : his son started this whole mess. let's share it with him. *he throws algae at him, and they cheer him on* hey, it's nice seeing you all. but it's time to jet back to the governor's mansion. *still throw algae at him*  dinner is served. oh boy, my favorite seeafood surprise. *but algae falls on top of it* oh no, not algae surprise. d'oh, suffering seashells. *more algae falls on him* i've had it up to my snork with algae. me too. *sneezes the food away because of it*  he algae's not too tasty around here, grandpa. hings were a lot greener in snorkland. m homesick, grandpa. i miss my friend, allstar. and i miss you too, fuzzy muzzle. *they hug* allstar, what are you doing here. believe it or not, the governor sent me. *they come clsoer* he's offered to double your pay if you all come back to snorkland. we'll come back but only if he comes here to apologize in person. *all leave* and that's fish fin final, i mean it.&nbsp.  governor, all this algae has not only brought snorkland to a standstill, but it's bound to attract our fiercest predators the snorkeaters. relax, gallio. as we speak, your nephew is bringing those slimy kelphelpers back. *shows up* the kelphelpers aren't coming back, governor. what.. they want more money, i suppose. ope, they want an apology from you in person. huh. it will be saltless sea before i swim on my belly to those slime slurpers. and i won't change my position. *a snorkeater creeps up behind him* yikes. snorkeaters. shuts all the windows* this place is sworming with snorkeaters. *but they still try breaking in* if the algae is thinned out, the snorkeaters will leave. but we'll need to get the kelphelpers for that. yes, yes yes, junior will go with you. *coughs* what.. no way. we won't jet 50 yards, unless we're snorkeaters. starbright idea* junior, you've given me a starbright idea. but i'll need your mom's new drapes.  this'll never work. come on, junior, it's sink or swim.&nbsp. sees a snorkeater right behind them* he's following us, and he looks hungry.&nbsp. no, he looks lonely.&nbsp.  about ready to sneeze* well, why couldn't he bring flowers instead of algae. *sneezes, revealing their disguise* yiii.... *all swim for it, but then run into a dead end wall* nice work, all wrong. we're trapped. *more coming*&nbsp. after being grabbed* oh you, you don't wanna eat us. we're just thin and bone. *is now put down*&nbsp. *with a basket and a tiny fish in it* do your stuff, tiny. *the fish actually a snorkeatereater opens its big mouth, and a scared snorkeater leaves* fuzzy, you saved us. hat snorkeatereater is your's.. we always carry snorkeatereaters in heavily algaed areas. you are an act of heroism. you saved my snork, son. you are going to get the snorkland metal of honor for this. w, dad, that's disgusting. you know, son, that's politics. now you apologize. *shakes his hand as he looks in the opposite direction* sorry.  *with the same two scoops allstar had in the beginning* thanks, clarence. ow don't forget to come back later. the owner and his family want to meet you in person.  his time, i'm buying, allstar. anything you say, fuzzy. *gets handed her ice stream by ellie* i'm sure glad we got to know you kelphelpers better. me too. i wonder why it took so long. *as fuzzy muzzle hands willie his ice stream and junior already has his* i still say he takes too much time off. unior. uh i mean, how about another kelpsickle, fuzzy muzzle. playing chess with grandpa* your move, grandpa. eady for dinner tonight at our place, governor. flips out* dinner.. oh please, dad, no more algae. i'm allergic to the stuff. don't worry, junior. we're not having kelphelper casserole for dinner. your mom's bringing seafood surprise. seafood surprise.. well what are we waiting for. *grabs willie and fuzzy muzzle* let's jet going... *leaves*   )
