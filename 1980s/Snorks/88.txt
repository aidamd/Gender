anything to eat, we'd better hurry. *he and tooter swim in the kitchen*  *toots to dimmy that's a lot of food he's got* d hate to see good food go to waste. *laughs* but you don't mind it going to your waist. come on, tooter, gotta keep an eye on the shells. *laughs* nobody's gonna steal a bunch of shells, guys, relax. listen, those shells must be worth a fortune, and *sees it* oh no. they're gone. *rants* that's crazy, we were the only snorks in the house. occy, did you see any uh oh. you don't suppose he  buried the shells.. nah. *toots no* occy. *moans* occy, you wouldn't take those

on the cheek*&nbsp. <transition>  *a little worried* sorry, tooter, but we gotta sleep close to the sea shells. okay to turn out the lights. *toots it's okay* good night, guys. night, occy.  okay, polly. now remember what i told you to do.&nbsp. *goes over to occy* hey noodle arms, wake up. hey, icky. icky, icky, icky, icky, icky... *as he growls and chases it around, he switches the house numbers, and occy tries placing them back where they originally were, thus mixing them up* *laughs* it worked like a charm now for the sea shells. *he and willie break in as they sleep* i don't like this, junior. it feels like stealing. *as he takes some shells and places it in a bag* no, we're just playing a joke on allwet. oh, a joke. hahaha.  that dumb polly, he's leading occy this way. inside, quick. *occy chases after polly* occy, stop that howling. come back here this minute. get in that house, you bad boy. *he does so and they fall back asleep*  *barks as he sees the shells are gone again* huh. oh no, the shells. they're gone. : occy, put 'em back. *growls* easy, occy. occy wouldn't make the same mistake twice, dimmy. we've been hit by burglers. okay, tooter, you and occy
