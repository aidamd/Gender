 take care of the snork sub, and it will take care of you. fire it up, casey. roger wilcode, corky.&nbsp.  perfect. this time, we'll pass the smog check for sure.&nbsp. *comes out of a cave with a golden fleece in his hands* look what gallio gave me. sub seat covers a token of esteem for those who protect and serve.&nbsp. not this time, corky. *pulls it open* it's the fabled golden fleece. it tells all about ancient greek snorks. listen to this. there was this famous snorkelope, who wove this grass beach towel every day. *view picture as daffney looks at it in wonderment* but she didn't wanna marry this guy who was waiting for the towel. *view daffney unraveling the towel* so she unraveled it every night. *view helen of snork lee, before revealing herself to be casey* then there was this helen of snork lee, the most beautiful snork ever. *allstar and junior, dressed as trojan warriors, fight for her affection* the gladiators wrestled to be her date for the greek prom. *allstar wins, and so casey walks out with him and holds his hand* oh, here's one irene the siren was this cruel seanip, who protected the sunken treasures of snorklantis.  continuing as a picture of irene is revealed* she sang this song to get the ships to crash on the reef of no return, and then she's steal their treasures. now that's my kind of myth. hmm, very intersting, allstar. but those are just stories, and i need seat covers. *leaves* ey, this is great stuff. it really happened didn't it, guys. only in the comics, allstar. *she leaves with the others*&nbsp. there's a map, and we could go there. we could become great myths and mythsters. *they get on corky's sub and leave* oh, you go ahead. but i'll use this seat cover. i mean map and find this place. nothing can stop me. i'll discover all the treasures just like snorklisios, the adventurer. *leaves as some of the fleece's pieces fall off* pops out from hiding behind the bushes* and i'll keep all the treasures for myself, just like irene, the siren. *giggles*&nbsp.  whoa, look at all this stuff. i think i'm onto something.&nbsp.  anyway, then there was this greek snork girl who wrote all the map to this treasure island. we're gonna hear a loud siren, and then i'll be the queen of rich ships and treasure and stuff.&nbsp. wish you'd take notes. ook. ancient junk. the little hornhead is onto something. eh, it's all greek to me. exactly.  eureka. i found it. that's the siren. this is the reef of no return. *he gulps at the sight of more abandoned stuff before being spotted by large jellyfish* ghosts. gggreek ghosts. *runs away* now i know why they call it the *gets grabed on with both legs* reef of no return. *they look at him and want him to follow them, and he does so* when in a greek reef, do as the greek jellyfish do.&nbsp.  the bubble fills up* hey allstar, you should see what's *then it pops*&nbsp. llstar's gone. missing in action. icks up a piece of the fleece* golden fleece, and torn seaweed.&nbsp. y seat cover.&nbsp. *takes out his magnifying glass and looks at it* evidently evidence. *looks at corky through it*&nbsp. e's been eaten by a oneeyed seamonster. corky. ust testing your alertness. i suspect foul seaweed if you catch my drift. *they get in the sub* quick while the trail is fresh.&nbsp. you two stay here and warn the others. snork patrol to the rescue. follow that fleece.&nbsp.  *to the jellyfish* thanks, guys.&nbsp. watching* quick, he's getting away. do what i do.  h, there must be an easier way. i wish you'd take notes.&nbsp. *escpaes* i have a plan. we'll disguise ourselves as jellyfish and follow him. uh, i have a better plan. you go, and i'll stay here and unwrinkle.&nbsp.  : listen he's following that siren song. *she spins around*&nbsp. how can i hear a siren with all that singing..&nbsp. how do i look as a jellyfish. i think of you more as the peanut butterfish type.&nbsp.  a mere tiptoe through the sea eneminies, two, three, four, dip. *kicks a rock* and it misses the crushing boulders* some welcoming. *reads it* a snork can reach the promiseland like that. this must be the crushing boulders. *picks up a rock and throws it* 2, 3, 4, crush. *it misses* 2, 3, 4, crunch. 2, 3, 4, got it. 2, 3, 4, 2, 3, 4, 2, 3, 4, *escpaes* that siren lady digs her privacy. *reads map* let's see what's next...  turn left, right. just keep picking up that golden fleece. oh, we'll never have enough for my seat cover. left, hard left.&nbsp.  h, now you've done it, casey. we were in hot pursuit of truth, justice, and a snorky seat cover, and you got us lost in this greek junkyard. corky, i think we need to talk. *uses telescope to see them escape, then randomly gets out phone to contact lil seaweed* bigweed to lil seaweed, snork sub approacing the area at 45 degrees on the north bow. which way *moans* are you facing. ugh. wait, now it's at 50 degrees. no, 90 degrees. uh, 40, uh 30, no, oh barnacle buildrat. it's out there somewhere. *behind him* well stop them. *in jellyfish disguise after getting past the ships* be aware of ships that go bump in the night. now, where did that meathead snork go. *sees him* how'd he get past those boulders. he must have rocks in his head.&nbsp. <transition>  ello. any snorks in there. uh, it's only me, allstar, a round, good time snork. i come bearing a great gift. *they chew off of the fleece* whoa. oh, i hope they're vegetarians. or they've better have eaten at a place i've already been. *reads map* i must be right here by this sea serpant plant garden. *they try to eat more of it* get back. you tear my fleeces to pieces. *tears some off* eating time at the zoo. *feeds it to them* chowdown, vegetable brains. *leaves* oh, talk about family feud. phew. made it. *but it bites on his snork* yikes. you're not vegetarians. *more try to eat him* speak. think. uh, roll over. *feeds more of the fleeces to them, and he escapes* graveyard of the gallians, check. but where's irene, the siren.&nbsp. nging in the castle*&nbsp.<i>a brave soul with promotions gold, may have someone i'm waiting for.&nbsp.</i> oly snorks.  <i>or soon great snork and place come towards, for five minute i've been born.&nbsp.</i>*turns on crystal glass ball to see allstar swimming her way*&nbsp. t front door* she sounds great. i wish i had something fancy to slip into. *rings doorbell, and falls down into another room* whoa. fancy enough. *he sees lots of silver and then lands in irene's palace into a large pile of gold*&nbsp. you rang. ou sang. ngs again*&nbsp.<i>if you are the chosen one, your cares are over, worries done. but if you do not show the sign,&nbsp.</i>*turns into a vampirelike monster* then rathful vengence will be mine. *hisses* yikes. *slowly backs away* well i can always come back another time. it looks like you're not feeling so good today.&nbsp. tay. *puts him in a dropdown cage*  ow what did that briny bratwarst do to get through these crushing boulders. oh yeah. he just threw a rock, and counted to three. *throws a rock* 1, 2, 3, *the boulders crush her* two and a half. two and threequarters. *moans as she strugglews to break free* two and seveneighths. *takes out phone* bigweed. i need some help. i'm turning into seaweed jam. in a jellyfish outfit. are you there. *a turtlefish with a phone swims by*  this thing's broken again, corky. this time, everything's working. the ocean current is broken. give me the wheel. *he breaks it apart* we're heading right for that cave. what'll we do. change the subject. oo late. the subject is closed. *the "mechanical cave" shuts his mouth, and it was really bigweed trying to trap them* &nbsp. this is more fun than a barrel of sea monkies. *laughs*&nbsp.  here's an old greek expression he who does not bring a gift to my lair has come like a thief to steal something there. *turns back to her normal self* so, what have you got for me, cutie. old and silver, i do not have. but if you ever need any sand now a mosnter again* i warned you. wait, i was only kidding. i've got the golden fleece.&nbsp. back to normal again* ah, you're the one the chosen snork for who i've waited 5,000 years. *releases him from his cage* oh, sorry about the cage. a siren living alone, can't be too careful. now, at last, i can read the final scroll. *copies it on a modern printer and reads it out loud* welcome, glad tidings to the chosen snork. hail, farewell, and bolt the trap door on your way out.&nbsp. wait a minute, we were getting acquainted.&nbsp. well, that's how ancient scrolls go, kid. weakened ones must follow, so you must take a powder. *shows him to the door* you do win a door prize after all, you are the chosen snork.&nbsp. but  some gold dratmus. a genuine replica of snorkis demilo. perhaps a greek earn. what's a greek earn. , about three dratmus a day. *laughs* but seriously, kid, make your choice and hit the road. *turns the hourglass upside down* you've got thrity seconds.  now, how did that nautical knuckwart get through these vicious sea serpant plants. i sure hope they're not vegetarian. *they try to eat her up* yikes. they're vegetarians. talk about security. i feel like a tossed salad. bigweed.&nbsp.  the sands of time have run out. that, or, my egg is done. hurry up, kid. evil lurks without.&nbsp. carries the earn* without what. i don't know, i have to wait another 5,000 years to read the final scroll.&nbsp. *points at her necklace* i'll take this to remind me that a poor snork's dreams about a beautiful siren can come true.&nbsp. gives him her neckalce* you have chosen well, for that is the pearl of wisdom. he who is pure of heart can talk to me through it. *turns the snork of the statue, and another door opens* now hasten and be gone. stop by and see me anytime when evil isn't lurking.&nbsp. *falls down another door again*&nbsp. y the way, your pearl of wisdom also entitles the fairer to three, get acquainted wishes. back to the junkyard, but is easily fooled by lil seaweed dressed as her* irene, has evil stopped lurking.&nbsp. forgot to give you a farewell hug. *pushes him inside a clam and locks him up*&nbsp. you sirens have some funny customs. *gets out pearl of wisdom* irene, i thought we did the jailhouse bit already. why did you lock me up in here. remember the evil i said was lurking. you just got lurked. aybe i should use one of my three wishes to get out of here.&nbsp.  giggles* three wishes. thanks, my tiny tubesteak. i owe you so wisely.&nbsp. {commercial break}  *laughs* this time, the might snork sub will conk out.

swims away* don't forget me, chosen snork. i like your style. oh how could i forget you. you taught a young snork to follow his dreams.&nbsp. blows a kiss at him, which turns into a heart*  so then there was this castle full of treasure, and crushing boulders, and irene well, she wasn't irenen then, she was a rock giant, and the sea serpant warriors had her all tangled up. oxygen deprivation keep him warm. we'll be home soon. ou always did tell the best stories, allstar. *gives him a blanket and puts it around him* y the way, what ever happened to my seat cover.&nbsp.  so chosen snork,
