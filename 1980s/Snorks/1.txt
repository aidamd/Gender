 and this is "don't snork till you've jet enough" by micheel snorkson, number 1 on the snorkland clamstand top 10. so, jet with it. *a fish steals his green wig*  m sure if rick snork will play my friend tooter's record, the kids will love it. *throws it but occy catches it* forget it. he's not playing any record he doesn't know.&nbsp. but all the record needs is a few spins. *barks and tosses it over to the record player* and now here's the latest by *record in* uh, by, by, by, *snaps fingers to totoer's song* tooter, that's you.  : oh, like wow. totally sensational sounds. it's awsomely happening. *writes 85 on chart* i give it an 85. it's got a good beat, and it's easy to jet to.  *smiles after hearing it* the kids love it. what's your name, son. *toots* *translates* tooter. uh, tooter shellby.&nbsp. *with record* and you're sure this is your record. *plays the song, and everyone swims over to him* it's him.  how does it feel to be on top, tooter. *happy*  wow, tooter's concert is the hottest ticket in town.&nbsp. i'll say. the ticket scallops are selling them at our of this reef prices. ticekts, get your tooter shellby tickets here. great seats, only 50 sandollars a piece. that's high wave robbery. i wodner how they get the tickets anyway. how are we doing tonight, guys. oh, i had to ask. how about a clambox lunch before the concert. it's all taken care of, casey. occy's meeting me with a picnic basket. but i hope he gets here before the concert starts.&nbsp.   we want tooter. *all agree with her* told you tooter's not even here yet. now please, jet back to your seats.  *grabs him* just where do you think you're going. oh, excuse me, tooter. tooter, it's him.&nbsp.    and goes out on stage unfortunately, daffney's the only one there, so he takes off her headphones and asks where everyone is) looks around* huh. where'd everybody go. e doesn't have a clue*  last thing i remember is hearing some strange music. we are in deep, deep trouble. trouble.. you're out of your reef. *tries escaping* i'm jettin' out of this creepy cave. *does so, but fails* as i was saying, this is no cave. *knocks on its bone as junior falls back down* we are trapped inside the belly of the predatory piperfish. now he tells me. well how do we escape, uncle gallio. i'm afriad no one has ever escaped from the belly of a piperfish. *laughs as he shows up with a long white beard* you can say that again. and i oughta know been here for 9 months and 20 years. 20 years.. barks*  allstar, casey, where are you. where's anybody.  ep. i was swallowed up over 20 years ago. *they each look at each other* rip van snorkel. of course. don't you remember your old classmate, gallio seaworthy. *laughs* pee wee seaworthy, i'd knew you anywhere. *they hug*&nbsp. how very touching, but some of us would like to get out of here. well, young feller, i've tried for 20 years every which way to get out of here, and it can't be done. says you, old timer. let me try. *tries going up top, but gets knocked down* ugh, your turn. why can't we escape when the fish opens his mouth to eat. sufferin' seashells, i've tried. but everytime he eats, he plays that fishy music that puts you in a trance. : isn't there another way. : well, once long ago, i tried to give this old piperfish a case of indigestion. i blew this enormous blurble, but i just could't make it big enough. *demonstrates* i guess it wasn't much of an idea. *starbright idea in tact with the moving star* wait just a seasecond, i think it's a starbright idea. you couldn't do it alone, but all of us together could give this piperfish a bellyache he'll never forget. oh, that's just a load of hot air. exactly, and it just might work.  okay, snork fans, it's time to get blowing. let's make this a top 10 hit. *all do it as he counts* 1, 2, 3, blow free.  *moans* oh no, that music. i can't.. hold on. *the bubble pops*&nbsp.   ve never heard the piperfish make music like that before. it does sound very familiar. that's because it's tooter. he must be distracting the piperfish. *starbright idea again* now's our chance to really give this fish a bellyache.  we did it. we're out. not all of us, casey.  : we better get going before that piperfish does an encore. *they see him leave town for good* : he won't be swimming around here anymore. he's too pooped to pipe, thanks to tooter. but where is tooter. *barks and finds him hiding in a bush*&nbsp. *moans from exhaustion* it looks like piperfish isn't the only one who's pooped.  yeah, that was some concert, tooter, even if i didn't get to see it.  *cheers and jumps* free, haha, after all these years. i think you'll find snorkland a bit changed, rip, but it's still home. *laughs* oh yeah. now tell me something about our old classmates. whatever happend to stinky wetworth. nobody liked him. they still don't. he's stinky governor wetworth now. *chuckles*  tooter, let's see how your record is selling. agrees when he and allstar get knocked down by mroe adoring fans, but htis time they're after junior* you were just a flash in a clam. *he and anotehr male snork run for it* gee, i, i'm sorry, tooter. akes off his costume and says not to worry about it* well how can you be so happy. points to the fans chasing junior* oh, isn't he totally wet. *gasps* let's get a piece of that coral cape for our souvenir. yeah, awsomely sensational idea. help. get away. mama... see what you mean, tooter. fame is fun, until it catches up with you. smiles to the audience*   )
