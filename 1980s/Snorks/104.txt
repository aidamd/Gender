  tharr she blows. *the baby whales swims up, too* and she's got herself a baby.  suffering searobins. that baby whale's caught up in our fish net.  gee casey, it was sure nice of you to give me a driving lesson.&nbsp. for you, it's a speeding lesson. slow down, daffney. *wants her to slow down*&nbsp. watch out for that school bus. what school bus. hat one. *sees it* eek. pull the break.&nbsp. but it breaks* oops. blow the horn. where is it. here, try this. *daffney uses tooter's snork as a horn* turn the wheel, turn the wheel.&nbsp.  oh boy, this car driving stuff is great. when do i get my second lesson, casey.&nbsp. as soon as i get some life insurance. wonder where they are* i don't know where we are, tooter, but that big old rock doesn't look at all familiar to me.&nbsp. me neither, and you know what's really creepy. i get the distinct impression, that we're being watched. spots a pair of eyes from the net the whale's, and it's moaning at them* hey, that's no rock, it's a whale. *moans some more* and it's caught in a giant net. *comes up with a suggestion*&nbsp. i know we gotta set it free, tooter, but how. leave it to me, guys. *gets into her car and starts driving again*&nbsp. daffney, what are you doing.&nbsp. putting the petal to the metal, and the steam to the net.  you freed him, daffney. what a great manuever. some snorks are just natural born drivers. *wrecks again* unfortunately, i'm not one of them. you're free, mr. whale. you can go home now.&nbsp.   : there, i think i've got it fixed. now we can drive back to town.&nbsp. uh oh, look who's here again.&nbsp. : it's that same whale.&nbsp. thought you were going to go home. *moans for its mommy* what's it saying, tooter.&nbsp. *translates it for them* : oh, he's lost and he can't find his motehr. oh, we gotta help him, he's just a little baby. we'll take the whale with us and find allstar, he'll help us.&nbsp. but we can't bring a whale into snorkland, it's against the law.&nbsp. ooh, you're right, we could get into big trouble which means we'll jsut have to disguise him.&nbsp. disguise a whale.. and i know jsut the way to do it.&nbsp.  i don't think this is gonna work, casey.&nbsp. well, we'll find out soon enough. junior wetworth is headed this way. oh, here comes some of my biggest fans.&nbsp. my biggest fans. and stop repeating what i say. stop repeating what i say. greetings, ladies. good day, tooter. greetings, ladies. good day, tooter. and howdy, giant clump of kelp. giant clump of kelp.. now you're repeating what i say. *asks them* hey, what are you doing with that huge wad of seaweed. <b>uh, w</b>hat huge wad of seaweed. the one you're towing.&nbsp. oh, that huge wad of seaweed. it's, well, um, you see, we're, um,  we're all going on the new seaweed salad diet.&nbsp. that's it. it's the latest craze. nothing but seaweed salad for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. but you've got enough seaweed there to feed a whale. *it moans* but tooter has, uh, a whale of an appetite. his stomach's growling, uh, we better go feed him.&nbsp. see you later, boys. there's something fishy going on around here. *sees a fish for real* very fishy. and i'm gonna get to the bottom of it. *falls off the car and into a pit* the bottom. <transition>  we just have to find that poor baby whale's mom. will you help us, allstar.&nbsp. sure thing. we'll get the silverfish and search for its motehr out beyond the limits.&nbsp. beyond the limits. *tooter faints, so she catches him* can't we search somewhere safer, like, under the beds at my house.&nbsp. ome off it, daffney, there aren't any whales in snorkland. and anyway, it's against the law to let one in.&nbsp. uh, so we've heard. so where did you leave the baby whale.&nbsp. oh, right outside. what..  well, well. the girls took the seaweed to allstar's house.&nbsp. took the seaweed. that allwet's up to something. i better keep an eye on him.&nbsp. keep an eye on him. *sees its eye* a big eye. *swims for it* we've gotta move that thing fast. we've gotta mo  *covers his mouth and they hide in the "seaweed"* f anyone finds out we have a whale in town, we could all go to jail. so, allwet's crime is whale smuggling, aha. aha. now all we need is the evidence. i wonder where he hid the whale. i wonder *it moans and they shake* i wonder if we're going to be eaten.&nbsp.  help, it's a whale. run for your lives. whale attack. help.&nbsp. well, that ends our seaweed salad diet. let's get out of here before junior brings back the entire snork aquamarine corps.&nbsp. come on, tooter. *gets the whale to follow him and his friends*  the silverfish is ready for takeoff. all aboard.  ooter, tell the baby whale to follow us. *does so* i've finally caught allstar with the goods, and he won't get away this time. *he and willie sneak onto the silverfish from the backdoor opening* we have ignition, and blast off. *it leaves* we're on our way.&nbsp. hold it right there. *they turn around to see him* heh, allwet, i hearby place you under citizen's arrest. on what charge. for sheltering a whale inside the snorkland city limits. gotcha, allwet. looks like we've got you, junior. in case you haven't notice, we've just left the city limits.&nbsp. you mean we're we're beyond the limits.. we'll be eaten by monsters. by monsters. *tries escaping* help, somebody. let me out of here. not until we find that baby whale's mother. *uses the controls in the silverfish sounds like a whale, dead ahead.  golly, his mother sure is a grouch.&nbsp. hat's not his mother, it's a killer whale trying to eat him.   where in the salmon hill are we. it must be dry space. *gasps* amazing. amazing.. we're gonna die.  hooray. we made it, all of us. not quite all of us. &nbsp.  oh, the poor little guy. we're sorry, mrs. whale, so terribly sorry. *cries as he lays the flowers next to the baby whale*&nbsp.  he's alive.&nbsp. *cheers in excitement* oh, they're heading home. so let's us do the same, and fast. fast. hear that, daffney. they wanna go fast. ood, 'cause fast is the only way i drive. *starts up controls and drives the silverfish at a very high speed* next stop, snorkland.   )
