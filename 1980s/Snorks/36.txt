that stuff either. say, how about some new wave music, dude. here's the latest from susie and the screaming squid, or maybe you prefer anchovies and the awful urchins. *turns record on, which blasts him out* oh, i change my mind. i'll be back later. thanks. *leaves* chowmaine. *bubblegun again* oh, what terrible music. music.. what am i saying.. that's jsut noise.  who am i kidding. young snorks

just upset about being old. i am not. why, you young peopel. come on, grandpa, you're not old. you jsut need to do some fun things. you think so. sure. barks in agreement with her* look, just be careful. grandpa oughta take it easy.&nbsp. oh junior, don't be such a worry wart. come on, grandpa, we'll help you feel jsut as young as you are. okay, casey. but it won't do any good. sure it will. now let's see, where should we go. hey, how about the snork board court. great idea, let's go. *all leave* i better snork along to make sure nothing happens to the old guy. <transition>  gee, gang

fine. okay, i'll try. *he floats* there you go, grandpa. that's good. well, it's not so bad, once you get the hang of it. in fact, it's kind of fun. *after she does a flip* see. isn't it great. *fails at doing the tricks* oh, take your board back. that's enough for an old guy like me. oh, there's only one thing for me i'll go to the old snorks home.  gee, don't you wanna take your awards and pictures and stuff. nope. they just remind me of how old i am. oh, come on, grandpa, put your clothes back. you don't have to leave. oh yes i do.  uh, one round trip to the old snorks home is 12 clams, sir. here's 6 clams i'm not coming back. *occy pulls on him and cries* oh, for goodness sake. are you sure we can't change your mind, grandpa. nope. aw, sea wizz, grandpa. gets on the train* goodbye, kids. *howls and cries some more* *cries* bye, grandpa, bye. *cries* we'll miss you, grandpa. cries* that's for sure.  stirring up the potion* at last, it's done. almsot ready. *inserts the mixture into four different tubes* that's the end of the last piece of white kelp in the ocean, and it'll be the end of snorktown. *laughs some more, then hands lil seaweed a mask like his* you better put this on. this stuff is nasty. but what does it do. aughs* you'll see. now put on that gas mask, and help me finish these bombs.  this will be the most important campaign i've ever waged against those slippery snorks. and my secret formula, x vapor bombs, will make up victorious. i will drop the bombs into the city, at these strategic points. when the gas takes up that, all you'll have to do is clean up the town. now, any questions. what does it do. *facepalms* ooh.  hello, my name is, uh *snores then wakes up* methul snorkda, but you can call me al. *shakes his hand* pleased to meet you, al. shakes* you're gonna love it here. i should know. great. what do you do for fun. well, i get up and come downstairs for breakfast. and then i nap to lunch. and then after lunch, i nap until dinner. and then it gets good i go to bed. gee, that sounds, uh, great, al. yeah, and *falls asleep some more* hey al, what's the music. *hears it playing, but al's asleep* uh, i guess i'll have to find out for myself. *finds rosie dancing* what's going on here. that's no way to sweep a floor.&nbsp. oh, i'm dancing with this broom because the fuddyduddies in the old room won't dance. say, do you like frank sinorktra music. do i.. may i cut in. *they both start dancing together* my name is, uh, everyone calls me grandpa. hiya, gramps, i'm rosie. you cut a pretty mean rung, rosie. ou're doing pretty well yourself, gramps. i guess not everyone's here as slow as al. oh, don't let him give you the wrong idea. he thinks sleeping is a sports event.  what do you mean 50 cents is too much.. *explains himself* h alright, 49 cents. *tooter ignores him and swims away* 48. 47.. gee, i'm not making near the fortune i expected. in fact, i'm not making any money at all. i better check with grandpa, and see what's wrong with all these people who won't buy for me. hey, i can't check with grandpa he's not here. oh, i wish i knew what to do. hey, nothing's stopping me from going to the old snorks home and asking him.&nbsp.  grandpa, here i come. *gets on the train*  be on the alert. victory is as good as our's. *sees corky in his cub* uh oh, it's the snork patrol. i knew corky would be the first one to try and stop us. but i've got just the thing for him fire. *shoots bomb at him* listen away. *but the bomb only turns corky into a baby* wow, bigweed. it turned everyone into babies. *laughs* now let's get the rest of the town. with the snork patrol call out of the way, they haven't got a chance. *laughs*&nbsp. {commercial break}  wow, what a big fish. yeah. *bombs fall down* what's that noise. *turns them into babies*  *laugh* it worked like a charm. everyone in snorktown is a baby by now. gotta hand it to you. you're a genius. knew it all along.  s all clear to take over the town. there's plenty of tiem before the gas wears off. the town's as good as mine. you mean, good as our's.  *sees the old snorks sleeping* uh oh. i never shoulda let grandpa come here. *meets al* uh excuse me, do you know where i can find my grandfather. he just arrived a few days ago. oh yeah, he's over by the *falls asleep again* hanks.  do you have any 3's. mm, nope. go fish. hi, grandpa. junior, what are you doing here. well, business was a little slow, and, uh, oh grandpa, i really missed you. aw, i'm glad you did, junior. and i need your help. those dumb snorks back in town just don't wanna buy my ice clam cones. i thought you might have some ideas. *chuckles* well, i might. but i usually get a lot of money from my help. tell you what, let's have lunch and you can fill me in. rosie here will join us. rosie, say hello to junior. hello to junior. *laughs*  and i haven't even sold once ice clam cone. you think you could come back and give me a few pointers. even if it's only for a little while. *smiles* well, i might be persuaded to help you out for a little while if you make me your partner. *gulps* partner. you sure drive a hard bargain.&nbsp. yep. well, okay, i guess half of something is better than all of nothing. what do you say, rosie. wanna come with us. h, neato. i haven't been to town in a long time. reat. let's get your stuff and be on our way.  gee, i wonder where everyone has gone. et's get a kelpacola and ask someone. good idea.  three kelpacolas, please. uh, make 'em large.&nbsp. well who would leave a little baby alone in a place like this. something's fishy here. we better check with the police. *all leave* right, grandpa. bye, bye. bye, bye. *giggles*  h no. what's going on. beats me. this looks liek big trouble. we better be extra careful.  someone's coming. hide.  *tries going after him* dad. shh, look. ah, fouie. you've already got bigweed boulevard, bigweed square, bigweed avenue, bigweed place, even bigweed alley. i want just to be lil seaweed street. uh, i don't know. bigweed street has such a nice ring to it. so has lil seaweed street. *jumps* i want, i want it, i want it, i want it, i want it.... *gives it to her* okay, okay, here. places it* thank you. think i'll call city hall the bigweed building. oh, that'll be nice. wow, this is bad. his is too big for us. we need help. yeah, but everyone here is a baby. where are we gonna get help. the only place where there's shoes full of adults. let's go.&nbsp.  my friends, a real emergency is happening, and our senior snorkizens are snorktown's only hope. so let's go. uh, what are you waitin' for. well, we can't help. we're too old. oh, i get it. okay, if you think you're too old, then you stay here. i thought i was too old for anything, but i changed. i'm alive, and might as well act like it. *all mumble* maybe i can't snork the 100 yard dash, but i can do lots of things to have a good time.&nbsp. *takes his hand* me, too. well, it is true. they did change. it sure looks like they're havin' fun. okay, i'm in. *all cheer* with our combined experience, our senior snork patrol will beat the pants off of bigweed and his nasty crew. if they had pants. now let's make a plan. what do we know about snorktown that will help us. everything. we built that town. say al, didn't you build the town hall. by golly, i sure did. did i hear there are still construction passage ways in the walls. eah, but how will that help us. i'll tell ya how. first we, go *whispers the plan to his ear*  these passages go everywhere. yeah, and i think we're just about where we wanna be. *drills and looks to see bigweed and lil seaweed with more bombs*&nbsp. there are just a few more snorks to round up, then snorktown will be mine. are you just about ready, rosie. ust say the word, gramps. the gas will wear off soon, but not soon enough to save snorktown, and there's jsut enough gas to spray once more, and finish the town for good. now, rosie. kay, senior snork patrol, here we go.&nbsp.  what the.. *with gas mask and bombs* bigweed, the jig's up. hey, how did you no. that's the last of the gas, and there's no white kelp to make more. now isn't that just too bad. *catches bomb*&nbsp. nice catch. *throws another, which he fails at catching at* uh oh. *all are now turned into babies* okay, let's take the last of these bombs, and clean up the rest of these yuckyucks. has them in a stroller* i'll deliver these bad babies to bigweed's volcano where they belong. i'll be back in a little while.  eh, the gass should be wearin' off by now. *with baby allstar* gee, i hope so. allstar's a cute baby, but *allstar's back to normal* welcome back, allstar. huh. what happened. laughs* it's a long story, allstar.  oh, these ice clams are delicious, junior. thanks, rosie. boy, grandpa's idea to lower prices sure worked. i sold ice clams for 9 cents instead of 50 cents. grandpa, we sure learned the hard way that we really need you around. well, i learned something too, junior. you're only old if you act old. and you can sure act young, if you're young at heart.  let's celebrate.    )
