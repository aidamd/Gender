forever. *occy hides in one cabinet and pops out of another* hey, how'd he do that. *grabs him and bathes him as he moans* oh, cut it out, you big baby. *finally done* ah, now that wasn't so bad, was

*is dragged yet again when they run into an old lady and her poodlefish* oh boy. there's nothing exciting happening here, either. i guess i'll just never *allstar runs into her, and they mix up a man and his baby* swinging* sometimes it seems like i'm never gonna grow up. by the time i'm big enough to do anything, i'll be too old. *sees the others* uh oh. *all swing around and end up on a tree top, making the catfish smile in content* um, hi casey. uh, hi willie. um, how's things. everything is terrible. you said it, casey. life is unfair. life is unkind. t's boring, too. *smiles* uh, how

every occasion. eah, we know. *all fall down* hey, i thought the snork patrol said you couldn't come into town anymore. yeah, those potions and gadgets you sold caused too much trouble around here. uh, they, um, changed their minds. besides, their problems aren't important your's are. how do you know about our problems. yeah. i have my ways. *gets out shiny white ball* for example, i bet you all'd be interested in having one of these. wow, what is it. *sniffs it* t is a wishing pearl, and it will grant you one wish of your choice. any wish. any wish. wow. how much does it cost. um, that depends on how much you got.&nbsp. *gets out clams* i've got ten clams. gets out clams* i've got six. well imagine that. and these pearls only cost eight clams each. this is your lucky day. alright. great. *gives two clams to him* i'll loan you the two clams, allstar. thanks, casey. i'll pay you back tomorrow when i get my allowance. *as each get their own* wow, look at that. why, what's wrong, son. ve only got two clams. hat's enough. *gives one to him* hey. how come he only has to pay two when we paid eight.. business is business, kid. *growls at him* wait a minute, wait. how do these work. just rub the pearl, and make your wish. it's that simple. *leaves* what a bunch of suckers. people in trouble will buy just about anything. now, to find some more snorks. {commercial break}  to

doesn't mess around. now has a relatively deeper voice* you can say that again. okay, it's my turn. *runs it* i wish i had a life even more exciting than power snork's. *she becoems super casey in her green uniform and cape* huh. well what are these for.&nbsp. *he's a snorkeater who pops out* curses, it's super casey. *occy hides again, and he throws a boulder at her* oh no. aughs but sees her lift it up* huh. wow, the wishing pearl has given me super strength, too. oh, what a relief. that wasn't funny, buster. now hand over those snorks, or else. you'll never catch the masked snorkeater. *leaves* oh, this is clamtastic. it's about time we had some excitement around here. i'll see you and allstar later. i've got some adventuring to do. come back here, you thief. *pops out of hiding and does some light sniffing around* well, what are you gonna wish for. know just the thing. covers his eyes, knowing what his owner's about to wish for* *rubs it* i wish i had a life as good as occy's. *while he still keeps his original body, his posture's like that of an octopupppy, and he barks, which kind of confuses occy at first, but it makes him laugh instead* *laughs as well* haha, very funny. *laughs* i'll see you later, allstar. i've got some rides i wanna ride on. 8he creates a large gust of wind*&nbsp.  m i tall enough now. *scared but hands him his tickets* yes, sssure, go right

and runs off, putting the money back in that woman's purse* boy, being big is better than i thought.  sees buster throwing things and goes over to stop him* let go of those snorks now, you troublemaker.&nbsp. never. no you stay. you can't outsnork super casey. maybe, but if you come an inch closer, i'll have myself a little snack right here and now. okay, but don't say i didn't warn you. *uses her snork power to suck all the snorks out of his grip and back with her* hey. surrender now, snorkeater. never, ever. *tries eating her but it breaks his teeth, so she tickles him* i

doing his* and i don't have to do any more homework, or any more chores. *tooter's doing math and daffney's mowing the front lawn* everyone lese has to work, but not me. not anymore. *sees them* oh, what a nice puppy. *laughs* this is amazing. the wishing pearl made it so that the other snorks think that i'm a dogfish. pats him on the head* there, there, doesn't that feel good. *allstar is delighted by his belly rub* bye, puppy. see you later. what. done already. sees another catfish and chases after it* why not. i might as well give it a try. *they chase it* boy, now i know why dogfish chase catfish this is fun.  get a hold of yourself. you're a bbad guy, and you can hhandle it. ugh, it's just a lot of bad luck all in one day. yeah, that's it. bad luck. nothing to get upset about. *steals money from the back of the candy machine* little kid as big as a house, the biggest snorkeater on earth, it's just a coincidence. yeah, that's it. i can handle this. *allstar and occy rip his pants off as soon as they see him* that does it. i quit. i'm not gonna be a bad guy anymore. i can't, i can't handle it. i'll be a florist, or maybe a hairdresser, anything but not a crook... *swims away screaming for mercy* *he and occy laugh then they continue chasing that catfish* this is the best time i've had in years. am i glad i bought that wishing pearl, or what.&nbsp.  okay, let her rip. oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, i'm finally big enough to go on the big rides. this is so exciting. *but he falls off the rollercoaster and ends up destroying the entire amusement park* well, maybe too big. well, i might be too big for the rides. hey, but i can still go to the scary movies. oh boy. <transition>  h boy. i'm finally big enough to get to see a scary movie. *snorks angrily leave the theater*

get married. whatever you say, cupcake.  now i know why they don't let us little kids see those movies they're scary. gee, maybe being big isn't as great as i thought. i know. i'll go to that snailsman, and by myself another wishing pearl, and change me back to normal.  ou're in trouble now, super casey. laughs* don't make me laugh. remember, you're the one in jail. yeah. well when my brother dinky hears about this, he'll get really mad. and it ain't smart to make dinky angry. trust me. inky.. oh, i think i can handle him. *scary looking snorkeater with multiple teeth finds her and gets buster out of jail* hey, what's the big idea puttin' my little brother in jail, huh.. *gulps* uh, let me guess. you, you must be dinky. yeah, and i ain't happy. *both chase after her* oh, i mean action and excitement is great once and a while, but not all the time. i think it's time i have a little talk with that snailsman again.  h, dogfish catcher. oh, great. and i don't have a license. *they hide behind some garbage cans* that was too close. i think we lost him. *smells something* oh, what's that wonderful smell. *sees it's a restaurant* oh, i'm starved, and this restaurant is just what i need. *barks that it's not a good idea*&nbsp. finds a table and sits in a chair* that's funny. i thought occy was hungry, too. oh boy, i can't wait to take a bite off a big, juicy steak. throws him out* and stay out. no dogfish allowed. no dogs.. oh brother, i forgot. how am i supposed to eat. shows up again* oh, poor puppy. won't anybody feed you. *allstar shakes his head* don't worry, i'll

up* my, my, aren't we the picky eater. what did you expect. steak.. *laughs* now has to shake his head with his foot* oh no. now i've got fleas. maybe having a life as simple as occy's isn't good as i thought. i better go back to the snailsman, and get myself another wishing pearl. i think i've had enough of this dogfish stuff. *as he leaves, occy eats his plate of dogfish food*  or, how about a homeword wead. helps you do your homework twice as fast as usual only used once. *dimmy leaves abruptly* oh well, you can't fool them all. rabs him by the arm* i wanna buy another wishing pearl, and
