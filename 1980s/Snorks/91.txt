powerful, unpredictable *volleyball bounces on head* seaquakes.  did you hear that, allstar. it sounds like someone's in trouble. *they go see it* i'll say. junior wetworth has those catfish cornered. : *kisses the baby catfish* what a cute little baby gill. *hands it a button with his photo on it* when you think of her future, think of me, junior wetworth.&nbsp. junior, you wanna play.&nbsp. :

whrilpool are you doing. practicing to be governor. my dad says you can't get elected unless you kiss a lot of babies.&nbsp. he meant snork babies, junior, not fish. well i'm not taking any chances. *pulls out list* furthermore, when i'm in office, i won't be a pussycat fish. this is my no list. everyone will follow these rules with no exceptions, and i'm adding "no kissing babies" right now, especially fish babies. boy, when the time comes, i know who i'm gonna vote for. me too, whoever's running against junior. can you imagine that little fish kisser becoming governor someday.  : now remember, vote for wetworth, or you'll be in hot water. i mean real hot. *ground shakes* come back here, silly lobster. everyone knows a doorway's the safest spot during a seaquake. too bad the floor isn't.  whew. for a second there, i thought i was in trouble.&nbsp. *looks exactly like daffney* hey. where do you think you're going. daffney, what are you doing in that ridiculous getup. ridiculous.. this happens to be the latest seacop uniform, and my name is officer futura, not daffney.&nbsp. where's your snorking permit, shorty. snorking permit. *laughs* what a great act. did allstar put you guys up to this.&nbsp. *gasps* he said the a word. put on the clam cuffs.&nbsp.  : we're taking you in.  you have no right to remain silent, no shellephone calls, and no lawyers. very funny. what great gag.  what's the charge, officers. he instulted my uniform, and worst of all, he said the a word.&nbsp. ugh, the a word. *slams hammer* i sentence you to 10 years in the snorkland slammer.&nbsp. that's better than a perpetual headache. well, what do you have to say for yourself, son. oy, allstar sure knows how to pull a prank.&nbsp. *gasps* he said it again. 20 years.&nbsp. 20 years for saying "allstar".. ugh, 30 years. *dizzy* will somebody shut that kid up. hey, i can take a joke. go ahead, throw the book at me. allstar, allstar. 40, 50 years.&nbsp.  the joke's gone far enough, daffney, now let me out of here.&nbsp. look, jailbait, you're not getting out for 50 years, and my name's futura. the only daffney i know is my grandmother. now step on it. er grandmother.. has everybody flipped their snork around here. t's the seaquakes. haven't seen currents this bad for 60 years.&nbsp. what are you in for. i voted against the great and all powerful governor, and got 7 years. ha, that's nothing. i got 50 years just for saying "allstar". shh, don't say that name. it's against the law, ya know.&nbsp. ow you tell me. but why. allstar's the governor's greatest enemy, and everything about him is illegal, even his name.&nbsp. : boy, these officers are real grouchs. say, don't i know you.&nbsp. don't think so. my name's casey. pleased to meet ya.&nbsp. oh, same here, case casey.. casey kelp.. now how does a young snork like you know my name. but, but you can't be the casey kelp. why you look 60 years old. well, thanks for the compliment. i just turned 70. 70.. *nearly faints* oh, so that's why all the buildings look so strange. and why i've never seen clamdominiums like those before. my watch. that crazy seaquake must've set me *gulps* 50 years into the future. help, let me out, i wanna go home, help.&nbsp.  okay, you, move out. wait, you're making a horrible mistake. i'm a snork from your past, sent to the future by a freakish whirlpool.&nbsp. uh huh, yeah, sure, that's what they all say.&nbsp. <transition> *ties pufferfish to him* this will keep you from escaping again. says who.. *it bows and he's upside down* i'm getting a snorkache. i demand my rights.&nbsp. you have no rights. now listen here, a wetworth has never gone to jail.  you're a wetworth.&nbsp. : yeah, i can prove it. *shows necklace with a seal on it to them* here's my family seal.&nbsp. he's telling the truth. the governor should hear about this.&nbsp. well, it's about time. *all take him there* i can't wait to tell you water logged governor that this is no way to run a town.&nbsp.  who is it, and it better be important. uh, officer futura from the 3rd seasinct, and we have a prisoner here who claims to be a wetworth, sir.&nbsp. well, he's a faker. throw him in jail. *gasps* i don't believe it. i'm you, i mean, you're me, i mean, we're us. &nbsp. you must be out of your snork. i knew you'd say that, but i am junior wetworth from your past. *pulls out no list* look, i even have the original no list.&nbsp. get in here. *locks door* i'll lock the door.&nbsp. boy, you've got security problems, and i can see why. look at all this loot. you must've raised taxes more than i ever thought i would.&nbsp. *sees the list through magnifying glass* this really looks authentic. but can you prove you're really me. oh, no problem. remember that time i, or uh, we put that electric eel on the teacher's chair. *laughs* are you kidding. uh, i forgot all the fun i used to have as a boy.&nbsp. oh don't worry, you've always got me. i think you're the greatest. *pushes him aside* don't try that phony flattery on me. i know you too well.&nbsp. if that's how you feel, i'm leaving.  governor, the people are revolting. they certainly are. now take this imposter to the slammers. *falls down after being slammed* oh, i can't believe i'm so mean to me. we can't put him in prison. the last seaquake craked the walls and released all of your enemies. they really are revolting.&nbsp. all my enemies. but, but that's the whole town. *presses button and places jetpack on* i'm jetting out of here. i couldn't have said it better myself. wait for me. know a good place to hide around here. there's no place to hide. don't i know you.&nbsp. allstar.. naughty, naughty, governor. you said the a word. : you haven't caught me yet. *runs into another snork* i'm sure we can work this out. hey, no grabbing. the days of you and your no list are over, old junior wetworth.&nbsp. i think that's my cue to jet out of here. *swims away* they're gaining on me. oh, i'm caught between a snork and a hard place. oh, what should i do. *jumps back into whirlpool and heads back to snork*  *throws ball up high* this is game point, allstar. ve got it, i've it. *junior landw on him* boy, that was some return. i'll say. i made it back. nice going, junior. now i'll have to serve it over. i'm starting things over too, casey. *tears up his no list* huh. why are you tearing up your no list. from now on i'll have to treat you future voters nice, or you'll overthrow me when i'm governor.&nbsp. if you're governor, junior. yeah, thank goodness that's a long way off. not as long as you might think. junior, wanna play now. hey, how many times do i have to tell you rhat i uh, oh sure, come on, willie. *drops paper shreds* hey, pick that up, junior. *but junior keeps seeing her as the future officer futura* son't you wanna keep snorkland park clean. why do you think this trash clam's here. okay, okay, officer futura, or daffney, or whatever your name is, don't arrest me, i'll clean it up. *throws it away with his snork then swims away from her*&nbsp. officer futura. arrest him. junior's finally gone off the deep reef.&nbsp.   )
