through a stage.&nbsp.  i'm in terrible trouble, casey. how do i tell mom her necklace was destroyed. oh, it was my fault, allstar. no, it was my fault. trips over tooter to prove that it was his fault* you're right, occy, it was your fault. *moans in despair* oh, go easy on him, allstar. occy meant no harm, anymore than we did.&nbsp. uh yeah, i guess you're right. chows down on some ice cream cones, impressing tooter* *gasps* maybe you can earn money after school, allstar, and buy your mom another necklace. h, i thought of that, but it would take forever. dad says blue coral's worth a fortune. after he hands them their cones* thanks, tooter. how come blue coral costs so much. because it's so rare. dad says the last blue coral mine shut down when he was a kid, and hey, i've got an idea. come on, i'll need you too, tooter.&nbsp. asks what for* we're gonna go see gallio. *excited*&nbsp.  ncle gallio, where does blue coral come from. blue coral.. why, that used to be found in the old, abandoned mine. what do you mean, used to be found. well that old mine has been closed for many years, casey. cave ins, you know too dangerous. gets inside the grapler and panics when it closes on him* ncle gallio, could i borrow the silverfish for a few hours. *occy mopes* well, what do you say, uncle gallio.&nbsp. alright. maybe you can test the grapler while you're out there. uh yeah, maybe i'll do that. tooter, you comin' with me. *gets occy out of the grapler, and occy kisses him back* asey, you wanna be copilot. smiles* uh, sure. <transition>  oh, i've never been this far out west before, allstar. look at thsoe seamounds. oh, it's beautiful. agrees with her* this is the mine where the big coral rush took place a century ago. in those days, hundreds of snorks swummed over these seamounds, prospecting for fresh coral. some of them got lucky and struck it rich, and the richest coral strike of all was at the mine we're headed for the famous old blue number one. wow. i bet that's where your greatgreat grandma's necklace came from. *horn* tooter says he sees soemthing up ahead, just through the kelp. *gasps at the sight ahead of her* look at that. it's an old town. according to my map, that's what's left of coralville. it's a ghost town. ets scared and hides behind tooter* giggles* relax, occy. there aren't really any ghosts there. or snorks, either. that's why it's called a ghost town. *pretends to be ghost to tease occy* alright, you two, stop clowning and look up ahead. we're cruising right through town. here's the kelp beads store, and the seahorse stable. nd the coralville bank. asks where the mine is* he mine. it's just outside of town, tooter. we're almost there.  *cheers* you're right, tooter. that's old blue. oh i don't like the looks of this, allstar. that old mine is falling apart. i'll watch my step, don't worry. how about it, tooter. wanna go with me. *gulps and then says yes*&nbsp. good. wants to come as well* okay, you can come too.  we'll stay with the main shaft, okay. asks a question* i'll go left, you go right. but watch yourself. those old beads look shaky. let's go, occy. *have trouble loking* uh oh. we've hit a dead end, and haven't seen a speck of blue coral. let's go back and find tooter maybe he's had better luck.&nbsp. inds a space and starts prospecting for blue coral* sounds like tooter's found something. come on. *but all the blue coral falls on him* tooter's in trouble. come on, occy, let's start digging. *but coral keeps falling down* occy, look out. we'll never get tooter out this way. we've got to get the silverfish and the grapler out fast.  think we can make it as far as the cave end) well, let's hope the silverfish holds up, or we'll all be trapped here. m just sorry i got you and tooter into this. i see the cave end, dead ahead. *grab some blue coral* now what. ang on.&nbsp.  there he is. and i think he's okay. and look what he found blue coral. eah, it's everywhere. we better get tooter aboard while he's still in one piece. *he enters* you okay, tooter. *yes, he is* then let's get out of here.&nbsp.  here you are, allstar a brand new coral necklace for your mother. whistles* oh, how right you are, tooter. oh, it's gorgeous. nd there's more coral left over, enough for a certain young lady.&nbsp. *mopes* and of course, for certain others, as well. &nbsp. barks in excitement*  so that's what happened to your necklace, mom. it was an accident. i'm sorry. i should've asked your permission fist to borrow it. oh, that's alright, allstar. i was just  but here's a brand new coral necklace to replace it. why, allstar. oh, it's absolutely gorgeous. but you needn't to replace mine it was just costume jewelry. costume jewelry.. you mean, fake.. phony.. that's
