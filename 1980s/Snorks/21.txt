village isn't it worth saving. don't you wanna at least try to save it. you know, i haven't thought of it. that's not a bad idea.&nbsp. come on, we'll help you. *toots* okay, but i think i'm gonna regret this.&nbsp.  we've gotta find out where that drill's coming from.&nbsp.  i should've known humans were behind this. i guess there's nothing we can do then. too bad.&nbsp. nonsense. humans are reasonable. we'll just politely ask them to leave.&nbsp.  move it, you bum, we've got oil to find. but captain mugner, we've been working for weeks without a break.&nbsp. tom, nothing will stop me from finding the perfect palce to drill. now move it.&nbsp. excuse me, sir. wha. who said that. hi, we're snorks, and we'd just want you to know what your drilling is disturbing one of our villages.&nbsp. *wipes eyes* i must be working too hard. you guys can't possibly be real. we are too real. and the sooner you move your drilling, the sooner we can fix your village, okay. thanks.&nbsp. i'm not moving my driling for any snarks, or snorks, or whatever you are. i gotta job to do, so get off my ship. *blows them away*  oh, uh, who were you talking to, boss. none of your business, now get back to work.&nbsp. ho does that guy think he is. *toots in agreement* oh he's in charge, and he seems to be in a very bad mood.&nbsp. well i don't care. he can't push us around like that. yeah.&nbsp. we've got to stop him from destroying the snork pole. *toots in agreement* and stop him now.  rats. oh, i guess it's time for your lunch break. alright, go ahead.  okay, that's it. lunch is over. back to work.  oh, we have to talk to the boss about these 10 second lunches, sheesh.&nbsp.  oh no, you guys, there's a human in there.&nbsp. johnson, if i catch you sleeping again,

you better stay here. i'll be right back. come on, jsut a little more, and we'll break the drill.&nbsp. you'll do it. oh, no, we're not.  don't worry, guys, i've got another idea. <transition> now's our chance, come on.&nbsp. *uses sworfish to cut it off* i think we're gonna make it.&nbsp.  cut it out, you guys.&nbsp. well, they won't get the best of us. i've got another plan. it better not be icky as your plast plan.&nbsp.  okay, be sure to tie it tightly, tooter.&nbsp. *ties it to rock*&nbsp. there, that should hold.&nbsp. there, let's move. *ties it to pole* quickly, before the drill starts up again.&nbsp. clamtastic, it's working.&nbsp.  hey, the drill's busted. we've gotta pull it up and make repairs.&nbsp. oh we don't have time to pull up the drill. i'm going in after it.&nbsp. oh, can i go too. yeah, me too. hey, i wanna help *in scuba gear* i'm doing it myself. now get back to work. *descends into the water and sees rocks near drill* oh, so that's the trouble. i should've know it was those little troublemakers again.&nbsp. listen to us. we live here. you've gotta drill somewhere else.&nbsp. you want me to lose my job. you're slowing me down, so get lost. ugh, it's not been my day. alright, the boulder's are clear. now start the drill. ay yay, sir.&nbsp.  i'll stick around for a while, and make sure those pests don't try anythign else.&nbsp. sorry, esky, we tried everything we could.&nbsp. wait, you've got to turn off the drill.&nbsp. yeah, yeah, save your breath. nothing can make me shut off that drill.&nbsp. but your air hose is wrapped around it.&nbsp. *sees it for himself* my air hose.. oh no. *gets caught and cut off with water going in his tank* uh oh.&nbsp. got it. hold on, i'm coming. *tooter gets clam to tighten it* thanks, tooter. this clam is just what i needed.&nbsp. that's the way it always is. i do all of the work and get none of the credit.&nbsp. you saved me after i was gonna destroy your town. no one's ever been this nice to me before.&nbsp. but why have you been destroying our village. ah, to get the oil, what else. are you serious. i know an underground cavern that's just filled with that junk. it's right over that ridge.&nbsp. n that case, there's no need to continue drilling in your town. from now on, we'll stay clear of the area. ugh, i still don't believe any of this.&nbsp.  stop drilling. we're moving to another location.&nbsp. why, boss. what made you change your mind.&nbsp. don't ask, alright, just don't ask. okay, okay, take it easy, boss.&nbsp.  by the way, why were you visiting the snork pole anyway. to have a relaxing vacation.&nbsp. now it looks like we're gonna need another vacation to recover from this one.&nbsp. *agrees*    )
