 *laughs* i'll get him once and for all. laughs* this'll put my brother gallio out of commission for a long time. finneas, rev up the, eh *finneas whispers to him* right. rev up the freezerator. *laughs as it's turned on*  certainly appreciate your coming over to help me, tooter.&nbsp. *toots* ays he came too* *laughs* yes, you too, occy. spins around* oh, with this new reflector lense, i ought to be able to see twice as far as before. alright, let's move it by the window.  little more to the left, tooter. *occy sees himself in the mirror, growls, and leaves* that's the spot. let's see what's out there today. &nbsp. &nbsp.ready, aim, uh, uh  fire. oh yes, hire. oh no. *turns on machine, releasign a target* dr. strangesnork: that'll fix him. *but it reflects back and hits him, turning into ice* oh. huh. *finneas laughs* that does it. me, and uh, what's his name, are going to have it out here and now. y goodness. the view is so clear, and huh. *strangesnork flies to him* i've never seen a fish like that before. uh oh.&nbsp.  sks if he's okay* , i'm not okay. now come out, uh  allio. yes. come out, gallio, and face me like a snork. *toots* i see it's not a fish it's my brother, strangesnork. the ice cubs threw me off for a minute.&nbsp. dr. strangensork: *jumps* i've had it. you've always made my life miserable. you've always tried to beat me at everything. you're always trying to steal my ideas. mom always likeed you best you always got the biggest piece of dessert.&nbsp. why, that's not true. oh yeah.. what about, eh, what about, eh... *points to 1st place science fair ribbon* there. that was the start of you always trying to outdo me. what about having you won that science fair by stealing my idea.. hat.. it didn't happen that way. oh, yes it did. i remember exactly how it was. h you do, do you. yeah. it was when we were in, in, that learning palce. *finenas whispers school* oh, yes. that's it, school. when were in school, and i was such a nice child. *the scene cuts to a classroom featuring his younger self showing off his lab work* all the other children idolized me. they would beg me to play with them,. but i was always too busy working on my inventions. d love to my friends. *they cheer* but i must work to perfect my great goofy glue. *all disappointed* i'd like to play with them, but my work is too important.&nbsp. allio, on the other snork, was lzy and good for nothing.  oh please come home, borther dear. mother and father are so worried. pelase enter the sceince fair with me. ah, i got other things to do.&nbsp. alas, i failed. come, finneas. nah, fouey on 'em.  en, on the night before the science fair,... hat a chimp. i'll win with his own invention. *laughs* sleep tight, sucker. *laughs*&nbsp.  and the rest is history. gallio stole the, uh, the eh, uh, *finneas whispers* yeah, he stole the glue i worked so hard to perfect. he got the prize, and i was a shattered snork. *cries* it took me years to recover, and i was never the same. oh strangesnork, can't you remember anything right.. the way i remember it was *the scene ripples to a young gallio studying in the library and a young strangesnork causing trouble* growing up, i was shy, but even though my brother was a troublemaker, i really looked up to him. in fact, the only reason i entered the sceince fair was to be like my brother.  hey strangesnork, what a wonderful machine. yeah, yeah. i just know you'll win with your sizealizer. you bet i'll win. no one's got a chance against my precision work. *hits finger with hammer* ow. , i wish i was a great inventor like you. oh, forget it. you'll always be, uh, *picture* oh, that's right, a blimp.&nbsp. on't you mean a whimp. oh yeah. that's what you'll always be a whimp. *laughs* cries* <transition>  i really wanted to earn my brother's respect. so i went to work on something anything that might get me into the science fair. makes the glue* gee, won't strangesnork be proud of me for this sticky stuff. it's nowhere as good as his sizealizer, but at least it'll get me into the science fair. *tests it out with a stick onto a wall* i'll show strangesnork what i've made then he'll see i'm not a whimp. *visits him* strangensork, look what i've made. it's something that's sticky underwater, and i call it "glue." yeah, glue. i'm gonna enter the science fair with it, isn't that neat. boy, jsut liek a whimp, you stole my idea of entering the, uh, science fair, right. but i don't care, ha. that's such a dumb idea. something that's sticky udnerwater, it's no good. it's, uh, goofy, that's what it is. sheesh, what a dummy. he's right. how could i ever thought i would be good enough to enter the science fair like him. *cries and throws the glue away, but his teacher takes it out) uh, gallio. luckily for me, my science teacher mr. blackshell overheard the whole thing. sniffs* yes. i think you're uh, glue, is it, is a fine idea. you do. ure. i don't know if you'll win with it, but so what, at least you will have tried. oh, i don't know. really. how far do you think tom edisnork would've gotten had he gave up. or, what about sir albert mchuton, or fionardo de fishy. eah, but  go on, gallio. stick with it. *laughs* guess you're right. okay, i'll enter. even if i don't have a chance at winning. that a snork. go get 'em, tigerfish.  nd so, the big day arrived.&nbsp.  yes. it is quite impressive, isn't it. gee, maybe this was a mistake.&nbsp. yes, what is this, strangesnork. t's a sizealizer. it makes things, it makes them, oh yes, it makes things even bigger or smaller. i see, very well done. well, let's see it work. &nbsp.finneas, please flip the uh, that thing.  this is your idea of a joke, strangesnork, it's not very funny. wait, it's just an adjustment. i'm sure i can make it work.  okay, what's thing, young snork. speak up. stutters* well, well, i call it glue, sir. actually, thanks to my brother's suggestion, i'm gonna call it goofy glue. *opens it and smells it* glue, eh. strange name what's it do. ell, not much. it just makes stuff stick together. *demosntrates with two shells* i just put it on here, and they stick together.&nbsp. ere, let me try that. *breaks shell apart because glue is so strong* hmm, pretty impressive. let's just see how strong this glue is. oh,coach musselsnork, would you come here. yes, how may i help you.&nbsp. *places glue on floor with shell* would you kindly pick that up, coach. surely. *attempts it but breaks floor* there you are. most impressive, young snork. yes, so impressive that i see you've easily won first prize at the science fair.  gee whiz.  oh, yeah, that's right. oh, i forgot. so what if that's how you won.. the grand rule was my idea. oh. that's it. that's the last snork. you have so many holes in your memory, you can't even remember your own name let alone what happened at the science fair. &nbsp.oh yeah.. i too can remember my name. it's, it's, it's... oh right. my name is strainer snork. anyway, you cna't fool that the glue wasn't my idea. ha. gallio: oh. actually, tehre is a way to settle this once and for all.&nbsp. oh. what's that. we can go back in my time machine and see exactly what happened. well atually, i just remembered that i have to, eh, go to the dentist. that's right, the dentist. to, eh, get my hair cut. gallio: oh no you don't, strangesnork, you're coming with me. come along tooter, occy you fellows come along and see too. *all enter the machine* then strangesnork can't change the story again. now you remember, strangesnork, don't fool with the past. and don't change anything. who, me. i'd never do that. hmm. *turns it on* now you behave yourself. here we go.  alright, let's find out the truth so you can quit harbording me about it.&nbsp.  oots* es, tooter, it is odd to see strangesnork as a little snork. growls*&nbsp. see. it's just like i said. strangesnork, look what i made. it's soemthing that's sticky underwater. i'm goonna call it, um, glue, yeah, glue. i'm gonna enterr the science fair with it, isn't that neat. ell, it's almost like i said. shh, pay attention. now this time, remmber how this happened. that's such a dumb idea soemthing that's sticky udnerwater. it's no good it's goofy, that's what it is. well, it isn't unusual.&nbsp. gee, what a dummy.&nbsp. *growls* well... he's right. how could i ever thought i was good enough to enter the science fair liek strangesnork. *throws it away and cries* there, see. that's how it was. have you seen enough.&nbsp. *sees mr. blackshell talking to a young gallio* watch this, i've got an idea. this doesn't prove anything. you already stolen my idea by this point in time. take us back a few minutes. don't know what that'll show. but i'll do naything to settle this. *all return to the time machine* this'll be very quick.&nbsp. *to finneas* come on. well this is, heh. uh oh. i'm afraid my brother has tricke me. he could already be in up to no good. toots*&nbsp. i'm afraid that's the sixtyfourth thousand sandollar question. *steps out* where, or should i say, whene is he gone. oh well, come on. *all go out with him*&nbsp. {commercial break}  i'll be talking to you later.&nbsp. huh. just be sure to tell my, eh, your brother how dumb his idea is. *then he visits mr. blackshell*&nbsp. eh, may i help you. quick. the principal has called in an emergency meeting on the other side of town. meeting. but, but  takes him* come on, it's about the, eh, state fair. what's a state fair.  oh, and my brother promised not to change the past. now i see his evil plan. if mr. blackshell's not there to give gallio, uh, me a pepe tlak, i'll never enter the science fair. toots*&nbsp. : my whole life could change. wait right here. *puts on labcoat* lue what a dumb idea. ha. visits his younger self* uh, gallio. *sniffs* who are you. ell my name's gallio, that is, um, i'm a visiting inventor, yeah. your teacher, mr. blackshell, is offended by. i think your glue is a fine idea.&nbsp. ou do. of course. why, it has a lot of uses that you never even thought of. it does. you'll bet it does. but you'll never know unless you enter the sceince fair.&nbsp. gee, i guess i won't. oh. maybe you're right. okay, i'll enter, even if i don't think i'll have a chance at winning.&nbsp. that a snork. you never know you might grow up to be a famous inventor.&nbsp. ell, i don't know about that.  i've got to straighten out that kid so he, that is, so i, win the eh, you know  *moans, then a young finneas sniffs him* you again.. just who are you. don't worry about that now. i'm here to make sure you win the county fair. you mean the sceince fair. eah, that too. now listen to me, you forgot the, eh... the shrinkpile. no, the, eh  he evil fatser. &nbsp.no, you forgot the, eh  he canewton scream. no. you forgot the best way to win is to make sure the other snorks' inventions don't work. sheesh. ey, that is a smart rule. i'll get on it right away. *destroys the other inventions and laughs*&nbsp. aughs* what a good kid.&nbsp.  oh, i don't know. maybe this wasn't such a good idea. it sure doesn't do much.  how's your glump doing. it's glue. i guess it's fine. how's your sizealizer. you'll see, when i win this, eh, *sign* the science fair. i think i'll see how the competition is doing. *laughs* see you in a few minutes. you say the machine takes water and actually separates the salt into this bag. okay, are you reeady to show us how it works. okay, show us. *the girl turns it on, but it takes her instead* somehow, i don't think that's exactly what this machien is supposed to do. *she shakes her head* i don't udnerstand it. that's the seventh project that didn't work right. well, strangesnork, i hope your invention is working better than most of the others here today. i've never seen so many inventions fail at one science fair before.&nbsp. gee, i wonder why. that's too bad. well, very, my invention will grow on you. *laughs*&nbsp.  don't know what you've done. but i bet you've been up to no good. who me. uh, eh why gallio, how could you think such a thing. it wasn't hard. well, it certainly looks impressive. jut what does your device do. it's my sizealizer. it makes things, uh, make things, uh right. it makes things bigger or smaller with a simple pull of the lever. now watch this.&nbsp.  uly amazing. uh, return it to his normal size now. you easily won the science fair prize for such an amazing invention.  uh oh.&nbsp.  this is terribble. gee, maybe this will help. *glues the crab to the floor*&nbsp.  that was soem demonstration, young snork. exactly what do you have there. it's jsut something i put together so i could enter the science fir with my brother. i call it "glue." actually, thanks to my brother who suggested it, i call it "goofy glue." glue, eh. just what exactly does this glue do. it doesn't really do much, except make things stick. i heard about it from the officers. that glue's the most amazing stuff i've ever seen. here, sign this contract. what does this contract mean.&nbsp. hat means i can manufacture and sell your glue, and you can get rich. *signs it* wow, here you go. ongratulations. your goofy glue is probably the best entry we've ever had at the sceince fair. and it looks liek the first place ribbon isn't all you've won today. *police show snorkland hero metal* oh, this is terrible. i've made thigns better for you.&nbsp. let's go, strangesnork. you've caused enough trouble around here for a lifetime.  i hope you've learned your lesson, strangesnork. back. that stupid kid, eh, uh,&nbsp. trangesnork. oh, yeah. that stupid kid, strangensork. *tooter and occy laugh* huh. oh, i'm strangesnork. oh, fouey. *points out the snorkland hero metal on wall* well, strangesnork. thanks to your meddling, i've got a new metal. oh no. i'm afraid that's one thing i won't be able to forget. *storms out of lab*  )
