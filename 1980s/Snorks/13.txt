 i'm not sure if i have time to get a bite to eat, allstar. auntie marina's expecting me. relax, casey. this divethrough snorkinthebox is pretty fast.*to the microphone* two quarter flounder and a large fries, please. swimming right up. *food pops out* cork my snork, that was fast. that'll be threee andollars. anything to drink. just water, thanks. *hands it change* extra soggy, just the way i like 'em. fast food was a good idea, but i can't be late to the theater for auntie's rehearsal. *a crazy wind flies, and so does to food, but occy catches it for her* thanks, occy. oh, that's all we need a storm to ruin auntie's one snork show at the aquatheater. according to my uncle gallio, all this turbulence is the result of hallie's current, making its 75 year appearance.&nbsp. oh i better jet going to help auntie with her costumes. now don't forget, allstar, be there at 8 sharp because you're in charge of the props. right. aquatheater at 8. don't be late. *gunk falls on him, and occy finds another snorklike creature named lucky instead* i'm over here, occy. *occy's now left confused* hey, put me down. *occy runs off* where am i. who are you. how'd i get here. whoa, slow down, you're in snorkland. i'm allstar, and you must've been swept down in hallie's current. *cleans everyone off* where's your other snork. well down here, we only have one snork. laughs* must be twice as hard to rinse yourself off. my name is lucky. *they shake hands* occy licks* oh don't worry, occy's friendly. he's my pet octopus. put her there, and there, and there. *smells food* mm, smells good. *eats through snork* delicious. suffering seasheels, you eat as fast as you talk. *starbelt moves* i have a starbright idea, lucky. let me show you around snorkland, and you can tell me more about where you live. clamtastic idea. let's jet going.  *looks up* snorkland sure is clean. you could eat off the ocean floor here. why do you keep looking up all the time. oh, out in the riverworld, you've gotta watch out because things are always dropping in on us. wow, that sounds neat. *occy runs into him* down here, we just have to watch out for our pets. starts breathing funny* ucky, what's wrong. *still breathing funny* i can't breathe. quick, occy, lend me some hands. we've got to jet lucky to uncle gallio's. he'll know what to do i hope.  *with oxygen tank and water* hold him still, allstar, there's not a moment to lose. lucky for your friend lucky that i had this bottle of salt free water here. obviously, he comes from a world where the aquasphere has no salt. ucky, you sound 100 percent better. this is a temporary solution, allstar. your new friend will have to return to his world very soon. in about two hours, that pathway that brought lucky here will close. if he's not in it, he's stranded in snorkland for 75 years. h no, my poor mom and dad. don't worry, lucky. i'll jet you back in plenty of time. come on.  der please. we're fast, but not that fast. suffering seashells, the current must have moved the pathway since you dropped in.&nbsp. allstar, over there. *current* if we hurry, i can catch it. hallie's current, dead ahead. guess this is where we part company, allstar. i wish i could've stayed longer, my friend. : so long, lucky, and i wish i could've seen your world. wow, life in the fast wave. you better hurry. oodbye. goodbye.  *helps him get there* oh my gosh, oh no, the freshwater transfusion's worn off. lucky, you can't miss that wave. almost there. can't fight the current. <transition>  lucky, are you okay. i can breathe. i'm alright, allstar. i'm home. his is riverworld. life in the fast wave. snorks up.  hat's why we're always looking up, allstar. lucky, where have you been. your mother and i have been worried sea sick over you. t's a long story, dad. this is my friend, allstar. oh, pleased to meet you. what happened to his other snork. it's a long story, dad. i'll tell you later. well, i better jet back to work. snorks up.  my dad's a freshwater traffic controller in charge of ufo's unidentified falling objects.&nbsp. he must work overtime. *coughs* you call this freshwater.. my dad said it was once. *filters pop out of snorks* we didn't have to wear these snork filters. you mean you don't have one. come on, i have a spare at home. lucky, wait. *coughs* don't you think i should be getting back to the pathway. here i go, jetting ahead of myself again. i just thought you wanted to see more of riverworld. i do. *coughs* i have an hour or so. *coughs* besides, this chance won't come again for another 75 years. let's jet going. we have one of the nicest houses in town. it's even got a picture window. mom, i'm home. : *waves at him through the window*  thanks, i need that. but can't you freshwater snorks do anything to stem the tide of sludge. nothing seems to work, except these filters. starbelt moves* wait, i have a starbright idea that just might work. *coughs* and i need all the held *coughs some more* i can get.&nbsp.  asey, you're a great help. now bring me my torch song dress. *gives it to her* coming, auntie marina. that's it, casey. remember, the show must go on, but my costumes go on first. now what about those props. allstar's in charge. he should be here any minute.&nbsp.  see, the filters are filling up fast, but at least they trapped some of the sludge here before it reaches *coughs* your homes down river.&nbsp. h, you're one smart snork, allstar.&nbsp. yeah, we never thought of making giant snork filters. snorks up.  too bad you can't stop things from dropping into riverworld. starbelt moves* hmm, what comes down might go up. *coughs*  8 sharp. time for the curtain to go up. *pulling up curtain* ooh, this is allstar's job. asey, my hat. *hands it to her* casey, my props. oooh, that allstar's gonna get it.  okay, let's get it, and send it back where it came from. *coughs*  his stretch of river's got to be haunted. *drives away* *cheer for allstar* it didn't come back. you did it, allstar. *coughs*&nbsp. allstar, you look sick to your snork. maybe it's his filter. *coughs some more between every sentence* no, it's the aquasphere. no salt. must go home. got to have salt. i'm almost out of time. llstar's been so busy helping us, he forgot about hallie's current. it's his only way home. coughs* it's all up stream. i'll never make it in time. i'm right behidn you, allstar.&nbsp. we're all right behind you. faster, dad, the pathway is speeding. *allstar's now in the current*&nbsp. goodbye, lucky. thanks. goodbye, allstar. maybe someday we'll meet again someday.  thank you from the bottom of my snork. and now for my grand finale. casey, props. ooh, when that allstar shows up, i'm gonna   my dress. my props. my fault.  &nbsp.my goodness, allstar, that was one heck of an entrance and a grand finale. *laughs* allstar seaworthy, do you know how late you are. but casey, it wasn't my fault. i kinda got sucked in. you see, these strange snorks from a different world &nbsp. oh, you expect me to believe that. if you didn't wanna help, you should've just said so. would you two take a bow. we're a hit.  mm, that was good. *tosses it into riverworld* hanks to allstar, we know just what to do with this junk, don't we, dad.  *drives away* oh, this is the last time i go fishing in this river.   )
