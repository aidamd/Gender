 come on, guys, i'll show you how my new snorkerang works. watch. *occy chases after it*  *laughs* occy wants to play fetch. he doesn't have to. when you throw a snorkerang, it comes back to you. *confused, then snorkerang gets him and ties him to a pole* laughs* looks like the snorkerang fetched occy. *gets on snork* you need eyes in the back of your snork to catch this. let me try. *throws it* hey. retty good, huh. uh yeah, maybe too good. *uh oh* watch where you're throwing that thing. sorry, mr. fisher. we better find a more deserted place to throw the snorkerang before it breaks something else. *it gets on his snork* like my snork.  now this is what i call deserted. not to mention creepy. *sees bug eyes* yikes, this place is haunted.&nbsp. *scared as well* yuck, a slimy kelp creature. easy, dimmy, easy. it's just tooter and your big monster is just a tiny bugeyed rockfish. *sees it pop out* see, dimmy, this reef isn't haunted at all. no, but it's a sandsational place to play. correction, allwet. my dad the governor owns this place, so technically you're tresspassing. what does your dad want with this run down reef. he's gonna level it and build ultramodern clamdominiums. you mean people are gonna live in this haunted place. oh dimmy, you're so superstitious. there's no such thing as a *snorkerang gets on his snork* yipes. a flying ghost.  that's just my snorkerang. oh yeah.. when i'll teach it to sneak up behind me. *throws it* ou can't throw away a snorkerang, junior, it always comes back. you were saying, allwet. that's strange, it just disappeared. *they go after it* who you. great groupers. what was that. i don't know. i don't wanna find out.&nbsp. *neither does he*  yike. a, a faceless snork.  out of my way. up wait, please. *cries* with you to play, i just wanted. *throws snorkerang back* sorry i am.  and then this horrible faceless snork came out of the reef, growling at us. ooh, you must've been scared out of your snork. i'll say, especially when the horrible monster came closer, and closer, with huge jaws gaping this wide. *tooter demonstrates it for them* then he lunged at us. oh dimmy, stop exaggerating. he didn't have huge gaping jaws. no, but he does have my snorkerang, and i'm going back to get it.  oh it's so dark in this reef, you can't see the snork in front of your face. we'll never find the snorkerang. *totoer toots* yeah, and what if that spooky snork comes back. he was strange, but i don't believe in ghosts.  seeing is believing. *warns* the faceless snork.  e afraid, don't. friendly i am.  without a face, he'll never find us in here. *looks at all the rockfish* but i have a snorky suspicion we're being watched.&nbsp. *uh oh* found you, my little friends did.&nbsp. *pleads with him* yes, be reasonable, mr. snorkmonster. we just came back for my snorkerang. to you, i bring it. why, he's not a faceless monster. he's just snorking backwards. eb, my name is. play snorkerang, can we now.  ou sure know how to handle a snorkerang, eb. easy it is when behind look. oh, if you lived in town, we could pay snorkerang all the time. oh, live in town, i cannot. huh. why. made fun of me, the other snorks did. long ago. so to the reef i came, with new friends to live. hey made fun of you because you're backwards. es. *cries* different, i am. *hands him a tissue* some snorks sure can be mean. agrees with him* : *hugs tooter* yeah, tooter's different, and everyone likes him. and we like you, too. you're a clamtastic snorkerang player. yeah. hen to my reef you'll come, to play with me often. absolutely, we promise. right, allstar. that won't be an easy promise to keep, casey. i just remembered the governor's gonna tear down the reef to build his clamdominiums.&nbsp. no oh. the sleep will i where. what will you wear.. no, no, "where will he sleep." oh don't worry, eb. *retrieves snorkerang* we'll think of something. <transition> wetworth manor, a planned community of classic clamdominiums. but dad, there's a horrible faceless monster living in the reef. he'll just have to find another reef to haunt. unless of course he wants to rent a clamdominium from me, and it won't be cheap. but then quality never is, and wetworth manor is built to last. *door opens on him* governor wetworth. ooh, did anyone ever teach you to knock before you snork into a room.. orry, governor. you ruined&nbsp.my beautiful model clamdominiums. well actually, that's what we came to see you about. you can't build on the reef because  that's what i've been trying to tell him about the monster. e's not a monster, he's a  i don't care what he is. *pushes them out* i'm going ahead with these clamdominiums. construction starts tomorrow, and that's final.  construction starts tomorrow. do, will i what now. we really tried, eb, but the governor's harder to crack than an oyster. yeah, he wouldn't listen when his own son told him your reef was haunted. *star belt moves* that's it, you've given me a starbright idea. if if junior can't convince the governor the reef is haunted, maybe we can. now here's what we do. *whispers the plan to his friends*  pull those stream shovels over there, and start digging. *a machine flounder does the job* you snork surveyors follow me. be careful, dad. that monster could be anywhere. oh, junior, cork your snork with the bridgewater nonsense.  now over there is where the grand lobby and conference rooms will be, and over there is where a fully equipt health spa will be. *sees eb as a monster pop out behind* what's that over there. oh, that's where the horrible monster will be. a horrible monster.. *they boo him more* now, don't do anything hasty. maybe we can work out a rentfree arrangement. i'll even put you down on a reeftop apartment with an ocean view. *casey's holding strings as she grabs the camera* ooh well, is it a deal. yikes, this place is haunted. i'm jetting out of here. *scares them more* snork for your lives. *bump into cameraman but mosnter seperates them* thanks. you're welcome. yikes. *casey winks at eb* oh, we were lucky to jet out of that haunted cave. *sees more* looks like our luck ran out. this place is twice as haunted.  gang way. dad, are you in trouble. *runs into him, flattening him* sorry i asked. *sees machine grouper after him* oh no. no. wait. stop this lounder thign at once. *laughs* like a charm it worked. you guys were clamtastic.  *laughs* the little fish want to get into the act, too. *they swim off* hey wait, i've got to return those monster suits to snorkland costume rental. worry, don't you. back in, i will. eb, don't go out there, the governor will see you.  next time, watch what your gulping, you good for nothing grouper. *chases them* stop, up wait. stop, you now. hey, you, come here. huh. i want to talk to you.&nbsp. oh uh. up is the jig. found out, i am. by jellyfish, i'm gonna find out who you are. you are a hero, son. me, who. i saw how you risked your snork to chase those monsters out of my reef. put it there. monsters chase. oh. you saved wetworth manor, son, name your reward.&nbsp. well,   the governor's clamdominiums look a lot nicer than those broken models we saw.&nbsp. and wait'll you see the sandsational reeftop apartment the governor gave eb. yeah, complete with caves for his rockfish friends. plenty of room there is for friends new. becuase important are friends. couldn't have said it better myself, eb. now, how about a friendly game of snorkerang. ready, i am.    )
