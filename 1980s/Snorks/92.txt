 what are you all doing here. well you said you needed to see us. huh.. oh, oh yes. *gets out shell* it seems this piece of the kelp planting machine is broken, and without it, the machine won't work. hey, that could mean no more kelpburgers and no more food and no more snorks. then what happens if we can't find a shell that fits. fits what. the kelp machine. uh. oh, right. then we'll have to doo all the planting ourselves. eaves with the others* don't worry, gallio. we'll find your shell.  picks a smaller one up* boy, finding a perfect shell isn't as easy as i thought. with handmirror* well if it's perfecttion you want, just look at me. roll their eyes at him and groan*&nbsp. hey, maybe we'd have better luck if we split into two teams. yeah, we'll make a game of it. nd the winner gets waited on for a week. *then fancies himself doing that*  here's gotta be plenty of round shells over here. and there's one now. *tries lifting a heavy shell* what's wrong with this thing. *takes it off and reveals a crab* huh..&nbsp. sheesh. can't a crab get a little shut eye around here. sorry, mr. crab. we only wanted your shell. eah, sure. and what am i supposed to do.. become shellless.. *takes it from her* not me, toots. oy, what a crab.&nbsp.  this shell looks perfect. aha. huh. what was that. *all growl at them* it's the snorkeaters. *throws rock at them* hurry to the sub. *he and

was all his. *her and daffney laugh*&nbsp.  you can stop now, jojo. *stops and they all get out* whoa, that sure was a close call. wonder where we are. *corky gives him a map* it says here we're in the forgotten sea. and that's more than you've said all day. i've heard these parts are off limits to snorks, and i can see why. *to audience* oh brother, now they're both not talking. boy, what a day. first we were being chased by snorkeaters, and now we're in a place where we shouldn't be, and to snork it all off, no shell. what do you see, cotky. jumping jellyfish. *a giant golden egg in front of them* hey, it looks like some sort of egg. *picks it up, but it falls on him* help, jojo. *jojo gets it off of him* heh. <transition>  *on top of finneas* stand still, you creepy catfish. *finneas groans* i know that goody twosnork brother of mine must be up to something we can steal.&nbsp. hands gallio her shell* this is my last shell, gallio.&nbsp. tests it* hmm, just a little too small. *gets his out of a bag* here, gallio, try this one. it's gotta fit. tests it as well* no, just a tadpool too big, junior.&nbsp.  you can put the egg down, jojo. where'd you find that. n the forgotten sea.&nbsp. forgotten sea..&nbsp. but that's off limits to snorks. ow'd you ever end up there. s a long story. see. i told you, finneas. i knew they'd be up to something.&nbsp. sees it about to hatch* hey look, the egg is moving. only one not hiding* i'm not scared of a stupid egg. get away, junior. scaredy snork. *a giant hand grabs him, and the hand belongs to a prehistoric snork* huh.. *the creature kisses him* help. mama. i'm not your mama, let me down. ey, he's kinda cute. cute.. he's a monster snork. he's not a mama, he's just a baby. *to snorky* aren't you. snorky, snorky. what do you think he is, gallio. *as snork grabs him and sucks his thumb* i think he's hungry. why don't you take him back to snorkland, and get his some food, while i find out exactly what he is. do you see that, finneas. *gets off of him* this could be my chance. whatever that thing is, it's gotta be worth something. *laughs*  oy, can this thing eat. ooking at all the eaten kelp* you're telling me. he's already eaten half our kelpbeds. burps snorky, then is grabbed by him* help, put me down. *bounces around* come on now, cut it out. stop it. put me down.  this book should tell me what he is. *finds it* that's it. he's uh, a snorkasaurus.  a rare and valuable snorkasaurus. *closes book on finneas's tail, causing him to wait* he'll be worth a million clams to the snorkland museum. *dances around with finneas* we'll be rich, rich, rich...  boy, am i beat. yeah, me too. snorky can really wear you out. swims over to them* snorks, snorks. i have some news about snorky. what is it. he's a prehistoric snorkasaurus. *laughs* and probably the only surviving one left. his family andfriends have been extinct for at least one million years.&nbsp. oh, poor snorky. poor snorky.. poor us. not only is that klutzy snork eating us out of kelp at home, but he's practically ruined snorkland. hmm, ooh this is serious. we need that shell now more than ever. come on, we all better go look for one. but what about snorky. *all see him peacefully sleeping* well, we better hurry and get back before he wakes up.&nbsp.  laughs* now's our chance, finneas. *finneas gets excited over the catfish food can* no, you know this is our bait, you cattatonic catfish. beside, you'll have more than enough food when we capture that valuable snorkasaurus. *opens the can, and while snorky is still in a dreamlike state, follows the scent*  hey, where's snorky.&nbsp. gee, i don't know. eh, who cares.. he was just a pain in the snork, anyway.&nbsp. oh no, this is terrible. not only did we not find that shell, but we've lost snorky. *picks up catfish food can* hey, look. what is it. sees can* it's catfish food. huh, that's it. my evil brother must've found out about snorky, and snorknapped him for the fortune he's worth. ortune. did someone say "fortune". come on, we've gotta rescue that poor baby snorkasaurus.  don't worry, finenas. we won't have to put up with him much longer. uh, as soon as the museum, uh, opens tomorrow, the money will be our's, and we'll be all rid of this nusense forever.&nbsp.  gee, i hope snorky's open. *really see it for themselves* t's uh, it's a good thing you're the last of your kind. *snorky throws them to the wall* cause i could never, ever take another one.&nbsp. laughs after tying them up* snorky, snorky. untie me, you nincomsnork. *hears door knocking* oh, who could that be. *bounces to it* don't they know i'm all tied up.. *opens door with his foot* aah..&nbsp.  h no, there's more. *bounces out of his house* i can't take it. i just can't take it.&nbsp.  isses junior, and he smiles for once*  well, now that we got snorky back, what do we do about our other problem. what problem, allstar. the problem with corky. he hasn't said a word all day. *to corky* so what's the story, corky. catfish got your tongue. *a catfish really does pop out of his tongue* well if we don't find that shell soon, we'll be out of food.&nbsp. keeps on eating* : oh no.&nbsp. *finds shell right in front of him* oh, yes. *picks it up and places the other one together* this is it the shell we need. and we've all got snorky to thank. carry snorky and cheer for
