fairy tale. what do you mean. if you say, "i wish i would, i wish i might, live in a fairy tale world tonight," then you and i will trade places. trade places.. oh, that sounds clamtastic. oh, i think

hurt herself. *cash in eyes* besides, that wand could be worth something. wait up.  ooh, what a radical view. too bad junior's not here. he wouldn't believe this castle, and this ballroom is unreal. *inside it* ooh, i'd never seen such splender. look at that chandelir. and those columns. oh, how i wish i could go to a fairy tale ball in here. *dances around and then sees a portrait of the prince*

don't have libraries. *takes her away* i'll just check out this book, and we're outta here.&nbsp. <transition>  *reads sign* entering mother goosefish land. to think i'm really here. i wonder what romantic, exciting character i'll meet first.  mary has a little clam, its shell as white as snow. no matter what poor mary does, the clam won't let her go. *tries pulling the clam off of her* you can't cling to mary's skirts forever. time to grow up and get out of your shell. *it pops off, and mary now has to go find it* well, what's wrong with her. mary's in an awful jam, because she's lost her little clam. all of mary's friends will say, "bring your clam, or we can't play." and thought i was doing her a favor getting her clam off her back. i guess i chipped my nail for nothing. *gasps*

hey fellas, maybe you can help me. perhaps if you dropped me a few times. *boucnes around, annoying the kingsmen* come on. break. get with it. *eventually leave humpty still bouncing around* sheesh, what's wrong with those guys. because i can't break, those poor kingsmen are out of work, and it's all my fault. *cries* boy, this book world sure is weird. i just can't figure out this fairy tale thinking. *ground shakes* junior, what's going on out there.. *more ground shaking and bouncing around*  daffney, are you alright. yes, but that really shook me up. you've got to be more careful. kay, okay, sorry. oh no, i lost pearline.  oh boy. looks like you guys had a real fender bender. uh say, anyone see a dingy dane in a funny looking hat. *all growl at him* hey, take it easy, i hardly know

in. junior, make him let me go. not a chance. she stole those pearls. but the sign said they were giving them away.&nbsp. oh brother. the sign says "super sale give away prices." look, i'm sure it's a mistake. she's from far away, and she's not used to things around here. lets her go* well, okay, seeing as your old man's the governor. but i don't want any more trouble from her, or next time it'll be the last. *gasps* your world is so complicated. i'd give anything if you'd help me. please. nything. uh, okay. then how about your wand. you mean this old thing. it's a deal. here. take it. *junior has it now* so, your father is the governor. uh, what is a governor. is it like a king. eah, well, no. actually, it's more like an emperor. wow, then you must be a prince.  oh look, i wonder who lives in here.  poor old mother hubbard's cubard is bare. her octopup is hungry, but there is no food to spare. come on, you cute little thing, i'll find you something to eat. *takes him*&nbsp.  little jack horner's preparing his thumb, to stick in a pie and pull out a plumb.&nbsp. wait, i need a piece of your pie for a hungry octopuppy. *tug of war over it* don't be so greedy. besides, if you eat this whole pie, you'll get a bellyache. *pie flies and octopup eats it* aw, you poor thing. look how hungry you were. aw come on, jack, you had plenty. now little jack horner is sucking his thumb, cause the pup ate his pie up, including the plumb. and old mother hubbard is feeling quite blue, since her pup has been fed she has nothing to do.&nbsp. what's wrong with you two. would you rather i let the poor pup starve. *pets the octopup* don't you see, daffney. you've mixed everything up, and now no one knows what to do.&nbsp. you fairy tale folks are so set in your ways. i made everything better. let's go back to the beginning, and i'll prove it. *goes off* {commercial break}  ah, kelp sickles one clam. *laughs* okay, let's see what this wand can do. give me two clams. *throws wand onto the ground* you tricked me. this wand is broken. forgot to tell you, it only answers to rhymes. oh, uh, abra cazams, shell out two clams. *they're in his hands now, but the stand leaves* ah nuts, this pokey old wand took two long. wait, i've got an idea. give us kelp sickles two, coral chip will do. *eats one* heh, now we're cookin'.  oooh, those snorks must be very famous. hmm, watch this. junior wetworth's now the rage, put my face on every page. don't you think that's a little much. who asked you, anyway. just do as i say. yes, sir. *does so* ey, look at that, i'm a household face.&nbsp.  when are you gonna show me around, junior. n a minute, i'm busy right now. uh, build me a statue twelve feet tall, and make me admired by one and all. *does so*&nbsp. *swim over to statue* junior wetworth is the best. he's snork and shoulders above the rest. fine thing. i do all the work, and you get all the credit. eah, yeah. give me the biggest palace in the land, and then i'll really take command. okay, but it still won't be as big as your head. big palace now* heh, now this is more like it. hey, what about my tour. oh, all junior cares about are statues and palaces. i feel so left out. maybe he's not such a great guy after all.  : *sitting on his throne* huh, now this is the life. my chest are dripping with jewels, i own every toy known to snorkdum, i've got every ocean by the snork. *answers shellephone* uh, hello. oh, hi gov, how's my old man. clean up my room. forget it, dad. that puny little place would only cramp my style. *hangs up as a butler hands hima big clamburger* ha, a clamburger fit for a king. **is about to eat it* h, forgive me your majesty, but your calender says something about a book report. h, that. give me the best book report that was ever written by a snork. *laughs* you call that a rhyme.. okay, wise guy, how's this. give me an a plus book report, or you'll be banished from my court. ust remember who got you here, bud. *pops out book report* send this to my teacher by special messenger. uh, yes, your majesty. you're taking me to the amusement park, remember. can't you see i have more important things to do. *cries* but you promised. i'm so sick of being couped up in this palace, i sure miss my fairy tale life. *opens book* i wonder how daffney is doing.  once upon a time,  okay, let's run through this from the beginning. you'll see i fixed everything. *gets caught by sign as she leaves* alright, but don't say i didn't warn you.&nbsp. finds mary still searching for her clam* oh mary, don't tell me you're still here. i'm sure your clam can take care of itself. school bell rings* mary's late for an exam, becuase of looking for her clam. since this is against the rule, now she must stay after school. well i still think she's better off without that clam clinging to her skirts. *sees kingsmen reading papers* why are all those kingmen just sitting around like that. he kingsmen still have nothing to do, since humpty got patched with goofy glue. gee, i never knew i would cause this much trouble. poor little jack horner now sits in a corner, he's so bored that he could cry. and the octopup's tummy is feeling quite crummy, becuase he piged out on jack's pie. see daffney. since you changed the story, nobody's happy. ou've got to get this glue off. i want to break like i used to. ou mean you liked falling apart all the time.. sure, it's nice to know what you're doing everyday. eah, maybe for an egg. well we're not eggs. we like it. you folks are unreal. i'm sick of this place. i wanna go back where i came from. help. help. let me out.  junior wetworth stadium. love that name. cries and opens the book* i've just got to get out of here. i know you probably don't wanna switch. are you kidding. i can't wait to get back to the real world. uh. you can't. you heard me. just say the magic words. oh no. the spell won't work without the magic wand, and i gave it to junior. t figures. *inside stadium* we love you, junior, oh yes we do. we love you junior, and we're true blue. this is great. they adore me. *stuff rips off* uh, maybe this isn't so great after all. uh, stop. let go of me. leave me alone. *back in limo* i didn't know it was so terrible to be so famous. you gotta help me. here, take your wand. just make everything go back to normal. i wish i would, i wish i might, live in a fairy tale world tonight.  oh thank goodness that's over. boy, am i ever glad to be home.&nbsp. come on, daffney, let's put this book back where no one will ever find it again.  i didn't turn in my book report.. i got an f.. junior, look what i got. a plus. "daffney, what an imagination." *moans*   )
