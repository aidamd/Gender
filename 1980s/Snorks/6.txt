 do we really have to go in there. it looks pretty icky to me. oh, there's nothing to be afraid of. besides, daff, it's the shortest way to the midnight shallows. ah, how about if i take the longest way and meet you there. come on, daffney, to sooner we get there, the sooner we can try out casey's new telescope. hen what are you waiting for.  ou see, daffney, i knew the kelp forest would be no problem. no problem for you. so, this is the midnight shallows. wow, this place is great. uncle gallio says it's the best spot to cmap out and see the stars.&nbsp.  looks like occy's already seeing stars. let's pitch our tents and set up the telescopes.  now hold that right there, occy. *does so* okay, you can let go now. *occy struggles but works at it* great job, occy. give me eight. *eight is given* yeah, we got ourselves a nice, cozy tent to sleep in. *but the tent falls down on them* of course, there's a lot to be said for just sleeping under the stars.&nbsp. we're supposed to be roughing it, daffney.&nbsp. with a closet full of clothes* i am roughing it. : *rolls her eyes*  is the telescope ready. i think so. *sees through it* and we've got a great night for stargazing.  those stars all look so far away. except for that one. *sees neb* in fact, it looks like it's coming straight for us.  hey, are you alright. *growls at him* *cries*&nbsp. aw, don't cry. we won't hurt you. m not scared of you. i'm just a little shaken by my fall. fall.. you mean from the sky. that's at least a billion miles from here.  what's your name. my real name is nebula, but my friends all call me little neb. i've never been this far from home before. i wonder how i'll get back. *growls and barks at the odler starfish* what's the matter, occy. sniffs for it then gets scared by its appearance* ew, what's that icky thing. packs up casey's telescope* i don't know, and we're not sticking around to find out. come on. come on, little neb, let's get out of here.  it was fun having you spend the night, little neb. do you really think your uncle can help me get back home. oh, if anybody can do it, uncle gallio can.  *reads note* "gone to science convention back in a few days. gallio." oh, i guess i'm stuck here for good. o you're not, i'll bet we can find a way to get you home. too bad the eelevated trains don't stop in your galaxy. maybe we can use some of the junk in this lab. *he and occy try finding some things to use* huh, let's see. rubber chicken. bowling trophy. crayons. *gets scared by occy in a mask* gah. halloween mask.. *observes a rubber band* i've got it. what's that for. well, if a star can shoot down to earth, why can't we shoot one back up. that's a great idea. *then they leave the lab* <transition>  perfect. the top of this hill is a great place for the launch. *mouth waters* not lunch, occy, launch. *embarrassed*  *now on the top of the hill with the others* i can't believe i'm going home. thanks for all your help. we hope you have a good trip. and i hope there's a good movie on this flight. all pull the rubber band* okay, hold on. ready, set, go. *release him* *as they watch him go up* goodbye, little neb. gee, i miss him already. *but he splashes back down* darn, not again. come on. *all go help him again*  kay, my plan's real simple. little neb, you go up there at the top of this stick, and we'll help. come on, everybody. *struggle to do so* hurry it up, already. *casey places him on the stick* okay, good. now everybody grab a hold of the rope, and pull. *all do so* it's working. *spins back down* but then again, maybe not. *all hide in trees* so much for that idea.  don't worry. i'm sure this'll work. ready, puff. ready. *blows up, lifting neb high*&nbsp. goodbye. so long, snorks. *turns blue* sorry, little neb, i can't hold my breath any longer. *deflates, sending neb back down* what do we do now. i've got an idea, and it'll be a blast.&nbsp.  okay, little neb, prepare for blast off. *presses button, and the rocket goes but not neb* oh. wow, look at it go. yeah, we'll never see neb again. uh, hi guys. huh.. aw. *fall over in frustration*  sorry, little neb. i guess we weren't much help after all. oh, that's okay. i just wish i had never fallen, that's all. *sniffs* i guess i'm stuck here forever. *cries and higs him* *hears movement* whwhat was that  snork for it.  oh, here he comes. *all huddle close together* well, you youngsters are too quick for an old fella like me. i've been chasin' after you all day. who are you. i'm the star greeter. i was there to meet little neb last night, but you ran off too soon. we thought you were something icky, but now that we can see you in the daylight, you're not icky at all. how come you're looking for little neb. i'm here to take him to his new home. new home.. but what about my old one. well haven't you ever wondered where starfish come from. they're all stars that fell from the sky. wow, you were once a star just like me. that's right. and you get to be a starfish. hooray. hooray. well, it looks like that fall may be the best thing that ever happened to you, little neb.  isn't it great that little neb lives so close to us. : yeah, now's he just a hop, skip, and a snork away. thanks for your help. and don't forget to come visit me real soon. s now too soon.    )
