 today's field trip assignment is to find a sea creature, and observe its lifestyle. yes, ms. seabottom. *sighs* i'm pooped. while you all do your exploring, i'll rest here. no way, lady. you may be looking for a chair but it's not gonna be on me. *leaves* and remember, class, be sure to all stick together. *as he and the others swim away* stick together, right. you hear that, guys. *tooter leaves* tooter.  there he is. hey tooter, find any interesting fish. *totoer swims away, causing allstar to spin around*&nbsp. how rude. what's his problem. probably that giant anglerfish over there.  giant anglerfish.. *scream and swim away* i knew you'd get us into trouble sooner or later. *moans* look you guys. maybe we can lose that anglerfish behind those mountains. hurry. *all swim inside, unknowing it's a whale* whew, that was close. i hope he doesn't notice us. well, i don't. huh. who does that bully think he is. i'm gonna give him a piece of my mind. *tries to stop her* casey, come back. it'll get a lot more than a piece of your mind. *sees anglerfish again* oh no, we've been spotted.  and stay away. hmm, we showed him. we did. what did we do. who cares. it's the best luck we've had all day.  oh no, we've been swallowed by a whale. yeah, and we thought this was going to be a boring field trip. *finds another fish and chases after it* ther's no hope for that boy.&nbsp. the important thing for us to remember is that we all have to *they leave* stay together. those losers will take out day trying to figure out a way to escape. i've gotta huh.. *sees a treasure chest in a ship* whoa, it's a, it's a, it's a a treasure chest. clamtastic. *goes up to it to collect the money* mine. mine. it's all mine. it's all mine. it's all mine. <transition>  there. i should be out of here in no time. *jumps on plank* no whale's gonna make a prisoner out of me.&nbsp. *tries finding the others* this is ridiculous. we've got to work together to get out of here. *reads a written statement* "jonah was here." hmm, wonder how he got out. *finds daffney filing her nails as she sits on a clam* come on, daffney, we'll never get out of here if we just sit around. you've got to help me find the others. i'm not moving. this clam's the only thing in this whale that's not slimy. *moves her off* yeah, and the reason i'm not slimy is because i don't let icky snorks sit on me. huh. imagine that clam calling me "icky." well, of all the nerve.  hey tooter, wanna help us find the others. oh brother. don't worry, daffney, tooter won't go too far. it's the others i'm worried about.  junior. junior. hey, quit yelling, i'm down here. *see him with the treasure* i'm the richest snork in snorktown. now i can give my dad an allowance. junior, come on. you gotta help us figure out how to get out of here. oh no, i'm not lettin' this treasure out of my sight for anything. but if you don't get outta here, where are you gonna spend your money. good point. now just because i'm going with you, doesn't mean i'm gonna share any of my gold. *to the treasure* i'll be back, my sweet little fortune. *tries catching up to them* hey, wait up.  *he and others find her* casey, we've got to figure out a way to escape. what do you think i'm doing. reading a book.. i'm sure the whale's getting tired. *up there, the whale is sleeping* i sure am. i can barely catch my breath. breath. casey, that's it. maybe we can escape through the whale's blowhole. we've got to get under it. come on. hey, that is a good idea. *she drops the hammerfish* oh man, i need an aspirin.  oh it's too high up. we'll never be able to reach it. there's gotta be something we can do. *now swimming with the fish* i still can't believe tooter's goofing off with that pufferfish. pufferfish. hey. it could carry us to the top of the spout like a balloon. yeah, and we can build a basket to ride it. *grabs some seaweed* we can use this seaweed. ew, seaweed's icky. it may be icky, daffney, but it's the only way for us to get out of here. *pulls some out* alright, if i have to. that little fish is much too small to lift us, it'll never work.  ready when you are. *it blows, but stops* something's wrong. junior, your treasure's making the basket too heavy. we've got to dump it. no way. i'm keeping my gold, no matter what. okay, junior, your choice. either you come with us, or your treasure comes with us. *gulps* is there a third choice. *dumps all the treasure out of junior* sorry, junior, it's the only way. *cries* goodbye, treasure. it was nice while it lasted.  the pufferfish is tiring. let's all use our snork power.  it's working.  now what'll we do. : i knew this was a bad idea, now we'll never get out of here.  brother, what a field trip. all i gotta say is that ms. seabottom better give us an a. yeah, let's untie the pufferfish. *they do so with totoer* thanks for all your help. *is welcomed* *has a little trouble breathing at first, then can finally breath again* no time to waste. we've got work to do. *takes the pufferfish away* junior, now what are you doing. i'm going back to find the whale. i've got a fortune to save. *toots a sentence to the snorks* what did he say. *laughs* he said there's no hope for that boy.   )
