 today started with three hungry slugalugs after us for breakfast. i thought this was as bad as a day could get, but boy, was i wrong. things started to get worse.  hey. *goes up to it* don't think that just because you're twice as big as us, that we're gonna be scared or anything. casey. *grabs her away*&nbsp.   *pops out of clamshell* what can i say, tooter. it's survivial of the sneakiest. *laughs* *growls* everybody, i found a tunnel, hurry. *all sswim in except daffney* hury it up, daffney. i'm not going in there.  what. well it might be slimey or something. oh, brother. *throws her inside and the slugalug slams itsemf to the side of the cave*  wow, this cavern is humongous. let's see if we can find a way out. you shoulda seen the look on your face when that thing came after you.&nbsp. *growls* *sees kelp* well we sure can't swim over it.&nbsp. i say we go through it. i'm not going through there, it's too spooky.&nbsp. you call that spooky. ha. well let's just be safe and snork around it. sounds good to me. get off it, you guys. allwet doesn't know a good shortcut when he sees one. i'm not afraid of a bunch of weeds. ome on, junior, we've got to stick together down here. &nbsp. don't give me that cooperation garbage. down here, it's every snork for himself.  wait, you guys. *moans* don't worry about it, allstar. we can just meet them when they come out the other side. oh, i hope so.  oh, whadda ya know. this cavern is just one big dead end. oh great, we'll never get out of here. we'll just have to go back and face the slugalugs. uh casey, maybe we should look around a little more before &nbsp.  ew, what's that. who cares. quick, hide.  it's working. it hasn't spotted us. oh this is silly, maybe it knows how to get out of here.&nbsp. casey. *covers eyes* oh, i can't watch. excuse me, can you tell us how to get out of this cavern. tell me when it's over. only way in or out is tunnel over there. but that's how we got here, we need to find another one. allstar, allstar, it's friendly. you're kidding. it is good thing you not go in the forest. it bad place. nobody ever come out who go in. *gulps* we have friends in there. not anymroe. well, there's only one thing we can do. what. rescue tooter and junior. oh, this is not my day. so what did mr. green have to say. nothing, really. come on, daffney. we have to go into the forest and rescue &nbsp. i said i wasn't going in there, and i meant it. really, daffney, i've been in weed forests like this before, and i can tell you from experience that they're a piece of kelp.&nbsp. really. nothing slimey or spooky. not a single scary thing. <transition> *screams and jumps in allstar's arms* i thought you said it wasn't scary in here. well, i  *screams some more* *holds giant tooth* a little jumpty, today, daffney. she's a little heavy, too. *daffney glares at him* have you found junior and tooter.&nbsp. no, but i found this the fang of a pufferdragon. you mean those monsters with the weird corks in their backs. oh, i thought they were just fairy tales.&nbsp. well, down here, they must be real. then we've got to find junior and tooter before the pufferdragon finds them first.&nbsp. *off elsewhere* ugh, some shortcut, i'll never find the others.  boy, this is the last time i ever   *sees it* the pufferdragon. tooter and junior could be in danger. *elsewhere* look, you little pipsqueaks, i don't need the two of you slowing me down. get lost.  *warning toot* i've got a much better hiding place than those two losers.  hey. help. i'm too young to be an ordrive.  you guys wanna save me. *remove boulder* i mean, it doesn't make any sense. i've called you all those *tooter grabs him and they escape* gee, uh, thanks for saving me. you guys are okay. i'll thank you later, okay. *they escape some more* the roars are louder. we must be geting closer. look.&nbsp. hey, there they are. boy, are we glad to see you guys. we thought you had *twirls around* wait for me. sees it* yeah, that's a pufferdragon, alright. it's time to go, casey. *grabs her* *she stops him* now wait a minute, allstar. all we have to do is pull the cork out of its blowhole, just like in the old fairy tales.&nbsp. all we have to do is get out of here. *takes her away*  alright, you guys, as long as we stick together, everything will be *runs into tree*&nbsp. oh no, allstar. *hangs onto pufferdragon by accident* where's the breaks. follow me. *all do so* this way.&nbsp. o, not the weeds, go around, go around. look, we're trapped.&nbsp.  we're not afraid, because allstar's gonna pull your cork. cork.. what cork. *sees it* oh, that cork.   well.... it goes all the way through on the way to snorkland to the other side. this chamber isn't a dead end after all.&nbsp.  i think we all learned that working together gets a lot more done than working against each other, right. ooh, ick. what a slimey weed.&nbsp. hey tooter, why don't you put this over your head. it would be a definite improvement. *laughs, but tooter scares him again* hey, what are you trying to do, give me a heart attack.   )
