 so you stay where i can see you, jimmy and don't go out on the dock. okay mom, bye. *plays ball when he drops it in the ocean* uh oh. *goes to dock when he falls over* whoa. help.  f you're gonna stop, corky, at least give us a signal. shh, listen. i think someone's in trouble.&nbsp. help. help. come on. *horn* snork patrol to the rescue.  jimmy, jimmy. *she runs over to him* are you okay. i didn't know you could swim so well. but, but i wasn't swimming. some little sea creatures saved me. didn't you see 'em, ma. : come on, jimmy. i think you may have swallowed a litle too much saltwater. but, but they were real.  &nbsp.another successful rescue. &nbsp.yeah, but his mom didn't even thank us. *sniffs* what's that funy smell.&nbsp. sniffs it* i think it's called fire. look.  looks like this is going to be a busy day for *horn* the snork patrol.&nbsp.  wow, so that's what a fire looks like. i wonder where it came from. i'm sorry. *they all turn to see her, a small flame* it was an accident. *sets off another fire* oh no, not again. *tries to put it out* she's a walkin' flamethrower. *after corky puts it out with his foot* oh, thanks for your help. my name's ember. and i'm corky. it's nice to meet *tries shaking her hand when he gets burned* yaao. sorry, i hope i didn't barbecue your fingers. : hi, i'm casey. : i'm jojo. i hope you don't mind if we skip the handshake. oh, of course not. and who are you. hey, don't get too close to me. you're dangerous. oh, don't mind junior. he's always fired up about something. *laughs* oh, that's okay, so am i. where are you from.&nbsp. i live with the island snorks. hmm, then you're a long way from home. : i know. *cries* the evil ice wizard froze our island.&nbsp. the ice wizard. uh huh. *sniffs* and since my flames were his only threat, *demonstrates* he struck me with an arrow, and shot me off the island.&nbsp. that's terrible. but don't get yourself all burned up. the snork patrol is here. yeah, we'll be glad to help you. what do you ean "we".. don't you wanna help ember get home, junior. why should i. because, it's the nice thing to do. nice, huh. lead the way, ember.  ugh, i think it's time for me to refuel. *she turns cooler* mind if we take a break. mind.. i insist on it. *sits down* ugh, i'm burning up. i think i got a fever. *giggles* no, junior, you're just too close to ember. *eats a few leaves ,the nreturns to normal* what are you doing. eating. i have to keep up my strength, you know. we should be about halfway there. i better check my trusty map. now, where exactly did you say this island was, ember. ll show you, it's right here. *accidentally burns the map* oh, i was just trying to be helpful. yeah, some help. can we go home now. junior, how can you be so cold. eah, don't you wanna help ember get back to her island. hey, my mom won't even let me play with matches. why do you live on that dumb island, anyway. well, when i was just a tiny spark, the island snorks took me in and cared for me, so in return, i stayed and kept things warm for them. until the ice wizard took over. yeah, and he doesn't even care about anything except the golden river. what a dope. what's he want with a bunch of water.. oh, it's not a river of water it's a river of gold. the wixard froze it solid, and he makes the island snorks mine it for him. do you mean gold. as in 14 karot. uh huh. h ember, you just sparked my interest in this island of your's. come on, what are you guys waiting for.. *runs off* i didn't know junior could be so kind and helpful. neither did we.&nbsp.  ow if we can just get you across this river, you'll be home sweet home. looks at rope above him* no problem. *pulls it down* hop aboard. we're jsut about ready for takeoff. hang on, everybody. *they swing across the river* weee. *accidentally burns it* look out. *all run from the flames and go up a tree branch* phew, that was a close one. yeah, but we're okay now.  what's that noise.&nbsp.  : why don't we just swim across this stream.. : well that's great for us, but ember can't get wet. : besides, who would want to swim in this water. it's full of garbage.&nbsp. : eww, yuck. : but as they say, one man's trash is another man's treasure.  : just a little more hot air, ember, and we'll be up, up and away.  hooray, it worked.&nbsp. &nbsp.hey ember, did anyone ever tell you that you're uh, full of hot air. *laughs* *giggles* <transition> *standing around and waiting* hurry up, you guys, we haven't gone all day. whoa, slever down there, junior. let's make sure we're going the right way. no problem. i've already decided we can take a shortcut through this field.&nbsp. hmm, sounds like a good idea. troops, forward march.&nbsp.  what was that.&nbsp. don't know, but we'd better keep moving.  pants* what's happening. eats me. i guess i got a little overheated.&nbsp.  : sorry to be so much trouble, guys. &nbsp.no trouble at all. i just wish we'd brought some butter and salt. *takes a bite out of the popcorn*  with an arrow* here's the arrow i told you about. this is where i landed, when the wizard shot me off the island. *burns that too*&nbsp. wow, i'm never letting you play with my toys. you're too destructive. looks at the bridge* now, if my calculations are correct, the island's not much further.&nbsp. then let's go.  sniffs* hey, i think something's burning, and i don'r mean ember. look. ee flames beneath them* yipes. *run to the other side as quickly as they can before the bridge itself collapses and falls deep into the gorge* sweating* that golden river better be worth all this trouble. well at least we're all safe. besides, what else can happen to us.&nbsp.  don't worry, it's just water. that can't hurt us. well, it may not hurt you, but it'll snuff me out for good.&nbsp. don't worry, i'll save you. *they quickly get her to a cave* there there, ember, we'll be safe until the storm ends. oh, i'm sure glad i met you guys. if anybody can save my island, you can.  *points across the river to a frozen island covered in snow* there it is. that's snork island.&nbsp. well ember, in just a few more minutes, you'll be home.&nbsp. i'm not so sure about that. how am i supposed to get across this water. *with wood* hop on. jojo's taxi service, at your disposal. *she gets on it, and they walk across the river with her* now hang on, ember.&nbsp.  ooh, it looks like that silly little flame just can't stay away form this island. perhaps i should give her and her friends a proper welcome. *laughs and throws an icecicle at them, thus freezing their pathway* aaah... oh no, it's the wizard. what'll we do.. you'll be alright. just don't let go of this branch.&nbsp.  sees she's melting the snow* oh no. i've gotta save my friends. i'll make sure the snorks get a warm reception, no matter what the ice wizard does. *burns a small tree behind her, and warms them with her flame* hooray. now i knwo what a seaweed sicle feels like. oh drat. little miss blowtorch just won't quit. hmm, perhaps it's time to douce that pesky flame once and for all. *laughs* ooh, i like that laugh. *throws anoher icecile at them while ember warms them up some more* gee ember, i always knew you were a warm person, but i never really appreciated it until now. thanks, casey, but i'm beginning to feel a little dim after all that work. i, i think i need to refuel. *turns blue again* : we'll help you find some food, ember. oh thanks, corky. but first, we better get out of here. the ice wizard might attack again. *they skae across with her* ey, this is fun. *twirls around, then falls into snow as the other laugh*&nbsp. sees icecicle collapse into the snow* it's the ice wizard. run.&nbsp.  h no, what now.. come on. *they follow her into an empty house equipped with a fireplace* whew, that was close. eah, but how are we gonna get out of here. i'm supposed to be home in time for dinner. well at the moment, that's the least of our problems. hmm, this little spark needs some kindling. *give her some bark* see how this tastes, ember. hmm, charbroiled oak my favorite. *takes her over to the fireplace* do you feel okay now. yes, but i'll feel even better once we get rid of the ice wizard. well that may be harder than we thought that wizard seems pretty powerful. gasps* maybe the townspeople can help us. um, i don't think they'll be much use to us.&nbsp.  you'll help us fight the ice wizard, won't you. blank stare* but you can't possibly be happy with him ruining your island.&nbsp. another blank stare* with a rock* what's your problem, pal. i bet you'd care if i tried to sell you this rock for 10 clams. *takes out money and gives it to him* i don't care.&nbsp. wow, that guy doesn't care about anything. that's the problem none of them do. you mean all the snorks on the island are this indifferent. uh huh. the ice wizard put a spell on them, turning all their hearts cold. now, they're jsut as unfeeling as he is.&nbsp. couldn't you thaw them out. *gasps* yeah, that's a great idea. *takes them to ember* okay, ember, time to make this fella's blood boil.&nbsp. ats a branch and warms him up*&nbsp. *back to normal* oh, where am i. ember, you've gotta save us. *sighs* it's all i can do. *all the island snorks turn cold again and walk away* i'm sorry, but the spell is too strong. that's okay. *throws more wood for her* we'll take care of that nasty wizard ourselves. *about to open door* : junior, where are you going. uh, i've got a little unfinished business with those island snorks. i'll meet you guys later. *takes out money* boy, if one lousy rock can get me 10 clams, i can make a fortune off these marbles. *leaves* burns down cold door* shall we go. snork patrol, to the castle. {commercial break}  i'm not sure how to get past this gate.&nbsp. let me try. *tries to pull, but it's hard* *takes out hair pin* hey, maybe this will work. *inserts it into keyhole, and it opens* wow.  that door leads to the tower.  just where do you think you're going.. to see the ice wizard, now get out of our way. no, you get out of my way. *sweeps them onto the broom* now i've got you, you little pests. *puts them back down* hey, hit me. i dare ya. okay. *misses* hey, where'd she go she's right behind you. *sees her on broom* uh oh. *melts, leaving only his hat to run off* giggles as entire broom burns* sometimes, i'm just too hot to handle. *burns down door*&nbsp. yay. ooray.&nbsp.  wow. *the temperature rises somehow* ere he is. let's get him. *but they only get a dummy of him* t's a dummy. he tricked us. *pops out from behind* and for another trick, i'll give you the cold shoulder. *laughs as he blows ice on corky, turning him cold* *cornered as she too turns frozen* becomes frozen as well* : *to ember* now, it's your turn, you hottempered little troublemaker. *tries fighting back, but he blows ice on her* you haven't won yet. i'll be back.&nbsp. *throws an icecicle at her but it hits a tree and she jumps down* ha. she won't be back, now that her frinds can't help her.&nbsp. shoes up* hey everybody. look at all the clams i just made.&nbsp. onotonous* we don't care. sees them* whoa, what happened to you guys.. our little playmates were dumb enough to try and catch me.&nbsp. uh, uh don't worry. i, i won't bother you. no, i don't think you will. you're different from your friends.&nbsp. *gulps* yeah, i'm not frozen. well, not yet anyway. and perhaps, you won't have to be. i mean after all, we're a lot alike.&nbsp. *shakes* we are. oh sure. obviously, that money was more important to you than helping your friends. *laughs* i like that. it shows you've got potential.&nbsp. o uh, what are you gonna do with me. well, i could use an assistant. and with a little coaching, you could be as coldhearted as me. *laughs* how about it. takes out a golden jewel* hey, you know. i think i might like being a wizard. *shakes his hand* it's a deal. *the alarm goes off and the temperature only increases in the room, making junior sweat* oh, it's getting hotter in here. not as hot as it's gonna get. you don't wanna be like him, junior. he's mean and cruel. why, he doesn't even have any friends. ha. who needs friends.. looks at his* i do miss mine. well you don't need them. as soon as we get rid of this pesky flame, you can share all my wealth with me. well if you won't help me, junior, then i'll just take care of this myself. *she tries fighting him* so, you want to play rough, eh. here, catch. *throws a snowball at her, cuasing her to melt into a little flame* go on, junior, snuff her out. *gasps* um, me. what are you waiting for. one little stomp on the foot, and you'll be set for life. walks over to his frozen friends* i don't care how much gold you give me. *takes out cash* it won't buy me friends like these. *burns the money, who turns into ember* hanks, junior. now i'm really cookin'. *melts ice wizard* o, let me, aaahhh. *melts away* warms the gang back to normal* you did it, ember.&nbsp. what did she do. ember defeated the ice wizard.&nbsp. thanks to junior's help. unior helped you.. don't believe it.&nbsp. neither do i. how could i burn all that money.. it's because deep down, you're realy warmhearted. blushes* gee, i guess so. but, let's not tell anyone, okay.  &nbsp.thanks again, junior. *comes out with a present* we'd like you to have something to remember us by. &nbsp.oh junior will never forget this place. it's probably the first, and last, time he'll ever burn money. *laughs* you can say that again. well, i guess it was worth it to save you, ember. and because of that unselfish attitude, we want you to have this. opens it and sees it's real gold* wow, gold. *checks with a magnifying glass to be sure it's real* and it's 24 karot. uh, you got anymore money to burn. oh, junior. *laugh*   )
