 good morning, rise and shine, everybody. *moans* oh, casey, it's saturday, we're camping and there's no school. what's the big rush. aven't you guys heard. the early snork catches the worm. *sees junior holding a slug* oh junior, i didn't mean for you to take me literally.&nbsp. this is no worm, casey, this is what the natives call an alarm clock. watch.&nbsp.  *laughs* good morning, tooter. ticks his tongue out at him* *growls at it* i'd never seen a slug like this in snorkland. uncle gallio would go nuts if he could see some of them weird creatures that live down here on the other side of the reef. say, i bet they'd pay to see some of these things in snorkland. maybe we should take some of them back with us.&nbsp. you know, junior, for once you've got a good idea. akes up and yawns* ah, what's all the commotion. allstar and junior finally agreed on something. oh, that's nice. ah, what's for breakfast. *junior shows her the slug* ew, ick. oh, no. that is where i draw the line, i am not eating slugs for breakfast. *others laugh at her*&nbsp.  here, little creatures, come to junior. *finds red ball like creatures* oh boy, they'd never see anything like this in snorkland. *places her in a giant cup* aw, junior, that's not nice. her little friends are going to miss her. you're right. i'll take them, too. *places them in the same cup with her*  allstar, how's this.&nbsp.
