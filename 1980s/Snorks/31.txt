 move it, you twotonned tunner. *it leaves* much better. *laughs* there's our target, finneas snorkland. with my patentant permanent wave machine, i'll flatten the city, and rebuild it in my own image. the image of *forgets until finenas holds a picture of him* of course, finneas, i'd know that face anywhere dr. strangesnork. now back to your paddle wheel, finneas. i need power. *he moves it* more power, that's right. put your tailfin into it. *the giant hand flattens the kelp* now i'll really give snorkland a great big hand. *laughs* we'll soon see how the city sells up to my permanent wave.  spring cleaning in my lab is such a chore. *giggles* i don't wonder the whirlpool what i'd do without you. oh don't mention it, uncle gallio. dimmy, that vaccum snail's getting pretty full.&nbsp. pants* he sure said a mouthful. okay, out you go, *it leaves and another one comes in* and in you go.  aren't you a little late, daffney. you promised to help us with uncle gallio's spring cleaning this morning. sorry, but i just had to get the newest jane flounder poster. i'm getting my hair done just like her's. looks at the poster* it, uh, sure looks different. xactly, dimmy. just look at yourselves. everyone in snorkland dresses exactly the same dull and boring. *all look at themselves, including occy* jane flounder doesn't look like that she has style, she's unique, she's *sees off in distance* what's happening..  something's wrong. snorks are flying, but no buildings are being flattened. faster, finneas, faster. *finenas pants*  with head in cone* i've never felt a current like that before. *out of occy* me neither. pounces on spring on snork when stuck in dirt* alm down, allstar, i've got you. *helps him back up* oh, thanks, casey. i've never had a springloaded snork before. oh, great. now i've got sea depris all over my nice new poster. *sees shiny, magnetic red ball* hey, what's this. hat's what. *daffney takes off his cone and shows it to him* oh, that. it's just an old perpetual power pearl. it was supposidly the greatest source of power in the whole universe. but it never worked why, i *throws it away* i forget why. ooh, can i have it then. can i. certainly. but what in the whirlpool for. *takes off star in hair* oh, it'll make a sansational hair ornament. just like jane fliounder's. pants in exhaustion* don't give up. faster. faster. oh, what's the use.. you're a washout, finneas.&nbsp. budges but can't move* <b>dr. strangesnork:</b>&nbsp.my permanent wave machine works, but you don't. it's times like these, i wish i had a dogfish for an assistant. hold it. i know where i can get the sea power i need. *puts on disguise again* here, we'll put this on so we can sneak into the lab of my brother, uh, what's his name. *finenas whispers it to him* right, gallio. this way, finneas.&nbsp.  but daffney, you just got here.&nbsp. eaves* sorry, i'm late for my weekly jane flounder workout. laughs* i'll just sneak in and grab that power pearl. *daffney passes by* hey, watch your jet, young lady. sorry.&nbsp. *points out power pearl to him* ow, what are you doing.. *he sees her with it* you're right, finneas. she is wearing the perpetual power pearl. *laughs* and my stealing it will be as easy as *forgets until finneas throws a cream pie at him* right, pie. *spy on her out of gournd* there she is, going into that health club. *follow her*  4,002, 4,003,  nothing like a little jetrope to keep in shape, eh, bruno. you know it, daffney. 4,004, *sees strangesnork and kicks him out* sorry, pal, it's ladies day at the gym.&nbsp. ow see here, you musclebound macarole,  and no puny pets either. *screeches as he's thrown out* <transition>  this is advanced aquarobics, girls. work those snorks. now, you're jetting it. up, down, up, down, keep those snorks on the ground.  *sees daffney swimming backwards* there she is, finneas. that's it. work up a snork sweat. *with plier* piering plunger, now. *it misses her* up, down, remember girls, no pain *but it gets her in the face* no gain. *laughs* the power pearl is all mine. and it must be full of energy, because it sure is heavy. *realizes he got her and not it* whoops. okay, lady, playtime is over. *places him on the treadmill* you'd better shape up that means 20 miles on this treadmill now. &nbsp.twenty miles.. since when does a bad guy have to be in good shape.. *moans*  come on, guys, i can lift more weight than this. *puff up* okay, enough is enough. *breathes heavily* i can't believe jane flounder does this everyday. *tries stealing it during her situps, but is caught again* so, practicing for the ballet. well this'll slim those thighs, lady. *places him on slingshot, when he shakes and sees her pass by again* finneas, daffney is coming this way. now's our chance. *but he spins around* i don't know which is going to be destroyed first, snorkland or me.  wow, jane flounder's making a personal appearance today. sure is at the neptune vitamin shop to sign watergraphs. oh, i'll show her i'm a true fan and go dress just like her. oh no, she's trying to jet away. so, trying to steal our town, eh. now put em back. yes, sir, right away. *then thrown back out with finneas*  oh it fits you perfectly, dear. is it really me. absolutely. i'll take it.  if you want to look like jane flounder, you'll have to remove that pearl, sweetie. *she does so* as hair stylist* psst, finneas, did you hear that. now's our chance. when i finish this customer's snail sket, you get the power pearl. *he does so* first to rinse and blowfish dry.&nbsp. *has it* at last, it's mine. and it's still working, i see.&nbsp.  hey. *looks at mirror* what have you done to my beautiful hair.. *grabs him* you're not gettin' away with this. *drops power pearl* all finished, daffney. ooks at her new jane flounder look in hand mirror and smiles*  yes, finneas, i should've thought of this sooner. i'll disguise myself by getting the pearl as *forgets until he sees poster* right, jane flounder. and i think i hear her coming. *sees her* yes, there she is. *hides machine* hurry, finenas. *laughs when she's passed by* it worked. *puts on her disguise* that's the long way into snorkland. *gets on an eellimo* giving us plenty of time to get to the neptune vitamin shop. step on it, finneas. *he leaves* finneas. what kind of showfur are you.. back up. *gets him on*&nbsp.  can't wait to meet jane flounder and get her watergraph. *is shocked by the number of fans dressed like her* suffering seashells. everybody looks like jane flounder. *they cheer on* how depressing. everybody acts the same and looks the same. *tears up poster and leaves*&nbsp. finding daffney in a sea of jane flounders will be like finding a snork in a kelp sack. these fans are out of their snorks. come on, finneas, we're leaving. *they hide behind the trash* oh, there goes jane. oh, she hasn't even signed my poster. *they leave with her* swimming with casey and daffney* you didn't get jane flounder's watergraph. sitches the hairstyle and power pearl* who wants it now that everyone looks like her.. i figured out an easier way at being different by just being myself.&nbsp. *laughs as it drops into his hands* well, well, after all the garbage i've been through, the perpetual power pearl just drops into my lap. *tests it out* it's working, finenas. when snorkland is flattened, i'll rename all the streets after me. that'll make them easier to remember. *sees it going out of control* great groupers. the permanent wave machine is getting out of hand. *smashes him* oh no, now i jsut remembered why my brother threw out that power pearl *runs for it* it short circuits every machine, because it's permanently cracked. *finneas mumbles* and no more cracks out of you, finneas.&nbsp.   )
