seastorm, finneas. feeling the wild, unleased energy of the waves brings out the worst in me. *gets hit by seaweed* oh, now where was i. *finneqas whispers it* ah, of course. i'm about to test out my new, most devious device. which one. they all need testing. no, not that one. nah uh, no, i don't think so, but you're getting warmer. *sees machine* hold it, stop everything. that's it. that's my device that stops everything. yes, my stop ocean motion machine will bring snorkland to a stand sitll. now, who can i test it on. *finds it* ah yes, my fleet fin finneas. *turns frozen* by jellyfish, it worked. my stop ocean motion machien stopped you right in your wait. great barrier reef, my machine is short circuiting. *finneas free now* all the reflector shells are ruined. and my beam won't work without them. don't just float there, finneas. bring me encyclpedia aquatica, volume 18. *does it* yes, that's the one. i must find a new source of reflectors, and when i do, i'll crush snorkland.  y poor hair is tangled like a drop of seaweed. oh don't worry, serena. you can borrow my drop shell brush and coral comb. oh, thank you, casey. *hums melody* serena, what is that strange melody. you've been humming it all day. oh, force of habit, casey. it's a tune all young mermaids must practice so the other mermaids can find us if we're stranded or lost. so how did you get lost in the storm. i didn't get lost. i swam away from home. but, but why. look, casey. we're almost the same size. all the mermaids in mermaid del ray are much, much bigger. *flashback to her running away from home* i was too rump. i had to try twice as hard to keep up. so i swam away. i kept going, until my tailfin gave out. then i got caught in the storm, and i might've parrished if you snorks hadn't found me. well, you can always stay in snorkland.  t has to be better than mermaid del ray, where everyone stared because of my size. oh, now that won't hapen in snorkland. *turns off light* <transition>  *with camera crew* okay, boys, get the lights on her. keep those squiddio tapes rolling. junior, what in the whirlpool do you think you're doing.. unior wetworth, snorkwitness news, here

lights on them. all of you with colored shellevisions can see the mermaid colorful tailfin bringing out, blidnign water colors.&nbsp.  where in the waves will i find new reflectors.. on tv* and snorkwitness news will keep after this fast moving mermaid story. i hope everyone out in seev land is getting a good look on those super shiny scales. *sees her* jumping jellyfish. a few scales form that mermaid's tail will fix my stop motion machine. will you know of any idea how long you'll be in snorkland. not long if you keep after her. *pulls plug*&nbsp. hey, what are you doing.. wrapping up this interview. hat is it woth you. got somethign against the news media. we've got you, serena. all snorks aren't liek that seaslug, junior. *dresses as king neptune* there. what mermaid wouldn't
