part of his collection of ancient snorkian relics.  if everyone will move in closer, i'll be glad to answer any questions you might have.&nbsp. what's this.&nbsp. this is very interesting. our ancestors used this stone as a writing tablet. they carved the words with these. *gets out large pin and hammer* you have to be very careful. it's quite *dimmy breaks it* fragile.&nbsp. moan* don't worry, dimmy, i have a dozen of these at home. and now, the oldest snorkelogical find of all. *gets out a pair of handcuffs* oh. oh, what interesting bracelets.&nbsp. they're not bracelets, they're a, they're a, what are they. they were used to control snorks in the days before they lived together in peace.&nbsp. junior nudges him* hey. what do ya mean, "control". it's very simple. *demonstrates it on them* you simply stack them in palce like so.&nbsp. wow, this is pretty strong. *junior tugs it* hey take it easy, junior. ou're under arrest. *snickers* i've had abotu all the fun i can stand. where's the key, uncle gallio. the key.. i, ugh, i never did find the key.&nbsp. huh.. well then how do we get out of this. eah, i don't wanna spend the rest of my life chained to this drip. boys, if you come with me to my lab, i'm sure i can find a way to cut through the metal. oh, let's hope so. i can't have my students in chains. on second thought...  i've never seen metal like this before. oh, this may take a little time. well, you better make it fast. i got big plans for tonight. tonight.. oh no. tonight's my big date with casey.  re you having a good time, casey. oh yes, allstar. there's just one thing. *points at junior* n the other side* pass the seasalt, allwet. m going home, allstar. i hope we do this again real soon alone. ll walk you home, casey.&nbsp. hey. like going out with you, but, now you know what they say. yeah, two is company. and junior is a crowd. *she leaves*  and now, fellow members of the society for deciency in snorkland, the time has come for me to make a special announcement. taxes will have to be raised. goan at him* whispers in his ear* wrong speech. oh yeas, of course. well, i meant to say is, the time has come for me to announce the winner of the junior achievement award. *junior and allstar peek through the curtains* for reaching out his hand and for helping snorks make snorkland a better place, the winner of the junior achievement award is my son, junior wetworth. ows on stage as everyone claps for him* hi, junior. beat it, willie. didn't do nothin'. *pulls curtain to reveal he and allstar in the chains* gasp* he's being a prisoner. he governor's son is a criminal. it's a scandal. *gasps* my baby, a criminal. *faints* what is the meaning of this. hi, governor. um, uh, junior was just reaching out his hand to join with his fellow snorks, that's all. let's get out of here. *drags junior away* after this, you'll be lucky to get your old job back octopus catcher. ooh. *shutters* <transition>  it's no use. this ancient snorkian metal is amazingly storng. there is one thign we haven't tried. what. finding the key. the key.. discovered those handcuffs in a secret cave i discovered a long time ago atop of snork's peak. i didn't think to look for a key. but i'm far too old to climb the mountain now, but  we can go back to the cave and find the key. yeah. we'll take the silverfish and the gang, and  not so fast. the currents up there would make it impossible to stear, and it's far too dangerous to take the others. you'll have to climb up the mountain alone.&nbsp. s it dangerous. on second thought, i'll stay here. you go find it. orry, junior. where you go, i go. h, i feel like a barnacle.&nbsp. this will be a very difficult expedition. you must both promise to cooporate with each other at all times.&nbsp. sigh* let's go. *they try sperating, but can't*  i say we go that way. i say we go that way. this is not cooporation.&nbsp. t is too. you get one vote, i get one vote, it's a tie. that's cooporation. *looks up* junior, i, uh, i think we have a tiebreaker.  ikes. *they get grabbed by it*&nbsp. *sees plant ahead of him* hold on to the plant, junior.&nbsp. huh.. *grabs it* hold on tight. *they slingshot it back* whoa, that was a close one. yeah, good thig we cooporated on my slingshot idea.&nbsp. *glares ath him*  well, there it is. you mean we have to climb that.. don't worry, junior. we'll climb it snork style.&nbsp. don't know. *gets pulled* yipe.&nbsp. as the winds get stronger* now hold on. *jumps over top of him* now it's your turn, junior. snork up over me. does so* hey, this is easy. *trips on rock* whoa. pull me up, you fishbrain. *does so* i could've been killed or soemthing, i huh.. they see the cave* wow, this must be the cave. let's go. but it, but it's dark in there. fraid of the dark, junior.&nbsp. no, i'm afraid of what's in the dark. why don't i stay here and *pulled* yipe.  uh, what's that. it looks like some sort of guardian.  the ancient snorks must've believed it would protect the cave. well, the key must be in here somewhere. but where.&nbsp. hands him a shovel* well, i guess we'll just have to dig for it.&nbsp. ah uh, nah uh, i don't dig digging. well how else are we gonna find it. you don't expect to just stumble over it.&nbsp. actually does that, and it opens to reveal more keys* huh.. wha..&nbsp. oh no.  well, that's the last one. not one of them fits.&nbsp. to statue* oh, this is all your fault, you moldy old snork. i hate you, i hate your cave, i hate that stupid triangle around your neck.&nbsp. triangle. *see triangle on chain and on the neckalce* the key.&nbsp. where. there. it was right in front of our snorks the whole time. *junior goes to it* wait, junior, i have a funny feeling about this. : what's the amtter, allwet. afraid. *pulls it off, and the cave crumbles* yao...&nbsp. let's get out of here.&nbsp. : whoa.  the key i dropped it. that boulder's heading right for snorkland. we have to stop it somehow. *seperate, but bump in again* where are you going. m going back to get the key. that's not important now, we've got only seconds to save snorkland. and i say we get the key first. *allstar pulls him back* hey. junior, we have to cooporate with each other, or snorkland will be smashed, even if it means never getting out of these handcuffs. oh, for once, you're right, allwet. what do we do. i've got an idea. let's go. *they swim* remember what we did to that big fish. oh, you mean my idea. *sighs* yeah, your idea. well i think it can work again. yeah, sure it can. it can.. *grabs it* our timing has to be perfect. timing is my middle name.&nbsp. okay, junior, let her rip.  we did it. e saved snorkland.  huh..  and so it appears that the ancient snorks were very wise indeed. they designed these handcuffs so that the more you struggle, the tighter they become.&nbsp. so when junior and i stopped fighting, and cooporated with each other, they fell right off. can i borrow these, dr. gallio. why of course.  hey, what's the big idea, casey. we have a date tonight, and i'm not taking any chances. *raises eyebrows at the audience and smiles*   )
