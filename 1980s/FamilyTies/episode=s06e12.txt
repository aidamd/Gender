okay, andy, it's way past your bedtime. oh, mom, you said i can stay up till uncle rob gets here. well, i didn't realize they'd be here so late. come on. you can see uncle rob and your cousins in the morning. oh, mom, come on. it'sit's a pivotal point in the game. okay, dad, go fish. you sly dog. so how come uncle rob's coming so late anyway. oh, he got one of those cheapo flights very inexpensive, but not too convenient. it stops twice in st. louis. why does it stop twice in st. louis. they're practicing takeoffs and landings. it's not like uncle rob to fly cheapo. he usually goes first class. well, that's all changed. rob doesn't have much money since the divorce. huh. show me the man who does. maureen said it was a very fair settlement. pshaw. rob said so, too. the reason there's not much money is that, uh, rob switched careers. he's, uh, given up accounting. oh, what's he doing now. i'm not sure what he's doing now. maybe he's an astronaut. that's my guess. i wish he'd get here. i'm getting sleepy. i almost forgot. come on, andy, let's go to bed. thanks, mal. oh, give him a minute, elyse. come on, andy. well the game's not over. you lose, dad. good night, andrew. okay, that's them. now, let's not forget that rob and the kids have really gone through a tough time lately. let's try and remember to be sensitive to that. you know, when i talked to rob, he didn't sound like a guy who'd been through a tough time. he didn't sound down at all. he sounded happy. dad, will you stop bugging me.. listen, marilyn, if you're going to talk to me that way, let's get back on the plane and go home, that's all. sounds happy as a clam. here we go. uncle rob. hey. hi. how are you. hi, sweetheart. hey, stevie. how you doing, bro. hey. who's this. alex. andy. hi. hey, look at you, jonathan. you really shot up. how you been. i'm fine. and how you been, marilyn. fine. well, everyone's fine. that's fine. marilyn, i think you could fill them in a little more, don't you, honey. no, dad, i don't. i really have nothing else to say. i didn't want to come here, the flight was miserable, and i'm counting the hours till we go home. mallory, can i talk to you upstairs. well, i find her candor refreshing. alex, i would really appreciate if you didn't read the newspaper at the table. why is that, dear. don't call me "dear.
