i bet we've been together for a million years and i'll bet we'll be together for a million more oh, it's like i started breathing on the night we kissed and i can't remember what i ever did before what would we do, baby without us. what would we do, baby without us. and there ain't no nothin' we can't love each other through oohhoo what would we do, baby without us. shalalala is it midnight yet. eight more minutes. mallory's never violated her curfew before. she still has eight minutes, elyse. that's right. seven minutes. come on, steven. this is silly. we should be happy that she's going out with someone as nice as rick. he's a terrific kid. he's a terrific college man, elyse. he's 18. she's 16. that's only two years' difference in their age. that is a very big difference at this age, elyse. let him come back when he's 35 and she's 33. we know rick. we like rick. he's never been anything but a perfect gentleman with me. it's not you i'm worried about, elyse. mallory's here. let's get out of here. why. we don't want her to know we've been waiting up for her. oh, right. right. oh, the kitchen. the bedroom. bedroom. oh. the kitchen. the kitchen. we made it. with five minutes to spare. i had so much fun at that party, rick. i like your friends a lot. they liked you, too. three different guys asked me if you had any sisters. really. yeah. oh, by the way, tell jennifer that biff, rocky, and howard will be calling her tomorrow. well, here we are again our couch. i'm beginning to feel like i should pay rent on it. you don't need to. the landlady likes you. that was really nice. yeah, let's do it again sometime. i'm free now. whoa. i think you better go now, rick. i'm expected to walk to my car after this. rick. sorry, but it's hard for me to get worked up like this every time i go out with you and then just drive home alone. it isn't easy for me, either. mallory we've been seeing each other for four months now, and they've been four of the best months of my life. i feel the same way. but for us to keep going together, i think we need to explore new territory expand the horizons of our relationship, and and discover the wonders of nature. are you trying to say we should go camping. this this is tough for me to to ask you this, 'cause i hear myself and i sound like a like another guy coming on to a girl when when you know that's not what's going on here. don't you. i do. but it's a big step for me, rick. i know. i know. but look at it this way you won't have to go through it alone. i'll be with you. oh, is that how it works. pretty much. think about it. i will. so, mallory, what are you gonna do about rick. are you gonna sleep with him. i don't know. i haven't decided yet. the way i see it, you got two choices you do it or you lose him. that's not true. oh, come on, margo. rick's in college. if mallory won't sleep with him, he can find plenty of girls who will. sex is practically on the curriculum. that's no reason to do it. are you in love with rick, mallory. i'm not sure. i might be. i know i've never felt this way about any other guy. bill and i have been going together for two years. we're in love, and we haven't slept together. what do you want, a medal. no. i just want mallory to know she doesn't have to rush into anything. i'm not so sure about that. guys like rick don't walk into your life every day. at least your first time will be something worth remembering, not like mine and danny frankl you and danny franklin. kathy, you didn't tell us. this is major information here. it was a mistake. i got carried away. i mean, he didn't love me. he just wanted to go to bed with me like any man in his right mind. hi. just wanted to make myself a sandwich. well, do you have to do it in here. this is where we keep the food. dad. never mind. i'll just go gnaw on the woodwork. mallory if you decide to do this, be sure to get some birth control. well, rick said he'd take care of that. you can't rely on the guy, mallory. he's not the one who's gonna get pregnant. i don't know. isn't it kind of unromantic to plan the whole thing. it's also unromantic to be 16 and pregnant. okay, on that happy note um, we got to go. i was supposed to pick up my mom a halfhour ago. call me if you want to talk about it, okay. okay. thanks. see you, mal. bye, mal. did i just hear your friends leave. yeah. kathy had to pick her mom up. ah. you need any help cleaning up. no, thanks. can we have a talk, mallory. sure. yeah, ii don't know exactly how to put this, so i'll just i'll just come right out and say it. are you and rick you know. you know. not exactly how i meant to phrase it. it shouldn't be so hard for me to talk to you about sex. i'm your mother. i knew you before you were born. do we have to talk about this, mom. well, yeah, we do. see, mallory, ii know how you feel about rick, and ii thought maybe you'd be confused and you could use a talk. i don't know what you mean, mom. i'm not confused at all. oh, i've got a lot of homework to get done, so, um, i better get started. here. have a cookie. i got to go. ii don't want a cookie. ii want to talk. jennifer, is this absolutely necessary. i told you i have a school assignment to record family conversations. what are you studying to be, an fbi agent. alex, this is jennifer's school project. we'll be glad to help. jennifer, if you don't mind. dad, why don't we take a break, get a snack. funny how you always want to take a break when i'm winning, alex. checkmate, dad. you happy. how'd he do that. louder, dad. how did he do oh. well, i guess this is good night. it has the usual elements. it's dark out, and you're shutting the door in my face. you know, i think there's a chance i might get to like you. you think so, huh. just a hunch. and you. uh, i'm not sure. maybe. um, mallory have you given any thought to what we talked about the other night. it did cross my mind a few thousand times. well, look, ii know that that you have some doubts about this, that it's a big step for you, but i've been thinking about it, too, and i have a few things to say on the subject rick my answer is yes. ii got so nervous, i forgot the rest of my my my speech. thank you. oh, al alex, you busy. uh, yeah, kind of, dad. look, look, jennifer's getting frustrated about this project of hers. she hasn't gotten a usable conversation on tape yet. well, i'm trying to figure out a calculus problem, dad. come on. come on. it'll just take a second. look, when i press "record," let's have a spontaneous conversation. so alex, my son i see you're doing some math homework. yes, dad. my father. i sure am. how goes it. all goes well, dad. great thing about numbers you can always count on 'em. oh. oh, my. that is very funny. dad. yes. this is the most boring conversation i have ever had. i know. me me too. we're putting too much pressure on ourselves to be spontaneous. see you later, son. alex, do you have a minute. i want to ask you a question. i'm all ears. well, you're a guy. mallory, uh i'm not just a guy. i like to think of myself as a guy and a half. what's up. okay, i was wondering how important is sex to a guy. well, i'd say it has a certain importance. well, on a scale of 1 to 10. that's what i thought. wait. why are you asking me this. i'm just making conversation. no, no, no, no, no. this is not conversation. conversation is, uh, "how you doing." uh, "looks like rain. " "care for a waffle." there's something going on here you're not telling me. wait a minute, mallory. uh, has rick asked you to visit his tepee. you mean sleep with him. yeah. yeah, has he. well, yeah, he has. oh. well, when you said you wouldn't sleep with him i mean, you were nice to him. i mean, you let him down easy, i hope. i said yes. i see. uh, just a moment. are you crazy. is this the way i brought you up. cut it out, alex. look, mallory, you're making a big mistake here. you are 16 years old. that is too young. well, have you ever. have i ever what. had someone visit your tepee. me. of course i have. but i was much older than you. you're 16. i was 17. and a half. i was 17, 8 months, and 3 days, and it was leap year. you're babbling, alex. look, mallory, yyou just can't do this. it's wrong. you're not ready yet. why wasn't it wrong when you did it. oh, come on. that's different. i'm a guy. that is such a double standard, alex. if a guy loses his virginity, he's some kind of hero, but if a girl does, she's ruined her life. that's stupid. well, it may be stupid, but it's the law of nature. you can't fight that. look, it's your duty as a woman to say no. you know, if women shirk that responsibility, men, uh, men would never get any work done. well, alex, it's obvious that you can't be objective about this. why do you want to do this, mallory. well, i care very much about rick. and i'm attracted to him. i'm curious. i'm curious about astronomy. you don't see me riding the space shuttle. look, uh, mallory why don't you, uh why don't you talk to mom about this. she lives for this stuff. i can't do that, alex. you know how hard it is to talk to parents about this. all right. okay. well, whatever you decide to do, don't do it. alex, i know, in your own warped way, you've tried to help. i appreciate it. why are these kids in such a hurry to grow up. well, this is it. the folks from architectural digest will be here next week, so try not to mess up. i'll do my best. allow me to take care of a few details. first mood lighting. second, soft music. oh. the stereo's broken. i forgot. uh mmmmm it's the best i can do. and finally some flowers. they have to be back by midnight. so do i. mm, rick, did you get what we talked about. birth control. oh. um i stopped by the drugstore on the way to pick you up. uh, i also got some, uh, dental floss and baseball cards, too. thanks. oh, no problem. uh, i got doubles of reggie jackson if you want one. rick, how do you feel right now. i mean, are you happy we're gonna do this. you can't begin to imagine how happy. what's the problem. i don't know. i'm just a little nervous about this, that's all. that's only natural. could we talk for a little while first. sure. what do you wanna talk about. i don't know. we never had trouble making conversation other times. yeah, well, other times haven't been right before we're about to make love. that is just the point, rick. i mean, things shouldn't change because of sex. if if we can make conversation other times, we should be able to make conversation now. let's talk. um did you enjoy dinner tonight. very much. me too. okay, i'm ready. mallory, look the last thing i want to do is to put any pressure on you. if you don't want to do this, if you don't want to make love tonight, then just say so. i don't want to make love tonight. why not.. we talked about it. we we planned on it. i got the flowers. i thought i wanted to sleep with you, and now all of a sudden i'm scared. i don't know if i'm ready for this. mallory, i care about you. i really do. but i'm not in high school anymore. and if we're gonna have a relationship, it's got to keep moving forward. and is sex the only way that's gonna happen. no, no, no. it's not the only way. but it's definitely my favorite. maybe i should go home now. that's a good idea. why don't you. are we gonna see each other again. i don't know. oh. hi, mallory. you're home early. how was your date with rick. fine. what did you do. oh, uh, gosh. we saw a movie. ah. what did you see. uh i forget exactly. something part two. well, where's rick. why didn't he come in with you. he didn't bring me home. we had a fight. ah. uh, do you want to talk about it. mom, if i ask you something, do you promise not to ask why i'm asking. all right. is there any way to know when is the right time in your life for sex. oh, why do you ask. don't worry. nothing's happened. it's just sort of been on my mind lately, that's all. i mean, whether you can ever be sure of the right time. can you. ii don't think there is any positive way to know when is the right time. in fact, i'm not even sure there's such a thing as the absolute right time. it's so hard for me to sort out my feelings from what my friends say or what the guy says or what i read in magazines. mom, i want to do what is best for me, but right now i'm too confused to know what that is. well, if you're confused then then i think you should wait. you'll you'll be able to handle it much better when you're older. i know i will. and what if waiting means losing a boyfriend i like a lot. any boyfriend worth keeping will understand. he should know that sex should never be used as a test of love. thanks, mom. i'm glad we had this talk. so am i. mallory. i won't stay long. i just want to talk about what happened tonight. hi, there, rick. oh, mrs. keaton, what a a pleasant surprise. mm. mom, can i talk to rick for a minute. hmm. oh, uh, sure. i was just going up. good night, rick. what did you want to say. mallory, i'm i'm disappointed at the way things went tonight. and i'd i'd be lying if i said otherwise. but i took a shower, and i feel a little better now. is that what you came over to tell me. no. no, that's not all. i, uh ii know that i'm i'm not the most sensitive guy in the world, especially when my hormones take over. and if you don't want to go out with me anymore, i understand. but ii hope that's not how you feel, because i'd really like to keep seeing you, mallory. how'd that sound. fine. good. i practiced it the whole ride over. i do want to keep seeing you, rick, but i'm not ready to sleep with you. hey, that's okay. if you're not comfortable with it, then neither am i. okay. maybe we could set thanksgiving as the target date. )
