worship me, and i reject you. mallory, those were wonderful years. but it's over. try to be strong. by the way, does jane talk about me much. she doesn't even know you exist. that's good. because once they know i exist, that's when i run into trouble. if she means that much to you, i'll talk to her. i don't know how that mouse got away. i was sure i had him cornered. face it, dad: he was toying with you. i'll get him, jennifer. he's in this house somewhere. and i'll find him. i'm not so sure, dad. this is one smart mouse. not smarter than you and i put together. come on, write this down. all right, we're gonna need some, uh some plywood. a couple of hinges. some nails. uhhh chicken wire. a bell. a quart of varnish. and some cheese. you know, mr. keaton, my dad, uh, once built a mousetrap. but it never worked. maybe he didn't use the right kind of bait. no. no, no. the bait was fine. i know because i used to eat it before the mouse could get to it. come on, jen, let's work on these plans upstairs. oh, uh, can i come. i i might be of some use. sure, skip. yeah, coming. hi, uh, jane. what a what a pleasant surprise. sorry to bother you, alex. i'm just here to study with mallory. oh, well, no no bother. no bother at all, jane. uh, come on in. sit down. sit down. so, uh, what are you studying there. medieval english poetry. oh, really. uh do you know who is a real expert on medieval english poetry. skippy. skippy. uh, yeah. skippy, uh, handleman. remember the, uh the the tall, goodlooking fella who was here yesterday. you mean the lamp. uh, jane, can i. can i ask you a personal question. go ahead. are you seeing anybody right now. i mean, do you have a boyfriend. no one special. oh, so in other words, you are not dating anyone on a regular basis. no. that's great news. that is great news. i'm very glad to hear that. really. oh, yeah. i can't think of anything that would make me happier. i can't think of anything that would make me happier than hearing you say that, alex. what do you mean, jane. alex, i've had a desperate, passionate yearning for you ever since i was a little kid. oh. oh, that's what you mean. i didn't know you then, jane. but i knew you. i used to watch you across the playground when you were playing with the big kids. and in high school when you ran for student council president, i voted for you i'm sorry you didn't win. well, you did all you could. alex, i've waited for this all my life. that was a terrific kiss, alex. thank you. you know who's also a terrific kisser. skippy. how do you know. we went to kissing school together. you sure you wanna talk about skippy. who. alex, you've been telling jane about me for three days. when am i gonna get to go out with her. well, i'm i'm not through telling her about you yet, skip. how much is there to tell. your life is not easy to explain. you're a you're a very, very complicated guy. now, why don't you just go home and be patient, and and i'll let you know how it's going. all right, i'm gonna go home and practice for when i get to talk to her. good idea. good idea. hello, jane. i'm skippy. skippy sounds so babyish. hello, jane. i'm ricardo montalban. that's it. hey, alex. dad, are you sure this mousetrap won't hurt the mouse. i'm positive. it'll just, uh, trap him in the box. then we'll just set him loose in a field somewhere. poor mouse. we'll be taking him far from his home. to a place where he doesn't have any friends. maybe doesn't even speak the language. he'll be lost, homesick, lonely. what kind of life is that. oh, but but on the other hand, it'll open up new, exciting opportunities for him. eexpand his horizons. give him the kind of life he's always dreamed of having. he's a mouse, dad, not an exchange student. i'll go put another coat of varnish on this. all right. ahem. hello. uh, hi, jane. uh, just thinking about me, huh. what a coincidence. i was just thinking about me too. uh no. no, no, no, no. not not not on the phone, jane. no. no, come on, please. just not on the ph all right. all all right. okay, uh bbyebye. who was that. skippy's girlfriend. how are they getting along. dad, this has gotten completely out of hand. you see, skippy saw jane, and he fell instantly in love with her. and he tried to talk to her, but all he could get out was mlaaaah. so he asked me to try and talk to her, which i did. only to find out that she's been in love with me since the first grade. so skippy thinks i've been telling her about him for three days, but every time ii bring up his name, she cuts me off with a kiss. whew. how much of this does skippy know. uh, everything up to the mlaaaah. i see. what am i gonna do, dad. well, let's face it, alex. if you wanted to, you could've put a stop to this. yeah, but i'm attracted to her, dad. and she's attracted to me. we're beginning to develop a very significant, very meaningful lust for each other. well, look. alex, obviously this girl is a lot more important to skippy than she is to you. i think you know what you should do. yeah. yeah, you're right, dad. i should've put a stop to this a long time ago. and i'm going to right now. or at the very least next week. alex. all right, i'll call her. hi, jane. yeah. yeah, it's me again. uh, listen, i was wondering, how would you like to have dinner at guido's. oh, that much, huh. all right. uh, okay. yeah, oh, it'll it'll be great. uh, candlelight and quiet music. and skippy. i'm very nervous. i'm more than nervous. i'm petrified. what if i. if i say the wrong thing. what if i do the wrong thing. look, skippy, just trust your instincts, okay. you can't go wrong. all right. i, uh i brought along $10. i thought i might give it to jane as a gift. on second thought, ignore your instincts. okay. i can do that. do that. sure. hello, guys. oh, jane, uh won't you join us. uhhh you'll have to excuse skippy. he's just feeling a little, uh, peppy tonight. why don't we all just sit down and and get to know each other a little better. i'm all for that. so so, skippy, uh, why don't you tell jane a little bit about yourself, huh. tell her about that time you saved your little sister's life. well, it was nothing, really. it was, uh just a matter of simple reflexes, that's all. i'm gonna go wash my hands, okay. uh, you two get to know each other a little better while i'm gone. please don't leave me. uh, skippy. we're very close. skippy, i'll be right back, okay. so how long have you known alex. i can't remember. do you live next door or across the street from alex. are you all right. you're not having some kind of attack, are you. no. good. i'm really glad we had this opportunity to talk. great. hi. i hope i gave you two enough time alone together. i think so. excuse me. uh i'm gonna go wash my hair. skippy, you mean your hands. right. i mean, i'm gonna wash the hair on my hands. he's quite a guy, isn't he. i'll say. i missed you while you were gone, alex. uhhh i i was only gone for two minutes, jane. i don't know what it is about you, alex. but you bring out the animal in me. hope i'm not being too forward. i understand. hi, we're here to pick up a pizza for keaton, please. mallory, look. jennifer and mallory. what are you. what are you guys doing here. um, we're come on over and say hello to alex and jane. uh, no, skippy, don't go over there. why not. um i'm sorry, mallory, but i'm spoken for.
