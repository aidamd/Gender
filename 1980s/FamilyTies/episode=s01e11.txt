hands off that. that's my present to mom. steven, i want you to open this one first. it's from me to you. well well, really, it's for the whole family. oh, no. another "whole family" gift. not another trash compactor. a photo album. and unless i missed my guess, there's a brandnew camera to go along with it. no, no camera. oh, just an album, huh. no camera. yeah, just the album. don't you remember. we said we were gonna be creative this year and make gifts, instead of spending a lot of money christmas shopping. well, ii know we said it. ii just didn't know we meant it. why don't you just open the album. hey, peace corps pictures. i'd rather have a trash compactor. where'd you dig these up. well, that's the surprise. see, the whole album is filled with pictures from the time that we met until the present. oh, thank you, honey. that's very sweet. oh. hey, look, there's one of alex as a baby. why is he wearing a tie. those are beads. alex wearing beads. i want this one enlarged. hey, look. it wasn't my choice to be born in africa. oh, i got to sit down. me too. oh, i'm sorry. are you okay. yeah, is it hot, or is it just me. oh. it's 109. it's just you. did you happen to hear the weather forecast for tomorrow. i did, elyse. it's gonna cool off a little tomorrow. they say the old mercury will be dipping down to about 105. the humidity should be about minus 14. is this at least a recordbreaking drought we're living through. no, no. there was a longer one last year. in fact, this is still last year's drought. sorry i brought it up. i shouldn't talk about it. the more i talk about it, the more it bothers us. you're right. let's not bring up the drought again. dry enough for you. max. i'm sorry, elyse. the drought is really starting to get to me. and it's not just me, either. i saw a camel buying an airline ticket. look. look, max. it's not that bad, and don't forget, tomorrow the villagers are doing that big rain dance. i'm glad you told me. i was gonna wash my car. look, we can't let them go through with this rain ceremony, can we. why not. it sounds fascinating. no. it's ridiculous. look, i want to see the end to this drought as much as the next man, but, uh, we can't have the people going off and performing some crazy ritual that perpetuates superstition and fear. why not. it gives me the willies. there's something to be said for their way of life as it is now. you know, they they live in harmony with nature. they they have a close, intimate connection to the land. you can't take that away. and and just give them aa toaster oven and and an alarm clock in return. how 'bout we throw in some flashlights. some of those guys get a big kick out of that stuff. can i ask you a personal question, max. yeah, sure. why did you choose africa as a place to do your peace corps service. i didn't. my first choice was miami beach. i mean, why did you join at all. oh, um it was kennedy's speech, i guess. it really inspired me. it made me ask not what my country could do for me, but, rather, ask not what my country had done. could do. oor i could do. you know what i mean. hey, it's a tough speech to remember. was that a "here comes the baby" scream. i'm gonna take that as a "yes. " max, can you go get dr. ellis, please. sure. okay, honey, hold on. i'm comin'. you know, i think i remember it now. it's, "ask not what your country " max. oh, oh. are you feeling okay. fine. i'm just a little nervous. okay, okay. just relax. uh, try to take your mind off this. oh, okay. so, uh, read any good books lately. forget books. what what about movies. we haven't seen a movie in 10 months, steven. elyse do you realize what's gonna happen. we're going to have a baby. i know. it doesn't feel real. it does from here. elyse. it's raining. come on out here. i'm busy, steven. oh, it's a miracle. oh, let me have a sip of your sleeve. we're gonna be a mother, elyse. i mean, we're not both gonna be a mother. one of us will be the mother. the other one will be the father. i'll be the mother, okay. okay. and i won't be the kind of father who says, "do this. don't do that. "eat all your peas. eat all my peas. " ii think we should treat him or or her as an autonomous individual, a unique personality, a one in a million steven. what. please shut up. you look beautiful. so do you. what a day. let's try to remember every detail. i don't think it'll be easy to forget. so, what happened next. i don't remember. do you, elyse. no. well, of course i remember. dr. ellis came, and and pretty soon alex was born. made a pretty big hit over there, too. everyone thought he was so cute. must have been the heat. whatever happened to max. he lives in miami beach, runs max's kosher african deli. closed on saturdays and nigerian bank holidays. boy, am i glad i was born right here in the usa. i'd hate to think i started life someplace where they'd never heard of a clearance sale. ha. no, when you were born, there were other problems. there's one. well, mrs. keaton, you are definitely in labor. lucky for you, i majored in labor relations. see, that's a play on the word "labor.
