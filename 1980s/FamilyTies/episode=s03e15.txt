like this. well, dad, it's the least i could do. i mean, we gotta get this junk out of the house. we all have to make sacrifices. and i'm willing to do my part. well, what do you have there. everything in mallory's closet. hey, jen, give me a hand with mallory's bed. i hope aunt trudy and mallory hurry up and get home. they've been gone for over three hours. that's no surprise. they have a great relationship. they always have. you know, in some ways, mallory and aunt trudy are very much alike. in that case, there's no chance they'll find their way home. hi. sorry we're late. we got lost. we had the most wonderful time. what'd you do. we went to seeswan lake. oh, swan lake. dad, remember we used to go fishing i remember. i'm still picking the feathers out of my teeth. it's a ballet, you fools. it's a ballet. oh. they're hopeless. i've known that for a long time. they pretend to be ignorant and they make the most smashing success of it. no, it's great to see you, aunt trudy. and, uh, we wanna thank you for getting mallory out of the house for a few hours every week. hey, uh, how do you feel about her moving in with you. be my pleasure, alex. in fact, all three of you kids can move in. no, you see, that would be defeating the purpose. i want to get as much distance as i can between me and her. hey. hey. hi, everybody. oh, hi, aunt trudy. oh, hi, skippy. ah, skippy, you bring that over for the garage sale. bring what over. the moose head. no. ssss. the ties are for the garage sale. the moose head was just to help me carry them over. i don't know, aunt trudy. i want to do better in school, but i can't ever seem to. how much did you study last night. not at all. why don't you try doubling that. there. oh, great. whee. you know, i see a lot of myself in you, mallory. i have ever since you were a little girl. really. mmhm. and don't you worry about this school stuff. you're a very bright girl. and you're gonna be a late bloomer just like i was. i hope so. you know, whenever i try to concentrate on school, my mind drifts to other things. what other things. boys. oh, that'll change. soon you'll drift to men. did, uh. did you used to date a lot, aunt trudy. i mean, before you were married. i had a date or two. what was it like. i mean, dating when you were a girl. well, it wasn't all that different than it is today. he picked you up in his packard, took you to see tyrone power at the movies, then out to the corner soda fountain, then you fought him off in the rumble seat. i guess some things never change. what else have you been doing with your life, besides boys. um, well, i learnt a new dance step in my ballet class. why don't you show me. okay. oh, hi, aunt trudy. oh, hi, skippy. where's mallory. she just stepped out. i'll get it. oh, mallory. come on in. trudy and i were just talking about you. skippy, what are you doing here. i was showing aunt trudy some dance steps. why were you doing them outside. skippy, how can you be so stupid. well skippy isn't stupid, mallory. i'm not. no, of course not. you remind me of a dance student i had many years ago. he also used to march to his own drummer. you know what i mean. no. i don't have my own drummer. see what i mean. that dance student i just mentioned. yeah. he turned out to be my husband. don't even joke about that, aunt trudy. aunt trudy, how was mallory as a dancer when she was a kid. tell me everything. well, mallory was a great tap dancer, much better than alex. oh, dear. alex took tap dancing. he made me promise never to tell. huh. well, what was he like. he was the worst dancer in the history of the human foot. wow, this is the greatest news. i can't wait to use this. mallory, you mustn't. i gave my word. oh, was he bad. all right, i won't say anything, but it's breaking my heart. skippy. oh, uh, i won't say anything either, aunt trudy. oh, mallory. this is great. you and i are sharing a secret. think of the knowing looks we can exchange. the whispers, the winks. skippy, if i ever wink at you, it's only because i got a bug in my eye. oh what's the matter, aunt trudy. oh, i i'm all right. i, uh well, you don't look all right. um, why don't i get you a drink of water or something. no, no. i'll just sit down here for a few minutes. ooh. oh, as a matter of fact, i think i better sit down in a hospital. okay. what's taking 'em so long. she's been in there over an hour. i don't know. i'll find out. uh, miss. i didn't find out everything, but i think i established a relationship that'll be useful to us later. skippy, i'm scared. don't worry. everything's gonna be okay. i'm scared about aunt trudy. i know. she's a very special person. yeah. remember when i was a little kid and i used to come over to the house when she was visiting, and we'd play hideandseek. no one else would look for me. i remember what she used to say about you. "that skippy is one of a kind. " i hear that a lot. i know, but she meant it as a compliment. excuse me, miss. my aunt went in there about an hour ago, and i wanna know what's taking so long, okay. i wanna see a doctor. miss, we've got two gunshot victims, three pregnant women, and a guy who swallowed a can of paint. no, no, no. no, they won't do. we wanna see a doctor. we'll send someone as soon as we can. oh, where is she. how's she doing. mr. keaton, she's been in there so long. and what did the doctor say. we haven't seen the doctor yet. dad, i'm really worried. they won't tell us anything. oh, i'll see what i can find out. oh oh, miss. we had the same conversation. oh, how is she. is she okay. i'm sorry, miss. we couldn't save her. well, i hope i bought enough food. it's hard to know how many people are going to pay condolence calls. trudy had so many friends. there's plenty of food, dad. someone else could die, we'd still have enough food. i love this kind with the pimento in it. well, i wish your mother was in town. she knows more about entertaining than i do. will you two stop talking about the food, please. whoa. mallory, sorry. take it easy. don't tell me to take it easy. listen, mallory, i don't

was she. sixtysix. struck down just like that. that's not fair. it isn't fair. oh, it's a crime. i'm so, so sorry. thank you. could i sit down just for a minute. please. alex, get rid of these people now. all right. aall right. uh excuse me. excuse me. could i have your attention for a moment, please. who is here for the garage sale. show of hands, please. okay, good. and who is here for the condolence call. oh, well. okay. uh, garage sale people follow me. mourners over here by the cold cuts. well this must be the place. it's not funny, alex. i'm sorry. i'm sorry. um, just nervous, and it just came out. sometimes, uh sometimes a joke, even, uh, an inadvertent joke, can help ease the tension at a time like this. did you hear the one about the nun and the priest. skippy. mr. keaton. i'm reverend wilson. hello, reverend. nice to meet you. please, let me offer my condolences to all of you. i'll be conducting the funeral services for the dearly departed. reverend wilson, aunt trudy was a very special person to all of us. who. aunt trudy, the dearly departed. oh, yes. please go on. what i was gonna say is that aunt trudy always loved singing and dancing. um, music was everything to her. she even tried to teach me how to play the piano once, but i was so tonedeaf tonedeaf. oh, i see. i remember one day, i uh, excuse me. i think we'll have to begin the service shortly. but i've hardly told you anything about aunt trudy. well, i'm sorry. i'll do the best i can. mallory, we better sit down now. dad, it's not fair. he never even met aunt trudy. mallory, i'm sure he'll handle it tactfully. yeah, he seems like a decent guy, mallory. bit of a devilmaycare attitude about him, but i'm sure he'll come through. we should invite him to the garage sale. we are gathered here today to say farewell to gertrude harris. while i did not have the honor to know gertrude, it's easy to see that she made many friends in this world. she was also dearly loved by her family, who referred to her affectionately as aunt gerty. did you hear that, dad. he called her gerty. nobody called her gerty. aunt gerty brought joy to many of us in this room. she was a very musical person, despite the handicap of being tonedeaf. she wasn't tonedeaf. i was. hey. but as it happens to all of us, aunt gerty has passed on to a better world. no. her name wasn't aunt gerty. it was aunt trudy. mallory, sit down, please. and she wasn't just like everyone else, 'cause she was different. how can you talk about a woman you never even met. mallory, come on, honey. sit down. no, dad. nobody cares that aunt trudy's gone. i mean, alex is thinking about his garage sale, and the reverend can't remember her name. uh, excuse us, reverend. mallory, i'm sure we all share your sense of grief at this moment. no, you don't. i was the closest with her. i shared secrets with aunt trudy that no one else even knew. i mean, how many of you knew she was a dancer. i knew that. and that she loved to teach and spend time with young people. i knew that. and how many of you knew that she used to fight off dates in a rumble seat. that i didn't know. all of you are just looking at your watches, trying to figure out what time you're gonnabe home, but i loved trudy. she was the nicest person i'd ever known, and now she's gone, and i feel alone. i mean, don't you understand. my aunt trudy's dead. honey, come on. i'm sorry. i knew that. hey. hi. the funeral over. yeah. you know, after, uh, you ran out, the minister invited other people to come up and say nice things about trudy. the dentist talked about her teeth for half an hour. i'm gonna miss her, alex. we're all gonna miss her. she was really something, you know. i mean, she could make you say things aand do things you never thought you would. you know, nobody in the world knows this, but, uh she once taught me how to tapdance. really. yeah. and i don't want to brag, but she said i showed a lot of potential. it's not gonna be the same. no, it's not. you'll be okay. come here. all right. i'll leave you alone. okay. just, um hi, mallory. hi, jennifer. mallory, if it makes you feel any better, after you left, the minister started calling her aunt trudy. he started calling everyone aunt trudy. how are you. um i'm okay. dad, i'm sorry. what happened back there. okay, i was angry. i was angry at you for letting it go on like that and for not getting a better minister and for lettin' everyone tell jokes and stuff. i mean, it didn't seem like anybody cared. people mourn in very different ways. some people have to distance themselves. that's how they deal with it. you shouldn't mistake that for lack of love. mm. maybe i should have tried to distance myself a little, huh. well, you were upset, you were angry, and you were sad. it's important to get those feelings out, rather than keep them inside. i sure got 'em out. you sure did. i i don't know anybody who's good at handling these things. i don't i don't deal that well with death myself. funerals are usually your mother's area. what do you mean. well, when you've been together as long as your mom and i have, you tend to divide the big emotional responsibilities. your mother handles, uh, funerals, first dates and plumbing. i handle, uh, colds and flus, open school nights, and, uh, office supplies. dad, where do you think aunt trudy is right now. she's probably still at the funeral home. you see, they no no, i i mean, where do you think she is right now. someplace nice, someplace green. someplace with a lot of music. do you believe in god, dad. i do. i know i i don't talk about it very much, but i believe in god. not in a fire and brimstone, hell and heaven god, but i believe in a higher spirit, something controlling the universe. what do you think god looks like. i always pictured him as looking like cary grant. and and he'd he'd see me and say: hello, stevie, how are you. tell me something about yourself. but of course, i know everything about you, don't i. i hope aunt trudy's with cary grant. she'd like that. i miss aunt trudy, dad. we all do. mmhm. um, i don't know how to let go of her. you don't you don't have to let go. hold on to those memories. go ahead and cry. go ahead. but when you finish crying, i want you to do something. um, what. look, remember all the fun things about aunt trudy. remember the happy times. and then, when you think of her, maybe you'll be able to smile. )
