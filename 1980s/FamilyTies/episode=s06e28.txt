 i bet we've been together for a million years and i bet we'll be together for a million more oh, it's like i started breathing on the night we kissed and i can't remember what i ever did before what would we do, baby, without us. what would we do, baby, without us. and there ain't no nothing we can't love each other through what would we do, baby, without us. okay, andy, here's your pop sticks and here's your glue. what are you going to make. a mess. come on, andy. what did nick teach you in art class. he taught me to let your artistic ideas spill out all over the place. sure. that's because he doesn't have to clean it up. i want to make a present for nick. i'm going to miss my art class. i know you are, andy. why does it have to end. well, 'cause the community center needs the space and the class was only for six weeks anyway, so it has to end. i can't work under these conditions. hi, guys. well, this was a successful trip to the supermarket. and good news. there was a special on turkey franks. it was not a special. sure there was. buy 300, get one free. what's all this stuff. oh, andy's making a farewell gift for nick. a farewell gift for nick. let me help. dad, relax. nick's not going anywhere. it's just that his art class is ending. that's such a shame. you know, i picked up andy there last week, andand i saw nick teaching. he's wonderful with those kids. and he's not taking this sitting down. he wants to start his own art school. he went to the bank today to get a loan. a loan. they won't even give him a calendar. don't laugh. alex went with him. i think he really has a chance. alex: just explain to me, nick, explain to me how you could do that, okay. you completely blew it. what happened. what happened, we go down to the bank, my favorite bank. they love me there. i mean, the bank manager's got a picture of me on his desk. so what went wrong. heyhey, i don't know. ii walk into the bank, i go up to the guy behind the counter, and i say, "i need $5,000 and quick. " so. so he rang the alarm. i had to identify him to the police. i hope the bank invites me to the annual money fondling picnic again. well, i guess that's the end of the art school. this seems so wrong. i mean, all you need is $5,000. you know, i don't think you have any other choice. there's only one place to go to get this money, and you know it. where's that. to your father. : yes. : thank god. uh, no way. i told you, he and i are not on speaking terms. there is no way that i am asking him. okay, everybody, paint brushes down. all right, all right. let's check it out, see what we got here, huh. whoa. hey, you know something. we're good. you know something. you're right, we are good. this is great, huh. anyway, next week, we are going to do collages. what about the week after that. there isn't going to be any week after that, honey. class is over then.  heyheyheyheyheyheyheyhey. but that does not mean you guys got to stop doing your work, right. okay, now come on. let's get your coats and everything. everybody find your moms. byebye. we'll see you next week. kids: bye. nick, i already did my work. oh, hey, andy. this is very creative. you got, let me see, a house with a tree,

pleasure, nick. hey, byebye, andy. byebye. byebye, mr. keaton. byebye, art class. nick, you can't let this happen. you've got to keep teaching. well, mal, what am i going to do. how about your father. oh, no, no, no. he is not going to help me. he has to, nick. that's the rule. fathers have to help their children. mal, he walked out on us when i was 11 years old. well, do you know where he is now. yeah, sure. he's got a, uh, used car lot downtown. joe moore's motors. joe moore.. the one on tv.. i love his commercials. especially the one where he walks on top of the cars wearing stilts. how does he do that. i don't know. he used to do that at home, too. nick, a lot of time has passed. i mean, maybe he's changed. nick, give him a call. ifif he doesn't want to see you, fine, forget it. but if he does, then maybe you can work something out. hey, my old man here yet. no, no. come on in. look, uh, alex, i hope you don't mind me having this little family reunion here. you know, mal thought it would be a good idea for me and my father to meet on neutral territory. nick, let me tell you something, okay. this is our living room. switzerland is neutral territory. but, uh, listen, seeing as your father's coming over, andand he has thatthat lot full of used cars, wonder if you could mention to him that i just, i happen to be in the market for, uh, for a very reliable, i mean, i mean, bargainpriced, rock bottom, almost free jaguar. look, alex, alex, you don't understand. me and my old man, we don't get along. you know, i ain't got nothing to talk to him about. you don't know how lucky you are to have a dad who loves you. you know, a dad with class. a dad you can be proud of. turkey franks, anyone. i got turkey frank pt. i got turkey frank meatballs. and my personal favorite, turkey frank sinatra. you were saying, nick.  that's him. that's him. now wait a minute. don't get oh, my god, dad. now, just 'cause this man is on television is no reason to get crazy. dad. just act natural, all right. everybody, you hear me. just act natural. okay. okay, hey. okay, okay, okay, okay. stand back. i'm going to open the door now. are we greeting your father or molten lava. hey. hey.

happens to have a twin down at the lot, name of joann. joann recently passed her emissions test. joe, joe, joe, these people do not want to buy a car. hey, don't go nuts, okay. it's a reflex. i sell, i sell. huh. okay. uh, excuse me, uh, joe. yeah. uh, listen, i was just wondering. how much would a couple of classy girls like marie and, uh, and joann set a guy like me back. emotionally, i don't think i can bear to part with either one of them. but $7,000 might help me compensate for any severe separation anxieties. well, well, why don't we all sit down and, uh, get to know each other, huh. that's a good idea, nick. you always were the one with the brains in the family. howhow about an hors d'oeuvre, joe. oh, i don't mind if i do. oh, look at that, turkey franks. they're gorgeous. ah, if i have one, i got to have a million.  well, you came to the right house. look, joe, about this business proposition. uh, what i want to do is start a business later. the night is young. look, look,

not you. you see, that's just it. you know, you caught all the breaks. your dad's smart, your dad's intellectual, your dad's distinguished. oh, boy. 101 dalmatians.  did i miss any barking. you see,

beautiful time. no. no, i didn't have such a beautiful time at the fish shanty. as i remember, you met up with a couple of your buddies, uh, started drinking, and you had to have the waiter drive me home. it's funny. i don't remember it that way. well, that's the way it happened. look, why don't we forget talking about the good old days and, uh, talk about my art school, okay. well, you could talk about it over dinner. somehow, i lost my appetite. oh. uh, nick. hmm. i'll tell you what. tomorrow afternoon, come down to the lot. you tell me what your needs are, i'll make out a check for you.  boy, oh, boy, oh, boy. very clever indeed. you really pinned me to the wall on this one. uh, let's see what we have here. with the rebate, the dealer warranty, and no. oh, you get one cherry of a deal, my good friend, at 1,995. i beg to differ, my good friend. but the automobile in question, if squeezed into a glass of water, would produce a tangy and refreshing glass of lemonade. you insult me, my dear friend. and yet, i take no personal offense. the car does have a certain citrus quality which may be easier to swallow at the paltry price of 1,775. a good price and a wonderful year. hey. alex, what are you doing here. i'm trying to buy an automobile, but, uh, joe and i aren't seeing eyetoeye. careful, he's a snake. hey, don't worry, mal, i can take care of this guy. i was talking to joe. alex, i'll tell you what i want you to do. i want you to take her out for a test drive. i know you're going to love the way she handles. just don't turn right. ah. okay, nicky, what do you need. it's really great what you're doing for nick, joe. it really means a lot to him. here you go, son. $5,000. hey, uh, thanks, joe. i really appreciate this. uh, i'll make sure i get it back to you.
