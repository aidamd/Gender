"monsieur. " i love that. well, you take good care of her. i shall return. you are to be commended. he's been so beautifully brought up. it's almost as if he's a throwback to another era. turn of the century. there's something i must ask. i think i know what it is. elyse, nobody is more surprised about alex and me than i am. oh, i'm not too sure about that. my husband is gone, and alex has turned out to be a great companion for me. he's brought a certain joie de vivre that i don't think i've ever felt before. it's thrilling. that's the way joie de vivre is. lorraine i'm happy that you've had aa good experience you're a mother. you must know how i feel. let me assure you that i have no designs upon alex beyond friendship. lorraine, you've been frank with us, so we'll return the favor. we feel that you're simply too old for alex. well, ii'm sorry. it's nothing personal. he's letting his schoolwork slide. he doesn't see any of his old friends. we feel he should spend more time with someone his own age. well, you are his parents. and if you don't want me to see him, i will abide by your wishes. tthat doesn't mean you have to leave. i'm afraid it does. good night. steven, did we do the right thing. we had to do something. where's lorraine. she's gone. what do you what do you mean, she's gone. we told her how we felt. i'm afraid we hurt her feelings. oh we didn't mean for her to leave, alex. you know you didn't even give her a chance. you had no right to treat her that way. alex, we apologize. i'm very sorry. "sorry. " what good is sorry.. you know, i'm i'm a man. you have to treat me like a man. do you understand. you're gonna have to learn to let go. dinner is served. of course, we can keep it warm. be my lorraine hello. hi. do you have glen gray's casa loma orchestra playing "tuxedo junction". i'm only playing "sweet lorraine" tonight, sir. yeah, we're into the second hour of the first annual sweet lorraineathon. and here's the big band allstars of 1944, with their very special interpretation of "sweet lorraine.
