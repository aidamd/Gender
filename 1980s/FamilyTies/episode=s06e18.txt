 i bet we've been together for a million years and i bet we'll be together for a million more oh, it's like i started breathing on the night we kissed and i can't remember what i ever did before what would we do, baby, without us. what would we do, baby, without us. and there ain't no nothing we can't love each other through what would we do, baby, without us. no, no, see, this color's all wrong for you, andy. you must stay away from green. i'm not promising anything. you are a winter person. your colors are gray, blue, navy, azure. and you must stay away from plaids and avoid large prints whenever possible. hey, i came in here to eat. andy, i'm giving you a free color analysis. so. i don't even pick out my own clothes. hi. is your dad home yet. hi, mom. no. has he called. no, not yet. why. well, your father is down at the columbus community playhouse. they are considering putting on a play he wrote, and i'm just kind of anxious to see what the decision is. really. what's it about. well, it's a very autobiographical story about how we met and fell in love. there's some very nice moments from the '60s. a draft card for the burning by steven keaton. oh, wait a minute. "oh my diamond in the rough from buffalo, come let me love you. " wait a minute. wait a minute, wait a minute. i'vei've heard that before. wait a minute. oh. it's an old memory. it's an old, old memory. i'mi'm in my crib i'mi'm tossing, i'm turning it's a nightmare. it's dad's play. it's alive. there's a chance that the columbus community playhouse is gonna do it. they must be stopped. i think it's nice that it might be produced again. you mean it's been produced before. oh, yeah, when we were in college. your father directed and i had the lead the activistanthropology student sequoia free.  i'm telling you, the '60s were a joke. i mean, everyone was running around with these cartoon names. i wouldn't laugh if i were you. when you were a little baby, we called you "moon muffin. " he looks like a little moon muffin, doesn't he. yeah, well, it could have been worse. i could have been "moon muffin free. " i remember you telling us about this play. isn't it the one that almost broke you and dad up. yeah. itit did almost break us up. your father's whole personality just changed completely. he became insanely jealous about whoever played opposite me. he became extremely pompous and terribly theatrical. : yumdada, dadada, dum. "the columbus community theatre is proud to announce "the ohio debut of steven keaton's a draft card for the burning. " oh. congratulations. steven: well, thank you. it's going to be the first in their "undiscovered playwrights of ohio" series. i'm going to direct it, and, elyse, i want you to star in it. oh, it's so sweet of you to think of me i can't. why not. it'll be just like the old days. that's what i'm afraid of. ii know there was a little tension the last time we worked together, but it's all in the past. we're so much more mature now. anyway, it's only going to play two days. well, what two days do you have in mind. sunday and monday. oh, heartbreak. i'm not available. you don't even know which sunday and monday. well, itit doesn't really matter because i've just joined this group "sundays and mondays in ohio. " steven: well, um maybe we could move the play nights to tuesdays and wednesdays. no, no. don't do that, because "sundays and mondays" might be changing to "tuesdays and wednesdays. " well, i'm certainly not going to beg you.  i'm sure shakespeare had his rejections.  probably not from his wife, but i'll find another leading actress. this town must be full of sequoia frees. "we must turn back the tide of war. "lay bare the kelp of poverty and greed. "uncover in the seashells of human experience "man's more peaceful nature "as the waves wash onto the shore of life. " "oh, my diamond in the rough from buffalo, come let me love you. " steven: okay. very good. very, very good. carol, we'll let you know. okay. uh, steven, i just want you to know that i've done a lot of classic theater from ibsen to shaw and back again. and the role of sequoia free in a draft card for the burning is perhaps the most significant role written for a woman since joan of arc in joan of arc. i loved it too, steve. the moment i read it. i was in my office, just kicking back, after finishing a root canal. i picked it up i picked it up and couldn't put it down. it had fire. it had a jeff. jeff, please. you've already got the part. no, no, i mean it. it just rolls off the tongue. "kelp of poverty. " "seashells of experience. " do you like fish, steve.  hey, how's it going. it's tough, alex. why, dad having trouble finding any actors for his play. no, it's been tough on me sitting here listening to all this. i'm starting to see past lives and envying them. that tough, huh. have you read the whole play yet, alex. no, nobody's read the whole play. not even dad. why. have you. i tried, but i, i kept blacking out. ah, fine. if you just alex: hey, pop. pop. nice. i hear it's going like gangbusters. well, uh, the material's certainly holding up. the trick is to find actors of the same caliber. that's gonna be tough, dad. mmhmm. all right. let's, uh, let's get on with it. ready, alice. okey dokey. okay elyse: exactly what he did. i told you he did shh. shh. oh. oh. i'm sorry, steven, i didn't realize your auditions were still going on. we'll get out of your way. no, no. stay, elyse. stay and watch her butcher the dialogue meant to come only from your lips. anytime, mon capitan. okay, uh, jeff, alice, uh, let'slet's read a little. have fun with it, and, um begin.

"with the heat of love burning in his heart, randolph sweeps sequoia into a passionate embrace. " that's a throwaway. it's a matter of interpretation. oh. hm i think randolph's worn out. mm. tootoo tired and emotionally drained to do much more than shake hands with sequoia. iii wouldn't even go that far. make it a high five. a high five. that doesn't seem right. jeff, you're a dentist. what do you know about art. your area is pain. ii have to agree with jeff, honey. oh, do you, sequoia. well, whenwhen a man says, uh, "sequoia, darling, i love you with all my heart. come to me. i'm on fire" well, people expect them to kiss, you know, notnot just give a high five. oh, fine. let's just give the people what they expect. let's just give them what they're used to. "i love you. " kiss. "i love you. " kiss. you've seen it a million times. "i love you.
