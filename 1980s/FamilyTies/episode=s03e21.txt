greenhouse. seems they have more plants than friends. then then i came home, and alex and mallory were still arguing about some shirt, and and jennifer was on this sixhour phoneathon with chrissie. i think the high point of my day was when andrew spit up on me. well, at least we're alone now. yeah. oh, honey, it's just so nice to have a quiet moment with you. hello. uh, yes, she is. tell whoever it is i'll call 'em back tomorrow. uh, chrissie, my wife will call you back tomorrow. jennifer, telephone. thanks, mom. no, honey, get it downstairs. but, mom, chrissie talked to adam galardner today and asked him if he likes me. i just have to find that out. is there some reason why you can't find that out downstairs. okay. chrissie, call me right back, okay. i'm getting a lot of static on this end. thank you. hi. i just wanted you to know that alex and i have settled our argument about the shirt. you know, i washed it for him and everything's fine now. we won't be bothering you anymore.

you some pictures of little roger. wha. isn't he here. yeah, i know, but, uh, he's a little grumpy. don't look at him. he looks much better in the pictures. elyse, remember, we said we weren't gonna talk you have that picture of andy in the baseball cap. oh, there it is. are you ready to order. no, thanks. we've already ordered. oh. oh, well, of course. you haven't. i'm sorry. excuse me, enjoy your dinner. here, take the pictures with you. you'll love 'em. hey, here. llook at the ones of andy. oh, okay. sorry, steven. now, listen, elyse, this is exactly the kind of thing we said we were not going to do. you've gotta control yourself. you're right, sorry. it's out of my system. well, i hope so. let's just enjoy this time alone together. okay. excuse me. where are you going. uh, to the men's room. i'll be right back. oh. hi, jennifer. it's me. your father. um, yeah, well dinner's going fine. thank you. listen what. i don't care if you're expecting an important call. i will not keep it brief. listen, um, how's andrew. ooh, has he been sneezing at all. well, are you sure. because if his cold's acting up again, we can come right home. look, why don't you check on. no. no, i do not want a free dance lesson, and i'd appreciate it if you wouldn't interrupt my dinner in the future. i tried to be a nice guy by answering a pay phone, and look what happens. why did you hang up. i'm sorry. did you want a free dance lesson. well, how was andrew. he's fine. elyse, i think i figured out what went wrong tonight. oh. well, you see, it's very simple, really. see, we each have careers which take up a lot of our time and energy, and we have three children who are very wonderful, but, uh, who are also very loud and demanding. and on top of that, we have a baby who is, uh, very beautiful, but also very loud and demanding and who occupies every last moment of our remaining time and energy. tonight we tried to escape all that. and. it's impossible. that's encouraging. but it's true, elyse. uh, we can, uh, remove ourselves physically from all this, but, uh but not emotionally. this is our life. we're trapped in it. you make it sound like a sciencefiction film. it's not such a bad life, is it. no, it's not. it's a great life. oh. ii think we just have to accept the fact that our life has changed, that we're parents. we have fo four children, and we enjoy it. and we're not gonna have any fun till andrew goes to college. i accept that. hi. i just wanted to apologize for talking on the phone so much lately. it's okay, honey. for some reason, i find myself talking about boys a lot more than i used to. in fact, i find myself talking to boys a lot more than i used to. we've noticed. i'm sure it's just a phase. it'll pass. i'm not getting that. uh, if it's for me, tell whoever it is that i'll see him at school tomorrow. hello. well, no. no, i'm sorry, adam dad, no. hi, uh, adam. uh, can i call you right back. okay. bye. this is the last phone call i will ever make in my whole life. please. thanks. good night. hey, hey. how you doin'. oh, not bad. not bad. look, we know you guys haven't been able to spend a lot of time together and that we're probably part of the reason why not. right. so, uh, we just wanted to say we're sorry, and, you know, all that stuff. apology accepted, and all that stuff. and if andrew cries tonight, we'll take care of it. yeah. yeah. that's right. if, uh if andrew cries tonight, mallory will take care of it. right. it's too quiet, steven. oh, come on, elyse. let's enjoy this. this is what we wanted, isn't it. yeah. what do you want to do. i don't know. what do you want to do. well, i have a vague recollection of you and me being in bed together. oh, yeah, that. i think i remember. i think we're falling asleep, elyse. we're definitely falling asleep. i knew there had to be a catch. i love you. i love you too, honey. )
