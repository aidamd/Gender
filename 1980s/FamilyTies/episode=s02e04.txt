"the columbus express and the ed hanson agency "are pleased to announce that you've been selected "to be photographed in our annual mother/daughter modeling event. " i won. i won. oh. i'm gonna be in the sunday supplement. look, there's a chance for a professional modeling contract, a $250 prize. this could be my big break. how did you win a mother/daughter modeling contest by yourself. ever hear of mom. i sent in that great picture that dad took of us at the beach last summer. wait a wait wait wait a minute, mallory. uh, i was in that picture. i won. i won. i won the mother/daughter modeling contest. whoa. is that, like, $250 each. do we split that or what. no. relax, alex. i cut you out of the picture. i drew a a volleyball where your head was. mom hasn't said anything about this. that's because she doesn't know. it's a surprise. hey. hi. oh, mom. guess what. i won a mother/daughter modeling contest. i didn't know you'd entered. well, we did. and we won. isn't it great.. wait a minute. aare you saying you entered me in a contest without asking me. i didn't want to get your hopes up. this is the best thing that ever happened to me. isn't it great, mom. aren't you excited. she looks thrilled. alex a good model doesn't show her true feelings. she just smiles as if she doesn't have a thought in the world. then, uh, you should make a great model. thanks. ah. yo, "yennifer. " did you get that stuff i told you to get. uh yeah. except they didn't have that number two balsa wood you asked for. but the guy told me this stuff would work just as well. this. what is wrong with you, jennifer. we can't use this. that is the last time i send you to the lumberyard alone. don't deny her her childhood, alex. oh, hey. hey, that's a good idea, mallory. maybe some of it will leak into your brain. mother, i've been reading these modeling instructions. i've got it all planned out. i'll wear my white dress, and you can wear the black dress with the full sleeves. now, hold on, mallory. i told you i didn't like it when you entered me in the contest without my permission. i don't want to do this. why not. it's not something she wants to do. you know, that's funny, 'cause it says here mom's been working towards a modeling career her whole life. alex, give me that. no. mallory, i think it's important that mom read her own autobiography. wait what autobiography.. "after a hard day of shopping for sweaters "with my gorgeous daughter, mallory, "i hurry home to make sure "my husband's happy in his favorite chair with his robe, his slippers and his pipe". mallory, that's ridiculous. i don't smoke a pipe. get a load of mallory's biography. "i've always liked the simpler things in life children, rain, cashmere. " jennifer. mallory, it is unbelievable that you would do this. you're right, mom. i shouldn't have done it. it's just that i really wanted to win, and you were so busy, i didn't think it would hurt. i'm really sorry, mom. i was wrong. good. i'm i'm glad you can see that. i do. so will you do it. no. why not. i don't know. i i'd feel silly. are you saying i'm silly for wanting to do it. all of you think i'm silly, don't you. i do. thanks a lot, mom. oh, honey, don't oh, boy. she, uh, she seems upset. i better go talk to her. sometimes only a brother knows what needs to be said. modeling. pfft. i better go, too. sometimes only a sister knows what needs to be said. modeling. i'll have to fake it. elyse maybe you should think about giving in on this one. steven, she entered me in a contest without asking me. then then she wrote these phony biographies. okay. obviously, mallory's gotten carried away. but at least she she she's taking some initiative, showing some enthusiasm. i've always wanted her to care about something. i always hoped it'd be physics instead of fashion. well, they both start with a "fff" sound. i'm not a model, honey. models get so carried away with their outfits and and tossing their hair. it's just not me. it's just one day. it would mean so much to her. i guess it couldn't hurt. oh. man: beautiful, beautiful. i love it. who's the mother. who's the daughter. i can't tell the difference. this is great, mom. isn't this your idea of heaven. yeah, well, i always pictured a larger room. okay, mom, mallory. i'll be back in a couple of hours to pick you up. got

deliberately trying to throw me off. what. is that what you think i was doing in there. i just happened to be in the kitchen. i was minding my own business. oh, and in the middle of shooting, you just happened to yell, "run for your life. the house is on fire." slipped out. mallory, you're acting like a 9yearold. obviously, something is bothering you. please tell me what it is. all right, i'll tell you what's bothering me. i'm the one who wanted to be a model, and you stole that away from me. now i'll never be one. i didn't steal anything from you. if you hadn't been there, they would have chosen me to be the proper penguin lady. well, maybe not the proper penguin lady, but at least the proper penguin daughter. i didn't want to get into this to begin with. you dragged me into it. maybe so. but once you were there, you certainly enjoyed it. why does it matter so much to you that i enjoyed it. because you forgot about me. it's supposed to be my big, shining moment and everyone was shoving me aside. you didn't even care. it's like i didn't exist. honey, ii didn't realize i hurt you. yeah, you were too busy with your makeup and your lines and your penguin friends. you didn't have time for me. i always have time for you. i'm a mother first and a penguin lady second. don't tell your father. why did you do it, mom. you knew how important it was to me. i don't know. i guess i got carried away. all that fuss, all that aattention. it was flattering. i guess i just didn't stop to consider your feelings. everyone else has something they're good at. i just wanted to be good at something, too. honey, you're good at lots of things. oh. they're not the things that anyone thinks are important. sometimes i feel like such an outsider. honey, it's true, maybe, that that different things are important to you, but it shouldn't make them any less valuable. then why does everyone always make fun of the things that i like. if that's what's happening, i'm so sorry. we should be much more aware of your feelings. especially me. oh, honey. i should apologize, too. it was pretty childish of me to ruin your commercial. you were good, too. i would have been good, too, though. i mean, i have everyone's lines memorized. even sir penguin's. you did. i was tied up at work. traffic was awful. how am i supposed to cook an impressive meal for 8 important friends in 20 minutes. what about the proper penguin. well, thank you, sir penguin. well, hey. how'd the filming go. okay. just okay, and you're hugging like that. dad bowled a 200 game. you don't see me slobbering all over him. no. but you did spike the bowling ball. so, mom when's the next assignment. uh i'm not gonna do any more modeling. what. i thought you said it went okay. did they make you eat that penguin food. mom, get get ahold of yourself. we're talking about a lot of money here. some things are more important than money. name one. hello. oh. hello, ed. uh, yes well well, thank you, but i'm really not interested in doing any more modeling. but maybe my daughter is. she happens to be right here. now, hold on. just be relaxed. mom. calm down. be yourself. bonjour, douard. )
