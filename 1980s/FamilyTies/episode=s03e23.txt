"ve must to fatten you up, stevie," she would say. guess she'd be disappointed if she saw me now, huh. i don't know. i don't think anyone who saw you now would be disappointed. i didn't realize how special they were, elyse. sometimes i'd stop in to see them. sometimes i'd forget. it took so little for me to make them happy. i was so thoughtless about it. why didn't i realize. you were 10. it won't come again, elyse. the kretzers, that whole generation. what they did. to come to a new land. they didn't speak the language. they built a life. they were heroes, elyse. every last one of 'em. i couldn't find the time to have a glass of milk with them. steven, stop it. you were a kid. kids don't think about things like that. the world will last forever. it'll never change. you'll always be 10. they'll always be 75. they'd be 109 now, i guess. maybe i should give them a call. they're probably not up. a lot of ghosts here, elyse. come on. let's go to bed. you go. i'll be up in a minute. yeah. don't forget to eat your cookies, okay. okay.
