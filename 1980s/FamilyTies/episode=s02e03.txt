ddo you mean an affectionate little tap, like, uh, "way to go, mr. tedesco". i decked him. wow. wow. any particular reason. he shoved an elderly lady. that's it.. how old. alex, your mr. tedesco is a rude, crass, vile human being. i could have told you that. what did you have to hit him for.. he was being so rude and insulting that that hitting him was an automatic reflexive response. i was seized by an uncontrollable impulse. can't you understand.. no. it was just one of those things. now, iii'm sure we can all understand it. could you explain it to me one more time, elyse. maybe if you showed us how it happened, mom. alex, you be mr. tedes steven, i'm so ashamed of myself striking another human being. well, look, elyse, i'm sure that this can all be cleared up cleared up very easily. now, why don't you just call him up and apologize. good idea, good idea. i'll get the number. everything is going to be fine. you just had a bad night, that's all. yeah. champ. that's right, mom. and anyways, mr. tedesco's been asking for it for a long time now. it's time somebody put him in his place. mallory, i don't want you to interpret this in any way as meaning that i condone violence. i don't. it was a freak occurrence. mmm. okay, mom. here you go. say anything you have to say. but get me that recommendation. don't worry, alex. i think i know how to handle this. hello. mr. tedesco. hi. this is elyse keaton. please, please. hear me out. mr. tedesco, ii feel terribly about what happened, and and i want to apologize. now, see here. what. where do you live. ww uh, mmmr. tedesco. uh, yeah, pay no attention to her. sshe's been on medication lately, and hello. hello. uh, mr. tedesco. what is it. may i have a word with you. you've already had seven. i'm steven keaton, alex's father. huh. one of the dueling keatons. no, ii don't don't come any closer. mr. tedesco, i came to apologize for my wife's behavior. she feels terrible about the whole thing. she's really sorry. we both are. i could sue, you know. look, uh, look, lllet's let's try to gain some perspective on the situation here. uh, haven't you ever done something without thinking something you regretted later. yes. i showed up for parents night. look, look, i know you're upset, and you have every right to be, but you're obviously a very intelligent, civilized person who can recognize this incident for what it is. an aberration. and, uh, i hope you'll forgive and forget. fortunately, mr. keaton, your son inherited your rational temperament. for his sake, i will allow myself to be appeased by your words. i am nothing if not civilized. well i can see that. your wife, however, is an amazon. part irish, part french. no amazon. you know what i mean, keaton. she's primal. not fully evolved. you must have a tough time keeping her in line. tell me do whips ever enter the picture. i think i'll be going now. no, i'm curious what's it like to live with that kind of unbridled shedevil. goodbye, mr. tedesco. no, wait. just one more question. does she ever, uh. why, you you're in a good mood, alex. hey, why shouldn't i be in a good mood. right now, dad and mr. tedesco are probably shaking hands. they're probably deciding whether or not to go out for a beer. my problems are over. hey, mom, want to go for a few rounds, just for old times' sake. alex. float like a butterfly, sting like a bee. alex, i'm getting angry. whoa. kids, she's mad. hit the deck. aah. will you stop it.. just get the table set for dinner. ah, come on, mom. it's over now. we can laugh about it. can't we. she's not laughing, alex. okay, okay. what's this. it's a plate. it use to be a plate. now it's art. there's lots more art in the cupboard, mom. well, dad, how'd it go. will he write me the recommendation. well, we didn't exactly discuss the recommendation. well, what did you talk about. well, um first, i introduced myself. then, ii told him how sorry we were. i convinced him to forgive and forget. then we made a little bit of small talk, idle chatter. then i punched him in the face. i'm sorry, alex. the man is slime. elyse, if you'd heard the things he'd said i can't believe this. i can't let you two out of the house. alex, that man would have made a killer out of gandhi. that man held the key to my future in his hands. that that letter of recommendation wwas my passport to the ivy league, tto penny loafers, raccoon coats girls named muffy. alex, there's always trade school. ohh. how did all this happen, elyse. for all these years, we've lived by the doctrine of nonviolence, of sympathy and love towards our fellow man, peace and harmony. the man is a rodent. listen, my geography teacher has been wising off lately. could one of you rough her up a bit. we've got to put a stop to this. steven, i know this may sound crazy, but i think we ought to invite mr. tedesco to dinner tomorrow night. what for. to finish him off. i don't want that man in my home, elyse. neither do i, steven, but until we can sit down in peace with him, we'll never be able to sit down in peace with ourselves. you're right. and i think we owe it to alex to smooth this thing over. well now you're talking some sense. it's settled. we'll invite him for dinner tomorrow night. girls, you got to help me out tonight. we got to keep things in an up mood when mr. tedesco comes happiness, gaiety. laugh and giggle as much as possible. in fact, let's practice, okay. go ahead laugh. heh. that's not bad, not bad, but try it with a little more enthusiasm. hee hee hee hee hee. hee hee hee hee hee. better. okay, look, uh if he starts getting into it with mom and dad, talk about something else, okay. like like the weather. okay, alex, now, the chicken's in the oven, and the table is set. uh, chicken. chicken. is that the best you could do, mom. what's wrong with chicken. you do not appease a man with poultry. beef. we need beef. we're having chicken, alex. okay, look, i've given some thought aas to what you might say to mr. tedesco. "never has so cruel an attack been perpetrated on so innocent a victim. " "would that i could reverse the hands of time, i would. i beg your forgiveness with all my heart and soul". alex, we're not gonna say these things. we had no right to hit him. we know that. but we're not going to beg his forgiveness. begging's out. afraid so. we're not gonna grovel, either. no groveling, either. why are we having the guy over. i'll get it. mr. tedesco. hello, alex. come on in. please sit down. thank you. hee hee hee hee hee. hee hee hee hee hee. i'm glad you could accept our invitation, mr. tedesco. well, of course he accepted, mom. he's a very forgiving man. before you sits a human being who thinks and acts on the highest plane imaginable. i came for the free dinner. hee hee. hee hee. mr. tedesco, why don't we start with a clean slate here. now, we're all reasonable, intelligent human beings who have just behaved poorly over the past few days. now, i know my husband and i are sorry for hitting you, and i'm sure that you're sorry for saying the things you said. what's for dinner. chicken. but before we eat, i was hoping that i had chicken for lunch. mom, there's got to be something else in the fridge. maybe we can go out and eat. uh, no, alex. we are staying here. and we're eating chicken. i said i had chicken for lunch. um they say it might rain. yeah. rain's good. now, that's the mallory i remember. mr. tedesco steven. ii think i need some help in the kitchen with the chicken. we'll help too, mom. good. it's a big chicken. sorry about that, mr. tedesco. it's about what i expected. look, uh there's no point in going on with this charade any longer. you're not gonna write that letter of recommendation for me, are you. uh are you. you know, keaton this is one of those moments when i prize being a teacher when i can watch a student squirm because i hold his fate in my hands. you like that, huh. i do. i do. there's something very appealing about playing god. that's how we think of you. i love having power. and it's inspiring to see that you don't abuse it. uh, look i really need that recommendation. i know. okay, okay, okay. you've suffered long enough. you got the recommendation. uh ii do. yeah wrote it the day you asked me for it. it's right here. i don't usually show letters of recommendation to students, but this one's exceptionally wellwritten, and well here you go. ohh. oh, mr. tedesco. oh, this is beautiful. this is beautiful. thank you. i admit that i thought about not giving you a recommendation. then i realized that wouldn't be fair. it wasn't you that hit me. uh, no, no, no, it wasn't. it's not your fault your parents are the way they are. you know, in fact, considering what your parents are like, you're a remarkable fellow. yeah. now, when they came into the classroom, i realized that evolution sometimes takes a detour. we're all descended from apes, but not quite as directly as you. mr. tedesco sorry about flying off the handle earlier. my, uh, my wife and i were talking out there, and we reminded each other what this evening is all about and how much it means to this family. yes. we're defrosting some steaks. should be ready in about 20 minutes. yummy. no, mom. no steaks tonight. tonight we're having chicken. no, alex, remember. mr. tedesco had chicken for lunch. yeah, well, i don't care what mr. tedesco had for lunch, and, uh, this is what i think of his recommendation. alex, what are you doing.. i'm keeping my selfrespect. i overrated you, alex. i thought you were better than your parents. i was wrong. look, mr. tedesco, ii don't feel like i'm better than my parents. as a matter of fact, if i grow up to be as good as they are, i'll be very proud. how conventionally sweet. ooh. i think we'd all appreciate it if you left our house now, mr. tedesco. my pleasure. whoa. nice going, alex. you should've punched him. no, he shouldn't have. i think you handled the situation just right. look, i know it wasn't easy for you guys to invite him over here for dinner tonight, and i know you did it for me. thank you. the evening didn't end up the way we thought it would, but at least nobody got hit. alex, you're hard to figure. right when i think i know you, you go and do something nice. all right. i'll have the chicken. )
