you're the beautiful damsel in distress. and i am a knight. you are an idiot. well, what about that window. it leads to the backyard, doesn't it. yeah, it's nailed shut. well, at least no one can break in. we're stranded here and no one's gonna be here till the morning. we don't even have anything to eat. oh, but that's where you're wrong, mallory. look at this. what is that. it's a package of

me let me take a look at it. see, if this were my hair dryer, what would i do. you'd be drying your hair with a fuse box. wait, what if i took this one out of here uh, mallory, i i wouldn't do that. don't. and put it into here. that's very nice. we can see each other again. i'm so grateful. skippy, look, the only way we're gonna get out of here is the window. there must be some way to open it. all right, all right, let me, uh, have a look at it now. move this. stand back. mallory, this may be the last time we ever see each other. good. here i go. uh, okay. all right. i got it open. oh, boy. well, there's plenty of snow here if we need it. there. can you get out, skippy. no, i'm sorry. there's no way i can fit through the bars. maybe if i buttered myself. oh oh, great. now the window's

to find something to keep my damsel warm. there's gotta be something what. what did you say was in this trunk. uh, it's just alex's old junk. mallory, there are clothes in here. we can put them on and be warm. oh, great, skippy. nice going. oh, don't thank me. that's what us knights are for. it's too bad the babies are still asleep. mmm. i wonder if larry jr. is asleep. he looks so cute when he's sleeping. remember, suzie. well, you know, it it is great getting together like this. i i was just, uh, saying to elyse on the drive over here that we really don't know each other that well. no. i don't mean that she and i don't know each other that well. i i, uh, meant all of us. oh. that's true, you know, during the lamaze classes, we didn't have much of a chance to socialize, but but now we can just sit back and relax and talk. that's right. right. hey, and talk about something other than babies. what a relief. finally. so, what'd you guys think of that election. oh. oh, boy, we're pretty upset, let me tell you. who wants another four years with that guy. we think he's doing a fine job. that's right. i, uh well, i don't follow politics. heh. heh. then why did you bring it up, larry. oh, i was just trying to make conversation. i mean, let's face it, this party's dying. are you sure this goes on this way. i'm positive. well i certainly am warm now, huh. we're lucky that your parents like to get dressed up like chipmunks. skippy, i told you it was for a halloween party. it's a good thing they didn't go as nudists. i can't believe this. i don't mind freezing to death half as much as the thought of being found looking like this. what are you doing. i'm looking for something to eat. i have a sudden craving for chestnuts. "my summer vacation by alex p. keaton, "age 6. "this summer, i went to the zoo. "it only cost 50 cents because i am a minor. "it cost my parents $1 because they are majors.
