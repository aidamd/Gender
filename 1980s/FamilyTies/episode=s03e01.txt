wanna comb your hair. look, mom. tom jones is appearing in this very hotel. oh, maybe we can see his show. better yet, i might see him in the lobby or something. room service, please. jennifer, i thought we made it clear, we have to economize this trip. no room service. we don't need room service, jen. it's so expensive. we can eat great and save a small fortune with this coupon book the travel agency sent. look at this: breakfast for the five of us, all you can eat for $1. 50. this says we have to eat breakfast between 3:30 and 4:00 in the morning. it'll work out fine. look. we'll set the alarm for 3:15. we'll wwe'll go downstairs and eat a huge breakfast, and if we really wolf it down, you'll be back in your bed by 4:00. okay, guys and dolls, i have condensed the entire alex keaton blackjack system into 98 simple steps. here you go, mom. alex, i do not want to spend my weekend sitting in some dark, smoky room with some desperate, driven gamblers just obsessed with the idea of making a few miserable bucks by the luck of the draw. why not. oh, my god. there he is. that's tom jones. look. look. that is not tom jones, mallory. i think i know what tom jones looks like, jennifer. thank you. then why is he getting into the city bus. maybe he wants to go somewhere. you ever think of that. he's getting into the driver's seat, mallory. well, that doesn't prove anything, jennifer. give it up, mallory. look, what do you say we all go for a walk on the boardwalk, huh. down on the boardwalk out of the sun under the boardwalk we'll be having fun wait. wai wait a minute.

you quit bothering me, alex. you're not even supposed to be in here. henry. henry, uh, would you come over here, please. there's someone underage bothering the players. never mind, mom. come on, eddie. deal. elyse, i'm taking the girls upstairs. wha. oh ss what. who is it. it's me, alex. alex, what time is it. threethirty. i couldn't sleep. guess you couldn't either, huh. i might have dozed for a minute. what's going on. nothing. dad and i couldn't sleep. guess you guys couldn't either, huh. not since you got here. hasn't mom come back yet, at all. nope. i went down to the casino about two hours ago, she was still playing. you know, dad, uh i kind of feel responsible for this. if i hadn't pushed you and mom so hard to gamble, none of this would have happened. it's not really your fault, alex. yeah. you're right. mom went nuts. elyse. uh, ii didn't expect you'd all be up. we couldn't sleep. just come from the casino. i left the casino about an hour ago. the bottom fell out, steven. i see. so, uh ii took a stroll along the boardwalk. under the boardwalk you'll you'll forgive me if i'm not in the mood for a singalong right now. i i forgive you. i'm sorry, honey, but i saw this coming. you got seduced by the thrill of getting rich quick, and you totally lost all perspective, you fell right into their trap. you win big for awhile, but inevitably the odds catch up with you. so how much did you lose. oh steven i won almost $2,000. hello. mallory, if i'm dreaming, please don't wake me up. you have my word. elyse, i don't get it. you said th the bottom falling out. it did fall out, steven. an hour ago, ii was sitting at that table, and i'd just won my 18th consecutive hand. and the dealer handed me a stack of chips that big. there was more money than i'd ever seen in my life before. and at that moment, i never felt more empty or alone in my life. you weren't alone. you had the chips. th th then i tried to think about what this weekend was supposed to mean. the conference, for one thing. you know, ii had an opportunity to to present an exciting and innovative paper to my fellow architects. a paper i'd spent months preparing. and i gave it all away. and then i i thought about you guys and how i'd ignored you and mistreated you. i just turned away from my family so that i could win more money. it's okay, honey. it's okay. mom what you did was terrible. we're rich. we're rich. it was so scary, steven. the only thing i lived for was my next blackjack hand. let's just call it temporary insanity. i'm glad it's all over. mom, you look awful. let's get some room service up here, and then we'll all feel a lot better. yeah, jen. do you want to call or should i. no. no. no room service. why not, mom. we're rich. yeah no, see, you don't understand. we are not rich. we are not even welltodo. come on, mom. uh, we are not high rollers like you are. to us, 2000 bucks is rich. no, but you see, this money isn't ours anymore. what do you mean. well, after i left the blackjack table, ii put the money in the hotel safe and i went for a stroll on the boardwalk. and about a mile away i found a midnight mission, and i went in, and i pledged $2000 to them. all of this. no. this is 1800. we owe the other 200. let me see if i hear you correctly, elyse. you won $1800 playing blackjack, and we are in debt for $200 to the midnight mission. that's right. we're poor. we're poor. okay. okay, let's not panic here. i don't think any pledge made at 3:30 in the morning is legally binding in the state of new jersey. it is binding, alex, because i pledged it. they don't know you here, mom. we can put a fake mustache on ya and sneak you across the state line. you make a father proud, alex. don't you see. ii had to do this. ii had to do something to get rid of that terrible feeling that i had. if if i kept this money, i'd have never felt good about myself again. this is tainted money. there is no such thing as tainted money, mom. alex, that's enough. i hope you all understand. we do, elyse. if you felt that strongly about it, then giving away that money was absolutely the right you gave it all away. you did the right thing. you did the right thing. right, kids. we're with you, mom. yeah. is the mission still open. 'cause i could go over there and talk to the guy. you did the right thing, mom. i love you all so much. i'm still hungry. do you still have those coupons, dad. )
