what time are you going out. just under three hours. if you hurry, you'll make it.     i'm sorry, alex. ii just ii didn't know anybody was in there. oh, hey, the shower curtain was closed. tthe water

uh, yeah. this is my robe, all right. alex, i'm shocked. doesn't look like the start of the world's most wholesome date to me.    hey, this is, uh, quite a place. don't you think. uh, it's everything i thought it would be, alex. where's donny and marie. hi. i'm your waitress sherry. hi. i'm your customer alex.  uh, this is carrie. oh, wow. sherry and carrie. isn't that cute. our names almost rhyme. it's staggering. i imagine the odds. ah. so, what will the gang be having. uh, two apple pie and two glasses of milk. no, wait. actually, make that one glass of milk two straws. uh, i hope i'm not being too forward. you cad.  i'll be right back.  don't miss me.  we won't. you know, it's really nice to be here with you, carrie. thank you. it's nice to be with you, alex. i waskind of hoping we could go somewhere with a little more ambience. more romantic. more intimate, maybe some candlelight. uh, there's candlelight right over there. happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you happy birthday, dear leonard happy birthday to you  alex, would you say that i've been a pretty good sport tonight. uh, yeah. yeah, i guess so. did i complain when you took me to the bingo finals at the senior citizens' home. no. did i complain when we went to the immigration center to watch new citizens being sworn in. no. alex, let's get out of here. come on. we could go skydiving, horseback riding, dancing. i know a great club and a really hot band. i want to get crazy with you, alex. don't you want to get crazy with me. yeah. ii mean, no. no. no. we can't. why not. because it defeats the whole purpose of this night. we can have fun without having fun. alex, you can't tell me this is a normal date for you. the purpose of tonight was not to have a normal date. well, you've succeeded there. this is not the alex that i wanted to go out with. my alex made me laugh. he made me feel special. and i could make him laugh and feel special. where is he tonight. that that alex has no place here. i'm here instead. carrie, i'm worried about you. what are you talking about. you know what i'm talking about. i'm talking about the the way you act, the the way you dress, the way you talk. you don't act like a girl should act. yyou should be more like sherry. what is wrong with sherry. you put a brain in that head, you got a real special girl. so that's what tonight was all about. you were trying to show me how to be a good little girl. carrie, you've got to settle down before you do some damage. i just want you to have some pride, some selfrespect. i just want you to see that there are other options. you're right. there are other options. and i'm going to exercise one of them right now. see you 'round, alex. oh, hi, alex. hi, dad. up kind of late, aren't you.  to be honest, uh, i'm waiting up for mallory. i know it's oldfashioned, but, uh, every time she goes out with a new boy, i can't help worrying a little. i didn't know that. that's because i usually worry upstairs. there's a lot more to worry about with girls than with boys, isn't there. not more worries just, uh, different ones. but you would say that a girl has to be more careful than a guy. you know, worry more about her reputation, her demeanor, the way she acts in public. where's carrie. she walked out on me. all i was trying to do was help her, and that's the thanks i get. maybe she didn't want to be helped. maybe she's, uh, happy the way she is. well, maybe she's happy with it, but i'm not.  i guess that's the real problem, isn't it. mmhmm. why am i driving myself crazy. i mean, she's not gonna change. not likely. ii guess i better just forget about her, huh. that would solve the problem. yeah. you're right. it would. thanks, dad. good night. good night, alex. why do i have to be the one to change. because you want to be with her. you know what i feel like when carrie and i are together. ii feel like an astronaut who never went through the training program. i'm out there in some other world, and i don't even know how to fly the ship. well, then, uh you were lucky to be with someone who does. yeah. guess you're right. i am lucky. it's pretty amazing out there. i know. i married an astronaut myself. uh, dad if, uh, boys and girls are supposed to be treated the same, how come you're waiting up for mallory. 'cause you're already home. uh, well, uh  think i'll finish my waiting upstairs. i just want to say right off, i don't know why i came back. i think i do. you wanted to tell me what a jerk i was, hhow rude i was, how obnoxious, presumptuous, manipulative. keep going. i think you're onto something. carrie, ii am sorry. boy, this evening really backfired. i wanted to reform you, to turn you into a real lady, and instead instead what. i think maybe you already are a lady. it's just that yyou're a different kind of lady from the kind of lady that i think about when i think about the word "lady. " alex, what if i decided to become the good little girl you want me to be. do you really think either of us would be happy with that. i don't know. carrie, we're so different. why do we like each other so much. because we are so different. because we see in each other something we don't see in ourselves. and that's what it's always been about, alex. what are we gonna do. what we want to do.  i'm glad i asked. will you go out with me tonight. i already did. no, no, no. i mean, again. it's still early. i know a real romantic place. great ambience. sounds nice. )
