" you know what really worries me. matt pearson. oh, yeah, well, he's been on everyone's mind. who is he. sales rep for pbs. big, brash, full of life kind of guy. huge fan of my documentaries. i think his favorite was probably the salmon: from river king to croquette. well, he sounds like one of our kind of people. anyway, six months ago, he doesn't show up for the annual sales meeting. and, uh, i ask about him. turns out he's had a heart attack. he's five years younger than me, elyse. i saw him recently. completely different guy. he looked terrible. thin, tired, skittish. scared of living. told me his doctor said he was as good as new. he could do anything. but he's afraid. afraid he's gonna get another heart attack. are you afraid. i am. afraid of becoming another matt pearson. a living, passionless ghost. i need passion in my life, elyse. passion for the kids, passion for my work passion for you. honey it's all still there. it's just gonna take some time. i'm just thrilled with every minute i have with you. i love you. i love you. on second thought, i don't think we're gonna have to worry about that passion coming back. vavavavoom. sit, ubu, sit. good dog. )
