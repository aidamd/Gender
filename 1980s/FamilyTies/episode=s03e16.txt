"ha, ha." you laugh defiantly, refusing to be silenced. slow down. alex, there are other station managers who are experienced at this sort of thing. i'm just not in their league. dad, look. aat the continental congress in 1776, thomas jefferson was a young guy. an unknown face in the crowd, a complete nobody, just like you. and, uh, when john adams asked him to write the declaration of independence, he must've been a little overwhelmed, just like you are. but he said yes. thomas jefferson was a great man, alex. i'm not a great man, i'm steven keaton. dad, thomas jefferson wasn't thomas jefferson until he was thomas jefferson. you know. he didn't know he was gonna be thomas jefferson. i mean, one day he was thomas jefferson, and the next day, he was i know. thomas jefferson. yeah. look. great events make great men. thomas jefferson say that. uh, no. idid. heh. see, dad, if if thomas jefferson had given in to his fears, if he hadn't written the declaration of independence, they would've got somebody else. somebody less brilliant. somebody less eloquent. yeah, and without this masterpiece, dad, the revolution might never have succeeded. hediddo a nice job on it. yeah, dad. you see, it was jefferson's destiny to write the declaration of independence. just like it's your destiny to go to washington and testify. how do you know so much about people's destiny. that'smydestiny. alex, i appreciate what you're saying. i i really do. but i'm just gonna have to go with my instincts on this one. i'm not going to testify. dad no. i'll see you in the morning, son. yeah. try to get some sleep. alex. come on, alex, wake up. we got a lot of work to do. what. what. we gotta clean up in here, and then we gotta go clean the stable. stable. stable. what are you

sir. no, skippy, wha. what year is it. skip oh. it's 1776. whoa. i'm not used to it, either. you know, i'm still writing 1775 on my checks. good day, mr. jefferson, sir. hello, skipford. oh, young boy stable boy. uh, me. i just saw my horse tied to the post outside. now, i've asked you numerous times to please put him inside the stable when it rains. the rain can damage his coat. oh, thomas, i'm glad you're still here. oh, hello, john. good evening, mr. adams, sir. thomas, i just did some informal polling of the other delegates, and i think the vote tomorrow is going to go our way. independence from england. it'll be quite a day, john. yes, it will. and the delegates also agree that you're the man to write the document which officially declares our independence from the king. will you do it. skippy, pay attention. you are about to witness one of the greatest moments in the history of mankind. never mind that. betsy ross' window shade is up. i am very honored to be asked to write this declaration, john, but my answer is no. oh, come now, thomas. you're the finest writer amongst us and the most eloquent of thought, i daresay. why, just the other day, you impressed us all so much with your talk about the natural rights of man, about liberty and selfgovernment. that. that was nothing, john. i'd had a few glasses of ale, that's all. come now, thomas. this is no time for false modesty. i'm not being modest. i just have a lot to do tonight. i'm having my wig fluffed. what about john hancock. he's very good. he writes in those nice big letters. very easy to read. if you don't change your mind by morning, i'll ask him. well, i think he's your man. come on, john. i'll walk you to your horse. wait skippy. thomas jefferson isn't gonna write the declaration of independence. let's get busy. skippy, lookit, you don't understand. without jefferson's brilliance in that document, the revolution against england will fail. so what. i like england. no, look. skippy, uh i gotta do something. uh, do you know where jefferson lives. i live next door to the jeffersons. all right. take me there. no. uhuh, alex. don't get me involved in this. i'm in enough trouble already for cracking that stupid bell. look, skippy the history of the nation, perhaps of mankind, depends on what we do in the next couple of hours. oh, great. oh, hello there, mrs. jefferson. skipford. wipe your feet. oh, i'm sorry. uh this this is my friend alex. he works with me down at the statehouse. he'd like to talk to mr. jefferson. alex. what a nice name. well, my husband's upstairs. won't you come in and wait. yeah. ooh. young man, you're not well. you should have yourself leeched. say there, mallory. i happen to have a couple of tickets to the turkey shoot this sunday. are you interested. this very cute minuteman asked me today. oh, yeah. well, this guy may be a minuteman, mallory, but but someday you'll see. i'm gonna be an indentured servant. ha. mother, what's for dinner. uh, turtle and flummery pie. again. good thing we only eat thrice a day. let's eat. tom, dinner's ready. and you have company. honey, i can't find my dressy britches.

sir. it's very important. can't it wait until tomorrow. dinner's ready, and i hate cold turtle and flummery pie. uh, no. no, sir, it can't. uh listen, you have to write the declaration of independence. i mean, only you can make it bold enough and and thoughtprovoking enough to convince the nation that the revolution is a just cause. oh. and how does a stable boy such as yourself come to know so much of these matters. i'm a history buff. uh, sir, look. i i know what you're thinking. uh it's only natural that you'd be overwhelmed by this. i am not overwhelmed. i just have a lot to do. a good wigfluffing takes time. destiny is calling you. answer the call. you are a great man. i am not a great man. i'm just a farmer from virginia. i'm just thomas jefferson. what have i ever done that was great. well, for one thing, you, uh you got your picture on the $2 bill. uh, you see this will be the first thing. uh, don't you get it. great events make great men. ah. who said that. i did. well, i haven't yet, but i i will. uh mr. jefferson, take my word for it. this is a big career move for you. tom. your dinner is on the table. i'm going to be skipping dinner, martha. but you love turtle and flummery pie. not every night, dear. uh, and that that's not the reason. i i have some work to do. i'm gonna take a crack at this independence thing. uh, declaration. declaration of independence. i guess you just have to get these silly things out of your system. all right. all right, young man, you've convinced me. now, be on your way so i can get to work. oh, sir, please. can't i can't i just watch you. i mean, uh, you know, it'd mean a lot for me to see this. i mean, more than you could even imagine. you want to watch me write. yes, sir, and and i'll be real quiet. i, uh,

the matter. i am stuck on this one phrase. we have the right to govern ourselves in order to protect our most fundamental human rights. the existence of these rights is so obvious as to not require any further justification. how do i say that. uh, may i make a suggestion. no. we hold these truths to be pretty darn clear. no, that's no good. uh, we hold these truths to be obvious, even to a big dope. oh, no, no. this is so frustrating. these truths are selfevident. how do i say that. just like that. just, uh just, uh like that. like, "we hold these truths to be selfevident. " well, i'll put that down for now. otherwise, we'll be here all night. "that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights. " i should probably list a few. and among these are life, liberty uh life, liberty and maybe just life and liberty. uh, no. uh no. no. sir, it can't be just life and liberty. it's gotta be: life, liberty and the of the what of what. it'll come to you.
