to do. well, uh, for now, all we can do is keep track of the contractions. see how far apart they are. and that'll let us know how soon the baby's gonna come. i got it, mom. i bet these are the first contractions ever to be timed on a duran duran watch. it's same as any other watch, mallory. see, when the big duran's on the 9 and the little duran's on the 8 here, elyse. i brought you ice water. oh, thank you, gus. oh, elyse. thanks to you, we've set an alltime record for pledges. over $70,000. you know, robert mathison says he'll pledge $1,000 if you'll have a boy. what do you think of that, huh. well, i i'll do my best. oh, thank you. but i've gotta get back. mom. hhow can you be so calm. you are about to have a baby in a in a nonmedical, nonprofessional nonprofit environment. well, it it could be worse, honey. it if ii'm in a familiar setting, i i'm surrounded by my family. sure, my husband's not here, but got a picture of him. oh. ccontraction. uh, mallory, jennifer, how how far apart are they. uh, about 3 feet. no. i meant the contractions. they're about oh. ten minutes. uh, 10 minutes. mom. do you know what this means. what does this mean. alex, listen. please. i'm depending on you. i need you, all right. all right. jennifer, mallory, find gus. tell him we need some blankets, sheets, towels and hot water. oh, and, uh, they do a medical show, right. oh on stage 2. they got a gurney down there. find some guys in the crew and bring it up here, okay. okay. hey, you could use this to time mom's contractions. see, when the big duran's on the 8 and the little duran's on the 7 jennifer. and the je uh, i'll use my own watch, okay. it's got numbers. okay, mom i'm gonna stay here with you. now, that's more like it. i'm calm. we're organized. i feel better already. okay. changed your mind yet. need an expert. well, i i think i'm well within my rights not to be examined by a botanist. young lady, the reproductive processes can be remarkably similar in totally different species. when were you last watered. uh, doc uh, doc, thanks thanks very much for your concern. and, uh, we appreciate it, but we really don't think there's anything you can do to help. okay, okay. i'm leaving. good luck, mrs. keaton. try to keep her near the window. make sure she gets plenty of sunlight. hello. oh, honey, thank goodness you called. where are you. i need you. you are. well, uh i'll i'll do my best, but they're you will. okay, sweetheart. i love you. okay, bye. who was that. that was your dad. oh. he's on his way here with dr. alexander. aand skippy and the plumber are with him. oh, what a relief. for a second there, i thought the plumber wasn't gonna make it. i'm not even sure that they'll make it. he he called from a payphone. he said that the traffic and that the storm is terrible. well, uh, here. well, i'm i'm here with you, mom. i gotta admit it, alex. i'm getting a little scared. yeah. well, uh, mom i know exactly how you feel. well, not exactly. but, uh i know this can't be easy for you. this is not the way it's supposed to be. there's supposed to be a doctor here. there's supposed to be a husband here. there's supposed to be a hospital here. uh, look, mom i'm sorry that i panicked earlier. it it's just that i don't know, whenever there's a problem or or a crisis of some kind, it's always you or dad who handle it. i mean, this is a new world for me. well, it suits you, honey. thanks, mom. well, uh, you've done this birth thing before, so you just tell me what you need. well, for now, uh all i need is for you to be supportive, comforting and strong. and if there's time, go to medical school. bud, when do you think we'll get there. well, mr. keaton, we're doing 2 miles an hour. the next exit is three miles down the road. by my best calculations, we should get there, uh thursday friday by the latest. ah. oh, great. now we're not even moving. dr. alexander, what if we can't get there in time. all i can say, steven, is i mean, it's not ideal, but billions of women have given birth without a doctor's aid. it's a completely natural function, and your wife is a very healthy woman. there's every reason to believe that she'll be fine. thank you, doc. i feel better. clear the road. we're having a baby. it's no use. oh, mr. keaton, you gotta calm down. you heard what the doctor said. mrs. keaton's gonna be fine. everything's gonna be okay. your wife don't need you hanging around while she's having that kid. yeah. heck, my wife had six kids without me. well, you know what i mean. bud, i i know it's possible for her to have a baby if i'm not there. but elyse and i are a team. we, uh wanna bring this baby into the world together. after all, moments like this don't happen every day. this'll probably be the last baby we ever have. i i just wanna be there with her. clear the road. get out of the way. get out of the way. okay, mom. got everything. got the towels, the sheets, the hot water. i asked around for lollipops, but the best i could do was a sixpack of bud and some chewing tobacco. i'll take the tobacco. is there anything else, mom. well okay, i'd really like to lie down now. could you check on the gurney. well, i'll get it, mom. uh, jen, why don't you and, uh, two durans come with me. hey. try not to have the baby until i come back. okay, mom. all right. you're gonna do great. i know you are. thank you, honey. uh oh. you're really having the baby. yeah. you know, for the first time, it's starting to seem real to me. you're not the only one. you know, when i think of having babies myself someday, i get real nervous. what makes you nervous. oh. i don't know. everything about it. i mean, how do you know what to do when the baby won't fall asleep. well, you just you follow your instincts. well, how do you know what to do when the baby won't stop crying. well, you'll know when it happens. i mean, i don't even know what to say when your baby tells you she's old enough to stay out past midnight. forget it, mallory. thought i could slip that by you. no. oh, mom, you're gonna be a terrific mother for this baby. mm. and i know that if i have kids someday, if i turn out to be a great mother, it's 'cause i had a great mother like you. thank you, sweetheart. here you go, elyse. everything you need to become a new mother. except the baby. you have to supply that. okay, now, let's, uh let's get you onto this bed. ah, yeah. yeah, thanks. mom, grab around my neck there. all right. let me try it another way. uh uh okay. okay. oh, yeah. thank you, that's better. it's the least we could do, mom. oh, hi. oh, honey. i'm sorry we're late. we stopped for a bite to eat. good going, elyse. we're almost there. oh, thank god. well, you're doing fine, elyse. thank you, steven. i'm so glad you're here. oh, me too. wouldn't seem right having the baby without you. oh, it wouldn't have felt right to me if you weren't here. oh. oh. here it comes. push. here it
