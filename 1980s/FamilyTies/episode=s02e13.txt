" oh, did i win. i won. oh. what time is it, steven. elyse, i'm sure your mother's fine. my mother.. you think i'm staying up because of my mother. i happen to love this game. that's why i'm staying up. so just shut up and play poker. want to talk about her. no. i do not want to talk about her. all right. i cannot believe she is out on a date. phillip looked like a perfect gentleman. oh, steven, you are so naive. i have read articles about sex and older people. they retire to these little communities of condominiums. they they take folk dancing. they eat the earlybird special. then they all go home to their hot tubs. there are a lot of grandmas and grandpas in hot water right now. elyse, your mother is a grown woman. i'm sure she can take care of herself. she may be a grown woman, steven, but she cannot take care of herself. my father's always protected her. she's been married for 40 years. what could she know about sex. you know what i mean. yeah. iii am sure she is fine. it's after midnight. why hasn't she come home. i think we should go to bed. i can't. i'm too keyed up to sleep. well, maybe, just maybe, we could think of something else to, uh pass the time up there. hmm. what, you mean now.. with my mother out.. we'll tell her about it. i'm i'm sorry, steven. this whole business with my mother is really getting to me. now, look, elyse, she is practically a divorced woman. you have got to accept it. i could accept it a lot easier if i didn't have to watch mom go gallivanting off with the man who told her to rinse and spit for 20 years. i'll get it. hello. oh, hi. uh, aall right. fine. uh, oh, i will. yyou too. yeah. bye. who was that. uh, that was your mother. uh, she said they had a wonderful time at the concert, uh, they stopped for ice cream afterwards, and, uh oh, uh, yeah, she's, uh, spending the night at phillip's. that's her. she's home. ow. just where have you been.. i was next door at the obecks'. you see, that's how the route goes obecks, keatons, handelmans. fine, fine. you're doing a good job. keep up the good work. as long as i have you here, mrs. keaton, could i interest you in our new line of yogurt products. have a nice day. who was who was at the door. the milkman. how is he. who cares. there she is. she kissed him right in front of us. they weren't in front of us until you opened the door. elyse, why did you open the door just then. ii heard the key. i thought you were the milkman. you gave the milkman the key. mom just where have you been. what. i said, "where have you been." that's what i thought you said. and the answer is, "what business is it of yours." well, we've got a big day ahead of us. gotta get our sleep. it's only 6:15. you're only gonna have well, that sounds like more than enough. are you coming up. no, mom and i have some things to talk about. i'll be up. all right, but all i'll wait is half an hour, then i've got to get to sleep. i don't get my 15 minutes a day, i'm worthless. now, do you mind telling me what this is all about. i've had a very busy evening, and i'd like to get some rest. well, if you would come home at a decent hour, you wouldn't be so tired now. if i'd come home at a decent hour, i would have had to spend the evening arguing with you about the divorce. oh, so rather than talk with your only daughter, you'd rather soak in some man's hot tub.. we did not soak in any hot tub. i'm sorry. i shouldn't have said that. the hot tub was too crowded. we went in the sauna. maybe we'll use the hot tub next time. just what did you and this toothjockey do tonight. i am not going to subject myself to these questions. i'm a mature adult capable of taking care of my own life, and i'm going to do so whether you like it or not. come to think of it, i remember you saying the exact same thing to me about 20 years ago. wait just tell me, after all these years, how can you just go out on dates and be with men. well, to tell you the truth, it isn't easy but it's all coming back to me. good morning. look, steven, we have a very serious problem on our hands here with my mother. i'm trying to figure a few things out. if you don't mind, i'd rather not be diverted by your idle chatter. sorry i rambled on like that. it's okay. did you and your mother talk. you you always take her side, don't you. what. well, admit it, yyou've always liked my mother, haven't you. all right, i confess. i do. sorry, alex, it's just not going to work. aw, come on, jennifer. how do you know until you try. some things you just know. what's the problem. alex wants me to sell his class of '84 moustache wax to the 5th grade. come on, jennifer, jennifer. jennifer, look. i told you, i'm willing to give you half the profits. hey, wait a minute. i thought i was getting half the profits. um the dream is dead, pop. sales haven't been good. sales haven't been. nothing. well, yeah, i sold a bottle of class of '84 suntan lotion to mallory's friend carla. it was, uh $1. 30 total profit. here's your 65 cents. this was once $100, alex. alex, carla wants her money back from that suntan lotion you sold her. it turned her skin green. no way, mallory. she knew the risks. i told her there was a possibility of that happening. dad. well, just how green did she turn. dad. good morning, mom. morning, elyse. kate. morning, grandma. sleep well. not really, jennifer. not at all. what. nothing. don't do that, elyse. you're being very childish. oh, i'm being childish. that's funny. ha ha ha. so, grandma, how was your date. oh, very nice, thank you. how'd the necklace go over. did phillip like it. yes, thank you, he did. oh, i must have left the necklace at his house. i'm sorry. i tend to get a little butterfingered while i'm morally outraged. excuse me. oh, kate. don't goodbye, steven. kate, what are you doing. i'm not going to stay here and be insulted by that woman you married. oh, come on. come on. kate, pl sit sit down. please. please. sit. sit down. look. uh, i know elyse has been, uh a little irrational lately. a little irrational. all right, in some states she'd be put away, but you've got to understand, divorce is always tough on the children. uh so, here we are mother, daughter husband, soninlaw just the four of us. well, maybe, uh maybe i'll be off to work now. iiif it's okay with the two of you go. go. elyse, i'm furious with you. you're mad at me. i'm not the one who stayed out all night. why are you having a harder time accepting this divorce than i am. it's not right. it's unnatural. there are some things in this world that you can count on. the sun comes up in the morning, it's hard to whistle with crackers in your mouth, and my mom and dad do not get divorced. elyse, you're going to have to get used to it. you had a great marriage. we had a great family. everybody said so. was it all a lie. look, we did have a good marriage. we grew apart. it happens. but it doesn't erase the wonderful years we had together. i want my family back. oh, honey. it's so scary. if if you and dad can break up, that can happen to anybody. it could happen to me. no, i don't think it'll ever happen to you. charlie and i were husband and wife for 40 years, but somehow we never became real friends. you and steven are friends. don't you miss dad a little. of course i do. there are a lot of things about your father that i miss. like what. oh, little things. like the way he used to wake me up in the morning. how. he used to lean over and yell, "swimmers, take your marks." and then he'd shoot off a little toy cap pistol. you miss that. i never overslept. you know, elyse i've always belonged to someone else. charlie donnelly's wife. elyse's mother. ned's mother. never just me, kate. this is a very difficult time for me. i guess i haven't made it any easier for you, have i. i really need your support, honey. i need to feel you're behind me. oh, i am, mom. i'm sorry. will you stay. of course i'll stay. you're gonna continue dating, though, huh. yep. okay. no slowdancing on the first date. no coming in after 10:00 on school nights. "school nights. " two feet on the ground at all times. if you're out with someone who's drunk too much, you call me. )
