" but i lost my nerve. it came out, "skippy, you're a doctor. " i had to let him take my temperature. and now he wants to meet that other woman. why is it so important to him. what kind of a son wants to meet his mother. harry: so, what should we do. i mean, are we crazy to be so upset. should we let him meet her. should we tell him where she lives. it's difficult to know what to do in these it's a very personal we're asking you for help. i mean, if you two had some personal problems, what two people would you call upon. us, right. huh. so, what should we do. uh, maybe we should tell him where she lives. i think it would mean a lot to skippy if you, uh, helped him find her. elyse: well, look, rose. if if skippy doesn't meet his natural mother now, he's always gonna wonder about her. and i think it might be good for him if he thought that you weren't afraid for him to meet her. but we are. we're supposed to be washing dishes, mallory. what are you doing. i was just thinking. no, seriously. alex. all right, all right. what are you thinking about. i was thinking about skippy. i know what you mean. i've been thinking about him, too. he's really upset about this adoption thing, isn't he. i think it's the way he found out, you know. he's innocently going through his mother's drawers, looking for money and he finds adoption papers. you know, when i was little, i used to think i was from another planet. don't give up that thought, mal. and one day, my space mom would come down and find me and take me back there with her. why don't you go up on the roof and wait for her. i just got off the phone with mrs. handelman. she's still really upset. do you, uh do you think they're gonna tell skippy where his mom is. i don't know. that's a hard thing to do. mom, you're a mother. how could a mother just give away her own baby. i can't answer that. ii don't know what the circumstances were. you just know that has to have been a very difficult thing to do. i guess she just did what she thought was best. when i have a baby, i'm gonna keep it. even if it turns out to be an alex. i kept him. well, it wasn't easy, jennifer, but you are all packed. great. just think tomorrow at this time, i'll be a fullfledged camper. now, here are a few postcards. they're all stamped and dated. all you have to do is send one to us every day. i can't write you a postcard every day. well, ii know that. that's why i prewrote a few for you. "dear mom and dad, camp is fun, but i miss you terribly.

we just want you to know that we love you with all our hearts. i hope you find what you're looking for in dayton. i hope you find dayton. it gets a little tricky around the wilson interchange. thank

alex. alex keaton. hi. alex. alex keaton. oh. nice to meet you, alex. alex keaton. alex drove me here today because ii don't drive yet. my birthday's not until march. oh, that's right. i forgot she was there. please, come inside. uh. skip, if you don't mind, i'm gonna wait out here, okay. alex, i need skippy you'll be fine. i'll be right here. it really is you after all these years. do i look the same. well, you're bigger and you've got more hair, but otherwise, yeah, you look the same. uh ii don't recognize you. oh. well, that's understandable. last time we saw each other, you were only a few weeks old. so, tell me all about it. all the things we did together. there's not much to tell. basically, you ate and slept and went through a lot of diapers. those were good times, weren't they. well not completely good. no, i wouldn't say they were good times. what do you mean. that was a difficult period of my life. i was 18 and unmarried and ostracized by everybody i knew. what about my father. i bet he was a great guy, huh. well, he was young, too. did, uh, did he know about me. oh, he knew. he he wasn't interested. i see. hey, people are like that. i understand. so, uh what was his name. was he tall. did he ever play a professional sport. ii really don't want to talk about him. i want to know. he was my father. he may be your father, but he was nothing to me. nothing. it was a mistake. then i was a mistake, too, huh. well, hey, that's all in the past now. we could start fresh. you want to hear about, uh, my hobbies or my ambitions. would you like to see my vaccination. oh. i don't think so. okay, uh well, then, let's talk about you, mom. what do you do. i'm a secretary. see. that's amazing. typing's my best subject. oh. ask me anything. or, uh, better yet, why don't you bring out your typewriter. i don't have a typewriter here. that's okay. uh next time i come, i'll bring mine. oh, mom, this is gonna be great. i can come by once a week, and and we can talk and type and irwin i think it's best that you don't come to visit me again. why not. irwin, you have parents. i'm sure you're very important to them. i have mmy own life, too. i can't become a mother, just like that. it's not that easy. it would be very disruptive for both of us. you understand what i'm saying. yeah, i understand. you don't want me. do you have any idea how painful it is seeing you again. it took me 15 years to get my life together again, and you just want to rip it apart again. what do you want from me. i want to know how you could do it. how could you. how could you just give me away. it was the hardest thing i ever had to do. but you still did it. i wanted you to have a good life. i couldn't give it to you. i wanted you to have a real family, nice house, and a dog. you have a dog, erwin. no. but i have a sister. even better. i'd rather have a dog. well i'll be getting out of your way now. irwin you may find this hard to believe, but i gave you away because i loved you. you were my baby boy. you remembered my name. so, skippy, uh you want something to drink. uh, pretzels. no. no, alex. thanks. i'm too depressed to eat. hey, uh, why don't we toss a softball around, huh. how does that sound. dangerous. in the state i'm in, i'd probably miss the ball, and it would hit me in the face. usually happens anyway, skip. alex, i'm in a daze. i'm stunned. my mother rejected me again. my mother never would've acted that way. that's just the point, skip. see, she wouldn't have done that because she is your mother. she loves you. wait a minute. which mother are you talking about. i'm talking about your mother nnot not the one from today, but your other mother your real mother. the one from today is my real mother. well, that's true, but i was referring to the mother that you thought was your real mother until a few days ago. you mean my mother. that's what i said, skip, your mother. when you said my mother, i thought you meant my mother, as in, the one who was my mother first. no, no. i'm talking about your other mother, not the mother who who knew you first. the mother that you knew first. got it. what about her. look, skip. all all i'm trying to say to you is this. yyour mother didn't reject you. the woman who gave birth to you rejected you. you mean my mother. let's not start this again, skip. look when you were 7 years old, and you got your head caught in the banister, who got you loose. my mom. which mom. the one that raised me mrs. handelman. that's right. and when you were 13 years old, and you got your head caught in the banister who got you loose. that time it was my dad mr. handelman. skip if it wasn't for those two people your head would be stuck in that banister right now. that's true. see the woman you met today is your natural mother. and and there's a guy out there who is your natural father. but they haven't been a part of your life for 16 years. they they've had no role in in nurturing you, in molding you, in in caring for you. they, uh they created a baby but they had no part in creating the human being that's irwin n. handelman. oh, even so, alex how would you feel if you found out that your mom and dad aren't your natural parents. it would explain a lot of inconsistencies in my family. look, what it gets right down to, skip, is the people who are most important in your life are the people who love you and the people who care about you. and you got those people, just as much as i do. you're home. yeah. just got back. uh, we would've been here sooner, but we got stuck at the wilson interchange. i was worried you might. they ought to put better signs up there. oh, how'd it go baby boy. uh you don't have to call me that anymore. did you meet her. yeah. i met her. she was pretty nice. i see. alex met her, too. yeah. yeah, she was, um, she was nice. well i'm glad your real mother's nice. you're my real mother. oh, mom. hey. what about me. you're my real dad, dad. let's go home and have real dinner. let's go home. i just said that. )
