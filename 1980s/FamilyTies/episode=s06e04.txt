it's a special show about coin collecting. well, maybe he forgot it was on. what am i saying. he has to see it. we're going to the coin fair on saturday. why don't you go in and start watching, and when alex gets here, he'll join you. no, no, no. that's not how it works. we always watch it from the beginning. we like to sing the theme song. um, well, here, i'lli'll watch it with you. hey. hi, honey. hi, lauren. hi. alex, you're late for wall street week. andy's in there waiting for you. oh, yeah. couldn't be helped, mom. couldn't be helped. it's a big psychology lecture. i didn't want to miss it. you know me. oh. what was it about. a favorite professor of mine was lecturing on the cognitive powers of african baboons. oh, it sounds interesting. why was alex there. because i'm a very supportive boyfriend, mom. lauren's interests are my interests. she wanted me to be there, so i went. means a lot to her. i'm impressed. oh, i'm kidding. i'm kidding. i'm kidding. alex, hurry. wall street week is starting. ooh, listen, uh, i'm going to skip it today, okay, pal. but i already made the popcorn, and the cash register's all heated up. yeah, well, uh, you know, lauren's here, so but we always watch it together. well, i know we do, but, uh, lauren's not always here. yes, she is. so, lauren, howhow's your psychology study coming. oh, i think it's going very oh, very, very well. very well. uh, she's doing a fantastic job. have you decided to have alex committed yet. want to go in the other room and play, alex. no, notnot not right now, andy. but we always play before dinner. i know, i know, andy, but we don't always have company. you know, lauren, i was reading a little jung yesterday, and i was really fascinated by his use of dreams in psychoanalysis. can you analyze dreams. can she analyze dreams. she she's like carnac. go ahead, go ahead, go ahead, show 'em. analyze something. you know, um i had a dream last night. i i, uh ii did, i did. i, uh i i was walking down the street, and suddenly, i noticed, um, i didn't have any clothes on. that's gross, dad. sso, i just, uh i just ran around, hiding behind cars, trying to find my clothes. was i in this dream. um, well, yes you were. you were playing racquetball with dwight eisenhower. but, but, oh let'slet's stick to my part. uh what do you make of this, lauren. is there any hope for my dad. well, dream analysis is very complex. um but if i had to take an educated guess, i would say that this dream shows that your dad's trying to hide something. and there's a part of him he doesn't want anyone to see, which is probably why he has that beard. or maybe not. no, no, no i'm just a student. no, no, that's fine. you know, i can be completely wrong. in fact, i know i am. no, you're no, you're right. obviously. how about this, lauren. is she my little miss freud or what. and she can take a perfectly innocentlooking dream about a man running around naked while his wife plays racquetball with a former president, and use it to prove that that same man has deepseated abnormalities. abnormali. what's abnormal. all i did was look for my clothes. elyse: uh, steven, uh, steven, cancan we talk about this in private. of course. of cour why. are you worried. well, i it's i'm fine. no. ii i just want you to tell me what / was wearing. a lovely sunflowered tennis dress. uh, ruffles. very pretty. andand president eisenhower. the same dress. and were you furious. time to play yet. uh, uh, no, no, not yet, andy. i had a dream. it was really weird. i i was in the mall, and, uh, and i went into my favorite store, and i bought this i bought this really beautiful red leather jacket that i've wanted for the last two months. what do you think that could mean. i think it means you really wanted to buy the jacket. wow. i uh, hello. um, hello, mr. bowman. hi. i'm nick moore, and i really want to sell you ah. thought i had him there for a minute. boy, i thought so, too. ii bet he's
