" also, samantha called to quote: "formalize what she should bring you for lunch tomorrow. " and sheena called just to say, "hey. " what, what, only three messages. michael, i think it's very unfair of you to lead these girls on. lead them on. mom, look fact: the enrollment at dewey high is 3to1 female. fact: the dance of the year is coming up. and fact: even boner has women calling him. good lord. out of my way, armpit. there, there, see, see, did i do anything to provoke that vicious attack. that wasn't very nice. what did mike do. nothing. nothing is right. he's just slime, like every other male that's ever walked the face of the earth. maybe you'd better handle this one. carol, you don't mean all men. yes, i do. but that's very insulting to your father. i don't think of dad as a man. is it the shirt. you know what i mean. i'm talking about hot, goodlooking guys. i sense a trend here. oh, i get it. bobby invited somebody else to this winter fling thing, huh. typical of men who use women and then discard them like so much garbage. you know, that really hurts, carol. it hurts that you see me as a guy who treats girls very crummily. now, if you'll excuse me, i have to return some calls and brighten the day of some very lucky young ladies. so do you want to explain men to carol or women to mike. i'd like someone to explain women to me. just kidding, just one of those charming, whimsical little remarks. oh, mike. oh, carol, i'm so sorry that bobby asked someone else to thei don't know that he asked someone else. i don't know what his plans are. well, honey, you know that bobby's always been a little shy. oh, yeah. he wasn't so shy the other night when. never mind. what other night. that's not the point. the point is, the dance is only a week and a half away and he hasn't asked me yet. maybe you should ask him. the only kind of women who ask men to dances are the kind who don't shave their legs. carol, there is absolutely nothing wrong with a woman asking a man out on a date and it is extremely easy to do. oh, sure. it's true. watch. oh, jason. jason: yeah. would you like to go to the movies on friday night. jason: sure. see. jason: what do you wanna see. oh, nothing. we're not really going. we already have plans on friday. oh. where was i. um, you were telling me that i was wrong to think that women don't make sense.  i'm just saying it's a major mistake to follow your mother's advice. yeah, if i followed my mother's advice, i'd be a quaker. bye. hi, bobby. carol. listen, we've been going out for, what now, two months. yeah. right. and in that time, we've gotten to be good friends. yeah. uhhuh. so we're comfortable around each other and we don't have to put up any act. yeah. great. so if i were gonna ask you to take me to the winter formal, you'd say. no. great. oh. i can't. well, that's great. i'm glad we got that cleared up.  oh, gee, look at the time, um. i gotta go, bye. bobby: carol. l. that's my football. "for that zesty combination of herbs and spices always remember to shake vigorously before opening. " okay. what are you doing. i'm, uh, cooking. what does it look like. oh, yeah. hi, mike. hey, mom. you know, dad, this winter formal thing is gonna be the death of me. all right, if you had to choose between a blond, a redhead and a brunette beauty who would you pick. well, mike, there's much more to a woman than the color of her hair. there's also the size of her intellect. hi, carol, how was your day. everything's fine now. i don't know what's been the matter with me. i mean, new clothes, makeup, contact lenses. thinking someone would wanna take me to a dance. please, i mean, it's just not me. i mean, what am i trying to change. i was just fine working hard and studying. i was just fine without trying to be silly and popular. i mean, who needs all these risks. well, not me. i guess that means she didn't have a good day.  mom, i want to donate all my makeup to the poor. oh, carol, what happened. nothing. nothing important. i just asked bobby to the prom and he turned me down. oh, honey. oh, pumpkin, that's a shame. it's a decision i gotta make. i don't need to see this. i'm way ahead of you. oh, honey, what did bobby say. "no. " how many times do i have to repeat it. well, honey, maybe you just asked him too late. honey, there has to be some reason. yeah, me. i mean, he just doesn't want to take me. well, then he's out of his mind. and that's a professional opinion. yes, you're right. i mean, after all, i've learned from my pain. i mean, who needs a social life when you have an iq of 144, right. i want five minutes with that football player without his protective equipment. don't you get irrational too. but, jason, it would be a nice gesture for you to get a little irrational. okay, if you want to vent, go ahead and vent. vent, one of us has to remain calm. one of us has to do thinking and observing andwhat are you babbling about. well, i'm gonna call that little slime bag sucker right now. carol, we wanna leave in about five minutes. are you ready. no, i am not. i do not want to go to some stupid place to take my mind off the fact that there's some stupid dance tonight that i don't even care about. six minutes will be fine. if you're looking for enthusiasm, it might help to tell where we're going. well, i don't think we can expect much enthusiasm out of carol tonight. i was talking about me. ben, why are you eating. i told you we were going out to dinner. no, we aren't. where we're going, they don't have dinner. shh. you tell our 10yearold son where we're going, but you won't tell me. don't take it personally, mom. no woman can keep a secret. ha. where would he get such a ridiculous idea. not from you, dad. oh, wow, mike, you look fabulous. what, this old thing.  let me get my camera. hey, so who's the lucky date. well, it was a tough decision, dad. and i've given it a lot of thought, and i mean a lot. who's kidding who, dad. i've lost sleep over this. and there was only one decision that seemed to make any sense.  excuse me. all: hello, mike. hello. how do you do. hey. mom, dad, this is the stunning samantha, lovely andrea and the legendary sheena berkowitz. well, you look lovely. the whole crowd of you. cheese. we'll see you guys a little bit later. oh, and, uh, there's no need to wait up. so who wants to drive. andrea: me. i get to sit in the back with mike. who says. well. say something. that's my boy. oh, look at carol. doesn't she look beautiful. oh, honey, you are perfectly dressed for a wonderful evening of. something or other. i hate this whole entire gross disgusting idea. you're going to have fun than you've had since you were 6 years old. come on. i'm gonna puke. wow, it is gonna be a fun night. oh, please, god, make it stop. it's okay, ben, get up. my, my, here it is, the empire state building. spectacular. oh, souvenirs. what a view. can we go now. jason, it is very late. pish tosh. the night is young. pish tosh. when are we getting to the surprise destination. this is it. you're kidding. no, he isn't. surprise. don't you remember when you were 6 years old we came here and you looked through that very telescope and you said, "daddy, there must be magic up here. even new jersey looks pretty.
