no, mike, that's in october, which is when you're gonna be grounded till unless you give me a good explanation. okayno, wait, let me get comfortable here. you know how i love these stories. so, what'll it be tonight, mike. you wereoh, you saved some lives i bet, huh. wait, wait. i bet you ran into those darn gypsies again. hmm.  are you okay. dad. can i talk to you as a friend and not as a guy who could make my life miserable. what's wrong, mike. dad, i gotta know that what i tell you won't be used against me. okay, what is it. so i have your word that whatever i say, you're notmike, just say it, okay. okay. me and eddie and boner we ended up at a party where everybody was doing cocaine. cocaine. mikeremember, you're not my dad, you're a friend. cocaine. really. yeah, and if you didn't do it, you were a wimp. cocaine. dad, i've never felt so much pressure in my life. and. even from boner and eddie. and. dad, it was like i didn't have a choice. and. i didn't do it. you didn't do it, as in you did not. i didn't do the stupid drug. well, that's great, mike, that's. that's wonderful. i always figured you'd make that right choice if you had to face that, but i'm relieved, mike. dad, dad, that's not it. what. dad, i've been thinking about this since the party. i have been driving and drivingmike, mike you did the right thing. yeah, that's what kills me. i don't understand. dad, i know i did the right thing. it's just that i feel like. like everybody's gonna laugh at me. and some of those people did laugh. mike, you're never gonna be able to please everybody. yeah, well, tonight i didn't please anybody. except yourself. yeah. yeah. hey, what you did tonight took real courage, mike. i admire you. thanks. you sleep on it. good night, dad. good night, mike. thanks, dad. um. eddie and boner called for you. what. they said they didn't go to the bathroom and they don't want to. well, what do you know. what does that mean. a lot. what a world.   hi. you know, a lot of people will tell you drugs are cool. the same people who are saying that everybody's doing something. so, what's your problem. well, they're wrong. everybody's not doing drugs, and you don't have to try them to be cool. look, i'm not trying to tell you how to live your lives. but i am telling you that you don't have to do something you don't want to just to keep your friends happy. i mean, if that's the way that they feel, then maybe they're not your friends. and maybe they're not as cool as you thought they were. and one last thing. i'm not being paid to say this. this is how i feel. and if you think that makes me uncool then you're wrong. ) )
