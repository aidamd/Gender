mysterious disease after calling ryan o'neal a series of insulting names.  uh. going somewhere. i was sleepwalking. oh. can you beat that. look at this, mom. i'm fully dressed. ha, ha. michael aaron seaver don't you dare compound your escape from your punishment by using deception. i didn't understand a word of that. sit down. michael, what are you thinking. is it really that hard to do as you're told. you had a simple punishment, but can you be trusted. no, every single timehey, hey, hey, what's this. forget that. that's kleenex. you've been watching love story. i have not. it was love story ii. excuse me, but aren't you supposed to be grounded. michael, we are discussing you. oh, it's okay for you to skip out on your punishment but it's not okay for me. michael, if you think i get some great pleasure from punishing you, you're wrong. oh, come on, mom, i've seen that glimmer of excitement in your eye when you catch me doing something wrong. i've heard that happy ring in your voice when you call me by my full name. michael, you don't understand what a parent goes through. and you sure don't understand me. no, i don't. not when you act like this. and because you're confused i have to miss out on the biggest party of the year. i thought you said last weekend's party was the biggest party of the year. what, do you keep transcripts of our conversations now. michael, when you're 16, every party is the biggest party of the year. that's easy for you to say. what do you know about being 16 and having a parent who's always right. a lot. have you met my father. pleasant man. pleasant man. you know, once he grounded me for no reason at all. no. and all i did was say "damn" at the dinner table. you. and even though he was known to say that and a lot worse, he still grounded me. well, of course, he was an adult. i mean, you wanna talk about unfair. i believe i have been. grounded. forget the fact that it was vicki timar's sweet 16 party. it was a pizza party. i mean, she was my best friend. what was i supposed to do. i climbed out the window and went to that party anyway. wow. and it was a truly great party. ha, ha. because you got away with it. yeah, and i. i understand. and i'm beginning to. come on. where. out. i'm in the mood for pizza. but, mom, we're grounded, remember. shh. i won't tell me what i did if you don't. this is deeply weird. so when does the show start. mm. carol, a superstar like frank sinatra never performs while they're still serving food. does it make him hungry, or what. jason: oh. shh. it's show time. ha, ha.  man : ladies and gentlemen the jackpot room of the fallbrook hotel in atlantic city is proud to present the unique, oneofakind song stylings of a living legend, mr. frank sinatra, jr.  junior.  i suppose this means no joey bishop either. mike: shh. maggie: hahaha.  thanks for the pizza, mike. it hasn't tasted this good since i was 16.  thanks for making getting grounded fun. michael, that wasn't the point of any of this. do i detect the sound of a mother in your voice.  michael aaron seaver. yes, i do. shh. hahaha. i knew this was too good to last. you're gonna tell yourself on me, aren't you. nope. hey, you do understand me. yeah, i guess i do. i don't think i like this. me either. hahaha. hey, i got it. what do you say we just cancel the grounding for the weekend. no, mike. i thought you knew how rotten it was to be grounded. i do, but i also remember that every time it was done to me when i was a kid there were lessons that i never forgot. and i think it helped mold me into a mature, responsible person. come here. come on.  you're busted. will you listen to this. some french actor by the name of, uh, yves montandoh, i love him. yeah, well, he's running for president of france. why would anybody be dumb enough to vote for an actor for president. reagan was an actor. well, yeah, but not a good one.   hey, hi, ed, kate. yeah. tell me, you lucky people, how was atlantic city. really vapid. oh, that's wonderful. how was frank. well, ed, he looks a lot younger in person. ringydingding, huh. the only way we could thank you is by having him autograph the menu. oh, eddie. oh. "ed, i was so sorry that you missed the show. it made my day to find out you were a fan. " oh. "your pal, frank. " oh, wow. pal. you know, when a big guy like this has time for a regular joe like me, it.  it kind of brings back my faith in the world.   ) )
