" who wants to start. okay, then, i will. when i was a little girl i wanted to be a dancer. and do you know why. why. because uncle bob took me to my very first ballet. and i remember he said, "they walk around on their toes "they do flapping things with their arms, and it doesn't make any sense. "but it's pretty, ain't it." remember when i had my appendix taken out and uncle bob brought me one in a jar and told me not to worry 'cause he knew how to put it back in. yeah, and when the nurse came, he showed her the jar and said he got it out of the soda machine. and then he said he wanted his quarter back. and remember what to do when passing slow cars on the road. stroke. stroke. stroke. i remember how much fun it was when uncle bob would make mike lose. what. he could run faster, shoot baskets better. he played games like a champ. i let him win. sure you did. remember the last visit. they're in the homestretch and it's not even close. jason, he lost again. he'll be crushed. i know. he tries so hard, too. here he comes. and the winner is. uncle bob by a mile. uncle bob. uncle bob. bob. uncle bob. please, please. just throw paper money. congratulations. are you through humiliating my son for the evening. i don't know. carol. we can make it if we hurry. let's do it. so the other fellow says: "if i could walk that way, i wouldn't need talcum powder.
