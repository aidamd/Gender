parents, okay. you say stuff like class spirit, you say growth experience but you never ever say women. okay, class spirit. right.  growth experience. yes. all: women. don't leave your books there. take them to your room. no snacking. you'll spoil your dinner. mom and dad are sick and carol is mad with power. is it clean yet. i'm working, i'm working. hey, wait a minute. mom and dad are sick. oh, this is perfect. now i can ask them about the ski trip while they're weak.  uh, carol just told me the awful news and. well, i just thought i'd come in to offer my condolences. we're sick, mike, not dead. well, okay then, that settles it. settles what. there was a class ski trip this weekend and i thought i'd try to get out of it so i could spend some time palling around with you guys. but obviously you're in no shape for that, so i guess i gotta go. jason: forget it, mike. dad. you're not going anywhere while you're still flunking english. oh. oh, great timing, dad. i mean, we had an english test today. couldn't you have told me this before i took it. if i had known you'd take this kind of attitude, i just may have studied for it. oh. i feel worse than mike's grades. ah. me too. i gotta try again to call a doctor. you are a doctor. oh, i guess that's why i keep getting a busy signal.  oh, seaver, wait up, guy. oh, mikey, mikey, mikey. you're not gonna believe this. this has got to be the best news since lucy came back to tv. what. boner. his folks are letting him go on the ski trip. thanks a lot, mikey. how come you ain't sharing in my joy. because i'm not going. what. what. my dad says i have to be passing english, and he tells me this after yesterday's test. are you sure you flunked. eddie, come on, this is me we're talking about. wake up and smell yourself. you know, mikey, as long as there's a grade curve there's always hope. hey, yeah, you know, especially with boner in the curve. i do what i can. why don't you go ask the teacher's aide on this one, huh. hey, thanks a lot, guys. uh, hi. oh, hi, mike. uh, bobbie, right. robin. robin, robin, yeah. so, robin, uh, have you finished grading those tests from yesterday yet. yeah. your definition of a dangling participle was. inspired. dirty. oh, well, how'd i do overall. mike, i can't tell you. oh. why. it's the rules. come on, robin, i gotta know. look, whatever you want. i'll trade you my body for the information. is that an offer. uh. look, robin, i really need to know this grade, okay. now, if i don't pass, i don't go in the ski trip. oh, you're going. well, yeah, if i get a c. so, come on, tell me what i got. what you got rhymes with c. oh, the schools are giving out g's now. dplus. dplus. is that with the curve. that's with an incredible curve.   you would not believe what the rest of this house looks like. i'm gonna kill those kids. we ask them for one favor, "will you help with the house while we're sick." but do they do it. no. jason, the house is perfect. achoo. what. it's like a hospital out there. there is no dust. all the laundry's been done, the table's been set for dinner ben's little clothes have been ironed for tomorrow. i haven't seen the house this organized since i went back to work. oh, good. no, that's very good. you tell a dying man he's a bad housewife. oh. honey, don't get upset. carol just went a little overboard trying to do a great job and i just. i've hurt your feelings, haven't l. no, no, no, justwell, it's really no big deal. if carol does a better job than i do, then we should be grateful. she's a big help, right. right. and just to be clear, we are saying she does do a better job. oh, jasonno, that's what we're saying. no, honey, i reallythat's what i'm hearing. i really didn't mean that. as robin passes out your tests from yesterday i must say i was so shocked no one got below a c. i'm seeking professional help.  an a. i got an a.  robin. an a. i rechecked your paper. uh, yeah, but mrs. trotter is gonna find out. i mean, she'll know. she never even sees the papers. you're safe with me. oh. you look kind of cute with your mouth hanging open like that. oh, yes. this means i can go on the ski trip. look, robin, i really owe you in a major way. well, you're welcome in a major way. look, if there's anything that i can do for you, robin, you got it, okay. mike. the ski trip. yeah, yeah. what about it. i'd love to be your date on the ski trip. what ski trip. the ski trip.  now, robin, robin, see, the thing is none of us are taking dates on the ski trip because there's gonna be so many coyotes up there. yeah, those hills are just crawling with coyotes:  mike, the only reason that you're able to go is because i changed your grade. yeah, and i'm very thankful for that. are you. oh. you know, you're even cuter with that dumb look on your face. so a girl is forcing you to spend the weekend with her. yes. and this is a bad thing. yes. okay, mikey, look at it this way. let's say you was a teacher's aide and you were helping out a cute chick with a phony grade. what would you expect in return. right there, right there. you see. no, no, totally different situation, eddie. how. if i'd treat a girl the way she's been treating me i mean, it would be obvious that. well, that the girl would feel as rotten as i do. you're right, man. it's no different. oh, no, i'm maturing. no. mikey, don't get carried away. yeah, all right. now, the facts here are, if you don't take robin with you on the ski trip she's gonna change your grade back and you can't go. oh. now what do i do. i wish i had problems like this. i've never had a second date with a chick in my life. girls never like me once they get to know me. if no girls knew me, i'd probably be the most popular dude in school. hey, carol, i need to ask you something. take your shoes off. why. i just waxed the floor. okay, carol, look, i need some advice, okay. from moi. okay, nownice job. let's say you were really desperate and you trapped this guy into going out with you. let's not. no, no, no. let's say you trapped him because you like him. now, what could he do to make you not like him. you're serious. yeah. okay, well, first, any guy who'd be trapped into a date is a weakkneed weenie man. i am talking major wimp here. forget it, forget it. ben: okay, i cleaned my room and very nice job. the place doesn't look so great. hey, dad. look, dust. she calls this clean. ha. dad, i think it's the fever talking. oh, yeah, it's me. everything else is just fine. wait, i know something that's not fine. what happened on your english test, huh. huh, huh. all right. i got an a. let me see that test. a. wow. yeah, i didn't even cheat on it. "punctuation. the colon is where food digests after you eat it. " uh, it was graded on a curve. yeah, apparently. well, i guess that means you'll be able to go on that ski trip after all. yeah, i guess so. you don't sound too thrilled about it. dad, can i ask your advice about something. why. well, you're my dad, you like that kind of stuff. oh, yeah. now, if somebody does you a favor out of the blue and it's a really great favor but you didn't ask them to and they want you to pay them back, what do you do. well, for starters, you should refuse the favor. are you kidding. well, then you gotta pay them back. ah. that was not the answer i was hoping for. this have anything to do with that ski trip you're going on. you're going. mike, you passed. passed. he got an a. an a. wow, mike. let me see that test.
