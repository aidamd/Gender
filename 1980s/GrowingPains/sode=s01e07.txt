big deal out of it. mike, here's $100. i was going to do this for nothing, but thanks. that's for emergency use only. so, like, if we have emergency dates. just kidding, dad. i find that humor keeps the little ones at ease. thanks for the tip, mike. now, we want you guys to all try and get along. mike is in charge. and i want to reassure you that if anything should go amiss justice will be swift and severe. dad, don't you think there should be like a system of checks and balances here. i mean, i can accept that mike has a certain authority just so ben and i have baseball bats. i'll get that. good afternoon. i'm from the facts are us encyclopedia company. i'm sorry, sir. but my parents really don't have time at the moment. you see, they're about to go away for the weekend. okay, thank you

on, i dare you. double dare. you're on. still crazy after all these years. look out. you know, maybe we should call the kids. did somebody say we should call the kids. i mean, they feel so far away. yeah. you know, 300 miles away. yeah. can you imagine how tiny they'd look from 300 miles away. yeah. how lost, how helpless, how abandoned. maggie, it's after 10:00. we said we'd call them in the morning. i know, but and ben's asleep. you really don't want to wake him up now, do you. sweetheart, why don't you just start unpacking or something. okay. all right. i'll start by putting away your

would not barbecue our house. then what's going on. why won't they answer the phone. why don't we just think about this calmly for a minute, okay. we know they wouldn't do anything crazy. maybe they just decided to do something together. something they could all enjoy.

because we're going home. but, honey, it's a fivehour drive. we can fly down and we'll take a cab, okay. that's where we belong. okay. okay. did you get, you got the goggles, didn't you. please, yes, thanks. okay. all right. i have it, the damn key's bent now. you sure you have the right one. well, what does that look like. the hotel key. mike, what's going on. i'm tired. look, there's somebody in the house. i want you guys to go down the garage roof, climb out on the oak tree and call the police from the coozman's. go on. oh, no, jason. they're really not here. what are we gonna do. we'll check back with the police. okay, come on. yes, yes, please. thank you very much. well, the police were here at 11:00, and all the kids were here then. but, jason, they're gone now. i know. they're gonna send another patrol car over right away. freeze. that was quick. hands up. over by the rail. no, you see move it. all right. but we're the seavers. we live here. the seavers are in vermont, lady. no, we flew back. we're them. we're home. all right, let's see some id, pal. it's not a good picture. all right, why don't you go outside and get those kids and bring them in here. where are they. are they safe. you've found the kids. well, they were fine until they heard some prowlers downstairs and called the cops. they can't be my parents. my parents are in vermont. i don't believe this. my babies. not so fast. mike, are these your parents. either that, or somebody's very clever with makeup. where were you. we worried about you. hey, thanks for keeping things fun. what are you guys doing here. i mean, wasn't it enough to send the cops by once this evening. but, mike, we called and you weren't here. you said you weren't going to call till tomorrow. that's not the point, mike. where the hell were you. mrs. moisiodis made a bundt cake. she invited us over for dessert. and then she pulled out the vacation slides. they went everywhere. but we called at 10:00, mike. where were you then. norway. something to bear in mind, mom. if you've seen one fjord, you've seen them all. is that all true, carol. well, actually it was more a strudel than a bundt cake. and the rest of it is about right. what did you guys think we were doing here, anyway. remember how we always swore we'd never do certain things to our kids that our parents did to us. did we just do one of those things to our kids. i don't know. i think we handled it pretty well under the circumstances. it could have been a lot worse. how. it could have been us watching mrs. moisiodis' vacation slides. jason. i guess we turned out to be pretty normal parents after all. oh, no, maggie. are we normal. pretty scary, isn't it. it is. say, do you think two normal parents would go out at 3:00 in the morning for a doubledipped banana fudge sundae surprise. i doubt it. you want to be abnormal. love to. okay, you go tell mike we're going out and i'll warm up the volvo. jason, there's just one problem. what. the volvo's in vermont. english ) )
