"i'm very sorry. " i'm very sorry i gave ben the dirty phone number. i have to interrupt hereno, doc. you said it all on the phone when you said that kris here was exerting negative peer pressure. i didn't knowme neither, until i looked it up. go ahead, mister. and i'll pay for your phone bill out of my allowance till it's all paid off. okay, let's go. wait a minute, bud. there's been a mistake. what do you mean a mistake. all that could save me now was a natural disaster like a flood or a hurricane or a tycoon. please, bud, sit. kris. ah. maybe later. bud, i should not have called you. are you kidding. if it was your kid pulling that malarkey i'd be at your door looking to exert negative peer pressure on somebody's face. aha. you know, doc, under the circumstances, i think you're being a real gentleman. bud, i'd like to appeal to your sense of irony here. okay. you know, when you think about it, it's almost kind of funny.  funny. see, as a psychiatrist i understand that a kid can get confused when he gets in a jam. well, as a plumber, i know that when my kid stops up on me i gotta flush the truth out of him. i couldn't take it anymore. i cracked. i did it, mr. koosman, i did it. i passed out the number. you lied to me. i told you it wasn't me, pop. yeah, but then after i tanned your hide, you said it was. we're just very sorry about the whole thing, really. ah. it's no sweat. the little buckaroo had a spanking coming for something i didn't even know about. but, pop, ilook, look. tell you what i'm gonna do. next time you got a couple of whacks coming, i'll forget about it. ah. now, you see, this is a perfect example of how i, for one have learned not to jump to conclusions about my children. i don't blame you. let's go. ben, don't you have something to say to kris. kris. what. i'm sorry. hey, hey, that's rude. all right, that's your freebie, pal. enjoy it. boy, i don't know what gets into him, you know. sometimes he acts like a little kid. well, ben, i want you to go to your room. i want you to think about why making those phone calls was wrong. why lying about it was even more wrong, and what you're gonna do about it. so i'll be there a long time. go. i don't know how long i was there trying to figure out what you wanted to hear. i must have fell asleep because it suddenly came to me that it was all a bad dream. that i never called nobody, and i was the same little kid you loved. then carol walked in. ben. is it morning. in australia, but not here. listen, i wanted to warn you. dad's coming up here to talk to you. and he's been walking around breathing through his nose. oh, no. since this is your first time with the big punishment scene i thought i'd give you a few tips. you never help mike. seeing him squirm is fun. seeing you suffer is like watching merv griffin sing. thanks. the first thing you have to know is that parents blame themselves for every bad thing we do. really. yeah. so if you get cornered, say something like: "i didn't know any better. " second, say you got the idea from rock music lyrics. you finished, carol. dad, how long have you been here. long enough. carol was right, you were breathing through your nose. good luck, ben. ben, i havedad, i didn't know any better. and i'm through with rock 'n' roll. feel better. no. nuts. ben, this is gonna go a lot faster if you'll just be straight with me, okay. where did you get the number. from a poster on a tree in the park where the big kids hang out. that's the truth. yes. are we done. no, i'll let you know. did you know what you were listening to, you shouldn't be listening to. kind of. that's yes. no. then you didn't know. not exactly. ben, we were on a roll here. well, i knew it was dirty, but it didn't make much sense. well, then why did you pass it out. are you kidding. word spread i had the number and kids were all over me. even big kids. for once i wasn't mike's little brother, i was ben, the goodtime guy. that's a dubious distinction, ben. yeah, it was great. if you're curious about sex, you've gotta come to me or your mom and talk. don't let your fingers do the walking. i hate the phone. i'm never gonna use the phone again. well, we have to talk about sex here. haven't i heard enough about that. well, you haven't heard anything that's right, or healthy or real. sex isn't something that you buy or sell on the street or at a newsstand, or on the phone. yeah. yeah. sex is a beautiful thing, it's a private thing that two people share when they care about each other. it's not between one person and a public utility. you actually told him that. more or less, yeah. "that's when you told me to write all this stuff down. i learned a lot from this. i know that sex isn't something to use to make you famous.  and i know i should never have made those calls and i'll pay for them somehow. the one thing i still don't get is, since i shouldn't hear junk like that how come it's so easy for a little kid like me to get the number." all right, i'm sorry, your little benny has gone too far this time. what's this. he hid all the phone cords. says they only cause heartache. i think it's kind of cute. cute. now he has got to be punished. i think it's time you took a firmerspeaking of punishment, there's still that little matter of you cutting school to go to coney island. on the other hand, what good does punishment really do. what kids need today is love. so why not reach out. reach out and touch someone. you gotta admit it. yep, he is good. ) )
