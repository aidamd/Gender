"it's only 15 minutes". maggie, a lot can happen in 15 minutes. the titanic sunk in 15 minutes. charlton heston picked up ten commandments in 15 minutes. our first child was conceived in 15 minutes. tops. jason, are you jealous. jealous. of what. of me and fred. you know, working late. of you and that is a comical thought. jason, you are jealous. no, i'm not. come on. yes, you are. no, i'm not jealous, maggie. i'm a psychiatrist. i'm also a man with a heightened degree of selfawareness, and for that reason i can admit to a certain sense of loss over the fact that you now share things with a professional colleague until 10:00 or 11:00 at night. things you and i are unable to share. but i hasten to add, i would feel exactly the same way if your colleague were a woman. well, you're probably right. well, there's no "probably" about it, maggie. analyzing people's motivations is what i do for a living. i am not sexually jealous. i have far too much faith in you to ever be sexually jealous. and i would appreciate it if you had the same faith in me. i'm sorry, jason. i was just kidding. forgive me. well, okay. okay. good, i'll see you later. so, what time you think you'll be home. mike, cut it out. what. i wasn't doing anything. mike, will you stop bothering your sister. dad, what's another word for "election." plebiscite. i didn't ask you. i asked dad. what's the difference. the difference is i don't want to know from you. sorry. how do you spell it. why should i tell you how to spell it. because i asked you. i thought you didn't want to know things from me. what are you. a lawyer. i mean, i'm trying to do you a favor here by finding a use for your brain and out of nowhere, you turn on me like a wild dog. cut it out. female subject grabs wrist after third click. you do that again and i'll kill you. male subject threatens death after first click. ben, what are you doing. it's my science project. i'm testing to see how long it takes certain people to respond to certain stimuli. well, that's not a good science project, so stop it. but you told me to do something that interests me. mike and carol interest me more than mold. that's a touching sentiment, ben. now cut it out. what's with him. he doesn't like you. he never has. hey, dad, when's mom coming home. do i look like jeane dixon, mike. your mother's a working adult and when she's finished working she'll come home. i wish she'd get here, 'cause she thinks of great science projects. she does. last year she picked tadpoles. well, that's it, then. i can't do tadpoles, again. they keep these things on file. no, i mean your mother. we should be asking your mother what to do. in fact, i think i'll go down to that newspaper office right now and ask her. dad, why don't you just call her. obviously you haven't seen the phones they have down there. believe me, it's be a lot simpler this way. won't that be bothering her, dad. absolutely not. no, no. your mother wants to be involved in these decisions. besides, i don't like the idea of her being down at the office this late at night, all by herself. she's not all by herself. fred's with her. even so. fred, who's that. i don't know. the janitor. no one who cleans for a living would press his nose against glass. maybe it's one of those goons from the easttown dump site. no, i'll call the police. jason. jason. are you all right. honey. i'm sorry, i didn't know it was you. no, no, i'm fine. come in here and sit down. fortunately, my nose stopped the door before it could hit my face. jason, what are you doing here. what am i doing here. it's about ben. jason, what is it. is it serious. well, of course it's serious. i wouldn't come down here if it wasn't serious, would i. i don't know what to do with the boy, maggie. he's got a bad attitude about mold. and it's just not ethical for him to do tadpoles again. excuse me. this sounds personal. you came down here to check up on me, didn't you. oh, well, that's great. that's just great. i come down to discuss the welfare of our youngest son. our baby, if you will, and you twist it into something sordid. i have a good mind i should just turn around and walk out of here right now. i don't believe this. i mean, you thought you actually thought there was something going on between me and fred. i can't even dignify that with a response. you like him better than me, don't you. jason. come on, maggie, admit it, i'm not a complete idiot. "maggie, do you want some eggs." "no time. " well, "maggie, how about if we meet for lunch. "oh, i completely forgot. " well, "maggie, how was your day today. "i don't want to talk about it. fred called. "oh, i have time to talk to him." jason. don't "jason" me, maggie. i've also been watching the way you're dressing lately. and now i understand it. it's because when he looks at you, he looks at you as if you were as if you were a woman. yeah, you know, at first i couldn't figure that out. and then it dawned on me. i am a woman. so, you admit it. you're into this, maggie. you enjoy it. yeah, i enjoy it. people find me interesting and that makes me feel good. what's wrong with that. what's wrong with it is, you're putting your husband through a living hell. and, maggie, i would never do that to you. what do you mean means i spent 15 years in sweatpants cleaning toilets while you went down to your office in your sexy psychiatrist's sweater and your sexy psychiatrist's jacket my jackets aren't sexy, maggie, they're tweed. women die for tweed and you know it. i have no control over that. and how many nights did i spend watching your broccoli go limp while i waited for you to come home. i was fighting traffic, maggie. yeah, with that brilliant young psychiatrist in your car pool. dr. rosenblum. dr. jennifer rosenblum. who, as i noticed, always managed to ride in the front seat next to you. maggie, she had very long legs. well, that's a relief. i hope legroom wasn't a problem when the two of you jetted off to chicago for that psychiatric convention. we were writing a paper together. yes, i remember it. human sexual inhibitions: use them or lose them. maggie, that was strictly a professional relationship. what do you think this is. was that a rhetorical question. waiting for someone else to come home all the time is hard, jason. but you get better at it. i hope so. suddenly i feel very silly. well, "silly" is a strong word. not entirely inappropriate, but strong. jason, i love you. i could never cheat on you. yeah. yeah. well, thank you. well, you're welcome. caterpillars. what. it's obvious. ben should do caterpillars. now that's a great idea. thanks. it's a good thing i came down here tonight. so, how's ben doing with his caterpillars. somebody else was already doing caterpillars. ben had to think of a new project. a new project. please. pretty good. hey, where's my mold experiment. english ) )
