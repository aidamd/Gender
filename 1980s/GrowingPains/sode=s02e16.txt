let's go, let's go, let's go. we're gonna be late. ben, do you have to yell. sure, i'm excited. well, then, go outside. ben: what the heck's taking so long. we've gotta move. get back inside, ben. i'm sorry, dad, i lost control. yes, and everyone on the block knows it. i can't help it. how many kids get to spend their friday night at a live taping of the cosby show. i know, i'm excited too, ben, but you don't hear me yelling. come on, let's go. what's taking mom and carol so darn long. i guess you're finally old enough to hear this. what. women are always late. why. no one knows, ben. it's just the way it is and always has been. we could leave without them. this is it, the next thing you have to learn about women, ben they hate when you ditch them. why are they always late. i didn't say women made sense. what. i said they make tremendous sense. ha, ha. let's face it, ben, they're just better than us. oh, you look great. does she look great. you looki'm gonna start the car. do we have to wait for carol too. she's your sister. so. all set. how do i look. great. mike, we're leaving. okay, you guys have fun. hey, carol, come on, aren't you gonna get ready. may your date tonight turn out to be the most embarrassing event of your entire life. mike, i don't get it. how could you go and mess around with some stupid girl when you could see the taping of the number one show on tv. when puberty hits, you'll get it, ben. dad already told me about girls. i'm not impressed.  wasn't that a great ending. ha, ha. i missed it. i can't believe i missed it. oh, no. puberty.  mike: all right, i made it.  what the. ben, what are you doing. mike, i had to talk to you and i didn't wanna miss you. you almost killed me. but, mike, something weird happened tonight. what. puberty. get out of here. i'm not kidding. i mean, there i was laughing, having a great time. i look over and there's this girl, and she's looking at me real funny and she goes: and, bang, i heard this weird kind of music and everything looked goofy and i was sweating. i felt, i don't know, kind of like my body didn't quite fit anymore. yep, that's puberty, all right. it was gross. how do i stop it. ah, you can't, ben. see, nobody stops puberty. well, how long does it last. you never know, i mean, it could last forever. look at michael j. fox. well, i'm confused. yeah, you gotta learn to live with it, ben. like you have. right. but i don't wanna make a jerk out of myself every time a girl walks into the room. who says i do that. mom. you're just gonna have to take my word on this one. now, puberty is fantastic. i mean, it's like an amusement park filled with girls. but i hate girls. oh, come on, ben, think about that. do you really hate girls. yes. no. no, i don't hate girls. easy, easy. but, mike, i don't know anything about girls. what do i say to them. ben, listenexplain girls, mike, please, please, please. you're gonna have to talk to dad, okay. i can't do that, mike. this is private, help me. okay, look, ben, i'll be straight with you. dad made me promise that if you ever came to me with any questions on sex i wouldn't say a word. who's talking about sex. i wanna know about girls. hi. maggie: good morning, benny. are you wearing aftershave. yeah. why. i don't know. would you guys mind if i didn't talk. i've got stuff to think about. think away. jason, you know what would be fun. tonight, you and i go out on a date. date. you remember those. we used to have them when we were teenagers. those. yeah, we get all dressed up. go out for a nice dinner, a little dancing. i mean, how long has it been since we've done that. how old is mike. how about it, sailor. oh, i don't know. ben, what do you think. you got any advice. i don't even know what you're supposed to do on a date. well, you go out, have a good time. doing what. well, it doesn't matter exactly what you're doing, ben. what matters is that you're spending time with the one who captured your heart. how do you know she's captured your heart. she pays. jason. kidding. you know i'm kidding, don't you, ben. oh, yeah. well, then, you got a date, honey. oh, great. i'll go call a sitter. i don't need a babysitter. maggie: yes, you do, ben. dad. we've been through this before, ben. oh, great, a whole stupid boring night with a 12yearold girl. hmm.  hey, babe, what's happening. how come you're talking to yourself. i'm not talking to myself, i'm just rehearsing my moves. what are moves. they're what you put on girls. oh, yeah. how come you do that. in order to look cool, ben. see, it's just as important to look cool as it is to be cool. but you're wearing your old pants. well, yeah. although it is important to look cool the worst thing i could do is to make it look like i went out of my way. why. why. ben, look, girls don't like guys who are wimps. they like guys who are a little bit unpredictable. the kind of guy who's a little bit dangerous. kind of guy who can get into trouble at any moment. so pee wee herman probably has more dates than he can handle. get out. get out, ben. let's go, let's go, let's go. dad, i'm gonna let you in on a little secret, okay. girls are always late. really. yeah. so who's the lucky girl tonight. well, i'm going out with sheena "woowoo" berkowitz. see you later, dad.  woowoo. come on, maggie, the reservation is for 7:30. wow, you're gonna be late. see you. wait now, let me get this straight, you are going where. bobby's taking me to a movie, i'm waiting on the porch. when he comes in, he has to talk to you, makes him nervous. so i figured i'd wait for him outside and spare him the pain. well, how thoughtful. wow, like, i didn't even ring yet. hi, trudy. bye. hi, dr. seaver. sorry i'm late. oh, that's okay, trudy. all women are. all women are what. well, hi. i'm jason seaver. i'm your date this evening. and you are. anxious. oh, trudy, the phone number of the restaurant is by the phone. help yourself, we'll be back around 11. right. ben. ben: i'm still in the stupid bathroom. he's taking a shower. that's his third one today. maybe he can make up for last year. ha, ha. we're leaving, ben. ben: okay. see you, trudy. trudy: bye.  hey, babes. what's happening.  ben: what the heck's going on here. i'm using all my moves and she acts like she doesn't care. wait a minute, what did dad say. "women don't make sense. " wow, so i guess it's going the way it's supposed to. so far, so good. ben, stop clowning around, huh. what. get away from me.  what are you doing. i've had enough of this junk. i'm in the mood to do something unpredictable, something dangerous. i don't know, i'm just the kind of kid who likes to get in trouble. you'd better not, young man. this is the best babysitting job i've got, and i'm not about to lose it. now sit still and be quiet or i'll send you to bed. ben: this is the worst night of my life. this is the worst night of my life. i can't believe this, i was stood up. me, mike seaver, stood up. can you believe that. i sure can. yeah, that's it. i have had it with women. should i call my folks to come get me. yeah, sure. go ahead. i'm just gonna hang out here with ben. ben, why are you dressed like that. benny. mike, please, mike, don't, mike, please don't. benny, are you putting the moves on your babysitter.  mike: yeah, boner. look, uh, i've got some news about my date with "woowoo" berkowitz. yeah. you're not gonna believe this but i got stood up. oh, why is that so easy for you to believe.  i just wanted to let you know that as of tonight, i am taking a break from women. well, hi. break's over. hey, babe, what's happening. oh, not much. i'm trudy's sister. i had to drive all the way over here to pick her up. uh, you drive. so you're 16. eighteen. eighteen. eighteen's good. uh, hey, what a coincidence. is that your convertible in the driveway. uh, yeah, it sure is. you want it.  i'm stacy. yeah, i'muh, mike. i'm bored. oh, yeah. well, um, it was nice meeting you. yeah, yeah, same here. say, um, would you like to go out sometime. oh, i'd love to. oh, but i'm only in town for the weekend. i have to go back to georgetown. university. you go to college. yeah. you. uh, another coincidence. um, well, what about tonight. oh, well, it's a little late for a date. if you went out now, dad would have a cow. what do you know, trudy.  mike, uh, the truth is, i'm a little bit tired. yeah, right. can we go. wait in the car. kids. so young, so impatient. ha, ha. uh, well, i'm coming back in three weeks. three weeks. i mean, um, yeah, all right, we could work something out. yeah, you could come down to d. c. d. c. . no, i don't think my folks. i mean, my volkswagen's gonna make it. uh, see, i'm just visiting home for the weekend too. oh, where do you go to school. yale. wow. yeah. see, so it would be a real long drive to d. c. from boston. boston. yale's in new haven, harvard's in boston.  oh, uh, right, i make that same mistake all the time. see, i turned down a yale scholarship and took the one from harvard instead.  oh, my little sister is freaking out.  yeah, you know, my little brother probably drove her to it. see, he just recently discovered girls and, uh, maybe trudy had gotten a little more than she had bargained for. oh, that's sweet.   well. um, you know, it's very sweet. you know what really gets me is that the first crush my little brother has on a girl she has to go home early. oh, that's a shame. a shame. it's a crime. i think it's just as wrong that my little sister is denied the experience of some innocent flirting. um, you know, i couldn't agree more. and with the way the world's going today i think that these two kids may stumble into puberty without adults like you and me around. oh, that's frightening. that's the idea. i'll get my sister. okay.  all aboard. mr. and mrs. jones, here's your train. benny, my man, there you are. leave me alone, mike. look, ben, i need you upstairs. trudy's up there. mike, i'm through with girls. you can't be. you haven't started yet. i'm thinking about the priesthood. all right, so maybe things haven't gone that well for you today. mike, she laughed at me. so, ben, all women laugh at guys. you just gotta get used to it. this is no time to give up. oh, good, mike, you just squished mr. and mrs. jones. i'll tell you what i'm gonna do, okay. i'm gonna tell you about women so you can go back and have the last laugh. she doesn't care. doesn't care. come on, ben, don't fall for her little act. now listen to me, all girls do and say the opposite of what they mean. now, don't tell me you didn't know that. of course i did, i just forgot for a minute. are you gonna go back or you gonna sit and wimp out. i don't know what to say to her, how to act with her. okay, okay, now the single and most important thing is not to embarrass yourself. okay. okay, that means no belching. ever. well, at least not when you're with her. gotcha. okay, no screaming. of course not. okay, and the most important thing, ben, don't have anything with you that's alive. oh. let me go, let me go. he's just a stupid little kid and i don't care about him. you keep your mouth shut. and you pretend to like him, and you do it for me. hi. sure. um, look, why don't you two finish watching a movie and i'll show stacy the kitchen. i'd love to see the kitchen. i understand you love me. not at all. good. very good. i don't like you either. this is what i like to call the refrigerator. uhhuh. wanna touch it.  so, what else can i show you. ben, stop that. yeah, right. so you see, according to my sociology professor at haleuh, yarvard. at college. um, the single greatest barrier between malefemale relations is tension about the first kiss. now, we could just do that right now and get it all over with. well, you know, i just don't. there. i feel so much better. you make me feel like a high school boy again. where did you graduate from. uh, dewey high. you're a hooter. i'm a hooter, class of '86. yeah, what a coincidence. you couldn't have been in my class, i'd remember you. um, well, i was much shorter then. you should have looked down, there i was. your hand is sweating all over my back. yuck. you're welcome. try it again and i'll slug you. wait a minute, are you really saying you really don't like me. ben, you're just a stupid little kid with sweaty hands. that's it, i've had it with girls. i got all dressed up for you and i wasn't supposed to tell you that. you say the opposite of what you mean, but you really mean it. this is too hard. everything was so simple before i went to the cosby show. you've been to a taping of the cosby show, in person. yeah. really. we do stuff like that all the time. wow. mike: ow. come on, trudy, we're getting out of this playpen. i didn't say i went to college, i said it was a coincidence. oh, and what was the coincidence. well, that you're going to college and i've heard of it. oh, grow up. why are you still sitting there. i said let's go. do i have to. ben and i are having a very interesting conversation. we're leaving. i'm sorry, ben, i have to go. you're really sorry. are you kidding. wait a minute. i thought you hated him. that's before i got to know him. when can we get together and talk. um, gee, i don't know. i guess i'll call you. no, no, i'll call you. benjamin, bye. wow, the cosby show. i've also been to the $10,000 pyramid starring mr. dick clark. all right, all right, what's the deal. what deal. i wanna know what you said to trudy. just what you told me to. and what else. that's it. ben, what else did you say. i need to know. mike, are you asking my advice about women. what. oh, come on, ben, that's stupid. so, like, what did you say. but i thought you knew everything about girls. well, of course i do. okay, all right, maybe not everything, but a lot. i know a whole lot. all right, nothing, zero, zip. but i always thoughtwell, of course you did, ben. i mean, you were just a starryeyed little kid. but i guess it's time you learned the truth, now that you're a guy. i'm an actual guy. yeah, a small one, but, yes. gee, i'm a guy and i know as much about girls as you do. you know nothing. uhhuh.  hi, guys. ben & mike: hi. you're up late. yeah, we're having a nightcap. oh, and, uh, since you asked, yes, we had a great date. yeah, we sure did. well, good night. what, the evening's over. night, boys. good night, mom. good night. see you in the morning. uh, dad, dad, you got a second. well, actually iuh, it's important. well, okay, what is it. well, um, see, me and ben were discussing women and we kind of wanted to know your thoughts. you two were discussing women. yeah, i'm a guy now. oh. so, what do you think. see, what we need to know is like at what age did you finally understand women.  what's so funny. well, nothing. it was justseems like only yesterday that i was asking my dad that exact question. when was that. it was yesterday.  hi, mom. carol, you startled me. why are you sitting here in the dark. ah, bobby and i are fighting. oh, i'm sorry. why. he says i should call him if i ever decide to make sense. well, that's pretty rude. yeah, i thought so too. so you're having some cake so you feel better. no, i'm not hungry. you want some cake. no, no, i never eat cake this late. mom, do you understand men. no, but that's okay. they don't understand us either. what's not to understand. you got me. ) )
