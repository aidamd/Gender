look so tiny.  what are you doing.  just talking to my sister.  i know what you're up to.  you're trying to talk michelle into the big screen tv.  so what if i am.  you're working on her day and night.  00 in the morning whispering in her ear, " that wasyou.  big screen.  karaoke.  big screen. karaoke.  big screen. karaoke.  dad. please.  help. help.  what's the matter, honey.  make the voices stop.  , stephanie, move away from your sister.  we're going to settle this once and for all.  i'm taking you to big sid's, and youand you alonewill decide.  dad, that's not fair.  without

can all enjoy.  i'm sorry, girls. it was michelle's decision.  personally, i lobbied for the washerdryer.  this way we could always remember little sid.  big sid's kind of cute, too.  hey.  what's big sid doing here.  he lives here now.  we could prop it up in the window and scare the amway lady.   o.k., that would be joey and roxy.  we want to be really nice to her.  but, dad, she insulted us.  but joey cares about her.  let's give her a second chance.  let's be good sports and show her we like her.  how do we do that.  well, i guess a good way would be to laugh at all of her jokes.  if they're not funny.  laugh anyway.  if we want to keep joey in our lives, we'll have to laugh like we've never laughed before.  hahahahaha.  what was that.  i never laughed like that before.  why are we doing this.  they don't like me.  oh, no. they just don't know you like i do.  give them another chance.  i just don't want to bomb with your family again.  well, then this time don't worry about being funny.  just be open and honest, and everything will work out.  are you sure.  of course i'm sure.  then again, i was sure that the chicken mcliver was going to take off.  all right, my famous
