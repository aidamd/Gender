uncle's attention.  now she wants to be the baby.  what gives you a crazy idea like that.  .. intuition, instinct, and the fact that michelle's sitting in the crib sucking her thumb.  i'm a baby.  oh, michelle.  here.  michelle, you're not a baby.  you're a big girl.  googoogahgah.  we got to do something.  well, the obvious thing to do is reward michelle for acting like a big girl.  you obviously know nothing about child psychology.  oh, really.  yes, really.  you just have to lay down the law.  ..  and learn.  should i take notes, wise one.  wouldn't hurt.  michelle, stop clowning around.  get out of that and show us you're a big girl.  waah.  try the reward method.  please, that never works.  try and i'll give you a back rub.  it's worth a shot.  why, because i'm going to reward you.  just because you tricked me doesn't mean michelle's dumb enough to fall for it.  i've been working on this problem for an hour.  the answer isyou'll never use algebra in real life.  joey, iyou'll never get into college.  you'll end up working in some diner serving chicken fried steaks and creamed corn to truck drivers named tiny and duke and buck.  joey, relax.  i called the homework hotline.  they helped me do it.  see, "x" is the total.  "y" is the price of a pound of walnuts.  " "z" equals "x" minus "y" divided by 2, which makes the price $5.50.  oh, sure. it's easy when you use letters.  i was using real nuts.  give me another problem.  ok.  ok.  ..  neatness counts.  i'll get right on it.  doing my homework. can't talk now.  who wanted to talk to him.  rls, i'm have a little problem.  i want to ask you something.  i've been hanging around tony, and michelle's getting jealous.  tony's a baby, so michelle's acting like one.  i figured i'll give her something to reward her for being a big girl.  any ideas.  michelle has had her eye on mr. bear ever since she could crawl.  so what's your point.  you said one day you'd give mr. bear to michelle.  when i said one day, i meant like her wedding day.  why don't you give her your pillow person.  ..mr. bear is a child's toy.  my pillow person is a sophisticated companion.  please. sophisticated.  it's got arms and legs growing out of its face.  i say we let michelle decide.  fine with me.  it is a stupid looking pillow.  michelle, pick a toy.  haven't you always wanted this darling little bear.  i'm sure you'd rather have this sophisticated companion.  you don't want this boring, square person.  but he's much better than this disgusting, yucky old bear.  i'll explain later.  michelle, to get one of these toys you have to act like a big girl.  these are biggirl toys. capisce.  capisce.  eenie, meenie, minie, moe.  catch a tiger by the toe.  if he hollers, let him go.  eenie, meenie, minie, moe.  i pick mr. bear.  oh, thank you, thank you, thank you.  oh.  goodbye, old friend.  hello, new friend.  i'm proud of you.  if it makes michelle happy, i guess it was worth it.  what have i done.  well, i guess i took care of that.  turn around.  michelle, get out of the crib.  she's back in the crib.  if she's still acting like a baby, the deal is off.  i want mr. bear back.  no.   oh. well, i'll go get tony a bottle.  take care of this, will you, beckala.  give me mr. bear.  his name is willie.  you changed his name.  you got it, dude.  now beholdthe new and improved comet.  comet, lie down.  he will lie down eventually.  when he does, i'll be waiting with a doggie yummy.  i'm glad you're here.  there's a problem with michelle.  i've been hanging out with tony, and michelle's freaking out.  she's acting like a baby.  poor kid. how'd you handle it.  i told her to start acting like an adult.  when that didn't work, what did you do.  tried giving a reward for being a big girl.  you tried to bribe her.  don't cheapen it.  what should i do.  if you want michelle to act like a big girl, talk to her like she's one in words she'll understand.  you got it, dude.  it's time for a special uncle to niece talk, ok.  i'm not giving willie back.  all right, michelle.  tell your uncle jesse why you're having a bummer of a day.  you like tony better than me.  oh, michelle, that's not true.  you're my best pal.  we go back three years.  you gave tony my room and my song.  i was just trying to be nice to our friend.  i should have asked you first, because i'd never want to hurt your feelings, pal.  you want to know why.  why.  come here.  i'll tell you why.  because you make me laugh, michelle.  you make me smile.  you make me feel good about caring about somebody.  i do that.  yeah, you do that.  michelle, you and i are going to be together forever, and tony's leaving tomorrow.  he is.  yes, he is, but i want you to know something.  there's going to be a lot of people in my life, but you'll always be number one.  you're going to be my best pal.  you know why.  why.  because i love you very much.  how much.  want to know how much.  i'll show you. i love you this much.  wow.  how much for me.  this much.  that much.  our arms are open.  we have to hug. it's a given.  oohooh.  michelle, i've been thinking about it.  you might need that bear more than i do.  ..  willie.  here, you can have mr. bear.  michelle, i love you so much.  everybody loves me.  that was a wet kiss.  i'm hip.  let me tell you something, michelle, that was very nice to give the bear back.  you really are a big girl.  i'm hip.  how'd we do.  we did pretty good.  want to make friends with tony.  yes, i will.  tony, you're a nice baby.  give tony a kiss.  give him a kiss.  aw. aw.  someday you'll make a great dad.  give jesse a kiss. give him a kiss.  mmm.  oh, yeah.  have mercy.  can you say, "have mercy".  can you say that.  mercy. have mercy.  you will someday.  here we go. time to go to sleep.  there you go, big tonarama.  here we go, man.  good night, tony.  aw, michelle,
