twist your arm.  no. she bent my thumb back like this.  and it really hurt.  get out, liver boy.  ok, liverace.  becky, the ring is paid for. case closed.  all right, fine, but i bought you a present, too.  remember your favorite guitar.  this is very sweet, but i can't accept it.  you'd be chipping in for your own ring.  so what.  we're talking tradition here.  man buys ring. woman wears ring.  they live haily ev after.  nowhere in the story " how am i psibly supposed to respond to that kind of twisted neanderthal logic.  say, "jesse, you're right, "you've always been right, " i'll stitch a sampler of that and hang it over the mantel.  if you don't accept the guitar, i can't accept the ring.  becky.  you don't have to be this tough, macho guy.  we're a team now, and i'd like our marriage to be an equal partnership.  so let me be as generous to you as you are to me.  it makes sense to me, but i just can't take the guitar back.  it just doesn't feel right.  how does this feel.  ow ow ow ow.  take it back.  all right, i'll take it back.  see, jess.  you were right. you've always been right.  you always will be right.  right.  toot toot.  toot toot.  having fun, michelle.  surf's up,
