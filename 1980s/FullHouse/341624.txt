 over the stupid speed limit.  mother's driving record is blemishfree and she intends to keep it that way.  i heard the museum has a new superpowerful telescope.  if it's anything like my dad's telescope, all you can see are some stewardesses lying around a swimming pool.  on that disturbing insight into your home life, it's time to go.  wait, wait, wait a second.  nobody wants to watch the most important football game of the year.  joey, don't weasel out of this.  yeah, joey. this is a noweasel zone.  we promised them an afternoon of science, and that's what we'll deliver.  look at these innocent faces. see them.  well, most of them.  there's a way the kids could learn science and i could have fun.  see, kids, this place is filled with science.  it's just like a museum.  it's "weeb's sports grill" let's blow this pop stand.  yeah. yeah.  we said we'd give him the benefit of the doubt.  where's the science, mr. wizard.  why, it's right under your noses.  take this pool table, for example, newton's law of billiards.  you see, the amount of force upon impact has a direct relationship to the distance an object will travel.  ahem.  and that, my friends, is science.  that, my friend, is a scratch.  you suckered us long enough.  we're all going to the science museum.  wait, wait, wait a sec, jess.  the game's going to start.  can't you watch the kids.  they don't want to be here.  kids, do you want to play free games for the next three hours.  see.  i don't want to be here.  i'll never ask for another favor again.  i promise.  i'll never have to tapemuppet babies for you again.  never.  ..  from now on, i'll holler out danny's name.  come on, jess, please, please.  i will get more sleep.  great.  kids, you want to play some games.  let's go.  weeb, give me 40 bucks in quarters.  uh, jess, can i have 40 bucks.  all right.  ah. change for 40.  great. now, you watch the kids.  i'll watch the game.  you are the king.  oh, look at that one.  check out the babe on the pregame show.  hi. i'm danny tanner.  and i'mrebecca donaldson.  that's no babe. that's my wife.  we're here on special assignment.  when there's a break and you don't have to use the bathroom, we'll take you behind the scenes.  that's right, danny.  right behind this door is the control room for joe robbie stadium's stateoftheart scoreboard.  we're going to go inside and give you an exclusive peek at what makes this computerized marvel tick.  who would've thought this sophisticated piece of machinery could be run by a simple mop.  well, that doesn't seem to be the correct door.  i believe the correct door would be down that corridor, where i suggested we go in the first place.  i have a suggestion where you can go, but first let's go back to al, dan, and frank.  oh, terrific job, beck.  you see, when she smiles, she lights up a wholebring on the football guys.  the guys that throw the thingyes, what.  uncle jesse, this whole trip is totally bogus.  joey's obsessed with this football stuff.  you think i want to be with some loudmouthed, peabrained, ..  who could take this pool cue and turn me into a jesskebab.  michelle, run along.  you don't want to be privy to this.  michelle, what is the probability of our science club actually doing something sciencerelated.  yeah. let's do something scientific.  besides, we're out of quarters.  let's ask your uncle slick for more.  now might not be a good time.  ..  i hate to bother you, but i'm losing all feeling below my hairline.  good. that's better. thanks.  good, yeah, thanks.  joey, remind me to kill you later.  great, jess, sure.  idiot.  hey, there's nobody watching this tv.  let's watch the science channel.  it's 27. i memorized the entire cable lineup.  oh, here's the remote.  here we go. it's kickoff time.  yeah.  it's a high kick.  it's taken at the goal line.  is there anything more fascinating than the mating dance of the bluefooted booby.  hey, who turned the channel.  yeah. i want to thank him. thank you.  it's those kids.  that's interesting.  this remote seems to control all the tvs.  get that remote.  yeah.  no, thanks. i pass.  come and get it, fun boys.  get that little whippersnapper.  all right, justwe'll get it back.  ha ha ha.  o.k. no harm done. i'll get the remote.  it's just a little kickoff mischief.  .  grrr.  sorry, weeb.  you had some lint on one of your neck rolls.  i got it.  joey, help me get it behind here.  all right.  there it is.  oh, man.  i think i'll ask them to kill you first.  that way i'll be able to watch.  on the plus side, i found

please, weeb.  it's o.k., weeby. it's just a silly game.  silly game.  i broke 11 bones playing that silly game.  wow. was it painful.  i don't know.  they weren't mine.  they weren't yours. no.  i wish i had more insurance.  hey, since you guys can't watch the game, maybe you'd like to come to the science museum with us.  that's a real good idea, sweetheart.  now we can stuff and mount these clowns.  stuff 'em.  no mounting.  no stuffing.  please.  i have an idea.  he's got an idea.  yes, i do.  deej, hi.  how'd your interview go.  i haven't had it yet.  the woman called. she's going to be late.  ooh, late.  late is bad.  turn on the tube.  watercress sandwiches.  just like mom's.  those aren't for you.  don't disturb them while they're feeding.  joey, who are these people.  they want to see the game, and i want to see the rest of my life.  some field trip.  what are you guys doing back so soon.  she promised us the museum, but all we've seen is a lot of wet bar change.  like this is my idea of a fun day.  i believe the blame rests squarely upon the shoulders of our adult chaperons.  what. don't blame me.  i was trying to help out footballbrain.  uncle jesse, we've got to learn something.  after all, the motto of our science club is " and i will teach you something.  you're kids, i'm a grownup.  i should know more than you.  but you don't.  well, i know your parents would have more spending money if you were in a crate going to siberia.  teach them to climb the stairs.  my interviewer will be here any minute.  keep them occupied.  and, joey, joey, get these people into the kitchen.  d.j., there's no tv in there.  what will we watch, the freezer.  hey. ohh.  offsides.  o.k. our collage has antelopes and zebras.  do you know other animals that travel in packs.  no.  i mean, yes.  who are they.  joey brought some friends over to play.  hey, look. it's that clown again.  thanks forthe second chance.  that's no clown. that's my dad.  we finally found the scoreboard, and it's clearly marked " which is what we are.  why don't we take an authorized peek inside, danny.  this is exciting.   well, i guess we're not as authorized as we thought.  while we straighten this out, why don't we throw it back to you, al, frank, and dan.  i thought you got clearance.  your job was clearance.  i made the dinner reservations.  uhoh.  that joker's your dad.  uh, no, no.  you fell for the old "that's my dad" routine.  better watch, or i'll get your nose.  you lovable lugs are just too darn easy.  yeah.  o.k., boys, let's go upstairs.  that was your dad.  shh. that was also your mom.  shh. shh.  .  if you get the proper ph balance in your shampoo, when you get to this stage, your scalp should be what, derek.  tingling like pins and needles.  this concludes our little scientific presentation.  what have you learned today.  that joey's the smart one.  at least he's watching the super bowl.  yeah. who cares how split ends split.  today's shot. let's go watch the game.  we can watch derek shampoo anytime.  kids, if i can stress anything, it's condition.  it really iscondition, condition, condition.  where's the tv and all those guys with no lives.  uncle jesse, you're supposed to keep them busy upstairs.  i tried, but kids these days, they'll spend two, three hours on their homework, but spend time on scalp maintenance, and they look at you like you're a nut.  that's the look.  she'll be here any minute.  what should i do.  take them into the kitchen.  beauty school dropouts, follow me into the kitchen.  right this way.  i seem to have been left high and not quite dry.  out, out, out.  come on, out, out.  sit down, sit down.  ow.   there's a lady out there with a briefcase.  that's my interview.  out. everybody, out.  joey, get them out.  i know the drill. road trip.  hurry up, let's go.  come on. we're missing the game.   i'll be right there.  just one second.  hello. i'm norma bedrosian.  hi. i'm d.j. tanner.  i parked in back if that's o.k.  no problem.   would you excuse me for just one second.   shut up.  ahem.  sorry. i just had to clear my throat there.  uh, please have a seat.  thank you.  we at the scholarship foundation are interested in people who are serious about their academic careers.  you and me both.  many students think that college is just one big party.  oh, no, not me.  i don't even think about partying.  i don't even know anyone who parties.  deej, there you are.  why didn't you tell me you were having a wild party.  do i know you.  oh, you must be the scholarship babe.  hey, if you've got any extra bucks, throw a little cash my way.  i'm going to graduate magna come and get her.  who is this young woman.  oh, i'm d.j.'s best pal.  we're inseparable.  ..  like spam and tang.  spam, out.  out, out.  see ya, tang.   is it possible there's a super bowl party going on in there.  uh, notouchdown.   yes.  but it's not my party.  i don't like football at all.  i'd much rather study.  football's so barbaric and stupid and pointless.  what a shame because i love football.  as do i.  you didn't let me finish.  if my car hadn't broken down, i'd be watching the game.  let's cut to the chase.  your grades are excellent, your essay was superlative.  you got the scholarship.  ii'm sure you'll make us all very proud.  now to the game.  right.  nacho cheese. you gotta love it.   any room in here for another football fan.  norma. norma.  why aren't you guys at weeb's.  aw, because of beavis and butthead here.  don't blame beavis. it's butthead's fault.   huh huh huh huh huh.  come on. it didn't work out so bad.  it's a great game, and everyone's having fun.  yeah. yeah.  yeah, right.  well, not everyone.  i'll get it.  i'll go.  i'll go with you.  no, i'll stay and watch the rest of the game.  hey, michelle.  hey, listen, you and i have to have a little talk.  i know you're a little disappointed about not going to the science museum.  a little disappointed.  i was a little disappointed when they stopped making the mcrib.  right now i'm a lot disappointed.  o.k. a lot disappointed.  o.k. i can deal with that.  all right.  i know.  ..  sometimes things don't always work out the way you planned.  you'll have to learn how to handle that.  do you understand, sweetheart.  like if someone wanted to watch the super bowl but promised to do something else, they should learn how to handle that.  this little lesson just took an unexpected turn.  yeah, i guess i was a little selfish, huh.  i guess so.  oh, boy. i ruined your day.  i ruined everyone's day just 'cause i was obsessed about a football game.  what's the big deal with the super bowl.  well, it's exciting. it's fun.  it's the biggest day of aerosol cheese consumption in the world.  but that's no excuse.  the most important thing is keeping a promise, and i apologize, michelle.  i'm sorry.  hey, look, let's forget about the super bowl.  we can still go to the museum and learn about the atom and make fun of einstein's hair.  thanks, joey, but i think it's too late.  maybe we can go next week.  deal.  early in the morning.  sure, why not.  for the whole day.  till they throw us out.  good. i think we understand each other now.  i think so.  tonight i want you to think about our talk.  i'll be thinking.  touchdown.   boy, that sounded like a big play.  well, it is the super bowl.  what are we waiting for.  let's go. come on. it's the super bowl.  captioning performed bythe national captioning institute, inc.  this.  it's chewy.  really icy.  wooh. that's intense.  it just hits you.  its
