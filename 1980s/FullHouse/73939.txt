 let's sit with the guys.  have fun. we'll meet you at the car at 8:30.  steve.  what.  and steve in that nice, quiet booth.  why.  the team's over by the door.  the draft could tighten up my pitching arm.  do you want me to tell coach zwick it's your fault i can't pitch.  the booth looks fine.  hi, guys.  what are you doing here.  we'd rather sit in the booth.  vinyl's so much cozier.  i love the way that tshirt looks on you.  it's got a big sloppy joe stain on it.  oh, well, it really brings out the color in your eyes.  so what do you recommend.  i recommend another table.  steph, i'm going to the bathroom.  do you want to join me.  no, that's o.k. josh might get lonely.  hey, if you got to go, you got to go.  she's definitely got to go.  stephanie, why are you sitting at our table.  i thought you were sitting with your friends.  if we sit with the team, he'll only think of baseball.  i've got to make him think about romance.  if i don't, he won't.  then sit by yourselves.  i don't know anything about romance.  .  you only go on your first date once.  it's got to be perfect.  o.k., relax. don't push so hard.  by the way, it's me you're playing footsies with under the table.  i missed you, deej.  i missed you, too.  i missed you, josh.  you were only gone for two seconds.  wow. your hand's sweating like a pig.  oh, josh, what a marvelous sense of humor.  what is it it's called wilderness man.  comes with a free bag of beef jerky.  i like your cologne, too, josh.  i don't wear cologne.  you're probably smelling my denorex.  ..  even from up here.  boy, everything smells so good.  thanks, vicky.  i checked on nicky and alex.  they're sleeping like babies, which is good.  i guess it's the nurturing side of me.  or the side that didn't want to set the table.  she's kidding. we kid each other.  that's the kind of relationship we have.  salad, alison.  ..   i'll get that.  thanks, joey.  vicky, i got a big surprise for you.  remember the first meal i cooked for you.  that mushedupturkeywiththepureedvegetablesinthatdough thing.  turkey in a boot. you remembered.  boy, isn't this a beauty, huh.  joey.  ..  my wonderful, crusty boot.  listen, i'll take care of this.  anyone for turkey in a loafer.  joey, forget about that.  let me do it for you.  honey, pase, let me do it.  i know you had a hard day at work.  i'm not too macho to clean.  how many times have i told you.  counting now, once.  again she kids.  vicky, ii am so sorry.  i know turkey in a boot is your favorite meal.  sweetheart, it's not my favorite.  the first time i made it for you, you said you loved it.  i lied.  the truth is it tastes like it sounds.  i'm sorry.  we'd just started going out, and i didn't want to hurt your feelings.  i'm sure there's some fibs you've told me to spare my feelings.  remember when i told you i liked that pink pullover you knitted me.  you didn't like that sweater.  i didn't like it.  i loved it.  did i miss a food fight.  no, just a little accident, michelle.  .. excuse me, jess.  uh, this is alison. alison, michelle.  hi.  hi, michelle.  joey.  yeah, yeah.  what.  what are you doing.  you feel cool.  you said that you had the hots for her.  well, maybe you misunderstood me.  you're alison, right.  yes.  he has the hots for you.  oh, boy, we'll always remember our first date.  we're not on a date.  i thought i was just coming over for dinner.  boy, will you look at the time.  michelle, you have to go to bed, don't you.  was is something i said.  nothing you said at all.  this is really embarrassing.  um, maybe this wasn't such a good idea.  it's nice meeting you.  nice meeting you, too.  alison.  alison, hold on a second.  i really should be going.  give joey a second chance.  he's really a nice guy.  i know he's a nice guy.  sit down here a second.  what you don't know is how much he likes you.  sometimes it's hard for us guys to show our feelings.  it comes out weird.  instead of joey just saying, "i dig you," he dumps salad all over you.  it certainly got my attention.  listen, i love joey like a brother.  he's the warmest, sweetest guy.  he's like a big teddy bear you just want to hug.  once you know him, you'll love him, too.  i swear.  jesse, i have something to say.  am i in trouble again.  no.  i think i misjudged you.  you're a good friend to joey.  you're so open and in touch with your feelings.  well, it's no biggie.  i guess it's just the kind of guy i am.  i really feel like i've been talking to one of my girlfriends.  that's not the kind of guy i am.  oh, great, alison, you're still here.  why don't you guys sit down and talk to each other.  reallysit down, talk a little, enjoy ea other, go.  alison, look, i'm really sorry if i came on too strong.  i just want to assure you that in the future all of our dealings will be strictly on a professional level, ..  sir.  ..  it doesn't have anything to do with you.  i just came off a bad relationship, and i just need a little more time.  how's that. is that good.  more than that.  that's o.k., i can wait. don't worry.  so you must be starving.  i think there's something in the kitchen i haven't thrown on the floor yet.   coffee, anyone.  joey.   ..ohh, bad luck.  ..  maybe we should go to a rubberpadded restaurant, someplace where i can't break anything.  we'll go and have dessert.  think they're going to be through soon.  steve's got to drive me home.  well, while we're waiting, you know what would be the perfect end to a perfect evening.  you're going to teach me how to throw a knuckleball.  ..  what did you do that for.  i don't know.  steve, i'd better go talk to her.  steve, do you understand women.  well, enough not to wipe my mouth off when they kiss me.  ] sweet brownies layers of brownie and caramel,
