that i'm taking this film class, i can appreciate the symbolism, the metaphor, the subtext.  steve, we saw ernest gets a bee bite.  you two actually watched the movie.  kimmy, a relationship isn't just making out.  oh, my god. you're serious.  let's get out of here before we get boring.  that is so far off.  so, you want to watch tv.  i got the remote tonight.  .  i got to talk to you about something.  my film class is going to l.a.  for a seminar next week.  next week.  that's my school vacation.  i thought we'd be together.  i feel terrible, but my professor picked me and five other people out of the class.  she says i have a critical eye.  that's because whenever she shows a film, " you're not laughing. all right. i'll stay.  no. go. it's a good opportunity for you.  thanks, deej. you're the best.  what is going on here.  why is everyone so tired.  i'd ask nicky and alex, but i don't want to wake them.  where the heck's the newspaper at.  i checked all the usual placesthe hedge, under the car, gibbler's coffee table.   top o' the mornin' to ya.  where's me lucky charms.  hey, you guys won't believe this.  i was driving to the health club.  00 in the morning.  ..8:00. look.  ha ha ha ha.  april fools.  morning breath.  it isn't even april yet.  i know, but every year when i try and catch you guys with an april fools joke, you expect it.  this, however, was brilliant.  you were totally surprised.  i changed every watch and clock in the house.  i knew it was too early.  when i woke up, i didn't even need to go to the bathroom.  i think i speak for everyone in the house when i say, pack your bags.  get out.  yeah. yeah, joey.  come on. it was a joke.  isn't anybody a good sport.  forget it. you're going down, gladstone.  this was absolutely ridiculous.  look on the bright side.  we get a little extra sleep.  top o' the day to ya. ha ha.  i'll get the kids.  good morning. good morning.  time for breakfast.  no, it's not time for breakfast.  now, listen, there's been a little mixup here, and we're going to get some more sleep.  no sleep. no sleep. no sleep. no sleep.  no sleep. no sleep.  yes, sleep. yes, sleep.  yes, sleep. yes, sleep.  no sleep. no sleep.  no sleep. no sleep.  think i'll put them in joey's bed.  no sleep. no sleep.  yes, sleep. yes, sleep.  yes, sleep.  hey, deej, aren't you going back to bed.  i can't sleep.  what's the problem.  it's me and steve.  you should see kimmy and keanu.  you have to pry them apart with the jaws of life.  steve and i used to be like that.  we never wanted to be apart.  it's normal for a relationship to go through stages.  the first stage is always hot because it's new.  and when it's not so new.  then you have to find out if you have more than the initial attraction, if you have the same interests.  you and uncle jesse have been together forever, and you're still hot for each other.  that's one of our interests.  come on. it's going to be a great party.  i can't. steve's going to call from l.a.  besides, i'd feel weird by myself.  you'll be with us.  you'll be making out all night.  at least come with us tomorrow.  we're going to climb eagle mountain.  thanks, but i'm more of a mall dweller.  suit yourself.  let's get to the party before all the good couches are taken.  hey, deej.  hey.  hey, deej, since you're babysitting tonight, we have got an important job for you.  we've figured out a trick to play on joey.  it's operation payback.  great. how does it work.  you know how every week joey buys lottery tickets and thinks he's going to make the big score.  we're going to make him think he did.  that's kind of cruel.  exactly.  now, your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to tape the lottery show tonight.  then we'll get the same numbers and switch that ticket with joey's ticket.  when he watches the drawing, we play the tape.  the numbers match exactly, he thinks he's a zillionaire, and it's shaft city.  we tell him he didn't win and laugh at him like he laughed at us.  no, no, no, no. we laugh much harder.  well, it looks like you're my saturday night dates.  what do you want to do.  i want to be a

lover boy.  i can't move.  i'm too scared.  why did i ever do this.  you didn't want to be stuck at home while steve's sharing phones with the rich and sexy.  yeah, but i don't want to be stuck on this ledge, either.  deej, you got to face this fear.  what's the worst that could happen.  ..  i could fall and be splattered into thousands of little pieces on these very hard pointy rocks.  there you go.  ahh.  deej, you did it.  i did do it.  i conquered my fear.  ..  look at this view.  you can see forever.  this is spectacular.  i feel like i'm on top of the world.  deej, will you stop yakking.  you're killing the mood.  i can't believe i almost missed this.  you know, in some weird way, kimmy, i couldn't have done this without you.  hey, you taught me how to shave my pits.  what goes around comes around.  hi, d.j.  steve.  what are you doing here.  ..  for about three hours.  i came home today. we had a date, remember.  oh, it's saturday.  you're home from l.a.  i don't know what happened to this week.  i've been so busy.  it's nice to know you missed me.  i'm sorry. i've just been doing so much stuff.  i even hung out with steph and michelle.  i forgot how much i liked them.  did you forget you had a boyfriend.  ..  but my whole life doesn't revolve around you.  yeah. it revolves around us.  uh, we'll be upstairs if you need us.  you know, i know what this is about.  you're trying to get back at me for going to l.a.  i'm not trying to get back at you.  you share one phone with suzanne somers, and you think you're mr. hollywood.  i cannot believe that you are jealous of me and suzanne.  jealous.  ..  go home.  ..  but it's not because you told me to.  it's because my mom said not to be late for dinner.  and i don't intend to be.  o.k., joejoe, time for the

another reason more people stay with state farm.  get to a better state.  . .  ..  what are you doing up.  steve and i had a fight.  oh.  it just feels like we're not on the same wavelength anymore.  is that how it felt when you and vicky broke up.  well, yeah.  sometimes people in relationships just go off in different directions.  yeah, i think that's the problem with me and steve.  when i was on that mountain, something inside of me changed.  i just realized that i've been with steve so long that i was forgetting who i was.  well, maybe you have to, you know, talk to steve and try to make him understand how you're feeling.  you're right.  it's nice having these talks without being in trouble.  if it'll make you feel any better, i could ground you for a couple weeks.  you're the best.  oh, i am, aren't i.  well, what do you think.  i think there should be an elevator there.  steve, come on, look around.  don't you feel exhilarated.  don't you feel overwhelmed.  don't you feel anything.  well, you know, i feel like a chili dog.  forget it.  deej, i was just kidding.  yeah, but i'm serious.  what's the problem.  it's us.  it's like somebody let the air out of our relationship.  don't you feel it.  ..  well, i'll admit that things aren't like they used to be, but i was willing never to bring it up.  not talking about it won't make it go away.  you know, there's something missing between us.  i know.  i was thinking about that in l.a.  we're not connecting like we used to, but we still have fun, we get to hang out, we talk.  ..  where's the heat.  i mean, where's that passion that we used to have.  what you're talking about is a friendship.  it's not a romance.  so what are you saying, we should break up.  that's a scary thought.  i know.  it scares me, too.  you're the first guy that i ever loved.  ..  ..  until i actually did it, and then it was incredible.  i understand, deej.  i mean, you're my first love, too, but we can't stay together just 'cause we're afraid to break up.  yeah, because if we did, we could both be missing out on other incredible things.  yeah, but we'd lose something incredible, toous.  no, we'll never lose us, and we'll always be friends.  ..  you're the best friend i ever had.  did we just break up.  yeah, i think so.  what's next.  i guess we should, um, we should just head down and face the world.  deej, are you coming.  go ahead. i'll catch up.  are you sure.  yeah. i just need a minute.  i'll be o.k. )
