 ..  my mom would never let me have a party without adult supervision.  which is why i didn't tell her.   rush hour renegades    comin' at ya   all right. we are the rush hour renegades.  i'm jesse.  i'm joey.  joey, i've told you to finish your chocolate boing boing before you talk on the radio.  our guest is here.  ladies and gentlemen, it's barry williams.  barry williams.  barry, how you doing.  that's great.  you guys remember barry as greg from the dynamite show the brady bunch.  we got to ask you some great brady questions if we may.  i'll tell you what.  i'll answer all your brady questions, but first let's talk about the new band i put together.  oh, putting the old brady kids back together with the polyester jumpsuits.  we better gas up the old eighttrack machine.  actually, i met some local musicians.  we started jamming.  one thing led to another, and we put out a new cd.  in fact, i was hoping you guys would play it.  it would be an honor.  ladies and gentlemen, we're going to hear the latest right now ..  the rippers.  well, now, isn't that a winky dink of a coincidence.  jesse was dumped by a band called the rippers.  oh, i'm sure it was a different band.  these guys got rid of their singer because he spent more time moussing his hair than playing his guitar.  you try keeping this cowlick down with just gel.  it doesn't work, man.  i'm sorry. i didn't know it was you.  if you don't want to play the song, i understand completely.  barry, barry, please, i'm above this.  that's fine. let's give this song a shot.  ththat's fine.  ..  ..  the rippers.    a hundred januarys gone    and i'm still in my shell   ..    i'd say it'sit's not bad. it's not bad.  but, listen, barry, buddy, former brady, i've been in the music business for a long time.  .   'cause i've seen the cabin fever setting in    and all the april girls    well, they never look at me    no, they never look at me    but i love them anyway    the empty pantry in my head   ..   oh, uncle jesse, i'll just change the station.  no, no, deej. no, fine.  you don't have to.  they've been playing this song all day.   april girls    well, they never look at me   what are the odds.  buenas noches, amigos.  that's better.  y ahora barry y los rippers.  f you know, we never talk anymore.  how was your day.  you're trying to be sensitive, but i'm totally cool with this.  i liked the rippers better when uncle jesse ..  that's sweet, munchkin.  before they had a hit song and everybody loved them and they opened for the stonesthey're opening for the stones.  only on the west coast.  uh, michelle, i think that's all the cheering up uncle jesse can stand right now.  gotcha.  come on, let's go.  thanks, guys, but this is no big deal.  who needs a hit record.  in fact, who needs music.  you're giving up music.  in fact, i may never play another note as long as i live.  my life is full and rich.  it's time to start concentrating on the important things in life.  so this

talked with jesse's friends and family to find out more about this truly pathetic figure.  o.k., all right, so i married a failure.  i can deal with it, but it's been really hard on the boys.  they're so ashamed.  i don't know where the reject is today, and, frankly, i don't care.  all that's left of him is an elvis doughnut maker and a mousse slick on the couch.  i never believed he was my uncle.  i just thought he was this guy who used our combs.  the day he left, he took all the hair dryers, but it's a small price to pay to have him out of our lives.  happy blowing, greaseball.  he always called me munchkin.  i used to think it was cute, but then i found out what it meanta short, funnylooking person.  what a jerk.  i was jesse's partner on the radio and his best friend.  now, i'm dating his wife.  boing boing, honey.  you bet, honey.  last week, in adownbeatexclusive, our tragicam finally caught up with jesse katsopolis.  what do you people want from me.  x7 since you gave up your music, you lost everything you cared about.  i don't need music.  my life is good now.  ..  sure, i've put on a few pounds, ..  nasty scalp infection.  but i'm getting it together.  all right.  i

a third choice.  i got to go change my eye.  .  i had this horrific dream.  i realize i need music in my life.  next to you and the boys, it's the most important thing to me.  i'd say you had a very successful nap.  i'm going to stop obsessing over this rippers thing, otherwise i'll end up a fat, pathetic hasbeen with a scalp infection.  by the way, how is my hair.  perfect, as usual.  honey,
