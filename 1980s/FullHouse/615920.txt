 thanks to danny, i have an ontheair tryout to be the new mr. egghead.  fantastic.  great.  you'll be mr. egghead.  he's the smartest person on television, next to connie chung.  egghead has to know everything about science.  well, not that you don't know everything ..  do you know anything about science.  is captain kangaroo a real captain.  hey, he's not even a real kangaroo.  all i have to do is be hip, funny, and follow the script.  with jesse as my sidekick, how can i miss.  .. sidekick.  ..  1.  sidekick.  right on time.  i just want to have a hip, musical sidekick.  you know, like david letterman has paul shaffer.  mr. egghead has the professor.  i don't do kiddie shows.  it's just for the tryout.  fine. you don't want to be the professor.  just think of all those kids who'll have to learn science without any music.  they'll be too sad to play with their pets.  that is the stupidest story i've ever heard.  besides, guilt doesn't work on me.  then i'll badger and pester you until you say you'll do it.  will you do it.  will you do it.  will you do it.  all right. i'll do it.  ok, if it'll make you happy.  dad, don't you think maybe we're overdoing this blue thing.  it's been psychologically proven that judges are more sympathetic to people wearing blue.  that's why you never see a smurf on death row.  tomorrow's class picture day, friday is pizza day, and today my class gets to see joey on themr. eggheadshow.  i love my life.  i can't believe someone i actually know is going to have their own tv show.  ..  honey, uh, i have my own tv showwake up, san francisco.  but this is a show that people i know watch.  see ya.  let's practice for court.  first thing, they'll swear you in.  please place your right hand on fred savage.  anytime.  what was that.  oh, nothing.  you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.  i fred. i mean, i do.  tanner, please step into the witness stand and explain to judge bear here everything that happened in every detail.  i will demonstrate with these easytofollow visual aids.  ok.  ms. tanner.  my dad and i were driving north on fremont.  my dad was cleaning between the buttons on the car radio.  ..  there's no need to bring up that minor detail.  i can't lie to the judge.  if the judge asks you directly, "was your father dusting the buttons on the " then you can say yes.  we came to a corner, and there was a "right turn only" sign.  except we couldn't see it because of a bush.  now our big finish.  the face of truth and innocence.  ..  1.  egghead    you scientific dude    whenever you're around    i'm in a scientific mood    you can tell us how the bird flies    or how the fungus grows    the creation of the universe    or how we blow our nose    yes, you know everything    under the sun   egghead    for making learning fun   and now here he is, the man who knows everything, mr. egghead.  yay. yay.  eggstremely kind of you.  thank you, professor.  ain't no thing, mr. egghead.  greetings, junior eggheads.  greetings, mr. egghead.  welcome to the new, improvedmr. eggheadshow.  my special guests in the egg carton today hardesty's second grade class at frazier street elementary school.  hi. hi. hi.  don't eggshaust yourself, " professor, let's find out who has our first scientific question.  me. me.  me. me.  the scholarlylooking gentleman three eggs in.  what happened to the old mr. egghead.  well, he's, uh, on vacation.  i read in the newspaper that he didn't pay his taxes.  well, he's on vacation for three to five years.  and so ends another fascinating segment " it's time to discuss our topic of the dayenergy.  yay. yay.  how about a little energy music, professor.  ok, mr. egg rollegghead. sorry.  we're all wondering what eggsactly is energy.  eggsellent question, professor.  well, to put it in its simplest terms, energy is the ability to do work.  energy is all around us.  why, energy is in the sun.   energy is in our muscles.   hey, mr. egghead.  why, energy is even in walter.  sorry to interrupt, but i've been wonderingif the speed of light is based on the theory that light has a finite velocity, how would that calculate in a black hole.  let's let the professor field this one.  ..  well, son, i'm going to tell you the same thing my father told me when i was young.  look it up.  well put, professor.  and now it's time to pick one special junior egghead to help me with an eggsperiment about energy.  me. me.  oh, here's a pretty young egghead.  thanks, joey.  it's mr. egghead.  hey, they live in the same house.  this is a fix.  fix. fix.  fix. fix.   fix, fix, fix, fix    fix, fix, fix, fix    fix, fix, fix, fix    fix. fix. fix.  don't egg them on, professor.  young lady, tell everyone your name.  stephanie judith tanner, and i'm very eggcited to be here.  eggscellent.  let's take a look at how energy works, shall we.  over here, we have your ordinary boxing glove on a spring.  now, when i pull the lever and release the spring, its stored energy becomes kinetic energy propelling the boxing glove into proton the clown's face.   now, lovely assistant, pull the lever, release the energy, and learn.  it's stuck.  .. because, as we say in the laboratory...   something's wrong.  aw. aw. aw.  this never happened to the real mr. egghead.  walter, why don't you take a journey through the eggsxit.  i'll
