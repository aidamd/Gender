 don't you and your boyfriend have an anniversary to celebrate.  i don't understand why you're so jealous of steve.  you think i'm jealous.  you don't know me at all.  she left.  can you blame her.  i apologized.  there's no law that says you have to throw your friend a birthday party.  deej, it's not just about a birthday party.  you know, since steve's been your boyfriend, kimmy's been left out.  you've been dating steve six months.  you've been friends with kimmy for six years.  seven.  i think you're still blocking out 1989.  ..  in life, if you're lucky, you wind up with a few really good friends.  for some reason, beyond my realm of understanding, kimmy is yours.  just like joey and jesse are mine.  with friends, you really have to come through for them.  when i needed them to raise you girls, they were here in a second.  of course, they didn't know a diaper from a dinner napkin, which made for some interesting meals.  but they were here.  i'd have been there for them.  you ought to be there for kimmy.  i'll go next door and talk to her.  that's my girl.  , you go talk to kimmy, and i'll talk to steve, sugar lips.  what are you doing here.  well, i can't go home.  my parents think you're throwing me a party.  i'd look like a dork coming in at 8:30.  kimmy, i'm really sorry i forgot your birthday.  it was lousy, and i'll never forgive myself for hurting your feelings.  never.  never.  will it eat at you, tormenting you, like my dad after a bunch of bad clams.  don't put me through this.  you put me through the most humiliating night of my life.  you forgot my birthday, and accused me of being jealous of your boyfriend.  i should have never said that.  that really hurt because i'm not jealous.  steve's a great guy, and i'm happy for you.  i just miss you.  it's like you have a new best friend.  ..you are my best friend.  you always will be.  there's so much i can do with you i can't do with steve.  like what.  like talk about steve.  steve and i can't go through each other's closets.  he has nothing in my size.  believe me, kimmy, no one could take your place.  i guess i am one of a kind.  kimmy, you and i have been best friends since the day you moved next door.  i want to stay best friends forever.  you mean it.  thanks, deej.  hey, how about next friday night, just you and me.  we'll go out for your birthday.  sounds great.  want to go back to the party.  any hashed browned cake left.  oh, i can pretty much guarantee it.  captioning performed bythe national captioning institute, inc.  captions copyright 1993warner bros. inc.  public
