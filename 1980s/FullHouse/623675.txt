the best part is the view.  you'll love the view.  there's this beautiful lake..over.  manny says not to leave the equipment in the car.  seems this neighborhood's not as nice as these lovely rooms would suggest.  can we watch tv, daddy.  please, please, please, please.  yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.  yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.  just grab the remote.  why would you want a remote ..  or, uh,

spying on me.  why were you sneaking around.  because i know how you feel about viper.  you're always putting him down.  you called him an animal.  he's the reason they invented restraining orders.  you're doing it again.  he's not the kind of guy you should be dating.  i'm almost 18.  you can't exactly tell me who to date.  i'm telling you who not to date.  i knew you'd flip out.  i'm not flipping out, and i'm not giving you my car so you can see this guy.  fine. i'll go in kimmy's.  now i'm flipping out.  our new flatbread sandwiches may be flat...  the flavors, are anything but.  so

to matlock.  do you think my mother was happy when i started dating you.  i had to show her you were more than long hair, rock 'n' roll, and a harley.  there's more to viper, too.  yeah. have you seen him in tight jeans.  hey, kimmy, free pickled pig feet at the bar.  i'm there.  hey.  hey, hey.  ..  nobody was speaking of polkas.  perhaps we should.  why aren't you in your polka costume.  why
