have.  salad, alison.  ..   i'll get that.  thanks, joey.  vicky, i got a big surprise for you.  remember the first meal i cooked for you.  that mushedupturkeywiththepureedvegetablesinthatdough thing.  turkey in a boot. you remembered.  boy, isn't this a beauty, huh.  joey.  ..  my wonderful, crusty boot.  listen, i'll take care of this.  anyone for turkey in a loafer.  joey, forget about that.  let me do it for you.  honey, please, let me do it.  i know you had a hard day at work.  i'm not too macho to clean.  how many times have i told you.  counting now, once.  again she kids.  vicky, ii am so sorry.  i know turkey in a boot is your favorite meal.  sweetheart, it's not my favorite.  the first time i made it for you, you said you loved it.  i lied.  the truth is, it tastes like it sounds.  i'm sorry.  we'd just started going out, and i didn't want to hurt your feelings.  i'm sure there's some fibs you've told me to spare my feelings.  remember when i told you i liked that pink pullover you knitted me.  you didn't like that sweater.  i didn't like it.  i loved it.  did i miss a food fight.  no, just a little accident, michelle.  .. excuse me, jess.  uh, this is alison. alison, michelle.  hi.  hi, michelle.  joey.  yeah, yeah.  what.  what are you doing.  you feel cool.  you said that you had the hots for her.  well, maybe you misunderstood me.  you're alison, right.  yes.  he has the hots for you.  oh, boy, we'll always remember our first date.  we're not on a date.  i thought i was just coming over for dinner.  boy, will you look at the time.  michelle, you have to go to bed, don't you.  was is something i said.  nothing you said at all.  this is really embarrassing.  um, maybe this wpjn't such a good idea.  it's nice meeting you.  nice meeting you, too.  alison.  alison, hold on a second.  i really should be going.  give joey a second chance.  he's really a nice guy.  i know he's a nice guy.  sit down here a second.  what you don't know is how much he likes you.  sometimes it's hard for us guys to show our feelings.  it comes out weird.  instead of joey just saying, "i dig you," he dumps salad all over you.  it certainly got my attention.  listen, i love joey like a brother.  he's the warmest, sweetest guy.  he's like a big teddy bear you just want to hug.  once you know him, you'll love him, too.  i swear.  jesse, i have something to say.  am i in trouble again.  no.  i think i misjudged you.  you're a good friend to joey.  you're so open and in touch with your feelings.  well, it's no biggie.  i guess it's just the kind of guy i am.  i really feel like i've been talking to one of my girlfriends.  that's not the kind of guy i am.  oh, great, alison, you're still here.  why don't you guys sit down and talk teach other reallysit down, talk a little, enjoy each other, go.  alison, look, i'm really sorry if i came on too strong.  i just want to assure you that in the future all of our dealings will be strictly on a professional level, ..  sir.  ..  it doesn't have anything to do with you.  i just came off a bad relationship, and i just need a little more time.  how's that. is that good.  more than that.  that's o.k., i can wait. don't worry.  so you must be starving.  i think there's something in the kitchen i haven't thrown on the floor yet.   coffee, anyone.  joey.   ..ohh, bad luck.  ..  maybe we should go to a rubberpadded restaurant, someplace where i can't break anything.  we'll go and have dessert.  think they're going to be through soon.  steve's got to drive me home.  well, while we're waiting, you know what would be the perfect end to a perfect evening.  you're going to teach me how to throw a knuckleball.  ..  what did you do that for.  i don't know.  steve, i'd better go talk to her.  h4 steve, do you understand women.  well, enough not to wipe my mouth off when they kiss me.  .  this was the worst night of my life.  shh. you'll wake up michelle.  too late, michelle's awake.  i need to talk to stephanie.  good. then i'll help.  steph, i know how you're feeling.  you're hurt and confused.  you forgot humiliated, crushed, and scarred for life.  steph, don't take it so hard.  it was only your first date.  i'm never leaving this room again.  not even to go to the bathroom.  michelle.  what was i thinking. why did i kiss him.  you kissed a boy.  eew. cooties.  michelle, let me handle this.  ..  but you're not doing a very good job.  steph, why did you kiss josh.  i thought i was supposed to.  that's what you and steve do.  that's what it said inteen week.  you're not a teen.  steve and i do it because we want to, not because we're supposed to.  well, how do you know when you want to, and he wants to, and how long to.  i can't explain it.  when you're ready, you'll know.  all i know is, i was not ready tonight.  steph, that's not a bad thing.  it was tonight.  you were going too fast.  it was partly my fault.  i never should have told you it was a date.  josh was just a friend that wanted to hang out.  that's what i thought in the first place.  you think josh will ever talk to me again.  you're pretty, smart, funny.  really. you think so.  sure, i do, and you're the only one who can teach him that knuckleball.  thanks, deej. you're the best.
