day.  he bought it.  how was your day, michelle.  ..  we're busted.  , and i won a dingdong.  yes.  that's great.  let me get a tissue and wipe your nose.  ..  but good liars.  since you girls were cooped up in the house, let's go to a movie tonight.  uhoh, he knowssomething.  how about the littlest sea lion.  have you girls seen it.  no, dad, i can honestly say we haven't.  you know, deej, since you're becoming so responsible, maybe it's time i raised your allowance.  i don't deserve a raise.  how does 2.50 more a week sound.  it sounds great.  why is he torturing me.  i love you, sweetheart.  i can't take it anymore.  i can't take it anymore.  dad, steve came over.  we took stephanie and michelle to the movies.  we didn't have enough money for their tickets, so i made kimmy sneak them in, then we got caught.  i forced them to lie to you about it.  i feel so much better.  ..that's a bad face.  i'm really sorry, dad.  so am i. i can't believe this.  the whole thing about the baloney sandwich.  never happened.  go ahead, dad. ground me.  all three of you.  we're all grounded.  even me, your little princess.  they don't deserve it.  i told them they weren't lying, just telling a fiblet.  they went along with it.  ultimately, you're each responsible for the choices you made.  you're going to have to accept the consequences.  huh.  that means, you do the crime, you do the time.  does this mean no little sea lion.  nolittle sea lion.  that's the second time i missed him today.  deej, what happened.  we got away with the whole thing, then you blew it.  i couldn't go through with it.  ever hear that voice in your head saying, " i told it to shut up, and i listened to you.  do i have a little voice in my head.  everybody does. it's called your conscience.  when you do something you know is wrong, your conscience reminds you over and over and over, until you do something about it.  it sounds like a pain in the neck.  i'm really sorry i got you guys grounded.  thanks for backing me up.  tell you what, steph.  i'm going to help you with this book report.  after that, michelle, you and i will play candyland.  i promise to spend more time with both you guys.  give me a hug.  hey, you guys can hang out in my room any time you want.  whoa, d.j.,don't get carried away.  here, let's start.  it's chapter 12.  o.k., right there.  . whatever happenedto
