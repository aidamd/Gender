were right.  what happened. how was their first day.  just like themshort.  they got there, honey, and, quite frankly, they just weren't ready.  oh, i was afraid that this would happen.  well, hey, we gave it a shot.  honey, they'll fall way behind the other kids.  in what, playdoh comprehension.  listen, i got this whole thing figured out.  joey and i don't do the radio show until late afternoon.  i'll teach the kids right here at home.  jess, you are not exactly mister rogers.  you teach the kid a couple vowels, then you teach him all the, uh, letters that aren't vowels, you put a puppet on and it's fine.  don't you think the kids should interact with other kids on their level.  that's where joey comes in.  what a dump.  didn't dad tell you to clean up.  yes, he did.  but he'll have to understand i'm old enough to keep it the way i want.  you're going to have to understand you can't watch tv for the rest of your life.  oh, little michelle, this might be over your head.  when you're older, you'll understand.  and when you're older, you still won't.  let me handle this.  all our lives we've lived under dad's rules.  what can we show for it.  a nice house, good food, a buck a week.  don't rock the boat.  michelle.  howdy, roomie.  that's a funny thing for someone to say before they leave.  steph is a total slob, so i'm moving in with you, the good sister.  oh, stephanie's not bad.  she's just becoming a teenager.  it's a rough time. i went through it.  you're going to go through it.  the best place to go through it is in your own room.  can't i go through it in your room.  michelle, i love you, so i'm not gonna kick you out.  dad.  does dad have to get involved in this.  michelle, you're not moving in here.  yes, i am.  you have to go back.  whoever was wrong last time, you're right.  let's have dinner.  you're always taking her side.  dad, michelle thinks that just because stephanie has turned into miss pigpen, she can move in with me.  i distinctly told her to clean it up.  maybe you need to tell her more distincter.  dad, just go in and yell at her.  lay down the law. it worked with me.  over the years, i have come a long way as a dad.  i have learned there are other techniques besides yelling.  sometimes subtle psychology can go a long way.  what's subtle psychology.   look at this room.  you call this clean.  not that.  it's like your closet threw up.  but, dadif this room isn't up to tanner standards, you're grounded for two weeks.  bigfoot will be seen around here more than you.  is that clear.  loud and clear.  d.j., i don't want you to see kimmy anymore.  what.  i was on a roll.  dad, what happened to subtle psychology.  see, that was subtle psychology.  you don't want to see me when i get mad.  all right, kids.  the katsopolis

beck, you're home.  uhhuh.  how's school going.  terrific. good. really good.  we were just doing a little art appreciation.  i think you'll appreciate it.  beck, iiit's not how it looks.  oh, so the boys weren't painting your feet while you two fine educators were out cold.  it is how it looks, isn't it.  if they paint up to the ankle line, i can save big bucks on socks.  out.  class dismissed.  beck, this whole thing was a disaster.  i'm not qualified to teach preschool.  joey's barely qualified to attend.  aw, honey, it's too bad the boys didn't like preschool.  well.  we like preschool.  really.  miss suzie is nice.  jess, it sounds to me like they like preschool.  well, sure, yes. they say so now.  but you should've seen their little faces in the corner of that classroom.  were they crying.  well, they weren't crying in a waterworks way crying.  it was more of a dry cry, really.  ah. were they angry.  well, no. they weren't angry per se.  what were they, uh, per se.  ..  they were laughing and playing.  sounds like you got them out just in time.  you weren't the only one to lose it.  i lost it, t i was fine at breakfast, grooving in the car.  then i get to the classroom, i ask for a kiss, i pucker upthey left me midpucker.  aw, honey, they didn't even kiss you goodbye.  no.  it was like they didn't even need me.  all that time we spent rocking them to sleep, feeding them and wiping their little faces ..  wipeable areas.  it's like none of that mattered, you know.  i just wanted to hold on for one more second, and they didn't even turn around.  you know, maybe it's good that they didn't look back.  maybe it means we've given them the confidence to face the world without us.  beck, up until this preschool thing, we were their world.  honey, if we're acting like this now, what're we going to be like when they go to college or get married and have their own kids.  you're right, honey.  well, suddenly this preschool thing doesn't sound so bad.  i know it's hard to let go, but we gotta do it sometime.  i'd hate to walk into college with two freshmen clinging to my legs.  nicky, alex, tomorrow you guys are going back to preschool.  yay. yay.  first we want our kisses, so come here and pucker up and kiss us goodbye.  well, jess, this is itthe moment of truth. can you let go.  i can let go.  jess, let go.  oh. right. yeah.  byebye, boys.  byebye.
