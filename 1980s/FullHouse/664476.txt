might as well go for it.  hiya, bec.  i figured we'd get a bite to eat first.  dinner sounds good, but i've been thinking.  maybe you were right.  of course i was.  what did i say.  that if i didn't want to go to the club, i should skip it.  i didn't mean don't go to the club.  i meant skip the argument.  so you didn't really mean you weren't going riding again.  no, i met that.  oh, really.  yeah. why don't you want to come.  you play the same songs three sets a night, three nights a week.  the smash club's fun.  fun. it's loud, smoky.  the ladies' room is immaculate.  tell her she's wrong about that.  tell him i'm right.  i better stay out of the ladies' room.  can you believe she's not going tonight.  becky, is that true.  yes.  then i believe it.  go wash.  iiuncle jesse, it's me, michelle tanner.  somebody probably wants to hear me sing.  coming, michelle.  why do you men cling to your antiquated macho attitudes.  because we're tough and rugged.  now take a hike so i can separate my washnwears from my delicates.  can i help you.  a kiss, please.  all right. upsidedown kiss.  see, somebody still loves me.  michelle, can i talk to you.  i'm a monkey.  hoo hoo hoo hoo.  can i tell you my problem first.  all right, listen to this.  my toy.  don't grow up and be selfish like becky.  next, you won't want to hear me sing.  i don't know what's gotten into becky lately.  she's really getting on my nerves.  after 7:00 already.  i better check that garbage disposal.   sometimes she gets so stubborn and pigheaded.  excuse me.  sometimes those things pick up other people's houses.  why can't becky realize your uncle jesse's right.  it's so simple. it's so simple.  it's so simpit's so simphi. hi.  oh, you found the baby monitor.  michelle, do that imitation of me again.  we've got to talkalone.  you can say it in front of michelle.  no. that's not true.  see what i'm saying. hold this.  becky.  stubborn. pigheaded.  i only go to that club to be with you.  why are we arguing. let's go.  you won't do what i want to do.  oh, i get it. this is about revenge.  you're punishing me 'cause i won't ride your stupid horses.  those stupid horses are a lot smarter than you.  say i'm right.  ok. i'm right.  funny.  don't you dare walk out.  don't you dare leave this hallway.  don't you dare take that step.  that step. that step.  what do you want to say.  ..  this whole thing's your fault.  well, i disagree, but what else is new.  we always disagree.  we have completely different interests.  maybe we should date other people more like ourselves.  so that's what you want.  it's what you want.  this relationship's over. goodbye, jesse.  fine. goodbye, rebecca.  pepsi, and you could win concert cash.  great idea.  you got it from the jacket.  yeah do you

baby.  i knew those milk and cookies would pay off.  you nerd. i ate the milk and cookies.  you're in trouble this christmas.  the tooth fairy and santa claus ..  jesse, maybe you'd feel better if you called and apologized.  no. we don't have one thing in common.  oh, sure you do.  what's that.  you're both crazy about me.  guess what.  the tooth fairy left me $20.  $20. whoa, baby.  how come the tooth fairy never left me $20.  possibly, the tooth fairy was fumbling around in the dark and accidentally took the wrong bill out of his or her wallet.  well, i certainly hope the allowance fairy makes the same mistake.  all right, get your pancakes here.  mmm. pancakes. all right.  my pancakes.  no, michelle.  honey, those are for everybody.  let's all show michelle how much fun sharing can

to win.  i want you to understand me.  ..  you may have accidentally said something useful.  i did.  instead of arguing with each other, why don't we try really listening to each other.  we might learn something.  that's exactly what i want.  i want us to know each other better.  let's try this with our problem.  you hate the club because it's loud and disgusting.  you don't want to ride horses because they're stupid and potentially dangerous.  we'll give up everything we love and be happy.  wrong.  good, 'cause i just got this new guitar.  jesse, we don't have to give up anything.  we can do our own things and still be a couple.  what if you only go riding because you want to.  and you only go to the club because you want to.  but never because we feel we have to.  i'm still going horseback riding with you because i just really love being with you.  you're so sweet.  there is one good thing about our fighting.  what's that.  we have a great time making up.  yes, because our love's more important ..  jesse.  ..  jesse.  just say, "have mercy" and kiss me.  have mercy.  aww. aww.  i knew they would come in.  i just want to thank you for sticking your noses where they
