shirt.  he broke up with you, not cindy crawford.  we're going to build the car real low to the ground so it cuts down on wind resistance.  is it going to go fast.  let's just say you'd better hang on

i ask dad just in case.  michelle, trust me.  the steering wheel always goes in front of the driver.  if you say so.  hey.  what do you call that piece of junk.  ..  the first place winner.  well you should call a garbage man to haul it away.  oh, yeah.  yeah.  yeah.  yeah.  o.k., fine. michelle, hop in.  let's show him what we got.  ready.  set.  pfft.  what you got is no chance.  bye, girls. ha

you were so excited, you slept in your crash helmet.  honey, if you're upset about the wheel falling offi'm not upset. i just changed my mind.  i'm a kid. it happens.  ..guess i'll replace the pin

oh, right. ha. thanks.  ..  how's it goin'.  it's, uh, it's goin'.  yeah. yeah.  deej, i don't know how you'll feelsteve, it's natural to feel loss and a desperation to hang on, but you should let it go.  why do i have to let it go.  it's my cd. you borrowed it.  your cd.  i was hoping i could get it back.  see, deej.  he's not devastated.  he just wants his cd back.  ..out. now.  right.  gotcha.

miss you.  yeah, i got to admit i miss you, too.  and i feel bad, because every couple that breaks up says, "we're going to stay friends," but they never do.  that doesn't have to happen to us.  we're friends. we can do friendly things.  hey, want to go to the movies.  are you hungry.  d.j., it's me.  what was i thinking.  wait, deej, wait.  how is this any different from dating.  well, we won't make out anymore.  bummer.  i'll pay for my own pizza.  actually, this could work out.   last time i saw joey bend over that far was 'cause an oreo rolled under the couch.  o.k. i think we're ready for the barre exercises.  i'm ready for the barf bag.  shh.  somebody's been practicing.  thank you for noticing.  steph, i just imagine myself a squirrel on the first day of spring gathering nuts.  very good, joey.  gather, gather.  swish your bushy little tail.  oh, nice nut work.  i think that's one squirrel that should have stayed in his tree.  au contraire.  i think he made a radiant rodent.   do do do do ba ba da dum .   da .  ballet to help his hockey.  pretty soon he'll be taking up knitting to help his football.  michelle, what are you doing here.  it's my room.  why aren't you

 who told you that.  kenny.  ..  he's a bonehead.  you said it too, daddy.  i did.  you said girls don't even know where the steering wheel goes.  sweetheart, that was just a joke.  danny, you've got
