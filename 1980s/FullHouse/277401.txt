like a jerk, but there's good in everybody.  beck, remember that guy we interviewed a few weeks agotommy bun.  oh, yeah.  what a jerk.  he charged over $1 million on other people's credit cards but later he showed a different side of himself.  yeah. he mooned us.  before telling us that other stuff, he told us how he used to carpool.  of course, it was a stolen car.  and he was fleeing the country.  i wish he'd taken charles with him.  be nice to him.  maybe it'll rub off on him.   battle stations.  hello, charles. nice to see you.  yeah. i wish i felt the same.  everybody, this is charles.  hi.  i see where you get your looks.  well, thanks.  i didn't say goodlooks.  could we just do the assignment.  i can hardly wait.  maybe there isn't good in everybody.  somebody needs to
