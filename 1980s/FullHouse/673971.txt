concerns about the unusual.  does unusual mean gross.  o.k.  you know how you two have been asking for advances in your allowances.  well, how does $2.00 sound.  not as good as 5.  steph, a piece of pizza.  uh, sure.  um, what's that crumbly white stuff.  oh, that's goat cheese.  what part of the goat is the cheese.  is it supposed to smell like that.  not that that's a bad smell.  the cheese is just a little ripe.  the spaghetti's not. it's still green.  no, honey, that's pesto sauce.  it's supposed to be green.  yeah, green, like a $5.00 bill.  looks great.  green's my favorite color.  good.  nicky and alex are certainly enjoying it.  it's actually getting into their mouths.    alex, put down that bowl.  i'll take care of this.  time to lay down the law.  put down the bowl.   you

you do that.  i know how finicky the girls can be, and i didn't want them to hurt your feelings.  i'm sorry.  i should have had more faith in you and your goat cheese.  you should have, but because you did it out of caring, i'm going to forgive you.  oh, thanks.  right after you do the dishes.  excuse me.  some of us are trying to keep our dinner down.  o.k. time for dessert.  vanilla ice cream
