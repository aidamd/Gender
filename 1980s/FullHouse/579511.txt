byebye.  stay cool. take us home.  take yourself home.  ok, we have a family meeting for a family problem.  who will review the rules.  me, me, me.  stephanie.  this is the talking stick.  only the person that holds it can talk, ok.  while i have your attention, christmas will be coming soon.  i'm getting bigger.  my bike is getting smaller.  thank you, stephanie.  now, who would like to start.  i'll start.  joey had no right to try to ground me when i have a karate tournament.  tell joey he can't do that.  when i'm not here, i turn over responsibility for you three girls to jesse and joey.  that punishment is too unfair.  cheating. no stick.  shh.  that wasn't talking, that was explaining.  the reason it's hard for you is because it's the first time joey's put his foot down.  i side with joseph 100%.  you do the crime, you do the time.  you pay the piper. you face the music.  i watch too many old movies.  everyone's against me.  dad, do something.  joey's decision is final.  how can you do this.  you should have called.  that's exactly right.  that's not fair. that's not fair.  stop it.  i hate to see everyone fighting.  just sit down and listen to me.  you told me if i put my foot down, i'd be respected.  now d.j. hates me and my foot.  d.j. came in late without calling.  why blame yourself.  this started when i tried to be mr. discipline.  that's not me.  the best part about being in this family is the love and great times we have together.  my family was always fighting.  i don't want to face that again.  there's no such thing as a family that doesn't fight.  even herman munster yelled at eddie occasionally.  look, joey.  the love, the fun, the responsibility, the disciplinethey all go together.  when you're in this family, you're in all the way.  you did the right thing.  d.j. deserved to be punished.  .  ok, i give up.  i won't go to my karate tournament.  but if you're waiting for me to be happy about it, it won't happen.  i'll talk to her.  no. i'll talk to her.  i have the names of everyone who talked without the stick.  uncle jesse, me, daddyaah. no.  i'm worried about what's happening to us.  we've always been great buddies.  yeah, i guess.  d.j., you know we have.  i've known you your whole life.  i was at the hospital when you were born.  when i first saw you, talk about crying.  you were fine. i was sobbing hysterically.  i did you a favor then.  do you remember.  i was a day old.  your parents wanted to name you farrah.  farrah.  " that was close.  i better do my homework.  d.j., we've always been great buddies.  i thought living together would bring us even closer.  now that i'm like a parent, it kind of changes things.  yeah. i never pictured you punishing me.  yeah, me, either.  ..  last night when i didn't know where you were, i was scared to death.  ..  i'm sorry about those mean things i said.  i was just mad.  that's good, because i love you so much.  i love you, too, joey.  if it weren't for you, i'd be farrah jo tanner.  eew. eew.  you know what i'm thinking.  i'm kind of new at this discipline thing.  i know you should be grounded, but maybe grounding you for this weekend was a little unfair.  i can go to my tournament.  what the heck.  thank you. thank you.  you'll make a great dad.  because you got your way.  no, because you were fair.  thanks. remember, next weekend, you're grounded.  that's fine, that's great, that's perfect.  wait. i just remembered.  kimmy and i had plans to go horseback riding.  you know i had to try.  ok, just karate.  hyah.  hyah.  ho.  hyah, hyah, hyung,hyungah.  ok, i'm convinced.  layaway.  tvs. no money down.  clothes. no money down.  toys. no money down.  no money down layaway.  kmart.  where members always get more.  the couch.  you think it smells fine, but your guest smell this.  eliminate odors you've gone nose blind to with febreze fabric refresher.  smells good.  so you and yourrrrguest can breath happy.  are definitely not routine.  and that can takea lot of energy.  nature valleybreakfast biscuits.  four biscuits, 26 gramsof whole @ that give you the energyto help keep you going.  i love nature valleybreakfast biscuits.  do you love frozen fruit smoothies.  uhm.  now you can make them without a blender.  with fruit smoothie shakers from dole.  just shake it up.  add juice.  shake it again.  out comes adelicious frozen fruit smoothie.  mmm, that's so good.  and try new dole power shakers.  people ask me why i swim.  it's not for ribbons or medals.  i'm after something muchgreater...  they call it "the rock." anncr: hormel rev wraps. 15grams of protien.  for those who are hungry.     basic enough.  you need healing.  the only lotion with healing microdroplets of vaseline jelly, new vaseline intensive care relieves very dry skin from the first application and deeply moisturizes toheal it in just 5 days.  clinically proven.  skin healed in just 5 days.  that's the healing power of vaseline.  stain, let's compare an entiretub of oxiclean to just half a cup ofclorox bleach.  okay...  huh...  how is that called clean.  clorox.  eliminates stains betterthan oxiclean.   hi there.   i'm flo. i know.  i'm going to get youyour rental car.  this is so ridiculous.  we're going to manageyour entire repair process from paperwork to pickup, okay,little tiny baby.  your car is ready,and your repairs are guaranteedfor as )
