thanks.  ..  he really streamlined that dad talk.  yeah. we got off pretty easy.   look at the mess in here.  maybe not.  look how low we've sunk to get privacy, sitting in this grungy truck.  we could be in my grungy apartment.  you know, i've never noticed that before.  what.  the way your nostrils flare when you get angry.  it's kind of sexy.  really.  i am at peace.  and i am soaring, ..  man, what a mess up there, jess.  is there anything worse than ground leaves in a carpet.  yep.  my kitchen.  joey, do something.  you catch it.  not your shirt. get a bowl.  a bowl, right.  oh, no.  here, i got a bowl.  no, no, no. not that bowl.  that's my fine china.  ..  ohh.  no. not that bowl.  my mother gave me that.  oh, jesse.  how about this drawer.  do have any emotional attachment to the drawer.  ..  i'm going down.  ..  this, uh, this broom is not working.  turn off the truck.  why didn't i think of that.  when your adrenaline's running, ..  ..  i'll turn off the truck.  that's what i'll do.  joey.  sniff the minty woodlands.  there.  now, aren't we calm and placid.   it's open.  i know i've been saying this a lot, but i'm sorry.  i know you are, deej.  and i'll pay you back for that mess.  oh, i know you will.  we'll work out something, but right now there's something else that we have to work out first.  what did i do now.  well, actually, it's something that i did.  i don't know if you've noticed, but i was following you around with the vacuum cleaner.  i thought that was you.  yeah.  well, ..  i didn't really respect your privacy.  in a way, i forced you and steve into that truck.  what i really wanted to do was talk about what i was feeling at steve's apartment.  dad, i knew what you were feeling.  steve's whole building knew what you were feeling.  maybe i overreacted just a tad, huh.  i tried to explain it, but you wouldn't listen.  you were treating me like a little kid.  i know, i know.  i'm really sorry, deej.  i kept thinking about cathy santoni, a girl your ag. having babies.  then i saw you two on the couch.  you saw us.  well, briefly, until the chair gave out.  ..  nothing happened.  i know.  everything's just getting so complicated.  you're a young woman, you're in a relationship with a boy with his own apartment.  ..  if your mom were around, things would be easier.  dad, you're doing fine.  you don't have to worry.  i'm not cathy santoni.  there are so many things i want to do and see before i get married and have a family.  this is so nice to hear.  we should talk more often.  anytime, dad.  i love you.  i love you, too.  ..  ..  it's o.k. you can go. i trust you.  just be back by curfew.  ..  b ..  you owe steve's landlord $30 for that broken chair.  what.  that piece of junk.  it was old, defectiveit nearly killed me.  he's luckyi don't sue him.
