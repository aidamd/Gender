hallelujah.  well, honey, there is one teeny, tiny, minuscule, trivial decision you've been putting off since we got engaged.  who's going to be your best mandanny or joey.  i know i've been avoiding this.  when we're all together, i'll pick the best man.  great.  danny, joey, come here.  don't embarrass me like this.  i don'thi, boys.  what's going on.  well, uh, now that we're all together, there's something very important i want to talk about.  we're going with the white gloves.  we're happy for you both.  actually, we've planned out the whole wedding except for one little detail.  uh, i have to pick a best man.  i don't want to hurt anybody's feelings.  jess, it's no big deal.  nobody's feelings will be hurt.  whatever you guys decide is fine.  we're mature adults.  all right.  i pick joey.  yes, i get to be the best man. yes.  if that's what you want, it's cool with me.  congratulations, joey.  danny, i'd like you to be my head usher.  oh, hey, that's terrific.  if for any reason, joey is unable to perform his duties as best man or he disgraces his position, the head usher assumes the crown.  ah, see.  well, if needed, i'm ready to serve.  thanks for taking this so good.  i could still win the swimsuit competition.   hang down your head, tom dooley    hang down your head and cry    hang down your head, tom dooley   ..   x ..   danny.  this little hanging tune wouldn't have anything to do with joey being best man.  jess, not at all.  when you think about best man or head usher, there's not much difference.  best man stands next to the groom, holds the ring, makes the toast.  the star of the wedding.  and the head usher, he says, " you trying to make me feel bad.  i would never do that.   swing low, sweet chariot   i'm sorry. those seats are for the
