" ai don't talk like that.  twoi thought she was going to the candy store.  unless that donkey has a creamy chocolate center, you can't blame me for this.  we were on our way to the candy store when we passed this petting zoo.  apparently, you didn't pass it completely.  well, i liked shorty, and the man asked me how much money i had.  i told him i had $221, and guess how much he cost.  let me give him the benefit of the doubt220.  nope. 221.  michelle, look, i'm sorry you got ripped off, but he cannot stay here in this house.  he sheds, he stinks, he's dirty.  you let kimmy in here.  i don't shed.  i'm not arguing about this.  he's got to go back.  you might have a problem there.  it was kind of a traveling petting zoo.  they were packing up to go to seattle.  yeah, and the man said, "you pet it, you " put him in the backyard.  we'll figure out what to do in the morning.  be on your best behavior tonight.  maybe dad will let us keep you.  you'll have to clean up after him.  no problem.  i clean up after my hamster.  i think shorty's going to be a bigger responsibility.   wake up, stephanie. you're snoring.  it's not me.  i thought it was your stomach.   uhoh. it's shorty.  do you think the neighbors can hear him.  whatever that is, i'm going to shoot it.  i'm guessing they can.  i'm sorry. i'm bringing him in.  go back to bed.  put your guns on safety.   wonderful. wipe your hooves on the way in.  maybe tomorrow i'll take you prospecting for gold.  what's wrong with him.  you think he's sick.  i'm not taking his temperature.  if that donkey doesn't let me get some sleep, i'm going to look like a wreck for my senior picture tomorrow.  that goes in my yearbook, my graduation announcements, my college applications.  it's also what they use if you're onhard copy.   shorty, you're not making a very good first impression.  see, i told you it wasn't joey.  it's all right.  i was already up, thanks to some annoying hair rollers.  if they bother you that much, don't sleep in them.  how's anybody going to sleep with this thing in the house.  i'd take him back outside, but apparently it's donkey season.  dad, be nice to shorty.  it's his first night. he's scared.  remember comet's first night.  he slept with a hot water bottle and an alarm clock.  actually, that was my first night.   donkey rides.  me first.  no, guys. the ride is closed.  come on, back to bed.  singthree's company, daddy.  boys, it's almost midnight.  i don't want to. i'll sing it tomorrow.   come on, sing it, jess.  maybe you'll drown out englebert donkeydink over here.  all right, i'll sing it.  but after that, we're all going to bed.   come and knock on our door    we've been waiting for you    we got the thing and the stuff and the thing    three's company, too .  very good. nice ending, boys.  let's say good night. good night, everybody.   when you sang, shorty got quiet with this dreamy look on his face.  maybe it's gas.  i have to get some sleep.  would you just try to sing to him.  you guys are crazy.  you've been inhaling too close to the donkey.  there's no way my singing has anything to do with him not  come on. please sing.  please try.  all right. o.k. fine.  i'm going to do it, mainly because i like the song so much.   come and knock on our door    we've been waiting for you    we got the thing and the stuff and the thing    three's company, too .   well, you heard it, jess.  he's only quiet when you sing.  oh.  you're our only hope for getting through the night.    please keep singing, uncle jesse.  if shorty stays quiet, everyone won't be mad at us.  what am i supposed to do, serenade him all night.   come and knock on our door    we've been waiting for you    we got a thing and some things and some things    and you

sorry, steph. i fell asleep.  shorty must have gone out for a midnight snack.  he ate the entire farm belt.  dad, would you look at this.  shorty ruined my map.  i'm going to fail geography.  i'll write you a note.  what will you say, the donkey ate my homework.  i used that one last week.  ahchoo.  what am i going to do.  i'm all sniffily. my eyes are all puffy.  i can't take my senior picture looking like a blotchy blowfish.  oh, man. maybe it's an allergic reaction.  to what.   i'll give you one guess.  shorty. shorty.  he's in the living room.  get him out. i'm breathing donkey dander.  we got to get that mule out of the house now.  fine. just don't anybody panic.  we don't want to overreact and scare him.  aah.  greatgranddaddy cornwall.  i'm finally starting to see the family resemblance.  shorty, how could you.  that's it. he's out of here.  where are you going.  anybody want to buy a donkey.  nobody wants to buy a donkey.  i did.  anybody want to buy a zebra.  shut up, tanner. i'd rather hear the donkey.  danny, come in here.  the neighbors are armed and cranky.  now i have an idea.  why don't you take shorty to the children's zoo.  yeah, and after that, maybe a movie.  michelle, i'm sure you agree with everybody.  this shorty thing, it's just not working out.  yeah, you're right.  you can eat all day and bray all night.  you'll fit right in.  michelle, i think it's time to say goodbye to shorty.  only question is, whose car are we taking.  with a shave and a hat, we could get him on the bus.  after we sell shorty to the zoo, i'm going to buy candy for everyone and put the rest of the money in the bank.  ..   not you, her.  listen, we're not going to get any money for shorty because we're going to donate him.  so that's it. i'm broke.  i'm afraid so, pal.  that's o.k. at least one good thing happened.  we all got to meet shorty, right, everyone.  so when's that zoo opening.  who cares. we'll wait by the gate.  you know what i think he'd really like before he goes.  i'm not kissing him goodbye.  you know.  all right, but you guys got to help me out.   come and knock on our door    come and knock on our door    we've been waiting for you    we've been waiting for you    where the kisses are hers and hers and his   that's it.   three's company, too .  those are the words.  i knew it.i kind of knew it.  goodbye, shorty.  we're not going to miss you, shorty.  goodbye.  man, there.  well, come on in. sit by the fire.  i'll make you both a drink, and then we can talk.  about what.  antennas up.  so, lorelai, how are you.  um, i'm fine, mom.  rory.  i'm fine, too, grandma.  how areyou,mom.  also fine.  look at that all three of us fine, just like the judds.  so, lorelai, are you dating.  ..  .. no, i'm not...dating.  really. there's no one at all.  no, totally single.  any chance you'll get back with max.  no, mom, there's no chance.  what about the man at the diner who refuses to shave.  he's just a friend, mom.  do you think you'll be single your entire life.  i mean, in terms of your finding someone.  what do you think the odds are.  okay, what is going on.  well, i visited the family mausoleum today.  neverwhat you think it's gonna be.  i just wanted to check on things, make sure they were keeping it up, changing the flowers.  so i went inside and looked around, and it occurred to me that there's a very limited space there.  now, of course, there's a slot open for me and richard and you and rory.  but after the two of you, that's it no more room.  ahh.  so if you actuallydo meet someone someday, i don't know where to put him.  ..maybe we could just dump him at the local pool hall.  don't be silly.  no, this is definitely not a conversation for that.  i looked into expanding into the crypt next door, but the family that owns it wouldn't even discuss it.  i'm getting a little creeped out.  so i talked to the head of the cemetery, and he suggested that we buy an annex.  an annex.  you know like an outlet store.  it would specialize in the irregular family members.  if we do get the annex, and you do eventually, somedayget married mom, just say "fat chance," will you.  we'll have to decide who to move.  ..  why don't we move aunt cecile.  she was always annoying parties.  she loved the "knock, knock" jokes.  mom. you can't just kick out aunt cecile.  " " that's where it ended.  never fully grasped the "knock, knock" concept.  she was a complete idiot.  okay, it's decided cecile goes.  look, putmein the annex.  you are not leaving me alone in there with cecile.  i'm not gonna be held responsible for somebody being kicked out of their eternal resting place.  i'll probably go first, right.  so when rory kicks, throw her in withme.  i'd like my own space, if you don't mind.  why. it'd totally be fun to be there together.  plus, i plan to be buried with all the good cds and my "rock star" belt.  sorry i'm late. what did i miss.  we were just discussing who to move to the annex.  oh. i vote for cecile. horrible woman.  and those terrible jokes.  what'd i tell you.  this is a cold, cold family.   if you're outon the road    feelin' lonelyand so cold    all you have to do is call my name    and i'll be there on the next train    where you lead, i will follow    anywhere that you tell me to    if you need        you need me to be with you    i will follow    oh, oh, oh    where you lead, i will follow    any, anywhere that you tell me to    if you need        you need me to be with you    i will follow where you lead   a3q  causes.  butclearasil daily wash fights 100% of acne.  its science partners with yourskin to help unblock pores, cleanse, and visiblyreduce redness.  so you lookand feelawesome.  clearasil. the scienceof looking awesome.      buy heels, get a handbag half off.   don't stop it, no  buy work, get play half off.  buy one get one half off everything.  during payless bo save now. feel goodpayless.  ahillshire brat.  cause the miller highlife's boiled in say what..  ain't no brat like ahillshire farm brat cause the miller high life'sboiled in.  one more time.  ain't no brat like ahillshire farm brat.  cause the miller high life'sboiled in hillshire. farm.go meat.  one value meal coming right up.  ..less.  get deluxe value at wendy's.  our double junior cheeseburger deluxe or crispy chicken deluxe.  each with fries and a drink, just $2.99.   you know when it's real   good.  yeah. what is it.  no, don't tell us.  every time in my life that i've tasted something greatbut i didn't know what it was, it turned out to be something really disgusting that i never would have tried in the first place.  example.snails.  gross.eat in ignorance and enjoy.  gladly.  so, dad, how's retired lifetreating you.  well, fascinating,actually.  i find myself noticing things everyday things that i must havewitnessed a hundred times before and just walked right past.  like yesterday, your mother moved a vase the one in the hall and she didn't do it in front of me.  no, 'cause nice girls never movevases in front of men.  and she only moved ita little, but as i passed it by, i noticed it had been moved.  and every day'sa new discovery.  your motherchanged her hair or wore shoes that didn't match her purse.  richard. last thursday.  oh, for heaven's sake.  you know what else i noticed.  a first edition flaubert, mint condition, shoved behind several of my churchill biographies.  no.interested.  my life is good.  follow me.  ohh, dad,see if you can find a pair stuffed backbehind your churchills.  what's up, mom.  nothing's up.  you were twitching. i saw you.  you didnot.  mom, you were pulling a fullon tabitha.  i did not pull a tabitha.  is something wrong. no, nothing's wrong.  okay. nothing's wrong.  ..strange lately.  whatis.having him home.  we've never really been home at the same time.  we got married, we went to europe, we came back, he went to work, and it's been that way ever since.  well, so, now it's different.  verydifferent.  he's always here, watching me ..  i don't know.   it's silly.  so he noticed my hair was different.  women die for that sort of thing.  oh, mom,it's just an adjustment.  you guys just need to figure out a new routine. )
