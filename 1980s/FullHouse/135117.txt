vacation.  i thought we'd be together.  i feel terrible, but my professor picked me and five other people out of the class.  she says i have a critical eye.  that's because whenever she shows a film, " you're not laughing. all right. i'll stay.  no. go. it's a good opportunity for you.  thanks, deej. you're the best.  what is going on here.  why is everyone so tired.  i'd ask nicky and alex, but i

hey, you guys won't believe this.  i was driving to the health club.  00 in the morning.  ..8:00. look.  ha ha ha ha.  april fools.  morning breath.  it isn't even april yet.  i know, but every year when i try and catch you guys with an april fools joke, you expect it.  this, however, was brilliant.  you were totally surprised.  i changed every watch and clock in the house.  i knew it was too early.  when i woke up, i didn't even need to go to the bathroom.  i think i speak for everyone in the house when i say, pack your bags.  get out.  yeah. yeah, joey.  come on. it was a joke.  isn't anybody a good sport.  forget it. you're going down, gladstone.  this was absolutely ridiculous.  look on the bright side.  we get a little extra sleep.  top o' the day to ya. ha ha.  i'll get the

of life.  steve and i used to be like that.  we never wanted to be apart.  it's normal for a relationship to go through stages.  the first stage is always hot because it's new.  and when it's not so new.  come on. it's going to be a great party.  i can't. steve's going to call from l.a.  besides, i'd feel weird by myself.  you'll be with us.  you'll be making out all night.  at least come with us tomorrow.  we're going to climb eagle mountain.  thanks, but i'm more of a mall dweller.  suit yourself.  let's get to the party before all the good couches are taken.  hey, deej.  hey.  hey, deej, since you're babysitting tonight, we have got an important job for you.  we've figured out a trick to play on joey.  it's operation payback.  great. how does it work.  you know how every week joey buys lottery tickets and thinks he's going to make the big score.  we're going to make him think that's kind of cruel. )
