  they're the really useful crew    all with different roles to play    round tidmouth sheds or far away    down the hills and round the bends    thomas and his friends    the island of sodor is surrounded by beautiful blue sea.  it has fields of green and sandy yellow beaches.  there are rivers, streams, and lots of trees, where the birds sing.  there are windmills and a coal mine and docks where visitors to the island arrive.  the island also has lots and lots of railway lines.  who's that puffing down the track.   it's thomas.  hello, thomas.   hello, everybody.  welcome to the island of sodor.      today the island of sodor, emily makes an important trip to sodor airport.  and we meet two of thomas' favorite friends.  but first, thomas has a present to deliver at the wharf.    thomas puffs proudly all over the island of sodor.   he's especially happy to visit his friends on the narrow gauge railway.  there is always something special to do or to see in the high hills.  one day, thomas puffed into the wharf.  lots of his friends were there.   hello.   it was the narrow gauge controller's birthday.  the little engines had a lot to do before they could go to his party.  thomas was excited.   i've brought a present from sir topham hatt.  it's a special tent to have the birthday party in.  we have special presents too.  i'm taking decorations.  and i'm taking flowers.  we're taking banners.  and balloons.   they were all very excited.  i'm going to tell him aman in the hillsstory.  they are his favorites.   thomas had never heard of theman in the hills.  he was a very tall man, dressed all in white.  he lived high in the hills.  no one has ever found him.   an idea flew into thomas' funnel.   maybe i can find him and bring him to mr. percival's party.  that would be the most special present of all.  i can help you.  i know the hills better than anyone.  no, thank you.  i'm sure i can find him on my own.   thomas was uncoupled from his flat bed.  please don't leave for the party without me.   and he chuffed quickly away.  thomas raced through the hills.  "the man in the hills, "the man in the hills.  "i know i'll find him.  i'm sure that i will," he chuffed to himself.  thomas puffed up to a hillside halt.  there was a man dressed all in white.  "it's the man in the hills," he thought excitedly to himself.   please, come with me to see mr. percival.  yes, thomas, right away.   so the man climbed on board.  and thomas chuffed away.  thomas puffed proudly into the wharf.   i found the man in the hills.   the man stepped from the cab.  i'm not the man in the hills.  i'm the dairy man.   thomas was surprised.   fizzling fireboxes.   skarloey and rheneas giggled.  we can help you find the man in the hills.  no, thank you.   and thomas steamed quickly away.  thomas searched high and low.  "the man in the hills, "the man in the hills.  "i know that i'll find him.  i'm sure that i will," he huffed to himself.  thomhuffed towards the mill.  a man was waiting nearby.  he was white from head to foot.  "this must be the man in the hills," thought thomas.  please come with me to see mr. percival.  right away, thomas.   so the man climbed on board.  and thomas chuffed away.  thomas puffed into the wharf.  i found the man in the hills.   the man stepped down.   i'm not the man in the hills.  i'm the miller.   thomas could see the miller was no longer white.  all the flour had blown off him.  thomas was upset.  the miller was worried.  i still have to make the birthday cake for the party.  and i have to make the ice cream.   the little engines were cross.  you said you'd bring the best present of all.  percival doesn't have any presents, and we're all late.   thomas felt terrible.   i wanted to find the most special present n.  but all i've done is spoil the party for everyone, especially for mr. percival.   so thomas asked skarloey and rheneas to take the party tent.  please, hurry.   the dairy man and the miller boarded thomas.  and thomas raced quickly away.  thomas was determined to put everything right.  thomas delivered the dairy man to the dairy to make the ice cream.  and he delivered the miller to the mill.  at last, the cake was baked, and thomas chuffed quickly away with it.  thomas met freddie at a junction.  freddie was on his way to the party.  i have to get the birthday cake to the party as quickly as i can.  please, help me find a shortcut.   freddie was happy to help.   come on, now, follow me.   and together, they puffed quickly away.  thomas and freddie stopped at the green hills junction.  suddenly, thomas gasped.   bust my boiler.  look.   there, all in white, was a man.  he was carved into the hillside.  he shown in the moonlight.  it's the man in the hills.  thomas, you've found him.   suddenly, thomas had an idea.   freddie, please bring percival here with all the engines.   and freddie raced away.  soon, all the engines were gathered by the man in the hills.  the engines gasped.  and everyone was delighted.  there, far away and high up in the high hills, sir handel was ready to tell his story.  percival had the best birthday present ever from all of the engines.   here are some dots.  if we join the dots, we will see one of the engines on sir topham hatt's railway.  i wonder which engine it is.  let's join the dots and fi out.  here we go.  there's a tender at the back.  and there's the cab and the dome, the funnel.  can you tell who it is yet.  this engine's got one, two, three, four wheels and one wheel arch just in front of the cab.  do you know who it is.  it's edward.  hello, edward.    sometimes when thomas is thinking, he puffs out a cloud of steam.  look carefully at the shape thomas makes with his steam.  thomas is thinking about one of his friends.  whose shape is that.  this friend has a long tail at the back.  and what are these on top.  they're rotor blades.  thomas is thinking about harold the helicopter.  now thomas is thinking again.  what shape is his steam making this time.  thomas is thinking about a person.  whose shape is that.  they've got a round body, and they're wearing a kind of hat.  who wears a top hat.  sir topham hatt.  thomas is thinking about sir topham hatt.  thomas is thinking again.  what shape will his steam make this time.  thomas is thinking about a place.  what place is this shape.  it has a curved roof and lots of arches.  of course.  thomas is thinking about his favorite place, home.  it's tidmouth sheds.  well done, thomas.   the island of sodor is home to lots of thomas' friends, friends on the rails, friends on the roads, and even some friends in the air.  they are all very different and each very special.  and they are all thomas' friends.  thomas has two friends who don't run on the rails: jeremy the plane and harold the helicopter.  harold is a friend to all the engines on sodor.  thomas always looks forward to seeing harold.  one day, all the engines were busy talking about a surprise for thomas.  thomas puffed in.  he was happy to see his friends.  but his friend wouldn't talk to him.  harold flew away, and toby chuffed off quickly.  thomas was puzzled.  when thomas arrived at tidmouth, he was even more puzzled.  there was harold again.  this time, he was talking to all the engines.  and still, no one would tell thomas what they were talking about.  thomas felt very left out.  so he huffed away.  thomas hid in a lonely siding.  then he heard a friendly whir and whoosh.  harold had come to find thomas.  harold told thomas there was to be a wonderful surprise for him.  none of the engines could tell him about it because then it wouldn't be a surprise anymore.  that made thomas feel very happy.  harold told thomas to puff quickly away.  the children were waiting for him.  later, thomas puffed into wellsworth, and there was his surprise, a wonderful, sparkling christmas tree, a thankyou from his friends for all his hard work.  thomas was very pleased harold had come to find him.  thomas wasn't so pleased the first time he met jeremy the plane.  it was the day of the sodor summer picnic.  thomas was excited.  he had come to collect children from the airport and take them to the picnic.  then thomas met jeremy.  jeremy boasted that, from the air, he could see everything for miles around.  thomas could only see ahead of him on the track.  that made thomas feel he wasn't really useful.  but later that day, thomas and jeremy were both really useful.  jeremy had seen, high up in the sky, that a bad summer storm was coming.  he told thomas that the children's picnic would be ruined.  jeremy couldn't land near the pnic to warn sir topham hatt.  but thomas knew what to do.  he would steam back to the children as fast as he could.  he arrived at the picnic just in time.  the children climbed on board, and no one got wet.  now thomas always looks out for his friends in the air.  he knows they can see things he can't and that sometimes they can travel faster.  but wherever they are and whatever they're doing, they always help each other, because that's what good friends do.   thomas has three different toys to deliver.  and there are three different groups of children waiting for them.  there is a freight car with a scooter, a freight car with a teetertotter, and a freight car with a ball and goalposts.  first, thomas is going to take a toy to the platform with one child.  which toy should he take.  the ball and the goalposts.  no.  you can't play that game on your own.  what about the teetertotter.  no, you need two for a teetertotter.  what about the scooter.  is that good for one child.  let's see.  yes.  the scooter is just right for one child.  now thomas is going to take a toy to the platform with a group of children.  which one should he take.  the teetertotter.  a teetertotter's fun for two children but not for a group of children.  what about the ball and goalposts.  yes, there are enough children to make two teams.  just right for a game with a ball and two goals.  now thomas has one more toy to deliver and two children left to take it to.  is a teetertotter fun for two children.  yes.  the teetertotter is lots of fun for two children.  thomas has delivered all the toys.  and all the children are happy.  well done, thomas.    it was autumn on the island of sodor.  there had been a terrible storm.  lots of tracks were blocked.  and lots of engines had broken down.   but emily made it to brendham docks with her load.  well done.  you're the only engine to arrive on time.  you are excellent, emily.   that made emily very proud.  "excellent emily," she thought.  " sir topham hatt had a very important  jeremy cannot land at the airport, and my mother is on board.  the storm has blown some metal tanks across the runway.  you must collect trevor from farmer mccoll's.  take him to the airport so that he can clear the runway.  then jeremy can land.   oh, yes, sir.  excellent emily can do it.   then murdoch puffed alongside emily.  i'm going to farmer mccoll's too.  lots of lines are flooded.  take the wellsworth track.  i'm not going on that track.  it's much quicker to go through the forest.  i'm excellent emily.  i can make it through.  so emily puffed through the forest.  but soon, she was up to her axles in water.  "nothing will stop me.  excellent emily " so she puffed on through the water.  it was hard work.  at last, emily chuffed out of the flood.  but now she was late.  thomas was waiting at the junction.  there's a fallen tree.  it's blocking the tracks.  harvey's coming to clear it.  i'm excellent emily.  i don't need harvey to clear the tracks for me.   and she puffed proudly away.  emily chuffed up to the fallen tree.  "i'll easily push this out of my way," she huffed to herself.  emily pushed as hard as she could.  but the tree didn't roll out of the way.  it stayed in front of emily.  now emily had to push the tree up a hill.  it was very hard work.  and emily was getting later and later.  at last, emily came to the top of the hill.  the tree rolled away.  and emily raced down the other side.  emily met duck at a junction.  trevor's waiting for you.  don't worry.  i'll be there soon.  some of the tracks ahead are very muddy.  if you get stuck in the mud, it's going to take even longer.  i'm excellent emily.  and i know which tracks to choose.   duck was worried.  emily raced through the villages.  she rattled through the valleys.  "i'm nearly there," emily thought.  emily steamed around the final bend and straight into a big puddle of mud.  "i'll puff through this," thought emily.  then there was trouble.  the track started to sink.  emily was stuck.  she didn't feel like excellent emily anymore.   oh, no, now i'll never get trevor to the airport.   further up the track, emily saw murdoch.  "murdoch's already there," she huffed to herself.  "i should've listened to murdoch.  i should've taken " now she needed murdoch's help.  emily blew her whistle as loud as she could.  murdoch puffed over.  i'm very sorry, murdoch.  you were right.  please, will you pull me out of the mud.  of course, emily.   soon murdoch was chained up to emily.  with a huff and a chuff, he pulled her out of the mud.  thank you so much, murdoch.   emily puffed up to farmer mccoll's.  trevor was waiting.  i must take you to the airport right away, trevor.   emily pumped her pistons.  then she stopped.  "i know what i have to do," emily thought.   murdoch, which tracks would you take to the airport.  the tracks on gordon's hill are still being cleared.  you should take the valley route instead.  thank you, murdoch.   and she puffed away.  emily puffed happily along the valley track.  "murdoch was right," she thought.  then emily saw a telegraph pole across the track in front of her.  emily was going to push it out of the way.  then she remembered what thomas had said.  "i'd better wait for harvey," she huffed to herself.  soon harvey cleared the track.  and emily was on her way again.  emily pulled up at a junction.  ahead, she saw a shortcut to the airport.  that track is muddy.   emily remembered what duck had said about muddy tracks.  "i don't want to get "i'll take " soon emily arrived at the airport.  ..  just in time.  jeremy landed smoothly and safely.  sir topham hatt was delighted to see his mother.  well done, excellent emily.  you made it in time.  oh, that's because everyone helped me, sir.  all of your engines are excellent engines.               captioning bycaptionmax www.captionmax.com [)   doink.   pbs kids. )
