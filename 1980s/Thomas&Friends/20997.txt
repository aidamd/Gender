"dear christopher, "here is your friend thomas the tank engine.  "he wanted to come out of his station yard and see the world.  "these stories tell you how he did it.  "i hope you will like them, "because you helped me to make them.  "    they're two, they're four, they're six, they're eight    shunting trucks and hauling freight    red and green and brown and blue    they're the really useful crew    all with different roles to play    round tidmouth sheds or far away    down the hills and round the bends    thomas and his friends   narrator: the island of sodor is surrounded by beautiful blue sea.  it has fields of green and sandy yellow beaches.  there are rivers, streams, and lots of trees, where the birds sing.  there are windmills and a coal mine and docks where visitors to the island arrive.  the island also has lots and lots of railway lines.  who's that puffing down the track.  it's thomas.  hello, thomas.   hello, everybody.  welcome to the island of sodor.      narrator: today on the island of sodor, cranky tries to show ..  and sir topham hatt acts very strangely.  but first, let's visit the engines at brendham docks.  it was the spring holiday on sodor.  there was to be a party for the children at the duke and duchess' new summer house.  all the engines were very excited and very busy.  thomas chuffed cheerfully into the docks.  james and henry were passing through.  good morning, james.  good morning, henry.  where are you puffing to.  i'm taking these straw bales to the summer house for the children to climb on.  i'm taking wood to make a stage for the children's show and barrels of lemonade to drink.  how wonderful.  i'll see you later at the summer house.   good morning, cranky.  what's good about it.  it's the duke and duchess' party day.  partysmarty.  i don't go to parties.  i'm stuck here loading and unloading all day.  i haven't had a moment to rest my hook.  that load is for me.  it's eggs for the children to paint.  hurry up, cranky.   you're creaky, cranky.  what's the matter.  are the eggs too heavy a load for you.   narrator: cranky didn't like thomas' joke.  he didn't like being called creaky.  no, they're not too heavy for me.  they're light as fluff.   you're not strong enough to pull anything heavier than fluff, tiny thomas.  that's why henry and james have the heavy loads.  narrator: now thomas didn't like cranky joke.  fizzling fireboxes.  i'm as strong as any other engine.  you're not as strong as me.  i can lift much heavier loads than you could ever pull.  narrator: thomas really didn't like that.  we'll see, cranky.  i have lots of time to deliver the eggs.  first, i have to prove cranky wrong.  james has a heavy load.  i'll go and find james.  narrator: so thomas steamed sternly out of the docks.  thomas found james at the junction by the wash down.  hello, james.  i don't have a lot of jobs today.  shall i deliver your heavy load of wood and barrels for you.  you can stay here at the wash down.  then you'll be perfectly polished for the party.  narrator: james thought this was a very good idea.  thank you, thomas.  narrator: so james was uncoupled from the heavy flatbed of wood, and thomas was coupled up.  the flatbed was heavy.  huffing and puffing, thomas set off for the docks.  thomas chuffed back into the docks.  you again.  what are you doing with that wood.  this flatbed is very heavy.  i'm sure you can't lift it.  narrator: cranky looked at the flatbed of wood and barrels.  i'm sure i can.  narrator: cranky's hook swung low over the wood.  thomas watched and waited.   with a creak and a crank and a crank and a creak, cranky raised the flatbed into the air.  thomas' boiler buzzed.  told ya so.  you're still creaky cranky.  and you're still tiny thomas.  narrator: that made thomas very cross.  i will prove cranky wrong and still have time to deliver the eggs.  i'm sure henry had an even heavier load.  i'll go and find henry.  narrator: so thomas steamed stormily away.  thomas found henry waiting by the coal hopper for his special coal.  hello, henry.  i don't have a lot of jobs today.  shall i deliver your heavy load of straw bales for you.  then you can wait here for your special coal.  narrator: henry thought this was a very good idea.  thank you, thomas.  narrator: so henry was uncoupled from the heavy flatbed of straw bales, and thomas was coupled up.  the flatbed was very heavy.   huffing and puffing, thomas set off once more for the docks.  soon, thomas puffed back into the docks.  you again.  now, what are you doing with those straw bales.  this flatbed is very, very heavy.  i'm sure you can't lift this.  narrator: cranky looked at the flatbed of straw bales.  i'm sure i can.  narrator: cranky's hook swung low over the straw.  thomas watched and waited.   with a creak and a crank and a crank and a creak, cranky raised the flatbed of straw into the air.  thomas' funnel fizzed.  told you so.  you're still creaky cranky.  and you're still tiny thomas.  narrator: that made thomas even crosser.  more than ever, thomas wanted to prove creaky cranky wrong.  he had to find the heaviest thing he could.  then an idea flew into his funnel.  lift me, cranky.  narrator: cranky looked at thomas.  he couldn't let thomas win.  cranky's hook swung low over thomas.  thomas hardly dared puff.  with a creak and a crank and a crank and a creak and very, very slowly, cranky raised thomas high into the air.  bubbling boilers.  creaky cranky is lifting me.  narrator: then there was trouble.  cranky creaked louder than ever.  his crane arm stuttered and juttered.  it creaked, and it croaked.  then it cracked.  oh, no.  narrator: cranky's crane arm had broken, and it was all thomas' fault.  thomas was stuck high in the sky and blowing in the breeze.  then sir topham hatt arrived.  thomas, what are you doing up there.  i'm sorry, sir.  i wasyou are causing confusion and delay.  the duke and duchess have no wood, straw bales, or eggs.  now i see you have them all here.  cranky is broken, and you, thomas, think it's a good time to try being a bird.  the duke and duchess are waiting.  narrator: thomas felt very silly.  then sir topham hatt looked at cranky.  and you're as silly as thomas.  narrator: cranky crumpled.  the shame, to be as silly as a steamy.  narrator: soon, a workman had climbed up cranky.  slowly and carefully, thomas was lowered and landed with a jolt and a jutter just as spencer arrived.  dear, oh, dear, thomas.  what a mess.  little engines can get into very big trouble.  narrator: thomas felt even sillier in front of spencer, but he knew now that being strong was only good if you were also really useful, and he had to be really useful.  spencer, i need your help.  you're very strong and can pull much heavier loads than me.  will you take the wood, the straw bales, and the eggs to the summer house for me, please.  it's my fault that cranky is broken.  i must put everything right as quickly as i can.  hmm. very well.  thank you.  i'm sorry, cranky.  i know you're strong, stronger than me.  i'll be back soon with the right parts to fix you.  narrator: then thomas pumped his pistons and puffed out of the docks.  thomas wheeshed like the wind all the way to the steam works.  hello, victor.  cranky creaked, and now he's cracked.  he needs new parts.  you've come to the right place, my friend.  parts aplenty here.  we'll have cranky up and lifting in no time.  narrator: soon, thomas' flatbed was loaded with new parts for cranky.  thank you, victor.  of course, my friend.  give cranky my best.  narrator: and thomas huffed happily away.  thomas puffed into the docks with his heavy flatbed.  cranky was still looking crumpled.  here you are, cranky.  we'll have you fixed in no time.  thank you, thomas.  that's a heavy flatbed.  you know, you're not tiny.  and you're not creaky.  narrator: cranky laughed, and that made thomas laugh too.       go, go, thomas    go, go, thomas    go, go    number one    go, go, thomas    go, go    number one    go, go, thomas       narrator: steam engines are very important.  all day long, they chuff busily up and down the track, taking passengers where they want to go.  let's follow some passengers as they take a journey on this steam railway.  the passengers check the timetable to see when the next train will arrive, and because everyone on the railway has done their job, the engine puffs into the station pulling its train of carriages right on time.   the train stops.  the passengers get on board, and they find a nice place to sit.  if they sit by the window, they have a good view of the world outside as they chuff along.  the train waits until all the passengers have got on board.  the conductor checks that all the doors of the carriages are shut tight, and he signals to the driver that it is safe to chuff out of the station.   the passengers are on their way.  they sit back to enjoy the ride.   what's that.  look.  they've spotted some cows.   the passengers need a ticket to travel on the train.  they can buy a ticket from the conductor.  they give the conductor some money, and he gives them four tickets to their station.  it's not long before the train reaches the station.   everyone must wait for the train to safely stop before leaving their seats.  the passengers step onto the platform and leave the station ready for the fun day ahead.  the passengers are very happy.  they couldn't have got there without the steam train.      all the engines were very excited.   they chuffed cheerfully and chattered as they clattered along the tracks.  today was sir topham hatt's birthday, and there was to be the grandest birthday party on sodor.  thomas had a very special special.  he was to pick up sir topham hatt and lady hatt for the party.  as thomas approached maithwaite station, he gasped.  ahead, he could see sir topham hatt already on the platform.  cinders and ashes.  i must be late.  narrator: thomas pulled into the station.  he was worried.  i'm sorry, sir.  i thought i was early.  narrator: sir topham hatt turned around.  thomas gasped.  sir topham hatt had a moustache.  thomas was so surprised, he nearly popped a piston.  thomas, my good friend.  you're looking perfectly polished today.  thank you, sir.  narrator: sir topham hatt chuckled so loudly, his top hat wobbled.  thomas was puzzled.  sir topham hatt never chuckled so loudly that his top hat wobbled, and sir topham hatt never called thomas his good friend.  i know, thomas.  let's go to the whispering woods.  it's one of my favorite spots.  we have plenty of time before the party.  all aboard.  narrator: now thomas was even more puzzled.  he wanted to ask about sir topham hatt's new moustache and why he was acting so strangely, but thomas didn't want to look silly, so he decided not to ask.  thas pulled away from maithwaite station and chuffed towards the whispering woods.  thomas puffed up to the whispering woods.  edward was there.  edward had brought children to visit the woods.  then he was to take them to the party.  hello, edward.  hello, thomas.  you look worried.  narrator: thomas was worried, but before he could explain, sir topham hatt climbed down.  marvelous.  what fun.  please, sir, we can't stay long.  the children mustn't be late for the party.  oh, partysmarty, thomas.  we have plenty of time.  you worry too much.  narrator: and sir topham hatt strode off.  hello, children.  who'd like a game of hideandseek.  did sir topham hatt say "a game of hideandseek".  yes, he did.  narrator: and thomas' wheels wobbled with worry.  sir topham hatt played hideandseek for a long time.   he was very happy. so were the children.  edward was puzzled.  sir topham hatt never plays hideandseek.  i know.  and what's that on his face.  a moustache.  it just appeared.  today sir topham hatt doesn't seem like sir topham hatt at all.  narrator: just then, sir topham hatt came back.  thomas wanted to ask him if he was feeling all right, but he didn't want to look silly.  thomas knew that silly engines weren't really useful engines, so he didn't ask any questions.  we must hurry now, sir.  we'll be late.  and so will the children.  narrator: but sir topham hatt wasn't worried.  don't hurry the children, edward.  let them play.  edward was so surprised, his boiler bubbled.  then sir topham hatt jumped aboard annie and waved to all the children.  thomas' wheels clicketyclacked.  he puffed and he huffed along the track.  he knew they were late for the party.  thomas stopped at the junction.  suddenly, sir topham hatt jumped out of annie and climbed up to the signal box.  i won't be a moment, thomas.  narrator: thomas was amazed.  so was the signalman.  sir topham hatt never came into his signal box.  hello, there.  may i have a turn.  narrator: thomas looked up.  he saw sir topham hatt pull a lever.  then thomas heard gordon's whistle.   cinders and ashes.  here comes gordon.  narrator: gordon had all the important visitors aboard the express.  he was taking them to the party.  with a clang and a clatter, the points changed.  gordon and the express were no longer on the express track.  they were now on a branch line heading away from the party.  thomas heard sir topham hatt whoop for joy.  hooray.  fizzling fireboxes.  i must ask sir topham hatt why he's being so strange.  narrator: but when sir topham hatt came down from the signal box, thomas didn't say anything.  he still didn't want to look silly.  what fun.  all aboard, thomas.   narrator: thomas raced towards maithwaite.  lady hatt would be waiting.  they were very late.  thomas was worried.  first sir topham hatt had a moustache.  next he wanted to play hideandseek with the children.  then he sent gordon off the express line and away from the party.  hmm.  sir topham hatt is acting very strangely indeed.  narrator: thomas puffed into maithwaite.  the station master was cross.  thomas, you're late.  sir topham and lady hatt had to go to the party in bertie the bus.  but bertie hasn't arrived at the party.  neither have the children or the very important visitors.  narrator: thomas was puzzled.  if sir topham hatt is on bertie, then who's on board annie.  narrator: just then, thomas' passenger stepped down.  thomas knew he had to ask a question he hadn't asked before, even if he looked silly.  excuse me, sir topham.  you don't quite seem yourself today.  is everything all right.  narrator: thomas' passenger beamed brightly.  yes, thomas, but i'm not sir topham hatt.  i'm sir lowham hatt, sir topham's brother.  narrator: thomas was amazed.  that explained everything, but he wished now that he had asked this question earlier.  now there was no time to waste if he wanted to be a really useful engine.  bertie must have broken down.  we must find him right away.  narrator: sir topham hatt's brother was very excited.  hooray.  another game of hideandseek.  narrator: now thomas was stern.  no, sir lowham hatt.  i have to work hard and quickly.  otherwise, your brother's party will be spoiled.  narrator: sir lowham boarded annie, and thomas puffed away.  thomas found bertie the bus.  smoked billowed from his engine.  bertie looked very unhappy, so did sir topham and lady hatt.  thomas, where have you been.  narrator: just then, sir topham hatt's brother stepped down from annie.  sir topham hatt sighed.  oh, no, lowham.  have you been up to your old tricks again.  absolutely right, topham.  i've been having a wonderful time with thomas.  narrator: sir topham hatt didn't think this was funny at all.  lowham, you have caused confusion and delay.  we must hurry.   narrator: thomas delivered sir topham hatt, his brother, and lady hatt to the party just in time.  the party looked grand.  but thomas couldn't stay.  he had work to do.  first, thomas chuffed to the whispering woods.  edward was very happy to see thomas.  go straight to the party with the children, edward.  sir topham hatt is waiting.  it was his brother, sir lowham, who was playing hideandseek.  narrator: next, thomas found gordon.  gordon was huffing and puffing as slowly as a snail down a rickety branch line.  ugh, the indignity.  hurry, gordon, to the next express line.  race like a rocket to the party.  narrator: that made gordon very happy.   at last, thomas chuffed back to the party.  edward and gordon were already there.  what a wonderful party.  narrator: and it was.  everyone was laughing.  then thomas and his friends heard something very extraordinary.  sir topham hatt chuckled even louder than his brother, and that made thomas happiest of all.        narrator: can you guess who this is.  keep guessing.  it's gordon.   captioning bycaptionmax www.captionmax.com
