"diesel's right in front of me," thomas thought sadly.  " thomas puffed towards knapford.  "diesel moved in front of me on purpose," puffed thomas to himself.  thomas felt cross.  he wasn't looking where he was going.  then there was trouble.  there was a cow on the line.  thomas turned quickly into a siding just in time.  he hit the buffers, ..  into the lake.  thomas went to tell the photographer what had happened.  don't worry. i'll take another photograph.  tell all the engines to meet me at tidmouth sheds.   thomas was about to set off.  then he saw diesel.  thomas knew he should tell diesel about the new photograph.  but thomas was worried.  "what if diesel " thought thomas.  so thomas didn't tell diesel.  soon, all the engines except diesel were back at tidmouth.  gordon was cross.  giggles, the famous clown, is coming to the party tonight.  i must collect him from the airport.  i must not be late.  and i have to pick up the brass band from brendham docks.  and i have to collect the bunting and decorations from wellsworth.  oh, okay.  i'll fetch the photographer right away.   thomas was steaming to maron.  then he saw diesel.  diesel was puffing straight to tidmouth.  thomas was worried.  now diesel would find out about the new photograph.  so thomas turned onto a branch line, and he raced back to tidmouth.    there's been a mistake.  you'll all have to come back later.   the engines were very cross.  soon they had all gone, and diesel trundled straight by.  later, thomas had gathered the engines again.  then thomas went to maron to collect the photographer.  just as the photographer was climbing on board, thomas saw diesel.  now diesel would see the photographer, and he would find out about the new photograph.  is boiler and filled the whole station.  the steam has made my camera wet.  i'm sorry, sir.  we'll have to wait for it to dry.  tell the engines to come back later to tidmouth.   so all the engines came back later instead of doing their jobs.  at last the photographer was ready.  no one had noticed diesel wasn't there.  thomas was very relieved.  but just then, diesel oiled round the bend.  diesel was surprised to see all the engines.  he screeched to a halt.  rolls of bunting went everywhere.  no one told me there was another photograph.  but i asked thomas to tell everyone.   all the engines looked at thomas.  thomas felt terrible.  sir topham hatt was very cross.  gordon, you were meant to pick up mr. giggles, the famous clown.  emily, you were meant to pick up the brass band.  and, james, you were meant to pick up the bunting and decorations.  none of you arrived.  so diesel had to do all your jobs, and now he is late to do his own work.   thomas was very upset.  it's all my fault, sir.  i didn't want diesel to know about the new photograph.  in the last one, he moved right in front of me on purpose.  i did not.  the photographer told me to move.  i did.  perhaps you rolled too far.   thomas knew then he'd made a mistake.  i'm sorry, diesel.  i was wrong to think you did it on purpose.  and i'm very sorry for causing all this trouble, sir.   soon all the engines were lined up.  the new photograph was taken.  sir, if i do all diesel's jobs, can he collect the new billboard.  that's a wonderful idea, thomas.   diesel agreed.  it was a wonderful party.  there were clowns and a brass band.  diesel and thomas agreed that the new billboard was the best billboard they'd ever seen.  gordon, edward, and emily all want to do the job.  but only one of their flatbeds is exactly the same size as the telegraph pole.  can you tell which one it is.  let's look at gordon's flatbed.  what about edward's flatbed.  perhaps that is the right size.  's flatbed is too small.  now only emily is left.   the island of sodor is home to lots of thomas' friends: friends on the rails, friends on the roads, and even some friends in the air.  they are all very different and each very special, and they are all thomas' friends.  toby is a very special member of the steam team, because toby is a steam tram.  he is brown and square and made of wood.  thomas is very proud of his friend toby.  he knows that toby is so heavy.  gordon got stuck on gordon's hill.  that made gordon cross.  he needed help to chuff up the hill.  gordon was sure sir topham hatt would send edward, but edward was working at the docks with rocky.  toby was shunting freight cars at wellsworth.  the yard manager told him he had to go and push gordon up the hill.  toby was very worried.  he was sure he wasn't strong enough.  but thomas told toby not to worry.  he knew toby could do it.  so toby puffed up behind gordon.  he told toby a steam tram wouldn't be able to push him.  this made toby very worried.  but he remembered his friend thomas had said he could do it.  he could push grumpy gordon.  he knew he could.  so toby huffed, and he puffed.  he wheezed, and he wheeshed.  and slowly, wheel turn by wheel turn, express up gordon's hill.  thomas was right, and toby was very happy.  thomas one day, thomas saw toby puff out of his shed.  toby was very wet.  he was sure that that would make thomas was very happy.  but he told thomas that birds used to nest in his old roof.  thomas didn't want his friend toby to be so very quickly, he asked the workmen to make a bird house from that made toby happiest of all.  at last, thomas had done something special for his friend toby.  for his smiling, square friend toby.  and toby rings his bell loudest of all when he sees thomas.  ly but a tree has fallen across the line.  emily has to go back.  thomas' whistle is broken.   try another whistle, thomas.  edward is one of the oldest engines on the island of sodor.  edward may not always be the fastest engine, but he is certainly the steadiest.  and for sir topham hatt, a steady engine is a really useful engine.  one morning, edward puffed into the docks.  good morning.   then sir topham hatt arrived.  the brandnew brass water wheel has just arrived from the mainland.  it is magnificent.  it will be displayed by the water works at great waterton.   emily, gordon, and edward were very excited.  they couldn't wait to see the magnificent water wheel.  edward, you will deliver the water wheel to great waterton.   edward beamed from buffer to boiler.  gordon and emily were surprised.  i have chosen you, edward, because you are the steadiest engine.  you are to take the express line.  it is the smoothest and most direct way to great waterton.   gordon gasped.  edward was going to use his express line.  cranky lowered the water wheel onto edward's flatbed.  it had a shiny brass rim that gleamed in the sun.  everyone looked at the magnificent water wheel.  edward the steady is at the ready.   and very slowly, edward pushed his special special out of the docks.  edward puffed up to the junction for the express line.   edward was very happy.  he looked ahead.  if he took the express line, he couldn't stop for the people to admire his magnificent water wheel.  but if he took the other track, he could stop at stations and bridges and sidings.  a lot of people would see his special special.  the signal changed.   edward was having a wonderful time.  ..  ..  and past farms.  everyone cheered and waved.  edward the steady was now edward the magnificent.  edward arrived at the junction.  the track ahead is in need of repair.   but the track ahead led to the school.  edward wanted the school children to see him, so he chuffed on towards the broken track.  the track was very bumpy and jumpy.  the shiny br st at the school, children cheered and waved.  edward wasn't looking at the red signal.   edward applied his brakes but too late.  the shiny brass edge of the water wheel cut even deeper through the ropes.  edward knew now his long journey had made him late.  then he had an idea.  "i will chuff up gordon's hill," edward thought.  "it's the fastest way to great waterton, and," he huffed to himself, "the other engines on the hill " edward chuffed and huffed up gordon's hill.  oliver and arthur passed him coming down.  they both thought his special was magnificent.  but the water wheel was very heavy.  edward huffed and puffed up the hill.  at last, he reached the top.  but the edges with a final jolt, the ropes broke.  fizzling fireboxes.   gordon was further down the hill with flatbeds of scrap iron.  the water wheel rolled down the hill.  it bounced onto gordon's flatbed.  now edward's magnificent water wheel was on its way to the smelters.  edward had to get to the smelter's yard before gordon.  edward puffed and edward panted along every shortcut he knew.  no one saw edward pass.  and no one stopped to wave.  that no longer mattered to edward.  he had to save his magnificent water wheel from the smelters.  gordon puffed slowly into the smelter's yard.  he pulled up outside the smelting shed.  then, suddenly, there was edward.  edward the steady had won his race against the fastest engine on sodor.  the magnificent water wheel was once again tied down to edward's flatbed.  edward the steady once more at the ready.  arrator) and his wheels clicketyclacked without a cheer or a clap along the way.  the water wheel was put into place.  it looks grand.  it looks magnificent.   and edward didn't need anyone to tell him that this had been a very special special.    . .
