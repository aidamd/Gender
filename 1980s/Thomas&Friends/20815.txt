"i still don't know how to tell percy about the brass band," thought thomas.  so he took a different track to the docks.  thomas knew it would take him longer.  "i must hurry. i don't want to be late," he thought to himself.  later, thomas was steaming along.  cinders and ashes, there's percy again.   he was sure percy was going to see him this time, so thomas hid behind duck.  percy puffed past.  he didn't see thomas hiding behind duck's long line of freight cars.  thank you, duck.   duck looked puzzled.  thomas steamed on to the docks as fast as his pistons would pump.  thomas was late for the brass band.  they were waiting on the dockside. )
