[) today on the island of sodor, a puppet show arrives in the high hills.  and we meet one of thomas' favorite friends.  but first the carnival comes to the island of sodor.    rosie is a lively little tank engine.  she's very quick.  she also likes to be very busy.  any job is a good job for rosie.  one day, rosie and emily were at knapford station.  sir topham hatt had some important news.  the carnival train is waiting at brendham docks.   rosie was excited.  she hoped sir topham hatt would ask her to pull the carnival special.  emily, you must pull the carnival special.   rosie was disappointed.  rosie, you must be emily's back engine.   rosie didn't want to be the back engine.  she wanted to pull the carnival special on her own.  i have a lot to do today.  after we pull the carnival special, i have to collect the milk from high farm.   rosie puffed sadly along.  she wished she could pull a special on her own.  then rosie had an idea.  if she arrived at the docks before emily, she could take the carnival special.  then emily could puff straight to hill farm.  that would really help emily.  so rosie raced off as fast as her pistons would pump.  rosie puffed alongside the carnival special.   this is a very long train.   rosie couldn't see that emily was already coupled up and waiting for rosie.  rosie quickly coupled up to the carnival special.  "emily will be pleased," she thought.  still, rosie didn't know that emily was on the other end of the train.  then there was trouble.  rosie huffed and puffed.  she heaved and hauled.  the couplings groaned and strained until one of them snapped.  hooray.  i'm pulling the carnival special.   but rosie had left half of it behind with emily.  rosie puffed proudly along.  the children were very excited to see rosie pulling the carnival special.  that made rosie happy.  then there was trouble.  another coupling snapped.  up ahead, bertie was carrying children to the carnival.  rosie chuffed by.   bertie started to toot his horn.  "he's tooting at my carnival special," thought rosie.  but bertie was tooting because the coconut car was rolling towards the level crossing.  it smashed against the gate.  coconuts rolled everywhere.  the level crossing was blocked.  but rosie didn't know.  she puffed happily on.  then another coupling snapped.  rosie passed stepney in a siding.  stepney was waiting to puff onto the main line.  the points changed.  stepney blew his whistle loudly.  "he's whistling at my carnival special," thought rosie proudly.  oh, my.  but stepney was whistling because the freight car of sugar was now rolling towards him.  stepney was covered in pink sugar from funnel to footplate.  but rosie didn't know.  she puffed proudly on.  rosie steamed up gordon's hill.  then another coupling snapped.  she heard an engine's whistle.  "they're whistling at my carnival special too," rosie thought happily.  but it was emily with the rest of the carnival cars.  rosie's flatbed was now rolling back towards emily.   it smashed into emily.  seats from the big wheel clattered and clanged all over the tracks.  emily was stuck.  rosie chuffed into maithwaite station.  nobody waved or whistled.  sir topham hatt was cross.  i told you to be emily's back engine.  but i brought the carnival special all on my own, sir.  i wanted to help emily.  you haven't helped anyone.  you have caused confusion and delay.  you've left half the train.  now there'll be no carnival for the children.   rosie felt terrible.  she had wanted everyone to be proud of her, and now they were cross.  please, sir.  i know just what to do.  i'm a very quick engine.  i can collect all the cars.  then i will be emily's back engine, and we will deliver the carnival special in time.   so rosie whooshed off as fast as her wheels would whir.  first rosie collected rocky.  then she pulled him as quickly as she could to emily.  emily's tracks were still blocked.  i am so sorry, emily.  i only wanted to help you.  rocky will clear the line.  i will collect the other cars.  then we can deliver the carnival special together.  thank you, rosie.   rosie left rocky, and she raced away to collect the first freight car.  she picked up the coconut car.  then rosie collected a new car of sugar, and she raced back to emily.   rosie had been very quick.  rocky had just loaded the seats back on the flatbed.  i'm ready to be your back engine now.    and together they set off up gordon's hill.  rosie and emily arrived at maithwaite.  all the children waved at the two engines.  we have delivered the carnival special in time.   that evening, rosie and emily watched the children at the carnival.  the children were having a wonderful time.  i hope we can work together on another special.  the sooner, the better.  working with you is the best of all.   rosie couldn't have felt happier.   here are some dots.  if we join the dots, we will see one of our favorite friends on sodor.  can you guess which friend it is.  let's join the dots and find out.  off we go.  first around the buffers.  those look like an engine's buffers.  now the wheels: one, two pairs.  then around the back.  there's no separate coal tender.  do you know which engine this is yet.  there is the dome and the funnel.  this is a small engine.  ..  green.  it's percy.  hello, percy.     . .         the island of sodor is home to lots of thomas' friends: friends on the rails, friends on the roads, and even some friends in the air.  they are all very different and each very special.  and they are all thomas' friends.  thomas knows diesel very well.  thomas knows he can be tricky and very devious.  so when thomas has to work with diesel, he has to watch out.  one halloween night, sir topham hatt told thomas and diesel to collect flour cars from the mill.  diesel was delighted.  now he could play lots of tricks on thomas.  boo.  oh.    when they chuffed past the forest, diesel made spooky noises.   ooh.   when they huffed past an old mine, diesel said he could hear a ghost engine.   and when they stopped by a twisty tree, thomas' firebox fizzed with fright.   diesel was having a wonderful time.  he called thomas a scaredyengine, and thomas didn't like that.  so thomas decided to play a trick on diesel.  thomas rolled out of the flour mill.  he was covered from dome to buffer in white flour.  he looked like a ghost engine.  diesel nearly tipped off the tracks.  now he was the scaredyengine.  thomas tried to tell diesel he was only covered in flour, but diesel had raced away.  so thomas finished the job alone.  he delivered the flour to the bakers all by himself.  diesel was still trembling on the tracks, and that made thomas smile.  diesel wasn't so scary now.  diesel is often cheeky and sometimes tricky.  one day, thomas was working with mavis at the quarry.  diesel was up to his old tricks.  he pushed thomas under the stone hopper and called thomas a stinky steamy, and he told thomas that sir topham hatt was going to scrap him.  thomas was upset.  then there was trouble.  salty had delivered fuel to all the diesels, but the fuel was bad.  it made them sick.  diesel was as green as a leaf.  sir topham hatt told thomas he must collect new fuel from the docks.  thomas wanted to help his friends.  he even wanted to help diesel.  so he raced to the rescue.  he chuffed and he puffed all over the island, delivering new fuel to the diesels.  at last, he huffed to the quarry.  diesel's engine was filled with the new fuel.  he felt as good as new.  he even smiled at thomas.  diesel may be tricky, and he may be devious, but he knows that thomas is a very special engine.  and thomas knows that even diesel can be a very special friend.   thomas has a busy day today.  he has to take three different loads to three different parties.  he has a freight car full of fireworks, a car full of pumpkins, and a car with a big cake and lots of candles.  first thomas has to take something to the children's birthday party.  what about the freight car full of pumpkins.  are pumpkins right for a birthday party.  no, thomas doesn't think pumpkins are right for a birthday party.  what about the big cake with all those candles.  yes, a birthday cake with lots of candles is just right for a birthday party.  next, thomas has to take something to a halloween party.  what about fireworks.  are fireworks right for a halloween party.  no, thomas doesn't think fireworks are right.  what about pumpkins.  yes, pumpkins make jackolanterns.  pumpkins are just right for a halloween party.  last of all, thomas has to take something to the firework party.  there's only one freight car left, and it's full of fireworks.  fireworks are just right for a firework party.  thomas has taken everything to the right party.  well done, thomas.   one bright spring morning at the coal yard, the yard manager was talking to skarloey.  a puppet show is coming.  the children will be excited.  no one in the hills has ever seen a puppet show.   skarloey wanted to pull the puppet show special, so he raced away.  skarloey puffed into the transfer yards.  thomas and the narrow gauge controller were already there.  please, sir, may i pull the puppet show special.  that's a fine idea, skarloey.   skarloey's boiler bubbled with excitement.  watch out.  they're heavy.   skarloey buffered up.  slowly, skarloey puffed away.  the cars were heavy.  but skarloey was happy.  the puppet show special was his.  skarloey heaved and hauled up the steep hill.  at last, he reached the top.  rheneas was there.  he was very excited to see the puppet show special.  those cars look heavy.  i could help you.   skarloey didn't want to share his special with rheneas.   no, thank you.  i can pull these cars on my own, rheneas.  i'm stronger than you.  no, you're not.  oh, yes, i am.   then an idea flew into skarloey's funnel.  we'll put the cars between us and pull our hardest.  the strongest engine will pull the puppet show special.   rheneas was soon coupled up to the back of the train.  they pulled with all their strength and steam.  first the cars trundled one way.  then they trundled the other.  skarloey was determined to win.  then rheneas heard a creaking and a cranking.  he knew the couplings were being pulled too hard.  but skarloey wouldn't give up.  "i must win," he thought.  then there was trouble.  with a crack and a clank, rheneas' coupling snapped.  the puppet show cars bashed and bumped into skarloey and pushed him down the other side of the hill.  skarloey was scared.  he tried to apply his brakes, but they wouldn't work.  the puppet show special rattled and roared.  skarloey flew faster down the steep hill.  skarloey saw duncan.  he was pushing cars of bunting onto the main track.  look out, duncan.  stop.   but it was too late.  skarloey crashed into duncan's cars.  bunting flew into the air.  it fell all over skarloey.  duncan was cross.  oh, sorry, duncan, but i must get the puppet show to the children.   skarloey raced on.  the puppet show special clattered and chattered.  then skarloey saw rusty at a junction ahead.  rusty was pulling cars of special ice cream.  out of my way.  i can't stop.   rusty stopped right across the tracks.  skarloey bashed into rusty's cars.  ice cream flew into the air and spattered all over the engines.  rusty was cross.  now there would be no ice cream at the puppet show.  sorry, rusty, but i must get the puppet show to the children.   so skarloey clattered on.  skarloey was puffing towards percival pond.  then there was trouble.  skarloey went round the bend too fast.  he steamed into a siding.  skarloey bashed through the buffers.  and with a splash, a sploosh, and a splosh, skarloey plunged into percival pond.   fizzling fireboxes.  i wanted to pull the puppet show special on my own.  now look what i've done.  the children won't have ice cream or flags.  they won't have their puppet show.  help.   but there was no one to hear.   then skarloey heard a whistle he knew.  "that's rheneas," he thought.  rheneas puffed to the edge of percival pond.  skarloey had never been happier to see his friend.  i puffed as quickly as i could.   i thought you might need my help.  and i do.  i wanted to show you that i was the strongest, but all i've shown you is that i'm the silliest.   but rheneas was happy to help.  slowly, rheneas heaved and hauled his friend out of the pond.  at last, skarloey was back on the rails.  but his firebox was out, and his coal was wet.  rheneas, you must take the puppet show to the children.  i have other jobs to do.  me.  thank you, skarloey.   and rheneas puffed proudly away with the puppet show special.  skarloey had a lot to do.  he delivered new cars of ice cream to rusty.  then skarloey found duncan.  duncan's cars were now filled with the bunting.  i'm going to be late for the puppet show.  don't worry, duncan.  i'll help you.  we'll steam to the show ground in no time.   duncan and skarloey arrived just in time.  the children were gathered round the puppet show.  welcome, everyone, to the first puppet show in the hills.   the children cheered.  skarloey puffed up to rheneas.  you're my best friend, rheneas.  and there's nothing stronger than friendship.      . . )
