"he wanted to come out of his station yard and see the world.  "these stories tell you how he did it.  "i hope you will like them "because you helped me to make them.  your loving daddy."   . they're two, they're four .  . they're six, they're eight .  . shunting trucks and hauling freight .  . red and green .  . and brown and blue .  . they're the really useful crew .  . all with different roles to play .  . round tidmouth sheds or far away .  . down the hills and round the bends .  . thomas and his friends. .  narrator: the island of sodor is surrounded by beautiful blue sea.  it has fields of green and sandy, yellow beaches.  there are rivers, streams, and lots of trees where the birds sing.  there are windmills and a coal mine and docks where visitors to the island arrive.  the island also has lots and lots of railway lines.  who's that puffing down the track.   it's thomas.  hello, thomas.   hello, everybody.  welcome to the island of sodor.      today, on the island of sodor, we'll see what happens when thomas gets into some trouble.   and we'll share some fun times with the engines of the narrow gauge railway  but first, thomas is given a very special special.   it was a beautiful day on the island of sodor.  thomas was feeling especially happy.  he was on his way to brendam docks to collect a special special.  it was the day of the sodor show.  sir topham hatt's brandnew car was being unloaded.  it was in lady hatt's favorite colorhat blue.  sir topham hatt had chosen thomas to take the car from the docks to the sodor show.  thomas was so proud, he thought his boiler would burst.  rocky was slowly lowering the car onto a flatbed.  "all the engines wanted this job," thomas puffed proudly.  "sir topham hatt chose me to take the brandnew bandstand," huffed gordon.  "and i'm ready to go.  i'll be first at the sodor show." this made thomas cross.  "i'll deliver sir topham hatt's brandnew car to the sodor show before you," thomas whistled.  "ha," snorted gordon.  and he chuffed off grandly.  "hurry up, rocky," puffed thomas.  "i must be careful and you must wait," said rocky.   but thomas didn't want to wait.  at last, the car was on the flatbed.  "hooray," tooted thomas.  thomas pumped his pistons, ready to race.  he didn't want for the dock man to connect the couplings.  he steamed off, pushing sir topham hatt's brandnew, hat blue car.  "wait, thomas." called rocky.  "wait." called the dock men.  but thomas had a race to win and no time to lose.  "i'll show gordon who's the fastest," tooted thomas.   the children cheered as he puffed passed.  "i'm on my way to the sodor show," he chuffed cheerfully.  the fastest way to the sodor show was to puff over gordon's hill.  thomas's axles tingled, and his wheels trembled.  "whee." he gasped.  and then...  "whoa." sir topham hatt's brandnew, hat blue car slid away from thomas and down the other side of the hill.  "oh, no," cried thomas.  and he raced after the runaway car.  percy was waiting at a signal.  arthur puffed slowly into a siding.  he had heavy wagons of fish.   "look out, arthur."  arthur's wheel spun as he raced straight into the buffers.  the fish shot into the air.  "oh, no." cried arthur.  just then, thomas chased through the junction.  "sorry, arthur," he gasped.  "i have to keep up with the runaway car." the runaway brandnew, hat blue car raced on.  thomas puffed harder and harder.  ahead, there were works on the track.  thick mud was everywhere.  rosie had just left the washdown.  suddenly, she saw the runaway car racing towards her.  "oh, no." cried rosie.  rosie was covered in mud.  "sorry, rosie, can't stop," tooted thomas, and he raced off.  the brandnew hat blue car sped towards the junction.  gordon was waiting with the bandstand.  then there was trouble.  "oh, no," cried thomas.  gordon was surprised.  "i told you i'd get to the sodor show first." and he puffed proudly away.  thomas huffed up to the haystack.  "cinders and ashes," he cried.  "i've lost the race, "and now sir topham hatt's brandnew car won't be at the sodor show on time." thomas felt terrible.  "i must go back to the docks for rocky," he puffed.  thomas pumped his pistons.  then he stopped.  "but i'm not strong enough to pull rocky on my own," he wheeshed.  gordon puffed proudly back down the line.  he had won the race and delivered the bandstand.  "gordon," whistled thomas.  "i need your help." gordon could see that thomas was very upset.  "please, gordon, would you go and collect rocky." "it needs a strong engine like you." gordon liked everyone to know he was strong.  he also liked to help his friend thomas.  so, gordon raced to the docks.  gordon collected rocky and steamed back as fast as he could.  thomas was very happy to see gordon chuff up with rocky.  this time thomas waited patiently as rocky lifted sir topham hatt's car out of the haystack.  thomas wanted to thank his friend gordon.  "gordon," he tooted, "would you like to deliver the car." gordon knew that delivering the brand new hat blue car was the most important job on the island.  "thank you, thomas," he smiled to his friend.  this time, there was no race.  the two friends arrived together at the sodor show.   sir topham and lady hatt were very pleased to see their brand new hat blue car.   everyone clapped and cheered, and thomas cheered loudest of all.     all sir topham hatt's engines look different.  can you tell who this is.  this engine has three big pairs of wheels...  six small pairs of wheels and a short, wide funnel.  what else can you see on this engine.  it's the number four.  can you remember which of sir topham hatt's engines is number four.  here's another clue.  this engine is a beautiful, bright blue color.  only one engine has all those wheels, is blue, and wears number four.  do you know who it is.  that's right.  it's gordon.  hello, gordon.     percy is ready to leave the station.  he's bussing his buffers with excitement.  what's percy pulling today.  percy pulls out of the station pulling...  passengers.  percy pulls out of the station pulling passengers and...  pineapples.  now percy pulls out of the station pulling passengers, pineapples and...  a piano.  can you remember what percy is pulling.  percy pulls out of the station pulling passengers, pineapples and... a piano.  i wonder what's next.  percy pulls out of the station pulling passengers, pineapples, a piano and...  presents.  can you still remember all the things percy was pulling.  let's see.  percy pulls out of the station pulling passengers, pineapples, a piano and...  presents.  can you guess where percy is going.  percy is puffing his way to a party.    the island of sodor is a wonderful place.  it's home to lots and lots of engines.  but where is thomas puffing today.  that's right.  the narrow gauge railway.   the narrow gauge engines live and work in the hills of sodor.  they are small engines.  the narrow gauge engines work for mr. percival, the narrow gauge controller.  he tells them if they are to shunt slate...  or pull coal wagons...  or deliver supplies.  they look after each other, especially if one of them is in trouble.   and one day, sir handel was in trouble.  sir handel is one of the oldest narrow gauge engines.  sir handel had a special.  he was to pull wagons of apples very carefully.   but sir handel couldn't puff up the hill.  his pistons popped, his traction rods rattled, and his boiler bubbled and bounced.  peter sam came to sir handel's rescue.  he pushed, and he puffed sir handel up the hill.  then sir handel had another special.   this time, it was wagons of sheep.  again, sir handel couldn't get up the hill.  this time, duncan chuffed to his rescue.  but there was no one to help the time mr. and mrs. percival were on board.  the hill was steep.  sir handel shuttered and jutted and stopped.  the picnic hamper burst open.  sir handel felt terrible.  now he was sure he would be sent to the scrap yards.  but sir handel was wrong.  thomas brought a special engineer.   sir handel was fixed in no time.    all the engines like to help each other.  one day, mr. percival had an important job for duncan and rusty.  but duncan found a hidden track.  he was supposed to be pulling coal trucks with rusty...   ...but he wanted to see where the track went.  rusty was cross.  he told duncan they had to work, but duncan is a narrow gauge engine who likes adventures.  rusty chugged off.  and duncan chuffed off to have an adventure.  he followed the old track into the side of a mountain.   duncan was excited.  then there was trouble.   duncan had biffed into a wooden beam.  the roof fell in, and duncan was trapped in the mine.  but duncan is also a smart engine.  slowly and carefully, he pushed behind some heavy wagons until...  at last, he pushed the wagons out into the open air, and there was rusty.   rusty had been worried about duncan, and duncan was very happy to see rusty.   duncan still likes adventures, but he likes his narrow gauge friends most of all.   the engines of the narrow gauge railway are very special.   thomas always enjoys his visits to see them.  they may be smaller than he is, but they are just as useful.    percy, diesel and james all want to go to the washdown, but emily is blocking their way.   she will have to move before any of them can get there.  who do you think will get to the washdown first.   here comes james, but how will he get emily to move.    he's blowing his whistle at her as loudly as he can.  that's not very kind.  emily doesn't move, so james can't get to the washdown.   now diesel is going to try.  what will he do to get emily to move.  diesel is trying to shunt emily out of the way.  that's not very kind at all.  and it isn't working.  emily has put on her brakes even harder, so diesel can't get to the washdown, either.  here comes percy.  what do you think he will do.   percy isn't whistling or trying to shunt emily out of the way.  he's asking her kindly.  "would you mind moving please, emily."  it's worked.  emily is moving into the siding.  percy will be first to the washdown, and all because he asked kindly.    it was a busy day for the engines on sir topham hatt's railway.  gordon was taking passengers across the island.  he felt magnificent.  henry was delivering logs to the lumberyards.  he was right on time.  percy was pleased to be pulling mail cars.  james was happily hauling flatbeds of paint.  and salty was carefully shunting wagons of fish at brendam docks.  but thomas and emily were at the fitters' yard for repairs.  "i can't wait to get back to work.  i'm taking the school choir to their concert." emily was ready to go.  "goodbye, thomas," she whistled.  "good luck with your final inspection." "thank you, emily," tooted thomas.  then james puffed in to deliver his paint.  "bust my boiler," he laughed.  "you've broken down, thomas." "no, i haven't," huffed thomas.  "you must have done," snorted james.  "otherwise you wouldn't be at the fitters' yard.  "what a shame you're not a smart and useful engine like me." that made thomas cross.  sir topham hatt arrived.  "thomas," boomed sir topham hatt, "are you ready to take the school choir to their concert." "nearly ready, sir," puffed thomas excitedly.  "nearly ready isn't good enough," said sir topham hatt.  thomas didn't want anyone else to collect the school choir.  carrying children was his favorite job.  so thomas decided he would leave before his final inspection.  "i'm ready now, sir," he puffed.  and thomas chuffed away to pick up annie and clarabel.  thomas was puffing up the line.  he began to make strange noises.  annie and clarabel knew something was wrong.  "something's wrongclacketyclong, clacketyclong.  something's wrong." but thomas wasn't listening.   the school choir cheered when they saw thomas.   "all aboard," chuffed thomas cheerfully as he clanketyclonged into knapford station.  "who is making that nasty noise." wheeshed emily.  emily saw it was thomas.  "did you have your final inspection." asked emily.  this made thomas cross.  "i'm fine," he huffed.  and he steamed away with the choir on board.  thomas rattled even more.  "clacketyclong, clacketyclong." later, thomas had to stop at a signal.  he was feeling hot and bothered.  toby saw that something was wrong with thomas.  "did you take on enough water at the fitters' yard." this made thomas even more cross.  "there's nothing wrong with me." just then, the signal changed.  thomas puffed away.  thomas was rattling and steaming more and more.  "clacketyclong, clacketyclong." further up the line, percy was waiting at a crossing.  "what's happened to you, thomas," cried percy.  "you look puffed out." "bother," steamed thomas.  he didn't like being told there was something wrong with him.  "there's nothing wrong with me, percy," thomas huffed.  the barrier opened.  thomas rattled away.  "clacketyclong, clacketyclong." then there was trouble.  thomas began to chuff slower and slower.  "i need a rest," he gasped.  thomas clacketyclonged into a siding.  steam burst from his boiler and black smoke flew from his funnel.  with a final clacketyclong, thomas broke down.  thomas felt terrible.  the school choir began to sing to pass the time.  "the children will be late for their concert," thomas wailed sadly.  "and it will all be my fault.  i've let everyone down." thomas was upset.   just then, gordon puffed around the bend.   "i've broken down," groaned thomas.  "sorry, thomas," steamed gordon.  "i'm a guaranteed connection." "now what am i going to do." cried thomas.  he was worried.   then, thomas heard a whistle.  it was james.  "if i ask james for help, he'll laugh at me again.  but i don't want the children to miss their concert." so thomas tooted as loud as he could toot.  "stop." "bust my boiler," laughed james.  "i said you were a broken down little engine.  "i am," sighed thomas.  "so i need your help.  "can you take the children to their concert." thomas whistled.  now james didn't laugh at thomas.  he could see thomas was in trouble, and he was happy to help his friend.   "i'll get the children there on time," he wheeshed.  thomas knew he had to get back to be repaired as quickly as possible.  henry was sent to collect thomas.  he soon buffered up and shunted thomas to the fitters' yard.  before long, thomas was as good as new.  he had even waited for his final inspection.  sir topham hatt arrived.  "you have been very patient, thomas.  "i have a special job for you.  you are to collect the choir and bring them home again." "thank you, sir," chuffed thomas.  he was delighted.  "clanketyclong, nothing is wrong," he laughed.  and thomas smiled all the way to the concert.     . .        captioned by media access group at wgbh access.wgbh.org le blows) all aboard for an amazing journey.  let a child's imagination take you places you never thought possible.  lego duplo proudly supports thomas & friendson pbs kids.   . bob the builder . )
