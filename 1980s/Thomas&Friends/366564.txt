  the island of sodor is surrounded by beautiful blue sea.  it has fields of green and sandy yellow beaches.  there are rivers, streams, and lots of trees, where the birds sing.  there are windmills and a coal mine and docks where visitors to the island arrive.  the island also has lots and lots of railway lines.  who's that puffing down the track.   it's thomas.  hello, thomas.   hello, everybody.  welcome to the island of sodor.     q today on the island of sodor, toby looks everywhere for something special, and we meet one of thomas' favorite friends.  but first a new engine has arrived at brendham docks.  thomas is a busy and happy engine.  as he puffs and huffs across the island, he always toots hello to other engines and to children along the way, even when thomas is pulling heavy loads.  one morning, thomas puffed into brendham docks.  sir topham hatt was waiting.  you are all here to welcome the new engine.  his name is hank.  i've heard he's very special.  i've heard he's very strong.   hank puffed into the docks.  hank was very special.  he had red wheels and a bright red cowcatcher, and he was very tall.  the engines had never seen an engine like hank before.  hank looks as strong as a giant.  i'm sure he isn't stronger than a sodor engine.  now, thomas, i have three jobs for you.  first you must take new machines from the docks to the factory.  then you are to pick up stone from the quarry and deliver it to the shunting yard.  and lastly, you must pick up an old tractor from farmer mccoll's and take it to the repair yard.  yes, sir.  and you must take hank with you.  hank must see the important sights of sodor.  be back by teatime for hank's welcome party at knapford.   thomas buffered up to the machine cars.  hank chuffed alongside.  hello.  howdy, thomas.  now, you look like one of the finest little engines i've ever seen.   thomas didn't like being called little.  i'm a tank engine.   thomas thought hank was being cheeky.  those freight cars are way too heavy for you.  let me take 'em for you.   hank meant to be helpful, but it made thomas cross.  no, thank you.  i'm strong enough to pull much heavier loads than this.  i'd be happy to help.   but thomas was already puffing out of the docks.  at the signal, thomas didn't take the track to the factory.  he chuffed straight to the quarry.  thomas pulled ahead.  "i may not be grand, and i may not be long, but i will show hank that i'm stronger than strong," he huffed to himself.  thomas and hank puffed into the quarry.  now i'm going to pick up the stone cars.   hank was surprised.  hold your huffing there, thomas.  let big old hank take those cars for you.  no, thank you.  tank engines can pull very heavy loads.   so thomas heaved and huffed out of the quarry.  thomas wheezed and wheeshed.  handsome hank gleamed and glowed by his side.  children waved from bridges.  "  howdy.  good to see you.  hey, thomas, aren't you gonna whistle hello.   thomas hadn't the puff to whistle hello.  hank had plenty of puff.  this made thomas even crosser.  thomas pulled up to the halt.  he was nearly out of puff.  hello, farmer mccoll.  this is hank.  he's the new engine on sodor.  howdy, farmer mccoll.  that's a mighty fine tractor you have.  say, thomas, you look all out of puff and pull.  i'll take it for you.  no, thank you.   and the tractor was coupled up to the end of thomas' freight cars.  thomas huffed, and he puffed, and his wheels spun and spun.  come on, thomas, the train's too heavy for you.  take the pressure off your pistons.  couple me up.   but thomas was determined to pull the train on his own.  we must not be late for your party.   wheel turn by wheel turn, thomas puffed away.  thomas and hank arrived at maron station.  visitors waved at thomas.  thomas wanted to whistle back, but he hadn't any spare steam.  howdy, everybody.  thomas is a little overloaded right now.  i'll whistle for him.   hank had lots of steam, and hank blew the longest and loudest whistle.  then there was trouble.   thomas had cracked a cylinder.  the train was much too heavy.  oh, no.  now the deliveries won't be made.  you won't be back in time for your welcome party.  and i'm not a really useful engine or even a really strong one.  shucks, thomas, i'm so sorry.  that's too bad.  i wanted to show you that i wasn't just " i wanted to show you that i am really strong, so i didn't want to ask for your help.  but i do now.  please, hank.  i'd be happy to help.  you give the orders.  i'll do the pushing.   hank and thomas dropped off farmer mccoll's tractor.  the workmen were very sorry to see thomas had broken down.  next, hank and thomas chuffed into the shunting yards.  the yard manager was waiting.  the stone cars were uncoupled.  i hope you're back on track really soon, thomas.   finally thomas and hank delivered the new machines to the factory.  thank you, thomas.   hank pushed thomas back to knapford station.  they arrived just in time for the party.  thank you, hank.  now all of sodor knows what a strong engine you are.   hank smiled.  and i know something too.  you're the engine everyone cheers for on sodor.  that's something to be proud of.   thomas smiled.  hank was very special.  he was a very special new friend.   every engine on the island of sodor looks different.  can you tell who this is.  this engine has a tall funnel and a sparkly, shiny dome.  what else can we see on this engine.  it's the number 5.  do you know which engine on sodor is number 5.  here's another clue.  this engine is bright and shiny and red.  there's only one engine on sodor who is red.  do you know who it is.  that's right. it's james.  hello, james.          the island of sodor is home to lots of thomas' friends: friends on the rails, friends on the roads, and even some friends in the air.  they are all very different and each very special.  and they are all thomas' friends.  henry is thomas' kind friend.  he is a grand green engine.  thomas knows that henry always wants the best for everyone.  henry likes to believe in old stories and good luck charms.  one day, thomas told henry about the wishing tree.  henry was very excited.  he'd never heard of a wishing tree.  henry made a wish.  he didn't want to pull cars of logs anymore.  he wished he could pull the express.  the next day, gordon had to go to the repair yards, so henry had to pull the express.  henry's wish had come true.  but pulling the express was harder than henry thought.  the passengers had a very bumpy ride.  they rocked and rolled all over the passenger cars.  and when henry biffed the buffet car, cakes and cookies flew into the air.  henry didn't want to pull the express anymore.  the next day, henry saw gordon was still in the repair yard.  gordon looked sad.  he missed pulling the express.  so henry hurried quickly back to the wishing tree.  he wished gordon could be as good as new and pull the express again.  soon gordon was back pulling the express.  thomas could see that made henry happy, even though henry had caused confusion and delay.  another day, henry had to pick up the new flagpole ..  but he didn't look where he was going.  henry bumped into the flatbed.  the flagpole rolled onto the track, and salty rolled over it.  the new flagpole snapped in two.  sir topham hatt was cross.  henry had to find a new flagpole.  henry searched at the seaside, by the bridge, and at the airfield.  but henry couldn't find a new flagpole that was tall enough.  then thomas met his friend henry.  thomas was sorry for henry.  he wanted to help him.  thomas told henry he should never give up.  thomas was sure henry would find a flagpole somewhere.  thomas was right.  henry puffed to the docks.  suddenly, henry saw an old ship's mast.  it was tall enough to be the new flagpole.  thomas always looks out for his friend henry.  he knows that henry always looks out for him.  and that makes thomas feel very lucky.  gordon, mavis, and percy each have a special job to do today: pulling the express, shunting cars of slate at the quarry, and taking the mail car.  can you guess which job would make gordon feel really useful.  there he goes: around one bend and then around another.  but where's he heading.  to the express car.  gordon is pulling the express today.  it's the job that makes him feel really useful.  what about mavis.  which job would make her feel really useful.  she's on her way, through the curves, round the bends, but where will she end up.  at the slate car.  mavis is shunting slate cars in the quarry today.  it's the job that makes her feel really useful.  what about percy.  well, there's only one job left.  there he goes: along the track, twisting and turning.  but where's he going.  to the mail car.  percy is taking the mail today.  it's percy's favorite job.  it makes percy feel really useful.  mavis, percy, and gordon are each doing the jobs that make them feel really useful.  well done, everyone.   toby is a very cheerful steam tram.  he isn't as big or as strong as some of the steam engines, but he's always happy to help and willing to work.  one spring morning, toby chuffed cheerfully into tidmouth sheds.  good morning, everyone.   good morning.   sir topham hatt arrived.  henry, you are to take the mayor to the scottish castle.  emily, you are to take a party of schoolchildren to black loch.  and, thomas, you must take me to great waterton.   toby waited.  he hoped he would be given a special job too.  and you, toby, are to go to your shed and wait.   toby was disappointed.  his boiler barely bubbled.  this afternoon, you must pick up workmen and take them to great waterton.  yes, sir.   toby watched his friends steam off to their special jobs.  waiting at his shed wasn't a special job at all.  he puffed sadly away.  toby wondered why the other engines had been given specials and he hadn't.  "i know why," he thought.  "all the other engines have found something special.  "emily found the seals at black loch, "henry found the flagpole for the scottish castle, and thomas found " if i find something, sir topham hatt will give me a special as well.  i have plenty of time before i pick up the workmen.   toby puffed off to find something special.  toby steamed into the hills.  toby looked and looked, but he could see nothing special at all.  suddenly, toby stopped.  he could see a big red bird in a very tall tree.  "i've found something special," he huffed to himself.  toby puffed closer.  now he could see it wasn't a big red bird.  it was an old red rubber boot.  "oh, dear.  " and he puffed on.  toby steamed deeper into the hills and away from great waterton.  suddenly, he stopped.  toby could see something glistening and glittering in the afternoon sun.  "that's a treasure chest," thought toby excitedly.  "i've found something " toby puffed closer.  now he could see it wasn't a treasure chest at all.  it was a rusty freight car of old tin cans.  oh, dear.  that's not special.   then he heard a whistle.  it was whiff.  he had come to take the freight car to the garbage dump.  hello, toby.  why are you looking at old tin cans.   toby felt very silly.  he chuffed quickly away.  toby puffed sadly to a junction.  thomas was on his way back to tidmouth.  hello, toby.  sir topham hatt is waiting for you at great waterton.  bust my buffers.   he had spent too much time looking for something special.  now he was late.  so toby steamed quickly away.  toby huffed to the halt.  the workmen boarded henrietta, and they puffed quickly away.  toby knew he had to hurry to great waterton.  then toby saw something bright shining on a side track.  "maybe this is special.  now sir topham hatt won't be cross with me," toby thought.  but it wasn't something special.  it was an old piece of metal stuck in the bushes.  then there was trouble.  toby had puffed so far looking for something special, he had run out of coal.  toby felt terrible.  he hadn't found anything special, he hadn't delivered the workmen, and he hadn't been a really useful steam tram.  toby had to do something quickly.  he asked the workmen to hit the piece of metal as hard as they could with their tools.  and i will ring my bell as loudly as i can.  someone at great waterton is sure to hear us and come to our rescue.     sir topham hatt was waiting at great waterton station.  he heard the banging and toby's bell.  come on, whiff.  it sounds as though toby's in trouble.    sir topham hatt arrived on whiff.  toby, what are you doing here.   toby felt very silly.  i'm sorry, sir.  i ran out of coal because i wanted to find something special.  i thought then you would think i'm as special as the other engines.  but, toby, you are special.  but only when i'm really useful.  i know that now.  you'll always be special.  you're the oldest steam tram on sodor.   toby felt very happy.  now, let's fetch rocky and get that old metal to the smelters.   rocky quickly lifted the metal out of the bushes.  toby gasped, and so did sir topham hatt.  on the other side of the metal was a picture of a steam tram.  it looked just like toby.   toby, you have found the sign for the old great waterton tram shed.   toby's pistons popped with pride.  now, that's special.   and toby couldn't have felt happier to be a steam tram.      . .    . .   captioning bycaptionmax www.captionmax.com   all aboard for an amazing journey.  let a child's imagination take you places you never thought possible.  lego duplo proudly supports thomas & friendson pbs kids.   .  doink.   pbs kids. )
