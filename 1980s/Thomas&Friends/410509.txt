"at the end of the party, the great magician is going to do a big trick," boomed sir topham hatt.  : "i call it the grand finale," said the great magician.  "and i need some very special things for it." thomas thought this was very exciting.  "you, thomas, will collect them," added sir topham hatt.  "and if you do your job well, you can be inthe magic show." thomas was reallyexcited.  he really wanted to be in the magic show.  sir topham hatt told thomas to listen very carefully.  "first, you must go to maithwaite "to pick up a blue box.  "then you have to go to maron station to pick up "a red carpet.  "and lastly, you have to go to knapford to pick up a yellow sheet." but thomas wasn't listening.  he was dreaming about being in the magic show.  "can you remember all of that, thomas." asked sir topham hatt.   "yes, sir," puffed thomas, and he chuffed away.  when thomas arrived at maithwaite, elizabeth was making a delivery.  "i'm going to be in a magic show," tooted thomas.  "i've come to collect something for the grand finale." "how jolly," steamed elizabeth.  on the platform was a brandnew, bright red phone box.   "that must be it," whistled thomas.  and it was loaded onto his flatbed.  "next stop, maron station," thomas tooted.  thomas puffed into maron station.  bertie the bus was dropping off vacationers.  "hello, bertie," chuffed thomas.  "i'm going to be in a magic show." "that's nice," said bertie.  "what are you doing here." "i'm here to pick up something for the grand finale." on the platform was a stack of yellow beach chairs.  "that must be it," whistled thomas.  the beach chairs were loaded onto his flatbed and off thomas chuffed.  when thomas arrived at knapford station, henry was there.  "i'm going to be in a magic show," puffed thomas proudly.  "that's exciting," wheeshed henry.  "why have you come to knapford." thomas couldn't quite remember.  "i have to collect something for the grand finale.  something blue." "well," puffed henry, "there's a big blue flag over there." "that must be it," whistled thomas.  the blue flag was soon loaded onto his flatbed, and thomas puffed off to the party.  thomas was sure the great magician was going to be very pleased with him.  thomas arrived at the party.  the children were very excited.  they couldn't wait for the magic show to start.  "i have everything you asked for," puffed thomas proudly, "the red phone box, the yellow beach chairs and the big blue flag." the great magician was very cross.  "you have brought all the wrong things.  "i need my red carpet, my blue box, and my big yellow sheet," said the great magician.  "without them, i can't do my grand finale." thomas felt awful.  he had been daydreaming about being in the magic show.  he hadn't listened properly to sir topham hatt.  he'd puffed to all the right places, but he'd picked up all the wrong things.  "i'm sorry," he wheeshed sadly.  "i've been a very silly engine." the magic show was about to start.  then an idea flew into thomas's funnel.  "please, help me unload the flatbed.  then i will pick up all the right things," tooted thomas.  in no time at all, thomas was unloaded.  thomas knew he would miss the magic show, but he knew he had to be back in time for the grand finale.  first, thomas went to maithwaite station.  "blue box, blue box," he whooshed to himself.  and there he saw the big blue box.  thomas was pleased.   soon it was loaded, and thomas raced off.  next, thomas chuffed to maron station.  "red carpet, red carpet," he puffed to himself.  and sure enough, there was a red carpet ready to be loaded.   thomas was very happy.   lastly, thomas steamed into knapford.  "yellow sheet, yellow sheet," he sang to himself.  and there was the big yellow sheet.  it was quickly loaded onto thomas's flatbed, and thomas raced back to the party.   thomas arrived back just in time for the grand finale.  thomas had missed almost all of the magic show, but he was pleased that he had done his job properly.  the great magician began the grand finale.  "abracadabra."  thomas was amazed.  the children clapped and cheered.  "shazam." "ooh." cried the children.  "and now, for my best magic trick."  the children laughed and cheered.  and thomas...  was the star of the show.   here are some dots.  there are lots of engines on the sodor railway.  if we join these dots, it will make the shape of one of them.  can you guess which engine it is.  off we go.  there's the funnel.  it's a tall one.  and the dome.  it's a large dome, isn't it.  there's the cab and the coal tender.  do you know which engine this is yet.  here are the wheels.  and there are the buffers.  it looks like a little engine...  but it's an important one.  that's right.  it's thomas.  hello, thomas.    narrator: henry is ready to leave the station.  what's he pulling today.  henry huffs happily out of the station hauling...  horses.   henry huffs happily out of the station hauling horses...   and... hats.  now henry huffs happily out of the station hauling horses...   hats...  and... hot dogs.  can you remember what henry is hauling.  henry huffs happily out of the station hauling horses...   hats...  and... hot dogs.  i wonder what's next.  henry huffs happily out of the station hauling...  horses...   hats...  hot dogs...  and... hay.  can you still remember all the things henry was hauling.  let's see.  henry huffs happily out of the station hauling horses...   hats...  hot dogs...  and... hay.  i wonder where henry is going.  henry is huffing his way to a horse show.   the island of sodor is a wonderful place.  there are lots and lots of engines.  who's that puffing along the track.  it's thomas.  thomas is a bright blue tank engine with red stripes.  he has six small wheels, a short funnel and dome, and the number one painted in yellow on his tanks.  thomas is always busy and is especially happy when he's with his carriages, annie and clarabel.  thomas knows everyone on the island of sodor, but he does have one special friend, and that's percy.   one day, sir topham hatt told all the engines that the railway inspector was coming.  he would give a special prize to the bestturnedout engine.  gordon, james and emily were all sure a big engine would win the prize, but thomas and his best friend percy hopedtheymight win.  the big engines laughed at them.  thomas and percy had to work at the quarry.  by the end of the day, percy and thomas were very, very dirty.  percy was sure they would never win first prize now.  thomas wanted to cheer his friend up, so they raced to the washdown.  but when they arrived, gordon, james and emily all looked like the smartest engines on the railway.  now thomaswasworried, but his friend percy cheered him up.  when thomas and percy arrived at the coaling plant, they were surprised.  james biffed into a freight car.  now all the big engines, sir topham hatt, and the inspector were covered in coal dust, but not thomas and percy.  they won first prize, and each had a ribbon.  thomas knew he couldn't have done it without his friend percy.  sometimes you need to rely on your friends.  one day, thomas was picking up telephone engineers.  they were to mend the telephone poles.  a great storm had blown them down.  then thos saw something wonderful.  edward told him about an old story.  it said that there was something magical at t end oa rainbow.  thomas huffed and puffed all over the island.  he was looking for the end of the rainbow.  thomas was so busy, he didn't have time to say hello to his friends...  and he didn't have time to help his friend.  then there was trouble.    thomas hadn't seen the telegraph pole.  thomas was stuck.  he thought none of his friends would help him, but thomas was wrong.  all thomas's friends passed on the news that he was in trouble.  in no time, harvey arrived to pull annie and clarabel back onto the rails.  now thomas didn't want to look for the end of the rainbow anymore.  he wanted to be really useful.  later, thomas puffed back to tidmouth sheds.  there was the end of the rainbow, and there were all his friends.  thomas's friends are very important.  they make sir topham hatt's railway very special, and they make thomas feel he is the luckiest steam engine ever.   today, edward, henry and gordon all have different jobs to do.  see if you can guess who is doing which job.  one engine is going to collect coal, one is going to collect freight, and another is going to collect the express.  can you guess what gordon is doing today.  off he goes, around the bends.  he's on his way.  but what is he going to do.  almost there.  gordon is collecting the express at knapford station.  who's next.  henry.  what is henry doing today.  he's got a windy way to go, around the bends, steaming along.  henry is collecting freight from the docks today.  what about edward.  can you guess what edward is doing today.  he's on his way, twisting and turning and puffing along.  that's right.  edward is shunting coal cars at the coaling plant.  now they can all be really useful engines.  well done, gordon.   well done, henry.   and well done, edward.    it was a blustery, buffety day on the island of sodor.  edward's coal cars creaked and cranked against the wind.  percy's mail car shuttled and shivered.  but thomas hardly noticed the wind at all.  he puffed into brendam docks.  the mayor of sodor had ordered a brandnew sailing boat.  "i am to take the sailing boat to the mayor's launch party at the harbor," tooted thomas excitedly.  "the mayor, sir topham and lady hatt "will all see the boat go into the sea for the very first time." the boat had a tall mast and was painted bright red.  "it's wonderful," gasped thomas.  "it's redi should be taking it," huffed james.  "it's heavyi should be taking it," wheeshed gordon.  cranky lowered the sailing boat onto thomas's flatbed.  "it's not too heavy for me," tooted thomas.  "you must wait for the engineer to lower the mast," snapped cranky.  "the mast will be no trouble for me," thomas whistled, and he raced off.  thomas puffed proudly along.  the wind was strong, and the boat was heavy, but not too heavy for thomas.  thomas came to a steep hill.  he chuffed hard, pulling the heavy boat.  "i can do it, i can do it," he puffed.  and soon he reached the top.  "hooray." thomas tooted.  "i did it." he felt very pleased, and he steamed on.  then, thomas met emily.  "look at my sailing boat, emily," thomas tooted.  "don't you look grand," wheeshed emily.  and thomas knew he did.  thomas felt very grand as he steamed past elizabeth.  "be careful with that tall boat," she hooted.  "it's a very blustery day." but thomas felt far too important to take any notice.  next, thomas puffed towards a low bridge.  rosie was waiting at the signal.  "watch out, thomas." whistled rosie sharply.  thomas applied his brakes and stopped just in time.  "the mast is too tall to go under the bridge," puffed rosie.  "then i shall take another track," huffed thomas.  thomas chuffed proudly on.  then there was trouble.  he heard a loud crunch.   thomas looked up.  tall trees were hanging over the track.  "oh, no." cried thomas.  the tall mast must have caught in the trees.  thomas couldn't move forwards or backwards.  so he huffed and he chuffed, and with a mighty puff, thomas broke free.  "hooray." tooted thomas.  but thomas didn't know the ropes holding the sails had untied.  thomas was feeling very grand now.  the wind was strong.  it was blowing him along.  "whee." thomas cried happily.  he was going faster and faster.  the wind grew stronger.  thomas raced round a bend.   "be careful, thomas." molly tooted.  "the wind is filling the boat's sails." but thomas wheeshed by so quickly he didn't hear her.  the mayor, sir topham and lady hatt were waiting at the harbor.  they could see thomas racing towards them.  "slow down, thomas." boomed sir topham hatt.  but thomas couldn't slow down.  the mayor, sir topham and lady hatt could not believe their eyes.  thomas whooshed past and raced away from them.  faster and faster around the bend in the track.  suddenly, the wind dropped, and thomas stopped.  "whew. if the wind picks up again, i'll never be able to stop at the harbor," he cried.  "the boat will not be launched, and the mayor will be very cross." thomas knew that he had been wrong not to wait for the engineer at the docks.  "i must chuff back to the docks as quickly as i can, and i must bring the engineer to lower the mast," he tooted.  thomas was uncoupled from the flatbed, and he steamed off.  thomas's wheels whirred to a stop at the docks.  "has the engineer arrived, salty." puffed thomas.  "oh, yes, me hearty," smiled salty.  thomas was very relieved.  the engineer climbed quickly into thomas's cab, and thomas steamed off.  soon, thomas arrived at the sailing boat.  the engineer rolled the sails and lowered the mast.  slowly, thomas chuffed back to the harbor.  the boat was heavy.  thomas had to puff hard.  this time the wind couldn't help him.  the mayor, sir topham hatt and lady hatt were still waiting.  they were happy to see thomas, and they were happy to see the mayor's sailing boat.  "thomas," boomed sir topham hatt, "i see you have decided that full steam is better than full sail." "aye, aye, sir," tooted thomas.  and as he watched the boat slide into the water, thomas was very proud to be really useful.    . .        captioned by media access group at wgbh access.wgbh.org stle blows) all aboard for an amazing journey.  let a child's imagination take you places you never thought possible.  lego duplo proudly supports thomas & friendson pbs kids. )
