 hills and round the bends    thomas and his friends    the island of sodor is surrounded by beautiful blue sea.  it has fields of green and sandy yellow beaches.  there are rivers, streams, and lots of trees, where thng.  there are windmills and a coal mine and docks where visitors to the island arrive.  the island also has lots and lots of railway lines.  who's that puffing down the track.   it's thomas.  hello, thomas.   hello, everybody.  welcome to the island of sodor.      today on the island of sodor, james has an important train to deliver.  and we meet one of thomas' favorite friends.  but first, there's going to be a big celebration at great waterton.    thomas the tank engine and toby the steam tram are very good friends.  toby always tells thomas when he's worried, and thomas is always happy to help toby.  one bright morning, thomas puffed into arlesdale end.  hello, toby.  you look happy.  sir topham hatt has asked me to lead the parade at the first great waterton festival.   thomas was pleased for his friend.  that's because you're the only steam tram on sodor.  everyone will cheer for you.   thomas puffed quickly away.  sir topham hatt was waiting for him at great waterton.  he had three important jobs to do.  thomas raced into great waterton.  " waiting on the rails was another steam tram.  thomas, this is flora.  she's the new steam tram on sodor.   flora smiled her sunniest smile.   hello, thomas.  uh, hello, hello.  flora is to lead the parade with toby.   thomas gasped.  take flora to meet toby.  then toby must bring flora back here for the parade.   thomas was worried.  "toby thinks he's leahe parade all by himself," thought thomas.  "now he will be very upset.  i must keep flora away from toby "  thomas and flora arrived at the junction.  suddenly, an ideew into thomas' funnel.  "i will take flora to do one of my jobs before we go to arlesdale end," he chuffed to himself.  "by then, toby will have left " let's go to the wood yard first.  it won't take long.  that sounds exciting.   so they raced away to the wood yard.  thomas collected a flatbed of heavy logs.  now we can meet toby.   flora was pleased.   hooray.   she peeped prettily.  they set off.  "toby, toby, you must go.  hurry now and lead the show," he puffed to himself.  flora and thomas waited at the junction to toby's shed.  it looked empty.  come on, flora.   flora pumped her pistons perkily.  suddenly, thomas saw steam coming from toby's shed.  "cinders and ashes," he thought.  "toby's still here.  " flora, i've just remembered.  we must go to the quarry first.   flora was surprised.   if you say so, thomas.   and they puffed away.  at the shunting yard, thomas was coupled up to the stone cars.  now we can meet toby.   that made flora very happy.  "toby, toby, please have gone.  "lead the show.  be proud and strong," he puffed to himself.  thomas and flora arrived at arlesdale end.  this time, thomas was sure toby's shed was empty.  come on, flora.   "oh, no," thought thomas.  "toby's still there.  " flora, we're late to pick up my load.  we must go to the docks.  if you say so, thomas.   and they puffed quickly away.  at the docks, thomas was coupled up to his large load to take to great waterton.  thomas was sure toby would now be leading the parade.  come on, flora.   flora's axles ached, but thomas steamed strongly.  thomas and flora puffed up to the junction.  then there was trouble.  flora had chuffed too far.  she had run out of coal.  i'm sorry, thomas.   flora's wheels wobbled weakly.  thomas felt bad.  he knew it was his fault.  then he heard a chuff and a puff and a ring of a bell.  it was toby.  "thomas, i've been waiting " who's that.  cinders and ashes.   toby had met flora.  neither of them was at the parade.  thomas couldn't have felt worse.  sir topham hatt would be very cross.  flora, this is toby.  toby, this is flora.   toby looked very happy.  thomas was surprised.  i wanted to tell you, thomas, that i was too scared to lead the parade by myself.  but now flora and i can lead it together.  i thought i knew what you wanted, toby, but i was wrong.   now thomas had to quickly put right his mistake.  flora, take my coal.  i'll pick up more.  puff as fast as you can to great waterton.   toby and flora soon puffed away.  later, thomas chuffed into great waterton.  the parade was ready to leave.  thomas' flatbed was uncovered.  flora gasped.  she had a wonderful new tram car.  toby was pleased.  thomas watched his two friends lead the first great waterton parade.   the children cheered.  the brass band boomed.  now i have another best friend, and she is a steam tram too.   and thomas smiled his happiest smile.   here are some dots.  if we join the dots, we will see one of the engines of the sodor railway.  can you guess which engine it is.  let's join the dots and find out.  off we go.  there's the front of the engine.  it's very straight, isn't it.  and you can't see the wheels. they're hidden.  the back and the top, they're quite straight too.  do you know which engine this is yet.  it has a small funnel.  this is a very square engine.  there's only one engine that shape.  yes, it's toby.  hello, toby.        the island is sodor is home to lots of thomas' friends: friends on the rails, friends on the roads, and even some friends in the air.  they are all very different and each very special.  and they are all thomas' friends.  edward is thomas' wise friend.  edward is one of the oldest engines on the island of sodor.  thomas' friend edward usually knows the best thing to do.  but sometimes even edward can make mistakes.  one day, rocky arrived at brendham docks.  rocky was a crane that has no engine.  edward was surprised.  he thought rocky could never be really useful without an engine.  he would only ever get in the way.  so when rocky offered to help edward with his heavy load of telegraph poles, edward said, "no, thank you," and he puffed quickly away from rocky before the telegraph poles had been properly tied down.  then there was trouble.   telegraph poles fell all over the tracks.  the tracks had to be cleared.  but edward wouldn't ask for rocky's help.  he thought harvey could do the job.  that was edward's big mistake.  harvey wasn't strong enough.  he couldn't clear the tracks in time.  soon it was a terrible mess.  at last, edward was wise enough to know how to put it right.  edward collected rocky.  he pulled rocky as fast as he could to the junction.  rocky was happy to help edward.  in no time, rocky had lifted the poles, and the tracks were clear.  thomas cheered for his wise friend edward.  one day, edward wasn't well.  he had a lot to do.  edward was worried.  he thought that if he didn't do his jobs, sir topham hatt would send him to the scrap yard.  thomas wanted to help his friend edward, so he did edward's jobs for him.  thomas rushed and raced.  he heaved, and he hauled to help his friend.  but sir topham hatt was cross.  he wanted to know why edward wasn't pulling his own train.  thomas was worried.  now he didn't know how to help edward.  later, edward wheezed slowly into knapford station.  he told sir topham hatt that he wasn't well.  sir topham hatt didn't send edward to the scrap yard.  he sent him to the repair yard.  edward was very happy, and that made thomas happy too.  thomas and edward are two blue engines and two good friends.   percy, diesel, and james all want to go to the washdown, but emily is blocking their way.  she will have to move before any of them can get there.  who do you think will get to the washdown first.  here comes james.  but how will he get emily to move.   he's blowing his whistle at her as loudly as he can.  that's not very kind.  emily doesn't move, so james can't get to the washdown.  now diesel is going to try.  what will he do to get emily to move.  diesel is tryingo shunt emily out of the way.  that's not very kind at all, and it isn't working.  emily has put on her brakes even harder, so diesel can't get to the washdown either.  here comes percy.  what do you think he will do.  percy isn't whistling or trying to shunt emily out of the way.  he's asking her kindly.  "would you mind moving, "  it's worked.  emily is moving into the siding.  percy will be first to the washdown and all because he asked kindly.   james is a bright red engine.  he always likes to look his best, to do his best, and to show the other engines he knows best too.  it was winter on the island of sodor.  thomas, stanley, and james were working at the yards.  they were shunting trains to take to great waterton.  they had to arrive on time.  stanley watched james shunting his freight cars.  they wiggled and giggled.    james quickly biffed and bashed his cars into line.  you're the best biffer i've ever seen.  oh, that was nothing.  see how easily i can shunt heavy hector.   james collected hector.  stanley watched as james shunted hector to the back of his train.  snow started to fall.  i'm ready to leave.  i'll see you both at great waterton.  it's starting to snow, james.  you should check the weather with the yard manager.   james didn't want to be told what to do by a freigh especially in front of thomas and stanley.  i'll decide what we do.  the weather doesn't bother me.   so james buffered up to his train and steamed slowly out of the yards.  james puffed through the countryside.  the snow was getting heavier.  james stopped at a signal.  harold swooshed in.  there's bad weather all over the island.  it's very hard to see the tracks.  then, james, we better go through henry's tunnel.   james sniffed.  he didn't want to be told what to do by a freight car, especially in front of harold.  i'll decide what we do.  we'll take the track through shen valley.  it's the quickest way.   the signal changed, and james puffed away, pushing his train.  james arrived at the shen valley junct now the snow was very thick.  it made it hard for james to see ahead.  james puffed onto the wrong track.  james thought he was steaming through shen valley, but he wasn't.  he was steaming towards the snowy hills.  james saw edward in a siding.  he was wearing his snow plow.  the ice has made the line ahead very slippery.  it will be hard to shunt your train up the hill.   james was surprised he was in the hills.  "i must have taken the wrong track," he thought.  i've had to clear snow from lots of lines.   james was worried.  we need edward's help.  he could coupl  but james didn't want to be told what to do by a freight car, especially in front of edward.  i'll decide what we do.  i can manage on my own.   so james puffed slowly towards the hill.  james huffed and puffed.  he steamed and strained.  his face was now as red as his boiler.  james arrived at the top of the hill.  he was very pleased.  "now i can puff fast down the other side," he thought.  then there was trouble.  hector could see a snow slide had blocked the line.  hector knew that if james slowed down at the bottom, they would get stuck in the drift.   onwards, onwards.  don't slow down, james.   but james didn't want to be told what to do, especially by a freight car.  "i'll decide what we do," he huffed to himself.  so james applied his brakes.  the train smashed into the snow, and it stuck.  james couldn't make his delivery.  he felt very bad.   james is silly.  james is slow.  james has got us stuck in the snow.   james wished he had checked with the yard manager about the weather.  he wished he hadn't tried to find his way through shen valley.  and he wished he had asked edward to be his front engine.  now i know hector was trying to help me.   the freight cars giggled.  quiet.  please, hector.  how can i deliver my train on time.   hector was happy to help.   i'm a very heavy freight car.  we must race down the hill at full speed.  then we will biff the train right through the snow.  what a good idea.   so hector was uncoupled from the train.  james wheeshed and wheeshed.  at last, he had hauled hector back to the top of the hill.  okay, james. go.   or and james raced faster and faster down the hill.  there was a mighty biff, and hector pushed the train right through the snow.  "we did it, hector.  " hector was pleased.  stanley and thomas were already at great waterton.  james, hector, and the train arrived.  you made it.  we were worrie i wasn't worried.  hector helped me all the way.   stanley and thomas looked surprised.  you can always rely on a good freight car.   hector was happy to have helped, and james was happy to have a new friend.            captioning bycaptionmax www.captionmax.com ding.  ding.  male announcer: watching is learning.  orajel training toothpaste and arm & hammer spinbrush kids toothbrushes, proud supporters of healthy smiles andthomas & friendson pbs.     doink.   pbs kids.  was by contributions to your pbs station from viewers like you. )
