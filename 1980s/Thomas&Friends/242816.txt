"i know," he thought, " thomas arrived at the top of a steep hill.  as he went downhill, thomas started to roll faster.  thomas applied his brakes, but they still weren't working properly, and the squeak was even louder.  gordon was puffing up the hill.  slow down, thomas.   but thomas couldn't slow down.  he raced into an emergency siding, and he hit the bumpers with a big bump.  more of the special blocks bounced off his flatbed.  they tumbled down a steep bank.  now there was only one stack left, but thomas still didn't notice.  he was still worried about his squeaking brakes.  omas set off once more, very slowly, for the bridge.  finally, thomas saw the sodor river bridge ahead.  the builders were waiting.   hooray.  i made it.  here i come with the last special delivery.   with a clang and a crash, thomas clanked off the rails.  his flatbed bashed his buffers with a bump.  the last of the special blocks fell from his flatbed into the water.  cinders and ashes.  i've lost some of the special blocks.  oh, no, thomas.  you've lost them all.  now the bridge can't be finished.  oh, no, this is a disaster.   the workmen attached chains to stanley and thomas.  slowly, stanley pulled thomas back to safety.  thas upset.  " he huffed to himself.  thomas remembered the bump on the bridge.  it had made the last block fall from his flatbed.  "maybe the other blocks fell when i hit the other bumps," he thought.  thomas remembered where he had hit the buffers.  then he remembered going over the very bumpy track.  thomas knew what he had to do.  stanley, will you help me, please.  of course, thomas.  if you shunt me back along the track to the yard, i can show you where the other special blocks fell off.  that's a very good idea.  we must take rocky with us.  he can load the blocks onto your flatbed.  then you can bring them back to finish the bridge.   soon, stanley was chuffing along.  he shunted thomas behind him, and murdoch shunted rocky.  they reached the bottom of the steep hill.  this is where i bashed the buffers with a bump.  hooray.  there they are.   soon rocky had lifted the blocks onto stanley's flatbed, and they all puffed on.  thomas and stanley found the rest of the special blocks at the sharp bend, and rocky set to work.  soon stanley shunted thomas back into the yard, and he set off proudly with the special blocks.  good luck, stanley.  i was silly not to have asked for your help.  thank you.   a worker looked at thomas' wheels.  i've come to have my brakes fixed.  they make a terrible squeak.   later that day, thomas chuffed back to the sodor river bridge.  thomas put his brakes on.  there was no squeak at all.  he stopped right beside stanley.  my brakes are fixed now.  and so is the sodor river bridge.  all thanks to my friend stanley.    every engine on the island of sodor looks different.  can you tell who this is.  this engine is dark green.  it's only got a small roof ..  but it's got a very tall funnel.  do you know who it is yet.  here's another clue.  this engine's got very big wheels.  there's only one engine on sodor who has wheels like that.  do you know who it is.  yes, it's emily.  hello, emily.         the island of sodor is home to lots of thomas' friends: friends on the rails, friends on the roads, and even some friends in the air.  they are all very different and each very special, and they are all thomas' friends.  steamies and diesels aren't always the best of friends.  one day, neville arrived on sodor.  neville was a steamie, but he was square, so he looked like a diesel.  thomas puffed into the shunting yards.  he saw neville with 'arry and bert.  'arry and bert were giggling gleefully.  the three engines looked like firm friends.  thomas was surprised.  if neville was a friend of the diesels, thomas decided he wasn't a friend of the sodor steamies.  thomas puffed in to knapford.  soon all the engines had heard that neville was best friends with the diesels, so none of the steamies wanted to talk to him.  neville felt sad.  he puffed away towards the iron bridge.  then toby puffed in.  he told thomas that salty had seen 'arry and bert playing tricks on neville.  thomas felt terrible.  he had thought all the wrong things about neville.  now neville was puffing fast to the bridge.  it was thomas' job to warn the engines that the bridge was broken, but thomas had said nothing to neville.  thomas raced after neville.  neville puffed fast to the bridge.  he saw the barrier, but he couldn't stop.  he crashed through the barrier.  thomas raced up.  he had to rescue neville.  he heaved and he hauled wheel turn by wheel turn.  he pulled neville back from the edge of the bridge and to safety.  thomas and neville are now good friends, even though neville looks like a diesel.  dennis is a diesel.  and thomas quickly learned dennis knew all the diesel tricks.  it was thomas' day off.  dennis asked thomas to help him shunt his heavy cars of slate tiles for the school.  thomas is always happy to be helpful.  he puffed and huffed to help the new engine.  later, dennis told thomas he had broken down.  even though it was his day off, thomas raced away to find help.  thomas didn't know that dennis hadn't broken down at all.  dennis was just being lazy and playing a trick.  later, dennis really did break down.  thomas was surprised that dennis had come off the rails.  dennis told thomas that he had tricked him before.  that made thomas cross.  he had never met a really lazy engine.  so he decided to show dennis how to become a really useful engine.  thomas buffered up to dennis and his freight cars, and together, they delivered the tiles to the school.  sir topham hatt was pleased.  dennis was very happy thomas had helped him.  and thomas was happy to show dennis that really useful engines make a lot more friends than really lazy ones.   thomas, toby, and james need to collect their loads, but they don't know which load they will be pulling.  there's a freight car full of coal, there's a coach for pulling passengers, and there's some crates full of bananas.  let's help the engines find out what they will be pulling today.  can you guess which freight car toby will be pulling.  let's find out.  the track is very twisty.  toby chuffs around the corners.  i wonder what toby will be pulling today.  he's nearly there.  the freight car with coal.  toby's taking coal today.  who's next.  james.  which freight car will james be pulling.  james is chuffing and puffing, twisting and turning.  can you guess what james will be pulling.  he's nearly there.  james has got the coach.  he must be pulling passengers today.  now it's thomas' turn.  you can guess what thomas is going to pull, can't you.  here he goes.  keep going.  nearly there.  yes, that's right.  thomas is taking the bananas.  all the engines have found their loads.  well done, toby.   well done, james.   and well done, thomas.   gordon is a very proud engine.  he likes to do important jobs.  gordon thinks he knows the sodor railway better than anyone.  gordon was at knapford station, waiting for stanley.  stanley was late.  gordon had to take stanley's passengers on to brendham docks.  at last, stanley puffed in.  oh, i'm sorry i'm late.  i took a shortcut, but i got lost.  huh.  i never get lost.  i know the railway better than any other engine.  some very important passengers and a group of workmen are waiting at great waterton.  the first engine to arrive will pick up the very important passengers.  the second will collect the workmen.   gordon didn't want to pick up the workmen.  he wanted to pick up the very important passengers.  i need to get coal and water.  see you at great waterton, gordon.   and stanley chuffed cheerily away.  gordon was determined to arrive at great waterton first, so he raced off to brendham docks.  gordon delivered stanley's passengers and puffed away to great waterton as quickly as his boiler could bubble.  gordon puffed up to a junction.  he could see stanley ahead.  gordon was worried.  then he had an idea.  "hmm, if i take a shortcut," he huffed to himself, "i will arrive at great waterton before stanley, " so gordon took the other track.  gordon steamed happily along his shortcut.  he stopped at a signal.  duck was having a washdown.  duck was surprised to see gordon so far from the express track.  hi, are you lost.  would you like some help.  no, thank you.  i'm not lost.   and gordon chuffed away.  gordon steamed further along his shortcut.  "i should be at great waterton by now," he thought.  gordon puffed round a bend.  ahead, there was a bridge.   hooray.  that must be the great waterton bridge.   but under the bridge, it wasn't great waterton.  it was a repair yard.  gordon saw oliver and toad.  they were having their wheels oiled.  they were surprised to see gordon so far from the express track.  are you lost.  would you like some help.  no, thank you.  i'm not lost.   and gordon chuffed quickly away.  gordon steamed along.  now he was more worried.  his shortcut was taking longer and longer.  then he saw another bridge.   hooray.  here's the great waterton bridge.   but under the bridge, it wasn't great waterton.  it was the shunting yard of a logging station.  gordon had never been here before.  then, in the distance, he heard stanley's whistle from the track below.  "stanley's catching up," he huffed to himself.  "  gordon pumped his pistons.  then there was trouble.  ben was shunting a flatbed with logs.  gordon biffed straight into them.  the logs started to roll down the hill.  bust my buffers.  those logs will block the lower track.  i must stop stanley.   but gordon didn't know which track to take to find stanley.  gordon was lost.  what have you done.   gordon knew his shortcut hadn't worked.  now he needed to ask for help.  can you help me, ben.  i have to get to the lower track as fast as possible.  of course.   ben was happy to help.  soon the track was clear, and steamed away.  he had to warn stanley.  then gordon arrived at a fork in the track.  he didn't know which way to go next.  gordon saw oliver and toad puffing towards him.  please, stop.  i'm lost.  i need to get to the lower track as quickly as possible.   oliver was happy to help.  take the left track.   and gordon raced on.  gordon arrived at another fork in the track.  he didn't know which to go.  then he saw duck chuffing over a bridge.  please stop.  i'm lost, and i'm in a hurry.   duck was happy to help.  you must take the track on the right.  thank you.   and gordon steamed off.  at last, gordon puffed on to the lower track.  he could see the logs had fallen across stanley's line.  then he saw stanley chuffing around the nd.  gordon blew his whistle long and loud.  stop, stanley.  stop.   stanley applied his brakes and screeched to a halt just in front of the logs.  soon rocky arrived.  he cleared the logs in no time.  i'm sorry, stanley.  this was all my fault.  i wanted to take a shortcut.  i wanted to pick up the very important passengers.  but now i want you to collect them.   stanley was delighted.  later, the very important passengers were all on board stanley's passenger cars.  stanley felt very proud.  gordon puffed in to collect the workmen.  i won't be taking any shortcuts this time.   stanley laughed, and gordon smiled at his new friend.               captionicaptionmax www.captionmax.com )
