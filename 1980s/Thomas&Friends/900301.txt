"there's an emergency," he shouted.  "a big storm is coming.  "we have to get the sheep down from the hills.  " skarloey wanted to help.  so he puffed quickly away to the depot.  he had to tell the other engines that there was an emergency.  when skarloey arrived at the depot, his friends rheneas and peter sam were there.  so was mr. percival.  skarloey told him about the storm.  percival, "you must collect the freight cars "and take them to the top of the hill.  "then pick up the sheep and bring them safely " "yes, sir," peeped rheneas and peter sam.  they couldn't wait to get started.  as skarloey was being uncoupled from the slate cars, there was a flash of lightning and a roar of thunder.  skarloey was scared of the thunder and lightning, but he didn't want to tell his friends.  he didn't want to look silly.  rheneas and peter sam blew their whistles bravely as they puffed off to collect their freight cars.  skarloey tooted his whistle as hard as he could, but it didn't sound very brave at all.  the three little engines arrived at the bottom of the hill with their freight cars.  then there was an even louder roar of thunder.  skarloey's wheels wobbled.  he was very frightened.   "here i go," puffed rheneas, and he bravely chuffed up the hill.  "i'm coming too," tooted peter sam, and he puffed off bravely after his friend.  skarloey watched his friends disappear into the storm.  he didn't feel as brave as the other engines.  "i'm too scared to go up the hill with them," skarloey puffed quietly.  and with a sad puff of steam, skarloey reversed down a siding and hid.  skarloey waited.  he hoped no one would see he wasn't helping.  at last, rheneas and peter sam came down the hill.  their wagons were full of sheep.   skarloey watched the farmers unload the sheep.  then peter sam and rheneas puffed back up the hill into the storm.  they were being very brave.  skarloey felt bad.  he wanted to help, but he was too scared.  peter sam and rheneas worked very hard.  they puffed up and down the hill, bringing sheep safely to the farmers.    then there was trouble.  peter sam and rheneas had puffed up and down so many times, they both ran out of coal.  "there are still more sheep up on the hill," wheeshed rheneas sadly.  " chuffed peter sam.  skarloey looked at his two friends.  they were very tired and very sad.  then he looked at the farmers.  they were worried about the sheep.  "if a big engine like me is frightened of thunder, the little sheep must be very scared," skarloey chuffed to himself.  "i wanted to help the sheep, "i wanted to help the farmers, "and i wanted to help my friends, "but i haven't helped any of them.  " he felt terrible.  skarloey puffed slowly out of his hiding place.  rheneas and peter sam were pleased to see him.  " peter sam asked.  "we didn't see you," puffed rheneas.  skarloey sadly told them what had happened.  "i was too scared of the thunder and lightning to go up the hill with you," he wheeshed.  "so i hid, and i watched you working.  "because of me, there are still sheep on the hill.  so now i'm going up to collect them," he chuffed.   there was another flash of lightning and a roar of thunder, but skarloey didn't notice.  he pumped his pistons and puffed off bravely up the hill.  the lightning flashed around skarloey, and the thunder roared, but skarloey wasn't scared.  all he thought about was collecting the sheep and bringing them safely down the hill.  skarloey arrived at the top of the hill.  the farmer was waiting.  he was very pleased to see skarloey.  the sheep were quickly loaded into the cars.  and skarloey set off down the hill.  it was very hard work, but skarloey didn't give up.  he chuffed up and down the hill until he had collected all the sheep.  skarloey felt very happy.  "i'm braver than i thought," he wheeshed.  and he puffed proudly down the hill for the last time.  rheneas and peter sam were waiting for skarloey at the bottom of the hill.  "well done," they tooted.  they were very happy to see him and proud of their friend.  "three cheers for skarloey," the farmers cheered.  skarloey smiled.  "i didn't think i could do it, "  the lightning still flashed, and the thunder still roared, but skarloey was the happiest engine on sodor.    here are lots of dots.  join the dots together, and you'll see one of sir topham hatt's engines.  can you guess which one it is.  here we go.  there's the tall funnel and the dome.  around the cab.  and the engine's coal tender.  there are lots of wheels: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven pairs.  this engine is almost the same shape as edward, but it's a different color: red.  it must be james.  hello, james.      . .    . .     the island of sodor is a wonderful place.  there are lots and lots of engines.  who's that puffing along the track.  it's gordon.  gordon is a great, grand engine.  he is blue and has the number 4 painted on his tender.  gordon is one of the strongest engines on sir topham hatt's railway.  his special job is pulling the express.  "strongest and best, strongest and best.  cleanest and fastest " gordon wants all the other engines to hear.  one day, gordon heard something that he hoped none of the other engines could hear.   his engine was squeaking.  gordon didn't feel like the most important engine on sodor anymore.  diesel teased him at the docks.  he said gordon would be sent to the scrapyard.  gordon believed him.  gordon had a special.  he had to take children to the docks to catch their boat.  gordon found out that the slower he went, the less he squeaked.  so gordon went slower and slower.  sir topham hatt was on board.  he wanted to know why the fastest engine on the railway was going so slowly.  this made gordon very unhappy, so gordon decided it didn't matter if he was going to be scrapped.  he would make his last journey the fastest he had ever puffed.  gordon's pistons pumped, and his boiler bubbled.  he squeaked, rattled, and rolled into the docks.   but gordon didn't mind.   the children were on time for their boat.  and sir topham hatt didn't scrap gordon.  he sent him to the repair yard.  gordon knew he was an important engine.   and gordon likes to feel important.  one day, sir topham hatt told gordon that if he pulled the express across the island and back again on time, he would set a new record.  gordon was excited.  at the coal depot, his tender was loaded with coal.  gordon was ready to wheesh away.  then the yard manager gasped.  gordon had been given henry's coal by mistake.  gordon knew henry needed special coal, but he thought it would make him go faster, so gordon pretended not to hear.  he raced away.  gordon was very happy.  but henry wasn't happy at all.  there was no more special coal at the depot.  gordon saw how sick henry was.  gordon didn't feel important anymore, and he didn't feel happy.  he felt bad.  he cared about helping his friend.  and if an engine is in trouble, gordon will be there to help.  that's why it feels good to be gordon.    today mavis is wondering what she would look like if she had a face like her friend, emily.  mavis has a square face, but emily has a round face.  mavis is going to pretend that she has a round face too.  now mavis wonders what she would look like if she was painted the same color as emily.  mavis is black, but emily is green.  mavis is going to pretend that she is green too.  now mavis wonders what it would be like to be a steam engine.  now mavis has a funnel and steam, just like her friend emily.  mavis thinks looking like emily is fun.  but she likes being mavis best.    duncan is a very lively engine.  he likes to do important jobs, and he always likes to be busy.  one afternoon, duncan arrived at the wharf.  he had to collect freight cars of straw.  "more loads of straw," he wheeshed.  duncan was fed up.  " tooted thomas.  "i've been doing the same job all day long," grumbled duncan.  "collecting silly straw "and taking it up to the farms in the hills.  i want to do something " just then, rusty puffed in with freight cars of slate.  he looked tired.  "hello," he wheeshed wearily.  "i have so many jobs to do today.  " " asked duncan.  "next, i have to pick up some sightseers and show them the ruined castle," chuffed rusty.  "that sounds more exciting than delivering straw," duncan tooted.  "i'll take your passengers " "all right," rusty whistled.  "but only if you have time " "i have plenty of time," snorted duncan.  " duncan left his freight cars of straw, and he puffed off to pick up the passengers.  duncan had collected rusty's passengers.  and soon he was chuffing cheerfully through the beautiful countryside.  "look at the sights.  " his wheels clicketyclacked along the tracks.  duncan was enjoying his new job.  the sightseers were very happy to see all the wonderful sights.  "this is much more exciting than delivering straw," duncan wheeshed happily.  on the way across the lake, the sightseers got out to take some photographs.   duncan had to wait for them.  he wished he had something to do to pass the time.  just then, skarloey puffed up.  he was pulling freight cars of logs from the sawmill.  "flatten my funnel," he whooshed.  "these cars are heavy.  i hope i'm not too late " " duncan asked his friend.  "i have to collect sheep from the farm," puffed skarloey, " "that sounds more exciting than waiting here," duncan tooted.  "i'll take the sheep to market " "thank you," steamed skarloey.  "but only if you have the time " "i have plenty of time," chuffed duncan.  this was an exciting job.  and he puffed off to collect the sheep.  the sightseers were very surprised to be left behind.  at the farm, duncan coupled up to the cars of sheep.  "oh, this is a wonderful job," he whistled excitedly.   then duncan puffed off to market.  duncan clicketyclacked through the countryside with his sheep.  "this is much more exciting than pulling sightseers," he hooted.  up the track, sir handel was at the water tower.  " puffed duncan.  percival needs me for a very special job," wheeshed sir handel grandly.  "what job." puffed duncan.  "i have to collect the carousel from the transfer yards," sir handel chuffed.  duncan's boiler bubbled.  "that sounds more exciting than delivering sheep," he wheeshed.  " and before sir handel could say anything, duncan raced away to the transfer yards.  duncan arrived at the transfer yards.  he was feeling very pleased with himself.  he had had such an exciting day.  then he saw mr. percival.  he was talking to rusty and skarloey.  he was very cross.  "the farmer has just telephoned," said mr. percival sternly.  "his straw hasn't been delivered, "there are sightseers in his field, and his sheep " "bust me buffers," duncan gasped.  "i promised my friends i'd do a good job," he wheeshed.  " and now his friends were in trouble.  "it's all my fault, sir," puffed duncan.  "i wanted to do an exciting job, so i asked rusty and skarloey "if i could do their jobs, but i didn't " "you haven't done your own job either, duncan," said mr. percival sharply.  duncan knew he was right.  "i'll go back and deliver my straw straightaway," he wheeshed sadly.  "and this time, " at the wharf, duncan coupled up to his freight cars.  thomas was surprised.  "i thought you wanted to do something exciting," he tooted.  "i did," wheeshed duncan.  "now i want to deliver this straw to the farm.  " and he puffed quickly away.  duncan met rusty at the lake.  "do you want to help take " hooted rusty.  "no, thank you," chuffed duncan, " skarloey was unloading the sheep at market.  "next i have to collect some cows," he whistled.  " "no, thank you," chuffed duncan.  "delivering my straw " when duncan arrived at the farm, the farmer was pleased to see him.  that made duncan feel very happy.  he had finished his job properly, and he had been a really useful engine.      . .    . .   captioning bycaptionmax www.captionmax.com   all aboard for an amazing journey.  let a child's imagination take you places you never thought possible.  lego duplo proudly supports thomas & friendson pbs kids.   .  doink.   pbs kids.         . bob the builder . )
