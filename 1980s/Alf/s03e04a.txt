embery of the san diego zoo. this is ed mcmahon along with tommy newsom and the nbc orchestra. and now, here's alfie.  thank you. thank you. for those of you who don't know me, i'm alf, the answer to the burning question, "who's the only nbc star with more hair than michael landon." yo, ed. nice to see you. welcome to the tonight show, alf. ed was missing last week. so the cops put his picture on a 6pack of budweiser. ha. ha. oh. oh. also with us tonight is mr. tommy newsom. hi, alf. after the show tonight, tommy and i are going to go out and paint the town beige. i got the brush right here. good one, tom. you hang on to that. tommy's not dull. he was just weaned on novocaine. well, i'm glad all of you could get in, 'cause it sure was hot out there today. all: how hot was it. what am i, a thermometer. hey, we have a fabulous show for you tonight. we've got joan embery, joyce brothers, and a pope. so stay tuned. we'll be right back.  captioning made possible by lions gate home entertainment uh, alf. alf. oh, we're back. huh. hi. uh, i guess it must be time for our spontaneous, unrehearsed banter. you start. well, gee. ii don't know where to start. oh. well, you know, i really enjoy you on that show where they have all those mistakes and foulups. oh, you mean bloopers and practical jokes. no. star search. ah. ah. ah. well, your show is certainly a hit, alf. thanks. i understand you brought some clips. would you like to set them up. i'd love to. see, on my show, i play an alien life form. it's a real stretch for me. watch the monitors.    alf why did you do that. well, i could have licked your hand. but i didn't think either of us would enjoy that. what a strange family.  now what do you want. nothing. i was just doing the heimlich maneuver on myself.  by the way, don't bother looking for your laxative on a rope. oh, you mean my soap on a rope. trust me on this one. well, now i guess we know all about your rise to stardom. every possible thing we could want to know about alf, you have now told us. you are wrong, compensated spokesmanbreath. you mean there's more. yes. in my quest for stardom, i was screen tested for roles too numerous to mention. ok, i'll mention them. for example i did not get the role of obiwan kenobi in the movie star wars. i did not get the lead in the f. d. r. story. but i did get called back twice for the role of eleanor. and i lost out to mcgruff the crime dog for the lead in sam spade gets spayed. those screen tests look suspiciously like episodes of your show, alf. my cup looks suspiciously empty, ed. ok, i'lli'll get you a refill. thank you. and while you're gone, i'll show some clips of just how versatile a performer i am. you folks, watch the monitors. what about the pope. he can watch, too. roll the tape. hit the music, will you. i'm going to watch dance fever.  yeah, go feverettes. alf, i thought we agreed that you'd stop impersonating me on the phone. we agreed i would stop impersonating the cast of green acres. although  mr. haney could have sold brian some revivifying potion out of the back of his truck. i'm sorry it took so longalf. alf. ali'm not alf. i am melmac the magnificent. oh, no. that's johnny's turban. nobody wears johnny's turban. look again, banana number 2. i hold in my hands these envelopes. and without ever having seen the questions, i, in my mystical and borderline tasteful way, will define the answers. where are the answers. they're in the desk, but johnny's supposed to do those tomorrow night. so, who's stopping him. ohh. red square. alf, look, uhred square. what do you call that blotch on gorbachev's head. red square. red square. junk bonds. junk bonds. what do you call the last 3 007 movies. junk bonds. st. elsewhere. st. elsewhere. what's the message on mother teresa's answering machine. st. elsewhere. cat on a hot tin roof. cat on a hot tin roof. catboth: on a hot tin roof. name a tv dinner on melmac. ha. ha. wrote that one myself. i hold in my hand the last envelope. may an alien from a distant planet invade your living room every monday night at 8:00, 7:00 central. goodyear, bonzo, and bush. goodyear, bonzoboth: and bush. name a blimp, a chimp, and a wimp. oh, hey, ed. here, i had to take a few tucks in this turban. you might want to have it fixed before johnny gets back. oh, boy. there's more to come, so stay tuned. think you can fix it. i don't know. oh, i don't know, alf. you don't really explain how you do it, you just do it. it's like breathing. oh, come on. teach me. well, it only works if it's spontaneous. just do a little one. hioh. well, let me get this rightis the accent on the hi or the oh. alfhioh. you really should bring out our first guest. boy, ed. you're a real slave to tradition. we are honored that our first guest has chosen this show on which to make a rare television appearance. the spiritual leader of millions worldwide, ladies and gentlemen, please welcome dr. joyce brothers. alf. you should bring out the pope first. who's hosting here, ed. i'm waiting. you are, alf. dr. joyce, haul it out here. hello, alf. it's very nice to meet you. what happened to your accent. what accent. who are you. i'm dr. joyce brothers. oh, no. i got you mixed up with dr. ruth. huh. i'm sure it happens all the time. it's never happened before. oh. did you bring any clips to show us. i'm a psychologist. i don't have any clips. well, you're in luck. i brought a few extra. watch the monitors. well, the week is over, as far as i'm concerned. i'm going to have a plain old orange. willie, i don't think that i can make it till sundown. why don't we go away for the day. good idea. oh, come on, that's silly. now, why don't we just tell alf that he's won. well, i'm for that. you've won. won, ma'am. the bet is off. you can turn in your whisk broom and your phony accent and let out a big burp, and let's get on with it.    alf.  alf. what. what. what. what are you doing. well, i was sleeping till you woke me up. well, since when do you sleep standing up. since i started sleeping with that box on my head. you look ridiculous. well, not everyone sleeps like youmouth open, drooling on the pillow.  hey, lynn. you want to take over for willie. ok. your move. ok.  checkmate. so, doc, what did you think. well, judging from those clips, i think you have a little trouble meshing with the family unit. oh, yeah. so's your grandmother. that's a rather defensive attitude, alf. are you afraid to face a realistic assessment of your* i can't hear you * * i'm not even listening * * i'm the guest host * *you are just a guest * maybe i'd better come back at another time. i'm sorry. why. do you feel threatened when prevented from espousing tenets of your socalled profession, possibly revealing a lack of maturity on your part. so's your grandmother. way to go, alf. joyce brothers' been coming on this show for 25 years, and that's the first time she walked off. well, what did i do. she's the one who forgot to bring clips. uhoh. here comes the producer. oh, hi, freddy. it's fred de cordova, executive producer of the tonight show. alf, uh pope john paul. fred, john paul jones. your turn. um, there is a logical sequence by which we bring out guests on this show. world religious leaders, doctors, uh, people from zoos. so what. well, if you'll read your contract, if you don't do it our way, you don't get paid.  ladies and gentlemen, his holiness pope john paul ii.  so, what's the deal. his holiness is in the restroom. he drank a lot of coffee waiting to come on. so now what are we going to do. you could bring out another one of your guests. all right, all right. send out whoever you got back there. hi, joan. welcome to the show. ladies and gentlemen, joan embery of the san diego zoo. oh, joan, you didn't have to bring me a snack. this is felis catus, a domestic house cat.  my favorite. you know, i had planned on bringing a reticulated python, but somebody let him go and put this cat in his cage. it was probably the pope. he's been hanging around backstage all night. the pope told me you did it. hey, who you going to believe, me or the pope. did you bring any clips. clips. no, i brought a snake. well, i have a few clips i think you might enjoy. roll 'em. one minute to go, luckmeister. then i'll be down on you like a buzzard on a gut wagon.  the duck

expression "curiosity killed the cat". yeah. it's usually followed by the expression "pass the plum sauce.
