" the "boy who cried wolf" lied. he did. i've got to stop speedreading books.  ahhhhhhhh. oh, it was only a dream. i've got to stop eating styrofoam before i go to bed. ahhhhhhhh. ahhhh. ahhhh. ahhhh. ahhhhh. ahhhhh. alf, alf, are you all right. what happened. alf. hey, watch the shoulders. i've got bursitis. alf, what were you screaming about. it was horrible. trevor was after me. i don't see mr. ochmonek. well, he was here a minute ago. check behind the refrigerator. brian, alf was just having a nightmare. that is exactly what happens to people who stare into other people's windows. isn't he wonderful. the guy can turn anything into an object lesson. would you like us to stay with you for a little while. yes, please. forever. come on, brian. alf, try to get some sleep. i can't. i'm too wound up. i've been through a trauma. come on, lynnie. let's go to bed. good night, alf. 'night, alf.  good night, alf. okay, don't fall asleep. don't fall asleep. don't fall asleep.  ignore that. ignore that.  oh, heck, why must i be so darn curious. alas, poor mrs. ochmonek, i knew her well. oh, hello. is this mr. ochmonek i'm speaking to. jolly good. i'm doing a survey for the bbc and i wonder if you'd like to answer some questions. super. ah, first off, what would you say is the difference between american and british television. uhhuh, mmhmm. fine. thank you, mr. ochmonek. question no. 2, did you kill your wife. alf. gotta go. the queen just dropped by. what were you doing. just some impressions. you were harassing trevor. kate, i saw the man bury his wife in the backyard last night. look, don't you remember. you were dreaming. no, this was real. look, i took these pictures. these are all black. you wanted me to use a flash. the guy's a murderer. alf, please give your imagination a rest. justice never rests. what if i gave justice a cookie. justice will think about it. oh, no. alf. alf. oh, no. trevor, don't go into the den.   trevor, pick up the phone.  ochmonek residence. alf, why are you answering. it was ringing. you've got to get out of there. who is this. it's me. willie. oh, hi, willie. hey, i can see you through the window. alf, trevor is in the next room. get out. right. bye. oh, trevor. pick up the phone, please.   hello. oh, hi. tanner.  yeah. hi. hey, did you call just a minute ago. nooooooooooo. i mean, no. oh, that must have been the bbc.  the bbc. noooooooo. yeah. you want to know why their shows are better than ours. because they respect their audiences. i'll give you an example. last week, on the "benny hill show,"  benny meets this guy wearing high heelsalf, didn't i tell you not to bother trevor. yeah. how does this sound. ladies and gentlemen of the jurythat's all i've got so far. this is the last straw. oh, you say that all the time. this time islook, willie, you're upset, i understand that, but before you pop a blood vessel, let me show you something. exhibit a. chattering teeth. these don't chatter. they belong to mrs. ochmonek. this was her laugh. we know you didn't break in there for nothing. now we know you're a thief. this proves she was murdered. people don't pull their teeth and gums out while they're alive. alf, uh, those are false teeth. no kidding. well, let me try them. give me the teeth. i'm returning these and if you ever, everdo you understand. see the look he gave me. alf, why do you do these things. i'm a concerned citizen. first they came for the communists, but i didn't speak up because i wasn't a communist. then they came for the jesuitswe get the point. maybe we shouldn't have let dad go over there. yeah. trevor might decide to become a serial killer. they get a lot more publicity. mom, what if alf is right. alf, you're making everybody crazy. honey, trevor can't be a murderer. we have known that man for years. oh, no. what. what. oh, he's got his ice pick. he's walking towards willie. i knew it. call the police. honey, go into brian's room. you stay with him. i'm going over there. okay, i'll call the police. where's the phone. oh, here it is. ow. that's the coffee pot. willie, are you all right. willie. what's the matter. hi. what's that all about. well, well the lights went out and willie's afraid of the dark. you're afraid of the dark. it's not really something i like to talk about. trevor, um, could i ask you what are you doing with that ice pick. chopping ice. i see. i didn't know how to bring this up, but are these yours. no, they look like raquel's. where did you find them. outside. oh, i wonder how they got there. well, they probably fell out of her mouth. thanks for being honest enough to bring them back. no problem. well, you know, we really should be going now. willie, lynn is probably worried about us. i've got to get back to cleaning the bathroom. there's blood all over the place. willie, let's go. excuse me, is one of youthat's him. he killed her. what. what's she talking about. she's just joking. i don't think we should be making these accusations. look, some guy named willie tanner called. said you buried your wife in the backyard. why does alf always use my name. hey, tanner, why did you say that. you know why. you were seen digging a hole last night. ah, that wasn't raquel i buried. that was a side of beef. you expect us to believe that. yeah. i paid a guy it was heisted off the back of ai won it in a raffle. a meat raffle. all right. all right. then, why is there blood in the bathroom. from the side of beef. i cut it up so i could fit it in the fridge. any more questions. i don't think so. can i ask you where your wife is. she's at her sister's. the meat went bad and stunk up the house. she wouldn't come back until i dumped it. trevor, trevor, i'm so sorry. how could you think i'd do something like that. sometimes our imaginations get the best of us. trevor, we're really sorry. ah, forget it. raquel and i used to think you two were moonies, so we're no better.  not again.  nobody panic.  tanner, don't freak out.  officer, while you're in the neighborhood,  there's a guy named litwak down the block.  i think he's building an abomb in his basement. alf. oh, hi, lynn. what are you doing. this isn't what it looks like. you mean, you're not watching the ochmoneks. all right, it is what it looks like. you promised you wouldn't do that anymore. i know, but i have a good reason. i'm waiting for them to go to sleep so i can dig up the meat in their yard. i'm going to bed. do we have any beaujolais. good night, alf. sweet dreams. captions copyrighted by alien productions. all rights reserved. ) )
