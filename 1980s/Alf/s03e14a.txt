it was the motto of melmack super hero super cilious. super cilious. yeah. he captured a lot of criminals, but he was so darned smug about it. so, you with us. alf, it's too dangerous for you to be out here like this. well, unless there was someone who comes along to make sure i stay out of trouble. know anyone like that. uh i would like to see one of these creeps get what he deserves just once. yeah. yeah. you know, i should just turn this car around and drive the 2 of you home. but you won't. but i won't. yeah. sam scam. sam scam. both: sam scam. sam scam. now, you're sure your uncle's car is in good shape. i went over it myself from top to bottom. it's perfect. great. ok, here's what we'll do. alf, you stay here. lynn and i go inside and tell the guy the car broke down on our way to our honeymoon.  no, here's what we'll do. jake, you stay out here. keep an eye on alf. i'll take the car inside. ok. i'll run the camera. no. i'm the director. then i'll be the producer. oh, great. now i'm gonna have this money man on my back the whole time. don't stifle me creatively.    uh, good evening. what can i do for you. hello. are you sam. that's what they sewed on my pocket.  my car has been giving me problems. my engine's been making funny noises. and what kind of funny noises might those be. you know like when your earrings fall in the garbage disposal. of course. let's have a look see. or should i say, a hear listen. ha ha. willie: hello, congressman burdick. i have reason to believe that i've been defrauded by a car repair shop. now, i've been referred to every agency and bureau in the phone book. i've even spoken to the department of fish and game because somebody thought i was having trouble with my carp.  just a moment, please. hi, willie. i'm talking to congressman burdick's office, trevor. oh, that crook. you better watch your wallet. look here. ii almost voted for this man, i pay his salary, and ii want action. and i'll hold. hey, willie, have you seen jake. no. why. well, we come home and no jake. our duster's missing, too. well, you don't think jake took the car. nah. raquel probably left it someplace again. well, let me know if you see jake, eh. will do. hiya, brian. you're still on the phone. i'm holding, actually. why. well, if anybody calls and asks for b plus, that's me. who calls you that. jake. trevor was just in here looking for jake. do you know where he is. if i tell you, it could mess up operation: sam scam. brian. if there's something going on called "operation: sam scam," then i think you should tell me everything you know. i was sworn to secrecy. you should definitely tell me everything you know. oh, ok. jake and lynn and alf took mr. ochmonek's car to your repair place. why would theand alf. yeah. kate, i gotta go. i'm in a big hurry. i can't explain. i'll be back as soon as i can. say "hi" to alf for me. i'm afraid i have unpleasant news. what's wrong. bad carburetor and faulty distributor. the procedure will run you $200. $200. i don't have $200. not exactly meryl streep, but a nice touch of hysteria, none the less. alf. wwe got a problem. alf: hi, willie. willie.. you think this is all my idea, right. it's always your idea. i suppose you want details. lots of them. the ochmoneks' car's not broke, and this joker wants to fix it. capiche. really. wait. wait. i think lynn's going in for the kill. so, you're absolutely, positively sure that this engine right here needs $200 in repairs. that's my diagnosis. heard enough. excuse me, will you. i'd like to have a word with this quack. oh, wait. you forgot to tell me which is your good side. the one you're not on. alf, can i look through the camera for a while. jake, baby, you handle marketing and distribution. let me lens this flick, ok. tanner if you're here with more accusations, get off my property. dad, what are you doing here. dad. this is your daughter. yes, it is. sam was just explaining thatii was just telling her that everything seems to be fine. he said this car needs $200 in repairs. sami did not say that. are you calling my daughter a liar. ii'm not calling anybody anything. why is it every time i bring my car in here to get something fixed i go out with something else broken. i tell you what i'm going to do. you bring your car down here first thing tomorrow, and i'll take care of everything for 99. 95. mister, you're not going to get another penny out of me, and if i have anything to say about it, you're not gonna make another penny in this neighborhood. no, no. no, no. i'm taking a stand. this country was made great by people who stood up for what they believed in as robert if he starts humming the battle hymn of the republic, i'm pulling the plug on this production. can i expand on that. no man is an island, entire to himself. willie, on tv: and, if i might expand on that, no man is an island, entire to himself. every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main, and therefore, never send to know for whom the bell tolls. it tolls for thee. give me my money back. that was willie tanner, a gutsy consumer who decided to fight back and not let anyone rip him off. and here he is.  welcome to fight back, willie. way to go, willie. you tell him, dad. all right. they left my best stuff on the cutting room floor. without your videotape, the department of consumer affairs might have never nailed that ripoff artist. what would you say to other consumers who felt they were being ripped off and they wanted to fight back. fight back. very good, willie. however, we at fight back don't recommend that you attempt to videotape the ripoff artist in action. you should start by calling the department of consumer affairs or the district attorney's office. and when all else fails, call on your alien. david horowitz: when we come back, microwave milkshakes. have we really come to this. but first, a word from someone brave enough to sponsor us.  i guess you know what i'm going to say. you can't yell at me. i did good. well, yes, you did good. i mean well. but you shouldn't have done what you did do. so, you're saying it's bad to do good. no you're saying if loving you is wrong, i don't want to be right. what we're saying is, it's wrong for you to put yourself in danger for something that i'm perfectly capable of handling. we just don't want anything to happen to you. yeah. thanks, you guys. you, too, b plus.  hey, i wonder if horowitz is going to fight back against the guy who sold him that suit. captioning made possible by lions gate home entertainment captioned by the
