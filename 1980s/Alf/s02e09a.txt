" just like there were no telephones. they were called "those things on the counter that ring. " of course. it's as plain as this "breathing apparatus on my face. " that's your nose. why must you needlessly complicate everything . please continue. i just started going out with rhonda, when my planet blew up. unlucky in love, unlucky in armageddon. i'm sorry, alf. at least i don't worry anymore. when my planet blew up, i realized one thing. you have to live every moment to the fullest. look, willie, that's where melmac used to be. where . that spot where it looks like there should be a planet. look, a shooting star. make a wish. okay. what did you wish . i wished i had my planet back. oh, alf. cheer up, alf, at least you know your friends are still out there. maybe you'll meet up someday. maybe you and rhonda will get married. yeah, i'm still young. if i'm not married by the time i hit the big 400, then i'll panic. i guess you always knew you'd get married and settle down . actually, i didn't think i ever would. no luck with the babes . i had girlfriends. i didn't think i wanted to do the things my father did. what was he like . he was married, in the suburbs. wow, and you're his son. i'm sorry, go on. i wanted my life to be more exciting than his. that's why i started riding the rails. so, what happened . i met a girl in colorado. we were working in this restaurant. she was saving her money to be an actress. we started going out together. before i knew it, i fell in love. i never knew kate wanted to be an actress. it wasn't kate. it was linda evans. that's the truth. really . you dated her . way to go, willie. what happened . she set out to find the footlights and i set out to find the sky. well, you married the right girl. linda's much too busy. she'd never be home in time to tuck me in. glad you approve. kate's made me a very happy man. yeah, but you better face it. you did follow in your father's footsteps. but i found out there's a lot of adventure out there in the suburbs. there is buying our house, our first christmas, seeing lynn come out of the delivery room, hearing brian say, "dad. " what about that pesky alien crashing through your roof . that's certainly been an adventure. yeah, for me, too. willie, do you ever wish i hadn't crashed through your roof . never. thanks dad. hahaha . yeah. captions performed by by alien productions. all rights reserved. ) )
