thousand words. that picture was worth a thousand dollars. well, maybe the frame makes it look cheap. i am tired of your breaking things. if this happens once more, you will be living in the garage. from now on, i'll treat this house as if it were my own. treat it as if it were my house, and don't break anything . cheap frame . i guess it can be repaired. heads up . oops. ** i said i was sorry. how many times do i have to say it . it's gotten to a point where saying you're sorry isn't enough. what if i write it down . you don't get it, do you. get what . this whole idea of living together. we make rules and follow them to keep our lives from becoming chaos. if anybody breaks those rules you, me, or anybody then life becomes impossible. you're right. i don't get it. let me put it this way you're staying in the garage until we say you can get out. that i get. let me ask you something. did you act this way in your parent's house . no. i lived in their garage. oh, sure . draw parallels. just think about what i've said, okay . and we'll discuss it later. willie, please. you can't leave me out here. there are none of the comforts of home. all right. you can bring something out from the house. can it be something that answers to "hey, lucky" . just a thought. wait, i want to ask you something important. what . uhhh. uhhh. goodbye, alf. wait, i know. instead of wasting time learning how to behave, could i just suck up to kate . kate and i agreed about sending you out here. if anything, you'll have to suck up to both of us. thanks, i'll remember that. handsome. willie . willie . our furniture . we've been robbed . wishful thinking.  oh, hi. a housewarming gift. how nice. who said you could bring this furniture out here . willie. i did not . you said i could bring something from the house. i said something. not everything . in all fairness, you did not make that point clear. he did bring everything. i didn't take that hideous clock. that clock was a gift from my mother. did i say hideous . i meant lovely like your mother.  that's the microwave. brisket anyone . forget the brisket . alf, take everything back into the house tonight. and i emphasize everything . and i emphasize tonight . if you don't, you'll be out here permanently. i notice you emphasize the word permanently. wait, can we sit down and talk this out . just give me one minute.

our furniture & brisket. now, he's after us. you're right, of course. you stay in the garage. without us, and without our brisket. good night, alf. wait, please . give me another chance. i know i could change. let me move back inside for 1 week, and i'll prove it. i'll be on my best behavior. what if, during this week, you don't change . then, willie and i will move out here for good. all right. you've got a deal. kate, i don't want to move out here. i didn't mean the deal is you stay in the house for 1 week, but if you mess up, you're history. no problem.  the week hasn't started yet,

trade with me. the week is over as far as i'm concerned. i'm going to have a plain old orange. willie, i don't think i can make it 'til sundown. why don't we go away for the day. good idea . that's silly . let's just tell alf he's won . i'm for that . you've won . won, ma'am . the bet is off . you can turn in your whisk broom and phoney accent, let out a big burp, and get on with it . yeah, alf, let her rip . what we're saying is we want the old alf back. please, i must insist we follow this through. isn't that one of the rules to follow things through . otherwise, we'd have chaos. our life would be impossible. all right, we're leaving. we'll see you at 6:14. the sun goes down. that means pledge week is over. you can go back to being yourself. where are we going to go . who cares .as long as it's someplace dirty. goodbye, alf. bye, alf. bye, alf. see you after the metamorphosis. oh, sir william. is there some special meal you'd like for my last hurrah . aw, oh, actually there is

in the kitchen. the kitchen . i want to see it . lynn, why don't you see if you can find jeeves. trevor, i think we can handle this from here. thanks for waiting for us to come home. my pleasure. hope you don't mind i was a little hungry. i had some of the crispy duck, that was stuck to the wall. don't worry about it. have a good night. no need to close the door. yeah. mom, do you think alf's okay . i found alf. he was hiding in the dryer with grandma's rosary. i know what you're gonna say, and i've already accepted my fate. i'm turning myself in to the alien task force. i don't deserve to live. alf, why do these things always happen to you . beats me. maybe in a past life, i was a wrecking ball. you were so good all week. what happened . yeah, we'd really like to know. i'll keep it simple the kitchen blew up. this is like a roadrunner cartoon. alf, how did the kitchen blow up . well, the oven was on for awhile. then i realized i hadn't lit it. i struck a match didn't you smell the gas . at the time, i thought it was dill. well, goodbye, and good luck. oh, come on back, alf. you don't have anywhere to go. we don't want you to go. but, i failed. i didn't live up to the agreement. i don't deserve to stay. we know that, but you're staying, anyway. okay. come on, now. the place is a mess. we've got a lot of cleaning up to do. if there's alf proved this week, it's that he knows how to clean up. that was the new alf. now that i'm the old alf i'll get the push broom, milord. hey, how's it going. i thought you were taking these things back to trevor. they're not trevor's anymore. i bought them. actually, you bought them. your check's in the mail. hit the switch. you gotta see this. see what . trust me. just turn off the light.  tell me is this a significant moment, or what . it's breathtaking. captions performed by by alien productions. all rights reserved. ) )
