don't tell snout.  you know, i agree with you on this grades business. i never got better than a "d" on anything and look at me now. we've both come a long way. but you know, i realized something today. i didn't come to college for the diploma. i thought i did, but now i know it's really much, much more than that. i knowchicks. chicks are nice, but i'm talking about a whole new perspective. i realized somethingthese past 4 years have really opened my eyes. i know now my life's work is to make this place called earth a better planet. you sound like snout. i know, i owe him a lot, daddy. he's taught me there's much more to life than turning a fast buck. peace, don't get up. what's with the hat. you graduating. yeah, this place is like the white house. after 8 years they make you

room with me. fine, we'll give kate the attic. no, alf, we'll give you the attic. really. really. i think i can get rid of some of that stuff i got up there. you said that stuff was part of you. well, i thought i needed it, but as it turns out i don't. i still have all the important things i got from the sixties. you do. i may not be out marching on washington, but i'm a social worker, i still help peopleone at a time. i realized that's the way i can do the most good. and you get a sack lunch. it's a good life. cookie. i can dig it. where's alf. it's not like him to miss a meal. he's up in his new room listening to an album. i think it's the doors again. he said he'd be down in a minute. don't you guys miss the good old days. not for a minute. i think i doa little. but as much as i loved
