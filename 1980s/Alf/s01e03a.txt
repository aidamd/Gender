your eyelids are growing heavy. you are getting sleepy. you are no longer a cat. you are a bagel. hey. you scared me. you ought to wear a bell. what's going on here. i was ah i was just teaching lucky to tell time. show willie what you've learned. you were hypnotizing him, weren't you. okay, you caught us. i'm trying to help lucky with a smoking problem. it looks like it's once again time to restate the rules of the house. rule no. 1: we do not eat members of the family. willie, willie, willie. lucky and i were just kidding around. look, i've got to go pick up kate and the kids. while i'm gone, i'd like you to refrain from kidding lucky. no problem. i'd also like you to refrain from playing with priceless family heirlooms. it's broken. lucky fell on it. you know, it's not always true that they land on their feet. lucky. lucky don't listen to him. you're not a bagel. you're not a bagel. but you are getting sleepy. just kidding. "just take those old records off the shelf" "i sit and listen to them by myself" "todays music ain't got the same soul" "i like that old time rocknroll" "don't try to take me to a disco" "you'll never really get me out on the floor" "ten minutes and i'll be late for the door" "i like that old time rocknroll" "still like that old time rocknroll" "that kind of music just soothes the soul" "reminiscin' 'bout the days of old" "that old time rocknroll" maybe we should have called first. well i had the music pretty loud. i probably wouldn't have heard the phone. uh, i was planning to have the place spotless by the time you got back. when did you expect us back, in april. when i left, you said you're going to behave, but this is not behaving, this is mass destruction. i don't know what happened. i was sitting here, doing better than my best. i decided to make myself a little snack the rest is a blur. how can one alien be so irresponsible. i wasn't irresponsible, i was hungry. did you eat everything in the house. no. i don't think so. oh, wait a minute, here's something. who wants a cookie. i do. i'll split it with you. brian, why don't you go feed lucky. i hope there's some food left. you didn't eat all the cat food too, did you. no way, i draw the line at intestinal byproducts. how can you eat so much. i've been blessed with multiple stomachs. i don't understand why you don't gain any weight. it's all in the way of combine your foods. really. that's interesting. merv did a show on it. i have a tape somewhere. i don't believe this. merv says it works. of course, have you seen merv lately. forget merv. we're not talking about merv. no more merv. fine, he's off the air anyway. let's talk a little about how much food costs. i can't find lucky. oh, he's around somewhere. i looked all over. i wonder where lucky is. do you know, alf. hold it. no. i'll look around some more. brian, see if lucky's in the hamper, he likes rolling around in dirty laundry. who doesn't. alf, do you know where lucky is. you know lucky. he's a free spirit. last time i saw him, he was hightailing it out the window. and what were you doing. i was chasing him with a fork. just kidding. alf the last time i saw lucky, you were teaching him to tell time. what are you getting at. yeah, what does tell time mean. it means hypnotizing the cat into thinking he's a bagel. oh, you mean, you think alf might have eaten alf, you didn't. hey, hey, hey. we're treading onsome prety serious ground, here. these unjust accusations have litigation written all over them. i know my rights. i watch people's court. alf, did you eat lucky or not. willie, i know the rules. we don't eat members of our family. we don't eat members of any family. well, which is it. i can't find lucky, anywhere. well, maybe he got sucked into a parallel dimension. i've seen that happen before. i don't think so. oh, so i guess there's only one other explanation. the alien must have eaten him. well, i didn't. smell my breath. there's no lucky on it. that's the only thing that's not on it. alf wouldn't eat lucky. would you. i'm not saying anything until i talk to my attorney. maybe we're rushing into judgement, here. maybe lucky just went for a walk. i'm sure he'll turn up. it's a fur ball. lucky. don't look. hey, this isn't lucky. i was licking some jello off my arms and i swallowed hair. come on, guys, it's me you're talking to. alf. i haven't eaten a cat since i left melmac. brian. lucky was my best friend. come on don't cry. hey, what's with this family. didn't you ever hear the expression, innocent until proven guilty. not when the accused coughs up the victim. is there anyone here who doesn't think i'm guilty. maybe you ate him by accident. i see. well, the indictment has been handed down. thank you all for your support. call me when you finish building the gallows. oh, and here axhibit a. "dear family" no too friendly. "dear lynch mob," yeah, that's better. "i've been accused of a crime i did not commit. " "accused by people i thought were my friends. " "you say i am a murderer. " "i say, the only thing murdered today, was justice. " oh, yeah. that is good. "but, like david janssen in the fugitive," "i will travel the country in a desperate attempt" "to clear my name, by finding the one armed man. " that can't be right. "by finding lucky. " "i will search relentlessly," "taking time out, only to have love affairs" "with beautiful women. " "now, i must begin my journey. " "good bye, yours till niagara falls," "alf. " "p. s. these are tear drops. " yeah. oh, great. breakfast. thanks, mom. lynn. i'm sorry. i'm just so hungry. me, too. me, too. we better eat fast before alf gets to it. okay, i'll have "sugar shocks. " "sugar shocks" aren't good for you. how 'bout if i pour som nice healthy milk on them. how about if i pour milk on your oatmeal. chocolate milk. it's a deal. where's alf this morning. probably too ashamed to come to breakfast. or too full. i dreamed last night that alf came into my room and tried to eat me. brian, alf would never do that. of course he wouldn't. you'll sleep with us tonight. you know, i almost feel sorry for alf. why. i'm just trying to see things through his eyes. i'm trying to understand why he ate lucky. i meen, alf has different instincts than we do. on his planet, they eat cats the same way we eat cows. we don't eat cows. where do you think hamburgers come from. the supermarket. i have good news. brian, go get alf. i want you to look at something. what. i've analyzed the composition of the fur ball, and compared it to the clamp of hair, clomp of alf's hair, that i found in the ice cream. now, the composition of the fur ball, is the same as the hair in the ice cream. do you know what that means. it means that breakfast is over. no, it means alf is innocent. so we were wrong, we accused him unjustly. we've should have believed him. where's alf. i don't know, but i found this note. what does it say. skip the part about david janssen it says he didn't eat lucky. poor alf. it says he's gone to find lucky to prove his innocence. and his manhood. this letter even has tear drops. grape colored tear drops. he must feel so betrayed. i'm gona go find him. i'm going too. i'm coming with you. me too. alf is all alone out there, i'm realy worried about him. and he doesn't know about crossing on the green and not in between. that's right. where are we going to look. i don't know. he could be anywhere. yeah you know, we realy should have watched more episodes of "the fugitive. " so, uh, what are you guys in for. okay, be that way. just tell me one thing. that sign over there, does neutered mean what i think it does. i guess it does. anybody have a coat hanger. i'll show you how to get out of this dump. here we go, boy. xnay on the angerhay. i think the screw is coming. oh my gosh, he's got a horse. okay, who wants a roommate. there's an empty one. what are you doing without your jockey. just kidding, just kidding. this whole planet's up tight. come on, guys. let's loosen up. "on wisconsin, on wisconsin" jump in when you're ready, lets go. come on. "on wisconsin, on wisconsin" hey, hold it down in here. there you go. lucky. psst, hey, hey trigger. act cool. listen. you seem like a sweetheart, i'm gona let you break out of here with me tonight. yeah. here's the plan. we wait until it gets dark, then me, you, and that cat over there, are going to make a run for it. allright. look, all you have to do is gnaw through this wire mash. got that. good. xnay, xnay. well, there they are. take your pick. it smells terrible in here. you get used to it. some of us wouldn't want to. come on honey, pick a nice cat and then we can go. i can't be rushed. what is that monstrosity. that's a dog. i think. gas it. no one's gona want it. may i show you something in a tabby. i don't like any of these cats. i want one that costs a lot of money. come on heidi, i'm sure you can find something. oh, all right. i guess that cat over there doesn't look too gross. ah, good. nice choice. it just came in a little while ago. okay, there you go. what are you going to name him. what's your name. keith. not keith. let's go dad. thanks very much. you're welcome. looks like it's now or never. hey, hey. hold it down. did you hear what i said. be quiet, you're scaring damian. all right, all right, that's it. dad, that dog took my cat. stop him. they're here, lucky. i just can't wait to see their faces, when they see you. alf, you're back. thank goodness. we've been looking all over for you. before you say another word, may i present to you exhibit "b. " well, i guess this case is closed. it's a cat. it's not just any cat, it's lucky. how soon they forget. alf, i think you've made a mistake. alf. lucky. yeah, it's lucky. you know, it's a funy thing he was in mrs. ochmonek's basement the whole time. well, don't we feel foolish. now we have 2 cats. no problem. you're getting sleepy. alf. just kidding. there you go, luckheimer. oh, yeah. who'd ever thought we'd see the day, when they'd trust me to feed you. right now i'm in the catbird seat. sort of speak. right now i can get away with murder. sort of speak. right now, i could walk over to that refrigerator over there, grab a couple of slices of whole wheat bread, a little mayo, and slap together a blt. bacon, lucky, and tomato. yeah, i could do that. and they wouldn't even have the nerve to point their finger at the old alfer. no, they'd probably blame willie, before they'd blame me. yep. i could do that. but i won't. and why is that. because they trust me. but don't get too comfortable. ) )
