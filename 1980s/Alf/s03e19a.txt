"don't throw the shaker. " maybe if you do something that's bad luck here, it'll cancel out your bad luck. oh, come on, lynn. sounds good to me. come on, let's try it. it's bad luck to break a mirror. give it a shot. do you feel any luckier. no. this was kate's mirror. well, here. here, try this. i can't break that. just walk underneath it. that's also considered bad luck here. well, ok. uh. ow. ow. ow. ow. what's wrong. oh, i stepped on a piece of broken glass. are you all right. well, the glass doesn't hurt much but the salt that's seeping into the wound hurts like a martian head woogie. uh. i'll get you a bandage. good idea. i was getting tired of falling down the stairs every time i needed one. willie: oh.  ugh. oh. uh. does it still hurt. no, no. only when you laugh, right.  yeah. yeah. what happened. willie's dead. i'm not dead. dad fell down the stairs. are you sure you don't want me to call a doctor. no. no, i'm just a little shook up. ok. this is what i feared the most. what. in severe cases, the bad luck spreads to people the accursed one comes in contact with. it's starting. nothing is starting. i fell down the stairs because i had salt in my eyes. now i don't want to hear anything more about this curse. i won't say a word. how's the picture. perfecto. then i guess it was just a short in the plug. try to get a grip on reality, jake. it wasn't the plug. i'm cursed. what are you watchin'. that tv shrink. the one who helps viewers cope with their problems. well, is he any good. he's on channel 129. you be the judge.  hello. welcome to video couch. you are do i have to give my name. i don't want my friends and neighbors hearing about this. it would help if i could call you something. ok. willie tanner. how can i help you, willie. i'm a visitor in your country, and i did something that in my homeland brings a person bad luck. the only way to shake it off is for me to do a certain ritual, but people think i'm crazy. uh, willie, immigrants often have trouble assimilating into a new culture. if you feel you must do this ritual, go ahead. i can't. uh, see the things i need for this are far, far away in my galaxy. uh, mymy part of the galaxy. uh, our galaxy. yonkers. perhaps you'd feel better if you carried a good luck charm. you mean like a tupperware lid or a mouse. well, whatever's appropriate in your country. i tried that, but my bad luck is only getting worse. how's that, willie. it's spreading. see, people i come in contact with are having bad luck and getting hurt, too. and you think you have the power to affect other people's lives this way. we'll take our next call. i guess i shouldn't expect too much from a cable quack. what'd you do to your hand, mr. tanner. oh, nothing. that does it. it's too dangerous for you guys to have me around. you're gonna have to move. we're not going anywhere. wait, alf. i was thinkin'. why can't we at least try to do your ritual here. how. well, uh, there is a full moon tonight. but it has to be a green moon, like melmac's. you showed us pictures of your planet's moon. it's not green. well, it was when certain atmospheric conditions were right or when someone threw up on it. we could fake it. you know, uh, have everybody wear green sunglasses. jake, you're a genius. plus you've got good fashion sense. now, i just need the ceremony and to wear meat. i'm not wearing meat. please. i have to draw the line somewhere, and i choose to draw it at the wearing of meat.  i'll whine till you give in. you know, mr. tanner, it might help. all right.  yes. he's going to wear meat. what kind of meat are we talking about here. uh, pork, veal. whatever you prefer. uh, but no spam. i'll wear meat. why do we have to wear meat in this ritual anyway. because the high priest on melmac was also a butcher. did all melmackian rituals involve wearing meat. yeah, unless they took place on a friday, then we wore fish. no pictures, please. i feel like an idiot. hey, lynn, how do i look. a1.  brian, hurry up. we're about to start. ok, what is it exactly you want us to do, alf. basically just be witnesses while i apologize for my misdeed. ok, now start pouring this gravy in your hair. alf. all right. that part is optional. i'm just trying to make this fun, people. don't. is my hot dog on straight. you look fine, honey. it is now time to begin the bibliocide ritual. everyone put on your shades. does the moon look green. everything looks green. get on with it. ok.
