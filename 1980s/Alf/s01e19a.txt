you this late at night but, i just came overi was hoping i could get lucky. i mean, lucky, our cat. oh. at this time of night. well, we were worried about him. it's his first night away from home. yeah. i had a feeling. raquel, get the cat. i can't go near that cat. you know it makes my feet swell. oh, yeah. then you'll be wearing my shoes again. i'll get the cat. i'm sorry, raquel. that's all right. can i get you something. i just bought one of those international coffeesno. something without caffeine. no, no, no. i don't need anything from the kitchen. i can't find the little fella anywhere.  hey, what's going on in the kitchen.  alf. how long do you preheat these for a cat. give me that. ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha ha, ha, ha, ha. what's so funny. this toaster oven is it a toaster, or is it an oven. ha, ha, ha. why are you holding it. haven't you ever felt the need to just hold something. i just found the strangest thing an open can of minestrone in the kitchen. oh, that was probably the cat. your cat opens tin cans. it's amazing, i know. we're trying to get him on letterman.  oh, my. that better not be my cologne. here kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty. alf, we're going home. i want that cat. no. all right. who needs him. there are a million cats out there. give me your car keys. alf, we're going to go home, right now. no. ha. ha. ha. he broke my glass eye. i'll buy you another one. you got that right.  raquel, that sounds like your riding mower. oh, no. hey, where are you going with my toaster oven.  treed cat at 13145 "julio" st. what. "hoolio" st. . i hate this town. where was that again. oh, no, i should have seen this coming. what. we're running out of those little flags.  unit9, proceed to 105th and decker. investigate breakin at pete's house 'o' pets. well, here's look, dad. it's nowhere near julio street. alf can't be doing all those things. you're right, of course. how far can he get on a lawn mower.  all units in the vicinity, proceed to county zoo. investigate report of a missing tiger. oh, my gosh, alf. even alf would have more sense than to kidnap a tiger. yeah, you're right. lynnie, let's get in the car drive around the neighborhood one more time and see if we can find him. but, what if he's got the tiger. then they won't be hard to spot.  one, two, three you can't hit the beaches if you can't see your feet. three no luck. nope. we did find the lawn mower, though. oh, good, i won't have to buy raquel a new one. you will if you can't get the bonsai trees out of the blade. anything on the police scanner. just a couple of domestic spats. one of them was at the ochmoneks'. brian. honey, you have a headache. no, i'm thinking of a fork. i'm trying to get alf back. "metal" telepathy. i'm the one who let him get away. i've got to make him come back. honey, he'll come back when he can. if he can. by now, his 12 hours are up. i'm sure he's come out of it. he might not know where he is. something terrible could have happened. let's just try to think positively about this, okay. i'm sure that he'll be home soon. and he never misses "captain kangaroo. "  alf. excuse me, but you good people have a fork. the mind reading worked. oh, alf. alf, are you all right. yeah, yeah, fine. why do you ask. we were so worried. where were you. out. well, do you think this thing has run its course now. to quote yogi berra, "it ain't over 'til it's over." there's still one more stage. well, what stage is that. quoting people. and as mercutio said, "all's well that ends well. " no, no, no, mercutio said, "'tis not so deep as a well, but 'tis enough, 'twill serve. " oh, right. but "to err is human to forgive, divine. " plutarch, i believe. well, at least you've recovered. sort of. yeah. or, as marcel proust said "we are healed of suffering only by experiencing it to the full. " or was that marcel marceau. no that couldn't be right. marcel marceau said or in the words of dustan "it illbecomes us to jest "at a fallen potentate. and still less before he has fallen. " say, how much longer are you going to do this. well, if i may quote porky pig "thththththat's all, folks." and speaking of porky do i smell bacon. no. well, i'd like to. i thought you spent the whole night eating cats. i don't think i did. at least, i don't feel bloated. but now that you mention cats i do remember storing something in the garage. the garage. you, this way. if you've stolen any cats, they're going back immediately. you understand. no problem. i'll, i'll take him back right after breakfast. copyrighted by alien productions. all rights reserved. ) )
