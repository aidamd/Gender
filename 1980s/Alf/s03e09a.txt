well, i like the sauce that kate opens. how come there's weeds in this salad. they aren't weeds. that's radicchio. the whole idea of you cooking is radicchio. hi, everybody. hi. hi. oh, hi, honey. you're kinda late getting home. yeah. julie and i stayed after school to protest cheerleading tryouts. well, why would you do that. i was protesting because i think cheerleading is a sexist exploitation of the concept of woman as perennial spectator. julie was protesting because she was eliminated in the first round. mmm, pasta primavera. you see. lynn appreciates my cooking. sure, scrape off the vegetables and that pink stuff and it's great. anything i can do to help. what's this stuff. will you stay out of that salad. yikes. the radicchio is making a break for it. alf, i want

never realized there were so many pictures of me. let alone here in the garage. well, don't worry. you're not wearing lingerie in any of these.  well, that's a comfort. i gave the lingerie shots to willie. ok, alf, out with it. out with what. look, alf, i know you pretty well, and i can tell when you're upset about something. well if, uh, hypothetically speaking, something were to upset me, and i'm not saying anything has, buthypothetically. right. if someone close to me were to return to work, let's say, it might, in the cosmos of my psyche, create an emotional black hole. both: hypothetically. alf, why has my going back to work upset you so much. everything's changing too fast. what do you mean. well, you got a job now. lynn's starting college pretty soon. brian beat me at chutes and ladders just the other day. i wish things could stay just the way they used to be in the good old days. last week. alf, everybody feels that way sometimes, but listen, change can be a very positive thing. oh, yeah. every time my life changed, it seemed like my world fell apart. like when my world fell apart. alf, things do change. lynn and brian are growing up. i have a new job. and who knows. tomorrow, willie may decide to chuck it all and become a lobster fisherman. shellfish makes him wheeze, remember. i was speaking hypothetically. oh. but alf one thing never will change, and that's the fact that you're a part of our family. you decided to adopt me. i thought we explained that to you. it would make me feel a lot more secure about my position in the family. now, alf, you know that's impossible. i'll give you a dollar. willie: you in there. hey, great news. the strike is over. oh. ha. i'm gonna goi'm gonna go backi'm going back to work onon monmondawhy are there

radicchio. alf, haven't you been listening to a word i've been saying. well, i have been known to tune you out. alf, just because willie is going back to work doesn't mean i'm going to quit my job. not even if i say please. i'm sorry, alf. she doesn't take any guff, does she. very little. oh, did you need that.  hi, kate. hi, honey. hi, alf. hi, willie. willie, um uh, remember the first time thatthat i stopped working. um, it was when you were expecting lynn. well do you remember the second time. when you were expecting brian. well, you know i haven't been feeling too great lately, and,
