miss tasmania, your question is what do you say to people who claim you're just a beautiful face & body, without a brain .  uh, thank you. what are you watching . i think it's a united nations meeting. that's not the united nations. it's a beauty pageant. are you sure . they just asked the ambassador from spain what she would do for world peace. she's not the ambassador. she's a contestant. oh. that explains why the swedish ambassador was juggling. ** on melmac, the judges wore swimsuits, while the contestants sat in the audience. why were the judges in swimsuits, and not the contestants . the judges had better bodies. hey, kate. i'd like to see you do that. plate spinning was never my sport. hi, sweetheart. you're home early. where's rick . yeah, where's that jerk with the earring. he's still at the dance. is something wrong . no, nothing is wrong. lynn, what's the matter . alf, will you turn that thing off . but it's the losers' production number. alf, can't you see that lynn is upset . oh, sorry.  lynn, what happened . rick and i were having a good time at the dance. rick asked me if he could dance with cindy bennet. i said, "i suppose. " so he danced with her the whole night . is cindy bennet that blonde cheerleader in your yearbook . yes. wow . i mean she's not as pretty as you. rick's a jerk for doing that. cindy's gorgeous. any guy would want her instead of me. that's not true. honey, i know you're upset, but these things happen all the time. great, you've given me a lot to look forward to. that's not what i meant. let me tell you a story that might make you feel better. i was at this high school dance. this really cute guy started talking to me. we spent a wonderful evening together, until i learned he had left his date to be with me. and even though i kept dating him, i always felt that what he did was wrong. thanks, mom. i feel much better now. sorry. what happened to the girl who got dumped. it's not important. not to you. you got your guy. i think what your mother is trying to say, in her own special way, is that you're too good for rick. i didn't get that at all. it sounds like she's being punished for something kate did. don't you have a pageant to watch . i'm trying to help lynn. well, you're not. watch your tv show. fine . if you need me, lynn, i'm here for you. mom, do you think i'm pretty . well, of course you are. you are a beautiful young girl. you have to say that. you're my mother. dad, if you were my age, would you ask me out . if i were your age, and you weren't my daughter, and if i weren't married see, dad won't even ask me out. willie of course i would. you're a wonderful girl. you've got a great personality. thanks, dad. that's the kiss of death. lynn. i suppose you're gonna blame me for this. no, this isn't your fault. i know . i just wanted to hear you say it. watch your pageant. hey look . there's john candy. no, wait, that's miss bulgaria. what will you give me for a mickey mackerel card . what are you guys doing . trading bouillabaisseball cards. what's bouillabaisseball . it's melmac baseball. instead of a ball, they throw fish guts. fish parts. the guts are sold at the concession stand. sorry i asked. did these come with bubble gum, too . yeah, two flavors tabby and persian.  hello. yes . the miss southland pageant . you must have the wrong number. no, that's for me. you'll have to excuse aunt sophie. sometimes she's here, and sometimes we don't know where she is. what's alf doing . i think he's entered a beauty pageant. shhhh . yeah, uh huh. yeah . great, no problem. thanks, ta ta. are you gonna be miss southland. no, the contest isn't open to professional models. i entered lynn. what . hold that thought, kate. you're wearing that . there's a dress code for taking out the garbage . brian, take it out for her. our little beauty shouldn't be seen carrying trash. she was ugly enough to take it out yesterday. i'll give you a dollar. okay . you owe brian a dollar. lynn, you should change. the lady from miss southland will be here any minute. what . connect the dots, here. i entered you in the miss southland pageant. what . why would you do something like that . well, isn't it obvious . tell her why, kate. because, he's an idiot . thanks for clearing that up. i saw how upset you were after the dance. i figured if you won hey, you'd feel better about yourself. well, why didn't you ask me first . i was afraid you might say no. you were right. see kate, i'm not an idiot . i'm not entering the contest, alf. but, you'll win . alf, i want you to call them right this minute. tell them that lynn is withdrawing. see, even she knows i wouldn't have a chance . oh, real supportive, kate. honey, that's not what i meant. look, i'm not exactly beauty contest material. sure you are . hey, they loved your picture. what picture . the one from your sweet 16 party. oh, alf, i looked terrible . i still had my braces. don't worry. i whited them out . oh, great. now, before the contest coordinator gets here, we should go over your application. what application . the one on the desk. why did you say that my talent was clog dancing . well, it's not singing. i've heard you do that. i have never clog danced in my life . oh, it's easy. what do you do . you just clog up a sink and dance around it, right . you don't clog up a sink to clog dance. then, what's the dance where you do clog up a sink . there isn't one. well, i suggest we call it "the funky alf.
