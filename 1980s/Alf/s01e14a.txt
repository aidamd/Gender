" you're right. it is nauseating. i think that it's sweet. i mean, it lets us know that just because a person says a few unkind things about someone, it doesn't mean that they don't love them. so, by the same token, i hope you'll be able to forgive me when i tell you what an ungrateful, selfcentered little tramp you are. selfcentered, little tramp. just who do you think you're talking to, you bossy, loudmouthed freeloader. tramp. freeloader. they changed my script. i'm not going to sit here, eat toast, and listen to this. alf, how could you. i'm telling you, i didn't. they were hugging and kissing in my script. i had nothing about toast. and did you see that centerpiece. who's doing props over thererip taylor. i am sick of having this entire visit shoved in my face. where are the famous suitcases. mom, i don't want you to go. well, once again, you've brought harmony to our household. that's not what i wrote. here, here. this is what i wrote. read it. there's not one word of violence in there. i'm going to pack the rest of my things. come back here. you're not going anywhere. i mean, not until you read the scene i really wrote. you could at least give me that. just give me one good reason why i should. okay. i'll give you one reason: kate. now, come on. turn to page 18. let's all read it out loud. kate, you be monica. dorothy, why don't you be dorothy.
