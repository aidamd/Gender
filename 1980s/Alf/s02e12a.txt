* on the 82nd day of christmas my true love gave to me * * 81 cats abroiling  enough .  * 79 cats atoasting  enough .  * 77 cats asizzling  enough, alf .  not only are we spending christmas  in some desolate cabin with no running water,  we're not allowed to sing.  just don't sing about youknowwhat.  what .  roasting cats.  i didn't say roasting. i said frying, boiling, baking  you know what we mean.  right, no cat songs.  will there be snow .  hopefully.  great. no running water, no cat songs, and no snow.  we should have tied him to the roof rack.  why are we stopping here .  this is where we are going to spend our christmas.  why didn't you just get a manger . let's check this out. you check it out . i need to check out the outdoor plumbing. well . well . what do you think . it's, uh rustic. it's neat. i was about your age when i spent christmas here with my whole family. i don't think mr. foley has changed a thing. the kitchen could use some updating. look this is where we put our stockings. and the tree was right over there. on christmas eve, we drank hot cider, and sang christmas carols until the wee hours. this will be that sort of christmas a christmas full of warmth, love, and joy.  help, help . i'm stuck in the outhouse . hold that thought. careful with that box . that's precious cargo. what's in it . it's so heavy. your color tv. you said there wouldn't be any tv up here. there is no tv because there is no electricity. you can't run a tv without electricity. great. there goes the perry como special. what's in this one . your microwave. but it seems like a moot point, now. well, my dad lost his job, and then we lost our house. how do you lose a house . we didn't actually lose the house. we couldn't afford to make the payments, and we had to get out. it was the middle of december. we were literally out in the streets, when mr. foley heard about what happened. he said he had this cabin up in the woods, that he hardly ever went to, and we could stay there for as long as we had to. that christmas, we had nothing. absolutely nothing no presents, no toys nothing. i think that was the best christmas i can remember. where was mr. foley . he was at his house in town. i bet it had indoor plumbing. we got a letter that margaret was ill, and since they weren't using the cabin you jumped at the invitation. we're not getting through. it's just a phase. i'm sorry. i know we'll have a great time. * deck the dump with boughs of holly * * fa la la la la * here, willie, hang the holly. where'd you find it . out back. i like your sweater. it's the perry como look. it's stunning. it looks a little like it is. it's the present i bought for willie. take off the sweater. what are you doing with it . wearing it . i looked silly in your new robe. did you get me a robe . apparently. apparently  it's in the box next to brian's bicycle. i get a bike for christmas . oh boy . can i have it now . can you wait 'til christmas . okay. these are christmas presents to be opened on christmas day. they're supposed to be surprises. they're not from you, anyway . sure they are . look at the tags. to willie, from alf. to kate, from alf. to lynn, from alf. to alf, from alf. to brian, from alf. did you change the tags . when do i have time to shop . he changed the tags, he put his name on brian's bicycle, then told him what it was. i didn't tell him it's red. it's red  i just said that to throw him off the track. he is getting a red bicycle. not exactly. it's a bicycle kit. some assembly is required yes. some assembly  have you read the instructions . it requires pliers, a screw driver and someone with a vague idea of what they're doing. i think i'll hang the holly. dad, wait that's not holly. what is it . it's poison oak. kate. is this poison oak . i don't know brian's the cub scout. how can you tell . elementary . he wears a blue uniform and goes to meetings. are you finished . unless i hear laughter. i withdraw the cub scout joke. why do you think this is poison oak . it has kate, start pumping. running water would be handy, wouldn't it. you don't understand anything about christmas. you think it's just opening presents, and being a general nuisance. isn't it about time he had a little consideration for us . now, take that poison oak, and dump it out in the woods. and don't hurry back .  this is mr. foley. hi. nice to meet you. we were about to fix dinner. won't you stay . no, thanks. i'm on my way to deliver toys to the hospital. i stopped by to see if you need anything. toys . every year, mr. foley repairs toys that children have thrown away. on christmas eve, he takes them to the hospital, and gives them out not quite, willie. i deliver the toys to santa claus, and he gives them to the children. is mrs. foley any better . well, i mustn't keep santa claus waiting. good day. a replica of a batu spaceship . perfect for brian. doesn't fly. mr. foley is anything wrong . i almost forgot your christmas present. promise you won't open it until christmas day. a rolling catplatter . perfect for lucky. i'll give it to kate.  uhoh. margaret passed away two weeks ago. i didn't have time to write everybody. mr.

"how dreary would be the world if there were no santa claus. "it would be as dreary as if there were no virginias.
