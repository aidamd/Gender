well, alfer, it's up to you. an alien's got to do what an alien's got to do. when the going gets tough, the tough get going. this guy's gonna be rice pudding, yeah. freeze . don't you know what freeze means .  you in the house, come out with your hands up. mommy .  and that's what happened last week. **  hello . it's alf. tell him to come in here if he wants to talk to me. dad said to come in here if you want to talk. he says that's going to be a problem. hello, alf. oh, willie, willie, willie . what have i done . i don't know. what have you done . did you see "dog day afternoon" . where are you .  the house is surrounded. come out with your hands up. please hold. no dice . i'm armed, i'm dangerous, and i'm off my medication. the cops have somebody cornered in my house . as you may have gathered, i'm in big trouble. you're always in trouble. yeah, but even on the alf scale, this one's a humdinger. i need help . what happened . long story short i saw a burglar and scared him away. now, i'm trapped, and i'm scared . oh, the irony of it all. can't you make a run for it . i take it you didn't see the end of "butch cassidy" either. no, i didn't. you've got to do something. they might storm the house. oh, yeah. i've got hostages in here. think that'll hold them . or should i say that the hostages are nuns . no nuns. none . i'm coming over. okay, but hurry . these guy won't give you a grace period if you catch my drift. alf's trapped at the ochmonek's. i know the feeling. i'm going over. me, too. no, it's too dangerous. you might lose your cool when the bullets start flying. there'll be bullets . that's ridiculous. willie, be careful. i will. by the way, how did "butch cassidy" end . they were gunned down. it was really cool. i can dig it.  if any of you try to come in here, you'll be eating more lead than a pencil sharpener. he's bluffing. use the battering ram. we haven't got a battering ram. where are my tax dollars going . get back, lady. they're probably going to gary hart. you say you've got hostages. how do we know they're all right .  just a second . how are you guys .  fine. great. couldn't be better. there you are. uh, officer griswald what's going on . tanner, you finally called one right. you've got the burglar . not yet, but he's surrounded. are you going in . not while he has hostages. we're americans . we don't negotiate with terrorists. no . no .no . maybe i should go in there. tanner, we'll handle this now. you in there. if you refuse to negotiate, we'll have to use tear gas. yes . tear gas, tear gas .  tear gas, tear gas .  tear gas, tear gas .    where's the violence and mayhem when you need it .   thank heavens for sam peckinpah. everybody down, he's got a gun . so what . he doesn't have a gun. where would he get one . hey, don't think you're playing with a greenhorn.  i've got enough powder in here to blow up the chrysler building. the chrysler building is 3,000 miles away. he must have a heck of a charge. medic . bring this man a brain. all right, in there, hold your fire. tell us what you want. i don't want anything for myself, but the hostages are hungry. right guys .  you said it. sure are. i'm famished.  hear that . send us 5 pizzas, and a cat. a cat .  who said a cat . i did. you idiot . we've got a satanworshiper in here . gaffney, get the pizzas. aw, i got the food last week for the sniper. another squad car . alf's busted for sure. oh, no. if you can't do the time, don't do the crime. my dad's cell mate put that on a pot holder. don't worry. alf is not going to jail.  though a short sentence might do him good. will alf be all right . the house is surrounded, there's a mob outside, and the swat team's on its way. you be the judge.  the ochmonek's aren't here. if you don't mind, i'm a little busy right now. alf, wait. it's willie. prove it. what's your middle name .  francis. francis . haha . no wonder you never told me. haha . all right . sorry, willie, i'm panicking. listen, the swat team is on its way. well, that calmed me right down. this is doug gould, channel 6 news, reporting live from doug gould . that blowdried vulture . this seemingly calm suburban street is about to run red with blood.  wait, why am i worried . my blood is green. an undetermined number of hostages are being held by a deranged gunman. who are you calling "deranged" . you video tapeworm. with me now is officer izzy griswald, the first policeman on the scene.  hey, copper . where are the pizzas . what can you tell us about the hostages . they're hungry. actually, we don't know who they are, but we believe they're unharmed. that's good news except from a ratings standpoint.  sir, the food is here. excuse me. that was officer izzy griswald, who is in charge of the operation. and who might you be . i'm mrs. byrd, i'm doug gould. i watch your show all the time. you know my work . i know it, and hate it. we'll be back after this word from arby's. it's going to be a long night. is this the night we set the clocks back .  what's going on out there . some of us think we smell pizza. don't we guys . me, too. yeah . i smell it. wish we had some. yeah, the pizza just got here. come on out and get it.  i'll be right out.  don't come out. oh, yeah. we're not hungry, anymore, are we . couldn't eat a thing. wouldn't not me. touch it. shut up . thanks for nothing, tanner. i can't believe you did that. i just don't want anybody to get hurt. i can't believe the pizza arrived before the swat team. try waiting for the coroner. i have. maybe this guy just wants publicity. if we all leave, he might let the hostages go. maybe if we open the cell doors, the criminals would just walk in. wouldn't the criminals who are already in, walk out . your parents must be 1st cousins.  what's everybody doing on my lawn . trevor, raquel what's going on here . who are these people . somebody beheaded my lawn santa. there's a burglar in your house with hostages. that's why i left new york. excuse me, do you own this house . yeah. hey, are we on tv .  look at trevor. the camera really does add 20 pounds.  why do they keep robbing us . there's nothing left to steal.  why don't they break into the tanner's . that place is ripe for the picking. they've got a computer, telescope, waterpik it's like watching the home shopping network. look at uncle trevor . the camera really does add 80 pounds.  we'll continue live after this message. the ochmoneks are coming over. alf, hide in the kitchen. i'm losing it. i'm so worried about him. hello, everybody. did you see me on tv . you looked a little puffy. you know what they say. the tv adds about 140 pounds. i'm so sorry this is happening. do you believe our luck . why do bad things happen to good people . it's kahma. what's kahma . when your lawn santa is beheaded for no apparent reason. oh, you mean karma. i thought you were going to tijuana. we remembered that we'd left the door unlocked, and we didn't want anybody breaking in. now that point is moot. what's moot . somebody buy this kid a dictionary. i hope they catch that burglar dead or alive. don't say that.  why is he so concerned with the criminal . you taught him that . i've got better things to do than to corrupt him. i'm trying to corrupt her. mom, it's for you. who is it . it's uh harry. harry, who . hairy melmacian. oh right. make it quick,
