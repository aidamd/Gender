workmen have left for the day. they've been here for weeks. how long does it take to build a stupid baby nursery anyway. twice as long as they tell you it's gonna take. why don't you come out with me. we can play pin the tailpipe back on the car. it's not as bad as it sounds. i'm sorry, i can't right now, alf. kate and i are gonna have our first lamaze class this afternoon. what's a lamaze class. it's where expectant parents rehearse for the baby's birth. today we're gonna practice breathing. admit it, wilderness. this baby's become an obsession with you. well, of course it's an obsession. it's the miracle of life. it's the marvel of creation, the mystery of being. congratulations. you're giving birth to an episode of nova. and then, the doctor put the ultrasound machine on my stomach, and we could see the baby's head, and we could see the baby's legs. we even saw its heart beating. please, kate. some of us are eating here. since when have you been squeamish. since kate started talking about that parasite that's growing and changing inside of her. speaking of parasites, alf, are you ready for your fifth helping of meat loaf. don't mind if i do. when the baby gets here, are we gonna be able to tell it about alf. well, we'll have to eventually. you know, the funny thing about this baby is that it's going to be growing up with alf. i mean, to the baby he won't be weird or anything. he'll just be normal. don't mind me. i love being discussed in the third person. sorry, alf. just don't let it happen again.  i'll get it. hide him. oh, hi, raquel. hey, laverne. we're sorry

your house, laverne. well, we might want to sell it someday, you know. so, i was wondering, well, kate, since you're in the actual field of real estate, what, um, your thought about that. about what. laverne. hmm. kate could probably get a much better idea of what your house is worth if you take her outside and go over there for at least that would help a lot. now. if you wouldn't mind. you know, just in case we decide to sell it someday. well, all right, laverne. if it'sif it's that important. take your time now. ladies, you know the old adage. appraise and haste, repent at leisure. that one
