play quitting two days before the show opens.  look, we're sorry, sir.  sorry. the play is sold out.  every dork in town is coming.  now, i believe you two owe me an explanation.  it's personal, mr. belding.  i'm a person.  come on. let's hear it.  ..  we have to kiss in the last act, and it's a problem because we're both dating someone else.  and they're unnecessarily jealous.  no, they're necessarily jealous.  you mean that you two are falling for each other.  we don't know, sir.  it seemed like it.  yeah, and kissing again could cause more trouble than we can handle.  i see.  well, i must say that this is very surprising.  surprising, sir.  after all, jessie, you are president of the student council and an honor student.  ..  zack is, uhyou're talking about the man i possibly love.  all right. i'm sorry.  but quitting the play isn't going to solve your problem.  hey, i remember having a similar experience with natalie kendall.  who.  she was my best friend in high school.  one day i kissed her.  what happened.  she slugged me.  i had to kiss her to see whether it was love.  but we already did that.  well, somehow you need to find out how you really feel.  and if it isn't love, you don't have to be afraid to kiss.  what if it is love.  i'm stuck with an auditorium full of disappointed dorks.  hey, what's up, kelly.  hey.  slater, did you talk to jessie about what happened.  no. she's been avoiding me.  did you talk to zack.  no. he must be avoiding me, too.  do you think something's going on between them and they feel guilty about kissing.  that's what i've been wondering.  i can't believe jessie could fall for that wimp.  hey, i fell for that wimp.  it's hard to believe zack likes that neurotic egghead.  hey, that neurotic egghead is my woman.  wait. you know, maybe we're overreacting.  we don't have any proof.  yeah. maybe they were just embarrassed.  and they're avoiding us 'cause they think we got the wrong idea.  let's tell them we understand.  all right. let's go.  ..  if we're going to find out how we feel, now is as good a time as any.  are you sure this is the only way.  what if we still like it.  ..  even if it hurts.  i guess you're right.  i'll be brave.  jessie, that was great.  it was great.  i didn't feel a thing.  me neither. we're still friends.  we don't have to break up with slater and kelly.  i am so happy, i could kiss you.  go ahead. we won't like it.  wait. there's our proof.  don't get the wrong idea.  we were just kissing because we were so happy we didn't like it.  you wimp. we're through.  kelly, please.  slater, sometimes things aren't the way they seem.  forget it, you neurotic egghead.  we're through, too.  thanks, man. you're a real pal.  this is itopening night.  as your principal, i want to say how proud i am of each of you.  i know all the sweat that goes intomr. belding, they have to go on.  oh, oh.  in the tradition of the theater, i won't wish you good luck.  i'll just say break a leg.  places.  oh, places, places.  dorks.  break a leg, zack.  in fac breaboth legs.  i hope you two enjoy your kiss tonight.  don't worry. we got it covered.  remember what we did last night.  we'll be fine.   mirror, mirror, from the mall     say jessie, and i'll brain you.  i pass. next question, please.   what harm can there be in eating these      well, the dorks told me to be suspicious    but i'm tired of doing their shirts and dishes    you're a nice old lady    i have no doubt    so i'll sample that apple you're rappin' about   i hope you choke on it, beanpole.  what is going on here.  i wish i knew.   now that we see her lying there    we dorks admit we've been unfair    this evil spell your kiss unlocks    we'll split the cooking    and darn our own socks    dork number five, i gotta disagree    if you want snow white alive    don't look at me   that's not in the script.   to make her pulse accelerate    she needs a kiss from dork number eight    it's true the prince is just a friend    but studly for me is the living end    it's you i miss, studly, and not the prince    now that we've kissed, are you convinced.    ..uh...   well, at first i didn't like all of this drama    but now i trust you, so kiss me, mama    me and snow white was nothing but hype    oh, i like her all right    but see, she's not my type    so don't get me wrong    when i say what i mean    my heart belongs to this wicked queen   oh, zack. i mean prince.   yo, i want to announce to one and all    that i love the mirror from the mall    and if you touch me    i think i'll knock you through the wall    that brings our play to its conclusion    some things we said    might have been a bit confusin'    but we gave you romance and a lot of laughter    and hey, we lived happily ever after
