only.  you'll have to talk to zack later.  but iout. out.  i said this room is for people in detention.  you know, you're a dufus.  what's he doing.  what did you say.  i called you a dufus, you big dork.  am i in detention yet.  for the rest of the afternoon.  thanks, sir. thanks a lot.  i rushed to ask you what's the first thing you'll do in hawaii.  ..  now that you're in detention, you won't be able to tell my answer to ken kelly.  oops.  everything was going so well, too.  once a peabrain, always a peabrain.  his name is zack.  he's got 15 minutes to bring himself back.  the prize is down, but he's not around.  he might not win the tritritrip nnow.  i got to do something.  i got to be in two places at once.  belding he's trimming that bonsai all wrong.  you know about those dwarf trees.  i just finished reading the bonsai tree lover's handbook.  you're kidding. this is perfect.  i'll lend it to you.  i don't want to read it.  distract belding by telling him everything you know.  that could take hours.  well, good. go.  mr. belding, may i make a suggestion.  i happen to be a bonsai expert.  you are.  i have a black belt in pruning.  each branch's shape symbolizes an emotion.  psst. guys, i need your help.  get real.  one doublecross per day is our limit.  all right. i'm sorry.  if i don't get to the max, nobody will win anything.  he has a point.  i hate when that happens.  i can still win two tickets and prize money.  we'll work something out.  help me. i've got an idea.  too much foliage on the lefthand side symbolizes flabby emotions.  it means you're a nambypamby.  i don't want mrs. belding thinking that.  even it out.  exactly my point.  a clip clip here, a clip clip there.  shh. shh. shh. shh.  ah. now we're getting somewhere.  it's starting to look a bit thin.  thin is in.  it's bonsai, not sumo wrestling.  tada.  tada.  screech, there's nothing left.  you have ruined my tree.  if that's the gratitude i get, then i quit.  hmmph.  i tried, but obviously belding knows squat about bonsai.  10 seconds left.  ..8...7...6...  stop. stop. i'm here.  who are you.  zack morris.  nice try, but zack morris is a skinny little nerd.  hey, no, i'm not.  that nerd was my friend pretending to be me.  here's my driver's license to prove it.  well, folks, the real zack morris has finally arrived.  let's get on with the contest.  ask me anything. i'm ready.  answer these three questions and the trip is yours.  i'm packed and ready to do.  question number 1on december 7, 1941, this naval base was attacked by the japanese.  pearl harbor on the island of oahu, west of honolulu.  yes. correct.  question number 2it's a northern beach where surfers from all over the world come to hang 10. name it.  pipeline on sunset beach.  correct again.  zack morris, you are 2 for 2.  before that big question number 3, let's pause for this announcement.  zack, this is detention.  no napping.  ..i don't think he's feeling well.  you're not kidding.  you should see how pale and bony he looks.  what screech means is, he's been studying a lot lately.  it's hard keeping a tan in the library.  zack doesn't even know where the library is.  now wake up.  maybe you shouldn't wake him yet.  he can be really grouchy.  i said no sleeping.  you tyrant.  you starved him to death.  i think i know what's going on here.  no one leaves until i get back.  and now, for the third and final questionthis ancient hobby is practiced in hawaii and involves pruning miniature trees.  name this art form.  wait. i know this.  ..  ..  it's the stupid tree belding was playing with.  .. wait. it's bon...  bolshoi.  sorry. you lose, dude.  ask me another question. please.  sorry. no can do.  we still need a winner.  the next person that comes through that door and answers this question will win it all.  there you are.  and here's our new contestant.  what. who are you.  i'm rappin' ken kelly.  tell us what ancient hobby involves pruning miniature trees and win a trip for two to hawaii.  that's easy. it's bonsai.  bonsai. i knew it.  we have a winner.  finally i can get out of here.  i won.  this is the perfect anniversary gift.  yeah.  yeah. happy anniversary.  zack, i owe it all to you.  i thought you were just trying to skip detention.  oh, no, sir. i was doing this all for you.  it took weeks of planning.  maybe you'll do me a favor in return.  we'll talk about it.  all right.  in detention.  captioning performed bythe national captioning institute, inc.  captions copyright 1992national broadcasting company, inc.  ]  it's all right
