bythe national captioning institute, inc.  about up.  tomorrow we just need to head to lake tahoe.  it's important to get a good spot with ice fishing.  what's a good spot, dad.  it's all the same lake.  no, it's all about portapotties, christine, within walking distance and beyond smelling distance.  jimmy, i got a coleman portable.  we never have to leave the hut.  believe me, don, you use that, i'm leaving the hut.   hey, did you guys see a set of keys.  no, i don't think so.  i could have sworn i left them here.  they're my friend susan's.  i told her i'd watch her house while her family was out of town.  hey, wait a second, this must be hers, right.  look at that.  it's got an attack whistle and a little can of mace.  actually, dad, those are greg's.  when i work late, it's a long, dark walk to the car.  i think it's crazy for you to carry all this stuff on a chain.  i mean, a pretty thing like you could just grow her nails long and just scratch their eyes out.  found them. never mind.  couldn't have found those five seconds ago, could you.  girls, i cannot tell you how much i thank you for signing us up for that tournament.  i mean, jimmy and i, we've been ice fishing before, but this is the first time in my whole life that i've ever gone to a tournament, father and son.  we thought it would be nice for you to finally participate in a real fatherson event.  i love you, but there are some things a dad with daughters just can't do.  drink beer and go to the track.  no.  christine and i have gotten drunk plenty of times.  couple times at the track.  well, i think it's good that you can share this fishing trip with jimmy.  yeah, that's right.  jimmy, with you, i can do all of these things.  you are the son that i never had.  and you have greg.  ppbbhhtt.  you don't have to snort and grunt.  now that you're walking upright, i think you're ready for words, or at least a cave painting.  greg, normally i would attack you for saying something like that, but you have your whistle.  1, 2, 3.  . you got a wife and kid in love with you .  .  . you swear to god they're poking fun at you .  .  . you live your life the best you can .  .  . till your family screws up the plan .  .  . a family is family is family .  .  . a family is family is family .  . yes, dear .  . yes, dear, yes, dear .  okay, i just have to water the plants, and then we can head to the mall.  oh, my gosh.  look at this place.  they've got a massage chair, plasma tv, one of those cool cd players.  sheesh, these people are living in the "sharper image" catalog.  oh, shut up.  they have a jacuzzi in their living room.  hey, did you see this talking picture frame.  i was thinking about getting mom one of these for christmas.  child: i love you, mommy.  aw, that's so cute.  mom would love that.  let me see it.  that's weird.  battery must've died.  nothing's happening.  let me try.  that's weird.  battery must've died.  nothing's happening.  i'm sure susan won't notice her child is saying something different and now has a voice that's been ravaged by years and years of alcohol and tobacco abuse.  it was an accident.  christine, this woman is the president of the pta.  i don't need her telling everybody i screwed up her house.  i have an idea.  just be quiet for a second.   i love you, mommy.  ooh, that's good.  i love you, mommy.  ooh, that's good.  i'm just gonna iii'm gonna go stand outside.  yeah.  hey.  hey.  thanks for agreeing to let my dad use our bed tonight.  oh, hey, the least i can do is let him sleep on my bed since he does let me sleep on you.  what are you watching.  oh, discovery channel.  check out these praying mantises.  they do it hanging upside down.  and then when they're done, the female bites the guy's head off.   fascinating.  you wanna try it.  absolutely.  is it like that.  ahh.  ahh.  is your back feeling any better.  no, it's worse.  i think we've discovered why you've never heard this phrase in the english language "and they were going at it " ahh.  greg: what's wrong with you.  i did something to my back.  oh, my god.  what happened.  jimmy and i were fooling around last night, and when he tried no, no, no, no.  we get it.  so much for ice fishing.  i'm gonna have to spend the whole weekend lying on this couch.  well, you may have broken your back, but at least you haven't broken your routine.  man, dad is gonna be crushed.  he can't go to a fatherandson fishing tournament by himself.   don't even think about it. no.  please, greg.  kim, have you noticed.  the man hates me.  oh, he doesn't hate you.  remember that family photo we sent him.  he cut me out of it.  that's because he wanted to fit it into that antique frame.  i was in the middle.  he had to cut it twice and tape it together.  the floor lamp made it in the picture, but i didn't.  honey, this trip means so much to him.  the man had two daughters.  he always stuck doing girly things with us, like playing dolls, but his heart was never in it.  yeah, at one of our tea parties, he dozed off with a cigarette in his hand and melted one of my barbie's boobs.  barbie went right on with her life, ..ken stopped coming around.  greg, you always said you wanted to have a better relationship with my father.  i've tried everything i know how to do, and nothing ever works.  try fishing.  it's perfect.  he definitely loves fishing more than he hates you.  i don't even know how to fish.  my uncle took me once.  i cast my line out, hooked an owl, and flung him 30 feet into the lake.  owls don't know how to swim, by the way.  but you can hear their panic hooting two feet underwater.  greg, the fact that you don't know how to fish makes it even better.  he can teach you, like he would his own son.  i don't know.  don and i didn't exactly start out as best friends, either.  yeah, well, the first time you ..  hiding under his daughter.  yes, but then that summer, he wanted to build a deck, and i like building things, so i helped him out.  and we did it together, just the two of us, and in a couple of weeks, we were friends.  i'd like to be the man's friend, believe me.  it would make things easier.  i guess it would just be the two of us up there all weekend.  at some point, we'd have to bond a little.  give it a try.  let's go, jimmy, we got fish to catch.  bad news, i hurt my back.  i can't go fishing.  .  greg's gonna go with you instead.  .  don, i know things haven't always been perfect between us.  but i think maybe jimmy getting hurt gives us a chance to, you know, get to know each other a little better.  and i know i, for one, am looking forward to it.  jimmy, come on, i'll carry you.  no, dad dad, he can't go.  what.  are you telling me either i go with greg or the trip is off.  yeah, that's right.  i i gotta decide now, huh.  dad.  okay, fine, fine.  i'll go with gregory.  come on, let's go.  all right, don, let's go throw the gear in the car and head out for the great american outdoors.  let's hope the fish are biting and the mosquitoes aren't.  how old is dominic.  hi, may i help you.  yes, i hear progressive has lots of discounts on car insurance.  can i get in on that.  are you a safe driver.

winter.  i mean, it's spectacular.  look how the sun glistens off the ice.  it's it's so pristine.  hey, emily dickinson, you're spilling the cooler.  next to bait, beer is the second most important thing on a fishing trip.  yeah, i like the way you think, buddy.  let's lighten that load a little bit.  ah, here you go.  what are you doing.  i was just throwing you a frosty beer, buddy.  30 in the morning.  you think i'm an alcoholic.  name.  don ludke.  and son.  soninlaw.  inlaw.  whatever.  you got your 30 bucks.  i got it, don, don't worry about it.  i got the entry fee.  greg, forget it.  forget it, please.  the benefit that i get from you paying is offset by my terror that you will soon be nude.  okay, we're in.  okay, now, let's try and stay away from the windows.  and, oh, you know what.  don't touch any picture frames.  okay.  okay, so, we got a couple hours before kim and the kids are back from the park.  here's the massage chair.  you know, jimmy, i think, uh, you sit in this thing for a good hour, your back's gonna feel a whole lot better.  jimmy.  sorry.  looked so good, i couldn't resist.  all right.  man, isn't this great.  you know, it's not every day that we get the full run of someone else's house.  oh, no, wait, that is every day, isn't it.   okay, let's get our lines in the water.  if you feel like catching a fish, greg, i suggest you put on a numbereight aberdeen with a single wax worm.  don, i don't know what a numbereight aberdeen is.  in the tackle box, top shelf.  which one's the tackle box.  next to the bait box.  the bait box.  bait box, not quite sure.  come here, come here, i'll do it.  this is quite a treat for me, you taking me fishing and all.  my dad never did that.  that's why i don't know any of this stuff.  yeah, well, maybe better late than never.  all you gotta do is clamp on one of those sinkers about a foot away from the hook.  think you can do that.  sure.  that's 50 cents you owe me.  sorry.  oh.  that's $1.  you know what, greg.  i don't think the fish are scared enough.  perhaps you have a cherry bomb you could toss down there.   kim.  christine.   jimmy.  what are you guys .  ..came to fix the picture frame, huh.  look.  i love you, mommy.  jimmy: man, that is one ugly kid.  you guys are like hermit crabs.  you find an empty shell, you crawl right in and make yourselves at home.  kim, i'm in agony here.  your back hurts that bad.  this is the only thing that helps.  i'm sorry.  maybe i overreacted.  when i first walked in, i just assumed you were taking advantage.  just so you know, the steam room's out of eucalyptus.  hey, kim.  if you're gonna get in the hot tub with us, we got one rule.  what happens at the weinsteins' house stays at the weinsteins' house.  so, don, i bet you've got a lot of great stories about fishing.  yep, yep, yep.  feel like sharing any of them.  you know what a 7inch auger is, greg.  no.  then no.  so, that's a nice fishing pole.  oh, yeah, it's homemade.  you made it.  no, my grandfather.  he made it )
