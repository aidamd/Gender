on the witness.  now, miss turtle, were you in the cafeteria when the defendant announced he was planning a prank.  he was looking for volunteers to help him get miss bliss.  and yesterday, just before the crime, did you see anything suspicious.  yes.  well, will you tell us what you saw.  i saw a person stash a can in their locker.  your honor, it was awful.  tell us, is that person you saw in the courtroom today.  yes. it was that man.  he's the one. i'd never forget his face.  no further questions, your honor.  defense attorney, you may crossexamine the witness.  lisa, i notice you're wearing a bandaid on your finger.  what happened.  i broke a nail.  oh, my.  no doubt a very traumatic experience.  the most. i was embarrassed to wave to anyone.  you mean you were under such stress you couldn't think.  were you angry, upset, confused.  yes. no.  i don't know.  oh, great, i broke another nail.  this is awful.  can she be restrained for her own protection.  bailiff, keep your distance.  what's going on here.  i'm trying to cheer up mr. belding.  happy harvest week depresses him.  and what's that.  ..helium tank.  see, see, that's an uhuh.  see, our union contract, rule
