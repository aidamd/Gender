" i think that would take a whole orchard.  class, today we're going to talk about subliminal advertising.  what's that.  it's advertising that uses hidden messages.  i pass those to girls every day.  and every day, we flush them.  theater owners use hidden messages by flashing a picture of popcorn during a movie.  does it work.  well, sales really started popping.  would i buy something because of some hidden message.  you all did.  that lovely music tape i played yesterday contained hidden messages requesting flowers, candy, and apples.  that's ridiculous.  what do you take us for, mindless robots.  nevnever, screech.  how's that done.  it's simple. gather around.  listen closely to the tape i played yesterday.   you'll hear messages when i take out the music and turn up the voice track.  bring your favorite teacher miss wentworth apples and candy.  she loves beautiful flowers.  for a handsome single parent, i'm available.  bring your favorite teacher miss wentworth apples and candy.  amazing. does it always work.  it's usually effective a few hours.  it doesn't work on everyone, and some minds get the messages mixed up.  what if belding discovers his tape's got hidden messages.  he won't. they're hidden.  it's my only hope to keep belding from my mother.  she'll never fall for belding.  she loves your father.  if belding meets my mother, i'll be grounded.  ok. is everything set up.  yep. california girls tape is here.  i'll record your voice and mix them.  where's the microphone.  it's hidden.  ok. get ready to record my voice.  zack brainwashing belding.  take one.

smart, and funny.  yes, that's zack morris.  what's going on.  we each had dates.  now we're fighting over zack.  something weird's happening, like bayside's been brainwashed.  someone's been playing with our minds.  wait a second.  miss wentworth's class.  subliminal advertising.  i wonder if someone's using hidden messages on us.  not my screechy.  he's the buffest bronco on earth.  wait. what am i saying.  zack. zack.  using this tape.  they weren't out of our hands.  except during soccer practice.  there was this strange little girl in the locker room.  we saw her.  think about it, ok.

himself.  he brainwashed me.  i was mean to slater.  i dumped him.  i begged screech to be my sweetheart.  i'll be in counseling the rest of my life.  zack took advantage to be the most popular boy.
