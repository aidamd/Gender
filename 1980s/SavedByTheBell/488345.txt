wheelchair's no fun at parades, but great in supermarkets.  why didn't you tell me you were in a wheelchair.  would you believe i forgot.  no.  most people get so freaked out about it.  they never stop thinking about the chair.  i wanted you to meet me first.  look, i'm sorry i stared.  it was a surprise.  if you want to leave, i'll understand.  i'll wheel over your toe, but i'll understand.  no, i'm not leaving.  i like surprises.  i reserved a booth over there.  i'll get your coke.  in here.  ..  there. much better.  ..may i ask how it happened.  i was born this way.  my dad calls it

nutcase.  i told youno calls.  i'm shy around boys, because i'm so tall.  well, uh, maybe if you wait a couple years, the rest of us will catch up.  wish i could just shrink.  may i say something.  sure.  i know what it's like to be different.  you'd be liked more if you like yourself more.  stop looking at being tall as a problem.  think of tall as beautiful.  the rest will fall into place.  thanks a lot.  well, now, that is pretty impressive, huh, slater.  eh, not really.  my cousin julie's 6'7", barefoot.  no, dummy.  i meant what melissa just did for kathy.  even though she's handicapped, she gave kathy perfect advice.  zack, my mind's not handicapped.  i'll say, you're incredible.  go out with me tonight.  no's not an answer.  sure. i'll turn the clocks back four hours.

young woman's handicapped, and someone has illegally parked in the handicapped space.  i'm sorry. i'll call the police.  it's not that important.  i also noticed that you have no wheelchair access to your rest rooms.  we're in the midst of renovating.  why does she have to pay full price.  she doesn't use your seats.  everyone pays to see the movie.  she can place her wheelchair right here.  thank you.  the problem is that people just don't care about other people, especially disabled people.  the movie's about to start.  let's not make this whole day about my disability.  just getting a few things off my mind.  good. let's enjoy the movie.  comfortable.  yes. i'm o.k.  popcorn, sodanothing.  sir, would you mind slumping down.  my date's in a wheelchair.  has anyone seen tommy.  no,
