spirit, son.  i need a miracle.  morris, let us dispense with the formalities.  pay up now.  like that dork's never going to win.  .  o.k.  hey, peter, where you going.  i go to humiliate your friend screechni.  hey, pete, that's great, but you have to get a pregame photo taken.  oh, yes.  oh, yes.  it's an american custom.  if you lose, they have a picture of you smiling.  come on.  it's right

your cryin', stop your fussin'    come on, screech, beat that russian   whoo. whoo. whoo.  and they're off.  the soviet gets the first move.  pawn to king's rook two.  that's an unorthodox style.

russian was winning, then the russian was losing, now the russian's hopping on stage in his underwear.  quite a game, huh.  that's not peter. that's some faker.  well, let's find out who the faker is.  ow.  ow.  morris, you'd better have an amazing explanation for this.  we made this teeny bet with valleybut they stole screech's lucky hat so hse.  we did it for bayside.  hats. kidnapping. gambling.  that's it.  both schools are disqualified for unsportsmanlike conduct.  you can't do that.  these guys were innocent pawns.  screech and the commie knew nothing about this.  they didn't.  i don't know.  if we canceled the bet, could they play.   all right, but only if you call it off.  guys, the bet's off, all right.  everybody happy.   why not. what do you want.  it is cold. i want my pants back.  wait a minute. the bet's off.  then you're broke. i'm out of here.  all right. hey. whoo.  hey, i still want to see you and slater in my office tomorrow morning.  forget it, guys.  without my lucky beret, i have nothing left.  you have me, samuel.  violet. i thought you hated me.  that was before i realized you were manipulated by powerful forces and you couldn't help yourself.  i love you, sammy.  i love you, too, violet.  now, let's play some chess.  yay. whoo. all right. yay.  checkmate.  yay. yeah. whoo.  all right, screech.  i didn't win the bet, but i've got the new cereal of
