 it's on the house for making the team.  hey, make a wish.  i wish we'd beat valley.  whoo. yeah.  can i have the candle.  you want to lick the icing.  no. i love to chew wax.  he was raised by wolves.  this looks delicious.  too bad you can't eat it. you're training.  you're right. here, zack.  i wouldn't be on the team without you.  thanks. we got to go to the radio station.  zack, are you going to eat that wrapper.  no. why.  well, after eating wax, there's nothing like a good wrapper to wash it down.  get out of here.  jessie, thanks for helping me.  i just stood up for what i believed in.  ah, she's a cute little feminist, isn't she.  you're on thin ice, bubba.  don't you ever go off duty, girl.  that was a great move you put on rodriguez.  where'd you learn it.  you. you used it on nidik last year.  you saw me.  you were awesome.  this year, you are going to be state champion.  hey, how about that, mama.  isn't that great.  oh, golly, yes.  would you mind showing me your best hold sometime.  i'm not busy.  do you mind, jessie.  no, jessie doesn't mind.  she's your biggest supporter.  let's go hit the mats.  yeah.  hey, where did everybody go.  jessie doesn't care to discuss it.  this is zack morris broadcasting live from a place where no guy has gone before.  where.  aah.  you guessed it.  i'm in the girls' locker room.  i'm in noman's land to interview bayside's newest and cutest wrestler kristy barnes.  you'll get in trouble.  no risk is too great to capture the athlete in her natural habitat.  you're nuts.  kristy, what's it like being the only girl on the wrestling team.  it's fun. the guys are nice to me.  probably because i can pin most of them.  get out.  not until we get personal.  every guy at bayside wants to know one thing.  what's that.  what kind of guy does kristy barnes like.  oh. i don't know.  perhaps the kind of guy who would sneak into a girls' locker room.  maybe. i got to hit the showers.  we'll do the interview there.  oh, no, we won't.  this is zack morris reporting live from the promised land.  would you like to go to the movies tonight.  yeah, i'd love to.  how about at 7:30.  yeah, ok.  zack morris.  i know you're in here.  and if i catch you in here, ..  ..  suspended.  where are you, morris.  morris.  morris.  ..  got you.  aah. aah.  that principal in the girls' locker room will remain nameless.  now, i've saved the juiciest item for last.  where does lisa get this.  she knew about my zit at the game.  what hunk and lady wrestler are putting the moves on each other outside the gym.  they're flipping over each other.  they can't be.  she wouldn't say it if it wasn't true.  i never lie. i saw them with my own eyes.  you're sure.  this is a match made in heaven.  you're lying.  .. but not my best friend.  actually, i hardly even know her.  i'm still having trouble with those escape holds you were showing me.  ok.  they're not too hard.  let's try the fullnelson escape first.  put me in one.  ..  too cool.  all right. now you try it.  whoa. that was pretty good, kristy.  you worked on a full nelson and a half nelson.  show her the willie nelson.  that's a country wrestling joke.   i got spurs that jingle jangle jingle   can i try the reverse bearhug escape.  yeah, sure.  now, i want to get this right.  ok.  good. just hold me tighter.  wow. you're really strong.  aah.  i loved the movie.  yeah.  it was so romantic.  wasn't michelle pfeiffer beautiful.  compared to you, she was a bowwow.  come on.  i mean it. you look so great tonight.  ..girl.  i am a girl.  i was watching you more than the movie.  well, look who's here.  if it's not bayside's big, bad lady wrestler.  listen, leave us alone. we're on a date.  shut up, or i'll twist you into a pretzel.  i don't want any trouble.  why don't you go back to valley and find your brain.  what's your problem. are you nuts.  are you going to leave us alone.  no.  oh. ouch. ok.  we won't just beat you, we're going to murder you.  beat it.  are you ok, zack.  uh, yeah, i guess.  wow, kristy, you're one very strong woman.  it's lucky for you she was here, huh, morris.  uh, yeah. lucky me.  mmmmm...  when you add velveeta to spicy rotel tomatoes and green chiles, you've got a queso so good, it'll blow 'em away.  man, that's good.  velveeta & rotel.  bertolli.  what has italian chefs throwing a fit.  bertolli.  people are staying home more than ever for ..  like mediterranean style chicken rigatoni and broccoli.  ..  to make tonighta bertolli night.  had ] he sure is working up an appetite up there.  how about some hamburger helper.  ..  how 'bout some after the show.  hamburger helper.  one pound.one pan. one tasty meal.  to him.  under.   ..or over.  tell us how you roll at cottonellerollpoll.com.   kkty bayside   this is jessica spano forspano speaks.  recently i gave an editorial supporting a girl's right to wrestle on a guys' team.  boy, was i ever wrong.  girls have absolutely no business wrestling guys.  the poor dears could get hurt.  so in conclusion, keep your hands off our men, kristy.  what was that all about.  i thought you were all for kristy.  i know you are.  what's that supposed to mean.  " that's what this is all about.  you're jealous.  come on, i was just helping a teammate.  when was the last time you held rodriguez like that.  why would i want a girl like kristy when i can have a nutcake like you.  don't try flattering me.  it won't get you anywhere.  men.  chicks.  jessie was my biggest supporter.  why would she say those things.  maybe she's having a bad day.  her hair's too tight.  she shouldn't wear berets while the moon is full.  what. what.  it's the gravitational pull on the follicles.  she's a helpless victim of nature.  hi, kristy.  zack, i'm so glad you're here.  i can't go to the movies with you tonight.  ..study.  study. study.  hmm, another casualty of the moon.  i better get home before it gets dark.  ok, zack.  why don't we just go to the movies tomorrow night.  kristy, it isn't that.  i don't think we should see each other anymore.  it's not working out between us.  does this have anything to do with what happened on our date.  ..  what a great day.  first jessie wants me off the wrestling team, and now you can't handle going out with a girl wrestler.  well, i'm going to make you both happy.  i'm quitting the team.  i'd feel the same even if she wasn't trying to wrestle my man away.  your man. kristy likes me.  i could see right through it.  i knew she liked slater.  oh, jessie, read my lips.  kristy likes me, not slater.  lisa said kristy was going out with a hunk.  what do i look like, a baloney sandwich.  oops. what have i done.  yeah. what havewedone.  i was a jealous, possessive fool.  and i was a fool, too. as usual.  well, we blew it.  look, we can't let her quit the team.  i'll talk to her.  no, you've talked enough.  i'll talk to her.  i just hope she doesn't bodyslam me.  leave me alone, zack.  look, i told you, i don't want to talk to you.  then i'm coming in.  if belding catches you, you're going to get suspended.  i have to talk to you.  it's a free country. talk.  kristy, this isn't easy for me to say, but i was embarrassed when you wouldn't let me fight the guy.  so.  a guy should protect the girl.  i couldn't handle it when you protected me.  i didn't mean to embarrass you.  i know that. you love wrestling.  don't quit the team over a jerk like me.  do you really mean it.  jerk's honor.  will you ever forgive me.  on one conditiontake me to the movies tomorrow night.  i'd be afraid not to.  ok, sports fans, this should be a great contest.  briggs and slater are both undefeated.  and they've never lost, either, zack.  ready, ok.  here comes slater, he's got guts.  slam their bellies, kick their butts.  this promises to be a long, grueling match.  wrestlers, ready.    slater wins in record time.  bayside and valley are tied 3 matches apiece with 1 to go.  the tension is mounting.  this match will determine the winner of the meet.  will it be valley skipper skolnik or bayside's first female wrestler kristy barnes.  i think so, zack.  it's up to you now.  if you get into trouble, just remember what i taught you, ok.  hey, look, kristy, i'm sorry.  i was wrong about you.  and you, too.  it's ok, mama. i'm used to you by now.  all right, all right. here we go.  ..  tigers. tigers.  ..  take your places.  ..  ready.   skolnik and barnes circle each other.  oh, no.  now skolnik has barnes in a full nelson.  come on, kristy, you can do it.  bite him, kristy.  yeah, yeah.  skolnik is forcing kristy to the mat.  do something.  use the hold you used at the max.   yeah.  all right.  kristy, kristy, how does it feel to make league history.  great.  oh.  well, ladies and gentlemen, that was kristy barnes, our new star wrestler and also my date for tonight.  if anybody has a problem with that, she'll beat you up.  captioning performed bythe national captioning institute, inc.
