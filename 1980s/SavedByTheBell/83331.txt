 like the sun.  the sun's our competitor, and we're in the oil business.  that's a good one.  i'm serious.  i know you are, and please excuse my joke.  we are exploring alternatives, like wind and solar power, but until these technologies become costefficient, oil's still our best energy source.  we want a bigger gym and a cheerleader in every locker.  you know, i never had a pet before.  it's been fun having becky here.  probably because it's the only girl your mom will let sleep over.   " oh, hi, you cute little thing.  oh, you're pretty cute yourself, mama.  zack, sign this petition to stop the oil drilling.  stop it. be serious.  it's the best thing that's happened at bayside.  besides putting the periscope in the girls' locker room.  that was you.  zack was skipper, and i was gilligan.  you look great in a towel.  now drop it.  zack, i need your signature.  how many signatures do you have.  ..one.  " oh, i know her.  that's me, dopus.  i don't agree with you on this.  this oil will benefit everyone in the school.  at least read the research i dug up.  you're digging up in the library.  the oil's under the football field.  quiet, little weird man.  zack, oil can do a lot of environmental damage.  please read it.  ok.  i'll never forget how you looked in that towel, babe.  zack, i think jessie has the hots for me.  yeah. it's obvious to everyone.  well, it's late. let's call it a night.  well, it's bedtime, becky.  can i read her a story.  the ugly duckling orduck tales.  get out of here.  good night, becky, and remember donald says that to huey, dewey, and louie.  and you're screwy. good night.  i know i shouldn't say this, but i wish i didn't have to take you to the pond tomorrow.  whoa. you going to miss me.   aw, don't worry about it.  i'll come visit you all the time.  did you read that information on oil.  not yet. i'll read it tonight.  i promise.  doesn't anybody feel the way i feel.  i do about kevin costner, but not oil.  it'll give us a great school.  what about you, kelly.  well, i care about the environment but also like zack's idea about hot tubs in class.  i was kidding.  me, too.  kelly, oil causes pollution.  take a stand.  leave her alone, jessie.  oil also runs cars, heats homes, and makes plastic earrings like yours.  actually, um, i borrowed these, right, lisa.  you're on your own.  that fashion statement i wouldn't make.   everybody, today we leave the classroom and return our animals to their homes in the wild.  oh, that's so sad.  i'd like to return dorks to the wild.  where's my turtle.  oh, here he is.  oh, i'm going to miss you, little fellow.  you're slimy but sweet.  ..  here are your frogs, and, slater, your salamander, sir.  oh.  and, kelly, here's your crayfish.  ooh. hee hee.  zack, you got becky.  don't worry about her.   that's the oil company disturbing our environment.  no. it's just a 2ton woodpecker.  maybe jessie's right. i don't like this.  they're drilling a test well.  can't make an omelet without breaking some eggs.  it's just the beginning of beautiful bayside.  class, forget about the noise.  let's get our animals back to the pond.  ok. come on, becky.  go ahead.  stop the drilling. stop the oil.  what are you doing.  protesting for what we believe.  one man here has enough guts to join us.  franklin.  yeah, franklin.  i just wanted to be chained to the head cheerleader and the school president.  it's everything i dreamed it would be.  don't touch me.  ever tried nerd love.  i'm going to be sick.  jessie, you're being an alarmist.  you look foolish.  stop the drilling. stop the oil.  stop the drilling. stop the oil.  stop the shouting. give me a kiss.  what's going on here.  does this have something to do with the oil.  you're sharp, mr. belding.  we got to get ready for gym class.  stop the drilling. stop the oil.  i'm ordering you to stop this protest immediately.  not on your lifei mean, if that's ok.  come to my office.  we're not going anywhere.  well, if you don't, you're suspended.  we're coming to your office.  guess we've lost.  franklin, give me the key.  he swallowed it.

them.  oh, no, zack.  i've caught them looking at me and whispering with delight.  i'll show them more than they can handle.  if any faint, i'll wake them with my kisses.  that will kill them.  hey, slater, what happened to you.  you didn't hear about the oil spill.  no.  they were drilling, suddenly oil started spilling everywhere.  into the pond.  hey, i don't know.  beckythe animalswe just put them back.  come on. we got to save them.  dr. phelps, we need your help.  what is it, zack.  there's been an oil spill.  look what happened to becky.  please, becky, it's ok.  the poor thing.  please, sir, show us how to clean her off.  she's not moving, zack.  please help us, sir.  ..  zack, becky's dead.  pleasescreech, let's clean her off.  it's no use, zack.  i don't believe that.  zack, it's too late.  you guys, i heard about the pond.  zack, i'm so sorry.  this is terrible.  i should have listened to you, jessie.  i'm sorry, becky.  it wasn't your fault.  don't worry about becky, zack.  she's where the oil can't hurt her now.  i feel bad, too.  i loved going to the pond and feeding becky, but accidents happen.  accidents happen a lot with oil companies.  then they deny being responsible.  it's not that simple. progress has a price.  people died in the space program, but should we stop exploring the universe.  sir, we've got to do something.  we've got to stop the drilling.  zack, you wanted a better bayside more than anyone.  sir, i was wrong.  please, you've got to do something.  what can i do.  what. you're the principal.  aren't you man enough to scare anyone but the kids.  oops.  mr. belding, becky is dead.  the pond is polluted.  who knows what's going to happen next.  we got there too late.  there's nothing we can do.  all our animals are dead.  belding, we can't let these animals die for nothing.  you've got to tell the school board to stop the drilling.  i'll try, but i'm afraid it'll take more than a few dead animals to change their minds.  as you can see, the new gymnasium will house a separate boys and girls basketball court.  that may bother you boys who love sharing a court with girls in gym shorts.  over here we have a modern, olympicsize swimming pool that will make shamu jealous.  sir, where's the football field.  that will be constructed where the swampy area now exists.  you're going to fill the pond.  that pond's part of bayside.  well, we're drilling mostly over the old fieldbut as the model shows, we're not just taking something away.  we're putting more back in.  what's this new campus going to cost in taxes.  i'm glad you asked that.  calstar and the school board will be partners in building this.  it will cost you nothing.  that's not true.  what do you mean.  sir, may i have the floor.  you got it, zack.  ladies and gentlemen, i may only be a high school kid, but i've already learned you never get something for nothing.  everything has its price.  grayson, this is a very beautiful model, but where are the oak trees, where we would have lunch.  you'll have lunch in your brandnew cafeteria.  where are the trees.  i'm afraid we'll have to replace them.  with an oil derrick.  but that's not on the model.  of course there will be derricks.  sort of like this.  when we're having classes in this building here and look out the window, are we going to see one of these.  guess they were left off by mistake.  where are the trees where we had classes when it got hot.  the whole school will be airconditioned.  right. who needs trees.  what are you saying, young man.  i'm saying calstar oil is right.  they're not taking something out of the ground.  they're helping put a lot more back in.  jessie.  yesterday, because of your oil spill, we put 20 dead animals back into the ground.  we're sorry about that.  it was an accident. we cleaned it up.  but can you guarantee it won't happen again.  there are no guaranteesbut what if there's a bigger accident, and oil gets over everything like this.  young man, this is outrageous.  look at this.  i'm covered with oil.  well, it was an accident, sir.  at least you'll live.  see, sir, i wanted a bigger and better bayside more than anybodyeven more than youbut we don't want to pay that price.  we don't want to go to school in an oil field.  i think we know how we should vote.  mr. grayson, thank you for coming.  we already have a better bayside.  we just didn't know it until now.  captioning performed bythe national captioning institute, inc.  doing, trying to be big like you, dad.  you're so good at keeping everyone full and focused
