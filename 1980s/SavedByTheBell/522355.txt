wings and said he was cupid.  he looked like an abandoned dork stork.  maybe he's finally going to leave you alone all year.  i'm your living valentine, my darling.  there goes that theory.  what do you think.  you should get a heart transplant.  that's, uh, pretty cool, screech.  thanks, screech.  this is the kind of kiss from you i like.  want to try the real thing.  want a fist in the stomach.  some of us have been chasing our dream girls for years.  ah.  kelly kapowski.  kelly.  hi, zack.  so, kel, big dance friday night, huh.  i haven't asked anyone yet.  well, my calendar's clear, if you know what i mean.  you want me to ask you.  you could do worse.  and better.  a lot better.  sometimes you need an edge, and sometimes it goes wrong.  i'm glad i found you.  i have to talk to you.  oh. i wonder what's up.  i don't want to go to the dance with slater.  what.  listen. it gets better.  i suddenly realized how much i care for you, zack.  please rescue me from this musclebound

feeling of catching her.  i'll never forget our prom night together.  zack, will you dance with me.  sure.  i don't know how to thank you for tonight.  we're together.  that's enough.  remember when you asked me to the prom.  asked. you were desperate to go with me.  me, desperate.  i'm glad you agree, but you were afraid to commit.  youwere.  hey, um, you, uh, have a date for the prom.  ..no,

same thing.  shelters are for good pets that want to be adopted.  jails are for criminals.  i've done nothinguhoh.  okay, i stole a cheeseburger once.  i'm a dog.   screech, where's your heart.  i couldn't get it back on in the bathroom.  some nerds are fighting over it.  fighting is a part of love.  the best part is making up.  when doweget to kiss and make up.  when it rains carrot juice in burbank.  i'll check the weather report.  we'll never make up because we were never together.  remember, my precious.  i'm making my move.  screech, love and science don't mix.  did you ever see einstein with a chick.  no, zack. kelly's right.  this is my one moment in time.   ..  be my partner, and this could be you.  so pick you up 7:00ish.  now that kelly's picked zack, you'd better snatch

up, you can't even think straight, as jessie and slater just demonstrated.  breaking up really hurts, too.  and sometimes it happens faster than you realize.  i've planned our entire saturday evening.  yeah. so have i. you first.  we begin with a romantic dinner at cafe diane and then on to the ballet.  ballet.  you know how hard it was to get these l.a. raider tickets.  there's nothing romantic about a bunch of barbarians kicking each other's butts.  well, what's romantic about a guy in pink tights tiptoeing around, pretending to be a swan.  i should've known better than to go steady with a sexist pig.  if you don't like it, go steady with some other pig.  maybe i will.  goodbye.  can you believe her.  ..  good morning, zack.  no matter how hard you try, you'll never forget me.  yeah. i
