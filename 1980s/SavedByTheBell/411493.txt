once you see how lovely the dining room's decorated, you'll be happy with the change.  jessie, these old folks move like molasses.  zack says to stall.  this is the biggest night in a girl'life.  i remember my sweet 16 party.  it was last year.  that's nice, but i'm ready for my party.  jenny, don't be in such a hurry to grow up.  you want your sweet 16, but once it's over, then what.  16 and one day isn't quite as sweet.  where does the time go.  what are you babbling about.  the party's in here.  ..  hey.  all right.  why are these people here.  ..  well, they'rethey're complimentary chaperons.  no extra charge.  what are these teenagers doing here.  ..they're here to remind you to stay forever young, no matter how old you are.  i got the coats.  let's herd the thornhills out before the richters see them.  forget it, screech. it's over.  everyone, i have a confession to make.  the club goofed and booked two parties here.  i'm really very sorry.  the parties are a disaster.  not necessarily.  these people came for a good time.  let's give them one.  how.  ask mr. thornhill to dance.  come on.  go.  thornhill, would you care to tango with me.  that looks like a neat dance.  like to try it.  mrs. thornhill, will you do me the honor.  mr. richter, may i have this dance.  i'm still not sure what's going on here, but yes, all right.  mr. carosi, please don't go in there.  the thornhill party and the richter party going on at the same time.  daddy.  how did this mess happen.  the dining room was doublebooked.  who's the idiot who doublebooked the room.  that's easy. you are.  do the members realize that.  well, carosi, you're back.  i'm sorry this happened while i was away.  you should go away more often.  this is becoming one heck of a party.  young lady, you've done a terrific job.  that's why i left her in charge.  stacy, this entitles you to a raise.  i'll only accept it under one conditionyou give the kitchen staff a raise, too.  mmmmmm.  mmhmm.  why should i do that.  because you already promised it to them.  and they cooked for both parties.  o.k. they get a raise.  now i'll take a walk on the beach and have a good cry.  i hate giving up money.  that was nice what you did for the staff.  that was nice, you saving my neck.  you're the man with the million ideas.  yeah. here's another one.  e.  stacy.  ..  walk on the beach.  the holes.

advantages.  i know where the chef hides the good stuff.  i'm looking at the good stuff.  stacy.  yes, zack.  i want you to know that i loveyes.  i love the way you butter bread.  well, this is margarine, but thanks anyway.  you know, if someone told me we'd end up together, i'd have laughed in their face.  i thought you were an uptight, spoiled, eastern snob.  and those were your good qualities.  i thought you were just a lazy, gnarly, scheming california dude.  well, i'm glad i was wrong.  how about you.  ..  ..  but i like you anyway.  ..  i like you, too.  a lot.  what's your

i tell a girl i love her, she clobbers me.  girls like guys to say how beautiful their eyes are, how soft their hair isromantic junk.  i know.  but don't tell them at a video arcade.  go someplace romantic, then it's smooth sailing after that.  tonight i'll take stacy to paradise cove.  i'll tell her right there.  i found jill playing too close to the water.  kelly, thank you.  if there's
