way .  . to get the best price .  . to stop chasing sales .  . when i'd rather be .  . having story time by the tree .   this christmas, you don't have to chase sales.  walmart checks other stores'prices so you don't have to and if there's a betteradvertised price out there, they'll even match it.  christmas costs less at walmart.  save money.live better.  walmart.  @@ robin, can i take
