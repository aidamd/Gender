hi, jessie.  you're not working out.  i'm studying for your test.  there won't be one.  zack's doing away with tests.  he wants learning to be fun.  zack's idea of a good education is sitting between a pretty girl and a smart nerd.  no. he's changed.  did you hit your head on a pom pom again.  hey, jessie, kelly.  a.c.  hey, hey, fellas.  hoo. hoo. hoooo.  hoo. hoo. hoo. hoo.  they should be caged and given bananas.  slater, i have good news.  the test is off.  i knew zack could do it.  do what.  uh, nothing.  nothing. zack got teach to cancel that test.  shut up.  well, this cheerleader says this test is on on.  but, kelly, i didn't study.  if we take that test, we'll flink.  that's flunk, ox.  i guess the football players aren't coming.  at least you're here.  if they don't have to take the test, why should we.  because you care more about education than they do.  nerd men. nerd men.  deep down, we like to party.  hey, wait for us.  nerds are better than nothing.  i don't believe this.  well, i'm glad that you're responsible.  thanks for staying, jessie.  who says i'm staying.  what.  but you're our class president.  i'm not taking your stupid test alone.  if i panic, i'll get a low grade, and there'll be no curve to pull me up.  see you, sister.  has there been a bomb scare.  the football players cut a test, so everyone else ditched, too.  you lost control of your class.  that reflects on the teacher as much as the students.  you're the principal.  tuttle to get out of detention.  zack's the principal now.  can't you do something.  no, but you can.  a good teacher can always find a way to get through to anyone.  well, got to go.  i don't have a hall pass.  kelly.  take school more seriously, slater.  who do you think you are.  your teacher.  you're not a real teacher.  what's going on here.  the football players purposely cut class to miss my test.  what are you going to do.  i'm going to take stern action.  you're on probation for violating my notest policy.  you have let me down.  i've let you down.  you're taking this teacher thing way too seriously.  i'm the only one who is.  this is important to me.  listen, kelly.  i work hard, too.  i got to classes and practice till dark, then i study from 12:00 or 1:00.  why. because everyone wants us to beat valley.  i deserve a break.  good point. chip.  thank you.  everyone walks out, and i'm known as kelly kapowksi, the girl with no class.  why should i be a loser so you can be a winner.  good point, too.  don't let them get away with this.  i bet a lot on this game.  and i bet a lot on youas a boyfriend, then as a friend, and now as a principal.  i always thought you were special.  i guess i lost that bet.  you're still special to me, zack.  really special.  can't we work out a compromise here.  no. no.  you're both my friends.  what do i do.  do the right thing.  if you remember what that is.  you wanted to see me, principal morris.  it wasn't me who put jello in the swimming pool.  no. that's not it.  i'm quitting.  i don't want to be principal.  i'm having fun being a student.  we're planning on mooning the crossing guard after school.  stop it.  stop acting like zack morris.  well, yeah.  no way.  ouch.  i'm out of here.  no, you're not.  the purpose of this project is to learn responsibility.  you'll stick with it until you do.  no matter what i do, i'll lose a friend.
