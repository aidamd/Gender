congratulations.  thanks. have you been rushed yet.  my mother was in kappa theta, so i'm a legacy there.  which means they have to take me whether they want to or not.  i'd die to be a kappa theta.  the beta deltas and kappa thetas are rival sororities.  ooh, really.  it goes back 80 years when the betas kidnapped the thetas' homecoming queeneleanor roosevelt.  come on.  and they've been fighting ever since.  and just last week, the thetas put super glue on the betas' toilet seats.  that was them.  i was visiting that day.  and i didn't think that it was funny.  oh, come on. it was just a joke.  i mean, let's not let getting into different sororities affect our friendship.  oh, ok.  ok.  oh, and just a bit of friendly advicei really wouldn't wear that outfit to my open house.  well, if i was going to theta house, then i would dress like margaret thatcher.  well, excuse me for not looking like the b52's.  ..  just keep your hands off my toilet seat.  you know, i was thinking, slater, you ought to put in a good word for me with rick and the other fraternity guys.  well, i don't know what to tell them.  .. honest...  and that i'm cindy crawford's new cohost on house of style.  hey,

good time.  anytime's a good time for balloon animals.  besides, i figured the next time we have a party, they can come in handy.  no.  get those things out of here.  what's the matter. you don't like mr. giraffeywaffey.  i can make a rhinoceros or a hippo orno.  you killed him.  who is that guy.  that guy. just a guy in our dorm.  yeah. he lives down the hall.  uhhuh.  way down the hall.  someone, anyone, yell out a farm animal.  some other time.  you ought to be ashamed of yourself, slater.  it's just a fraternity party.  you don't want to be seen with screech, either.  i'm not the one who tried to sign him up for the semester at sea program.  no, you're the one who wanted to exchange him for that student from pakistan.  if she loses her mustache, she's a babe.  i can't believe this.  what's so great about being in a fraternity.  it's just a bunch of guys sitting around watching beavis and butthead and burping.  and. and.  and is it worth turning your back on screech.  i thought he was your friend.  ..yeah... i mean, he is.  i like screech.  yeah.  i like him, too.  well, then again, i like the three stooges, but i wouldn't want to go to a fraternity party with them.  well, maybe larry.  yeah. maybe larry.  .. ohhh...  wise guy.  listen, screech has been making a fool out of me since kindergarten.  because of him, i didn't get in the cool nap group.  you have known him longer.  technically, that makes him more your friend, so you should be the one to tell him he's not coming with us.  no, no, no. he's just as much your friend.  no, he's really more your friend the way you guys are talking, he seems more like my friend.  well, great. you tell him.  yeah.  ..  ..  i'm not going to tell him. you tell him.  hey, dad, isn't it great.  i'm going to be in a fraternity.  no, not a geek frat. it's a really cool one.  zack and slater are going to be my brothers.  this is the greatest thing that's ever happened to me.  pete.  yeah, it's me, big brother.  put the remote down and listen.  this intervention brought to you by niaspan.  so you cut back on the cheeseburgers and stopped using your exercise bike as a coat rack.  that's it.  you're done.  i don't think so.  you told me your doctor's worried about plaque clogging your arteries what did he call it...coronary artery disease.  that cholesterol medicine he also wants you on niaspan.  i looked it up online.  hey, pete, you waiting for an engraved invitation.  if you have high cholesterol and coronary artery disease, and diet and exercise are not enough, niaspan, along with diet and a bile acidbinding resin, is fdaapproved not only to slow down plaque buildup but to actually help clear some of it away.  pete, as kids, i always looked up to you.  now, i'm just trying to look after you.  if you cannot afford your medication, call 1877niaspan.  niaspan is not for everyone, like people with stomach ulcers, liver, or serious bleeding problems.  severe liver damage can occur when switching to niaspan from immediaterelease niacin.  blood tests are needed to check for liver problems.  tell your doctor if you have muscle pain or weakness. this could be a sign of serious side effects. this risk can increase with statin use.  tell your doctor about alcohol use, if you've ever had gout, or are diabetic and experience increases in blood sugar.  flushing, a common side effect, is warmth, redness, itching, or tingling of the skin.  ask your doctor about niaspan.  fight back.  fight plaque.  niaspan.  hey, screech.  oh, hi, guys.  ..about this fraternity party tonight...  oh,
