 yeah, all of them.  they died hundreds of years ago.  it's so sad.  zack, what about yourncncestors adam and eve.  i didn't know adam and eve's last name warris.  looks like my aunt hannah, except she had thicker sideburns.  my mom told me stories about a distant indian relative.  my mom tells me stories about foureyed monsters hiding in my closet.  she should see a doctor, zack.  they're not there.  i bet this indian's my ancestor.  it's perfect for my family tree presentation.  you could help me.  how.  that's a good start.  after abraham escaped from slavery, he became a conductor in the underground railroad.  they had subways during the civil war.  under the cloak of darkness, he helped sneak other slavescalled passengersto freedom along this route from atlanta to new york.  my family calls this underground railroad the original soul train.  discovering pride in our background is what this assignment's about.  abraham would be proud of you.  " jessie, let's hear from you next.  yes.  my ancestors were seafaring people.  they sailed on ships. thank you. i'm finished.  perhaps you could tell us more.  they shipped tea, spices, people, lumber, that stuff.  people.  my ancestors shipped black peopleslaves.  they were slave traders.  can you forgive me. i'm so ashamed.  you didn't do anything.  unleash those centuries of repressed anger.  you're being silly.  more. i'll take it.  you can sit down.  now you hate me.  i see it in your voice.  i'm losing it.  calm down, jessie.  we all have unpleasant things in our past.  we can learn from the mistakes of jessie's forefathers.  jessie had four fathers.  that's four allowances.  zack morris, you're next.  screech will assist me. ready, screech.  ready,kemo sabe.  after digging

zack should get an extension on his project.  i don't.  glad you see it my wayyou don't.  zack has to learn responsibility.  if he doesn't finish his project by friday, " aw, gee, miss wentworth, that's not fair.  he's had 30 days. it's still not done.  is that true, zack.  technically, but only if you count weekends.  see. it's a technicality.  zack's bayside's only hope to win.  the better win for zack is a solid education.  i'm sorry. no project, no track meet.  we all want to stay active.  we don't wantanything...  ...to slow us down.  but even inyour 30s...  ...your bones canbegin to

was brave.  what was his name.  like the wind, his presence was strongly felt, but seldom heard.  your people ran, too, but not for trophies.  they ran to preserve their way of life, which became harder when more of them got killed.  why couldn't the white man and the indians get along.  why can't lions get along with zebras or arabs with israelis.  why can't i get along with my exwife.  come

debonair italian lover and spy.  women worldwide found him irresistible.  i'll demonstrate his charm.  buon giorno,baby.  arrivederci, dorky.  the paorelli technique became legendary.  women could not control themselves.  behold.  signorina, i love you madly.  get lost.  i'll leave a trail of bread crumbs so you can find me, eh.  mille grazie, screech.  and thank you, my little pizza pie.  screech,

"my people have no food.  ..is sad.
