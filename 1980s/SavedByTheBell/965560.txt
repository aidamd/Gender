all right.  swimsuit.  swimsuit.  swimsuit. swimsuit.  the winner will then go on to compete for the title of miss high school california.  a beauty pageant.  what a stupid, sexist waste of time.  not if you're in a teeny bikini.  a woman sits on the supreme court, yet belding wants us in bathing suits.  don't those women swim in bathing suits.  ooh. counter that.  kelly, i don't want to be judged on my measurements.  you got some great ones.  yeah.  we're going backwards in our war against sexism.  you can take me prisoner anytime.  jessie does have a point.  after listening to you, i'm not entering.  this will be some beauty pageant.  why don't we form a picket line.  not me. i'm entering.  i want to be miss high school california.  it's fun being pretty.  let's make picket signs.  how about some with pink letters and cute hearts.  see ya.  bye.  lisa, you're one lucky girl.  with kelly gone, i'm supporting you.  big deal.  i've got videotapes of every pageant from miss universe to miss uhaul.  i'd be happy to offer my services.  thanks, but no, thanks.  i tell you, she's going to regret refusing my offer.  come on, preppie.  you know as much about pageants as i know about

you knew this.  i'm a guy.  the rules don't say you have to be a girl.  let me see.  i'll need my glasses.  ok, let's see here.  .." youcanenter.  do something about your hair.  no one would vote for me.  that's because the kids don't know the real you.  they don't realize all your wonderful qualities.  i have some.  you're full of them.  you'll go where no man has ever gone before.  ok, but i have to be home before dark.  sisters, don't sign up for the pageant.  let belding know we're united against him.  yeah.  kelly, show some enthusiasm.  right.  belding is a sexist. rah. rah. rah.  on second thought, just carry the sign.  hi, jessie, kelly.  nice signs.  pink would've been prettier.  we don't talk to traitors.  i just entered the beauty pageant.  wish me luck.  i'm backing a better contestant.  who.  screech.  are they still there with those signs.  still there, sir.  i don't think you're a pig.  can i have an entry form.  i suppose you want to enter.  don't be ridiculous.  i'm entering screech.  you can't enter a man.  i'm not entering a man. i'm entering screech.  this contest is only for women.  why should women be the only ones put on parade.  entering a man makes a statement.  you want a statement.  here's one. no way, jose.  i'll never be beauty queen.  hold it. hold it.  you're discriminating against men.  they'll join us in the picket line.  i'll get you 20 men.  i'll deliver three geeks and a nerd.  let's not let this get out of hand.  jessie, if i let this contestant enter the pageant, will you stop protesting.  a man in a beauty contest would be a big step forward.  let screech enter, and i'll end the protest.  ok. sign up.  mom will be so proud.  indoor food.  and unlock the freshness of the outdoors for your indoor cat.  fueling an exhilarating
