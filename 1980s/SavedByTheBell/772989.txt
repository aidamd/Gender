does that mean.  i surrender, screechnovich. you're too good.  he's too good.  whoo. yay. whoo.  hey. what's going on here.  first the russian was winning, then the russian was losing, now the russian's hopping on stage in his underwear.  quite a game, huh.  that's not peter. that's some faker.  well, let's find out who the faker is.  ow.  ow.  morris, you'd better have an amazing explanation for this.  we made this teeny bet with valleybut they stole screech's lucky hat so he would lose.  we did it for bayside.  hats. kidnapping. gambling.  that's it.  both schools are disqualified for unsportsmanlike conduct.  you can't do that.  these guys were innocent pawns.  screech and the commie knew nothing about this.  they didn't.  i don't know.  if we canceled the bet, could they play.   all right, but only if you call it off.  guys, the bet's off, all right.  everybody happy.   why not. what do you want.  its co. i want my pants back.  wait a minute. the bet's off.

shall study the ecology of a pond.  where did these animals come from.  they're visiting from the pond behind the football field.  now, to them, this is a field trip.  doesn't it bother them to be moved.  get real.  who'd miss sitting in stagnant water.  i would.  let's get to know our pond pals better, shall we.  can i hold the frog.  don't let him. he'll give it a wart.  that's a misconception.  frogs don't give warts.  ..  miss turtle, how about holding this turtle.  ii can't. it's slimy.  oh, i'll hold it. it's cute.  phelps, i'm sorry i'm late, but this duck's hurt.  what happened.  i hit a baseball over the fence.  i guess he got hit by the ball.  yeah.  he should have ducked.  and so should you.  ah, she'll be o.k.  she's just a little dazed.  hit by a ball. typical.  that's what happens when man encroaches upon animals' domain.  it was an accident, not a case forl.a. law.  she'll be fine.  we'll observe her and the other animals here, and then naturally in the pond.  it's friday.  can i take her home for the weekend.  all right, zack. seems like a good idea.  come on, little lady.  i'm sorry i hit you with a ball.  forgive me.   hi, guys. whoa, becky.  becky, is that you.  quack, quack, quack, quack.  are you sure you didn't hit him in the head.  i think the stress of being principal's got you.  no. i'm talking to my friend becky.  i feed her every day at the pond.  you feed this duck.  also lyle, sammy, oh, manny.  and what about donald and daffy.  i think we're talking to daffy.  i grew up on a farm.  i named the animals.  is becky all right.  a baseball hit her.  what.  dr. phelps says becky will be fine soon.  take care of her.  we're putting new goal posts in.  i have to go, too.  i'm the h20 distribution engineer.  that means he's a water boy.  becky, you listen to what zack says and get well.   becky, how about lunch.  don't be shy.  you're talking to a duck.  i've had ducks. i know what they eat.  a box of quackers.  you'll never guess what happened putting up the new goal posts.  they buried belding.  no. they were drilling and hit a pipe line.  there's oil.  that's what happens when man alters the natural order of the environment.  chill out. it was a chick digging the hole.  too bad they didn't strike oil for real.  we'd be the richest school in the world.  we could buy anything we wanted.  yeah. yeah.  good morning, rich students of bayside.  today is our history midterm.  kerns, i do believe you are forgetting the rules.  what rules.  the rule that we're rich, and there are no rules.  you rang, sir.

comfortable, miss jessie.  quiet, belding.  i'm tracking down environmental polluters.  i'm going to tie their noses to exhaust pipes until they go solar.  would you care for some lunch while you change the world.  yes.  here's your order from chez kelly.  chez kelly. what happened to the max.  i renamed it when i bought it.  well, give me my food.  don't talk like that.  i'm the richest
