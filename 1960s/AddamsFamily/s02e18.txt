'course not. no. i'm gonna go on a crash program of diet and exercise, but secret. secret. yeah. you know how gomez and morticia feel about exercise. they think it's silly. i'll have to do it early in the morning. hey, i'll do it with that guy on tv, jack la lanne. the muscle man. he's on at 6:50 in the morning. what are you moaning about. i'm the one that's gotta get up and do it. one, two, three, four. one, two, three, four. come on, ladies, hit it. one, two, three, four. one tummies in. shoulders back, squat. hit it. one, two, three, four. one, two, three, four. come on, one, two, three, four what is he doing. he's either dancing to the late late show or exercising to the early early show. one, two, three, four. hi. isn't that jack la lanne, the physical culture fellow. never heard of him. gomez. that television set goes back to the junk man. good thinking. hey. i can't get you on tv anymore, so i decided on a personal approach. i need help. you know, you said it was an emergency and it certainly is. you know, i've seen people let themselves go. but you're almost gone. touch. morticia. isn't that that television fellow with uncle fester. i do believe it is. that's odd having him here. fester's up to something. darling, have you ever known uncle fester to be sneaky and underhanded. only when he was up to something shady. say, what do you generally eat. oh, the usual thing. eye of newt. pure of aardvark. roast yak. you know, they say we're what we eat. and, mister, you really are. look, it's all in this booklet. this is the astronaut's guide. and whatever it calls for in here goes double for you. roger. four, three, two, one. blast off. boy, this exercise makes you thirsty. turn it off. well, now. a little punching the bag. well, i've stopped punching the bag. now, what's the next exercise in that astronaut book that la lanne gave me. deep kneebends. deep kneebends. all right, you count. we'll start with about 50. one. down. more. i got down all right. you've got to get me up. oh, boy. listen to those muscles expand. well. that's enough deep kneebends. what's the next exercise. chest pulley. that will be a snap. thank you. must be stuck. yeah. i think i got the hang of it now. sure. well, don't just stand there, help me. now i got the idea. let me have it. my, he was in a hurry. lurch, we know we can count on you. what's troubling fester. i think he's trying to tell us something. is he in trouble. he's beginning to weaken. is it a money matter. an emotional disturbance. a health problem. we're getting warm. a health problem. darling, you're right. uncle fester's ill. of course, that's it. it's written all over his face. just had to keep probing. thank you, lurch. thank you for being so helpful. uncle fester, what are you doing. relaxing. fester, old boy. your problem is solved. it is. yes, we're going to have a doctor here for you in an hour. this is the addams house. yep. you're going in there. good luck, charlie. i'm doctor motley. follow me. doctor motley. just a moment, doctor, where are you going. i am going to nail up a quarantine sign. i can tell just by looking at you, there's an epidemic in this house. really, doctor, there's no need for hysterics. only one of us is sick. which one. uncle fester, of course. just hasn't been himself. oh, i'm not sick. i just had a complete physical examination. blood pressure, perfect. pulse, perfect. reaction time, perfect. liver, soso. soso. well, you can't win them all. who performed this examination. i did. it may not be perfect, but it saves a lot of time. fester, where are you going. up to my room to sharpen my scalpel. your scalpel. yes. if my liver count keeps dropping, i may have to operate. uncle fester. as long as doctor motley is here, how about an examination. oh. need the practice, hey, doc. if it weren't for my hippocratic oath, i'd turn in my satchel. you see anything, doctor. yes, i see a face with pincenez glasses. fester's head. either in or let's try it from another angle. do you still see that face, doctor. no, now i see a moose's head. by george, fester always did like to keep an open mind. you know what i think. don't tell me you think he has holes in his head. i think you all have holes in your head. and that includes me. poor fellow. those long internships do take their toll. poor uncle fester. how a man can go to pieces right before your very eyes. not only did he pass up lunch and dinner, but look at him. staring at the full moon and doing deep kneebends. oh, dear, he is sick. usually when the moon is full, he howls at it. darling. you don't suppose his problem could be mental. possible. greater minds than his have been known to crack. remember cousin slump. yes. one moment, a brilliant nuclear physicist. the next, he was running around los alamos in a threecornered hat and a powdered wig. dear. darling, perhaps i should call a psychiatrist. querida, after our experience with dr. motley. you're right. i'll handle this myself. do you remember how much i helped you with your sleepwalking. you mean to analyze him. we must reach his subconscious. be lucky to reach his conscious. darling, we have to try and help him. but how. there are ways. now, uncle fester. i want you to concentrate. concentrate. concentrate. morticia, you're just wasting your time. the only one that can hypnotize me is me. now, watch. sleep. certainly doesn't waste time on preliminaries. yes, but i think we ought to make sure he's really out. test his reflexes. reflexes. yeah. with a hammer, you know. oh. oh, of course. by george, he's really under. now, uncle fester. i want you to listen very carefully. first question. you've been up to something lately, haven't you. yes. would you care to tell us about it. no. uncle fester. tell us. what's going through your poor tortured mind at this very moment. four, three, two, one. blast off. so that's it. what's it. we know now why uncle fester has been doing all this ridiculous exercising and dieting. we do. of course. he wants to become an astronaut. that's wonderful, the first addams in space. a proud moment, isn't it. no, it isn't. we can't let him go. why not. he's dc. district of columbia. direct current. put dc fester in the ac space capsule, and nothing left of fester but a plump asteroid. how courageous. willing to blow himself for science. a true addams. he'd set the space program back 20 years. we must save him from his brave folly. but first we better wake him up. oh, yes. uncle fester. uncle fester. oh, what we do now. you're gonna hit him with that. most certainly not, dear. oh, how horrible. i dreamed i was swimming the english channel and halfway across i sank. no use trying to conceal it. i need more exercises. hello, houston. this is morticia addams and i'd like to speak to the head of your astronaut program. he's asleep. well, wake him, wake him. this is a citizen calling. if he could see you in all your loveliness, he'd pop out of bed in a minute. hello. hello, general. this is morticia addams. now, i don't mean to be critical, but i do think you're going a bit far in drafting uncle fester for your next gemini shot. well, not that he isn't willing to go, of course. but we do feel yes. yes, i do know you have a moon shot in the morning. but that's no reason to lure plump, happy earthlings like uncle fester away. now, now, now. general. that kind of language will not solve any problem. i general. what did he say. i think the phone went dead. morticia. look. good heavens. the general's language must have burned up the phone wires. things have come to a pretty pass when a man can't have any privacy in his own steam cabinet. uncle fester, you can stop this ridiculous exercising. you've been released from the astronaut program. what astronaut program. ours, of course. unless you sold out to the russians. boy, are you offbase. i'm doing this for my pen pal, yvette. exercising for a pen pal. sure. she's from the foliesbergere. and she's gonna come over here and visit me. and when she gets here, i'm gonna be real trim and sexy. miss yvette. already. oh, she can't see me like this. nonsense. fester, old man, you have to go upstairs and face the music. oh, not with this body. perhaps she'll love you for your soul. well, that's even fatter. come on. lurch. where's our visitor from overseas. in the conservatory. oh, please show her in. yes, mrs. addams. you know, morticia, when she sees me, a great postal romance is going right down the drain. brace up, uncle fester. she'll love you for what you are. all of it. yvette. of course, chri, and you must be fester. what an interesting couple. they're almost an interesting quartet. but i thought you were with the foliesbergere. i am, i take care of the costumes. oh, no wonder she's putting on weight. if she takes care of the costumes at the foliesbergere, she doesn't have much to do. in your letter to me, you said to go on a diet. of course, chri. but to gain weight, not to lose it. you are nothing but skin and bones. not my type at all. yvette, you spoke french. of course, chri. what do you expect from a french girl, hungarian. that's an interesting point. well, i must hurry, my cab is waiting. keep writing, chri. well, if you can't believe in the foliesbergere, what's left for a fella. well, one good thing, fester, now you can stop all that ridiculous exercise and dieting. take my advice. put your money on zenyogi. hey. i did it. well, how handsome you both look. as grandpa squint addams used to say about cousin blob, two heads are better than one. that junk man, really a gem, offering me money to take the set back. i'm glad it's back. these moon shots are so exciting. yes. they do stir up the old corpuscles. darling, that missile. why is its tail wagging. oh, i hate to tell you this, querida, but you've tuned in on rin tin tin. there. that's it. fester, is anything wrong. need a little recharging, that's all. what's going on. you're just in time for the moon shot. oh, that. i went through that whole astronaut booklet from cover to cover. i could have gone up in that rocket. i even volunteered to. but it's not what you know, it's who you know. i think they're getting ready for the countdown. five. four. three. five. four. three. two. one two. one. blast off. that's the addams determination. if i know fester, he'll catch up. )
