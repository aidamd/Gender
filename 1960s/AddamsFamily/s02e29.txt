" miss trivia. oh, trivia. darling. trivia, you certainly look well for you. nice of you to say so. we thought you were getting married. oh, i was on the verge, but i just couldn't go through with it. why not. he never asked me. besides, my heart's in showbiz. showbiz. oh boy i'm lucky i'll say i'm lucky this is my lucky day yeah beautiful. how's showbiz treating you, trivia. they love me in altoona. one reviewer compared my scene to the mating call of a platypus. no wonder they're becoming extinct. uncle fester. allow me. why, thank you, lurch, darling. what's the matter with lurch. he is acting rather peculiarly. i bet he had some of mama's salamander puffs. he just can't eat rich deserts. well, as we show folks say, i think i'll take five and go freshen up a bit. traveling, it's such a tiring bore. of course, dear. lurch, take miss trivia's things up to her room, please. yes, mrs. addams. lurch, no. i said, miss trivia's things, not miss trivia. sorry, lost my head. i'll have to apologize for lurch. i don't understand what came over him. i can. he's in love. lurch in love. impossible. well, who can he be in love with around here. poor boys there just seems to be something about me they simply can't resist. i wonder what it could be. how do you feel about lurch. well, he's rather cute, but i have no time for love. showbiz is my entire life. oh boy i'm lucky i'll say i'm lucky oh boy i'm lucky with a voice like that she should get life. this calls for some nerve settling. poor lurch, love at first sight. maybe, he should take a second look. they would make a handsome couple. oh, well, c'est la vie. tish, you spoke french. gomez, darling, please, there is a time and place for everything. how about here and now. dear, i'm worried about lurch. who's lurch. our butler. oh, lurch. yes. i think we should find out how serious he is about trivia. good idea. maybe it's just temporary insanity. you rang. yes, lurch. i well, that is, we, couldn't help but notice how taken you were with miss trivia. oh. come, come now, lurch, your feelings are written all over your face. just look at him. by george, morticia, you're right. if i ever saw a lovesick expression. he's sick all right. oh, it's so romantic. oh boy i'm lucky i'll say i'm lucky here she comes again, lurch. now, just walk right up to her and tell her how you feel. no. well, nothing to it, old man. well, we'll be in the conservatory watching. after all, two is company. and with trivia, it could be a crowd. well, where is everybody. watching. he sure thinks fast on his feet. watching. who. oh, well, it doesn't matter. i've got to get on with my rehearsing. showbiz, you know. miss trivia yes, lurch, you wanted to say something. speak up, speak up. i've got no time for idle chatter. nice day. that's not much of a proposal, but it's a good weather report. is that all you wanted to tell me. well, what else. come, come. i have got to get on with my career. you and oh, i know. you want my autograph, right. no. oh, of course, you're trying to tell me you're smitten with me. naturally, but my heart's still in showbiz. well, better luck next time. oh boy i'm lucky i'll say i'm lucky this is my lucky day oh, dear this is going to be terrible for poor lurch's ego. not to mention his personality, either. yeah, he's such a fun kid. bit on the shy side, though. a bit. i have an idea. if we can only change trivia's mind about lurch. how can we. you heard her, all she cares about is showbiz. but if we could convince her that lurch is even more exciting she might give it all up for him. that's a capital idea, querida. oh, but we can never do that. we'd have to make a whole new man out of him. i'll just fire a volley of the old addams spirit into him. wednesday and i could work on his social graces. they have been sadly neglected. yeah, and after a couple of hours with me, why, he'll know all there is to know about women. what do you know about women, fester. well, i had a mother, didn't i. take it from an old latin lover, lurch. nothing brings out the woman in the woman more than the man in the man. trivia sees you in a gaucho outfit, she'll be a goner. i hope so. well, look what it did for valentino. when she sees you've mastered the bola, that will really knock her for a loop. now, watch. watch carefully. style the form now, the crucial thing about the bola is knowing exactly when to let go. a split second too soon or a split second too late let that be a lesson to you. oh, gomez, darling, did you help lurch. i tried to teach him the mastery of the south american bola. you're an expert at that. yes, but i'm afraid he's a slow learner. not all men have your talents, darling. or yours. oh, by george, morticia. you have outdone yourself. what is it. well, i was going to call it mishmosh at dawn, but i'm afraid that's a bit pretentious. well, you may be right. i think i'll call it just plain, simple blob. it's perfect. well, i think i'll have another go at lurch. perhaps modern dance this time. oh, darling, wednesday's teaching him that. oh, capital. blob, however did you think of it. well, actually i heard someone describing my last painting that way. and it inspired me. querida. darling. this is the latest. it's called the droop. come on, now you try it. me. i think miss trivia's a swinger. swinger. you don't want her to think you're square, do you. then if you learn how to dance well, she'll think you're boss. "boss". neat groovy come on. try it. loosen up a little, let yourself go. oh boy i'm lucky i'll say i'm lucky this is my lucky day you got it, lurch. oh, what a pleasant surprise. i thought the mazurka went out ages ago. wednesday, darling, you're excused. please turn off the phonograph. yes, mother. lurch, the music has stopped. i know, but i can't. now, here we are, darling. now, cleopatra, mother knows best, dear. you simply must get on a lowcalorie diet. open up cleopatra, your tentacles are getting thick. open up. querida. good morning, darling. oh, my. you look a bit under. glad to hear it, because that's the way i feel. couldn't get a wink of sleep with lurch moaning all the night. oh, yes. i heard him, too. moaning and walking the floor. sounded like a herd of elephants. where is he. i haven't seen him this morning. he's probably with uncle fester finishing his course in the feminine mystique. good. if i know fester, he'll pull no punches. he's a man's man. and now, lurch, my boy, you and i are going to have a mantoman talk. now, the first thing is we i seem to be a man short. lurch. now, if you wanna make any headway with trivia, you've gotta understand all about women. and that's my department. now, the most important thing is the proper approach. now, i'll be trivia. oh boy i'm lucky they say i'm lucky this is my lucky day well, pick it up. keep going. no no. that's not what you're supposed to do. you're supposed to take it and say, "pardon me, you dropped your handkerchief. "how about a date tonight, baby." you got it. okay, now try it again. oh boy i'm lucky this is my lucky poise, lurch, poise. dropped handkerchief. how about a what's the matter, lurch. you're not my type. i'm going to end it all. oh, good. now, we're getting someplace. well, how are things in the school of romance. school just let out. lurch is going to end it all. that's ridiculous. you can't do away with yourself just like that. that's right. you gotta leave a note. exactly. spoken like a man, lurch. we have to find just the right note. something that will make trivia come to her senses. yeah, make her realize what a good catch she could have had. be a real happy ending. make a note, thing. how about, "dear trivia". no, it sounds a little flat. you know, a note like this should start off with a real grabber for trivia to find in lurch's outstretched hand. good thinking, fester. how about, "farewell beloved". no suspense. you give away the whole ending. fester, you're a born showman. how's this, "to whom it may concern". bingo. changed my mind. changed your mind. lurch, there no sense just hanging around being miserable, is there. no, maybe, we could figure out some glamorous way for him to go like jumping off the roof. too messy. lurch, how do you feel about gas. gives me heartburn. yeah, me too. forget about it. this is a happy little group. is lurch's problem solved. beautifully, he's gonna end it all. very romantic, but isn't that a bit extreme. did romeo and juliet think it was a bit extreme. certainly not. and they lived happily ever after. or did they. no, uncle fester, they did not. besides, where would we find a replacement for dear lurch. querida, your wisdom is exceeded only by your great beauty. french. and bubele, too. gomez, not now, not now. we gotta solve lurch's problem first. oh, yes, lurch's problem. lurch, i think you should sweep miss trivia off her feet. yes, mrs. addams. thank you, thing. no, lurch. forget about the sweeping. miss trivia is very musicalminded. why don't you appeal to that side of her nature. serenade her. exactly. ah, that's our lurch, willing to try anything. tish, our song. hits you right here. lurch, you try it. i think we better forget about the serenading. we'll just have to leave it up to mama. mama. yes, she's going to work on dear trivia. well, if anyone can do it, it's mama. she's a real femme fatale. i spoke french. bye. is it true you're really going to help lurch's romance, grandmother. well, you can't leave these things to amateurs. what are you going to do. i'm going about it scientifically. a love potion. oh boy i'm lucky i'll say i'm lucky oh, trivia. is someone calling me. come and get your yak juice. yak juice. nice and scalding. oh, good, it does wonders for my complexion. where's that man. coming up. you rang. lurch, you great big, wonderful hunk of masculinity. well, i guess you two love birds wanna be alone. where, oh, where have you been all my life. the kitchen. nothing like a leisurely stroll on the freeway. i'm yours, lurch. my heart, my soul, my bank account. it looks like my coaching paid off. lurch really hit pay dirt. looks more like an avalanche. tell me you love me, lurch. tell me, tell me, tell me. oh, say it again. oh, please. bashful, eh. i'll unbashful you. changed mind. come back. come back, lurch. ah, dear trivia. she's finally come to her senses. i guess old lurch just broke down her resistance. he does have an irresistible charm. reminds me of casanova addams. when he toyed with women's hearts. when he was jailed for nonpayment of alimony. let me in, lurch. no. ah, trivia. gomez. you great big, lovable brute. is there some mistake. certainly not. you're a man, aren't you. you're drunk with love, you don't know what you're doing. i may be drunk with love, but i know what i'm doing. oh, gomez. gosh, it sure is quiet around here. quiet and full of love. love. lurch and trivia have finally found each other. well, i could see where he'd have a little trouble finding her. they've fallen in love. i can't see where she'd have any trouble love. madly. well, it may not be an ideal marriage, but it'll certainly make an ideal divorce. oh, no, uncle fester. trivia's a oneman woman. gomez, darling, what's wrong. trivia, she's in love with me. you better make that a twoman woman. gomez, that's impossible. you're a married man. i think that sort of slipped trivia's mind. i tried to get away, but she was like a tigress. oh, dear. i can't believe it. my best friend, a husbandstealer. she could get in trouble doing that. that's petty larceny. fester, you've gotta calm her down. you have to explain to her what it would do to lurch if he found out she was hopelessly in love with me. better explain what it would do to me, too. don't worry, i'll straighten it out. darling, isn't it a comfort to have a person like uncle fester to take things in hand. you beautiful, delicious man. i'm mad for you. this is destiny. haven't you got me mixed up with gomez, or is it lurch. all i know is i'm mad, mad, mad for you. you know something, i think you're fickle. only as far as men are concerned. trivia. i thought you were in love with gomez. and i thought you were in love with lurch. oh, those were just silly, little infatuations. this is the man i really love. but i'm a confirmed bachelor. since when. since just now. i just love it when they play hard to get. itt. you marvelous mountain of hair. oh, you know just what to say to a woman. gomez, this thing with trivia has gone far enough. you're absolutely right. jilting me for fester. uncle fester does have an inner magnetism. yes, he does have that certain je ne sais quoi. tish, that's french, i wish you'd said that. trivia now, darling, je ne sais quoi later. you said it. later, darling. later. later. you're the only man i've ever loved. you have a girl. excuses. excuses. this is destiny. fate. tell me you love me. tell me, tell me, tell me. say it again. either that's cousin itt or uncle fester needs a shave. you delicious man. cousin itt, i'm so glad i found you. trivia, what's the meaning of this. you can't do this to lurch and fester and well, you can forget about me. oh, i have. i have. i found my one, my true what's the matter with him. why are you staring at me that way. oh. something happened here. what. well, we thought you were in love. love. me. oh, silly. well, i've got to be going. showbiz is calling. oh boy i'm lucky i'll say i'm lucky i'll help her pack. this is my lucky day lurch seems eager to get rid of her. i guess he's fickle, too. in that case, it's too bad. they would have made a perfect match. poor lurch. we failed him. and when i think of how beautiful it could have all been. if only he had taken that final step. into matrimony. off the roof. well, we all make mistakes. i still can't understand what went wrong. this stuff always worked before. well, i'm sort of glad. now lurch won't leave. that's true. i think i'll go feed my spiders. oh boy i'm lucky i'll say i'm lucky this is my lucky day what is it, mama. age, my boy. just age. )
