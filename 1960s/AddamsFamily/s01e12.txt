"foreign diplomats visiting our city. roger l. harris to conduct tour for vlps.

take. if guide fails assignment, washington masters will chop off head. naturally. no, i don't mean they'll chop my head off. i mean they'll fire me. and then set fire to him. destroy evidence. gentlemen, look, you take our language too literally. for two days now your washington masters have shown us phony tour. they only show us what they want us to see. you do not show us the real america. the downtrodden masses slaving under bureaucratic whip. we want to see the people. the real peoples. peoples. all right. all right, anything you say. you can see anybody you want to. good. we choose honest way. by chance. we stick pin into phone book. wherever pin strikes we go. all right with me. miri haan, phone book. i'll get a pin. we use our own pin. always. eeny, meeny, miney, boom. what's the matter, tish. something wrong. that's strange. i felt just as though i'd been stuck with a pin. the addams. oh, no, no, they aren't they're off limits. excuse me, sir. please don't go in there. aha. guide begs us not to go in. why. why. because we have found real american family, not phony bureaucratic setup. that's not so. and government will chop off his head for this. poor fellow. come. we go see some real americans. look, fellows, i know where there's a dandy little bar downtown with beautiful dancing girls. you'll have a ball there. aha. miri, take note. guide tries to bribe us but we refuse. we are strong men. we go later. now we go see typical american family. very interesting. i take note. mrs. addams, you have a very interesting house here. i have seen nothing like it before in america. well, it's nothing out of the ordinary, but we like it. mortlcla: and i'm so glad you gentlemen could come. you've brightened our day immensely. harris, it was very nice of you to bring them here. well, it wasn't my idea he was very eager for us to meet average american family, is not so, mr. harris. i keep telling you. the addams are not an average family at all. how sweet. don't be turning our heads with flattery. i do wish i'd known you were coming. i could've planned some sort of amusement. oh, no, please. we wish to observe everyday routine. agreed. mortlcla: whatever you wish. psst. our house is your house, gentlemen. mr. haan, may i offer you a cigar. here, have one. i will save for later. let's join the conversation. psst. mr. haan, sit down. miri haan, you're smoking. oh, no, i save for later. mr. haan, i'm terribly sorry. i should've warned you it was a live cigar. i begged you not to come here in the first place. well, gentlemen, we'd better be running along. i'm sure you've seen enough. and i think we send this back home to laboratory. i had no idea it was so late. if you gentlemen will excuse me, it's time to go feed my plants. yes, they get pretty cranky when they're hungry. plants. plants get hungry. cranky. well, after all, they're only human. i'm quite proud of mrs. addams' hothouse. she's raised these plants from tiny weeds. darling, would you. gardening is all a matter of proper feeding. and these plants just love meat. meat. especially when it's medium rare. yes, they're really meat eaters. i've seen them. especially that one. it's a regular little glutton. oh, no, no, no. cleopatra, really. mr. harris was only joking, darling. she's really a sweet little thing. she's terribly young. not very smart. but she's learning. open up, sweetheart. have some more. there. yes. this is plant, not animal. and it is learning. she's quite slow, actually. she's three years old and she can't even feed herself yet. open up, sweetheart. excuse me. this is big thing we have discovered. big. very big. they've learnt to breed plants that have the intelligence of humans. and a mere woman has done this. an american woman. perhaps they have gone further than this. and harris thought he could hide this from us. it's all right. we will learn the truth. take notes, miri haan. plenty notes. plenty notes. plenty notes. the mail's in. thank you, thing. what is that. just your imagination. don't let him pull your leg. thing is as real as any of us. thing, come up and meet our guests. thing. now, now. dear thing, he doesn't know his own strength. anything exciting in the mail, dear. oh yes, lots of bills. wonderful. will you excuse us, please. is it real. muscle and bone, with a grip like iron. they have made this. a hand, a single hand by itself. lt likes privacy. this is fantastic. take notes, miri haan. take notes. american family has taken first step towards building robots. first a plant that moves and thinks and then a hand of flesh and blood. this is big. very big. bigger than big. i write everything down. everything. beautiful wreck, isn't it. beautiful wreck. beautiful wreck. hello, i didn't

automobiles. wonderful hobby. stay away from water, uncle fester. the last time he was recharged he took a shower and blew out every fuse in the house. americans, in order to get energy energy. put

himself. he just can't keep out of mischief. remember the antigravity machine he made, and what happened when he turned it on the postman. oh, yes, that was amusing. the mailman just went floating off up in the air. he really hated to come down. he said the floating was so much easier on his feet. he needs to rest. well, be my guest. i just had the whole thing sharpened. oh, no, no. or maybe you'd

harris, there is an art in relaxing. well, i'll never master it in this menagerie. i almost got wiped out by a ray gun. that pugsley. such a showoff. that's how we lost cousin creep. there he was, giggling and laughing and suddenly there he wasn't, still giggling and laughing. it was kind of eerie. but that was old creepy. he could always take a joke. well the impression those two men are getting in this house, it could disrupt international relations. i did think they were getting a little bored. what if i was to go in and do some parlor trick. i can saw a woman in half. oh, no, no, no. oh, yes. it goes the only trouble i have is getting her together again. very strange man. that is restful. i'm very worried. this is not what we expected. how can you expect what is so unexpected.
