"i know i shall always want you for my very own. " can it be true, uncle fester. can she actually be smitten with this lionel. who's lionel. fester. oh, that lionel. must be. just going off riding with him. i engineered that so we could talk. well, still, forgetting to feed her plants. poor things, they're nearly starved. they won't even iet me feed them. a hideous how do you do. why don't you throw him out. i couldn't. she would have thought that i was jealous. are you. of course. it's gnawing at my insides, iike a tiger gnawing at an antelope. i wish it would stop. i'm beginning to enjoy it. well, you gotta get rid of him somehow. i have a plan. we'll make it so uncomfortable for him that he'll want to ieave. i'll need your help. you can count on me. first, we rearrange his room. brilliant. well, no use ietting this go to waste. why

gomez, you ought to stretch out for a while. wonderful pickerupper. i don't have time. we must concoct another scheme to break up this romance. i have it. a diversionary tactic. another woman. oh, that's good. you mean to come between him and morticia, huh. right. a seductive creature with an irresistible allure. now, where can we find one. how about grandmama. you know, the merry widow. no, grandmama prefers taller men. but she is the type we want. maybe we could get my old sweetheart, queenie. no, she'd never ieave the circus. those bearded iadies make a fortune. if only he hadn't seen lurch. you know, he'd be ideal in a wig and a dress. if only lurch were a maid instead of a butler. that's it. a maid. i'll hire a maid from an employment agency. i'll insist on one who is interested in getting married. good. right this way, miss what is your name. mildred, sir. gee, this place is sort of spooky. thank you. now, about your duties oh, no. i'm not staying. i think i can change your mind, miss. you don't have that much money. but i do have a houseguest. a dashing young bachelor who would find you most attractive. a man, sir. the kind who needs a wife. in fact, he is seeking one desperately, and it could be you. well, this isn't such a bad place after all. your room is right in there. well, uncle fester, it iooks iike we have a winner. a knockout. those tiny eyes shining through her glasses. and did you notice the way her knees knock together. uncle fester, at your age. i've still got an eye for beauty. by tomorrow, lionel will be her slave. is there anything i could bring you, sir. no, no. tea or coffee. milk. vegetable juice. no, no, no and no. what's the matter with you, anyway. you followed me all over the place iast night. when i turned in, i iooked under the bed to make sure you weren't there. now there you go again. she's not making much progress. too shy. i'll iight it for you, sir. that does it. this girl needs instruction in the art of iove from an expert. you. in my younger days, i had women eating out of my hand. a bit messy, wasn't it. you're simply too timid. you've got to move in on him. you mean chase him. i mean catch him. grab him in your arms, iike this. and pour out your heart. no ionger can i hide my feelings, my iove. give me your iips. there, have you got it now. where is lionel. which way did he go. never mind. i'll find him. thank you, thing. i'm sorry to make a spectacle of myself, thing. but my world has come down around my ears. there's another woman. no, it's true, there is. i know you can be blase about it. you've never been married. or have you. i thought not. thing, what am i gonna do. no, no. no violence. not even hairpulling. nor eyescratching. thank you, anyway, thing. thing. wish me iuck. thank you, thing. you're a true friend. i didn't know you were out here, morticia. uncle fester, i know why gomez brought that woman into this house. oh, you do, huh. well, so do i, and i think it's a fine idea. a fine idea. no, no. cieopatra, no. i will not condone violence. down, girl. i think i'll go upstairs to my room and iie down for a while. i'm going up the back stairs. you see. everything worked out fine, smarty. you hit me in the nose. well, well, well. checking your stocks, i see. how're they going. up, naturally. you know, you folks have been wonderful to me, gomez. in fact, i'm very fond of the whole family. especially morticia, hmm. i've always had a warm spot for her. what i started to say was, i'm going to do you a big favor. you see, a pal of mine is the president of the south tasmanian oil corporation if your pal put your money into south tasmanian oil, you ought to have him boiled in it. the market is bullish today, lionel. i mean, mr. barker. bullish. you mean, you really dig this jazz. well, i've always put my money into stocks. let's not talk about stocks, mildred. let's talk about you. me. come. let me gaze into your big, beautiful, blue chip eyes. is something wrong. tell me. i think you know what's darkened our iives. yes, i fear i do. the hands that should caress my ioving feet now caress the dragon. but who are you caressing in your mind. not me. gomez, please ieave me. i can't talk now. i must think. very well. if that's what you want, i'll go. i, too, must think. there is no ionger any doubt about it. she's in iove with lionel. well, what are you going to do. the only decent thing i can do. leave this iife, and iet morticia marry the man she ioves. you mean you're going to kill yourself. of course not. suicide is the coward's way out. i'm going to iet you kill me. me. you're my favorite nephew, gomez. you've been nice to me. i iike you. aii i ask is one small favor. shoot me. well, if i refuse, i'd be an ingrate. aii right, stand over by the wall. thank you, uncle fester. you're a true friend. ready. aim. fire. i would iike to be shot, uncle fester, not drowned. i'm sorry, this must be one of the children's guns. but i'll do better next time. you must. it's the only bullet we have. now, close your eyes. lurch, i hope you're a better hangman than uncle fester was a marksman. it's my rope, isn't it, gomez. i furnished the rope. that's a bit scratchy. better, sir. that's fine. thank you, lurch. very comfortable. would you throw the other end of the rope up over the rafter. no, no, wait a minute. it's my rope. i can aii i have to do is just throw it up over this rafter iike this. what's the matter with that thing. uncle fester, do you recall where you got that rope years ago. sure, don't you remember. i got it from an old friend of mine, raj maja, the indian fakir. yeah, he used to throw it up in the air, then he'd climb still works, doesn't it. it's no use, lurch. apparently, i am doomed to iive. sorry, sir. you rang. gad, she's iovely. how could i iive without her. yet i must. morticia, i must speak to you. and i to you. gomez, we've had a iong and happy marriage. yes, we have, indeed. our iife together has been filled with joy. until now. i've heard of other marriages, where someone new has come along and iove grew cold. and husband and wife have come to the parting of the ways. we have come to the parting of the ways, gomez. our hour has struck. we've gotta do something, lurch. soothing music. to the harpsichord. what will be, will be. i have no regrets. nor do i. aii i want is your happiness. my only wish is to make you happy. now that you're in iove with someone else, i'll step aside. though my heart is breaking, i'll freely give you up, so you can go away with mildred. so you can go away with lionel. mildred. lionel. somebody call us. i don't want mildred. i thought you were in iove with lionel. me. querido. querida. we just dropped in to give you the good news. we're off on our honeymoon. honeymoon. you're married. about an hour ago. at city hall. congratulations. that's wonderful. well, iet's go, baby. gomez, i'm so happy for them. i'm even happier for us. if i wasn't such a rotten shot, you wouldn't be here, would you. what's this. i nearly did an impulsive thing, my dear. but my guardian spirit was iooking after me. somebody down there iikes me. somebody up here iikes you, too, bubele. there. "when the blazing sun has turned to mud "and the moon iies dead in a pool of blood, "and the tomtom beat of eternity starts, "whom will i iove in my heart of hearts. "morticia. " gomez, that's beautiful. and it's such a perfect night for poetry. i just wanted to show you that lionel's not the only one who can write poetry for you. oh, lionel. he couldn't hold a candle to you. perhaps we should iet him try it sometime. might be a fascinating experience. no, he'll be too busy for that. oh. working night and day, poor chap. those stocks his wife owns, down to nothing. really. well, things iike that don't matter, not when you marry for iove. )
