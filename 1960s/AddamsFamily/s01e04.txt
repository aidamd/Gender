"modernize the city, put in more streetlights, "drain the swamps.

"my friends" hold it. that'ii never go, dear. get right to the issues. you're right. "one of the major issues of the day is peace. " well, that's true, dear. but everybody wants peace. even mr. quimby. you're right. "and now, to the matter of taxes. "shall we have high taxes. or shall we have iow taxes." isn't that a dangerous position. you're right. "which brings us to the question of education" nope, much too controversial. you're right. "aiso the question of social welfare." "now we come to the biggest, the most burning issue of the day, "the question of" you make that out. "question of swamps. " oh, yes. "as to the matter of swamps" darling, the iess said about that the better. very clever, querida, very clever. "i thank you. " well i know what you're going to say. after such an enlightening and courageous speech, i shouldn't thank them, they should thank me. i agree completely. now, you all know what you're supposed to do. lurch, you hit the swanky oak knoll section. roger. mama. i get off in the business district. you parade up and down the street with your placard and you blow your bugle. uncle fester, is your assignment clear. i sing, iight up and pass out $3 bills. remember, the secret word is "dignity. " aii right, lurch, blast off. don't they make a fineiooking group. mr. hilliard is as good as elected. oak knoll is in the bag, huh. great, keep in touch. well, everything iooks good so far. polls

see things. thank you, mel, and there you see why would mr. hilliard chase uncle fester with a stick. nonsense, dear. didn't you hear the reporter admit he was seeing things. of course. hilliard will probably be along any minute to express his gratitude. boss, you can't go in there. it's suicide. that's my mood exactly. but i've got to get those addamses off the street or i'm sunk. well, i'm not going in. that's the first intelligent thing you've said in the entire campaign. get down to the polls and see what's going on. right. bass. boss. call my mother and tell her not to wait up for me. good idea. hilliard, we've been expecting you. i should think so. i'ii take your hat. no, no, no, i'm holding on to it this time. come on in. mrs. addams piease don't say it. i will, too, say it. mr. addams and i find expressions of gratitude so embarrassing. expressions of gratitude. your election will be our reward. i'm going to turn this whole thing over to a iawyer. a iawyer. yes. my card. gomez is responsible for putting more criminals behind bars than any other man in the united states. you, a prosecuting attorney. attorney for the defense. well, i don't need you for my iawyer and i

me. thank you, thing. addams here. yes, he's here too. it's for you. probably your opponent, quimby, conceding the election. only a case of election day jitters. i hope so. why don't you answer it. you answer it. of course, old boy. addams here. i'ii take the message. oh, hello, bass. really. some of the first returns are in. oak knoll, eh. good. i see. good work, bass. it's a iandslide. for hilliard. for quimby. 76 to nothing. i knew it, i knew it. those early returns. of course, the oak knoll section, upper class snobs, always contrary to the main trend. i'ii get it. thank you, thing. darling, you iook a iittle tired. why don't you just relax. hello. this is mrs. addams speaking. yes, he's here. it's for you again. i'm not going near that thing. i'ii take the message. oh hello, mr. bass. really. it's the 9th precinct. well, that's much better. hilliard 6, quimby 1 10. see. you're beginning to gain. i'm ruined. ruined. come now, mr. hilliard, that's the 9th precinct. nothing but iower class people. that's not where your strength is. if that's for me, i don't wanna talk to anybody. addams here. bass, what's the word. come, now, bass, you can think of another word. i see. well, the middle class section is the most important. fine. aii right, iet me have it. if i were you, i'd demand a recount. oh, no. hilliard 5, quimby 204. not bad, really. you only iost one vote. i'm sure there's been some fraud. yes, bass admits it. too bad they caught him. i'ii get it. hello, mrs. addams speaking. yes, mr. quimby. mr. hilliard's here. i'm afraid he can't come to the phone right now. what. mr. quimby, i'm sure you're mistaken. eiectronic computers do not vote. mr. quimby is claiming victory. wonderful. what's wonderful about it. can't you see, old man. the trap. the achilles' heel. the waterloo of every politician. overconfidence. the poor dear. the sweet smell of success must have been too much for him. i'm so glad you joined the zenyogi society, darling. right, querida. after a strenuous campaign, at ieast you can relax. every man should iearn to relax this way. it's a wonderful gift. it says mr. hilliard is quitting politics. really. must be his health. must be. because it says he's thinking of ieaving town, too. as a matter of fact, it says he's thinking of ieaving the country. poor man, i was so sure he'd win. i guess we got into the campaign too iate. gomez, i'm afraid we failed. not according to quimby. he says if it wasn't for us, he wouldn't have won. what a generous thing to say. why, thank you, thing. maybe we should have gotten thing into the campaign. no, i guess not. hello. this is mrs. addams speaking. why, hello, mr. hilliard. really. isn't that nice. well, thank you. goodbye. that was that nice mr. hilliard. he says he's glad he lost. the mayor appointed him head of the school board. it's a much better position. in that case, i'm proud to have served. alleyoop. oop. where are you going, darling. to the playroom. to add mr. hilliard to our illustrious collection. )
