the far corners of the earth. but first, we'll have a spot of lunch. thank you, lurch. magnificent lunch. i should be honored to have your recipe for the cherries jubilee. cherries jubilee. oh, that was flambeau of jellyfish. flambeau of jellyfish. how did you two get together. mama, please. they're not on the witness stand. how did you two get together. it was at this wonderful ionely hearts club luau. i looked over the suckling pig, and there she was. well, if you have so much money, what were you doing at a ionely hearts club. mama, please. what were you doing at a ionely hearts club. i was looking for a simple girl. you sure struck oil. well, it's time for a walk in the garden. allow me. i just love when she does that. come, horatio. my love. well, querida, what do you think. he's charming. rich. attractive. magnetic. impossible. exactly. too perfect. the man's an obvious phony. an imposter. how shall we prove it. simple matter. he claims he's rich. i'll call brad and dunstreet, the financial authorities. excellent thinking, darling. one of them is bound to be in. hello, brad and dunstreet. gomez addams here. try to keep a civil tongue in your head. just making an enquiry. what do you have on horatio bartholomew. yes, i'll wait. they're running him through their computer. the marvels of science. they're running him through their computer, and he's walking in our garden. all at the same time. amazing. what. yes. are you sure. thank you. just as i thought. they never heard of horatio bartholomew. oh, my darling sister. in the hands of a scheming adventurer. a ionely hearts club bluebeard. poor ophelia. if your cousin itt hadn't been such a playboy, they might be married by now. perhaps we can have another talk with the little rou. rou. that's french. i wish you'd said that. darling, please. let's concentrate on cousin itt. what. cousin itt. oh, yes, yes. oh, cousin itt. at least we know he's up there. let me try, dear. careful of the soot. okay, dear. cousin itt. would you come down, please. we'd like to have a little chat with you. itt, you come down here this minute. well, now we know another thing. the chimney needs cleaning. cousin itt. if you don't come down i'm going to be very hurt. i scared you down, didn't i. cousin itt, you know how fond we are of you. thank you. you do put things so nicely. itt, we think you are perfect husband material. suave, sophisticated, cultured. yes, and loaded, too. now, with women throwing themselves at you all the time, of course you've probably become a bit jaded. that's true. if a person is going to become jaded, that is the best way. but we think it's time that you settle down, got married. itt, are you still with us. good. we have the perfect mate for you. my darling sister, ophelia. bachelors. always playing hard to get. i didn't realize your sister was such a swinger. faster. faster. faster. ophelia, where are you. horatio. what have you done with the swing. i've got it right here, dear. my goodness. don't worry, dear. i'll catch you. that was fun. i just love it when you do things like that. i must save my poor deluded sister from the clutches of that beast. right. she's deluded enough without him. but i love horatio. the man's a bounder and a cad. and not a very nice one. he's the only one that loves me. i know he loves me. the daisies told me so. ophelia. are you going to listen to the daisies or to mama. what do you see. i see a man with a heidelberg scar and a bushy mustache. that's the blackguard. mama, tell ophelia the truth about this man. he's loaded, elegant and unattached. and if you ask me, he'd make ophelia a perfect husband. mama, either you're out of practice or that ball needs repairing. that scoundrel must have tampered with it. very well then. get your own crystal ball. the cleverness of the fiend. even fooling mama. oh, shame, shame. to pillory that poor man with your outrageous slings and arrows. oh, horatio, my love. i'm coming. you're going the wrong way, dear. he's upstairs in uncle fester's room. flying to her destruction like a moth to a flame. what do we do. blow out the flame. this is fun. ophelia. locking yourself up this way isn't going to solve the problem. i'm going to stay in here until i perish. but, darling, what good would you be to horatio dead. interesting point. ophelia, the man is not only a scoundrel, he doesn't even have a job. but, darling, you don't have a job, either. exactly, one playboy in the family is enough. besides, he's a liar, claims to have been at heidelberg. should be easy enough to disprove that. well, of course. we'll simply call the heidelberg dean of men. not necessary. all heidelbergers are expert swordsmen. i'll just get down the sabers and test this blowhard. hope you don't mind a friendly exchange of steel, bartholomew. not at all. you'll forgive me if i'm a bit rusty. rusty, eh. you beginning to get the drift, ophelia. all right, choose your weapons. now, the moment lurch drops his handkerchief, we begin. just a minute, old boy. let's wait till the handkerchief hits the floor. sorry. whenever you're ready. bravo, gomez. wonderful evasive action. now all i have to do is evade the furniture. allow me. none of your trickery here, old man. sorry, bruno. would you like to wrestle. you were magnificent, dear. where did the coward go. upstairs, to wash the blood off his hands. blood on his hands, eh. your blood. now will you help horatio and me plot our troth. really, ophelia. would you marry a penniless imposter. penniless. horatio. you'll soon laugh on the other side of your daisies. are we going to call brad and dunstreet again. there are other ways to unmask a braggart. braggart, come down here and bring some money. darling, don't you think you'd better let mr. bartholomew cut the cards. too risky. excuse me, it's time to feed cleopatra. on with the game, bartholomew. horatio, pick a daisy for luck. that one must have taken root. try another. my love. well, what about $200, just for openers. i should go out. nothing like hard cash on the line to weed out the ribbon clerks. however, just for sociability, i'll see your $200 and raise you $200. just as i thought. phony. that bill is yours. strange. uncle fester's picture is on there. i told him to keep his monopoly money out of this drawer. all right. here's that $200, your $200, and $500 more. raise him back, horatio. raise him back. if it will amuse you, dear. your $500, and i'll raise you $500. that is if you'll accept a check. i knew we'd get to the check ploy. we're playing for cash, bartholomew, not paper. very well, then. i'll raise you $100. all right, ribbon clerk. what do you have. a pair of deuces. deuces. that's good. i thought you were bluffing. still, he isn't exactly penniless. so he carried a few extra kopecks around in his pocket. tactic number one in the fortuneseekers' manual. darling, you know so much about the world. i've lived in it all my life. still, it grieves me to see that sweet, charming creature in the clutches of that abominable monster. gomez. dear horatio decided he didn't want the money he won from you. maybe we misjudged the monster. he gave it all away. blackguard. probably leave you for the first pretty ankle that comes along. fiddledeedee. prove it. gomez can't, but i can. morticia. don't worry, darling. i'll lead him to the brink and stop him at the gate. it'll do you no good. i'm the blonde. and i'm more fun. yes, i am. did you want to see me about something. not something. us. gomez and ophelia have gone out. we're all alone. just the two of us, together. care to play checkers. oh, what a tight leash you have on your passions, dear. come, sit beside me. if he lays a hand on her, i'll kill him. and give him a piece of my mind, too. wouldn't you be more comfortable here. i'm quite all right here. that's better. when you first entered this house, you must have felt the vibrations. true, i have. but it's an old house. it's bound to have a few vibrations. horatio, why do you resist me. because i'm in love with your sister. excuses, excuses. take me. take you where. i knew you couldn't resist me. mrs. addams, you're beautiful, charming, cultured, talented, intelligent, witty, rich and completely feminine. you're just not my type. not your type. how dare you insult my wife. so you've been watching. this entire day has been nothing but a silly test. i love you for what you are. whatever that is. and i love you for what you are. whatever that is. thank you, thing. hello. morticia addams speaking. oh, yes. just a moment. gomez, dear. it's brad and dunstreet calling back about mr. bartholomew. hello, mr. dunstreet. sorry. hello, mr. brad. really. yes, i see. yes, that is interesting. thank you. nailed him as a draft dodger, too, eh. seems there's been a slight mistake. they were checking out a mr. henry bartholomew. who's he. a fraud, a forger, and a draft dodger. henry bartholomew is definitely out. what about horatio. well, he's not the richest man in the world. he's the second richest man in the world. we'll apologize to him forthwith. mr. bartholomew, i'm afraid we owe you an apology. yes, indeed, bartholomew, old man. we've misjudged you. oh, well. you're not only acceptable to this family, i'm going to see to it that you're a fullfledged member of the zenyogi society. zenyogi. the only true way to inner peace. ridiculous. ridiculous. some of the men in our family, the frump family, have found inner peace swinging from a chandelier. absurd. absurd. perhaps you'd prefer a simple romp in the swamp. nonsense. nonsense. but, horatio, a man who doesn't like to stand on his head or swing from a chandelier or have a simple romp in the swamp is maladjusted. lucky me. lucky me, for finding out in time. ophelia, he's the second richest man in the world. my mother taught me never to settle for second best. a true frump. it will take a long time for my wounds to heal. but i'll get over it. you mean it. you really want to marry ophelia. you dear, sweet, lovable creature. that ophelia. a oneman woman. darling, are you sure you know how to saw a woman in half. positive. it's putting her together again i'm not sure of. mail's in. thank you, thing. oh, it's from ophelia. oh, she says she and itt had a lovers' quarrel, and the engagement is off. but she's found a new love. i like a girl who can bounce back. what's he like. well, she says he's not only rich, charming and handsome, but he also claims to be napoleon. napoleon. sounds like the perfect match. )
