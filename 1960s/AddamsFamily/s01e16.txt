could get killed deader than a herring. in that case, you'd be buried with full military honors. mr. hollister, you make it sound so appealing. oh, no, now just a minute. look, with these walkytalkies, we'll be in constant contact. now if anything should happen, all you have to do is holler. yeah, if it's not too late. nothing like the minuet to strengthen the wrist. yes, it firms all

flipped your wig. very busy. very busy down there. are they really. morticia, may i see you privately for a moment, please. i'll go. i'll go. no, no, mr. conkey. you stay right here and plumb. he's behaving even more strangely than the mailman. yes. he seems very flighty for a plumber. if he is a plumber. come in, hollister, this is conkey. hollister: conkey, where are you now. i'm bailing out. you can't leave now. you gotta stay. i'm staying. i'm staying. i hate to bother you, old man, but there's something we have to check on. yes. we don't mean to be rude, but could we see your union card. i still think you should have thrown him out. how could we. his union card was above reproach. morticia, i don't feel safe with a nut like that running around the house. forget the plumber. i've got to get through to winthrop in sumbawanga. darling, is it so urgent. absolutely. i must tell him not to mix the plutonium with the uranium shipments. otherwise they'll never get here. boy, that'd really knock the coconuts off the trees. fester, you've got to give me more power. i'll try. addams calling winthrop. addams calling winthrop. conkey: conkey calling hollister. conkey calling hollister. darling, you're on a party line. hollister on radlo: this is hollister. come in. hollister, i need help. lots of help. isn't that nice. mr. conkey's finally contacted plumbing central.

around, conkey. your job is to find that communication center. conkey: my job is to find a way out of here. i got a secret door. well, go in then. go in. say, conkey. maybe it's the radio room. that's right. it is. conkey, just what are you doing. i'm leaving. morticia, there's skullduggery going on in this house. that's right. you're letting all kinds of kooks in here. darling, with your vast international interests, we can't afford to be too careful. i think we should call the authorities. good thinking, my dear. this is a job for lntelligence. well, don't look at me. i got to go get recharged. i have it. i'll call the cio. querida mia, not the cio, cla. whatever you say, dear. i'll call washington. they'll put us in touch with the proper authorities. very good thinking, dear. intrigue. very intriguing. well, you did your best, conkey. thanks anyway. well, who pays the bill. 18 bucks. and one pair of lionbit pants. what are they saying, morticia. i spoke to the headman in washington, who put me in touch with the regional director, who then put me in touch with the local director, who is now trying to connect me to the special agent in the field. you start at the top, you get action. i wouldn't worry about your breeches, conkey. the government's good for them. excuse me. yes. who. mrs. addams. some strange things have been going on in this house. and we feel you ought to know about them. dear special agent, of course we're ready to talk. now just don't move a muscle, mrs. addams, i'll be right in. over. conkey, i don't know what you did, but they are ready to confess. well, in case you need anything, conkey plumbing is out of business. follow me. badge number 13. what a lovely coincidence. the same number as my perfume. perfume. yes. quagmire number 13. mrs. addams, i don't think you quite realize the serious situation that you're in. oh, but i do. that's why we sent for you. naturally. of course, we don't like to implicate other people. then you do admit there are other people involved. of course. let's see. there is briggs, the postman. and mr. conkey, the plumber. oh, please, mrs. addams, i planted those people here myself. you did. then you must be involved in the ring. gomez: i'd say he's the head of the ring. i'm gonna have to make a citizen's arrest. what do you mean, darling. what if he isn't a citizen. now, look here. of course i'm a citizen. good. then it's legal. you rang. lurch, disarm this traitor and throw him in the lockup. mrs. addams, i appeal to you. this is no time here. just a minute. i work for the government. hey, kid, get me out of here, will you. i can't. my father said you're to stay right there. look, would you get me out if i gave you a pair of genuine undercover man's handcuffs. no. i already got a pair from a regular cop that was here once. oh, it's time for me to send a message. calling anthony in poland. this is cleopatra, the maneating plant. the thing is ready. repeat. the thing is ready. darn it. the set's gone dead. do you mean to say that you're the one who's been making all these mystery calls. when we grow up we're all going to meet in bulgaria and fight the gypsies from outer space. oh, my god. the chief will never believe this. well, old man. we owe you an apology. yes, we called washington and we found out you really are an undercover man. i am. of course you are. buck up, old man. there's lots of work to be done. mortlcla: of course there is. if it weren't for people like you, what would happen to people like us. i don't know. but why didn't it happen before i got here. do have lurch give you back your pistol. see, my dear. these old heirlooms come in handy. they certainly do, darling. why, do you know three years ago, i almost gave this away to the salvation army. darn nice of ahmed ben pasha to send us this turkish hookah. does wonders for togetherness. mail's in. thank you, thing. there's 20 cents postage due. i wonder why mr. briggs didn't come in and get his money. he never does anymore. we must owe that man a fortune. i notice it's from a rest home. it says, "thank you. if it weren't for you people, i wouldn't be here. " it's signed p. j. hollister. i like a man who isn't too proud to be grateful. yes. and it does make you thankful that our government men are so clever. dear mr. hollister. we should send him something. i have it. some of mama's candied porcupine. the simple things are the best. )
