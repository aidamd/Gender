do. how do you're pinched. fine beginning. don't fret, mama. you'll have the greatest legal brains defending you since clarence darrow. but, darling, i haven't practiced in years. this will be excellent practice for you. you're right. first thing we'll do is obtain an injunction. an injunction for what. oh, i'll think of something. doesn't hurt to have one handy. are you ready, madame

lieutenant's. very clever. i'm not sure it'll work. why not. politics. oh, that's true. i'll have the law declared unconstitutional. lieutenant poston's 3340 will be erased from the statutes. brilliant, darling, absolutely brilliant. but didn't lieutenant poston say that law was 4330. or was it 3340. maybe it was 300000. i'll have them all declared unconstitutional. can't be too careful, you know. darling, it's so reassuring to have mama's defense in your hands. well, they didn't call me "the loophole" for nothing. no, the name fits you perfectly. i'm worried about one thing. worried. cara mia. about what. i don't know what to wear to court. hey, let me out of here. let me out of here. mama, you poor darling, what are they doing to you. nothing. i saw this cupbanging scene in a

release me. now keep moving, keep moving. madame bovary. welcome, dear. you made it just as i predicted. i told you she's fabulous. what happened. well, i was crossing a street in the middle of the block and an officer had the nerve to give me a ticket. so naturally i kicked him. just bear with it. my husband will take your case as soon as he frees mama. oh, is your husband a lawyer. he's the great loophole. look, mister, i don't make the laws. just pay the $10 fine and you can have her out in five minutes. i'm afraid i couldn't do that. it wouldn't give mama time enough to do her famous mess hall scene. she just loves prison pictures. look, i might even get the judge to reduce the fine. oh, it's not a matter of money, it's a question of principle. just what do you want. i demand an immediate trial, complete acquittal, and a full apology. well, chum, you sure picked the right judge for that. first case.
