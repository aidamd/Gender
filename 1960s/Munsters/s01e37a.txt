'cause i know my soninlaw. you're a hardluck guy. if you found the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, there'd be a tax collector sitting on the lid. what am i gonna tell lily. she's been counting on a raise, and if she finds out i've been fired, she might get mad at me and stamp on the floor and say mean things to me and shake her finger at me. she might even break my huckleberry hound records. now listen, herman, you're a grown man, and you're going to handle this in an adult manner. you're gonna do what every redblooded american husband does in a case like this. don't tell your wife a thing. well, herman, all through dinner you haven't said a word about what happened at the parlor today.  oh, uh, we were quite busy. in fact, we had a quite a turnover.  i mean about your interview with mr. gateman. oh, that. we're so anxious, uncle herman. did he talk to you. oh, yes, he, uh, talked to me. well, is he going to give you a raise or isn't he. well, you see, dear, mr. gateman is a rather busy man. i think he wants to take the idea and sort of, uh, throw it down the well. throw it down the well. you know, throw it down the well and see if anyone salutes it. what kind of doubletalk is that. well, you know, lily, he wants to take the idea and run it up the flagpole and see if it makes a splash. all businessmen have expressions like that to keep outsiders from finding out that they really don't know what they're talking about. well, i think mr. gateman is giving you the runaround. he may want to think it over, but i want an answer by the end of the week. well, i think you'll have an answer by the end of the week if not sooner. marilyn, eddie, come and help me take out the dishes. whew. boy, herman, that was close. but at least you've got till the end of the week. i'll tell you what, grandpa. i figure i'll leave the house every day as if i was going to the parlor and not break the news to lily until i get a new job. oh, i see. you wanna keep the news from her as long as you can. right. as we say in business, let's not start scratching till we know where the fleas are biting.     well, here i go. off to bring home the bacon.  of course, i've always been a hog for work.  herman, it's been a week since you spoke to mr. gateman. do you think i'll have a little surprise tonight when i open your pay envelope. oh, yes, i think you'll have quite a surprise. oh, i just know it's going to be a real nice, big raise. well, mr. gateman should appreciate all the hard work you've done. after all, anyone with his experience and all his years in the business should recognize a live one when he sees one. well, yes, dear. uh, goodbye. i'll see you later tonight.   well, marilyn, we could certainly use a little extra money around here. for one thing, eddie needs a new cover for his bed. the old one is getting so warped, he can hardly close it at bedtime. hey, mom. . mom. . pop went off to work without his lunch box. oh, dear. well, thank you, eddie. now go back to the kitchen and finish your breakfast. would you like me to drop it off on my way to class. no, marilyn. i'll just call the parlor, leave a message for herman with mr. gateman. oh, uh, uncle herman could eat in a restaurant today. he says there's one around the corner that usually empties out whenever he gets there. hello. gateman, goodbury and graves. this is mrs. herman munster. i'd like to leave a message for my husband. you see, he he what. when. are you sure. well i see. well, thank you very much. aunt lily, what happened. all the color's rushed into your face. what happened. herman's going to work every morning this week has been a fraud. the big goofball got fired last monday. what i want to know is what's herman been doing this past week after he left the house every morning. he's been out looking for work. he's had five jobs in five days. you can't ask for a better record than that. he's a perfect failure. i'm sure, mr. tom fong, sir, if you'd consider hiring me, i'd live up to all your expectations. i advertised "boy wanted.
