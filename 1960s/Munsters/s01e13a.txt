"mr. munster polishing his car. this fascinating shot was taken at a great personal risk in a cockpit of a speeding power mower. " look. stop playing the bigshot war correspondent, will ya. the boss is right. these are real people downtoearth, heartland stuff. why, i might even get a pulitzer prize out of this. why don't you knock it off, len. you sound like chester morris on the late, late, late show. grandpa. uh, grandpa. oh, grandpa. i can't imagine where he is. he knows the reporters are coming this afternoon. i guess he's gone somewhere, but the question is when'll he come back.  nevermore. will you stay out of this. uncle herman, i think he's trying to tell us something.  "dear mr. and mrs. average, igor and i have flown the coop. sorry we can't be there for the picturetaking. grandpa. '"  and he promised me he wouldn't leave the house. why, when those men show up and find that one of our statistics is missing, he's liable to call the whole deal off. now we'll lose the prize money. oh, and we were so looking forward to that vacation cruise on the dead sea. fiddlesticks.  now, herman. listen. the people from the magazine won't be here for a while. maybe you can find grandpa before they get here. yes. and i know all his haunts. now, when those men come here, marilyn, you show them to their room and make some excuse for us. don't worry about a thing. you just go out and find grandpa. right. we'll check all the places where he hangs out. come come, lily. don't tell me this is it. well, the place where we rented the car said this was the street. there's the number: 1313. house beautiful it ain't. i've seen direct hits that looked better than this. let's go see if ma and pa kettle are home.    hey, chip, let's call the home office. something's wrong here. i don't see anything very average about this. neither do i. miss munster. i'm marilyn munster. you must be the men from event magazine. yes. right, right. chipjohnson. lennie bates. words. pictures. how you doin'. won't you come in, please. thank you. are you in a hurry to start taking pictures. oh, no. no need to get down to business so soon. good. then i'll show you to your room. i suppose you're wondering where the rest of the family is. frankly, it hadn't even entered my head. well, they'll be back soon. "be back soon. " what a doll. maybe grandpa got hungry. sometimes he comes here to grab a bite. you wait here. i'll see if he's in there.  was grandpa in there. no. the place is empty. they must serve terrible food. well, let's keep looking. grandpa goes down here once in a while to enjoy the damp earth. i'll see if he's down there. grandpa. oh, grandpa.  he ain't here. okay. okay. s'all right. s'all right. grandpa sometimes comes here to feed the wolves. i tell you, mr. morgan. this place is weird. i think we oughta call it off. research must have goofed this one. nonsense. our computers are never wrong. they're infallible. why, they picked my last three wives for me. all right. so so the place is a little rundown. i mean, what do you what do you expect the average family to live in. huh. the taj mahal. hey. we met the niece. she's a doll. now, the rest of the family's gotta be great.  well, you don't get candy apples off a lemon tree. look, you boys come back here with a story, and check it all out. make sure that family satisfies our computer to a "t.

"early san quentin".  chip. . oh, there's the reprieve from the governor. well, don't go away, doll. i'll be right back. well, i think i'll say good night now, but i'll see you in the morning. okay.  good night. what do you want. i was just beginning to soften her up. chip, there's something awfully wrong here. a man got onto this thing and then turned into a suit of armor.  i suppose the next thing you're gonna tell me is you saw little men. well, i was afraid to mention it before, but when we first came in, i did see one run across the hall and then later, he ran up the stairs. my boy, you need a good night's rest. it's discouraging, herman. grandpa is just nowhere around. i know. how many places are there in a town like this where a man can bury himself. when i think of losing that $5,000, it makes me so mad i could blow my top. well, don't do that, dear. it's always so messy. what are you doin' with the binoculars. no, thank you. now, put that away, will you. no wonder you've been seeing little men. now, come on. let's go to bed. we don't wanna look like a couple of weirdos when we meet the rest of the family, hmm. put it away.   chip. chip. chip, wake up. huh. huh. what's the matter. what's the matter. there's a monster in the hall. lennie, ya big dope, will you stay out of the binoculars. i saw it. i swear it. he's about seven foot tall, and his head is bolted to his neck, and he's wearing a nightshirt. i saw it. come on. i swear. i swear. come on. all right. all right. let go.  isn't it awful. it's frightening. but it was there. i'm gonna take you to a psychiatrist. chip, i swear it. i saw it. i swear i saw it. if you weren't dreaming, what were you doing at the door in the first place. i was going to get a glass of water. well, the big, bad bogeyman's gone. go get your water. eddie, are you in bed.  yes, but i can't stay awake. you'll be able to. just lie there with your eyes open, dear.  i'm getting out of here. now, look here. what do you wanna do. get us both fired. i'll tell ya what i'll do. wait a minute. i'll tell you what i'll do. we'll go through the whole house together.  no. i'll prove to you that there's nothing here but a gorgeous creature named marilyn and her harmless, average american family. okay. i'll be with you every minute. okay. come on. gee, you certainly go through an awful lot, lily, to make yourself beautiful just to go to bed. anything for you, pussycat.  did you hear that. hmm. it's downstairs. oh. good. it's burglars. herman, you go down and have a look. do i have to. of course. go down and scare them off. me. scare them off. how. herman. all right. just a moment. oh, will you hurry. all right. just let me see if it's loaded. come on. i'm going. i'm going.  it's a little far out, but you don't see any monsters, do you.  so far. i'm sure i heard footsteps. let's look in there.  you see, there's nothing unusual in here, right. hey, look. aww. nice kitty.  careful. looks like an electric chair. let's get out of here. it might be plugged in. well, you gotta admit we didn't find anything, right.  hmm. i guess you're right.  what's that. it's just our own footsteps, ya dope. our own footsteps, huh. then how come they're still walkin'. we'll look back together. shh. see, ya big dope. you got me doin' it now. it's just your imagination.   help. grandpa.  it's me, chip.  herman. no. not grandpa. the burglars.   it's me. ohh. ohh.  aunt lily, uncle herman, what happened. there were burglars in the house, dear. we just chased them off.  burglars. those were the two men from event magazine. oh, bats. there goes our $5,000, herman. well, i guess there's only one thing to do. oh, darn. i forgot.   but, boss, they are monsters. yeah, yeah. i saw them. it was horrible. look. you boys have been at that binocular case too much. now, you get back there and get that picture, or you're both fired. well, you heard the man. back we go.  four lenses cracked before i got it. i finally used the strongest one we had, the one for elephant stampedes. it's magnificent. hmm. what. look, we have shown the average american family celebrating new year's, christmas, mother's day, the fourth ofjuly and susan b. anthony's birthday, but this is the first time we have ever shown the average american family celebrating halloween. boys, you are brilliant. send a check to the munsters and pick up a $1,000 bonus from the cashier. and congratulations.   isn't it a beautiful picture, herman. mm. yeah, but but look what it says here: "america's average family celebrates halloween.
