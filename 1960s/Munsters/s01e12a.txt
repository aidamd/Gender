grgrandpa, i won't stand for it. it's a terrible thing to do. it's downright murder. herman, i know it could be a disaster, but i think we ought to let grandpa go through with his experiment. herman, i just wanna fill your gas tank with water. but it's crazy trying to turn water into gasoline with a pill. uh, uh you'll ruin my beautiful car. herman, why don't we humor him. last time we did, he invented athlete's foot. oh. i forgot about that. uh, uh go ahead, grandpa. and now for my "instant gasoline" pill.  what's it doing. never mind that, herman. just get in and start 'er up. grandpa, it'll never work.  oh, herman, don't be such a doubting thomas.    grandpa, you're a genius. naturally.     grandpa, i drove all the way around the block.   what kept you. grandpa. you're not writing crank letters to "dear abby" again. no, of course not. i'm sending a sample of my "instant gasoline" pill to the reliable oil company. ho ho. boy, when they buy my invention, we'll all be millionaires. well, we could certainly use some money. i'd like to carpet the dungeon in walltowall moss and get some new lightning rods for the house. i think you're being very selfish. you should stop thinking of yourself and share your invention with mankind. i am gonna share it, 5050. they get the pill. i get the money. now, really.  oh, marilyn. oh, my. those circles under your eyes how lovely you look today. well, i wish i felt as well as i look. i just haven't been able to sleep for the last two nights. have you tried hanging from the rafters with your head down like i do. i'd like to, grandpa, but i just don't seem to have the toes for it. well, i'll go down to the lab later, and i'll mix you up something. um, uh, all right, but be careful. i don't trust those homemade remedies of yours.  the last time, you invented a medicine for which there was no disease. i'm not kidding, mr. hadley. according to the old gentleman's letter, he's found a way to turn water into gasoline. i know you're not kidding, dick, but that's one of the oldest wheezes in the oil business. sir, look. i'll drop this pill into this pan of water. now, smell it.  sure, it smells like gasoline. a lot of them do. but that's as far as it goes. now, don't waste your time with him. he's just an old crackpot. yeah, i guess you're right.  wwwell, don't just stand there. like i said, go get that old genius signed up.   let me see. two parts monassium contabinate. two parts. now, herman, please. i'm working on my "instant gasoline" formula. boy. if louis pasteur had had you looking over his shoulder, i'm sure he never would have invented rabies. uh, uh you could use some advice from me.  i hung around labs long before i was born. hi, grandpa. you haven't come across a cure for insomnia, have you. no. i'm sorry. i've been busy working on my gas pill. are you still having trouble getting to sleep, dear. i didn't sleep a wink last night. i'll tell you what, marilyn. now you just sit right down here, and i'll put you to sleep with my hypnotism. i'm very good at that, you know. now you just concentrate on my watch, all right. now look at the watch and concentrate. abracadabra, hop toad pie, look your grandpa in the eye. when your grandpa counts to three, fast asleep you're going to be. one, two, three.  oh, well. there's a wise guy in every crowd. don't worry, marilyn. i'll mix you a sleeping potion. now, let me see. where are the recipes. grandpa, it's a telegram from the oil company. they're sending a man tomorrow to discuss your invention with you. tomorrow. that's fine. i'll have a batch of my "instant gasoline" pills ready by then. but what about my insomnia. don't worry, marilyn. i'll make you a sleeping potion at the same time. grandpa, are you sure you know what you're doing. now, lily, please. don't tell a mad scientist how to run his business. herman. herman, you get up.  i wish you wouldn't take naps down here. you know i like to keep a neat dungeon. uh, yes, dear.    grandpa and his experiments. why couldn't i have had a normal fatherinlaw who goes to church at night and plays bingo. oh, calm down, herman. so he blows up the house once in a while. he just wants to feel needed. besides, he has to get those gasoline pills made, and he has to find a sleeping potion for marilyn. oh, marilyn, dear. why are you up so late. i just can't get to sleep. i'm going to see if grandpa's made me the sleeping potion yet. i'm just dead on my feet. isn't everybody. ah. this is the thing i've been looking for. grandpa.   marilyn. don't ever do that. you'll scare me right out of my skin, and you know how hard it is to get back into it. i'm sorry, grandpa, but i've got to have that sleeping potion. oh, don't worry. i've got it all ready.   let me see aha. here it is. no, no. that's not it either.  no, no. ah. here it is.  i'll put a head on it for you.   heh. bottoms up. courage. thank you, grandpa, but i don't feel a thing. i'm still as wide awake as    nightynight.  good morning, lily. good morning, dear. oh, my. you look positively green around the gills. oh, thank you. good morning, mom. good morning, pop. good morning, eddie. good morning, family. good morning. good morning, grandpa. uh, say, has marilyn come up yet. no, no. she's asleep in the lab still. eddie, you'd better go down and wake her up. she'll be late for class. okay. oh, he's such a good boy. yes, but i wish he'd learn to be neater. i keep telling him over and over again not to leave these empty pet food cans around after he's fed spot. he leaves them all over the place.  grandpa, how's the gasoline pill going. the man from the oil company's coming today. i got a little sidetracked making a sleeping potion for marilyn, but i'll have those pills ready in time.  you know, grandpa, your invention may revolutionize motoring. instead of gasoline, we may all need credit cards to buy water.  mom. dad. marilyn won't wake up. what. i shook her, but she just lies there. oh, dear.  hurry.  well, grandpa, just don't stand there. do something. that's it, all right. what do you mean. well, i got a little confused. i must have given her the sleeping beauty potion by mistake. oh. that means she'll sleep forever. no, no. the spell can be broken. to wake this sleeping beauty, you must remember this. to break the spell of slumber, a prince her lips must kiss.   oh, my. that's the front door. grandpa, you'd better do something fast. but, grandpa, whwhwhere are we ever gonna get a handsome prince to kiss marilyn. oh, where are we gonna get a handsome prince, period.   mrs. munster. yes. i'm, uh i'm the reliable oil company. li mean i'm from the reliable oil company, andand i have some business i'd like to discuss with your father. oh, i'm sorry, but he's terribly busy right now. could you come back later. you see, it's a family problem, a domestic crisis. oh, couldn't i just speak to him for a minute.  i'm terribly sorry, but it's out of the question right now. you come back later, all right. i have to get back to the dungeon. yes, of course. "the dungeon".  if you'd just keep your files straight, grandpa, this never would have happened. you're right, herman. i've done a terrible thing to marilyn. you shouldn't have kept that stupid sleeping beauty formula around in the first place. it's too dangerous. i'll get rid of it right now. good. where is it. oh. ha ha. there it is. oh. i'll take care of this right now.  good riddance. then what's this. oh, this. oh, no. this is the sleeping beauty formula. then, uh, then what i burned the formula for instant gasoline. grandpa, you are the world's oldest goofball. domestic crisis. why, dick, boy, they're just stalling. what kind of domestic crisis. i don't know exactly, sir. it's kind of strange over there thatthat house and everything. well, all these geniuses are a little odd. why would they want to stall me off. they probably want to get some offers from some of the other oil companies. and play one bid off against the other. exactly. and that means we've got to act fast. dick, i want you to get back there, get that slippery old fox signed up. i don't care what you go through. just sign him up. yes, sir. dick. if you come back with that contract, it means a vice presidency. a vice presidency. yes, sir. and remember, dick, the honor and integrity of the reliable oil company is at stake. so get that contract by hook or crook. yes, sir.  nah. duds, every one of'em. not a prince in the whole bunch.    hmm. they just don't make frogs the way they used to in transylvania. grandpa. you and your oldworld methods. hah. lily and i are going about it the modern, sensible way. oh. and, uh, what is the "modern, sensible way" to find the prince. look in the yellow pages. no. we put an ad in the newspaper. oh. uh, listen to this.
