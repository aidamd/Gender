uh, igor.  igor. igor, will you hold this a second. dropped it again. butterclaws.   are you feeling any better, herman. well, uh, uh, my headache's gone. but my sinuses are killing me. oh, and, uh, grandpa. this draft down here isn't helping any either.  don't be ridiculous. how can there be a draft mr. pike, this is the property in question right here. belongs to a family named munster. they're some kind of holdout. well, we've only got 60 feet to go for the two pipelines to connect. juncturewise, that is. so, harkness, get somebody over there to secure the rightofway. well, we sentjohnson over, b. t. , but, uh, he didn't come back. well, get him on the phone. i tried to, b. t. , but the doctor at the sanitarium said there are no phones in the padded rooms. that's what you get for hiring a neurotic. if i don't get this pipeline completed on schedule, the mayor and the city council are going to have my head on a platter. i'll tell you what you do: put the pipeline under the munster's house. we don't even need to tell 'em about it. go down about 25 feet. that should do it. i don't know, b. t. we could be in trouble. borden t. pike laughs at trouble.  i don't intend to be intimidated by the munsters. besides, what kind of trouble would we run into 25 feet underground. uh, that stuff you gave me yesterday didn't work at all. uh, have you got anyanything else. i'll be right  back. stay right here. don't go 'way. now, now, now. where did i put that stuff. no, no, no, no. that's not what i'm looking for. and besides, i thought i told you to wait in the washing machine. uh, this isn't gonna hurt, is it.  don't be such a baby, herman.    ahh.       and you expect me to believe a ridiculous story like that. horrible creatures, bats flying around scare tactics, pure and simple. they tried tojack up the price by putting on those ridiculous disguises. well, i know itit sounds ridiculous, but that's the way this fellow reported the story to me. nonsense. he just doesn't want to assume the responsibility for having broken into that cellar. but sir, we never expected anyone to have a cellar that deep. no excuses. now, get out of here. and don't come back until you get a haircut. yes, sir. all right, harkness. i'll handle this myself. fanny, dear, i called to tell you that i won't be home for supper tonight. i have a very important business engagement across town. all right. who is she. fanny, i'm not seeing a woman. yes, i did have lunch with a woman. it was my mother. fanny, stop being so jealous. i can't help it if my mother was a woman. it could happen to anybody. all right. i'll speak to her about it.  yes, dear.  yes, dear.  yes, dear. i'll show those munsters that borden t. pike will not be intimidated.    spotty. get away from the door. get away. eddie. come and get spot and put him in the kitchen this instant. i'm terribly sorry, but spotty gets so excited when we have visitors. won't you come in. i'll come in, but remember i'm not easily taken in. may i have your hat, mr. , uh pike. borden t. pike. city gas. come right in, mr. pike. i'm herman munster. this is my fatherinlaw, the count. it's a pleasure to meet you. uh, won't you have a seat.  now, we realized you were inconvenienced. we're prepared to compensate you for the damage why, hello there. for the damage done to your basement. in addition to which, we will pay you, uh, fifteen  uh, $1,500 for the continuance of the rightofway through your property. that is my final offer. $1,500. that would come in very handy for a sunny day. boy, how much is that in cheese. uh, eddie. you've been told before. don't play with that mousetrap. the mice will never go near it now. uh, well, mr. pike. it sounds like a good deal to me. oh, good. i'm against it. the idea of sneaking a gas main under our property. thank you. i urge you to accept my offer. it will be good for your neighbors and friends. the entire community will benefit from the pipeline. well, li would say, if it's good for the community, we have to accept. i think we should take herman's advice. after all, he's always been the levelheaded one of the family. i want no part of it. i don't like the idea of anybody digging on the premises. there's no telling who they'll come up with. i urge you to accept my offer. and don't think you're gonna get me to raise it, because i don't scare easy.  mr. pike. wait. this is my house, and it's gonna be my way. uh, li agree with lily. we accept. eddie. my boy. i want you to be a witness to my degradation. now someday, you'll have creatures of your own. you'll know what to expect.   this is what you want. this is what you'll get. if you want me, i'll be in my room.  good night.   oh, grandpa. uh, you'll have to excuse grandpa, mr. pike. you know how old people  mr. pike. mr. pike.   ow. . ow. boy. i told him to keep his big trap shut. eddie. i don't care what grandpa says. i'm gonna go call mr. pike right now and tell him we accept. after all, we can't always think of ourselves. wwe have to think of our neighbors too. herman, you certainly have a good heart. best money can buy. eddie.  hello. uh, mr. munster.  yes, this is mr. pike. oh, oh,

herman, i don't want you going out. you've already had a sinus attack today. and you're not looking well. ooh, you've even got color in your cheeks. really. oh. well, um, maybe you're right. l my sinuses have been acting up. well, they were probably worn out when you got them. grandpa. are you going to hang around here sulking all night. why don't you go to your room. hmm. why should i.

would like to boil that mr. pike in oil. but no. you had to give away my cookbook to the goodwill. okay. okay. don't worry about it. i'll handle this myself. the nerve of those people. it makes me furious. herman, don't lose your head. i'mi'm gonna go call that mr. pike right now. that's right, dear. don't be afraid. you just show him who you're made of.  pike. this is herman munster. never mind that. you can't treat my niece that way. oh, yeah. usually, i'm not a violent man. but i'm coming over there right now and punch you in the nose. fanny. fa fanny. yes. who was that at the door a few minutes ago. huh. as if you didn't know. it's that snippy little blonde of yours, that marilyn munster, or whatever her name is. oh, that's what he meant. her uncle is on his way here now. he's
