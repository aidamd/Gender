you know, lily, it's very nice to relax after supper.  did you have a hard day at the parlor, dear. did i. people were in and out all day. eh, don't complain, herman. you should be grateful you've got a going business.  what is it you've got there, herman. popcorn. li thought i'd make some and sort of keep things jumping.  now you stay there, spot, and be a good boy.   hey, dad, i got a new record today. is it okay if i play it on the phonograph. why, of course, eddie. i think it's very nice for a young boy to be interested in music.  you know, eddie, back in the old country, you couldn't keep me away from good music. hmm. why, i used to haunt the opera house night and day. turn the horn around, eddie, so that we can all hear it. huh.       but, pop, they're the standells. every kid in school is crazy about 'em. and they're coming to town for a concert. boy, i'd give anything to meet 'em facetoface. whew, eddie  we can all be thankful that that will never happen. okay, okay, pops. so we're picking up 8,000 for a onenight stand in this town. we don't want to get stomped to death. yeah, that last hotel was too much with those 2,000 screaming kids in the lobby. look, why don't you rent us a mansion with a couple of swimming pools. like you did in beverly hills. you guys wrecked the last two places like that cost us $15,000 damages. well, then get us a place on the outskirts, one we can't hurt. hey, that's a good idea. right on. yeah. well, all right. all right. i've got a real estate agent working on it, and he's spotted a place. "1313 mockingbird lane. " it's owned by some people named, uh, "munster. " i'm going out there now and try to make a deal. yeah, when those munsters find out what we're willing to pay, they'll practically fall over dead. it's nice you're interested in our house, mr. murdock, but it simply isn't for rent. but it would be just right for these, uh, friends of mine. and i'm prepared to make a very attractive offer. oh, but my aunt and uncle are out right now, and grandfather's up in the attic. oh, uh, working. oh, no. he just likes to hang around up there. i only want to rent the place for my clients for the weekend. and we're prepared to pay $500. well, i really don't believe they'd consider renting it. are you sure you heard me right, miss. i said $1,500 for a weekend. oh, well, that's very generous, but they're very touchy about having strangers in the house. in all the years that we've lived here, i can't recall more than eight or nine people ever getting past the front door. yes. well, uh, you folks think it over. and have your aunt or uncle call me, huh. here's my card. oh, thank you. goodbye. goodbye. even my boys couldn't hurt this dump. this mr. murdock seemed very anxious to rent the place. but $1,500, just for the weekend.  must be some congressman here on government business. mmhmm. i don't think so. he called back three times. and he said he'd even put us all up at a hotel if we'd rent the place. but we don't even know who the man represents. li mean, what would the neighbors think if they saw a bunch of strangelooking people living in our home. grandpa, we could use the money. we still owe that bill to the vet from the last time you went out prowling aand caught distemper. grandpa, if you'd taken your shots when i told you to, you could have saved us $400. hey, mom, if we do rent the place, could i use some of the money to buy spot a new toy. oh, eddie, we gave him a foreign sports car for christmas. he played with it a couple of times, and then he threw it over the back fence. uncle herman, what should i tell the man if he calls back again. marilyn, dear, i've thought the thing over from all angles, and i have come to a conclusion. we will accept the man's offer. that is my decision as head of the house.   that's all right with you, isn't it, pussycat. oh, uh, lily, i'm gonna leave the key under the mat, dear, for our temporary tenants. we don't want any burglars getting in here. eh, herman, how are our tenants going to know that the key is under the mat. please, grandpa, i've taken care of everything. i hope those tenants don't ruin our beautiful yard. oh, dear, yes. it's taken us years to get it in this condition. lily, i've taken care of that too, dear. wait a minute. i forgot to say goodbye to spot.  goodbye, spot.  we're leaving now, spot.  now, you be a good boy while we're gone.  he's a good fellow, isn't he.   what is that. you got me. since when has the morgue been giving curb service. grandpa, lily, marilyn, you go on in and register. i'll park the car. there's a sign underground garage. underground. herman, let me go with you. i might run into a few old friends. no, grandpa. you go on in with the girls and keep an eye on them. there are lots of fresh traveling salesmen in hotel lobbies. may i. yeah, here.  what do you got in here. just my father's extra pair of shoes. hey, guys, what do you think of this coop. reminds me of the converted car barn we played in san francisco.  hey what was that. well, it was no swallow from capistrano. hey, look at this thing.   that's crazy, man. you can see the notes while you play 'em. hey, dig this lopsided "geetar. " wow. wow.   that's swing.  hey, guys, you know what. this calls for a party. that's a good idea. let's get on the horn and call us up some playmates. now you're talking. eh, say, uh, what's this thing. uh, that's the air conditioner, sir. well, turn it on. the air seems awfully fresh in here. yes, sir. hey, mom, can i go out and walk around the ledge. oh, no. no, eddie. you might fall off and hurt somebody. now you go right in, eddie, and get ready for bed.  no dust. and at these prices too.  uh, uh, grandpa, the bellboy is holding out his hand. what for. you're supposed to grease his palm. oh.  i'm sorry. where were you, herman. oh, lily, i had a terrible time parking. yeah. you know, i think this hotel is having labor trouble. just as i drove in their underground garage, the attendant quit. what kind of a dump is this. mom, i don't think i can sleep in that creepy bed. could i sleep in the dresser drawer. at least it has handles on it. we'll see, eddie. oh, herman, i
