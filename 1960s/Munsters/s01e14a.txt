perform for you one of the most amazing feats ever attempted in the annals of magic. here we have approaching an ordinary steamer trunk. now before your very eyes, i shall step into this trunk and allow these two gentlemen to lock,  chain and nail shut the lid of this trunk. and then at the count of 10, without the aid of any deathdefying leap, i shall emerge from this trunk unassisted.   remember, ladies and gentlemen, at the count of 10  unassisted. impresario. you are ready to commence the tabulation. ready. herman, i've never seen grandpa do this trick before. his magic's been
