could use some new faces around here. and, grandpa, i want you to be on your best behavior at supper. now, if you want the ketchup, would you mind not saying, "shoot me the plasma." okay, okay, but who's the guest. i promised eddie he could invite one of his little friends from school to spend the weekend with us.  oh. hi, everybody. this is googie miller. googie, this is my mom. hi. hello, googie. and this is my cousin marilyn. like wow. and this is my grandfather. hi. hi. what are you staring at, my little man. i never seen a penguin smokin' a cigar before. and this is my father.  put it there.  i gotcha that time. eddie. why don't you take your little friend upstairs until supper is ready. okay. come on, googie. so long, everyone. outgoing little fellow, isn't he. i don't think he's the ideal playmate for our sweet little eddie. well, marilyn, itit you know, it may be his parents' fault. perhaps that's the way he was brought up. brought up. i've seen better things brought up out of a swamp. shh. nevertheless, we're gonna make it a nice weekend for googie.  not me, charlie. i'm cuttin' out of here.  dinner's just about ready, herman. would you please blow out the candles. yes, dear. grandpa, would you call the boys. all right, lily. hey, googie. come on, googie. nice boy.  grandpa, what are you up to. well, lily, he has a hand buzzer. can't i pull a harmless little prank on him. put that thing away. oh, i never get to have any fun at all. boys, supper. oh, my. doesn't that look yummy. the boys will be down in a minute. now, i want everyone to make a special effort to be nice to eddie's little friend. but, aunt lily, he's so fresh. now, now, marilyn. being kind to people is like investing money in the bank. when we put kindness in, we get kindness back with interest. hi. sorry we're late, mom. oh, no, no, you're just in time. now, eddie, you sit over there, and, googie, you sit right here. allow me, mrs. munster. oh. well. may i. oh. oh, yes. sir. oh. thank you, son.  mr. banker, your investment just hit bottom. uncle herman. yes, dear. i really think you ought to take that little googie back to his parents. he's a very bad boy. i agree with marilyn. but gee, mom, he's the first kid i ever had stay over. a boy like that will disturb our normal routine.   oh, there's that spot begging for food again. i wish he'd stop that annoying scratching. last week, he ripped the back porch clean off. spot.  spot. now, spot, go away. spot, go away and stop stop scratching the door. go away. spot. where was i. oh, yes. i think we ought to let eddie's little friend stay. it was very nice of his parents to send him over. and i think it'll be most embarrassing if we take him back now. well, where's little googie now. he asked grandpa to show him the lab. they're down there. well, i think he ought to go home before he causes any more trouble. marilyn, please. i'm the head of this household, and if i say he stays, he stays. when i make a decision around here, it stands up.  herman, spot sounds awfully hungry. why don't you give him some of the scraps from the table. good idea, lily. spot, here you go.  i love to see an animal eat. it's very nice of you to show me around your wonderful laboratory, sir. oh, think nothing of it, son. and over here here i have my instant disguises. that's a very nice one you're wearing now, sir. yeah. and over here i'm working on a new cough medicine. just one teaspoon of this stuff and you'll cough for three days. oh, isn't that exciting. what's in that old chest there, sir. oh, that. that's my old army footlocker.  what are those. all us doughboys had our pinup pictures. and over here, googie, you see, these are the chemicals that i use in my experiments. oh, my. i bet you can make instant coffee and everything with those. yeah. what's in here. don't touch that. that's nitroglycerine.  there's enough in there to blow up the whole neighborhood. and right now, i'm working on an old formula. you see, i'm trying to turn a frog into a prince. could you change me into something. could i change you into something. i could change you into any kind of beast you could mention a horse, a crocodile, a unicorn, a rockandroll singer, a jackass i'll bet you couldn't even change me into a rabbit. a rabbit. that's my easiest trick. boy, you should catch me around easter. i turn out rabbits faster than rabbits turn out rabbits. i'll bet you can't. i'll bet i can. i'll bet you can't. look, googie, i'm too busy right now. but right after lunch, i'll prove it to you. i'll turn you
