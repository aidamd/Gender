ah. here we are. look at that bird. mother, you've outdone yourself this time. just put it down and let me get started on it. may we be truly thankful for what we're about to receive.  what does everybody want.    that tall, dark, handsomelooking fellow you're looking at is me. i guess you're wondering what's going on here. well, it all started about 10 days ago, when i was invited to a reunion of my old army outfit.  you can't do it. no matter how hard you try, it just won't fit. i don't understand it. it must have shrunk since i got out of the army.  were you a hero in the war, dad. well, i don't like to brag, eddie, but when i'd get up out of that foxhole, the enemy would take one look at me in this uniform and run. come to think of it, a lot of our guys used to look at me and run too. you can forget about wearing it to the reunion. it just doesn't fit. look. this is the first time in 20 years the guys from my old outfit are getting together. they're all gonna be wearing their uniforms at the banquet. how will it look if i'm the only guy to show up in civvies. they'll all stare at me. herman, i don't want you to go at all. i know what goes on at those socalled reunions. besides, if there's one thing you don't need, it's a banquet. just look at you. what's wrong with me. what's wrong. you're too fat. that's what's wrong. fat. me, fat. yeah. marilyn, i ask you am i too fat. well never mind. what are you yelling at marilyn for. i mean, don't you know that fat men are supposed to be jolly. that's not the issue. herman, if you go to that reunion, you'll be away overnight. lily herman, we haven't been separated in over a hundred years. but, lily, it's just one night. i know just the way lily feels. i felt the same way about grandma.  oh, she was quite a woman, your grandma. lily, i wanna go to the reunion. i wanna, i wanna. i wanna. all right, herman. i'll tell you what. the reunion is still if you can lose enough weight to get into your uniform by then, you can go. you got yourself a deal. i'll just stop eating. oh, no. no, no. you'll have to to go to a doctor and have a physical examination. get him to put you on a sensible diet. i don't want a sick corpse on my hands. okay. you've got yourself a deal.  what are my appointments today.  well, you have a new patient a mr. munster. he's here for a checkup. something about a diet. then you

uh, come in. i'm doctor dudley. how do you do. well, mr. munster, i see you brought your doggie. i'm afraid he'll have to wait outside unless he's had his shots. i'm afraid you don't understand. i'm here for an examination. i have some weight to lose in a hurry. oh, yes. you're the gentleman. who wants the diet. well, my nurse just took my glasses to be repaired, and, uh i could come back later. no need. no need. it's just a routine physical. i could do it blindfolded. now, if you just sit down over here, i'll look you over. now, stick out your tongue. doc. oh, there you are. you mustn't be afraid of me. now, have, uh, you ever had the measles. chicken pox. or the mumps. or severe dizziness or headaches. no. just the black plague. black plague. very funny. something wrong. no, no. that's

"dear mr. munster, "i have studied the results of your examination "and have reached the following conclusions: "your pulse is 15. your blood pressure is minus three. body temperature, 62. 8. and heartbeat, none. " so far, so good. "furthermore, it is my duty as a physician to warn you that unless you go on the enclosed diet and lose 100 pounds immediately, you'll be dead in a week. " but if i'm dead, i can't go to the reunion. well, i don't know. that never stopped me from going anywhere. i'm gonna lose a hundred pounds and go to the reunion in uniform even if it kills me. herman, lunch. i don't know how he's done it. six days on nothing but vitamins and water. i didn't think he'd really be able to stick to it this long. herman. hurry up. your lunch is getting cold. mmm. looks delicious. and what have we here. vitamins and water. oh, lily. oh. and a b12 too. lily, you shouldn't have gone to so much trouble. delicious. would you pass    i never knew you could get indigestion from water. has anybody got a toothpick. enough is enough. you win. go to the reunion. just don't wear your uniform. but please, eat something. no. now it's become a matter of principle. and besides, i've just got four more days to go. four more days. you'll never make it. never make it.   aha. grandpa. what are you doing hanging around down here. what am i doing.  what are you doing.

days to go, and i've got to get to that reunion. for your own good, take my advice. listen to someone whose head is not always in the clouds. eat something already. no. now it's become a matter of

know what you're talking about, doctor, but i do think you ought to examine him. all right. we'll have a look here. what are you doing, doctor. i hate to say this, but, uh, you called me a little too late. there's nothing more i can do. what do you mean. this is just a fainting spell. he's had these before. well, eight or nine times in the last 100 years. i'm very sorry. now, if you'll just help me fill out this form for the authorities, i won't intrude on you any longer. now, was he a resident of the country over six months. well, yes, but did he serve in the armed forces. of course, doctor, but what how many years. three years, but three years.  four years. four years. what was that. i said it was four years. don't you remember, lily. the first year i was at fort benning. then i went overseas. and then i was transferred to that outfit   that doctor is ill. he shouldn't be allowed around sick people. lily, what happened. the last thing i remember is something about pumpkin pie. it's all right, herman. you just fainted. that silly doctor thought you were dead. what a ridiculous mistake.  i may be starving to death, but i'm the picture of health. just the same, this diet has gone far enough. no reunion is worth it. no. i've only got lily, only 24 hours. and i'm gonna make it. all i need is a little something to hold me through the day. herman, i think i have just the thing that will hold you. that oughta hold you. thanks a lot. i knew i could depend on you. this reunion must be awfully important to you, herman. are you sure this is the way you want it. lily, it's

was very nice of mrs. farber not to send for the police after the way herman acted. mrs. farber was very understanding. as a matter of fact, she said whenever her husband goes on a diet, he acts hardly human.  becomes a regular fiend. not only did herman eat their entire dinner but he even brought home the cranberry sauce in a doggie bag. gee, dad, you look great. thank you, son. there
