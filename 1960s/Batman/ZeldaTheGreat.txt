batman a quiet peaceful night in gotham city. except at the first national bank at exactly 8:37. hold it. hands up. don't move. escaped, gentlemen. thanks to a bulletproof vest escaped clean as hound's tooth. with precisely one hundred thousand in cash. need i tell you what this means. the devil of an unknown bandit. the one who strikes every april the 1st for exactly a hundred grand. correct, chief o'hara. well, the third year running an identical pattern. got a call from the president of the gotham city league of banks. he told me bluntly the league is becoming uneasy. sure and i don't blame them. a fine bunch of april fools we're looking. oh, don't castigate yourselves. you're tiptop officers, all of you. but still. . two years on this case and you men haven't turned up a single clue. any reason to think you'll do better this time. this one is bigger than the lot of us. commissionerwe need help. yes, i'm inclined to agree. ascend to the roof, chief o'hara, turn on the batsignal. yes, sir. i'll try the hotline. no one to answer the batphone. because bruce wayne and dick grayson along with alfred the butler are on the roof of wayne manor. . stargazing. how's that, master dick. fine, thanks, alfred. wow, the rings of saturn. this is sure some fun, bruce. astronomy is more than mere fun, dick. it is. yes. it helps give us a sense of proportion. reminds us how little we are really. people tend to forget that sometimes. gosh, yes, that's right. i'll bet i'll see those rings a little differently this time. if you boys have finished stargazing there's a delicious rib roast on the dining room table. just one more minute, aunt harriet. goodness gracious, look up at that cloud. isn't that the famous batsignal. 'it sure is, aunt harriet. ' commissioner gordon must wish the services of the, ahem, dynamic duo. mercy alive. whoever that unknown batman is i hope he sees the signal. uh, great heavens, what a fool i am. isn't today wednesday, alfred. indeed, sir. wednesday night, gotham town hall. we have tickets to that lecture on latinamerican affairs. holy venezuela, you're right. if we dash, we can catch part of it. excuse us, aunt harriet. goodnight, aunt harriet. oh, and don't worry about dick's supper, aunt harriet. we'll have some good, hot pancakes later. dick grayson. running out on a rib roast for a lecture in politics. alfred, get ready to catch me. i think i'm gonna faint. my pleasure, madam. sorry about the holdup. what's the problem. youyou just said it yourself, batman. "a holdup. " big. we're on our way. to the batpoles. batman batman batman batman batman batman batman batman batman batman batman well, one clue that slug from the guard's pistol after it ricocheted from the bandit's bulletproof vest. we hoped that it might contain identifiable fibers from the bandit's clothing. no luck, eh. our hopes were blasted. lab report, negative. i'll take this anyway. our own equipment at the batcave may prove more revealing. meantime, let's ponder the crook's motive. a hundred thousand smackers. that's the motive. but why. why exactly one hundred thousand dollars. leaving another half million untouched. batman's right. that has some meaning. the same strange pattern every year. precisely a hundred thousand each april 1st. glory be, i've got it. it's to pay his income taxes. a loyal taxpayer stooping to criminal methods. uh, sure, when you put it that way. i fear you're growing cynical, chief o'hara. the notion of a faithful taxpayer robbing a bank is absurd. it's this case that's driving me mad. 'we're up against a blank wall. ' not even a single lead. right, robin. so what do we do in such a case. we make a lead. 'exactly. ' "make a lead." in heaven's name, boy wonder, how. don't worry. batman will figure it out. won't you, batman. operator, this is batman speaking. get me the editor of the gotham city times. i have a scheme to throw our enemies into confusion. i'm going to plant a story. extra, extra. get your newspaper here. read about the bandit who stole the counterfeit money. yes, that's what he did. counterfeit money. friend, what was counterfeit money doing in the vault of the first national bank. if you wanna know, buy a paper. i ain't no special news service. i wonder what it was doing there. oh, "awaiting at the bank for disposal. " makes sense. hey, paper here. read about the bandit who stole the counterfeit money. here. read about it, right now. how are you doing with that bullet, batman. 'amazing. come here and look. ' any trace of what the crook was wearing. wow. those are fiber patterns, alright. notice from left to right. first, nylon coveralls. next, what seems to beorange wool. and silk. unless i'm crazy, about ten layers of different colored silks. square on the button, robin. this bullet passed through 13 layers of brightlycolored silk. holy rainbow. who'd wear a rig like that. let me show you a clue. gosh, that's a stumper. i think it's organic, though. correct, the unmistakable spectrographic pattern of ambergris. ambergris. you mean that smelly, oily stuff they use in making perfumes. correct again, which leads to only one possible conclusion. the crook was a lady. hardly a lady, robin. but female, yes. the catwoman. no, impossible. she's safely up the river. then who could she be. i don't know. i thinkwe're faced with some new supercriminal not in our crime file. yes, batman. here's a tip, commissioner. alert the entire force. be on the lookout for a woman in an orange dress. good heavens, a woman. what is the world coming to. we can't stop to worry about that now. our task is to fight crime. goodbye for now. the morning newspaper, sir. it just arrived. ah, good. thanks. i want to read this. my pleasure, sir. uh, excuse me, sir. would you and master robin be departing soon. oh, indeed, we will. thank you, sir. then i'll go and get the vacuum cleaner. looks perfect, batman. yep, it's all there. just the way i dictated it. oh, boy. i'll bet somewhere in gotham city there's one really shook lady crook. i hope so, robin. now to make this planted story sprout. meanwhile, behind the facade of this innocentlooking bookstore there lurks the secret workshop of a strange albanian genius. . eivol ekdal. sorry to be late, eivol. counterfeit you bring me. to me, eivol ekdal, worthless counterfeit. look. how could i know, eivol.
