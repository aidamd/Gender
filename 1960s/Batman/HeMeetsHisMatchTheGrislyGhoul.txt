batman we have previously seen. . a day at school. a glass of milk. . not milk, but money. holy cow juice. it's easy living. sounds like the joker. watch out, kids, the joker is back of this. how true. what's he up to. an innocent jukebox. . oh, yeah. plunder by remote control. and in the joker's workshop. . cheerleader susie. a secret member of the gang. but what's the joker's plan. and that night, at school. . watch out. ouch. knockout gas. and inside this van. . . . a ghastly game. three lemons win 50,000 volts. one lemon. . two lemons. short pause. . hold your breath for the dynamic duo. . batman batman batman batman batman batman batman batman batman batman na na na na na na na na na na batman hey, boss, look. what, what, what. the whole town, dark. 'street lights, everything. ' oh. curses and criminy. what confounded luck. gotham city is having a power failure just like new york. the cops. i don't like the twist this joke is taking. get us away. cheese it, everyone. let's go, let's go. strange, an abandoned truck. let's have a look inside. 'holy smoke.' quick, cut us out of here before the power comes on. of that's what we will be, just holy smokes. a mobile slot machine torture van. the mere possession of such a vehicle violates 17 separate statutes. and not a shred of evidence tying it to the devilish joker. no fingerprints, stolen license plates. . you overlooked this, chief o'hara. a reel of tape. right. the tape from our anticrime recorder. before setting out tonight, i equipped my utility belt with a tiny microphone and transmitter. 'every word those criminals said was recorded in the batmobile. ' but what good will that do, boy wonder. i thought you said they spoke to you through a trick voice distorter. tricky, commissioner. tricky, but vain. they didn't realize that every human voice has its own private wave pattern. private as a fingerprint. astounding. is it evidence. can it be used by the district attorney. true, the courts won't accept it as yet. i think i'll take this tape to the batcave. run it through the anticrime voice analyzer. check it against the voice file. that way, we'll learn the identity of the joker's henchmen. we might be able to follow one of them to the joker's hideout. robin's right. it's our only card. let's hope it's a trump. i'm afraid the joker may still hold the winning hand, batman. will the anticrime voice analyzer operate without power. fortunately, commissioner, the batcave is equipped with an anticrime auxiliary generator. which automatically compensates power failure. saints be praised. and the caped crusader's advanced technology. to the batcave. morning. hallelujah. the mighty power grid serving gotham city is back in action. and in the batcave, deep below stately wayne manor. . master scope circuit, aokay. let's check the beginning of the tape. right. that'll be susie when we ran into her in the hall. 'am i ever glad to see you two. ' perfect. what'll i do. jump the tape ahead. roger. pick it up at 12. 7. 'that'll be when we were tied inside' 'that grisly torture van. ' 'oh, let 'em fall. ' the same voice. i don't believe it. susie. quick, both tapes. let's run them again, back to back. 'am i ever glad to see you two. ' 'oh, let 'em fall. ' holy benedict arnold, susie. our chief cheerleader. a member of the joker's criminal gang. is it possible, batman. steady, robin. steady, old chum. but how can it be. it's an old story, i'm afraid. old as eve and the apple. that snake, the joker must have promised her some baubles. led her astray. but what are we gonna do, batman. it's bitter but it's a break. the first one we've had. we'll have to use it. you're right. only how. let's see, today is a school holiday, isn't it. where does that cute little trickster happen to be hanging out. i know. the easy living candy store. it's on east 3rd, two blocks from school. get set, robin. get set for an ugly job. no, correction. what. not robin. . dickdick grayson, undercover agent. 'his job is to get inside that gang. ' dog george to batman, do you read me. 'do you read me, batman.' loud and clear, over. 'i'm about to go in. ' 'how's the microtv camera working.

" one endless night. gee, that's like poetry. no, susie, no. do not open until after you've loaded the milk machine. do you understand. oh, sure, joker, anything you say. you're just the best boss any crook ever had. oh, thank you. hey, joker, it's 3:00. batman's zero hour. watch for the green light. back. everybody, back at the bar. we gotta have room to throw our batarangs when the crooks come in for the loot. ready with the coin, robin. ready. zero hour. put it in the slot. roger. batman's funeral dirge begins. i give him five seconds. now.

'surprise and goodnight.' holy hailstorm. you knew this was gonna happen. or something like it. you see, robin. you betrayed yourself in that candy store. how. despite your boast, it was painfully evident that you're not a smoker. nick must've seen you were working hand in hand with the police. gee, batman, i'm sorry. 'don't be silly. ' it's to your credit that that charade failed. the thing now is to save susie. save susie. 'work it out. ' why would an undercover agent try to pump her. because i knew she was one of the gang. right. and once they know that we know that young lady's life isn't worth a plugged lollypop. holy murder. we gotta find her quick. where. back at the store. school. on saturday. she'll be in the gym practicing cheers. of course. tonight, there's a big game. woodrow roosevelt against disko tech. let's hurry, batman. bartender, a bit of advice. always inspect a jukebox carefully. these machines can be deadly. hello. yeah. right. yeah, just a sec. he's right here. joker. joker it's for you. it's las vegas. pete, the swede. ah. hello, pete, the swede. what's the line on the big game tonight. the odds are 20 to 1. on woodrow roosevelt high. oh, what a killin'. uh, take a whimsical wager. $50,000 on disko tech. yes, pete, the swede, you heard me. disko tech. fifty times twenty. one million bucks. oh, how delicious. what. bet against these champs. the clown prince of crime must have slipped a cog. but wait. .

'caught redhanded with the answers' 'to the nationwide precollege exams. ' the joker. at the moment, merely an honest citizen. we was passing by to inspect this here school property which we support with our taxes. and imagine our surprise. we're not cheats. no, it's a typical filthy joker's trick. it hardly matters, boys. now, does it. when the board of education sees this picture with you holding the answer to those exams. . 'ho, ho, ho, ho. ' good gosh, we'll be suspended. we won't be allowed to play disko tech tonight. oh, well. i'm sure the scrubs will do their best. the scrubs. they'll be creamed. oh, so sad, so sad. and after batman's lectures to you about honesty. what on earth will the caper crusader say. 'ball players. 'run for cover. ' don't worry about having seen those exam papers. they're a fake. 'we planted them' 'and the joker's picture doesn't mean a thing. ' we saved susie's life by using the universal antidote pills in our utility belts. she repaid us by revealing the whole criminal scheme. okay, batman. let's deliver the punch line. tough luck, bad pennies. you're out of circulation. they'll melt you down in a pan. 'holy new year's eve. ' he's got me in his famous trick streamers. have a sneeze on me, batman. no use, joker. i knew you'd employ your sneezing powder. so i took an antiallergy pill. instead of a sneeze, i've caught youcold. that's what easy living gets you kids. stick to your books. and good luck against disko tech. well, i guess it's goodbye, susie. goodbye, dick. i give you my word. i'll mail you the new cheers as soon as they're made up. you can practice 'em while you're away. gosh. what's the matter. you've all been so nice to me. i can hardly bear it. heck, susie, it wasn't all your fault. i mean, with your unhappy childhood in a broken home and everything. no wonder you fell for that crook's phony promises. it's time, susie. the chauffeur is waiting. gee. imagine being taken to jail by a chauffeur. the wayne foundation for delinquent girls is hardly a jail, susie. heck, no. there's teams and clubs and everything. i don't know what to say to you both. i just. . thanks, dick you're welcome, susie. i'll have nightmares all my life, mr. wayne. 'if it hadn't been for that power failure' 'where would robin be.' and where would batman be. where would dick grayson be. huh. 'don't think about it, young people.
