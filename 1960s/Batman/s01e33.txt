' batman, are you there. didid you hear me. yes, i heard you, commissioner. we'll join you at once. who is it, bruce. has the penguin kidnapped someone special. dick, i'm afraid you better put your latin verbs aside for now. the missing man is alfred. holy wayne manor. you don't mean our alfred. yes, dick. i mean our alfred. to the batpoles. batman batman batman batman batman, batman batman batman, batman batman nana nana nana nana nana nana na batman atomic batteries to power. turbines to speed. roger, ready to move out. no doubt at all. it does indeed point to penguin. chief o'hara, i congratulate you on your keen deduction. hmm. ohoh, it was nothing. but what troubles me is what them hoodlums did with alfred. they obviously took him somewhere. hmm. very strange. what is, robin. i'm sure you've noticed, batman. alfred the butler has been kidnapped but there's no ransom demand. my thunderation. the lad is right. but, if it wasn't ransom that the penguin's after, what then. i think i can answer that, chief o'hara. the multimillionaire's annual award dinner. you mean the one at which a dozen multimillionaires each donate a million dollars cash to a chosen charity. what does alfred the butler have to do with that. it's not common knowledge but alfred is the major domo at that affair. . and i happen to know that his employer mr. bruce wayne attends that dinner every year. batman, the location is kept secret to avoid publicity. the only ones who know. . oh. big pardon, boy wonder. if alfred oversees the food and service he knows where it's held. and that means. . 'exactly, robin. ' that's what the penguin is after. he kidnapped alfred to force him to divulge the location of the dinner. good thinking, robin. and $12 million is nothing to sneeze at, even for penguin. come on, robin. let's race to the scene of the kidnapping. we may find a clue. 'but, batman. the fish store is empty. ' it'sit's a false fish store. that's right. we checked it over from stem to stern. meaning no offence, chief o'hara. your department is the finest in the land. butwhere you failed. . robin and i may succeed. ah. the dynamic duo. what would we do without them, o'hara. oh, commissioner. don't even whisper it. oh, i shudder to think of what might. . uhoh. i'm forgetting. parking lot, clear all exits for the batmobile. and meanwhile on gotham city's waterfront. . the riverside rendezvous of the penguin and his fine finny fiends. seagoing scoundrels, all. octopus, more ink. coming, boss. what do you think, penguin poopsy. it's lovely, finella, my little pollywog, lovely. you are not even looking. you told me to practice and you'd make sure that i won a bathing beauty contest. you will, i'll see to that. it's all part and parcel of my piratical plan. but that'll come later. right now, i have other fish to fry. stop it, you ruffian. don't do that. talk. where's this here multimillionaire dinner gonna be held. maybe i oughta run this through you. nay. you mineral brain. but, boss. i gotta make him tell. 'tell what. he can't tell what he doesn't know. ' doesn't know. quite true. i do not know. and not that i'd tell you if i did. but, boss, if he don't have the answer, what good is he. ugh. you don't comprehend my super calculated trickery. but you will. and so will you, alfred, my boy. when i put you in the penguin box. and i'll teach you how to waddle like a penguin. you're quite right. it's no secret now. because the location of the dinner hasn't been decided upon. but when it has, you won't be a silent butler anymore. you'll be a babbling butler. never, it simply isn't done to betray one's master. exactly, exactly. and this penguin box will make me your master. everything ready. 'all set, boss. ' switch. hey, zombie stuff. he's brainwashed. precisely. as i say, my penguin box never fails. he's coming under my power. now watch. you will remember none of this. "i will remember none of this. " what you will remember is. . the time. . "the time. . " 'and the place. . ' "and the place. . " of the multimillionaires dinner. "of the multimillionaires dinner. " is that clear. 'yes. ' yes what. yes. . sir. only a smear of caviar. chief o'hara was right. not a clue in sight. what's that on the floor, robin. that crumpled piece of paper. just an ad for this place. "big sale, cutrate caviar. first come, first served. " 'look closer. the name of the proprietor. ' '"not a fish. "' not a fish. don't you see, robin. if he's not a fishof course. holy subliminal. if he's not a fish, he must be the penguin. exactly. good deduction. the batphone in the batmobile. remember, robin, always look both ways. yes. 'this is commissioner gordon, batman. ' what's wrong, commissioner. not a thing, batman. for once i'm happy to say i'm the bearer of good news. i'm happy to tell you that mr. wayne's butler alfred has not been kidnapped after all. not kidnapped. what does he mean, batman. i heard that, boy wonder. i mean, he has not been kidnapped. alfred the butler has turned up. safe and sound as a dollar. ahem. and you'll never guess where. right back home at the stately mansion of his employer millionaire bruce wayne. thank you, commissioner. that's good news. holy puzzlers, batman. it's great that alfred is safe. butsomehow it sounds fishy to me. it certainly does, robin. and the sooner we talk to alfred ourselves the sooner we'll have the answers. let's go. but of course i smell fishy, sir. one does not purchase without retaining a certain effluvium of fish eggs. i had to hang out my morning coat to air. but, alfred, you were reported kidnapped. we just came from the fish store where they grabbed you. fish store. what fish store. the one you went to, to purchase the caviar. i never went to any fish store, sir. i did as i always do. purchased it direct through the iranian embassy. why. is anything the matter, sir. where did you get that twitch. get what, sir. thattwitch. twitch, sir. what twitch. we'll never learn where the penguin took him this way. patience, there's more than one way to locate a criminal. let's try the memory batbank on alfred. good idea. alfred. mmhmm. would you like to look at some photographs to see if you recognize some people. photos. oh, gladly, sir. yes. 'a criminal type, sir, obviously. and a smooth one. ' they can be the most dangerous. but not familiar. no, sir. a total stranger. 'also a total stranger. and i may add. ' 'i'm glad of it.

'a water front. ' 'holy fog. of course. ' where on the waterfront. it runs for a 146 miles. you're forgetting the other clue, robin. "not a fish" proprietor. let's see if the same name pops up for a fishing pier. 'no. ' '"a fish. " that's it.' 'south pier. let's go.' gosh, batman. it just occurred to me. what if penguin's prepared for us. i hope he's not. but if he is. that's a chance we have to take, robin. we waitin' for somebody, boss. boss, it's the batmobile. yes. batman and robin. i knew that that fish hook would fetch them. you knew. you mean thththey'll grab us. it's the finish. the finish for them, not for us, my quaking cohorts. but they're not captured yet. if i may coin a phrase there's many a slip, so zipper your lip. here they come. inside. out of sight. finella, what're you doing. gee. batman is handsome. what i can make out under the mask. what you can make, my dear, is make yourself scarce. you may as well give yourself up, penguin. will you close your gills. holy clockwork. what next. it proves he's here. come on, robin. where is he. pengybaby, i'm just not sure that this is the right bathing suit. no. look, boss, they're still breathing. so, they are, eh. we'll remedy that by putting them in the. . vacuum tank. not the vacuum tank, boss. it ain't human. hmm, nono, it ain't. well, come on, you mutt headed finks. follow me. greetings, dynamic duo.
