batman a small theater inside washington center. gotham city's new palace of the arts. wednesday afternoon the silent film festival draws to its close. this tittle is incorrect. it is not the end, but the beginning. the cue for one of the most baffling crime waves ever to confront the dynamic duo. good afternoon, mr. van jones. ah, how do you do. on behalf of the committee i want to thank you for loaning us these rare films from your matchless collection. my pleasure, sir. always delighted to do my bit for the lost art of the silent film. what the devil is this. where did you come from. well, i'm afraid, you're not allowed in here. sorry, it's against the. . your idea, mr. van jones. certainly not. i've spent a fortune collecting prints of old movies. but i'm hardly impressed by an amateur group who takes all the attention from them. good day, sir. the riddler. correct, chief o'hara. the prince of puzzlers, that master of criminal conundrum. our hopes for his reform have been blasted once again. let's hope our unknown friend behind the mask is home. yes, commissioner. we'll be right there. what is it, bruce. the riddler. holy triple feature. will that crook ever learn. that's a good question. while we pounder itto the batpoles. excuse me. batman batman batman batman batman batman batman batman batman batman na na na na na na batman "why is a musician's bandstand like an oven." hmm. the manager found that, at the scene of the crime. right, batman. i just can't figure it out. all that thieving devil got for his trouble was 200 bucks. make anything out of that riddle, robin. i think i do. it depends on digging musician's slang. what do you mean, boy wonder. "why is a musician's bandstand like an oven." because that's where he makes his bread. that's it of course. makes bread. precisely, chief o'hara. "bread" in the musician's vernacular means money. astonishing. but where can this clue point. to an oven. a bakery. sure. mother gotham's bakery. the biggest one in the city. i'll bet you a dollar the riddler is after a fat roll. the riddler. after a roll. yes, commissioner. a fat and tasty roll. mother gotham's payroll. come on, robin. let's race there fast. camera loaded, c. b. ready to roll, riddler baby. set it up. remember everybody, stay in the range of c. b's camera. mr. van jones has commissioned me to make him the greatest silent films since the days of immortal charlie. oh, i hope his budget is big enough to take care of us all, aye, riddler. silence, von bloheim. as i tried to tell you our silent film is merely a diversion, a clever ploy essential to our real crime. ah. you mean, heisting the payroll. i do not. i do not. . petty cash this payroll, a red herring for the dynamic duo. wolf, ready with the pies. ready. c. b, ready with the camera. paulineprepare. do your stuff. oh, please, sir. please, you must help me. help you. oh, yes. i must have some bread, to save my poor starving mother. oh, well, i'm sorry. we don't sell bread back here. it doesn't matter. for i have no money with which to buy. therefore i must beg. oh, charity, kind sir. charity. well. i've had to sell everything i own. all except this torn, tattered shall. take it if you must. oh, no, no. . no, i insist. hold it. what's wrong. you can't come in here. why. we have pies to deliver. take those pies down to shipping. that's at the other end. ah, but these are special pies. whipped sleeping cream and nuts. whipped sleeping cream and nuts. nuts to you. ah. von bloheim, the explosive eclair. quickly, quickly. back to the truck for our new camera set up. i'll be with you, soon as i've decorated this place a bit. how'd it go, fellows. oh, wunderbar. even the oscar undoubtedly. inside, inside. pauline into the front with me. aim your camera through the slot, c. b our stars should arrive any moment now. 'ready when you're, riddler baby. ' 'hey, here they come now. ' action. action. no sign of crime here, batman. looks like business as usual. we could have been deceived by that tricky clue. on the other hand. . let's race inside and take a look at that payroll office. 'got it all, riddler baby. ' good. hold tight, everybody. on to the next location. mother gotham never baked this pie. it's topped with sleeping cream. we're too late. look at that blow safe. look at that wall. "batman. as one baker to another. "how do you make a dishonest shortcake." "dishonest shortcake." there's strawberry shortcake. and blueberry shortcake. a dishonest shortcake. i've got it. a lieberry. that would make it a dishonest shortcake. right, robin. lieberry. clearly a corrupted version of the word library. "as one baker to another. " hey, isn't there a branch library on baker street. of course and aunt harriet goes there all the time. we haven't a moment to lose. let's race to the batmobile. gotham city library, bakers street branch. right again, dynamic duo. be careful. roll on, c. b. roll on. look at that crump. 'right in a well marked, no parking zone. ' he's within his rights, robin. observe. diplomatic plates. the heart of diplomats in our city is a small prize to pay for world leadership. now, let's check out that library. "baker street branch closed on wednesdays "because of lack of funds. " shocking, shocking. looks like this lock has been tampered with, batman. you're right. we'll use the batkey. cut. cut. quickly now, before the duo awake. back to our screening room to see how this crime develops. oh. holy headache. what hit us. a clever booby trick. a bash on the head by this weighty tome. "a pictorial history of silent films. " here it is. it's the same theme that's run through this entire caper from the outset. look, batman. two more riddles on the flyleaf. tough ones too. let's race back to the batcave. this needs more research. meanwhile in the abandoned cutting room of a bankrupt movie studio the new secret headquarters of the riddler and his felonious filmsters. so, this rough cut is ready. roll 'em, von bloheim. roll 'em. . first sequence in mother gotham's bakery. wow. what a gasser. our stars. our unwitting stars, von bloheim. where are they. oh, just a moment. they make their appearance in the picturenow. 'action. ' now comes the topper. oh. watch. watch these costume clowns dance to my tune. oh. but we have an even more dazzling one to film. my tricky brew. all ready for the fatal party. are you sure batman and robin will be there, riddler baby. of course they'll be there. on the flyleaf of that book, i left them the clearest clues conceivable. "riddle number one. "what do you find in a kitchen cabinet "that is not alive." i should hope, sir, that in the cabinet of a properly run kitchen one would find nothing whatever alive. alfred's right, batman. in a clean kitchen cabinet, everything should be dead. dead knifes, dead forks, dead spoonsdead pots, dead pans. . deadpans. beg pardon, sir. don't you see, alfred. it fits right in with the criminal theme. deadpans, like those comics used to use in the old silent films. deadpan expressions. riddler's telling us his next will be a deadpan caper. ah, yes. most ingenious. now, let's apply our brain power to riddle number two. "when is a new car considered to be seedy." holy kindergarten. that's almost too easy. a new car is seedy when it's a lemon. right. you don't fancy, sir. that this famous desperado intends to stoop to the robbery of a lemonade stand. you've hit it. it fits like my glove. what, batman. mr. van jones is a famous collector of deadpan silent films. he's also a noted temperance leader. and he's invited bruce wayne to a party this afternoon in which nothing will be served but lemonade. wow. will mr. wayne attend, sir. send his regrets, alfred, he will not. but batman will. come on, robin, we may still have time to spike riddler's punch. watch what this liquid does when it is introduced into the drinks, you will see a temperance party shot intoa temper party. alas, too late, for even as the dynamic duo speeds towards the residence of millionaire van jones someone else is in van jones' pantry first. spiking the punch. that should bring out the temper in these temperance fellows. got the camera handy, c. b. where i can grab it in a jiffy. happy shooting. enjoythe comedy to come. maury wills is better than honus wagner. fifty times better. you're an ignorant oaf, chief o'hara. i wonder why i keep you in my department. your royal highness, often i wondered why i don't resign. oops. you clumsy brut, did you bump into me on purpose. i'm sorry. terribly. i didn't think batman was on your guest list, mr. van jones. considering these louds who were, dearie. 'i'd say that's entirely in his favor. ' pretty sour lemonade, van jones. you don't like it, lump it. personally i think, it's unusually sweet. the boors a man in my position has to tolerate. is it worth it. nah. batman to batmobile. all quite here, batman. any sign of the riddler. not a trace, robin. but there's something strange going on here. everyone seems to be in the most incredibly bad temper. 'it's pink. ' in fact. . say that once again, stupid. your dress is pink, color blind. i'll call you back. give him a solid. . oh, sir. sir, please help me. please. what's the matter. a horrible man dressed in green tights just leapt out of the bushes and seized my little brother. what. dress in green. yes. and he shouted the strangest thing. he said, "a clue. " he shouted at me and "when is a bonnet not a bonnet." the riddler. and that clue's a snap. a bonnet is not a bonnet, when it becomes a young woman. oh, how clever you are. citizens. stop it. stop it. stop this. have you all lost your senses. the batman spots us. batman to, robin. batman calling, robin. 'do you read me, robin.' 'robin. ' riddle me this, my criminal crew. when does a boy wonder, rhyme with bubble. when he's in trouble. wrong. when he's double. split in two halves. . right down the middle. camera ready to roll, c. b. rollin, riddler baby. how would you like your sideburns, boy wonder. long or short. batman will get you for this, riddler. oh. 'but will he get you.' i believe you said, he'd be here in no time. question. is no time, in time. uh. after many gassers here's the real buzzer. is robin going to wind up as his own double. incredible but true. batman will not arrive in time. will we see the boy wonder sawed in two. tune in tomorrow. same battime. same batchannel. batman batman batman batman batman batman batman batman batman batman na na na na na na batman )
