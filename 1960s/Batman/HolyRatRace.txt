batman so far we have seen a jeweled crown. an inflating cape. a crown proved false. a cry for aid. and a ready answer. while false face plotted. . a robbery. . no an ambush. which backfired. false face in chief's clothing captured the chief. deduction by the duo. a daring escape by blaze. later nabbed by the caped crusader. interrogation and repentance. . and embrace. holy entanglement. a gasser. an escaping pair. the dynamic duo on the wrong track. facing a fearsome fate. wait. the wildest is yet to come. batman batman batman batman batman batman batman batman batman batman na na na na na na batman in the batcave, deep under wayne manor a faithful alfred tends to his daily duties. 'and now the cultural hour brings you a special message. ' 'uh, to the friends of batman' 'many are called, but two are chosen, be receptive. ' 'now, we return to the fragile intricacies of mozart. ' hold on, old chum, i've got an idea. batman. calling batman and robin. 'this is the batcave, calling batman. ' 'calling batman. ' it's alfred, i've turned on the batradio. alfred, batman here. oh, very good, sir. i was concerned. alfred, pull the short circuit lever on the battransmitter. short circuit lever. but, sir, that will destroy your wrist batradio. alfred, our relationship has always been one of mutual respect. i cannot disregard my own standards and order you to destroy the battransmitter. but i am urging you to comply. if you put it that way, sir. wasn't that batman and robin. ah, yes. fighting crime where ever it maybe. good for them. escaped the tricky twosome tore free, thanks to you. why accuse me, ff. batman's a redoubtably fine crime fighter. fine, huh. perhaps, you find him attractive, intriguing. . was that it. i, false face, i was merely according batman the respect due an outstanding adversary. i haven't the slightestnot so much protesting, blaze, and i'd believe you sooner. i say, do the deepsix with her. not so fast. i make the moves in this mob. yes, sir. i'll decide about you in the morning, blaze. meanwhile, i warn you. one thing i will not allow is anyone being false to me. say, the radio message said "many are called but two are chosen." yes, sir. clearly a reference to yourself and master robin. i therefore activated the batalarm and called you on the battransmitter. luckily for us. but gosh. why'd false face trap us then send a warning. why. he wouldn't. but who would. the question is, robin, not only why, but who. very neatly done, alfred. thank you. who sent that message. who. o'hara, where have you been. on a garbage scow, commissioner. it's alright. in a sack, i was wrapped up and abandoned. that's criminal. that it is, sir. and that's why i'm concerned about batman and robin. the caped crusaders. yes. or i was put into this condition byfalse face. today, all gotham city is pulsating with one question. "what criminal outrage will false face perpetrate next." meanwhile, police chief o'hara shaken by his ordeal as the prisoner of the masked master of criminal concealment has sworn revenge. chief o'hara will broadcast an appeal to the citizenry of gotham city later tonight. of course. what is it, batman. broadcast. we'll trace that mysterious radio message back to it's broadcasting source. holy transistors. let's go. 'who ordered that announcement.' 'a complete stranger. anonymous. ' 'frankly, batman, i assumed that it was' 'simply another announcement. ' if someone wishes a message broadcast like "many are called, two are chosen" i assume it's religious and that's all. i don't think we should treat religion lightly, mr. gore. oh, of course not. i merely meant i treated it as part of the day's work. then it's another dead end. thanks to false face. is that who's involved. false face. the criminal master of disguise. none other. that's why we hoped you'd give us a clue. i'm sorry that. . i say, there was one little thing that you might call peculiar. what is it. the young lady who paid for the announcement she was not only staggeringly beautiful she had green hair. green hair. holy wigs. blaze. 'does that mean anything to you.' indeed it does. good observation, gore. darn good observation. then perhaps you can tell me what she meant by a parting remark. as she handed me the check in payment she said "i could bank on its being false. " check bank false. what bank was that check drawn on. 'gotham national. ' of course. that's the bank the false face is planning to break. you mean the check is no good. not as a check, mr. gore. but as a message. yes. send the check to commissioner gordon. i'll see that you're paid. blaze ordered the radio announcement. and saved our lives. she did even more than that. at great risk, she gave us the clues to false face's next move. how so, batman. when she handed the man a check in payment for the announcement she said, he could bank on it being false. sounds rather cryptic to me. the check was drawn in the gotham city national bank. it baffles me, batman if false face contemplates a counterfeiting coup why he'd break into a bank. for a double dose of diabolical deception. think, what's in a bank. money. right. and what is false face been forging. money, counterfeit money. right again. and think of the consequences if false face would place the bank's good money with counterfeit currency. ghastly. it's gambling for billions. gosh, nobody's money would be worth anything. except false face's. and nobody would be able to tell true from false. he must be stopped. no, he must be encouraged, enticed and only then. . entrapped. but how. by falsehood. falsehood. is batman capable of outfalsing false face. perfect. no one suspected you were hiding in here all day. now the bank is closed and we're ready to begin our attack, right. 'right, ff. ' brinks, the bars. very good, brinks. benz, careful now, there's a very cunning electric eye set just 18 inches above the floor. go. right, ff. electric eye alarm, eliminated. excellent, excellent, excellent. pinkerton, the tnt time talking. . yes, ff. back, back. we did it, ff. we're rich. beyond the dreams of avarice. not my dreams of avarice. quickly now, loot sacks out. now, let me at that lock. is it clean. i'll dust it, ff. he's so fastidious. what. is it possible. not only possible but true. please, not that word. we've turned your own tricky tables on you, false face. via a false vault. i'm never outtricked until the last turn, boy wonder. chief o'hara, tell your men to search all these cubicles. careful. ow. i'll handle him, chief. good man. he's been gassed. by that counterfeit policeman false face. after him, robin. the dogged duo is in hot pursuit. and they'll catch you, false face. 'i hope so. i sincerely hope so. ' because, you little fool i'm leading them into a truly torturous trap. what is false face's fiendish foolery. are the caped crusaders heading into a culdesac. will this be the dead end for the dedicated deeds of batman and robin. the old bioscope studios has been abandoned for years. false face must have his hideout here in the crumbling sets and faded false front. we'll expose his concealments to the light of day and put him behind real bars. good. they're hot on my trail. and very soon, they maybe even hotter. as a matter of fact, perhaps too hot. oh, you monster. holy rats in a trap. false face is getting away. no, robin, he seems to be coming back this way. what's he up to. let's find out. commissioner, dispatch a patrol car immediately to the bioscope studios to pick up a couple of thugs that robin and i netted. and we expect to add false face himself to the collection shortly. false face may still have a plot or two in his bag of fiendish tricks. it's time for a little trickery of our own, robin. they're coming right at me. aah. i've done it. i've done it. i destroyed the dynamic duo. you diabolical demon. ahha. well, your clever caped crusaders are now kaput. brilliantly done, batman. but i blew up the batmobile. i saw it go. not exactly, false face. you destroyed a false batmobile. and inflated duplicate that i prepared for just this kind of situation. face it, false face. you've been outdecoyed. you fell for a phony target. now, will you come quietly. not yet, dynamic duo. wait, it's faster on foot. get me outta here. stay here, robin. howdy, partner. what's all the ruckus. 'there's a criminal loose. ' rustlers, huh. well, i'll join the posse myself. i'll head 'em off at the pass. intercepted, false face. commissioner. are you alright. yeah, chief. but the trickster got away from me. vanished that way. let's get after him. yes, i'll send reinforcement. chief, i must get back to my office. order me a squad car. that's not necessary. false face must be found before he springs another sinister scheme. absolutely accurate false face. but, caped crusader, that's the commissioner. is it. then why is a righthanded commissioner holding his handkerchief in his left hand. saints alive. it's false face. so you finally fumbled, false face. for the moment. i lost him. luckily, commissioner, he found us. impersonating a police commissioner. well, the warden will be workin' out a warm welcome for you. game and set to you, cape crusader. but wait, you may yet meet your match. come, come, now. let's not be late. you know how sensitive a criminal can be the first day of parole. but which criminal. and why here. because the bruce wayne rehabilitation fund arranged for it all. and i must say i think this one magnificent success justifies the entire risk. just think, a hardened criminal completely reformed. 'you may come in now. ' penguin. joker. blaze. good morning, mr. wayne. mr. grayson. i wanna thank you personally, mr. wayne. because of your rehabilitation fund i feel like a new girl. the pleasure is truly mine. what are your plans now, miss. i plan to go to new zealand to keep house for my poor, but honest brother. he's a sheep herder. an entire new life. i think that's simply fine. and you are one of the two men who've made this possible. two men. who was the other one. batman. 'the scourge of crime.' cape crusader himself. i hope when i've paid my debt to society that i can in some way, somehow repay batman. i would think that somehow he knows of your redemption. and somewhere he's glad. batman batman batman batman batman batman batman batman batman batman batman )
