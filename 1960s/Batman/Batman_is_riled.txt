joke laughing at us for letting him get away it might be more than a joke chief ohara batmans right it could be a clue a clue sure the crime wave hes plotting but why would he leave you a clue batman he might not mean to its a trait of the criminal mind the urge to boast it often leads to the criminals giving himself away a bust mounted on a pedestal a bust a pedestal where does one usually find a bust mounted on a pedestal  in a museum right or in a hall of fame or in both  exactly a perfect set up for one of the jokers jolly crimes i dont understand batman this very day the gotham museum of modern art opened a new exhibit a comedians hall of fame i read in the paper they were not going to include the joker just the thing to make him want to get even of course the museum also houses a

ten oclock move promptly to the exits please you were saying batman or else  i dont know museum officials couldve heard about the jokers prisonbreak and hastily included him sure so as not to enrage

matter batman no its nothing for a second there i couldve sworn i saw that statue move sure looks lifelike its almost as if i could hear that hateful harley quinn laughing come on lets find the
