' ah, correct. criminals, we don't wish to undermine what little remaining faith you might have in organized society. yes. this line better not be traced, my friends. . or it'll be very sad for mrs. harriet cooper. how is she. oh, well, quite well, boy wonder. at least as well as one can be in a straitjacket over a fatal pool of flaming oil. you devil. how could a woman stoop to such a trick. talk of tricks. what about that phony star of samarkand this morning. it was a fair weapon in a fight against crime. you know that as well as i do. enough of this prattle. mr. wayne, listen to my instructions about the ransom. wait. what. are you trying to give me orders. wait, the boy wonder is about to make a dramatic confession. that story in the paper about the bank money being counterfeit 'it was false. ' what. it was a ruse. it was a batman's trick to make you try again. that money you stole last night is real. a statement from the editor of the gotham city times "this morning's headline. . was entirely untrue. " look. 'it's signed and notarized. ' 'let me add my assurance. ' as the director of the first national bank of gotham city. let me tell you that the money in your possession is 100% bonafide. you gotta believe mr. wayne. as bank director, if he made a false statement he would be liable to federal prosecution. yes. don't you see out there. this reckless crime of yours isn't necessary. you already have your filthy lucre. for your own sake, release mrs. cooper immediately. oh, come on, you crook. you can't be all bad. let the poor lady go, huh. yes. thank you. i believe you. it was only desperation that drove me to this. youyou'll release your victim. at once, with pleasure. where. don't worry. you'll find her. goodbye. goodbye. ah, thank you, ladies and gentlemen. thank you very much. and now, we return you to our regular scheduled program in progress. holy hallelujah. we did it. thanks to you, robin. it was your warm appeal that turned the tide. i'll call chief o'hara. i'll put the entire force on the alert. get me chief o'hara. chief o'hara, yes, thank you. are you alright. could i help you, madam. i'm mrs. harriet cooper. the kidnap victim. yes. would someone please call a policeman. my relatives must be terribly worried. yes, ma'am. scarcely minutes later back at stately wayne manor. . is she alright, doctor. an amazing woman, mr. wayne. it was a real fight to make her accept sedation. 'well, that's aunt harriet all over. ' you're sure she had no clues to divulge about the crooks. not one alas. it seems that the minute she was lured into the taxi she was subjected to a potent but harmless drug. now, if you'll excuse me, i must go. yes, of course. thank you, doctor. i suppose you'll be wanting to find batman now. that's right, mr. wayne. i will. what's the matter, alfred. excuse me, sir, but i can't help feeling that this whole somber episode is my fault. your fault. indeed, sir. had i not been down dusting the batcave when that false phone call arrived. . good heavens. perish the thought, alfred. you were performing your proper duty. begging you pardon, sir. not true. ordinarily, i tend to the batcave on wednesday evenings. i fail to do so because of my addiction to a certain television program. listen, alfred, rid yourself of guilt. that's right, alfred. aunt harriet's fine now. she's more than fine. if it hadn't been for her mishap i wouldn't have deduced the criminal's identity. what. you know. dear me. and i thought, uh, i thought i discovered the decisive clue. this, uh, book of matches, sir. the gnome book store. where did you find this, alfred. 'just now, sir. ' on the staircase. they must've fallen out of mrs. cooper's pocket when we helped her upstairs. i had hoped that they might indicate the whereabouts of the felon's lair. nice thinking, alfred. darn nice thinking. to the batpoles. atomic batteries to power. turbines to speed. gosh, batman, i'm stumped. who the heck is the crook. think over the clues. a female magician. so what use is that. like we found in the files there are 27 female magicians licensed to practice in gotham city. think harder. remember what she told us about aunt harriet's plight. suspended in a straitjacket over a. . holy birthday cake. right. my last birthday, you took me to see her. we even met her backstage. zelda the great. sure, i remember. that straitjacket escape was her big gimmick. as usual, vain boasting has been this criminal's undoing. gosh, though. where does this gnome book store come in. where indeed. for back behind the phony book store eivol is ready with his inescapable doomtrap. well, well. legal tender after all. isn't life surprising, hmm. you have your money, eivol. now, tell me the secret. how do i escape from the doomtrap. you mean you haven't guessed, zelda. even after the hint i gave you. there is no way to escape. true. even i, eivol ekdal, with all my twisted albanian genius. even i cannot devise the answer. that is where batman comes in. oh, we lure him into the trap. then he show us the way out. exactly. we use him as our pawn. well, you mad albanian. even if batman does work out the trick how can i use it on stage when batman knows. we have an obscure peasant saying in my country "dead men tell no tales. " dead men. but of course, dear zelda. after batman escapes from the doomtrap he walks into instant liquidation. wait, i show you. ah. . gentlemen, welcome, gentlemen. all set up for the rub out. yes, yes. show me the money. one hundred grand. don't bother to count. it might make us mad. it's like fringe benefit. another $100,000 i get for. . what is the word. fingering batman. i sign a contract with the syndicate. kidnapping, murder. where will it end. you know i abhor violence. you wretched weakling. you should've thought of that before you rob your first bank. now, stop the stupid questions and think of a way to lure batman into our trap. done. what done. as i told you, eivol, i'd guessed your scheme. i cleverly left a clue. i stuck a book of your matches in mrs. copper's pocket. no doubt he's on his way already. not a moment to lose. gentlemen, into the sarcophagi. quickly. you see. they have peep holes. what's the shooting schedule. the instant batman escapes from the doomtrap, shoot. why not shoot him before he gets in. because we need batman to show us how to escape from the doomtrap, you fools. gentlemen, dear friends. remember, contract calls for bumping batman after he escapes. it's in writing. okay, if it's in writin'. okay. please gentlemen. there it is. closed. back in one hour. could be a deception. right you are. it's not even locked. electric eye. someone's coming into the shop. quickly, zelda, quickly. where. into my secret control booth. in the wings. quickly. you may look in this periscope. look, batman, a note on the counter. "to whom it may concern. "try interesting volume on top shelf last book of back row. " gosh. could it concern us. it certainly could. look at that title. the truth aboutbats. wow. that book worked a concealed switch. let's see how the plot goes, huh. bizarre. a play without actors. this script could be for us. one way to find out. let's get in the limelight. look, in this booth. it's a bat. i bet it means something. holy fish bowl. we're shut in. got them. a trick magnetic padlock. oh, it seems such a waste. they're such handsome creatures. shut up. eivol, eivol, can i help being a woman. shut up i said. now, i turn on the secret speakers hidden in the doomtrap. 'gosh, batman. what kinda trap is this.' it is a doomtrap, boy wonder. 'welcome to my greatest achievement. ' 'the inescapable doomtrap. ' poor, twisted mind. 'you stupid fools. i am a genius. ' yeah, that's what they all say. pipe down, robin. we have to humor him. what's the big idea, genius. very simple, batman. try to escape. let's just do that. our utility belts. 'useless.' my jet age plastics are impervious to your tools. eivol, what if even batman cannot escape the trap. that will be very sad. then i would have to give back your money. or i could go back to the drawing board. gosh, i'm afraid it's true. this stuff is tough. you are wasting time and you have so little left. now. . look down at your feet. a deadly, colored gas is issuing. quick, let's get that grill. 'ow.' 'electrified. ' holy graveyard, batman. 'this could becurtains. ' 'don't quit, robin. let's get our heads down. ' 'this gas is rising. ' 'lighter than air.
