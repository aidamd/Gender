'297, oh great pharaoh.' speed it up. alfred, if we ever had need of our brain power it's now. here are the last four fixes we've got. the problem is to extrapolate them. project them to the criminal's putative destination. correct, and if we extend their azimuth like this correcting from one wayhow peculiar. it leads us to this vacant area that coordinates 47 to 61. wait a minute. coordinates 47 to 61. holy foxtrot. the egyptian palace from last year's gotham city exposition. robin speaking. 'we've just had a message. ' king tut is holding batman is his secret hideout. he will exchange him for $1 million in cash. to be delivered personally by bruce wayne. you think it's on the level, commissioner. i do. but unfortunately i can't get a hold of bruce wayne. there's no answer at his stately mansion. don't worry. i'm on my way to find him right this second. goodbye, commissioner. are you sure that was prudent, master robin. what, alfred. well, they're pretty certain of the whereabouts of king tut's hideout. should we not have informed the police and requested their aid. i didn't dare chance it. they're great guys, alfred but they can be heavyhanded too and when those fiends have batman. . i follow your thinking. the rude intrusion of the police might have provoked the criminals to some unhappy act of violence. right, alfred. this one we've gotta pull ourselves. to the batmobile. to the. . batmobile. but you don't have a license to drive, master robin. but you do. twinkle twinkle little bat how i wonder what you're at chief torturer, what's the latest pebble count.

'voice control batmobile relay circuit switch on. ' batmobile ejection seat. fire. what the heck. the failure signal. circuits on the blink, i'm afraid. how can it be. human mechanisms are made by human hands, robin. none of them is infallible. it's a lesson which must be faced. hey, look. 'he's coming back at us. ' what the heck. look out, he's found the batbeam. farewell. we rid thebes forever of its rodents. holy sky rocket. he hit the batbeam button and the ejector seat went off. well hit, sir. gosh. and to think he was once a famous professor in yale university. that's life, robin. full of ups and downs. it'll be if it's any of us to grow too confident. a tragic case, batman. one of the saddest which has ever crossed my ken. there maybe hope for him yet. but how. with proper treatment. mental institutions are hopelessly overcrowded. the taxpayers are blind to our pleas. what about the wayne foundation. gosh, yes. it's a great idea, batman. but do you think mr. wayne'll go for it after being kidnapped by this devil. chief o'hara, i understand that mr. bruce wayne is a man of great understanding and compassion. i'll phone bruce wayne instantly and ask him to come over here. watch out. argh. he's wakin' up. ii must. . young gentlemen rioting is not going. . be careful. ooh. ohh. what an amazing dream. i must be late for class. late for class. yes. egyptology. . ohmy. . what is this. a miracle, professor. simply a miracle. oh. . oh, whatever will the dean say. next week the dynamic duo versus the bookworm. batman batman batman batman batman batman batman batman batman batman na na na na na batman )
