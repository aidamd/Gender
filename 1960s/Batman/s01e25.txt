' 'oh, by the way, did you hear what the maid said' 'when the duchess asked if she'd given the goldfish' 'fresh water that morning.' 'no, your highness. he hasn't yet used what he had yesterday. ' not a very funny joke i'd say. the joker's never arein the end. do you suppose any of this could mean anything. possibly. but not what it seems to mean. that's the key to the joker's twisted mind. but why. itit's not like the joker to help us catch him. it could be a trap. why would he want a hole from a golf course. the golf course. of course. "his highness, the maharajah of nimpah "arrived in gotham city today and he's so rich he plays golf with jewel inlaid solid gold clubs. " that's it, batman. the joke on the tape. his highness and the golden goldfish. and he's scheduled to play in one hour at the winnie coto country club. where he stole the hole. let's go. be careful, batman. be careful. while at the exclusive winnie coto country club a sinister figure looms above the fairway. it's batman. crime is certainly rampant these days. batman. batman i presume. correct. i'm prescott belmont, president of the club here. got your message. i'll be glad to assist you in any way. good. there could be more foul play here today. has the maharajah of nimpah begun his round. not five minutes ago with his honor the mayor. they're still on the first hole. is there some vantage point overlooking the course. any place where we won't be conspicuous. the lower terrace. let's go.

"batman, did you hear about the kid "who wanted to sell his dog for $50,000. "he got his price. traded it for two $25,000 cats. "but you can't make a deal like that for the maharajah "because we've got plenty of cats already. don't call us, we'll call you. " "plenty of cats." cats, cats and more cats. it could be an old refinery katz, katz, katz & company. it's been outta use for years, but it'd make a perfect hideout. it sounds too simple. almost as if he wanted us to solve it immediately. gotta be on our guard, batman. right. let's go. how right they are, for inside the seemingly innocent old refinery the joker and his crew prepare for company. oh, my playful, pilfering pals this is going to be delicious. bring the table in here quickly. quickly. put it right in the center. now get the chairs. get the chairs. one, one here, one over here, one there, one there, one there. quickly. everything must be just right. now, how does that look, my pretty. oh, perfect, joker. ha ha ha. do you really think he'll come. ah, he'll be here, never fear. you mark my words. joker, why didn't you get me something longer than this when you had the chance. oh, that's not my style, lovey. any common hoodlum can do that. oh ho, but never fear, my dear. we'll buy you countless fursand jewels. oh, gee, joker, you're perfect. yeah, practically. 'joker. joker.' he just parked his car up the street. excellent. everybody, take your places. and you stand out of harm's way, my dear. there. deal them out. what will we do, batman. use the batropes. go in through the skylight. let's try the direct approach. with his twisted mind, it could surprise him. strange. it's not locked. holy spiderwebs. a nest for rats. now. we got you this time, joker. want to join the game, batman and boy wonder. you'd better hurry. it won't last long. holy looking glass. a truck with folding mirrors on its sides. no wonder it vanished. yes, with nothing but the green of the golf course to reflect, it turned green too and seemed to disappear. but we're on to your tricks, joker. you might as well. . assemble now and intertwine neatly wrap these guests of mine no more will they jeer and scoff i cut their circulation off if they do not see the joke pull in the ropes and let them choke holy. . it's like being caught in a barrel of snakes. well, well, now i must say, this is an expected pleasure. you may have won the first round, joker but we don't give up. hmm, i've heard about batman but this is the first time i've ever met him. and the last. so that's your dirty game. we might have known. why didn't we think about this. think about it. yeah. what's this. have you gone soft, my little savage. well, i, uh, ii bet he wouldn't try to knock you off if he had the chance. oh, no, he'd merely try to incarcerate me in durance vile for the rest of my life. a fate much worse than death for a spirit such as mine. stillwe might give them a sporting chance. yeah. oh, no, boss. we won't get another chance like this. that's right. we've gotta get rid of him. we owe it to the criminal world. well, we'll see. bring them along. come, come, come. and now, my dynamic duo something i've been waiting to do for a long time. there, my funny ray has neutralized the gadgets in your utility belts for at least an hour. you're both good swimmers i hope. fair. then you can easily remain afloat for an hour i presume. if we weren't weighted down or something. boss, you let these guys escape it'll be the mistake of your career. 'yeah. ' 'you keep outta this. ' if he wants to give them a chance that's his business. oh, well, perhaps they won't make it. gentlemen, step that way, please. this is delicious. absolutely delicious. enough, enough, enough. out of my way. i'll give you a few minutes to get out of these before i start filling that. and if you remain afloat for an hour, you go absolutely free. now what more could you ask. i still suspect some trick. now, now, let's not be bitter. i think we should give him the benefit of the doubt, robin. . until he proves otherwise. 'it's only fair. ' 'i suppose you're right. ' of course, he's right. uh, gentlemen, be my guests. . would you. come, my darling. holy smokestack. 'what a spot to get out of.' 'right, batman. ' 'there are only two ways to get outta there. ' 'one, i let you out' 'and two, you jump you still intend to free us if we can stay afloat for an hour. oh, dear me. surely you don't think i'd joke about such a serious matter as that, do you. no. oh, time to start filling the tank. 'but that's gas. ' 'i do believe you're right. ' 'but then who said anything about water.' but you can't float in gas. no. but you can drown in it. oh, joker, that's a dirty trick. oh, forget it, jill. you didn't really think i was gonna pass up a chance like this did you, my peerless pair. 'play traitor to all my principles and friends.' 'oh ho ho, no. ' ah, but one last word of advice don't stir it up. too narrow in here to use the batrope. there's nothing for them to catch on. and he's neutralized the rest of the stuff in the utility belt. what are we going to do. unless there's someone to help us. . i don't know. but help from where. not the joker, certainly. and no one else knows where they are. is this the joker's crowning jest. find out tomorrow night same time, same channel. but be prepared, no help is likely to come. batman batman batman batman batman batman batman batman batman batman nana nana nana nana na batman )
