of foul play a criminal maestro of a thousand ubiquitous umbrellas but i thought he was still up the river commissioner so did i until i checked with the penitentiary the penguin was released three days ago any volunteers men anyone think hes smart enough to net the penguin oh commissioner i speak for us all theres but one man living who can throw the net over that cagey bird thank you chief ohara i admire your honesty and i make it unanimous whoever he may be behind that mask of his our only hope is the caped crusader and in wayne manor stately home of millionaire bruce wayne and his youthful ward dick grayson alfred the faithful butler responds to the hotline ill summon him sir oh heck whats the use of learning french anyway dick im surprised at you language is the key to world

a feint at the jewelry store to set us up for the real knockout later on zowie robin could be right then again  i wonder if this whole affair might just have been a harmless practical joke a joke batman i have great faith in our prison system commissioner perhaps the penguins spell up the river has made him reform youre dreaming batman itll be a sad day for corkscrews when that crooked bird goes straight still id like to know what his state of mind was when he left prison bonnie send in warden crichton will you warden crichton of state prison here i anticipated your question batman i had him rushed down by helicopter good morning good morning warden crichton good to see you warden the dynamic duo pleased im sure the honor is ours warden ive long been a deep admirer of your fine work in reforming criminals well weve had our little victories our little failures too alas how would you rate the penguin ill let you judge that for yourself batman indeed judge for myself by means of video tape its one of my new progressive policies you see before releasing a felon i assign him to a special cell into which is built a secret television camera it enables us to study the extent to which hes reformed if any warden you didnt forget the tape i took the liberty of leaving it at your communications center when i arrived theyre waiting for your signal commissioner gordon roll warden crichtons video tape on the closed circuit holy haberdashery that cant be regulation prison uniform can it its another of my progressive policies boy wonder during the last week before release i permit the prisoners to wear their own clothing it helps acclimate them to the outside world sound penology warden very sound listen the baleful bird is about to chirp how irritating here i am due to be released tomorrow and i still havent worked out one single crime worthy of my talents my whole stay in this disgusting prison is wasted yeah well thats the way it bounces penguin some years are just a blind spot out of a guys life hey wait a minute my motherinlaw she owns a candy store you could always knock that over if you wanna what a candy store im an aristocrat of crookery my dear man no i must devise something royal unsuspected sensational a keeper thatll make that batman blow his brains out yeah that batman hes sure some kind of pest aint he say do you ever stop to think penguin

that phony spider web ooh yes secret tv eyes  well goodnight big brother yes im afraid youll have to unravel the rest of my plot by yourself any thoughts batman on the whole i think wed better discard my theory about the penguins going straight where did i go wrong why did my progressive policies fail with an attitude like his im amazed he was turned loose at all uh warden ours is a rule of law boy wonder when a man has paid his debt to society he must be released gosh yes that was a pretty dumb remark of mine dont fret about it old man the important thing is to get on the penguins trail fast ill put out a four points bulletin wait ive got a better idea yes the penguin told us on that secret tape whatever his dazzling plot is it involves umbrellas so hell need a front right quickly commissioner send for the city records lets find out if anyones opened an umbrella factory in the last three days three new umbrella factories none of them unfortunately in the name of penguin its a dead end could he be using an alias good thinking robin chief read me the names of those umbrella factory licenses heres rl howard kg bird ep sherlock bird kg bird cagey bird the penguin get it get it
