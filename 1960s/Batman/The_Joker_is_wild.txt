batman in the last bat episode we saw a grand opening with a big comeon then pandemonium the telltale umbrella the mark of that old devil penguin the bat call was made batman leapt into the fray  against the penguin  and his fine feathered finks what was their plot a bank job no another red herring and then  a monster umbrella  with a clue attached baffling to the dynamic duo they decided to bug the tricky bird the bug was planted and the penguin was bugged batman was trapped and ready for the barbeque it was getting very warm but waitthe worst is yet to come batman batman batman batman batman batman batman batman batman batman na na na na na na na na batman somethings fishy alfred no signal from the superpower radio transmitter built into that spider not even a carrier wave it might be due to sunspots master robin i believe they can inhibit even the most powerful radio waves does seem rum however i do hope mr bruce hasnt fallen into some  hot spot drat that heat is waking him up he wont throw no good we hooked that net real tight yeah its like steel its like a real golden eagle net who is that guy anyway thats what id like to know ive seen him someplace before has he flipped that guy needs a cigarette lighter like a moose needs a hat rack you fool thats the kind i use myself its filled with a lifetime supply of butane gas compressed inside if he managed to toss that into the furnace  dont worry boss well get him wait a minute let him go what hell go running to the cops penguin how can he you birdbrains hes a crook himself remember  he was trying to bug my shop say yeah thats right the main thing is he wont come nosing around here anymore besides i need both of you here my fine feathered finks the time is almost nigh at the signal the time will be precisely forty minutes to go at precisely  oclock the builtin timer will send the batbrella into action exactly two minutes to ill give bruce two minutes more then ill call the commissioner very wise master robin doubtless the police will inaugurate a most effective search hot diggity here he comes now  what happened batman  penguin almost outfoxed me good heavens sir you look as if youve been in some sort of nasty snare oh it was nothing alfred you might go up and tend to my clothes though theyre in rather rocky shape very good sir the point is our scheme to bug the penguins lair wont work well have to solve the mystery of the batbrella ourselves right lets muster all of our brain power the stroke of lets see how my gimmick is working gosh batman this is sure a tough one jumping jiminys its the boy wonder its my most dazzling stroke a secret radio transmitter built into the handle of the batbrella i wonder if these colors mean anything colors are certainly striking could it be the penguins way of taunting us with a clue to where hes going to strike hey youve got something this green could stand for money or emeralds or is it all the colors taken together you mean like a collection of gems the jeweled meteorite on display at the museum wow studded with emeralds and diamonds and rubies the penguins favorite bird seed could he get at it though well check the plans of the museum what did i predict batman has picked our crime next hell tell us how to do it youre a real genius shhhh gotham city museum third floor plan impossible burglar proof not even the penguin could get through those security devices scratch the jeweled meteorite back to the batbrella curses that sounded like a sweet caper fear not dear finks i know batmans fertile mind hell come up with another i still think the clue must be in the colors theyre so pretty its like a beautiful dawn beautiful dawn huh dawn robbins the beautiful movie star shes on location here in gotham city holy popcorn could he be planning to kidnap her dawn robbins in a picture called the mockingbird produced by ward eagle and shes staying in the penthouse at the pelican arms birds in every bush a penguin

umbrellas gosh yes hes got all that equipment readymade in his criminals storeroom its a fiendish welllaid scheme only were onto it right whatll we do tip off commissioner gordon no not on your life

ah well one never knows what lurks around lifes corner ms robbins here we are right under dawn robbins penthouse terrace gosh batman its high pretty tough throw for the bataring huh good point better use the batzooka aha its just like batmans blueprint theres robbins nest across the way lets get to work ready with the batzooka what was that sounded like a batzooka the dynamic duo they just fired the famous batrope bulls eye the hook caught the railing of the terrace yeah the games going exactly as i planned lets get to work thanks wilbur get those prints to mr eagle hell be expecting them i going up the air its stuffy in here wait ill get you a wrap if you catch a cold itll cost mr eagle countless thousands oh what a boring humdrum life this is im not even a person im merely a commodity like soap its like  eek oh help theres guys from outer space dont be alarmed ms robbins were not law breakers were here to protect you maam great scott the caped crusader and the boy wonder who being a stranger to gotham city of course you wouldnt know batman and robin ace crime fighters oh geewhiz batman youre kinda cute could you use some publicity im sorry ms robbins forget it batman never

ink start the winch whatll we do now batman if we could just get our utility belts off holy flypaper what a fix victory for the tricky birds the dynamic duos darkest hour dawngone one dawn gone  but then another comes so this was the clue which allowed you to anticipate the penguins crime huh  a fat lot of good it did enough mr jay who could possibly have foreseen the penguins appointment of a gigantic magnet hes right commissioner we failed and how if that waiter hadnt come in at midnight we might still be stuck there i say pay the ransom i say nothing matters but dawns safety and mr eagles shooting schedule i agree with mr jay were the first private plane do you have the money right here in this suitcase batman two hundred thousand dollars in unmarked bills of small denominations chief ohara give us a summary of the penguins ransom instructions once again well its a trade sir you see the dough for ms robbins hell pick the suitcase and leave the girl in its place unharmed says he but for the effect of a mild anesthetic mmhmm when and where a neutral spot he suggests the front hall of wayne manor as commissioner douglas knows thats the beautiful home of bruce wayne the millionaire mr wayne and i are close ive dined there often the time is to be  this morning if we agree were to fly a red gas balloon from the statue of george washington in gotham square what do you think batman we have no choice i buy it yes yes gladly alright chief you arrange for the balloon ill call bruce and speak to him begging your pardon sir but ive taken the liberty of doing that myself already uh what did mr wayne say it was the butler i spoke with mr wayne and his ward are away fishing good lets deliver the ransom money ourselves batman right robin well do even better i seem to remember a picture in the gotham city times some society affair inside the front hall of wayne manor arent there two suits of ancient armor  yes of course i get it well hide inside the armor soon as the girl is safe we pounce right again robin the last trick of this tricky hand is ours will the penguin and his finks have the last laugh yes sir what can i sleep tight my little ones by the time you awake in  hours ill be safe in my hideaway in alaska who was that at the door alfred if its the cleaning man  oh alfred oh close the door well divide the loot and well fly our separate ways wrong penguin youll all fly together up the river you birds of a filthy feather you betrayed yourself at the penthouse you used the very same words id spoken in the batcave we found out about your secret radio transmitter we acted out a charade to trap you bbbut the gas  i put you to sleep in the armor i saw it a trap dummies in that armor we were here all the time alright boys our umbrellas saints alive no chief ohara not saints alive four birds bagged tell warden crichton they keep better on ice oh come on aunt harriet just one more hors doeuvres huh after all that shrimp salads no indeed dick grayson im not going to see you have nightmares its bad enough that our peaceful home was involved in a wicked crime last week my oh my if youd seen what i saw you see dick and i were off fishing you really know as much about it as i do youve read it in the papers perhaps youd like to wander over there and ask commissioner gordon the origin of the batcostume ladies and gentleman is simple as batman realized when he set out on his crusade nothing so strikes terror into the criminal mind as the shape and shadow of a huge bat ah ms robbins mr jay im so delighted you could come our host ms robbins mr bruce wayne head of the famous philanthropic wayne foundation you dont say gosh whats the matter with that gorgeous girl her manner did seem a trifle odd the lingering effects of that
