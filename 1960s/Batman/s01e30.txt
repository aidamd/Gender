batman so far we have seen at the dedication of a new bridge. murder. and spotted in the crowd, that sinister crook, the bookworm. great scott. a bookworm ploy. a ruse to divert the dynamic duo while a bomb was placed in the batmobile. bomb detected. ejected. a clue. he was going to blow up the bridge. he did. he blew it up. into a giant photograph. like moths, our heroes followed the light. into a battrap. was this girl really a prisoner. was it a trick. one way to find out. put her gently to sleep. spirit her into the batcave. test her. counter plot. pretend we fall for her game. the tricky girl turned the tables. and the bookworm knew just what to do with him. bind him to the clapper of a giant bell. do not ask for whom this bell tolls. it tolls for robin. in just one minute, a stroke of midnight doom. batman batman batman batman batman batman batman batman batman batman na na na na na na na na na batman a few minutes earlier, even as bookworm binds robin to the clapper of the giant bell batman races across gotham city in the opposite direction. hot on a trail that's fatally false. what's up, chief o'hara. we've searched that hall from cellar to weathervane. not a trace of the bookworm. but how can that be. oh, worse news, too, batman. you know that alley way where you said we'd find the boy wonder. aguarding bookworm's ma. yes. yes. don't tell me. you guessed it. great heavens. i better try to contact robin instantly on the utility belt wavelength. robin. robin. do you receive me. robin. over. the tricky devils. they've turned the tables and caught robin. i'll call headquarters. throw out the drag net. no, wait a minute, chief o'hara. let meturn my memory back. "he strikes at midnight. . " she said. but we know the bookworm's changed his plan. don't interrupt. i'm trying to fathom the subconscience of a deadly criminal. "he strikes at midnight. " a metaphor. . suggests a clock. a clock called he. of course. and there's only one clock in gotham city that is called he. saints alive. big benjamin. in the wayne memorial clock tower. and it fits in with the plan. "do not ask for whom the bell tolls. it tolls for thee. " you mean. exactly. and if my surmise is correct. . the ghastly fate that bookworm planned for me he's twisted to robin. chief o'hara, we haven't one big benjamin second to lose. mere seconds before he strikes. i'll shoot out the works. ah, didn't even dent it. no time for a batclimb. we have one last desperate chance. help me setup the batzooka. the lightning rod on top. fire. bullseye. second shot, the hands of that clock. fire. mother mcree. done it again. quickly. now, to get the ends of these two conductive lines. what are you doing, batman. attaching these lines to the nuclear power source. both lines to the positive terminal. as you may recall from school like charges of electricity repel each other. now, to rev up the power turbines. i still don't get it, batman. pray. pray, chief o'hara. . that the clapper and the bell will be positively charged. and thus repel each other. i hope so, batman. i hope so. funny, all i hear is a nightingale. inconceivable, but true. the precocious pest has escaped us. but how could he, bookworm. how could he. how could he. i can not conceive, but from gill blas translated by tobias smollett book 10, chapter three. . quote "facts are stubborn things. " unquote. now the fact is. . that our bats have flown the belfry unaccountably still squeaking. gee. and us, with our supercrime not pulled yet. ha. do not fret, my sweet lydia. oh, do not fret. my brain drenched mind has done it again. a most delicious battrap. mwah. and in wayne manor, stately home of millionaire bruce wayne and his youthful ward, dick grayson the plot is about to take a strange new twist. oh, what is it, alfred. it's a gentleman from the book mobile service, madam. oh, how nice. bring him in. this way, sir. how do you do. what do you recommend this week. something for reading before going to sleep. oh, well, i believe you will find this volume extremely effective, mrs. cooper. congressional record, march 1919. oh, it's the illustrations, mrs. cooper. they are so picante. oh, you don't say. look, alfred. hmm. . oh. subject found to be member of. . yes, commissioner. uh, bookworm has struck again, batman. brazenly.

' goodbye, commissioner. aunt harriet and alfred. they're not hurt, he said. our duty is to the public. let's go. what a twisted scale of events. typicalof the frustrated author bookworm is. over plotting. 'either the robbery or a giant cookbook' would have attracted our attention. foolish amateur. has to try both. holy toad. back, everybody. back. back. take cover at the side streets. take cover at the side streets. the recipes in this book could be explosive. stay back. i bet it's hollow inside, batman. we'll soon find out. let's probe it with our high energy radar. roger. 'hollow, alright. ' yes. judging from the rate of reflection the cover contains high tensile steel. let's open it up, batman. right you are. if the cover contains steel we can do it from a safe distance using the super powered batmagnet. great. i'll work the power supply. roger. batpull, 1200 pounds. make it a ton. oh, poor puny little batbrains. i bet they think they opened that book. but will they go in. of course, they'll go in. in the words of the poet. .

'bookworm, what are you up to.' it's a curious old recipe i discovered in the alchemist cookbook, vienna, dated 1534. 'how to steam a bat. ' i think he means it. 'of course, i mean it, boy wonder. ' 'watch now, while i turn up my radio controlled double boiler. ' double for dynamic duo. 'cook well, my bateared friends. 'while you are stewing down, i shall be pulling off' 'the crime of the century with the aid of your batmobile. ' happy juices. quick, let's fly. batman to gotham city police. batman to gotham city police. red alert. red alert. we're trapped inside a cookbook at fifth and cedar. red alert. do you receive me. over. no answer. these high tensile steel walls they're cutting down our transmission. i'll get out my laser beam cutting torch. don't, robin. no, no. it would super heat the steam and boil us in a split second. holy pressure cooker. only way to crack this thing would be the batbeam in the batmobile and bookworm has it. we even left the engine running. 'with all your might and mane, men. let's go.' they'll never get to us in time. there's only one hope. well. we're getting nowhere, chief. oh, harder, fellas. harder. oh, give me, give me that sledge, here. sounds like steam in there. drats . that fine pair of crime fighters boiled in the entrails of a monster cookbook. who could imagine a more tragic end. batman to batcave. what's the use, batman. it's just possible our own supersensitive antenna may pick up the signal where the police receivers could not. do you think alfred's there. he's a creature of well disciplined habits. it's his regular time for dusting the atomic pyle. batman to alfred. batman to alfred. this is an emergency. might i be of some assistance, sir. quick, alfred. point me into the voice actuated circuit of the master anticrime computer. certainly, sir. at once, sir. bookworm to bookmobile. bookworm to bookmobile. do you read me.

'armoring the walls but leaving the floor unprotected. ' how did they discover our objective. your talk in the batmobile was picked up by a secret mic. it was relayed to us via the automatic feedback circuit in our batcave. let's clean house, batman. now, robin. glasses off. alright. my fine twisty worms. attack. ho. you should've learned much sooner, miss limpet. the oldest plot, and still the best. crime. . does not pay. a check for $5000 for the state prison library. this is very generous of you, bruce. i thought it was the least i could do after reading about that dreadful business in the papers. uh, the bookworm affair. and i feel our prison libraries could use some new uplifting titles. yes. yeah, shocking. a man of bookworm's education. how could such a fellow turn to a life of crime. i'd say it's an example of the old precept. "a little knowledge is a dangerous thing. " a wise observation, bruce. i'll remember that. uh, would you like to see him. bookworm. he's just outside waiting conveyance to the penitentiary. gosh, bruce, i'd sure like to see a real crook in the flesh. well, i don't see any harm in it, dick. as long as he's under sound restraint. get them, chief o'hara. yes, sir. them. his female accomplice, too. a miss limpet. very sad case, that one. alright, bring 'em in. come on, boys. alright, you crooks, and remember be polite to mr. bruce wayne, too.
