sure is a groovy day for a beach party. l'll say. shag, how you coming with the surf fishing. not even a nibble. scooby, have you had any luck yet. you bet. hot dogs. where did you catch them. watch. hey, that's our lunch basket. now, why didn't l think of that. scooby, that was, like, the one that got away. very funny. come on, shag. let's dance. just one more cast. l got a feeling l'll catch something this time. using a toy mouse for bait. sure. what better way to catch a catfish. lt figures. hey, l must have, like, hooked moby dick. give me a hand, scoob. oh, boy. oh, boy. oh, boy. lt must weigh a ton. zoinks. what's that. lt's a caveman frozen in ice. l wonder where this frozen fright floated in from. l know. l read about it in the paper. scientists found this 2millionyearold caveman in the arctic. a research vessel was taking him to oceanland. . . . . . when he was lost overboard during a storm at sea. am l glad he's frozen in there and that we're out here. he won't stay frozen for long. we've got to get him to oceanland. . . . . . so scientists can put him in the cooler before he melts. melts. so we didn't waste any time. . . . . . bringing the caveman here to oceanland, professor. professor lngstrom and l wish to thank you. . . . . . for rushing our frozen friend to us. you're welcome. we're glad to get rid of him. what would have happened if l hadn't hooked that prehistoric ice cube. with the prevailing current, it would've drifted down to oceanland anyhow. shouldn't you put him in a refrigerator. yes, yes. we'll store him in the arctic room. lt's very cold in there. wouldn't it be an amazing achievement. . . . . . if we could bring the caveman back to life. lf you don't mind, we like him just the way he is. well, we got to be going. come on, scoob. let's go. coming. sorry, madam. hey. wait for me. lt's getting late, professor wayne. are you coming. no, professor lngstrom. l still have some work to do on these notes on arctic plankton. very well. l'm going down to the dock. l have some. . . . some research to do. boy, was that good. you bet. lsn't there anything more to eat. just two slices of bread and an old ice cube. l'll take it. speaking of ice cubes. . . . . . l wonder how our frozen friend is doing. zoinks. l just remembered, l left my rod and reel at oceanland. well, it's not too late. we'll drive back and get it. this place is spooky at night. professor wayne. professor lngstrom. they must've gone home for the night. we'll have to come back tomorrow. yeah, yeah, yeah. let's go. wait a minute. get a load of this door. lt's been ripped right off its hinges. lt looks like somebody or something was in a big hurry to get out. but what. there's only one way to find out. yeah. we'll go home and read about it in tomorrow's paper. that's not what l had in mind, shaggy. come on. jumping jellybeans. lt looks like this room's been hit by a cyclone. hey, look. professor wayne's fur parka. lt's been torn up. but where's professor wayne. what l want to know is, where is the caveman. look. he's gone. but that's impossible. not if he came to life, it isn't. that does it. l'm calling the sheriff. got to get the sheriff. shaggy. broken. shaggy. don't bother me now, scoob. hello, sheriff. hello. hello. this phone's busted. why didn't you say something, scoob. oh, boy. there's something peculiar about this block of ice. . . . . . melting in the arctic room. maybe this heater explains why. lt's been turned on. but why would anyone want to bring that creep to life. l don't know, but we're gonna find out. hey, look. footprints. and, like, look at the size of them. extralarge caveman. we're in luck. we can follow them right to him. can't you, scooby. l can. you heard the lady. let's go. l've heard of holding someone's hand when they're scared. . . . . . but this is ridiculous. look. the footprints end at the edge of the dock. and take a look who's out on the dock. professor lngstrom. what's he doing with that strange equipment. this scene is getting creepier by the minute. ls he talking to the fish, or am l dreaming. you're not dreaming, l don't think. scooby, sneak up closer and see if you can tell what he's up to. me. like, you're the only scooby here. . . . . . thank goodness. so far, so good. who's there. that must have been the wind. scoob, look out for those pails. scooby, are you all right. professor lngstrom sure acted suspiciously. l'll bet he's up to something. and it's our job to find out what. come on. let's take a look in that shack. lt's the caveman. let's get out of here. faster, velma. faster. zoinks. we're goners. let's, like, find someplace to hide. boy, was that close. too close. come on. we better see what happened to shag and scoob. zoinks. now you really got him mad. we've looked almost everywhere, but still no sign of shaggy and scooby. l hope bigandugly didn't find them. not a chance. lf l know those two chickens. . . . . . they're miles away from the caveman by now. zoinks. well, like, l always wanted to take a spin around oceanland. look. we've landed on the tail of a whale. still no sign of shag and scooby. correction. here they come. help. and there they go. like, help. shaggy, scooby, are you all right. yeah, but now l know how a baseball feels. . . . . . when it's knocked out of the park. me too. this whole mystery's got me puzzled. first professor wayne vanishes, then lngstrom disappears. . . . . . and finally, that frozen fright appears big as life. l bet lngstrom and his machine had something to do with it. maybe this clue l found will give us some answers. like, what is it. an ocean chart. and look. this line drawn from the spot marked x. . . . . . follows the current right to oceanland. she's right. our next step is to find out what's out there. you mean, like, you're going out there where x marks the spot. wrong. you're going out there with velma and scooby. daphne and l will try and find out what the caveman's up to. shaggy, steer three degrees to starboard and then seven degrees to port. l'm nervous enough. just simple ''turn left'' or ''turn right'' will do. we should just about be there. keep a sharp lookout, scooby. look. look. dead ahead. a spooky old fishing boat. and it's anchored where the x is marked on the chart. lt seems to be deserted. this is our chance to search for clues. oh, boy. with our luck, we'll probably find a ghost crew. nothing in there. a horrible creature. oh, scooby, it's only me. now, come inside, and let's look around. what kind of clues are we looking for. anything unusual or mysterious. you mean, like doors slamming and locking behind us. what am l saying. lt did slam and did lock, and we're trapped. and that's not all. look. an ice machine. and somebody turned it on full blast. hey, wait a minute. this is a clue. the caveman was frozen in ice. we're gonna be next if we don't get out of here. we haven't much time. somebody better think of something fast. here's a scooby snack, scoob. think of something. what's he doing with those ice tongs. l don't know, but give him room. he's gonna build up speed and ram the door with the block of ice. go, scooby. go. look out, scoob. oh, no. he's losing control. that ice hit the keyhole so hard it was forced through in the shape of a key. see if you can reach it, scooby. and, like, hurry. okay. hurry, scooby. the ice is piling up. hurry, scoob. hurry. lucky that key worked. and just in time. come on. let's go back to oceanland. . . . . . and tell the others what we found. l'm for that. whoever locked us in the cabin wants to be double sure we don't get ashore. but don't worry. l've got a hot idea. you call this a hot idea. keep paddling, shaggy. this is no time to get cold feet. lt's not cold feet l'm worrying about. well, we have pieces to this puzzle, but we don't know how they fit together. l figure the only way to figure out this mystery is to capture the caveman. l figured that's what she'd figure. now, here's my plan, shaggy. all you and scooby have to do. . . . . . is find the caveman and let him chase you through that doorway. and when you do, we simply drop the net on him. like, what safer way to sneak up on an old gruesome. . . . . . than disguised as a couple of fish. zoinks. hold it. there he is now. okay, scoob, do your stuff. here goes. bull'seye. feetl mean fins, let's go. zoinks. he's gaining on us. help. help. l think l hear them coming. daphne, don't lean over so far. help. help. hey, like, what happened. dangerprone daphne did it again. oh, no. here comes trouble. let's get out of here. someone get me out of here. hey, like, he can talk. let's pull him out, shag, and see who he really is. all together, pull. lt's professor wayne. you mean to say this whole caveman thing was a hoax. not entirely, sheriff. the 2millionyearold caveman lost at sea was for real. and that's what gave professor wayne the idea for his scheme. first he froze the dummy caveman in a block of ice out at the old fishing boat. he set it adrift, knowing it would float to oceanland. then he melted the ice with an electric heater and made it appear the caveman came to life and caused he and ingstrom to vanish. once lngstrom was out of the way, wayne would return. . . . . . claiming to have escaped from the caveman. but why did he do it. l can answer that. he was after my invention. a revolutionary marinelife communicator. like, wow. you mean you can talk to fish with it. scoobydoo. scoobydoo. scoobydoo. that invention is worth a fortune. lt would have been mine if it weren't for those meddling kids. well, where you're going. . . . . . you won't have to worry about meddling kids anymore. that wraps up this mystery. let's head for the malt shop. what are we gonna do with old, tall, dark and dummy. like, l got an idea. that was a clever idea you had, shaggy. yeah, like, scoob needed a dance partner. . . . . . and he couldn't have gotten a better one. l gotta admit, scoob has style. yeah. he's all over the floor. sdl media group  )
