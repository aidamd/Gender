'' come on, gang. lt's time we head for home. yeah, l wanna catch the early late show on tv. lt's called i was a teenage blob. l saw that. boy, was it corny. the blob would hide in the back of cars and wait for his victims. this creepy shortcut you're taking, freddy, gives me the chills. yeah. like, me too. that's because the heater is broken. scooby, fetch the beach blanket so we can bundle up. okay. excuse me. like, what is it, scoob. l think he's had too many ice creams. a ghost. look. the ghost is going into the marshes. did you get a look at his face. yeah. he'd make a fortune renting himself out to halloween parties. that's not what l meant. that's the ghost of mr. hyde. you mean that creepy jewel thief who's been scaring everybody in town. the very same. like, l wonder what hyde was doing hiding in the mystery machine. well, there's one way to find out. come on, let's follow him. he went into that spookylooking old house. they always do. don't tell me you're scared. me, scared. like, don't be silly. then why are you biting scooby's nails. so l am. sorry, scooby. come on. let's see if we can find a back way into that creepy old place. hey, the back door is unlocked. this is gonna be easier than we thought. what happened. what was that. like, wouldn't you know that back door would trigger a trap door. yeah, and look where we landed. right in the middle of a mad scientisttype laboratory. lt must belong to the ghost of hyde. zoinks. someone's coming. hey, that's not hyde. what are you kids doing here. would you believe we're looking for a ghost. that's how we ended up in your lab, dr. jekyll. boy, are we glad you didn't turn out to be mr. hyde. yeah. glad. well, kids. . . . . . l'm not so sure l'm not the ghost. what do you mean, dr. jekyll. like my greatgrandfather, the first dr. jekyll. . . . . . l may also be changing into the horrible mr. hyde. . . . . . but this time as his ghost. ghost. ghost. but how, sir. for the past three years. . . . . . l've been working on a vitamin formula. . . . . . that you only have to take once in your life. last week, l perfected it. and all that was left to do was to test it. but something must have gone wrong. i became dizzy. and the room began to spin. several hours later, i was awakened by my housekeeper, helga who found me on the floor. l had fresh mud on my shoes, like l'd been out in the marsh. the same thing happened tonight. and when l awoke, l found these in my pocket. that's the necklace we saw the ghost of hyde holding. that's real. so you see. . . . . . there is no doubt that l am the ghost of hyde. there's one thing that puzzles me. lf you were in the swamp, how come the mud on your shoes is dry. that is strange. there's something strange about this whole thing. we'd like to find out what it is. not me. freddy said to search the place from top to bottom. wouldn't you know we'd be the ones to search the attic. like, this place looks like a storeroom for spiderwebs. wow, a spooky room filled with haunted spiderwebs. . . . . . and creepy, oldlooking chests. wonder what's in them. funny place to keep bats. hope they've all, like, flown the coop. there's nothing in here but a bunch of old costumes. somebody around here must have been in show biz. shaggy. yeah. zoink. very funny. don't take it off. you look better with it on. now, quit fooling around and help me search. you look on that side, and l'll look on this. yipe. nothing in that one. what's with you, scoobydoo. that horriblelooking. come on. we'll sneak up on him. get ready, scoob. l'm gonna open the door. gotcha. oh, scooby, you were only looking at yourself in a mirror. this place is creepy. like, all we're missing is a big, old, scary shadow. shaggy, look. zoinks. the door is stuck. lt won't open. shaggy. coming, scoob. we're goners. friends of the doctor's, no doubt. you must be helga. we thought you were the ghost of hyde. well, you can see l'm not. and you've made a mess of the attic just after l finished cleaning it. cleaned it. like, l wonder what it looked like before she cleaned it. l hope shaggy and scooby are having better luck than we are. wait a minute. l think l found a clue. looks like someone was in a hurry to burn something in the fireplace. lt's an old newspaper clipping. and listen to this. humanfly act. yeah. lt's a daring acrobatic act done on tall buildings and other high places. why should a circus star be working as a housemaid in a creepy place like this. l don't know. maybe one of these books will give us a clue. maybe. here's one. a hundred and one ghosts and ghouls. zoinks. we hit the jackpot. hi, kids. uncle happy time here, once again, with your favorite dog star. . . . . . king of the wild blue yonder. hi, kiddies. lf you don't sign the treaty, running dog. . . . . . we'll take back the trinkets and beads. lndian giver. then go. you know, you ought to get this set fixed. this chute leads to the laundry room. l wonder what's down there. l wonder what's happened to shag and scoob. we haven't heard a peep out of them. look out below. duck. a perfect threepoint landing. you mean fourpoint landing. what were you running from in the first place. old horrible hyde. you saw him. ln glowing color. like, dr. jekyll must have changed again. he couldn't have. we just saw him reading in his study. hey, shaggy. look. lt looks like someone was ironing a shirt with muddy shoes. you mean it looks more like someone was hiding a pair of muddy shoes. and where did this feather duster come from. that's the one helga was cleaning spiderwebs with. that's the one. velma. shaggy. scooby. are you guys all right. couldn't be better. we found a clue. yeah. clue. and l have a hunch we'll find a few more answers. . . . . . to this mystery in helga's room. helga's room. here it is. come on. let's go in. lf you don't mind, l'll wait out here and guard this bowl of fruit. guard it. sure. what safer place than in my stomach. come on, scoob. so far, no luck. let's see what's under the mattress. hey, look, a can of phosphorus paint. and a bottle of knockout drops. are you thinking what l'm thinking, freddy. l'm thinking this mystery is pretty close to being solved. we better tell dr. jekyll what we found. hey, gang, did l find something interesting in the fruit bowl. the ghost of hyde. and he's got shaggy. shaggy. they're gone, vanished. come on. we've got to find him, and fast. shaggy. shaggy. what are you gonna do with me. you're gonna turn me into a frog. like, l think he's going to croak me. scoobydoo, where are you. shaggy. l wish l had a scooby snack. shaggy, scooby. thank goodness you're safe. you mean thank scooby we're safe. what l'd like to know is why hyde was after you, shag. maybe he was, like, after these suction cups. l found them in the fruit bowl. sounds pretty silly to me. what would he want with suction cups. beats me, but with the clues we have so far. . . . . . it's for sure the ghost of hyde is a 24carat phony. and we know who that we do. now it's our turn. . . . . . to scare the hide off of hyde. the plan's working, scoob. we'll lure him into the trick trap. no. ghosts. lt worked. ghosts. he's headed for the back door. and the trap door. we got him, scooby. scoobydoo. nice catch, guys. now to unmask this phony hyde. and if our calculations are right, it should be helga, the housemaid. dr. jekyll. so it really was dr. jekyll behind the ghost of hyde jewel robberies. lt sure was, sheriff. when all his crazy experiments failed. . . . . . dr. jekyll decided to turn to a life of crime. but one thing he didn't count on was us following him into the marsh. and, like, when he figured he might be caught. . . . . . he came up with the idea of framing helga, the maid. shame on you, dr. jekyll. first he told us that phony story about the formula. then he planted fake clues for us to find. . . . . . that would make it look like helga was the ghost of hyde. his plan almost worked, except that shaggy found the suction cups. . . . . . which turned out to be the real clue. when he tried to get them back and keep shag from telling. . . . . . everything backfired, and he ended up caught in one of our traps. why were the suction cups such an important clue. show him, scoob. okay. dr. jekyll had to use the suction cups to scale the buildings. lf helga was the ghost of hyde, she wouldn't have needed them. . . . . . because she was an excircus star. hey, like, look. scoob thinks he's a circus star too. oh, no, scooby's gonna fall. l gotta admit, that's some act.
