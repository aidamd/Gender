 when we last left blast ketchup and friend they were searching for the legendary, mystical and maybe nonexistent tiny'mon, screechereen.  blast, nobody knows if screechereen even exists and we have been searching a long time and i would like a sandwich.  they'll never find screechereen.  don't be so negative.  ..  look.   a bad kid who will want to battle me, 'cuz that is what our show is about.  i love tiny'mons.  and nobody can beat blast ketchup and kadoomerang.   kadoomerang, go.   awk.  blast ketchup: ha, ha. yes, i have won.   johnny and dukey: yeah.  awww.  johnny, do something else besides watch tiny'mon.  go outside and play a game or something.  .. kadoomerang.  .. cuddlebuns.  cuddlebuns. he stinks.  you can't train him and he can barely fly.  i know, but he's so cute.  battle.    you're right. cuddlebuns stinks.  johnny, this is not what i meant.  but, dad, i'm training to be a tinymon master, so i can snag more tiny'mons so i can catch the legendary screechereen, which may or may not exist.  johnny, there are only two things in this world i don't understand, and that's women and tiny'mon.  and you need to stop playing or you'll get lost inside your own tiny'mon world and never come out.   we're going to the lab, aren't we.  forget it, johnny.  johnny: just use the staticanimator.  you brought my video game character "smash badger" to life.  so, why can't you just reverse it and put us in a video game.  like tiny'mon.  because it doesn't have "reverse".  so just put a reverse on it, like in a car, and hook up my gamedroid and send us in the game.   ha.  you don't know science like we do, johnny.  we can't just attach a car transmission and put the static animator in reverse.  can we.    dukey: careful, it's heavy.   take the emergency brake, too, in case we have to stop the experiment fast.  heeeyagh.  okay, let's throw this puppy in reverse.     johnny: yahbrrlllaa. woohoo.    both: we're such geniuses. )
