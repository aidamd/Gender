touches on our next plan to take over the world. according to the farmer's almanac, the earth will experience a lunar eclipse on june 8th. according to entertainment tonight, larry linville and brian doyle murray turn 63 today. happy birthday, boys. observe. i have altered this magnet for the purposes of this demonstration. the real apparatus will be thousands of times larger. now, during the lunar eclipse, i shall magnetically harness the moon to the earth, giving me complete control over its rotation. pinky, throw that ball bearing up in the air. narf. that ball bearing represents the moon. i am the earth. the lamp is the sun. and i shall control the amount of sunlight the earth will receive at any given time. get it. absolutely. not. once i control the earth's sunlightaah. aah. i will become the most powerful being in the milky way, which by default makes meyaah. a big chewy nougat. yes, pinky. that's what i was going to say. ha ha. i'm learning. yes. either that or i'm completely wiped. now come. to succeed in our plan, we must create a superconductive hydromagnetic beam inside that mechanically modified aquatic tank. whoosh. right over my little mousey head, brain. quiet. to create the ultraelectromagnetic induction, i must place millions of tiny magnets at the bottom of the tank. whoosh. steerike 2. now, each tiny magnet costs 2. 5 cents. one million at 2. 5, plus tax, comes to a total of what. steerike 3. i'm out. $25,963. 13. i have just under 3 bucks. pinky, what do you have on you right now. brut for men. and not a penny to your name. no. but i smell

a job. wait. get a job. pinky, are you pondering what i'm pondering. i think so, brain, but zero mostel times anything will still give you zero mostel. no, pinky. i'll get a job. with my intellect, i should have no problem landing a ceo position in a major corporation that pays $25,000 a week post taxes. look at all these jobs. now to find the highestpaying one that i can land. pinky: how's that batter coming, brain. oh, who cares. on our salaries, we'll be lucky if we have 25 grand by the time the sister sister twins apply for medicare. hello, sir. welcome to hot dog on a hot dog. how may i
