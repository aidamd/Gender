world itself is at stake. but we can't risk revealing ourselves to someone who lives in the vicinity. we must concoct a disguise so cunning our neighbor would never suspect that we are 2 lab mice bent on taking over the world.  greetings, neighbor. we're the feldmans. feldman. i didn't know i had neighbors. not since that nice mr. carlisle exploded. yes. uh, my name is mr. feldman. and i am the lovely and sociable mrs. vera feldman. we live in the bluehued structure just round the bend. the laboratory. uhit was a laboratory. it went condo last year. my name is sultana. what's your first

thinking. the storm's due to hit within 8 hours. if we don't secure that nub, we'll end up like like the crumbs that occupy the corner of my eye. in a manner of speaking. what do we do now, brain. we must win the neighborly trust of mr. sultana, and then convince him i am mr. the brain. faster. cut the grass, cut the grass. no. your munching is quite haphazard. hello, mr. sultana. it's me, the neighborhood welcome wagon bringing you a potted posy and a bowl of moldy jello. mrs. feldman means jello mold. really. in what language. hey, feldman, that's some nice tool you got there. thanks,

busey, every year he beat me out for the lead: the musical man in the music man, curly in oklahoma, hedda gabler. gee whiz, we're old high school chums. well, why not fetch my package for old purnell high's sake. i'll tell you what, my friend. if nobody claims package in 2 days, i'll give it to you. oh, that really chaps my pelt. pinky, are you pondering what i'm pondering. i think so, brain. but how will we get the spice girls into the paella. no, pinky, it's time to take drastic measures with this neighbor thing. the backyard barbecue. mmmmm, lovely mrs. feldman. them franks sure smell like a little piece of heaven. barry: yoohoo, the feldmans. remember, pinky, we must humor him, gain his trust, and then gain access to his house. i brought back your jello bowl. i washed it with my own 2 hands, which is a luxury i don't even afford myself. well, the world could use a few more mr. sultana sultanas. ay yi yi. that's some big tower you got there. what are you, trying to take over the world. heh heh heh. ha ha ha. ah ha ha ha. take over the world. when i got it, i can't get rid of it. quick, the feldmans, into your house. no, no, no. it's just been sprayed for, uh ticks. we're

package, mrs. feldman will distract mr. sultana by seducing him. oh, how wonderful. mr. sultana is so kind and caring and swarthy and tall, and mrs. feldman, mrs. feldman is me. narf. have faith, pinky. my meteorological calculations indicate this tempest is about to befall us. if we don't affix that red rubber nub pronto we'll suffer worse than a department store santa when rush limbaugh comes a sittin'. vivid, yet apropos. everything is hunky monkey. your juice is frothy like the snowman or a rabid dog. oh, for shame. i fear i must be leaving. so soon. i was just getting ready to show you my wet bar. it's sowet. isn't that always the way. well, toodles. farewell, barry. farewell, the lovely and nubile mrs. feldman. sorry, but some of my used clothing has become crunchy. well, barry um how about some music. oh, ok. hi, brain. narf.  oh, mrs. feldman, you are so lucky to have somebody. i'm a very lonely man. i wasn't always so charming and aloof. in the old days, i was young and bulbous. barry: where are you going. umfeed the meter. no, pinky, not yet. why do you run, joey, run. do i frighten you. oh, no, but lightning does. so, when i hear it, i run like lightning, which scares me even more, so i run even more lightning, uh. oh, i understand mrs. feldman. you are leaving me like every other woman. exactly. tata. barry: i understand. i know your feelings. mr. feldman

get that nub on the tower.  feldman, go away. i'm not wanting you to see me all broken up. ehh. ahh. hey, buckle up, big guy. there's plenty of fried fish in the ocean. when you fall off the horse, you gotta have or something. fine for you. you, who have everything. my life is like somebody who gets the pocket fisherman and then loses the pocket fish. poit. a wet suit. feldman, why was i not born more like you, all swank and snazzy. instead, i am the massive loser. all my life, i am the loserlosing my lunch, losing the hair off my back, and always losing out to that nogood gary busey for

radio tower. yes, like it, but completely different. now, what in the name of zantippy's bippy are you doing in that wet suit, and where is my rubber nub.. well, when i opened the box sultana gave us, it turned out to be this wet suit. oh, yes, the wet suit i ordered but never received for plan 2535409er, operation butterfat. so i became my own rubber nub. zort. commendably resourceful, pinky, but another lightning bolt could strike the top of that tower at any time. package for mr. the brain. i am mr. the brain.  and i have a special delivery telegram for a mr. sultana. i am mr. sultana. who could be special delivering me. come, pinky. we finally have our nub. but, brainnarf. don't you wanna see what mr. sultana's letter says. hmm hmm hmm. no time for that, pinky. we have to save the world so we can take it over. success, pinky. just in time for my radio address. now, when lightning hits the top of the tower, it will do no harm. egad. wonderful, brain. oh, no, wait. what if lightning hits the side of the tower. i hadn't thought of that. aah. aah. perhaps i'll be joining mr. sultana in that losers club for losers. oh, don't worry about mr. sultana, brain. here he comes to tell us about his newfound good fortune. good fortune. hello, my feldmans. i'd love to also play with jungle jimmy, but my ships have finally come in. listen to the special delivery i am having.
