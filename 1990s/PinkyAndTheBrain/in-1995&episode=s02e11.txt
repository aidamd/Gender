" ohhthey grow up so fast. yes. clones develop at a hyperaccelerated rate until reaching adult stature. oh. like michael crichton. and by the time i'm through with its training, it shall be cunning, ruthlessly brilliant, and possibly deadly. oh. like michael crichton. thermogalvanometer. magnetohydrodynamics. magneto hydro dynamics. odd. it was cloned from me. its intellect should be identical to my own. well, perhaps if you started with something less taxing to his little brain, brain. brain such as. pat the bunny. pinky, do you realize how that inane drivel could disrupt its neural programming. oh, fiddlyposh, i was raised on pat the bunny. sometimes you make it too easy for me, pinky. all right, roman numeral one, let's try it again. neurofibromatosis. uh neurofibromatosis. uhuh yes, that's it. let the command of language liberate your mind. uhuh uhh narf. narf. his first word, brainnarf. ha ha ha. romy: zort. fiddlyposh. pinky: narf. zort. fiddlyposh. egad. ohho, seconds. stop it, pinky, stop it. your influence is corrupting my prototype. but, brain pinky. uh, sorry, brain. i'll just sadly slink away, then, shall i. poit poit. something terribly wrong. i've gotgot to think.

" what is that. this. oh, taraxacum offinale.  stop. i'm terribly allergic. now, after careful analysis, i've concluded that your training is complete. for he's a jolly good fellowyou are now ready to assist me in my plan for world conquest. uh, yeah, yeah, about that, you see, ii've been pondering this whole, uh, "taking over the world" idea you got a jones for.  like, don't you see the narfness of it. uh, i just got to say pass, bro. what. what do you mean, pass. and who's this jones character. do we know his parents. i just want to do something a little, you know, more important with my life. no more talkytalk. lovely cake, yum yum. come and get it, ha. what, pray tell, is more important than taking over the world. i don't know, i just, uh i want to be a ventriloquist. a ventriloquist. oh, yes, of course. certainly that's a growth industry. perhaps you can use pinky as your dummy. oh, no, not me. i was blacklisted during the charlie mccarthy hearings. you see. no support. you treat me like some kind of lab experiment. you are a lab experiment. and what's wrong with that. i've been one all my life, and let me tell you, in my day, we didn't have it nearly as good. oh, he's right, romy. they used to keep us in a cage with an exercise wheel, feeding us nothing but pellets and water. it was horrible. cake. pinky, your head would make a wonderful ant farm. and you twobicker, bicker, bicker. it's like who's afraid of virginia woolf. i am. whoo. that woman gives me the willies. listen, mister, if you don't like things around here, hard cheese. my cage, my rules. glarb. glarb. what is glarb. this is your influence, pinky. me. oh, not once have i said glarb. oop. glarb. that's it. no more pat the bunny, no more moonwalk parties, no more games of "what's that smell." and no moreromy.  he's gone. he's run away. no, we drove him away. oh, brain. i'm turning out to be just like my mother. all white and covered with fur. you've got to go after him, brain. for gosh sake, he's your clone. i have no clone.   aah.  brain, you can't go on working yourself like this. you haven't eaten or slept since romy ran away. poit. i can't even remember what he looks like. oh, wait. it's coming back. no. no, can't remember. we must find my clone. hmm. i've taken us to every place a young runaway would go. m. i. t. , the franklin mint, pat harrington's dinner theater. apparently roman's not thinking like me. pinky, are you pondering what i'm pondering. i think so, brain, but pete rose. i mean, can we trust him. no, pinky. he must be thinking like you. hmm. let's see where would i go if i were running away. oh. oh. poit again, brain.   hey, herb, how about a game. yeah, ok, peaches. i got winner. hey, don mclean, the levee is dry. what are you, some kind of circus freak. yeah. i'm jojo, the thirsty boy. ok, but no checks this time. herb: hey, bunny. i told you, herbit's 'erb. we're through. then give me my ring back. all of them. you're making a big mistake, bunny. bunny. what are you looking at, youyou circus freak. circus freak, eh. leave the little guy alone. oh, bunny another freak. just like your last boyfriend. he wasn't a freak. oh, yeah. the bearded man who breathed air and floated in the water not a freak. and now this. ahemactually, i'm a cloned lab mouseherb, you're a psychotic, delusional paranoid with a protouser mentality and sadistic controller tendencies. it's 'erb. ow. he bit me. the circus freak bit me. that's right. now you're a circus freak. aah. anybody else want a little circus in their blood. aah. aah. aah. i've had my shots. bite me. yes.  well, all i can say is, girlfriend, if you want your child back, then you got to back your child, you know what i'm saying.  yes. well, be that as it may, young lady, we're simply here to let our young clone roman know we want him to come back home. whoo. i'm down with that. whoo. narf. pinky, please. talk to the hand. talk to the hand. and if it isn't too much trouble, miss lake, please ask your audience to refrain from addressing me as "girlfriend.
