redirect all global telephone communication into an endless voice mail system, and once a person is on the line, the array and amount of choices will render them occupied, busy, and unable to defend

bluffed by altering the molecular matrix through a substrate platform of microwaves. pinky. look, brain. i made a choochoo. and me without my video camera.  on the job accident, pinky. i've figured it out. in the office kitchen, i will simply stage an accident utilizing the microwave oven and the nondairy powdered creamer. for, no one really knows how a microwave works. but why the powdered creamer, brain. no one really knows how that works either. hey, professor. tuition's due.  whoa. look at this. hey, we got a freak here. are you some kind of freak. actually, i'm a lab mouse involved

"the boss" this and "the boss" that. la dee la dee da. narf. do you ever ask what i did today. very well, pinky. what did you do today. um can't remember. anything. not a thing. now i know how american gladiators stays on the air. pinky, you don't understand the pressures, the tension i'm under. you don't know what i'm up against, it's very difficult, the stressful tasks i face every day. am i the only person who makes coffee around here. oh, i'm sorry. that's my fault.  you're cute. you know what they saybig ears, big earmuffs. aheh. hi. i'm gina fallow. ii'm the, uh, mr. brain. oh, why, mr. brain, are you making a pass at me. no, no. i promise. i honestly don't find you attractive in any way. you creep. let go of me. let go. oh, dear. ugh. man: mr. brain. i'd like a word with you, please. in here. now. i can explain, sir. the young lady seems to have misunderstood me. i don't know what you're talking about. it's your resume. i've done some checking. neither princeton nor harvard have any record of you attending. oh. well, there must be some error. i have diplomas from both of those institutions. well, you better go get them and deliver them here pronto, mister, or your career in the world of rereinsurance is ooover. i find your manner unpleasant. working stinks. the time for action is upon us. ahem. help. help. oh, help. a terrible occupational disaster. brain: help. i've been maimed by an onthejob accident requiring massive workers' compensation.  woman: oh, my. man: it's mr. brain. he was in the cubicle next to me. ii've been turned into a mouse.  man: $1,614,000. we won't pay. in that case, my friend, i'll see you in court. second man: your honor, our sympathy goes out to mr. brain, but the amount he's asking for and the claim that he is a mouse, well, sir, they're both preposterous. mr. brain. your honor, to expedite matters, i wish to present these xrays of myself, clearly defining my mouse skeleton. my xrays. what happened to my xrays. there really is only one conclusion here. this man is a mouse. i'm afraid the only conclusion here, doctor, is that you have never seen these. i think this might keep you quiet. it might. your honor, i would like to begin by presenting some actual evidencethese 2 items recovered from mr. brain's cubicle. i ask you, when was the last time you heard of a mouse winning a bowling trophy or having an attractive family like this. ahh, pinky. yes. pinky, what are you doing here. egad. i had to come, brain. they're not covering this on court tv.  stay down. good thing they didn't find that mechanical suit, eh, brain. the suit. oh, dear heavens above, the suit. pinky, you must go to the office and get that suit from the kitchen closet. do you understand. if they find that, we're sunk.  you want me to help. oh, brain. go. aye, aye. aah. oof.  poit. narf. well, yes. i noticed his furry head, and i believe that's typical of his people. and what people would that be. uh, i'm not sure. i think they're from europe or maybe france. brain: objection, your honor. the size of my head and if i was a man before the accident is not the question here. the fact is, i am now a mouse.  your honor, i intend to prove that mr. brain is not a mouse but simply, and also sadly, just an oddlooking little man. oof. try the fruit rollumups. they're yummy. aah.   oh, i am doing well. poit. i call to the stand mr. brain. now, how exactly did the accident happen, mr. brain. a bizarre thing involving a microwave oven. i don't know exactly. no one really knows how they work. incorrect. in the oven, a magnetron produces microwaves which cause water molecules to align and reverse alignment, producing heat not mice. the accident also involved a nondairy powdered creamer. umoh. spectators: oh. whoa. whoa. whaha. narf. poit. mr. brain, in your experience with other mice, are they intelligent. whoa. aah. no. exactly. your honor, i contend that mr. brain is simply too intelligent to be a mouse. butno. no, i'mi'm not intelligent. i'm a simpleton. yes. like any average mouse. uh, narf. so you would have no problem with me saying that albert einstein was a champion surfer. what. i mean, no. or that the temperature of the sun is a comfy i wouldn't know. or that the fermidirac distribution function is a soup kitchen. that's preposterous. your honor, the fermidirac function is for any system of identical fermions in equilibrium, the probability that a quantum state of energy "e" is occupied. my word, man. don't you know your quantum statistics.  woman: he must be a man. man: he is smart.  all: ohhhh. oh, blunder. mr. brain, it is my ruling that your intelligence proves that you are not a mouse. and, that being the basis for your claim, i now dismiss charges against fiero and company.  very well. i'll go now. i'm afraid not. i find you guilty of fraud, perjury, and appearing naked in a public place. take him away. what. no. no. pinky: whoa. whoohoo. narf. i've got the suit. whoa. narf. i got it, brain. pinky. stop that man. hold it. put up your hands. oh. um, very well.  brain. pinky, down here. pinky. oof. um, excuse me. oh. oh, i'm sorry. i didn't mean to. ooh. pinky: just one more, then. careful, pinky. not too tight. i must be able to think freely so i can plan for tomorrow night. what, brain. what are we going to do tomorrow night. the same thing we do every night, pinkytry to take over the world. they're dinky they're pinky and the brain brain, brain, brain, brain captioning made possible by warner bros. captioned by the national ) )
