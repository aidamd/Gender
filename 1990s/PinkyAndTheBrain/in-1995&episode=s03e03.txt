gee, brain, what do you want to do tonight. the same thing we do every night, pinky, try to take over the world. they're pinky and the brain yes, pinky and the brain one is a genius the other's insane they're laboratory mice their genes have been spliced they're dinky they're pinky and the brain brain, brain, brain brain, brain, brain, brain, brain before each night is done their plan will be unfurled by the dawning of the sun they'll take over the world they're pinky and the brain yes, pinky and the brain their twilight campaign is easy to explain to prove their mousey worth they'll overthrow the earth they're dinky they're pinky and the brain brain, brain, brain brain, brain, brain, brain narf. warner bros. brain, voiceover: you may be wondering what a smart mouse like me is doing floating face down in a large body of water. well, you could say it's all a result of the misguided attentions i paid to a certain member of the fairer sex. pinky: poit. you mean, you're in the soup on account of a dame. yes, pinky, to use the vernacular. i suppose i should start at the beginning. the night began like any other. i'd hatched a scheme that was sure to take us straight to the top. pinky, the key to global conquest sits right on the top of your head. petroleum jelly. a little dab'll do ya. zort. no, pinky. neek. your hat. ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. behold the instrument of our conquest. egad. an amusement park for fleas. no. it's the miniature prototype for my greatest stroke of genius, pinky. the fedoramatic. observe. we shall divert the flow of the los angeles municipal water supply to a gigantic version of this mockup. ooh, a water park. will it have slippery slides and bumper boats. will it, brain. huh. huh. look closer and see, pinky. eek. zort. ha ha ha ha ha ha. yes, the fedoramatic works like a dream. i'll say. poit. i feel all tingly in a good way. oh. you would. but the more likely reaction will be panic and utter chaos. with the populace trapped in their hats, we shall seize los angeles and thenpomona. pomoegad. brilliant, brain. oh, but no, no, wait. what about people who don't wear hats. there are no people who don't wear hats. it's 1946. everyone wears hats all the time. now, come, pinky. we must travel to city hall and obtain the water rights for the fedoramatic from the council. how, brain. are we going to bribe them with captain midnight secret decoder rings. no, pinky. don't be too sure i'm as crooked as i'm supposed to be. besides, there's no reason the city council shouldn't look with favor upon the ambitions of a young lab mouse trying to take over the world. brain, voiceover: it couldn't fail. but then she walked back into my life.  billiea comely female specimen of consummate genetic design. pinky: is that like a real swell

i help her. well, it might have something to do with the time she rrrripped out your fragile heart, then smashed it into millions of tiny little pieces. yes. thank you, pinky. yes, and then squuuiiished them all up and ground them into pat. i get the picture. oh, and then she left you for that gerbily fellow calledsnowball: snowball. i told you never to say that name. i didn't say it, brain. then who did.  ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. oh, i'm sorry, brain. but i do so love it when you wail pathetically. and now that billie is mine again, i suppose you'll be doing nothing but wailing. oh,
