real animals.    oh, that kazoo sounds just like a penguin.  but i thought the penguins were really here and maybe a polar bear too.   the park is too warm for most penguins and polar bears, baby boppity bop.  because where they live, it's very, very cccold.  whoa.     when my teeth start to chatter    and my fingers freeze    that's how i know it's cold    when i shiver and shake from a
