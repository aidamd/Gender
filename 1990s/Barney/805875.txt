once upon a time, there lived a boy named aladdin.  he didn't have many toys, but he was happy.  one day, he found an old lamp.  he rubbed it, and a genie appeared.  "you set me free from the lamp," said the genie.  "i will grant you " aladdin asked for mounds of candy, piles of toys, and a big house.  "your wishes are my command," said the genie.  aladdin thought the wishes would make him ..  eating too muccandy made his tummy hurt.  and he had so many toys, he didn't know which to play with.  and the house was so big, he couldn't find his room.  aladdin didn't wthe candy or toys or the big house.  l he wanted was his friends and his family.  they made him very happy.  the end.  i don't know what i'd wish for if i had a magic lamp.  maybe we can wish ourselves to a faraway land.  you think so, barney.  your imagination can take you just about anywhere.  . your imagination .  . can take you anywhere you want to go .  . it's something you thought a lot .  . an idea you've got .  . could be big or small .  . imagine anything at all .   . now, just imagine .  . givit a try .  . come on, imagine .  . everybody reach for the sky .  .
