right over here.  okay.  hmm, let's see.   i better warn you, this thing is pretty scarylooking.  most spiders are harmless, but some of them do bite.  well, this one is big and creepy.  come on. it's not that big, david.  i've seen bigger ones.  well, tracy's right, david.  some spiders are even bigger than this.  yeah, that one's itsybitsy.  just like a spider we all know.  . the itsybitsy spider went up the water spout .  . down came the rain and washed the spider out .  . out came the sun and dried up all the rain .  . and the itsybitsy spider went up the spout again .   oh, my.   . the itsybitsy spider went up the water spout .  . down came the rain and washed the spider out .  . out came the sun and dried up all the rain .  . and the itsybitsy spider went up the spout again .  . .   oh, my.   . the itsybitsy spider went up the water spout .  . down came the rain and washed the spider out .  . out came the sun and dried up all the rain .  . and the itsybitsy spider went up the spout again .   oh, it sure did.  it may be itsybitsy, but i'm still not going anywhere near that thing.  it's best not to touch a spider unless you ask a grownup first.  hey, guys.  hey, b.j.  hey, riff.  what's everybody doing.  we're looking at a spider.  ) oh, cool.   ew. spiders.  sorry, but i do not like spiders.  they're icky, ucky, yucky, eepy, creepylooking.  i'm with you, riff.  well, you can't always judge something or someone by the way they look.  oh, i never do that, ..  except when it's a spider.  they're all creepy.  oh, this reminds me of a story about a creature everybody was afraid of until they got to know her.  what kind of creature, barney.  was it a big puffycheeked monster.  or a waggleeared bouncy beastie.  actually, it was a dragon.  a dragon.  would you like to hear the story.   well, it all started once upon a time.  it happened in a village a long, long time ago where no one had socks and they all had cold toes.   since they didn't have socks, their shoes didn't fit.  and they couldn't make socks, because no one could knit.  we have no sock inside our shoe.  and we do not know what to do.  except to sit and cry.   boo hoo. boo hoo. boo hoo.   aw.  now, the village had a shepherd boy, and his name was b.j.  he took care of all the sheep and watched them every day.  hmm.  now, where did i leave those sheep.  i wonder if they're in the forest.  i wouldn't go in the forest if i were you, shepherd b.j.  why not.  they say there's a dragon in there.  a dragon.   what kind of dragon.  a big one.  with great big teeth.  and a big, long tail.  and she breathes fire.   roar.  really.  well, that's what they say, anyway.  well, i'm not scared.  i'm going to go look.  huzzah.   .  good luck.  have fun.  here, sheep.  here, sheepy, sheepy, sheepy.  baa. baa.   i wonder where his sheep are.  here, sheepy, sheepy, sheep.  here, sheep.  oh, man.  is everything all right, .  not really.  my sheep are gone, and i'm scared to look for them because of the great big dragon with the long tail and the fire, and theoh, what should i do.  .  .  . what should i do when i don't know .  .  . should i make .  . should i cross my arms .  . should i count the ticktocks on my clock .  .  .  .  .  .   . what should i do .  . when i don't know .  .  . should i shout .  . should i ring my mom .  . i'm feeling so confused .  .  .  .  .   . what should i do .  . when i don't know .  .  .  .  .   . what should i do .  . when i don't know .  yup.  here, sheepy, sheepy, sheepy.  here, sheepy, sheepy, sheepy.   whoa, was that you, barney.  no, it wasn't me.  oh, who's there.  is that you, little sheepies.  barney, do you think it'sit'sthe dragon.   a dragon.  a knight.   barney.  oh, b.j.  hey, for a dragon, she's not so big and scary.  no, she certainly isn't.  and you don't look much like a brave knight.  i'm not a knight.  i'm a shepherd.  but the villagers always send brave knights to come and chase me away.  well, that's because dragons are mean and scary, and they breathe fire.  well, i'm not mean and scary, and i only use my fire to boil tea.  whoa, i never knew dragons liked to drink tea.  i like to have a cup while i knit.  here's a scarf i made.  ) oh, man.  that's great.  it's beautiful.  you like it.  it's yours.  oh, thanks.  i never knew dragons knitted too.  i like to sit and sing while i knit and have a cup of tea.  you like to sing.  i like to make music on my flute.  he does.   oh, that's beautiful too.  it sure is.  oh, it looks like the shepherd and the dragon are going to be the best of friends.  what do you and your friends like to do.   . .   . shoobee doobee doobee .  . best of friends is what we'll be .  . you'll see .  . shoobee doobee doobee .  . best of friends is what we'll be .  .   . i like you, and you

doobee doobee .  . best of friends is what we'll be .  .  . .  hi.   whoa.   . friend will share .  . a friend will care .  . a friend is someone who's always there .  . lose or win, you can count me in .  . we'll be friends through thick and thin .  . .   . shoobee doobee doobee .  . best of friends is what we'll be .  . you'll see .  . shoobee doobee doobee .  . best of friends is what we'll be .  .  best friends, that's what we are.  the best of the best.  hey, shepherd b.j.  have you seen any dragon.  help, dragon, help.  hey, come back.  you don't understand.  she's nice.  she knits.  that's what always happens.  now he'll tell the others, and they'll chase me out of my home.  oh.  barney, what can we do.  well, maybe you could tell your friends that she's a very nice dragon.  good idea.  now, don't go anywhere.  i'll be right back.  hey.  oh, it'll be okay.  ran to tell his friends they didn't need to fear.  but his friends wouldn't listen.  his friends wouldn't hear.  they called a knight to come and save the day.  brave sir riffalot would chase the dragon away.  sir riffalot went to find the beast and chase him far from here.  and when the shepherd b.j.  heard, he said: oh, dear. oh, dear.  oh, dear.  hi, barney.  well, hello, sir riffalot.  so where is this dragon.  oh, you don't understand, sir riffalot.  she's nice.  she's a great dragon.  ha.  there's no such thing.  dragons are icky, ucky, yucky, eepy, creepy.  not this one.  ah, they're all creepy, if you ask me.  barney, he doesn't believe me.  maybe he will when he meets the dragon.  where is she.  oh, i'm not scared of any dragon.  hello.  dragon.  ) oh, no.  i didn't mean to scare you.  you didn't.  well, i thought dragons liked to be scary.  not this one.  she likes to knit.  and sip tea.  and sing.  you like to sing.  i sure do.  i like to sing too.  this dragon is great.  that's what i've been trying to tell you.  and so sir riffalot found out that day this dragon was special in her own dragony way.  . you are special .  . you're the only one .  . you're the only one like you .  . there isn't another in the whole wide world .  . who can do the things you do .   .

are we going to do about the others.  they still think she's scary.  well, that's true, b.j.  yeah.  well, maybe you better leave and find another place to live.  but i don't want to leave here.  why not.  it's my home.  i wish that they could see.  i'm a really nice dragon.  i wish that they could see what a nice dragon i can be.  i'm sure we'd have some fun if they wouldn't turn and run.  . people think i'm scary, but stick around and see .  . i think you'll be surprised .  . at just how much fun i can be .  . i look a little scary, but i'm not .  . i may breathe a little fire but not a lot .  . and if you hear me roar, don't go runnin' for the door .  . i know i look a little scary, but i'm not .  . just because i am a dragon, it doesn't mean i'm mean .  . all i really want to do is be part of the team .  . i look a little scary, but i'm not .  . i may breathe a little fire but not a lot .  . and if you hear me roar, don't go runnin' for the door .  . i know i look a little

know a way dragon can stay.  .  what if sir riffalot pretends to chase the dragon away.  the villagers will think you ran away, and you can stay here and knit and sing and drink tea.   i'm sure he's here somewhere.  here they come.   oh, sir riffalot.  i'll go stop them.  b.j., you bring the dragon.  okay.  are you ready.  i think so.  remember, pretend to be scary.  i'll try.  come on.   i know

to all my friends.  i'm glad you came to play.  our fun and learning never end.  here's what we did today.  this morning everyone got scared when they saw a spider, and that reminded me of a story about some villagers who were scared by a dragon.  the villagers asked brave sir riffalot to chase the dragon away, but the shepherd boy found out this was a very nice dragon.  she liked to sing and knit and drink tea.  finally, everyone got to know the dragon, and they all became the best of friends.  and remember, i love you.           i can make a funny noise.  bllaaahh.     i can make the
