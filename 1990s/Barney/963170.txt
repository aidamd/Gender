emperor heard about ..   it would make me happy to hear her.  i will invite her to sing for me.   oh, the nightingale was so excited, she practiced her song all day.   but each time she sang, her big brother told her to sing differently.  ..   ..   sing low notes.    finally, the nightingale went to the palace to sing for the emperor.   thank you for coming.  please sing for me now.        but the emperor didn't like her song at all.  ..   i thought you had the best voice in all china, but i did not hear that today.   the nightingale's brother felt badly.   emperor, it is my fault.  please allow my sister to sing again, and you will be happy with what you hear.   all right.  let the nightingale sing again.       this time, the nightingale sang the song in her own way, and the emperor was very happy.     i'm the nightingale    shh.  sissy, you have to be quiet when you watch a puppet show.  you can't be so loud.  oh. oh, man.   oh, b.j.  you broke my lantern.  oh, barney.   are you
