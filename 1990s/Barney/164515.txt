 both: okay, jackson.  goodsmile.  great.  can i please take another picture, jackson.  sure, laura.  thanks.  okay, guys, how about a funny face.  both: yeah.  i can't wait to see that one.  : i

thanks, barney.  we've been using this cool camera my mom gave me.  the pictures come out right away.  oh, how neat.  barney, can i take a picture of you.  well, of course you can, but before i have my picture taken, i like to make sure that my teeth are nice and clean.  why.  if my teeth are clean, then it makes my smile brighter.  hmm...  what can we do to make our teeth clean and bright.  kids: brush them.  that's right.  but we need toothbrushes for that, barney.  oh, well, you mean like these.  kids: wow. toothbrushes.  let's all practice brushing together.  come on.  oh, this'll be great.  here we go.    oh, i'm brushing my teeth on top    it's so much fun, i hate to stop.   all:  but while i'm brushing my teeth and having so much fun    i never let the water run    no, i never let the water run.   oh, it sure is fun.   oh, i'm brushing my teeth on the bottom    'cause i wouldn't want to say that i forgot 'em.   all:  but while i'm brushing my teeth and having so much fun    i never let the water run    no, i never let the water run.   barney: good job, everyone.  that's the idea.   oh, i'm brushing my teeth in back    got to get rid of all the plaque.   all:  but while i'm brushing my teeth and having so much fun    i never let the water run    no, i never let the water run.    i never let the water run    no, i never let the water run.   barney: they're feeling cleaner.   oh, i'm brushing my teeth all around    'cause i like to hear the swishing sound.    all:  but while i'm brushing my teeth and having so much fun    i never let the water run    no, i never let the water run.   barney: oh, i think they're clean now.   oh, great job.  kids: that was so fun, yeah.  okay, i'm ready for my closeup now.  good.  i've got the camera.  will you be in the picture with me.  both: of course, barney.  great.  okay, here we go.  one, two, threesay "cheese," please.  all: cheese, please.  that'll be a great picture.  laura: barney, when i was brushing my teeth, this tooth was wiggling.  oh, well, you've got a loose tooth.  it'll be okay, laura.  a loose tooth is nothing to worry about.  really, barney.  no, it's a baby tooth.  all of your baby teeth will get loose and then fall out...  but just one at a time.  yeah, i already lost some of my baby teeth.  me, too.  but i still have some left.  after each baby tooth falls out, a bigger tooth will grow in its place until you have a whole set of brandnew grownup teeth.  that's what my dentist told me, barney.  a dentist is a doctor for your mouth and teeth.  a dentist knows all about how to take care of them.  he uses a camera, too, jackson.  he does.  uhhuh.  he has a special camera that can take a picture inside your mouth to see if the teeth are growing into the right place.  that kind of picture is called an x ray.  cooli wish i had a camera like that.  i'm so glad to know it's okay to have a wiggly tooth, barney.  and i'm glad to see you smiling again, laura.  if you have any other questions about your teeth, you can always ask the...  kids: dentist.  barney: oh, that's right.  have you ever been to a dentist.  let's see what it's like to visit a real dentist office.  it's important to take care of your teeth, and one way to do it is by visiting the dentist.  when you go for your appointment, you say "hello" to the person at the front desk who will tell the dentist you're here.  then you wait in the waiting room, where you can read stories or play with toys until they call your name.  the dentist's assistant covers your clothes to keep them tidy and you get to sit in a special chair that leans way back.  she cleans your teeth with a special kind of toothbrush, and it tickles.   next, she'll use dental floss to clean between your teeth.  now the dentist is ready to look at your teeth.  the bright light above the chair helps him see into your mouth.  sometimes, he uses a special little mirror to look around inside your mouth.  if everything looks okay, you're all done.  and when it's time to go, you may get a nice new toothbrush and even a hug.  oh, wow.  the dentist office is a neat place to visit.  sometimes it's fun to play dentist.  one of our friends is pretending to be a dentist right now.  her favorite color is yellow.  can you guess who it is.  let's go see.  miss bunny, it's your turn now.  okay, open up, let me have a lookee.  hi, baby bop.
