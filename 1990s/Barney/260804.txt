  and sing with happy faces    barney shows us lots of things    like how to play pretend    abcs and one, two, threes    and how to be a friend .   barney comes to play with us    whenever we may need him    barney can be your friend, too    if you just makebelieve him.   whoa.  all: barney.  oh, hello, everybody.   do it again. whoa.   come on, lindsay, hurry up, let's go.  oh, i can't do

good.  hi there.  hi, baby bop.  hi. hi, becky, hi, lindsay.  that looks like fun.   ooh. that's so pretty, riff.  oh, thanks.  they're called scales, boppity bop.  you hear the different sounds.

it.  :  do re mi lo di do    fa so lo.   well, that didn't sound very pretty at all.   it takes some practice.  you'll be better when you're older.  that was fun.  sure was.  that was some teerrific skating.  oh, i want to skate.  i don't think our skates would fit you.  maybe when you're bigger.  oh, i'm too little for this and too little for that.  what can i do.  well, i know something we can try.  can you help us with a clapping song, riff.  sure.  oh, great.  what are we going to do.   this is a song and a clapping game    it's so much fun to play    you can do it with a group, you can do it by yourself    you can do it most every day, just listen now    have you got it.   it's kind of hard.  okay, baby bop, give it a try.  okay.   now it's going to be your turn to try the clapping part    you can do it real loud, you can do it real soft    but get ready, 'cause we're going to start    here we go now .  barney: once more now.  don't worry, you'll get it.  okay.   the good thing about this clapping    is that the rhythm will never, never change    but the things we're going to clap on    may seem a little strange.   on your stomach now.  whoa.  on your shoulders.  oh, there's one shoulder.  where's my other one.  uh...  well, keep trying, baby bop.  okay.   the good thing about this clapping    is that the rhythm will never, never change    but the things we're going to clap on    may seem a little strange   on your knees w.  barney: oh.  on your hips now.  okay, let's try it one more time.  oh, yeah, give it another shot.   here is the end of the clapping game    it's sung in many lands    just to make us feel good on the very last time    everybody clap with your hands   here we go now.  okay, got that part.  wait, i missed that.  last time now.  oh.  oh. oh.  yeah. yeah. oh.  there's one more thing i can't do.  don't worry, baby bop.  we'll find something you can do.  hey, look. let's play with the hoops.  okay.  oh, yeah.  oh, i want to do that.  i know i'm not too little for this.  watch.  and... whoo.  oh.  this is easy. here, watch.  oh, this is not easy.  what's wrong with this thing.  it just takes some practice, baby bop.  it'll be easier when you're bigger.  yeah, you'll do it someday, boppity bop.  but i want to do it now.  i don't want to wait till someday.  that someday will be here soon, baby bop, because you're growing every day.   growing, we do it every day    we're growing when we're sleeping    and even when we play    and as we grow a little older, we can do more things    because we're growing and so are you   oh.   each day, we grow a little taller    a little bigger, not smaller    and we grow a little friendlier, too    we try to be a little nicer as we grow each day    because we're growing and so are you   whoa.  it's true, baby bop.  i think i feel myself growing right now.   growing, we do it every day    we're growing when we're sleeping    and even when we play    and as we grow a little older, we can do more things    because we're growing and so are you    each day, we grow a little taller    a little bigger, not smaller    and we grow a little friendlier, too    we try to be a little nicer as we grow each day    because we're growing and so are you    because we're growing and so are you.    yahoo.   am i really growing, barney.  yes, you are.  you can do new things with each new day.  then,

can do, and all by yourself.  really.   you can do it, there's nothing to it    you can do it by yourself    had to ask for help when you were small    but now you're bigger, you can do it all    you're feeling proud, as we can tell    'cause you can do it by yourself   tie your shoes.   you can do it, you can do it   barney: by yourself.   you can do it, you can do it   brush your teeth.

things we do.    have you ever noticed    you are my very best friend    and how everyone wants to be a little more like you.    but if everybody was the same    i couldn't just be me    so i'll just have to find a way, it's true    to be what i am, who i am    all that i can be    that's the best way i can think of    to be me   it doesn't matter if you can't jump rope, barney.  or swing or ride
