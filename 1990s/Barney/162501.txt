we go.  barney... hmm.  i'm still not sure about sleeping out here.  what if i get scared.  sleeping here won't be too different from sleeping at home.  come on and you'll see.  you see.  getting ready for bed on a campout is a lot like getting ready for bed at home.  yeah. we can't forget to brush our teeth.  that's right. you're right.  well, that's no problem.  wow.  cool. all right. oh, boy.   check it out.  everybody, get one. thank you, bj.   oh, i'm brushing my teeth on top    it's so much fun, i hate to stop    but while i'm brushing my teeth and having so much fun    i never let the water run, no    i never let the water run    oh, i'm brushing my teeth on the bottom    'cause i wouldn't want to say that i forgot 'em    but while i'm brushing my teeth and having so much fun    i never let the water run    no, i never let the water run    oh, i'm brushing my teeth in back    got to get rid of all the plaque    but while i'm brushing my teeth and having so much fun    i never let the water run, no    i never let the water run     i never let the water run, no    i never let the water run   sure don't.  oh, yeah.  take it away, beej.   oh, i'm brushing my teeth all around    'cause i like to hear the swishing sound    but while i'm brushing my teeth and having so much fun    i never let the water run, no    i never let the water run.   oh, boy.  whoa.   nice and clean.  yeah, that feels great.  is it time to go to sleep now, barney.  no.  i mean, no, not yet.  how about we tell stories.  oh, yeah. good idea, melanie.  now then, once upon a time, there was a beautiful princess who lived in a big castle, full of rooms and many servants.  the children, they ate all day long.  and this princess owned her own giant elephant.  and his name was sir reginald.   and she loved peanut butter, and she ate it all day long with all of her good friends.  guys.  barney, i'm the only one that's still awake.  well, it is way past their regular bedtime.   what was that.  don't worry, that's the sound of an owl.  owls live outside and they're awake at night.  they can see in the dark much better than we can.   do you know what that sound is.  is it a frog.  that's right.  the frog in the pond is out looking for his supper.   what was that..  barney: um, that was the sound of bj snoring.  you know, barney, all these sounds aren't so scary once you know what they are.  that's true, melanie.   oh, i used to be afraid    but not anymore    owls used to scare me    but that was before    barney taught me that the things that used to bother me    really aren't so scary at all    no, they're not so scary at all   that's right.    oh, i used to be afraid, but not anymore     frogs used to scare me    but that was before    barney taught me that the things that used to bother me    really aren't so scary at all   oh, no.   no, they're not so scary at all   there you go, melanie.    oh, i used to be afraid    but not anymore    being outside at night used to scare me    but that was before    barney taught me that the things that used to bother me    really aren't so scary at all    no, they're not so scary at all    no, they're not so scary at all.    see, told you.   you know, barney, you were right.  sleeping out here is going to be like sleeping at home, only outside.  uhhuh.  instead of a roof over your head, there's a sky full of stars.   oh, wowwee. what was that..  it's okay.  it's just a frog out looking for his supper.  oh. i see.  oh, man, now i'm never going to get back to sleep.  well, usually when i'm having trouble sleeping, my mom sings me a bedtime song.  barney, could you sing one for us.  yeah, would you, barney. please, barney.  i'd be happy to.   now it's time, snuggle up, little one    hold me tight, snuggle up, day is done    it's bedtime with barney all over the world    bedtime with barney for all boys and girls   that's right.   i'm a little sleepy.   now it's time, snuggle up, little one    let me sing just for you, you're the one    it's bedtime with barney anear and afar    bedtime with barney    let's wish on a star.     oh, barney, i like that lullaby.  yeah, barney, it was great.  yeah, barney, it was great.  i think now everyone can get to sleep, including me.  and the sooner we get to sleep, the sooner we'll be able to wake up and share another day with the friends we love.    i love you, you love me    we're a happy family    with a great big hug and a kiss from me to you    won't you say you love me, too.    i love you, you love me    we're best friends like friends
