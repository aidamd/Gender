 he taught us how to grow all these fruits and vegetables.  we've been working so well together.  oh, well, that's nice.  first we dig up the ground to make a nice soft bed.  oh, now i like a nice soft bed.  and then we put the seeds in the ground and cover them with a blanket of soil.  barney, what's a blanky of soil.  that just means putting more dirt on top of the little seed.  and then when you add some water and sunshine, they begin to grow and grow all: whoa.  ...and grow.  soon, we'll all have all sorts of delicious fruit and beautiful vegetables.  and then comes the best part.  we get to eat them.  yeah, we're going to have a party with all the food we've grown.  oh, now, i like parties.  would you like to help us water the garden before the party.  um, nope.  i want to go play.  come on. let's go swing and slide.  we'll play with you, baby bop, right after we're finished.  but i want to play now.  oh, oh, i know what to do.  hey, everybody, would you like to sing and

a frog in the water     listen to a mommy talking to her daughter   come on, claire, let's go.   listen to the animals playing in the woods    and listen to the sounds of our neighborhood    and listen to the sounds of our neighborhood    listen with your left ear and your right    listen to the sounds of the day and night       we listen with our ears, that's right    that's right.    if we
