needle    that's the way the money goes    "pop" goes the weasel.   w that was f un.  xq   w barney: oh, boy.   the painter needs a ladder and brush    the artist needs an easel    the dancers need a fiddler's tune    "pop" goes the weasel.    i've no time to wait and sigh    or to tell the reason why    kiss me quick, i'm off, goodbye    "pop" goes the weasel.   good job.  k all:  "pop" goes the weasel.   k. e gw  that was a good game.   what's that noise.  it's coming from the caboose.  whitney: i think it's a fire alarm.  nick: uhoh, there might be a fire.  what should we do, barney.  we better wait outside until we know everything is okay in the caboose.  oh, it's okay.  there's no fire.  you can go back in.  hello, barney.  i was just testing the fire alarm and i'm finished now.  hi, fire fighter bill.  i'd like you to meet my friends, stacy... hi.  david... hi.  whitney...  hello.  and nick. hi.  kids, this is fire fighter bill.  hello, everyone.  wow, are you a real fire fighter.  do you ride a fire truck.  with a siren.  yes, i do.  what a cool job.  but it's only part of my job.  i also do safety inspections.  that's why i came hereto check the fire alarm in the caboose.  i need to make sure it works in case there's ever a fire.  fire fighter bill also teaches about fire safety.  would you guys like to take my fire safety test.  kids: yeah.  okay, who knows what this is.  nick: that's a smoke detector.  we have those in my house.  that's good, nick.  very good.  do you know what a smoke detector does.  if there's smoke in your house, it goes "beep, beep, beep." that's right.  now, here's what this smoke detector sounds like.   wow. that's really loud. ow.  yeah.  now, what should you do if you hear that sound.  you should go outside right away.  and wait in a safe place.  right.  but remember, if you see smoke, you need to stay low to the floor as you go.  we say, "stay low and go." like this.  yes, just like that.  come on, everybody, stay low and go.  barney: you can do it.  fire fighter bill: very good.  well, fire fighter bill, have they passed your test.  they sure have, barney, and these stickers show that all of you know how to stay safe around fire.  barney: good job.  wow.  thank you.  you're welcome.  well, it was good to meet all of you, but i have to go do another safety inspection now.  goodbye, everyone, and stay safe.  goodbye. thanks. we will.  that was awesome.  yeah.  let's pretend we're doing safety inspections, too.  that sounds like fun.  okaywe can make our own checklists.  all right, come on, let's go.   you know, learning about safety is something you can do, too.  good safety habits can help you stay safe when you eat, play, or take a bath.  let's go see how baby bop gives her teddy a safe bath.   would you like to take a bath, teddy.  : yes, please.  will you help me.  oh, okay.  oh, hello, baby bop.  is it bath time.  yes, barney.  i'm going to give teddy a nice bath.  but would you check the water for me, please.  good thinking, baby bop.  i'd be happy to check it for you.  we don't want it to be too hot for your teddy.  not too hot, not too cold, it's just right.  goody.  okay, teddy, in you go.  okay.  oh, look, barney, teddy's splashing in the water.  oh, look at that.  oh, be careful, teddy, don't get soap in your eyes.  you're doing such a good job, baby bop.  i think teddy likes her bath.  teddy's having so much fun.  i want to have fun taking a bath, too.    baby bop:  sometimes i splash too much    i hope i won't get in trouble    but when i take a bath, it's so much fun    watching bubble after bubble after bubble.    all:  oh, when you're splashin' around    it is fun to pretend    you're a fish or a froggy or a duck    quack. quack.    but don't forget    to wash your arms and legs    and your tummy and your back.   oh.  oh, i just love bath time.  i know.  and splashing.  baby bop:  sometimes i splash too much    i hope i won't get in trouble    but when i take a bath, it's so much fun    watching bubble after bubble after bubble.    all:  oh, when you're splashin' around    it is fun to pretend    you're a fish or a froggy or a duck    quack. quack.    but don't forget    to wash your arms and legs    and your tummy and your back    but don't forget    to wash your arms and legs    and your tummy and your back.   baby bop:  and my tummy and my back.    look at the bubbles.   splishysplashy.   it's important to be careful in the bath, and it's important at other times, too.  how about when you're riding in a car.  do you know what this is.  it's a car seat.  i'm sure lots of you ride in one every day.  and we always buckle up our seat belt when we ride in a car, right.  that's very important.  but that's not the only place you can buckle up.   all:  drivin' to my school, i buckle my belt    drivin' to my school, i buckle my belt    drivin' to my school, i buckle my belt    buckle up my seat belt.        sittin' in my chair, i buckle my belt    sittin' in my chair, i buckle my belt    sittin' in my chair, i buckle my belt    buckle up my seat belt.        goin' for a ride, i buckle my belt    goin' for a ride, i buckle my belt    goin' for a ride, i buckle my belt    buckle up my seat belt.        drivin' everywhere, i buckle my belt    drivin' everywhere, i buckle my belt    drivin' everywhere, i buckle my belt    buckle up my seat belt.        okay, inspector whitney, are you ready to do our safety inspection in the kitchen.  uhhuh. what should we do first, inspector nick.  let's see if there are any sharp knives.  only grownups should use real knives.  these are toy knives.  they're okay for us to use.  "toy... knives." that's good.   oh, hello, everyone.  how's the safety inspection going.  it's going great, barney.  barney, come see my firstaid kit.  okay, stacy.  what have you got there.  bandages, some firstaid cream, gloves like a doctor wears, cotton balls and scissors.  i think my firstaid kit is ready.  oh, good.  you never know when you might need a firstaid kit.  hi. hi, everybody.  hi, there, baby bop.  what are you doing.  i'm playing catch.  i throw the ball and then i try to catch it.  watch, here i go.  whee....  oh, oh... oops.  be careful, baby bop, you might break something.  ooh, i'm sorry.  i didn't mean to.  we know, baby bop, but it's not a good idea to play with your ball inside because it can easily break something when it bounces around.  it's best to play with your ball outdoors.  oh, okay.  yeah.  we're pretending to be safety inspectors, so we don't want any accidents in here.  well, what's a safety inspector.  it's a person who checks to make sure things are safe.  that sounds like fun.  can i play.  sure.  you can help us check the kitchen.  oh, goody, i like to help in the kitchen.  i'll pretend i'm cooking on the stove.  and that's a toy stove, so you can play with it, but you need to be very careful around a real stove.  i do.  yeah.  real stoves can get hot.  it's really hot on the top part, so never touch it here.  this is the oven.  it gets hot in here, too.  even the pots and pans we cook with can get very hot.  that's why we wear theseso our hands won't get burned.  okay.  if i'm really careful, can we pretend to cook something on the stove.  oh, sure.  what would you like to cook.  hmm, let oh, i know.  let's make some mishmash soup.  kids: yeah.  barney: great idea.  mishmash soup sounds so good.  oh, yum.   barney:  i was standing in the kitchen    talking to my friends    and we decided to make a special soup    it would be real different, 'cause it would have    something from each food group.   all:  and we're gonna call it mishmash soup    and we don't know how it's gonna taste.     it's gonna look a little weird and seem a little strange    but we won't let it go to waste    so, in goes some bread...    and then a little milk...    now, don't forget some fish...    and the fruits and veggies that we put in next...    will make it a very special dish.   all:  and we're gonna call it mishmash soup    and we don't know how it's gonna taste    it's gonna look a little weird and seem a little strange    but we won't let it go to waste.        now we've mixed in all the foods    one from every group    it's gonna fix your hunger or your thirst    but i'm getting kind of scared, 'cause i'm the one    who's gonna have to taste it first.   all:  and so we're calling it mishmash soup    and we don't know how it's gonna taste...    there you go.  all:  it looks a little weird and seems a little strange    but we won't let it go to waste.    oh, try your soup, baby bop, but first, blow on it so it's not too hot.  okay.     well, i took a little taste, and to my surprise    it didn't really taste that bad    in fact, the more i ate, the more i knew    it was the best soup i ever had.   all:  and so we're calling it mishmash soup    and we know just how it's gonna taste    it looks a little weird and seems a little strange    and we didn't let it go to waste    yeah, we didn't let it go to waste.    oh, that was fun.  i like that soup.  oh, me, toothat was good.  now we can clear the table.  and wash the dishes.  can i help, too, please.  sure, you can help me pick up the dishes.  i'll put the water in the sink.  be sure it's not too hot.  i'll be careful.   it's nice when everyone works together.  do you like to help out in your house.  can you show me what you do to help.  mommy, can i please set the table.  sure you can.  kids:  i'm a happy helper    show me what to do    i'm a happy helper    i like helping you    yes, i'm a happy helper...        giving help is so much fun and isn't hard to do    remember just how good it feels    when friends are helping you    i'm a happy helper    show me what to do    i'm a happy helper    i like helping you    yes, i'm a happy helper...       a  you can show you care with all the helpful things you do    helping others is a way of saying "i love you"    i'm a happy helper    show me what to do    i'm a happy helper    i like helping you    yes, i'm a happy helper.        have you ever seen one of these.  this is a stop sign.  see. the letters stop make the word "stop." and "stop" means this:..  and then i stop.  can you try it with me.  let's walk...  and now we stop.  oh, superdeeduper.  knowing what to do when you see a stop sign can help you cross the street safely.  hey, barney.  oh, hey, b.j.    oh, um, are you okay.  didn't you see the stop sign.  oh... sorry, barney.  i guess i should be more careful.  i'm always careful when i cross the street.  you need to practice, b.j.  well, that's a good idea, baby bop.  come on, let's all practice crossing the street.    oh, when i walk...    across the street...    oh, when i walk across the street    i always cross at the corner    when i walk across the street.   oh, let's try it, b.j.  all right.  oh, that's it.   oh, when i walk...   chorus: oh, when i walk...   across the street...   across the street...  all:  oh, when i walk across the street    i always stop, look and listen    when i walk across the street.   oh.  barney:  oh, when i walk...   oh, when i walk...   across the street...   across the street...  all:  oh, when i

some more.  sure.  let's see, the next thing on my list is a bedroom.  but the caboose doesn't have a bedroom.  yeah.  well, inspecting a bedroom is a good idea.  so, how about this one.   baby bop: wow. a bed.  : sure is.  okay, inspectors, how do we stay safe in a bedroom.  no jumping on the bed.  that's good.  and we should pick up the toys so we don't trip on them.  barney: that's t he right

good job of being careful, baby bop.  well, thank you, barney.  b.j., let's go do a safety check in your room.  i want to make sure that my big brother is always sa.  okay, sissy.  and then we'll

and wellbeing of all children.  in this episode, barney and his friends practice being safe in different situations.  baby bop knows how to be careful when she takes a bath.  pretending to cook on a toy stove is a good time to talk about the dangers of being near a real stove.  fire fighter bill reminds us how important it is to make sure our smoke detectors are working.  and when there's smoke in a room, stay low and crawl to a safe exit.  make sure your child is always buckled up in a car or stroller.  wanting your child to be saf is another way of showing you care, and it's never too early to talk to your child about the importance of safety.  to learn moreaboutbarney & friends...   something do.  hop.  make a silly face.   cartwheel.  what can you do.  know.  when you cross the
