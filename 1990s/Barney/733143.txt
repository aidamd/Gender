this.  this is a grass skirt.  yes, it is.  oh.  just like the hula dancers wear in hawaii.  you look great, baby bop.  oh, thank you.   oh, it feels kind of itchy, though.  well, that's because it's

a movie, and everyone who came to see it could bring food.  and david wanted her to make an adventure movie, baby bop wanted it to have lots of dancing, and riff wanted to make the music for it.  but things didn't work out the way they planned.  so melanie decided to make her movie a funny movie.  everyone brought food for grace's food drive, and they all had a teerrific time.  and remember, i love you.    time for barney's music box.         the itsybitsy spider went up the water spout    down came the rain )
