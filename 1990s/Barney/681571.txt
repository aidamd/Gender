"but soon the old man said, 'now i'm too cold.  ' "so the magician decided to grant his wish.  "he turned the old man into the sun, "but now he was too hot, and he said, "'oh, i wish i was the moon.  "i imagine it isn't too hot ' "at last, the man was very happy.  "he's still there today.  "and we call him the man in the moon.  " awesome.  yay.  that was a great story, barney.  the man in the moon may be makebelieve, but we can all pretend to see him with a little imagination.   just imagine    just imagine     just imagine all the things that we could be    imagine all the places we could go and see    imagination's fun for you and me   wheeee.    we could go to the moon in a great big balloon     build a castle by playing pretend    we might even explore    with a big dinosaur    or make rainbows that never end   whoo.     just imagine    just imagine    just imagine all the things that we    could be    imagine all the places we could go    and see    imagination's fun for you and me     imagination's fun for you and me       i've seen the man in the moon lots of times.  yeah, he has a nice friendly face.  have you ever seen him, baby bop.  oh, yes, all the time.  i talk to the man in the moon almost every night.  what do you say to him.  oh, lots of things.  i tell him what i had for lunch.  i

made out of cheese.  no, silly.   it's made of macaroni and cheese.  oh.  i'm gonna go say good night to the man in the moon.  i'll be right back.  okay.  okay, bye.  see you soon.  oh, mr. man in the moon.  where are you.  oh. oh, there you are.   oh, no.  what happened.  there's only part of it.  wherewhere's the rest of the moon.  oh, it must have broken, and it must have fallen from the sky.  where could it be.  it has to be around here somewhere.  oh, dear.  oh, i have to look really hard and see if i canoh.  well, there it is.  oh, i found the rest of it.  oh, poor moon.  it fell in the water.  ohhh.  i better do something.  what, what, what.  i have to think of something.  oh, well, maybe i can use this to get it.  moon, i'm coming in.  i'll get you out of there.  oh, yay.  i think i got it.  i think ii thinkiii don't have it.  ooh, itit's still in there.  and it's all wiggly.  oh, well, that didn't work.   what should i do.           what should i do    when i don't know    ohhhh    should i make    should i cross my arms    oooooh    should i count    when i haven't got a clue,      what should i do    when i don't know      should i shout   oh, no.   should i ring my mom    i'm feeling so confused        what should i do    when i don't know        what should i do    when i don't know   ohh.  ohhh.  what's the matter, baby bop.  well, the moon is the matter.  oh, what do you mean.  well, it broke, and part of it fell in the water.  i've been trying to get it out, but i can't.  what should i do.  oh, baby bop.  the moon didn't fall into the pond.  but there it is, right there.  well, that's not really it.  the water's like a mirror, and you're seeing the moon's reflection in it.  really.  uhhuh.  the moon is still in the sky.  we just can't see all of it all of the time.  oh, i see.  the rest of the moon is not in the water.  that's right.  so that means it's somewhere else.  the moon is broken, and the man in the moon has no place to live.  oh. oh, i know.  i know.  he can stay with me until it's fixed.  but it'swellwhere are you going.  oh, i'm going to get jackie and marcos to help me.  oh, got to run.  okay.  oh, my.   what's this for, baby

well, i don't think i could jump to the moon, baby bop.  oh, barney, please.  well, all right.  i'll try.  let's see here.  all right, up.  whoa. whoa.  whoa.  up. oh.  okay, one more time.  up. whoa.  oh, i'm afraid i can't make it, baby bop.  ohh.  oh, oh, i know what to do.  what, baby bop.  i'll call him on the telephone and ask him to come stay with me.  oh, well, that won't work.  i don't even know his phone number.  i'll have to think of something else to do.  let's see.  she still thinks the moon's broken.  oh, i know what to do.  what's that.  we'll get a rocket ship.  a rocket ship.  yes, and we'll fly right up there and help the man in the moon.  i don't think we could do that, baby bop.  can we, barney.  well, we can if we use our imaginations.  whoa.   wow. look.  come

pretty.  hey, who's that.  oh, i believe it's the man in the moon.  hello, barney.  welcome, friends.   hi, mr. man in the moon.   hello.  man in the moon, i'm so glad you're okay.  hello there, baby bop.  i'm just fine.  well, i was so worried when i saw the moon was broken.  oh, but it's not.  it's okay.  well, it looked broken when i was in the park.  it's all here.  you just couldn't see it from where you were because of a shadow.  oh, you mean like it was playing hideandseek.  that's right.  but don't you worry, baby bop.  even if you can't see me, i'll always be up here shining down on you.  oh, goody.  i'm glad you're okay, mr. man in the moon.  thank you, baby bop.  it's nice to have a friend who cares.  and remember, the next time you look up in the night sky, the moon may look different to you.  some nights you'll see a big and round moon.  that's called a full moon.  and sometimes you'll only see part of a moon.  that's called a halfmoon.  some nights you only see a sliver.  and that's called a crescent moon.  and when you look at it sideways, it sort of looks like a smile.   whoa, it really does.  but no matter what shape you see, i'll always be up here.  oh, that makes me feel so happy.    wherever i go    i always know    you'll be shining on me   ding.   yes you're a big bright light    that shines in the night    for the whole wide world to see    moon, shine bright    light up the night    until you have to fade away    when we start a new day    you're such a beautiful sight    so keep on shining moon    after i go to sleep   moon is still smiling at me    and even though his shape might change    he'll always remain the same friend for all to see    moon, shine bright    light up the night    until you have to fade away    when we start a new day    you're such a beautiful sight    so keep on shining moon    you're such a beautiful sight    so keep on shining moon    yes, you're a beautiful sight    so keep on shining moon

our fun and learning never end.  here's what we did today.  we joined our friends for a fun time reading books.  after we read a story about the man in the moon, baby bop went outside to say hello to him.  but when she saw only half a moon, she thought it had broken.  we took a trip in a rocket ship to make sure everything was all right and met the man in the moon himself.   what an adventure that was.  baby bop was happy to know that the man in the moon was just fine and he would always be there, watching over her.  and remember, i love you.  here are some sounds i can make.           i can make a funny noise.  bllaaahh.     i can make the sound of thunder.   what sounds can you make.     time for barney's music box.      hickory dickory dock    the mouse ran up the clock   00    the
