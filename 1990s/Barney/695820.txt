  . barney is a dinosaur from our imagination .  . and when he's tall, he's what we call a dinosaur sensation. .  . barney's friends are big and small .  . they come from lots of places .  . after school, they meet to play .  . and sing with happy faces. .  . barney shows us lots of things .  . like how to play pretend .  . abcs and 123s and how to be a friend.  .  . barney comes to play with us whenever we may need him .  . barney can be your friend, too .  . if you just makebelieve him. .  kids: barney.  oh, hi, there.  oh, it's great to see you again.  are you ready to have some fun.   that's good, because today, we're going to do lots of things with this.  : it's a key, but do you know what kind of key.  try to guess by watching and listening.  open the door here.  step right in.  close that.  now i'll put my seat belt on.  click.  adjust the mirror there.  oh, i can see now.  oh, and last but not least...   there. whoa.   so, did you guess what kind of key this is.  oh, it's a car key.  so let's join our friends and have some fun with cars.  come on.   let's go to the library.  okay, then let's go to the ice cream shop.  it's a very nice day for a drive, laura.  it certainly is, david.  and look, we're just arriving at the park.  let's stop awhile and visit our friends.  friends like me.  laura: uhhuh.  : and like me.  kids: barney.  oh, hi, everyone.  it's good to see you.  that looked like a fun game you were playing.  we were pretending to drive a car, like grownups do.  it's my turn next to drive.   only, i don't think there's room up there for all four of us.  well, then maybe your game needs a car that's big enough to share...  like this.   kids: wow. check it out.   look at the car.  how about a makebelieve drive.  all aboard.  kids: yay.  oh, fasten your seat belts, and here we go.    . i love to ride in barney's car .  . i look around at where we are .  . and all the license plates i see help me learn my abcs... .  all: . riding in the car, riding in the car .  . we love riding in the car. .  . i love to ride in mommy's van .  . i sit in back whenever i can .  . i look for friends from my school class .  . and wave at drivers as they pass. .  all: . riding in the car, riding in the car .  . we love riding in the car. .  . i love to ride in grandpa's car .  . he never knows just where we are .  . since he won't stop to check a map .  . i see new places in a snap. .  all: . riding in the car, riding in the car .  . we love riding in the car. .  kids: . we love to ride in barney's car .  . round the corner or to the stars... .  . he starts us up... .  . our seat belts buckle... .  . he makes us laugh... .  . you make me chuckle. .  all: . riding in the car, riding in the car .  . we love riding in the car .  . riding in the car, riding in the car .  . we love riding in the car. .   let me just turn this off here.  i'll bet it's fun to drive a real car.   oh, it can be, but it's more than just fun.  drivers also need to be very careful, so they use their eyes and ears to know what's around them.  can we please try doing that.  oh, please, can we.  yeah. okay.  let's all listen and guess what we're hearing.    that sounds like kids.  oh, right.    that's easy.  that's a dog.  i hope it's on a leash so it won't run into the street.   well, who knows what that sound is.  it's a bella bicycle bell.  : i think you're right.   hmm.  um, barney, what's that sound.  well, it sounds like some kind of siren.  look.  oh, it's b.j..   . here comes the fire truckthe people shout... .  all: . hooray. .  . the siren tells the cars and trucks .  . to get out of the way. .  . look at all the flashing lights .  . and watch the water spray .  . hey. fire truck. .  b.j.: that spells "fire truck." barney: . i love the fire truck with all its hoses and ladders... .  kids: . and fire fighters off to save the day .  . hooray. .  i love to watch them ride as they hang onto the side... .  . of the fire truck. .  all: that spells "fire truck." . here comes the fire truck .  . the people shout "hooray." .  barney: . the siren tells the cars and trucks .  . to get out of the way. .  . look at all the flashing lights... .  . and watch the water spray. .  . hey. .  .  .  . here comes the fire truck .  . hooray. hooray. hooray. .   hey, b.j..   b.j., check out the car we've been pretending to drive.  all right.   oh, it's a beauty.    it still has that new car smell.   and how about my scooter's new fire engine light and siren.  cool, huh.  cool. yeah.  oh, very cool.  a fire engine's lights and sirens tell cars to move out of the way, so the fire fighters can hurry to help people.  yeah.  come on, guys.  let's pretend we're hurrying to help some people right now.  kids: okay. yeah.  okay.  oh, there are lots of different ways to help people and you can be a helper right now.  try doing this.  come on, lift your hand and move it in circles like this.  kids: . i'm a happy helper .  . show me what to do .  . i'm a happy helper .  . i like helping you .  . yes, i'm a happy helper... .  . . .  kids and barney: . giving help is so much fun and isn't hard to do .  . remember just how good it feels .  . when friends are helping you .  . i'm a happy helper .  . show me what to do .  . i'm a happy helper .  . i like helping you .  . yes, i'm a happy helper. .  . . .  . you can show you care with all the helpful things you do .  . helping others is a way of saying "i love you" .  . i'm a happy helper .  . show me what to do .  . i'm a happy helper .  . i like helping you .  . yes, i'm a happy helper. .  . . .   oh, there you are.  check it out.  i was just playing with my car.  i use this to make it start...   and stop.  go forward...  or backward...  or make it turn in a circle, like this.   oh, i can make this car do whatever i want it to, yep, and... wwhoa.  look out.  whoa. hold on.  not that way.   oh, i guess i still need to practice my driving some more.  all right.  hi, guys.  this is going to be great.   b.j. and kids: . buckle up your seat belt .  . we're gonna do this right .  . we're gonna drive this car around the track .  . now, everybody, please hold on tight .  . we're riding in a race car... .   . don't you know the fun just grows and grows .  . we're riding in a race car .  . around and round we go. .  come on.  b.j. and kids: . we can go kind of fast .  . or we can go real slow .  . come on, everybody, it's time to get movin' .  . aone, two, three, let's go .  . we're riding in a race car... .   . don't you know the fun just grows and grows .  . we're riding in a race car .  . around and round we go... .  . . .  . just drivin' around with a great big smile on your face .  . come on, get ready because it's time to race .  b.j.: oh...  b.j. and kids: . we're riding in a race car .  . don't you know the fun just grows and grows .  . we're riding in a race car .  . around and round we go... .   b.j. and kids: . we're riding in a race car .  . around and round we go. .   : wow.  did you see those cars going round and round the track.  they're called "gokarts," and big kids drive them on a special track to stay safe, not out in the streets.  and for smaller kids, there are cars like this to play with...  whoa.   oh, and i know someone who'd like to play with it right now.   b.j.: look out.  what is it. whoa, whoa.  i got a little bump from a little car, see.   yeah.  it's a good thing it wasn't abigcar, or it would have been a really big bump.  huh.  boom.  whoa. whoa. oh.   and speaking of big bumps...   sorry, barney.  well, that's okay, b.j.  besides, you were telling baby bop something very important.  he was.  yeah, i was.  uh... what was it.  well, that accidents can happen, even when you're riding in a big car, so it's important to always use a safety seat or seat belt.  safety seats are for kids who are little, like me.  but i'm big enough to buckle my own seat belt, and i do it every single time.  well, that's great.  safety seats and seat belts are like a special hug that holds you tight to keep you safe.  let's all practice buckling our seat belts.  okay. yeah.  all: . drivin' to my school, i buckle my belt .  . drivin' to my school, i buckle my belt .  . drivin' to my school, i buckle my belt .  . buckle up my seat belt. .  : oh, come on.  i want you to pretend to buckle your seat belt, too.  it's very, very important.  pull it across, then click it in place.  oh.  all: . drivin' to my house, i buckle my belt .  . drivin' to my house, i buckle my belt .  . drivin' to my house, i buckle my belt .  . buckle up my seat belt. .  b.j.: let's drive to grandma's.  all: . drivin' to grandma's, i buckle my belt .  . drivin' to grandma's, i buckle my belt .  . drivin' to grandma's, i buckle my belt .  . buckle up my seat belt. .  that's the idea.   all: . drivin' everywhere, i buckle my belt .  . drivin' everywhere, i buckle my belt .  . drivin' everywhere, i buckle my belt .  . buckle up my seat belt. .  oh, we did it. yeah.   that was fun.   hey, barney.   b.j., is this your race car.  yeah.  where'd you find it.  it foundus.  it zoomed over the bridge, zipped up the slide and then landed in a pile of leaves.  : cool.  uh, i mean... oops.   um... my car doesn't look like your car, b.j.   barney: that's because cars come in lots of different colors and shapes.  here, i'll show you.  kids: okay.  go to the computer and...  let's see.  user name: barney.  password: dinosaur.  b.j.: i could have guessed that.  search on "cars".  ah, here we are.   baby bop: whoa.  barney: most cars have four wheels, windows to see through, seats for people and a steering wheel for the driver.  but different cars do different things.  race cars go very fast.   some families have big cars or vans to carry lots of people.  oh, and other cars are small and cute.  kids: that's tiny.   i've never seen a car like that before.  barney: well, that's what the very first car looked like.  oh, it was called a "horseless carriage" because before cars, people used carriageswithhorses.  see.   baby bop: oh, i'd like to ride in that.  me, too. me, too.  yeah, that would be awesome.  everyone would know when you were coming, because the horse would make a clipclop sound.  like this.    b.j.: yeah.  it sounds like someone is coming right now.   barney: . she'll be comin' round the mountain when she comes .  . toot, toot .  . she'll be comin' round the mountain when she comes .  . toot, toot. .  all: . she'll be comin' round the mountain .  . she'll be comin' round the mountain .  . she'll be comin' round the mountain when she comes .  . toot, toot .  . she'll be drivin' six white horses when she comes .  . whoa, back .  . she'll be drivin' six white horses when she comes .

was fun.    hi, guys.  people drive cars to places like the store or to work or even to the library to borrow books.  and this book is one of my favorites, because it's got poems like this one.   "little boy blue, come blow your horn..."  aiyiyi.  wow.  sissy, what are you doing..  i'm helping you read the poem.  i'm doing the part about the horn.   okay, okay, you can help, but just the horn part, okay.  oh, okay.   now, where was i.  oh... oh, yeah.  "little boy blue, come blow your horn..."   "the sheep in the meadow, the cow's in the..."  whoa.  oh, sissy, you're only supposed to do the part about the horn.  but you said "cow," and cows have horns.   it's not the same, sissy.  the horn you're holding goes "honk, honk." cows have horns on their heads and they don't makeanysound.  oh, i thought cows went "moo."   "little boy blue, come blow your horn..."  "the sheep's in the meadow, the cow..."  "the cow's in the corn.  "where is the boy who looks after the sheep.  "he's under the haystack : fast asleep."  wow.   sissy, why did you honk the horn again.  it's time for little boy blue to get up.   aiyiyi.  oh, what's wrong, b.j..  i think it's time for me to take this book back to the library.  see you later, barney.  okay, byebye.  vroom, vroomvroom.  beep, beep.  when i'm big enough to drive, i'll go to the library every day.  you will.  uhhuh, and lots of other places, too.   oh, well, until then, you can pretend to drive places...  : and so can you.   kids and barney: . i'm lookin' round my neighborhood .  . and what do i see. .  . some houses and cars and kids like me .  . i see buildings made of brick .  . others made of wood .  . i see people helping people in my neighborhood.  .  . . .  . there's the school and a tree .  . i can see the post office and the library .  . oh, boy, i'm in luck .  . i can even see a shiny red fire truck.  .  . . .  . oh, i'm lookin' round my neighborhood .  . and what do i see. .  . some houses and cars and kids like me .  . i see people and their pets and it makes me feel good .  . to know that i'm part of my neighborhood.  .  . . .  . there's the school and a tree .  . i can see the post office and the library .  . oh, boy, i'm in luck .  . i can even see a shiny red fire truck.  .  hi, i like your red car.   let's go to the toy store.  then let's go to the candy shop.  it looks like you're all having a good time pretending to drive.  we sure are. yeah.  oh, what a cute car.  barney, can we try some of these buttons and things.  boys and girls shouldn't touch any controls in a car that really drives, but since this is a play car, and you asked me, oh, it's okay.  then... what does this do.  barney: well, those are the headlights.  they help drivers see when it gets dark.  what does this do.   that's definitely the car radio.  baby bop: oh, yeah.   here's something we haven't tried.  what does this do.  oh, well, those are the windshield wipers.  they wipe rain off the window, but i don't think we need them today.  leave them on, please.  i want it to rain.   it doesn't really work that way, sissy.  oh.  why do you want it to rain.  so we can pretend that all the raindrops are something fun.  i think i know what you mean.  . if all the raindrops were lemon drops and gumdrops .  . oh, what a rain that would be .  . standing outside with my mouth open wide...  .  all: . ah, ah, ahah, ah, ahah, ah, ahah .  . if all the raindrops were lemon drops and gumdrops .  . oh, what a rain that would be. .  barney: i hope it rains now, too.   . . .  . if all the snowflakes were candy bars and milkshakes .  . oh, what a snow that would be .  . standing outside with my mouth open wide...  .  all: . ah, ah, ahah, ah, ahah, ah, ahah .  . if all the snowflakes were candy bars and milkshakes .  . oh, what a snow that would be. .  b.j.: i'd want it to rain every day.  barney: me, too.  . . .  all: . if all the raindrops were lemon drops and gumdrops .  . oh, what a rain that would be .  . standing outside with my mouth open wide .  . ah, ah, ahah, ah, ahah, ah, ahah .  . if all the raindrops were lemon drops and gumdrops .  . oh, what a rain that would be. .   thanks for letting us play with your car.  oh, you're welcome.  thanks, barney.  goodbye.  see you later.  and don't forget to buckle your seat belts.    oh, i'm glad we learned some safety rules about cars today, barney.  oh, me, too.  well, i'm glad, too.  after all, we want everyone to be safe, especially the people we love.  yeah.  oh.   barney: . i love you, you love me .  . we're a happy family .  . with a great big hug and a kiss from me to you .  . won't you say you love me, too. .  i do love you, barney.  i love you, barney.  all: . i love you, you love me .  . we're best friends like friends should be .  . with a great big hug and a kiss from me to you .  . won't you say you love me, too. .   i guess i should get on my scooter...  i mean my fire engine, and be getting home, too.  ready, sissy.  this time can i make the siren sound, please, .   sure, sissy, i'll do the light...  there.  and you do the siren sound.  okay.  see you later.  bye, bye.   every parent needs a helping
