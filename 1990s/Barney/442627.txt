right.  okay, everybody.  what kind of cookie do you want: peanut butter, chocolate chip, oatmeal, or walnut.  what kind do you want.  i don't know.  what about you.  i want chocolate chip.  yeah, i'll take chocolate chip too.  i want peanut butter.  i'll have peanut butter.  well, i only have enough flour to make one kind.  i can't make peanut butter and chocolate chip cookies.   buant chocolate chip.   and we want peanut butter.  what am i gonna do, sir barney.  i can't make both kinds.  oh, this is a problem.  i know.  let's ask the king to decide.   oh, the king.  the king.  we don't have a king.  oh, he's right.  we don't have a king.  or a queen.  oh, forgot about that.  so what do we do.  well, there is an old story that says whoever pulls the sword from the sand is king or queen of the kingdom.  what sword.  what sand.  i think it's right over there.   ahh.  that sword.  ..  or king.  all we have to do is pull that out of the sand.  that's right.  let's go.  cool.  i'm first.   be careful.  watch this.  i'll pull the sword out of the sand, and i'll be king.  i want to try first.  well, hold on.  everyone will get to try if we all take turns.  let's see now.  jackie, would you like to try.  sure.  step back and watch how a real queen does it.   what's wrong with this thing.  i can't move it.  can i try again.  certainly.  if you can't do it the first time, you should try and try again.   once upon a time the ducky couldn't swim    he couldn't even fly    but he kept watching his friends    again and again    until he flapped his wings and flew high in the sky     he kept trying and trying    every day and night    trying and trying    until he got it right    not too long ago    i couldn't ride a bike    i couldn't make the wheels go round    but i kept doing my best    and tried again and again    until i started to go    and pedaled all over town    i kept trying and trying    every day and night    trying and trying    until i got it right    keep trying    and trying    every day and night    trying and trying    and you will get it right       and you will get it right    and you    will    get    it right      well, we all tried and tried and tried.  and nobody could do it.  i guess that means no queen.  or king.  well, there is one person who hasn't tried yet.  who's that, sir barney.  yeah, who hasn't tried yet.  i tried.  i tried already.  there's artie the chef.  ththe chef.  how could he be the king.  he's way too little.   ..  a chef can't be a king.  can he.  they're right, sir barney.  i can't be a king.  are you sure about that, artie.  why don't you try.  oh, i don't know, sir barney.  you'll never know unless you try.  come on, artie.  give it a try.  yeah, can't hurt to try.  just do your best.  that's all that anyone can ask.  well, it's true.   when you do your best you sparkle and shine    never give up though it may take some time    to learn the things you want to do    always do your best and see it through    each time you try a little more    you'll be better than before    anything is possible for you        and when you do your best    you sparkle and shine    never give up though it may take some time    to learn the things you want to do    always do your best and see it through    you might run a little faster    or jump a little higher    maybe find a way to rocket to the moon     so do your best    you'll sparkle and shine    never give up though it may take some time    to learn the things you want to do    always do your best    and see it through   oh, you can do it.  i know you can.  you can do it.  you can.  well, okay.  go for it, artie.  here it goes.   all right.  oh, boy.  oh, boy.  go.    whoa.  don't give up, artie.  give it another try.  okay.  come on.       whoa.   i did it.  i did it.  great going, your highness.  three cheers for king artie.   hip hip hooray.  hip hip hooray.  hip hip hooray.  oh, congratulations, king artie.  it's amazing what you can do when you try.  it sure is.  thanks, sir barney.  hold on.  what are we going to do about the cookies.  oh, now that we have a king, we can ask him.  so what kind of cookies will it be, king artie.  well, as the king of this kingdom, ..  peanut butter chocolate chip cookies.   great idea.  awesome.  artie didn't think he could do it.  and that is why it's always best to give it a try.  you see, you'll never know till you try a thing.  and that's how artie the chef became artie the king.   "and they all lived happily ever after.  " thanks, barney.  that was great.  i guess there is a lot you can do when you try.  that's right, daniel.   oh, hi, barney.  hi, daniel.   hi, everyone.   are you two doing okay.  we surely are.  yep, doing great.  we were sort of worried about you.  yeah, you seemed kind of sad.  well, i'm not sad now.  in fact, i'm happy.  yeah, you sure look like it.  oh, yes, he's happy, and he knows it.  well, how about you.  are you happy.  then why don't you show me.  come on.  oh, boy.        if you're happy and you know it    clap your hands   clap, clap.   if you're happy and you know it    clap your hands   clap, clap.   if you're happy and you know it    then your face will surely show it    if you're happy and you know it    clap your hands   clap, clap.  okay, everybody.  now we're going to stamp our feet.  are you ready.  here we go.    if you're happy and you know it    stamp your feet   stomp, stomp.   if you're happy and you know it    stamp your feet   stomp, stomp.   if you're happy and you know it    then your face will surely show it    if you're happy and you know it    stamp your feet   stomp, stomp.  oh, oh, now we're going to shout hooray.  come on, everybody, and shout with us.    if you're happy and you know it    shout hooray   hooray.   if you're happy and you know it    shout hooray   hooray.   if you're happy and you know it    then your face will surely show it    if you're happy and you know it    shout hooray   hooray.  now we're going to clap, stamp, and shout.  let's do it.    if you're happy and you know it    do all three   hooray.   if you're happy and you know it    do all three   hooray.   if you're happy and you know it    then your face will surely show it    if you're happy and you know it    do all three   hooray.   yay.   we had a great day.  thanks, barney.  oh, how about a game of soccer.  yeah, let's do it.  do you want to play too, daniel.  well, i never played soccer before.  me neither.  we'll show you how.  thanks, i might not be too good at it at first, but if i keep trying, i'm sure i can do it.   you probably can.   cool, well, come on.  let's go.   all right, well, bye.   bye, barney.  see you later.  thanks, barney.  you're very welcome, daniel.  bye. see you soon.  byebye.  see ya.  there are so many things we can do if we try.  sometimes all we need is a little help from the ones we love.   i love you    you love me    we're a happy family    with a great big hug    and a kiss from me to you    won't you say     i love you    you love me    we're best friends like friends should be    with a great big hug    and a kiss from me to you    won't you say you love    me     captioning bycaptionmax  hello again to all my friends.  i'm glad you came to play.  our fun and learning never end.  here's what we did today.  when daniel tried jumping rope with his friends, he had a little trouble, and that made him feel a little sad.  so i told him the tale of young chef artie, who lived in a kingdom with no king.  a legend said whoever pulled the sword from the sand would be the king.  everyone tried, but no one could do it until chef artie tried, and he did it.  now he was king artie.  and daniel understood there are lots of things you can do if only you try.  and remember, i love you.    snap.    clap.  wink.    hop.  make a silly face.  ahahaahaahhh.   cartwheel.   what can you do.  boing.    time for barney's music box.   mooooo.    old macdonald had a farm    eieio    and on this farm he had a cow    eieio    with a moomoo here    and a moomoo there    here a moo, there a moo    everywhere a moomoo    old macdonald had a farm    eieio   moooooo.  captioning bycaptionmax www.     doink.   pbs kids.  chuck e. cheese's, proud supporter of pbs kids.  helping kids discover that doing something feels a whole lot better than doing nothing. )
