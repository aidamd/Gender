that.  would you like to hear his story.  sure, i guess.  okay.  whoa.   here it is.  this is one of my favorite stories.  once upon a time, there lived a boy named aladdin.  he didn't have many toys, but he was happy.  one day, he found an old lamp.  he rubbed it, and a genie appeared.  "you set me free from the lamp," said the genie.  "i will grant you " aladdin asked for mounds of candy, piles of toys, and a big house.  "your wishes are my command," said the genie.  aladdin thought the wishes would make him ..  eating too much candy made his tummy hurt.  and he had so many toys, he didn't know which to play with.  and the house was so big, he couldn't find his room.  aladdin didn't want the candy or toys or the big house.  all he wanted was his friends and his family.  they made him very happy.  the end.  i don't know what i'd wish for if i had a magic lamp.  maybe we can wish ourselves to a faraway land.  you think so, barney.  your imagination can take you just about anywhere.  . your imagination .  . can take you anywhere you want to go .  . it's something you thought a lot .  . an idea you've got .  . could be big or small .  . imagine anything at all .   . now, just imagine .  . give it a try .  . come on, imagine .  . everybody reach for the sky .  .
