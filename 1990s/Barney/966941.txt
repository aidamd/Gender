whoa. thank you, victor.  both: barney.  hi, ryan. hi, victor.  so, what are you doing.  we signed up for the big fishing contest in the park.  and we have our glow minnows, see.  this is the bait for the contest.  everybody has to use a glow minnow like this.  oh, i see.  now we're ready to go.  want to come with us.  i'd love to go fishing.  oh, boy.  i'm going to catch a big fish.  me, too.   if we had one wish, we would love to fish    with all our fishing gear    we would like to go out to catch some trout    in a pond or a lake that's near    with a pole    and some bait    and a very special hat    we'd love to go fishin' like we've been wishin'    that's all there is to that    if we had one wish, we would love to fish    with all our fishing gear    we would like to go out to catch some trout   i caught a fish. wow.   in a pond or a lake that's near    with a pole and some bait    and a very special hat    we'd love to go fishin' like we've been wishin'    that's all there is to that    with a pole    and some bait    and aery special hat    we'd love to go fishin' like we've been wishin'    that's all there is to that.   hi, barney.  hi, guys.  hi, bj. hi, riff.  did you sign up for the fishing contest, too.  yep. and did you see the prize, barney.  yeah, whoever catches the biggest fish wins a new fishing pole.  oh, let's go fishing with our glow minnows.  i wish i could use my picklegreen, deep diving, weeddefying scooter bug.  oh, that's a beauty.  i know i could catch a big fish if i could use this.  maybe i should use this...  just for a little while.  i don't think that's a good idea, ryan.  the rules say we have to use the glow minnow.  and we should always be honest and follow the rules, right.  oh, that's right, riff.  honesty is always the best policy.  and that reminds me of a story about an emperor.  what's an emperor, barney.  oh, an emperor is like a king, victor.  and long ago, this emperor had a very special contest.  what kind of contest.  once upon a time, there was a wise old emperor who ruled the country of china.  make way for the emperor.  the children scurried to attention as the great emperor entered the palace.  hiya, guys.  thanks for coming to my palace.  why did you want to see us, great emperor.  well, you see, i'm getting really old and i want to choose one of you to become the new emperor.    just imagine, just imagine    just imagine all the things that we could be    imagine all the places we could go    and see    imagination's fun for you and me    imagination's fun for you and me.   the emperor of china wanted to find someone who was brave and honest to take his place.  okay, now here is how i'm going to choose.  on the pillow before you there is a seed.  please take it home and plant it.  then bring it back to the palace in one year.  no matter how big or small it is, bring it back here and show it to me and i will choose who will be china's next emperor.  i'm going to take good care of my seed so the emperor will be pleased with me.  barney: ling was very good at growing plants, so he found a good strong pot.  he filled it with some dirt and carefully planted the seed.  he made sure it had water every day.  but nothing was growing from the emperor's seed.  and that made ling mad.   ooh, ooh, ooh, i'm really, really mad    ooh, ooh, ooh, he's really mad today    ooh, ooh, ooh, i'm really, really mad    but if you take some slow breaths    your mad will go away   breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe.  did that help.  a little, but...   ooh, ooh, ooh, i'm still really, really mad    ooh, ooh, ooh, he's really mad today    ooh, ooh, ooh, i'm really, really mad    but if you march around the house    your mad will go away    march, march, march, march   did marching help.  a little, but...   ooh, ooh, ooh, i'm still really, really mad    ooh, ooh, ooh, he's really mad today    ooh, ooh, ooh, i'm really, really mad    but if you sing this song again    your mad will go away    la, la, la, lalalalala    la, la, la, lalalalala.   filly, a whole year passed, but no plant grew from the seed the emperor gave to ling.  hi, ling. it's time to take our plants back to the emperor.  wow, your plant looks really great.  thanks. where's yours.   i couldn't get anything to grow.  why don't you just take one of your other plants.  the emperor will never find out.  no, that wouldn't be honest.  i'll just have to tell the truth about what happened.  whoa.  oh, it is truly amazing that these plants grew from the seeds i gave you.  oh, were you not able to make the seed grow, ling.  well... i...  i tried really hard.  i don't know what i did wrong.  i'm sorry, great emperor.  guard.  whoa.  everyone.  behold your new emperor.  what.  huh.  i have chosen ling because he was braveandhonest.  but, great emperor, i, i don't understand.  the seeds i gave you a year ago were rotten seeds.  they couldn't grow anything.  why.  i was testing your courage and honesty, and it took both for ling to bring back an empty pot.  the rest of you must have changed the seed i gave you.  so...  ling is the only one who was honest.  that's right.  he's the only one who passed my test, so ling will be china's new emperor.  make way for emperor ling.  and that's the story of the emperor's contest.  way to go, ling.  what a guy.  the end.   i'm glad ling was honest.  he won the emperor's contest fair and square.  yeah, and that's what i want to do.  like barney said, honesty is always the best policy.  oh, right.   it's better to be honest    it's better to tell the truth    it's better to be honest    always tell the truth    it's better to be honest    it's better to tell the truth    it's better to be honest    always tell the truth    sometimes it's hard    sometimes we make mistakes    but if you tell the truth    then you'll feel really great    sometimes things can happen    and sometimes things go wrong    but if you tell the truth    things get better before too long    it's better to be honest    it's better to tell the truth    it's better to be honest    always tell the truth    don't make something up    and never tell a lie    mmmm.    just always tell the truth    come on. give it a try    it's better to be honest    it's better to tell the truth    it's better to be honest    always tell the truth   i will.   always tell the truth   so will i.   always tell the... truth.    okay, barney.  now i'm ready to catch some fish with this glominnow.  me, too.  oh, we know a great place to get started.  yeah, i hear the fish are really biting over there.  okay. bye, barney.  bye, barney.  see you later.  bye. i'll see you soon.  have fun.  we should always be honest and play by the rules, and having good friends to help us always makes it more fun.   i'm so happy you're the one    that's here today, having fun    wherever we go, whatever we do    it's better with a friend like you    everything's better with a friend    everything's better with a friend like you    playing, pretending, whatever we do    it's better with a friend like you    everything's better with a friend    everything's better with a friend like you

twinkle little star    how i wonder what you are.    good job.  that was great.  thanks.  thanks.  barney.  mmmm.  if i couldn't hear, would i still like music.  now... there was once a very famous man who couldn't hear, and he loved music.  oh, who was that.  his name was beethoven.  well, come on.  let's go find out more about him.  yeah.  let's go.  this way.  ludwig van beethoven was a composer.  what's a composer.  well... you know how an author is someone who writes books.  mmhmm.  a composer is someone who writes music.  right.  but instead of using abc's, they use notes, like this.   even though beethoven couldn't hear, he wrotebeautifulmusic.  hey, barney, how could he write and play music if he couldn't hear it.  well, let's use our imaginations and ask mr. beethoven.   good afternoon, barney.  hi, there, mr. beethoven.  wow.  cool.  tippertyda.  it's so good to see you.  me, too.  can you please write down the names of your friends.  certainly.  thank you.  mr. beethoven can speak, but he can't hear us, so i'll write down your names, and he can read them.  riff: oh. okay.  there you go.  aha.  it's very nice to meet you, dana and riff and tyler and tracy.  nice to meet you, too.  riff: oh, likewise.  now, i believe you were wondering how it is that i can write music even though i cannot hear it.  is this true.  kids: mmhmm.  try this.  think of your most favorite song.  can you hear it in your head.  kids: yeah.  that is how it is withmymusic.  i hear it in my head and feel it in my heart.  i imagine what the music sounds like.  would you like to hear mr. beethoven play the piano.  yeah.  oh, yeah.  that'd be cool.  but we don't have a piano.  oh, i think i can fix that.  oh, whoa.  cool.  look at that.  it's beautiful.  oh, thank you.  shall i play for you.  yes, please.  oh, yes, yes, yes.  come on, everyone.  oh, this is so exciting.  here is some music which i wrote.  oh.  okay.     very nice.   riff : oh, tyler.    oh, teeriffic.  wahoo.  mr. beethoven cannot hear us, i'll get his attention.  keep clapping.  riff: oh, okay.  mr. beethoven.   oh, thank you, thank you.  i'm so pleased you enjoyed my music.  you like the piano, child.  oh, yes, sir.  would you like to play a song with me, dana.  oh, yes, sir.  what a superdeeduper idea.  what shall we play.  may i look through the sheet music.  oh.  how about this one.  one of my favorites.      ooh, wowzer.  that was tippitytop.  oh, it sure was.  shall we play it through once more.  yes, sir.  and this time we can sing along.  riff: yes.  barney: come on.  barney/riff/kids:  the itsy, bitsy spider went up the water spout    down came the rain and washed the spider out    out came the sun and dried up all the rain    and the itsy, bitsy spider went up the spout again.    oh, that was great.  nice.  dana, that was magnificent.  thank you.  thank you so much for inviting me to play.  it's been a great pleasure meeting you all, but i must be off.  okay.  aww...  goodbye, everyone.  bye.  bye.  thanks, mr. beethoven.  thank you all.  i hope you will continue to enjoy my music for many years to come.  barney: we will.  dana: thanks.  riff: yeah, we will.  all: bye.  byebye.  well, riff, you were wondering if you'd like music if you couldn't hear.  what do you think now.  well... you know, i think i would, barney.  because even if i couldn't hear with my ears, i know i could feel it in my heart.  like mr. beethoven.  yeah.  it's always fun to listen to music...  and to play it.  right.  but the best way to enjoy music is to share it with the people we love.    i love you, you love me    we're a happy family    with a great big hug and a kiss from me to you    won't you say you love me, too.    i love you, you love me    we're best friends like friends should be    with a great big hug and a kiss from me to you    won't you say you love me, too.   aah, well, it was so cool meeting mr. beethoven.  yeah.  thanks. barney.  all
