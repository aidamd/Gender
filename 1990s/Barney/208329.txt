could be summer forever.   summer's a wonderful time of year, but the other seasons bring their own kind of fun.  the winds of autumn make for great kite flying.   i like drinking hot chocolate on a nice cool night.   i like playing in piles of leaves.  that's my favorite.   and don't forget halloween.   oh, no. that's right.  when the weather turns chilly, the pumpkins grow big and round and orange.  there's a lot to like about autumn.   i like to roll in the leaves, feel the cool breeze    stuff a scarecrow top to bottom    and you can call it "fall" if that's what you please    but i say, "   all:  oh, scoodle oppa doodle oppa deedle oppa deeze    our jackets, we're glad we brought 'em    and you can call it "fall" if that's what you please    but i say, "     i like to roll in the leaves     feel the cool breeze     stuff a scarecrow top to bottom     and you can call it "fall" if that's what you please    "   all:  oh, scoodle oppa doodle oppa deedle oppa deeze    our jackets, we're glad we brought 'em    and you can call it "fall" if that's what you please    but i say, "    oh, scoodle oppa doodle oppa deedle oppa deeze    our jackets, we're glad we brought 'em     and you can call it "fall" if that's what you please    but i say, "   all:  yes, you can call it "fall"    if that's what you please    but i say, "     whoa.   cool.   hear that.  it's the autumn wind.   oooh.   whee.    hey, it's baby bop.  all: hi, baby bop.   hi. look.  look, lookee, look.   hey, where did all the butterflies come from.   i don't know, but there they go.   i think they're migrating, like they do every fall.   that's right, emma.  these are monarch butterflies, and they fly south for winter, just like the birds.   why do they do that.   because it gets cold here in the winter, but it stays warm in other places.   and the butterflies like to be where the weather is warm.  it's monty, my very good friend monty.   oh, my.  i believe itismonty.   oh, it's me, baby bop.  do you remember me, monty.  oh.    how did you get it to do that, baby bop.   oh, i've known monty since he was just a little ittybitty baby caterpillar.   caterpillars grow up to be butterflies.  and these must be monty's friends and family.   there are one, two, three of them.   oh, that's right.    three little butterflies looking at you    one flew away, and then there were two   all:  butterfly, butterfly, happy all day    butterfly, butterfly, fly, fly away    byebye.    two little butterflies sitting in the sun    one flew away, and then there was one   all:  butterfly, butterfly, happy all day    butterfly, butterfly, fly, fly away    oh, just one more butterfly.   one little butterfly left all alone    one flew away, and then there was none    butterfly, butterfly, happy all day    butterfly, butterfly, fly, fly away   byebye, little butterfly.   bye.  all:  butterfly, butterfly, happy all day    butterfly, butterfly, fly, fly away    oh, yay, butterflies.  thanks, barney.   you too.   hey, look, there's monty.   what's the matter with him.  seems kind of worked up about something.   i think he may be looking for his friends and family.   oh, yeah, where'd they all go.   oh, monty, we'll help.  butterflies.  here, little butterflies.   look, cuz, they're playing hideandseek.   they can hide, but we can seek 'em.   come on.  we'll find 'em.   olly olly oxen free.  come out, come out, wherever you are.   am i getting warmer, colder.  warm. cold. warm.   what who are we looking for, anyway.   the butterflies.  ..   flies.   there was a whole flock of butterflies a minute ago, but now they're gone.   oh, where'd they go.   we don't know.  that's why we're looking.   uhoh.  maybe while we were playing with monty, the others went ahead and flew south for winter.   and left monty behind.   oh. oh.  what should i do.       what should i do when     should i make     should i cross my arms   whoa.    should i count the ticktocks on the clock                what should i do when       should i shout     should i ring my mom                what should i do when   all:  what should i do.     all:  what should i do.     all:  what should i do when       oh, poor monty.   come on, let's see if we can find the other butterflies.   i'll be there in a minute.   okay. let's go.   see you later.   okay, byebye.   oh. oh, oh.  i have an idea.  monty can stay here with me.  oh, we'll have lots of fun together.   i don't know, sissy.  he still seems sort of, you know, sad.  i think he misses his friends.   oh, and when it gets cold, the flowers that butterflies like won't be in bloom anymore.   yeah, he won't have anything to eat.   i'll make him macaroni and cheese.    sissy, i don't think butterflies eat mac and cheese.   well, they go to mexico every winter, where it's warm and there's plenty to eat.   they go to mexico.   uhhuh.   that sounds very far away.   do you know what.  i have a pen pal there.   yeah, her name is amorita.  she tells me all about mexico.  sounds like a fantastic place.   maybe monty would like to go to see his friends and family.   well, what do you say, monty, old pal.   oh, i think that's butterfly "  but no, siree.  i think hehehe just has the hiccups.   i have an idea.  why don't we all take a little endofsummer vacation to mexico.   all right.   cool.  both: we're going on vacation.
