ava and laura.  all right, bye.  remember, the more you practice, the better you'll be.  but, barney, i've been practicing all day and i still can't get it right.   at times, i feel like i just don't belong    and i never get anything right    doing my best doesn't seem good enough    no matter how hard i try    will i ever be brave and reach for the sky.    will i always be scared for the rest of my life.    i see other kids and they get it all right    so why can't i.    what if i don't know an answer.    what if i don't know the way    will someone laugh or make fun of me    what will the other kids say.    will i ever be brave and reach for the sky.    will i always be scared for the rest of my life.    i see other kids and they get it all right    so why can't i.    so why can't i.

"once upon a time, a little star lived high in the sky.  "every night, it looked down on the earth "and saw pretty lights far below.  "the little star wanted to see the beautiful lights up close, "so it floated down to earth.  oh, but soon, "it was morning, and that's bedtime for stars.  "the little star jumped as high as it could, "but it wasn't able to get back to the sky.  the little star thought it would never get back home." oh, the poor little star.  "it blinked to the other stars, 'help. please help me.' "so the other stars made a long chain "all the way down to the ground, "and they gave the little star a hand up to the sky.  oh.  "the little star was very happy to be home, and every night, you can still see it twinkling in the sky." the end. oh, yay.  i knew the little star would get back home.  that was a good story, barney.  'course there's no way it could ever happen.  oh, bj, it could, too.  couldn't it, barney.  most anything can happen, if you just imagine.  oh, barney.   just imagine, just imagine    just imagine all the things that we could be    imagine all the places we could go and see    imagination's fun for you and me    we could go to the moon in a great big balloon    build a castle by playing pretend    we might even explore with a big dinosaur    or make rainbows that never end    just imagine, just imagine    just imagine all the things that we could be    imagine all the places we could go and see    imagination's fun for you and me.    oh...     imagination's fun for you and me.    whoa.   wow.  oh... what are you looking at, barney.  just about anything i can imagine.  right now, i'm looking
