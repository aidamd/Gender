 we're getting a brandnew playground for the park.   sissy, they were supposed to guess.   oh, well, guess a new playground.    it is a beauty, isn't it.   yeah.   would you look at that.  um, will the new playground go here.   maybe.  i'm not sure just yet.  if we put it here, this tree will have to be cut down.   oh, no.   got to think about that.  well, see you around.   okay, bye, mr. copeland.   bye, mr. copeland.   i wish they wouldn't cut down this tree.  there's a bird's nest in it.   well, somebody better tell that bird this tree's got to go.   this is their home, b.j.  many animals live in trees.   like squirrels.   and frogs  do frogs really live in trees.    well, some do.  frogs can even live in the desert, but  well  well, that one lives over in the meadow.    oh, wow.    over in the meadow in the sand, in the sun    lived an old mother frog and her little froggy one     "croak," said the mother    "i croak," said the one   all:  so they croaked, and they croaked    in the sand, in the sun      over in the meadow in the stream so blue    lived an old mother fish and her little fishies too     "swim," said the mother    "we swim," said the two   all:  so they swam, and they swam    in the stream so blue        over in the meadow on the branch of a tree    lived an old mother bird and her little birdies three     "sing," said the mother    "we sing," said the three   all:  so they sang, and they sang    on the branch of the tree       that meadow has all kinds of guys in it.   animals live all around us, and the earth gives us air to breathe, water to drink, and food to eat.   and a great place for a new playground.   i just wish they didn't have to cut down this tree.   ah.   yeah.   we got zillions of them.   there's only one tree like this.   did i ever tell you about the oneandonly, oneofakind, higgledypiggledy pear tree.   huh, the whatawhatawhata tree.    the higgledypiggledy pear tree.  oh, there's only one left in the whole world.  would you like to hear about it.   oh, you bet.   please.   okay, well, take a seat.   oh, boy.   once, there was a very special tree.  it had beautiful branches and leaves and, at the very top, a great big juicy higgledypiggledy pear.   oh, yum.  sounds yummy.    oh, it was deelicious.  but when people climbed up to get it, they broke the tree.   i never heard about this tree before.   well, not many people have.  to keep it safe, mother nature planted a magic garden that grew around it till the higgledypiggledy tree was hidden deep in a rainforest.   what's a rainforest.   a place where there's so much rain, the plants grow into a wonderful jungle.   oh, oh, i wish i could see that higgypiggypoogy the oneandonly, oneofakind higgledypiggledy tree.   exactly.   well, they say it's pretty hard to find.   well, i'll bet we could do it if we looked hard enough.   yeah.   but how could we get to the rainforest.   oh, we could use our imaginations.  ..  yo.   barney's travel book.    that's right.   there are so many places we can go    there's just so much to see    uhhuh.    if we use our imaginations    we can be anywhere we want to be   all:  now here we go again    we're travelin'    there's a great big world to see    we're gonna have fun, you know, everywhere we go    a new adventure for you and me     yes, we are.   let's go.    meet a friend or two    that's what we'll do    and learn how they live each day    we're going to travel around this great big world    in a new and exciting way   okay.   okay.  all:  now here we go again    we're travelin'    there's a great big world to see    we're gonna have fun, you know, everywhere we go    a new adventure for you and me     well, here we go.   well, here we are.   so cool.   awesome.   the rainforest.   wow.   so this is a rainforest, huh.   uhhuh.   yes.  welcome to the rainforest.    wow.  oh, everyone, meet mother nature.   hi, mother nature.   you look like somebody i know.    i hear that a lot.   great galloping geraniums.  these plants look thirsty.   and here comes the rain, right on time.   oh, no, she's right.   where did i put that umbrella.   kerplink.   kerplop.  thank you.  all: kerplink.  kerplop.  kerplink, kerplop, kerplink, kerplop.    for the flowers and the trees    and the fishes in the seas    the raindrops drop all around     helping rivers flow and your garden grow    as they fall from the sky to the ground    when the rain goes kerplop, all the animals stop    at a pool for a nice cool drink     they are just like you    they get thirsty too    but you get your water from a sink     and the rain can make a puddle    so the birds can splash all around    taking a bath and chirping away   all:  singing happily to the raindrops    when they make this sound    kerplink.   kerplop.   kerplink.   kerplop.   kerplink.   kerplop.  all: kerplink, kerplop.   yes, the rain can make a puddle    so the birds can splash all around    taking a bath and chirping away    singing happily to the raindrops    when they make this sound   kerplink, kerplop, kerplink, kerplop.  in those puddles, i love to hop.  i don't care if it never stops.  yeah, we love the raindrops.   now, what brings you to the rrrrrrainforest.    we're looking for the oneandonly, oneofakind higgledypiggledy tree.   babababloomin' begonias.  that tree's very rare, you know.  hardly anyone knows where it is.   aw, we can find it if we try.   would you help us.   well, i don't know.   oh, please.  ..  all right.  but you must promise to remember something.   what.   come close.   yeah, what is it.   we share this earth with all the plants and animals.  take care of them, and they'll take care of you.   right, got it.  now, which way do we go.   well, right down that path.   come on, guys.   all right.   whoo.  leaping lilies.  somebody needs a trim.   are you coming.   oh, uh, no, you go on.  we'll catch up.   i knew we should have stopped and asked for directions.  we're never gonna find ituh.   oh, iiis that wwwhat i think it is.   it's got to be.   the oneandonly, oneofakind higgledypiggledy tree.   i've never seen anything like it.   'cause there isn't anything like it, my friend.  it's the only one left in the world.   oh, oh, and there's the higgypiggy pear.    just look at that thing.  barney said it's delicious.  i got to taste it.   yeah.   we are not climbing this tree.  it might break.   oh, no, we were just suggesting that.  we weren't really gonna do it.   maybe if i kind of bump the tree, it'll fall out.   i don't think that's a good idea.   sure, it is.  bump it harder.   bump it harder, okay.   yeah, harder.   don't hurt the tree, b.j.    tracy, i can't hurt this tree.  there, see what i mean.     oh.   uhoh.  oh, oh.   b.j., you knocked it down.   ooh, oh, man, i didn't mean to.  maybe we can fix it.  oh, ayyiyi, what should i do.  what should i do.  all:  what should i do.     what should i do when i don't know       should i make    oh.    should i cross my arms     should i count   all:  when i haven't got a clue             what should i do when i don't know         should i shout   oh, no.    should i ring my mom     i'm feeling so confused             what should i do when i don't know     all:  what should i do.     what should i do.     what should i do when i don't know      ugh.  oh, there's no way to fix this.   b.j, they're coming.   oh, stand it up.  stand it up.   oh, you're gonna get in trouble.   act natural.    oh, well, you found it.    hey, barney, mother nature.   hi.   isn't it awesome.    oh, yes, it's really something, isn't it.   um, is everything okay, .   sure.   no, it isn't.   yes, it is.  oh, i mean, no, it isn't.   hmm.   we weren't too careful.   and there was a little accident.   and i sort of broke the oneandonly, oneofakind higgledypiggledy tree.  crack.   oh.  crash.   oh.   no.   oh, my.   oh, i'm really, really sorry.   and this was the only one.   you poor, poor thing.   mother nature, we are so sorry.   is there anything we can do.    well, maybe.  you see, inside the higgledypiggledy pear, there's a seed.   if we plant it, will it grow.   it will take a long time and a lot of care.  but someday, the seed inside this pear will become a fullgrown tree.   it's a seed of the future.   hmm, that's right, tracy.  we can plant the seed now, and mother nature will watch over it and protect it.   i certainly will, but, you know, i can always use some help when it comes to watching over this big, beautiful earth.   how can we help.   well, some ways to care for our earth include picking up trash and planting new plants and protecting the animals.   i can do that.   me too.   oh, me too.   then let's get started by planting this seed.   all right.    oh, okay.   will you help protect    yes, we will.    will you help protect    yes, we will.    then the time has come to start    let's begin to do our part   all:  and we'll all protect

got a great playground right there.  why do we need one here.   yeah, maybe there's a better place for a new playground.   well, any suggestions.   well, uh, there's a nice open spot on the other side of the pond.   oh, that just might work.   i never saw kids so happy about moving a playground, barney.    oh, i think they're most of all happy that the tree can stay.    oh, yeah.  nothing's gonna happen to this guy while ole b.j.'s around.   right, it's the future, you know.   that's right, tracy.   now, where's that open spot.   come on, i'll show you.   oh, i want to go too.   okay, all
