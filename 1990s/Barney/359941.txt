meet to play    and sing with happy faces.    barney shows us lots of things    like how to play pretend    abcs and 123s and how to be a friend.     barney comes to play with us whenever we may need

really, really high.  whoa.  oh, b.j., be careful.  be careful. why.  ow.  that's why.  b.j.: oh, right.  i sort of thought "be careful" just meant "quit having so much fun." when someone says "be careful," it means they don't want you to get hurt because they care about you.  oh, i guess i never really looked at it that way before.   saying "be careful"...   kids: saying "be careful"...    means< "i love you."   i love you. aw...   saying "be careful" means that i love you, i do.         because i care, i'm careful, too.   b.j.: well, that's cool.  it is.       friends watch out for friends, it's true    that's why i watch out for you.    if we stick together when we play    we'll have fun the safest way.   there you go.  all:  all around us we can find    special friends who are so kind.   wow.       crossing guards and police, too    watching out for me and you    saying "be careful"...   saying "be careful"...   means "i love you."   right this way.  i love you.      all:

 oh, thanks, guys.  b.j., come see our friendsandfamily tree.  oh, cool.  each heart has the name of someone we care for or who cares for us.  let's make some more hearts for people like crossing

course not everyone has a brother or sister, and that's just fine.  but it can be nice to have a brother or sister to play with, share with, and love.  baby bop: oh, yay.    my big brother, he's number one.    when we're together, we have lots of fun.     sometimes he makes me mad    but i'm glad he's my brother.   both:  my brother    my brother...    i'm glad i have a brother.   b.j.: and i'm so cool.   my big brother, he's my best friend    i love when we're together playing pretend    sometimes he makes me mad    but i'm glad he's my brother.   both:  my brother    my brother...    i'm glad i have a brother.   b.j.: take it, sissy.   my big brother's a dinosaur    and when we play, i like to hear him roar.    roar.   sometimes he makes me mad...   no way.   but i'm glad    he's my brother.   both:  my brother    my brother...    i'm glad i have a brother.    my brother, my brother    i'm glad that i'm your brother.    oh, right this way.  here you go.   hi, guys.  ooh, what is that.  it's a friendsandfamily tree,, and each heart has a name of someone we care about.  would you and b.j. like to make hearts with each other's names on them.  i sure would, because she's my sister.  and he's my brother.  i would make hearts for a brother or sister, but i don't have any.  neither do i.  but i'm sure if we think about it, we can find more names for you to put on hearts.  yeah, like, uh...   the doctor.  all: the doctor..  well, sure.  the doctor cares about helping us stay healthy and happy, and that makes the doctor our friend.   b.j.:  first the doctor checks my ears and nose    and everything from the neck up    then comes my tummy and my legs and toes    soon i'm finished with my checkup.   all:  and i'm feeling extra fine    healthy most all of the time   ut when i'm sick, the doctor will help    because the doctor is a friend of mine    the doctor is a friend of mine    yes, the doctor is a friend of mine.       b.j.:  i like to hear my heart beating tick, tick, tick    if i march, it even beats quicker    when the doctor's through and i'm all done    sometimes i even get a sticker.   all:  and i'm feeling extra fine    healthy most all of the time    but when i'm sick, the doctor will help    because the doctor is a friend of mine.     the doctor is a friend of mine    yes, the doctor is a friend of mine.    b.j.: and that's for dr. towles.  what's your doctor.  mine's dr. rivera.  oh, you had a good idea, b.j.  it looks like everyone is making a heart with their doctor's name.  i had to make two hearts for my doctor.  oh, why.  because my doctor is also my grandmother.   really. your nana is a doctor.  uhhuh, only i don't call her nana.  i call her grandma.  i call mine memaw.  nana.  nanagrandma.  nanagrandmamemaw.  who are they talking about.  those are all different names for a grandmother.  and there are other names for a grandfather.  oh.  well, i think all of those names should go on the friendsandfamily tree.   so do i, because grandparents are people who love us very much.  b.j.: yeah.  barney:  you might call her grandma or maybe even nana...    or you might call her memaw, too.   all:  but no matter what the name, she loves you just the same    'cause loving you is what she likes to do, do, do.    no matter what the name...    she loves you just the same...   all:  'cause loving you is what she likes to do.    you might call him grandpa...    or poppa or gramps...    or granddaddy sometimes, too.   all:  but no matter what the name, he loves you just the same    'cause loving you is what he likes to do, do, do.    no matter what the name, he loves you just the same    'cause loving you is what he likes to do.       barney:  maybe it's grandma and grandpa...    b.j.:  or granny and gramps   baby bop:  or nana and poppa, too.   all:  but no matter what the name, they love you just the same    'cause loving you is what they like to do, do, do.   barney:  no matter what the name, they love you just the same   all:  'cause loving you is what they like to do.        no matter what the name    they love you just the same    'cause loving you is what they like to do.    )
