has a brother or sister, and that's just fine.  but it can be nice to have a brother or sister to play with, share with, and love.  baby bop: oh, yay.    my big brother, he's number one.    when we're together, we have lots of fun.     sometimes he makes me mad    but i'm glad he's my brother.   both:  my brother    my brother...    i'm glad i have a brother.   b.j.: and i'm so cool.   my big brother, he's my best friend    i love when we're together playing pretend    sometimes he makes me mad    but i'm glad he's my brother.   both:  my brother    my brother...    i'm glad i have a brother.   b.j.: take it, sissy.   my big brother's a dinosaur    and when we play, i like to hear him roar.    roar.   sometimes he makes me mad...   no way.   but i'm glad    he's my brother.   both:  my brother    my brother...    i'm glad i have a brother.    my brother, my brother    i'm glad that i'm your brother.    oh, right this way.  here you go.   hi, guys.  ooh, what is that.  it's a friendsandfamily tree,, and each heart has a name of someone we care about.  would you and b.j. like to make hearts with each other's names on them.  i sure would, because she's my sister.  and he's my brother.  i would make hearts for a brother or sister, but i don't have any.  neither do i.  but i'm sure if we think about it, we can find more names for you to put on hearts.  yeah, like, uh...   the doctor.  all: the doctor..  well, sure.  the doctor cares about helping us stay healthy and happy, and that makes the doctor our friend.   b.j.:  first the doctor checks my ears and nose    and everything from the neck up    then comes my tummy and my legs and toes    soon i'm finished with my checkup.   all:  and i'm feeling extra fine    healthy most all of the time   ut when i'm sick, the doctor will help    because the doctor is a friend of mine    the doctor is a friend of mine    yes, the doctor is a friend of mine.       b.j.:  i like to hear my heart beating tick, tick, tick    if i march, it even beats quicker    when the doctor's through and i'm all done    sometimes i even get a sticker.   all:  and i'm feeling extra fine    healthy most all of the time    but when i'm sick, the doctor will help    because the doctor is a friend of mine.     the doctor is a friend of mine    yes, the doctor is a friend of mine.    b.j.: and that's for dr. towles.  what's your doctor.  mine's dr. rivera.  oh, you had a good idea, b.j.  it looks like everyone is making a heart with their doctor's name.  i had to make two hearts for my doctor.  oh, why.  because my doctor is also my grandmother.   really. your nana is a doctor.  uhhuh, only i d't call her nana.  i call her grandma.  i call mine memaw.  nana.  nanagrandma.  nanagrandmamemaw.  who are they talking about.  those are all different names for a grandmother.  and there are other names for a grandfather.  oh.  well, i think all of those names should go on the fendsandfamily tree.   so do i, because grandparents are people who love us very much.  b.j.: yeah.  barney:  you might call her grandma or maybe even nana...    or you might call her memaw, too.   all:  but no matter what the name, she loves you just the same    'cause loving you is what she likes to do, do, do.    no matter what the name...    she loves you just the same...   all:  'cause loving you is what she likes to do.    you might call him grandpa...    or poppa or gramps...    or granddaddy sometimes, too.   all:  but no matter what the name, he loves you just the same    'cause loving you is what he likes to do, do, do.    no matter what the name, he loves you just the same    'cause loving you is what he likes to do.       barney:  maybe it's grandma and grandpa...    b.j.:  or granny and gramps   baby bop:  or nana and poppa, too.   all:  but no matter what the name, they love you just the same    'cause loving you is what they like to do, do, do.   barney:  no matter what the name, they love you just the same   all:  'cause loving you is what they like to do.        no matter what the name    they love you just the same    'cause loving you is what they like to do.    nick, whitney and david were pretending to be

each other, they do nice things, like sharing, using good manners and taking turns.  and we do care about each other, because we're all friends.  that's right.  barney:  oh, we take turns   children:

are a lot of people we love and care for and who care for us.   oh, it looks stupendous.  and lookwe've still got lots of hearts left over.  but what should we do with them.  well, um... i have an idea.    there they go.  barney, why did you do that.  because love is meant to be shared with other people and with the whole world.  and when you give love to others, you may be surprised at the love that comes back.    i like to run and jump and play    there's so many things to do    i like it even better when it's with a friend or two.   all:  being together, with friends, is what i like

a helping hand.  barney brings the essential skills your child needs for caring and emotional development.  it's important for children to learn that people care about them in many different ways.  in this episode, barney and his friends make a friendsandfamily tree to remind them of the people they love and the many people who care about them.  playing with dolls can help young children learn to be more compassionate and understanding of others.  b.j. learns that doctors care for us by helping us to stay healthy, and when people say "be careful," it means they're looking out for us and want us to be safe.  barney reminds the children that taking turns is another way to show kindness for others.  it's important for children to know that many people care about them and want them to be safe.  think about the many ways you show love to your child and remember to give a g hug, too.  barneya helping hand for growing children.  to learn moreaboutbarney & friends...  know.  i know how to
