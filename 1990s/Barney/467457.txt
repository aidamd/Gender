'cause they grow that way.   but why.   natalia, you ask so many questions.   'cause i want to know.  do you know why.  do you, barney.   whoahohoho.  oh, hello.  all: barney.   hi, everyone.  so what's everyone doing on this beautiful day.   we're trying to figure out why

make sure you get my good side.   say cheese.   cheese.   cheddar.  i can't stand like this forever.   is something wrong, natalia.   what is that.   huh.  oh.   looks like an egg.   oh, better not touch it, joshua.   that's right.  the mom might come back for it.  we should leave it alone.   where could it have come from.   an eggcellent question.    well, some baby animals come from eggs.   but what kind of animal lays such weirdlooking eggs.    i know.  maybe the easter bunny left it.   uhhuh, sure.   yeah, right.   hmm, what could it be.  oh, this might take some serious thinking.   right, barney.  hmm, let me think.   i'd like to think of something i've never thought before   all:  if it doesn't happen right away     i'll think a little more    i'll sit a little while     imagine what could be    and a new idea might come to me   all:  i'd like to think of something new    something fun to do    maybe solve a problem or fix a thing or two    if i sit a little while i'm

    oh, a home is a place to live in    to eat and sleep and be    with the people you love and care about    yes, that's a home to me    and maybe it's a little house    or a big house    or a farm with an old pet dog    or maybe it's a palace    or an apartment    or a cabin made from logs    oh, a home is a place to live in    to eat and sleep and be    with the people you love and care about    yes, that's a home to me    and maybe it's a brick house    or a wooden house    or a house shaped like a ball    or then again a houseboat    or a mobile home    we've nearly named them all    oh, a home is a place to live in    to eat and sleep and be    with the people you love and care about    yes, that's a home to me    with the people you love and care about    yes, that's a home to me    hey, everyone, here comes my friend jeff.   oh, wow.   oh, my.   and he has a real, live, livin', breathin' elephant.   her name is kamba.   oh.    how big is she.   well, she looks like she's about eight feet tall.   wow.   that's right, barney.   oh, neato.   that's a lot of elephant.   what does she eat to grow so big.   elephants are vegetarians.   that's right, like grass and leaves and roots and even tree bark.   whoa.   she didn't hatch out of an egg, did she.    no, she didn't.   kamba, you are one cool elephant.   oh, yes, she is, really cool.    the elephant     elephant     the elephant   all:  elephant     the ground, it shakes     elephant     every time she walks     elephant     and she sounds like a trumpet    whenever she talks     the elephant     elephant      the elephant   all:  elephant     the elephant   all:  elephant    ahhh.   whoahohoho.   awesome.   i wish i could take kamba home with me.    oh, i don't think elephants make very good pets, b.j.   no, they really don't.    yeah, you'd have to find a place for her to sleep, and hey, where do elephants sleep, anyways.   huh, anywhere they want.    that's right, barney.  well, you know, it's time for us to get down to the river.  it's time for kamba's bath.  byebye.   byebye.  bye, jeff. bye, kamba.   bye, kamba.    whoa, did you hear that.  i think she was talking to us.   i think she was saying goodbye.   well, could be.  every animal talks in its own special way.  hohoho, ho.   every animal talks in its own special way    now let's listen to what some animals have to say     eeeeee, eeeeee    the monkey wants to say    eeeeee, eeeeee    how are you today   both:  roar, roar    the lion will let you know    roar, roar    it wants to say hello     every animal talks in its own special way     oh, yeah     now let's listen to what some animals have to say     squawksquawk, squawksquawk    a bird will say that when    squawksquawk, squawksquawk    it wants to be your friend   all:  the world is full of animals    from big to very small    each one is so different    wish we could meet them all    whoahohoho.  all:  every animal talks in its own special way    they are so much fun 'cause they have a lot to say    ohhoho, that's right.   awesome.   yeah.   hey, here comes my other friend, mark, and he brought his other animal friends.   oooh.   wow.   that is one big kitty cat.   it is.   this is keto, and he's a serval cat.   well, hello there, keto.   oh, will he grow bigger than this.   no, they're a mediumsized cat here in africa.   he's so beautiful.   yeah. he sure is.   look at his fur and all the spots.   whoa, he even has spots on the back of his ears.  look, guys.   look, he does.   why does he have such big ears.   the better to hear you with.  did you know servals can jump about ten feet in the air.   wow.   that's cool.   usually, they're nocturnal.   that means they're awake during the night.   that's right, barney.   they don't hatch from eggs, do they.   no, they don't, but wait a sec.  i have another animal friend that does come from an egg.   oh.   i wonder what it could be.   anything but a crocodile.    oh, no.   wow.   this is bakar, and he hatched from an egg.  he's a bateleur eagle.   oh.   cool.  bateleuris the french word for a tightrope walker.   oh, like in a circus.   yes, when he flies, he rocks from side to side with his wings spread in the air.   and he looks like a tightrope walker trying to keep his balance.   oh.   why does he fly like that.   there goes natalia: why, why, why.   it's a very good question.  they have really short tails, so they fly that way to keep their balance.   do you know what kind of animal would lay an egg like this.   it's not abateleuregg.  it looks more like an easter egg to me.    yeah, to me too.  guess we'll never find out what it is.   well, always keep asking questions.  when i was little, i wanted to know all the answers.  both: just like natalia.   that's why i became a zoologist.  it's a kind of scientist.  keep it up, natalia, and some day you might be a scientist too.   oh, i hope so.   then don't give up.  there's lots to learn about our beautiful world.  goodbye, and good luck.   bye.   okay, bye, mark.   byebye.    barney, we still don't know what kind of egg it is.   well, no, but like mark said, if you keep asking questions, you'll learn wonderful new things.  well, it's getting late now.  we better get home, everyone.  oh, and thank you, ayira, for showing us all about kenya.   you're welcome.  come back again.   okay.  and i are gonna stay a little longer.   yeah, we want to see that elephant again.   oh, you betcha.   all right,kwaheri.  kwaheri.   bye, guys.   bye, b.j.   see you later.   thanks, barney.  had a fantastic time.   sure did.   yeah, it was.   oh, you're very welcome.   it was great seeing ayira and all those animals, even if we didn't find out what kind of egg this is.   you'll find the answer someday.  no matter how old we grow, we always keep learning, and the best part is sharing the things we learn with friends we love.   i love you    you love me    we're a happy family    with a great big hug    and a kiss from me to you    won't you say    all:  i love you    you love me    we're best friends like friends should be    with a great big hug    and a kiss from me to you    won't you say    come on, let's

zebras live here too.  look at those stripes.   ..  kenya is also home to the lion.  oh, here, kitty, kitty.  giraffes use their long necks to get leaves from trees.  kenya is a stuuupendous country.
