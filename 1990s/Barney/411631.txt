what're you looking at.  kids: hey, barney.  hi, everyone.  we were looking at the rain.  we wanted to play outside, but it was too wet.  but the rain is very good for the flowers and the trees.  but not so good for us.  well...  what if these raindrops were made out of lemon drops and gumdrops.   that'd be different.  nathan: i'd like that.  they can be, if we use our imaginations.   . if all the raindrops were lemon drops and gumdrops .  . oh, what a rain that would be .  . standing outside with my mouth open wide .  all: . ah ahah, ah ahah, ah ahah ah .  . if all the raindrops were lemon drops and gumdrops .  . oh, what a rain that would be... .  that's better.  . if all the snowflakes were candy bars and milkshakes .  . oh, what a snow that would be .  all: . standing outside with my mouth open wide .  . ah ahah, ah ahah, ah ahah ah .  . if all the snowflakes were candy bars and milkshakes .  . oh, what a snow that would be .  . if all the raindrops were lemon drops and gumdrops .

would be. .   that was great, barney.  oh, man...  it's still raining.  and we still can't play outside.  but there are other things we can do.  like what.  like, uh... make some music.  all: yeah.  let's go see what we have here.  ooh, i want to play the bongos.  me, too.  me, too.  and me, too.  hold on, everybody.  you don't all have to play the bongos.  there are some other instruments, like this bell...  or this triangle...  or the xylophone.  but i want to play the bongos.  victor: i asked first.  but i want to.  so do i.  hmm, uh, maybe we should do something else...  like make some lunch.  kids: yeah.  i know.  we could have a pretend restaurant.  with menus...  and waiters and customers.  oh, and of course, we'll need a chefthat's who cooks the food.  i want to be the chef.  me, too.  no, me.  what about me.  hmm, it looks like everyone wants to be a chef today.  i'm not sure how that's going to work.  we could end up with a real mishmash.  barney: i think we have everything we need.  : oh.  . i was standing in the kitchen talking to my friends .  . and we decided to make a special soup .  . it would be real different .  . 'cause it would have something from each food group .  all: . and we're gonna call it mishmash soup .  . and we don't know how it's gonna taste .  . it's gonna look a little weird .  . and seem a little strange .  . but we won't let it go to waste .  . so, in goes some bread .  . and then a little milk .  . now don't forget some fish .  . and the fruits and the veggies that we put in next .  . will make it a very special dish .  all: . and we're gonna call it mishmash soup .  . and we don't know how it's gonna taste .  . it's gonna look a little weird .  . and seem a little strange .  . but we won't let it go to waste .  . no, we won't let it go to waste. .  see, a few more things.  here's another fish.  and another.  plus this one.  and this one.  and i think it's ready now.  uh, who are we going to serve this to.  yeah, if everyone is the chef...  there's nobody to eat the food.  uhoh, we don't have any customers in our restaurant.   this is a little like what happened with the bongos, isn't it.  what do you mean, barney.  well, you all wanted to play the same instrument at the same time, and because of that, no one got to play any music.  that reminds me of what happened to the rabbit and the coyote and the moose and the bear.  all: what coyote. what moose.  what rabbit. what bear.  what are you talking about.  well, it's a very old story told by native americans called the kootenai people.  have a seat and i'll tell you the story.  yeah.  yeah.  great.  sounds like fun.  so, uh, comfy.  kids: yeah.  okay.  our story begins deep in a forest where there once lived a coyote.  one day, the coyote was taking a nap, when a bunny hurried by.  i wonder where bunny's going so fast.  uhoh, maybe there's a storm coming. i better go, too.    meanwhile, in another part of the forest, moose was doing his exercises, when suddenly...  where's bunny going so fast.  and why is coyote chasing after her.  oh, no, there must be a fire.  i better run, too.     not far from there, bear was fishing in a cool stream, when...  where's bunny going.  and why are coyote and moose with her.  there must be something terrible chasing them.  i better run, too.   before long, bear caught up with moose who was so tired he had to stop.  why are you running, moose.  : i was following coyote.  we'd better ask coyote what's wrong.  come on.  okay.   just ahead, they found coyote.  like moose, she'd gotten so tired, she just had to stop.  : why were you running, coyote.  when i saw bunny go by, i followed her.  we better ask bunny why she's running.  come on.    but they didn't find bunny until they got to her house.  well, hello, coyote and moose and bear.  what are you doing here.  we saw you running all through the forest.  so we ran, too.  is a storm coming.  is there a fire.  is something chasing us.  please tell us.  all: why were we running.   i don't know about you, but i needed to pick carrots out of my garden.   kids: great story, barney.  i liked it.  thanks, barney.  you're very welcome.  i can't believe all those animals chasing after the rabbit.  they weren't even thinking about what they were doing.  they were just chasing that silly rabbit for no reason.  kinda like what we were doing.  we all wanted to play the bongos like victor.  and we all wanted to be the chef, just because victor was.  we don't all need to do exactly the same thing, do we, barney.  no, you don't, nathan.  you can all do different things, because you're all different.  that's what makes you so special.   . you are special, you're the only one .  . you're the only one like you .  . there isn't another in the whole wide world .  . who can do the things you do .  all: .
