here we go.  whoa. whoa.  once upon a time, there were three pigs.  barney: there was a big pig...   ...a middle pig...   ...and a little pig.   one day, they went off to find homes of their own.  the big pig was a hard worker, but his brothers weren't.  they looked for the easy way to do things.  the little pig saw some straw and said, "i can make a house out of this. it'll be easy." big pig said, "well, it might be easy, but it won't stop a wolf." little pig only laughed...   ...and said, "big brother, you worry too much." and he quickly built his house of straw.  middle pig saw some sticks and said...   "i can build my house out of these. oh, it'll be easy." big pig said...   ..."oh, it might be easy, but it won't stop a wolf." middle pig only laughed...   ...and said, "big brother, you worry too much," and he quickly built his house of sticks.  big pig, who was a hard worker, found some bricks and began to build.  it wasn't easy and it took some time, but it was an amazing house.  just as they finished, along came big bad wolf.   "well," said little pig, "there goes the neighborhood." and the wolf said...  "little pigs, little pigs, let me in." "not by the hair of your chinnychin chin." said little pig.  "oh, you make me so mad." "i'm gonna to huff and i'm gonna to puff, and i'm gonna to blow your house down."  ooh...  barney: away went the house, and little pig ran as fast as he could.  let's run with him.  all right. come on. here we go.   all:  rigajigjig and away we go    away we go, away we go    rigajigjig and away we go    hiho, hiho, hiho.    hiho, hiho, hiho, hiho, hiho, hiho, hiho, hiho    rigajigjig and away we go.    hiho, hiho, hiho.    little pig ran to find middle pig, who lived in the house of sticks.  "little pigs, little pigs, let me in." barney: said the wolf.  both: "not by the hair of your chinnychin chin." barney: said the pigs.  "then i'm gonna huff, and i'm gonna puff "and i'm gonna blow this house down, too.  it'll be easy.  audience: ooh...   barney: away went the house, and away went the pigs.  let's run with them.  come on. here we go again.  all:  rigajigjig and away we go    away we go, away we go    rigajigjig and away we go    hiho, hiho, hiho.    hiho, hiho, hiho, hiho, hiho, hiho, hiho, hiho    rigajigjig and away we go.    hiho, hiho, hiho.    oh, very good.   rigajigjig, whoo.   they ran to big pig, who lived in the house of bricks.  "little pigs, little pigs, let me in." barney: said the wolf.  all: "not by the hair of your chinnychin chin." barney said the pigs.  "i'm gonna to huff and puff, and blow your house down."  "i said i'll huff, and i'll puff, and i'll blow your house down."   dear me, this isn't easy.  maybe you can help me huff and puff.  come on.      barney: but no matter how he huffed and how he puffed, the wolf couldn't blow down the house of bricks.  "oh, my head hurts." barney: the big bad wolf couldn't huff or puff anymore, so he ran away home.  well, byebye.   the two little pigs thanked their big brother.   barney: they learned it's not always good to take the easy way out, and with some hard work, you can do amazing things.  all right.  terrific.  bye. bye. bye.  barney: okay, see you soon.  byebye now.  oh, man.  that was awesomeespecially with riff making that great music.  yeah, you were wonderful.  i was kind of worried it wouldn't be good enough.  oh, we always knew it would be.  because you made it.  riff: oh, thanks.  when you do something that comes from your heart, it's always going to be special.  you know, you're right, barney.  yes, you are. you really are.  so, uh, what show are we going to do next.  oh, i don't know, what do you want to do, riff.  bye, barney. byebye. see ya.  byebye.  it's always fun to work together.  when we do special things to help our friends, it's a very nice way to say "i love you."  i love you    you love me    we're a happy family    with a great big hug    and a kiss from me to you    won't you say you love me, too.       i love you    you love me    we're best friends    like friends should be    with a great big hug    and a kiss from me to you    won't you say you love me, too.   captioned by media access group at wgbh access.wgbh.org  kids: let's play with barney.  hello again to all my friends.  i'm glad you're here today.  there's lots to do when i'm with you.  let's have fun and play.  it's time to go swimming.  wow. you can swim on top of the water...  or hold your breath and blow bubbles while swimming underneath.   oh, hi.  don't forget to go down the slide.  swimming is fun.  thanks for playing.  i love you.  know.  i know my telephone number.  a caterpillar becomes a butterfly when it grows up.  i know my sister loves me.  what do you know. hmmmm...  sounds make...   mooo.    meow...meow.   hooheehee.   quackquackquack.  what sounds can you make.   love.  i love rainbows.  grapes. pizza.  horses.  i love my dog, tippy.  what do you love.  something do.  i can hop like a kangaroo.  boing...boing...boing.  i can ride a carousel.  i can do the splits.  what can you do.  )
