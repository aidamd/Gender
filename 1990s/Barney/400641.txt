hi, bj. hi, amy.  look what we made.  what a great kite.  now all we need is a place to fly it.  well, you chose a good day.  there's a nice breeze blowing throughout the whole park.  come on. let's find the perfect spot.  okay. okay.  oh, boy.  flying kites can be so much fun.  the wind blows them up so high in the sky and spins them 'round and 'round.  whoa.  have you ever flown a kite.   flying so high with its tail in the breeze    up in the air with the greatest of ease    flipping and dipping with colors so bright    i love to fly my kite    whirling, twirling, high in the air    whirling, twirling, floating up there    at the end of the string, it's a wonderful thing    i love to fly my kite    look at it flutter and dance all around    hear the wind blowing it high off the ground    feel the string tugging, but just hold on tight    and you can fly a kite    whirling, twirling, high in the air    whirling, twirling, floating up there    at the end of the string    it's a wonderful thing    i love to fly my kite.   aw, come on, sissy.  but i was here first.  what's seems to be the problem.  bj wants me to move my lemonade stand.  but this is the perfect place to fly our kite, barney.  there's a nice breeze here.  well, yes, that is true.  but i like it because it's in the pretty sunlight.  and that's certainly true, too.  but the sun shines all the time.  it's not always windy like today.  yeah, well... i was here first.  sissy.  you know, this reminds me of a story.  what's that, barney.  it's all about the wind and the sun and the things they learned one summer day...  now, the wind and the sun had known each other for years and years.  i am the sun.  i shine my light across the land and warm everything i see.  i am the wind.  i blow leaves in the trees and kites fly in my breeze.  the wind and the sun were the very best of friends.  and always got along quite well.   hello, sun, sun, the day's begun    when you shine bright, we have fun    the sun is warm. the sun makes light    when the sun goes down, it's time to say good night    fun, fun, for everyone    it's a happy day when we're playin' in the sun    fun, fun, for everyone    it's a happy day when we're playin' in the sun   oh, yes, it is.   hello, wind, wind, you blow and spin    you ruffle our hair and tickle our skin    the wind zips around through the grass and trees    it can be a big storm or just a little breeze    whoosh. whoosh. twist and spin    we'll all have fun when we're blowin' in the wind    whoosh. whoosh. twist and spin    we'll all have fun when we're blowin' in the wind    fun, fun, for everyone    it's a happy day when we're playin' in the sun    whoosh. whoosh. twist and spin    we'll all have fun when we're blowin' in the wind.   whoa.  whoa.  whoosh, whoosh, whoosh.  but then one day, the wind was feeling in a sort of boastful, blustery mood.  look at mei can even blow clouds from the sky.  now, as it happened, a traveler came walking along on the road below.  the wind saw him and said...  i can make anyone do anything i want.  i can even make that man take off his coat.  whoa, what a windy day it is.  just watch this.  i'll blow that coat right off him.  barney: but the harder the wind blew...  the tighter the man held on to his coat.  i can't believe it.  i couldn't make him take off his coat.  and the sun said...  let me try.  and the wind just laughed.  if i can't make him do it, there's no way you can.  but instead of trying to make the man take off his coat, the sun asked nicely, in her own special way.  i'll shine my warm rays on him.  please take off your coat. please take off your coat.  whoa.  what a nice and warm day it is.  i don't need my coat anymore.  oh, looky. he's taking off his coat.  yeah.  all right, sun, you win.  and the wind learned it's always better to ask nicely.  the end.  thank you, barney.  that was a very good story.  you're very welcome.  you know, i just realized something.  you shouldn't try to make somebody do something.  you should ask nicely.  that's very true.  sissy, would you please move your stand over just a little so i can fly my kite here.  well, sure.  thanks.  let it fly on the wind, bj.  okay... here goes.  whoa. look at it go.  whoa.  look at it go.  thanks for sharing your space with me, sissy.  you're welcome, bj.  sharing is always the best way for everyone to have fun together.   the more we share together, together, together    the more we share together, the happier we'll be    'cause your friends are my friends    and my friends are your friends    the more we share together, the happier we'll be.   can you hand me the green one.   the more we share together, together, together    the more we share together the happier we'll be    'cause your friends are my friends    and my friends are your friends    the more we share together, the happier we'll be    the more we share together, together, together    the more we share together, the happier we'll be    'cause your friends are my friends    and my friends are your friends    the more we share together the happier we'll be.   oh boy, flying this kite sure makes me thirsty.  well, how about some lemonade.  that'd be great. thanks.  i'm glad bj and baby bop are getting along so nicely now.  and i'm glad you were here to share this time with us.   i'm so happy you're the one that's here today having fun    wherever we go, whatever we do    it's better with a friend like you    everything's better with a friend    everything's better with a friend like you
