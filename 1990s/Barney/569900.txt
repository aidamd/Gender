now...  pistachio pizza...  pistachio popovers...  pickled peppercorn pistachio puffs... my.  are you ready, barney.  the show's about to start.  oh, what show is that, riff.  oh, a really special one.  i think you're going to like it.  come on, let's go.  okay.  oh, i just love shows.  it's a little story called "the popcorn pot." bj: once upon a time long, long ago a poor family was kind to a fairyand so she gave them a wonderful popcorn pot and magic words for "go" and magic words for "stop" they said...  all: go, pot, go.  and it started to pop.  yummy popcorn filled the pot right up to the top.  they said...  all: stop, pot, stop.  ...when there was enough.  then they put the pot away with their other stuff.  but one little child wanted much more, ...  until fluffy popcorn was all about.  "oh, no, no. no more." said the girl.  "haven't you heard." but the pot didn't stop.  those weren't the right words.  "oh, halt." said the girl.  "cut it out. no. no." but the popcorn kept popping right up to her toes.  and just when the popcorn rose up to her shin, the rest of her family hurried in.  "stop, pot, stop." they all said with a shout.  and, since those were the words, oh, no more popcorn came out.  the girl said, "oh, i'm sorry.  and i have to confess, too much of a good thing is a very big mess." the end.  byebye.  goodbye.  you know, your show really made me think.  i can make pistachio popcorn.  i'd love that.  ayyiyi.  but, barney, you were supposed to think you should stop eating pashpishios.  but why.  i don't eat that many.  oh.  yeah. forgot about those.  uhhuh.  maybe i have been eating too many.  maybe i've made a big mistake.   oh. oh. oh.  what a big mistake    no. no. no. look.  my knees have started to shake    whoa. whoa. whoa.  this is more than i can take    oh. oh. oh.  what a big mistake.    i thought things were going okay    but they turned out wrong    and i hope everything works out before too long    but, until they do, i'm going to sing this song    oh. oh. oh.  what a big mistake.   boy.   so. so. so.  you made a big mistake.    no. no. no. you don't need to shiver and shake    all you need to know, for goodness' sake    is that you can learn    i can learn    yes, i can learn from my mistakes.   you're right.  i'll stop eating pistachios for a while.   but what am i going to do with all these.  well, i have an idea.  we can put them in jars and make maracas.  bj: oh.  barney: there you go.  and we can feed the rest to the squirrels.  they're nuts about nuts.   they sure are.  oh, thank you all.  now i see.  sometimes too much of anything is... too much, but there's one thing i can't get enough of.  oh, what's that, barney.   friends like you.  aw...   i'm so happy you're the one    that's here today    having fun    wherever we go, whatever we do    it's better with a friend like you   barney, bj, baby bop &
