the future to show you how it's done.  it's booster gold.  lights on.   as you can see,the booster gold brand is highly marketable.  and for the right price, i'd be willing to workwith you guys on an action figure toy line.  you're really a herofrom the future.  that's a fact.   i created this flight suit and a time travel device to come here.  i'm sorry, we just can't sell a toy line around you, ..  booster.  and have i mentioned my trusty robot sidekick here, skeets, can transform into a giant insect.  no, no, no, wait. a dinosaur.  you don't need a sidekick, you need name recognition.  maybe if you teamed up with an alist hero, someone like batman.  just a sec.  hey, hey, big blue.  how's the cape hanging.  what. no, i'm in a meeting.  how about you try to handle this one on your own.  not buying it, huh.  wait, you haven't even seen the booster mobile.  gold.  like booster gold.  ha ha ha. get it.  aah.  ooh.  skeets, old buddy, you know what i got to do.  i know what you should do, sir.  i gotta team up with batman.  or that.    sorry, punch and judy.  ahh. uhh.  but you'll find there won't be much to laugh about behind prison bars.  nice takedown, buddy.  bet that'll get us a front page mention.  o whyoe ar who are you.  your new partner.   here's the pitch.  the brave and the gold featuring booster and bats.  the ultimate teamup.  what do you think.  yeah, i love it, too.  you're that guy who uses his knowledge of the future to fight crime and make a quick buck.  i'd never team up with someone in this for the glory.  in this for the glory.  that hurts.  just a sec.  hi. great look.  the media loves that whole jester theme, and i've been thinking an archenemy would really raise my profile.  when you get out, let's talk.  ..     what kind of crime we busting tonight, partner.  trespassing.  how did you track me here.  in the 25th century, the batcave's a historical attraction.  with a roller coaster.  in 400 years or so, i'm gonna hurk right up there.  what's this.   i've been tracking missing quantities of lutonium and a recent scientific discovery that's gone missing.  wow, the stolen greenland meteorite.  looks like a certain immortal caveman has risen again to conquer the world.  you know, sir, that immortal caveman.  krull the eternal.  oh, yeah, the immortal caveman guy.  you should go.  wait, i know him.  krull's still around in the future.  i've even clashed with him once or twice.  excuse me.   please, you've got to let me in on this.  not unless you have a way to track lutonic energy in all that 25th century gear.  i run on a lutonium power cell, sir, and can scan for other sources.  ok.  but you're not going to turn this into a marketing opportunity.  just a sec.  manny, my man, line up a book deal and a movie, and we'll spin off the toy line from there.  i'm in with bats.    nothing.  i need still more lutonium to bring this rock back to life.  bending legitimate scientific equipment to your evil will.  you fiend.  batman.  and booster gold, hero from the 25th century.  that meteorite belongs to the public.  the rock is mine.  i found it 10,000 years ago, and i won't part with it again.  aah.   uhh.   once i find the lutonic energy i need, i will be unstoppable.  you're out of luck, krull.  huh.   it's hero time, skeets.  make sure you get a photo.   aah.  uhh.    a super collider is one aspect of particle physics that even a caveman can enjoy.  smashing things against a wall.   before i kill you, booster gold, man of the future, tell me, does the world prosper under my rule.  huh.   way to keep the supervillain talking, sir.  aah.      stay alert.    .    whoa. whoa. whoa.  don't let a hungry tummymess you up.   fill it upwith the good stuff.  lunchables,extra cheesy pizza.  soft wholegrain crust,100% real fruit juice.  lunchables.  lunch your tummy right.  .   dogto or beg for a closetfull of handmedowns.  ..  or a drill instructorfor a gym teacher.  but at subway restaurants, you get exactly whatyou ask for.  subway.eat fresh.   and now for you, batman.  you i'm going to have stuffed and mounted in my den.  not in your lifetime.  uhh. ooh.  sir, we're gonna smash so hard we'll explode into plasma.  but i may be able to overload the magnetic field and blast us free.   uhh.  sequence initiated.  aah.  oof. ooh.  ahh.   you broke the magnetic field.  the power you'd need is unthinkable.  skeets runs on a genuine 25th century lutonium battery.   no, there isn't.  he took skeets.  and the meteorite.  we gotta save him, bats.  skeets is my best bud, my wingman.  the only one i've ever right now he's counting on you, booster.  we all know i'm not much of a hero.  maybe you've just never had anything worth fighting for until now.   soon, my loyal servants, you will be my eternity warriors, immortal as i am, and just as powerful.  sir, i feel compelled to warn you that booster gold will be here at any moment to foil your villainous plot.  i'm afraid nothing can stop this final evolution of a simple caveman, one that began all those generations ago when a magic rock fell from the sky.  it bathed me in mysterious rays.  a simple chromagnum becomes a super warrior.  modern man wiped out my kind, t t me no .but met i would not me i was krull the eternal.  yet i outlive whatever i conquer.  my people always die out, leaving me alone.  or they did until scientists rediscovered my magic rock in greenland.  i vow to create a race of superhumans to fight by my side.  but to do that the meteorite requires a massive jolt of lutonic energy.  yes.  and once we combine these treasures from future and past, krull the eternal will rule all.  aah.   ..  the boy who was raised by bees.  he says he likeshoneycomb cereal because it has a honeycrunch big enough for a bee.  you're not a bee,bernard. you're a boy.  bzz.  big honey bite. big honey taste.  honeycomb cereal. part ofthis complete breakfast.   we'll enlist the crime fighters best ally, the element of surprise.  ouch.   sorry.   now the moment of my greatest triumph is at hand.  krull is brilliant.  skeets.  intruders.  ooh.   just like the aztec warriors, there is no quitting you.   but they, too, eventually fell before me.  the guillotine.  retro. i dig it.  but, dude, we shouldn't be enemies.  we should be partners.  you want an empire.  i can help you build it.  radio, print, tv, and the internet.  toy line, hello.  do you ever stop.  and we'll split it 50/50.  whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. 60/40.  if you are the quality of hero the future has to offer, then i shall have no problem keeping the world under my boot heel.  i knew the booster mobile was good for something.  you broke my buddy.  i'm gonna break you.   huh.    sweetie, they're winning.  not for long.    ahh.   uhh.   yah.  ahh.    huh.    yikes.   aah.  ahh.   ooh.  uhh.  ahh.  aah.  ugh.    huh.  huh.  oof.   uhh. uhh.  uhh.  ooh.   ahh.  ahh.  ohh.  ahh. uhh.     once a caveman, always a caveman.  it always comes down to bashing something with a rock.  i'll crush you for that.   brains trump brute force, krull.   uhh.  brute force.  wait a second.  uhh.  skeets. uhh.  dump your charge out.  but, sir, i've been holding back.  trust me. uhh.     what happened.  am i gonna live forever.  you diluted creature, still hoping to get something for nothing.  skeets.  speak to me, buddy.  i knew you would save me, sir.  i don't know what i'd do without you.  'cause, you know, i need to make some calls and this ear bud's got, like, zero bars.  i'm on it, sir.  you'll get life for this.   your prison will be dust long before krull the eternal is.  i'm glad we could work together, booster.  wow.  my thoughts exactly.  and there's a lesson to be learned.  you were a hero because you ignored the glory and remembered what mattered most wasjust a sec.  manny, call the toy company.  i teamed up with batman, and guess what.  we won.  i know.  huh.  news crews.  what do you mean there has to be a camera.  stupid 21st century media.  until we meet again, booster gold.  uhh.   wait, you remind me of somebody i met years and years ago.  just a sec.  second floor's almost clear.  yeah, tell me that when i'm famous.  you.  captioni animation captioned by the nationalcaptioning institute www.ncicap.org )
