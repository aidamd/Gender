 but after saving paris from the super terrorist general zahl, the doom patrol vanished, at the height of their fame.  what could have driven these controversial heroes to relinquish their duties as guardians of mankind.  hasn't my doom patroldone enough, sacrificed enough.  why must they continueto hound us.  selfpity,niles caulder.  how unlike you.  getting a tad soft in your old age, aren't you.  there is no doom patrol, brain.  no reason for us to fight.  au contraire.  with your protectors gone, this is the perfect time to fight, and the perfect time to die.  now, monsieur mallah.   oh, what is wrong with you, caulder.  lost your lust for battle.  this criminal coup de main ends now.  batman.   aah.  it is too late for you, caulder.  your beloved patrol is doomed.   that's not a threat we can take lightly, old friend.  the others have to be warned.  yes, but we've got to find them first.  oh, osmond. we're out of tortilla chips.  be a darling and bring out some more, would you. ugh.      fear the might of the mutant master.  oh, it's just you 3.  don't you have anything better to do.  shoo. go away and rob a bank or something.    what.  you dare to ignore the mutant master.  absolutely.   aah.    aah.  chief. aah.      a little help would be appreciated, elastigirl.  i'm retired.  after what happened in paris, i'm done.  doom patrol is being targeted.  we need you.       rita, you're a hero, not some overfed, selfindulgent baby.  these people are in danger, so pull yourself together.      aah. oof.  it seems pointless for us to fight our destiny.  welcome back, rita.  ..  but that doesn't mean i have to like it.  step right up, folks, and see that astonishing freak of nature, the one and only amazing negative man.     go back where you came from.  yeah, that's right. let him have it.  i've had it with this dump, with you and these brain dead yahoos.  get yourself another monkey. i'm out of here.  don't leave just yet, larry.  the show's just beginning.    lright.  the tomb of the greedyfroot pharaoh.  i gotta tastethe fruity riches.  woah.  they're monumentally colorful.   uh oh.  that'smydelicious breakfast.  it's yummyin a mummy's tummy. run.     waaaooooohhhhh.  this should straighten things out.   kellogg's froot loops cereal: the yumfully coloricious part of this balanced breakfast.    for the fruity taste that shows.    barnum is that.  ..  animalvegetablemineral man.  i love it. does he have an agent.       without your energy body, you're nothing.           and for me, they throw tomatoes.  trainor, your teammates need you now, so lose the negative attitude.  isomeone's targeted the doom patrol, and they're using your deadliest foes as weapons.  this is no time for navelgazing.  but i'mlook around you, man.  how could a hero of your abilities be reduced to this.  where's your selfrespect.  shut up already.  for crying out loud, after a few months in this dump, i'm way past ready to get out.  good. i'm glad our little chat helped.  come on. we have to find robot man.  batman, the motive behind these attacks seems clear.  someone wants the doom patrol reunited, but who.  stupid hunk of junk.  you go all to pieces, but i barely got a scratch.  life just ain't fair.  give me another one to test.  we're, uh, knocking off for lunch, mr.  steele.  lunch. look, halfwit.   maybe you need to eat, but not me.  i don't need no food, no sleep, no nothing.  in case you haven't noticed, i ain't a man anymore.  i'm a stinking robot.   hey, you mind.  the arsenal.  come on, steele. fight. defend yourself.  where's the fun in destroying you if there's no challenge. fight.  maybe i ain't got any fight left in me.  maybe this is what i want.  hands off the tin man.  ..  but he's our obnoxious antisocial jerk.   aah.  what are you bozos doing here.  i don't need your stinking help.  right, because you were doing so well without us.   aah.  now this is a challenge.  aah.  oh. aah.   aw, crud.  figures it's always me who has to save your sorry butts.  like it or not, these losers are the closest things to friends i've got in this stinking world, and i ain't going to let you hurt 'em.   aah.  well done, my doom patrol. well done.  guess we've still got it.  he'sright here.  you stayed out of the fight intentionally.  figured if robot man saw his teammates in danger, he'd snap out of his funk.  you're a pretty lousy psychiatrist if you think this is all it will take to get me back with the patrol.  so i wasn't going to stand there and let them die.  but i meant what i saidi'm finished. do you hear me. finished.   you are, indeed.  general zahl.  aah. ohh.    huh.   the doom patrol was already finished, so why would youshock them out of their stupor and force them back together.  so i can reveal to the world the doom patrol as they truly arefrauds and cowards.  no, zahl. they're heroes.  ahh, yes.  you find pleasure in playing the role of heroic saviors.  feeding off the adoration of the masses.  but you can't cover up what happened in paris forever.  yes, chief.  tell batman what happened there.  it was several years ago.  zahl was on the verge of his greatest victory.  half of france was on its knees, till my doom patrol arrived.  then zahl took things to another level snatched an innocent woman out of the crowd, told us that if we didn't surrender, ..  what could we do.  if we complied, zahl would be free, and thousands, perhaps millions of lives, would be lost.   france was saved, but the fate of that hostage haunted us, ate away at the team until we began to argue, even more than usual.  that terrible tragedy destroyed the doom patrol.  and so, we went our separate ways.  but now, i will show the world that the great doom patrol values themselves above the adoring masses that they supposedly protect.  that entire island has been seeded with powerful explosives.  a simple push of this plunger, and it will be consumed.  extinguishing the doom patrol forever.  and that's your grand vision.  you see, there is another island several miles west of here.  14 worthless gnats.  sickeningly average, pathetically ordinary.  that island, too, is rigged to explode.  and i leave it to you and your comrades, caulder, to decide their fate.  say the word, and i destroy them.  ..  well, i'm sure you get the point.  just to make things even more interesting, your every word and action is being broadcast across the planet.  today, all mankind will learn what the doom patrol really isyou have 2 minutes, caulder. make your choice.  and now, batman, i..  houdini didn't need a utility belt to escape a trap, and neither do i.  and now, zahl, i'll take those detonators.   the decision, my doom patrol, lies with you.  well, chief, you taught us that all men are our brothers.   the pilgrims were just ordinary men and women, too, but they longed for freedom and were willing to fight for it.   and the people who wouldn't bow to the pharaoh, they were just ordinary shepherds and farmers.  i guess you have your answer, general.  all: fire away.  so be it.    it's over, general.  not quite.  the real detonator is here.  no.   we're all the doom patrol.  we're all the doom patrol.  all: we're all the doom patrol.  we're all the doom patrol.  we're all the doom patrol.  we're all the doom patrol.  we're all the doom patrol.  we're all the doom patrol.  we're all the doom patrol.  no. no. how can it be.  the world loves them even more.  even in death, they've beaten me.  batman: rest well, heroes.  rest well.    argit:   whatever you're selling, we don't want any.   argit: you got arealnice castle here.  it'd be a shame if anything happenedto it.   what are you talking about.   argit: your home.  your hearth.  your cache of priceless alien technology.   if you know about that, you also know that the forever knights are not to be trifled with.   argit: i'd never trifle with you guys.  in fact, i'm here to help.  i'm selling insurance piece )
