 even the dinosaurs don't get a museum this big.  this is just gotham's way of saying anks.  without batman, the world would be a much darker place.  who knows, someday you may end up in this museum, damian.  heh. intimidating much, dad.  could i finish junior high before you put a cape on me.  if this museum shows me anything, it's that the world will always need a batman.  but what if i want to be a scientist.  crime fighting is a science.  what about a race car driver.  the batmobile is the fastest car on the planet.  astronaut.  the galaxy is just another neighborhood to patrol for a crime fighter.  isn't that what green lantern told you that time.  cut it out, dad.  don't map out my life for me, ok.  damian, why don't you go check out the hall of holyisms.  it's corny, but it's kind of cool.  he gets that attitude from you.  but he has your heart, bruce.  you know how proud is he of you, of all of this.  but he's young.  he needs to figure things out for himself without us pushing him.    mom. dad.  damian, over here.  since the old man bit the soft shoe off this mortal coil years ago, it's only fitting that i crash the party in his place.  ..  i am the joker's son.       daddy's sledgehammer in here.  heresy.  ahh.  the joker has a son.  you mean someone had kids with that guy.  impossible.  this is just a sick, shameless charlatan.  i'm gonna make this city forget batman if i have to conk every gullible gothamnite on the noggin one by one.   uhh.  got quite an arm on you, mr. wayne.   think i'll use it to beat you to death with.   aah.  ooh.  brandnew joke, same old punch line.  grr.  uhh.   i was only supposed to trash the place, but looks like you're going to be the booby prize, old man.   ahh.  ooh.  hands off the merchandise.  no spawn of a rodeo clown is going to squash my husband.  i forgot how cute you are when you're threatening.    this guy's crazy.  what are we gonna do.  here, gives these a try.  it'll be good practice.  dad, i told you, i'm not ready.  i stilllook out.   just a gas grenade, damian.  you've got a whole 3 seconds to throw it back before it goes off.   uhh.  you think trashing a museum is going to ruin batman's legacy.  i won't let you do that.   uhh.  you and what army, old man.  uhh.  actually, that army would be me.  we haven't met, junior.  i'm batman.  well, now that the guest of honor has arrived, it's time to bring down the house.  ahh.   ooh.  ahh.  uhh.  ahh.   no.  ahh.  oof.  ahh.  guess it's true what they say.  all comedy comes from tragedy.  till next time, batman.   batman, hurry. we've got to save them.  damian, come on.  no.  and so calamity struck the wayne family once again.  and while gotham was left without its most esteemed citizen and the world its bravest hero, it was a young boy who would bear the greatest loss.   i've got a lead on where that monster's gonna strike next, damian.  if i had been the son they wanted me to be, maybe i could have done something.  maybe i could have saved them.  some things are just destined to happen.  for some people, tragedy is inevitable.  but tragedy made bruce wayne the man he was.  it made me who i am.  if i can live up to the batman legacy, dick.  i don't know if i want to.  if i mess up, people get hurt.  your dad taught you everything you need to know to protect yourself and others.  you just have to believe in yourself enough to use that knowledge.  remember, damian, there's more to the batman legacy than being batman.  i should know.  are you going to stop him.  i'm going to make sure joker never hurts anyone again.   is that the joker.   laugh it up all you can, junior.  because you won't have anything to smile about when i put your butt in arkham.  uhh.   well, batman, i was wondering when you'd show up.  shame about the waynes, seeing as it was your building that fell on them and all.  ugh.   ohh.  uhh.  aah. oof.  you've crossed the line, madman.  ooh. "crossed the line".   i haven't even gotten warm yet.  that's enough joker gas to blanket the city.  we felt the best way to dishonor batman would be to replace the citizen's memories of him with a smile.  we.    batman, you look shocked to see me.    surprised to see me, batman.  or should i say nightwing.  oh, how'd i know.  i'm crazy, not stupid, remember.  but now that bruce wayne's gone, you'll have to do.  you're supposed to be dead.  how'd youoh, who cares.  i've been blown up, dropped down smokestacks, fed to sharks.  i'm the joker, i always survive.  only this time, the joke was on me.  my doc recently gave me the bad news.  seems all those chemicals i've exposed myself to over the years finally took their toll.  i gave him 6 seconds.    so you needed a son to do your dirty work.  a nobody with nothing to live for and nothing to lose.  he gladly let me make him over in my image.  batman's not the only one with fans, you know.  so you killed the waynes in the name of destroying batman's legacy.  i figured the old man would just keep passing the torch down.  and if i'm ever going to get the last laugh, i need to snuff it out.  and tonight, it ends with youthe last of the batmen.  my life's work is coming to an end.  batman is an ideal, not a person.  he can't die.  we'll see about that.  goodbye, new batman.  say hello to the real one when you see him.   guess you missed the announcement, joker.  there's a new robin in town, too.   well, aren't you precious.  damian.  you were right.  it's time i lived up to the legacy.  so what do i do now.  keep them busy while i get to the gas.  hey, new meat. get him.   uhh. uhh.  and they call me crazy.  you think putting on a robin costume makes you a hero.  i was born for this.  oh, look at them go.  reminds me of old times.   you know, i tried training a lot of apprentices, but it's hard to find someone who can survive the rigors of being completely insane.    come on, i've had punch lines that hit harder than you.  uhh.   huh.  uhh.   i am my father's son.  uhh.  now it's getting good, don't you think, batmayou're not going anywhere.  we all go down together.  aah.  uhh. ohh.   the show can't go on without batman.  let's get out of here.  rule one, good super villains never leave the heroes alive, dummy.  uhh.  rule 2, countdown clocks are for hacks.     let chaos reign.     aw.   this can't be good.    ohh.   what happened.  well, your dad would say joker was hoisted by his own petard.  good job, kid.  you think you're gonna stick with it.  gotham needs a batman and batman needs a robin.  ..  and proved that his father lived on through him.  he accepted his place as heir to the cowl.  ready to pound some criminal scum, robin.  holy hammers of justice, dad.  i mean, batman.  let's go get 'em.   up late writing another of your detective stories, alfred.  a flight of fancy, sir.  catwoman is planning another felinerelated felony.  that explains why your batsuit looks so nicely pressed.  wayne some day.  the only rings i'm putting on her are the batcuffs.  of course, sir.  animation captioned by the national captioning institute www.ncicap.org  come on out, trukk.  your 30 days are up.  time to get back to work.   welcome back, trukk.  been quiet around here without you.   no talking. work.   so, i hear there's been some changes while i was in solitary.  some new guy in the chain gang.   yeah.   show him to me.  i'm gonna need to hurt him some, just so he knows who's in charge around here.   uh, don't think you really want to do that.   yeah. why not.  ..  that'sthe guy.   ben: big waste of time, gwen.  there's nothing we can do.   gwen: kevin's been missing for over a week.   ben: not missing.  he left us hischoice. )
