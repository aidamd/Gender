 tuftan's in trouble.  kamandi, no.  you'll jeopardize our mission.     get away from him, you big ape.   tuftan. tuftan.   come on. this is no place for us.   tuftan, no.   reinforce the right flank.    no. i did not order a retreat.  cowards.   congratulations, great caesar.  once again, you've routed the ape filth and won the day.  but i fear i've lost my son.  he's shown where his loyalties lie.  you're all cowards.  the tiger empire would be broken by now if i had an army of true warriors instead of you worthlessno. you are the reason for our defeat today.  you are a disgrace to all apekind, general.   who are you.  who dares speak to me this way.  i dogorilla grodd.  professor nichols.   i didn't want to do it.  hehe forced me to.  grodd.  i've been tracking him since his escape, and the trail ends here.  that frightful beast burst into my lab.  he knew about my temporal experiments and used my time ray to send himself into the future.  then i need you to send me after him.  this beacon will allow the time ray to find you in the time stream and return you to the present.  in other words, don't lose it.  good luck, batman.   grodd. heh.  your name means nothing to me.  soldiers, teach this fool some respect.     such technology.  i challenge you for command of this army, general.  no weapons.  the challenge is a test of strength.  as it should be.      you are beaten.  we will follow you, general grodd.   under my leadership, we will show the world the true meaning of gorilla warfare.   these wild humans will make poor slaves.  there's barely any meat on their bones.    it's that humanloving deserter and his pet.  get them.   run. you're free.  doggie.  stop him.      unh.  batman.  looks like you could use a hand.  good to see you again.  but why would you ever want to come back here.  one of the most diabolical villains of the 21st century is loose in your time.  as if we don't have enough to worry about.   cease.  surrender, or the slaves and your humanloving friends die.   great caesar will pay a handsome price for you.      tq   these cookies are fi  i'm not here.  aahhhh.   eieieieieieieieieieieieieieieither.  eieieieieieieieieieieieither.  eieieieieieieieieieieieieieieither .  susan:  i think you shou do they have a lot of sugar in 'em.  tons.  han dirt.  ooh. ah. gah.  ooh. ah. gah.  >>v  you've caused me a lot of trouble, kamandi.  this is the end for you.  and you, my soni can understand such treachery in them, but not from my own blood.  it is not treachery to fight for the rights of all species, father.  you are a traitor, not only to your species, but to your own family.  perhaps you'll see the error of your ways after a few years in the dungeon.  the rest of you are to be executed.  your people are in danger, great caesar.  let me help you.  it speaks, but makes no sense.  how can a lowly human be of service to the tiger empire.  a criminal madman from my era, gorilla grodd, has come to your world.  gorilla. heh.  we have nothing to fear from the gorillas.   what is that.  grodd.   tiger men.  your day is done.  this is the dawn of a new agethe age of the ape.   you must be grodd.  the apes may have a new leader, but to great caesar, you're still just a dirty monkey.  .   fire that sonic cannon.    cats have such sensitive ears.  tiny. smash the gate.  tiny. tiny. tiny.  tiny. tiny.   tiny. tiny.     into the city.  the only good tiger is a dead tiger.   they're inside the gates.   follow me.  i know the back alleys of this city like i know my own stripes.   batman. here.   get him.    we're outnumbered. quick, this way.    this pipe empties on the far side of the city.  they'll never see us.  i understand the need to retreat, batman, but what now.  with all his technological might, how can we defeat grodd.  you and kamandi, come with me.  tuftan, i have a special mission for you.  the mighty have fallen, great caesar.    we should be fighting, not running.  where are we.   home.  what a dump.  a magnificent archaeological find, batman.   who dares enter the bat cave.     you mock us with your costume, human.  you are no manbat.  kill the trespassers.   we need to com the tar monster scared the locals  when he gets nervous.  rorry.  hidi reah.  they're insisting that thes demands.  y inc. is currently investigating    you're gonna have a scooby s   mystery incorporated.   i just came back for some of my stuff.   marvelous. just marvelous.   i will feast on your blood and suck the marrow from your bones.  you're going hungry tonight.   get out of my cave.   now, tell us, batman, why you have brought us here.  grodd's using technology from the past to conquer your world.  we're going to level the playing field.    no further, grodd.  your conquest of our world ends here and now.   you amuse me, tiger cub, but your collection of rabble is no match for my mighty army.   we do not fear chimpanzees.  .   sonic cannons.    charge.     batman.  to fly through the air like an eagle.  yours was an age of wonders, batman.  i'm going to be sick. hang on.   no.  what are you doing. charge. charge.   this might be a bad time to ask, but, uh, how do we land this arial conveyance.   canus scream]  that should even the odds.  now let's show them what humans can do.   you fly as one of us.  we are with you, batman.    canus screaming]  tiny, finish them.      can you handle this.  depends. got any rope in that belt.  you have most unusual friends, kamandi.     following me through time, batman.  i'm beginning to think you have an unhealthy obsession with me.  my obsession is with justice, grodd.  come and get some.    did you say you had a plan to deal with this monster.  more of an idea than a plan.   plan, idea, do something.         no, you fools. i didn't order a retreat.  come back.    i owe you my thanks, humans.  perhaps there is more to your species than meets the eye.  and you, my son, i owe an apology.  you are no traitor to your peopleonly to our intolerant views towards humans.  free the slaves.  farewell, old man.  though i treasure our friendship, i hope you won't have to return here.  who knows, kid.  maybe next time, you'll be visiting me.  do you meankamandi. down, boy. down.  aw, nuts.  animation captioned by the nationalcaptioning institute www.ncicap.org        both:   zak:  what is with my powers lately.     drew: doc, see if you can lead it out to open sea.  we have to get it to its cave.   zak: mom, i've got this one.      zak: just back off.      zak:..  i think we just bought a boat.   drew: "we".    argost:     doc:..  ana asef.i'm sorry.  rest assured i'll pay for a new, uh,zibdeh.     doc:  why did i get stuck with publicrelations duty.   drew: because you read ancient sumerian even worse than you speak arabic.  you know you just offered to buy that guy some new butter.   doc: just hurry up with the search, all right.   zak: mom, this tablet we're ..   drew: it's called the epic of gilgamesh.   zak: okay, but  drew: it's an ancient sumerian record of the legendary warrior's battle with kur.  this is one of the possible resting places.  see, there was a regiment of roman troops garrisoned in this area during the punic wars.   zak: got it, but what i was trying to say is maybe some vikings took it.   drew: vikings.   zak: nasty.  i think that algerian sea centipede ate a longboat.   drew: yeah, it's a 150foot predatory arthropod.  it's got to get its calories from somewhere.     drew: how about we work on your power control with something smaller.  i got this one.  ugh, why does it always have to be stickyandsmelly.   fiskerton:  ew.   doc: well, yacht shopping wasn't my idea of a good time, either.   drew: uh, was anyone else eaten and regurgitated by a giant centipede.  then we are not comparing bad days, okay.   zak: sorry, mom.   drew: ugh.  not your fault, kiddo.  sorry this kur thing's throwing us all off our game.  anyway, at least we're one step closer to finding the epic of gilgamesh.  if the vikings were here, that means they could have taken the tablet.   doc: well, there's a 9th century trading site in greenland we could try, if you boys are in the mood for snow.   zak: sweet.  snowball fight rematch, fisk.   fiskerton:   komodo:   doc: autopilot's set.  let's get some rest.  who knows what giant bug your )
