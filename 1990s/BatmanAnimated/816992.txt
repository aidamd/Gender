recaptured the separatist planet and shut down its droid factories of doom.  an investigation by luminara unduli led to the discovery of queen karina the great, whose hivemind could reanimate dead geonosian soldiers.  during the destruction of the queen's temple, the jedi apprehended her advisor, poggle the lesser, and now prepare to deliver the villain to coruscant for trial.     i'm afraid we have a complication.   don't we always.   i've just received a distress signal from our forces on dantooine.  master windu's defenses held, but at a great cost to his men.  they need medical supplies immediately.  we can obtain these supplies at the medical station near ord cestus.   we're delivering poggle to coruscant, and cestus is not exactly on the way.   the republic must begin debriefing poggle right away if we're to get useful intelligence from him.   master, i suggest we let our padawans handle the supply mission.   whatever needs to be done, master.  i'm happy to help.   as am i.   very well.  take a medical frigate.  and after we've delivered poggle to coruscant, we'll rendezvous with you for the voyage to dantooine.         sorry, boys.  hope i didn't interrupt any pleasant dreams.   got another mission, sir.   you bet.  we're making a medical supply run to ord cestus.   ugh.  thought we were bred for battle, not running errands.   hey.  we were bred to follow orders, pulsar.  you got a problem with that.   no, sir. )
