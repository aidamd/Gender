'cause i'm seeing gorillas riding pterodactyls with harpoon guns stealing a boat.  it's gorilla grodd.  it's messed up, is what it is.   gorilla grodd, voiceover: you are under my control.  you cannot resist the power of my superior mind.  succumb to grodd.  bats. bats.  hey, snap out of it, bats.  batsy. bats. whoohoo.  bats. wake up, buddy.  bats.    a bit too easy for my taste.   dinosaur islanda mysterious land that exists outside of time where the normal laws of nature don't apply.  what makes you say that.  the dinosaur.   .  .. oooooh .  .  .. oooooh .  .  .. oooooh .  . ba da ba ba ba .   aah. oh.    hey. don't. stop it. oh. hey. aah.   eww.inosaur germs.   hang on, bats. i'm coming.   grab on.   man, this place is insane.  wish i had my camera.  you're not still mad about the money thing, are you.  aw, come on. give me another chance.  tell me one reason why i should.  because it's your fault i became plastic man in the first place.  you remember, don't you, bats.  i was a lowlife crook named eel o'brian working in kite man's gang.  but even i didn't deserve what happened that night.  jig's up, kite man.       those chemicals turned me into the freak i am today.  the only reason you ever help me is because you feel guilty.  there are no happy endings to a life of crime, o'brian.  you made your choice.  it's up to you to make the best of it.    grodd's hideout.   look at all those luxury yachts.  ..  and i bet it's all stashed in there.   we're here to stop whatever grodd has planned.  don't get any funny ideas.  oh, no. i'm cool. heh.  let's go. we're taking grodd down, hard.  not so fast.  grodd will have this whole valley wired with cameras, trip wires, and sensors.  they didn't call me the "eel" for nothing.  try to keep up, huh.  oh, yeah, the eel.      you're a long way from gorilla city, grodd.  dinosaur island's unique inhabitants will be the vanguard of a new civilization, a glorious gorilla nation, a utopia that will spread to claim the entire world.  my eray evolves humans into their ultimate expressionthe intelligent ape.  it only requires one more test, and i see 2 volunteers.  not interested.       don't bother with the mind control, grodd.  i'm blocking it with a technique i learned in tibet.         i am the superior being.  bats, no.    nice going, plas.  way to get one of your only friends in this lousy world captured.     kite man planned the whole thing, your honor.  take him away.  eel o'brian, why should this parole board show you leniency.  i give you my word.  i'll take full responsibility for o'brian's rehabilitation.  hang in there, bats.  i swear, i won't let you down again.    good.  you're awake.  you amuse me, batman.  you dress as an animal.  you battle against the worst of humanity, the vile underbelly that only wishes to destroy.  you should join my noble cause.  my only cause is to send you back to the zoo.   prepare the eray.   screeches] not going to let you down, bats.   on my way, pal.   just a slight delay, bats.   this is not happening.  humanity is an evolutionary dead enda species determined to destroy itself and take the rest of the planet with it.  my species represents the first of a new biological paradigm.  we have transcended the animal kingdom.  missed a spot.      why does this kind of stuff never happen to superman.  ..  hello.  in . stno
