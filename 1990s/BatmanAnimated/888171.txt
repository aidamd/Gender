thwarted by el paso's own blue beetle and aquaman.  that's not me, dear.  it's ocean guy.  similar color schemes.  oh. i couldn't help it, my queen.  the little blue guy needed a hand.  we're heroes. it's what we do.  uh.  ugh.  but a king, a father, must never go back on his word.  from this moment forward, no more heroics.  i am on vacation with my beloved family.   aah.  hmm.  huh.  uhh. uhh.  just think of the heroics that went into packing that much sod.  uhh.   it's that villain the sportsmaster.  ooh, looks like he's on vacation, too.    why, it's batman.  you'll never guess what, old chum.  i'm actually enjoying this family vacation.   you fell right into my trap, masked meddler.   and when the razorsharp beak of my drinking bird finishes you off, the gotham crime world will make

fiend.  release them at once or i'llsilence, you waterlogged whelp.  as i was explaining to batman, my umbrella drones will fan out over the city and spray in a paralytic gas to render all its denizens unconscious.  with one touch of this button, thousands of my umbrella rockets will launch from these tubes ..  it's my fault we're in this mess.  i've failed you both.  it's ok, dad.  maybe vacations aren't for people like us.  who needs them when you love your job.  and you do love your job.  almost as much as i love you.  i'm sorry, am i interrupting.  i wouldn't want to bother you

your wings permanently, batman.  huh.  uhh.  yah.    thanks for taking time from your vacation to lend a hand.  anytime, old chum.  i promised you a real family vacation.  and by poseidon, that's what i intend to give you.  now, who wants to see the stonehenge made from old refrigerators.  where's the fun in that.  i want to see you save the world again.  we'll call it "the time my dad saved the "
