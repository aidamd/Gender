 based on this triangulation, it's coming from star city.  the timing corresponds with an increase in small meteor strikes around the globe.  a strange signal from star city.  this all sounds really familiar.  ..   . listen, i'm pretty sure something big happens today.  huge, in fact.  go on.  details are a little fuzzy, but i think it involves a diaper truck.  ace.   now maybe we can find out what this all means.  no match in the database.   could mean it's alien in origin.  it's ..  lighting a path to this planet for my master.   unh.  uhh.   aah.  there is no weapon in your arsenal that i cannot counter.  then maybe i should use someone else's arsenal.      unh.    unh.  i have already subdued most of your allies.  soon there will be no heroes left to defend earth, and starro shall conquer it with ease.  today's the invasion.   oh. looks like you already figured it out.   unh.  tell your master that earth is off limits.  no, batman.  your planet will fall.  for the starro invasion has begun.      starro lives.  starro lives.  starro lives.  starro lives.  starro lives.  ..   ..  same chef boyardee ravioli, same gigantic ears.  that seems unnecessary.  all this time, you've sat in the comfort of that meaty ravioli while i was in the bush.  you outgrew me and left me under a bush five years ago.  and there ain't no ravioli out there, son.  just dirt.   mom.  chef boyardee micro beef ravioli.  the saucy, meaty taste you never outgrow.  lives.  starro lives.  starro lives.  ..  we're going to need an army of heroes.  yeah, but who's left that doesn't have a face full of starfish.  only one way to find out.  i modified my communicator so only those with uncompromised synaptic responders can receive the signal.  what, like a dog whistle. cool.  calling all heroes. calling all heroes.  calling all heroes.  this is batman.  if you can hear this signal, meet me at these coordinates.  the fate of the world is at stake.  so let me get this straight.  after scouring the globe, we got ourselves ..  hey. hey.  ..  science teacher.  ..what.  b'wana beast. how you doin'.  this is all that's left to fight the greatest threat to humanity ever.  yeah, and who are you supposed to be.  uh, booster gold, hero of the 25th century.  never heard of you.  listen up.  ..  ..  ..  eccentric.  but like it or not, we're earth's only hope for survival.  so suck it up. put on your game faces.  shazam.   firestorm. firestorm.  you must have one heck of a power to pull off that look.  allow me to demonstrate.  uh, let's see.  ..  ..you.    i am so gonna hurk.  that was awesome. do it again.  ahem.  our mission is simpledisable the signal in star city before this creature finds its way to earth.  ..  a kangaroo and a lizard. yep.  an earthworm and a rhinoceros. easy.  .. slightly smaller dog.  heh. do you really have to ask.  awesome.  we're all gonna die, aren't we.  pretty much, yeah.   there it isstarro's signal.   try not to hurt them.   hyah.  hyah.  unh.  aah.  holy moly.  aah.  unh. ahh.  can't you turn him into foam rubber.  still working on our transmutation power, remember.  well, if we don't do something quick, he's gonna transmute us into toast.   ohh.  ohh.  remember, sir, be gentle.  yeah, i'll try to rememberaah.  huh.  vixen, honey, it's meb'wanie, you're fiance.  starro lives.   unh.  this device has played its part.  my master's way is now clear.  goodbye, batman.  unh.  what have we here.  unh.  intriguing.  aah.   change of plans.  starro lives.  starro lives.  it's like a batterystoring the energy in order to pass it on to starro when he arrives.  i don't care how it works.  justjust find a way to take it off.  you have the audacity to deny starro.  then embrace your fate and kiss your loved ones a final goodbye.  .. for untold eons...  i have roamed the cosmos, conquering and devouring all who crossed my path.  those few who resisted my will eventually succumbed.   thus it has been and shall ever be.  and your planet, so rich with life, ..  intoxicating.  i will be there soon.  who will be here.  oh.  well, what are we waiting for.  uhh.  uhh. uhh.  ohh. uhh.   aha. diaper truck.  uhh.  earth's off the menu.   uhh.  we have to save them.  we have to save vixen.  starro will not be stopped from claiming his prize.  nor will i. uhh.  uhh.     your allies have failed.  now starro feeds.  hey, we're alive.  is this.  foam rubber.  i transmuted the concrete just before we hit.  way to go, jason.  we survived.  but we're no closer to stopping starro.  the tunnel. it leads under the stadium.  we can use it to evacuate the prisoners.  but with your powers, the parasites will be drawn right to you.  then in order to rescue the civilians, we'll need to civilians.  going into battle virtually naked.  the toy company isn't going to like this one bit.    why do you work with starro.  what do you get out of it.  starro came to feed on my world.  but the people of klaramar were not susceptible to his mind control and would not provide him sustenance.  what starro cannot control or devourhe destroys.  a bargain was struck, and i agreed to be his herald, tracking down other worlds on which the conqueror could feed.  work with us.  we can all defeat starro together.  and your people will be safe.  the prey always looks for mercy before the kill.  uhh.  this way. watch your step.  show me some hustle, people.  he who would dare rob me of my meal shall be the next to sate my hunger.   uhh.  skeet, suit me up.  shazbilly.  ahh.  uhh.  uhh.    uhh.  i have become bored.  but you interest me.  ok, i get it.  you think i'm a joke.  join the club.  a joke.  no.  i've never been more impressed.  if these spores are like batteries, then there's a limit to the energy they can hold.  shazam.   it didn't work.  it did.  that's how we stop it.  shout it again.  shazam.   shazam.   shazam.    ohh.    master.  it's over, hunter.  starro bit off more than he could chew.  over for starro, batman, not for me.  i have a new weapon to spread death and destruction on a scale my late master never dreamed of.   what is this weapon.  you.  aah.  uhh.  b'wana beast.     four arms: that all you got.   dr. animo: oh, hardly, my dear ben tennyson.  i'vegotthe yeti's mind. )
