 aah.  ung.  batman.  you don't belong here, batman.  leave now so that my pawns may finish the game i've set in motion.  equinox, you're working for kafka.  think bigger, batman.  i answer to a higher order, concerned only with maintaining balance in the world.  then excuse me if i tip the scales in favor of the good guys.   ugh.  like a pit bull off the leash, you attack without thought.  ready to leap at your own master's command.  brother eye, bring the ray.  you should have given peace a chance.  olmac, no.  aah.  aah. aah.  we were supposed to take him alive.  what can i say, bub. peace hurts.  i doubt buddy would agree.  who's buddy.   it's kafka.   kafka is gone.  there is only shrapnel.  what taste gets athletes  frosted flakes.  .  . we are tigers .  crunchy flakes perfectly coated with sweet ..  makes them a great tasting part of a nutritious breakfast.  . mighty, mighty tigers .  .  kellogg's frosted flakesare more than good.  ..  grrrrreat.  .  ] it.  ahh.  aah.  ugh.  aah.   buddy.  ..   just run.  olmac, i'm coming for you.  you failed to capture kafka.  and now he's become an even greater menace.  your perfect weapon malfunctioned.  and i have a hunch equinox was behind it.  who.  our intelligence has no record of an equinox.  the satellite link to olmac was simply disrupted.  buddy is an innocent man, and you put him in jeopardy.  he doesn't even know what he is.  what he is is simply a mannequin we can dress as olmac.  no. he's a person.  and if olmac had some of his heart, he'd be a soldier instead of just a weapon.  oh, i'd like another shot at him.  no you hey, batman.  kinda embarrassed myself out there.  guess i'm never gonna be much more than a nobody janitor, huh.  deep inside you, there's a tough guy ready to break out.  literally.  unh.  shrapnel.  you'll have to excuse me, buddy.  who's buddy.   he's still shooting pieces of his body.  and he's not running out of ammo or losing body mass.  .  let the doctors figure it out after i put that scrap heap in the hospital.  this time it might not hurt to try a softer touch.  a softer touch wouldn't hurt, ..hard.   aah.  ugh. unh.  aah.  batman.  i warned you not to interfere.  what's your stake in this, equinox.  what's yours.  i'm bringing a war criminal to justice.  the scales of justicebalancing right and wrongit seems our goals are really quite similar.  we're nothing alike.  they say the flapping wings of single butterfly can stir a wind on the other side of the world.  ever wonder what impact your little bat wings have on this world.  you gotta lot of fight in you for a mutant scientist.  but i never quit.  i'm pure warrior down to my bones.  aah.  ugh.  aah.  brainless fool.  you didn't just create shrapnel, you brought this entire war upon yourself.  the global peace agency came to my country to stop a war.  but destroyed an innocent village in the process.  crops, farmlandall gone.  the farmers survived to try to rebuild.  but i survived to get revenge.  aah.  look at their clumsy dance of devastation, batman.  i couldn't have choreographed it better myself.  ugh.  actually, i did choreograph it.  you're a madman, equinox.  my only desire is to keep everything stabilized.  you callthisstability.  not yet. but soon.  when the loss of one village is offset by the destruction of another.  aah. unh.  ugh.  aah.  unh.

 and equinox's plan will succeed.   ugh.   you're gonna take the whole place down and destroy us both.  correction. it will destroy you.  but i will become stronger than ever.  aah.  it ain't my style, but something tells me it's time to quit fightin' back.  brother eye, all power to shield defense.  try a softer touch, he says.  ugh.  ..thanks, bro.  are you certain this is the correct course of action.  fighting shrapnel only makes him stronger.  just keep those shields up, brother.  computer: meltdown eminent. evacuate. evacuate.  it's too late.  ugh. unh.  destroying one city doesn't make up for the destruction of another, equinox.  the universe requires equilibrium.  without it, everything deteriorates into chaos.  ugh.  you of all people should appreciate my efforts.  you maintain equal parts of dark and light.  it's what makes you such a formidable opponent.  aah.  ugh.  .  didn't you notice. i have.  running out of gas.   what are you waiting for. hit me.  all your strength comes from other people's energy.  looks like batman's softer touch worked after all.  grr.  ugh.   ha.  power levelzero.  nothing but a scrawnytwirp. ahh.  golly. how'd i wind up here.   batman.  it's time for buddy blank to finally be somebody.  computer: maximum overload eminent.  evacuate the premises immediately.  ..  not going to let you stop this meltdown.  that might not be entirely your choice.  don't be a fool.  the radiation will destroy you.  ugh.  this time buddy blank is not wussing out.  ugh.   computer: meltdown averted.   no. not this way.  not now.  looks like your flapping wings have stirred up a hurricane that evenididn't foresee.   you can't control my fate, equinox.  my life  mine to sacrifice.  i beg to differ.  batman.   let's get you out of here.  golly batman, you did it.  are you ok, buddy.  ii feel amazing.  this nobody just took on a supervillian.  well, i bet that creep knows better than to mess with us again.  if only that were true, buddy.  i'm afraid we haven't seen the worst of equinox.  animation captioned by the nationalcaptioning institute www.ncicap.org  you guys here for the safecracking job.   take a number.   so, what's
