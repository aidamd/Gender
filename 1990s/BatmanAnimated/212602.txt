 ra's al ghul is planning another assault using an environmental weapon.  the infrared satel 20 miles offshore from coast city, a possible indicator of his base of operations.  there have also been some minor seismic shifts recorded on an unpopulated island nearby, but the intel on that location is weak at best.  you are so predictable, batman.  excuse me.  you're trying to trick me into picking the first mission, which sounds all cool and dangerous, but is probably a waste of time, instead of the second mission, which sounds totally boring but is the one that secretly kicks butt.  ..what.  well, i've got news for you, bats.  i'm not falling for your little baitandswitch.  i have no idea what you're talking about.  we'll take the second islandyou know, the boring one.  come on, guys. let's move.   yeah. our first real solo mission.  i'm excited. aren't you excited.  yeah, thrilled.  hey, genius, are you sure you picked the right island.  fish boy, if there's one thing i know, it's how batman thinks.  if there's one thing i know, it's how robin thinks.  you knew from the outset that robin would assume you were trying to trick him.  which is why i was completely honest in my description of the two missions.  our young wards will be investigating ..   while we'll be infiltrating ra's al ghul's secret headquarters.  impressive ploy, old chum.  wouldn't you say, arrow.  i would, if i understood it.  seriously, my head hurts.     welcome, detective.  a shame i can't be there to greet you myself.  then the kidsyou meanthey chose the right island.  you know, you stink at picking missions.  ..  ..  ..  boys: awesome.  alright.  greedy i gotta tastethe fruity riches.  whoa. they're monumentally colorful.  uh oh.  that's mydelicious breakfast.  it's yummyin a mummy's tummy.  run.   this should straighten things out.  kellogg's froot loops cereal: the yumfully coloricious part of this balanced breakfast.   for the fruity tastethat shows.  w/w7>n well, well, well.  look who's flown the nesta cute little birdie and his playmates.  hello, talia.  i see you're still as evil as your powermad father.  can we stop flirting and just fight.            alpha 6 formation, now.  aquaman, stay in formation.  i am, old chum.  you're the one out of position.  wait. did you say alpha 5 or 6.    all: oh, yeah.  or not.   impressive display, boy wonder.  the detective has trained you well.      huh.    blinded by greed and consumed by the culture of excess, mankind has ravaged the planet's resources to the breaking point.  but this chlorochannon will return the meccas of pollution back to their natural state.  the first to fall will be coast city, but their fate need not be your own, robin.  the detective sent you here because he thought nothing of your abilities.  he will never see you as his worthy successor.  but my empire could be yours.   my daughter is a capable warrior.  unfortunately, a sharp tongue and a strong will are no substitute for a male heir.  join me, robin.  become the son i never had, and together, we shall restore paradise on earth.  gee, let me think.  uh, no.  ubu, grind them into fertilizer.   ..fertilizer.  he just said that to scare us.    well, by golly, it's working.    ra's al ghul's got quite a green thumb.  i think i shall call this adventure "     if you want to live, follow me.  she's so into me.  don't flatter yourself, little birdie.  i'm doing this for me, not you.  i couldn't risk that this death trap might convince you to change your mind and join him.  taking over the family business is my destiny.  i intend to claim it.  i suggest you do the same, boy wonder.  what's that supposed to mean.  don't you think it's time to stop living in the bat's shadow and be your own man.  oh, and robin.  yes, talia.  if i ever see you again, you're a dead man.  wow. that was brutal.  jeepers.  i'll say.  can we just get moving.   oh.  that madman.  poseidon's trident, a flying island.  it is time for humanity to meet its master.      y.     that's just wrong.  if we don't shut that cannon down, everybody in coast city's going to be plant food.   we've got to hurry.  that flying island is destroying coast city.  give it to me straight, bats.  do you think the kids are going to be ok.    it's not working.  maybe you're not doing it right.  i just did that.  uh, guys, it looks like the cannon's being controlled by a remote power module using an advanced form of wireless energy transfer.  what can i say.  i play a lot of video games.  can you shut it down.  gee, willikers. i can give it a try.  we'll have to manually steer the ship away from the city.  uhoh.  hold your positions. ubu's mine.    behold, a garden of eden on earth.  all i see is a big weed that needs to be whacked.  you are a most persistent thorn in my side.  long time no see, ra's.  i'd prefer it to be longershall we say, eternity.   you sure you don't need a hand.  shut up and steer.        aah.   look, i can help.  just keep turning. i've got an idea.   gotcha.   sit, ubu, sit.  any luck, speedy.  can't seem to override the cannon's remote power module.  what about short circuiting the firing mechanism.  that could work.  you're actually agreeing with me.  at least until we get out of here alive.  what do you think we should do, fry it.  freeze it. cryogenic arrows at your service.  1, 2, 3.     looks like your machine's been neutralized, ra's.  it's over.  far from it, detective.  there are still thousands of gallons of chloroplast stored in deep reserve that will level the city when the ship selfdestructs.    initiate selfdestruct sequencethis place is gonna blow.  initiating selfdes    goodbye, detective.  yours will be a valiant end, indeed.  that's not normal for a flying island, is it.  outrageous.  don't be so hard on yourself, old chum.  just think of him as the big one that got away.  and even bad deeds can result in some goodthe destruction of that cannon has given the sea life off coast city a chance at renewal.  and the kids did ok on their own.  speak of the devilfish.  congratulations, lad.  all of atlantis shall know of your heroics, and i shall call this adventure"the time aqualad finally got some welldeserved credit".  ..ok.  hey, listen, kid.  i'm sorry about all the lousy stuff i made you do.  guess i've been a little out of line.  you haven't been out of line.  you've been a jerk.  aqualad, speedy, where's robin.  robin's left the building.  you've trained me well, batman, but from now on, i make my own decisions, ..  heyactually, that's not
