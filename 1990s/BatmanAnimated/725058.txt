any loser.  just any loser.  uhh.  i mean, what's he stand for, anyway.  for all we know, the armor's calling the shots.  that is so not true.  uhh.  yeah, well, you have any clue how beetle would take down evil star.  whoa, evil star.  i'm still stuck on crazy quilt.  how did you get to that level so fast.  that's a good question.   hang on a minute, pac.  hello.  what do you think you're doing.  saving the universe.  you'll be lucky if you can save yourself.  uhh.  hang on a seco paco, i'm dying here.  i think i've got it.  great. let me dump this other call.  bats, i've really gotta go.  there's one thing you have tobeetle out.  teenagers.  so, this evil star dude gets his powers directly from starlight, right.  yeah. so what.  got it. thanks, paco.  one starlight blocking electromagnetic pulse coming up.  uhhuhh.   beetle, ease up, kid.  he's out. you won.  we're the good guys, remember.  sorry.  wait. did you actually follow me here.  i need to know you're ready for solo missions.  that's not just a suit of armor you're wearing.  it's a weapon.  weapon.  you're talking about my best bud here.  good idea.  art to oa and turn him over to the green lantern corps.  just one thingwhich way is oa.  oa.  i can't believe we're really here, that we're actually gonna meet the corps.  uh, hey, guys.  got a special delivery.  something wrong.  power down, and turn over the scarab.  excuse me.  nobody's holding you responsible, kid.  it's the armorgot you under its influence.  what's going on here.  stay out of this, bats. corps business.  is this a joke.  stand down, loser.  if it is, i gotta tell you, i don't think it's veryok, line 'em up.  ohh.   sorry, bug boy, but we gotta lock you up in the science cells, for your own good.  i don't think so.  whathyah.  gotcha.   jaime, guy, break it up.  why don't you keep out of it.  be a good boy, guy.  remember what happened last time.  you so much as sneeze without my permission, you're going to regret it.  that i'd like to see.  lucky punch.  now, will somebody, other than guy, tell me what this is all about.  perhaps i can help.  the scarab that generates your power, jaime reyes, is actually a piece of alien technology that belongs to our sworn enemies, an ancient race called the reach.  thousands of years ago, we guardians defeated these cosmic marauders, but not before they seeded countless worlds with scarabs similar to yours.  the scarabs give their host extraordinary powers, transform them into heroes of their people.  yeah, till their real programming kicks in and these "heroes" become the point men for a reach invasion.  wait a minute.  are you saying i'm some kind of intergalactic villain.  loud and clear, punk.  i've been training jaime for months.  he's a good kid.  if the scarab was controlling him, i'd know it.  well, if he's such a good kid, then he won't mind giving up the scarab.  i keep the scarab.  you want it, you'll have to take it from me.  in brightest day, in blackest night, no evil shall escape my sight.  let those who worship evil's might beware my power, green lantern's light.  poetry.  a sacred oath.  that's what i stand for, bug boy.  what do you stand for.  that's what i thought.  we shall see if the boy controls the scarab, or the scarab controls the boy.  that's some nerve treating me like this, suspecting me after all the good i've done.  what if they're right.  no, no, come on, that's impossible.  what did you say.   i said it is nothing personal.  this is what i am programmed to do.  what are you talking about.  we're partners, we're friends.   hey.  ..   but you belong to the reach now.  gaahh.  ..  authorized personnel override.  intruder, stand down.  intruder, stand down.  intrudercare to explain what you're doing.  jaime, snap out of it.  aah.  ..  told ya.  game's over, kid, and i win.  yeow. uhh.  unh.  hold it, hotshot.  uhh.  warningdefense protocols aborted.  warningdefense protocols aborted.  warningdefensejaime, what are you doing.   where am i.  in hot water, bug boy.  back off, gardner.  you two better get over here.  guardians of the universe, green lantern corps, you are ordered to surrender or face complete annihilation.  this is the final judgment of the reach.  the uniquelyglazedpopsalope: ..  in the numbersof its tasty pack.  ..  of the chompodilelurking nearby.  hungry for a crunch.  ..  ..  over the deliciousyellow creatures.   ..  of this balanced breakfast.   gotta have my pops. we congratulate you, infiltrator, for serving the collective so well.  you may now embrace your destiny and join us.  whatever you did to me, i'm gonna undo it.  i'munh.  get out of my mind.   the invasion of oa has begun.  all lanterns are ordered into space to defend our world.  maybe you ought to stay here and babysit the traitor beforeunh.  ooh. ooh.  jaime, don't let them control you.  theyunh. ooh.  there is no jaime, only the reach.    arrgghh.  uhh.  aah.    you brought that traitor here, bats.  when it goes down, it's gonna be on your head.  that "traitor" could have destroyed us all, but he didn't.  which means that jaime's still in theresomewhere.  uhh.  they're after the central power battery.  if they take that out, our rings are as good as dead, and so are we.  uhh.  aah.  aah. unh.  aah.  jaime, you've got more strength than you ever realized.  it's not just the armor.  it's in you.  use your will power.  fight back.  uhh.   batman.   uhh.  human garbage.   your resistance is futile, jaime.  our programming cannot be overridden.  no. we're stronger than that.  uhh.  the only reason you've been a hero is because the reach allowed you, allowed us to be one.  without their will, we are nothing.  aah.  uhh. ohh.  we're not gonna make it, are we.  it's been an honor serving with you guys.  raah.  uhh.  uhh.  oa is ours.  not yet it ain't.  sorry, jaime, we must submit to the will of the reach.  we have to make our own choices, use our own will.  we're stronger than the reach, but only together.  me and youthe best team ever.  we are the reach.  no, we are the blue beetle.  aah.   miss me.  i knew you wouldn't let us down.  i need you 3 to pour your remaining ring energy into my armor.  like that'll ever happen.  another few minutes and we're done for anyway.  why not trust someone for once in your life.  i gotta say, that's pretty ironic coming from you, bats, but what the heck.  let's do it.  uhh. unh.  there is no hope.  there's always hope.  no, the lantern energy is poisoning the collective.  uhh.  in case you hadn't noticed, kid, blue beetle just saved oa.  welcome back, partner.  we will have these analyzed, catalogued, and then destroyed.  jaime reyes, not just the guardians, but all who live owe you a debt of thanks.  however, we must now ask you to surrender the scarab.  butnot so fast.  when it comes down to it, bug boy here kicked that scarab's tail.  if you ask me, the kid proved he can handle this tin suit.  perhaps jaime reyes has proven that he is the master of the scarab.  so does this mean we're buddies, guy.  let's not get carried away.  next time you get the urge to go off on a solo mission, jaime, i think you'll be ready.     qu.  est bien, caria.  ya vengo pronto.   hola.  dnde ests, pequeito.   caria, me asustaste.  aah.    argost:   fiskerton:   zak: nope.  a little higher.  the canyon must still be blocking the signal.   fiskerton:   zak: i know.  i'm sorry, fisk, but "weirdworld" is gonna be on any second.   fiskerton:   zak: hey, i don't like him, either, but you know the deal.  argost knows more about kur than anybody, and the tv show is the only way he can teach me new  wait.  almost got it.  can you just get it a little bit higher, fisk.   fiskerton:      fiskerton: aah.   zak: almost got it.  can you get just a little bit higher.   fiskerton: what.  yowsa.    aah.   ah. ah. ah. ah.   zak: that's it.  nice job, fisk.    argost:ah, greetings and bienvenue.   did you miss me, world.  i'm touched.   doc: argost.   zak:    doc: it's all over the news feeds.  "weirdworld" is back on the air.   zak: but i thought doyle said argost was  argost:oh, how good it feels to reward your hope.  yes, boys and girls, argost lives.   komodo:    doc: it looks like doyle was wrong.  argost is alive and broadcasting.   drew: i can't believe i'm seeing this and so clearly.  how'd we get such a good signal down in this canyon.   fiskerton:   argost:my devoted fans, my misguided foes, and especially ..  oh, my, does your freshly unearthed uncle argost have a treat for you tonight.   doc: that's more than i care to see.   drew: looks like our hideandrest time is over.   doc: next move.   drew: let's go figure that out.   zak: sorry, komodo.  fisk and i need to talk.  you understand, right.   komodo:   argost:they call it "ahuizotl," a delightfully twisted cryptid from the )
