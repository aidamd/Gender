 ok, boys, grab the loot, and maybe a couple of those suckers, toto not so fast, babyface.  you've been caught by the long arms of the law.  well, if it isn't plastic man ..uh... and, uhelongated man.  you know, the ductile detective.  never heard of you.  i just don't get it.  i'm morere professional, the better detective, and yet, the public prefers you.  ooh, not just the public, my dlist doppelganger.  batman, too.  whoa. oof. oh.  the caped crusader prefers to work with moi.  the dark knight only turns to you when i'm on another caseand then, only as a last resort.  oof.   bats and i are best buds.  we hang out even when there's no evildoing to be undone.      i would think batman prefers a partner who doesn't pilfer criminal proceeds.  low blow, high brow.     that taffy puller should keep you wrapped up for a while, see.  this kind of incompetence is exactly why batman always chooses me.   he'd rather work with me any day of the week.    truth be told, between the 2 of you, i prefer to work alone.  animation   5 months of careful research to culminate inthis one magnificent moment.     dr. choi. hello.  doctor. aquaman here. what's new, old friend.  i was just in the middle of conducting a delicate tachyon detection experiment, old friend.  tachyons, eh. splendid. atta boy.  get to the point.  i'm calling about batman.  he'show shall i put this.  shipping a bit of bilge.  describe the bilge.  we were fighting that toxic torment chemo, ..   well, he took one in the face.  i'll be right there.  ooh.  outrageous. ugh.  what miracle is this.  as the atom, i can shrink to the size of a subatomic particle and ride electrons along the phone wires.  do it again.   oh, my.   open wide for me.  siliconbased microorganisms.  specifically, fastreplication monoclinic phylosilicates.  what kind ofofedicine shall we proscribe, doc.  you don't know what kind of doctor i am, do you.  a hero doctor, through and through.  a physicist. and this goes beyond medicine.  batman's cells are mutating.  before long, they'll overwhelm his central nervous system, causing a loss of motor control, then paralysis, ..  then we don't have much time.  chemo's headed out to sea, straight for the bialyan nuclear test site.  forget chemo, old chum.  the navy can handle him.  the only way to halt this process is for me to go into your body and destroy the organisms myself.  sounds like an adventure.  think you might need a strong swimmer along.  one with the heart of a beluga whale.  oh, i don't thinktake him. you'll need the muscle.  then, promise me you won't do anything foolish.  activity makes a virus spread faster, ok.  say, "ahh." and remember, stay put.  ahh.   i thought they'd never leave.   the human lung.  mother nature is truly our greatest architect.  lookdendritic cells, alveoli.  yes, yes, all very interesting.  but how small are we.  about 15 micronssmall enough to slip between batman's cells without damage.  and that's batman's cilia you're hanging from.  cilia and sillier.   alleyoop.    you know, this can't help but remind me of the time i ventured into the belly of a giant squid to retrieve the enchanted pearl needed to savave the falkland islands.  let's stay focused on the mission at hand, shall we.  finding those silicon compounds.  yes, professor.   my body grows weaker with each passing moment.  only the thought of the destruction that walking chemical spill will wreak keeps me focused.     loss of motor control, check.  .  . ba da ba ba ba . parfait.  .  now when you eat gogurt, you could winan awesome trip.

as we travel through the villi, the cp4 barium sonar wave will indicate any monoclinic phylosilicates in our vicinity.  english, man, english.   this little doohickey beeps when the cooties are near.  ahh, icooties, yes.   ok. now we're cooking.   these phylosilicates are dangerous, so let's think this out.  en garde, you microscopic misanthrope.   we shall call this adventure "the one where largerthanlife heroes "  whwhat.  it's replicating.  yes, and it's making more of itself, too.  we'll just have to fight harder.    oof.  now's the time for thiing, not fighting the problem with you, atom, is that you think when you should feel.   timeo y things my way.  ] a mp electromaic setck will destroy them rvrvrv see. thinki's no toh.  maybe you should try it someme.    there's no way they could have spread this quickly, unlessunless batman disregarded my orders for bed rest and went after chemo.  of course he went after chemo.  he's batman.   worry not, poindexter.  i shall lead us to safer ground.  wait.  at our size, blood vessels are raging rivers of death.  not if summon us a sturdy steed.  and what, exactly, are you going to summon.  there are no fish in batman's i stand corrected.   giddyup.   evasive subroutine 2niner. go.  concussive grenades, full power.     let's hope atom and aquaman are having better luck than i am.  they're going to kill us.   huzzah.       i'm king of the sea.  just get us out of here.     that was outrageous.  i'll admit, we survived.   good boy.  you were magnificent.  yes, big hug.  he's not hugging you.  he is merely interpreting you as a foreign body to be surrounded and destroyed.  sure feels like a hug to me.  and since we found you in batman's blood stream, i think we'll name you platelet.  except that's a lymphocyte.  platatelet it is.   neptune's beard, they're everywhere.  and we're not going to be able to beat them headon.  not the way you fight, no.  our only chance is to find and destroy the seed cell, and based on these symptoms, it can only be in one placebatman's brain.  then let's ride.  hiyo, platelet, away.     chemo went to a lot of trouble to get that nuke.  "but for whom." is the question.  who's the real brain behind this mindless brute.  you poor, pitiful fool, batman.  i believe this is checkmate.   the brain.n.ronic.  as much fun as it was watching you match wits with chemo, our little toy is now going where no one will get to it.  and if the bialyan people do not surrender to my rule, my lackey's corrosive juices will eat through the bomb's housing, causing an explosion that will destroy their entire country.  but before we get to that nasty business, batman, i think it is time for chemo to put you out of your misery.    eject.   fruity pebbles.  he's as big as the taste of my post fruity pebbles cereal.  part of a good breakfast.  big fruity blast in every little bbles piece.  gasp.  hee hee. bamm bamm.  huh.  sweet.  barney.  your pebbles.hee hee.  now you can win a sleepover at the smithsonian.  in post cereals, battle of the smithsonian instant win game.  no purchase necessary.  many will enter,few will win.  details and free entryon marked boxes of pebbles andhoneycomb.  or go towinasmothsoniansleepover.com.   batman's brain.  is that the seed cell you spoke of.  this field pressurizer will obliterate it.   what in davy jones' locker is sappening.  they're mutatinggrowing bigger, stronger.  it's as if batman's been exposed to chemo's toxins all over again.  tell me you have a plan.      submit, you mindless plebeians.  bow before the brain.           and now, for the brain.  come on, doc. write us a heroic prescription.  ii don't know.  every course of action i can think of leads to unacceptable consequences.  then this is not the time to think, but the time to act.   what are you doing.  drawing their forces so you can destroy the seed cell.  but you'll never survive.  perhaps, but at least i'll have one heck of a story.    huzzah.   impossible.  my plot was foolproof.   batman.   i'm taking you in.  a brave but futile gesture, detective.  the fastreplicating silicates chemo infected you withh are going to kill you.  even now, you can barely stand.     so, it comes down to thisbrain versus brawn, manoamano, locked in mortal combat.      platelet.  now you've done it.     outrageous.  evildoers, beware my wrath.  uh, what about the plan.  blah, blah, blah. let's punch 'em.              ho, ho, ho. now, who is the weakling.  and so, it ends.    sacre bleu.  but chemo's microorganisms should have killed you.  i've got microorganisms of my own, brain, and mine work for thgoode uys.  die, you fleshy fool.   your mind is twisted, brain.  you can think about the error of your ways while doing hard time in a bialyan prison.  i've not seen heroics like yours since the time i saved an elderly merman from a pack of great whites.  good show.  but you know, coming to my aid like that was not the rational course of action, doc.  let's call it a momentary lapse in judgment.  our victory, though, has come at a great cost.  ah, platelet.  i'm so sorry, aquaman.  he was a valiant steed.  but lymphocytes never last long.  come, then.  let us honor platelet and live as heroes.  take us home, old chum.  there's only one way out.  left at the jugular, then on toward a tear duct.  but surely, batman never cries.  animation captioned by the nationalcaptioning institute www.ncicap.org )
