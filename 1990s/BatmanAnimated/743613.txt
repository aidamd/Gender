    all:    sorry i'm late, folks, but my invitation must havegotten lost in the mail.  and on behalf ofall my talented colleagues ..     you don't deserve that award, riddler.   hyah.    boys, i can't believe you started this shindig without me.  unh.  i didn't know you called her.  i didn't.   uhh.   who is that masked woman.  i like her style.  uhh. your methods are unacceptable.  crime fighting's nplace for thrill seekers, katrina.  how do you know who i am.  katrina moldoff, worldclass athlete and acrobat, famous heiress to the moldoff circus fortuneit wasn't that hard to figure out.  crime fighter ethics prevent me from exposing your secret identify.  but if you continue to endanger innocents, what's the matter, darling.  threatened by a little competition.     uhh. look out.    ..  you know, for a girl.  little too rough for you.  riddle me this.  why are you like a bride on her wedding day.  answerbecause you're about to be unveiled.   it's that famous heiresskatrina moldoff.  hey, katrina. over here.   that was a dirty trick, riddler, even for you.   how does it feel to be exposed.  gosh.  looks like that's the end of her superhero career.  i feel kind of bad for her. don't you, batman.  actions have consequences, robin.  katrina was endangering herself as well as others.  maybe this is for the best.     no one stops the spinner.  uhh.  uhh.   is it just me, or is everything starting to spin.  it's just you.  got a new girl, i see.  your ego could never handle a real woman, could it, darling.  always your city, your rules.  why would you care when the courts outlawed me from ever being in costume again.   man: following a daring escape tonight from blackgate prison, police have issued and allpoints bulletin for the riddler, who is considered to be armed and dangerous.  perhaps it's finally time for a little payback.   felix faust, at your service.  how may i assist youoh, no, no.  let me guess.  a potion, perhaps, to heal a broken heart.  do i look like a lovesick teenager to you, mr. faust.  mmm.  then that must mean you are here looking for revenge.  more like satisfaction.  oh.  well, that requires a much darker magic..  inexperienced.  trust me. i can handle it.    batman speaking.  batman, it's katrina. i need your help.  my lifeit's all falling apart.  this isn't a good time.  please, you don't understand. i'm desperate.  i don't know where else to turn.    ok. i'll be right there.   thank you for coming, batman.  we may have had our differences, katrina, but i'm still a concerned friend.  and i thought all my friends left me years ago.  it's shocking how life can change in an instant, isn't it.  how i'm forced to live as a recluse while others go on as if nothing happened.  society would have never treated a mantreated you, batmanthe way it treated me.  actions have consequences, katrina.  we live with our choices.  still, there's time to make things right.  oh, darling, i intend to.  you know, before you got here, i almost made the biggest mistake of my life.  i almost didn't go through with this.   what are youuhh.   katrina, what have you done.  i'm you.  and you're me.  what could you possibly hope to gain.  oh, puhlease. i have a list.  freedom, for one thing.  no longer will i have to hide in the shadows.  then there's my personal favoriteretribution.  the riddler will finally get what he deserves, and batman will take all the blame.  not if i have anything to say about it.   batman would never hit a defenseless woman.  funny. i don't have that problem.  lright.  the tomb of the greedyfroot pharaoh.  i gotta tastethe fruity riches.  woah.  they're monumentally colorful.   uh oh.  that'smydelicious breakfast.  it's yummyin a mummy's tummy. run.     waaaooooohhhhh.  this should straighten things out.   kellogg's froot loops cereal: the yumfully coloricious part of this balanced breakfast.    for the fruity taste that shows.   where are the stupid keys.   voice authorization required.  um, batman.   destination required.  wherever it is i dwell, of course.     uhh.  so, it wasn't a dream.   clearly, my new center of gravity is ..  higher.   where have you been.  we were supposed to meet here over 2 hours ago.  darling, i don't have to answer to you.  i'm batman.  did he just call you "darling".  what are you waiting for. an invitation.  the riddler's escaped, and we're going to find him.  this time, that freak's looking at 20 years behind bars.  i have a much worse fate in mind.  life in solitary.  try no life at all.  um, you lost me.   why am i not surprised.  and do you know why.  because i hate him, hate him, hate him.  uh, by that, i mean, one more thingnightwing. nightwing.  and i need the absolute truth.  do i look fat in this outfit.   i've got to find something else to wear.  this getup is going to make me a prime police target.  but i don't exactly have a choice.  whoaoh.  felix faustrecently paroled from blackgate.  so, that's how she pulled off the big swap.   well.  look who's back so soon.  i thought you were the type who like to play dress up.  now, no need to be shy.  i knew you felt the same connection i did.  ugh.  ..  what was it called again.  well, it was a transmogrification spell.  why. was there a problem.  it didn't work.  ah. just as well.  why anyone with your body would want another one is beyond me.  i need a replacement. now.  this is why i never leave magic to amateurs.  as you wish, my dear.  but this time, i insist on coming along to ..  myself.  that's not necessary. pah, pah, pah.  it's my pleasure.    what is up with him. beats me.  police have spotted katrina moldoff donning her old costume.  the bat lady's back.   this could ruin everything.  nightwing. batgirl.  find that pest and turn her over to the cops.  i mean, the proper authorities.  but what about the riddler.  don't ask questions, you ridiculous creature.  go.  ..  permanently.  quick, follow me.  ooh. a fugitive, are we.    both: huh.  ..    there she is.  and she's working with that excon felix faust.  uhh.  what will the mayor say after i clean out every last bank account in town.  answerit all makes sense. ha ha ha.  hands up, riddler.  riddle me this, riddle me that.  who's afraid of the big black bat.  16%.  ..  isn't it time an auto insurer gave it to you straight.  that's why you should talkto state farm.  but not yet.  first, talk to any oneof the 40 million drivers who already have state farm.  40 million.  yeah, that's more than geicoand progressive combined.  by a lot.  40 million drivers.more savings.  and discounts up to 40%.  where else you gonna getdiscounts like that.  call an agentat 1800statefarm or go online.  nice entrance, batman.  just in time to ruin my little raid on gotham city's financial institutions.  but just so we're clear, there's not a prison in the world that can hold me.  oh, i have no intention of sending you back to prison.  don't tell me the caped crusader wants to make a deal.  let's make a game out of it, shall we.  you love those.  how do you keep the riddler from ruining your saturday night.  kill him on a friday.  better get yourself a new writer.  everybody knows batman doesn't kill peopleeven people who deserve it.  only one problemi'm not batman.  i'm katrina moldoff.  huh.  where did she go.  right behind you.  if it isn't the bat lady herself.  actually, it isn't. i'm batman.  nice to meet you.  katrina used black magic to swap bodies.  she's in mine. i'm in hers.  oh, please.  batman was acting really weird.  he even asked me about my shampoo.  if you are batman, tell me something only he would know.  your favorite color is blue, you used to sleep with a nightlight, and you're deathly afraid of monkeys.  it's him.  glad you agree. now, i need your help.  we must escape this dragnet and find katrina to reverse the spell.  he'si mean, she's going after the riddler.  then there's no time to waste. come on.  monkeys. shut up.  i've waited so long for this.   sleep tight, won't you.  i'm the one who usually hands out the clever riddles.  but it appears you've given me a much more interesting one instead.  when is batman not batman.  and do you know what the answer is.  who cares.  i'll either be getting rid of the real batman or getting rid of batman's body and katrina's smug personality at the same time.   i call that a winwin.  sorry, riddler, but i'm kind of attached to that anatomy.  hope you like it hardboiled.     i love a woman with a good left hook.  it was a right jab. start the spell.  but why are we helping his little sidekicks when we can let batman die.  just do it.  please.    uhh. ohh. hyah.  uhh. batgirl, take care of faust.  we need that incantation.   magic time, criminal scum.   uhh. unh. uhh.  uhh. unh.  uhh.  uhh. uhh.  uhh. uhh. uhh. uhh.  you have grown up quite nicely.  really.  uhh. lights out, riddler.  there's no room in this business for revenge, katrina.  an eye for an eye leaves everyone blind.  that's easy to say when you're surrounded by people you trust.  you can have the exact same thing.  and we'll be here to help after you've paid your debt to society.  i'm sorry, katrina.  don't worry about me, darling.  i'll get by.  ahh, she was something else.  i'm sure gonna miss katrina.  you do know, faust, that was me in her body.  ..  nobody's perfect.
