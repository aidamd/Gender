  you know he's wrong.  your silence is in honor of takahiro.  you didn't betray him.  takahiro sacrificed himself to make you reach your full potential.  he knew only the warrior of pure mind and gentle heart could wield that sword.   and i've forgotten his most important lessonself control.  the girl's guilt was quite tasty while it lasted.  but i'm still hungry.  he feeds off rage.  you were just the appetizer.  it looks like black lightning is the main course.   tony.  athletes  frosted flakes.  .  . we are tigers .  crunchy flakes perfectly coated with sweet ..  makes them a great tasting part of a nutritious breakfast.  . mighty, mighty tigers .  .  kellogg's frosted flakesare more than good.  ..  grrrrreat.  .  black lightning has always been a ball of fury.  i can only imagine what horrors he's reliving.   better brace ourselves.  this could be deeply disturbing.   aahh.   sprinkles.  on coffee.  .  oh.    so you're the reason i had to throw away a brand new pair of high tops, mr. i forgot the scoop at home.   and lady, didn't you get the memo.  no white after labor day.   not exactly the deep core of emotional trauma i expected.    you drive a vehicle that big just to haul a bag of groceries.   ..  you need to relax and get a hold of yourself.  how can i relax ..  .  that won't solve anything.  you're right.  i have to go after the filmmakers.  you're a superhero, you're bigger than this.  you know what else makes me angry.  superheroes wearing capes.  you can't even fly.  no, honey, i was going tono, you were supposed to pick up the kids.  hey, cyborg.  your call is about to drop.    seen your old master around lately, chatterbox.    so what's with the bat decal.  you're like a walking bullseye.   hiya, kids.  who needs a hug today.  oh, no.  it can't be.  not that.  not uric the unicorn.   it's only a kid's tv show.  hugs do not solve everybody's problems.  neither does rage.  every time you use your lightning, psychopirate gets stronger.  every day is free hug day.  the heck it is.  rainbows are made of unicorn smiles.  bath time is play time and good, clean fun.   rainbows are made of unicorn smiles.  happiness is a warm hug.  that warm enough for you.  you're showing the same kind of resentment and intolerance that drove the outsiders underground in the first place.  use your passion to stop the real threatpsychopirate.   he's right.  ok, ok.  it's only a silly's children show.  ..  warm hug.  ..unicorn smiles.  congratulations, batman.  you've snatched two succulent courses from my jaws.  but i still have room for dessert.  well, the worst is over.  once we spring metamorpho, we're home free, right.  don't be so sure.  you kidding. happy go lucky morpho.  i've never once seen him lose his temper.   looks like you're about to.  crime is over.  . .  . .  en in distance]   this cannot be the same metamorpho who sleeps with a fuzzy furry doll.  metamorpho's rage has been psychopirate's real fuel source all along.  you two were just pawns to keep him busy.  gee, thanks for that jolt of confidence, bats.   ok, i get it.  he's really steamed.  but what about.  look at them.  they know they can walk in public without being stared at, so they laugh at you behind your back.  they call you a freak.    wait a minute.  if this is all a dream world, he can't really hurt us, right.  in psychopirate's world, he can.  but we have to make sure not to hurt metamorpho.  he doesn't know what he's doing.   we can't blast 'em.  then what are we gonna do, reason with 'em.  it's our only choice.  his anger comes from feeling he's an outcast.  we have to remind him he's not.   well, here goes nothing.  morpho, buddy.  how can you be so mad when you've got the coolest powers in the world.  i mean, me, i'm just a talking electric socket.  and katana, she's a glorified paring knife.  but we count on you, dude.  ..  count on me.  it's working.  no, they use you.  they're jealous of your power and want it for themselves.   we need a twopronged attack.  you ep trying to get through to metamorpho.  i'll take care of psychopirate.  you don't really hate us, do you.   ok. not the answer i was hoping for.  oh.   yo, weak pirate.  you don't have the guts to take on the heavy hitters, so you go after kids.  that's it, batman.  feed me your fury.        metamorpho.  we became the outsiders because we all thought we were differentalone and unable to fit in with everyone else.  but that's what makes us, all of us, so cool.  we're a team.  we all need each other.  and we need you.  ah, sorry, guys.  my bad.  ..  hugs.      no.  you didn't.  ..  of course i did.  they are of no use to me now.  but remember, you're the reason they became heroes, so it's your fault they're oh. ooh.  no greater anger than the anger of the just.  you're still feeding.   this isn't the real lab.  indeed, batman.  we're in your nightmare now, and there is no escape.   there's always an escape.  what. what are you doing.  i'm feeding you the one thing you can't stomach i don't always need fury to fight with.   you're looking thin, pirate.  you should really eat something.  try this.    ..  ahem, and let the, uh, authorities deal with him.  speaking of authorities, keep an eye on psychopirate while i call them.  yo, those must have been some majorly happy thoughts to turn that machine into a junk pile.  yeah.  what are batman's happiest thoughts.     four arms: that all you got.   dr. animo: oh, hardly, my dear ben tennyson.  i'vegotthe yeti's mind.      four arms:   dr.

him.     brainstorm:  yeti, as they say in the "    dr. animo: no.  ii am your master. obey me.  heel. sit. stay.   i'm still paying for that.   brainstorm: your assistance was greatly appreciated.  go now. you are free.     dr. animo: whoa.  ah, but you've forgotten one thing.  my bomb is still going to go off, and there's nothing you can  kevin: yeah. taken care of.   gwen: attention, plumbers.  pick up in sector 7g.   roger that, gwen tennyson.  we're already on our way.  but why are you guys even out there.  all therealalien action is going on back in your own hometown, right in downtown bellwood.   we're live at the scene of destruction here in downtown bellwood, where what appears to be an alien creature has been going on a rampage.   galapagus:   the one question on everyone's mind is "where is "  galapagus:   kevin: not by the hair of my chinny chin chin.   ben: so you like a cool breeze, huh.   big chill: big chill.   galapagus:   big chill: that's what they all say.  okay, so

lucky.   ultimate big chill: what, you think it's anotherbaby alien.   kevin: i am never changing a giant diaper again.   oh. ohh.   galapagus:   kevin: them's fighting words.  probably.   gwen: i don't think it's talking to you.   galapagus:   kevin: hyah.   gwen: hey.  remember that dragon we fought who turned out to be an alien with a damaged translator.   ultimate big chill: yeah.  good times, good times.   gwen: our plumbers' badges work as universal translators.  maybe we should try them now.   kevin: i swear, if it's ..   galapagus:  i had no idea how to find you, oh, great ben
