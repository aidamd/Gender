 oh, no. wait, that's our hair.  we're in the same body.  the energy blast fused us together.  ..  why don't i feel the supercharged nuclear power.  he stole our power.  time to scramble, kid. run.  dah.    your conflict is with me, doctor double x.  we're not strong enough for a fight right now.  intriguing.  your body is generating over 2,000 megawatts of atomic energy.  this calls for further analysis.  to the bat cave.  unh.  the coward's have fled.  to the bat cave.  ..that was intense.  guess i better get to the bat cave.  today we're gonna be listening jenny's stomach.  the stomach has spoken. happy meal time.  ..  with an icarly toy inyour mcdonald's happy meal.  . ba da ba ba ba .  .  the most important part of a mcdonald's happy meal is you.  . ba da ba ba ba .  .># i don't know, batman.  your body is now a living nuclear reactor.  the suit will contain any residual radiation you are emitting.  who cares about he uniform.  ask him what he's got in the playbook to get me my body back.  well, maybe if you stop interrupting me.  ..  who i'm guessing you can't hear, can you.  no, i cannot hear your friend.  but since proper analysis of your dilemma requires concentration, i suggest you have your conversation elsewhere.  what's the holdup.  it's not easy working with you breathing down my neck.  well, until you get us some power, i don't have enough energy to completely phase out of your puny existence for a body.  this infusion will be only a temporary solution.  i just need enough to find that flamehead twerp from the nuclear lab.  aah. ha ha ha ha ha.  this place is so cool.  finally we agree on something.  let's go check out the weapons section.  i want to check out the atomic pod.   why do we have to go where you want to go.  it's my body.  it's our body.  and i vote for weapons.   dude, are you all right.  sorry.  so, uh, somebody jacked my ride, so i had to hoof it all the way back here.  i got the munchies somethin' fierce.  i'm fine. thank you.  okey dokey. mi bat cave es su bat cave.  later.  is it just me, or has that guy been making too many tackles without his helmet.  wow.  not many people can say they've been inside the bat cave.  that's because trespassing is against the law, punk.  unh. uhh.   what are you doing in the bat cave.  are you the one who stole my car.  'cause nobody steals my car.  you drove me here in the bat mobile, remember.  aah. unh.  what happened to "mi bat cave es su bat cave".  back off.  unh. uhh.  how did we do that.   so you want to play rough, huh.   uh, no, thank you.  cease these hostilities.  who are you.  no, you're not. i'm batman.  nuhuh, dudes. i'm batman.    so the nuclear blast at the lab evidently also separated us into 3 parts representing the 3 broad elements of our personality.  i am the logical and empirical aspect.  physical batman is the embodiment of our strength.  bully. i'm not kidding.  ..  i'm what's left without all that heavy personal baggage and science nerd stuff. groovy.  in other words, slacker.  shut up, coach.  ohoh, sorry.  private fight.  he cannot be a part of me.   i will get to work on finding a solution.  aah.    we believe we have discovered a solution.  by diverting a portion of the unique nuclear energy through the proper conduit, theoretically we can reverse both parties' ill fortune.  the atomic matrix is decaying, however, so there is a time factor.  dude, did you swallow a dictionary.  we think we figured out how to fix everything, but we don't have much time.  where's the other batman.  what do you mean.  " but all of the batmen must be together for the recombination process to be successful.  where do you think he went.  probably wherever he could crack the most skulls.    listen up.  this is to all the lawbreaking bottom feeders in here.  i know what you did, and i'm here to take you down.  so we can do this the easy way, or the hard way.    dude, that would be so uncool.  unh. ahh.  methinks mine eyes deceive me.  batman thrice.  somebody please deck this guy.  aah.  unh.  welcome to the party.  i don't understand why you insist on brawling with these thirdrate hooligans.  and you call yourself batman.    how about it, kid.   aah.   ..aah.  i'm going to get my power back even if it kills you.  help.  y.  you.  yes, i hear progressive has lots of discounts on car insurance.  can i get in on that.  are you a safe driver.  yes.  discount.  do you own a home.  yes.  discount.  are you going to buy online.  yes.  discount.  isn't getting discounts great.  yes.  there's no discount for agreeing with me.  yeah, i got carried away.  happens to me all the time.  helping you save money now, that's progressive.  call or click today.   aah. oof.  where is he taking our little schizophrenic candlestick.  aah.  the energy signature is unique.  it shouldn't be difficult to track.  aah.  'cause i'm just getting warmed up.   huh.   where are we.  you're the brainiac. you tell me.  good, you're awake.  i wanted you fully conscious when i drained you of the energy you stole.  now, this may tickle a bit.  aah.  with this power, double x will be unstoppable.  the only double xs you'll see are the ones i'm gonna put over your eyes.  you'll be the perfect test for my new power.  what. no one said anything about a test.  it's going to be a black day for the dark knights.  whoa. dude got big.  double x is feeding off the energy flowing into doctor x to increase his size and strength.   destroying all of you is going to be 3 times the fun.  cause pain.  find the off switch.   aah.  hey, we're getting our bodies back.  good for us, but better for the bad guys.  bummer.   oh, man. game over.  no, it's not.  but it is fourth and long with time running out.  we can take a knee, or we can go for the ..  as a team.    calling an audible.  unh.  let me out.  the energy transfer is not complete.  you know we're going to regret this, right.  probably.  my power.  nergy humming] remember us.  it's payback time.   aah. uhn.  hyah.   i won't go back into this spineless excuse for a human.  aah.  you 3 get in the chamber, and i'll use my power to reverse the process.  i'll pass.  it simply isn't logical.  seriously.  look, no one is smarter or more logical than science batman, no crime fighter is as tough as physical batman, and without slacker batman's heart, the world needs the one and only batman.  nice speech, but if you're gonna keep up with this hero stuff, you'll need a name.  i got itflame dude.  i'll consider it.  that's all i ask.    nice work, ronnie and jason.  you guys make quite the team.  ..  firestorm.  firestorm. you sure.  i kinda liked flame dude.  oh,
