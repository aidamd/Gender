 captioning mad iblele captioned by the nationalcaptioning institute www.ncicap.orgmy comrades have been captured, but i have eluded our hated enemies, and now, after one final test of my phase oscillator, i will use a wormhole to find allies on a parallel earth.  good. it made it to the other side.  dimensional wave is holding steady.   huh.  ..  with all of us after you.  ..  hand us the phase oscillator, or force will be required.  oh, i believe force will definitely be required.  hahh.  i got this loser.  uhh.  no.  hey.  you break it, i break you. got it.  the phase oscillator is undamaged, which is more than i can say for you.  aah.  i'm disappointed, hood.  after the makeover i gave you, i thought you would have wised up by now.  i guess i'll always be a little screwloose.  forget red hood.  we have what we came for.  owlman, blue bowman, scarlet scarab, with this, we can reach other worlds, infinite earths parallel to our own.  then a new frontier is open for business, silver cyclone, and the injustice syndicate is about to stage a hostile takeover.   yes, commissioner.  with the riddler'scrossword crime spree thwarted, gotham city can breathe easyonce again.   strange.  huhh. huhh.  so red hood was going to a batman for help.  red hood.  doesn't ring a bell.  but maybe this will ring yours.  you're slipping, batman.  owls see better in t t dark than bats.  actually, that's what i'm counting on.  aah.    a bridge to parallel earths explains a lot.  owlman's a parallel me, an evil one.  but why is he here.  questioning me is a waste of time.  this bird won't sing.  ..   stronger measures.  suit yourself.  precisely.  where are you going.  to get answers.  does that mean the dingus works as advertisese  the resemblance to my friends is uncanny, ..  of evil.  enough with the suspense.  when do we pencil in the invasion.  bad news.  that world is far too dangerous to invade.  everyone there has powers.  which would explain red hood's futile attempt to seek help there.  we need to rethink our plan.  you're the boss.   something tells me it's not going to be this easy.  then since plan "a" not viable, "  i hate it when i'm right.  plan "b".  but, guys, you can't be serious about using cyclone's bomb to wipe out their entire planet.  and why not.  because after that, what other crime could possibly taste as sweet.  the fate of their world will serve as a warning to all otherssurrender or be destroyed.  s uhh.  my voice and do exactly as i say.  well, then.  i'm thinking you should get me some mcnuggets.  night at the

earth's human infestation, my bomb requires our world's sole sample of promethium 90, thus the need for our raid on the nuclear laboratory.  what are you worried about anyway, owlman.  it's not like there's anyone to stop us.  i'm worried i'm gonna have to pick up your slack, like i always do.   a world without heroes.   my worst nightmare.  whaah.  the heroes aren't coming.  injustice syndicate represent.  feel free to scream.   fun later. first the job.  uhh.   the promethium 90.  i'll get it.  instruction: you mustn't break the container, or the isotope will be useless.   it looks like i just got an easy way to end this.   i'm the boss. i'll get it.  you watch the door in case any guards get stupid.  i heard you gentlemen were having a party.  mind if i crash it.   so much for a world without heroes, but his timing couldn't be worse.  i'm here to help.  you, help me.  is that some kind of sick joke.  it's what you invited me here for, isn't it.  you're from the parallel world.  here. put this on.  it's a batcommunicator.  be warned. i'm not much to look at.  i'm sorry, hood.  for what.  for this.  unh.  mission accomplished.  you sure took hood down easily back there.  easier than you would have.  so where are we keeping him.  where do you think. with the other heroes.  ofoursofe.  i knew that.  you've been acting strange ever since you came back from your trip.  question me again, and i'll do worse.  do you understand.  loud and clear, fearless leader.  you there.  something's off with owlman.  i wanna know what he's hiding.  stick close.  proclamation: before our plan is set in motion, you will tell us if you left any surprises for us in this other world.  what. don't like surprises.   ha ha ha ha ha ha.  it tickles.  your spirit is stronger than most humans'.  even when we found your hideout in the ace chemical plant, you fought valiantly.  ultimately, it was a futile gesture.  no. no. no.  aaaah.  but your psyche, though bent, did not break when faced with horrible disfigurement.    you even managed to rally a pathetic ragtag group of heroes in a final stand against the injustice syndicate.    and then, when all your allies fell, you still believed that you could somehow save this world.  but all humans can be broken,, and i intend to break you.   interrogative: tell me what you know.  stay strong, soldier.  the fate of both our worlds hangs in the balance.  but if he wants you to talk, then talk.  just tell me what you want from me.  excellent.  be ready to make your move.  i found a way to free you and the other heroes.  i wouldn't touch that if i were you.  huhh.   i know owlman.  owlman is a friend of mine.  you're no owlman.  red hood, change in plans.  i'm coming to you, but i need directions.  i'll tell you whatever i can.  yes, you will.  i'm in a long, curving corridor on the 50th floor, northeast sector.  what was your plan to defeat us.  there were just 5 steps left, but then you found me, and the plan went south.  got it.  and not just south.  we're talking right into a huge mess.   the others don't know what i'm capable of.  but one day, i'll show them.  i've got the true heart of a hero.   hero. a possible ally.  i keep it in a big jar at the back of my closet.  details. i require details.  hood, i'm in the mess hall. now where.  fine. but let me catch my breh.  i'm really exhausted.  exhausted.  exhaust port.  observation: left, right, south.  your responses contain a statistically improbable number of these words.  keeping me distracted as you pass coded instructions to your ally.   computer, locate owlman.  result: ventilation shaft.  end of the line, hero.  so, bowman, you prefer your owls roasted or fried.   up there.  well, owlman o onot, he's a dead duck now.  who is this guy.  i'm batman.  please tell me there are more of you on the other world.  lots.  ..  you are outnumbered.  observation: not for long.     raah.  huhh humph.      you lose, robot.  not quite.  that will only set it off.  open the wormhole, cyclone.  destroy batman's world.  unfortunately the phase oscillator is no longer in my possession.  well, then deactivate it before it blows us all to bits.  your concern for all of us is misplaced.  the bomb only irradiates organic tissue.  you backstabbingrobot. it's true. i do hate all humans.  whichever world is destroyed, i look forwardrdo an empty planet to call my own.  who's broken now, cyclone.  ready.  ready.  where to.  earth 161, zombie planet.  can't be killed.  you started something today, a brave, bold new era in crimefighting.  whoever he is, i hope my counterpart on your world will have a chance to repay you.  somehow, that seems unlikely.  oh, and expect an owlmanshaped package momentarily.   there's no place like  hands up, batman.  you're under arrest.  animation captioned by the nationalcaptioning institute www.ncicap.org let me in.  ..please.      so, um, i'll meet you guys at the library after dinner.  about 7:30.   you better.  if i don't get a "b" on my next   aah.   aah.   aah. )
