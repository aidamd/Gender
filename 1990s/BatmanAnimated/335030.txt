  looks like i wasn't the only one playing dressup on a parallel world.  uhh. uhh. uhh.   welcome home, dark knight.  owlman. you beat my failsafe holding cell.  hunh.  a titanium alloy 7pin, 8cam lock with only 3 layers of redundancy.  that wouldn't have stopped you.   and since you're alive, that means you defeated my friends and freed my enemies.  impressive.   i bet you'd like the keys to your life back now, such as it is.  uhh.  and you'd like the phase oscillator so you can go home and prepare an invasion.  unh. uhh.  uhh.  you're a hard bat to pin down, old friend.  hero one second, villain the next.  green arrow, the criminal you're after isn't me.  he's my evil double from a parallel world.  right.  uhh.  i have spider holes like this all over gotham, built to surprise my enemies.   never expected to use them to save myself.  bats knocked out 2 guards, blew up a lot of cash and got away from me.  whatever his game is, he's going down tonight.  and, no, your assistance is not required.  bat's in my crosshairs.  unh. aah.  uhh.  and to think, all those lectures you gave me about staying on the straight and narrow.  how does he do that.  uhh.  uhh.   no response from the car. of course.  owlman stole it and reprogrammed it.  blind alley.  he's trapped.  so this is how it ends.  not in a battle against criminals, but taken down by my own best friends.  how does he do that.  uhh. uhh. uhh.  tsk, tsk, tsk, batman.  our game was so simplebrooding hero, dashing devilmaycare villain.  i strap you to a drill press, you lock me in a rubber room.  and it's fits and giggles till aunt fannie comes home.  but if you think you can switch sides and outcriminal the clown prince of crime, it's only fair to warn you, i always blow away the competition.  uhh.  my voice

myself.  you need me, sunny jim.  if the new you is as good at being bad as the old you is at being you, then neither of you can beat the other on your own, see.  but if owlman's another you, he craves control.  and who better to take down a control freak than the nemesis of order, the crown prince of chaosmoi.  just think about how many times i've nearly punched your ticket.  the clown's crazy, but he's onto something.  adding an unexpected element to the mix could tip things in my favor.  found him.  and he's not alone.  ..  ..  or mine.  ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.  that's the clown's car. stop it.  o ha ha ha ha so, how we doing. did we get him.  you're an idiot.  we need to go somewhere safe to figure out our next move.  but owlman has the batmobile.   stop.  good thing i keep a spare.  we'll make the bestest team everjoker and batman.  take top billing, but why is it always me compromising for the sake of the act.  joker, if we're going to work together, i need your word you

owlman's files, he searched mine.  which means owlman knows every hero's weakness.  what. i'm helping.  i keep detailed files on my friends, methods to neutralize them, in case any of us ever fall under a criminal's control.  huh.  uhuhaah.  aah.  uhh.  i never dreaead my precautions would fall into the wrong hands.  evil hands.  well, joker, you ready to do this.  to the batmobile.  ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.   ooh. what's this one do.    ..  sensing a lack of trust, batsy.  i get itwe don't play well with others, so, end of the day, neither of us can count on anyone but ourselves.  arrow,
