 the funds of evil are always insufficient.   thank you for the deposit, evildoer. here is your receipt.   do something, taboo.  they're running on a nanosynthetic operating system.       ace, old friend.  apologies for being gone so long.  i need to check on the bat bots.  they apparently saw some action of their own in my absence.  bat bot, report.  robbery averted.  the perps, however, managed to avoid capture, keep patrolling for another hour, then return to base. batman out.  maybe next time, proto can help.  proto wants to hit the streets with batman. battle evil with hammocks of justice.  uh, that's "hammers" of justice, protobot.  you're a prototype, not suited for battlefield conditions.   i was overzealous in designing you.  bigger is not always better.  of proto is no use to batman, then why does batman not deactivate him.  you're good company for each other.  proto likes ace very much, too.   robbery in progress downtown.  another bank.  can proto come. please.  you know the rule, proto.  you remain in the bat cave.    proto does not like that rule.  only the foulest of fiends would pilfer the nest eggs of honest citizens.   batman.  surely we can discuss this like civilized gents.  the only talking you'll be doing is to the 4 walls of an 8 by 10 cell.  ya think.  a little late to the party, bat bots.  i've got this covered.  correctionthey are right on time.  you see, they're going to be playing on my team now.   all thanks to the robotic savvy of my main man taboo.  quit hogging the remote.  bat bots, eliminate him.  all right, black mask.  ..  then bring it on.  how courteous of batman to provide his own coffin.  it'll make disposing of him so much easier.  ahh, is he dead.  if not, he soon will be.  come on. let's get out of here.    proto understands.   batman needs proto's help.  can ace help proto help batman.    proto, ace.  criminals who did this must get pounded by hammocks of justice.  again, it's "hammers" of justice, proto.  and they will be, once we come up with a plan of attack.  . batman wants proto to work with him.  unh. thank you, batman.  proto will not let you down.  ..wish you would. let me down, that is.  proto is sorry.  it's ok. you don't know your own strength.  but you'll need to if we're going to stop black mask.  that's no problem. proto has good control.   it's about time.  mission accomplished.  whoa. c47 nukelaced explosives.  nice get.  nice, indeed.  but nothing compared to what gotham's about to get.  you'reyou're gonna blow up the city.  what sort of uncivilized brute do you take me for, taboo.  no.  i'm simply going to blow up part of the city.  just enough of it to scare the survivors into giving me control of gotham.  of course, none of this would be possible without these wonderful new additions to our little family.  ahh, on that subject, boss, some of the boys are feeling kinda, you know, crowded out by the new blood.  i see.  too many crooks in the kitchen, eh.  perhaps we should thin the herd.  ..  dispose of these incompetent ingrates.   ..  i'm keeping you on.  ..  for now.  luckily, the batmobile's interlink suffered minimal damage.   by zoning in on the bat bot's heat signature, i should be able to locate black mask's lair.   got it.  and just in timea major cache of explosives has been heisted. of course.  he's going to turn them into mobile nuclear bombs.   proto.  taking you with me wasn't such a good idea after all.  ..  but with explosives involved, i can't risk innocent civilians getting injured.  batman thinks proto's too big. too clumsy, too stupid.  there will be other missions.   the kitten is stuck. proto will get him.   proto, no.    you can be gentle.  kittens are not just cute, but also delicate and defenseless.  ok, proto, you're back on the mission.  but only if you promise to treat every citizen as if they were a kitten.  delicate, cute and defenseless.  proto will not let batman down.  or pick batman up.   ahh, target areas have been designated.  you have your orders. now go.  destroy, destroy, destroy.  r cs35 with red darts. only at targeteparately.  patching into a direct feed to gotham cable.  once the bombs are detonated, i will go on the air to inform the good citizens that i'm this city's new boss.  aahh.  sorry, black mask.  you're not ready for primetime.  but you are ready for hard timein arkham asylum.  taboo. get daddy's little helper.    aah.  ii'm sorry.  ii didn't mean to aah.  show proto where the bots are headednow.   there. you have everything you need.  don't hurt me.  proto will not hurt bad man.   ace will.    trading blows with me while half the city's about to be blown to kingdom come.  point taken.   proto.  we have to stop those bots.  proto understands.  proto activating war on evil mode.  ace, the lever.  huh.     bat bot felt hammers of justice.  i destroyed two.  ..  three.  that's only five.  the sixth bat bot is still out there.  we need to know its target.  the grid only showed proto targets for 5 robots.  blacmask, that tricky devil.  the sixth robot is a rogue, programmed to pick a target of its own choice at random.  proto will find and destroy the robot.  that's the problem. it could be anywhere.  there's no time.  a dog nose is sensitive, good for tracking.  you've got a good head on your shoulders.  but batman is the one who put it there.  ace, we need to locate the last bat bot.  its scent is identical to this one.   3 minutes until detonation.  whoa.  2 minutes, 45 seconds until detonation.  ..  defenseless like little kittens.  waiting for bombs to explode can be such a tedious affair.  .  detonation in 2 minutesone minute45 seconds30 seconds.   not on my watch, black mask.  you underestimate me, batman.  emergency override activated.  no. yes.  detonation code engaged.  proto must get bat bot away from here.  detonation in 5 seconds.  4 seconds, 3 seconds, 2 seconds, one second.     proto broke the street.  sorry.  ugh. curses.  foiled again.  ..  of a hero.  and a hero deserves to be out battling evil.  really, batman.  but maybe you'd be better off doing it someplace .. room to move.   it looks like proto has everything here under controland is having a lot of fun doing it.   don't worry, we'll see proto soon enough.  he'll be home for regular visits, and tuneups.  animation captioned by the national captioning institute www.ncicap.org gwen: what's the plan.   ben: i'm thinking.   kevin: wearein trouble.   gwen: okay.  let's work through this.  aggregor has three pieces of the map of infinity.   ben: we know.   kevin: it's true.  every time he got a piece, we were right there, getting our buttskicked.   ben: thanks for backing me up, kevin.   gwen: my point is maybe we can learn something from our losses, keep it from happening   azmuth: "learn something".  i only expect to live another 3,000 years.  i don't have time to wait for you to learn something.   ben: azmuth, i've got some bad news.   azmuth: yes.  you've failed to stop aggregor from gathering three of the four pieces of the map of infinity.  your ineptitude  kevin: harsh.   azmuth: what is "harsh" are the consequences of your repeated failures. )
