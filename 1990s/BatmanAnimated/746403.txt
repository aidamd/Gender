'cause she's got nothin' to say to you.    heh. same old trick again.  hyah.  problem now is you're just a big ol' paperweight.   move it, kid.   you could have killed yourself.  what were you thinking.  you mean, what was i thinking, trying to save a kid from being creamed by a traia.  you would have done the same.   you and your gizmos.  we should be on the chase, not playing mad scientist.  you know, nowadays, there's more to fighting crime than a thick skull and fists.  and i wouldn't need to track them with gizmos if i didn't have to bail you out while they got away.  twice.  and who says i needed you to bail me out.  you know, i've been doing this since you were in bat diapers, and i've gotten along just fine.  you have been doing this a long time.  maybe too long.  slug's not going to be happy about this.  you want to tell himim the bad news.  oh, no, man. i pass.  you know he scares me.  and i guess you're not feeling particularly chatty.  fine. i'll do it.   about time you showed up.  did you lay waste to that gross spectacle of commerce and wealth, like i told you.  yes, butexcellent.  did you see how dark it is up there.  did you feel their hate.  they despise each and every one of you.  but who took you in.  butyes, and when no one else would, not because i need you, but because i care.  and we're grateful for that.  ..  followed here.  intruders. ugh.   we can't afford to lose our special community.  you know what we must do.  maybe we can just scare them away instead.  and what, risk losing everything we've built down here.  this is the only place any of us has where we're not freaks.  toxic waste.  touching that stuff could cause mutations or worse.   no wonder these kids have been acting out.  wildcat, wait.     gas.   .

batman, and you won't escape your punishment.  this is my fault.  the world's changed around me, and i'm still the same as i've always beenall fists, no brains.  you were right.  i should have retired a long time ago.  if i wanted you to retire, it's because you've been like a father to me, anand i didn't want to lose another one.  well, maybe it's time for one final lesson.  hey, soft man.  think you can hurry things up.  i don't want to look at your ugly mug any longer than i have to.  are you talking to me, you decrepit sack of bones.  yeah, , m talking to you.  wildcat, what are you doing.  tell me, how do you stand to look in the mirror every morning.  if i saw that face staring back at me, i'd have nightmares.  shut up. shut up.  make me, freak.  release him.  don't do it, wildcat.  what good are 9 lives if you don't use 'em.  you were better off with the turtles.   but there's no need to keep my pets hungry.     batman.    come on. i'm a boxer, not a kitten.  give me what you've got.    i'll pound you into dust.  i better turn up my hearing aid, 'cause all i can hear is you sucking wind.          this is a boxing match, not patty cake.  step it up, lunchbox.   .. show you...  ..  you losing your wind. need a little rest.  then maybe you should take a nap.    ok, you sweaty meatball.  it's time to clean this place up, one piece of trash at a time.    you kids don't have to live down here rotting in the garbage and stewing in your own anger.  you're going to tell us how we can live.  you have no idea what it's like to be an outsider.  that's where you're wrong.  growing up, i a nobody from a bad neighborhood.  got beat up every day, twice on sundays.  i could have gone down a darker road.  but instead, i found the ring, put the gloves on, and never looked back.  think a bunch of ragtags like you could learn a thing or two from an old timer like me.    why haven't you destroyed them. traitors.  ingrates. freaks, all of you.   we're not freaks, slug.       wait fahh.   oh, no. ohh.  not now. ohh. oh.       ooh.     good riddance.  batman: wildcat.  wildcat.  batman. what is it.  it's his heart. be calm.  ok. listen to me carefully.  you know i hate to repeat myself.  metamorpho, his lungs need oxygen.  black lightning, let's see if we can't give this jalopy a jumpstart.  everyone, clear.  again. clear.  come on. wake up, dude.   don't worry, son. ohh.  still got about 4 lives left.  and who are you callin' a jalopy.   that's it, kid.  stick the jab.     this is the best milkshake ever.  yo, katana, have you tried this.  it's got fish and bananas in it.    with wildcat's help, who knows.  maybe these outsiders have the makings of something bigger.   come on. let me have it.    oof. ugh.  goodgood swing, son.  animation captioned by the national
