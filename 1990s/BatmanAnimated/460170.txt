 where am i.  exactly where you deserve to be, grodd.  i'll crush your miserable human skull.  i'm afraid your latest plan for global conquest would disturb the equilibrium.  and for that, you must be eliminated from the equation.  the question is, what am i doing here.  i was trying to put a stop to grodd's scheme.  why destroy me.  ah, a question.  to keep everything equal, of course.  if i eliminate a black pawn, a white pawn must go, too.  it's an essential part of my quest to bring the world into complete balance.  funny, you sound like the least balanced person i've met in a long time.  batman.  your arrival has offset my beautiful equipoise.  you only have time to save one of them.  which will it be, batman.  good or evil.  how do you know that would stop it.  whoever he is, anyone that obsessed with balance would never allow an unequal amount of good and evil to be destroyed.  come on.  two against one. hardly an even fight.  but perhaps the hand of fate will restore balance.  uh. uhh.  ooh.  it's over.  this is just the way i like it, batman.  perfectly balanced.  because either you release me now ..  we both meet our doom.   uhh.  uhh.  don't worry, batman.  when the time is right, you will again meet equinox.  who was that guy.  excellent question.  animation   according to my calculations, it's almost time.   what is that, a beached whale.    oh. hello, old chum.  it seems you've caught me singing the sad song of the sea.  as interpretedby the beluga whale.  now, tell me, what brings you to this lovelythough ultimately temporary stretch of sand.  well, at any moment, i'll be catching a zeta beam for a solo mission to the planet rann.   it's important to stresssolomission.  aquaman's enthusiasm for adventure usually means he'll invite himself along.  well, better you than me.  good luck, boss.   ..tag along.  no. not really.  you sure.  adam strange summoned me to his adopted home world because it's being invaded by the gordanians, and i could really use your help.  aquaman, is something bothering you.  i don't know.  i guess i just don't see the point to this hero stuff anymore.  nobody can really help anyone else.  not really.   that tears it.  you're coming with me.  the effects of a zeta beam only last temporarily.  we'll have to work fast when we get to rann.  great neptune's beard.  the zeta beam's dropped us in the middle of a firefight.  in the middle of the sky.  ohhh.  aah.  adam strange, as punctual as ever.  how nice of you todropin.  ha ha ha ha ha.  and here's my lovely wife alanna, right on time.  behold, my friends, rannagar, jewel of rann.  father.  batman has arrived, and he's brought a friend.  saradath, high science arcon of rann, this is aquaman.  welcome, aquaman.  if the most brilliant strategist on earth sees fit to bring you to rann in our hour of need, you'll doubtless prove an invaluable ally.  oh, how i wish that were true.  he's not feeling well.  people of rann, our ageold conflict is at an end.  surrender now and perhaps we will show mercy.  annihilation is preferable to any mercy we might receive under gordanian occupation, general kreegaar.  then you shall have your wish, adam strange, champion of rann.  gaze upon your doom.  a gordanian battle tripod.  our defenses are no match against such a force.  then all is lost.  woe is us.  perhaps it's not too late to surrender.  i think i've got a better idea.  huh.  your lust for conquest ends here, you reptilian rogues.  rrahhh.   ehh.  uhh.    rrahhh.  unh.  you weren't expecting our little welcome wagon, were you, kreegaar.  unh.  yaah.  hunh.  on the contrary, strange.  i was hoping you'd pay a visit.   i should have known.  this was all a ruse to flush you out, adam.  the earthman who acts as champion of rann has deterred our invasion plans before.  but now we're turning theheatup on you.   as your blood boils, adam strange, know that the same fate awaits your beloved rann.  ah ha ha ha ha haaa.    this thermal energy is going to incinerate us.  we're going to be baked alive.  uhh.  my voice and do exactly as i say.  well, then.   respect the pouch.  respect it.  . everywhere we gooh .  .  . people want to knowoh .  no team practice today.  . who we arear .  that doesn't stop a tiger.  . so we tell them .  .  you always find a wayto work hard and eat ..  with kellogg's frosted flakes, the greattasting part of a nutritious breakfast.  . mighty, mighty tigers .  and you never stopearning your stripes.  they're grrreat.  .  aw  it's time to fight fire with fire.  fantastic.  i like my tan just the way it is. ha ha.  laughter in the face of danger.  does he not understand what's at stake.  3 heroic hunks at my feet.  i must be doing something right.  the gordanians must be searching for the eye of zared.  a legendary doomsday weapon created millennia ago during the civil war that almost destroyed rann.  it would be located in the ruins of zared, which was swallowed up eons ago by the sea of abex.  if the gordanians get their hands on it, countless worlds would be destroyed.  then the 3 of us should head out immediately.  aren't you forgetting someone.  judging from your last escapade, you boys can't get along without me.  no, my interplanetary sweetheart.  it's too dangerous.  any peril you face for rann, my love, we face together.  great grouper.   there. it's the ancient city.  looks like there are some new arrivals to the neighborhood.  great stars. the eye of zared.  and they're almost finished excavating it.  it's time for operation sea sanction.  there may be a better way.  aquaman, can your telepathy summon the ocean creatures to help us against the gordanians.  suppose we could try.  the horned whales of abex.  excellent.  have them flank the gordanian excavation crew and draw their fire while we head straight into the middle andgo. get out of here.  now.  what is wrong with you.  you've been nothing but an albatross around the neck of this mission.  i heard stories of your great heroism, but clearly they were works of great fiction.  you want some of me, helmet boy.  adam, aquaman and i need a moment alone.  let's see how far the gordanians' excavation has gotten.  ok, what's going on with you.  i don't know what you're talking about.  we've been friends a long time, aquaman.  i've never known you to be depressed or halfhearted or unheroic.  ..  i was on patrol last month when i received word that some beluga whales were being illegally hunted in the bering sea.  by the time i reached the whales it was too late.  iwas too late.  it wasn't a daring exploit or a heroic adventure.  it was a tragedy.  and it was my fault.  you know it wasn't.  but we may have another tragedy on our hands if we don't get back to the old aquaman, the one who makes people believe victory is possible even in the face of overwhelming odds.  i'm sorry, batman, but that aquaman was a fool.   the gordanians have spotted us.  unh.  aah.  adam, help me.  uhhh.  alanna. hold on.  i'm coming. almost there.  the zeta beamit's wearing off.  nooo.  adam.  adam.   oof.  alanna.  almost had her.  now she's 25 trillion miles away, and i can't do a thing.  ha ha. wheeee.  hey, ronald. come on, let's go play.  oh, i wish i could, but i have to go to work.  bye. bye, ronald.  .    okay, here i am at work.  now we can play. woohoo. yay.  . ba da ba ba ba .  whoa. wahahaha.  another zeta beam is scheduled to hit nearby in 45 minutes.  gotta hurry.  aah.  ..  this way, i can just make it.   gotta time this just right.  unh. it's too late.  the gordanians have her.  i'm sorry, adam.  uhh.  the best way for you to help her now is to join in the fight to bring down that thing.  great stars. they have the eye of zared.  according to legend, the eye is invulnerable to attack.  it may be more than legend.  it runs on solar energy.  and as long as the eye stays on the day side of the planet, it will run perpetually.  ..that's it.  it's over.  ..  i've failedeveryone, everything.  what has gotten into you, man.  ////////////////////////////// you're alive.  and where there is life, there's always hope.  but we're outgunned.  so what.  we don't even use guns.  the eye is invulnerable.  all the better to prove we are true heroes.  alanna is their captive.  for now.  this isn't the end.  it's an opportunity.  most men wait their entire lives in vain for a moment like this.  a chance to matter.  a call to adventure.  adam, answer that call.   you sound like a man with a plan.  saradath.  what we need is an eclipse.  but that's not possible. rann has no moon.  maybe, but our earth does have a moon, and we're going to need to use that zeta beam contraption to capture it.  how's your aim, batman.  impeccable.  we'll see about that.  ha ha ha ha ha.  and youare you willing to face impossible odds to save the woman you love.  of course.  good answer.  now here's the plan.  to move earth's moon, the zeta beam will need a lot more power.  i'll take an insulated cable to the sea bottom and tap into the thermal energy fissures to boost the zeta cannon's power.  this is folly.  aquaman's plan cannot work.  it's got to.  strange, you need to buy us some time.  get into the eye of zared and distract those scaly fingers.  oh, and rescue your lady whilu't the power. the cannonit's charging.  it's reaching omega levels.  we're tied into the very core of rann.  good work, aquaman.  careful, batman.  25 trillion miles.  even a tiny miscalculation could have devastating effects to life on earth.  .  the entire ship has lost power.   huh.  enjoying the lunar eclipse, general.  rann has no moon.  ohh.  it does now.  rraahhh.  aaaaahh.  ahh.  the gordanians.  they surrendered.  without their doomsday weapon, they've agreed to talks.  and our moon's back where it belongs.  too bad.  looks like those two could use a little moonlight.  ..  the strange encounter of the reptile men.     we're coming after you    we're
