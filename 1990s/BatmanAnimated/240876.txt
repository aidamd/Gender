so i'm still going to blow it up.  but you promised.  word to the wisenever trust someone who has a warmoon.  actually, i didn't.  mymy warmoon.  you know you want to say it" very clever, humans.  just for that, i will destroy all of you before i go.  wrong again, mongol.    the only place you're going is a small cell on oa.  ha. one punch. what a mook.  you mean you and bats never raced in

is our stop.  my adoring public awaits.   gwen: just have to have your minute in the spotlight, don't you.   ben: jealous.   is it true you're dating jennifer nocturne.   whatisthat.   ben: oh, not now.  what was so important it couldn't wait untilaftermy interview.   max: your newfound fame is the problem.   gwen: how.   max: ever since the world found out about your powers, a lot of your old enemies have come crawling out of the woodwork, hoping to get revenge by hurting those close to you.   ben: like who.  i haven't seen anyone.   max: and i was hoping to keep it that way.  so far, i've been able to deal with them without your folks knowing what's going on.  but now, well, i can't do this alone anymore.   gwen: you should never have been alone, grandpa.  you should have let us help.   ben: all you had to do was tell us.   max: you kids have enough to worry about.   gwen: this isn't right.  there's supposed to be rules.  family is offlimits.   kevin: if that's how they want to play it, fine.  one of those creeps comes after our families, we put them down.  permanently.   gwen: meaning what.   kevin: yoknow exactly what i mean.   max: at first, i thought the attacks were random, but i was wrong.  they're organized.   ben: organized. by who.  gonna be here.   charmcaster: well, he's not.  and i don't know about you, vulkanus, but i don't wait around for anybody.  zombozo.   zombozo: my apologies, charmcaster.  i'm usually quite punctual, but i got a bit caught up in my work.  good help is so hard to find.  particularly if you carefully bury the remains.   vulkanus: yeah, yeah, we get it.  you're creepy and dangerous.  that hasn't gotten your people any closer to tennyson's family.   zombozo: true, and that's why i've askedyouhere.  i'm taking matters into my own hands.  i need the best at my back, and that'syoutwo.   vulkanus: so, what do we do now.  every time anybody attacks tennyson's home, they're beaten.   charmcaster: then the answer is simple.  we don't attack them at home.  we wait until they're not expecting us.   zombozo: that's it exactly, charmcaster.  now we're finally thinking like a team.    ben: everything okay.   my body and spirit are in total balance, son.   well, my spirit is in total balance.  why do you keep asking me if i'm okay.  is everything okay with you.   ben: me. uh, sure.  ..  i, uh i hear there's this nasty, uh, uh, flu going around ..   hey, where's dad going.   uh, carl is going to pick up a new grow lamp.  why.   ben: does he really need to go.   unless you want the plants to die. )
