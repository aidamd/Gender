museum. heh heh.  uh, i wonder what's on the old telly tonight.  ..obtained security footage of the disturbance at the museum of art.  ..  uhoh.  ..lost infant and adorable, helpless dachshund in imminent danger.  oh, boy.  makes one wonder where the adult supervision is here.  ..  i got nothin'.   ah heh heh hee.  you just couldn't control yourself, could you.  ..   and i have stood by you, but so help me, this time, i am through.  plas, it's for you.  sorry to interrupt.  batman. come in. come in.  uh, honey, it's batman.  gotta talk with batman.  uh, very busy.    just as i suspected.  you're missing 2.2 grams of yourself.  hmm. i thought you looked thinner.   wait. what does that even mean.  the robbery at the museum was just a ruse.  rubberneck followed you in there.  it was all a setup to get to you.  but, why, plas.  can you think of anyone who has an ax to grind with you.  hmm.     no. can't think of a soul.  i can.  shh.  hey, 2 bits.   it was him, your honor, or my name isn't eel o'brian.  kite man was behind the whole caper.  i'm going to follow a few leads.  let's do this. no.  kite man is trying to draw you out.  until we know what he's up to, it's best for you to stay here with your family.  oh, ok, bats.   with this piece of plastic man's body, i've decoded his molecular structure and developed a theta ray that will not only affect him, but anyone it hits.  finally, plastic man will pay for those years i spent in prison.  but first, i need an industrial power module to strengthen the beam.  that is your job, rubberneck.  do not fail me.  what was the middle part.   i told you to stay behind.  but we wanted to help.  we.   hiya.  it seems like our friend rubberneck is at it again.  get us to the east side, pronto.  gotcha.    woozy: whoa. whoa.

benjamin franklin.   very good, batman.  where's my family, kite man.  plas. look.   you are one sick individual.  perhaps, but it wasn't always that way.  as a boy, i was obsessed with ben franklin.  i even recreated the famous electricity experiment, but i was brash.  i cut corners, ignored safety precautions.  whaah.   the resulting lightning strike caused a psychological trauma that forced you into a life of kitecentric crime.  ben franklin was a fraud.  what did this socalled great man ever give us.  bifocals.  the franklin stove.  daylight savings time.  never mind.  the only thing that matters is that tonight, i will have my vengeance.  those years in jail kept me from achieving my own greatness, but when people hear how i used a kite for my fiendish revenge, i'll be the most famous kiterelated person in history.  now that i've taken care of any unwanted interference, eel, step out here where i can shoot you more easily.  o'brian, you don't have tobut i do, bats.  thanks to me, my family's in danger.  i have to make this right.   all right, kite man, you win.  of course i do.  my ray will turn you into a petrified statue for my mantel, that is if i don't smash you to bits.   aah.     ok, kite man.  now release the hostages.  as you wish.     raah.   unh.    yaah. unh.  whahh.    .  get away from that.  impossible.   grr.  unh.  yes. i am back, baby.  whoo.  woozy, turn

what happened tolooks like they got a taste of their own medicine.  now, that's what i call a couple of hardened criminals.   animation captioned by the nationalcaptioning institute www.ncicap.org   doc: that's the one.   zak: really.  the "epic of gilgamesh" got taken out of a giant algerian sea centipede's cave by some guy named olaf.   fiskerton:   drew:kingolaf.  and if my source is right, yes.    zak: storm's getting close, dad.  either that or thor, god of thunder, doesn't like us graverobbing from vikings.   doc: we're not graverobbing.  we're graveborrowing.  and if the "epic of gilgamesh" helps us solve our kur problem, i'll risk thor's wrath.  fisk, give me a hand.   both:   drew: that's it.   fiskerton: all right.   zak: whoa.  i guess your source was right.   unfortunately, he was also a big talker.       argost:   ask enough questions about an artifact, and it eventually gets out that you're looking for it.   doc: if you know we're here for the "epic of gilgamesh," then you know why we want it.   hoping to find some magic mumbo cure for kur.   sorry, doc, that's an irrational dream you would have openly mocked six months ago.   doc: six months ago, the secret scientists would never have tried to put a 12yearold boy in a cryogenic deep freeze.   well, i guess things have changed.  ]  doc: move.   zak: nice upgrade.   fiskerton: sweet.   komodo: whoa.   doc: fiskerton, grab komodo.  we can lose them in the trees.   fiskerton:   doc: head for the airship.     zak:    doc: zak.     i've got the boy.   zak:   drew: no.   pull back, dead bolt.  we'll hold the others off.   zak: let me go.   fiskerton:   zak: nice.   fiskerton: you're welcome.   dead bolt, make it rain. )
