  stay well everybody.   you too.  see ya later.   james: cacnea.  fr ndiend and take care.  n to  sarra ar:elfless act a brings jes c'nd aacnea'snd lives together to an end.  and that end is sure to bring new beginnings for each of them, and we'll all be there of being a nogood, bountyhuntin' polecat who tried to bring down the royal flush gang, one jonah hex is sentenced to death.  come noon time, the old station whistle's gonna wail and send these here horses, and you, scattering to the four corners of the west.  any last words.  sure do, but ain't none of them fit to be spoken in front of a lady.      madre mia.  es el bat hombre.   it's time to vamoose. yah.     much obliged to you for saving my hide back there, partner.      well, i suppose you'll be wanting to share the bounty for these here outlaws.  keep it. i fight for justice, not money.  at least take this and get yourself a proper cowboy hat.  i can't be partnering up with someone who parades around in that ridiculous bat getup.   animation heh heh heh. night after night, you return.  surely you must be running out of henchmen.  when will you abandon these foolish attacks.  when you're dead and the totem is in our hands.  then this could be long time.  snack.  finish him.  is that any way to treat your former master.   always biting off more than you could chew, shark.   ..  your wings are so easily clipped.     it's a shame the sun is rising, or we'd finish you off right now.  by the time it sets, the five deadly venoms housed in that dart will do the job for us.  and the last line of defense protecting your precious totem will be gone.    your crime spree just spun you into the slammer, top.   disgraceful.  i know i did not teach you such sloppy form.  master wong fei.  look at you.  such a ridiculous costume for such a powerful warrior.  do you fly with that cape.   you're ill.  never mind me.  your former classmates fox, shark, and vulture seek to control the wudang totem.   with it, they would gain limitless power.  what can i do.  because fox's shadowlcan is vulnerable only to daylight, you must reach wudang temple before they return at sundown.  i'll come, and i'll bring bronze tiger.  do not waste your time with tiger.  he is too fat with pride to ever come to the school's aid.  we'll see you at sundown.  no, you won't.  my journey is complete.  it's all up to you now.  uhh.  heh.   ..  because it was the wudang temple that saved me.  the mantle of the bat. interesting.  wealthy men like fox come to wudang to seek thrills.  or, like tiger, they come with nothing to lose and everything to prove.  why have y y come to my school.  i've lost everything, but i'm trying to find a way to take it back.  very well.  first you must learn the ways of the spirit animal you have chosen.  like the blind bat, you must fight what you cannot see.  come and welcome our new student.   enough.  he said enough.  oh. unh.  nyah. dreadful.  you smile under your mask.  unh.  there is no pleasure in combat.  if it is clown style you seek, go join the circus.  do not help him.  is there nothing you can do correctly.  thanks for the help.  remember it, because that's the last you'll ever get from me.     you done yet.  yeah. you're done.   what a nice surprise.  an old friend just volunteered to be torn apart in the tiger cage.       stay alert.   ha ha. wheeee.  hey, ronald. come on, let's go play.  oh, i wish i could, but i have to go to work.  bye. bye, ronald.  .    okay, here i am at work.  now we can play. woohoo. yay.  . ba da ba ba ba .  whoa. wahahaha.  get in the ring, batman.  i'm not here to fight.  i know. you're here to lose.  fox and his shadowclan are after the wudang totem.  sorry, sounds like wong fei's problem.  wong fei's gone, and we're all that's left to protect it.  i walked away from that world a long time ago.  i watch over my village and no place else.  it's not my fight.  then i'm going to make it your fight.  if i win, you fight by my side, no matter what.  you're living in a fantasy land.  look at that board.  i never lose.   you're outmatched.  maybe, but you left the school before learning wong fei's most important lesson: ..  cheat.   ready to go to fantasy land.  fox joined the legendary shadowclan, who only exist at night.  if they combine their power with that of the totem, they would be unstoppable.  ..  now i remember why i left this place.  come now. let us seeee what you have learned.  attack your master.  if i kill the old man, do i get to keep the temple.  like you need to own anymore buildings in china.   two students, one hand.  ha ha ha. no chance.  hyah.  unh.  no temple for you.  i am old, not deaf.   oh.  be faster. you are bat, not turtle.     your failure was inevitable.  bow before your master.  have i taught you nothing.  the only thing i've learned at this school is that you're a cranky old man who'll never ..  even with perfection.  i'm done fighting for you.  well, well.  if it isn't the prince and the pauper.  kill them both.   secure the totem.  the totem can wait.  it's fox i want.    poor tiger. nothing has changed.  master of martial arts, but not your own pride.  at last, the power of the wudang totem is ours.  hyah.     ..that's what the totem does.     don't let a hungry tummymess you up.   fill it upwith the good stuff.  lunchables,extra cheesy pizza.  lunch

have to catch me firssst.   big news is coming to lucky charms.  com for clues, and more magic.   wong fei could never get you to bow before him.m.  i won't have the same problem.  i bow before no one.  hyah.  unh. aah.   i will let you live.  i want you to walk this earth knowing you had a chance to stop us, to save your village and hong kong, and failed.  this temple is a curse.  i should have never walked back through these gates.   don't look so surprised.  now get in. we're going to hong kong.   we're too late.  he thinks he's gonna take over hong kong with a few mystic mutants.  no, he's going to take over hong kong with a few hundred mystic mutants.  we need to stop fox before he takes over all of china.  then tell me you've got missiles on this thing.   unh.  let's see how you fly without your wings, batman.  brace yourself.  unh. unh.  think you've got one more fight left in you.  sorry, batman.  this time i don't.  what's this. the prideful fool surrenders.  yes.  but only if you promise to spare my people once you rule these lands.  i will, but you must bow down before the greater man.  i've let my pride harm me too many times, but i'll swallow it now if it means protecting my village.  besides, we're outmatched.  and you remember wong fei's most important lesson: ..  cheat.  the totem.       like the blind bat, you must fight what you cannot see.   unh. aah.  aah.   want the totem.  come and get it.      aah.  are you done yet.   aah. aah.   yeah. you're done.  i could get used to this.  wings, blindness, horrendously disfigured face.  i think i prefer my ridiculous costume.  thanks for your help.  i can drop you back at your village.  with wong fei gone, someone has to watch over the temple.  i'm going to bring my people up here and start the wudang school again.  if the shadowclan comes back, they're gonna find an army waiting for them.  wong fei would be honored.  now i think you owe me a rematch.  animation    uhh. uhh. uhh.   come on. where are you.  there she is. the lighthouse.  oh, no.  the light. it's gone.   aah. aah.   captain: man the lifeboats. hurry.  abandon ship. hurry.  ha ha ha. )
