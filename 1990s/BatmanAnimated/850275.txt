you save the world again.  we'll call it "the time my dad saved the " that's my boy.  anima animation captioned by the national captioning institute www.ncicap.org doc: zak is kur.   drew: no.   zak: i'm the bad guy now.  my my parents figure it was the kur stone.   both: no.   zak: my mom was pregnant with me when they dug it up, and there was all this weird energy.  mom.   drew: if the world finds out what you can do, they're going to come after you.   fiskerton:   do we get a peaceful surrender, frankenhair.   zak: who's there.   master.    now that kur has been redeemed, the nagas humbly place ourselves in your service.   zak:.  halfcryptid.   you are all kur.   zak: huh.   and your destiny is set.   drew: get away from my son.   you cannot stop the will of kur, saturdays.  if the boy won't start the war on humanity, the nagas will start itforhim.    argost:    doyle:  i can't believe i agreed to this.   van rook: i know how the mind of v.v. argost works.  he will be near the famous cryptids.  why can't you just shut up and trust me.   doyle: seriously.  you're the one who taught me to lie.   van rook: yes, but only for money.  i don't get paid until you get argost.  why would i lie for free.   doyle: well, then, maybe you're just wrong.  look, we've hit four cryptid hot spots already, and this is the least famous of the bunch.  there is no way argost is  argost:greetings and  van rook: he broke it, he buys it.  okay, we try the next place.   doc: i don't think it's a bluff.  the nagas are going to launch a first strike on the human race.  it's just a matter of where.   drew: it'll have to be a major city.  the nagas will want something big, something to strike as much fear as possible.   doc: they're a semiaquatic species.  we should focus on island cities.  they'd be the easiest to hit by surprise.    drew: that still leaves too many options.  we're going to have to make a very hopeful guess.   fiskerton:   zak: i think they mean me, fisk, butwhyme.   drew: like it or not, youare kur, kiddo.  so, if it were you, where would you hit us.   zak: guys, i don't you heard what the naga said.  what if some part of me actually wants this to happen.  should you really be trusting me.   drew: i'm your mom, zak.  i'm gonna trust you even when it's stupid.   fiskerton:   zak: hong kong.   doc: i'll set the course.   zon:   doyle: cram it, jurassic.  it's switzerland for all of us.   zon:   van rook: tell me how did you end up with the moody one.  you couldn't do any better for a partner.   doyle:   van rook: oomph.  hey. get off.  stop it right now.   zon:   doyle: nope.    zon:   van rook: this is it.  that is basel, home of the legendary basilisk.   doyle: great.  i'll stop for autographs after we hit thelatestdead end.  .  that's just  you know, this is even better than old and rundown.  it'sbugrundown.   van rook: i know these bugs.  these are not good bugs. )
