there are certain nights in your life that are ruled by forces beyond your control magic, romance, destiny nights where love catches you by surprise. and things are never quite the same again. i was lucky enough to have one of those nights. and the memory will stay in my life forever. one of the major international events of 1972 occurred in the hallways of my alma mater. it was of course the recent arrival of oww. inga finnstrom, mckinley high school's first swedish exchange student. can you believe we sent marvin grotsky to venezuela and got her back. unbelievable. it was the greatest trade in the history of the united states. man, if i didn't already have a date i'd ask her to the spring formal. hey, it was just a thought. who're you taking, anyway. ramona storkman. really. that's great, ricky. still, even ramona storkman was better than nothing. you got a date yet, kev. uh, no. nonot yet. i'm still thinking about it. her. you're dreamin'. hey, i was just looking. but face it, who was i kidding. a girl like that. a schlub like me. nothing short of miracle could ever bring us together. until, that is, fate stepped in. fate in the form ofwinnie cooper. triangles can be classified by the length of their sides. a scalene triangle has no equal sideswhile and isoceles winnie was my exneighbor exgirlfriend, exwelljust my ex. and, like all exes, we cared for each other winnie. and used each other for personal gain. i, uh, saw you in the library today. you did. yeah. you were with, uh that new girl, uh what's her name. inga. oh, yeah, that's it. inga. how do you know her, anyway. kevin, do you have the hots for inga. no. no, i justsaw you two, together, and, ii thought it was interesting. that's all. ok. just one more tiny detail and, maybe you couldfix us up. excuse me. well, i just thought that maybe you couldput in a good word for me. youtell her what a nice guy i am and everything. kevin, are you sure she's your type. what's that supposed to mean. what's my type. i don't know, i just thought you'd be going out with someone a little less yeah. swedish. well, yeah. you're right. itit's a stupid idea let's just forget it. whatever you say. fine. after all, no sense beating a dead horse. if it wasn't gonna happen, it wasn't gonna happen. period. kevin, i talked to inga. you did. really. what'd she say. she said she'd like to meet you. yumpin' yiminy. no kidding. and suddenly all bets were on. so, do you, uh, think she'd go to the spring formal with me. i'm not sure, but i do knowthat she doesn't have a date yet. thanks, winnie. i knew i could count on you. what a girl. what an ex. always there for me. no strings attached kevin. just one thing huh. mattstevens. who. you know, the new guy. he's in your history class. you have the hots for matt stevens. no. i just want to meet him. which of course was a reasonable request. still winnie i don't think he's right for you. what do you mean. wellhe didn't even know when the war of 1812 started. kevin, come on you know i'm doing you a favor. and of course, stated that way what choice did i have. i really appreciate this, kevin. hey, no problem. whoa, she's gorgeous. yeah. she's swedish. no, i meant the brunette. oh, yeah, right. hi guys. hey. winnie, this is matt. and this is inga. yep, no doubt about it. thiswas inga. hi. hi. hi. hi. and with those polite formalities out of the way it was time for the main event. time to playthe dating game. so, matt. um, how do you like mckinley so far. well, it's the kind of schoolyou'll never forgetforever. so much for bachelor number one. i know exactly what you mean. hmmm so. inga. are you having fun in america. oh, ja. i like it. yeah. me too. hey, winnie what are your three favorite activities. unbelievable. well, i like to read, i like to play tennisand i love to dance. i love to do all those things, too. ja. me too. oh, what a coincidence. it's amazing. ok, it was clear the time had come to dump the chitchat and get down to brass tacks. hey, winnie would you go to the spring formal with me. sure, i'd love to. great. great. so we'll talk later i gotta get to class. me, too. come on, inga. winnie, wait. oh, yeah. sorry, kevin. hadn't we forgotten something here. inga you wanna go to the dance with me. ja, sure. yes. and with those two words, the deal was sealed. winnie and i were on our way to the spring formal hey, guys. why don't we double. together. double. what do you mean you don't wanna double.. well, i just don't think it's a good idea, that's all. well i don't particularly want to, either. terrific. let's not do it. fine. fine. it's just matt doesn't have a car. why was i surprised. the guy probably couldn't read a stop sign. well, winnie, what if inga and i wanna, you knowbe alone. to talk. kevinmatt and i might want to be alone too to talk. did ya ever think of that. wait a minute. did she know what kind of "talk" we were talking about here. winnie, this is your first date with this guy. well, it's your first date with inga. y'well, that's different. different.. kevin, don't worry, we're not going to cramp your style. it's not a matter of cramping. even though we were cramping all over the place. well, we have to do it, so we might as well be adult about it. fine. fine. and so we did the adult thing. we doubled. me, miss sweden and the guys in the back seat. not that i was resentful about it or anything. so, inga. how do you like school so far. oh, i like history, i like english. i like lunch, hehheh. it was a joke. something funny. so, winnie who are your three favorite movie stars. um well, lemme see never mind. hehheh. oh, i love american music, especially the beatles. really. yeah, me too. hey, remember when the magical mystery tour album came out. i couldn't believe how many kids didn't understand it. what. nothing. no, come on, something must be funny. well, it's justyou didn't understand the album, either. what are you talking about. you didn't even know who the walrus was. well at least i don't buy every donny osmond album that comes out. i don't listen to donny osmond. oh, come on you have that huge poster of him hanging over your bed. it was a phase i went through it was a long time ago it was last year. and there, in a nutshell, you had it. the double date from hell. you know, donny osmond is the kind of the guy you'll never forget forever. boy, it's really crowded here. yeah. really crowded. definitely crowded. by a half hour into the festivities it was clear winnie and i needed to be on separate continents. so, uh, inga. do you wanna get some punch. ja, sure. good idea. let's all get some punch. not that getting away was that simple. matt, don't you and winnie wanna go dance or something. yeah, sure. um winnie. i'd love to. good. so what are your five favorite songs. come on. let's get a drink. and finally, it seemed we were actually gonna have a chance to be alone. get acquainted. just me, inga hey, kev, how's it going. and of course, liberace. paul, this is inga. inga, paul. nice to meet you, paul. yeah, i've seen you around school. you know, i think we have a class next to each other. i'm in history in 306, and you're, what, in english paul. yeah. beat it. oops. gotta go. after all, paul understood. this date belonged to me. the girl, the body, the mind. so, you come from a big city. ja, very big. oh. ornskoldsvik. well, don't you ever get lonely here. ja. sometimes i get lonely. but then, i tell myself, "don't be lonely"and then i'm not lonely. and i guess that's when it hit me. when it came to brains, this chick was a swedish meatball. yeah. hey, guys. hi. how's it going. fine. my only consolation was, she looked worse than me. inga, you wanna dance. ja, sure. if you don't mind, kevin. no. why should i mind. heyi'll even let you dance with winnie. perfect. oh, i'm excited. sure, what the heck. this night was in the toilet anyway. so, what are your four favorite colors. still, in a way it all made kind of sense. so, we gonna dance or not. after all, i'd ruined her evening, she'd ruined mine. we might as well finish this fiasco together. winnie, what's your problem, anyway. i don't have a problem. you have a problem. me. you're the one who keeps taking the shots. well you should hear yourself. you sound so phony. what about you. me. yeah, did matt get your five favorite breakfast cereals yet. very funny. boy, i was mad. boiling. furious. but as we danced, something strange started to happen. matt's a nice guy. yeah, well. inga's nice, too. she's just a littleempty. matt's a real dope. he's not that bad. neither is inga. yeah. she's got nicehair. matt's got nice hair, too. they both have nice hair. like i said something strange. how can i forget, when each face that i see brings back memories, of being with you i just can't go on living life as i do comparing each girl to you knowing they just won't do they're not youooooh you are everything, and everything is you ohoh, you are everything, and everything is you  i should get back. me too. i wasn't exactly sure what had just gone on out there on that dance floor. whatever it was it was crazy. it was confusing. it was dangerous. and i really, really liked it. hey, kev. you going up to the point afterwards. i'm not sure yet. yeah, i know what you mean. i'm not sure, either, i mean you have to kinda play it by ear, cuz you know i knew paul was talking his lips were movingand noise was coming out, butmy mind was elsewhere. suddenly, it was something beyond our control. fate, destiny, magic whatever it was, winnie and i had become two runaway trains, two heatseeking missiles being inexplicably drawn back together. hi. hi. you wanna gotalk. yeah. let's talk. i knew it was crazy. she knew it was crazy. and that car couldn't move fast enough for the both of us. we're here. yeah, we're here. do you think they know we're gone yet. do we care. i can't believe we did this. but we had no choice. it was as if the stars and the universe and destiny had bound us together. winnie. yes, kevin. i'm stuck in your corsage. what. my cuff link is stuck in your corsage. here, let me just try and get it. ok. don't move. huh, no problem. you know, i rememberhearing this story about those kids who when they kissed, their braces got stuck together. andthey had to go to the hospital. you didn't actually believe that story, did you. not until now. there. i can move. good. or, maybe i'll juststay here for a while. you're so cute. you've always been cute. i guess that's why you've been crazy about me since the day we met. i was not. you were crazy about me. you're right. and that's when it happened. at that moment, all the feelings that winnie and i had been trying to bottle up finally came rushing to the surface. we couldn't hide our passions anymore. so i leaned in closerand kissed her right on the eye. and then she kissed meon my eye. what happened. i'm not sure. and the thing is, neither of us knew. maybe our aim was off. or maybe it was something else. i was just thinking about the first time we ever met. yeahyou were wearing thatlittle yellow raincoat, and thatstupid, yellow rain hat. you were soaking wet. wayne told me my folks got me a horse. when i ran outsidehe locked the door. and you came to my house to dry off. yeah. right. so you wanna try that again. i'd like to think about it for a little while. yeahme, too. but the thing is, that was all we did. maybe it was happening too fast. maybe we wanted to hold on what we had. "when a man loves a woman" or maybe we both knew there were other things we had to find, before we found each other. all we really knew for sure was, as we sat there, looking out over the lights of town where we had grown up together, it all felt right. it all feltperfect. havy. co. kr & /min )
