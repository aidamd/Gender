lake wennahatcheefor one week that summer of 1971, my family and paul pfeiffer's rented sidebyside cabins along its placid shores. dammit. it was a place to get away from the aggravations of modern suburban life i got one. escape from the petty everyday competition. jackhoney. hotdogs or hamburgers for dinner. we're gonna have fish, dammit. the kind of paradise that made you wish you could stay forever. paul, let's go. i'm coming. i'm putting on bugspray. well, hurry up. that was me, kevin arnold. and that august there was pretty much only one thing on my mind. paul, come on, let's get outta here. hi, kevin hi, deb. paul, come on. move. where you guys going. none of your business. where we went didn't matter. getting away was all that counted. sayyou boys want to do some fishing. no thanks, dad. after all, we had more important things to do. so, what do you want to do. got me i can't believe it. what happened to this place. used to be great. now look. snoresville. over the summer my best friend had gained two thingsa new set of contact lenses and a new set of hormones. i could be home right now, making time with julie zeller. heh, you're dreaming, pal. and i'd probably gotten to second base by now. oh, right. like you would even know what to do. i know what to do. give me a break. yeah. listen. it just so happens, i got a certain 25cent little insurance policy, huh. the famous pfeiffer condom. paul had been bragging about it ever since he got it in july. paul, not again it was kind of his rabbit's foot. you know douggie sherman. well he picked up about two dozen of these things in a men's room near st. louis. i got mine off him for fifty cents but suddenly, i wasn't listening anymore. "mannish boy" muddy waters oh yeah oh yeahahahaha everything gonna be alright this morning. now when i was a young boy at the age of five my mother said i'd be the greatest man alive here it is. the red chief special. paul, you don't need to rub it in my nose. come on. let's get out of here. sorry we're late. you guys were supposed to be here three hours ago. yeah, well, we uhtook the scenic route, hnnn. tell him, wart. hehehe, we took the scenic route. that was wayne's buddy dave wirtshafter. everybody called him "wart". hard guy to look at. say, i have a fun thought for tonight. how

be joking. ok, so it cost us fifteen bucks. plus gas. at least we'd found a place to hide out for the night. get out. tell 'em, wart. get out. and there you had it. we'd hit bottom. we were stranded. at a drivein with no car, fifty cents in our pockets, and no place to go but"planet of the apes". and then it happened i knew that truck. i knew that girl. and i knew what i had to do. let's go talk to her. are you crazy. we don't even know her. great. mr. condominhiswallet was afraid of locals. look, paul you're the one who said you wanted to meet girls. ok. okall i needed was a snappy opening. you, uhgot another cigarette. sorry. bummed this one myself. oh. you can have a drag on mine if you want. my goal was to appear like i'd been doing this my whole life. you don't smoke, do you. oh. uhsometimes. you shouldn't. it doesn't flatter you. oh.what about you. i shouldn't either. the thing is, for some reason i couldn't breathe. sowhere're you from. here. where, the drivein. about a

girl. and i had no idea where i was going. seemed to me, that was exactly the point. nice night. yeah. that night i felt a million miles from everything i'd known before. i'm starting high school in the fall. me, too. stinks. yeah. maybe things will pick up when i get my license. that's what i'm hoping. a little mobility. you should come up and visit me. i'd like that. the thing is, even though i'd just met this woman, i felt like i'd known her my whole life. hey, cara. you want to go, or you want to hang out awhile. leave us alone, billy. he watches out for you, huh. the guys around here are idiots, you know. yeah. and the summer guysthey're pretty much to stay away from. oh my brother hates that i smoke. do your parents know. sometimes it's like they're speaking a different language. you know. yeahi know. we were so much like each other. i could feel myself missing her. even while i was with her. i'm not supposed to trust you, you know sodo you. yeah. lemme. i thought you were gonna light my cigarette. nice night "so happy together" the turtles yeah. and it was. imagine me and you, i do i think about you day and night it's only right over the next few days, i did my best to
