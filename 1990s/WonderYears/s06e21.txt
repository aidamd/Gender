i guess things never turn out exactly the way you planned. i know they didn't with me. still, like my dad used to say traffic's traffic. you go where life takes you. i remember a time, a place, a particular 4th of july. the things i saw in that decade of war and change. i remember how it was, growing up. among people and places i loved. most of all, i remember how it wasto leave. nineteenseventythree was time of restless energy. the first generation to grow up on "sgt. pepper" was heading out into the world. searching for truth. looking to find themselves. having a blast. me. that july, i was working in my dad's furniture factory. sanding the edges off about 500,000 pieces of wood per day. hey, scrote. pick up the slack, will ya. shut up, wayne. that's no way to talk to your supervisor. you're not my supervisor. if i'm not your supervisor, why am i wearing a jacket and a tie. got me. uhhuh in what has to rate as the dumbest career move in history i'd traded my job at chong's chinese for a future in sawdust. kevin. your checking the machine after every load, right. right, dad. and you're being careful. yeah, dad. the worst part was, for some inexplicably reason, everything my father did irritated the heck out of me. dad, what are you doing. checking the machine. i just told you. i checked it. i heard ya. and viceversa. well then, why'd you ask me in the first place. what'd you say. i didn't say anything. alright, let's just get back to work pay attention to what you're doing. i always pay attention. ahha. face it. nothing was going right my job, my future, my family not to mention the last night i'd spent with my girl. this song is really stupid. i mean, what is someone gonna to do kiss an envelope or something. yeah, i guess so. winnie, are you sure you want to do this. wellit's a good job. what being a lifeguard at some stupid resort. kevin, my uncle went through a lot of trouble to get me this job. besides, what's wrong with being a lifeguard. wnothing. it's just you're gonna be so far away. and. . course, what i wanted to say was how much i'd miss her. it's gonna be just so inconvenient. inconvenient.. who's stupid idea was this anyway. i think it was yours. mine.. you were the one who said that we should spend the summer finding ourselves. i didn't say that what i meant was we should find ourselves but, you know, still be together. uh, keep our space, only not really. yeah, that was it, in a nutshell. kevin, do we have to argue. this is our last night together. i'll think about you every minute. and, well, putting it that way me too. what was i worried about. we'd think about each other every minute. i have to start looking for bathing suits. kevin. kevin, i told ya to pay attention. oh well, so my plans for summer had turned to carpenter's glue. at least i still had my loyal friends. we're leaving. what.. we're driving crosscountry. we take off in three days. you're kidding. well, we're going to new york, then new orleans, and thensan francisco. why don't you come with us. yeah. what do you say, kev. oh, come on, man we'll be out on the road. we'll be living by our wits. go where we want to go. do what we want to do. if we want to wake up in kansas city we'll wake up in kansas city. think about it and faced with the call of the open road, the song of the highway, the lure of total irresponsibility you're dreamin'. your parents are never gonna let you go. there was really only one reply. i'm in. you're out. what do you mean. it'll be a great trip. now, where are they going exactly. new york, new orleans, san francisco. san francisco. don't forget to put some flowers in your hair. look, dad, i just don't think you understand. i mean this trip will be good for me i'll be out on my own. forget it. why. you wouldn't survive two seconds on your own. oh, yeah. what are you gonna live on. hey, i got money saved up. and besides, we'll be living on our wits. oh, brother. you know, honey, karen's gonna be flying in on the fourth of july weekend, and i thought it would be a good chance for us all to be together. look. there's no sense in discussing this any further. you're not going, and that's final. jeez, what was this a family or a firing squad. ok. see, i don't know why i asked you anyway. this is my life, and it's my decision. ok. and i'm gonna do what i have to do. and so, three days later, i got up at dawn. hey, thanks for letting us use your sleeping bag. no problem. to say goodbye to my friends. hey. we'll send you a postcard from new orleans. you're gonna have a great time. nah, come on, it won't be that good. yes it will. i keep thinkin' were gonna meet these two girls, and they're both gonna fall in love with me. hnnn. good luck. we're not eatin' till st. louis. seeya. it came down to this i'd been stranded buried in the bluecollar brigade. winnie kevin, is everything ok. yeah. yeah, i just wanted to talk to you. i really miss you. well, i really miss you, too. you do. of course i do. yeah.  that's what i needed a loving voice, a sympathetic ear. how's the job. great. it is. well, pretty good. you know i still have a lot to learn here. oh. that's good. i'm really happy for ya. so, how's things with you. well hey, winnie. winnie. you know, working for my dad isn't exactly come on, cut it out. winnie, come on. winnie. come on, stop splashing. what's going on. oh, it's nothing, kevin. i have to get back to my job, ok. oh, uh, yeah, sure work. i'll talk to you soon. well, sure, i just hoped great. just great. and i don't know maybe it was winnie, or the noise, or the heat, but at that moment, i felt like i was going to burst. i don't believe it what are you doin' here. i was just makin' a phone call. you're supposed to be out there working. i can't leave you for one minute. what's your problem. what was that.. dad, get off my back. what.. you're on top of me every second, telling me how to run my life. "do this, don't do that" i hate this job. what's goin' on here. you know what your problem is. yeah. i can't stand it here. uhuh. you think you're to good for this job. and that's when it happened. i looked at those guys, and all i saw was mediocrity and hard work. and being chained down the rest of your life. yeah, that's right. that's right. maybe this job is good enough for you. but it's not good enough for me. fine. you don't want to work here i don't want ya here. and after seventeen years of living under my father's thumb oki quit. i'm outta here. that next morning i took my life savings of a hundredandthirty bucks, and packed my bag. honey. i wish you wouldn't do this. i gotta go. well, you really don't, you know. you can just put that bag away i gotta be on my own. i gotta find myself. i know, but you can find yourself here. people don't realize it, but there's lots of places you can find yourself. i mean you can go into a restaurant, lost, not knowing what you're doing. then all of a sudden you can find yourself. it was wise, and touching, and kind all at once. it can happen anywhere. it came from the heart of the woman who'd loved me, and raised me. and i could only think of one thing to say. mom, i gotta get goin'. i'll call when i get someplace. all i knew was, i was seventeen, and on my way. i was gone and i didn't look back. freedom. it was more than just a full tank of gas, and a highway under my wheels. it was me on my own. with no one to answer to but the call of summer. and fun. not that i'd taken off without a plan. i knew where i was going. welcome to the cascades will you be staying. take care of my car. yeah, it's a classic. never mind that. this was perfect fresh air, sunshine, and of course winnie. winnie. kevin. i can't
