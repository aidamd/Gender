gonna|come up in a few minutes. i just want you to see alright, this was the ticket. a place where things got done. you can see the position of|their property, in regard to this project. you could almost hear the wheels of|democracy turning. it's seventyfive thousand|dollars. it's just a typo. now, charles. we got|i think everybody got this. we got a letter from|mr. and mrs. carol the energy report indicates|that the current installation doesn't necessarily, uh of course, some wheels take|longer than others. some other things we|need to talk about. kevin arnold.|here i see that you would like to|speak about harper's woods. well, the floor is yours. cool your statement, mr. arnold. i i came here tonight because i have something to say. there's a little piece of land,|not far from here. a place called|harper's woods. ya might have passed it|on your way here or there. it's not much to look at. a few acres of trees,|some boulders a couple squirrels|and some birds. but there's something|you didn't see, i'll wager. something you can't see. cuz there's something|in those woods that you can't see|with your eyes you have to look|with your heart. it's my childhood. and his and hers ours is a world too careless|with its memories. please, i beg of you don't take our childhood. hey. kevin's right.|what's wrong with us. order. order. |may we have order, please. this is highly irregular. i mean it now. order. order. everything's in order this meeting is adjourned. what. wait, wait.|we have something to say. well, of course you do but, perhaps you'll come|back next week. next week. somehow, i didn't think|we had that long. you fell asleep first. i didn't. |i think you did, kevin. winnie, i did not fall|asleep first. something was happening to us. did so just when we needed each|other the most paul and winnie and i were|falling apart. we should pour sand|down the gastanks of those bulldozers. winnie. please talk about stupid.|don't call her stupid. i can speak for myself,|kevin. yeah.|shut up, paul. you shut up.|i don't need this. i don't either. great. all we wanted was|for someone to listen. now we weren't|even listening to each other. it wasn't fair. men with bulldozers,|parents planning commissions|that meet at four a. m. it made you wonder. |were they in this together. yeah, that was it. |them against us. just one big heartless assistant principal. whoa. halt. is that the way we turn blind|corners in school corridors. no, sir well then, suppose you|go back around the corner and show me|the proper way to do it. what. now. like i said:|"them against us. " hey, bud.|get off my back. rule number one of|junior high school. for every action there's a reaction. we seem to have|a problem here, kevin. you agree. rule number two. |avoid trick questions. i'm not sure sure, sir. well. . we do. i've been watching you, kevin. i see things|i hear and, in this case, i think|i know what the problem is. sure i think i know|what's bothering you. you do. and just for a second i almost liked the guy. you think you're special. just for a second, though. i've been assistant principal of|this school for over twenty years. and in that time i've seen people like you|come and go every single year. hundreds of 'em. |maybe thousands. you walk the halls,|you go to class and then you're gone. |just like that. gone with the wind. i'm gonna leave you to|think about what i've said. and when you think|you understand you can go. |i'll be outside amazing. |was this guy joking. "gone with the wind". |that's a movie, right. sure, i'd think about it,|for about one nanosecond. and then a funny thing|happened. i started to think about it. who were all those people. did anyone know.|did anyone remember. it was weird. sitting there in the middle|of a crowded school i suddenly felt|completely alone. ii didn't do that. did i. rule number three. never write something|you can't erase. you're grounded, buster. you hear me.|no parties no friends. you're grounded. nice goin', dorkface. it was a real dumb stunt. |wayne. wayne was right. the fact was, i wasn't sure|myself why i'd done it. except that nothing seemed|permanent, anymore. harper's woods|paul and winnie our friendship. what'd it all mean. grow up, butthead. well, there ya had it|in a nutshell. the plain, unvarnished truth. it was time for me to stop|acting like a child. it was time to face facts. |it was time to take a walk. that night, i went to say|goodbye to harper's woods. remember when we|carved those. yeah. third grade. i thought it was|second grade. no, it was fourth grade,|i remember it distinctly. well, one of those grades. we heard about what|you did in diperna's office. pretty stupid. really stupid. ok, i'm stupid. can you just|forget about it. kev. we have a plan. it just might work. really.|see, first we chain winnie to|the bulldozer. what. well, ya see,|it works better if it's a girl. are you crazy. and then tomorrow,|when they try to start it up paul.|we will you stop it. well, what.|well, i mean in the first place,|it's not gonna work. and they're just gonna cut|that thing with boltcutters, then you'll be out|twofifty for a new lock. and in the second place|winnie's gonna get in trouble. if she doesn't|freeze to death, first. and in the third place it doesn't matter. well look around. it's just a vacant lot. in a couple of years,|we won't even remember. i guess i wanted paul and winnie|to face the facts, too. wasn't gonna be easy. maybe growing up never is. one two three four five six what is she doing.|seven you better get going. forget it.|come on. i'm not gonna do this. i'm only gonna count to twenty. |eight let's go, come on. maybe every human soul|deals with loss and grief in its own way. let's go. some curse the darkness kevin. twelve thirteen yes. some play hideandseek. fifteen sixteen that night,|paul and winnie and i found something|we'd almost lost. we found our spirit. |the spirit of children. the bond of memory. and the next day they tore down|harper's woods. )
