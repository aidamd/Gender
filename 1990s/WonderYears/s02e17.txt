movie info: 25. 0fps| ever since i could remember, the cooper's|annual barbecue had been the first event|of summer. it was a neighborhood tradition,|the herald of good times. japanese lanterns|glowed in the dusk. and warm breezes carried the smell|of burgers sizzling on the grill, and the sounds of kids having|the time of their lives. but maybe the best thing about it|was that it happened the first week of|summer vacation. one day after the last day of school. it was kind of a solemn moment. eight months of|relentless education were finally erupting|in a blast of summer madness. winnie. is this great or what. what's the matter. well, i think i'm gonna|kinda miss it. leave it to winnie cooper to|get all sentimental about things. you had to love her. figuratively speaking of course. so, sign my yearbook. sure. and, maybe i could sign yours. give it back to me fourth period. |gotta go. yep, you could feel it in|the air. hope, potential who knew what the summer|breeze might bring. sign my yearbook. sure. we really had a great year,|don't you think. yeah. there was one|minor problem here. i didn't have the slightest|idea who this girl was. i had to think fast. "have a neat summer. " ok, it was cheap. |but it did have a certain flair. "boats against the current,|borne back ceaselessly, into the past. " let's face it. no one could press pages|quite like miss white. did you feel the sensual power of|fitzgerald's imagery. yes. yes. hello. ok, so maybe she was|a little old for me this year. now, before the bell rings but, heck, just the other day ii coulda sworn i felt|a whisker coming in. i have an|announcement to make. so, maybe, just maybe,|next year. i'm in love with|kevin arnold. and i don't care|who knows it. oh, kevin. miss white. yes, kevin. what did you say. i said, i'm getting|married this summer. and when i come back next year, you'll all be calling me mrs heimer. heimer. heimer. what kinda name was that|for miss white. class.|can you say "heimer". heimer. oh, well. maybe part of|loving is learning to let go. four more hours, one lunch|period, and a few arias were all that stood|between me, paul, and summer. i wasn't gonna let|anything ruin that. got your bike ready. ok, so tomorrow morning we have|to get my tent out of the garage. yep, i could feel it now. |the wind in our faces, the open road ahead,|our knapsacks on our backs. i can hardly wait.|can you. we gotta talk. in the history of mankind, no good has ever come|from those four words. what do you mean|you're going away.. how come you never|said anything. well, the schwartzes|kept changing their minds. the who. the people we're sharing|the cabin with. and, look,|it's not that bad. we'll only be there|until labor day. paul, that's the whole summer. no, you see,|not technically. the summer officially goes until|september twentyfirst. paul. ok, the whole summer. anyway, i'm gonna|have a lousy time. oh, yeah.|where you going. lake cohasset. so basically you'll be|swimming, fishing, sailing, and waterskiing. i guess. paul, why don't you|just admit that you're gonna have|a great time. i was asking for the impossible. |i'd have to try another tack. ok, tell me one thing|that's gonna make it lousy. i had him on the ropes. mosquitoes. what.|yeah, are you kidding. with all that standing water. do you have any idea|how many diseases are transmitted by mosquitoes. the man was a master. well, at least we'll have|the barbecue tomorrow night. yeah, sure. except i'm|leaving tomorrow afternoon. well how about tonight then. i gotta pack. i was mad. mad at paul|how could he do this to me. he was ruining my summer. wait a minute,|i still had winnie. winnie wasn't the type to|up and leave you, she wouldn't pull a stunt|like that, she was thoughtful. look at her mulling over what to write|in my yearbook, carefully choosing|her words. wait a second,|this was serious mulling. something was definately|going on here. sure, we'd had our ups|and downs, our missteps but we were older, wiser. it was time to let her|know how i felt. it was time to make poetry. no matter what the obstacles. there. i had filled an entire|page with phrases like: "never change", "always stay the|same", and "good luck. " still something was missing. it needed something more. |something ok, it was a bold and|reckless move, but i was a bold and|reckless guy, and these were bold|and reckless times. i'm finished. i tried not|to hog up too much space. me, too. here's yours. well, i'll see you later. yeah, see you later. i couldn't wait another second. to read all those|wonderful things winnie had been too embarrassed|to say in person. all those secret passions,|and yearnings she'd kept bottled up|inside for the past year. "have a neat summer". i hadn't even left|school grounds, and already my summer|vacation was a bust. hey, kevin, it's|starting to clear up. don't you wanna get|dressed, and do something. it wasn't fair. |i was doing something. i was hiding out. well the barbecue|tonight'll cheer you up. i don't think i'm gonna go. |what. why. i just don't feel like it. wild horses couldn't|drag me to that party, not after i'd made|a total fool of myself all over winnie cooper's|yearbook. i just wanna stay home, ok. i think you should go. mom. |honey, they're expecting us. it really means a lot to them. |especially this year. mom.|kevin you're gonna go,|that's all there is to it. ok. great, first my best|friend walks out on me, now i have to die of|embarrassment in front of thousands of|partygoers. i couldn't take it. why can't we go on vacation. maybe next summer. well it's not fair. |i have nothing to do. what was that. i'm not exactly sure,|but i believe he said, "i have nothing to do. " "nothing to do". all right, start in the corner,|you clean out the junk, then you work|your way to the center. then you sweep it out,|and hose it down. that's all.|after that we'll see about the attic. well, so much for|madcap vacation plans. i had finally hit bottom. hi, kevin. what are you doing here. i was just taking a walk. it's a little hectic|at my house right now. do you need any help with this. no, that's ok. |i can handle it. it's part of my|"really neat summer". "oh". i'm dying of embarrassment|and she gives me "oh". well maybe we can talk about|it tonight. at the party. yeah, well i don't|think i'm gonna be there. boy, now she was|really makin' me mad. well. did you|show it to anybody. show what. well, the yearbook. you know|what i wrote. yeah, well you can just|forget about it, ok. 'cause i didn't mean|a word of it. you can just rip out the page and throw it|in the garbage because it was amazing. it was our first kiss since that|day last fall in harper's woods, the day winnie's|brother brian died. i'd been waiting to kiss her|again all year. and now that it had happened,|i felt as confused as ever. there was only one thing|i was sure of i was a man on fire. welcome to my summer of love. there was the usual|crowd of people at the cooper's that evening. but to me, it was strictly|a twoperson affair. hi. |hi. what do you say after a kiss. what's that smell. it smells like a saddle. i guess it's|my aftershave lotion. really.|yeah. well, i mean, i didn't actually|shave, i just, sorta, put it on. ii can go wash it off|no, that's ok. so, wanna sit down. winnie. can you take this to my dad. sure. |thanks. ok, so she was busy,|that was understandable. after all, it was|her parents' party. hi, mr. cooper. ok, so everybody was busy. no problem,|the evening was young. mr. ermin would|like to talk to you. oh my gosh, mr. ermin. |the genghis khan of lawn care. he had a lawn the|size of wyoming. i understand you're|looking for work, son. this evening was|heading nowhere and fast. winnie. hi. do you wanna take a|walk with me somewhere. i can't, i have to help out. come on, only for a minute. winnie, would you take|these to your father. mom, i'm changing the records. honey, please. i'll change the records. don't mention it. |just here to help. in the course of the next hour, i watched winnie wear a groove|in the patio between her parents. there was only|one possible explanation she was avoiding me. wait a minute. hi. yeah, we'd already said that. listen|did you have a burger. winnie, are we gonna have|some time alone or not. winnie. ok, i promise, in a|few minutes. i gotta go. five burgers and three hot dogs|later, i was finally fed up. she wasn't helping her parents,|she wasn't doing anything, she was just standing there. ok, enough was enough. the game was over,|let's lay out the cards. what is with you, huh.. one minute you like me and|then the next minute you don't. first you kiss me, and then, you|act like you don't even know me. you've been doing this all year. i mean, if you like me,|then say so. but if you don't then don't|act like you do, ok. ok. kevin, i have to|go away this summer. what. with my mom. we're going to|my aunt's in maine. i don't believe this. i mean,|what about my summer. paul's going away|with his parents and now you're going|away with your mom and and then, for the first time|that night, i looked around. the music was playing,|couples were dancing. holding each other tight. but not everybody. and suddenly|i began to understand. i wanted to tell winnie|i understood what was happening to her family. i wanted to say something|that would give her comfort. something incredibly wise. sorry. will you write to|me when i'm away. sure. i miss my brother. yeah that summer, kids everywhere|swam, waterskied, and sailed while winnie cooper struggled|to keep her head above water, in a family torn apart|by anger, and grief. i pretty much|stayed close to home. i mowed mr. ermin's lawn. |i went fishin' with my dad. i watched a man|walk on the moon. i considered myself|pretty lucky. revised by taurus mind )
