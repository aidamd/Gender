in nineteenseventytwo the "me" decade was dawning. and people everywhere were doing their own thing. letting it all hang out. and setting out to find themselves. the world waschanging. and my family was right in the middle of it. so, what do you think. it'snice honey. yeah. we got a real deal on it. michael's gonna paint it and fix it up. aren't you, michael. uh, yeah. sure. wellwhatever you dodon't get rid of the mattress back here. face it. the arnold family was undergoinga radical shift. everybody comfortable. we were in a period of readjustment. a state offlux. after all, after twelve months of turmoil, we were back together again. there was, of coursea reason. ah, the lovely bride and groomtobe. my sister was getting married. at last. i'm always pleased to bring together a man and wife. you meanman and woman. well, of course. not that it was gonna be simple. when it came to my family, nothing ever was. so what kind of a ceremony do we have in mind. well, we haven't reallytalked about it, but we thoughtsomething simple. but, traditional. we did. you knowsomething with flowers, and musicand hymns not too formal, butkind ofelegant. of course the whole thing was stillin the planning stages. uh, mom. uh, michael and i were actuallythinking of something a little less. well, that's ok, honeywhatever you want. goodgood, good. we don'thave to have the hymns. excellent. now when shall we schedule our premarital counselling sessions. premarital counselling. what is this. the stoneage. it was a classic case of apples and oranges. well, honeymaybe we can find another church. you don't understand. i don't want my wedding in some musty old chapel. well, thenhow about somethingunitarian. trouble was, the oranges seemed to be winning. i don't believe this. / but, honey mom mr. arnold. do you think you could / ah. don't ask me i just pay the bills. this is going great, so far don't you think. / mmmmm. i know what you mean. you want me to talk to him. no. it doesn't make sense. why can't we just get marriedand go on with our lives. yeah. but even i knew enough about weddings to know they weren't about getting married. done. it's beautiful don't ya think. it's gorgeous, mom. it's also yours. what do you think, jack. well don't ask himhe just pays the bills. and there ya had it. between dad's wallet and mom's goodintentions now let's try the veil. things were getting a tad out of hand. michael. you're not supposed to see the bride in her wedding dress. mom he's seen me naked. so, michaelhow are things going up at the house. oh. well, i've just about finished up the carpentry work. sothe owner's gonna try to sell it. you mean ya gotta move out. what are ya gonna do for a job. well, i've been looking around. for other work. in fact, we've actually. . we've been meaning to michael. now, it was pretty clear something was up, here. something big. why haven't you told us. and as usualmom nailed it. well cause if you two need a place to stay you can stay with us. uhoh jackmaybe you could check for openings at norcom what. uhhh and that's when the lid blew off. mother, no. i can't do this. ii can't wear this dress and i can't have this kind of wedding. we have to do it our own way. can't you understand that.. and finallythe truth had been told. thisisn't what you want. and with that, the great arnold prenuptial crisisof nineteenseventytwo passed into history. this must be a relief, huh. how. i mean, making your own plans. having the wedding at your house, and all. heck. seemed to me, the lines of communicationhad been firmly reestablished. karen. you ready.. i'll be right there. in fact, the only one who didn't seem convincedwas the groomtobe. michael. you ok. can you keep a secret. well yeah. i got a job. wellthat's great. and it was. at least i thought it was. there's just one thing. it's in alaska. alaska. ok, michael. i'm ready. bye, kev. / yeah. ready. and right about then i knew for sure what i should have guessed all along. take care. we weren't gaining an inlaw bye. we were losing a family. that weekend we set off for the first marriage in my family's brief history. you know, jack maybe it's better that karen's having the kind of wedding she really wants. i think so. little did my parents know their only daughter was about to be whisked away to an igloo, in theland of the midnight sun. do you have the check, honey. right here. check. what check. for karen and michael. a little wedding gift. how much is it. / never mind. it's for a down payment when they find a house. but as much as i wanted to stay out of this i knew somebody had to break the news. mom. dad. listen. / yeah. aboutkaren and michael. what about 'em. great gift. it just didn't seem like my place to tell them. and so, we arrived. well. this is it. i justhope this whole thing is legal. oh, don't worry, honey. karen said she found an ordained minister. yeah ahwelcome, welcome. to the happiness and joy that was and is to be. yes. ahhhh, yes. your aura is one of paternal love. it is a very strong vibration. clearly, we werein new territory, here. karen's mother. so like the fountain springs of *kalu*. thank you. brotherly love. positive supportive vibrations. very good. yeah nice to meet you. let's put it this way and these are my friendsrainbow and wind. my family. we were kinda like strangers in a strange land. it'snice to meet youwind. no, no. i'm rainbow. this is wind. oh, yeah. and this is butthead. still, that afternoon a funny thing started to happen. little by littlewe were drawn in to karen's world. for the first time in a long time. mom and dadactually smiled. i mean really smiled. maybe there was a reason. maybe it had to do withfamily. hey. still, by around four o'clock hey. i was beginning to feel time running out. it's a great party. yeah. ok i'd never been real good with interpersonal dialog with my sister. so i figuredapproach this sensitively. so, when are you gonna tell 'em. mom and dad. about alaska. oh. . i mean, what are ya gonna do. ssend 'em a postcard with apolar bear on it. no, i justi haven't found the right moment, yet. besides you know how they are. and that was the problem. unfortunately, i did. that night, we joined together to celebrate the next day's wedding. sure, maybe it wasn't exactly the kindof bash my parents had in mind. but in its own funky way it wasclassic. the food is wonderful, michael. oh, thanks, mrs. arnold. yep the grub is great. you'll have to teach me these recipes, honey. sure still, i couldn't help noticing the bride looked a littlenervous. momlisten excuse mebut i have something i have to say. uhya knowthis has been a heck of a day. i mean seein' the way you live and meetin' your friends i guess we never really had the time before but i hope that can change, now. you know i don't know when you grew up, karen but we're very proud of the way you did. and, michael norma and i both feelluckythat you're joining our family. all in all, it may have beenthe best speech dad ever made. sowe, um we have a little somethingto help you get started. and that's when it happened. /ok, come on of course, it all seemed innocent enough. what's this. / it's homemade. oh, jack. isn't that lovely. and it was. a work of art. a creation of joyand celebration. i think we all saw it at about the same moment. "alaska or bust". honeywhat's that mean. uhbut karen's facesaid it all. i don't understand. stillit was pretty clearshe did. mom mr. arnold. . somehow dad. it was just too littletoo late. i wasn't quite sure what to say. i didn't mean for you to find out this way. when were you gonna tell us. i don't know. tonight. now. i justi didn't want to spoil everything. karen. we're your parents. don't you think we have a right to know. mom. this doesn't change anything. michael and i have a life. you have to let us go. in a way, it was a plea. from a child who'd grown up and who's parents could never understand. know what i remember. i moved you a thousand miles away from home. look, honey if you have to leavewe're not gonna stop you. but where ever you are we will never, everlet you go. karen. they, uh want us, outside. "he is now to be among you" "at the calling of your hearts" "rest assured this troubador" "is acting on his part" karen and michael, it is a joyous journey you begin today the next morningi watched my sister get married and welcomed a new brother into my family. your children are not your children. they are the sons and daughters of life's longing for itself. you may house their bodies, but not their souls. for their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow for life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday. i watched my mother send her firstborn child out into the world. and felt her sorrow. and her joy. and who brought karen into being and now presents her to be united with michael. her mother and i. i watched my father give away his only girl to a stranger he hardly knew. i said goodbye, myself. although they are separate, they will always be together. we are as one. one pain, one joy. one coming together, for all our lives. one dream of tomorrow. it is more than love. it is life. one life. one being. together. looking back, maybe it all seems a little silly. but being there, in those passing moments i saw that something real and important was happening. not just for michael and karen but for all of us. in our small and fragile, almostinsignificantsuburban family. after all, those werepassionate times when children were pioneers on the road to find out, wherever that road might take them. when brothers and sisters, looking back wished they'd known each other better. what are you doin' out here. i don't know nice night. yeah. which way is alaska, anyway. that way. i think. sounds like a pretty good place, huh. yeah. and parentsfilled with love and despairheld on to the past and kept a quiet vigil, for the future. )
