movie info: 25. 0fps| when paul and i|were little kids we had our birthdays only|four days apart. come to think of it,|we still have our birthdays only four days apart. but i guess birthdays aren't as big a part of life|as they used to be. man, we had|some classic parties. year after year we reached|from manhood together. when we fell short we fell short together. god, we couldn't|wait to get older. so what the hell's a|bar mitzvah, anyways. it's a ceremony when|you become a man, stupid. a man. pfeiffer. that's got to be the funniest|thing i've heard all day. you're just jealous. |yeah, you're just jealous. jealous. why.|because you get to wear one of those little beanies|on your head. it's called a yarmulke. and for your information,|it happens to be a very big deal. i get to stand up in front of|all my friends and my whole family|and say prayers and make this big speech|and stuff. a speech. a speech. well now i'm jealous,|now i'm jealous. and then we have|this huge party. i've heard of those|pfeiffer parties. very hot catered, all you can|eat and drink and hundreds of guests and|all the girls i want to invite. make sure you keep 'em|on a leash, now. and a band. a live band.|and tons of presents. well, if you figure|a hundred people and they each bring one you're really gonna get a|hundred presents. yeah, of course. and that's not|including the money. like how much money. it's not said 'em out,|but i say maybe a thousand bucks. did he say|a thousand bucks. you gotta be crazy,|i'm not gonna pay that. well, let me talk to a mechanic. yeah, yeah, i'll hold. so what are you and paul gonna do|for your birthday this year. nothing, i guess. paul's having his bar mitzvah. it's not that|i was jealous of paul. it's not that i was|feeling sorry for myself. it's just maybe there was a minibike|in this for me somewhere. that's right, i forgot. well, what are we gonna do|about your birthday. i don't know. well, it has to be|something good. you're turning thirteen,|it's a big one. i guess. just not the same|without paul, huh. either that,|or it's just not the same without a hundred|presents and a live band. aw, honey. ok. good, good. ya got her right|where you want her. now hit her with|the trump card. well, i'm not sure i even|want to do anything this year. the martyr routine. i mean, unless some|five hundred dollars. since when does an alternator|cost fivehundred dollars. what the hell does a|transmission got to do with this. like i was saying unless we could do like a|look just don't touch my car,|alright. leave it just like you found it.|i'll be right down. better grab your coat, i'll need|a ride down to the garage. don't worry, honey. we're gonna do something fun|for your birthday. right, jack.|yeah. how about we get kevin a brand|new alternator for his birthday. have some more chicken,|kevin. i made it especially for you. that's right, that's why|it's called chicken kievin. dinner at the pfeiffer's. |it was always an experience. ok, kevin what's that say. alvin pfeiffer, optometrist. i was the only person he knew|with 2020 vision. he loved me. ketchup. |incredible. what a kid, huh.|what a kid. al, leave him alone, he's eating. |some more potatoes, kevin. ida pfeiffer,|mom extroardinaire. i think i was the only|person she knew who really liked her scalloped|potatoes. she loved me. debbie, don't slouch, and|get your elbows off the table, please. |i just put that down fresh. debbie pfeiffer,|paul's little sister the only girl|i ever knew to whom i was her concept of|the ideal male form. she really loved me. great chicken, mrs. pfeiffer. chicken. |that reminds me of a story. and grandpa pfeiffer. he had a thousand stories,|and i was the only person who hadn't heard|them all a thousand times. and so, of course kevin. |when i was your age he loved me. like my grandson,|to your right, i too, had a bar mitzvah. cousin heshy, cousin moshe,|and myself. and we were very poor so all these fancyshmancy gifts|that you kids get today they weren't around. so do you know, what i got|for my bar mitvah. my entrance into manhood. a chicken|that's right. a chicken. it doesn't sound like much, but|in those days it was like gold. so i took this chicken and i put him on some hay|outside the school. and i started on my baruch. i was very, very nervous,|let me tell ya. sweat pouring from every|part of my body. i was standing up there,|doing my thing in walks the chicken. right in front of the beema. sits down starts to cluck.|and "pop". out pops an egg. you must have been|really mad. mad. no, no. |i had no right to be mad. it was my bar mitzvah gift,|and as my father always said never look a gift chicken|in the mouth. my family is so weird. oh, this is a great occasion. my family's here,|my grandson's friend is here. so, paul, tell me|yeah. you studied hard.|yeah. you know all your prayers. then i have something for you. i wondered what it would be. money. stock options.|his own car. the prayer book that i used|to deliver my baruch. on that fateful night|of the chicken. my grandfather gave it to me. and tonight|i wish to give it to you. pop he'll get|stains all over it. can't this wait until we|cleaned the table at least. no. it cannot. my grandson you are on the verge of|becoming a man. you are about to inherit|the love, the joy, the bitterness of our people. |their tradition. from my grandfather,|to my father to me, to my son and now to you. maseltov. maseltov. maseltov. |maseltov. twothousand bucks for a|'66 impala. that's a joke. maybe it was the glow of|the halfglass of manishewits but i felt a sudden|rush of family pride. i mean, my family had a rich|tradition, too. all i had to do was figure|out what it was. dad. where's grampa arnold from. look at that. |highway robbery. what'd ya say. i said, where did|grampa arnold come from. newark. ya know, one of these days|i'm just gonna get rid of the damn cars, and|we'll all take the damn bus. well. like i was saying mom. yeah. i was just thinking|about something. i don't know. see, i was over at paul's house|tonight for dinner and see grampa pfeiffer was telling|all these stories about his bar mitzvah, and|when he lived in russia and everything. |and i started thinking|about our family, and i is it some kind of law, that they had to run|the garbage disposal at critical moments of|psychological development. mom.|yeah. ii was just asking you about|where our family came from. i mean what are we. what are we. yeah, you know|like, paul's jewish and winnie's irish,|so what are we. oh, well gosh, kevin that's kinda hard to|well, well lemme see. jack's mother is italian,|well, actually she's half italian cuz her mother's|romanian, and then his father's polish|i'm pretty sure about that. and then my greatgrandfather|came over from scandinavia. came over a long time ago|and married my greatgrandmother whose parents were welsh. but of course,|she grew up in ohio before they|moved to detroit. and as my mother tried to|put together the strands of our old and|faded family tree i came to realize what|so many american's do in search of their roots. or was it norway. i was a mutt. so the invitations are|going out today. here, i forgot. i have one for you. special delivery.|thanks. there's gonna be|so many babes at this thing you wouldn't believe it.|i'm inviting sandy mcclouskey, jodie hart|and christine capone. and i'm gonna make sure|the band plays plenty of slow songs. please share our joy,|as our son paul joshua,|is called to the torah on saturday, march eight wait a minute. it's on the eighteenth. well, yeah,|i thought you knew that. yeah, but that's my birthday. yeah, i know, but yyou didn't tell me it|was on the eighteenth. yes, i did.|it's supposed to be on the first saturday after i|turn thirteen. i told you that. yeah, but|i didn't realize i didn't pick for it to be on|that day or anything. it's just that's when it's|supposed to be. i know i mean i'd changed|if i could, but you know|it's like really important. it's like|is a tradition. you're not mad, are you. well no, i'm not mad,|it's just ii'm not gonna be able|to come, is all. you're not. well, no. i mean,|my parents have this whole big huge thing|planned for my birthday. not even for the ceremony. well, paul,i can't help it|if you're having your stupid bar mitzvah|on my birthday. i mean, i'm really sorry|to tell you this but you're not the center of|the whole stupid world. happy birthday to me wrench. no, not the crescent,|the threequarter. here kevin, honey.|paul's on the phone, again. tell him i'm busy.|it's the third time he called. well, i don't want to talk to him,|i'm helping dad. i guess the old guy must have|sensed something was wrong. go ahead, dad, ask: "i haven't seen paul around|lately, you two having a fight, or something." screwdriver. ok, so he didn't sense it. i mean, what did i expect.|the man wasn't a mindreader. i'd just tell him|what was bothering me. we aren't really talking to|each other these days. paul and me we aren't really|talking to each other. so, you know, i'm not going to|be going to his stupid bar mitzvah. ya don't say it's on the same day|as my birthday. my thirteenth birthday. |can you believe it. i mean,|the whole point of a bar mitzvah|is so dumb, anyways. i mean, he's only|thirteen years old, and everyone's|telling him he's a man. now that's really stupid. i mean, he's just a little kid,|don't you think. dad. oh, yeah, yeah.|that's pretty stupid. dad. when did you first|learn to work on cars. i don't know. it's just|something i picked up along the way, i guess. well, is grampa good at|working on cars. oh, sure. i guess i learned|most of it from him. the fanbelt looks sorta loose. ya know, you're right. it's half rotten. i don't know|why i didn't think to check that. hey, look, there's a extra|fanbelt in the toolbox. why don't you help me|try to put it on. ok. as i worked on the car with|my father i began to realize what i'd been|looking for all along. i just needed|recognition. something to tell me that|i was growing up. hey, wayne. get out here|and start the car. ii can do it. nah, i don't think so, kev|you're not tall enough. here, start it nice and easy. yes i am.|step aside, little sprout. don't give it too much gas|till i tell ya. i don't want|to flood the engine. the story of my twelve and|three quarter year old life. as much a man as|the next guy, until the cards|were on the table. then it's a fine|"how do you do", a "pat him on the head",|and dammit, kevin. get the hell away|from that engine. that thing'll take your hand off. not anymore. happy birthday|dear kevin happy birthday to you. |and you smell like one too. well, my entrance into|the teen years. the big "onethree". could it get any sweeter|than this. darn. your dad wanted to|have the car back in time for the party so we could all|go for a ride after. yep. paul gets a band and|a thousand bucks and i get a ride in an impala|with a new fuel pump. well, why don't we just start.|he'll be along. here. open mine first. a poem. |here. i'll read it out loud. it's called|"the pain of youth". the pain of youth. all its slings and arrows stands breathless,|facing time. edging its way to the rim|of the nest. he is pushed, left to fall. fall. fall to the earth. and break, writhing in pain. that's my ride, i gotta go. happy birthday, kev. why don't you open the rest|of your presents. yeah, presents. who needed|a riteofpassage. who needed|a father's support. i had a turtleneck. a bathrobe. a wallet. and finally a thesaurus. well, i just thought when|you were writing a term paper or something,|and you wanted to say something is "good",|for example then you just turn to "good"|and you can say "considerate"|"unblemished", or "pure". any synonyms for "extremely|disapointed" in there. i'll be right back. hi. hi. thanks for coming. sorry i was so late. that's ok. |i felt like such a jerk up there. no. you were good. you had a big thing hangin'|from your nose but you were good. |butthead. paul. come on over here. come on. |what. and so it turned out to be|a great birthday after all. i slow danced with|paul's aunt selma. i ate more than mrs. pfeiffer|could have dreamed possible. and in a funny way,|when i look back on it i sorta feel like it was|my bar mitzvah, too. )
