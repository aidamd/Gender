movie info: 25. 0fps| in junior high school there were|days when you felt like nothing was worth|getting out of bed for. but then, you remembered you were going to see her. your day was gonna have|all these moments. moments that were full of|possibility. when you were sure|that something, something|was going to happen. and then, there were the moments|that made you really, really nervous. hell hath no fury|like a woman scorned. what do you think the poet|is trying to say. i don't know why, but|ever since i'd broken up with becky slater,|i felt uneasy whenever i saw her and winnie together. throughout literature,|we see images of women as avenging harpies driven by|mad fits of jealous rage. in greek mythology,|there's aphrodite, whose insane jealousy of|helen of troy triggered a war which led|thousands of men to gruesome, agonizing deaths. i started to think: a dumpee could really do|a lot of damage to a dumpster. a girl like becky slater could. but is this a fair|portrayal of women. or, does it say something about|men's fears and insecurities. i don't think women|are like that. i think most women,|when their feelings are hurt,|just get really sad. god, she was beautiful. |and she was right. i wasn't being|fair to poor becky. after all, i was the one|who had hurt her. and the sad thing was|i liked becky. i really did. we'd really had some|laughs together. so we were|at the dance, right. and paul,|you should see paul, he's doing the swim with|carla, you know. only he's so nervous|he's swimming like a sea monkey. he's like and then carla. you know,|she's like standing there, like staring at him, and|she's dancing like one of her feet has fallen asleep,|but she can't decide which one,|so she's like "well, is it this one or maybe|it's this one or this one" she's like dancing in jello. |she's like kirk mccray, he's the best. |all right, here. "hi. i'm kirk mccray. |if i'm gonna dance, i have to be very, very careful. |'cause if i move too fast, girls that we know|are gonna drop dead right down|on our dance floor. there goes another one. |sorry, pretty baby. " kevin. and then there's winnie. |there's always winnie, you know. she's like the ultimate miss priss. |she walks up to you like this. "hi, kevin. hi, paul. " you wanna look at her and say,|"what's the matter winnie, forget to take the hanger|out of your shirt." kevin. and then when|she dances, it's like, the bride of the mummy|does the pony. you know, she's all kevin, you're so mean. whooboy,|i guess it was sort of mean. some of those remarks|were the kind of things that might look bad|out of context. why do you think|the scorned lover seeking revenge is such a|recurrent theme in literature. i think revenge|is just a natural part of life. when someone does|something bad to you, you feel like doing something|even worse back to them. that's just normal. winnie was giving me|the cold shoulder. i had a bad feeling becky|had told her somethin'. winnie, did becky|say anything about me. like what. nothing. i don't know|did she. no. you sure.|yeah. well, then,|what's the matter. hold these. winnie. winnie. i think i'm sick. you're sick. it was great.|she was sick. becky hadn't told her anything. that's terrible. you should probably go. do you need anything.|do you want anything to eat. no. no, i'm not hungry. well, your mom's not here. who's going to|take care of you. don't bounce.|sorry. you got a fever all right. i'm gonna stay here until|your mom gets back. c'mon, let's get you under|the covers. but i don't want you to get sick. don't worry. |i never catch the flu. ok, what else do you need. you want me to turn|the radio on or something. yeah. kevin.|yeah. i have this this quilt that,|you know, my grandma made when i was little|you have a blankie. it's not a blankie. |it's a quilt. it's very warm and i always|use it when i'm sick, and oh, i understand. these things|are very important. so where is this blankie.|in the closet. it's on the top shelf. better. better. sitting there with winnie|i felt: electrified. something was about to|happen. something big. kevin. wow. what a look. she was makin'|my knees sweat. yeah. kev yeah. i think i think yeah. i'm gonna throw up. yes. this was goin' great. it was a magnificent|stroke of luck. winnie was sick for a week. i brought her|her homework assignments. i took care of her. i entertained her. we were closer than|we'd ever been. and i was happier than|i'd ever been. chapters five and six, and answer the study questions|at the end of each chapter. how's winnie doing. well, she's nauseous,|she aches all over, and she's running|a temperature of a 101. things were perfect. hi, kirk.|hi. hi, carla.|hi. becky. i had to patch things up|with becky. i wanted the whole world to be|as happy as i was. hi, becky. i just wanted to let you know|that i'm really sorry things worked out|the way they did. but, i'm really glad|we're friends now. i really am. and, i just want|you to know that i, i think you're great. |really great. thanks. you know, winnie wanted me|to say hi to you if i saw you. she's still sick, you know. |i know, the poor thing. i'm gonna stop by and|visit her on my way home from school today. |great. that's really great.|maybe i'll see you there. maybe. see ya.|see ya. what a girl. i'd completely misjudged her,|she wasn't holding a grudge against me,|she was my friend. i had so many friends. sea monkey. you think|i dance like a sea monkey. what's that supposed to mean,|i dance like a sea monkey. paul, i didn't call you|a sea mon well, ok, fine, i called you|a sea monkey, but i funny, kevin,|you're a real laugh riot. carla, you know how|sometimes you say silly things that you don't really mean. |like some people look like they're dancing in jello.. yeah, that would be one. |kirkbo what's your point, arnold..|you think i'm stuck up. no, i mean, i let's just get out of here,|you guys. we don't need to hang around|somebody like this. c'mon, you guys.|you guys. you know maybe i'd been|wrong again about becky slater. maybe she did hate me. maybe my love for winnie|had blinded oh, no, winnie. becky was on her way|over there. hell hath no fury|like a woman scorned. sorry, bobby. |i walk like a duck.. no. i mean, could we talk|about this later. boy, these people|were touchy. donna holton, did i, no, i never said|anything about her. i sing like a frog.. except that. of course not. you can't believe|everything you hear, donna. sorry, i gotta run. |hey. i never realized|i'd slammed so many people. my locker smells|like a stockyard. i'm gonna miss my bus, so boy, you get on a roll and i drive like an old woman, huh. winnie, i don't know what|becky told you, but whatever it is,|it is not true. are you saying becky's a liar. well, no, but|because becky's my friend. and i wouldn't want|anybody to say anything bad about her if it weren't true. well, no, it's just you know, some people think|that if you can't say something nice about someone,|you shouldn't say anything at all. winnie, listen you know, kevin,|i just never would have thought that you could be|that kind of person. ooh, not "that kind of person. " winnie, it was just a stupid joke. |i mean, i didn't even mean it. really, i didn't. i mean,|you know me better than that. it was just to be funny. haven't you ever said|something mean about someone just to be funny. i guess not. look, winnie, i'm sorry. i'm really, really sorry. |i'm really sorry. well, don't tell me your sorry. tell paul and carla and kirk. i just know if you'd said|something like that about me, i'd be really mad at you. what did you say. i said, "if you'd said|something like that about me, i'd be really mad. " this was weird. becky had told winnie|everything i'd said about everybody except her. but i wasn't gonna spend|my teen years waiting for the|other shoe to drop. i was gonna have it out with her. nothing was gonna|get in my way. nothing. certainly not my best friend|in the whole world whom i'd ridiculed|and treated shabbily, who was sulking|around my locker trying his hardest not to look like|he was giving me the chance|to make it up to him. paul. i don't wanna talk to you.|paul, look i know i hurt your feelings|and i'm really, really sorry. and i'm gonna make it up to|you really, really soon. i said i don't|want to talk to you. anyone that could be|so mean that hey, where are you going. i'm gonna be right back,|and then you can be as mean to me as you want. |hey, wait a minute. fine, go. all right. |c'mon, c'mon. slam me. just forget it. |no, c'mon, lay into me. no. paul, i was mean to you,|now you be mean to me. imitate me. |make fun of me. who wants to imitate you. all right, fine,|i'll imitate myself. here. well.|well it's hard. can't really think of|anything i do stupid. oh, yeah, right.|try the way you look, the way you talk,|the way you walk. you have those stupid|chipmunk cheeks. and your hair. you look like you're|wearing a cat on your head. see. that wasn't so hard. and let's face it, you're not exactly|mister coordination. you couldn't catch a football if|your life depended on it. great. |and that stupid jacket. you've never been to a jets|game in your life. i hate the way you sing.|all right, paul let me tell you,|your breath is not all right, paul. so are we still friends. well, why would i wanna be|friend with a guy who wears a cat|on his head. i gotta go. hey, wait. we haven't even|scratched the surface yet. we could spend the rest of|the day on your chin. hey, slater. as i approached my nemesis, a million thoughts raced|through my mind. who was becky slater.|what did she want. why did she have to have|such a good memory. i felt sort of like clint eastwood|confronting my mortal enemy. becky. kevin. well, that was about the extent|of my clint eastwood. let's face it,|if you're not gonna shoot somebody in a|situation like this, all you can really do is:|complain. why you spreadin' all those stories|about me all over school. i never said anything|that wasn't true. wellyou know|some people think that if you can't say something nice,|then you shouldn't say anything at all. oh, great, suddenly|you're mr. nice guy. well, excuse me|i didn't know. look, becky, i'm sorry. i'm sorry that we broke up,|i'm sorry about the whole thing. yeah. are you sorry you just|used me to get to winnie. are you sorry you just|pretended to like me the whole time when you|really just liked her. 'cause, you know,|i really think that's a terrible thing to do|to a person. look. i really liked you. |i really liked you a lot. well, whoopteedoo. well, what do you|want me to say. does it make you feel better|making my life miserable. yes, it does. so, what are you gonna do. go around and make|everyone hate me forever. no, if you got|some horrible disease, or got into a really|bad accident, i'd probably stop. well, good. |somethin' to look forward to. look, just tell me one thing: why didn't you tell winnie|what i said about her. or are you just waiting|for the perfect moment to completely ruin my life. what kind of person|do you think i am. a vengeful harpy driven by|mad fits of jealous rage. i mean, winnie's my friend. i would never tell her|anything like that. it would hurt her too much. so, you mean you're,|not gonna tell her. 'course not. at that moment, i found myself wishing|it was possible to like two girls at the same time. winnie would always be|the love of my life, but that becky|was really somethin'. sure, she had her flaws,|but you know what. the girl had heart. of course, i told paul and carla, and kirk and eric|and wendy and cindy, and kathy, well, kathy bedlow|and kathy cianfuentes, and tony and bob|and sheila, and nancy and tom and beth|and that whole group, and rodney the janitor, and mom, i feel terrible. i know you do, sweetheart. it's not the flu. i said some stuff about|some people at school. and then, they all found out|what i said, and now everyone hates me. well, honey,|it can't be that bad. it is. what'd you say. well, i said that bobby jensen|walks like a duck. oh, well, c'mon,|that's not so terrible. and that, paul dances|like a sea monkey. you said that. and, winnie walks around|like she forgot to take the hanger out of her shirt. that's not nice. everybody's gonna hate me. i could see the thoughts|forming in my mother's mind. things like: "well, you made your bed|and now you're gonna have to lie in it. " well, we all make mistakes. i think your friends'll|forgive you. you want me to bring you the tv. ok. thanks. i felt so much better,|i wanted to cry. how bad could i be.|my mother still loved me. but from now on,|i'd be a better person. if i didn't have|anything nice to say, i wouldn't say|anything at all. if only winnie would kevin. there's someone|here to see you. hi. hi. i hope you didn't|catch the flu from me. hey, i knew the risks. very cool. before you bend steel|with your bare hands you might wanna lose|mr. snuffles there. well, i'll leave you two alone. miss priss. bride of the mummy.|winnie it was just a joke. a joke.|i'll show you a joke. "hi, i'm kevin arnold. and i'm really nice to|people's faces, and then i cut them down|behind their backs." oh, are you sick.|here, i'll take care of you. what's the matter. stomach|feeling a little queasy is it. feels like the least little|thing might set it off. winnie, please. maybe i should get you|something to eat. have some, cole slaw,|liver, fried squid. winnie you poor thing,|you're not comfy. let me fix your pillows. you have fever,|you're burning up. that's ok, i'll help you. poor baby, now you're cold.|well here's your blankie. i guess that's when it hit me. winnie wasn't going to|forgive me for the things i'd said. it could only mean one thing: she wanted me bad. )
