screw the rules. my life was a shambles, and it wasn't just dad it was winnie. my only hope was i hadn't seen what i'd seen. kevin. even though i knew i had. oh. hey. yeah, i know. i figure i'd masquerade as one of the guests. think we couldyou know, maybe find some place to talk. about what. well, uh kevin i can't. i'm on duty. yeah, you've been on duty ever since i got here. i can't help it, it's my job. i bet. what was that.. listen, winnie, maybe this wasn't such a good idea. i mean coming up here. even though i know i encouraged it, butwhen you get down to it maybe you're right maybe it wasn't a good idea. what do you mean. maybe you should go. i felt like i'd been shot right through the tomato. wellthatthat's not what i meant. kevin, you said yourself that it was time that we find ourselves. right. you said we should give each other space. yeah, but winnie. what do you say, babe. and that's when i knew. for sure. winnie. what.. let go. i saw you. last night, at the party. i saw you. i came looking for you, and they told me you were there with eric. when i found you you were kissing him. the thing is, i didn't mean to accuse her. i just wanted her back. you saw me. so i i don't believe this you're spying on me.. what.. how dare you.. by that evening i'd come up with a plan win enough money to buy out the resort, and fire all the lifeguards. after that suicide. it's your bet, amigo. not that i was going down without one last moment of glory. i'm in for twenty. call. i'm in. yeah, here they came. see ya. the lambs to the slaughter. i'll raise ya fifty. fifty.. i don't have fifty. no pay, no play. what's it gonna be. my car. worth a couple hundred at least. well seventyfive, anyway. si, senor. read 'em and weep. it felt good. it felt like revenge, against the world that had turned against me. three kings. straight. full house. four jacks. oyoyoy. well, whatta you know the pot is mine, ha. the next morning i'd made up my mind. winnie. hey. i had all night to decide what to do. i just want ya to know and there ya had it. i'll be leaving now. i'd set out to find myself, and ended up losing everything. i examined my options. i had no car, no money, and no place to go. it was clear, what i needed here was a new philosophy. the philosophy of the loner. the philosophyof the road. hey. hey. so much for philosophy. what i needed was a ride. hey, stop. hey. hey. need a lift. yeah, actually. listen, is there a bus station around here. yes, hop in. thanks. oh, no. you two know each other. no. no. what happened. you ran out of bathing suits. can it. or did "mr. muscles" find himself a new squeeze. i got fired. they fired you. because of you. well, congratulations. who would have ever thought little miss twotimer would get a dose of her oh, you're really something. you know that. you are absolutely contemptable. that's it. stop the car i'm getting out. oh no. no, i'm gettin' out. fine, then get out. no. no. you get out. i'm stayin' here. so we both got out. thrown out. soyou happy now. i'm not speaking to you. i don't care. no skin off my nose. oh man, do you have to do that. do what. do you have to cry like that. i'm not crying. and i'm nota tramp. hey, if the shoe fits, right. oh, like you never looked at somebody else. what are you talking about. you're so transparent. oh, so this is some kind of a jealousy thing is that it. you're worse than transparent. you're a snake. oh, yeah. and that about said it all. goodbye, kevin arnold. yeahhave a nice life. i hate you. the feeling's mutual. so thanks to thirty billion kilowatts of unmetered electricity and about a ton of rain we ended up sharing the same barn. thank you. don't mention it. you know this is really, really great, you know that. it's almost funny. you think this is funny. yeah nah i mean, you grew up next door to someone andyou figure you really know 'em. and then, likeovernight, you find out you you didn't know 'em at all. yeah, well look who's talking. me. hey, i'm not the one who changed. you really believe that. you bet. i meanchanged a little, butnot really, though. but i guess i knew better. i guess we both knew better. kevin. it just took winnie to say it. here's what i think. i think this had to happen. todaytomorrow some day. i mean it's not like we're kids anymore. everybody grows up. it's not like peter pan or something no. it's not like peter pan. it's justsomehow i'd thought we'd be togetherya know. yeah. together forever. hmmm. it's not gonna happen, is it. no. winnie. i don't want it to end. once upon a time, there was a girl i knew, who lived across the street. brown hair, brown eyes. when she smiled, i smiled. when she cried, i cried. every single thing that ever happened to me that mattered, in some way, had to do with her. that day winnie and i promised each other that, no matter what, that we'd always be together. it was a promise full of passion and truthand wisdom. it was the kind of promise that can only come from the hearts of the very young. the next day winnie and i came home. back to where we'd started. it was the 4th of july in that little suburban town. somehow though, things were different. our past was here, but our future was somewhere else. and we both knew, sooner or later, we had to go. it was the last july i ever spent in that town. the next year, after graduation i was on my way. paul. hey, paul. hi. so was paul. he went to harvard of course. studied law. he's still allergic to everything. thanks a lot. listen, i'll be right back. hang on one second. as for my father well how you doin'. good. welcome home. we patched things up. norma. hey, we were family. for better or worse. hey, sis. one for all gosh. little kevin. and all for one. little eskimo. *yeah, i know. oh, my gosh. * karen's son was born that september. i gotta say, i think he looks like me poor kid. mom, she did well business woman, board chairman, grandmothercooker of mashed potatoes. the wayner stayed on in furniture. wood seemed to suit him. in fact, he took over the factory two years later when dad passed away. winnie left the next summer to study art history in paris. still we never forgot our promise. we wrote to each other once a week for the next eight years. i was there to meet her when she came home with my wife, and my first son eight months old. like i said, things never turn out exactly the way you planned. it was good. it was a good fourth. yeah. so you're gonna be a grandpa, huh. not bad. gray hair and everything. yeah, soon enough. growing up happens in a heartbeat. one day you're in diapers next day you're gone. but the memories of childhood stay with you for the long haul. i remember a placea towna house like a lot of other houses. a yard like a lot of other yardson a street like a lot of other streets. and the thing is after all these years, i still look backwith wonder. hey dad. wanna play catch. i'll be right there. )
