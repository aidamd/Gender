  :              and so, for you midyear graduates, while this ceremony marksthe end of your time as students, it is called "commencement". for now, the real work begins december, 1972, was a time of change for my family. a time of strange occurrences. improbable events. **pier almquist**. /and, a few surprises. norma arnold. after a twentyyear sabbatical in the kitchen my mother was graduating from state college. we were all pretty proud of her. as for my fatherafter a half a lifetime at norcom he decided to invest in the future. well, the future of furniture, anyway. the place looks wonderful, honey. what. /i said it looks wonderful. oh. you think it looks good nowwait'll the deal closes. we're gonna retool the whole place. make it completely stateoftheart. wait'll ya see it

other stuff. we were riding high on wings of lumber, and glue. those little stools that you sawoutside. well, this drillpress*makes the holes* /and noone was more excited than dad. he was just likea kid at christmas. speaking of which oh, look. bread's got a new album out. i hate bread. yeah, but the chicks love 'em. listen, are you gonna help me or not. i thought i was. uh, listen. if you were winniewhat would you want from me. ah, welli'd want you to hold me, and i'd want you to tell me that you love me and, i think that would be present enough. alrighta maserati. that's helpful. maserati's aside, i was faced with the annual yuletide challenge of a lifetime. finding a present for my best girl. look at these prices. who in their right mind would shop in a store like this. oh. hi, kevin. ask a stupid question / hi, jeff. winnie, what are you doing here. uh, just some shopping. so, what'd you get. just some stuff. right it was pretty obvious that in that box was something large, for a mediumsizedarnold. well, i better get going. yeah. we'regonna get going also. yeah, we got some stuff to buy. seeya. did you see the size of that box. yeah. so, what are you gonna do, man. there was only one thing to do. cashmere. it's the fabric of royalty. go for absolute broke. how big of a box does it come in. you really think she'll like it. there's not a woman alive who wouldn't. and, it's on sale. ninetynine ninetynine. ninetynine.. / ninetynine. that's almost a hundred dollars. very close, yeah. uh, i'm gonna think about it. she might be allergic. yeah, she's got a hive problem. i understand. great, now what am i gonna do. ow. i'm stuck in this tree. meanwhile, back at the ranch ow. come on, wayne swing your end around. i got pine needles in my arm. come on. quit foolin' around. get the tree in there. after all these years, dad had finally bought a tree worthy of our mansion. that's some tree, jack. what did you buy, the biggest one on the lot. come on let's get it up. ya ready. one, two, three. ok. maybe it was a little too worthy. you better get the saw. great. bonnie and i get the top part. suckers. don't you think you're going a little overboard, honey. what are ya talkin' about. besides, it's christmas. i felt like splurging. it was incredible. it was like santa claus making a housecall. uh, dad. / yeah, kev. and i was gonna be next on his list. could i, uhborrow a couple bucks. like say, ninetynine, ninetynine. it's justyou know, i want to get somethin' for winnie,and i'm running a little short, so sure. no problem. bingo. down the chimney he came. oh, honeycharlie called while you were out. he said he won't be able to make it over tonight. and then what's he getting coldfeet. my santa went south. what's that supposed to mean. it means nothing. he said everything was fine he had a few lastminute things he has to take care of and he'd see you at the bank on friday. dad. sure. buy her somethin' special. right. thanks, dad. well, like they say if at first you don't succeed ask mr. chong. mr. chong. / what.. i've been thinking. and, you know, i've been working here for about six months. and, i've donea pretty good job. wouldn't you say. allinall, a promising start. wellwhat i mean isi like it. huh. so what do you say. you don't have to give me a gift. no. no, i meant me. i'm not giving you a gift either. hmmm. seems what we had here was a failure to communicate. i don't think you understood what i meant. at least in english. i need a raise. there. the universal language. and what else could the guy say, but get back to work. december seventeenth. closing day for dad's new company. it was jack arnold versus the first national bank. needless to sayit was a pretty big moment for the old man. and we, in turn, were more than happy to share it with him. so, how long is this gonna take. where's charlie. he's fifteen minutes late. honeyjust be patient. he's probably stuck in traffic. you know, with everyone out holiday shopping uh, mr. arnold. we're ready for you now. uhwhat about barrett. shouldn't we wait. oh, that won't be necessary. we can start on the preliminaries. uh, well here goes nothing. good luck, honey. yeah, go get 'em, dad. yeah. knock 'em dead. with that, dad went to lay claim to his cornerof the american dream. aw, come on in, jack. uh, just help yourself, there /thanks. it was kind ofinspiring. hey if i open up three accounts i can get the coffeemaker, the toaster, and the canopener. after all, this was a savings and loan. and in a place like thisanything could happen. yes, mr. barrett. i see. no, i understand. well, it is, uha bit late, but uh i think we may have a problem. and i mean anything. apparently his finances are shakeyhe's withdrawn his application. one thing was clear whatever it was it wasn't good. /apparently not. thank you. we're sorry, jack, uh i don't believe it. jack. what happened. he's not coming he crapped out. why.. i'll tell ya why. he doesn't have the money. it was horrible. and then i knew it. things got worse. let's get the hell outta here. jack i saidlet's go. nice going, butthead. /what'd i say. now. and with thatthere went christmas. there went that cashmere sweater. / there goes my canopener. and we were left with nothing buta stocking full of coal. i'm tellin' ya, harv, it's a terrific opportunity. they've got a solid customer base, and a lot of potential. well, just let me knowthere's a lot of people interested in this. yeah. merry christmas to you, too. whoever it was who said holidays were a time for joy and celebration obviously wasn't hangin around my house that week. so, how's it going, honey. ohi don't know. i think i've acouple prospects. did ya talk to the bank. maybe they can help. i don't have enough collateral to carry the whole loan you know how conservative banks are. but don't worry. maybe there's a way we can make this work. still, even though dad was doing his best to keep our spirits up kev hand me one of those ornaments, huh. ya had the feeling things weren't exactly tinsel and glitter. i don't know maybe i oughtta make a few more calls. and the worst part wasthere was nothing we could do to help. not that my life was any bed of mistletoe. come on, you gotta be joking. i mean a hundred bucks.. for a sweater.. well, itit's cashmere. / the fabric of royalty. so. ninetynine bucks is too much to spend for any woman. what am i supposed to do. i think she's gonna buy me something really expensive. well, maybe you should go for it. last year, i spent eightyseven bucks on a gift. and sheloved it. who was that for. uhjust somebody i know. oh, come on, chuck. it was for your mother, wasn't it. maybe hi, kevin. woops. i was just wonderingare you coming over christmas eve. sure. / oh, good i can't wait till you see what i got you. it's really neat. well, listen, winniei hope you didn't go overboard, or anything. i mean, i would love anything you got me, and besides, it's just the thought that counts. don't be silly. it's christmas. i can't wait. man, are you in trouble. it boiled down to this my goose was cooked. mr. chong. i know we talked about this but i gotta have that raise. look, look, i wouldn't ask you if it wasn't really important. hey, i just thought /you got it. ii do. fifty cents more an hour. it was like discovering scrooge had a heart. wow. thank you. starting tomorrow. tomorrow. but, that's christmas eve. so. sono one works on christmas eve. congratulations. now you're one of santa's little helpers. hohoho. yeah. hohoho. driving home that night, it seemedthat the yuletide spiritwas everywhere. the suburbs were practically blazing with holiday cheer. it was almost as if every house on every street in americahad its christmas lights on. except one. there was only one light burning in our house. dad. how's it goin'. it's goin'. / jack. honeytomorrow's christmas eve. don't you think we should put up the lights. sure jack why don't you come to bed. in a minute, norma. i just want to run these figures again. that christmas eve day,i had a lot on my mind. i'd like to say i was thinking only of my dad, but i still hadn't found a gift for winnie. sorry. / that's ok. then, i ran intothe grinch. mr. barrett. / hey, kevin thanks so, uh you're doing a little shopping. yeah, well, the uhcompany gave us a small bonus for christmas. company. yeah, well i kinda went back to norcom. listenyou understand. i got a wife. three kids. the economy the way it is. you understand. right. right. sure. but i didn't. i just didn't. anyway, i gotta get goin'. say hi to your folks for me. merry christmas, kevin. and that's when i saw charlie barrett for who he was. not a grinch just a scared little manwho'd turn tail and run from a risk. as opposed to saymy dad. damn these things. a man who hated christmas lights. you ok, dad. you know i paid a fortune for these things. almost four bucks. yeah. back in 1946. you need any help. nahi got some more lights in this box. i'll give you a hand. oh, jeez. i can't do anything right. of course i could see he needed help. something to lighten the mood. take his mind off things. i ran into charlie at the mall. how is he. well he went back to norcom. /yeah, i heard. well, i was just thinking i bet you could go back. i mean, i bet norcom would love to have you back. i can't go back, kevin. / well, sure you can. listen. charlie barrett did not talk me into this. i did it because i wanted to. i did it because i had to. i did itbecause it was time. ya understand. sure, dad. besides, i got better things to do with my life. i gotta untangle these lights. and the funny thing is, standing there, that winter afternoon i knew things would be alright. maybe my father would never be his own boss. but in my eyes, he was something more. he was his own man. jack. hi. / hi. i see you got the lights out. yeahhow was shoppin'. fine. honey, i have to talk to you about something. i think i figured a way to make this work. norma, i've been over those figures six ways from sunday. and without a loan, there's no way to make it work i don't have enough collateral. actually, jack you do. what do ya mean. i just went down to the bank. you did what. i talked to that loan officer. i told him about your plans andprojections. but, mostly i told him about you. about the kind of man you are. i told them they should believe in you. the way that i do. they think that's collateral enough. you did that. they want to see you on monday. i don't know norma it's a helluva risk. i don't think so, jack. i guess some gifts are simple. they come from the heart with a lifetime guarantee. come on. let's get these lights up. and that afternoonchristmas finally arrived. that christmas eve, i delivered egg rolls and pork lomein for fifty cents more an hour. this is so beautiful. i can't believe this. it must've cost a fortune. then, i turned right around and squandered the profits on cashmere. i love it. still, i think it was worth it. i hope you like this. it's not like yours, but as for that big box, it turned out to be something much, much smaller. the new bread album. / do you like it. yeah, they're my favorite. i hated it. i loathed it. i despised it. merry christmas, kevin. merry christmas. then again, on the other hand i'd like to make a toast. that night we skipped the customary dinner at home. seemed there was a more fitting place to gather. to, uhnew beginnings. new possibilities. to my family. and to my girl. merry christmas. / merry christmas. we stayed up late. we talked about old times, new times. we ate turkey and dressingand egg rolls. after all, the way i saw it, that year, we had a lot to celebrate.   :  )
