"38 killed and 123 wounded|as american troops" "and north vietnamese refugees|clash near the border. " "in some of the most" "brutal fighting"|do you believe that $1. 19 for a pound of bacon.|just last week it was 99 cents. there's hardly any lean|meat on there. norma, where are my brown socks.|they're in the dryer. wayne. why don't you have a|little toast with your jelly. that is so gross. |kevin eat your eggs. mom, the yokes are runny. |i can't eat them if the yokes are runny. in nineteensixtynine,|we had the vietnam war for breakfast, lunch and dinner. i guess it was inevitable that|we stopped paying attention. "a seemingly endless|procession of refugees" "has flooded saigon|in the last 24 hours. " "and the food, shelter|and medical services" "are already in short supply" you had to stop|paying attention. "get involved in government. " "remember, it's your|student council, people. " alright, class. |you heard mr. diperna. let's have nominations for our|home room representative. home room elections. as a scholastic highlight, it ranked right up there|with "safety week". alright, then, who wants to be|our representative. any volunteers. surely there is someone|in this room with enough respect|for democracy to volunteer to be our representative|to the studentcouncil. kevin.|can i go to the bathroom. is your home room|having elections. yeah. it's pretty lame though,|nobody's even running. yeah. it's kinda cool to be|president or something but home room rep|is for weenies. yeah. alright|we have one vote for mr. ed very funny and we have four votes|for ringo starr. and we have 26 votes, for our new home room|representative who's the weenie.|kevin arnold. well, some men pursue|greatness and some men have greatness|thrust upon them, while they're in the bathroom. paul. kevin, what are you|doing here. they made me|home room representative. can ya believe it.|yeah, me too. how'd you get stuck with it.|i dunno. it was either the balloons|or the pencils. about an hour into the meeting,|i began to see the true nature|of studentcouncil. it was basically|organized whining. how come we only have|icecream sandwiches in our icecream machine. i mean at madison,|they have three choices. i think we should|have pushups. drumsticks.|popsickles. alright. |alright. the proposal is to offer|pushups in the ice cream machine. but when it came to the issues|that really mattered party lines were crosses, and|everyone rallied their support. i think we should|have a jukebox in the cafeteria. order, order, order that's better. |now, do i have a second. well, obviously,|you're all in favor. well, if there are no more|proposals, we can yes, mark.|what is it. yeah i propose we|honor the national moratorium next friday|by organizing a walk out to protest the immoral|imperialistic, colonialist repression of the peoples|republic of vietnam, by the running dog lackeys|of the fascist us government. any seconds. sorry, mark|it's a chance to make a real statement against|the war. there'll be marches all|over the country. we'll be walking out|during class. alright, hold on. |listen, hey. now, i don't know|if the student council can vote to do|something like this. mr. tyler. mr. tyler. he was faculty|advisor to the student council, but more than that|he was our cool teacher. you know the type. |rides a motorcycle lets you have class|outside on nice days lacks respect for authority everybody waited to see,|what mr. tyler would say. like mr. diperna says|this is your student council. all in favor. don't forget to sign up|for a committee. meeting is adjourned. we have to join a committee.|yeah, come on. there's school spirit, social,|icecream, jukebox, or walk out. so what do you say,|jukebox. no, the line's|too long for jukebox. well, i'd say social, but|nancy cardian's the chairman for that, and|mrs. gambino's the advisor. and i can't stand|either one of those, so i don't know,|maybe icecream well, which one is mr. |tyler advisor for. i don't know. |looks like he's doing walk out. let's do walk out. ok, pick a card,any card. alright, now look at it|don't tell me what it is. put it back. hi. what's your name.|kevin. kevin, cut the cards. good. is that your card. no. no. well, wait a minute. is that it. no. well is that it. how'd you do that. we did card tricks for about|twenty minutes and then switched to 5card stud. i couldn't believe it i'd never|known a teacher like this. mr. tyler was so cool you could feel yourself|becoming cooler in his presence. alright, paul, your deal. |mr. tyler. when are we gonna talk about|the walk out. leave it to mark hooper|to spoil a good thing. well, it's about time. hey, it's not my meeting. ok, well i think we should talk about|the walk out. i think we need a strategy. ok|ok, so what do we do first. well, maybe you should start by, figuring out how you're gonna|mobilize 800 students all at the same time. |right, right. how do we do that. well, that's why we have|all these minds here. what do you think, rusty. good luck. it's not that rusty|drotman was stupid it's just that he sort of drifted|through life in a purple haze. wow. well, we could just well, we could just|like, you know, i mean,you know, wow. think, rusty, think. think.|ok, wait. ok. so ok, i got it.|we all split up, and ok, you can do it. |come on. and knock on all the homeroom|doors to give 'em the signal. ok, ok, good.|so, so at nine o'clock we go to all the homerooms,|we mobilize the whole school, and then we march out|on the football field. then what.|"then what." well, i mean, what is|the point of this walk out. how is standing around in a|football field going to end the war.|who's gonna know the difference. kevin.|ii don't know, unless unless we can get on tv,|or something. or, or in the papers. yeah, wait, wait.|that's good, that's good. we could use|we could use the media. we could we could write a letter to|channel 5 and tell them we could get other schools|to do it too like madison and whitman yeah. and we could organize|this whole big thing where all the kids|from all the schools mr tyler, could i speak|to you for a moment. about this walk out it's gotta be stopped ok, there is something mr. diperna|here would like to say to you. thank you. mr. tyler. i'm afraid that kennedy junior|high school cannot tolerate a studentcouncil committee|that encourages students to violate school rules. any student participating in|a walk out during school hours will be subject to|immediate suspension, and, it will go on your|permanent record. do i make myself clear. your permanent record. after the initial shock of|mr. diperna's announcement, we did what any teenager|would do when his deepest convictions are challenged. it's not fair. we whined. are we going to do it.|well, what do you think. i don't know. i don't want to get suspended|from school sounds pretty smart to me. |i think we should fight 'em. why. because we should protest the war. are you guys really|serious about that. of course we are. why do you want to|protest the war. because it's|an imperialist act by mr. tyler. i'm sorry, mark. it's funny,|the moment i hear the word "imperialist", i go into a coma. can't you just tell me|in your own words. what about you, kevin. why do you|want to protest the war. i don't know|so, you're just going along with the crowd. |no. seems to me|if you don't know why you're doin' somethin',|it can't be worth much. mr. tyler was right. i felt like an idiot. what did i really know|about the vietnam war. i wasn't even sure if|"vietnam" was one word or two. is it that you think|all wars are wrong. well yeah. so, you think, nothing's|worth fighting for. well, no i mean|well, then, how can you sure we should end this war. well, it's like, a lot of|people are getting killed. you know, like, little kids, and|their whole families and stuff. and people from over here|who are fighting, don't always even want to fight. they don't have any choice|or they have to go to jail, and and, yeah, the thing is,|you know, nobody even knows what there really|over there for. as we all talked,|we began to realize that maybe we knew more than|we thought we did. sure, we didn't really|know ho chi min from captain kangaroo,|but we knew that a lot of people|were getting hurt. and we knew that it didn't|seem to be doing anybody any good. ii just think it's wrong,|that's all. ok. so. what do you want to do. we need a strategy. |what's our strategy. well, a few people|are aware of this, but i have know for a fact|that paul pfeiffer here is a great political strategist. i am.|come on paul, you are among friends|you don't need to keep up the cover. |lets show that mind works ok. i think i got it. how about if we start a petitiondrive. a petitiondrive. well, yeah. you know,|if we could collect enough signatures,|then we could force diperna to take us seriously. it's over fourhundred signatures. yes, indeed. i appreciate you|showing these to me. now, there's something|i'd like to show to you. section, 1, 7, 3, 9 point 5|of the state education code. kevin. read that for us. all students|shall remain in class at all times|during school hours, unless otherwise authorized|by the administration. and that, ladies and gentlemen|is the law of the land. we can either obey that law,|or we can suffer the consequences. now, if you would like to|write your state assemblymen, and try and get the law changed,|more power to you. but, as long as|it's on the books if i, or any other teacher,|were to allow this we'd be promoting truancy. |and an educator can't advocate that. now can he. now, i know you're|disappointed, but think of this as a learning experience. did you learn something. yeah. i learned you're|an even bigger butthead than i thought you were. i guess so. well, that's what|school's all about, isn't it. don't forget, for anyone|who thinks that he's above the law,|that's immediate suspension and it will go on your|permanent record. your permanent record. and mr. tyler|i'd like to speak with you. well it was a bit of a setback. but we were getting used to|locking horns with authority figures. we reacted pretty maturely. it's not fair.|diperna's a jerk. we whined. he can't get away with this. |what about our rights. what about the petition.|over fourhundred signatures. what's the use of having|a student government, if you can't take any action.|i mean, what is he. king. and it's a free country. he can't|stop us, can he, mr. tyler. boy, he was really goin'|after the old chin. i was afraid he was|gonna rub it right off. no, he can't stop ya. you can do whatever|you want to do. but you should give your actions|serious consideration, because they may have|serious consequences. are you telling us not to do it. was he. had diperna gotten to him. no. i'm not sayin' that. in a way, you're lucky|to have opposition. that's the way life is. it's easy to take|a stand on something if there's no risk involved. it's easy to give a quarter|too a poor man if you keep a dolar|for yourself. it's easy to take a stand|against the war so long as nobody asks you|to make a real sacrifice. but not all of us are ready|to sacrifice. too high. what do you think|we should do. i can't tell you that. each of you has to make that|decision for himself. "immediate suspension|from school, and it will go on your|permanent record do i make myself clear.|your permanent record recordrecord" "and now, at last. |the heroic crew of first manned|space flight to mars, led by commander|kevin arnold. wait a minute, wait a minute. this just in. we have just learned|that kevin arnold left class during school hours,|when he was in seventh grade. i can't believe it, jim. |the mission has been scrubbed. " i don't remember when|i finally made the decision. i guess i didn't know|what i was gonna do until i found myself doing it. we were gonna walk|right up to mr. tyler, and show him|what we we're made of. i couldn't wait to see|the look on his face when he saw what|we'd decided. he was gonna look so proud. |so happy. so much like a woman. where's mr. tyler.|he's out with the flu. what.|sounded like he had a bad case of this flu. what. i didn't know what to think. |was mr. tyler a coward. i mean, to believe|in somebody like that, and to have it all turn out|to be a lie. i was a feeling in the pit of my|stomach that was completely new. i had to make a decision. everybody was watching me. buzzing about the walk out. what was i gonna do. was i gonna lead the walk out. or was i gonna chicken out, too. and then i decided. i'd just get up, walk out that door, into the hallway and into the bathroom. i was gonna throw up. there wasn't gonna be|any walk out. what's happening.|it's the walk out. don't you know|about the walk out. and that's how i started,|the great kennedy junior high peace walk out|of 1969. as i said, some men|pursue greatness and some men have|greatness thrust upon them while they're in the bathroom. "all we are saying" "is give peace a chance. " "all we are saying" "is give peace a chance. " "all we are saying" i'm not sure we really changed|anything that day. i suppose the war would|have gone pretty much the same if we'd|stayed in home room. but one thing would be different. we wouldn't have|the memory to carry with us today, of eighthundred children|on a football field, singing. and, it wouldn't all be on|our permanent record. "all we are saying" "is give peace a chance. " subtitle by taurus mind )
