ahhh. after 10,000 years, i'm free. its time to conquer earth. alpha, rita's escaped. recruit a team of teenagers with attitude. # go, go, power rangers # # go, go, power rangers # # go, go, power rangers # # mighty morphin power rangers # # power rangers # # power rangers # # go, go, power rangers # # you mighty morphin power rangers # welcome to parent's day. ow. ohh. you giving up, dad. physical and mental strength should go hand in hand. it's always been a winning combination. i'll say. what do you think's keeping billy. you know how my son is when he's occupied with a new invention. skull: yeah, boring. ha. and here we have the zackman and his parents. hiya, folks. okay, skull, show's over. anyway, as i was saying so, here we are at parent's day. the eats look pretty good. and here's my parents making nice with caplan. skull, will you kindly put that camera down. now, i assume that bulk and his parents will be joining us. he did tell them about parent's day, didn't he. oh. yeah, sure, mr. caplan. his folks were having some trouble with their car. they should be cruising on in just about now.    huh. bulk: we're here. this is my good dress. oh, hon, you've never been sweeter. hi, trini. hi, trini. hi. is kimberly here. no. i though she was coming with you. kimberly's dad just walked in. i wonder where she is. if you're looking for kimberly, i just saw her outside. thanks. um, i'll go get her for you. rita: parent's day. mama. mama. yes, my queen, the humans seem to feel that their parents are very important people. they go on and on. we need a monster who will get the rangers' parents. we'll have control. that's good. i suggest we use the dramole monster. he comes with a perfectly delightful gas hypnotizing anyone who breathes i and burrows beneath the ground undetected. the dramole can hypnotize their parents and kidnap them. once we have their parents the ransom will be their surrender to me and i'll accept their surrender. then i will destroy the world.  there you are. kimberly, what's wrong. everything is so messed up. my mom and dad have hardly seen each other since they got divorced. sometimes i just think this is all my fault. kimberly, you know that's not true. trini, i don't think my dad's going to show up. your mom and dad are back at the party looking for you. really. mmhmm. that is so great. we don't need this right now. who invited them anyway. partycrashersthey totally annoy me. i think we're in trouble here. ayyiyiyiyi. kimberly and trini need some help. you must hurry, alpha. alert the other rangers. right away, zordon. ayyiyi. what a girl.  we read you, zordon. right outside the youth center putties have attacked kimberly and trini. well, billy's not with us but zack and i are on our way. alpha will contact billy. hurry. the putties are beginning to get on my nerves. you can say that again. man, these creepazoids don't quit. it's time to teach them some manners. goldar: with their parents trapped in the dark dimension the rangers will be forced to surrender their power coins to me. hey, dad. what's the matter. you didn't eat enough. your stomach's growling like a diesel engine.  hey, what's going on.. kimberly. where's kimberly. what's that smell. mommy. aw, man, i'm late. huh. that's strange. ah. one ranger is there all alone. this is great. goldar, look, we can pu the blue ranger under our spell. we will use him to retrieve the dragon dagger. hmm this has got to be a hoax. hey, what kind of hoax is this.  what is rita up to this time. one wordtrouble. i want to get back and see my parents. this is all getting too strange for me. rita: blue ranger, i am your evil queen. and i am the power you will answer to. bring us the dragon dagger. bring us the dragon dagger. yes, o mistress. i obey your command. jason: i hope my parents didn't see any of that.  rita: bring us the dragon dagger. you are in my command. alpha, i detec something amiss here. billy, no. oh, yes you poor excuse for a transistor radio. but billy, i'm your friend. billy, listen, you're under rita's influence. why should i listen to you.. you're nothing bu an inflated windbag of a head. i have a mission to complete for my mistress. billy i order you to stop. order all you want. it's not going to help you once i return this to its true rightful owner. what's going on. how can a roomful of people just disappear into thin air. i can think of a few possibilities and i don't like any of them. this is my mom's scarf. i gave it to her for her birthday. what's happened to our parents. let's try and stay calm. i'll contact zordon. zordon, something terrible's happened. can you tell us what's going on. i'm aware of the situation. teleport to the command center. guys. where are our parents. what is rita up to now. what can we do. rangers, you must calm down. your parents are safe for now. what do you mean. for how long. for the time being. that's all i can say. billy. zordon, where's billy. billy has fallen prey to the dramole monster rita used to kidnap your parents. while under the influence of the monster's noxious gas he deactivated alpha and stole the dragon dagger. oh, my gosh. i think i can reactivate alpha. oh, trini, thank goodness. um, is billy all right. billy is engulfed in the gas of the dramole monster which allows rita to control his mind. what is a dramole monster. observe the viewing globe. if he hurts our parents or billy. what is rita up to, zordon. destruction using the dragonzord. you must reclaim the dragon dagger. and if we don' then there'll be no more angel grove. where's billy now. billy has taken the dragon dagger to rita's dark dimension. you must try and stop him before it's too late. i'll keep trying to locate your parents. it's morphin time. mastodon. pterodactyl. sabertoothed tiger. tyrannosaurus. billy, no. don't do it. good. good, yes. bring me the dragon dagger. it's no use. he's under my control. fight it, billy. fight the spell. fools. putty patrol attack.  # we will come # # it's in your sight # # we'll protect you from your pride # # all of us are on your side # # we'll take them out # # we'll take them # # out # # fight # no. he's got it. oh, man. what's happening. you gave me the dragon dagger. oh, no. what have i done. it's not your fault. you were under a spell. you've all fallen into my trap. now that i have control over the dragonzord you have no choice but to surrender your power coins for your parents. why should we do what you say. because you really have no other alternative. behold. this will remind you of the time you have slipping away. once the sand is through the glass, you must decide. your power coins or your parents. no.  what do we do. figure out a way to keep our coins and save our parents. hey, guys, what about billy. the spell's worn off, and we really need him. billy, come on. let's go. it's morphin time. right. triceratops. power rangers.     all right. tyrannosaurus

power.  let's go.  your time is up, power rangers. turn over the power coins or lose your parents forever. try zordon. zordon, what do we do. i cannot tell you what to do. this decision affects your parents. you alone must make the choice.  tell me, rangers. are you ready to make the ultimate sacrifice. we've got to do this. agreed. let's get it over with. all right. our power coins for our parents. goodbye, red ranger. if you harm my parents in any way silence. give me the coin. no more pink ranger to get in my way. goldar, you're going to pay for this.  fool. bring the next coin. it's been great being rangers. but our parents are more important. we're doing the right thing. yes. one more and the power rangers will be history.  i'm sorry, guys. if it wasn't for me well so now that you have what you want, goldarour power coinsgive us back our parents. fools. did you really think i'd return them back to you. what for. i intend to destroy the world. and now nothing can stop me. please, no. you won't get away with this.  rita: we won. you're using your head this time. i knew we wouldn't fail. this is fantastic. ayyiyiyiyi. alpha, teleport the power rangers to the command center immediately. they all look so strange. and zordon was able to locate them. we can see they're unharmed. i can't believe we trusted goldar. he tricked us. what else could we have done. you made the correct choice, ranger. ayyiyiyi. it was such a hard decision. all right. so what do we do now. goldar has all the power coins. not all of them. we still have one. where is everybody. # go, green
