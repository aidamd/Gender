ahhh. after 10,000 years, i'm free. its time to conquer earth. alpha, rita's escaped. recruit a team of teenagers with attitude. # go, go, power rangers # # go, go, power rangers # # go, go, power rangers # # mighty morphin power rangers # # power rangers # # power rangers # # go, go, power rangers # # you mighty morphin power rangers # tommy: i don't believe this. rita has linked my powers to a candle. if the flame burns out while in her possession, your powers will belong to rita. zordon, isn't there anything we can do. journey into rita's dark dimension and get the candle. so how do i get there. you don't. you would accelerate rita's spell. another ranger must go in. i'll go. forget it. no way. look, it makes sense. i'm the only other ranger who's ever been there. it's too dangerous. it's your only chance. no, i won't risk something happening to jason because of me. you're one of us, a power ranger. i won't stand by and watch while we lose a teammate. jason speaks for all of us. yeah. thanks, man. alpha: zordon. i found it. found what. the molecular energy patterns left by the putties in the park. what is he talking about. alpha's found the doorway to rita's dark dimension. the green candle burns bright, oh queen but soon it will be out. then green ranger's power will be yours, all yours. and with that power i shall take over the world. uh, yeah. you know the plan, goldar. let's do it. ah, they're ready. ayyiyi. i sure hope this works, billy. what are these. molecular decoders. alpha found traces of the putties' molecular pattern. oh, from when they took tommy. since the putties teleported to rita's dark dimension we can follow the same path. molecular decoders. exactly. got it. everyone ready to teleport. yep, we're all set. zack: we're out of here. thanks. i don't know what else to say. absolutely nothing. know that you mean a lot to us. jason: let's do it. alpha: stay in contact, rangers and be careful. good luck, my friends. rita: i can't wait till i'm queen of everything. cyclops.. do we understand each other. you know what i mean, goldar. cyclops will go to earth to impersonate dragonzord forcing the power rangers into battle. boy, will they be confused. meanwhile, the green candle will burn. excellent. did you get that. yes. go, cyclops. is this the place where goldar captured tommy. yeah, i'm pretty sure. good. let's get ready to set up the decoders.  hey. the geeks are on top of our hill. come on. let's see what they're up to. is this right. almost. they need to line up exactly. give me a hand. how soon, billy. that should just about do it. let's fire these puppies up. hey.  you guys hear that really gross sound. yeah. yeah.  hey. you guys are in our private park. yeah, our private park. actually, fellas, it's a public park. anyone can visit. yeah, anybody but you, brainiac. so get going. now.. leave us alone. we've got work to do. hey, bulk, what are those things. i don't know. let's find out. hey, you can look but don't touch. nobody tells me what to do. bulkie, boy. are you okay.  you don't look so good. i don't feel so good. the ports will open up here almost immediately once the decoders are activated. man. i just feel bad i'm not with them. tommy, you must trust in your friends. i do, zordon. if jason can get into the other dimension i just know he'll get that candle. ayyiyi. red alert. what's happened. there's an attack on a city near angel grove. engage the viewing globe. alpha: it's dragonzord in battle mode. but how. all of our zords are on standby. it can only be an imposter. no doubt it's rita's cyclops monster posing as dragonzord, assuming its power. shall i contact the rangers. that is what rita hopes we will do so that while the power rangers are occupied the green candle will burn down. let me take them on. but you will be alone. give me this chance. very well, and let the power protect you. all right. it's morphin time. dragonzord. time for the real dragonzord power. squatt: it's not going very well, is it. ooh oh, yeah. i'm coming aboard. all right. now let's go get them. poor power ranger, your doom is near. aah. the candle nears its end. soon green ranger's powers will be yours. the first decoder's been activated. the second decoder activated. try the remote, then. zordon, i'm going in. good luck, jason. and may the power protect you. i'm ready. close the portal after i'm in. hey, jason good luck. thanks, bro. i'll need it. well, it seems i have a guest. welcome back, old friend. hyah. what an unexpected pleasure. ooh, pressure. you think you're going to save your friend don't you. you don't have a chance.  come and get it little red ranger. he's been in there too long. come on, jase. green ranger's in trouble, zordon. i must send the other rangers to help him. what about the green candle. ayyiyiyiyi. i'm worried about jase. he should have been back by now. i'm sure everything's fine. these things just take time.  zordon, what is it. abort the mission. green ranger is in trouble. what about jason. he's not back yet. one of you enter the portal and retrieve him. i'll go. be careful, zack. get jason and yourself back safely. i'm ready. zack: jason. you missed your chance. what are you doing here. come back. tommy's in trouble. you're all in trouble. but he'll lose his powers. he could lose his life. which will you choose. come on, jason. come on. you gave up too easily. jason. zack. you guys okay. the candle. i didn't get it. we'll have to go back. it's morphin time. mastodon. pterodactyl. triceratops. sabertoothed tiger. tyrannosaurus. # go, go, power rangers. # go. yeah. morph on. morphin. morphin. rita: burn, candle, burn. you can't take my powers, rita. i'm the green ranger. ultrazord. ultrazord. # go, go, power rangers. # # go, go, power rangers. # # go, go, power rangers. # # mighty morphin power rangers. # ultrazord sequence complete. lock on and fire. let's get to the command center. yeah. yeah.  the green candle is almost out. soon my queen shall be allpowerful. behold the flame's last gasp. we're going back in after the candle. it's too late, rangers. the green candle has been extinguished. rita's won. there is only one way to stop the transference of power. green ranger must give up his power coin. no way. there's no choice. by giving his coin to another ranger tommy can prevent rita from gaining its power. i guess this is it. it's been great. oh, tommy don't worry. i'll be all right. huh. oh ahh. tommy. tommy, i'm so sorry. no. they've stolen my power. it was mine. another of my perfect plans ruined. i'll get them back for thiszordon, his power rangers, that talking tin can too. it's over, isn't it. yes, i'm afraid so. and rita. with the coin in jason's hands the power is protected. i feel strange inside. your body is morphing back to its normal state. oh, this is weird. you are a strong and courageous fighter and an honorable man. something's happening. are you okay. it was great being a ranger, zordon. you'll always be with me. i'm sorry, tommy. we tried to get the candle. you did what you had to do. my powers are with you now. use them to defeat rita. you can count on it, man. what's important to me now is my friendship with all of you. i don't ever want that to change. it won't, tommy. you'll always be one of us. they said back at the gym i'd find you here. yeah. i like practicing outside sometimes. you know, smell the fresh air. how are you doing. i'm hanging. i've been working on my karate focusing on my school work. i'm just trying to keep busy. we miss you. yeah. you guys were a team long before i showed up. it will all be back to normal before long. i miss you. i've been wanting to do that for a long time. me too. now that that's over with. i guess my next question is a piece of cake. what's that. kimberly, will you be my date for the dance saturday night. well. kimberly. i didn't want to make it too easy for you. of course i'll be your date to the dance. yes. yes. captioned by grant brown )
