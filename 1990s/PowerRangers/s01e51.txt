"b" stands for "bad"didn't you know that. yeah, "b" stands for "bulk" also doesn't it. back off, bulk. yeah, leave him alone. see ya. wouldn't want to be ya. rita: poor billy got a "b". that gives me an idea. finster, make me a monster. a horrible stinging bee. ah, yes, your evilness. with my superputty i can create just what you're looking fora powerful grumble bee monster with a nasty venom and sharp stingers.  kitchykitchykoo. this monster will mean the end of the power rangers. hey, man, don' take this so hard. kimberly: remember you tried and you did your best. you look like you could use a break. come shoot a few baskets with us. uh, no thanks i appreciate your efforts but acceptance into the young scientists of america club is very important to mei'd better study. okay, i'll stay behind. i can help quiz you. thank you, that would be most helpful. jason: later, billy. bye. see ya, dude. this says that the bee is the highest form of insec belonging to the order hymenoptera. i can't believe i blew the test on a bee question. do you know what it means. it's a term which defines the specific order of insects, such as bees. you're amazing, billy. let's get him, jase. no problem, i'm taking it got you again. i wonder how tommy is doing at the karate tournament. this is an importan match for him, huh. oh, he's going to blow the competition away. he was really prepared. you know, speaking of being prepared i hope billy doesn't ge too tired from studying. oh, me, too i mean, getting a "b" on a tes is nothing to be ashamed of. brats, i've got a new tes for you. i told you ninnies to call goldar. goldar, you know wha to do next, don't you. i and my putties shall engage the rangers until grumble bee is ready. right, get to it. now you two go do something nasty. oh, yes, ma'am. oh, no, putties. spread out. let's take 'em. you think you're pretty smart, power rangers but trust me, your lessons have just begun. cut it out, putty brains. this magic rope will keep you behind a powerful force field and out of our way. enjoy the class so far. you won't get away with this, goldar. i already have. you failed this test, power rangers.  you've met your match this time, power brats. rita's grumble bee will destroy you and the world. ayyiyiyiyi. what are we going to do, zordon. contact the rangers immediately, alpha.  aw, man. we can't even telepor out of this force field. what are we going to do. i don't understand itjason's not responding, zordon. alpha, the rangers are in trouble in angel grove park. ayyiyiyiyi, the rangers are really in a bind. now what do we do, zordon. we must locate billy and trini at once. i'll get right on it, zordon.  yes, zordon. teleport to the command center. let's go. what's happening, zordon. where is everyone. goldar's rope is holding them in an electronic force field. observe the viewing globe. i can't figure out how to free them. ayyiyi, this is an awful mess. we have to go to them. zoldar: waitthere's an even more serious problem. return your attention to the globe. rita's monstrous grumble beeit spouts lethal venom and shoots poisonous stingers. left unchecked, i could destroy mankind. we got to stop it. but we can't just leave the others. zordon: alpha will continue working on that problem, rangers. it is up to you to head off rita's monster. it's morphin time. triceratops. sabertoothed tiger. there he is. buzz off, bee. that's not very neighborly of you. we don't want you for a neighbor right, billy. right, trini. let's get him.  billy. are you all right. ha, ha. come on, billy, high kick. hurry, billy. right. here i come. billy, what happened. the bee's venom is making me weak. stay herei'll take him. you could keep trying, little rangers but now you'll see why it's hopeless.  it's emitting some kind of ultrasonic tones.  now you feel the effects of my secret power. there's no way we can fight it. we've got to get out of here. let's go. the ultrasonic waves are too powerful. we have to find the monster's weakness. alpha is creating a special weapon for that purpose. behold the viewing globe.  what about the others. we have to try and free them. good luck, rangers and may the power protect you. there they are. glad to see you guys. kimberly: hurry, guys. hurry, please. guys, do something.  zordon, we can't get them free. the situation has gotten worse. you must battle the grumble bee again. but how can we leave them. you have to go. you and billy have to stop the monster. now. affirmative, jason. we'll do our best. it's morphin time. triceratops. sabertoothed tiger. we're back to teach you a lesson. you'd better beeware. you felt my sting, now taste my poison venom.  oh, no, billy. what is this stuff. are you all right. i'm all right so far but the venom is highly toxic. it's eating through my suit. alpha: i managed to loosen the force field, zordon but they're still tied up. try focusing your energy beam on one small part of the rope. there, that did it. we're free.  we read you, zordon. hopefully alpha has freed you in time. you must morph to help trini and billy. let's give rita a lesson. it's morphin time. mastodon. pterodactyl. tyrannosaurus. we're all here now. oh, you're all here, bu so are my swarm of putties.  come on, let's get 'em. hey, vacuum heads. thanks for the lift, but no thanks. you're a pain in my wings. you're through, bee. listen up, class. oh, man, i can't take much more of this. none of you will pass this test. hang on, the effect will wear off like the venom did. you'll pay for this. oh, i'm shaking. oh, i think i had the hemulator on backwards. hasta la pizza, baby. yippee, it works. this ought to do the trick, zordon. good, alpha alert the power rangers that help is on the way. i'm sending you some backup, billy. this ought to even up the score. thanks, alphai know just what to do.  okay, grumble bee, here's lesson number one. oh, no, you don't. stop it, stop it. yeah, billy, way to go. he's coming unglued. let's put him down. dust storm, make the monster giant.   all right, rangers, we need dinozord power, now. all right. rangers, log on. zack here, it's time to jam. billy here, systems

little closer. what, do you want to slow dance. that's not how i get my kicks. here's a real blast for you guys. jason, we got to back down.  we can't back off just because we're in a little trouble. you're right. your puny sword can't save you. i bet that thing isn't even real. want to bet.  # go, go, power rangers. # # go, go, power rangers. # # go, go, power rangers. # all right, let's do it.
