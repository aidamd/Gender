"the crash and burn. " naw, he just tripped himself up. just like i'm going to do at the dance contest. zack seems to be experience a transient deficiency in selfesteem. zack doesn't have enough confidence in himself. hey, zack's cool he'll get over it. zack's feeling a little down, eh. perfect. lokar will have no trouble sending the power geeks to my island. ooh. lokar. i remember the last time she called on him he nearly wiped us out. whoa. not lokar. let go of me, you bubblehead. we're going to do this my way. of course, your evilness. your plan is brilliant. i summon the power of evil lokar the terrible and mutitis. come now and destroy all the earth.  what is going on.. there's a destablization of the tropospheric pressure zone. it's got to be rita. i hate when this happens. come on, guys. we got to contact zordon. power rangers to zordon. yes, jason, i'm picking up unusual power surges from rita's moon base. this energy is more massive than i have ever sensed. rita maybe harnessing a power i'm not familiar with. ay yi yi yi yi. gotcha. we got to find zack and let him know what's going on. trini: come on. boy: help. help. tommy, what's going on.. i can't leave my students. go ahead. i'll catch up. right, man. i understand. let's go. don't worry, guys. it will be all right. wicked winds and evil dance, heed my chants. blow. i shall challenge the rangers with a hail of putty patrollers, my queen. there he is. bad news, bud. trini: zordon says she's about to start something. she already has. look. excellent. scorpina and goldar will wear them out for mutitis. al right, get them. you guys, we're surrounded. not for long. it's morphin time. mastodon. pterodactyl. triceratops. sabretooth tiger. tyrannosaurus. and now the final spell. koo dorsa dorsa dor. kablo kar. o vashar dar bar har shalon. mutitis, now go and eliminate the power rangers.   wow. he's ugly.   we need dinozord power.   all right, rangers. power up your crystals. right. do it. all right. let's go get ugly man. switch to megazord battle mode. megazord sequence has been initiated. megazord activated. let's show him some megazord power.  we got to keep it together, guys. yes. it's moving in closer. yeah, that more like morphin. finster, i made my own monster and it's winning. all right, power rangers if we keep this up, we'll finish them.  it's rita. we'd better keep our guard up. believe this, power punks mutitus is nothing compared to the monster i have installed for you next. beware the terror of lokar.   what's that. rita's learned some new tricks. prepare to meet your destiny, rangers. what lokar's breath of doom does to my monsters and it'll blow you away.  zordon, come in. tommy, the power rangers are in trouble. you must join them in the park immediately. right. i'm on my way. ernie, could you watch those kids for me. yeah, sure. great. i owe you one. hey, guys, listen, to ernie, okay. o great lokar, bend to my will. may your breath make mutitus more horrible still.  all right.  mutitis: feel the power of lokar.    all right, it's tommy.   all right.  all right, rita you and your monster are about to feel the sting of dragonzord power.  way to go, tommy. just get back into this, guys.   eat them, mutitis. lokar, send them to the island. oh, no, it's toxic foam. hang on. we're going down.   ay yi yi yi yi. rita sent the rangers to an island in another dimension. we got to help them. i'm afraid she's placed them beyond my reach. the power rangers are facing their ultimate challange. only one thing can save them now. what can save them. their confidence in themselves. ay yi yi yi yi. be strong, my human friends. what happened. i don't know. one of rita's spells must have transported us here. we survived the transdimensional journey intact. not quite intact. my communicator is gone. and my power coin. mine too. oh, no. scary. oh, man, this is not catch. great. we can't even contact zordon. i guess we're on our own. let's have a look around. yeah. to figure out where we are. this place is starting to freak me out.  weird. feels like these bushes have eyes. man, i could have sworn i just saw this this forget it.  oh, what is that noise. whatever it is, it's seriously out of tune. i knew i saw something. hey, you guys, look. hello. um dodo you think you could help us. you see, rita rita.. stay away, don't come near. that wicked witch sent you here. no friend of hers is a friend to me. you can't fool quagmire, no, siree. was it something i said. did you lose your precious power coins. you'll soon lose more than that. look. oh, great. no coins, a tonedeaf little person now we got an island full of monsters. that we thought we'd destroyed. jason: they're charging. weird. they disappeared. man, what kind of place is this. a place where nothing is real except the danger. welcome to the island of illusion. oh, man, this is too weird. i don't think i can handle this.  what's the matter, zack. that's the matter. the huge snake. can't you see it. can't you see it. what snake. it's going to bite me. there's nothing there, zack. zack, there's no thing. i hate snakes. i hate snakes.  oh, man, get it away from me. zack, really there is no snake there. dude, you're seeing things. i believe rita is trying to make us doubt ourselves and use our fears against us. we can't fight something like that. i don't feel so good. zack, you're fading. if rita makes you doubt and fear soon you're going to disappear. he means your loss of confidence is causing your body to dematerialize. come on, zack, fight it. don't let rita get you. i'm trying. it's no use, power rangers. you can't fight your own worst fears. one by one you shall all fade away forever.  captioned by grant brown )
