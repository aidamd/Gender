ahhh. after 10,000 years, i'm free. its time to conquer earth. alpha, rita's escaped. recruit a team of teenagers with attitude. # go, go, power rangers # # go, go, power rangers # # go, go, power rangers # # mighty morphin power rangers # # power rangers # # power rangers # # go, go, power rangers # # you mighty morphin power rangers # zack. you're disappearing. don't let rita get you, man. fight it, zack. i don't know if i can. you see, it's working just as i planned. zack has lost his confidence and is vanishing into thin air. i shall proceed with phase two. excellent. now that's how an evil plan is supposed to work out. goodbye, power rangers. your molecular integrity is fluctuating in an inverse ratio to your level of selfseteem. what. the move zack doubts himself the less there is of zack. hang on, man. fight rita if you can. only quagmire knows her plan. he's getting fainter. it's no use. i can't beat rita's magic. if only we could contact zordon. yeah, but our communicators are gone. hey, what about that weird little dude we saw. he said he knew rita's plan. what was his name. quincy quasimodo. quagmire. speak my name and i appear. now why did you call quagmire here. it's my friend zack. rita's making him disappear. you're no friend of rita's. then quagmire's glad to greet ya. to keep from getting caught, think a positive thought. is this guy for real. if lack of confidence is the operative factor, it just might work, zack. he's right. try it, zack. okay, if you think it will work. here goes. okay, zackman, think positive. i'm i'm remembering a a really tough fight. look. it's working. keep it up, zack. you're coming back. i didn't think i could win. oh, that nasty knight was tough but i hung in there, and i beat him. i did. i'm here. hey, man, thanks. thanks for the pep talk. my pleasure and welcome back but the key was there inside you, zack. yeah, maybe, but we're still stuck here. so zack has escaped. well, the others will not be so lucky. then you can be the earth's big cheese. dandy. quiet, fools. whoa. without their precious power coins it's only a matter of time. alpha, we must reestablish contact with the power rangers. i don't understand. everything here seems to be working but they still can't hear us. rita's island of illusion is deflecting our communications. keep trying. right, zordon. maybe i can boost our signal if i reroute the main computer's microflux transponder. i i must have gotten my wires crossed. now i've blown the computer's quasitronic fuse. quickly. try the bypass circuit. right. ouch. hurry, it is imperative we contact the power rangers. you hear that, computer. you've got to help save my human friends. yeow. ow. if we don't find our power coins we don't stand a chance. hey, maybe quagmire knows where they are. with my technique you might get home but the coins you seek you must find on your own. on our own. where do we even start. yeah, we already looked ever half the island. my calculations would suggest a 98% probability that our coins are in this direction. all right. let's get started. yes, let's get started with an illusion for kimberly's confusion. no way. i don't believe this. hold, my good friend i spy a defenseless forest creature in need of our assistance. skull: thou speakest truly, monsieur bulk. and 'tis a fine example of genus tartarus colonia. i must come to its aid and with great haste. bulk: au contraire, my noble skull. never in my blissfilled dreams would i ever consider troubling you. allow me. skull. and bulk. being nice. what are you talking about. there's no one there, kim. are you okay. um i don't know. let us partake of this charitable deed together. together. ah, yes. this way. oh. good little friend.  if rita can make them act like that she can make anything happen. she's demolecularizing. quagmire. quick. please help kimberly. a toad might fight you to the marrow, but stay your course straight as an arrow. oh, man, not the toad creature. that was way too gross. i don't know if i want to remember that. you've got to. kimberly, try. if i have to. he was big and he was ugly but i was the only one whose weapon could destroy him. so i just did what i had to do. yes. nice going. you beat the illusion. thank you. putties. everywhere. oh, no. they're with tommy now. you're ganging up on me, huh. hey, dude. what are you doing. tommy. tommy, it's us. come on, man. snap out of it. tons of them. tommy, it's us. what's wrong, tommy. he's seeing things. yeah. cool off, man. yo, tommy. chill, dude, it's us. i'll take you all on. what is the status of your repairs. i'm happy to report, zordon, that i've finished and all systens are go oh. oh. oh. oh. ay yi yi yi yi yi. help help. ay yi yi yi yi yi yi. you. looks like our little friend tommy has lost all confidence in his companions. and before long, my queen all will be lost for the power rangers. i won't let them get me. tommy, it's us. too many. i can't win. trini: oh, no. look. jason: he's fading. help us, quagmire. dude, don't let rita steer you wrong. think strong thoughts. you'll be strong. right. got it. got to be strong. i was all on my own zack: hang in there. please, tommy, don't leave us. but i knew i could do it. and i did it. yes. yes. hi, tommy. curse that tommy. as one shall wind and rain attack fade away, billy and trini never to come back. no, really, there were, like, a zillion putties coming at me but i wasn't scared. i just trini, are you okay. i'm afraid rita might come after me next. that's just what she wants you to think. trini, you're becoming translucent. no. no. billy. billy, you're too high up. billy, you're too high up. billy, you're too high. billy, you're too high up. it's rita's illusions. quick, think posititve. yeah. remember what quagmire said. trini had to conquer height athough it was her greatest fright. now, my child, do your best to pass this part of rita's test. come on. way to go, trini. billy. it's no use. even all my scienctific knowledge can't get us out of this one. it failed. no, billy, it's not your fault. don't let rita get to you. quagmire, rita's after billy. i sense a fight in a land of dreams where billy fought a nightmare queen. i recall the confrontation. she had me in a most impressive grip, but i finally applied sufficient leverage to defeat her. wow. prodigious. yay, billy. morphinominal, you did it. i seem to be completely reconstituted. good. then maybe we can find our power coins and get out of here. if you were a real leader, jason you'd have saved your friends already. he's right. destined leader of the power geeks let my evil magic work on you most of all. she's right. i should have figured a way out. don't listen to her, jase. rita's just trying to make you doubt yourself. no. i should have done something. quagmire, quickly, we need your assistance. dear, oh, dear. nasty magic happening here. billy: we're disappearing. jason, help. help us. no. they're gone. they were depending on me and i let them all down. he can't see or hear us. and it's making him disappear. quagmire: inside, you know your power's great. you can win, just concentrate. yeah i will. i can. you haven't won yet, rita. i remember the time i fought king sphinx. it was looking bad for a while but i didn't give up. i'm back. way to go. all right. rita: i can't believe it. they've beaten all my illusions. look, our communicators. and our power coins. we could have had these all along. yeah, and we each had the power to break rita's spell. all we needed was a little selfconfidence. all: yes. ahh. dummies. i just have to do everything myself.  we got to hurry. it's morphin time. dragonzord. mastodon. pterodactyl. triceratops. sabretooth tiger. tyrannosaurus. they got off the island. all right, let's get them. ready, megadragonzoid. all: power up. attack. megadragonzoid, fight. all right, rangers, full power. huh. lokar, you're next. we call on the power of titanus and the ultrazord. all right, let's finish it. # go, go, power rangers # # go, go, power rangers # all: ultrazord, power up.  it's all over for you, pal. lock on and fire all weapons. # go, go, power rangers # aah. noooo. lokar got away. we'll get him next time. # go, go, power rangers #   another fine effort by bulk and skull. and next is zack. zack, it's your turn. just have fun. you're assured of winning, buddy. something's not right. come on, man, you're the best. you are not losing your confidence. yeah, after all we've been through. just do out there and do it.
