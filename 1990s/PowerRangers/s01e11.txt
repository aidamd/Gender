critical thing she's missing is h20you know, water. what happened to the monster. i don't know. he must have slipped away when the putty patrol showed up. i think he headed for the park. if you disconnect the electrodes i'll apply the water. nothing is happening. i don't understand it. i will reevaluate the amount of water needed. of course. that's it. i have it. more water. detection alert,
