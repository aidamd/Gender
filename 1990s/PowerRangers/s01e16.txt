ahhh. after 10,000 years, i'm free. its time to conquer earth. alpha, rita's escaped. recruit a team of teenagers with attitude. # go, go, power rangers # # go, go, power rangers # # go, go, power rangers # # mighty morphin power rangers # # power rangers # # power rangers # # go, go, power rangers # # you mighty morphin power rangers #  now let's see. that power source for billy's new invention has got to be around here somewhere. hmm. aha. just what i was looking for. i'll just attach this to that and that to this, and bingo.  when billy tests his new gizmo his head will be scrambled like an omelette.  those other power brats will be so busy trying to help him, they won't pay attention to what rita's doing.  goldar: now you can send down a monster. yeah, you're right. and that monster will be the genie. an excellent choice your majesty, as usual. goldar, take a look. this is the chance we've been waiting for. we can finally get rid of the power rangers. attack. kimberly: like, what is this new project. i've been working on this new system to facilitate direct thought transfer. you have a way for me to read your mind. affirmative. i'm still experimenting but i'm sure it will work.  did you hear that. yeah. sounded like a dog. no, numbskull. that geek, billy, invented a machine that can read people's minds. people's minds. if you had a mind to read. imagine the possibilities. the apparatus is somewhat imposing. morphinomenal. watch the 'do, okay. ah, don't worry. i'm certain that my parameters are within the specified range.  okay, now i just have to flip down this microgenerator switch then we're all set.  hey, bulky. shh. are you ready. uhhuh. billy: let me make one more adjustment. bulk. what do you want. oh  nice doggy. are you feeling nominal. like, i think so. billy. kimberly. look, what happened. the, uh, generator experienced diathermic overload. what. we've undergone spatial personality displacement. will you please speak english. my brain's in your body and yours is in mine. what.  goldar: now that we have the magic lamp from canine four of the wolfhead's galaxy those power rangers will be taken care of finally. have you got it. uhhuh. well, what are you waiting. go on. rub the lamp. rub it. of course. whoo.  wow. whoa. are you a genie. at your service. well, what do you know. it worked. genie, you are going to be sent down to earth and there you will attack the power rangers and destroy them. is that understood. your wish is my command.   i saw how he did it. it's a piece of cake. come on. get in there. well, what do you want me to do. when i flip the switch, think of something and i'm going to try and read your mind. hey, bulkcan i think of kimberly. don't tell me, you dimwit. i'll try and read your mind. think. think.    girl: talk about a major grossout. keisha, stephanie, look.  well, i think makeup's overrated anyway. boy: show me how to do file sorting. push shift f4 and then you, uh push this grungy button over in the corner. but that's the delete key. uh, not that corner, silly. kimberly: the project of the day is the cheese souffle.   are you feeling all right. maybe we should do this another day. no. i think we can get this. uh, here it is. why did you do that. like, what's the big deal.  the cheese souffle. ooh.   take cover.  class: aw kimberly squatt: i got only one question. can he beat the power rangers. i shall destroy them. hey, i like this guy. we'll send you down to earth inside the lamp so zordon can't detect your arrival. once he does, it will be too late. right. well, get back in the lamp now.  like, people think i've gone totally mancky. look at the way i've been lookingmy hair, my makeup. yuck. yeah. well, i trusted you with an elementary tutorial and you turned my transmission decoders into a synaptic nightmare. what's wrong. i've never seen you guys arguing before. billy's invention switched our brains. if you're kimberly, then this is somebody who can't put on makeup. my synaptic interlock generators malfunctioned and i'm unable to reverse the personality displacement until i can rebuild it. kimberly, are you in there. afraid so. skull: scarfing time. bulk: yeah, scarfing time. you're breathing on my food. we got to do something. we've got to find that billy geek. oh. right after i've eaten my spaghetti and meatballs. yeah. spaghetti and meatballs. goldar: the putties are ready, your highness. good. those insolent little brats are going to get exactly what they deserve. take the monster down to earth hidden in the lamp and not even zordon will know he's there. now send those two down to earth, goldar. yes, my queen. yikes. go ahead. okaydokey. here goes. careful. you'll drop it. oops. can't you do anything right.  what are we going to do now. there is a dangerous disturbance in the morphing grid, alpha. send the rangers to recover a lamp from angel grove park. right, zordon. i'll get right on it. zack: look, over there. that's it. i got it. look, everybody. i got the lamp. what do you suppose it is. we got to get this thing to zordon. zordon, you said this was an emergency but it's just an antique oil lamp. what's so dangerous about it. the genie who was once inside it. rita was sent him to destroy the power rangers.  it's the putty patrol. ayyiyiyiyi. zordon: let the power protect you. i'll take care of the lamp. mastodon. pterodactyl. triceraptops. sabretoothed tiger. tyrannosaurus. you okay. jason. zordon: goldar and the putties are a diversion. send the rangers to the genie's location. right, zordon. i'm teleporting the power rangers now. aw, man. what is this. i can't move. zordon, the power rangers are in trouble. we must get them out of danger. teleport them here immediately. i just hope we're not too late. that should do it. as you have seen, rangers the genie is powerful. you're right. like major muscle. nevertheless, the power to defeat him resides inside each of you. we couldn't get near him. we never even touched him. how will we beat this guy. by not working our maximum energy linkage. correct. believe in yourselves. combine your powers, and the genie cannot defeat you. all right, power rangers. let's do it. ready to move and in the groove. for sure. that genie's done for, okay. we'll show him that his magic won't work on us. affirmative. that genie is finished. in your face, power rangers. rita. we're going to have a lot of fun.  take a good look at what you're facing now. whoa. rita: now, get them. your wish is my command. go, monster, and destroy the power rangers. remember, together we can beat it so let's do it.  dinozord power, now. let's go. all right. log on. zach here. i'm kickin' it. kimberly. like, really trini. ready to rock. billy. on line. power rangers, power up. two, one power up. let's show him some megazord power. megazord power mode now. megazord sequence has been initiated. megazord activated. the power rangers are in trouble. repeatpower rangers in trouble. danger. danger. zordon: alpha, calm down. trace the source of the genie's power. perhaps that will unlock the secret to defeating him. ayyiyiyiyi. i can't believe it. what have you found. the source of the genie's power. it's it's the lamp. you must dispose of it quickly. right. we'll zap it in the teleporter. not so fast. it must be done carefully. too much power at one time will destroy the morphin grid and everything in it, including the power rangers. ayyiyiyiyi. this isn't going to be easy. keep it together. we got to beat him. he got our servo power circuits. billy, you've got to rewire those servos to bypass the damage and tap into the power morphin system. you got to get us more power before we get totalled. i'll try. kimberly, trinihe'll need help. use your big drill. we've got to hurry, zordon. the power rangers are in trouble. patience, alpha. you must increase the power slowly. the slightest error and we will all be vaporized. saving our planet is not as easy as it used to be.  oh, no. he's got us. yes. zordon, we've got to destroy it right now. just a few more seconds, alpha. but the power rangers don't have a few more seconds. oh, i can't look. now, alpha. full power. look. something's happening.  i've got one of those headaches again. goodbye. alpha: when we destroyed the lamp, the genie disappeared. all set. we got to go. billy and kimberly are about to make the switch. ayyiyi. tell them to be careful. are you sure this will work. uh, in science, nothing is certain. will you pull the swtich. well. what happened. are you guys back to normal. i appear to have regained control ever my snapped neurons. yeah, and i'm me too. please, guys. yeah. please, guys. we want to go back to normal. yeah. normal. have you guys been playing with my machine. should i. maybe we should teach them a lessonnot to mess with other people's property. i think they learned a lesson. all right. step on up. are we back to normal. yeah. normal.  do you suppose i can borrow your brain for my maths test on monday. some people will never learn. captioned by grant brown )
