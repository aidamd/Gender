goldar: why don't you ever talk to him, sire. lord zedd: why did i ever married her. goldar: uh, question. lord zedd: what. goldar: uh, i was just saying. lord zedd: yes. goldar: we can send the power rangers back in time. lord zedd: i already said that. now, go. rocky: so what about you, billy. rita: oh, ghost of darkness. my husband, lord zedd, was sent me before you. ghost of darkness: i heard about the wedding. what can i do for you, my evil child. rita: zedd has come up with a ridiculous plan to get rid of those power brats by sending them back in time. ghost of darkness: the wizard of deception can carry that out but as long as the white ranger leads them. you may never get rid of them completely. rita: my point exactly. you can send the rangers back in time. send them to the moon. send them anywhere. but they have the white ranger to lead them back. ghost of darkness: therefore, you must destroy the white ranger. rita: at last. somebody as intelligent as i am. how do we do it. ghost of darkness: the white ranger is quickthinking. wise and strong. he can only be defeated by another such as he. the wizard of deception will get rid of the others and create the being. who will finally destroy the white ranger. wizard of deception: surprise, zordon. i'm back. rita: ghost of darkness, thank you. lord zedd's going to love this. bulk: okay, skull, i got an idea. wizard of deception: you will do as i command. both: yes, master. wizard of deception: you shall go and seek a human named tommy. and bring yourself along with his hair. so that i call a make of his image and strike. both: yes, master. wizard of deception: now, go. both: yes, master. wizard of deception: humans. rita: oh, finster. finster. finster: yes, my queen. rita: i did it. the wizard of deception is going to create another tommy. finster: why, that's a brilliant idea my queen. rita: yes. with our own little tommy. i can recreate the evil green ranger and defeat those power brats once and for all.

of the green ranger's evil powers. you shall follow all of my commands. tom oliver: i'm here to serve you, wizard of deception. wizard of deception: now, here is what i want you to do. billy: guys,
