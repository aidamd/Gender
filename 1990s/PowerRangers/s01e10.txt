illustrated characterizations is quite impressive, isn't it. what did he say. don't look at me. i don't speak billy. he said i draw a good cartoon. thanks, billy. we've got all the balloons blown up, the banners are made. what else is there left to do. i think we're about done. all we have left to accomplish now is just to make sure that zack doesn't find out about the planned festivities prematurely. hey, you guys, i just saw zack pass by my office window. i think he's headed this way.  hey, ernie. what's with the late hours. just catching up on some work, zack. and i'm all by myself

get real mad. come on. come on. why don't you stop your babbling and help make this sword. this isn't easy work, you know. but i like to babble. what kind of sword is it anyway. a very special one. it can cut through any material in the universe and holds great magical powers. there. almost. ha ha ha. a little more work and it's done. i'll just heat it up again. oh, it's turning out to be a particularly nasty sword, my queen if i do say so myself. there we go. start the spell, your badness. we're nearly through. very well, finster. it better be good. moon of ivory, start of old,
