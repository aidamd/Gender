ahhh. after 10,000 years, i'm free. its time to conquer earth. alpha, rita's escaped. recruit a team of teenagers with attitude. # go, go, power rangers # # go, go, power rangers # # go, go, power rangers # # mighty morphin power rangers # # power rangers # # power rangers # # go, go, power rangers # # you mighty morphin power rangers # i'm enjoyed this so much. i'm sorry to see it end, but when my empress commands  i obey. huh. huh.   there is no escape, jason.  now that goldar has jason right where i want him it's time to call forth scorpina. she'll make mincemeat out of those power geeks starting today.  from deep inside an evil place bring forth a villainess to face the power rangers. with her sting, scorpina to the world will bring her evil ways. come, scorpina. come, green ranger. make my evil unstoppable. come on, alpha. you almost had a lock on zordon. i'm hurrying, rangers. the subgenerator's losing power. alpha: zordon's signal is fading. hurry, alpha. switching to alternate energy source. come on. we're still not getting enough power. zordon's signal's too weak. we've lost him. poor zordon. he's gone again. he was trying to tell us something about the green ranger. he's probably involved in all this. the computer is still trying to locate jason. it's come up with nothing. i have a really bad feeling about this. something isn't right. we'll have to split up and try to find jason. you're beginning to make me angry, human.  where are you. you're only prolonging the inevitable, jason. show yourself. give up. i'll be merciful.   so, goldar, how does it feel to be outsmarted by a human being. no human's ever defeated goldar. i'm going to change that. yeah.  sorry, kimberly. i haven't seen jason for a while. you think he's in trouble. i don't know, ernie. hey. we'll help you find jasonshmason. missing persons are our specialty. thanks, but no thanks. hey, we work cheap. and what is cheap. we take payment in, uh, kisses.  ugh. okay. close your eyes. kimberly, don't do it. come on. ugh. ugh.  sick. yeah, sick.  you kissed me. ernie, if you see jason will you tell him we're looking for him. sure thing, kimberly. thanks. oh, excuse me. tommy. tommy, wait. have you seen jason around. as a matter of fact i waited for him after school, and he never showed. weird. that's not like him. and let me guess. you're worried. right. that is what you do best, isn't it, kimberly. hey, tommy, what's up. what's with him. i wish i knew. did you find out anything. i checked everywhere. no one's seen jason. same here. it's funny. tommy said he was supposed to meet jason after school but he never showed. that's bogus. i know jason was there. then you talk to tommy. probably thinks i'm making this up so i have something to say to him. come on, we'll catch him outside. goldar: i think pink ranger suspects something, your evilness. well then, why don't we have a look and just see what's going on down there. i'll bet that pesky little ranger is up to no good somewhere in the park. ah, yes, kimberly and zack. trying to mess with my green ranger, huh.  yeah, i'll get you. there he is. zack: yo, tommy. yo, tommy. zack. aw, man. talk about bad timing. you okay. yeah. tommy's gone. something is definately up. the putties didn't even attack him. yeah. let's get to the command center. rita: green ranger, it's time. you're not begging for mercy because you know i'd never grant it. goldar, stop. i thought rita wanted me to destroy him. she wants that pleasure to be mine and has ordered me personally to see to his end. so, we meet again. i've been looking forward to this. you wear a green ranger costume yet your loyalty's with rita. i'm her green ranger, and she is my empress. she's evil. yeah, and so am i. see ya. soon you and your friends will be a memory.  we couldn't find jason. we had to leave without him. we couldn't locate him here either. how long till the computer's ready to locate zordon. 15. 2 minutes. i did it. i fixed our wrist communicators. now we can get a fix on jason and teleport him back here.  you are a skilled warrior. i don't want to fight you. because you know i'll win. if you're truly a ranger, then you'd be on zordon's side. zordon is a memory. rita will soon rule the world. oh, no, you don't.  when i think about the terrible things scorpina used to do. yes. they were the worst. now's the perfect time to bring her back. and now that we are together again we can finish the power rangers. please keep your stinger away from me. the time you got him on the head he whined for a week. oh, gosh. we have partial power in the main computer. it's locked on to jason's wrist communicator. can you teleport him here. yeah. it will take a minute. is there anything we can do. just cross your fingers. hold on, jason.  it is over. i am the victor.  what do you think of my sword.  you're about to pay the price of defeat. trini: how much longer. i've almost got it. the suspense is breaking my circuit boards. billy, hurry. for what it's worth you put up a good fight but now the battle is finished.  i've locked on. he's teleporting now. huh. what. no. how. jase, you're back. guys, that was way too close. the green ranger nearly sliced and diced me. green ranger. i got to fill you guys in. you're not going to believe what happend. goldar: you had him at your mercy and you let him escape. he was teleported out, goldar. you had more than enough time to dispose of him. we entrusted you, but as it turns out she should have left me there. give me another chance and trust me, i will destroy them. you may yet get another chance to prove yourself but for now you will remain where you are. it all started at school. i finished talking with tommy wait a minute. you were at school. tommy said you didn't show up. that's weird. the next thing i know, i'm fighting with goldar and he has my power morpher. and then the green ranger shows up and we went at it. did you find out anything more. i can tell you one thing. he's one mean fighter. man, can you believe our enemy this time is another ranger.  what's happening. it's the emergency alarm. ayyiyiyiyi. alpha, what is it. watch the viewing globe. kimberly: who is that. alpha: it's the evil stinging scorpina. i haven't seen her in over ten thousand years. zack: she's launched an attack on the warehouse section. trini: we've got to stop her. good luck, rangers. beware of scorpina's sting. it's morphin time. mastodon. pterodactyl. triceratops. sabretoothed tiger. tyrannosaurus. yeah. yeah. go. yeah. yeah. let's do it. power rangers. go, putty patrol, attack the power rangers.  the battle is grand. and for once we're winning. altough she is a brave warrior, she is greatly outnumbered. she must be called back before it's too late. can we watch it. very well. here i come. jason, are you okay.  i think she's cute. what do you think. am i prettier. oh, yes. you're much more beautiful than scorpina. by far. goldar: ah, scorpina. don't you "scorpina" me. i was at least out there battling with them. perhaps you should send green ranger. children, shush now. green ranger did quite well against the power geeks. he nearly had them until he let jason escape the dark dimension.  do you think i should send the green ranger. i think i don't know what i think. no, send me. i want to go. i can go with baboo. oh, shut up. let's not forget who's the most powerful. you're the most powerful. now that i think of it, you are the most powerful. then i should go, not green ranger. baboo, will you put a cork in it already. i make the decisions around here. and so i've decided that you should do it. goldar: thank you, my queen. i promise i shall not fail you. rita: and i'll work on a spell to cause an eclipse and cut off megazord's solar power when the final battle begins. sometimes, i'm so diabolically brilliant i can't stand myself. to the end of the power rangers. i've worked hard, my queen. i am ready for another chance. rita: patience, green ranger. your time will come. i'll be waiting to crush the power rangers. rita's bound to strike again. we have to keep our guards up. every time rita attacks she pulls back. as if she's holding back getting ready for a bigger battle. the computer's back on line. is it powered up enough to look for zordon. yes, jason. i'm scanning the sector that zordon's signal was in and i think i found something. rangers, can you hear me. we can barely make you out. hang on. alpha, do something. ayyiyi. i've got him but i don't know how to keep him. come on, alpha, you can do it. whoa. alpha: it's not holding. something's drawing power from the center. dangerous and rita's trap we lost him again. magic wand, make my goldar grow.  rangers, look at the viewing globe. there is a major disturbance in downtown angel grove it's goldar. ayyiyiyiyi. zack: goldar's gone off the deep end. we got to stop him. it could be a trap. we don't have a choice. captioned by grant brown )
