'cause he's a quitter. that's what quitters do. i'd rather be a quitter than watch you show off every afternoon for the res of my life. hey, skull, check it out. what. where. right there. man, you're the one that shows off. yeah, you're the one that shows off. what do you say we have a little fun. you'd better stay out of my way. why don't you two just sit down and talk about this. i'm sure it was a misunderstanding. or, of course, you could settle this like men. skull: yeah, like men. come on, you guys, just stay out of this. i'm game , right here and now. make the first move. what's going on here. we were trying to break these two up. it was starting to get a little ugly. i find tha extremely hard to believe. tommy and jason were just practicing their moves for their karate class. right, trini. yeah. right. well, the hallway is not the place. i'm surprised. you two should know better than that. something really awful must have happened between those two. yeah, but what. i don't know. fantastic. your plan's working wonderfully. time to send down the monster. yes. you'll make it happen. the rangers will be finished. right.   seafood gumbo. oh, dear. my new monster, the slippery shark must be ready. let's see. let me at them. let me at them. once on earth, with his lightningfast speed those stupid rangers will never catch him. that's the whole idea. go get them, sharky. i'm here, power rangers.  come out, come out, wherever you are. wow. time for a little fishing expedition. bulk: step right up. get your tickets for the fight of the century. thank you. how much do we have. i lost count. how much did we have before you lost count. uh a dollar. you're worthless, you know that. yo, can i get 20 tickets, man. what's happening, mama. come here often. aiyiyiyiyi. my warning sensors are going crazy. the location of the monster is impossible to pinpoint. you must keep trying, alpha. there it is. no, now it's gone. this is weird. this is really weird.  all right, all right, quiet. stick a sock in it. all right, boys the only rule is: there are no rules.  bulk: last one standing wins. go to your corners, come out fighting. fight. fight. fight. fight, fight, figh all: fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight  oh, no, guys, this is terrible. this confrontation could have disastrous results. we got to do something. guys, guys what do you think you're doing. this is going way too far. why not shake hands and forget it ever happened. no way, zack. we're going to finish this now. remember what you're always telling your students. don't fightnot unless it's the only way you can work things out. get out of our way. it's time to take care of this once and for all. you heard what they said. either buy a ticke or hit the road, zack. come on. yeah. come on. yeah.  saved by the beep. hey, guys. guys. guys, it's time to go.  fight. fight. fight. it's time to go. this has to wait. yeah. we'll finish this later. hey. hey. hey. hey. hey, where's the fight. uh, it's been delayed. just hold on to those tickets and we'll get out of here fast. oh, thank goodness. there you are. slow down, tommy. there's plenty of room for everybody. no need to push. we are tracking rita's monster. behold the viewing globe. this is rita's slippery shark. it is elusive and impossible to pinpoin with our equipment. wow. look at it go. it can fly at incredible velocity and can travel underground its exposed fin tearing through anything in its path. i'm certainly glad i got over my fear of fish. forget it, jason. this one's too much for you. man, you don't stand a chance because you're too slow. who's slow. jason and tommy listen to me very carefully. your anger is not real. rita has used the shark's special powers to turn you against one another. now that they're enemies rita's using tha to destroy our team spirit. is there any way that we can break the spell, zordon. there is only one way to reverse the effects. they must put aside how they feel about each other and work together to capture this creature. can we do anything. you and the other rangers stand by. it will take all of you to destroy this monster. i got this part. don't think about it. both: it's morphin time. dragonzord. tyrannosaurus. if i destroy the shark i take over as leader of the power rangers. if i get it first, turn in your power coin. fine. fine.  all right, fish lips. show yourself. talk about fast. this will slow you down. whoa. back off.  catch me if you can. oh, man. all right. come on. where are you. all right. come on. where did you go. see you. come on. get back here. where is he. i told you. stay out of my way. knock it off, big shot. tommy, i've had it with you. oh, yeah. i'll call the shots. i would lay a lowground attack and catch him when he pops up. that's why i'm the leader. you have to catch him in the air. you think you're so smart. let's just see which plan works. stay out of my way. whatever. move. here i go, trolling for rangers.  whoa. there he is. man, this guy's fast. get back here. where did he go. did you see him. i was right behind him. we've got to do something. you just stay out of my way. this shark will make history out of us if we don't star working together. what do you say, bro. i'm in, buddy. let's combine both plans. now.  let me out of here. i can't move.  we did it. yeah. fellas, give a fish a break, will you. you should have thought of tha before trying to break us up. united we stand. right, partner. you got it. yes. they did it. it would appear tha rita's spell's been broken. all right, then. you leave me no choice. ha. who wants to take on me and my boomerang fish. ha. we're going to need some help here.  it's morphin time. mastodon. pterodactyl. triceratops. sabertoothed tiger. later, losers. he's gone underground. keep your eyes open. he's really fast. there he is. maybe the power axe will help. ooh. that smarts. what did you have to do that for. it's time for the megablaster. my shark. power axe. power bow. power daggers. power lance. power sword. magic wand make my monster grow. all: power rangers. no. wait. fire. missed me.  all right, guys. we need dinozord power now.  let's do it. rangers. log on. kimberly, set to fly. let's fry this fish. zack here. ready. billy. all systems go. power up your crystals. two, one. power up. let's go. megazord activated. time for dragonzord power.   okay. if you wan to be that way, take this. shark breath, you've had it. it's time we powered up the power sword now. he's too fast. grab the fin and let dragonzord take him. # go, go, power rangers # let go. let go. no fair. # go, go, power rangers # # go, go, power rangers # # mighty morphin power rangers # i'm going to turn you into fish bait. ohh. my fin. you're going to pay for that. # go, go, power rangers # or maybe not. let's finish him off. # go, go, power rangers #  # go, go, power rangers # # mighty morphin power rangers. # one, two. one. one, two. one. one, two. one. one, two. one. one, two. it's really reassuring to see tommy and jason working together as a team now that rita's spell's been broken. it was weird seeing them go at each other. one. one, two. one. one, two. one. one, two. everyone, take a break. what happened to you guys, or is this a new style. very funny. you owe us a fight. sorry, guys. can't help you.
