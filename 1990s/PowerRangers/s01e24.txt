ahhh. after 10,000 years, i'm free. its time to conquer earth. alpha, rita's escaped. recruit a team of teengers with attitude. # go, go, power rangers # # go, go, power rangers # # go, go, power rangers # # mighty morphin power rangers # # power rangers # # power rangers # # go, go, power rangers # # you mighty morphin power rangers # ernie: hey, guys. i gotta step out for about an hour and pick up some supplies, but you could work on your float while i'm gone. thanks a million, ernie. hey, no problem. good luck. i can't believe a float i designed is gonna be in the big parade. it deserves to be. it's awesome. thanks, tommy. it is, like, so cool to be part of a parade that promotes world peace. bulk: ahhh. so. what do we have here. what are you guys doing here. oh, look. it's a cute little model float. yeah, a cute little model float. hey, back off. nice flow flowers. oh, gross.   my allergies.   rita: i just might have a float of my own to enter into that parade. baboo: they make them out of flowers.  daisies, eh.. if you hadn't gone and eaten all those sunflower seeds, but then i wouldn't have such a sunny disposition. they'll have no world peace while i'm around. ahhh hey, those are cool flowers. you know what the best part is. what. they're gonna recycle all the flowers from the parade this year. really. how do they do that. it's really simple. they just collect them all and then they turn them into potpourri. hmmm. we have trouble.   oh no, putties. don't come back, clay brains.  look at my model. man they really demolished it. without this model, i can't build the fullsized float. now it won't be able to be in the parade. oh, kim. cheep up. there'll be other parades you can design floats for. yeah, but rita will probably wreck them too. well, perhaps we can simply reconstruct it.  all that time and effort for nothing. we could help you build a new one. yeah. there's no way we can get more flowers in time. the model's due today. this rita's a real witch. oh, poor kimberly. what i need now is a very special monster. got any suggestions. oh, no. i am not worthy to make a suggestion to you. how about a giant cucumber with bad breath.. finster: o, my queen. you have so many monsters to choose from today. finster. start thinking flowers. i need a monster that will turn pretty blossoms into ferocious fighters. i have a very rare monster known as the flora expertorosis. it's more commonly known as the spitflower. it gobbles up flowers by the ton and then spits them out again as ferociously fanged biting blooms. the blossoms draw all the energy from anyone they bite. oh, it's a strong monster, my queen, i'm sure it will do. i want one. make it. immediately. immediately. one spitflower coming right up.  hey, i know. let's take her out to lunch. that should cheer her up. that all the pieces we could locate. man, what a bummer. yeah, you know kimberly really had her heart set on having a float in the parade. i wish there was something we could do. i've got an idea. we'll deal with it later, though. i gotta go. you gonna be okay. yeah, i'll be fine. the guys wanna take you out of lunch, but i gotta go and take care of something. can i drop this stuff off at your house. no just toss it. i don't need it around to remind me of the parade. yeah, okay. i'll catch you later. bye. we'll show rita it's not that easy to defeat the power rangers.  yeah, zordon. power rangers, i need you at the command center immediately. right. kimberly. zordon needs us at the command center right away. c'mon. prepare to teleport. rita wants to destroy the flower power peace parade. that means she'll destroy all of the floats. ai yi yi yi yi. she has just unleashed a new monster on angel grove. behold the viewing globe. it is called the spitflower, to turn every flower in angel grove into an evil and ferocious blossom. ai yi yi yi yi. those are dangerous daisies. with that thing around, nobody's gonna be safe. and peace on earth will be dealt yet another blow. the spit flower's body is like armor with few weak spots. you must avoid his claws and fangs. man, that is one ferocious bug. i have located the spitflower near the park bridge. it's morphin time. mastodon. pterodactyl. triceratops. sabretooth tiger. tyrannosaurus. all: power rangers.   uh. these things are really diggin' in. i'm getting weak. me too. they're draining our energy.  i can barely move. they're taken away all of our strength.   i have them now. magic wand, make my monster grow.  gotta get rid of these flowers.   zordon: tommy, the power rangers need you at angel grove park. right. dragonzord. noooo. man, that was close. way to go, tommy. tommy. are you guys okay.. c'mon. let's get him.  look out. jason: all right, rangers, listen up. we need dragonzord power. tommy. power it up. right. coming up.  all: we need dinozord power now. megadragonzord transformation now. let's do it. megdragonzord online.   we're losing power.  alpha: the power rangers are down, zordon. flower power is too much for the dragonzord. ai yi yi yi yi. alpha, bring them back to the command center. we must regroup. the monster almost trashed the dragonzord. i never thought flowers could be dangerous. alpha, track the spitflower. right. it's coming up on the viewing globe now.  zordon: i have retrieved your zords and returned them to their hiding places. for as you can see, they were ineffective against the spitflower. his strength grows with every minute. flowers are on the attack all over town. zordon: alpha, begin an analysis of the last battle.    don't stop for me, bulk. save yourself. okay.  ow. ow.      my allergies.  your allergies. get 'em off me. can't get 'em off me.  how are we gonna stop that thing. the analysis of your recent battle has located the spitflower's weak point. if you destroy the spitflower's mist sack, he will be unable to produce any more biting bloomers and his strength will be reduced. you think you can hit that with your power bow. no problem. i'll show rita not to mess with me. all right then, let's move. zordon: tommy, you must stay here. if the power rangers fail, you will be our last hope. okay. you may monitor them on the viewing globe. go get him, kim. all right, let's bring them together. power axe. power bow. power daggers. power lance. power sword. all: power rangers. # go, go, power rangers # all: fire. yeah. we got him. yes. the power rangers have done it. now that they've defeated that monster, alpha, i need your help with something back at the garage. oh. all right. pliars. no, alpha. that's a wrench. those are pliars. right. pliars. good, alpha, good. okay, now all i need is a shot of glue. no, no, alpha, that one. we gotta hurry, alpha. where's the glue. right here in my hand. alpha, let's go. i'm trying. ai yi yi yi yi. alpha, you're too much. can't you lunkheads do a simple thing like destroying a world.. do i have to do everything myself..  you're worthless, did you know that.. and what do you two have to say for yourselves.. don't feel so bad, my queen. everyone makes stupid mistakes now and then. oh, no. he didn't mean that, rita, you've never made a mistake. what'd i say.. what'd i say..  how come i never get to win.. man, we've fought some ugly monsters, but that spitflower. yeah, that was the worst. we glad we got to it, though, before it got to the parade. speaking of parades yo, ernie, what's up on the parade. did it start yet. hurry up. it's just about to begin. tv: and this is angel grove high's marching band and drill team with a patriotic tribute. i just love parades, don't you, jason. yeah, i wish we could have gotten kimberly to go down there in person. what is with the binoculars, billy. they make me feel like i'm there.  hi, guys. hey. what's up. i thought i said i didn't wanna watch the parade. but you have to. tv: here's a special award winner designed by a high school student from from angel grove high. it symbolizes world peace and togetherness. this float competed against hundreds from all over the country andis that my float.. all: surprise.  tommy put it back together in time. thank you, tommy. hey, babe, how about a hug for me too. hey, why don't you guys just buzz off. maybe we wanna watch the parade too, tommy. tell you what, watch this. the hand is quicker than the eye.   captioned by
