tall. and then we crush him. hmm. finster, have you figured out a monster yet. not quite. you shouldn't have said that. you're in trouble. finster, what do you mean. are you losing your touch. if you

you're trying to break the bench press record. yeah.  um, new watch. yeah, bye. put it on my tab. where are you guys going. zordon, we read you. power rangers, rita repulsa is at it again. it is imperative that you teleport to the children's theatre in the park immediately. what's going on. she has sent down a team of putties and an unknown monster in a attempt to gain control of the park. be careful. and let the power protect you. it's morphing time, guys. mastodon. pterodactyl. tyrannosaurus. attack. yay. oh, goodie. let's finish these putties. don't waste time fighting you brainless

real fighting. hyah. you're nothing without your friends. why don't you give up. yeah, get him. take that. these guys are too much. man, i wish the other guys were here. ha ha. trini, billy. jason's

now. yeah, let's go. alpha, adjust the morphing grid and locate jason on the viewing globe. ah, there. ha ha ha. zordon, this seems hopeless. indeed it would, trini, were it not for your power crystal. of course. put your hands together and bring forth the power crystals. the crystals contain the essence of your morphing powers. use them to find each other in any peril, and with your zords to draw power from the very heart of the morphing grid. i'm sending the crystals directly to jason. once in his possession, you will be able to join him and stop king sphinx and goldar. together, they are nearly unbeatable, so call your zords quickly and let the power protect you. and send the crystals through jason's zord. hurry, alpha. he doesn't have much time. ah, man. this is not looking good. whoa. yeah. all right. aah. power crystals. way to go, zordon. hey, ugly, i want you to meet some of my friends. uhh. now you're gonna see what friends working together can do. dinozord power. all
