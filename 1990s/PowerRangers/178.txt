blue power ranger: i'll teleport back to the command center. billy: alpha. zordon. i know you must have a good reason for disappearing like this, but we really need you. maybe they had an energy spike and had to shut down. i'll try the access code.  whoa.  alpha 5: should i set up the intermorphing sequencer before i regulate the energy converters, zordon. zordon: yes, alpha. meanwhile, i'll test the phase capacitance program. alpha 5: there, sequencer is online and working properly. i'll start on the converter now. zordon: be careful, alpha. a small mistake in the energy flow could spell disaster. alpha 5: right, zordon. billy: amazing. alpha 5: starting now. )
