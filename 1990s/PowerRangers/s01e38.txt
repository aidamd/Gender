oh, yeah.  she ducked. shut up, moonbrain. gee, bulk, this is better than mom makes. thanks for sharing.  ah, man, do we have to put up with this all afternoon. now for phase two. it's going to feel so good to see those rangers get what they deserve. no mercy.  surprise.  man, this stinks. yeah. it's like we're being blamed for something we didn't do. oh, boy. it's time for my favorite cartoon.  out of my way, pighead. but, bulk, i want to see too. hmm. what a remarkable display of early neanderthal socio contact.   announcer: we interrupt this program for a special report. the mighty morphin power rangers, who once fought on the side of justice as the defenders of our planet, have now joined with the forces of evil. say what. the power rangers would never join the forces of evil. this tragic turn of events began as the power rangers staged a terrifying attack on downtown angel grove just moments ago. this attack took the city by surprise. but that's impossible. man, the power rangers are being framed. today, the power rangers are behaving like the hoodlums they once put out of business. it is a dark day for angel grove all right. all right. and the entire world. the power rangers wouldn't join the forces of evil. of course not. this is rita's doing. she's reached a new low. i just can't believe it. this is one of rita's most evil plans ever. we've got to stop those phony rangers before they destroy the world. we could just morph. we can't reveal our identities to bulk and skull. hey, caplan just took off. now's our chance to sneak out. let's follow her. i wouldn't. she'll be back. three, two, one and stay in. amateurs. girl: attention, students. due to the current emergency no one may leave the school until further notice. have a nice day. man: we're back with live coverage of the current crisis in angel grove. the magnitude of this crisis is increasing as is the amount of destruction. all efforts to stop the power rangers have failed and the city, perhaps the world, is at their mercy. morphin is the only way. but how. i've got an idea. hey, skull. you want to see a magic trick. sure. geek, show us something we haven't seen. you mean, like the alphabet. all righ check this out. i can make us disappear. no way. yes way. all right, but firs cover your eyes. and coun backwards from ten. now, plug your ears with your fingers and then count backwards. ten nine uh, seven skull: uh, eight uh six. eight seven skull: nine it's morphin time. mastodon. pterodactyl. triceratops. sabertoothed tiger. tyrannosaurus.  now. nine don't forget to tell us when we can open them. seven  yeah, that's it. beat them, my rangers. you don't stand a chance. all: yeah. all: not. oh, yeah. you want to bet. you can't figh the real thing, scorpina. seven eight seven uh eight. wait, i already said that. i give up. seven hey. they're gone. seven what did you do with them. i can't hear you. hey. they're gone. nothing gets past you. come on, we got to find them. all: power rangers. get them. trini, help. if you're hur just stay behind me, and i'll hurt. don't make me laugh. hold on, trini. uhoh. are you okay. yeah. are you sure it's you. watch. no. oh, those power rangers are doing it again. i can't stand it. i just can't stand it. not in there. not in there. ha.  they're no in there either.  farewell, power brats. mirrors, mirrors all around, smash the rangers to the ground. this guy's getting on my nerves. and to think i always liked mirrors. let's get him. you're finished. light blasters up. fire. all right, power rangers let's bring them together. right. power axe. power bow. power daggers. power lance. power sword. power rangers. fire. # go, go, power rangers # all: power rangers. it's terrible how those evil twins tried to frame you. we knew you wouldn't let us down. not the real power rangers. and so, the power rangers are cleared of all wrongdoing and, once again, have made the world a safer place. finster. i've got to have a better monster to beat these guys. out of my way. i've got a headache. they're not in there either. hey, bulk, i have an idea. why don't we turn those goody twoshoes in. let's do it. hey, mr. caplan. those goodygoodys split. sure, bulk. scum's honor. just go in and check. all right, but if they're in there you guys will be doing detention at age 50. so what's another two years. put a lid on it, nincompoop. all: good afternoon, mr. caplan. hey, how did you do that. magic. with mirrors like this one.  i hope you all learned a lesson. we sure did. and i'll see you two tomorrow. right.
