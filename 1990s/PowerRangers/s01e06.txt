consume the entire supply of food on earth in 48 hours. this pig must be stopped. look at that thing. it is so gross. greetings, dudes and dudettes. i thought i'd give you a hand with the food for the

responsible. we almost have enough money for the playground equipment despite all this. with a little help, mr. caplan, we can make up for the rest. let's see what you've got i'll take this. that'll cost you $20. $20. for the playground equipment. okay. i'm starving. with all this craziness, i didn't eat lunch today. oh, no, not that one, mr. caplan. it's a little bit oh, water. i need water. ahh
