ahhh. after 10,000 years, i'm free. its time to conquer earth. alpha, rita's escaped. recruit a team of teenagers with attitude. # go, go, power rangers # # go, go, power rangers # # go, go, power rangers # # mighty morphin power rangers # # power rangers # # power rangers # # go, go, power rangers # # you mighty morphin power rangers # zordon: cyclopses is one of rita's most terrifying creations. she hasn't brought him ou in over 10,000 years. you'll have to defeat him if you are to release angel grove's population from the dimensional vortex in which rita has them trapped. goldar has taken over piloting cyclopses with backup from lokar. the situation is grave. if you don't win this battle soon angel grove and the entire world is doomed. we got to stop that thing. billy, what's the update on the zords. still not fully reenergized. they took a beating in the figh against cyclopses. the zords need another 12 hours to be at full power. we can't wait that long. we'll take them at half power. if we do tha we risk doing serious damage to the zords. we don't have a choice. there is too much danger in what you proposed. zordon, what about our city. we have to stop i from being destroyed. not to mention rescuing all those people trapped in rita's dimensional vortex. they're safe now but if we have to wait 12 hours, it may be too late. what you're asking has never been tried before. if the zords' backups fail you and everything in the morphin grid could vanish forever. do you really wan to try this. you know we do, zordon. yeah. you've got it. affirmative.  between cyclopses and lokar, the world will now be mine. coordinates are set. are you ready to morph to the city. ready, alpha. good luck and let the power protect you. it's morphin time. mastodon. pterodactyl. triceratops. sabertoothed tiger. tyrannosaurus. # go, go, power rangers # # go, go, power rangers # all: all right, let's do it. back for more. lokar will take care of you for good. right, lokar. you'll pay for that. power grids down. switch to emergency power. we can't. backups are down. victory is mine. take that. shields are down. one more hit, and we're finished. we got to do something fast. right. i just hope dragonzord's powered up enough to help.   there it is. oh, no. he's down. power pods are gone. we can't move. weapons are out. i can't believe it. lokar: they're all yours, rita. power rangers, got you. wowee. the power rangers are finished. yeah, i'm going to enjoy this. take that. yeah.  it's overloading. circuits are out. rangers, abandon ship.  you guys okay. yeah. yeah. jason to command center. jason to command center. we have an emergency. rita's undoubtedly jamming the frequency. we've lost our contac with zordon and alpha. and the zords. they came apart. they just dissolved. that was the new security system zordon designed for the zords. if they lose in battle, they disassemble and return to the hiding place to reenergize. so the zords aren't destroyed. negative. the problem is we have no way of contacting them. i might have the equipmen to change the frequency on the communicators. then let's move. alpha, status report. their zords are safe and being reenergized. what abou the power rangers. we haven't heard from them in a while. their communicator frequency is being blocked. keep trying, alpha. you must establish contac with the power rangers. without the zords, they are vulnerable to rita's attacks. aiyiyiyiyi. starting frequency search now. billy: trini, check over there. okay. did you find it. yeah. how does it look. i've go all the equipment i need. it's jus a matter of time. even if he fixes the communicators and establishes contac with zordon, then what. hopefully, zordon's already come up with a plan or this truly is the end of the power rangers. do you see that. i'm winning. yes. without zordon and the zords the power rangers are ripe for defeat. right. then i'll go and personally finish each of those power geeks myself. that's great. now get down there. how's it coming, billy. i'm adjusting the modulator to read an alternative signal. i need a few more minutes. your few minutes are up. goldar. greetings, power rangers. i though i'd stop by and say hello. before i say goodbye forever it's been nice knowing you.  jason, the equipment. keep working, billy. we'll take care of goldar. still living in a fantasy, huh. you're about to learn a lesson.  any success in finding the rangers. it's impossible with their communicators down. i've just found some important information, zordon. it appears that because rita's palace is now on earth our computer has been able to penetrate her data bank. that means we have access to her files of spells and secrets. affirmative, zordon. these files could help us reduce rita's power or even stop her altogether. i'd better hurry and tie into her system. you guys i did it. they're functional. impossible. we're out of here. no. rangers, you're okay. zordon. are you all right. yeah, we're all in one piece. there's no time to waste. we may be able to defeat rita. how. alpha discovered a weakness in cyclopses we can use. what do we do. cyclopses will adjus to whatever it fights. if you change battle modes, he will not keep up. are the zords powered up. ready and waiting for you. each time you change cyclopses will weaken as it adjusts. use this to your advantage. titanus is now reenergized and is ready for action. when the time is righ call upon the power of ultrazord. if you fire on cyclopses in its moment of weakness you will be able to destroy it. there's no time to lose. remember, the quicker you change modes the weaker cyclopses becomes. it's morphin time. mastodon. pterodactyl. triceratops. sabertoothed tiger. tyrannosaurus. all: power rangers. all right, let's get to work. tyrannosaurus power. i call on the power of the mastodon. prodigious. triceratops power. i call on the power of the pterodactyl. i call on the power of the sabertoothed tiger. all: yeah. yeah, yeah. give me your best shot. switching to megazord now. megazord sequence has been initiated. megazord activated. go, zord, now. you can't win, rangers. time to bring in dragonzord power.   dragonzord fighting mode. titanus now. ultrazord, power up. go, go, power rangers you two have had it.  all right, rangers, let's finish them. ramrod and fire. cyclopses: overload. overload. too many changes. system locked. no, i don't believe it. it can't be. abandon ship. #
