aisha: their completely destroyed. adam: this is unbelievable. kimberly: we got to go back to the command center. maybe alpha can figure it out a way to fix them. billy: if only a simple. tommy: oh, man. looks like we're lost more of our zords. we lost our powers completely. billy: there's got to be a long walk to the command center. let's get going. billy: oh, man. what a mess. tommy: come on, billy. give us some good news. billy: wish i could. we're been talking about the command center's power core. i don't even know how can repair it. adam: what about our zords. can you bring them back. zordon: i'm afraid not. aisha: there's got to be something we could do. adam: where did our powers come from in the first place. zordon: legends has it there's a lost temple of hidden beyond the desert of despair. the keeper of the temple is name ninjor. he forms the original power coins to be used by those battling evil forces of the universe. but this may only be a bit. alpha 5: what about the map along with the power coins. rocky: map. hey, maybe it does exist. maybe we could find the temple. aisha: and find the power. tommy: we have to take it. billy: tommy's right, zordon. we can't just give up. zordon: very well. although against my better judgement. i will and alpha give you a map. but i m must warned you. once lord zedd will learns the desternation he will try to forger every move. without your powers you'll be as mercy. tommy: powers or not. we don't have a choice. zordon: remember, stay alert and be prepared for an inspected. alpha, are you ready. billy: keep going, alpha, it's working. zordon: good luck, rangers return to us safety. alpha 5: everyone, please be careful. oh, zordon, i hope we do the right thing. zordon: try not to worry, alpha. if the temple does exist. the rangers are the only ones who can find it. kimberley: guess this is it. billy: well, according to the map that alpha gave us. we started that direction. the entrees to the temple is marked by very extincted rock formation. rocky: what is that. guy: you boys look to enroll junior police patrol. bulk: hey, where do you think you're going. rito: well, i said before i want to bring a special wedding present for you and zedd here. rito: so, uh, what was i saying. oh, yeah the eggs. just can't remember. rito: yep. for you and my favorite sister. rito: sure did. rita: i could kiss you. rita: hey, what was with that egg. rito: no. there's very important about that egg. i just forgot what it is. kimberly: man, hope we got here soon my feet are killing me. rito: now i remember about that egg. rita: i got it. i got it. kimberley: boy, i missed teleporting. i will never take it for grant it. tommy: i hear that. hey, billy, how much further. billy: let me take a look. well, it's not very clear but uh, if i'm not mistaken. we should be coming up on a circle rock formation pretty soon. this way. rocky: what you got, billy. billy: that way. kimberley: hey, you guys look at this rock. aah. adam: it's a trap. aisha: come on, guys. come on. billy: jump, kimberly. rocky: hurry, billy. adam: come on. tommy: let's get out of here. aisha: come on. rocky: let's go. billy: oh, no. the map. tommy: it's gone, billy. aisha: what are we going to do. billy: i don't know. adam: what sort of rock are we looking for, billy. billy: well, if i correct call from the map. we'll know what we'll see it. rocky: there's gotta be around here somewhere. aisha: that was too close. thanks you guys. rocky: you alright. billy: hey, guys. wait a second. aisha: what is it, billy. billy: i think that's the rock formation when we looking for. without the map i can't be certain. but if i'm right. the entrance to the temple should be consider somewhere near the base. rocky: we better check this out. billy: right. look for anything for caves or everything that would endicate opening in the rock. adam: i don't understand. i don't see anything. are you sure this is the rock. billy: well, is the only thing that remotely ever resembles the formation. tommy: looks like zedd found us. rocky: oh, man. can't this get any worse. tommy: whoa. heads up. billy: kimberley, come on. oh, man. these are serious. rocky: their too strong. aisha: they got us conered. tommy: guys, over here. adam: now, where. billy: i don't know. but we can't stay in here forever. adam: look, guys. this rock look back. aisha: i don't know. this really creepy. adam: come on. tommy: everybody, okay. kimberly: yeah, i think so. aisha: this is weird. we should probably follow the tunnel to the end it will probably lead us to safety. adam: and if we're lucky to the temple. aisha: where are we. billy: i'm not exactly sure. billy: we need to look for any light filtering through. that would indicate some kind of opening. adam: looks like the end of the road, guys. tommy: i don't believe it. rocky: perfect. it's a dead end. tommy: man. i drove ov kimberly: tommy. rocky: what happened to him. kimberly: billy, where he go. billy: it appears there some kind of power vortex there. adam: we gotta go after him. aisha: yeah. )
