stone: it's all in the days work. tommy: alright. stone: oh, no, you don't, skull. stone: what's going on. rocky: what's happening. tommy: i don't know. come on, let's go. stone: we better get out of here. tommy: zordon. zordon. oh, man. he's not answering. we better check this out. billy: well, it's dark enough. i've doubt bulk and skull are super gone for few seconds. on, no. alpha's offline. kat: all the computers are down. tommy: zordon. rocky: he's gone. rita: what. what's happening. lord zedd: who dares enter unannouced. master vile: what. who dares to ask a question of me, master vile. lord zedd: master who. rita: zeddy... lord zedd: what, rita. you know this intruder. rita: meet... master vile, my... father. rito: hi, dad. tommy: zordon, what happened. tommy: what sort of evil pleasant. zordon: master vile, rita's father. rocky: rita has a father. adam: nice family tree. first, rito and now this. zordon: alpha and i have been working on a new defence to protect you in battle a powerful metallic armor. adam: metallic armor. alpha 5: the metallic armor defence shield will be build directly into your suits. zordon: the armor tabs directly into the morphing grid. to receive the power use the word command "metallic armor, power up". tommy: alright. cool. zordon: but, be warned, rangers. the metallic armor should be use only for emergency situation. the effects of your powers could be much more dramatic and should be called upon with extreme caution. billy: the metallic armor is really cool, zordon. but we still need the falconzord and ninjor. but, rita and zedd still have bot of them. bulk: hey, where they all go. kat: guys, we have another problem. bulk: where are they. stone: we need someone to ride for help. any volunters. step forward. i knew you can count on you, two. master vile: you married, lord zedd. lord zedd: i may not have a skull. but i have captured the falconzord as well as the great ninjor. what do you have to say now. master vile: i don't believe it. rito: but, it's true, dad. look. whoa. both: ooh. ninjor: ah, ha. i'm free at last. you'll never catch me now. master vile: how could you let him get away. rito: gee, pop. i'm sorry. it just happened. master vile: get him. rita: help him out, you bufoons. baboo: okay. rita: what is that. master vile: this just say it evolves a certain crystal. the zeo crystal to be exact. ninjor: looking for me, boys. rito: huh. ah, ha, ha. ninjor: the zeo crystal will never be yours, vile. master vile: seize, him. ninjor: bye, bye. tommy: ninjor. ninjor: hello, rangers. i'm afraid we have important matters to discuss. master vile has evised the fendish plot. zordon: just as i suspected. ninjor: he wants the zeo crystal. kat: the zeo crystal. zordon: rangers, the zeo crystal is the one of the most powerful forces in the universe. ninjor: thousands of years ago. the people of galaxy m51 hid it from master vile deep inside the caves of destruction. they then place the force field around the crystal preventing is not pure of heart from even touching it. tommy: we can't take that chance i'll get to it. where are the caves of destruction. zordon: i'm afraid the cave of destruction are on the moon itself. directly beneath rita and zedd's palace. ninjor: as you know, zedd took over the alien powers above the caves. his evil corrupted the good in the palace. but can not destroy the pure good in the cavens below. zordon: we thought the crystal would be safe from zedd. but, master vile is much older and infinite wiser in the ways of evil further. the crystals powering increasing with time. if master vile gets the zeo crystal, he could rule the entire universe. rita: he's right, daddy. lord zedd: very funny, rita. master vile: don'y you worry. father's home. rito: yeah. master vile: and i'm going to take care of everything. lord zedd: what is it. master vile: rito and monkey boy are coming with me to my space skull. rita: where's that miserable creature going. lord zedd: relax, rita. i'll tell you in the moment. looks liek your dad's space skull is heading tours earth. rito: are we there yet, dad. are we. rito: uh, we'll watch from here. you go get them, pop. master vile: behold the blue globber. rito: so, what are you going to do now. master vile: i'm going to correct your mistake and capture ninjor. goldar: what could will they do. i thought you wanted the zeo crystal. rito: yeah. master vile: exactly. with ninjor's powers to globber monster to capture zordon's teenagers. and we will use them to free the zeo crystal. rito: ah, ha. and then... come on. sounds like... two words. come on. master vile: then, i will use the crystal's power to rule the universe. master vile is back. lord zedd have you fed, the tengas. lord zedd: yes, i am. rita: of course. we have, father dearest. master vile: excellent. order the tengas to attack the humans. goldar: oh, yes. master vile: stay closely, rito. rito: yeah. master vile: and learn how

#1: oh, no. shinny new rangers. white power ranger metallic armor: ha, ha. this metallic armor is incredible. emergency over. billy: zordon, we're ready using metallic armor on the tengas. but, never been that strong. zordon: i was afraid it comes to this, billy. the situation is deterian sooner than i thought it would. tommy: yeah. we've gotta get back to the falconzord and stop master vile from getting the zeo crystal. zordon: then, one of you must capture the zeo crystal and destroy it. billy: wait a minute. you don't mean. zordon: yes, billy. one of you must journey to the caves of desception underneath rita and zedd's palace. tommy: we don't have a choice, guys. i'll go. kat: so do i. tommy: no way, kat. kat: tommy, if you wanna get through the cave of desception. you gonna need someone take rita and zedd occupied. tommy: are you sure you wanna do this. tommy: we'll try our best, zordon. right. pink power ranger: someone's coming. quick, let's hide. white power ranger: over here. aisha: how are we gonna operate the shogun and the ninja megazords at the same time. billy: you see this device as soon hooked in the command center's computers. it imitates the falconzord's energy readings. rocky: it's good work, billy. billy: thanks. i just hope is enough though. ninjor: ow. what a headache. huh. ninjor: i remember. you won't get away with this, vile. ninjor: let me go, you villain. alpha 5: oh. master vile is launching a attack. zordon: rangers, you must defend angel grove. red power ranger: red shogun zord, power up. blue power ranger: blue shogun zord, power up. black power ranger: black shogun zord, power up. yellow power ranger: yellow shogun zord, power up. blue power ranger: i need to adjust this system for the device to work. black power ranger: okay, i'll scan the city for master vile's monsters. blue power ranger: great, adam. this system changes are complete. but it's gonna take me a couple minutes to install a remote. red power ranger: we better hurry. we don't have any time to spare. blue power ranger: got it. once the device is activated. the ninja megazord's should be on his way. here goes. ninja megazord remote, online. let's hope this works. black power ranger: i'm picking up a monster in the middle inside of that abandon buildings. red power ranger: let's go. lord zedd: master vile. red power ranger: whoa. what's going on. black power ranger: we're losing power. fast. blue power ranger: the monster absorbing the shogun megazord 's power from the distance. that means he can get into the ninja megazord, too. red power ranger: the monster drains both of our megazords. we're history. rita: yeah, that's gonna happened. hey, wait a minute. that voice. )
