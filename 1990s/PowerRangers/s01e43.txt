rangers # # mighty morphin power rangers # # power rangers # # power rangers # # go, go, power rangers # # you mighty morphin power rangers # boy: okay, later. i can't wait to go scuba diving. wait till you guys see the reef that i found. you're not going to believe it. i'll bet we'll see some really big fish down there. uh, you don't have to go that far. some of the biggest fish are right here. don't count on seeing the big ones, dorks 'cause they're going to be at the end of my hook. yeah. his hook. ah. my stuff. gross, bulk. that's disgusting. what do you mean. that's perfectly good bait. yeah. it will make us irresistible with the fish. just like with the ladies. right, trini. get a life, skull. what are you yapping about. get the stuff. there's fish waiting to be caught. let's go fi  look, bulk, i caught one already. bulk, take it easy. i don't think the fish need to be too worried about those two. billy, why don't you come with us. i'm a certified diving instructor. my apologies, jason but i have a regrettable dislike for fish. how about you, kimberly. there's no reason to spoil a perfectly good hair day. billy and i are going to the park for a picnic. a carefully planned distance from any fish substance, i might add. ha. billy doesn't like sea creatures, huh. this is the perfect time to bring out your toxic goofish and destroy them all. what are you waiting for. get to it, goldar. jason: okay, you guys, before we head out, let's do a final equipment check. zack: yeah, 'cause like you always say, safety first, right, man. trini: i can't wai to get down there with the fish and plant life. it's going to be beautiful. jason: yeah, but first, make sure your valves, gauges, and regulators are clear and working right. okay, everyone ready. remember the safety signals and stay together. let's do it. kimberly: this is a beautiful day for a picnic. so, what's for lunch anyway. fish and chips. is that okay with you. i'll just take the chips. hold the fish. sorry. what is with you and fish anyway, billy. i've just had some rather humiliating experiences. it all started when i was little. while on an outing, i attempted to recreate what i had recently learned about whirlpools but my moving finger proved to be an exciting enticemen to one of the fish below. ouch. ow... the fish actually bit me.  that is hilarious. don't laugh. it's not funny. come on, billy. at least it wasn't a piranha. consequently, it's difficul for me to be near anything fishy. this fish sandwich will not bite you. i don't know. one can never be too careful. say, i wonder how the others are doing. maybe next time we can go diving with them. negative for me. i'm much happier on dry land.  what was that. i don't know. oh, no, it's bulk and skull. i got the big one. all right, bulk. you got a "no fishing" sign. i wonder how they knew you'd be fishing today. some fishermen you guys are. yeah. just check ou all the cool stuff we caught. clam it up, sardinehead. well, at least they're cleaning up the environment. this is it. i knew it. i got one too.  come on.  pipe down, tuna breath. you scared off all the fish. hey, let's surprise the scuba divers. maybe they need some help with their gear. okay. just as long as i don't have to go in. deal. then we can all grab an ice cream afterwards. chocolate chocolate chip. okay. we have got to keep those two off the beach until we're ready. i'll send down a squad of putties. you know, i was about to say you were not. sheesh. shut up, you two. we're going fishing for rangers. i'll get the blanket. i guess i'll pack up the food then. oh, no, we've got company. zack. trini. jason. we need you. there's too many putties. it's hopeless, kimberly. they must be under water. i've got it. billy, you were awesome. thanks, but we should contact zordon. zordon, this is billy. my intuition tells me rita's up to something. your suspicions are correct, billy. come to the command center immediately. ayyiyiyiyi. oh, thank goodness. our sensors have detected a disturbance in the ocean near angel grove beach. oh, no. zordon, zack, jason, and trini are down there scuba diving. i am aware of the situation. rita has unleashed the terrible goofish upon our shores. its harmful venom can immobilize anyone or anything it touches. look at the mess it's making. zordon: there is no time to wait. you two must deal with the goofish before it's too late. it's morphin' time. pterodactyl. triceratops. kimberly: oh, gross, billy. i am the goofish. you are no match for me. why doesn't the goofish finish them. i want those geeks wiped out right now. cast a spell to make billy's fear unbearable. okay.  total terror. bring billy overwhelming terror. make his fear sharp like a spear. with a fishy sigh fill him with fright.

draw out the megazord then use his goo to destroy it. zordon, we had a lot of trouble with that goofish. that was one of rita's worst monsters ever. it's all my fault. i couldn't bring myself to get close to that thing. oh, poor billy. billy, don't blame yourself. everyone has something they're afraid of. isn't there anything we can do to help him, zordon. we'll really need him. billy, rita has cas a spell on you by using your fear of fish. if you face your fear and overcome i her spell will be broken. but i don't think i can face that sea monster. you have no choice, billy. behold the
