okay, i'm ready. da, da, da, dah the junior soccer team tryout results. hey, ernie. how you doing, guys. anything i can get for you. no. we're okay. thanks. hey, ernie, who's that. he looks kind of bummed out. he sure does. oh, that's roger and i know how he feels. i hate choosing teams. gee, ernie, i love soccer but i guess i'm not any good at it. roger, i'm really sorry about all this. i mean, everybody tried so hard. why not give him a second chance. if it was up to me, i'd give everyone a second chance. the kids deserve it. um, ernie, isn't it up to you.  that's right. it is up to me. that's it then. we're going to have a second tryout. yes. all right, ernie. roger: this time i'll make it. if the rangers wan to help that brat play ball we should supply the equipment. yes. bring me a ball that will kick around the rangers. finster: i have just the thing the soccadillo monster ball. rita: will it destroy the power rangers. yes, when fully energized. we'll send it down as soon as it's ready. and then we'll have the thing to clobber those rangers. hey, jace, i hear you and zack got ernie to give roger another try for the junior soccer team. he's giving all the runners up a second chance. so do you think roger will make it this time. after training with the jaceman and me. don't you think someone who knows soccer ought to train the kid. and that would be. . . obviously you have never seen me on the practice field. i don't think anybody has. that's because i don't need practice. allow me to demonstrate. careful, guys. you shouldn't be doing this in the hallway. yeah, okay. zack: see, bulk. somebody could have gotten hurt. kimberly: mrs. applebee, are you all right.  hey, skull. you were supposed to catch it. bulk, skull, detention after school for both of you. thank you, zack. you all right. yeah, i'm fine. i'll see you after first period. tommy: sure. kimberly: okay.  zordon, you called. no, tommy. you contacted me. really. there must be a problem with my communicator. i'll take it to billy as soon as i can. acknowledged. zordon out. rita: finster. tell me about my monster. of course. the longer the soccadillo absorbs energy the more nasty power it gains. when it reaches full charge it will have claws, electric needles even the power rangers will not stop it. today we're going to talk about the theory of the survival of the fittest.  tommy. turn off your pager, please. uh, my pager. oh, yes, my pager. sure, miss applebee.  i'm not going to tell you again, tommy.  tommy. just give that to me. what. we can't have your friends beeping you. but, miss applebee hand it over now. thank you. now, where were we. okay, roger. let's try goaltending. hmm rita: that kid's terrible. i want to send my monster down now. ha. goldar. the monster is not fully charged. i suggest we first send putties to wear the rangers down. all right. we'll have a little game with them. let's try trapping the ball with your foot. not bad. it was pretty good. you ready. i'm just not any good at this. you guys are wasting your time. no, we're not. it takes time to be good at anything. you just have to be patient.  oh, great. clay heads. stay back, rog. what are they waiting for.  rita: i don't care if it's ready or not. send the soccadillo. very well, my queen. begin the attack. jason, do you see what i see. i'm seeing it. i'm just not believing it. do putties play soccer. man, this thing's got a mind of its own. it's coming this way. hiya. so, ernie, are you ready for the tryout. it was a strain choosing between these kids the first time. i don't know how i'll do it again.  what is that. what is what. i'm so concerned over these tryouts i'm hearing things. zordon. jason and zack are under attack by putties at the park. and roger is with them. i've arranged to teleport you there to a spot hidden from view. we're ready, alpha. trini: i'll stay here with roger. we're glad to see you. let's play ball with these amateurs. watch out, kim. whoa. hey. what is it doing. it should have crushed those kids.  man. whoa. you guys were great. what is that thing. behold the soccadillo. billy: amazing. looks like a member of the dasypodidae family. an armored mammal. zordon, this isn't the same creature we saw at the park. rita feeds it energy to change its form and increase its powers. in less than an hour, it may be invincible. i've been trying for some time to contact tommy. any luck. no. nothing. power rangers, without the green ranger you cannot defeat the soccadillo.  tommy: what are you guys doing. sumo thumb wrestling time. okay. fine. have you seen miss applebee. you think miss applebee's going to give you back your pager. miss applebee gives nothing back ever. the soccadillo has reappeared just outside angel grove. we can't reach tommy. we can't wait any longer. with our without tommy it's morphin time. mastodon. pterodactyl. triceratops. sabertoothed tiger. tyrannosaurus. ah. power rangers, at last we meet. but you'll soon find your puny weapons are no match for my armor. let's get them, guys.   tommy. miss applebee.  uh, would you consider returning my, um, pager. please. what's the matter, chowder rangers. tired so soon. the creature's gaining strength rapidly. haha. point for me. opponent caught napping in goal. the game's not over. tower formation. right. right. okay. we're in position. all: now. uhuh. wait. power up. fire. whoa. oh, no. it had no effect on him.  hey, power rangers maybe you'd like to play a little ball. whoa. you're not very good at soccer are you. well, i'll bring some coaches for you. get them, putties. haha. score five for our side. and not only that, we get a free kick. do it, putties.  zordon, come in.  alpha. man, this thing still doesn't work. alpha 5 to tommy. alpha 5 to tommy. come in. alpha, this is tommy here. the rangers need you at the rock quarry. i'm on my way. it's morphin time. dragonzord. whoa.  all right, tommy. i'm just in time to get in this game. let's kick this creep. tommy, power punch.  oh, you power rangers are really getting under my armor now. that does it. i'll fix you rangers just as soon as i stop feeling dizzy. we did it, guys. grow.  now i am invincible. we need dinozord power now.  let's do it. rangers, log on. rock this rodent. i'm ready. play ball. the ball's in our court. let's score one for the good guys. rangers, power up your crystals. two, one. power up. let's do it. we need megazord power now. megazord sequence has been initiated. megazord activated.    i'm going to open you up like a couple of sardine cans. dragonzord, stay on our flank.   when it scrunched up, our shots bounced off. got any ideas. when he unrolls get him with the power sword. we got to hang in there. it can't stay rolled up forever.  and now to finish you. not so close. i call for the power sword now. let's finish it.  all: yes. yes. you messed up another great plan. when will i ever learn. i've seen lunch mea smarter than the four of you. we missed second tryouts. we're just in time to see the results. i hope roger made it. just cross your fingers. all right. yes. all right, guys. congratulations. i made it. i made it. the kids did so well i made up a second team. all right, ernie.  aha. what did i tell everybody. see. you didn't have to work after all. yes, i did. how do you figure. yeah. if i hadn't practiced, i wouldn't be captain of the team. you don't have to practice to be good at something. take skull here, for instance. he's never practiced in his life. give me your ball. skull, show the kid what you got. i'm waiting. i'm waiting, skull.  yeah. captioned by grant brown )
