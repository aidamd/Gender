ahhh. after 10,000 years, i'm free. its time to conquer earth. alpha, rita's escaped. recruit a team of teenagers with attitude. # go, go, power rangers # # go, go, power rangers # # go, go, power rangers # # mighty morphin power rangers # # power rangers # # power rangers # # go, go, power rangers # # you mighty morphin power rangers # kimberly: i can't believe that tommy's the green ranger. there's got to be a mistake. alpha, are you sure. the computer matched his interspacial biovibrations with the green ranger's. the computer's been under repair. maybe it made a mistake. not likely. alpha corrected the malfunction. then tommy is the green ranger. how could tommy do this to us. rita must have cast a spell over tommy, controlling his mind. we can't give up. we have to break rita's spell. and save tommy. goldar: to the destruction of megazord. rita: and total domination of earth. cranberry and oyster juice. and now, the end if near. yep, after today. it was all possible because of our great empress rita. yes. but my brilliant plan continues. are you ready for the fight. yes. it will be an honor to help you conquer earth.  of course. oh, this will be so good. alpha: oh. rita will rule the world. she'll enslave mankind. she'll destroy the command center again. okay, alpha, you've made your point. then you'll reconsider. all right. we have to find tommy and break rita's spell. what if he is at rita's palace. then we wait him out. he'll show up sooner or later. what about zordon, alpha. green ranger thought he got rid of him but there's still a chance that i can bring zordon back. the rest of us will find tommy. look at the size of that guy. what is he doing.  oh, no. hey, ernie. can you believe this is happening. i know. it's terrible. thank goodness for the power rangers. hey. you should be thanking us. yeah, us. yeah. we're the ones that helped the power rangers scare off that big, ugly gold guy. right. yeah, right. we're the ones that should be on tv. yeah. on tv. dream on, bulk. ernie, have you seen tommy. the new kid, right. yes. he's over there. thanks. tommy. tommy, i know. i know you're the green ranger. well, then, pink ranger, you should also know that you and the other power rangers will soon be destroyed. let us help you. we can break rita's spell. rita is my empress. she will soon rule the world. tommy, please let us help you. you have been warned. but, goldar we haven't seen this zord in 10,000 years. quiet. silence, you fools. if she chooses to call forth the dragonzord then it will be called forth. whaa. rita: behold, the mighty dragonzord. now my green ranger shall have a zord which he can use to crush those power rangers. at last, their destruction will be complete.  dragonzord. all this will belong to empress rita once i and my zord put down the power rangers forever.  ay yi yi yi yi. i've got to find a way to get zordon back. if i can just manage to gain access to his dimentional files. let's see. numerical sequence is correct. sector 10q9 hmm. search initiated. access granted. i've done it. i'm in. computer, begin search of sector 10q9 sweeping all perimeters. well, zordon, now it's only a matter of time. so you found tommy. yeah. and his eyes were glowing green. it was really scary. wow. man. he has known all along who we are. that we're the power rangers. mmhmm. and he is definately out to get us. he's got to be under one of rita's spells. that would explain why he's acting so weird. and the putties didn't attack him. finally, this is all starting to make sense. trini, what's wrong. there's trouble downtown. it's all over the radio. a monster's attacking the business district. rita's not giving up, is she. it's morphin time. mastodon. pterodactyl. triceratops. sabretooth tiger. tyrannosaurus. let's do it. zack: over there. tommy: well, well. a total surprise. he's on top of the building. tommy. dragonzord, destroy the power rangers.  trini: what is he doing. zack: he's calling to the dragonzord with his flute.  he's going to fire. you don't know what you're doing. i'm destroying you and i'm doing it because my empress commands me to. soon, she'll rule the world. what's this. tommy, no. why doesn't he stop fooling around and finish them. don't do this, man. but i must. there is no other choice.  look out for his tail. we can't stop him. yeah, it's working. man, i can't believe this is happening. with any luck alpha five, welldone. you have reestablished our computer linkup. zordon, it's you. you're back. yes, alpha. get them to their zords. their zords have been taken away. the green ranger is on the rampage. by destroying his sword of darkness they will break rita's spell. my power morpher, it's glowing. mine too. yeah. zordon's back. log on. mastodon, rearing to go. triceratops, battle ready. pterodactyl's looking good. sabretooth tiger, online. oh, i don't believe it. all right.  tommy, you don't know what you're doing. all right, rangers, power up. two, one power up. let's do it. switching to megazord battle mode. megazord sequence has been initiated. megazord activated. let's do it. increase power. we've got to save tommy. right. right. morphin. morphin. give it up, tommy. no way. sorry, but zordon says i've got to destroy your sword to save you before you and rita destroy the world. all right, i'm going down.  huh. oh, man. now, red ranger, it is time for me to destroy you. i must be victorious for my queen. i think he's finally going to do it. it's all over, tommy. all right, guys, let's morph. right. you destroyed the power sword. rita's spell is broken. you okay, tommy. what's happening to me. you'll no longer under rita's power. my head's spinning. come on. you're be okay, man. what have i done. what you did, was under rita's influence. you own the power now. fight by our side, and we can defeat rita. after everything that's happened. tommy, we need you. it's where you belong. will you join us, tommy. oh, look, zordon. you're watching history in the making, alpha. finally, the prophesy has been fulfilled. the sixth ranger is now one of us. hooray. all right, then. it's morphin time. dragonzord. mastodon. pterodactyl. triceratops. sabretooth tiger. tyrannosaurus. yeah. we're ready to morph into action. six working together to fight evil and stop rita and all her menacing monsters from destroying our planet earth and ruling the universe with evil. look out, rita. we're not backing down because we're the power rangers. zordon: with our new friend comes new power. use your flute, tommy, and bring life to the dragonzord. when he combines with the mastodon, tricratops and sabretoothed tiger a new fighting machine will be at our disposal.  all right. man, it's awesome. look, they're coming together. # go, go, power rangers # # go, go, power rangers # # go, go, power rangers # # mighty morphin power rangers # # go, go, power rangers # zordon: rangers, i give you dragonzord in fighting mode. # go, go, power rangers # check it out. it's morphinomenal. the safely of the universe is once again in your hands, power rangers. no. i can't believe those pinheads beat us. i will avenge you, my queen. i promise you zordon and his power rangers will be made to pay. we missed you, zordon. morale was pretty low without you. the fact remains that as you faced your greatest danger with the odds stacked against you you acted like true super heroes and persevered. we owe a lot to alpha. alpha you displayed exemplary leadership capabilities in my absence. i am very proud of you. oh, well, i ah, shucks. now i welcome our newest ranger. now that you are a true power ranger, tommy you must follow three basic rules or lose the power. first, never use your power for personal gain. second, never escalate a battle unless rita forces you and finally keep your identity secret. no one may know you are a power ranger. you can count on me, zordon, 100%. here. i made you a communicator. thanks, man. you're one of us now. welcome aboard. a new chapter has begun, rangers. let the power protect you. power rangers. captioned by grant brown )
