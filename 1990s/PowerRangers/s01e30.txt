those rangers are history. we have to find it first. we'll start today. it's hidden on earth.  # bumbumbumbumbum # you see, skull the beauty of the sloppy joe pizza is that you can make a huge funnel

famous. jason: hey, bulk. nice shirt. does that come with extra cheese. you know i don't like your attitude. come on. i think it's time for me to teach you a little lesson.  jase, watch out for that. gee, bulk. that look is you. that was awesome how you tricked him into beating himself. just remember that it's brains before brawn. right, brains before brawn. you're getting better. the cool thing about martial arts is it teaches you selfdiscipline and confidence. hey, jase, teach me a cool move. okay. back leg, front kick. good. all right. all right. now, this one's a little harder but i want you to try it. okay. all right. now, try it again, but focus. hey, i did it. when i was your age, i was really insecure but martial arts built my selfconfidence. wow. now you're the coolest. all you have to do is practice. i hope i can be as cool as the power rangers. power rangers. yeah. that's what i want to be when i grow up. all right. rita: what's jason doing there. squatt: martial arts.

behind me. watch your back. stay back. good job, jeremy. wow. i'd always heard about rita and the putties but i never thought i'd actually see them. let's hope you don't see them again. hey, hey, i

totally cool. what a way to start a vacation. and check out this map. rita: it leads to the mirror of destruction.  and once i've got my hands on it you'll suffer the same fate as all the others. it will zap them so hard, they won't know what hit them. we need that map. right. go and get it, scorpina. yeah.  scorpina: over there. scorpina: the rockstar will take care of him in no time. get the map from the kid. jeremy, run. but i'll find you later. don't let anything happen to that map. gotcha. jason, now you'll get what's coming to you. attack. now, rockstar.  you won't get away with this, scorpina. that rockstar is one tough monster. jason doesn't stand a chance pinned down like that. he's a sitting duck. what will we do. alpha, we must contact the other power rangers. they are the only ones who can save him.  zordon, i read you. teleport to the beach immediately. we're on our way. here. jason. don't worry, jason. we'll free you. are you all right.  thanks. that was a close one.

been them. oh, you've met the power rangers. sure did. there was also the scorpion lady called the rockstar. idiosyncratic. he spit out these rocks as big as a house. really. really. yeah, and he hit the yellow one. the black one kicked him into the pool. and then later the pink one flew through the air with her bow and arrow. she was just awesome. tell us more about the black one. and the scorpion lady turned into this huge monster and the power rangers jumped into this huge robot. wow. wow. sounds like you had a pretty wild time. i got to go. you should have seen the red one battle it out with the scorpion lady. he was the greatest. yeah. continue. he did the coolest flying spin kick.  hey, jase i meant to ask you. where were you all that time. i have a martial arts class that i need to teach. come on, jeremy. captioned by grant brown )
