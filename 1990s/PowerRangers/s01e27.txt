happens to be very important to me. i've got a spinning wheel to send you, and when it hits you pathetic power rangers will all be smashed flat. what's with the long face. this is not like you. i just feel bad about my grandmother's antique spinning wheel. what happened. i don't know, it's stuck or something. oh, ernie, not only is this ruin the play but i'll never be able to face my grandmother. that's a tough break. what's wrong, kim. she's worried about her grandmother's spinning wheel. it's always been very special to her. what am i going to do if it's really broken. don't be bummed out. i bet i can fix it. you think you could. let's take a look at it. oh, thank you, tommy. bye, ernie. the first thing we do is steal her spinning wheel. at once, your highness. their own wheel shall become the wheel of misfortune and destroy them. yes.  there it is. get it. let's go. thank you so much, tommy, for doing this. i really appreciate it. hey, no problem. thanks. where's the spinning wheel. i don't know. maybe somebody moved it. it has to be here somewhere. i don't see it anywhere. let's ask some of the kids if they know anything. we're never going to find it. did you see anyone move the spinning wheel. have you seen the spinning wheel from play. have you seen the wheel. have you seen it. uhuh. did you see it.   hey, have you seen the spinning wheel. it's not in the classroom. oh, yeah. i was broke, so skull here decided to spin me some money so i could buy a soda.  hey. i'm not kidding around, bulk. i mean it. did you see it. no, i didn't see it, you goodygood. what would i want with a stupid spinning wheel, anyway. okay. now i will summon the dread wheel of misfortune. arise and destroy. what's the matter. you look quite distressed, kim. you won't believe this. someone walked off with my grandmother's prized antique spinning wheel. that's awful. i know. green ranger is on his way to angel grove park. i've sent the putty patrol to take care of him.  what are you clay brains doing here. i don't have time for this. man, why did i put my communicator in my bag.. that's one power ranger down. five more to go.  warp to the command center. we have a desperate situation, power rangers. we're on our way. the mysterious disappearance of your grandmother's spinning wheel has been solved. goldar has stolen it. why. so that rita could put an evil spell on it. now it can destroy everything it touches including you. i can't believe this. behold the viewing globe. rita's plan is to keep tommy out of the way. by outsmarting her you can break the spell and destroy her evil wheel. oh, poor tommy. we'd better help him. zordon: you have something more urgent to do goldar and scorpina are on the rampage. you must deal with them. looks like it's morphin time. mastodon. pterodactyl. triceratops. sabretooth tiger. tyrannosaurus. see the power i have over you. watch now what happens, and see how high they grow.  attack. we need dinozord power. now. let's go. all right, rangers, let's take these monsters out. throw the net.  jason's in trouble. time to finish you, red ranger, for good. hang on, jason. rangers, get away from here. you've got to save yourselves before it's too late. ay yi yi. the power rangers need help, zordon. tommy's just got to get free. have patience, alpha 5. tommy knows what he has to do.   hey, putties. help me. i'm starting to feel sick. really sick.  you clay brains are unbelievable. zordon, what's going on. a battle rages on the other side of the park. i told jason to bring all the zords together to form ultrazord. if this fails, the world is doomed. i'm on my way. dragonzord. let's get them. aw, man. rangers, power up your crystals. two, one power up. let's show them some megazord power. let's switch to megazord battle mode. megazord sequence has been initiated. megazord activated. we're going to need the power sword. perfect. it's working. chop them down. what. attack. yeah. look out. we're not finished yet. i call on titanus and the power of the ultrazord. ultrazord, power up. look out. lock on and fire weapons. aw, nuts. fools, you've destroyed our wheel. those power geeks think they've beaten me but i'll be back and they'll be sorry. that was so cool. we really socked it to rita. i'll tell you what, her evil wheel of misfortune is gone forever. but, you guys what about my grandmother's spinning wheel. what am i going to tell her. no way. it's back. and it works. but how did it get here. this is most mysterious.  it is no mystery, power rangers. when you defeated rita's henchmen her magic spell was broken. therefore, kimberly, your spinning wheel was returned to it's original location. yeah. all right.    announcer: this just in. we've just gotten word that once again the amazing power rangers have saved our fair city and the world from one of rita repulsa's monsters. just when it was getting good. yeah. that was my favourite part. what are you guys doing. the curtain is up. come on. break a leg, kim. don't you dare. and you'd better spin all of this straw into gold or else. yeah. or else. now there are three piles of straw to spin into gold. oh, woe is me. where's rumplestiltskin. oh, where's rumplestiltskin. rumplestiltskin, did you hear me. hurry up. get out there. take a chill pill, will you.  never fear, fair babe. i said i'd be here and here i am. took you long enough. give us a smooch, fair babe. yes, of course. but first you have to spin all the straw into gold. get ready to pucker up, fair dame. that's it, bulk. way to bare your soul for your audience. let's get out of here. the end. captioned by grant brown )
