done, my empress. zordon has been eliminated. and the power rangers are next.  so long, zordon. my work here is done. yes. and now for an even bigger surprise.  with zordon out of the way, it's just a matter of time before rita controls the whole world. ready, empress. magic wand, make my goldar grow.  oh, boy. you watch. he'll crush them all. and now for an end to those power rangers. i don't think i've ever seen the rad bug this clean. yeah, well, it's going to be stylin' after zack's wax. zack's wax. hey. hey, ladies, just in time. just grab a rag and join in. i'm not in the mood. what's

back. keep trying. we need answers now. a guy in a green costume attacked our zords. he just busted right in. do you have any idea who is was. i'm sorry, rangers, i don't. trini: alpha. he's still not competely recovered from the computer virus. quasitronic circuitry now in overload, overload. temporary shutdown. this is bad news. man. first, zordon disappears and then this green guy shows. and i think we only got a small sample of his true power. this is all too weird. what are we going do. prepare ourselves. we don't have zordon to help us this time. we'll have to do it on our own. i think we've only made it through round one of what's about to be a major battle. hey, look.  to fall of the power rangers. i'll destroy you, one and all.  captioned by grant brown )
