ahhh. after 10,000 years, i'm free. its time to conquer earth. alpha, rita's escaped. recruit a team of teenagers with attitude. # go, go, power rangers # # go, go, power rangers # # go, go, power rangers # # mighty morphin power rangers # # power rangers # # power rangers # # go, go, power rangers # # you mighty morphin power rangers # goldar's blowing the world to bits. we got to move. it's morphin time. what's going on. we're not morphin. something is seriously wrong. alpha, what is it. i'm getting a reading. ayyiyiyiyi. it's an interdimensional power surge caused by the beam trying to locate zordon. it's shutting down all sources of energy within the command center and throughout the morphin grid. we can't morph. not until the power surge ends. but goldar's ripping the city apart. there's nothing i can do. oh, and now we've lost the computer too. if we can't morph goldar's going to trash the world. so we have giant goldar smashing things to lure the power rangers into the open, and then it's lights out for megazord. rita: i'll cast a spell to eclipse the sun and cut off the source of megazord's power. instead of one of my monsters finishing off those teenagers i suppose you'll use the green ranger. yes. # finster's in trouble. # i'm ready for battle now. i am ready to destroy the power rangers.  i don't believe we're stuck here. man, seems like things just keep going from bad to worse. i wish there was something i could do. hold on. i've got an idea. let me try something. if i connect this negative electrode to this ayyiyiyiyiyiyi. alpha, billy's trying to concentrate. you can do it, billy. i know it. come on, billy. let's see if i connect this positive electrode to this positive electrode hey, it worked. you fixed it. we should to able to morph now. alpha, keep looking for zordon while we take care of goldar. guys, it's morphin time. mastodon. pterodactyl. triceratops. sabretoothed tiger. tyrannosaurus. power rangers. ready. all right, power geeks i'm tired of fooling around. now, feel my sting. jason, we've got to use a new tactic. ayyiyiyiyi. the rangers need your help, zordon. they need your guidance. where are you. alpha. can you read me. yes, zordon. i am sector q9 reading me. q9, i'm on it, zordon. off beam. calm down, everyone. let's get out of the building before it collapses. sit down. bit, bulk, the building's about to fall down. i'm not finished with my ice cream yet. now i'm finished. what are you doing, bulk. that gold guy's heading this way. the youth center bus is the fastest way out of here. right, out of here. goldar, stop playing and get those rangers.  we're getting closer, zordon. the computer is still decoding your coordinates. you must hurry, alpha. ayyiyiyiyi. now, where was i. alpha, look out behind you, alpha. no, you can't.  you stupid, power geeks, ready to give up. never. jason, you are a fool. you're the fool if you think we'll ever surrender to you. silence. you guys all right. you can't win, rita. it's time now to complete my evil plan. no, rita. goldar, do it. watch where you're going. who taught you how to drive. nobody. how am i doing. you drive like a maniac. thank you. that was not a compliment, you dimwit. say, bulk, where are we going. as far away as possible. that monster's on our tail. oh, right.  something's got our tail. what's going on. bulk: help. no, they're civilians. yes, i know. actually, they're friends of yours. i believe you call them bulk and skull. goldar, put them down. not until you surrender. how come buses don't have seat belts. take them to the beach. got to save them. i'm going to make sure you're history this time. alpha, what is happening. i'm what happening, old man. the green ranger. rita's prize warrior. green ranger, you will not win following her dark path. you are wrong. she will win and evil will rule. evil will never rule. oh, it will, zordon, when i defeat the power rangers. that is impossible. enough. it's time to send you to another dimension and this time you'll be lost forever. green ranger, tommy, don't move.  well, rangers, what took you so long. jason: there she is. with scorpina. wait a minute, where's the bus. i'll help you. it's over there. what are we going to do. let's get out of here. great idea. this is serious. it's going over any second. we've got to do something. we're going over the edge. we're going to be history. you mean like famous. no, i mean like dust.  stop screaming. stop moving. stop breathing. we're going over. yeah. we're going over. look. they're almost over the edge. oh, no. we've got to get up there. we make a move they'll send it over for sure.  oh, i want my mommy. yeah. i want your mommy. they're going over anyway. let's go. whoa, man. not goldar again.  don't forget the bus. zordon: you'll never get away with this. but i already have. i just need to finish the job.  the power rangers will stop you. i don't think so. your little superhero group can't help you now. maybe not. what. but i can. computeractiviate force field around intruder. no. this is impossible. i thought i turned you off. you didbut my backup system kicked in. you're going to pay for this, robot. alpha, the grid is failing. i am losing contact. i'll get you back. it's no use, robot.  zordon's gone forever.  hold on, skull. i am holding on. i know. you're choking me. all: we need dinozord power, now. the zords are here. rita: all right, do it.  alright. hold on. let's get this party started. systems, ready for action. ready to rock. all right, let's do it. activate power crystal. all: power crystal activated. power up. two. one. power up. move out. let's show some megazord power. the megazord sequence has been initiated. megazord activated. are we alive. i don't know. i'll find out. ouch.. feel that. oh, we're alive. we're alive. we're alive. we're alive. billy: solar power diminishing. hurry up, scorpina. now. let's see her grow. try me. watch out for her stinger. zack: solar power is down 25%. we're losing power. we're down to 50%. a black sun is a thing of such beauty, isn't it. now you'll be powerless to stop me. solar power cells are almost out. the power swordhurry. we can use it to charge up the power cell.  try all you want, robotit will do you no good. zordon, i'm losing you. zordon is lost and soon the power rangers will be lost too. ay yi yi yi yi. we need the power sword, now. now we have a chance. zordon, zordon, please come in. aw, what's the matter, you little mechanical misfit. can't you make anything work. let me out and i'll do the same for you. you are truly evil, green ranger. it's time to find out who's behind that mask. excellent. time to call on green ranger. use your spells to release him. better luck next time, tin head.  wait. how did you. what. i oh. ay yi yi yi yi. now, green ranger, grow.  it's green ranger. you pathetic power rangers are finally going down. we don't have enough power left to finish this fight. at full power, we'd crush him. we got to hang in. give me all the power left.    the plan is working just like i knew it was going to.  what happened to megazord. over there. our zords. they're totaled. i can't believe it. it's like rita destroyed a part of us. they were always there for us. now they're gone. just when we need them most. power rangers are history. it's over. rita's won. rangerswe can't give up. why shouldn't we. zordon's gone. the megazord have been destroyed. we're outmatched. billy, what are the chances of bringing zordon back online. less then 10%. isn't the smallest chance of victory enough of a reason for us to keep on fighting. the world needs us, rangers. let's face itthe green ranger was rita's trump card. she played it. she won. no, rangers. i cannot accept that. zordon would not accept that. but zordon's not here.  what's going on. the computer finally has an answer. when the green ranger was caught in the force field the computer locked onto his biovibrations. it's been trying to make a match. you mean it knows his identity. exactly. to show us who he is on the viewing globe. finally, some answers.  it's coming together. aw, man. no way. kimberly, look. i don't believe it. tommy. captioned by grant brown )
