of those poogles.  poogles. poogles.  i knew it was a poogle all along.  i meant to buy a poogle.   everyone has one but me and i don't know i just feel really left out.  that's how fads work.  everyone just has to have it now but soon no one will even care.  but it's not soon now.  it's now now and everybody cares... a lot.  i wish i could help.  i remember when your father...  wait a

messed him up bad.  hey, arthur.  cool rock.   buster: ...and after school you'll get to visit muffy and all her woogle pals.  we can sit by the pool.  won't that be fun.  oh, hi, buster.  i'm going to talk to arthur for a sec okay, bilbo.  bilbo says hi.  i was wondering, do you think it's possible that woogles aren't good for you.  what do you mean.  well, you spend all your time with it.  we haven't played hockey in days.  it's just woogle, woogle, woogle day and night like you can't help yourself.  i can help myself.  i don't need it.  i could get rid of it at any time and not ca are you sure.   let go.  it's mine.  : you put it in the trash.  it doesn't count.  you tricked me.  whoa.  poor bilbo.  can i just see it for two seconds.  i've never even held one.  all right.  just two

one of those dopey toys.  yeah, those things are so dorky, you couldn't pay me to have one.  hey, binky.  i finally got another chartreuse woogle.  enjoy.   : it burps.  check it out.   arthur : have no fear, bionic bunny is here.  keeping the world safe from... from...  there's nobody left to play bad guy.  arthur, you're sitting all by yourself.  i have an extra archie.  take it and come play with us.  gee, thanks.  but first, you have to admit you were wrong and that you always wanted one.  what..  just say it.  say, "i always loved woogles," and it's yours.  okay, i've always loved...  no, i can't say that... but, okay, okay...  no. i still think they're dweeby.  i don't even know why i want one.  i bet...  i bet even this is more fun than a woogle.   like anybody could think that old cap is more fun than a lovable woogle.   hey, cool.  kids: wow, where'd you get that. i want one.  here, arthur.  this is for doing so well on your report card.  gee, grandma, thanks, but...  you were right about these just being a fad.  now it's juice caps.  they're really fun.   kids: and now a word from us kids.  hi, i'm kathy.  this is my class.  we designed and made our own toys and games.  both: pompom bugs.  this is a spider.  and its name is spot.  because it has a big spot on its back.  this is their home and it's like sort of like an apartment house.  both: tim the tennis ball head.  boy: my name is tim the tennis ball head.  i cut open his mouth so he can talk.  your head is nothing but hollow, dadadada.  we invented pencil people.  we made them with clay.  elastic ball.  it bounces.  we made it wh rubber bands.  you can definitely bounce it.  both: tennis ball animals.  this one can spin.  this one can bounce.  both: space station claw with pipe cleaner people.  boy: this is basically a space station made from paper plates.  these are two people from the space station.  the xl thruster '98.  the interstar.  this is a game called "flying saucer knockout" and we try to knock the cans down with our flying saucers that we made out of paper plates.  boys: here are different ways to set up the cans.  kids: and now, back to arthur.  oh, hello, are you looking for arthur.  arthur.  he must be doing his homework.  i'm working on my latest creation.  it's bold, risky.  no other chef has dared to combine what i have combinedcinnamon toast souffle.  the only problem is getting them out of the toaster.   hmm, like all great inventorsgalileo, the wright brothersi'm used to setbacks.  i'm also used to my experiments being misunderstood.  for dessert... chunky pudding balls.  ugh. ugh.  anyone for cranberry prune crumble.  i don't like broken food.  shouldn't you encourage us to snack on vegetables.  oh, it's delicious.  ugh. ugh.  oh, well, if da vinci could deal with it, so can i.  oh, arthur, just in time.  i need someone to taste this.  arthur.   ratburn: and so in 1609 galileo built the first astronomical telescope.  tomorrow is the birthday of this great italian scientist.  we'll celebrate by studying his theory of the solar system.  if it's his birthday, we should have a birthday party.  that would help us learn better.  and every birthday party needs cake and ice cream.  cake.  to celebrate someone's birthday and not have cake seems... disrespectful.  we can't disrespect galileo.  all right, a birthday party it is.  brain: my mom can make ice cream.  my mom can make cookies.  excellentmy treat to you is i'm cutting five questions off your quiz about galileo.  i wish he was giving us peanut brittle instead.  arthur: we're having a class party tomorrow.  i said you'd bake cookies.  oh, honey, i have three deadlines i'm trying to meet.  did someone mention baking.  no.  i'll bake something.  you're not going to make anything... weird, are you.  when have i ever made anything weird.   got to check my turnip muffins.   don't worry, arthur.  your dad will come up with something very unique.  that's what i'm afraid of.  and here it is.  wwhat is it.  honey cake in the shape of the leaning tower of pisa.  galileo, italyget it.  but i said i'd bringcookies, not a whole tower of pizza.  arthur.  it's nice, dad, thanks.  what is it.  it seems to be glorifying poor architecture.  finallysomething i don't want to eat.  i give this cake and its owner a "d." "d" for disgusting.   your mom's ice cream is great, brain.  yeahweren't you bringing something, arthur.   oh, my.   i've never seen anything like this.  francine : what is it.  ratburn: "d" for disgusting.  this is delicious.  huh.  mmm. who brought this cake.  i did.  my dad made it.  buster: i want some.  is there a party.  try the cake arthur's father made.  oh, yummy. i'd love a cake like this to serve my class after our singalong.  my dad can make it, no problem.  oh, arthur, you're a sweetheart.  everyone loved it.  i brought the most popular dessert.  that's great, arthur.  i told miss sweetwater you'd make one for her class singalong.  that's wonderful... what.  why didn't i get cake.  i'm in school, too.  giving some students cake and not others is against the law.  if you want a cake for your school, d.w.  i'll make you one.  i'm a hit.  kids: ooh. wow.  this beautiful cake was brought to us by arthur read in mr. ratburn's class.  kids: thank you.  i have an important note to deliver.  be right back.  arthur, what are you doing.  er...  i thought you might want to see the spring reading list...  oh, are you having cake.  please, join us.  mmm.   everyone wants my cake.  hey, what else do we do around here that needs cake.  arthur: dad, you can make dessert for our band recital tomorrow, can't you.  another dessert.  performing is hard. we need the kind of energy you can only get from sugar.  i have tons of orders to fill today.  pleaseeveryone wants your desserts.  you're more popular than bionic bunny.  really.  well, then...  there are 20 of us in the band.  that's probably one cake.  and maybe two more for the audience.  thanks, dad.  audience..  he's getting a bit carried away.  i suppose... it's just that a couple of days ago, i couldn't even get him )
