 all i ever do.  and i never get anything in return.  like the other day...  3:30 is my tv time, the time i get to watch mary moo cow.  but since i was feeling so nice, i decided to let arthur watch dark bunny,his favorite show.  arthur: that's not sharing.  you lost your tv time because you talked back to dad.  you had to let me watch.  he's not sharing. she's lying.  thank you for sharing.  care to share.  my favorite thing is sharing with my best friend, marina.  we met because i shared my henry skreever special edition book with her, and now we share practically everything.  that's beautiful.  simply beautiful.  now, is there anything you won't share.  nothing.  nothing.  well...  maybe one thing.  what. please share.  i can't .  you must.  and i predict that you will shortly see...     pruney, stop.  i'm so glad you've been waking up to do yoga with me.  are you kidding.  rubella's missing out.  this is better than sleeping an extra hour.  plus, the yoga really helps me with my soupitch matches.  i've been getting the bouillon cube twice as often as marina.  no idea what that means, but i'll take your word for it.  prunella: take that, worthy opponent.  don't even think about it.  this time, the cube is mine.  marina.  that's amazing.  you're inhanumanasana.  "hanumanu"what.  hanumanasanait's a yoga pose.  you're doing it almost perfectly.  i am.  you should do yoga with my mom and me.  you're a natural.  i don't know.  i've never done yoga before.  i don't want to embarrass myself.  you can't be bad at yoga.  but can it protect you from the dreaded claw of lord moldywort.   marina: is there room for one more on that grass.  marina.  i didn't think you'd come.  it's okay if she joins us, isn't it, mom.  of course.  i'll just go get another mat.  you promise you won't laugh if i mess up.  relax, marina.  it's just my mom and me.  now bring your left foot forward between your hands and then reach to the sky.  mom, look at marina's warrior one pose.  can you believe this is her first time.  prunella was rightyou really are a natural.  now bring your back foot forward alongside your front foot, bend at the waist, bringing your hands back down to the mat.  marina: i love yoga.  i was practicing right up until bedtime last night.  and your mom is such a good teacher.  yep, she's the best.  i mean, my mom and i do things together, like quilting, but it's not the same as doing yoga.  you're so lucky.  your mom's giving a yoga class.  can i join.  no.  oh, please.  all the stars are doing yoga.  my mom's not giving a class, muffy.  it's just something we do for fun.  come on, marina.  but i've found the perfect outfit for it.  see.  it's retro chic.   muffy doing yoganow, there's a funny thought.  yeah.  but if anybody could teach her, it would be your mom.  upward dog, into downward dog again.   well, marina, i think you've gotten the hang of the sun salutation.  you're starting to improve a little.  now, let's meditate a little in the halflotus position.  sit down and put one foot on top of the opposite thigh.   mom.  mom, looki'm in a full lotus.  that's great, pruney.  do you want to try full lotus, marina.  just bring your other foot up on top of your other thigh.  like this.  exactly.  nicely done.   prunella, what are you doing.  be careful.  just... trying something new.  come out of that pose right away.  you could injure yourself.  what's she doing.  she's got a foot behind her head and...  ow. ow.  i think i'm stuck.  get me out.  i'm trying, prunella.  can i help.  no.  prunella's mom: pruney.  time to wake up.  yoga is calling.  yogashmoga.  i'm too tired.  are you sure.    steady, steady.  don't let the tower topple.   kids : guru wanda, guru wanda, we love, we love guru wanda.  guru wanda, we love, we love guru wanda.  thank you.  wanda loves you, too.  be seated.  i have a very important announcement.  i have chosen my successor, the person who will lead you all through yoga to enlightenment: my daughter.   i'm here.  i won't disappoint...  prunella's mom: not you, honey.  i was talking about my spiritual daughter, marina.  kids : guru marina, guru marina, we love, we love guru marina.  prunella's mom: sorry, pruney, but marina is better at yoga than you.  and you're not wearing yellow.  kids : guru marina, guru marina.  mice : guru marina, we love, we love guru marina.    marina's mom: hi, prunella.  marina's not here.  isn't she at your house doing yoga.  uhhuh.  i took a break today.  mrs. datillo, do you know anything about quilting.  i could really use some help.  prunella: you're so good at this.  ow.  i wish my mom would do quilting with me, butow.she's all thumbs.  would you like another thimble, prunella.  yes, please.  and my needle came unthreaded again.  prunella, there you are.  why weren't you at yoga this morning.  i just didn't feel like it.  marina, you are so lucky.  your mom is such a good quilting teacher.  oh, i'm not so sure about that.  marina: not bad, prunella, but try making the stitches a little smaller.  keep your other hand on the seam to help guide you.  needle, mom.  see.  hey, this is a really nice quilt.  it's so soft.  yeah.  my mom gave it to me.  i have to go.  marina: what about your quilt.  you can hang on to it.  she'll probably give it to you anyway.  hey, i was just about to make a call.  sorry, i touched it first.  i'll just be a minute.  privacy, please.  prunella : hello, mrs. datillo.  no, you don't have to get marina, but could i leave a message.  could you tell her that my mom can't do yoga anymore.  yeah, she, um... pulled a muscle.  thanks.   prunella: mom, why aren't you dressed yet.  i don't feel like doing yoga today.  granola.  no.  i really wanted to do yoga.  you're good enough to do it on your own.  you don't need me.  yes, i do.  that's the whole reason i...  rubella: told mrs. datillo mom had pulled a muscle.  ha.  busted.  you were eavesdropping.  so.  that's not as bad as lying.  okay, you two, that's enough.   i'm going back to bed.  my work here is done.  i'm sorry.  i don't know why i lied.  i guess i just wanted things to be like they were before marina joined us.  but she's your best friend.  i thought you wanted her to join us.  yeah, but i didn't want her to steal my mom.  pruney, as much as i like marina, she's not my daughter.  i will never love her as much as i love you.  so, can't we do some yoga now.  just you and me.  i have something a little different in mind.  okay, everybody, welcome.  i'm so glad you're all here to try yoga with us.  i think you all know my assistant teacher.  and if you want to see a pose demonstrated perfectly, watch marina.  excuse me.  how long will it take us before we have abs of steel.  one step at a time, muffy.  we'll start with simple poses, like downward dog.  bring your hands down to the mat, and bring your front foot back alongside your back foot.  woof, woof, woof, woof, woof, woof.  pruney, your special student needs assistance.  breathe, d.w.  don't bark, breathe.   kids: and now...  i'm maya, and this is my sister, rosie.  this is my mom, carol.  i'm carol, and we're at artbeat.  maya: and basically, it's an art store where you pick different art projects that you want to do.  it's something we do together a lot.  i think it's fun to have my mom like to do art projects with me.  carol: we appreciate what each other's doing and get excited about it.  rosie: i just finished my mosaic frog.  looks great, rosie.  i start with a wick, right.  fold it up.  okay.  maya: it's important for parents and kids to do stuff together so they can hang out together.  my name is esm, this is rumney rock, and i'm going to climb it with my mom.  on belay.  climbing. climb away.  we're going to help each other.  first my mom's going to belay me.  when you belay someone, it means when you hold the rope.  mom: esm is a really a good communicator.  i can feel that you're holding me tight.  mom: so we have a really good climbing relationship.  esme: my mom belayed me.  now we'll do the same thing except for the opposite.  mom: esm wants to belay me.  we'll see if she's heavy enough to keep me safe.  she might go flying up in the air when i come down.  i'm responsible for my mom now.  i totally trust esm.  mom, do you need more slack.  no, thanksslack makes me kind of nervous.  mom: we enjoy sharing the responsibility and even the risk and the challenge.  i just belayed my mom.  and now...  mr. ratburn: we interrupt this episode to bring you a news bulletin.  i'm here in downtownelwood city, where widespread panichas caused a mass exodus.  muffy:he's angry.  run for your lives.  excuse me, miss.  can you tell mewho or what you are running from.  you don't wantto know.  sir.  can you describethis... this creature.  he's horrible.  he spits fire and he hasthese big sharp claws and...  the fangs.  don't forgetthe fangs.  then you'veactually seen him.  uh, no.  somebody told us about him.  but it's gotto be true, right.  and i sure don want finout for my...   oh, no. he's coming.  run....  hey, where did everybody go.  i just wanted to play checkers.  .  yay.   okay, everybody, very exciting news today.  a new interscholastic sports league has just been formed, and they've asked us to compete, which means one of you lucky, lucky students will get the privilege of representing our school in what i personally consider the most thrilling sport ever devised by mankind...  checkers.  i know, it seems too good to be true, doesn't it.  i, too, was speechless when i heard the news.  any volunteers.  hey, you like checkers.  why don't you volunteer.  i don't know if i'm good enough.  i'm kind of... average.  what do you mean.  you always beat me.  come on, raise your hand.  class: come on, brain.  what.  mr. ratburn: well, alan, it looks like you're the favorite.  do you want to volunteer.  class : brain. brain. brain. brain.  do i have to.  i mean, checkers is kind of boring.  it's not really challenging like, say, chess.  okay, okay, i'll do it.  francine: brain is so conceited.  "boring," he says, "not challenging." who does he think he is.  but everybody thought it was boring.  nobody raised their hand.  except you.  it's different with us.  we're not conceited.  francine's right.  somebody should go up against hi just to prove he's not as special as he thinks.  binky: can you believe brain today.  i know.  arthur's going to challenge him.  huh.  didn't buster say you raised your hand.  you're not scared, are you.  no, i'm not scared.  ii've beaten brain at checkers before.   binky: brain is going to get it.  do it, arthur.  you can prove there's something average kids can win at.  kids : arthur. arthur. arthur.  arthur: and then they started chanting my name.   what's so funny.  you beat brain in something.  i'd like to see that.  well, i think it's great, honey.  just keep it in perspective.  oh, sure.  crowd : arthur. arthur. arthur.  arthur.  buster: arthur. arthur.   are you okay.  you should get off the bike before parking it.   i was just, uh, thinking about my checkers strategy.  oh, of course.  i'm really glad you decided to enter.  i have a feeling you're going to place a really strong second.  it's only me versus brain, buster.  i know.  francine: pep rally before the first checkers playoff match.  come support arthur read before the big game.  wow, a pep rally.  i've never had one of those before.  what do you think it'll be like.  this is weird.  do we want some conceited knowitall representing us in checkers.  all: no.  who do we want.  all: arthur.  why do we want him.  all: he's average.  do we have to call brain names.  " gns.  hi, arthur, i'm muffy crosswire withthe muffy report.  any words for our internet audience.  internet audience.  i'm starting a web site for the benefit of all the average kids who can't be here to see mr. conceited finally get what's coming to him.  "mr. conceited".  can we just call him brain.  kids : "a" is for "arthur".  "a" is for "average".  "a" is for "arthur".  "a" is for "average".  muffy: i'm here at the first playoff match to determine lakewood's representative in the interscholastic checker olympics.  and with me is francine frensky, a completely objective average kid picked at random from the audience.  francine, what is your perspective on this game.  francine: brain thinks he's so smart.  let's see how bored he is when he loses.  muffy: so true.  oh. it looks like arthur's about to play.  binky: go, arthur.  kids: shh. shh.    buster: you show him, arthur.  muffy: it's been a thrilling 15 minutes.  how do you think it's going, ms. frensky.  i can't really see, but i'm sure arthur's winning.  binky: "a" is for "average".  quiet already.   and alan is the winner.   it's okay, arthur.  there are two more matches tomorrow.  if you win both...  i just couldn't concentrate.  francine: arthur.  where are you going.  there's still the postgame pep rally.  uh, thanks, everybody, for coming out and supporting me, and, uh... well, i'm sorry i lost this time, uh...  but there are still two matches tomorrow, and, uh...  okay, francine.  i mean, uh, let's hear it for game number two.   and game number three.   and the interscholastics.   and then... then...     what was that.  will you just get off my back..  why are you angry at us.  we're the ones who've been supporting you.  yeah, there are lots of other average kids we could have picked for this.  : well, thanks for your help, but i think it's better if i just do this on my own.    hello.  buster : have you seen muffy's web site.  you think you know a person.  but today, the poor, innocent students of lakewood elementary found out their beloved checkers favorite was far different than what he had presented himself to be.  this kid is angry.  and then... then...   muffy: yikes.  i wouldn't want to come up against that in a dark alley.  let's look ait again.   do we really want our beloved elementary school represented in checkers by an angry lunatic.  i ask purely as an impartial journalist.  it is for you, the student body, to decide.    what are you guys doing..  why do you ask.  because you're angry.  angry.  i'm not angry.  well, what would you call it.  binky: angry.  george: please don't hurt me.  and stop passing these out.  i told you yesterday i don't want any more pep rallies.  don't worry, mr. hyde.  it's not for you.  "'a' is for 'angry,''b' is for 'brains.' pep rally for brainbefore the game".  i thought you said he was conceited.  muffy: wow.  angryandmean.  i think you need to chill out.  why are you doing this.  is it because i asked you guys to leave me alone yesterday.  if you call what you did "asking." brain may be conceited, but at least he'nice.  we just care about the integrity of checkers.    hey, man, i want to congratulate you.  it took me years to get scary. you did it overnight.  mr. ratburn: and let the second playoff match begin.  you know what.  i concede.  is it my turn.  mom: people get a little crazy over competition.  don't take it to heart.  maybe i deserved it.  it's not like i tried all that hard to stop them from putting down brain when they were on my side.  well, i don't think you should quit something you love just because of what other people think.  i didn't love itit's checkers.  i just thought it would be fun.  it's not fun anymore.   arthur: francine.  want to go to the interscholastics for us.  huh.  brain conceded, too.  he did.  why.  pep rallies.  ah.  listen, i'm sorry muffy and i got a little crazy.  i guess it's just because you hurt our feelings.  we were kind of forgetting that maybe we had hurt yours.  and brain's.  well, thanks for the apology, but i just want to play checkers for fun right now.  oh.  okay.  but who are we going to get, then.  i mean, i'm terrible at board games.  muffy: i don't see why i have to be disqualified from the checkers interscholastics just because i'm adored.  kids : "m" is for "muffy".  "m" is for "modest".  checkers is a quiet game, muffy.  the judges just think it might be better if you represent lakewood elementary alone.  these interscholastic judges are so uptight.  check out my web site for an indepth analysis of how uptight judges are destroying this sport.  go to wwwdot...   mmm...  your move.  hi, everyone, it's me, buster.  if you like all the traditions we have in elwood city, you'll love what i've seen on my travels with my dad.  there are all sorts of cool things other kids are doing with their families and friends to celebrate their way of life.  i've filmed amazing things with my video camera and i'm sending it all back to my friends on my very own video postcards.  they'repostcards from buster.  visit us online at pbskidsgo.org.  you can findarthurbooks and lots of other books, too, at your local library.  captioned by media access gro captioned by media access group at wgbh access.wgbh.org  and everybody that you meet has an original point of view.    and i say hey.   hey.   what a wonderful kind of day    if we can learn to work and play    and get alongwith each other    hey. what a wonderfulkind of day    hey. what a wonderful kindof day.   funding forarthurwith captioningis provided by...  s, proud supporter of pbs kids, helping kids discover the fun of learning not only what theworldcan do, but also whattheycan do.  pbs kids, where a kid can be a kid.  and by a "ready to learn"television cooperative agreement from the u.s. departmentof education through the publicbroadcasting service.  every week...  that's me.  martha speaks is proof positive...  do we love llamas, people.  ...there's nothing like a talking dog.  hello.   you guys are really irritating.  does "irritating" mean "fun".  on your mark, go.  martha speakson pbs kids.  wow.    )
