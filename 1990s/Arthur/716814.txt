 whoa.  whoa.   man: by the authority vested in me, i, theodore roosevelt, the 26th president of the united states, in the year of our lord, 1903, with the direct approval of the committee on towns and cities...  skip to the good part.  do hereby declare the area known as elwood... an official city.   it was supposed to be "elmwood." that's what i wrote on the form.  and for taking 50 acres of swamp and turning it into a thriving lr town, your good friends j.p. morgan and henry ford have donated this statue of you, our founder, jacob katzenellenbogan.  old man: who's that supposed to be.  my name has two ls in it.  and why did you make me so fat.  tear it down.  tear it down.  well, how do you like that, j.p..  crazy old jacob founded a city before we did.  mark my words, henry, in 100 years, no one will know a place called elwood city ever existed.  robber barons.  skinflints.  yeeha.  ratburn: exciting news, class.  elwood city is celebrating its centennial in three weeks, and in honor of the occasion, our class was chosen from 15 schools to stage a musical.   we won. we won.  hey, wait.  is there going to be a big test at the end of all of this.  no, just a big performance.  all right, we're doing a musical.  yay.  putting on a show isn't easy, buster.  i remember when i did my onemanhamlet with puppets in college.  to be or not to be.  that is...   the end of the show.  good night, everyone.  : curtain... curtain.   that performance nearly cost me my perfect gpa.  so we all have to be very focused.  to save time, i've written down all the task involved in creating a musical and put them in this hat.  you'll choose your role at random.  come on, something good.  "narrator".  that doesn't sound very important.  on the contrary.  a singing narrator will be the glue that holds this story together.  it's a very big role.  cool.  "chorus member".  but i'm the best singer in class.  why doiget such a small part.  there are no small parts, francine. only small actors.  "writer"yes.  finally, a chance to write an accurate historical musical.  "dr. ector".  is he the villain.  can i wear a claw.  that says "director," buster.  oh.  oh. you mean, i get to decide how everything looks and tell everyone what to do.  uh... sort of.   this is going to be the weirdest musical ever.   you could wear a claw if you were in the chorus.  muffy: mr. ratburn.  could i help you with the musical's publicity.  making posters, stuff like that.  hmm, i could use some help.  all right, thanks, muffy.  great.  if you just sign this, then we're all set.  it's a standard producer's contract just in case the musical moves to broadway.  i think it'll be good, muffy, but i don't know if it'll bethatgood.  one word for you, brain: alien invasion.  picture this.  the curtain rises, and a giant flying saucer lands on the stage.   then the aliens come out, hundreds of them.  they take over the earth.  but one kid becomes friends with them...  there will be no aliens in my script.  oh, why not.  because this is a historical musical.  we have a responsibility to show events that really happened.  but i did find some exciting things.  did you know that most of elwood city used to be swampland filled with greentailed grebes.  grebes. what are those.  marshland birds of the familypodicipedidae.  are you putting that in the musical.  sure. why not.  because it's boringthat's why.  no, it isn't.  anyway, at least it's not some fantasy.  what's wrong with fantasy.  people love fantasy.  they deserve accuracy.  fantasy.  accuracy.   . la, la, la, la, la, la. .  teacher: good effort, arthur, but the narrator has to be pitch perfect.  let's try that a again.    no, a little higher, arthur.  now lower.  excuse me, ms. krasny, but can i show him.  : . la... .   like that, arthur.  thanks a lot.    i haven't heard such a horrible sound since alberto and i gave the neighbors' cat a bath.  it's like my cow doll with only one battery.  hey, i bet i can sing worse than arthur.   no, i can't.  . la, la, la, la, la, la. .   let me guess.  you came to say that i stink and you should be the narrator.  i'm here to help you, but if you're going to be that way...  no, wait.  sorrycome on in.  i need all the help i can get.    . la, la, la, la, la, la... .  : . ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah...  .   arthur: . and the trees were chopped down for the bustling new town .  . by the women and men employed by mr. katzenellenbogan.  .  ms. krasny: that was better, but you're still not projecting enough.  but i'm singing at the top of my lungs.  you sing from your throat, but it should come from your diaphragm, like this.  don't. you'll embarrass me.  binky: jenna.  you're not chopping on the beat.  it's one...  and two...  and three.  oh, binky, not again.  they take forever to sew.  it's not my fault.  they're too tight.  so why'd you tell me you were a medium.  i am a medium.  my chinos are medium...  what is that.  that's humongatron.  i said no aliens.  he's not an alien.  he's a robot that saves elwood city from the crab people, and you didn't say anything about that.  all right, let's settle down.  class, i said settle down.  mr. ratburn, can you please look at the guest list for the openingnight party.  michelle kwan, yoyo ma, mr. rogers.  you can't invite mr. rogers.  i already did.  he's so sweet.  but we open in one week.  do you really want mr. rogers to see this.   : curtain... curtain.  it could happen all over again.  they'll pull themselves together.  they just need a pep talk.  may i.   we were chosen out of 15 schools to put on this show, but maybe they were wrong to pick us.  maybe they should have picked mighty mountain or glenbrook.  after all, would they be arguing.  no, they'd be working togethersomething we just can't seem to do.  i did read there was an alien sighting here in 1952.  probably just a weather balloon, but...  thank you.  all right, people, let's take it from the top.  that should hold them till opening night.  then we're going to need luck d alca francine: don't worry, arthur.  you still have a week.  it wouldn't make a difference if i had a year.  i just can't sing.  i mean, i can sing, but not like you.  francine, would you like to play the narrator.  me.  it'd be a much better show with you in that part.  and i'd actually like to be in the chorus.  you get to have plastic axes.  please, will you do it.  are you sure this is what you really want.  well, okay.  thanks, francine.  you're a great friend.  yes.   dad, come on, we're already late.  i'll be right there.  i'm getting directions to george's house.  : why are photographers here.  oh, they're for art garfunkel.  art garfunkel is coming.  no, he's already here.   i want emotion out there.  remember, you're not justplayinga grebe. youarea grebe.  grebe. grebe.  where's my flying saucer.  mr. frensky's bringing it in his garbage truck.  it was too heavy for george's car.  can't you go any faster, dad.  francine, i'm driving the speed limit.  but we're 15 minutes behind schedule and...  duck.  what.   you okay.  what's that sound.   both: the flying saucer.  buster's going to kill me.  hey, it's just a prop, sport.  we'll help them think of something.  let's just get there.  oh, could this night get any worse.     mr. frensky: uh... frankie, we have a problem.  kids:and now...  we've got some very special guests in the studio today.  a few of the kids from the lakewood elementary school in elwood city are putting on a musical celebrating the city's 100th anniversary.  they are arthur read, buster baxter, muffy crosswire and, of course, the brain.  welcome to you all.  thanks for having us on the show, larry.  tell me about the musical.  who thought it up.  well, i wrote it...  but we came up with ideas together.  is it easy working together.  do you like it.  oh, yeah. we love it.  we're a team.  we listen to each other.  except they wouldn't let me have my robot.  your robot.  oh, it was going to be so cool.  the aliens were going to invade, and then this robot was coming out...  it didn't make any sense.  it was your craziest idea.  guys, this is live tv, remember.  muffy: you know, larry, i don't know what your agreement with the network is, but i've recently started my own production company, and we could really use someone of your caliber.  i appreciate it, but...  i'll throw in a used car.  i'm afraid we're out of time.  thanks for being on the show, and good luck with your musical.  hi, mom, hi, dad, hi, d.w.  d.w.: hi.  .  what are you doing here.  you have to get back to the musical.  it's about to start.  oh, yeah, and francine is still missing.  she's the narrator.  d.w.what does that stand for.  i don't like to talk about it.  are you really a king.  where's your castle.  are there unicorns in your castle.  thanks for tuning in, folks.  and now, back toarthur.  d.w.: are you sure we've come to the right place.  nothing's happening.  just relax, d.w.  shows always start a little late.  dad: not this late.  still no sign of francine.  we've got to do something.  arthur, you have to be the narrator.  me. why me.  you know all the lines.  you only traded parts with francine last week.  but i can't sing.  the narrator doesn't sing in the first number.  and by the time it ends, francine will probably be here.  no. i can't do it.  i don't have my bow tie, i don't have my suspenders.  ratburn: good evening, ladies and gentlemen.    good evening, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to lakewood elementary's presentation ofoh, elwood.  we kindly request that you refrain from using flash photography, turn off all cell phones and take this time to unwrap any candy or lozenges.   ratburn: thank you.  howdy.  hi, arthur.  d.w.. shh.  : howdy.  this here's the story about a place ya'll know called elwood city.  but what you may not know is, it wasn't always a city.  once, it was just miles and miles of trees.   all: . the valley all around us was nothin' but wood .  . the trees were ripe for cuttin' .  . the timber was good .  . to chop, to stump and stub, a man known as jacob... .  . katzenellenbogan, a lumber tycoon .  . built a busy sawmill beside a lagoon .  . soon wood chips filled the air and got in people's hair .  . axes gleamed, horses teemed .  . chop, chop, chop, timber. .  . jacob katzenellenbogan .  . founded elwood... .  . founded elwood... .  . elwood city... .  . elwood city. .  . so i went ahikin' to find a good spot .  . a place to build a mansion .  . a heavenly plot... .  hello.  where are you.  we've already started.  oh, i see.  just get here as quick as you can.  was that francine.  is she coming.  the garbage truck broke down.  they're hitching a ride.  what about the flying saucer.  you better sit down.  . houses multiplied... .  . jacob katzenellenbogan .  . founded elwood, founded elwood .  . elwood city, elwood city .  . jacob katzenellenbogan. .  but i wanted it to be called elmwood.  darn bureaucracy.   but wait.  not everyone was happy that elwood had become a city.  when the forest was cut down, the beautiful greentailed grebe had lost her home.  what's that.  a grebe.  what's a grebe.  that.  timmy: that's just fern wearing a lot of feathers.  use your imagination.  i am using it.  i'm imagining i have more candy.  . taste the salty tears we "weeb" .  . for the longlost greentailed grebe .  . our sorrows run so very "deeb" .  . for the longlost greentailed grebe. .  arthur: i think it's going really w yeah.  now if only the flying saucer would get here...  don't hold your breath.  it was smashed to bits in the back of francine's garbage truck.  does buster know.  yeah.  he's locked himself in the janitor's closet.  ratburn: buster, open this door right now.  you're behaving very unprofessionally.  buster: i don't care.  i'm not a professional.  come on. buster. we need you.   fern's scene is almost finished.  what are we going to do.  i'll just have to write the flying saucer out.  hand me those napkins.  what about francine.  the narrator's singing part is coming up.  don't worry, she's on her way.  man: yes, sir, this baby's a oneofakind classic.  she may not be a speed demon, but she gets great mileage.   : a duck.  go on, sweetie, take your time.  . while lumberjacks were tickled pink .  . the greentailed grebe, she went extinct.  .   arthur: over the past 100 years, elwood city has grown bigger and bigger, and we've had visitors from all over the world.  some say we may have even had visitors from outside this world.  the year is 1952.  jenna: dear me.  look how high the corn has grown this summer.  binky: yes.  it is a bumper crop.   what is it, boy.  gee whillikers.  is that a flying saucer in the sky.  no, bobby, that is not a flying saucer.  it is probably just a natural phenomenon, such as ball lightning, a rare form of lightning, in which a persistent and moving luminous sphere can travel...  it was going to be the best part of the show.  now no one will ever...  binky: it is simply a misperception...  hey, they're going on without me.  binky: or it could be a weather balloon...   or another type of conventional aircraft, or...  buster: or it's a real alien.   arthur: buster, what are you doing..  "buster".  who is this buster you speak of.  i am...  dr. ector.  behold my claw.  i come from the planet...  korn and have traveled millions of miles to deliver this important message to you, which will be sung to the tune you earthlings call "yankee doodle."  . dr. ector came to earth .  . in a flying saucer .  . had a message to deliver: .  . be a... .  . be a frequent flosser. .  . floss your teeth every night, floss your teeth all day .  . if you floss your teeth with all your might .  . you won't have tooth decay. .  oops.      there will now be a brief intermission.  curtain... curtain.   buster, what were you thinking.  ow. let go of my horn.  i had to do something, brain.  people were falling asleep out there.  you didn't have to destroy the set.  george: aren't we supposed to use this in the last number, mr. ratburn.  um, yes.  we'll just have to improvise.  you're right, brain.  i did ruin everything.  i'm such a failure.  if anybody wants me, i'll be in the janitor's closet.  wait.  it's my fault.  that stuff i wrote about ball lightning wasreally boring.  you two are lucky.  i still have to sing.  and i bet the audience thought the show couldn't get any worse.  muffy: couldn't we just end it now, mr. ratburn.  i've already done enough damage to my producing career.  francine: end the show.  are you crazy.  all: francine.  sorry i'm late.  the streets were crawling with ducks.  well, you haven't missed muchjust the worst thirdgrade musical ever.  that's not what they think.   great.   and when he came out with that thing on his head, i thought i was going to die laughing.  i'm really impressed.  it's got humor, interesting facts, that very poetic piece about the bird.  i liked when the monster tore a hole in the wall.  was he a grebe.  he had feathers.  come on, guys, we've got a show to do.   . oh, elwood city, so proud, so bold .  . now you are 100 years old .  . what were dark forests, bogs and fens .  . is now called home by us children .  . i lift my head and sing to thee .  . oh, elwood, elwood, elwood city. .  hey, you've told us what elwood city was like in the past, but what's it like today.  today.  today things are a little different.  watch out, coming through.  hey, how do you do.  hey, buster, want to get a snack.  you have to ask.   all: . slurping shakes at the sugar bowl .  . the crossing guard is on patrol .  . soccer games... .  . hey, i scored a goal. .  all: . that's elwood city. .  . reading books at the library .  . our clubhouse is in a tree .  . had a comet named after me. .  all: . that's elwood city. .  . when the ice storm blew in, our prospects looked grim .  . we were filled with hunger and fear...  .  all: . but we got together .  . and battled the weather .  . with stories, cocoa and cheer... .  . just like pioneers. .  all: . baseball games with mighty mountain .  . lost a lot, but we're not countin'... .  . hey, don't hog the water fountain. .  all: . that's elwood city. .  . picnics for all sons and fathers... .  . hey, i just met mr. rogers... .  . crosswire motors has super deals... .  . the ice cream shop serves gummy eels. .  . all clues point in one direction... . )
