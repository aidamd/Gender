"good night, venus, good night, mars, "good night, comets, good night, stars, good night, nebulas, and the distant quasars." with short books like this, i can read, like, 20 in one night.  "good night, black hole.  sweet dreams, cosmic void."  i got seven irp points.  not bad.  i wonder how many points i got.  i finished the henry skreever i was reading last night.  just a sec.  i have 16 more books i read yesterday.   arthur: you got 23 points.  how is that possible.  well, arthur, you know i've always been a big reader.  since when.  look at that.  35 points.  that's my francine.  how'd you get so much.  i'm reading a series about teenagers who are descended from norse gods: loki benediktssen and the teenage aesir.  it's gigantic.  and the bigger the book, the more points you get.  if i can make it to 500, i'm going to get a skateboard.  you can win a skateboard.  didn't you read the flyer.  can i get points for reading the flyer, too.  see, right there.  what's that book series called again.  loki benediktssen and the teenage aesir.  wow, this must be, like, on a 14th grade reading level.  i wonder if i can read it all in one night.  "so there was no way vidar and the dwarves "were going to make it to the prom "unless i found the cloak of falcon feathers.  but that could have been anywhere in niflheim." oh, man.  34 chapters to go.  i think i need a short nap.   hurry up, vidar.  if we don't get to camp bifrost soon, we might never get the necklace of tears.  i'm not vidar.  i'm buster.  and i have no idea what you're talking about.  that's because you skimmed all of chapters four and five.  but they were really boring.  and i couldn't pronounce any of the characters' names.   look out.  the fenrir wolf.   i don't like this book.  when it's not boring, it's terrifying.   "dagmar, the captain of the cheerleading squad, is the daughter of which norse goddess."  i don't know.  how am i supposed to remember.   15 points.  that's it.  but francine got 35 on the same book.  that's because you didn't get all the questions right.  you only get points if you answer correctly.   at this rate, i'm not even going to be able to get the bananashaped eraser.   video games.  what happened to all the reading you wanted to do.  i gave up.  i'd be 50 by the time i won a skateboard.  maybe you just need a different book.  why don't you try the one i'm reading.  that's not a book.  sure it is.  it's calledcity of droids.  my friend tomas at the paper wrote it.  he asked me to give my opinion before his agent sends it out to publishers.  what's it about.  a cyborg detective named kilgore who solves crimes in the 22nd century.  a crimesolving cyborg.    today we'll learn about the early history of our very own elwood city...  man: psst. buster.  who said that.  detective travis kilgore.  cyborg model xt25.  crime unit.  i need your help.  the alien spy from the arctonos system discovered dr. ko's secret formula.  we need to stop him before he delivers it to the enemies of the federation.  oh, okay.  what should i do.  come with me.  there's a teleporter over here.  buster, what are you doing.  i'm helping detective kilgore chase the alien spy who stole...  oh...  it's something that's happening in my book.  you're really into that book.  do you get a lot of irp points for it.  i don't know.  let me ask.  mr. ratburn, how many points can i get for readingcity of droids by tomas greenberg.  let me see.  what did you say it was called.  city of droids.  hmm, don't know that one.  i'm sorry, buster, the book is not listed.  there's no test.  what.  you mean i can't get any points.  not every book has a test in the irp computer network.  in fact, they've omitted many of the classics.  notreasure island, nowatership down...  see for yourself.  i've wasted the last three days reading a book that doesn't even have a computerized quiz.  i wouldn't call it a waste if you've enjoyed the reading experience.  but i would have enjoyed it a lot more if it got me a skateboard.  francine: cheer up, buster.  you still have time to read the loki benediktssen octology.  or at least one of the books.  i didn't like those books.  i like this book.  a lot.  what does liking books have to do with anything.  irp is about reading a lot very quickly and remembering every single detail.  but i did read a lot.  you should giveloki another shot.  it's not that bad.  who knows, you might win some marbles.  kilgore: just not the right book for you, huh.  tell me, buster, why do you need to read for points anyway.  just read the rest of my book.  well, it's not really a book yet.   at least not according to irp.  of course it's a book.  it's got a plot, doesn't it.  an exciting plot.  and great characters, too.  loki: dude, give the little man a break.  maybe he wants to read about the teenage son of a norse divinity and win prizes while he's reading it.  listen, "dude," maybe he should read the book he actually enjoys reading.  well, my books are on top of the young adult bestseller list.  so take that.   whoa.  i can't believe this is actually happening in my room.  it's not.  it's a metaphor.   there.  now just finish the book and get the skateboard.  kilgore: what.  and read this massmarket formulaic trash.  how'd you do that.  i timetraveled back through a wormhole.  sweet.   want to do this, but...   i always knew you were a bore.    that's it, i'm outta here.  i got enough people reading my book.  what do i care whether you get a skateboard or not.  well, kid, my work here is done.  it's all up to you now.  yes, the big day is finally here, children.  time to cash in those irp points for goodies and prizes.  i can't believe this origami swan cost me 75 points.  what are you getting.  well, i only ended up with 38 points, so i got this straw.  not bad.  so i guess you decided to give up going for the skateboard.  yep.  the cyborg detective book was just too good.  francine: what.  this thing for 500 points.  i read nonstop for two weeks.  you know, you could just get two beanbag kittens.  they're adorable.  or get thisloki benediktssen and the teenage aesircalendar.  i'm so sick of that series.  i never want to read a word of it again.  anyway, arthur, you've got to readcity of droids.  it's the most amazing story.  once you pick it up, you never want to put it down.  psst, buster.  and now...  i'm miles.  this is my third grade class.  this class loves to read.  we are recommending books.  there would be two partners.  one of them would ask questions like...  "what kinds of things do you like to read about." miles: you find out what they like so then you can recommend books.  i learned that he likes informational books.  i foundhuman footprint.  what do you think.  i think i would read it.  thanks for the recommendation.  buster learned that it's about reading what you like.  what are the genres of books that you enjoy reading.  humor.  humor means funny books.  i was thinking the hoboken chicken emergency.   i think i made a good recommendation for the chicken book.  very funny.  what is the most important thing you think about when you are picking a book to read.  if it has action or suspense.  my plan is to go to the geronimo stiltonseries.  this is the new one.  the mystery in venice.  i think you're going to really like this book.  i have read it, too.  i really liked it.  so i have to find another book.  geronimo stilton, secret agent.  well, this is another book that i have read.  i keep picking books that he's already read, but i think he read them because he likes the books, so i think i'm making good choices.  "i'm looking for an adventure book or a friendship book." lost in the labyrinth.  i think you'll like it because you said you like adventure books.  it looks kind of creepy.  i learned that she does not like creepy books.  this is calledclementine's letter,and it's not creepy.  this looks like a good book for me.  if you want to have fun reading, there's a lot of books you can read.  i'm reading currently the son of neptune, and i really like it because i guess it's just my style.   and now...   quadroblast:magnopus cybertroid, surrender the lightmass or suffer the full force of quadroblast.  magnopus: no.   quadroblast:nice try, magnopus, but your cyberdynamos are no match for quadroblast.  now, will you surrender the lightmass.  magnopus: no.   wow.  eh...  "eh." that was the best movie ever.  oh, buster...  why didn't you like it.  well, first of all, how could some car mechanic build a thousand giant robots in his garage.  if there's anything that you can count on, it's that buster and brain will never agree about a movie.  the other thing you can count on is that one of them is not going to be happy about it.  ...before the secret lab was invaded by quadroblast's nano robots...  brain: and then for no reason, the bad robots all suddenly fly to jupiterfor what, robot spring break.   and i'm sorry, but you can't blow up an entire planet that is 317 times bigger than the earth with one weird glowing bomb thingy.  the lightmass.  whatever.  it was all just an excuse for a lot of explosions.  oh, brother.  i know.  i see what he means.  yeah, you're right, brain.  that movie had lots of problems.  it stunk.   i don't get it.  everybody liked the movie.  we all said, "wow." then they all changed their mind because of brain.  well, he did make some good points.  he didn't even get the plot right.  "some car mechanic in a garage." no, the car mechanic had a bionic brain.  okay, but still, brain is pretty smart about movies.  i know about movies, too.  as much as he does.  bitzi: oh, there you are.  come on, we're going to the movies.  we are.  cool.  our film critic called in sick today, so i've got to write the review for the friday paper.  what movie.  wow.  wow.  i don't know what to say about that thing.  it was just a lot of explosions.  mom, that's not true.  i've seen the movie twice now and the story makes perfect sense.  really.  oh, that's great, honey.  could you explain it to me, then.  you mean you want to know what i think about a movie.  yes.  please.  "and so while adults might find giant exploding robots "loud and hard to follow, "on the evidence of my son's enthusiasm, the film is clearly just the ticket for eightyearold boys." so, what do you think of that.  and she's a grownup.  yeah, and she didn't like it either.  just like brain.  it stunk.  uhhuh.  well, i'm not finished yet.  you know, i've always wanted to try my hand at film criticism.  muffy: oh, you should, brain.  you'd be really great at it.   "the kid's corner: movies from a kid's perspective.  "hi everybody, my name is buster baxter.  "i'm eight years old, and this is what i think about giant exploding robots 3d." wait a minute.  you wrote something for the paper.  "nobody understands this great movie.  "it is not just a lot of explosions.  "the inventor is not just a car mechanic.  "his dad was a scientist who put a bionic brain in his head "when he was a baby.  "the bionic brain makes him insane when he grows up "and so he builds armies of robots.  "there are good and bad robots, and they have amazing battles, "and i won't tell you the end "except that it's totally believable "something 317 times as big as earth can blow up.  "after all, what is a supernova.  can anybody tell me that. huh." is this for real.  uhhuh.  last night, when i told my mom all about the movie, she got this idea to have us both write reviews.  "on the buster scale, giant exploding robots 3d rates a ten." tenplus.   not to rain on your parade, buster, but that analysis is riddled with...  francine: "on the buster scale." wow, you have a scale.  you know, come to think of it, that inventor was insane.  yeah, he was.  the movie makes a lot more sense now.  it was a tenplus.   i don't get it.  everybody hated the movie.  they said it stunk.  then they all changed their minds because of buster.  well, he did make some good points.  he didn't make any points.  "there are good and bad robots, and they have battles." what kind of critique is that.  look, it's just one review.  i mean, it's not like he's going to write another one.  look, everybody.  another one.   mom's editor said people liked reading what kids thought, and so he wants me to write one every week.  "last week i told you about giant exploding robots 3d.  "well, this week's new movie, aliens, aliens and more aliens 3d..." "superheroes vs. robots 3d..." "you have never seen a movie like tiny exploding monsters 3d..." "first, what could be better than that title.  it tells you all you need to know." "there are not one, but ten superheroes, and each has a different superpower." "who would have thought monsters could be tiny but dangerous." "the movie has something very important to say: beware of aliens." "on the buster scale, a tenplus."  yeah, that's it.  that's it.  here's your refill, mr. baxter.  thanks, kid.  say, can i maybe ask your opinion about something.  if you make it quick.  well, my friend and i are going to the movies tonight, and he wants to see robot aliens 3, but i kind of want to see alien robots 4.  now, i know you loved them both, but which one do you...   this seat taken.  nope.  what are you doing.  just writing my review ofattack of the monster superheroes.  tenplus.  we'll see.  it's not in 3d.  what are you doing.  oh, just working on my blog.  blog, huh.   that's nice.  what are you blogging about.  movies.  really.  you have a movie blog.  oh.  sorry, sir.  that's cool.  sure are an awful lot of movie blogs out there though.  hope yours doesn't get lost in the shuffle.   here it is.  oh, and it's aboutattack of the monster superheroes.  that's the movie you're reviewing right now, isn't it, mr. baxter.  guess he beat you to it.  that's the problem with newspapers.  it takes so long to get a review in print.  "some critics will try to convince you "thatattack of the monster superheroesrates a tenplus, but let's be serious..." okay, this has gone far enough.  you're just trying to attack me.  well, it's lazy reviewing.  every movie can't be tenplus.  and why don't you review some movies that don't have explosions in them.  no movies don't have explosions in them.  true.  well, at least i don't hate every movie like you do.  that's not true.  okay, name one movie you like.  simple.  um...  uh...  oh.  le rgle du jeu.  both: huh.  jean renoir film.  1939.  black and white.  really beautiful dark farce about...  listen, i think the solution to this conflict is very clear.  only one of us can be right.  yes.  so let's prove it.  yes.  you don't mean a fight, do you.  no.  we both review the same movie and see which review changes all our friends' minds.  sounds logical.  but what if you both agree about the movie.  we never agree.           : le murmure de silence.  with english subtitles.  can you handle it.  don't worry about me.  well.  well what.  who's right.  how can we tell.  we haven't seen the movie yet.  it doesn't matter.  yes, it does.  you know, we do have our own opinions.  that's debatable.  you said it, brother.  i think you guys have watched too many bad movies.  your brains are mushy.  wait, you haven't told us who's right.  it's me, arthur, isn't it.  come on, arthur, you know you agree with me.  we read your reviews because we respect both your opinions.  but you two have to learn to respect other people's opinions.  is he right.  i'm not sure.  maybe.  well, at least we agree about that.   maybe we should just agree to disagree.  i can live with that.  you liked it.  you didn't.  but it had subtitles.  but it had no explosions.  it was so sad.  sad.  it was sappy.  i'd rather watch a robot explode.  let's see more foreign films now.  so long as they're more exciting than that one.  whicharthurcharacter are you.  she's like the brain.  cool, i'd love to see that in action.  spell "vacation." ..  genius can't be rushed.  ..  come on, brain, think, think.  ...tion.   yay, you did it.  much you have learned, o bigheaded one.  all: whicharthurcharacter are you.  wow fact.  announcer: pbs kids has the wild kratts weekdays.  ride with your favorite bros as they track down amazing creatures.  wow.  get wowed weekdays on pbs kids with the wild kratts or watch anytimeon the pbs kids video app.  funding forarthuris provided by: the best time to play is anytime.  chuck e. cheese's isa proud sponsor of pbs kids.  and by contributionsto your pbs station from: to watch morearthur and play games with allthe elwood city friends, visit pbskids.org.  you can find arthur booksand lots of other books, too, at your local library.  captioned bymedia access group at wgbh access.wgbh.org ..  curious george.  and because you're curious, george needs ..  george: hahaha.  ..  scientist: i'm one bone short of a dinosaur.  ..  george:..  vo: and join him on all his adventures.  because when it comes to figuring it out man: you fixed it.  ..  george: hahahaha.  vo: it's you and curious george.  weekdays on pbs kids or any time on thepbs kids video app. )
