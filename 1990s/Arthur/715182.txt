"uh" just isn't working for you.  i know.  i tried to lie, but i just couldn't.  well, maybe the sleepover won't be so bad.  yeah.  it's just one night, right.   sure.  can i have your finger paints when your gone.  arthur: dw.  tommy and timmy are here.   what are they doing here.  i don't know.  i didn't ask them over.  maybe they knew i was here.  i bet they've come to get me early.  you've got to hide me.  hi, guys.  how's it going.  we're pooped.   we've been staying up late every night getting ready for our sleepover with james.  we need to borrow some glue.  dw: why.  can't tell you.  it's a secret.  are these james's glasses.  dw: what.  no, no.  those are arthur's.  here, give them to...  wow. arthur sure has a small head.  hey, look, tommy.  i'm arthur.   : dopeydopeydoh...  dw, i didn't take your snowball.   can we borrow some of these stuffed animals, too.  no, you can't.  that's an antique.  dw: here's your glue.  dw: now you have to leave.  i'm very busy.  hey, you want to come over to the sleepover, too.  it's going to be fun.   tommy: hey, we forgot to ask for rope.  timmy: eh, we'll get it somewhere else.  can i stay here for the rest of my life.  you know, now that i've given it some thought, maybe this isn't such a good idea.  buzz off.  hi, james.  ready for the sleepover tomorrow night.  well, not exactly.  tommy and timmy: no.  dw: i think he did it.  poor james.  is that him screaming.  i don't think so.   guys.  guys, take it easy.  no oneeverwants to come for a sleepover.  it's your fault.  you play too rough.  no, you do.  tommy and timmy: sleepover ruiner.  tommy: friend destroyer.  wait. stop fighting.  we can work this out.  we can.  how.  uh...   did you tell them the truth.  yep.  how did it go.  not so well.  excuse me, but i need to get some water.  my throat is dry.    james, are you okay.  you've been so quiet today.  me.  i'm fine.  never better.  dw: well, we're really impressed with how you told the tibbles the truth and got out of that sleepover.  i know.  it worked so much better than "uh..." so what are you doing on saturday.  want to come to the zoo.  maybe.  if i'm around.  if you're around.  what do you mean.  timmy: are you ready, james.  it's time.  see you, guys.    did james come with you to the zoo on saturday.  no.  did you hear from him.  ms. morgan: good morning, everyone.  unfortunately, james won't be joining us today.   but we have a great day planned.  let's start with some fingerpainting.  poor james.  i miss him already.   i know.  he was so...  jamesy.  come on, let's give these to his mom and tell her how much he meant to us.   james. james.  you're alive.  um, well, yeah.  why wouldn't i be.  but... your sleepover at the tibbles'.  how did you survive.  well, it wasn't at all like i expected.  james: their grandma had cooked all this great stuff.   but tommy and timmy were so tired from staying up all night to get ready for the sleepover that they went to sleep as soon as i got there.  so it was just me and grandma.  and, well, their grandma is a really good cook, but i ate way too much.   i've had a tummyache for the last two days.  oh, are those for me.   dw: everyone knows what it means when the wind changes direction.   cheikh, hurry up.  it's when they come to ask their questionthe question every child looks forward to...  yeah, sure you can.  next.  hey, cheikh, so you want to come to our sleepover.  okay, we might have an opening for you.  what are you planning on bringing.  and now...  my name is olivia, and this is my thirdgrade class.  today we are talking about things that make us nervous.  hmm...  boy: when i'm scared, i feel like i have butterflies.  it's like having these in your stomach.  james was scared about going on a sleepover, and i was, too.  i was afraid of going on a sleepover at an aquarium.  i slept next to a tank that had turtles in it.  i was afraid that all the water would spill on me.  i got over it by pretending i was at my house.  girl: if you're nervous, just think of a happy place, think of a happy place, think of a happy place.  i was nervous when i was going to go skiing, because i thought i was going to fall, but it was fun falling.  i was afraid about getting my pet guinea pig lucky.  i had never had a pet before, so i didn't know how it was going to feel.  i learned that it was really fun, and you should try it.  this is what i was nervous about.  on my first soccer game.  because i didn't think i would know anybody.  once i got to soccer, i felt happy, because i knew more people.  and i was scared of going on a roller coaster.  i was afraid of a ride, because it felt like you were flying.  and i was nervous about going on a big water slide, but it was fun.  because sometimes being scared can be fun.  i was afraid of playing ice hockey, because i had never played before.  when i started playing, it turned out to be very fun.  i was nervous about swimming.  my advice would be to take swimming lessons.  i used to be afraid of going to camp.  after a few times of going, it turned out to be fun.  when you go to a new place, you want to have fun and you want to make friends.  whatever you're doing, you should just keep going at it until you've conquered your fear.  it means that you're not really afraid of it anymore.  and after your fear is gone, just have fun.  and now...  it's so roomy.  you can control the temperature on each drawer, and best of all...  instant ice.  ah.  i think this is the best refrigerator we've ever had.  dw: forget the refrigerator.  check out this.  it's a box.  big deal.   that's the difference between you and me, arthur.  you see a box. i see an elevator.   or it could be a mobile home for birds.   or it could be a motorboat.  or a submarine.  or a hotel for lobsters.  or a unicorn temple.  or... you know what, dw.  you're right, it isn't just a box.  it's a big mess waiting to happen.  or library of fake books, or a tap studio...  ahh...  ..  ..  a little to the left.  now to the right.  stop. perfect.  my very own office.  i can't wait to get to work.  what kind of work do you do.  arthur, i'm too busy to explain everything to you now.  if you want to know more, make an appointment.  okay, nadine, we've got a lot to get done, so let's get to it.  i need ten copies of this.  staple them and file them.  done.   could you answer that, please.  good morning, dw's office.  it's the tooth fairy.  tell her nothing's wiggly.  call back in a few months.  sorry, patricia, no teeth right now, but we appreciate your business.   i guess it's time to write the checks.  check, check, check, check.  and here's a check for you.  can i have a raise.  you just got here.  and i've been working nonstop.  fine, fine.  here's a raise.  thank you.  i love my jo well, we love having you.  what now.  juice break.  ahh.  dw, you've got company.  do you have an appointment.  no.  i just came by to borrow some finger paint.  let me check with my partner.  uhhuh.  yeah...  okay.  sorry, we're all out.  who's your partner.  nadine.  she's what you call a silent partner.  anyway, welcome to read and...  flumberghast.  funny, i never knew that was her last name.  is there anything else we can do for you.  you can get my cupcake back from that snackrobber tommy tibble.  remember the other day when it was emily's birthday.  bud: i was excited because no one had taken the one with red icing, and i love red icing, even though it tastes just like any other icing.  and then timmy asked me to hold his juice and i put my cupcake down.  when i went to pick it up again, it was gone.  and tommy had red icing on his mouth.  it may have been the worst day of my entire life.  don't worry, bud.  i may not be able to get you that cupcake back, but i'll at least get you an apology.  come with me.  dw: you owe bud one cupcake.  bud: with red icing.  no way.  i didn't take his cupcake.  he probably fed it to his silly dinosaur.  anyway, what do you care.  she cares 'cause she's my lawyer.  i am.  i mean, i am.  and i demand justice.  oh, yeah.  well, i'm tommy's lawyer.  and i say, prove it.  i will.  i can't wait.  what's a lawyer.  i'm not sure.  i saw it on tv, back when we had tv.  ladonna will tell us.  ladonna: and habeashe's the lead dog of the law firmsays, "then how do you explain this yellow feather, fat cat." it's called habeas canine: legal beagle and it's a great series.  there's a new case in each one and habeas always wins.  except for book ten, but that's a twoparter.  you want to borrow book one, habeas v. fat cat.  um, i can't read.  we just want to know what lawyers do.  well, it depends on what kind of a lawyer it is.  the legal beagles defend clients in a court in front of a jury and a judge.  winning the case means that one side convinces a jury that what they said happened actually happened.  then the judge decides on the punishment, if there is one.  sounds easy enough.  let's take those tibbles to court.  yeah.  we'll get two cupcakes backone for me and one for you.  and nadine.  don't forget the silent partner.  oh, yeah.  sorry.  no.  but it's for a good cause.  justice must be served.  fine, but why do my friends and i have to serve it in our backyard on a saturday.  because you and your friends are so smart, and fair, and wise.  still no.  if you could've seen bud today...  he was a wreck.  he's new here, hardly knows a soul, and then... this happens.  it's not right, arthur.  what if it had happened to you.  you'd feel so... so alone.   okay, okay.  we'll be your judge and jury.  but only for two hours.  and there better be lunch.  how was i.  amazing.  you had me crying, too.   miss flumberghast, i think we've got this case in the bag.  binky: you are hereby summoned to appear before the honorable judge buster baxter in arthur's yard this coming saturday to defend yourself in the case ofcompson v. tibble.  lunch will be served.  relax, tommy, there's no proof.  just do exactly what i say.  we're going to mop the floor with those two.  first off, i'd like to say that you're all guilty.  arthur: buster, we haven't even started yet.  oh, okay.  proceed.  today, i will prove to you that this poor little boy had his cupcake stolen by tommy tibble.  it was mean, and greedy, and justice must be served.  and i will show you that tommy did not steal that cupcake.  in fact, he doesn't like cupcakes.  he doesn't even know what a cupcake is.  it's a muffin, right.  kids: he doesn't know...  amazing.  order. order.  don't worry, i've got a star witness who knows for a fact that he's lying.  then i saw him lick the icing from his mouth.  it may have been the worst day of my entire life.   who are you really, bud compson.  huh.  what is "bud" short for.  um, i'm not sure.  ladies and gentlemen, he doesn't even know who he is.  yes, i doi'm me.  how many cupcakes were on that tray and what time exactly do you claim yours was stolen.  uh...  i don't remember.  i'm done with this witness.  i'd like to call on nadine flumberghast.  i object. she's imaginary.  but she heard directly from uncle wormy, tommy's imaginary friend, that he confessed to taking the cupcake.  young lady, the only imaginary friends allowed in this court are my imaginary friends.  you're welcome, xenon.  we will now take a long break for lunch.  what now.  i don't know.  she was my star witness.  let me think.  there's one more thing we can try, but it's a long shot.  well, mr. compson.  where's your lawyer.  we don't have all day.  she had to run an errand with her daddy, your honor.  but i'd like to call tommy tibble to the stand.  well, what do you want to know.  oh, just... this.  admit it.  uh...  ..  i ate...   dw: hey, everyone.  who wants dessert.  here you go, cupcakes for everyone.  one for you, and you...  and y...  oh, wait, that's right, you don't like cupcakes.  well, i'll just set it right down here anyway.  is that a bald eagle.  kids: huh. seriously. where.  sorry, my mistake, it was just a cloud.  now let's get back to the trial.  so, tommy, you say you don't like cupcakes, is that right.  mmmmm.  i can't hear you.  could you please speak up.  mmmmmmmm.  the court commands you not to mumble.  sweet petunia.  i did it.  i ate it.  i ate bud's, too.  it's the red icing.  i can't resist it.  i don't know why.   thank you, dw.  those cupcakes you brought out were delicious.  but justice tastes even sweeter.  well, there goes our office.  yep.  shut down because of recycling day.  will you miss it.  are you kidding.  it was so stressful.  i'm happy to wait another 20 years before i go back to one.  and now: i thought you might like to see how i draw...   we start with this large "u" shape and we'll do sort of a wavy line for the top of her hair, two circles for her eyes, then we'll add the dots.  and two little lines for her nostrils and a nice big curve for a smile.  and now we'll add her hair and her ears.  and there you have d.w.  announcer: what had 4 sets of eyes, travels in a pack, and looks like an aardvark, walrus, cheetah, lizard, falcon, rhinoceros, hippopotamus.  brothers kratt.
