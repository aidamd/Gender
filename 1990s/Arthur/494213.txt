  every day when you're walking down the street    everybody that you meet has an original point of view.     and i say hey.   hey.   what a wonderful kind of day    if we could learn to work and play    and get along with each other    you got to listen to your heart   . listen to the beat    listen to the rhythm, the rhythm of the street    open up your eyes, open up your ears    get together and make things better by working together    it's a simple message and it comes from the heart    believe in yourself    for that's the place to start    and i say hey.   hey.   what a wonderful kind of day    if we could learn to work and play    and get along with e  hey.   what a wonderful kind of day    hey. what a wonderful kind of day.   hey.  arthur: hey, d.w.  hey.  whoa.   anybody here.  d.w. is so easy to fool.  she'll believe anything.  like one time i told her sweaters were a kind of animal.  i'm not afraid of you.    and i told her that if you stayed in the tub after you pulled out the plug...  whoa.  you'd get sucked in.   she wouldn't take a bath for weeks.  yep, she'll believe anything.  d.w.: arthur.  did you find anything.  no monsters.  at least none i noticed.  just try not to think about them.   ah.   hey.  oops.  i told her my bunny poster could tell me if she came in my room when i wasn't there.  wow, it must be great to have someone as gullible as d.w. for a sister.  is it ever.  you want to come over and play fool the mule.  sure.  uh, brain.  what's "gullible" mean.  easy to fool.  oh, right.  i forgot what it meant.  yeah, that d.w.she sure is gullible.  man: hello, partners.  how are you doing.  fine. where's mrs. hurley.  she's gone out of town.  i'm holding down the fort.  that'll be ten dollars.  ten...  dollars.  don't you know.  new rule: ten dollars to cross the street.  i'll take that in small bills, please.  but... but we don't have ten dollars.  you mean you expected to cross the street for free.  no, but we always did before, sir.  well, i guess you can pay me later but don't take too long or i'll send my goons after you.  ten dollars to cross the street.  that's $50 a week.  i'm lucky i live on the other side.  piggy bank: i contain $5.37. oink.  arthur, i can't afford to walk home from school.  muffy: bailey, stop here.  brain, where have you been.  no one's seen you since third grade.  i could only cross the street $5.37 worth.  this is as far as he would let me come.  as i always say if you want service, you have to pay for it.  wait.  i need $4.63 so i can...  get across.    we can't even pay for today.  you think he'll...  send his goons.  arthur, what are goons.  i was going to askyouthat.   who are you.  are you the goons.  of course not.  we're baboons.  the goons'll be along later and they're reallyscary.  we don't even know what he's sending after us.  we have to stay calm.  we'll come up with a plan by tomorrow.  the mean crossing guard is only there in the afternoon, right.  right.  so all i have to do is find a way home.  here are my ideas.  plan "a": the bridge.  ten dollars.  drawbackstoring it.  plan "b": the tunnel.  eww.  aah.  drawback: directions.  i want that.  plan "c": the balloon.  give it to me.  hey, you, i want that.  drawback:..   crashlanding in a strange country populated by strange creatures and having to declare myself "wizard."  gee, you really thought this out.  yeah, but none of my ideas work.  i just need a functional plan.  you sure you don't want to come over.  i better save my money.  good thinking.  well...  here goes.  here's half of the twosome.  where's your partner in crime.  we didn't perpetrate any criminal acts.  you sure i haven't seen you on a "wanted" poster someplace.  maybe down at the post office.  no.  well, watch your step now.  i'm on to you.  one false move, boyoit's into the slammer.  crossing guard...  ten dollars...  have to get across.  if only i hadn't crossed the street so much my parents wouldn't sell our house.  living in a tent might not be bad.  it might be fun.  i wonder who bought our house, anyway.   home, sweet home.  ahh.  what's the point.  i can't think anymore.  if only my parents moved...   everything would be fine.  you could stay over tonight.  grandma thora's babysitting and she says yes to anything.  really.   i'll go straight to your house and call my parents from there.  here they are.  oh, we're not crossing today, sir.  i hope you aren't planning to cross at some other stop sign.  i got cameras everywhere.  brain: in theory, it's possible.  cameras can be made quite small even small enough to fit in this.  whoa.   you think he has cameras in there.  could be.  better talk in code.  the... penny jar... sure is mean.  that's right.  it's almost as bad as the rug.  what..  d.w.: arthur.  come check my bed.  there's nothing there, d.w..  go to sleep.  you know it's bad when i don't feel like torturing d.w.   i've got it.  wake up, i know what to do.  could you, grandma.  of course, arthur if you're sure that's what you want.  yay.  see you after school.  brilliant idea, arthur.   grandma thora's cab company at your service.  who needs a ride home.  it's very nice of you to drive me home.  why are we stopping.  someone's in the crosswalk.  he sees us.  brain: duck.  what's going on back there.  fasten those seat belts.  arthur: shh, grandma.  he'll see us.  who, ted.  you know him.  he's the meanest man ever.  ted. oh, he's a pussycat.  he wants money.  grandma thora: what..  we'll just see about this.  he sure looks mean.  he's the meanest ever.  he said he'd send his goons after us.  and turn brain in to the police.  he has cameras in all the stop signs.  you're saying you actually believed all this.  that's the funniest thing ever.  you guys'll believe anything.   grandma: arthur, alan.  this is ted glass.  he wants to say something.  go ahead, ted.  i just wanted to tell you i was sorry if my kidding around gave you two a scare.  oh, that's all right.  we didn't really believe it much.   i was pretty sure he was joking about the cameras.  yeah, you'd have to be pretty gullible.  i guess even smart people believe dumb stuff sometimes.  d.w.: arthur.  come here, hurry.  see you tomorrow, brain.   i think i heard something move.  you'd better watch out, it could be a...  a what. a what.  actually...  there aren't any monsters under the bed, d.w.  i was just fooling you.  oh, i know that.  i always have.  but could you check anyway.  please.  i figured i shouldn't scare her.  good idea.  she's liable to believe anything.  hello, boys.  hi. hello.  wait. don't you need the password.  that's right.  you boys are crossing into enemy territory now.  could be inhabited by goons.  could be worse, i hear.  you'd better watch your step.  kids:and now...  when i was little, i thought the tv can go on by itself.  now i know that my mom used to turn it on with the remote control.  everybody used to believe something.  when i was little, i thought that spaghetti was worms.  but when my mother gave me some to eat, it was good.  it was not worms.  i used to think tomatoes were apples.  now i know they're tomatoes.  when i was little, i used to think there was a monster in the closet.  but now i know there's no such things as monsters.  once i thought my refrigerator was a restaurant because it was full of food.  but now i know it's just a refrigerator.  i used to think that books could talk.   but now i know that books can't talk.  whoop.  but i read them.  i used to believe that what was on tv would come right out of the tv.   and now i think it's just a tv show.  i used to think that a basketball was a bouncing orange.  now i know an orange is an orange and a basketball is a basketball.  i used to think that the city buses were just buses but now i think they're alien spacecraft and that they're going to shoot me with their lasers.  all: what do you believe.  and now...   it's really nice when you have a perfect family.  here you go, sona nutritious lunch neatly packed for you.  gee whiz, thanks, mother.  dad: son, would you like a ride to school.  golly, father, thanks a million.   both: hello, mrs. read, hello, mr. read.  hi, kids. hi, kids.  arthur, are you ready.  we can't break our record for being on time to school.  i'll be right there.  you see, my life is just about perfect.  except for one little thing...   can you guess.   where's my breakfast.   come back here.  i'm hungry.     okay, okay, so i'm slightly exaggerating...  these corn puffs are soggy.  i won't eat them.  but only slightly.  and i'm not going to preschool either.  i'm sick of it.  i'll do what i want.  do you hear me. do you.  francine: one for you and one for you.  and, arthur...  wake up.  i'm inviting you to my birthday party.  i'm sorry, i can't go.  i'm too tired.  the party's not for two more weeks.  you'll get sleep.  but d.w. has gone nuts.  last night she wouldn't stop screaming.  d.w.: you're making me go to bed because you don't want me around.  you don't love me.  you wish i wasn't even born.  sleep tight, d.w.  let's hope you feel better in the morning.  iwon'tfeel better in the morning.  i won't, i won't, i won't.   i won't.  she did that all night long.  what if she never lets me go to sleep again.  that experiment would be interesting.  we could chart your brain's deterioration...  why not just ask her what's wrong.  why don'tyouask her.  okay, i will.  francine: thanks, mrs. read.  my pleasure.   d.w., one at a time.  you're always picking on me.  you never pick on anyone else.  you know that's not true, d.w.  everybody has to eat politely, including you.  you never include me.  you make me stay home whenever there's anything fun.  only arthur gets to have fun.  d.w., can i ask you a question.  maybe.  what's the matter with you.     greatyou really solved the problem.  i didn't think she'd get so upset.  it's not your fault.  may i be excused.   i'm sorry, d.w.  i didn't mean to hurt your feelings.  but you really are being a total doofus.  : who asked you.  you don't even live here.  nobody asked me.  i'm arthur's friend.  i want to help him.  you know what, francine.  what.  go... go...  oh, i'm too tired to think of any more mean things to say.  brain: did francine figure out d.w.'s problem.  no, last night she slammed so many doors i thought we'd get arrested.  announcer:join us for another nervewracking half hour oftemper tantrum patrol squad.    thank heavens you're here.  upstairs and to the right.  you have the right to remain silent...  i will not be silent.  i'll be as loud as i want.  and you can't stop me.  no one can.  who madeyouthe boss.  we need backup, fast.  cool. when is that going to be on.  i think d.w.'s being a pain because she's upset about something.  what does d.w. have to be upset about.  she's only four.  yeah, it's not like she's a thirdgrader.  but something's bothering her and we must find out what, starting today.  we have soccer practice.  starting tomorrow.  i'd love to, but i have to clean the garage.  and i have to... clean our garage, too.  yeah, ha, wow, what a coincidence.  thanks alot,guys.  anytime.  arthur: subject in view.  what's she doing.  eating her sandwich.  she's making a face.  she's spitting out the bologna and throwing it into the bushes.  pal is eating the bolo...  pal. put that down.  quiet. spies don't yell.  sorry, i couldn't help it.  seeing pal eat spitcovered bolognayuck.  give me those.  where'd she go.  ah. i know what you're doing, and it won't work.  arthur: she's not saying anything.  and it's 10:00 and i'm tired.  whatever it is, she'll say it in her sleep.  you can't give up.  wait, this might be it.  oh... it's wrong...  something wrong...  "it's wrong... something's wrong..." because...  "because..." because arthur is a dodo brain.  "because arthur is a dodo brain."  stop laughing, francine.  arthur: if we can't figure out what's wrong with d.w. today then i give up.  i'm telling you, we're close.  then you can sleep.  there she is.  girl: we'll go to the movie and then you can give me my presents at my house.  remember, saturday at 1:00.  she's looking right at us.  not usthem.  hey, d.w.  francine, can i ask you a question.  sure, anything.  why don't you go back to your own house and stop bothering us.  d.w., this being rude to everybody has got to stop.  well, i know something that might make feel better.  if i could see quazy kool kittens: the journey home at 1:00, saturday.  you've seen that movie twice.   arthur and i would love to take her.   how could you make me do this.  you want to find out what's wrong with d.w., right.  you better be right.  even d.w. isn't having fun.   what are you doing.  : having funloads and loads of fun.  oh, hi, d.w.  hi, lisa, i didn't knowyou'dbe here.  me and my friends are having lots of fun.    i have lots and lots of friends.  i'm really popular, and i usually get invited to a lot of birthday parties.  : oh, that's nice.   well, maybe the previews will be interesting.  i don't feel well.  i want to go home.  d.w., we just got here.  wait, what am i saying.  let's go.  greatwe spent all that money and still don't know what's wrong except she's driving me busalooey.  and you know i hate that word.  d.w. and i are going to get some ice cream. )
