feels great.   cut it out.  hey, grandma, arthur's splashing me.  and he's scratching, too.  i know it's hard but rule number one is no scratching.  you'll get an infection.  if you're good and don't scratch i'll bring you a balloon from the circus.  i have a wonderful idea, d.w.  go to your room and draw a picture.  i need to guard arthur so he doesn't scratch.  i think we can trust him.  d.w.: well, i don't.  hmm...   i saw. you scratched.  grandma, arthur scratched. i saw him.  that's nice.  aren't you going to punish him.  well, sweetie, i think this will make arthur feel much better.  grandma, when do i get to drink with the crazy straw.  you don'tit's covered with germs.  your lunch is over by the sink, d.w.  hmph.  grandma: so i warned your father, "get the car started because this little baby is on its way." what little baby.  arthurthis is about the night arthur was born.  anyway, he never did get the car started what with that busted carburetor so i went in and called a taxi.  was i worried you'd be born right here in the kitchen.  where was i.  you weren't born yet, hon.  ahh.  hmm.  what about when i was born.  i think i was in florida then.  can i have a back rub, too.  maybe later... i'm busy making arthur some tea.      d.w. : oh, i don't feel well.  good heavens, you have them, too.  d.w.: i need a oatmeal bath.  of course, dear.  : and some... juice with, uh...  a... crazy straw.   absolutely.   are you all right in there.  : i... guess so.  well, i brought you some nice...  : w., what happened to all your spots.  i got better.  : dora winifred, i'm very disappointed in you.  daddy, it's not fair.  how come arthur gets chicken pox and i don't.  honey you're luckychicken pox is no fun.  yes, it isit's more fun than anything.  more fun than the circus.  more fun than elephants and cotton candy.  of course.  you decideif you don't want tosufferthrough the circus you can stay home with arthur.   so... can you come to the circus.  just a minute.  your spots are healing and i don't see any new ones...  no sign of a fever...  yes. i'd say all systems are go.  yes.  i decided i'm going to the circus.  atta girl. after all, how bad could it be.   i only wanted pox because i was jealous.  oh, honey... i know you want to go to the circus...  : you're being very grownup but we have some bad news...  what's so funny.  spots.  now, d.w., i want you to be a big girl and...  d.w.: i have my very own chicken pox.  spots, spots, spots.  spots, spots, spots.  look at me, palspots.  she must have a fever.  grandma, can i have all that stuff now.  a tray and a bath and everything.  strangest case i've ever seen.  okay, d.w., you want a bath, you've got it.  arthur, arthur, arthur, look at me.  i have spots and you don't.  but you're going to miss the circus.  who cares.  the circus comes every year but you only get chicken pox once.  kids: and now...  it's bad to be sick.  it doesn't feel good.  you have to have medicine that you don't like.  you feel sort of wheezy.  all you can do is lie on the couch.  watch tv and go to sleep and rest.  you get to do things that you usually don't get to.  sleep late.  watch movies.  my parents get me breakfast in bed when i wake up.  you miss out on some things.  you can't have any friends over.  you never go outside.  and you can't go to school.  when i had the chicken pox was not good.  one time, i was in kindergarten and i got the chicken pox.  child: i had the chicken pox.  child 2: i had chicken pox.  child 3: i got the chicken pox.  "i have chicken pox." child 2: each one a huge, ugly, gross pimple "gushing blobs of pus "each one looking like a volcano erupting "spreading green streams of fiery lava down my cheeks.  "itchy, scratch.  i want to rip them off my face and stick them to my sisters." child 4: you should wear your jacket when you go outside.  child 5: wash your hands.  child 6: eat healthy food.  child 6: eat an apple a day.  and now...   arthur: good boy.  now, what's a worm do.  i haven't had pal for long, but he's learned a lot already.  he learned that he shouldn't sl out of hicoar during a walk.   no, pal.  heel.  heel. stop.  sit. stay.  wait.      i told you to heel.   and he learned that dad's garden hose isn't a chew toy.  no, pal, no.  look at all the teeth holes.   don't worry, i fixed it so dad will never notice anything's wrong.  oh.  dad: arthur.  want to go for a walk.   hi.  d.w.: mom.  arthur's feeding pancakes to the dog.  just one little piece.  arthur, you know pal has his own food to eat.   done with this page.   want some jelly worms.  i can't remember if they're from this halloween or lt year's.   after you chew for a while it's a lot easier.  sorry, boy.  that's all.  arthur, lunch.  mom: arthur, what did i tell you about feeding the dog.  i wasn't.  d.w.: want to hear a good joke.  knockknock.  the dog's got my wiener.  dad: arthur, tell pal to let go.  pal, let go.  it's mine, it's mine.  pal, sit.  heel.  stay. lie down.  um... roll over.  give it back.  i don't eat your dog food, do i.   i'll never let go, never.  someday i'm going to teach that dog a lesson he won't forget.  surrender now, bionic bubble brain.  never.   hey, pal.  you okay.   arthur: mom. dad.  mom. dad.  he made a noise like a car horn underwater.   that's it, see.  if he gets worse, we'll take him to the vet.  he'll have to go to the vet.  my aunt's chameleon escaped from the vet.  he slipped out of his cage, changed colors and slithered into the air vent.  we lost him.   luckily, pal can't change colors or slither into a vent.   brain: arthur, the vet will find out what's wrong.  vets know how to talk to pets.  so what's the trouble, mr. pal.  arthur : my tongue hangs out and i go...  you go...  no... .  oh, i'll have to operate.   would you like a blindfold.   maybe pal will feel better and you won't have to go to the vet.  yeah, maybe.  bye.  arthur: come on, pal, time for your walk.  i said it's time for your walk.   mom, dad.  pal doesn't want to go for his walk and that's his favorite thing.  i thought eating the hose was his favorite thing.  what's wrong, boy.  bring him in, mr. read.  man: dog not feeling well, arthur.  no.  i'm sorry.  victoria got tied in a knot.  oh, don't force it, honey.  don't force it.  my snail's been acting sluggish.   what did the vet say.  pal will stay here overnight.   but, dad...  he's never been away from me.  ever.  it's the best way the doctor can treat him.   come on, arthur.  : don't worry, pal, you'll be finebye.  i must be allergic to something.   yeah.  look on the bright sidenow we can get agooddog.  mom.  .  what.  i didn't mean to upset you at dinner.  hmm.  i want you to know i felt the same way when my bird died.   arthur: mom.  d.w.: what.  what did i say.  brain: i bet the vet sends him home tomorrow.  guys...  yeah... right.  of course.  i think d.w. did this to pal.  are you serious.  she always hated him.  let's call the cops and put her in prison.  they won't do thatshe's innocent until proven guilty.  we'll just have to prove her guilty.  i can't believe you want me to play with you.  what are we playing.  we're playing...
