hey, our favorite, neverused wedding present.   wow.  it's beautiful.  how much is it.   hi, fran...   what... is... that.  an ottoman with a foot warmer and tv tray.  arthur's parents let me have it for free.  no, no, no.  this is the last straw.  you are not bringing any more revolting junk into this room.  katherine: first, it was that lamp you got when tastee cone closed.  then it was that ugly lava alarm clock.  and that reptile.  this madness must stop.  what about your things.  lacy curtains lacy, ugly cats lacy pillows...  lacy lace.  so what if my half is lacedriven.  it has a unified theme.  yeah, nauseatingthat's the theme.  you are so ignorant.  just wait till your feet get cold.  then you'll be sorry.  francine: mom, look.  arthur's parents didn't want this.  can you imagine.  uh... possibly.  i might as well hang a sign on our door"toxic taste dump." what do you think about this.  your room's due for a paint job.  new colors will help.  red and purple.  mauve and gray.  everything goes with white.  white. white.  the focus will be on your interior design.  come up with some ideas.  we'll hear them at the family meeting.  hmm.  studying my friends' rooms will give me design ideas.  you have a lot of stuff, muffy.  where's my bed.  i don't think i could ever make my room look like this.  and that's a sacred rock from the amazon.  wow.   ugh.  ow.  the exotic look really isn't me.  this just isn't my style.  it's not my style, either.  it's my mom's style.  now,thisismystyle.    mr. frensky: we will now hear ideas for the room redecorating project.  francine.  tadah.  excellent.  you can shoot hoops from your bed.  disgusting.  it's disgusting, and where's my bed.  francine: right here.  what have you got.  i have something we can all live with.  voila.  where's my bed.  this converts to a cot.  i can't sleep in a clock.  it doesn't matterthose ugly flowers will keep me up all night.  wait a minutei've got it.  i have a brilliant idea.  take all your ideas and put them together into one room.  lower myself to her level. please.  my friends have their own rooms.  no one shares with a frillanoid.  you think i like it.  i'd move in a minute.  i'llmove.  i said it first.  i'm moving.  where.  i love it.  it's like having a loft.   you can't live in the living room if your bedtime is at 9:00.  and the bedroom is all yours.  katherine, the table isn't part of your "room." it's shared space, mother.  it needs a unifying theme.  see. she's like bacteria from a space meteoriteshe spreads everywhere.  : lace...i need lace.  hello.   wow, your own bedroom.  it's like your sister's out of the house.  i still have to share my room.  turning the garage into your bedroom is an excellent idea, d.w.  now kate won't bother you.  finally i have room for all my friends to come visit.   door.  what doyou want, arthur.  do you have any cake.  no. now go away.   but the room doesn't look right.  it seems kind of empty.  maybe you just need more stuff.  if you see anything you like call me and i'll give you a hand.  greatall i find is something katherine would like.  there's nothing that's me.  wait a minute.  wow.   what on earth is that.  uh, it's a bat mobile.  i amsoglad i don't have to deal with this anymore.  i am going to my room.  ah, privacy.     they're so talented.   katherine. a bat. help.  : i'm so glad you don't share a room, francine.     it was just a nightmare.  oh. oh.  i know your room's kind of empty so i brought you something.  this is super.  i got something for you, too.  oh, this is beautiful.  i'll have to put it...  somewhere.  maybe you could put it in your room...  um, your real room.  you mean it.  having my own room isn't as fun as i thought it would be.  a loft isn't as glamorous as i thought it would be.  the walls are so thin.  want to move.  what. what.  we combined our decorative resources.  too bad you didn't think of that.  what a great room, francine.  katherine has such neat stuff.  i wish i had an older sister, too.  you're so lucky, francine.  yeah, i am.  katherine: : feet off the furniture.   and now...  well, i just did the sun, and now i'm doing clouds.  i just love to draw.  i love to put stuff on paper...  or... wood or whatever it is.  i started painting furniture about a year ago.  i painted my desk first because i thought the wood was ugly.  then i painted it all black.  i have a moon in one corner and the rest just covered with stars.  what i'm going to do today is paint a bookshelf half, like, solar system with a moon and planets and stars and half sun with clouds all around it.  i sketched it out.  then i'll just paint it.  you can paint almost anything on furniture.  i mean, it's just like doing a regular painting.  you get to use your imagination a lotyou could do whatever you want.  you just have to be careful and i think you'll enjoy what you've done.  i'm done.  it's very pleasing to see your artwork if you really enjoy it.  and now...  brain: we need this basket to win.  if francine passes me the ball i'll take care of it.  pass it to arthur.  over here.  huh.  go, arthur.  arthur: sorry.    ratburn: arthur's team wins.   don't cheer me.  it was easy.  francine: arthur, arthur.  huh.  if we don't score, we lose.  i'll take care of it.   binky's team wins.  boy, sometimes winning is a lot harder than you imagine.     what can we do for fun.  all: yay.  chorus:  it's new, it's fun, it's number one    what is it.    no guessing.   i win.  announcer: no guessingthe world's greatest quiz game.  it's the most fun you'll ever have.  wow, i want that game.  they say it's the most fun you'll ever have.  more fun than a roller coaster or the last day of school.  i want that game.   does making those faces scare the money into coming out.   i win.  hey, you got it.  yeah, let's play.  "a scientist combined one liter of h2o with nine ounces of soil.  what compound did he make." um... phosphorus.  mudh2o is water, soil is dirt... that makes mud.  you got it wrong, so...   i win.   "a baseball is covered with what material." if you don't know you don't know.  you'll never guess this.  is it... cowhide.   i win.   the site of king solomon's mines...  would that be zimbabwe.  is it.  : yes...   i win.  you don't have to do that just because it was on tv.   stupid game.  let's play "no guessing." i'm not in the mood.  how about something else.  please don't say "i win." okay...  you lose.  after i lost at bowling i lost at video games and checkers.  i lose at everything.  i even lost my glasses.  i'll help you find them for five dollars.  .  they're on your head, arthur.   i guess i'm just a loser.  sometimes luck goes in cycles.  don't worry, you'll win soon.  how about a game of cards before your luck changes...  i mean, to help your luck change.  do you have any threes.  i've never been this close to beating you at cards.  do you have any sevens.  arthur: i can't lose to d.w.  she'll tell everyone.  mmm... no sevens.  go fish.  look, a swarm of lightning bugs.  where.  do you have any nines.  i win.  how could i lose.  i was so close to winning.  now i know, palif my luck won't change itself, i'll make it change.  all i have to do is find the easy questions.  arthur: if i don't get this next question right, you win.  hey, is that a break in the timespace continuum.  what. where..  very funny.  you can't delay losing any longer.  here's your question.  "what is the largest city in france." paris.  each basket in basketball is worth two points.  that's right.   i win.  wow, you got nine questions in a row right.  congratulations.   could i have more lemonade.  sure.  that's called "icing the puck." the equator.  a lobster.  the boston red sox.  i win.  want to play three out of five.  1945.  wait until i ask a question.  hey. that's the right answer.  : what a coincidence.  arthur sure got good.  he never loses.  if it were anyone but arthur, i would think he was cheating.  but arthur would never cheat.   mom: arthur, did you finish your homework.  almost done.  the most exciting thing about winning is when you win.  i love that feeling.  ooh, ay...   i win.  let's go seven out of ten.  you'll just win again.  let's do something else.  when did you put up these mirrors.  they make a room seem bigger.  i can't help it if i win all the time.  i'm just a winner.   oh, did you miss.  that means i win.  you did that on purpose.  come on, it's part of the game.  if you can't take the competition, don't play.  arthur was a bad sore loser, but he's a worse sore winner.  i wish he'd lose again.  how.  he's beaten almost everyone at school at everything.  everyone but binky.  francine: no one wants to play against binky because he cheats.  if arthur loses at his favorite game he might go back to normal.  hey, binky.  hey, i hear you're afraid to play that game against me.  who said that.  it was...  something i thought of all by myself.  so, you afraid or what.  don't you have anything better to do.  all: no.  arthur: with everyone watching, i better not cheat.  binky's losing.  he's creaming you.  why don't you cheat.  i don't know how to cheat at this game.  you got to know stuff.  what did he say.  you don't want to know. )
