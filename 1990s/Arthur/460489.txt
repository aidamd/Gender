"you will change jobs." i don't have a job.  okay, how about buster's.  "big changes in store."  "you feel like a new person." oh, no.    howdy.   howdy, howdy, howdy.     : no time for checkers.  we're training for the nationals.  arthur: whoa.   this can't happen, can it.  can buster have changed that much.  sure, he did a lot of new, exciting things...  but i did stuff that was just as good.    the origin of bionic bunny.  now i've seen it an even hundred times.   wow.   what if buster thinks i'm boring.  i called the airport.  buster's plane will arrive in two hours.  i only have two hours to get ready for the new buster.  a book on mountain climbing and china and wisconsin.  i forgot the sahara desert.  thank you, miss turner.  china...  the alps...  antarctic penguins...   arthur: oh, no.  time's up. buster will be home right now.  man : could be another record for the champ.  woman : in the allcanada knitting finals curcurillo knit an entire flag and a dozen tube socks.  man: uhoh, the champ has jabbed himself.  woman: i see blood.  if the garment is stained, he loses big points.  did buster call.  no, honey.  : oh...   i hope i know enough stuff now.  i'm too nervous to read anymore.  : he's not going to call.  d.w. was right.  he doesn't want to talk to me anymore.    arthur.   i'm sure buster will call you soon.  yeah, right... sure, whatever.   let's play checkers.  checkers..  i will not fritter away valuable time on such triviality.  if checkers is your idea of exciting perhaps you need a new friend.  i went around the whole wide world, you know.   aren't you going to play checkers with bus stop.  busterand i have other friends, you know.  if he doesn't want to come over, fine.  there's brain and francine and muffy.  like flying in a plane makes you a big man.  how interesting can old ruins be.  buster: really interesting.  hi.  hi.  hi, bus stop.  hi, p.w.  : you're silly.  i was organizing your photos.  are you organizing used tissues and old gum, too.  go away.  i brought stuff for you.  presents.  did you see the white cliffs of dover.  buster: yeah, sure.  they were white, all right.  wow.  is this what foreign doctors give shots with.  no, that's...  that's the eiffel tower.  it's 980 feet tallright.  i guess.  i rode on a double decker in london.  in england, a truck is a lorry.  right.  i think sothere was one thing i wanted to do...  to climb mount everest the highest mountain in the world.  no, something exciting...  to walk on the great wall of china.  no, i...  to ride a mule down the grand canyon a gorge in northwestern arizona.  no, no, no.  something exciting.  i wanted to play checkers with you.  just like old times.  really.  buster: i would've come over hours ago but i fell asleep on the ride home.  i thought you didn't want to.  what, and miss this.  did you read all those.  i just started.  you think checkers is exciting.  yeah.  are you sure you went all around the world.  i thought it was exciting before i went.  what'd you think, d.w..  he was going to be all different now.  it was worth coming back just for this.  yay. aw...  i'm glad you still like checkers.  i was afraid you might have changed while i was gone.  after this game, want some cake.  yeah, but only if we can play another game of checkers after.  sure.  and now a word from us friends.  this is jeff.  he's my best friend.  this is my friend alex.  it's too bad arthur missed buster.  i sort of know how he feels.  i couldn't see jeff because he was at camp.  well, now we're catching up.    this is max, and we're best friends.   siobhan is my best friend.  and she's crazy and she likes bugs.  no.  pull.  we're looking for aphids.  siobhan: if max left i would be sad.  we love to play dressup.   let's play tag, max.  you're it.  my name is margo and this is my friend geoffrey.  my name is geoffrey.  this is my friend margo.  today, we're trying to build a house.  it's made out of cardboard and tape.   without geoffrey i couldn't build this house.  margo: black with green trim.  black with a green stripe.  if we disagree, we work something out.  we're doing splatter painting.  our house is done.  kids: and now, back to arthur.   . this is the story about the face on the cake .  . it belongs to... buster baxter .  . baby boy bunny buster baxter was born eight years ago .  . at first all he did was cry and eat .  . and eat and eat and grow, eat and grow...  .  that's all he did.  . he met arthur, they became friends.  it was an historic day.  . they always have lots of fun .  . they like to read and playhey. .  . then one day, buster found out he was going to go .  . going to go byebye. .  . he went around the world a couple of times .  . we thought he'd left the show. .  . buster baxter went away, then he came back .  . buster baxter, this is what he found...  .  it looks just like i never left.  hey.  buster: mmm, great cake.  i got to eat my own face.  that's exactly what i said.  ah, it sure feels good to be back.  i was afraid things would change.  brain: hey, buster.  glad you're back.  while you were gone we started a checker championship: best of 5,000 games.  so far it's a tie.  we're scheduled to finish today.  oh, i forgot.  go ahead, i'll watch.  there's only 70 games left.  but you just came home.  is there a way we can all play.  . arthur didn't want to leave buster out .  . of that he can be proud .  . but when you're playing checkers... .  . three's a crowd. .  you can't move that black piece.  that's my black piece.  no, it's my black piece.  that one's mine and that's yours.  you're jumping your own piece with my piece.  brain is red and his pieces go this way.  i'm black and i go that way.  buster, you have red and black a penny, a stamp and a monopoly shoe and you go that way.  wait, that's... oh, my brain hurts.  maybe i should just watch.  thanksit's only because this is for the championship.  it's just nice to be with friends.  what did you say.  . this is the next day, that's all i have to say, hey. .  buster: arthur, want to see my travel slides.  oh, hi, brain.  what's up.  we're writing a book.  like ours.  sort of the same but not exactly like our book.  you and the brain are writingourbook.  after them.  arthur: we're a perfect team friar brain.  i was able to rescue you using a mathematical formula.  this is a right triangle.  the rescue swing's angle of inclination and velocity were easy to determine.  we'll get you yet.   you changed everything.  some of your situations were unbelievable.  but it was exciting.  now it's logical and exciting.  buster, you weren't around.  you can help us now.  i'll do a scene where pirates ride an apatosaurus and crush buildings.  um... no, dinosaurs and pirates never coexisted.  now they ride horses.  horses don't crush buildings.  they crush flowers.  moose: . buster baxter went away and he came back .  . he was starting to feel like things had changed. .  carpet of doom.  i want to see that.  i'll call arthur.  francine: it's buster.  you went to seecarpet of doom without me.  we didn't go...  we forgot to call you.  i was about to say we didn't go to carpet of doom.  come on, i know arthur wouldn't go to a "kresblain the merry magician" movie.  you always said you hated kresblain.  he's so... blah.  i used to not like kresblain.  francine loaned me all the tapes and i caught kresblamania.   moose: . kresblamania, it's insaneia .  . how could arthur catch kresblamania. .  we have to go, honey.  bye.  . kresblamania, it's insaneia .  . how could buster not catch kresblamania.  .  did you hear that.  he thinks he's so above kresblain.  i think going away turned buster into an snob.  no, you don't...  no.  really.  muffy: he thinks he's superior because now he eats snails.  who wants to trade for a peanut butter and, uh... more peanut butter.  you wouldn't like itno snails.  . life can be tough as nails .  . when your friends think you're a guy who likes to eat snails. .   . the kids forgot they learned to dance .  . when buster wasn't around .  . but boy, did buster know it, he couldn't dosido it. .  . he decided to get out before he knocked everybody down. .  change partners.  promenade.  quack like a duck.  look.  he thinks he's too good for square dancing, too.   . buster was feeling more left out with every passing day .  . even when he found something cool... .  arthur, i found a weird key.  maybe it's the key to a sports car.  when we find out, we can split it 5050.  that's mr. morris's.  you'd better put it back.  . someone else had found it first when he was away. .   francine: kresblain club meeting at muffy's housedon't be late.  you want to come to the kresblain club.  no, thanks.  go ahead.  well... see you.  hmph.  when my family used to travel i felt out of place back at home.  yeah.  that's how i feel.  kids think you're weird if you accidentally use french likec'est la vie.  i was only in france a week.  a week. i was only there a day.  you must be an expert.  no, i'm not, and i didn't eat any snails.  but i watched tv.  announcer: voici le lapin bionique combinaison de technique scientifique de point...  buster: they were the same shows but in french.  you know how bionic bunny always says...  i don't know much about tv.  how about checkers.  i don't like checkerssee you.   i wish buster were here.  the things we do aren't exciting for him.  he didn't want to write a book.  because it had no snails in it.  we have nothing in common with him.  we're still his friends.  if he likes new stuff maybe we'd like it, too.  i never thought of that.  let's throw a party and watch his slides.  we'll see what he saw and have that in common.  all: yeah.    wow.  great ideathis is fun.  didn't you notice.  notice what.  buster isn't here.  nope.  well, that's it.  he obviously doesn't want to be our friend.  why else wouldn't he come.  moose: . he's a sad, sad bunny, a sad, sad bunny .  . tv isn't funny when you're a sad, sad bunnyyeehaw. .  hey. that's not sad music.  : . he's a sad, sad bunny .  . a sad, sad, sad, sad... bunny... .   i can't believe he didn't come.  what did he say when you invited him.  i didn't. francine invited him.  no, muffy invited him.  i thought brain did.  weighing the facts using elementary deduction i conclude that no one invited buster.  you think that's why he's not here.   moose: . buster baxter and his friends got a brandnew start .  . it was just like they'd never... been apart.  .    arthur: that looks so cool.  buster, pass the popcorn.  i thought it was for me.  you ateall that popcorn.  i'm glad we're having fun again.  i thought aliens had replaced you with cyborg twins programmed to make me miserable.  others: he's the same old buster.   moose: . that's how it happened, you can see .  . to buster and the kids in elwood city .  . now they know when you're close friends .  . you can always get back together again.  .  so, how long has the singing guy been around.  what. i thought he came here with you.  . buster baxter went away and he came back .  . buster baxter... .  that was weird.  yeah.  mom.  there's a singing moose in front of the house.  . buster baxter... .  buster: have you ever wondered how anarthurshow is made.  it took more than 100 people almost a year to make the show you're watching.  it all starts off with a great script that gets turned into a storyboard.  doesn't it look like a blackandwhite comic book.  all the actors get together to record in a studio.  i've got to quit, too.  buster: a whole team of artists paints all the scenes.  the director times every movement so that i can be animated.  let's hear it for teamwork.  visit us online at pbskidsgo.org.  you can findarthurbooks and lots of other books, too, at your local library.
