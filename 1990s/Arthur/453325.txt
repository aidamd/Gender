 hey.  whoa.   arthur:know what this is a picture of.  give up.  it's a polar bear eatinga marshmallow in a snowstorm.    hey. i'm over here.  hello.  oh, there you are.  you know what's worse than walking your dog in a snowstorm.  walking your dog in a blizzard.  but you have to walk your dog.  if you have a dog, you know what i mean.  d.w.: arthur.  what..  mom says to come inside.  i'm trying.  .  aah.  hey, did you see a polar bear eating a marshmallow out here.  don't be silly.  there are no polar bearsin this part of the world.  i've been hoping for snow,but this is ridiculous.  weather forecaster: and we'll be getting a light dusting of snow overnight.  arthur: it's snowing.  school might be closed and i'll play in the snow.  the weatherman says it'll be a light dusting.  get back into bed.   who wants just a little snow.   there's snow everywhere and it's still snowing.  why aren't you dressed.  maybe school is closed.  the snow will stop soon and it'll be a sunny day.  no school closings to announce.  why do weathermen never say the right thing.  i hoped school might be canceled.  i couldn't finish my history report.  you couldn't finish a onepage report about the pioneers.  the pioneers didn't have cars or electricity or television.  those people were duuulll dull.  sorry i'm late.  let's jump right into work.  bad newsthe storm is getting worse.  the building has lost electricity so the school is closed.   all right. now i have extra time to do my history report.  hand in your history reports on the pioneers.  i could give you an "f," but i won't.   why are you mad.  he's not going to give you an "f." i have to write athreepagereport while everyone else gets to play in the snow.  that wouldn't have happened if you did it when you were supposed to.  : hey.  "the pioneers crossed the country and had hardships like bad weather." so what.  why didn't they just stay where they were invent airplanes, then cross the country.  duh.   wow. it's so deep.  this is nothing.  i remember one time we had snow over my head.  wasn't that when you were younger than d.w..  oh, yeah, right.   this storm's getting worse.  everybody inside.      welcome to toyland, kate.   dinnertime, pal.   daddy, power's out.  can't finish my report without a computer.  i'm going to build a snowman.  keep working.  i bet i'm the only person in town not having fun.  you fellows can't leave.  i have to get tomorrow's lesson plan prepared.  and i'm hungry.  by the power vested in me by local 12, maintenance workers and gym teachers union i'm declaring janitorial law.  help me drain them pipes.  if they freeze, the school will be closed for a full month.  : no.  we can't let that happen.   there's going to be much more snow and you're going to meet a tall, dark stranger.  if you don't mind i prefer an expert opinion.  announcer: now the weather update from meteorologist dr. jake.  there's going to be much more snow and you're going to meet a tall, dark stranger.  back to you, brenna.  mom, can we go home now.  brain's mom: no, our electricity's out.  want to know your college grades.  no.  haney: the way to be sure the pipes don't freeze would be for us to stay here all night.  that's the spirit.  thanks for volunteering.  what. no, i didn't mean...  i'm... i'm hungry.  i got plenty of beans for us all.  dr. jake: don't worry, there's a zeropercent chance of freezing rain.      mommy. daddy. the town is exploding.  and it's very pretty.  i tried all night, but the plow's stuck.  none of the roads can get plowed now.  daddy, look, it's too cold to write.  i have to stop doing my report.  yes, we still have power, oliver.  francine can work on her report here.  i'm going to pick up food.  i'll get enough for everyone.  reporter: power is out and food supplies are low.  is that all the milk, eggs and bread there are.  no deliveries can get through.  lucky for me, i got the last loaf.  first come, first servedsorry.  reporter:the storm shows no sign of stopping.  things will get worsebefore they get better.  why eat beans when we have all this food.  i wouldn't eat that junk if i was you.  besides, it's all froze.  haney: i... hate... school.  mr. haney.  he didn't mean it.  i want to go home.  : beans.  anthe kitchen light is broken.  nothing's brokenour electricity is out.  make it be fixed, daddy.  i can't, poochyface.  : very funny.  make it be fixed, daddy.  paysomeone.  money can't fix this, honeywallet.  mom. ready to go.  i'll be ready to go as soon as i finish the driveway, hon.    buster: hey.  you have heat at your house.  yeah. come on.  i never thought that walking could be one of the hardest things i ever did.  there's more coming.  mom invited anyone who needed to get warm.  i couldn't buy any food, but everyone brought what they had.  i'll mix it all up and make stew.  i have less ideas than ever for this dumb report.  our house was freezing.  i tried to practice the tuba and my lips got stuck tothe mouthpiece for two hours.   d.w.: we have no power.  this is the most horrible time of my whole life.  we'll all die in a heap.  thank you for that vote of confidence.  i can cook on the camp stove outside and in the fireplace.  oh, good, we won't starve.  we'll just freeze.  put on your coat and mittens and huddle by the fire.  and don't try to practice the tuba.  the radio says power's out everywhere.  should we check on the crosswires.  if you want, but i'm sure they found some way to keep warm that we can't even afford.    i'll get it.   hello.  no servants, no electric blanket.  the weather is so rude.  did you bring any of the eggs, bread and milk you bought.  uh, no, why.  no reason.  i'm sure we have enough stew for everyone.  hey, that looks just like yo when you showed up earlier.  wow, they must've been freezing.  no electricity, just fire for heat...  kind of like us.  how did they ever do it.  i don't think i ever could have survived as a pioneer.  they had to be tough to live like this every day of their lives and they didn't even know what tomorrow would bring.  they had no weathermen or anything.  the storm's going to end soon.  oh, give me a break.  hey, it stopped snowing.  we're not going to die in a heap.   yay.  it's time to dig out.  who wants to help.  francine: but i might know how they did it.  people working together can do stuff that no one of them could do alone like survive some tough times or start new countries and stuff.     i bet the pioneers were people like us.  we all still kind of need each other's help but just sort of forget it a lot of the time.  i'm finished.  if your power is out keep watching this station and we'll tell you when to expect it to be turned on again.  the power's back on.  mom: hold it, young lady.  no snowballs in the house.  but i want to freeze it.  why.  because this was the best day of my life and i want a piece of it.  okay, but put it on a plate so it doesn't stick to the freezer.  all: and now...  kid: it's snowing.  is there school.  mother: no schoolsnow day.  let's call sam.  that's elan.  my name's elan.  that is barry his younger brother.  and over there is sam.  my name is sam.  he lives right there.  today's a snow day.  since we can't go to school, we play.  kids: snowball fight.  this is how you build a perfect snowball: you pick up some snow in your hand...  pack it in your hands into a rounded shape.  basically like this.  it's got all the right stuff: it's pretty hard and it's the right size.  and we don't throw them in the face.  he caught my snowball.  it looks like jack wants to come and shovel with us.  we're a team of shovelers.  which is great, because the more people we have the quicker it will get done.  we're going to be sledding right now.  you drink hot cocoa on a cold day because...  you're cold and you want to be warmed up.  so when you drink the hotness, um...  it warms your body up.   yeah.  kids: and now, back to arthur.  dad, let's play.  there's no time for play.  we have a lot of work to do.  oh, uh... hi, mr. ratburn.  i'm looking for my dad.  very funny, arthur.  now, put down that ball and help me stuff turkeys for the crosswires' big party.  mom..  mom..  i went out to the garage to talk to dad. he's not there.  he was out there a minute ago.  hey.  watch where you're going.  what's going on.  whwhere's my family.  arthur ratburn, stop fooling around.   arthur: no.   what could be worse than dreaming that your teacher lives in your house.  ratburn: arthur, if you don't hurry d.w. and i will eat all the delicious blueberry waffles your dad made.  what you got is a ton of snow on your roof.  yes...  will the roof collapse.  nah, as soon the snow melts, i'll fix the cracks but this'll hold, no problem.  what a relief.  or... you may want to get this fixed right away.   saturdays with snow are the best.  ahh, just in time fordunce patrol.  well, duh.  duh.  well, duh.  arthur... oh, that show is so dumb.  mom, after a hard week at school it's fun to kick back, watch some dumb guys, and know i won't have to see or think about mr. ratburn all weekend.  that's what i wanted to tell youmr. ratburn's roof collapsed and he has nowhere to stay.  oh, that's too bad.  i knew you'd feel that way so we invited him to stay here.  mmhmm...  huh..   what. you... he... here. who. he stay...  . arthur's teacher's going to stay here.  .  he can't.  just until they fix his roof.  arthur: it's too weird.  my teacher in my house, walking around drinking from my cups and touching my stuff.  it's so wrongschool is at school and home is at home because they're not supposed to mix.  exactly.  my parents have to understand that.  how can you not understand.  it's wrong. it goes against nature.  the poor man has nowhere else to go.  are there no hotels.  he's going to stay here.  we're all going to make him feel welcome.   so, he's coming whether you like it or not, huh.  it'll be just like taking a test...  all the time.  quick, what's seven times eight..   this is your brain and this is your brain when you watch junky tv.   are you doing homework.  arthur: i'm taking a bath.  ratburn: i'm sliding a waterproof pad under the door.  write the names of the continents in order of size.    what you got there, son.  this.  oh... stuff.  why are you putting a poster over a poster.  you wouldn't understand.  is that to make your teacher think you're smart, not dopey.  go away.   d.w.: hey, look at me.  arthur, come say hello.  ratburn: i really can't tell you how much i appreciate this.  hey, hi, over here.  hello.  hi, i'm d.w. read arthur's smarter sister.  mr. ratbite, is it true what arthur says about you hating all children.  here i am.  welcome, come in, hello.  you're on my foot.  would you carry these to arthur's room.  my room.  . he's staying in your room. .  arthur, i put your sleeping bag in d.w.'s room.  you can sleep there.  no fair.  arthur: those are some of my most very favorite books.  spline extrusion...  the copernican universe model.  didn't you just borrow those from the brain.  i believe in using mybraina lot.  mr. ropeburn you should see what's under here.  no.  uh, i mean...   i think i smell dad making a cake.  cake.  did you say "cake".  whew.  buster: hey, arthur.  oh, man, am i glad to see you.  i can't come out.  why.  ishehere.  yeah.  i'll come down and let you in.  no. no... no, thanks.  i... no.  d.w.: he's not here.  there was no cake, arthur.  mr. rathead was very disappointed.    show narrator: today we watch grass grow in real time.  just watching some educational tvfascinating.  you look... different.  i don't always dress like i'm going to school.  so, the school roof fell in.  no, the roof to my home.  but you're a teacherthe schoolisyour home.  teachers don't live at school, d.w.  we have houses just like you.  the world seemed so simple before this moment.  i thought you might enjoy watching one of my videos.  oh, i'm sure it will be a very educational experience.   spooky poo.  spooky poo..  i haven't seen this since i was ten.   he watches cartoons.  ratburn: this is arthur's heaviest schoolbook.  shazam.  no homework tonight.  wow. can you teach me how to do that.  no problem.  arthur: shazam.  no homework tonight.  great, arthur.   morespooky poo.   you made cake.  for me.  arthur: i guess i was wrong about mr. ratburn.  teachers can be sort of almost normal.  who'd have thought it'd be so great.  good night, mom and dad.  parents: good night, arthur.  good night, mr. ratburn.  ratburn: good night, arthur.  good night, d.w..  d.w.: good night, mr. ragburp.  arthur: good night, pal.   good night, pal.  will there be more cake tomorrow.  i bet arthur's ready to run away from home.  here he comes.  my mom said you could stay at my house until ratburn goes home.  no, thanksit's not so bad.  he taught me a magic trick.  we had fun.  buster: i got a cminus on that test.  you beat me.  what'd you get, arthur.  he got an "a".  it's not fair.  what do you mean.  she means we can all get "a"s if we brought the teacher home and our fathers made special cakes for him.  i studied hard for that "a".  others: oh, yeah. sure.  we believe you, really.  that the teacher lives with you is just a coincidence.  i'm being sarcastic.  hey, buster.  want to come and watch somespooky poo.  it's funny.  no, i don't want to get between you and your new friend.  want to go to the sugar bowl for some hot cocoa.  no, we're going to the sugar bowl.  i'd like my books back.  sure, come on over and get them.  no, thanksbring them to school.  oh, fern asked me to give you this.  hey.  what's with everybody.  . teacher's pet, teacher's pet .  . something... something that rhymes with "pet". .  and that means you, arthur.   hey, boy.  some days it's so good to get home and just forget all about school.   hi.  mmm... hello, arth...  arthur.  "rat and rat junior".  none of my friends will come here and binky called me "teacher's pet." we should ask mr. ratburn to talk to them.  aah. no.  were you ever a kid..  that'd make it worse.  i'm sorry, i couldn't help but overhearbecause d.w. handed me this juice can and told me to listen.  you know i wouldn't give you special treatment.  but that's not what they think.  what can we do about what people think when they're wrong.  if you give me an "f" it'll prove i'm not the teacher's pet.  just act normally and they'll realize how wrong they are.  but not as soon as if he gave me an "f." teacher's pet, teacher's pet.  if cake gets you one "a" will pie a la mode get you an aplus.   i hope my mother appreciates this.  ratburn: arthur.  i won't be staying at your house anymore.  really..  i need to be closer to my house to supervise the work so i'll be at francine's.  then i'll be staying at binky's.  everyone's so generous.  who knows. i may spend time at muffy's and buster's and fern's...  mr. ratburn in my housedrinking from our cups, touching my stuff.  how could my parents do this to me.  what was it like.  what can i do.  first, if anyone calls you "teacher's pet" just smile and don't let it bother you.  second, i hope you likespooky poo.  you might want to knowthe secret formula for drawing arthur.  we'll do two letter o's, hook them together with a littleupsidedown letter u.  then we'll do a largerletter u like this.  we'll do a straight line here.  two dots here.  two lines here.  two dots here.  a curved line for his mouth.  i will add his ears.  and there's arthur.  that's great.  captioned bymedia access group at wgbh visit us online at pbskidsgo.org.  you can findarthurbooks and lots of other books, too, at your local library.   . what a wonderful kind of day .  . if we could learn to work and play .  . and get along with each other .  . you got to listen to your heart .  . listen to the beat .  . listen to the rhythm, the rhythm of the street .  . it's a simple message and it comes from the heart .  . believe in yourself .  . for that's the place to start .  . and i say hey. .  . hey. what a wonderful kind of day .  . if we could learn to work and play .  . and get alongwith each other .  . hey. .  chuck e. cheese'sproud supporter of pbs kids, who know for safe fun, you need to make this cool move...  ...before you can makethese cool moves.  pbs kids, where a kidcan be a kid.  and by a grant from the united statesdepartment of education through the corporationfor public broadcasting and by contributionsto your pbs station from: every week...  that's me.  martha speaks is proof positive...  do we love llamas, people.  ...there's nothing like a talking dog.  hello.   you guys are really irritating.  does "irritating" mean "fun".  on your mark, go.  martha speakson pbs kids.  wow.    )
