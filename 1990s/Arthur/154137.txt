"a stranger is just a friend you haven't met yet." what a ripoff.  it's not even a real fortune.  here, you can have it.  i'll take the next one.  okay.  who wants banana bread.   how can something as tiny as this mouse cause so much trouble.  why are people so afraid of them, anyway.  there are plenty of mice heroes like stuart little and despereaux, but i guess it's pretty different when one decides to move in with you.  okay, you can start 'er up again.       this kind of trap won't hurt the mouse.  it just catches him when he goes to eat the food inside.  then we'll let him go, somewhere far away from the house.  you mean far,far,away.  i don't want him moving back in with his mice family and his mice friends.  don't worry, d.w.  he'll be gone before you know it.  he better be.          arthur: we've tried every kind of mousetrap there is.  it just eats the food and escapes.  i think it may actually enjoy the challenge.  i wish i could help.  we never have mice.  how come.  i don't know.  probably because they're afraid of nemo.  good little kitty.   now go find that mouse and eat it.  hopefully he'll just scare it away.  d.w.: i don't care what he does.  i just want that mouse gone.  pal: kate.  we've been infested.  there's a filthy scavenger in the house.  that tiny mouse isn't so bad.  not him.  nemo.  he's downstairs right now.  what if he's moving in.  my couch will be covered in cat hair.  i'll have to rebury all my bones.  oh, the indignity.  i'm sure it's just for a few days.  nemo: or a few weeks.  a year at most.  it depends on how long the job takes.  oh, is this my new litter box.  back, fiend.  those are d.w.'s toys.  what do you mean by "job".  i'm here to take care of your mouse problem.  but don't worry, they've hired the best.  i don't like to brag, but i'm a blackbelt in katfu, master of the "iron claw" style and "pouncing mantis."   we're going to be stuck with him forever.  nemo: hello.  anyone home.  squeak, squeak.  what.  not even one dead bug in there.   well, they must have an open can of tuna somewhere.      it was huge.  i don't think it was a mouse at all.  perhaps a deformed rabbit or a wild boar.  it had fangs down to here.  do you think it was the gabbernook.  oh, no.  anything but that.  yes, yes, that's exactly what it was.  you'll need a lion to get rid of it.  uh, what exactly is a gabbernook.  something kate just made up.   pal : oh, it's too good.  very funny.  but until that creature is gone, i'll probably be staying here.  hmm, perhaps i'll sleep in the crib tonight.  i hope you're a heavy sleeper.  i cough up fur balls at night.    i guess we're just going to have to handle this ourselves.  i can't believe i have to sacrifice a perfectly good piece of salami for this.  now what.  when everyone's asleep, we set the trap.  then... we wait.    hey.  stop copying my evil laugh.  nemo: big family...  15 brothers and sisters.  and, being the runt of the litter, i was always getting left behind.  "where's nemo." oh, please, make it stop.   there he is.  now.   we did it.  oh, odious lump.  vile spawn.    pal: and then, it appeared...  in a puff of sulphurous smoke.  right behind us.  it must have used magic.  maybe it really is a gabbernook.  it's the only explanation.  well, i think mom and dad are trying something different.  there was an important meeting at breakfast.  so the exterminator is coming today and he's going to take care of the mouse.  i don't want him to "take care of" the mouse.  i want him to get rid of it.  he will.  d.w.: oh.  but how.  we've tried everything.  um, well, he...  he has a special potion that he sprays the mouse with.  and the mouse goes to sleep.  forever.  great.  when does he get here.  the sooner, the better, i say.  you've got to be kidding me.   hey, guess what.  today you get to meet one of my best, smartest, funniest friends.  he can do tricks and...  that's great, but right now i have to find nemo and bring him back to francine.  i can help you look for him.  i'm great at finding cats.  once i found this cat that was lost for seven weeks.  see, i had this tuna fish sandwich in my pocket but i didn't know it, 'cause my jacket smelled funny anyway...  nemo, come out.  if the gabbernook can appear anywhere, what makes you think you'll be safe in there.  nemo: i don't know.  perhaps it will think i'm just a slipper.  if you don't come out, i'm going to hide your catnip.   see.  i told you.  there's nothing to be afraid of.  rat: i beg your pardon, sir, but where can a thirsty rat fetch a drop of water.    that was easy.  it's changed shape.  and color.  oh, what do you want with us, o spectral gabbernook..  gabbernook, eh.  can't say i know what that is.  mind you, i'm new to these parts.  general bucephalus calpurnia higgins at your service.  you're not... that mouse that's been pestering us.  well, certainly not.  i am a white rat, rattus norvegicus, and i am the proud pet of ladonna compson.  pleased to meet you, general.  and i you, madam.  now, what's all this about a mouse.  would you like me to have a talk with him.  and now, introducing the smartest, cutest albino rat this side of the mississippigeneral higgins.  hey, where'd he go.  it's time to move on, my boy.  there's a house not far from here owned by a mr. ratburn.  i hear he has some very nice cheese.  : any camembert.  most certainly.    ah, to be a young scamp, roaming from house to house.   it's gotten bigger from eating all our food.  whoa, whoa, careful.  that's general higgins.  who.  my pet rat.  why do you have a pet rat.  you taught him that.  that's amazing.  i also taught him how to play basketball with a pingpong ball.  he's got a pretty mean dunk.  and he sleeps in his own little hammock.   arthur: that's probably the exterminator.  i should get nemo home to francine.  come on, general.  we don't want to be here when they start spraying.  till we meet again, my canine companion and feline friend.  i look forward to it.  nemo: oh, yes. can't wait.  can someone please take me home now.  i bet i've lost eight of my lives on this trip.  can i play with him again sometime.  whenever you want.  dad.  the exterminator's here.    and now...  i am supposed to jump through a flaming hoop.  why are they making me do this.  girl: we were writing about an animal's point of view.  "point of view" means what the animals think.  i almost got hit with the fire.  i'm glad that's over.  i am a lion.  there are these giants that are trying to capture me with traps.  then when i come out, it is like a dream.  there are little pieces of crumbs everywhere.  my mouse is a lot like the mouse that pal and nemo were trying to get rid of.  i am in a cage.  i look out the window and i see a beautiful tree.  i should be flying outside.  i am a bird.  we're trying to act like we are in the animal's mind.  i tried to swim away from the big black shadow, but the person caught me.  he picked me up with this big white thing that is made out of string.  i am a fish.  one day, i snuck out of the gate and wandered off to a big grassland full of children.  suddenly, big arms reached down and grabbed me.  i jumped out of his arms and ran home.  i am a chihuua  there is so much water.  there is a rock that i sometimes sleep on.  there are little pieces of lettuce that fall in my bowl.  i am a turtle.  we wanted to tell how an animal would feel.  we have feelings and they might have feelings too.  then i climbed up on a rock.  i slipped off and i just started falling and sliding.  i am a penguin.  i am about to go in the trash can and eat the moldy and dirty food.  i am a raccoon.   suddenly i see my owner with this thing in his hand.  above, this sticky stuff came flying at me.  i don't want to do that again.  i am a dog.  one day, i climbed up a tree so those humans couldn't pull my tail.  it is safe up here, because they can't climb trees like me.  i am a cat.  girl: you should write stuff because you can use your imagination and make your own stories.  and now...  arthur: hey, 25 cents.  someone must have dropped it.  well, it's mine now.  or is it.  someone else had this quarter before me, and i'll probably pass it on to another person.  like your sister.  i just remembered you owe me ten cents from two years ago.  i don't have any change.  but this should cover the interest you owe me.  and this sweater.  my grandma gave it to me.  but i bet d.w. will get it when i grow out of it.  and kate will get it after her.  no way.  we're never going to wear that.  it's way too arthury.  if you think about it, who reallyownsanything.  check out that kite.  it's beautiful.   golf is all about control.  you have to hitthe ball just right.  and, um, that's an example of how not to do it.  you should be taking notes.  gotcha.  hey.  muffy: binky.  you shouldn't have moved my ball.  now it's out of play.  well, your ball scared away my monarch butterfly.  ladonna: keep it down.  i'm trying to read.  in a tree.  why not.  it's shady and quiet.  unless there's a golfer and a butterfly catcher chinwagging by the roots.  look.  it's a bullfighter's cape stuck in a tree.  that's not a bullfighter's cape.  it's just a kite.  here, give me that golf club.  it's not a club.  it's a putter.   almost.  there.  now we can go on a quest to find the owner, fight off dragons and spies, and collect a big reward.  i'm not really dressed for a quest.  can't we just skip to the reward part.  come on, guys.  where's your sense of adventure.  okay, we get it.  where are you going.  no one's going to see the kite on the ground.  we have to fly it so the owner can find it.  on your mark...  get set...  go.  faster, muffy.  faster.  i was made to run companies, not races.  whoohoo.  ladies and gentlemen, we have liftoff.  it sure flies well.  i call next turn.  press one and tell bailey our golf lesson is over.  and ask him to bring over the sandwiches.     you know, i haven't flown a kite in years.  i forgot how much fun it is.  ladonna: that's not just any old kite.  back home, we called kites that fly like that "majestic windeaters." you just made that up, didn't you.  uh, kind of.  what do we do with it.  the owner never came back.  finders keepers, i guess.  yep.  and since i was the first one who saw it...  wait a sec.  none of this would have happened if i hadn't hit my ball over here.  well, i was the one who got it down from the tree.  withmygolf club.  guys, guys, come on.  there's no reason to fight.  there's a simple, mature solution to this.  i'll keep the kite.  both: no way.  okay, okay, then let's just share it.  we'll each take it for a week and then switch off.  a timeshare is a great idea.  i'll have daddy's lawyer draw up a contract.  thank you, walter.  it's exactly what we talked about, just written in a way no one can understand.  sign by the x.  so who gets to have the kite first.  longest straw goes first, middle goes second, shortest goes last.  whoohoo.  yes.  binky beats them all.  he came, he saw, he picked the longest straw.  see you later, gators.  : i've got a kite to fly, i've got a kite to fly.    i'm sure it'll be sunny tomorrow.  wear your snorkel this week because it's rain, rain, rain.  huh.  don't worry.  this guy never gets it right.   curse you, weatherman.   curse you, weatherman.    ready.  ready.  you're doing something wrong.  i'm just letting it go, like you told me.  well, then why isn't it flying.  i don't know.  maybe because there's no wind.   i hate to interrupt, but according to my calendar, your kite time is officially up.  but... i didn't even get to fly it once.  can't i have one more day.  sorry, a deal's a deal.  unless...  just name it.  i'll give you anything.  thanks again, walter.  so, this rider to the contract will trade you one of my kiteflying days for two of yours when your turn comes around again.  yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.  where do i sign.  please, please, please, let there be a breeze.   no....   maybe you'll have better luck in, let's see...  16 days from now.    hi, chip.  did you make the jv badminton team.  no way.  and we even donated a swimming pool to that school.  i'm going to tell daddy we shoultake iback.  me.  actually, i'm flying this amazing kite we found.  hold on.  i'll take a picture and send it to you.   oh, no.  it's flying away.  bailey, quick, do something.        oh, well.  thanks for trying, bailey.   looks like the kite's gone for good.  i wonder what binky and ladonna will say.  you're in breach of contract...  whatever that means.  i'm going to sue your pigtails off.  i thought you were my friend.  but friends don't just lose majestic windeaters.   i want to go back to louisiana.  i don't know, but it isn't going to be pretty.  maybe i don't have to tell them.  uhoh.  i know that look.  you're up to something.  me.  of course not.  i just have a little shopping to do.  hi, bailey.  when you get down from the mountain could you pick me up at the sugar bowl.   you better stay close by, bailey.  i may need help consoling ladonna when i tell her that i lost the...   the kite.  i don't believe it.  it's a miracle.  and just on the day when i thought that...  what are you doing over here.  i thought we were supposed to meet by the tree.  hey, you shouldn't fly it by these bushes.  it could get torn.  don't worry, majestic windeater.  i'm going to take really good care of you.  well, see you in a week.  i hope you had fun.  oh, yeah.  it was a blast.   i'll show you guys some tricks.  i call this the compson camel twist.  and this one is the louisiana loopdiloop.  what are you doing here.  it's my turn.  but i get two days off your week, remember.  binky asked me for an extra day.  can i have one, too.  i didn't get to fly it at all.  it just came back from the repair shop.  the repair shop.  um, yeah.  but it's all fixed up now.  you broke the kite.  that means you owe each of us three days.  didn't you read your contract.  there is nothing in here that says when i have to give back your two days.  the kite was broken.  now it's fixed.  show me where it says...  here, in paragraph four, subheading a...  n't care.  you can have your days back in december.  what. that's not fair.   quiet. you're making too much noise.  it's hurting my ears.  this is my kite.  i lost it 22 days ago, on saturday at 11:15 in the morning.  it has a scar on it, but that's okay.  i'm going to go fly it now.  well, i guess we found the owner.  it's gone for good now.  and we could have all been flying it right now, instead of arguing.  if you want, you can fly the kite with me, but you have to be quiet and i get to go first.  i've flown this kite 205 times and i never get tired of flying it.  i don't like to do too many fancy moves.  just hold on tight and let the wind take it everywhere.  whicharthurcharacter are you.  she's like
