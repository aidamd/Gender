 ""he  hey. what a wonderful kind of day.   hey.  arthur: hey, d.w.  hey.  whoa.   hello.  today, as a special treat my esteemed colleague, professor baxter is going to speak to us about a subject he knows all about.   thank you.  today we will discuss...  roll the tape, please.  sleep.  sleep is the most necessary part of our lives.  it replenishes our strength so that we are physically fit.   it rests our brains so that we are mentally fit.  mr. ratburn : this animal belongs to the genussus scrofa.  can anyone tell me the sound animals of this genus make.   mr. ratburn: excellent, buster.  thats indeed the sound ofsus scrofa,the wild boar.  and finally, it saves our energy for the truly important things in life.   now i can prepare myself for something truly important.     thank you, professor.  come back next week, when professor baxter will present part two of his sleeping lecture series: eating after sleeping.  hey.  tv narrator: for apollo astronaut neil strongarm, landing on the moon was not only the dream of a lifetime. it was his destiny.  adventures in spacewill continue, right after this.  arthur: hey do you ever wonder what your destiny is.  nope, i know it: i'll win a gold medal on the olympic hockey team.  i'll discover the origin of the universe.  i'm going to end world hunger...  after my career as the world's most glamorous fashion designer.  all: ah.  well, i think we all know what buster's destiny is...  all: mattress tester.  woman :..  the most magical kingdom of all...  man : pizza paula's pizzaland.  the first theme park made entirely of food.  chorus :  come to a heavenly place    where cheese and tomato and thickorthincrust dough    are all that the eye can see.   pepperoni, please.  woman : as a special pizzaland grand opening event the first annual pizza paula pizza pigout.  the contestant who can eat the most pizzas will receive a lifetime pass to any one of my many pizza restaurants.  but, mom, you always tell me to do the things i'm good at and i'm excellent at allyoucaneat contests.  francine said it's my destiny.  that or mattress tester.  i'm sorry, buster, but that park is miles away which means we'd have to stay in a hotel.  we don't have the money for that now.  money...  hmm...      will this help pay for a hotel.  oh, buster, it's wonderful that you're working so hard for...  my destiny.  i know, but i'm sorry.  a hotel costs a lot...   i don't think this is how destiny is supposed to work.  yes, this is bitzi baxter.  yes, i'm the editor of theelwood city times.  what, mom.  what.  arthur: this is so cool that you could invite us all to pizzaland.  well, since pizzaland asked my mom to cover the grand opening and gave her a free suite at their hotel i figured we shouldn't waste it.  what luck.  it's not luck.  it's destiny.  paula : welcome to my pizzaland.  just step on the welcome mat and come on in.  mmm.  abbondanza.  it's...  paradise.  all: wow.  mmm, crust.  deepdish.  buster please don't eat the sidewalk.  okay, everybody, here are your maps.  let's meet back here at 4:00 sharp.  you want to go to the anchovy flume.  there's something i have to do first.  buster: i'd like to register for tomorrow's contest, please.   sorry, guys.  it's my special talent.   muffy: you're going to bed at 6:00.  i need my rest for the contest tomorrow.  but you'll miss the laser show at the river of extra cheese.  buster's being smart.  the better rested, the better he'll eat.  let's give him peace and quiet.  as if a marching band could keep him awake.  francine: it's just an excuse for him to nap.  oh.  almost forgot my exercises.  and bite chew, chew...  and swallow.   okay, that's enough.   pizza pigout...    wow, that was deep.  i can't sleep.  ...and every time i shut my eyes i think about the pizza contest.  i see the pizza, i taste the pizza, i smell it.  i mean, look.  it's probably because you tried to go to bed so early.  yeah, that must be it.  why don't you try my mask and earplugs.   okay, well... here goes.  good night.       d.w.: here you go, arthur.  you just eat breakfast while i clean your room.  is there anything else you'd like me to do for you.  oh, goody.  let me see.  first is seven hours, 34 minutes and 20 seconds to go.  what.  seven hours, 34 minutes...  buster:..and ten seconds to go.  seven hours, 34 minutes and zero seconds to go.  d.w., don't go.   come on, buster.  buster, sleep.  i can't.  brain: i've got it.  buster, look over here.  now, just think of math class...    buster: nope.  i dreamt i heard the lunch bell.  harder, harder.  feel the burn.  good.  now are you tired.  nope.  i'm hungry.  i can't believe i'm doing this for you, buster but a proper bed is the only way to get a good night's sleep.  good night, buster.  good night.   okay, out.  out.  you know, it always helps me to punch my pillow a few times.  does that make you sleepy.  no, but it makes my hand hurt so i think about that instead of how i can't sleep.  oh.  francine: hey, arthur you haven't come up with any ideas yet.  oh, well, uh...  i don't know... counting sheep.   that is such a lame old trick.  it never works.  i... muffy: shh.   after i destroy all my crazy bus stuff i'll start on mary moo cow.  buster: arthur.  arthur...  buster, no.  you fell asleep.  you counted sheep.  i know, but then i started dreaming about shepherds which made me think about shepherd's pie which made me think about pizza pie...  buster, stop it already.  it's just a stupid contest.  it's not just a contest.  it's my destiny.  you've got to help me.  oh, what's the use.  it's hopeless.  well, there's only one thing to do when destiny bites the dust.  bite back.   hello, room service, could i have a pizza.  man : room service is closed for the night.  perhaps you can come down to the kitchen to get something.  chef: what are you doing just standing there.  we've only got six hours, 15 minutes and 40 seconds until the contest.  here, twirl this.  i just wanted a snack. i couldn't sleep.  contestant: tell me about it.  what are you guys doing here.  we couldn't sleep.  this always happens to me.  i blew the rhubarb rita pieeating contest of '93 the barbecue brenda rib jamboree of 2000.  i haven't had a good night's sleep in 16 years.  wait a minute.  wait.  how can you be so crazy about a silly contest.  it's not a silly contest.  it's my destiny.  but there are always contestsif not this one, there'll be another one.  that's right... there'll always be another one.  cone onhelp us with this work.  work..   right, work.  uh... will you excuse me a moment.    announcer : welcome to the pizza pigout.   pizza paula would like to make an apology.  due to her incredible excitement about today's pigout she didn't sleep a wink last night so the contest is postponed until tomorrow.  that gives all you contestants a chance to get another good night's rest.  aw.  pizza, anyone.   guys.  guys...  kids:..  hi, my name is adajee.   everybody in my class has a different way to help them get to sleep.  girl: what helps me fall asleep is i do cat's cradle with a string.  i listen to music to make me go to sleep.  it's nice and calming.      girl: what helps me fall asleep is i stare at the wall.  then my eyes get tired, and i just fall asleep.  but i take my glasses off.  boy: what i do to fall asleep is i just think of good things till 10:00 so i don't wake up at 4:28 in the morning.  i think of what play dates i'm going to have. what things i'm going to eat. am i going to have a good day.  the thing that helps me fall asleep is my dad sings me yiddish songs.   the thing that helps me fall asleep is that i think of a dream.  it's an illusion that comes from your mind when you sleep.  i think of a dream before i fall asleep.  then i'm able to have that dream.  i'm dreaming of somebody in an ice cube.  that's what i do to help me sleep.  see. they're all sleeping.   and now...  dad: okay, "connect piece a15 to b20.  "then connect the piece marked 'right corner facing main'..." never underestimate the importance of directions.  imagine if they didn't follow instructions when buildinthe eiff tower.  see. i told you.  we were supposed to connect piecezquinze tocsoixantesept.  if you listened to me, this wouldn't have happened.  even repairmen need to look at instructions.  don't you want to look at the instruction manual.  don't need it.  this machine's as good as new.   following instructions is boring.  look, i made this and never looked at the instructions once.  dad and arthur:.  see. who needs instructions.   no can do, francine.  my mom said it'll be bad for my asthma.  i don't think soit would make pal feel uncomfortable.  mom just reupholstered the couches and doesn't want them all ripped up.  great...  now what am i going to do.  nemo, i'm sorry you can't come camping with me this weekend.  and i can't find anyone to watch youi've tried everybody.  boy: i tell you, binky there's no better pet than a dog.   look at that scaredycat.  crusher could eat him for lunch.  he could eat him for breakfast.  i bet he could eat him for an afternoon snack.  on a cracker.   why don't you take your dog and get lost.  sorry, nemo, but i still have to find someone to watch you.  if i don't, we'll have to put you in... the kitty kennel.   francine, sorry i teased your cat.  i
