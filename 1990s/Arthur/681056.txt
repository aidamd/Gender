hospital after it was born.  when he first came home i was thinking that he would be nice, and he is and i was excited.  my dad said that he looks just like me.  i help with my brother by feeding it.  i help push him in the carriage.  julie: i help take care of my brother by dressing him playing with him and trying to keep him out of trouble.  my mom had to change his diapers and i had to watch.  i never change his diaper.  sometimes i change his diaper.   what's most important is to love the baby whether it's a girl or boy.  and now...  ready.  okay.  this is a video of my first birthdaybefore

her.  then she'd think i'm not a baby expert.  everyone, calm down.  i know what to do.  you hold her while i get a clean diaper.  come on, kate.    i wonder what she's trying to tell us.    both: aw.  is everything okay.  huh.  it is now.  arthur burped the baby right when she was about to explode.    i loosen up the gas, and he takes the credit.  arthur wasn't trying to make you look bad.  burps are mysterious things.  d.w.: one burp and he takes over.  i should be doing that.  she's my sister.  dad: it would fit right here.  huh. what would fit.  the cribkate will be sleeping in here with you.  she will..  maybe you make her burp, arthur but she's going to live in my room.    d.w.: a little to the left.  easy does it.  mom, your end's crooked.  we're going to have so much fun.     p.u.. it smells like a zoo in here.  close thatkate will be in a draft.  ew, my doll smells like stinky diapers.    you want to play, too.  you can have my truck.  watch out, the tire kind of falls off.  d.w., kate can't play with your truck.  why not.  it has too many small pieces she can choke on.  you have to be extra careful.  this room has to be babysafe.  we have to clean up everything.    what a good girl you are.  eat your cereal, d.w.  i can't eatmy teeth are tired.  why don't you just get rid of her.  i can'tmommy and daddy like her.  what if they didn't like her anymore.  yeah, what if she did bad things.  she doesn't do anything, except eat and cry and poop.  humming and whistling casually) she doesn't have to do anything. she just has to get blamed for it.   she did it.  a demolition team did it.  yeah... that's what i meant.   : how did my new shoes get in the dishwasher..  kate did it. i saw her.  go to your room and think about what you said.  i'll be up to discuss it.  he said "discuss." you know what that means.  i'm in trouble.  i wonder what he'll say when he finds baloney in the c.d. player.  i told you not to do that.  what are you thinking.  about our garage sale tomorrow.  d.w.: mrs. tibble, we have a nice, brandnew baby, hardly used50 cents.  tibble: what.  my mommy says she's too much trouble.  okay, 35 cents, but it's my final offer.  narrator
