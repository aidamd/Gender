 : wow...  the ultimate chocolate sundae.   or like the brain and science.   but i can't go to bed now.  i'm on the verge of discovering a new galaxy.   or like binky and...  hey, do you even have a favorite thing.  i don't know.  ow.   it's coming.  it's coming.    it's here.  it's here.   giant bugs in school can only mean one thing.  a massive radiation leakage in the cafeteria.  no.  ratburn: it's bug week.  elwood city's annual festival of sixlegged things that crawl, sting, bite and make life ohsopleasant.  now, remember, over the next few days each of you will make a presentation on the bug, or buglike creature of your choice.  any questions.  students: no.  good.  it's getting hot in here.  arthur: then, when the spiderplayed by mehas the helpless fly wrapped up in silk, it sinks its fangs...  muffy: yuck.  arthur, i don't want to hear about this before dinner.  me neitheri'm playing the fly.  you guys better watch out for me.  i'm playing a honey bee, and they pack a sting.  sorry, i'm doing beesqueen bees.  okay, i'll be a termite, then i can really bring down the house.  i'm doing termites.  then what about those things with a gazillion legs.  a centipede.  no, the other one.  a millipede.  yeah, that's it.  sorry, binky, that's my project.  oh, man, all the good bugs are taken.  muffy: ...here the honeybee workers feed what is called "royal jelly" to the future queen bees.  and what would royal jelly be without a little royal peanut butter, hmm.   hmph.  just what i'd expect from a class full of drones.  boy: now the stink bugs will demonstrate...  : their most unusual method of defense.  kids : eww. yuck.  ratburn: george, did you bring enough clothespins for everybody.  uh... well... no.   ratburn: in an orderly fashion please, single file.  is that your bug week project.  yes, i'm showing how the praying mantis inspired an effective fighting style.  want a demonstration.  : no, i believe you.  so do you have a bug for your report yet.  no, i wanted fleas, but molly has them.  how about butterflies.  nobody's picked them yet.  : butterflies.  they're for girls.  i was just trying to help.  some help.  giving me a girls' bug.  man, look at all the neat colors.  butterflies come from creepylooking worms.  cool.   gotcha.  huh.  wow...   they seem to prefer your lunch meat to mine.  that's because mine is pate de fois gras.   is it halloween already.  : big... blue... butterfly.  which way'd he go.  binky barnes.  chasing butterflies.  tell me.  you can't get away from me.  binky, are you up there.  i found some bugs good for boys if you still need them.  he's not here.  he's out hunting.  hunting.  yeah, butterflies.  he's gone butterflycrazy.  he wants to collect every one he sees.  especially a big, blue, hardtocatch one.  he's been chasing it for days.  it knows i can't leave school.  it's mocking me.  now that we know the eating habits of termites, let's meet a real live colony.  i don't see anything.  they're inside, working.  can you...  wrap it up, buster.  any second now, really.  i think i hear them coming.   thenwhap.  a great big hand came down and squashed me.  and so ended my exciting life as a bloodsucking mosquito.    don't expect all homework to be this much fun.  fun.  who has time for fun.  my prize catch is still out there.  binky, are you in there.  hey, close the flap quick.  don't let them out.   neat collection, huh.  monarchs, swallowtails, viceroysi got them all.  i've never had a real cool hobby before and i owe it all to you.  binky, those butterflies can't last in here.  they'll die.  relaxit's only for one more day.  oh, good.  you'll free them after you finish your project.  no way.  i'll move them into a bigger tent.  well, back to the hunt.  my collection is nothing without him.  oh, he's clever but he's going to make a mistake and i'll be ready.  binky, stop.  you're hunting that poor butterfly like captain ahab hunted moby dick.  you don't expect me to read that.  besides, i'm nothing like captain ahab.  moby dick was a fish.  a whale.  i mean, you're going too far, binky.  no, i'm not.  i've worked hard to catch the big blue butterfly.  he's mine. mine.  well, see ya.  what have i created.   he even looks like captain ahab.  brain, what are we going to do about binky.  how am i ever going to prove that millipedes don't really have a thousand legs if you keep interrupting me.   one, two, three...  what happened to you.  buster got mad.  he said he was tired of being a free meal.  arthur, did you get a chance to talk to binky.  he won't listen.  he's busy chasing that butterfly.  he's like...  both: captain ahab inmoby dick.  isn't it possible you two are simply overreacting.  thar she goes.   blue...  butterfly... seen it.  that.  don't kid around.  that's just a moth.  whoa.  sue ellen, i got it.  i got big blue.  it's so pretty.  i'll say.  well, me and big blue are going to the museum.  the museum. why.  i'm going to offer my collection to them so everyone can enjoy it.  wait up.  i bet they've got a real cool place for their butterflies to live.   they're not moving...  what did you expect.  haven't you ever seen a real collection before.  no.   : no.  binky: don't look at me like that.  what do you want me to do.  if i let you go, i'll fail.  i worked really hard on this.  then when it's ready to eat the poor, helpless fly the spider moves in, fangs ready...    oh, how cute.  thanks a lot, kate.  i was supposed to have the most frightening rert in the class.  ratburn: you're the last to go, binky.  you do have a project, don't you.  sure i do.  but can i do it outside.  binky: i wanted everyone to enjoy my extra cool butterfly collection and this is the best way to really see it.   that was really neat.  i didn't think you'd let them go.  very impressive work, binky.  i look forward to reading the written report.  oh, i knew i forgot something.  kids: and now...  we're studying endangered species like the american burying beetle.  it's a beetle.  a burying beetle.  a endangered beetle.  american burying beetle.  it's really cool.  i'm a zoo keeper at the roger williams park zoo.  we breed beetles at the zoo.  they're fascinating creatures.  boy: it finds a dead animal and brings it down in the dirt.  girl: it buries dead animals.  zoo keeper: the female lays her eggs near the carcass and the young larvae will feed off of the carcass.  we're making our own burying beetles.  we use papiermache.  boy: and then we had to wait two days so it could dry.  and then we painted it.  and this beetle is endangeredthey're dying out.  it's dying out.  there are some left, but once those few beetles are gone then there's no more.  i feel sad.  zoo keeper: we're working to bring back the american burying beetle.  boy: in this world we need all the creatures.  and now...  francine frensky can do a lot of things well.   she can hit farther than anyone i know...  and she can argue better than anyone i know.  i know i'm right and if i were wrong i'd admit it but i'm never wrong.  you're messing with the wrong person.  if you think you can...  okay, okay, you win.  a tomato is not a vegetable.  it's a fruit.  but today she wants to do something i don't think even she should try.  well, here i go.  i'm going to fly.  aren't you going to tell her.  youtell her.  she'll hurt herself.  i guess it's for her own good.  francine, stop it.  you're going to get hurt.  kids can't fly.  they can't.  no. it's impossible.  oh.   don't you hate it when you have to burst someone's bubble.  ratburn: i know you're concentrating on the talent show so i'm giving you extra homework so you don't forget what's important.   buster: i've got new jokes for the talent show.  what's orange and sounds like a parrot.  give up. a carrot.  humorous.  arthur: hey, francine what will you do for the talent show.  i'm not telling.  you'll have to be surprised.  what will you do, arthur.  arthur: i've been practicing tricks with pal.  pal, sit.  good boy.  pal, shake your...   uh, tail.  good boy.  oh, brother.  we're not quite ready yet, but pal's smart.  what about you, brain.  i am correcto, the human calculator.  the audience will shout out math problems and i'll do them instantly in my head.  what if ratburn asks a question.  i never thought of that.  if a train carrying 1,873 scoops of ice cream leaves chicago at 7:00 a.m.  and the freezer stops working how fast would it have to travel to reach new york before half the ice cream melts factoring in a melting rate of six scoops per minute.  maybe i should juggle.   what is that.  it's coming from that direction.  you know what it could be.  i saw an ad for an exterminator who uses sound to get rid of termites.     there's a rhythm to that noiselike an engine.   it'd have to be one gigantic engine.    whatever it is, it's coming from francine's roof.     francine: hey. no fair.  this was supposed to be a surprise.  oh, well, uh, we're surprised.  i didn't want you to hear me until the talent show but what do you think.  you haven't heard it all.  i'll start over.  i have to type up the rors i found in the encyclopedia.  i have to clean my room and wash the dog.  i have to dry his dog.   all: aah.  so, what do we do now.  get another shake.  what do we do about francine.  we have to tell her how awful she sounds before the talent show.  we do.  she'll get booed off the stage.  we shouldn't say anything.  it's not nice to tell someone they're awful.  what if they really are awful.  it's not polite, and you might hurt her feelings.  don't you want to order more shakes.  we've got to do something.  don't we.  i have to tell francine.  i bet she'll thank me.  who am i kidding.  this is francine.  what if brain's right and i hurt her feelings.   you don't believe in me.  i'm a failure.   group: how could you have been so cruel.   oh, no.  what have i done.  what if i'm wrong.  francine: thanks for telling me how bad my song was, arthur.  i'm glad i didn't go to the talent show.   hey... that sounds like you.   what a fantastic song.  it's breaking all sales records in every country around the world.  that could have been me.  i could have been famous.   guess i was wrong.   it could happen.  brain: you were right, arthur.  we've got to convince francine to quit the talent show.  i'm not so sure anymore.  i mean, what if we're wrong.  maybe francine's music could be the next big thing and sell millions.  let's ask muffy if she likes francine's song.  she knows what's popular.  but muffy wouldn't say anything bad about francine.  there's got to be a way for muffy to hear the song without knowing it's francine.  :  yeah, yeah, yeah    oh, i can, i can fly    yeah, you can fly    oh, yeah    yeah, yeah, yeah      huh.  francine:  you can fly.   what in the world is that.  turn it off.  so it's bad, right.  the worst.  that's francine practicing for the talent show.  francine's usually a great drummer.  how come she sounds so... bad.  her bad singing must be affecting her normally good drumming.  if that's true, then she doesn't have to quit the talent show.  e just has to stop singing.  how do we tell her.  i mean, it's francine.  i'm her best friend, i'll tell her.  she wouldn't believe me.  she said i was jealous.  why don't you try, arthur.  if two people say it, she'll believe it.  if three people tell her she has to believe it.  four's a good strong number.  how could she not believe four people.  she'll have to believe it when everyone boos and holds their ears.  poor francine.  she's herefrancine's here.  it worked.  she thought about it and she knows we're right.  one of you dropped this in my hall.  i've never heard anything so awful in my life.  what is it.  oh, that.  it's...  what is that, exactly.  well, francine, it's...  it's an audio cassette.  muffy, what's it a tape of.  it sounds like an elephant crushing ratburn's car.  um, i, uh...  it's you, francine.  we recorded you while you were drumming and singing.  what kind of friends are you.  why didn't anyone tell me i sounded so bad.  we all told you.  oh... yeah, i guess you did.  your drumming always sounds great when you aren't singing.  singing is just as important to me as drumming.  you know, you're a really good drummer.  maybe i'm not ready to do two things at once yet.  i agree. exactly.  you're right.  i guess i should only do one.  thanks for warning me.  i better practice.  the talent show's tomorrow.  i can see all.  i see into the mind of mr. ratburn.  he's thinking about... yes.  he's thinking about giving a lot of homework.  absolutely supernatural.  i don't know how she does it.  our next contestant will be francine frensky.  arthur: i feel so much better knowing that francine's going to play the drums and not sing.  i hope she's thankful.   arthur: no drums.  oh, no, she got it backwards.  i can't look.  i don't want to hear this.    :  you can fly...   :  if you try   :  you can fly if you try...    she's good.  she's really good.  she's exceedingly good.  i knew she was good all along.  you guys were trying to convince me i was wrong.   you can do most anything    even learn how to sing    flap your wings.        you can fly...    you can fly.   i would have been so embarrassed if you guys had let me singandplay the drums.  ah, it was nothing.  arthur: if you can sing and play the drums so well how come when you did them both at the same time it sounded so... different.  you mean, bad.  well... um...  guess i need more practice.  i knew you'd be great.  i bet you win, francine.  ratburn: and the winner is...  george.   arthur: george again.  he always wins.  you should have won, francine.  i'll keep drumming and singing, then next time i'll win.  maybe you should sing, play drums and hop on a pogo stick.  :  i can fly...   i guess she sounds alittlebetter.  you really like it, muffy.  hmm.  you say something.   hi, everyone, it's me, buster.  we always have something to dance about in elwood city, but you won't believe all the cool dances people are doing all around the country.
