you got to listen to your heart, listen to the beat    listen to the rhythm, the rhythm of the street    open up your eyes, open up your ears    get together and make things better    by working together    it's a simple message, and it comes from the heart    believe in yourself, for that's the place to start    and i say hey   hey.   what a wonderful kind of day    if we could learn to work and play    and get along with each other   hey.   what a wonderful kind of day   hey.   what a wonderful kind of day   hey.  hey, d.w..  hey.  whoa...  mom: arthur...   arthur, you heard me.  to bed.  mom.  just one more game.  now.  you can stay up later when you're older.   why do grownups get to make the rules.  sometimes i wonder what it would be like if kids were in charge.  mom, dad, time for bed.  aw....  please.  we want to watch the president.  mom: he's going to make a speech on the economy.  please, arthur. please.  you heard me.  tomorrow's an office day.  now, scoot, the both of you.  see.  there's no reason younger people shouldn't be in charge.  d.w.: arthur.  if you don't finish your chores, no allowance.  now start mopping.   okay, maybe it's a good thing younger people aren't in charge.  especially if they happen to be a tibble.  vroom, vroom...  beep, beep.  arthur: no problem.  i'll be right over.  where are you going.  to watch the tibbles.  they couldn't find an alligator wrestler.  it'll be fine.  i've done this before.  remember how i told them a scary story.  that seems like a long time ago.  i don't think it'll work anymore.  trust me.  that's why mrs. tibble called me.  i'm an expert tibble tamer.  : gimme.  : mine.   no, mine.  wait, stop.  my book.  that was fun.  yeah.  let's read another one.   no.  stop.  time for lunch.  how come he gets the bigger plate.  i could only find one small one that wasn't broken.  i should get the bigger plate.  i'm older.  no, i am.  uhuh.  i asked grandma, remember.  yeah but i asked her after that.  grandma.  that's a wonderful question.  how clever of you boys to ask.  tell him i'm older, right.  no, you told me, grandma.  i am.  well, i know one of you is older.  i remember, the older one's name started with a "t." that's me.  no, me.  grandma: here we are.  according to this, timmy was born at exactly 5:24 p.m.  that means i'm older.  i told you.  and tommy was born at exactly 5:22 p.m.  that means tommy's older.  you mean... he's my big brother.  that's right.  tommy is your big brother.  by two whole minutes.  there, there, timmy.  it's not a big deal.  you'll understand that when you're my age.  now go take your nap.   after that, tommy was a big help.  he made timmy be quiet and he acted like a grownup for the whole rest of the day.  i don't think we'll have any more trouble with the tibbles.  he doesn't know them very well, does he.    let's all count to one    let's all count to one   ready, set, one, you're done.  one.   counting up to one.   that show's for babies.  let's all count to one...   announcer: now, back to super action team.  go away, timmy.  you're too little to watch this.  but i want to watch it, too.  you have to wait till you're older.   okay, two minutes are up.  you're old enough.  yeah.  coming up next: the secrets of moss.  it's over.  i missed it.  timmy: grandma.  grandma.  i'm tired of tommy being older.  when do i get to be the big brother.  isn't that cute.  what.  what's cute.  well, it's like this.  timmy: no....   .  . d.w..  grandma says i'll never be older than tommy.  never.  that's why i'm running away.  : it's not fair.  here, drink this.  you'll feel better.  he's always going to be the boss of me.   no, he is not.   timmy, listen to me.  just because someone is older, that doesn't make them the boss of you.  tommy doesn't know that.  that's why i'm coming to live with you.  no.  i mean... don't worry.  you don't have to move.  i can solve all your olderbrother problems.  you can.  no problem.  five dollars.  i don't have five dollars.  i've only got... a nickel.   fair enough.   you just have to learn how to make older brothers do what you want.  but how.  listen and learn, my friend.  listen and learn.  breakfast time, boys.   now timmy, give that back or i'll give you a timeout.  but tommy, this is for little kids.  you don't want to eat baby food, do you.  no.  this is for grownups.  grandma's prunes 'n' millet husks.  let's ride bikes.   i'll race you.  whoa.  i knew you were too big for training wheels, so i took them off.   this one isn't for you.  you have to use the one for big boys.  i don't feel so good.  it's working.  tommy isn't talking about being older anymore.  that means that you're ready to move on to phase two: operation rockthecradle.  good luck.  timmy, grandma says it's lunchtime.  timmy: googoo.  timmy.  gaagaa.   gaagaa.  what are you doing.  play.  play, play, play.  quit it.  people are going to see you.   you, boy.  be nice to your baby brother.   that's no baby, that's tommy.  he's not me.  he's wearing my kerchief.  i'm tommy.  i'm tommy.  i need my diedy changed.  grandma.  where are you going.  tibbles.  it's completely under control.  tommy has gotten so mature that he does all the work.  this is going to be the easiest job ever.  i almost feel sorry for him.   hi, i'm...    timmy: yeah, pass it, tommy.  yeah, woohoo.  all right.  mine. my ball.  come on, timmy.   tommy did the most darling thing today.  he asked me to say i made a mistake.  well, bless me.  i read it incorrectly.  it seems you were both born at the same moment.  you're exactly the same age.   it's a fib, but if it helps the boys get along, we can wait till they're older to tell them.   oops.  i'm afraid you have your work cut out for you today.  i got it. i got it.  i don't know how you do it.  being an older brother is awful.  yay, woohoo.  all right.  well, have fun.   sounds like tommy learned his lesson.  i like happy endings, don't you, kate.   and now...  ms. connelly: tell me the important parts of this clock that we need to know about if we are telling time.  my name is kadidiatou.  my teacher is ms. connelly.  she's teaching us all about time.  connelly: we are going to make a giant clock.  connelly: keep it tight, keep it tight.  and look at that.  kadidiatou: we're learning about hours and minutes.  if you were the minute hand, do something with your body to show that you're long.  what if you were the short hour hand.  oh, look at jaymier.  he's the short hour hand.  tommy and timmy were born two minutes apart, and that got us thinking about time.  connelly: amalio, be the minute hand for sebastian.  he's making 10:00.  kadidiatou: we estimated how many things we can do in one minute.  we're going to do jumping jacks.  go.  boy: i think i can do 50.  one minute feels like a long time.  eight...  and time's up.  yes.  i guessed i would do 20, but i really did 68.  sixtyeight.  yeah.  boy: i feel good, but i'm tired.  i estimate i could make my tower this high.  go.  we're going to make a tower in one minute.  time was going so fast.  time's up.  oh, man.  i thought i could build it this high, but i built it smaller.  we could have made it bigger if we had more time.  go.  i'm going to see if i can hula hoop for one whole minute.  whoo.  the minute felt so long.  i'm still doing it.  wow, i'm doing it.  i had to twist my hips over and over again and now i'm dizzy.  all: and now...  there are some things you really don't want once someone else has used them.   we brought you a present.  thanks.    arthur: like coloring books.  for nothing.  arthur: or...   oh. sorry.  i forgot my toothbrush, so i'm borrowing yours.  arthur: toothbrushes.  or...  aw, i forgot my gym socks.  i have extras.  ew.  arthur: gym socks.   or the newspaper, after pal used it as a chew toy.  you think that's bad.  i'd rather have any of those used things than what i got.  wait 'til you hear this story.  hey.  since when do you get to open the show.   and the world seemed to smile all around    so it wouldn't be proper    if made of silk were another    my sweet little alice blue gown.    that sounded real sweet, ladonna.  mama, i want that hippo.  bud, you already have a hippo.  it's about this big and you use it in the bath, remember.  i'm the only person in merry madrigals with a solo.  no one else has one.  just me.  so i can't be looking like something the cat dragged in.  we don't have a cat.  hey, let's get a cat so it can drag ladonna.  i'd like to see that.  she's just pulling your leg, buddy.  mama, you're not listening.  i'm sorry, sugar.  go on.  what i'm trying to say is, i should have a new dress.  something pretty.  something special.  something...   something like that.  mrs. compson: you're right.  i am.  you do need a new dress.  there, now, isn't that pretty.  stand up straight so i can get this hem done.  but this dress isn't new.  it's new to you, sassafras.    hey, ladonna.  have you seen my hippo.  i hate being the middle child.  just once, i'd like to be the first one to wear a new dress.  this one's been passed around more than a worn penny.  it's probably been in the family as far back as anyone can remember.  i bet the romans had it first.  then it was handed down...  and handed down...   and handed down...  and it'll keep getting handed down way into the future.  i never get anything new.  i can't be singing a solo wearing this old thing.  hey, careful with that.  some day it might be mine.  i'm not going to sing wearing that mess, and that's final.  they'll just have to get someone to replace me.  replace you.  why.  i don't have anything to wear.   is that all.  relax. i'll lend you something.  i've been dying to give you a makeover since you came here.  step into my office.  wow.  we'll use my new capri di vapida clothing app.  all we have to do is enter your skin tone, hair color, eyes...  and it will pick out the perfect match for you.  it's loading.  it's loading...  it's loading...  it's loading...   i want that one.  that one.  but it's so new, bailey hasn't even entered it into my database yet.  never mind.  it's for a good cause.  one has to help those without style whenever one can.  muffy, thank you so much.  i'll be extra special careful with it.  i won't touch it or wear it.  i won't even look at it until the concert tomorrow night.  it's going straight home and into my closet.  oh, maybe i can try it on just once.  after all, i have to see if it fits.  there you are, hippy.  i should have known you'd be hiding in the mud.   and in every shop window, i primped passing by...   bud: hey, ladonna, heads up.  hippy's coming to say hi.   get away.  i'm sorry.  you're filthy.  it was hippy's fault.   phew.  tommy: hey, ladonna.  want a mud pie.  drat.  we need more mud.  be right back.    careful, rutabaga.  that bench was just painted.   no....  : okay, ladonna.  you got to tell muffy the truth.  treat it just like ripping off a bandage.  no dosidoing around.  just fess up and take your licks.  ladonna: so, anyway, we got this pygmy hippo from this zoo going out of business, and...  he's as cute as a button, name's fred, but, well, fred's kind of messy and...  jenna, come here.  wait 'til you see what ladonna is wearing tonight.  cute, cute, cuute.  oh, did you get a new dress.  um, yeah, about the dress.  it's...  sure is cute.  i know.  i gave it to her.  don't i have great taste.  anjust think, you're going to be the first to wear it.  yep.  and the last.  oh, hey, there.  i couldn't find the eraser i borrowed from you yesterday, so i bought you a new one.  that's it.  i'll just buy the same dress and replace it.  muffy will never know the difference.  saleswoman: with tax, the total comes to...   : how can one little dress cost so much money.  it'll take years to pay muffy back.   here's this week's payment for your dress.  only 100 more years and you'll be paid off in full.  what am i going to do.  hey, there.  ready for your big solo.  come on, let's see that dress.  um, actually, i'd rather...  make a big entrance.  i get it.   something like that.   oh, that is cute.   in my sweet little alice blue gown    when i first wandered down into town    i was so proud inside as i felt every eye    and in every shop window i primped passing by    a new manner of fashion i found    and the world seemed to smile all around    so it wouldn't be proper    if made of silk or another    my sweet little alice blue gown.    well.  you have got some explaining to do.  i know.  i'm sorry.  i ruined your dress.  i just tried it on to see if it fit, and then i got paint on it, so i went to the store...  you mean this one.  i bought one just like it so we could be matchies.  oh, that one's nice, too.  what do you mean, "too".  muffy, i'll pay you back for the one i messed up.  i promise.  it'll take me 100 years.  but mama always says we compsons have longevity in our family.  my greatgrandma lena lived to be 108.  oh, please.  i couldn't have worn the dress i lent you anyway.  it was robin's egg blue, which really isn't my color.  this one is cerulean warbler.  i'm upset because you didn't ask me for help.  you've seen my closet.  i could have given you another cute outfit to wear.  like this one.  that's awful nice of you, muffy.  but my house isn't safe for highfalutin' fashion.  besides, i think i'm more comfortable in my own clothes.  you sang real pretty, sugar.  and you looked real pretty, too.  let me get a picture.  wait.  get us both.  aren't we stylish.   whicharthurcharacter are you.  i am a francine...   ...because i really like sports.  would you just shoot already.   i like soccer.  woohoo. give it up for francine the soccer queen.  i
