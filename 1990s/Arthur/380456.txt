 tart    and i say hey.   hey.   what a wonderful kind of day    if we could learn to work and play    and get along with each other.   hey.   what a wonderful kind of day    hey. what a wonderful kind of day.   hey.  arthur: hey, d.w.  hey.  whoa.   fern: lakewood elementary.  peaceful, safe, happy, carefree.    buster: try again.  fern:this shuddersome school is really the scene of desperate and dastardly deeds.  only a detective of the keenest abilities could solve this disturbing dilemma...   a detective such as...  buster: wait. this is all wrong.  try it again, pal.   there was some trouble going on, big trouble and big trouble needs a guy with a big brain and big nerves to take care of it.  that's me, buster baxter, private eye in the city of the strawberries.  fern: oh, please.  you don't know the first thing about detecting.  i know the first thing and a lot more.  do you know what the eighth thing is.  i bet you don't.  i guess we'll find out, won't we.  i guess so.    mr. morris: "binky rules".    oheyoheyoheyohey    oheyoheyoheyohey    oheyoheyoheyohey, ohey...   this is the best song ever.  the radio station should play this song all day.   oheyoheyoheyohey, ohey...   we've got to find out what it's called.  you will definitely make the travel team, binky.  i never knew i had such talented feet.  buster: the endnow we can hear the name.  d.j.: that's our most requested song today, the popular...    was that a kick or was that a kick.  now we'll never find out the name.  the group is finnish.  let's call the united nations.  binky, i want to talk to you.  you may think if the chalk washes away it's not graffiti but it's graffiti as sure as if you'd carved it in stone.  but i didn't do any graffitiinging, mr. morris.  if i see any more, you'll be spending recess with a scrub brush, not a soccer ball.   binky: "binky rules."  that's not chalk, is it.  i'll get the brush.  binky: thanks a lot for helping, guys.  i never had to wash a wall before.  you better not do this again.  i didn't do thisthistime.  or the last time.  or the next time.  well, why would someone be writing your name all over the school.  very mysterious.  mysterious like in mystery.  we need someone to solve this problem, and i know who to ask.  come on.  why didn't she askyou.  you solved the missing quarters mystery.  why couldn't you solve this.  and why are we the only ones scrubbing the wall.  now this mysterious graffiti has been left twice and it wasn't me.  of course nota person who wrote graffiti in his own name wouldn't be smart.  yeah.  yeah...  itwasn'tme.  arthur: binkyask buster thereal detective.  what.  fern found my bracelet.  buster found money.  realdetectives find money.  girldetectives find jewelry.  muffy: then why is there one nancy drew but two hardy boys.  obviousthey can't handle the work.  brain: the hardys solved problems.  nancy drew catches criminals by wearing attractive pastels.  please, girls are good at details.  boys just bully people.  oh, yeah.  : yeah.  wait.  i say they work together.  that way we've got one of each.  i think we should question mr. morris first.  : okay...  well, who put youin charge.  nobody.  do you...  ahem.  i'mthe more experienced investigator.  oh. well, i already found the first piece of evidencepink chalk used by the graffitiist.  aha.  first rule of detecting, buster: never sit on your evidence.   so you left that area unattended while you went to get binky.  it was only for a minute.   i'll take over the q&a.  okay, put me wise.   buster: that song.  mr. morris: hey, it's almost 3:00.  i got to get back to work.  phooey.  you distracted our witness.  and what is that getup.  don't blow a fuse, tootsie.  what's next.  listen, pinkycrooker this evidence stuff is a wet smack.  all you'll do is win the porcelain hairnet.  am i supposed to understand what you're saying.  brain, you know your goulash.  binky's gonna clutch the gummy.  if you want to know tomorrow's menu it's by the cafeteria.  mmhmm.  aha.  very interesting.  can we move on.  hey, gopher ball, what do you know about this shenanigag on binky.  just when i thought you couldn't possibly get any stranger.  looks like binky's taking the pancake fall.  oh, will you please speak english..  nobody seems to know anything.  i think that's very odd.  you'reodd, buster.  i think maybe binkydid write the graffiti and he's making me work with you so i won't learn the truth.  were you spying on me.  hardly, foofooi do my best noodlework at high altitudes.  so what have you found out.  i've nearly solved it, binky.  oh, fern thinks it's you.  i do not.  it's so obvious it's you, it's obviously not you.  i better see some results soon.  i'm so nervous about this i can't even kick the ball right.  buster: okay, binky wants us to make the riffle.  we need solutions.  i have one possible idea...  i have an idea, too.  what's yours.  you first.  no,youfirst.  i bet you don't have an idea.  i do so.  then what is it.  well, what's yours.  you first.   go tell mr. morris...  unless it's abadidea.  i'll tell mr. morrismyidea if you tell him yours.  deal.  deal.  fern: well...  here's my idea...  it was tough it was dangerous but i have the solution.  binky... has an evil twin.  he's out to ruin your life so he can take over your identity.   binky: wow.  an evil twin.  i wonder where he lives.  my theory is a bit more reasonable.  a rival school is doing this to get binky in trouble so he can't try out for the travel soccer team.  that's possible.  i'll make sure no troublemakers get on the school grounds.  what a relief.  now that evil twin will get in trouble, not me.  : an evil twin.  oh, brother.  you sure showedhim.  a rival soccer team.  oh, brother.  you sure showed her.  uh... yeah. uh... yeah.  look, buster...  i want to...  didn't see anythingno soccer players no evil twins, no...   fern and buster: "binky rules".  binky: uhoh.  that darn evil twin.  some detectivesweare.  we let our client go up the river.  here.  mustardyellow paint...  looks acrylic.  mr. gearythe hardware store.  he may know who bought it.  mr. geary: i've never seen this color before.  i sure don't sell it here.  that was our last chance.  we've failed binky.  :  oheyoheyoheyohey, ohey...    hey, it's that song.  how can you think of music at a time like this.  ah. that's it.  binkythis is the last straw.  look. look.  "binky" is the name of that new group.  d.j. this is my fault, guys.  i told my staff to go around town stir up interest in this new band named "binky." they went too far.  start cleaning.  to make up for itfree copies for everyone.  there are 32 songs.  which is the one we like.  "goodbye, vasternorrland." no, i think it's "snowee snowee, slushee slushee." good work, detective.  you, too, detective.  :  oheyoheyohey...    hit it up, skeezix.  i'm in nadaville.  kids: and now...  this is the arthur team.  we're trying to solve a mystery.  we're looking for clues to find some animals.  there's one.  there's two.  we're the buster team.  look, we found a clue.  this is the binky team.  that way.  we're the d.w. team.  i see one.  we have to solve the mystery and look for those fish.  the clues were animal tracks.  look, here's a clue.  look, here it is.  that way.  we found one.  hey, there's one.  over there.  i found one.  i see one.  we found clues that led us all the way down here.  oh, it's an owl.  and we found animals.  i found a turtle.  got one.  it's a crab.  a lobster.  i found a sea horse.  i found a salmon.   i think we solved the mystery.  i found another crab.  and now...  if there's one thing everyone's talking about it's binky.  hi.  not that binkythis binky.  binky:  oheyoheyoheyohey...   their song went straight to number one.  for the 47th time today, binky.  and in the "whatever happened to" category "crazy bus."  oheyoheyoheyohey    oheyoheyoheyoh    oheyoheyoheyohey    oheyoheyoheyoh    oheyoheyohey, oheyoheyoheyoh...    arthur: we can't get enough of binky.  no, not that binky.  then there's all the binky stuffbinky shirts, binky hats not to mention the popular binky breadmaker.  mmm... binky bread.  and going on sale tomorrow binky tickets for a binky concert.  all: binky concert..  yeah.   we're here with binky's manager, svern smith.  svern, do you think there are too many binky products.  the group is very concerned their name not be overused.  they worry about it a lot.   i want 200,000 in stores tomorrow.  so far, binky have been mysterious figures who've never given a concert or even been interviewed.  that will all change at the big show when we make a very special announcement.  but you have to be there to hear it.  so get your tickets now, now...  : now.  please.  man : tickets for binky will go on sale in six hours.    woman: we're pretty far down.  i hope we get tickets.  we have to get tickets.  otherwise, we won't hear the big announcement.  rubella cast charts for the group, auditorium and each of us so we'll know where to sit.  we must be in a row divisible by four and avoid seats ending in "ko" or "ll." where's arthur.  he said his mom was going to drop him off here.  hmm...  the purple patent leather high tops or the cherry checked moccasins.   where is arthur.  he'll never get tickets at this rate.  how can he be late for the most important event of this or any other century.  arthur has neptune in capricorn.  he's doomed binkywise.  arthur: there's a line.  i knew it.    our seats are in row 42a.  where are yours.  739xxx.  do you own a pair of binoculars.  wow. look.  francine: wouldn't it be great to meet binky.  we're just kids.  no one famous would talk to us.  no, but they'd talk to our parents and we'd be right there.   binky interview.  my priceless sapphire necklace.  how could i let it fall in the trash.  do you hear something.   found it.  binky garbage.   oheyoheyoheyohey   ..   looks like you owe an additional billion dollars.  all: oh, no.  we'll never be able to pay it all.  what about my autograph.  binky taxes. yuck.  let's go talk to our parents, quick.  my seats are terrible my friends will all meet binky and then mom will scare them back to finland.  so when do you meet binky.  my mom said binky's not hard news whatever that means.  my dad just laughed.  face it, we won't meet them.  sometimes bands pull fans from the audience to dance with them.  really.  they can't pick you, arthur.  by the time you'd get to the stage the concert would be over.   we're here with arthur read who has the worst seats for any concert ever.  wait. i've just been told you were chosen to dance with binky.  go on down.     where's binky.  the concert ended three years ago, arthur.  we're in the sixth grade now.  don't worry, we saved all your homework assignments.  want to help me with a job tomorrow night.  what about the concert.  we have to get there early.  who knows how long it'll take to get to row 739xxx.  this won't take long.  i'm catering dinner for the crew working some concert.  hey, wait.  it's at the civic auditorium, too.  the binky concert.  you're feeding binky..  we'll be backstage.  i told their manager my son was a big fan and he said you could be the first kid to see binky up close.  i'm going to meet binky.  this is arthur read the very special first boy to meet binky.   hi.  well, we can tell you're the most interesting of our fans, arthur.  come with us.   oheyoheyoheyoh    oheyohey,

with us.   you can bring your friends to meet binky.  really.  dad, that's great.  wait until i tell them.  here's a bunch of kids.  we'd invite you along, but there are so many of you you wouldn't fit in our limo.  here's some binky frozen vegetables.   mmm... turnips.  wait. what about luge.  you know, i think everyone may be busy before the concert and, uh, francine is allergic to...  curtains.  one more day till the concert.  i'm still trying to get my mom to interview binky.  if she does, i'll bring you.  friends have to stick together.  oh... thanks, buster.  hey, the radio station sent me tickets to make up for getting me in trouble.  since your seats are rotten, you can sit with my mom and me.  really.  gee, thanks, binky.  i know you'd do the same.  uh... you know, binky what if you could meet....  binky, binky.  binky, binky.  oh, and a kid with glasses.  your name is binky.  come with us.  move over, please.   sorry, no more room.  girl binky: how do you feel about luge.  oh.  i've got to go.  see you.   oheyoheyoheyohey    oheyoheyoheyoh    oheyoheyoheyohey    oheyoheyoheyoh    oheyoheyoheyohey    oheyoheyoheyoh.   can you throw these away for me.  hi.  dad: arthur, this is winston and svern.  arthur's very excited about seeing the group.  great, we'll have them set up in 15 minutes.   bah, ha, ha.    what's wrong, arthur.  this would be more fun with my friends.  but you'll be meeting binky soon.  that would be more fun with them, too.  i don't see arthur anywhere.  arthur: here i am.  my dad's working backstage, so we can all meet binky.  all: yeah.  binky is ready.  all: wow. binky.  i'm arthur read, and these are my friends.  we're excited to meet you.   all: whoa.  it's okay.  you see, binky isn't real.  that's our big announcement.  they're holograms.  i create the image on my troglibyte 2000.  and i feed the voices of the world's greatest singers into the most advanced music synthesizer known to man.  we combine the music and images and...voila.binky.     huh.  i thought it was a trash can.  sorry.  whew. as long as it wasn't an i/o operator or an angry garden salad.  actually, it was a banana.  binky sure wasn't what i expected.  i'd rather have real friends than a seethrough group.  sometimes it's just better not to know anything about celebrities.  svern: here they are... binky.   hi, everyone, it's me, buster.  it seems like everyone in elwood city is always on the move, and in my travels with my dad, i'm finding a lot more people who are really going places.  i'm jumping into the action, too, and sending it
