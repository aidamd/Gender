 hey.  arthur: hey, d.w.  hey.  whoa.   that's my favorite book.  i want to save it.  d.w.'s funny.  i think if she had room she'd save everything.  last fall...  she saved every acorn she found.   kate, i hope you didn't crack any of my acorns.   but the silliest thing she ever saved is in the freezera snowball from last winter.  close the freezer.  your snowball's not going anywhere.  i was just checking.  faster and more annoying than a mosquito...  tadah.   maybe i'm... dreaming.  ow.  no, i'm awake.   what's wrong, d....  d.w., what on earth are you doing.  : my snowball is gone.  wait, hold on.  it must be in there somewhere.  no, the most important thing i ever owned is gone.  d.w., it was just a snowball.  it was not justa snowball.  don't you remember.  oh.   arthur.     huh.   no snowballs in the house.  i want to freeze it.  why.  this was the best day of my life.  i want to keep a piece of it.  so can i.  okayput it on a plate so it doesn't stick to the freezer.  yippee.  quackquack.  d.w.: and even in the summertime i always checked on it and it was always there.  and... and now it's gone.  who would have taken your snowball.  i bet arthur knows.  steady... easy does it.   d.w., what are you looking for.   as if you didn't know.  is something missing.  you want to know what's missing.  you want to know what's missing..  all: yes.   my snowball.  snowball.  she's keeping an old snowball in the freezer.  : it wasn't just some old snowball.  when was the last time you saw it, d.w..  this calls for detective work.  take me to the scene of the crime.  it was in the freezer, buster.  when was the last time you saw the snowball, .  i asked that ten minutes ago.  d.w.: i last saw it yesterday at lunch time.  did anything unusual happen between yesterday and today.  hmm... yes.  grandma thora and mrs. macgrady stopped by on their way home from bingo.  hello, everybody.  hello, dear.  grandma.  : d.w.. my favorite grandchild.  : oh, hi, arthur.   hi, grandma.  d.w., you're so wonderful.  and how's your snowball.  arthur: hold it. hold it.  that's not what happened.  grandma doesn't know about the snowball.  well, maybe...  i'll tell you what happened.  hello, children.  arthur. you certainly have grown.  : hello, grandma.  look at me. look at me.  d.w., you're annoying grandma.  no, of course she's not.  get me an aspirin.  she's giving me a splitting headache.  grandma did not say that.  not out loud but i could tell she was thinking it.  grandma: hello.  why, hello, grandma.  how are you today.   grandma, we're trying to remember what happened when you came over yesterday.  well, i remember what happened.    arthur. d.w.. please.  pardon me, dear but i remember it a little differently.  arthur and d.w.: hello, grandma.  : we love you.  would you ladies like some ice cream.  that's right.  mom got ice cream from the freezer.  was the snowball there.  i didn't notice.  hmm.  d.w.: wait a minute.  that dog was in the kitchen.  so you think pal took your snowball.  it's possible.  he just jumped out.  francine: impossible.  dogs can't open umbrellas.  maybe he learned.  what else does he have to do all day.  sportscaster: point to agassi, that's 30love.  don't forget, buster and i were here yesterday, too.  arthur's mom invited us for ice cream.  i wish my grandchildren were more like francine.  but buster was a pig, pig.   huh.  no ice cream left.  there's more ice cream in the freezer.  oh, i'll get it.  huh.  mmm.  you're not writing, buster.  because that never happened.  we were all having ice cream...  and the other snake says, "you can't love me i'm your other end."  remind me to tell mr. haney to push you ahead a grade, buster.  francine: read you gave me warm soda.  thanks a lot.  i'll gladly get an ice cube for you.  he's so nice.  i can get my own ice cube.  darn it, there isn't any lousy ice in here.  maybe this is big enough to cool it off.  oh, that is so untrue.  wait.  what were you guys doing while i played piano for grandma.    let's see how long it takes d.w.'s snowball to melt in the sun.   we weren't there when arthur did it.   i didn't do it.  somebody did it.  i want a confession.  confess.  confess.   i've reached a conclusion by discerning the truth from eyewitness accounts.  while we were busy, a space alien maized.   buster: in a scientific search for human food he took the snowball but nothing else because he left in a hurry.   huh.  now, who left that freezer door open.  it's the only answer.  that's why the plate is missing.  that's crazy.  one of you took my snowball.  just confess, buster.  me.  why don't you.  it was probably arthur.  how could you think that.  someone should admit it.  it's not nice to do this to a little girl.  you're all in on it.  you're breaking a child's heart.  it's a conspiracy.  someone's going to get hurt feelings if we all don't calm down.  dad: hey, everybody.  look outside.  it's snowing.  the first snow of the year.  big deal.  it'll never be the same.  d.w., we'll have just as much fun as last year.  maybe more.  promise.  yeah, i do.  i wish i knew what happened to my snowball.  i told you they'd never figure it out.  so this is what they eat.  mmm, we've got to get the recipe.  kids: and now...  what happened to the snowball.  what happened to the snowball.  what happened to the snowball.  we don't know what happened to d.w.'s snowball.  we're coming up with ideas.   who took my snowball.  what happened to my snowball.  if you keep opening the freezer your snowball will melt.  four groups in our class are having a play about what happened.  this is our ending of "d.w.'s snow mystery." i'm d.w.  i'm the leprechaun.  i'm arthur.  i'm the elf.  i'm pal.   where's my snowball.  pal, where's my snowball.   last night i saw an elf and a leprechaun take the snowball.  all: the end.  i'm the freezer.  i'm the toppings.  i'm arthur's dad.  i'm the table.  i'm theinside of the refrigerator.  ooh, i'm hungry.  i hope there's something for me in the freezer.  d.w.'s father went into the freezer...  ooh, this looks good.  took the snowball out...  i'll add some whipped cream some hot fudge.  made it into a sundae and ate it.  ooh, this is good.  the end.  and now...  i'm lucky.  i have great friends.  the day i met buster was the most unforgettable moment in my life.  hi, i'm buster.  my name's arthur.  hi.  well, see ya.  arthur: and being on francine's team is the best.   arthur.   when you're on francine's team you never lose.   arthur, you lose.   aah.  ratburn: the great wall of china is 1,500 miles long.  it was built over 2,000 years ago and still stands today.  wow.  that's older than the cafeteria hot dogs.   the appian way was the chief highway from rome to greece.  it was built in 312 b.c. and is still in use today.  we'll divide into teams to study and report on ancient civilizations.  reporting on rome: arthur, francine and buster.  great team.  oh, boy.  great.  how should we do our report.  we write it then read it to the class.  no, no, we want it to be the best, right.  thenweshouldn't read it to the class,ishould.  maybe there's a more interesting way.  hmm.  ii mean, more creative.   guys, guys.  what if we write a song.  . ancient rome .  . it's not like home .  . col... osseum... .   we could do it as an interpretive dance.  with those feet.   let's make a video.  how would we make it look ancient. )
