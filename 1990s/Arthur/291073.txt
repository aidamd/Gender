computer where you can look up different books.  erica is looking up a book.  you search for a book by title, author's name or the subject.  i found a good book about wolves.  over here, we have a chapter book section.  sean and casey are looking at chapter books.  which book are you reading.  boys: more scary stories to tell in the dark.  is this book fiction or nonfiction.  fiction. it's fiction.  over here we have picture books.  we have christina and johnny.  what book are you reading.  i wish i were a butterfly.  which book are you reading.  baby duck.  over here in this section we

read.    hmm.  : what.  : this doesn't help.  i can't read.  get ready to fight.   d.w.: arthur.  : no, not two d.w.s.  the's on one of me.   we figured you'd rather fight someone your own size.  you know, you're right.  i would love to fight someone my own size.  you wait here.  i'll go find someone.   come back and fight.   d.w.: what kind of game is that.  arthur: it's not a game.  it's a model of the bell x1 rocket plane the plane that broke the sound barrier.  the sound barrier must be pretty hard because this plane is all smashed up.  it's not smashed.  i'm going to build it.  don't touchyou'll mix up the pieces.  i've never heard of toys that come broken.  i'm going.  never say i don't go when you want me to because i'm going, like that.  when you want me to go, i'm out of here.  no waiting.  go already.  and if you say please i go even faster...   is that the same broken plane you were fixing yesterday.  don't do that.  i need to concentrate.  that's a pretty color.    bye.  i've been working on the plane all week.  i'm almost done.  d.w., don't touch that.  the paint isn't dry.   mommy, arthur made my hands orange.  i never thought about it before but being an only child is nice.  it's the best thing i ever made.  arthur read, you win the blue ribbon.   this calls for a celebration snack.    did i hear you say cookies.   good boy.   d.w. read to headquarters: sound barrier broken.  what's my next mission, general.   there's a good breeze, general.   arthur read, winner of 5,000 blue ribbons requesting landing coordinates.    arthur, you made that plane all wrong.  it doesn't fly at all.  no, d.w., i made it exactly ri...  what.    if it could break the sound barrier falling out a window shouldn't break it.  i told you not to touch it.  you built it all wrong.  did you even read the directions.  it didn't fly for one second.  it's not my fault if your plane can't fly.  i told you not to touch it.   mom: arthur timothy read, come here.  uhoh, middle name.   are they goito amputake my arm.  no, honey, it's "amputate," not "amputake." they're going to amputate.  no. i'm in charge and i'm putting ice on it.   what's wrong.  : that's cold.  apologize to your sister.  no way. she should apologize to me.  i worked all week on this.  i told her a million times not to touch it.  you're bad.  arthur, this means no tv for a week.  : what.  that is so unfair.  you don't care what she did to me.  we'll deal with what she did.  but what you did is wrong, too.   arthur: so i missedbionic bunny last night and i can't watch tv all week.  can you believe that.  no, i don't believe ityou hit your sister.  that's terrible.  arthur: come on, like you never hit anybody.  buster: nope.  did you hear that.  arthur hit his sister.  i, for one, am shocked.  how could you be shocked about someone hitting someone.  well, why not.  you're binky barnes.  you always...  you know, i can't remember the last time you hit anybody.  well, what do you mean.   there's the bell.  don't want to be late.  molly: so when was it, bink.  binky does not have to remind us of his past glorious fights.  that's right.  that he is afraid of no one is a factoid.  that's right.  and he can prove it by socking the very next kid who turns that corner.  that's right... what.  molly: go ahead, binky.  sock him.  maybe i don't feel like it.  you better, or you're out of the club.  i can't be out of the club.  it's my club.  i founded it.  if you wanted everything your way you shouldn't have a club.  the next time you see that kid, you sock him.  the next time i see arthur, i have to hit him.  oh, what can i do.  hey, what if i never see him.  arthur, why didn't you just apologize.  oh, come on.  she wrecked my plane.  why can't anybody see my side of this.  uh, because you're wrong.  hey, binky, did you hear that arthur hit his sister.  i haven't seen arthur.  as far as i know, arthur isn't even here.  binky's so upset about what arthur did that he won't even look at him.  when the day and night are of equal length it's called the equinox.   you sock that kid yet.  haven't seen him.   i am so smart.  psst, hey, is arthur in there.  yeah.  i'll... just eat outside, then.  binky won't even eat near arthur.  that's awful.  we should bring them together.  arthur will thank us.  buster: binky's out here somewhere.   i'll get it.  thanks.  sue ellen: binky.  what are you doing.  avoiding arthur.  if i don't see him, i don't have to hit him.  oh. why would you want to hit arthur.  i don't. that's why i don't want to see him.  hmm.  boys.  is arthur in there.  no.  : ah, thank you.  thank you, thank you so much.  she broke my plane.  but she's just a little girl.  saying d.w. is just a little girl is like saying a tornado is just a little wind. )
