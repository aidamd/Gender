"she," mary moo cow.  this one.  honey, there'll be lots of kids there to see her.  i know, that's why you can't tell her i'm related to arthur.  d.w.: do you think mary has spinach for dinner.  i could eat it once or twice maybe just to be polite, but not every night.  oh, and do you think she...  well, she's gone.  that means...  both: dark bunny.  d.w.: and i know mary loves babies so kate could come and visit when mary and me have our days off.    i'm sorry.  mary can't take everybody.  oh, my.  i'm sorry, honey.  what.  what's it say.  mom: no mary moo cow today i'm afraid.  they canceled it.   tv announcer: in the raindrenched streets of dark city where the sun never rises only one person stands between crime and humanity...  mary moo cow.  both: huh.  mary couldn't come.  okay, the party's over.  it'smyturn.  mary moo cow: this is an extraspecial episode and do you know why.  kids: because it's our last episode.  that's right, boys and girls: last, last.  let's sing it.  :  last, that spells...    both: all right.  what. what does that mean.  mary moo cowis history.  mom.  both:  last, that spells last    no moremary moo cow.  i'm sorry, d.w.  but that's what happens to all tv shows eventually.  they get canceled.  you mean it'll never be on again.  i know it seems awful right now, honey but think of all the other fun things you can do now at 3:30.  and you do have a few videotapes.  mom. dad.  you'll punish arthur, right.  good night, d.w.  dad: think of all the other fun things you can do now at 3:30.  come on, we're supposed to have fun.   what's fun about it.  withoutmary moo cow...  there's onlydark bunny.   d.w. : uhuhuh.  it's still my tv time.  and welcome to the first afternoon edition ofstock market today.  mom.  it's useless, arthur.  she said i could keep this time until i recover from my trauma.  mom.  come on, d.w., this is so boring.  let's go out and play.  uhuh.  it's not fair.  if i can't have mary moo cowanymore he can't havedark bunny.  there was a commotion...  :  hey d.w., hey d.w.     let's go play, right away.   i said no, nadine.  anchor: this historic building was saved from demolition when concerned citizens obtained 500 signatures on a petition.  d.w.: it's called a petition.  if enough of us sign it then they must bring mary moo cowback.  why would we do that.  because you can sign with finger paint.  sign a petition to bring backmary moo cow.  only five cents.  you don't charge to sign petitions.  grownups always think something's important if it costs money.  huh.  okay, i just need one more signature.  if you sign it i'll let you watch dark bunny.  i couldn't stand it if i'm a part of bringing backmary moo cow.  fine.  mom, i'm ready to mail it.  arthur: mail for mary moo cow.  boys and girls, do you know what this is.  what.  :  a petition    here is a petition    spell "petition"    pet... oh.    something, something, something.    now we can get out of here    d.w., you've brought us cheer.   ..    somethingsomethingsomething   ..    somethingsomethingsomething   all:   what's it say. what's it say.  that the person in the mary moo cow costume is really happy you made a petition: happy.  but the show is still canceled so you should let your brother watchdark bunny because it's still on the air.   you're funny.  "dear d.w., mary moo cow is very happy "that you cared enough "to circulate a petition on her behalf.  no matter what the letter says you should be proud of taking the action...  just read it, mom, please.   "while mary cannot make more shows at this time..." aha.  no.  "...she would like "to personally thank you by inviting you to the studios of channel 12, home ofthe mary moo cow show." hooray. it worked.  it didn't work.  the show is still canceled.  you just wait until i have a little talk with mary.  d.w.: dad, i think you made a wrong turn somewhere.  this isn't mary's barn.  no, it's the studio where the show is filmed.  the barn is inside.  : oh... that mary.  textile up 1 7/8 while pork products continue to fall...  and this is where mary moo cow always had her moo cow sock puppet shows.  have we given you a moo cow sock puppet yet.  this is all

have you taken mary's place.  where did you put her.  i didn't put her anywhere.  mary just wanted a change.  everybody needs a change, don't you think.  no.  maybe.  no.  don't worry.  she might very well turn up again someday and you'll have the satisfaction of knowing your petition had a lot to do with it.  well, goodbye, little girl.  there you are.  d.w., you don't just burst in on people's dressing rooms.  that's all right.  i was pleased to meet her.  : goodbye.   : i mean, goodbye.  come on, d.w., it's time to go.  mary moo cow:, i love you    yes, i do...   mary.  news anchor :..  don't worry, i'm not even going to ask.  huh.  that's okay.  you can watch your show.  i'll see mary... some other time.  dark bunny,here i come.  announcer:..of dark bunny have been canceled so that we can bring you the original classic episodes of every boy and girl's favorite series the mary moo cow show.   both:..  here we go.  let's do this.  five... four... three... two...  i'm caroline.  and i'm kenny.  we're going to take you behind the scenes of another great kids' show.  it'szoomcome on.  this is the studio where we film all the segments you see onzoom.  you're mixing into this.  caroline's about to do a zoomdo.  it's like an arts and crafts project.  this is homemade chalk.  the idea to make it was sent in from rock hill...  is that right.  well, she has to memorize all her lines.  quickly stir in two spoonfuls of liquid tempera paint.  they'll come out really neat.  i just made chalk, and it was just a lot of fun and i got paint all over my hands.  this is ourzoomzone and we hang out in here when we aren't filmingzoom.  this is our little miniature model of like a world and this is an art project we do when we're not shootingzoom.  kenny: another project we're working on here in thezoomzone is the rube goldberg invention.  whoops.  here we go.   it worked.  man:.. four... three... two...  most pizza you eat has cheese, vegetables and pepperoni on it, but have you...  kenny is rehearsing for a "znack," znack.  he's making fruit pizza.  now all that's left is digging in.  wow. he did it in one take.   only one take, and you were right.  did it in one take.  and now back tozoom.  arthur.  arthur.   yeah, let's go.   buster: hey, mom.  up high.  down low.  in the middle.  and away we go.   busternd his mom are really good friends.  they do everything together.  they go to movies.  the animation is terrible, the plot is dumb and the songs give you a headache.  that's what we said after the first time we saw it.  i know, once more and i'm sure we'll be cured.  they do chores together.  detergent, sponge, soap, paper towels...  hmm...   17 minutes and 54 seconds.  a new record.  sometimes they just go out for lunch together.  but all that might change when buster meets...  my boyfriend.  girl : help.  help.  bionic bunny, where are you.  someone's in trouble.  never fear.  bionic bunny is here.  oh, thank goodness.  i have the most terrible splinter.  : could you please take it out.  don't do it. it's a trap.   arthur: i'm in the red zone.  me, too.  she is such an alien.  you're no little girl.  you're...   kodo, from the crab nebula.  prepare to be neutralized.    oh, hold on, that's clwaiting.   hello.  just a minute.  mom. it's for you.  bitzi: thank you, dear.  yes.  well, hello.   why, thank you.   you never came back from callwaiting.  i was on the phone for 20 minutes.  sorrymy mom took the phone and went into her room.  she's been acting really weird lately.  how so.  well, she smiles all the time.  and sometimes when she's on the phone, she gets all giggly.  boyfriend.  what.  my mom does not have a boyfriend.  any unexpected deliveries of flowers lately.  huh... now that you mention it...  when she's doing something does she stop suddenly, stare into space and sigh like this.   well, just once or twice.  i rest my case.  boyfriend.  maybe shedoes have a boyfriend.  but who.  your book reports were all satisfactory with a few exceptions.  great...  another f.  what.  this can't be mine.  : it is.  that's my pizza stain.  i'm telling you, arthur, it's him.  mr. ratburn's my mother's boyfriend.  that's ridiculous.  oh, yeah.  well, look at this.  when was the last time i t an a in his class.  well...  he probably gave it to me so i'd like him better.  oh. this is the end.  i'm doomed.  first, he'll come over to dinner.   delightful dinner, my dear.  well, buster, only one slice left.  guess the number i'm thinking of between one and ten, and it's yours.  seven.  no, it was 3.141592675 also known as "pi".  get itpi... pie.    buster: and then they'll get married.  do you, nigel charles ratburn take bitzi lynne baxter to have and to hold for better or for worse, through sickness and in health from this day forward :  till death do you part.    i do.  but i must tell you, sir that's a runon sentence.  try breaking it up with a few periods.  then they'll have...  children.  read to me.  read me a big book...  in french.  let's play algebra.  whoa.   daddy. buster broke my chemistry set.   keep it down.  he's coming this way.  arthur, you've got to do something.  tell him my mother's ugly and crazy.  no.  ratburn:.. arthur.  um... mr. ratburn did you know that buster's mother...  has giant lizards that she feeds rats to.  really. i love lizards.  i had a gila monster named morty but i never fed him rats.  fascinating.  oh, great.  now the house is going to be full of lizards, too.  thanks a lot.  i couldn't think of anything.  dinner on friday sounds great.  just let me run it by buster.  bye.     : please don't marry mr. ratburn, mom.  he'll give you homework.  he'll make you redo your pies.  marry mr. ratburn.  buster, what are you talking about.  well, all those flowers and phone calls.  that's him, right.  that's not nigel ratburn, buster.  that's harry mills.  it isn't mr. ratburn.  whoopee.   would it be all right with you if he had dinner with us on friday.  sure.  wait a minute.  who's harry mills.  all i know is that he writes about sports for the newspaper tells jokes and loves kids.  he sounds great.  yeah, too great.  arthur, what if he's...  one ofthem.  what do you mean.  you know.  : an alien.   you'll just love what's for dessert.  you.    kodo, my lord, i bring you two fresh earthlings.  good work, horseshoe.   buster, he's not an alien.  do you have proof.  i don't need proof.  well, you're probably right.  but it doesn't hurt to be sure.   is that your final answer.   it works.   bitzi: buster, could you get it.  i'm not ready yet.   knock, knock.  who's there.  venice.  venice who.  venice you going to invite me in.  hi, buster.  i'm harry.   whoops.  sorry.  hmm.  and by the time the batter slid into home all he had on was his boxer shorts.   buster baxter. where are your manners.   it wasn't my fault.  he's making me laugh.  he's right.  i'm sorry.  i tell funny stories when i'm nervous and...  harry, your tie.  actually, it looks better with crab chowder on it.   that was delicious.  now, how about a little dessert.    i'll get some plates.  let me help you.   whew.  you do like boston cream pie, don't you.  yep.  actually, it's my favorite.  mine, too.  thanks for having me over, buster.  i had a great time.  me, too.  i'll tuck you in in just a minute.  buster : well, even if he is an alien, he sure is a nice one.   so, what did you think of harry.  he's okay.  you didn't like him, did you.  : well, we don't have to see him again if you don't want to.  no, i did like him, really.  it's just that you and i won't hang out as much because you'll be spending all your time with harry.  that's not going to happen, buster.  you're always going to be the most important person in my life.  promise.  i promise.  up high.  down low.   yes.  did you see that.  what a shot.  ratburn: ahem.  i just wanted to let you know i've done some research and you shouldn't feed big lizards rats.  it makes them sluggish.  what on earth is he talking about.  who knows.  maybe he's...  one ofthem. one ofthem.   yep, definitely an alien.  kids: and now...  brown: the idea for pal came when we wanted to get a pet at our house, and i invented a pet that arthur could have.  i start with this oval shape, and then i give him eyes and a little triangle for his nose.  and pal's a pretty happy dog, so we'll make him smiling.  and we'll add his ears.  now we'll give him his collar, and he's off for an adventure.   visit us online at pbskidsgo.org.  you can
