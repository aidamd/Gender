 then there was ms. schmegeggi.  she made great cookies, but she was clumsy.   these housespoor design, rotten construction.  the worst was mrs. featherfoffer.   man: kimberly, i know you weren't there.  kimberly: oh, roger, if you must know, i...  i was... bungee jumping.   don't make noise.  go to bed.  it's daytime.  go to bed.  some babysitters are a real pain and i don't know why, because it's the easiest job on earth.     wait. come back.    don't push the stroller too fast.  okay, dad.  .  why are you so blue....  and green and red.  we did fingerpainting in school.  neat. how'd you get paint all over you.  it was those tibble twins.  they're driving me crazy.  they should be in cages.  they can't be that bad.  d.w.: you don't know.  they give our teacher headaches.  don't get too closethat's where they live.    hey, d.w..  hey, d.w...  i said it louder.  hey, d.w....  i said it loudest.  let's run, okay.  they don't look so bad.  what's the problem.  d.w.: they're the problem.  why, hello, d.w.  hi, mrs. tibble.  i can say it louder.  you certainly can, sweetheart.  has anyone seen the babysitter.  she had to go homesuddenly.   oh, dear.  i have no babysitter and i must go next door to visit mrs. fogal.  you know, arthur is a great babysitter and i'm sure he'd be glad to do it.  oh, would you.  it would help me out so much.  just for an hour or so.  sure i can do it.  i'll be back this afternoon.  twins: yay.  arthur: i can't play kickball.  i'm babysitting the tibbles.  you mean the terrible twins.  what do you mean.  my sister babysat for them once, just once.  she's still having nightmares about it.  tibble...  tibble...  tibble...    what did they do.  i don't know.  she wouldn't talk about it.  back out of it while you're still alive.  it'll be like watching d.w. and kate.   i'm hungry, too.  ..   aah.  the tibbles are a little worse than your sisters.  i've got to go.  be tough.  you're in charge and what you say goes.  we may never see him again.  arthur, come in.  yahoo.   my grandsons are very energetic but i don't think that will be a problem.     are you okay, arthur.   grandmother: arthur is here.  twins: so what.  faster. faster.  whee.  that's tommy in the red kerchief and timmy in the blue one.  they should sleep until i'm back.  see you later, boys.   she's gone.    mountain lion on the loose.  tommy. timmy. tom...  don't move.  it's a vicious mountain lion.  look, guys...  it's nap time.  you tired.  no. you.  no. we're not tired.  we want to play hideandseek.  prunella: be tough on them or you're dead.  what i say goes: it's nap time...  now.  we're not tired.  look.  listen to me.  i'm the babysitter.  hey.   stop that right now.   yahoo.  whoa.   hello.  hi, arthur, it's d.w.  just calling to see how things are going.    they won't take a nap no matter how much i order them.  try playing a game to calm them down.  they'll get tired.  good idea.  thanks, d.w.  just don't let them have any paint.   hey, guys, let's play a game.  oh, boy.  let's play hideandseek.  nope. how about playing cards.  i know a good game.  it's called 52 pickup.  ..  ..  ..  52.  catch.  mmm...  let's play hideandseek.  no. you wouldn't be interested in playing cowboy, would you.  yay. yeah.  okay.  now, i'll be the sheriff and you're my deputies.  i'm your boss and...  we're the bad guys and you can't catch us.    d.w.: hello.  arthur.  arthur can't come to the phone.  he's all tied up.  you ready to play hideandseek.  okay, okay.  you're it.  count to 20.  ..  20.  ready or not, here i come.  it's nice and quiet now.  too quiet.  oh, no. what if they went out.  i'll be in big trouble.  and so would the town.    aah.    this is arthur's fault.  he was supposed to watch them.  yeah, it's arthur's fault.  he's going to pay for this.   d.w.: arthur. is that you.  what happened.  arthur: hmm.  i can't talk now.  i'm looking for the twins.  : i think they left.   you'll go to jail for losing two innocent children.  i'm especially worried because...  : the swamp thing might get them.  the what.  the swamp thing rises every day around this time to hunt for something to eat.  uh, arthur... are you feeling all right.   i'll call you back.   the swamp thing is outside.  what do we do..  sit down a safe distance from the doors and windows and i'll tell you.  the swamp thing is a nasty creature covered with green, slimy gunk, and it's always hungryhungry for twin boys.  but twins are hard to find so he's always very hungry and that makes him madmean mad.  and you can't hear him sneaking up... behind you.   but as he walks the swamp thing drips a trail of stinky swamp water.   swamp thing.  hello, boys, i brought some ice cream from mrs. fogal.  it's melting.  twins: grandma.  they didn't feel tired, so we played.  i'll clean up.  twins: can we help arthur clean up. please.  you want to help clean up.  i think i might faint.  you are the first babysitter who didn't run screaming from the house like running from a monster.  because the monsters are on my side.  see you later, guys.  twins: goodbye, arthur.  you're home early.  couldn't take it, huh.  didn't i tell you.  they were horrible.  admit you were wrong.  admit it.  we had so much fun mrs. tibble wants me to watch them every afternoon.  and you're going to do it.  they just want to have fun, not be bossed around.  they asked me to bring you along tomorrow so they'd have somebody their own age to play with.  d.w.: mommy. will you take my temperature.  i feel really, really, really sick.  kids: and now...  arthur thought it was the easiest job.  arthur: i'm the babysitter.  when he first comes to the house he thinks it's going to be kind of easy.  arthur: it's the easiest job on earth.  it's not the easiest job.  the job of a babysitter is to...  take care of the kids.  so kids could be safe.  a babysitter has to know what to do...  be careful...  and not to be so bossy.  you have to take care of them, feed them change the diapers if they are little kids...  make sure they don't get into trouble.  child 1: we are making a handbook for babysitters.  child 2: this handbook is for babysitters to tell them how to be a babysitter.  child 3: try to be kind.  child 4: you could take them to a friend's house.  child 5: don't watch tv and forget the kids.  make sure they don't talk to strangers if they play outside.  you have to feed them lunch or fix them breakfast.  give the kids ice cream for dinner and... let the kid stay up late.   at night before they go to sleep you could read them a story before they go to sleep.  all: be a good babysitter.  kids: and now...  arthur: i hope this never happens to you.  dad: hurry, they'll be here soon.   mom...  you missed a spot.  no, it's not cleaning day.  you missed a spot, mom.  aah.  d.w.: higher...  higher...  higher...  a little lower...  lower...  lower...  no, it's not a holiday.  lawn mowed.  check.  party fun list.  check... it's not a formal dinner.  beds made. teeth brushed. dog fed.  check, check, check.  there, daddy that's perfect.  it's all these things and more.  we're as ready as we'll ever be.   welcome to the read family reunion.     dad: can you get that, arthur.  don't forget the list.  hi, welcome to the read...  gotcha. hey there, artie, like my new camera.  this supernova solar flash is a real dandy.  don't just stand there, mr. piano man, invite us in.  oh, right... welcome to the read family reunion.  come on in.  dad planned party games, so get ready for fun, fun, fun.  son, fun is my middle name and i
