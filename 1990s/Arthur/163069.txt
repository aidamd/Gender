  it's a simple message and it comes from the heart    believe in yourself    for that's the place to start    and i say hey.   hey.   what a wonderful kind of day    if we could learn to work and

be something i can do.  hey.       .  i thought you wanted the bride and groom on the cake.  please go play, d.w.  i was just trying to help.  your nose looks shiny, aunt jessica.   .  oops.  i was just trying to help.   you need some more shaving cream, uncle richard.  is this the button.  what.   i was just trying to...   thank you.  hmm.  the flowers are here.  a boutonniere for arthur...

from everybody.  okay, say...  ugh.  are you lost, little girl.  no. i'm not little, and i'm not lost.  mom: come on, d.w.  it's time to sit down.  aunt lucy, next time you get married, can i help.     when i get married i'll tell anybody who wants to help they can.  remember, if you make a mistake you'll ruin the wedding so watch it.   here comes arthur.  he doesn't look very happy.  he's talking to himself.  : not too fast, not too slow...  smile.  whoa.       wow.  grandpa: okay, all right.  don't have a conniption.  it's under control.  just got to do a little fishing.  oops.  kind of stuck here.  let's see here.  anybody got a little bear grease.  i think i can wiggle out.  whoa.  if someone can fit in here...  let me try.   sorry, arthur, you're too big.  cora, maybe you could give her a shot.   no way, it's dirty in there.  can't they just get another ring.  that's right, cora.  don't worry, you don't have to go into that filthy organ.  what's happening.   woman: i've never heard anything like it.  that's terrible.  d.w.: how about me.  i can do it.  that a girl, d.w..  please hold this, arthur.   uhoh.          the ring.   hmph.  d.w., you carry the ring.  you found it, you deserve it.  but... she...  cora...  oh, all right.   i now pronounce you husband and wife.  you may kiss the bride.   thank you, d.w.  we couldn't have done it without you.   all: goodbye.  good luck.  see you later.  best wishes.  if you lose anything, just call me.   kids: and now...  um, d.w.'s trying to help.  every time she wants to do something they tell her, "you're too little to do it." d.w. got the ring because she was small.  d.w. was so small that she can go back there and get the ring.  sometimes i feel like d.w.  small people could do big things.  girl: we're talking about all different sizes...  big and small.  boy 1: we're working on a project...  boy 2: to write about what you can do when you're big and small.  things you could dowhen you're small and big.  i am small enough to get a piggyback.  big enough to ride my new bike.  i am small enough to hide under my bed.  i am big enough to reach the refrigerator to get something to eat.  i am small enough to be scared of the dark.  small enough for a bedtime story.  big enough to clean my room.  big enough to wear perfume.  small enough to play with my small friend.  big enough to hang on the monkey bars.  small enough to curl up in a ball.  big enough to jump high.  small enough to get my face painted.  i am big enough to have a job.  and now...  sometimes my dad gets excited about some pretty weird stufflike the fatherson fisherman's sunrise breakfast.  remember, it's allyoucaneat so don't stop until you're full.  i'm full.  that wasn't the only thing.  dad's always getting me into strange activitieslike the dental hygiene choir.   floss, floss, floss your teeth    make your mouth feel clean.    gargle and spit, gargle and spit...    to prevent gingivitis    and other forms of periodontal disease.    it gets worse because after that, i was trapped in...  the cleanup brigade.    i'm not a wuss.  you're the wuss.  no, you are.  i've got it.  now extend your arm slowly and feel the power of the ch'i.  i've got it.  arthur. stop.  it's not that deep.  we could get it.  .  i'm not going into that toxic waste pit.  this park is so gross.  what ever happened to using trash cans.  some people are such slobs.  the whole world's getting disgusting.  the ocean is full of oil.  people are throwing garbage all over.  it makes me want to do something about it.  like go clean it up ourselves.  well, maybe not us, exactly.  that is a fantastic idea.  it is.  if kids cared about the park maybe adults would, too.  have you seen the park.  it would take an army of kids to clean it up.  an army. good idea.  you could call it the kids' cleanup brigade.  yeah.  well, see you, arthur.  bye, mr. read.  huh.  your idea for a kids' cleanup brigade is terrific.  i'm calling the other parents to sign up their kids.  but...  hello, bitsy.  dave read here.  arthur just came up with a great idea.   now my mom's after me to join this cleanup brigade.  why did you start this.  it was my dad.  sue ellen: arthur.  we need to have a talk.  what about.  my mother signed me up for something called the cleanup brigade which she says is your idea.  it wasn'tsee, my dad...  i'm not giving up wednesday afternoon karate to pick up trash.  whoa.   muffy: arthur, we have to talk.  i'm not touching other people's garbage.  just forget about it.  just the thought is vomitrocious.  home, bailey.  molly: look, it's cleanup boy.  rattles: well, if it isn't captain cleanup.  you got a stain on your shirt, cleanup boy.  aah.  ha, ha. made you look.  that wasn't too bad.  they could've really humiliated you.  francine: psst. arthur.  francine.  we have to talk about this cleanup...  i know, you don't want to do it.  it was my dad's idea.  please don't you yell at me, too.  no, no, i wanted to warn you...  man: hey, hey, the cleanup boy.  my dad.  it's rare to find a young man eager to join the ranks of the sanitation profession.  welcome.  uh...  thanks, mr. frensky.  i thought i could teach you the tricks of the trade.  but i...  no need to thank me.  i'll be by to pick you up later.  my dad can be a bit too...  enthusiastic.  i have exactly the same problem.  yeah. yeah.  arthur: one more.  arthur, are you crazy.  you've been saying that all day.  even i'm tired.  come on...    hi, mr. frensky.  we'll head over to sanitation central first.  i think you'll find it fascinating.  sure.   this place is like a nerve centerour war room.  action, powerit all happens right here.  it doesn't seem very...  um... active.  wow.  how's she running.  recycling's at 70%.  plant b flow is five million gallons an hour.  one lady has a pile of fish bones in her yard.  she says it's fertilizer.  keep me posted.  before we tackle any major project matt designs a computer simulation.  i've asked matt to work something up for your park idea.  want to try.  it depends on how many kids help.  if one kid joins, garbage will keep building up.  but if more kids join...  wow. is that really how it'll work.  there are a few variables but yeah, provided you get the equipment.  matt, do we have any spare uniforms.  no, i don't need a...  let's start with the basics.  this is a rolling fliptop garbage cana c1.  this pointy stick is your parkcleaning tool.  what's it called.  a pointy stick.  oh.  there's one more thing i want to show you.  fremsky: since human civilization began people have pondered the question: who will take out the garbage.  arthur, we sanitation engineers believe that man was put on earth not to pollute the planet but to preserve it to keep it healthy, beautiful and clean.  i... um...  that's my speech.  i'll see you at the park tomorrow at 4:00 with your volunteers.  if there are any volunteers.  here goes nothing.  we're proud of you, arthur.  is buster here.  we're going to the cleanup brigade.  no, buster's not home right now, i'm afraid.  it figures.    francine: i can't, arthur.  i can't believe this.  just forget it, arthur.  you'll never clean it by yourself.  it's impossible.  hey, mom, where should i put this trash.  hurry up, let's go.  thisisimpossible.   at least i can tell dad we tried.  hey, cleanup boy nice outfit.  need some trash to clean up.  what's the matter, captain cleanup.  aren't you going to pick it up.   you're not going to leave that litter there.  that's not doi  come on, leave him alone.  what's going on over there.  don't get involved.  you clean it up.  i'm going home.  come on, pal.   pal.    help.  somebody help.  my dog's choking.  pal.   thank goodness.  i knew there was some reason i went to medical school.  well, guess we'll get going now.  stop.  you guys almost killed my dog with your trash.  enough's enough.  now... who's going to help clean up this park.  what.  who's going to help clean up this park.  no hands. then i'll give you assignments.  molly, you start over there.  but...   all right, all right.  don't have kittens.  now, you two...  what can we do about those papers.  arthur.  are these your volunteers.  well, yeah, i guess they are.  well, there's plenty of stuff.  let's hand it out.  funny, i thought francine said she'd be here.  me, too, but she...  francine: arthur. dad.  sorry i'm late.  i had to track down everyone to be your volunteers.  arthur, i'm sorry i tried to get out of helping you.  i guess i...  what the....  seems arthur has things under control.  but how did you.... how did they....  these guys showed me it's important to keep the park clean.  somebody could choke eating this garbage.   right, binky.  pointy stick.  hey, this is fun.  buster: arthur. i think i found the frisbee.  at pbs kids go dot org you can play games, and share your thoughts and you can also go that's where you go to ..but not regular stuff like
