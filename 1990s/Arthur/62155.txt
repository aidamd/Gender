"oswald, oswald, oswald." that's all you ever talk about.  look, don't you have something better to do than follow me.   um, well, i guess i could go run and hide.  that's a great idea.  so why don't you just...  wait, hide from what.  you don't want to know.  come on.  phew.  what was that.  she's called pretty penny.  if anything gets out of its box, she hunts it down and stuffs it back in.  i better find those drawings quickly.  d.w.: no, no, no.  this is all wrong.  hey, that's d.w..  how'd she get down here.  we're supposed to follow a road.  not a line on the floor.  give me that map.  you're useless.   if we only had brain.   you guys look ridiculous.  why are you dressed like that.  what's wrong with the way i'm dressed.  am i rusty.   just because we're not fashion conscious is no reason to make fun of us.  i wasn't.  oh, forget it.  have you seen any drawings of oswald.  he's my imaginary friend.    what's so funny.  you.  friends with the great and powerful oswald.  never in a million years.  oswald is only friends with kids who have an imagination.   which you don't have.  so you might as well just give up now.  you take that back.  she has a huge imagination.  bigger than all of yours put together.  ah.  it's a tiny stuffed elephant.  run away.  is there anything you're not afraid of.  why couldn't i have gone on a quest with dwarves and elves.  come on, let's find that road before those flying monkeys come back.  thank you for defending me.  hey, what are friends for.  so can we have fun now.  we could find a mud puddle and jump in it.  you can do whatever you like.  i have to find oswald.  boring.   who dares approach oswald.  you're my imaginary friend.   no, i am what replaced him.  you used to play with that imaginary nuisance all the time...  daddy, look.  he's eating cereal with his nose.  i can do that, too.  oswald: then, i arrived in the form of toys, games, gadgets.  and i conquered your imagination.  now you're a mere thing, and must be put in a box.  ah.  put me down.  yeah, put her down, you big, plastic lump.  help. help.  don't worry, muffy.  i'll find you.  i swear.  i don't want to be in a box.  no, no.  no... no...   so sorry for the delay.  oh.  i see you found the right box.  that's right.  he was an elephant and his name was "waldo," not "oswald." it was you.  i should've known.  i'm sorry i called you stinky.   muffy: he was this little pink elephant, and we did everything together.  but i didn't even remember him until just the other day.  cool.  so which explorer do you want to be: illinois jack or penny pithhelmet.  actually, i kind of feel like just taking a walk.  do you mind playing without me.   let's build a snow fort.  no, a snow mall.  and we'll ride ice bicycles to get from one end to the other.  but first, i'm giving you a bath.  you may be imaginary, but you still smell.  huh. that's cologne.  it's called "pachyderme." all the stuffed elephants are wearing it.  she's talking to no one.  do you think she's lost her marbles.  nah.  she's just catching up with an old friend.  and now a word from us kids.  what if we had an imaginary friend.  we're using our imagination to take us around the world and back in time.  we built a time machine.  we are going to travel back in time...  to various places...  ...all over the world.  we're going to egypt.  come join us.  in 332 b.c., alexander the great of greece conquered egypt.  egypt.  we're going to france...  where clowns are called "mimes." the eiffel tower was built for the 1889 world's fair.  you can use your imagination to go anywhere you want.  we're going to rome.  julius caesar was honored after his death.  this is what they used to wear in rome.  we're going to south africa.  one important person is nelson mandela.  he was the president in 1994.  ha.  we're going to china.  a land of great warriors.  hiya.  china is unique because it has the great wall of china.  the great wall of china keeps china safe.  where will your imagination take you.  hawaii, hawaii, hawaii is my state.  when the volcano erupts, the island grows bigger.  bbbbigger.  imagination can take you anywhere.  and now back to arthur.  sometimes i think it would be really great to be invisible.  hey, what happened to all the cookies.  don't look at me.  well, they didn't eat themselves.  francine: mm.  i stand corrected.  francine: you could hear what people were saying about you.  sometimes francine can be really bossy.  you can say that again.   we're late.  whoa.  hey, how did our shoes get tied together like that.  but it could also be bad.  i know because one time, my sister pretended she couldn't see me for a whole week.  can i have a turn.  is it my turn now.  did you hear something.  no.  you guys, please.  my turn.  must have been the wind.  it wasn't very nice.  but now's my chance to get her back.   muffy: your sister likes horses.  why don't you get her a horse for her birthday.  muffy, i can't afford a horse.  plus horses are really hard to wrap.  you could make her a present.  just don't make her clothes.  last year, d.w. made me a hat out of a swim cap and some loofahs.  and my mom made me wear it.  happy birthday, arthur.   hey, arthur.   my dad needs his car washed.  can i use your head.   aw...  plus it gave me this weird rash.  ew.  ew.  well, catherine is turning 16.  whatever i give her has to be perfect.  i've been thinking about this bowling party.  i hope catherine doesn't mind losing to me on her birthday.  franky, your sister and i had a talk today.  and, well, she's a junior in high school now...  i know.  "i'm practically an adult." the thing is, she wants the party to be for her and her friends.  oh, i can stand them for one night.  i mean, she wants it to be onlykids her age.  i don't understand.  it's just for older kids.  i don't understand what you're saying.  you're not invited to the party.  what..  wait, are you saying i'm not invited to the party.  now sweetie, you have to try to be grown up about this.  we'll see about this.  francine...  if you think you can have a party without me, you can eat a slug sandwich.  dad, the third grader got loose.  you know what.  maybe i'll have a party and only cool people can come.  sorry.  ooh, where.  the petting zoo.  cool.  dad, catherine's being ironic.  i'm trying to study.  oliver: francine, leave your sister alone.    franky, stop.  now look, i know this is difficult, but sometimes your sister needs to be around kids her own age.  why is everyone on her side.  friday is your sister's special day.  she's turning 16.  that only happens once.  we all want her to have the kind of day she wants.  one without me, you mean.  if you ask me, you're lucky you're not going.  a bowling party.  with pizza.  ugh.  how boring.  sounds pretty good to me.  me too.  i love pizza.  sh.  oh, uh, no, i mean, i used to love pizza, but it isn't really that good... anymore.  this has to be the meanest thing she's ever done.  and she's done a lot, believe me.  one time, she told me there was a monster that lived in the tub.  francine.  bath time.   no.  what's gotten into her.  francine is apayaso.  what's apayaso.   si, si, muy de payaso.  you guys are about as funny as chicken pox.  ooh, nice one,payaso.  or should i say, "clown."  francine: one time, she invited me to play freeze tag with her friends...  freeze.  hello.  anyone there.    ooh, that mean.  i have to remember that.  you know what.  you should give her a taste of her own medicine so she knows how it feels.  oh, i know.  first, you get a big piece of vieuxboulogne.  what's that.  the stinkiest cheese in the entire world.  when she's not looking, you slip the cheese in the pocket of what she'll be wearing.  when she arrives...   that smell.  ugh.   come back here.   it'll be the worst birthday ever.  where on earth would i get a piece of vieuxboulogne.  i have a whole wheel of it in my room.  a. that's weird.  b. i think she'd notice the smell coming from her pocket.  well, i can't think of everything.  ooh, i know what you should do.  it's perfect.  what.  it's so simple.  the night before the party...   binky: then...  hey everyone, watch this.  ah.    how was the party.  genius, right.  not exactly.  how would the glue stay wet that long.  and how do i know which bowling ball she'd pick.   i have great ideas, but reality always gets in the way.  muffy: you know the real reason she doesn't want you there.  she just wants to be around boys.  "oh, sean." "i love you, sean." oh, wait.  i've got it.  i totally know what you should do.  what.  okay, first, you need a handwriting expert.  perfect.  then, tomorrow night...  this one is for my sister, and the other one is for sean.  he's the one who looks like a rodent.   "meet me in back.  sean." we have visual.  good work.  audio.  check.  all systems go.  going live... now.  catherine: oh, sean.  kiss me.    that's perfect.  only...  only.  i don't think there's a hallway at the bowling alley.  or security cameras.  rats.  but maybe there is a way...  francine frensky, what are you thinking.  wait and see.  wait... and... see.  oliver: go right in, have fun.  sean, hi.    what's he doing now.  is he looking this way.   francine: attention, everyone.  may i have your attention, please.  i hope you're all having a wonderful time at my sister's party.  francine.  where is she..  in honor of this big day, i have something i'd like to read.  what are you doing.  get out of there.  i'm sure you'll enjoy hearing a few meaningful passages from a very special book.  my diary.   now where to begin.  i can't believe it.  so what happened.  did people laugh like crazy.  i'd definitely laugh like crazy.  well, it didn't exactly go the way i planned.  francine: i was feeling pretty great because i remembered all the pranks catherine played on me...  and while i was thinking about those things, i sort of remembered how i felt.  never mind.  happy birthday, catherine.   after all, it was bad enough she had to have a party with her friends.  uh, anything about me in there.  she even said we could go bowling together once i'm done being grounded.  which will be around my16th birthday.  i'm proud of you, francine frensky.  you're so much nicer than me.  i would have totally read it.  well...  wait, you didn't read it, did you.  no, but...    catherine loves sean.     come back here.  ooh.  francine.  wednesday...  that hohum, stuck in the middle day.  wednesday:  anncr: until now.  wednesday: ah.  anncr: all this month, pbs kids is giving your mid week a shake up.  during wild wednesdays. part of summer safari.  featuring new episodes of wild kratts each week.  martin: you don'twant to miss this.  wooahhhhhhh.  anncr: so join the wild krattsfor wild wednesdays...  martin: woohoo.  anncr: ...part of pbs kids' summer safari.  with new episodes every wednesday, all this month.  and check out wild kratts anytime on thepbs kids video app.  when strange...  sabatino:..  ms. o:..  sabatino:..by a table.   vo: call odd squad weekdays on pbs kids or watch anytime onthe pbs kids app which arthur character are you.  she's dw because she's funny.  dw: i'm giving you half a star.  one star is usually the lowest you can get, but i made an exception.  and she's arthur because she's smart.  isn't it great to be appreciated.  we don't argue like dw and arthur do.  yes we do.  this is all your fault.  no we don't.  see, you're just like arthur and dw.  oh, not again.  i guess we are just like arthur and dw.  all: whicharthurcharacter are you.  funding forarthuris provided by: the best time to play is anytime.  chuck e. cheese's isa proud sponsor of pbs kids.  and by contributionsto your pbs station from: buster:to watch morearthur and play games with allthe elwood city friends, visit pbskids.org.  you can findarthurbooksand lots of other books too at your local library.  captioned bymedia access group at wgbh access.wgbh.org )
