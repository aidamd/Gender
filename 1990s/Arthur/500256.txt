hey. how's it goin'.  welcome to buster's cabinet of culinary curiosities.  i'm ray.  i'm tapioca, but you can just call me "puddin'." buster saved a pudding..  why'd he do that.  you're so bland.  uh, i think he liked the way i wiggled.  boy, seems like anybody can get into the collection nowadays.  don't listen to her.  she thinks she's so big because she was from the buffet at la bruncherie.  now she's just bitter fruit.  it was baxter day when buster picked me.  you're just here because you look like argentina.  i've had it with you.  always going on about your potassium.  put up your peels.  um, i hate to interrupt, but does anyone know how long i'll be here.  beats me. i don't know.  i've been on this shelf longer than ray but not as long as duncan.   banana: and no one's been in the cabinet as long as the kernel.   but one thing's for sureyou're safe from the garbage disposal here.  buster loves us.   but... she doesn't.   yuck.  buster: do we have to throw it all away.  can't i keep my twoheaded carrot.  you know the ruleswhen i can smell it, it goes in the trash.  this will be good for our compost bin.  take this to the community garden and see if mr. langley can use it.  mr. langleythat's the weird guy with the big hat who talks to himself, right.  he's not weird.  i've known mr. langley since i was a kid.  besides, he's not the one with a case full of rotting food in his room.   you think you're tougher than me, eh.   you put up a good fight, weed, i'll give you that.   useless mitts.  buster: mr. langley.  at ease, soldier.  ookay.  my mom thought you might be able to use this.  nice texture... well aerated...  what's this..  um, a bottle cap.  you're darn tootin' it's a bottle cap.  compost is organic matter only.  if it looks manmade, don't stick it in here.  make a note of it.  here, give these to your mother.  thanks.  no need to thank me.  they're your tomatoes, too.  this is a community garden, son, even if the "community" doesn't like to do any weeding.  dismissed.  mmm.  you're right.  this is a delicious tomato.  and the best part is, our compost helped grow them.  hey, that one kind of tasted like my yam collection.  and you wanted me to throw those out in december.  bet you're glad i held on to them now.   mmm. this is the best tomato i've ever had.   .  mmm.  this is the best tomato i've ever had.  mmm. the most delectable lycopersicon esculentum i've ever ingested.  huh.  it's the best tomato i've ever had.   buster, i've heard about your tomatoes.  let me represent you.  represent me.  you think i should sell my tomatoes.  not the tomatoes, silly, the tomato productstomato toothpaste, tomato soap, tomato foaming bath gel.  everyone knows the real money is in ketchup.  i kind of like just giving them away.  that's so sweet.  okay, you handle production and distribution.  leave the marketing to me.    mom, could you make sure i'm up by 7:00 tomorrow.  i want to get more tomatoes to give away.  maybe you could bring mr. langley some of those muffins i made today.  okay.  you're such a good boy.  ah, i really am.  spare some change, sir.  our stomachs are seized with peristaltic contractions and our mouths are filled with an excess of saliva.  we're hungry.  a penny..  we can't buy anything with this.  oh, we're doomed.  wait.  look. up in the sky.  it's cat saver.  no, i mean piano tamer...  arthur: no, it's...  arthur and brain: captain pomodoro.  and his dog, ragu.  here you go, boys.  they're made from my own secret compost mixture.  that's why they're so big and juicy.   both: thanks...  captain pomodoro.  come, ragu.  we mustn't tarry.  as long as there is hunger and bland salads in this world, i shall not rest.   both: bye, captain pomodoro.  buster: on plum, on cherry, on beefsteak, on vineripened and heirloom and jersey.    hello. mr. langley.  anybody here.  langley: hold it right there, sticky fingers.  there's a limit on the tomatoes.  just how many did you take.  um, aall of them.  this is a community garden, son.  that means it's for the community, not just you.  i didn't know. i'll put them back.  you can't put them back.  once it's been plucked, you've got to eat it.  what were you planning to do with all these.  open a restaurant.  i was just going to give them away.  here. you can have them.  and these are for you, too.  got to run. bye.   these are tasteless.   once you've had the real thing, it's hard to go back.  why not get more from that community garden.  i can't.  i took too many and the guy who runs it got angry at me.  you could try growing your own.  we grew some herbs in our window boxes.  i bet i'd be a great gardener.  i've already grown mold in my food cabinet.  i think it's a little more difficult than that.  how hard can it be.  the sun and the rain do all the work.  hey, are you through with that sandwich.  yeah. why.  it's for my compost.  i think i'll call you tom.   shoo. shoo.  it's been five days and there isn't even a sign of a tomato.  what did i do wrong.  i don't know, honey, but i think tom may be... gone.  do you want to keep him in your cabinet for a few days.  : no.  mr. langley.  heremore compost.  i already checked for bottle caps.  why are you throwing out this tomato plant.  because it's deadi killed it.  well, the hornworms have gotten to itthat's what made these holes in the leavesand it's been overwatered, but there may still be some life left in her.  him.  i, uh... i named it tom.  tom, huh.  follow me.  that's douglas, george, dwight and mamie.  i could put tom right there if you want.  okay.  shall i put him in now.  hold your horses, bucko.  that hole's not nearly deep enough.  just resting my mitts on account of the arthritis.  oh.  well, let me dig.  much obliged.  my name's buster, by the way, not bucko.  i'm fritz.  buster.  over here.  look. i've already designed our first product"buster's allnatural tomato suntan lotion.  for that fresh feel." and i already managed to sell a bottle.  that's great, but i won't have more tomatoes for several weeks.  but i've already placed orders.  daddy wants three bottles by monday.  sorry, muffy.  tomatoes take a while to grow.  but you could have some bok choyit's a kind of chinese cabbage.  hmm... sounds exotic.  we could do a line of skin toners and antiaging creams.  hey, arthur, have some bok choy.   that'll be $15.  i'm not paying $15 for this.  you didn't expect buster to give it to you for free, did you.  well... yeah.  actually, there's something i'd like in return.  langley: come on, people, put your backs into it.  i want this garden shipshape by 1600.  those are weeds, not puppet strings, professor.  give it some muscle.   attaboy.  buster: fritz.  how's it going.  they're a ragtag bunch of greenhorns who've never stuck their pinkies in a pot of soil, but by golly, i'm going to make them gardeners.  i think this is ready.  mmm.  that's the best tomato sauce i've ever had.  well done, buster.  i can't take all the credit.  after all, they were the garden's herbs and mom prepared it, but i did stir the pot.  baxter companyfall out.  lunch.  : tomato sauce.  why didn't i think of that.  we'll make millions.  it'll be called "buster's own." we'll charge double because it's organic...  buster: here, have some garlic bread.    kids: and now...  we're going to go pick up our tomatoes that we planted last year.  girl: i found one.  this is a potato.  potatoes.   this is the food project.  food project is a place where kids plant their vegetables and they get it and go to the kitchen and they cook it and they make something out of it to eat.  it's a farm in the city.  what do you remember about potatoes.  where do they grow.  under the ground.  girl: in the third grade, we came here from the emerson school and we planted.  now we're back here from the fourth grade to pick our potatoes and next week, we're going to go to the kitchen and cook them to eat.  teacher: they get to touch their food.  they know where it comes from.  they know the effort it takes to grow it.  this is so cool.  teacher: next week, we're going to go and cook these potatoes.  what are we going to make.  roasted red potatoes and applesauce.  child: potato pancakes.  child 2: mashed potatoes.  kids: we are apeeling the potatoes.  woman: here comes the fun partwe get to put our hands in it and mix it all up together.  you guys mixed it really well.  this is good.  teacher: by coming to the kitchen, they really get an appreciation of an art to loving to create their own food and enjoying it.  this is how you make applesauce.  kids: wow.  we need to always go...  and see what we think it needs.  and no doubledipping.  girl: i think it's perfect.  no, i think we need some cinnamon.  no.  teacher: food is not ju out of thbox. it's coming straight from you.  and now...  okay, everybody, it's friday, and that means it's time for the...  class: good behavior award.  one of you was especially well behaved this week, and for that you get...   timmy...  tommy... behave.  both: he did it.  both: tibbles.  ms. morgan: the winner gets their picture on the bulletin

 wow. thanks.  don't mention it.  good night.  wait a minute...    both: he did it.  uhoh...  timmy: wow, tommy, you were even better at getting that timeout from grandma than at school.  emily: here, d.w.  timmy: okay, time to wreck the castle.  d.w.: stop right there, young man.  this is my replacement cupcake.  i just want to ask you something.  frisk him, emily.  he's clean.  what is it.  can

good.  emily: yeah.  who's next, timmy.   hmm...  well, hello, ladies.  and how are you doing this fine day.  shall we escort you to school.  why, girls, you look cold.  timmy.  you're right, no one

 what would you give me if i could do it.  if you can get a tibble to win the good behavior award, i'll do all your snacktime cleanups for a month.  so i'm going to get a cupcake..  ifyou get the good behavior award, which means ifyou're good at school, which means ifyou pay attention to my lessons.  chocolate cupcake.  i hate vanilla.  these are gummi slugs.  every time you do something good, you
