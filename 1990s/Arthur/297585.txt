  : hi.  i'm arthur.  duh...  and this is my doggiewoggie, pal.  he's so smart.  he does amazing tricks.  watch.  pal, sit.  lie down.  good doggie, pal.  i found my glasses, mom.  d.w. took them.  d.w.: i'm not d.w.  i'm arthur.  duh...  give me back my glasses.  mom.  i'm arthur and some tiny thing happened so right away i'm calling for help.  whoa.  what were you doing.  proving that i could be arthur.  i can do anything you can do.  oh, yeah.  i bet you can't do thismy math homework.  ha. i win.   i sat on my dog.     d.w.: throw it back.  like this, kate.  no.  try it again.  i feel so alone sometimes.   a tongue touched my nose.  aah.  buster: best book in the series isthe general.  nah, i liked the specificbetter.  andthe randomwas so unpredictable.  what are you talking about.  nothing that would interest you.  we're talking about books.  i like books.  arthur: the "vegemorph" books make the "scare your pants off" books look like kid stuff.  i just read the trilogy: part one. part one, part two. and part one, part three.  you can't read it.  no pictures.  do you realize i've found something i can do that d.w. can't force me to include her in on.  this is probably the greatest moment of my life.  i don't want to read those dumb books anyway.  don't want to.  you can't read.  i don't need to read.  i can make up better stories than those.  oh, yeah.  yeah.  oh, yeah.  yeah.  oh, yeah..  prove you can do better.  write a story.  okay, i will.  oh, yeah.  yeah.  well, i'm out of here.  this shows no sign of ending soon.  oh, yeah.  yeah.  arthur: there you go.  write your story.  i'll showyou.  i don't know how to write.  if you can't write you're wrong, right.   then he laughed at me and said i didn't know how to write which is true.  brothers are so mean.  i know what it's like.  i had three older brothers.  i bet one arthur is as bad as any three brothers.  more cookies, please.  d.w., you don't have to be able to write to tell stories.  : you don't.  a long time ago, stories weren't written down.  they weren't.   grandma: stories were told out loud.  d.w.: like television.  grandma: no.  these stories excited your imagination and filled you with wonder.   grandma: and when you heard a good story, you'd pass it on...    grandma: it was done without computers or expensive equipment and without even writing them down.  hmm...  d.w.: i don't have to know how to write.  i can tell a story out loud.  that's how they used to do it.  hmm, she's right.  hey, you should tell the story of how i got pal...  nobody cares.  this is my story.  a long time ago, a brave warrior had traveled far away...  and she really wanted to get home bad.  and this warrior was a queen named "od.w.eus." but the sea got made rough by poseidon who was really mad at the queen.   what did i do.   d.w.: the queen forgot she took poseidon's prettiest unicorn.   how'd that get there.  why don't i get to have a unicorn.  i'm a queen and everything.  it's not fair.    od.w.eus: whoohoo.  we're doing it.  poseidon's wave can't hurt us...  but big rocks can.    we survived, but our queen is nutty.  don't you hate it when you get water in your ear.  there's a good joke here about her being crabby.  but i'm not saying it.  the queen ordered her crew to help search the island to find a way home because nothing was more important to any of them than going home.  man, am i hungry.  here, try these.  just as the queen was about to eat the strange flowers...  what's the big deal about going home, anyway.  he's right.  why did we want to go home.  and who are you.  the weird plants they ate gave them am...  amknee...  it made them forget everything.  the queen ran back to the beach, but she was too late.  they'd all eaten the weirdo plants and now they didn't want to go home or do anything worth doing.  oh, this is bad.  then it got worse.  the queen found out that this was...  cyclops island.   cyclops brought them to his cave for lunch and i meanforlunch, because he'd eat anything.  we were going somewhere.  i wish i could remember where.    tommyus: is this where we were going.  must be.  well, i'm going to take a nap.  travel always makes me tired.  the queen had a smart plan to escape the cyclops.  cyclops: hey.  an eclipse.  hey, cyclops.  everyone's squeezing out under the big boulder.   they won't get away.  the queen and her crew got in cyclops's rowboat which was just the right size to be their ship.  cyclops was too dumb to untie his ear so he couldn't stop them.   i'm bad with knots.  that's why i don't wear sneakers.  the queen reminded the crew they had to go home and they all said, "oh, yeah," and remembered.  but the way home was full of dangers including the sirens who played music that "hippotizes" you so you'll crash your boat on their rocks.  man:  crazy bus, crazy bus    riding on a crazy bus...   that music.  i must go to that music.  don't go there, queen.  you'll crash the boat.  but it's so beautiful.  man:  crazy bus...    sloppy, sloopy, gloppy, gloopy...   they had to tie the queen to the mast until they passed the sirens' spellbinding song.  it's the most beautiful music i've ever heard.   crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy bus.   but the worst danger was the last.  they had to sail between a cranky monster and a "swirlpool" named...  scylla and charybdis.  arthur: you can't say "whirlpool" but you can say those big names.  d.w.: quiet. it's my story.  don't you eventhink about coming onto my property.    somebody's old sock.  how rude.   they were happy.  they got past all the monsters and they were almost home but... oh, yeah, they got hit by a thunderbolt before they got there.   after so many years, the queen was finally home.  i made it.  i'm home.  the first thing she did was run to tell her friends all about her adventures...  because that's a good way to tell a storyby telling it, like this.  the end.  good story, huh.  nonobody fought crime with mutant potato powers or anything.  that proves you can't make up a good story.  no, it proves you don't know what's a good story.  grandma told me that story.  it's called "the odyssey." it's from long ago and people still read it.  i changed it a little to test you.  now i know when you tell me i'm no good you're probably just as wrong about that as you are about this.  oh, what does she know.  buster.  hey, d.w., i liked that story.  would you tell me part of it again.  tell the part about charybdis.  not... that i really care.  okay.  a long time ago, there was a warrior.  start with the cyclops.  he's the best.  he eats everything.  the cyclops had only one eye right in the middle of his face and lived in a cave...  and he ate stuff.  he ate everything.   and now a story from me, franceska.  once there was a little girl who grew up in the woods.  she was lost in the woods when she was just a baby.  she understood what the animals said.  next, she started telling the animals stories every day.  they called her "storyus." she told the animals fantastic stories.  when she told her stories she showed the animals what she was talking about.  she used props.  storyus took the animals to natural places.  they visited the bay.  they also visited a forest with gigantic trees and a river with rushing water as fast as a race car.  the animals didn't really know where storyus came from.  when she was a baby, her mother would take her on trips to meet animals in the forest.  one day, when she was riding in her jeep the baby girl fell out in a soft spot in the woods.  the baby girl was lost.  throughout the years, the mother missed her baby.  but one day, when storyus was traveling she accidentally walked right out of the forest and into the city.  all of sudden, she walked into her mother.  she recognized her daughter.  they lived together and storyus's mother sent her to school.  of course, storyus did go to school and some people say she's still telling stories in her thirdgrade class.  kids: and now...   even when it's hard work it's fun to give birthday presents to thine friends...  especially when thou knowest they're going to love it.  ow. my foot, my foot...

do it.  she can't hear you.  she can't hear me but i can get hit with a soccer ball.  what kind of rules are those.  i don't make the news, i just report it.  you'll clean my side of the room for a
