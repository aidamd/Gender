 just a minute, francine.  it's sue ellen's turn.  oh, no.   yeehaw.  francine: look at this team.  what a joke.  there's no drive, no desire...  practice hasn't even started yet.  we're supposed to be goofing around.  mr. crosswire: today we're going to start with the eyesontheball drill.  in this drill, we sharpen our focus by keeping our...  francine: eyes on the ball.  that's right. and...  excuse me, coach.  i think we covered eyesontheball in kindergarten.  mr. crosswire: that's what fundamentals arethe things you learn first and practice the rest of your life.  and today we're focusing on fundamental number onethe balland keeping our eyes on it.  let me hear you now.  eyes on the ball.  fern, arthur, binky, buster: eyes on the ball.  eyes on the ball. eyes on the...  girl: hey.  i saw you playing soccer... well, trying to, anyway.  you've got some really good moves.  yeah. thanks.  you guys do a lot of basic drills.  there's nothing wrong with that.  but you seem more advanced.  ever hear of the soccer league.  the travel teams. sure.  i'm on one of them: the elwood city allstars.  we're having tryouts this saturday.  check it out.  francine: thanks.  yes..  francine: brain.  brain: hi.  francine: isn't this unbelievable.  did you see some of the stuff they're doing.  it's great.  and best of all, no...  both: "eyes on the ball".  go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.  not badnext.  we'll let you know.  those kids are really good.  think we'll make it.  wow.  yeahwow.  pretty cool, huh.  muffy: i'll sayit almost feels like silk.  can you get me one.  they're for allstar players only.  you should see the teams we play against.  montvale, belmont, wayuga.  you get to go everywhere.  you're going to be on two soccer teams and one of them travels.  when will you have time for homework.  um... we're not going to be on two teams.  a lot of the practices conflict.  oh.  but we'll never forget you guys.  it's just time for brain and i to take our game to the next levelyou understand.  have a good time, kids.   new guy.  yeah, you.  in line here.  barrettes.  yes, sir.  on the left.  try to keep up, guys.   tag the line.  and back.   barrettes, you going to make it.  that's what i like to seemental toughness.  okay, everybody, two laps to cool down.  this cup feels like it's a hundred pounds.  i know.  who knew it was such a long way to the next level.  hey, guyspretty intense, huh.  both: you said it. you bet.  coach: teamjordan has decided to leave the team.  he has... other commitments.   there's nothing wrong with other commitments.  better to realize that now than later.  i want this team to give 110%.  are you ready to give me that.  allstars: yes, sir.  coach: good.  i've scheduled an extra practice this thursday.  here are reminder notes for your parents.  both: we're not quitters.  mr. ratburn: let's settle down, people.  we have some announcementsalan.  i'm not going to be president of the computer club anymore.  i don't have the time.  but who's going to head up the club.  not to worry.  i will be your new driver on the information superroadway.  we won't gigabyte off more than we can chew.   i'm sorry.  mr. frensky: i'm a little surprised there's practice today.  coach raggett only cancels for lightning.  your old team canceled for rain.  what if someone slips.  my old team wasn't going to take me to the next level.  mr. frensky: what happens thereyou play during blizzards.  francine: dad.  whoohoo. way to go, brainexcellent pass.  coach: new guy.  there was a better pass on your other side.  see the whole field, people.  i still thought that was pretty good.   the passing is getting sloppy, people.  we've go to work on the giveandgo.  rae, helgademonstrate.  good.  barrettes, new guyyou try it.  wake up those tootsies, barrettes.  you got to give, then go, go, go.   break anything, barrettes.  then on your feet.  this isn't a spa.  teamlittle talk.  next game's a scrimmage, thank goodness.  we've been invited by coach crosswire over at lakewood to play his team.   rae : we better schedule some extra practices.  they're not that bad.  barrettes is right.  anyway, it doesn't matter how bad they are.  i still want you to give 110%.  is that clear.  allstars: yes, sir.  goodline up for sprint relays.  francine: we'll cream them.  this is one game i'm not looking forward to winning.  that's not all i'm not looking forward to.  but you're not thinking of quitting, are you.  no, are... you.  ratburn: and this webbed spot will tell you the temperature in any city in the world.  oh, noit disappeared.  what have i done.  brain: the computer went to sleep.  just move the mouse or hit a key to wake it up.  fascinating.  why don't you join us,please.  i can'ti have soccer practice.  ratburn: let's try something a little simpler.  now, this button is called the "shift key." coach raggett: team, little talk.  lakewood is two players short.  ordinarily this is a default situation.  but we've come all this way and we want to demonstrate our superior might, right.  allstars: right.  so we're going to loan them two players.  new guy, barrettessee you after the game.   come on, focus.  francine: buster.  muffy : all right, buster.  you almost had it.   nice try.  you, too.  what are we waiting for..  good eye, binky.  just figure out your options.  give and go, brain.  both: what a move.   okay, team, we'll debrief before we head back.  terrific game, teamjust terrific.  but we lost 31, daddy.  so. you actually scored on the elwood city allstars.  you played like a finely tuned machine.  and that calls for a little highoctane fuel.  pizza and ice cream.    i think you two are wanted across the field.  it was really great having you two back for a game.  things just haven't been the same since you quit.  wait a second.  we made a pact never to quit, right.  right.  well, we already broke it.  we broke it when we quit themour real team.  so you're saying that quitting the allstars wouldn't be quitting.  it would actually be renewing our dedication to a previous commitment.  uh... yeah.  with pizza.  mr. crosswire: pair up, everybody.  this giveandgo drill is a beauty.  so coach raggett didn't mind letting you go.  he said he loses three kids a season on average, so we were right in line with the numbers.  i also told him the computer club was going to dissolve unless i took it over again.  well, kids, it just goes to show you: sometimes you quit when you win, and sometimes you win when you quit.  and now...  hi, my name is alex.  today we're going to play dodge ball.  this is recess, and we just play on our own.  girl: we're just playing for the fun of it.  everybody gets to play and have fun.  we're going to show you how we organize a good game of dodge ball.  we're going to pick teams and play fair.  boy: heads or tails.  i call heads.  it's tailsjames picks first.  i'll pick david.  becca.  markus. michael.  tori. billy.  kyle.  victoria. ben.  jakira. andrew.  daryll. jill.  farizdaq. elaine.   alex: there are two teams.  and there's the line where you put the balls between the cones.  and when you say "go" or "dodge ball," the teams have to run up to the middle line, get the balls, and throw it on each other.  if it hits them, then they're out, and if you get everyone out, you win.  does everybody get it.  group: yeah.  everyone got to play, because it's just playing at school.  it's not any big thing.  james went over the line...  well, part of his foot did.  we kids just pretty much did this on our own.  girl: everybody got to be in the game, not just some people.  that's important, because if you leave kids out, that'll make them feel bad.  it will make you feel bad, too.  and now...  kids: . there was an old lady who swallowed a goat .  . just opened her throat and swallowed a goat .  . she swallowed the goat to catch the dog .  . she swallowed the dog to catch the cat .  . she swallowed the cat to catch the bird .  . she swallowed the bird to catch the spider .  . that wriggled and jiggled and wiggled inside her .  . she swallowed the spider to catch the fly .  . but i don't know why she swallowed that fly .  . perhaps she'll die. .  . there was an old lady who swallowed a horse .  kids: . she died, of course. .   teacher: wasn't that fun, boys and girls.  okay, everyone, time for a nap.  find your places.  emily: i don't understand that song.  why did the old lady swallow a horse.  to catch the goat.  to catch the dog, to catch the cat, to catch the bird, to catch the spider, that wriggled...  yeah, i know all that.  but why'd she swallow the fly in the first place.  that's gross.  i don't knowi'd eat a fly covered in chocolate.  would not.  would, too.   emily, people do all sorts of strange things for no reason at all.  look at those guys.     higher, james.  come on, put some muscle into it.  hold it.  hey, this is pretty.  timmy and tommy: let me see.  give me it.  give me.  that's mine, let go of it.   hand it over.  that's mine.  no, it isn't.  i... i dropped it earlier.  you did.  well, where'd you get it.  mariehlne gave it to me.  she, um... she brought it back with her on her trip to france.  it's called a "shayval." that's french for "ball." okay.  d.w.: hey...  maybe mariehlne has another "shayval"for me.  i'll ask her about it when she picks you up from school today.   emily: um, you know, mariehlne may not be able to talk to you, d.w.  she's really, really busy.  oh, this won't take long.   .  mom, can we just wait one minute.  sorry, honey, i've got yoga class in 15 minutes.   there's mariehlne.  got to go.  see you, d.w.  man : doctor, will she be all right.  doctor: she'll live.  but we've discovered something, shelby.  kara is your twin sister.    i'll get it.  stay here and tell me what happens.  hi, emily.  is mariehlne at home.  um... yeah.  but you can't come in.  why not.  because... because...  she's sick.  she is.  emily: yeah, really sick.  the doctor said it might be something called...  um, halitosis.  emily: it's very dangerous.   i may be getting it, too.  but come on in, if you want.  just try not to breathe too much.   um... that's okay.  i have to go home...  right now. me, too.  here. get well.  mariehelene: emily, who is there.  it's just d.w.  i've got it.  don't get up.  you need your rest.  poor mariehlne.  got to run.  hmm.  where is d.w..  didn't you invite her in.  oh, she was in a rush.  she just stopped by to give me these.  want some ice cream on this.     d.w.: i just know she's lying.  i mean, who eats ice cream when they're sick.  ido.  so do you.  everyone does.  that's true.  okay, maybe it was the way she was scooping itlike she had something to hide.  maybe mariehlne really is sick.  of courseyou would defend her.  you are a snowball thief.  aha.  there's your proof.  what.  what am i looking at.  sit here, emily.  how are you feeling.  are you feeling better.  you seemed really sick yesterday.  um... yeah, much better.  i...  took some medicine.  hah.  you're lying.  d.w.: oh, tommy.  you ruined the trap.  you have to wait until she says mariehlne is still sick. )
