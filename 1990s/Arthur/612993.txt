has an original point of view     and i say, hey  hey.   what a wonderful kind of day    if you can learn to work and play    and get along with each other    you got to listen to your heart, listen to the beat    listen to the rhythm, the rhythm of the street    open up your eyes, open up your ears    get together and make things better by working together    it's a simple message, and it comes from the heart    believe in yourself  believe in yourself   for that's the place to start  place to start  and i say, hey hey.  hey. what a wonderful kind of day  if you can learn to work and play    and get along with each other  hey. what a wonderful kind of day  hey. what a wonderful kind ofday.  hey.  arthur :.  d.w.: hey.  whoa.   have you ever noticed how different people have different senses of time.  like d.w.  sometimes she thinks a minute is like an hour.  are we there yet.  d.w., that's the eighth time you've asked.  you can't ask again for at least ten minutes.   okay.  are the ten minutes up yet.    then there's buster time, which is closely linked to his stomach.  i'll have the harry mills meatball experience.  buster, it's only 9:00 in the morning.  it's breakfast time.  i've already had breakfast. this is lunch.  but if you have lunch now, you'll be really hungry by dinner.  not if i have dinner at lunch.  and tonight, ew. i'll get a head start on tomorrow's breakfast.  i'm just a meal ahead of you.  mmm, pickles.  sometimes it seems like time is going really fast.  like when you go to an amusement park with all your friends and the day just flies by and everything's over before you know it.  you have ten minutes to complete this test.  sometimes it goes really slowly, : like when you take a test and don't know the answers.  but there's one thing that never changes about time.  you can't stop it.  or can you.  is it working.  i don't know how long i...    yeah.   all: beach.   aw, red flag.  that means we can't swim because the ocean's too rough.  i'm sure it'll change in a little bit.  buster: well, anything yet.  no, she's just... wait a minute.  she's reaching for something green.  oh, false alarm.  it was just a handkerchief.  when is the flag going to change.  you said it would be a little bit.  it's been hours.  what if it's like this forever because of all the green mouse gases in the atmosphere.  it's "greenhouse" gases, buster.  oh. is that where the green mice live.  this is a terrible vacation.  why couldn't we go to paris, like emily.  you know what i used to do when i couldn't swim.  build a sandcastle.  once, we built one as big as a bed.  it was even in the newspaper.  okay, but arthur has to dig.  i don't like sand under my nails.  come on. who knows.  we might find some buried treasure.  okay, we'll put the princess' bedroom here, and her swimming pool here.  oh, and don't forget the stables for the unicorns.  d.w., this is not going to be a fairy princess castle.  yeah, it's dark bunny's ice fortress.  but it's all sand.  it should be the citadel on saturn from episode 38.  but that was destroyed in episode 112.  hey, let's do something from episode 331.  you mean, "the cave of crabman".  buster: no, no, "dr. origami's paper palace." remember those terrifying swans.  fine, we can build whatever you want.  let's just start.             lifeguard: it's a green flag.  you can go in now.  uh, let's just finish this tower.  okay. okay.  here, i found some more doors.  come on, kids, time to go.  just a sec.  i've got to feed the seahorse.  grandma thora: sweet petunia.  that is one of the best sandcastles i have ever seen.  what should we call it.  princess misty's mermaid mansion.  arthur/buster: no.  hey, look.  we could call it the starfish enterprise.  enterprise.. i can't even say that word.  you just said it.  well, i don't like it.  i say we call it castle starfish.  okay, castle starfish it is.    arthur.  uh. yeah.  d.w., what are you doing up.  it's the middle of the night.  i couldn't sleep.  grandma snores.  well, here, you can borrow my earplugs.  now go to bed.  i've been thinking of what we should add to castle starfish.  princess misty needs a guesthouse for the pony.  it's not a princess castle.  anyway, it'll probably be gone by tomorrow.  why.  because the tide will have come in and washed it away.  what's a tide.  it's the movement of the ocean.  at certain times of the day, the water comes farther up the beach.  take my word for it.  that castle is just a heap of sand now.   ha. see, mr. pessimister.  it's a miracle.  it's not a miracle, buster.  we must've built it right above the high tide mark.  but i chose the spot.  and i didn't even know what a tide was.  she's got a point.  see. some people see the glass as half full.  other people just have glasses.  we should make the moat bigger, just in case the tide comes in farther.  come on. let's get started.  there. when we get home, we'll download it onto the computer.  well, time to wash up for dinner.  we'll be right there.  there's something i have to do first.  what are you doing.  giving half of my lemonade to the ocean, as an offering, so it won't destroy the castle.  d.w.: here.  and have a cookie.  d.w., that's littering.  i know a much better way we can protect castle starfish.   there, now it's safe.   citizens of castle starfish, as your king, i am pleased to announce that construction of our new moat is complete.   and as your other king, i hereby reinstate casual fridays.  snails may go to work without wearing their shells.    what's he saying.   uhhuh.   oh.   hmm.   i haven't a clue.  fetch the seahorse whisperer.   d.w.: uhhuh.   yeah, then what.  you don't say.  okay, good job, sea biscuit.  there's a tidal wave headed this way.  arthur: everybody, get to the shelters.  this is not a drill.  quick. to the control tower.   it's getting closer.  d.w.: what's taking you guys so long.  it's stuck. wait.  i see the problem.  whoops. arthur:, i told you not to litter.  arthur: we did it.  we're saved.   : arthur. arthur.  buster: arthur.  arthur. arthur.  huh. you better come quick.  d.w.: it's almost all gone.  i knew i should have given all my lemonade.  oh, i'm so selfish.  we'll fix it.  what..  but there's nothing left to fix.   we need somethin taller than this.  and we'll need to dig a deeper moat.  come on.  we don't have much time.  we're going home today.  we can't leave the castle like this.   no, it won't.   arthur: judging from the picture, castle starfish would have been...  right here.  it wasn't this far from the lifeguard chair.  it was that way.  no, it was here.  it's the back of princess misty's throne.  that could be any old shell, d.w.  and it wasn't a princess castle.  maybe it was over there.  that sand kind of looks familiar.    come on, kids, it's chilly.  i don't want any of you starting school with a cold.  i guess we'll never know exactly where it was.  at least we have a record of it.  yeah.  it was a pretty good summer, wasn't it.  good summer..  are you kidding.  it was the best summer.   you're in them, you shoot them    you make them, it's "postcards from you"   buster: and now, a video from you.   it's "postcards from you."   this "postcard from you" was made by kyler and benjamin in atlanta, georgia.  he's benjamin thomas.  he's kyler hart and we're from atlanta, georgia.  and we're trying out for the drew charter school golf team.  benjamin: all we're doing today is practicing golf.  waiting to hit some good shots, and hope we have a good day.  first thing you do, you put your hand right herethis is an interlocking grip.  you put your pinkie right here on your first finger and then that's how you hit this ball.  kyler: ooh, tough shot.  when you miss, you keep trying till you get it in the hole.  don't get discouraged.  just keep trying.  buster: our next postcard comes from kids at the edmunds academy in des moines, iowa.    the steel drums are from trinidad.  these drums are special to us because the actual creator made them out of 55gallon oil containers.  buster:to see more "postcards from you," visit: to see more postcards from you, visit: pbskids.org   buster: oops.  what.  aw, don't worry, it's fine.  five second rule.  i never eat anything after it's been on the floor more than five seconds.   or is it the ten second rule.  i forget.   do any of you have a friend like this.  a friend who's just a little... sloppy.   see you in class.  one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, tenready or not, here i come.   bitzi: buster, are you taking your bath.  just finishing, mom.  what do you do.  do you tell them.  ah, ah, ah...   ew. ew.  gross. buster. buster.  i mean, don't you haveto tell them.  hey.  hey, buster's annual pool party is this weekendare you going.  shh.  "meeting after school at the sugar bowl.  don't tell buster."  arthur: sorry i'm late.  what's this all about.  why wasn't i supposed to tell buster.  this is about buster.  and since you're late, we'll tell you what we've all decided.  you are going to tell buster that he's got to clean up his act and stop being so disgusting all the time.  what.  just tell him to stop eating food off the floor.  wash his hands once in a while.  cover his mouth when he sneezes.  all: stop hiding in garbage cans.  oh, well...  why don't you tell him.  because you're his best friend.  he'll listen to you.  but... just tell him if he keeps it up, he's going to get sick.  tell him if he doesn't stop it, i won't come to his pool party this weekend.  sue ellen: tell him...  duck.  not you, arthur.  go out there and tell him.  oh, wow, somebody threw away a harmonica. arthur: buster, wait a minute.  hey, buster, there's something i, uh...  wanted to tell you.  did buster just take a harmonica out of the garbage.  shh, i think arthur's telling him.   did you tell him.  what'd he say. is he going to do it.  i think so.  he smiled and said, "uhhuh." whew. i'm glad that's over with.   is that what i think it is.  okay, plan b.   oh, hey, arthur.  you know, maybe i didn't mention yesterday, there's these things called "germs." germs haven't hurt me yet.  well, haven't you ever been sick.  you're staying home from school today, buster.  yeah.  okay, wrong question.   well, you may not care about germs, but you're probably passing them on to us.  what germs, arthur.  i don't see them, do you.  how do we know they even exist.  oops.   oh, don't worry about it, francine.  it's just a little pudding.  it still works fine.   any ideas for plan c.  we can still say we won't come to his pool party.  that's sure to work.  but that would crush him.  there's one other thing we can try.  buster: those are germs.  yep, they're hardy microscopic organisms capable of carrying tons of diseases.  don't they look just like aliens waiting to attack.  i don't know.  they look more like multivitamins.  no. wild rice.  good night, mom.  good night, wild rice.   wild rice.  oh, just germs.  brain told me they're on everything that isn't washed.  well, they're not on my buster 'cause he's clean as a whistle.   hmm...  hey, buster, come on in.  how did this get in here.             mmm. you smell very clean this morning, buster.  hi, buster.  hey, i've got something to show you.  : you do.  yeah, i...  are you wearing hockey gloves.  uh, yeah. i, um, my hands get cold sometimes.     so, i got this really cool book on botulism to show you.   are you okay.   i'll meet you in class.   oh, no. now i have to wash my whole mouth.  buster, please take your seat.  now, when we multiply fractions, we multiply the two numerators, then we multiply the two denominators, and then divide those two products, like so.  any queson uh, mr. ratburn, how many germs are there in this school.   well, that's not exactly a math question.  but i suppose there could be thousands on that pencil in your mouth.   see, buster, it's not so hard being clean.  uh...   don't you feel better.    you know, buster, you don't have to bethatclean.  well, are there germs or aren't there.  okay, then.  you know, buster, there are good germs as well as bad.  we couldn't digest our food if we didn't have bacteria inside us, breaking it down.  they're already inside of me..  excuse me, i got to go wash my hands.  great, now you've turned your best friend into a nervous wreck.  yeah, and you've probably ruined a perfectly good pool party.  huh.  are you sure we can't call everybody and cancel.  buster, we rented all this stuff and sent out invitations.  i wish you'd tell me what's got you so worried.   uh, nothing.    i'll get it.  all: pool time.  not yet. shower first.  why do i have to take a shower.  shower. what's he talking about.  hands.  aren't you going to come outside and swim with us.  just watching everyone have fun is enough for me.   i'm starting to miss that harmonica.  something's got to be done about this.  don't look at me.  fine. girls.  okay, buster, here's the deal.  we don't want you to be slobby, but we don't want you to be a nervous wreck, either.  we just want you to be like us.  so come out here and have some fun.   don't touch me.  iamhaving fun.  i just don't want to touch anything.   germs. germs.    i'm okay.  i'm... okay.  see. we told you you were being crazy.  hmm.  i guess that was kind of mean, huh.    hmm.  we all pitched in and got you something, buster.  to say we were sorry.  we're real sorry.  yeah, us, too. yeah. that's right.  we don't care if you're slobby or afraid of germs.  you can be what you want to be.  we just want to stay friends with you.  really. aw, thanks.  i'm sorry, too.  i guess i got a little carried away.  i was seeing germs everywhere.  theyareeverywhere, buster.  but good hygiene does keep the bad ones under control.  yeah.  open your present.  a new harmonica.  a clean one.   uh, just to be safe.   which arthur character are you.  she's dw because she's funny.  dw: i'm giving you half a star.  one star is usually the lowest you can get, but i made an exception.  and she's arthur because she's smart.  isn't it great to be appreciated.  we don't argue like dw and arthur do.  yes we do.  this is all your fault.  no we don't.  see, you're just like arthur and dw.  oh, not again.  i guess we are just like arthur and dw.  all: whicharthurcharacter are you.  something kids strange things happen
