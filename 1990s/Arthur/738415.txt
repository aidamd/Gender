 et along  and get along with each other.   hey.   what a wonderful kind of day    hey. what a wonderful kind of day.   hey.  arthur: hey, d.w.  hey.  whoa.    buster: almost.  just one more pull.  buster, your father's on the phone.  i'll be right there.  whenever buster's dad calls buster drops everything to talk to him.  his parents got a divorce when he was four and now he only sees his dad a couple of times a year.  his dad writes a lot and sometimes they go on trips together and buster always brings back something...  interesting.  this is half the sandwich from the flight to mexico.  it's hamorjamonin spanish.  this is a candy wrapper from hong kong.  mmm...  you can still taste the radishes.  arthur: but sometimes i wonder if buster's sad his dad isn't around.  buster: whoowee.  this is going to be the best father's day ever.  is your dad coming.  no.  will you visit him.  nope.  so what's so great.  i can't tell you.  you'll just have to wait and see.  something smells fishy here...  and it's not just thejamon.  is sunday.  arthur: there it is in black and whitethe father's day picnic is this sunday.  i've been dreading it for a week.  but i thought you loved the picnic.  sure, i do, but buster doesn't.  last year he didn't even show up.  probably his dad was away and he wouldn't have had a partner for the games.  the egg toss would have been a killer all alone.   here you go, buster.  oh... i got it, buster.  aw, you didn't have to throw it so hard.  or maybe he was afraid someone would find out his parents are divorced.  man: hello, buster.  how about some haney burgers for you and your...  wait a minutewhere's your father.  he couldn't make it.  my parents are divorced.   your parents are divorced..  attention everyone: buster's parents are divorced.  assemble at once for a group hug.   d.w.: i thought he didn't go because of a cold.  that was an excuse.  buster: hi, guys.   uh... hi, buster.  are you stuck to the wall, arthur.  no.  why do you ask.  you could be.  these posters for the picnic still have glue on them.  ugh.  so, you're not going again, right.  yep, i've got other plans.  hey, my sister won't be home.  why don't you come with my family.  thanks, but like i said, i'm busy.  see you around.    whoa.  i wish we could help buster.  why don't you get him a new dad.  d.w., dads are not like babysitters.  you can't just get another when one is busy.  it's a good idea.  we could get someone to be buster's dad just for that day.  but who.  pal. stay away from that...   he always finds me.  he must know i'm allergic.  sorry.  so, where could we find a dad who's guaranteed to be a lot of fun at a party.    arthur: it's all set.  buster will say yes, they'll go to the picnic and he'll have fun.   i think it's working.  well. did he say yes.  are you going to take him.  nope.  he said he was busy, but he wanted the balloons.  oh, they cost five dollars.   well, maybe the balloons will cheer him up.  i guess not.  brain: buster wouldn't go with a clown because he'd stick out.  but if you had something that looked like a dad...   brain: say hello to lafthe first "lifelike automated father."  it's incredible.  i used a store mannequin and spare parts from a mechanical cat.  he's coming.       huh.  are you okay, sir.  oh, no.  i forgot to replace the voice mechanism.  oh, no. you must have swallowed a cat.    wait a minute.  brain: just trying out my new toy.  oops, guess it's broken.  arthur: yeah, we better go fix it.  see you.   he'd be perfect.  arthur: i wouldn't want him as a dad.  francine: it's too bad buster has no one to go to the picnic with.  if only some nice grownup with no kids of his own would take him.  poor buster.  i always had such a good time at that thing with my father.  man: if esther took four persimmons and gave ezekiel two how many would obadiah be left with.  none.  that is correct.  may we do another, father.  one math problem is never enough.  please, please, please.   buster i don't have anyone with whom to go to the father's day picnic.  would you care to join me.  the skin of a marshmallow turns brown through a process known as carbonization.  you should be taking notes, buster.  there will be a test on this tomorrow.  luckily, i have other plans.  i mean, i have other plans.  thanks anyway.  oh.   arthur, could i talk to you.  everyone is acting really weird around me and...  sorry, buster, really busy.   i wanted to say if you think i'm upset about father's day...  father's day's going to be great.  can't talk now. bye.  aw...  he's gone.  he looked really sad.  the picnic is the day after tomorrow.  we've got to do something.  i do a great dad voice: "go to your room, arthur." uh, i don't think buster wants a puppy for a father.  my sister rubella could hypnotize buster so he thinks this is his father.  buster can't walk around with a cushion.  everyone will laugh at him.  i've got the answer.  it's a virtualreality toy.  you slip it on and put a disc in it.  this one is called "daddy." mechanical voice: hello, son.  want to play catch.  this is so cool.  on second thought i think i'll use the helmet and buster can have my dad.  maybe i could be buster's dad.  i'm older.  only by one year.  well, i don't see a lot of other fathers lined up behind me.  here are the books on how to be a parent.  thanks, and tie your shoelaces.  "once upon a time there was a cow, a spoon, a fork and a knife."   binky: ah, isn't it nice to have some quality time together.  hot chocolate, my boy.  ow. watch it.  why don't you take those glasses off.  quit moving the cup.  i mean... watch it, my boy.  this is a hot beverage.  binky, why do you keep calling me your boy.  um... uh...  uh, "starve a cold and feed a fever." is this some crazy plan arthur cooked up to keep me from feeling like i don't have a dad.  uh, yes...  no.  just play along, doofus.  it's for your own good.  well, you can tell him i already have a father and i'm not sad.  yes, you are.  you're miserable.  whoa.  huhsome son.  i bet he doesn't even get me a tie for father's day.  well, i wonder who my father is today.  is it the cashier.  oh, is it that piata.  don't worryi've stopped trying to find someone to go to the picnic.  now you believe i have something else to do.  no, but i've decided not to go.  i won't have a good time if you're sad your father's not around.  arthur, you're a really good friend...  i know.  but you don't always listen.  i admit it: sometimes i do get upset that my parents aren't together.  once in a while i just really want to see my dad, but i can't.  i have to call him instead.  but i really enjoy the time i get to spend with him.  and even though my parents aren't together we're still a family.  it's just different than yours.  so stop worrying about me.  okay... so, will you come to the picnic.  no.  i have plans.  come on, be honest.  if you had plans, you'd tell me.  i'm your best friend.  you'll find out soon enough.   okay, arthur.  get ready, here it comes.  arthur: i got it.   oops.  ratburn: and up there is a baybreasted warbler gimme. gimme.  it's a dragon.  no, it's a u.f.o.  no, it's...  buster baxter..  happy father's day.  happy father's day.   boy: look, it's buster.  hooray, it's buster.   buster, this is incredible.  yep.  my dad rented balloon rides for the whole afternoon.  see, arthur.  i wanted it to be a surprise.  now, who wants a ride.  kids: me.  arthur, what's wrong.  aren't you coming.  of course i'm coming.  but i have to clean up.  i have egg on my face.  buster: well, hurry up.  kids: and now...  we're making ourselves out of clay.  boy: we're making clay figures of ourselves.  and then we're making pictures of a family in the background.  it's our family.  girl: i made a background with my mom, my brother and my sister.  my family is a mom and a dad and fish and me.  it doesn't matter what kind of family you have but you still have a family.  in my picture, i have my mom, my dad my aunt, my little cousin and my baby cousin.  well, i have my mom and my dad and my sister, tela and my two brothers, chazz and joey.  and my cousin jessica that i put in there because she lives with us.  boy: some families are lightskinned, some families are brownskinned.  some families even have dark skin and light skin mixed up.  some families just have a sister and a mom.  my mom, my sister and me.  my brother, my sister and my baby sister...  my mom, my dad, my stepmother, my stepsister and my other brother and my other brother, too.  that's it.  there's all different kinds of people and families.  they don't need to be the same because if all of them were the same that would be boring.  and now...   arthur : welcome to the house of fashion horrors.  step inside and see clothes that will curl your hair and hair that will curl your toes.  here lies a girl who did her own hair.  keep your eyes openthat is, if you dare.  behold the boy who dressed himself.  nice outfit.  now his only friends are a skunk and an elf.  there's bathingcap boyit's his mother's ruleand the absentminded genius who wore p.j.s to school.   now it's time to be scared.  this is the worst.  prunella finds out what it's like to be cursed.  it's not what she has, it's what's missing that's scary.  hold on to your hats, she's in the library.  : hey, where'd she go.  prunella.  hey, prunella.  tv announcer: and now back tosilver hills.  woman: oh, tiffee, i can't go to this dance.  i look terrible.  tiffee: come on, cali, you look fine.  just go and have fun.  i don't know.  what are you wearing.  oh, nothing.  just these.  those are flash pants.  look, rubella, there they are.  that's what you want for your birthday.  yes.  wouldn't i look great in them.  jake won't care what you're wearing.  oh, yes, he willdon't go.  : i have a prediction.  jake is going to dump her just like in the previews.  : wow.  that's tiring.  i need a snack.  hold on, mom.  it's okay, it's rubella.  it's a wonderful idea for a birthday gift.  they're so into what they're wearing.   yes, i think that's what she was hinting about.  yes, that's rightsilver.  she'll be so surprised.   i'm sure the postman will bring it this week.  d.w.: what will you bring me.  do you want me to guess.  ...  here's our number and you know the emergency numbers are on the fridge, right.  we're all set.  don't worry about a thing.  you go and have a good time.  d.w.: i knew you wouldn't know what to bring me so i made this.  you can choose anything you like.   rubella: with the full moon eclipsing in your sign your planetary forces will align.  you got me in here to read me that.  wait a minute.  i think i'm getting a prediction of my own.  vibrations...  rubella: here...  something for you...  in the future.  a gift of some kind.  something to do with the day you were born.  the sweepstakes.  i'll win the sweepstakes.  prunes, are you even listening.  i said the day you were bornyour birthday.  oh... right.  it appears to be from someone older.  from that sweepstakes guy.  i give up.  from mr. ratburn.  i didn't have time to have the invitations printed but i'm inviting everyone.  can you come.  i'll ask.  grandma thora, can i go skating at the rink tomorrow with everybody.  it's snowing. it's snowing.  can we play outside.  yes and yes.  more people should be like you.  look.  arthur's coat shrunk.  huh.  arthur's coat hasn't shrunk.  arthur's grown.  is he going to have to stay inside all winter.  no, we'll have to find a bigger coat until your parents get back.  i think i have just the thing at my house.  prunella: i've got it.  your predictionit must be grandma and grandpa.  they haven't sent my present.  what is it.  shh...  let's look at the cards.  i see something shiny.  the color is hard to make out.  wait.  maybe...  silver.   flash pants.  here it is.  your dad used to love this coat.  whwha....  it's a mr. puffy coat.  remember him.  mr. who.  maybe he's before your time.  he was one of the terrific three.  that's landfish and the legal eaglehalf lawyer, half bird.  but your dad's favorite was mr. puffy.  arthur looks like a big green marshmallow.  grandma: nothing could hurt mr. puffy.  he was super soft.  terrific.  let's go to the park.  arthur will make a perfect snowball target.  even i couldn't miss him.  maybe we better stay at home.  muffy: my parents were in paris and they saw flash pants months ago.  oh, that's nice.  i'm going to wear mine skating tomorrow.  prunella, do you really have flash pants.  of course.  my grandparents are sending them for a late birthday present.  i don't know how anybody could go skating tomorrow without flash pants.  : must... buy.  i mean i just remembered something i have to do.  i better go check the mail.  did the mail come.  uhhuh, and there's something for you.  prunella: it's not the flash pants, is it.  maybe they folded them up super small so you'd be surprised.  really. you think.  what is it.  it's a watch.  i don't believe it.   at least i knew it was silver.  hello.   yeah, she's here.  guess what i'm wearing, prunella.  flash pants.  we're going to look so great together tomorrow.  how do yours fit.  i... got to go.    puffy...  i'll race you across the pond.  man: ah, skate away, children.  enjoy your party.  only you forgot to invite one person: mr. melt.  that's me.  i'm mr. melt, and i wasn't invited.  let's see how you like your little skating party when it becomes a pool party.   wwhat.  the iceit's breaking up.  ha. everyone into the pool.  arthur: not so fast, meltface.  mr. puffy.  guess what.  you're going to the party after all.   hey, everybody, i float.  jump on.  who are you.  mr. moldy marshmallow man.  i'm mr. puffy.   but i saved you.  ii saved you.   i can't let anybody see me in that coat.  rubella: you'll look fine.  just go and have fun.  nobody's going to be looking at your pants.  i want to look at your pants.  what.  i have to see your outfit.  i'll send the chauffeur over to pick you up.  muffy, i can't.  i got to go.  okay, okay.  see you at the rink.  we'll be the only ones there in fashion.  oh...  now what are you doing.  i'm stocking up.  i'm not leaving my room this winter.  oh, come on.  you can't just sit in your room and eat peanut butter and soup all winter.  no, you're right.  i'll need some crackers.  crackers.  crackers, crackers.  whoa.  arthur.  oh, hey, prunella.  is this your hair.  man : cleanup in aisle three near the puffy green boy.   hey, isn't that a mr. puffy coat.  uh...  yeah.  i love that comic.  it's hilarious.  really.  and landfish is always eating bugs.  it was a great tv show, too.  so it was supposed to be funny.  could you hand me some crackers, please.  what are all the crackers for.  well... i was going to stay home this weekend but maybe...  maybe i can go skating.  guess i don't need these.  i'll take them.  i was afraid that people would think my coat was weird.  dumb, huh.  : yeah.  well, i better get over to the rink.  next.  arthur, wait up.  sorry, i don't want any of these.  i'm going skating.  prunella: i can't go skating.  don't you know how.  please.  no.  look at muffy.  she's wearing flash pants.  arthur: uh...  so.  i told everyone i would wear them.  you can't turn back now.  and look at what everyone else is wearing.  my mom made me wear this helmet.  but i don't know why...   come on, you guys.  why wait.  you're missing the fun.  yeah, what we are waiting for.  what the matter with muffy.  she's afraid of ruining her new pants.  hey, where are your flash pants.  i didn't wear them because i never...  i'm only wearing them because you were.  i'm tired of standing around.  i'm going to go change into some old clothes so i can skate.  see.  i told you you shouldn't worry about what you're wearing.  well, actually, i toldyoufirst.  hey.  cut it out.  .  hi, everyone, it's me, buster.  it seems like
