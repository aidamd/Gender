the street    everybody that you meet has an original point of view     and i say hey   hey.   what a wonderful kind of day    if we could learn to work and play    and get along with each other    you've got to listen to your heart, listen to the beat    listen to the rhythm, the rhythm of the street    open up your eyes, open up your ears    get together and make things better    by working together    it's a simple message, and it comes from the heart    believe in yourself, for that's the place to start    and i say hey   hey.   what a wonderful kind of day    if we could learn to work and play    and get along with each other   hey.   what a wonderful kind of day   hey.   what a wonderful kind of day   hey.  hey, dw.  hey.  whoa...  and now, stepping up to the plate with the bases loaded is rookie george lundgren.  lundgren is making his big league debut facing the most damaging arm in pitching history: walter "big train" johnson.  the train has left the station.  deep, deep, deep into left field.  back. way back.  we're talkin' feet.  we're talkin' time zones.  and a massive grand slam in his first career at bat.  around the bases and around the world with george "lucky lundy" lundgren.   so, lucky lundy, how are you feeling about your first day of little league practice.  well, wally, last year, i missed the age cutoff by two weeks, so i've been waiting for this day a long time.  i'm bringing my "a" game, but i'll be taking my cues from the coach and the rest of the team.  modest words from a sports legend.  now, back to the drawer for the sock report.  george: and do you know which world series was lost because of a single strike.  1994.  there was no world series because the players were on strike.  : trick question.  arthur: wow, george.  i didn't know you knew so much about baseball.  it's always been a hobby of mine.  francine, can you hit a few out to george and arthur.  actually, i'm having a little trouble with my swing.  looks like your stance is a little stiff.  have you tried shifting your weight.  what do you mean.  shift from your back foot to your front while you swing.  good advice.  where'd you pick that up.  a website about alltime power hitters.  ruth, mantle, williams...  they compare old style weight shift versus new style...   that's frensky style.  hey, george, any advice for a nonpower hitter like me.  how can i hit the strike zone every time.  i'm interested in your thoughts on the physics of the knuckleball.  we've got a few weeks before our first game.  let's give george some time to get his own practice in.  george, welcome to the team.  wally: practice, day two.  the grebelings' spring training shows a promising season ahead.  on the other hand, it's a good thing for lundgren there are three more weeks of practice.  with opening day a week away, it looks like lundgren might have discovered his position.  oof.  wally: horizontal.  but sometimes it takes until the last day of spring training for a player to find his strengths...   ...and sometimes even longer to find his bat.  so after a disastrous preseason performance, what are you thinking about heading into tomorrow's opening game.  i'm thinking i've been holding this ball for five minutes and i only dropped it once.  see.  you are getting better.  no, i'm not.  if anything, i think i've gotten worse.  most of us weren't any good, even after a lot of practices.  most of us still aren't any good.  we're just a little less notgood.   i hope you're right.  can i borrow this book about the craziest plays in baseball history.  sure.  take anything you want.  i don't want to look at them anymore.  mr. lundgren: i made it just for you.  it's called the lundgren slugger.  wow, it's beautiful.  stepping up to the plate, george lundgren, the sultan of swat.  here's the windup, the pitch...  hey, rookie.  ready for your first atbat.  uh... no.  just remember to shift your weight.  works for me every time.  come on, george, you can do it.  george. george. george.  george. george.  stepping up to the plate, george lundgren, the sultan of sweat.   you're out.  sorry.       yay...  you're out.    yes.  oliver:i want to congratulate you all on an amazing season so far.  and if we win tomorrow's game, we're in the playoffs.  now, before we get to the ice cream, my friend harry mills from theelwood city times has something to ask you.  if it's okay with you, i'd like to come to the game tomorrow and do a story about the grebelings.  whoa.  in the paper.   isn't that amazing.  they're doing a story just on us.  yep.  harry, you have to meet george.  he knows more about baseball than anyone.  then maybe he'd like to join us for the grebes game tonight.  i happen to have three extra tickets.  all right. go grebes.  um, thanks mr. mills, but i...  i'm busy.  maybe another time.  you know, for a kid who's a big fan, he doesn't seem that enthusiastic.   wally: big train looks like he's working up a lot of steam.  it's too heavy.    wally: strike.   hey, george, what are you doing here.  i came to give this to francine.  aren't you coming to the game today.  i've decided to quit the team.  why.  because i'm no good.  and i really used to like baseball.  now it just makes me feel rotten.  i know it's frustrating.  but think it over.  maybe come to the game today and just sit it out.  no pressure.  okay.  but i still think francine should use the lundgren slugger.  i'm afraid she won't be using it today.    you're sick.  i'll get you some soup, sweetie.  can you call me and tell me what's happening.  but i don't have a cell phone.  you can use mine.  and you might as well bring the lundgren slugger along, in case we need an extra bat.   you're out.  this seat taken.  i'm not going to talk baseball.  oh, it's okay.  i just...  you don't have to explain.  i had a miserable first year of little league, too.  anyway, i'll let you make your call.  it's francine.  she's home sick and...  yeah, tough break for the team.   hi, francine.  we just finished the first inning.  it started off with binky throwing some wild pitches.  but then the mountaineers got swinghappy and binky struck out three in a row.  bottom first, arthur singled through the hole.  muffy hit into a double play, and buster struck out.  i'll call you back when the...   whoa.  one of the mountaineers just hit a missile way out to center.  carl is waving arthur off.  looks like he's under it.  oh no.  lost it in the sun.  mountaineer rounding first.  arthur scoops it up on one bounce.  he sets, throws to second.  it's high...  reaches.  grabs it.  makes the tag.  mountaineer out at second.  yes.  i'm here with harry mills.  harry, you think the grebelings might be feeling a little momentum.  well, george, they're relieved, but it's a little early to get too confident.  harry, i have to agree.  with the leading run on third and the mountaineers pitching, the windup, the pitch...  a sinker, but read gets under it and bam.  it's a hard drive past first.  brain is heading home.  right fielder scoops it, fires to first.  read is...  out on a sac single.  whoo.  and the grebelings take the lead in the bottom of the sixth.   oh, no.  the phone battery's going.  francine, i'll call you right back.  quick, who's got a phone.  and with two outs in the bottom of the ninth, barnes on first, it comes down to buster baxter.  it's do or die.  the windup...  the pitch...   he hit it.  hard to left field.  run, buster, run.  baxter's first hit of the season, a bomb over the head of the left fielder.  binky is hustling to second as baxter reaches first.  centerfield grass seems to have eaten the ball.  buster: binky.  george: and we seem to have a bit of a traffic jam.  move, move.  center fielder has recovered the ball.  he launches it in.  binky passing third, the park is erupting.  the pitcher cuts it off, throws home, bounces in front of the catcher.  he can't get his handson the ball.  catcher has control, set to tag...  binky : get out of my way.  george: the catcher has rolled himself into a ball.  harry, in all your years...  never seen anything like that.  and the grebelings literally stampede their way to the playoffs.  they have pulled it out with their ace hitter frensky on the dl.  francine, we did it.  the grebelings win.  all: the grebelings win.  looks like your friend might have a career in baseball after all.  george : we have perfect weather for the first game of the playoffs.  george lundgren here with the grebelings' star powerhouse francine frensky, fresh off the dl.  francine, how does it feel to be back.  great, george.  i'm feeling better and looking forward to playing some ball.  in fact, i think i'll head out there right now.  you don't know how much i've missed it.  me too.   and that one is outta there.  and now...  kids: whoa.  today we're showing all of our talents and interests.  here are some of my cookies.  i can speak arabic.  here are some words that i know.  himarhaba.  yesna'am.  this is my picture of a pizza man.  this is my picture of a robot.  my second grade is good at a lot of things.  this is part of our school song.   there's a school upon a hill    that is a very special place...   there's a lot of different things that can be an interest or a talent.   i like to draw.  nate drew a lot of cool stuff on this.  it's pretty cool how you can do a braid in your hair.  well, i did this one.  my mom started it off.  i love local history.  john greenleaf whittier is a poet, and he's from this town of haverhill.  i love my pet dog.  his name is freddy.  this is freddy in glasses.  he loves to jump and play with me.  my name is elena, and i play soccer.  i have eight girls on my team.  they are really good soccer players.  this is my hockey stick.  i like hockey because my pa teaches me.  i like building because you can build stuff that's in your imagination.  i like baking because you can crack eggs.  today, i baked brownies.  this is my fishing rod.  this is my fishing toolbox.  this is my net.  we like to play basketball.  hey, joey, get your fishing net.  okay.   i like softball, and i'm number four.  this is my glove.   the second grade is so amazing.  and now...  contrary to popular belief, i don't take getting "a's" for granted.  my mom puts them on the refrigerator, just like other kids.  and just like other kids, all the refrigerators are kept in my secret warehouse, where they are hermetically sealed and stored in chronological order.  so as you can see, just because i never make a mistake doesn't mean...   hey.  nothing to see behind that sheet.  no.  please don't look.  it's my only failure.  mr. ratburn: i'll repeat the question: obadiah makes 24 pairs of shoes.  he makes three kinds of shoesclogs, sandals and pumpsin equal quantity.  how many pairs of clogs will he make.  can obadiah make sneakers.  that is irrelevant.  now concentrate.   well.  octopus.  i mean...  52.   brain.  eight.  that is correct.  buster, you may want to review division before the upcoming arithmattack competition.  or as i like to call it, the "brain wins again" competition.  this year, we'll be doing something a little different.  instead of competing individually, you will be in randomly assigned teams.  and the first team is brain, binky and buster.   so are you nervous.  it's going to be tough being on brain's team.  he could lose this year.  brain doesn't care about a silly math award.  prunella: you may have beaten me twice before, but this year you're facing the wizardly order of the 4th grade.  prepare to be divided and conquered.  brain: over my dead calculator.  brain's binomials are going to turn your team into a null set.  hi, guys.  buster, why are you buttering your hand.  huh.  oh.    that prunella thinks she's got this contest in the bag.  well, we'll just see about that.  we will.  i don't know if you've noticed this, brain, but i'm terrible at math.  don't worry.  i'll tutor you after school.  okay.  thanks, brain.  i think what gives me the most trouble is...  there are lots of study techniques i've been dying to try out.  like the number cruncher.  it's a new fusion of situps and arithmetic.   brain: okay, buster, first off, drink this algae and fish oil smoothie.  it's brain food.  since this is our first study session together, i thought we'd go easy: just five hours.   five hours.  don't worry, we'll study in short bursts and you'll get a bathroom break at hour four.  you might want to slow down with that smoothie.  now, which do you have the most trouble with: word problems, graphs or sequencing.  yes.  i see we'll need to start at the beginning.  good.  because what really gives me the most trouble is...   the history of math from asquared to infinity.  it's pretty riveting.  did you know the babylonians may have used the pythagorean theorem thousands of years before the greeks.  you want me to study for a math contest by reading a history book.   of course not.  i also want you to do 20 other exercises.  let's get cracking.    nice study session, buster.  but tomorrow i'm not going to take it so easy on you.   pi is 3.14159...  there's a mathematician somewhere in that boy.  and i'm going to find it.  the lifetime achievement award for mathematics goes to...  brain.   thank you, professor.  but all my awards mean nothing compared to my greatest accomplishment: my pupil, buster baxter.  behold as he takes on robocount, the world's most sophisticated supercomputer.  calculate the circumference of the universe.   done.  he's correct.      oh, brain, you're a pedagogical genius.  prunella: the answer is...  five and a third.   that is correct.  the wizardly order of the 4th grade wins and makes it through to the finals on monday.  booyah.  let's bring out our next two teams: brain's binomials and steve's square roots.  uh, 31.  i'm sorry, but that is incorrect.   the next question goes to...  buster. huh.   just remember what we worked on.  joey gets his allowance every day.  on monday, he gets two cents.  on tuesday...  : blah, blah, blah...    ahh.  buster.  are you all right.  yes, fine.  the answer is...  3.14159265.  i'm sorry, that is incorrect.    brain's binomials are not disqualified yet.  they still have a chance if binky gets the next one right.  binky, are you ready.  huh.  me already.  hold this.  what is the square root of 49.  seven.  that is correct.   brain's binomials win the round and will face the wizardly order in ton monday.  you did it.  that was amazing.  oh, here...  keep it.   you're going to lose so bad, you won't know your prime numbers from your integers.  oh, yeah.  i hope you're good at adding negative numbers, because that's what your score's going to be.  have you seen buster.  um, i think he had a dentist appointment.  can i have some salt, please.  buster, what are you doing under the table.  oh.  i, uh, misplaced my lunch.  here it is.  sneaky lasagna.  you don't have to hide from me.  i'm not upset you got the question wrong.  you're not.  no.  it's my fault. i haven't been pushing you hard enough.  if you push me any harder, my head will explode.  here, we're going to try some mistakeaversion therapy.  every you get a question wrong, i dump a glass of water on your head.  you're missing the point.  what really gives me trouble is...  what's 52 divided by four.  i don't know.  twelve.   you may be the twotime arithmattack champion, but you're a terrible tutor.  thank you, professor.  but all my awards mean nothing compared to my greatest accomplishment: my pupil, buster baxter.   all right, buster, i'd like you to calculate...  calculate.  buster no calculate.  buster no like numbers.  numbers bad.        binky.  we're going for a walk.   mom, tell arthur he can have my dark bunny remote control buggy.  do you know why i brought you here.  do i want to know.  last year, i had a lot of trouble with math, to sometimes i'd be in such a daze, i'd bang my head on this jungle gym.  huh.  i always wondered how that got there.  brain's tutoring hasn't worked out for you so far, has it.  he's tried his best, but he just doesn't understand that what really gives me trouble is...  your multiplication tables.  how did you know.  because i've been there.  want to know how i finally figured them out.  one day, i was at home watching tv...  it was ballet.  an italian troupe called "i piedi grandi." they weren't very good.  but there was nothing else on, so i continued watching and i started counting them, and that's when it hit me.  there were two rows of them, and four dancers in each row.  so two times four was eight.  so now, instead of thinking of numbers when mr. ratburn gives me a problem, i imagine little dancers.  but i'm not into dance.  the only dance i know is the hokeypokey.  you've got to find out what works for you, buster.  i like cake.  okay, it's a little strange, but we can work with it.  let's say you have three cakes and they all have three layers.  i want you to imagine them.  i can see them right in front of me.  look at all those layers.  the score is tied.  this year's arithmattack award will be decided by this final question.  and the question goes to...  buster baxter.  don't worry.  i tutored him real good.  okay, buster.  this one is a multiplication question.  what is 12 times three.  ah.  is it... 36.  that is correct.   brain: how could binky have been a better tutor than me.  math is one of my best subjects.  i needed someone who struggled, like me.  but if you want, i can teach you how to be a better tutor.  really.  sure.  there's some new techniques i've been dying to try out, like the tutorrooter.  first, we scrub your ears with vinegar.  then you clean my room...  whicharthurcharacter are you.  i am a francine...   ...because i really like sports.  would you just shoot already.   i like soccer.  woohoo. give it up
