 i'm trying to answer the question.  what is the question.  audience: freddy, freddy.  how did you feel when you discovered ethel had taken your husband stolen all your money and burned your house down.   boy. sometimes it seems like the whole world is filled with nothing but fighting.  arthur, could i.  not now, d.w.i'm busy.  i mean, why is it so hard for people to get along.  everyone wants the same things: a home, enough food, friends...  i just wanted to ask...  i said, not now.  if only people acted like they were part of one big family...  d.w.: arthur.  quit bothering me. i said i was busy.  why don't you play with pal or something.  where was i.  oh, yeah.  if people acted like they were in one big family then there'd be peace in the world.    dad: honey, you've got to come quick.  i finally did it.  it's by far, the most amazing, beautiful, colossal...  delicate, delectable, delightful....  dear, what is it.  behold the david l. read super souffl.   she did it. he did it.  arthur: she did it.  d.w.: i'm telling you, he did it.  everyone into the living room, now.  all right, what happened.  d.w. wanted to play, and i didn't... i wanted to ask arthur a question...  she hit pal with his toy... but pal started jumping up and down...  with that slimy toy...  arthur:..  i've heard enough.  no tv for both of you for two months.  why am i being punished.  it was her fault.  was not.  was, too.  that's itthree months.  three months.. three months..  david, maybe that is a bit...  four months.  oh, forget it.  look how upset you've made daddy.  okay, you two, i think you both need to cool down a little.  up to your rooms.  can i still go to the petting zoo with the tibbles later.  and i have to go the bionic bunny arcade.  it just opened.  we'll just have to wait and see.  it's not fair.  she does something wrong and i get punished, too.  i'll probably always be taking the blame for her.  d.w., where did you get all this "crazy bus" stuff.   man: open up. it's the police.   arthur.  what are policemen doing inyour room.  my room.. but this is....  looks like we caught the crazy bus crook redhanded.  book him, charlie.  d.w.: hello, arthur.  i asked mom and dad to come, too, but they wouldn't.  they were too ashamed.  you're the one who should be in here.  i'm innocent, and you know it.  oh, blahblahblahblah.  you'll be out in 50 years.  here, i thought you might want a little music.   no.   i'd better do something about this before it's too late.  d.w. why me.  with all the good brothers in the world why did i get stuck with arthur..   we wanted to make sure you were still coming to the petting zoo.  probably not.  i'm being punished for something arthur did.  that's the worst.  i'm always getting blamed for something timmy did.  tommy: i get blamed more.  no, i do.  liar.  you're the liar.  look at those two.  they can't go two minutes without fighting.   that's what arthur and i will be like, forever.  admit it.  you broke the souffl.  no, you did it.  i don't want to spend all my time fighting.  it's so boring.  i've given it a lot of thought and i think we should do the right thing.  me, too.  well. aren't you going to confess.  me. but it's your fault.  is not.  is, too.  is, not.  is, too.   we've got to get to the bottom of this.  your father and i have come to a decision.  arthur, you can go to the arcade and d.w., you can go to the petting zoo....  if,and only if, we can resolve this problem.  we want to hear what happened from both of you.  if you want, you can draw pictures to help explain it.  and we are not going to interrupt each other.  who wants to go first.  me. me.  let's armwrestle to decide.  no way. your arm's bigger.  d.w., how doyouthink we should decide who goes first.  we should flip a coin.  heads.  tails.  dad: heads.  i was going to say, "heads".  can we flip another coin to see who gets to say "heads" first.  no, dear.  arthur, you go first.  i'll tell you exactly what happened.  i was in the den, sitting on the couch...  liar. you were in the chair.  mom: d.w.  your turn is coming.  anyway, i was just minding my own business doing my homework...  when d.w. came barging in, wanting to play.  play with me. now.  i can't, d.w.  i have to finish my homework.  so she started bothering pal.  she was throwing his bacon toy all wrong so i had to show her the right way to do it.  like this....  then i threw it to her but she missed it because she wasn't paying attention.  i got it, i got it.  arthur: d.w., wait.  i tried to tell her to watch out for dad's souffl but i didn't get there in time.   arthur did it.  and that's just the way it happened.  so you see, it was all her fault.  the end.  boy, i'm surprised we're not all asleep.  that's usually what happens when people listen to fairy tales.  okay, d.w., now you can tell us what happened.  but what if you believe arthur's story because he draws better.  you don't have to draw it.  the arcade will be closed by the time she's ready.  sorry it took so long.  i had trouble finding the right doll for arthur.  all right, everyone.  get ready for the real story.  first of all, i didn't want to play with arthur.  he always thinks i'm dying to play with him like he's the most fun brother in the world.  um, honey, maybe we could just skip to the...  mom: uhuhuh, david.  no interrupting.  anyway i did want to ask arthur a question.  dearest brother, what is the time.  quit bothering me.  i'm pretending to do my homework.    d.w.: then pal picked up the bacon toy because he wanted to play with me.  arthur: that doesn't look a thing like pal.  and it's a female.  mom: arthur.  arthur: okay, okay.  d.w.: everything was going fine until arthur butted in and threw the toy really hard.  i ran into the kitchen to get it because i knew we shouldn't play near daddy's sloofay...  but then arthur pushed me into the table and that's what made the sloofay fall.  that's what really happened.  liar.  you're the liar.   d.w., did you actually see the souffl fall.  no.  but you were both in the kitchen when it happened.  mom: i see that neither of you are wearing shoes.  the kitchen floor is pretty slippery in just socks.  i was running kind of fast.  so was i.  it all happened so fast...  d.w.: i guess i could have slipped into the table...  arthur: it's possible i slid into d.w.   maybe we both kind of made the souffl fall.  now, isn't there something we can do for dad.  pal already cleaned up the mess...  arthur and d.w.: we're really, really sorry.  i've got just enough time to get to the arcade.  i hope the tibbles are still home.    i don't think i've ever seen dad looking so down before.  me, neither.  what can we do.  arthur: did you separate the egg yolks from the egg whites.  yup. here are the whites.  i put the other part in the sink.  those aren't the whites.  those are the shells.  and what color are they, mr. knowitall.  who put you in charge of making the sloofay anyway.  it's sooflay. sooflay.  you can't even say it right.   what is it now.  well, we saw how upset you were so we decided not to go out and make you another shooflay but then arthur...  you were trying to make a souffl.  well, let's get to it.  now, the key is fresh gruyere.  oh, and we'll need some nutmegthat's my little secret...  mom: david, that is the most beautiful thing you've ever made.  dad:..  it's the most beautiful thing we'veever made.  kids:..  the pen.  here is the pen.  yup, this is the pen.  the special pen.  this is the special pen that steve and marcus have.  i am steve.  i think pen is mine.  i'm marcus.  i think the pen is mine.  we're going to help these guys.  girl: karma is our teacher.  she split us into groups so we could solve the problem.  she told us what happened.  marcus was using this special pen.  steve said that the pen that marcus was using was his.  but now there's only one pen and two kids who say it's their pen.  and they got into an argument.  you are going to work on this problem.  she taught us to act out what we think happened.  one person's going to be steve and one person's going to be marcus.  role playing is acting it out.  okay, that's my pen.  no, it isn't.  i bought it with my dad.  but this is my pen.  well, i have the same one.    can i have my pen.  i had a pen like this.  okay, fine. what should we do.  please write down a solution to the problem.  "we would give the pen to one person "one week, and the pen to the other the next week." "marcus gets it in the winter and fall "and steve gets it in the summer and spring." some of these solutions were fair and some weren't.  "we should have a raffle." "steve or marcus buys a new pen." we can't solve this today.  it's good to talk about these problems.  kids:and now...  arthur: being a kid is about the most fun job i can think of.  whoa, i feel dizzy.  me, too.  isn't it great.  yeah.  ew. gross.  let's do it again.  okay.   that wasn't even close, arthur.  i know, but it was fun.  hmm. it does have a certain appeal.    i really can't imagine why anyone would ever be in a hurry to grow up.   francine: hi, muffy.  francine, why do you insist on embarrassing me like that.  excuse me.  that lunch box you're carryingit's so...  babyish.  i mean, your mom packs you peanut butter and jelly.  please,francine.  "mature misses" head for the salad bar.  they do.  of course they do.  it says so right here.   oh, honestly, francine.  pjs with feet are so secondgrade.  but... i like these.  maybe so.  but "mature misses" only wear pajamas without feet, see.  if you're somature then maybe you shouldn't sleep over.  maybe you ought to find someone else to hang out with altogether.  oh, really.  yes, really.  someone more... grownup, perhaps.  what a wonderful idea, francine.  i think that's exactly what i'll do.  i'll find a friend who appreciates my maturity.  fine.  i'm calling daddy right now and telling him to send the limo to pick me up.  catherine: totally can't wait.  angi's party will be, like, the best ever.  uh, look, i got to go.  i'll call you back.  oh, catherine i overheard your conversation.  i just want you to know i think it's so cool that you get to go to parties and do other mature stuff like that.  yeah, whatever.  are you kidding.  it's completely amazing.  i can't wait to be a teenager.  really, muffy, it's not like it's all fun.  sometimes it's a total challenge.  like, take tomorrow for instance: i only have 24 hours to pick out an outfit for the party.  talk about pressure.  why don't you go "vintage".  everyone inmature missis.  you're virtually guaranteed to be unique.  vintage.  yeah. it's totally in.  i'd be happy to help you pick out an outfit.  i know this great little boutique on...  i don't think that's such a great idea.  why not.  because what if someone sees us.  you're in third grade, muffy.  no offense, but i do have a reputation to uphold.  you don't understandi'm very mature for my age.  i'm sure you are.  i know.  we can go early and beat the crowds.  no one will even see us.  i don't think so.  i'm not a morning person.  oh, come on, catherine, please.  it'll be fun.  we can take my dad's limo...  limo.  : okay, fine.  be here at 10:00 a.m. sharp.  great.  but understand it's just the outfit, muffy.  that's all the hanging out we do.  deal.  this is going to be so great.  i finally get to hang out with someone who's mature someone who's actually my speed.  catherine:..  muffy: no, no.  too nautical.  catherine, no.  never wear white after labor day.  i just don't think this is working.  i mean, we've been at it two hours and...  nothing.  i've got it.  that.  trust me.  it's so out, it's in.  oh, it's perfect just perfect.  i couldn't agree more.  what do you know.  i actually like it.  thanks for helping.  i'll have the coolest outfit at the party.  anyway, i'll see you around.  wait. i can't let you go to a party without getting your toenails done.  actually, i'm not really into the whole pedicure thing.  but check out that grasshopper green.  i read inmature miss that it'll make any feet look two sizes smaller.  really.  because my feet are a size 11.  when we're done, you'll be a nine.  i promise.  catherine: i've got to say, muffy my feet have never looked smaller.  well, thanks for noticing.  what do you say we go get some lunch.  my treat.  that's so mature of you.  i told you, catherine, i'm very mature for my age.  catherine: i'll have the house salad and an iced tea, please.  make that two.  excellent choice, ladies.  i'll be right back.  i need to use the restroom.  at last, someone who understands the joy of ageappropriate food.  this is too good to be true.  francine: muffy.  francine.  what areyou doing here.  we're going roller skating.  what are you doing.  i'm having a salad.  not that that's any of your business.  alone.  as a matter of fact, no.  i'm not alone.  i'm here with someone very mature.  oh, really. who.  catherine, if you must know.  catherine.  as in my sister catherine.  that's the one.  but you two couldn't possibly have anything in common.  catherine's in high school.  you're in third grade.  so.  you're in way over your head.  you're kidding yourself if you think she'll keep hanging out with someone your age.  we'll just see.  i guess we will.  come on, arthur.  huh. so jealousjust like a child.  i wonder where our salads are.  i need to get going.  actually, catherine i was just about to give you this.  it's a ring i bought at the thrift store.  the plastic stone will go perfectly with your new outfit.  thanks, muffy.  that's so cool of you.  cool enough to go to the party with you.  uh, no, not that cool.  come on, catherine, please.  we can take the limo again.  muffy, i'm sorry, but you can't come to the party.  i'll give you a ride.  you'll impress your friends and i'll be with you one last time.  fine.  but that's it.  thanks for the ride, muffy.  wow. way cool limo.  thanks. it's my dad's.  i'm muffy, a friend of catherine's.  she's a friend of my sister's.  and she was just leaving.  hi, muffy, i'm angi.  and this is debi and tami.  very cool outfit, catherine.  thanks, i picked it out myself.  though i have to give some credit to the inspirational folks atmature miss.  i have my very own prescription to their magazine.  you see, i'm very mature for my age.  why don't you come on in and join the party, muffy.  we were just about to hear about debi's first date with robert.  it'll be fun.  sounds great.  debi:.. at the end of the date he totally planted one on me.  it came out of nowhere.  i so couldn't believe it.  awesome. you're so lucky.  he planted onewhaton you.  catherine: duh.  she's talking about a kiss, muffy.  a kiss good night.  ew. that's disgusting.  i'd never let a boy kiss me.  not in a million years.  you mean... you've never been kissed by a boy before, muffy.  uh... of course i have.  i just meant... never on the first date.  that's what they teach inmature miss.  of course that's what you meant.     ew, gross.  oh. i love this song.  hey, i've got an idea.  why don't we all dance.  i learned some great moves inmature miss.   uh,hello.  dancing is for little kids, muffy.  teenagers just sit and listen to the poetry of the words.  oh... i mean, right.  let's not dance.  let's just sit and listen.  that's what i usually do.  uhhuh, sure it is.   so, who wants a cup of instant almondvanilla decaf.  teens: i do.  muffy.  mature misssays that coffee stunts your growth.  don't believe everything you read in those silly teen magazines.  anyway, come on, ladies.  coffee's this way.  isn't she funny.  she's so "mature." tami: you couldn't buy entertainment this good.  are you okay, muffy.   oh, come on, it's not that bad.  yes, it is.  your friends think i'm a big joke and i bet you do, too.  no, i don't.  i still think you're cool for a thirdgrader.  well, if i'm so cool, then how come tonight is such a disaster.  it isn't a disaster, muffy.  even though you may be mature for your age you're not ready to hang out with highschoolers.  that's all.  yeah, maybe you're right.  i mean, coffee.  kissing.  the "poetry of the words".  who am i kidding.  i'm not sure.  but i know someone who wants to hang out with you.  someone who's been moping all week, missing you.  francine.  i'm sure she's so mad at me.  do you think she'll forgive me.  i don't know, but it's worth a try.  you're pretty persuasive when you want to be.  thanks, catherine.  i'm going to call for a ride home.  enjoy your coffee.  hi, francine.  the salad bar's that way.  actually, i brought mine today.  peanut butter and jelly.  yep. my mom packed it.  what's this.  an invitation to my sleepover tomorrow night.  i don't know, muffy.  i don't think i have the "right" pajamas.  oh, you can wear whatever you want at this party, francine.  what's going on with you.  well, i'm not as mature as i thought i was.  you were right about the whole catherine thing.  it didn't work out.  anyway, i'm really sorry if i hurt you, francine.  well, it's okay.  i know you want to be a teenager.  i even think about it sometimes.  you do.  sure.  so would you consider getting rid of those awful footie pajamas.  don't push it, muffy.  just kidding.  buster: have you ever wondered how anarthurshow is made.  it took more than 100 people almost a year to make the show you're watching.  it all starts off with a great script that gets turned into a storyboard.  doesn't it look like a blackandwhite comic book.  all the actors get together to record in a studio.  i've got to quit, too.  buster: a whole team of artists paints all the scenes.  the director times every movement so that i can be animated.  let's hear it for teamwork.  visit us online at pbskidsgo.org.  you can findarthurbooks and lots of other books, too, at your local library.  n]  what a wonderful
