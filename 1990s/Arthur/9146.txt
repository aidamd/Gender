   maybe they aren't best friends...  aah.  but they've learned to work it out.   nothing was like when we all met sue ellen.      yahoo.  arthur: yeeha.  you guys will never catch me.  both: yeah.    i won, i won.  did not.  buster, who won.  guys, lookmoving van.  who's moving in.  arthur: come on...  let's go see.  francine: do you think they have kids.  buster: there's at least one kid.  well, i have hockey practice.  see you later.  i wonder if they're in there.  both: hmm...  : buster, your ears.   what is that weird stuff.  i don't seeany people.  kind of unearthly.  look out your window at this perfect weather...  both: aah.  because tomorrow will be cloudy and colder.  : i know why we didn't see people in there: they're invisible.    the new family in town sounds interesting.  i want to interview them.  have you seen them yet.  i don't think anybody's going to be able to see them, mom.  buster: we should go to the fbi before we go back to that house.  before you spread a crazy rumor, i want to be sure.  crazy.  oh, like the idea of invisible people is crazy... right.  arthur, how will we know if invisible people are chasing us.    buster: what do you see. huh.  i don't see any invisiblepeople.   aren't you glad we looked now.  yes.  this is worse than i ever imagined.  buster: sometimes they're invisible and sometimes they're not.  maybe it's just that their lights are on a timer.  that's just the kind of thinking that'll get this planet conquered.  hmph.  i heard strange things about them, too.  i knew it. what'd you hear.  rubella heard theyhadto leave their old home.  why.  maybe their planet's water got too polluted so they came to steal ours and...  they have a lot of statues and paintings and stuff in their home.  you know what i think.  prunella: i think they were in another city, like paris... france.               sue ellen: we must leave this countryset course for a place called...  "...elwood city, where no one suspects i'm here to rob them." whoa.  i saw hershe's not the cat burglar type.  thank you, miss jones.   : i'm not miss jones.  give me the master program or i ruin your computer forever.   i spy for a country that even i can't pronounce the name of but soon everyone will be struggling to say it as we conquer the world.  aah.   everyone's after you.  where will you go.  somewhere i can pretend to be an ordinary girl.  but one day i'll return to ninga...  ningafufuff...  ningafufuff...  i'll come back here.  arthur, that's the most ridiculous thing i ever heard.  i'm telling you...  she's part of an alieninvasion force given human form.  : hey... bravo.  all right.     who knows how many of them walk among us.  francine: muffy, guess what i heard about the new girl.  she's a criminal who came here to escape prison.  brain: she's weird and creepy.  no one knows exactly where she came from.  prunella: when you're hiding out, you always go to a small town...   binky: hello, hello.  what is everyone talking about.  hey, did you hear about the new kid.  who is this.  whoops, wrong number.  hi. i'm sue ellen. i just moved in.  where's the post office.   both: that way.  snow is so weird.  it's like cold, wet sand.  didn't they have snow on your planet... uh...  where you're from.  ve never seen it before.    is that music.  buster: yeah... outerspace music.   panting) wash and put on a clean shirt.  that new family is coming for dinner.  what..  i interviewed them yesterday for the paper.  ooh, they know i know, and they're coming to neutralize me.  their daughter's a stranger in town, so be nice to her.  stranger than you know, mom.  i'm not hungry.  aah.   roast beef...  mashed potatoes...  raspberry pie.  nothis may be a clever alien trap.  : you are the only human who knows our true identities.    ah, man, now earth is enslaved because i couldn't control my appetite.  i wish i'd brought some cookies.  buster: they're in my house.  did you see the article about sue ellen's family.  they lived all over the world.  that's why all their stuff is different and...  you don't believe that, do you.  your mom wrote it.  my own mom, fooled by aliens.  hey, what smells so good.  that's the bait they're using.  hey, if you came to eat with me, we could guard each other.  you should bring things from the places you've lived to class.  you really think so.  sue ellen: my father's worked all around the world.  the last place he worked was san jose the capital of costa rica.  how do you explain that you didn't know what snow was.  costa rica has a warm climateno snow.  hmm...  before, we lived in nigeria and these are kobothe coins they use there.  i'll pass them around.  thank you, sue ellen, and welcome.  kobo, shmobo. how do we know this is an earth metal.  my family wants you and your mom to come over for hot dogs.  arthur told me you love them and i've never had an american hot dog.  hot dogs.  hot dogs.  okay.  they've got methey know i can't resist them.  oh, well... maybe they're friendly aliens.  kids: and now...  all these kids in back of me are new in school.  we're new in school.  we're all new.  and i'm new in school, too.  we want to talk to somebody about this.  "dear sue ellen, i was nervous.  your friend, frankie." we're writing letters to sue ellen to tell her how we felt when we were new in school.  i thought i would never fit in.  "dear sue ellen "i know how it feels to be the new kid but after a week or so i started fitting in." some people are shy and stuff.  "dear sue ellen, i was really shy when i came to school.  your friend, dee david cole." i felt shy, but when i got over it, i was happy.  so if there was a new kid in my class, i would help him out.  girl 2: tell them everybody's names and be their new friend.  "dear sue ellen..." "dear sue ellen..." "i felt a little scared because i did not know anyone at my new school." "i felt nervous and shy." "but a few days later i met jason, and he is my best friend." "but the first friend i met was brian dennehy.  he is my best friend." "your friend, brian dennehy." "your friend, jason azul." kids: and now...  i love having my friends come over.  when buster's here, i never have to eat leftovers the next day.  arthur, don't forget to eat some peas.  buster: do you mind.  .. mmm.  there's none left.  i wish buster ate here every night.  and when francine visits, well...  let's just say next to her i look neat.  don't tell me...  francine was here.  i wish my friends could live here.  then everything would be perfect.  whoa.    is that a horse or a pig.  d.w., go away.  arthur...  guess what.  alan's spending the weekend.  his parents are going away.  alan.  alan who.  oh, you mean the brain.  great.  it will be like having a brothersomebody who'll do things i like.  i always wanted a brother.  hey.  instead, i got stuck with two sisters.  you're not stuck.  you can leave at any time, and i'll take your room.  we'll have all weekend to do great things like build a time machine.  are you sure this will work.  it will, after i insert the nuclear core.  open the door.  okay, let's go.  let's go back in time.   when do we go home.  home. i don't know how to go forward in timejust backwards.  do you mean we can never go home.      or maybe we'll build something simpler.   arthur.   mom.  a big, hairy spider stepped on my face  and we'll stay up late.   mom: are you two asleep up there.  yes, mom.      is something wrong, d.w..  arthur's friend is coming.  it will be like having two arthurs.    arthur: don't you want to play egyptian princess.  first you're a princess.  then you're a mummy.  no.  go away.  mom.  maybe i'll spend the weekend at grandma's.  brain.  hi, arthur.  we're off to the ice creamers' convention.  she's nominated for best new flavor: cucumber crunch.  ew.  well, good luck.  let's put your stuff in my room.  look out.  a giant mad dog.     oh, no, his tongue is poison.  time for dinner, men.  look how neatly alan keeps his clothes.  yeah, sure, mom.  i'm done.  let's play.  may i be excused, mrs. read.  of course, alan.  dinner was delicious, mr. read.  oh, yeah, great, dad.  shouldn't we do homework first, arthur.  why.  it's not due till monday.  if we do it now we'll have the weekend free to read next week's lessons.  next week's lesson.  that's very sensible, alan.  oh, all right.  are you giving up.  i'm done.  can i look at your answers.  yes but you learn by doing it yourself.  i can finish later.  let's play.   brain: my game.   ready to play again.  you beat me 30 games to none.  maybe i'll go do my homework.  is it okay if i keep shooting.  i shoot 100 free throws every night for practice.  you weren't just born good.   no.  want to sneak down and watch curse of the puppet sister.  wouldn't your folks be mad.  i think we'd better sleep.  it's while you sleep you grow.  i'd rather be short and watch scary movies.  d.w.: look at this.  while you were tying your shoes the brain taught pal new tricks.    i always thought that dog was dumb.  i guess it was just you, arthur.  i'm done first.  i beat you.  mr. read, you could accomplish that much more efficiently.  dad: that's fantastic isn't it, arthur.  yeah, dad.  mayonnaise is wild.  let's play a game, brain.  this is my favorite game but no one likes to play with me.  see.  when you delete these files everything runs faster.  that's great.  arthur, alan reprogrammed my computer.  oh, great.  i'll be in the yard with the game.  brain: rapunzel, rapunzel, let down your hair.  arthur: brain.  here she is, putting all her hair out the window.  she must use truckloads of shampoo.  hey, brain, the game is set up.  he can't play now.  he's reading.  you never wantme to read to you.  brain reads faster.  i wish he could always live here.  brain: i'll be there as soon as i'm done.  where's the brain.  i don't know... my house.  why don't you want him playing with us.  because he's always being smarter than me, neater than me.  he eveneatsbetter than i do.   why can'tyouchew your food like alan.  the brain is nice.  he wouldn't make you look bad on purpose.  you're right.  i guess it's not his fault my family likes him better.  i had to go to buster's for something.  hi, pal.  pal must have thought i was you.  arthur.  did you finish that homework.  sort of.  no.  i'll go do it.   mom: this game is fun.  when i played with arthur, it was boring.  he didn't read all the rules like you, alan.  mom: that weekend went by quickly.  it sure didsee you.  your parents are lucky to have a son like you.  and i'll bet they're anxious to see you again.  arthur kate said her first word this morning: "brain." want to make popcorn at my house.  no, i'm going home.  are you mad, arthur.  who could be mad at you.  you're perfect.  i'm home.  mother: hello, alan.  did you have fun.  yeah, we'll put my clothes in my room.  whoa.  i don't believe it.  you were so neat in my house.  it almost killed me.  i was a guest in your house. ihad to be polite.  want some popcorn.  okay.  need a hand.  why, thank you, arthur.  alan, you could take a few lessons from arthur.  huh.  hi, everyone, it's me, buster.  if you like all the traditions we have in elwood city, you'll love what i've seen on my travels with my dad.  there are all sorts of cool things other kids are doing with their families and friends to celebrate their way of life.  i've filmed amazing things with my video camera and i'm
