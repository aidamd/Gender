"wish mojo".  that's ridiculous.  buster: step aside.  give the boy room.  would you wish on my rabbit's foot.  i need an a in geography.  i want a jet pack.  this way, george.  have a seat.  comfy.  can i get you a pillow.  want my pudding.  um...  no thanks.  well, okay.  atta boy.  so, jenna's birthday is this weekend.  oh, really.  she really wants you to come to her party.  and she wants you to make her birthday wish.  what..  i can't do that.  sure you can.  she wants snow as much as we do.  and not a few flurries this time.  abigsnow.  schoolclosing snow.  wait a minute, what if that cupcake thing was just a coincidence.  oh, ye of little faith...  george, you'll do fine.  you've got wish mojo.  here.  have another pudding.  bigsnow, got it.   those penguins sound angry.  oh, they are.  it's been months without snow.  if kids get upset without snow, imagine how penguins feel.  be calm, angry penguins.  george the wisher king will grant your wish.  lower the royal wishbone.  all ready, sire.  pull.  whoa.  his majesty wins.  okay, you're up.  i wish for snow.  where's the snow.  you lied to us.  get him..   it's been a pleasure serving you.  i hereby resign.  no.  it's not my fault.  it's not my fault.  it's not my fault.   happy birthday, jenna.  really sorry i can't stay, but i think i have a cold...  there he is.  the boy of the hour.  i've been keeping your seat nice and warm.  try to get them all out on one blow.  it's more powerful that way.  and remember, no cupcakes.   well, okay...   prunella: wait.  what are you doing.  you can't give a birthday wish to someone else.  you can't.  no.  it's terrible luck.  don't tell me you've never heard the ancient rhyme: "snuff the candle on another's cake, and endless misery ye shall make." no.  must've missed that one.  well, there's nothing for me to wish on now, so i guess that's that.  wait.  there's one more thing we can try.  george: but the water's frozen.  we should come back when it thaws.  francine: thanks, prunella.  she says the wish should come true as long as the coin stays on the ice.  all right, george.  it's time.  make snow.    wish.  quick.  uh...  phew.  nice work, george.  yeah, great throw.  now all we have to do is wait.  phew.       george.  there he is.  hey, george.  you did it.  you made snow.  schoolclosing snow.  i knew you could do it.  but...  i didn't do it.  that's what i like about you, george.  you're so modest.  no, i mean it.  i didn't wish for snow.  i... i got all flustered when the coin was going to roll off, and, well, i forgot to.  then how do you explain all this.  um, because it's winter.  who cares why it snowed.  i'm just glad it did.  snowball fight.  it's okay.  we've been putting a lot of pressure on you.  from now on, you can wish for whatever you want.  so long as it's what i want, too.   you really didn't wish for snow.  nope.  so what did you wish for.  a great rest of the year.  huh.  well, you know what.  i bet you it comes true.  snowball fight.  oh, yeah.  two can play at that game.    and now...  hi, my name is elena.  welcome to arlington center for the arts summer camp.  today is hot.   whoo. it's hot in here.  elena: and we're trying to cool down.  arthur and his friends are wishing for snow, and so are we.  the arlington center for the arts hereby declares a snow day.   teacher: with the materials you can find, we will transform this room into a winter wonderland.  girl: we're making winter in july.  we're making snow angels by tracing each other and then decorating them.  i'm feeling cooler already.   elena: we're making it colder.  brrr.  i am making a snowman out of balloons.  tada.  that worked.  this is shiny the snowman.  we're making snow globes, where you put some glitter in a jar and then we're going to put some water in it, and then we're going to seal it with a lid.  we're making a winter wonderland in a jar.  elena: and we're making paper snowflakes.  you cut out pieces of the paper and when you unfold it, it looks like a snowflake.  pretty cool, huh.  it's getting colder in here.  brrr.  elena: we didn't need luck or wishes to make it snow, just a little creativity.  ah, it's snowing.  we made it snow in july.  snowball fight.  bye.  and now...  coach : good afternoon, little ladies of elwood.  i am boris belinsky.  but you can call me "bellow." i have coached nine girls to olympic gold medals.  you may clap now.  marina: isn't this exciting.  thebellow, coaching a gymnastics team in our town.  i've never heard of him, but if you're excited, i'm excited.  enough.  flattery will not get you on this team.  what will.  strength, flexibility, and, above all, heart.  i want tigers, not mice.  who is first.  now, remember why you're here.  when bellow gives me the signal, you whisper "go." got it.  are you sure it's a good idea not to tell the coach you're blind.  i've been taking gymnastics classes since i was little.  i'm going to make this team because i'm good, not because someone feels sorry for me.  go.  you next.  uh, me.  i'm not trying out.  you are in gym during my practice.  yes...  then you are trying out.  go.  well... i do practice yoga.  enough.  i will now announce the lucky girls i have chosen.  katie, carol...  sue ellen...  and... marina.  yes. yes.  and one more.  yoga girl.   marina: i can't believe i made the team.  imagine howifeel.  the only flip i've ever done is when i slipped on my crystal ball.  well, bellow's the best, and he said you're a natural.  since my mom and i drive right past your house, we can pick you up for practice before school.   i'm sorry, i thought you saidbeforeschool.  i did.  we practice every morning at 6:00 sharp.  there's a 6:00 in the morning.   marina: that's my ride.  here.  it's bellow's audiobook.  for inspiration.  see you at 5:30 a.m..  "the tiger of the tundra." bellow :life was not easy for a little gymnast in my country.  i walked many kilometers to the gym, through snowdrifts so high i could not see.  but the dream of olympic gold lit my way.  mom: prunella.  bedtime.  bellow : the pushup is your pal.  every morning i started with 200 pushups.  chapter 23: leotards are for lions.  history is being made tonight at the olympics, ladies and gentlemen, where superstar gymnast prunella "the natural" deegan is wowing the crowd.  i've never seen anything like it.  francine: believe it or not, prunella is attempting all four events at the same time.  buster: can you believe she just started doing gymnastics last week..    francine: ooh, that's gotta hurt.  "the natural" is disqualified for going over time...  over time... over time...   no. i overslept.  i'm sorry, marina.  i'll be on time tomorrow.  i promise.  it's okay.  anyone can make a mistake.  once.  yeah.  i'm sure no one will even notice we're late.   you're late, little mice.  i'm sorry, sir, it won't happen again.  let me ask you girls a question.  how many times do you think my greatest champion, nadia comeinimgladtomeetcha, came late to practice.  um... 12.  zero times.  you both now have one strike.  three strikes, you're out.   okay, everyone, back to work.  if gymnastics were easy, they'd call it football.   sorry.  not a morning person.  ...eight, nine, ten.  i can't look.    : marina...  he gave you the signal two minutes ago.  i know, i know.    time to go.  marina, are you okay.  yep. great.  gotta practice.  bye.  what happened today at the uneven bars.  are they too hard for you.  i can do anything other people can do.  sometimes i just have to work a little bit harder.  now if you'll excuse me...  ooh, i like what you did with your room.  nice trapeze bar.  my mom hung it for me.  to help me with the, um...  the uneven bars.  you can tell me.  i'm... afraid of them.  i can't see the bar above my head, and i get scared that when i jump up, there'll be nothing to grab on to.   hold that thought.  prunella. muffy.  tonight, my house.  henry skreever and the giblets of jeopardyin gastrovision.  no way.  that sounds amazing.  what's gastrovision.  muffy: only the most excitingdevelopment in cinema since the inventionof the movie screen.   tell me more.  every time a character eats somethingin the movie, you eat it in real life.  prunella: even magical smelly beans.  i am so there.  see you tonight.   sorry, you were saying....   marina.  muffy: hold onto your bibs, kids.  the muffy megaplex proudly presents the film and food extravaganza of your life, henry skreever in gastrovision.   azalea parsley :breakfast is in your bedroom beneath the sink,henrygruel.  persephone :for luck in tomorrow's trigizzard tournament,henry...karma cake.  mmm.   jon weasley:stop.  that's not multifruit potion,it's pixie puke.  girls: ew.   prunella: thanks, muffy.  that was fun and filling.  muffy: you're leaving.  but i've gothenry skreever and the gremlin's gallstone.  let's make it a double feature.  gremlin's gallstone...  i can't pass that up.   not again.  prunella: it was a henry skreever double feature.  what could i do.  make a commitment to this.  you're late, and you're baly tryg in practice.  well, excuse me for having a life, miss perfect.  you know, gymnastics isn't everything.  it is to me.  then maybeyouneed to get out more.  maybe you need to get out... of this car.  i will.  after it stops moving.   strike two.   yoga girl, no resting in gymnastics.  is there sleeping.  because i'm bushed.  you know what, yoga girl.  you have the talent, but do you have the fire in the belly for this sport.  well, i did eat a lot of really gross stuff last night.  no, i mean maybe you don't have passion for gymnastics like your blind friend.  prunella: how do you know she's blind.  bellow knows all, sees all.  and her mother called me.  that girl is the bravest tiger in this gym.  i don't know if i don't care enough about gymnastics or if i'm just lazy.  tough question.  but i tell you thiswhen you find what you really care about, be like the tiger.  don't let anything keep you from it.  marina, you can have my headband.  i won't be needing it anymore.  i hope it takes you all the way to the olympics.  finally, a night free of responsibility.  what are we doing, girls.  sorry, it has to be an early night for me.  big soccer game against mighty mountain tomorrow.  and i have a big badminton match against bailey.   i can't believe i'm the tenth girl bellow has coached to an olympic gold medal.  it's like he always says: you're either a tiger, or a little mouse.      great, now i wake up on time.   huh.   prunella: marina.  what happened.  can you believe it.  car trouble.  strike three.  when you find what you really care about, be like the tiger.  don't let anything keep you from it.
