 ""he hey.   what a wonderful kind of day    hey. what a wonderful kind of day.   hey.  arthur: hey, d.w.  hey.  whoa.   soldiers: hut, hut, hut, hut hut, hut, hut, hut.  ah, finally, the summit.   it's beautiful, sir.   is that a comb.  general: no, son, that's just a hair clip.  well, no time for sightseeing.  all right, you lousy bunch of bugs.  i want to see a nit on every single hair in a teninch radius.  now.  lice: hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut.  general: mmhmm, yes.  good job.  uh, general.  you've never actually seen a comb, have you.  yes, i've seen a comb, son.  in fact, it took off my fifth leg.  but i lived.  and i'll keep on living until we've conquered every head in this entire city.  we are lice, son.  and nothing can ever get rid of us.  nothing.  lly)  hey.  oops.  nice hair.  thanks.  not hisyours.  ilovethose purple highlights.    sorry.  muffy: francine.  i'm open, i'm open.   muffy, you said you were open.  you could have scored.  i'm sorry, francine.  it's this darn itchy head.  it's been bothering me all day.  go to the nurse.  it might be head lice.  my sister had it and it started with an itch.  i couldn't have head lice.  that's something that dirty people get.  that's not true.  look at buster.  he's never had head lice.  muffy: you see, suzette, my nanny, washes my hair every day so i couldn't have...   thatwas in my hair.  i'm afraid so.  help. i'm covered in bugs.  actually, head lice only live on the head.  what if the other kids find out.  i'll be treated like a "leopard".  i'll be "ostrichized".  muffy.  i have your math homework.     oh, ms. flynn, promise you won't tell anyone.  please, please, please.  calm down, muffy.  if you and your parents follow my instructions you'll be able to get rid of the lice.  hi.  francine, what are you doing here..  i wanted to see what the nurse said.  so, do you have head lice.  me. head lice.  i don't have head lice.  the nurse said that i was just...  thinking too hard.  uh, why are we here.  what's the meaning of life.  which came first, the chicken or the egg.  hey, muffy.  you dropped your hat.  ooh. so soft.  get ready.  the new head is approaching.  head for the scalp.  on the double.  lice: hut. hut. hut. hut.  hut. hut. hut. hut.  general: contact.  francine: mmm.  : bend your head.  we have to put the "nit hit" lice shampoo on.   this is the worst thing that's ever happened to me.  life is so unfair.  muffy, dear, you're overreacting.  evenihad head lice when i was a child.  ah, yes, i remember it well.   this is the worst thing that's ever happened to me.  life is so unfair.  you'll have to stay home tomorrow and we'll have to get everything cleanedthe sheets and towels, your clothes...  even the carpet.  of course, we could use this as an opportunity to redecorate.  yippee.  francine: have you seen muffy.  i have her hat.  nomaybe she's out sick today.  hey, that's really pretty.  nice hat.  scrumptious.  oh, it feels so expensive.   i have an important announcement.  yesterday, a case of head lice was reported at school.  this week, you will all have to have your hair checked by me every morning.   i knew it.  muffy did have head lice.  also, it's very important that you do not wear anybody else's coats, scarves or hats.  we want to try and keep the head lice from spreading.  lice: hut, hut, hut, hut.  lieutenant: we landed four days ago, sir.  we now have bugs on ten heads.  excellent.  soon, the entire school will be at our feet.   what's that smell, sir.  hair gel, son.  isn't it wonderful.   ah. i love the smell of hair gel in the morning.  it smells like...   general, what's happening.  help. help. help. help....  sorry, nigel.  oh...  i knew i should have gone to business school.  all: hut, hut, hut, hut.  this'll do the trick.  mayonnaise.  you're going to put mayonnaise on my head.  sure. it's what your grandma used on me when i was a kid.  d.w. : haha.  mayohead. mayohead.  cut it out.  daddy, now put cheese and tomatoes on arthur's head.  that's right, laugh it up, d.w.  you won't find it so funny in a minute.  you're next.  me.  why me.  i don't have head mice.  they're called headlice,honey.  and we all might have them.  mom: i'm sorry, d.w.  but there may be lice hiding in their fur.  it'll only be for a few weeks.  weeks..  wait.  there.  so the animals can breathe.  goodbye, poofles.  goodbye, moomoo.  goodbye, tooky.  i'll never forget any of you.  cut it out, boy.  dad. pal, keeps trying to eat my head.   i can't wait for this to be over.   hut, hut, hut, hut.  binky: so, let me get this straight.  i get to watch tv for hours and hours instead of doing homework.  rightyou've got a ton of nits and they're very hard to get out.  this is so cool.  i love lice.  i'm clean.  i'm clean.  ooh. ooh.  oops. sorry, francine.  you should be.  it was an accident.  i didn't mean to knock you down.  not for that.  for giving me lice.  i can't get rid of them.  we've tried everything.  well, you must be doing something wrong.  yeah, talking to you.  you started this whole thing.  you probably have a million lice by now.  for your information, ms. frensky i am nit free.  so, ha.  muffy: you're doing it all wrong.  i wanted the big dipper above mybed.    un pou.  gesundheit.  no, muffy.  the lice, they are back.  but... but that's impossible.  man: did you know that this old cigar box you were going to throw out is actually worth $37.  thirtyseven dollars.  well, bless my toes.  i can't take it anymore.  five straight nights of mindless television.  can i go to bed, please, mom.  not yet, honey.  : oh.  now we're using olive oil.  it seems to work, and pal doesn't eat it.  well, i hope it works.  i wonder why i haven't gotten head lice.  everybody else seems to have them.   this place is disgusting.  louse: let's go back to the teacher's head.  muffy: i didn't give you lice.  you gavemelice.  but you gave them back to me.  prove it.  prove you didn't.  brain: hey, calm down, you guys.  i've been doing some research on head lice.  the articles say it's impossible to tell who gave it to whom.  but lice can be harder to get rid of when you have long hair.  they said we were going to look like models.  we doboy models.  hmm.  we might be able to do some pretty fun things with this haircut.  francine: hey, binky, any nits.  nope.  i never thought i'd say this but it's good to be back in school.  you said it.  hey, you can't...  you're in the...    two weeks since our forces landed and now i'm the last louse alive.  the school has defeated us.  the bunny.  if i can just get to his head, i can hatch a new army.  i will survive.  buster: hey, george.  going to get your head checked.    louse: help me. help me.   and now...  i know that head lice can make your head very itchy.  but i'm really interested in mosquitoes.   i'm going to the mosquito lab to learn more about mosquitoes.  i'm al, and you're vondell.  yeah.  al: i'm al gettman rhode island mosquito abatement coordinator.  we capture mosquitoes every week and test them.  vondell: they trap lots and lots of mosquitoes and check them, because mosquitoes can carry diseases.  an infected mosquito could bite and make somebody sick.  vondell: i learned the different stages in the life of a mosquito.  adult mosquitoes lay their eggs in puddles or in artificial containers and they hatch into these wigglers which are calledmosquito larvae.  they live like thatfor about a week.  then after that, they become...  a pupa.  right, exactly.  and the pupa lives for two or three days...  and then it changes into a mosquito.  that's right, becomes an adult mosquito.  it's a bloodfeeding insect.  only females drink the blood.   gettman: well, that's what she needs to form her eggs.  not very nice, though, is it.  vondell: al showed me how the trap works.  the mosquito is attracted to the light bulb and you see the fan right there.  vondell: the light attracts mosquitoes.  the fan pulls them down, and they're trapped in the net.  could she get out.  no.  michelle separates them into different groups.  this one has a brown head.  very good.  vondell: for protection spray mosquito repellent on yourself wear longsleeved shirts and long pants.  kids:..  treasure island, one of my favorite books.  when i read it, i imagine i'm a pirate like long john silver.  avast. thar's the "x." dig up the buried treasure, lad.  human treasure, lad, not dog treasure.  keep digging.  okay, you can stop digging now.  imagining i'm someone else is one of the things i love about reading.  but i wonder what it'd be like if i could actually besomeone else like mr. ratburn.   good morning, class.  let's start the day off with a little math quiz.   ratburn:.. that wasn't a very big groan.  maybe i'm getting too soft on them.  on second thought, let's start the day with abigmathtest.   ah. that's more like it.  hey, i have an idea.  why don't you imagine what it's like to be me for a day and i'll imagine what it's like to be you.  okay, ready.  : you are becoming me...  you are becoming me...  you are becoming me...  you are becoming me...   arthur: ten toes, ten fingers.  yep, i'm all here.     good morning, arthur.  d.w.: arthur.  stop talking to yourself.  do you have any idea what time it is.  it's only 7:30.  oh, so that's what it says.  well, you better get moving or you'll be late for training.  training. for what.   the 3k raceit's today.  oh, no, i completely forgot i signed up for it.  care to enter the library's 3k race, arthur.  it's to raise money for a new children's reading room.  gee, i don't know.  how far is three kilometers.  brain: it's exactly 1.86 miles.  the most we've ever run in school is half a mile.  it might be too long for you.  so, why are you signing up.  my dad and i run a the weekends.  three kilometers will be a snap for me.  arthur: huh. too long for me.  we'll see about that.   3k, huh.  no sweat.  1.86 milesthat really seems like a lot now but i'd like to show the brain i can run just as far as he can.  i guess a little training couldn't hurt.  arthur: ouch. ouch.  hey.  ow.  ow. you're hurting me.  d.w.: it's for your own good, arthur.  you should stretch before your trainers get here.  trainers.  i thought you were my trainer.  hi, arthur.  ready for your workout.  arthur: oh, no.  trust me, arthur.  if you can survive an hour with them, the race will be a snap.    : i've got you now.  arthur: that was close.  not close enough.  no.   .. 19...  .. 20... 20...  arthur: you already said 20.  i don't know what comes after 20.  tommy: hey, timmy.  i bet i can spin the rope faster than you.  timmy: cannot.  can, too.  cannot.  arthur: hey, guys, slow down.  it's too fast.  i can't keep up.  stop.  aah.  d.w.: arthur...  never say "stop" when you're jumping rope.   okay, run to that tree.  and back.  now to the sandbox.   pick up the purple dinosaur.  now bring it back... quick.   thanks.   d.w.: hey. they stole my dinosaur.   arthur wants some more pancakes, dad.  arthur: i do.  you need lots of crabs so you'll have energy for the race.  "carbs," d.w.  it's short for "carbohydrates." d.w.: trust me, arthur.   i ate too much.  mom, could you slow down.  i feel a little carsick.  you know, arthur, if you feel nauseous you don't have to run.  i could just skip the race.  but what if the library can't raise enough money for the children's reading room.  isn't it wonderful.  it certainly is.   man: haney, this is the foreman of the building crew.  you are five dollars short so we had to leave out some features like doors and windows.  wait, don't go.  i have five dollars right here.  foreman: throw in another ten, and we'll give you a roof, too.   we're doomed.  and it's all because arthur signed up for the race but didn't run.  hmm.  no, i should run.  i feel okay.  d.w.: i know what you need, arthur.  let's see... i had it just last week.  something to settle your stomach.   arthur: eww.  mom, pull over... quick.  hi, arthur.  you don't look quite yourself today.  arthur: really.  i was a little carsick on the ride over but now i feel fine.  no, that's not it.  is there someone inside your head watching everything you do on a tv set.   arthur: cut it out.  hey, arthur.  arthur: whoa.  brain: oh, these are my new condor 86x low riders with pump action.  they inflate when i clap my hands...   and give me an extra spring to my step.  arthur: oh, yeah.  well, these are my, uh, lucky sneakers.  i wear them for all my races.  well, don't push yourself too hard.  remember, arthur,walkingacross the finish line still counts.  arthur: yeah, but finishing before you would be a lot of fun.  on your mark...  wait.  isn't theelwood city times covering the race.  i want to look my be.  ahem.  on your mark, get set...    oh, no.    huh. hey.  arthur: hi, grandma.  hi... brain.  hmm.  how did you...  sorry, can't talk now.  got to run.    actually, this isn't so bad.  i don't feel tired at all.  hey, i might even win this race.   congratulations, arthur.  yours was the fastest time in elwood city history.  and we've decided to name the new reading room the read reading room, after you.  you ran a great race.  you should be very proud of yourself.  you're doing really well.  you know, we should run together someday.  arthur: okay.  but not today.    yoohoo, over here.  try to get my good side.  arthur: muffy, watch out.  there's a...  muffy: ow.  ow.   arthur: muffy, are you all right.  : no, i'm not all right.  my new outfit is ruined.  arthur: i'll never catch up with the brain now.  oh, well, there will be other races.    d.w.: come on, arthur.  just a few more steps.  you can do it.    dad: yay.  way to go. that's my boy.  arthur: thanks.   d.w.: don't drink too much, arthur.  you don't want to practice on a full stomach.  arthur: practice.  for what.  the marathon, of course.  it can't be much longer than this race.  maybe it's ten ks or four ls or a q.  we'll ask tommy and timmy this afternoon.  arthur: oh, brother.   wow. check it out.  i'm famous.  that's even better than winning the race.  well, i hope you enjoyed being me for a day.  i really liked being you.  but next time, let's switch.  you run the race, and i'll watch me on tv.  you might want to knowthe secret formula for drawing arthur.  we'll do two letter o's, hook them together with a littleupsidedown letter u.  then we'll do a largerletter u like this.  we'll do a straight line here.  two dots here.  two lines here.  two dots here.  a curved line for his mouth.  i will add his ears.  and there's arthur.  that's great.  captioned bymedia access group at wgbh visit us online at pbskidsgo.org.  you can findarthurbooks and lots of other books, too, at your local library.    what a wonderful kind of day    if we could learn to work and play    and get along with each other    you got to listen to your heart    listen to the beat    listen to the rhythm, the rhythm of the street    it's a simple message and it comes from the heart    believe in yourself    for that's the place to start    and i say hey.   hey.   what a wonderful kind of day    if we could learn to work and play    and get alongwith each other.   hey.  hey.  chuck e. cheese's, proud supporter of pbs kids.  who know when it comes to learning how to be fit for your life, you're never too young to start.  pbs kids, where a kid can be a kid.  and by a ready to learntelevision cooperative agreement from the u.s. departmentof education through the publicbroadcasting service.  and by contributionsto your pbs station from: likearthur, love ruffman.  man, am i excited about the brandnew cast members.  whoopdedee.   we put the pedal to the metal, baby. yes.  okay, here we go....   watchfetch. with ruff ruffman, weekdays on pbs kids go.  or watch it anytime online at pbskidsgo.org.  i can't stop reading.  school, oneway, bakery, pizza, circus.  no dogs allowed, eat, open, stop.  i can't stop reading.  pbs kids. )
