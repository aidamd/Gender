 mmm.  change can be an improvement.  d.w. watched so many kitty cornervideos that she started acting like a cat.  meow.  arthur: d.w., down.  for one whole week i could get her to do whatever i wanted.  look, d.w., a mouse.    arthur: but if somebody changes too much...  well, then it's time for drastic action.   i bet mr. ratburn assigns another report today.  yeah, he hasn't assigned one since...  yesterday.  this report should be two pages on any animal you choosewhere they live, what they eat, anything unusual.  the teams for the report will be: arthur read and...    buster: maybe it won't be that bad.  oh, thank you, daddy.  you're wonderful.   arthur, over here.  for the report my father will take us whale watching.  arthur and i are going to be spending a lot of time together on my yacht.  come on, arthur.  arthur: whoa.    see anything.  no.  you.  water.   lots of water.  boring.  we didn't see a thing.  we're going again today.  what am i going to do.  you can say you're sick.  that's it. you're a genius.  tell us everything, arthur,everything.  muffy's boat wasn't that fancy, was it.  huh.  was there a chandelier. fancy chocolates.  hmph. i bet muffy's yacht doesn't even have a pool.  well, actually... it did, but...  really.  both: cool.  you are so lucky.  i'd give anything to go on muffy's yacht.  really.  come on, arthur, the yacht's waiting.  arthur can't go today, muffy.  he's sick.  oh... okay.  whatever.  wait. i'm feeling better.  i feel great.  arthur...  are you really going.  are you kidding.  some people would give anything to go on muffy's yacht.  see anything.   it's wilbur rabbithe plays bionic bunny.  quit kidding around.  ahoy there.  who... me.  wilbur: our engine conked out.  can you give us a lift to shore.  wow.  arthur: ilbur told me "artie, those are swell glasses." of course, they are exactly like his.  the odds of meeting bionic bunny are minuscule.  meet him. arthur rescued him.  arthur rescued bionic bunny.  he might have been lost at sea forever.  others: wow.  he'll mention that when we're both on tv tonight.  even way out at sea, my adoring fans manage to find me.  hey, that's me.  and my head was like this big on muffy's hid tv.  buster: man.  brain, arthur was on tv last night with bionic bunny.  i don't remember seeing that on the news.  it wasn't on the news. it was on the celebrities at sea network.  that's on satellite tv.  oh.  don't you have satellite tv.  well, no, we...  muffy does.  maybe she'll even invite you over sometime.  "we the people..." hey, that sounds good.  "who are friends of wilbur rabbit..." "pledge to..." prunella: hi, what are you doing.  we're making up the pledge for our new club.  really.  cool.  the wilbur rabbit society.  can we join.  we love bionic bunny.  his name is wilbur.  he only plays bionic bunny on tv.  everybody knows that.  and besides, the club is for friends only.  that means only people who actuallyknowwilbur can join.  "with liberty and justice for..."  oops.   arthur, muffy, let's play.  and get my new dress dirty.  i don't think so.  come on, arthur.  we've... got better things to do, don't we.  things where you don't get dirty.  oops.  muffy: ahem.  are you going to eat that.  it's been on the ground.  but it's in a bag.  it didn't really get dirty.  well, it's your choice if you want to eat a "germwich." vomitrocious.  arthur, i'll take it.  my mother only gave me one sandwich.  some people will eat anything.   arthur, you dropped a book.  aren't you going to pick it up.  ahem.  it's just a book.  it can be replaced.  i can't be bothered with every little thing.  besides, it's all dirty now.  vomitrocious.  did you see that.  arthur loves books.  what's the matter with him.  brain: hey, arthur, wait up.  arthur, you...  of course, you can have my autograph.  sorry, i have to go now.  no more autographs.   huh.  binky, arthur's gone haywire.  or should i say "crosswire".  arthur, let's go to the arcade.  they've got "planet smasher." it's supposed to be cool.  sorry, can'tthe wilbur rabbit society meets today.  great. where are we meeting.  you have to be a friend of wilbur's to join.  that's the rulefriends only.  but... i'm your friend, aren't i, arthur.  it's for wilbur'sfriends.  oh.   in case you haven't noticed arthur has turned into muffy.  yeah, he's gone crosswire.  i want arthur back.  he has to be demuffyfied.  yeah, but how.  we better think fast before it spreads to us.  waitthat's it, buster.  we can save arthur.  yeahlisten, everyone.  what we're going to do is...   maybe he's not coming.  shh.  get ready.  how darling would this hat be on me.  oh, look.  i remember when i used to play that silly game.  eww. i'm not touching that.  it's been in dirt.  vomitrocious.  keep that away from me.  i'm too tired to go all the way to home plate.  i'll stop here.  what's the matter with everyone.  they're all acting like... like...  i want to pitch to someone who doesn't hit so hard.  buster, you next.  this glove is hideous.  it doesn't go with my outfit at all.  they're acting like...  you.  arthur, the bionic bunny club is meeting tonight to watch the show.  great. what time should i come over.  sorry, arthurthe club's forbionic bunnyfans not wilbur rabbit's friends.  they're not acting like me, arthur.  they're acting like you.  like...  : don't you have satellite tv.  the club is for... friends only.  vomitrocious.  friends only.  but i...  everyone, listeni didn't mind it when arthur started copycatting me, but this is too much.  i know you all want to be like me but there's only one me.  i'm sorry.  vomitro...  arthur: uhoh.    okay if i play.  sure.  nice outfit.  now let's really play some ball.   arthur: i think muffy's right.  one muffy is more than enough.  want to come to my house and watchbionic bunny.  sure.  the more i think about it, it's really true.  this horrid glove totally clashes with my outfit.  vomitrocious.  kids: and now...  arthur tries to act like muffy.  arthur should take an acting class.  you are going to be the king.  i am king christopher.  this is the storybook class.  teacher: okay, everybody, get a costume.  we're rehearsing a play.  i have a gift for you.  it is this magic diamond.  girl: we're in acting class and we're learning how to act.  what do u think your name is going to be.  princess sirana.  oh.  yeah, i'm an actor but actors act like somebody else.  you don't want tobe like somebody else.  i am princess sirana.  don't slouch, don't slouch.  acting is like pretending.  the diamond's gone.  you just use your imagination and put on costumes.  if you want to be a good actor you have to have a lot of concentration.  both: announcing a ball for our grand daughters.  teacher: one more time.  announcing a ball for our lovely daughters.   no, agrandball.  announcing a grand ball for our lovely daughters.  i like acting because it's really fun.   the diamond, father.  girl: if you want to act become an actor.   and now...   you know, some people just have to do everything themselves.  cut, cut, cut.  i'm sorry, arthur, i have to stop you.  this is too boring.  boring.  but...  you need a little enthusiasm here.  shape the line.  this is the opening of the show.  try it again.  some people...  just have to do...  everythingthemselves.  that was it.  that's enthusiastic.  yeah.  well... that was practice.   some people just have to do everything themselves.  how was that.  brai ase, take seven.  you know, some people just have to do everything themselves.  they won't let anybodyhelp them.  i think that's much better.  okay, that's a wrap.  cue the title.  yeah.  i hope mr. ratburn assigns another report.  are you kidding.  we finished one yesterday.  no way will he give us another report.  this report should be at least two pages on any animalwhere they live, what they eat and anything unusual.  the teams for the report will be as follows: arthur read and... muffy crosswire.  alan, your partner will be sue ellen.   sue ellen: a model dinosaur.  that's a great idea, brain.  i'll do some preliminary sketches.  what should i do.  the sketches have to be done first.  i'll call you when i'm done.  great.  so long.  sue ellen: i've never worked with brain.  it should be fun.  it'll be easy.  how do you mean.  you'll see, sue ellen.  brain is the type that...  brain's the best report partner i ever had.  well, i'm your partner this time, buster and i'm not brain.  come on.  we're going to the library.  sue ellen, don't you have homework.  not yet.  brain's doing the sketches.  they're preliminary.  well, maybe i'll call him and see how it's going.  this is going to be fantastic.  brain : even when i built my first model i knew that with a little dna and a lot of hard work i would one day succeed.  and now...  it lives.   please. i implore you, be calm.   : he so, the strangest thing happened to me.  last night, i discovered an elephant in my pajamas.  how he got in there, i'll never know.   hmm... i have to work on his material.   hello.  i just called to find out how the sketches are going.  we're ready for the next stage.  great. i was worried i was going to have to watch tv all week.  what do you want me to do.  you. uh, well...  maybe you should... continue watching tv.  got to go do some research. bye.   very weird.  this is our model of atyrannosaurus rex.  and i helped.  the arms are made of cookies and the body is made out of cake.   ratburn: unfortunately, this isn't a cooking class.  you fail.   sue ellen: he hung up the phone on me.  well, i can't even find buster.  i hope he doesn't think i'll do the whole report myself.  i hope brain realizes i expect to share the work.  i don't mind working.  brain, is that you.  what.  no... i mean...  that's strange.  he vanished.  that was close.  you're telling me.  you almost gave away my position.  the brain's probably just strange because he's been working too hard.  it could be he's not getting enough sleep.         aah.  must keep working.  must keep working.  i thought you were going home.  brain can't do this report alone.  wow. did brain ask you for help.  no, i'll surprise him.  he'll be surprised, all right.  phew.   i came to help you with the research.  that's all done.  look.  wow, that's great.  what now, brain.  i need to finish the vertebrae and then the head.  we can make that with papiermache.  um... clay is better.  okay, i have clay.  i'll go get started on the head.   i'm afraid you're going to be in third grade for a long time, alan.     i brought the...  what's the matter.  you look tired.  : working late.  i have something to show you.  voila.  uh, it looks great, but...  i thought i was making the head.  i decided to take care of it.  i'm sorry you went to all that trouble for nothing.  we can't use this.  what.  that head is all wrong.  the proportions of the nasal cavities are way off.  no, mr. ratburn would never accept this.  they look exactly the same.  maybe to the untrained eye.  it's supposed to be ourproject, brain.  yours, mine, ours...  i don't have time to argue.  i have to work to get this finished.  you want a good grade don't you.  : "the nasal cavities are all wrong." honey, are you having a bad dream.  no, a bad reality.  brain...  we have to talk about our report.  i have everything under control.  i know. that's the problem.  brain, you'll drop it.  let me help.  no, no, i can do it.  don't touch it.  that's ridiculous.  you're just being a report hog.  please, it's very delicate.  fine. take it.  whoa.  now look what you've done.  and she let you fall in the mud.   that sounds hilarious.  it was far from amusing.  lucky she only let you fallin the mud.  i would have pushed you.  well, i'm kind of rude.  but you, brain.  you're a report hog.  like last year on our french history report...  you were napoleon, i was france and you gave me no lines.  shh.  even when we were little, you always had to do everything.  how would you like sue ellen to treat you that way.  don't touch that.  you're fiddling with my precious aplus.  you don't know what you're doing.  go home.  i guess i would feel pretty bad if somebody didn't trust me.  well, i'm sorry i called you a report hog.  now we have no report to hog.  our model is wrecked.  maybe, but our report will be better than ever.  how.  trust me.  okay.  "the largest mammal on earth." very good, well done.  alan and sue ellen report next.  mr. ratburn, can we all go outside.  brain and i set up a special demonstration.  all right.  field trip.  we have recreated what paleontologists might find when they discover dinosaur bones.  wow, brain... this is cool.  it was really sue ellen.  now you can all dig them up but there is a proper way to do it and brain will show you how.  sue ellen is right.  you must be very careful.  this is going to take all day.  that means we can finish our report after school.  okay, i'll meet you at your house.  oh, no, you won't.  we're sticking together until it's done.  hi, everyone, it's me, buster.  we always have something to dance about in elwood city, but you won't believe all the cool dances people are doing all around the country.  on my trip with my dad, i see people rock, stomp, twirl, pop and boogie to the beat.  i'm filming all the groovy fun and sending it back to my friends in elwood city on my very own video postcards.  they'repostcards from buster.  visit us online at pbskidsgo.org.  you can findarthurbooks and lots of other books, too, at your local library.  n]  . what a wonderful kind of day .  . if we could learn to work and play .  . and get along with . you got to listen to your heart .  . listen to the beat .  . listen to the rhythm, the rhythm of the street .  . it's a simple message and it comes from the heart .  ieve in yourself . believe in yourself .  . for that's the place to start .  . and i say hey. .  . hey. what a wonderful kind of day .  . if we could learn to work and play .  . and get alongwith each other .  . hey. what a wonderfulkind of day. .  . hey. .  chuck e. cheese'sproud supporter of pbs kids, who know for safe fun, you need to make this cool move...  ...before you can makethese cool moves.  pbs kids, where a kidcan be a kid.  and by a grant from the united statesdepartment of education through the corporationfor public broadcasting and by contributionsto your pbs station from: )
