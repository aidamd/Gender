"  does it take longer to run from first to second base or second to third base.   because there's ashortstop in between.  oh, i messed up.  second to third base because there's ashortstop in between.   thank you.   ..   have you ever noticed how something big can start very little.  come on, arthur, pull.  i'm trying.   like how some guy nobody ever heard of ..  man on recording:.. .  .. .  stop it.  stop it before i go crazy and eat these cushions.  or...  can manage to have a tantrum over nothing.  : i'm sick of sunshine.  sun, sun, all the time sun.  how about some rain around here.  is that too much to ask.  .  so anyway, this whole stupid mess started over nothing.. whoa.  arthur, watch out.  don't let me go.  : oh.  uhoh.  with this homework i'll never get to watch tv.  no kidding.  and tonight's the great showdown between dark bunny and the 60foot squid.  ..  both: digested by clam juice.   and we won't get to see it.  it's so unfair.  one of these days i'm going to not do my homework.  impossible.  how would you ever face ratburn.  i just wouldn't go to school, maybe.  i'd skip school and do my homework when i felt like it.   oh, right.  youskip school.  you're too much of a scaredycat.  i am not.  i'd skip school in a minute.  .. like...   that.  oh, yeah.  i dare you.   she dared you, arthur.  you have to do it.  no, i don't.  yes, you do.  it's the rule.  what rule.  i don't make them. i just call them.  ..  i dare you back.  ..  well, then i dare buster.  me. i don't have anything to do with this.  it doesn't matter, buster.  once you're dared, you're dared.  well, then, i dare you.  this is serious, guys.  we need a plan.  okay, here's how we'll do it.  normally, we walk to school in a straight line.  but tomorrow, we'll make a right turn here, at this bush ..  ..  we don't go to school.  that's not much of a plan.  what do you want.  i only had five minutes.  i really don't think we should do this.  it was your idea, arthur.  no, it wasn't.  ..  look, it's out of our hands.  we've all been dared, and that's that.  mom: arthur, dinner.  so i guess we should just meet at the bush tomorrow.  ..  arthur.  mom called you for dinner two hours ago.  come on.  it was five seconds ago and who said you could come in here.  what are you doing, anyway.  none of your business.  we'll just see aboutthat.  mom, d.w. is staring at me.  , maybe you could take a look at those brussels sprouts instead.  arthur is much more interesting than brussels ..  sometimes.   is it safe to come in.  yeahit's a commercial.  so, has the clam eaten dark bunny.  yep.  so, are you going to tell me what you look so guilty about.  .  i don't look guilty.  .. not guilty.  don't you have homework, arthur.  i told you already.  i am not guilty.  so leave me alone already.  ..  no.  i hate clams.  .. wwh...  where am i.  clam : well, you're certainly not at school, are you.  .. no, i'm not, but i want to be.  buster: are we inside a clam.  because it really stinks in here.  where did youcome from.  i don't know, but i'm leaving.  hey, you.  let us out.  clam: too late for that.  you took a wrong turn at that bush back there ..   ew, it smells like clam juice.  ..  digested. digested.  buster. it's me.  i can't go through with it.  i don't care if francine dared me.  i can't go through with it either.  i dreamt that this giant clam told me that if i didn't go to school, i'd be digested.  and if a clam tells you to do something, you do it.  that's so weird.  i had the same dream.  arthur.  go away.  i'm on the phone.  it's a free country.  ..  : youknowwhat is canceled.  i can't talk right now.  sure thing.  see you.  okay, if you're sure.  what clam.  francine : you've reached the frenskys.  leave a message.  buster : francine. are you there.  you know the thing.   we're not going to do it.  forget about the bush, okay.   did you call everyone.  yep, it's all set.   ..  here.  ratburn:..  where's francine.  i don't know.  ..  francine.  i'm going to kill those guys.  and now it's 9:00.  shoot.  ..  did you catch it last night.  ratburn: it was scheduled oppositethe many loves of john galsworthy.  psst.  couldn't miss that.  i've got a tape if you want to take a look.  terrific.  .. psst.  francine.  what are you doing out there.  ...  .  we called it off.  didn't you get my message.  no.  and now i can't get in.    ..  : meet us at the bathroom.  francine. francine.  over here.  don't just hang there, do something.  arthur: buster do something.   ow. not so hard.  arthur, pay attention.  you're going to drop me.  i can't help it.  you're too heavy.  i am not too heavy.  i weigh less than you.   arthur, watch out.  don't let me go.  : oh.  uhoh.  sorry.  now what.  leave it to me, francine.  i have an idea.  since when does binky have ideas.  it's all set.  as soon as you hear me screaming run to the door.  why should we run to the door.  so you can open it.  sheesh.  okay, here goes.  ow.  ow. ow. ow.  ow. ow. ow.  ow. ow. ow.  what is he doing.  come on.  binky: ow. oh, mama.   francine.  over here.  you're supposed to be over here.  nuhuh.  you were supposed to be over here.  ..  hurry up.  we don't have much time.  binky: ow. ow. ow.  oh, mmma, ow, ow.    um, it's my shoe, mr. ratburn.  uh, it's too tight.  then i suggest you get a new pair.  uh, no.  no, no, no, no, no.  wait. i think it's my socks.   ..  late.   just what is going on.   what is all the commotion.  francine, why aren't you in school.  ..  .. see... uh...  you all had better come to my office immediately.  i am doomed.  buster: not necessarily.  i heard about this girl who got expelled but then she got a job selling doughnuts and now she can eat all she wants without paying.  cool.  francine: but i want to go to school.  maybe they'll only expel you for a year.  i'm sure they won't be too hard on you.  it really isn't your fault.  you can say that again.  it'syourfault.  you made me dare you and this is what happened.  i'm very disappointed in you, francine.  where on earth did you get the idea to skip school.  .. i...  it was my idea, i guess.  my stupid idea.  haney: then i'm afraid you'll have to spend all next week after school.  and this had better not happen again.  it won't.  i'm very disappointed in you, ms. frensky.  francine : i know.  wait.  this isn't fair.  it wasn't francine's idea, it was my idea.  only i never meant to do it but we got dared, and brain said we had to and it was the only way we could watch dark bunny and not do our homework.  so if francine's punished, then i should be punished.  arthur's right.  punish me, too.   and mepunish me.  you didn't have anything to do with it.  oh, yeah.  forget it.  nice try.  i applaud your spirit.  but since you made it to school i won't punish you.  .. but...  but i am glad to have a plausible explanation for why you didn't do your homework.  for that i will give you an extra assignment.  boys: yeah. all right.  busy day, rat.  a tough one, yes.  do you have the tape.  i don't comprehend why good students would choose to skip school and fall behind on their homework.  announcer: time now for your favorite "harey" hero as he battles the 60foot squid.  90 minutes of nonstop oceanic action.  all right.  this is a great one.  wait till you see the giant clam.  it's just absolutely disgusting ..  hi, everyone, it's
