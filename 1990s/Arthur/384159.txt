 t.  i call it thora's mean bean pie.  you don't even have to be a person to know bad news.  arthur: here, pal.  come on, let's go for a ride.  you think he knows about the shots.  nah, he's smart, but he can't be that smart.    and when d.w. gets an idea, well...  librarian: yes, d.w.  you have a suggestion.  how about the guy who wrote "crazy bus." argh.  hey.  of course i can watch d.w.  it's no problem at all.  thanks, thora, you're a lifesaver.  i'll pick her up about 5:00.  5:00.  oh, my, there is one problem.  i'm supposed to meet sara downtown at 4:00.  but maybe you'd like to come along to a concert, d.w.  uh, do i have any real choice in this.  none whatsoever.  : oh, boy.  a concert.  arthur: we must know a musician who can come next week.  we better find somebody before d.w. finds the "crazy bus" guy.  did i hear you say you need a musician.  sorry, they don't want somebody to play their nose.  i didn't mean me.  i meant your uncle josh.  uncle josh. why didn't i think of that.  that's a great idea, dad.  only... who's uncle josh.  well, at least i think he's your uncle.  you play your nose.  does he sing.  no.  is there a light show.  no.  does he jump around and smash his instrument.  no.  and he calls himself a musician.  come along, d.w.  how is it you know when you're about to hear the worst thing you've ever heard.   this is the best thing i've ever heard.   : all right.  whoo. yeah.   hey, come on, give it up, people.  this guy can really play.  : d.w...  the piece isn't over yet.  oh.  : sorry.  go ahead.    sureno harm in asking.  mr. frensky: i'm pretty sure he's your mother's second cousin twice removed.  he was at the family reunion a few... aha.  here he is.  he's a jazz musician.  he can play anything.  anything. anything.      : he sounds perfect.  i'll ask him if he's available.  i'm sure he'd love to do it.   : hello.  d.w.: i'm down here.  oh, hello there.  my name's d.w., mr. ma.  i thought this concert was going to stink but now i'm your biggest fan ever.  nice to meet you, d.w.  and it's nice to hear that i don't stink.  oh, you're much better than stink.  and i've got an idea that's going to make you famous.  everybody will love you if you come to the library even more than they love me.  well, i'm sure that's saying a lot.  how could i say no.  does that mean you'll do it.  yes, i'd be happy to come.  yay.  that's right.  next saturday at the library.  he says he'd be happy to come.  yay. all right.            .   you can't just go invite somebody.  we've got a musician.  it's francine's uncle.  well, it's too late.  yo mama says he's coming.  yoyo ma, dear.  see. she doesn't even know his name.  you don't know anything about music.  i know about real music, arthur read.  classical is better than any other kind.  but you wouldn't even know when to clap at a classical concert.  i would, toonever : because it's boring.  arthur, settle down.  i don't see why both of them can't come.  great.   yoyo ma can't just barge in anytime he wants and wreck everybody's day with a lot of boring cello music.  buster: you're right.  someone's got to stop that guy.  what's the matter with having them both.  sue ellen's right.  binky: if you really liked music one kind would be your favorite and you'd hate any other kind.  binky's right.  you have to pick a side.  everybody can't be right.  i'm good at having opinions i'm just not good at keeping them.  well, i can't wait for saturday.  this is going to be the best activity day ever.  why.  these two guys are going to get into the biggest fight you've ever seen.  a fight....  announcer: it's the musical bout of the century.  joshua redman is out there, and the crowd is going crazy.  they love him.   uhoh... here comes yoyo ma.    the ref goes over the rules...  and here they go.  what's this.  a cello.  ma is pulling the deadly dotzauer move.  this has been declared illegal in 40 states.  and, oh, this is the dirtiest fighting i've ever seen.  if someone doesn't stop him yoyo ma is going to bore joshua redman to death.   he's down for the count, folks, this looks bad.  and, oh. he's got the whistle.  he's got the whistle.  what's this.  a bicycle pump.  he's biting holes in the tube.  what can this be.   he's done it. he's done it.  i can't believe it.  joshua redman really can play anything.  what a victory for music.   maybe this won't be so bad.  i'll see you guys saturday.  this is my uncle, joshua redman.  he plays jazz, where the music isn't all written out so you have to make up music as you go along.  i guess somebody's too chicken to fight.  mr. ma will be here.  don't you worry, binky.  and so, here's my uncle.  thanks, francine.  and thank you all for inviting me down.  if you're anything like her you already know a lot about music.  arthur: mr. redman.  can you tell us what you think of classical music.  well, i'm not a classical musician but i sure like to listen to it.  and a lot of classical composers made up music as they played the same way francine was talking about jazz musicians doing.  only boring.  well... let's see.  tell me if you think this is boring, francine.    too bad it's not real music.   wonderful.  you came.  tell them that wasn't real music.  i thought it was pretty exciting.  what was wrong with it, d.w..  arthur was just banging the table.  that wasn't music.  he was.  hmm... arthur.  do that againbang the table like you did before.  what, like this.  that's it.  just keep it going.  you hear that beat.  all music begins with rhythm.   that doesn't sound very classical.  it's actually an old texas fiddle tune.  cool.  but some music's got to be better than other kinds.  ma: i don't know about better.  anyway, why do you like only one kind of music.  do you like just one kind of food.  yes, she does.  yes, i do.  but there have to be rules to tell what's good or bad, right.  the only rules are based on what people like to hear and those rules change all the time.  so you're not going to fight each other.  : not today.  oh.  want to play something together.  as a matter of fact, i've had a request.  i picked up the music.  i can't believe they like each other.  yoyo ma may be nice but he doesn't know much about music.   or maybe he isn't so bad.   goofy, spoony, high as a plane or a balloony...     sloppy, sloopy, gloppy, gloopy...   all:  hoola, hoopa, hoppyhoopy.    dopey, doffy, screwy, bluey    gooey, chewy, fooey, dewey...   wow, those guys are good.  they even make that sound like music.   crazy, crazy bus.    crazy, lazy, crazy, crazy bus.   binky: one more time.    and now: and now: i'm ilana, and i play the violin.   you hold it like this.  like that.   it's fun to play music...   because i have a nice teacher.   you just do it.    the saxophone.   about the saxophone.  hi, i'm max.   music is like its own language: it expresses feelings.   yeah.   i listened to the notes my teacher, mitch, played and i tried to play them back to him.    any kind of instrument can play any kind of music.       kids:and now...  hello, boys and girls.  i'm mary moo cow and it's time for fun.  can you spell "fun".   the best word i know is fun    fun spells fun    fun is nice, i like fun    i like fun    fun, fun    let's spell it again    fun, fun    fun spells...   arthur: hold it, stop the music.  stop the music.  what are you doing in my room.  singing about fun.   the best word i know is fun    fun spells fun...   argh. stop it.  stop the music.  are they done already.  did you let the cow in my room.  ..  maybe.   what are they doing here anyway.  this is when i get to talk.  i'm tired of you talking.  let's hear from someone new.  no way.  mary moo cowis a baby show.  i like it.  if i like it, maybe other kids do.  that's a baby show.  hey.   buster: he discovers he's been trapped by his archnemesis the doctorpus.  he's an octopus who went to college and became a doctor.  cool.  what's cool.  yesterday's episode ofthe dark bunny.  what's that.  both: you've never heard ofthe dark bunny..  no.  is it good.   it's only the best new show ever.  bionic bunny has a cousin who lives on the other side of the country...  francine: in a city where it's always nighttime and when there's trouble...   he launches himself down his bunny action tube and he becomes...  francine and buster: dark bunny.     then what happens.  watch it and find out.  i will.  i'm going to watch it today.  hi, honey.  hi, mom.  you're not going to bother d.w. while she's watching mary moo cow,are e no, mom.   what are you doing.  nothingjust waiting.  for what.  for your show to end.  then i'm watching the dark bunny.  no, you're not.  yes, i am.  no, because i saw it yesterday and it scared me and mom doesn't want me being scared.   arthur: mom.  in the kitchen.  arthur: mom.  in the kitchen.  arthur: mom.  i said i'm in...  d.w. said you said i can't watchdark bunny because you said you didn't want her being scared and she said it scares her.  mom said i'm watching the dark bunny after your baby show ends.  mary moo cowis not a baby show.  it is, tooit's always the same: three always comes after two blue and yellow always make green blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  oh, like "bubonic bunny" isn't always the same.  it's bionic bunny.  there's trouble, and no one calls bubonic bunny.  things get worse.  they call bubonic bunny.  he fixes it.  big whoop.  d.w.: mom, mom, mom, mom.  in the kitchen.  mom, mom, mom.  d.w., i'm in the...  how come i have to watchthe dark bunny which bothers me just because arthur wants to watch it.  isn't there something else you could do while he watches the show.  goodbye.  while you watch your weirdo show, i'm going to color.  and mary is not a baby

love ducks.  it's a fine day.    get away.  oh, no.  oh, brother.  goodbye, love ducks.  goodbye.  okay, d.w., you can come in now.   the coolest part was when dark bunny spun around wrapping himself in his cape.  no, it was when the giant claw grabbed for him.  which was cooler, arthur.  well...  did d.w. make you miss it again.  no...  which was coolercape, right.  claw.  um... i don't think i could choose between them.  today i'm definitely going to watchthe dark bunny.  goodbye, love ducks.  goodbye.  ah.  announcer: the dark bunny was brought to you bythe dark bunnytoy company.  why do
