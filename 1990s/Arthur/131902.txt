 ge: with chocolate syrup.  heavy on the sprinkles.  actually, better make it two scoops.  bad day, george.  i got a c on that geography test, i got a rip in my favorite jeans, and my head got stuck in my locker again.  well, at least it can't get any worse.  i take it back.  mrs. macgrady: hi, allen.  a strawberry swirl for me, and a cone of fudge fantasy for my friend, koko.  wait a minute... you're koko taylor.  taylor: the one and only, honey.  i have every one of your albums.  my favorite isforce of nature, but nothing beats "wang dang doodle" onthe earthshaker.  why, thank you.  it's always a pleasure to meet a blues fan.  you should come over on sunday.  we're having a potluck, and afterwards we'll have a jam session.  you're invited, too.  and bring a couple of pints of this fudge fantasy, too.  who was that.  koko taylor.  she's one of the best blues singers in the world.  you've never heard her.  not really.  mom.  i've got to go home.  i'm with george, and he's never heard koko.  this is going to cheer you up a lot more than ice cream.  come on.  taylor:  there may be snow on the mountain    but there's fire under the hill...   i've never heard a voice like that.  brain: i know.  it's sort of like a mixture of bessie smith and muddy waters.  muddy who.  you haven't heard of muddy waters either.  you don't know what you're missing.  you have to take some cds home with you.  my dad introduced me to the blues when i was five, and i've loved them ever since.  i've even written a few songs.    3.141that's the number we call pi    oh, 3.141, you know i'm talkin' 'bout that pi.    it's used to find circumference    that's a truth you can't deny.   you wrote a song about math.  blues doesn't have to be about getting your heart broken or losing your job.  you mean, a kid could write a song about...  oh... hanging out with a wooden dummy.  so long as he sang it with honest, heartfelt emotion.  that's what the blues is all about.   uh, hi, mrs. macgrady.  i brought lutefisk.  why, thank you, george.  come on in.  binky: hey, george...  what's with the tie.  i thought i'd get dressed up, because i'm performing.  you're not going to play that harmonica.  i was going to.  why. were you planning on playing harmonica, too.  no way, i'm not playing anything.  neither am i.  why would i want to embarrass myself in front of one of the greatest singers alive.  just don't sing.  i've heard you sing, and it sounds like nemo when i give him a bath.   let's put the pot on    put the pot on    we got the pot on    we got the pot on...    thank you.  thank you kindly.  well, who's next.  how about you, with the big beautiful horns.  come on, you brought your harp.  let's put it to work.   george: my lips are dry.  i need water, water.  everyone's waiting.  i've got to do something.   this is a song i wrote called, "the pinnochio blues."  :  i once had a good friend    and his head was made of wood.     yeah, i once had a good friend    and his head was made of wood    but he listened to my problems...   what's he saying.  he sounds like a mouse.  mrs. macgrady we can't hear you.  taylor: wait up a sec.  we all get nervous sometimes.  i've been singing for over 50 years, and i still get butterflies.  why don't you stay and have some ice cream.  : no, thank you.  well, okay.  but you come back and play for me anytime, big horns.  i mean that.  come on, it couldn't have been that bad.  no one could hear me.  and even if they could have, it still would have been terrible.  i can't sing, wally.  that's not true, george.  you have a beautiful voice, especially when it's coming through me.  no one else seems to think so.  i'm going to return the cds brain lent me.  "taj mahal"i never got to listen to this one.  put it on.  what's the rush.  you got a train to catch.   "tuning fork, mississippi. population: 10." not a very popular place, is it.  let's see if we can get something to drink.  i'm parched.  hello, boys.  sure is hot out there.  can i interest y'all in some lemonade.  i'd prefer furniture polish, but if that's all you got...   that'll be five dollars please.  i don't have five dollars.  how about a watch instead.  if you can't pay, i'm going to have to call the sheriff.  sheriff.  all right, you two, you're coming with me.  i'm the sheriff, too.  wait. wait.  isn't there some way we can pay you back.  can you sing.  um, well, i did just write a song, but...  okay.  oh...  you can try to make back what you owe me.  i'll give you till sundown.  then it's the hoosegow for you.  wally: "the hoosegow"..  not the hoosegow.  what's a hoosegow, george.  i don't know, but it doesn't sound good.  we'd better start singing.  you sing. i'll do drums.   i once had a good friend    and his head was made of wood    oh, i once had a...   : i do declare, that moose sounds just like a mouse.   ...was made of wood.   that's it.  no second verse.  why bother.  you heard her.  i sound like a mouse.  so.  a mouse has feelings, doesn't he.  put some feeling into it.  :  but he listened to my problems    just like a good friend should.   there you go.  you're singing it like you mean it.  you know what.  you got talent.  don't be afraid to show it.   taj mahal:  fancy goin' fishin' all of the time...   what about me.  don't i have talent.  taj mahal:  bet your life, your sweet wife    will catch more fish than you    many fish bites if you got good bait    here's a little tip that i would...      binky: heads up.  sorry.  whoa, nice guitar.  can i see.  careful.   it's out of tune.  no, it's just your hand position.  put your fingers on the right frets to make a chord.   hey, that's not bad.  you know some other ones.    wally: as your dummy, it's my duty to advise you not to do this.  why.  koko said i should come over and play for her.  i think i'm ready.  at least take me with you.  i'll warm her up with a couple of knockknock jokes.  sorry, wally, i have to do this alone.  don't think i don't know what's going on here.  things haven't been the same between us since you made that guitar.  i'm musical, too.  i can even sing while you drink a glass of water.  can your guitar do that..  hi, mrs. macgrady.  is ms. taylor around.  she is, but that's "koko" to you.  come on in.  i was just waiting for a friend to stop by.  looks like i got two for the price of one.  i wrote a new song.  it's really rough, but, well, here goes.   i'm sorry, my hands are a little sweaty.  relax, honey.  it's just koko, not mr. ratburn.   i'll be right back.  :  sometimes i feel so blue    i just don't know what to say   :  yeah, sometimes    i feel so blue    i just don't know what to say   :  but with this here guitar    i'm gonna play my blues away.    forget it.  taj mahal: is that it.  no second verse.  you... you're...  taj mahal.  pleased to meet you.  taylor: this is george.  he came over to play me a song he was working on.  don't stop on my account.  i liked what i was hearing.  but... my string broke.  i can fix that.  i always carry a few extra strings with me.  but in the meantime, maybe i can accompany you.  i believe you were doing 12bar blues with a fourfour beat, right.    i have these big antlers    it makes it hard to find a hat.        yes, you've got some mighty antlers    it must be hard to find a hat.   you could borrow mine sometime.   but my head is never cold    the blues takes care of that.       uh, i forgot the next verse.  so make one up.   oh, i just forgot the next verse    so i'll sing this one instead.   taylor: that's right, big horns.   yeah, we just forgot the next verse...     so we're singing this one instead.   taylor: sing those blues.   and i'll keep singing the blues    until i have to go to bed.   and now...   the blues.  it's music.  boy: paul and annie came to our school, and they played the blues for us.  paul plays the guitar.  annie played this... instrument, and it was called, um...   a harmonica.   well, first you take the harmonica and hold it in front of you.  then you blow into it.   we made our own song.  teacher: what about the second verse.  we can tell them the names of the birds we learned.  annie and class:  we learned about gulls...     blue jays, hummingbirds, and crows.     we learned about gulls...    blue jays, hummingbirds and crows.   this one's tough.  all:  ostriches, ravens    chickadees and orioles.    music is sort of like magic.   kids: and now...  hi, everybody.  i'm here on the set ofthe altosyou know, that tv show about the family life of a gangster.  they've agreed to let me teach you a little something about television.  here is what's known as...   the bleep.  whenever you hear...   it means there's something you're not supposed to hear.  here is the person who is making the...   watch and listen how it's used.   ugh.  terrible apple betty.  it's .  my mother, now, there was a woman who could make  amazing apple betty.  when she made it, the whole  neighborhood stood outside our house.  a  saint  that woman was.  if it's okay with you, t, i'd like to give that pastry chef a taste of his own cannoli.  hey, none of you...   so much as  unless i  say so.  capisce.  arthur: cut.  and there you have it.  of course, the bleep doesn't exist in real life, only in television.  but wouldn't it be great if it did.  then you could bleep out whatever you wanted.  francine: i can't believe it.  that was the easiest catch ever.  that's it.  you're never playing on this team ever, ever again.  in fact, you're never going to play on...   teams ever again.  , arthur .   d.w.: mom.  arthur just  your favorite  bird.  best of all, the bleep could be used when your mom and dad are going to visit your school and... .  huh.  hey, what's going on.  stop it.  stop.   what. oh.    oh...  grandma thora: well, this will make a very nice present for ethel, don't you think.  just wait here, sweetheart, while i go pay for it.     stop that.  you'll break something.  whatever.  that's enough, young man.  forget about going to that concert tonight.  young man: you can't do that.  i can, and i have.    grandma thora: come on, d.w., i'm done.  is something wrong, dear.  that boy just said this word that made his mom drop something.  really.  that's strange.  i know.  i never heard it before.  do you know what it means.  i don't know.  what did he say.  well, she said he couldn't go to a concert, and then he said...  what, dear.   oh.   never mind.  arthur, i have to ask you something.  what does  mean.   d.w.: wow.  it happened again.  you better not let mom and dad hear you say that.  why. what does it...  arthur, have you put away your...  what's going on in here.  nothing. nothing.  okay.  so, you ready.    shh.  don't worry, it's imaginary.  okay, since you know, tell me what it means.  i don't know.  i just figured you drop something when you hear it.  this is awful.  how will i ever find out.  just ask your mom and dad.  i told you, arthur said never say it to them.  well, if you can't ask them, who can you ask.  mom: nadine's right, honey.  all you have to do is tell it to us.  but what if it does something really, really bad.  what could one little word do.  okay.             bad idea, nadine.  : it makes people break things.    tommy: oh, no.  my danger ranger belt buckle just exploded.  my eyes. my eyes.   guess she doesn't watch cable tv.  wow.  so i can just say it.  just like that.   no, don't.  but you just said...  it's different when there's grownups around.   that's what arthur said.  why.  should we tell her.  timmy: no, i'm not sure... no, maybe.  tommy: okay, we'll give it a shot.  because it's a swear word.  what does that mean.  it means moms and dads hate it.  why.  wouldyouwant to turn into a zombie slave for a day.  a what.   yes, master.  your every wish is my command.  no.  just try it and see.  i did see.  the boy's mom dropped a glass.  then what.  i don't know.  grandma took me out of the store.  mmhmm. mmhmm.   children:  if you're happy and you know it, clap your hands.    if you're happy and you know it clap your hands.    if you're happy and you know it    and you really want to show it    if you're happy and you know it, clap your hands.    if you're happy and you know it, and you really...     yes, d.w., your every wish is my command.   um, can i have a soda.  wow.  uh... how about letting us watch tv.  any other wishes.  mrs. morgan: d.w., are you all right.  huh.  i'm fine.  scaredycat.  am not.  guess she just wants to stay a baby all her life.  yeah, she doesn't deserve to know the word.  oh...  anything wrong, honey.  mom...  yes, sweetie.  um...  yes, what is it, d.w..  uh, never mind.  did you say it yet.  shh.  what if the tibbles are lying.  wouldn't be the first time.  but then, what if they're not.  i mean, what if every kid says it.  maybe that's how arthur made mom and dad always treat him better than me.  that's a very good point.  if only i could test it.  cool.  and they do whatever you say.  uhhuh.  but you probably shouldn't say itever.  it's reallyonly for us older kids.  right.  d.w.: okay, by my calculations, she'll be saying it in the next five minutes.  d.w.: make that ten seconds.  mom: okay, d.w., time for dinner.  d.w.: i can't see.  mom: d.w., did you hear me.  d.w.: oh. there she is.  did she say it.  i don't know.  her brother got in the way.  mom: now, d.w..  just a minute.  mom: no, not just a minute.  your dinner is getting cold.  d.w. oh, wait, wait, wait.  .   .  i think she just said it.  mom: d.w., are you listening to me.   uhoh.    mom: dora winifred read...  whatdid you just say to me.  um, can i have a soda.  tibbles.  what are you doing.   i'll get it.  um...  uh... arthur did it.  well, you're off the hook this time, because you didn't know what you were saying, but i hope you know now that swear words are not appropriate things to say, especially for children.  why.  because most people are offended by them.  it's as simple as that.  but why.  what do they mean.  i guess you could say they mean "i want to hurt your feelings." good night, d.w.  why didn't somebody just tell me that in the first place.  wait till the kids at school hear about this.  you're a .  no, you are.  you look like a .  tommy: you're a .  well, did you say it to them.  what in  did they do when you did.  thanks for teaching it to us,
