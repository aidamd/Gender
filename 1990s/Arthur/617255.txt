 y working together .  . it's a simple message and it comes from the heart .  . believe in yourself .  . for that's the place to start .  . and i say hey. .  hey.  . what a wonderful kind of day .  . if we could learn to work and play .  . and get along with each other. .  hey.  . what a wonderful kind of day .  . hey. what a wonderful kind of day. .  hey.  arthur: hey, d.w.  hey.  whoa.   muffy : whoa, is this where you live, mod polly.  yeah, i just had it renovated.  isn't groovy.  i'll say.  want to dance.  sure.   i wish i had a place as nice as this.  i sleep in that trailer.  ew, it's so cheaplooking.  cheer up, paradise polly, i'm sure muffy will make you your own house some day.  a beautiful little beach house with real sand and a pool.   time to go.  i don't want to be late for the art opening.  do i have to go, daddy.  those things are so boring.  : come on, muffin, a little high culture never hurt anyone.  besides, art can be a great investment.  so are diamonds.  can we go to the jewelry store instead.   don't worry, paradise polly.  when i come back, i'm making you that beach house.   ed: you see, muffums, arthur ganson makes kinetic sculptures.  they're works of art that actually move and do things.  i think they're ingenious.  daddy, it's a chair.  just wait.   all: ooh...  see. how'd you like that.  um, yeah, that was great, i guess.  ed: i wonder what it's going to do.  my feet hurt.  how much longer do we have to stay here.  did you see that.  that little machine just flipped the chair.  oh... did it.  oh, lookcheese.  what, no brie.  hey, muffy.  aren't these sculptures great.  oh, please.  all i've seen are a couple of chairs.  big deal.  whoo.  i love this color.  have you seen "machine with oil".  is it like salad with oil.  i saw that at lunch.  come on.  it's really cool.  this blue is like the ocean or a tropical sky.   muffy, where's my beach house.  i want my beach house.    my dress.  isn't it funny.  it's like the machine is taking a bath.  it isn't funny, it's dumb...  and messy.  i guess some people just can't appreciate great art.  "great art".  this isn't great art.  it's just junk.  believe me, prunella, i would know great art if i saw it.  i have impeccable taste.  guess what, pumpkin.  i've decided to buy this one from mr. ganson here.  it's called "machine with wishbone." excellent choice, ed.  it brings to mind the tragicomic works of samuel becketta tiny figure forever yoked to its burden of absurdity.  yeah, and it's funny.  glad you like it, ed.  i'll be over monday to install it.  prunella: i wish "machine with wishbone" was going to be in my house.  some people have all the luck.  hai could make something more beautiful than that with my eyes closed.  oh, really.  i'd like to see that.  well, you will.  one for you, one for you and one for you.  you're all invited to my art show on monday.  "if you liked ganson, you'll love crosswire." muffy, i didn't know you made kinetic sculptures.  how long have you been working on this.  the invitations were the hard part.  i made them last night.  i'll do the sculptures this weekend.    okay, first i think we should arrange everything by color.  miss muffy, if your intention is to make kinetic sculptures, might i suggest that you think about what you want your sculptures to do.  oh.  i guess you're right.  there, my first piece.  i'll call it "rolling can." it has a childlike whimsy, miss muffyvery nice.  yeah, but all the sculptures at the art opening did something.  this just rolls.  perhaps it would be more impressive if it rolled down a ramp and set off a chain reaction.  hey, that's a great idea.  ready, miss muffy.  ready.   it workedit actually worked.  no, it didn't.  it ruined my new overalls.  just like that messy oil machine at the exhibit.  hmm...  you mean, it's a little too much like ganson's work.  you're right.  we need to come up with something all our own.  i need a change of clothes.  bailey, would you mind if i took a little break.  there's something i have to do.  by all means, miss muffy.  i will attend to... this.  okay, paradise, let's get to work.  now, my concept is this...  muffy: wrong.   oh, sweetums, i invited arthur ganson to your art show tomorrow.  i hope you don't mind.  it's tomorrow..  that's what it says on the invitation.  oh, noi completely forgot.  bailey. bailey.  uh... yes.  we have to get to work.  my art show is tomorrow and all i've made is "rolling can." no need to worry, miss muffy.  i made a few pieces to supplement your sculpture.  you did all this.  um, yes.  they don't move, so technically, they are not kinetic.  but they are interactive.  pleased to meet you.    what's this one called.  bailey: "chester." it's named after a boy who used to tease me in fourth grade.   ooh... he's kind of scary.   so was the real chester.  bailey, i never knew you were so... talented.  so, you like them.  i'm not sure if "like" is the right word.  they are very interesting.  but we have some important decisions to make, like what to serve.  cheese is so overdone.  i was thinking of littleempanadas.   muffy, how on earth did you make this.  it wasn't so hard.  bailey actually put it all together.  but itwasyour idea.  you're not just taking credit for someone else's work, like you did with the cookie contest.  uh...  the hors d'oeuvres are ready.  francine, you must try one of these.  see. it's not just a stuffed mushroom cap, it's a stuffed mushroom beret.  pretty cute, huh.   i don't like this one.  it's too sinister.  philistine.   this one is called "chester." it's named after a boy who used to tease me in the fourth grade.  you haven't been in the fourth grade yet.  oh. um...  actually, it was meant to be called "binky." that's a typo.  muffy, i owe you an apology.  these sculptures are amazing.  you're much more creative than i thought.  francine: oh, she's creative all righta creative liar.  she's just being a credithog again.  what.  come on, admit it.  bailey made them all, didn't he.  no, he didn't.  i made... one.  where is it.  over there.  it's called "rolling can," and it's kinetic.   nice try, muffy.  well, that was a failure.  indeed, miss muffy.  not for you, bailey.  i think a lot of people really liked your sculptures.  only the kids.  if i had just had more time...   whoa, this is powerful.  bailey: you really think so.  i do.  to me, it evokes the danger and humor present in everyday objects.  am happy you like my art.  exactly.  thank you, mr. ganson, thank you.  sorry i couldn't be here earlier.  i was installing "machine with wishbone" in your father's den.  that's a pretty wild piece.  oh, that's not part of the exhibit.  those are just my dollhouses.  this one's more of a doll environment than a dollhouse.  yeah, a house just wasn't right for paradise polly.  here, it's better with the fan.  nice.  you know, i'm curating an art show next week all about dolls.  i'd love to put this in the exhibit.  what.  but this isn't art.  sure it is.  you obviously put your heart and soul into it.  it's an expression of you.  i think it's beautiful.  i never thought of it like that.  i don't know if i want to put it in a show, though.  it's not really finished yet.  i understand.  but... i would like to take another look at "machine with wishbone." i don't think i got the full effect the first time i saw it.  groovy beach, paradise polly.  i wish muffy would make me an "environment." oh, she will, mod polly.  i'm sure of it.  kids: and now a word from us kids.  hi, my name is isaac.  today we came to the mit museum to see arthur ganson's sculptures.  ganson: have you seen something like it before.  student: on a bicycle. yes.  isaac: arthur ganson is a man who likes to make machines that move.  arthur ganson is a...  what was he again.  he likes to recycle things and use them to make machines.  and the thing about this is that it will never exist in the same shape twice.  on the top, it's like a big, like, um...  a clump.  and then it goes, like, round.  it's a wishbone.  ganson: what's going on here.  i guess that's supposed to be pulling it.  isaac: it's like a wishbone pulling this thing that moves by itself, which helps function the wishbone and move it.  ganson: will it fall off.  all: no.  what's going to happen.  student: it's going to stop...  students: cool.  ganson: and it'll go back and forth as long as you're willing to stand here and watch it.  this can be a little bit messy.  okay, now here we go.  student: ooh....  that's the best part.  student: the machine pours oil on itself.  ganson: just imagine if you were a machine.  what would you love to bathe yourself in.  oil, because it would oil your pieces.  how would it feel.  um, slippery.  why do you think i made this.  student: because you want to.  ganson: yeah.  he makes them because he likes the beauty of movement.  yes, he is an artist and an inventor.  and now, back toarthur.  d.w.: welcome tobaby cribzthe show that dares to take you where no one else will gobehind bars.   today we're visiting the crib of vicita molina in the heart of elwood city.  vicita: my crib is my own special place where no one but me can hang out.  check it out.  solid maple construction.  bars like that, you know you sleep safe.  and the jumpingsecond to none.  of course, no crib is complete without toys.  yessiree, with toys like this, you'll just flip.  i wouldn't give up my crib for the whole world.  oops, i broke the head off snowboard kristi.  sorry.  that's okay.  i have a secret agent kristi upstairs.  come on.   vicita, your new bed is here.  my crib.  where's my crib.  we talked about this, sweetheart.  you're old enough now to sleep in a biggirl bed.  mr. molina: alberto, let's get the mattress from the car.  vicita: my poor crib.  this is all that's left.  vicita...  : i want my crib.  d.w.: vicitaeverything's going to be okay.  how would you know.  because i've been through this before.  i was just like you.  i couldn't dream of sleeping anywhere but my crib.  d.w.: this is the life.  a big cozy crib, soft animals, a warm blanket.  long as a kid's got her crib, nothing in the world can go wrong.  look at you, d.w.  you're spilling out of that thing.  we need to get you a bed.  oh, no, mom.  i love this crib.  i love it more than anything in the whole world.  i want to sleep here my whole life.  d.w., remember how we talked about the new baby.  well, the baby's going to need a crib.  get one just like this.  any little brother or sister of mine deserves the best.  honey, the baby's going to sleep in your crib.  you mean the two of us will share this crib.  no, we'll give your crib to the baby, and you're going to sleep in a biggirl bed.  salesman: look at this, little girl.  this one has a secret pullout drawer for all your special little things.  so.  .  hey, how about this one.  it's got monkeys on the headboard.  i hate monkeys.  there must be something here you like.  no, there's not.  there's nothing in the whole store, because i don't want a bed.  i just want the same old crib i've always...  d.w.: whoa....  i want that one.  so i told my parents, "no more of this baby stuff.  i want my bed and i want it now." that was dumb.  yeah, i'd never sleep in a bed.  why not.  both: arachnar, lord of the spider people.  who.  he's half man, half spider and he eats children.  he can't reach his tentacles through the bars of a crib, but kids in beds are easy picking.  he climbs up the side and crawls under the sheets.  wait a sec.  if he's half man, half spider, why does he have tentacles.  uh, he's half octopus, too.  and half tyrannosaurus rex.  yikes, that sounds scary.  aw, vicita, they were just trying to scare me.  arachnar's just an irving legend.  a what.  an irving legend.  it's the kind of story your uncle irving tells.  it's really scary, but it never actually happened.  i don't have an uncle irving.  there is no uncle irving, vicita.  he's an irving legend, too.  now, let me finish my story.  oh, i love my new bed.  it's so much better than that silly old crib.  i'm glad you like it so much, sweetheart.  sleep tight.   d.w.: but i was just too excited about my bed to go to sleep.  this is the greatest bed in the whole universe.  then it hit me like a ton of blocks.  hey, no bars.  i can get right out of bed.  before i knew it, i'd gone through every book on the shelf.  and then i realized not onlydidn't i have to stay in my bed, i didn't even have to stay in my room.    : sure is nice how easily d.w. took to her new bed.  what a relief, huh.  d.w.: you said it.   i know sleeping in a bed is new, but mommy and daddy need their sleep, too.  so stay in bed, okay.  mmm.  okay.  mom: that's my girl.  i bet it's okay as long as i'm very, very quiet.  : hey, arthur.  wake up.   hey.  hi, stanley.  do you want to play.   would you like some tea, stanley.  : oh, no, thanks, i don't take sugar.  : here, let me warm up your cup.   huh.  arthur: robbers.  robbers. help. help.  arthur.  .   .  dad.  dad: no more getting out of bed, d.w., i mean it.  and no more playing with stanley.   you weresoscared.  i was not.  you took my stuff.  dad: that's enough, both of you.  now, we're all staying in bed, no exceptions.  vicita: weren't you scared, d.w., getting out of bed like that.  what if the robbers got you.  vicita, there were no robbers.  that was just arthur being a scaredycat.  well, what if uncle irving got you.  there is no uncle irving.  i bet that's because the robbers got him.   so anyway, the next night, everything started off normally. )
