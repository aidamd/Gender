 hey.  arthur: hey, d.w.  whoa.     arthur, quick, wake up.  it's time for school.   she does that about once a month, always on a saturday.   a brandnew day.  but what if it wasn't a new day.  what if every day of your life was exactly the same.  you could get stuck in a really bad day.  like that day we went to mary moo cow on ice.  dad, you said we could go to the new bionic bunny store.  but you told me we'd see "mary's icecowpades." well, we can't do both.  we'll have to flip a coin.  heads.  tails.  sorry, arthur.   yes.    arthur: and no matter what you did, the same thing kept happening, over and over again.  we'll have to flip a coin.  heads.  tails.  sorry, arthur.   yes.      boy, good thing that'll never happen.    aah, d.w..  remember, this friday is our sleepover field trip to the museum of science.  raise your hand if your parents have signed your permission form.  binky, if you don't bring in your permission form tomorrow, you won't be able to join us.  is that a promise.  what's the matter.  don't you want to go to the museum.  no.  i did this exact same field trip last year.  it was just one boring science exhibit after another.  binky: first there were the magnets.  all right, class, let go of your washers.  class: ooh.  see.  the magnet attracts the washer by pulling on the tiny atoms in the washer that act like magnets, too.  kids: wow.  binky: then came static electricity.    ow.  binky: then after more sciency stuff, we finally had dinner.   i hate macaroni and cheese.  binky: but the worst part was sleeping on that hard floor.   binky, something fun must have happened on the field trip.  well, there was one thing.   did they throw him in a pit full of snakes and spiders.  no. even when it was exciting, it was boring.  i hate repeating third grade.  buster: whoa, this is so cool.  was this exhibit here before.  that's the coatroom, doofus.  ratburn: all right...  binky and ratburn: let go of your washers.  class: ooh.  arthur: that's so neat.  girl: wow.     : ow.  ratburn: and it runs entirely on energy from the sun's rays.  okay, class, now we'll visit the chicken hatchery.    even this is exactly the same as last year.  stupid museum sleepovers.  hey.  this wasn't here last year.  "the world of tomorrow." wow.  mechanized voice: welcome home, binky.  bowwow.  hey, boy.  i got a ton of homework today.  homework is complete.  congratulations, you did very well.  bowwow.  thanks.  nachos, please.  extra cheddar, easy on the salsa.  4,792 channels and there's still nothing to watch.  robot dog: there is a live wrestling match on the planet shmekee: hydrozor versus multitasker.  bowwow.  there is.  i'm there.     go, multitasker.  put him in a headlock.  mr. ratburn, we got to go back.  we got to go see the world of tomorrow.  i'd like nothing better, binky.  but as you can see, it's not open today.  not open.  aw.  that really stinks.  oh, well, there's always next year.  oh, not again.  ..  ..  ..  ..  binky, you made me lose count again.  one, two...  do you read me, agent baxter.  loud and clear, agent read.  come on.  what's taking him so long.  lights out, everyone.  no talking.  sleep well.    hey.  the man said no talking.  now, everybody get to sleep.    aw, come on, do something.   uhoh.    this is even worse than the floor.  buster: whoa. i never knew there was anything in here.  binky: buster.  boy, am i glad to see you.  how long was i stuck in this thing.  hey, why are you wearing those weird pajamas.  pajamas.  this is my genetically altered skin.  and who is buster.  my name is thruster.  yeah, right.  and my name's engelbert humperdinck.  hi, engelbert.  are you part of the exhibit.  binky: "the world of yesterday." that's supposed to say "the world of tomorrow."  you're a funny exhibit, engelbert.  how can this be the world of tomorrow.  this landing craft is 200 years old.  it is.  then what's the date.  march 10, 2203, of course.  you mean i've been asleep for 200 years.  ah, no wonder i feel so refreshed.  i've got to find the others.  wait.  you can't leave if you're part of the exhibit.  i'm not part of the exhibit.  i'm a kid, like you.  what's a kid.  i'm an immature artificial lifeformialf, for short.  i'm here with my class.  see. we're on a field trip.  one night a year we stay at the museum and all get our batteries recharged together.  i snuck out to see the world of yesterday.  don't tell.   you're all robots.  oh no. you've woken up mr. rocketburn.  run.  why are we running.  if mr. rocketburn catches you, you'll be put back in the landing craft forever.  and i'll fail history.  robot: security.  we've got an escaped exhibit.  hey, a car.  we can get away in this.  where's the on switch.  it's a solarpowered car, engelbert.  it needs the sun's rays to work.  oh, right. i remember something like that.   i want to go home.  all: freeze, exhibit.  raise your fleshy appendages and step away from the car.  follow me.  i have an idea.  binky: what's this place.  the time travel exhibit.  you mean, this thing will take me to any time i want.  yep. all you have to do is answer a question about science.  all: this way.  hurry up.  mechanized voice: hello, and welcome to the time travel machine.  if you know the time you'd like to travel to, please say it now.  march 10, 200 years ago.  mechanized voice: you have selected march 10, 200 years agothe information age.  here is your science question.  what tiny particles attract a washer to a magnet.  oh, i know this one.  you have five seconds... four...  it's... it's...  rocketburn: it's time to go back to the exhibitforever.  no... no... no.  no. let me go.  binky, wake up.  wake up.  thruster, it's you.  where's mr. rocketburn.  who.  mr. ratburn, but he's a robot.  mr. ratburn is a robot.  i knew it.  wait a minute.  where's your robot suit.  i do have robot pajamas, but they're in the wash so i wore the cowboy ones.  binky: "world of tomorrow." hey, i made it back.  back.  from where.  from the future.  you were a robot named thruster, and i was going to be locked inside that landing craft forever because i didn't know how magnets worked.  never mind.  let's get back before mr. rocket...  i mean, ratburn catches us.  i was a robot.  did i do cool stuff.  did lasers come out of my eyes.  did i drink motor oil.   i hate to pull you away, binky, but everyone else is already on the bus.  just one more second.  the atoms in the washer are attracted to the magnet.  the atoms.  okay. all done.  do you feel you got more out of the field trip this year.  yeah, but i should come back a few more times.  this science stuff comes in handy when you're being chased by robots.  kids: and now...  i'm hunter, and this is my secondgrade class.  this is what we think the future will be like.  this house does housework for you.  it's a smart house.  it paints itself and it gets the newspaper for you and it waters the flowers for you.  this is the future.  there's a new neighborhood and easier ways to get around by hover cars.  they can hover.  these cars will not pollute, so people can breathe better.  this is a hospital of the future.  robots will be doctors, and they'll be able to tell exactly what's wrong with you right away.  stomachache.  and the ambulances will fly, so that you can get people to the hospital faster.  in the future, i think that the president's house will be so old that they'll have to rebuild it.  a sunandmoon symbol on the president's house will stand for peace.  hunter: in the future, instead of it raining raindrops, it rains money.  this way, everyone can get everything they need.  in the future, there'll be a new kind of merrygoround that makes you older and younger.  this merrygoround makes you one year younger every time around.  if you're old and you want to get younger, you'll live longer.  and this merrygoround makes you one year older every time around.  if a oneyearold wanted to drive a car like his big brother you could go on it and you'd grow a year older every time you went around.  this is the way it'll be in the future.  and now...   ow...    ooh, my throat.  arthur: mom.  where's my stripy shirt.  mom: your what.  my shirt with the green stripes.  the one i always play softball in.  uh, check the dryer.   it's not in the dryer.  mom: check the washer.  it's all wet.   what do i wear to the softball game.   sorry, arthur, i forgot to dry it.  hello.  pal.  hi, mrs. tibble.   mom: what.  oh, i completely forgot.  can i wear dad's parents' day shirt.  sure.  yeah.  tell d.w. i'll be there in five minutes.      then i hit the ball over the fence.  i've never done that.  your shirt's lucky.  dad: you wore my parents' day shirt.  i thoughtmyshirt was lucky.  you woremyshirt.  i hope you wash it.  arthur: your shirt is way lucky.  dad: it's a nice shirt. it's pima cotton.  timmy and tommy have paper bag puppet friends.  d.w.: you can color themthey're educational.  can i have one, please.   d.w.: can i, please.   please. please. please.  can't we just have a little peace and quiet for once..   oh. i'm sorry.  i don't know what's wrong.  i just haven't been feeling myself all day.   yep, you've got a fever.  congratulations, mrs. read, you've earned yourself a couple of days of bed rest.  i'm sure i'll be fine by the morning.  i know you're catering that tea tomorrow.  you just concentrate on getting better.  arthur: yeah, mom.  we'll take care of everything.    d.w.: i call this one baganini.  he sings.    lalala...   shh.  hey, look who's up.  how'd you sleep.  are you feeling better.  arthur: mom, want a maple doughnut.  d.w.: look what i made.  isn't it good.   no.  dad: don't worry.  as soon as i get back from catering, i'll clean this house.  kate, time to nap.  arthur, i'm worried about dad.  why.  he's not sick.  yeah, but he can't clean the whole house by himself.  it takes mom almost all day to clean the house, and look, it's already that time.  what if mom is sick for a couple of days.  the house will just get dirtier.  there'll be no clean dishes.  the dust bunnies will be hopping around everywhere.  we'll be living in a pig stew.  it's "pig sty," d.w.  but you're right.  he could use some help.  dad: i'm leaving.  i'll be back in a few hours.  stay out of trouble.  wait. mom always folds the laundry first.  i have something to confess to you.  i'm not sheldon.  you're not.  then who are you.  i'm shelby, sheldon's twin.  i should have told you sooner, karen.  woman: i'm not karen. i'm kara.  karen's my undercover name.  shelby: undercover.  kara: yes. i'm with the police.  i'm supposed to arrest you, but i can't.  i love you, sheldon.  shelby: i'm shelby, karen.  kara: kara. call me kara.  all done with the vacuuming.  how's the laundry going.  great.   stay.  hmph.     what's wrong with kate.  i don't know.  i was just making daddy's pajamas stay on the hook and she started crying.   arthur: uhoh.  d.w.: that's your job.  why is it my job.  you've seen mom change her just as much as i have.  but you're older.  so. you're closer to kate's age.  you probably remember how it's done.   okay, we'll shoot for it.  arthur and d.w.: rock, paper, scissors, shoot.  rock, paper, scissors...  rock, paper, scissors, shoot.  paper beats rock.  i win again.  come on, best of 35.  hey, d.w., look.  we can't change her now.  it'll wake her up.  arthur : okay.  doing all those chores wasn't so bad.  i don't why mom and dad are always complaining that they're so busy.  it only took us a few hours.  d.w.: i can't wait to see daddy's face when he sees all the work we did.  why was my shirt buried in the yard.  oh,that's where it was.  arthur's dog must have stolen it.  i couldn't find it when i put your clothes away.  youwere putting my clothes away.  uhhuh. we did all the housework for you.  d.w. did the laundry, i did the dishes...  dad: um...   is something burning.  oh, that's just the vacuum cleaner.  something happened to it when i vacuumed.  you have to pick up the big pieces by hand before you vacuum.    i'll fix it in the morning.    did you scrape the dishes and close the detergent door in the dishwasher.  um... i'm not sure.   arthur: we were going to change her, but she fell asleep.  that's okay.  it was nice of you two to try to help.   i don't feel so great.  think i'll change and hit the hay.  what about dinner.  there are sandwiches in the fridge.   i guess we didn't do as good a job as we thought.  you meanyoudidn't.  daddy didn't say anything about the laundry.  dad : who cut a hole in my pajamas.    i'm scared.  can i get in with you.  i don't want to wake mom and dad.  okay.  but not with the cow.  mary's scared, too.   d.w.: arthur, what if mom and dad aren't better by tomorrow.  you heard what mom said.  grandma thora is coming.  she'll help with the housework.  but what if they don't get better for a long time.  grandma can't come every day.  she's got bingo, and her aerobics class...  go to sleep, d.w.  hi, d.w., i'm home.  i'm at the computer.  how was the wedding.  arthur: i was fired again.  boy, the catering business is tough when you can make only peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.  hey, you think it's easy being an accountant when you can't count past ten.  are mom and dad feeling any better today.   does that answer your question.  oh, by the way, i sent kate to the orphanage.  what.  we just couldn't take care of her, arthur.  she deserves to be in a place that can change her diapers.  that's true.  besides, it's one less mouth to feed.  but i sure will miss her.  me, too.  : if only we had paid attention to all the work mom and dad do, maybe we could have run the house better.  : i know.  we're terrible parents.   i had the weirdest nightmare.  me, too.   kate. kate.  should we get mom and dad.  i don't know.  if they don't get enough sleep they might not get better, and then...  i'll get the clothespins.   this isn't so bad.   i'll clean the dishes.  no, no, no.   d.w.: i'll get the sponge mop.  arthur: i'll bring mom and dad breakfast, and then we'll...  why do you get to take it.  because it's too heavy for you.  no, it isn't.   let go. you let go.  grandma thora: why don't we all take it up to them.  but first, let's just see the state of affairs here.  your father said there was a load of dirty dishes.  yeah, because i forgot to scrape the plates and close the detergent door.  so, where are they.  we washed them this morning.  really.  okay, well, let's just give kate a fresh diaper.  we already did that, too.  they folded the laundry, they emptied the trash, and the house is spicandspan.  i don't see why you two felt you needed to call in the reserves.  arthur and d.w. run a very tight ship.  i guess we've trained them well.  yeah. we should get sick more often.  wow. it's not even noon and i'm already wiped out.  me, too.  running this house is hard work.  at least we only have to deal with two sick people and not...   oh, no.  hi, everyone, it's me, buster.  we always have something to dance about in elwood city, but you won't believe all the cool dances people are doing all around the country.  on my trip with my dad, i see people rock, stomp, twirl, pop and boogie to the beat.  i'm filming all the groovy fun and sending it back to my friends in elwood city on my very own video postcards.  they'repostcards from buster.  visit us
