 i said maybe.  but i have to do homework.  how can i do homework if she's staring at me like this.  can't you do something until arthur's ready to play.  but if i don't bother him, he'll never play with me.  i never said i'd play.  okay, i'll play with her.  i'll stop bothering him.  keep chopping.  i'm chopping, i'm chopping.    you've probably heard the expression "don't cry over spilled milk" but did you ever imagine it would lead to arthur and d.w. having to live alone and raise themselves and go to an orphanage.  my name is nadine.  i'm d.w.'s imaginary friend and i'll be your host for, "mom and dad have a great big fight."  ah, you're back.  bet you've been waiting to see this thing smash.  okay.  don't let the...  grab the...  milk thing... get...    but let's back things up just a little...    and see what my friend d.w. was doing as that thing smashed.  arthur: okay, i'll play with her.  i'll stop bothering him.  you have to wait till i'm done with my homework, you know.  i know it.  why do they have to be so fair all the time.  "let arthur finish his homework." "stop bothering arthur." i wish my parents were different.  duh...  mom, arthur said he'd play "confuse the goose" with me, but he won't.  : i said maybe.  oh, my poor d.w..  arthur, play with your perfect, lovely, adorable sister.  but i have to do homework.  what's more importanthomework or the happiness of a little girl.  is that a trick question.  : okay, i'll play with her.  stop that.  what'd i do.  you were looking at d.w. without smiling.  boy, wouldn't it be perfect.  if only i could change them.   i didn't do it.   how could you do that.  they'll be here any minute.  me.. you put it there.  i don't have time to argue about this.  who's arguing.  dad: i have to start the batter all over again.   arthur.  don't come in here.  mom. no. don't yell. stop.  you look scared.  if you saw something scary, tell dad.  i can't, arthur.  it's mom and dad who are scary.  they were yelling.  what. i don't believe you.  i heard it.  d.w.: nadine and i were going to play "confuse the goose"...  arthur: then why do you need me to play.  d.w.: because nadine and i always tie at everything.  stop interruptingso there we were and then there was this kersmash.   that's when i ran up here and...  wait a minute.  what did they say.  i didn't hear it exactly.  it's not important anyway.  what's important is they hate each other.  you're playing a trick and it won't work.  you do look scared.  i'm going to check this out.  right now.  here i go.  last chance to give up this joke.   i don't hear... ah.  don't do that.  i don't hear anything.  that's the end of the worry, right.  well...  oh, honey, just leave it.  i'll get it, please.  no, i've got it, i've got it.  it's my fault.  let me do it.   i told you.  this is all your fault.  how can it be my faulti was up here.  if you played with me, they wouldn't be mad.  it's your fault.  why.  because you're such a big pain.  you never practice the piano.  you slide your peas under the plate.  you... you wear glasses.  mom and dad are not fighting because i wear glasses.  maybe they are. are you them.  are you in their brains.  i don't think so, arthur read.   what if they never speak to each other again.  tell your father, "merry christmas." mother says "merry christmas," father.  tell your mother, "and a happy new year." every conversation will take twice as long.  we'll only get half as much done in our lives.  d.w., you're being silly.  two people wouldn't live together and never talk to each other.  : you're right.  one of them is going to move away.   both: good morning, mommy.  good morning.  it's so good to see your beautiful faces.  um, what's for breakfast.  i don't knowyour father always made breakfast.  so there's no breakfast.  : no.   dad leaving is totally unacceptable.  both: mmm. thank you, dad.  dig in.  you know what i always say: dig in.   dad, i need a ride to the park later for the big jamboree.  sorry, your mother took the car when she left.  oh... oh...  what if neither one of them wants to take all of us.  after all, you're a lot of trouble.  arthur: oh, i can't believe it.  d.w., did you break my truck. d.w..  arthur, did you forget that d.w. doesn't live here anymore.  she left with your dad.  oh, yeah, i forgot.  that's why it's so peaceful.  i'm going to take pal for a walk.  arthur, pal doesn't live here anymore either.  i got you and kate.  dad got d.w. and pal.    what if neither one of them wants us.  what if we have no parents anymore.  we'll be organs.  you mean "orphans" like inoliver twist.  : please, sir, may i 'ave some 'ore.  what.. you want some 'ore.  therethat's some oar, huh.  get it. some oar.   oh, i'm hysterical.  i should get paid by the laugh.  we have to avoid going to an orphanage at all costs especially one set in the 1800s.  all we have is each other.  if you take care of me i'll take care of you.  we don't need anyone else.   blech.   : we can't cook.  : . go to sleep, go to sleep .  . you've been awake for so long now .  . count all the sheep and subtract a cow .  . so you can go to sleep. .   arthur, this isn't working.  i miss mommy and daddy.  i know, i miss them, too.  i never knew you could feel this lonely even when you're not alone.  we can't let that happen.  it's all my fault.  i wished they were different and now they are.  let's tell them that we don't want them to hate each other.  we're a family.  our opinions count and stuff.  i don't hear anything.  dad: you stay, i'll go.  mom: no, i'll go.  i'm the one who should go.  i'm going and that's final.  daddy's leaving.  you're... choking... me.  d.w.: daddy.  daddy, don't go. please.  but i have to go.  no, you don't.  we don't want you to go.  if i don't, we won't have any milk.  but we... huh.  you're going to the store.  yes.  where did you think i was going.  don't leave us.  you and mommy don't really hate each other.  hold onwhat makes you think we hate each other.  we don't want to be organs likeoliver twits.  did you say you were going to the store.  she heard you fighting and thought you hated each other.  : kids are so funny, huh.  d.w., we don't hate each other.  sometimes adults lose their tempers and argue.  just like kids disagree sometimes or get mad.  you and arthur fight but it doesn't stop you from loving each other.  you're going to the store to buy milk.  yeah, and i have to hurry back because my friends are coming over.  guess i solved that one.  of course, the moral of our story is cleardon't put your milk close to the edge because somebody's going to knock it over.  thank you and goodbye for now.  kids: and now...  here in my class we made angry and happy masks.  this is my happy face...  and this is my mad face.  we made angry faces and happy faces.  this is my mad face.  this is my mad face.  and sometimes people get angry and happy.  this is my happy face.  this is my happy face.  angry is when you get really upset about something.  you get so annoyed when you get angry and frustrated.  this is my mad face.  i get angry when my dad takes me to the tennis club.  and this is my happy face.  people who love each other get mad at each other, too but they still love each other.  this is my mad face.  my sisters sometimes make me mad but i still love them.  this is my happy face.  this is my mad face.  this is my best friend.  her name is lena and i always get mad at her and that is very bad.  and this is my happy face.  this is what we look like when we're angry.  but i still like her and i play with her all the time.  not all the time.  most of the time.  and this is what we look like when we're happy.  when i'm angry, i go to sleep, and the next morning since there's a clear new day, then i feel much better not angry anymore.  kids: mad.  happy.  kids: and now...  it's not hard to make your own calendar.  you can draw your favorite cool things for every month.  this is a big year, so i drew big stuff.  januarybionic bunny moves a huge iceberg.  februarybionic bunny versus a giant valentine that wrecks buildings and makes everybody fall in love.  evil.  marchbionic bunny brings a mammoth birthday cake because d.w.'s birthday is on march first.  d.w. sure loves her birthday.  last year, she never stopped reminding us it was coming.  speaking of birthdays...  who's speaking of birthdays.  no one, but now that you mention it mine is coming up.  don't forget my birthday's coming.   this year will probably be worse.  hey, todayisd.w.'s birthday, but she hasn't said a word.  impossible.  d.w., did you forget that your birthday's today.  nohow could i forget about my own birthday.  now leave me alone.   how could d.w. not be excited about her birthday.  arthur.  shh.  i said leave me alone, please.  first tell me why you're not excited about your birthday.  you really want to know.  do you think you really want to know.  um... yeah.  oh, okay, just checking.  it all started when i told daddy what kind of birthday cake i wanted.  for my birthday, which is coming soon i want a normal cake.  you sure.  how about a big, purple...  normalwhite frosting on top, white cake inside.  no crunchy stuff, no gushy red layers, no lamb no surprises.  you sure you don't want to try my aloha coconut blizzard cake with peach and banana pectin filling.  daddy.  i'm joking.  normal.  got it.  d.w.: i can't wait for my birthday.  my daddy is making me a normal cake with...  you know, turning five is a very big step.  yeah. with white icing on top and...  d.w., i am five years old already.  listen to me.  when you're five, you cannot do the same things you did when you were only four.  what do you mean.  i mean, you have to leave childish things behind.  you will be going to real schoolkindergarten.  kindergarten.  you will never be a little kid ever again.  : ever again... again...  and now, here it is, my birthday.  they're going to give me normal cake and then, whammo, i'm five.  so.  so i don't know if i'm ready.  i'll never be four again, you know.  did i do everything i could.  did i waste my fours.  have i fribbled away my childhood.  no.  nothat's it.  a simple threeletter word like "no" doesn't exactly make me feel better, arthur.   oh, come on.  you did plenty of great stuff, d.w.  yeah. like what.  like you fooled the tooth fairy and got money.  d.w.: looklook what the tooth fairy left me.  : i tricked the tooth fairy.  i tricked the tooth fairy.  arthur: and besides that, you taught us all about fire drills.  no talking. remain calm.  faster, people, there's a fire in here.  what's it say.  three minutes, nine seconds.  not bad, but we must get it down to 58 seconds.   arthur: and you got to go to the hospital and get stitches.  mom: you were very brave, d.w.  it doesn't look so bad.  well, it feels bad.  these are the golden memories of my childhooda buck, a fire drill and a fat lip.  okay, i'm sure there was more.  um... yeah, remember when you learned to do flips on the balance beam.  d.w.: not exactly, arthur.  she's too scared to do it.  whoa.   she's going to chicken out.  whoa.  am not.     d.w.: i learned i was too young to do flips.  oh, well, i knowyou made a deer friend when we went camping.  hi.  d.w.: but i couldn't bring him home.  arthur: no, but mr. rogers came to our home.  . there are stops along the way .  . for thoughts of all the soft things...  .  d.w.: that song put me to sleep.  arthur: it was supposed to.  it's a lullaby.  d.w.: but i was asleep, so it's not one of my memories.  arthur: you weren't asleep when you met the president in the white house.  man: beautiful horse, huh.  yeahdo you work here.  i've worked here for a couple of years now.  then maybe you can help me.  my family got lost.  they're with another tour guide.  come on, follow me.  i can get you back where you came from.  are there more paintings with horses.  lotsi'll point them out.  d.w.: so i met some people.  how hard is that.  i didn't do anything.  arthur: sure you did.  you helped build a chicken coop at grandpa dave's house.  and went to "crazy bus live." and caught chicken pox from me.  d.w.: that wasn't fun.  arthur: but i bet you'll never forget it.  and you rescued cousin lucy's ring to save her wedding.  thank you, d.w.  we couldn't have done it without you.  arthur: and you took good care of kate when she was born.  everyone stand back.  i know what she wants.  d.w.: i just thought of something else i did.  i saved a snowball in the freezer and somebody took it.  it wasn't me.  can't you forget that and look at all the cool stuff you did.  it was a great year.  except for the snowball.  what's this for.  because you made me remember how great i am.  you're my little sister.  i want you to have a happy birthday.  i'm going to be the world's coolest fiveyearold.  make a good wish when you blow out the candles on your cake.  that's right, and i know the perfect thing to wish for.  you can't wish for a million more wishes.  it's against the rules.  oh, you're such a spoilsport.  well, i'm going to really make this wish count.  i'll get ideas from mommy and daddy.  mommy, i...  mom.  dad.  happy birthday.  make a wish and blow out your candles.  go ahead and blow them out, honey.  i don't know what to wish for, arthur.  what did you wish for last year.  d.w.: that's right before kate was born.  i remember making a wish and blowing out the candles.  but i can't remember the wish.  what if i wish for the same thing again.  i'll waste it.  hurry up, that cake looks delicious.  it has to be the perfect wish.  you don't get this kind of power every day.  it must be used wisely.  why don't you wish for a happy year.  mommy, there has to be something in it for me.  why don't you wish for new sneakers.  you don't wish for clothes, daddy.  clothes just happen.  wishes are for big things, like a pony.  i have to advise you not to waste your wish on a pony.  yeah, that's not a great idea.  it won't come true, trust me.  i won't eat cake with wax all over it.  hurry uplook, kate's starving.   think, think.  think, think.  d.w., you don't have to fret over your wish like this because on my birthday...  i wished that you and arthur have happiness and everything you need.  and a grandma's wishes for her grandchildren always come true.  so you mean, it's like i'm already covered wishwise.  uhhuh.  wow.  who else but grandma would give up her own birthday wish for us.  do we have to keep hugging so much here.  shh.  i know exactly what i'll wish for now.  arthur : finally.    : that's the best normal cake i ever had, daddy.  so what did you wish for, d.w..  it won't come true if i tell.  will you tell me after it does come true.  oh, you'll know.  dad: look out.   whatyou didn't think i would let that big old mushy cake hit me in the face, did you.  whoa.    boy, that was fast.  what was fast.  oh, nothing.   hey, was this what you wished for.  you're not supposed to tell a wish, remember.   even if it does come true.  hey, pal, cut it out.  kids: and now...  brown: the idea for pal came when we wanted to get a pet at our house, and i invented a pet that arthur could have.  i start with this oval shape, and then i give him eyes and a little triangle for his nose.  and pal's a pretty happy dog, so we'll make him smiling.  and we'll add his ears.  now we'll give him his collar, and he's off for an adventure.   visit us online at pbskidsgo.org.  you can findarthurbooks and lots of other books, too, at your local library.  oned by the caption center wgbh educational foundation] . what a
