 s of sinope, and i am looking for an honest man.  are you an honest man.  uh... i don't know.  i think so.  no, he isn't.  he took my snowball and he's been lying about it for years.  delta omega, once and for all, i did not take...  don't listen to him.  i know where you can find what you're looking for.       i am diogenes of sinope, and i am looking for an honest man.  any honest men in here.   why couldn't i have looked for the meaning of life instead.   timmy: ...and kevin was sucked up into the spaceship.  and the alien took his ice cream, and kevin knew that the alien wanted more ice cream...  but he didn't have ice cream.  he tried to give the alien gum, candy...  little pieces of cheese he had in his pocket...  but it was no good.  the alien took him away.  the was the end of him.  all that's left of kevin now is...   : this pencil.   hey, wait a minute.  if you never saw kevin again, how do you know all this.   a bird told me.  the aliens can turn into animals.  if you listen really closely, sometimes you can even understand what they're saying.    ar them.  they're saying...  "ice cream." ice cream... ice cream...  ice cream... ice cream...   here. tell them they can have it.   mmm, strawberry.  hey. how come you get the first bite.  because my stories were better.  were not.  were, too.   look, a bionic bunny doll.  i saw a commercial for it.  did you know it can fly.  watch this.  hey, vicita, how's your pony.  i don't have a pony.  you don't.  we got two ponies for christmas.  no, timmy, it was three.  remember.  mom sent one from, uh... las vegas.  oh, yeah, you're right, we do have three ponies.  i forget about thumper because we never have time to ride him and brush him and play with him.  i'll take him.  give thumper to me.  i promise i'll take good care of him.  please, please, please, please, please.  okay, just give us the doll.  oh, but that's alberto's.  i'm not supposed to be playing with it.  oh, well, guess we'll just have to give thumper to d.w.  wait.  twins: one, two, three.  fly.  uhoh.  timmy: we thought he could fly, like on the commercial.  yeah, it's the tv's fault.  the tv lied to us.  just like you lied to my little sister, promising her a pony.  so, how do you two propose to pay alberto back for the toy.  grandma: it cost $17.95.  you could have this cow.  it moos when you squeeze it.   and it doesn't break when you throw it.  i'm 13.  you think i want to play with a plastic cow.   if you promise not to lie again you don't have to pay me back right away.  cross our hearts.  you can count on us.  tommy: he said that timmy and i were the most smartest kids he'd ever met.  he really said that.  well, maybe he didn't usethosewords.  but we could tell that's what he meant.  okay, i think we have enough rocks.  what are we going to do with all these.  play rockball.  hit the rock as hard as you can.  here.  are you sure we're allowed to play this.  oh, yeah, grandma doesn't mind.  she just doesn't want us to play baseball.  but this game doesn't have any bases.  it's a whole different ball game.  batter up.  alberto: ow.    but it's not ourfault.  d.w. did it.  but who's idea was it to play baseball with rocks.  what a stupid game.  you could hurt someone.  i wasn't playing baseball.  were you, tommy.  nope. i'm not allowed to play baseball.  i don't even know how to play.  me neither.  alberto: telling the truth is more than just changing the words for things.  but i give up. i've tried.  you know, i wouldn't be surprised if you two ended up in jail someday.  wow.  we didn't get punished at all.  yeah.  and we didn't even lie.  kind of.  timmy: tommy, what's "jail".  it's where they put grownups who've been bad.  i saw it on tv.  you sit in a room with metal bars and you can't leave, not even to see your grandma, and sometimes you have to stay there for ten years.   ten years.  i had a timeout for ten minutes once, but ten years.   i can play that louder than you.  hey, it's still my turn.  let go. let go.  give it.  it's mine.  i had it first.    guard: hey, tibbles.  you got a visitor.  it's the two halftruths.  prisoner: liar, liar, pants on fire.  grandma tibble: hello, dears.  how have you been.  is the food okay.  no, it's terrible.  we haven't been able to eat a thing.  well, i brought you this cherry pie.  but what if you're lying again.  what if the food is actually quite good.  how do i know you're telling the truth.  we are, grandma.  we promise.  oh, i wish could believe you.    do you like cherry pie.  it's homemade.  no. no.  i don't want to go to jail.  me neither.  from now on, i'm telling the truth.  the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help me grandma.  tommy: ow.  ow.  ow.  ow.  both: cookies.  did you two boys eat all those samples.  we cannot tell a lie.  both: wedid it.  they were that good.  have some more.  i like telling the truth.  me, too.   hi, tommy and timmy.  let me guess, you want to borrow my mary moo cow tapes.  no, we just came by to tell you that you're too bossy.  and you sing "crazy bus" way too much.  it's annoying.  hi, mrs. read.  your house smells like dog.  tommy: you have a funny name.  you'll probably never get a pony.  they cost too much.   your head is too big.  you believe anything.  i do.  your nose is too small.  uhhuh.  okay.  sorry you feel that way.  bye.  emily says she never wants to see us again.  really.  that's just what d.w. said, and vicita.  who are we supposed to play with now.  i don't know.  uh, how about kevin.  no, he's not real.  we made him up, remember.  oh, yeah.  you know, tommy, maybe your idea about telling the truth all the time wasn't such a good one.  myidea.  it wasyouridea, timmy.  no, it wasn't.  yes, it was.  no, it wasn't.  yes, it was.  you make me so mad.  sometimes i wish i didn't have a twin.  and that's the truth.   wait.  hey, tommy and timmy.  what, no rockball today.  i wore my bike helmet for nothing.  don't worry, alberto, i'll never play rockball again.  in ft, i'll probably never play anything with anyone ever again.  why.  because everybody's mad at me for telling the truth.  timmy wishes he didn't even have a twin.  that was 'cause i was angry.  but it was the truth, right.  just because you two are being honest now you don't have to say everything that pops into your heads.  both: we don't.  of course not.  why don't you try telling the truth and being nice at the same time.  most of the time i really like having a twin.  in fact, you're my best friend in the whole world.  you're so nice.  yeah. and really, really generous.  like when you have candy, you always share.   i want to be just like you when i grow up.  really.  wow.  i'm a role model.  you want some gummy eels.   mmm. mmm.  i like being nice and honest at the same time.  timmy: me, too.  is that what grownups call "flattery".  i don't know what it's called, but it works like a charm.  kids:and now...  hi, my name's janessa and this is my secondgrade class.  today we're writing poems, we're writing in our journals, and drawing pictures about lying.  i lied to my little sister, jill.  i told jill that there was an angel in our closet because i wanted her to stop having nightmares.  it was kind of like a helping lie.  a helping lie.  janessa: i told a lie to natalie, to natalie i told it.  i told another to cover it up.  i lied, making it seem like it wasn't my fault.  before it spreads, i better fix it.  because once you tell a lie, people will start to think things that aren't true and then they'll tell other people and if you don't tell the truth soon then everyone will know it.  "can you stop lying to me.  "it hurts my feelings.  "friends don't lie.  they are nice to each other." girl: this is a poem about how i feel when somebody has lied to me.  "my stomach was tossing and turning like a tornado.  "my eyes were as leaky as a water faucet.  "it's very sad.  were you ever lied to." boy: one time at zach's grandmother's pool we told his little sister there was an invisible white shark so we could scare her.  we just wanted to swim in the pool ourselves.  so we lied.  "i'll never lie again, even if i'm talking to a hen."   kids:and now...  time is relative.  here in berlin it's 6:48 p.m. und20 seconds.  brain: my new chrono 3000 tells the time in 50 dierent countries.  in helsinki it's 7:49.  in matsuyama it's almost 3:00 in the morning.  that's japan.  in wellington...  an open shot.  i'm going to score.  in paraguay...    brain: arthur, tell binky i'm not talking to him until he apologizes.  me.  tell brain tillheapologizes for blowing my shot, never speaking is just fine.  oh, yeah.  arthur, tell binky...   sorry, got to go.  muffy's got ballet class.  either of you need a ride.  my mom's coming any moment now.  oh, yeah.  well,mymom's taking me to the movies.  so you're okay waiting.  i am, but maybe binky's not.  i can wait ten times longer than him.  gee, my mother's never late.  hey, brain, do you know what time it is.     how long did you say wee been waing.  : i don't know.  you broke my watch, remember.  and i thought we weren't talking to each other.  so how long do youthink we've been waiting.  i don't know.  alongtime.  aw, i knew it.  what if my mother never comes.  oh, my goodnessi'm late to pick up binky.  let's not pick him up.  it's so nice and quiet without him.  you're right.  we can watch what we want on tv for once.  and think of the savingsfood, clothes, sitters...  that was binky's favorite.  enjoy.  binky's mom: ah, this is the life.  no dinners to cook, no rooms to clean, and best of all, no...  what was our son's name again.  i forget.   they've forgotten me.  binky, be logical.  our mothers are probably just stuck in traffic.  on a sunday.  well, maybe something's causing the traffic.     come on, all that traffic from just one duck.  well, it could be a whole family of ducks.  but can't ducks fly.  hmm... that's true.  but ostriches can't.   brain: or maybe there was a rip in the timespace continuum.   according to einstein's theory of relativity, they would be traveling at speeds that make time move slower for them than for us here on earth.  einstein : time is relative.  brain: they could show up years from now without realizing how long it's been.   sorry we're a few minutes late.  a few minutes..  we've been waiting 70 years for you young whippersnappers.   you're really weird.  i'm just saying we need to examine all the possibilities.  maybe they'll feel bad about being so late.  in fact, this could be the best day of our lives.  what are you talking about.  we've been waitingong, our parents will feel really guilty.  and then we've got it made.  it's a great cake, but where are the presents.  well, sweetums, you've had 13 birthday parties this year alone.  we figured this time you'd be happy with just the cake.  do i need to remind you how long i waited in the cold, the howling wind.  yes, but...  or perhaps i could tell the local newspaper all about it.  oh, dear.  daddy's running to the toy store.  swing by the ice cream parlor, too.  e.  and the longer we wait...  the greater their guilt.  and here i thought you were held back because you weren't so smart.  nope, it was so i could pass on my wisdom to you youngsters.  well, our moms can take their sweet time.  you said it.  every extra minute of waiting is like money in the bank.  aw, except for one thing.  waiting's really boring without tv.  you don't need tv to pass the time.  a good book on 18thcentury land reform would do.  if you say so.  but we don't have that, either.  well, what did people do before television and books.  binky: watched clouds.  clouds.  of course.  that'll pass loads of time.  see, there's a cumulus.  and a cumulonimbus.  oh, and look, a stratocumulocirrus.  binky: you're doing it all wrong.  you're supposed to use your imagination.  okay then.  what does that one look like.  binky: wow, it looks just like...  brain: yeah, an amoeba.  an amoeba.  and we'll be saved.   that is if we don't die of hunger first.  i have carrots.  my mom packed them.  she works in an ice cream parlor and al are carrots.  would you prefer a turnip.   i just remembered.  my mom packed them, back when she loved me.  peanut butter crackers.  thanks, binky.  i'm sorry i made you miss that goal.  that's okay.  i'm sorry i broke your watch.  brain: to never fighting again.   e ythmthe stet    it's a simple message and it comes from the heart    believe in yourself    for that's the place to start    and i say hey.   hey.   what a wonderful kind of day    if we could learn to work and play    and get alongwith each other.   hey.   what a wonderful kind of day
