"our prices are so low, we must be quackers."  it still makes me laugh.  well, it should.  after all, you came up with it, muffin.  francine: this was your idea.  yep, and since i've been doing these commercials, business has tripled.  i told you, daddy: people love to laugh.  but of course you know all about that, francine.  re an internet celebrity.  actually, i was thinking we should take it down.  but you haven't even seen the comments people are leaving.  listen to this one: "my fish, finster, recently swam away "and this video really brightened my day.  "thank you, flippity.  "you should have your own show.  best, winnie from winnipeg." and there's hundreds of others.  we have to do more videos, francine.  i don't care how many hits it has.  i don't like having people laugh at me.  you're hysterical.  you're an internet celebrity.  you're a star.  whoa.   you're such a goof.  i can see why everyone loves your video.  thanks.    how do you make a smile a frown.    who's that girl who's the goof of the town.    she's gonna turn your world upside down.     it's flippity francine.   oh, daddy.  they're stealing 17% of our net worth.  who will save us.  ahh.  it's flippity francine.   she's not just a clown, she's the talk of the town    she's flippity francine, flippity francine.     hello.  did you take the video down yet.  no.   but i promise, i'll do it in the morning.  well... don't.  good night.  wants to try to solve this multiplication problem.  me, me, mr. ratburn.  whoa.  francine, did you hurt anything.  just...  my dignity.   it's just like the video.  go, flippity.  all: flippity, flippity, flippity.  oh, please.  you're all too generous.  whoa, whoa.   she's great.  i'll never get tired of this.  i'm tired of this.  me too.  15,000 page views worldwide can't be wrong.   okay team, gather 'round.  today we're facing mighty mountain.  we can climb that mountain, knock it over, and come down the other side if we play as a team.  now go out there and give it all you've got.   i'm open.  dw: don't flub it, flippity.  huh.  oof.   we could've won if you weren't such an attention hog.  i didn't do it on purpose.  i just got distracted and...  tell it to your 10,000 fans.  it's 15,000 fans.  and counting.  muffy, we've got to stop this.  why.  this may be your best fall yet.  you're fans are going to love it.  i don't care.  i don't want "fans" anymore.  i want this all to stop.  okay.  but it wasn't just me filming out there.  lots of people were.  flippity, you're hysterical.   narrator: francine frensky.  athlete, popular girl.  then, an accidental encounter with a soccer ball, a video camera and the internet would rip all of that away.  gentlemen, we can remake her...  sillier.  goofier.   totally ridiculous.  narrator: haunted by the memory of the life she once had, francine frensky now does flips for small children.  again.  "flippity frank." great, now i even have copycats.   hey, buster.  yes, i know, we could've won the game if it wasn't for me.  oh, i wasn't calling about that.  i had an idea.  have you thought about using a trampoline.  it could spice up your act.  no thanks.  i just want to be plain old francine again.  i'd give anything for that.  yeah, i know how you feel.  you do.  remember when i saved that cat from a tree.  i was a celebrity for... well, at least a week.  i hated it.  everyone thought i was really stuck up.  how'd you get people to like you again.  hmm, i don't remember.  hold on.  oh, i saved my friends from a runaway piano.  do you see any runaway pianos.  uh, no.  aw, too bad.  the only way i know of not being famous for one thing is to be famous for something else.  hopefully, something you're proud of.  buster, that's it.  you're a genius.  that's what i keep saying.  buster: francine, the game doesn't start for an hour.  how long have you been here.  i've been putting in some extra practice.  practicing your flips.  maybe you should just be the team mascot.  i'm open.    yes, we won.  you were right, francine.  that pinwheel kick would've been a great video for themuffington post.  i can't believe i didn't film it.  i can't believe the 5:00 news did.  my mom got the footage.  she tapes all our games.  can we watch it again.  okay, just one more time.  but we have to back it up to my favorite part.  wing it on over to crosswire motors.  our prices are so low, we must be quackers.  quack, quack.  and now...  my name's sierra, and this is my firstgrade class.  and we're taking some pictures.  all right, isabella, so you want to tilt it so you see his face.  sierra: the artist takes the picture and the subject sits in a chair.  boy: the artists were trying to make us smile.  sierra: then our teacher, mrs. white, printed out the pictures, and now we're decorating around it.  incoming feather.  i'll get the ocean pieces glued on.  it's really good.  muffy made a video of francine.  francine didn't like the video of her, so we are trying to do something that will make our subjects happy.  boy: i put the things that alexa likes.  i like ocean animals.  girl: that is a moose with a beard, because he loves mooses.  sierra: we're trying to make as much as the pictures can tell about the people on the picture.  this is a portrait of dylan, and it looks like he likes red and he likes kings.  the artists need to learn about subjects because we are putting them on the picture.  i'm guessing that's a bunny.  yeah.  i learned that he likes bunnies and that he likes hot dogs.  this is a portrait of benjamin.  i think he likes snakes.  my subject, he likes penguins so he's designing penguins however he likes.  a lot of penguins.  we worked as a team.  this is a picture of emily.  i was trying to do the things that emily likes.  do you like it.  and now...   aw, i missed again.  mom always says there's no shame in asking for help when you need it.  help.  you have to flap slower.  don't press so many times.  here, i'll show you.  i said "help," not take over.  is that cranky bees.  everyone plays it at the office.  here, let me show you how to pop the balloons.   what level is this.  i've never seen wasps before.  here, let me help you, dear.  these games can be very frustrating.  take that, you mangy drones.  oh yeah, perfect landing.  now it gets interesting...  but sometimes instead of helping you figure something out, people end up doing it for you.  that's right, mr. zeppelin.  this game is for the birds.  let's go outside.   mr. ratburn: tell me this, class.  when is a block of wood an experiment in engineering.  ooh, ooh.  when a mad scientist makes a flying robot out of it.  no.  i'm referring to the first annual lakewood derby.  each of you will shape a block of wood into a race car of your own design.  class: whoa, awesome.  your parents will need to help you with the tools, but most of the work should be your own.  then we'll race the cars to see which has the best aerodynamic design.  i can see it now: buster baxter, fastest car on the track.  no way.  you're going to be eating my dust.  sorry, but you're all going to lose.  my dad owns crosswire motors.  cars are in my blood.  daddy, could you help me with my homework.  sure.  but if it's math, english, history or science, you might want to ask your mother.  i think it's something you know a thing or two about.  we get to design our very own cars.  and then we get to race them in a derby.  i remember doing a project just like this when i was your age.   the kitchen table took a few lumps, but i won the blue ribbon.  after that, it was nothing but cars for me.  so, you'll help me with the project.  you bet i will.   okay, here's my idea.  i call it the "crossvette." i gave it a pointy shape because i thought that would make it go faster.  oh, and it also has velvet massaging seats, a sunroof and eight vanilla latte cupholders.  not bad at all.  but maybe we should get some more ideas in the hopper before we settle on a design.  these, my dear, are some of the finest cars ever made.  this is 1949 royceley mark vi.  and this one is the '61 exton benton.  talk about style.  wow...  but i think this might be the perfect car for you.  the '73 muscle car.  powerful, confidentit's got "derby winner" written all over it.  well, if you think it'll win...  okay.  i like it.  but it might be hard to draw.  could you help me.  with pleasure.  let's see, we'll need some graph paper, technical pens, a ruler, a compass, a protractor, tsquares, setsquares...  i knew buster would come up with something crazy.  ooh, i like it.  but can you actually build that.  we have to build these.  aw.  let's see yours, muffy.  whoa.  cool.  it's called the crossvette.  how did you draw this.  with a pen.  and ink.  okay, my dad might've helped me a little.  but it's still my idea.  and it's still going to win.  see, you shape the wood like that.  now you have a go, sweetheart.  just be careful.  you want it rounded, no sharp angles.  oh, not quite so deep in the center...  watch that corner...  am i doing it all wrong.  no, no, it just takes a little practice.  here, let me show you again.  there are 16 more grades of sandpaper after this.  this baby's gonna be smooth as silk.   my hand's getting tired.  i'll take over.  what should i do.  why don't you watch my technique for a bit.  you can give me a break later.  you know, this is the exact same technique you'll use when you apply a highend polymer buff coating to your first real car.  all done.  oh, okay.  so what's next.  if we want this car to win, the weight has to be just right.  see, now it's too light.  now it's too heavy.  now it's too light.  would it be okay if i went to check my email.  sure thing.  too heavy...  too light...  heavy...  too light...  francine: check it out.  i like it.  it's so you.  it's not finished yet.  how's the crossvette coming.  great.  we're almost done.  not that i've done very much.  aha, i knew it.  you're getting your dad to do the whole project for you.  i could tell by the drawing.  that's not true.  he's just...  actually, it is true.  but i don't want him to do it for me.  i want it to be my car.  so. just tell him.  it's your assignment.  you're right.  i will.  thank you, francine.  oh, by the way, that flat windshield will produce drag and slow you down.  you'll never win.  muffy: i'll just say, "daddy, you've done a great job on this project, but we have to let oh, no, too harsh...  muffin, come here.  you gotta see this.   i built this course to see what sort of times you were getting.  this baby's getting faster and faster.  watch.  half a second off.  whoohoo.  you're...  you don't want my help anymore.  it's just that mr. ratburn said we have to do most of the work ourselves, and i kinda want to.  : okay, i understand.  hi, i'm interested in buying a car.   here.  just take any one you want.  take 'em all.  i'm not interested in selling cars anymore.  i'm not even interested in driving them.   hey kid, wanna trade.   so.  what do you think. it's...  it's great, daddy.  i've got some other homework to do.  well, it's done.  want to come see it.  can i see it in the morning.   i'm sleepy.  i added those cup holders you wanted.  couldn't find any velvet for the seats, though.  that's okay.  i'm sure it looks amazing.  thanks for all your help, daddy.  i should thank you.  it was the most fun i'd had in years.  oh, i left the paint out.  i thought we could put another coat on right before the race tomorrow.  i'll do it first thing in the morning.  great.  goodnight, princess.  yep, it's perfect.  ouch.  huh.  bailey.   oh, hi, daddy, i was just, uh...  you made another car.  but this one has been tested for speed and durability.  it's a guaranteed winner.  i know.  but it's your car, not mine.  well, muffin, that's not exactly true.  all i did was carve it and sand it and paint it...   i guess you're right.  i did sorta elbow my way in.  but what do you think of this one.  look, i even added the crosswire motors logo.  it's terrific.  i'm really proud of you, muffin.  all right, class.  are you ready to race.  all: yes.  that doesn't look anything like the drawing.  i made a few minor adjustments.  we'll race three at a time, and then race the winners against each other until we have a champion.  round one will be barnes, baxter, crosswire.  ready, set, go.  yes.  muffy is the winner of round one.  next up...  we are now ready for our grand finale.  our three finalists are lundgren, frensky, and crosswire.  good luck, francine.  you too.  go.   attaboy, george.  congratulations, george.  you are the first lakewood derby champion.   nice job.  i guess you crosswires really do have cars in your blood.  and it was neck and neck, but then george won by this teenyweeny bit.  but i still got a second place ribbon.  i bet if we had used your car, we would've won.  guess i'll just have to enter it in my own race someday.  in the meantime, why don't we go for a spin in a real car.        whicharthurcharacter are you.  i'm a dw because sometimes i get a little bit annoying.  everyone knows that everything revolves around me.  she's kind of cute.  oh, hi buster.   you're driving me nuts.  she gets a little bit crazy
