  and get along with each other.   hey.   what a wonderful kind of day    hey. what a wonderful kind of day.   hey.  arthur: hey, d.w.  hey.  whoa.   do your little brothers and sisters have to do everything you do.  arthur.  even if they're too young.  arthur: like at my birthday party.  d.w.: my turn to play.  the games are for big kids, d.w.  i'm not little.  i can play this.   what's so funny. what.  or the time she entered a basketball shooting contest just because i did.    and she won.  that was embarrassing.  d.w.: arthur.  she wants to ride a twowheeler.  arthur.  what is it, d.w..  i don't know how to stop.  peskier than a mosquito.  tadah.  arthur: hi, mrs. tibble.  have you heard about the bikeathon.  where people donate money for each mile you ride.  yes, the money's for the school.  go away.  we're riding in the bikeathon.  grandma's sponsoringus.  now, boys, i can donate to arthur, too.  thanks, mrs. tibble.     are we going riding, arthur.  you can't come.  we're practicing for the bikeathon.  so. i can ride in the bikeathon.  i don't think so.  a tricycle can't keep up with twowheelers.  i bet i can.  i'm good.  hi, buster.  did your mom say you can ride.  yeah, but i have to call every halfmile.  great. we better start getting in shape.  we can't slow down for you, d.w.  we have to practice.  you don't have to slow down for me.     whoa.      man: wow. what kind of bike that..  a twowheeler.  vroom.  vroom.  vroom.  vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom...   : vroom, vroom.  hey, d.w., it sounds like you sprung a leak.   do you like our new bikes.    i guess you can't ride in the bikeathon like us.  because it's a bikeathon not a trikeathon.   use your spoon, dear.  arthur: aw, mom, do i have to have broccoli.  arthur, if you don't eat...  father, may i serve you potatoes.  thank you, d.w.  my compliments to the chef.  everything is deeelicious.  well, how nice of you.  okay, d.w., what do you want.  i want to ride a twowheeler.  if arthur can do it, how hard can it be.  please.  too flashy.  d.w.: too angry.  too girly.  well, that'll last about an hour before it breaks.  wow.  huh.  huh.  wow.  mmm...  oh...  hmm...   i love it.  d.w.: careful, careful.  this way.  okay, put it down right there.  hmm...  is something wrong.  yup.  there.  tadah.  now it's perfect.  d.w.: i'm ready for my first lesson.  sorryi have to finish this lasagna taj mahal for the culture club.  and your mom's gone into town.   arthur.  dad: could you do me a favor and give d.w.  a riding lesson.  but, dad, we have to practice.  thanks.  you guys ride without me.  i have to teach d.w.  i'll help you.  we'll all help.  we're the best.  let's start with the basics.  this is a bicycle.  its propulsion system consists of an interlocking...  i just want to ride it, not build one.  excuse me.  d.w., the most important thing about riding is...  steering. pedaling. stopping.  going fast.  let's start with something we all agree onwearing a helmet.  you're putting it on backwards.  that is not backwards.  francine, it's covering her eyes.  no, it's notit's protecting them.    huh.   got to get home for lunch.  me, too.  me, three.  vroom.  i'll teach you more after lunch, d.w.  arthur.  how do i get down..  okay, time for your next lesson.  whee.  teach me tricks.  first, you have to learn the hand signals.  right turn...  left turn slow down and stop.  what's this mean.   i don't know, what.  hi, mr. sipple.  what's this.  what's that..  you did this.  where i come from doing that on a bike means "bring me a cabbage." i left the tub running.  bye.  let's go.  i want to hit the open road and feel the wind in my hair.  are you ready to pedal.  i'm ready.  pedal.  arthur, i don't know how to stop.  pedal backwards.    this is a very important lesson.  avoid dogs.   both: vroom.  beep, beep, beep.  d.w.: slow down.  i want the tibbles to see my twowheeler.   tommy: hey, timmylook at those doofy training wheels.    for a minute, i thought d.w.  was on areal twowheeler.   kate: aahboot.  d.w.: father this broccoli is so good i think i'd like some for dessert.  what do you want now, d.w..  arthur, tell them how well i ride.  she did good.  good. i was great.  i could ride without training wheels.  please.  i've never felt so free.  ow.  okay, let gonow.    help.  face it, dad, she's too little.  no, i'm not.  i can put the training wheels back on for the bikeathon and you can take your time learning.  i don't want any help.  i can learn this stuff myself.       whoa.   whoa.  i don't care if it takes till i'm 21 and i'm one giant scab.  i'm going to learn to do this.   all right, d.w..  you're riding great.  i know.  both: vroom.  beep, beep, beep.  vroom.  hi, tommy.  hi, timmy.    man: the bikeathon begins when i wave the green flag.  go.  do you feel grownup riding a twowheeler, d.w..  uhhuh.  twins: hi, d.w..  mom, dad, how old do i have to be to drive a car.  not a big car, just a little convertible so i can feel the wind in my hair.  i won't go fast... ipromise.  kids:and now...  well, it's kind of like riding a bike.  if you want to be a good figure skater this is what you do.  you' have to practice a lot.  girl 2: you have to know that if you try you can do what you want to do.  girl 1: take your time on everything.  don't rush through it.  practice it piece by piece, one by one.  girl 3: e you fall down a lot, and it hurts.  i fall down a lot...  but i just get back up and keep going.  you have to practice really hard so you can get the height on your jumps.  you can do all kinds of turns and jumps.  camel, sit, change set.  a onefoot axel and walleys.  waltz jump, halfloop, flip.  a flying camel.  if d.w. can learn how to ride a bike she can learn how to skate and have a lot of fun.  kids:and now...  it's my first little league game.  maybe i'll get a hit.  score a run or two.  all: arthur, arthur, arthur, arthur...  that would be great.  teammates: come on, arthur.      will you be good at baseball, arthur.  i hope so.  well, only one way to find out.  see if you can catch the famous busterball pitch.  i got it, i got it.     we made it, arthur.  we're on the same baseball team.  all right.  who else.  francine, brain, binky... hey this is going to be a great team.  catcher.  i get to be catcher.  great.  who wants to pitch.  i do. me. i do. me.   it's up to the coach to decide who gets to be pitcher.  i'm oliver frensky, and i'll be your coach this year.  hi, daddy.  hello, francine.  our motto is "teamwork." everyone pitches in.  everyone plays every position.  who's going to be our first pitcher.  wow. strike.  fantastic, brain.  who's next.  where'd it go.   outside.  nice energy, though, francine.  try again.  whoa.  inside.  once more.  right over the plate now.  right over the plate.  well, it's certainly overthe plate.   coach: okay, everybody, in the outfield.  i got it, i got it.   superb catch, binky and arthur, that leap was pure ballet.   coach: very ingenious, arthur.  very creative.   here it comes, francine.     any team that plays with francine has to have a lot of baseballs.  oh, yeah.  how about that fly ball that hit arthur on the head.  "uhduh...  where's the ball, where's the ball." right.  guys.  ready for your first game, arthur.  oh... uh, yeah.  mr. frensky.  i'm buster's mother.  nice to meet you.  buster's a fine boy, a real spark plug.  i was wondering...  is that ball very hard.  what if it hits him.  are those hats woolen.  he's allergic to wool.  excuse me, miss frensky.  think you'll top your record of 49 stray balls in one day.  very funny.  what about arthur.  maybe he could catch one for a change.  oh, yeah.  do you know what you need, arthur.  my neverfail, alwayssucceed 100%guaranteed, secret goodluck charm.  use this, and you can't miss.  i got it, i got it.  home run.  here.  i think it's broken.  ach: a great game deserves ice cream.  don't get arthur any.  he'll just drop it.   oh, don't listen to her, arthur.  i'll hold your ice cream for you.   maybe next year i'll get on a real team, and win.  well, if you didn't throw the ball over fern's head...   hey, hey, hey.  knock it off.  where'd arthur go.  i think he left.  left.  you paid attention and that's what's important.  baseball is 99% concentration.  now if he can only catch the ball.  ...  no, she's right.  that's what everybody says.  nonsensei bet right now coach frensky is talking about what a terrific team he's got.  you want me to take arthur off the team.  please, daddy.  you have to.  i'm always thinking what dumb thing he'll do next.  that does sound serious.  hmm...  well, maybe i can help you.  you'll fire him.  i've got a better idea.  i'm going to give youa promotion.  what. really.  you mean, i get to be pitcher.  even better.   come in.  arthur.  hi, francine.  was there something mean you forgot to say yesterday.  arthur, i'm the new assistant coach.  my dad told me to make sure the team works together.  my first project is you.  here it comes.  i got it, i got it.  get under it.  that's it.   ouch.  well, at least you were under it.  use your glove to keep the sun out of your eyes.  yay.  keep your eye on the ball.  keep your head steady, and follow through.   try this.  when you throw push off with your legs and use your shoulder.  legs, shoulder...  wow. you caught it.  wow. you threw it straight.  sorry i teased you so much, arthur.  well, maybe sometimes you overdo it just a little.  if i ever overdo it again, let me know.  deal.  deal.  but you know, it was kind of your fault.  w was itmyfault.  if you didn't keep striking out and dropping balls i wouldn't have had to tease you.  well, at least my pitches land in the same neighborhood.   coach: okay, team, this is a playoff game but i want you to play just like any other game.  everyone go out and have fun and remember, if you win, i buy you ice cream.  if you lose...  you drop us off at the outskirts of town.  no, binky.  if you lose, i still buy you ice cream.  i'll never see the outskirts of town.  okay, team, let's go.       strike three.  yay.  the ball didn't hit him.   it's going to arthur.  oh, i can't watch.  i got it, i got it.   throw it here, francine.  i can't watch.  you're out.     buster.  you were fantastic out there, arthur.  well, i had a good assistant coach.  just one hit, buster.   yay, we win.  beautiful try.  i thought that one was going over the wall.  yeah, good try.  we just need one hit, and you couldn't...   you couldn't have made a better try.  good job.  francine gaveme some good baseball tips.  maybe she could help you.  sure, that would be great.  well, i guess i could use some practice pitching.  let's do it.  thanks for stopping me before i teased buster the way i teased you.  sure.  thanks for helping me with my game.  see. teamwork.  yeah, but you know basketball season is coming up and if you stink at that i get to tease you all over again.   hi, everyone, it's me, buster.  if you love all the pets and animals in elwood city, you'll love all the different animals i'm filming on my travels with my dad.  whether they live on farms or in the wild, they're so much
