 crash) arthur: why..  dad: why what, arthur.  why do i have to go to a boring grownup party with you when it's sunny outside, and d.w. gets to go to the lake with emily.  because sometimes we have to do things we don't want to do.   arthur: there's no kids.  you said there would be kids.  mrs. fox told me there would be.  why.  she probably thought people would bring them.  why would she think that.  oh, all these questions.  sometimes you just can't know the answer to everything.  and sometimes you can't know the answer to anything.  yeah.  wait.  okay, arthur, we're only going to stay a little while.  just try to occupy yourself here in the meantime.  how long's a little while.  why can't grownups ever just answer a simple question.  why can't they just say, "yes, we know the answer, and this is what it is".  why. why. why. why. why.  why. why can't someone give me an answer.  man: sorry.  just doing a little bit of packing here before mrs. fox and i move to the retirement home.  "93 million miles in a balloon".  got that from granddaddy when i was your age.  why aren't you out at the party.  boring old people.  oh, sorry.  why aren't you.  boring young people.  keep it.  i have to get rid of most of this stuff, anyway.  just be careful with the loose pages.  weird. why is there a balloon in a library.  don't remember.  "lord caleb trimingham, bored, restless and, as always, "aggravated by his house staff's lack of interest "in his everlegitimate questions, "looked to the ceiling as if for answer "and was rewarded with a balloon"a hotair balloon, to be precisedescending from the rafters." what kind of answer is that.  and what questions was he asking.  "yet before young lord trimingham could express "proper irritation at the inappropriateness of a balloon in a library, he was greeted by..." dr. gustavius boles.  don't bother to get up.  just passing through.   but what are you doing here.  how did you get here.  how'd you get that balloon in that suitcase.  uh, a questioner.  sorry, i have no time at the moment.  no. wait.  so, you didn't answer my questions.  who are you. how did you....  dr. gustavius boles, as i've already informed you.  i'm a balloon explorer.  what's that.  ah, here we are. thank you for the ride.  caleb: what is this place.  what does he do here.  i don't know, sir.  i'm just your driver.      dr. boles, what are you....  oh, dear, it's the questioner.  dad: okay, arthur, time to go.  already.  why do we have to go right now.  arthur: "as lord trimingham bravely tried to brace himself for the crushing waters ahead..." we're doomed.  marvelousthat's the first thing you've said that isn't a question.  here, take this.   boles: of course.  the falls of glomach in scotland leads to a garden of the taj mahal in east india.  the what.  there are invisible connections between all things in existence.  your library ceiling, for example, is connected to the baboon cage in the cairo zoo.  i presume that answers all possible questions.  here.  you might want to wear that.  it provides oxygen and protects the body against extremes of pressure and temperature.   boles: i had expected to make this final exploration without stowaways, so be careful, that's my only spare suit.  where are we going.  i've always wondered what the sun was connected to.  mom. dad.  arthur.  the end is missing.  what are you doing up past your bedtime.  reading.  that's good... isn't it.  okay, well, thanks for looking, mr. fox.  arthur appreciates it.  he can't find any pages that might have fallen out, and he can't remember the ending, except that he thinks it had something to do with the sun.  sorry, arthur.  but how am i going to find out what happens.  arthur: yes.  one copy. fiction bou.  librarian: yes, apparently 93 million miles in a balloon was checked out ten years ago and never returned.  never returned.  whoever borrowed it moved and left no forwarding address.  but don't worry.  if he ever comes back here, i will personally revoke his library card.  oh, uh, thanks.  i'd rather have the book.  can you order another copy.  oh, no, dear.  that book is long out of print.  maybe you can buy a used copy on the internet.  "rare copy.  fair condition." order it. please.  $1,000.  oh, i'm sorry, honey.  we tried.  and that's the only used copy available.  what about posting something on a message board.  good idea. let's try it.  hey, look.  there's a movie called 93 million miles in a balloon.  we can rent it on 16 millimeter.  what's 16 millimeter.   dad: it's been 25 years since i've used this old 16millimeter projector.  hope it makes it.  it's such a cool book.  wait till you guys see.  he rides this hotair balloon into a waterfall and out into space and...  what. i can't hear you.  never mind. you'll see.  chorus:  flying high, flying low.    broadway rhythms go, go, go.    93 million tapping feet    make a sound that can't be beat.   oh, caleb, i've always wanted to star in a gustavius boles show.  i know, sally.  and93 million miles in a balloon is going to be his biggest hit yet.  i thought they were going to fly into the sun.  this isn't in the book.  boles: sing it, sally.  this show is going to make you a star, or my name ain't gustavius boles, the biggest producer on broadway.   it always seemed that old broadway    was 93 million miles away    but with the help of this balloon    i'll get to broadway... soon.   arthur: "93 million miles in a balloon.  "the novel's exploration plot "was dropped by producer tunesmith bugsby brown "and turned into a backstage musical to showcase his songwriting skills."  well, i'd rather see a good musical any day than some silly story about balloons in outer space.  yeah, i don't think it's right to make movies about flying into the sun.  what if some poor kid tried to imitate it and got hurt.  but what about the ending.  there couldn't be a logical ending to that book.  it is physically impossible to fly into the sun.  arthur: but there is still an ending.  just because you didn't read it doesn't mean...  yeah, if a tree falls in the forest, does anybody hear it.  of course. yeah.  buster means if a tree falls in the forest and there's no one to hear it, does it make a sound.  what. there's not even insects there to hear it.  what kind of forest has no mosquitoes.  i just want to know the ending.  mom: um, arthur.  i found the pages.  i just washed your jacket and...  looks like they were in your pocket.  no.  no... no.  arthur: i'm sorry, dr. boles.  i didn't even think to look in my jacket, and now...  foolishness is no excuse.  well, we'll just have to keep going. wait.  how can you keep going when we don't know what the ending is.  if a balloon explorer only proceeded knowing in advance what he was to discover, no discoveries would be made at all.  but there's nothing to discover.  there's no ending.  we'll find another one.  there's only one ending to a story, dr. boles.  dad: good news.  somebody responded to your post on the message board.  a woman who lives over in shelbytown found a copy when she was cleaning out her garage.  i can't believe it.  i'm actually going to find out the answer.  sure was nice of her to drop off the book for you.  that clan of eight kids she's got must really keep her busy.  well, aren't you going to read it.  no.  this is kind of what historians go through, piecing together the past from clues.  they often reach dead ends, too.  but this isn't history.  this is a story, with an ending.  weknowthere's an ending.  well, we know there were all sorts of endings in history, too.  we just don't know what all of them were...  yet.  it's kind of exciting.  i'm never going to find the ending, am i.  you don't know that.  it's hard to predict the future.  of course, there's nothing to stop you fromimaginingwhat you want it to be.  you know, dad, maybe you're right.  i mean, maybe i could write myself an ending.  kind of... a sequel.  there you go.  i think you've found yourself an answer.  good night.  dad: lights off.   what's so amusing.  the ending.  i finally found it.  and it was completely colored by babies.   you know, you're right, dr. boleslet's keep going.  the future's out there, the unknown.  let's explore it.   sometimes people just can't tell you the answer to something and you have to find it out for yourself.  all right. yeah.  kids: and now...  this is my ending for the story.  this is the ending that i wrote.  arthur wanted an ending to the story.  we wrote pretty exciting endings.  "boom." "zoom. 'boy, don't you love the speed.' asked dr. boles." "as they got to the sun, the hot air balloon "started to get hot.  lord caleb's feet started burning." "'trust me, we're safe,' says dr. boles, 'but i hope you brought a pair of shortsit's awful hot up there.'" "ah." "the engine starts propelling the balloon "straight towards the sun.  "the space suits were made with a very, very expensive, nice fabric." "'apparently the sun has transported us to an unknown place.'" "just then, dr. boles noticed that his eyes were getting blurry." "they go and go and go into a comet close to earth.  "the comet smashes into the hot air balloon.  now the balloon is heading towards mars." "they got sucked in and zoomed upward.  "it felt like an icy shower.  "'uh, this is very refreshing,' dr. boles said.  "my skin has been very dry lately and no skin balm will get the feeling off.'" "the balloon started to go faster.  "the screen said five, four, three, two...  'oh, no.'" "they opened their umbrellas and they floated down.  "they floated down from the sky and landed safely." "and landed in a parade." "they stumbled up and finally gained their strength." "zoom. the balloon goes off again.  "'where are we." boles asks.  "'my kitchen.' caleb shouts.  'i'm home.'" "'boy, was that a great, exciting, "extreme adventure.' caleb said, taking a spoonful of ice cream." "then caleb woke up and realized he was just dreaming." "the end." kids: and now...  one thing about being a kid is that you have lots of bosses.  ready for testing.  with the help of brain's new bossometer, i can measure just how bossy someone is.   i'll load the top and then you can load the bottom.  arthur: dad bosses by setting an example.  tough, but fair.  and then there's mom.   oh, arthur, will you push kate for a while.  she just loves it when you do.  she bosses by acting as if she's not bossing.  hmm...  she barely registers.  for tomorrow, i expect you to complete 25 word problems, read a biography of george washington and write a report on it...    there's no question who's the boss in ratburn's class.  but up ahead is the bossiest boss of all.  out of my way.    hey.  d.w.: look, mom. it's over here.  that's it.  that's the one.  it's a marie antnet doll.  she comes with ten dresses, three wigs, a removable mole on her chin and says five things in french.   doll: oohlala.  see.. and look.  she comes with her own cake and cake plate.  it's a little pricey.  but it has to be this one.  emily will love it.  it's perfect for her.  well...  please.  it'll be the best present ever.   hi, emily.  happy birthday.  merci beaucoup, mon amie.  aren't you going to open it.  oh, no,ma cherie. there's a schedule. see.  here's all the stuff we're doing today.  and here's where i open presents.  last.  hmph.       why is the balloon yellow.  they should have made the whole thing in color.  why doesn't anybody talk.  this movie stinks.   boy: make a wish.  make a wish. make a wish.    hurry it up, already, before you turn six.  i love it.  here.  this is how you open a present.  see. it's a marie antnet doll.  thank you, d.w.  no, wait.  let me show you what it can do.  oohlala.  mom: how was the party.  okay.  peekaboo.   but emily doesn't know the first thing about opening presents.  hello.  hi, emily, it's d.w.  want to come over and play today.  that's awfully nice of you, d.w., but i can't.  i have to stay home and practice...  um, conjugating french verbs.  oh, okay. bye.    hello.  hi, james, it's d.w.  want to come over and play.  gee, uh, that sounds like fun, d.w., but, uh, i can't.  i have to dust my stamp collection. bye.  timmy: gotcha.  no, i got you.  hey.  can i play, too.   tommy: run for your life.  what's gotten into them.  hey, arthur. where are you going.  i'm just going to the library, d.w.  great, i love the library.  i thought you were supposed to play with your friends today.  uh, they're too busy.  busy doing what.  emily had to concentrate on verbs.   what about your friend james.  he had to dust stamps.    sounds like he's finished.  maybe he can play now.    run for your life.  what are you, a monster.  no, even scarier.  i'm d.w.   i don't care.  i didn't want to play with them anyway.  .  are you okay.  friends. who needs them.   i don't need any friends.  i can have fun all by myself.   why, there's hundreds of them.  they're unstoppable.  what you watching.  children of the beans.  it's a little scary.  maybe you shouldn't watch it.  i can take it.  why don't you play with your friends.  i don't have any.  i thought you were going to play by yourself.  that was before i knew how boring i was.  why doesn't anyone want to play with me.  i'm the life of the party.  well, you're kind of...  what.  what.. well, what am i.  well, remember the last time james came over.  no, no, no.  you're not doing it right.  you're supposed to be a prince.  i don't know, d.w.  i don't think i'm good at this game.  sure, you are...  if you'd quit doing it wrong.  now, once more, from the top with feeling.   i can't help it if people do things the wrong way.  yeah, but sometimes you do things wrong, too.  like that time in gymnastics class.   that's the spirit.  better luck next time.  .  watch this.   whoaoh.  wait, that didn't count.  i get to go again.  d.w., we don't push other students.  you should apologize.  both: we're sorry.  not you, boys.  you haven't done anything wrong.  we haven't.  it wasn't my fault.  those tibbles messed me up.  yeah, but you have to be fun to have fun.  otherwise, kids aren't going to want to play with you.   it's everyone else who's no fun.  they should all be more like me.  move over.   they're replicating faster.  no place is safe.   can you come out and play.  sure.  me first, me first.  hey, that's not fair.  i can't help it if you do it wrong.   can i play, too.  no.  that's mine.     you do it wrong. you do it wrong.  give it back. give it back.  i saw it first. you do it wrong.  let go of it.  arthur: d.w.  d.w., wake up. all: this isn't right.  you do it my way.  mom says its time for your gymnastics class.  it was awful.  i was everywhere.  uhoh.  here comes d.w.  she's going to hog the balance beam again.  i'm going to hide in the bathroom.  hey...  we know, we know. you first.  you can have it to yourself.  no.  i mean, what i was going to say was... "me last." i always go first.  you guys should go ahead of me this time.  it looks like a trap.  emily, you go first.  you'll just say i did it wrong.  no, i won't, i promise.   that was so...  close to being perfect.  you just need more practice.  you can have my turn.   it helps if you hold your arms out more.  that works for me.  you've got it.   thanks, d.w.  you go next. no, no.  you can go next.  no, you.  go ahead, d.w.  but i already said i'd go last.  she's being nice.  oh, yeah.  we can be nicer.  yeah, take my turn.  no, she should have my turn.  hey, i gave her my turn first.  hey, want to come over after class and practice cartwheels.  tommy: that doesn't mean you get to go last.  timmy: does, too.  tommy: does not. does, too.  does not. does, too.  does not.  hi, i'm marc brown.  i write and illustrate thearthurbooks.  there's a secret about thearthurbooks that i bet you didn't know.  in almost all thearthurbooks, i hide the names of my kids: "tolon," "tucker" and "eliza." this is probably one of the hardest to find the name hidden.  if you look very carefully on arthur's desk, the pencil holder has eliza's name.  the other names are hidden on the ends of these baby beds in the hospital.  see if you can find their names.  captioned by media access group at wgbh access.wgbh.org visit us online at...  you can find arthur books and lots of other books, too, at your local library.  access.wgbh.org  and everybody that you meet    has an original point of view    and i say hey.   hey.   what a wonderful kind of day    if we could learn to work and play    and get along with each other.   hey.   what a wonderful kindof day.   hey.   what a wonderfulkind of day.   hey.  funding forarthur is provided by...  chuck e. cheese'sproud supporter of pbskids, who know kids should act their age, especially when they're having fun.  pbskidswhere a kid can be a kid.  and by contributionsto your pbs station from...  every week...  that's me.  martha speaks is proof positive...  do we love llamas, people.  ...there's nothing like a talking dog.  hello.   you guys are really irritating.  does "irritating" mean "fun".  on your mark, go.  martha speakson pbs kids.  wow.    hey, want to hear a fun rhyme.  is it about a dalmation.  it's a rhyme about a clam named sam who is best friends with a lamb named pam.  sam said, "hey, pam would you likesome bread and jam." i'd rather havea peanut butter sandwich.  hey, that doesn't rhyme. )
