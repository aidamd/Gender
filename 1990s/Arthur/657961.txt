 arthur: when you join a team or a club there are rules to obey.  all: ugh.  arthur: what would happen if no one followed the rules.   all: ugh.    what's the score.  arthur: to join the library, you have to agree to return your books on time or it's not a library.  in the swim club, you have to know how to swim...  who wants to waste time learning how to swim.  bombs away.  help. save me.  arthur: for obvious reasons.   binky. stand up.  huh.  whew.  so you see how important rules can be...  to pass this house you have to pay a dollar and hop on one foot.  sometimes.   hi.  mr. haney has an announcement about the strawberry festival parade.  only three weeks left to complete your costumes.  i'll be a strawberry shortcake made of real strawberries.  haney: i'll be king of the button island float atop this 30foottall fake tree.  we have to work on our float.  i know, i told everyone to meet in the tree house.  arthur: here are our possible floats: buster's "festival of food" idea.  we all ride a giant revolving pizza dressed as the major food groups: mushrooms, pepperoni and anchovies.  anchovies. yuck. next.  brain: that's mine.  we ride the nucleotide chains of a dna double helix.  here's my backup idea.  we all wear our baseball uniforms.  that's a good one.  i like that.  francine: oh, no.  don't you like it.  not that... that.  it's arthur's dwonky little sister again.  ugh, she follows him everywhere.  what if this was the "float club" for members only.  we can try it...   but she probably won't fall for it.  hi, guys.  what are you doing.  this is a meeting of the parade float clubmembers only.  great. how do i join.  uh...  "members must be able to kick a ball out of the yard." : okay, go ahead.  i'll break my foot if i kick that.  then you're not in the club.  you kick it.  everyone in the club has to, right.  "the kicking rule is hereby canceled.  you must draw a funny picture of mr. ratburn to join."  all done.  francine: sorry.  it has to be funny.   sorry, i think it's funny.   so, i'm in the club.  arthur: to join you have to be in third grade.  francine: if you're so smart why didn't you figure that out before.  yeah.  muffy: that's that.  we could use somereal rules for this club.  like buster can't eat all the snacks.   and collect dues to fix up this place.  dues. like money.  arthur: "fix up".  what's wrong with it.  i like it like this.  ew, filth.  we need new linoleum.  a dollar a week should do it.  a dollar a week each..  hey, i'm not made of money.  i don't see why not.  binky: i wouldn't give you two cents.  if you don't pay, you're not in the club.  but i only get 50 cents a week allowance.  i'll pay for you, francine.  but nobody else.  we can't charge a dollar.  this tree house has always been free.  we don't need this shack.  we'll have our own clubhouse with computer games and everything.  it's only for people who can afford it.  imagine paying a dollar to use this crummy place.  if you think it's so crummy, you can go, too.  you want me to go.  okay. they'll have computer games.  buster: wow. that's the clubhouse..  i now declare the muffy club headquarters officially open.  the muffy club.  it's her house, buster, like it or leave it.  voila.  wow.  oh. all right.  buster: mmm.  muffy: dues are a dollar for us and two dollars for you.  why is it more for me.  because you eat like a pig.  well... it's not fair.  you don't have to belong.  then i won't.  who needs him anyway.  macaroon, francine.  what do you want.  muffy's club is rotten.  well, the parade float club has some new rulessue ellen.  "anyone can join "except buster baxter, who is a dirty traitor for joining muffy's club." those are the rules.  they're on paper.  we've got to follow them.  who wants to join their stupid old club anyway.  i'll just start my own club.  the readingcomicbooksundertheblanket club is open.  francine. i'm open.  pass it.  ha.... huh.  why didn't you kick it to me.  our club charter says we can't pass to your club.  we could have won the game.  sorry, club rules.  where are you going.  i'm sorry, we can only eat with club members.  members of my club can sit with anybody.  what's your club.  come on, i'll tell you.  don't gosue ellen.  if i can't be in your club andtalk to buster then i quit.   do we have to read comics every day.  yes. it's part of the club.  i'm going to form a club where members have fun.  binky: yeah.  aah. binky, where are you going.  i want to have fun, too.  salt and pepper, peas and carrots.  muffy: go away.  why.  you skipped yesterday.  the rules are: members must show up every day.  i was sick.  rules are rules.  you're out.  get off my property or i'm calling the police.  sue ellen: there's no air.  all that old food stinks.  why can't we meet outside.  it's the readingcomicbooksundertheblanket club.  then i quit.  mmm.  fine.  who needs you.  brain: ah, paramecium.  you're not having fun, are you.  no.  then you can't be in my club.  you have to have fun.  it's the fun club.    francine.  want to go to the sugar bowl.  i have an exciting club meeting.  oh, well...  so do i.  sue ellen, want to go to the...  don't talk to me.  this is a meeting of the reading and walking club.  anybody here. huh.   this meeting of the exciting club is now in session.     sue ellen's right.  thereisno air under there.   oh, i thought you were francine.  what are you doing up here.  looking for your friends.  where is everyone.  i don't know.    hey, arthur, can i come up.  sure.  can i come in.   hey, francine, come on up.  brain: so what's the name of this club.  i was here first, so it'smyclub.  and my club has only one rulewe ridemyfloat in the parade.   whoa.  get back. back. go away. get away from....   here they come.  i never knew d.w. was so smart.  me neither.  she has better ideas than arthur.  why didn't arthur let her join the club in the first place.   kids: and now...  this is the friendship club.  this is the animal club.  i think having a club is a good idea.  if there's nobody to play with you'll always have your club.  and i like how a lot of the people like working together.  girl: let's talk about our badges, yeah.  do you want to write "friendship" in a rainbow.  and you could draw kids holding hands or something.  or they could be on a tiny world holding hands.  i joined the friendship club.  let's just let people join in.  girl: what we do in the friendship club is we do friend things.  we don't do angry things.  we do, like, fun things.  the animal club.  everybody can be in this club.  each kid has their own animal to represent.  we're working on our cards.  our animal goes on the front.  the back says "the animal club." panda.  black rabbit.  koala.  falcon.  we try and save the animals.  all: the animal clubwe love animals.  we stick together,we don't yell.  we stay calm.  if someone quits,we let them back in.  we listenwhen people talk.  we help each other,we're always friends.  all: the friendship club.  and now...   sure, i can't wait.  well...  there's one thing that's really important to know about francine...  look out. coming through.  sue ellen: hey.  do not get between her and her bike.  francine was on two wheels while the rest of us were riding tricycles.  i lowered the chassis to get more power.  yeah, well, check out this bell.   buster: bell, schmell.  these wheels can do zero to one in 60 sec...   aah.  there's only one problem with francine's bike.  she's outgrown it.  francine: ouch. ow. ouch. ow.   aah.  mother: we can't afford to get you a new bike.  it's not fair. i'll die without a bike.  no... not that.  anything but that.  : you mustn't give up, honey.  be brave. live, i say, live.  catherine: oh, dad. grow up.  catherine's right.  and besides, i have an idea.  francine, hold that light still.  hey, watch it.  sorry, dad.  tadah.  what is it.  your new bike... well, it's actually an old new bike.  but it's in great shape.  it got me to school every day.  anyway, i know you'll appreciate it the way i did.  : thanks, dad.  at least it's big enough.  hold onthere's one or two things i'd like to check out.  you know, the brakes...  yeeha.  whoa.  muffy: what is that.  it's my new bike.  new. in what century.  too bad you couldn't get one like mine.   i could have had any bike i wanted but i chose this one.  but francine...  why.  ratburn: the wheel is thought to have been invented approximately 3000 b.c.  does anyone know what the sumerians might have done with their new wheel.  mr. baxter.  build francine's bicycle.   stop picking on francine.  it's not her fault she has to ride an ugly old bicycle and wear unfashionable handmedowns.  just think how you would feel.  : don't worry, i'll come back for you.  others: come on, francine, hurry up. francine.  where were you.  why do you have leaves in your hair.  and where's your bike.  oh... um... somewhere.  anyway, i just feel like walking.  okay, see you at the sugar bowl.  father: how's the new bike.  fine.  doesn't it ride great.  did you feel how it handles corners.  yep.  francine, are you all right.  dad, why couldn't you just get me a new bike.  we don't have enough money right now.  meanwhile, the one i gave you works just fine.   oh, no.  my bike.  oh, well, i guess that's where it belongs.  buster: hey, francine.  want to do some wheelies before school starts.  i can't, my bike was, um...  um...  um...  stolen.. are you sure.  um... yes... no... pretty sure.  can i draw, or what.  sue ellen: we just heard.  i don't get itwho would steal a piece of junk like that.  yeah, it was old.  francinemaybe it was so old it was an antique.  help.  police.  let's try not to panic.  we have to tell mr. haney.  no, wait.  let me get this straightyou were hurrying home on your bike to do your chores...  when all of a sudden...   i had no idea these kind of trucks were roaming the streets.  um... can i go home now, mr. haney.  i don't feel well.  did you think there was something fishy about francine's story.  yeah. does she expect us to believe she was hurrying home to do her chores.  i think arthur meant the bikeeating truck was fishy.  francine mustn't want us to find out who really took her bike.  of course.  because whoever it is is somebody we all know.  buster: and now the question iswhich one of us knows how to drive a bikeeating truck.  robbers on helicopters.  and you believe her.  catherine, francine's had a tough day, and you're not helping.  can we just forget about it.  i know how you feel, hon.  but maybe it'll find its way back to us.  dad, it's a bike not a dog.  anyway, someone in this room knows more than she's saying.  go away.   after you chased robbers then what.  then i wandered around with amnesia until i hit my head and all my memory came back.  that's from the movie we saw.  you'll have to do better than that if you want a new bike.  daddy.  yes, francine.  i thought i should tell you, um...  good night.  good night, sweetie.  something else you wanted to talk about.  no, thanks, dad. goodnight.  muffy: we think we know what happened to your bike.  huh.  these guys who swiped your bikedid one of them look like... this.  no.  buster: it has to be binky.  who else is big enough to steal a whole bike.  can't you forget about it.  it's not your business anyway.  we're only trying to help.  well... don't.  i say binky's behind it and it's up to us to make him confess.  how.  we threaten him. any volunteers.   you are the biggest bunch of babies.  muffy.  muffy: don't interrupt.  one of my best friends has been traumatized and if it takes a crosswire )
