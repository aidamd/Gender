it quick.  where did you have it last.  well, mom had to give some papers to mrs. tibble.  the tibble twins.  that's it.  arthur, they stole my blankie.  when we were leaving they probably slid down the bannister...   and grabbed my blankie.  how could they without you and mom seeing them.  you're right, arthur.   mrs. tibble must have thrown magic dust on us.  arthur: magic dust.  come on, arthur.  before they do something terrible with it.  the twins.  no, arthur, they've been with trixie all weekend.  when they come back i'll tell them you want to play with them.  no, i didn't...  oh,

didn't notice because i was waving to miss turner.  she's nice.  i hope you're right.  so i can catch the end ofrenegade joe.  i'm sorry, d.w.  i looked everywhere and didn't see a blankie.  however, if you check the card catalog you may find a book about blankies.  come on.  oh, no. binky barnes.  i don't want him to know i'm looking for a blankie.  oh, no, arthur.  i don't want him to know i'm reading.  arthur, that's it.  i must have lost it at the car wash.  we were going through and i felt like i was in a giant dishwasher.  the water was dripping on me because i left the window open.  then that scary giant vacuum thingie came down and while i had my eyes closed it must have sucked my blankie right out the window.  it's so simple.  i'm sorry, it only sucks up water not blankies.  hereyou can have my polishing cloth.  it's not dirty enough for her.  d.w.: well, this is the last place we went.  i guess maybe after we ate our ice cream...  i left my blankie at the table.  that's it.  i'm too tired to think up anything.  come on.  oh, no.  we can't go in there.  i don't want all those girls to know i'm looking for a blankie.     arthur.  over here.  hey, hey...  girls: hi,

these flying gorillas that are trying to rule the earth but joe infiltrates them by wearing a flying gorilla suit.  he finds their secret hideout in a cave.   i can't believe you missed it.  dad:

gold.  my camera is very, very important to me.  it's things that we would never, ever want to lose.  i have a picture of my brother.  i got this for my birthday.  my dad took me to a baseball game one time and i got this ball signed by the red sox.  it's special to me because i don't get to see my dad much.  i brung in my glass doll that my grandma bought me for my birthday when i was five.  my grandmother is special and my glass doll helps me remember her.  i won this little canine as a prize playing a game.  it gots blue eyes, see.  i brang in a picture of my baby brother because he's the only brother i got and...  and he's very cute.  i brung in my panda.  if i lost my panda i would feel bad and sad.  i brought a picture of my dad and i only get to see him on the weekends so that's why it's important to me.  if i lost it or my brothers lost it, i would be really sad.  it's really good to have a special thing.   and now...  arthur: our homework for tonight is to read all there is to know about how clouds form.  miss sweetwater's class is studying clouds, too but they just have to look at some clouds.  it looks like a bunny.  yeah, it'ssocute.  that's because our teacher, mr.

horn made of.  buster, at what temperature does ice cream solidify.  buster: herei'm suddenly not hungry.  no tougher teacher has been discovered this side of the planet neptune.  whoa.  aw, sometimes i wish mr. ratburn would just disappear.   hi.  now, class...  excuse me, i have a tickle in my throat.  plot the latitude and longitude of ulan bator.   everyone, close your eyes...  now, find your
