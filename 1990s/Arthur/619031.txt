hey, i'll take one.  i don't know, d.w.  you don't like anything and mom didn't make them, buster did.  let her have one.  buster: you were wrong, arthurshe loves it.  there's nothing that perks up a p.b.j.  like spinach.  blech.  francine: what's wrong.  you look worried.  i only have three days left.  muffy: d.w. has to see someone she admires eating spinach.  that's how our butler got our dog to try new dog food.  it just might work.  but who does she admire.  muffy: thank you.  spinach is my favorite food in the whole wide world and sometimes i just crave it.     oh...  seeing as you only

without her.  without who.  let me talk to her.  d.w., isn't there some dancing vegetable on tv.  give me the phone.  i can go wherever i want.  you said you didn't want to go, remember.  tthis restaurant might have spinach.  grandma, i'm coming to your party and i'm going to be lots of fun.  ha, so there.  you're not the boss of me, arthur read.  well, i guess there's nothing i can do.

it's just a costume.  oh, yeah, i forgot.  aah.  arthur, pirates.  oh, brother...  second, if buster's their "good friend" why does he look so nervous.  and what's in this bag, anyway.  oh, no.    you

arthur, i found it.  here's your penny.  i'll jump over the bench.  watch.  oh, no. come back.   at least it didn't hurttoomuch.  how am i doing.  great. just don't...   let go.  ow.  whoa.   ow.  nice moves, buddy.  you, too.   boy, i wish toby and slink could give us some pointers.  you don't need pointers. you need an emergency room.   come on, slink, let's go.  you aren't skating today.  are you kidding.  comicmania just opened.  strapons..  how uncool.  hey, arthur, i've got an idea.  let's go to comicmania.  arthur, look.  it's the very first issue ofbionic bunny versus technoturtle.   be careful.  it's probably worth a thousand dollars.  you couldn't pay me to take that baby comic.  if you kids want a really cool comic check outpeabrain and nuthead.     : laugh.  but i don't get it.  neither do i but they don't know that.   that peanut sure cracks me up.  he's not a peanut. he's apecan.  i think they're really starting to like us.  we just need one more thing to make it perfect.  arthur: i don't know, buster.  these are my dad's shorts.  i'm afraid they'll fall down.  trust me, arthurthis will work.  just let me do the talking.  all right, how do i look.  great. at least... i think so.  i can't really see anything.  ooh.  hey, fresh dudes.  mind if we chill your crib.  what.  me and my homefry here would like to be in your possum...  i mean, posse.  what's he trying to say.  he's asking if you could show us some cool skate tricks and let us hang out with you guys.  toby and slink:..  come on, buster, let's go.   wait, you guys.  we changed our minds.  really. really.  yeah, you two seem pretty cool.  but we'd like you to do one thing just to make sure you're cool enough.  sure, no problem.  what is it.  nothing really.  just a little... dare.  buster, what if someone we know sees us.  these guys are making fun of us.  come on, arthur, it's just a dare.  well...  all right.   mi, mi, mi, mi...     arthur: oh, no.  arthur.  sorry, buster, i gotta go.  you can't let me do this alone.  just in time.  we're going shopping and you need pants.  great. let's go now.  mom, i think arthur's sick.  he hates clothesshopping.   mary had a little lamb    little lamb, little lamb...     whose fleece was white as snow...   something weird is definitely going on.   everywhere that mary went...   buster, you know what to do.  after this, you'll let me hang out with you, right.  sure. it's just a little dare to prove you're not chicken.  hi, buster.  did those guys teach you cool skate tricks.  excuse me, arthur.  binky, i have a message for you.  what.  um, let me think...  oh, yeah.  your mother eats gym shorts.  what..   phew. that wasn't so bad.  mmm. strawberry.   oh, buster.  safe.   come on, just this one last dare.  okay.  psst.  francine.  i, uh... i need advice.  why does he need advice.  he just has to run home as fast as he can.    where's he going.  he's running home as fast as he can.  buster baxter, i'll pulverize you.  i think i have to talk to buster.  arthur: hi, buster.  have toby and slink asked you to do any more dares.  what is it this time.  "i am not allowed to talk for the whole day." that's crazy.  you can't let them make you do all these dopey things. )
