"dear mom and dad.  "happy tenth anniversary.  love, arthur." that's it.  all you're giving them is a card.  did you even make that yourself.  i picked it out and bought it with my allowance.  where's your present.  feast your eyes on this.  what is it.  it's a family portrait, see.  there's mom, dad and me.  sorry. there wasn't enough glue for you.  and the best part is, it's tin.  that's the official present of tenth anniversaries.  emily told me.  that's not tin.  it isn't.  nope. it's called a pie tin, but it's actually made of aluminum, a completely different metal.  so, i guess your portraitis no moreofficial than my card.  how sweet. thank you, arthur.  is this your beautiful creation, d.w..  yes, but it's not yourofficialtenth anniversary present.  that's coming later.  maybe you can work on it at grandma thora's.  you're staying there tonight, remember.  oh, it'll be finished way before then.  i just have to find the right materials.  ah. a night at l'auberge d'aubergine.  i hear the duck a l'orange is amazing.  only zee best formon cheri.   both: ew.  ready to set sail, tony the tanker.  ayeaye, captain.  oh, no.  sea monsters.    guys, do you have any tin.  "ten". ten what. i have ten fingers.  they're great for splashing.  mine are better.  are not.  are, too. are not.  not "ten". tin. tin.  it's a kind of metal.  i need some for my mom and dad's tenth anniversary.  oh. you mean like a tin soldier.  tommy: his name is benedict.  he sinks.  you're sure he's not made of aloonymoon.  i don't know what that is.  you can have him if you want.  for a price.  how much do you want for him.  how about ten dollars.  ten dollars.. i don't have ten dollars.  all i have is my mary moo cow doll and some glitter.  that'll do.  i'm sorry, mary, but it's for a good cause.  hey, glitter sinks, too.  oh, no.   save us.   "if i were the size of an ant, this pencil would seem as tall as a tree." oh.  buster, now isn't the time for a snack.  we only have six hours before the special.  this isn't a snack.  it's my homework, or half of it.  you're going to hand in a sandwich.  not just any sandwich, arthur.  all it has on it is an old slice of swiss without any mayo.  pretty bland, huh.  yeah, but what does that have to do with our homework.  if you hadn't eaten in three days, this would seem like a feast, see.  that's the power of perspective.  that's the power of your stomach.  i'll write a paragraph, too, but this will be my visual aid.  what have you written.  nothing.  everything i come up with is just like that movie we saw.  buster: you could write something from the point of view of this piece of cheese.  think how cozy he must feel between two soft pieces of bread.  actually, i think i'll use that.  you can think of something else.  yeah, but not here.  i have to go home.  remember, 7:00. don't be late.  you might want to make sure there's more cheese in your fridge.  you just ate your essay.  buster : no.  brain: look at the details.  i'd say this replica of a revolutionary war drummer is at least 50 years old.  yeah, yeah, but is it tin.  no. iron.  tibbles.  i knew i shouldn't have trusted them.  and to think, i traded my mary moo cow doll and glitter for this old thing.  that's a great trade.  that soldier could be worth a lot of money.  could i swap it for some tin at the tin store.  actually, tin is quite rare in north america now, but there are large deposits of it in the congo.  the congo. where's that.  africa.  i'm doomed.  arthur: "if i were the size of a dinosaur, this pencil would seem like a toothpick." : oh.  well, i still have three hours.   maybe i just need to close my eyes for a little bit.  man : let's see what happens when we reduce arthur another ten times.  hey. what's going on.  now, he can barely be seen by the naked eye.      oh, no.  i'm trapped.  is this a... a cheese sandwich.  not just any cheese sandwich, arthur.  it's the formaggio falcon.  get in.  both: whoohoo.  yahahaha.   where are we going.  the evil dr. origami has a secret weapon he's going to use to prevent bionic bunny and dark bunny from meeting.  arthur: what's happening.   so that's dr. origami's secret weapona giant paper robot.  and lookhe's folded out of a single sheet of paper.  arthur: but that's impossible.   where could he ever find a paper that big.   it's my homework.  "if i were the size of a dinosaur, this pencil would be..." i never finished it.  but... you swore you would on the rabbit ears of innishgoomah.  how could you do this to me.     it's 6:30 already.  thanks for helping us get ready, thora.  all set, and with ten minutes to spare.  you're bringing all that to buster's.  you're only going to be away one night.  it's for my costume.  buster and i are dressing up as characters frombionic bunny for the special.  you should go as someone who ruins tenth anniversary presents.  everything was perfect until you told me about aloonymoon.  i'm not even going to ask.  okay, we'll drop arthur off at buster's first, then swing by thora's, then...   hello.  david. you'll never guess where i am.  chuck greenwald's, right around the corner from your place.  oh, great. um, i'd love to talk, but...  listen, i hate to be a bother, but my car just went kaput and i'm late for the volunteer fireman's ball.  chuck's already left, so, i was wondering...  sure. we'll be right there.  great. it's at the caribou lodge.  i'll be waiting downstairs.  grandpa dave: i'm sorry.  the lodge was supposed to be on maple street.  that's what chuck said.  dad: well, somehow we've ended up on country route 10.  i think we should call the inn and tell them we're going to be a little late.  can't. no signal.  this is allyourfault.  how is it my fault.  i don't know yet, but i'll find out.  i hope they don't run out of duck.  i just hope they hold our reservation.  i can't be too late for the ball.  i'm supposed to be the square dance caller.  what if i miss the opening of the special.  that could be when "all is revealed." i'll never find any tin.  never, ever.  oh, cheer up, you glum gusses.  things could be a lot worse.    dad: happy anniversary.  buster: and now...  hey, everyone.  thanks for sending me all your reasons for why you likearthur.  here are the top ten.  this is from jaycyline, winnipeg, manitoba, canada.
