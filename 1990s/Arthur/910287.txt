way he is.  francine's dad: that's right.  keep your eyes on me.  bring your arm forward and let her fly.   do they let girls play professional football.  if not, we'll make them.  ready for golf.

a load of thisfree disgusting garbage.  let's hike through a pit of trash.  take off your shoes and squish rotten cheese between your toes.  then we'll hike through diapers.  mom, could you get dad to cancel the field trip.  why would i want to do that.  you know... so people don't find out what he does.  you sound like catherine.  why does he have to have such a stupid job that's not exciting.  isn't this something you should discuss with your father.  i knew you'd say that.  dad.  hey, just in time.  look what i found at the dump.  francine's mom: oliver.  you can practice your swing and annoy your mother at the same time.  did you want something.  oh... nothing.  thanks, dad.  i couldn't do it.  i couldn't tell him.  you better think of something.  i'm warning you, you'll never live this down.  i've got it.  what's the big secret.  where are we going.  buster: hey...  we're at the dump.  is your dad a garbage man.  can you keep a secret.  what is it.  i can keep a secret.  my dad works for a very secret organizationso secret he can't even name it.  the f.b.i..  shh.  he just pretends to be a garbage man.  it's his cover.  so whatever you do, don't blow it or...  hello, i'm francine's dad.  nice to meet you.  muffy: this place is disgusting.  if i ruin these shoes, i'm suing.  what a bunch of long faces.  no, don't tell me.  i know what you're thinking.  you're honored and amazed to meet a real, live garbage man.  it smells here.  you're right.  fantastic, isn't it.  earth and compost and fuel and smoke.   ah...  but the best thing about working in a dumpthe absolute, number one, best thing of all is...  you get to drive a bulldozer.  any questions.  is it true you're with the f.b.i..  buster.  not that i know of.  i am, however, a proud member of f.o.s.e.  federal office of spy experts.  fraternal order of sanitation engineers.  the second great thing about working at a dump is getting to crush stuff into little pieces.   francine's dad: ready... set... go.   what's really wonderful is all the great stuff you can do with garbage.  just imagine...  one day we may even build beautiful cities and roads from compacted trash.  yuck.  but in the meantime...  wow. wow. wow.  all this is made from stuff i found at the dump.  it shows what you can do with a little imagination and a lot of trash.  what are you waiting for.   the secret is out.  think catherine will ever forgive me.  we shouldn't tell her.  maybe i should get one of those jobs that comes with a tie and a briefcase.   your dad's the best.  no kidding.  is he really with the f.b.i..  well, no.  he's really a...  garbage man.  cool.  kids: and now...  all my classmates, their parents have different jobs.  my dad makes concrete.  my dad grinds up these rocks to make concrete.  my mom is a letter carrier and she walks ten miles until her route is finished and usually she wears a blue shirt and dark blue pants.  my father's a plumber and he has to fix toilets and stuff.  if you had a leak in your pipes, then you would call my dad.  that's my father and me and that's the pipe that's leaking.  girl: my mom's a nurse.  my mom gave me a ste...  a steth...  a stethoscope.  this thing.  she cares for people when they're sick.  my mom uses a stethoscope in her work.  my dad's a fire fighter.  my dad goes to schools to show kids about fire fighters and how you shouldn't be afraid of them if you have a fire at your house because they're just normal people.     boy: my dad makes concrete.  girl: my mom is a letter carrier.  boy: my dad's a plumber.  girl: my mom's a nurse.  all: we all work together.  and now...   sometimes i wonder if life would be easier if i lived with a different family like if i had the brain's parents...  wow, a new species of mushroom.  man: son...  what are you doing.  i told you to let the robot clean up.  now you have more time for homework.  great.  well, maybe that wouldn't be so great.  but what if i lived with binky's family.   get out of here, i got to clean the room.  how come you're cleaning it.  i dibsed it first.  you did not.  sure did.  sure did not.  all right, if you really want i guess you can clean it this one time.   loser.  but i guess living here's okay for now.  stop.  d.w. don't.  great, now i have to clean up again.    muffy: i'll be the hostess for the tea party and you, mr. fuzz, will be...   tea, mr. fuzz.  muffy: want hot chocolate.  it's mr. fuzz's fav...   not on the cakes.  not on me...  no.  whew.   false alarm.  muffy, do you think maybe you have...  an allergy.  no.  mother: money.  no, honey, sniff it.  maybe you're allergic.  not funny.  no crosswire was ever allergic to money.  it has to be something here.   i think i know what it is.    francine's right.  any time i want to sneeze all i have to do...  that's enough now, muffy.  it will be a couple of days before the carpets are removed.  i got us a room at the elwood arms.  the elwood armsthat tacky place.  ed, we can't stay there.  francine: i know.  muffy can stay at my house.  really. could i stay at francine's.  please.  only if it's all right with francine's family.  of course it is.  they'll love to have you.  what is going on here.  muffy is staying with us for a couple of days.   man: where shall i place this, miss.  francine: muffy...  you already brought a tv.  what if i want to watch two things at once.   over here.  excuse me, i know this is probably unimportant but there was barely enough room for two peoplebeforethis.  catherine, how would you like your own room.  my own room.  my own room...   no, a little more to the left.   that's perfect.  let's go back to the statue.  muffy.  what.  i'm not your servant.  i'm sorry, francine.  i just wanted your room to look perfect.  can you ever forgive me.  sure.  i'm sorry.  me, too.  now, just move the statue a little to the left.   mother: muffy, francine, dinner.  thank goodness.  with all this moving, i'm famished.  whoa, now let me get this straight.  you want me to eat food cooked last night that got cold and was cooked again.  mother: it's called "leftovers." i call it "vomitrocious." muffy: there's something wrong with your tv.  you only get three channels.  we can get one mor but you have to put the antenna on your head.  want to give it a try.  no v.c.r., no video games.  we studied this period in school.  soon we invent the wheel, right.  father: football, anybody.  i've got a better idea.  let's get ice cream.  friday nights are ice cream nights.  tell you whatsince muffy's our guest, why don't we break with tradition and get ice cream right now.  muffy: and a scoop of ham ripple and sprinkles and nuts...  do we get ice cream every tuesday now.  we need to try to make muffy feel at home, francine.  just think how hard it must be for your sister to adjust to living at muffy's.    hurry up in there, ducks, bedtime.  i've been thinking.  why doesn't your family have as much money as my family.  that's a good question.  all i know is there are some perfectly nice people who are rich and some equally nice people who aren't.  besides, what would i do with money.  could i buy a better family.  no, but you could get more tv channels.  i think i could live without that.  i'd rather spend time with francine and her friends.  francine: shark attack.  ahh, you got me.  this is all very heartwarming but you're hurting my feet.  hey, we can walk to school together.  walk... all the way to school.  are you joking.  i'll see you there.  how did you get here so fast.  mother: francine...  you forgot your lunch.  you want my driver to take you back.  muffy: what happened to the electricity.   man: and now the little girl jumps on the pony's back...  and now the pony has begun to fly and now there's a rainbow.  give it a rest, bailey.  it's just not the same.     francine: hello.  woman: this is your neighbor.  what's going on.  i was listening to that.  would you turn that music down, please.  you can't play it that loud, muffythe neighbors.  let me get this straight: i can't have the food i like i can't watch the tv i want, and now i can't play my music.  look, muffy, if you don't like it why don't you just go home.  well, maybe i will.  i'm pretty tired of being poor.  fine.  fine.  francine's dad: we were too much for muffy.  don't call her that.  her name is muffy rotten stinkweed crosswire...  spit.  wow.  strangely enough, rotten stinkweed is my own middle name.  do you think we could be related.   daddy, please.  hello.  i just want to tell you i'm leaving even if i die sneezing.  may i speak to her.  hello, muffy.  look, if you leave, who's going to play football with us.  oh, please...  tell francine i heard that.  i wish you'd reconsider.  muffy: oh, okay, i'll stay.  whoa, whoa, whoa.  aren't you going to askmeif you can stay.  excuse me, mr. frensky.  someone wants to talk to me.  okay, francine, am i allowed to stay.  no...   you aren't.  you've been rude and selfish.  wwwhat.  maybe i was mean to muffy...  but she only cared about herself.  maybe muffy's just not used to living in a house with different rules.  you two should talk about it at school tomorrow.  i hope she doesn't sneeze to death.  muffy.  francine...  i wanted to tell you i'm sorry i was so rude.  i really did like staying at your house.  where's your limo.  i decided to walk with you today.  really.  you aren't going to faint or something.  i'm having bailey follow.  i even miss leftoversthe hotel didn't have them.  francine, do you think...  what.  the carpet's almost out, but... do you think i could stay one last night with you.  could you survive with three tv channels.  if i can survive walking all the way to school i can survive anything.  i'm serious.  are we there yet.  how much farther.  i think i have a blister.  hi, everyone, it's me, buster.  hold onto your hats because i'm heading out of elwood city and into the country.  on my trip with my dad i'm seeing
