  and i say hey.   hey.   what a wonderful kind of day    if we could learn to work and play    and get along with each other.   hey.   what a wonderful kind of day    hey. what a wonderful kind of day.   hey.  arthur: hey, d.w.  hey.  whoa.   hey, everyone, i have great... news.  two things.  all: what, arthur.  mr. rogers is coming to school tomorrow.  wow. really. mr. rogers.  that's...  muffy: ahem.  what's the matter.  do they think we're babies or something.  oh, i adore mr. rogers.   it's a beautiful day in the neighborhood...    what else, arthur.  um... nothing, never mind.  rogers: you look a little sad, arthur.  he always looks like that even when you're staying with us.  let's sing a song and cheer him up.  no, no, it's all right.   wait. come back.    arthur, maybe you're too old for mr. rogers now but you enjoyed him when you were d.w.'s age so let's not spoil it for her.  but...  my mom lived in your neighborhood as a kid.  rogers: that's right, d.w.  i knew her when she was just about your age.  wow. that must have been a long time ago.  will you be living with us forever.  oh, no, i have a family who wants me back home.  when do you have to go.  tomorrow, after i visit arthur's school.  why have mr. rogers stay at your house...  shh.  if you don't tell anybody.  because we don't want everyone coming over here and asking for autographs.  you're doing that thing with your glasses that you do when you fib.  rogers: arthur. d.w..  where's the nearest mailbox.  i have some postcards to send to my friends.    it's a beautiful day here at arthur's house    a neighborly stay here at arthur's    would you be mine.    could you be mine.    it's very easy, mr. rogers.  no, no, it's not.  it's hard, complicated.  i'll do it.  thanks, but i can mail them.  no, i've got them.  you stay here, mr. rogers, i'll do it.  just stay here.  he's like this all the time.   oops.  arthur, what are you....  sorry, sorry, just, uh... mailing a few postcards.  wait a minute.  this isn't your postcard.  it's signed "fred." that's because i'm changing my name.  i'm sending these postcards to try out new names.  do you like fred.  how about jasper.  that's another.  junius.  uh...   what am i doing.   yay.  wow. that was great.  arthur plays the piano, too.  show mr. rogers, arthur.  uh, well...  maybe arthur doesn't feel like it right now.  maybe later.  you could take me on that walk around your neighborhood, d.w.   i feel like playing.  i feel like playing piano.   very good, arthur.  arthur: let me see, did i play "the happy boat".  four times.  you could be a fine musician someday.  come on, mr. rogers.  i'll show you my neighborhood.  i didn't play you my scales.  arthur, mr. rogers is going to die of boredom.  i promised d.w. she could take me around before it got too late.  maybe you'd come, too.  you can't go.  what.  what if somebody recognizes you from the tv.  they'll want autographs and...  a disguise. that's it.  i'll go get you a disguise.  i don't think i need a disguise but i think you're not feeling good about something.  me.   wait, i have a better idea.  that's a very impressive statue.  he looks like he's about to say something very important.   arthur, this beard itches.  why do i have to wear it.  it's so nobody will see...  so mr. rogers can...  you're touching your glasses again.   look, mom, it's mr. rogers and he's with two of the seven dwarves.  i'm going to see them.  i want to show you something.  this way.  wait for...  me.   this way, mr. rogers.  garbage. you wanted to show mr. rogers people's garbage.  no, uh...  buster: mr. rogers.  is that really you.  it certainly is.  what's your name.  i forget.  oh, brother.   how do you know dopey and sneezy.  look, the joke shop.  and that's where grandma thora parks her car when she goes to bingo.  arthur: you can't keep secrets but don't tell anybody mr. rogers is staying with us.  i never tell secrets.  hey, there's prunella and the brain.  where are you going.  i want to tell everybody about...  hey, you're right about mei cannot keep a secret.  arthur looks distinguished with facial hair.  he's been acting weird all day.  he wanted me to call him fred.  arthur's suffering from psychological stress brought on by homework.  it even happens to me sometimes.  no, no, that's not it.  what is it, rubella.  do you see something.  it's just as i fearedzombies.  zombies are here in elwood city.  i don't think...  hush.  hush, brain.  your friend arthur is under a hypnotic spell.  it's up to us to break the trance before he turns us all into zombie slaves.  it looks so good.  would you like a roll, buster.  does king friday ever get in the trolley and come out to see you.  oh, brother.  king friday usually stays in makebelieve except when he flies in the purple jet.  wow.  what about daniel striped tiger.  look at his drooling, idiotic face.  they've done something with his brain.  i don't know, buster always looks that way.  if we don't do something soon, we'll all be...  you're both acting silly.  i'll prove it to you.  i'll ask arthur if he needs help with homework.  you watch.  no, go away.  i mean, thank you.  buster can help with homeworkbye.  buster helping with homework.  those zombies must take us for idiots.  we have to take quick action if we're going to save your friends.  one time on your show, you learned a dance and i learned it, too.  rogers: wow, you remembered that really well, buster.  soon we'll all be making fools of ourselves for their stupid zombie entertainment.  eek.  rogers: arthur, i wonder if we could talk.  if i'm embarrassed about something...   excuse me.  down, down.  quickly, we must find another window.  woman: i know, grace, i said the same thing...  wait a minute.  what have we here.  oh, my gosh, grace.  burglars at the read house.  got to go.  rogers:  in the long, long trip of growing    there are stops along the way    for thoughts of all the soft things    and a look at yesterday...   aw. he was just getting to the good part.  go home now, but you can't tell...   are those sirens.  sounds like they're right outside.   it was a strange day in the neighborhood when mr. rogers came to visit.  the suspicious goingson turned out to be nothing more than a visit from an old family friend.  i wondered where you were hiding.  i think maybe i'm sick.  in fact, i may be too sick to go to school tomorrow or even ever again.  if i'm feeling mad or sad or glad about something i try to tell somebody about it.  i just don't want everyone to think i'm a...  that i like... i mean...  that you're a little kid anymore.  yeah... i mean, no offense.  sometimes you feel you're too old for certain things.  i don't want people to make fun of me.  real friends don't make fun of real friends.  and your friends seem like real friends.  they all seem to be concerned about you.  at least nobody at school watches the news.  arthur, i saw your house on tv.  i have a tape if anyone didn't see it.  did mr. rogers really stay with you.  well...  did he change his shoes.  did he bring picturepicture.  mr. rogers. he's just for babies.   it's a beautiful day in the neighborhood    a lovely day    for a neighbor...   m... m... mister...  you must be binky barnes.  arthur's told me about you.  he did.  i mean... can i have your autograph.  i just want to say how much i've enjoyed my time here in elwood city.  now, does anybody have anything to ask or tell me.  binky: mr. rogers...  did you stay at arthur's house yesterday.  i think arthur can answer that, binky.  well... that is, uh...  i mean...  yes, binky, he did.  whoa.  can i have your autograph, too.  sure.  kids: and now...  i'm maxthis is my kindergarten class.  how did mr. rogers get to be onarthur.  how do you think they turned me, mr. rogers into an animated character.  tough question.  they put him in the tub, and then he, like, goes under water and then he turns, like, into a cartoon.  boy: put him inside a box and then the guy taps the box two times and he changed into a cartoon character.  film him like arthur except, like, with a different animal.  the picture was in marc brown's head and it turned out that he created an aardvark for me and then the animators took that and made a lot of pictures so that together it looked like they were moving through animation.  max: you have to animate him with a character with a voice.  we're in the recording studio to add the voice to the picture.  director: fred, number 39btake one.  "i wondered where you were hiding, arthur." so the aardvark has mr. rogers' voice.  "you don't want them to think you're a little kid anymore." fred, that's a wrap.  anybody could make animation.  max: my class is real but we could be animated.  and now...  francine's my friend, but she can be hard to get along with.  anybody can be a sore loser but francine can be a sore winner.  oh, that makes me so mad.  but you just won.  i should've won by more.  and she likes to argue.  is not. is, too.  is not. is, too.  brain...  give up.  you can't win.  yes, i can.  no, you can't.  yes, i can.  no, you can't.  can, can, can.  can't, can't, can't.  and this is what she's like in agoodmood.      oh.  oh, thank you.  attention, students.   exciting news.  this is the week of the teachers' charity carnival.  fun, fun, fun.  see your teachers perform and don't miss my fabulous magic and sleight of hand...   oops.  that is all.  the carnival should be fun.  as long as ratburn doesn't do another puppet show.  : laugh or you'll get extra homework.   fern: i disagree.  i like mr. ratburn's shows.  anyone smarter than a rock knows those puppet shows are boring kid stuff.  guess she didn't want her dessert.  are you going to apologize to fern.  apologize for what.  you hurt her feelings.  she'll get over it.  aren't you worried she'll get mad.  fern.  that mouse.  what's she going to do, be quiet at me.  ooh, i'm so scared.    hey, get out of my way, buster.    what are you laughing at.     what's that.  it's my cartoon.  francine: "out of my way.  "i'm better than everyone.  i'm better than people who are better than me."    is this cow supposed to be me.  how could it be.  frank is a boy.  admit it, fern.  it is, too, francine.  frank is loud and rude and insulting...  stop helping me, muffy.  cows are females and bulls are males.  a cow wouldn't be named frank.  it would be named franc...   that's as funny as biting an apple and finding half a worm.   good morning.  mr. haney wants to know what you're doing for the carnival.  a puppet show"the manyheaded hydra versus sinbad the sailor." i'll conduct a happy singalong with a prize for the happiest singeralonger.   you don't look very happy.   i think i need to sing someone a song right now.  i think not.  oh, come on, let's sing.  no.   i like fudge, i like fudge    if you ask me what i like, i say, "i like fudge."   what will you do for the carnival.  my famous fortuneteller act.  "you will be taking a trip." sweetwater:  i like fudge, i like fudge...    i didn't mean right now.  sweetwater: ms. tingley, a little song is just what you need.  haney: ms. tingley.  eek.  just in time to rehearse my grand finale: i saw you in half.  me.  oh, it's foolproof.  here, let me demonstrate with this board.  it only looks like i'm cutting it but in reality...  oops.  ms. tingley. wait.  your comic was so good, i drew one.  mine's called "the big, clumsy moose with big feet named franny." her feet are named franny.  i'll do one.  binky: me, too.  i can do a better one.  brain: oh, yeah.  ready to sing.   why not smile. why not smile.    do you think you're gonna break your face.     why not smile.   come back, ms. tingley.  sue ellen: look, "franny foghorn."  "frantic frog"...  "fran the stinky sneaker".   brain, did you do this.  it's funny.  i think maybe this is bothering francine.  she'll get over it.  francine, uh...  go eat an ant sandwich, arthur.  cartoons and stones can't break my bones.  wait, you haven't seen mine.  give it to me, i want to read that.  "the giant slime that came to school."  ratburn: 3,630,279,148 divided by 7,681.  quickly. quickly.  arthur: "all the kids were at school learning math and then it happened."  francine: i'm here.  arthur: "a giant slime..."  "came to school." do the math or begone, large slime.  oh, yeah.  "the big slime  our teacher."   "it wasn't all good.  "the slime made everyone do its rotten bidding like play only games itwas good at."  ptooey.  i win again.  all: this rots.  arthur: "bionic bunny told it to leave." slime, go away.  arthur: "it  him, too." know how to play go fish.  arthur: "the slime was unstoppable, until..." buster: boy, i'm hungry.  arthur: "it was dark...  so the boy didn't realize he was eating slime." mmm... lime.    mmm...  cut that out.  arthur: "the boy who would eat anything chased the slime." come back. you're delicious.  arthur: "and he...  the whole thing."  thank goodness you eat like a pig.  you're welcome.   i would eat a giant slimeif it was lime slime.   the teacher charity carnival is about to begin.   boy, francine, you left your comics everywhere.   hmm...   finally, great art you can eat.   mcgrady: fern.  i was reading these comics.  that francine sounds just terrible.  she's the worst.  if you get all the kids who drew these i have a way to make her look really silly.  sure, i'll be back in a sec.  mcgrady it's all in fun.  when you pull the rope that green gloop i made will pour on her.  here she comes.  be very quiet and wait till i say "green gloop." that's your cue to pull the rope and dump the gloop on her.  this is going to be great.  kids: shh.  ah, someone who wants their fortune told.  sit down, please, and concentrate.  i see... a cow and a foghorn.   that's me.   francine: what's that.  mcgrady: uh, the spirits are restless.  and i see a bully bulldozer.  i never saw that one but it's probably me.  that's you.  and a stinky sneaker.  that's funny, yes.  i guess.  but i see that you are not laughing.  mrs. mcgrady, i wish they'd stop making fun of me.  i shouldn't have called fern a mouse but why are they so mean.  did you hear that.  i can't believe it.  francine has feelings.  yeah...  tissues to your left, dear.  i see one more thing.  ah, yes, here's a cartoon of you as... green gloop.   i said there's a cartoon of you as green gloop.  green gloop.  i just wish they'd stop.  i think you came to the right fortuneteller, dear.  thank you, mrs. mcgrady.  goodbye.  it was such fun making fun of her we didn't think how it made her feel.  i always say, never serve anyone a stew that you wouldn't want to eat yourself.  wait up, francine.  wait up.  oh, by the wayyou better think first before you dump gloop on somebody.  it might hurt their feelings.  maybe you're right.  i learned something today.  better catch your friends.  wow, way to go, francine.  come back.  we're about to begin.  for the hundredth time, ms. tingly you have nothing to worry about.  hi, everyone, it's me, buster.  if you love all the sports we play in elwood city, you'll love the kids i'm filming on my travels with my dad.  check out what everyone's playing.  i'm getting into the action, too, and sending it back to my friends in elwood city on my very own video postcards.  they'repostcards from buster.   visit us online at pbskidsgo.org.  you can findarthurbooks and lots of other books, too, at your local library.  bh educational foundation]   what a wonderful kind of day    if we could learn to work and play    and get along with each other    you got to listen to your heart    listen to the beat    listen to the rhythm, the rhythm of the street    it's a simple message and it comes from the heart    believe in yourself    for that's the place to start    and i say hey.    hey. what a wonderful kind of day    if we could learn to work and play    and get alongwith each other    hey. what a wonderfulkind of day.    hey.   kids come in all shapes, sizes and abilities.  at cvs caremark, through our program all kids can, we envision a world where all of these children can come together to learn, play and succeed.  that's why we're proud to sponsorarthuron pbs.  chuck e. cheese'sproud supporter of pbskids, who know kids should act their age, especially when they're having fun.  pbskidswhere a kid can be a kid.  and by a grant from the united statesdepartment of education through the corporationfor public broadcasting and by contributionsto your pbs station from: )
