  and get along with each other  hey. what a wonderful kind of day  hey. what a wonderful kind ofday  hey.  arthur :.  hey.  whoa.   dr. jake : good evening, elwood city.  well, the sun may be setting, but the temperature is rising.  you think this is bad, wait till tomorrow.  you'll be able to fry eggs on your driveway.  so crank up those aircons and stay tuned to dr. jake, the weather maestro, for the latest on the heat wave.   okay, just a few more questions and we'll be done.  now, ed, i noticed you deducted your shoes on your schedule c.  thanks, honey.  move over.  this is the only really cool spot in the whole house.  are there any ice cubes left.  things have a way of disappearing in that freezer.  there's plenty of ice, d.w.  mr. read: arthur, could you help me carry something.  there better be some of this lemonade left when i come back.  trust me, arthur.   this is the biggest ham i've ever seen.   it's for a graduation party i'm catering tomorrow.    it just fits.  thank goodness.  it needs to stay cold until tomorrow.  ed, ii just don't think dental floss can be counted as a business expense...   ed. ed.  hello.   hey.  where'd the cold air go.     dr. jake: yes, sirree, elwood city is having a blackout.  no word yet on when it will be over, but dr. jake, your weather maestro, is sure it won't be long.   can we watch the blackout on tv.  there is no tv.  a blackout means there's no electricity.  no electricity, no tv.  no tv..  will there be tv tomorrow..  there's a mary moo cow special on the number two i have to watch.  it'll probably be over by then.  you heard the weatherman.  dr. jake's predictions weren't exactly accurate when we had that blizzard.  i better go get some supplies.  mr. read: see, kids. isn't this fun.  a candlelit dinner.  d.w.: cold leftover pasta, applesauce, and pretzels.  that's it..  the store was closed so we have to make do with this.  but...  we do have all that leftover strawberry ice cream for dessert.  make that strawberry soup.   anybody want it as a first course.  i'm so hot.  my ears are sweating.  can't we at least turn on a fan.  fans are electric.  here, we'll just open a window and get a nice breeze.  there goes the candlelit part of dinner.  well, at least it's cooler.    pretzels and tap water.  it's like we're in jail.    buster: hey, arthur.  hello.  hey, buster.  is your power out, too.  yeah, but i have a little bit of light.  something's glowing in my food cabinet.  i hope this blackout ends soon.  i can't sleep in this heat.  me neither.  i tried counting sheep, but imagining all that wool just made me hotter.   i think my battery's dying.  don't worry, arthur.  i'll find some way to contact you tomorrow.  i'm a few blocks away.  you don't need electricity to walk.   you're fading.  hang in there, buddy.  we'll get through this.    something's cooking.  arthur: hey, is the blackout over..  no.  and here's your share of the milk.  it's less because you took too many ice cubes yesterday.  oh.  i thought i smelled someone frying something.   i think our minds are playing tricks on us.   vicita: hello.  anyone home.  good morning, mr. read.  my father wanted to know if you wanted to come over for breakfast.  we're having arepas.   these arepas are delicious.  do i taste a hint of cilantro in the ah.  exactamente.  it was my mother's recipe.  how come this orange juice is cold.  because it was in our natural refrigerator.  show him, alberto.  when it starts to get hot, my dad buries a metal pail in a shady spot.  since the temperature is lower underground, the drinks stay cooler.  there are many blackouts in ecuador, so you learn a few tricks.  ah, they're not just tricks, mi amor.  you have to be prepared.  would you like to see the basement.  i have lots of extra batteries, but if i run out, this lantern is very handy.  arthur: cool.  what's this.  a handcrank radio.  no batteries required, just muscle.  dr. jake: still no power, but they expect to resolve the problem very soon.  till then, keep it tuned to welp and chill out with dr. jake.   dr. jake, some doctor.  all his predictions are wrong.  do you have a handcrank tv, too.  i have to watch mary moo cow.  sorry, d.w.  but it's nice to take a break from tv, don't you think.  mr. read: my catering job's been canceled.  mom can't work, so let's all do something together.  okay. like what. i'm thinking.  we're not prepared.  this air conditioner doesn't even have a crank on it.  and i'm probably missing mary moo cow right now.  d.w., there are other ways to have fun.  remember what a good time we had during the blizzard.  that was different.  there was snow, and snow is fun.  she's right.  even rain would be more fun than this heat.  rain.  that's it.  we all need to get wet.  arthur: are we both going to fit in that.  sure.  it'll be cozy but cool.  hope no one sees me in this thing.   buster: hey, arthur.   i came over to see how you guys were doing.  ooh, nicelooking bath.  can i join you.  um, okay.  d.w., could you move over a little.  but nadine's sitting here.  well, tell her to move over.  : ah...  this is great.  i can almost imagine i'm at the beach.  aah. i feel an octopus.  that's just my foot.   come on, boy.  you can come in, too.  why don't you just invite the whole neighborhood.   pal. now, stop that.     hey. what's happening.  we're sinking.  abandoned ship.   ooh, you have to watch out for dogfish.  i will show you a way to cool down that doesn't need so much water.  this is what myabuela used to do whenever she was hot.  here, put your feet in.  both :..  and if you keep the curtains closed, the house will stay cooler.  thanks again, ramon.  do you like blackouts, mr. molina.  'cause you're really good at them.  : no, d.w.  i, too, miss not having electricity.  but when i was growing up in quito, my family always used blackouts as an excuse to have a fiesta.   people would all share their leftovers, there would be music and dancing, and everyone on the block would party into the night.  so there were some good parts to the blackouts as well.  that's a great idea.  let's have a fiesta.  i'd love to, d.w., but i am afraid we don't have enough food.  i could bring over all the things from my food case.  i don't think that's such a good idea.  but what about some stuff from your garden.   and i have the perfect main course.    here, mr. molina.  some more organic tomatoes.  perfecto.  david, you start working on the salsa.  i am going to get some lanterns.  it's all in the wrist.  like this.  excelente.  now try it out.  five cents, please.  it's good to have a lot of change at these blackout fiestas.  dr. jack : well, it looks like the power will be out for another day at least, and... uh...  wait, iit... it's back on.  woohoo.  aw. that's it.  it's over.  well, at least you'll be able to watch mary moo cow again.  yeah.  but i'd rather have a fiesta.  mm, don't worry. i am prepared for this emergency as well.  now...   we can party all night.  and now...  arthur and his family didn't have any electricity.  so they had no refrigerator.  do you think that a refrigerator is the only way to preserve food.  girl: peter mccarthy is here, and he is a chef.  peter's restaurant is evoo.  peter: at evoo, we do a lot of preserving of food. we can put food in jars and take the air out of the jars, and we don't need a refrigerator.  they're preserved and last a really, really long time.  today we're going to make strawberry jam and pickled apples.   apples.  ooh... cool.  there you go.  peter: the flavoring for the pickles is called the brine.  the brine helps preserve the apples.  water, honey, sugar, vinegar, spices.  some cinnamon, star anise pods, some ginger.  oh, i still have to add the lemon.  our next step is putting them into a hot water bath to seal the jars.  are you guys ready to make some strawberry jam.  kids: yeah. okay.  first thing we need to do is smash these strawberries.  smoosh. smoosh.     there's only two ingredients: strawberries and sugar.  oh.  oh.  boy: the sugar went into the table.  peter: and it's going to cook until it's really boiling, boiling hot.  boy: the strawberries everything in here are cooking.  is really hot right now. when they cool down, the air that's in here is going to pop out and seal the jar.  it'll be preserved.  we'll see how everything came out next week.  girl: they've been in the classroom for one week, and they're not in the refrigerator.  they're delicious.  good response.     mmm.  that's good.  and now...   hello.  pal and i have a very important announcement.  mei lin, binky's baby sister, will be hosting the show.  it's her first time, so please give her a warm welcome.       sorry, forgot to turn the baby translator on.  and although i am the host, i do not agree with all this show's views.  for instance, very few of the characters are babies.  only 16% of the episodes are about people under four.  there are even more shows about pets than babies.  and what'sthat supposed to mean.  i think she's just cranky.  we must have woken her up from a nap.  oh. so every time a baby disagrees with something, it's because she didn't get her nap.  mei lin, i didn't say that.  you're becoming one ofthem.  i saw you walking on two legs the other day.  i call it "antibaby." that's absurd.  i'm sorry, but due to, um, technical difficulties, this tease will have to be cut short.   enjoy the show.  kate: oh, grow up.   your move. that's it, mei lin.  you can do it.  put some barnes muscle into it.   that's the fifth time this week she almost stood on her own.  how will she ever walk if she can't even stand.  she's just not ready.  kate only started a month ago, and look at her now.  it's like you're falling, but then you stop yourself just in time.  very impressive.  these glasses are amazing.  i can see my toenails.  come on, mei lin. just try it once.  but i don't want to stand.  i like being on all fours. it's safer.  pal: and you also find more leftovers, like this hairy cookie.   mmm. woolly.  oh. i've had this blasted itch all day.  kate, would you see what it is.  alto, sale.  piu alto.  it's pepe.  si.it is me, pepe.  and look who's with me.  my brother, sale.   pepe. oh, i should've recognized that itch.  what are you doing here.  shouldn't you be at the flea circus.  oh, bugs. kate, squish them.  no, no, mei lin.  these fleas are our friends.  yes. pepe tells the most amazing stories.  tell us one, won't you.  once there was a flea who couldn't find his brother.  we've heard that one.  oh. okay, uh...  let me think.  how about the "three little bugs".  one bug had a house of straw.  another bug a house of wood... that's just "the three little pigs," but with bugs.  if you're not going to squish them, i'll get binky to.   wait, wait, story is coming to me.  perfecto, sale.   once there was a kingdom where no one walked on two legs.  everyone crawled.  it's a good beginning.  okay, i'm listening.  this was a long time ago in a faraway land called hanzanniis.  the king of hanzanniis had a daughter named princess lemini who is very beautiful, but very lazy.  meno, i'm hungry.  bring me a grape.  right away, princess.  it wouldn't be so bad if she didn't make me peel them.  where is lap.  i want to be amused.  that matted wad of stinking fur.  he's probably rolling in the trash some...  lap is here to bring good cheer.  lap was the princess' jester.  she loved him more than anyone in the entire kingdom.  what'll it be: knockknock joke, a magic trick, or shall i just lick your feet.  oh, do that thing that you do, you know, with your back legs.  since everyone in the kingdom crawled, walking on two legs was just about the strangest, silliest thing anyone could do.   oh, that's priceless.  give him a treat, meno.  incidentally, this is how dogs learn to beg.  fascinating.  the princess' servant was jealous of all the attention lap got, so he secretly had a witch put a spell on the treat.   the scoundrel.  right away, dear princess.  here you go, wretched cur.  enjoy.  lap.  what's wrong.   hmm, must have gotten a chill.  oh, well, he'll make an interesting lawn ornament.  no, don't touch him.  there must be some cure for this strange disease.  but no one in the entire kingdom could hear her beloved jester.  so princess lemini set out on her own to find a cure.  the princess crawled across the hot sand for days, without seeing a soul.  oh. ow. oh.   a baby.  what's a baby doing in the middle of the desert.  i'm on a quest to help my friend lap.  he's frozen.  do you know someone who could cure him.  like a doctor.  i could take you to mine.  she's fabulous.  hop on.  oh, stop.  couldn't you just carry me.  with what, these teeth.  it's the hump or nothing.  so the princess held on.  and, after a while, she got used to riding a camel.  whee. faster, faster.  hey, this is my speed limit.  you want faster. ride a cheetah.  there, now get plenty of rest and stay off of that claw.  camel, how are you.  ah, i can't complain.  it's her that needs help.  the wise dr. baba kety listened to the princess' story.  it sounds like your friend is under an evil spell.  oh, no. poor lap.  can you fix him.  i'm afraid not.  but there's a tree whose fruit can undo any spell.  it's on an island in the middle of the sea.  you swim, right.  only in heated pools.  you could borrow my sailboat.  good luck.  camel: call me when you get there, and let me know you're safe.  the princess loved sailing, mainly because the wind did most of the work.  but then, a sea giant rose up before her.  with one swipe of his mighty hand, the giant tore the sail from the boat.   i wonder what these are for.  maybe i can use them to get away.  arrgh.  she had neverrowed a boat before, but when a giant is chasingyou, you learn quickly.  the princess rowed and rowed and rowed.  eventually, she reached the island with the magical tree.  oh.  whew.  baba kety had neglected to tell the princess that the tree was at the top of a mountain.  oh, come on.  it took her all night to climb the mountain.  many times she wanted to quit, but then she would think of poor lap...  he makes an excellent scratching post.  ...and she would find the strength to carry on.  oh.  ow. oh.  by morning, she had reached the tree.   she crawled out onto the branch, and there it was, the fruit that could undo all evil spells.  she grabbed it...  then the branch broke.    the... end.  what. that's terrible.  stinky.   wait, wait, i forgot something.  a bird caught her before she hit the ground and flew her back to the kingdom.  now there was only one thing left to do: give lap the magic fruit.  but how would she put it in his mouth.  he was too high up.   there was only one solution: she had to stand.  she thought it would be hard but her arms and legs were very strong from all the rowing and climbing.  mmm. juicy.  lap, you're back.  did i go somewhere.  princess, you're standing.   it looks even sillier when you do it.  the princess did feel a little strange, but she decided she liked being on her own two feet.  after that, she taught everyone in the kingdom how to stand and walk.  except for that dastardly cat meno.  the end.  that was beautiful.  didn't you think so, mei lin.  yes, but what's the moral.  not to trust cats.  whatever happened to that meno character, anyway.  pepe.   they're gone.  but i wanted to ask him about...  come on, mei lin.  time to go.  and then uncle slam says: "grr, i'll get you, tiny tornado." good night, mei lin.  sleep tight.  oops, forgot uncle slam.   you...  you did it.  you're standing.  mom, get the camera.   it's always
