 hey.  whoa.   sooner or later, we're all afraid of something...  like heights...   or big spiders.   but you know who's never afraid.  sue ellen.  nothing scares her.  not oral reports...  if nobody volunteers to go first i'll have to pick one of you myself.  i volunteer, mr. ratburn.  not the daily special at the cafeteria.  yuck. yuck.   not even scary movies.   and after what happened in the woods she's still not easy to scare.  : what about you, arthur.   binky: and they hear it again: "screek, screek, screek." and, man, are they scared.  so they start the car and, zoom, they drive off.  and then.  and then when they get home they find out what was making that screeky noise.  there, stuck to the car door handle is...  yeah. yeah.  a big, sharp... book.   wait.  i've heard this story before.  it should be a hook stuck to the door, not a book.  i know, but where was i supposed to find a hook.  that was still scary, binky.  weren't you scared, sue ellen.  why. it's just a silly, madeup story.  it didn't really happen.  we know it's makebelieve.  we do.  that's what makes it fun.  fun is traveling, sightseeing going new places.  real things are fun.  boo.   wow, is she tough.       binky, buster, arthur.  if you're trying to scare me, it's not going to...   work.           have fun at school today, sue ellen.  : yeah, lots of fun.  this is silly.  there are no such things as monsters.  not here.      maybe it's something that followed us from someplace else.  someplace overseas.  like the baba yagathe scary ogre lady from the russian backwoods.  : there she is.  lunch.  baba yaga: i don't like chasing my meals, little one.      don't be late for school.    what's gotten into me.      binky, don't do that.  so youcan get spooked.   hey, we finished the scary scarecrow.  want to see him.  : um... no.  we'll be late for school.  no, we won't.  we'll take the shortcut through the dead woods.  , thanks.  maybe later.  no, reallyshe was scared.  sue ellen scared.  of what.  uh... a mummy.  nah, mummies are too slow.  she could outrun one.  not if the mummy had a mountain bike.  nothing on earth scares sue ellen.  so... it's not from earth.  at last, someone's seen a real alien.  it's not aliens.  it's worse.   binky: an old lady in a house that walks like a chicken.  what's scary about that.  couldn't you just catch it and barbecue it.   stop it.  this is real.  why.  because it's one of your stories and not ours.  did you ever see a baba yaga in russia.  has buster ever seen a space creature.  well, no, but...  so does that mean they're not real.  it still doesn't prove it was a baba yaga.  i know.  it could've been something else.   buster: the creek's always noisy this time of year.  it's just water.  or it could have been a kappa.  what's a kappa.  a hungry river demon from japan.  the only way to defeat it is to make it bow.   look, a five dollar bill.  darn. i'm stuck.  what kind of demon are you.  you got to work on your defense, kid.  i'll do better next time.  hey, the next guy might have a sword.  remember what happened to larry.  that's how i'd handle him.   okay, go ahead.   maybe you heard a bird.   or a banshee, from ireland.  her wail foretells doom for anyone she visits.  huh.    hey, that hurt.  huh, what's so hard about that.   uh, i think that was my mom calling me so i'd better be going.   it was right around here.    thatwhat is it.  an inintergalactic crcrcreature of some kind.   or a chipmunk.  what do you think, arthur.  i think... i want to leave.  go away.  you don't scare me.  hah.  i showed that old monster.   any ideas, sue ellen.  yeah... run.  arthur: wait.  what are we afraid of.  we didn't see anything.  no, just a...   binky : it's just the tree house.  we can't go on like this.  we're scared of everything.  well, we were okay until you told us all those stories.  but they're just stories.  no, you heard that thing.  it's real.  but there must be a logical explanation for this.   rrright.  when you find out, let me know.   father: sue ellenwe're reliving our swiss alps trip.  remember how afraid we were to climb our first mountain.  so how did you get over your fear.  father: once we prepared with equipment we could face our fear head on.    i wasn't scared.  i mean, hello.  sue ellen: binky, i'm going back.  back. why.  we'll never be able to use the shortcut again if we don't face that thing.  we just need to be prepared and have the right equipment.  oh, man.    : let's go.  uh, why not.  rememberwhatever happens, don't scream.  agreed.  one for all...  and good for nothing.  come out, come out whatever you are.     hey, that's me.  arthur: sorry.  oh.  oops.   oh...  hey, you guys.   it's perkymrs. wood's mean old dog.  perky.  that's what scared us.  a dog.  imagine that.    oh, my precious perky.  i was worried sick over you.  arthur, you've saved my perky again.  we all did.  why, she'd still be trapped if you had let her cry frighten you away.  aren't you a brave group.  i shall give you all a big kiss.     then we heard it again: "scritch, scritch." it was coming from the dead woods.  i saw its beady, glowing eyes.  then from inside the ghost tree it sprang.  : what. what.  a hideous, twoheaded wolfman.     hey, you said wolfman, not cowman.  i couldn't find a wolf head.  wow. i didn't think you liked scary stories.  yeah, how'd you think up something so cool.  kids: and now...  sound can fool you sometimes.        everybody in our class made sound.    one kid will maybe make a sound and the other kid will not be able to see the sound and so they'll try to guess what the sound is.  you get it.   are you playing a drum.  class: no.   boy: sometimes things sound different than what they are.  taking apart those packing materials.  class: no.  i have to admit but i think it's the garbage can going up and down.  class: yes.  taking tape out... of the thing.  class : yes.     pulling the cap off the glue stick.  oh...   two knives.  no.  is it any kind of silverware.  class: no.  sound is a vibration.   ...vibration that sends waves through the air.  then it would bounce against your eardrum and your eardrum would vibrate and then you would hear a sound.  your ears can trick you.   is it sliding a box around.  class: no.  scissors.  class: yes.  sound is very mysterious.   kids: and now...  narrator: the mummy of the egyptian ruler was surrounded by his finest treasures.  if i was a mummy i know exactly which of my treasures i'd want.  nah...   ick.  nope.  yes.  that's it.  some treasures.  i'd haverealtreasures.   all the paper from my christmas and birthday gifts my favorite stuffed animals my acorn collection, my button collection.  i had a snowball, but somehow it disappeared.   that won't even happen for another 3,448 years.  i am now mummyready.   if we walk out quietly, we won't have to ask.  good idea.    you have so much cool stuff, grandma.  but my most favorite thing is this.  you mean clarissa.  i've had her since i was your age.   ere's ur mother.  we'd better get you ready to go.  goodbye, clarissa.  maybe clarissa would like a vacation from that musty old cabinet.  how would you like to take care of her for a week, d.w..  oh, thank you, grandma.  i know you'll treat clarissa like the treasure she is.  now, you two have fun.  ratburn: rapunzel, rapunzel let down your hair.    there will now be a brief intermission. )
