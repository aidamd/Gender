 . hey. what a wonderful kind of day. .  hey.  arthur: hey, d.w.  hey.  whoa.   francine's done some goofy things.  once she tried to break the world's handwalking record.  francine: arthur, over here.  i'm open.  arthur: once she decided the best time to practice was on the roof at sunrise.   woman: the building's collapsing.  man: no, it's somebody playing drums.   that only lasted one day.  one time she decided to make a lifesized painting of an elephant in her bedroom.  francine.  not bad.  accurate proportions.  that's not the weirdest thing she's done.  last week, francine did something that nobody could believe.   aah.  hey.  i'm onyourteam.  yes.  cheer up, we're doing great.  who's "we".  nobody but you gets to play.  binky's team is tough.  here's the puck if you want to lose.  you're so rude, francine frensky.  i guess the truth hurts.  muffy, shoot.  no, pass it to me.  yeah.   we lost.  i hope you're happy.  how is itmyfault.  why did you tell muffy to shoot.  you know she's the worst player.  we're just lucky there's a game next week.  where'd muffy go.  wait up.  are you mad.  maybe i'd play better if you gave me the chance to play.  you take the fun out of everything.  you're like a walking poke in the eye.  i'm one of the nicest people around.  if you don't know that, you're a dope.  i am, am i.  i'll bet you this princess peach watch that you've always liked that you couldn't be nice for one entire week.  i bet i can.  okay, then.  you have to be pleasant for one entire week, francine and you can't tell anyone why.  why would i.  they won't even notice a difference.   where did you get that weird sweater.  my aunt bonnie.  my other one's dirty so i got stuck wearing it.   buster: uhoh.  watch out.  here comes francine.  you're never going to hear the end of it.  um, arthur, that sweater...   um...   what about it.  it's nice.  whew.   francine: two men in scoring position.  who's up.  i am.  let me bat for you...  unless you'd rather bat.  you just look a little tired.  feel okay.  yeah, i'm fine.  doyoufeel okay.  yes, thank you for asking.   hey, you have to see this.  arthur: what's she doing.  okay, now you try it.   muffy, can't you do anything...  wrong.  that was near perfect.  weird.  have you noticed something about francine.  yeahshe replaced my football that she threw down the sewer.  that's nothing.  she replaced a glass of juice she drank last summer.  my good pants.  sorry.  am i still invited over for dinner.   yes.  she ripped my good pants.  are you as impressed as i am by the durability of brick.  i'll be over at 5:30.  there are three days three hours and 32 minutes left in the bet.  want to call it off.  no, just take good care of my watch.    father...  let me help you.  what.  who said that.  you have a guest and you wear ripped pants.  yeah.  well, your clothes... are great.  could you take me shopping sometime.  finally you have taste.  we'll go on saturday.   arthur: francine's friendly, helpful, pleasant...  arthur, i'm scared.  we all are, buster.  what are you doing.  this behavior is no good for francine.  allow me to demonstrate.  if someone like her holds it in the pressure builds just like in this bottle.  the longer she holds it in the more pressure builds up until she reaches the inevitable point when the pressure is just too much.   we've got to help her before she pops.  how.  by making her lose her temper.    if we miss it it'll drive francine nuts.  yeah, hooray.  we did it.  she's going to scream.  the sun was in your eyes.  we bought you a soda.  here.  this is cherry.  you know i hate cherry.  but perhaps i haven't given it enough of a chance.   francine, binky barnes said he could beat you at any sport any day.  he did.  doesn't that make you mad.  don't you want to teach him a lesson.  perhaps he's boasting because he's insecure or he practiced very hard and really can beat me.  we tried.  with all that pressure she's definitely going to pop.  it could happen at any time.  teacher: they soon came upon a griffin.  : a griffin, a griffin, a griffin...   she's going to the next town.  my, but it's a lovely day.  wow.  mommy, some kid's head fell in our yard.  what a beautiful lawn.  arthur: muffy, do you know what's wrong with francine.  we're all worried she might pop.  she'll be back to her normal, pushy self tomorrow afternoon at this time.  you mean...  after the playoff game.  the hockey game.  i didn't consider the hockey game.  why didn't you steal it.  it would have been rude.  oops. excuse me.  arthur: francine.  distract the goalie.  say something about his face.  that might hurt his feelings.  good shot, sue ellen.  i never knew you played so well.  you haven't scored all season, have you.  hmm... no.  take a shot.  francine.  i'm just trying to be nice.  there's only 37 minutes left in the bet.  i declare you the winner.  i can last.  besides, you were right.  everyone plays well if i'm nice.  including the other team.  here's the watch.  now, get mean.  thank you for the watch but i feel it's only right i last the final...  ohh.   muffy.  we've got the old francine back.  and she let someone else score a goal.  so her head won't pop off.  i'm glad you're back.  you were getting quite boring.  me, boring.  what's the matter with you.  if you think i'm boring...  francine...  come on, let's go inform binky he's buying me a new watch.  kids: and now...  "dear francineyou should be nicer to arthur and all the other kids." "dear francineyou need a lesson on how to be nice." "dear francineplease try to be a lot nicer." "you were mean to arthur.  "you need to learn some manners to use when you are with your friends." "francine, you have to let other people play if they are on your team." "when you make fun of arthur you hurt his feelings.  arthur does not like it." to him and his friends." "you should be nice to other people." "help your friends when they are in trouble." "and if you don't learn to be nice no one will want to play with you at all." i'm cassandra.  i'll be francine.  "be nice to your friends.  this is how to be nice." "francine, i like you when you are nice and share your books with your friends." stop making fun of people who wear glasses cause one day you may have to wear glasses.  "don't steal the hockey puck from your teammates.  they will pass the puck when it is your turn." "francine, pass the ball to your teammates and don't make fun of arthur." francine, we love you.  kids: and now...  did you hear.  arthur gleeps stuff.  arthur gleeps reams.  what.   arthur kps beans.  arthur is sweet on francine, man.  break.  . arthur eats fancy spam .  . arthur eats fancy spam. .  did you hear.  arthur gleeps spam.  he's tough.   arthur gleeps stuff.  oops.  most of the time you don't know how stories get started but i know exactly who started this one...  : me.   come on, let's get a seat before we have to sit at...  both: the tough customer table.       uh, hi, binky.  uh... huh. oh, hi.  what are you doing here.  hey, binky, who's your friend.  he looks like a goofus.  i'm not a goofus.  he never skipped a louie.  a what.   i bet he never pulled a fizzer.  i bet he never gleeped anything.   arthur has gleeped more things than all of you combined.  all: huh.  you have.  yeah, i guess so.  you guess so nothing.  you're looking at the world's greatest gleeper.  gee whiz, sorry, i didn't know.  buster, what does "gleep" mean.  i don't know.  whatever it is, it must be pretty tough.  gleep: a slang term meaning purloin, filch, rifle, in short, steal.  steal. steal.  buster: relax, buddy, it's not like you really stole anything.  but what if everybody thinks i did.  how will they know.  binky arthur.  here come the tough customers.  hey, arthur, we want to talk to you at our headquarters.  uh, well, i guess we can take our baseball cards over there.  the rabbit stays.   so, arthur, what you said at lunch...  about how you gleeped a lot of stuff.  more than all of us.  um, uh...  well, see...  we want to make you a tough customer.  inaugurate you into our society.  a tough customerme.  sure, with all you've gleeped you could teach us something.  yeah, is it true you gleeped mr. haney's tie.   uh, to get on with the ceremony.  raise your right hand...  hey, listen to me.   let's split.  recess is over.  ever since lunchtime everyone is treating me completely different.  ah, come on, arthur.  you're probably just imagining things.  oh, excuse me.  it's all i have, arthur.  please don't hurt me.  hey, thanks, uh... sir.   probably just a coincidence.  for my first choice i pick the toughest kid in the whole schoolarthur.  huh.   that's funny.  why'd she pick arthur.  buster: we take binky.  she picked him because he's the biggest gleeper in school.  molly: we take francine.  and he breaks through.  they can't stop him.  francine: arthur...  binky said you were the biggest gleeper.  i almost believed him.  what's so funny about that.  you're just not the gleeping type.  isthatso.  i've gleeped lots of stuff.  i'm a regular gleeping machine.  right, molly.  hmm...  arthur read, if i had...  just to prove you were...  gleeped. why you...  i will never speak to you again.  just goes to show who your real friends are huh, art.  so, arthur, we were wondering you know how you gleeped mr. ratburn's socks.  iheard they were full of holes.  mr. ratburn's socks.  well, actually...  he wouldn't wear no socks full of holes.  he's a very upstanding kind of guy.  hey.     take this, you guy.  what i want to know is how did you get them off while he was wearing them.  that's what impresses me.  actually, molly, i never...  tell anyone your gleeping secrets.  good policy.  i'm glad to see you're having fun with your new friends.  woman: arthur, i didn't know you were interested in meditation.  i was just thinking.  mrs. macgrady, can i ask you a question.  shoot.  if somebody said you did something but you didn't know what it was and it turned out to be something bad but made people think you were cool is it okay not exactly to say you did it but not to say you didn't do it.  i'm sorry, arthur i don't know what you're talking about.  but if you explained it more slowly...  muffy: there he is, arrest him.  and make him give it back.  lock him up and throw away the key.  now, now, muffy, calm down.  what in nirvana is going on.  arthur stole my cellular phone.  what, why would i.  i did not.  did, too.  everybody knows you're the biggest gleeper here.  biggest what.  gleepersomeone who steals.  make him give it back.  torture him until he confesses.  send him up the river for life.  take away his tv privileges.   make him eat... oh.  excuse me.  hello, muffy here.  oh, hi, mommy.  yes, i told mr. haney about my manicure appointment friday.  could i see you in my office.  make yourself comfortable.  i was rather upset when muffy called you the biggest beeper... beeper, yes.  in school.  lollipop.  no, thank you, sir.  now, if we believed everything we heard we'd probably think the world was full of monsters and sea serpents.  people would be afraid to go swimming which would be a shame since swimming is a good form of exercise.  i do it myself.  but bleeping...  that's something serious.  if you have anything to do with it i warn you to stop immediately because you will get caught.  then you'll be in deep trouble.  yes, sir.  did i say that right.  bleeping.  blurping.  gleeping, sir.  gleeping, of course.   run along now, arthur.  so what did he do to you.  well, nothing, he just warned me.  did you tell him where to get off.  you old con artist.  i bet you had him going in circles.  listen, there's something i have to tell you.  i bet you sold out on us.  he told him all about us. )
