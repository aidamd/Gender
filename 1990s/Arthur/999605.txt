 how are you.  never better.  wish i could say the same for bonnie.  she's ailin', doc.  bring her inside.  i tried everything, even rubbing her neck with that lemon oil you said she likes.  but she still sounds terrible.  all right.  let's take a look at the patient.  george: he kept talking to it, like it was a person.  it was pretty weird.  any weirder than talking to a wooden giraffe.  george: that's different.  wally's a dummy.  you're supposed to talk to him.  this was a guitar.  he had a really cool name, toolean domax.  something like that.  dean lomax..  yeah, that was it.  do you know him.  are you kidding.  he's a rock star.  he used to be really big.  now he's just kind of big.  my mom has all his albums.  my grandma loves him, too.  she's always singing that song, "looking for bonnie." bonnie.  that was what he called his guitar.  bonnie is at your house.  george, that guitar is magic.  a long time ago...  dean was walking along a country road when he stopped to rest under a tree.  he was writing the words to "looking for bonnie," but he was stuck on the first line.  dean: "i was...  looking for... love." nah. that's been done.  buster: suddenly, a storm broke out.  whoohoo.  bring it on.  "and who are thou.  said i to the softfalling shower." buster: dean was dancing in the rainhe liked to do that sort of thingwhen a bolt of lightning hit the tree he'd been under.  dean fell back as he saw the most amazing thing.  the lightning left nothing of the tree but a guitar.  bonnie...   and with that guitar, dean finished his song and had his first hit.  the rest is history.  wow. i had no idea.  and just think, that guitar is in your house right now.  i wish i were you, george.  or your dad.  or dean lomax, or some other rock star.  or even just a guitarist.  buster.   hi, george.  i'm here for my sleepover.  sleepover.  see you tomorrow, mom.  what sleepover.  it's friday night. remember.  we had a plan to...  oh, wait.  maybe i was supposed to go to arthur's.   whoo, it's cold.  well, since you're already here...  you asleep.  no. me neither.  let's go see bonnie.  buster, i told you.  dad doesn't like me going into the woodshop without him being there.  but it's a magic guitar.  this might be the only chance in our whole lives to see one.  well... okay.  but i'll need some backup.  and if we get caught, you're taking the rap, longears.  what did it look like.  i had to go before they opened the case.  haven't you seen photos.  no. it's too precious to be photographed.  wally: this place is scary at night.  look at that sawdust.  i wonder if it was anyone i knew.  : wally, keep it down.  we have to be really qui...   that's her.  i know it is.  george: whoa... a guitar made from lightning.  legend has it that one touch can give you magic powers.   whoa.  easy, bonnie.  what is it.  a little tree, trying to survive on its own out here.  i wish i could help you.  you want me to play a song for it, bonnie.  all right, then.    if i could, i'd play this tree to grow    i'd play for all i'm worth    to give it some good earth    yeah, if i could, i'd play this tree to grow...   hey, arthur.  what you doing.  just pushing around this compost.  mind if we give a little of it to him.  he could sure use it.   if i could, i'd play this tree to grow    i'd play until it rained    all over this dusty plain    yeah, if i could i'd play this tree to grow...   george: hey, prunella, are you here to make it rain.  um, no.  i'm just a fortuneteller, not a rainmaker.  george & arthur: oh...  but i do have some water, if you're thirsty.  sure is dry out here.  give it to him.  he needs it more than we do.    if i could, i'd play this tree to grow    i'd give it company    'cause that's what it needs to be a tree    yeah, if i could, i'd play this tree to grow    and it might take years to do    but i know it will come true    yeah, together we will make this tree grow...   all :  yeah, together we will make this tree grow.   buster: george, are you okay.  i was in this really dusty place and bonnie made this little plant grow into a huge tree.  see. i told you she was magic.  okay, my turn.   francine: this is a terrible place for a concert.  no one's here.  not yet, but once we start playing, this place is going to be packed.  right, bonnie.  okay, everyone, from the top.   one, two... aone, two, three.   people all over the world, come and hear our song    yeah, people all over the world, come and sing along    oh, people all over, people all over    people all over...    what's that.  arthur: it's headed right for us.   aliens from outer space, land, but not me    yeah, aliens from outer space...             yeeha.   yertzel.  snik blakkoo.   snik.  let me guess: that's your mom, and you're late for dinner.  buster.  bus...ter.  wow.  that yertzel played a mean thingamajig.   it's almost morning.  we should get back to my room.  hey, what about me.  don't i get to take a spin on the magic guitar.    i forgot.  this door locks from the other side.  what do we do.  she's as good as new, dean.  i had to realign the fret board and put some...  what are you two doing in here.  huh.  dad.  i can explain everything.  all we wanted to do is see bonnie, and...  you're dean lomax.  so they tell me.  if you two wanted to meet my old lady, you were lookin' in the wrong place.  that's bonnie.  that guitar doesn't look like it was made by lightning.  don't believe everything you hear, son.  that's just a legend.  i bought it in chicago in 1963 for 40 bucks.  but... she is magic, right.   bonnie's just wood, metal and nylon.  but music... now, that's a different story.   it can inspire you to do almost anything.  like get to know a completely different culture.   or make this planet a better place to live.  george:  yeah, together we will make this tree grow   all:  yeah, together we will make this tree grow.   so, i guess you could say that music is a type of magic.   i found magic in the music    dug deep down to the core    there i found my bonnie    we'll be together evermore.   see you, lundy.  we're much obliged.  bye, dean.  come again.  why didn't you introduce me to bonnie.  she and i have a lot in common.  george: like what.  wally: we're both in the entertainment business.  she's strings and wood, i'm strings and wood.  we were made for each other.   and now...  zoe: dean lomax played a guitar named bonnie, but i don't play the guitar, i play a mandolin.   it is an instrument like a guitar, except it has double strings.   my home's across the blue ridge mountains    my home's across the blue ridge mountains.    sometimes i play with my dad.   my home's across the blue ridge mountains    and i never expect to see you anymore.     nice.  this is vick.  he's my mandolin teacher.  play me one of the songs that you've been working on.   zoe: whatever kind of music you like, learn how to play an instrument, and then when you get really good, you can play the songs that you've always wanted to play.  you got that rolling right along.   zoe: we're going to have a bluegrass jam with some of my friends.  we have julia on the cello, katherine on the fiddle, marjo on the dobro and james on the guitar.   that was good, yeah.  what shall we play.   "shady grove"does that sound good.  one, two, ready, go.   shady grove, my little love    shady grove, my darlin'    shady grove, my little love    i'm goin' back to harlan.   zoe: well, music can make you happy, it can make you sad, it can sound pretty.  it just soundsgood.   i'm goin' back to harlan.    kids: and now...  narrator: the place, futuropolis.  the year, 2612.  arthur read works as a clerk for federated mutual insurance.   yes, mr. bronson.  the insurance claims will be ready in just a few more minutes.  the signal.  trouble is afoot in futuropolis.  narrator: but when futuropolis is threatened by danger, darkness or disaster, he becomes...  he becomes...   he becomes... supernova.   d.w.: and don't forget his trusty sidekick, starchild.  starchild, leave me alone.  i'm doing this by myself.  but supernova, i'm helping.  arthur: that's sirius, the superdog.   ever wonder how supernova came into existence.  well, stay tuned for "the secret origin of supernova".   thank you, dark bunny.  you've saved our city once again.  how can we ever thank you.  dark bunny.  dark bunny.  where did he go.  announcer:hey, kids, the allstar comic conventionis coming to your town.  go to our web sitefor more information.  let's check it out.  ouch.  defeating bad guys suregives me a workout.  that's why i get an energy boost from new db mitamax energy drink.   aaaahhh.  guaranteed to restore all the energy you lose leaping across the skyscrapers of rabbitopolis.  cool.  dad: arthur, you haven't done your chores.  coming.      dad: arthur.  how can we ever thank you for your heroic service to the family.  arthur.  arthur.   buster: the comics convention is coming to elwood city next week.  come on.  we need to get costumes.  buster: one of us should be dark bunny and the other should be bionic bunny.  arthur: i'll be dark bunny.   in case i need a little energy boost.  buster: so i'm going as bionic bunny, and arthur's going to be dark bunny.  i even got a new db mitamax energy drink.  i'm saving it for later, in case i need a boost of energy.  you know, this socalled energy drink is just junk food.  what.  look at the ingredients.  it's just water, sugar and food coloring.  but dark bunny drinks it.  he wouldn't say something's good for you if it's not.  arthur, he's a character on a tv show.  the people who created him just want to sell you things.  i know, but he lives by a selfimposed code of honor.  sorry, arthur.  the facts don't lie.  i don't even want this anymore.  selling junk food.  what kind of selfimposed code of honor is that.  dark bunny: commence, gentlemen.  male voice: ever since we introduced our new line of socalled "healthy" foodrelated products, profits have skyrocketed.  so has production.  so has our stock price.  excellent.  more money for me.  that's the dark bunny signal.  don't you need to go.  in the middle of a board meeting.  i'm subcontracting all crimefighting operations overseas, so i'll be free to make more money.  excellentmore money for us.  that sounds good.  brilliant, d.b.  i should have known, pal.  i should have known.   no new db mitamax energy drink today, arthur.  i'm done with dark bunny.  but what about the convention.  we were going to go together, in costume.  i'm still going.  there's got to be some other superhero to dre up as.  what about the ones i invented.  like captain pomodoro or cat saver.  thanks, but i think i'd like to find one of my own.  i know just the place to look.  hey there, buster.  hey, freddie k.  can my friend arthur and i look through the big book.  you sure you can handle it.  oh, yeah.  he's a really big comic book fan.
