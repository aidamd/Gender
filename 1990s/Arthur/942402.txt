the street    everybody that you meet has an original point of view     and i say hey   hey.   what a wonderful kind of day    if we could learn to work and play    and get along with each other    you got to listen to your heart, listen to the beat    listen to the rhythm, the rhythm of the street    open up your eyes, open up your ears    get together and make things better    by working together    it's a simple message, and it comes from the heart    believe in yourself, for that's the place to start    and i say hey   hey.   what a wonderful kind of day    if we could learn to work and play    and get along with each other   hey.   what a wonderful kind of day   hey.   what a wonderful kind of day   hey.  hey, d.w..  hey.  whoa...   brain: there it is: hurricane sadie.  as big as france and heading towards elwood city.  you actually made this.  the globe came from a kit, and i just layered a flexible touch screen over it.  it wasn't that hard.  why did they name it sadie.  it seems too nice a name for a hurricane.  they should've called it something scary, like nigel.  it has to begin with an s.  they're all named alphabetically by the world meteorological organization.  you sure know a lot about hurricanes.  they're fascinating.  they're the most powerful storms on the planet.  did you know the winds can gust over 200 miles an hour.  i just think they're scary.  we had a couple back in louisiana, and all i can say is: be prepared.  oh, the crosswires are super prepared.  we have a generator, tons of spring waterboth sparkling and stilland three cases of smoked trout.  aren't you going to get sick of eating fish.  probably.  but daddy can't resist a sale.  we're having a hurricane party tonight.  wanna come.  all: no thanks.  suit yourself.  here, muffy, take some ice cream for your party.  if the shop loses power, it'll all just melt.  oh yeah, i forgot.  we're having a party, too.  yeah, so are we.  me, too.  big, big party.    well, that should do it.  oh, i left my weather globe inside.  should we get it.  no, that's all right.  i'll just pick it up tomorrow.  plus, i still have to set up my anemometer to measure the wind speed.  we should've invested in a digital barometer to measure the storm's pressure, but i just really like the way the aneroid ones look.  flip wattles : the strongest winds will just miss downtown elwood city, but the area bordering the river will be hit very hard.  ah.  don't worry, we're safe.  don't worry, we're safe.    ..  ..  woohoo.  we just hit 110 kilometers per hour winds.  brain's dad: dinner.  be right there.  this is amazing.   to spending hurricane sadie all together, except for chipster, who's soaking up the sun at tallahassee tech.   bailey.  i'm on my way, mr. crosswire.   and to being prepared.  uh, wind.  something windy.  gone with the wind.  the wind in the willows.  it's thethree little pigs.  how'd you guess that.  i just started.  i can read minds.   no, you can't.  rufus compson here.  yes, i can.  i can tell what you're thinking right now.  oh, hello, sir.  okay, what.  can you hold on for one moment please.  you're thinking, "that bud compson sure is a strange one." yeah, but i'm usually thinking that, so it's kind of cheating.  the katzenellenbogan river is starting to overflow.  they need the army corps of engineers down there.  i have to report for duty as soon as the winds die down.  how long will you be gone for.  my birthday is this thursday.  will you be back in time.  i don't know, sport, but i'll try my hardest.     bailey, my lights don't...  ah.  alas, we've lost powerer and have had a bit of flooding.  galoshes, miss muffy.  flip wattles : while elwood city avoided a direct hit, many homes by the river have had to be evacuated.  some people even had to leave their pets behind.   can you imagine having to leave your pet behind.  i feel so bad for those people, and their pets.  when i talk to my dad, i'll ask him if he's seen any strays.  they sent the army corps of engineers down there this morning.  i didn't know your dad was in the army.  yeah, the army corps of engineers mainly designs, builds, and fixes stuff.  and his job is really important emergency like this.  wow, that's really cool.  yeah, it is.  except when he has to miss really big events.  like one thanksgiving, and my first school play...  oh.  that is kind of rough.  well, it's only early june, so he probably won't miss any big events this time.  bud: that's not true.  he could miss...  bud compson, mind your own beeswax.  okay.  what.  what's he going to miss.  nothing.  theregood as new.   why don't you want arthur to know it's your birthday.  i don't want him feeling sorry for me.  in fact, if dad's away, i think i'll just skip my birthday this year.  you can't do that.  how will you get older.  i'm still going to turn nine, turnip head.  i just won't celebrate it.  but... not celebrating your birthday.  it's against the laws of nature.  oh, relax.  it's just a day like any other.  there's a lot worse things than missing a birthday.  okay, thank you.   insurance will cover the damage.  it'll take a while, but we're going to rebuild this.  i don't understand.  we prepared.  we did everything we were supposed to.  hurricanes are unpredictable.  but look at the rest of the street.  not a single other shop was damaged.  what are the chances of that happening.  it is strange.  but sometimes, these things just happen.  hey, look, it's your weatherglobe.  maybe you can fix it.        arthur: i can't stop thinking about that poor dog i saw on tv.  what if that were pal.  i'd be worried sick about him.  i remember how sad i was when i lost pierre.  pierre.  my pet rock.  i had him in the pocket of my bathing suit when i went to the beach last summer.   if only i had taught him how to swim.   hey, you should call the animal shelter.  maybe you could help out in some way.  that's a great idea.  thanks.  do it for pierre.    brain, i just heard about the ice cream shop.  that's so terrible.  how are you feeling.  um... okay.  a little jumpy, but...  did you hear what happened to me.  our house was destroyed.  what..  well, not exactly destroyed, but our first floor got flooded and we have no power.  we have to move to a hotel.  oh, that's terrible, i...  i know.  it only has four stars, although there is a jacuzzi in every room, but...  oh, francine.  did you hear what happened to me.  mr. ratburn: all right, settle down.  i know the hurricane has affected us all, but i think it's a good idea if we jump right back into schoolwork.  please open your history books to chapter seven.  um, mr. ratburn.  i seem to have left all of my books at home.  oh.  that's okay, alan.  you can use mine.  cisely: ladonna, is that you.  want to talk to dad.  ladonna: and after you left, we helped the reads clean up their yard, which wasn't so bad.  oh. and keep your eyes peeled for stray pets, okay.  arthur asked me to ask you.  will do.  and how about you, sport.  how're you doing.  okay, i guess.  do you know if you're going to be back for my birthday yet.  well, a lot depends on the weather.  if it rains again, i might have to stay longer to...   dad. dad..    what kind of birthday cake do you want.  mom and i went to a bakery today.  you decide.  me.  i can't decide.  it's notmybirthday.  i don't care.  there was a mistake.  they overbooked, and now they don't have room for us.  oh, how rude.  fine, we'll just take our business elsewhere.  well, there's the rub, muffin.  i called other hotels, but they're all full.  the hurricane displaced a lot of people.  so where are we going to stay.   well, it may not be a luxury hotel, but there's plenty of warm beds.  a shelter.  we'restaying in a shelter.  happy birthday.  huh.  but it isn't my birthday.  but your dad might not be around on the day of your birthday.  or the next three.  so we're celebrating them all at once.  that's why there are 30 candles on the cake.  and that's not all.  merry christmas.  but it's only june.  i know, but there's a good chance i might miss this christmas, too.  and before i forget, i got you a car.  but that's for high school graduation.  well, what are you waiting for.  open your pre...   rufus compson here.  oh, hello, sir.  mmhmm, i see.  i'll be there right away.  sorry sport, there's been another emergency.  looks like we'll have to celebrate your graduchrismirthday some other time.   it's not fair.    alan.  are you okay.  i have to put something against the window.  why.  that tree outside.  it could fall into this room any minute.  that's not going to happen.  you can't be sure.  you said it yourself.  sometimes these things just happen.  here, get back into bed.  i'll sit here until you fall asleep.  are we all going to be okay.  yes, i promise.  and in the morning, we'll talk about some ideas that might help you feel better.    i wouldn't eat that cheese.  tastes like glue.  but there are oat 'n' cranberry granola bars on the bottom.  thanks.  i'm muffy.  kaylie lamott, mayor of the shelter.  really.  well, not officially, but i know this place inside and out.  my mom and i were evacuated before hurricane sadie hit.  how on earth do you get any sleep.  it's like a snore factory in here.  earplugs.  and if those don't work, i use earplugsandearmuffs.  that's a great idea.  what.  : i said...   i'm just kidding you.  come on.  i'll show you the best part about this place.  woohoo.  whee.  whoa.   woman:  both: sorry.    greatmore rain.  there goes any chance dad will be back in time.   he's been really jumpy and having trouble sleeping, so our pediatrician suggested we see a therapist.  i think that was a good idea.  i'm fine.  really, you guys don't have to worry about me.  you know what, why don't you let alan and i talk alone for a little bit.  would that be okay with you, alan.  you can call me brain.  everyone else does.  okay, and you can call me dr. paula.  i'm not crazy, you know.  who said anything about being crazy.  please, if a hurricane destroyed my office, i'd be a little jumpy, too.  how do you feel right now.  great.  okay...  a little nervous, i guess.  so tell me, what was it like when you saw the shop after the hurricane.  kind of shocking, right.  yes.  there was this tree sticking out of it, and...  i mean...  we did everything we were supposed to.  and if that could happen to our store, why not our house.  or my school.  i'll never feel safe again.  i think you will.  but things happen in their own time.  is that clock right.  have i really been talking for an hour.  yep.  time flies when you're having fun, huh.  and when you're in therapy.  how are you feeling now.  better.  hey, maybe i'm cured.    listen, it's gonna take a little time to feel safe again.  it doesn't just heal overnight.  but we're going to work on this together, okay.  hey, i called the animal shelter like you said.  they are trying to reunite pets and owners, but they're short on funds, so...  i'm raising money for them.  care to donate.  sure.  here you go.  buster, i'm trying to raise money, not fruit.  what if they rescue a pet monkey.  it could come in handy.   i've only raised three dollars and 35 cents.  that's not going to help much.  arthur, arthur, arthur.  everyone knows you don't sell the pudding, you sell the wiggle.  what does that mean.  you can't just ask for money.  you've got to tell people a heartbreaking story.  "somewhere, there's a poor little kitty, all alone, cold, looking for her mommy." stop.  i can't hear any more.  take my coloring book.   i rest my case.  dw might have a point.  you could make a website that gives people more information.  i could help you.  okay.  bud, i was just making it up.  it's not that.  it's ladonna.  she told mom she doesn't want to have a birthday party because dad's away.  not have a birthday party..  i don't buy it.  even a bad birthday party is better than no party at all.  that's what i say.  you should throw her one anyway.  i will.  we'll have a clown... no, a magician...  no, a clown magician in a tyrannosaurus rex suit..  that's what you'd like.  you have to throw her a party that she'll like.  ask arthur.  he'll know what to do.  ugh, i can't believe i'm still here.  i miss my room, my walkin closet, my whirlpool bathtub...  wait, are you leaving.  great.  now i'll be all alone.  my mom and i are just going to look at our house.  we haven't seen it since the hurricane.  wanna come.  okay.  i'll just let dad know where i'm going.  kaylie, i'm...  i'm so sorry.  i had no idea.  and exhale.   no offense, dr. paula, but i know how to breathe.  i've been doing it for nine years.  : i know.  you seem like an old pro.  i'm teaching you how to breathe when you feel afraid.  i bet you didn't know that sometimes, i sing.  and every time before i perform, i'm a mess.  this fear climbs inside of me and takes over, like a bully inside my head.  focusing on your breath is one way to stand up to the bullying fear.  so the next time the wind blows, you give it a try.    it's not working.  maybe we should just move to the sahara desert.  no trees can fall on you there.  alan, you're the smartest, bravest, most determined person i know.  you're going to beat this.   your chariot awaits, madam.  where's bailey.  oh, he couldn't make it, muffin, because...  he's preparing our welcome back dinner.  we're going home.  woohoo.  oh, i can't wait to see my room, my bed, my flatscreen hd...  what's wrong, cream puff.  nothing.  it's just...  can we stop off somewhere before going home.  you want us to move in with you.  i've got it all figured out.  we have a charming guest suite, or if you don't like that, we can put you in the carriage house, or...  muffy, that'seally nice of you, but we can't.  we're going to stay at my uncle's in florida while our house gets rebuilt.  but i appreciate the offer.  hey, do you think we could ever be, like, you know...  friends.  are you kidding.  after what we've been through.  ladonna: dear diary: today is my birthday.  but daddy's not here, so it won't be any fun.  cisely: ladonna, hurry up.  you're going to be late for school.  i just want today to be normal, but compsons can't resist the urge to throw a party.  guess i'll just pretend to have a good time.  okay, where is everybody.  gussie and madison left for school already.  i'd wish you a happy birthday, but you told me not to, so i'm respecting your wishes.  good.  normally, i don't like to take class time for such things, but i must wish one of our students...  here it comes.  a big congratulations.  arthur read has built a very helpful website.  arthur.  "help after sadie" is a site dedicated to reuniting pets and owners who were separated by the hurricane.  my mom and i found some of their stories online.  they're really moving.  woman : he looks tough, but winston's just a big softie.  we last saw her about 7:00, after her dinner.  jack is...  well, he's my best friend.  all the money goes to the animal shelter, so please give what you can.   rats.  what're you doing with all that.  oh, the tree house was damaged by the storm.  i'm going to fix it.  yep, got everything i need right here.  you're going to use glue.  yeah, why.  should i use something else.  i've got some gum.  come on, we have to pick up some tools first.  you'll help me.  sure, why not.  it's not like i've got anything better to do.  where's the damage.  it looks fine to me.  you're right.  that's so weird.  what a....  all: surprise.  i knew it.  i knew you were planning something.  but how did you guys know it was my birthday.  i didn't say anything.  i told 'em.  i knew you wanted a party even if you said you didn't.  told you i could read minds.  but there is something i don't think you were expecting.  i can't stay too long, but...  you made it.  hey, where's brain.  he said he was going to be here.     i'm smarter than you, i'm stronger than you, and i'm braver than you.  you are not going to boss me around.   best. present. ever.   sadie, no.  ice cream is for people.  now that we've adopted a dog, i think we need to adopt a dog trainer.  since your website's doing so well, i think you should consider charging a fee to visit it.  muffy, it's a charity.  okay, what number am i thinking of now.  infinity.  that's not a real number.   but you were right anyway.  one hurricane sadie smoothie, on the house.  thanks.  i love anything that's sweet.  andfrozen.  so brain, you're finally back in the shop.  how do you feel.  thirsty.  and now a word from us kids.  hi, i'm melina, and we're at the massachusetts emergency management agency.  we're looking for christine and peter.  they help people all around the state prepare for emergencies, like hurricanes and blizzards.  hi, welcome to mema.  we're the massachusetts emergency management agency.  hey guys, you want me to show you around.  yes.  okay, let's go.  this room is our communications center.  this is where we'll watch the weather.  you'll see there are radars up that we're looking at.  we always have somebody here in this room 24 hours a day, seven days a week, not that emergencies happen all the time, but if they do, we want someone here to be ready to let us know something's happening.  okay guys, this computer here has the emergency alert system.  have you ever heard that noise anywhere before.  yeah.   "hello, there's going to be a flood," or something.  that's very good, and that's the sound that we send out in case there ever is a real emergency, and it comes out of this machine.  if there is an emergency, what happens in this room is the governor will come in here and meet with the media.  any of you guys want to have a chance to stand up there at the podium, just like the governor.  you over there.   one thing kids can do is put together an emergency kit.  christine: an emergency kit should have enough supplies to keep yourself fed and have enough to drink for three days, in case you do not have electricity.  that's mine.   i think we're gonna need a first aid kit.  i have a first aid kit.  i have a flashlight.  i have a radio.  i have some water.  ask a grownup to help you make an emergency kit at home.  and now, back to arthur.  whicharthurcharacter are you.  i'm a buster because i'm always hungry.  when's lunch.   i like hamburgers...  ew.  fries...  yes.  pizza...  i call the first slice.  broccoli...  and sandwiches.   he always is hungry.  buster: see. my own sandwich.  it's called the buster.   all: whicharthurcharacter are you.  both: tada.  announcer: pbs kids wants you to get your ..   with the wild kratts.  kratts: activate dragonfly power.  announcer: watch "wild kratts"every weekday on pbs kids or anytimeon the pbs kids video app.  funding forarthuris provided by: the best time to play is anytime.  chuck e. cheese's isa proud sponsor of pbs kids.  and by contributionsto your pbs station from: buster:to watch morearthur and play games with allthe elwood city friends, visit pbskids.org.  you can findarthurbooksand lots of other books too at your local library.  captioned bymedia access group at wgbh access.wgbh.org ..  peg: coming to you live from the tree for the peg + cat network.  they might look like your everyday, runofthemill ukuleleplaying girl and her talking pet cat cat: i'm a cat.  ..  neither are their amazingly amazing mathabilities.  peg: you shapeshifting genius.  pentagirls: huh.  peg: you're making a pentagon with your tail.  whenever there's counting to bedone, count on peg + cat.  weekdays on pbs kids.  or anytime on thepbs kids video app. )
