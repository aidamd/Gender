"dear private baxter," he calls me that sometimes.  "i'll tell you a secret.  "i never liked camp much, at least not until the summer of 1932."  fritz: we were playing capture the flag, and it was shorts versus pants.  get him. get him.  i see him. he's over there.  most of our boys had been captured, and the pants team wasclosing in.  we knew where their flag was, but the hill was heavily fortified and we could only spare one player.  i volunteered for the mission.    i was no match for the guard on duty, so i had to use my wits... and a sock.   we give up. you win.  getting the flag turned out to be the easy part.  now i had to bring it back to our side.  there he is. get him. get him.  i can see him.   get him. get him.   lucky for me, i was a pretty good swimmer, and could hold my breath for one whole minute.  against incredible odds, team shorts won that day and i got a new name.  "fearless fritz." that's just the first letter.  fritz sent him three more.  in one, he's in alaska and he comes facetoface with a huge...  sanjeev, you're giving away the best part.  oops. sorry.  is it too burnt.  i kept turning it like you said.  hmm, not bad.  next time, try a different stick.  that one was... a little piney.   did you get another letter from fritz.  nope, but he did send me... this.  irwin: tomatoes..  i thought it was going to be treasure.  are you kidding.  this is treasure.  these are organic heirlooms.   okay, listen up.  we're going to need some other ingredients.  basil...  olive oil...  salt...  irwin, quickmy brow.  it is done.  i have created...

"the enemy is taking me back to his camp.  "but actually he's not such a bad enemy.  "and his dad makes great brownies.  "see you soon.  love, private baxter." that kid's got quite an imagination.  i'll say.  and he's also one heck of a gardener.   kids:and now...  this place is called farm school.  girl: and it's a farm.  boy: it is a farm.  you see pigs, cows, chickens...  girl: a farm that teaches you stuff about farms.  it's kind of like a camp, 'cause you sleep here.  this is a bunkhouse. we got bunk beds.  boy: and every day, we eat breakfast first.  and we do chores.  man: camden, ruiz, bianca and xavier, you guys are going to be going to the...  garden. garden. garden.  does anybody know what this vegetable is.  i know. it's celery. what is it.  it looks like celery.  but actually, it's something called a "leek." it's kind of in between onions and garlic.  ooh.  oh. oh.  okay, now, hit it against the ground to make all that dirt fall off.  boy: well, actually, i'm learning about where our food comes from.  we're picking out some corn.  we're shucking the corn off.  all the husk on it is going to come off, and we feed the animals and we take care of the animals.  what we got to do is brush all the hay and dirt off their fur.  these guys are baby cows that are learning to be oxen.  girl: it's a working cow, instead of a milking cow.  we're going to put this on them.  it's called a yoke, and it's what lets them pull stuff.  so each of you take one of these bows.  nice. yeah.  now you got those spacers and that nail.  beautiful.  step up, boys.   go ahead, step.  nice. keep driving them.  whoa.  : nice.   you stopped them.  another thing we're going to be doing is making some poles for a new compost bin.  girl: it's important to learn about a farm, because sometimes people don't know where their food comes from, and they see it comes from a farm.  come to farm school. you can learn a lot of stuff.  kids:and now...   and now...  hey, d.w., watch me pull a rabbit out of my hat.  again.  nothing up my sleeve.  presto.    wrong hat.  uh, let me try again.  but that trick never works.  it will this time.  watch.  and presto.  finally, arthur.  it was getting hot in there.  and now, here's something we hope you'll really like.      i hate rain.  especially at recess.  i win.  want to play checkers again.  you just beat me five times in a row.  no, thanks.  if we had some cards, i could show you a magic trick.  hey, i think i've got a pack.  my grandfather taught me this.  pick a card, any rd.  don't tell me what it is.  now put it back.  is that your card.  yes.  how did you do that..  a macian ner reveals his secrets.  cool. wow.    hey, arthur, know any more card tricks.  well, i can do the one i did yesterday.  buster: . tada. .  whoa.  what's up with the vampire costume.  i'm not a vampire.  i am the great baxterini, master of illusion.  i think you mean, master of "delusion." my mom's friend harry taught me some great tricks.  and he gave me this magic wand.  it's been in his family for generations.  some say it was even used by the great harry houdini.  really.  did houdini perform in china.  because that's where it said this wand was made.  oh, ye of little faith.  pick a card, any card.  show it to everyone.  now put it back.  is this your card.  really.  how about this one.  sorry.  weird.  are you sure you didn't put it in your back pocket.  of course i didn't.  you would have seen me.   wow.   that was awesome. how did he do that.  okay, so we've got the food, invitations, plates, streamers...  don't forget balloons.  we've got them, d.w.  so now we just need to decide on what you want to do for your halfbirthday party.  i know exactly what i want: that unicorn that emily had at her party.  that wasn't a real unicorn.  it was a donkey with a plastic cone strapped to its ad.  you're not supposed to tell me that.  next, you'll say there's no such thing as leprechauns.  i'll call up the unicorn guy tomorrow.  hey, do we have any books about magic.  why don't you try the library.    now i need a volunteer from the audience.  someone big and strong.  how about you, sir.  now tie this in a knot, if you would.  nice and tight.  haney: buster, may i speak to you for a moment.  looks like "the great baxterini" is in trouble.  is it true you've been doing magic tricks.  um... yes.  in fact, i'm in the middle of one right now.  just a second.  tada.   bravo.  you'll be perfect.  the kindergarteners are having a bit of a "magic emergency." a magician was supposed to come to their class, but he can't find his rabbit.  could you step in.  provided you can spare him, mr.. ratburn.  sure.  the rest of you will have a little quiz with our old pal roman...  roman numerals.    )
