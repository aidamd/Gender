called virtualgoose.  there's a giant goose in the center and it spins really fast and then it stops at one of the colored circles and you have to shoot tiny balls into the goose's mouth.  the more balls you get in, the more points you get.  blackbelt44that's sue ellen's game name.  she's playing against someone called suntzu49.  since they're playing over the internet suntzu49 could be anywhere in the worldeven china.     well, it looks like blackbelt44 has done it again.  huh.   yes. i am unbeatable.  i'm the queen of the virtual world.   emily : hi, this is emily...  girl : and mariehelen.  we cannot take your call right now because...  because...  because we are on a "treep"a big, long "treep." so leave your message at ze sound of ze beep.    hi, emily, it's d.w.  i have a new game.  call me.  and what's a "treep".  arthur: mittens to protect my fingerscheck.  swimming goggles to cut down the glare from the screencheck.  what's left of my lucky pencilcheck.  arthur, quickpick a number between one and ten.  seven.  seven. that's right.  you win.  you get to choose what we're going to play.  is it going to be tower of cows or this exciting new game, rocks in a box.  nice try, d.w.  oh, come on.  you'll love this one.  it's got real rocks in a real box.  sorry, d.w., i can't.  it's the virtualgoose championship at muffy's.  i was hoping it wouldn't come to this, arthur but you leave me no choice.  recognize this.  no.  well, you should.  it'syourname written onyournapkin.  remember last week when i gave you my tv time.  man on tv: actually, the bionic bunny...  d.w.: you wanted to watch some show about the man who made bionic bunny.  man on tv: ...studying children and the effects of superheroes on their lives...  all:  we like soup, soup is great    you eat it in a bowl, not on a plate.    please, d.w., let me finish this show.  if you do, i'll play whatever you want for an hour later.  you're playing with your glasses and that means you're fibbing.  no, i'm not.  well, i have to be sure you're not lying.  sign this napkin.  man on tv: and when he goes to work at the television...  well, it's later now and it's time to pay up.  pay up.  aw...  i know. what if i promise to play with you for two whole hours next weekend.  make it three and you've got a deal.   arthur: boythis fourhand451 is really good.  he sure is.  my fingers still hurt from trying to beat him.  maybe he's called fourhand because he's a fourhanded mutant sheep created by an evil scientist.    excellent.  muffy: one thing's for surefourhand451 is going to clobber sue ellen.  we'll just see about that.  out of my way.   it's not possible.  cheer up, sue ellen.  fourhand451 is a genetically enhanced sheep.  you're just a kid.  he was just lucky this time, that's all.  he's been lucky the last eight games in a row.  i think this virtualgoose championship is officially over.  just one more game.    must practice... must practice.  sue ellen's mom: it's late.  are you done with homework.  uh, almost.   yeah, i'm finished.  good night, sue ellen.  good night, mom.  must practice... must practice... must practice...  ratburn: shall i repeat the question, sue ellen.   red. the answer is "red".   no, sue ellen, 22 times 11 is not red.  it's "242." however, if i'd asked what color your cheeks are turning "red" would have been the correct answer.  let's try to stay awake, shall we.  buster: hey, francine.  check out my new exercise.  it's called "earobics".  aone and two. aone and two.     sue ellen: i'm sorry, francine.  i'm just so tired.  i was up all night practicing goose.  it's all because of that fourhand451.  oh, if i had him right here, i'd...  sue ellen, maybe you should take a break for a while.  i think all this virtualgoose is affecting you.  you're right.  okay, that's it.  i'm not going to touch a computer game for one whole week.  thanks, francine.  don't mention it.  emily :..  mariehelen: and mariehelen.  we are not home because we are still on our "treep." and a "treep" is a "trip" with a french accent.  oh...   not so fast.  i want my four hours now.  four..  i only owe you three hours.  oh, no.  you're forgetting the first hour you still owe me.  i have it all here on napkins, see.  but, d.w., it's the virtualgoose championship today.  i thought that was last weekend.  that was the championship of the final playoffs.  this is thereal championship.  sorry, arthur.  a contract is a contract.  cows or rocks.  oh... muffy's going to kill me for this.  : does muffy have an ice cream machine.  if she does, i'll have vanilla with sprinkles and vanilla sauce.  does she have a zoo.  i want to pet a whale.  i think i'll pet the whale first then have vanilla with sprinkles and vanilla sauce.  but if i pet the whale first my hands might smell fishy so first i'll have the vanilla with sprinkles and vanilla sauce and then... oh, wait.  whales are mammals, right.  i wonder if my hands will smell mammally.  green.  press green.  now red.  i said "red," not "yellow".  hey, no backseat goosing.  i can't concentrate.  wow, six days with no goose.  and now it's the championship and you don't seem tempted.  it was hard at first, francine, but now i'm okay.  you just take it one day at a time.  muffy: francine's turn.  oh...  wow.  take that, you mutant.  i am in control.  i am in control.   i'm hereis it my turn yet.    excuse me, where is the petting zoo.  hello. i'm talking here.  is anyone home.  sue ellen: they can't hear you, d.w.  they'll be like that for a couple hours.  well, what are we supposed to do.  go exploring.  both: whee.  top floor, please.   that doesn't sound good.  : vanilla ice cream with sprinkles and vanilla sauce.  heavy on the sauce.  wow.  it must be muffy's old game room.  i guess this'll have to do.  nice whale.  "confuse the goose." i bet virtualgoose.com is based on this dumb kids' game.  i beg your pardon.  this is the real thing.  it takes luck, guts and fast little hands.  it's not just pushing buttons.  are you good at it.  good..  i've had that goose so confused it was quacking.  here, i'll show you a few tricks of the trade.   fortyseven games in a row.  that must be a new world's record in losing.  and we were playing all together.  that's our six hands against his four.  eight hands, buster.   he's better than i thought.  sue ellen: step aside.  let me at the computer.  um, sue ellen, what about your promise.  that was before, francine.  but now i know how to beat fourhand451.  now i know... the "way of the goose." remember, you don't play with these. you play with this.    i can't.  others: what.  a promise is a promise.  even if it's just to myself.  way to go, sue ellen.  what are you so happy about.  mutant sheep will take over the world.  i guess no one will ever beat fourhand451 now.  well, there might be someone...  you want a "wittle" white ice cream, mr.  white whale.  you can't be serious.   eat those dots, goose.   we're saved.  long live twohanded mammals.   computer: goodbye, fourhand 451.  : who is this disasterwarning99.  i don't know, but she's goodreal good.  kids: and now...  we're writing poems.  we're writing on the computer.  girl 1: it's work on the computer.  it's not a game you play.  first you have to write down the poem.  that's the first step.  you have to, like, figure out what words would go with what you're writing about, if you know what i mean.  girl 2: and then we go to the computer room to type it on the computer.  that's the second step.  and step three is to draw a picture for it.  step four is to save it.  saving it is putting it into a file.  i forget how.  girl 1: here's where you save.  you write down what it's called and then you say "save" but if you don't save it the picture or the words or both is gone.  "bees fly through the trees going from flower to flower." i just recorded my sound.  boy: after we're done with the poems, we're going to make a big show.  boy: "hats do not have cats in them.  "they're just a thing "that you put on your head to block the sunshine." girl: "seaweed floats as the water begins to make waves.  girl 1: "bees fly through the trees "going from flower to flower "gathering pollen along the way and taking it to another flower." you can be creative with a computer.   and now...   buster: ah, this is the life: a warm fire, good friends and three pounds of beef jerky.    what was that.  mmmaybe it was a lion.  buster, there are no lions in north america.   except for, of course mmmountain lions.  now, just stay calm, everyone.  i nt to quit the game.  binky, this isn't a game.  this is real.     who ordered the dolce de pescados.  oh, i did.  what's that.  french vanilla and fresh fish.  mmm... you can really taste the cod.  thanks.  sue ellen: hi, guys.  shouldn't you be playing virtualgoose.  i thought the final match of the playoffs to the elimination round of the 19th championship was today.  : it is, but since d.w. started playing goose has gotten boring.  she always wins.  besides, who wants to spend all their time inside playing computer games, anyway.  guess what.  i just downloaded virtualgoose version 5.0.  it's so cool.  5.0, wow.  it must be so good they skipped versions two through four.  i want to play right now.  arthur: let's go.  brain: me, too.  sorry, sue ellen, we're closed.   addicts.  announcer: in a time before time, in a place so remote it has never been seen beforeby upright mammals the virtualgoose laid six eggs.  they were:..  stylish goose...  strong goose...  silly goose...  yuk, yuk, yuk.  smart goose...  and finally, just plain goose.  because of hard times the virtualgoose had to leave her six gifted children and pursue a career in online gaming.  she vowed to return with fame and fortune but before she could an evil wind blew the nest out of the tree.   now these geese must fend for themselves alone in the deep, dark woods.  only one will survive.  choose a goose, pass the trials and see if you can be the best of the nest.  sporty.  stylish.  strong.  silly.  smart.  aw, i guess i have to be just plain goose.   level one.  hmm...  "a".    what..  binky: haven't you finished your research yet.  i've got a game to play.  judging from its size my goose should have been able to fly.  if that's true then why aren't you still in the game.  because it's a dumb game, that's why.  i mean, a shark in a river.  come on.  don't listen to him, binky.  the brain's just upset because he couldn't last one day in the wild.  i could, too.  well, i guess we'll never know, will we.   it's the third trial.  eat the mushrooms.  congratulations.  you have passed on to level four.  but that's ridiculous.  they could have been poisonous.  spoilsport.  arthur: "a real weekend camping in the real woods.  are you up to the challenge." gee, i don't know.  will there be real food.  my dad makes amazing s'mores.  where do i sign..  a camping trip.  puhlease.  no showers.  no beds.  no tv.  huh. no, thanks.  uh, i mean, i'd love to go but i can't because of my fragile health.   you four have a good time.  i know what muffy's trying to do.  she wants to get rid of us so she can become the best of the nest.  imagine what she'll be like if she wins.  first there were six then there was one: muffy crosswire.  nmero uno.  top bird.  the nestinator.  pass the salt, please.  sporty goose wants the salt.  will stylish goose give it to her.  negativo.  salt is only for the best.  head honcho of the honkers.  triple crown of the eiderdown.  commander of the gander.   sorry, brain.  yeah, we'd love to go but it just wouldn't be fair to the rest of the class.  sorry, brain, but i've got a karate tournament this weekend.  yeeah.  : make that a trip to the doctor's.  prunella: camping, huh.  sorry, brain.  it says no traveling on days with the letter "y" in them.  hmm... friday already and still no takers.  this camping trip is a complete dud.  a camping trip.  i so enjoyed camping when i was a boy in the woods, with the awesome beauty of nature.  that'sacer rubrum.  that'sulmus americana.  oh. what's that.  moth pupae.  i'd love to go.  great.   have a good weekend, class.  work on those coppersmelting dioramas.  oh, alan.  i have some wonderful books here i thought we'd take with us.  there's wimple'sa history of elwood city's environs from the pleistocene to the present andtrail mapsvery handy if we get lost.  oh, and this little morsel: 1,001 lowfat recipes for bark.  um, those sound really interesting.  but i bet we could print out that information off the internet.  it'd be easier to carry.  the... internet.  well, you see... ahem, i've never actually...  uh skied the webbing of the information freeway... as it were.  it's as easy as tying your shoes.   )
