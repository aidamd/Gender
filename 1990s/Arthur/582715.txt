 you're also not allergic to pet dander or tree pollen.  if you were, you'd see a red bump in one of these circles.  well, that's a relief.  it'd really stink if i couldn't pet pets or climb trees.  but your blood did test positive for an allergy to peanuts.  oh, my.  binky: mom, relax.  i don't even like peanuts that much.  peanut allergies can be quite serious, binky.  i'm a nurse.  i've seen anaphylaxis before.  who's anna phylaxis.  is she at my school.  anaphylaxis is a reaction you could get if you eat peanuts again.  instead of just a rash, it could be hard to swallow or even breathe.  we don't want that happening.  that's why i want you to read these.  great. more homework.  the more about your allergy, mom, it's just chili.  i know, but it has peanut oil in it, see.  you have to look at the ingredients, binky.  peanuts and peanut products are in all sorts of foods.  okay, okay.  how about trim tim's beef jerky.  read the label.  yuck.  peanuts.  no. something called beef lips.  binky, dinner.  what's this.  it's friday night.  we always order chinese on friday night.  i'm sorry, honey, but a lot of chinese food is cooked with peanut oil.  but i used to be able to eat it.  what about egg rolls.  those are made with eggs, right.  it's better to be safe than sorry.  here, have a chicken cutlet.  you love chicken cutlets.  i don't want a cutlet.  i want an egg roll.  oh, all right, i'll have a cutlet.  mmm, not bad.  much better than the ones they make at school.  that reminds me.  i have to make sure they have a special peanutfree table for you at the cafeteria.   a special table..  i can't even sit with my friends.  that's it.  i'm going to bed.  mrs. macgrady: sorry, binky, that's off limits.  the cook who prepared it once stepped on a peanut.  watch it, sonny.  the guy who flipped that burger, his middle name is peanut.  don't even think about the pie.  the eggs in that meringue were from a chicken that once dreamt of a dancing peanut in a bowler hat.  but i'm hungry.  mrs. macgrady: now, don't you worry.  we've fixed up something special for you at the special table.  that's adam.  he's allergic to formica.  the cafeteria is a tough place for him.   but he can't get enough of our homemade spinach juice.  that's ron and don.  they're allergic to their hands and all utensils, plastic and metal.  and this is where you'll sit.  enjoy your brussels sprouts.  you get them every day for the rest of your life.  no....   good morning.  i have a surprise for you.  is it brussels sprouts.  no.  it's your own cell phone.  this way, you can call me if you feel an allergic reaction.  let's see if it works.   hello.  hi.  can you hear me loud and clear.  well, yeah...  wearein the same room.  oh, right.   okay, bye.  bye.  cool. thanks.  i'm going to go to the candy store.  i'll come with you.  mom, i'm almost ten years old.  i can go to the candy store by myself.  i'll read the labels.  i promise.   binky: i haven't decided yet.  no, i'm not going to get peanut brittle.  i don't even like it.  okay. bye.  jenna: how about gummi slugs.  there are no peanuts in those.  i don't like gummi slugs.  they're too gummy.  and how do you know about...  your allergy.  your mom sent an email to all the parents in class.  she did.  it's no big deal.  my mom did the same thing when we found out i was allergic to milk.  milk, huh.  wow, that's terrible.  milk is in everything.  tell me about itice cream, chocolate, even cheese.  but you get used to it.  there's a really good ice cream made from rice milk.  how'd you find that out.  research.   and the more you know, the less your parents bug you.  cashewsi'm buying cashews.  come on.  i'll show you the allergy section in the library.  this one is really good at explaining how all allergies work.  and it's got lots of pictures.  man : and with bionic bunny out of the way, i, condimentor, will rule the world.   activate the giant seasoner.  bionic bunny: no. not sodium chloride.  anything but that.   jenna...  my throat feels kind of funny.  quick, call your mom.   i feel much better.  that shot dr. kingsbury gave me really worked.  i should never have let you eat those cashews.  what was i thinking.  but i'm not even allergic to cashews.  the ones you bought were probably processed in a factory that handles peanuts, too.  are you okay, mom.  i'm just worried, that's all.  huh.  where am i.   i can't move.  man: that's because you're stuck to my superadhesive grape jelly.  thought you could live without my products, huh, binky barnes.  we'll just see about that.  anna phylaxis, begin phase two.  yes, dr. legume.   : peanut butter.  no. stop.  anything but that.  help.   it's...  both: bionic bunny.  your sandwich days are over, dr. legume.  help.  i suggest you get into wraps.   binky: i don't know what would have happened if that bread had touched me.  i'm allergic to peanuts.  bionic bunny: well, if it's anything like my allergic reaction to sodium chloride, it wouldn't have been pretty.  what is sodium chloride, anyway.  saltone single grain and i lose my super powers.  i also retain water and get grouchy.   someone named jenna is being held captive by the evil lord bovina.  i've got to save her.  remember, binky, you're tougher than this allergy.  let it know who's in charge.  binky's mom: binky.  morning, mom.  i found some peanut stuff we missed when we were cleaning out the cabinets.  i'm just going to take this to the trash.  it's a medicine autoinjector.  if i start feeling sick, one shot of this and i'm aokay.  i keep it right here in my new bionic bunny belt pack.  buster: hey, binky, can i see it.  hold it right there.  you packin' peanuts, long ears.  no.  i haven't had a peanut all day. i swear.  he's clean.   you, sit here.  hi, mom.  yeah, i'm at the special table.  how's the soup..  hey, how did you know.  mom.  what are you doing here.  oh, i was...  in the neighborhood, so i thought i'd drop by and make sure you had everything you needed.  i've got everything under control, mom, really.  i know you do.  it's just that...  what's that.  that's not peanut butter, is it..  it's cream cheese and jelly.  remember.  you made it for me.  : and it's delicious.   a little bit further.  just a few more steps.  okay.  you can open your eyes now.  i found it on the internet.  they cook for people with peanut allergies.  they use special pans and everything.  can we please eat here.  well, it is friday night.  binky: yes.  and i'm having three egg rolls.  kids: and now...  all: kellie's candies.   me and kellie have allergies and we can't eat nuts.  we're just like binky.  man: you guys ready for some fudge.  this is kellie and this is her sister katie and her sister sammy.  and we have their friend, kristen.  kristen: tim is kellie's dad.  he's making fudge.  tim: this fudge is made from the basic ingredients so that we can make sure that it is nut free.  girl: because kellie has a peanut allergy, my mom and dad decided that they would start a candy company.  who wants to lick the spoon.  kristen: the company is named after kellie.  tim: and it's called kellie's candies nutfree confections.  katie: my mom makes the candy and my dad makes the fudge and caramels and stuff.  kellie's mom, martha, makes the candy and it has no nuts.  everybody, this is martha.  hi.  martha: this is my chocolate room and this is where we make all the candies for the kids with peanut and tree nut allergies.  now i'm doing chocolate coins.  and then we can take them out of the molds and get them ready for wrapping.  this is a few of the rejects.  kristen: they're candies that didn't come out exactly perfect.  martha: but they taste perfectly fine.  the rules are, they can't take anything without asking.  my husband, of course, has a problem.  he tends to steal chocolate.  this is where we package all the candy.  it's nice for people with peanut allergies like kellie and kristen to have candy like other kids can, too.  all: kellie's candies.   and now...  mr. ratburn: francinenot bad.  sue ellenexcellent.  muffy, congo is a country, not a dance.   were you feeling all right when you took this test.  you're a tad off your usual mark.   bminus..  are you sure this is correct.  yes, i'm afraid so.  don't take it too hard, alan.  you probably just had an off day.  a bminus isn't so bad.  buster: yeah.  it's in the bs.  i love the bs.  brain: but it's only one grade above a cplus.  i've never gotten a bminus before.  arthur: you'll do better next time.  what if i don't.  what if my brain is deteriorating.  i could get a c next time.  and in less than a year, i could be like... like...  arthur, buster, looka u.f.o..  arthur: it's just a dirigible, brain.  a dirigiwha.  you know, a blimp.  : a big balloon.  i'd hate to see the kid who lost that.  hey, look.  there's still frosting on that cupcake.  this could be the start of something very bad.  before the test.  maybe something threw you off.  it was just a normal sunday.  i got up at 7:45...  a hundred and eleven...  one hundred and twelve...  brain: did 135 situps, had someuice and a bran muffin, finished the crossword in three minut and the word jumble in 57 seconds.  then my mom and i opened up the ice cream shop.  i put some music on, and...   wait.  we had new music.  that was different.  breezy listening.  what is it.  just background music.  my mom thought it might encourage people to buy more ice cream.  we're listening to it right now.  i know that tune from somewhere.  what is it.  hey, maybe it has secret messages in it that are making you dumb.  buster.  there are no secret messages in the music.  no, probably not.  but some people believe that plant growth is affected by different types of music.  who knows. maybe this cd did change me somehow.  there's only one way to find out.  the experiment will consist of two tests.  first, you'll put shapes into the holes in silence, then with this cd on in the background.  meanwhile, i'll record your response times, okay.  when do we get our candy.  when the experiment is over.  tommy: but i'm hungry now.  i won't be able to concentrate if i'm hungry.   okay, okay, you can have some candy now.  ready...  set...  go.  stop. stop.  what are you doing..  i'm putting the shapes in a hole.  isn't that what you wanted.  no, tommy, he meant these holes, like this.   you're doing it wrong, timmy.  use your feet.  there.  more candy, please.   "find better test subjects." so average time for puzzle in silence equals 5.4 seconds.  now for the hard part.  intense exposure tobreezy listening.    wow.  this place is huge.  it's much bigger than the elwood city mall.  that's because it's the swellwood city mall, where everything is bigger and better.  would you like a credit card.  um... sure.  happy shopping.  thanks.  funny, i suddenly feel the need to buy lots and lots of stuff.   welcome to chickin lickin'.  can i take your order.  one extra crispy chickareetos with cool piata sauce, a side of cheddarola fries and a large cola, please.  would you like to megasize that cola for only ten cents more.  it's the combo.   okay.    free wintominto.  no.  is there someplace around here where i could rest but not buy anything.  i feel a little sick.  try the swellwood city library, conveniently located in the east wing of the mall.  brain: finally.  someplace with peace and quiet.   brain: ms. turner, what's going on.  you never allow music to be played in the library.  : oh, it's just a little background music, alan.  nobody minds it.  but how does anybody read books in here.  i can hardly hear myself think.  we don't carry books anymore.  we carry "bookazines"they're like books, but they've had all the difficult parts removed.  and they're for sale.  here, try tolstoy'speace.  it's hysterical.  no, this can't be happening.  arthur, don't you see what's going on.  it's this music.  it's turning us into mindless machines programmed to buy things.  we have to escape.  woman: sorry, sir, but you're going to have to pay for that arthur doll before leaving the store.  arthur "doll"..  : want to pull my cord.  feed me.  cash or credit.  no....    brain: my test results after exposure to the cd were a quarter of a second behind my normal score.  this proves that it's affecting my brain.  a quarter of a second isn't very much.  how many tests did you do.  just one.  that's all i could take.  alan, if you don't like the music, we can change it, but i don't think it caused you to get a bminus.  i don't dislike it.  i mean, it's barely even noticeable.  but it's designed just to make people buy more.  isn't that wrong.  don't we want people to buy more of our ice cream.  well, yeah, i guess.  but we don't want to trick people into buying it, do we.  you're certainly right about that.  okay, how about this.  you can be in charge of the shop's music.  just try to find something that everyone will like.   what are we listening to.  koko taylor.  it's a lot better than breezy listening,isn't it.  wait, wait, here's my favorite part.  :  when you leave this town    don't bother comin' back    'cause i'm tired of that.   why is she tired.  because her boyfriend doesn't treat her right, and she never wants to see him again.  really.  that's awful.  it's just a song.  i know, but could you play a different one.  this one's making me kind of sad.  what would you like to hear.  there's "bills, bills, bills and more bills," "evil," "i cried like a baby"...  they all sound sad.  they're not.  cried like a baby" is pretty upbeat.  it just has a sad title.  here, i'll play it for you.  don't bother.  i sort of lost my appetite.  here.  "music suggestions," huh.  this is what you want.  mutakrude.  it's their latest album, "shin splints." it's not in stores yet, but my friend's cousin knows the exdrummer.  it's going to be huge.    don't worry.  i'll get that.  wait.  i'll give you a free scoop, with sprinkles.  what is that terrible sound.  muffy: "muddy crud".  it's pronounced "mutakrude," money bags.  the umlauts give the "u"s an "ooh" sound.  whatever it is, it's awful.  here, brain, play this.  it's much more appropriate.    listen to that voice.  isn't rodney gilfry dreamy.   hey, you can't do that.  why not.  my suggestion came first.  excuse me, molly, but patrons aren't allowed behind the...  francine: relax, brain.  i heard you were looking for music.  i have something i know everyone will like.   fern:  we see the pretty boys...   oh, not this again.   hey, if you play u stink, then you have to play we stink, too.  yeah.  but you guys never even had a song.  sure, we did.  hit it, buster.  arthur and buster:  oh, our name is we stink    we like to play rock 'n' roll music...    that's not singing, that's screeching.  this is singing.   stop it.  this is an ice cream shop, not a jukebox.  from now on, there'll just be silence.  want to go to the sugar bowl.  wait up, we'll join you.    georgenot bad.  fernexcellent.  muffy, caesar augustus was a roman emperor, not a summer salad.  hey, brain, did you think the history test was hard.  no.  but i know what i got anywaya cplus.  why would you think that.  because i wound up putting that breezy listeningcd back on.  the silence in the shop was getting to me.   don't tell me.  it's a cplus, right.  worse.  is it a c.  a cminus.  did i fail.  oh, no.  i'm never going to make it to fourth grade.  excellent work, alan.  see.  i told you it was just an off day.  well, looks like there's nothing wrong with your brain, brain.  does this mean you'll keep playing that background music.   hey,ig head, when is mutakrude going to play.  that's track eight.  it's right after u stink.  you have two songs to go.  okay, i'll take another cup of chocotaco with strawberry salsa and one of these.  personally, i thinksundae hits is a lame name, but it is a great mix.  it's the customers' favorite music.  i just put it together.  : and it's selling like hotcakes.   you might want to knowthe secret formula for drawing arthur.  we'll do two letter o's, hook them together with a littleupsidedown letter u.  then we'll do a largerletter u like this.  we'll do a straight line here.  two dots here.  two lines here.  two dots here.  a curved line for his mouth.  i will add his ears.  and there's arthur.  that's great.  captioned bymedia access group at wgbh ac visit us online at pbskidsgo.org.  you can findarthurbooks and lots of other books, too, at your local library.  captioned by media access group at wgbh access.wgbh.org  and everybody that you meet has an original point of view.    and i say hey.   hey.   what a wonderful kind of day    if we could learn to work and play    and get alongwith each other    hey. what a wonderfulkind of day    hey. what a wonderful kindof day.   hey.  funding forarthur is provided by...  chuck e. cheese'sproud supporter of pbs kids, who know for safe fun, you need to make this cool move...  ...before you can makethese cool moves.  pbs kids, where a kidcan be a kid.  and by a "ready to learn"television cooperative agreement from the u.s. departmentof education through the publicbroadcasting service.  broadcasting service likearthur, love ruffman.  man, am i excited about the brandnew cast members.  whoopdedee.   we put the pedal to the metal, baby. yes.  okay, here we go....   watchfetch. with ruff ruffman, weekdays on pbs kids go.  or watch it anytime online at pbskidsgo.org. )
