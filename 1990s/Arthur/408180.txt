 chicken squawking) thou hadst better hasten thyself, good master buster.  schoolmaster ratburn will be most irate if thou art tardy.  he will punish thee roundly.  in a moment, good neighbor arthur.  i canst but help look upon yon poor girl.  nay, good master buster, look naught upon the wretched thief, lest it ruin the taste of tomorrow's thanksgiving feast.  wilst there be turkey, good master brain.  aye, and oniongarlic stew.  i couldst live without the stew, but the thought of turkey brightens my soul.  'tis most sad that our dear friend will languish in yonder stockade while we sup.  couldst we not bring her a crust of bread.  nay, good children.  she hath committed the most egregious crime known to student and schoolmaster alike.  she must contemplate the error of her ways.  but i didn't even know it was wrong.  i'll never do it again.  let me out. let me out.   yech.   ah.  because it's thanksgiving this thursday, i have a surprise for you all.  no homework.  football tickets. pumpkin pie.  no, a fivepage report due monday, one week from today.   yay.  that's a terrible surprise.  on the contrary.  i think it will help you all appreciate the many facets of this historical holiday.  i have selected a unique topic for each of you to explore that i trust you will find most illuminating.  "pilgrim fashion".  what fashion. they always wore black.  "why do we celebrate thanksgiving on the same day every year".  aw, i was hoping for the sociopolitical repercussions of the arminius/gomarus conflict.  it's your lucky day. i'll trade you.  "pilgrim cuisine".  great, five pages about yams.  i'm doomed.  five pages.  how will i ever write five pages.  this must be what college is like.  except we still have to be in bed by 9:00 and can't drive.   sorry, francine.  wow, you have more books than even i take out.  are you starting your own library.  they're for that thanksgiving report.  i couldn't find any one book that had all the information i need.  i think i strained my back.  i probably won't be able to play basketball all season.  i've got a better idea. come on.  you can probably get most of the information you need off the internet by using a search engine.  just type in what you're looking for.  then hit "search." you'll get more specific results if you put quotation marks around your search topic.  here's a list of some links that might be helpful.  be careful, though.  some stuff on the internet is inaccurate, so it's best to check your facts with other sources.  thanks.  a large part of their diet was comprised of corn and wild deer, which is called "venison." this web site has everything i need.  copy, cut, paste. hmm.  "food for thought: what the pilgrims ate" by francine frensky.  save.  i'm done. phew. that wasn't so bad.  oh, wait.  now i'm done.  here's my report, mr. ratburn.  i finished early.   mmm, very nice.  you did all this last night and it's typed.  um, yeah, i mean, i was doing the research and i thought i might as well just finish it.  "food for thought." i like it. i look forward to reading it, francine.  what.  francine: why are you staring.  i just didn't know you could work so quickly.  you must have really liked the topic.  it was okay, i guess.  just seeing if you're a robot.  i finished my report, mom.  want to look it over.  i'd love to.  buster, i don't think it counts as five pages if you make your letters so big.  sorry.  aw...   pal. oh....  oh.   my nail.  oh.  tyrell should have passed to kaminsky.  he was totally open.  catherine: hey, squirt, come here.  i was online and found some stuff you might want to use for your paper.  oh, thanks, but i finished it already.  hey, this is my paper.  you mean, you already used some of this information.  i used the whole thing.  it was perfect for the topic, so i cut and pasted it into a new document and added a title.  francine, you can't do that.  why not.  because that's plagiarism, that's why.  no, it isn't. it's called finishing your work early so you can enjoy thanksgiving.  what's plagiarism.  it's when you take someone else's work and claim it's your own.  it's basically stealing.  but i already handed it in.  so you think i can get an "f".  worse.  you could be suspended.  huh..  dad: kids, dinner's ready.  you have to tell ratburn.  this applewalnut stuffing is delicious.  it should taste familiar.  i stole the recipe from bubby.  it reminds me of when i was a little girl.  i pinched an apple from boris the greengrocer.  i got in so much trouble.  and you know what. it didn't even taste very good.  what's wrong, frankie.  you're usually finished and taking things off my plate by now.  i never do that. i'm not a thief.  i mean, i just don't feel so well right now.  can i be excused to get some air.  i'll just tell him the truth.  i didn't know it was wrong.  he'll understand.  he has to.  francine, i saw you ride up.   i think i know why you're here.  you... you do.  come in.  narrator: but it wasn't until 1848 when giovanni d'arcoli introduced goldleaf fillings, that dentists began winning the war on cavities...  the dvd of the ben kern ninehour history of dentistry.  fascinating stuff.  let's see, your paper was somewhere over here.  i was just about to grade it.  ah. here it is.  i... i have to explain.  you see, i was reading this article, and...  here you go. no doubt, you'll be disappointed.  aminus.  sorry. i couldn't give you an a.  there was some misinformation on page two.  yams were not introduced until later.  other than that, it was excellent.  uh... thanks.  tell me, what was your reference source.  a book called...  22... secret... pilgrim...  recipes.  hmm... never heard of it.  was there something else you wanted to talk to me about.  uh... i was just dying to know how i did.  happy thanksgiving.  you feeling better, kiddo.  we're just about to start dessert.  i'll be right there.  did you go to ratburn's.  was he upset.  did he give you an f.  not exactly.  "not exactly".  what does that mean.  it means i took care of it, okay.  so let's just forget about the whole thing and have some pie.  catherine: since we got hoprah's endorsement, sales have gone through the roof.  have you thought about your next book yet.  i'm already working on it.  : cut. paste. save.  cut. paste. save.  cut. paste. save.  cut. paste. save.  who should i make it out to.  the victim of your heinous crime.  "to my dear victim of my heinous..."  i knew i'd find you one day.  i am the author of that article you plagiarized off the internet.   why do you wear a mask.  is it because rage and envy have permanently disfigured you.  no, i just have very sensitive skin.  but i am filled with rage.  and i've come for my revenge.    behold, the real truth.  francine frensky...  is a plagiarist.  no, please.  i didn't know it was wrong.  i swear. i didn't know.  i came up with the title, but everything else was from the web site.  word for word.  i see.  i swear i didn't know it was wrong at the time and i was going to confess, but...  i didn't notice and you thought you might get away with it.  but even if you had gotten away with it, you still would have paid a price.  i would.  when someone plagiarizes, there are two crimes.  first, the author is robbed of credit, and then the person who plagiarizes is robbed of really learning something.  mr. ratburn, before you decide to fail or...  suspend me, i just want you to know i wrote another paper.  it's probably not as good, but...  but it's yours.  and that's much more important than whatever grade you get.  see you in class.  ratburn: muffy, nice work.  although your reference to embroidery as "pilgrim bling" felt inappropriate.  binky, arminius and gomarus were theologians, not wrestlers.   ah, francine.  not bad.  very... original.  whoohoo.  yes.  a "b".  what's so great about a "b".  nothing.  but it's my "b." all mine.  buster:  you're in them, you shoot them, you make them    it's"postcards from you"   it's"postcards from you."   this "postcard from you" was made by kids at the paseo verde library in henderson, nevada.  hello, my name is jack phelan, and i'm here in las vegas.  i've heard many things about this place, including things like...  no schools.  hi, i'm nicki sandusky, and this is where i go to school.  wow, i thought anyone in las vegas could gamble.  anyone. you have to be 21 or older.  well, you were wrong.  it's fascinating.  well, that's all i need to know about vegas.  i didn't know anything.  we're the kids of vegas who want to stay in vegas.  bye.  our next postcard comes from emma in half moon bay, california.  my name is emma.  i live in half moon bay, california.  there's a lot of fun things to do here.   but my favorite thing of all is to throw the ball against the garage.  bye, buster.  to see more"postcards from you," visit:   man:  yeah.     oh, no.  nottop supermarket clerk.  shh.   but buster recorded last week's bionic bunnyepisode and i want to be able to talk about it with him tomorrow.  shh. shh. but that show's so boring.  shh.  why does it seem like your family never, ever likes the same things you do.  hey, dad, look.  the bionic bunny laser show.  uhhuh. here, take this.   hey, mom, look.  a bionic bunny rollercoaster.  not today, arthur.  but best friends are different.  buster: hey, look, arthur.  whoosh.  that's why they're your best friends.  whoohoo.   need some help, dominic.   : calamity on checkstand 4.  dominic messes up again.  jeff is so obnoxious.  he's always trying to distract me.  arthur: who cares.  i know.  shh.  as always, one of you must be eliminated before the next round.  please be jeff. please be jeff.  and this time, the person to "check out" is...  you, bjamin. oh.  oh.... oh....  arthur: is it over.  is that what i think it is.  no, it's bionic bunny.  buster must have taped it over one of his mom's tapes.  : i think this is the episode we missed last week.  's... no.  i told you. buster just...   hey, arthur.  you gave me the wrong tape.  oh, i'm sorry.  come on in, i'll get you the right one.  wait. this is the right tape.  it's last week's show.  then why does it have supermarket clerks in it.  because it'stop supermarket clerk.  what.  you said you were going to tape thebionic bunnythreeparter.  oh, no. when you said "threeparter," i thought you meant the threepart season opener oftop supermarket clerk.  but what aboutbionic bunny.  oh, i don't watch that show anymore.  you don't watch bionic bunnyanymore..  why not.  it's all made up.  it's not truetolife.  you mean like a supermarket.  but you hate shopping.  : look, there's a new article about lucie on thetop supermarket clerk web site.  she's from detroit and has two kids and...  wow, she doesn't like jeff.  me, neither.  oh, and i'll show you what's really neat: thetop supermarket clerk viewers' poll.  cool, today's poll is on jeff.  buster hatesbionic bunny.  buster hatesbionic bunny.   yeah. oh, hey, arthur.  bionic bunny, you've got to help me.  it's busterhe's not watching your show anymore.  he's into some weird "reality" show now.   my #2 fan..  quickly. hop on.  bionic bunny: here we are.  reality tv headquarters.  we have to find out how they've brainwashed buster.  first, we have to get past that guard.  we'll disguise ourselves as tv executives.   here we go, buster's file.  it seems they've brainwashed him with... food.  of course, it's a show all about a supermarket.  that's why he likes it so much.  can you unbrainwash him.  sorry. if it doesn't involve flying, battling monsters, or lifting heavy objects, i'm kind of at a loss.  don't worry. i have an idea.   intruder alert. intruder alert.  go save your friend.  i'll take care of him.  hey, lucie, what's the matter.  come down with dominicitis today.   buster: hello.  arthur: hey, buster, want to go see thebionic bunnymarathon on saturday.  they're showing all five movies.  but we've seen them already. twice.  how about if i buy you all the candy and popcorn you can eat.  remember that scene, buster.  it was always your favorite.  yeah, but people can't actually plug up volcanoes with a comet.  it's not real.  it's not supposed to be real.  it's bionic bunny.  hey, i got a text message from muffy.  buster, you're missing the giant comet worms.   oh, my gosh.  jeff got in an accident.  you want to go back home and see if there's anything on the internet about it.  would you mind.   no, go ahead.  great. thanks.   buster: "'i didn't mean to run him over with the shopping cart,' dominic claimed, 'it just got away from me.'" unbelievable.  that dominic is a menace.  i know. i always thought jeff was mean to him, but i'm starting to have second thoughts.  why aren't you eating lunch with buster.  don't you two always eat together.  yeah, but he doesn't want to talk aboutbionic bunnyanymore.  just that boring supermarket show.  he says it's more real.  people write those reality shows, you know.  they're not really real.  brain says that show isn't real.  people write it.  what.  so you can stop watching that and start watching bionic bunnyagain, okay.  but i don't like it.  are you mad about me leaving the movie.  i'll pay you back for the candy and popcorn.  i don't care about that stuff.  i just want us to like the same things again.   oh, um, hello, mrs. bunny.  is bionic bunny home.  this brainwashing is much deeper than i thought.  if you want to save your friendship, you're going to have to go undercover.  go undercover.  watch the supermarket show along with your friend, and...  what. what.  let it brainwash you as well.  then you can pull him out of this.  this isn't something you can help me with, is it.  i knowonly flying, battling monsters and heavy lifting.  no, he's your best friend.  it's up to you.  buster: sure, arthur, i'd love to watch this week'ssupermarket clerk at your house.  but i thought you didn't like it.  no, i... really like it now.  i'll see you on friday.  ay, let's start the lessons.  andrea, dominic, benjamin, lily.  lucie.  again.  good.  bad.  very bad.   no, jeff was bad. now he's good.  dominic is the bad

do.  if i don't like the show and you don't likebionic bunny, then what will we have in common.  wow, i never thought of it like that.  maybe we're not best friends anymore.  goodbye, arthur.  oh.  here's this henry skreever comic i borrowed from you.  thanks.  it was great.  hey, wait.  we still have this in common.  that's true.  and what about the sugar bowl.  we both love the sugar bowl.  yeah, and bike riding and amusement parks and the library.  and aliens.  oh, wait, that one's just me.   bionic bunny: so your friendship is saved.  yeah. i just needed to learn there's still things we still like doing together.  i see.  well, then, if my job is done, you won't mind if i... uh...  bionic bunny..  it's not a bad show really.  and so true to life.  oh, that dominic.  hi, everyone.
