" " "  .. "p"...  .." ..  .. "r"...  oh, it's not a seven.  eight.  huh.  arthur's in trouble.  how do you get in trouble with the nurse.   what happened.  i have to go to the eye doctor.  what can you see.  it's just blurry, dr. iris.  now what do you see.  a giant worm.  huh. where.  hmm.  that better.  yeah, i can read it all.  iris: you just need glasses.  that's why you've had those headaches.  just choose the frames you like.  cool.  hmm...  ooh...  those are nice.  maybe i'll try something else.  hey.  there...  mom: those look wonderful, arthur.  very distinguished.  really.  look at that airplane up there.  look at all the leaves on the trees.  mom, you have gray hairs.  dad, have you always had those bags under your eyes.  whoa.  you look weird.  you look different.  get a new haircut.  no.   francine: hey, buster, look.  arthur's a foureyes.  . arthur's a foureyes. .   some people need glasses to see, francine.  big deal.  hey, you guys, look, i'm arthur.   huh.  oh...  i know, that's a new shirt.  afraid not.    huh.  dad: arthur.  don't talk to me.  well, it's better than being called "foureyes." if i lose them, nobody can make me wear them.  i won't even know where they land.  good riddance.    huh.   that's it, d.w.  mom: where are your glasses.  d.w. took them, mom.  i was just getting them back.  you wouldn't want to break them.  no, mom.   ouch.    arthur, where are your glasses.  i lost themat home, i think.  it's harder to see without my glasses.  just wear them.  i don't need them.  i know this school.  boys' room is the third door from this corner, right.  yeah.  see. why do i need them.  see you in class.  teacher: i marked the exams.  the examination was better than i thought it would be.  still and all...  first door...  second...  third.  if i'm not batting cleanup i'm not playing.  francine.   girls: what are you doing.  this is the girls' room.  get out of here.   girls: it's a boy.  get out. get out.   arthur: get me out of here.    oh, no.  arthur: i'm just going to have to get used to being a foureyed weirdo.  i'm wilbur rabbit and this is how we make the bionic bunny show.  cut.  what's my next line.  wilbur rabbit wears glasses just like mine.  all right.  old foureyes is back.  hi, francine.  huh.  i knowyou're wearing glasses.  yeah, i am.  foureyes.   arthur: binkywilbur rabbit wears glasses.  yeah, i saw that on tv last night.  i didn't see that.  wasn't it great how they make him fly.  don't ask me to read the problems to you.  okay.  look out, arthur's got the ball.    very good, arthur, all correct.  arthur...  how would you like to play on my basketball team today.  do you like them.  there's no glass.  they're my moviestar glasses.  don't they make me look beautiful.  wilbur rabbit wears glasses.  and his are just like mine.  and since then, i always wore glasses.  does that solve your mystery.  i guess.  it's not as good as having a lost brother.  hey, look.  who's this weird guy with mom.  that's dad.  dad doesn't have a beard, arthur.  maybe mom's divorced.  i'm waking her up right now and demanding an explanation.  ...  .  .  kids:..  i don't think it matters what you look like.  boy: arthur got glasses because he couldn't see.  some people need glasses.  girl: he went to school with the glasses on.  girl 2: most of the kids were calling him "foureyes." woman: . you look different, arthur foureyes.  .  he didn't want to wear his glasses...  because everybody was making fun of him.  i feel that that's not really nice.  you could hurt their feelings.  it's not nice to tease somebody about how they look.  looking different is okay.  it's just good to be different.  many children:..  blue eyes...  red buttons...  green eyes...  white skin...  orange hair...  brownishyellowish hair...  a long nose...  brown skin...  black eyes...  glasses and...  a red shirt...  green pants...  a weird nose...  a nice smile.  everybody looks different.  girl: it doesn't matter what's outside.  i think it matters what's inside.  it's not the way you look, it's the way you feel.  and now...   quiet down.  now, as you may have heard school pictures have just been scheduled...  what. now.  i can't have my picture taken in these rags.  for next thursday.  you have time to change your clothes, miss crosswire.  there are things to remember about school pictures.  like, don't drink six cans of soda and have your picture taken.   or rub your feet across carpet and sit in a metal chair.  aah.  or wear a flower if you have allergies.    aah.  one more out and we've got them.  we can'tthey're fourth graders.  crowd: come on.  let's go.  arthur: remember the plan.  no matter what, get the ball to francine.  break.  crowd: go, arthur.  come on.  you can do it.  go.  yay.  whoa.  buster: i got it. i got it.

on.  i'll look stupid.  do you want a nice school picture or not.  trust me.  see, it's perfect...  once you fix the rip here.  have your mom run a needle over that.  and now, for your hair.  what's wrong with my hair.   close your eyes until i tell you.  but...  do it.  muffy: okay.  you can look now.  aah.  i don't get it.  it always works for me.  get me out of this.  wait, i have an idea.   hello, flossie.  this is muffy.  flossie: muffy, my favorite little client.  oh, this is a treat.  can i bring a friend.  she really needs something special.  you got it, kid.  that's great.  thank you.  it's all set.  meet me tomorrow afternoon at the salon de beaute.  the what.  you didn't say a beauty parlor.  did you think it was a pet shop.  no way am i going in there.  i knew you'd chicken

who's here.  all: muffy.  what a surprise.  you're looking fabulous.  and what have we here.  francine.  oh, that's right.  we don't promise miraclesnot in your price range, anyway.    this is our "queen of the nile" look.  very popular.  no.   well, then, let's try for something more au courant.  don't you have anything normal.  if you insist.  i have just the thing.   i'll take that, i guessonly not much hair spray.  you got it.  one prom queen to go, extra curls, hold the sauce.  and now,ma cherie, you will rest and wake up as the girl of your dreams.   announcer: ladies and gentlemen the moment you've all been waiting for.  let's hear it for francine frensky.   francine is sporting a new hairdo.  the crowd is loving it.  play ball.  announcer: she prepares herself as she takes her place behind the plate.  there's the pitch.  huh.  strike.  announcer: dazzling play by francine.  it's the bottom of the third.  francine runs to the outfield and returns the ball to arthur, who makes the catch.  it's the final play of the game.  francine races to beat the ball, she slides and... safe.  her hairdo touches the plate just in time.  what a game.  muffy: francine.  francine.  hmm...  so, what do you think.  i knew it.  oh, if only she had hair like yours.  it's great.  see how it looks with your dress.  there goes my new soccer ball.  muffy: nowthere are things you should know about hair care.  what are you doing.  riding my bike.  i don't think so.  see. i told you it was worth it.  now, remember what i said: no swimming and wear protective headgear in the rain.  mother: honey, arthur called to remind you not to forget to bring the ball.  oh, i forgot.  absolutely no kickball.  no way.  and no lying down.  i can't do thistoo many rules.  remember my secret weapon.  well, then.  okay.   all right.  aah. aah.  do you like it.  no.  i wasn't asking you.  well, it's...  alive.   pretend you don't see them.  boys ruin everything.  incoming.  was it an accident or does she look like that on purpose.  probably a combination of gravity and stress on the hair.  you're going to get it.  muffy: francine, calm down.  both: aah.  now look what you did.  there, you can't see a thing.  yes, you can.  it's all...   if you stay still until picture time everything will be fine.  what do you mean you can't play.  she can't mess her hair.  why.  to keep it nice for school pictures.  the fourth graders will kill us if you don't play.  good.  no slouching.  good posture is the key to true beauty.  she's lost her mind.  we'll lose the game.  who needs francine.  we're just as good.   hey.  both: ooh.  can i help you find the ball.   come on, you guys, get up.  sit down.  it's one to nothing.  two to nothing.  you have to get used to this.  if you want to look nice, no more kickball.  it's just a silly game, anyway running around and getting your shoes dirty.  aah.  all: yay.  francine.  she caught it and you're out.  she wasn't even playing.  there's a poodle on your head.  yeah, and it does tricks, too.  watch.  safe. )
