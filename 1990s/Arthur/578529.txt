"a fun game "combing all the thrills of weasels and racing." d.w.: you're doing it on purpose.  arthur: i am not, i am not.   what's going on.  arthur's ruining the game.  he's not playing right.  i am soi roll the dice...  i move around the board...  d.w.: you're not having fun.  look at the little boy on the box.  that little boy is not playing withyou.  can you play another game.  i'll get it.  arthur: mom, dad, i can't write a report that i played confuse the goose.  everyone will laugh at me.  why don't you read a book.  yes, that should be quiet... uh, fun.   mom and dad said i don't have to play.  i'll read to you.  mom.  arthur said you said that he doesn't...  i don't know what you can do.  everything is too boring to be in a report.  i'm ready...   just watch wrestling until the rain stops.  how long can it rain for.  this system is very similar to a monsoon during which it rains nonstop for an entire month.  arthur, are you still there.  like it would be sohard to play one game of confuse the goose with your adorable sister.  "once upon a time..." let me guessthey live happily ever after right.  right.  i knew itboring.     help.   everybody, freeze.   : arthur's trying to bite my nose.  is that any way to treat a book.  no, no, but... she didn't want me reading to her.  why don't you draw.  d.w.: what did you draw.  a dog, and he's bored.  what did you draw.  a stick.  a stick.  from the park where you promised to take me.  i never promised you anything.  yes, you did. did not.  you did. did not.  we'll never get anything done.  did, too. did not.  did, too. did not.   have fun at grandma's.  it's raining.  we'll die out here.  come on.  if you'd behaved, we'd still be dry.  me. i didn't do anything.  i'm the cute one.  you're annoying.  oh, great, now i get to write a really exciting report about visiting my grandma.  "ient to my grandma's.  she's nice. the end." i'm doomed.  hurry upcome in, children.  this is only good weather for ducks.   beautiful weather, huh.  huh.  i thought if you were bored at home maybe you'd enjoy helping me.  help you watch tv.  no, arthur, help me clean out the attic.  but cleaning is boring.  look at all this stuff.  wow.  grandma: i just started when your dad begged...  um, when i decided to invite you over.   this is kind of creepy.  that was your father's.  so were these.  d.w.: it's a dress with legs.  they're bellbottom pants, silly.  i have a picture of him wearing them.  hello, hello, hello...  here it is.   grandma: flip that switch, arthur.  : daddy's a goof.  that's wondeorld.  where's the hurlawhirl.  it wasn't built yet.  d.w.: that is not wonderworld.  if that was wonderworld, where's the mall.  they closed the wildlife reserve to build the mall later.  really.  francine: my dad made me stop drumming so i watched wrestling.  ...watching eight hours of wrestling i hope someday i can be a wrestler, too because then i could pulverize people and get paid for it.  i watched wrestling all day.   buster: it was very... interesting.   buster: the end.   it's like living through the most boring day in history twice.   arthur, you're next.  on saturday i went to my grandma's...  oh, this will be fascinating.  no, it wasn't boring.  grandma.  this is when my house was the only one on the block.  and comic books cost 25 cents.  all: ohh... wow. cool.  that's the high school.  do you know who that boy is.  that's mr. haney, your principal.   my grandma knows so much cool stuff.  do our grandparents know this, too.  probably even more.  why not ask them and find out.  by the way, here comes somebody you might recognize.  that boy...  is mr. ratburn.     kids: and now...   you know what we do when we are bored.   hi, my name is waleska sanguita santana perez.  this is what we do in my class when we are bored.  let's go and see.  these girls are playing a game.  they're having a good time playing this game.  it's good to play a game when it's rainy out and a boring day.  okay, i'll show you more.  this girl is making blocks.  i love blocks.  it's a really fun game, but i don't like it when they fall on your headit hurts a lot.  this boy is reading an arthur book.  that's a great, beautiful thing to do when you're bored.  these girls are playing chess.  i don't know how to play, but they do really well.  these boys and girls are playing computer.  they're writing and drawing.  that's what we do when we are bored.  isn't this a fun classroom.  oh, we forgot to tell you.  all: we love to dance.   kids: and now...  my grandma thora's pretty great.  she knows everything a grownup should know.  bionic bunny is about to escape from dr.  warthog...  whoa, who's dr. warthog.  he's part of the rat gang, david.  get with the program.  go ahead, arthur, what happened next.  arthur: she's always there to fill in if somebody gets sick.  sa.  she's terrific.  there's only one thing you never want to hear her say.  grandma: arthur, d.w....  cookies.  kids.  hmm... they were here a minute ago.    wait. come back.  the kids' doctor is doctor...  bailey.  right.  i left his number, um...  next to the phone numbers where you'll be.  thanks for covering for us.  we'll be back when my dad's feeling better.  there's nothing i like better than taking care of these kids.  tonight i'll cook something special.  um, mom, i left some money so you can order in.  oh, you think i'm a terrible cook because you're a professional.  i've got a new recipe i want to try out.  grandma: grace, of course i'd be happy to help.  you know i would.  : one tablespoon...  it seems like short notice but if we're organized, it should be no problem.   well, why don't you and carol come by tonight and we can finalize...  oh, darn.  she's using the recipe i used for my topographical map of mexico.  we could pretend to be sick.  then we could skip dinner.  no way, she'd make us her special chicken soup.  pukearama.  maybe it won't be that bad.  arthur, remember last thanksgiving.  when grandma made... pecan pie.   aah.  yeah, you're supposed to take the nuts out of their shells.  just tell grandma thora her cooking is bad.  i don't want to hurt her feelings.  me either.  hey, i know who'll eat it.  grandma: kids. dinner.  hold on, carol.  now, if you kids want more, just holler.  carol. now, listen, dear, we only have two days...  spread it around like you ate some.  maybe it's not that bad, d.w.  arthur, you're the bravest big brother ever.  hey, trade you.  look. yum, yum, yum.   d.w., leave pal alone.  can't i just taste it.   that dog's not as dumb as he looks.   who'd like pudding.  uh... uh...  it may have cooked too long.  i've been on the phone for the fundraiser.  are you running bingo this year.  no bingo this year.  it's a bake sale.  and guess who's in charge.  you... you're going to cook.  for other people.  that's right.  maybe you kids could help me make some signs.  scrape off the burnt bits and this pudding will be just fine.  doesn't sound that bad to me.  all you need is the right sales plan.   what's that.  it's simple.  who says you have to tell people it's food.  what if you tell people they're for exercise.     or maybe you could use it for clay and make...  a statue.  it would last forever.    i don't think so.  well, then i guess you've got no choice.  you have to tell her the truth.  i was afraid you'd say that.   here, catch.  tomatoes.  can't make cookies without breaking a few tomatoes.  we're sure to hook a lot of the old girls with these flyers you've made.  grandma, there's something i've been meaning to talk about.  it's your cooking.  it's just that, well... it kind of tastes, um...  thora.  well, hello, sara.  i heard a blurb on the radio today for our bake sale.  how on earth did you do it.   arthur, the good ship p.t.a. would be sunk if it wasn't for your grandmother.  you must be awfully proud of her.  yeah...  macgrady: well, i'll just mosey on back to the old homestead unless you want a hand in the kitchen, thora.  yes. i mean...  don't you need help.  i already have two assistants.  besides, i expect you to have plenty of that cobbler of yours tomorrow.  grandma: that's very grownup of you to offer to help, but everything's under control.  oops.  nothing to worry about.  but you said we were your assistants.  i can handle this.  cooking runs in our family.  in fact, your father started cooking when he was your age.  i believe it.  one thing leftchange our names so nobody will know we were involved.  if we could just keep people from buying them.  from now on, i'll be mrs. ida b. forkenstern.  wait, i've got it.  i know how we can keep people from buying those cookies.  really. how.  just wait till tomorrow.  grandma: sara will be collecting money.  if you have problems, just grab me.  thora, one of the banners blew down.  kids, can you finish setting up.  i'll be back.  how are you going to keep people from buying her cookies.  shh....  i brought my birthday money.  it should be enough to buy all of them.  you can't eat these.  you're too young to die.  i'm not going to eat them.  come on.  my locker's down here.  we'll stuff them in there.   here it is.  grandma.  what are we going to do.  i've got it.  come on.  it's no good.  the grommets are torn out.  if you had sticks...  i'm with you, mrs. read.  wait here, i've got just the thing.  arthur: look, grandma.  the bake sale is a big success.  what.  you sold all those cookies already.  well...    grandma: are you all right.  arthur: is mr. morris okay.  mr. morris's foot isn't broken, thank goodness.  but something heavy must have fallen on it.  what i wonder is: who could have put my cookies in that closet.  well, uh... we did, grandma.  arthur.  .  but why.  we didn't want to hurt your feelings.  thora, there you are.  i've been looking for you.  we're doing landoffice business.  it's already our best year ever.  sara macgrady, tell me the truth.  am i a bad cook.  you. why do you ask.  you just get preoccupied.  you're too busy to cook.  we still love you.  and you're good at lots of other things.  you made costumes for the band.  yeah, and you fixed daddy's car.  no matter how you slice it you'll never make a threecourse meal out of a bicycle.  better to get on it and ride.  i suppose that's right.  i guess i'm lucky to have friends like you three.  better get to work on that banner.  we'll go clean up those cookies.  oh, and arthur, d.w..  thanks for telling me the truth.  i know it took a lot of courage.  we love you, grandma.  where did all the cookies go.  they're all cleaned up.   hey, guys, look what i found.  a little dirt on them, but... oh, delightful.  you might want to knowthe secret formula for drawing arthur.  we'll do two letter o's, hook them together with a littleupsidedown letter u.  then we'll do a largerletter u like this.  we'll do a straight line here.  two dots here.  two lines here.  two dots here.  a curved line for his mouth.  i will add his ears.  and there's
