your mom will wash it.  it'll be too messy to read but at least you sort of gave it to her.  no, you want it far away from the house.  leave it in a book and return the book to the library.  you could drop it into a storm sewer.  it will be discharged into bear lake and continue on to the halonga river.  the envelope will be carried through the panama canal to the pacific ocean.  trade winds will eventually guide it to china.   if you tried to lose it, arthur you'd be in trouble for losing it and for whatever you did.  but i didn't do anything.  i'll just have to figure it out myself.  mr. haney told me the envelope was for mom but he didn't actually say to give it to her.    oh, sorry, pal.  and he didn't say i had to tell her about it.  he just said it wasformom.  hmm...    oh, sorry.
