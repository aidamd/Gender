 look. there's a sign up ahead.  your next stop, the buster zone.  what makes you say that.  you're wearing two different colored socks and you didn't brush your teeth.  it all points to one conclusion: you were in a rush.  why. because you slept late.  that's amazing.  i'm reading mrs. marble's handbook for young detectives.  it's all in the details.  arthur.  arthur.  panting, a look of urgency...  aha. he's trying to tell us something.  it's happened.  it's finally happened.  what's happened, buster.  i saw a...  wait, not here.  theymight be listening.  let's meet after school.  buster: i had just fallen asleep when all of a sudden i heard a strange noise.   electronic humming ) buster: and there it was, as plain as daymy first real ufo.  wait a minute.  you saw a ufolastweek.  no, no, that was just the little light on the smoke alarm.  these were the real things.  they flew right overy house.  did you say "they".  just how many ufos were there.  um, three.  no, no, six.  oh, i don't know.  there were a lot of them.  buster: anyway, i went downstairs.   hello, ufos. hello.   buster: and somehow, i knew exactly what that meant.  it was alien for...  "we come in peace." brain: are you sure it wasn't alien for "car alarm".  it wasn't a car.  it was a ufoan "undeniable flying object".  arthur: it was probably just a plane.  or maybe a helicopter.  oh, yeah.  could a plane or helicopter pull you up in a tractor beam.   buster: take you 200 million lightyears away then stick you in an alien zoo, where everyone stares at you and laughs at you all day long.  quit staring at me.   well, all right i made that part up but i really did see something.  i hate to tell you, but ufos don't exist.  how do you know.  they could...  there's no evidence for them just a lot of crazy theories.  they are not crazy theories.  they're good theories made by normal people like me.  you'll see, brain.  i'll get you proof.  then we'll see who has the shoe on the other hand.   just a little more.  leave it to muffy to have the world's heaviest telescope.  and it's never even been opened.  ah, instructions.  aw. they're in japanese.  oh, that's better.  "place the etx90/ec refractor on the altazimuth mount." see anything yet.  not yet.  whoa.  what. what..  mr. haney has purple pajamas.  buster, you're supposed to be looking at the sky.  oh, yeah.  aw... this is kind of boring.  i'm going to bed.  wow. look at the moon.  ooh. the space station.  : got any threes.  nyet. go fish.   wait a minute, what's that.  buster: feast your eyes on that.  on what.  that. it's a ufo.  no, it isn't.  it's a shooting star.  or, in more scientific terms, a small object such as a meteoroid, entering the earth's atmosphere.  we'll see who's an uncle's monkey, mr. smarty pants.   how about that.   jupiter.  the crosswire blimp.  this has to be something.  it has legs.  that's a fly's leg.  he must have been on the lens.  herethis is a book on astronomy.  instead of asking me questions every five minutes why don't you just see if there's a picture of it in here first.  buster: thanks, mom.  hey. that might be something.  aw, it's just a stupid comet.   "comets are big pieces of dirty ice..." blah, blah, blah "only rarely found by amateur astronomers." hey. it might not be a ufo, but it's something.  "to calculate the orbit of the comet observe its movement over a period of days." "then press f12." computer voice: the object at right ascension 3.6 hours plus 20 degrees will collide with earth in 37 days.   huh.  hey, mom, what would happen if a comet hit the earth.  well, it would depend on the size, of course but first, there'd probably be a big explosion.  then dust might block out the sun leading to another ice age.  in fact, some people believe that a comet is what caused the dinosaurs to die out.  why do you ask.  oh, no reason.  bitzi: some people believe that a comet is what caused the dinosaurs to die out...  computer voice: object will collide with earth in 37 days...  37 days... 37 days...  good night, honey.  night good, ommy.  comet is coming.  comet is coming...  comet is coming... comet is coming...  comet is coming...  comet is coming... comet is coming.  mr. president, the latest numbers show the baxter comet will hit earth in, uh, one hour.  we got to call us bionic bunny.   bionic bunny: no.  : any eights.  nyet. go fish.    don't panic, arthur, but a comet is coming: big explosion, another ice age.  pass it on.  : okay...   hi, fern.  did you get the news about the comet.  yep, strange head gear, a belief that the sky is falling.  i'm sorry to say this, arthur but according to mrs. marbles buster has finally lost his cookies.   buster: listen up, everyone.  there's a comet coming.  we have to come up with a plan.   didn't you hear what i said.  binky: yeah, yeah, the comet's coming.  so is my fairy godmother.  kids: hahaha.  brain: no way.  why should i tell people a comet is coming.  because they'll believeyou.  you seem so sciencey.  that's because i back up what i say with facts unlike some people.  and "sciencey" isn't a word.  but i have prooflook.  it does kind of look like a comet.  i'd have to doublecheck your data.  come on...  we've only got 35 days left.  binky: this is a waste of time.  arthur: what are we doing here.  buster, why couldn't this have waited till tomorrow.  it's cold.  just be patient.  this is important.  you'll see.  brain: i've checked buster's findings and...  he's right.  there really is a comet headed towards earth.   there. now do you believe me.  kids: comet. comet. comet.  ow.   hmm. could be a clue.   fern: and then using my little gray cells i determined that the curious metal object was actually an important part of the telescope and without it we were getting all the wrong readings.  so i quickly climbed up the tree, and...  and we fixed the telescope and discovered the comet wasn't going to hit the earth.  the end.  tell it again.  i like the part where arthur runs around like a chicken.  no. no more.  buster: here it is.  "cat saver discovers comet." brain: hey, they got my name wrong.  they called me "the bran." it turns out i'm not the only amateur to discover something in space.  a girl named heather mccurdy discovered a planetoid with her friends.  it's still pretty amazing, buster.  yeah, i just wish it was going to come back sooner.  we won't see it again for another three years.  brain: maybe they will have discovered alien life forms by then.  you mean you're a believer.  if there's intelligent life up there then there must be intelligent life out there.  voice: cut. cut.  that was terrible.  where's the emotion.  where's the passion.  okay. everybody take five.  kids: and now...  girl: this is the ladd observatory.  and we're going to be looking through a big telescope.  welcome to ladd observatory.  bob is the caretaker.  i've got some old slides i want to show you.  he knows a lot about astronomy.  bob: okay, there's the way mars looked in 1905.  girl 1: astronomy is things in the night sky, like...  girl 2: planets and the whole universe.  everything beyond earth.  bob: okay, we're going to take a look at the telescope.  girl: once we went upstairs there was this big telescope.  boy: this telescope is 110 years old.  and if you look above you we have a dome with an opening in it.  we had to pull a rope...  and the rope moved the ceiling so it was right in the spot that we needed it.  girl 2: so we could focus the telescope.  girl 1: first we looked at the moon.  boy: the moon looks like a half a circle.  girl: i see lots of craters.  really big craters.  girl 1: it looks like a big ball of snow with a whole bunch of craters on it.  boy: i see flat spots, mountains...  everything.  and then we got to see mars.  i can see the polar ice caps.  girl: it's yellowish orange.  it looks like a big ball of fire.  girl 1: the word "astronomy" kind of sounds like high school stuff to me but it's actually really fun for me.  and now...  man: you two have always been good neighbors so i wanted you to have thelma.   row, row, row your boat    gently down the stream    merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily    you have caught a bream.    : goodbye, mr. sipple.  arthur: i'm surprised i feel sad that mr. sipple is leaving.  when he first moved in,i couldn't wait for him to go.  mr. sipple loved to barbecue fish.  especially late at night.  how about a little midnight snapper, lad.   and he liked to sing in the shower reallyloud.   i'm a moo, you're a moo, everyone's a moomoo...    jack was every inch a sailor    five and 20 years a whaler.   keep it down out there.  it's 9:00 in the morning and some of us are trying to hear ourselves sing.  but we'll have something to remember him by.  watch out.  that's not a toy.  that's my pet you're holding.  it's not a pet, d.w.  it's a plastic fish.  he's just jealous because he has to walk his pet.   ihola.  d.w.: i win.  i am the stare master.  no, you didn't, you cheated.  did not.   pal, be careful.   : arthur, he licked me.  call the veterani might need rabbit shots.  that's just amigo.  don't worry, he wouldn't hurt a fly.  we are the molinas, your new neighbors.  hi, i'm arthur.  i'm d.w.  i'm four.  what good luck.  my daughter, vicita, is 3.  we also have a son, alberto but he's 13, a bit older than you, i think.  um, yeah.  five years older.  tell your parents that we would love to have you all over next weekend.  ivamos, amigo.  3i remember when i was that age.  so innocent.  this vicita is going to need someone to show her the ropes.  great.  all alberto and i have in common is that we live on the same block.  hyah. kote.  arthur: that's alberto molina.  what's he doing.  practicing kendo, the ancient martial art of fencing with bamboo sticks.  he does it every morning.  he's probably a master.  coolmaybe he'll teach it to you.  are you kidding. he's 13.  he won't want to have anything to do with me.  i'll be lucky if he doesn't give me a wedgie.  what's that.  i don't know but i don't want to find out.  let's see.  first, i'll teach vicita tower of cows.  confuse the goose is much too complex.  she probably doesn't even know what a goose is.  : we're going to have so much fun.  d.w.: i'll show her how to ride a twowheeler.   and how to be a good little sister.  he did it.  it wasn't me.  and best of all,i'll be in charge for once.  we're going to play rodeo.  i'm the cowboy, you're the cow.  hey, that sounds like fun.  here's the rope to tie me up with.  it'll be just like having another kate.  except she'll talk and walk and won't live in my room.  arthur: why do i have to wear a dumb bow tie.  i bet alberto's not wearing a bow tie.  d.w.: my fish should meet their fish.  arthur's dog's got to meet their dog.  would you two settle down.  this is going to be fun.  : if i pull my ear it means we have to go home.  got you.  welcome.  so lovely to see you.  mr. molina: we lived in youngstown but originally we're from ecuador.  hors d'oeuvres.  mmm, this seviche is fantastic.  where on earth did you get it.  i made it.  come down to my new cafe.  i'll give you the recipe.  i'm vicita.  i'm 3 7/8.  you're going to be my friend.   vicita, because you're new here and not quite asmatureas me i have decided that i'm going to be your teacher.  first, we'll play pick up ticks.  you have to pick up as many ticks as you can before the sand goes from here to here.  go.  uh, okay.  i win.  you're a great friend.  mr. molina: alberto, show arthur your room.  sure, why not.  arthur: this silence is terrible.  you've got to say something.  uh, pretty cool stairs.  i just said the dumbest thing in the world.  i know what it'll be like: posters of rock groups.  or even worse, posters of girls.  here we are.  arthur: wow.  yup, and i still have more to unpack.  arthur's mom: i had a crystal bird just like that...  alberto: checkmate.  youngstown was very nice, but...  oh, those winters, and all the snow.  it would be great for skiing, if you had any hills.   you're the hot tomato.  i win again.   : can we go home now.  i can't play any more games.  alberto: here are some spanish bionic bunny comics.  you can borrow them.  arthur: bionic bunny fights a giant train.  i've never seen this one.  actually, that'stortuga mala the giant tortoise who turns into a train.  his first appearance was in issue 892.  thanks.  whatever.  bye.   they're very nice.  i never even had to pull my ear.  nice.  alberto is so cool.  d.w.: the secret to a good flip is knowing the right time to start flipping.   look what i can do.  d.w.: yeah, that's very nice but we're doing flips, and that's not a flip.  arthur: i thought i'd give you something.  if you want to talk, push this button.   pretty cool, huh.  um, right...  thanks.   hello.  arthur: alberto, look out the window.  sorry to bother you.  i just wanted to see if it works.  it works.  greatwhat are you doing.  algebra.  cool.  hey, what does "conejo bionico"mean.  alberto: it means bionic bunny.  thanksover and out.   : yes.  hi, it's me, arthur.  i know.  what doeselmean.   want to read my picture book.  notoday, i'm teaching you how to play tower of cows.  now, listen closely, it's very tricky.  you have to put these cows on top of each other.  it's easier the first time if you do it on something hard.   that's it.  i'm going home.  you said to put the cows on top of each other so that's what i did.  i was supposed to teach you how to do it.  you're the worst student i've ever had.   arthur: there's a party at the molinas'.  i'll change my clothes.  i think it's a private party.  what do you mean.  it means we're not invited.  probably because you're always bugging alberto.  i don't bug alberto.  do i.  maybe they just wanted to see some other friends.  d.w.: i don't care if i ever see that vicita again.  some people are so bossy.  no, kate, like this.  alberto's showing some kendo moves.  i bet they look really cool.   smells like chicken.  what is ramn seasoning it with.  why don't we go to the movies.  oh.  you probably want your comics back.  hold on to them.  was it a fun party.  it sure sounded fun.  it was okay.  my grandparents and cousins came.  here's some chicken.  thanks, i'll give it to my dad.  coolsee you later.  there's something in there for you.  arthur: "ite tengo." what's that.  ah,"te tengo." "i got you." : come on, thelma.  we're going for a walk.   what's wrong. what's wrong.  : the peas are touching the potatoes.  that's just the way peas are, vicita.  see. they roll.   d.w.: stand back.  quick, i need a knife.  : oh.  that's better.   green and white foods can never touch.  it's a 3 7/8 thing.  how did you know just what to do.  because the same thing happened to me.  really.  wow.  will you show me how to blow bubbles.  and how to tie my shoes.  wuhf.  is that right.  nowoof.  it's an "oo" sound.  how's this.  iguau.  not bad.  but it's a silent g, like this:   hi, everyone, it's me, buster.  if you love the great food we get to eat in elwood city, you won't believe all the great food i'm trying on my trip with my dad.  mmm... don't you just want to eat some.  i'm tasting everything and i'm sending it all back to my friends in elwood city on my very own video postcards.  they'repostcards from buster.  visit us visit us online at pbskidsgo.org.  you can findarthurbooks and lots of other books, too, at your local library.  caption center wgbh educational foundation]  it's a simple message and it comes from the heart    believe in yourself    for that's the place to start    and i say hey.     and i say...     you can fly.     believe in yourself    and i say...     you can fly.     believe in yourself    yo mama.     and i say...     you can fly.     believe in yourself    and i say...     what a wonderful kind of day funding forarthurwith captioningis provided by...  chuck e. cheese's, proud supporter of pbs kids, helping kids discover the fun of learning not only what theworldcan do, but also whattheycan do.  pbs kids, where a kid can be a kid.  and by a ready to learntelevision cooperative agreement from the u.s. departmentof education through the publicbroadcasting service.  and by contributionsto your pbs station from: every week...  that's me.  martha speaks is proof positive...  do we love llamas, people.  ...there's nothing like a talking dog.  hello.   you guys are really irritating.  does "irritating" mean "fun".  on your mark, go.  martha speakson pbs kids.  wow.    )
