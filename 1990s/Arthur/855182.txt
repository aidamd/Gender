i say hey   hey.   what a wonderful kind of day    if we could learn to work and play    and get along with each other   hey.   what a wonderful kind of day   hey.   what a wonderful kind of day   hey.  hey, d.w..  hey.  whoa...   arthur: grandpa dave, grandma thora, mom, dad, dw, kate and pal.  that's my family.  did you know there are all sorts of different types of families in the animal kingdom.  like these tamarin monkeys.  sometimes they have two dads that help the mom raise their young.  can buster sleep over this weekend.  ask your father.  can buster sleep over.  ask your other father.  well, can he.  ask your mother.   or how about elephants.  all of the females in the family take care of a new baby.   and in arabian babbler families, birds who aren't even related feed each other's chicks.   well, hello there.  have some pudding.  beef stroganoff.  cocktail weenie.  mmm.  i like being an arabian babbler.  what's your family like.   i hereby call this meeting of the tough consumers to order.  so, what's on the agenda.  a protest.  sticky chicken is opening a franchise right across the street from the old one.  outrageous.  they're drowning us in trans fats.  let's picket those crispy sticky chicken pickings.  when's the opening.  this sunday at 3:00.  i can't go.  what. why.  but i got a great deal on four chicken suits.  believe me, there's nothing i'd rather do than dress up as poultry and publicly shame a corporate juggernaut.  but i'm spending the weekend at the vanderloos.  the vanderloos.  who are they.  it all started six months ago...   that's when my mom started dating archie vanderloo, a friend of hers from work.  i like archie just fine.  he's smart, has traveled all over the world...  but he likes to cook very complicated dinners: souffls, touffes, eiffel towers of mashed yams...  i like my food simple.  archie has twins: angie and ansel.  we're the same age, but that's where the similarities end.  angie is into everything hip and trendy.  she talks with all this slang.  i can barely understand a word she says.  rattles, frizzman, you're so nova.  do you mush kitty pow pow.  aren't they dwell.  i'm, like, "side order, please." wanna make muffins.  um, okay.   woopwoop.  come on, frizzman, make those muffins.  rattles: ansel's different.  he has more energy than anyone i've ever met.  and he's really competitive, but not in a mean way.  man, you're strong.  almost had me there.  come on, best of five.  great effort.  you were this close.  120.  but that last point was a nailbiter.  bet you win the next round.  i can take the vanderloos in small doses.  but a whole weekend.  i'll never survive.  sure you will.  but you must be like bamboo.  what does that mean.  i should be tall, green and leafy.  i think i'm more of a moss.  she means that you should be more flexible.  just do whatever those twins want and the time will pass by like that.  but how.  i can't keep up with ansel, and i don't speak angie.  relax.  it's only wednesday.  we've got two days to train you.  peep my sabots, gup.  fearsome.  that movie was gigabad.  tetrabad.  but j.j. boggs is muy melty.  simonize my sideburns.  now i'm smelted.  we've got to build up your stamina.  if you can spend a whole day with a little kid, ansel will be a cinch.  no offense, but james doesn't seem like much of a workout.  isn't he kind of shy and quiet.  oh, he's got more energy than you'd think.  and he has friends.  see you in five hours.  have fun.   rattles: tommy, put that down...  ah.  help.  mayday. mayday.  here: a mix of wheatgrass, kale and spirulina.  it tastes awful, but it'll give you a boost in an emergency.  here's your slang dictionary.  we still can't figure out what "simonize my sideburns" means, but hopefully angie won't use that.  so, how do you feel.  ready to be the perfect vanderloo houseguest, thanks to you guys.  honey.  there are some things i'd like to talk with you about regarding this weekend.  can we do it tomorrow.  between my slang homework and my play date with the tibbles, i'm beat.  play date with the tibbles.  it's a long story.  but don't worry.   the vanderloo kids and i will get along just fine.  good night.  before you go inside, i just wanted to let you know that...  enter, frizzman.  kudos and bienvenudos.  hope you brought your hiking boots.  i thought we could climb mt. kanikanook before dinner.  uh... yay.  be there in a sec.  sorry, mom.  duty calls.  fearsome sabots, angie.  then tolon, this dwell new gup, was all, "text me a novel," and i was like, "roll tape," but he was on mute.  gigabad, right.  hold on.  my, uh, sabot's untied.  uh...  let him drizzle.  if he mushes you, check, please.  if not, uh...  ...hit snooze.  we're almost there.  race you to the top.    nice finish.  you would have won if you hadn't tripped.  i'll give you a tensecond head start on the race back down.  one...   two...  three...  four...  frizzman, want to skittle to bilge postvittles.   uh...   uh...  simonize my sideburns.  huh.  sure, okay, whatever.   hey, rattles, you asleep.  mmm... yes.  i just wanted to say, i used to think you were kind of cool and aloof.  but now, after spending some time with you, i think you're going to be a great brother.  good night.  good night.  what..  what do you mean, "brother".  didn't your mom tell you.  she and dad are getting married.   i tried to tell you earlier today.  and yesterday, too.  i'm really sorry you had to find out this way.  does dad know about this.  yes, and he's fine with it.  but how do you feel.  are you upset.  no, i like the vanderloos.  they're... strange, but nice.  but i can't be bamboo anymore.  is that some of angie's slang.  because i really don't understand.  what i mean is i can't pretend i fit in any longer.  i'm nothing like them.  oh, honey, you don't have to fit in.  i don't.  no.  i want you all to get along, but if this family is going to work, we have to accept each other as we are.  that could take some time.  there's no rush.  i'm just happy you're willing to give it a try.  ansel: "had to do something.  see ya, rattles." i bet he left for good.  this is all your fault.  why'd you make him dance to that awful music.  my fault.  negativo.  frizzman mushes bilge.  rattles: actually, i don't.  that is, if "mush" means "to like." i'm not really sure.  but if we're going to be a family, you're going to have to speak english sometimes.  nopro novo siblano.  i mean... okay.  and you've probably noticed, but i'm not very good at sports.  really.  but when we played pingpong yesterday...  i lost every single round.  by a lot.  it's true.  you really are pretty terrible.  and i'm fine with that.  finally, i'd like to introduce you to what i like to eat: a delectable concoction of dough and yeast, d with diced onions and baked to perfection.  also known as the bialy.  bon apptit.  crowd: sticky chicken makes you sicken.  sticky chicken makes you sicken.  "makes you sicken".  you made it.  that's the best you could do.  it's not even grammatically correct.  i brought reinforcements.  want to see who can shout the loudest.  ave, gup.  dwell nugget duds.  they're a little strange, but they're family.  don't give this store a single penny.  two sticky chickens is too many.  and now a word from us kids.  hi, my name is tyler.  welcome to beaver summer camp.  today, we're in the mood to blend.  mmm...  shake it up.  arthur's friend rattles is part of a blended family, where two families are combined to make one.  families can be blended, and so can lots of other things.  whoa.  we made new colors.  rainbow.  don't try this without adult supervision.  ready.  we're pouring the baking soda into the vinegar.  now, that's cool.  vinegar and baking soda make gas.   mix it up.  we're blending cornstarch and water together.  alone, the ingredientsare pretty boring.  but mixed together, they create something magical.  it's quicksand.  when you put pressure on it, it's a solid.  and when you put your hand in slowly, it's a liquid.  i can't get my hands out.  it's a solid and a liquid.  it's so cool.  sometimes, things go a little crazy.  whoa.  we made two reactions: heat and gas.  it's warm like a fire.  blending takes a little...  now. no...  patience.  teamwork.  time.  effort.  persistence.  and voil...  ice cream.  mmm.  blending can be...  explosive.  whoa.  messy.  ew.  delicious.  mmm.  stinky.  challenging.  that was not successful.  but lots of fun.  whoa.  wow.  bye.  and now, back to arthur.  kitchen secured, dw.  kitchen secured.  green alien slime at 6:00.  what do you mean, 6:00.  it's 3:00.  6:00 doesn't mean the time on the clock, dw.  it's just a way of saying where the slime is located.   should we call mom and dad.  no.  we can handle this ourselves.     watch out.  behind you.  1:00, giant mice.  do you hear something, honey.   nope, not a thing.    oh, we're camping at the lake, ah.    we're going to vegetate, ah.    i really just can't wait, ah.    it's not funny.  it's mean that you're going without us.  dw.  when parents go away without their kids, they feel guilty and bring home presents.  don't wreck it.  i don't care.  i want to go to the lake.  i want to vegetable.  it's only for two nights.  and grandma thora is coming to take care of you.   hello.  hi, honey.  i am so sorry, but our plane home from cancun got canceled.  and we can't get another flight until monday.  no.  grandma: i feel terrible.  i know how much you were looking forward to your vacation.  oh, what a cute little monkey.   it's okay, mom.  it's not your fault.  we'll go camping some other time.  bye.    wasn't that so sad.  i thought my heart would break.  wait, you didn't want them to go on vacation and now you're sad they can't.  yeah.  didn't you see mom's face.  i thought she was going to cry.    i guess parents really do need a break sometimes.  especially from you.  i wonder if there's some way we could fix this.  i called every babysitter we know.  no one's available.   i guess there's nothing more we can do.  dw: wait, wait, wait and wait.  tell them, arthur.  tell them.  okay, so dw and i came up with a way for you to have your...  it's called a "staycation," and it was my idea.  look.  what do you see.  uh...  someone was playing with our tent.  yes.  and that someone was me.  and arthur.  since you can't go to the lake...  you can camp here, in the yard.  you can spend the whole weekend out there while we're in here with kate, not bothering you at all.  that's really nice of you kids, but you're too young to stay on your own for that long.  dad: although we could spend just the day out there.  of course, we'd have to take the baby monitor and check in from time to time.  yeah, yeah.  and we won't disturb you at all.  come on, you two should have a vacation.  even if it's just for a little while.  cold cuts, milk, peaches, pretty much everything you need.  we'll be fine.  go away.  enjoy the great outdoors.  okay.  so, arthur, you're in charge.  what..  you can't do that.  this was my idea.  i'm in charge.  how about arthur is in charge, and you are...  the communications officer.  so, if there are any emergencies...   then i get to make the call.   i need your phone.  i'm the communicationer.  don't run down the battery, okay.  ready, hon.  ready.   hello.  this is your communicationer speaking.  if you hear, "help, help, help." that means you have to come back.  got it, dw.  have fun.  don't watch too much tv.   is it me, or are there a lot of birds around.  this is dw read, recording hour one of mom and dad's staycation.  so far, so good.   time to change the diaper.   and we have our first emergency.  calling mom, calling dad.  help, help.  are you kidding.  we've changed kate's diaper before.  come on.  who has the best brother in the world.  you do.  it's arthur.  stinkarama.   testing, testing.  hour two of mom and dad's staycation and dw read is on patrol.  so far, i am not seeing any...  arthur: no. no way.  hang on, arthur, i'm coming.  is it an emergency.  no, i just can't get the tv to work.  that's totally an emergency.  let's call mom.  no.  come here.  what do you see.   mom and dad.  having fun without me.  exactly.  they're having funvacation fun.  and we're not going to bother them.  okay.  but how are we going to fix the tv.  all you needed was a new battery, guys.  but since i'm here, why don't i try and upgrade your system.  i can wire it so you can run your tv, cable, phone, lights and fridge all from your computer.  this is dw, reporting on the staycation.  brain is fixing our house, kate is asleep, arthur is goofing off, and so far, there are no emergencies.   also, buster is visiting, dressed like a zombie.  it's an alien mask, dw.  and check this out.  the eyes light up.  cool.  are you wearing that for halloween.  maybe.  except i also want to be a xylobird.  you know, halfbird, halfxylophone.  arthur has some really goofy friends.  anyway, i've checked the entire house and there's nothing more to do.  oh, wait.  i forgot about the birds.   hi, birdies.  are you getting enough to eat.  here, birdy birdy.  come and get it.  you want your bread toasted.  sure.  or maybe i'll go as "eager beaver." only instead of trees, he can gnaw down apartment buildings with his radioactive teeth.  dw: arthur, help.  help.  oh, brother.  this is like her eighth emergency.  hold your horses, dw.  i'm coming.   dw: go away.  i didn't want you inside.  so what is it now.  whoa.  how'd a bird get in here..  i don't know.  let's call mom.  no, this is not an emergency.  we just have to open a window.  youopen a window.  i'm hiding in the bathroom.  arthur: come on, little birdy.  this way.   i don't know what arthur would do without me.  he wouldn't even know about the bird if it wasn't for me.    if you hold the net, i'll try and push him toward you.  arthur.  can you not bother us.  we're busy.  is it an emergency if water is pouring all over the place and i can't make it stop.  what.  what did you do..  it wasn't me.  it's the toilet's fault.  maybe kate's diaper was too big for it.  you're not supposed to flush diapers down the toilet.  how was i supposed to know that.   okay, all patched together.  let's see how this works.   i can't see.  hang on.  i'll use my eyes.  keep dumping, dw.  keep dumping.  arthur.  sorry about the lights.  i should have it fixed in a few.   uhoh.   now what.  is this going to wake up baby kate.   hang on, kate.   where'd those new birds come from.  is it an emergency now, arthur.  no, it's not.   okay, it is.  call them.  ayeaye.  only, where's the phone.  how would i know.    dw read, dw read answering the phone.   what's going on in there.  are you okay.  we're fine, only...  help.  dad: i got the birds out.  mom: toilet's fixed.  i reset the circuit breaker.  floor's good.  and i saved the day.  ah.  nothing like a burnt marshmallow after an exciting evening.  and now we're all having a staycation.  so why were there birds in the house.  i don't know.  i just fed them.  i didn't ask them to move in with us.   well, here's to a great staycation, everyone.  yay.  i'm still the communicationer, right.  right.  only let's hope we don't have any more emergencies.  and no more surprises, either.
