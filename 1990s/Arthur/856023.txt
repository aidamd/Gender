pets but we know what to do.  my cat was crying.  i brushed her fur, then she stopped crying.  my turtle was lost.  i looked everywhere in the house.  i finally found him at the lake playing with his friends.  my turtle was eating chips in the bath and i said, "get out, i have to take a bath." my cat was talking so i gave him soda and he was fine.  my parrot was lost.  i looked for him.  i found him eating oreos in my bed and now we always have to hide the oreos.  my cat barked.   i took something out of his mouthit was a toy dog that could bark.  my dog was in trouble.  it was meowing.  so i gave it dog food and it was barking.  my dog was in love with a pig.  i took it away and the dog was fine.   i bought me a pet and my pet pleased me.     oh, diddle, diddle, diddle dee, dee, dee.     my pet gave me love and he was friend    stayed with me till the bitter end.   and now...  it's no big surprise when my sister d.w. does something annoying like the one time she beat me at checkers.
