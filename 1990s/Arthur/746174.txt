oceans.  arthur: and mr. ratburn, the toughest, scariest teacher in school...  noin the whole world.  noin the whole history of the world.  oh, here comes the list.  let's go look.  arthur, we're in the rat's class.      arthur: maybe you read the list wrong.   you're right.  it's ratburn.  : ratburn...  ratburn...  ratburn...  ratburn...  ratburn...  ratburn...  ratburn...  ratburn...  ratburn...  ratburn...  ratburn...  ratburn...  ratburn...  ratburn.  free samples of a new flavorrocky rope.  all you can eat.  maybe he's not as rigorous as everyone says.  francine: prunella had him last year.  let's ask her.  is the rat bad.  does a bull fight.  he eats nails for breakfast without milk.   don't ever answer any questions wrong or he'll send you to death row.  death row.  ratburn: have you done your math exercises.  i did the first 5,000, sir.  then you have 9,995,000 left.  get to work.  and after that you have 37 million spelling words to memorize.  and you spiders, get moving.  and he's also a weird vampire with hypnotic magic powers.   : you are in my power.  all : we do not like recess.  well, good luck.   kids: oh, he's coming.     good morning, everyone.   welcome to grade three.  my name is mr. ratburn.  he doesn't look so bad.  it's probably a trick.  here's a twominute math quiz to see what you remember.  i said it was a trick.   boy: i love this.  . welcome to the first day of school .  . school is cool... .  ratburn: arthur readyou'd better concentrate on those problems before time's up.     class, you may now file out in an orderly fashion.  quietly.  no talking.  arthur read.  are you standing ratburn gave us homework on the first day.  get with it.  we're not dealing with a human being.  this is serious.  whoa. whoa.  you find it yet.  ratburn: hello, this is mr. ratburn.  shh.  ratburn: i have all the eyes i need but i'm completely out of heads.  i can wait for girls' heads but i must have boys' heads immediately.  wait, he'll see usand we have boys' heads.  there's no time.  i need them now.  i'll get them myself.    what are you doing.   ratburnhe's looking for body parts: heads, boys' heads.  a vampire doesn't need heads.  arthur: this is no ordinary vampire.  he's beyond vampire.  what's beyond a vampire.  a ratburn.   hey, what....  stand still.  he wants boy heads, not girls'.  breakfast.  what do you think he'll do with that saw.  i read a book where kids discovered a scary mystery like this and became detectives to solve it.  we should probably investigate.  we have a lot of homework to do.  you're just a fraidycat.  arthur, we have to choose: face horrifying, scary danger or do our homework.  both: horrifying, scary danger.    francine: i'm bored.  he's not doing anything weird.  you probably heard him talking about heads of lettuce.  boy heads of lettuce.  maybe grocers call the rotten ones that.  i'm going to do my homework.  arthur, look.  oh...   maybe we should go do our homework.  come on.  he went into the carnival.  of courselook at all those boy heads.  we've got to warn them.  oh, no. he's got us.  we're trapped.  there he goes.  come on.  he went in there.   okay, it was that one.  this is authentic, but i'd prefer a real action pose.   sorry, sir.  okay, i pick this time.   one... two... three...  go.   run away.  you're not safe.  he'll get you.   huh.  radio: hey, you're not in this story.  you're doing my lines.  i warn jack to run away when he hears, "fee, fi, fo..." you know the drill.   ratburn : arthur, buster.  get off the stage.  okay, fellaswhen you leave that castle, make a left down that beanstalk, and you'll be back in elwood city.   wow, the rat does kids' puppet shows.  jack, you're disorganized.  you'd forget your head if it wasn't attached.  uhuh, would not.  grab your head and hide.  here comes the giant.   arthur, look.  giant: fee, fi, fo, fum.  kids: ew, yuck.  ratburn: they always crack.  i must use 50 boy heads a year.  boy heads. boy heads.  i never have enough boy heads.  you make puppets.  can't talk, boys.  i have 40 seconds to get jack ready.  must stay on schedule because of all i do.  you do a lot.  you're a teacher, a coach you work on the school paper.  i can't even find time to do my homework.  learn to organize your time.  some people think i give a lot of homework.  both: not us.  learn good work habits and you'll discover...  jack, where are you.  : just a second.  you're capable of more than you think.  i'll teach you how to do that homework and have more free time.  like how you do all that stuff plus puppets.  exactlytwo seconds early.  selfdiscipline is as important to learn as two plus two.  : my head's on straight.  man, your head's on straight but your body is backwards.  please don't stand there.  i have to concentrate on my work.  oh, sorry.  boy, were we wrong.  boys, i can't wait to see your geography projects tomorrow.   kids: and now...  my teacher's name is mrs. erlandson.  mrs. erlandson.  kids told me she was mean.  i wasn't scared of her.  division in the second grade.  we can do it.  then i found out she was nice.  i thought she'd be mean, but she wasn't.  she had purple shoes.  child 2: purple dress.  child 3: purple earrings, purple shirt and purple shoes.  child 4: she had decorations on her dress.  child 5: she wears a bow every day on her hair.  child 6:

food.  she likes to eat mexican food.  she likes to teach.  she teaches kids.  and every time she counts to three everybody gets into their seats.  one...  two...  three.  fantastic.  she likes to sing.  . sandwiches are beautiful, sandwiches are fine .  . i like sandwiches, i eat them all the time.  .  she's the nicest teacher in the whole world.  and now...  do you think everybody gets nervous before doing something important to them.   girl: benjamin should you do this.  i have to.   ouch, ouch.  i did it.  ouch, ouch.  ouch.  hey, ouch.  this can't compare to a lightning storm so i shouldn't be afraid either.  haney: and nextarthur read.    good morning, mr. haney.  the allschool spellathon is coming up.  everybody competing.  the third grade has the best spellers.  it used
