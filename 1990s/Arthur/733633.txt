 this part of the story doesn't involve you.  ah, here it is.  the piece of the puzzle that started it all.  george's dad: now, once you've sanded both sides of the dovetail joint, you're going to apply a little...  george, would you see if you can find some more glue in one of the other classrooms.  george: cool space ship.  it's not a space ship.  it's the golden bullet x97, the fastest train in the world.  it can go 581 kilometers per hour.  really.  i never knew a train could go that fast.  it floats on a superpowerful magnet.  there's another really fast one in france called the gb17, but that one runs on wheels.  i have a picture of it.  however, this picture is not entirely accurate because i made the windows too big.  you drew that.  wow.  i'm george, by the way.  my name is carl.  i come here every tuesday and thursday with my mom.  she's getting me apple juice.  in a box, not a bottle.  i like drawing, too.  hey, maybe we could hang out sometime.  hang out of what.  no, i just meant...  wait.  you're pulling my leg.  no, i'm not.  i'm doing a puzzle.   that's pretty funny.   oh, sorry.  well, maybe i'll see you later.  i have to bring this to my dad.  nice meeting you.  bye.  now surrender quietly, remi, or i'll...  oh.  giving me the stinkeye, are you.  i'll show you.   wally, quit kidding around.  i need to clean up before bed.  kind of tastes like chicken.   no. george.  not your dirty pants.  anything but that.  hey, if that's money, i should get it.  i did all the work.  it's a piece of carl's puzzle.  it must have fallen in my pocket when i bumped into the table.  who's carl.  he's this kid i met today.  it was strange.  i couldn't tell if he liked me or not.  what's not to like.  you're nice, smart and you're a ventriloquist.  thanks, wally.  i should bring this back to him.  take me with you.  i've always wanted to go to your dad's woodworking class.  he could make me a friend.  a nice little ostrich.  we could share bowties.  hey, carl.  remember me.  you're george.  i met you tuesday.  you were getting a bottle of glue for your dad.  carl's mom: is this the boy you were telling me about.  nice to meet you, george.  i'm carl's mom.  could i have some apple juice, please.  in a box, not a bottle.  sure, sweetie.  i'll be right back.  you didn't have a backpack with you last time.  i like it.  blue's my favorite color.  mine, too.  hey, i'll bet you'll never guess what's inside.  hiya, carl.  i'm wally, george's dummy, although we prefer the term mannequin.  want to be friends.   carl, i'm right here.   there, there, sweetie.  it's all right.  what... what did i do wrong.  it's not your fault, george.  carl has asperger's syndrome.  sometimes he reacts this way to unfamiliar situations.  i... i didn't know.   is there anything i can do.  thanks, but not right no carl, it's okay, it's okay.  it's okay, carl.  okay... um... sorry.  george: all i did was show him wally and he got really upset.  his mom said it was because he had aspuh...  asperger's syndrome.  yeah, that was it.  my uncle has asperger's.  here's a picture of him.  "professor keith powers wins crown city physics prize." wow. is he a genius.  sort of.  but he has a lot of trouble being around other people.  why.  his brain just works differently.  what's normal to us can seem really strange to him.  he described it like this...  brain: imagine you've crashlanded on an alien planet.  it looks like earth, but there are lots of differences.   brain: for one, a lot of people seem to talk really loudly.  hey..  how ya doin'..  nice to meet you..  i'm francine..  brain: and even though you speak the same language, you sometimes have a hard time understanding what they mean.  good night for a banana fight, right.  um, yes.  no.  uh, i don't know.  brain: and things that seem hilarious to you...  aren't funny at all to them.  what's he laughing at..  is it my nose.  i have no idea.  you're weird.  but it was a joke, right.   brain: you wish the scientists back on earth had given you a guidebook to this strange planet, but they forgot to pack one.  so, you have to try to learn things all on your own.  maybe there's one thing in particular that captures your interest, and you study just that.   hopefully, the people on the planet begin to understand you a little better.  hey, george.  nice...  oops. sorry.  : nice painting.  thank you, arthur.  you look very creamy today.   brain: and you might even learn to fit in.  but you'll always feel a little bit different.  anyway, that's the way uncle keith explained it to me.  here's your smoothie.  wally: george, this is a bad idea.  why.  because you really upset carl last time.  no, i didn't. youdid.  oh, that's right.  blame the mannequin.  well, what's going to happen this time when he sees me.  he's not going to, wally.  you're staying home.  what..  but... but this is a new bowtie.  i even put on a fresh coat of furniture polish.  where is it.  where's the last piece.  just relax, sweetie, i'm sure it's around here somewhere.  it's gone.  it'll never be complete.  this is terrible.   we'll get you a new puzzle.  i promise.  oh, dear.  and it's all my fault.  carl: hello, george.  are you looking for more glue.  carl.  no. i came to give you this.  it fell into my pocket by accident.  i was going to give it to you the other day, but well...  it's from the front car of the golden bullet x97.  i noticed it was missing, so my mom and i made another piece like it.  however, this one will fit better.  oh, i brought you something else, too.  if it's a wooden giraffe, i don't want it.  don't worry.  it's just a book.  carl: central pacific number 2...  the trans iberian express...  carl, can you say thank you.  the dome car.  that's okay.  so, there you have it.  that's how carl and i became friends.  and a steam funnel...  and a signal whistle...  hey, carl, want to get some juice.  in a box, not a bottle.  okay.  it was nice to meet you.  i taught him that.  he taught me to speak quietly, be clear and not to take it personally if he ignores me.  now maybe he'll teach me how to draw a better lion.  and now...  bess: carl was a kid with asperger's.  he was very sensitive to certain things, and he worried a lot, and that reminds me of how i am sometimes.  linnea: if carl came to lovelane, i bet he would meet some new friends.  bess: this is lovelane special needs horseback riding program.  today, riding, we have ben, sean, linnea and daniel.  and me, bess.  walk.  bess: we all have some kind of asperger's or autism, which is a different way of how your brain works.  that's my friend sean.  that's my friend ben.  bess: there's a certain way you have to sit and a certain way you have to focus on the horse.  trot.  bess: well, it just kind of gives me kind of a connection with the horse.  i'm very personal with horses, and i think it's helpful for me.  the horse's name is jake.  linnea: i'm about to ride spike.  would you like to do an airplane arms trot.  yeah.  linnea: even though i have autism, i still go to my neighborhood school.  we're in happy hollow school.  this is second grade, and my teacher is ms.  niles.  we're writing stories.  you're going to take your story that you started yesterday and make an illustration for the first page.  linnea: it just is a little different.  like sometimes i need earmuffs because sometimes it's really loud.   they don't play music, though.  it helps me concentrate.  this is a sticker chart.  it helps you, like, concentrate and focus and stuff like that.  linnea is one of my best friends, actually.  we have a lot of fun joking around with each other.  you look like a d.j.  bess: people who have minds that work differently are really, really interesting people.  they matter just as much as everyone else.  and now...  arthur: even the nicest people in the world can lose control sometimes.  take brain, for instance.  you don't get much nicer than him... usually.   brain, give someone else a turn.  you've been hogging quark lord all day.  brain: just another thousand points.  i'm about to beat my own high score.   hey, guys, they're giving free pop...  whoa.  it's... not... possible.  oops. clumsy me.   popcorn.  no. uh, fruit roll.    all that fuss over a little game.   brain: six months of allowance down the drain.  pretty silly, huh.  d.w.: whoohoo. nice going, james.  we win again.  you were way ahead, but then i saw timmy behind me and i speeded up.  nothing like a tibble on your heels to really get you moving.  okay, that's it for today's practice.  now, everyone listen up.  i've got some exciting news for you.  d.w.: mom, guess what.  we're having a swim meet.  the trophy is as big as me, and i'm going to win it.  oh, really.  you sound pretty sure of yourself.  that's because i'm the fastest in the class.  except for james.  so i'm going to need lots of practice and a new swim suit and a new cap, and a shelf for my trophy.  oh, did i mention it was as big as me.  me..  but why do i have to take her to the pool.  i'm sorry, sweetheart, but your father and i are very busy and d.w. wants to get in some extra practice.  but mom...  all you have to do is keep an eye on her while she swims, like an extra lifeguard.  how difficult could it be.     very difficult.  arthur: d.w., you've been in there for an hour.  aren't you changed yet.  d.w.: i can't decide which swimsuit is fastest.  just pick one and get out here.  okay, but i think the other one was speedier.  it had stripes.  hey, look, it's james and molly.   why is she timing him.  i don't know.  maybe she's his coach.  coach.  james has a coach.  so.  "so".  i don't have a coach.  it's so unfair.  how can i win unless i have a coach.  ...  arthur, you have to be my swim coach.  me..  no way.  but that trophy is mine.   you want me to lose, probably because you never won a trophy as big as you.   oh, all right.  i'll be your coach.  yay.  okay, coach, what do i do first.  um... get in the water and swim.  that's it.  hmph.  you just can't get decent help these days.  arthur: hey.  you got roped into this too, huh.  yeah.  my mom made me do it.  sure hope no one sees me.  me neither.  d.w.: hey, watch where you're going.  you're in my lane.  james: am not.  d.w.: are too.  arthur: d.w., cut it out.  it's not worth fighting over.  hey, didn't you squirts ever hear about good sportsmanship.  get back to your practicing.  they shouldn't make little ki ce against each other.  yeah, competition's the pits.  swimming should just be for fun.  hey, did your sister just elbow my brother.  i don't think it was on purpose.  maybe he was out of his lane again.  he wasn't out of his lane.  well, d.w. didn't elbow him.  wait, what are we doing.  it'just a silly little kids' contest.   you're right. sorry.  kids.  arthur: d.w., this is taking all day.  does it have to be a mary moo cow swim cap.  how could you even ask.  you're my coach.  you should be supporting me.  hey, here we go.  great.  now can we leave.  soon as i find the matching ear plugs.  molly: over here.  try on this pair.  those look awfully big.  that's for extra speed.  you want to win, don't you.  i found them. they...  molly: let's get you some webbed gloves, like the pros use.  little bro, you're going to ace this race.  "competition is the pits," eh.  webbed gloves.  is he coming as a duck.  come on, d.w.  we're getting you a pair of those fins, too.  even better ones.  and some webbed gloves.  but i don't want gloves.  you want to win, don't you.  then we've got some serious shopping to do.  i just hope my allowance holds out.  .  d.w., wake up.  it's time for swimming practice.  wh....  arthur, it's still dark.  right, we can get in hours of extra practice before mol...  before anyone shows up at the pool.  let's get moving.  but i'm not finished with my dream.  uni was just about to show me where my snowball is.  d.w.: why do i have to wear all this stuff.  it's so heavy.  just put it on and get out here.  we've got a lot of practicing to do.  molly. arthur.  you're, uh, here early.  oh, i just came to, uh, test the water temperature.  how about you.  me.  oh, well, i, uh...  i was looking for my whistle.  you mean the one around your neck.  oh, there it is.   well, i'll be seeing you.  : hi, arthur.  uh, james.  what a surprise.  d.w.: okay, i'm ready to...  what was that.  what was what.  d.w.: arthur. this door is stuck.  uh, d.w..  did you follow me here.  well, since we're all here, might as well get in some swimming practice.  good idea.  practice time.    arthur: stroke. stroke.  stroke. stroke. stroke.  get those arms up. move those elbows.  keep your head down.  but i can't see where i'm going, and i'm tired.  d.w., if you want that trophy, you've got to practice every minute, not just when you're swimming.  buster: you know, some professional swimmers put grease all over their bodies.  ewww.  don't even think of it.  never mind him.  come on, d.w., let's see those arms move.  stroke. stroke. stroke. stroke. stroke arthur's got me swimming so much, my fingers are pruney all the time.  what.  oh, wait.  forgot to take my earplugs out from this morning's practice.  boy, i'll be glad tomorrow when this race is over.  me too.  well, i'd wish you good luck, but i'm supposed to want to win.  so, uh, good luck to me.  yeah, good luck to me, too.  ms. albright: all right, children, we're ready to begin the race.  line up at your starting positions.  remember: head down, arms up, and point your toes.  you've got to win this or i'll never be able to show my face again.  now just relax and have fun with it.  and don't forget your flutter kicks.  are your goggles on straight.  did you tighten your fins.  check.  and doublecheck.  great.  now remember, squirt, you're a mcdonald.  and mcdonalds don't lose.  understand.  well, here goes.  may the best man win.  or girl.  not that it matters.  right, right.  it's just for fun.  ms. albright: on your mark, get set... go.   head down, head down.  flutter kick.   buster: d.w. and james are pulling ahead of the others.  d.w.'s moving out in front.  no, wait. now james is in the lead.  faster, d.w.. faster. go. go.  buster: james's swim fin got caught on a lane marker.  molly: james. just take the fin off.  buster: that's going to cost him.  arthur: d.w., what are you doing..  don't help him.  buster: and the winner is... emily, whose last name i don't know.  whew. that was exhausting.  why'd you stop.  james needed help.  he was stuck.  but you could have won.  only because james didn't tighten his flipper.  like i told him to.  sorry.  here you go, james and d.w.  you both tied for second place.  congratulations.  here. you keep it.  you're the one who seems to want it so badly.  yeah. come on, d.w.  let's do a few more laps.   i feel like i just won an award for jerk of the year.  no, you didn't win.  we tied.  hey, did d.w. just elbow james.  no wa....  gotcha.  come on, let's go see who can buy their younger sibling the bigger banana split.  hi, everyone, it's me, buster.  if you
