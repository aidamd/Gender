 uhoh.  i can't find it.   it must be here, i just had it.   no.  barnes, don't do it.    oh, no.  our secret is out.  arthur, i'm going to do those windows as soon as you're finished cleaning your...  arthur.  arthur, i asked you to clean your room before you went out to play.  i'll do it later, i promise.  and did you give pal his bath.    i'll do that later, too.  i've got to go.  binky's counting on me.  18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11 ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four three, two, one.  okay, ready or not.   what's going on, binky.  we hid for 20 minutes.  you didn't even try to find us.  i thought you were supposed to hide and then seekme.  i don't believe it.  binky, how could you not know how to play hideandseek.  fooled you.   they don't call me king of hideandseek for nothing.    hey, stop tickling.  nobody's tickling you.  somebody's touching my back.   hey, a snake.  cool.  brain: interesting specimen.  he seems lost.  maybe he's just hungry.  let's take him to the sugar bowl then we can all eat.  i don't think cheeseburgers are part of his diet.   if he's lost, he'll be stuck out in the rain.  someone should take him home.  i don't think so.  not me, my mom and dad saw enough snakes in the amazon to last a lifetime.  after that porcupine incident i can't bring pets in the house.  then i guess i'll take him.  are you sure your mom and dad will let you keep a snake.  well, they never said i couldn't.  besides, look at himhe wouldn't hurt a fly.  d.w.: what's that.  ah.  oh, it's just a toy... for pal.  let me see.  no... i mean, it's a surprise.  hmm.   i'm done, can i go.  you cannot go anywhere until you clean your room and give pal his bath.  i was just going up to my room.  good boy, get that work done.   speaking of pet care what would happen if a small animal like, say, a snake, just happened to...  follow me home.  could i keep it.  a snake.  of course not.  what if it were lost.  arthur, stop stallingyou've got a room to clean.   i'll get it.  sue ellen: can we come in.  it's important.  just for a minutei have to clean my room.  you have to take the snake out of here.  we know.  it might be dangerous.  dangerous..   according to my reptile guide we may have found a poisonous coral snake.  remember that rhyme.  "red band near black, venom lack.  red band near yellow, bite a fellow." i say the red bands were near black.  i say yellow.  wow, we'd better check it.  dad: hello, everyone.  kids: uh, hello.  arthur, you have work to do.  you can't play now.  they're not staying.  just have to get something upstairs.  oh, no.  the red bands were near black, right.  i knew it. it's dangerous.  worse than that... it's gone.   i'm scared that i might step on it.  come on, guys, we have to find it.  how.  look at this mess.  it could be anywhere.   see.  nothing to it.  whew.   listen to them playing.  i'll have a serious talk with that boy about handling his responsibilities.  arthur.  it's time for your friends to go home now.  you promised to clean this...  huh.  all clean.   uh, well...  very good.  whoa.  what's wrong, binky.  i... we... that book is on the wrong shelf.   i thought we were in trouble for a second.  weare in trouble.  the snake is loose in the house.    think of it as a game.  whoever finds the snake wins.  i forfeit.  binky, bustergo downstairs.  we'll cover this floor.  hey, i think i got it.  don't forget, it may be venomous.   pal, it's just d.w.'s jump rope.   if you were a snake, where would you go.  they're attracted to water...   a sea serpent.  a sea serpent.   arthur: ah. the power's out.  oh, sorry, i leaned on the switch.  there it is.  brain.  sorry.  dad: so they helped him clean.  what's suspicious about that.  would you clean one of your friends' rooms, even now.  there's a sea serpent in the bath tub.  okay, what's going on.  hi.  d.w. left, so we're washing pal.  why waste water.   hmm.  sue ellen: there.  we shouldn't go in thereit's my mom and dad's room.  you want them to find the snake.  good point.  brain: snakes like baskets and boxes are kind of like baskets.  we have to search them all.  looking for something.  kids: ah.  um... did you want us to carry these boxes downstairs.  if you don't mind.  that'd be very... helpful.   oh, no.  well, it's not in the fridge.  what happened.  it's down here.  everyone split up.  dad: awww.   the picture on this tv is getting worse.    hey, you fixed it.   dad: awww.  i knew i saw a sea serpent.  i'm telling.  d.w., if you help me i'll read you that book about the frog every night for a month.  you got a deal, brother.   not now, pal.   i don't like you kids playing hideandseek in the house.  and please take that snake out of pal's dish.  snake..  kids: where..  brain: look, his red bands are near his black ones.  he's not dangerous.  see, told you.  hey, nicelooking king snake.  i saw these around here when i was your age.  because of his coloring some people confuse him with the very dangerous coral snake.  how'd he get in here.  well...  think we should let him loose here.  dad said to let it go where we found it.  but we found it in your shirt.  buster: there goes the greatest hideandseek player the world ever knew.  want to finish that game of hideandseek.  only if you swear not to pull out a snake just when you're losing.  never again.  i'm it.   ..  kids: and now...  today we went on a nature walk.  man: i'd like to welcome all of you to caratunk wildlife refuge.  does anybody know what it means that this is a wildlife refuge.  it's where animals are safe and so are plants.  we're starting a new fashion today.  i want you to pull your socks up on the outside of your pants.  guide 2: why did we put our socks over our pants.  so nothing gets inside.  what could that "something" be.  ticks.  guide 2: ticks, exactly.  guide 1: everybody look out in the field here.  there's a bird.  it's a small bird.  it's called a swallow.  they eat bugs.  kids: goose.  somebody knows what it is already.  it's called a canada goose and there should be a mate nearby.  canada geese mate for life.   we're going to give you guys a few minutes to do some exploring on your own.  guide 2: a lot of times you'll find salamanders hiding under logs.  here's one right here.  it's a redbacked salamander.  they like nice, dark, wet places.  girl: look what we found.  we have a boa constrictor.   boas are from south america and central america.  what makes up his body.  kids: scales.  you can see up close that his body has thousands of scales.  i like nature.  kids: bye.  and now...   hi. can't stop.  going to muffy's.  the most perfect best friends i know are francine and muffy.  arthur: they're always happy for each other.  i got it.  oh. hooray.  got what.  my acceptance to soccer camp.  that's so great, francine.  you're my best friend and i just had to tell you first.  something great happened to me, too.  what.  lame whoostle shoes.  oh, that's so great, muffy.  and they like to do everything together.  we need to celebrate.  what should we do.  play soccer. go shopping.  both :..  great.  ithoughtthey were perfect best friends...  muffy: i think we made the perfect compromise.  a few hours of shopping, a little soccer and then back to my place for the annual q.v.c. makeup and jewelry awards.  yeah, it looks like we've got a whole half hour of sunlight left.  oh, that's perfect, francine.  this way we missed the heat of the day.  muffy, ready whenever you...   what is it..  a snake..  it came right off my foot.  there's a lawsuit in this somewhere.   daddy, shoe emergencysoccer field.  maybe i should let you practice alone so i can tell cook what hors d'oeuvres to make for your party.   it's going to be so much fun tonight.    great.  jenna: oh, no, watch out.  oh, hi, jenna.  sorry, i got carried away with my kicking.  it's harwhen i have body to practice with.   muffy: poor francine.  she missed the awards for best designer logo on a belt buckle and the salute to fake eyelashes.   i'll get it.  oh, it's just the entertainment.  come in.   i wonder if she's sick.  catherine: so he said, "you're impossible" and then i said, "you're impossible" and then he said...   ignore that. i hate callwaiting.   i'm just going to keep redialing until i get through.  here...     and the phone was busy all night and she never came.  maybe she just doesn't care all that much about makeup and jewelry.  that couldn't be it.  she's always done whatever i wanted before.  i knowafter you left the soccer field a spaceship came down...  francine : and they kidnapped francine.  buster: no, their laser beam malfunctioned...  and accidentally whacked the soccer ball into francine's head, and gave her amnesia.  muffy... who.   hmm... well, you know i've always thought soccer was dangerous.  francine: ...remember the way he kicked the ball.  francine.  oh, hi, muffy.  sorry, i didn't...   your party.  i'm so sorry.  i totally forgot.  how could you possibly forget.  i won't say i told you so.    hey, francine.  what did you want to talk to me...  binky, how rude.  can't you see i'm shouting.  hey, francine.  you want a ride home.  oh, that's, um...  i'll wait in the car, francine.  hey, what's going on here, francine.  well...  and how did you just forget last night.  i set up the whole awards show party just for you.  i know.  well, we were playing soccer and then jenna said she had the new soccer bloopers video...  what..  i said i was sorry.  you never asked me if i wanted to watch the awards and it was my day to celebrate and if i'm going to soccer camp i need to practice.  well, i... i can play soccer.  i can.  i just had a shoe emergency.  you saw.  okay, if you want to play.  i do.  i did it.  i'm walking the...  girls.   okay, you guys, i'm ready now.  aah.  i got it.  come on, muffy.  okay, i...   francine: over herei got it.  look out.    okay, that was a great workout.  now let's do something fun.  what do you mean.  thisisfun.  maybe i should just find a best friend who wants to do the thingsi like to do.  go ahead, i'm not stopping you.   well, maybe i will.  well, maybe you should.  well, maybe i...  jenna: watch out.   you're trying to give me amnesia.  okay, brain, before i play with you i have to ask a few questions.  question number onedid you think it was fair when diamonds lost to emeralds in the q.v.c. jewelry awards.  um...  correct.  i was undecided, too.  question twowhat goes best with silver lame shoes.  uh...  a black chenille gown with red vinyl belt and matching socks.  i never thought of that.  oh, brain, i'm so excited.  this is going to be a great friendship.  okay, here's the last question.  don't worry, it's an easy one.  which is more important: fashion or soccer.  muffy: sorry...  i really thought you were going to pass.  so this is what failing feels like.  fascinating.  no, i don't like soccer...  perfect.  as much as i like tae kwon do.   i feel like shopping is a waste of time better spent reading poetry.  oh, neat, i have a test, too.  what is the best thing to do when leo is rising from the house of capricorn.  muffy: congratulations, buster.  you're the first person to pass the oral exam.  now it's on to the shopping test.  that includes lunch, right.  of course, that's where we compare our purchases.   oh, look.  how adorable.  what do you think.  aah.  clothes... everywhere...  can't... breathe...   buster..   toys...   better now.  i must say, you're the only candidate who's passed every test.  you love spending money and you have a refreshing lack of tolerance for other people's stupidity.  you're just about perfect in every way...  this french fry is underfried.  i demand a refund.  mom: time to go, d.w.  thanks for watching her while i was shopping, muffy.  if only you didn't have to take naps.  only one name left.  i've got to make this one work out.  muffy: i can finally go on this ride without spinning it.  francine always spun it as fast as she could and it made me sick.  are you as bored as i am.   you want to see 5,000 explosions and a supernova.  nah, francine said it's too talky.  okay, how about slobbering idiots.  look. let's go to this one.  francine loved kickball kids.  muffy: and that part where the girl kicked the ball into the sphinx and made it burpwasn't that something francine would do.  are we going to shop or talk about francine.  binky: all right, this is way better.  who gets to kick off first.  nobody, i guess.  nobody.  what kind of a game is that.  there's jenna.  maybe we can play doubles.  hi, jenna.  where's francine.  oh, she got weird today and went to the mall.  she did..  yeah. you guys want to play.  yeah.  thanks, maybe later.  i thought we were going to play.  you guys go ahead without me.  muffy: hi.  muffy.  you're shopping..  i'm not shopping i was just looking for, um... uh...  me, too.  look, i was thinking it's okay if you don't like to play soccer.  and you don't have to shop with me.  best friends don't have to be with each other 24 hours a day.  right.  hey, let's celebrate.  what should we do.  um...  uh...  both: go...  swimming.   both: yeah.  huh.  binky:don't tell muffy but i think you're kind ofmore fun to play with.  jenna:you're fun, too.  hey, you want to seeslobbering idiots.  who wouldn't..  hi, everyone.it's me, buster.  when i travel with my dad, i sure miss
