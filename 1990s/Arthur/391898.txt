 song "london bridge is falling down," pretty easy.  see if you can name this one.   if you don't recognize it, it's because i made it up.  i hoped it would be famous, but...   it needed somethinga weird, pesky something...   hi.  dad: on a morning like this, you kids need an oatmeal that'll stick to your ribs.  tadah.  a healthy portion for mom...  hmm, the baking soda must have reacted with the molasses.  looks like we'll have storebought cereal.  arthur, would you...  sure, mom.  the only thing you'll get from that stuff is a mouthful of cavities.  d.w.: wow.  and i thought letters only came in alphabet soup.  "the crunch cereal jingle contest." wow.  that's a prize.  "and your jingle will also be aired on tv with the new crunch cereal commercial." on tv. cool.  "include 20 box tops with each entry." keep eating.  crunch, crunch, crunch.  maybe you should try to think of a word that rhymes with "crunch." i'm waiting for an idea.  "dense" sort of rhymes with "crunch." you can't just think of rhymes, d.w.  a jingle is the perfect words with the perfect melody.  you're too young to understand great art.  hey. how about lunch.  lunch.   mom.  too sad.  too silly.  hmm, i guess it will do.  snowball fight. fourth graders captured francine.  they're giving her the powdered doughnut treatment.  come on.   duck.  this way.  how's that jingle coming.  i've pretty much finished the words.  it goes:.. crunch." i like it.  but no matter what i do i can't think of a tune.  you know, you need a band.  maybe you're right.  all i need to do is...  you need to stand still so i can pulverize you.  francine, we were looking all over for you.  because you two spent all your time yakking i got the creampuff and powdereddoughnut...  want to be the drummer in my band.  a band.  sure.  i guess i should have taken lessons.  arthur: next.      grandma: . grandma's got a brandnew hat .  . gonna groove it all night long. .  both: cool...  "solo for clarinet" by some old, dead dudekoechel listing number 417.   wow, binky, that was beautiful.  want to make something of it.  i think we have our band.   i want it to start off with a bang.  everyone should play a really loud note...  what if....  does someone have a question.  i didn't see anybody raise their hand.  yes, francine.  i thought it might be nice to start with a drum roll.  hmm... i don't think so.  yeah...  then we come in with the strings.   and then we'll add the horns.    arthur: no. no. no.  stop.  i've got the entry form.  i've eaten 15 boxes of crunch and this ismyjingle so we're going to play itmyway.  any questions.   maybe that was too much of a bang.  but it's a good start.  what was that noise.  it could be heard for miles.  sorry, we'll try to keep it down.  we're rehearsing a jingle.  hey, wait.  where are you going.  maybe we should come back when you have an actual tune.  it is kind of hard on the ears.  wait, we'll come up with a tune.  that's why you're here.  come on, arthur, i'll buy you a milk shake.  no thanks, i have work to do.  you should give it a rest.  did mozart give it a rest.  did the guy who wrote nursery rhymes give it a rest.  i don't think so, buster.  eat crunch.  i'll never come up with anything.   stay still, nadine.   . oh, i have a hunch breakfast, dinner and lunch .  . would be so fun to munch .  . if i had it with nadine. .  that's it. it's perfect.  perfect.  he's lost his cookies, nadine.  hmm, too much of that cereal.  i've got it, buster.  i've got the jingle.  listen to this.  arthur: . oh, i have a hunch breakfast, dinner and lunch .  . would be so fun to munch if i had it with crunch. .  buster: that was fantastic.  how did you think of it.  i was in the living room and i heard it...  yeah, so.  in my head... and then the words just came to me, that's all.  wow, i guess that's how a great jingle is born.  nothing, nothing, and then, poofout of nowhere, something beautiful.  i got to go mail this, the deadline is tomorrow.  oh.  watch it, you maniac.  you want to end up a road kill.  uh, sorry, d.w.  nadine and i were talking about you.  and we've decided you should eat more fruit.  here.  thanks.  uh... i have to go.  oh, is that the jingle for the contest.  this.  oh, yes, i suppose it is.  so. let's hear it.  oh, munch crunch, snap, pop, fizz...  something like that.  got to run.     d.w.: arthur, arthur.  .  d.w.: arthur, over here.  d.w., where are you.  art...  d.w.. d.w., are you all right.  here...  announcer: the bionic bunny show...   we'll be right back after these messages.    . oh, i have a hunch... .   . ...do much fun to munch .  . if i had it with... crunch. .  this commercial isn't as good as the other.  d.w., i can explain.  get away from the tv.  breakfast is ready, kids.  dad: you're going to love this stuff.  one bowl and you won't be hungry till dinner.   is this the read residence.  yes.   on behalf of crunch cereal i present you with a year's supply of crunch cereal.  and a certificate to the winner of the jingle contest miss d.w. read.  me.  arthur: ...and i realized i had to put your name on it since it was your song.  i was going to tell you, but i was waiting for the right time.  you sent that crummy thing in.  i have much better songs than that.  oh, right... like.  like the one i wrote this morning.  . oh, everyone thinks that my brother stinks .  . like a piece of yellow cheese .  . but me, i say that he's okay as long as there's a breeze. .  mom.  kids: and now...  we're making commercials.  all: tres...  dos...  uno... accion.  boy: hola, amor.  hola, amor.  que el bebe esta comiendo.  wow. crunch cereal.  me gusta esto.  chorus: vamos a comer, vamos a comer el crunch cereal.  first you think of what the commercial will be about.  then you think of what you want to say, and write it down.  woman: if the song and the lyrics say something good people will buy it, no matter how bad the cereal is.  : hi, this is mrs. crunch talking about the crunch cereal.  we were in the hallway practicing our commercial...  we have four different flavors.  apple...  grape...  strawberry...  and orange.  teacher: like this: "strawberry." four different flavors: apple, grape, strawberry.  apple, grape, strawberry and orange.  strawberry...  and orange.  everyone goes "crunch cereal." then natalie grabs it and then...  three...  two...  one... action.  hi, this is the crunch cereal...   the best cereal in the whole wide world.  we have four different flavors: apple..  grape...  strawberry...  orange.  we hope you enjoy it.  it's low in fat and never gets soggy.  it's the best.  all: crunch cereal.  kids: and now...  d.w.: oh, yeah.  well, you just watch.  wait, d.w.   look, she's going to do it.  one, two, three.  one, two, three.  but d.w., you could really get hurt.   okay, lift me up.   if you don't make it, d.w.  can we have your toys.  she's too scared to do it.  whoa...  yeah...  she's going to chicken out.  whoa.  am not.  whoa.  faster than a speeding bullet...  tadah.  announcer: the bulgarians take the turn at 55 miles an hour.  i wouldn't want to fall off that bob.  cool. that's as fast as a car.  big deal.  anybody can ride a sled.    d.w.: oh, pretty horsey.  put the olympics back on.  no way. sports are boring.  are not.  are, too.    announcer: a perfect combo on the balance beam.  tina traolina will win a gold medal.  wow.  mom.  here we go again.  d.w.: when i win the gold medal i'll do cereal commercials.  i don't know, d.w.  please, mom.  i'll be so rich you and dad will never work again.  d.w., remember when you said you wanted to play tball more than anything.  i can only hit balls that move.  and when you wanted to be a ballerina.  i have weak knees.  and how about the violin lessons.    i could have been really good without that stick.  you wanted to do those things, but not to practice.  why is this any different.  because ireally want to do this one.  besides, mom, i'm already good at jumping.   all right.  huh.  oh, thank you, mom.    the tibbles.  hide me.  i'm sure your teacher can handle them.    humph.  it's emily with her nanny.  i'm in the same class with miss perfect.  now, d.w., just because she's smart, pretty and very polite doesn't mean she's perfect.  a tout a l'heure, renee.  mom: well, it's time to start.  i'll be waiting.  don't try anything too fancy, okay.   announcer: there's the pinwheel flip, with a frogkick followthrough and a havingtea dismount.  amazing.   announcer: well, bob, we'll soon seethatface on a box of crunch cereal.  yup, but let's not forget the runnersup: emily... what'shername, not quite perfect gets the silver medal and timmy and tommy tibble receive the bronze although everyone knows they should have been disqualified.    off that balance beam, young lady.  this is not for beginners.  we won't be using it for a year.  a year.  i can't wait that long.  i'll be old by then.  you'd better start practicing right away.  we'll start with a somersault.  then you tuck your head and roll.  and that's the somersault.  everyone find a partner.  be my partner.  i guess so.   good, but next time grab your knees.  then you'll end up on your feet.  for your information, that was a "halfsault." you're supposed to end up on your back.  your turn.  all wrongyou didn't jump high enough.  the roll was too slow, and you didn't smile at the end.  emily, lovely.  keep up the good work.  d.w., next time, hold the knees.  i guess she didn't know you were doing a halfsault.    excellent posture.  d.w., try to keep your back straight like emily's.  you think she'll teach us how to stand on the ceiling like that.  whoa.   when you finish the cartwheel bring your feet together.  it takes practice to get it right.  all right, edwin.  ready.    a brave attempt, edwin.  try to break the fall with your hands.  next.  emily: one, two, three.  one, two, three.  humph.  why bother.  where are you going, d.w..  i bet i know whereshe'sgoing.  she's going to her mommy.  yeah, she's afraid of doing a cartwheel.  i am not.  i was just going to...  teacher: well, miss read.   not bad, but do try to stay on the mat.   next.  d.w.: mommy, look at me.  look at me.  are you watching me, mommy.  just a sec, d.w.  okay, let's see it.  don't watch.  it's not ready yet.  d.w.: whoa.   oh, my gosh.   man on p.a.: spill, aisle five.   aislesix.   aisle seven.   .  one, two, three.  one, two, three.  all right, children, form a line.  it's cartwheel time.   now, remember, look before you leap.  go.  better, edwin, but two hands are better than one.  next.  i did it.  i did it.  very nice, d.w.  legs together on your finish.   thank you, really.  thank you.  thank you very much.   emilyshowing off is very impolite.  it's not fair.  emily: i'm sorry i showed off, d.w.  d.w.: i could have done better but i didn't want to.  cartwheels are for babies.  well, i think they're kind of hard.  d.w.: not as hard as doing one on the balance beam.  bet you can't do that.  neither can you.  oh, yeah.  well, you just watch.  wait, d.w.   look, she's going to do it.  one, two, three.  one, two, three.  but d.w., you could really get hurt.   okay, lift me up.   if you don't make it, d.w.  can we have your toys.  she's too scared to do it.  whoa...  yeah.  she's going to chicken out.  whoa.  am not.    what were you doing.  oh, mom, i was just doing a cartwheel.  we'll discuss this on the way home, young lady.  now, go put your shoes on.  : miss perfect goody twoshoes told the teacher so she wouldn't lose.  hey, leave her alone.  her.  but she spoiled your cartwheel.  maybe you two would like to do a cartwheel on the balance beam.   did you hear something.  i hear grandma calling us.  got to gobye.  thanks, d.w., you're a real friend.  well, after all, you did save my life.  maybe... maybe you could teach me how to do a really good cartwheel.  sure, but it takes a lot of practice.  d.w.: i'll practice if you promise not to be so perfect.  it's a deal.  you could have hurt yourself.   d.w., are you listening.  i'm listening.  i'll be careful.  good.  mommy.  no, d.w., you're too young to take riding lessons.  yippie.  oh, please, mommy.  i'll be really careful.  please.  please.  please.   there's a place on the web just for you and it's called pbs kids go dot org.  and when
