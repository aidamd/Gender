 . for that's the place to start .  . and i say hey. .  hey.  . what a wonderful kind of day .  . if we could learn to work and play .  . and get along with each other. .  hey.  . what a wonderful kind of day .  . hey. what a wonderful kind of day. .  hey.  arthur: hey, d.w.  hey.  whoa.   during spring vacation, we get a week off from school and we go to the community center for day camp.  we do lots of fun, new stuff.  our group did shakespeare.  ratburn: macbeth finds the witches in their lair.  macbeth, you're scared.  witches, you're scary.  bubble, bubble, toil and trouble.  buster's group collected cool, ancient things.  "a look at...  : antiquities." kids: ooh.    kids: ooh.  ah.  arthur: prunella was in the group that did clay sculpture.    how did i end up in this group.  and wait until you see what my group is doing next.   oh, no. not that.       you'll make musical instruments out of all this.  sue ellen says it'll be easy.  our group will have the best project.  thanks, dad.   what's that sound.  stuff to make musical instruments.  you're lucky to be in a good group.  sue ellen likes to do cool stuff.  buster and i want to make a futuristic suit of armor next but muffy and jenna want to weave baskets.  bleah. bleah. bleah.  sue ellen: wait till you see how to make instruments.  : i think it might be good if we read a poem while we play the instruments.  no one would hear it over the music.  oh. i guess you're right.  okay, here's the stuff from my dad.  i've made my own home versions of each of these.  it's really easy.     hey, this isn't my stuff.  these are katherine's.  we took each other's backpacks.  what's this.  popular girl.  girls: ooh.  this is a teenage girl's magazine.  they have all sorts of strange and mysterious articles.  "get a prom date in 12 days or less." what's a prom.  muffy: are you reading popular girl.  not me.  i can't wait till i'm old enough so i can do everything they say.  then i'll be just like that model.   hey, is that popular science.  oh. never mind.  look, here's a quiz.  "how likable are you." let's take it.  these tests are scientific.  arthur: we don't need some dopey test to tellusif people like us.  come on, guys.  question one"if you were a sandwich "your friends would be: 'a,' potato chips. 'b,' diet soda. 'c,' the plate. 'd,' hungry." " " if we end up eating our friends do we fail the test.  francine: 'a,' going to a big party. 'b,' going shopping. 'c,' going to the library. 'd,' going to the kitchen." i like these tests.  question 20...   whoa.   well, that's the end of that.  that test was weird.  who thinks of their friends as chips.  it's for teenagers.  they think differently.  it's kind of scary.  sometimes i look at katherine and her friends and think about being their age.  i can't fall asleep for hours.  sue ellen: what are you doing.  i kind of wanted to see how likable i am.  aren't you curious.  no.  well, maybe a little.  seven, eight, nine, ten, 11...  i scored 12.  "if you scored less than 20 "you are too quiet.  "nobody can like you because nobody knows you're there." it's my worst nightmare.  binky, buster, muffy...  where is fern.  she's been absent for days.  fern: here i am.  i'm going to have to call her parents.   fern: this is so depressing.  "the solution. be strong.  "say what's on your mind whether anyone wants to hear you or not." my turn.  i scored 125.  "if you scored over 100..." you scored way over 100.  "you are too good to be true.  "you frighten people with your excellence.  tone it down." you are good at everything, sue ellen.    yeah.  oh, what's the point.  i'll never be as good as sue ellen.   i'm frightened by her excellence.  i might as well stick my tongue in a drawer and never blow again.  but i don't get it.  we have friends.  why do they like us.  well, this magazine is for teenagers so it must be predicting the futureour future.   we have to change now or we'll be friendless for the rest of our lives.  this morning we focus on karate.  let's have a demonstration from our expert, sue ellen.  expert. me.  i'm only average...  or less.  buster, step up.  me. against her.  well... okay.     i flipped sue ellen.  wow. i flipped sue ellen.  i must be good.  see. it's working.  if he can do that, i can do that.  : oh.   this victory feels... hollow.  but don't you feel good.  you weren't even trying.   try me.  huh.    you flipped sue ellen, but fern flipped you.  it feels like the world's turned upside down.  it's working.  everyone's staring.  that means we're likable.  i hope you're right.  i'm sore all over.  hmm.  there's sue ellen.  she'll know.  our group is weaving a futuristic nonrippable fabric.  you were in belgium.  do you know looming techniques.  well, what i saw...   oh. um... no.  any ideas you have will be much better than mine.  silver.  : please.  go with red.  what's with them.  you heard sue ellen.  our ideas are best, so do what i say.  sue ellen, weren't you going to show us how to make idiot phones.  "idiophones"....  i mean, that's what i thought the word was.  i'm probably wrong.    is this right.  uh... yes.  excellent.   ow.  : okay, potato chips i've decided i'm reading a poem.  you can accompany me.  wait. when did we decide that.  fern: you didn't.  this group needs leadership.  i'm taking charge.  we don't need a leader.  right, sue ellen.  well, um...  we have agreed that she has no opinion on this.  if you want to boss people around find your own group.  this used to be fun.  do you think i was strong enough.  oh, yes.  they definitely know you're there now.  this is working out well, isn't it.  who does that fern think she is, anyway.    aah, get this stuff off me.  this is sue ellen's fault.  we ask for a little help and she sabotaged us.  whoa.   binky, move.  we have to finish our trojan horse.  binky: why did she do it. why.  i don't understand.  : sue ellen wasn't making fun of you.  get up and help.  she faked a fall.  she doesn't even think i'm worth flipping anymore.    we're so good at being likable everyone hates us.  we followed what it said.  how come we're not like this.  you did all this because of that stupid magazine.  it said we weren't likable.  answering that your friends are diet soda would throw off your score.  that magazine is just goofy.  so i'm not too quiet.  and i'm too good.  all: no.   now, will you please come in so we can do our project right.    what.  whoa.   huh.  : let's finish this horse.  how can we split this up.  it won't cut.  success.   greeks rule and trojans drool.   i can't believe we acted so dumb.  i like being good at what i do.  and i can't stand telling people what to do.  how could anyone take a silly test like that seriously.  ratburn: "if you scored over 200..." oh, i have a lot of work to do.  according to this, i don't give out enough homework.  kids: and now...  coffee cans...   boxes...   bottle caps...   pie plates...  milk cartons...   nails...  and wood.  we're making musical instruments.  boy: out of normal everyday things.  you can make a musical instrument anytime.       going to have a nice jam session here.                     all: music.  and now...  everybody's gotten really upset by something at least once.  like the time d.w. lost her blankie or when d.w. lost her c.d. of "crazy bus" or when d.w. lost her snowball.   okay, maybe d.w. is upset more than most people.  bad example.  a good example is francinethat time she hit a high fly with three men on baseit looked like a grand slam and she'd won the game for us.  then the wind shifted.  yay.  she was really upset.  i can't believe this... ugh.  and when the brain got so excited about the space probe headed for saturn.  is something wrong, brain.  the probe won't get to saturn for seven years.  how can i stand waiting seven years to see photos of saturn.  but i know one person who's always happy.  he's never been upset for more than three secondsbuster baxter the happiest, jolliest, most fun...  what's wrong.  hmph.  what is it.  buster..  if i don't get free, i won't be able to deliver aunt bob's medicine in time.  buster, did you write your report before watching tv.  yeah... almost... well, actually, no.  you know our homework policy.  okay.  aw. how'd he get out.  buster: how did bionic bunny get free.  i was busy working on my history report.  mine's kind of weak.  i... i did it sort of fast afterbionic bunny.  but i wrote a great joke for it.  for your history report.  yeahon tv, this ad said that the difference between a successful speech and a failure is to start with a joke.  i wish i had someone to try it out on.  binky, can i try a joke on you.  sure, i like to laugh as much as the next guy.  : oh, dear... oh, my... oh...  okay, the guy after the next guy.  ready.  what did king tut say when he got scared.  "i want my mummy."  you made that up.  good one.  this is going to be my best report everguaranteed "a." do you want a joke for your report.  no, thanks.  are you sure.  i could help you get an "a," too.  binky: christopher columbus got lost, but did something great anyway.  that's why he's my favorite historical figure.  i'm next.  wish me luck.  oh, you know what king tut said when the sphinx scared him.   "i want my mummy."  he told my joke.  i can't believe... i... he...  it... my... he... he told my joke.  quiet, please.  mr. baxter please read your report.  it was mine... my joke... he told my joke.  uhoh...  buster: uh... my report is about king tut.  hey, what do you call two banana peels.  class : a pair of slippers.  francine: my sister can take us skating tomorrow.  he told my joke.  that was mine.  i made it up.  binky shouldn't have.  he was wrong to do it.  so, want to go skating tomorrow.  he told my joke.  you'll have to work a little harder next time.    no matter how fancy you make a "d" it's still a "d." "d" for "disaster." "d" for "deadly." "d" for "binky told my joke".  buster: that joke was the difference between a success and a flop just like the tv said.  i win again.  are you paying attention.  it wasmyjoke.   binky's report was about columbus.  : who ends a columbus report with a joke about king tut..  : binky does.  now, shh.   i just found out ratburn gave binky a bplus.  "i want my mummy."  i was going to give you an "f," but that joke...  you deserve a higher grade.  my joke got him that bplus.  ow.  great shot, buster.  aren't you happy you won the game for us.  binky told my joke.  why do you keep tellingus.  talk to binky about it.  you think i won't.  just watch me.  hey, binky.  yeah.   did you tell him.  have you ever noticed how large he is.  i'll never get payback for that joke.  whoa.   oh, i feel better already.  now he'll know how it feels to be embarrassed.    what's wrong.  everyone's laughing just like when he told the joke.  everyone thinks binky's funny.  so what if people think binky's funny.  binky doesn't care about funny.  it'smewho cares about funny.  it'smewho memorizes joke books and practices making faces in the mirror.  i have to work at it.  you know how long i worked on that king tut joke.  longer than on your report.  yeah, but binky...  : haven't you noticed that anything he does seems kind of...  funny.  you're wasting time thinking about binky.  it won't matter after the talent show tomorrow.  i'll show him.  he'll be sorry he stole my joke.   hiyah.    ratburn: thank you sue ellen, for that demonstration of pumpkin kicking.  and now the comedy stylings of buster baxter.  at least while he's telling jokes he won't talk about binky.  i think he's gotten over it.  hi, everyone.  there's a kid in my class named binky barnes.  both: oh, no.  nobody has a bad thing to say about binky because they don't want to get pounded.  binky wrote a history report about columbus.  columbusthat's italian for "boy, am i lost." i wrote a report about king tut and i wrote a good king tut joke to open my report with but binky told my king tut joke in his columbus report.  everybody laughed, but you know what the real punch line was.  he toldmyjoke thatiwrote, and i got a "d".  i don't get it.  i think it's a pun.  well, it wasn't very "punny." punny...   and the winner is george.    i can't believe i didn't win.  win. you didn't tell a single joke.  that was the comedy of truth.  all the greats do it.  aw, i should have just told jokes.  this is all binky's fault.  i don't think buster's ever going to stop holding this grudge against binky.  arthur: our first day of college, buster.  isn't it exciting.  is binky here.  he told my joke.  it was a good joke.   announcer: ladies and gentlemen, the president of the united states.  binky told my joke.  it was in mr. ratburn's thirdgrade class and he...   oh, dear.  arthur: if i make this shot it's the best game of my life.  he told my joke.  it was a good king tut joke.   oh.   buster.  you can't stay mad at binky forever.  it doesn't do any good.  if i keep it up, i'll make sure binky gets a "d" and is totally miserable.  that's what's happening to you.  don't you see how holding a grudge is only hurting you.  you've been mad since binky told the joke.  i know what you're saying.  you're saying the only way i could be happy is if binky never told that joke in the first place.  yeah, and it's too late for that.  so to stop him i must travel back through time and change the past.  what..  i need a time machine or a rocket that can travel faster than light speed around the sun.  you can't change the past, buster.  oh, i can't, can't i.  you can't change the past, buster.  oh, rats.  i understand, buster.  i was mad when i didn't get a green icecream cake for my fourth birthday.  yeah.  and i'm going to stay mad until i get it.  that's silly.  staying mad won't get you what you want.  but you think that way.  after all the work i did on that report binky ruined it.  buster, you hardly did any work at all.  your whole report was about eggnog.  that's not my fault.  they put it right next to egypt in the encyclopedia.  i guess itwasmy fault.  i deserve a "d." binky. hey.  whoa.  i just wanted to tell you i'm not mad anymore.  you were mad.  yeah, about you stealing my joke.  what joke.  what does king tut say when he gets scared.  "i want my mummy."  that's funny.  i think i've heard it before, though.  you heard it when you stole it from me and told the class.  when somebody tells you a joke you're supposed to tell it to someone else, right.  but i made it up for my report and then you used it without asking.  that's like stealing.  well, i didn't mean to steal it.  here's um... 70... 73 cents and sticker of a cool car and a button.  that's all i have... sorry.  what did he say.  he gave me 73 cents a sticker of a cool car and a button for my joke.  i got paid for writing a joke.  i'm a professional.  yahoo.  with your being naturally funny and me making up good jokes i bet we could really go places.  like my own tv show.  sure, you and me and arthur.  us maybe, but i don't think arthur.  who would want to watch him on tv.  visit us online at pbskids.org hi, everyone, it's me, buster.  if you love the great food we get to eat in elwood city, you won't believe all the great food i'm trying on my trip with my dad.  mmm... don't you just want to eat some.  i'm tasting everything and i'm sending it all back to my friends in elwood city on my very own video postcards.  they'repostcards from buster.  visit us online at pbskidsgo.org.  you can findarthurbooks and lots of other books, too, at your local library.  . what a wonderful kind of day .  . if we could learn to work and play .  . and get along with each other .  . you got to listen to your heart .  . listen to the beat .  . listen to the rhythm, the rhythm of the street .  . it's a simple message and it comes from the heart .  . believe in yourself .  . for that's the place to start .  . and i say hey. .  . hey. what a wonderful kind of day .  . if we could learn to work and play .  . and get alongwith each other .  . hey. what a wonderfulkind of day. .  . hey. .  funding forarthurwith captioningis provided by...  chuck e. cheese's, proud supporter of pbs kids, helping kids discover the fun of learning not only what theworldcan do, but also whattheycan do.  pbs kids, where a kid can be a kid.  and by a grant from the united statesdepartment of education through the corporationfor public broadcasting and by contributionsto your pbs station from: every week...  that's me.  martha speaks is proof positive...  do we love llamas, people.  ...there's nothing like a talking dog.  hello.   )
