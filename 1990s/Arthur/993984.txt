other   hey.   what a wonderful kind of day   hey.   what a wonderful kind of day   hey.  hey, d.w..  hey.  whoa...   my sister d.w. is perfect.  she never does anything wrong.   d.w.: it wasn't me.  what happened to the chocolate clairs.  pal ate them.   what.  what's so funny.  if george washington were like d.w., history would have been a lot different.  i cannot tell a lie.  the tree chopped itself down.  bad tree, bad.  d.w. never gets blamed for anything.  well, except for this one time...   d.w.: arthur did it.   how many more guests.  well, i think we can cover that.  bye.  d.w.: dad.  what is it, honey.  bud and me are bored.  i'm a little busy, d.w.  why don't you guys go and play a game.  okay.   three, four, five.  hey, i win.  let's try again.  seven, eight, nine.  well, how about that.  i win again.  let's play tower of cows.  aw.  i thought you had it.  you were so close.  weasel rally.  the winner.   rock, paper, scissors... shoot.  rock, i win.  rock.  i win.  paper, me again.  how about that.  must be my lucky day.  feel like i could fall into a barrel of skunks and come up smelling like roses.  i think we should play throw the hat.  how's that go.  like this.  i win.  that's a new one on me.  is it my turn now.  i guess.  i'll try to throw it farther.  here goes.  wooee, look at that.  you did it wrong.  here, watch.   swamptown froggies, sing this song    croak, croak    croak... croak...    look what you made me do.  it's broken.  it doesn't sing right.  its singer is busted.  i'm awful sorry.  we better tell your pa.  d.w., you're in trouble.  no.  we shouldn't tell.  i don't want to get you in trouble.  maybe he won't notice it's gone.  wait here.  i'll be right back.  what are you doing, d.w..  getting rid of the evidence.  if dad doesn't see it, he'll never know it got broke.  .  i didn't do it.  i was going to ask where bud is.  bud.  bud who.   drat.  hello.  dad : oh, hi.  yes.  uhhuh...    shhh.  ow.   ick.    what happened in here.  i cleaned up.  oh.  i've been thinking that maybe we should tell your pa what happened.  bud, you need to go home now.  oh, all right.  only, well... you see, there's just one thing.  my hat.  i think my ma would skin me alive if i came home with it lost.  maybe we could ask your pa to reach it down.  froggy. where's froggy.  d.w.: he's too busy.  i'll get it.   missed.  it's okay.  bud: ouch.  it's okay, i'm okay.  whew.  we need more shoes.   i got it.  incoming.  your pa is not going to be a fan of me.  that's it.  d.w.: it's not strong enough.  let's move it closer.  come on, come on.  what happened.  uh...  maybe we should get a ladder, and...  that's it.  i meant we should ask your pa to help.  he's too busy.  come on, grab that end and be quiet.  how soon.  well, sure, that's possible.   what is it.  is it your diaper.  no, no, no.  not you, mrs. fallon.  we need something to hold the door open.  how about this.  it was a gift from my greatgrandfather to my greatgrandmother.  it's been in the family for over 100 years.  yeah, that old thing's perfect.  .   huh.  ..  what on earth.  i don't see how we'll ever get it up.  dad: what is going on here..  uh, just a game of throw the hat, sir.  i thought you two were going to play a quiet game.  i guess i better get home before i cause more trouble.  i'll get my hat later on.  now, young lady, suppose you tell me...   oh no... i'm late.   what on earth happened here..  gah.   mom.  what's up, d.w..  why don't you stay down here.  there's nothing to see upstairs.  what did you do.  what on earth.....  d.w., do you have something you want to tell me.  mmm...  not really.   i can't believe one kid could cause so much destruction.  it wasn't on purpose.  there's something missing.  missing.  nothing's missing.  what could be missing.  hang on.  is this bud's hat.  uh, uh, yes.  i mean, bud didn't mean to do anything bad.  dad: honey.  i'm taking off.  i'll get kate.  i'm definitely calling his mother about this.  poor bud.  he's in trouble now.  he must feel scareder than a balloon at a porcupine party.  you're my friend, nadine.  you're supposed to be on my side.  and quit talking like him.  it's a crying shame.  i can't understand how that nice little boy could be so destructive.   what was that.  i didn't hear a frog.  or anything like that.  it came from down here.   quiet.  what.   bud's mother.  perfect.  hi, cisley, i'm glad you called.  i want to speak to you about bud.   .  hang on, cisley.  what's the matter, honey.  it just happened.  i didn't mean for him to be a balloon at a porcupine party.  honey, slow down.  tell me what's the matter.  what happened.  it was me.  i did it.  i killed daddy's frog.  bud: it surely is a piece of luck your pa didn't mind about that old frog.  yeah, but they're still making me stay home all week and i'm not allowed to have anyone come over.  well, at least you told the truth.  i think that's awful brave of you.  i'm sorry i said it was your fault.  that's no nevermind.  and hey, we can still play this way, right.  ready.  rock, paper, scissors... shoot.  d.w.: what did you get.  bud: rock.  d.w.: i got paper.  i win again.  bud: man, oh, man.  this is surely your lucky day.  and now...  hi, my name is jeraliz and this is my secondgrade class.  today we're learning about chain reactions.  the domino effect.  oh, i did it again.  a chain reaction is when one thing causes another thing to happen.  it makes something else happen.  and then another thing happen.  we're going to start this chain reaction with air.  oh, that was so close.  that was an accident.  d.w. accidentally broke a frog.  and one thing led to another.  she made a chain reaction.  girl: just like d.w., we're making our own chain reaction.  we're making a blueprint.  first we made designs.  make the two marbles fall into the bucket.  this one will move the ball and this will move.  and that's the crazy invention.  and then we tested our idea.  sometimes things didn't go the way we planned.  that was cool.  it wasn't working.  so we had to change our design.  ready, guys.  yes. yes.  totally.  oh...  oops.  oh, no.  it went backwards instead of forward.  but we didn't give up.  until we made a chain reaction.  i'm too excited already.   yay.   it worked.  here we go.   and now...  hockey stick.  behind the door.  d.w. has come up with some pretty looney schemes in her life.  like when she tried to raise money for a new doll by selling tissues.  tissues here.  do your nose a favor.  only five cents.  ahchoo.  this one's halfprice.   arthur: or the time she tried to get mom and dad to take her to france by pretending to be french.  ooh, zee meatloaf.  eet eez so tender.  eet reminds me of paree and my brozer, fairy jacker.  and then there was the time she...  excuse me, i have to borrow your bedsheet.  what for.  sorry, sir, i can't tell you.  it might compromise the mission.  but since she's met bud, her schemes have gotten twice as looney.  okay, captain bud, the sailboat's all ready.  now what.  wait for rain, then sail to jamaica.  ladonna: i heard it's as high as a skyscraper and it goes so fast your cheeks get floppy and you can't chew gum for a week.  arthur: the buzzard is not that high.  it's just a new ride for kids.  yeah, kids... in astronaut school.  arthur: ladonna.  well i've trained to go on the hurlawhirl, so i'm prepared.  i don't know what a hurlywhirl is but some silly ride isn't going to scare me.  don't say you weren't warned.  here's 12 tickets for each of you.  what'll it be first.  both: the buzzard.  now bud, no backing out.  me.  never.  my middle name is tucker, but it should have been danger.  here, put out your hand.  eww.  i hereby declare a most solemn pact that we shall go on the buzzard no matter what.  witness, please.  duly noted.  you're weird, bud compson.   dad: kids.  the entrance is over here.   hi, ed.  how's the party going.  the cocktail weenies don't taste right because you have to heat them in the oven.  i'm guessing your oven is in the kitchen.  hold on.  i'm just going to sit on that bench and take this call.  i'll meet you as soon as the ride is over.  where's bailey.  a croquet injury.  no backing out, right.  couldn't even if we wanted to.  a pact's a pact.   d.w.: the line hasn't moved in minutes.  maybe hours.  what's going on.  are people cutting in.  no cutting.  i'm calling the ride police.  i don't believe it.  we're next.  i thought this moment would never come.  not so fast.  step under bongo.   sorry, bongo says you're too short.  no, i'm not.  my hair's just flat today.  this monkey clown is a liar.  bongo doesn't lie, gumdrop.  now grow an inch or scram.  next.  it's so unfair.  why couldn't i be born with a big head like arthur's.  i don't trust that bongo.  i bet he raised his hand.  emily: d.w., bud.  want to go on bumpy boots with us.  bumpy boots.  please.  i haven't liked that since i was three years and 11 months old.  that ride looks like it's for babies.  principal haney: hohoho.  delightful.  we're going on the buzzard.  they said we couldn't, but that's not stopping us.  it isn't.   i wouldn't go on that thing if you paid me.  well, have fun, i guess.  but you heard the ticket guy.  we're too short.  so.  we just have to make ourselves taller.  dad: now, you're going to want to turn the temperature up.  that's the dial with all the numbers on it...  daddy, we're hungry.  we need money for food, lots of food.  hold on a second, ed.  here, go get yourselves something.  but stay where i can see you, okay.  two more with nothing on them, please.  and how much for your scrunchies.  you really think this will work.  are you kidding.  it's foolproof.  hey, will you look at that.  we grew.  must have been all that milk we drank.  ah, yes, the old waffleshoes.  listen, hushpuppies, bongo and i have seen every trick in the book, so you and your breakfastslippers can beat it, see.   now, open the oven door and tell me how the weenies look.  i'm glad they look "comfortable," but what color are they.  bud: pull harder.  i'm pulling as hard as i can.  well, am i taller yet.  how should i know.  i don't know how to measure.  we should just use these for the bumper cars.  you can't give up now.  we're so close.  we're not close.  we're a million lightyears away.  okay, so maybe my plans haven't worked out perfectly.  they haven't worked at all.  but we made a pact.  and a pact is a solemn vow that must not be broken.  isn't that right, rapty.  yup, it says right here in the big book of kids' laws that a pact sealed with the slimy hand must never be broken.  thank you.  fine, if you're bringing your imaginary friend into this, i'm calling mine.  but it says in subsection 81b that if the pact is impossible to fulfill, then the parties are free.  true, but both parties must agree to end the pact.  pinocchio has a fascinating commentary on this.  nadine: i read pinocchio's commentary, but...  whoa... whoa...  hey, watch where you're spinning.  sorry.  i was just on the buzzard and there's this part at the end like a corkscrew, and then...  wait.  you got to go on the buzzard.  how'd you get past that monkey.  um, i don't know.  i guess i was just tall enough.  mom: james.  got to go.  but james is three weeks younger than me.  there is no justice in this world.  kind of makes you want to beat the system, doesn't it.  okay.  but this time, we're using my plan.  d.w.: we've been going about this all wrong.  instead of trying to make ourselves taller, we should make bongo shorter.  first we distract the ticket guy.  i'll tell him jokes that are so hilarious, he'll be crying too hard to see what's going on.  meanwhile, you knock down that wooden clown and break his feet off.  then all we have to do is stand him back up, step under him and voila.  we'll be tall enough.  it's show time.  you again..  where's tweedledum.  never heard of him.  hey, why do polar bears wear fur coats.  you try wearing a hawaiian shirt at the north pole.  yukyukyuk.  this is for giving me the stinkeye.  go down, monkey, go down.  and then the seal says, "thanks, but i already atean iceburger." oh, come on, that was funny.  about as funny as a hat full of fire ants.  listen, snowshoe...  break time.  it's no use.  bongo won't budge.  he's some kind of super clownmonkey.  and we spent all our tickets except for these two.  huh.  you're mine now.    where... where's the exit.  someone take my barf bags.    a pact is a pact, right.  maybe just this once, we could break the...  yes.  i hereby declare this pact broken.    help. we want to get off.  and you put a bowl of mustard on the side.  congratulations, ed.  you've just made cocktail weenies.  bye.   i'm so glad i'm not on that thing.  me too.  and it was nice of them to give us our tickets back.  what do you want to go on.  it may not be that exciting, but it sure is relaxing.  hang on.  we're heading for that clog.   it never gets dull.  whicharthurcharacter are you.  i'm a dw because sometimes i get a little bit annoying.  everyone knows that everything revolves
