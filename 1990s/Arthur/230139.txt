  and get along with each other.   hey.   what a wonderful kind of day    hey. what a wonderful kind of day.   hey.  arthur: hey, d.w.  hey.  whoa.   mom: come on, d.w.  time for school.  oh, boy, school.  all finished.  let's go or we'll be late.  take your cereal with you.  d.w., we've got plenty of time.  d.w. really loves school.  sometimes i think it's her favorite thing in the whole world.  whee.  all:  a moomoo here, and a moomoo there    here a moo, there a moo, everywhere a moomoo.   another pumpkin muffin, d.w..  thank you, ms. morgan.  arthur: but i remember one time when d.w. didn't think school was so great.  how was school, honey.  um...  okay.  i'm not going back.  i'll never go to school againi can't.  d.w.  hey.   listen up, boys and girls.  soon our class will have our first fire drill.  wow, our class will have a fire drill.  children: ooh. wow.  ms. morgan, what's a fire drill.  it's a plan to get us out of school safely in case there's a fire.  huh... fire.  we're going to have a fire.  yeah, that's why we'll have a fire drill.  first let's practice lining up quickly and quietly so you'll hear my instructions.  everybody up.  don't take anything with you.  this is so great.  fire drill, yeah, fire drill.  stop...  drop...  and roll.  good.  stop...  drop...  and roll.  this is fun.  what's it for.  for when your clothes catch fire.  wait a minute, when am i going to be on fire.  fire drill, fire drill...  stop...  drop...  and roll.  very good.  ms. morgan i'd like to get some stuff cleared up.  we're going to talk about fire safety all week.  all you questions will be answered.   .  huh.  i said, do you want lemonade.  oh, yeah, sure.  hey.  .  arthur, be careful.  she keeps moving so i'll spill it.  i didn't do anything.    smoke detector.  i think it's d.w.'s room.  there's no smoke.  do you smell it.  now it's coming from downstairs.  wha...  .  what are you doing..  i'm testing the smoke detectors.  the ones in my room and the kitchen work.  mom: that's not a game.  now, back to bed.  what's happening.  mom : go back to sleep.  sorry, i was just trying to be helpful.  i know.  go to sleep now.   both: fire drill.  fire drill.  fire drill.    whew.  mommy, i don't feel good.  i don't want to go to school.  she's faking it.  she was up all night with the alarms.  she can stay home.  what about me.  i was up, too.  guess i can't go to school.  don't you have a math test.  yeah, but...  oh, all right.  good luck on your test.  i think school's outhere come the tibbles.  hey, tommy. timmy.  anything important happen in school today.  we colored.  and what else.  didn't you do anything important.  we glued some sticks.  the fire drill..  was it today..  both: nope.  you didn't miss the fire drill.  mom, i can't go to school today either.  i'm still sick.  look at my elbow, it's all wrinkly.  d.w., you love school.  what's wrong.  why do you not want to go.  i do want to go i just don't want to go when there's a fire drill.  it's stupid.  fire drills are really important.  do you want me to come in.  no, that's okay.  i'm almost 4 1/2.  i can take care of myself.  that's my big girl.  have a good afternoon.  there she goesthe best mother i ever had.  i may never see her again.  she'd have come in.  i don't want to put her through this crazy fire drill stuff.  morgan: a wet towel over your head helps protect you.  and remember, it's important to stay close to the floor away from the smoke.  has anyone seen d.w..  is she still sick today.  she's probably playing hockey.  you mean hooky, tommy.  there she is.  do what you want to the school but i will not be a part of this insanity.  pass me my juice and cookies.  mom: and i think she's really afraid.  ms. morgan said it was tough getting her back inside.  you know, there might be something we can do to help.  i've got an idea.  keep them closed.  okay, you can open them.  d.w.: ooh, a red hat.  is it for me.  i hereby appoint you our official fire warden.  i'm a warden now.  back in your cell.  it's not that type of warden, d.w.  no talking, remain calm. faster, people, there's a fire in here.  what's it say.  three minutes, nine seconds.  not bad but we've got to get it down to 58 seconds.   d.w.: come on, nadine.  you can do it.  just a little more.   whew, what a day.    mom. dad.  the bathroom's on fire.  arthur: that's steam.  i'm taking a shower.  oh, that reminds me: bring out your wet towel, i need it.  paper is flammable.  you should use something else.  you can't always wear a wet towel, d.w.  okay.  i was a little scared of my first fire drill, too.  but it was okay.  do you feel better.  no.  they didn't set the school on fire so you shouldn't be afraid.  but that was in the olden days.  things have changed.   i know it will be today, i just know it.  it'll be fine, d.w.  just like the fire drills we did at home.  yeah, i know.  boy, i sure wish i could tell time.  hey, what's that clock say.  is it time to go.  i don't know.  you want to help me build a castle.  okay.  hey, maybe it's not going to happen.  what's not going happen.    fire drill, you know what to do.  everyone line up.  both: fire drill. fire drill.  fire drill. fire drill.  come on, guys.  get in front of me.  we're not supposed to take anything with us.   i don't see any fire.  my crayons will melt.  i have to go to the bathroom.  girl: ms. morgan, wait.  my shoelace is undone.  is it hot in here or is it me.  maybe both.  smoke. i smell smoke.  i can't breathe.  there's no smoke.  just relax, tommy, we're almost out.  whew.  good work, class.  you've just completed your first fire drill.  you mean that's it. it's over.  that was a fire drill.  it wasn't bad.  speak for yourself.   deep breaths, tommy, deep breaths.   will we have any more fire drills.  not for a while, d.w.  how about a tidal wave drill.  i've seen big waves on bear lake.  or volcano drills.  we have to be ready for anything, you know.  how did it go, d.w..  arthur: are you okay.  of course i am.  it was just a fire drill.  can i have a cookie.  and now a word from me, firefighter scott.  all: let's go to the fire station.  my name's firefighter scott.  i put my pants and hood on.  then i put my coat on.  this is my "scott tank." this helps me breathe inside the fire.  then i put my mask on.  this is the sound that it makes.  if you hear this, i'm a friend.  then i put my helmet on.  we want you to go to him and not run away from him.  what's that other light for.  so i'll be able to find you in the smoke.  you shine it to see us.  you have to know what my hand feels like so you can find my hand.  you know you have fire drills.  well, we're going to do a fire drill here.   attention engine one, squad five and ladder two.     kids: and now back to arthur.  my sister d.w. can drive me crazy but someone drives her crazy, toothe tibble twins.  they always want to be better than d.w. at everything.  d.w., we can yell loud than you.  i don't care.   yadda, yadda...   yadda, yadda...  arthur: they could ride a twowheeler first.    and they could tell time before d.w...  they said.  so what time is it.  it's eleventytwelve.  he's right.  someday i'm going to be able to do something you can't.  both: no, you're not.  yes, i am.  no, you're not.      what on earth was that.  : we caught a tiger.  we caught a tiger.  oh, dear.  oh, rats.  that's not even a tiger.  i'm so sorry, sir.  did you boys ask permission to dig this hole.  it's not a hole.  it's a burmaese tiger trap.  and he broke it.  can i keep the peanutbutter cup.   d.w., the tibble twins are coming over while mrs. tibble buys sod.  don't worryyou lock up the china i'll get a ball and keep them in the yard.   i'll be trapped inside with the tibble twins for a whole hour.  i can run faster than you, d.w..  i can get dizzier than you, d.w..  i have an idea.  let's sit quietly and color.  quietly.   : this was my favorite coloring book.   help me with the tibbles.  i have 207,000 math problems for homework.  when you babysat them, they were quiet.  yeah, i told them a story.   we can bounce higher than you.  sit down and i'll tell you a story.  you can'tthe only real stories are in books and you can't read.  i can too read.  you cannot read.  because we can't.  and if we can't, you sure can't.  i can read before you.  i've been reading for a long time.  since when.  since last thursday.  i already readed these books.  no way, no way, no way, no way.  if you can read, what's that say.  it says...  it says "television." is that right.  i don't know, i can't read.  sounds right.  okay, read this book.  it's got pictures so we'll know if you're reading it right.  um, that's boring.  i'll find a good one.  this one's great.  that's all words.  i'll read them all to you... sit.  these are the adventures of a smart, great, perfect girl named... b.w.  hey, that's close.  if it was d.w., i'd think you were making this up.  : quiet, i'm reading.  b.w. was a great kid who was a princess, a genius and a cool person but she was too polite to brag.  and she had her own pony who... lived in her room.  and her parents said that was okay.  it was a perfect life, except for one thinga big old nasty thing.  and that thing was...  her big brother.   he wasn't just a big brotherlike that's not bad enoughhe was a big brother megatransforbalizer.  and like that wasn't bad enough he had an awful partnerbusttrantor.  rock singers:  busttrantor, busttrantor    busttrantor...    busttrantor, the hungry robot    he just wants to eat    busttrantor, the hungry robot    likes veggies more than meat.     their most recent rotten crimethey stole the world's most valuable snowball.  they won't get away with this.    b.w. to walter, have you located the bad guys' hideout.  locked on, b.w.  sending you in three, two, onetransport.  i'll take 'em by surprise.  oh, no, you're not.   : that balance beam, my only chance.  nobody's that good at balancing.  busttrantor: she won't escape.  she can't even ride a twowheeler.  oh, no.  not only can she ride a twowheeler she can ride a nowheeler.  they chased but couldn't catch her.  they chased her over the lake which everybody said had no octopuses in it but really there were 7,000 octopuses in it.  she was brave and didn't panic so the great b.w. escaped but the bad guys weren't so clever.    that night b.w. went to a restaurant with her parents.  only b.w. was smart enough not to eat the spinach that had turned everyone else into spinach heads.   mom, dad, don't eat the...  both: dah... dah...  oh.  the only thing that cures spinach heads is the power ring of power.  b.w. knew that the ring was being used at her aunt lucy's wedding.   ow.    the power ring fell into the organ.  b.w. reached for it grabbing it just before it fell to the center of the earth.    but b.w. couldn't use the ring for without the magic blankie, the ring was powerless.  my magic blankie is missing.  dah.  b.w. called for her secret agent, nadine an agent so secret, no one else had ever seen her.  secret agent nadine located the blankie.  but finding it was hard in the superconfusing allinone mart.  we're lost.  : we're not lost.  theywerelost, possibly forever.  b.w.: wait.  look.  i knew i'd find it someday.  the snowball can show us the way out.  look.  b.w.: inside crazy bus.  my blankie.  b.w., wait.  why.  i have my snowball, my blankie and crazy bus will take us home.  what could be wrong...   b.w. had been tricked by her rotten brother.  no one could save her now.   i knew she'd fall for the old, phony glowingsnowball trick.  ah.  b.w.'s faithful eagle, spanky flew to the rescue like a streak of bird.   the brave and bold bird defeated the villain.  but... he sacrificed himself to save her.  : his heart was too big.   b.w.'s good friend the president had a big funeral for the brave bird.  : spanky was the bravest, boldest, best bird.    spanky was so brave.   : he was the best bird.  tommy, timmy, your grandmother's here.  aw. aw.  rats. rats.  d.w., what did you do to them.  she read to us from the best book ever.  um... i'll go open the door.  she read to you. d.w..  from one ofyour books.  can we borrow it.  she didn't finish.  yeah, sure.  bye, d.w..  wait. the book.  arthur said we could borrow it.
