 hey.  whoa.     pal.  shh. come here, boy.   hang on tight.   open the gates.  they're escaping.  where's friar buster with our escape vehicle.  jump in.  buster, there were no cars in robin hood's time.  oh, yeah, right.  um... it's a wagon.  they got away.  after them.  we're a perfect team, friar buster.  verily.  i'll get you yet.     buster: i can't stand it.  this is horrible.  arthur: cut it out.  i'm trying to read.  i'll turn the page.  just a minute.  the suspense.  he's about to get...  buster. would you...  oh, man. i can't believe it.  okay, i'm turning the page.  "the end." whoa.  robin hoodwas the best.  i was in such a hurry to finish but now i'm sorry it's over.  i wish there were more books.  i bet that after this story ended they had even better adventures.  buster: yeah, i can imagine all of their great adventures.  i can think of a hundred.  let's write an adventure book...  that doesn't end.  yeah.  brigands attacking from every directionthere's no escape.  brigands: yo. ho. yo. ho. yo. ho.   you writing this.  "climbing ropes..." any on hang gliders.  yeah.  there's four on hang gliders and two riding a dinosaur.    arthur: slow down.  how do you spell "apatosaurus".  buster: our heroes escaped the deadly tree house but there was more danger outside.  after them.      shh.   huh.  shh.  it takes a huge bite out of the roof...  oh... sorry.  this is great so far.  we'll write more after school tomorrow.  i wrote a whole new chapter last night.  i think you better tell some jokes.  francine and brain look sad.  buster. hello..  what's wrong.  i'm going to stay with my dad.  oh... read the pages.  arthur, don't you even care.  about what.  he often spends weekends with his dad.  this time i'm going to stay.  what.   we can't take this lying down.  a couple of months is...  practically forever.  i don't want to go, but i kind of do.  since my parents divorced i've never spent much time with my dad.  i've got a plan.  we'll do exactly what the heroes in our book would do.  we'll dig a pit under my house and you'll live in it.  they'll never find you.  i'll live in a pit.  yeah, and i'll sneak you leftovers from the table.  dig. dig.  seeing my dad is more fun than living in a pit.  : but you don't want to go, do you.  i guess i sort of do want to go.   oh, i've got to gosee you.   if you won't eat now, we'll save you something.  i'll eat his dessert.  .  can i just go to my room.  sureif you want, i'll come up later to talk.  nowcan i eat his dessert.  i thought he was my best friend...  but he wants to go.  i bet he doesn't want to go.  he could've stayed and lived in a pit, but he said "no." try thinking how buster will feel.  you're losing one friend but everything else stays the same for you.  buster's losingallhis friends and going to a new place.  it can be scary.  i know. we moved a lot because of my father's job.  it's hard.  buster probably needs a best friend now more than ever.   ow.  hiwhat are you doing.  saying goodbye to my bike.  want to come while i say goodbye.  yeah.   goodbye, elwood city.  sue ellen says going somewhere new is tough.  so... it's okay if you're scared.  thanks.  buster: i bet i'll never find another tree house that can fly to outer space, go back in time and become invisible like that one.  it'll still be here when you get back.  yeah.  goodbye.  goodbye, arthur.  goodbye, buster.   arthur: oh, no.  what is it.  what's wrong.  we forgot to talk about how we'd finish writing our book.  aw, man.  i can't believe he's gone.  arthur, want to go to the sugar bowl.  yeah. i'll call buster and see if he wants to go...  oh, i forgot.  : use the force, arthur.  what are you talking about.  oh, i don't know.  i just thought it was funny.  i wrote a letter to buster.  i need the address.  i can give it, but he's not at home now.  what.  since his dad's a pilot buster's doing some traveling with him.  so he'll never get my letter.  he will eventually.  i know how you feel.  i miss him, too, but he'll be back.  he's not gone forever.  he's gone forever, i know it.   mom: this package came in the mail for you.  from buster.  he can read all right, but he can't write "read." this is a plane just like his dad fliescool.  and they saw this building and he wrote the next chapter of our book and the places he's going so i can send letters: paris, new york, walla walla.  walla walla.  where's walla walla.  what's walla walla.      surrender.  fools. you can't escape us.    tour guide: this is how chocolate is made.    we have to save the tourists.  and the chocolate.  this is the best chapter yet.  it happens in all the places he went.  i feel like i was there myself.  buster: it's the next chapter from arthur and the places to check out for our story.  that sounds fun.  where are the sewers.  mom: you'll be surprisedbefore you know it, buster will be back.  arthur: i miss him but i don't mind if he's gone for a long time.  you don't.  no, he's having a lot of fun and besides, i just got an idea for our second adventure book.  there's a lot more places he has to go to.  kids: and now...  we're writing stories.  each kid writes one line.  girl: to make it complete.  boy: they are pretty funny so far.  one day, when jan was little, she got a pig.  she hated that pig...  boy: because he tracked mud...  and she gave the pig to her friend, bob.  bob took it to the fair.  bob and the pig won first prize.  all: the end.  on my first day of school...  boy: a kid was teasing me.  it didn't go well.  then it got worsei sat on a tack.  i dreamed about going home.  the pencils came alive.  boy: they attacked us.  all: the end.  one day there was a old man walking down the street.  boy: then he saw a scorpion in a purple bathing suit.  they laughed at the scorpion because he looked funny.  then the scorpion fainted.  boy: when he woke up it was all a dream...  but he was still wearing the purple bathing suit.  he was happy.  all: the end.  once upon a time there was a man named flaba.  he was silly.  he had an old house.  he ate blue muffins every morning.  then aliens stole his magic book.   i'll tell you the end.  flaba got his magic book and put magic on the aliens and the aliens flew away.  all: the end.  kids: and now...  arthur: i want more icing on the cakes and more cream in the custard.  hello, i'm arthur read and i just had my 18th birthday.  i'm now an adult.  i'm the
