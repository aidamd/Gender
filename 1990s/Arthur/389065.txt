 to start    and i say hey.   hey.   what a wonderful kind of day    if we could learn to work and play    and get along with each other.   hey.   what a wonderful kind of day    hey. what a wonderful kind of day.   hey.  arthur: hey, d.w.  hey.  whoa.   dad: arthur, hurry up.  we only have a few hours before the museum closes.  can i come, too.  coming.  can i.  arthur: no.  this is for me and dad.  you're spending the day with mom, d.w.  but i want to go to the museum, too.   could you take d.w. today.  kate's sick and i've got to get this account finished by tonight.  unicorns. can we.  no.  d.w.: daddy, this is scary.  can't we see the uni....  arthur: no.  can't we see the....  arthur: no.  guide: sir, this might not be the exhibit for your daughter.  i said no.   arthur, she's right.  why don't i take d.w. to see the unicorn dolls and meet you back here in an hour.  i used to wonder what little sisters were for, and i've finally figured it out.  they're there just to wreck things for us guys and our dads.  whoa.   hey.  d.w.: then there was this pretty ballerina unicorn.  she did pillowettes.  i didn't like the super unicorn man.  and then there was a japanese unicorn in a kimono and thenoh, yeah.a russian dancing one.  and lookdoesn't this clown unicorn look just like arthur.  can i be excused.  arthur: i want to do my homework.    arthur, are you okay.  listen, i'm sorry.  i know you were hoping it would be just the two of us today.  yeah.  which is why i was thinking next weekend we could go fly fishing at whale lake.  why. are there unns there.  dad: no, just you and me.  and it's such a great place, arthur.  my dad used to take me there.  the fish practically leap into your lap.  d.w.: dad, it's time for my bedtime story.  in a minute, d.w.  really. just you and me.  no d.w..  that's rightno d.w.  it's okay if you don't catch anything on your first day.  proper casting takes years of experience and...   d.w. : daddy, it's d.w.  can you come home right now.  because i'm just a little girl.  oh, poor d.w..  wow.  d.w. : daddy, are you still listening to me.  let me help you.  it's okay, dad, i got it.  arthur.   oh, no, arthur.  i'll save you.   d.w. : daddy, you hung up on me.  daddy, it's me, d.w..  d.w. who.  d.w.: i still don't get why i can't come.  because it's my weekend with arthur.  next weekend will be your weekend.  mom: david, you've got a call.  okay, thanks.  well, next weekend is going to be so much more fun than this weekend.  dad and i are going to, um...  unicorn lake, and i won't have to fish for unicorns because they'll want to play with me.  you won't be able to come with us, no matter how much you beg.  i won't be begging.  because this is my weekend.  ..  uh, kids. bad news.  i have to work next weekend.  what..   oh, that's okay with me, dad.  d.w.: no, it's not okay.  what aboutmyweekend.  i'm supposed to get next weekend.  it's not fair if arthur gets another weekend and i don't.  it's not fair.  d.w. : i'm going to go fishing.  i'm going to go fishing.  no, d.w., you're going to stay at camp and go swimming with mom and kate while arthur and i go fishing.  hey, can we play my...  no. no mary moo cow.  arthur: that's all i ask.  please, dad.  sure. what'll we listen to.  man : "henry skreever, book six: "'henry skreever and the cauliflower queen.' chapter seven..."  dad: we have a problem.  mary moo cow :  the best word i know is fun    fun spells "fun"...   dad: okay, arthur, get ready.  the road to this camp is very hard to find, so keep your eyes peeled for a tree with a white arrow.  arthur: is that it.  dad: i don't think so.  it's got a...  wait, dad. is that it.  dad: thanks, d.w.  huh, guess things have changed.  you just have to keep your eyes peeled.    you're right, dad.  nature's great.  don't worry, arthur.  the secret fishing spot is up that hill away from all this.  it'll be great.    dad: it's an hour's hike, but wait till you see it.  d.w.: wait. wait.  i'm coming, too.  dad.  i told you, d.w., the fishing is just for arthur and me.  i'll be back tonight and we'll toast marshmallows, all right.    look at that, arthur.  what did i tell you.  yeah, dad, it's great.  okay, let's go.  now, the idea is to get the fly out there without letting it splash.  then pull it back so it just skims the water.  otherwise, the fish know it's not really a fly.  and do it again, like this.  hey, dad, why is this called whale lake.  is it shaped like a whale.  no, iroquois legend has it that a whale once swam up the scraw river and still lives in this lake.  i always used to look for it, but...  well, it's just a legend, really.  okay, ready to go.  like this.  that's right.  now, don't take it too far back.  not too far back.  not too far back.  not too far...  well, that's okay.  it's tough to get the hang of it.  just reel it in and try again.  one more time.    sorry, dad.  that's okay.  we have plenty of flies left.  good.  perfect.  now cast.   arthur: haha.  i did it, i did it.  great cast.  uh, just hang on to the pole next time.  no, dad, it's my fault.  i'll get it.  careful. those rocks are slip...  whoa.  d.w.: "safety first." that's what mary moo cow always says.  .  i'm just trying to help.  you can't catch fish if you aren't safe.  it's just a minor sprain.  we have all day tomorrow to try again.  yeah, d.w., there's always tomorrow.  arthur: ow.  dad: i think maybe we should let you rest that ankle today.  no, i know i can...   : okay.  does that mean i can go.  no.  i... mean...  maybe it'll help you rest if i take her away for a while.  yay.  you know, mom.  thiswasa good idea.  it's nice just to be by the lake in peace and quiet.  d.w. : mom.  i got fish. i got fish.  you meandadgot fish.  no, d.w. caught them.  what..  dad says i'm a natural.  look.  dad: it was strange.  the fish seemed to love that mary moo cow song.  but... but...  d.w.: it's fish fry time.  arthur: but last time we went camping, you freaked out when we caught just one fish.  that was before i discovered my gift.  oh, d.w., these will be delicious.  dad: don't worry, arthur.  if your ankle feels better tomorrow, i was thinking you and i could fish before going home.  really.  um, my ankle feels better.  i think we're just going to have to call it quits this time.  we could wear ponchos.  please.  d.w. i have a bad feeling about this.  kids :  mary moo cow, mary moo cow...   did you catch anything.   what's that smell.  you guys just missed the fish.  yes, you should have seen it.  they were practically leaping out of the water.  mary does it again.  man: hey, buddy.  thanks.  your little girl's a fish magnet.  campers:  mary moo cow, mary moo cow    i love you, yes, i do...   i can't take it anymore.  ow.  it's not fair.  arthur.  she always gets what she wants and now she even fishes better than me.  she was pretty lucky this time, but what you did was even rarer.  what was that.  not many boys would be kind enough to let their little sister come on their own private fishing trip.  in my book, that beats catching fish any day.  d.w. : come on, it's time to go.  okay, arthur, what do you say we start...  no, dad, wait.  daddy, it's...  dad, look.   dad: the whalewe saw the whale.  arthur spotted the whale.  what whale. where..  it's gone already.  but... but we saw it.  i've waited my whole life to see it and arthur spotted it.  d.w.: wait, dad.  can't we go back.  i want to see it, too.  please.  wow.  kids:..  we're going on a whale watch.  hello.  boy: a whale watch is when people from the aquarium take you out on a boat...  ...and look for whales.  girl: and it's really cool because you see whales in their natural habitat that they live in.  a whale is like a giant fish.  it's a mammal, really.  it's a mammal.  but it lives in the ocean.  boy: a whale is a mammal that breathes air and gives their babies milk, like we do.  they have blowholes for them to breathe.  a whale's tail would go like this, but a fish's would go like this.  i hope we see a lot of whales.  woman : now, whales are mammals like you and i.  on the ship there's a ladya naturalist named dale.  she tells us about the whales.  dale: you want look around for visible blower spout, some splashing.  it's over there.   dale: right next to the boat.  close to us right now.  beautiful look.  girl: it was a finback whale.  it was the baby, the calf.  dale: finback whales are the second largest animal on earth.  boy: it came 15 feet up to the boatthat doesn't always happen.  dale: we don't normally see finback calves.  this is just so really special for us to see this.  girl: it's really important that we see them, because they're endangered and not many of them are left.   kids:and now...       d.w., is that you.      but how can i wear my red and purple dress with only one red and purple sock.  i'm sorry, honey, but i cat find your other sock.  are you sure you put it in the hamper.  i bet arthur stole it.  why on earth would arthur want your socks.  i don't know.  maybe he wanted to use them as earwarmers for his dog.   hey, get away from kate.  you'll give her germs.  d.w., relax.  they're just playing.  she ruined my concentration.  i was so close to making a hole for you to escape.  that's all right, we'll try again later.  d.w. seems very upset about that sock on her foot.  i'll say.  don't people usually put two of those on your feet.  why does she only have one.  i don't know.  but then how else could it have disappeared.  i need that sock.  it's my special sock.  and my foot's cold.  kate: she's really upset.  this sock thing is worse than i thought.   well, i better go find it or she could be like this for days.  no, just lint.   good lint.   get a hold of yourself, boy.  you have a job to do.   hello.  what's this.  and this.    see.  a hair.  and it doesn't belong to any of us, i can tell you that much.  : you think.  yes, an intruder.  i smelled the sock here.  he must have dropped it while escaping.  and he likes fish.  it's a scale.  i find them sometimes in my seafood supreme.  excellent work, pal.  now, who do we know who is cunning, devious, and likes fish.  both: nemo.   easy, pal.  slow down.  hi, francine.  pal pulled me here.  what ya doing.  well, well, if it isn't arthur's runt.  i wish i could say, "look what the cat dragged in," but i didn't have the pleasure of dragging you.  hand it over, sugarpuss.  hand what over.     give me back that sock you stole.  but i didn't steal any sock.  then how do you explain this.    ew. what is it.  it's your hair.  i found it in our laundry room.  that's not my hair.  it's brown.  my fur is black and white.  are you colorblind.  as a matter of fact, i am.  i was never in your house, dog.  ask that silly toad who hangs around your yard if you don't believe me.   but if it wasn't you, then who did steal the sock.  beats me.  but remember that ham bone you buried in the flower patch last spring.  it was delicious.    easy, pal.  slow down.  since i left d.w., things have been good.  i have my own pad nearby.  do you get lonely living on your own.  it would be nice to meet some other amphibians, but i hate the pond sce.  have you seen any strange animals going into the laundry room.  now that you mention it, something did go in there just yesterday.  well, my ham bone is definitely gone.  i dug up the daisies, the rosesnothing.  pal, toady saw something.  was it a cat.  i'm not sure what it was, but it was much larger than a cat.  and it was breathing heavily, like this:  what if it's a raccoon.  or a tibble.  whatever it is, it has to be stopped.  and i think i know just how to do it.  kate : pal, do you read me.  are you in position.  i'm coming, i'm coming.  what's a stakeout without donuts.  all right, pal.  now, we wait.   kate : pal.  he's here.  suspect is approaching the sock.  aha.  caught you red...  : no.  it can't be.  and to think his name means "friend".  it's not what it looks like.  i mean, s, i am stealing your socks, but it's for a good cause.  you mean, there's a charity for humans without socks.  even so, amigo...  amigo: no, it's more important than that, but it is difficult to explain.  come, i must show you.  kate : be careful, pal.  if you're not back by sunrise, i'll call the parents.  every pet knows that humans cannot survive without us.  well, a long time ago, some pets decided to form a secret group called "the fur masons".  the fur masons were dedicated to finding new ways of helping people.  they trained dogs to lead people who are blind and cats to catch mice.  they even sent some of their members to space.  but their greatest gift to the humans was this...   the sock exchange.    i've got an argyle here.  who needs an argyle.  this is amazing.  but how does all this help people.  it's very complicated.  ah.  here's someone who can explain it to you.  good evening, mr. greenspaniel.  my friend here wants to know what the purpose of the sock market is.  : our challenge is to ensure that we extend the favorable macroeconomic performance and bolster the capabilities of all to share in the prosperity that is being generated.  i didn't understand a word he said.  actually, no one does.  all i know is, we take their socks, they buy more.  it's good for the economy.  so that's why there are so many missing socks.  from the hairy shin of his...  but amigo, the one you took was very important to d.w.  i'm going to have to ask for it back.  sorry, pal, i don't have it.  it's out there somewhere.  the only way to get it back is to try to trade it for another sock.  you mean, i should...  : play the sock market.  it's easy.  just remember: always buy low and sell high. )
