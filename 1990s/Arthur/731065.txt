 greetings, master.  why have you come.  i wish to learn the way of the big brother.  the path is long and will cost you dearly.  okay, forget it.  uh... wait.  all right, i'll throw in the first lesson for free.  come on in.  we begin with a demonstration: "eagle retaining remote." take the remote from my hand.  you really are the master.  now, retrieve the cookie.  how did you do that.  it's called "big brother becomes the wind." the time has come to test your skills on a worthy opponent.  .  here is your challenge.  get to the remote before d.w.   hold on. i'm not ready.  that's better.  now, i don't know what arthur told you, but i'm the one who makes the rules here.  huh.  the rules say that i get to make the first move.  i also get to make the last move.  rule #1:..  what do i do now.  use "finger block" and "run like water." it is the best defense against "little sister squawks like chicken."  i can run and talk at the same time, you know. wait.   well, dear, shall you tell him.  can i. or do you want to.  what. tell me what.  both: we're planning on adopting a baby.  what do you think.  okay.  may i be excused.  wide world of wrestling is on in two minutes.  the timber twins have splintered the competition, but look who's waiting in the wings.  you better knock wood, timber twigs.  so now that your show's over, let's talk a little.  how are you feeling about all this.  great.  can't wait to see the timber twins take on horace the hacksaw next week.  so how do you feel about our plan.  um, fine, i guess.  will it be like having a pen pal.  will i have to write him all the time.  well, no.  adoption means you're going to be somebody's older brother forever.  you mean, when we adopt, i'll get to be a big brother.  that's right.  some kids become brothers and sisters by birth and some by adoption.  i'm going to be an older brother.  yep.  we're going to adopt from china, so it'll probably be a girl.  i'm going to be an older brother with a little sister.  whoohoo.  so when are they going to send us my sister.  isn't she going to be scared flying all the way here by herself.  no, because we're going to go to china to get her.  we're going to china, too.  this is the best day ever.   announcer: and in this corner we have bernie the bulldozer, wide world champion five times over.  tonight he'll take on binky and his sisterthe pair of despair.   i can't see. i can't see.   uncle. uncle.   well, big brother, you better get ready.  i'm all packed and ready for china.  binky, it could be a whole year before we go.  a whole year. why.  because there's lots to do.  there are forms to fill out, interviews we have to have, paperwork we have to send to china, meet with a social worker.  well, what am i supposed to do until then, just wait.  you can help us with some of the paperwork.  here, i hereby elect you keeper of the checklist.  your job is to help us keep on track and get everything done.   okay.  well, there isn't a box for it, but that toast needs buttering.  look, this picture's for the people in china taking care of my sister, so make it good.  don't forget to smile.  but show them we're serious about this.  um, serious, but also really nice.  that's it.   you sure everything's in here.  it's all ready to go.  i triplechecked the list.  binky: good luck.  have a safe trip.  our papers are on their way to china.  ah, my favorite: peanutfree egg rolls.  xiexie.  sue ellen taught me how to say "thank you" in chinese.  it's so wonderful that you've been learning some chinese words before our trip.  little sister is"meimei." and big brother is"da ge." here's to getting all our paperwork in on time.  now there's nothing to do but wait.  i hope it won't be long.  oh, we still have more to do.  for one thing, we've got to get your sister's new room together.  are we going to build her a new room.  hey, maybe i could get a bigger room while we're at it.  no, no, we're going to turn the spare room into your sister's room.  the spare room.  you mean, my game room.  some of the stuff in there we can give away or store in the garage.  what stuff.. not my stuff.  don't worry.  we'll find another place to put your games.  oh, my, i forgot i put this up here.  you know, this would look nice in your sister'sbai jia bei. what's that.  it's a "one hundred good wishes" quilt.  we'll ask friends and family to contribute a piece of fabric and a good wish for the baby.  then i'll make a quilt for your sister out of it.  did you make one of those for me.  well, no.  it's a tradition from northern china.  i didn't know about it when you were a baby.  so she gets a hundred good wishes, and what do i get.  binky.  for your sister's quilt.  she's going to love unicorns.   for your sister's quilt.  so she'll believe.   hmm...  i know checkers is in here somewhere.  hey,here's my patch.  the one with the pandas.  oh...  i can't find anything anymore.  look what just arrived.  can you guess who this is.  binky: my sister.  she looks kind of... small.  can i call my mom and d.w..  of course, dear.  let's invite them over to see the picture.  i thought we were going to play checkers.   i'm an expert at taking care of babies.  so call me anytime.  thank you, d.w.  i'll keep that in mind.  when can you bring her home.  well, the call could come any day now.  oh...  i forgot about binky's travel shots.  shots.  was that it. was that the last one.  yep. that was the last one.  oh, this baby better be worth it.  oh, no.  can i put this in your bag, mom.  oh, dear, we can't take that.  but the red lacewing is only found in china.  this could be my chance to see one up close.  binky, we've got to put some of these diapers and baby formula in your bag.  i don't need that stuff.  they're for your sister.  oh.  hmm...  that's better.  now we're all packed.  fine.  i'm going to bed.  father: thanks for helping, son.  guess there's no room for me and my stuff anymore.    mother: breakfast time, you ittle, wittle, sweetie pie.  and you too, binky.   mom.  mom.  here we go, babywaby.    stop. i'm not baby food.  help.  binky, wake up, dear.  but it's 3:00 in the morning.  come on.  we've got a plane to catch.  don't do that, honey.  no kicking, sweetie.  you want me to come back there and make you stop.  binky.  i'm so sorry.  but she was kicking me.  why are you taking her side.  i bet that's how it's going to be with my sister, too.  what do you mean.  it's just that you don't care about me like you used to.  oh, binky, i know this is a big change for all of us, but i'm going to love you as much as i always have.  this thing keeps blowing cold air in my face.  this might help.  you made this for me.  i thought you'd like to have abai jia bei, just like your sister.  thanks, mom.  this is great.  so, are you looking forward to meeting her.  yeah, i am.  i wonder if she's looking forward to meeting me.  buster:  you're in them, you shoot them, you make them    it's "postcards from you."   this "postcard from you" comes from laura and emma in arlington, massachusetts.  hey, come on in.  this is my friend emma. hi.  our parents adopted us in china.  they went from here all the way to china.  and this is me.  i look way different now.  this is my mom, my dad and me.  this is my mom and dad on the great wall of china.  i'm hungry. me, too.  okay, girls. let's go. why not.  i like dumplings.  this is a dumpling.  are those eyes.  those are eyes.  bye. bye.  here's a "postcard from you" from our friends at unicef.  this one comes from filmon and david in sweden.               to see more"postcards from you," visit:     woman : soon we'll begin our descent into beijing.  mom, we're almost there.  oh, my, i feel as if i've been on this airplane forever.  dad, wake up. huh. what.  are they serving breakfast.  oor is it dinner.  no, we're landing.  i can't wait to meet mei lin.  will she be at the airport.  no, dear.  it'll be at least two or three days before we can pick her up.  more waiting.  father: don't worry.  there'll be lots of sightseeing to distract us.       now, run along, little fella.   hey, this opera calledthe monkey king has some of the best acrobats in the world.  it's tomorrow. can we go.  i'm not sure, binky.  we're picking up your sister tomorrow, remember.  isn't she pretty.  such a cute baby.  what if they can't find us.  or what if they give us the wrong baby.  : now, that won't happen.  this agency has done this lots of times.  they know what they're doing.  besides, we know what she looks like.  binky: oh, yeah.  that's her.   : ...mei lin.  mr. and mrs. barnes, here is mei lin.   binky: why is she crying.  did we do something wrong.  no. she just doesn't know us yet.  it'll take a little time.   binky: come on, dad, please.  when will i ever get a chance to see a real chinese opera again.  i don't know.  mei lin's had a busy couple of days.  i think it'll be okay.  oh, look, she's falling asleep.             maybe we should go.  but it isn't over yet.  shh.  look at the monkey king, mei lin.  look. see. monkey.  like this.    she's not hungry.  i've changed her diaper.  maybe her ears hurt.  here, let me try for a while.   i'm sorry, but could you please do something about your baby.  hey, mei lin, look at me.   thank goodness.  nice going, kiddo.  it's all in the cheeks.   and then, all i do is this.  and she stops crying just like that.  but it only works whenido it.  wow. you have a special gift.  like tyler the cat psychic on that showordinary people with extraordinary powers.  arthur: buster, there's no such thing as a cat psychic.  oh, yeah.  then how did tyler know that mr. jiggles would only eat minced mackerel.  you really think i have a special gift.  it sounds like it.  hey, maybe we could get it on tape and then you could be on the show.   announcer: ladies and gentlemen, binky, the human pacifier.          announcer: binky, the human pacifier.  okay, come over tomorrow.  i'll show you how it's done.  buer: how can you tell when she's about to cry.  with kate, it can happen really fast.  one minute she's fine, and then suddenly, she's upset.  we'll have to wait it out.  your turn.   stand by, binky.  and... action, mei lin.   another false alarm.  what does it take to get a baby to cry around here.  she'll cry when she's good and ready.   i win. want to play again.  i don't know.  maybe we should go.  buster: we can't give up now.  i saw a behindthescenes special about that movie, penguins do the darnedest things, and it took them years to get them to do those belly flops off the iceberg.   buster: wow, that's loud.  okay, binky, show us your gift.  mei lin.   she doesn't like the camera.  move back.  mei lin.     do you want this.   what did you do that for.  i was just trying to help.  i didn't need help.  i was just warming up.    mei lin.   hi, mei lin.  come on, dad. let's go this way.   look, mei lin.  i'm a dancing moose.     hi, mei lin.  what areyoulooking at.  binky: banana split, heavy on the chocolate syrup.  brain: tough day, binky.  binky: it's my sister.  i used to be able to stop her from crying with a single look.  but now the magic's gone.  maybe you need to try something new.  i've tried everythingsilly hats, funny dances, animal sounds.  what about a simple lullaby.  you think that'd work.  sure. lullabies are a proven method of soothing babies.  and recent studies suggest that early exposure to music stimulates brain development.  i'll take this to go.  good night, sweetheart.   binky: wait.  i know just what to do.  :  rockabye, baby    .  on the treetops    when the wind blows     the cradle will rock.    uh, binky, thanks for your help, but it's time for you to go to bed, dear.    buster: whoever can stop the princess from crying shall be given the title of true brother.       next.     binky: it's not fair.  he's had practice being an older brother...twice.  how can i compete with that.   we have to go back to china.  what. why.  because mei lin's not happy here.  she wants to go back to her real home.  binky, her real home is right here.  when we adopted her, we became her family forever.  but if we go back to china, mmaybe i could get my special power back.  oor... or maybe i could get a new one.  hey, i have an idea.  why don't we all go out for chinese food tonight.  would you like that, binky.  i guess it'll have to do.  oh, look, it's the reads.  we should ask them to join us.  mom, no.  what if mei lin wakes up and starts crying.   i think the reads understand about crying babies.    binky: oh, no. she's awake.  don't cry. please. i can't take it.  when arthur's around, it's like i'm invisible.  you'd probably rather havehim for a brother.  hey. what'd you do that for.      hey, mei lin, do it again.     itaught her how to do that.  isn't it amazing what brothers and sisters learn from each other.  i learn a lot from arthur because he makes so many mistakes.  if i want to do something right, i just do the opposite of what he does.  .  what. i'm giving you a complimentation.    they're talking baby talk.  i wonder what they're saying to each other.  what are those things on your brother's face.  they're called glasses.  fascinating.  my brother's the one with the noodles on his chin.  he's so sweet, but sometimes i wish he'd realize that it's not all about him.  you know what i mean.  kate: oh, i sure do.  arthur loves to play peekaboo.  at first it was fun, but he insists on doing it over and over.  kate. mei lin. kate. mei lin.  peekaboo. peekaboo.  peekaboo. peekaboo.  here we go again.  clap and laugh. clap and laugh.   hi, everyone, it's me, buster.  it seems like everyone in elwood city is always on the move, and in my travels with my dad, i'm finding a lot more people who are really going places.  i'm jumping into the action, too, and sending it all to my pals in elwood city on my very own video postcards.  they'repostcards from buster.  visit us
