milk.   don't ever answer any questions wrong or he'll send you to death row.  death row.  ratburn: have you done your math exercises.  i did the first 5,000, sir.  then you have 9,995,000 left.  get

heads.  i can wait for girls' heads but i must have boys' heads immediately.  wait, he'll see usand we have boys' heads.  there's no time.  i need them now.  i'll get them myself.    what are you doing.   ratburnhe's looking for body parts: heads, boys' heads.  a vampire doesn't need heads.  arthur: this is no ordinary vampire.  he's beyond vampire.  what's beyond a vampire.  a ratburn.   hey, what....  stand still.  he wants boy heads, not girls'.  breakfast.  what do you think he'll do with that saw.  i read a book where kids discovered a scary mystery like this and became detectives to solve it.  we should probably investigate.  we have a lot of homework to do.  you're just a fraidycat.  arthur, we have to choose: face horrifying, scary danger or do our homework.  both: horrifying, scary danger.    francine: i'm bored.  he's not doing anything weird.  you probably heard him talking about heads of lettuce.  boy heads of lettuce.  maybe grocers call the rotten ones that.  i'm

puppet shows.  jack, you're disorganized.  you'd forget your head if it wasn't attached.  uhuh, would not.  grab your head and hide.  here comes the giant.   arthur, look.  giant: fee, fi, fo, fum.  kids: ew, yuck.  ratburn: they always crack.  i must use 50 boy heads a year.  boy heads. boy heads.  i never have enough boy heads.  you make puppets.  can't talk, boys.  i have 40 seconds to get jack ready.  must stay on schedule because of all i do.  you do a lot.  you're a teacher, a coach you work on the school paper.  i can't even find time to do my homework.  learn to organize your time.  some people think i give a lot of homework.  both: not us.  learn good work habits and you'll discover...  jack, where are you.  : just a second.  you're capable of more than you think.  i'll teach you how to do that homework and have more free time.  like how you do all that stuff plus puppets.  exactlytwo seconds early.  selfdiscipline is as important to learn as two plus two.  : my head's on straight.  man, your head's on straight but your body is backwards.  please don't stand there.  i have to concentrate on my work.  oh, sorry.  boy, were we wrong.  boys, i can't wait to see your geography projects tomorrow.   kids: and now...  my teacher's name is mrs. erlandson.  mrs. erlandson.  kids told me she was mean.  i wasn't scared of her.  division in the second grade.  we can do
