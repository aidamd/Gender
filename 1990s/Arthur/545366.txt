 . believe in yourself .  . for that's the place to start .  . and i say hey. .  hey.  . what a wonderful kind of day .  . if we could learn to work and play .  . and get along with each other. .  hey.  . what a wonderful kind of day .  . hey. what a wonderful kind of day. .  hey.  arthur: hey, d.w.  hey.  whoa.       you're driving everyone crazy with all this banging around.  i'm just trying to get rid of my loose tooth.  it'll fall out when it's ready.  now it's bedtime.  and no more horsing around.  i mean it.  just a minute.  i'll be right out.  you look so weird.  okay, maybe, but if you were the only kid in the third grade who still had all his baby teeth, you'd be desperate, too.    huh..  : mom. dad.  you guys awake.  : mom. dad.  are you up yet.  we are now.  what's the matter.  i have an announcement to make.  i, arthur read, have my very first loose tooth.  that's nice, dear.  that means it'll fall out soon.  now please, let's all go back to sleep.   : i finally have a loose tooth.  really.  that's great, arthur.  aah...    my tooth just fell out.   children, how many of you have lost a baby tooth.  all : me.  i have.  me.  that looks like everyone...  everyone except arthur.  baby.   well, we're going to watch a video about our teeth.  film narrator:all is quiet in toothtown until...  just the place to build a little home.  just need to get rid of these pesky teeth.  oh, no. the plaque monster is attacking toothtown.  looks like a job for the flighty fluoride scour rangers.  . go, go, scour rangers. .   it's scouring time.  hiyah.   we can't beat the plaque monster like this.  we need toothbrush power.   how dare you, scour rangers.  now try some floss on for size.    all: hooray.  between ages four and seven most children begin to lose their baby teeth.  except arthur.   look at the cool tricks i can do with the space in my teeth.   kids: ohh...   kids: ooh... ahh...   kids: whoa. ooh... wow.  hey, guys, check this out.   hey, i can do that.   me, too.  let's see who can squirt the farthest.  go on, arthur, it's your turn.     francine: does anyone have a bib for the baby.  would you like milk and cookies.  no, thanks, i'm not really hun...  wait.  did you say cookies.  yes.  the crunchy kind.  they are.  good.  can i make a request for dinner.  i don't see why not.  here you goextra well done steak just like you requested.   still there.  try some corn on the cob.  time for dessertpeanut brittle and... rock candy.   d.w.: hey, arthuri know how you can get rid of that tooth.  how.  turn into a shark.   their teeth always fall out and they grow new ones.  i learned that at the aquarium and... i got this.  hmm...  well, if it isn't arthur the baby.  yeah. here comes the baby. .  not so fast.  it just so happens i lost a tooth last night.  way to go.  oh, yeah.  i want proof.  it's a tooth, all right.  seems awful big, though.  let me see that.   ohh...  he must have really liked that tooth to make a necklace out of it.   buster: are you nuts.  forget it.  arthur: please.  i need somebody to punch me there.  no way.  buster, this tooth is driving me bonkers.  if you were a real pal you'd punch me in the mouth.  well... okay.  yow.  binky, i need you to do me a big favor.  yeah. what is it.  punch me in the mouth.  you want me to punch you.  it'll be a pleasure.  now, hold still...  this is going to hurt.  oh.  i can't do it.  brain: tadah.  my new toothremoving machine.  i invented it especially for you.  first...  a demonstration.  put your head here.  then i press here...    and...voila.    hey, come back here.  : selfdestruct. selfdestruct.   uh... no machine is perfect.  mom. dad.  i think my tooth's getting looserlook.  you need professional help.  you're going to the dentist today.  ah, going to the dentist.  very good.  boy, do i feel sorry for you.  yeah, me, too.  if they don't fall out they yank them out.    aah.  i bet it'll be fine, arthur.  arthur read, dr. sozio will see you now.  are you all right.  yeah.  let's do it.  so what seems to be the problem, arthur.  i think something's wrong, because i'm eight years old and i still have all my baby teeth.  ah, i see.  one's real loose, though.  are you going to yank it out.  let's take a look.  i don't think that will be necessary.  sure is a stubborn little baby tooth, huh.  having baby teeth doesn't make you a baby, arthur.  i didn't lose my first one until i was nearly nine.  everyone is different.  really..  yours will fall out very soon.  just wait.  well, if it isn't arthur the baby.  did he yank it out.  did you bleed.  nosome children don't lose their teeth until they're nine.  everybody is different.  i'm the tooth fairy.  whoever i throw the ball to loses a tooth.  but arthur can't play.  he's way too young.  the tooth fairy doesn't come to babies.  okay, but if you ask me now you're being the baby.  arthur's right, francine.  i'd rather play softball anyway.  you can't leave me.  i'm the tooth fairy.  ..  arthur: ouch.   are you okay.  i'm really sorry.  it's okay, francine.  it's just what i needed.  what are you giving me this for.  you're the tooth fairy, aren't you.  that will be 25 cents, please.  huh.  kids: and now...  child 1: when you grow up, you get bigger stuff than when you're little.  you get bigger teeth than wheyou're little.  the bigger we get, we need bigger teeth.  because our mouth gets big, we need bigger teeth for our mouth.  i lost my tooth and i was so excited that i swallowed it.  i pulled it out all by myself.  it feels weird.  it hurt a little.  it feels like there's a hole in your mouth.  if you want it to come out real bad, you just pull it out.  "once there was a girl, margaret.  "she was surprised when the dentist said "she had a loose tooth.  "one night maggie's parents came into her bedroom "and said if she didn't pull the tooth out "the dentist would.  maggie pulled the tooth out." the end.  the tooth fairy takes them from under your pillow and puts them on houses.  child 1: everybody imagines what she does with them.  i think she grinds them up to make magic.  i made a place where everything gets made out of teeth.  the tooth fairy makes statues of people and then they take the teeth and put them in the mouth of the statue.  kids: and now...  hello, you might know me as d.w.'s imaginary friend nadine.  i'm here because it would be unkind to present this story without a friendly warning.  we are about to unfold the story of a girl who wished to be grownup.  like the time she said she was grownup enough to help her father.  let me help, daddy.  i can help.  i'm big enough to help.  okay, but take one at a time.   we're just supposed to take one.  that's because he thinks i'm a baby.  whoa.  huh.  whoa.  where's the cake.   oops.  this is a story to thrill you, shock you, maybe even...  d.w.: hey, nadinelook at me.  be careful, d.w.  don't do anything to hurt your mommy's suit.  i won't.  don't be a worrywa... oh.   if you do not care to subject your nerves to such a strain well, we warned you.    wait, come back.  d.w.: boy, look at how it sparkles.  they're made of actual stones.  stones. wow.  what's that mean.  you're kidding, right.  of course i am.    d.w.: arthur.  oh, it's only you.  arthur, what's a stone.  a stone is a rock.  a rock like you dig up in the yard.  mom.  yes, honey.  arthur ate a piece of cake.  what's a stone.  why didn't you have an apple.   i was too weak from hunger to chew it.  i needed something soft.  what kind of stone, d.w..  a stone like in beautiful earrings that every girl should have.  no.  d.w.: i didn't ask anything.  how could you say no when i didn't ask anything.  well, whycan't i have earrings.  you're not old enough and they'll turn your ears green.  i don't care if i have green ears.  they just aren't you, d.w.   d.w.: earrings.  i like your earrings.  do you like my earrings.  what do you think.  my earrings.  how did you get those on your ears.  i didn't make holes in my ears.  i glued them to my hair.   ow. that hurts.  you're pulling my hair.  sorry.  what have we always told you about glue, .  glue is for paper, not for skin, and never put it in your soup.  ow.  i just wanted you to see how beautiful i'd lookow.  i told you not to use glue.  d.w., i'll make you a deal.  if we go shopping for earrings...  you'll know i've got to have them.  and if i think you should wait.  then i'll waitpromise.  announcer : welcome to all in one mart the store big enough to swallow your town.  i thought that was you.  uh, what a surprise.  yes, imagine a highclass man like myself shopping here.  but you can't be too rich or too cheap.  d.w.: mom.  there it is.  mom.  as my accountant, can you spare your best customer five minutes.  or should i take my business elsewhere.  just five minutes, d.w., sorry.  we need to make changes in my taxes.  if i wanted to give away that much...  if we want to seem grownup we have to wait patiently.  but he always talks for an hour.  i could go there and be back before she even knows i'm gone.  but...   announcer: all in one mart values all our customers but break it and you've bought it.  it never seems to get any closer.  hey, that looks like arthur.   we should go back to your mom.  yeah, okay.  announcer: specials on preworn sneakers for lazy people.  are we lost.  no, of course not.  this way.  i could talk all day but like einstein said, time is money.  this way.  we passed this three times.  no, i would have remembered that.  it looks like arth... thur.  uhoh.  i'll be able to see mom from up there.  announcer: if you've lost your child come to our lost child department.  and why not buy a new toy for that poor, frightened child that you lost.  attention

on sale in our wind department.  watch the screens.  mom is out there somewhere.   look at all those clumsy people.  there they are.  there's your mom.  you don't belong in here.  uhoh.  if you'd been figuring out where your mom was instead of looking at those dumb earrings...  i know, i know.  what if we never find her.  why couldn't it have been that clunky arthur who got lost instead of my darling d.w..  what if she doesn't even miss me.  dad: whatever happened to d.w..  you remember: i lost her 20 years ago.  that's when it got so nice and quiet around here.   i'm starving.  me, too.   food. food.    free desserts at aisle 12.  free dessertslet's go. where's aisle 12.  sorry, no samples left.  what if we never find our way out of here.  it wouldn't be so bad.  they have everything here you need to live on.  duh.  it's the phantom of the store.  nadine, we've got everything we ever wanted.  but i miss my mommy and daddy and kate and pal and even arthur.  we're alone and hungry and freezing.  maybe we should move away from the frozen food.  announcer: who doesn't like warm, carbonated milk.  it lulls you to sleep and burps you, too.  emily, hi.  hi, d.w.  you here to buy more earrings.  no, i'm returning mine.   we have to go.  announcer: chocolatecovered cabbage.  it's the dessert that makes you go "blech." you should ask her where your mommy is.  i'm not a baby, nadine.  maybe sometimes grownups ask for help, too.  emily, wait.  did you see my mom anywhere.  she's talking to mr. crosswire by the entrance.  thanks, uh... where's that.  go back to the end and turn that way.  there she is.  that was easy.  i told you i would find her.  you worry too much.  well, my five minutes are up.  thanks for waiting so quietly for five whole minutes.  that was only five minutes.  ready to look at earrings.  i thought it overi don't really need earrings.  i'm impressed.  that's a very grownup attitude.  thankscan we do lunch instead.  announcer: right now in our free sample department everything is halfprice.  kids: and now...  brown: the idea for pal came when we wanted to get a pet at our house, and i invented a pet that arthur could have.  i start with this oval shape, and then i give him eyes and a little triangle for his nose.  and pal's a pretty happy dog, so we'll make him smiling.  and we'll add his ears.  now we'll give him his collar, and he's off for an adventure.   visit us online at pbskidsgo.org.  you can findarthurbooks and lots of other books, too, at your local library.  onal f foundation] . what a wonderful kind of day .  . if
