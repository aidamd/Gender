it's a simple message, and it comes from the heart    believe in yourself  believe in yourself   for that's the place to start  place to start  and i say, hey hey.  hey. what a wonderful kind of day  if we can learn to work and play    and get along with each other  hey. what a wonderful kind of day  hey. what a wonderful kind ofday  hey.  arthur :.  hey.  whoa.   have you ever thought about how much it takes to make something amazing like this...  from this tiny seed.  how much time and care you have to...  buster.  buster: oh, yeah. sorry.  planting and watering and...  buster.  i thought you said you wanted to direct this scene.  buster: i do.  then keep the camera on me.  buster: okay, okay, just let me finish this one game.   where was i.  oh, yeahhow much time and care you have to give to it.  planting and watering and...  buster: i won. i won.  woohoo.  buster.  you just knocked the camera over.  i knew i shouldn't have let you do this.  sorry.  it's just i've never won this game before.   buster: ice cream.  sorry about that.  our director seems to be a little distracted today.  let's just start the show.   buster: reporting for duty, sir.  what happened.  at ease, baxter.  and hand me that towel.  buster: you said you wanted to see me "on the double".  that's right, son.  it's an emergency.  and you're the only one i know who's up to the task.  yes, sir.  i mean... i am.  fritz wants me to take care of the community garden.  i thought you were taking care of it.  muffy: yeah, ever since fritz went into the retirement home.  i was just helping to take care of it.  fritz was still in charge.  so, why can't he continue to do it.  he broke his ankle, and there's no one else who likes to garden, so now i'll be in charge.  what.  you.  in charge.  of the whole garden.  why not.  i've learned lots about gardening since i started helping out.  i'll just have a little more responsibili...  ty.  oh, yeah.  responsibility.     ice cream.  mmm.    okay, weeds...  here i come.  oh.   help.   i'm sorry.  it was just one ice pop.  it was six ice pops.  okay, okay, six.  but i ate them really fast.  fritz would've never let this happen.  yeah, he was responsible.     fritz, you can't put me in charge of the garden.  i'll just mess it all up.  no, too frantic.  fritz, it's a great honor, and i'm really grateful, but...  hi, mr. sloan.  morning, buster.  but i'm just not responsible enough.  you should get someone who...   ahh.   what are you doing.  getting rid of these awful plants.  awful plants.  but those are zucchini.  it was okay when fritz was taking care of this place, but now it'll just become an eyesore.  some folks in the neighborhood and i thought it would look better if we just paved it over with concrete.  you want to turn the garden into that.  i suppose we could paint it green if you like.  how did you get him to stop.  i called fritz and he convinced mr. sloan to give me a chance.  so now you're really in charge.  uhhuh.  the garden can stay as long as i keep it in good shape.  wow.  i know.  it'll be a lot of work, but i have to at least try.  so you'll come to baseball practice when you're done, right.  okay.  when's he coming.  he knows there's not enough of us for a game without him.  he said he was coming after he finished in the garden.  muffy: just like buster.  so irresponsible.  francine: i give him a week.  muffy: two days.  ahh.   phew.   i'll be back in a bit.  i've got some weeding to do.   francine: i give him a month.  yeah, a month, tops.  if he makes it all the way to summer, i'll eat my pink taffeta party dress.   aha.  dead leaf.  oh, honey, that garden is looking so terrific now.  i'm so proud of you.  thanks, mom.  so, tonight, could you just pull out the clothes you want to take on vacation.  okay.  what. vacation.  we're going camping, remember.  oh, yeah. right.  what's wrong.  you love camping.  yeah, but... what about the garden.  well, someone can certainly water it for two weeks, don't you think.  you want us to water it.  every single day.  muffy: we don't even live there.  i know, but i have no one else to turn to.  please.  i promise i'll return the favor.  like by showing up for a game once in a while.  yeah, and being responsible to your friends.  come on, guys, give him a break.  of course we'll do it.  francine: okay, if you promise to come to the next game after you get back.  yeah, just don't let us down.  aw. thanks, guys.  well, i'll be.  it was only two weeks.  i did water it.  so did i.  i never renege on a promise.  then why are all the plants dead.  okay, so, maybe i didn't water it every single day.  yeah, i had a conflict last week so i asked muffy and she said she'd water it for me tuesday.  yeah, so i asked arthur to do it and he said okay.  ayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayay.  no, you called and asked me to do it on wednesday, remember.  muffy: i thought you went to animal world with your cousins on wednesday.  francine: well, yeah, but i thought if we missed one day of watering it wouldn't be that big a deal.   did any of you water it, ever.  bitzi: buster, have you done your homework yet.  well, you know the rules about video games.  homework first.  what's the point.  the point.  i'm irresponsible.  no, you're not.  look what you did for that garden.  yeah. and look at it now.  that wasn't your fault.  yes, it was.  fritz put me in charge of the garden and my friends didn't water it, so i'm the one who's irresponsible.  i always have been and i always will be.  whoo, i won.   that must be mr. sloan mowing it all down now.  argh.  i can't take it anymore.  stop. don't touch those plants.  buster: please. give me another chance.  i promise, i'll...  mr. read.  francine: hey, buster.  wha...  you guys.  what are you doing.  we're just taking out the dead stuff so we can start replanting.  we realized if you could change and become responsible for something, then we should, too.  fritz: private baxter: just writing anote to find out how the garden's doing.  i've been out of town with my family this month, but figured you were responsible enough to keep that garden in shape without me.  was i right.  yep, you were right, fritz.  you were right.   thanks.  and now...  our school has a community garden where we grow herbs, fruits, vegetables and flowers.  student: back in april, we first planted the peas.  let's talk about how to plant.  student: ms. caitlin is our garden coordinator from city sprouts.  ms. caitlin: i'll give each of you two seeds in your palm.  student: city sprouts is an organization that helps schools plant gardens.  i am digging a hole for my seeds to go in, and then you have to cover the hole up.  student: this garden here, we have it because we're in the middle of an urban city, and most children that go to the school, they can't have gardens, so they would come here to learn about where the food is from.  student: we're going to measure how much it grew over time.  student: we're doing this for math, and we're measuring them by centimeters.  student: between april and june, our plants kept growing and growing.  ms. caitlin: we're going to walk down to the garden and check on our peas.  we'll go down and see how big they are.  student: today, now it's the end of june.  we're going to start with the one down here, and then we're going to put your finger there.  so you have 30 and 30 is how much. sixty.  plus 17.  seventyseven.  okay.  student: my pea plant is 77 centimeters.  oh, yeah. i found two big pea pods.  student: my plant is 80 centimeters tall.  i think it's doing okay.  i thought that this will grow to 43 centimeters, but it grew to about 110 centimeters.  student: we harvested.  and "harvested" is when you pick the plants out.   it's crunchy, and it's really sweet like candy.   it's better than the peas from the grocery store.  student: i really don't like peas.  but when i tried these peas, i loved them.  this is so good.  it's the best i ever had in my life.  and now...  brain: one berryopolis with coconut snow.  mmm, thanks.  buster, are you sad.  me. no.  why do you look so shocked.  i'm not shocked.  why would you think that.  you know, it's okay to be sad, buster.  i'm not sad.  hey, binky, how's it...  did you get a haircut.  no.  muffy: well, there's something different about you.  you look strangely mature.  mmm...   have you ever noticed how something different in the way someone looks can change how you think about them.  binky, you're going to have to clean that up.  someone could slip on it.  i'm cleaning, i'm cleaning.  just don't stomp on me.  stomp on you.  i wouldn't hurt a fly.  how about five dollars.  would that cheer you up.  i told you, i'm not sad.  sometimes people are just so hung up on appearances.  just tell me what it is, buster.  muffy is listening.  hey.    okay, pal, i'm getting up.   huh.  that's weird.  where did my glasses go.  since when do you eat dad's puffy oatey fiber flakes with extra fiber.  ugh.  that explains why they taste like sawdust.  you look different.  did your head get smaller.  i can't find my glasses.   d.w.: arthur lost his glasses.  i didn't lose them.  i just can't find them.  i'm sure they'll turn up.  uh...  we'll organize a search party after breakfast.   nope. wrong glasses.  man: 5.6, 7.2, 52 and 113.  is this really necessary.  if the child talks, my measurements will be off.  i need absolute silence.  just let helmut take his measurements, dear.  fascinating.  your head is the same size as an immature honeydew melon.  these are the correct glasses for your face.  arthur: the lenses are so small.  i can barely see a thing.  perhaps.  but you look fabulous.  i wish they just had my old glasses.  sometimes it's good to try something new.  i think those look very, uh...  is this the right price.  they're made of helmutite, an alloy of my own creation.  they can withstand the weight of a pygmy hippo.  what about those.  well. do you like them.  um... i think so.  they're subtle, unassuming, yet they reveal great inner strength.  artaud, those glasses are you.  my name's arthur.  i'll throw in this musical case.    you look like a toaster.  dad: i think he looks very intellectual.  what does that mean.  it means i look smart.  okay, you're a smart toaster.  kate likes them.  don't you, kate.   i hope this isn't the reaction i get at school.   arthur read, school is not a joke.  now take those glasses off this instant.   i can't.  they're stuck.  if you insist on clowning around, i'll just have to put you in a more suitable class.   helmut: since artaud is our newest clown, he has to get fifi to jump through the hoop.  my name is arthur, and i'm not a clown.      another populous country in asia is korea.  arthur, would you point out seoul on the map.  is it here.  no, that's somewhere in orbit.  arthur, why aren't you wearing your glasses.  oh.  i, uh, guess i forgot.   it's okay, you can all laugh.  i know they look ridiculous.  i don't think they look ridiculous.  they're very chic.  distinguished, even.  yeah, well, i think they make you look like a... a...  aw, i can't come up with anything.  buster: and then the squid wrapped its tentacles around the ship and...  is there something out there.  no, just an interesting... squirrel.  oh.  well, anyway, the only one who survived was this cabin boy who...  are you listening to me.  i'm telling you about an episode ofamazing aquatic adventures.   i am, i am.  fern: hey, arthur.  just wanted to say, i really like your glasses.  oh. thanks.  it sure beats bumping into things.   you know, i never realized how funny you are.  can i join you.  um, sure.  we weren't doing anything.  arthur, i need your advice.  daddy's taking me to the opera tonight.  which one do you think i should wear.  why are you askinghim.  because arthur obviously has a very keen sense of fashion.  just look at those glasses.  so. retro chic or sleek and sassy.  um, well, i always say, "what's old is new." you're so right.  the stripes are much better.  you don't say that.  i just said it.  great choice, muffy.  you can go, girl.  it's "you go, girl." there's no "can" in it.  hop in.  i'll drive you home.   arthur: hey, brain, what's the "scoop".   the scoop is i'm getting creamed.  i'm down by two pieces and he has my queen pinned.  any advice.  well, i always say, "the best defense is good offense." when have you ever said that before.  hmm.  you may have a point.  check.  forced mate in 12.   thanks.  i didn't even know you played chess.  he doesn't.  he plays checkers, and i win half the time.  help yourself to a brainfrost.  thanks.  what about me.  don't i get a brainfrost.  sorry.  i can only give out one free one a day.    arthur's with a patient right now.  come back later.  a patient.  sometimes i just feel like people think i'm weird.  well, george, i always say, "it takes one to know one." you mean, if they think i'm weird, then it's becausethey'reweird.  exactly.  i'm afraid our time is up.  you're in good hands.  he's an amazing therapist.  you're not a therapist.  you're just a kid with fancy glasses.  can we talk about this later.  i have to go to sue ellen's and give her a drawing lesson.  but she's a much better artist than you.  well, i always say, "teaching is a great way to learn." you have never said that in your entire life.   hey, ramon, love the shirt.  lookin' sharp, grandma tibble.  mr. manino, keep it real.  what, these.  yeah, they're new.  but i always say, "it's not what you wear, it's how you wear it." hehheh. yeah.     yo, whassup.  jenna, you working hard or hardly working.  binkster, ready for that quiz.  gman, need to talk.  'cause the doctor is in, buddy.  what happened to your glasses.  oh. i, uh, dropped them.  but that's all right, 'cause i always say...  buster: "if you can't beat 'em, join 'em." buster, why are you wearing those.  these aremynew glasses.  guess you're not the only kid with a new look.  well, it's a terrible look.  you should take them off right now.  i don't know.  i think they're kind of original.  but... they're not even glasses.  they're ski goggles.  at least they're in one piece.  i think someone's a little jealous, 'cause they're no longer the only player in the framegame.  but watch out.   are you okay.   now they both look ridiculous.  oh, by the way, the blackandwhite dress was a disaster.   i promise never to let a pair of glasses change my personality.  oh, and never to start a sentence with, "well, i always say..." again.  i promise never to wear ski goggles.  unless i'm skiing.  what should we do now.  now you have to help me get home.  i can't see a thing.  and now...  marc brown: the idea for pal came when we wanted to get a pet at our house, and i invented a pet that arthur could have.  i start with this oval shape, and then i give him eyes and a little triangle for his nose, and pal's a pretty happy dog, so we'll make him smiling.  then we'll add his ears.  now we'll give him his collar, and he's off for an adventure.  announcer: pbs kids + "peg + cat," where sometimes the fun starts with a problem.  counting 100 rocks will take all day.   oh, jeez.  announcer: "peg + cat,"weekdays on pbs kids or anytime at pbskids.org.  forarthurwithcaptioningis by...  the best time to play is anytime.  chuck e. cheese's isa proud sponsor of pbs kids.  and by contributionsto your pbs station from: to watch morearthur and play games with allof the elwood city friends, visit pbskidsgo.org.  you can find arthur books at your local library.   what a wonderful kind of day    hey. what a wonderful kindof day   ey  both: tada.  announcer: pbs kids wants you ..   with the wild kratts.  kratts: activate dragonfly power.  announcer: where every day you can walk like a croc, buzz around with some bees, and channel your inner mouse.  squeak, squeak, squeak, squeak.  how is that a mouse, bro.  ha ha ha.  what's going on here.  go on animal adventureswith the wild kratts every weekday on pbs kids or anytimeon the pbs kids video app. )
