 hey.  whoa.   announcer: somewhere, in the ancient ruins of egypt lies a horror buried deep beneath the desert sands, an unnatural force, bent on destruction, not dead, not alive, and nothing can stop them.    the new video game from the makers of "extreme gamma cube""dark bunny: revenge of the moomies." yes, it's moomies as you've never seen them before.  they're bigger, they're badder, and they're much, much madder.  it's milking time.  cool. cool.  i've got to have that.  hey...  but how are you going to afford it.  i could ask my parents for it, but they'll just say, "if you really want it, you'll have to buy it with your own money."  if i bought everything i ever wanted, i'd have to have so many jobs, i'd never have time to play with the things i bought.  just like grownups.  hey, i know how you can buy that game. come on.  just like i figured.  you are sitting on a gold mine.  i don't get it.  it's just a bunch of junk no one plays with anymore. shh.  not junk... merchandise.  buster: you can sell this stuff on the school newspaper's web site.  they've got a section for online ads.  hey, i remember these.  anyway, you write a description of what you want to sell, set up a contact box at the paper and submit it.  but who's going to want this old stuff.  you'd be surprised.  some people will buy anything.   how much you want for it.  this is going to be easy.      nice job, honey.  what you doing.  writing an ad.  i'm selling my old toys on the school's online newspaper.  .  i hope whoever buys this stuff likes stinky toys.  hey.  d.w.  okay, okay, but that hippo needs a bath.  arthur: for sale...  lots of old toys.  if interested, email toyguy22.   computer: toyguy22, you have no mail.   computer: toyguy22, you have no mail.   no mail... no mail... no mail... no mail.  i don't get it.  why isn't anything selling.  i'll tell you why.  there's no oomph, no pizzazz.  you don't sell the steak. you sell the sizzle.  i told you muffy would be able to help.  but i'm selling toys.  exactly.  : "for sale: lots of old toys".  hohum.  you'll never make a sale with that pitch.  i thought it was okay.  "okay" doesn't move merchandise.  you need "spectacular." who's your target market.  what about product branding.  where's the eye candy.  eye candy.  boy, do i have my work cut out for me.  a picture is worth a hundred words.  you mean a thousand.  nah. this camera only has three megapixels.  layout is important.  an ad's got to be easy to read, with bright colors that grab the buyer's attention.  now description.  adjectives are key.  but you can't say just anything.  you need to know the lingo.  for instance, you don't say "old." you say "retro." you don't say "banged up." you say "wellloved." and if something's a total wreck, you say "needs tlc," or "handyman special." buster: wow, you made all that in one day.  i sold just about everything.  even the woogle.  yeah, they needed it to complete their set.  and they paid you money for it.  arthur: i've got some merchandise that isn't moving, but i figure all i need is the right hook.  muffy: okay, no more mr. nice guy.  it's time to pull out the aggressive tactics: celebrity endorsements.  hmm. hmm.  arthur: celebrity endorsements.  you think bionic bunny really loves zippy doodles.  he's paid to say that.  don't tell buster. it'd crush him.  so who do you know who's famous.  uh... beauregard poulet.  yeah, he might work if you're selling chickens.  come on, we need someone really famous.  that's it.  i don't know anyone else.  okay, let's move on to raves.  muffy: a rave is when you drum up business in chat rooms or by talking on a phone where people can overhear you about some product, saying how great it is, blah, blah, blah.  i'd do it for you, but you can't afford my fee.   hey, i thought you'd like to know where you can get some really cool toys.  toyguy22 is selling stuff  you can't get anywhere else.  and the prices are super cheap.  why are you yelling about yourself.   these toys aren't selling, pal.  i'm not any good at raves.  and i can't afford to hire muffy to do them.  ugh, d.w.'s right.  it is kind of smelly.  hmm.  stuffed hippo for sale.  smells just like the real thing.   i can't say it's broken.  no one will buy that.  wait. i know.  robotron for sale.  perfect for display.  oh, i've got it.  toy soldiers for sale.  new, larger size.  what a bargain.  larger size.  all you did was put it in a bigger box.  d.w., you just don't understand marketing.  maybe. but i sure know what lying sounds like.  it's not lying.  it's advertising.  wow.  this is so cool.  well, that's the last of your inventory.  congratulations.  whoohoo.  i've got enough money for moomies.  you must be the world's greatest salesman.  i mean, how did you get james to buy a robotron that loses its arms and legs every time you move it.  well, i sort of left that part out of my ad.  but i said it was for display purposes.  hey, arthur, there's something wrong with this robotron.  yeah, it kind of does that.  arthur just forgot to mention it.  but don't worry.  arthur will give you your money back.  right, arthur.  technically, arthur, you are under no obligation to return any funds.  as long as arthur didn't lie, james doesn't have a leg to stand on.  neither does his robotron.  you're going to give him his money back, right.  let the buyer beware, i always say.  arthur. you can't do that.  i said "display purposes." come on. think how we felt when we bought some toy that wasn't what we thought it would be.  like those sea squirrels. remember.  arthur: that doesn't look like a squirrel.  it looks like something my baby sister spit up.  but it's not like i said, you know, "action figure" or something.  i said, "for display purposes." it's bad enough when grownups cheat kids, but when kids cheat kids, it's like a total meltdown of the fabric of our society.  and who needs melty fabric.  don't worry, james.  i'm pretty good at fixing broken toys.  i've broken tons of them.  thanks.  i suppose your ad could be considered misleading.  at most, it's a misdemeanor.  the worst you'd get is house arrest.  house arrest.  uh... wait.  i just want to look at something.  i'll be right back.  good one, james. good aim.  couldn't fix it, huh.  nah. but buster thought up a really good game to play with it.  it's called robotron arm toss.  you try to get his arm to shoot off and hit the bull'seye.  cool.  so, did you get your moomy game.  nope. i got something even better.  here you go, james.  i'm really sorry about everything.  thanks, arthur.  but what about the moomies.  i'm sure we'll get to play it someday.  muffy: i just had to see what all the fuss was about.  deep voice: who dares approach the tomb of nocaloreeti.  all: we do.  deep voice: you've been warned.  prepare to meet your moomy.  muffy: that's it.  that's all you get for $35.95.  the sea squirrels were better than this.  well, if you ever need someone to sell it for you, don't call me.  deep voice: game over. game over. game...  buster:  you're in them, you shoot them    you make them, it's "postcards from you."   and now, a video from you.   it's "postcards from you."   this "postcard from you" was made by jamie, kade and manhal in henderson, nevada.  all: bring the ocean to the desert.  come on in. we have an ocean in the desert.  this is where we keep all of our aquatic animals.  there are no oceans near the desert, especially where we live, because there are no oceans near.  i love sharks.  i think they're very cool.  the puffer fishlooks really nice but, when it gets mad,it looks like this.  all: bye.  our next postcard comes from kids at the delano optional school in memphis, tennessee.  hey, buster, this is my friend khalik.  we're going to take him to get some ribs, because he's been dreaming of ribs all day.   i love ribs    take a bite, you'll want some ribs.   somebody say ribs.  come on. let's go.  all:do you have ribs here.  yes, we have plenty of ribs. come on in.  yay.  do you think people in memphis really like ribs. of course. they love ribs in memphis.  memphis is the home base of ribs.   ribs, ribs are the best    take a bite, you'll want the rest.   buster:to see more "postcards from you," visit:  hello.  oh, hi, thora.  the movies.  : oh, i'd love to.  oh, but i'd have to find a sitter gotcha.  for the boys. i got you first.  the last one quit.  i don't know why.  timmy: come on, tommy.  it's my turn to wear the spaghetti.  tommy: no.   extreme sitters.  no, i've never heard of them.  i'll look at their web site and call you right back.  hmm.  gus grim, child trainer.  like all pack animals, children want to know who's in charge.  that's why i believe in setting the ground rules early on.  oh, my.  that seems a little harsh.  how about shelley, the singing sitter.   if you're naughty and you know it, you should stop.   please.   if you're naughty and you know it, you should stop.   pretty please.   if you're naughty and you know it    you should really try to forego it    if you're naughty and you know it, you should stop.   i'm asking nicely.  hey, is that our new babysitter.  i'd like to fill her shoes with pudding.  me first. i'm going to get you.    timmy: run for your life.  hi, thora.  i, um, think i'll be staying home tonight.   thanks anyway.    d.w.: okay, so the pigs will go here and the chickens here, and now the organical farm is all ready.  wait.  i have one more animal.  what's that.  ferdie the flying bull fromcirco de la luna.  that's the live show we took my grandmere to for grandparents' day.  she had such a good time.    yeah, well, i made my grandma a card with my very own hands and she said it was the best card she'd ever gotten.  so there.  tommy: tractor coming through. aah.   we thought you might want some more dirt for your farm.  vroom.  thanks a lot.  what did you two do for your grandma on grandparents' day.  grandparents' day.  we didn't even know there was one.  typical.  well, you missed it.  it was last sunday.  gee, timmy, do you think grandma's upset.  i don't know.  we could plan something nice for her this weekend.  yeah, like take her to a wrestling match.  body slam.    gotcha.  maybe you should do something thatshewould like.   tommy & timmy: charge.   man : come to trattoria molto denaro.  the best italian dining in all of elwood city.  perfect for that special occasion or just to say "thank you" to that special someone.  grazie.  that's it, timmy.  let's take grandma to that fancy restaurant.  okay. we have three dollars saved up.  that should be enough.  let's tell her now.  no. let's make it...  a surprise.  surprise.  : oh.  breakfast in bed.  how lovely.  careful, dear.  this isn't even the real surprise, grandma.  we're going to take you out to a fancy restaurant to make up for missing grandparents' day.  oh, that's very sweet.  but maybe we should do something else.  remember the last time we went to a restaurant.  hey, you're hogging all the sauce.  oops.   oops, yourself.    got you.  no way, i got you first.  no, you didn't. yes, i did.    that was a great dinner.  yeah.  hey, we can go there if you want.  why don't we just have a cake at home.  she didn't want to go to a restaurant.  i can't figure out why.    probably because you two are slobs.  no, we're not.  are we.  you're the slobbiest slobs i've ever met.  if you want to eat in a restaurant, you need table manners.  you know, like eating with a fork and knife.  using a napkin, that sort of thing.  okay, so teach us.  forget it.  i'm done teaching tibbles.  fine, we'll just teach ourselves.  timmy: but we don't know anything about table manners, tommy.  so. we've seen people eat in restaurants on tv all the time.  we'll just do what they do.  okay, i'll pretend to be grandma.  first, you have to pull my chair out for me, sweetie.  ugh.  not that far, timmy.  oh. sorry, grandma.  great.  now pour me some juice, young man.  into a cup, timmy.  oh, yeah.   aah...  now ask me what i want to eat.  what would you like to eat, grandma.  we have cookies.  would you like them mashed or crumbled.  mashed, please.  they're not quite mashed enough.  let me help you, timmy.  oh, dear.  you got some on your cheek, grandma.  let me wipe it off for you.   ow.  quit it. come on. stop pushing me.  they said they needed to practice their table manners on someone, so they came to me.  don't sweat it, little bro.  i'll keep them in line.   no, let me.  you first, james.  uh, thanks.  here's your napkin.  i'll have a root beer, no ice, no straw, please.  what about for you, gentlemen.  ice cream.  you scream.  we all scream we all scream for ice cream. for ice cream.  molly: okay, we're out of here.  but... now.  hey, wait, that's not fair.  we were doing everything right.  i let james sit first, didn't i.  yeah, and i gave him his napkin.  but then what.  you started shouting at the top of your lungs.  so.  so, would you like it if there was someone shouting next to you while you tried to eat..  no.  me neither.  table manners are about being aware of the people around you and thinking about what they'd like.  how do we know what that is.  we're not mind readers.  you got to look for the signs.  tommy: we're not used to doing that.  yeah. if we do that, we probably won't be able to take grandma out to dinner until we're grownups.  just remember these three things: stop, look, listen.  you'll get the hang of it.   i saw it first. no, i did.  gimme.  wait.  we're forgetting something.  stop.  look.  listen.  shh.   thank you, tommy.    are you ready.  i think so.  okay.   let's try it.  grandma.  could we get something to drink.  of course.  now let's see, i think there was a water fountain back that way...  timmy: no.  in there.  grandma: the restaurant..  um...  how about some juice.  i know there's a machine just up...  please, grandma.  we're really thirsty.   and the juice tastes better in there.  well... okay.   you two are awfully quiet.  is everything all right.  uhhuh.  we're just reading signs.  thank you.    i'm really sorry, grandma.  i was trying so hard to be quiet that i didn't see the...  that's okay.  it's just a spill.  it happens to everyone.  here are some more napkins.  you know what.  i think i am going to take you up on that special dinner.  and i know just the place.  grandma: here we are.  wow. wow.  timmy: this is a fancy place.  i'll say.  what if it's too fancy for us.  what if we embarrass grandma.  : just read the signs.  timmy: what kind of sign was that, tommy.  tommy: i don't know that one.  welcome, me lords and lady to "fit for a king".  eat. drink.  and be merry.  argh.  there are no forks and knives.  how are we supposed to eat this.  look.  tommy: with our hands.  grandma, are you sure this is where you wanted to go.  oh, yes.  you boys have been so wellbehaved recently, i thought it might be nice to go somewhere where we can all just... relax a little.  well.  you heard the man.  let's dig in.   hi, i'm marc brown.  i write and illustrate thearthurbooks.  there's a secret about thearthurbooks that i bet you didn't know.  in almost all thearthurbooks, i hide the names of my kids: "tolon," "tucker" and "eliza." this is probably one of the hardest to find the name hidden.  if you look very carefully on arthur's desk, the pencil holder has eliza's name.  the other names are hidden on the ends of these baby beds in the hospital.  see if you can find their names.  captioned by media access group at wgbh access.wgbh.org visit us online at: you can findarthurbooksand lots of other books, too, at your local library.
