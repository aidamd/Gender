 arthur: hey, d.w.  hey.  whoa.    elwood city times.  stevens here.  what.  i'll be right there.  murphy, grab your camera.  we just got a hot tip.  i don't know what happened.  one minute she seemed normal.  the next, she was a monster.  i guess she sort of snapped.   how could she do this to me.   after all i've done for her.   did you get my profile.    i'm telling you, it's the aliens.  what else could explain it.  they're controlling her mind through her tooth fillings.  great work, boys.  i'm making it our lead story.  what..  "frensky frames friends".  that's a dirty rotten lie.  aah.  ratburn: good morning, class.  you can put away your books.  there'll be no school today.   arthur, pinch me.  i'm dreaming.  instead, you'll all be going to work.  um, excuse me, mr. ratburn but i think that's against child labor laws.  you won't actually be working, alan.  you will spend the day with someone else's parent at their workplace.  can i go to brain's mom's ice cream shop.   you can't all go to the same place so i'm going to pass around this hat and you'll each pick out a name.  "oliver frensky." cool. i'm going to the dump.  "run, don't walk, to crosswire motors." : great.  ha.  i mean... great.   oh... the newspaper.  boring...  nothing interesting ever happens in elwood city.  muffy: if you colorcoordinate your flavors, you'll increase sales.  presentation is everything.  like my daddy always says...  never overestimate the intelligence of the customer, arthur.  i convinced my own cousin to buy a worthless...  brain: the new speedo accounting software is superior to the speed 5.0 i just demonstrated.  to install it, just drag you're old accounting program into the trash.  buster: what does this button do.  no.  first time at a newspaper, francine.  you must be so excited.  come on, i'll show you everything.  the building was built in 1949 of brick and limestone.  and this is a broom closet.  the cafeteria's that way.  the specials are london broil and chicken piccata.  the ceilings are 15 feet tall.  there is a factchecker which is someone who checks facts.  and this... is the news room.  wow.  and now, for a very special treat we're going to send you on an assignment with our top sports reporter: harry mills.  hiya, frensky.  how do you feel about horses.  horses.  i love them.  great.  you're hired.  i lost my photographer today and need someone to shoot the horse race in erie.  harry: so over there is where they bring the horses after the race for the crowning ceremony.  oh, they're starting.  what's that white goat doing on the track.  white goat.  don't think i know that horse.  who's the jockey.    cool.  ms. baxter: who would guess that one goat could cause so much trouble.  it's lucky we had francine there to get these photos.  you're an ace reporter, frensky.  this one will go very nicely on the front page of tomorrow's sports section.  francine mr. mills and ms. baxter said i was an ace reporter.  so i've decided to share my talent by starting my own paperthe frensky star with the help of my dad's old camera and his reporting cap.  ratburn: thank you, francine.  that was quite a story.  i can't wait to see your first installment.  oh.   francine, i definitely can wait untilafterclass.  sorry.  okaytypewriter, pads, pencils, camera.  i'm all set.  now all i need is a story.  katherine: the news room.  what on earth have you done to my room.  it's my room, too.  and now it's also the headquarters of an important newspaper.  have you completely lost your mind.  i want this junk out of here now.  hey. that's not junk.  that's my research.  i have a job to do.  the only job you have to do is to keep your grubby, little hands away from my stuff you pesky little...  that was great.  how about a little more rage.  give me that camera.  sorry, charlie.  this is great copy.  francine: thanks, muffy.  don't mention it.  daddy and i are supportive of the media.  and it's free advertising.  thanks, gordy.  put it on the account.   thisisan embarrassing picture, even for katherine.  we better make sure mr. ratburn doesn't see this.   "katherine cracks." arthur: she looks like a werewolf.  binky: i like the next one.  "no ifs, ands or buts." this is great, francine.  you really make the news interesting.  you thinkthisis good.  wait till you see what else i have.  very interesting.  ah. there's a cute "wittle wabbit." arthur: two hours of my lifewasted.  i'd rather have been doing math homework.  it's your fault, arthur.  you lost the bet.  i told you that nadine could hold her breath for two hours.  d.w., your imaginary friend doesn't even have breath to hold.  you tricked me into playing that...  all right, you two.  arthur, next time you can pick the movie and you'll get an extra large popcorn.  yes.  well, it worked with the goat.  okay, nemo, just like i told you.    where'd your mom get all this stuff anyway.  muffy: tadah.  what do you think.  oh, i need pearls with this.  what was that.  uh, was that lightning.  must be a storm coming.  got to go.  thanks, gordy.  put it on the account.   "arthur's love formary moo cow".  d.w. tricked me into seeing that dumb movie.  muffy: i would never wear polka dots and stripes together.  we were kidding around.  yeah, and i thought i was petting a rat.  francine: hey, guys.  anything interesting in the papers.  the crosswires are officially withdrawing their funding.  nobody say another word, muffy.  it might be printed in that ragthe frensky star.  hey, i just tell it like it is.  can i sit here.  all: no comment.  oh, this is ridiculous.  how long will i get the silent treatment.  all: no comment.  but it isn't fair.  i didn't make up those stories.  i just reported them.  what do you want me to do.  you could print an article saying those photos were out of context.  mmm... i don't think so.  that's not a very good story.  huh. i can't eat here with the tabloids hounding me like this.  arthur, brain, care to join me.   ratburn: you left out all the commas.  a journalist should at least try to use proper grammar.     what.  who....      this is the lowest of the low.  this isn't news.  it's just revenge.   we didn't do anything, francine.  honest.  yeah, but we wish we did.  aha. i knew it was you all along, buster.  you were jealous of the praise i got from harry and your mom.  you're even passing them out.  these. i just picked them up off the floor.  ever since my day with your dad i see garbage everywhere.  arthur.  really, francine, it wasn't us.   even we don't work that fast.  ratburn: nice work, francine.  it takes character to be able to poke fun at yourself.  looks like the "ace reporter" is a laughing stock.  i think i'll call this story "pesky sister gets just desserts." you.  you'rethe inquirer.  you think you're the only one with a camera.  but why.  everyone's laughing at me.  so you would know what it feels like.  besides, i didn't want you to lose all your friends.  i think i did that anyway.  don't worry.  tomorrow it'll all be yesterday's news.  how do you know.  that's what happened when i was an annoying thirdgrader and photographed all my friends.  wow. my two daughters not fighting for a whole minute.  now, this is a story.  katherine: hands off the can, squirt.  it's minei called it.  i don't care.  i'm older and stronger and it's my soda.  you want a piece of me.  come on, twinkle toes.  i'll never let go.  they'll bury me with this soda.  mine, you hear.  and now...  kids: one, two, three, four.  boy: francine has a newspaper.  well, we do our own news show.  we do the morning news for our school.  everyone in school sees our news.  girl: please tune your tv sets to channel four for the morning news.  boy: good morning...  students, staff, parent volunteers and faculty of the agassiz school.  everyone works together as a team.  i'm jarvus...  and emmins will help me be announcer.  girl: bryce is on graphics.  boy: jeanson is on deck.  girl: lia makes characters.  boy: julia will be our video switcher.  i'm on audio mixer and halima is the phone announcer.  we tell the school what's going on.  lunch for today is baked chicken patty on a bun.  jarvis: we have, like, little pictures of the lunch.  i'm doing this right now.  the main thing for the day is right there.  then we put it below this.  emmins :.. fruit and milk.  and he also announced a summer reading program.  the summer reading program at the cambridge public library will be starting up soon.  i'm glad i found out about that.  the lost and found article for today is...  ...this striped shirt.  that looks like jasper's shirt.  i really like the news show.  it's very interesting.  i love who i am and will always strive to be the best possible me.  both: thank you and have a great learning day.  woman: whoo, good, cut.  off the air.  boy: all right.  woman: have a great day.   kids: and now...  d.w.: so what are we playing today, arthur.  underwater tea party or slowmotion ballet.  haha.  : me, do balletthat's a good one.  you liked doing it last weekend.  and your grand jet is getting a lot better.  you have to play with your own friends today, d.w.  hey, emily, come on in.  the water is deelicious.  i have to finish lunch.  want some of my pat sandwich.  no.  and i wouldn't eat that if i were you.  pat is just a fancy name for liverwurst.  hey, tommy, timmy, want to play "fish".  i'll let you two be the sharks.  sure. just wait till we finish putting on our sunblock.  you missed a spot on your head.  oh, yeah.  well, you missed a spot on your back.   why do i even bother.  d.w.: boring.  i wish something would happen.  wait. i didn't mean it.  i take it back.   honest, it was a joke.   d.w.: stop.  turn around, turn around.  d.w., what's wrong.  this isn't my backpack.  someone stole my backpack.  tadah.  my backpack has "d.w." written on it and that's not a "d," and that's not a "w".  arthur: om... ble.  do you know anyone named omble.  d.w.: i thought these people were my friends.  little did i know, i was swimming with a pack of thieves.  calm down, d.w.  someone probably put it in the lost and found.  mom: we'll have to come back monday.  the office is closed.  but today's saturday.  that's almost two whole days away.  all my important stuff is in that backpack: my glitter, my mary moo cow and my "crazy bus" tape.  what are we going to do.  ve some peace and quiet.  hmph.  d.w.: hey. ow.  looking for my snowball, weren't you.  for the tenmillionth time i did not take your snowball.  well, someone did and now someone took my backpack, too.  who knows what they'll steal from me next.  i should put a lock on these shoes.  arthur, look up omble for me.  it won't be in the phone book, d.w.  it isn't a real name.  "omble" is just nonsense.  that's silly.  why would someone write nonsense on their backpack.  unless they didn't want anyone to know their real name.  this omble is sneakyvery sneaky.  d.w.: think, nadine, think.  who is this omble.  emily. the tibbles.  no. emily's too nice and tommy and timmy aren't smart enough to pull this one off.  we need clues.  what's this.  maybe it's a horn.  you mean like a unicorn's horn.   sweetheart, where is your horn.  it was in my backpack, mom.  but i switched it with d.w.'s.  look what i got insteadglitter.   this means another trip to the horn storeyour third this year.  no, unicorns don't steal. they're good creatures.  maybe those are to hide the omble's sharp, pointy teeth.  you're right.  they're fang hiders.  look, a tiny wall and tiny mountains.  and snow.  i bet this is where omble lives.    he fattens us up on snow turns us into plastic hamburgers and... and feeds us to polly locket dolls.   nadine, i've got to find that backpack before it's too late.  well, there's nothing you can do now.  better get some sleep.  i can't sleep.  mary's about to become a hamburger.  if you were a real friend, you'd stay awake with me.   but i'm not real. i'm imaginary.  d.w.: and he flies around in a black blimp, looking for backpacks to steal.  computer voice: backpack located.  owner: dora winifred read.  contents: plastic cow, "crazy bus" tape, glitter.  glitter.   d.w.: and while everyone is trying to keep their stuff dry a hose comes down and sucks up the backpack.  and he leaves this ugly one in its place.  it's hideous.  mom said i had to babysit you.  she didn't say anything about listening to the world's most boring story.  can i have some more pretend tea.  um, it's all gone, arthur.  there's only one thing to do.  you must find out more about those things in omble's bag.  but how. how..   my brain is melting with boredom.   arthur, that's it.  brain: hmm... yes, fascinating.  it appears to be an earthy substance composed primarily of decomposed igneous and metamorphic rock.  it's clay.  what would omble want with a boring lump of clay.  it's been molded into something.  it kind of looks like the eiffel tower.  the eiffel tower.  that's in france, isn't it.  sothat'swhere omble's hiding.  we better start biking now, arthur.  i want to get there before dinner.  you can't bike to france.  the atlantic ocean is between here and there.  and i forgot to bring the water wings.  but you could talk to buster.  he's actually been to france.  buster: yep, it's a perfect match.  ah, paris... the crepes, the croissants, the french fries.  what's a croissant.  a french roll, shaped like a moon.  you want one.  i saved it from my trip last summer.  did you see anything in france that looked like this.  : no.  what is it.  a xylophone for mice.  i think omble uses them to hide his sharp, pointy teeth.  hey, you might be right about that.  arthur: d.w., once and for all there's no such thing as "fang hiders".  d.w. and buster: then what are they.  they're... they're...  okay, i don't know what they are.  but i know someone who will.   they're called "panpipes." they're from the andes a mountain range in south america.  and i bet this is a souvenir of the great wall of chinaa wall so big and long it can be seen from space.  i've always wanted to go there.  wow. france, south america, chinaomble has been everywhere.  yep. he sounds like a very interesting person.  okay, so whoever has your bag is not a monster just someone who's been to a lot of places.  can we go home now.  just one more stop.  we are not going to the andes.  the criminal always returns to the scene of the crime, arthur.  excuse me, sir. )
