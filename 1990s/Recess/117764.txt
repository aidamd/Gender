 guys, i say we build ourselves a fort.  a fort.  i'm surprised we didn't think of it sooner.  fun of epic proportions.  my friends, cast your peepers upon yonder work and swell up with proudness.  ..fort tender.  man, fort living is where it's at.  building this old girl was maybe the best idea we ever had.  who thought being inside during recess could be so cool.  it's changed my life.  even when i do the same stuff i used to, if i do it in here, it's like doing new stuff.  i heartily agree with you, ..i think.  what ho, my fine fort fellows.  from up here, the view is inspirational indeed.  not only that, but building on high ground makes it impossible for enemies to sneak up.  fort tender is just what we need a place of our own for the ages.   fort tender, here we come.  last one there is menlo's granny.    oh, man.  i'malways menlo's granny.  don't worry, gus.  it'll feel completely different being a granny ..  if i can ever get the gate open.  why, it looks like we got visitors.  lawson, you got no business being in there.  fort tender is ours, so get out and let us in.  what's that.  "fort tender".  sorry, but i don't know what you're talking about, 'cause this here is fort fort.  first lawson busts into our cool new fort and then gives it the lamest name in history.  enough fooling around, lawson.  open the door and give us back our fort.  oh, i'll give you something, ..  ..  wetweiler.  what's the matter, wetweiler.  can't you take asoak.  who you got hiding in there, lawson.  come out, you cowards.  fellas, come on up and give our visitors a proper fort fort welcome.  fire.  take cover.    attacked by our own fort.  that's just plain wrong.  we got to get them out of there.  my uncle manny drives a bulldozer.  but that would wreck our own fort.  i suggest we write a scathing editorial and stir up a decidedly antilawson sentiment throughout the community.  writing something would take i say we talk to king bobnow.  and so, as we sat studying in class, lawson and his band of fifthgrade thugs willfully sneaked into fort tender and usurped it.  the facts are clear.  reason must prevail.  you make a compelling argument, smart girl.  i like the use of these plastic spacemen.  however, the law of the playground is against you.  what. it can't be.  surely you can't be serious.  zzzow. boom.  oh, but i am quite serious.  i believe the technical term " finders keepers.  but that's not fair.  perhaps not, but it is my ruling.  servants.  to the playground.  i wish to take in a game of duck, duck, goose.  zzzow. boom.  i must confess, this weakens my faith in our playground's judicial system.  and it strengthens my resolve.  guys, i say we're taking back fort tender, and we're taking it by force.   as long as we stay up against this wall, they can't hit us with balloons.  then we've made it.  what now, teej.  now you get wet from behind. ha ha.  aah.  aah.  aw, man.   those seemed like such a harmless idea during construction.  that place is impossible to attack.  this madness must be stopped.  surely they cannot be so evil that reason will not sway them.  no. mikey.  oh, lawson, we share the sun, we share the rain.  why, we share delight in the antics of therow open your doors, and let us share the fort.  in the name of humanity, i beseech you.  what will be your answer.   looks like we need another plan something sneakier.  this is the life.  i can do nothing and feel like i'm doing something.  menlo:attention, lawson and his buddies.  please report to the office at once.  at once.  we better get going.  hang on, guys. not so fast.  your mothers are here to see you.  please don't keep your mothers waiting.  your mothers have brought you brownies and grilled cheese sandwiches.  why, as i speak, they're feeding some to me.  it is very good, lawson and friends.  wouldn't you like some.  grilled cheese.  your mommies miss you.  come to the office and give them a hug.  it will make them so very happy.  now hel of you to enjoy.  remember this one.   i got to go.  me, too.  mom's waiting for me.   grilled cheese.  no. wait.  it's a trick, i tell you.  jocko, your mom's hauling gravel crosscountry today, and, buster, your mom's oncall at the shoe store.  they couldn't possibly be in the office.  gus:hey, t.j., the song ended.  you want me to flip it over.  how come you look so mad all of a sudden.  this great plan to fake out lawson is going perfect.  sorry for ruining our great plan.  that's okay, gus.  it was an accident.  man, this whomps.  we tried king bob.  we tried attacking the fort.  we even tried psychological warfare.  nothing's working.  perhaps we should just give up.  ..  ain't no way i'm giving up.  i think giving up isexactlywhat we should do.  there's nothing lawson likes better than winning.  especially since it never happens.  i propose we make him think he's done just that.  we'll take a page from history.  according to homeric legend, the greeks used trickery to end their 10year siege of the city of troy.  they pretended to give up and, as a gift, left behind the trojan horse.  and this horse, it kicked down the walls.  was it carnivorous.  no, gus.  it was made of wood.  you'll understand as we go along.  suffice it to say, we need a gift.  it has to be something that even lawson can't resist, and i think i know just the thing.  alarm. alarm.  aoogah. aoogah.  hey, you stop right there.  what do you think you're doing.  lawson, we've come to surrender.  we're simply no match for your superior strength and fifthgrade intellect.  fort fort is yours to keep.   hang on just one minute.  now, where are detweiler, spinelli, and lasalle.  they're behind the handball wall crying.  now, that's more like it.  indeed, lawson, we were wrong to challenge your claim to fort fort.  please accept our humble offering, a gift for you and your friends to enjoy.  whoa.  whoa.  a minisub.  it's the fantasy of every kid to own a submarine.  hey, didn't somebody once say "beware of geeks bearing gifts".  you're out of your brain.  that submarine is our passport for being underwater.  now open the door and bring it in.  way to go, men.  fort fort is ours for the ages, and so is the submarine.  i christen yous.s. sub.   and i christen you, thegood ship loser.   run for your lives.  aah.  aah.  yeah.  we did it.  all right.  yay.  yes.  yay.  did you see the look on lawson's face.  i didn't know carillo could move that fast.  taking back this fort was the most fun in the history of playground fun.  that it was, gus.  that it was.  what do we do now.  it's back to sitting around.  just us and fort tender.  that would be the easiest thing to do, but would it be the funnest.  making the fort and getting it back were funner than having it.  you could say it was a challenge.  you thinking what i'm thinking.  let's do it.  hey, lawson.  aw, great.  what do you want, detwinner.  nice fort.  bet you can't take it back.  we'll just see about that.    them.  one of the blobs just split in two.  now he has double attack power.  pardon, t.j.  might i see the blobs.  hang on, mikester.  i just got to see one thing.  ah, the life cycle of the common bacterium.  i remember my first view of a singlecell microorganism.  this is so cool.  bacteriums rock.  , i really would like to see the little blobs.  hold your horses, big guy.  ..second.  thank you.  wow. they're beautiful.  like tiny balloons caressed by the breeze.  care to peer into their world, gretchen.  through an underpowered school scope.  no, thank you, mikey.  i'm already familiar with germs.  did you say germs.  i thought teej called them bacteriums.  germs andbacteria the correct pluralization of bacterium are the same thing.  they are. aah.  relax, gus.  those things are harmless.  harmless.  don't you watch tv, man.  germs aren't harmless.  they're little scary creatures that cause decay and disease.  you must've seen that 12hour special about microorganisms on the science channel.  no, but i've seen mouthwash commercials.  i don't think these things are going to hurt anyone.  they're between two microscope slides.  we're probably safe as long as they're trapped there.  trapped.  don't worry, little ones.  i'll get you out.  are you nuts.  don't let those things loose in here.  but germs are living creatures.  they should be as free to dance and frisk about as you and i.  don't you dare let those things out.  there's no reason to worry about the few germs on that slide.  there are billions of germs everywhere.  evevevnot helping.  there are billions of germs living on your skin now.  my skin.  aah.   i wonder where gus went to.  those germs really freaked him out.  my little friends wouldn't hurt anyone.  that's why i'll give them gentle names.  you're hattie, you're cecil, and you're joshua.  and you're dented.  wait a sec. i've got a hunch.  excuse me, ladies.  ..get...clean.  ..get...clean.  i think gustav's going to need a little more time with this whole "germs all over his skin" thing.  who's ready for some bball.  let's do it.  no, thank you, t.j.  i promised my tiny friends that i'd show them around the playground.  maybe i'll take my slide on the slide.  gus isn't the only kid around here with germ issues.  where is gus, anyway.  hi, guys.  what's with the funky raincoat.  it's a biological hazard suit.  in here, i'm completely protected from any and all foreign germs.  gus, don't you think you're overreacting a bit.  i mean, you can't even see germs.  that's my point.  they can be anywhere.  do you know where that ball has been, what kid has sneezed on it, or worse.  ha. here, vince. catch.  guys, allow me to clear up a few misconceptions.  there's no reason to ahchoo.  ah. sorry.  as i was saying ahchoo.  ahchoo.  excuse me.  i think i need to see the nurse.  suddenly, i'm not feeling so well.  see.  those hideous germs got gretchen.  gus, why don't you forget all this germ junk, take off that futuristic getup, and come play some bball.  no can do, teej.  i won't rest until my fellow students are safe from this vicious, unchecked menace.  i must spread the word.  so, like, i'm all, "as if," " i'd like to speak to you about germs.  ew. youarea germ.  ashleys, scatter.   what's all this, gus.  having trouble getting your message of impending doom out.  no one wants to face this problem headon.  what you need is ..  or a photocopy machine.  where am i going to get one of those.  i have access to one, but i'll need one of those nifty suits in return 22 slim, if they've got it.  here you go, menlo.  22 slim.  ah, clean and pressed, unlike germs.  this should prove a more efficient way of getting our message out.  ugh. gross.  what what is that.  itwasa kid's toe until germs had their way with it.  if kids on the playground saw that picture, they'd really understand wh i'm talking about.  indeed. follow me.  push the button, gus, ..  to life.  ew.  gross.  wake up, 3rd street.  there is an invisible menace among us.  you today ofgerms.  they have already claimed gretchen grundler, and i ask you, if our best and brightest are not safe, who among us is.  surgical gloves and masks.  five comics a pair.  get them while they're uncontaminated.  we must take action before it's too late.  we must eliminate germs from our classroom, our pavement, and from our play apparatus.  children: stop the germs.  stop the germs.  i hate to admit it, but gus is starting to make a little sense.  you see that picture.  that was nasty.  i say let's kick some germ butt.  excuse me, but it's time someone spoke up for those who cannot speak.  when these germs have been eliminated, we will lead the childhood of our dreams.  do you hear me.  we will live our dreams.  live our dreams.  live our dreams.  fellow 3rd streeters, i'd like to say a few words to you on behalf of our willowy friends the germs.  did he say the germs were our friends.  get off the stage, germfriender.  you'd like germs, too, if you got to know them.  what have they ever done to you.  try asking gretchen grundler.  oh, wait. you can't.  she's homesick.  she's home sick.  you're making a terrible mistake.   friends, forget everything that boy said.  let's all remember the real enemies are the evil, vile germs.  down with germs.  down with germs.  down with germs.  down with germs.  what a sight.   it does an old heart good.  how do we know when we've gotten rid of the germs.  that's easy, vince.  ..  ..  i have no idea.  good news, gus.  the petition i filed was approved.  disinfectant trucks should arrive within the hour.  operation sterile thunder is go.  excellent.  first, we disinfect the 3rd street playground, and then we'll disinfect the world.   attention, please.  all children must evacuate the area immediately.  disinfectant spraying will only begin when the area is clear.  germs, germs, go away.  we don't want you.  spray, spray, spray.  how long before we can go back out and play.  you gotta wait three days.  this spray is tough on fabric and unprotected skin.  no way.  pipe down.  if it's got to be done, it's got to be done.  time to make my play.   blow, horn, blow.  i listen only to my heart.  what's the holdup, buddy.  why aren't your people spraying.  easy there, junior.  it's a crazy rule, but we can't start spraying till every last kid is off the playground.  him again. ugh.  mikey, you're holding up degermification.  get out of the way.  in the immortal words of mahatma gandhi, make me.  ..  you can't sit there forever.  we'll never abandon our germ friends.  isn't that right, ..  and whoever else you may have divided into.  do you have any idea how dumb you look talking to that slide.  and i suppose wearing that goofy plastic suit makes you look brilliant.  give me those germs, mikey. mikey.  no.  look what you've done.  hattie. cecil.  dear, sweet joshua.  speak to me.  gee, mikey.  i didn't mean to.  i mean this isexactly what you meant to do.  and why.  just because the germs are smaller than you.  that's no reason to destroy them.  think about it.  i'm way bigger.  should i destroy you.   are you insane.  i could get a runny nose or malaria.  give me back my mask.  it isn't safe.  only if you call off your germ squad.  never.    gretchen, you're alive.  thank goodness you're here.  gus has gone crazy.  he's trying to kill all our beautiful bacteria.  tell him to stop.  no, tell him germs made you sick, and now we really must disinfect the world.  actually, you're both behaving ridiculously.  huh.  but what about the beauty of all living things.  and your horrible germy disease.  yes, it's true.  germs made me sick, but the fact that i caught a cold, doesn't mean you should disinfect the world.  germs are everywhere.  learn to live with them.  see.  mikey, stop acting as if bacteria were your pets.  they're singlecelled organisms without legs or eyes or even a brain.  i kind of knew that.  but germs made you sick.  that's just plain bad.  and they made me healthy again, too, with something called antibiotics, which are essentially bacteria that help the body fight illness.  germs aren't bad orgood.  they're simply a part of life.  some are harmful, but others are used to make medicine, yogurt, even cheese.  i love cheese.  so do i.  gus, i got carried away.  not as far away as me, buddy.  friends.   i guess that's a yes.  please disregard all i have said about germs and come out and play.   used to make cheese.  boy, you learn something new every day, huh, bart.   captions paid for by abc cable networks group ohh.  grrr.  hee hee hee.  don't you love a day like this.  so calm, so peaceful.   ohh. humans.  ..  ha ha. you missed me.  whoa.  grab him. watch it.  ha ha. missed again.  is it dangerous.  it caused a lot of commotion.   it's perfectly obvious, darling.  it's a hat.  a very chione athat.  ..  aah. get this horrid thing off me.  get it off. get it off.  this thing is a menace.  and it's not my color.  ..mmhmm...  aha, yes. that's definitely what it is.  what.  a contraption to carry one " " allow me to demonstrate.  ohh. ooh. ahh.  a simple matter of physics.  no big mystery. no danger.  aah.  is that point "a" or point "b".  i think he missed the point completely.  how do you figure this thingamajigger.  ahh.  your majesty, what is that thing.  .. from up there.  what is it, daddy.  it's human. that's all you need to know.  i knew that. me, too.  don't you realize humans are evil.  evil as the evil manta.  maybe eviler.  whatever humans drop into the sea is dangerous.  fish hooks to
