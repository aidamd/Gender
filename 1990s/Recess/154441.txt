ye.  the mighty and honorable king bob will now speak.  kids of the playground, news has reached me of a strange game that has spread across the playground, a game called abimko.  ajimbo.  it has taken over the monkey bars and swept across the sandboxes.  you've thrown aside dodgeball and jumprope to play this instead.  even my own carriers have whoa abandoned me.  and so i got one question to ask can i play.  it's quiet out there, too quiet.  randall, find out what's going on.  randall. randall.  ya ha ha ha. ajimbo.  man, talk about a game for sissies.  oh, i've lost my chartreuse giraffe.  it doesn't even make sense.  i mean, some of the rules are completely inconsistent.  we're steering clear of it, right, guys.  gus: ajimbo.  all: gus.   ha ha ha.  the green snake, too.  gus, what are you doing.  playing ajimbo.  it's great, t.j.  one minute you're on top.  you've got the black lion, the spotted eagle, the purple panther, then pow.  somebody puts down the brown turtle, and it's all over.  then you realize the gray monkey is perfect here.  they think they got you, but you put it down, and ajimbo.  come on, man.  you're going cold turkey.  no, it's a gold turkey.  i've found my calling, and it's ajimbo.  all: ajimbo.  he was so young, so innocent, and now he's gone.  you're overreacting.  am i.  you saw what happened.  i'm telling you, that game changes kids.  guys, you'll never guess what happened.  gus bought out half of kelso's gum supply.  he can't afford lunch.  gretchen's playing ajimbo.  i'll play the white dove.  what, is she crazy.  that's worthless.  well, i'll play the red bear.  just as i expected.  the orange cheetah. no.  gretchen, you've got to be kidding.  it's simple mathematics.  see, i played the white dove, which means she has no choice but to ajimbo.  but it can't be.  i had a system.  i had a system.  this is bad, vince, real bad.  first gus, then gretchen.  who's next you. me. spinelli.  tell me again how ajimbo's really a force for good in the world.  we've got to stop this thing and stop it now.  got any brilliant ideas.  only one we got to take a stand.  hey, what did you do that for.  all of you, you're letting a game take over your lives.  you're fighting like animals over little chunks of plastic.  you've completely forgotten about what's really important, like dodgeball, kickball, and jacks.  remember who you used to be.  no, remember who you are.  look at me, vince, spinelli.  so what do you call this thing, anyway.  the silver owl fits into all kinds of places.  like here.  w. a triple polander.  i didn't see that.  it's right in front of you.  so does this mean i get to pick up all these tiles.  okay, gus i can understand, and mikey, but gretchen and spinelli.  there's only one explanation.  this ajimbo thing must be funner than we thought.  oh, no, vince.  not you, too.  i'm only saying maybe we should give it a chance.  like you've been saying, it's just a game.  see you later.  vince. vince.  next up, the seemingly detweiler, who's been 6 for 6 so far in the series and looks like a shooin for mvp.  the crowd roars, and there he goes.  and next up, who else but t.j. detweiler.   , what's the use.  you can't just play kickball all by yourself.  well, if you can't beat 'em, you might as well join 'em.  ball.  uh, looks like that silver owl blocked your end run strategy, huh, gus.  you've come to join us.  that is good yeah, ii guess it is.  it was inevitable.  here, take a few of my tiles.  i have many yellow chickens.  no, i won't let this thing beat me.  it's no use, t.j.  eventually, you will join us.  never.  you will play.  you will play.  all: he will play.  he will play.  he will play.  he will play.  he will play.  he will play.  he will play.  ball good.  ha ha ha ha.  ow.  wait, i remember that.  we used to play that game, didn't we.  kickball we called that kickball.  we used to throw the ball, then kick it.  then try to catch it.  and run around the bases.  i used to love the jungle gym.  i rememb and the sound of shovels.  how could i forget about jacks.  come on, everybody.  let's go play.   hey, you kindergartners, give us back our ball.  whew. that was close.  hey, guys, wait up.  well, teej, thanks to you, everything's back to normal.  hey, thank those kindergartners.  they reminded us what we'd given up, or were about to.  i'm glad we tossed all the ajimbo pieces in the incinerator.  yeah, yeah, it's beautiful.  enough jabbering already.  let's see who gets first ups.  here, i'll flip a coin.  i thought i got rid of them all.  i don't know about you guys, but i never want to see this thing again.  you got that right.  good riddance.  now let's play some ball.  gretchen: it's about time.  hey, check it out.  huh, looks like some kind of bird.  it's one of those ajimbo things.  they sell them in packs of gum over at kelso's.  let's go there and buy some.  lovato.  jonas.  both: and this is radio disney's total access.   we are at disney world, actually.  and we are singing make a wave, the song for friends for change that we did and we've recorded, and we're performing it today.  . make wave, make a wave .  make a waveis going to be in the new disney naturemovieoceans that comes out on earth day and is the theme song forfriends for change this year.  . just a pebble in the water .  it's just basically saying that if you throw a pebble in the water, you could make a wave, so do your part to make a difference.  rehearsing together is fun.  we don't really typically ever really have a routine.  he likes to do some crazy dance moves sometimes like this.  tsst tsst tsst. we might even do the crossover.  tsst tsst tsst. i might even do this one.   i don't know what's going on.  it's nice to be able to just laugh about things, like, while we're onstage and just have a good time.  we're best friends, so we have a good time with it.  we read each other's minds.  yeah.  and so sometimes i can see his future whenever we sing together.  i see her past.  that's pretty much how we connect when we perform together.   yeah, so let's do this.  . so throw a pebble in the ocean .  every time we see fans out there sing the words and getting excited.  it makes us excited.  and that's what gets us pumped up.   is this a singoff. is this a singoff.  before going onstage, you can be really excited, but when you're onstage and you can see the fans singing the words andthat's the best feeling in the world is just to know that people love your music that much that they memorize all the words to your song.   . just a pebble in the water .  for us, it'sit's an amazing song.  ..  to us.  and i think joe feels the same, yep.  . make a wave .  . make a wave .  and that's radio disney's total access.   did ye take the sword excalibur and mislay it in yonder cave of doom.  did ye make a blunder so terrible our beloved england.  did ye. did ye.  i didn't mean to.  it's just silence, knave, for now ye must decide your fate.  shall ye enter the cave of doom, bring back excalibur, and thereby restore your knightly honor, or shall ye just chicken out and be a loser geek.  would i get to keep the helmet.  decide.  aah.  you okay, man.  it's just this king arthur guy keeps getting scarier and scarier.  free reading time is over.  everybody take a deep breath.  exhale.  now we're all energized for our multiplication tables.  delivery for room 13.  i didn't order anything.  school board can get kind of behind on these things.  1976.  this stuff was ordered gunderson, god rest her soul, but it says room 13, so it's all yours.  let's see what we have here, shall we.  a bicentennial pencil sharpener, a chart of the presidents ending with carter, a disco fever crayon and glue set, and look, what's this.  wow, a brandnew mega 5,000 spirit of '76 kickball.  with superbounce action, perfectly balanced, aerodynamically designed.  they haven't made these babies since the '80s.  what are we waiting for.  let's play ball.  i got first dibs.  no, i got it.  look, only one kid can kick it first.  how are we going to figure out who that's going to be.  the law of the red dot is sacred.  its decision can never be broken.  yeah, yeah.  just give me the helmet.  ready. set. open.  crowd: aw.  i won. i won.  i got the red dot.  he's the worst kicker on the playground.  what a waste.  okay, gus, first kick of a brandnew ball.  make it count.  i'll try.  vince: okay, everybody, move in.   i did it.  you kicked our new ball over the fence.  oops.  like, look what your friend did now, t.j.  the first good ball we've had in years, and he goes and kicks it over the fence.  hey, it's no big deal.  he'll get it back.  well, gee, i don't know.  it looks kind of scary.  come on, gus.  it's no big deal.  that's what they want you to believe.  what are you talking about, butch.  that's no regular yard.  hundreds of balls have been kicked into it maybe thousands kickbaotballs, even a crazy ball or two.  but not one of them has ever been seen again.  that's why they call it the yard of no return.  yard of no return.  oh, come on.  what a bunch of hooey.  that's what little jimmy crackmer thought, too.  kids: little jimmy crackmer.  it all happened a long, long time ago.  it was the big game of '94.  jimmy was up to kick.  now, normally, jimmy wasn't much of a kicker, but this day was different.  jimmy kicked that ball hard, and he kicked it right over the fence.  ..  don't do it, jimmy.  but he didn't listen, and they never saw little jimmy crackmer again.  some kids think he was sucked into another dimension.  others say he was captured by the flesheating alien who lives there.  me i don't even want to think about it.  good job, gus.  yeah, kicking our ball into the yard of no return.  now it's lost forever.  and so the lost city of atlantis was lost forever, although we're at a loss as to why.  another ocean legend is the story of amelia earhart, who was lost over the pacific, which was quite a loss to aviation, for she was lost, lost, lost.  no return.  can i borrow a pencil, gus.  ilostmine.  hey, maybe gus kicked it over the fence, too.  see you later, ball loser.  yeah, you'd lose your head if it wasn't attached to a loser.  don't listen to them.  it was an accident.  it could have happened to anybody.  but stuff like this always happens to me.  not always, gus usually, but not always.  i might as well face it.  for the rest of my life, i'm going to be known as the kid who lost the best ball we ever had.  i'm nothing but a waste of skin.  see you later, guys.  i'm going home, if i don't getlost on the way.  oops. ha ha ha.  went the wrong way.  boy:ball loser.  girl: you'd lose your head if it wasn't attached to a loser.  butch: the yard of no return.   no return, no return.  angela garcia, valedictorian.  thomas germaine, class president.  gus griswald, ball loser.   griswald, you're interested in our bank teller position.  well, everything looks in order. wait.  it says here you lost a ball back in fourth grade.  next.  oh, yes, mr. griswald, is it.  well, you've been a good person.  there's no big sins.  there's just

the good ball only.  anything you want to say before you go.  don't let me do it.  i'm too young to die.  come on, man.  get ahold of yourself.  okay, okay, you guys are right.  i'm  going over the top.  good luck,mon ami.  there goes one brave kid.  he has to be brave to wear that ensemble.  okay, i'm just going to let myself over real slowly and aah.  t.j.: gus, are you okay, man.  i'm fine.  can you see anything.  i'm in a strange world.  things are different here different, but aah.  gus. gus.  it's okay.  i'm all right.  it's some weird statue.  it could be a man or something else something not human at all.  i'm going on.   this place gets weirder and weirder.  who lives here.  i pray i never find out.  any sign of the ball, gus.  none yet. no, wait a minute.  i think i see it.  yes, i do.  there it is the ball.  all: yay.  i am going up to it.  i'm grabbing the ball.  i've got it.  i'm turning around, and i'm aah.  gus, gus, are you okay.  no, no.  please don't hurt me.  don't eat my flesh.  i'm too young to die.   gus.  pull him back.  pull him back.  quick. tie me on.  i'm going over.  don't do it.  that yard will take you, too.  we've been picking on gus for kicking our ball over the fence.  now we're the ones who lost something in the yard of no return, only this time, it's gus.  let's go get our friend.  there's no way we can all climb over that fence.  okay, then, to the front door.   it's the flesheating alien. aah.  hello, children.  may i help you.  but you're not a flesheating alien.  no, just a harmless old lady.  name's dottie dottie deeter.

morsels, and look.  the ball.  but what about the yard of no return.  yard of no return.  ha ha ha ha.  oh, you kids slay me.  ha ha ha ha.  we owe you an apology.  we thought you were a flesheating alien.  you got your ball back, right.  it would have been easier if you had just come to the front door and asked for it.  cookies.  by the way, you kids want the rest.  more cookies.  no, i couldn't possibly.  no. i mean, balls.  i've got a million of them.  what are you talking about, dottie.  all these years, balls have been flying into my yard kickballs, footballs, even a crazy ball or two.

apollo.  well, we most certainly will, your majesty.  ..  a welcome home apollo speech.  ..  a parade.  we learned about apollo in history class.  apollo is our greatest hero.  he was my most trusted sea warrior back before you or any of your sisters were born.  the octopins who lived beyond the sargasso sea wanted to drive the merpeople from atlantica.  you're not from the sea.  the octopins wanted our space, our crops, our culture.  watch out.  swim for your lives.  they had somehow acquired a trident as powerful as mine.  apollo was wise.  he hid among the sargasso weeds overhead, awaiting his chance.  the battle was won, and apollo became a hero.  i can't wait to hail him.  hail apollo. hail apollo.  why did apollo go away, daddy.  to explore the seven seas.  an explorer.  ah. and i thought he was only a hero.   hail apollo. hail apollo.  hail apollo. hail apollo.  hail apollo.  hail apollo.  hail apollo, hail apollo.  hail apollo.  well, well, well.  apollo's back.  boy,

bravest of the brave.  yes, your majesty.  hardly a tide goes by that i'm not reminded of it.  and so you should be.  tomorrow there will be a banquet, and then we're dedicating a statue of you in the
