 maybe, but a visit to the danderson center this saturday would provide real, live historical data.  while that's true, i believe we could easily extrapolate most of that data from books and other secondary sources without having to miss the seor fusion fest on saturday.  oh.   how many times .  oh, please think it over.  these old people have experienced the most amazing things in their lifetimes.  the fusion fest is gonna be one of the most amazing experiences inmylifetime.  all right, that does it.  no more mr. mike guy.  sitting in my rocking chair, looking to the door, i dream of someone standing there.  i couldn't ask for more.  though now i'm old and getting round can sometimes cause a fuss, i know i'd like to have a friend, maybe one namedgus.  gee, i sort of know how they feel.  okay, when do we leave.  can you two imagineyour grandparents, all alone, waiting for some youthful cheer.  don't go there.  now imagine their sad faces when they hear you're not coming.   grammy and papa sad.  oh, man.  okay, mikey, count me in.  thanks, spinelli, not just from me, but from all those dear, sweet, older people who will be overjoyed to see thethreeof us.  make it four.  hola, amigos.  i come to you now with a majority.  .  come on, guys, the seor fusion fest is a onceinalifetime happening.  is this fictional favorite of yours really more important than living, breathing people.  quit asking me hard questions, mikey.  sorry to interrupt, but according to my calculations, we could fit in time for both on the same day.  oh, joy.  i'll give it half an hour.  we get in, we get out.  nobody gets bored.  here we are, about to begin the greatest saturday ever.  i can't wait to see the smiles on their faces when they see us.  go away.  we don't want any.  well, we tried.  let's hit the fusion fest.  wait, friends, i'm sure it was just some misunderstanding.  .  please, ma'am, i'm mikey blumberg.  my friends and i are here for a visit.  oh, young'uns.  well, why didn't you say so before.  i thought you were another salesman.  come in, come in.  we're gonna have a wonderful time.  speaking of time gus, initiate stopwatch.  stopwatch initiated 30 minutes and counting, teej.  let's do it.  look who's here, everybody the kid who's supposed to sing for us and his little friends.  look at those cheeks.  come here, young fella.  hey, i saw him first.  see how happy they are to have us here.  come on, boyo, we got a karaoke machine and everything.  have fun, guys.  i'm sureiwill.  come on, girlie, you're with me.  so, what do we do now.  i don't know mingle.  morning.  hi, there.  i'm t.j.  i bet you are.  i heard a bunch of you youngsters were coming.  you know what's wrong with your generation.  ..  no direction.  that's right kids today are plain unfocused.  all of you could really use a uniting cause, like our generation had in world war ii.  ..  and you look familiar.  no, i don't.  there's something about your face.   my my face.  hello, sir, i'm gretchen grundler.  oh, honey, there's no use chatting it up with norris.  he hasn't said a peep in years.  perhaps he's shy.  how about this weather we've been having.  perhaps you'd like to point out how tough things were when you were my age.  uh, streak, it's your move.  yammer all you want, kid.  nobody ruins the streak's rhythm.  in through the front door, once around the back, peek through the window, and out jumps jack.  keep it up, and off jumps spinelli.   . the camptown ladies sing this song .  .. .  squaresville, kid.  give us a break.  where did we put that hook we used during the talent show.  . i'm gwine to run .. .  boo.  boo.  boo.  boo.  . somebody bet on the .  testing one, two.  testing.  microphone ain't the problem, sonny, it's you.  you stink.  that certainly is a nice sweater you have on.  i'm running out of topics.  perhaps you'd care to discuss the physics of subatomic particles.  now that i'm declassified, i'd be delighted.  i happen to have been a prime mover on the manhattan project.  you helped develop the weapon that ended world war ii.  but surely everyone here would love to hear your stories.  most people here aren't stimulating enough to waste the diffusion of carbon dioxide, but you seem possessed of a mind.  oh, my.  well, thank you.  okay, you've seen me before.  just don't hurt me.  relax, little buddy.  i wouldn't hurt you.  you see, i know what it's like to be a little guy.  lookit.  hey, that looks like me.  sothat'swhere i saw you.  it was my mirror, 75 years ago.  but you're so big now.  is your daddy big and strong.  " chances are, you'll grow up to be just like him.  you think so.  hey, streak, is there a basketball hoop around this joint somewhere.  this domino game moves too slow.  it's all about concentration, which is what you got to have when you're at bat, facing satchel paige in the show.  . you used to play .  used to bat cleanup, back when birmingham had a team.  .  they had some of the greatest players of all time.  who you tellin'.  i played with all of them.  now, take that willie mays ..  this knitting stuff is for sissies.  mind if i flip on the tube so i can catch the wrestling.  go ahead, if you like watching weaklings in tights, but them wimps don't know nothin' about real fightin'.  .  just the lining.  only reason i knit is to keep my wrists and forearms strong.  never know when some vacuum salesman won't take no for an answer.  you got to be kiddin' me.  merchant marines never kid.  you were a merchant marine.  for 34 years.  boy, those were the days, back when you could give a dirty doublecrosser the old onetwo.  and that's why there's nothing worth listening to on the radio these days.  detention with finster might be more fun than this.  i remember wheniwas ..back in the war.  there were these two crazy old officers that were always cracking down on us.   rogan...  you wouldn't have any idea what happened to the secret communiqu i received today, would you.  why, no, commandant pricklydon, not at all.  have you asked the sergeant.  von finstrom.   sir, i haven't seen it.  in fact, i haven't seen a thing.   rogan.  rogan, that's way cooler than anything i would've heard at the seor fusion fest.  seor fusion fest.  oh, well, he's a superhero you probably never heard of.  the name sort of rings a bell.  this him.  wait a minute.  you're leapin' larry rogan, .   well, back in the day, we called him seor electricity.  come on, t.j., hurry up.  it's time to catch the bus.  let's go.  thank goodness that's over.  let's get out of here.  but, mikey, this rogan guy invented seor fusion.  that's nothing.  my guy worked at los alamos.  he actually had access to test sites.  well, my lady's teaching me a thing or two about dealing with southpaws.  come on, guys, the bus is here.  we don't want to miss the fest.  but the streak was just about to give me baserunning tips.  i'm not goin' nowhere.  we're going back in.  i won't go back in there.  i can't deal with those crazy old folks anymore.  sure you can, mikey.  they're not crazy.  they're great.  they're booing me.  huh.  i expected everyone to be happy just listening to me sing.  instead, all they do is complain about the songs i'm singing.  did you ask them what songsthey'dlike to hear.  uh, no.  maybe if you listen to what they're saying, you'll learn some neat stuff and make a few friends.  gee, i guess i wasn't thinking about it like that, t.j.  up for giving it another shot.  why, yes, i think i am.  hello again, ladies.  well, looky here.  big boy's back.  i'll now be taking requests.  now, that's more like it.  you were singing stuff my mother listened to.  how about raoul and the gang, or maybe johnny velvet.  oh, yeah, that cat really swings.  here, boyo, try this one.   .qu simptico.  . means i think you're fine .  ohh.  ohh.  ohh.  ohh.  .qu simptico.  . because you're divine .  . let me tell you, now .  . sometimes i just have to shout,"qu simptico".  . let my feelings ride out, qu simptico.  . you are, without a doubt, qu simptico.  . i'm so glad you're mine .  .   happy saturday, everybody.  .  i'm open. i'm open.  .  hit me.  ooh.  ooh.  whaa. don't hit me.  i'll take that.  and i'll take it back.  i don't think so.  two more points.  whoohoo.  out of time.  and so ends 22 1/2 minutes of "5 on vince" basketball.  good game, guys.  i'm practically sweating.  you're just saying that.  au contraire he's glistening.  this was a great idea, teej.  what could be more fun than roundball with your friends.  especially when we're ditching a statemandated scalpcare lecture.  which, by the way, we should really be getting back to.  adult head lice, pediculus humanae, are small, flatbodied, wingless insects.  these nasty little buggers are known as parasites, which means they grow and feed off of another animal.  don't let that animal be you.  in summary, head lice infect over 12 million ..  guys, looks like we made it.  aaah.  what's the big idea, .  detweiler and his pals.  it appears as though you slipped out on principal prickly's lecture.  i'll need to arrange a makeup lecture for you after school.  are you psychologically imbalanced.  you've got no right to keep us after school.  you rapscallions will report for the makeup lecture just as he says, and i appoint young menlo here to personally proctor your lesson.  always happy to serve.  to prevent lice from spreading and laying their eggs, called nits, avoid sharing personal items such as hats, coats, brushes, combs.  remember, the scalp you save  may be your own.  all right, lecture's over.  blasted health department, eating into my golf time.  and that concludes our lesson.  sheesh. about time.  maybe if we hurry we could still make kelso's for an icecracklingcold soda.  sounds good.  i'm there.  ahahah, gentlepeople, not so fast.  i've been asked to administer a scalpcare quiz.  unbelievable.  .  man, this all whomps.   question one "nit" spell and define.  menlahahah.  i can't believe it.  menlo dweebed us again.  come on, spinelli, he's just a kid doing his job.  i'm afraid i have to agree with spinelli, t.j.  dealing with menlo can be a very dispiriting experience.  no kidding.  i just remembered something.  my mom said she could drive us to commander blaine's cartoon callout on saturday.  nothing shakes off the fourthgrade blues better than screaming for your favorite cartoon.  and with all of us working as a team, we'll be controlling the cartoons all day.  blaine will be at our mercy.  let's practice.  give me a "fusion".  together: seor fusion.  give me a beanie.  together: beanie mcchimp.  i can't hear you.  together: seor fusion.  beanie mcchimp.      hey, teej, you weren't shouting.  yeah, what's with the mime act.  without you, we can hardly expect to reach the decibel level appropriate for taking command of saturday morning programming.  well, uh, heck, guys, you don't need me.  you're doing great tender, even.  besides, i can't go.  what do you mean.  surely you jest.  what's up with that.  uh, nothing, just something else i got to do.  well, got to go.  missing a commander blaine cartoon callout.  that is bizarre.  particularly considering these callouts represent a perfect marriage of t.j.'s dual loves shouting and cartoons.  something here ain't tender, and i say we find out what's what.  i just don't want to talk about it, okay.  but surely you have a sensible explanation for why you can't attend the callout.  yeah, no more bull yank.  we want the truth.  i got something important i got to do on saturday.  more important than a callout with your pals.  well, well, well, if it isn't the scalp squad.  i just got the results of your quizzes.  guess which one of you spelled " that is correct, and your scores reflect it.  i may not be able to spell "nit," but i can spell "black eye" with either fist.  i can see i've dallied here long enough.  good day.  now, where were we.  oh, yeah demanding an explanation.  um, say, anybody catch "wild world of dangerous mishaps".  tractors and tapdancing definitely do not mix.  hey, no changing the subject.  who is it.  tell us, teej.  just some boring junk.  now leave me alone.  i got to go do some homework.  skipping callouts.  doing homework.  whoisthat boy.   freedom.  another school day down.  what's the haps for this afternoon.  i'm up for heading to kelso's for something frosty.  wild finsters couldn't keep me away.  it would butter my fancy.  gretchen grundler present and accounted for.  isn't present and accounted for.  where is that bad boy anyway.  he told me he had an errand to run after school.  first he bags on us for saturday, then he's doing homework, now this.  a kid could get the feeling he doesn't like hanging with us anymore.  i'm sure whatever reason has for being unavailable to us is a good one.  hey, there's t.j. now.  here you go all wrapped up nice and special.  hope your friend likes it.  thank you, mr. k.  uh, hey, guys.  this is the errand you had to run.   yeah.  we heard it's for a friend.  yeah, it's for a friend.  oh, t.j., how thoughtful.  different friend.  oh.  if you've made a new acquaintance, i'm sure we'd be delighted to meet him.  thanks for the offer, gretch, ..no. got to go.  oh, great. t.j.'s got a secret new friend, and he's buying him stuff.  that's nothing.  20 minutes ago, i saw him trying suits on at the mall.  . oh, my.  our little t.j.'s getting married.  i think he's running for mayor.  .  i don't know.  i just don't know.  whatever's going on, t.j.'s new pal must really be something special if he wants to hang out with him more than us.  i just wish i knew who he was.  or she.  whoever it is, they're taking our freckleberry friend away from us.  and i say, callout or no callout, we got to find out what's what and who's who.  but how.  we do it like any gumshoe would.  first thing saturday morning, we put a tail on that boy.  you're gonna follow him.  oh, boy. moist.  you stay away.   there he goes.  let's follow him.  remember, maintain shadow distance.   t.j. taught us that.  where are we.  all the houses they're the same.  not a single blade of grass or leaf out of place.  what manner of child would live in a place like this.  that's what we're here to find out.   he's whistling.  such a joyful boyhood tune.  intriguing.  here comes the moment of truth.  mikey, you're crushing my hand.  sorry.    hello, menlo.  happy birthday.  howdy, t.j.  you're just in time for punch, but don't overdo it.  my uncle added fluoride.  swell.  some friend.  .  who knew menlo had birthdays.  or that he was a sheriff.  throwing us over for menlo.  children, we are through the looking glass.        do that to himself.  why would he do that tous.  menlo's caused us nothing but trouble from day one, and now teej is giving him a present.  some friend, indeed.  guys, here he comes.  oh  what are you guys doing here.  better question what areyoudoing here.  aren't you missing the cartoon callout.  we came to callyouout instead.  go, vince.  so menlo is your new friend, huh.  we thoughtwe were your friends.  guys, guys, wait a second.  i can explain.  . t.j..  i'm glad i caught you.  you left without your party favor.  i think you'll really enjoy it.  remember this.  .  that was back at my fourth birthday party.  you two ..pals.  hard to believe, isn't it.  and i were quite inseparable.  you might say we were the best of friends.  if i wasn't looking at a picture, i would not believe it.  yes, what happened.  we got older.  our interests diverged.  was such a large part of my life, it seemed a shame that nothing would remain to remind me of our friendship.  sensed how i felt, so he made a promise that every year he would come to my birthday party.  even if you're constantly dweebing him.  your words, not mine.  and despite how we've changed, he's been true to his word.  a promise is a promise.  but you guys don't even hang out anymore.  and that's okay, gus.  we'll always have the memories ..  because of t.j.  well, forgive me, but i still have guests.  catch you later.  not if i catch you first.  wow, keeping a crummy promise after all these years teej, you really are some friend.  i can't believe we doubted you.  i didn't.  me neither.  what you talkin' about, gretch.  the cartoon callout isn't over yet.  if we hurry, we can still get to see our favorites.  give me a "fusion".  together: seor fusion.  give me a beanie.  together: beanie mcchimp.  tie 'em together, better than ever.  together: seor fusion, beanie mcchimp.   captions paid for by abc cable networks group what about this one.  makes a seaweed bowl or a soap dish, or aa party hat.  that will hardly
