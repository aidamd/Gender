 i didn't know the state fair was such a big deal.  with my family moving around, i never had a chance to go to any state fair.  never.  nope.  i thought about it plenty of times.  the rides, the exhibits, the cotton candy they all seemed like a dream to me, a dream that would never come true.  that is so sad.  but today that's all going to change.  i'm finally going to the great state fair with you guys.  this is going to be the best day ever.  board the bus in an orderly and harmonic fashion, and please have your signed permission slips ready.  ah, the "get out of class free" card.  this is one note from school i'm happy to have my parents sign.  oh, no. oh, no.  don't tell me you forgot your permission slip.  i had it this morning.  my dad signed it at breakfast, and he must've put it in his pocket by mistake.  your father could bring it from his office.  he's not at the office.  he's out with the whole division having war games, and mom's out looking at drapes.  not to worry, gus.  miss grotke will understand.  thank you, phil.  watch your step, judy.  miss grotke, we got a problem.  gus forgot his permission slip.  without a permission slip, gus, you can't go.  it's school policy.   miss grotke, going on this trip means a lot to gus.  how's about you reconsider with a little help from my good friends abraham and george.  t.j. detweiler.  yes, ma'am.  that was wrong.  what's this i hear.  griswald's staying behind.  afraid so.  no problem.  i've planned some funtastic activities for both of today's staybehinds.  bothof us.  hey ya, griswald.  gellman.  you're staying behind, too.  t.j., can't you do something.  gus, i promise somehow, some way, iwillget you to that fair.  quickly, children, take your seats, or we'll miss rubbery earl the rodeo clown.   all right, you leftbehinds, it's fun time.   activity one a riproaring game of old nostalgia.  griswald, you first.  roll the die.  ohh.  three. move it, buster.  "this goldenthroated crooner really made the dames swoon with his bigband ballad, '" uh, nebraska.  eddie marengo.  haven't you heard of eddie marengo.  um, is that my next question.  oh, never mind.  your turn, gellman.  thirsty.  you children always wanting nourishment.  so i guess your dad forgot your permission slip, too.  my old man don't believe in fairs.  he says they're fixed.  there's nothing in the universe more wholesome than a fair.  they got homemade jelly and blue ribbons and everything.  except they don't got you, do they, short fry.  gellman's right, griswald.  you're not going anywhere.  none of us is, so get over it and start having fun.      a pumpkin in the shape of a very large carrot.  shazow.  hey, teej, how come you're not amazed by the amazing carrotshaped pumpkin.  reminds me of gus and how amazed he would have been.  , i know how you feel, but we're an awful long way from school.  it would be difficult for us to help gus.  well, i got to try.  i promised my friend gus, and somehow i'm going to get that permission slip.  how, teej.  i don't know, but i better work fast.  there's no telling what torture finster's putting gus through.   . ahoy there, sailor, .  . first you take your right flipper .  . and you slap it on your pants .  . next, you take your left flipper .  . and you catch a little fish .  . then you take your little tail .  . and you swish, swish, swish .   gellman, it's time to do the otter dance.  my old man don't believe in otters.  actually, i wouldn't mind not dancing, either.  nonsense, griswald.  childrenlovethe otter dance.  now cheer up and dance.   . ahoy there, sailor, .  . first you take .. .  this is lieutenant griswald.  i'm not in right now.  i'll be back as soon as i've destroyed the enemy.  it was worth a try.  gus' father can't be reached at the office.  communicating with him directly while he's on maneuvers would seem impossible.  the army uses pigeons to carry messages.  i read about it inseor fusion285, "the time warp " j just a sec, gretch.  "lieutenant griswald.  " exclamation point.  exclamation point.  there.  i know, gretch.  it's a crazy idea, but it just might work.  actually, what i've been trying to tell you is that it wasn't a pigeon.  it was a dove.  a dove.  what kind of person would leave a dove out.  getting late, ain't it.  told you them socalled friends of yours wasn't coming.  sure they're coming at least i think.  you been thinking too much, little squiddy.  i could think about going to the fair, too, but it ain't going to happen, so what's the point.  you'd want to go to the fair if you could.  yeah, sure.  what. hey.  griswald, will you stop yapping about the fair.  it's bad enough i don't get to go without you reminding me.  miss finster.  are you saying you like the fair, too.  of course i do.  everybody likes the fair, but i gave up on going long ago 'cause every year i'm stuck looking after you leftbehinds.  you don't hear me complaining, so get over it and finish your liverwurst sculpture of calvin coolidge.  it's fun.  , it's nice you're trying to help gus.  your many plans have been imaginative, indeed.  making a run for the interstate in that bumper car was bold.  , these ideas of yours, while imaginative, are also completely ridiculous.  face the facts.  there's nothing we can do.  sorry, guys.  i wasn't thinking.  we are at the fair, and because of me, no one's having any fun.  you guys go enjoy yourselves.  what about you.  i promised gus i'd get him to the fair, and i willnotenjoy myself until i do.  i know just the guy who can help me.  look at this.  an antique telegraph.  maybe we could use it.  i bet that thing hasn't been used in over 100 years.  come on, it's gus we're talking about.  we got to do something.  to contact an officer in the field using a telegraph, you'd have to construct a radio amplifier, uplink the signals to a communications satellite, and hope that somehow the message was received and relayed to the proper coordinates.  okay, i'll need some wire lots of it and i'll need foil and something with a crank.  here we go again.   well, here goes nothing.    americanski boy being left behind from fair.  nyet.   urgent message from washington, sir.  habberswam was truly perplexed.

on the four food groups, starting with a 6week focus on grains.   and to kick off our cereal studies, we'll be watching a video.  all right.  tv in school.  what a way to learn.  you know what it means when miss grotke shows a video.  we get a visit from the a.v. kid.    i got a req for a 27inch and a 4head toploader.  please sign here, here, and here.  why, certainly, brock.  thank you.  my pleasure, ma'am.  did you see his keys.  there must've been a gazillion.  actually, i calculate far fewer than a gazillion, but more than enough to open every room in the buildingtwice.  now then, class, let me just plug in this vcr and  goodness. brock forgot to leave an extension cord.  i'd be honored to get one from him.  i'd help.  for one cord.  um, i hear they're heavy.  well, all right, ..  hall passes.  i'm going to be the first fourth grader ever to see inside the a.v. kid room.  not if i beat you to it.  we'll just see about well, well, well.  if it isn't detweiler and lasalle.  out of class without hall passes, i see.  no, you don't understand.  cry me a river, you truant hooligans.  to the principal's office.  march.  the boys are with me.  you are familiar with this.  since you have that laminated allaccess hall pass, brock, and since youvouch for them i'll let you two go, but don't let it happen again.  gee, thanks a lot, a.v. kid.  if you hadn't come along shh. class in session.  follow me.  whoa.  huh.  half a door.  that is so cool.  you don't get off the playground much, do you.  here's what you came for.  a grounded 3prong 15footer in safety orange.  whoa.  first the hall pass, then the trick with the door, and now this.  kid, your job's amazing.  ..  and i'm going to miss it.  so then he says, "yeah, and i'm going " and then he closes the rest of the door.  he's a most curious and enigmatic sixth grader.  is it true he never goes to class.  some say yes, some say no.  nobody's had much contact with him since third grade.  third grade is when he was chosen.  tradition says you can't be kid until fourth grade, but for brock they made an exception.  he sure is going to be hard to replace.  what.  his folks are moving to portugal, and he has to turn in his keys.  that's what he meant " anyone interested in applying for the job should report to the lunchroom immediately.  see you.  later.  where are those guys going.  i'm guessing to see a kid about some keys.  this is going to be great.  vince lasalle, a.v. kid.  more like vince lasalle, detweiler, a.v. kid.   gee, how many kids did menlo tell.  well, may the best k win.  thank you.  i
