 t not fair.  and we don't.  because the young inventor's fair is an invitational exposition.  it's a great opportunity to show off exciting new ideas from smart young minds.  so why's spinelli going with you.  she needed a smart kid to be her assistant.  want to make something of it.  nnot at all.  may i be the first to wish you success on this and all future scientific endeavors.  come, gretchen, our colleagues await.  girls they sure stick together.  hey, everybody.  that mikey kid's going for it again.  again.  if he pulls it off, he could get in the world record book.  let's motor.  ooh.  looks like he's going to do it this time.  he's going to blow the biggest bubble ever.  crowd: blow. blow.  blow. blow. blow.  gentlemen, we're witnessing history in the making.  gus, alert the media.  crowd: blow. blow.  ooh, bubble.  how it feels.  crowd: blow. blow. blow.  blow. blow. blow.  blow. blow. blow.   blow. blow. blow.  blow. blow.  : no.  bubble go boom.  meddling kid.   ..head.  boy: his whole head is covered with gum.   i tried to alert the media , but the best i could do was this guy from the school paper.  this story pretty much tells itself.  it's one i've heard too many times.  i need a juice.  no. this can't be happening.  you'll break the bubble gum record next time.  you don't understand.  there won't be a next time.  there wasn't even supposed to be a this time.  i'm not allowed to chew gum because when i do, i do this.  when my mom and dad find out that i got gum in my hair again, i'm going to be grounded for a whole year.  what about using ice on your hair.  tried it before.  it froze my brain.  cooking oil.  urban myth.  putting a bag over your head no, wait.  that's for hiccups.  i'm doomed.  calm down, big guy.  we can fix it so your mom and dad never know.  all you do is get a haircut.  but i spent all my money on gum.  i don't have enough left to go to a barber.  you don't need a barber.  you got one right here.  snippetysnip.  problem solved.  uh, teej, can i talk to you.  no offense, man, but are you wack.  what do you know about cutting hair.  neno do it a million times.  you comb, cut, watch out for the ears.  so, mikey, up for the haircut.  i don't know.  trust me.  you're not going to hurt me, are you.  couldn't if i tried.  these are safety scissors.  now then, you just pull the hair straight up and cut.  hey, that didn't hurt.  told you i know what i'm doing.  now quit rocking the duck.  what do you think, guys.  no, i think it's a little long on the left, like he's leaning to one side.  good eye, vince.  well, that's it.  you know, i'm not halfbad at this haircutting thing.  in fact, neno, i'd be packing up my clippers and comb juice and hitting the road.  there's a new barber in town, and his name is mr. teej.  mikey: so it looks good, right.  see for yourself.  gus, the mirror, please.  you sure you're done.  show the man.  could you step back a little, gus.  ..  aah.  was that a good "aah" or a bad one.  you ruined my hair.  you're awfully close to hurting mr. teej's feelings.  your feelings.  what about my head.  come on, mikey.  you're styling. right, fellas.  it's what. radical.  yeah, right.  it's, uh, very cutting edge.  if i had enough hair, i'd probably get one, too.  trust me, mikey.  everyone's going to love it.   i'm telling.  not so fast.  first, tell mikey what a good haircut he's got.  are you kidding.  you tell mikey his haircut looks cool, and i'll give you my seor fusion #8.  #8, huh.  i need that one for my collection.  okay. why not.  whoa, mikey, that's a great new look for you.  you think.  sure. you look way cool.  in fact, i heard those guys in the band dogs pajamas just got their hair cut the same way.  did someone say dogs pajamas.  they're only our favorite alternahop swing band ever.  gave me a haircut to look just like them.  both: two, please.  gentlemen, grab a duck.  both: you look just like them.  let's show off and tell people.  you cover the west playground, and i'll take the east.  guys, i think i found my calling.  whoa.  did it just like dogs pajamas.  what's he charging for one of those puppies.  sam and me just gave a couple of comic books.  i'm there.  normally, it's three ducks, no waiting, but you can see how busy we are.  i'll pencil you in for later this afternoon, but i can't make any promises.  what if i give you my copy of seor fusion #2.  #2.  i'll see what i can do.  i think you missed a spot.  i suppose you think you can do better.  as a matter of fact, i do.  mr. vince, i presume.  call me vincenzo.  payment is due upon services rendered.  but all my good junk is in my desk.  i'll keep an eye on your sister until you get back.  hurry, bradley.  hey, teej, think about this.  we've got the ashleys at our mercy.  we could really make them look bad.  vincenzo, need i remind you that we are professionals.  we always do our best regardless of who happens to be straddling the duck.  check.  three mikeys coming up.  teej and vincenzo are completely booked.  you should have called.  but i have to go to my cousin's wedding.  i hear the huffler kid's giving his version of the mikey behind the dumpster.  why don't you go see him.  but i want the real mikey.  sorry. bye now.  i can't believe it.  we're actually turning away business.  only one problem, teej what happens when everybody figures out these haircuts whomp.  what are you talking about.  besides, the first rule of business is give people what they want, and today they want the mikey.  what if some bigger kid gets one of these haircuts, realizes they whomp, then decides to kick our butts.  what bigger kid would possibly want one of these stupid haircuts.  i'd like an appointment.  everyone would like an appointment, teej and vincenzo are booked till august.  so why don't you just go home and get your mommy to give you the bowl treatment.  oh, i think they'll find the time for me.  kking bob.  out of my way.  but you can't go back there.  you two barber boys.  oh, hello, there, king bob, your highness, sir.  what can we do for you today.  i want a haircut.  a haircut.  my mom's going to make me get one anyway, so i've decided to get one from you.  this haircut of yours, the mikey they call it, has swept the playground.  at first, i didn't like it, but my advisors assured me it was the coolest thing around.  they said i'd look like the guys from dogs pajamas, so i want the same thing, only different.  different, your majesty.  but everybody loves the mikey.  it's the latest trend.  i lead.  i do not follow.  now give me a king bob, and make it snappy.  you take this one, buddy.  i only do the mikey.  you're the stylist.  enough talk.  let the royal cutting begin, and don't screw it up.  okay, how about we do it together.  you do one side, i'll do the other.  oops.  what did you say.  looking good, your royal hairness.  mama.  okay, your majesty, ..done.  your side looks like it got caught in a blender.  i know. i was nervous.  well, mine's not much better.  nice knowing you, mr. teej.  well, what do you think, sire.  advisors.  well, out with it.  how great do i look.  it's excellent, your excellency.  a haircut fit for a king.  gnarly, my liege.  behold. i am trim.   and so it is we live.  let's get out of here while the getting's good.  get out of what.  we're in the hair business for keeps.  say, how much do you think they charge for one of those redandwhite poles.  in honor of my new haircut, i proclaim a royal procession.     he's so stylish.  it's the newest rage among the royals, but remember, we had it first.  it's so refreshing to have a king who understands fashion.  well, teej, looks like we did it.  we're rich and famous, and you wanted to run.  hey, you know the beauty part.  in four weeks when everyone needs a trim, we start all over again.   what's so funny.  who dares laugh in my presence.  you people you you you look all goofy.  ha ha.  the heck you say.  no, spinelli's right.  your hair it looks like crop circles. ha ha.  no, no, no. you're wrong.  see, we all look like that band dogs pajamas.  i just saw those guys on tv.  they got hair down to their butts. ha ha.    but they told us these haircuts were cool.  who told you.   heh heh.  both: see ya.  after them.  gee, you think we should help them.  sure, as soon as my hair grows back.   say it. say it.  what did i miss.  a kid just dropped the "g" word on spinelli.  he called her a girl.  poor guy.  say it while you still got teeth.  but youarea girl.  that does it.  huh.  that's the seventh time i've caught you scrapping this month, spinelli.  know what that means.  the other kids just aren't getting it.  it means i'm calling your parents.  big whoop.  man:for the love of mike, igor's got a foreign object.  that's no foreign object.  that's a wrench.  mrs. spinelli: oh, ashley, can you come here for a minute.  yeah, yeah, i'm coming.  i don't know, dad, but i'm beginning to think that wrestling might be fixed.  perish the thought, sweetie, but now we need to talk about the wrestling that you've been doing at school and what we're going to do about it.  i've enrolled you in dance class.  dance class.  but that's for girls.  youarea girl, honey.  besides, it's not a punishment.  it's to help you manage your extra energy. look.  see. it helped me.  dad.  nope, i'm standing behind your mother on this one, pookie.  and what if i refuse.  then, fixed or not, there will be a moratorium on wrestling shows in this house.  but, honey, "grapple mania" is right around the corner.  a moratorium.  hey, i can live without the wrestling for a while.  till you're 21.    is like this.  otherwise, hernia.  new girl is where.  come now out, little ashley, please.  the name's spinelli and i'm not coming anywhere in these loser 'tards.  if i have now to use russian army carry, i will.  you wouldn't.  with the mark and the set and the okay, okay, i'm coming.   nice boots.  the better to kick you with, bunhead.  her name's not bunhead.  it's megan, just like mine.  and mine.  you know, you bunheads remind me of someone.  we remind her of someone.  all: ludicrous.  that tears it.  the small withthetwofists type yes, are you just what i'm looking for.  for what.  we see. follow.  rest of you, work.  spinelli, you remind me of little dancer known by me in old country.  yeah.  what's she doing now.  this i tell in time, but now i'm thinking finally, might be partner for mikhail.  who's mikhail.  i show. mikhail.  yes, mademoiselle spinelli.  mikey.  ah, you are familiar.  is good.  mikhail, show her the stretches.  mikey, what are you doing here.  you hardly ever get in trouble.  oh, no, spinelli, i'm not here 'cause i got in trouble.  i'm here 'cause i want to be.  you see, dance is both my blessing and my curse.  what are you talking about.  it all started years ago.  you might not believe this, spinelli, but when i was a baby, i was sort of big for my age.  honey, i'm home.  uhoh.  daddy.  no, mikey, no.  mikey:somehow my parents got the idea i might not be graceful enough, so they enrolled me in dance class.  at first, it was great.  the trouble started when mademoiselle set me up with a partner.  aah.  you see, i had big feet.  then mademoiselle had the idea of making me official spinner.   that didn't work out too well, either.  then mademoiselle wanted to make me a featured soloist.  apparently, performing wasn't for me.  so that's where i am today.  mademoiselle says i'm a great stage manager, but just once, i'd like to get out there.  i'd show them you don't have to be skinny to soar like an eagle.  i got an idea, mikey.  i'll be your partner.  you can't hurt my feet while i'm wearing my boots, spinning fast is one of my favorite pastimes, and there's no way you can knock me down if i jump up while you're landing.  spinelli, you're the greatest.  okay, now let go.  aah.  you okay, spinelli.  that was great.  do it again.  uhh.    girls: uhh.  all of you have worked very hard, especially mikhail and spinelli, and so i have wonderful surprise.  next friday, have arranged a performance for very special audience.  these costumes are for dancing in, not for playing in.  at last, my debut.  this is so exciting.  who do you think we're dancing for.  probably a bunch of rich stiffs.  see. hard work has paid off.  i am proud like i was for that little girl in old country.  exactly.  so that's what is meant by the birds and the bees, and thank you for your thoughtprovoking question.   have a nice weekend.  oh, oh, i almost forgot.  next friday, we're all invited to a very special dance recital.  dddance recital.  it's going to be performed by the students of mademoiselle povlova's salon for independent movement.  won't that be exciting.   look at me.  i'm mademoiselle povlova.   no, no, no, i'mmademoiselle povlova.   when will that woman learn all representational dance is dead.  yeah.  dance is for nerds.  well, for your information, i take dance.  what are you talking about.  you heard me.  dance is great.  it's like poetry for the body.  in fact, i'm in madame povlova's dance class.  and you know what else.  i'm going to be in that dance recital next friday.  ..  ..  in a recital.  don'tyouhave something to say about this, spinelli.   hey, mikey, come back.  we were just kidding.  i can't do it, mikey.  i just can't do it.  yeah, i kind of figured.  i spent too much time on my tough rep to blow it all in one afternoon.  i mean, if i dance, i'd have to leave a trail of 5thgrade teeth from the jungle gym to the backstop just to make them quit laughing.  sorry, mikey.   yeah, well, it's okay.  i'm sort of used to stage managing.  i've gotten pretty good at opening and closing the curtains.  hey, mikey.  anyway, thanks for everything, mademoiselle, but i got a rep to protect, so here.  you are free to do as you wish.  i am sad i no longer live in a country where the talented can be taken from family and forced to do what they are good at.  yeah, well, sorry.  i better go.  now remember, no laughing.  yeah, mikey's our pal.  we got to stand by him.  even if he is practicing an art form of no meaning to the contemporary audience, right, spinelli.  thank you for your reception of warmth.  there is change in program.  "wings of trouble" pas de deux has been canceled.  please enjoy now rest of show.  isn't "wings of trouble" mikey's dance.  maybe they canceled it 'cause mikey can't do it right.  poor guy.  he'll be crushed.   mikey's lucky they canceled his act.  he'd have looked like an idiot.  oh, brother.  hey, where's spinelli going.  guess she couldn't take it.  break a leg out there.for .  spinelli: yo, mikey.  let'get this sw on the road, shall we.  well, at least spinelli made a clean getaway.  yeah, she's probably home "  in very exciting turning events, "wings of trouble" is back on program and will be performed for you now by mikhail and beautiful spinelli.  all:  did she just say spinelli.    whoa.    give me your autograph, spinelli.  no, me.  mikey, spinelli.  you guys rocked the western world today.  i hope that sounded as cool as it did in my head.  it sounded just great, gus.  oh, pookie, you were wonderful.  you danced like a butterfly and stung like a bee.  mom, dad, what are you guys doing here.  your instructor called us and told us to come.  but i don't get.  mademoiselle, how did you know i was going to dance.  remember little girl back in old country.  little girl was me.  i, too, had to learn that how you call it. rep.  wasn't as important as friends i loved.  uh, well, i better go get mikey and, uh, warm down.  come on, big guy.  perhaps there's hope for new country, after all.  captions by vitaccaptions paid for by abc cable networks group ) )
