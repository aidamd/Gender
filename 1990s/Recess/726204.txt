 february 17th.  undercover observations for miss finster, tape 93.  what do you think, should we dig in tunnel 32a, or maybe take a nice burrow down 14c.  i don't know.  last time, we ixnay. andallray.   so then, like, " and i go, "as if," and she's all, " ew. it's randall.  get out of here, you little snitch.  together: loser.   so i says to joey, girlie to you," and then let him have it. pow.  hey, look what i found a spy, and he's wired for sound.  hey.  scram, you little monkey booger.   what have you got for me today, randall.  well, hector geckell made himself throw up to get out of the spelling quiz.  i saw shirley benson spit on principal prickly's car.  that's it.  i expected more from you, randall.  perhaps you've lost your touch.  no.  i like you, randall, but i can't afford any dead weight in my organization.  maybe we should talk about your retirement.  please, miss finster, give me one more chance.  douglas over there shows potential.  i can do better.  i know i can.  i'll dig up some real dirt.  well, if it means that much to you, i'll give you one more chance, but this time you'd better not let me down.   let's see.  peewee roitano has webbed toes, kenny sapperstein is a bed wetter.  spinelli.  no, it can't be.  this is way too good for finster.  why, with dirt like this, rule the playground.  ha ha ha.  hey, no cuts, worm breath.  what, do you got crayons in your ears.  get to the end of the line before i show you my fist.  i wouldn't do that.  we wouldn't want everyone knowing your little secret.  get out of here, you little i know your name, spinelli, your first name.  sorry i messed up your shirt there, randall.  did i say it was a nice shirt.  nice try, but it's not going to work.  come on, randall, old buddy, don't tell anybody.  you've never done anything for me.  i'll do whatever you want.  don't tell anyone,please.  if it means that much to you, there is a thing or two you could do.  name it.  my homework for the rest of the year.  also, from now on you must refer to me as his supreme most honorable lord randall.  what.  okay. done.  which brings us to items 3 through 27.  27.  i'll get you for this, ashley spinelli.  girl: spinelli an ashley.  i don't believe it.  don't listen to him.  he's lying.  oh, yeah.  well, explain this.    no.  ashley, ashley, ashley.  why did my name have to be ashley.  it's not that bad.  would not a spinelli by any other name punch as hard.  mikey's right.  it's just a name.  ashley isn't just a name.  it's a curse.  perhaps you should have it changed.  i can't.  i was named after my greataunt ashley, the first woman to win the iditarod.  she's a family hero.  besides, it's not that i hate the name, it's just that for as long as i can remember every other girl named ashley's always been one of them snotty, prissy, and a member of their stupid club.  so.  now that everybody knows my name, i'm going to have to join their stupid club and wear makeup and play dollies and drink tea.   what's so funny.  oh, nothing.  it's just the ashleys wouldn't let you join their club if you paid them a million bucks.  yeah, the ashleys hate your guts.  aw, guys, that's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me.  what am i so worried about.  they can't do anything to me, right.  this is like a major tragedy.  that creature an ashley.  how could it be.  just look at her hair.  she doesn't even mousse.  all these years of primping and blowdrying the ashley name to perfection, and now this.  we have to do something.  like what.  i'm afraid our only choice is to make spinelli into one of us.  together: ew.  what choice do we have.  if we let her go around being her disgusting self, the name ashley will be ruined forever.  no longer will it stand for beauty and specialness.  soon other girls will be considered cooler than us, and if we're not careful, by junior high our first dates will be with guys named paul or joe.  oh.  ashleys, we have no choice.  we must make spinelli into one of us.  it's, like, the only way.  what do you want.  , , to be our new sister.  yeah, right.  send in the clowns, powder puff.  , you don't have a choice.  like, what.  according to the constitution of the playground rule 5, article 3, under "cliques" "any kid named ashley must become a member of the ashleys if invited " that can't be right.  it is.  it's an obscure rule, but it's here.  so i guess it's official you're one of us.  together: one of us.  one of us.  no, you'll never take me alive.  let me go. let me go.  let me go.  come on, ashley s.  you'll just love our clubhouse.  boy, talk about peer pressure.  this is your clubhouse.  as if.  this is our clubhouse.  it's remarkable what one can do with a few accessories.  wow. this is amazing.  ..  hey, why are you looking at me that way.  don't worry.  it's a good thing.  stop. no. no.  no, stop.  do something.  they're torturing her.  kids of the playground, we present to you .   ha ha ha.  spinelli in a dress.  oh, this is rich.  this is really rich.  ..  let me at him.  let me at him.  i think we have more work to do.  no. no.  those ashleys are inhuman.  worse. they're debs.  we got to do something, you guys.  i don't know, teej.  i've been studying the constitution.  the only way a kid can get out of a clique is if all the other kids vote them out.  if your name's ashley, you're one of them no matter what.  wait. that's it.  spinelli's not willing to change her name, right.  yeah.  ..  i got just the thing library cards, social security cards, whatever you want.  , i asked for a diet cola.  this is not diet.  i can't take it anymore.  i can't take it.  you hear me.  i am not an ashley.  i never wanted to be an ashley.  i'm no good at this stuff.  please let me go.  don't worry, ashley s.  before you know it, you'll be blowdrying and moussing just like us.   i love it when she's like this.  i'm here for the meeting.  hello. it's ashleys only.  like, duh.  exactly.  that's why i'm here.  ashley grundler.  your name's not ashley.  it is now.  i've got my social security card, my school i.d.  don't worry.  she still needs to be invited to join.  which one of us is going to do that.  perhaps ashley s.  would be so kind.  no, listen, gretchen.  ..  yeah, sure, no problem.  ahem.  , , to be our new sister.  thanks, spineli mean, ashley s.  whoa, spiffy digs.  what are you doing here.  ashley detweiler.  you're an ashley.  don't forget about us.  our names are all ashley, too.  it's official.  but you're not even girls.  hey, it's the '90s.  , invite you, ashley, ashley, ashley, and ashley into our club.  together: yay.  oops, i almost forgot.   ..  together: ashleys.  yay.  i invite you and you and you and you and you and you and you.  what are we going to do.  i know.  we'll kick them out.  it takes a unanimous vote.  and we kind of like it here.  there is one way you can get us to leave.  name it.  you let her out, and we'll go, too.  i hate it when i don't get my way.  welcome back.  thanks.  i thought i was a goner, but i should have known.  as long as a kid's got friends like you, it doesn't matter what your name is.  , where's your dolly.  i'll give you to the count of 10.  ..2...  aah.  come back here, you little worm.  there's a lot of ashleys out there, but there's only one spinelli.  in this cornerer, weighing in at 76 pounds soaking wet, the rolling wonder, the sultan of spin, trash can champion t.j. detweiler.   and in this corner, the challenger tipping the scales at 112 pounds in his socks, the big kahuna, the lovable lummox, our own mr. mikey.  hooray.  hooray.  but i don't want to do it.  i'm scared.  based on every law of physics, this is perfectly safe.  that can't be true.  it isn't.  i'm giving 30to1 odds on mikey.  you could be jingling milk money.  i'm in, man.  on your marks, ..  go.  aah.  hey.  well, well, t.j. detweiler.  what a surprise.  mikey: aah.  you just bought yourself a oneway ticket to principal prickly's office.  argh.  he's stuck tight.  you little troublemakers.  if hank the custodian ..  trash receptacles are made for trash, not for little boys to ride in.  stand back, kids.  i'll lube him up and slip him out easy as pie.   miss finster, you're hurting me.  excuse me, t.j. dear.  i didn't realize you were still here.  well, that's that.   looks like i got a jello incident in sector five.  guess i'd better get going.  someday, boy, you might grow up to be like hank a fine figure of a man.  huh.  just keep your carcass out of those barrels.  are you okay, miss finster.  shut up, you little wart.  you, there. no sharing.  eat that broccoli.  you, who told you ..  fish sticks.  i'm telling you guys, there's something weird going on between finster and hank.  what are you talking about.  every time he comes around, she suddenly turns nice.  maybe it's a grownup thing being nice to each other and mean to us.  i think it's something else.  it's it's mikey: love.  what.  what.  what.  miss finster has a crush on hank, ever since that day he fixed her drawers.  how do you come up with this stuff.  they're like romeo and juliet, troilus and cressida, arnold schwarzenegger and maria shriver.  that's crazy.  i think mikey's right.  i'm going to find out for sure.  miss finster.  yes, my child.  that is perhaps the ugliest dress i've ever seen you wear, and you've worn some pretty rank ones.  why, thank you, dear.  ..  what is it, eau delocker room.  you smell like my gym socks.  thank you for noticing, t.j.  it's so nice to be noticed.  ahh.  yep, she's a goner.  now we know why she's so nice when hank's around.  too bad he's not around allthe time.  are you thinking what i'm thinking.  i was thinking about getting more french fries.  if we could get miss finster and hank together, shewouldbe nice all the time.  yeah.  no more detention.  no more ear yanks.  we could get away with anything we wanted.  yeah.  yeah.  yeah.  we're talking about people's feelings here.  we're messing with fate.  by influencing the orbit of these two spheres of love, we could potentially change the course of history.  we'll be making miss finster happy, hank happy, and ourselves happy.  there's no downside.  the spark is there.  all we got to do is fan the flames.  the librarian said this was the most romantic music they had.  what are those.  they're called records or albums, depending on your generational affiliation.  we've got the old music and the old music player.  now all we have to do is get the old people.  f. f. f.  randall, my trusted spy, the only kid around here i can count on.  he's done so much for me.  hmm.  dminus.  f.  go.go.  what do you want.  spit it out.  there's kids running in the cafeteria.  hooligans.  hank, there's a big emergency in the lunchroom.  one of the milk dispensers blew.  i told them not to install those newfangled x17s.  they've never been cafeteriatested.  when i get ..  hey.  what's going on here.  it's not natural to store so much milk.  hey. hey.  you little brats.  why, when i get ..  what's wrong with this door.  hank.  miss finster.  what are you doing here.  well, there was some sort of problem, but now i really don't remember what it was.  hee hee hee.   do you hear music.  whenever i look at you.  you are some kind of woman, miss finster.  please, call me muriel.  ha ha ha.  oh ho ho.  ha ha ha.  oh, hank, i've never been so happy.  man, isn't this great.  with miss finster gone, we're free.  ha ha ha.  ha ha ha.  we got to go see the king.  ..  where's king bob.  big

trusted spy.  aplus.  she looks so happy, doesn't she.  yeah. come on.  let's go destroy her life.  a. a.   a.  uh, miss finster, could we talk to you.  certainly, t.j. dear.  what can i do for you and your lovely friends.  she creeps me out when she talks like that.  well, i don't really know how to put this, miss finster, but we miss you.  i haven't gone anywhere.  notthisyou, the old you.  ..  ..  and disciplined us.  oh, you kids and your childlike exaggerations.  walk with us.  since you and hank got together, the place is a mess.  a dark cloud has blown over the monkey bars.  oh, ho ho ho.  dark clouds.  oh, why, that's nonsense.  it's a beautiful day.  the sun is shining, the birds are singing, ..   has gone to pot.  aah.  hank, i need to talk to you.  there's something i want to say, too.  i don't know how to put this.  both: it's over.  we don't have any choice, muriel.  we have a calling, and that calling is this.  dirt is our calling.  no, not dirt.  the playground, muriel, the school, the halls, the grass, the windows, the flagpole.  the kids they're your calling, muriel.  without my gentle guidance, they're lost.  they need me, hank.  and the school needs me, muriel.  i walked into the boys' bathroom.  do you know what i found.  no paper towels in the dispensers, no toilet paper in the stalls, no sanicovers on the seats.  whose fault was that.  mine, muriel.  you're right, hank.  if we don't end this now, we'll regret it.  maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of our lives.  will i ever see you again, hank.  of course you will, muriel.  wherever there's a hall that needs mopping, i'll be there.  wherever there's a urinal mint that needs replacing, wherever a kid has barfed on the floor, all you got to do is beep me.  you know how to beep me, don't you.  push the phone buttons and hit pound.  goodbye, hank.  i'll miss you.  and i you, muriel, and i you.  o cruel fates, must you play so hard on these hearts of flesh.  miss finster, i found this.  he used to dust the radiator with it.  thank you, t.j.  oh, and miss finster, are those your shoes, or did you mug a clown on your way to school.  why, you little
