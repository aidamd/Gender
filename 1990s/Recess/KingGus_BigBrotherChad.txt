what you did, he's going to get you good.  ooh, i'm quivering in my hightops.  yay.  yay.  okay, that's enough.  you're welcome. you're welcome.  did you see that.  wow, that was the coolest thing i've ever seen.  that was nothing.  vince, you just faced down chucko, the meanest fifth grader on the playground.  if that's not cool, i don't know what is.  vince is so cool, every kid on the playground wants to hang with him.  that's ridiculous.  vince, want to hang with us.  vince is so cool, kids of every grade worship him like a god.  where do you guys get this stuff.  almighty vince, we offer to you our 2 front teeth, worth 50 cents street value.  face it, vince, there's nobody cooler than you.  what about chad.  oh, yeah. chad.  who's chad.  my big brother the coolest guy this school has known.  once when i was in kindergarten, i was alone in the sandbox.  chad played with me.  back in first grade when i got that bean stuck up my nose, chad showed me how to blow it out.  chad was cool.  i haven't seen him for years.  my big brother chad's going to pick me up after school today.  really.  if you play your cards right, you just might get a chance to see him again.  vince's big brother chad is coming by after school.  he gave me my first shovel.  let's dig him a really big hole.   guess what i just heard.  chad is coming after school.  i remember him from when i was in first grade.  what a hunk.  he had those dreamy permanent teeth.  i remember once when i was a mere fourth grader, chad actually spoke to me.  it was at that moment i knew that one day i, bob, would be king.    vince: i wonder why all these kids are here.  must be some sort of celebrity.  vince, what's chad up to now.  you're all here to see chad.  you think he'd sign my shovel.  is he still cute.  we haven't seen him, like, forever.  uh, he's the same.  he just got a cool bike.  chad got a new bike.  probably a mountain bike.  hey, everybody, chad's riding a chopper.  there he is now.  hey, chad.   chad.  nice hog.  hog. no, not him.  him.  vinny, i'm going to be late for chess club.  coming, chad.  see you later, guys.  i got to go hang with my cool big brother chad.   that's chad.  he seemed so much bigger before.  and so much cooler, too.  why, he's nothing but a nerd.  i'm so depressed.  gretchen: actually, when you think about it, it all makes sense.  what selfrespecting fifth grader would hang out with us when we were in kindergarten.  he seemed like theuberchad ..  he's a total dork.  poor vince.  he doesn't even know.  think how he's going to take it when he finds out.  ha ha ha.  chad a geek.  that's rich.  that's really rich.  take it from someone who knows, your brother is definitely a geek.  he can burp the whole alphabet.  what's the thing your brother wears in his pocket.  pocket protector.  he doesn't want to get ink on his shirt.  what's that stuff he wraps around his glasses.  tape.  they break all the time.  that's a classic sign.  you'd break your glasses if you had baseballs flying at you.  chad's on the baseball team.  he's the greatest scorekeeper they ever had.  i rest my case.  my big brother chad is not a geek.  i'll see you later.  i got to pick up chad's turtle from the vet.  stage one denial.  spinelli: what's that stuff he wraps around his glasses.  vince:tape.  gretchen: that's a classic sign.  gretchen:take it from someone who knows, your brother is definitely a geek.  ..  man, biology class was really neat.  we're studying the life cycle of the colombian tree toad.  someday i'd like to live among them and learn their peaceful ways.  geek. geek.  after chess club, the guys and i went to compuhut and watched them unpack the mouse pads. they're neato.  geek.  geek.  geek.  whoopseedaisy.  geek. geek.  geek. geek.  it's true.  it's true.  is it something i said.  oh, brother.  chad: enter, if you dare.  hey, vince, check it out.  i just beat myself at 3dimensional chess.  can we talk.  sure.  i don't know how to say this, but i've been noticingthat you're a geek.  yeah, so.  you know.  ever since first grade.  i brought my pet earthworm to showandtell and everybody laughed.  i thought you were cool.  you have all these cds.  geek music sondheim, gilbert and sullivan.  you always did cool stuff.  you always knew everything.  sorry, vince, but i am what i am, and i'm a geek.   here comes ferdie's message.  we started our own chat room. neato, huh.  ..  vince, it's not the end of the world.  chad's a geek.  big deal.  he's still your brother.  ..  all these years, i thought chad was so cool.  now that i know he's not, it makes me question everything.  heck, if he's a geek, maybe i'm a geek.  maybe my whole life's a sham.  come on, vince, you're talking crazy.  am i.  i can see it all now.  it will start small.  one of these days i'll be walking along, and something will catch my eye.  ooh.  soon i'll be having strange cravings for polyester pants and orthopedic shoes, saying words like whoopseedaisy and neato.  before you know it, i'll be playing cauldrons & caverns, learning stupid yoyo tricks, and sneaking into scifi conventions in my spare time.  and then one night ..    neato.  come on, that's not the way things are going to be.  maybe, and maybe not, but if this geek thing's hereditary, i'm a walking time bomb.  man, things can't get any worse than this.  that's the kid, cy, the guy who thinks he's so cool.  you've been giving my little brother a hard time, eh.  i think this is just a big misunderstanding.  yeah, you misunderstanding that you do not mess with the kowalski family, ever.  hey.  leave those kids alone.  i can only hold him back so long.  it's okay, vince.  stay out of this, geekoid.  you heard me, cy.  leave those kids alone.  and if i don't.  if you don't, you can just forget about me helping you with your math homework anymore.  bbut we're starting algebra soon.  don't take that.  he's a geek.  shut up, chucko.  this guy's not kidding.  look, chad, we're sorry.  it was just a big misunderstanding.  we didn't mean nothing bad. honest.  yay.  yay.  yay.  chad, that was so cool.  hey, just 'cause i'm a geek doesn't mean i'm not a cool geek.  i'll give you a ride home.  see you later, guys.  i'm going home with my big brother chad.   hey, chad, do that thing you do.   .. ) )
