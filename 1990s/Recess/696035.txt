 with more support than origami shorts.  gus: but what.  woman: oh, boys and girls, wh beautiful papiermch sculptures.  i've never seen a better collection of abstract expressionism representing man's struggle in an unkind world.  i was making my puppy.  let's get back and clean up.  and, billy, stop eating the paste.  papiermch.  tender.  how do i look.  badly injured.  what happened to him.  he's got a crushed pelvis.  can i sign the cast.  no.  i believe i matched the color of the originals.  am i dry yet.  as a bone.  good old quickdry and papiermch.  paint away, michelangelo.  sort of reminds me of my first volcano science project.  oops.  reminds me evenmore of my first volcano science project.  this is bad.  let's move.  learn anything.  three things one, they tried to make a papiermch patch.  two, there are five or six of them.  and three, i'm getting very warm.  who'd have thunk it would take us nine years to get to the last pickle.  kids today don't seem to know the joys of a good gherkin seems they're more taken with their video games and sequel movies.  that means more pickles for us.  let's go order another barrel.  hot dog.  anybody thinking what i'm thinking.  the classic barrel pants, as worn at one time or another by cartoon characters.  one pair of barrel pants coming up.  these just might catch on.  cozy.  cool.  tender.  whoa.  we're now witness to the downside of barrel pants.  spinelli: mikey, stop.  i can't.  your shell fall apart, turtle man.  me not turtle man.  me b wh g, hugeproblem.  hey, i'll trade you this comb for your toy car.  ooh.  mommy use on me.  now me use on enemies.  i'm not going in.  you go in.  i'm not going in.  thanks, dickey.  drive careful, problem boy.  you're alive.  way to think fast, but you can't walk around dressed like a car all day.  there's not enough trunk space.  well, what else can mikey wear.  we got to find something that doesn't tear.  and i know just the material.  wow, what are those.  space pants from one of my science projects.  they're made of titanium foil the former soviet union used.  where did you get that.  i traded for them over the internet.  i've got them to fit, but i had to take off my old ones.  forget your old ones.  i've made you the ultimate pants.  they're indestructible.  they're futuristic.  uhoh, litter.  this defies the laws of physics.  randall: miss finster.  miss finster.  barrel pants.  blumberg.  there go the culprits.  pursue, pursue.   : gretch, how can this be happening to your super pants.  mikey compromised the structural integrity of the material.  they're literally coming apart at the seams.  should've gotten thread from the soviet union.  miss finster: there they are.  : quick.  into the ashleys' clubhouse.  no way am i going in there.  it's mikey's only hope of avoiding the needle and the shame.  it's official.  the newest addition to the wall of acceptable boys is like, what areyou doing here.  yeah, no troglodytes allowed.  we need a place to lay low.  sorry, but we simply won't allow it.  i didn't want to have ..  mikey, show them your rips.   that was harsh, teej.  had to be done, vince.   hmm, terrified ashleys fleeing their own clubhouse.  it can only mean one thing.  randall, the bullhorn.  mikey blumberg.  come out right now.  i know about your pants.  friends, my capture and demise are inevitable.  go on without me.  you can look me up at my new school.  i'll be studying under the name dietrich von diego.  we've made too many pants to give up now.  miss finster: come out, or i'm coming in.  give us a minute.  looks like you got no choice.  i'm sorry you have to go wait a minute.  are you sure you want to do that.  it's the only way.  spinelli, let's go.  what the we're with you in spirit, guys.  children: underwear.  under there.  underwear. under there.  well.  he's not ready yet.  he isn't, is he.  blumberg, you have till the count of three.  ..2...  3.  there you are, mikey.  i guess your socalled friends abandoned you.  : wait.  what's all this, then.  miss finster, our trousers are torn.  we need them repaired.  they ripped their own pants so mikey wouldn't have to go it alone.  all: tidy whities.  tidy whities.  um, very well, boys.  follow me.  tidy whities.  ha ha ha ha.  enough.  that was the most courageous act this playground has ever seen.  we won't jeer.  we will show respect.  tthanks, gguys.  ffforget about it.  special" "the one thing that makes me different from any other kid .." go on.  that's all i could come up with.  every person has something they're good at, something that gives them their identity, that makes them special even you.  uh, well, i have hair.  so do many children.  you've been to 12 schools in 6 years.  how many kids can claim a record like that.  gee, you're right, miss grotke.  griswold, have a record a world record.  do i get a plaque.  i'm jared smith.  these are my transfer papers.  i trust they're in order.  you've certainly moved around a lot, jared.  i've been to 38 schools since kindergarten.  38 schools.  oh, goodbye, plaque.  why don't you just take a seat, and we'll get on with our lessons.  it's time to entertain our friends the numbers.  where were we on friday.  oh, yes long division.  es gretchen figure out the answer to this problem.  all right. gretchen.  in a simple problem like this, i quickly see that 0623, but if it were excuse me, gretchen.  you're only warm.  are you trying to say i'm wrong.  let's just say your answer lacks correctness.  i hate to be a knowitall, miss grotke, but i think the answer book must be mistaken again.  jared's got an answer.  no, i don't really.  according to jared, the answer is 167, then a little dot thingy, 0624.  oh, please.  no, wait. jared's right.  but that's impossi it looks like we have two math whizzes in our class.  38 schools since kindergarten.  he broke my record my only record.  i'm sure he cheated on that problem.  probably has wristwatch calculators.  so this guy's been through more schools than gus.  so he got one math problem quicker than gretchen.  i haven't been corrected by an adult since i was 3.  i've never been corrected by a peer.  you still have the highest score in history on that arkansas standard achievement test.  did i.  are you student 100.000.  uh, yeah.  i'm student 99.999.  nice to meet you.  i always thought you were a statistical abstraction.  i'm a regular kid like you.  only smarter hey, recess is awastin'.  what do you guys say we go play on the jungle gym.  yeah, last one to old rusty is a rotten egg soaked in hot sauce that someone spit on.  come on, gretchen.  come on, gus.  i'd hate to be some sort of yucky egg.  what have i got to lose.  come on, jared.  you, too.  i don't believe in competition.  it's just a race to the jungle gym.  okay.  whoa.  ooh, side ache.  me too.  you beat me.  yeah, well, you know, all in the spirit of fun.  what kind of shoes you got on.  same as yours.  so it's not the shoes.  i think i had adrenalin going, being new and all.  how are you at basketball.  okay. want to play.  maybe later.  sure.  man, that guy is good.  don't rub it in.   next.  perhaps young jared would enjoy the challenge.  no, i couldn't.  don't be afraid.  spinelli won't hurt you.  i have always wanted to try this.  sucker.  ah, big old slab of fresh meat.  somebody say " all: 1, 2, 3, go.  want to call it a tie.  ties are for father's day.  a muerte.  you sure.  i won't settle for less.  okay.a muerte.  you slammed me.  true, but you did very well, considering your size.   better get to class.  but but nobody's ever slammed me before, nobody.  there eating his perfect little lunch out of his perfect little seor fusion lunch box.  it makes me sick.  yeah, mr. 38 schools.  mr. faster than everybody.  mr. perfect.  is quality a crime.  excellence is something to be treasured, not scorned.  we should be proud to be in the presence of someone of jared's superior abilities.  just you wait till his superior abilities shine on you, pal.  i'll welcome it with open arms.  if love is beauty and love is blind, and it's out of sight and out of mind, then how can you be with me still like hummingbird and daffodil.  morning dew may dampen grass, but not our love that's here to last.  bravo, bravo.  bellissimma.  what a beautiful soul.  t guy.  how could this have happened.  i'm the best poet in fourth grade.  fair is foul, and foul is oh, i can't remember the rest of it.  you're overreacting.  look around, t.j.  the diggers can't dig 'cause jared's already dug the perfect hole.  the swinger can't swing 'cause jared's already swung over the top of the swing set eight times.  and look what he's done to tubby.  him used to be best burper in kindergarten.  then big kid jared make giant burp, shake windows.  now tubby say him never burp again.  , recess is a disaster.  you guys are letting this get to you.  m not upset.  you know the clackers miss finster confiscated last spring, the ones you said there was no plan good enough to get back.  jared just got them back.  jared's a menace, and he must be stopped.  i say we dress him in last year's ultra suede.  let's see him accessorize that.  i say we tell finster he's a communist.  perhaps we should visualize him gone.  i say we pummel the showoff.  he's inside lecturing the faculty on education.  no, no, miss grotke, you've got to scaffold kids, mentor their behavior.  what was cloudy is now clear.  fraternizing with the enemy.  add treason to his list of offenses.  that makes nine.   there is one thing we could do.  it's brutal, but it might do the trick.  instigate a lockout.  we haven't done one since we locked out that boogereating kid in first grade.  i got over it.  guys, it's the only way.  hi, guys.  what you digging.  can i help.  okay, i guess i'll just do a little swinging then.  hi, swinger girl.  mind if i join you.  we don't have to talk.  we'll just swing.  taken.  taken.  taken.  how about 3way.  only got two mitts.  want to play leave us alone.  okay, i'll bite.  what's going on around here.  you chose to come in here and beat us all at everything.  we choose to put a stop to it.  it's a lockout, pal.  get used to it.  i'm actually sort of impressed.  you guys really came up with a good one.  this happens at every school that i go to.  eventually the kids realize i'm good at stuff and shun me.  they all have their own way of doing it, but a schoolwide lockout.  that's a good one.  but before i spend recess in the library for the rest of the year, let me just say one thing.  all i wanted was to be friends with you guys.  i didn't tell miss grotke i knew the right answer to gretchen's problem or challenge vince to a foot race or spinelli to armwrestling.  you guys challenged me.  do you want me to pretend i'm no good.  i can't stop being good at stuff any more than gretchen can stop being smart or vince can stop being fast or mikey can stop being a sweetsouled giant.  most people don't get that about me right away.  i'd trade places with any of you guys any day.  you think it's easy being mr. perfect.  you think it's easy getting locked out or facing down angry m to find it full of papiermch mix.  we should have thought of that one.  all: shh.  you know how people say no matter how good you get, there's always someone out there who's better than you.  for me, it's different.  there might not be anybody better, but there's always somebody happier.  i just wanted to say that before i was locked out forever.  tubby: wait.  what the tubby want say something to perfect man.  what's that.   kid, you got chops.  "finally, it is my passion for military miniatures, "the love of a snake named herbert, "and much, much more "that make me someone extra special.
