   it's game day, lawson.  prepare to meet thy doom.  we creamed you guys last year.  we'll do it this year.  i'm shaking in my high tops.  spinelli: we've seen you fifth graders practice.  yeah, you guys whomp.  what was that.  you heard me.  you guys whomp.  that's it, detweiler.  it's go time.  "whomp" is t.j.'s word.  it doesn't mean anything.  what are you talking about.  will never get in trouble for swearing.  because of the verb " it all started back in second grade.  sorry i got you sent to the wall.  every kid knows you're not supposed to cuss in school.  hey, i repeated it.  it's just boogerhead that's a classic.  we need a word that doesn't mean anything.  that way when we stub a finger playing low ball or spill hot cocoa ..  we can yell without ending up at the wall.  but what's the word.  it's got to be short, sweet, and meaningless.  how about "sprocket".  that's part of a tractor.  "borscht".  some sort of dessert.  "phlegm".  too gross.  this making up stuff whomps.  "whomps" that's it.  miss finster: no giving skin at the wall.  so "whomps" doesn't mean anything.  you got it.  cool.   we got so wound up in detweiler's story, we missed recess.  this whomps.  what did you say.  " that's it, mr. potty mouth.  it's the principal's office for you.  but, miss finster, you don't understand.  guys, we got to do something.  bad language is an automatic level4 detention.  how could they possibly punish t.j.  for saying a word he invented.  this is a very serious situation, indeed.  we can't have bad language in school.  you see, bad language undermines authority.  it demonstrates impertinence, disrespect, laziness.  i can't keep up with your gutter slang, but miss finster assures me it's filthy.  i have no choice but to give you detention level 5.  level 5.  man, this whomps.  make that level 6.  are you ready to push me any further.  how long are they going to keep him in there.  i hope you've learned your lesson, son.  i've alerted the entire faculty.  your little word is now officially forbidden.  gretchen: did they let you do your homework.  or go to the bathroom.  sure, gus, but a trip to the boys' room can't buy back what they took from me.  they took my word, made it ugly and unclean.  2 can play that game or 200.  guys, i've got a plan.  okay, boys and girls, let's name our kickball teams.  okay, mr. klugey.  we're going to be the wild fish.  very clever, son. vince.  watch out, wild fish.  we're the whompers.    that word is off limits.  principal's office, pronto.  it's begun.  hi, mrs. lunch lady.  i'd like the salisbury steak, please, with blackeyed peas and a big whomping helping of mashed yams.   i whomped my finger in my desk.  spinelli.  now i have to send you to the principal's office.  i'm shooting for 3,000 whomps a world whomp record.   those platform shoes so totally whomp.   naming your class hamster whompy you people should be ashamed of yourselves.  please tell me these kids are here to present me with a "world's best principal" plaque.  just more kids saying the "w" word.  i can't stand it anymore.  i haven't had a moment's peace in days.  sign your names on the sheet by the door and get out of here.  who the heck is whompy whomperson.   that's it.  desperate times call for desperate measures.  man:, special services.  prickly here, from 3rd street.  one of my bad apples has spoiled the whole bunch, if you know what i mean.  you've got to help me.  hold.   okay, we're sending over mr. white.  you mean the cleaner.  if anyone can solve your problem, it's him.  and, prickly, don't use this line again.  let's see those little whompers laugh now.   look, a kowalski z77 blackhawk.  with board of ed.  insignia.  thank goodness you're here, mr. white.  about this bad language situation we could institute a nickelperuse law.  show me to your office.  i'd like some darjeeling tea and six vanilla cream sandwich cookies.  but this isn't teatime.  it's time for action.  first tea, then action.  who was that guy.  miss finster: detweiler.  someone wants to see you.  that's the whole story.  i made the word up.  it doesn't mean anything.  i understand completely, t.j.  you seem like a fine, wellmeaning young man.  you needn't worry about this anymore.  thanks a lot, mr. white.  prickly, this "w" word it's a cancer.  it must be removed.  removed.  it's that serious.  serious.  " "dang" started out as a harmless replacement for a certain bad word, but it spread like wildfire across playgrounds.  today it's no longer a standin for a bad word, but a bad word in its own right.  i let that one get away from me.  i'm not about to let that happen again.  the whomp stops here.  how do we do that.  by making an example of the boy who sparked the fire.  but how.  it's already in the works.  kids of the playground, i talked to their man white.  he assured me this whole thing was a misunderstanding.  from this day forth, no kid will ever again get in trouble " man: t.j. detweiler, freeze.  you others, step away from the kid.  son, you're coming with us.  all:. t.j.. t.j..  . t.j..  mr. white: it was then detweiler uttered a word so vile, i cannot bring myself to utter it in these hallowed halls, a word so dangerous, ladies and gentlemen, that if left unchecked, its usage could wend its way into our children's vernacular, eventually causing society to crumble and civilization to come to an end.  i love that man.  superintendent skinner, your decision is clear.  make an example of this miscreant.  expel him with extreme prejudice.  that way, no child will ever use this word again.  the board of education rests.  thank you, mr. white.  eloquent, powerful, and not just a little frightening.  detweiler, based on the evidence presented here, i have no choice miss grotke: wait.  superintendent skinner, i have a witness my old professor reginald dice weathersby, phd, slangologist.  dice is an expert in american slang, and he's agreed to speak on t.j.'s behalf.  what up, high binder.  i'm here to lay it out straight for the can.  very well, doctor.  proceed.  chill, shorty, and let me do the bobbering.  what did he say.  pad this, hammer man.  was just a boogler, hepping his aconas to a real gasser.  you can't dis the kins for egging the profs.  the big "w" ain't a word, ace.  this biggety egg don't hold no air.  superintendent, this man disgusts me to the core.  i demand his testimony be stricken and that he be forcibly removed.  this yank is starting to ag me.  i doubt this man is even an expert.  i did not spend 12 years studying at the world's finest universities just to be slandered by the likes of some civil servant.  civil servant.  why, you pinko egghead.  jackbooted thug.  commie brainiac.  whistles ] superintendent skinner, can i please speak for myself.  well, it's highly unusual in these hearings, but so is everything else here today. go ahead.  dice is trying to help me, but the stuff he's saying is from another time.  i also get what mr. white's trying to say.  new words just scare him, that's all.  but the thing is, sir, making up words is part of what being a kid is all about.  we're not looking for trouble.  i invented that word to stay out of trouble.  now, just 'cause someone thinks my word sounds bad, i have to stand here today defending myself.  if you ask me, this whole thing whomps.  sir, i tried to keep that terrible word out of the courtroom, but this young man whoa. wait a minute.  white, what terrible word are we talking about.  well, the word is "whomps," sir.  "whomps".  white, are you telling me this entire proceeding is over the word "whomps".  uh, yes, that's correct.  ha ha ha.  sir, i fail to see what's so funny.  the word that's what's so funny, white.  "whomps" it's a funny word.  no, it isn't, sir.  it's shameful filth.  its meaning is clearly obscene.  it doesn't mean anything obscene to me.  how about you, young lady.  i think it's just a clever and creative way " to me it means something's repellent or offensive.  that, or bodacious.  i think it's cute.  sounds like a type of fish to me.  and i think it's funny.  anyone who hears dirty meaning in this "whomps" word probably has a dirty mind.  the board of education has no control over what goes on inside people's minds.  i therefore find detweiler not guilty.  you're expected to be in school tomorrow morning.  it's sort of a hollow victory, huh, teej.  this whomps.  anybody seen spinelli.  we thought she was with you.  she was supposed to meet me, but she never showed up.  hey, there she is.  man: bye, pooky.  hey, spinelli, where you been.  i don't want to talk about it, okay.  why not.
