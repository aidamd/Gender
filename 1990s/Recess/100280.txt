 .   if everyone did everything their parents said that might stop the course of discovery.  nice try, arthur, but i doubt sir isaac newton made baconflavored shakes with his father's cooking equipment.  now, let's get this cleaned up.     wait.  arthur: watch this.  francine: my turn.  arthur: wow.  brain: good one, francine.  binky: that's nothing.  watch this.   oops.  binky, you just need a smaller rockone with a flat surface that will deflect the water downward thus gaining a net upward force.   thanks, buster.  watch this.   what.  i just found that.  what is it.  a chipped rock.  it's an arrowhead.  wow.  cool.  really.  where'd you get it.  i was digging in my mom's garden.  it was buried there.  i wonder who buried it.  no oneprehistoric tribes lived all over this area.  over time, rain and floods washed dirt over their tools.  you mean there could be stuff buried in our own yards.  certainlyall you have to do is dig.  cool. a helmet.    wow.  i'm not worried aboutancientruins.  it's themodernones i don't want to see.  but everybody else gets to dig intheiryards.  we're meeting later to show what we found.  i'll be careful.  really.  please.  all right.  i have to go do some errands now.  you can dig behind the garage but no place else.  i don't want an excavation site for a yard.  all right.  thanks, mom.  what are you burying, arthur.  your report card.  i'm digging for treasure.  what kind of treasurepennies.  arrowheads and civilizations and stuff.  hey, look at that.  it's alive.  watch it.  careful, d.w..  it's a root.  boy, you fell for that.  even the tibbles are too old for that gag, and they're only four.  i knew you were faking.  sure.  hey, want to trade some of your tiny dimes for a big, shiny penny.  wait till everyone hears how you thought that root was a snake.   what's this.  "digestive biscuits." what's "digestive".  likereader's digest,i guess.  what a dumb flavor.  ahh... there's got to be something decent down there.  i found something.  wow. it might belong to a sabertoothed tiger or at. rex,or...  pal.  this bone belongs to pal, arthur.  huh.    i bet everyone else has found lots of stuff by now.   too small.  duh.     drat.   there's nothing here.   hey.   arthur read...  you know you're not supposed to dig in the yard.  i'm not going to dig.  i'm going to watch pal.  it's not very big.  and not very neat, either.  maybe i could just fix it.  you're not fixing it.  you're making it bigger.  mom's going to plotz.  come on, d.w., i'm just digging a little until i find the stuff that's buried back here.  like what stuff.  like...  i don't know...  like...    wow.  cool.  looks like nobody's been down here for a while, pal.  it's huge.  well, this is it.  it might be some ancient temple, or it might be a trap.  only one way to find out.  oh, my gosh.   arthur, what were you doing in my closet.  you want half a sandwich.  you really think there's secret passages.  there's probably old tunnels that go everywhere.  it's worth a try.  and it's not just for me...  oh, no.  what is it, honey.  i forgot to get charcoal and the stores are closed.  i guess we'll just have to cancel the barbecue.  arthur: no, we don't.  i'll be right back.  with tax, that's... let's see...  there.  honey, i think these are the best hot dogs you've ever cooked.  thanks to arthur and his secret passage.  it's a good thing you didn't listen to me.  "it's a good thing you didn't listen to me".  you really believe mom's going to say that.  well... she might.  and anyway, we'll never find a secret passage if we don't even look for it.  but mom said...  okay, fine, you're right.  if you want to be a barbecue wrecker we'll just play in the dirt behind the garage.  come on, let's go find some more tin cans.  that's much better than a secret passageway.  well, maybe you could dig just a little.  nothing.  we must have the most boring backyard in history.  maybe we're just looking in the wrong places.  but i looked every... wait a second.  who says we have to stay in the backyard.  no, arthur, that's not...  francine: there he is.  hi, arthur.  we were waiting back at the pond.  you must have found something big.  well, not yet.  really. we all found great stuff.  what. a metal detector.  no, these.  pennies.  they're not in mint condition but over 30 years old.  gee, they had coins way back then.  oh, yesthe first coins were made thousands of years ago.  i found something much cooler.  i think it looks like an iguana.  i'm calling it inguan.  you gave a name to a root.  i name all my roots.  look what i found.  it's been lost for years.  it's still in good shape.  not as good as this.  it has a price tag.  you didn't find that in your backyard.  i didn't say i did.  i bought it, but jewels do come out of the ground.  what did you find, arthur.  roots and rocks, mostly.  i didn't name them, though.  and this.  all: cool.  you think that's cool.  it's old, that's for sure.  i estimate that it's over 40 years old.  that's how old my mom is.  that's ancient.  wow. and look at this.  did i find something else cool.  you're lucky.  your mom let you dig up the whole yard.  oh, no. did i do all that.  yesi told you.  what am i going to do.  you're going to be in big trouble.  maybe we can get everything back the way it was.  we did it.  arthur. what happened.  there were these giant earthworms, mrs. read.  they went crazy, but we tried to stop them.  actually, it was chipmunks.  they burrowed...  chipmunks don't burrow.  moles, however...  thanks, guys but... it was my fault.  i guess i got carried away.  i'm sorry, mom.  after i specifically told you not to.  i'm disappointed in you, arthur...verydisappointed.  you want to go to the pond after school.  sorry, i'm doing something cooler.  look what i found yesterday.  a harmonica. where did you find it.  in the garage.  there's cool things in there.  sometimes what a treasure is depends on how you look at it.  you're grounded and have to clean the garage all week.  pretty much, yeah.  brain: that's okay, you can come next week.  arthur: better make it the weekafternext.  kids: and now...  we dig a lot of holes.  arthur digs holes to find treasure.  we dig holes to plant our plants...  because it's a garden club.  girl: the garden club's purpose is to make our school look more colorful.  girl 2: kids get to bring in as many plants as they want.  we all work together to plant them.  today we're planting red geraniums.  we're going to make it beautiful.  you dig a hole...  try to make the hole nice and big and wide enough for the pot to fit in.  hold onthat's good.  and then we put the plant in it.  there you go.  good.  we patted the soil down.  pat it down really hard.  those are the steps.  good job, jamal.  thank you.  wow.  it's a horseshoe.  you guys.  look what we founda horseshoe.  boy: was it buried.  yeah, we were just digging and all of a sudden i just saw this old thing right in there.  and now...  whoa.  this fair is so cool.  it's just like being in the middle ages.  stick with your partner and take notes on the historical details.  they'll be useful when we compete.  get your haggis here.  fresh haggis, two for a dollar.  haggis.  two for...  a dollar.  what's haggis.  there it isthe golden griffin.  the award given to the class which exhibits the greatest knowledge of medieval history.  boy, mr. ratburn sure wants to win that golden griffin.  we came so close to winning last year.  if we all try our hardest i'm sure this is the year we finally win.  i bet we can win because what class on earth works as hard as we do.   class: glenbrook, glenbrook, that's our school.  glenbrook, glenbrook, we will rule.  go... glenbrook.  it can't be.  ah, ratburn.  we meet again.   hey.  mr. prycejones, my old teacher.  i didn't know you were still at the glenbrook academy.  they won't let me quit.  after all, iamirreplaceable.  huh.   oh, no.  prycejones:..  siena, avignonwe've won all the medieval fairs in europe.  this little one should be a snap.  excuse me, sir but it's 10:14.  well, time to prepare.  see you at merlin's labyrinth.  don't get lost along the way.   arthur: have we ever played soccer against those guys.  they seem kind of familiar.  no way.  i'd remember a weirdlooking bunch like that.  the first to escape a point shall win the other one shall rish within.  remember, chester, navigate by the su and the tops of the trees.  arthur, use your head.  on your mark, get set...  hie thee hence.  that means "go," kid.  oh, no, dead end.  hmm, my shadow.   guess i really used my head.  announcer: he or she who pulls the sword from the stone truly is our king or queen.  'tis an equalopportunity sword.  keep the line moving.  all your might won't set things right.  'tis a gentle hand 'twill rule the land.   francine: arthur.  everyone's looking for you.  we lost at merlin's maze.  time for the next competition.  let's see you beatthat.    quick, lads and lasses.  v = u + at.  now.   i see they don't know newton's formula for constant acceleration yet.  the clocks are ticking, ratburn.  we're getting pulverized.  we might as well just give them the golden griffin.  we're playing against robots.  i feel sorry for them having that teacher.  ratburn: actually, buster mr. prycejones was the best teacher i ever had.  some people sayi'mtough.  no.  who saysthat.  but mr. prycejones made us learn latin in third grade.  class: sum, es, est, sumus, estis, sunt.  again.  sum, es, est sumus, estis, sunt.  ratburn: and at recess, he pushed us to the limits of our strength.  i learned a lot.  makes me wonder sometimes if i'm not a tough enough teacher.   mmm.  this capon is good.  it tastes just like chicken.  caponischicken.   i have some extra figgy pudding for the student who can answer a question.  me, please. me. me.  commendable enthusiasm, children.  but let's give lakewood first try.  who was the 16th king of england.  what.  you haven't taught them the song, ratburn.  winky, csharp, please.    here's a song that's more historical than musical    to teach the kings of england in the order categorical...    and now you know a wondrous thing...     all 42 english kings.    i know you don't agree with all of my teaching methods, ratburn.  but you have to admit, they're more effective.  the fact is, you can't beat us.  you may be right, sir.  did you hear that.  if we keep losing mr. ratburn may start teaching us like that guy.  we have to win something.  but how.  we can't beat them.  mr. prycejones just said so, and he's always right.  there must be something we're good at.  aha.  a mincemeat pieeating contest.  this should be no sweat, buster.  are you hungry, champ.  yepgood thing i didn't win that figgy pudding.  on ye mark, get set...  tuck in.  buster: must...  eat...  more.   buster: i don't understand.  how can you keep eating.  where does it all go.  over the past few weeks i've expanded my stomach with giant breakfasts.  i now have an 18liter capacity.  pass the ice cream, please.   we're so lucky they had tennis in the middle ages.  muffy's been playing since she was five.  huh.  this isn't a regulation tennis ball.  it weighs a ton.  they played with it in the 16th century.  and this racket.  that looks like it could have been used by henry viii.  it was used by henry v.  he was my greatgreatgreatgreatgreatgreatuncle.  you can do it, brain.  i know you can.  no one's smarter than you.  the wheel of fortuna is constantly spinning.  someone is losing and someone is winning.  all right, for 20 points what do all the planets revolve around.  the sun.  that was easy.  oh, i'm sorry but the correct answer is "the earth." those points go to i.q..  huh. but that's wrong.  you have to give the answers that were thought to be correct during the middle ages.  we've lost for sure now.  might as well get something to eat.  eat.  you just had six pies.  i feel empty inside.  you go ahead.  there's something i want to do.   why won't you move..  haney: after seeing your results i know the children would benefit if you taught them.  well, it's a generous offer.  i'll definitely consider it.  hey, arthur, want to try a unicorn dog.  it tastes like capon.  i think principal haney wants to replace ratburn with mr. prycejones.  it's because we've lost every single game.  we've disgraced mr. ratburn.  mr. prycejones will probably hold us back for years so he can teach us over and over again.  all that's left is a castlebuilding contest.  if we win that, maybe mr. haney will reconsider.  mmm, excellent crenellations.  huh.... oh.  smooth.  well, this is a very creative piece of work.  he really likes it.  i think we won.  but unfortunately, the contest is for the most historically accurate castle.  therefore, i must award the prize to glenbrook.  kids: yay. we won.  veni, vidi, vici. we will defeat ye.  you e, these arrow slits are much too wide.  and in old english, "lakewood" would have an "e" on the end.  ratburn: i just want you all to know i'm very proud.  i'm going to have this castle put on display at school.  mr. ratburn doesn't even know he's being replaced.  i feel so sorry fohim.  him. what aboutus.  my brain hurts just thinking about mr. prycejones.  hey, where's arthur.  all your might won't set things right.  'tis a gentle hand 'twill rule the land.  hey, i've got it.   whew.  francine: arthur.  would you quit playing with that stupid sword.  we have to go.   kids: wow.  we have a new king.  i hereby proclaim you, arthur read king of the medieval fair.  arthur outthought not only all my students but even me.  i couldn't budge that sword.  you taught that boy to think for himself.  i couldn't have done it better.  principal haney is mr. prycejones still going to be our teacher. ) )
