 whoohoo.  way to go, spinelli.  nice sack.  if we can hold them for one more play, we win the game.  one more time, you're going down.  mommy.  thanks a lot, spinelli.  there goes another quarterback.  you could always do it, lawson.  what do i look like, dumb.  let's see who i can get.  johnny v., you're in.  .  gee, thanks a lot, lawson.  yeah, yeah, don't thank me.  just throw the ball, okay.  they're using babytooth johnny as quarterback.  this is going to be a cinch.  we got one more down before the bell rings.  might pull something big.  yeah, maybe he'll finally lose that baby tooth of his and get the tooth fairy to help them win the game.  76, 73.  hut1, hut2, hike.  here we go, fourth graders.  here we go.  here we go, fourth graders.  here we go.  sorry, babytooth.  it's time to get pulled out.   whoohoo.  ..17.  we win.  unh.  i don't get it.  i had that stupid babytooth dead in my sights, and i just choked.  it was kind of weird.  maybe you're hungry.  my stomach is feeling kind of woozy.  perhaps you're suffering from some physiological malady that could be uncovered by running an ekg.  i'll get my equipment.  i think spinelli should just go see the nurse.  why not.  there's got to be something wrong.  well, you don't have a temperature.  how come i can't cream .  i don't know that name.  have i examined him.  he's that frecklefaced, babytoothed, fifthgrade dope.  oh, i see.  well, i don't.  what gives, nurse kay.  run along.  there is absolutely nothing wrong with you.  this is all just a part of your blooming.  blooming.  what does she think i am, a daffodil.  man:killer mcgee climbs to the top turnbuckle, and, oh, man.  a double death drop.  i doubt the special will walk for a month.  doesn't get better than this, huh, pookie.  yeah, i guess.  is something the matter, kiddo.  we got a "death cage" matchup on, and you act like we're watching the peace and humanity channel.  sorry, dad.  what's wrong.  you can tell your old man.  well, you see, dad, there's this boy at school, and stop right there. honey.  what is it, dear.  she doesn't care about wrestling, and there's a boy at school.  tell me, sweetie, does it feel like somebody punched you in the stomach.  sort of.  aw.  our little pookie has a crush.  i got a what.  hey, spinelli, you want to play this new old game like you heard about.  it's called kicketycan.  no, thanks.  i got a lot on my mind.  this game sounds really neat.  according to the rules, teams of players repeatedly kick a can until said can is completely crumpled and mashed.  maybe another time, guys.  i got some thinking to do.  later, okay.  spinelli thinking rather than kicking something.  i never thought i would see the day.  yeah, she's been acting really weird lately.  i have a thought.  my galileo computer is equipped with a personality analyzer program.  all i have to do is input the data on spinelli.  it'll explain what's going on in her head.  i'd be delighted to receive your data.  first of all, spinelli failed to tackle johnny v.  then she started complaining about a woozy stomach.  then she started thinking instead of kickie and time zone, i'd say your spinelli has an infatuation.  an infatuation.  is it fatal.  what i mean is, spinelli is smitten.  she has a crush, presumably on this johnny v. character.   a cruguys, for spinelli's sake, this can never get out.  agreed.  together: agreed.  ha ha ha.  how delightful.  what are you monkeys smiling at.  just the fruits of cupid's folly.  somebody want to translate that.  your youknowwhat on youknowwho.  don't worry, spinelli.  your secret's safe with us.  attention, kids.  now hear this spinelli has a crush on johnny v.  i repeat the great spinelli is a boyliker.   knock it off or i'll smack you.  yeah, right in the kisser.   what's so funny.   i'm so ashamed.  it ain't your fault, johnny.  just dumb luck.  how come i'm the one who had to get a stupid crush on some stupid boy.  i think it's sweet.  sweet is me clobbering that clown with my monster moves, but this this stinks.  my whole life is messed up royally now.  we're part of your life.  nothing's changed between us.  right, even if you are a boyliker.  we're going to treat you like the same old spinelli.  i'm still going to be afraid you'll punch me in the arm.  you guys don't feel differently about me.  gee, guys, i don't know what to say.  well, i say let's play.  okay, operation mango fritter is a go.  vince, gretch, you got your assignments.  now we need someone to cover the flank.  i'll take it, teej.  don't you worry your pretty little head.  you just keep thinking about songs and junk.  gus, you take the flank.  here's what you need to do.  children: boyliker.  boyliker. boyliker.  ew. kissy girl.  run away. run away.   hey, spinelli.  oh, great.  now you powder puffs are going to start with me.  no, spinelli.  we, like, understand.  you do.  come. follow us.  all right, what's so important you had to ..  see, spinelli, we're boylikers, too.  and these are the boys we adore.  that one looks like a girl.  isn't he dreamy.  this is jed marker, loves, and this is bret jamal , , and cody hunter iii formoi, and this one is for you.  together: caravaggio.  isn't he, like, the cutest.  you're going to make me barf my lunch.  then keep your johnny v.  i don't want johnny v.  some boyliker she turned out to be.  aah.  lousy rotten ashleys and their lousy rotten wall of boys.  as far as i'm concerned, i don't care if i never see that rotten johnny v. again.  aah.  together: aah.  hmm. strange goingson.  spinelli: i hate him.  i hate him more.  i hate him.  i hate him more.  well, well, well, if it isn't little spinelli.  miss finster, ii didn't pick anything out of prickly's private garden no need to hand me a line.  i see what's going on here.  you you do.  running from boys, getting laughed at it's an ageold story.  women of power like us, we're not allowed to have emotions.  you can say that again.  first you worry that you're going soft, then you get that woozy feeling in your stomach.  hey, yeah, exactly.  then the family sawbones tells you it's not a peptic ulcer, so that leaves just one possibility love.  ew. my life is over.  that's where you're wrong.  this is just the beginning.  you're going to be faced with feelings like this every day, feelings that are going to make you want to stand on the rooftop and yell to the heavens, feelings that are going to make you crawl into a hole and pull off your skin.  even if he does leave you in paris with no money and a broken axle, in the end, it's all worth it.  it's better to feel something than nothing at all.  and i'll tell you something else.  the rest of the kids they don't know it yet but they're going to have those feelings someday, and that someday is coming sooner than they think.  are you sure about that.  positive.  so do me a favor get back out there and play.  johnny v.: 16, 77, hike.  well, here goes nothing.   l'amour, toujour l'amour.  let's go, fourth grade.  they're creaming us.  that's 'cause we've got no pass rushing.  we're doomed.  don't worry, guys.  the spinelli express just pulled into the station.  all: spinelli.  what are you doing here.  heard you need a pass rusher.  what about your condition.  my condition has nothing to do with playing football.  now let's do it.  oh, no, it's her.  she might try and kiss me.  relax, babytooth.  she can't touch you now.  she's in love, remember.  oh, yeah.  now let's go for the bomb and end this thing.  17, 66, hike.  you're going down, babytooth.  girl: way to go.  whoa, spinelli, you creamed me, and you knocked out my baby tooth.  wow. thanks.  who cares about your stupid tooth, baby.  we lost he game.  and i lost a nickname.  see ya.  good to have you back, spinelli.  good to be back.    hey, guys, wait up.  come on, spinelli.  uh, put some velocity on that stinking sphere.  nothing beats a good old game of kickball.  the sport no kid should miss out on.  lucky out, detwhomper.  no decent kid, that is.  it's mine.  i said as if, and then daddy snapped his fingers and said, "wolfgang, " i got it. i got it.  ooh, t.j.  i blame myself.  oh, man, i can hardly look.  he caught the stupid ball.  i broke my collarbone.  the less i move, the quicker it'll heal.  how long.  five weeks.   i can't help beat the fifth graders, but i could come give them the evil eye.  where do you think you're going.  uh, recess.  school policy strictly prohibits children with serious injuries from setting foot on the playground.  where else am i supposed to go.  across the hall and down the stairs to room 51.  you, there.  put down that banana.  now, don't that paint a purty picture, detloser spending his recess in room 51 with the pale kids.  pale kids. who are they.  the kids who actually choose to stay inside during recess.  the uncoolest of the uncool.  uncooler than me.  and t.j.'s going to be their buddy.  i wouldn't be surprised if t.j. became a pale kid.  he doesn't know what he's talking about.  ever heard of tiny sedgwick.  three years ago, tiny sedgwick was a regular kid just like you and me, but one day everything changed.  it was a monday.  the recess bell had just rung, and all the kids came out to play, then out limps tiny sedgwick.  the doofus had a busted leg from playing pickle with his shoes untied, so now instead of going out on the playground, guess where finster sends him to room 51.  and they never saw him again.  the pale kids got tiny sedgwick, and they're going to get you, too, paleweiler.  ha. paleweiler.  i kill myself.  now, where was i.  ah, yes, room 51.  march, young man.  gus:. don't go.  you don't got to worry about me.  i'm having nothing to do with any pale kids.   hark. an outsider.  gandor primulan,outsider.  live well and thrive.  i am frank.  these are my comrades ..  ..  and carl.   steve, readings, please.  boyoyoyoyoyoy.  it appears he has fractured his clavicle.  hence his assignment to recess here to room 51.  make yourself at home, newcomer.  anyway, back to waterloo, where wellington is holding off napoleon's army.  did they try to erase your brain.  one seemed to be trying, but i scared him off.  hang tough, teej.  you were meant to be one of us.  i know, spinelli, and don't worry i got them right where i want them.  i'm designing a supertech jet that reconfigures into a robot.  brilliant, steve, but regard this my robot turns into a flying dinosaur.  note the receptors for wing regeneration spores.  groovy.  groovy.  ha ha ha.  red leader one, red leader one.   hey, there.  aah.  we were wondering if you wanted to play with us.  oh, sorry about your thing.  half the fun of playing with a constructocrystal roboborg is
