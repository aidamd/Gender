 but especially, i think, for your son.  rise and shine, private.  huh. what.  it's 0600, soldier, and it's picture day.  yes, sir.  10hut.  private griswald reporting, sir.  ready for inspection.  very good, private. shoes.  shined, sir.  belt buckle.  polished, sir.  shirt.  on, sir, and tucked into my pants.  private, you look great.  thanks, pop, uh, sir.  this is an historic day for the griswald family.  make us proud.  i'll do my best, sir.  i'll do my best.  oh, man, picture day whomps.  it's bad enough i got to be seen looking like this, but there's also going to be a photograph to prove it.  i'm burning every picture i find.  if i ever grow up and become a parent, no matter how mad i get, i'm never going to picture day my kids.  hey, guys.  boy, you're all looking good.  so, what time do we get our picture taken.  hope it's early.  they schedule it according to grade kindergartners first, first graders second, and so on.  logically, we would go last.  this has got to be some kind of horrible mixup.  no, there's no mixup.  i volunteered the fourth grade to go last.  mikey: but why.  because as courteous world citizens, i know how meaningful it is to you to let others go first.  but that means we have to stay clean the whole day.  that's impossible.  i've got a 10pound bow on my head.  everyone remain calm.  let me figure this out.  oh, what's the point.  this is a disaster.  a disaster.  of course it's a disaster.  just look at this thing.  no. don't you see.  if you guys get messy, what's the big deal.  you've already got pictures from all your grades, but with all my family's moving around, i've never been in school long enough to take a class picture.  spinelli: you've never had a class picture before.  that's why i was so excited, now this.  i just wanted to make my parents proud.  look, i'm just a kid.  this picture day it doesn't make any sense to me, but the fact is we're stuck with it.  i'm listening to the junk he says.  i'm thinking to myself maybe this day doesn't have to be so meaningless, and i'm starting to figure if i can help gus make his parents proud, well, just maybe that's good enough for me.  gus, what the heck.  i'll keep you clean.  no one's messing you up, not while i'm around.  dirt wants you, it's got to take me out first.  just hide behind me, gus, and everything will be all right.   kindergartners, i repeat, kindergartners, report to the photographer at once.  : spinelli, tighten it up on the left.  vince, birddog those third graders.  everybody, if you see a dirt clod, walk around it.  if we're careful, i think we'll make it.  smile at clowny mcclown "  good enough.  picture finish. we free.   first graders, i repeat, first graders, report to the photographer at once.  first graders.  that's us.  it's almost over.  almost over for them, the lucky saps.  uhoh, we got trouble.  kindergartners at 6:00.   oh, man, there must be 30 of them, and they're coming this way.   aah.  ha ha ha.  just keep moving.  don't let them out of your sight.  aah. like, i'm hit.  we need help.  dry cleaner. dry cleaner.  second graders, i repeat, second graders, you're up.  okay, all clear.  it's juice time.  maul ball.   man, all this humping across country sure does make me thirsty.  when this is all over, i'm heading straight for kelso's and ordering me an extralarge glass of root beer.  yeah, me, too.  what are you going to do when picture day's over.  i'm dreaming of a messy game of british bulldog, but first i'm going to take some special time to cream any kid who makes a wisecrack about this hair.  how about you, mikey.  ..  i guess i'm going to play some maul ball.  get rid of it, mikey.  boy: tackle the big kid.   run, mikey. run.  whoa.  vince.  you guys go on.  i'll be okay.  tackle him, too.  children: yeah.  he was going to wear that suit to church.  we knew going into this some of us might get dirty.  now, come on.  we got to keep moving.  third graders, i repeat, third graders.  fifth graders, here now.  oh, man, look at that playground.  there sure are a lot of messy kids out there.  don't worry, gus.  it should be our turn pretty soon.  i see first graders, second graders, everyone except for the kindergartners.  where are the kindergartners.   hey, look, clean people.  get them.  run.  the running stride of the fourth grader is longer than that of the kindergartner, therefore aah.  what. my bow.  all right, all right, i surrender.  not without a fight you don't.  save gus.  over here.  down.  we're not going .  vince, mikey, spinelli, gretchen they got them all.  there's just too many of them.  i can't take it anymore.  hey, hey, hey, here.  you'll be okay.  we're safe in here.  thanks, teej.    hey, neat.  where'd you get that.  took it off a messy kid.  that music, it makes me think of home.  you guys, you got moms and dads back home, too, but here you are getting all messy for me.  won't your folks be disappointed.  sure, they'll be disappointed, but the way i see it is this if i didn't stand up for my buddy when he was down, well, then i'd be disappointed in myself.  from where i stand, the choice isn't that hard to make.  finster: fourth graders, i repeat, fourth graders, report to the photographer at once.  that's us.   now everybody's getting messy.  we'll never make it back to the photographer.  we got out here without getting messed up.  we survived maul ball and the kindergartners.  gus, i got to think luck's on our side.  you're right, t.j.  let's do it.  aah.  we're going to make it.  we're almost there.  what have we here.  lawson.  smile and say cheese.  go to the photographer, gus.  but go.  say your prayers, detweiler.  big messy can full of cheese.  all: gus.  yeah, you made it.  he's about to take the picture.  lawson: any last requests, cheeseweiler.  i know.  how about a cracker.  get it.  crackers and cheese.  ha ha ha.  gus, come on.  hey, you want a blindfold, detweiler.  i wouldn't want my eyes getting full of cheese.  get it. cheese.  cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese.  ha ha ha ha.  t.j.'s voice: and so whatever you think about all the junk that happened on picture day, i just figured i should let you know i'm proud of him anyway, and i'm honored to be his friend.  respectfully yours, theodore j. detweiler.   enter.  classified satellite photos, sir fresh off the bird this morning.  what do you think of this photo.  ..  i don't really have sufficient training to analyze photographs.  no. take a closer look.  that's my son right there near the middle in his first class picture ever.  if you ask me, soldier, well, i'd say he's never looked better.  like, there, that's my good side, as if i had a bad one.  hello, ladies.  isn't it a lovely day.  would you utterly mind.  you're ruining my portrait.  yeah, why don't you, like, bug.  sorry.  do it over.  it doesn't accurately reflect my new nose.  wait a second.  wasn't i about to sit there.  tough toenails, blumberger cheese.  i snagged it first.   mikey, you don't have to take that kind of noise.  don't let chumpy push you around.  this is a free country.  it's okay, guys.  technically, he was the first boy on the swing.  but you were clearly first in the swing area.  guys, i appreciate what you're saying, but it's okay.  the fact is i'm pretty used to stuff like this by now.  he's too darn nice for his own good.  hey, lummox, that was mine.  sorry.  mikey, there you are.  man, i couldn't sleep a wink last night.  i just kept thinking about viciously pummeling all the chumps who push you around.  that's sweet, spinelli, but i'm over it, really.  in fact, i slept like a baby.  mikey, i didn't see you coming, pal.  here, have my swing.  that's okay.  i'm not really in the mood.  no, no, i insist.  it's dew free and all nice and warm.  well, if you insist.  how's that, pal.  high enough for you.  fine. thank you.  that was a nice thing you just did, phil.  though it is a bit strange.  yesterday you were walking all over mikey, but today you're bending over backwards to be obsequious.  yeah, and you're kissing up to him.  it's just, well, i heard things.  things. what things.  word is last night at the marionette theater some kid knocked mikey's popcorn out of his hands.  go on.  well, mikey blew a fuse and then hauled the kid across the lobby where he pushed him into the girls' bathroom.  what did you say.  i'm just telling you what i heard.  they say the kid's going to miss a month of school.  gretchen: i've been in the girls' room untold times and never once experienced trauma.  for guys, it would be worse than getting kissed.  mikey would never do something that bad.  gosh, no.  that would be dehumanizing, degrading, and morally wrong.  you see, phil, this story's totally bogus.  what you heard was just an ugly rumor.  and whoever started it should be ashamed of himself.  now come on, phil, who told you. spill.  i shouldn't say.  look, you think you should be scared of mikey, but you know you should be scared of me, right.  i heard it from randall.  randall. figures.  can i go now.  uh, sure.  we've got to nip this thing in the bud or it's going to spread over the playground.  what do you say we pay randall a visit.  way ahead of you, vin.  nobody goes around telling lies about my friends.  wait, guys, it's no big deal.  i mean, sticks and stones can break my bones, but mysterious rumors can't hurt me, right.  mikey, telling lies about you is just another way of pushing you around.  it's the kind of thing you have to stand up against.  this is where we draw a line in the blacktop.  enjoy your little game, suckers.  playing keep away warrants a level 4 detention.  aah. hey, no sneaking around.  that's my job.  randall, we know you made up that rumor what. me.  i can't make stuff up.  when you're the class snitch, all you've got is your credibility.  aah. hi, mikey.  you're looking large.  please don't throw me in the girls' room.  i swear i'll never snitch on you.  here, you want some candy.  wow. thanks.  if you didn't start that lousy rumor, who did.  hey, i can't reveal my source.  it's against the snitch code of honor.  but isn't tattling on others precisely what snitches do.  hmm. good point.  digger dave told me this morning.  i think we ought to bring tunnel five by the big tree.  i don't know.  there's a lot of roots.  hey, digger dave, we need to talk.  we've got a massive project underway.  could that project possibly be weaving a tissue of lies.  uh, we just dig.  what did the diggers say.  it's him.  curse these roots.  come on, you guys.  drop the act.  we all know that rumor's just a bunch of hooey.  that's not how cornchip girl tells it.  aha.   well, well, i figured i'd be seeing you.  it's about that rumor, ain't it.  level with us, butch.  did you start it.  i hope so.  my feet are killing me.  sorry, i'm not your man, though i've got to admit it's a heck of a yarn.  whoever cooked it up is a real master.  we're mainly concerned with stopping this thing from spreading any further.  we've already tracked it through 15 kids.  15. that ain't no rumor.  that's a bona fide legend.  say, how are you doing there, mikey.  you want a stick of gum.  it's minty fresh.  heck, just take the whole pack.  thanks, butch.  hey, it squirts.  i'm getting tired, so once and for all, who started this lousy buzz.  don't know, spinelli, but i can tell you i heard it from a pretty reliable source from the big guy, the mustachioed one himself.  principal prickly.  the very same.  friends, it appears we've traced the lies to the highest office in the land.  y would principal prickly start a rumor about me.  who knows.  we're all just marbles in his sinister game of chinese checkers.  we're going to see the man.  and just where do you think you're going.  we need to see principal prickly, menlo.  we just want to ask him about these mikey rumors.  sorry. he's in conference.  i'll have to ask you children to leave.  don't let him hurt me.  principal prickly read it in my daily interoffice memo.  you made up some lie just to have something to run through the photocopier.  no, no, i didn't make it up. i swear.  i'll give you to the count of three.  who told you ..  i got it from randall yesterday.  he was helping miss finster, and we got to talking.  oh, don't toss me in the girls' room.  : wait.  did you say yesterday.  yeah, at lunchtime. why.  randall said digger dave told him this morning.  the weasel lied to us.  all roads lead back to the snitch.  he's probably still in the tires.  no, wait.  it's time to end this witch hunt.  you heard butch.  i'm a legend already.  there's nothing more we can do.  mikey, i understand how you feel, but this thing's bigger than you now.  if randall really did start the story, then he lied about lying, and that's just sick.  all this deceit makes me queasy.  and it's time we put a stop to it.  now come on.  and you won't believe what this kid saw.  ooh, don't tell me.  it's too much.  the poor slob.  see ya, randall.  where are you going.  i didn't tell you the part about the toilet paper.  toilet paper.  i never heard that part.  that's our proof.  you're the one.  no, i swear.  that toilet paper angle was just an embellishment, poetic license.  i'm about to take poetic license with your face.  i did not make it up.  somebody told me.  oh, yeah. who.  well, you guys are going to laugh, but see, i don't really know.  he did make it up.  by the power vested in me by my fist, i hereby declare you guilty of making up junk about mikey.  your sentence a firstclass ticket to the girls' room.  no, no, i'm innocent, i tell you, innocent.  you guys wouldn't do that, would you.  if you push him into the girls' room, you'll be doing the thing you said was horrible.  he's going to get a taste of his own imagination.  i'll tell you, but you're not going to believe me.  try us.  well, it all started yesterday.  i was on my way to homeroom when i decided to play the slots.  nuts.  lady luck wasn't with me.  it happens.  just as i'm about to leave, the phone starts ringing.   so i figure i better answer it.  uh, hello.  man: listen carefully.  the story i'm about to tell you is true, but you can't repeat it to anyone, understand.  you know mikey blumberg.  last night at the marionette theater some kid knocked mikey's popcorn...  and that's how i heard the rumor.  from some mysterious gravelly voiced stranger.  wacky, ain't it.  more like impossible.  wait till you see the pink toilet paper we've got in the girls' room, randall.  no, not that.  anything else a pink belly, noogies, a wedgie.  it's what you deserve.  no. don't do it.  stop.  what are you doing, mikey.  run away, randall.  you're free to go.  you saved me.  you're no monster.  you're nice.  i've got to go tell everybody.  what did you set him loose for, mikey.  the lousy worm deserved what was coming to him.  he lied about you.  no, spinelli, he didn't.  i lied about me.  what.  randall's telling the truth.  mine was the voice on that pay phone.   i started the rumor.  i used my singing voice.  why would you start a rumor about your own self.  i guess i was tired of being pushed around.  i just wanted people to think differently of me.  i wanted a little respect.  i never dreamed my tiny acorn of a lie would grow into a great gnarled oak of deceit.  hey, being known as a mean kid may scare people, but it doesn't earn respect.  you need to stand up for yourself.  vince: yeah, mikey.  just say no once in a while.  you'll get all the respect you deserve.  it's awful nice of you not to be mad after all that hunting witches.  hey, it gave us a break from kickball.  but i am ready to get back to it.  good point. come on.  let's go play kickball.  no.  what.  i said no.  i don't want to play.  i believe he's standing up for himself.  well, okay, mikey.  what do you want to do.  i'd prefer to dance.  hey, you've got to respect the guy.  captions by vitaccaptions paid for by abc cable networks group ariel, stop it.  eee.  it's a beautiful day.  who wants to go swim.  hah.
