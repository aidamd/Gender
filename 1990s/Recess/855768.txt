printed page.  the basement of boredom.  hey, we're cutting into playtime.  let's grab our books and get out of here.  excuse me, but do you have  so many pages, so few pics.  eeny, meeny, miney hey,

like a ghost.  doesn't sound like anybody i know.  mikey: it wasn't anybody you know.  it was the library kid.  the library kid.  of course.  the library kid.  would somebody please tell me what you're talking about.  the library kid, gus a strange being who lives in the stacks and never comes out.  some say she was dropped in the afterhours book deposit when she was a babe.  others say her parents returned a book late and had to leave her to pay the fine.  i considered her a myth.  that's 'cause we never knew anybody who actually saw ..until now.  know what that means.  we're going to get out and forget the book report.  nope, we're going to catch us a library kid.  : we'll all take an aisle.  if there really is a library kid, we'll have her cornered.  everybody got it.  okay, then move out.  any sign.  negative, teej, just a bunch of books.  who's there.  i got a visual, and she's heading towards geography.  cut her off.  she's doubling back.  if we can drive her toward the existentialists, we'll have her trapped.  there's no exit.  it's her.  hello.  we come in peace.  you eat candy.  candy good.  thank you.   you speak english.  certainly, as well as french, german, latin, greek, and basque, but i'm not fluent.  wow.  shh. please speak quietly.  remember, you're in a library.  okay, but we need answers.  for answers, please go to the reference desk.  but who are you.  i'll tell you all you want to know, but not here.  ever since i can remember, i loved books.  i read "pat the bunny" before i could walk.  by the time i was 4, i had completed the collected works of seuss and was deep into "babar" in the original french.  i could hardly wait to begin kindergarten.  i was excited at the prospect of discussing my favorite books ..  and then i saw them.  they were loud.  they were dirty.  they were my classmates.  aah.  i was afraid.  there was nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.  and then i saw it the library.  and i've been hiding behind books ever since.  kid, things have changed a great deal.  your classmates are no longer savages.  they're fourth graders now.  that may be, but this is my sanctuary now.  i'm safe and happy here.  i've got everything a kid needs.  yeah, everything but recess.  i think i read about that once.  recess isn't something you can read about.  you've got to live it.  the sun on your skin, the gravel in your shoes, the wondrous dance of the tetherball.  oh, you make it sound so beautiful.  hey, you've read the book, now experience the ride.   welcome to our world.  shh.  you don't have to whisper.  be as loud as you want.  how does one get any reading done.  this ain't book time, it's playtime.  spinelli, your grammar.  forget grammar and try this.  hmm. this must be a ball.  yes, rubber filled with air for a strong trajectory.  and look, it's inscribed.  "dizzywhiz ball, " you don't read it, you kick it.  fascinating.  this is the jungle gym.  it has a certain hyperkinetic energy which belies its stationary nature.  i like it.  who's the sculptor.  yeesh.  whoohoo.  i see.  he harnessed gravity for amusement purposes.  now you're catching on.  okay, it's your turn.  um, it's quite steep.  perhaps i should read up on technique before aah.  library kid, are you okay.  ptoo. ptoo.  do it again.  ha ha ha ha.  ha ha ha ha.   there's the bell.  recess is over.  not for me.  i'm not going in now.  i've got years of dirt to catch up on.  look, there are rules.  you can't stay on the playground all day.  i used to stay in the library all day.  boy, when that kid likes something, she really likes it.  she does display a slight tendency to overcommit.  it's not like she's out of control.  whoohoo.  library kid, be careful.  careful. ha.  ah ha ha ha ha ha.  she's gone recesscrazy.  yeeha.  we've got to stop her before she kills herself.  maybe we can coax her down with something she likes more than recess.  i don't think there's anything that kid likes better than recess.  to the library.  ha ha ha ha.  hey, library kid.  remember this. it's a book.  you used to love books.  a book, yes.  this is just what i need a decent second base.  got any round books i can use for balls.  ha ha ha ha.  gretchen: quick.  open the books.  if she hears them read aloud, perhaps it will rekindle her love of literature.  it's so crazy, it just might work.  waah. whoo.  library kid, listen.  "while the sultan of swat "is the most famous home run hitter of all time, " i didn't know babe ruth was a pitcher.  geronimo.  there she goes.  i'll be right there.  i'll be.  shoeless joe wore shoes.   "the cannons boomed as ivanovich charged, his sword held high, gleaming " ha ha ha ha.  come on.  she's getting away.  just a sec.  this is getting gory.   library kid, get down from there.  you can get in trouble, .  .  hey, tom's tricking them into painting the fence.  tender, mr. sawyer.  very tender.  wait.  see, i told you this stuff was good.  you were right.  rod mckuen charted a map of the human heart.  ooh, a golden ball.  ha ha ha ha.  come down, library kid, before you break your neck.  never.  ha ha ha ha.  whee hee hee.  don't do that.  please listen to me.  it's dangerous.  ride 'em, cowboy.  oh.  help me.  she's out of control.  in a sec.  vince, listen to me.  wait, okay.  i'm starting the chapter on hank aaron.  gretchen: spinelli, mikey, gus.  shh.  ha ha ha ha.  whoohoo. whoohoo.  aah. my glasses. i can't see.  help me. help me.   oh, my gosh.   gretchen, how dare you pull the fire alarm.  you know the fire alarm is only for fires.  but, miss finster, look.  whoa. whoa.  good sweet mike.  call the fire department.  dial 911. hurry.    thank you.  now, if you'll excuse me, i'm going back where i belong.  i know what you're thinking, and the answer is no.  i'm never leaving this library again.  this is where i belong with my safe reliable books and my orderly card catalog.  but why can't you do both.  both.  perhaps you could learn to enjoy recess without going nuts, and likewise learn how to utilize the library without moving in.  like the ancient greeks said all things in moderation.  ah, yes, the greeks.  antiquities section five, aisle four.  there's more to life than reading, just as there's more to life than just recess.  the secret is not too much or too little of either.   well, maybe.  i guess i just ii have to think about it.  i understand.  shakespeare, shakespeare, sitting in his tights, how many sonnets did he write.  ..  spinelli: it was ..  we're missing recess.  this has got to be some book report record.  will somebody shut this egghead up.  which brings us to chapter 137, in which nicolai is reunited with his beloved ninotchka.  ..  captions paid for by abc cable networks group  i'll miss you, daddy.  hope your conference goes well.  thank you, ariel.  now, i won't be back for several tides, so try and stay out of mischief, hmm.  yes. yes.  goodbye.  goodbye, everyone.  so triton will be gone for several tides, will he.  you know what they saytiming is everything.  and i'd say the time is just right for some trouble.  after all, the king didn't tell me to stay out of mischief.  and getting into mischief is what i do best.  ha ha ha ha ha.  oh, yes, she's a princess living the royal good life in the palace.  but i'm out here living in a hole like a worm.  an attractive worm, but nevertheless a worm.  i think it's time for the worm to turn.  heh heh heh heh.  i have a feeling i'm going to find something wonderful today.  and i have a sinking feeling today.  we better catch up.  who knows what she'll find or what'll find her.  i don't think i even want to think about it.  ariel, why don't we go home.  i will give you a lesson in crab philosophy.  you'll learn to say many clever things, ..
