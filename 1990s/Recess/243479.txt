 fall in.  here. now.  it has come to my attention that some of you do not take my playground punishments seriously.  you seem to think that getting in trouble is a big joke, a game.  the joke's on you because the rules of the game just changed.  discipline has a new name, and that name is the box.  any infraction of any rule will result in a trip to the box.  get caught running on the blacktop, take cuts in line, go to the box.  any horseplay, joking around, or unauthorized fun of any kind, the box.  no questions asked. got it.  good. that is all.   it's just a bunch of lines painted on the ground.  yeah, talk about lame.  it's finster's folly.  this is big, randall.  it's going to make me more famous than mildred frizbone.  mildred who.  frizbone.  the teacher who invented detention back in '52.  but, miss finster, the kids are just laughing at it.  well, they won't be laughing long, randall.  they won't be laughing long.  whoo. ha ha ha.  ha ha ha.  ha ha. whoo.  that was great.  detweiler, i might have known you'd be the first to test my new punishment.  10 minutes in the box.  t.j.'s getting the box.  the finster's box t.j.  children: . t.j.. t.j.. t.j..   have your fun while you can, detweiler, because you're not coming out for 10 minutes.  as for the rest of you, stay away.  anybody gets within 30 yards of this thing, and you'll get detention for a week.  come, randall.  detweiler alone with his thoughts.  the box big deal.  let's play a little catch.  oh, well, who cares.  i'll be out of here ..10 minutes.  i'll just watch the clouds go by.  yeah, that's it.  there's one.  nope, just a bird.  well, i wonder what time it is now.  i'll just take a little nap.  i haven't had a nice nap in a long time.   oh, man, i must have dozed off.  sure hope i'm not late for class.  no, this is crazy.  oh, this box is stupid.  just a bunch of dumb lines.  in fact, 4 dumb lines 1, 2, 3, 4.  four dumb lines.  four stupid, dumb lines painted on the ground.  they're not going to get to me.  no, sir, not to me.  mikey: he's like one of those tigers in the zoo.  maybe the box is tougher than we thought.  i hope he's going to be all right.  aah. it's getting to me.  oh.  no, no, no.  it's time to let him out, miss finster.  what do you say we give him an extra two minutes.  that's inhuman.  you're a genius, miss finster.   . this old man, he played two .  hee hee hee hee hee.  . he played knickknack on my shoe .  had enough, detweiler.  yes, t.j.'s had enough.  you may come out if you promise to be a good boy and follow my rules from now on.  oh, yes, miss finster.  t.j.'s a good little boy.  get him out of here.  t.j., you made it.  you survived.  looking good, buddy.  no. t.j.'s looking bad, but he'll be good, good, good.  oh, man, this is bad, you guys.  he's really snapped.  this is t.j.  we're talking about.  by tomorrow morning, he'll be fine.  t.j.'s a good boy, good boy.  a nice ravioli.  no.  what's wrong with him.  the ravioli is a square.  ..  the box.  aah. the box.  but he's got to eat something.  have some of my sandwich.  aah.  put it down, mikey.  it's a square.  oh.  i've got a little job for you.  help miss finster get her lunch, clean her shoes.  good boy, good boy.  eraser duty.  he's sunk as low as a kid can get.  we got to do something, guys, before we lose t.j. forever.  maybe if we just never use the word "square" again.  what are we going to do, play fourcircle.  perhaps we've been going about this all wrong.  what do you mean, gretchen.  well, freud, trying to take a person's mind off his fears is just playing into them.  the only cure is to make the person confront those fears.  must go back in the box.   .  there's no way t.j.  will go back in that box.  he's scared to death of it.  i know one way finster.  t.j.'s a good boy, stays out of trouble.  no trouble, no trouble.  i don't like this.  i don't like this one bit.  we got to do it, vince.  it's for his own good.  ready. 1, 2, 3.  hey.  t.j. detweiler.  mock me, will you.  back to the box.  no, not the box.  not the box.  are you sure this was a good idea.  it will cure him completely or push him over the edge so he'll be a blubbering mass for the rest of his life.  . this old man, he played two .  . he played knickknack on my shoe .  ooh.  hey, mister, little help.  the ball, could you throw it to me.  ugh.  dumb fourth graders think they're better than everybody else.  but but he came in the box.  he can't come in the box.  ha.  it's just four dumb lines painted on the ground.  ha ha ha.  well, randall, it seems spitball's 10 minutes are up.  what do you say we go release him.  or at least what's left of him.   hey, there, miss finster, 10 minutes already.  oh, well, yes, they are.  then i'd better get out of here.  i got a lot of playing to catch up on.  you're supposed to be a blithering jello mold.  : what, 'cause of that.  i'd have to be nuts to be afraid of that. see ya.  but my box, my brainchild, it's ruined, ruined.  he looked so sad when she took him away.  i feel like such a traitor.  why did i read that stupid freud.  hey, anybody up for a little dodgeball.  all:.  you're okay.  of course.  we thought we lost you, man.  , i'm sorry we got you into trouble.  if you hadn't done that, i'd still be pounding erasers and polishing finster's shoes.  you're not mad.  heck, no.  you guys were right.  the only way to get over your fears is to face them.  the fact is, i couldn't get out of the box until i went back in.  finster: my box.  my box. my beautiful box.   see you later, miss finster, a lot later.    incoming.  man, there is nothing like a good dirt clod war.  you can say that again.  boy: aah.  ..rock...thrown.  ..  ..make it.  what kind of rotten, evil kid woulclod war.  hey, guys, what's going on.  it was her.  spinelli did it.  ..rock.  uhoh.  that little 2bit, snotfaced, gobofspit.  i can't believe he'd say that stuff about me.  yeah, just 'cause you threw a rock at a guy.  i did not throw a rock at a guy.  throwing a rock in a dirt clod war is about as low as a kid can get.  ugh.  look, if spinelli says she didn't, she didn't.  besides, it's been a whole day.  everybody's probably forgotten about it by now.  boy: there she is, the rockthrower.  what do you want, rockthrower, to smack this poor innocent kid again.  ohh.  innocent kid. it's randall.  well, even if it is just randall, you can't throw a rock in a dirt clod war.  it's just plain wrong.  but i didn't do it.  i wasn't near the weasel.  well, where were you, then.  ii can't say.  i know where she was out getting more rocks.  take her to prickly.  turn her over to finster.  send her to the dodgeball wall.  no, wait.  i say we give her a swirly.   children: swirly. swirly. swirly.  wait a minute.  you can't give a swirly without a fair trial.  oh, yeah. says who.  says me.  as long as i'm king, we're going to do things right.  first, a fair trial, then we'll give her a swirly.  children: yay.  and to make sure the trial goes as planned, i appoint the smartest kid on the playground to be prosecutor gretchen grundler.  but i can't be the prosecutor.  ii'm spinelli's friend.  silence.  the trial will begin at noon sharp, the swirly at 12:15.  children: yay.  swirly. swirly. swirly.  what am i going to do.  it's going to be okay.  you've got gretchen for a prosecutor.  she'll go easy on you.  , according to the constitution of the playground, it is my duty to prosecute to the fullest extent of the law.  i'm doomed.  look, all you've got to do is take the stand, tell everybody what really happened, and you're home free.  i can't.  what do you mean, you can't.  i said i can't, okay.  i'm not telling what really happened.  if you don't, they'll give you the swirly for sure.  i'm not taking the stand, and that's final.  hear ye, hear ye.  the high court of the playground is now in session, the right honorable king bob presiding.  all rise.  okay, let's get this over with.  i'm missing lunch.  the prosecution may begin.  your honor, boys and girls of the jury, throwing a rock in a dirt clod war is the most despicable crime a kid can commit worse than taking cuts in line, even worse than spitting loogies in the drinking fountain.   today i intend to prove that this violent and illtempered girl sorry, spinelli is guilty, guilty, guilty.  children: yay.  the people kids call randall j. weems to the stand.   do you, randall "the snitch" weems, swear to tell the truth and nothing but the truth.  uh, i do.  randall, tell us in your own words exactly what happened yesterday.  well, this head wound's pretty bad, but i'll tell you what i remember.  it was a dirt clod war to end all dirt clod wars.  like always, i was pretty much having to fight the whole thing singlehanded.   and then i saw her.  ha ha. gotcha, wimpos.   of all the cowardly acts.  spinelli.  randall.  it's just you and me, sister.  ii can't fight you, randall.  you are my moral and physical superior.  you're right, spinelli.  it wouldn't be fair.  after all, i can beat you any day at throwing dirt clods.  true, randall, butthisis not a dirt clod.  you wouldn't.  just watch me.  i say we give her the swirly now.  children: swirly. swirly. swirly.  just because randall says spinelli did it doesn't mean it's true.  yeah, why would spinelli want to hit randall with a rock.  yes, why.  what possible motive would miss spinelli have for beaning this innocent boy.  you don't have anything against my client, do you, spinelli.  not enough to hit him with a rock.  oh, really.  i call mikey to the stand.  me.  mikey, did you tell me about something you saw yesterday.  i'm sorry, spinelli, but i saw it.  i saw it all.  it was a nightmare of a dirt clod war.  i had never seen such carnage.  madness. madness.  but then i saw spinelli, and my heart felt hope for mankind.  you okay, man.  get me a tissue.  i said get me a tissue now.  timeout. timeout.  ha ha ha.  . i got spinelli .  . i got spinelli .  i'm going to cream you, you little worm.  you hit spinelli during a timeout.  she was right.  you are a worm.  your honor, please, my client's not the one on trial here.  i was afraid spinelli was going to do something she'd regret, so i chased after them.   i saw them on the other side of the fence.  okay, okay, i give.  please, don't bean me.  spinelli, don't.  i ran for the gate, ..   it was too late, too late.  it's okay, mikey.  it's okay.  when will you people learn.  war is not a game.  it's not a game.  i thought it was a game.  boys and girls of the jury, the facts of the case are clear.  provoked or not, the defendant attacked my client and beaned him with a rock, and your verdict must be as simple guilty, boys and girls.  guilty.  children: guilty. guilty.  does the defense have anything to say before we sentence your client to a swirly.  yes, your honor, we do.  there's only one defense against charges as heinous as these, and that defense is the truth.  that is why we call spinelli to the stand.  i told you guys i'm not talking.  this isn't just about you anymore, this is about all of us.  he's right.  letting people punish you for something you didn't do is plain wrong.  if you let people give you a swirly you don't deserve, then you're just as wrong as they are.  oh, man, t.j.  why do i let you talk me into these things.  okay, spinelli, tell us what really happened.  well, it was like this.  there i was standing over randall, him begging for forgiveness and me with a dirt clod in my hand not a rock, a dirt clod.  i was going to nail him when i heard a sound from above me.   it was some stupid cat stuck in a tree.  i figured i had to help it, so i just forgot all about that idiot randall and did what i had to do.  come on, boy.  come on.  you mean, you're, like, saying you didn't bean randall 'cause you were saving a kitty from a tree.  yes.   i should have just taken the swirly.  this is, like, so not true.  spinelli saving a kitty. as if.  you can ask miss finster if you don't believe me.  what does she have to do with it.  well, you're not going ..  conan.  oh, my little babywaby.  did mommy lose you.  good work, spinelli.  i owe you one.  turned out the dumb cat was finster's all along.  so there's your proof, okay.  i wasn't near randall when he got hit by that rock.  if you were getting finster's cat out of the tree, who threw the rock.  yeah, what's the truth.  why is everyone looking at me.  i'm not the one on trial, right, gretchen.  i, too, would like to hear the truth for a change.  the truth.  you can't handle the truth.  try us.  okay, you want the truth.  well, here it is.  all those years of snitching for finster, running around for finster, being finster's slave, and never once have i ever got a "good job, randall.  " and then little miss spinderell comes along and gets that stupid cat out of a tree, and it's, "good job, spinelli.  " those words will burn in my soul forever.  but who threw the rock, randall.  who threw the rock.  i did it, okay. it was me.  there i was, watching miss finster compliment my archnemesis spinelli.  it sickened me.  and that's when i saw it that beautiful rock just lying there on the ground.  so i picked it up.  i realized how heavy it was and found another, and i threw it.  i threw it straight up in the air.  i hit myself on the head, okay.  and i'd do it again.  i'd do it again.  oh, finster, my finster, how you torture me.  what an idiot.  that's the lamest thing i ever heard.  in light of this new evidence, the prosecution withdraws its case.  children: yay.  which means this court has only one other official duty give randall the swirly.  aah.  well, spinelli, i told you we were your dream team.  yeah, sorry we didn't believe you at first.  it's just i thought i saw what i thought i saw.  hey, don't worry about it.  i was the one who wouldn't take the stand.  you were all there when i needed you even you, gretchen.  hey, what are friends for.  how could we ever have doubted her.  randall: aah.  children: swirly. swirly. swirly.  captions by vitaccaptions paid for by abc cable networks group coming through.  come on.  come on over here.   ha ha. hoo hoo hoo.  ahha.  i got him.  huh.  nice move.   pass it to me. over here.  coming through. look out.  splash it to me, ariel.  over here. come on.  over here. over here.  hoo hoo hoo hoo.  ooh.  ooh ha ha hoo hoo.  hey, flounder, i'm open.  go deep.  watch it.  aah.   do do do do    do do do do   look out.  watch out.  you have to move pretty fast to play sponge ball.  i'm in too big a hurry toaah.  good morning.  dudley, what took you so long.  did you finish the calculations.  ..yes...  ..  oh, then it's true.  the red tideiscoming.  swim. swim.  help. help.  uh, it's, uhpoisonous, deadly to all marine life.  we better investigate, dudley.  we don't want to start a panic in atlantica.  ..  ..   everything you know i know    you know i know, you know, mon    everything you know i know   especially anyone who has a tendency to blab.   everything you know i know    you know i know, you know, mon   heh heh.  that tickles.   everything you know i know    you know i know, you know, mon   oh, mon.  ah, good morning, your majesty.  i heard the most interesting gossip today.  ..  not now, sebastian. i have to go somewhere.  i'll go with you.  i'll be there to advise you on anything that comes up.  that won't be necessary.  aah.  why don't you take some time off.  me. off.  oh, no, i don't have any vacation time coming.  that trip to barbados last summer ate up my vacation days for three years.   everything you know i know    you know i know, you know, mon    everything you know i know    you know i know you know, mon   ooh.  ..  like, uh, the doctor.  no. i'm in perfect health, sire.  watch this.  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ..  the, uh, dentist.  just had the checkup. no cavities, mon.  i intend to stay by your side.  you don't understand, sebastian.  i don't need you today.  ..  i don't understand.  there are certain matters of court that are secret.  secret from me, your most trusted advisor.  yes, well, even a trusted advisor must take orders, and i am ordering you to stay here.  ..  oh, my, the king don't trust me anymore. ) )
