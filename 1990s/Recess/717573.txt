fates.  how they torment thee.  it's not so bad.  i used to lose my glasses all the time, but i've gotten better at keeping them on.  perhaps the bone structure of your face has matured.  my dad took to taping my glasses behind my ears.  same old gus.  hey, coolster, when did you get here.  who, me.  7:58 this morning.  ha ha. good one, dude.  you're new here.  i'm the man who can get you an audience with king bob.  but i don't need to see king bob.  yeah, right.  you kill me. later.  that was weird.  jordan thought gus was someone else.  someone cool.  like a coolster in a record store.  oh, you guys are talking crazy.  tip number one, okay.  do not hang out with these losers.  they're, like, so nowhere.  what's that, barrette brain.  just explaining something to the new boy.  he's too cool to hang out with you dorks.  toodles.  , but what's she doing talking to me.  without his glasses, kids think gus looks cool.  cool. really.  come to hanky.  come on.  i got 'em.  there you go, gus.  now, remember, son, on your face or in your case.  yes, sir.  there's our gus.  who's up for some kickball.  i got floor junk on my glasses.  i got to wash them.  hey, groovy guy.  hmm.  ..groovy guy.  ..groovy guy.  man: private gus, what are you still doing up.  lights out was 10 minutes ago.  i'm working on something ..  and my name's not gus.  he wasn't at the bus stop.  he wasn't at the bike racks, either.  this isn't like gus.  where is he, anyway.  guys, you're not going to believe it.  gus: what up.  all: huh.  yo.  catch you later.  like, who's the rebel.  whaa.  where are your glasses, boyo.  right here in my pocket.  don't you think you should put them on like hank said.  unhunh.  with my glasses on, i'm just your guys' tagalong pal, but with them off, heck, i'm cool.  hey there, cool kid.  later, cool kid.  stop by the swings at recess, cool kid.  we'll, you know, swing.  see what i mean.  these stupid glasses have been keeping me from achieving my cool potential, but not anymore.  what are you going to do, only wear glasses in class.  nope, i'm going to do this.  hasta la vista,babies.  wow, he roofed them.  you think that was such a good idea, gus.  not "gus," teej.  from now on, " i'm all right, i'm all right.  you going to be okay, gus i mean, guy.  oh, yeah, i'm going to be fine.  excuse me, pardon me.   uh, guy, i don't believe the trash can is your proper seat assignment.  well, no, it's not.  i just thought way to be a rebel, man.  fight the power.  tomorrow, i'm sitting on the globe.  ohh.   good morning, partners in learning.  i trust you all had a branintensive breakfast ..  the green mints.  that guy is so scandalous.  hello, ladies.  shall i take him to the dodgeball wall, my liege.  no, leave him be.  you don't mess with a kid that cool.  i'll have some of that and a little bit of that and a whole lot of that on top.  i wonder if gus knows ..  or that his spaghetti is covered with ice cream.  even i wouldn't eat that, unless i was really hungry.  what do you call that mess of stuff, guy.  well, uh, i guess it's kind of . fusion cuisine, the latest taste sensation .  but of course.  whoa.  um, guy, i don't think this whole no glasses thing is working out.  things are going great.  just wait till kickball.  the way my luck's going, i could be picked first.  the way your luck's going, you could break your leg.  guy, incoming.  i got it, i got it.  gus, gus, are you okay.  it'sguy.  that's the fifth time you've been hit.  only five.  i like coolness as much as the next guy, but don't you think this has gone on long enough.  repeated kickball impact to the head can result in serious neurological problems.  it could all be avoided by putting your glasses back on now.  you guys don't get it.  by not wearing my glasses, i look good, and when you look good, you feel good.  ow.  feelin' good.  i'm really worried about that guy.  and i say we got to protect him from himself.  what are we going to do, run around behind the doofus and make sure he doesn't keep getting creamed.   i'm okay.  anybody got any better ideas.   gus: my foot.  guy, any tips for a plain normal kid like me.  lose the uniform, philly.  it's not you.  say, guy, where'd you get that sharplooking hairdo.  barbershop, second saturday of each month be there or be square.  miss grotke: everyone settle, please.  i'm handing back tuesday's assignment on greek myths.  greek myths.  i thought we were writing about green mints.  hey, gretch, can you make out what i got on this thing.  certainly, guy.  whompin' bobula.  , we have a situation code red.  code red.     : hey, gus.  , i thought that might be you.  most kids call me "guy" now.  most kids don't care if you ..  or impale yourself on the flagpole.  or walk into the girl's bathroom.  are we back to this.  listen, guys, what's a bruise or a cut or a sour stomach if kids think i'm cool.  there's nothing cool about failing grades.  i don't know what you're talking about.  oh, yeah.  then what's this.  hey, give me back my paper on the green mints.  i worked really hard on that.  it's an "f," gus.  it is. huh.  i thought it was a cplus.  oh, well.  an "f" is a cry for help.  you've got to go back to wearing your glasses.  no.  you guys don't understand.  you haven't lived a single day as gus "four eyes" griswold, but i have.  i've lived dozens of them.  there's always someone more cooler than him, more popular, more with it, always someone who gets picked before him, but lousy stuff like that never happens to guy griswold, and it never will.  so if guy's who the people want, guy's who the people are going to get.  but, gus, as the bard once wrote, " yeah, and your own self needs glasses.  not anymore.  those glasses are history.  i'm not wearing them, and you can't make me.  safety man, you supposed to be walking me home now, 'member.  huh. oh, yeah.  come on, hector.  let's get out of here.  safety man, why you no wear you glasses.  you look funny.  it's a bigkid thing, hector.  you're too young to understand.  safety man, you okay.  yeah, yeah, sure.  i don't hear any cars coming.  let's go.   you kids ought to be more careful.  safety man, we almost got hitted. you no see car.  ii'm sorry, hector.  you yell at friends.  you cross street with no look.  you no safety man.  you scary danger man.  no, no, hector.  i'm still me, honest.  it's just without my glasses, i'm cool.  see.  when you have glasses, you safety man, the coolest kid i know.  when you no have glasses, you scary danger man, and he not cool at all.  but, hector make up your mind.  who you want to be. who.  what are you doing.  waiting for guy.  i'm going to get him to sign my shovel.  yeah, but there's an animal on the roof.   maybe those rumors of an evil chimney troll are true.  who is that kid.  he moves around like circus folk.  a kid on the roof that is so cool.  it is i, gus griswold, and i can see again.   just him. big deal.  nothing cool about the roof.  it's good to see you seeing again, gus.  your spectacles become you.  get down from there, griswold.  yes, ma'am.  i'll just, uh, head down this actually, ma'am, i think i'm stuck.  guy might have been a good climber, but gus is scared.   randall, go get hank.  tell him to bring the big ladder.  help.  help.  that's my safety man.   captions paid for by abc cable networks group hi,
