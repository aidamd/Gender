 spinelli: we need a pitcher, not a belly itcher.  hey, watch the windows.  kids and their infernal balls.  first middle school offer i get, i am out of here.  sir, principal prickly on the phone for you.  that's ridiculous.  i'm principal prickly.  i can't be ..  paul, is that you.  petey, little brother, how's the secondbest elementary principal in town.  i don't know, paul.  you'll have to look in the mirror and ask.  i see your rapier wit hasn't lost its edge.  i'm going to be up your way tomorrow and thought i might pop by for a visit.  visit to the school tomorrow.  that a problem, halfpint.  why should i have a problem with a friendly visit from my older brother who just loves making me feel inferior.  no, no problem at all.  we're in shipshape around here.  see you tomorrow.  miss lemon.  we've only got 24 hours to get this school shipshape.  coming through, missy.  what the hey, that was my ball.  heads up.  towels, gentlemen.  cologne. breath mints.  talk about your close shave.  cheese it. he's here.  paulie.  petey.  so this is it, huh.  nice flagpole.  of course, mine's bigger.  well, let me show you around the school.  after you.  sounds like the title of your life story.  well, petey, i have to say your cafeteria serves a pretty good filet mignon.  that's nothing.  if i'd had more notice too bad your cook grilled every ounce of flavor out.  did i mention the chef at my school graduated from the cordon bleu.  86 the crme brle.  let's stroll the grounds, shall we.  oh, man, last inning and we're a run behind.  and gus is up.  no problem.  who's playing third base.  ah, yes, tracy "too deep" logan.  don't worry.  i have a plan.  the third baseman has a tendency to play deep.  beat out a little roller down the line.  in other words, bunt left.  got it.  my word, little brother, you keep your school grounds looking immaculate.  i can't take all the credit.  our janitor has shown great facility in executing my vision.  excuse me just one second.  get off the grass.  it's rented.  my, these kids are impressive little athletes.  i mean, don't i know it.  last week scouts from lincoln middle school were here recruiting.  the coach at washington high offered me a car to get dibs on some of my youngsters.  a graduate of mine went on to play professional kickball in japan.  perhaps a wager is in order.  what did you have in mind.  the losing brother has to wash the winner's car.  in front of the loser's school.  wearing a bathing suit.  during recess.  gutsy, petey. i accept.  bring your kids to my school, and we'll see who fields the best kickball team.  what just happened here.  i'd say we're stuck between a rock and his older brother.  oh, man, this is sweet, getting out of school in the middle of the day to play kickball.  yeah, and look at these uniforms.  boy, this is going to be fun.  okay, children, when you're out there playing today, never lose sight of the fact that you represent your school and, more importantly, me.  play the best game of your young lives.  beat the other team.  humiliate them. crush them.  win, i tell you, win.  and, uh, oh, yeah, have fun.  polish those floors, replace those light bulbs, clean those windows, and that fresco artist is laying down on the job.  principal prickly, the new flagpole is here.  the 50footer.  excellent.  it's beautiful.  well, look who's here.  petey.  paulie.  come on, halfpint, you've got a game to lose.  i think a flagpole that large is unseemly.  you know, guys, something about this place seems kind of familiar.  it's the stink from the cafeteria.  they serve the same industrial slop coast to coast.  i've given the kids the day off so they can see their schoolmates triumph in the big kickball game.  don't you think you're overconfident.  hmm, let me think about that.  no.  i still say there's something fishy about this place.  i just can't figure out what.  hey, we're digging here.  no kids in the hole without a helmet.  .  welcome, students, faculty, lambs to the slaughter.  even though today's game is a competition, the other, lesstalented principal prickly and i wanted to remind you that no matter what the outcome, everybody will be ..  except you losers.  you're never going to believe what i saw.  calm down.  you've got pregame jitters.  take deep breaths.  you'll be fine.  if that doesn't work, put a lid on it.  i'm trying to get into my zone.  but, but now i'd like you to give it up for the home team.  at second base regalli.  at shortstop vance.  it can't be.  in the outfield greta grobler.  also in the outfield russ rimple.  it's happening.  at first base mickey.  they're, like, our doubles.  the correct term is doppelganger.  we have met the enemy, and he is us.  oh, come on.  that's crazy talk, guys.  sure, there's some similarities, but it's not like we're playing our clones.  and finally, our pitcher and team captain c.j. rottweiler.  all: c.j. rottweiler.  i'm scared, t.j.  i want to go home.  this can't be as bad as it looks, right.  batter up.  we want a kicker, not a nostril picker.  shut up or you're dead meat.  are you going to make me, punk.  with pleasure.  when i get through with you, you'll be able to sit next to yourself.  come on, you monkeys, play ball.  definitely vincelike.  no fair.  that kid's really, really big.  come on, vince.  timeout, please.  what are they doing.  a strategic maneuver.  it'll never work.  home team is looking good, eh, halfpint.  i'm not a halfpint.  i'm a full pint.  they might have stopped us, but we can stop them, too.  i'm going to go give the troops a few words of encouragement.  listen here, you little slackers, i didn't spring for those uniforms for nothing.  my reputation is riding on this game.  get out there and score some runs.  but we're not up right now.  then score when you are, or you'll all be looking at a quiz tomorrow.  and if you don't score some runs, you'll all be looking at a quiz tomorrow.  great bunch of kids.  these guys might be as athletic as we are, they might have a principal who's as big a jerk as ours is, but they don't have the same heart, right.  all: right.  they don't have the same heart, right.  all: right.  batter up.  we need a kick.  kid, the whole game is on your shoulders.  make a mistake and it's another year of fourth grade.  hey, you, if that kick comes your way, catch it or it's two more years of fourth grade.  strike.  you can't call that a strike.  it was too bouncy.  maybe you're right.  ball one.  you can't change a call like that.  he can so.  stay out of this.  and let you browbeat the ump.  are you calling me a cheater.  are you talking to me.  guys, i'm going in.  what's going on out there.  i think they're negotiating.  cheater, cheater, pumpkin eater.  i'm not listening, i'm not listening.  we have an announcement to make.  we've agreed to a draw.  you can't do that.  you kids get back out there and play.  sorry, principal pricklys, but we're not listening to you anymore.  we never thought anybody could suck the fun out of kickball, but this has not been fun.  it's not whether you win or lose.  it's getting out of school to play the game.  come on, guys, let's go.  you kids can't do this to me.  you set this up.  you're the one who's always cheating, like when we used to play chinese checkers.  who used to steal from the bank during oligopoly.  you never let me be the race car.  don't bump me.  you bumped me.  adults.  want to play on our jungle gym.  we call it old crusty.  we call ours old rusty.  pee wee pals an idea whose time has come.  for one week, fourth grade big trees have an opportunity to interact oneonone with the kindergarten saplings, playing, sharing, learning, and caring during recess.   here to explain more is the architect of the pee wee pals pilot program, our own kindergarten teacher mrs. clemperer.  they all just sit there quietly, waiting.  it's beautiful.  mrs. clemperer.  huh. oh, yeah.  i came up with this pee wee pals thing to help the little ones prepare for the challenge ..  and buy me a little peace and quiet.  that's all fine and good, but what's in it for us.  each of you big trees will take away a sense of responsibility, a deeper understanding of his/herself, and a better idea of how ..  oh, and two tickets to gonzo world water park and arcade.  now, are there

that.  it's gonzo world, guys.  haven't you seen the commercials.  they got huge water slides 100 feet tall, pounding rock music piped in the pools, six types of corn dogs, and the eviscerator, flume of doom.  i'm going down and getting my ticket to gonzo world.  t.j.'s right.  no munchkin's keeping me from tasting the spray of the world's most outrageous water park.  i must admit i'm intrigued by the physics of the eviscerator.  corn dogs.  okay, this is going to be cake.  all we got to do is keep asking ourselves, "  kid, what do you do for fun.  spencer eat paper.  i'm full from breakfast.
