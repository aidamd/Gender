component of all tiny little guy.  gee, i don't know, honey.  this whole thing seems so sudden.  shouldn't we tell gus.  and ruin the big surprise.  not on your life.  but is this something you should surprise a child with, especially a child like gus.  oh, now, gus may seem overly sensitive, but inside he's one tough little soldier.  well, if you really think so, dear.  i know so.  wednesday night at 1900 we begin operation relocation.  relocation.  what are we looking at.  i don't know, but did you ever notice the school has a big clock on it.  oh, i knew it couldn't last forever.  what couldn't last forever.  this, all of it the school, the playground, my friends.  gus, do you have some unpleasant information we nonmilitary types aren't privy to.  no, it's nothing like that.  it's just that i'm moving away.  moving.  but you just got here.  tell me about it.  i overheard mom and dad talking.  it's definite.  oh, man, that whomps.  it's like a nightmare.  i've been to 12 schools in the last 6 years, but i thought just once i'd found one i'd get to stay at.  i guess i was wrong.  when's it going down, gus.  tomorrow night.  but you'll miss next week's field trip.  believe me, that's not all i'm going to miss.  i heard the news, and it rots. fish stick.  thanks.  i'll treasure it always.  i really hate to see you leave, gus.  now i'll be the last one picked for kickball.  thanks for being there for me, man.  ..   this is sad, so sad.  it's not like gus is dying or anything.  we'll still see him around.  , the odds of encountering a kid after a major family migration are low, very low indeed.  i'll never see him again.  look on the bright side, mikey.  there is a 2% margin of error.  i'm not going to do it.  i'm not going to leave the coolest school i've ever went to.  i'm not going to leave the best friends i've ever had.  no, sir.  i'm staying right here.  but, gus, if your mom and dad are moving, you got to go.  the days of old pusharound gus are over.  i am the master of my own fate.  i have free will.  i hereby proclaim by all that is fun that gus griswold has moved away for the very last time.   hey, i like it.  what's your plan.  i have no idea.  anybody seen gus.  he wasn't on the bus.  the crossing guards didn't see him, either.  maybe the little jarhead's already gone.  oh, man, you guys got to check this out.  morning, guys.  how do you like my new place.  what are you talking about.  gus griswold is officially awol.  this morning i packed up my stuff, ran away from home, and moved into the jungle gym.  you can't live in the jungle gym.  it's close to school, you guys, and where else can a kid get tetherball on demand.  he'd have fewer tardies on his next report card.  well, it is roomy.  you get lots of sunshine.   there's the bell.  coming, gus.  i've got to work on my new pad.  now, where can this go.  and then our hero beowulf rips grendel's arm off and beats him with it a striking metaphor for man's cruel treatment of endangered species.  yeow. ouch. ouch.  ouch. ouch. ouch.  hey, vince, check it out.  step aside, junior.  the fixit folk are here.  what do you mean.  your place needs something more.  like what.  oh, walls.  maybe we could get crates to use as chairs.  maybe some wingerdingers for when you get hungry.  and some comic books for reading material.  you guys are thinking way too small.  what we need is electricity.   let there be light.   well, well, well, isn't this cozy.  what are you facial freaks doing here.  you can't just, like, take over the jungle gym.  why not.  this is gus' home now.  oh, it is, is it.  we'll see what miss finster has to say.  why, you little now, now, spinelli.  if that's what these ladies must do, so be it.  it's a shame, since gus was hoping they might apply their talent and taste to decorating the place.  did you say decorating.  yeah, but quiet, detweiler.  we're busy making magic happen.  visualize, girls, visualize.  i'm, like, thinking jungle motif.  we'll need some bamboo, plants, some animal prints.  you mean like a poster of dogs playing poker.  you have no eye.  wait outside.  that was smooth, teej, velvety smooth.  nice digs, guster, but where's your conversation pit.  my what.  a little sunken space where you can rap.  i don't have one.  say no more.  my friend, an anonymous but very generous soul has donated this wonderful chair to the cause.  yeah, we found it in a dumpster.    party at gus' place.  password.  how about "fat lip".  works for me.   man, this place is really rocking.  yeah, but where's gus.  hey, cats and kittens, join the fun.  gus.  that's me, big guy.  now get ready to party griswoldstyle.  left hand, mauve.   so then i say to him, "that's no test tube.  " how come you guys never talked to me before.  you never had your own place before.  cookie dough, anyone.  cookie dough.   you guys leaving already.  we were just going to make marshmallow sandwiches and play air guitar.  you're a swinger, gus, but i've got to go.  my dad promised to play catch with me.  oh, yeah, i forgot.  you guys still live with your folks.  this is the life, eh.  no more bedtime, no more moving from state to state, and no more saying goodbye to best buddies.  goodbye, buddy.  what.  i've got to get home before the streetlights go on.  this place really swings at night.  how do you know.  the grister's in the house fun, fun, fun.  i've got to get out.  me, too.  ditto.  but but you're a brave kid, gus.  i'd never have the guts to stay out all night.  brave guy. yeah, me that.  hey, teej, i've got some great board games.  stick around and let me cream you at rat trap.  i've got to get going, too.  gus, you sure you're going to be okay.  me. you kidding. no problem.  i'll be more than fine.  hurry on home to mommy now.  i'll catch you in the a.m., bro.  they all want to leave. fine.  i don't need them.  i'll just settle down with a good comic book.  ah,"seorfusion" 214 a ripping yarn, if memory serves.   hmm, xray glasses these would be a distinct advantage. aah.  you're going to be fine, gus, just fine.  uhoh.   ..  nothing to be scared of.    it's just the wind.  a little wind can't hurt anybody.  aah.  why did i ever run away from home, why did i leave my mom and dad.  i'll be dead and frozen soon, and they'll never even know i loved them.  i got to get home.  i just got to.   aah.  aah.  i'm scared.  okay, one page of"seorfusion" followed by one math problem.   hello.  oh, hi, mrs. griswold.  no, we haven't seen gus.  oh, i'm sure he's okay.  oh, please don't cry, mrs. griswold.  home, got to get home.    aah.  please don't kill me.  i'm too young to die.  gus. i got him, madge.  dad.  thank goodness we found you.  i had you listed as missing in action.  oh, gus, gus, you're safe.  mom, i thought i'd never see you again.  what were you doing here.  i was running away from home.  running away. but why.  i heard you guys talking about operation relocation, and, well, i just can't move again.  i just can't.  we're not going to move.  we were just going to transfer you from the little bedroom into my map room.  you're just putting me in a bigger bedroom in the same house.  of course, honey.  we would never move without telling you first.  you wouldn't.  heck, no.  you're the most important soldier in this man's army.  gee, thanks, dad.  come on, let's go home.  i'll make you a nice hot cup of cocoa.  could we put marshmallows in it.  sure, honey.  thanks, mom.  there's only one thing i don't understand.  how'd you know where to find me.  well, let's put it this way.  gus, you've got one heck of a platoon leader.  captions paid for by abc cable networks group ohh.  grrr.  hee hee hee.
