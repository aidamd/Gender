get into a class "a" scuffle.  makes you wish you'd been there, don't it.  got in a fight, do you.  didn't confess to any misdoings, all evidence clearly suggests a physical altercation.  maybe he finally gave that bigmouth lawson what's been coming to him.  perhaps he was defending one of the little people, a downtrodden soul who needed his help.  vince:well, whatever it was he did, risked his life doing it.  gus:wow, what a guy.  he's a hero, and he doesn't even want anyone to know.  so, detweiler doesn't want anyone to know, eh.  well, i'll just see what i can do about that.

hey, there, bob.  silence.  on your knees.  but, king bob, this is all a big mistake.  hand me my royal staff.  something tells me our hero's journey just came to an end.  but i can explain.  after you quelled that kindergarten uprising.  what's to explain.  in the name of all royalty everywhere, i knight you sir t.j. the brave.   and i further decree that tomorrow shall be known as detweiler day.   and what a day it will be.  you seem to have had a change of heart about that black eye.  you seem almost proud.  it took a while for me to accept myself for who i am.  bye, mom. bye, dad.  hmm, not bad, not bad at all.    thank you, thank you.  kids of the playground, we gather today to celebrate detweiler day, a day honoring this hero kid.  let us begin by showering him with our thanks in the form of stuff.  what are you waiting for.  bring on the gifts.  announcing sam and dave, the diggers.  we present to you the coolest thing we ever dug up a bicentennial quarter.  whoa, that's from the '70s.  announcing the hustler kid.  check it out a genuine swisscrafted beanie mcchimp pocket watch, made in china.  cool.  announcing the guru kid.  oh, mighty hero, it is only befitting that a manchild as enlightened as you have the crown of rags, symbolizing your great inner strength and courage.  uh, thanks.  i'll wear it later.  corn chip girl.  don't tell me.  you're giving me corn chips.  not all of them, sir, just my most cherished chip.  see, it's in the shape of abraham lincoln.  gee, thanks.  i'll make sure to put it in a special place, like in my mouth.  , you shall regale us with your story.  my story.  the story of how you became a hero, from start to finish.  don't leave out any details.  well, okay, sure.  um, it all started with a call from the pentagon.  yeah, that's it, the pentagon, and man:theodore.  huh. what.  who said that.  in your hand.  honest abe.  don't you think this lie has gone on long enough.  but, abe, they're throwing me a day here.  i didn't get my own day by telling lies.  who's he talking to.  i have no idea.  , sometimes letting people think something is true is just as bad as lying in the first place.  you didn't mean to let this story get out of hand, but if you don't put things straight, you'll live with it for the rest of your life.  tell the truth, son.  it's the only way.  yeah, i guess you're right.  corn chip girl, i cannot accept this corn chip.   in fact, i can't accept any of these gifts, because the thing is, i'm not a hero.  i guess you could even say i'm a coward.  stories have been going around about this black eye, but i haven't had the guts to tell anyone the truth.  see, there's this youth group my mom signed me up for, and last weekend ..the big hoedown.  lucky us, we all got to learn to square
