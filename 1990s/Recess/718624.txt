 i can't keep my mind off speedy.  i keep thinking about how he used to run all day.  he used to tickle my face with his whiskers.  he used to zip through my maze without getting lost.  i kept trying to tell myself he was just a hunk of dna, but who am i kidding.  speedy was special.  he was a hamster.  go to the pet store.  they got a million of them.  they're all the same.  maybe to you, spinelli, but to me he was special.  he was my friend, and ii killed him.  i pushed him too hard with that squeaky carrot.  oh, come on, mikey.  it wasn't your fault.  i gave him that stupid distilled water.  no, it was those garlic croutons.  n't take so much seasoning.  if it makes you feel better, you all killed him, okay.  it was nobody's fault.  it was just his time to go.  i know.  i wish i could have said goodbye to the little guy.  too late now.  says who.  it seems pretty obvious, t.j.  hey, it's never too late to say goodbye.  speedy was our good friend.  i say we give him a funeral.

just got wrecked.  sorry, guys.  we're booked solid.  we got a bomb shelter for that new science teacher.  but this is for speedy.  the hamster.  why didn't you say so.  speedy was a great digger.  we'd be honored.  a funeral for a hamster.  well, i do need a new dress.  something black.  plus a hat with a veil.  i'll get a scarf.  and shoes.  and matching bags.  this is the best plot in the playground.  something like this would set you back, but because it's for speedy, you can have my allinone burial package at a mere 2 bucks over cost.  you got yourself a deal.  i'm not coughing up my milk money to bury a hairball.  it's for speedy.  what do you kids think you're doing.  whoops. got to go.  hey, king bob, your highness.  ..  digging a hole.  digging a hole in sixth grade territory.  take them to the dodge ball wall.  you don't understand, your majesty.  we're having a funeral for speedy.  for speedy the hamster.  i didn't even know he was sick.  why, when i was a mere fourth grader like yourselves, i used to talk to speedy and tell him my hopes and dreams.  of course you can bury speedy here.  in fact, i, king bob, will give the eulogy.  what is with you people.  have you all gone insane.  it's a hamster a dumb, little, insignificant $2.58 hamster.  what's eating her.  how could one hamster have so many friends.  kids of the playground, we are gathered here today to say goodbye to speedy.  speedy was more than a hamster.  he was a friend.  hey, are we late.  ..  captain of the high school football team.  me and the guys came as soon as we heard.  we knew speedy in the fourth grade.  he used to be like a mascot to us.   okay, fine.  stand over there.  way over there.  anyway, for some of us, speedy was a friend, for others, a mascot.   so, did we miss anything.  you bus drivers knew speedy, too.  back in fourth grade, we played with speedy more than we played with cars.  just stand over there with the big blubbering guy.  anyway, like i was saying, a friend, a mascot, a playmate speedy was all of this and more.  in fact  i've come to pay my respects to a great hamster.  mayor fitzhugh, you knew speedy.  i owe everything to this little guy.  back when i was a fourth grader, this little hamster was my only friend.  he never laughed at my hes, at my dreams.  he just ran round in his little wheel, telling me in his silent way, "keep moving, fitzhugh.  keep moving, " thanks, speedy.  i'll never forget you.  that's more than 40 years ago.  anyway, like i've been trying to say, friend, mascot, playmate, soul mate, speedy meant a bunch of stuff to a lot of us, and, well ah, heck, just bury the little fluff ball.   no. take me, too.  good sweet mike.  spinelli, what are you doing.  i loved the little rat, okay.  i loved everything his nose, his paws.  i'll never forget the first day he looked up at me with those eyes, and i saw love.  that's right, love.  i'll never love another hamster again.  leave us alone.  speedy. speedy.  speedy.  hey, did speedy always have a spot under his chin.  spot under his chin.  speedy had a stripe down his back.  speedy had white paws like running shoes.  running shoes.  speedy was brown from head to toe.  hey, this one's female.  the one in the picture is a girl, but the speedy i always knew was a boy.  they're not the same hamster.  bbut how can this be.  miss grotke: perhaps i can explain.  miss grotke.  you see, the average hamster only hangs out on this planet for a couple of years, and we teachers weren't sure if you kids could handle the metaphysical ramifications of, you know, death.  what are you trying to say, miss grotke.  well, it's like this from the day this school was built, every fourth grade class has had a hamster named speedy, and whenever one died, we teachers would secretly replace it with a new one before you found out.  you mean you lied to us.  "lie" is a harsh word.  i prefer to say we massaged reality.  that explains it.  to have known these people, speedy would have to have been alive for decades.  this isn't my speedy.  or mine.  or mine.  come on, guys, let's go.  wait.  don't try and stop us.  we could become an ugly mob.  now hold on.  you're acting like babies.   i am not.  i want my speedy.  look, maybe this speedy wasn't your speedy or yours or mine.  the fact is, every speedy was a speedy to somebody.  just because there's more than one doesn't change how any of us felt.  it doesn't change what they taught us, either how to make a bed out of wood chips, how to enjoy even the stalest bread, how fun it can be to run in circles, and most important, how to be a friend.  we gathered here today to honor a great hamster, only now we get to honor a lot of great hamsters, not just my speedy, but yours and yours.  so what do you say.  let's do this thing right for speedy.  i hereby declare this the tomb of the unknown speedy.  all: yay.  speedy, we hardly knew ye.   yeah. way to go.  ha ha ha.  ha ha.  ha ha.  captions by vitaccaptions paid for by abc cable networks group 8, 9, 10.  ..   over here.  aha.  oof.  if you let me go, i could help.  why would we need help watching a turtle race.  they go slow. it's hard to miss anything.  ha ha ha.  all right. you may come.  all right.  hee hee hee.  aha.  i told you i'd find you, ariel.  ..ariel.  flounder, i'm over here.  peekabooboo.  ahh.  sorry, daddy, we were just playing.  yeah.  we didn't know you were playing, too.  it's all right.  what would atlantica be without fun and games, and art and music.  you are so right, your majesty.  atlantica is more harmonious than a full crustacean band.  we're gone till dark.  you two stay out of trouble.  we'll trywe will, your majesty.  have fun, daddy.  what do you want to do now.  i knew it.  it knew it would be something scary.  it's beautiful.  must have come from up there.  there's another one.  hello.  is somebody there.  where did that come from.  here. up here.  it came from the volcano.  a talking volcano.  ah.  what is it.  please get me out.  i've been trapped in here for so long.  maybe i can pull you out.  no. don't you know.  the story of the horrible creature merpeople locked in a mountain.  you mean the story that if the monster gets out, atlantica will be doomed.  i don't know.  i plug my ears before mom finishes telling it.  that's a story grownups tell to scare little fishes.  it works.  this poor little thing needs help.  i'm going to get him out.  stand back.  ..ugh...ugh.  yes, that's it.  ahh.  help.  i knew it.  i knew it.  this is impossible.  ha ha ha.  ah ha ha ha.  thank you.  you're very kind.  ha ha ha. ) )
