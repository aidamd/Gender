  what a crummy winter.  how's my tan line.  what are you doing.  it's going to be a white christmas.  white christmas.  get real, man.  we haven't had snow since i was in preschool.  it's all about faith, kids.  you've got to have faith.  hank's a few fries short of a kiddie meal.  he's not the only one. look.  it's 80, but the little kids are acting like it's snowing.  gretchen: ah, youth.  i used to get excited about christmas, too.  yeah, back then, everything seemed so big the presents, the tree, my aunt enid.  actually, now she seems even bigger.  i used to start my christmas list the day after halloween.  i made two columns one for educational toys, the other for research and technical pamphlets.  i used to try staying up late to get a glimpse of santa.  but now that we're older, we all know the truth about him.  not all of us.  mikey:  dear santa, i hope everything is going okay.  claus and the elves.  doing well, i trust.  as you might expect, i have a few requests.  mikey, you still sweating over that letter to santa.  it's important.  he's got a column for lazy writers on the naughty list.  i hadn't heard.  once he goes online, it will be much easier.   oh, boy, the bell.  i'd love to chat, but it's time for the christmas show tryouts.  . mi, mi, mi, mi, mi .  i just don't get this santa character.  why doesn't he charge for these toys.  what's his motivation.  they've got to be kidding.  it is beneath my dignity to play a glazed ham.   hey, mikey, you're not in line.  i thought you wanted to audition.  i'm just here to soak up the atmosphere.  now, where was i.  oh, yes.  this year, besides peace on earth and good will toward men, i'd like a volume of shakespeare and "the oxford book of modern poetry," and, oh, yeah, gumballs, lots of gumballs.   okay, pipe down, you yuleigans, or you'll be in detention till christmas yet to come.  everybody who's trying out for santa over there, and everybody who wants to be a reindeer or an elf get over there.  right this way, mr. bream.  as you can see, the auditorium is extremely well equipped.  see those stage lights.  they're on dimmers.  amazing.  ah, miss finster, this is mr. bream.  he's looking for a school to use in his holiday tv special.  it's a nondenominational extravaganza.  i've told you this three times.  would you excuse me.  gladly.  this is big, finster, really big.  if we can convince this bream guy to use our school for his tv show, it will put third street on the map.  that's fine, sir.  there's only one problem.  he's halfway out the door.  mr. bream, wait.  i've seen enough, prickly.  i'm looking for something special.  we've got special, don't we, miss finster.  schools are begging to be part of this hookup.  i've got poipu prep and their hula hanukkah celebration waiting to go in waikiki.  what can you offer me.  what about that kid from the spring fling.  you know, the one with the voice.  yeah, the voice.  bream, i'll give you the greatest kid santa you ever heard.  what do you feed these kids.  wait till you hear him.  mr. bream: okay, kid, give me a ho ho ho.  ho ho ho.  try it again, son, and this time with feeling.  ho ho ho.  i thought you said this kid was special.  he is.  just give me a second.  come on, kid.  you're killing me here.  do it like you did for that music teacher.  you know, miss salamone.  miss salamone.  . ha ha ha, yes, it's true .  . little brown jug, how i love you .  it was like breathing for the soul.  . ho ho hoooo .  that is my santa.  gus: you were great, mikey.  you're going to be the perfect santa claus.  i've always tried to follow santa's teachings.  teachings.  be nice to kids, maintain a positive body image.  oh, brother.  i'm playing one of the greatest human beings in history.  i've got to do something special to mark the event, but what.  i'll invite santa to the show.  are you sure.  he's a busy man.  you don't want to get disappointed.  disappointed.  not only will i get to play the part, but i'll get to perform it for the great man himself.  you remember the zip code to the north pole.  ha. santa's zip code.  that's easy.  it's all zeros, like you.  you're just mad 'cause you didn't get the part.  i've got news for you, dumbweiler.  even if i did get to be santa, i would have turned it down 'cause i don't play characters that aren't real.   what's that supposed to mean.  get lost, you little weasel, or i'll show you the true meaning of christmas punch.  don't listen to him, mikey.  he'll say anything to get your goat.  but what did he mean santa isn't real.  you know how kids say that stuff.  what kids.  kids who don't believe in santa.  there are kids who don't believe in santa.  well, at least we all believe in santa, right, guys.  right.  well, you see, mikey, ..  are you guys saying youdon't believe in santa.  it's not that we don't.  ..  we're not real sure.  you have to admit, mikey, the concept of an overweight man delivering presents to several million children in one night is a tad difficult to accept.  mikey, let me explain no, you don't have to.  it's very clear.  you all think there's no santa.  we're sorry, mikey.  don't feel sorry for me.  i feel sorry for you.  santa's real, and if you guys don't believe it, then i'll just have to prove it to you.  you'll see.  mikey, wait.  it's the tooth fairy incident all over again.  blue skies. sunny days.  snow's acoming.  1, 2, 3, kick.  1, 2, 3, kick.  that's it, girls.  dance like the reindeer inside you.  i'm telling you, marty, this is big.  i've got harvey hanukkah.  i've got dancing reindeer.  i got the spirit of kwanzaa, who i've named "good king kwanzaa," by the way.  even the most jinglebrained political correctoid won't be able to complain aboutthisshow.  he took that santa thing hard.  he had to hear about it sooner or later.  you can't go through life thinking santa's a real guy.  you say you need proof to believe in santa.  well, here it is.  if santa's not real, how come he's in all these books.  "san diego," "sanitation," oh, here it is santa claus.  "santa claus has a variety of names in different languages, "but all refer nicholas, "who was born in turkey in the 3rd century " well, why did they write about him in thescientific journal.  somebody figured out that for santa to reach all the kids in the world in one night, he would have to slide down 5 chimneys per second.  that's if he didn't stop for milk and cookies.  there's no santa.  that's what they want you to believe.  who's they.  there's a worldwide conspiracy to hide the truth about santa's existence.  oh, come on, big guy.  face the facts.  i'll show you facts.  where are you going.  to prove that santa's real, once and for all.  ah, here's my goldenthroated santa now.  where's the boy going.  you know temperamental artists.  he's probably angry about the bottled water in his dressing room.  he'll be back.  he'd better be, or else it's going to be a yuletide luau live from waikiki.  spinelli: man, this is embarrassing.  we're the oldest kids in line.  hey, no pushing.  it'll be worth it when i prove that santa's real.  welcome to the north pole south.  toilettrained children only.  there's a $6 donation for photos.  we're getting photographic evidence.  ho ho ho.  welcome, children.  my, so many in your group.  who wants to go first.  i do. i do.  say, you're a big fella, aren't you.  santa, my friends here don't believe you're real.  do something magic, like tell them all their addresses or shrink yourself to chimney size or sing to them in dutch.  well, boys and girls, your friend is your friend is your friend is too heavy.  ow. ow. my trick knee.  tricia, get lenny in here to cover me.  he's up at the food court.  that bum spends more time eating than talking to kids.  this thing is driving me nuts.  hey, you try wearing a polyester beard for four hours in this heat.  gus: maybe santa was having a bad day.  that wasn't santa.  that was an impostor.  they come out of the woodwork this time of year.  where are we going.  to see therealsanta.  he's riding in the parade.  we better hurry, or we're going to miss him.   look, it's rainy weathers, the channel 14 weathergirl.  there's commander blade " and he's got jasper with him.   here he comes.  here comes santa claus.  i mean, it looks like him.  okay, mikey, you proved there's a santa.  now let's get back to the christmas show.  not yet.  mikey, no.  what happened.  santa, it's me mikey.  oh, mikey, what can i do for you.  i need your help, santa.  my friends have lost their faith.  tell them you really do live at the north pole and how you really do fly in your sleigh.  uh, ho ho ho.  mikey's right, kids.  i am the real santy claus.  i left my workshop for the day to ride in your parade because i needed a break from the sawing and hammering in the toy shop.  wow, mikey's right.  heisreal.  and to prove i'm the real santy, how about some homemade christmas candy straight from the north pole.  i'm starting to like this guy.  hey, ned, where's that bag of caramel cubes.  i put them in your briefcase, sir.  ha ha ha.  here you go, kids.  what, you don't like caramel cubes.  mayor fitzhugh.  ththat's right, kiddies.  i'm mayor fitzhugh andsanty claus.  now tell mommy, daddy, and any siblings of voting age that i'm both swell guys rolled into one.  here, have some candy.  electioneering as santa.  that's low, fitzhugh, really low.  get us out of here, ned.   are you okay, mikey.  ii just don't understand what's happened to santa claus.  man:ho ho ho, ricky.  it's good to be on your show.  ricky:hey, santa, i got to ask you, those reindeer are they expensive to feed and groom.  ricky, yousleighme.  you got my belly shaking like a bowl full of jelly.  hey, that rhymes.  ho ho ho.  he's on the radio.  hey, we're talking live to santa in the studio, right here on wxms, where we've always needed asanity clause.  where's santa.  there's no santa here.  man: ho ho ho.  there isn't.  no one's allowed inside.  everyone knows the answer to that one, ricky.  i magically stop time on christmas eve.  i stop time when i'm doubleparked and don't want to get a ticket.  can i take you with me the next time i go shopping.   why, look, ricky, there's a little boy.  ho ho. come in, little boy.  what's your name, little boy.  i'm mikey, but you're not santa.  you're ricky mccloud, the d.j. on the bus posters.  you're just pretending to be santa.   time for a word from our sponsor dingle's doughnuts.  play along.  there's kids out there who still believe in this hokey santa junk.  where's your christmas spirit.  it's gone, mr. mccloud.  it's gone, and it's never coming back.  look, mikey, santa can't possibly make all the personal appearances he's supposed to make this time of year.  that's what killed elvis.  stop it, okay.  i was wrong, and you were right.  there is no santa.  i've been a fool, believing in something that wasn't true.  i used to wait up to hear the hooves on my roof.  i used to leave cookies and milk for him to eat, but now i know the truth.   hey, look at the bright side, mikey.  you're going to be on tv tomorrow.  no, i'm not going to that christmas show.  i'm not playing santa.  but, mikey, everyone's counting on you.  i don't care.  santa's a big fake, christmas is a big lie, and i just won't take part in it.  now i know how the grinch must have felt.   no snow around for 500 miles.  got to have faith, got to have faith, and maybe some cloudseeding equipment.  we should probably get in our costumes.  i don't know.  i feel so bad for mikey.  maybe one of us should tell principal prickly mikey's not showing up.  hey, what he don't know can't hurt him.  ooh, dirt.  where's that kid.  did you find him.  no, sir, and i'm afraid i've got bad news.  mikey's not coming.  what.  sir, may i make a suggestion.  i believe randall would make a fine santa replacement.  " hee hee hee.   buy, buy, buy.  ho ho ho.  buy, buy, buy.  ho ho ho.  capitalist dupe.  buy, buy, buy.  ho ho ho.  you're not santa.  nobody is.   oh, wow, claydoh.  and it's still soft.   a pink crayon.  how did you know.  that's what i call the spirit of christmas, eh, mikey.  how did you know my name.  oh, i've seen you around.  what are you doing.  thinking.  looks more like moping to me.  i got some bad news about a friend.  is your friend going to be all right.  i don't know, seeing as how he doesn't exist.  you're talking about that jolly fella gives out toys, the one they draw wearing a beard.  i tried to prove to my friends he was real and only ended up proving to myself that he's not.  now i want to give up.  this is a time for giving, mikey, not giving up.  just because you can't see something with your eyes or hear it with your ears doesn't mean it's not real.  some things exist in here.  in your heart.  if you can believe in santa in your heart, then he is real, and so is everything he stands for, like giving and selflessness and friendship.  i don't know, mister.  even if i could start believing in him again, i know my friends can't.  maybe there's a way you can give them that belief back.  that would be the greatest christmas gift of all.   well, i better get inside.  it's tapioca night.  merry christmas, mikey.  merry christmas, mister.  this is it, prickly.  in three minutes, we're going live to five billion viewers.  fffive billion.  so that santa kid better be ready.  otherwise, we're live from beautiful waikiki.  we're getting the feed from

day.  hey, mister, how did you know about my show.  you invited me, remember.  i did.  wait. you dropped something.  hey, wait a minute.  who was the geezer you were talking to.  isn't that the letter
