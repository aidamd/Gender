detweiler. that's my putting hand.   hello, pete. remember me .  well, well, if it isn't phillium benedict.  i should've known you'd be the one behind this. you know this guy .  ah, pete and i are old pals.  although the last time we saw each other, pete was the one ruiningmylife.  it's italian. raw silk. nice, huh .  you always were more concerned about appearances than people, phil.  there's no need to be rude.  not after i instructed my men to take such special care of you.  that's what you call gagging me, tying me up and taking away my pants .  otherwise, you might run off and betray me, like you did the last time.  but, hey, look at the bright side.  at least you've got company now.  let the boy go. he can't do anything to you.   same old noble pete.  always standing up for the rights of children.  you .  but, unfortunately, i can't let anybody go right now.  you see, this experimental, um, night school that i'm running is kind of a secret.  i'm trying to show that my... it was back inthe spring of '68.  we were all young, idealisticand ready to change the world.     oh . ha ha ha. peace, peter.  hey, muriel, had a groovy time at the dead concert last night.  you gonna be at the teachin saturday .  we're gonna paint my volkswagen.  wouldn't miss it for the world. groovy.  yes, we all thoughtwe were pretty cool.  but one guywas the coolest of us all. phillium benedictwas my best friend.  he was smart, he was handsome.  he had justbeen named principalof 3rd street school.   so, phillium, how's it feel being the youngest principal in the history of the state .  copacetic, baby.  young is in, man, and old is out.  way out.  do you like the american flag helmet, pete . it does go with the leather jacket, right .  you are one groovy educator, phil.  cool. follow me, my man.  i wanna show you my new principal's pad.  gilbert.  gilbert.  what's all the racket who are you.  i'm the goldfish under the couch cushion.  you can call me the gofish under the couch cushion.  is our friend under there.  is your friend loose change.  this is him.  handsome kid, never saw him.  come on, we got to keep looking.  hey, don't give up hope.  never.  come back if you're looking for the tv remote.  goldfish crackers.  always baked and made with real cheese.  . the snackthat smiles back .  goldfish.  whoa .  psychedelic principalia.  pull up a bag, bro. i wanna rap.  you see, pete, i been thinkin'.  we're a new generation of teachers, right .  it's time we shook things up a little.  i hear you, brother. in fact, dig this.  i was meditating to that new ravi shankar ..  when i got this righteous notionwhat if we hold all our classes outside, on the playground .  imagineschool, recess. no boundaries.  hey, baby, that's a hip idea, but i got a better thought here.  as my first official act as principal, .. to get rid of recess.  what . no recess .  but, phil, for a kid, recess is like a major playin.  it's the one time of day they have any freedom.   look, pete, the '60s are over.  all that peace and love and freedom stuff, it was great for pickin' up chicks, but it's not gonna help my career.  to do that, i gotta make test scores go up, and to make test scores go up, i gotta keep kids in class where they belong.  that's why, starting tomorrow, i am tuning ..  once and for all.  needless to say, phillium's plandidn't go over all that well.    what do we want .  recess .  when do we want it . now .  recess . now .  you're bumming my mellowness.  we'll be cool when you give our kids their recess back.  hey, baby, i'll do what i want.  i'm principal of the school, and there's nothing anyone can do about it. dig .   it's not right .  people, people, please calm down.  prickly here has informed me of this "no recess" proposal.  let me assure you that as long as i'm superintendent, this radical plan will never be carried out in this district.   hey, man, you just don't get it .  of course i do, benedict.  that's why i'm replacing you. what .  prickly, from now on, you will be principal.  who, me .  oh, i see what's going down here.  you tricked me, went around my back to the man to get my job .  yeah, right .  come on, muriel baby, let's blow this scene.  i could never be with a man who doesn't love recess.  so you're against me too.  i don't need anyone .  aaah . phil . you okay, man .  don't touch me .  you took my chick.  you took my job.  well, enjoy it while you can, petey boy, 'cause you're gonna pay.  somehow, someway, you're gonna pay.  i never saw phillium again.  he quit teaching, went into politics, eventually became secretary of educationuntil the president fired him for trying to get rid of recess again.  only this time it was nationwide.  so that guy's some weirdo exteacher who wants to get rid of recess .  mmhmm. okay.  now it's personal.  let's seeweather maps, some stuff in norwegian, afarmer's almanac.  must be something in here that'll explain what that dr. benedict is doing.  i'll tell you one thing he's not doing22 with his little girlfriend.  spinelli, that's the man's personal date book.  well, it's mine now, and i guess miss luna pergum is gonna be at the restaurant all by herself.  the girl whose name is in hereluna pergum.  must be some italian chick.  lunae perigeum. of course .  don't you understand .  lunae perigeumis no lady. it's an event.  look.  once a month, the moon reaches the point where it's closest to the earthlunar perigee, which in this case happens to be 12:22 tomorrow afternoon.  maybe that's when that doctor guy is gonna shoot his laser at the moon and blow it up.  close guess, but i have another theory.  when i was up at space camp, i observed some abnormalities in the moon's position.  i couldn't figure out what was causing it, but now it all makes sense.  benedict's device is not a laser beam at all. it's a tractor beam .  you mean he's gonna plow the moon's surface . whatever will he plant .  not a tractor, you goombah. a tractor beam.  like from a science fiction movie.  precisely.  ..  were shot at the moon exactly at lunar perigee, it could move the moon into another orbit.  but why would anybody want to do that .  who knows, vince . who knows .   here we are, sir.  i can't believe you have been creeping around in these vents. they're school property.  dang . the line's dead.  hey, what did you do with the walkietalkie you confiscated from me last week .  just look what phil's done to my office.  i had it all nice and clean for the summer.  packs of gum, yoyos, my old baseballhey, i've been looking for

"in a few years, they're all going to be grownups, like me, and all those good times will just be memories " so go ahead, put a whoopee cushion in my chair, cover my carpet with fake vomit, make fun of my big, saggy butt.  but don't you ever say i don't care about summer vacation, 'cause those memories are the last part of childhood i've got left.  principal prickly, i had no idea.  yeah, well, now you do.  how did you get those keys .  swiped 'em off phillium's desk when he wasn't looking.  we've got a summer vacation to save.    woman: if your child is falling behind in school, if your child struggles with math or reading, let them blossom at sylvan.  sylvan learning centers, an individualized approach tailored for each child to build exactly the skills your child needs to succeed, guaranteed to improve math or reading skills by one full grade level equivalent in 36 hours of instruction.  if you want to see results ..   just quiet down for a moment .  oh, man, nobody's listening.  they'll listen to me, once i introduce them to my good friend madam fist.  that's your answer for everything.  i don't see you coming up with any great ideas, sports boy.  you're not helping at all.    quiet .  what we need is a leader.  a kid with the right training.  a kid who knows strategy and field tactics.  a kid who commands respect.  yeah, but where we gonna find a kid like that .  leave that to me.    please . we have to get organized.  ah, what's the use .  if what you say is true, all the fun of being a kid is, like, totally ruined anyway.  it's like the whole world's been turned right side up.  all we have to do is work together and come up with a plan.  detweiler's the one who always comes up with the plans. let's face itwe're doomed.    that's whatyouthink .  kids of the playground, meet your new commanding officer.  griswald . he couldn't lead a glee club.  you find that funny, bradley .  i'm here to make history .  so if you wanna laugh, take it somewhere else.  but if you wanna save the world, then suck in your gut and stand at attention.  now who's with me .     soda bomb . soda bomb .  vince, you and the ashleyswill be " " spinelli, you get the special forces.  special forces . the kindergartners.  now there's one last thing i need to say.   this mission is bigger than any one of us kids.  even bigger than principal prickly.  this, my friends, is about the future.  he's on a roll.  years from now when kids who aren't even born yet look back on this moment, they'll say, "they did it.  "those kids saved 3rd street school.  " so, boys and girls, we're goin' in.  very good, fenwick.   hello, boys. hey .    where now . the auditorium.  check.    nessun dorma    huh .   nessun dorma    is that a kid .   ma il mio mistero e chiuso in me   hey, kid, get out of here .  anderson, get rid of that kid, will ya .   il nome mio nessun sapra    no, no   smithson, underhill. sir.   sulla tua boca    lo diro    quando la luce  hanklin, morrissey, goodman, get over here .  yes, sir. right away, sir. on the double.  don't worry about it.  you sure this is gonna work, detweiler .  don't you ever watch old spy movies .  this trick is pure gold.  benedict wanted to speak to us about a very important matter.  hey, you two aren't guards.  run .   i'm called little buttercup   where is everybody .  aah, if you want something done right, you gotta do it yourself.   poor little buttercup    sweet little buttercup, i   boy, these spaceage power shovels sure do a great job.  quick, in here.  this way . they're inside.  we lost 'em. now what .  ammo.   tender.  commence phase two.  ready .  hey, guards . huh .   you little brats .  now .  intruders .   scandalous .   now . huh .  bombard, men .  get 'em.

after all this planning, all this work, you can get me to stop just by saying, "don't do it" .  what if we add "please" .  you kids just don't get it, do you .  well, let me explain this in a way your little uneducated brains will understand.  the american public think test scores are too low.  but if a person, say me, could make test scores go up, why, everybody'd feel better.  .. president of the united states.  now, do you have any idea which countries have the highest test scores .  tierra del fuego .  canada, iceland, norway .  because it's snowing up there all the time.  kids don't waste their summers playing ball.  they're inside studying.  and that is why i'm getting rid of summer vacation once and for all.  your plan will never work.  sure, maybe your crazy laser beam can move the moon.  maybe it can even make it snow all summer.  maybe you can get rid of long afternoons playing baseball, or sunny days down by the lake or warm nights camping out under the stars.  we'll ride our bikes through the snow.  we'll play kick ball in the slush, we'll camp out in igloos.  you may take away summer, but you'll never take away summer vacation.  .. now .  yes, sir. begin photon
