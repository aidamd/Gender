 righteous.  shucks.  weren't nothing but a thing.  the other schools arrive at recess today.  until then rest up, and beware of the meat in the cafeteria.  if it's gray, stay away.  vince taking on the best arms and feet from every school in town.  isn't it great, spinelli.  only problem is i'll be a failure by then.  what.  it's that math test.  i was going to study, but i got busy.  the minister of mayhem squared off against frank the florist of fear.  you skipped studying for wrestling.  doesn't everybody.  lasalle, this was supposed to be my year my turn to toss, boot, and punt for third street.  you come along and beat me.  how do you do it.  hmm, let's see.  maybe it's my shoes.  well, i got the same shoes as you.  then it couldn't be the shoes 'cause i beat you bad.  hey, i know.  maybe it's this.  a marble.  not just a marble a lucky marble.  i should've known it was something like that.  for a minute there i thought you were better than me.  do third street proud, lasalle.  you still have that.  never leave home without it.  vince, we got this math test ..  don't say another word.  i've never done this before, but seeing as how you need a little extra juice ..  be sure to get it back before the toss, boot, and punt contest.  thanks, vince.  good luck.  no need.  i got it right here.  a charm is a very personal possession.  if you cherish your friendship, guard it with your life.  shows what you know.  if the thing works, then i'll be lucky.  ipso flipso, nothing bad can happen. duh.  did i just get duh'd.  i hope you all took my advice and had a nice piece of fish for breakfast, as this test will require lots of brain power.  come on, marble.  hey, i know this stuff.  fractions, fractions they just kept coming, sarge.  wave after wave.  it was horrible.  that was one tough test.  my brain hurts.  personally, i feel listless and unchallenged.  boys and girls, feast your eyes on the minister of math.  thanks to this little bad boy, those answers just popped right into my head.  it was almost as if i'd been paying attention all year.  hey, look, the buses from the other schools are here.  my marble. spinelli.  where you going.  we're about to get underway.  be right back, coach.  i need more cereal.  oh, complex carbos.  way to train smart, son.  yep, with a marble like this, who knows what i could do.  look, here comes vince.  but first i got to wash it.  you know what they say a clean charm is a lucky charm.  where'd spinelli go.  i need my charm.  the competition's about to start.  she was just here.  she's washing your charm.  i can handle the toss without it, but i'll need it back before the boot portion.  ah, good as new.  vince really needs that marble.  i just want to make sure i didn't wash the luck out of it.  you wouldn't want me to give back a defective good luck charm, would you.  now let's see.  what takes some real luck.  yes.  only a fool would try it a fool with a fistful of luck.  friends, i'm going to prove this thing still works.  gretchen, your bow, please.  what are you doing.  i'm going to make hustler kid a wager.  you're not going to try to get your christmas presents back.  yep, with one blindfolded shot.  if you miss.  all my stuff is yours.  she's got some really cool junk.  it's going to hurt to take it all away.  what am i saying.  i'm going to love it.  shorty, hand her the egg.  spinelli, the odds against your sticking this particular "j" are astronomical.  prepare to gasp, luckless chickens.  the marble will guide me.  i can't look.  together: yay.  of all the rotten luck.  depends who's talking.  you got one week to get me my stuff, son.  man, this baby's dripping with luck and i'm living, breathing, math testpassing, basketswishing proof.  now give the marble back to vince.  yeah, yeah.  just one more test, only this time bigger.  here we go again.  you aren't going to jump, are you.  you bet i am.  but you stink at jumprope.  that was then, this is now.  . mink and seal and tiger and bear .  . cute or cuddly we don't care .  . snip it, cut it be sure it's not fake .  . how many fur coats .  ..2...3 .  all: yay.  not bad, for a second grader.  kids: ooh.  like, look who's talking, miss two left boots.  you can do better.  watch and learn.  . ashley, ashley, turn around .  . ashley, ashley, touch the ground .  . ashley, ashley, in a skirt .  . ashley, ashley, go eat dirt .  kids: yay.  in your face, ashleys.  no one beats the cat's eye, and while i hold it, nothing bad can possibly happen.  no.  yay.  not bad, lasalle.  now limber up that kicking foot.  will do, coach, but first another bowl of cereal.  way to dance with what brung you, you special fourth grader.  oh, man, i'm so upset about this thing, i think i'm going to hurl.  on top of that, here comes vince.  where's spinelli going.  ..  what he said.  i need that charm.  i did good at passing.  i should be all right at the kicking, but punting is my weak spot.  she say when she'd be back.  well, if you see her, tell her i need it quick.  looks like vince's winning streak is down the drain.  oh, man, this whomps.  vince trusted me and i lost his lucky marble.  this is a classic friendshipender.  guys, guys, i think i see it.  there's got to be some way to get that marble out of there.  hey, i got an idea.  anybody got a stick.  here you go.  spinelli, give me your gum.  stick the gum on the stick.  i see where you're going with this.  i poke the gummy stick through the grate and presto we snag the marble.  uh, spinelli, how long you been chewing that gum.  couple of days.  why.  kids: yay.  you're leading the pack.  you just got to outpunt that big kid the boot.  don't forget to take three steps before you kick the ball.  but, coach, i only take two steps, like in the pros.  this isn't the pros.  i'm doomed.  i'm doomed.  no, you're not.  tada.  no, mikey, we need more gum, not another stick.  it's not a stick.  it's a very long straw.  i'm going to suck that marble up.  oops, i think i swallowed it.  the marble's still down there.  uh, i got to go to the nurse.  now what are we going to do.  behold explorer z3000.  just a little extracredit project i worked up for science class.  as soon as the patent goes through, well, let's just say that college is paid for.  you think that thing that's why i brought it out.  i've calibrated enough dexterity into the z3000's robotic arm that it should reach the marble.  up and at them, robo fingers.  what's going on.  i can't control it.  i think she's still got a few bugs to work out.  what are you doing, spinelli.  sliming up my arm so it can slide through the grate.  you can't reach the marble.  i got to try.  i'm staring down the barrel of a friendshipender here.  yes.  no.  well, i guess it's all over.  aw, come on, spinelli, you're overreacting.  no, vince trusted me with something important to him.  i lost it.  now he's going to hate me.  me and the rest of the guys won't let you borrow stuff, but we'll still like you.   okay, next up, the boot.  come on, spinelli, i need that thing.  a 50yarder.  looks like vince is up next.  now seems like a good time to hide, spinelli.  sometimes a kid has got to face the sound.  vince deserves the truth.  you're up, lasalle.  hey, vince.  perfect timing.  i'm up next.  my good luck charm.  yeah, about that.  listen, i'll completely understand if you hate me and never talk to me again, but i lost your lucky marble.  it was an accident, okay.  i know i shouldn't have let it happen, but i did, and ii come on, man.  saysomething.  well, i don't know what to say, except hey, look, a shiny nickel.  this has to be better luck than that crummy marble.  let's go, lasalle.  got to book.  remember three steps, not two.  60 yards.  if they could just bottle what that kid eats.   but but what about acing the test and beating the ashleys at jumprope.  it sure wasn't the marble.  maybe it's all about selfconfidence.  yeah, maybe you got something there.  where you going.  to see the ashleys about a rope.  you can never rub it in enough with those girls.   hello, little friend.  isn't it a perfect day, a day to treasure, a day to savor.  yeah, the swinger girl is swinging, ..  and all is well with the world.  there you go again, doing it all wrong.  your digging would improve if you choked up on your shovel a little.  it works just fine the way i got it.  well, it'll be wrong, but you can do it.  how would you know, considering you never work.  i've been carrying you since kindergarten.  you'vebeen carryingme.  that's right, pal i've been carrying you, and you just got a little too heavy.  fine. i don't need you.  in fact, i'll get a lot more work done without you yapping at me all day long.  you wouldn't know which end of the shovel was up.  it's this one, pal.  goodbye.  guys, what just happened here.  unless i'm mistaken, the diggers split up.  why did this happen. why.  mikey, you're taking this way too hard.  so the diggers had a little tiff. big whoop.  the diggers have been digging together ever since i can remember.  if they can split up over some silly fight, what does that say about any friendship, even ours.  those two guys can't stay mad at each other for one minute.  i'll bet they patched the whole thing up by nooow.  are you all right.  ..i guess.  can't stop.  behind schedule. must dig.  : what are you doing digging a hole by the door.  a kid could get hurt.  where's digger dave.  who.  your partner about yay big, helmet, filthy.  got no partner.  this gopher digs alone.  you and dave haven't buried the hatchet.  no bury. only dig.  man, digger sam without digger dave.  i never thought i'd see the day.  poor dave all alone, no friends, a digger with a hole in his heart.  morning, boys and girls.  digger dave, is that you.  i'm not digging anymore.  doing the old regularkid thing now.  what about your hole.  what about sam.  sam. refresh me.  your partner.  you two were a team like laurel and hardy.  gilbert and sullivan.  the mad masher and killer calhoun.  hey, professional wrestlers have relationships, too.  my digging days with what'shisname are over.  what are you doing.  we were going to play some kickball at recess.  excellent.  i'll play first base.  excuse me.  that's my position.  you might want to watch how i play it.  it's a good way to learn.  come on, teej, give me something good.  one unkickable uncle charlie coming up.  whoa, whoa, whoa, time, teej.  what are you doing, directing air traffic.  this is how i pitch.  i'm surprised you haven't pulled a hammy.  gee, i don't want to get hurt.  guess i could try it your way.  iwould.  thanks for the melon ball, teej.  yeah, well, at least i didn't pull a hammy.  i got it, i got it.  move right, move right.  too far. left, left.  no, right, right, right.   tried to warn you.  maybe i should clear out the east wall like this, but then how do i take care of the west wall.  maybe i should fortify the south side, then tackle the subcircles, or or oh, i'm so confused.  poor digger sam.  he's so flustered, he can't figure out what to dig next.  mind if i join you.  you going to tell us how to eat.  it would have been funnier if you said, "are you going to tell us " i'll show you funny.  he's going through some stuff.  uh, pardon me, dave, but that's normally my seat.  i'm aware that my behavior is mildly obsessivecompulsive, but this is where i sit.  always have.  between this seat and first base, a kid could get the idea you own everything.  what you eating.   peanut butter and pickles.  peanut butter and pickles.  what kind of lunch is that.  hey.  there.  now that's a lunch.  i was going to eat that.  take it up with gus.  okay, it's tetherball time.  actually, dave, we were thinking of playing foursquare today.  foursquare.  that was never the plan.  we're playing tetherball.  come on, let's go.  time's awasting.  ..that was my dessert.   man, i thought this day would never end.  if dave gave me one more piece of constructive criticism, i was going to construct him a knuckle sandwich.  you're making me hungry.  dave wouldn't let me eat.  it was a cube of gelatin dessert.  get over it.  i can't.  man, i never knew digger dave was so bossy.  nor did i know digger sam was so ambitious.  look at that boy dig.  what's up, man.  can't talk. got to dig.  what are you planning on doing with all these holes.  that information is diggeraccess only.  sure, sam.  whatever you say.  that guy's a mess.  look what he's doing to the playground.  the playground will be filled with more craters than the dark side of the moon.  it's a rather interesting phenomenon.  without dave telling him what to do, sam is completely unfocused and therefore digs everywhere.  without sam to boss around, dave is bossing us around.  our only hope is to get the diggers back together.  they won't even talk to each other.  maybetheywon't, but there's nothing stopping us from talking for them.  no, no, no, you do it like that, and all the blood will rush to your head.  i was giving upsidedown girl pointers on hanging upside down.  you're clenching again.  we thought it might be a good idea if you apologized to sam.  me apologize to him.  are you kidding.  he's the one who should apologize to me.  have you seen the way he digs.  he's all over the map.  giving up digging was the best thing i ever did.  hey, you with that book.  you call that reading.  do i have to show everybody how to do everything.  do something about him, detweiler.  if i have to come down, no one's going to be happy.  hey, digger sam, can we talk.  can't talk. digging.  we got a problem.  it's dave, isn't it.  it's just that he's telling you what to do.  bossing you around.  he's starting to drive you nuts.  the reason he's acting like this is because he's miserable without you.  he's acting like this because he was born.  "sam, hold your shovel " " come on, you're forgetting all about the good times.  remember the first time you guys met.  oh, yeah.  digging good.  digging bad. use this.  waah.  waah.  as far as i'm concerned, he'syourproblem now.  enjoy the criticism.  i know one thing that will get those little gravelheads back together.  let me at them.  come on, spinelli.  violence won't solve anything.  i'll clobber dave so hard, samwill feel it.  i think you might have something there.  i do.  gretchen, what do you know about plate tectonics.  more than a master's, less than a phd.  if this works, sam and dave should be friends again before the last bell rings.  onesies, twosies, threesies how many times do i have to tell you that's not threesies.  how many times do we have to tellyouto get lost.  excuse me, dave, i need your expertise.  what is it you want.  i'm doing a science project on the soil content of the playground.  i was hoping you could help.  my days in the dirt are over.  i've hung up my shovel.  but dirt is so fascinating.  there's the exhilaration ..  starting a hole.  the thrill of exploring ..  crawling in mud.  being one with the earth.  dirt in your underwear.  how about a whiff for old times' sake.  mmm, that aroma so rich and full of earthy textures despite its questionable clay content.  wait, no.  i see what you're doing.  don't you know how to trick people.  it's a nightmare.  there's been a cavein.  what cavein.  digger sam's tunnel it collapsed.  all we found were his helmet and shovel.  sam in trouble.  i'm coming for you, sammy boy.  that's not how you save someone.  let me show you how it's done.  sam. sam.  it's me, buddy dave.  hang in there.  do not give up.  i will find you.  spinelli, this ice cream is just the break i dave, what are you doing.  i'm saving sam.  what does it look like sam, you weren't trapped in the cavein.  why would i be trapped in a cavein.  because you i was, uh you were trying to save me.  but i thought you hated me.  hate you. no.  i thought you hated me.  i don't hate you, dave.  it's that attitude of yours.  attitude. what attitude.  you know, you're, well, bossy.  me bossy. i'm not bossy.  am i bossy.  jawohl, mein kommandant.  maybe you're right.  i could try not to boss you so much.  that would be great, 'cause the truth is i missed you, dave.  i missed you, too, pal.  you got some digging to do.  i mean, if you want to.  do i want to.  is bedrock hard.  just look at them together again, caring for each other in peace and harmony.  we've done a good thing here today.  this may be our true calling.  perhaps it's time we spread the word, roaming the world from playground to playground, teaching children from all walks of life the true meaning of friendship.  ..or we can play some kickball.  works for me.  all: yeah.  captions paid for by abc cable networks group ahh. isn't it beautiful.  i've never seen the surface so calm.  unlike your father will be ..  ..  sunning yourself.   hi, ariel.     ariel.  aah.  yikes.  aah.  help.   spot.     yadda yadda yadda.  oh, spot, i knew you'd come back.  mmm.  well, well, my boy.  you're all growed up.  yeah. his teeth are all growed up, too.  how you been, spot.  aah.  oh, i've missed you so much.  just like old times, mon.  spot.   i hope we won't have a recurrence " oh, no, your majesty.  this is not so serious.  this time, spot will stay outside the palace.  better make it outside of atlantica as well.  why is everyone so afraid of killer whales.  other than that their first name is killer.  everyone would love him if they knew him.  i know spot wouldn't hurt anyone.  i'm just not sure spot knows it.    watch this, spot.  whoo.   ohh.  aah.  oof.   uhh. uhh.   oh, no.   you get a gold starfish for effort.  let me out, you overgrown oyster.  blecch.  an ocean full oflams, and i have to get the sensitive one. ) )
