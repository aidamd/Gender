 spinelli sort of took over during your absence.  she's less willing to talk things out.  man, nothing ever changes around here.  hey, what's with.  three stickers, please.  what are you talking about.  he's been out sick.  and here's a little something for you.  what was that.  there's been a change.  it's monstickers.  those dumb things kids put on their notebooks.  the colorful collectable stickers have become popular.  if you don't have monstickers, kids won't let you do anything.  you mean they're like money.  money doesn't feed your bloodsucking ghouls.  two stickers, please.  you can't charge for water.  i don't have any stupid stickers.  then you and i have a problem.  no, you don't, no problem at all.  hey, teej, take it easy.  i'm not made out of stickers, you know.  so then i told miss lemon, ' '"  since when does menlo have friends.  since he became the richest kid in school.  he's got family stickers.  his uncle gave him a case.  at 3rd street school, you miss a little, you miss a lot.  ah, here's a beauty all leather, rubberized grip.  who will give me five stickers.  i see five.  who will bid me six.  i don't have any stickers.  what do i do.  the balls are probably a little out of your league.  maybe you should find something cheaper to do.  i'll pay you back.  when you can.  ahh.  now this i can afford.  man, i got to get me some stickers.  sold out.  i'm out of monstickers, but i have these lick 'n' stick alien stamps.  they're the latest thing.  kids in japan are going ape for them.  yeah, right.  we're not falling for that camefromjapan stuff.  remember yoshi trolls.  come on, guys.  now what am i going to do.  without stickers, i'm sunk.  you can play kickball with us.  we won't charge you.  i got a little moping to do.  menlo: do mine eyes deceive me.  detweiler down on his luck.  what do you want.  just passing by.  it's a free country outside the playground, that is.  you know, detweiler, i've always fancied that cap of yours.  care to part with it.  i'll pay you handsomely.  i'm not selling my hat.  it's my identity, my trademark.  five monstickers for your trademark.  that should be attractive to a man in your situation.  all right, take the darn thing.  kind of whomps, doesn't it, detweiler.  toodles.   this will have to do for now.  i may be down on my luck, but i'm not out.  i'll work, sweat, and toil like no kid before me, and one day i'll have enough stickers to buy back my hat, my dignity, and maybe even a ball.  good work, boy.  thank you, sir.  always at your service.  thanks, kid.  i needed a breather.  no, no. thankyou.  you'll have to dig deeper if you want the four stickers.  i'm just glad to have the opportunity.  , now that you have stickers of your own, want to come to the ball auction.  no time.  want to earn a little something extra.  sam and dave pay top sticker.  you'll never catch me working at recess.  yeah, recess is for fun.  hey, i bet between us, we have enough for a tetherball game.  pick up the pace, detweiler.  man, i've been busting my hump for days and i'm still just a workingclass schmo living sticker to sticker.  there's got to be a better way.  wait a minute.  maybe there is.  i pay you 20 stickers upfront, i watch the door, and we split the take 5050.  30.  25.  deal.  i hated getting up early in the morning anyway.  hey, kid, want to make a few extra stickers.  sure.  i'll pay you two stickers a day to work the door for me.  just to stand there.  deal.  tender.  they seem to be doing a good job.  customer satisfaction is job one, and getting paid is job two.  start forking, boys.   say, isn't that the boy who used to nah, couldn't be.  that's two stickers from the kid with the purple lunch box.  going once, going twice 300 stickers for all the balls.  all the balls.  yeah, right.  does anyone care to outbid me.  then it seems you have no choice.  all: scandalous.  here's four stickers.  never say that again.  if you take all my balls, i'll be out of a job.  i don't intend to auction off the balls myself.  i'll keep you on.  wow. thanks, t.j.  i mean, mr. detweiler.  wow, teej.  you dropped some major stickerage back there.  those stickers will come back to me, and they'll bring friends.  i'm always looking for good, hardworking people to help me.  i'll understand if you guys would rather play.  play, schmay.  i need some jack. cut me in.  me, too.  i need water.  here are those reports on sticker spending.  good work, randall.  hmm, the slide is making a nice little comeback.  excuse me, mr. detweiler.  i was wondering if you might be interested in buying your old hat back.  well, well, how the mighty have fallen.  detweiler, i've lost everything.  i haven't a monsticker to my name.  too much gadding about, eh.  no matter. let's see.  you wearing the hat has lowered its value.  i suppose i could part with one sticker.  one sticker.  take it or leave it.  i'm a busy man.  all right, all right.  ha ha ha ha.  lunch tray revenues are starting to slip.  the kids are using books to carry food.  double the tray rental fee and institute a fine for anyone using their books to carry food.  excuse me, but according to my calculations, you now control four of every five monstickers.  now we just need to figure out a way to get the rest.  the kids can't afford to do anything as it is.  they don't have stickers for balls, to play on old rusty.  they can't even sit on the grass.  everyone works for you or stands around.  gus, start charging kids for standing around.  we'll call it a loitering fee.  you can't charge kids just to stand around.  where's that drink i asked for.  here you go nice, cold juice.  i very explicitly asked you for chocolate milk.  if you expect to be paid, start carrying your weight.  yes, sir, mr. t.j., sir.  , that was just a little kid.  we're all little kids.  it's the guts and spirit inside that makes us more.  you used to have something nice inside, but i'm still the same t.j.  i'm just rich.  this is one of the best playground balls i own.  you just don't get it, teej.  we don't want anything from you. we quit.  all: yeah.  fine, quit.  where's that chocolate milk.  it sure is amazing what a few stickers will do.  i never thought it would happen to t.j.  wow, a real ball.  i haven't seen one in days.  can i play with it.  not unless you got a handful of monstickers.  nobody's got monstickers anymore, but i got these lick 'n' stick alien stamps.  they come from japan.  hmm.  i'm glad you came aboard, randall.  now go get me some candy.  i just brought you candy.  detweiler wants candy, he wants candy, not excuses.  now go.  hello, old friend.  do you recognize me now that i'm rich.  i'm sorry about selling you, but it was necessary.  don't believe the scrap that they say.  they're all just jealous.  do you hear me.  it's just you and me now, cap, and randall if he ever gets back.  i can't go back there.  that guy is nuts.  i don't need anyone.  i'm a selfmade boy.  ..   ..world...world...  kids are laughing and playing.  old man kelser must have gotten more monstickers.  they'll be mine soon enough.  you there, boy, i'm feeling zesty.  i'll give you 20 stickers for that ball.  20 stickers.  you got a deal.  wait a minute.  these are monstickers.  of course they're monstickers, nitwit.  too bad.  i don't take monstickers.  what.  how many monstickers to rent your flying disc.  monstickers.  those are so over.  but but that's absurd.  two, please.  monstickers, right.  we're operating on lick 'n' stick alien standard.  alien stickers.  but no, it can't be.  ..   busted...  ..  looks like you could use a lift, man.  i don't deserve a lift, not after how i acted.  i got so caught up in hoarding stickers, i forgot i wanted them so i could play with you.  hey, we all make mistakes.  how about a round of kickball.  you guys would take me back just like that.  actually, there are a few conditions.  and finally, you shall vow never to seek control of more than 10% of the collectable stickers on the playground.  a kid's got to eat.  let me have 15%.  just sign it.  welcome back, t.j.  now let's go play.  i don't have a lick 'n' stick to my name.  i got to get to work.  oh, good, king bob looks sweaty.  uhoh.  man, look at all these kids.  it's never going to be our turn.  there are merely 27 kids ahead of us.  out of the way, fourthgrader.  make that 28.  come on, let me in.  help, help, i'm stuck.  i got it, i got it.  huh.   this school's getting more crowded every day.  overcrowdedness is a growing trend in the public school system.  at least we've got lunch to look forward to.  oh, no, not another line.  yeah, but this time it's worth it.  look what we're having.  tuna fish tacos my favorite.  good thing i brought my trusty hot sauce.  just one more kid.  hey, edith, we're out of tuna fish tacos.  oh, no.  don't panic.  the nutritionists are probably cooking up a fresh batch.  here you go, kids creamed liver and eggplant.  spinelli: what a lousy day.  i wish we had the whole school to ourselves.  nobody to mess up our kickball games.  nobody to make us wait in big lines.  nobody to snarf down all those tasty tacos.  who are we kidding.  it's just a dream.  there's no room for dreaming at 3rd street school.  yeah.  yeah.  yeah.   come on, guys, we're going to be late.  huh.  hey, where is everybody.  we must be later than i thought.  according to my watch, which i set to the atomic clock in boulder, colorado, it's only 30 seconds after 8:00.  if you're wrong, we'll get detention.  come on.  miss grotke.  huh.  i thought you kids were all sick today.  well, i feel fine.  you kids must not have eaten the fish tacos.  don't remind us.  every kid that did is sick.  we're all alone.  apparently.  but didn't you eat the fish tacos.  actually, gus, the faculty eats slightly different food than you kids do.  how's the pheasant prepared.  seared in a light plum sauce, served with braised asparagus.  excellent, and we'll need some more bread.  anyway, since the rest of the class is out, we're going to spend the day exercising the creative side of our brains.  ..  free day.  tender.    well, it seems to be time for recess.  you guys thinking what i'm thinking.  it's beautiful.  it's magnificent.  and it's ours all ours.  wait a minute.  what about finster.  i wonder where she is.  i'd feel better if you'd let me inspect the child in person.   hey, you, boy, fetch me a wingerdinger.   was there ever such a recess.  all that playing built me up an appetite.  wow.  i never realized this room was so big.  yeah no kids, no lines.  and look.  pizza.  pizza.  pizza.  ..  ..  and aw, heck, have as much as you want.  every guy gets his own table.  hey, vince, got a spare pepperoni.  he fades back, ..  touchdown.   you know, a fellow could get used to this.  i see the advantages of low studenttoteacher ratios.  it's weird, but i'm looking forward to school tomorrow.  good morning, healthy people.  looks like it's just us again.  .  i hope he hasn't gotten sick as well.  hi, sorry i'm late, but i didn't want to come unprepared.  i've got comics for everyone "seor fusion"s, volumes 1 through 273.  including his adventure with lobster boy.  got a chocolate stain on the cover, but the gold shines through.  i compliment you on your preparedness, but today will be more structured than yesterday.  what are you talking about, miss grotke.  since we're going to be on our own, i thought we'd try some alternate teaching methods.  let's start by refocusing our chi.  refocusing our chi.  in other words, everyone move up to the front row.  the energy feels better already.  man, this whomps.  what.  nothing.  now that there are just a few of you, i'll be able to give you the attention you deserve.  mikey: uhoh.  man, i hate being in the front row.  she sees everything.  at least we still have recess.  maybe we should play kickball.  we don't even have enough for one team.  want to break into the ashleys' clubhouse.  that's no fun without the ashleys to chase us.    oh, what's the use.  and that pretty much covers every subject and topic in the entire fourthgrade curriculum.  any questions. no.  well, then, let's get a head start on fifth grade.  at least we have lunch.  let's just chow down and oh, no.  please, not that.  leftover pizza.  not enough mouths to feed yesterday.  mmm. gimme.   before you go, i need you to take your sick classmates their homework.  miss grotke, every kid in class is sick.  that's why i prepared this map.  now, i've divided ..  why is this happening.  sort of ironic.  the thing we wished for has become our nightmare.  sooner or later, everyone's going to get better and come back to school.  most of them will be back tomorrow.  man, that must have been some bad tuna.  the lonely creak of empty swings, the cavernous echo of vacant bathrooms.  i'm going to do something i should have done a long time ago.  don't do something you're going to regret.  i need to, t.j.  don't try to stop me.  put down the note, gus, and everything will be okay.  never.  i could have got out.  i really could have.  "dear miss grotke, "please excuse our son gus from school today.  "he'd better stay home till the other kids are well.  signed, my mom".  that's pathetic.  is it.  sure, it's a crummy note, but gus was on to something.  if they thought we were sick, they'd let us out.  you want us all to write fake notes.  too obvious.  if the school nurse ..  why would she.  i have a thought.  follow me.  nurse kramer, we've got a problem.  gus isn't feeling too well.   oh, well, sit down here, gus.  you don't feel hot.   i'd better take your temperature.  put this thermometer in there and keep it in no, no.  don't take it out yet.  anything.  here's a good one.  well, it's normal.  are you sure you're sick.   do you have the bucket.  okay, i think i've got it.  oh, wow, i feel much better now.  thanks, mrs. kramer.  you are one great nurse.  you sure this is going to work, gretchen.  trust me, t.j.  the rest of you start eating that blue candy.  i've never seen such a thing.   what could be wrong with you.  perhaps you should seek help from an appropriate medical text.  where did i put that book.  second from the left.  let's see blue tongues, green spots.  here it is.  good sweet mike.  this is horrible.  you children are seriously ill.  gee, i guess you'll have to send us home.  home. out of the question.  it's much worse than that.  what do you mean worse.   nice job, einstein.  sorry, guys, i thought it was supposed to be green spots, blue tongues, not the other way around.  they can't keep us in here forever.  please remain calm.  we've got the best experts in the country flying in right now.  ..  i hope.  they're so young, so young.  man, look at all those kids.  i sure wish i was out there with them.  same here, man.  same here.  captions paid for by abc cable networks group  everybody.  pay attention to me.  for a change.  ..ahem..  as you all know, the king is due back from his meeting with the fish heads of state.  i want everything in tiptop shape when he gets home.  you announce his arrival.  you're in charge of decorations.  ..  not on the refreshment committee.  ..  make sure the trumpets are in tune.      dismissed.  oh. sebastian.  what are you doing on the king's throne.  aah.  ..never mind, flounder.  help me hang these decorations if you're looking for work.  actually, i'm looking for ariel.  she's seahorse riding.  ..  good morning.  she's got say good morning to every creature in the whole ocean.      morning, ariel. morning, ariel.  good morning, sea slugs.  .. 101...  .. 102...  .. 103...  morning, ariel.  have a great day.  .. 106...  .. 107...  uhhh.  ..  it's one of them.  shoo. go away.  they cause bad luck.  that's what the legend says, and legends are never wrong.  so my last three spells blew up in my face.  this time, bad luck better not mess with me.  ha ha ha ha ha.   with one wave of my hand    you'll know who's in command    i'm the quintessential queen of sorcery    i keep a potion in my purse    that's worse than any curse    no, you wouldn't want to mess with me    take a barracuda's nose    and a dozen turtle toes    add the venom of a sea anemone    eye of urchin, crab of louis    stir the goop until it's gooey    that's my favorite rancid recipe    no, you wouldn't want to mess with me    ) )
