 serve it, would you.  whatever you say.   those were the fun times, but now as king, i'm prevented from prankstering.   such acts would be unseemly.  it's a good thing you retired that title because my man t.j.  would have taken it away.  no contest. first round.  i'm willing to bet here is a better prankster than you ever were.  i second that bet.  ..  sire.  and do you have the guts to support such an outlandish statement.  um, well sure, he does.  the only way to prove he's worthy of the title is to do exactly as i did he must pull a practical joke on the reigning king.  if you can pull a prank on me by the end of school tomorrow, the title and this amusing cap is yours.  but if you fail, your punishment will be one week as my fanner boy.  wow. a week off.  gee, maybe i shouldn't.  you got yourself a deal.   , you took on the king.  that was brave.  brave nothing.  that title belongs to the teej, and that cap is sweet.  my female intuition tells me that perhaps t.j.  has mixed feelings about this wager.  yeah, right. t.j.'s ready to rock 'n' roll, aren't you, teej.  it's not that i don't appreciate the support.  i'm not sure i can pull it off.  gretchen: absolutely.  no doubt.  ..  ..  and, lest we forget, you've got the prankster heart.  well, what are we waiting for.  let's get prankin'.  take me to my fountain.  he's coming.  king bob is coming.  quick, pretend to

dad's.  if anything happened to it, he'd have me courtmartialed.  i borrowed it without asking.  it sure is a beauty.  yep, and all original the paint, the propeller.  heck, i bet the string is 30 years old.  no, the plane.  what am i going to do.  you can buy your dad a new one.  you don't understand.  i can't buy him a new one.  it's a handmade miniature from guam.  there is one person who may find you a replacement.  who's that.  the hustler kid.  what you have here, my friend, is the string of a 125th scale model of the modified p54 lightning, made of balsam wood found in the forests of guam.  i'll see what i can do.  even if he could track down one of those planes, it would take weeks to get here, maybe months.  is this what you're looking for.  it's an exact duplicate.  but how did you find it.  how are you going to pay for it.  i got this stuff.  good, glue it together and hope it flies, 'cause you ain't getting this plane for that junk.  i'll do anything for it, anything.  okay, tell you what.  i'll let you have the plane, but you got to work for me.  oh, thank you, mr. hustler kid, sir.  yeah, yeah, just remember, tomorrow at recess, you report to me, and, kid, wear working clothes.  where's the pea. show me.  where's the little pea.  pleasure doing business.  here's your s'mores, hustler kid.  10 cases of wingerdingers for 3 cases of yazoos.  all right, 10 cases of wingerdingers for one case of yazoos, but throw in a box of caramel cubes to sweeten the deal.  don't you think hustler kid can get his own lunch.  hey, h.k.'s a busy kid.  butterscotch pudding, please, and could you take out the lumps.  h.k.'s got a thing about lumps.  it was terrible terrible.  i was just walking home from school, minding my own business, when some creeps agnew middle school jumped me and stole all my marbles.  that's tough.  they were my grandpa's marbles.  he'd been saving them since the depression.  there were six pearlies, a couple of steelies, and even a cat's eye.  i can't pay you for them or nothing, but if you could just see your way to give me some replacement marbles, it would mean so much to my grandpa.  i got my first marbles from my old man's old man.  i'll give you some marbles.  it's the least i could do.  it won't bring grandpa's steelies back, but thanks, hustler.  but, hustler kid, look.  gee, how did those get there.  you little snitch.  you were trying to cheat me.  i think i hear miss finster calling.  you saved me from a chump's move.  just returning the favor, h.k.  i could use a guy like you in my organization.  what are you doing tomorrow morning.  eating a balanced breakfast.  cancel the flapjacks, buddy boy.  we got bigger fish to fry.  .  you'll see.  wow, what is this, some kind of secret hustler kid headquarters.  not for long, you keep yapping your trap like that.  fan 'em this way, your basic deck.  fan 'em that way, all aces.  all: ooh.  wow, this place has everything.  .  fingers, my man.  is that your boy.  meet fingers maloy.  fingers is the best in the biz.  taught me everything i know, from the hustler kids' code of honor to making customer satisfaction job one.  job two.  oh, yeah, personal satisfaction is job one.  so what do you got for me.  some new candy tofu crunchy cremes fell of a truck in jersey.  this stuff's an insult to sugar.  i'll take them.  i don't get it.  why did you buy all those yucky candies.  'cause they were cheap.  let me explain something.  there's two types of people in the world players and chumps.  we're the players, and the kids we sell these to they're chumps.  the things taste terrible.  you're going to convince them they don't.  wow, these tofu crunchy cremes are the best candy ever.  mmmmmmmmm, they're just bursting with kidlicious excitement.  hey, i'm a kid.  give me.  touch, kid.  that was amazing.  i felt so alive, so alert, so necessary.  i could do this every recess.  oh, you will. you will.  together: scandalicious.  ah, from serf to salesman i tell you, anything can happen in my kingdom.   hey, gus, can we talk.  sure, what do you need, guys.  we're worried.  all you do is hustle.  yeah, what happened to the pathetic pushover kid we used to love and respect so much.  you guys are right.  now that i look at it your way, i see what i've become.  i hate myself.  it's okay, gus.  we just want you to stop so we can all be friends again.  you still want to be friends.  i'll do it.  i'll stop hustling.  what am i going to do with all these crunchy cremes.  if i don't sell them, i'll have to work for hustler kid again.  we can pay for them, right, guys.  oh, no, you shouldn't.  i'm overwhelmed.  guys, we helped out a friend in need, and we're all somewhat richer for the experience.  some of us more than others, chumps.   counterfeit hall passes, huh.   they're real good.  now get rid of them.  what are you talking about.  i don't want nothing to do with them because it's against the hustler kid code.  we never hustle anything that could get a kid in trouble.  a kid could get detention like that.  as long as we turn a profit, who cares.  don't spread it around, but i do.  get those out of my sight.  no.  what did you say.  this stuff is perfectly good merchandise, and i'm selling it.  you do that, gus, and we're through.  , i thought you were a player, but i was wrong.  it turns out you're just another chump.   remember, tykes, always come to the gustler kid.  what do i hear for a genuine teacher's answer book.   , it's just business.   get your all day gum here.  guaranteed to last from breakfast till bath.  gus said he was going to quit.  he lied to us.  i've tried that gum.  it doesn't match label claims.  was that who i think it was.  mikey: hustler kid.  the name's francis, but don't spread it around.  heck, spread it around.  it's all over.  gus drove me out of business.  what happened.  the rules changed.  i taught gus everything but proper respect for the code.  we want our friend back, and you want your business.  how can we make this happen.  i'm a loser.  last deal i made was for this box of defective paddle toys.  look at these things lousy strings so short, no selfrespecting kid would play with them.  a moron could do it.  actually, mikey's got a point.  this is really quite entertaining.  say, francis, you thinking what i'm thinking.  call me hustler.  hey, lasalle, what are you doing
