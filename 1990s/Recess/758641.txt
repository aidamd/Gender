you don't understand.  stewart's not just a cat.  he's a living being.  he's got rights and feelings just like we do.   just because he's small and we're big doesn't mean we have the right to treat him like a toy.  we ought to be ashamed of ourselves, dressing him up like a doll, chasing him, even trying to eat him.  but we not eat kitty.  we feed him.  we love kitty.  oh, well, that changes everything.  hank, move the dumpster.  no.    well, i'll be.   look kittens.  what do you know.  stewart's a stella.  what. kittens.  i don't understand.  there was just one, and now there's move aside.  prickly, we're with animal control.  it's about time.  been a busy day, pops.  where's this rabid feline.  you can't do this.  that filthy creature agitated my work, destroyed school property, and put the whole student body at risk of catscratch fever.  and.  he jumped over that fence behind the ball diamond.  now go get him.  we ain't jumping no fences.  if he's gone, he's gone.  come on, lars.  it's doughnut time.  don't just stand there, finster.  these kittens need milk.  hank, have we got some old blankets.  the poor little things look cold.  yay.  yay.  yay.  well, guys, it couldn't have turned out any better than this.  since the vet says the kittens are old enough to be weaned, those little stewarts and stellas will never be lonely again.  muffin, you are so totally an autumn, just like me.  does mommy wuv her wittle baby.  oh, yes, she does.  look at this little guy.  he's a genius, i tell you a little genius.  don't worry, girl.  they're all going to nice homes.  especially you.  you're coming with me.   well, okay, but just this once.    stop it. that hurts.  ooh. ahh. aah. ooh.    why.why.  king bob, you've got to stop the madness.  no. let them continue.  it amuses me.  ow. ow.  my arm. my arm.  sorry, man.  you okay.  uhh. uhh.  halt. stop the contest.  you pulled a fakeout.  that violates the no fakingout law as instituted by king wally.  king who.  ..  from five years ago when i was in first grade.  doesn't anyone remember king wally.  i don't think so.  short kid, red hair, ruled with an iron fist.  between king al and king chuck.  al. chuck. who are they.  it was under the chuckianic code that kindergartners were granted full rights on the playground.  king al hammered out the international laws for slaughter ball, protecting the human rights of every kid.  how could you forget them.   there were other kings.  i never knew that.  nobody remembers wally or chuck or al.  don't feel bad, your highness.  after all, you're the king now.  but those guys were great kings.  they changed recess forever.  and if no one remembers them, why would anyone ever remember me.  this is the fertile nile delta, a narrow strip of green surrounded by desert.  here arose the most powerful empire of the ancient world the egyptians.  their ruler was the pharaoh, an allpowerful king whom the people considered a god.  but the pharaohs had one problem how could they make sure they'd never be forgotten.  the answer they built these the great pyramids which we still marvel at today.  because of these great monuments, the pharaohs will be remembered forever.  ..  ..forever.  after over 4,000 years, we still know their names ..  bob.  gathering of the grades.  move it, you kids. let's go.  i don't like the sound of this.  king bob hasn't called a gathering of the grades since he instituted the gum tax.  don't remind me.  every time i buy a pack, it's four pieces for him and one for me.  kids of the playground, i have decided to undertake the most ambitious project in the history of the playground to build a pyramid as a monument to me and my benevolence.  huh.  what's benevolence.  he's gotta be kidding.  it's an interesting idea.  throughout history, people have sought immortality through great public works like mount rushmore ..  or those giant dinosaurs they built by the freeway.  the more i hear about this, the more i like it.  the building of this pyramid marks the beginning of king bob's reign of a thousand semesters.  every kid will need to help.  we'll need a master builder someone with brain power, someone with superior knowledge of physics and engineering, ..  gretchen grundler.  me, your majesty.  you.  my own pyramid. wow.  i'd like every book you have on ancient egypt.  again.  i haven't read them over since first grade.  the ideal building material is limestone, but by the time we quarry the stones, drag them here, build the pyramids, you'll be approximately, well, 143 years old.  there must be a faster way.  we could make the bricks out of mud, but mud it is.  so shall it be written, so shall it be done.   man, this is a blast digging in the mud, making bricks.  there's nothing like getting good and filthy.  i'm not supposed to get my school clothes messed up.  do what i do, gus turn your clothes inside out.  your mom will never know.  i'm hungry.  i'm tired.  my back hurts.  it's been four days.  it's time for a break.  how about a little kickball.  yeah.  yeah.  yeah.  well, your majesty, according to my schedule, by the end of recess today, we should be ..here.  where are my workers.  i think they're over there, your highness.  this is an outrage.  what about my pyramid.  if we don't stay on schedule, we won't finish until you're in junior high.  they'll just have to get back to work.  it's more complicated than that.  the workers are volunteers.  if they don't feel like working i'll make them work.  yesterday you slackers shirked responsibilities, playing kiddie games while the pyramid remained unbuilt.  well, we are not amused.  from now on, there will be zero tolerance for anyone found playing instead of working.  from this day forward, we shall no longer be called king bob, but instead, pharaoh bob the first, the magnificent.   so shall it be written, so shall it be done.  uhoh.   uhh.  aah.  aah.  aah.    oh, man, this really womps.  if i get my school clothes muddy one more time, i'm grounded for a week.  maybe gretchen could help us.  she's so into this pyramid thing, she's forgotten who we are.  let's go.  speed it up, you slackers.  you got to talk to her, teej.  hey, you, watch that keystone.  you two, get more grass in those bricks.  gretchen, can we talk to you for a minute.  i'm pretty busy right now.  watch that primitive lever.  gretchen, we're all exhausted.  no one saidkids will be talking about this when we're in ninth, maybe tenth grade.  think of it as a labor of love.  hey, that's not how you use a fulcrum.  labor of love.  yeah, right.  love for her, labor for us.  boy: you lot, back to work.  aah. my new shirt.  hey, get to work.  my mom's gonna kill me.  aw, too bad.  now start digging.  all right, that's it.  hey, you.  leave my friend alone.  who's gonna make me.  i am.  why, you little i'm telling king bob on you.  that'spharaohbob, you maroon.  .  .  .  i've had enough of this, haven't you.  enough of working under the sun.  enough of digging mud and making bricks.  we get 40 precious minutes of recess a day.  i am gonna spend them the way i want. who's with me.  no more mud.  pharaoh bob's a dud.  all: no more mud.  pharaoh bob's a dud.  no more mud.  pharaoh bob's a dud.  oh, the sound of happy workers.  say, what is that song they're singing, anyway.  it's kind of catchy.  i don't think that's a song, your highness.  there's a rebellion.  well, quell it.  do i have to do everything.  no more work.  pharaoh bob's a jerk.  in the name of pharaoh bob, i order you to halt. hey.  get 'em.   ..12.  we've had enough.  bring out the hose.  the hose on your own people.  if anyone understands your dream, it's me.  the kids have made it clear we've gone too far.  nonsense.  get the hose now.  that's it. i quit.  fine. henchman.  be sure to get the master builder really wet.  spinelli, watch the left flank.  vince, go help those third graders.  where's the best mud.  gretchen, i knew you wouldn't let us down.  gus: look.  it's the hose.  ready, aim, fire.  for liberty.  why, you little hey, was that a raindrop.  hey, it's raining.  yeah, it is.  look, the pyramid.  oh, my gosh.  it's, like, melting.  my pyramid. no.  i tried to tell you you shouldn't build a pyramid out of mud.  my legacy.  my crowning achievement.  it was supposed to last a thousand semesters, and now it's gone, all gone.  i just wanted to be remembered.  i know, bob, but great leaders aren't remembered for the things they've built.  they're remembered for the things they do.  do you recall the time gus got stuck in that tree, and you organized a ladder to get him down.  not really.  how about the time the ashleys got in that fashion fight, and you served as judge to restore peace.  yeah.  those are the things you're going to be remembered for, not because of some giant mound of mud.  maybe you're right.  but it's too late now.  i've failed my subjects.  they'll never follow me again.  trust the kids, bob.  give them back their recess, and they'll return to you.  hmm. trust the kids.  it's so crazy, it just might work.  kids of the playground, i come before you to explain why i've been acting so nuts lately.  i wanted you to remember me after i was gone.  but what use is it being remembered if your subjects didn't even like you to begin with.  anyhow, i guess i just got carried away.  and, well, what i'm trying to say is i'm sorry.  sorry.sorry.  after enslaving us and making us work in the hot sun and sending your guards on us with that big hose.  why should we forgiveyou.  i'll repeal the gum tax.  all hail king bob.  yay.  yay.  yay.  i proclaim that no pyramid shall ever be built on this playground again.  and i will no longer be known as pharaoh bob but simply as regular old king bob.  and no more of this referring to myself in the first person plural.  no more forcing kids to do stuff they don't want to do.  so shall it be written, so shall it be aw, heck, just have fun.  captions paid for by abc cable networks group captions made possible bythe disney channel look at them pearls.  wow. i've got to have them pearls.  but you never go anyplace classy enough to wear pearls.  i don't want to wear 'em.  i just want 'em, see.  oh, yeah. i know that.  announcing the count and countess of columbeboque.  ah, my good friends.  how long has it been.  the last time we saw you, your hair was still red.  and you were not yet a father.  is this ariel.  the last time i saw you, you were no bigger than a minnow.  come look at the twins, ariel.  my, what perfect little angel fish.  tonight, i shall conduct the rite of passage ceremony for your mertwins.  but first, how about a tour of atlantica.  sounds like an ocean of fun.  but we have no babysitter.  i'll take care of them.  why, ariel, that would be wonderful.  ariel, babysitting is hard work.  and that's just with one baby.  oh, daddy, i can do it.  they'll be no trouble at all.  ha ha ha.  ariel, what is going on here.  oh, just babysitting, sebastian.  ah, the clam babies are twins.  ariel, this is no way to handle babies.  you must use the child psychololigy.  use a gentle voice, the caring claw, koocheekoocheecoo.  koocheekoocheekoocheecoo.  ha ha. see. i know how to handle babies.  stop it. hahahaha. babies. babies. no.  keep an eye on them, mr. expert.  i'll get some of my old toys for them

nearly exploded.  i've been watching babies since i was a baby.  what a cure crab child i was.  with my little claws and big eyes.  how are things going with the children.  just fine.  notice how quiet they are.  aaah. they're gone.  excuse me. i'm looking for twin merbabies.  have you seen them.  yeah. they look like this.  only cuter.  oh, it's all my fault.  don't blame yourself, ariel.  you're right, sebastian.  you're the one who lost them.  me.  you were the babysitter.  yeah, but you said you were a baby expert.  well, you were the one who listened to me.  hey, boss, if we get ahold of those twins, we can force their mother to give us her pearls.  hey, i got an idea.  if i get ahold of those twins, i can force their mother to give me her pearls.  how do i think of these things.  that's what makes you the boss, boss.  this'll give me a chance to use the new secondhand bubble gun i just took over in the marketplace.  does it work.  it works.  and here is the atlantica marketplace.  very impressive.  oh, the children would love this.  i hope they're getting along alright with ariel.  i'm sure everything's going swimmingly. ) )
