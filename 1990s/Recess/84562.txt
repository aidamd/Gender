"just as much chance of winning as the next class".  where do they come up with this stuff.  i don't know, guys.  maybe all we got to do is give it a shot.  thereisa statistical chance we could win.  the ashleys are just kids like us, right.  .  put a little elbow grease in it, ashley t.  these cans won't move themselves.  we're doomed.  i don't know if i can handle losing to the ashleys.  maybe we don't have to.  what do you mean.  maybe we should just bow out of the race.  if we don't compete, we can't lose.  sounds good to me.  all those in favor " aye.  aye.  miss grotke's class is officially out nay.  what did you say.  nay. nay and nay again.  mikey, it's a sucker's bet.  wecan'twin.  you don't do a can drive to win.  you do it for the reasons principal prickly said to help the homeless, the hungry, et cetera.  if you want to be in the can drive, more power to you.  the rest of us aren't up for it.  each soul must follow his own path, and my path is cans.  au revoir, mes amis.  poor misguided simpleton.  he doesn't stand a chance.  let the can drive begin.  poor guy.  he looks so pathetic.  you just can't compete with the ashleys.  let's cheer him up.  how's our cancollecting buddy doing.  oh, uh, okay.  you should be proud.  nobody's ever collected that many cans against the ashleys.  there's no shame in quitting now.  quitting. i'm not quitting.  i'm doing great.  in fact, i thought you guys were ready to join me.  are you off your nut.  they're creaming you, man.  i told you guys i don't care about that stuff.  i'm doing this for the betterment of mankind.  i think the ashleys share that spirit.  if it isn't the candrive king himself.  what are you doing, getting advice on how to lose from your noncollecting subjects.  hey, give the guy a break.  he's working, unlike you weasels who get your moms and dads to buy the cans for you.  ooh, that, like, really hurts.  it means a lot coming from dorks who can't handle competition.  you perfumeheaded powder puffs, we could beat you any day of the week.  like you did for the last five years.  you're going to make us do something we don't want to do.  ooh, i'm, like, quivering in my $90 pumps.  we're in.  this is war.  we're going to crush you so bad, the only thing left will be broken green beans and a smeared streak of creamed corn.  ...  see you losers at the finish line, if you, like, even make it that far.  ..  well, guys, we sure collected a lot of cans.  it's amazing what two days of collecting and five years of humiliation can do for you.  there's no way the ashleys can catch up.  next.  they're cancollecting machines.  but that's okay, guys.  we're just doing this for those less fortunate, right.  there's got to be a way to catch up.  if only we had more kids to help us.  we need your help.  sorry.  no, thanks.  nah.  nah.  we're going to beat the ashleys.  the ashleys.  we're in.  ashleys. count me in.  ashleys. sounds cool.  guys, it's a whole new can drive.  and so columbus made his first atlantic crossing in the year 1492.  can you believe how many cans of food we collected.  we're really going to help a lot of people.  and kick a lot of ashley butt, too.  i don't know, you guys.  based on my calculations, it's going to be pretty darn close.  we got to beat them.  we just got to.  as part of our thanksgiving candrive celebration, we have a special guest here to present the winning class with its turkey feast finkelstein, a graduate of third street school's first class back in 1928.  okay, very nice, eudora.  now just sit there and hold the turkey.  anyway, without further ado, the envelopes, please.  ..  miss furley's class 4,362.  yes. yes.  in your face.  in your face.  ..  4,362.   it's, like, a tie.  that's perfect.  a tie's worse than losing.   oh, man, if we had just one more can, one more can.  you kids say you need one more can.  well, i think i may have one in here.  i was going to give it to the winning class, ..   i've got it.  ow. you're hurting me.   don't you see what's happening.  you're all acting like animals.  can drives aren't about winning or losing.  they're about helping people and being generous.  who wins and who loses matters not, so let's just put all the cans together and forget about that dumb turkey dinner.  what do you say.  there's only one thing to say give me that can.  eee. oh. eee. aah.   the pyramid. no.   look out.  she's going to blow.   look what you've all done.  now nobody's going to have a good thanksgiving.  hey, where is everybody.  mikey.  he's in here, you guys.  where have you been.  we've been, like, looking all over for you.  you have. but why.  'cause we felt bad about yesterday.  we wanted to make things right, but we couldn't figure out how.  then it came to us.  it was ashley a's idea.  we all came up with it.  what are you talking about.  this.  boy: here you go, mikey.  here you go, man.  but i don't get it.  i thought we drained the whole neighborhood.  we did, but then we started working as a team.  we came up with a bunch of new ideas.  i called my cousin nick over at fifth street school.  and we talked to the diggers society.  and there's a convention of swingers in town.  we collected twice as many cans as we had before.  and that's not all, mikey. look.  when we told the guy at the feedbin store what happened, he said it was time his company put its money where its mouth is.  they're donating a truckload of food to every homeless shelter in the city.  it's all because of you, mikey.  thanks to you, we realize that working with each other is twice as good as working against each other.  your attention, please.  now that the thanksgiving can drive is over, i want to remind everyone that monday is the beginning of our holiday toy drive, so collect, collect, collect.  that is all.   captions paid for by abc cable networks group he's coming home.  who, daddy.  apollo, hero of the sargasso wars.  sebastian, we must do something special for the great apollo.  well, we most certainly will, your majesty.  ..  a welcome home apollo speech.  ..  a parade.  we learned about apollo in history class.  apollo is our greatest hero.  he was my most trusted sea warrior back before you or any of your sisters were born.  the octopins who lived beyond the sargasso sea wanted to drive the merpeople from atlantica.  you're not from the sea.  the octopins wanted our space, our crops, our culture.  watch out.  swim for your lives.  they had somehow acquired a trident as powerful as mine.  apollo was wise.  he hid among the sargasso weeds overhead, awaiting his chance.  the battle was won, and apollo became a hero. ) )
