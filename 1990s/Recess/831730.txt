 cover me.  i'm going in.   miss finster, how nice to see you.  detweiler, we meet again.   miss finster: let's look at a boy who seems to enjoy breaking school rules, a boy who scrawled crude chalk caricatures on principal prickly's door, and now this pilfering food from the cafeteria kitchen.  what do you suppose we should do with a boy this bad.  say, i have an idea no recess.   why doesn't she just tear out his soul.   miss finster, miss finster, those girls over there said a bad word.  good boy, randall.  here's a cookie.   psst, t.j.  hey, guys.  how you holding out.  keeping busy, but there is one thing i'd like you guys to do for me.  what's that.  get me out of here.  i'm going crazy in here, you guys.  i've counted the ceiling tiles 13 times already.  there's 1,678.  do you hear me.  1,678.  don't worry, t.j.  we're with you, man.  yeah, no matter what happens, we're all in this together.  hey, what are you kids doing there.  see ya.  you guys, come back.  he's really losing it in there.  a kid without recess it's too horrible for words.  i say we bust him out.  an admirable suggestion, spinelli, but based on my calculations, any attempt of rescue has a 70% likelihood of failure.  hey, i got an idea.  let's go ask the guru kid.  oh, great guru kid, our friend has been thrown into detention, and we know not what to do.  consider the bumblebee.  alone he is worth nothing, but with his fellow bees, he becomes a swarm and enjoys bountiful quantities of honey.  what's that supposed to mean.  don't you see.  we're the bee.  alone, ..  actually, he may have something there.  if we were able to get all of the other kids on the playground to help us, our likelihood of success increases 10% to 15%.  what are we waiting for.  let's go.  thanks, guru kid.  oh, great guru kid, how can i get an "a" on my spelling test.  consider the bumblebee.  ..  let me get this straight.  you want me and sam to dig under the lunchroom, break through the floor, out just so he can have recess.  um, yeah, that's about the size of it.  neat.  neat.  see, i told you these guys are good.  sam: hey, dave, you're digging the wrong way.  dave: what are you, crazy.  who are you calling crazy, stupid.  stupid.  i'll show you stupid.   they're not going to help us, are they.  not in a million years.  all: swing, swing, swing, swing.  the swinger's always up for a new adventure.  what's she doing now.  trying to go over the top of the swing set, to boldly go where no kid has gone before.  great, but will she help us.  sure.  swinger: aah.   as soon as she gets back from the nurse.  i can't believe we're going to talk to kindergartners.  no one else will help us.  i've been studying these primitive grades for some time now, and i think i can communicate with them.  follow me.  hello, kindergartners.  we have come from the land of the big kids across the wide playground to ask your help.  i'm going to try the aluminum foil.  look, shiny metal.  do you like the shiny metal.  if you help us, we'll give you the shiny metal.  what do you say, kindergartners.  let's eat 'em.  run.  i don't want to see him, vince.  i'm scared.  bob's king of the playground.  if he helps, the other kids will follow.  he better help, or he's going to meet my friend madam fist.  dealing with a kid of bob's stature takes finesse, not brawn, so let me do the talking, okay.  o great king bob, overseer of the playground, vizier of the jungle gym, we come to ask your royal favor.  you see, my liege, our best friend t.j.  was caught by the finster.  we got to bust him out.  hey, get that first grader off of my sand.  hey, leave me alone.  what i'm trying to say here, your highness, is that we can't do it alone.  yeah, we really, really need your help.  you hear that.  the fourth graders need my help.  ha ha ha.  ha ha ha.  of course you need my help.  everyone needs my help.  i'm the king.  great.  so you'll help us.  i didn't say that.  you see, being king of the playground is a heavy responsibility.  i make sure the first graders don't get too uppity.  i make sure us sixth graders are treated with respect.  i can't be helping every kid with every problem.  my royal mind is just too busy.  you understand. too busy.  but, your majesty i've got better things to do than worry about some dumb kid.  some dumb kid.  who does he think he is calling t.j. "some dumb kid".  now, spinelli, you promised.  you sit on your sixthgrade butt ruling over the playground like some sort of big shot.  let me tell you something, playground king you'renothing but some dumb kid.  she didn't mean that, your highness.  i have to concur with my violent friend.  gretchen.  i mean, technically, she is correct.  bob is dumb, and he is a kid.  yeah, and if you think about it, we're all just some dumb kid to somebody in this crazy, mixedup universe.  my big brother thinks i'm some dumb kid.  my mom called me "some dumb kid" this morning.  even you've been called "some dumb kid" at some time or another, right, mr. king bob, sir.  so next time you go around calling a guy "some dumb kid," just remember this you're one, too.  and let's face it, bob, if us dumb kids don't stand up for each other, who will.  the midget girl's right.  kids of the playground, the dumb kid should be freed.    1, 2, 6, 10.  1, 2, 6, 10.  1, 2, 6, 10.  uhh. it's jammed.  stand back.  i've got just the stuff tomato surprise.  i'm free. i'm free.  , what are you doing out there.  what are you guys doing in there.  miss finster: that's my question, but since you seem so eager to return to the classroom, you'll be happy to learn that recess will be over ..  now.   no. no.  no.  , we did our best.  sorry we didn't get to you in time.  you guys did something most kids wouldn't even try.  you're the best friends a guy could ever have.  thanks, teej.  it was a relatively entertaining recess.  we had upside down girl, the swinger, the diggers hey, whatever happened to the diggers anyway.  okay, t.j., we're here.  hey, wait a minute.  this isn't our school.  uh, dave, do those kids look like kindergartners to you.  come on, little guy.  i don't get it.  i've been waiting three whole days, and my little plant just won't grow.  hey, did you remember to put the seed in.  oops.  everybody know the plan.  good. then let's do it.  miss grotke, miss grotke.  do we have a problem with our assignment.  i'm clear on the postulate of light and no light.  i'm more interested in the effects of nitrogenenriched soil.  well, uh, gee, uh, i don't know.  or perhaps a richer fertilizer like a nitrophosphorous blend.  i've also heard ..   ..  recess already.  i must be having trouble with my inner clock.  oh, well.  class dismissed.  miss grotke, lieutenant griswald, usmc, reporting to deploy my son.  deploy.  my boy gustav has been assigned to your class.  any guy named gustav is bound to be trouble.  we're always happy to welcome a new student to our circle of friends.  where is gustav.  private, report.  that's gustav.  well, my duty here is done.  miss grotke, boys and girls.  welcome to our little classroom family, gustav.  why don't you

can we go to recess now.  why, certainly.  excuse me, but isn't it kind of early for recess.  it's part of our daily ritual.  we always go to recess at 10:00.  but it's only i'll show you around.  darn solar watches.  i'm going to stop buying out of the whole planet catalog.  now over there is the jock section.  you could get a nasty wedgie if you catch them in a bad mood.  , can i speak to you in private.  you guys introduce gus to the bugeating kid.  you're not even supposed to talk to a kid like him.  a kid like him.  what do you mean.  you know, a new kid.  i'm not going to say anything.  the rest of the class isn't going to say anything.  who's going to know.  over there is where they keep the kindergartners.  you wouldn't want to go over there.  last kid who wandered over there, they never saw him again.   it's all right.  he might have just got transferred.  no, it's not that.  i've been to 12 schools in 6 years, and nobody's ever been so nice to me before.  it's so beautiful.  there, there, little guy.  things are different now.  here you'll always have friends.   sixth graders.  who who's that.  king bob.  just act real humble.  don't say you're a halt. who are

no.  look at the bright side.  lots of people have gone through life without names, and they've done fine.  oh, yeah. like who.  well, like the artist formerly known as prince, the unknown soldier, the other four guys in the jackson five.  i might as well face it.  i'm nothing but a loser, a kid with no name.  even my snake won't look me in the eye anymore.  see you guys later, if i don't shrivel up and blow away first.  dust in the wind all we are is dust in the wind.  that kid is really starting to bug me.  how would you feel if they took away your name.  rules or no rules, i wish we could help the guy.  maybe wecanhelp him.  what are you .  maybe we can give him back his name.  i got some favors i can call in.  a lot of kids would do it for nothing.  he'll never be the new kid

watch me.  all my life i've been treated like a nobody, ignored by kids because they didn't know me, given the worst stuff because everybody else got there first, made to eat paste.  just because i was the new kid.  then i come to this school, and for the first time, a bunch of kids treat me like a friend.  then you came along and made me a nobody again.  well, you listen here, bob.  who graduated and made you king.  i am not a nobody.  i am a somebody.  i am gus p. griswald.  you hear me.  gus p. griswald.  so what's your point.  well, i want my name back.  that's my point.  okay,
