the playground just isn't the same when teej is in detention.  in his absence, we average a startling four fewer laughs per recess.  look, i like teej as much as the next kid, but it's recess and we have to have fun.  boy: yeah.  all right.  last time i checked, video games were fun.  left. go. no.  oh, yeah. jump.  gordie, what you got.  latest version of ducks on a pond.  it's a total quackup.  yes. i'm unflappable.  hey, can i try.  sure, but be warned it's challenging.  watch the lily pads.  they're booby traps.  stay away from the hunter.  wow, you're pretty good.  hey, it's a game, isn't it.  too bad t.j. isn't here.  he'd get quite a kick.  ye, it's a real shame.  what's that supposed to mean.  well, let's just say detweiler isn't as popular as he thinks.  that's not a very funny joke, gordie.  who's joking.  are you actually suggesting .  do i need to spell it out with math.  me minus t.j. equals good.  get it.  gee, a kid .  i never thought i'd see the day.    ahh.  teej, you're out.  was there ever any question.  no, but here's a question what did you do to gordie.  gordie from our class.  nothing. why.  he says he doesn't like you.  mikey, never kid a kid who hasn't had his recess.  he's not kidding, teej.  gordie just told us.  he spelled it out in math.  this hasbe some sort of mistake.  where is that gordie guy.   guess you'll have to see him in class.  yeah, i guess i will.  although they were both founding fathers, john adams and thomas jefferson did not always get along.  jefferson thought adams was a stuffy bostonian who liked big government.  adams thought jefferson was a knowitall showoff who didn't do anything but build his house and get up at 3:00.  psst, pass it down.  both of those gentlemen might have benefited from counseling, but, alas, they were born too soon, although i sometimes wonder if even a good counselor wouldn't have been w who didn't think twice about excluding an entire gender.  where were the founding mothers.  unbelievable.  right on, t.j.    so, kickball or soccer.  anything but maul ball.  i still got a wedgie.  why must we compete.  are there no games without winners and losers.  a game presupposes winners and losers, mikey.  otherwise, it wouldn't be ..  snoozefest.  i vote for football.  what about you, teej.  what do you think gordie will want to play.  gordie.  he won't play with us.  he doesn't like you, remember.  we'll see about that.  hey, come on, come on, go, go.  hey, gordie, i've been hearing some talk and, well, do you like me.  nope.  oh, uh, well, thanks.  no problem.  now do you believe us.  ii can't believe it.  i won't believe it.  we all go through this, teej.  some people don't like me 'cause they can't take a loss.  some find me irritatingly bright.  and me a tad too dorky.  and me simply too heartfelt.  , there are over five billion people.  it would be impossible for all of them to like you.  but come on.  everybody likes me.  don't you think you're exaggerating.  everybody likes me, and i'll prove it.  hey, sam, dave, what do you guys think of me.  both: we dig you, man.  upsidedown girl, how would you rate me.  hey, lawson, do you like me.  of course, i like you, dirtweiler, especially when i'm kicking your keister at sports.  but, lawson, you never kick my keister at sports.  oh, yeah, but you're still an okay guy.  even my worst enemy likes me, and soon gordie will, too, or my name isn't t.j. detweiler.  boy: t.j. detweiler.  i like that guy.  hey, there, gordieo.  whatcha doing.  nothing, now that my batteries are dead.  gee, that's a mmer.  hey, how's about a game of catch.  no, thanks.  some hoops.  i'll pass.  handball.  oh, man, i love handball.  great.  hey, carl, want to play some handball.   hey, man, are you feeling okay.  it's this whole gordienotlikingme thing.  perhaps a gordieproof treat would lift your spirits.  i suppose it couldn't hurt.  man, oh, man, are these things good.  nothing says "friends forever" like a freshly baked brownie.  you know, mikey, you may have something there.  i had something there.  hey, there, gordie, old pal.  uh, yeah, hey.  mmm, boy, these are some delectable brownies.  did you say brownies.  yep, all chocolatey and soft and chewy.  want to try one.  well, maybe just one.  mmm, these brownies are uh, do these brownies have nuts in them.  yep, nothing but the best for my pal.  oh, yuck.  i'm allergic to nuts.  detweiler, just 'cause i don't like you is no reason to poison me.  but, gordie, ..   gordie's not that good in science.  i could tutor him.  but, uh, teej, you're not good in science either.  but gretchen could tutor me, then i could tutor gordie.  this is getting weird, teej.  it's like the more gordie dislikes you, the more you want him to like you.  people always seem to want the things they cannot have.  the things they cannot have, huh.  guys, you just gave me an idea. excuse me.  look, gordie, i didn't want to have to tell you this, but i think it's only fair that you know i don't like you either.  you you don't.  no, i do not.  whew.  oh, what a relief.  now you don't have to invite me to your birthday party next year.  man, this notbeingliked stuff is the worst.   worse than being stuck in detention all alone.  ha, but it's better than being stuck in detention with gordie.  wait a second.  that's it.  tomorrow, i'm winning me a friend.  what, exactly, are we waiting for.  beats me.  said to wait here until he initiates operation big trouble.  okay, all is in readiness.  when's ashley q. up.  that girl can kick.  vince: she's at the plate now.  freeze, grass stopper.  can't you read the sign.  no playing on the new grass.  what. what sign.  you just earned yourself detention, young man.  but but but but stop saying that awful word.  i'm not certain i understand, t.j.  how is getting gordie in trouble going to make him like you.  observe phase two.  gumandlitter.  miss finster, miss finster.  i got a 614.

's just you, i'll pretend it's just me, and we'll both get through this.  fine by me.  i'm used to detention.  i get through it by whistling, and since ..   stop it.  i can't take it.  thought you weren't here.  well, i am.  you probably don't want to hear about the secret passageway, either.  that's right, i what secret passageway.  the janitor's closet.  to the untrained eye, but to a seasoned professional, a gateway to another world.  are you in.  ..am i ever.  where are we going.  you'll see.  all quiet on the kitchen front.  first stop desserts and frozen treats.  whoa. ice cream bars.  and look this one's labeled "nut free".  we aim to please, but eat up, gordie.  there's a lot more stops on the tour.  i just don't understand why every principal in the district has been honored with the pally award but me.  yes, but principal edwards has been honored three times.  i know he's the mayor's brotherinlaw, but i got his honor frontrow seats when the ice dandies were in town.  ..  yes, miss lemon.  ature on this rug i mean, requisition.   hey, guys.  all: gandor primulan, j.t.  what news do you bring.  no news, knarf, just more detention.  knarf.
