possibilities.  miss lemon, get me district headquarters.   all: ha ha ha.  come on, ashleys.  let's, like, find another window.   come.  let's go see the notalker.  why don't you speak, little boy.

one way or another.   ashleys: ha ha ha.  scandalous.  who would have thought that one little jinx could be so much fun.  let's see how long we can keep it going.  all: ha ha ha.  so that's it the ashleys jinxed him.  cruel fiends.  we've got to get to gus and say his name before it's too late.  he's a kook.  he's a rebel.  he's a man all man.  gus.  gus.  let's try the other door.  okay, move

say my name.  well, what do you know.  another jinxed kid.  that's the third one this week.  let him go, fred.  he's completely disrupted my entire school, and you people are just going to let him go.  hey, lighten up, prickly.  yeah, it's part of the kids' unwritten code of honor.  come on, fred, ..  doughnut.  doughnut.  jinx. ha ha.  jinx. ha ha.  this is ridiculous.   you mean, you did this all because you were jinxed.  yeah, kind of dumb, wasn't it.  dumb.  no, it was cool.  you're an even bigger hero than we thought.  kids: jinx boy. jinx boy.  jinx boy. jinx boy.  you know, for a timid guy, that gus sure knows what being a kid's all about.  ashley a.: ha ha ha.  well, someone was, like, bound to say his name sooner or later, but it was fun while it lasted.  yeah, let's do something like that every recess.  you thinking what i'm thinking.  definitely.  hey, you ashleys.  one of you drop 5 bucks.  ashleys:..  all: scandalous.  jinx.   boy: the few, the proud, the chosen.  we are the safety rangers of the third street school, and we're looking for a few good kids.  i'm looking for spitballs to shoot at this dweeb.  the question is are any of you prepared to accept the challenge.   to wear the orange belt of honor.  to hold high the sacred sign of safety.  and, finally, to live by the ancient bylaws of the safety rangers.  i'd like to conclude with a moving slide presentation of last year's safety ranger graduation ceremony.  could someone get the lights.  i will.   oops. sorry.  imbecile.  one blt on pita going once, going twice, and sold to the gawky kid with braces for a partially squished grilled cheese and potato chips.  : mikey. mikey.  you okay, man.  there was a double chocolate brownie up for trade and you didn't even bid.  oh, well, it's just a brownie.  all: just a brownie.  98.6 seems normal.  pulse is good.  it's just that ever since captain brad came to our class this morning, all i can think about is them.  you mean how dumb they look in their goofy uniforms.  no, i mean how much i want to wear one of those goofy uniforms.  you mean, you want to be a safety ranger. why.  if i was a safety ranger, everything would be different.  i wouldn't be just mikey.  i would be mikey the safety ranger.  i'd wear the uniform of all the great safety rangers who came before me.  i'd learn the secret hand signs.  i'd be the last line of defense between humanity and the evils of technology.  mikey, you're our hero.  children everywhere would love and adore me.  oh.   and animals, too.  it's my dream, guys, to protect and serve, to be respected by all mankind.  but who am i kidding.  it's just a fantasy.  they'd never take me.  what are you talking about, mikey.  you heard captain brad looking for a few good kids.  to be a safety ranger, you got to be cut from a special cloth.  hey, you're cut from a special cloth.  i am.  honest, loyal, hardworking you're the perfect candidate.  really.  captain brad will be thrilled you want to join up.  why, i can hear him now.  ah ha ha ha.  you, a safety ranger.  you couldn't even cross your own legs without tripping.  so is that a maybe.  that's a never.  just look at what you've done to safety stan.  he'll never be the same.  hey, pal, it's his dream.  you're that jaywalking punk anarchist.  ..  don't worry.  he doesn't have the right to say who's in and who's not.  oh, i don't, do i.  let me just show you something, baby boy.  it's the official safety rangers handbook, and according to this, i'm the guy who hands out the belts.  i'm the guy who decides which kid stands on which corner.  i'm the guy who gets to approve of who's in and who's out.  since this isn't the future dorks of america club, fat boy here is definitely out.  now if you'll excuse us, we got our morning drills to finish up.  let's go, grunts. come on.  hup2, 3, 4.  hup2, 3, 4.  hey, forget about that jerk, mikey.  yeah, it's his loss.  i know you're trying to make me feel better, but it's no use.  being a safety ranger is the only thing i ever wanted, and now it looks like my dream will never come true.  hey, mikey, i'll trade you my nuttyo's for your winger dinger.  here, just take them.  take the whole thing.  man, i've never seen him like this before.  yeah, i wish there was something we could do.  if that jerk brad says mikey can't be a safety ranger, then mikey can't be a safety ranger.  gretchen: not necessarily.  hey, where did you get that handbook.  boosted it off captain kook.  no one calls spinelli a jaywalking punk anarchist.  you ought to give that back.  okay, but i'm keeping the watch. it's quartz.  the point is, according to rule number 76j, the captain gets to pick who's in and who's out, but, according to amendment 76k, and i quote, "the captain may be overruled if a potential recruit is personally sponsored " but out of that gang of safety ranger robots, where are we going to find two guards who stand up to brad.  i think i might know just the guys.  brad: move it, you babies.  my grandmoth can march better than that.  you make me sick.  move it. move it.  more nuts.  tell us if that hot fudge starts to cool off.  nothing worse than cool hot fudge.  no, no, everything's great.  yeah, it's real nice of you to treat us to all this.  hey, you deserve it, standing out on those corners all day, crossing kids back, forth, and back and forth.  and speaking of corners, we know a guy who'd love to be a crossing guard.  yeah. who's that.  gus: our pal mikey.  do you have any idea how mad captain brad would be if we went around him.  come on, this is mikey's dream.  hey, we got a dream, too, but you don't see anybody going out on a limb for us.  suppose we could make your dream come true, then would you help us.  ..  okay, you got yourself a deal.  by the way, what is your dream.  to sing the national ..  ..  at the weekly flagraising ceremony.  we're doomed.  not necessarily.  so, you help miss lemon with the flag ceremony every week, right.  and as her helper i'm not her helper, i'm her aide.  right, and as her aide, you see the list of who gets to sing the national anthem, right.  naturally.  behind the line, please.  the counter area is for office personnel only.  well, what if next week cal and ronnie's name just happen to appear on the list.  have you lost your mind.  it's alphabetical order only.  if miss lemon ever found out i did that, she'd take away my filing privileges for life.  this is really important to us.  you do this for us, and we'll do something for you.  depends on what.  just tell us what you want and we'll take care of it.  i want to carry ashley a's books home for her after school.  she's different from the other ashleys.  that hair, the way her name sounds ashley a.  first in filing, first in my heart.  well, goodbye and good luck.  just a second.  this may be doable.  all i have to do is let him carry my books from the playground to the corner of my street.  i could cover them with plastic so he didn't touch them.  we'd wrap them ourselves.  well, then, ..no. ha ha.  haven't you ever had something that you really wanted but you couldn't have.  all: as if.  look, there is nothing we want that we don't have.  oh, my gosh, a snail.  all: ew.  okay, here's the deal.  there's nothing i want, but there is something i need.  my little sister stole my diary.  she could blackmail me forever with pages five through eight.  you get it back, and i'll let that menlo carry my books.  one little diary.  piece of cake.  where is your sister anyway.  vince: i can't believe ashley a's sister's a kindergartner.  well, she is.  we got to do it.  mikey better appreciate this.  i come from the land of the big kids who ride 2wheelers.  i seek a formal sitdown with she who goes by the name brittany.  uh, brittany a.  , you have taken your big sister's writing book and we say you have to give it back.  we'll give you candy.  we'll give you money.  aw, we'll give you anything you want.  diary very valuable.  has big price tag.  brittany a. has big dream.  she wants what.  just once, your highness.  every little kid wants to sit on a big kid's chair at some time.  but on my throne.  please, oh great king, grant this request.  we'll never bother you again.  take them to the dodgeball wall.  but, your highness, it's mikey's dream to be a safety ranger.  even you must have had a dream at some time in your life.  what.  king bob have a dream.  that's ridiculous.  that's henchmen, leave us.  but, your highness amscray.  you're right, fourth grader.  even i, the great king bob, have a dream.  once just once i wish there was somebody who liked me for what i am on the inside, not for my royal title, someone who will look past the crown and the jersey and see just bob, the kid i am underneath.  i'd give you guys anything,anything, if you could just give me a real friend.  well, might as well get this dodgeball punishment thing over with.  actually, there might be a way.  ha ha ha.   . oh, say, can you see .  .  .. .  good work, mikey.  congratulations.  way to go.  : you know, that was a good thing we did, making mikey's dream come true.  actually, we made a lot of kids' dreams come true.  but best of all, we helped a pal.  what the mikey, what are you doing here.  eating.  want a winger dinger.  you're supposed to be outside helping little kids cross the street.  oh, yeah, that.  i quit.  all: what.  i guess i just wasn't cut from the cloth after all.  not cut from the cloth.  but, mikey, you didn't even do it one whole day.  and what a rotten day it was.  i had to get up early and miss breakfast, and when i tried to stop some kids from skateboarding in the streets, they spat at me.  it was your dream.  not anymore.  now i got a new dream to be a jet pilot.  see how these guys fly around in the clouds, soaring and diving and hey, where did everybody go.  captions by vitaccaptions paid for by abc cable networks group ariel, stop
