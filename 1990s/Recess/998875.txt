  mommy.    mommy, mommy, mommy.   mama's girl. mama's girl.  mama's girl.  mama's girl.  mama's girl.  mama's girl.  ..ma's...gril.  noooooooo.  mikey, i'm passing my abc gum on to you.  keep adding to it.  it's halfway to a world record.  gosh, spinelli, ..forever.  come on, spinelli, aren't you overreacting just a bit.  i'm leaving and never coming back.  it's the only way.  hey, it's not that bad.  .  i'm the laughingstock of the playground.  i can't cross the lunchroom without kids half my age giggling at me.  used to be the name "spinelli" struck fear into kids' hearts.  now it just squirts milk out their noses.  teej, i know you always admired my eraser indy car.  it's yours.  i won't need it where i'm going.  spinelli, you're 9 years old.  where you gonna go.  i don't know.  someplace far, far away.   it ain't so bad out here.  sure, it's cold and little lonely, but i'm happy.  " yoohoo, is mama's little girl ready for school.  ah.  it's time for school, dear.  i'm not going.  go away.  young lady, you're gonna be late.  noi'm i'll never be late again because i'm not going to school ever.  never, never, ever.  you can't make me.  you can't make me.  you can't make me.  she made me.  well, it happened spinelli's hit what recovery professionals " why did it have to be spinelli.  why couldn't some other kid " wait a minute, mikey.  you may have something there.  i do. all right.  yeah, if we could get another kid to accidentally call a teacher "mama " then spinelli wouldn't feel like such a freak of nature.  exactly.  that's crazy.  what kid would worship a teacher " i think i owust the y.  now all we gotta do is lure finster into the puddle with randall nearby.  his weird affection for her should make him call out just like spinelli did.  can i just say once again, this plan is nuts.  here comes finster.  and, i saw larry smith, aka smitty, selling bubble gum for a profit, and then  ..  randall, why are you blubbering like a sick emu.  oh.  randall, you feeb.  don't just stand there, help me out of this mess.   ha ha ha ha.  i told you that plan was crazy.  bustagut funny, but crazy.  okay, time for plan b.  gus, you ready with that note.  ..me...daddy.  here you go.  hiya, principle prickly.  how'it hanging.  hands off the sport coat, boy.  it's silk.  hi, dubby.  good morning, dabby.  howdy, diddy.  sorry, guys, i guess i shouldn't have taken this chance to practice my cursive.  there's gotta be some way to get another kid " well, there is one thing we haven't tried.  advertisers use subliminal messages to communicate with consumers secretly.  thmessage is played at ultrahigh speed so it gets inside your head, and you don't even realize it.  you expect us to believe that.  how else do you explain your rabid desire for wiggerdiggers despite their lack of flavor.  good point.  let's do this thing.  mama, daddy, mama, daddy,  mama, daddy, mama, daddy, ..   sounds like gerbils on helium.  that, or spinelli's salvation.  push the button, vince.   what is that infernal chirping.  the birds they're planning something.  the kindergartners must have given helium to the gerbils again.  you know, life with you guys is never boring.  shh, you hear something.  children:  ..  it worked.  it worked.  it worked.  it worked.  mama. day. mama. daddy.  mama. daddy.  mama. daddy.  you okay, man.  ..  considering my life's like a stephen king novel.  a rollercoaster ride i couldn't put down.  oh, come on, spinelli, this is all gonna blow over eventually.  sure, i'll bet everybody's forgotten all about it by now.  i i that's it.  i've had it, you punks.  i'm gonna cream every last one of you.  miss spinelli, would you please sit down.  mmm, an excellent drawing, and i do applaud selfexpression, but people, this just isn't good karma.  this sort of satire is best used against, oh, say, a repressive totalitarian government.  you know, i was a child myself once.  the world can be a cruel place people treating each other terribly for no reason.  but it doesn't have to be that way not if we look out for each other.  a little empathy on the playground, a little consideration in the lunchroom will go a long way toward making our world a better place.  i mean, being a kid is hard enough without kids being hard on each other, right.  doesn't anyone understand basically where i'm coming from.  uh, can i say something.  .  well, i think i know what you're getting at, and, um, ..   ..mama.   did you hear that.  " now he's a mama's boy.  teej, are you crazy.  it's the only way,pinelli.  you've clarified the concept for me as well, mama.  yeah, mama, coming in loud and clear.  sure, mama, whatever you say.  me, too, mommy " same here, mama.  you got it, mama.  hey, mama.  all right, mama.    yay.  yay.  yay.  yay.  i don't know how to thank you for standing up for me in there.  's selfless actions, kids everywhere may never again be forced to stand and say, " kids everywhere.  who cares about them.  there's only one thing i care about spinelli is once again the toughest kid this school has ever seen.  well, you wanted her back, and we got her.  you know, there's one thing i still don't understand.  why did the subliminal message fail.  works all the time for madison avenue.  : who knows, gretchen.  who knows.  well, so ends another day filling the empty minds of future generations.  good night, mama.  good night, daddy.  locationwith lovato to talk about the new radio disney jams 12 cd,out now, featuring a never beforereleased jonas brothers song and some of today'shottest artists singing today's biggest hits,like demi.  so what's it l againon the cd.  it's definitely an honor to be a part of theradio disney jams 12cd.  .

a special viewing apparatus like the one ..  come on, we better get her to school.  ...and it lights up...   uhoh.  what is it.  purple day.  what's purple day.  that.  it's the one day every year when the ashleys all wear purple.  hey, second grader, nice ensemble.  not.  not.  not.   purple day.  just another dumb excuse for them to pick on everyone.  maybe they won't see me.  hey, grendler,

guys looking at.  noooooo.  , you have been accused of high crimes against the clique of forgetting purple day, our most sacred fashion day of the year.  bigger than hat day, more ..  even more hallowed than the week ..  for purple day marks the anniversary when all of us ..  we were ashleys in the making.  ew. as if.  i'm ashley.  what's your name.  like, i'm ashley, too.  no way, that's my name.  i totally can't believe this.  on that day, henceforth known as "purple day," a clique was born.  we took an oath, swearing allegiance and dedicating ourselves ..  and, most importantly, promising to wear purple on purple day.  but today you violated that promise, ashley a.  and when you did, you, like, totally tainted the ashley name.  , you ice.  i've got just three words to say to you i'm, like, so sure.   get ahold yourself, ashley a.  daddy ways said beauty, style, and attitude would prevail.  you just need to find a new clique a better clique.  hmm, let's see what we have to work with.  hi, there.  you know, your hair would keep its shape better if you used a little mousse.  like,voil.  do me a favor go away.  i mean, it's not like i need them.  i'm the one who always knows what's coming into style.  i'm the one who always starts the latest trends, and i'm the one who gets all the fashion channels.  hello, are you guys even listening to me.   hello..   cavein.  cavein.   she collapsed tunnel three.  we've been working on it since first grade.  all right, fine, i'm going.  it was filthy down there anyway.  we poke a pinhole in one side of the box and cut a slat in the other.  the light shines through the pinhole.  when you look through the slat, you see the eclipse. fun, huh.  fun wasn't exactly the word i was thinking of.  building a pinhole projector doesn't seem like recess.  i mean, it's schoolwork.  you mean, you don't want to help.  ..  anybody for dodge ball.  see ya.   i don't understand it.  there should be a line of kids fighting to be my friend.  ..the fashion gods must be testing me.  hi, gretchen, how's it going.  fine.  like, whatcha doing.  making a pinhole projector.  you need any help.  did you just ask to help me.  ..yeah.

around the sun.  daddy always said the world revolved around me.  uhoh.  i can't believe she's hanging out with that loser geek.  how could she stoop so low.  you'd think gretchen would have better taste.  you know, gretchen should be our friend, not that disgusting ashley a.'s.  you are so right, ashley q.  come on.  hello, gretchen, gretchen's friend.  so, what's in the box.  a pinhole projector.  and i made it so we could watch the eclipse.  you children wouldn't understand.  for your information, we're totally into astrology.  don't you mean astronomy.  whatever. what's your sign.  well, um, my birthday's march that makes you an aries.  we're totally compatible.  we are.  i'm a gemini, and geminis get along with aries even better.  not as good as leos.  i beg to differ.  maybe

something no kid can resist.  so, it's, like, all of us after school at the mall.  that is, like, so totally brilliant, gretchen.  aren't you forgetting grasshopper, formaldehyde we had plans.  don't worry, i'm sure i can squeeze everyone in.  hey, gretchen, come on.  set off a stink bomb in prickly's office.  sorry, guys, i'm, like, totally booked.  this is a lot more rare than a solar eclipse.  oh, so many friends, so little time.  . gretchen, those girls aren't your friends.  they're ashleys.  we're your friends.  oh, really.  who helped me build my pinhole projector.  who shares my interest in science and astronomy.  you guys. not.  she's right. she's right.   like,voil.  i can't get over how much better your pinhole thingy looks in pink.  there's no reason science can't be colorcoordinated.  well, i should have known.  holding the eclipse without me.  actually you promised to do it with me, not with these fashion rejects.  if that isn't suede calling the vinyl dclass.
