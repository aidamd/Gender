splash a mysterious old man, gennai, told the children to leave for server continent. trusting his words, the children left file island. upon learning that the tags, one of the objects needed to enable their digimon to evolve further, were located in an underwater cave, they defeated the tags' bodyguard, drimogemon. obtaining the tags, they once again headed for server continent. etemon. grand entrance of evil etemon. grand entrance of evil today's the fifth day since we've set sail. we're almost there. is that server continent. yes. all right. hey guys, wake up. it's the continent. we've reached server continent. what's all the noise. what was that you said about a comestible feast. note: tairiku = continent. taiyaki = fishshaped cake filled with sweet beanpaste. not "comestible," i said "continent." look, it's server continent. continent. so we're finally here. all right, we're here. wow, what a big island. it's not an island, it's a continent. this is my first time seeing so much land on the horizon. wake up, mimi. you can see server continent. it's the continent. the continent. i'd rather have regular cake than taiyaki oh, mimi come on, mimichan. be brave. why do we have to get off here. aren't there better places to land.. well there is an inlet a little bit up north where it appears to be easier for us to get off that's why we all held a discussion and decided to land here. you were sleeping, though. don't decide on important things like that without me there. there you go. i hate this. farewell, everyone. take care. thanks, whamon. take care. well, where do we go now. whamon told us that if we walk ahead, we'll reach a koromon village in the forests within half a day. koromon. i think i've heard that name before. i used to be a koromon. oh yeah. the koromon should be willing to help us. all right then, let's go. we're really on a continent hey, what's with the obvious remarks. because, we've been walking for so long and the scenery hasn't even changed a single bit. i thought once we reached shore, i could take a bath. you can, once we reach the village. when will we get there then. what hour, what minute, what second. well agumon, what's up. i smell koromon over here. what. it's a forest. a forest. think the koromon village is over there. wait, taichi. taichisan. it's the koromon village. a bath. hey, mimi, wait. what's wrong, agumon. this isn't the place. a bath, a bath, a bath. hey, where are your baths. huh. did koromon always look like this. no, these are pagumon. pagumon baby lesser digimon type virus special attack bubbles a baby digimon who loves to bully the weak and make fools out of others. mimi. mimisan. mimi. those guys took her. this wasn't the koromon village. guess not. which way did she go. over there. mimi. mimisan. there's mimichan's hat. it's definitely hers. hey, isn't that mimikun's bag. you're right. it can't be anyone else's but hers. she must be in here. don't, taichi. mimi. ah, this is paradise~ mimimisan what are you peeping in here for.. there's a lady in here. nno, that's not why we i tried to stop you welcome. welcome. this is the pagumon village. apparently this was a pagumon village. a village of happiness. that's weird i'm sure i smelled koromon here welcome. welcome. thank you for waiting. i feel like lady otohime when she arrived at the coral palace. this is the pagumon village. you're mixing up characters. you mean urashima. a village of happiness. you don't think these are fake, do you. as if stuff like that happens twice. welcome. welcome. delicious. it's real. this is the pagumon village. but that's odd. i've heard that pagumon are rascals. a village of happiness. it must be a rumor. yes, yes, it's just a rumor. welcome. they're really nice digimon. welcome. yes, yes, we're very nice digimon. this is the pagumon village. a village of happiness. poyo~ it's tokomon. you evolved. that great, takeru. the next time you evolve, you'll be patamon. takeru. let's do our best together. applause, everyone. congratulations. congratulations. whwhy are you doing this.. because you evolved. that's right, that's right. you aren't nice digimon.. it was an act. you're all stupid for falling for it. what are you doing over there. gazimon. gazimon child mammal digimon type virus special attack paralyze breath gazimon. they have a vicious and aggressive temperament. their special attack, paralyze breath, is a mass of electricity that numbs their opponents. where'd that tokomon come from. hhe came with a bunch of humans. humans. stay quiet in here, you. stay quiet, you. who would have guessed that the chosen children would show up here. i'll go inform etemonsama about this. you guys take care of the rest. gotcha. you lot, don't let the children escape. okay~. this way. etemonsama. where are you. etemonsama. etemonsama. etemonsama. etemonsama. the kanji on the trailer mean "laughing gate of the heavens" and read as "etemon. " etemonsama. yeah yeah. who's the strongest in the world. that would be me, etemon. etemon perfect puppet digimon type virus special attack dark spirits love serenade etemon. a digimon who claims himself to be the strongest. his two powerful attacks, dark spirits and love serenade, are truly befitting that selfproclamation. all hail etemonsama. king of digimon. shut up. you're too loud for so early in the morning. perhaps you should take your own advice, sir shut up. silence. according to my calculations, the chosen children will be landing here soon. i'm going to ambush them and crush them all then and there. a nice plan, if i do say so myself. if you make any loud noises, the children will hear you. the children won't be there. the chosen children came yesterday and landed someplace else. they're in the pagumon village right now. whwhat.. how did that happen.. why. why.. that's not our latest transmission. you're right. now my plan is ruined. i'll never forgive them for this. be sure to remember this. arise, my dark network. go. etemonsama. won't you be gathering up your subordinates. i'll be more than enough for the chosen children on my own. tokomon. tokomon. tokomon. tokomon. where is he. tokomon. answer if you can hear me. no good. he wasn't here. i thought i could finally take a break. i wish he'd stop making us go through all this trouble. and just who do you think gave us the most trouble all this time. jyousenpai. he means you. he wasn't here. he wasn't here. he wasn't near the waterfall. i see. tokomon hey, tokomon. they're very faint, but i can smell so many familiar things all over the village. this smell it's definitely the smell of koromon. agumon. tokomon. koromon. why are you all locked up in here. this is really our village. two or three days earlier, the pagumon came here and took over our homes. then that means those guys are bad guys who are big fat liars. you have to let everyone know. i'll get you out of here quick. oh, you're not allowed to do that. you guys are gazimon. that's because we'll be offering the chosen children to etemonsama. etemon. we'll get rid of you right here. agumon. tokomon is still a baby, so he shouldn't have been able to go that far he's late where is agumon searching. paralyze breath. two against one isn't fair. you can do it, agumon. taichi, let me evolve. it's no use. no one can hear you from outside. damn it, if this waterfall wasn't here waterfall. that's it. baby flame. baby flame. baby flame. where are you aiming, moron. baby flame. what's that. what's wrong, taichi. i see smoke over there. what's that. it's tokomon. that can't be. we just searched near that waterfall. we searched, we searched. but it's possible he arrived there after you finished searching. i'll go look. you can't. why not. we're just going to take a look. well because whwhat is this thing. it's a botamon. how can a botamon be here. what do you mean. botamon is the digimon that evolves into koromon. he shouldn't be in a pagumon village. then this place really is welcome. welcome. this is not the pagumon village. they're running away. those tricksters. agumon. give up. now you're finished. taichi agumon. taichi. agumon. agumon, are you okay. taichi it's a chosen child. time to evolve, agumon. taichi agumon, evolve. greymon. anyone can run and give up nigetari akirameru koto wa daremo it's payback time. mega flame. when given a second, so let's keep on walking instead isshun areba dekiru kara arukitsuzukeyou there's something only you can do kimi ni shika dekinai koto ga aru aoi hoshi ni you did it. tokomon. thank goodness you're safe. i'm sorry for worrying you, takeru. so that this blue planet doesn't lose its light hikari ga nakusenu you ni the pagumon have run away. it's all right now. thank you. hello. what's with that voice. chosen children, can you hear me. it's etemon. how dare you make a fool out of me. since you've pissed me off, i'm going to destroy everything in this village. everything in the village. there's no way he can do that. dark network. everyone. okay. gabumon, evolve. garurumon. i won't let you do that. love serenade. what's wrong with you guys.. ii can't feel any power. his love serenade drains you of your ability to fight. is there any other way to fight against him. not while we're in this state. if we were able to evolve to a higher level if garurumon evolved to a greater level, it would be possible, right. so this is why gennaisan told us to get the tags and crests. it's too late for us to realize that now. this way, everyone. there's a legend that if anything were to happen to our village, we were to escape from here. what's this symbol. this is a crest. what. i have a crest. all right. look. ththis is we're inside the mountains that are far, far away from where our village is. then we're saved. thank goodness. a crest i finally have one. as long as i have this, etemon isn't a threat at all. etemonsama, the chosen children. the chosen children should be flying about in broken pieces by now. they've been abruptly transported elsewhere. what.. you're right quite unexpected to see them over there. i'll have to stay on my guard around those children. but that's what makes it worth killing them. voices yagami taichi takenouchi sora ishida yamato izumi koushiro tachikawa mimi takaishi takeru kido jyou fujita toshiko
