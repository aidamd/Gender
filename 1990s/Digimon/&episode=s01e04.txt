"100 percent." nnever mind, don't worry about it. "be held responsible." i said, never mind. don't worry about it. i want to know more about what you're talking about, sora. tell me. okay. you don't need to know that. stop playing around, you two. you're so relaxed. i'm not playing around because i want to. piyomon is a very sociable digimon. i see. so each digimon has a different personality. sora sora can i really get along with a mushy digimon like her. we can get out of the forest. this is like the african savannah i saw on tv. does that mean there'll be lions and giraffes here. dunno. it'll be nice if we saw normal animals like that though. there aren't any animals like that here. that's correct. there are only digimon here. only digimon, huh. koushiro, were there telephone poles in the savannah you saw. no, there weren't. there must be some people nearby. there has to be. but it could end up the same as the phone booths at the beach, or the trolley at the lake. no, that can't be. re absolutely, positively are people here. koushirohan. koushirohan. telling you, there are only digimon here. where can we be. tada. what's going on.. this looks like sand, but it's actually powdered iron. that's what's attracting the magnet. we really must have come to an unbelievable place. it's also very hot here. we should get some water as soon as we can. yeah. you're right. where is this place.. so hot maybe we should have stayed in the forest at this rate, we'll overheat are you hot, gomamon. i want ice or at least some water want to wear my hat, palmon. thank you it looks good on you. mimichan never mind. sora sora. let's keep walking. you're so energetic. sora sora oh, just cut it out. right now, i'm really thirsty, tired, and i'm sick of walking, so stop clinging to me. it's making me even more tired. sora is tired i'm sorry. i'll keep quiet. fine, fine. you can walk with me. i'm so happy. sora, i love you. but man, we keep walking and walking, and nothing comes into sight. maybe it's best if we go back to the forest. wait just a second. it's a village. , see, see . a village. i knew there must be people here. in any case, it's worth checking out. i'm so thirsty, palmon i'm so hungry me too, me too. all right then. let's head to that village. it was a pyocomon village. pyocomon. you're all my friends. hey, hey. what kind of digimon are you. me. no, no. these people aren't digimon, they're something called humans. they're really nice. "humans." they're not digimon.

"y'know." what's that mean. are those words that all piyomon use. no, these are words that sora uses. i learn so many words being with her. oh, i get it. but why were you able to evolve. can you evolve just by being with a human. it must be because i had to protect sora. "protect." protect me. that's right. what i mean by protecting sora is how can she say that, being as loveydovey as she is. but, come to think of it then whenever i'm in danger it can't be. sora all of the pyocomon have offered to give us a feast. rreally. yahoo. a million thanks to the pyocomonsama. i'm so hungry. let's eat 'til we're stuffed. i wonder what food they'll give us water. water. water. water. there's a fountain over there. water, water. this fountain is connected to a water source in miharashi mountain. it's really yummy. this is the famous delicious water from miharashi mountain. miharashi mountain. that mountain. that mountain. burning. no. i was so thirsty. i didn't even get a sip yet. what's going on. why is this happening. ddon't worry. there's a pond over there. let's take a look.
