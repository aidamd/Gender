taichi and yamato, mimi and koushiro, and jyou and sora all overcame their odds to assemble back at infinity mountain. however, takeru and patamon were still the only ones who had yet to meet the others. adventure. patamon and i adventure. patamon and i you failures. my apologies. we almost had them whwhat are you doing, sir.. i don't want to hear your excuses. forgive me, devimonsama. please forgive me. thank you. thanks, patamon. you saved me. no need to thank me. we're friends. you're right. whwhat's wrong, takeru.. wwe got separated from oniichan and the others. at a time like this if i were piyomon piyomon, evolve. birdramon. but why why can't i evolve. what's wrong, patamon. because. because. i want to evolve and fly high in the sky too. evolve. hey, what kind of digimon do you evolve into anyway. what kind. i won't know until i evolve into it. do you know, takeru. it's probably like this 'mon. tabunkonnamon  adult imaginary digimon type imaginary special attack buubuu attack it'sprobablylikethismon. its special attack is buubuu attack. buu. no. then it must be like this 'mon. kittokonnamon  adult imaginary digimon type imaginary special attack hippopota vacuum itmustbelikethismon. its special attack is hippopota vacuum. no way. then forget it. stop thinking about it. it doesn't matter. i just won't evolve anymore. where should we go. anywhere. i'll follow you wherever you choose, takeru. then this way. it's so pretty. yeah. let's go look inside. okay. this feels like a big bed. it's so soft. it feels great. this is fun, right, takeru. takeru. there's something over there. let's take a look. they're cradles. what's this. a botamon. it's a baby digimon. it's so cute. feels like jelly. well, it was just born. what about the others. who's this. punimon. let's go over there. this is a baby too. it looks like an old man with a beard. don't say that, you'll hurt its feelings. it's still a respectable baby. its name is yuramon. achoo. achoo. achoo. hey, what are these. they're digieggs. digieggs. a digimon egg. oh, so digimon are born from eggs. like chickens. yeah, that's right. even devimon. yyeah huh. what's this. rub me. rub. but rub who. who. maybe the digieggs. see. wanna try it. sure. rub rub rub. rub rub. once more, rub rub rub rub rub. it hatched. all right. this one doesn't have a crib. maybe there's one over there oh, so that's how it works. you didn't know about this. but you're a digimon. i don't remember the time when i was a baby. do you, takeru. i'm not sure. i probably don't remember. see. let's go rub the digieggs over there. no fair, wait for me. rub rub. rub rub. sparkling thunder. elecmon adult mammal digimon type data special attack sparkling thunder elecmon. a very inquisitive mammal digimon who enjoys pulling pranks. he threatens his enemies by spreading his tail like a peacock. easy stuff. this is more than enough. just you wait, babies. i'll be back soon with tons of food. what now. are you hungry. just wait a second. ah it pooped. hey, this one pooped. i'm busy over here. ah, peekaboo. take care of it yourself. what should i do.. where are you going.. having a big catch is nice, but it's tough work dragging it all back. huh. the babies are crying. did something happen to them. hey, why are you crying. oh, don't cry. who are those guys. no, what's more important is that the babies are in danger. you two. sparkling thunder. look out, takeru. what are you doing.. that's dangerous. of course it is. i was aiming at you. why'd you do that.. because you were coddling my babies. well, we did coddle them, but what's wrong with that. yeah. tsk tsk. your lack of insight is so troublesome. listen, the word "coddle" not only means the usual definition of "petting" someone, but also "bullying" them as well. but they both mean something completely different. that's weird. anyway, we weren't bullying them. just looking over them. let me tell you this, no one asked you to take care of them in the first place. you tell us off, but what are you to the babies anyway. what am i. well, i'm their guardian, their housekeeper, their food provider, and wait, who cares about that.. you brat. you're still a brat too. now i'm mad. i'm going numb. it's dangerous to touch me. air shot. you little. stop stop it i said stop stop stop please stop. stop it, you two. fighting is bad. you're scaring the babies too. sorry for scaring you. don't go acting so familiar towards my babies, you brat. hey, did you guys know this. the ones who think they're grownup are actually the biggest brats of all. aren't they dumb. what the heck.. if you've got a problem, say it to my face. you're the type who puts on a nice face but talks about others behind their backs, right.. geez. please, takeru, let me at him. i wanna settle things with this guy. so do i. bring it on. do you really want to fight. of course. then do it fair and square i got it. i have a good idea. to the east~ elec of the vast sea. elec of the vast sea. to the west~ pata of the large mountain. pata of the large mountain. both sides on your marks. get ready keep going. keep going. keep going. why do i have to do this. i'm not gonna lose. keep going. keep going. pata of the mountain wins. yay.. i won.. well. wanna go again. we can keep doing it until you're satisfied. keh. don't take pity on me. a loss is a loss. welcome to the village of beginnings. you're warmly received here. i'm really sorry about that. some weird stuff's been happening around here, y'know. and to top it off, the island breaks apart i started being wary of outsiders. well, i guess this goes to show i'm still too much of a brat. fighting between friends is okay, because you'll make up soon. but fighting between adults you're surprisingly stronger than you look. than i look. i don't think i like being judged by the size of my appearance. heh, my bad. but it's really like you said. er, what was it again. "a grain of pepper may be tiny, but it's still sharp on the tongue," or something like that. note: the quote from elecmon means, "a little body often harbors a great soul. " however, patamon heard him wrong, resulting in a mixup of similarsounding words. "a pansy may be tiny, but it's still sharp on the tongue." have you ever eaten pansies before. huh. did i screw that up. oh, whatever. you can rest as long as you want here. 'though i guess you can't really do that since taking care of the babies is a fulltime job. by the way, do you know how to get back to that mountain. mmountain. yyou mean, infinity mountain.. yeah. yyou want to climb that mountain. i really suggest you don't. devimon is over there. i know. i have to go and ask him where my brother and the others are. he's not just gonna quietly tell you the answer. after all, he is an evil digimon. if you really want to know, you'll have no choice but to defeat him. i don't want to fight. but even if you don't there should be another way. some way we can settle things without fighting. if there was think back on what you felt a moment ago. we all laughed together, remember. yeah. i think something will happen when our hearts become one. something will happen. maybe.. where are you going. i'll be away a bit in gear savannah. you went through the pyocomon village there, right. i'll tell them about what happened here. maybe if we get our hearts to become one, the island will join back together again into one piece. and the island will be back to normal. it's just a feeling but that's what i want to believe. okay. see ya. be careful. oniichan i didn't think it would end up like this i was unable to put a stop to them before they evolved but no matter. i only need to destroy the one digimon who has yet to evolve. as long as i defeat one chosen child, my victory is ensured. leomon. i leave it to you. understood. uum, whad'ya i mean, what shall i do. nothing, for the time being. but our final battle won't be long. it won't hurt to stack the odds in our favor. understood. i'll strangle the life out of them this time. as the time drew near, the destiny of file island no, the entire digital world, was put at stake, as justice and evil, light and dark, surged towards each other. yes. it wouldn't be long before the fight between these two sides would commence. fffeel what's wrong. feel itchy. nice to meet 'cha. congratulations. that's great. i'm also going to evolve one day. i don't mind that, but will i be able to stay friends with takeru after i evolve. what. what's wrong. oh, nothing do you want to evolve too. nno, that's not it. i don't mind staying like this. i'll stay in this form forever, right by your side, takeru. yeah. it's a promise. we'll be friends forever. of course. friends. voices takaishi takeru patamon konishi hiroko matsumoto miwa voices elecmon koromon botamon punimon poyomon yuramon unimon takato yasuhiro kiuchi reiko chizuka miki hanioka yukiko shiomi kaoru muraoka yukie fujimoto noriko voices devimon ogremon leomon/narration shiozawa kaneto egawa hisao hirata hiroaki devimon's ambition to rule file island is too great for garurumon, greymon, and the others to stop. frustrated from being unable to evolve and protect his beloved takeru, patamon's screams melt into his tears. but then an angel of light appears to drive away the evil darkness. next time on digimon adventure: angemon awakens. angemon awakens. now the adventure evolves. )
