thanks to the power of the tag and crest, greymon finally evolved into his perfect level form, metalgreymon. after being sucked into the dimensional rift that emerged from etemon's defeat, taichi and koromon found they were the only ones back in the human world. however, upon discovering that the distortions in the digimon world were also affecting their world, taichi and agumon returned once more to the digimon world where their friends awaited them. the whispering little demon, picodevimon. the whispering little demon, picodevimon. hey. where are you, guys. hey. no one's here. i wonder where they've gone, taichi what's that. the digivice is reacting to something. what's this mean. it's only reacting when i turn in this direction. everyone must be over there. i'm sure of it. anyway, let's head in the direction where it's beeping. i didn't know there was a river in this area. since there's a river here, that must mean we're near the edge of the desert. there's a bridge. is that the ocean. it's not an ocean. it's a lake. there's something near the lake. the signal's getting stronger. they're close by. it's tokomon. tokomon. hang in there. are you okay. taichi agumon. you're alive. of course we are. more importantly, did you get beaten by the enemy, tokomon. no, i wasn't. i collapsed because i was just so hungry and tired. where's takeru. takeru is with picodevimon. picodevimon. who's that. picodevimon is um tell me everything from the beginning. what happened to everyone while we were away. okay. after you two were gone, we let's look for them. let's keep looking for taichi and agumon until we find them. it's impossible. we've already been searching for a month and a half. there's no trace of them anywhere. gennaisan he should know something. let's go look for gennaisan. we don't even know where he is. how would we begin to find him. i just want to go home. takeru will cry if we don't tell him. the two of us are going to look for taichi. take care, tokomon. after that, everyone left one after the other. the only ones who stayed together were me, takeru, yamato, and gabumon. hey, oniichan. i wonder where everyone went. you don't need to worry about them. they can take care of themselves. we don't have anymore enemies like devimon and etemon either. oniichan. let's go back. let's go back and look for taichisan. we've already looked everywhere. just give up. but i'm sorry. don't cry, takeru. i'm sure taichi and agumon are doing fine somewhere. they're alive, right. taichisan is alive, right. we'll see him again someday. isn't that great, takeru. could that be an amusement park. we can have some fun. that place looks safe. i'll be okay. i'll wait. good boy, takeru. but come back quickly, okay. okay. i'm just going to check things out. it shouldn't take more than two or three hours. i'll be back before you know it. make sure to take good care of takeru, tokomon. oniichan. come back soon. we're counting on you, tokomon. takeru. time for dinner. oniichan is late eat some food. i'm not hungry. oniichan oniichan why won't oniichan come back. takeru. oniichan oniichan said he was just going to take a look around he said he'd be back soon. don't cry, takeru. oh my, what do we have here. hello there. i'm picodevimon. picodevimon. picodevimon child small demon digimon type virus special attack pico darts picodevimon. a small child level digimon shaped like a bat. oh. could you be the ones who got rid of etemon for us. yeah. thank you. peace has returned to this world because of you. but why were you crying. my brother won't come back. why, that's quite a fix. very well, i'll go look for him. what's your brother's name. he's called yamato. okay. wait right here. i hope he finds him. where's my brother. did you find him. yes, i did. where was he. i have a message from yamato. yamato said that he doesn't want to see your face anymore. he said he really, really, really hates you. he doesn't want to be your brother anymore. no way takeru, don't cry. oh, yamato also said this. he really hates you for being a crybaby. takeru. well, me too. me too. i hate you, oniichan. hey hey. yamato would never say that about you. hey, takeru. what'd you want to talk about. don't lie to takeru. lie. what did i lie about. you said yamato hated takeru. oh. how is that a lie. do you have any proof it isn't. if you've got proof, show me. i don't have that, but so in other words, you're suspecting me without any justification. know something. that's called "defamation. " you make false judgments based on the situation. how about it, want to take this to court and see if you'll win. what are you doing, tokomon.. what do you mean. you just attacked him for no reason. takeru, don't blame tokomon. he was just jealous that you and i are getting along, and he reacted like the child he is. right, tokomon. what's with that attitude.. apologize to picodevimon. no. i won't. apologize. never. if you're going to force me to apologize to him, then i'm leaving. oh really. then leave. you want me to leave. go ahead. i'm really leaving. fine. oh yeah. since we don't have anymore enemies, i don't need these. let's go, picodevimon. takeru, you idiot. idiot. idiot... so that's why you were alone here. yeah. i'm worried about yamato, but we need to see takeru first. take us to the amusement park where takeru is, tokomon. okay. so that's the place. how do we get revenge for etemonsama. can you even do it. those guys are really strong. yeah, we might not be enough to stop them. let's just give up. we're not obligated to go that far. come to think of it, he was always walking all over us. anyway, you feeling hungry. yeah, i am. oh, these mushrooms look good. let's have some. wah, this is fun. we're up so high, it's like walking through the sky~ look, the lake stretches so far out there. enjoying yourself. not really. crap, he's still worried about tokomon. hey, takeru. do you want to go driving. okay go. go. drive. drive. isn't this fun. doesn't it feel exciting. next is the roller coaster. getting ready for departure. yahoo. having fun. yeah no good. he's not getting into it. this is bad. hey, takeru. are you still thinking about tokomon. who cares about him.. i was just wondering if he's okay by himself but i really don't care about him at all. he still can't forget about tokomon after all. i've got to do something. ah, takeru. i just remembered i have something to do. like what. oh, it's nothing big. i'll be right back. my digivice is reacting. takeru must be close by. takeru, where are you. takeru. takeru. takeru. tataichisan. takeru. you're alive. i won't die that easily. thank goodness. i'm so glad you're alive. i was worried. i was really worried about you. sorry for worrying you. you're back, tokomon. do you realize now what you did wrong. i didn't do anything wrong. tokomon. when did you start getting that attitude. now, now. tokomon told me everything that's happened. this isn't the time to be disagreeing among friends. let's go look for yamato and the others. no. why. everyone left me. first it was sorasan and then and then in the end, even my own brother i'm sure he had a reason for that. no. everyone hates me. they hate me because i'm a kid and i cry easily. i don't know what picodevimon told you but there's no way yamato would hate you. you think so. but when you and i get along, oniichan gets a nasty look on his face. even when i told him we should look for you, he was against it. he started hating me because i kept talking about you, taichisan. taichisan, i want to be your younger brother. um, well, that's a little can't i. no, i mean, it's not that, but this is a problem. aren't you guys etemon's followers. who's that. do you know. by the way, who are you. who am i. i forgot. what's wrong with you. these are the mushrooms of forgetfulness. one bite of these and you forget all of your past memories. i see, you must've eaten them. wait a second, that's it. if i make takeru eat these in any case, let's look for yamato and hear what he has to say facetoface. ah, picodevimon's back. that's him. not only is takeru here, but so are tokomon and a few others. hey, tokomon, how are you doing. hey. we want to ask you something. whwho are you people. i'm taichi. this is agumon. what did yamato tell you. yamato, is it. he said he didn't want to be with takeru anymore. see, when i heard that, i tried to persuade him by telling him he shouldn't say those things about his younger brother, but yamato just wouldn't listen. is that the truth. i never lie. could you take us to where yamato is. but it's a little far. that doesn't matter. okay then. oh, by the way. would you like to eat something before we set off. eeat. i'm kind of hungry. i guess we should eat then. here are some delicious mushrooms. help yourselves. wait. it tastes better cooked. wow, it smells so good. they're not done yet. wait for me. i'm going to the bathroom. if you don't hurry up, you won't get your share. bathroom~ bathroom~ the same mushrooms are here too. ah, bathroom, bathroom~ i guess this is about right. here, have some. they don't know a thing. nothing. oh, wait. i forgot to add the seasoning. are these mushrooms really edible. don't eat them. if you eat those mushrooms, you'll lose all of your memories. that's odd but if what that voice said is true, then taichi's in trouble. let's eat. too bad. you'll have to cool it off first. there, that should do it. thanks, taichisan. don't eat them. don't eat those mushrooms. don't worry, i left some for you. no, you can't eat them. what's up with you. you eat them. go on, eat them, picodevimon. of course he won't. if you eat those things, they'll erase all of your memories. no way. is that true, picodevimon. wwell you lied about yamato too, right.. you lied about everything, right.. yes. that's mean. that's really mean. i'm sorry, tokomon. i treated you so horribly. i know. don't worry about it. tokomon takeru. guess the misunderstanding is all cleared up now. here, these are yours. thanks. nnot good you bastard. i'll get in trouble if you have that. hand it over. i'll protect takeru. tokomon. tokomon, evolve. patamon. baby flame. pico darts. anyone can run and give up nigetari akirameru koto wa

made, agumon. good thing you figured out what those mushrooms really were. actually, a voice told me. whose. dunno i was so close. ii'm very sorry. the crest of hope has regained its light. i'm not sure how they're doing it, but the distortions from this world are affecting the real world. that's why we need to fix them here before we go back home. in order to do that, everyone needs to combine their strengths. that includes you, takeru. i'll do my best. yeah, that's the spirit. now let's go look for the others. taichi and the others went on a journey to search for their friends. but just
