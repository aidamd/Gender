doubt about it now. this is near my place. your place. i'm back in japan. i'm back. it must be because we got sucked into that rift. that's gotta be the reason why you're back to koromon too. we did it. that's great, taichi. we did it. we did it. take a look, koromon. this is my place. no way. it's big. i wonder how mom and dad are doing. i've been completely off the radar, so they must be really worried about me. taichi, hurry up and greet them. yeah, you're right. huh. but come to think of it how long have i been in the other world. a month. a year. or maybe even maybe mom and dad have already forgotten about me. what'll i do if i open this door and some complete stranger comes out, asking me who i am. taichi. are you okay. oh i'm hoi mean, excuse me. hey this is my house. i mean, of course it is. it's much smaller than it looked. does that taste good. does it. how long has it been since i had cola. gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme~~.. i really am back in my own world but what day is it today. it looks like it's still summer what's wrong, taichi.. it's august today is still august 1st, 1999. what do you mean. august 1st, 1999 was the day when we all left for camp. what's going on. it should have taken days, even months, being in the other world we walked for so many days we fought with so many digimon so why is it still august 1st. why is it still the afternoon of that day. did i become so homesick that i'm dreaming i'm here right now. or maybe the time i spent in the other world was all a dream, and i'd really collapsed in that park. taichi. taichi. taichi. koromon. oniichan you're back home yyeah oniichan. is she your little sister. i told you not to talk. hikari, it's not what you think. this guy is koromon is with you. koromon

back home midway and yes, sorry. hello, is sora. i see. is yamato there. oh no one's back. are those guys still in the other world. or maybe i really am the only one who's dreaming. which is real. or
